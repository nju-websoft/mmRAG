It is\nthe third installment in the [_Indiana Jones_\nfranchise](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_\\(franchise\\) \"Indiana Jones \\(franchise\\)\").\n[Harrison Ford](/wiki/Harrison_Ford \"Harrison Ford\") reprises [the title\nrole](/wiki/Indiana_Jones \"Indiana Jones\") and [Sean\nConnery](/wiki/Sean_Connery \"Sean Connery\") plays Indiana's father, [Henry\nJones, Sr.](/wiki/Henry_Jones,_Sr. \"Henry Jones, Sr.\") Other cast members\nfeatured include [Alison Doody](/wiki/Alison_Doody \"Alison Doody\"), [Denholm\nElliott](/wiki/Denholm_Elliott \"Denholm Elliott\"), [Julian\nGlover](/wiki/Julian_Glover \"Julian Glover\"), [River\nPhoenix](/wiki/River_Phoenix \"River Phoenix\"), and [John Rhys-\nDavies](/wiki/John_Rhys-Davies \"John Rhys-Davies\"). In the film, set largely\nin 1938, Indiana searches for his father, a [Holy Grail](/wiki/Holy_Grail\n\"Holy Grail\") scholar, who has been kidnapped by [Nazis](/wiki/Nazi_Germany\n\"Nazi Germany\").\n\nAfter the mixed reaction to _[Indiana Jones and the Temple of\nDoom](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom \"Indiana Jones and the Temple\nof Doom\")_ , Spielberg chose to compensate with a film that toned down the\nviolence and gore. During the five years between _Temple of Doom_ and _Last\nCrusade_ , he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before\naccepting [Jeffrey Boam](/wiki/Jeffrey_Boam \"Jeffrey Boam\")'s.

While scouting caves, Indy discovers a group of grave robbers who\nhave found a golden [crucifix](/wiki/Crucifix \"Crucifix\") belonging to\n[Coronado](/wiki/Francisco_V%C3%A1squez_de_Coronado \"Francisco Vásquez de\nCoronado\") and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men\ngive chase through a passing [circus train](/wiki/Circus_train \"Circus\ntrain\"), leaving Indy with a bloody cut across his chin from a\n[bullwhip](/wiki/Bullwhip \"Bullwhip\") and a new [phobia of\nsnakes](/wiki/Ophidiophobia \"Ophidiophobia\"). Indy escapes, but the local\nsheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers. Impressed with Indy's\nbravery, the leader of the robbers gives Indy his [fedora](/wiki/Fedora\n\"Fedora\"), and encourages him to not give up.\n\nIn 1938, Indy recovers the cross off the coast of\n[Portugal](/wiki/Estado_Novo_\\(Portugal\\) \"Estado Novo \\(Portugal\\)\") and\ndonates it to [Marcus Brody](/wiki/Marcus_Brody \"Marcus Brody\")'s museum.\nLater, Indy is introduced to [Walter Donovan](/wiki/Walter_Donovan \"Walter\nDonovan\"), who informs him that Indy's father, [Henry Jones\nSr.](/wiki/Henry_Jones_Sr. \"Henry Jones Sr.\"), has vanished while searching\nfor the [Holy Grail](/wiki/Holy_Grail \"Holy Grail\"), using an incomplete\ninscription as his guide. Indy then receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from\n[Venice](/wiki/Venice \"Venice\"). Realizing that he would not have sent the\ndiary unless he was in trouble, Indy and Marcus travel to Venice, where they\nmeet Henry's [Austrian](/wiki/Federal_State_of_Austria \"Federal State of\nAustria\") colleague, Dr. [Elsa Schneider](/wiki/Elsa_Schneider \"Elsa\nSchneider\"). Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa\ndiscover the tomb of a [First Crusade](/wiki/First_Crusade \"First Crusade\")\nknight, which also contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry\nhad used, this one revealing the location of the Grail. They flee, however,\nwhen the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a\n[secret society](/wiki/Secret_society \"Secret society\") that protects the\nGrail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood,\n[Kazim](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Kazim \"List of\ncharacters in the Indiana Jones series\"), and Indy tells him that his goal is\nonly to find his father and that he has no interest in finding the Grail.\nKazim tells him that Henry is being held in Castle Brunwald on the Austrian-\nGerman border. Marcus later reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the\nGrail, which begins in [Alexandretta](/wiki/%C4%B0skenderun \"İskenderun\").\nIndy removes the pages containing the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus\nfor safekeeping and sends Marcus to İskenderun, the city built on the ruins of\nAlexandretta to rendezvous with their old friend [Sallah](/wiki/Sallah\n\"Sallah\"), and he and Elsa head to Castle Brunwald.\n\nAt Castle Brunwald, Indy rescues Henry, but learns that Elsa and Donovan are\nactually working with the [Nazis](/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi Germany\"), and are\nusing him to find the Grail for them. Meanwhile, Marcus is captured in\n[Hatay](/wiki/Hatay_State \"Hatay State\"), while waiting with\n[Sallah](/wiki/Sallah \"Sallah\") for the Joneses. The Joneses escape from\nCastle Brunwald. Henry tells Indy that to reach the Grail, one must face three\n[booby traps](/wiki/Booby_trap \"Booby trap\") and his diary contains the clues\nto guide them through the challenges safely. They recover the diary from Elsa\nat a [book burning](/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings \"Nazi book burnings\") rally in\n[Berlin](/wiki/Berlin \"Berlin\"). They then board a [Zeppelin](/wiki/Zeppelin\n\"Zeppelin\") to leave Germany, but the Nazis soon discover the Joneses are\naboard and they escape in a [parasite](/wiki/Parasite_aircraft \"Parasite\naircraft\") [biplane](/wiki/Biplane \"Biplane\"). They crash while engaging in a\n[dogfight](/wiki/Dogfight \"Dogfight\") with [Luftwaffe](/wiki/Luftwaffe\n\"Luftwaffe\") fighters.\n\nThe two meet up with Sallah in Hatay, where they learn of Marcus's abduction.\nThe Nazis are already moving toward the Grail's location, using the map\npossessed by Marcus. In exchange for a [Rolls-Royce](/wiki/Rolls-\nRoyce_Phantom_II \"Rolls-Royce Phantom II\"), the [Sultan](/wiki/Sultan\n\"Sultan\") of Hatay has given the Nazis full access to his equipment for the\nexpedition, including a large tank. Indy, Henry, and Sallah find the Nazi\nexpedition, which is ambushed by the Brotherhood. During the battle, Henry is\ncaptured by SS Colonel [Ernst\nVogel](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Vogel \"List of\ncharacters in the Indiana Jones series\") while attempting to rescue Marcus\nfrom the tank; Kazim and his comrades are killed. The younger Jones pursues\nthe tank on horseback and, with the aid of Sallah, saves Henry and Marcus. He\nis then caught up in a fight with Vogel, and barely escapes before the tank\ngoes over a cliff, crushing Vogel to death.\n\nIndy, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah catch up with the surviving Nazis, led by\nDonovan and Elsa, who have found the temple where the Grail is kept but are\nunable to pass through the three protective booby traps. Donovan mortally\nwounds Henry in order to force Indy to risk his life in the traps to find the\nGrail and use its healing power to save Henry. Using the information in the\ndiary and followed by Donovan and Elsa, Indy safely overcomes the traps and\nreaches the Grail's chamber, which is guarded by a knight. He has been kept\nalive for seven hundred years by the power of the Grail, which is hidden among\ndozens of false Grails; only the true Grail brings life, while a false one\nclaims it. Elsa purposefully selects the most princely grail, a golden chalice\nstudded with emeralds, for Donovan, who ages into dust after drinking from it,\nbecause the one Elsa chose was a false one. Indy selects the true Grail, a\nsimple wooden cup, which the knight warns cannot be taken beyond the temple's\nentrance. Indy fills the Grail with [holy water](/wiki/Holy_water \"Holy\nwater\") and takes it to Henry, which heals him instantly. Elsa, disregarding\nthe knight's warning, then takes the Grail and attempts to leave with it. The\ntemple begins to collapse and Elsa falls to her death trying to recover the\nGrail. Indy nearly suffers the same fate but Henry persuades him to let it go.\nThe Joneses, Marcus, and Sallah escape the temple and ride off into the\nsunset.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\nSee also: [List of characters in the Indiana Jones\nseries](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series \"List of\ncharacters in the Indiana Jones series\")\n\n  * [Harrison Ford](/wiki/Harrison_Ford \"Harrison Ford\") as [Indiana Jones](/wiki/Indiana_Jones \"Indiana Jones\"): The archaeologist adventurer who seeks to rescue his father and find the Holy Grail. Ford said he loved the idea of introducing Indiana's father because it allowed him to explore another side to Indiana's personality: \"These are men who have never made any accommodation to each other. Indy behaves differently in his father's presence. Who else would dare call Indy 'junior'?\"[3]\n    * [River Phoenix](/wiki/River_Phoenix \"River Phoenix\") as the teenage Jones. Phoenix had portrayed the son of Ford's character in _[The Mosquito Coast](/wiki/The_Mosquito_Coast \"The Mosquito Coast\")_ (1986). Ford recommended Phoenix for the part; he said that of the young actors working at the time, Phoenix looked the most like him when he was around that age.[4]\n  * [Sean Connery](/wiki/Sean_Connery \"Sean Connery\") as [Professor Henry Jones](/wiki/Henry_Jones,_Sr. \"Henry Jones, Sr.\"): Indiana's father, a professor of [Medieval literature](/wiki/Medieval_literature \"Medieval literature\") who cared more about looking for the Grail than raising his son. Spielberg had Connery in mind when he suggested introducing Indiana's father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as \"a crazy, eccentric\" professor resembling [Laurence Olivier](/wiki/Laurence_Olivier \"Laurence Olivier\"), whose relationship with Indiana is \"strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son\".[5] Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as [James Bond](/wiki/James_Bond_\\(character\\) \"James Bond \\(character\\)\") and felt that no one else could perform the role as well.[6] Spielberg biographer [Joseph McBride](/wiki/Joseph_McBride_\\(writer\\) \"Joseph McBride \\(writer\\)\") wrote, \"Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's [_James Bond_ movies](/wiki/James_Bond_\\(film_series\\) \"James Bond \\(film series\\)\").\"[7] Connery initially turned the role down as he is only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented. Connery—a student of history—began to reshape the character, and revisions were made to the script to address his concerns. \"I wanted to play Henry Jones as a kind of [Sir Richard [Francis] Burton](/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton \"Richard Francis Burton\"),\" Connery commented. \"I was bound to have fun with the role of a gruff, Victorian Scottish father.\"[6] Connery believed Henry should be a match for his son, telling Spielberg that \"whatever Indy'd done my character has done and my character has done it better\".[4] Connery signed to the film on March 25, 1988.[5] He improvised the line, \"She talks in her sleep\", which was left in because it made everyone laugh;[8] in Boam's scripts, Henry telling Indiana that he slept with Elsa occurs later.[5]\n    * [Alex Hyde-White](/wiki/Alex_Hyde-White \"Alex Hyde-White\") as Young Henry Jones, Sr.\n  * [Alison Doody](/wiki/Alison_Doody \"Alison Doody\") as [Dr. Elsa Schneider](/wiki/Dr._Elsa_Schneider \"Dr. Elsa Schneider\"): An Austrian art professor who is in league with the Nazis. She seduces the Joneses to trick them. Doody was 21 when she auditioned and was one of the first actresses who met for the part.[5]\n  * [Denholm Elliott](/wiki/Denholm_Elliott \"Denholm Elliott\") as Dr. Marcus Brody: Indiana's bumbling English colleague. Elliott returned after Spielberg sought to recapture the tone of _[Raiders of the Lost Ark](/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\")_ (1981), following the actor's absence in the darker _[Temple of Doom](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\")_ (1984).[4]\n  * [John Rhys-Davies](/wiki/John_Rhys-Davies \"John Rhys-Davies\") as [Sallah](/wiki/Sallah \"Sallah\"): A friend of Indiana and a professional [excavator](/wiki/Excavation_\\(archaeology\\) \"Excavation \\(archaeology\\)\") living in [Cairo](/wiki/Cairo \"Cairo\"). Like Elliott's, Rhys-Davies' return was an attempt to recapture the spirit of _Raiders of the Lost Ark_.[4]\n  * [Julian Glover](/wiki/Julian_Glover \"Julian Glover\") as Walter Donovan: An American businessman who sends the Joneses on their quest for the Holy Grail. Donovan works for the Nazis and desires [immortality](/wiki/Immortality \"Immortality\"). Glover previously appeared as [General Veers](/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_characters#V \"List of Star Wars characters\") in Lucas's _[The Empire Strikes Back](/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back \"The Empire Strikes Back\")_. He originally auditioned for the role of Vogel. Glover, who is English, adopted an American accent for the film,[9] but was dissatisfied with the result.[4]\n  * [Michael Byrne](/wiki/Michael_Byrne_\\(actor\\) \"Michael Byrne \\(actor\\)\") as [Colonel](/wiki/Standartenf%C3%BChrer \"Standartenführer\") Vogel: A brutal [SS](/wiki/Schutzstaffel \"Schutzstaffel\") colonel. Byrne and Ford had previously starred in _[Force 10 from Navarone](/wiki/Force_10_from_Navarone_\\(film\\) \"Force 10 from Navarone \\(film\\)\")_ (1978), in which they also respectively played a German and an American.[10]\n  * [Kevork Malikyan](/wiki/Kevork_Malikyan \"Kevork Malikyan\") as Kazim: The leader of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, an organization that protects the Holy Grail. Malikyan had impressed Spielberg with his performance in _[Midnight Express](/wiki/Midnight_Express_\\(film\\) \"Midnight Express \\(film\\)\")_ (1978) and would have auditioned for the role of Sallah in _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ had a traffic jam not delayed his meeting with the director.[10]\n  * [Robert Eddison](/wiki/Robert_Eddison \"Robert Eddison\") as the Grail Knight: The guardian of the Grail who drank from the cup of Christ during the Crusades and is immortal as long as he stays within the temple. Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing once before in film (a supporting role in Peter Ustinov's 1948 comedy _[Vice Versa)](/wiki/Vice_Versa_\\(1948_film\\) \"Vice Versa \\(1948 film\\)\")_. Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his film debut, often asking if he had performed correctly.[11] [Laurence Olivier](/wiki/Laurence_Olivier \"Laurence Olivier\") was originally considered to play the Grail Knight,[12] but he was too ill and died the same year in which the film was released.\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nLucas and Spielberg had intended to make a trilogy of _[Indiana\nJones](/wiki/Indiana_Jones \"Indiana Jones\")_ films since Lucas had first\n[pitched](/wiki/Pitch_\\(filmmaking\\) \"Pitch \\(filmmaking\\)\") _[Raiders of the\nLost Ark](/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\")_ to\nSpielberg in 1977.[13] After the mixed critical and public reaction to\n_[Indiana Jones and the Temple of\nDoom](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom \"Indiana Jones and the Temple\nof Doom\")_ , Spielberg decided to complete the trilogy to fulfill his promise\nto Lucas and \"to apologize for the second one\".[14] The pair had the intention\nof revitalizing the series by evoking the spirit and tone of _Raiders of the\nLost Ark_.[4] Throughout the film's development and [pre-\nproduction](/wiki/Pre-production \"Pre-production\"), Spielberg admitted he was\n\"consciously regressing\" in making the film.[7] Due to his commitment to the\nfilm, the director had to drop out of directing _[Big](/wiki/Big_\\(film\\) \"Big\n\\(film\\)\")_ and _[Rain Man](/wiki/Rain_Man \"Rain Man\")_.[13]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Xiyou.PNG/170px-\nXiyou.PNG)](/wiki/File:Xiyou.PNG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Xiyou.PNG \"Enlarge\")\n\nChris Columbus' script featured the Monkey King in Africa\n\nLucas initially suggested making the film \"a [haunted\nmansion](/wiki/Haunted_house \"Haunted house\") movie\", for which _[Romancing\nthe Stone](/wiki/Romancing_the_Stone \"Romancing the Stone\")_ writer [Diane\nThomas](/wiki/Diane_Thomas \"Diane Thomas\") wrote a script. Spielberg rejected\nthe idea because of the similarity to\n_[Poltergeist](/wiki/Poltergeist_\\(1982_film\\) \"Poltergeist \\(1982 film\\)\")_ ,\nwhich he had co-written and produced.[7] Lucas first introduced the [Holy\nGrail](/wiki/Holy_Grail \"Holy Grail\") in an idea for the film's prologue,\nwhich was to be set in Scotland. He intended the Grail to have a\n[pagan](/wiki/Pagan \"Pagan\") basis, with the rest of the film revolving around\na separate Christian artifact in Africa. Spielberg did not care for the Grail\nidea, which he found too [esoteric](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/esoteric\n\"wikt:esoteric\"),[3] even after Lucas suggested giving it healing powers and\nthe ability to grant immortality. In September 1984, Lucas completed an eight-\npage treatment titled _Indiana Jones and the[Monkey King](/wiki/Sun_Wukong\n\"Sun Wukong\")_, which he soon followed with an 11-page outline. The story saw\nIndiana battling a ghost in Scotland before finding the [Fountain of\nYouth](/wiki/Fountain_of_Youth \"Fountain of Youth\") in Africa.[5]\n\n[Chris Columbus](/wiki/Chris_Columbus_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Chris Columbus\n\\(filmmaker\\)\")—who had written the Spielberg-produced\n_[Gremlins](/wiki/Gremlins \"Gremlins\")_ , _[The Goonies](/wiki/The_Goonies\n\"The Goonies\")_ , and _[Young Sherlock Holmes](/wiki/Young_Sherlock_Holmes\n\"Young Sherlock Holmes\")_ —was hired to write the script. His first draft,\ndated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal\nPeaches. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron\nSeamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to\n[Mozambique](/wiki/Mozambique \"Mozambique\") to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a\n[Katharine Hepburn](/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn \"Katharine Hepburn\") type\naccording to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old [pygmy](/wiki/Pygmies\n\"Pygmies\"). The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and\nIndiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier—an old friend of Indiana—travel up the\n[Zambezi](/wiki/Zambezi \"Zambezi\") river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in\nthe climactic battle but is resurrected by the Monkey King. Other characters\ninclude a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a\nmechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with\nIndiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a [Toshiro\nMifune](/wiki/Toshiro_Mifune \"Toshiro Mifune\") type), who dies eating a peach\nbecause he is not pure of heart.[5]\n\nColumbus's second draft, dated August 6, 1985, removed Betsy and featured\nDash—an [expatriate](/wiki/Expatriate \"Expatriate\") bar owner for whom the\nNazis work—and the Monkey King as villains. The Monkey King forces Indiana and\nDash to play chess with real people and disintegrates each person who is\n[captured](/wiki/Capture_\\(chess\\) \"Capture \\(chess\\)\"). Indiana subsequently\nbattles the undead, destroys the Monkey King's rod, and marries Clare.[5]\n[Location scouting](/wiki/Location_scouting \"Location scouting\") commenced in\nAfrica but Spielberg and Lucas abandoned _Monkey King_ because of its negative\ndepiction of African natives,[15] and because the script was too\nunrealistic.[5] Spielberg acknowledged that it made him \"... feel very old,\ntoo old to direct it.\"[3] Columbus's script was leaked onto the Internet in\n1997, and many believed it was an early draft for [the fourth\nfilm](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull \"Indiana Jones\nand the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\") because it was mistakenly dated to\n1995.[16]\n\nUnsatisfied, Spielberg suggested introducing Indiana's father, [Henry Jones,\nSr.](/wiki/Henry_Jones,_Sr. \"Henry Jones, Sr.\") Lucas was dubious, believing\nthe Grail should be the story's focus, but Spielberg convinced him that the\nfather–son relationship would serve as a great metaphor in Indiana's search\nfor the artifact.[7] Spielberg hired [Menno Meyjes](/wiki/Menno_Meyjes \"Menno\nMeyjes\"), who had worked on Spielberg's _[The Color\nPurple](/wiki/The_Color_Purple_\\(1985_film\\) \"The Color Purple \\(1985\nfilm\\)\")_ and _[Empire of the Sun](/wiki/Empire_of_the_Sun_\\(film\\) \"Empire of\nthe Sun \\(film\\)\")_ , to begin a new script on January 1, 1986. Meyjes\ncompleted his script ten months later. It depicted Indiana searching for his\nfather in [Montségur](/wiki/Monts%C3%A9gur \"Montségur\"), where he meets a nun\nnamed Chantal. Indiana travels to [Venice](/wiki/Venice \"Venice\"), takes the\n_[Orient Express](/wiki/Orient_Express \"Orient Express\")_ to\n[Istanbul](/wiki/Istanbul \"Istanbul\"), and continues by train to\n[Petra](/wiki/Petra \"Petra\"), where he meets [Sallah](/wiki/Sallah \"Sallah\")\nand reunites with his father. Together they find the grail. At the climax, a\nNazi villain touches the Grail and explodes; when Henry touches it, he ascends\na stairway to [Heaven](/wiki/Heaven \"Heaven\"). Chantal chooses to stay on\nEarth because of her love for Indiana. In a revised draft dated two months\nlater, Indiana finds his father in [Krak des\nChevaliers](/wiki/Krak_des_Chevaliers \"Krak des Chevaliers\"), the Nazi leader\nis a woman named Greta von Grimm, and Indiana battles a demon at the Grail\nsite, which he defeats with a dagger inscribed with \"God is King\".

Spielberg suggested making Indiana a Boy Scout as\nboth he and Harrison Ford were former Scouts.\n\nSpielberg suggested _[Innerspace](/wiki/Innerspace \"Innerspace\")_ writer\n[Jeffrey Boam](/wiki/Jeffrey_Boam \"Jeffrey Boam\") perform the next rewrite.\nBoam spent two weeks reworking the story with Lucas, which yielded a treatment\nthat is largely similar to the final film.[5] Boam told Lucas that Indiana\nshould find his father in the middle of the story. \"Given the fact that it's\nthe third film in the series, you couldn't just end with them obtaining the\nobject. That's how the first two films ended,\" he said, \"So I thought, let\nthem _lose_ the Grail, and let the father–son relationship be the main point.\nIt's an archaeological search for Indy's own identity and coming to accept his\nfather is more what it's about [than the quest for the Grail].\"[7] Boam said\nhe felt there was not enough character development in the previous films.[3]\nIn Boam's first draft, dated September 1987, the film is set in 1939. The\nprologue has adult Indiana retrieving an Aztec relic for a museum curator in\nMexico and features the circus train. Henry and Elsa (who is described as\nhaving dark hair) were searching for the Grail on behalf of the Chandler\nFoundation, before Henry went missing. The character of Kazim is here named\nKemal, and is an agent of the Republic of Hatay, which seeks the grail for its\nown. Kemal shoots Henry and dies drinking from the wrong chalice. The Grail\nKnight battles Indiana on horseback, while Vogel is crushed by a boulder when\nstealing the Grail.[5]\n\nBoam's February 23, 1988 rewrite utilized many of Connery's comic suggestions.\nIt included the prologue that was eventually filmed; Lucas had to convince\nSpielberg to show Indiana as a boy because of the mixed response to _Empire of\nthe Sun_ , which was about a young boy.[3] Spielberg—who was later awarded the\n[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award](/wiki/Distinguished_Eagle_Scout_Award\n\"Distinguished Eagle Scout Award\")—had the idea of making Indiana a [Boy\nScout](/wiki/Boy_Scout \"Boy Scout\").[13] [Indiana's\nmother](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Anna \"List of\ncharacters in the Indiana Jones series\"), named Margaret in this version,\ndismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado, while his\nfather is on a long distance call. Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation\nfeatures, but is not the main villain; he plunges to his death in the tank.\nElsa introduces Indiana and Brody to a large Venetian family that knows Henry.\n[Leni Riefenstahl](/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl \"Leni Riefenstahl\") appears at the\nNazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal\ntries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is\nrepeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking from\nthe wrong Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the chasm\nwhile grasping for the Grail. Boam's revision on March 1 showed Henry causing\nthe seagulls to strike the plane, and has Henry saving Indiana at the\nend.[5][17]\n\nBetween an undated \"Amblin\" revision and a rewrite by [Tom\nStoppard](/wiki/Tom_Stoppard \"Tom Stoppard\") (under the pen name Barry Watson)\ndated May 8, 1988,[5] further changes were made. Stoppard polished most of the\ndialogue,[8][18] and created the \"Panama Hat\" character to link the prologue's\nsegments featuring the young and adult Indianas. The Venetian family is cut.\nKemal is renamed Kazim and now wants to protect the grail rather than find it.\nChandler is renamed Donovan. The scene of Brody being captured is added. Vogel\nnow dies in the tank, while Donovan shoots Henry and then drinks from the\nfalse grail, and Elsa falls into the chasm. The Grail trials are expanded to\ninclude the stone-stepping and leap of faith.[5][19]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Double_Arch.jpg/220px-\nDouble_Arch.jpg)](/wiki/File:Double_Arch.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Double_Arch.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Double Arch in the [Arches National Park](/wiki/Arches_National_Park\n\"Arches National Park\") in [Utah](/wiki/Utah \"Utah\"), [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Buerresheim_1.jpg/220px-\nBuerresheim_1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Buerresheim_1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Buerresheim_1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Bürresheim\nCastle](/w/index.php?title=B%C3%BCrresheim_Castle&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Bürresheim Castle \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n[(de)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_B%C3%BCrresheim \"de:Schloss\nBürresheim\"), near [Mayen](/wiki/Mayen \"Mayen\"), in the [German](/wiki/Germany\n\"Germany\") state of [Rhineland-Palatinate](/wiki/Rhineland-Palatinate\n\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"), served as the \"Brunwald Castle\" in Austria near the\nGerman border\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Administration_Building%2C_Treasure_Island_%28San_Francisco%29.jpg/220px-\nAdministration_Building%2C_Treasure_Island_%28San_Francisco%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Administration_Building,_Treasure_Island_\\(San_Francisco\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Administration_Building,_Treasure_Island_\\(San_Francisco\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Administration Building](/wiki/Administration_Building,_Treasure_Island\n\"Administration Building, Treasure Island\"), on [Treasure\nIsland](/wiki/Treasure_Island,_California \"Treasure Island, California\"), in\n[San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\"),\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\"), served as the \"Berlin Airport\"\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Playa-de-\nmonsul.jpg/220px-Playa-de-monsul.jpg)](/wiki/File:Playa-de-monsul.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Playa-de-monsul.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Mónsul beach in the [Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural\nPark](/wiki/Cabo_de_Gata-N%C3%ADjar_Natural_Park \"Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural\nPark\") in [Almería](/wiki/Almer%C3%ADa \"Almería\"), [Spain](/wiki/Spain\n\"Spain\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Tabernas2.jpg/220px-\nTabernas2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tabernas2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tabernas2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe tank chase was filmed in the [Tabernas Desert](/wiki/Tabernas_Desert\n\"Tabernas Desert\") in Almería, Spain\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\nbegan on May 16, 1988, in the [Tabernas Desert](/wiki/Tabernas_Desert\n\"Tabernas Desert\") in [Spain](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\")'s [Almería\nprovince](/wiki/Almer%C3%ADa_\\(province\\) \"Almería \\(province\\)\"). Spielberg\noriginally had planned the chase to be a short sequence shot over two days,\nbut he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece.[4]\nThinking he would not surpass the truck chase from _Raiders of the Lost Ark_\n(because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence\nshould be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each\nother. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming\nit.[20] The [second unit](/wiki/Second_unit \"Second unit\") had begun filming\ntwo weeks before.[11] After approximately ten days, the production moved to\n[Bellas Artes](/wiki/Museo_de_Bellas_Artes_de_Sevilla \"Museo de Bellas Artes\nde Sevilla\") to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. [Cabo de\nGata-Níjar Natural Park](/wiki/Cabo_de_Gata-N%C3%ADjar_Natural_Park \"Cabo de\nGata-Níjar Natural Park\") was used for the road, tunnel and beach sequence in\nwhich birds strike the plane. The shoot's Spanish portion wrapped on June 2,\n1988, in [Guadix](/wiki/Guadix \"Guadix\"), [Granada](/wiki/Granada_\\(province\\)\n\"Granada \\(province\\)\"), with filming of Brody's capture at İskenderun train\nstation.[11] The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere,\nrather than adding it as a visual effect.[20]\n\nFilming for the castle interiors took place in the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") from June 5 to 10, 1988, at\n[Elstree Studios](/wiki/Elstree_Studios \"Elstree Studios\") in\n[Borehamwood](/wiki/Borehamwood \"Borehamwood\"), [England](/wiki/England\n\"England\"). On June 16 [Lawrence Hall, London](/wiki/Lawrence_Hall,_London\n\"Lawrence Hall, London\"), was used for the airport interiors. Filming returned\nto Elstree the next day to capture the motorcycle escape, continuing at the\nstudio for interior scenes until July 18. One day was spent at [North Weald\nAirfield](/wiki/North_Weald_Airfield \"North Weald Airfield\") on June 29 to\nfilm Indiana leaving for Venice.[11] Ford and Connery acted much of the\nZeppelin table conversation without trousers on because of the overheated\nset.[21] Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy interrupted the shoot to make a plea\nto the [Parliament of the United\nKingdom](/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Parliament of the United\nKingdom\") to support the economically \"depressed\" British studios. July 20–22\nwas spent filming the temple interiors. The temple set, which took six weeks\nto build, was supported on 80 feet of hydraulics and ten\n[gimbals](/wiki/Gimbal \"Gimbal\") for use during the earthquake scene.\nResetting between takes took twenty minutes while the hydraulics were put to\ntheir starting positions and the cracks filled with plaster. The shot of the\nGrail falling to the temple floor—causing the first crack to appear—was\nattempted on the full-size set, but proved too difficult. Instead, crews built\na separate floor section that incorporated a pre-scored crack sealed with\nplaster. It took several takes to throw the Grail from six feet onto the right\npart of the crack.[20] July 25–26 was spent on night shoots at [Stowe\nSchool](/wiki/Stowe_School \"Stowe School\"), [Stowe,\nBuckinghamshire](/wiki/Stowe,_Buckinghamshire \"Stowe, Buckinghamshire\"), for\nthe Nazi rally.[11]\n\nFilming resumed two days later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the\nlibrary, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences.[11] The steamship\nfight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-\nforty-feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks—each holding\nthree hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000 lb.) of water—were used\nin the scene.[20] Henry's house was filmed at [Mill Hill](/wiki/Mill_Hill\n\"Mill Hill\"), London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice in front of a ship's\npropeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a [long focus\nlens](/wiki/Long_focus_lens \"Long focus lens\") to make it appear the actors\nwere closer to the propeller than they really were.[11] Two days later, on\nAugust 4, another portion of the boat chase using [Hacker\nCraft](/wiki/Hacker_Craft \"Hacker Craft\") sport boats, was filmed at [Tilbury\nDocks](/wiki/Port_of_Tilbury \"Port of Tilbury\") in [Essex](/wiki/Essex\n\"Essex\").[11] The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by\nfirst cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved\ntogether while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats\nscraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was\nlaunched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that\nhelped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat\nlanded too short of the camera in the first attempt.[20] The following day,\nfilming in England wrapped at the [Royal Masonic\nSchool](/wiki/Royal_Masonic_School \"Royal Masonic School\") in\n[Rickmansworth](/wiki/Rickmansworth \"Rickmansworth\"), which doubled for\nIndiana's college (as it had in _Raiders of the Lost Ark_).[11]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Petra_Jordan_BW_21.JPG/170px-\nPetra_Jordan_BW_21.JPG)](/wiki/File:Petra_Jordan_BW_21.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Petra_Jordan_BW_21.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Al Khazneh](/wiki/Al_Khazneh \"Al Khazneh\") (The Treasury) at Petra, Jordan\nwas used for the entrance to the temple housing the Holy Grail\n\nShooting in Venice took place on August 8.[11] For scenes such as Indiana and\nBrody greeting Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where\nhis father is,[20] [Robert Watts](/wiki/Robert_Watts \"Robert Watts\") gained\ncontrol of the [Grand Canal](/wiki/Grand_Canal_\\(Venice\\) \"Grand Canal\n\\(Venice\\)\") from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists for as long as possible.\nCinematographer [Douglas Slocombe](/wiki/Douglas_Slocombe \"Douglas Slocombe\")\npositioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible.[11] [San\nBarnaba di Venezia](/wiki/San_Barnaba_di_Venezia \"San Barnaba di Venezia\")\nserved as the library's exterior.[4] The next day, filming moved to the\nancient city of [Petra](/wiki/Petra \"Petra\"), [Jordan](/wiki/Jordan \"Jordan\"),\nwhere [Al Khazneh](/wiki/Al_Khazneh \"Al Khazneh\") (The Treasury) stood in for\nthe temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of [King\nHussein](/wiki/Hussein_of_Jordan \"Hussein of Jordan\") and [Queen\nNoor](/wiki/Queen_Noor_of_Jordan \"Queen Noor of Jordan\"). The Treasury had\npreviously appeared in _[Sinbad and the Eye of the\nTiger](/wiki/Sinbad_and_the_Eye_of_the_Tiger \"Sinbad and the Eye of the\nTiger\")_. The main cast completed their scenes that week, after 63 days of\nfilming.[11]\n\nThe second unit filmed part of the prologue's 1912 segment from August 29 to\nSeptember 3. The main unit began two days later with the circus train sequence\nat [Alamosa, Colorado](/wiki/Alamosa,_Colorado \"Alamosa, Colorado\"), on the\n[Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad](/wiki/Cumbres_and_Toltec_Scenic_Railroad\n\"Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad\"). They filmed at [Pagosa\nSprings](/wiki/Pagosa_Springs,_Colorado \"Pagosa Springs, Colorado\") on\nSeptember 7, and then at [Cortez](/wiki/Cortez,_Colorado \"Cortez, Colorado\")\non September 10. From September 14 to 16, filming of Indiana falling into the\ntrain carriages took place in Los Angeles. The production then moved to Utah's\n[Arches National Park](/wiki/Arches_National_Park \"Arches National Park\") to\nshoot more of the opening. A house in Antonito, Colorado was used for the\nJones family home.[22] The production had intended to film at [Mesa Verde\nNational Park](/wiki/Mesa_Verde_National_Park \"Mesa Verde National Park\"), but\n[Native American](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native\nAmericans in the United States\") representatives had religious objections to\nits use.[20] When Spielberg and editor [Michael\nKahn](/wiki/Michael_Kahn_\\(film_editor\\) \"Michael Kahn \\(film editor\\)\")\nviewed a [rough cut](/wiki/Rough_cut \"Rough cut\") of the film in late 1988,\nthey felt it suffered from a lack of action. The motorcycle chase was shot\nduring [post-production](/wiki/Post-production \"Post-production\") at [Mount\nTamalpais](/wiki/Mount_Tamalpais \"Mount Tamalpais\") and\n[Fairfax](/wiki/Fairfax,_California \"Fairfax, California\") near [Skywalker\nRanch](/wiki/Skywalker_Ranch \"Skywalker Ranch\"). The closing shot of Indiana,\nHenry, Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in\n[Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\") in early 1989.[11][9]\n\n###\nDesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\nMechanical effects supervisor [George\nGibbs](/wiki/George_Gibbs_\\(special_effects_artist\\) \"George Gibbs \\(special\neffects artist\\)\") said the film was the most difficult one of his career.[20]\nHe visited a museum to negotiate renting a small French [World War I\ntank](/wiki/Tanks_in_World_War_I \"Tanks in World War I\"), but decided he\nwanted to make one.[11] The tank was based on the [Tank Mark\nVIII](/wiki/Tank_Mark_VIII \"Tank Mark VIII\"), which was 36 feet (11 m) long\nand weighed 28 short tons (25 t). Gibbs built the tank over the framework of a\n28-short-ton (25 t) [excavator](/wiki/Excavator \"Excavator\") and added\n7-short-ton (6.4 t) [tracks](/wiki/Continuous_track \"Continuous track\") that\nwere driven by two automatic [hydraulic pumps](/wiki/Hydraulic_pump \"Hydraulic\npump\"), each connected to a [Range Rover](/wiki/Range_Rover \"Range Rover\") [V8\nengine](/wiki/Rover_V8_engine \"Rover V8 engine\"). Gibbs built the tank from\nsteel rather than aluminum or fiberglass because it would allow the\nrealistically [suspensionless](/wiki/Suspension_\\(vehicle\\) \"Suspension\n\\(vehicle\\)\") vehicle to endure the rocky surfaces. Unlike its historical\ncounterpart, which had only the two side guns, the tank had a turret gun added\nas well. It took four months to build and was transported to Almería on a\n[Short Belfast](/wiki/Short_Belfast \"Short Belfast\") plane and then a low\nloader truck.[20]\n\nThe tank broke down twice. The [distributor](/wiki/Distributor\n\"Distributor\")'s rotor arm broke and a replacement had to be sourced from\n[Madrid](/wiki/Madrid \"Madrid\"). Then two of the device's valves used to cool\nthe oil exploded, due to [solder](/wiki/Solder \"Solder\") melting and mixing\nwith the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten\nfans, and the lack of suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking\nduring filming breaks.[20] The tank only moved at 10 to 12 miles per hour (16\nto 19 km/h), which [Vic Armstrong](/wiki/Vic_Armstrong \"Vic Armstrong\") said\nmade it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making\nit appear faster.[11] A smaller section of the tank's top made from aluminum\nand which used rubber tracks was used for close-ups. It was built from a\nsearchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive\ntruck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling\noff.[20] A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a 50-foot (15 m) cliff\non location; [Industrial Light & Magic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic\n\"Industrial Light & Magic\") created further shots of the tank's destruction\nwith models and miniatures.[23]\n\n[Michael Lantieri](/wiki/Michael_Lantieri \"Michael Lantieri\"), mechanical\neffects supervisor for the 1912 scenes, noted the difficulty in shooting the\ntrain sequence. \"You can't just stop a train,\" he said, \"If it misses its\nmark, it takes blocks and blocks to stop it and back up.\" Lantieri hid handles\nfor the actors and stuntmen to grab onto when leaping from carriage to\ncarriage. The carriage interiors shot at [Universal Studios\nHollywood](/wiki/Universal_Studios_Hollywood \"Universal Studios Hollywood\")\nwere built on tubes that inflated and deflated to create a rocking motion.[20]\nFor the close-up of the rhinoceros that strikes at (and misses) Indiana, a\nfoam and fiberglass animatronic was made in London. When Spielberg decided he\nwanted it to move, the prop was sent to [John Carl\nBuechler](/wiki/John_Carl_Buechler \"John Carl Buechler\") in Los Angeles, who\nresculpted it over three days to blink, snarl, snort and wiggle its ears. The\ngiraffes were also created in London. Because steam locomotives are very loud,\nLantieri's crew would respond to [first assistant\ndirector](/wiki/Assistant_director#Sub-roles \"Assistant director\") [David\nTomblin](/wiki/David_Tomblin \"David Tomblin\")'s radioed directions by making\nthe giraffes nod or shake their heads to his questions, which amused the\ncrew.[23] For the villains' cars, Lantieri selected a 1914 [Ford Model\nT](/wiki/Ford_Model_T \"Ford Model T\"), a 1919 [Ford Model\nT](/wiki/Ford_Model_T \"Ford Model T\") truck and a 1916\n[Saxon](/wiki/Saxon_\\(automobile\\) \"Saxon \\(automobile\\)\") Model 14, fitting\neach with a [Ford Pinto](/wiki/Ford_Pinto \"Ford Pinto\") [V6\nengine](/wiki/V6_engine \"V6 engine\"). Sacks of dust were hung under the cars\nto create a dustier environment.[20]\n\nSpielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into striking the\nGerman plane because the real gulls used in the first take did not fly.[4] In\nDecember 1988, Lucasfilm ordered 1,000 disease-free gray rats for the\ncatacombs scenes from the company that supplied the snakes and bugs for the\nprevious films. Within five months, 5,000 rats had been bred for the\nsequence;[4] 1,000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire.\nSeveral thousand snakes of five breeds—including a [boa\nconstrictor](/wiki/Boa_constrictor \"Boa constrictor\")—were used for the train\nscene, in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix could fall. The snakes\nwould slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust\nafter filming to find and return them. Two lions were used, which became\nnervous because of the rocking motion and flickering lights.[20]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/LastCrusadeTank.jpg/220px-\nLastCrusadeTank.jpg)](/wiki/File:LastCrusadeTank.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:LastCrusadeTank.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nComposite photograph of the tank on location\n\nCostume designer [Anthony Powell](/wiki/Anthony_Powell_\\(designer\\) \"Anthony\nPowell \\(designer\\)\") found it a challenge to create Connery's costume because\nthe script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout. Powell\nthought about his own grandfather and incorporated\n[tweed](/wiki/Tweed_\\(cloth\\) \"Tweed \\(cloth\\)\") suits and fishing hats.\nPowell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses, but did not want to hide\nConnery's eyes, so chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he\nhad them specially made. The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in\nEastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave\nresearch pictures and drawings for reference.[11] The motorcycles used in the\nchase from the castle were a mixed bag: the scout model with sidecar in which\nIndy and Henry escape was an original [Dnepr](/wiki/Dnepr_\\(motorcycle\\)\n\"Dnepr \\(motorcycle\\)\"), complete with machine gun\n[pintle](/wiki/Pintle_mount#Pintle \"Pintle mount\") on the sidecar, while the\npursuing vehicles were more modern machines dressed up with equipment and\nlogos to make them resemble German army models. Gibbs used Swiss [Pilatus\nP-2](/wiki/Pilatus_P-2 \"Pilatus P-2\") army training planes standing in for\n[Messerschmitt Bf-109s](/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf-109 \"Messerschmitt Bf-109\"). He\nbuilt a device based on an [internal combustion\nengine](/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine \"Internal combustion engine\") to\nsimulate gunfire, which was safer and less expensive than firing\n[blanks](/wiki/Blank_\\(cartridge\\) \"Blank \\(cartridge\\)\").[23] Baking soda was\napplied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to\ncreate the foaming effect as the water from the Grail washes it away.[23] At\nleast one reproduction [Kubelwagen](/wiki/Kubelwagen \"Kubelwagen\") was used\nduring filming despite the film being set two years prior to manufacture of\nsaid vehicles.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n###\nEffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Effects\")]\n\n[Industrial Light & Magic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic \"Industrial Light\n& Magic\") (ILM) built an eight-foot foam model of the Zeppelin to complement\nshots of Ford and Connery climbing into the biplane. A biplane model with a\ntwo-foot wingspan was used for the shot of the biplane detaching. [Stop\nmotion](/wiki/Stop_motion \"Stop motion\") animation was used for the shot of\nthe German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The\ntunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two\nmonths. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section\nto be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against\n[bluescreen](/wiki/Chroma_key \"Chroma key\"); the sequence required their car\nto have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was\nremoved and later [composited](/wiki/Compositing \"Compositing\") into the shot.\nDust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it\nappear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred\n[tim-birds](/wiki/Tim-bird \"Tim-bird\") were used in the background shots of\nthe seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped\nfeather-coated crosses onto the camera. These only looked convincing because\nthe scene's quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls.[23] ILM's\n[Wes Takahashi](/wiki/Wes_Takahashi \"Wes Takahashi\") supervised the film's\neffects sequences.[24]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d2/Leapoffaith.jpg/220px-\nLeapoffaith.jpg)](/wiki/File:Leapoffaith.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Leapoffaith.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIndiana discovers a bridge hidden by [camouflage](/wiki/Camouflage\n\"Camouflage\"). Ford was filmed in front of a bluescreen for the scene, which\nwas completed by a model of the bridge filmed against a matte painting\n\nSpielberg devised the three trials that guard the Grail.[3] For the first, the\nblades under which Indiana ducks like a penitent man were a mix of practical\nand miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM. For the second trial, in which\nIndiana spells \"[Iehova](/wiki/Jehovah \"Jehovah\")\" on stable stepping stones,\nit was intended to have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps\non \"J\". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman\nhanging through a hole that appears in the floor, 30 feet above a cavern. As\nthis was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were\nrushed late in production. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana\nmakes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden\nby [forced perspective](/wiki/Forced_perspective \"Forced perspective\"), was\ncreated with a model bridge and painted backgrounds. This was cheaper than\nbuilding a full-size set. A puppet of Ford was used to create a shadow on the\n9-foot-tall (2.7 m) by 13-foot-wide (4.0 m) model because Ford had filmed the\nscene against bluescreen, which did not incorporate the shaft of light from\nthe entrance.[23]\n\nSpielberg wanted Donovan's death shown in one shot, so it would not look like\nan actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to\n[Julian Glover](/wiki/Julian_Glover \"Julian Glover\")'s forehead and cheeks\nthat made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial\ndecomposition, as well as a mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of\nDonovan's death was created over three months by [morphing](/wiki/Morphing\n\"Morphing\") together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a\ntechnique ILM mastered on _[Willow](/wiki/Willow_\\(film\\) \"Willow \\(film\\)\")_\n(1988).[21] A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the\npuppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because [Alison\nDoody](/wiki/Alison_Doody \"Alison Doody\")'s double had not been filmed for the\nscene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot\nhad to be used throughout, with the other faces [mapped](/wiki/Texture_mapping\n\"Texture mapping\") over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a\n[marionette](/wiki/Marionette \"Marionette\"); it required several takes to film\nit crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon\nimpact.[23]\n\n[Ben Burtt](/wiki/Ben_Burtt \"Ben Burtt\") designed the sound effects. He\nrecorded chickens for the sounds of the rats,[11] and digitally manipulated\nthe noise made by a Styrofoam cup for the castle fire. He rode in a biplane to\nrecord the sounds for the dogfight sequence, and visited the demolition of a\n[wind turbine](/wiki/Wind_turbine \"Wind turbine\") for the plane crashes.[23]\nBurtt wanted an echoing gunshot for Donovan wounding Henry, so he fired a\n[.357 Magnum](/wiki/.357_Magnum \".357 Magnum\") in [Skywalker\nRanch](/wiki/Skywalker_Ranch \"Skywalker Ranch\")'s underground car park, just\nas Lucas drove in.[11] A rubber balloon was used for the earthquake tremors at\nthe temple.[25] The film was released in selected theaters in the 70 mm Full-\nField Sound format, which allowed sounds to not only move from side to side,\nbut also from the theater's [front to its rear](/wiki/Quadraphonic_sound\n\"Quadraphonic sound\").[23]\n\n[Matte paintings](/wiki/Matte_painting \"Matte painting\") of the Austrian\ncastle and German airport were based on real buildings; the Austrian castle\nwas a small West German castle that was made to look larger. Rain was created\nby filming granulated [Borax](/wiki/Borax \"Borax\") soap against black at high\nspeed. It was only lightly [double\nexposed](/wiki/Multiple_exposure#Double_exposure \"Multiple exposure\") into the\nshots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The airport\nused was at San Francisco's [Treasure\nIsland](/wiki/Treasure_Island_\\(California\\) \"Treasure Island\n\\(California\\)\"), which already had appropriate [art deco](/wiki/Art_deco \"Art\ndeco\") architecture. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage\nautomobiles and a sign stating \"Berlin Flughafen\". The establishing shot of\nthe Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were\nbacklit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings were used for the sky and to\ngive the appearance of [fill light](/wiki/Fill_light \"Fill light\") in the\nshadows and [rim light](/wiki/Backlighting_\\(lighting_design\\) \"Backlighting\n\\(lighting design\\)\") on the edges of the buildings.[23]\n\n##\nThemes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Themes\")]\n\nA son's relationship with his estranged father is a common theme in\nSpielberg's films, including _[E.T. the Extra-\nTerrestrial](/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\")_\nand _[Hook](/wiki/Hook_\\(film\\) \"Hook \\(film\\)\")_.[7]\n\nThe film's exploration of fathers and sons coupled with its use of religious\nimagery is comparable to two other 1989 films, _[Star Trek V: The Final\nFrontier](/wiki/Star_Trek_V:_The_Final_Frontier \"Star Trek V: The Final\nFrontier\")_ and _[Field of Dreams](/wiki/Field_of_Dreams \"Field of Dreams\")_.\nWriting for _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York\nTimes\")_ , Caryn James felt the combination in these films reflected [New\nAge](/wiki/New_Age \"New Age\") concerns, where the worship of God was equated\nto searching for fathers. James felt that neither Indiana or his father is\npreoccupied with finding the Grail or defeating the evil Nazis, but that,\nrather, both seek professional respect for one another in their [boys'\nown](/wiki/Boy%27s_Own_Paper \"Boy's Own Paper\") adventure. James contrasted\nthe temple's biblically epic destruction with the more effective and quiet\nconversation between the Joneses at the film's end. James noted that Indiana's\nmother does not appear in the prologue, being portrayed as already having died\nbefore the film's events began.[26]\n\n## Cultural\nreferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Cultural references\")]\n\nThe 1912 prologue refers to events in the lives of Indiana's creators. When\nIndiana cracks the bullwhip to defend himself against a lion, he accidentally\nlashes and scars his chin. Ford gained this scar in a car accident as a young\nman.[4] Indiana taking his nickname from his pet [Alaskan\nMalamute](/wiki/Alaskan_Malamute \"Alaskan Malamute\") is a reference to the\ncharacter being named after Lucas's dog.[21] The train carriage Indiana enters\nis named \"Doctor Fantasy's Magic Caboose\", which was the name producer [Frank\nMarshall](/wiki/Frank_Marshall_\\(film_producer\\) \"Frank Marshall \\(film\nproducer\\)\") used when performing magic tricks. Spielberg suggested the idea,\nMarshall came up with the false-bottomed box through which Indiana\nescapes,[27] and production designer Elliott Scott suggested the trick be done\nin a single, uninterrupted shot.[20] Spielberg intended the shot of Henry with\nhis umbrella—after he causes the bird strike on the German plane—to evoke\n_[Ryan's Daughter](/wiki/Ryan%27s_Daughter \"Ryan's Daughter\")_.[21]\n\n##\nRelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Release\")]\n\n###\nMarketing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Marketing\")]\n\nSee also: [Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\n(soundtrack)](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Indiana\nJones and the Last Crusade \\(soundtrack\\)\")\n\nThe film's [teaser trailer](/wiki/Teaser_trailer \"Teaser trailer\") debuted in\nNovember 1988 with _[Scrooged](/wiki/Scrooged \"Scrooged\")_ and _[The Naked\nGun](/wiki/The_Naked_Gun:_From_the_Files_of_Police_Squad! \"The Naked Gun: From\nthe Files of Police Squad!\")_.[28] Rob MacGregor wrote the [tie-in](/wiki/Tie-\nin \"Tie-in\") novelization that was released in June 1989;[29] it sold enough\ncopies to be included on the [_New York Times_ Best Seller\nlist](/wiki/New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list \"New York Times Best Seller\nlist\").[30] MacGregor went on to write the first six [_Indiana Jones_ prequel\nnovels](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_\\(franchise\\)#Adult_novels \"Indiana Jones\n\\(franchise\\)\") during the 1990s.

Although he praised Ford and Connery, he felt the film's\nexploration of Indiana's character took away his mystery and that Spielberg\nshould not have tried to mature his storytelling.[40] Two days later, [Desson\nThomson](/wiki/Desson_Thomson \"Desson Thomson\") published a positive review\npraising the film's adventure and action, as well as the father–son\nrelationship's thematic depth.[41] [Joseph\nMcBride](/wiki/Joseph_McBride_\\(writer\\) \"Joseph McBride \\(writer\\)\") of\n_[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_ observed the\n\"Cartoonlike Nazi villains of _Raiders_ have been replaced by more genuinely\nfrightening Nazis led by Julian Glover and Michael Byrne,\" and found the\nmoment where Indiana meets Hitler \"chilling\".[42] In his biography of\nSpielberg, McBride added the film was less \"racist\" than its predecessors.[7]\n\n[Peter Travers](/wiki/Peter_Travers \"Peter Travers\") of _[Rolling\nStone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone_\\(magazine\\) \"Rolling Stone \\(magazine\\)\")_ said\nthe film was \"the wildest and wittiest Indy of them all\".

Canby believed that while the film did not\nmatch the previous two in its pacing, it still had \"hilariously off-the-wall\nsequences\" such as the circus train chase. He also said that Spielberg was\nmaturing by focusing on the father–son relationship,[43] a call echoed by\nMcBride in _Variety_.[42] [Roger Ebert](/wiki/Roger_Ebert \"Roger Ebert\")\npraised the scene depicting Indiana as a [Boy Scout](/wiki/Boy_Scout \"Boy\nScout\") with the Cross of Coronado; he compared it to the \"style of\nillustration that appeared in the boys' adventure magazines of the 1940s\",\nsaying that Spielberg \"must have been paging through his old issues of _[Boys'\nLife](/wiki/Boys%27_Life \"Boys' Life\")_ magazine... the feeling that you can\nstumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout\ntroop.

A fitting end to the original\ntrilogy, _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ captures some of the sense of\nfun that infused the first movie while using the addition of Sean Connery to\nup the comedic ante and provide a father/son dynamic.\"[45] Neil Smith of the\n[BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\") praised the action, but said the drama and comedy\nbetween the Joneses was more memorable.
