One of the first great players to join the Celtics was [Bob\nCousy](/wiki/Bob_Cousy \"Bob Cousy\"), whom Auerbach initially refused to draft\nout of nearby Holy Cross because he was \"too flashy\".[10] Cousy eventually\nbecame the property of the [Chicago Stags](/wiki/Chicago_Stags \"Chicago\nStags\"),[11] but when that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics\nin a dispersal draft. After the [1955–56](/wiki/1955%E2%80%9356_NBA_season\n\"1955–56 NBA season\") season, Auerbach made a stunning trade. He sent\nperennial All-Star [Ed Macauley](/wiki/Ed_Macauley \"Ed Macauley\") to the [St.\nLouis Hawks](/wiki/St._Louis_Hawks \"St. Louis Hawks\") along with the draft\nrights to [Cliff Hagan](/wiki/Cliff_Hagan \"Cliff Hagan\") in exchange for the\nsecond overall pick in the draft.[12] After negotiating with the [Rochester\nRoyals](/wiki/Rochester_Royals \"Rochester Royals\")—a negotiation that included\na promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after [Ice\nCapades](/wiki/Ice_Capades \"Ice Capades\") to Rochester if the Royals would let\nRussell slide to #2—Auerbach used the pick to select [University of San\nFrancisco](/wiki/University_of_San_Francisco \"University of San Francisco\")\n[center](/wiki/Center_\\(basketball\\) \"Center \\(basketball\\)\") [Bill\nRussell](/wiki/Bill_Russell \"Bill Russell\").[13] Auerbach also acquired Holy\nCross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, [Tommy\nHeinsohn](/wiki/Tommy_Heinsohn \"Tommy Heinsohn\").[14] Russell and Heinsohn\nworked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom\nAuerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade.[14]\n\n### 1957–1969: The Bill Russell\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Boston_Celtics&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: 1957–1969: The Bill Russell era\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Bill_russell_dribbling.jpg/200px-\nBill_russell_dribbling.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bill_russell_dribbling.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bill_russell_dribbling.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Bill Russell](/wiki/Bill_Russell \"Bill Russell\") played 13 years for the\nteam, winning 11 NBA titles.\n\nWith [Bill Russell](/wiki/Bill_Russell \"Bill Russell\"), the Celtics advanced\nto the [1957 NBA Finals](/wiki/1957_NBA_Finals \"1957 NBA Finals\") and defeated\nthe St. Louis Hawks in seven games, giving the Celtics the first of their\nrecord 17 championships. Russell went on to win 11 championships, making him\nthe most decorated player in NBA history.[15] In 1958, the Celtics again\nadvanced to the [NBA Finals](/wiki/1958_NBA_Finals \"1958 NBA Finals\"), this\ntime losing to the Hawks in 6 games.[16] However, with the acquisition of\n[K.C. Jones](/wiki/K.C._Jones \"K.C. Jones\") that year, the Celtics began a\ndynasty that would last for more than a decade.[17] In 1959, the Celtics won\nthe NBA Championship after sweeping the [Minneapolis\nLakers](/wiki/Minneapolis_Lakers \"Minneapolis Lakers\"), the first of their\nrecord eight consecutive championships.[18] During that time, the Celtics met\nthe Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter\nrivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first\nNBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26,\n1964, [Willie Naulls](/wiki/Willie_Naulls \"Willie Naulls\") replaced an injured\nTommy Heinsohn, joining [Tom 'Satch' Sanders](/wiki/Satch_Sanders \"Satch\nSanders\"), K.C. Jones, [Sam Jones](/wiki/Sam_Jones_\\(basketball\\) \"Sam Jones\n\\(basketball\\)\"), and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics\ndefeated St. Louis 97–84. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in\nplace of Heinsohn.[19] The Celtics of the late-1950s–1960s are widely\nconsidered as one of the most dominant teams of all time.[20]\n\nAuerbach retired as coach after the 1965–66 season and Russell took over as\nplayer-coach, which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested.[21] With\nhis appointment, Russell also became the first African-American coach in any\nU.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would\nhold well into the 1980s. However, that year the Celtics' string of NBA titles\nwas broken as they lost to the [Philadelphia 76ers](/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers\n\"Philadelphia 76ers\") in the Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed\ntwo more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the [Los Angeles\nLakers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers \"Los Angeles Lakers\") each time in the NBA\nFinals.[22] Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a\ndominant Celtics dynasty that had garnered 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.[23]\nThe streak of 8 consecutive championships is the longest streak of consecutive\nchampionships in U.S. professional sports history.[24]\n\n### 1970–1978: Heinsohn and Cowens\nduo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Boston_Celtics&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: 1970–1978: Heinsohn and Cowens duo\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Tom_heinsohn_Celt.JPG/220px-\nTom_heinsohn_Celt.JPG)](/wiki/File:Tom_heinsohn_Celt.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tom_heinsohn_Celt.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Tom Heinsohn](/wiki/Tom_Heinsohn \"Tom Heinsohn\") coached the Boston Celtics\nto the 1974 and 1976 NBA Championship.\n\n[![Portrait photograph of white man wearing white and green\ntop.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Dave_Cowens_-_2005_NBA_Legends_Tour_-_1-21-05.jpg/170px-\nDave_Cowens_-_2005_NBA_Legends_Tour_-_1-21-05.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dave_Cowens_-_2005_NBA_Legends_Tour_-_1-21-05.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dave_Cowens_-_2005_NBA_Legends_Tour_-_1-21-05.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Dave Cowens](/wiki/Dave_Cowens \"Dave Cowens\") had helped the Celtics win 2\ntitles during the mid-1970s.\n\nThe 1970 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing\nrecord since the [1949–50](/wiki/1949%E2%80%9350_NBA_season \"1949–50 NBA\nseason\") season. However, with the acquisition of [Dave\nCowens](/wiki/Dave_Cowens \"Dave Cowens\"), [Paul Silas](/wiki/Paul_Silas \"Paul\nSilas\"), and [Jo Jo White](/wiki/Jo_Jo_White \"Jo Jo White\"), the Celtics soon\nbecame dominant again.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals\nin 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an\nexcellent 68–14 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment,\nas they were upset in 7 games by the [New York Knicks](/wiki/New_York_Knicks\n\"New York Knicks\") in the Conference Finals. [John\nHavlicek](/wiki/John_Havlicek \"John Havlicek\") injured his right shoulder in\ngame six and was forced to play game 7 shooting left handed.[25] The Celtics\nreturned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the [Milwaukee\nBucks](/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks \"Milwaukee Bucks\") in the [NBA Finals in\n1974](/wiki/1974_NBA_Finals \"1974 NBA Finals\") for their 12th [NBA\nChampionship](/wiki/NBA_Championship \"NBA Championship\").[26] The teams split\nthe first four games, and after the Celtics won Game 5 in Milwaukee they\nheaded back to Boston leading 3 games to 2, with a chance to claim the title\non their home court. However, the Bucks won Game 6 when [Kareem Abdul-\nJabbar](/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar \"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\") nestled in a hook\nshot with 3 seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series\nreturned to Milwaukee. But Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points,\nas the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five\nyears. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the [Phoenix\nSuns](/wiki/Phoenix_Suns \"Phoenix Suns\") in 6 games. The Finals featured one\nof the greatest games in the NBA's history. With the series tied at two games\napiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force\novertime. In double overtime, a [Gar Heard](/wiki/Gar_Heard \"Gar Heard\") turn-\naround jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at\nwhich point the Celtics prevailed.[27] [Tommy Heinsohn](/wiki/Tommy_Heinsohn\n\"Tommy Heinsohn\") coached the team for those two championships. After the 1976\nchampionship and a [playoff appearance in 1977](/wiki/1977_NBA_Playoffs \"1977\nNBA Playoffs\"), Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the [1977 NBA\ndraft](/wiki/1977_NBA_draft \"1977 NBA draft\"), the Celtics drafted a young\nforward from [UNC Charlotte](/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Charlotte\n\"University of North Carolina at Charlotte\") named [Cedric\nMaxwell](/wiki/Cedric_Maxwell \"Cedric Maxwell\").[28] \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did\nnot contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's\njob became even tougher following the [1977–78\nseason](/wiki/1977%E2%80%9378_NBA_season \"1977–78 NBA season\") in which they\nwent 32–50 as [John Havlicek](/wiki/John_Havlicek \"John Havlicek\"), the\nCeltics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### 1979–1992: The Larry Bird\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Boston_Celtics&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: 1979–1992: The Larry Bird era\")]\n\nThe Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the [1978 NBA\ndraft](/wiki/1978_NBA_draft \"1978 NBA draft\").[29] Since the Celtics had two\ndraft choices, Auerbach took a risk and selected junior [Larry\nBird](/wiki/Larry_Bird \"Larry Bird\") of [Indiana State](/wiki/Indiana_State\n\"Indiana State\") with the 6th pick, knowing Bird would elect to remain in\ncollege for his senior year. The Celtics would retain his rights for one\nyear—a rule that was later changed—and Auerbach believed Bird's potential\nwould make it worth the wait. Auerbach also felt that when the college season\nended the Celtics would have a great chance to sign Bird. Auerbach was right\nand Bird signed soon after leading Indiana State to the NCAA Championship\ngame, where they fell to a [Michigan State\nUniversity](/wiki/Michigan_State_University \"Michigan State University\") team.\n(The other pick was [Freeman Williams](/wiki/Freeman_Williams \"Freeman\nWilliams\"), who was traded before the 1978–79 season began.)\n\nIn 1978, ownership was changed as [Irv Levin](/wiki/Irv_Levin \"Irv Levin\")\ntraded his stake in the Celtics with [John Y. Brown,\nJr.](/wiki/John_Y._Brown,_Jr. \"John Y. Brown, Jr.\")'s [Buffalo\nBraves](/wiki/Buffalo_Braves \"Buffalo Braves\"), so he could move the Braves to\nCalifornia, where they became known as the [San Diego\nClippers](/wiki/San_Diego_Clippers \"San Diego Clippers\"). As part of the deal,\ntrades were made between the Braves/Clippers franchise and the Celtics\nfranchise which resulted in many former Braves joining the team.[30] One of\nthe moves that irked Auerbach was a trade Brown made with the Braves that saw\nhis franchise center [Bob McAdoo](/wiki/Bob_McAdoo \"Bob McAdoo\") join the\nCeltics for three first round draft picks Auerbach had planned on using for\nthe future rebuilding project he was trying to undertake.[31] The dispute\nnearly led to Auerbach resigning as general manager for a position with the\nNew York Knicks. With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the\nteam to [Harry Mangurian](/wiki/Harry_Mangurian \"Harry Mangurian\") rather than\nrun the risk of having Auerbach leave the team.[32] The Celtics would struggle\nthrough the season, going 29–53 without Bird.[33] Newcomers [Chris\nFord](/wiki/Chris_Ford \"Chris Ford\"), [Rick Robey](/wiki/Rick_Robey \"Rick\nRobey\"), [Cedric Maxwell](/wiki/Cedric_Maxwell \"Cedric Maxwell\") and [Nate\nArchibald](/wiki/Nate_Archibald \"Nate Archibald\") failed to reverse the team's\nmomentum.[34]\n\nBird debuted for the Celtics during the\n[1979–80](/wiki/1979%E2%80%9380_NBA_season \"1979–80 NBA season\") season, a\nyear after being drafted.[35] With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a\nnumber of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost\nimmediately traded McAdoo,[36] a former NBA scoring champion, to the [Detroit\nPistons](/wiki/Detroit_Pistons \"Detroit Pistons\") for\n[guard](/wiki/Guard_\\(basketball\\) \"Guard \\(basketball\\)\") [M. L.\nCarr](/wiki/M._L._Carr \"M. L. Carr\"), a defensive specialist, and two first-\nround picks in the [1980 NBA draft](/wiki/1980_NBA_draft \"1980 NBA\ndraft\").[32] He also picked up [point guard](/wiki/Point_guard \"Point guard\")\n[Gerald Henderson](/wiki/Gerald_Henderson \"Gerald Henderson\") from the\n[CBA](/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association \"Continental Basketball\nAssociation\"). Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent\nbackcourt, with their unique skills blending in perfectly with the talented\nfrontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird, who would go on to win [NBA Rookie of\nthe Year](/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year \"NBA Rookie of the Year\") honors.[37]\nThe Celtics improved by 32 games, which at the time was the best single-season\nturnaround in NBA history, going 61–21 and losing to the Philadelphia 76ers in\nthe Eastern Conference Finals. That record was later broken by the Celtics\nabout 30 years later.[38]\n\nAfter the season, Auerbach completed what may be the most lopsided trade in\nNBA history. Auerbach had always been a fan of stockpiling draft picks, so\neven after the success of the 1979–80 season, the Celtics had both the 1st and\n13th picks in the [1980 NBA draft](/wiki/1980_NBA_draft \"1980 NBA draft\") left\nover from the [M. L. Carr](/wiki/M._L._Carr \"M. L. Carr\") trade. Auerbach saw\nan opportunity to improve the team immediately, sending the two picks to the\n[Golden State Warriors](/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors \"Golden State Warriors\")\nin exchange for [center](/wiki/Center_\\(basketball\\) \"Center \\(basketball\\)\")\n[Robert Parish](/wiki/Robert_Parish \"Robert Parish\")[39] and the Warriors'\nfirst round pick, the 3rd overall. With the draft pick, Auerbach picked\n[University of Minnesota](/wiki/University_of_Minnesota \"University of\nMinnesota\") [power forward](/wiki/Power_forward_\\(basketball\\) \"Power forward\n\\(basketball\\)\") [Kevin McHale](/wiki/Kevin_McHale_\\(basketball\\) \"Kevin\nMcHale \\(basketball\\)\").[40] With these three future Hall of Famers on the\nteam, henceforth known as the first 'Big 3', the Celtics had a core in place\nto again become a dominant team.\n\nThe Celtics went 62–20 under coach [Bill Fitch](/wiki/Bill_Fitch \"Bill Fitch\")\nin [1980–81](/wiki/1980%E2%80%9381_NBA_season \"1980–81 NBA season\"),[41]\ndespite losing [center](/wiki/Center_\\(basketball\\) \"Center \\(basketball\\)\")\n[Dave Cowens](/wiki/Dave_Cowens \"Dave Cowens\") to retirement late in training\ncamp. Once again the Celtics matched up with the 76ers in the Eastern\nConference Finals. Boston fell behind 3 games to 1 before coming back to win a\nclassic 7th game, 91–90. The Celtics went on to capture the 1981 NBA\nChampionship over the [Houston Rockets](/wiki/Houston_Rockets \"Houston\nRockets\"),[42] just two years after Bird had been drafted. Maxwell was named\n[NBA Finals MVP](/wiki/NBA_Finals_MVP \"NBA Finals MVP\").[43] [The following\nyear](/wiki/1981%E2%80%9382_NBA_season \"1981–82 NBA season\") the Celtics again\ntried to come back from a 3–1 deficit against the Sixers in the rematch but\nthis time lost Game 7 at Boston Garden.[44] In\n[1983](/wiki/1982%E2%80%9383_NBA_season \"1982–83 NBA season\") the Celtics were\nswept in the playoffs for the first time by the Milwaukee Bucks;[45]\nafterwards Fitch resigned and the team was sold to new owners led by [Don\nGaston](/wiki/Don_Gaston \"Don Gaston\").[46]\n\nIn [1983–84](/wiki/1983%E2%80%9384_NBA_season \"1983–84 NBA season\") the\nCeltics, under new coach [K. C. Jones](/wiki/K._C._Jones \"K. C. Jones\"), would\ngo 62–20 and finally get back to the [NBA Finals](/wiki/1984_NBA_Finals \"1984\nNBA Finals\") after a three-year hiatus.[47] In the finals, the Celtics came\nback from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Lakers, winning their 15th\nchampionship.[48] Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star [Magic\nJohnson](/wiki/Magic_Johnson \"Magic Johnson\") during this series. After the\nseries Auerbach officially retired as general manager but maintained the\nposition of team President.[49] Auerbach was succeeded by [Jan\nVolk](/wiki/Jan_Volk \"Jan Volk\") as general manager.[49] Volk had been with\nthe Celtics since graduating from [Columbia Law\nSchool](/wiki/Columbia_Law_School \"Columbia Law School\") in 1971 and had been\nthe team's [General Counsel](/wiki/General_Counsel \"General Counsel\") since\n1976 and the team's Assistant G.M. since 1980. During the off-season, in\nVolk's first major transaction since assuming the GM role, the Celtics traded\nHenderson to the [Seattle SuperSonics](/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics \"Seattle\nSuperSonics\") for their first round pick in the [1986 NBA\ndraft](/wiki/1986_NBA_draft \"1986 NBA draft\").\n\nIn 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again, but this time the Lakers took the\nchampionship.[50] This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics\nfor a championship, as well as the only time the Celtics lost a championship\nat Boston Garden. During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired [Bill\nWalton](/wiki/Bill_Walton \"Bill Walton\") from the [Los Angeles\nClippers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers \"Los Angeles Clippers\") in exchange for\n[Cedric Maxwell](/wiki/Cedric_Maxwell \"Cedric Maxwell\").[51] Walton was a big\nstar with the [Portland Trail Blazers](/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers \"Portland\nTrail Blazers\"), but injuries had kept him from living up to expectations. He\nwas willing to come off the bench, deferring to the three big men already with\nthe team. Walton, considered the best passer of all NBA centers in history,\nstayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Dennis_Johnson_Lipofsky.jpg/220px-\nDennis_Johnson_Lipofsky.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dennis_Johnson_Lipofsky.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dennis_Johnson_Lipofsky.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Dennis Johnson](/wiki/Dennis_Johnson \"Dennis Johnson\") was another key member\nof the Celtics, along with the \"Big 3\".\n\nIn [1985–86](/wiki/1985%E2%80%9386_NBA_season \"1985–86 NBA season\") the\nCeltics fielded one of the best teams in NBA history. The 1986 Celtics won 67\ngames, going 40–1 at their home games. Bird won his third consecutive MVP\naward and Walton won the [Sixth Man of the Year\nAward](/wiki/Sixth_Man_of_the_Year_Award \"Sixth Man of the Year Award\"). They\nwon the franchise's 16th championship and last of the 20th century, defeating\nthe Houston Rockets in the [NBA Finals](/wiki/1986_NBA_Finals \"1986 NBA\nFinals\") 4 games to 2.\n\nThanks to the 1984 trade of [Gerald Henderson](/wiki/Gerald_Henderson \"Gerald\nHenderson\") and the subsequent fall of the Seattle SuperSonics, at the end of\nthe [1985–86](/wiki/1985%E2%80%9386_NBA_season \"1985–86 NBA season\") the\nCeltics owned not only the best team in the NBA but also the second pick in\nthe [1986 NBA draft](/wiki/1986_NBA_draft \"1986 NBA draft\"). The Celtics\ndrafted [Len Bias](/wiki/Len_Bias \"Len Bias\") with the pick and had high hopes\nfor the young [University of\nMaryland](/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park \"University of Maryland,\nCollege Park\") star.[52] Fans believed Bias had superstar potential, and that\nhe would be the perfect complement to the aging, but still strong, Celtics.\nThe hope was his presence would ensure the franchise would remain a powerhouse\nafter Bird, McHale and Parish retired. Unfortunately, Bias died 48 hours after\nhe was drafted, after using cocaine at a party and overdosing.[53] It would be\nthe first in a long string of bad luck for the Celtics, one that would\ncontinue until the next manifestation of the 'Big Three' in Boston. Despite\nthe loss of Bias, the Celtics remained competitive in\n[1986–87](/wiki/1986%E2%80%9387_NBA_season \"1986–87 NBA season\"), going 59–23\nand again winning the Eastern Conference Championship.[54] However, injuries\ntook their toll, and the Celtics ceded the NBA championship to the Lakers in\nsix games. It would be 21 years before they would reach the NBA Finals again.\nThe Celtics' reign as the Eastern Conference champions ended in 1988, after\nthe team lost to the Detroit Pistons in six games.[55]\n\nAfter the 1987–88 season, head coach [K.C. Jones](/wiki/K.C._Jones \"K.C.\nJones\") retired. Jones was replaced as head coach by assistant [Jimmy\nRodgers](/wiki/Jimmy_Rodgers_\\(basketball\\) \"Jimmy Rodgers \\(basketball\\)\").\nRodgers faced immediate trouble in [1988–89](/wiki/1988%E2%80%9389_NBA_season\n\"1988–89 NBA season\") when, only 6 games into the season, Larry Bird decided\nto have surgery to remove bone spurs in his feet. The injury sidelined Bird\nuntil well after the All-Star Break, although he hoped to return that year.\nHowever, despite his best attempts to return he was unable to make it back as\nthe Celtics stumbled to a 42–40 record and a first round playoff defeat to the\nDetroit Pistons. Bird returned in [1989–90](/wiki/1989%E2%80%9390_NBA_season\n\"1989–90 NBA season\") and led the Celtics to a 52–30 record. In the\n[playoffs](/wiki/1990_NBA_Playoffs \"1990 NBA Playoffs\"), after winning the\nfirst two games of a Best of 5 series against the New York Knicks, the Celtics\ncollapsed, losing 3 straight, including the decisive 5th game at the [Boston\nGarden](/wiki/Boston_Garden \"Boston Garden\"). In the wake of the embarrassing\ndefeat, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach and former Celtics'\nplayer [Chris Ford](/wiki/Chris_Ford \"Chris Ford\").\n\nUnder Ford's leadership the Celtics improved to 56–26 in\n[1990–91](/wiki/1990%E2%80%9391_NBA_season \"1990–91 NBA season\"), recapturing\nthe Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with a variety of\ninjuries. The Celtics fell to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference\nSemifinals. In 1992, a late season rally allowed the Celtics to catch the New\nYork Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. The team finished 51–31\nand matched up with the [Indiana Pacers](/wiki/Indiana_Pacers \"Indiana\nPacers\") in the First round, this time sweeping the series. In the Eastern\nConference Semifinals the Celtics lost a grueling 7 game series to the\n[Cleveland Cavaliers](/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers \"Cleveland Cavaliers\"). Due to\nback problems, Larry Bird played in only 45 of the 82 regular season games,\nand only 4 of the 10 playoff games; during games he was frequently lying on\nthe floor when out of the lineup, instead of sitting on the bench. After 13\nseasons with the club and winning a gold medal in the [Barcelona\nOlympics](/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics \"1992 Summer Olympics\") with the [Dream\nTeam](/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_basketball_team \"United States\nmen's national basketball team\"), Bird retired in 1992, primarily due to his\nback injuries. Among his lasting contributions to the game was the \"Bird\nexception\", which allows teams to exceed the salary cap to re-sign their own\nfree agents, at an amount up to the maximum salary.\n\n### 1993–1998:\nRebuilding[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Boston_Celtics&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: 1993–1998: Rebuilding\")]\n\nAt the time of Bird's retirement, former Celtics\n[guard](/wiki/Guard_\\(basketball\\) \"Guard \\(basketball\\)\") [Chris\nFord](/wiki/Chris_Ford \"Chris Ford\") was the coach of the Celtics.[56]\n26-year-old [Reggie Lewis](/wiki/Reggie_Lewis \"Reggie Lewis\") (out of Boston's\n[Northeastern University](/wiki/Northeastern_University_\\(Boston\\)\n\"Northeastern University \\(Boston\\)\")) was seen as Bird's successor as the\nfranchise player for the Celtics. Lewis, a [small forward](/wiki/Small_forward\n\"Small forward\"), fainted during a [1993 first round\nplayoff](/wiki/1993_NBA_Playoffs \"1993 NBA Playoffs\") matchup with the\n[Charlotte Hornets](/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets \"Charlotte Hornets\") which the\nCeltics lost in four games.[57] It was later revealed that Lewis had heart\nproblems,[58] yet he was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. He\ndied of a heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University during\nthe offseason.[59] The Celtics honored his memory during the following season\nby retiring his number 35.[60] The original Big 3 era came to an end in 1994,\nafter Robert Parish signed with the Hornets[39] The year before, Kevin McHale\nretired after the Celtics' playoff loss to the Hornets. The Celtics finished\nthe year out of the playoffs with a 32–50 mark.\n\nIn 1994, the Celtics hired former player and legendary towel-waving Celtic\ncheerleader [M. L. Carr](/wiki/M._L._Carr \"M. L. Carr\") to be the team's new\nV.P. of Basketball Operations, working alongside G.M. Jan Volk. In his first\n[draft](/wiki/1994_NBA_draft \"1994 NBA draft\") in charge of the Celtics, he\ndrafted [University of North\nCarolina](/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill \"University of\nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill\") star [Eric Montross](/wiki/Eric_Montross \"Eric\nMontross\") with his first round draft pick. Montross became the new heir\napparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded.\n[1994–95](/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_NBA_season \"1994–95 NBA season\") was the\nCeltics' final season in the [Boston Garden](/wiki/Boston_Garden \"Boston\nGarden\"). The Celtics signed the aging [Dominique\nWilkins](/wiki/Dominique_Wilkins \"Dominique Wilkins\") as a free agent, and he\nled the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player [Dino\nRađa](/wiki/Dino_Ra%C4%91a \"Dino Rađa\"), a power forward from\n[Croatia](/wiki/Croatia \"Croatia\"), added an interior presence to the team\nthat had been lacking in [1993–94](/wiki/1993%E2%80%9394_NBA_season \"1993–94\nNBA season\"). The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored\n[Orlando Magic](/wiki/Orlando_Magic \"Orlando Magic\") in 4 games. In 1995, the\nCeltics moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth,\nthen [TD Garden](/wiki/TD_Garden \"TD Garden\")). Carr fired [Chris\nFord](/wiki/Chris_Ford \"Chris Ford\") and took the coaching reins himself.\nAfter drafting [Providence College](/wiki/Providence_College \"Providence\nCollege\") star [Eric\nWilliams](/w/index.php?title=Eric_Williams_\\(basketball,_born_1872\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Eric Williams \\(basketball, born 1872\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\"), the\nCeltics struggled to a 33–49 record.\n\nThings got worse in [1996–97](/wiki/1996%E2%80%9397_NBA_season \"1996–97 NBA\nseason\") as the Celtics lost a franchise record 67 games, setting an unwanted\n[NBA record](/wiki/Imperfect_season \"Imperfect season\") winning only once\nagainst other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall\ndespite the emergence of 1st-round draft pick [Antoine\nWalker](/wiki/Antoine_Walker \"Antoine Walker\"). With Carr's coaching stint\ndeemed a failure, he stepped aside to another job in the organization when\nowner Paul Gaston convinced star college coach [Rick Pitino](/wiki/Rick_Pitino\n\"Rick Pitino\") to join the franchise as the team's president, director of\nbasketball operations, and [head coach](/wiki/Head_coach \"Head coach\").[61]\nPitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, who had\nfilled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about this change from\nlocal media people. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior\neveryone expected him to be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out\nwith dignity, even as the team failed to improve.\n\nThe Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the [1997 NBA\ndraft](/wiki/1997_NBA_draft \"1997 NBA draft\"),[62] and used the picks to\nselect a brand new backcourt through [Chauncey Billups](/wiki/Chauncey_Billups\n\"Chauncey Billups\") and [Ron Mercer](/wiki/Ron_Mercer \"Ron Mercer\").

After the\nseason Walker was traded again, this time to the [Miami Heat](/wiki/Miami_Heat\n\"Miami Heat\"). Despite Pierce's career season, in which he averaged career-\nhighs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33–49 record,\nowing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the\nlikes of [Marcus Banks](/wiki/Marcus_Banks \"Marcus Banks\"), [Ricky\nDavis](/wiki/Ricky_Davis \"Ricky Davis\") and [Mark Blount](/wiki/Mark_Blount\n\"Mark Blount\") traded for underachieving former first-overall pick [Michael\nOlowokandi](/wiki/Michael_Olowokandi \"Michael Olowokandi\") and former all-star\n[Wally Szczerbiak](/wiki/Wally_Szczerbiak \"Wally Szczerbiak\").\n\nThe Celtics continued to rebuild in the [2006 NBA draft](/wiki/2006_NBA_draft\n\"2006 NBA draft\").

The new 'Big Three' of Pierce, Allen and Garnett went 66–16 in the\nregular season, a 42-game improvement. However, the team struggled initially\nin the playoffs. The Atlanta Hawks took them to seven games in the first\nround, as did the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The\nCeltics defeated the Detroit Pistons in six games of the Eastern Conference\nFinals, winning two road games.[86]\n\nIn the 2008 NBA Finals, the Celtics faced MVP [Kobe Bryant](/wiki/Kobe_Bryant\n\"Kobe Bryant\") and the Los Angeles Lakers for the 11th time, the first time\nsince 1987. The Celtics won Game 1 at home 98–88, fueled by strong play by\nGarnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second half knee injury. They\nwould also go on to win Game 2 108–102, despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead\nin the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers\nstifled Pierce and Garnett in Game 3 and won 87–81. However, the Celtics would\novercome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97–91, the largest comeback in\nNBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to\nwin Game 5 103–98, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics\noverpowered the Lakers, winning 131–92, clinching their 17th NBA title, and\nfirst since 1986.

Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009\nCeltics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end\nagainst the Magic in the second round, losing in seven games after leading\n3–2, the first such occurrence in team history.[91] In the prior round they\nwere pushed to a Game 7 against the [Chicago Bulls](/wiki/Chicago_Bulls\n\"Chicago Bulls\"), with four of those games went to overtime, yet the Celtics'\nexperience was too much for the young Bulls.[92]\n\nThe following year, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions\nof [Rasheed Wallace](/wiki/Rasheed_Wallace \"Rasheed Wallace\") and [Marquis\nDaniels](/wiki/Marquis_Daniels \"Marquis Daniels\"), the Celtics started the\nseason 23–5 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However, Doc\nRivers decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the\nplayoffs. As a result, the Celtics sputtered to an even 27–27 record the rest\nof the way and finished the 2009–10 regular season with a 50–32 record, with a\nbetter road (26–15) than home (24–17) record.[93] Despite previous predictions\nthe Celtics would never go deeper into the playoffs, the Celtics still managed\nto make the [NBA Finals](/wiki/NBA_Finals \"NBA Finals\") despite their lowly\nfourth seeding. They defeated the Miami Heat in five games, upset the top-\nseeded Cavaliers in six games and toppled the defending Eastern champion\nMagic, avenging their loss from the previous season. Rajon Rondo emerged as a\nbonafide superstar during post-season play, continuing his rise to fame\nbeginning with his first All-Star appearance.[94] For the 12th time, the\nadversary were the Lakers. After taking a 3–2 lead heading into Los Angeles\nfor Game 6, the Celtics appeared poised to pack in their 18th title. But\n[Kendrick Perkins](/wiki/Kendrick_Perkins \"Kendrick Perkins\"), the team's\nstarting center, suffered a severe knee injury early in Game 6,[95] and the\nCeltics would lose Game 6, and go on to blow a 13-point lead in Game 7. After\nspeculation coach [Doc Rivers](/wiki/Doc_Rivers \"Doc Rivers\") would resign to\nspend more time with his family, he affirmed on June 30, 2010, that he would\nreturn to the team for the 2010–11 season.\n\nDuring the 2010 off season, with Perkins expected to be out until February\n2011, the Celtics signed two former All-Star centers, [Shaquille\nO'Neal](/wiki/Shaquille_O%27Neal \"Shaquille O'Neal\") and [Jermaine\nO'Neal](/wiki/Jermaine_O%27Neal \"Jermaine O'Neal\"), along with\n[Turkish](/wiki/Turkey \"Turkey\") center [Semih Erden](/wiki/Semih_Erden \"Semih\nErden\"), their [2008 second round pick](/wiki/2008_NBA_draft \"2008 NBA\ndraft\"), and the return of [Delonte West](/wiki/Delonte_West \"Delonte West\").\nShaquille O'Neal's presence wound up leading to Perkins departure: the Celtics\nwere 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[96] with\na 19–3 record with O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[97] Consequently, Perkins\nwas traded to the [Oklahoma City Thunder](/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder\n\"Oklahoma City Thunder\") in February, when the Celtics were 41–14 and held the\nEastern Conference leaderboard despite another rash of injuries. Following the\ntrade, however, they proceeded to win only 15 of their final 27 games to\nfinish with a 56–26 record, sliding to the third seed, due to the injuries –\nO'Neal played only five minutes – and difficult adjustment of new Celtics such\nas [Jeff Green](/wiki/Jeff_Green_\\(basketball\\) \"Jeff Green \\(basketball\\)\"),\n[Nenad Krstić](/wiki/Nenad_Krsti%C4%87 \"Nenad Krstić\") and [Carlos\nArroyo](/wiki/Carlos_Arroyo \"Carlos Arroyo\").[96][98] The 2010–11 season still\nprovided three landmarks: the Celtics became the second team to reach 3,000\nvictories, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points after\nLarry Bird and John Havlicek, and Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most\nthree-pointers made in a career. The [2011 NBA\nPlayoffs](/wiki/2011_NBA_Playoffs \"2011 NBA Playoffs\") started with the\nCeltics sweeping the New York Knicks 4–0 in the opening round, but in the\nsecond round they were ousted by eventual Eastern champions Miami Heat in five\ngames.

The struggles let to the longest losing streak in the 'Big Three' era\nwith five games, and by the All Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a\n15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams after the break,\ngoing 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their 5th division title in a\nrow. The Celtics would end up making the playoffs as the fourth seed in the\nEastern Conference in the 2012 NBA Playoffs.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Celtics faced the [Atlanta Hawks](/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks\n\"Atlanta Hawks\") in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong\nplay from Pierce and Garnett. In the Conference Semifinals the Celtics faced\nthe Philadelphia 76ers led by [Doug Collins](/wiki/Doug_Collins_\\(basketball\\)\n\"Doug Collins \\(basketball\\)\") and a young group of promising players that\nwould push the Celtics into a full-seven game series. Following a Game 7 85–75\nwin the Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, who had\ndefeated them in the playoffs the previous year. After losing the first two\ngames in Miami, Boston fought back and won the next three games. With the\npossibility of closing the series at home, the C suffered a blowout loss at\nthe TD Garden of 98–79, taking the series back to Miami for Game 7, where the\nCeltics built an early lead but eventually lost 101–88; Miami would go on to\ndefeat the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Finals.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Rajon_Rondo_Media_Day.jpg/220px-\nRajon_Rondo_Media_Day.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rajon_Rondo_Media_Day.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rajon_Rondo_Media_Day.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Rajon Rondo](/wiki/Rajon_Rondo \"Rajon Rondo\") became the Celtics' leader\nafter the 'Big Three' left.\n\nThe 2012 offseason started with the Celtics having only six players under\ncontract. While Kevin Garnett renewed, Ray Allen chose to sign with the Miami\nHeat for less money, bringing the five-year 'Big Three' era to a somewhat\nacrimonious end. The Celtics also signed free agents [Jason\nTerry](/wiki/Jason_Terry \"Jason Terry\"), [Jason Collins](/wiki/Jason_Collins\n\"Jason Collins\"), [Darko Miličić](/wiki/Darko_Mili%C4%8Di%C4%87 \"Darko\nMiličić\") and [Leandro Barbosa](/wiki/Leandro_Barbosa \"Leandro Barbosa\");\nacquired [Courtney Lee](/wiki/Courtney_Lee \"Courtney Lee\") in a three-team\nsign and trade – where Johnson, Moore, Sean Williams and a future second round\npick were sent to the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trail Blazers got Sasha\nPavlovic; drafted three players, [Jared Sullinger](/wiki/Jared_Sullinger\n\"Jared Sullinger\"), [Fab Melo](/wiki/Fab_Melo \"Fab Melo\") and [Kris\nJoseph](/wiki/Kris_Joseph \"Kris Joseph\"); and renewed with [Brandon\nBass](/wiki/Brandon_Bass \"Brandon Bass\") along with [Chris\nWilcox](/wiki/Chris_Wilcox \"Chris Wilcox\") and [Jeff\nGreen](/wiki/Jeff_Green_\\(basketball\\) \"Jeff Green \\(basketball\\)\"), who both\nwere returning to play after sustaining season-ending heart ailments.\n\nDespite losing Rondo and Sullinger to injury, the Celtics compiled a seven-\ngame winning streak, including victories over the Heat in double overtime and\nthe Nuggets in triple overtime. The winning streak was snapped on February 12\nwhen Leandro Barbosa suffered a season-ending torn ACL.

It was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics\nhead coach [Red Auerbach](/wiki/Red_Auerbach \"Red Auerbach\").[158] For a long\ntime, the logo's only colors were black, white and green.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Then\nfor the [1996–97 season](/wiki/1996%E2%80%9397_NBA_season \"1996–97 NBA\nseason\"), celebrating the club's 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color\ntreatment. Lucky's face and hands were both painted tan, while gold was\nincluded on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and\n[shillelagh](/wiki/Shillelagh_\\(club\\) \"Shillelagh \\(club\\)\"), and black on\nits pants and shoes.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a\nwhite [shamrock](/wiki/Shamrock \"Shamrock\") with the letters \"Celtics\" above\nit, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the [1998–99\nseason](/wiki/1998%E2%80%9399_NBA_season \"1998–99 NBA season\"). The alternate\nlogo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach\nleprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen\nin the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014,\nfeatured a variation of the leprechaun logo, albeit in silhouette\nform.[159][160]\n\n### Uniforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Boston_Celtics&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Uniforms\")]\n\nThe Celtics jerseys have always been green on away games and white on home\ngames since their inception in 1946. Except for some minor modifications, most\nnotably the road 'Boston' script and the serifed version of the uniforms\nduring the [Bill Russell](/wiki/Bill_Russell \"Bill Russell\") era, the jerseys\nremained unchanged through the years.\n\nBeginning in [2005–06](/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_NBA_season \"2005–06 NBA season\"),\nthe Celtics began using alternate home/road jerseys which are green with black\nlettering and trim featuring the word \"Boston\" on the front side of the\njersey. The alternate jersey made few appearances in its first 2 seasons, but\nsince [2007](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_NBA_season \"2007–08 NBA season\") it has\nbeen used much more often, in more than half of the road games. The uniforms\ntraditionally make their debut on the last Friday of November home games, and\nare used on the road for games after that, though they also wear it at home on\na few occasions.\n\nAlso, in [2005–06](/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_NBA_season \"2005–06 NBA season\"), the\nCeltics began a tradition of wearing green jerseys with gold trim as part of\nthe [St. Patrick's Day](/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_Day \"St. Patrick's Day\")\ncelebrations the [NBA](/wiki/National_Basketball_Association \"National\nBasketball Association\") puts into place every third week of March. Except for\nthe word \"Boston\" in front and the gold trim, the St. Patrick's Day jerseys\nresemble the regular road jerseys. For the first four years, the St. Paddy's\njerseys were used four times, a majority of which on the road; however in the\n[2009–10 NBA season](/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_NBA_season \"2009–10 NBA season\"),\nthey were used just twice (both home games). They wore them six times in the\n2011–12 season; wearing them at its earliest on March 9, their final home game\nbefore an eight-game road trip. The uniform was the only one in the current\nCeltics set that does not use the [Adidas](/wiki/Adidas \"Adidas\") Revolution\n30 design.\n\nDuring the [2006–07 season](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_NBA_season \"2006–07 NBA\nseason\"), the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black\n[shamrock](/wiki/Shamrock \"Shamrock\") with the nickname \"Red\" in green letters\non the right top of the jersey in remembrance of [Red\nAuerbach](/wiki/Red_Auerbach \"Red Auerbach\"), who died shortly prior to the\nbeginning of the season.[161]\n\nDuring the [NBA Europe Live Tour](/wiki/2007_NBA_Europe_Live_Tour \"2007 NBA\nEurope Live Tour\") prior to the [2007–08\nseason](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_NBA_season \"2007–08 NBA season\"), the Celtics\nused the alternate road jerseys in their game against the [Toronto\nRaptors](/wiki/Toronto_Raptors \"Toronto Raptors\") in Rome, except that the\nwords \"Boston\" on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts\nand on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red\n[tricolors](/wiki/Flag_of_Italy \"Flag of Italy\") of the [Italian\nflag](/wiki/Flag_of_Italy \"Flag of Italy\"). In the second game in London, the\nregular road jerseys featured a patch containing the [Union\nJack](/wiki/Union_Jack \"Union Jack\").\n\nAt the [2008–09 season](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_NBA_season \"2008–09 NBA season\")\nopener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of\ntheir home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's\nchampionship team.\n\nIn the [2013–14 season](/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_NBA_season \"2013–14 NBA\nseason\"), the Celtics replaced their alternate St. Patrick's uniform with a\nnew, sleeved version. Unlike the previous uniform, the front featured the team\nname in front, gold side panels and a white shamrock at the back, while the\nshorts closely resemble the green/black third uniform save for the gold\naccents. For the 2015–16 season, the Celtics decided to go with a green/gold\nvariation of their alternate uniform for St. Patrick's week.\n\nA home grey alternate sleeved uniform was unveiled on November 6, 2014. The\nuniform features a serifed vertical arch 'Celtics' wordmark in white with\ngreen trim, with names in green and numbers in white with green trim. In\naddition, it features a pattern of the Celtics' famed [parquet\nfloor](/wiki/Parquetry \"Parquetry\") on the sides, a silhouette version of\ntheir leprechaun logo on the waistband, and a green shamrock on the left leg\nof the shorts. The grey uniforms were used for six home dates during the\nseason.[162] Also that season, the shamrock that had been present at the back\nof the uniforms since the 2006–07 season was replaced by the NBA logo, while a\ngold tab representing the club's 17 championships was stitched atop the neck\nstripe.\n\nThe Celtics have also worn special edition [Christmas\nDay](/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Christmas_games \"National\nBasketball Association Christmas games\") uniforms since the 2008–09 season.\nFor the first four games, they wore their regular road uniforms modified with\nthe NBA logo inside a [snowflake](/wiki/Snowflake \"Snowflake\"). Then in the\n[2012–13 season](/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_NBA_season \"2012–13 NBA season\"), they\nwore monochrome uniforms with green lettering trimmed in white. For the\n[2016–17 season](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_NBA_season \"2016–17 NBA season\"), the\nCeltics wore a special green uniform with a more ornate script lettering, but\nwithout the additional striping.\n\nThe team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a\ncommemorative black band on the left shoulder strap of the jersey. It has been\nfeatured eight times in the history of the franchise: [Walter\nBrown](/wiki/Walter_A._Brown \"Walter A. Brown\")\n([1964–65](/wiki/1964%E2%80%9365_NBA_season \"1964–65 NBA season\")), [Bob\nSchmertz](/wiki/Robert_Schmertz \"Robert Schmertz\")\n([1975–76](/wiki/1975%E2%80%9376_NBA_season \"1975–76 NBA season\")), Joan Cohen\n([1989–90](/wiki/1989%E2%80%9390_NBA_season \"1989–90 NBA season\")), [Johnny\nMost](/wiki/Johnny_Most \"Johnny Most\")\n([1993–94](/wiki/1993%E2%80%9394_NBA_season \"1993–94 NBA season\")), [Reggie\nLewis](/wiki/Reggie_Lewis \"Reggie Lewis\")\n([1993–94](/wiki/1993%E2%80%9394_NBA_season \"1993–94 NBA season\")), Dorothy\nAuerbach ([2000–01](/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_NBA_season \"2000–01 NBA season\")),\n[Dennis Johnson](/wiki/Dennis_Johnson \"Dennis Johnson\")\n([2006–07](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_NBA_season \"2006–07 NBA season\")).[161] and\n[Jim Loscutoff](/wiki/Jim_Loscutoff \"Jim Loscutoff\")\n([2015–16](/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_NBA_season \"2015–16 NBA season\")).\n\nThe team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of\ntheir history, except during the early 1980s when they wore green sneakers.\nAccording to legend, Celtics patriarch [Red Auerbach](/wiki/Red_Auerbach \"Red\nAuerbach\") had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white\nsneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black\nsneakers. But prior to the [2003–04 season](/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_NBA_season\n\"2003–04 NBA season\"), current Celtics GM [Danny Ainge](/wiki/Danny_Ainge\n\"Danny Ainge\") and captain [Paul Pierce](/wiki/Paul_Pierce \"Paul Pierce\")\nsuggested wearing white sneakers, in due part to a growing number of teams\nwearing black sneakers. Auerbach gladly accepted and the white sneakers have\nremained since on home games. They still wore the black sneakers on away\ngames, but in the [2008–09 season](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_NBA_season \"2008–09\nNBA season\"), they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while\nwearing their St. Patrick's Day jerseys on the road. Most recently, when the\nCeltics play on [Christmas\nDay](/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Christmas_games \"National\nBasketball Association Christmas games\"), they wore white or green sneakers\nwith red and gold accents.[163] Since the 2009–10 season, the NBA relaxed its\nrules on specified sneaker colors, and Celtics players are now seen wearing\neither green, white or black sneakers at home and on the road.\n\nThe Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on\nthe back. During the 1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup\njackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually declined. The Celtics,\nhowever, kept the design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the\npractice after the 2011–12 season. By that time Adidas issues a new warmup\njacket design annually, and for a few seasons, they provided players with a\ncustomized shooting shirt containing the player's name and uniform number on\nthe back.\n\nIn January 2017, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with [General\nElectric](/wiki/General_Electric \"General Electric\") where they will become\nthe \"exclusive Data and Analytics partner\" for the team. As part of the deal,\nthe uniforms will have the GE logo prominently placed on the left shoulder of\nCeltics' jerseys in green and white. This will be the first time a corporate\nlogo will have placement on the game uniforms.[164][165]\n\nWith the switch to [Nike](/wiki/Nike,_Inc. \"Nike, Inc.\") as the uniform\nprovider in 2017, the NBA's home and away uniform designations were abolished.\nThe Celtics' green \"Icon\" and white \"Association\" uniforms, to be worn either\nat home or away, remained mostly intact save for truncated striping on the\nshoulders and shorts. In addition, the Celtics unveiled a third \"Statement\"\nuniform, with black as the base color and letters and striping in green and\nwhite trim. A fourth uniform design, dubbed the \"Community\" uniform, will be\nunveiled during the 2017–18 season.\n\n## Television and\nradio[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Boston_Celtics&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit\nsection: Television and radio\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Boston Celtics\nbroadcasters](/wiki/List_of_Boston_Celtics_broadcasters \"List of Boston\nCeltics broadcasters\")\n\n[Comcast SportsNet New England](/wiki/Comcast_SportsNet_New_England \"Comcast\nSportsNet New England\") is the Boston Celtics' main television outlet, having\naired its games since 1981 when the station was known as\n[SportsChannel](/wiki/SportsChannel_America \"SportsChannel America\") New\nEngland.
