There was also [a 1977 film](/wiki/Are_You_Being_Served%3F_\\(film\\)\n\"Are You Being Served? \\(film\\)\"), [a follow-up series](/wiki/Grace_%26_Favour\n\"Grace & Favour\") with some of the same main cast in 1991–92, and a one-off\nepisode with a new cast in 2016.\n\n_Are You Being Served?_ was a great success in the UK and was also popular in\nthree other countries of the [Commonwealth of\nNations](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations \"Commonwealth of Nations\") (Australia,\nNew Zealand, and Canada), and was successfully aired in The Netherlands and\nBelgium with Dutch subtitles as well. The show was also popular in Israel and\nin the United States, where it gained a loyal and enthusiastic following when\n[PBS](/wiki/PBS \"PBS\") television stations began airing [reruns](/wiki/Rerun\n\"Rerun\") of it in the mid-1980s, along with other [British\nsitcoms](/wiki/British_sitcom \"British sitcom\"). In it was ranked 20th in the\ncountdown of _[Britain's Best Sitcom](/wiki/Britain%27s_Best_Sitcom \"Britain's\nBest Sitcom\")_.[3] It is regularly repeated worldwide ([BBC Two](/wiki/BBC_Two\n\"BBC Two\") in the UK, [PBS](/wiki/PBS \"PBS\") and [BBC\nAmerica](/wiki/BBC_America \"BBC America\") in the United States; and [BBC\nUKTV](/wiki/BBC_UKTV \"BBC UKTV\"), [Fox Classics](/wiki/Fox_Classics \"Fox\nClassics\") and [9Go!](/wiki/9Go! \"9Go!\") in Australia.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Critical reception\n    * 1.2 International broadcasts\n    * 1.3 _The Best of Are You Being Served?_ (1992)\n    * 1.4 Episodes\n  * 2 Spin-offs\n    * 2.1 Film version\n    * 2.2 Adaptations in other countries\n    * 2.3 2016 revival\n  * 3 Characters\n    * 3.1 Main characters\n  * 4 Theme song\n  * 5 Merchandise\n    * 5.1 DVD releases\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Are_You_Being_Served%3F&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe idea for the show came from Lloyd's brief period in the early 1950s\nworking at [Simpsons of Piccadilly](/wiki/Simpsons_of_Piccadilly \"Simpsons of\nPiccadilly\"), a clothing store which traded for over 60 years until 1999.[4]\nThe inspiration for the store has also been credited to Rossiters of\n[Paignton](/wiki/Paignton \"Paignton\") department store from the time Lloyd and\nCroft spent there,[5] and the former Clements of [Watford](/wiki/Watford\n\"Watford\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Are_You_Being_Served_series_1_logo.svg/220px-\nAre_You_Being_Served_series_1_logo.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Are_You_Being_Served_series_1_logo.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Are_You_Being_Served_series_1_logo.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLogo used for series one\n\nThe [pilot episode](/wiki/Pilot_episode \"Pilot episode\") was created as part\nof the _[Comedy Playhouse](/wiki/Comedy_Playhouse \"Comedy Playhouse\")_ series,\nalthough the [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\") had originally chosen not to broadcast the\nprogramme. The pilot was used as a filler during the [1972 Summer\nOlympics](/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics \"1972 Summer Olympics\") when the coverage\nof the Olympiad was interrupted by the [Munich massacre](/wiki/Munich_massacre\n\"Munich massacre\") on 8 September 1972, leading to a full series being\nproduced.[6] This first episode was repeated at the beginning of the first\nseries on 14 March 1973. Although the first series was aired in the same\ntimeslot as _[Coronation Street](/wiki/Coronation_Street \"Coronation Street\")_\non [ITV](/wiki/ITV_\\(TV_network\\) \"ITV \\(TV network\\)\"), consequently\nreceiving relatively little attention, the repeats shown later in the year\nwere much more successful.[7]\n\nThe show became a ratings hit, and after a successful 13-year run, _Are You\nBeing Served?_ came to an end on 1 April 1985.\n\nOf the original cast, only [Frank Thornton](/wiki/Frank_Thornton \"Frank\nThornton\"), [Mollie Sugden](/wiki/Mollie_Sugden \"Mollie Sugden\"), [John\nInman](/wiki/John_Inman \"John Inman\"), [Wendy Richard](/wiki/Wendy_Richard\n\"Wendy Richard\") and [Nicholas Smith](/wiki/Nicholas_Smith_\\(actor\\) \"Nicholas\nSmith \\(actor\\)\") appeared in all 69 episodes of the programme's 13-year run;\nthese five later featured in the sequel sitcom, _[Grace&\nFavour](/wiki/Grace_%26_Favour \"Grace & Favour\")_ (also known as _Are You\nBeing Served? Again!_). The cast performed in character for a stage sketch on\nthe [BBC1](/wiki/BBC_One \"BBC One\") programme _Variety_ on 19 June 1976.\n\nFollowing the death of the last remaining original cast member, Nicholas\nSmith, on 6 December 2015, the only surviving permanent cast members are [Mike\nBerry](/wiki/Mike_Berry_\\(actor\\) \"Mike Berry \\(actor\\)\") as Mr Spooner,\n[Candy Davis](/wiki/Candy_Davis \"Candy Davis\") (Miss Belfridge in the final\ntwo seasons), [Penny Irving](/wiki/Penny_Irving \"Penny Irving\"), who played Mr\nGrace's secretary Miss Bakewell between 1976 and 1979, and [Vivienne\nJohnson](/wiki/Vivienne_Johnson \"Vivienne Johnson\"), who played both Young and\nOld Mr Grace's nurse from 1977 to 1981. [Doremy Vernon](/wiki/Doremy_Vernon\n\"Doremy Vernon\"), starring as feisty canteen manageress Diana Yardwick over\nseveral seasons, also survives; however, she only appeared on a recurring\nbasis and was never part of the regular cast.[8]\n\nAlthough the pilot was produced in colour, the [videotape](/wiki/Videotape\n\"Videotape\") was wiped in the 1970s leaving only a 16mm [black-and-\nwhite](/wiki/Black-and-white \"Black-and-white\") film\n[telerecording](/wiki/Telerecording \"Telerecording\").[9] In 2009, the pilot\nepisode was restored to colour using the [colour\nrecovery](/wiki/Colour_recovery \"Colour recovery\") technique previously used\nfor the _[Dad's Army](/wiki/Dad%27s_Army \"Dad's Army\")_ episode \"[Room at the\nBottom](/wiki/Room_at_the_Bottom \"Room at the Bottom\")\". The restored colour\nversion was first shown on BBC2 on 1 January 2010 as part of a special _Are\nYou Being Served?_ night.\n\n### Critical\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Are_You_Being_Served%3F&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Critical reception\")]\n\nThe series gained much of its popularity with TV viewers by \"[pushing the\nenvelope](/wiki/Pushing_the_envelope \"Pushing the envelope\")\" through its\ndeliberate-yet-subtle use of [risqué](/wiki/Sexual_suggestiveness \"Sexual\nsuggestiveness\") [visual gags](/wiki/Visual_gag \"Visual gag\"),\n[innuendo](/wiki/Innuendo \"Innuendo\")-infused dialogue and cleverly-disguised\n[sophomoric humour](/wiki/Sophomoric_humor \"Sophomoric humor\"). These comical\ndevices also attracted some mild criticism, in part for relying on sexual\n[stereotypes](/wiki/Stereotype \"Stereotype\") and [double\nentendres](/wiki/Double_entendre \"Double entendre\") – e.g., Mrs Slocombe\ndiscussing her cat: \"Animals are very psychic...the least sign of danger and\nmy [pussy](/wiki/Pussy#Female_genitalia \"Pussy\")'s hair stands on end\".\n\nJohn Inman's portrayal of Humphries' over-the-top antics and sharp-tongued,\nwitty responses, along with his trademark [catch-phrase](/wiki/Catch-phrase\n\"Catch-phrase\") \"I'm free!\", were enthusiastically embraced by many audience\nmembers, and the character evolved into a [gay icon](/wiki/Gay_icon \"Gay\nicon\") in popular culture. Despite this, Inman pointed out that Mr Humphries'\ntrue sexual orientation was never explicitly stated in the series, and David\nCroft said in an interview that the character was not homosexual, but \"just a\nmother's boy\".[10] In an episode of the spin-off _[Grace&\nFavour](/wiki/Grace_%26_Favour \"Grace & Favour\")_, the character is further\ndescribed as neither a \"woman's man\" nor a \"man's man\" and as being \"in\nlimbo\".\n\nThe characters (Mr Humphries especially) sometimes broke the [fourth\nwall](/wiki/Fourth_wall \"Fourth wall\") for comical effect.\n\n### International\nbroadcasts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Are_You_Being_Served%3F&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: International broadcasts\")]\n\nThe series was shown in the United States on [PBS](/wiki/PBS \"PBS\") stations\nand on [BBC America](/wiki/BBC_America \"BBC America\"), as well as in many\n[Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations \"Commonwealth of Nations\")\nnations around the world. PBS first began airing it (on 24 stations) in 1987,\nand viewership steadily climbed as more stations carried it. By the early\n1990s, it had gained such a loyal following that American viewers of the show\nformed fan clubs and were in large attendance wherever cast members made guest\nappearances.\n\n_Are You Being Served?_ aired in Canada late night on\n[YTV](/wiki/YTV_\\(TV_channel\\) \"YTV \\(TV channel\\)\"). It also became available\nto Canadian viewers on PBS station WNED (Buffalo). The show aired on Saturday\nevening prime time from the mid 1980s to late 1990s.\n\nThe series was also extremely popular in Australia. It started on [ABC\nTelevision](/wiki/ABC_Television \"ABC Television\") in 1974 and was repeated by\nABC in Australia several times.[11] By 1978 it had been acquired by the\ncommercial [Seven Network](/wiki/Seven_Network \"Seven Network\") who\nsuccessfully screened repeats of the program to audiences larger than those\nwho viewed it on the ABC.[12] _Are You Being Served?_ was ranked as the top\nrated show on Australian television for 1978, being watched by 2,255,000\npeople in five cities.[13]\n\n### _The Best of Are You Being Served?_\n(1992)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Are_You_Being_Served%3F&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: The Best of Are You Being Served? \\(1992\\)\")]\n\nBuoyed by the huge success of the series in the United States, [BBC\nAmerica](/wiki/BBC_America \"BBC America\") commissioned a special straight-to-\nVHS compilation in 1992. Running at 78 minutes, _The Best of Are You Being\nServed_ featured newly-shot scenes of Mr Humphries reminiscing with his\nelderly mother, Annie, about his time working at Grace Brothers. Both roles\nwere played by [John Inman](/wiki/John_Inman \"John Inman\"). The additional\nsequences were filmed in America, and directed by Don Hopfer.\n\n###\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Are_You_Being_Served%3F&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Are You Being Served?\nepisodes](/wiki/List_of_Are_You_Being_Served%3F_episodes \"List of Are You\nBeing Served? episodes\")\n\n## Spin-\noffs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Are_You_Being_Served%3F&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Spin-offs\")]\n\nIn 1992, most of the original cast reunited for a spin-off show, titled\n_[Grace& Favour](/wiki/Grace_%26_Favour \"Grace & Favour\")_ in Britain and\nAustralia, and _[Are You Being Served\nAgain!](/wiki/Are_You_Being_Served_Again! \"Are You Being Served Again!\")_ in\nthe United States and Canada. It ran for two series.\n\n### Film\nversion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Are_You_Being_Served%3F&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Film version\")]\n\nMain article: [Are You Being Served?\n(film)](/wiki/Are_You_Being_Served%3F_\\(film\\) \"Are You Being Served?\n\\(film\\)\")\n\nIn 1977, as for many other popular\n[British](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/British \"wikt:British\") sitcoms of\nthe time, including _[On the Buses](/wiki/On_the_Buses \"On the Buses\")_ , a\nfeature film was produced: the _[Are You Being\nServed?](/wiki/Are_You_Being_Served%3F_\\(film\\) \"Are You Being Served?\n\\(film\\)\")_ film had the same characters and cast. It was set in the fictional\nresort of Costa Plonka, in Spain. The film was an adaptation of the successful\nstage version of the show, which played at the Winter Gardens Theatre,\nBlackpool over the summer of 1976.\n\n### Adaptations in other\ncountries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Are_You_Being_Served%3F&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Adaptations in other countries\")]\n\nA US adaptation pilot episode called _[Beane's of\nBoston](/wiki/Beane%27s_of_Boston \"Beane's of Boston\")_ aired on 5 May 1979 on\n[CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\"), but it did not make it to series.\n\nAn [Australian spin-\noff](/wiki/Are_You_Being_Served%3F_\\(Australian_TV_series\\) \"Are You Being\nServed? \\(Australian TV series\\)\"), also called _Are You Being Served?_ , ran\nfor sixteen episodes from 1980 to 1981 on [Network Ten](/wiki/Network_Ten\n\"Network Ten\"). It starred [John Inman](/wiki/John_Inman \"John Inman\") as Mr\nHumphries, and Australian actors as copies of characters of the original\nseries ([June Bronhill](/wiki/June_Bronhill \"June Bronhill\") as a character\nsimilar to Mrs Slocombe, [Shane Bourne](/wiki/Shane_Bourne \"Shane Bourne\") as\na character similar to Mr. Lucas, and so on). The show takes place in the\nfictional Bone Brothers store, as \"[Grace Bros.](/wiki/Grace_Bros. \"Grace\nBros.\")\" was the name of an actual department store chain in Australia. While\nmost episodes were somewhat direct re-films of old scripts (with minor changes\nlike names), the first episode features a new start showing Mr Humphries\njoining from Grace Bros, and a series 2 episode is completely original,\ndealing with Mr Humphries' visa running out.\n\nThe Singaporean [MediaCorp](/wiki/MediaCorp \"MediaCorp\") sitcom _Can I Help\nYou?_ had a similar title and premise, and was described by former cast member\n[Vernetta Lopez](/wiki/Vernetta_Lopez \"Vernetta Lopez\") as \"_Are You Being\nServed_ , minus the wonderfully filthy jokes\".[14]\n\n### 2016\nrevival[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Are_You_Being_Served%3F&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: 2016 revival\")]\n\nIn 2016, a one-off revival episode was broadcast, as part of BBC's celebration\nof 60 years of television sitcoms.[15] It was set in 1988 with the original\ncharacters, played by a new set of actors.\n\nCaptain Peacock was played by [John Challis](/wiki/John_Challis \"John\nChallis\"), Mrs Slocombe by [Sherrie Hewson](/wiki/Sherrie_Hewson \"Sherrie\nHewson\"), Mr Humphries by [Jason Watkins](/wiki/Jason_Watkins_\\(actor\\) \"Jason\nWatkins \\(actor\\)\"), Miss Brahms by [Niky Wardley](/wiki/Niky_Wardley \"Niky\nWardley\"), Mr Grainger by [Roy Barraclough](/wiki/Roy_Barraclough \"Roy\nBarraclough\") (Grainger having come out of retirement \"To spend less time with\nhis wife\"), Mr Harman by [Arthur Smith](/wiki/Arthur_Smith_\\(comedian\\)\n\"Arthur Smith \\(comedian\\)\"), and Mr Rumbold by [Justin\nEdwards](/wiki/Justin_Edwards_\\(actor\\) \"Justin Edwards \\(actor\\)\").[16][17]\nNew characters in the show were Young Mr Grace's grandson – also called Young\nMr Grace – played by [Mathew Horne](/wiki/Mathew_Horne \"Mathew Horne\"), Miss\nCroft – named as a tribute to series co-creator David Croft – played by\n[Jorgie Porter](/wiki/Jorgie_Porter \"Jorgie Porter\"), and newcomer Mr Conway,\nplayed by [Kayode Ewumi](/w/index.php?title=Kayode_Ewumi&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Kayode Ewumi \\(page does not exist\\)\").

In addition, there were [sight gags](/wiki/Sight_gag \"Sight\ngag\") generated by outrageous costumes which the characters were sometimes\nrequired to wear for store promotions, and gaudy store displays frequently\nfeaturing malfunctioning robotic mannequins. The show is remembered for its\nprolific use of [double entendres](/wiki/Double_entendre \"Double entendre\").\n\nThe main humorous base of the series was a merciless parody of the [British\nclass system](/wiki/Social_structure_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Social structure\nof the United Kingdom\"). This permeated almost every interaction and was\nespecially evident in the conversations between the maintenance men and the\nostensibly higher-class store personnel. The episodes rarely left the store,\nand to parody the stereotype of the British class system, characters rarely\naddressed each other by their first names, even after work, instead using\ntheir formal titled names (\"Mr\", \"Mrs\", \"Miss\", or even \"Captain\").
