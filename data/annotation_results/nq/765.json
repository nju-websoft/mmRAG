It was announced at the company's [Worldwide\nDevelopers Conference](/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference \"Apple\nWorldwide Developers Conference\") on June 13, 2016, and was released on\nSeptember 13, 2016. It was succeeded by [iOS 11](/wiki/IOS_11 \"IOS 11\") on\nSeptember 19, 2017.[3]\n\niOS 10 incorporates changes to [3D Touch](/wiki/3D_Touch \"3D Touch\") and the\nlock screen. There are new features to some apps:\n[Messages](/wiki/Messages_\\(Apple\\) \"Messages \\(Apple\\)\") has additional\n[emojis](/wiki/Emoji \"Emoji\") and third-party apps can extend functionality in\niMessage, [Maps](/wiki/Apple_Maps \"Apple Maps\") has a redesigned interface and\nadditional third-party functions, the Home app manages \"HomeKit\"-enabled\naccessories, [Photos](/wiki/Photos_\\(Apple\\) \"Photos \\(Apple\\)\") has\nalgorithmic search and categorization of media known as \"Memories\", and\n[Siri](/wiki/Siri \"Siri\") is compatible with third-party app-specific\nrequests, such as starting workouts apps, sending\n[IMs](/wiki/Instant_messaging \"Instant messaging\"), requesting the\n[Lyft](/wiki/Lyft \"Lyft\") or [Uber](/wiki/Uber_\\(company\\) \"Uber \\(company\\)\")\napps or to use payment functions.\n\nReviews of iOS 10 were mostly positive. Reviewers highlighted the significant\nupdates to iMessage, Siri, Photos, 3D Touch, and the lock screen as welcome\nchanges. The third-party extension support to iMessage meant it was \"becoming\na platform\", although the user interface was criticized for being difficult to\nunderstand. Third-party integration in Siri was \"great\", although the voice\nassistant was criticized for not having become smarter than before. Reviewers\nwere impressed with the image recognition technology in Photos, although\nnoting it was still a \"work in progress\" with a higher error rate than the\ncompetition. 3D Touch \"finally feels useful\" and \"works in almost every part\nof the OS\". The lock screen was \"far more customizable than before\", and\nreviewers enjoyed that notification bubbles could be expanded to see more\ninformation without needing to unlock the phone.\n\nA month after release, iOS 10 was installed on 54% of iOS devices, a \"slightly\nslower migration\" than for the release of iOS 9, speculated as being caused by\nan early release issue that may have \"put some [users] off downloading the\nupdate\". User adoption of iOS 10 steadily increased in the following months,\neventually totaling 89% of active devices in September 2017.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Introduction and initial release\n    * 1.2 Updates\n      * 1.2.1 10.0.1\n      * 1.2.2 10.0.2\n      * 1.2.3 10.0.3\n      * 1.2.4 10.1\n      * 1.2.5 10.1.1\n      * 1.2.6 10.2\n      * 1.2.7 10.2.1\n      * 1.2.8 10.3\n      * 1.2.9 10.3.1\n      * 1.2.10 10.3.2\n      * 1.2.11 10.3.3\n  * 2 System features\n    * 2.1 Control Center\n    * 2.2 Home screen\n    * 2.3 Keyboard\n    * 2.4 Lock screen\n    * 2.5 Notification Center\n    * 2.6 Settings\n      * 2.6.1 CarPlay\n    * 2.7 Universal Clipboard\n    * 2.8 Other changes\n  * 3 App features\n    * 3.1 App Store\n    * 3.2 Calendar\n    * 3.3 Camera\n    * 3.4 Clock\n    * 3.5 Contacts\n    * 3.6 Home\n    * 3.7 Mail\n    * 3.8 Maps\n    * 3.9 Messages\n    * 3.10 Music\n    * 3.11 News\n    * 3.12 Notes\n    * 3.13 Photos\n    * 3.14 Phone\n    * 3.15 Safari\n    * 3.16 TV\n  * 4 Developer APIs\n  * 5 Removed functionality\n  * 6 Reception\n  * 7 Problems\n    * 7.1 Initial release bricking issue\n    * 7.2 Local backup encryption issue\n    * 7.3 Battery shutdowns\n  * 8 Supported devices\n    * 8.1 iPhone\n    * 8.2 iPod Touch\n    * 8.3 iPad\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nFurther information: [iOS version history § iOS\n10](/wiki/IOS_version_history#iOS_10 \"IOS version history\")\n\n### Introduction and initial\nrelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section:\nIntroduction and initial release\")]\n\niOS 10 was introduced at the [Apple Worldwide Developers\nConference](/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference \"Apple Worldwide\nDevelopers Conference\") keynote address on June 13, 2016.[4] The first beta\nrelease was made available to registered developers following the keynote.[5]\nApple released the first public beta release on July 7, 2016.[6]\n\niOS 10 was officially released on September 13, 2016.[7]\n\n### Updates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Updates\")]\n\n#### 10.0.1[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: 10.0.1\")]\n\niOS 10.0.1 was released on September 13, 2016, as the first update to iOS 10.\nIt was released just after 10.0, which contained a bug causing devices to\n[brick](/wiki/Brick_\\(electronics\\) \"Brick \\(electronics\\)\") themselves while\nupdating.[8][9]\n\n#### 10.0.2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: 10.0.2\")]\n\niOS 10.0.2 was released on September 23, 2016.

Store\")]\n\niOS 10 allows developers to buy advertisement spots in the [App\nStore](/wiki/App_Store_\\(iOS\\) \"App Store \\(iOS\\)\") when users search for\ncontent.[98][99] It also adds back the \"Categories\" section, which replaces\nthe \"Explore\" section introduced in [iOS 8](/wiki/IOS_8 \"IOS 8\").[100]\n\nIn iOS 10.3, developers are able to respond to user reviews,[101] and\n\"Helpful\" and \"Not Helpful\" review labels can help surface the most relevant\ncustomer reviews.[26]\n\n### Calendar[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=27 \"Edit\nsection: Calendar\")]\n\nIn iOS 10, users can now change what day of the week the calendar starts on,\nas well as alert settings for birthdays and events, and calendar type\n([Gregorian](/wiki/Gregorian_calendar \"Gregorian

email\naddresses for contacts who have multiple numbers or addresses.[110] The app\nalso allows the user to add and remove contacts from the Favorite Contacts\nlist.[111]\n\n### Home[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit\nsection: Home\")]\n\nHome is a new app that allows users to manage appliances compatible with\nHomeKit, Apple's [API](/wiki/Application_programming_interface \"Application\nprogramming interface\") for [home automation](/wiki/Home_automation \"Home\nautomation\").[67] In the app, users can add compatible HomeKit accessories,\nsuch as locks, lights, and thermostats, and then directly control the\nappliances through the app.[112]\n\nA \"Scenes\" panel allows many devices to be controlled at once to fit a mood or\nsetting.[108] [Geo-fencing](/wiki/Geo-fence \"Geo-fence\") activates scheduled\nsequences following the user's location.[60]\n\n### Mail[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit\nsection: Mail\")]\n\nThe [Mail](/wiki/Mail_\\(Apple\\) \"Mail \\(Apple\\)\") app now allows users to\nunsubscribe from mailing lists with an Unsubscribe button.[108][113][114]\nUsers can dismiss the message to unsubscribe for a particular mailing list by\ntapping the \"X\" at the top right corner, preventing the Mail app from\ndisplaying the unsubscribe button for that mailing list again later.[115]\n\nApple has added back support for [HTML5](/wiki/HTML5 \"HTML5\") video in Mail,\nwhich was previously stopped in [iOS 8](/wiki/IOS_8 \"IOS 8\").[116]\n\nMail can filter messages, either by unread/read, or by categories.[78][117]\n\niOS 10 also changes how email [threading](/wiki/Conversation_threading\n\"Conversation threading\") works, by placing the oldest email at the top by\ndefault. An option in Settings lets users revert to the previous threading\nsystem with the most recent message on top.[118][119] Additionally, the new\nthreaded conversations allow users to tap a message to see a scrollable stream\nof messages inside the thread.[56]\n\n### Maps[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit\nsection: Maps\")]\n\n[Maps](/wiki/Apple_Maps \"Apple Maps\") has been redesigned and updated with\nadditional features, including scanning calendar events for locations,\n[learning from a user's typical actions](/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine\nlearning\"), and a redesigned driving view.[120]\n\nA marker can be automatically placed to indicate the user's parked\ncar.[121][122][123] The marker can also tell the user when they last parked\ntheir car, and a Notes field allows the user to enter information, such as\nparking garage number, in the app.[124]\n\nThe app now helps users find the nearest gas station, fast-food restaurant or\ncoffee shop, by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. Maps also estimates\nhow long the detour will take.[125]\n\nUsers can add third-party extensions to the Maps app, which enable additional\nfunctionality, such as a restaurant-booking extension can help the user\nreserve a table from inside the Maps app.[126]\n\nUsers can now pan and zoom while in navigation mode.[127]\n\nThe app displays the current [temperature](/wiki/Temperature \"Temperature\")\nand weather conditions in the bottom right corner.[128] In iOS 10.3, the app\nalso allows the user to see a weather forecast by using 3D Touch on the\ncurrent temperature.[129][83] This functionality allows users to see an hour-\nby-hour breakdown of the area that they are looking at.[130]\n\n### Messages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit\nsection: Messages\")]\n\nThe [Messages](/wiki/Messages_\\(Apple\\) \"Messages \\(Apple\\)\") app incorporates\nits own App Store, which lets users download third-party iMessage apps that\ncan be accessed within iMessage conversations. Users can use them to send\n[stickers](/wiki/Sticker_\\(Internet\\) \"Sticker \\(Internet\\)\"), play games or\nsend [rich content](/wiki/Rich_content \"Rich content\"), such as media\npreviews, to recipients.[131] The Messages App Store has three navigation\nfields: Featured, Categories, and Manage.[132][133]\n\nThe app has been updated to include many visual effects. Chat bubbles, for\nexample, can be sent with a \"loud\" or \"gentle\" animation that the recipient\nsees upon receiving. \"Invisible ink\" effect obscures the message until the\nrecipient swipes across it. Full-screen effects like balloons, confetti or\nfireworks can be sent. There is also support for interactions similar to the\nApple Watch, such as sending quick sketches and recording and sending the\nuser's heartbeat.[60][46][134] In order to use the screen and bubble effects,\nthe Reduce Motion setting needs to be turned off.[135][136]\n\nMessages now allows users to send handwritten notes.[72] This is done by\nturning the device to landscape mode for iPhones (landscape or portrait for\n[iPad](/wiki/IPad \"IPad\") users) and then tapping the handwriting\nsquiggle.[137] The Messages app automatically saves recently used notes, to\nmake it easier to send them again. A handwritten message can be deleted in the\nsame way an app is deleted; by holding down on the message and pressing\nDelete.[138] The message can also be saved as a picture file.[139]\n\nNew [emojis](/wiki/Emoji \"Emoji\") have been added, as well as additional\nfeatures related to emoji. Emojis appear 3x bigger if messages are sent with\nup to three emojis and no text, the keyboard can now predict emojis to use,\nand an emoji replacement feature attempts to match words in messages and\nreplace them with emojis of the same meaning.[140]\n\nSince the [Game Center](/wiki/Game_Center \"Game Center\") app has been removed,\nMessages now handles actions such as inviting friends to a game.[141]\n\n[Read receipts](/wiki/Read_receipt \"Read receipt\") can now be turned on or off\nfor individual contacts rather than for all contacts.[142][143]\n\n### Music[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit\nsection: Music\")]\n\nThe Music app has been redesigned, with an emphasis placed on usability. The\n\"For You\" section has been reorganized, with a playlist offering daily music\nrecommendations. The \"New\" tab has been renamed \"Browse\". A new tab for music\nthat has been downloaded called \"Downloaded Music\" has been added.[144]\n\nLyrics are viewable for songs in-app in iOS 10.[108][145] The \"Search\" tab\nincludes recent and trending searches.[146] An \"Optimized Storage\" option\nremoves downloaded music that the user hasn't played in a while.[147]\n\n### News[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=36 \"Edit\nsection: News\")]\n\nThe [News](/wiki/News_\\(Apple\\) \"News \\(Apple\\)\") app, taking cues from the\nMusic layout, has been redesigned to incorporate bold headings and a\nnewspaper-esque layout in the redesigned \"For You\" tab. News also features\nsupport for subscriptions and provides notifications for breaking\nnews.[148][149]\n\n### Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=37 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n[Notes](/wiki/Notes_\\(Apple\\) \"Notes \\(Apple\\)\") now has a collaboration\nfeature. This allows users to share a note and collaborate with other\nusers,[150] who can add and remove text from a note. Users tap a \"round yellow\nbadge with a person and a plus sign\" and can then send invitations through\ntext, email, or by link.[151]\n\n### Photos[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=38 \"Edit\nsection: Photos\")]\n\nApple added [deep learning](/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") capabilities\nfor sorting and searching in the Photos app.[152]\n\nA new \"Memories\" feature can automatically recognize and compile related\nphotos and create short, shareable music videos.[153] [local facial\nrecognition](/wiki/Facial_recognition_system \"Facial recognition system\")\nfunctionality was added to bundle together pictures of certain people.[154]\n\niOS 10 allows users to add doodles and text on a photo, using a new \"Markup\"\nfeature.[155][156] If the user edits a Live Photo using Markup, the image will\nbe turned into a still image.[157]\n\nLive Photos can now be edited by the Photos app.[72] This allows users to trim\nthe clip, change the still frame, add a filter and add [digital image\nstabilization](/wiki/Digital_image_stabilization \"Digital image\nstabilization\") to the Live Photo so it is \"buttery smooth\".[108]\n\nThe app also has an upgraded auto-enhance feature and adds a \"Brilliance\"\nslider.[158]\n\n### Phone[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=39 \"Edit\nsection: Phone\")]\n\nThe Phone app can transcribe received [visual\nvoicemails](/wiki/Visual_voicemail \"Visual voicemail\").[159]\n\nSiri can announce the name and phone number of incoming calls. The system can\nmark suspected spam callers on the call screen upon incoming calls.[108]\n\nContacts can be enabled for \"Emergency Bypass\", in which the phone will always\nmake sounds and vibrations when receiving notifications from the chosen\ncontacts, even during Do Not Disturb mode.[160]\n\nIn the Favorites screen, users can customize what action each favorited\ncontact will enable from a click, including call, FaceTime, SMS, or\nemail.[111]\n\nUsers can save voicemails through [AirDrop](/wiki/AirDrop \"AirDrop\"),\n[iMessage](/wiki/IMessage \"IMessage\"), [iCloud Drive](/wiki/ICloud_Drive\n\"ICloud Drive\") and other apps through a share menu.[161]\n\n### Safari[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=40 \"Edit\nsection: Safari\")]\n\n[Apple Pay](/wiki/Apple_Pay \"Apple Pay\") is now available through the Safari\napp.[162][163]\n\nThere is no limit to how many tabs users can have open at the same time.[164]\n\nOn supported [iPads](/wiki/IPad \"IPad\"), Safari has a unique \"Split View\" for\nviewing two Safari browser tabs in 50/50 mode next to each other.[165]\n\nUsers can also search for keywords in specific tabs,[164] close all tabs with\na single click,[166] and reopen recently closed tabs by long-pressing on the\nplus icon.[167] Users can also search for items in the Bookmarks and Reading\nList.[168]\n\n### TV[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=41 \"Edit section:\nTV\")]\n\nIncluded in the iOS 10.2 update is a \"[TV](/wiki/TV_\\(iOS_app\\) \"TV \\(iOS\napp\\)\")\" app.[18] The app, which is only available in the United States,\noffers a simple, unified experience of content from different video apps, as\nlong as each service supports the feature.[169][170] The new app replaces the\nVideos app found in previous iOS versions.[171]\n\n## Developer APIs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=42\n\"Edit section: Developer APIs\")]\n\niOS 10 gives third-party developers access to\n[APIs](/wiki/Application_programming_interface \"Application programming\ninterface\") to three major iOS system apps and services: Siri, iMessage, and\nMaps. Developers can:\n\n  * Turn certain activities into Siri voice commands, allowing users to speak voice queries into the Siri personal assistant and Siri returning results from the respective apps. Apps that can integrate with Siri are limited to: sending messages, starting calls, sending and requesting payments, search for photos and videos, ordering [taxicab](/wiki/Taxicab \"Taxicab\") or [ride-sharing](/wiki/Carpool \"Carpool\") services, and managing workouts.[46][120]\n  * Add dedicated apps to the iMessage App Store, that lets users add unique sticker packs, share rich content, or interact with certain app functions entirely within an iMessage conversation.[131]\n  * Add extensions to Apple Maps, so apps with specific functionality useful in a map, such as a restaurant-booking app, can integrate with the mapping service to handle app functionality directly in the Maps app.[126]\n\niOS 10 allows third-party camera apps to capture [RAW](/wiki/Raw_image_format\n\"Raw image format\") image format pictures.[172][173] Support for shooting\nphotos in Adobe's DNG RAW format is limited to devices with at least a 12MP\ncamera and a third-party app that supports it, as Apple did not enable the\nfeature in the native Camera app.[174][175]\n\niOS 10 allows [VoIP](/wiki/Voice_over_IP \"Voice over IP\") apps to have the\nsame functionality and interface as the Phone and FaceTime apps have, through\nthe use of a CallKit API.[176][177]\n\n## Removed\nfunctionality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=43 \"Edit\nsection: Removed functionality\")]\n\nNative support for the [VPN](/wiki/Virtual_private_network \"Virtual private\nnetwork\") protocol [PPTP](/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol \"Point-to-\nPoint Tunneling Protocol\") was removed. Apple recommends alternatives which it\nconsiders to be more secure.[178][179]\n\nThe options to group notifications by app in Notification Center and customize\nthe order of notifications were removed.[71]\n\n## Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=44 \"Edit\nsection: Reception\")]\n\nIn his review, _[The Verge](/wiki/The_Verge \"The Verge\")_ 's Dieter Bohn wrote\nthat the new features introduced in iOS 10 are \"an evolution of some of the\ndesign and interaction ideas that Apple has been working on for a couple of\nyears\". He wrote that iMessage is \"becoming a platform all its own\", and\nalthough he liked that extensions mean access to information from apps without\nneeding to open the respective apps, he wrote that new iMessage interface is\ndifficult to understand and that the use of \"third-party apps, stickers, crazy\nconfetti effects, and emoji all over the place\" is a \"nightmare\", although\nfinishing with \"Or maybe that's a wonderland, not a nightmare. Your call.\"\nRegarding third-party support in Siri, he called it \"great\", while noting the\nlimited class of apps (\"calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps,\nsome CarPlay systems, and workouts\"), and that sometimes a button press was\nrequired to complete the process. Beyond app integrations, he criticized Siri,\nwriting \"Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you\nremember\". Bohn enjoyed the new machine learning technology present in the\nPhotos app, writing that he was \"impressed\" by Apple's image recognition\ntechnology, which he noted is done locally on the device, but did criticize\nthe error rate, where he compares the technology to [Google\nPhotos](/wiki/Google_Photos \"Google Photos\") as a step ahead. Bohn liked the\nnew designs for the Music and Maps apps, saying both the redesigns were \"for\nthe better\". Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen, where he\nhighlighted that notification bubbles can be 3D Touch-ed to access more\ninformation, all without needing to unlock the phone. Other small bits of new\nfeatures he liked included \"deletable\" apps, upgraded \"widgets\" when 3D Touch-\ning a home screen icon, and breaking news notifications in Apple News.\nOverall, Bohn referred to iOS 10 as \"Still a walled garden, but with more\ndoors\".[180]\n\n_[Engadget](/wiki/Engadget \"Engadget\")_ 's Devindra Hardawar wrote that iOS 10\nis Apple \"basically polishing a pearl\". Hardawar noted that the major changes\nin the release focus on features rather than the visual interface. He wrote\nthat the lock screen is now \"far more customizable than before\". He praised\nthe new features added to 3D Touch, writing that it \"finally feels useful\",\nwhere he likes that \"3D Touch works in almost every part of the OS\". In regard\nto iMessage, he wrote that it has new features that are \"particularly useful\",\nincluding \"Invisible ink\" that obscures text in a conversation when others\nmight be looking, but criticized the user interface, writing that it \"needs\nsome work\". The \"Memories\" feature in the new Photos app \"usually turned out\nwell\", but wrote that \"they're still clearly a work in progress\". Hardawar\npraised the new Apple Music app, but added that \"really, anything is better\nthan the last iteration\". He also liked lyrics support. He wrote that Siri's\nthird-party support was \"actually starting to get useful\", but did run into\naccuracy issues. He finished by writing that although iOS 10 does add features\nseen in Google's [Android operating system](/wiki/Android_\\(operating_system\\)\n\"Android \\(operating system\\)\") before, the mobile industry is \"shamelessly\ngetting \"inspired\" by the competition\". His summary states that \"iOS 10 is a\ncollection of useful changes to an already solid OS\".[181]\n\nIn October 2016, a month after its initial release, 54% of iOS devices were\nrunning iOS 10,[182] a \"slightly slower migration\" than for the release of iOS\n9 in the preceding year, a result speculated by _[MacRumors](/wiki/MacRumors\n\"MacRumors\")_ 's Tim Hardwick as being caused by an early release issue that\ndisabled some devices and may have \"put some [users] off downloading the\nupdate\".[183] User adoption increased to 76% of active devices in January\n2017,[184] 79% in February 2017,[185] 86% in June 2017,[186] 87% in July\n2017,[187] and 89% in September 2017 before the release of [iOS\n11](/wiki/IOS_11 \"IOS 11\").[188]\n\n## Problems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=45 \"Edit\nsection: Problems\")]\n\n### Initial release bricking\nissue[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=46 \"Edit section:\nInitial release bricking issue\")]\n\nThe initial public release of iOS 10 on September 13, 2016 saw many\n[iPhones](/wiki/IPhone \"IPhone\") and [iPads](/wiki/IPad \"IPad\") temporarily\ndisabled, or \"bricked\", by the over-the-air update, requiring bricked devices\nto be connected to a [Mac](/wiki/Macintosh \"Macintosh\") or\n[PC](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\") with [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes\n\"ITunes\") in order to retry the update or restore the device to factory\nsettings. Apple quickly released iOS 10.0.1,[8] and issued a statement: \"We\nexperienced a brief issue with the software update process, affecting a small\nnumber of users during the first hour of availability. The problem was quickly\nresolved and we apologize to those customers.\"[189]\n\n### Local backup encryption\nissue[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=47 \"Edit section:\nLocal backup encryption issue\")]\n\nIn September 2016, it was discovered that the encryption of local iOS backups\nmade with [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\") is weaker for iOS 10 devices than\nfor devices running iOS 9. Russian software firm [ElcomSoft](/wiki/ElcomSoft\n\"ElcomSoft\") discovered that the iOS 10 backup process skips several security\nchecks, making it \"approximately 2,500 times\" faster to try passwords,\nenabling 6 million password tries per second compared to the 2,400 password\ntries per second for the same process ElcomSoft has used on iOS 9. The firm\nstated that the impact is \"severe\".[190] Apple acknowledged the problem, said\nit planned to issue a security update, but also stated that\n[iCloud](/wiki/ICloud \"ICloud\") backups were not affected.[191] The iOS 10.1\nupdate subsequently fixed the issue.[192]\n\n### Battery shutdowns[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IOS_10&action=edit&section=48\n\"Edit section: Battery shutdowns\")]\n\n_The Next Web_ 's Juan Buis wrote in late November 2016 that \"complaints are\nshared [on Apple's support forums] about various iPhone models turning off\nwhen the battery falls below a certain percentage\", and blames the iOS 10.1.1\nupdate. He further wrote that \"the original post [on support forums] explains\nthat the phone dies when there’s 30 percent charge left, and many others have\nsince replied that they’re experiencing the same.\"[193] iOS 10.2, released in\nDecember 2016, adds a [telemetry](/wiki/Telemetry \"Telemetry\") diagnostic tool\nthat Apple can use to report battery consumption, for diagnosing reported\nissues with 30% battery shutdowns.[19] In February 2017, Apple released a\nstatement to _[TechCrunch](/wiki/TechCrunch \"TechCrunch\")_ , saying that the\niOS 10.2.1 update, released on January 23, had reduced the occurrence of\nbattery shutdowns by \"more than 80%\" on [iPhone 6S](/wiki/IPhone_6S \"IPhone\n6S\") devices and \"over 70%\" on [iPhone 6](/wiki/IPhone_6 \"IPhone 6\") devices.\nIn full, the statement read:[194][195][196]\n\n> With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made improvements to reduce occurrences of unexpected\n> shutdowns that a small number of users were experiencing with their iPhone.\n> iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the\n> diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small\n> percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80%\n> reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices\n> unexpectedly shutting down.
