A driving blues-rock boogie,[2] it was adapted from\nearlier blues songs and includes mid-1960s [psychedelic\nrock](/wiki/Psychedelic_rock \"Psychedelic rock\") elements. Unlike most of\nCanned Heat's songs from the period, second guitarist and harmonica player\n[Alan Wilson](/wiki/Alan_Wilson_\\(musician\\) \"Alan Wilson \\(musician\\)\")\nprovides the distinctive [falsetto](/wiki/Falsetto \"Falsetto\") vocal. \"On the\nRoad Again\" first appeared on their second album, _[Boogie with Canned\nHeat](/wiki/Boogie_with_Canned_Heat \"Boogie with Canned Heat\")_ , in January\n1968; when an edited version was released as a single in April 1968, \"On the\nRoad Again\" became Canned Heat's first record chart hit and one of their best-\nknown songs.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Earlier songs\n  * 2 Recording and composition\n  * 3 Personnel\n  * 4 Releases and charts\n  * 5 Influence\n  * 6 Notes\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Earlier\nsongs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=On_the_Road_Again_\\(Canned_Heat_song\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Earlier songs\")]\n\nWith his record company's encouragement, Chicago blues musician [Floyd\nJones](/wiki/Floyd_Jones \"Floyd Jones\") recorded a song titled \"On the Road\nAgain\" in 1953.[3] It was a remake of his successful 1951 song \"Dark Road\".[4]\nBoth songs are based on Mississippi [Delta bluesman](/wiki/Delta_blues \"Delta\nblues\") [Tommy Johnson](/wiki/Tommy_Johnson_\\(blues_musician\\) \"Tommy Johnson\n\\(blues musician\\)\")'s 1928 song \"Big Road Blues\"[5] (Canned Heat took their\nname from Johnson's 1928 song \"Canned Heat Blues\"[6]). Johnson's lyrics\ninclude: \"Well I ain't goin' down that big road by myself ... If I don't carry\nyou gonna carry somebody else\". Jones \"reshaped Tommy Johnson's verses into an\neerie evocation of the Delta\".[7] In \"Dark Road\" he added:\n\n> Whoaa well my mother died and left me  \n>  Ohh when I was quite young, when I was quite young ...  \n>  Said Lord have mercy ooo, on my wicked son\n\nAnd in \"On the Road Again\" he added\n\n> Whoaa I had to travel, whoaa in the rain and snow in the rain and snow  \n>  My baby had quit me ooo (2×)  \n>  Have no place to go\n\nBoth songs share a \"hypnotic one-chord [drone](/wiki/Drone_\\(music\\) \"Drone\n\\(music\\)\") piece\"-arrangement that one-time Floyd Jones musical partner\n[Howlin' Wolf](/wiki/Howlin%27_Wolf \"Howlin' Wolf\") used for his songs \"Crying\nat Daybreak\" and the related \"[Smokestack\nLightning](/wiki/Smokestack_Lightning \"Smokestack Lightning\")\".[7][8]\n\n## Recording and\ncomposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=On_the_Road_Again_\\(Canned_Heat_song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Recording and composition\")]\n\n\"On the Road Again\" was among the first songs Canned Heat recorded as demos in\nApril 1967 at the RCA Studios in Chicago[9] with original drummer [Frank\nCook](/wiki/Frank_Cook_\\(musician\\) \"Frank Cook \\(musician\\)\"). At over seven\nminutes in length, it has the basic elements of the later album version, but\nis two minutes longer with more harmonica and guitar soloing.[b]\n\nDuring the recording for their second album, Canned Heat recorded \"On the Road\nAgain\" with new drummer [Adolfo \"Fito\" de la\nParra](/wiki/Adolfo_%22Fito%22_de_la_Parra \"Adolfo \"Fito\" de la Parra\"). The\nsession took place September 6, 1967, at the Liberty Records studio in Los\nAngeles. Alan Wilson used verses from Floyd Jones' \"On the Road Again\" and\n\"Dark Road\" and added some lines of his own:\n\n> Well I'm so tired of cryin' but I'm out on the road again, I'm on the road\n> again (2×)  \n>  I ain't got no woman just to call my special friend\n\nFor the instrumental accompaniment, Canned Heat uses a \"basic E/G/A blues\nchord pattern\"[10] or \"one-chord boogie riff\" adapted from [John Lee\nHooker](/wiki/John_Lee_Hooker \"John Lee Hooker\")'s 1949 hit \"[Boogie\nChillen'](/wiki/Boogie_Chillen%27 \"Boogie Chillen'\")\".[11] Expanding on Jones'\nhypnotic drone, Wilson used an Eastern string instrument called a\n[tambura](/wiki/Tanbur \"Tanbur\") to give the song a\n[psychedelic](/wiki/Psychedelic_music \"Psychedelic music\") ambience. Although\n[Bob Hite](/wiki/Bob_Hite \"Bob Hite\") was the group's primary vocalist, \"On\nthe Road\" features Wilson as the singer, \"utilizing his best [Skip\nJames](/wiki/Skip_James \"Skip James\")-inspired falsetto vocal\".[10][c] Wilson\nalso provides the harmonica parts.[d]\n\nThe basic riff is used again by Canned Heat on \"Fried Hockey Boogie\", an\neleven-minute boogie by Larry Taylor which showcases the band's musicality\nwith a series of virtuoso solo performances by members.\n\n##\nPersonnel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=On_the_Road_Again_\\(Canned_Heat_song\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Personnel\")]\n\n  * [Alan Wilson](/wiki/Alan_Wilson_\\(musician\\) \"Alan Wilson \\(musician\\)\") – vocal, harmonica, electric guitar, [tambura](/wiki/Tanbur \"Tanbur\")\n  * [Henry Vestine](/wiki/Henry_Vestine \"Henry Vestine\") – electric guitar\n  * [Larry Taylor](/wiki/Larry_Taylor \"Larry Taylor\") – bass guitar\n  * [Adolfo de la Parra](/wiki/Adolfo_de_la_Parra \"Adolfo de la Parra\") – drums\n\n## Releases and\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=On_the_Road_Again_\\(Canned_Heat_song\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Releases and charts\")]\n\n\"On the Road Again\" is included on Canned Heat's second album, _Boogie with\nCanned Heat_ , released January 21, 1968, by Liberty Records. After receiving\nstrong response from airplay on American\n\"[underground](/wiki/Progressive_rock_\\(radio_format\\) \"Progressive rock\n\\(radio format\\)\")\" FM radio, Liberty issued the song as a single on April 24,\n1968.[13] To make the song more Top-40 AM radio-friendly, Liberty edited it\nfrom the original length of 4:55 to a 3:33 single version.
