Edward\nSaunders and John Gore led the meeting from the back of a greengrocer's cart\nin Adelaide Botanic Park with an offer of food for those who had not eaten.[1]\nIn 1883, Major James Barker led the way to establish the first Salvation Army\nsocial institution anywhere in the world on a permanent basis, known as the\n\"Prison Gate\" program. Barker saw that prisoners being released from the\nMelbourne Gaol had nowhere to go and no work, so they inevitably re-offended\nand returned to gaol. Barker leased a small house in Lygon Street, Carlton, to\nprovide accommodation for prisoners discharged from Melbourne's gaols. This\nled to the formation of the Prison-Gate Brigade, the members of which met\ndischarged prisoners upon their release and offered them a home and the\nprospect of a job.[2] The Salvos also involved themselves in finding work for\nthe unemployed and in re-uniting families. In Melbourne from 1897 to 1910, The\nArmy's [Limelight Department](/wiki/Limelight_Department \"Limelight\nDepartment\") was established as Australia's first film production company.[3]\n\nEighty-four cents in every dollar donated to The Salvation Army goes directly\nto those in need.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] This is one of the most efficient[_[peacock\nterm](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Puffery \"Wikipedia:Manual\nof Style/Words to watch\")_] rates of any charity in Australia.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] It is\nthought that the name of the popular biscuit by Arnotts, SAO, stands for\n‘Salvation Army Officer’.[4]\n\nThe Salvation Army helps more than one million Australians every\nyear.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] In an average week, the Salvation Army provides an\nestimated:[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n  * 100,000 meals for the hungry\n  * 2,000 beds for the homeless\n  * 5,000 to 8,000 food vouchers\n  * 1,000 people with assistance in finding employment\n  * Refuge to 500 victims of abuse\n  * Assistance to 500 people addicted to drugs, alcohol or gambling\n  * Several thousand people with counselling\n  * 3,000 elderly people with aged care services\n  * 1,000 people in the court system with chaplaincy services\n  * Family tracing services which locate 40 missing family members\n\nFrom these diverse activities, The Salvos have grown to be one of Australia's\nmost respected charitable organisations, with a 2009 survey by Sweeney\nResearch and the advertising group Grey Global finding the Salvation Army and\nthe nation's Ambulance Service to be Australia's most trusted entities.[5]\n\nAustralia's [George Carpenter](/wiki/George_Carpenter_\\(Salvation_Army\\)\n\"George Carpenter \\(Salvation Army\\)\") was [General of the Salvation\nArmy](/wiki/Generals_of_the_Salvation_Army \"Generals of the Salvation Army\")\n(worldwide leader) from 1939–1946 and [Eva Burrows](/wiki/Eva_Burrows \"Eva\nBurrows\") during the 1980s and 1990s.[6][7]\n\n### Salvation Army Growth 19th\nCentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Salvation_Army_in_Australia&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Salvation Army Growth 19th Century\")]\n\nThe Salvation Army grew quickly within Australia, but it was a growth fraught\nwith difficulty. In its early days The Salvation Army often met with\nsuspicion, derision and violence. Salvationists simply walking down the\nstreets would often suffer abuse and sustain injury from thrown objects.\nSeveral local councils even passed by-laws forbidding Salvation Army street\nprocessions, and the Police were liable to arrest them. From 1881 to 1907,\nacross the country, more than 100 Salvationists were fined or jailed for\nholding street-meetings and marches.\n\n> \"Almost every night some of our soldiers are getting hurt. One night during\n> the week, as we were all having our usual open-air meeting, a crowd of 200\n> roughs gathered around, and threw lumps of road metal. One piece struck the\n> Captain on the mouth and split one of his teeth, and loosened two others;\n> yet, with all, we were able to sing, 'Hallelujah!' \"Another night a sister\n> got struck on the head, almost forcing her to the ground. In the face of\n> all, there are certain officials of the law who stand by and enjoy the\n> brutal sport.\"\n>\n> — War Cry magazine Brisbane circa 1900\n\nDespite persecution and prosecution the number of Salvation Army Corps grew at\nan amazing rate, so much so that by 1900 there were over 1,300 Corps and\noutposts across Australia and New Zealand and The Salvation Army in\nAustralasia could boast the following statistics:[8][9][10]\n\n  * Officers & Cadets & Employees: 1929\n  * Soldiers (Members) estimated at 50,000\n  * Corps (Churches): 512\n  * Outposts: 858\n  * Training Homes: 2\n  * Women's Industrial Homes: 4\n  * Rescue Homes: 16\n  * Maternity Homes: 7\n  * Slum Posts & Women's Shelters: 5\n  * Prison-Gate Brigade Homes: 7\n  * Men's Shelters & Labour Yards: 6\n  * Men's Industrial Homes & Farms: 7\n  * League of Mercy: 4\n  * Military Home: 1\n\n## Australian sex abuse\ncases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Salvation_Army_in_Australia&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Australian sex abuse cases\")]\n\nSee also: [Forgotten Australians](/wiki/Forgotten_Australians \"Forgotten\nAustralians\") and [Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child\nSexual\nAbuse](/wiki/Royal_Commission_into_Institutional_Responses_to_Child_Sexual_Abuse\n\"Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse\")\n\nFrom the 1940s to the 1980s the Salvation Army in Australia sheltered\napproximately 30,000 children. In 2006 the Australian Salvation Army\nacknowledged that sexual abuse may have occurred during this time and issued\nan apology. In it, the Army explicitly rejected a claim, made by a party\nunnamed in the apology, that there were as many as 500 potential\nclaimants.[11]\n\nIn 2013 it was reported that private settlements totalling A$15.5 million had\nbeen made in Victoria relating to 474 abuse cases; a Salvation Army spokesman\nsaid that \"This should not have happened and this was a breach of the trust\nplaced in us\" and that they were \"deeply sorry\" whilst claiming that the abuse\nwas \"the result of individuals and not a culture within the\norganisation.\"[12][13][14]\n\nOn 28 January 2014, the [Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to\nChild Sexual\nAbuse](/wiki/Royal_Commission_into_Institutional_Responses_to_Child_Sexual_Abuse\n\"Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse\"), a\n[royal commission of inquiry](/wiki/Royal_Commission \"Royal Commission\")\ninitiated in 2013 by the [Australian Government](/wiki/Australian_Government\n\"Australian Government\") and supported by all of its\n[state](/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia \"States and territories of\nAustralia\") governments,[15] began an investigation into abuse cases at the\nAlkira Salvation Army Home for Boys at\n[Indooroopilly](/wiki/Indooroopilly,_Queensland \"Indooroopilly, Queensland\");\nthe Riverview Training Farm (also known as Endeavour Training Farm) at\n[Riverview](/wiki/Riverview,_Queensland \"Riverview, Queensland\") – both in\n[Queensland](/wiki/Queensland \"Queensland\"); the Bexley Boys’ Home at\n[Bexley](/wiki/Bexley,_New_South_Wales \"Bexley, New South Wales\"); and the\nGill Memorial Home at [Goulburn](/wiki/Goulburn,_New_South_Wales \"Goulburn,\nNew South Wales\") – both in [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South\nWales\"). The investigation also examined The Salvation Army's processes in\ninvestigating, disciplining, removing and/or transferring anyone accused of,\nor found to have engaged in, child sexual abuse in these\nhomes.[16][17][18][19] On 27 March 2014, the Royal Commission began an\ninvestigation into the handling by The Salvation Army (Eastern Territory) of\nclaims of child sexual abuse between 1993 and 2014.[20][21][22]\n\nMany questions were raised during the course of the investigation as to\nwhether high-ranking members of the organisation knew about these cases of\nchild sexual abuse and failed to investigate, discipline, sack and prosecute\nsex offenders while boys and girls were beaten, bashed and raped.[23]\n\nThe Royal Commission published a case study report on the findings and\nrecommendations for one of the abovementioned case studies.[24]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Salvation_Army_in_Australia&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Christianity in Australia](/wiki/Christianity_in_Australia \"Christianity in Australia\")\n  * [Religion in Australia](/wiki/Religion_in_Australia \"Religion in Australia\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Salvation_Army_in_Australia&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"125 Years in Australia » Our History » About Us\"](http://salvos.org.au/about-us/our-history/125-years-in-australia.php). salvos.org.au.
