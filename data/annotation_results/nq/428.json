They had three children together, two girls and a boy, who are grown.\nJake, who was cheating on Jane, married the much younger Agness ([Lake\nBell](/wiki/Lake_Bell \"Lake Bell\")).\n\nJane and Jake attend their son Luke's graduation from college in [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"). After a dinner together, the two\nbegin an affair, which continues in Santa Barbara. Jane is torn about the\naffair; Jake is not. While Agness has Jake scheduled for regular sessions at a\nfertility clinic, Jake is secretly taking medication to increase sperm count\nfor fertility, a side effect of which can cause dizziness. After one of his\nsessions he has a lunchtime rendezvous with Jane at a hotel. Jake collapses in\nthe hotel room and a doctor is called. The doctor speculates that the reason\nfor Jake's distress may be the medication and says he should stop taking it.\nJake and Jane's children know nothing of the affair, but Harley ([John\nKrasinski](/wiki/John_Krasinski \"John Krasinski\")), who is engaged to their\ndaughter Lauren, spots the pair and the doctor in the hotel, but keeps silent.\n\nAdam ([Steve Martin](/wiki/Steve_Martin \"Steve Martin\")) is an\n[architect](/wiki/Architect \"Architect\") hired to remodel Jane's home. Still\nhealing from a divorce of his own, he begins to fall in love with Jane. On the\nnight of Luke's graduation party in Santa Barbara, Jane invites Adam to the\nparty. She is stoned when he picks her up because she has smoked [a marijuana\njoint](/wiki/Cannabis_\\(drug\\) \"Cannabis \\(drug\\)\") that Jake had given her\nearlier. Before going into the party, Adam smokes some of the joint with Jane.\nOnce inside, they are laughing and happily high, Jake becomes jealous\nobserving them, and after pressing Jane, smokes some with her also.\n\nAgness then observes Jake and Jane dancing together and realizes they are\nhaving an affair. When they leave the party, Adam asks Jane if they could have\nsomething to eat. Jane takes him to her bakery and they make chocolate\n[croissants](/wiki/Croissants \"Croissants\") together. Jake and Agness\nseparate, although it is not clear who leaves whom. Eventually by a\n[webcam](/wiki/Webcam \"Webcam\") in Jane's bedroom, Adam sees Jake naked and\nrealizes that the two have been having an affair. Adam tells Jane he cannot\ncontinue seeing her because it will only lead to heartbreak. Jane's kids also\nfind out, and they are not happy about Mom and Dad getting together again\nbecause they are still recovering from the divorce. Jane tells them she is not\ngetting back with Jake. Jane and Jake talk and end their affair on amicable\nterms. The film ends with Adam at Jane's house ready to commence the\nremodeling. Before the credits roll, Jane and Adam are seen laughing about the\nchocolate croissants while walking into her house.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_Complicated_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Meryl Streep](/wiki/Meryl_Streep \"Meryl Streep\") as Jane Adler, a successful bakery owner.\n  * [Steve Martin](/wiki/Steve_Martin \"Steve Martin\") as Adam Schaffer, Jane's architect.\n  * [Alec Baldwin](/wiki/Alec_Baldwin \"Alec Baldwin\") as Jacob \"Jake\" Adler, Jane's ex-husband.\n  * [Lake Bell](/wiki/Lake_Bell \"Lake Bell\") as Agness Adler, Jake's wife.\n  * [Hunter Parrish](/wiki/Hunter_Parrish \"Hunter Parrish\") as Luke David Adler, Jane and Jake's son.\n  * [Zoe Kazan](/wiki/Zoe_Kazan \"Zoe Kazan\") as Gabby Adler, Jane and Jake's younger daughter.\n  * [Caitlin Fitzgerald](/wiki/Caitlin_Fitzgerald \"Caitlin Fitzgerald\") as Lauren Adler, Jane and Jake's older daughter.\n  * [John Krasinski](/wiki/John_Krasinski \"John Krasinski\") as Harley, Lauren's fiancé.\n  * [Mary Kay Place](/wiki/Mary_Kay_Place \"Mary Kay Place\") as Joanne\n  * [Rita Wilson](/wiki/Rita_Wilson \"Rita Wilson\") as Trisha\n  * [Alexandra Wentworth](/wiki/Alexandra_Wentworth \"Alexandra Wentworth\") as Diane\n  * [James Patrick Stuart](/wiki/James_Patrick_Stuart \"James Patrick Stuart\") as Dr. Moss, the plastic surgeon\n  * [Blanchard Ryan](/wiki/Blanchard_Ryan \"Blanchard Ryan\") as Annalise\n  * Michael Rivera as Eddie\n  * [Robert Curtis Brown](/wiki/Robert_Curtis_Brown \"Robert Curtis Brown\") as Peter\n  * Peter Mackenzie as Dr. Alan, Jane's therapist.\n  * [Rosalie Ward](/wiki/Rosalie_Ward \"Rosalie Ward\") as Alex\n  * [Jimmy Clabots](/wiki/Jimmy_Clabots \"Jimmy Clabots\") as Chase\n  * [Emjay Anthony](/wiki/Emjay_Anthony \"Emjay Anthony\") as Pedro Adler\n  * [Emily Kinney](/wiki/Emily_Kinney \"Emily Kinney\") as Waitress.\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_Complicated_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_Complicated_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Steve_Martin_2011.jpg/170px-\nSteve_Martin_2011.jpg)](/wiki/File:Steve_Martin_2011.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Steve_Martin_2011.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_It 's Complicated_ marked [Steve Martin](/wiki/Steve_Martin \"Steve Martin\")'s\nthird collaboration with director [Nancy Meyers](/wiki/Nancy_Meyers \"Nancy\nMeyers\").\n\nIn May 2008, [Nancy Meyers](/wiki/Nancy_Meyers \"Nancy Meyers\") agreed to a\nproject for [Universal Studios](/wiki/Universal_Studios \"Universal Studios\")\nthat she would write and direct, to be co-produced with [Scott\nRudin](/wiki/Scott_Rudin \"Scott Rudin\").[7] The project was referred to as\n_The Untitled Nancy Meyers Project_ during its inception and early production.\nEstablishing commitments from the principals began in 2008, with [Meryl\nStreep](/wiki/Meryl_Streep \"Meryl Streep\") and [Alec\nBaldwin](/wiki/Alec_Baldwin \"Alec Baldwin\") entering discussions in\nAugust,[8][9] and [Steve Martin](/wiki/Steve_Martin \"Steve Martin\") joining\nthe cast in October.[10] Casting continued through 2009, with [Zoe\nKazan](/wiki/Zoe_Kazan \"Zoe Kazan\"), [Lake Bell](/wiki/Lake_Bell \"Lake Bell\"),\nand [Hunter Parrish](/wiki/Hunter_Parrish \"Hunter Parrish\") joining in\nJanuary,[11] [John Krasinski](/wiki/John_Krasinski \"John Krasinski\") in\nFebruary,[12] [Rita Wilson](/wiki/Rita_Wilson \"Rita Wilson\") in March,[13] and\nCaitlin Fitzgerald in June.[14]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_Complicated_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\nWhile the majority of the film is set in [Santa Barbara,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California \"Santa Barbara, California\"), most\nof the filming – including nearly all of the interiors – took place in [New\nYork City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\").[15] Principal photography\nbegan on February 18, 2009 at the Broadway Stages in the\n[Brooklyn](/wiki/Brooklyn \"Brooklyn\") borough, where the interior scenes of\nJane's house were shot.
