Women's wearing of [low-rise\njeans](/wiki/Low-rise_jeans \"Low-rise jeans\") to reveal their\n[G-string](/wiki/G-string \"G-string\") underwear (the \"[whale\ntail](/wiki/Whale_tail \"Whale tail\")\") is not generally described as\nsagging.[1] A person wearing sagging trousers is sometimes called a\n\"sagger\",[2] and in some countries this practice is known as \"low-\nriding\".[3][4] It has become popular since the popularity of wearing brightly\ncolored and patterned \"[boxer shorts](/wiki/Boxer_shorts \"Boxer\nshorts\")\".[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nSagging first peaked in popularity during the 1990s and remained popular into\nthe mid 2000s, but it has recently made a comeback in the 2010s, with\ncelebrities like [Justin Bieber](/wiki/Justin_Bieber \"Justin Bieber\"), [Liam\nPayne](/wiki/Liam_Payne \"Liam Payne\"), [Ross Lynch](/wiki/Ross_Lynch \"Ross\nLynch\") and more bringing back the fashion trend. Sagging in the 1990s usually\nfocused on baggy trousers with plaid boxers, but in the 2010s sagging has\nbecome popular with skinny jeans and branded boxer-briefs.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Origin\n  * 2 Reaction\n  * 3 Music videos\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Origin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sagging_\\(fashion\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Origin\")]\n\nThe style was popularized by skaters and [hip-hop](/wiki/Hip-hop \"Hip-hop\")\nartists in the 1990s.[5][6] It later became a symbol of freedom and cultural\nawareness among some youths[7] or a symbol of their rejection of the values of\nmainstream society.[8]\n\nIt is often claimed the style originated from the United States prison system\nwhere [belts](/wiki/Belt_\\(clothing\\) \"Belt \\(clothing\\)\") are sometimes\nprohibited[9] and there can be a lack of appropriately sized clothing.[5][10]\n\n##\nReaction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sagging_\\(fashion\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Reaction\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Sagging_crop.jpg/220px-\nSagging_crop.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sagging_crop.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sagging_crop.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTwo male Detroiters sagging their pants in 2007\n\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, many North American local\ngovernments, school systems, transit agencies, and even airlines passed laws\nand regulations against the practice of wearing sagging pants, although no\nstate or federal laws have been enacted banning the practice.[11] US\npresidential candidate [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\"),\nspeaking just before the [2008 US Presidential\nElection](/wiki/United_States_Presidential_Election,_2008 \"United States\nPresidential Election, 2008\"), appeared on [MTV](/wiki/MTV \"MTV\") and said\nthat laws banning the practice of wearing low-slung pants that expose one's\nunderwear were \"a waste of time ... Having said that, brothers should pull up\ntheir pants. You are walking by your mother, your grandmother, your underwear\nis showing. What's wrong with that? Come on. Some people might not want to see\nyour underwear. I'm one of them.\"[12]\n\nIn June 2007 the Town Council of [Delcambre,\nLouisiana](/wiki/Delcambre,_Louisiana \"Delcambre, Louisiana\"), passed an\n[indecent exposure](/wiki/Indecent_exposure \"Indecent exposure\") ordinance,\nwhich prohibited intentionally wearing trousers in such a way as to show\nunderwear.[13] In March 2008 the [Hahira, Georgia](/wiki/Hahira,_Georgia\n\"Hahira, Georgia\") City Council passed a controversial clothing ordinance, in\nthe name of public safety, that bans citizens from wearing pants with top\nbelow the waist that reveal skin or undergarments. The council was split 2–2,\nbut the tie was broken by the mayor.[14]\n\nBenetta Standly, statewide organizer for the [American Civil Liberties\nUnion](/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union \"American Civil Liberties Union\")\nof Georgia stated, \"In Atlanta, we see this as [racial\nprofiling](/wiki/Racial_profiling \"Racial profiling\") ... It's going to target\nAfrican-American male youths. There's a fear with people associating the way\nyou dress with crimes being committed.\"[15] The interim police chief of\n[Flint, Michigan](/wiki/Flint,_Michigan \"Flint, Michigan\") ordered the arrest\nof saggers for disorderly conduct; however, as of August\n2008[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sagging_\\(fashion\\)&action=edit),\nonly warnings had been issued. The local chapter of the ACLU threatened legal\naction in response, saying that sagging did not violate the Flint disorderly\nconduct ordinance[16] and a Florida judge threw out a case brought under a\nsimilar rule, as being unconstitutional.[17]\n\nSagging clothing is a violation of some school dress codes,[3][18][19][20] and\nthe prohibition has been supported in the court system.[21]\n\nTwo weeks after the \"[Pants on the Ground](/wiki/Pants_on_the_Ground \"Pants on\nthe Ground\")\" video became popular thanks to _[American\nIdol](/wiki/American_Idol \"American Idol\")_ (_see below_), a\n[billboard](/wiki/Billboard \"Billboard\") campaign against the style of sagging\npants was launched in the [Dallas, Texas](/wiki/Dallas,_Texas \"Dallas,\nTexas\"), area. The billboards feature [Big Mama\nJoseph](/wiki/Josephine_Joseph_\\(Soul_Food\\) \"Josephine Joseph \\(Soul Food\\)\")\nfrom the 1997 film _[Soul Food](/wiki/Soul_Food_\\(film\\) \"Soul Food\n\\(film\\)\")_ saying, \"Pull 'Em Up!\" and asks youngsters to \"Keep it a secret!\"\nThe campaign is the brainchild of Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine R. Caraway, and\nuses advertising space donated by [Clear Channel Outdoor](/wiki/Clear_Channel\n\"Clear Channel\").[22] Another billboard campaign against sagging pants was\nlaunched in [Brooklyn](/wiki/Brooklyn \"Brooklyn\"), [New\nYork](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New York \\(state\\)\") by New York [State\nSenator](/wiki/State_Senator \"State Senator\") [Eric\nAdams](/wiki/Eric_Adams_\\(politician\\) \"Eric Adams \\(politician\\)\") on March\n28, 2010.[23] In May 2010 New York State Senate President [Malcolm\nSmith](/wiki/Malcolm_Smith_\\(U.S._politician\\) \"Malcolm Smith \\(U.S.\npolitician\\)\") used [US$](/wiki/US$ \"US$\")2,200 from his campaign fund to\nlaunch a similar campaign in [Queens](/wiki/Queens \"Queens\").[24]\n\nAt the [2010 Winter Olympics](/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics \"2010 Winter\nOlympics\") in [Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver \"Vancouver\"), Japanese\n[snowboarder](/wiki/Snowboarding \"Snowboarding\") [Kazuhiro\nKokubo](/wiki/Kazuhiro_Kokubo \"Kazuhiro Kokubo\") was barred from participating\nin the opening ceremonies due to dressing sloppily, including a loosened tie,\nshirt hanging out, and sagging pants.[25]\n\nIn the fall of 2010 at Westside Middle School in [Memphis,\nTennessee](/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee \"Memphis, Tennessee\"), the policy on\nhandling sagging pants is for students to pull them up or get \"Urkeled\", a\nreference to the character [Steve Urkel](/wiki/Steve_Urkel \"Steve Urkel\") of\nthe 1990s television show _[Family Matters](/wiki/Family_Matters \"Family\nMatters\")_. In this practice, teachers would pull their pants up and attach\nthem there using [zip ties](/wiki/Zip_tie \"Zip tie\"). Students would also have\ntheir photo taken and posted on a board in the hallway, for all of their\nclassmates to see. In an interview with [WMC-TV](/wiki/WMC-TV \"WMC-TV\"),\nPrincipal Bobby White stated that the general idea is to fight [pop\nculture](/wiki/Popular_culture \"Popular culture\") with pop culture.[26] One\nteacher at the school claimed to have \"Urkeled\" up to 80 students per week,\nalthough after five weeks students got the message, and the number dropped to\n18.[27]\n\nOn November 23, 2010, [Albany, Georgia](/wiki/Albany,_Georgia \"Albany,\nGeorgia\") passed a city ordinance that banned the wearing of pants or skirts\nwith top more than three inches below the top of the hips, and imposed a fine\nof $25 for the first offense, increasing to up to $250 for subsequent\noffenses. By September 2011, City Attorney Nathan Davis reported that 187\ncitations had been issued and fines of $3,916 collected.[28]\n\nOn December 8, 2010, the city of [Opa-locka, Florida](/wiki/Opa-locka,_Florida\n\"Opa-locka, Florida\") voted unanimously on a $250 fine or 10 hours of\ncommunity service for individuals who did not pull their pants up.[29]\n\nIn [Fort Worth, Texas](/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas \"Fort Worth, Texas\"), the local\ntransportation authority implemented a policy in June 2011 that prohibited any\npassenger from boarding a bus while wearing sagging pants that exposes their\nunderwear or buttocks. Signs were posted on buses saying, \"Pull 'em up or find\nanother ride\", and one City Council member was looking for funds for a\nbillboard campaign. The communications manager for the Fort Worth\nTransportation Authority said that on the first day the policy was enforced,\n50 people were removed from buses for wearing improper pants. Some complained\nabout the policy, but the overall response was positive.[7]\n\nA state law went into effect in [Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\") for the\n2011–2012 school year banning the practice of sagging while at school. Pupils\nfound in violation receive a verbal warning for the first offense, followed by\nparental notification by the principal for the second offense, which will\nrequire the parent to bring a change of clothing to school. Students would\nthen face [in-school suspension](/wiki/Suspension_\\(punishment\\) \"Suspension\n\\(punishment\\)\") for subsequent violations.[30]\n\n[University of New Mexico](/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico \"University of New\nMexico\") football player Deshon Marman was removed from a [U.S.\nAirways](/wiki/U.S._Airways \"U.S. Airways\") flight bound for [Albuquerque, New\nMexico](/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico \"Albuquerque, New Mexico\") for wearing\nsagging pants.[31] A few months later [Green Day](/wiki/Green_Day \"Green Day\")\nsinger [Billie Joe Armstrong](/wiki/Billie_Joe_Armstrong \"Billie Joe\nArmstrong\") was removed from a [Southwest Airlines](/wiki/Southwest_Airlines\n\"Southwest Airlines\") flight from [Oakland](/wiki/Oakland,_California\n\"Oakland, California\") to [Burbank, California](/wiki/Burbank,_California\n\"Burbank, California\") for the same reason.[31]\n\nIn April 2012 Alabama County Circuit Judge John Bush sentenced 20-year-old\nLaMarcus Ramsey to three days in jail for appearing in court with sagging blue\njeans that exposed his underwear, telling him, \"You are in [contempt of\ncourt](/wiki/Contempt_of_court \"Contempt of court\") because you showed your\nbutt in court.\"[32]\n\nOn June 12, 2013, the Town Council of [Wildwood, New\nJersey](/wiki/Wildwood,_New_Jersey \"Wildwood, New Jersey\"), located on the\n[Jersey Shore](/wiki/Jersey_Shore \"Jersey Shore\"), voted unanimously to ban\nsagging pants from the town's boardwalk.[33]\n\nIn [Ocala, FL](/wiki/Ocala,_FL \"Ocala, FL\"), a law was passed against sagging\njeans, violators face a $500 fine or up to six months in jail. Something\nsimilar was done in Wildwood, NJ.[34]\n\nOn July 5, 2016 an ordinance was passed in Timmonsville, SC that punishes\nsagging pants. If the law is violated, offenders could face up to a $600\nfine.[35]\n\n## Music\nvideos[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sagging_\\(fashion\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Music videos\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Travis_Scott_sagging.jpg/220px-\nTravis_Scott_sagging.jpg)](/wiki/File:Travis_Scott_sagging.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Travis_Scott_sagging.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAmerican rapper [Travis Scott](/wiki/Travis_Scott_\\(musician\\) \"Travis Scott\n\\(musician\\)\") sagging his pants while performing in 2015.\n\nSagging has been ridiculed in [music videos](/wiki/Music_video \"Music video\"),\nfirst, in the 1996 song \"Back Pockets on the Floor\" performed by The Green\nBrothers of [Highland Park, Michigan](/wiki/Highland_Park,_Michigan \"Highland\nPark, Michigan\").[36] Another song in 2007 by Dewayne Brown of [Dallas,\nTexas](/wiki/Dallas,_Texas \"Dallas, Texas\") entitled \"Pull Your Pants Up\" has\na similar message.[37] On January 13, 2010, [\"General\" Larry\nPlatt](/wiki/Larry_Platt \"Larry Platt\") performed \"[Pants on the\nGround](/wiki/Pants_on_the_Ground \"Pants on the Ground\")\" during auditions for\nthe ninth season of _[American Idol](/wiki/American_Idol_\\(season_9\\)\n\"American Idol \\(season 9\\)\")_ in [Atlanta, Georgia](/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia\n\"Atlanta, Georgia\").[38] In 2012 a 9-year-old rapper named Amor \"Lilman\"\nArteaga wrote a song titled \"Pull Ya Pants Up,\" and made a music video with an\nappearance by Brooklyn president [Marty Markowitz](/wiki/Marty_Markowitz\n\"Marty Markowitz\").[39]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sagging_\\(fashion\\)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Wide leg jeans](/wiki/Wide_leg_jeans \"Wide leg jeans\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sagging_\\(fashion\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"In Pictures: Sagging Pants\"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/07/in_pictures_sagging_pants/html/1.stm).
