It was during this role as the PAO aboard the _Seahawk_ ,\nthat he first met Lt. [Harmon Rabb](/wiki/Harmon_Rabb \"Harmon Rabb\"), and his\npartner Lt. (j.g.) [Caitlin Pike](/wiki/Caitlin_Pike \"Caitlin Pike\"), when\nthey arrived to investigate a murder; this got him interested in a career in\nlaw, and it was later Lt. (j.g.) [Meg Austin](/wiki/Meg_Austin \"Meg Austin\")\nwho recommended him for transfer to JAG prior to her own transfer from JAG\nstaff. He attended [law school](/wiki/Law_school \"Law school\") in the evenings\nat [George Mason University School of\nLaw](/wiki/George_Mason_University_School_of_Law \"George Mason University\nSchool of Law\") and, upon scoring top grades in his finals, was assigned extra\nlegal responsibilities and acted as a trial counsel for special [courts-\nmartial](/wiki/Court-martial \"Court-martial\"). [Sarah\nMacKenzie](/wiki/Sarah_MacKenzie \"Sarah MacKenzie\") and his wife [Harriet\nSims](/wiki/Harriet_Sims \"Harriet Sims\") are the only people Roberts will\nallow to view his law school grades. He, his younger brother Mikey ([Michael\nBellisario](/wiki/Michael_Bellisario \"Michael Bellisario\")) and sister\nWinifred (Winnie) had a somewhat strained relationship with their father, who\nraised them himself after the death of their mother, due to his physical and\nsometimes abusive methods of disciplining them. Bud's last meeting with LCDR\nRabb prior to his transfer to JAG Headquarters was in the first-season episode\n\"Skeleton Crew,\" when Rabb had been dispatched to investigate the murder of a\nformer Academy classmate (and a love interest).\n\nRoberts is well liked and well respected by everyone at JAG headquarters, and\nis often considered one of the better trial lawyers there. His success rate in\nthe courtroom is often contributed to by his opponents' underestimation of him\nand his abilities. Harm had once said of him, \"Watch out for his _' Aw,\nshucks, I have a lot to learn'_ routine\", alluding to Roberts' ability to\nappear less intelligent than he actually was. After returning to JAG\nheadquarters following the loss of his right leg from a landmine, Bud was\nassigned to working Disability cases; he proved his worth to JAG when he\ninvestigated and successfully turned in a refusal of benefits when he noticed\na sailor damaging his eyes with self-inflicted laser burns. Shortly\nthereafter, Bud returned to full limited duty in the court room.\n\nThough not the physical type, Bud has been known to become so when the\nsituation demands it; he once caught a punch thrown by his father, and was\nable to subdue the larger man without difficulty. The incident where his jaw\nwas broken when he stepped between two simultaneous punches from Rabb and the\nAustralian officer [Lt. Cmdr Mic\nBrumby](/wiki/JAG_characters#Lieutenant_Commander_Michael_.22Mic.22_Brumby.2C_CSC.2C_RAN\n\"JAG characters\") outside of an Australian courtroom had more to do with the\nphysical limitations of the human body than lack of physical prowess. At the\ntime of the taping, actor Patrick Labyorteaux had earlier suffered an accident\nthat had broken his jaw, causing it to be wired shut and producers opted to\nwrite it into the storyline.\n\nLtJG Roberts married Ensign [Harriet Sims](/wiki/Harriet_Sims \"Harriet Sims\")\nin 1998.[1] Together, they had five children:\n\n  * A.J. Roberts (named in the honor of RAdm [A.J. Chegwidden](/wiki/A.J._Chegwidden \"A.J. Chegwidden\"), however not taking his proper first and middle names _Albert Jethro._)\n  * Sarah Roberts (named in the honor of Lt.Col [Sarah MacKenzie](/wiki/Sarah_MacKenzie \"Sarah MacKenzie\")). Unfortunately, the child died due to complications in childbirth.\n  * James Kirk Roberts (named in the honor of Capt [James T. Kirk](/wiki/James_T._Kirk \"James T. Kirk\")). Bud was a big [Star Trek](/wiki/Star_Trek \"Star Trek\") fan.\n  * Unnamed twins (a boy and a girl) born towards the end of the series (the girl is called Nikki in episode \"Straits of Malacca\").\n\nLieutenant Roberts was assigned as Judge Advocate on the USS _Seahawk_ during\nthe beginning of the [War on Terrorism](/wiki/War_on_Terrorism \"War on\nTerrorism\") in 2002. He lost a leg trying to save a boy from a field of\n[landmines](/wiki/Landmine \"Landmine\") in [Afghanistan](/wiki/Afghanistan\n\"Afghanistan\") that year.[2] He was transferred back to JAG HQ after his\noperation and proving that he was still able to meet the fitness requirements\nof the U.S. Navy.\n\nRoberts was promoted to the rank of [Lieutenant\nCommander](/wiki/Lieutenant_Commander \"Lieutenant Commander\") in 2004 in \"Hail\nand Farewell\" Part 1, which was the final act of command of the Judge Advocate\nGeneral, [Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden](/wiki/A.J._Chegwidden \"A.J.\nChegwidden\"), at his dining out. Bud had already been passed over for\npromotion twice, meaning that if he were to be passed over a third time, he\nwould have been involuntarily separated from the Navy.\n\nIn the series' final episode, LCDR Roberts chose to remain at JAG HQ after\nbeing offered billets by [Captain Rabb](/wiki/Harmon_Rabb \"Harmon Rabb\") and\n[Lt.Col MacKenzie](/wiki/Sarah_MacKenzie \"Sarah MacKenzie\").\n\n### On _NCIS_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bud_Roberts&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: On NCIS\")]\n\nBud Roberts also appears in the first season of the _JAG_ spin-off\n_[NCIS](/wiki/NCIS_\\(TV_series\\) \"NCIS \\(TV series\\)\")_ , during his tenure on\n_JAG_ , where [Special Agent Gibbs](/wiki/Leroy_Jethro_Gibbs \"Leroy Jethro\nGibbs\") hopes Roberts will help \"lawyer\" him past a prohibition on the use of\nthe DNA profiles stored by the Department of Defense.[3]\n\nHe then reappears after an absence of more than eleven years in the fourteenth\nseason, having been promoted to Captain and still assigned to JAG\nHeadquarters, where he meets up with [Timothy McGee](/wiki/Timothy_McGee\n\"Timothy McGee\") and assisted the NCIS MCRT in the investigation of the\nhomicide of a fellow JAG officer. McGee asks him about Harm and Mac, but\nRoberts is interrupted by the arrival of NCIS Special Agent Alexandra Quinn\nbefore he can reveal the results of the series' infamous final coin toss.[4]\n\nBud Roberts and AJ Chegwidden (played by [John M.\nJackson](/wiki/John_M._Jackson \"John M. Jackson\")) are thus far the only two\ncharacters from the regular _JAG_ cast who have appeared in _NCIS_ as the same\ncharacter they played in the parent show.\n\n## Dates of rank[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bud_Roberts&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Dates of rank\")]\n\nRank | Date  \n---|---  \n[![US Navy O1 insignia.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/US_Navy_O1_insignia.svg/60px-US_Navy_O1_insignia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:US_Navy_O1_insignia.svg) [Ensign](/wiki/Ensign_\\(rank\\)#United_States \"Ensign \\(rank\\)\") | Original rank from the Pilot episode  \n[![US Navy O2 insignia.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/US_Navy_O2_insignia.svg/60px-US_Navy_O2_insignia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:US_Navy_O2_insignia.svg) [Lieutenant Junior Grade](/wiki/Lieutenant_\\(junior_grade\\) \"Lieutenant \\(junior grade\\)\") | sometime between episode 1.22 _Skeleton Crew_ (unaired) and episode 2.01 _We the People_ (original air date January 3, 1997)  \n[![Lieutenant O3.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Lieutenant_O3.png/60px-Lieutenant_O3.png)](/wiki/File:Lieutenant_O3.png) [Lieutenant](/wiki/Lieutenant_\\(navy\\) \"Lieutenant \\(navy\\)\") | in episode 4.19 _The Adversaries_ (original air date April 13, 1999)  \n[![Lieutenant Commander O4.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Lieutenant_Commander_O4.png/60px-Lieutenant_Commander_O4.png)](/wiki/File:Lieutenant_Commander_O4.png) [Lieutenant Commander](/wiki/Lieutenant_Commander_\\(United_States\\) \"Lieutenant Commander \\(United States\\)\") | in episode 9.23 _Hail and Farewell (Part 1)_ (original air date May 21, 2004)  \n[![Commander O5.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Commander_O5.png/60px-Commander_O5.png)](/wiki/File:Commander_O5.png) [Commander](/wiki/Commander_\\(United_States\\) \"Commander \\(United States\\)\") | (off-camera - not in episodes)  \n[Presumably five or six years after his previous promotion in relation to Time\nIn Rank/Eligibility to be\npromoted](/wiki/Defense_Officer_Personnel_Management_Act#Rules_governing_promotion\n\"Defense Officer Personnel Management Act\").  \n[![Captain O6.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Captain_O6.png/60px-Captain_O6.png)](/wiki/File:Captain_O6.png) [Captain](/wiki/Captain_\\(United_States_O-6\\) \"Captain \\(United States O-6\\)\") | prior to his appearance in _NCIS_ 's fourteenth season.

right leg.\n\n## Nuclear\nFootball[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bud_Roberts&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Nuclear Football\")]\n\nIn one episode, Lieutenant Roberts was selected to carry the [nuclear\nfootball](/wiki/Nuclear_football \"Nuclear football\"). He had trepidations\nabout this duty, as he was worried that he would be responsible for the deaths\nof many innocent people. While he was on duty as the Military Aide to the\nWhite House, the President whose \"nuclear football\" he was guarding ([George\nW. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\")) attended a conference. During\nthis conference, Bud had to go to the bathroom. When he reemerges, the\nPresident is gone. Bud then runs the three miles to the White House with the\n40 pound nuclear football. This closely resembles a real event, when President\n[Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\") once left a meeting in such\nhaste that he left behind his military aide, who then ran to the White House.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bud_Roberts&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ \"Wedding Bell Blues\". _[JAG](/wiki/JAG_\\(TV_series\\) \"JAG \\(TV series\\)\")_.
