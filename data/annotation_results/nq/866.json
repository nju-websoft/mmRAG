John is the father\nof [Sam](/wiki/Sam_Winchester \"Sam Winchester\") and [Dean\nWinchester](/wiki/Dean_Winchester \"Dean Winchester\"), the show's protagonists.\n\nSeeking revenge after his wife\n[Mary](/wiki/Characters_of_Supernatural#Mary_Winchester \"Characters of\nSupernatural\") was killed by the demon [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel_\\(Supernatural\\)\n\"Azazel \\(Supernatural\\)\"), John Winchester became a hunter and raised his two\nsons to fight the supernatural. John disappears early in _Supernatural_ , and\nthe first season revolves primarily around Sam and Dean trying to find him.\nMorgan was also filming episodes of _[Grey's Anatomy](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy\n\"Grey's Anatomy\")_ while the first season of _Supernatural_ was under\nproduction, and future appearances of the character were hindered by his busy\nschedule. While Morgan's portrayal has been praised, fans and critics were\ngenerally frustrated at the character for keeping so many secrets.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Characterization\n  * 3 Development\n  * 4 Reception\n  * 5 References\n    * 5.1 Bibliography\n    * 5.2 Footnotes\n\n##\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Winchester_\\(Supernatural\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nThe father of series protagonists [Sam](/wiki/Sam_Winchester \"Sam Winchester\")\nand [Dean Winchester](/wiki/Dean_Winchester \"Dean Winchester\"), John\nWinchester first appears in the [pilot episode](/wiki/Pilot_\\(Supernatural\\)\n\"Pilot \\(Supernatural\\)\") of the series, but plot devices such as flashbacks\nand time travel detail his background in later seasons. Apparently abandoned\nby his father at a young age—his father actually died while serving a secret\norder known as the Men of Letters—John Winchester grew up hating the man.[3]\nJohn left high school to join the [Marine Corps](/wiki/Marine_Corps \"Marine\nCorps\"), eventually attaining the rank of corporal and receiving many medals\nfor his service in [Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\"). After leaving\nthe service, he found a job as a mechanic, and fell in love with [Mary\nCampbell](/wiki/Characters_of_Supernatural#Mary_Winchester \"Characters of\nSupernatural\").[4]\n\nIn the fourth season episode \"In the Beginning,\" Dean is sent back through\ntime by the angel [Castiel](/wiki/Castiel_\\(Supernatural\\) \"Castiel\n\\(Supernatural\\)\"). Dean meets his parents' former selves, and ends up\nconvincing John to buy the 67 Chevy Impala that he eventually inherits. Dean\nlater watches John being killed by [Azazel](/wiki/Azazel_\\(Supernatural\\)\n\"Azazel \\(Supernatural\\)\"), though the demon then resurrects him in exchange\nfor Mary's permission to enter her house in ten years.[5] When the angel [Anna\nMilton](/wiki/Anna_Milton \"Anna Milton\") travels back in time in the fifth\nseason episode \"The Song Remains the Same\" to prevent the births of Sam and\nDean, John agrees to serve as a temporary vessel for the archangel\n[Michael](/wiki/Michael_\\(archangel\\) \"Michael \\(archangel\\)\") to stop her.\nMichael subsequently kills Anna and erases John and Mary's memories of the\nincident.[6]\n\nAzazel later uses his pact with Mary to enter their home in the pilot episode,\nand ultimately kills her.[7] The second season episode \"[All Hell Breaks\nLoose, Part One](/wiki/All_Hell_Breaks_Loose_\\(Supernatural\\) \"All Hell Breaks\nLoose \\(Supernatural\\)\")\" reveals that she had witnessed the demon secretly\nfeeding his blood to Sam.[8] John investigated the incident and learned of the\nexistence of the supernatural. His desire to find and kill Azazel led him to\nbecome a hunter of supernatural creatures.[7] He took his sons with him during\nhis travels, but often left them alone in motels for long periods of time\nduring his hunts,[9][10] leaving Dean with instructions to \"shoot first and\nask questions later\" while watching over Sam.[9]\n\nAs revealed in the [fourth season](/wiki/Supernatural_\\(season_4\\)\n\"Supernatural \\(season 4\\)\") episode \"Jump the Shark,\" John slept with a woman\nhe met while away on a hunt. Learning over a decade later that he had fathered\nher son Adam, John made occasional visits over the years to partake in father-\nson activities with him. He hid the truth from Adam to protect him, and never\nrevealed to him the existence of Sam and Dean, nor vice versa.[11] Meanwhile,\nJohn trained Sam and Dean to become hunters. However, Sam later left this life\nto start anew in college, leading to a fallout between John and his son.[7]\n\nTwenty-two years after Mary's death, John disappears while on a hunt, forcing\nSam and Dean to reunite in an unsuccessful attempt to find him. Sam returns to\nthe life of a hunter after Azazel kills his girlfriend.[7] John reluctantly\nchooses to avoid his sons throughout most of the season while he investigates\nsomething,[12] eventually reuniting with them in the episode \"Shadow.\"\nHowever, the demonic [Meg Masters](/wiki/Meg_Masters \"Meg Masters\") attacks\nthem and reveals that Azazel is after John. After escaping from Meg, the\nbrothers split up from their father to keep him from the\n[demons](/wiki/Demons_\\(Supernatural\\) \"Demons \\(Supernatural\\)\").[13] When\nvampires murder his old mentor and steal the\n[Colt](/wiki/Supernatural_\\(U.S._TV_series\\)#The_Colt \"Supernatural \\(U.S. TV\nseries\\)\")—a mystical gun capable of killing anything—John teams up with Sam\nand Dean in \"Dead Man's Blood\" to retrieve it. Because demons cannot be killed\nby conventional means, they hope that the Colt will be effective against\nAzazel.[14] In response, Meg begins killing the Winchesters' friends in\n\"Salvation,\" and threatens to kill more unless they deliver the Colt. John is\ncaptured after trying to give her a fake gun,[15] and reveals himself to be\npossessed by Azazel when the brothers come to his rescue in the first season\nfinale \"Devil's Trap.\" However, he manages to resist the demon's control.\nDespite John's pleas for Sam to shoot him with the Colt, Sam cannot bring\nhimself to do so and allows Azazel to escape. As the Winchesters flee in\nDean's [Impala](/wiki/Chevrolet_Impala \"Chevrolet Impala\"), a demonically-\npossessed trucker crashes into them.[16]\n\nIn the second season premiere, \"In My Time of Dying,\" Sam and John awake in\nthe hospital with only minor injuries, but a dying Dean is comatose. John\nsecretly summons Azazel, and seems to know what the demon's plans are. He then\nmakes a deal to save Dean, giving up his life, soul, and the Colt.[17] Before\ndying, John instructs Dean to kill Sam should he become evil.[18][19] The\nfourth season episode \"On the Head of a Pin\" reveals that the demon\n[Alastair](/wiki/Alastair_\\(Supernatural\\) \"Alastair \\(Supernatural\\)\")\ntortured John in Hell for over a century, with John refusing the demon's offer\nto stop if he himself would torture someone else.[20] His soul escapes from\nHell in the second season finale \"[All Hell Breaks Loose, Part\n2](/wiki/All_Hell_Breaks_Loose,_Part_2 \"All Hell Breaks Loose, Part 2\")\" when\na gateway to Hell is opened. He saves Dean from Azazel, and distracts the\ndemon by temporarily forcing him out of his host, long enough for Dean to kill\nAzazel with the Colt when he returns to his usual body. John then gives Sam\nand Dean a loving smile before becoming engulfed in a white light.[19]\nHowever, the fifth season episode \"Dark Side of the Moon\" suggests that he\nmight not be in Heaven.[21]\n\n##\nCharacterization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Winchester_\\(Supernatural\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Characterization\")]\n\nActor [Jeffrey Dean Morgan](/wiki/Jeffrey_Dean_Morgan \"Jeffrey Dean Morgan\")\ndeemed John a \"tormented soul,\" [22] motivated by an \"equal combination of\nrevenge and protecting his sons.\" [23] Following the death of their mother,\nSam and Dean became secondary to John's quest of killing the demon\nresponsible, although Morgan believed that this aspect changed once John began\nspending more time with them again.[23] Though he thought that John was not\nthe world's best dad and \"definitely made a lot of mistakes,\" the actor noted\nthat \"he did things, even when they were wrong, for the good of his sons.\"\n[22] John Kubicek of [BuddyTV](/wiki/BuddyTV \"BuddyTV\") felt that this\nreasoning extended to John's decision to hide the truth from Adam to protect\nhim. Kubicek also suggested that John became involved in Adam's life to\nachieve \"some level of normalcy\" as a father, an opportunity he had previously\nlost following the death of Sam and Dean's mother.[24] Overall, Morgan felt\nthat John \"loved those kids more than he loved his own life,\" with the\ncharacter's demonic pact with Azazel serving as \"his way of finding\nredemption.\" [25]\n\nRegarding his portrayal of the character, Morgan commented, \"I played him with\nextra angst. I think what was on the page, what I foresaw—not knowing where it\nwas going, because no one would ever tell me anything—there was always a lot\nmore going on in his head than he was going to show anybody, including his\nsons. Because, indeed, there was a lot more going on.\"[22] Kripke later\nconfirmed this, stating, \"It's our view that John knew everything the\nproducers of the show know. John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal,\nthat won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by\nthe time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all.\"[26]\n\n##\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Winchester_\\(Supernatural\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nIn writing the [pilot episode](/wiki/Pilot_\\(Supernatural\\) \"Pilot\n\\(Supernatural\\)\"), series creator Eric Kripke made several dramatic revisions\nto John's storyline. The first draft of the script had Sam and Dean being\nraised by their aunt and uncle, though this was changed when Kripke realized\nthat the backstory became much less complicated by having John raise them on\nthe road. Another revision had John dying at the end of the episode instead of\nSam's girlfriend [Jessica](/wiki/Jessica_Lee_Moore_\\(Supernatural\\) \"Jessica\nLee Moore \\(Supernatural\\)\").[27] Though he survives in the final version of\nthe pilot, the writers decided halfway through production of the first season\nthat John did have to die,[28] as they believed his separation from his sons\n\"split the show\" by having him away \"doing more interesting things than the\nboys are doing.\"[29] Kripke also felt that John kept Sam and Dean away from\nthe \"front lines\", his death being required to allow the brothers to \"explore,\ninvestigate and confront the yellow-eyed demon directly.\" The writers\ninitially intended for John to die in the car accident in \"Devil's Trap,\" but\nthey ultimately postponed his death to prevent the finale from becoming too\ndark.[30] Following the character's eventual escape from Hell, executive\nproducer Ben Edlund stated that even the writers are unsure of where John's\nsoul ended up.[31]\n\n_[Evil Dead](/wiki/The_Evil_Dead_\\(franchise\\) \"The Evil Dead \\(franchise\\)\")_\n-actor [Bruce Campbell](/wiki/Bruce_Campbell \"Bruce Campbell\") was Kripke's\nfirst choice to portray the character. However, Campbell was unavailable,[32]\nand Jeffrey Dean Morgan eventually received the role. Due to the fact that\nMorgan's scene in the pilot episode takes place 22 years before the series,\nMorgan expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes.[22]\nBeing only 12 years older than [Jensen Ackles](/wiki/Jensen_Ackles \"Jensen\nAckles\"), who portrays the eldest son Dean,[33] Morgan was surprised when he\nwas asked to reprise the role.[22] Ackles and [Jared\nPadalecki](/wiki/Jared_Padalecki \"Jared Padalecki\") often teased him about the\nage difference during filming.[34] Throughout the season, Morgan became\nfrustrated at times due to his character's avoidance of his sons, stating, \"It\npissed off everybody, it pissed off us as actors, it pissed off the audience\nwatching, because none of us really knew where we were gonna go.\" However, he\nreasoned that John's motivation for his actions was due to having knowledge\nthat nobody else had.[23]\n\nDuring production of _Supernatural_ 's first season, Morgan was also working\non the shows _[Weeds](/wiki/Weeds_\\(TV_Series\\) \"Weeds \\(TV Series\\)\")_ and\n_[Grey's Anatomy](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy \"Grey's Anatomy\")_, so he was often\ntraveling back and forth between [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los\nAngeles\") and [Vancouver, British Columbia](/wiki/Vancouver,_British_Columbia\n\"Vancouver, British Columbia\"). This interfered at times with Morgan's acting,\nas he had trouble getting \"Winchester-y enough\" after portraying the nice\ncharacter of [Denny Duquette](/wiki/Denny_Duquette \"Denny Duquette\") on _Grey\n's Anatomy_.[33] Morgan commented, \"I was stuck in Denny-land, where I was\nbeing too nice. Winchester's harder to find. Denny's more me. He's an intense\nguy, John is. And Denny, for a guy who's having trouble living, he's just a\ncharming dude.\"[33] Morgan was at first reluctant to return for _Supernatural\n'_s second season due to his role on _[Grey's Anatomy](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy\n\"Grey's Anatomy\")_.[35] Although he lent his voice for the [third\nseason](/wiki/Supernatural_\\(season_3\\) \"Supernatural \\(season 3\\)\") episode\n\"Long-Distance Call,\" [36] future appearances of Morgan as the character after\nthe second season have been hindered due to the actor's busy schedule.\nNevertheless, both Kripke and writer [Sera Gamble](/wiki/Sera_Gamble \"Sera\nGamble\") have stated that they \"would love to have him back.\"[36][37] The\nscheduling conflict has continued into the [sixth\nseason](/wiki/Supernatural_\\(season_6\\) \"Supernatural \\(season 6\\)\") of\n_Supernatural_ , with executive producer Robert Singer revealing that the\nwriters had considered bringing the character back in the alternate reality\nepisode \"My Heart Will Go On\" instead of [Ellen Harvelle](/wiki/Ellen_Harvelle\n\"Ellen Harvelle\"), but due to concerns that they would not be able to secure\nMorgan's return, they ultimately chose Ellen for the deceased character they\nwould have (temporarily) return in the episode.[38] During the production of\nthe [fifth season](/wiki/Supernatural_\\(season_5\\) \"Supernatural \\(season\n5\\)\"), Morgan had an interview with _MovieWeb_ in which he stated that no one\nfrom the show had contacted him about making another appearance, and expressed\nthe desire to return for at least one more episode in what was then-believed\nto be the show's final season, as he had enjoying working with on-screen sons\n[Jensen Ackles](/wiki/Jensen_Ackles \"Jensen Ackles\") and [Jared\nPadalecki](/wiki/Jared_Padalecki \"Jared Padalecki\") and he felt that John's\nstoryline had ended too soon.[39]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Winchester_\\(Supernatural\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nWhile critics praised Morgan for his performance in the role, their reaction\nto the character has generally been mixed. Don Williams of _BuddyTV_ felt that\nJohn is a \"rather divisive character\", with some fans not understanding John's\nmotivation for keeping his sons in the dark. However, Williams himself found\nthe character to be \"completely fascinating\". He chose \"In My Time of Dying\"\nas the second best episode of the series, mainly because of John's\ncontributions, stating, \"Even if you're not a huge fan of Poppa Winchester, I\nthink it's impossible not to be moved by the final ten minutes of this\nepisode... John's final speech to Dean, where he finally tells his son that\nhe's proud of him, is one hell of a tear-jerker, and both Jeffrey Dean Morgan\nand Jensen Ackles knock that scene out of the park.\"[40] Williams praised Matt\nCohen's performance of a younger version of the character in the time-travel\nepisode \"In the Beginning\", believing that he \"did an excellent job at\nportraying a more innocent John Winchester than we've ever seen before\".[41]\n\nDiana Steenbergen of _IGN_ also criticized John for his lack of explanation,\nfeeling that \"it is not exactly easy to watch John treat Dean and Sam so\ndismissively, especially after they have been nearly killing themselves all\nseason to find him\".[42] However, Steenbergen praised Morgan for his acting,\nwriting, \"Even though he is used sparingly throughout the series, Jeffrey Dean\nMorgan is always effective as John.\"[43] She also felt that he brought\n\"emotional weight\" to the character, allowing the audience to \"feel John's\nweariness, and his resignation that things will most likely not go well\".[44]\nWhile Brian Tallerico of _UGO_ enjoyed Morgan's performance, he was happy that\nthe character was killed off because John's presence made Sam and Dean into\n\"followers\" that were \"merely existing in the wake of their father\". With\ntheir father gone, the brothers are no longer prevented from \"heading up the\nbattle with the other side\".[45]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Winchester_\\(Supernatural\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n###\nBibliography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Winchester_\\(Supernatural\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Bibliography\")]\n\nNicholas Knight (2007). _Supernatural: The Official Companion Season 1_.
