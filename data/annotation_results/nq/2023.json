They and Coppola disagreed over who would play\nseveral characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming was done on\nlocation and completed earlier than scheduled.

Vito's youngest son,\n[Michael](/wiki/Michael_Corleone \"Michael Corleone\"), who was a\n[Marine](/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps \"United States Marine Corps\") during\n[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), introduces his girlfriend,\n[Kay Adams](/wiki/Kay_Adams-Corleone \"Kay Adams-Corleone\"), to his family at\nthe reception. Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and Vito's\n[godson](/wiki/Godparent \"Godparent\"), seeks Vito's help in securing a movie\nrole; Vito dispatches his [consigliere](/wiki/Consigliere \"Consigliere\"), [Tom\nHagen](/wiki/Tom_Hagen \"Tom Hagen\"), to Los Angeles to persuade the obnoxious\nstudio head, Jack Woltz, to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes\nup in bed with the severed head of his prized [stallion](/wiki/Stud_\\(animal\\)\n\"Stud \\(animal\\)\").\n\nShortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo, backed by the\nTattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and\nprotection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a\ndangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines.\nSuspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, [Luca Brasi](/wiki/Luca_Brasi \"Luca\nBrasi\"), to spy on them. However, a Tattaglia button man\n[garrotes](/wiki/Garrote \"Garrote\") Brasi during Brasi's first meeting with\nBruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the\nstreet, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born\n[Sonny](/wiki/Sonny_Corleone \"Sonny Corleone\") in command, Sollozzo pressures\nHagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The\nfamily receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that\nLuca \"sleeps with the fishes.\" Vito survives, and at the hospital Michael\nthwarts another attempt on his father; Michael's jaw is broken by\n[NYPD](/wiki/NYPD \"NYPD\") Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo's bodyguard. Sonny\nretaliates with a [hit](/wiki/Contract_killing \"Contract killing\") on Bruno\nTattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey: on the pretext of\nsettling the dispute, Michael agrees to meet them in a [Bronx](/wiki/The_Bronx\n\"The Bronx\") restaurant. There, retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both\nmen.\n\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities, the [Five\nFamilies](/wiki/Five_Families_\\(The_Godfather\\) \"Five Families \\(The\nGodfather\\)\") erupt in open warfare and Vito's sons fear for their safety.\nMichael takes refuge in [Sicily](/wiki/Sicily \"Sicily\") and\n[Fredo](/wiki/Fredo_Corleone \"Fredo Corleone\") is sheltered by Moe Greene in\n[Las Vegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas_metropolitan_area \"Las Vegas metropolitan area\").\nSonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister\nand threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to\ntheir home, but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with\nsubmachine gun fire. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia\nVitelli, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.\n\nDevastated by Sonny's death, Vito moves to end the feuds. Realizing that the\nTattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don [Emilio\nBarzini](/wiki/Emilio_Barzini \"Emilio Barzini\"), Vito assures the Five\nFamilies that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and\nforgo avenging his son's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home\nto enter the family business and marry Kay, who gives birth to two children by\nthe early 1950s.\n\nWith his father at the end of his career and his brother too weak, Michael\ntakes the family reins, promising his wife the business will be legitimate\nwithin five years. To that end, he insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and\nrelinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a \"wartime consigliere\"; Vito\nagrees Tom should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles\nwith rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's\nstake in the family's casinos, their partner derides the Corleones for being\nrun out of New York; Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under\nGreene's sway.\n\nVito suffers a fatal [heart attack](/wiki/Myocardial_infarction \"Myocardial\ninfarction\"). At the funeral, [Tessio](/wiki/Salvatore_Tessio \"Salvatore\nTessio\"), a Corleone [capo](/wiki/Caporegime \"Caporegime\"), asks Michael to\nmeet with Don Barzini, signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The\nmeeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie’s baby. While\nMichael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins\nmurder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his\ntreachery and Michael extracts Carlo’s confession to his complicity in setting\nup Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo,\n[Clemenza](/wiki/Peter_Clemenza \"Peter Clemenza\"), garrotes Carlo with a wire.\nConnie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the\nkillings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but, when the capos\narrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone, and she watches as they\nclose the door on her.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Cast\")]\n\n[![A screenshot of Michael and Vito Corleone during The\nGodfather](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/TheGodfatherAlPacinoMarlonBrando.jpg/220px-\nTheGodfatherAlPacinoMarlonBrando.jpg)](/wiki/File:TheGodfatherAlPacinoMarlonBrando.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:TheGodfatherAlPacinoMarlonBrando.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAl Pacino as Michael Corleone  \nMarlon Brando as Vito Corleone\n\n  * [Marlon Brando](/wiki/Marlon_Brando \"Marlon Brando\"), in the title role, is [Vito Corleone](/wiki/Vito_Corleone \"Vito Corleone\") (born Vito Andolini), the [Don](/wiki/Crime_boss \"Crime boss\") of the [Corleone crime family](/wiki/Corleone_family \"Corleone family\").

latest film _[The Rain People](/wiki/The_Rain_People\n\"The Rain People\")_.[28][18] Coppola initially turned down the job because he\nfound Puzo's novel sleazy and sensationalist, describing it as

Godfather_\nbefore Coppola agreed.[33] Coppola agreed to receive $125,000 and six percent\nof the gross rentals.[34][35]\n\n#### Coppola and\nParamount[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Coppola and Paramount\")]\n\nBefore _The Godfather_ was in production, Paramount had been going through an\nunsuccessful period.[7] In addition to the failure of _The Brotherhood_ , the\nstudio had usurped their budget for their recent films: _[Darling\nLili](/wiki/Darling_Lili \"Darling Lili\")_ ,[16] _[Paint Your\nWagon](/wiki/Paint_Your_Wagon_\\(film\\) \"Paint Your Wagon \\(film\\)\")_ , and\n_[Waterloo](/wiki/Waterloo_\\(1970_film\\) \"Waterloo \\(1970 film\\)\")_.[7][20]\nThe budget for the film was originally $2.5 million but as the book grew in\npopularity Coppola argued for and ultimately received a larger budget.[N\n2][26][36][38] Paramount executives wanted the movie to be set in then modern-\nday [Kansas City](/wiki/Kansas_City \"Kansas City\") and shot in the studio\nbacklot in order to cut down on costs.[26][16][36] Coppola objected and wanted\nto set the movie in the same time period as its eponymous novel, the 1940s and\n1950s;[26][31][16][32] Coppola's reasons included: Michael Corleone's Marine\nCorps stint, the emergence of corporate America, and America in the years\nafter World War II.[32] The executives eventually agreed to Coppola's wish as\nthe novel became increasingly successful.[36][16] The studio heads\nsubsequently let Coppola film on location in New York City and Sicily.[41]\n\nGulf & Western executive [Charles Bluhdorn](/wiki/Charles_Bluhdorn \"Charles\nBluhdorn\") was frustrated with Coppola over the number of screen tests he had\nperformed without finding a person to play the various roles.[39] Production\nquickly fell behind because of Coppola's indecisiveness and conflicts with\nParamount, which led to costs being around $40,000 per day.[39] With the\nrising costs, Paramount had then Vice President Jack Ballard keep a close eye\non production costs.[42] While filming, Coppola stated that he felt he could\nbe fired at any point as he knew Paramount executives were not happy with many\nof the decisions he had made.[26] Coppola was aware that Evans had asked [Elia\nKazan](/wiki/Elia_Kazan \"Elia Kazan\") to take over directing the film, because\nhe feared that Coppola was too inexperienced to cope with the increased size\nof the production.[43] Coppola was also convinced that the film editor, [Aram\nAvakian](/wiki/Aram_Avakian \"Aram Avakian\"), and the assistant director, Steve\nKestner, were conspiring to get him fired. Avakian complained to Evans that he\ncould not edit the scenes correctly because Coppola was not shooting enough\nfootage. Evans however was satisfied with the footage being sent to the west\ncoast, and authorized Coppola to fire them both. Coppola later explained:\n\"Like the godfather, I fired people as a preemptory strike. The people who\nwere angling the most to have me fired, I had fired.\"[44] Brando threatened\nthat he would quit if Coppola were fired.[26][42]\n\nParamount wanted _The Godfather_ to appeal to a wide audience and threatened\nCoppola with a \"violence coach\" to make the film more exciting. Coppola added\na few more violent scenes to keep the studio happy. The scene in which Connie\nsmashes [crockery](/wiki/Tableware \"Tableware\") after finding out Carlo has\nbeen cheating was added for this reason.[31]\n\n### Writing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Writing\")]\n\nOn April 14, 1970, it was revealed that Puzo was hired by Paramount for\n$100,000, along with a percentage of the film's profits, to work on the\nscreenplay for the film.[45][46][17] Working from the book, Coppola wanted to\nhave the themes of culture, character, power, and family at the forefront of\nthe film, whereas Puzo wanted to retain aspects from his novel[47] and his\ninitial draft of 150 pages was finished on August 10, 1970.[45][46] After\nCoppola was hired as director, both Puzo and Coppola worked on the screenplay,\nbut separately.[48] Puzo worked on his draft in Los Angeles, while Coppola\nwrote his version in [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\").[48]\nCoppola created a book where he tore pages out of Puzo's book and pasted them\ninto the book.[48] There, he made notes about each of the book's fifty scenes,\nwhich related to major themes prevalent in the scene, whether the scene should\nbe included in the film, along with ideas and concepts that could be used when\nfilming to make the film true to Italian culture.[48][42] The two remained in\ncontact while they wrote their respective screenplays and made decisions on\nwhat to include and what to remove for the final version.[48] A second draft\nwas completed on March 1, 1971, and was 173 pages long.[45][49] The final\nscreenplay was finished on March 29, 1971,[46] wound up being 163 pages\nlong,[48][45] 40 pages over what Paramount had asked for.[50] When filming,\nCoppola referred to the notebook he had created over the final draft of the\nscreenplay.[48][42] Screenwriter [Robert Towne](/wiki/Robert_Towne \"Robert\nTowne\") did uncredited work on the script, particularly on the Pacino-Brando\ngarden scene.[51] Despite finishing the third draft, some scenes in the film\nwere still not written yet and were written during production.[52]\n\nThe Italian-American Civil Rights League wanted all uses of the words \"mafia\"\nand \"Cosa Nostra\" to be removed from the script, in addition to feeling that\nthe film emphasized stereotypes about Italian-Americans.[14][53][54][55] The\nleague also requested that all the money earned from the premiere be donated\nto the league's fund to build a new hospital.[54][55] Coppola claimed that\nPuzo's screenplay only contained two instances of the word \"mafia\" being used,\nwhile \"Cosa Nostra\" was not used at all.[54][55] Those two uses were removed\nand replaced with other terms, which Coppola felt did not change the story at\nall.[54][55] The league eventually gave its support for the script.[54][55]\n\n### Casting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Al_Pacino_-\n_Hummel.jpg/220px-Al_Pacino_-_Hummel.jpg)](/wiki/File:Al_Pacino_-_Hummel.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Al_Pacino_-_Hummel.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Al Pacino](/wiki/Al_Pacino \"Al Pacino\") (pictured above in _[The Basic\nTraining of Pavlo Hummel](/wiki/The_Basic_Training_of_Pavlo_Hummel \"The Basic\nTraining of Pavlo Hummel\")_) was chosen to portray [Michael\nCorleone](/wiki/Michael_Corleone \"Michael Corleone\")\n\nPuzo was first to show interest in having [Marlon Brando](/wiki/Marlon_Brando\n\"Marlon Brando\") portray Don Vito Corleone by sending a letter to Brando in\nwhich he stated Brando was the \"only actor who can play the Godfather.\"[56]\nDespite Puzo's wishes, the executives at Paramount were against having Brando\nplay the part due to the poor success of his recent films and his short\ntemper.[57][36] Coppola favored Brando or [Laurence\nOlivier](/wiki/Laurence_Olivier \"Laurence Olivier\") for the role,[58][59] but\nOlivier's agent refused the role claiming Olivier was sick;[60] however,\nOlivier went on to star in _[Sleuth](/wiki/Sleuth_\\(1972_film\\) \"Sleuth \\(1972\nfilm\\)\")_ later that year.[59] The studio mainly pushed for [Ernest\nBorgnine](/wiki/Ernest_Borgnine \"Ernest Borgnine\") to receive the part.[58]\nOther considerations were [George C.

that, when coupled\nwith pressure from the mafia who felt Martino deserved the role, led Damone to\nquit as Fontane.[18] Either way, the part of Johnny Fontane ended up with\nMartino.[18][72]\n\n[![A picture of James\nCaan.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/James_Caan_%281976%29.jpg/220px-\nJames_Caan_%281976%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:James_Caan_\\(1976\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:James_Caan_\\(1976\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[James Caan](/wiki/James_Caan \"James Caan\") (pictured in 1976) was chosen to\nplay [Sonny Corleone](/wiki/Sonny_Corleone \"Sonny Corleone\")\n\n[Robert De Niro](/wiki/Robert_De_Niro \"Robert De Niro\") originally was given\nthe part of Paulie Gatto.[73][63] A spot in _[The Gang That Couldn't Shoot\nStraight](/wiki/The_Gang_That_Couldn%27t_Shoot_Straight_\\(film\\) \"The Gang\nThat Couldn't Shoot Straight \\(film\\)\")_ opened up after Al Pacino quit the\nproject in favor of _The Godfather_ , which led De Niro to audition for the\nrole and leave _The Godfather_ after receiving the part.[73][74] After De Niro\nquit, [Johnny Martino](/wiki/Johnny_Martino \"Johnny Martino\") was given the\nrole of Gatto.[18] Coppola cast [Diane Keaton](/wiki/Diane_Keaton \"Diane\nKeaton\") for the role of Kay Adams due to her reputation for being\n[eccentric](/wiki/Eccentricity_\\(behavior\\) \"Eccentricity \\(behavior\\)\").[75]\n[John Cazale](/wiki/John_Cazale \"John Cazale\") was given the part of Fredo\nCorleone after Coppola saw him perform in an Off Broadway production.[75]\n[Gianni Russo](/wiki/Gianni_Russo \"Gianni Russo\") was given the role of Carlo\nRizzi after he was asked to perform a screen test in which he acted out the\nfight between Rizzi and Connie.[76]\n\nNearing the start of filming on March 29, [Michael\nCorleone](/wiki/Michael_Corleone \"Michael Corleone\") had yet to be cast.[77]\nParamount executives wanted a popular actor, either [Warren\nBeatty](/wiki/Warren_Beatty \"Warren Beatty\") or [Robert\nRedford](/wiki/Robert_Redford \"Robert Redford\").[78][63][79] Producer Robert\nEvans wanted [Ryan O'Neal](/wiki/Ryan_O%27Neal \"Ryan O'Neal\") to receive the\nrole in part due to his recent success in _[Love\nStory](/wiki/Love_Story_\\(1970_film\\) \"Love Story \\(1970 film\\)\")_.[79][80]\nPacino was Coppola's favorite for the role as he could picture him roaming the\nSicilian countryside, and wanted an unknown actor who looked like an Italian-\nAmerican.[31][79][80] However, Paramount executives found Pacino to be too\nshort to play Michael.[14][18] [Dustin Hoffman](/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman \"Dustin\nHoffman\"), [Martin Sheen](/wiki/Martin_Sheen \"Martin Sheen\"), and [James\nCaan](/wiki/James_Caan \"James Caan\") also auditioned.[75] Caan was well\nreceived by the Paramount executives and was given the part of Michael\ninitially, while the role of [Sonny Corleone](/wiki/Sonny_Corleone \"Sonny\nCorleone\") was awarded to [Carmine Caridi](/wiki/Carmine_Caridi \"Carmine\nCaridi\").[18] Coppola still pushed for Pacino to play Michael after the fact\nand Evans eventually conceded, allowing Pacino to have the role of Michael as\nlong as Caan played Sonny.[81] Evans preferred Caan over Caridi because Caan\nwas seven inches shorter than Caridi, which was much closer to Pacino's\nheight.[18] Despite agreeing to play Michael Corleone, Pacino was contracted\nto star in MGM's _The Gang That Couldn 't Shoot Straight_, but the two studios\nagreed on a settlement and Pacino was signed by Paramount three weeks before\nshooting began.[82]\n\nCoppola gave several roles in the film to family members.[18] He gave his\nsister, [Talia Shire](/wiki/Talia_Shire \"Talia Shire\"), the role of Connie\nCorleone.[83][84] His daughter [Sofia](/wiki/Sofia_Coppola \"Sofia Coppola\")\nplayed Michael Francis Rizzi, Connie's and Carlo's newborn son.[18][85]\n[Carmine Coppola](/wiki/Carmine_Coppola \"Carmine Coppola\"), his father,\nappeared in the film as an extra playing a piano during a scene.[86] Coppola's\nwife, mother, and two sons all appeared as extras in the picture.[18] Several\nsmaller roles, like [Luca Brasi](/wiki/Luca_Brasi \"Luca Brasi\"), were cast\nafter the filming had started.[87]\n\n### Filming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\nBefore the filming began, the cast received a two-week period for rehearsal,\nwhich included a dinner where each actor and actress had to assume character\nfor its duration.[88] Filming was scheduled to begin on March 29, 1971, with\nthe scene between Michael Corleone and Kay Adams as they leave [Best &\nCo.](/wiki/Best_%26_Co. \"Best & Co.\") in New York City after shopping for\nChristmas gifts.[89][90] The weather on March 23 predicted snow flurries,\nwhich caused Ruddy to move the filming date forward;

and is seen as one of the most\ninfluential films of all time, particularly in the\n[gangster](/wiki/Gangster_film \"Gangster film\") genre.[140][141] On [Rotten\nTomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\"), the film has a 99% rating\nbased on 85 reviews with an average rating of 9.2/10 and the site's critical\nconsensus reads, \" One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial\nsuccesses, _The Godfather_ gets everything right; not only did the movie\ntranscend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American\ncinema\".[142] [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\") assigned the film an\naverage score of 100% based on 14 reviews from mainstream critics, considered\nto be \"universal acclaim\".[141] The film is ranked at the top of\n[Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\")'s top 100 list,[143] and is ranked\n7th on [Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\")' all-time\nbest list (100% \"Certified Fresh\").[144]\n\n[Roger Ebert](/wiki/Roger_Ebert \"Roger Ebert\") of the _[Chicago Sun\nTimes](/wiki/Chicago_Sun_Times \"Chicago Sun Times\")_ praised Coppola's efforts\nto follow the storyline of the eponymous novel, the choice to set the film in\nthe same time as the novel, and the film's ability to \"absorb\" the viewer over\nits three-hour run time.[145] While Ebert was mainly positive, he criticized\nBrando's performance, saying his movements lacked \"precision\" and his voice\nwas \"wheezy.\"[145] The _[Chicago Tribune](/wiki/Chicago_Tribune \"Chicago\nTribune\")'_s [Gene Siskel](/wiki/Gene_Siskel \"Gene Siskel\") gave the film four\nout of four stars, commenting that it was \"very good.\"[146] _[The Village\nVoice](/wiki/The_Village_Voice \"The Village Voice\")_ 's Andrew Sarris believed\nBrando portrayed Vito Corleone well and that his character dominated each\nscene it appeared in, but felt Puzo and Coppola had the character of Michael\nCorleone too focused on revenge.[147] In addition, Sarris stated that Richard\nCastellano, Robert Duvall, and James Caan were good in their respective\nroles.[147]\n\nDesson Howe of _[The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The\nWashington Post\")_ called the film a \"jewel\" and wrote that Coppola deserves\nmost of the credit for the film.[148] Writing for _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ , [Vincent\nCanby](/wiki/Vincent_Canby \"Vincent Canby\") felt that Coppola had created one\nof the \"most brutal and moving chronicles of American life\" and went on to say\nthat it \"transcends its immediate milieu and genre.\"[149] Director [Stanley\nKubrick](/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick \"Stanley Kubrick\") thought the film had the\nbest cast ever and could be the best movie ever made.[150] [Stanley\nKauffmann](/wiki/Stanley_Kauffmann \"Stanley Kauffmann\") of _The New Republic_\nwrote negatively of the film in a contemporary review, claiming that Pacino\n\"rattles around in a part too demanding for him,\" while also criticizing\nBrando's make-up and Rota's score.[151]\n\nPrevious mafia films had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an\noutraged outsider.[152] In contrast, _The Godfather_ presents the gangster's\nperspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society.[152] Although the\nCorleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict\nprostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering.[153]\nSome critics argue that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for\nunapologetic gender stereotyping, and is an important part of the film's\nappeal (\"You can act like a man!\", Don Vito tells a weepy Johnny\nFontane).[154]\n\nRemarking on the fortieth anniversary of the film's release, film critic [John\nPodhoretz](/wiki/John_Podhoretz \"John Podhoretz\") praised _The Godfather_ as\n\"arguably _the_ great American work of popular art\" and \"the summa of all\ngreat moviemaking before it\".[155] Two years before, [Roger\nEbert](/wiki/Roger_Ebert \"Roger Ebert\") wrote in his journal that it \"comes\nclosest to being a film everyone agrees... is unquestionably great.\"[156]\n\n### Accolades[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Accolades\")]\n\n_The Godfather_ was nominated for seven awards at the

_The\nGodfather_](/wiki/Speak_Softly_Love_\\(Love_Theme_from_The_Godfather\\) \"Speak\nSoftly Love \\(Love Theme from The Godfather\\)\"), the Academy found that Rota\nhad used a similar score in [Eduardo De Filippo](/wiki/Eduardo_De_Filippo\n\"Eduardo De Filippo\")'s 1958 comedy _[Fortunella](/wiki/Fortunella_\\(film\\)\n\"Fortunella \\(film\\)\")_.[166][167][168] This led to re-balloting, where\nmembers of the music branch chose from six films: _The Godfather_ and the five\nfilms that had been on the shortlist for best original dramatic score but did\nnot get nominated. [John Addison](/wiki/John_Addison \"John Addison\")'s score\nfor _Sleuth_ won this new vote, and thus replaced Rota's score on the official\nlist of nominees.[169] Going into the awards ceremony, _The Godfather_ was\nseen as the favorite to take home the most awards.[158] From the nominations\nthat _The Godfather_ had remaining, it only won three of the Academy Awards:\nBest Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture.[165][170]\n\nBrando, who had also not attended the Golden Globes ceremony two months\nearlier,[168][171] boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony and refused to accept\nthe Oscar, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award after\n[George C.

He was insulted at being nominated for the Academy Award for Best\nSupporting Actor award, noting that he had more screen time than his co-star\nand Best Actor winner Brando and thus he should have received an Academy Award\nnomination for Best Actor.[175]\n\n_The Godfather_ had five nominations for awards at the [26th British Academy\nFilm Awards](/wiki/26th_British_Academy_Film_Awards \"26th British Academy Film\nAwards\").[176] The nominees were: Pacino for [Most Promising\nNewcomer](/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Newcomer \"BAFTA Award for Best\nNewcomer\"), Rota for the [Anthony Asquith Award for Film\nMusic](/wiki/Anthony_Asquith_Award_for_Film_Music \"Anthony Asquith Award for\nFilm Music\"), Duvall for [Best Supporting\nActor](/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Supporting_Role \"BAFTA Award for\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role\"), and Brando for [Best\nActor](/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Leading_Role \"BAFTA Award for\nBest Actor in a Leading Role\"), the film's costume designer Anna Hill\nJohnstone for [Best Costume Design](/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Costume_Design\n\"BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design\").[176] All of _The Godfather '_s\nnominations failed to win except for Rota.[176]\n\nAwards and nominations received by _The Godfather_ Award | Category | Nominee | Result  \n---|---|---|---  \n[45th Academy Awards](/wiki/45th_Academy_Awards \"45th Academy Awards\") | [Best Picture](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture \"Academy Award for Best Picture\") | [Albert S.

A comprehensive study of Italian American culture on film,\nconducted from 1996 to 2001 by the Italic Institute of America,[197] showed\nthat close to 300 movies featuring Italian Americans as mobsters (mostly\nfictitious) have been produced since _The Godfather_ , an average of nine per\nyear.[198]\n\n### Popular culture and\nlegacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Popular culture and legacy\")]\n\n_The Godfather_ epic, encompassing the original trilogy and the additional\nfootage Coppola incorporated later, is by now thoroughly integrated into\nAmerican life and, together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, has led\nto a highly stereotyped concept of Italian American culture. The first film\nhad the largest impact and, unlike any film before it, its depiction of\nItalians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th\ncentury is perhaps attributable to the Italian American director, presenting\nhis own understanding of their experience. The films explain through their\naction the integration of fictional Italian American criminals into American\nsociety. Though the story is set in the period of mass immigration to the\nU.S., it is rooted in the specific circumstances of the Corleones, a family\nthat lives outside of the law. Although some critics have refashioned the\nCorleone story into one of universality of immigration, other critics have\nposited that it leads the viewer to identify organized crime with Italian\nAmerican culture. Released in a period of intense national cynicism and self-\ncriticism, the American film struck a chord about the dual identities inherent\nin a nation of immigrants.[199] _The Godfather_ increased Hollywood's negative\nportrayals of immigrant Italians in the aftermath of the film and was a\nrecruiting tool for organized crime.[200]\n\nThe concept of a mafia \"Godfather\" was an invention of Mario Puzo's and the\nfilm's effect was to add the fictional nomenclature to the language.\nSimilarly, Don Vito Corleone's unforgettable \"I'm gonna make him an offer he\ncan't refuse\"—voted the second-most memorable line in cinema history in [AFI's\n100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes](/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Movie_Quotes\n\"AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes\") by the [American Film\nInstitute](/wiki/American_Film_Institute \"American Film Institute\")—was\nadopted by actual gangsters.[201] In the French novel _[Le Père\nGoriot](/wiki/Le_P%C3%A8re_Goriot \"Le Père Goriot\")_ , [Honoré de\nBalzac](/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac \"Honoré de Balzac\") wrote of\n[Vautrin](/wiki/Vautrin \"Vautrin\") telling Eugene: \"In that case I will make\nyou an offer that no one would decline.\"[202]\n\nReal-life gangsters responded enthusiastically to the film, with many of them\nfeeling it was a portrayal of how they were supposed to act.[203] [Salvatore\n\"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano](/wiki/Sammy_Gravano \"Sammy Gravano\"), the former\nunderboss in the [Gambino crime family](/wiki/Gambino_crime_family \"Gambino\ncrime family\"),[204] stated: \"I left the movie stunned ...

Harris](/wiki/Robert_A._Harris \"Robert A.\nHarris\") was hired to oversee the restoration of _The Godfather_ and its two\nsequels, with the film's cinematographer Willis participating in the\nrestoration.[218][219] Work began in November 2006 by repairing the negatives\nso they could go through a digital scanner to produce high resolution 4K\nfiles.[216][217] If a negative were damaged and discolored, work was done\ndigitally to restore it to its original look.[216][217] After a year and a\nhalf of working on the restoration, the project was complete.[217] Paramount\ncalled the finished product _The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration_ and\nreleased it to the public on September 23, 2008, on both DVD and [Blu-ray\nDisc](/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc \"Blu-ray Disc\").[218][219] Dave Kehr of _The New York\nTimes_ believed the restoration brought back the \"golden glow of their\noriginal theatrical screenings\".[218] As a whole, the restoration of the film\nwas well received by critics and Coppola.[216][217][218][219][220] _The\nGodfather: The Coppola Restoration_ contains several new special features that\nplay in high definition, along with additional scenes.[220]\n\n### Video game[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Video game\")]\n\nMain article: [The Godfather (2006 video\ngame)](/wiki/The_Godfather_\\(2006_video_game\\) \"The Godfather \\(2006 video\ngame\\)\")\n\nThe game is based upon this film and tells the story of an original character,\n[Aldo Trapani](/wiki/Aldo_Trapani \"Aldo Trapani\"), whose rise through the\nranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous\noccasions.[221][222] Duvall, Caan, and Brando supplied voiceovers and their\nlikenesses,[223] but Pacino did not.[223] Francis Ford Coppola openly voiced\nhis disapproval of the game.[224]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of American films of 1972](/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_1972 \"List of American films of 1972\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Sources disagree on the date where Paramount confirmed their intentions to make Mario Puzo's novel _The Godfather_ into a feature-length film.
