Liberation War\") in [East Pakistan](/wiki/East_Pakistan \"East\nPakistan\") from 3 December 1971 to the [fall of\nDacca](/wiki/Pakistani_Instrument_of_Surrender \"Pakistani Instrument of\nSurrender\") ([Dhaka](/wiki/Dhaka \"Dhaka\")) on 16 December 1971. The war began\nwith [preemptive aerial strikes](/wiki/Operation_Chengiz_Khan \"Operation\nChengiz Khan\") on 11 [Indian air\nstations](/wiki/List_of_Indian_Air_Force_stations \"List of Indian Air Force\nstations\") that led to the commencement of hostilities with Pakistan and\nIndian entry into the [war of independence](/wiki/Bangladesh_War_of_Liberation\n\"Bangladesh War of Liberation\") in East Pakistan on the side of [Bengali\nnationalist forces](/wiki/Bangladesh_Forces \"Bangladesh Forces\"). Lasting just\n13 days, it is one of the shortest wars in history.[24][25]\n\nDuring the war, Indian and Pakistani militaries simultaneously clashed on the\neastern and western front and ended the war after the [Eastern\nCommand](/wiki/Pakistan_Eastern_Command \"Pakistan Eastern Command\") of\n[Pakistan military](/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces \"Pakistan Armed Forces\")\nsigned the [Instrument of Surrender](/wiki/Instrument_of_Surrender_\\(1971\\)\n\"Instrument of Surrender \\(1971\\)\")[26] on 16 December 1971 in Dhaka, marking\nthe [formation](/wiki/Independence_of_Bangladesh \"Independence of Bangladesh\")\nof East Pakistan as the new nation of [Bangladesh](/wiki/Bangladesh\n\"Bangladesh\"). Officially, East Pakistan had earlier called for its secession\nfrom the [unity](/wiki/Unity,_Faith,_Discipline \"Unity, Faith, Discipline\") of\nPakistan on 26 March 1971. Approximately 90,000[27] to 93,000 Pakistani\nservicemen were [taken prisoners](/wiki/Indo-\nPakistani_War_of_1971_Prisoners_of_War_Investigation \"Indo-Pakistani War of\n1971 Prisoners of War Investigation\") by the [Indian Army](/wiki/Indian_Army\n\"Indian Army\"), which included 79,676 to 81,000 uniformed personnel of the\nPakistan Armed Forces, including some Bengali soldiers who had remained loyal\nto Pakistan.[27][28][29] The remaining 10,324 to 12,500\n[prisoners](/wiki/Prisoner_of_war \"Prisoner of war\") were civilians, either\nfamily members of the military personnel or collaborators\n([razakars](/wiki/Razakar_\\(Pakistan\\) \"Razakar\n\\(Pakistan\\)\")).[27][30][31][32] It is estimated that between 300,000 and\n3,000,000 civilians were killed in

\"Timeline of Bangladesh\nLiberation War\"), and [1971 Bangladesh\ngenocide](/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide \"1971 Bangladesh genocide\")\n\nThe Indo-Pakistani conflict was sparked by the armed liberation struggle that\nwas taking place in [East Pakistan](/wiki/East_Pakistan \"East Pakistan\")\nbetween the dominant [Bengalis](/wiki/Bangladeshi_people \"Bangladeshi people\")\nand the [multi-ethnic](/wiki/Demographics_of_Pakistan \"Demographics of\nPakistan\") West [Pakistanis](/wiki/Pakistani_people \"Pakistani people\") over\nthe issue of [right to governance](/wiki/Right_to_govern \"Right to govern\")\nand the [constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan \"Constitution of\nPakistan\").[43]:24[19] The political tensions between [East\nBengal](/wiki/East_Bengal \"East Bengal\") and West Pakistan had its origin in\nthe times of the [creation of Pakistan](/wiki/Independence_of_Pakistan\n\"Independence of Pakistan\") as a result of the [partition of\nIndia](/wiki/Partition_of_India \"Partition of India\") by the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") in 1947, the popular [language\nmovement](/wiki/Bengali_language_movement \"Bengali language movement\") in\n1950, [mass riots](/wiki/1964_East_Pakistan_riots \"1964 East Pakistan riots\")\nin East Bengal in 1964, and eventually massive protests in 1969 that\neventually led to the resignation of [President](/wiki/President_of_Pakistan\n\"President of Pakistan\") [Ayub Khan](/wiki/Ayub_Khan_\\(President_of_Pakistan\\)\n\"Ayub Khan \\(President of Pakistan\\)\"), who invited [army\nchief](/wiki/Army_Chief_of_Staff_\\(Pakistan\\) \"Army Chief of Staff\n\\(Pakistan\\)\") General [Yahya Khan](/wiki/Yahya_Khan \"Yahya Khan\") to take\nover the [central government](/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan \"Government of\nPakistan\").[44]:xxx The geographical distance between the eastern and western\nwings of Pakistan was vast, as East Pakistan was over 1,000 miles (1,600 km)\naway, which greatly hampered any attempt to integrate the [Bengali\nculture](/wiki/Culture_of_Bangladesh \"Culture of Bangladesh\") with the\n[cultures](/wiki/Culture_of_Pakistan \"Culture of Pakistan\") of West\nPakistan.[45]:13–14[46][_[self-published\nsource](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]:xxi\n\nTo overcome the Bengali domination and prevent them from their right to form\nthe central government in [Islamabad](/wiki/Islamabad \"Islamabad\"), the\ncontroversial [One Unit](/wiki/One_Unit \"One Unit\") program was promulgated\nwhich established the two wings of East and [West\nPakistan](/wiki/West_Pakistan \"West Pakistan\"), but such efforts were met with\ngreat opposition from the West Pakistanis. This made it difficult to\neffectively govern both wings.[44]:xxx In 1969, President Yahya Khan announced\nthe first [general elections](/wiki/Elections_in_Pakistan \"Elections in\nPakistan\") and he [disestablished the status\nof](/wiki/Legal_Framework_Order,_2002 \"Legal Framework Order, 2002\") West\nPakistan as a single province in 1970 in order to restore it to its original\nheterogeneous status comprising [four\nprovinces](/wiki/Four_Provinces_\\(Pakistan\\) \"Four Provinces \\(Pakistan\\)\"),\nas defined at the time of establishment of Pakistan in 1947.[47] In addition,\nthere were also religious and racial tensions between Bengalis and the multi-\nethnic West Pakistanis, as Bengalis looked different from the dominant West\nPakistanis.[43]:24–25\n\nThe [general elections](/wiki/Pakistani_general_election,_1970 \"Pakistani\ngeneral election, 1970\"), held in 1970, resulted in East Pakistan's [Awami\nLeague](/wiki/Awami_League \"Awami League\") gaining 167 out of 169 seats for\nthe [East Pakistan Legislative\nAssembly](/wiki/East_Pakistan_Legislative_Assembly \"East Pakistan Legislative\nAssembly\"), and a near-[absolute majority](/wiki/Supermajority\n\"Supermajority\") in the 313-seat [National\nAssembly](/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Pakistan \"National Assembly of\nPakistan\"), while the [vote](/wiki/Vote_bank \"Vote bank\") in West Pakistan was\nmostly won by the [socialist](/wiki/Socialism_in_Pakistan \"Socialism in\nPakistan\") [Pakistan Peoples Party](/wiki/Pakistan_Peoples_Party \"Pakistan\nPeoples Party\").[48]:686–687 The Awami League leader [Sheikh Mujibur\nRahman](/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman \"Sheikh Mujibur Rahman\") stressed his\npolitical position by presenting his [Six Points](/wiki/Six_point_movement\n\"Six point movement\") and endorsing the Bengalis' right to govern.[44]:xxx The\nAwami League's election success caused many West Pakistanis to fear that it\nwould allow the Bengalis to draft the constitution based on the six-points and\nliberalism.[49]:xlv\n\nTo resolve the crisis, the [Ahsan–Yaqub Mission](/wiki/Admiral_Ahsan_Mission\n\"Admiral Ahsan Mission\") was formed to provide insightful recommendations, and\nits findings were met with favourable reviews from the Awami League, the\nPakistan Peoples Party, and the Pakistan Muslim League as well as from\nPresident Yahya Khan.[50]:109–110\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Historical_Pakistan.gif/250px-\nHistorical_Pakistan.gif)](/wiki/File:Historical_Pakistan.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Historical_Pakistan.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nMaps shows Pakistan and East Pakistan.Distance between East and Pakistan laid\n1,000 miles (1,600 km) of [Indian territory](/wiki/Geography_of_India\n\"Geography of India\").\n\nHowever, the mission was not supported by the elements in the [National\nSecurity Council](/wiki/National_Security_Council_\\(Pakistan\\) \"National\nSecurity Council \\(Pakistan\\)\") and was subsequently vetoed.[50]:110 After\n[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto](/wiki/Zulfikar_Ali_Bhutto \"Zulfikar Ali Bhutto\"), the\nchairman of Pakistan Peoples Party, endorsed the veto and subsequently refused\nto yield the [premiership](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan \"Prime Minister of\nPakistan\") of Pakistan to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Awami League called for\ngeneral strikes in the country.[50]:110 President Yahya Khan postponed the\ninauguration of the National Assembly and this caused a shattering\ndisillusionment to the Awami League and their supporters throughout East\nPakistan.[51] In reaction, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called for general strikes\nthat eventually [shutdown](/wiki/Government_shutdown \"Government shutdown\")\nthe government, and dissidents in the East began targeting the ethnic Bihari\ncommunity which had supported West Pakistan.[52]\n\nIn early March 1971, approximately 300 Biharis were slaughtered in riots by\nBengali mobs in [Chittagong](/wiki/Chittagong \"Chittagong\") alone.[53] The\nGovernment of Pakistan used the \"Bihari massacre'\" to justify its deployment\nof the military in East Pakistan on 25 March, when it initiated its [military\ncrackdown](/wiki/Operation_Searchlight \"Operation Searchlight\").[54]\n[President](/wiki/President_of_Pakistan \"President of Pakistan\") Yahya Khan\nthen called on the military - which was overwhelmingly led by West Pakistanis\n- to suppress dissent in the East, after accepting the resignation of\n[Lieutenant-General](/wiki/Lieutenant_general \"Lieutenant general\") [Yaqub Ali\nKhan](/wiki/Sahabzada_Yaqub_Khan \"Sahabzada Yaqub Khan\"), the chief of staff\nof the [East-Pakistani military](/wiki/Bangladesh_Armed_Forces \"Bangladesh\nArmed Forces\").[55][56]\n\nMass arrests of dissidents began and after several days of strikes and [non-\ncooperation movement](/wiki/Non-cooperation_movement \"Non-cooperation\nmovement\"), the Pakistani military led by [Tikka Khan](/wiki/Tikka_Khan \"Tikka\nKhan\") cracked down on Dhaka on the night of 25 March 1971.

The situation became violent and the systematic\n[targeted killings](/wiki/Targeted_killings_in_Pakistan \"Targeted killings in\nPakistan\") of unarmed multi-ethic Pakistanis living in the East\nstarted.[80]:164 [Vehicle bombings](/wiki/Car_bombings \"Car bombings\") on\ngovernment secretariats became a normal narrative, and [high-profile\nassassinations](/wiki/Abdul_Monem_Khan \"Abdul

and militaristic against East Pakistan\nand India when the Pakistani news media reported the complexity of the\nsituation in the East, though the reactions from Pakistan's news media pundits\nwere mixed.[82][83] By the end of September 1971, an organised\n[propaganda](/wiki/Propaganda \"Propaganda\") campaign, possibly orchestrated by\nelements within the [Government of

Indian\nArmy chief General Sam Manekshaw if he was ready to go to war with\nPakistan.[86][87] According to Manekshaw's own personal account, he refused,\nciting the onset of [monsoon season](/wiki/Monsoon_in_India \"Monsoon in\nIndia\") in East Pakistan and also the fact that the army tanks were in the\nprocess of being refitted.[88] He offered his resignation, which Gandhi\ndeclined.[88] He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him\nto prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it; Gandhi\naccepted his conditions.[89][90] In reality, Gandhi was well aware of the\ndifficulties of a hasty military action, but she needed to get the military's\nviews to satisfy her hawkish colleagues and the public opinion, which were\ncritical of India's restraint.[78]\n\nBy November 1971, the war seemed inevitable and the [Soviet\nUnion](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") reportedly [warned Pakistan against\nthe war](/wiki/Rodionov_message \"Rodionov message\"), which they termed as\n\"suicidal course for Pakistan's unity.\"[91]:part-3 Throughout November 1971,\nthere were thousands of people led by conservative Pakistani politicians who\nmarched in Lahore and across Pakistan, calling for Pakistan to _Crush\nIndia_.[92][93] India responded by starting a massive buildup of the Indian\nArmy on the western borders; the army waited until December, when the drier\nground would have made for easier operations and the\n[Himalayan](/wiki/Himalayas \"Himalayas\") passes would have been closed by\nsnow, preventing any Chinese intervention.[94]:174–175 On 23 November,\nPresident Yahya Khan declared a [state of emergency](/wiki/State_of_emergency\n\"State of emergency\") in all of Pakistan and told his people to prepare for\nwar.[95]\n\nOn the evening of 3 December, at about 5:40 pm,[96] the [Pakistan Air\nForce](/wiki/Pakistan_Air_Force \"Pakistan Air Force\") (PAF) launched surprise\n[pre-emptive strikes](/wiki/Operation_Chengiz_Khan \"Operation Chengiz Khan\")\non eleven airfields in north-western India, including [Agra](/wiki/Agra\n\"Agra\"), which was 300 miles (480 km) from the border.[97]:82–83 At the time\nof this attack the [Taj Mahal](/wiki/Taj_Mahal \"Taj Mahal\") was camouflaged\nwith a forest of twigs and leaves and draped with burlap, because its marble\nglowed like a white beacon in the moonlight.[98]\n\nThis preemptive strikes, known as [Operation Chengiz\nKhan](/wiki/Operation_Chengiz_Khan \"Operation Chengiz Khan\"), were inspired by\nthe success of Israeli [Operation Focus](/wiki/Operation_Focus \"Operation\nFocus\") in the [Arab](/wiki/Arab \"Arab\")–Israeli [Six-Day War](/wiki/Six-\nDay_War \"Six-Day War\"), but unlike the Israeli attack on Arab airbases in 1967\nwhich involved a large number of Israeli planes, Pakistan flew no more than 50\nplanes to India.[97]:82[99]\n\nIn an address to the nation on radio that same evening, Prime Minister Gandhi\nheld that the air strikes were a declaration of war against India[100][101]\nand the [Indian Air Force](/wiki/Indian_Air_Force \"Indian Air Force\") (IAF)\nresponded with initial air strikes that very night.[4] These air strikes were\nexpanded to massive retaliatory air strikes the next morning.[4]\n\nThis marked the official start of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971; Prime\nMinister Gandhi ordered the immediate mobilisation of troops and launched a\nfull-scale invasion of Pakistan.[102]:333 This involved Indian forces in\nmassive [coordinated air](/wiki/East_Pakistan_Air_Operations,_1971 \"East\nPakistan Air Operations, 1971\"), sea and land assaults on Pakistan from all\nfronts.[102]:333 The main Indian objective on the Eastern front was to capture\nDacca, and on the Western front was to prevent Pakistan from entering Indian\nsoil.[96] There was no Indian intention of conducting any major offensive into\nPakistan to dismember it into
