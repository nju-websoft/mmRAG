It was believed at the time that any declaration of war by the\nUnited Kingdom automatically included [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New\nZealand\").\n\nThe total number of New Zealand troops and nurses to serve overseas in\n1914–18, excluding those in British and other [Dominion](/wiki/Dominion\n\"Dominion\") forces, was 100,444, from a population of just over a million.\nForty-two percent of men of military age served in the [New Zealand\nExpeditionary Force](/wiki/New_Zealand_Expeditionary_Force \"New Zealand\nExpeditionary Force\"), fighting in the [Gallipoli\nCampaign](/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign \"Gallipoli Campaign\") and on the [Western\nFront](/wiki/Western_Front_\\(World_War_I\\) \"Western Front \\(World War I\\)\").\n16,697 New Zealanders were [killed](/wiki/Killed_in_action \"Killed in action\")\nand 41,317 were [wounded](/wiki/Wounded_in_action \"Wounded in action\") during\nthe war – a 58 percent [casualty rate](/wiki/Casualty_\\(person\\) \"Casualty\n\\(person\\)\").[1] Approximately a further thousand men died within five years\nof the war's end, as a result of injuries sustained, and 507 died while\ntraining in New Zealand between 1914 and 1918.\n\nThe First World War saw [Māori](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people \"Māori people\")\nsoldiers serve for the first time in a major conflict with the [New Zealand\nArmy](/wiki/New_Zealand_Army \"New Zealand Army\") (although a number had fought\nin the [Second Boer War](/wiki/Second_Boer_War \"Second Boer War\") when New\nZealand recruiters chose to ignore British military policy of the time of\ndisallowing 'native' soldiers). A contingent took part in the [Gallipoli\nCampaign](/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign \"Gallipoli Campaign\"), and later served\nwith distinction on the Western Front as part of the [New Zealand (Māori)\nPioneer Battalion](/wiki/New_Zealand_\\(M%C4%81ori\\)_Pioneer_Battalion \"New\nZealand \\(Māori\\) Pioneer Battalion\"). 2688 [Māori](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people\n\"Māori people\") and 346 [Pacific islanders](/wiki/Pacific_Islander \"Pacific\nIslander\"), including 150 [Niueans](/wiki/Niue \"Niue\"),[2] served with New\nZealand forces in total.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Outbreak of the war\n  * 2 Samoa\n  * 3 Middle East\n    * 3.1 Training in Egypt\n    * 3.2 Gallipoli, Turkey\n    * 3.3 Evacuation from Gallipoli\n    * 3.4 Palestine Campaign\n  * 4 Training in England\n  * 5 Western Front\n  * 6 Other theatres\n  * 7 Recruiting and Conscription\n  * 8 Hospitals\n  * 9 Repatriation\n  * 10 Cemeteries and Memorials\n  * 11 See also\n  * 12 Notes\n  * 13 References\n  * 14 External links\n\n## Outbreak of the\nwar[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Outbreak of the war\")]\n\nUpon the outbreak of the war, the [New Zealand\nGovernment](/wiki/Reform_Government_of_New_Zealand \"Reform Government of New\nZealand\") authorised the raising of the [New Zealand Expeditionary\nForce](/wiki/New_Zealand_Expeditionary_Force \"New Zealand Expeditionary\nForce\") (NZEF) for service overseas.

The\nGovernor of German Samoa, Dr. Erich Schultz, sent a message from the island's\nradio station that no resistance would be offered. The New Zealanders\nproceeded to land at Apia and seized key buildings and facilities without\ninterference. The only opposition encountered was at the radio station, where\nthe equipment was sabotaged by the German operators. Logan officially declared\nGerman Samoa to be under the control of New Zealand the following day, 30\nAugust 1914, in a ceremony at the courthouse in Apia.[9] When _Vizeadmiral_\n([Vice Admiral](/wiki/Vice_Admiral \"Vice Admiral\")) [Maximilian von\nSpee](/wiki/Maximilian_von_Spee \"Maximilian von Spee\"), commander of Germany's\nEast Asia Squadron, learned of the occupation, he hastened to Samoa with the\narmoured cruisers [SMS _Scharnhorst_](/wiki/SMS_Scharnhorst \"SMS Scharnhorst\")\nand [SMS _Gneisenau_](/wiki/SMS_Gneisenau \"SMS Gneisenau\"). Arriving at Apia\non 14 September 1914, the approach of the German ships was observed and the\nNew Zealanders prepared to defend themselves.[10] However, von Spee and his\nships soon departed for [Tahiti](/wiki/Tahiti \"Tahiti\"), with neither side\nopening fire.[11] The SEF remained in Samoa until March 1915 at which time it\nbegan returning to New Zealand, a process completed by the following\nmonth.[12]\n\n## Middle\nEast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Middle East\")]\n\n### Training in\nEgypt[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Training in Egypt\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Anzac_covering_force_landing_April_25_1915.jpg/200px-\nAnzac_covering_force_landing_April_25_1915.jpg)](/wiki/File:Anzac_covering_force_landing_April_25_1915.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Anzac_covering_force_landing_April_25_1915.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMap of the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915\n\nAs early as October 1914 the main body of the NZEF sailed from\n[Wellington](/wiki/Wellington \"Wellington\"). Diverted from their original\ndestination in Europe, the New Zealanders were landed in [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt\n\"Egypt\"), where they helped repulse a [Turkish](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman\nEmpire\") [attack on the Suez Canal](/wiki/Raid_on_the_Suez_Canal \"Raid on the\nSuez Canal\") in February 1915.\n\nThe New Zealand volunteer soldiers remained encamped in Egypt, alongside their\nAustralian comrades, undergoing training prior to being sent to France.\n\n### Gallipoli,\nTurkey[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Gallipoli, Turkey\")]\n\nOn 25 April 1915, as part of the [New Zealand and Australian\nDivision](/wiki/New_Zealand_and_Australian_Division \"New Zealand and\nAustralian Division\"), the New Zealanders [landed at Anzac\nCove](/wiki/Landing_at_Anzac_Cove \"Landing at Anzac Cove\") on the\n[Gallipoli](/wiki/Gallipoli \"Gallipoli\") peninsula, and fought in the\n[Gallipoli Campaign](/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign \"Gallipoli Campaign\") under the\ncommand of British General [Alexander Godley](/wiki/Alexander_Godley\n\"Alexander Godley\"). The combined British Empire and French operation was\nmounted in order to eventually capture the Ottoman capital of\n[Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople \"Constantinople\") (now\n[Istanbul](/wiki/Istanbul \"Istanbul\")). Because of a navigational error, the\nAnzacs came ashore about a mile north of the intended landing point in their\ninitial landing. Instead of facing the expected beach and gentle slope they\nfound themselves at the bottom of steep cliffs, offering the few Turkish\ndefenders an ideal defensive position. Establishing a foothold, the Anzacs\nfound an advance to be impossible. On 30 April 1915, when the first news of\nthe landing reached New Zealand a half-day holiday was declared and impromptu\nservices were held – the origin of the commemorative public holiday, [ANZAC\nDay](/wiki/ANZAC_Day \"ANZAC Day\"), recognised by New Zealand and Australia and\nheld each year on 25 April.[13][14]\n\n### Evacuation from\nGallipoli[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Evacuation from Gallipoli\")]\n\nDespite the blunder at [ANZAC Cove](/wiki/ANZAC_Cove \"ANZAC Cove\"), the New\nZealand soldiers fought valiantly throughout the campaign but it was a failed\nventure overall. The estimated casualties on both sides were 392,000 of whom\n131,000 were killed, with New Zealand casualties of 2,721 dead and 4,852\nwounded. The [Allied forces](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I \"Allies of World War\nI\") eventually evacuated in December 1915 and early January 1916. The\nsignificance of the [Gallipoli Campaign](/wiki/Battle_of_Gallipoli \"Battle of\nGallipoli\") was strongly felt in New Zealand (and Australia) where it was the\nfirst great conflict experienced by the fledgling nation. Before Gallipoli the\ncitizens of New Zealand were confident of the superiority of the [British\nEmpire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") and were proud and eager to\noffer their service. The campaign in Gallipoli shook that confidence.\n\nThe New Zealand Rifle Brigade (less two battalions) had meanwhile reached\nEgypt in November 1915 and was sent into the Egyptian desert to help defeat a\n[Senussi invasion](/wiki/Senussi_Campaign \"Senussi Campaign\") from Libya. The\n1st Battalion fought two brisk but inexpensive actions south-west of\n[Matruh](/wiki/Mersa_Matruh \"Mersa Matruh\") as part of a mixed force\n(including British, Australians, and Indians), one on Christmas Day, the other\non 23 January 1916. Both were successful and broke the back of the invasion.\nIn mid-February the 1st Battalion rejoined the rest of the brigade at Moascar\nin the Suez Canal area.\n\n### Palestine\nCampaign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Palestine Campaign\")]\n\nIn [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt \"Egypt\"), the New Zealand Expeditionary Force was\nreorganised into the New Zealand Mounted Brigade and the [New Zealand\nDivision](/wiki/New_Zealand_Division \"New Zealand Division\") (infantry).\nReinforcements from New Zealand replaced the Australian component of the\ndivision, which embarked for France in April 1916. The New Zealand Mounted\nBrigade, 147 officers and 2,897 other ranks, remained in Egypt as part of the\n[Anzac Mounted Division](/wiki/Anzac_Mounted_Division \"Anzac Mounted\nDivision\"). In April 1916, it was deployed to the [Sinai\nPeninsula](/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula \"Sinai Peninsula\") where it took part in the\nultimately successful [Sinai and Palestine\nCampaign](/wiki/Sinai_and_Palestine_Campaign \"Sinai and Palestine Campaign\")\nagainst the [Turks](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman Empire\"). New Zealanders\nfought in most of the battles leading up to the fall of Jerusalem and the\ndefeat of the Ottoman Army, and were praised for their fighting alongside\ntheir Australian and British comrades. In 1919, Field Marshal [Sir Edmund\nAllenby](/wiki/Edmund_Allenby,_1st_Viscount_Allenby \"Edmund Allenby, 1st\nViscount Allenby\"), said this of the New Zealand soldiers in the Sinai\ncampaign;\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \"Nothing daunted these intrepid fighters: to them nothing was impossible.\"\n\nA total of 17,723 New Zealanders served in this campaign and New Zealand\ncasualties were 640 killed in action and 1,146 wounded.\n\n## Training in\nEngland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Training in England\")]\n\nWhile in England – either freshly arrived from New Zealand or having already\nserved at [Gallipoli](/wiki/Gallipoli \"Gallipoli\") and awaiting transfer to\nthe Western Front – New Zealand troops were stationed at [Sling\nCamp](/wiki/Sling_Camp \"Sling Camp\"), an annexe of [Bulford\nCamp](/wiki/Bulford_Camp \"Bulford Camp\") in [Wiltshire](/wiki/Wiltshire\n\"Wiltshire\"). The troops who were still stationed at the camp at the end of\nthe war created the giant chalk kiwi known as the [Bulford\nKiwi](/wiki/Bulford_Kiwi \"Bulford Kiwi\") whilst waiting to be repatriated.\n\n## Western\nFront[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Western Front\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/New_Zealand_trench_Flers_September_1916.jpg/250px-\nNew_Zealand_trench_Flers_September_1916.jpg)](/wiki/File:New_Zealand_trench_Flers_September_1916.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:New_Zealand_trench_Flers_September_1916.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nInfantry from the 2nd Battalion, Auckland Regiment, New Zealand Division in\nthe Switch Line near Flers, taken some time in September 1916, after the\n[Battle of Flers-Courcelette](/wiki/Battle_of_Flers-Courcelette \"Battle of\nFlers-Courcelette\")\n\nIn France, the New Zealand Division settled in on the stalemated [Western\nFront](/wiki/Western_Front_\\(World_War_I\\) \"Western Front \\(World War I\\)\")\nand their first major trial was during the Battle of the Somme. It took part\nin the Fourth Army's attack on 15 September, under the command of the [British\nXV Corps](/wiki/XV_Corps_\\(United_Kingdom\\) \"XV Corps \\(United Kingdom\\)\"). By\nthe time they were relieved on 4 October, the New Zealanders had advanced\nthree kilometres and captured eight kilometres of enemy front line. 7,048 had\nbecome casualties, of whom 1,560 were killed.\n\nIn June 1917, the New Zealand Division further distinguished itself in the\n[storming of Messines Ridge](/wiki/Battle_of_Messines_\\(1917\\) \"Battle of\nMessines \\(1917\\)\") and the capture of the village of [Messines](/wiki/Mesen\n\"Mesen\"). On 7 June, after the detonation of nearly 500 tons of explosives in\nhuge mines on both sides of the New Zealand sector, the 2nd and 3rd Brigades\nscrambled over the top, in and out of shell holes, and up the battered slopes.\nCarrying the German front line and supports, they were soon into the ruined\nvillage. The 1st Brigade passed through, helped on the left by a solitary\ntank, to the final objective. With prisoners and booty including many guns it\nwas a striking success at no great cost; but the German artillery revived and\nby the time the division was relieved on 9 and 10 June it had lost 3,700 men,\nevenly distributed between the three brigades.\n\nThe New Zealand Division's next major engagement was at\n[Passchendaele](/wiki/Battle_of_Passchendaele \"Battle of Passchendaele\") in\nOctober 1917. The division had been training since the end of August to\novercome the numerous concrete pillboxes in this sector. The first objective\nwas the Gravenstafel Spur, attacked before dawn on 4 October, as part of a\nmajor advance. The 1st and 4th Brigades forestalled a heavy German counter-\nattack, and the supporting artillery barrage inflicted frightful slaughter on\nthe waiting Germans. Crossing this scene of carnage, the 1st and 4th Brigades\ngained their objectives after a hard fight, inflicting exceptionally heavy\nloss on the enemy and capturing much equipment. For such a resounding success\nthe 1,700 New Zealand casualties, though a sad loss, did not in current terms\nseem excessive. But heavy rain turned the countryside into a bog and tragedy\nlay ahead.\n\nA British attack on the ninth on Bellevue Spur and part of the main\nPasschendaele ridge gained a little ground at prohibitive cost. Heavy swathes\nof barbed wire still girdled the hillside, however, and belated and meagre\nheavy artillery made no impression on them, nor on the many pillboxes beyond.\nNew Zealand gunners slaved to breaking point to get only a few guns and\nhowitzers forward, but stable platforms and accurate fire were unattainable.\n\nThe division returned to the attack on 12 October, with the 2nd and 3rd\nBrigades. There was little to encourage the men as they waited overnight in a\nmorass under steady rain. Shelled in their assembly area, some were shelled\nagain by their own guns when the thin barrage opened at 5.25 a.m., and then\nthey led off into a deluge of small-arms fire, speckled with geyser-like\neruptions as shells exploded in the mud. Worst of all was the wire, covered\nwith deadly fire, its few gaps deliberate deathtraps. Some men tried to crawl\nunder it, some threw themselves at it, two got right through and were killed\nin the act of hurling grenades at the loopholes of the nearest pillbox. The\nleft gained 500 yards of slippery slope, the centre 200 heartbreaking yards,\nthe right nothing until the 80-odd occupants of two blockhouses and a trench\nused up all their ammunition. Then they were captured, blockhouses and all, by\ntwo brave and skillful men, sole survivors of two Otago platoons.\n\nFor these small gains, the New Zealanders suffered 640 dead and 2,100 wounded.\nFor the first time the division had failed in a major operation. After this\nfailure, the division continued to hold a sector of the line. The steady drain\nof men while units only held the line was less spectacular, though it made up\nhalf the losses of the division. Here, before withdrawing from the front, 400\nmore men were lost in the 4th Brigade alone.\n\nThe division now had four brigades, making it one of the largest on the\nWestern Front, and was stationed in the [Polygon\nWood](/wiki/Polygon_Wood,_Zonnebeke \"Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke\") area. An attack\nby the 2nd Brigade on 3 December 1917 gained useful ground but failed to\ncapture Polderhoek Chateau. When the division was relieved, on 24 February\n1918, three \"quiet\" months had cost 3,000 men, more than 1,873 of them killed.\n\nAs the Germans launched their great [Spring Offensive](/wiki/Spring_Offensive\n\"Spring Offensive\") of 1918, the New Zealand Division was rushed to stem a\nbreakthrough in the [First Battle of the\nSomme](/wiki/First_Battle_of_the_Somme_\\(1918\\) \"First Battle of the Somme\n\\(1918\\)\"), which threatened [Amiens](/wiki/Amiens \"Amiens\"). The gap was\nbetween the British [IV](/wiki/IV_Corps_\\(United_Kingdom\\) \"IV Corps \\(United\nKingdom\\)\") and [V Corps](/wiki/V_Corps_\\(United_Kingdom\\) \"V Corps \\(United\nKingdom\\)\") in the Ancre Valley. After confused fighting, the New Zealanders\neventually gained the upper hand and soon were counter-attacking advantageous\nland, stabilising the British line. Later in the year, they excelled in the\nopen country fighting that was brought about by the Allied counter-offensive.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Advance-to-\nvictory-1918-1000.jpg/220px-Advance-to-\nvictory-1918-1000.jpg)](/wiki/File:Advance-to-victory-1918-1000.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Advance-to-victory-1918-1000.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe advance of the New Zealand Division – part of the Third Army’s IV Corps –\nduring the 100 Days Offensive.\n\nIn their last action of the war, the division\n[captured](/wiki/Capture_of_Le_Quesnoy_\\(1918\\) \"Capture of Le Quesnoy\n\\(1918\\)\") the ancient fortress ([Vauban](/wiki/Vauban \"Vauban\")-designed)\ntown of [Le Quesnoy](/wiki/Le_Quesnoy \"Le Quesnoy\") in a daring assault on 4\nNovember 1918. The day proved to be the division's most successful of their\nwhole time on the Western Front as they pushed east and advanced ten\nkilometres, capturing 2,000 German soldiers and 60 field guns. The town\noccupied a strategic position in north-eastern France and had been held by the\nGermans since 1914. Although with no specific orders indicating that the town\nneed to be captured with any haste, the New Zealand soldiers were determined\nto and just before midday the first New Zealand troops reached the outer walls\nand scaled them with ladders. Propping the ladders against the precariously\nnarrow inner walls, sections of one New Zealand battalion ascended the walls\nand engaged in hand-to-hand fighting with fleeing German defenders. The few\nthousand strong German garrison surrendered soon after New Zealand soldiers\nentered the town itself.\n\nThe infantry were relieved on the eastern side of the forest at midnight on\n5–6 November and the war ended five days later. The division left the Third\nArmy on 28 November, and marched through Belgium, to entrain at the German\nfrontier for Cologne and take up billets in neighbouring towns as part of the\narmy of occupation. Demobilisation soon started and at Mülheim near Cologne\nthe division was finally disbanded on 25 March 1919.\n\nThe cost of maintaining the division for two and a half years on the Western\nFront was appalling. Altogether some 13,250 New Zealanders died of wounds or\nsickness as a direct result of this campaign, including 50 as prisoners of war\nand more than 700 at home. Another 35,000 were wounded, and 414 prisoners of\nwar were ultimately repatriated. The total casualties therefrom approached\n50,000, well over half the number of those who served in France or Belgium.\n\n## Other\ntheatres[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Other theatres\")]\n\nNew Zealand also contributed to the war at sea. The [New Zealand Naval\nForces](/wiki/New_Zealand_Naval_Forces \"New Zealand Naval Forces\") was a\nDivision of the [Royal Navy](/wiki/Royal_Navy \"Royal Navy\"). Immediately after\nthe start of the war, the cruiser [HMS _Philomel_](/wiki/HMS_Philomel_\\(1890\\)\n\"HMS Philomel \\(1890\\)\"), loaned to New Zealand as a training ship, was\naugmented with 70 New Zealand reservists and sailed with two [Royal\nNavy](/wiki/Royal_Navy \"Royal Navy\") cruisers to escort the New Zealand troops\nsent to occupy German Samoa. Later in 1914 these three ships also escorted the\nNew Zealand Expeditionary Force to Egypt.\n\nFrom January 1915, _Philomel_ patrolled the [Gulf of\nAlexandretta](/wiki/Gulf_of_Alexandretta \"Gulf of Alexandretta\") in the\nEastern Mediterranean, supporting several landings and sustaining three fatal\ncasualties, one being the first New Zealander killed in action in the war. She\nalso took part in the defence of the [Suez Canal](/wiki/Suez_Canal \"Suez\nCanal\"), operations in the [Gulf of Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden \"Gulf of Aden\")\nand patrols in the [Persian Gulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf \"Persian Gulf\"). Although\nrefitting from time to time at [Malta](/wiki/Malta \"Malta\") or\n[Bombay](/wiki/Bombay \"Bombay\") kept her seaworthy, age eventually forced her\nout of the war and in March 1917 she returned to Wellington for a major\noverhaul.\n\nNew Zealand was not subject to any significant direct military threat during\nthe war. Although Germany had plans for naval raids on Australia and New\nZealand, the threat from her Asiatic Squadron did not eventuate, as that force\nmoved across the Pacific before being destroyed at the [Battle of the Falkland\nIslands](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Falkland_Islands \"Battle of the Falkland\nIslands\").\n\nIn June 1917, a German surface raider, the [SMS\n_Wolf_](/wiki/SMS_Wolf_\\(auxiliary_cruiser\\) \"SMS Wolf \\(auxiliary cruiser\\)\")\nentered New Zealand waters. She laid two small minefields in New Zealand\nwaters and sank two merchant ships. One (the _Port Kembla_) off [Farewell\nSpit](/wiki/Farewell_Spit \"Farewell Spit\"), and another (the _Wairuna_) off\nthe [Kermadec Islands](/wiki/Kermadec_Islands \"Kermadec Islands\"). Two fishing\ntrawlers, the [_Nora Niven_](/wiki/Jas_J_Niven_%26_Co \"Jas J Niven & Co\") and\n_Simplon_ , were fitted as minesweepers and took up sweeping duties in these\nareas. Another brief flurry of activity occurred when [Felix von\nLuckner](/wiki/Felix_von_Luckner \"Felix von Luckner\"), imprisoned on Motuihe\nIsland after being captured in the [Society Islands](/wiki/Society_Islands\n\"Society Islands\"), escaped and commandeered a small vessel before being\nrecaptured in the Kermadec Islands.\n\nNew Zealand also contributed a wireless troop to the [Mesopotamian\nCampaign](/wiki/Mesopotamian_Campaign \"Mesopotamian Campaign\"). The Wireless\nTroop was formed in New Zealand and arrived at Basra in April 1916. In\nMesopotamia the New Zealand troop was amalgamated with the [1st Australian\nWireless Signal Squadron](/wiki/1st_Australian_Wireless_Signal_Squadron \"1st\nAustralian Wireless Signal Squadron\"), forming \"C\" Wireless Troop of the Anzac\nSquadron. The troop was much affected by disease, but once in operation was\nattached to the Cavalry Division in the assault on Baghdad. The Wireless Troop\nwas among the first batch of troops to enter the city on 11 March 1917. The\nWireless Troop joined further operations in Mesopotamia and was then moved to\nPersia. In June 1917, the troop was redirected to France, where it was\nabsorbed into the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company.\n\nNew Zealand had no air force of her own during the First World War but several\nhundred New Zealanders served with the [Royal Flying\nCorps](/wiki/Royal_Flying_Corps \"Royal Flying Corps\"), the [Royal Naval Air\nService](/wiki/Royal_Naval_Air_Service \"Royal Naval Air Service\") and the\n[Royal Air Force](/wiki/Royal_Air_Force \"Royal Air Force\").\n\n## Recruiting and\nConscription[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Recruiting and Conscription\")]\n\nWhen the supply of volunteers for reinforcements for the New Zealand\nExpeditionary Force slowed, conscription was introduced, with the first ballot\nheld in Wellington on 16 November 1916.[15] Men between 20 and 45 could be\nconscripted, subject to a medical check and limited rights of objection on\nconscience, family or business grounds.\n\nConscription was extended to Māori for the \"Native Contingent\" in late 1917,\nwith the first \"Māori ballot\" for the Waikato district held in May 1918.[16]\nThere wes resistance in the Waikato (led by [Princess Te\nPuea](/wiki/Princess_Te_Puea \"Princess Te Puea\")) to conscription. By the end\nof the war 552 Māori had been balloted, but no Māori conscripts had been sent\noverseas. And 2,227 Māori served in the war; about 4.5% of the Māori\npopulation or under half of the total contribution per head of the total New\nZealand population.
