Larry is hired at the [American\nMuseum of Natural History](/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History \"American\nMuseum of Natural History\") to replace the retiring [security\nguards](/wiki/Security_guard \"Security guard\") Cecil Fredericks and his\ncolleagues Gus and Reginald. Larry meets the museum’s neurotic curator Dr.\nMcPhee, and [museum docent](/wiki/Museum_docent \"Museum docent\") Rebecca\nHutman, who plans to write a [dissertation](/wiki/Dissertation \"Dissertation\")\non [Sacagawea](/wiki/Sacagawea \"Sacagawea\"). On his first night, Cecil hands\nLarry an instruction manual on what to do in the museum, warning him not to\nlet anything “in or out.”\n\nLarry soon discovers that at night, the museum’s exhibits come to life and\ncause havoc for him. Amongst the lively exhibits are a playful\n_[Tyrannosaurus](/wiki/Tyrannosaurus \"Tyrannosaurus\")_ skeleton named Rexy; a\nmischievous [capuchin monkey](/wiki/Capuchin_monkey \"Capuchin monkey\") named\nDexter who destroys the instructions; the warring factions of\n[cowboys](/wiki/Cowboy \"Cowboy\") and [legionnaires](/wiki/Roman_legion \"Roman\nlegion\") led by Jedediah and General Octavius; violent [Attila the\nHun](/wiki/Attila_the_Hun \"Attila the Hun\"); a talking [Easter Island\nHead](/wiki/Easter_Island_Head \"Easter Island Head\") that desires gum; the\nfire-seeking [neanderthals](/wiki/Neanderthal \"Neanderthal\"); and a wax model\nof [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\"), who is\nin love with Sacagawea.\n\nRoosevelt explains to Larry that the exhibits have come to life every night\nsince the arrival of an Egyptian artifact, the Tablet of Akhmenrah, the\nmummified pharaoh trapped in his sarcophagus. He also explains to Larry that\nas night guard, it is his job to make sure that no exhibit sets foot out of\nthe museum, otherwise they will disintegrate into dust if the sun rises while\nthey are outside. The next day, Cecil advises Larry to research history to\nmake up for the instructions’ destruction. He studies in libraries and from\nRebecca. Larry puts his new knowledge to good use on his second night, but\nsome of his plans backfire and the neanderthals set their exhibit on fire,\nleading to one becoming dust after venturing outside. After having doubts and\nalmost getting fired the next day, Larry offers to introduce Sacagawea to\nRebecca, but she thinks he is mocking her.\n\nOn his third night, Larry brings Nick to the museum to watch the exhibits come\nto life, but they strangely do not. They catch Cecil, Gus, and Reginald\nstealing artifacts, who explain the tablet’s magic has allowed them to feel\nphysically young in their old age, and plot to frame Larry for the theft while\nthey enjoy a happy retirement. Nick activates the tablet, but Cecil steals it,\nlocking Larry and Nick in the Egyptian exhibit. They free Akhmenrah, and rally\nthe exhibits to stop the thieves and retrieve their colleagues who fled out\ninto [Central Park](/wiki/Central_Park \"Central Park\"). Gus and Reginald are\ncaptured, but Cecil escapes by [stagecoach](/wiki/Stagecoach \"Stagecoach\").\n\nLarry and several exhibits give chase, where they stop Cecil and recover the\ntablet, using its magic to escort all of the exhibits back into the museum\nbefore sunrise. Rebecca witnesses this and makes amends with Larry,\nsubsequently introduced to Sacagawea. The next day McPhee fires Larry, but\nwhen they go into the museum, they find it is crowded due to last night’s\nstrange activities, and Larry is rehired. During the credits, Cecil, Gus, and\nReginald were granted mercy by Larry and work as janitors.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Night_at_the_Museum&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n### Humans[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Night_at_the_Museum&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Humans\")]\n\n  * [Ben Stiller](/wiki/Ben_Stiller \"Ben Stiller\") as Larry Daley, a night-shift security guard at the [American Museum of Natural History](/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History \"American Museum of Natural History\") in New York.\n  * [Dick Van Dyke](/wiki/Dick_Van_Dyke \"Dick Van Dyke\") as Cecil Fredericks, a veteran security guard\n  * [Carla Gugino](/wiki/Carla_Gugino \"Carla Gugino\") as Rebecca Hutman, a museum docent\n  * [Mickey Rooney](/wiki/Mickey_Rooney \"Mickey Rooney\") as Gus, a veteran security guard\n  * [Bill Cobbs](/wiki/Bill_Cobbs \"Bill Cobbs\") as Reginald, a veteran security guard\n  * [Jake Cherry](/wiki/Jake_Cherry \"Jake Cherry\") as Nick Daley, Larry's son\n  * [Ricky Gervais](/wiki/Ricky_Gervais \"Ricky Gervais\") as Dr. McPhee, the curator of the Museum of Natural History and Larry's boss\n  * [Kim Raver](/wiki/Kim_Raver \"Kim Raver\") as Erica Daley, Larry's former wife\n  * [Charlie Murphy](/wiki/Charlie_Murphy \"Charlie Murphy\") as the taxi-driver\n  * [Paul Rudd](/wiki/Paul_Rudd \"Paul Rudd\") as Don, Erica's fiancé\n  * [Anne Meara](/wiki/Anne_Meara \"Anne Meara\") as Debbie\n\n###\nExhibits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Night_at_the_Museum&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Exhibits\")]\n\n  * [Robin Williams](/wiki/Robin_Williams \"Robin Williams\") as a wax model of [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\")\n  * [Patrick Gallagher](/wiki/Patrick_Gallagher_\\(actor\\) \"Patrick Gallagher \\(actor\\)\") as a wax model of [Attila the Hun](/wiki/Attila \"Attila\")\n  * [Rami Malek](/wiki/Rami_Malek \"Rami Malek\") as the mummy of Pharaoh Ahkmenrah\n  * [Pierfrancesco Favino](/wiki/Pierfrancesco_Favino \"Pierfrancesco Favino\") as a bronze statue of [Christopher Columbus](/wiki/Christopher_Columbus \"Christopher Columbus\")\n  * [Owen Wilson](/wiki/Owen_Wilson \"Owen Wilson\") as Jedediah, a miniature [cowboy](/wiki/Cowboy \"Cowboy\") figure\n  * [Steve Coogan](/wiki/Steve_Coogan \"Steve Coogan\") as Octavius, a miniature Roman general figure\n  * [Mizuo Peck](/wiki/Mizuo_Peck \"Mizuo Peck\") as a polyurethane model of [Sacagawea](/wiki/Sacagawea \"Sacagawea\")\n  * Kerry van der Griend, Dan Rizzuto, Matthew Harrison, and Jody Racicot as wax models of [neanderthals](/wiki/Neanderthal \"Neanderthal\")\n  * Martin Christopher as a wax model of [Meriwether Lewis](/wiki/Meriwether_Lewis \"Meriwether Lewis\")\n  * Martin Sims as a wax model of [William Clark](/wiki/William_Clark_\\(explorer\\) \"William Clark \\(explorer\\)\")\n  * Randy Lee, Darryl Quon, Gerald Wong, and Paul Chih-Ping Cheng as wax models of the [Huns](/wiki/Huns \"Huns\")\n  * [Brad Garrett](/wiki/Brad_Garrett \"Brad Garrett\") as the voice of the [Easter Island Head](/wiki/Moai \"Moai\")\n  * [Crystal the Monkey](/wiki/Crystal_the_Monkey \"Crystal the Monkey\") as Dexter, a stuffed [capuchin monkey](/wiki/Capuchin_monkey \"Capuchin monkey\")\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Night_at_the_Museum&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nThe building featured in the film, which was constructed on a sound stage in\n[Burnaby](/wiki/Burnaby \"Burnaby\"), [British Columbia](/wiki/British_Columbia\n\"British Columbia\"), is based on the [American Museum of Natural\nHistory](/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History \"American Museum of Natural\nHistory\") in New York City, external shots of which were used in the movie.[2]\n\nTrainers spent several weeks training Crystal, who plays the troublemaking\nmonkey Dexter, to slap and bite Stiller in the film.\n\nRobin Williams' Theodore Roosevelt costume closely resembles that of [John\nWayne](/wiki/John_Wayne \"John Wayne\")'s character in _The Shootist_.[3]\n\nDirector [Shawn Levy](/wiki/Shawn_Levy \"Shawn Levy\") credited Ben Stiller for\nthe ensemble cast: \"When actors hear that Ben Stiller is in a movie they want\nto work with him.
