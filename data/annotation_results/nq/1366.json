It had a separate assembly for\neach of the three estates ([clergy](/wiki/Clergy \"Clergy\"),\n[nobility](/wiki/Nobility \"Nobility\") and [commoners](/wiki/Commoners\n\"Commoners\")), which were called and dismissed by the king.

Certain precedents paved the way for this institution:\nrepresentatives of principal towns had several times been convoked by the\nking, and under [Philip III](/wiki/Philip_III_of_France \"Philip III of\nFrance\") there had been assemblies of nobles and ecclesiastics in which the\ntwo orders deliberated separately. It was the dispute between [Philip the\nFair](/wiki/Philip_IV_of_France \"Philip IV of France\") and [Pope Boniface\nVIII](/wiki/Pope_Boniface_VIII \"Pope Boniface VIII\") which led to the States-\nGeneral of 1302; the king of France desired that, in addition to the [Great\nOfficers of the Crown of France](/wiki/Great_Officers_of_the_Crown_of_France\n\"Great Officers of the Crown of France\"), he receive the counsel from the\nthree estates in this serious crisis. The letters summoning the assembly of\n1302 are published by M. Georges Picot in his collection of _Documents inédits\npour servir à l 'histoire de France_. During the same reign they were\nsubsequently assembled several times to give him aid by granting\n[subsidies](/wiki/Subsidies \"Subsidies\"). Over time subsidies came to be the\nmost frequent motive for their convocation.\n\nIn one sense, the composition and powers of the Estates General always\nremained the same. They always included representatives of the First Estate\n([clergy](/wiki/Clergy \"Clergy\")), Second Estate (the\n[nobility](/wiki/French_nobility \"French nobility\")), and Third Estate\n([commoners](/wiki/Commoners \"Commoners\"): all others), and monarchs always\nsummoned them either to grant subsidies or to advise [the\nCrown](/wiki/The_Crown \"The Crown\"), to give aid and counsel. Their\ncomposition, however, as well as their effective powers, varied greatly at\ndifferent times.\n\nIn their primitive form in the 14th and the first half of the 15th centuries,\nthe Estates General had only a limited elective element. The lay lords and the\necclesiastical lords ([bishops](/wiki/Bishop \"Bishop\") and other high clergy)\nwho made up the Estates General were not elected by their peers, but directly\nchosen and summoned by the king. In the order of the clergy, however, since\ncertain ecclesiastical bodies, e.g. [abbeys](/wiki/Abbey \"Abbey\") and\n[chapters](/wiki/Chapter_\\(religion\\) \"Chapter \\(religion\\)\") of\n[cathedrals](/wiki/Cathedral \"Cathedral\"), were also summoned to the assembly,\nand as these bodies, being persons in the moral but not in the physical sense,\ncould not appear in person, their representative had to be chosen by the\n[monks](/wiki/Monk \"Monk\") of the [convent](/wiki/Convent \"Convent\") or the\n[canons](/wiki/Canon_\\(priest\\) \"Canon \\(priest\\)\") of the chapter.\n\nIt was only the representation of the Third Estate which was furnished by\nelection. Originally, the latter was not called upon as a whole to seek\nrepresentation in the estates. It was only the _[bonnes\nvilles](/w/index.php?title=Bonnes_villes&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Bonnes villes\n\\(page does not exist\\)\")_ , the privileged towns, which were called upon.\nThey were represented by elected\n_[procureurs](/w/index.php?title=Procureurs&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Procureurs\n\\(page does not exist\\)\")_ , who were frequently the municipal officials of\nthe town, but deputies were often elected for the purpose. The country\ndistricts, the _[plat pays](/w/index.php?title=Plat_pays&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Plat pays \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ , were not represented. Even within the\n_bonnes villes_ , the franchise was quite narrow.\n\nIt was during the last thirty years of the 15th century that the Estates\nGeneral became an entirely elective body and really representative of the\nwhole nation as divided into three parts. This came about through various\ncauses. On the one hand, the nobles and prelates who were summoned were not\nalways inclined to attend the estates, so had themselves represented by an\nenvoy, a _procureur_ , as they had the right to do, and frequently the lords\nor prelates of the same district chose the same procureur to represent them.\nOn the other hand, the Crown seems at that time to have felt the need of\nhaving the consent of representatives really expressing the will and feelings\nof all the orders, and especially of the Third Estate as a whole. The letters\nof summons to the Estates General of 1484 invited the ecclesiastics, nobles,\nand Third Estate to meet at the chief town of their\n_[bailliage](/wiki/Bailiwick \"Bailiwick\")_ or _sénéchaussé_ and elect\ndeputies. An intermediate form had been employed in 1468 when the prelates and\nlords had still been summoned personally, but the towns had each elected three\ndeputies, an ecclesiastic, a noble and a [burgess](/wiki/Burgess_\\(title\\)\n\"Burgess \\(title\\)\").\n\nAt the estates of 1484 there seems to have been universal and direct\n[suffrage](/wiki/Suffrage \"Suffrage\") for all the three orders. But the\n_roturiers_ of the country districts could not in practice avail themselves of\nthis power; so the country communities and small towns spontaneously elected\ndelegates to represent them at the electoral assembly. Thus a system of\nindirect election arose for the Third Estate which became confirmed and\nsubsequently continued to be used. To a certain extent there were sometimes\nmore than two degrees in the suffrage; the delegates nominated by the country\ncommunities would gather together with the electors chosen by the neighbouring\nlittle town, and appoint with them new delegates to represent them at the\nelectoral assembly of the _bailliage_. This ultimately became the system. For\nthe clergy and nobles, the suffrage remained direct; but as a rule only such\necclesiastics were admitted to the assembly of the _bailliage_ as possessed a\n[benefice](/wiki/Benefice \"Benefice\"), and only such lords as had a\n[fief](/wiki/Fief \"Fief\").\n\n## Rise and fall of\npower[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Estates_General_\\(France\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Rise and fall of power\")]\n\nThe effective powers of the Estates General likewise varied over time. In the\n14th century they were considerable. The king could not, in theory, levy\ngeneral [taxation](/wiki/Taxation \"Taxation\"). Even in the provinces attached\nto [the domain of the Crown](/wiki/Crown_lands_of_France \"Crown lands of\nFrance\"), he could only levy it where he had retained the _haute justice_ over\nthe inhabitants, but not on the subjects of lords having the _haute justice_.\nThe privileged towns had generally the right of taxing themselves. To collect\ngeneral taxes, the king required consent of the lay and ecclesiastical lords,\nand of the towns. This amounted to needing authorization from the Estates\nGeneral, which only granted these subsidies temporarily for fairly short\nperiods. As a result, they were summoned frequently and their power over the\nCrown became considerable.\n\nIn the second half of the 14th century, however, certain royal taxes, levied\nthroughout the Crown's domain, tended to become permanent and independent of\nthe vote of the estates. This sprang from many causes, but from one in\nparticular; the Crown endeavoured by transforming and changing the nature of\nthe \"feudal aid\" to levy a general tax by right, on its own authority, in such\ncases as those in which a lord could demand feudal aid from his\n[vassals](/wiki/Vassal \"Vassal\"). For instance, it was in this way that the\nnecessary taxes were raised for twenty years to pay the\n[ransom](/wiki/Ransom_of_King_John_II_of_France \"Ransom of King John II of\nFrance\") of King [John II of France](/wiki/John_II_of_France \"John II of\nFrance\") without a vote of the Estates General, although they met several\ntimes during this period. Custom confined this tendency. Thus during the\nsecond half of the 15th century the chief taxes, the _[taille](/wiki/Taille\n\"Taille\")_ ,\n_[aids](/w/index.php?title=Aids_\\(French_tax\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Aids\n\\(French tax\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ and _[gabelle](/wiki/Gabelle\n\"Gabelle\")_ became definitely permanent for the benefit of the Crown,\nsometimes by the formal consent of the Estates General, as in 1437 in the case\nof the _aids_.\n\nThe critical periods of the [Hundred Years' War](/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War\n\"Hundred Years' War\") favoured the Estates General, though at the price of\ngreat sacrifices. Under the reign of King John II they had controlled, from\n1355 to 1358, not only the voting, but through their commissaries, the\nadministration of and jurisdiction over the taxes. In the first half of the\nreign of [Charles VII](/wiki/Charles_VII_of_France \"Charles VII of France\")\nthey had been summoned almost every year and had dutifully voted subsidies.\nBut when the struggle was over they renounced, through weariness and a longing\nfor peace, their most precious right, the [power of the\npurse](/wiki/Power_of_the_purse \"Power of the purse\").\n\nAt the estates of 1484, however, after the death of [Louis\nXI](/wiki/Louis_XI_of_France \"Louis XI of France\"), [the Duke of\nOrleans](/wiki/Louis_XII_of_France \"Louis XII of France\") sought to obtain the\nregency during the minority of [Charles VIII](/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France\n\"Charles VIII of France\"), but the Estates sided with Charles's sister [Anne\nde Beaujeu](/wiki/Anne_of_France \"Anne of France\") and refused.[3]\n\nDeputies of the three orders united their efforts in the hope of regaining the\nright of periodically sanctioning taxation. They voted the _taille_ for two\nyears only, at the same time reducing it to the amount it had reached at the\nend of the reign of Charles VII. They even demanded, and obtained, the promise\nof the Crown that they should be summoned again before the expiration of the\ntwo years. But the promise was not kept, and the Estates General were not\nsummoned again until 1560. There was thus a 76-year interim, during which\nsuccessive kings expanded the role of the centralised state through various\nmeans.\n\n## Revival in\n1560–1614[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Estates_General_\\(France\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Revival in 1560–1614\")]\n\nThe Estates General was revived in the second half of the 16th century because\nof scarcity of money and the quarrels and [Wars of\nReligion](/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion \"French Wars of Religion\"). The\nestates of [Orléans](/wiki/Orl%C3%A9ans \"Orléans\") in 1560, followed by those\nof [Pontoise](/wiki/Pontoise \"Pontoise\") in 1561, and those of\n[Blois](/wiki/Blois \"Blois\") in 1576 and 1588 were most remarkable for the\nwisdom, courage and efforts of the deputies, but on the whole were lacking in\neffect. Those of 1588 ended with a regular [coup d'etat](/wiki/Coup_d%27etat\n\"Coup d'etat\") effected by [Henry III](/wiki/Henry_III_of_France \"Henry III of\nFrance\"), and the States summoned by the League, which sat in\n[Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\") in 1593 and whose chief object was to elect a\n[Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church \"Roman Catholic Church\") king, were not\na success. The Estates General again met in Paris in 1614, on the occasion of\nthe disturbances that followed the death of [Henry\nIV](/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France \"Henry IV of France\"); however, though their\nminutes bear witness to their sentiments of exalted\n[patriotism](/wiki/Patriotism \"Patriotism\"), dissensions between the three\norders rendered them weak. They dissolved before completing their work and\nwere not summoned again until 1789.\n\nAs to the question whether the Estates General formed one or three\n[chambers](/wiki/Chambers_of_parliament \"Chambers of parliament\") for the\npurposes of their working, from the [constitutional](/wiki/Constitution\n\"Constitution\") point of view the point was never decided. What the king\nrequired was to have the consent, the resolution of the three estates of the\n[realm](/wiki/Realm \"Realm\"); it was in reality of little importance to him\nwhether their resolutions expressed themselves in common or separately. At the\nEstates General of 1484 the elections were made in common for the three\norders, and the deputies also arrived at their resolutions in common. But\nafter 1560 the rule was that each order deliberate separately; the royal\ndeclaration of 23 June 1789 (at the outbreak of the French Revolution) even\nstated that they formed three distinct chambers. But\n[Necker](/wiki/Jacques_Necker \"Jacques Necker\")'s report to the _conseil du\nroi_ according to which the convocation of 1789 was decided, said (as did the\ndeclaration of 23 June), that on matters of common interest the deputies of\nthe three orders could deliberate together, if each of the others decided by a\nseparate vote in favour of this, and if the king consented.\n\nThe working of the Estates General led to an almost exclusive system of\ndeliberation by [committees](/wiki/Committee \"Committee\"). There were, it is\ntrue, solemn general sessions, called _séances royales_ , because the king\npresided; but at these there was no discussion. At the first, the king or his\n[chancellor](/wiki/Chancellor \"Chancellor\") announced the object of the\nconvocation, and set forth the demands or questions put to them by the Crown;\nat the other royal sessions each order made known its answers or observations\nby the mouth of an _orateur_ elected for the purpose. But almost all useful\nwork was done in the _sections_ , among which the deputies of each order were\ndivided. At the estates of 1484 they were divided into six _nations_ or\n_sections_ , corresponding to the six\n_[généralités](/wiki/G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ralit%C3%A9 \"Généralité\")_ then existing.\nSubsequently, the deputies belonging to the same _gouvernement_ formed a group\nor _bureau_ for deliberating and voting purposes. Certain questions, however,\nwere discussed and decided in full assembly; sometimes, too, the estates\nnominated commissaries in equal numbers for each order. But in the ancient\nEstates General there was never any personal vote. The unit represented for\neach of the three orders was the _bailliage_ or _sénéchaussé_ and each\n_bailliage_ had one vote, the majority of the deputies of the _bailliage_\ndeciding in what way this vote should be given.\n\nAt the estates of the 16th century voting was by _gouvernements_ , each\n_gouvernement_ having one vote, but the majority of the _bailliages_ composing\nthe _gouvernement_ decided how it should be given.\n\nThe Estates General, when they gave counsel, had in theory only a consultative\nfaculty. They had the power of granting subsidies, which was the chief and\nordinary cause of their convocation. But it had come to be a consent with\nwhich the king could dispense, as permanent taxation became established. In\nthe 16th century, however, the estates again claimed that their consent was\nnecessary for the establishment of new taxation, and, on the whole, the facts\nseemed to be in favour of this view at the time. However, in the course of the\n17th century the principle gained recognition that the king could tax on his\nown sole authority. Thus were established in the second half of the 17th\ncentury, and in the 18th, the [direct taxes](/wiki/Direct_tax \"Direct tax\") of\nthe _[capitation](/wiki/Tax_per_head \"Tax per head\")_ and of the\n_[dixième](/w/index.php?title=Dixi%C3%A8me&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Dixième\n\\(page does not exist\\)\")_ or _[vingtième](/wiki/Vingti%C3%A8me \"Vingtième\")_\n, and many [indirect taxes](/wiki/Indirect_tax \"Indirect tax\"). It was\nsufficient for the law creating them to be registered by the _[cours des\naides](/wiki/Cours_des_aides \"Cours des aides\")_ and the\n_[parlements](/wiki/Parlement \"Parlement\")_. It was only in 1787 that the\n_parlement_ of Paris declared that it could not register the new taxes, the\nland-tax and [stamp duty](/wiki/Stamp_duty \"Stamp duty\") (_subvention\nterritoriale_ and _impôt du timbre_), as they did not know whether they would\nbe submitted to by the country, and that the consent of the representatives of\nthe tax-payers must be asked.\n\nThe Estates General had legally no share in the legislative power, which\nbelonged to the king alone. The Estates of Blois demanded in 1576 that the\nking be bound to turn into law any proposition voted in identical terms by\neach of the three orders; but Henry III would not grant this demand, which\nwould not even have left him a right of veto. In practice, however, the\nEstates General contributed largely to legislation. Those who sat in them had\nat all times the right of presenting complaints (_doléances_), requests and\npetitions to the king; in this, indeed, consisted their sole initiative. They\nwere usually answered by an _ordonnance_ , and it is chiefly through these\nthat we are acquainted with the activity of the estates of the 14th and 15th\ncenturies.\n\nIn the latest form, and from the estates of 1484 onwards, this was done by a\nnew and special procedure. The Estates had become an entirely elective\nassembly, and at the elections (at each step of the election if there were\nseveral) the electors drew up a _cahier de doléances_ (statement of\ngrievances), which they requested the deputies to present. This even appeared\nto be the most important feature of an election. The deputies of each order in\nevery _bailliage_ also brought with them a _cahier des doléances_ , arrived\nat, for the third estate, by a combination of statements drawn up by the\nprimary or secondary electors. On the assembly of the estates the _cahiers_ of\nthe _bailliages_ were incorporated into a _cahier_ for each _gouvernement_ ,\nand these again into a _cahier general_ or general statement, which was\npresented to the king, and which he answered in his council. When the three\norders deliberated in common, as in 1484, there was only one _cahier général_\n; when they deliberated separately, there were three, one for each order. The\ndrawing up of the _cahier general_ was looked upon as the main business (_le\ngrand cause_) of the session.\n\nBy this means the Estates General furnished the material for numerous\n_ordonnances_ , though the king did not always adopt the propositions\ncontained in the _cahiers_ , and often modified them in forming them into an\n_ordonnance_. These latter were the _ordonnances de reforme_ (reforming\nordinances), treating of the most varied subjects, according to the demands of\nthe _cahiers_. They were not, however, for the most part very well observed.\nThe last of the type was the _grande ordonnance_ of 1629 (_[Code\nMichau](/wiki/Code_Michau \"Code Michau\")_), drawn up in accordance with the\n_cahiers_ of 1614 and with the observations of various assemblies of notables\nthat followed them.\n\nThe peculiar power of the Estates General was recognized, but was of a kind\nthat could not often be exercised. It was, essentially, a constituent power.\nThe ancient public law of France contained a number of rules called \"the\nfundamental laws of the realm\" (_lois fondamentales du royaume_), though most\nof them were purely customary. Chief among these were rules that determined\nthe succession to the Crown and rules forbidding alienation of the domain of\nthe Crown. The king, supreme though his power might be, could not abrogate,\nmodify or infringe them. But it was admitted that he might do so by the\nconsent of the Estates General. The Estates could give the king a dispensation\nfrom a fundamental law in a given instance; they could even, in agreement with\nthe king, make new fundamental laws. The Estates of Blois of 1576 and 1588\noffer entirely convincing precedents in this respect. It was universally\nrecognized that in the event of the line of [Hugh Capet](/wiki/Hugh_Capet\n\"Hugh Capet\") becoming extinct, it would be the function of the States-General\nto elect a new king.\n\nThe Estates General of 1614 proved the last for over a century and a half. A\nnew convocation had indeed been announced to take place on the majority of\n[Louis XIII](/wiki/Louis_XIII_of_France \"Louis XIII of France\"), and letters\nwere even issued in view of the elections, but this ended in nothing. Absolute\nmonarchy progressively became definitely established, and appeared\nincompatible with the institution of the Estates General.\n[Liberal](/wiki/Liberalism \"Liberalism\") minds, however, in the entourage of\n[Louis, duc de Bourgogne](/wiki/Louis,_Dauphin_of_France_\\(1682-1712\\) \"Louis,\nDauphin of France \\(1682-1712\\)\"), who were preparing a new plan of\n[government](/wiki/Government \"Government\") in view of his expected accession\nto the French throne in succession to Louis XIV, thought of reviving the\ninstitution. It figures in the projects of [Saint-\nSimon](/wiki/Louis_de_Rouvroy,_duc_de_Saint-Simon \"Louis de Rouvroy, duc de\nSaint-Simon\") and [Fénelon](/wiki/Francois_F%C3%A9nelon \"Francois Fénelon\")\nthough the latter would have preferred to begin with an assembly of non-\nelected notables. But though St Simon stood high in the favor of the [regent\nOrléans](/wiki/Regent_Orl%C3%A9ans \"Regent Orléans\"), the death of Louis XIV\ndid not see a summoning of the Estates.\n\n##\n1789[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Estates_General_\\(France\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 1789\")]\n\nMain article: [Estates-General of 1789](/wiki/Estates-General_of_1789\n\"Estates-General of 1789\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Troisordres.jpg/220px-\nTroisordres.jpg)](/wiki/File:Troisordres.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Troisordres.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCaricature on the Third Estate carrying the first and second estate on its\nback\n\nAt the time of the revolution, the First Estate comprised 10,000 Catholic\nclergy and owned 5–10% of the lands in France—the highest per capita of any\nestate. All property of the First Estate was tax exempt. The Second Estate\ncomprised the nobility, which consisted of 400,000 people at the time,\nincluding women and children. Since the death of Louis XIV in 1715, the nobles\nhad enjoyed a resurgence in power. They had almost a monopoly over\ndistinguished government service, higher church offices, army parliaments, and\nmost other public and semipublic honors by the time of the revolution. Like\nthe First Estate, they were not taxed by the principle of feudal precedent.\nThe Third Estate comprised about 25 million people: the bourgeoisie, the\npeasants, and everyone else in France. Unlike the First and Second Estates,\nthe Third Estate were compelled to pay taxes, but the bourgeoisie found one\nway or another to be exempt from them. The heavy burden of the French\ngovernment therefore fell upon the poorest in French society—the peasantry,\nthe working poor, and the farmers. There was much resentment from the Third\nEstate towards its superiors.\n\nIn 1789, the Estates General was summoned for the first time since 1614. As\nFénelon had wished in former days, an [Assembly of\nNotables](/wiki/Assembly_of_Notables \"Assembly of Notables\") in 1787 (which\nalready displayed great independence) preceded the Estates General session.\nAccording to the model of 1614, the Estates General would consist of equal\nnumbers of representatives of each Estate, but the Third Estate demanded, and\nultimately received, double representation, which they already had in the\nprovincial assemblies. When the Estates General convened in\n[Versailles](/wiki/Versailles,_Yvelines \"Versailles, Yvelines\") on 5 May 1789,\nhowever, it became clear that the double representation was something of a\nsham: voting was to occur \"by orders\", which meant that the collective vote of\nthe 578 representatives of the Third Estate would be weighed the same as that\nof each of the other Estates.\n\nRoyal efforts to focus solely on taxes failed totally. The Estates General\nreached an immediate impasse, debating (with each of the three estates meeting\nseparately) its own structure rather than the nation's finances. On 28 May\n1789, Abbé [Sieyès](/wiki/Emmanuel_Joseph_Siey%C3%A8s \"Emmanuel Joseph\nSieyès\") moved that the Third Estate, now meeting as the _Communes_ (English:\nCommons), proceed with verification of its own powers and invite the other two\nestates to take part, but not to wait for them. They proceeded to do so,\ncompleting the process on June 17. Then they voted a measure far more radical,\ndeclaring themselves the [National\nAssembly](/wiki/National_Assembly_\\(French_Revolution\\) \"National Assembly\n\\(French Revolution\\)\"), an assembly not of the Estates but of \"the People\".\nThey invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear that they\nintended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them.\n\nKing [Louis XVI](/wiki/Louis_XVI \"Louis XVI\") of France tried to resist. When\nhe shut down the Salle des États where the Assembly met, the Assembly moved\ntheir deliberations to a nearby tennis court, where they proceeded to swear\nthe [Tennis Court Oath](/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath \"Tennis Court Oath\") (20 June\n1789), under which they agreed not to separate until they had given France a\nconstitution. A majority of the representatives of the clergy soon joined\nthem, as did forty-seven members of the nobility. By 27 June the royal party\nhad overtly given in, although the military began to arrive in large numbers\naround Paris and Versailles. Messages of support for the Assembly poured in\nfrom Paris and other French cities. On 9 July the Assembly reconstituted\nitself as the [National Constituent\nAssembly](/wiki/National_Constituent_Assembly_\\(France\\) \"National Constituent\nAssembly \\(France\\)\").\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Estates_General_\\(France\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[French States-General](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:French_States-General \"commons:Category:French States-General\")**_.  \n---|---  \n  \n  * [States General of the Netherlands](/wiki/States_General_of_the_Netherlands \"States General of the Netherlands\")\n  * [Estates General of French Canada](/wiki/Estates_General_of_French_Canada \"Estates General of French Canada\")\n  * [The Estates](/wiki/The_Estates \"The Estates\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Estates_General_\\(France\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Estates-General](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/193320/Estates-General) in _[Encyclopædia Britannica](/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica \"Encyclopædia Britannica\")_\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Kiser, Edgar; April Linton (Dec 2002). \"The hinges of history: state-making and revolt in early modern France\". _American Sociological Review_. **67** (6): 889–910.
