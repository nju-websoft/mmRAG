Massey Rhind](/wiki/J._Massey_Rhind \"J. Massey Rhind\"), appeared\nas a medallion on many of their stores\n\nMontgomery Ward was founded by [Aaron Montgomery\nWard](/wiki/Aaron_Montgomery_Ward \"Aaron Montgomery Ward\") in 1872. Ward had\nconceived of the idea of a [dry goods](/wiki/Dry_goods \"Dry goods\") [mail-\norder](/wiki/Mail-order \"Mail-order\") business in [Chicago,\nIllinois](/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois \"Chicago, Illinois\"), after several years of\nworking as a traveling salesman among rural customers. He observed that rural\ncustomers often wanted \"city\" goods, but their only access to them was through\nrural retailers who had little competition and did not offer any guarantee of\nquality. Ward also believed that by eliminating intermediaries, he could cut\ncosts and make a wide variety of goods available to rural customers, who could\npurchase goods by mail and pick them up at the nearest train station.\n\nWard started his business at his first office, either in a single room at 825\nNorth Clark Street,[1] or in a loft above a livery stable on Kinzie Street\nbetween Rush and State Streets.[2] He and two partners used $1,600 they had\nraised in capital and issued their first catalog in August 1872. It consisted\nof an 8 in × 12 in (20 cm × 30 cm) single-sheet price list, listing 163 items\nfor sale with ordering instructions for which Ward had written the copy. His\ntwo partners left the following year, but he continued the struggling business\nand was joined by his future brother-in-law, George Robinson Thorne.\n\nIn the first few years, the business was not well received by rural retailers.\nConsidering Ward a threat, they sometimes publicly burned his catalog. Despite\nthe opposition, however, the business grew at a fast pace over the next\nseveral decades, fueled by demand primarily from rural customers who were\ninspired by the wide selection of items that were unavailable to them locally.\nCustomers were also inspired by the innovative company policy of \"satisfaction\nguaranteed or your money back\", which Ward began in 1875. Ward turned the copy\nwriting over to department heads, but he continued poring over every detail in\nthe catalog for accuracy.\n\nIn 1883, the company's catalog, which became popularly known as the \"Wish\nBook\", had grown to 240 pages and 10,000 items. In 1896, Wards encountered its\nfirst serious competition in the mail order business, when [Richard Warren\nSears](/wiki/Richard_Warren_Sears \"Richard Warren Sears\") introduced his first\ngeneral catalog. In 1900, Wards had total sales of $8.7 million, compared to\n$10 million for [Sears](/wiki/Sears,_Roebuck_and_Co. \"Sears, Roebuck and\nCo.\"), and both companies would struggle for dominance during much of the 20th\ncentury. By 1904, the company had expanded such that it mailed three million\ncatalogs, weighing 4 lb (1.8 kg) each, to customers.[3]\n\nIn 1908, the company opened a 1.25-million-square-foot (116,000 m2) building\nstretching along nearly one-quarter mile of the [Chicago\nRiver](/wiki/Chicago_River \"Chicago River\"), north of downtown Chicago. The\nbuilding, known as the [Montgomery Ward & Co. Catalog\nHouse](/wiki/Montgomery_Ward_%26_Co._Catalog_House \"Montgomery Ward & Co.\nCatalog House\"), served as the company headquarters until 1974, when the\noffices moved across the street to a new tower designed by [Minoru\nYamasaki](/wiki/Minoru_Yamasaki \"Minoru Yamasaki\"). The catalog house was\ndeclared a [National Historic Landmark](/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark\n\"National Historic Landmark\") in 1978 and a Chicago historic landmark in May\n2000.[4] In the decades before 1930, Montgomery Ward built a network of large\ndistribution centers across the country in\n[Baltimore](/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland \"Baltimore, Maryland\"), [Fort\nWorth](/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas \"Fort Worth, Texas\"), [Kansas\nCity](/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri \"Kansas City, Missouri\"), [St.\nPaul](/wiki/St._Paul,_Minnesota \"St. Paul, Minnesota\"),\n[Portland](/wiki/Portland,_Oregon \"Portland, Oregon\"), and\n[Oakland](/wiki/Oakland,_California \"Oakland, California\"). In most cases,\nthese reinforced concrete structures were the largest industrial structures in\ntheir respective locations. The Baltimore [Montgomery Ward Warehouse and\nRetail Store](/wiki/Montgomery_Ward_Warehouse_and_Retail_Store \"Montgomery\nWard Warehouse and Retail Store\") was added to the [National Register of\nHistoric Places](/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places \"National Register\nof Historic Places\") in 2000.[5][6]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Montgomery_Ward_%28logo%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Montgomery_Ward_\\(logo\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Montgomery_Ward_\\(logo\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1968–1982 Montgomery Ward logo\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/Pre-Wardslogo.png/220px-\nPre-Wardslogo.png)](/wiki/File:Pre-Wardslogo.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pre-Wardslogo.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n1995–1997 Montgomery Ward logo\n\n### Expansion into retail\noutlets[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_Ward&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Expansion into retail outlets\")]\n\nWard died in 1913, after 41 years running the catalog business. The company\npresident, William C. Thorne (the eldest son of the co-founder), died in 1917,\nand was succeeded by [Robert J. Thorne](/wiki/Robert_J._Thorne \"Robert J.\nThorne\"). Robert Thorne retired in 1920 due to ill health.\n\nIn 1926, the company broke with its mail-order-only tradition when it opened\nits first retail outlet store in [Plymouth, Indiana](/wiki/Plymouth,_Indiana\n\"Plymouth, Indiana\"). It continued to operate its catalog business while\npursuing an aggressive campaign to build retail outlets in the late-1920s. In\n1928, two years after opening its first outlet, it had opened 244 stores. By\n1929, it had more than doubled its number of outlets to 531. Its flagship\nretail store in Chicago was located on [Michigan\nAvenue](/wiki/Michigan_Avenue_\\(Chicago\\) \"Michigan Avenue \\(Chicago\\)\")\nbetween Madison and Washington streets.\n\nIn 1930, the company declined a merger offer from its rival chain Sears.\nLosing money during the Great Depression, the company alarmed its major\ninvestors, including [J. P. Morgan](/wiki/J._P._Morgan,_Jr. \"J. P. Morgan,\nJr.\"). In 1931, Morgan hired [Sewell Avery](/wiki/Sewell_Avery \"Sewell Avery\")\nas president who cut staff levels and stores, changed lines, hired store\nrather than catalog managers and refurbished stores. These actions caused the\ncompany to become profitable before the end of the 1930s.\n\nWards was very successful in its retail business. \"Green awning\" stores dotted\nhundreds of small towns across the country. Larger stores were built in the\nmajor cities. By the end of the 1930s, Montgomery Ward had become the\ncountry's largest retailer and Sewell Avery became the company's chief\nexecutive officer.\n\nIn 1939, as part of a [Christmas](/wiki/Christmas \"Christmas\") promotional\ncampaign, staff copywriter [Robert L. May](/wiki/Robert_L._May_\\(Rudolph\\)\n\"Robert L. May \\(Rudolph\\)\") created the character and illustrated poem of\n\"[Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer](/wiki/Rudolph,_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer\n\"Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer\").\" The store distributed six-million copies\nof the storybook in 1946 and actor and singer [Gene Autry](/wiki/Gene_Autry\n\"Gene Autry\") popularized the song nationally.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Abandoned_Montgomery_Ward.jpg/220px-\nAbandoned_Montgomery_Ward.jpg)](/wiki/File:Abandoned_Montgomery_Ward.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Abandoned_Montgomery_Ward.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nVacant Montgomery Ward store, [Regency\nMall](/wiki/Regency_Mall_\\(Augusta,_Georgia\\) \"Regency Mall \\(Augusta,\nGeorgia\\)\"), [Augusta, GA](/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia \"Augusta, Georgia\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Vacant_Montgomery_Ward_Huntington_Beach.JPG/220px-\nVacant_Montgomery_Ward_Huntington_Beach.JPG)](/wiki/File:Vacant_Montgomery_Ward_Huntington_Beach.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Vacant_Montgomery_Ward_Huntington_Beach.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nFormer Montgomery Ward store, [Huntington Center](/wiki/Bella_Terra \"Bella\nTerra\"), [Huntington Beach, CA](/wiki/Huntington_Beach,_California \"Huntington\nBeach, California\"), demolished in 2010\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Electric_Ave_Logo_-\n_Montgomery_Wards.JPG/220px-Electric_Ave_Logo_-\n_Montgomery_Wards.JPG)](/wiki/File:Electric_Ave_Logo_-_Montgomery_Wards.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Electric_Ave_Logo_-_Montgomery_Wards.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Electric Avenue\" logo on closed store in [Panorama City](/wiki/Panorama_City\n\"Panorama City\"), California (2010)\n\nIn 1946, the [Grolier Club](/wiki/Grolier_Club \"Grolier Club\"), a society of\n[bibliophiles](/wiki/Bibliophile \"Bibliophile\") in New York City, exhibited\nthe Wards catalog alongside _[Webster's\nDictionary](/wiki/Webster%27s_Dictionary \"Webster's Dictionary\")_ as one of\n100 American books chosen for their influence on life and culture of the\npeople. The brand name of the store became embedded in the popular American\nconsciousness and was often called by the nickname **Monkey Ward** (a\n[bastardization](/wiki/Bastardization \"Bastardization\") of Mont'gy Ward), both\naffectionately and derisively.\n\n### Government\nseizure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_Ward&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Government seizure\")]\n\nIn April 1944, four months into a nationwide strike by the company’s 12,000\nworkers, U.S. Army troops seized the Chicago offices of Montgomery Ward &\nCompany. The seizure was ordered because Avery refused to settle the strike as\nrequested by the [Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D.\nRoosevelt\") administration because of its adverse effect on the delivery of\nneeded goods in wartime.[7] Avery had refused to comply with a [War Labor\nBoard](/wiki/National_War_Labor_Board_\\(1942%E2%80%931945\\) \"National War\nLabor Board \\(1942–1945\\)\") order to recognize the unions and institute the\nterms of a collective bargaining agreement. Eight months later, with\nMontgomery Ward continuing to refuse to recognize the unions, President\nRoosevelt issued an [executive order](/wiki/Executive_order \"Executive order\")\nseizing all of Montgomery Ward’s property nationwide, citing the [War Labor\nDisputes Act](/wiki/War_Labor_Disputes_Act \"War Labor Disputes Act\") as well\nas his power under the Constitution as [commander-in-chief](/wiki/Commander-\nin-chief \"Commander-in-chief\"). In 1945, [Truman](/wiki/Harry_S_Truman \"Harry\nS Truman\") ended the seizure and the [Supreme Court](/wiki/Supreme_Court\n\"Supreme Court\") ended the pending appeal as moot.[8]\n\n### Decline[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_Ward&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Decline\")]\n\nAfter World War II, Sewell Avery believed the country would fall back into a\nrecession or even a depression. He decided to not open any new stores, and did\nnot even permit expenditure for paint to freshen the existing stores. His plan\nwas to bank profits to preserve liquidity when the recession or depression\nhit, and then buy up his retail competition. However, without new stores or\nany investment back into the business, Montgomery Ward declined in sales\nvolume compared to Sears; many have blamed the conservative decisions of\nAvery, who seemed to not understand the changing economy of the postwar years.\nAs new shopping centers were built after the war, it was Sears that got the\nbest locations, and Wards was shut out of any opportunity to expand.\nNonetheless, for many years Wards was still the nation's third-largest\ndepartment store chain.\n\nIn 1955, investor [Louis Wolfson](/wiki/Louis_Wolfson \"Louis Wolfson\") waged a\nhigh-profile [proxy fight](/wiki/Proxy_fight \"Proxy fight\") to obtain control\nof the board of Montgomery Ward. The new board forced the resignation of\nAvery. This fight led to a state court decision that [Illinois](/wiki/Illinois\n\"Illinois\") corporations are not entitled to stagger election of their board\nmembers under that state's laws, as well as to tax litigation over whether the\ncosts of a proxy fight are an \"ordinary and necessary business expense.\"[9] In\ntime, it helped inspire new [Securities and Exchange\nCommission](/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission \"Securities and Exchange\nCommission\") rules concerning proxies.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout the 1950s, the company was slow to respond to the\ngeneral movement of the American middle class to [suburbia](/wiki/Suburban\n\"Suburban\"). While its competitors [Sears](/wiki/Sears \"Sears\"),\n[JCPenney](/wiki/J._C._Penney \"J. C. Penney\"), [Macy's](/wiki/Macy%27s\n\"Macy's\"), [Gimbels](/wiki/Gimbels \"Gimbels\"), and\n[Dillard's](/wiki/Dillard%27s \"Dillard's\") established new anchor outlets in\nthe growing number of suburban [shopping malls](/wiki/Shopping_mall \"Shopping\nmall\"), Avery and succeeding top executives had been reluctant to pursue such\nexpansion. They stuck to their downtown and main street stores until the\ncompany had lost too much market share to compete with its rivals. After\nAvery's departure in 1955, it took two years before the first new store since\nthe 1930s was opened in 1957. Wards tried to become more aggressive with store\nopening, but it was too late: competition had already taken the best\nlocations. As the existing stores looked worn and disheveled, malls would\noften not allow Wards to build there. Its catalog business had also begun to\nslip by the 1960s.\n\nIn 1961 then president John Barr hired [Robert Elton\nBrooker](/wiki/Robert_Elton_Brooker \"Robert Elton Brooker\") to lead Montgomery\nWard as president in its turnaround. Brooker brought with him a number of key\nnew management people, including Edward Donnell, former manager of Sears’ Los\nAngeles stores. Wards new management team achieved the turnaround reducing the\nnumber of suppliers from 15,000 to 7,000 and the number of brands being\ncarried dropped from 168 to 16. Ward’s private brands were given 95 percent of\nthe volume compared with 40 percent in 1960. The results of these changes were\nlower handling costs and higher quality standards. Buying was centralized but\nstore operations were decentralized, under a new territory system modeled\nafter Sears.[10] In 1966, Ed Donnell was named President of Montgomery Ward.\nBrooker continued as Chairmen and Chief Executive Officer until the mid 1970s.\nIn 1968 as Brooker helped engineer a friendly merger with the Container\nCorporation of America; the new company was named MARCOR. In 1974,\n[Mobil](/wiki/Mobil \"Mobil\") oil company bought MARCOR.[11]\n\nDuring the 1970s, the company continued to struggle. In 1973, its 102nd year\nin business, it purchased a small [discount store](/wiki/Discount_store\n\"Discount store\") chain, the [Miami](/wiki/Miami \"Miami\")-based Jefferson\nStores, Inc. It renamed the stores Jefferson Ward.[12] In 1976 Mobil, flush\nwith cash from the recent [rise in oil prices](/wiki/1973_oil_crisis \"1973 oil\ncrisis\"), acquired Montgomery Ward. By 1980, Mobil realized that the\nMontgomery Ward stores were doing poorly in comparison to the Jefferson\nstores, and decided that high quality discount units, along the lines of\nDayton Hudson Company's [Target](/wiki/Target_Corporation \"Target\nCorporation\") stores, would be the retailer's future. Within 18 months,\nmanagement quintupled the size of the operation, now called Jefferson Ward, to\nmore than 40 units and planned to convert one-third of Montgomery Ward's\nexisting stores to the Jefferson Ward model. The burden of servicing the new\nstores fell to the tiny Jefferson staff, who were overwhelmed by the increased\nstore count, had no experience in dealing with some of the product lines they\nnow carried, and were unfamiliar with buying for northern markets. Almost\nimmediately, Jefferson had turned from a small moneymaker into a large drain\non profits.[13] The company sold the chain's 18-store northern division to\n[Bradlees](/wiki/Bradlees \"Bradlees\"), a division of [Stop &\nShop](/wiki/Stop_%26_Shop \"Stop & Shop\"), in 1985. The remaining stores\nclosed.[14]\n\nIn 1985, the company closed its catalog business after 113 years and began an\naggressive policy of renovating its remaining stores. It restructured many of\nthe store layouts in the downtown areas of larger cities and affluent\nneighborhoods into [boutique](/wiki/Boutique \"Boutique\")-like specialty\nstores, as these were drawing business from traditional department stores. In\n1988, the company management undertook a successful $3.8 billion [leveraged\nbuyout](/wiki/Leveraged_buyout \"Leveraged buyout\"), making Montgomery Ward a\nprivately held company.\n\nIn 1987, the company began a push into [consumer\nelectronics](/wiki/Consumer_electronics \"Consumer electronics\"), using the\n\"Electric Avenue\" name. Montgomery Ward greatly expanded its electronics\npresence by shifting from a predominantly private label mix to an assortment\ndominated by major brands such as [Sony](/wiki/Sony \"Sony\"),\n[Toshiba](/wiki/Toshiba \"Toshiba\"), [Hitachi](/wiki/Hitachi,_Ltd. \"Hitachi,\nLtd.\"), [Panasonic](/wiki/Panasonic \"Panasonic\"), [JVC](/wiki/JVC \"JVC\"), and\nothers. Vice President Vic Sholis, later president of the Tandy Name Brand\nRetail Group (McDuff, VideoConcepts, and [Incredible\nUniverse](/wiki/Incredible_Universe \"Incredible Universe\")), led this\nstrategy. In 1994, revenues increased 94% largely due to Montgomery Ward's\ntremendously successful direct-marketing arms. For a short period, the company\nreentered the mail-order business, through \"Montgomery Ward Direct\", a mail\norder business licensed to the catalog giant [Fingerhut](/wiki/Fingerhut\n\"Fingerhut\"). However, by the mid-1990s, sales margins eroded in the\ncompetitive electronics and appliance hardlines, which traditionally were\nMontgomery Ward's strongest lines.\n\nIn 1989, Jim Hamilton who headed the Small Electronics department (later known\nas the Father of Computer Retailing) ran an aggressively priced PC in\nMontgomery Ward advertising. The low promotional price was $1499, unheard of\nat the time. The Computer promotion was a huge success. (Hamilton, with the\ncooperation of Packard Bell, later, for the first time ever, broke the $999 PC\nprice point floor for a \"back to school\" promotion.) After the successful\npromotion, Hamilton developed a business plan to launch the first National\nBranded Computer Product Department in the world. Executives approved the plan\nand allocated space in three Sacramento stores to create the SOHO (Small\nOffice Home Office) department. Since many of the brands, like Hewlett Packard\nand Panasonic would not disrupt their dealer channel and sell direct to\nMontgomery Ward. Hamilton had to create relationships with many distributors\nto pull together the branded department. When the Sacramento stores opened the\nshelves included brands like Hewlett Packard Printers, OkiData Printers and\nothers that had never been in a National Retailer. The test was a major\nsuccess and the SOHO department was rolled out to all Montgomery Ward\nlocations. Montgomery Ward was one of the first retailers to carry consumer\nproducts from IBM, Apple, Compaq, Hewlett Packard, Western Digital and many\nothers. The SOHO Department was carved into a separate division of the company\nand quickly became Montgomery Ward's largest revenue producing division, with\nover $4 Billion in revenues.\n\nIn 1994, Wards acquired the now-defunct [New England](/wiki/New_England \"New\nEngland\") retail chain [Lechmere](/wiki/Lechmere,_Inc. \"Lechmere, Inc.\").\n\n### Bankruptcy, restructuring, and\nliquidation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_Ward&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Bankruptcy, restructuring, and liquidation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Wards-\nlogo.gif)](/wiki/File:Wards-logo.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Wards-logo.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nIn 1997, the logo was changed to simply \"Wards\" which was used until the chain\nliquidated in 2001.\n\nBy the 1990s, however, even its rivals began to lose ground to low-price\ncompetition from [Kmart](/wiki/Kmart \"Kmart\"), [Wal-Mart](/wiki/Walmart\n\"Walmart\"), and especially [Target](/wiki/Target_Corporation \"Target\nCorporation\"), which eroded even more of Montgomery Ward's traditional\ncustomer base. In 1997, it filed for [Chapter 11\nbankruptcy](/wiki/Chapter_11_bankruptcy \"Chapter 11 bankruptcy\"), emerging\nfrom protection by the [United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern\nDistrict of\nIllinois](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Bankruptcy_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_Illinois&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") in August 1999 as a wholly owned subsidiary of [GE\nCapital](/wiki/GE_Capital \"GE Capital\"), which was by then its largest\nshareholder. As part of a last-ditch effort to remain competitive, the company\nclosed over 100 retail locations[15] in 30 [U.S. states](/wiki/U.S._state\n\"U.S. state\") (including all the Lechmere stores),[16] abandoned the specialty\nstore strategy, renamed and rebranded the chain as simply _**Wards**_\n(although unrelated, Wards was the original name for the now-defunct [Circuit\nCity](/wiki/Circuit_City \"Circuit City\")), and spent millions of dollars to\nrenovate its remaining outlets to be flashier and more consumer-friendly.\nHowever, GE Capital reneged on promises of further financial support of\nMontgomery Ward's restructuring plans.[17]\n\nOn December 28, 2000, after lower-than-expected sales during the Christmas\nseason, the company announced it would cease operating, close its remaining\n250 retail outlets, and lay off its 37,000 employees. All stores closed within\nweeks of the announcement. The subsequent liquidation was at the time the\nlargest retail [Chapter 7 bankruptcy](/wiki/Chapter_7_bankruptcy \"Chapter 7\nbankruptcy\") liquidation in American history (this would be later surpassed by\nthe 2009 liquidation of [Circuit City](/wiki/Circuit_City \"Circuit City\") and\nthe 2018 liquidation of [Toys 'R' Us](/wiki/Toys_%27R%27_Us \"Toys 'R' Us\")).\nRoger Goddu, Montgomery Ward's CEO, received an offer from JCPenney to become\nCEO, but he declined under pressure from GE Capital. One of the last stores to\nclose was the [Salem, Oregon](/wiki/Salem,_Oregon \"Salem, Oregon\"), location\nin which the human resources division was located. All of Montgomery Ward was\nliquidated by the end of May 2001, ending a 130-year enterprise.\n\n### Termination of pension\nplan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_Ward&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Termination of pension plan\")]\n\nIn 1999, Montgomery Ward completed a standard termination of its $1.1 billion\nemployee pension plan (Wards Retirement Plan WRP and Retired/Terminated\nAssociate Plan RTAP), which at that time had an alleged estimated surplus of\n$270 million. The termination of the pension plan included 30,000 Wards\nretirees and 22,000 active employees who were employed by Wards in 1999.\nAccording to tax rules at that time (to avoid paying a 50% federal excise tax\non the plan's termination), Wards then placed 25% of the plan's surplus into a\nreplacement pension plan, and paid federal tax of just 20% on the balance of\nthe surplus. The final result: the estimated remaining $25 to $50 million of\nthe employee pension plan surplus went to Wards free of income taxes, because\nthe company, which was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, had huge\noperating losses. In reality, Wards received an alleged estimated $25 to $50\nmillion for ending the employee pension plan and avoided paying hundreds of\nthousands in yearly pension premiums to the [Pension Benefit Guaranty\nCorporation](/wiki/Pension_Benefit_Guaranty_Corporation \"Pension Benefit\nGuaranty Corporation\"). Employees and retirees vested in the pension plan were\ngiven a choice of receiving an\n[annuity](/wiki/Annuity_\\(US_financial_products\\) \"Annuity \\(US financial\nproducts\\)\") from an insurance company or a lump sum payment.\n\n### Distribution\ncenters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_Ward&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Distribution centers\")]\n\nFour of the six massive catalog distribution centers Montgomery Ward built\nbetween 1921 and 1929 remain. Three have been subject to renovations for\n[adaptive reuse](/wiki/Adaptive_reuse \"Adaptive reuse\") and the buildings are\nperhaps the most tangible legacy of Montgomery Ward. Two others have been\ndemolished for various types of redevelopment.\n\n  * In [Baltimore](/wiki/Baltimore \"Baltimore\"), the 1925 warehouse, an eight-story, 1.3-million-square-foot (120,000 m2) building at 1800 Washington Blvd.[18] southwest of downtown Baltimore, now known as Montgomery Park, has been restored for office use. It has a [green building](/wiki/Green_building \"Green building\") with a green roof, storm water reutilization systems, and extensive use of recycled building materials.[19] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as the [Montgomery Ward Warehouse and Retail Store](/wiki/Montgomery_Ward_Warehouse_and_Retail_Store \"Montgomery Ward Warehouse and Retail Store\").[20]\n  * The eight-story [Fort Worth](/wiki/Fort_Worth \"Fort Worth\") facility at West 7th St and Carroll[21] was built in 1928 to replace the previous operation in a former [Chevrolet](/wiki/Chevrolet \"Chevrolet\") assembly plant across the street. In its history, the warehouse survived a flood in 1949 that reached the second floor[22] and a direct hit from [a tornado in 2000](/wiki/2000_Fort_Worth_tornado \"2000 Fort Worth tornado\").[23] After the demise of the company, developers renovated the structure as a mixed-use condominium project and retail center known as [Montgomery Plaza](/wiki/Montgomery_Plaza \"Montgomery Plaza\").[24]\n  * The [Portland, Oregon](/wiki/Portland,_Oregon \"Portland, Oregon\"), center at NW 27th and Vaughn,[25] ceased operation as a warehouse in 1976. A developer purchased the property in 1984 and renamed it [Montgomery Park](/wiki/Montgomery_Park_\\(Portland,_Oregon\\) \"Montgomery Park \\(Portland, Oregon\\)\"), converting it for offices making it the second-largest office building in Portland.[26][27]\n  * The [Kansas City](/wiki/Kansas_City \"Kansas City\") distribution center at St. John Street and North Belmont Boulevard houses the Super Flea flea market.[28]\n  * The [St. Paul, Minnesota](/wiki/St._Paul,_Minnesota \"St. Paul, Minnesota\"), center at 1450 University Ave West was the fourth of the distribution centers to be built and employed up to 2,500 employees in the 1920s. It had nearly 1.2 million square feet (110,000 m2) or approximately 27 acres under roof, making it the largest building in St. Paul at the time. The last remaining section of the original building was demolished in 1996. The site was redeveloped as a shopping center called Midway Marketplace.[29]\n  * The [Oakland, California](/wiki/Oakland,_California \"Oakland, California\"), facility, constructed in 1923, was an eight-story 950,000-square-foot (88,000 m2) structure of reinforced concrete frame that was the largest industrial building in Oakland.[30] After years of community organizing that urged city leaders to either demolish or re-purpose the site, despite opposition by preservation groups,[31] the building at 2875 International Boulevard was demolished in 2003. It has been replaced by the [Cesar Chavez](/wiki/Cesar_Chavez \"Cesar Chavez\") Education Center, an elementary school.[32]\n\n## As online\nretailer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_Ward&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: As online retailer\")]\n\nAt its height, the original Montgomery Ward was one of the largest retailers\nin the United States. After its demise, the familiarity of its brand meant its\nname, corporate logo, and advertising were still considered valuable\nintangible assets. In 2004, catalog marketer Direct Marketing Services Inc.\n(DMSI), an Iowa-based direct marketing company, purchased much of the\n[intellectual property](/wiki/Intellectual_property \"Intellectual property\")\nassets of the former Wards, including the \"Montgomery Ward\" and \"Wards\"\ntrademarks, for an undisclosed amount of money.[33]\n\nDMSI applied the brand to a new online and catalog-based retailing operation,\nwith no physical stores, headquartered in [Cedar Rapids,\nIowa](/wiki/Cedar_Rapids,_Iowa \"Cedar Rapids, Iowa\"). DMSI then began\noperating under the Montgomery Ward branding and managed to get it up and\nrunning in three months. The new firm began operations in June 2004, selling\nessentially the same categories of products as the former brand, but as a new,\nsmaller catalog.[33]\n\nThe DMSI version of Montgomery Ward was not the same company as the original.\nThe company did not honor obligations of the previous company, such as gift\ncards and items sold with a lifetime guarantee. David Milgrom, then president\nof the firm, said in an interview with the Associated Press: \"We're rebuilding\nthe brand, and we want to do it right.\"\n\nIn July 2008, DMSI announced it was on the auction block, with sale scheduled\nfor the following month. Catalog retailer [Swiss Colony](/wiki/Swiss_Colony\n\"Swiss Colony\") purchased DMSI August 5, 2008. Swiss Colony—which changed its\nname to [Colony Brands](/wiki/Colony_Brands \"Colony Brands\") Inc. on June 1,\n2010—announced it would keep the Montgomery Ward catalog division open. The\nwebsite launched September 10, 2008, with new catalogs mailing in February\n2009.[34] A month before the catalog's launch, Swiss Colony President John\nBaumann told [United Press International](/wiki/United_Press_International\n\"United Press International\") the retailer might also resurrect Montgomery\nWard's Signature and Powr-Kraft [store brands](/wiki/Store_brand \"Store\nbrand\").[35] To augment its vast selection, Montgomery Ward started promoting\nseveral exclusive new brands in July 2012 in its Early Fall 2012 catalog and\non its website, including Devonshire Collection, Apothecarie Collection and\nElysian Forest Collection furniture, Chef Tested kitchen products, Comfort\nCreek towels and sheets, Freshica shoes, Sleep Connection bedding, and Color\nConnection window treatments.[36]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_Ward&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Montgomery Ward Building (disambiguation)](/wiki/Montgomery_Ward_Building_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Montgomery Ward Building \\(disambiguation\\)\") (numerous buildings)\n  * [Montgomery Ward Company Complex](/wiki/Montgomery_Ward_Company_Complex \"Montgomery Ward Company Complex\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_Ward&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n**Notes**\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Robertson, Patrick (November 8, 2011).
