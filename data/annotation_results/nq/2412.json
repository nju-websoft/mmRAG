East\nIndies](/wiki/Spanish_East_Indies \"Spanish East Indies\"), and concluded when\nthe [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") [formally\nrecognised](/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines_\\(1946%E2%80%9365\\)#Recognition_of_independence\n\"History of the Philippines \\(1946–65\\)\") the independence of the [Republic of\nthe Philippines](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\") on July 4, 1946.\n\nWith the signing of the [Treaty of Paris](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\\(1898\\)\n\"Treaty of Paris \\(1898\\)\") on December 10, 1898, Spain [ceded](/wiki/Cession\n\"Cession\") the Philippines to the United States.[1] The interim [U.S. military\ngovernment of the Philippine\nIslands](/wiki/United_States_Military_Government_of_the_Philippine_Islands\n\"United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands\") experienced a\nperiod of great political turbulence, characterised by the\n[Philippine–American War](/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War\n\"Philippine–American War\"). Beginning in 1901, the military government was\nreplaced by a civilian government—the [Insular Government of the Philippine\nIslands](/wiki/Insular_Government \"Insular Government\")—with [William Howard\nTaft](/wiki/William_Howard_Taft \"William Howard Taft\") serving as its first\n[Governor-General](/wiki/Governor-\nGeneral_of_the_Philippines#Insular_Government_\\(1901–1935\\) \"Governor-General\nof the Philippines\"). From 1901 to 1906 there also existed a series of\n[revolutionary governments](/wiki/First_Philippine_Republic \"First Philippine\nRepublic\") that lacked significant international [diplomatic\nrecognition](/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition \"Diplomatic recognition\").\n\nFollowing the passage of the [Philippine Independence\nAct](/wiki/Tydings%E2%80%93McDuffie_Act \"Tydings–McDuffie Act\") in 1934, a\n[Philippine presidential\nelection](/wiki/Philippine_presidential_election,_1935 \"Philippine\npresidential election, 1935\") was held in 1935.

The Insular Government was\ndissolved and the [Commonwealth of the\nPhilippines](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines \"Commonwealth of the\nPhilippines\") was brought into existence. The Commonwealth of the Philippines\nwas intended to be a transitional government in preparation for the country's\nfull achievement of independence in 1946.[2]\n\nAfter the [Japanese invasion](/wiki/Philippines_Campaign_\\(1941%E2%80%9342\\)\n\"Philippines Campaign \\(1941–42\\)\") and subsequent [occupation of the\nPhilippines](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_the_Philippines \"Japanese occupation\nof the Philippines\") during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"),\nthe United States and Philippine Commonwealth military\n[recaptured](/wiki/Philippines_Campaign_\\(1944%E2%80%9345\\) \"Philippines\nCampaign \\(1944–45\\)\") the Philippines in 1945.

The outpost was strengthened by a few of our men, who silently bore their taunts and abuse the entire night. This was reported to me by General MacArthur, whom I directed to communicate with the officer in command of the insurgent troops concerned.

The result was that our picket discharged his piece, when the insurgent troops near Santa Mesa opened a spirited fire on our troops there stationed. \"The insurgents had thus succeeded in drawing the fire of a small outpost, which they had evidently labored with all their ingenuity to accomplish, in order to justify in some way their premeditated attack. It is not believed that the chief insurgent leaders wished to open hostilities at this time, as they were not completely prepared to assume the initiative.

We learn from the Insurgent records that the shot of the American sentry missed its mark. There was no reason why it should have provoked a hot return fire, but it did. The result of the ensuing combat was not at all what the Insurgents had anticipated. The Americans did not drive very well. It was but a short time before they themselves were routed and driven from their positions. Aguinaldo of course promptly advanced the claim that his troops had been wantonly attacked.
