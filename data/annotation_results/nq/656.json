(née Wallace)\nBolger.[3][4]\n\nHis entertainment aspirations evolved from the [vaudeville](/wiki/Vaudeville\n\"Vaudeville\") shows of his youth. He began his career in a vaudeville tap\nshow, creating the act \"Sanford & Bolger\" with his dance partner. In 1926, he\ndanced at New York City's legendary [Palace\nTheatre](/wiki/Palace_Theatre_\\(Broadway\\) \"Palace Theatre \\(Broadway\\)\"), the\npremier vaudeville theatre in the United States. His limber body and\nimprovisational dance movement won him many leading roles on Broadway in the\n1930s. Eventually, his career would also encompass film, television and\nnightclub work.[5] In 1932 he was elected to the theater club, [The\nLambs](/wiki/The_Lambs \"The Lambs\").[6]\n\n## Early career[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ray_Bolger&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Early career\")]\n\nBolger signed his first cinema contract with [MGM](/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\") in 1936, and although _[The Wizard of\nOz](/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_\\(1939_film\\) \"The Wizard of Oz \\(1939 film\\)\")_\nwas early in his film career, he appeared in other movies of note. His best\nknown pre-Oz appearance was _[The Great Ziegfeld](/wiki/The_Great_Ziegfeld\n\"The Great Ziegfeld\")_ (1936), in which he portrayed himself. He also appeared\nin _[Sweethearts](/wiki/Sweethearts_\\(1938_film\\) \"Sweethearts \\(1938\nfilm\\)\")_ (1938), the first MGM film in [Technicolor](/wiki/Technicolor\n\"Technicolor\"), starring [Nelson Eddy](/wiki/Nelson_Eddy \"Nelson Eddy\"),\n[Jeanette MacDonald](/wiki/Jeanette_MacDonald \"Jeanette MacDonald\"), and\n[Frank Morgan](/wiki/Frank_Morgan \"Frank Morgan\").
