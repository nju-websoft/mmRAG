He overcame the\namputation of his left arm in 1985 and continued to play with the band, which\nsubsequently went on to its most commercially successful phase. He is known as\n\"The Thunder God\" by fans.[1][2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Early life\n  * 2 Accident and recovery\n  * 3 Gear\n  * 4 Raven Drum Foundation\n  * 5 One Hand Drum Company\n  * 6 Side projects\n  * 7 Personal life\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Early\nlife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rick_Allen_\\(drummer\\)&action=edit&section=1&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Early life\")]\n\nAllen started playing drums at the age of 9. He performed in bands called\nGrad, Smokey Blue, Rampant, and the Johnny Kalendar Band.[3] When Allen was\n14, his mother replied on his behalf to an ad placed by a band called \"Def\nLeppard\" looking for a drummer to replace [Tony Kenning](/wiki/Tony_Kenning\n\"Tony Kenning\") (\"Leppard loses skins\" was the ad's headline). Later, on 1\nNovember 1978, his fifteenth birthday, Allen joined the band. In 1979, he\ndropped out of school (other band members left their jobs around the same\ntime) to concentrate on a career in music. In September 1979, they opened for\n[Sammy Hagar](/wiki/Sammy_Hagar \"Sammy Hagar\") at London's [Hammersmith\nOdeon](/wiki/Hammersmith_Odeon \"Hammersmith Odeon\"). Subsequently, Def Leppard\nplayed shows as a support act for [AC/DC](/wiki/AC/DC \"AC/DC\") during October\nand November 1979. Allen celebrated his 16th birthday with a performance at\nthe Hammersmith Odeon. On 14 March 1980, the band released their first album,\n_[On Through the Night](/wiki/On_Through_the_Night \"On Through the Night\")_.\nSince their first album, Allen still continues to record and tour with the\nband.\n\n## Accident and\nrecovery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rick_Allen_\\(drummer\\)&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Accident and recovery\")]\n\n\"What I've experienced through losing my arm, I wouldn't change. The human\nspirit is so strong.\"\n\nRick Allen[4]\n\nOn the afternoon of 31 December 1984, Allen was involved in a car accident\nwith his girlfriend Miriam Barendsen in the English countryside a few miles\nwest of [Sheffield](/wiki/Sheffield \"Sheffield\").[5] While trying to pass\nanother car at a high speed, he lost control of his [Corvette\nC4](/wiki/Corvette_C4 \"Corvette C4\"), which hit a dry stone wall and entered a\nfield. He was thrown from the car because his seatbelt had been improperly\nfastened, causing his left arm to be severed, while his girlfriend suffered\nhead injuries, resulting in grade 2 concussion and brain swelling; she also\nsuffered neck and spine injuries from severe whiplash. Doctors initially\nreattached Allen's arm, but because of an infection, it had to be re-\namputated. His right shoulder was also severely broken in the accident.[6][7]\n\nAllen initially had doubts about continuing to play with the band, but was\nencouraged by the other members to continue. Allen, along with a few\nengineers, started to design a drum set to assist his drumming.[8] At the\ntime, he was still able to play some drum rhythms with one hand and use his\nleft leg, typically for hi-hat pedals in common drum kits, to play the snare\ndrum. Then-[Status Quo](/wiki/Status_Quo_\\(band\\) \"Status Quo \\(band\\)\")\ndrummer [Jeff Rich](/wiki/Jeff_Rich \"Jeff Rich\") helped and encouraged Allen\nduring his convalescence, and designed an electronic kit Allen could play\nusing only one arm. The [Ludwig](/wiki/Ludwig-Musser \"Ludwig-Musser\") acoustic\ndrum kit he used on earlier albums _High 'n' Dry_ and _Pyromania_ was later\ngiven away by Def Leppard's one-time management. [Electronic\ndrum](/wiki/Electronic_drum \"Electronic drum\") manufacturer\n[Simmons](/wiki/Simmons_\\(electronic_drum_company\\) \"Simmons \\(electronic drum\ncompany\\)\") created a kit to their specifications, and Allen made his post-\naccident debut in 1986 at the [Monsters of Rock](/wiki/Monsters_of_Rock\n\"Monsters of Rock\") festival at [Castle Donington](/wiki/Castle_Donington\n\"Castle Donington\").\n\n##\nGear[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rick_Allen_\\(drummer\\)&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Gear\")]\n\nAllen has used custom-manufactured cable routing by\n[Whirlwind](/wiki/Whirlwind_USA \"Whirlwind USA\"). He uses four electronic\npedals for his left foot to play the pieces he used to play with his left arm,\nwhich from left to right trigger sounds of a closing hi-hat, bass drum, snare\ndrum, and a tom drum.[9] He is ranked No. 7 on the UK website\n[Gigwise](/wiki/Gigwise \"Gigwise\") in _The Greatest Drummers of All Time_\nlist.[10]\n\nOn 16 October 2009, Yamaha announced the addition of Rick Allen to their\nartist roster.[11] Allen plays Yamaha Oak Custom drums with a matching\nsubkick.[12]\n\nAlong with Yamaha Oak Custom drums, Allen also uses [Remo](/wiki/Remo \"Remo\")\ndrumheads (usually he has coated ambassadors on his drums and a clear\npowerstroke 3 on his bass drum), [Zildjian](/wiki/Zildjian \"Zildjian\") cymbals\n(mostly K customs and A customs), and a LP rock cowbell for Rock of Ages.\n\nRick Allen had used Vater drumsticks and Zildjian drumsticks from the 1980s\nuntil 1994. In 1995 up to the\npresent[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_], he uses Easton Ahead\ndrumsticks.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Raven Drum\nFoundation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rick_Allen_\\(drummer\\)&action=edit&section=4&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Raven Drum Foundation\")]\n\nAllen and his wife Lauren Monroe are the co-founders of The Raven Drum\nFoundation, a charity located in [Malibu, California](/wiki/Malibu,_California\n\"Malibu, California\"), with a mission to serve, educate, and empower veterans\nand people in crisis.[13] The Raven Drum Foundation commonly works to help\nindividuals and communities in crisis through healing arts programs, drum\ncircle events, and [collaborative\npartnerships](/wiki/Collaborative_partnerships \"Collaborative partnerships\").\nAllen described the foundations involvement with [Camp\nKilpatrick](/wiki/Camp_Kilpatrick \"Camp Kilpatrick\") in 2009:\n\n> Rhythm is such a big part of their culture and their own way of\n> communicating, so we were able to go in there and design a program around\n> them. It developed into drum council, which is an ongoing program that we\n> provided for the camp. We had tremendous success.[14]\n\n## One Hand Drum\nCompany[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rick_Allen_\\(drummer\\)&action=edit&section=5&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: One Hand Drum Company\")]\n\nThe One Hand Drum Company was created by Allen to assist in providing\nawareness and funding for his Raven Drum Foundation. Currently, the primary\nfocus of the One Hand Drum Company is promoting StikRick, a drawing by Rick of\na one-armed drummer that he sometimes uses with his autograph. The StikRick\nsite sells T-shirts, hats, and other items with the StikRick drawing along\nwith a \"Life Is Great!! Be A Rockstar!!\" slogan. Proceeds from the One Hand\nDrum Company go to support the Raven Drum Foundation charity.[15]\n\n## Side\nprojects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rick_Allen_\\(drummer\\)&action=edit&section=6&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Side projects\")]\n\nIn May and June 2000, Allen played two shows with the Mark Mason Project,\nfeaturing guitarist [Mark Englert](/wiki/Mark_Englert \"Mark Englert\")\npreviously of Dramarama. Allen has written music with his wife Lauren as well\nas played on her albums.[16] In November 2004, Allen collaborated with\n[Krishna Das](/wiki/Krishna_Das_\\(singer\\) \"Krishna Das \\(singer\\)\") in the\nrecording of a CD entitled _All One_.\n\n## Personal\nlife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rick_Allen_\\(drummer\\)&action=edit&section=7&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Personal life\")]\n\nAllen was married to his first wife Stacy from 1991 to 2000; they had a\ndaughter in 1997. In 1995, Allen was arrested for spousal abuse. He pleaded\nguilty to the charge and was sentenced on 6 August 1996 to attend [Alcoholics\nAnonymous](/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous \"Alcoholics Anonymous\") meetings, sought\ncounselling, and served 30 days on a graffiti-removal work crew.[17] They\ndivorced in 2000.\n\nAllen married again, on 10 October 2003, to Lauren Monroe. On 1 December 2010,\nMonroe gave birth to a daughter.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rick_Allen_\\(drummer\\)&action=edit&section=8&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Gold, Adam (7 August 2009).
