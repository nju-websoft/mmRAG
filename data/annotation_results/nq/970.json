K.\nRowling](/wiki/J._K._Rowling \"J. K. Rowling\"). The novels chronicle the lives\nof a young [wizard](/wiki/Magician_\\(fantasy\\) \"Magician \\(fantasy\\)\"), [Harry\nPotter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\) \"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\"), and\nhis friends [Hermione Granger](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione Granger\") and\n[Ron Weasley](/wiki/Ron_Weasley \"Ron Weasley\"), all of whom are students at\n[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\nWizardry](/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry \"Hogwarts School of\nWitchcraft and Wizardry\"). The main [story arc](/wiki/Story_arc \"Story arc\")\nconcerns Harry's struggle against [Lord Voldemort](/wiki/Lord_Voldemort \"Lord\nVoldemort\"), a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the\nwizard governing body known as the [Ministry of Magic](/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic\n\"Ministry of Magic\"), and subjugate all wizards and [Muggles](/wiki/Muggle\n\"Muggle\") (non-magical people).\n\nSince the release of the first novel, _[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher's Stone\")_, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense\npopularity, critical acclaim, and commercial success worldwide. They have\nattracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often\nconsidered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[2] The series has\nalso had its share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark\ntone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic\nviolence it depicts. As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500\nmillion copies worldwide, making them the [best-selling book series in\nhistory](/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books#List_of_best-selling_book_series\n\"List of best-selling books\"), and have been [translated into eighty\nlanguages](/wiki/Harry_Potter_in_translation \"Harry Potter in\ntranslation\").[3] The last four books consecutively set records as the\nfastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly\neleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its\nrelease.\n\nThe series was originally published in English by two major publishers,\n[Bloomsbury](/wiki/Bloomsbury_Publishing \"Bloomsbury Publishing\") in the\nUnited Kingdom and [Scholastic Press](/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation \"Scholastic\nCorporation\") in the United States. A play, _[Harry Potter and the Cursed\nChild](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Cursed_Child \"Harry Potter and the Cursed\nChild\")_ , based on a story co-written by Rowling, premiered in London on 30\nJuly 2016 at the [Palace Theatre](/wiki/Palace_Theatre,_London \"Palace\nTheatre, London\"), and its script was published by [Little,\nBrown](/wiki/Little,_Brown_Book_Group \"Little, Brown Book Group\"). The\noriginal seven books were adapted into an eight-part [film\nseries](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(film_series\\) \"Harry Potter \\(film series\\)\") by\n[Warner Bros. Pictures](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures \"Warner Bros. Pictures\"),\nwhich is the third [highest-grossing film series](/wiki/List_of_highest-\ngrossing_franchises_and_film_series \"List of highest-grossing franchises and\nfilm series\") of all time as of February 2018. In 2016, the total value of the\n_Harry Potter_ franchise was estimated at $25 billion,[4] making _Harry\nPotter_ [one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all\ntime](/wiki/List_of_the_highest-grossing_media_franchises \"List of the\nhighest-grossing media franchises\").\n\nA series of many [genres](/wiki/Genre \"Genre\"), including\n[fantasy](/wiki/Fantasy \"Fantasy\"), [drama](/wiki/Drama \"Drama\"), [coming of\nage](/wiki/Coming_of_age \"Coming of age\"), and the British [school\nstory](/wiki/School_story \"School story\") (which includes elements of\n[mystery](/wiki/Mystery_\\(fiction\\) \"Mystery \\(fiction\\)\"),\n[thriller](/wiki/Thriller_\\(genre\\) \"Thriller \\(genre\\)\"),\n[adventure](/wiki/Adventure_novel \"Adventure novel\"),\n[horror](/wiki/Horror_and_terror \"Horror and terror\"), and\n[romance](/wiki/Romance_novel \"Romance novel\")), the world of _Harry Potter_\nexplores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and\nreferences.[5] According to Rowling, the main\n[theme](/wiki/Theme_\\(literature\\) \"Theme \\(literature\\)\") is death.[6] Other\nmajor themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.[7]\n\nThe success of the books and films has allowed the _Harry Potter_ franchise to\nexpand, with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered\nin Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, [a digital\nplatform](/wiki/Pottermore \"Pottermore\") on which J.K. Rowling updates the\nseries with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films\npremiering in November 2016 with _[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find\nThem](/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_\\(film\\) \"Fantastic Beasts\nand Where to Find Them \\(film\\)\")_ , among many other developments.

His magical\nability is inborn, and children with such abilities are invited to attend\nexclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the\n[wizarding world](/wiki/Wizarding_world \"Wizarding world\").[9] Harry becomes a\nstudent at [Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry](/wiki/Hogwarts\n\"Hogwarts\"), a wizarding academy in Scotland, and it is here where most of the\nevents in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he\nlearns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social, and emotional,\nincluding ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation,\nromantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and\nthe greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in\nwizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.[10]\n\nEach novel chronicles one year in Harry's life[11] during the period from 1991\nto 1998.[12] The books also contain many\n[flashbacks](/wiki/Flashback_\\(narrative\\) \"Flashback \\(narrative\\)\"), which\nare frequently experienced by Harry viewing the memories of other characters\nin a device called a [Pensieve](/wiki/Pensieve \"Pensieve\").\n\nThe environment Rowling created is intimately connected to reality. The\nBritish magical community of the Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s\nBritish culture, European folklore, classical mythology and\n[alchemy](/wiki/Alchemy \"Alchemy\"), incorporating objects and wildlife such as\n[magic wands](/wiki/Wand \"Wand\"), magic plants, potions, spells, flying\n[broomsticks](/wiki/Broomstick \"Broomstick\"), [centaurs](/wiki/Centaur\n\"Centaur\") and other magical creatures, the [Deathly\nHallows](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Deathly_Hallows \"Magical\nobjects in Harry Potter\"), and the [Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Philosopher's Stone\"), beside others\ninvented by Rowling. While the [fantasy land](/wiki/Fantasy_world \"Fantasy\nworld\") of [Narnia](/wiki/Narnia_\\(world\\) \"Narnia \\(world\\)\") is an\n[alternate universe](/wiki/Parallel_universe_\\(fiction\\) \"Parallel universe\n\\(fiction\\)\") and the _[Lord of the Rings](/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings \"Lord of\nthe Rings\")_ ' [Middle-earth](/wiki/Middle-earth \"Middle-earth\") a mythic\npast, the wizarding world of _Harry Potter_ exists in parallel within the real\nworld and contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life,\nwith the action mostly set in Scotland (Hogwarts), the West Country, Devon,\nLondon, and Surrey in southeast England.[13] The world only accessible to\nwizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked\nhidden streets, ancient pubs, lonely country manors, and secluded castles\ninvisible to the Muggle population.[9]\n\n### Early years\n\nWhen the first novel of the series, _[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher's Stone\")_ (published in the United States as _Harry Potter and\nthe Sorcerer 's Stone_) opens, it is apparent that some significant event has\ntaken place in the wizarding world – an event so very remarkable, even Muggles\n(non-magical people) notice signs of it. The full background to this event and\nHarry Potter's past is revealed gradually throughout the series. After the\nintroductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry\nPotter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical\nbackground begins to be revealed.\n\nDespite Harry's aunt and uncle's desperate prevention of Harry learning about\nhis abilities,[14] their efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant,\n[Rubeus Hagrid](/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid \"Rubeus Hagrid\"), who is also his first\ncontact with the wizarding world. Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of\nKeys and Grounds at Hogwarts as well as some of Harry's history.[14] Harry\nlearns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed\ndark wizard [Lord Voldemort](/wiki/Lord_Voldemort \"Lord Voldemort\"), who\nsubsequently attempted to kill him as well.[14] Instead, the unexpected\nhappened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as\na memento of the attack, and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards, gravely\nweakened by his own rebounding curse. As its inadvertent saviour from\nVoldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the wizarding\nworld. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard [Albus\nDumbledore](/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore \"Albus Dumbledore\"), the orphaned Harry had\nbeen placed in the home of his unpleasant [Muggle](/wiki/Muggle \"Muggle\")\nrelatives, the Dursleys, who have kept him safe but treated him poorly,\nincluding confining him to a cupboard without meals and treating as their\nservant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of\nWitchcraft and Wizardry, a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young\nteenagers on their magical development for seven years, from age eleven to\nseventeen.\n\nWith Hagrid's help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study\nat Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is\nintroduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series. Harry\nmeets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: [Ron\nWeasley](/wiki/Ron_Weasley \"Ron Weasley\"), a fun-loving member of an ancient,\nlarge, happy, but poor wizarding family, and [Hermione\nGranger](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione Granger\"), a gifted, bright, and\nhardworking witch of non-magical parentage.[14][15] Harry also encounters the\nschool's potions master, [Severus Snape](/wiki/Severus_Snape \"Severus Snape\"),\nwho displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him, the rich brat\n[Draco Malfoy](/wiki/Draco_Malfoy \"Draco Malfoy\") whom he quickly makes\nenemies with, and the [Defence Against the Dark\nArts](/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts \"Defence Against the Dark Arts\")\nteacher, [Quirinus Quirrell](/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell \"Quirinus Quirrell\"), who\nlater turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. He also discovers a talent\nof flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house's Quidditch team, a\nsport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks. The first book\nconcludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his\nquest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the [Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Sorcerer%27s_Stone \"Sorcerer's Stone\"), a substance that bestows\neverlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold.[14]\n\nThe series continues with _[Harry Potter and the Chamber of\nSecrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets \"Harry Potter and the\nChamber of Secrets\")_ , describing Harry's second year at Hogwarts. He and his\nfriends investigate a 50-year-old mystery that appears uncannily related to\nrecent sinister events at the school. Ron's younger sister, [Ginny\nWeasley](/wiki/Ginny_Weasley \"Ginny Weasley\"), enrolls in her first year at\nHogwarts, and finds an old notebook in her belongings which turns out to be an\nalumnus's diary, Tom Marvolo Riddle, later revealed to be Voldemort's younger\nself, who is bent on ridding the school of \"mudbloods\", a derogatory term\ndescribing wizards and witches of non-magical parentage. The memory of Tom\nRiddle resides inside of the diary and when Ginny begins to confide in the\ndiary, Voldemort is able to possess her. Through the diary, Ginny acts on\nVoldemort's orders and unconsciously opens the \"Chamber of Secrets\",\nunleashing an ancient monster, later revealed to be a\n[basilisk](/wiki/Basilisk_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Basilisk \\(Harry Potter\\)\"), which\nbegins attacking students at Hogwarts. It kills those who make direct eye\ncontact with it and petrifies those who look at it indirectly. The book also\nintroduces a new [Defence Against the Dark\nArts](/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts \"Defence Against the Dark Arts\")\nteacher, [Gilderoy Lockhart](/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart \"Gilderoy Lockhart\"), a\nhighly cheerful, self-conceited wizard with a pretentious facade, later\nturning out to be a fraud. Harry discovers that prejudice exists in the\nWizarding World through delving into the school's history, and learns that\nVoldemort's reign of terror was often directed at wizards and witches who were\ndescended from Muggles. Harry also learns about the innate ability of his to\nspeak the snake language [Parseltongue](/wiki/Parseltongue \"Parseltongue\") is\nrare and often associated with the [Dark Arts](/wiki/Black_magic \"Black\nmagic\"). When Hermione is attacked and petrified, Harry and Ron finally piece\ntogether the puzzles and unlock the Chamber of Secrets, with Harry destroying\nthe diary for good and saving Ginny, and also destroying a part of Voldemort's\nsoul. The end of the book reveals Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father and rival of\nRon and Ginny's father, to be the culprit who slipped the book into Ginny's\nbelongings and introduced the diary into Hogwarts.\n\nThe third novel, _[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of\nAzkaban](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban \"Harry Potter and the\nPrisoner of Azkaban\")_ , follows Harry in his third year of magical education.\nIt is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any\nform. Instead, Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by\n[Sirius Black](/wiki/Sirius_Black \"Sirius Black\"), his father's best friend,\nand, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted\nin the murder of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the\n[dementors](/wiki/Dementors \"Dementors\") – dark creatures with the power to\ndevour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the\nschool, he reaches out to [Remus Lupin](/wiki/Remus_Lupin \"Remus Lupin\"), a\n[Defence Against the Dark Arts](/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts \"Defence\nAgainst the Dark Arts\") teacher who is eventually revealed to be a\n[werewolf](/wiki/Werewolf \"Werewolf\"). Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures\nwhich are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age.\nHarry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father\nand that Black was framed by their fourth friend, [Peter\nPettigrew](/wiki/Scabbers \"Scabbers\"), who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat,\nScabbers.[16] In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is\nemphasised – in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts\nteacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.\n\n### Voldemort returns\n\n[![\"The Elephant House\", a small, painted red café where Rowling wrote a few\nchapters of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's\nStone](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/The_Elephant_House.jpg/220px-\nThe_Elephant_House.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Elephant_House.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Elephant_House.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[The Elephant House](/wiki/The_Elephant_House_\\(Edinburgh_Caf%C3%A9\\) \"The\nElephant House \\(Edinburgh Café\\)\") was one of the cafés in\n[Edinburgh](/wiki/Edinburgh \"Edinburgh\") where Rowling wrote the first part of\n_Harry Potter_.\n\nDuring Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in _[Harry Potter and the\nGoblet of Fire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire \"Harry Potter and\nthe Goblet of Fire\")_), Harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the\nTriwizard Tournament, a dangerous yet exciting contest where three\n\"champions\", one from each participating school, must compete with each other\nin three tasks in order to win the Triwizard Cup. This year, Harry must\ncompete against a witch and a wizard \"champion\" from overseas visiting schools\nBeauxbatons and Durmstrang, as well as another Hogwarts student, causing\nHarry's friends to distance themselves from him.[17] Harry is guided through\nthe tournament by their new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, [Alastor\n\"Mad-Eye\" Moody](/wiki/Mad-Eye_Moody \"Mad-Eye Moody\"), who turns out to be an\nimpostor – one of Voldemort's supporters named [Barty Crouch,\nJr](/wiki/Barty_Crouch,_Jr \"Barty Crouch, Jr\"). in disguise. The point at\nwhich the mystery is unravelled marks the series' shift from foreboding and\nuncertainty into open conflict. Voldemort's plan to have Crouch use the\ntournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds. Although Harry manages to\nescape, [Cedric Diggory](/wiki/Cedric_Diggory \"Cedric Diggory\"), the other\nHogwarts champion in the tournament, is killed by Peter Pettigrew and\nVoldemort re-enters the Wizarding World with a physical body.\n\nIn the fifth book, _[Harry Potter and the Order of the\nPhoenix](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry Potter and the\nOrder of the Phoenix\")_ , Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort.\nIn response to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the [Order of\nthe Phoenix](/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_\\(organisation\\) \"Order of the Phoenix\n\\(organisation\\)\"), a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark\nfamily home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets,\nespecially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent\nactivities, the [Ministry of Magic](/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic \"Ministry of\nMagic\") and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort\nhas returned. In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore,\nwho along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the Wizarding World\nattempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints [Dolores\nUmbridge](/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge \"Dolores Umbridge\") as the High Inquisitor of\nHogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She transforms the\nschool into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn\nways to defend themselves against dark magic.[18]\n\nWith Ron and Hermione's suggestion, Harry forms \"[Dumbledore's\nArmy](/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army \"Dumbledore's Army\")\", a secret study group\naimed to teach his classmates the higher-level skills of Defence Against the\nDark Arts that he has learned from his previous encounters with Dark wizards.\nThrough those lessons, Harry begins to develop a crush on the popular and\nattractive [Cho Chang](/wiki/Cho_Chang \"Cho Chang\"). Juggling schoolwork,\nUmbridge's incessant and persistent efforts to land him in trouble and the\ndefensive lessons, Harry begins to lose sleep as he constantly receives\ndisturbing dreams about a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic, followed by\na burning desire. An important prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort is\nthen revealed,[19] and Harry discovers that he and Voldemort have a painful\nconnection, allowing Harry to view some of Voldemort's actions telepathically.\nIn the novel's climax, Harry is tricked into seeing Sirius tortured and races\nto the Ministry of Magic. He and his friends face off against Voldemort's\nfollowers (nicknamed [Death Eaters](/wiki/Death_Eaters \"Death Eaters\")) at the\n[Ministry of Magic](/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic \"Ministry of Magic\"). Although the\ntimely arrival of members of the Order of the Phoenix saves the teenagers'\nlives, [Sirius Black](/wiki/Sirius_Black \"Sirius Black\") is killed in the\nconflict.\n\nIn the sixth book, _[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood\nPrince](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince \"Harry Potter and the\nHalf-Blood Prince\")_ , Voldemort begins waging open warfare. Harry and his\nfriends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts. They are\nsubject to all the difficulties of adolescence – Harry eventually begins\ndating Ginny, Ron establishes a strong infatuation with fellow Hogwarts\nstudent [Lavender Brown](/wiki/Lavender_Brown \"Lavender Brown\"), and Hermione\nstarts to develop romantic feelings towards Ron. Near the beginning of the\nnovel, lacking his own book, Harry is given an old potions textbook filled\nwith many annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer\ntitled; \"the Half-Blood Prince.\" This book is a source of scholastic success\nand great recognition from their new potions master, [Horace\nSlughorn](/wiki/Horace_Slughorn \"Horace Slughorn\"), but because of the potency\nof the spells that are written in it, becomes a source of concern. With war\ndrawing near, Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore, who shows him\nvarious memories concerning the early life of Voldemort in a device called a\n[Pensieve](/wiki/Pensieve \"Pensieve\"). These reveal that in order to preserve\nhis life, Voldemort has split his soul into pieces, creating a series of\n[Horcruxes](/wiki/Horcrux \"Horcrux\") – evil enchanted items hidden in various\nlocations, one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book.[20] On\ntheir way to collect a Horcrux, Draco, who has joined with the Death Eaters,\nattempts to attack Dumbledore, and the book culminates in the killing of\nDumbledore by [Professor Snape](/wiki/Professor_Snape \"Professor Snape\"), the\ntitular Half-Blood Prince.\n\n_[Harry Potter and the Deathly\nHallows](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows\")_ , the last original novel in the series, begins directly\nafter the events of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension\nto power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione\ndrop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining\nHorcruxes. To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and\nfriends, they are forced to isolate themselves. A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill\nwith a contagious disease, Harry and the Dursleys separate, and Hermione wipes\nher parents' memories. As they search for the Horcruxes, the trio learns\ndetails about an ancient prophecy about the Deathly Hallows, three legendary\nitems that when united under one Keeper, would supposedly grant that person to\nbe the Master of Death. Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one\nof those items, and Voldemort to be searching for another: the Elder Wand, the\nmost powerful wand in history. At the end of the book, Harry and his friends\nlearn about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives – he had worked\non Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Eventually, Snape\nis killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.\n\nThe book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione, in\nconjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers\nand students, defend Hogwarts from Voldemort, his Death Eaters, and various\ndangerous [magical creatures](/wiki/Magical_creatures_\\(Harry_Potter\\)\n\"Magical creatures \\(Harry Potter\\)\"). Several major characters are killed in\nthe first wave of the battle, including [Remus Lupin](/wiki/Remus_Lupin \"Remus\nLupin\") and [Fred Weasley](/wiki/Fred_Weasley \"Fred Weasley\"), Ron's older\nbrother. After learning that he himself is a Horcrux, Harry surrenders himself\nto Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, who casts a killing curse (Avada\nKedavra) at him. The defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning of\nHarry's presumed death and continue to fight on. Harry awakens and faces\nVoldemort, whose Horcruxes have all been destroyed. In the final battle,\nVoldemort's killing curse rebounds off Harry's defensive spell (Expelliarmus),\nkilling Voldemort.\n\nAn epilogue \"Nineteen Years Later\" (set on 1 September 2017)[21] describes the\nlives of the surviving characters and the effects of Voldemort's death on the\nWizarding World. In the epilogue, Harry and Ginny are married with three\nchildren, and Ron and Hermione are married with two children.[22]\n\n## Supplementary works\n\n### _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_\n\nMain article: [Harry Potter and the Cursed\nChild](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Cursed_Child \"Harry Potter and the Cursed\nChild\")\n\n_Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_ is a two-part [West\nEnd](/wiki/West_End_theatre \"West End theatre\") stage\n[play](/wiki/Play_\\(theatre\\) \"Play \\(theatre\\)\").[23] It was written by [Jack\nThorne](/wiki/Jack_Thorne_\\(writer\\) \"Jack Thorne \\(writer\\)\"), based on a\nstory by [J. K. Rowling](/wiki/J._K._Rowling \"J. K. Rowling\"), Thorne and\ndirector [John Tiffany](/wiki/John_Tiffany \"John Tiffany\"). The play opened on\n30 July 2016 at the [Palace Theatre](/wiki/Palace_Theatre,_London \"Palace\nTheatre, London\"), [London](/wiki/London \"London\"), [England](/wiki/England\n\"England\"). The script was released on 31 July 2016.[24] The story is set\nnineteen years after the ending of _[Harry Potter and the Deathly\nHallows](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows\")_ and follows [Harry Potter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\)\n\"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\"), now a [Ministry of\nMagic](/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic \"Ministry of Magic\") employee, and his youngest\nson [Albus Severus Potter](/wiki/Albus_Severus_Potter \"Albus Severus Potter\").\nThe play's official synopsis was released on 23 October 2015:[25]\n\n> It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that\n> he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father\n> of three school-age children.\n>\n> While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his\n> youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never\n> wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the\n> uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.\n\n### In-universe books\n\nSee also: [J. K. Rowling § Philanthropy](/wiki/J._K._Rowling#Philanthropy \"J.\nK. Rowling\")\n\nRowling has expanded the [Harry Potter universe](/wiki/Harry_Potter_universe\n\"Harry Potter universe\") with several short books produced for various\ncharities.[26][27] In 2001, she released _[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find\nThem](/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them \"Fantastic Beasts and\nWhere to Find Them\")_ (a purported Hogwarts textbook) and _[Quidditch Through\nthe Ages](/wiki/Quidditch_Through_the_Ages \"Quidditch Through the Ages\")_ (a\nbook Harry reads for fun). Proceeds from the sale of these two books benefited\nthe charity [Comic Relief](/wiki/Comic_Relief \"Comic Relief\").[28] In 2007,\nRowling composed seven handwritten copies of _[The Tales of Beedle the\nBard](/wiki/The_Tales_of_Beedle_the_Bard \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\")_ , a\ncollection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel, one of which\nwas auctioned to raise money for the Children's High Level Group, a fund for\nmentally disabled children in poor countries. The book was published\ninternationally on 4 December 2008.[29][30] Rowling also wrote an 800-word\n[prequel](/wiki/Harry_Potter_prequel \"Harry Potter prequel\") in 2008 as part\nof a fundraiser organised by the bookseller [Waterstones](/wiki/Waterstones\n\"Waterstones\").[31] All three of these books contain extra information about\nthe wizarding world not included in the original novels.\n\nIn 2016, she released three new e-books: _[Hogwarts: An Incomplete and\nUnreliable Guide](/wiki/Hogwarts:_An_Incomplete_and_Unreliable_Guide\n\"Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide\")_ , _[Short Stories from\nHogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky\nPoltergeists](/wiki/Short_Stories_from_Hogwarts_of_Power,_Politics_and_Pesky_Poltergeists\n\"Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists\")_ and\n_[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous\nHobbies](/wiki/Short_Stories_from_Hogwarts_of_Heroism,_Hardship_and_Dangerous_Hobbies\n\"Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous\nHobbies\")_.[32]\n\n### Pottermore website\n\nIn 2011, Rowling launched a new website announcing an upcoming project called\n[Pottermore](/wiki/Pottermore \"Pottermore\").[33] Pottermore opened to the\ngeneral public on 14 April 2012.[34] Pottermore allows users to be sorted, be\nchosen by their wand and play various minigames. The main purpose of the\nwebsite was to allow the user to journey though the story with access to\ncontent not revealed by JK Rowling previously, with over 18,000 words of\nadditional content.[35]\n\nIn September 2015, the website was completely overhauled and most of the\nfeatures were removed. The site has been redesigned and it mainly focuses on\nthe information already available, rather than exploration.[36]\n\n## Structure and genre\n\nThe _Harry Potter_ novels are mainly directed at a young adult audience as\nopposed to an audience of middle grade readers, children, or adults. The\nnovels fall within the genre of [fantasy literature](/wiki/Fantasy_literature\n\"Fantasy literature\"), and qualify as a type of fantasy called \"[urban\nfantasy](/wiki/Urban_fantasy \"Urban fantasy\")\", \"contemporary fantasy\", or\n\"low fantasy\". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly serious and dark\ntone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances of\n[tragicomedy](/wiki/Tragicomedy \"Tragicomedy\") and black humour. In many\nrespects, they are also examples of the _[bildungsroman](/wiki/Bildungsroman\n\"Bildungsroman\")_ , or [coming of age](/wiki/Coming_of_age \"Coming of age\")\nnovel,[37] and contain elements of [mystery](/wiki/Mystery_\\(fiction\\)\n\"Mystery \\(fiction\\)\"), adventure, [horror](/wiki/Horror_fiction \"Horror\nfiction\"), [thriller](/wiki/Thriller_\\(genre\\) \"Thriller \\(genre\\)\"), and\n[romance](/wiki/Romance_novel \"Romance novel\"). The books are also, in the\nwords of [Stephen King](/wiki/Stephen_King \"Stephen King\"), \"shrewd mystery\ntales\",[38] and each book is constructed in the manner of a [Sherlock\nHolmes](/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes \"Sherlock Holmes\")-style\n[mystery](/wiki/Mystery_fiction \"Mystery fiction\") adventure. The stories are\ntold from a [third person limited](/wiki/Third_person_limited \"Third person\nlimited\") point of view with very few exceptions (such as the opening chapters\nof _[Philosopher's Stone](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone\n\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\")_, _[Goblet of\nFire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire \"Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire\")_ and _[Deathly Hallows](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\")_ and the first two chapters of _[Half-\nBlood Prince](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince \"Harry Potter and\nthe Half-Blood Prince\")_).\n\nThe series can be considered part of the British children's [boarding school\ngenre](/wiki/School_story \"School story\"), which includes [Rudyard\nKipling](/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling \"Rudyard Kipling\")'s [Stalky &\nCo.](/wiki/Stalky_%26_Co. \"Stalky & Co.\"), [Enid Blyton](/wiki/Enid_Blyton\n\"Enid Blyton\")'s _[Malory Towers](/wiki/Malory_Towers \"Malory Towers\")_ ,\n_[St. Clare's](/wiki/St._Clare%27s_series \"St. Clare's series\")_ and the\n_[Naughtiest Girl](/wiki/Naughtiest_Girl \"Naughtiest Girl\")_ series, and\n[Frank Richards's](/wiki/Charles_Hamilton_\\(writer\\) \"Charles Hamilton\n\\(writer\\)\") _[Billy Bunter](/wiki/Billy_Bunter \"Billy Bunter\")_ novels: the\n_Harry Potter_ books are predominantly set in [Hogwarts](/wiki/Hogwarts\n\"Hogwarts\"), a fictional British boarding school for wizards, where the\ncurriculum includes the use of [magic](/wiki/Magic_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Magic\n\\(Harry Potter\\)\").[39] In this sense they are \"in a direct line of descent\nfrom [Thomas Hughes](/wiki/Thomas_Hughes \"Thomas Hughes\")'s _[Tom Brown's\nSchool Days](/wiki/Tom_Brown%27s_School_Days \"Tom Brown's School Days\")_ and\nother Victorian and Edwardian novels of [British public\nschool](/wiki/Public_school_\\(UK\\) \"Public school \\(UK\\)\") life\", though they\nare, as many note, more contemporary, grittier, darker, and more mature than\nthe typical boarding school novel, addressing serious themes of death, love,\nloss, prejudice, coming-of-age, and the loss of innocence in a 1990s British\nsetting.[40][41]\n\nThe _Harry Potter_ stories feature much medieval imagery and motifs drawn from\nthe King Arthur stories. Hogwarts resembles a medieval university-cum-castle\nwith several professors who belonging to an Order of Merlin; Old Professor\nBinns still lectures about the International Warlock Convention of 1289; and a\nreal historical person, a 14th century scribe Sir [Nicolas\nFlamel](/wiki/Nicolas_Flamel \"Nicolas Flamel\"), is described as a holder of\nthe Philosopher's Stone.[42] Other medieval elements in Hogwarts include\ncoats-of-arms and medieval weapons on the walls, letters written on parchment\nand sealed with wax, the Great Hall of Hogwarts which is similar to the Great\nHall of Camelot, the use of Latin phrases, the tents put up for Quidditch\ntournaments are similar to the \"marvelous tents\" put up for knightly\ntournaments, imaginary animals like dragons and unicorns which exist around\nHogwarts, and the banners with heraldic animals for the four Houses of\nHogwarts.[42] Many of the motifs of the Potter stories such as the hero's\nquest invoking objects that confer invisibility, magical animals and trees, a\nforest full of danger and the recognition of a character based upon scars are\ndrawn from medieval French Arthurian romances.[42] Other aspects borrowed from\nFrench Arthurian romances include the use of owls as messengers, werewolves as\ncharacters, and white deer.[43] The American scholars Heather Arden and Kathrn\nLorenz in particular argue that many aspects of the Potter stories are\ninspired by a 14th century French Arthurian romance, _Claris et Laris_ ,\nwriting of the \"startling\" similarities between the adventures of Potter and\nthe knight Claris.[42] Arden and Lorenz noted that Rowling graduated from the\nUniversity of Exeter in 1986 with a degree in French literature and spent a\nyear living in France afterwards.[43]\n\nArnden and Lorenz wrote about the similarity between the Arthurian romances,\nwhere Camelot is a place of wonder and safety, and from the heroic knights\nmust venture forth facing various perils, usually in an enchanted forest; and\nHogwarts, likewise a wondrous safe place, where Harry Potter and friends must\nperiodically venture forth from to the magical forest that surrounds\nHogwarts.[43] In the same way that knights in the Arthurian romances usually\nhave a female helper, who is very intelligent and has a connection with\nnature, Harry has Hermione who plays a similar role.[43] Like an Arthurian\nknight, Harry receives advice and encouragement from his mentor, Albus\nDumbldore, who resembles both Merlin and King Arthur, but must vanquish his\nfoes alone.[43] Arnden and Lorenz wrote that with Rowling's books, the\ncharacters are \"...not a simple reworking of the well-known heroes of romance,\nbut a protean melding of different characters to form new ones...\".[43]\nHowever, Lorenz and Arnden argue the main inspiration for Harry Potter was\n[Sir Percival](/wiki/Percival \"Percival\"), one of the Knights of the Round\nTable who searches for the Holy Grail.[43] Both Potter and Sir Percival had an\n\"orphaned or semi-orphaned youth, with inherent nobility and powers\", being\nraised by relatives who tried to keep them away from the places where they\nreally belong, Hogwarts and Camelot respectively.[43] Both Percival and Potter\nare however outsiders in the places that they belong, unfamiliar with the\nrules of knighthood and magic, but both show extraordinary natural abilities\nwith Percival proving himself an exceptional fighter while Potter is an\nexcellent player of Quidditch.[43] And finally, both Percival and Potter found\nlove and acceptance from surrogate families, in the form of the Knights of the\nRound Table and the Weasley family respectively.[43]\n\nEach of the seven books is set over the course of one school year. Harry\nstruggles with the problems he encounters, and dealing with them often\ninvolves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught\nbreaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories\nreach their climax in the [summer term](/wiki/Summer_term \"Summer term\"), near\nor just after [final exams](/wiki/Final_examination \"Final examination\"), when\nevents escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must\nconfront either [Voldemort](/wiki/Voldemort \"Voldemort\") or one of his\nfollowers, the [Death Eaters](/wiki/Death_Eaters \"Death Eaters\"), with the\nstakes a matter of life and death – a point underlined, as the series\nprogresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four\nbooks.[44][45] In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through\nexposition and discussions with head teacher and [mentor](/wiki/Mentor\n\"Mentor\") [Albus Dumbledore](/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore \"Albus Dumbledore\"). The\nonly exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, _[Harry\nPotter and the Deathly Hallows](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\")_ , in which Harry and his friends\nspend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face\nVoldemort at the _[dénouement](/wiki/D%C3%A9nouement \"Dénouement\")_.[44]\n\n## Themes\n\nAccording to Rowling, a major theme in the series is death: \"My books are\nlargely about death. They open with the death of Harry's parents. There is\nVoldemort's obsession with conquering death and his quest for\n[immortality](/wiki/Immortality \"Immortality\") at any price, the goal of\nanyone with magic. I so understand why Voldemort wants to conquer death. We're\nall frightened of it.\"[6]\n\nRowling stated that \"_Harry Potter_ books have always, in fact, dealt\nexplicitly with religious themes and questions\" and that she did not reveal\nits Christian parallels in the beginning because doing so would have \"give[n]\ntoo much away to fans who might then see the parallels.\"[46] In the final book\nof the series _[Harry Potter and the Deathly\nHallows](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows\")_ , Rowling makes the book's Christian imagery more explict,\nquoting both [Matthew\n6:19](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/Matthew#6:19\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/Matthew\") and [1 Corinthians\n15:26](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(King_James\\)/1_Corinthians#15:26\n\"s:Bible \\(King James\\)/1 Corinthians\") when Harry visits his parents'\n[graves](/wiki/Kirkyard \"Kirkyard\").[46] [Hermione\nGranger](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione Granger\") teaches Harry Potter that\nthe meaning of these verses from the [Christian Bible](/wiki/Christian_Bible\n\"Christian Bible\") are \"living beyond death. Living after death\", which\nRowling states is \"one of the central foundations of [resurrection\ntheology](/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead#Views_in_Christianity \"Resurrection\nof the dead\")\" and that these bible verses \"epitomize the whole\nseries\".[46][47][48]\n\nAcademics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes\nin the books, some more complex than others, and some including [political\nsubtexts](/wiki/Politics_of_Harry_Potter \"Politics of Harry Potter\"). Themes\nsuch as [normality](/wiki/Normality_\\(behavior\\) \"Normality \\(behavior\\)\"),\noppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as\nprevalent throughout the series.[49] Similarly, the theme of making one's way\nthrough adolescence and \"going over one's most harrowing ordeals – and thus\ncoming to terms with them\" has also been considered.[50] Rowling has stated\nthat the books comprise \"a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea\nfor an end to [bigotry](/wiki/Bigotry \"Bigotry\")\" and that they also pass on a\nmessage to \"question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the\npress tells you all of the truth\".[51]\n\nWhile the books could be said to comprise many other themes, such as\npower/abuse of power, violence and hatred, love, loss, prejudice, and free\nchoice, they are, as Rowling states, \"deeply entrenched in the whole plot\";\nthe writer prefers to let themes \"grow organically\", rather than sitting down\nand consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers.[7] Along the\nsame lines is the ever-present theme of adolescence, in whose depiction\nRowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters' sexualities and\nnot leaving Harry, as she put it, \"stuck in a state of permanent pre-\npubescence\". Rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction of the\nways in which death and violence affects youth, and humanity as a whole.[52]\n\nRowling said that, to her, the moral significance of the tales seems\n\"blindingly obvious\". The key for her was the choice between what is right and\nwhat is easy, \"because that … is how tyranny is started, with people being\n[apathetic](/wiki/Apathetic \"Apathetic\") and taking the easy route and\nsuddenly finding themselves in deep trouble.\"[53]\n\n## Origins\n\nMain article: [Harry Potter influences and\nanalogues](/wiki/Harry_Potter_influences_and_analogues \"Harry Potter\ninfluences and analogues\")\n\nIn 1990, Rowling was on a crowded train from [Manchester](/wiki/Manchester\n\"Manchester\") to London when the idea for Harry suddenly \"fell into her head\".\nRowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying:[54]\n\n> \"I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never\n> been so excited about an idea before. I simply sat and thought, for four\n> (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this\n> scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard\n> became more and more real to me.\"\n\nRowling completed _Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone_ in 1995 and the\n[manuscript](/wiki/Manuscript \"Manuscript\") was sent off to several\nprospective [agents](/wiki/Literary_agent \"Literary agent\").[55] The second\nagent she tried, Christopher Little, offered to represent her and sent the\nmanuscript to Bloomsbury.\n\n## Publishing history\n\n[![J.K.

She elected to use J. K.

This led to more and\nmore copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-\nEnglish speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the\nfifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language\nbook ever to top the best-seller list in France.[77]\n\nThe United States editions were adapted into [American\nEnglish](/wiki/American_English \"American English\") to make them more\nunderstandable to a young American audience.[78]\n\n### Completion of the series\n\nIn December 2005, Rowling stated on her web site, \"2006 will be the year when\nI write the final book in the _Harry Potter_ series.\"[79] Updates then\nfollowed in her [online diary](/wiki/Online_diary \"Online diary\") chronicling\nthe progress of _[Harry Potter and the Deathly\nHallows](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows\")_ , with the release date of 21 July 2007.

Rowling finished\nwriting _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ in this room (552) on 11\nJanuary 2007.\"[80]\n\nRowling herself has stated that the last chapter of the final book (in fact,\nthe epilogue) was completed \"in something like 1990\".[81][82] In June 2006,\nRowling, on an appearance on the British talk show _[Richard&\nJudy](/wiki/Richard_%26_Judy \"Richard & Judy\")_, announced that the chapter\nhad been modified as one character \"got a reprieve\" and two others who\npreviously survived the story had in fact been killed. On 28 March 2007, the\ncover art for the Bloomsbury Adult and Child versions and the Scholastic\nversion were released.[83][84]\n\nIn September 2012, Rowling mentioned in an interview that she might go back to\nmake a \"[director's cut](/wiki/Director%27s_cut \"Director's cut\")\" of two of\nthe existing _Harry Potter_ books.[85]\n\n### Cover art\n\nFor cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design, with\nthe first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator [Thomas\nTaylor](/wiki/Thomas_Taylor_\\(artist\\) \"Thomas Taylor \\(artist\\)\") showing\nHarry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font [Cochin\nBold](/wiki/Cochin_\\(typeface\\) \"Cochin \\(typeface\\)\").[86] The first releases\nof the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat\nmore realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created\nby first [Cliff Wright](/wiki/Cliff_Wright \"Cliff Wright\") and then Jason\nCockroft.[87]\n\nDue to the appeal of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury\ncommissioned a second line of editions in an 'adult' style. These initially\nused black-and-white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the\nbooks (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting people,\nbut later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin's\nlocket on the cover of the final book.\n\nInternational and later editions have been created by a range of designers,\nincluding [Mary GrandPré](/wiki/Mary_GrandPr%C3%A9 \"Mary GrandPré\") for U.S.\naudiences and [Mika Launis](/wiki/Mika_Launis \"Mika Launis\") in\nFinland.[88][89] For a later American release, [Kazu\nKibuishi](/wiki/Kazu_Kibuishi \"Kazu Kibuishi\") created covers in a somewhat\nanime-influenced style.[90][91]\n\n## Achievements\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Harry_Potter_Platform_Kings_Cross.jpg/220px-\nHarry_Potter_Platform_Kings_Cross.jpg)](/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_Platform_Kings_Cross.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_Platform_Kings_Cross.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Platform 9¾\" sign on [London King's Cross railway\nstation](/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station \"London King's Cross\nrailway station\")\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nFurther information: [Harry Potter fandom](/wiki/Harry_Potter_fandom \"Harry\nPotter fandom\")\n\nFans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores\naround the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of\nthe books, beginning with the 2000 publication of _Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire_. The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting,\nand other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and\nhave been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly\nnine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of _Harry Potter and the\nHalf-Blood Prince_ sold in the first 24 hours.[92][93]\n\nThe final book in the series, _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ became\nthe fastest selling book in history, moving 11 million units in the first\ntwenty-four hours of release.[94] The series has also gathered adult fans,\nleading to the release of two editions of each _Harry Potter_ book, identical\nin text but with one edition's cover artwork aimed at children and the other\naimed at adults.[95] Besides meeting online through blogs,\n[podcasts](/wiki/Podcast \"Podcast\"), and fansites, _Harry Potter_ super-fans\ncan also meet at _Harry Potter_ [symposia](/wiki/Academic_conference \"Academic\nconference\").\n\nThe word _Muggle_ has spread beyond its _Harry Potter_ origins, becoming one\nof few pop culture words to land in the [Oxford English\nDictionary](/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary \"Oxford English Dictionary\").[96]\nThe Harry Potter fandom has embraced podcasts as a regular, often weekly,\ninsight to the latest discussion in the fandom. Both\n[MuggleCast](/wiki/MuggleCast \"MuggleCast\") and [PotterCast](/wiki/PotterCast\n\"PotterCast\")[97] have reached the top spot of iTunes podcast rankings and\nhave been polled one of the top 50 favourite podcasts.[98]\n\nSome lessons identified in the series include diversity, acceptance, political\ntolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United\nStates show that those who read the books were significantly different than\nthose who had not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more\nopposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical.\nAlthough it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is\na clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be\nstronger than just a fandom bond.[99]\n\nMany [fan fiction](/wiki/Fan_fiction \"Fan fiction\") and [fan\nart](/wiki/Fan_art \"Fan art\") works about _Harry Potter_ have been made. In\nMarch 2007, \"Harry Potter\" was the most commonly searched fan fiction subject\non the internet.[100] At the [University of\nMichigan](/wiki/University_of_Michigan \"University of Michigan\") in 2009,\n[StarKid Productions](/wiki/StarKid_Productions \"StarKid Productions\")\nperformed an original musical parodying the _Harry Potter_ series called _[A\nVery Potter Musical](/wiki/A_Very_Potter_Musical \"A Very Potter Musical\")_.\nThe musical was awarded _[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly\n\"Entertainment Weekly\")_ 's 10 Best Viral Videos of 2009.[101]\n\nThe sport [Quidditch](/wiki/Quidditch_\\(sport\\) \"Quidditch \\(sport\\)\"), played\nby characters in the _Harry Potter_ series, was created in 2005 and is played\nworldwide.[102] Characters and elements from the series have inspired\n[scientific names](/wiki/Scientific_name \"Scientific name\") of several\norganisms, including the dinosaur _[Dracorex\nhogwartsia](/wiki/Dracorex_hogwartsia \"Dracorex hogwartsia\")_ , the spider\n_[Eriovixia gryffindori](/wiki/Eriovixia_gryffindori \"Eriovixia gryffindori\")_\n, the wasp _[Ampulex dementor](/wiki/Ampulex_dementor \"Ampulex dementor\")_ ,\nand the crab _[Harryplax severus](/wiki/Harryplax_severus \"Harryplax\nseverus\")_.[103]\n\n### Commercial success\n\nSee also: [List of best-selling books](/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books \"List\nof best-selling books\")\n\n[![A large crowd of fans wait outside of a Borders store in Delaware, waiting\nfor the release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood\nPrince](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Harry_Potter_lines.jpg/220px-\nHarry_Potter_lines.jpg)](/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_lines.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_lines.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCrowd outside a book store for the midnight release of _[Harry Potter and the\nHalf-Blood Prince](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince \"Harry Potter\nand the Half-Blood Prince\")_.\n\nThe popularity of the _Harry Potter_ series has translated into substantial\nfinancial success for Rowling, her publishers, and other _Harry Potter_\nrelated license holders. This success has made Rowling the first and thus far\nonly billionaire author.[104] The books have sold more than 500 million copies\nworldwide and have also given rise to the popular [film\nadaptations](/wiki/Film_adaptation \"Film adaptation\") produced by [Warner\nBros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\"), [all of which have been highly\nsuccessful in their own right](/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films \"List of\nhighest-grossing films\").[105][106] The films have in turn spawned eight video\ngames and have led to the licensing of more than 400 additional _Harry Potter_\nproducts. The _Harry Potter_ brand has been estimated to be worth as much as\n$25 billion.[4]\n\nThe great demand for Harry Potter books motivated _The New York Times_ to\ncreate a separate best-seller list for children's literature in 2000, just\nbefore the release of _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_. By 24 June 2000,\nRowling's novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks; the first three\nnovels were each on the hardcover best-seller list.[107] On 12 April 2007,\n[Barnes & Noble](/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble \"Barnes & Noble\") declared that\n_Deathly Hallows_ had broken its [pre-order](/wiki/Pre-order \"Pre-order\")\nrecord, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site.[108] For\nthe release of _Goblet of Fire_ , 9,000 [FedEx](/wiki/FedEx \"FedEx\") trucks\nwere used with no other purpose than to deliver the book.[109] Together,\nAmazon.com and [Barnes & Noble](/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble \"Barnes & Noble\") pre-\nsold more than 700,000 copies of the book.[109] In the United States, the\nbook's initial printing run was 3.8 million copies.[109] This record statistic\nwas broken by _[Harry Potter and the Order of the\nPhoenix](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix \"Harry Potter and the\nOrder of the Phoenix\")_ , with 8.5 million, which was then shattered by _Half-\nBlood Prince_ with 10.8 million copies.[110] 6.9 million copies of _Prince_\nwere sold in the U.S. within the first 24 hours of its release; in the United\nKingdom more than two million copies were sold on the first day.[111] The\ninitial U.S. print run for _Deathly Hallows_ was 12 million copies, and more\nthan a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble.[112]\n\n### Awards, honours, and recognition\n\nThe _Harry Potter_ series has been recognised by a host of awards since the\ninitial publication of _Philosopher 's Stone_ including four Whitaker Platinum\nBook Awards (all of which were awarded in 2001),[113] three [Nestlé Smarties\nBook Prizes](/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_Smarties_Book_Prize \"Nestlé Smarties Book\nPrize\") (1997–1999),[114] two [Scottish Arts\nCouncil](/wiki/Scottish_Arts_Council \"Scottish Arts Council\") Book Awards\n(1999 and 2001),[115] the inaugural [Whitbread children's book of the year\naward](/wiki/Costa_Book_Awards \"Costa Book Awards\") (1999),[116] the [WHSmith\nbook of the year](/wiki/British_Book_Awards \"British Book Awards\")\n(2006),[117] among others. In 2000, _[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of\nAzkaban](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban \"Harry Potter and the\nPrisoner of Azkaban\")_ was nominated for a [Hugo Award for Best\nNovel](/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel \"Hugo Award for Best Novel\"), and in\n2001, _[Harry Potter and the Goblet of\nFire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire \"Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire\")_ won said award.[118] Honours include a commendation for the\n[Carnegie Medal](/wiki/Carnegie_Medal_\\(literary_award\\) \"Carnegie Medal\n\\(literary award\\)\") (1997),[119] a short listing for the [Guardian Children's\nAward](/wiki/Guardian_Award \"Guardian Award\") (1998), and numerous listings on\nthe notable books, editors' Choices, and best books lists of the [American\nLibrary Association](/wiki/American_Library_Association \"American Library\nAssociation\"), _The New York Times_ , [Chicago Public\nLibrary](/wiki/Chicago_Public_Library \"Chicago Public Library\"), and\n_[Publishers Weekly](/wiki/Publishers_Weekly \"Publishers Weekly\")_.[120]\n\nIn 2002, British sociologist Andrew Blake named _Harry Potter_ among the icons\nof [British popular culture](/wiki/British_popular_culture \"British popular\nculture\") along with the likes of [James Bond](/wiki/James_Bond \"James Bond\")\nand [Sherlock Holmes](/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes \"Sherlock Holmes\").[121] In 2003,\nfour of the books were named in the top 24 of the BBC's [The Big\nRead](/wiki/The_Big_Read \"The Big Read\") survey of the best loved novels in\nthe UK.[122] A 2004 study found that books in the series were commonly read\naloud in elementary schools in [San Diego County,\nCalifornia](/wiki/San_Diego_County,_California \"San Diego County,\nCalifornia\").[123] Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. [National Education\nAssociation](/wiki/National_Education_Association \"National Education\nAssociation\") listed the series in its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for\nChildren\".[124] Three of the books placed among the \"Top 100 Chapter Books\" of\nall time, or children's novels, in a 2012 survey published by _[School Library\nJournal](/wiki/School_Library_Journal \"School Library Journal\")_ : _Sorcerer\n's Stone_ ranked number three, _Prisoner of Azkaban_ 12th, and _Goblet of\nFire_ 98th.[125] In 2012, the [opening\nceremony](/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics_opening_ceremony \"2012 Summer Olympics\nopening ceremony\") of the [2012 Summer Olympics](/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics\n\"2012 Summer Olympics\") in [London](/wiki/London \"London\") featured a 100-foot\ntall rendition of Lord Voldemort in a segment designed to show off the UK's\ncultural icons.[126]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Literary criticism\n\nEarly in its history, _Harry Potter_ received positive reviews. On\npublication, the first book, _Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone_,\nattracted attention from the Scottish newspapers, such as _[The\nScotsman](/wiki/The_Scotsman \"The Scotsman\")_ , which said it had \"all the\nmakings of a classic\",[127] and _[The Glasgow\nHerald](/wiki/The_Herald_\\(Glasgow\\) \"The Herald \\(Glasgow\\)\")_ , which called\nit \"Magic stuff\".[127] Soon the English newspapers joined in, with more than\none comparing it to [Roald Dahl](/wiki/Roald_Dahl \"Roald Dahl\")'s work: _[The\nMail on Sunday](/wiki/The_Mail_on_Sunday \"The Mail on Sunday\")_ rated it as\n\"the most imaginative debut since [Roald Dahl](/wiki/Roald_Dahl \"Roald\nDahl\")\",[127] a view echoed by _[The Sunday Times](/wiki/The_Sunday_Times \"The\nSunday Times\")_ (\"comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified\"),[127] while\n_[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_ called it \"a richly\ntextured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit\".[127]\n\nBy the time of the release of the fifth book, _Harry Potter and the Order of\nthe Phoenix,_ the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of\nliterary scholars. Yale professor, literary scholar, and critic [Harold\nBloom](/wiki/Harold_Bloom \"Harold Bloom\") raised criticisms of the books'\nliterary merits, saying, \"Rowling's mind is so governed by clichés and dead\nmetaphors that she has no other style of writing.\"[128] [A. S.\nByatt](/wiki/A._S._Byatt \"A. S. Byatt\") authored an op-ed article in _The New\nYork Times_ calling Rowling's universe a \"secondary secondary world, made up\nof intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children's\nliterature ... written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV\ncartoons, and the exaggerated (more exciting, not threatening) mirror-worlds\nof soaps, reality TV and celebrity gossip\".[129]\n\n[Michael Rosen](/wiki/Michael_Rosen \"Michael Rosen\"), a novelist and poet,\nadvocated the books were not suited for children, who would be unable to grasp\nthe complex themes. Rosen also stated that \"J. K. Rowling is more of an adult\nwriter.\"[130] The critic [Anthony Holden](/wiki/Anthony_Holden \"Anthony\nHolden\") wrote in _[The Observer](/wiki/The_Observer \"The Observer\")_ on his\nexperience of judging _[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of\nAzkaban](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban \"Harry Potter and the\nPrisoner of Azkaban\")_ for the [1999 Whitbread\nAwards](/wiki/1999_Whitbread_Awards \"1999 Whitbread Awards\"). His overall view\nof the series was negative – \"the Potter saga was essentially patronising,\nconservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone\nBritain\", and he speaks of \"a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style\".[131]\n[Ursula K. Le Guin](/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin \"Ursula K. Le Guin\") said, \"I have\nno great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the\n'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it to find out\nwhat the fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively\nkid's fantasy crossed with a \"school novel\", good fare for its age group, but\nstylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-\nspirited.\"[132]\n\nBy contrast, author [Fay Weldon](/wiki/Fay_Weldon \"Fay Weldon\"), while\nadmitting that the series is \"not what the poets hoped for\", nevertheless goes\non to say, \"but this is not poetry, it is readable, saleable, everyday, useful\nprose\".[133] The literary critic A. N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series\nin _[The Times](/wiki/The_Times \"The Times\")_ , stating: \"There are not many\nwriters who have JK's [Dickensian](/wiki/Dickensian \"Dickensian\") ability to\nmake us turn the pages, to weep – openly, with tears splashing – and a few\npages later to laugh, at invariably good jokes ... We have lived through a\ndecade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest, funniest,\nscariest and most moving children's stories ever written\".[134] Charles Taylor\nof [Salon.com](/wiki/Salon.com \"Salon.com\"), who is primarily a movie\ncritic,[135] took issue with Byatt's criticisms in particular. While he\nconceded that she may have \"a valid cultural point – a teeny one – about the\nimpulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling\ncomplexities of art\",[136] he rejected her claims that the series is lacking\nin serious [literary merit](/wiki/Literary_merit \"Literary merit\") and that it\nowes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers. Taylor\nstressed the progressively darker tone of the books, shown by the murder of a\nclassmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and [social\nisolation](/wiki/Social_isolation \"Social isolation\") each causes. Taylor also\nargued that _Philosopher 's Stone_, said to be the most light-hearted of the\nseven published books, disrupts the childhood reassurances that Byatt claims\nspur the series' success: the book opens with news of a [double\nmurder](/wiki/Double_murder \"Double murder\"), for example.[136]\n\n[Stephen King](/wiki/Stephen_King \"Stephen King\") called the series \"a feat of\nwhich only a superior imagination is capable\", and declared \"Rowling's\npunning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor\" to be \"remarkable\". However, he\nwrote that despite the story being \"a good one\", he is \"a little tired of\ndiscovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle\", the formulaic\nbeginning of all seven books.[38] King has also joked that \"Rowling's never\nmet an adverb she did not like!\" He does however predict that Harry Potter\n\"will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are\nkept; I think Harry will take his place with\n[Alice](/wiki/Alice_\\(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland\\) \"Alice \\(Alice's\nAdventures in Wonderland\\)\"), [Huck](/wiki/Huckleberry_Finn \"Huckleberry\nFinn\"), [Frodo](/wiki/Frodo_Baggins \"Frodo Baggins\"), and\n[Dorothy](/wiki/Dorothy_Gale \"Dorothy Gale\") and this is one series not just\nfor the decade, but for the ages\".[137] Sameer Rahim of _[The Daily\nTelegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph \"The Daily Telegraph\")_ disagreed, saying\n\"It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year-olds reading the series when they could\nbe reading the great novels of childhood such as _[Oliver\nTwist](/wiki/Oliver_Twist \"Oliver Twist\")_ or _[A House for Mr\nBiswas](/wiki/A_House_for_Mr_Biswas \"A House for Mr Biswas\")_. What that says\nabout the adults who are fanatical fans I'm not sure – but I suspect in years\nto come people will make a link between our plump, comfortable, infantilising\nsociety and the popularity of Potter.\"[138]\n\nThere is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which the series was\ninspired by [Tolkien](/wiki/Tolkien \"Tolkien\")'s _Lord of the Rings_\nbooks.[139]\n\n### Social impact\n\nAlthough [_Time_ magazine](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\") named\nRowling as a runner-up for its 2007 [Person of the\nYear](/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year \"Time Person of the Year\") award, noting\nthe social, moral, and [political inspiration](/wiki/Politics_of_Harry_Potter\n\"Politics of Harry Potter\") she has given [her\nfandom](/wiki/Harry_Potter_fandom \"Harry Potter fandom\"),[140] cultural\ncomments on the series have been mixed. _[Washington\nPost](/wiki/Washington_Post \"Washington Post\")_ book critic [Ron\nCharles](/wiki/Ron_Charles_\\(critic\\) \"Ron Charles \\(critic\\)\") opined in July\n2007 that the large numbers of adults reading the _Potter_ series but few\nother books may represent a \"bad case of cultural infantilism\", and that the\nstraightforward \"good vs. evil\" theme of the series is \"childish\". He also\nargued \"through no fault of Rowling's\", the cultural and marketing \"hysteria\"\nmarked by the publication of the later books \"trains children and adults to\nexpect the roar of the coliseum, a mass-media experience that no other novel\ncan possibly provide\".[141]\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp pointed out the books' potential to improve\n[literacy](/wiki/Literacy \"Literacy\") by motivating children to read much more\nthan they otherwise would.[142] The seven-book series has a word count of\n1,083,594 (US edition). Agreeing about the motivating effects, Diane Penrod\nalso praised the books' blending of simple entertainment with \"the qualities\nof highbrow literary fiction\", but expressed concern about the distracting\neffect of the prolific [merchandising](/wiki/Merchandising \"Merchandising\")\nthat accompanies the book launches.[143] However, the assumption that Harry\nPotter books have increased literacy among young people is \"largely a folk\nlegend.\"[144] Research by the [National Endowment for the\nArts](/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts \"National Endowment for the Arts\")\n(NEA) has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the\nHarry Potter publishing phenomenon, nor has the broader downward trend in\nreading among Americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the\nHarry Potter books.[144][145] The research also found that children who read\nHarry Potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy\nand mystery genres.[144] NEA chairman [Dana Gioia](/wiki/Dana_Gioia \"Dana\nGioia\") said the series, \"got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably\ncomplex series of books. The trouble is that one Harry Potter novel every few\nyears is not enough to reverse the decline in reading.\"[146]\n\nJennifer Conn used Snape's and Quidditch coach Madam Hooch's teaching methods\nas examples of what to avoid and what to emulate in clinical teaching,[147]\nand Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics\nin a typical first-year sociology class: \"sociological concepts including\nculture, society, and [socialisation](/wiki/Socialisation \"Socialisation\");\n[stratification](/wiki/Social_stratification \"Social stratification\") and\n[social inequality](/wiki/Social_inequality \"Social inequality\"); [social\ninstitutions](/wiki/Social_institutions \"Social institutions\"); and [social\ntheory](/wiki/Social_theory \"Social theory\")\".[148]\n\nFrom the early 2000s onwards several news reports appeared in the UK of the\nHarry Potter book and movie series driving demand for pet owls[149] and even\nreports that after the end of the movie series these same pet owls were now\nbeing abandoned by their owners.[150] This led J. K. Rowling to issue several\nstatements urging Harry Potter fans to refrain from purchasing pet owls.[151]\nDespite the media flurry, research into the popularity of Harry Potter and\nsales of owls in the UK failed to find any evidence that the Harry Potter\nfranchise had influenced the buying of owls in the country or the number of\nowls reaching animal shelters and sanctuaries.[152]\n\nJenny Sawyer wrote in _[Christian Science\nMonitor](/wiki/Christian_Science_Monitor \"Christian Science Monitor\")_ on 25\nJuly 2007 that the books represent a \"disturbing trend in commercial\nstorytelling and Western society\" in that stories \"moral center [sic] have all\nbut vanished from much of today's [pop culture](/wiki/Popular_culture \"Popular\nculture\") ... after 10 years, 4,195 pages, and over 375 million copies, J. K.\nRowling's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great\nchildren's literature: the hero's moral journey\". Harry Potter, Sawyer argues,\nneither faces a \"moral struggle\" nor undergoes any ethical growth, and is thus\n\"no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than\nblack and white\".[153] In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry's first\npassage through to [Platform 9¾](/wiki/Platform_9%C2%BE \"Platform 9¾\") as an\napplication of faith and hope, and his encounter with the [Sorting\nHat](/wiki/Sorting_Hat \"Sorting Hat\") as the first of many in which Harry is\nshaped by the choices he makes. She also noted the \"deeper magic\" by which the\nself-sacrifice of Harry's mother protects the boy throughout the series, and\nwhich the power-hungry [Voldemort](/wiki/Voldemort \"Voldemort\") fails to\nunderstand.[154]\n\nIn an 8 November 2002 _[Slate](/wiki/Slate_\\(magazine\\) \"Slate \\(magazine\\)\")_\narticle, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a \"trust-fund kid whose success\nat school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives\nlavish upon him\". Noting that in Rowling's fiction, magical ability potential\nis \"something you are born to, not something you can achieve\", Suellentrop\nwrote that Dumbledore's maxim that \"It is our choices that show what we truly\nare, far more than our abilities\" is hypocritical, as \"the school that\nDumbledore runs values native gifts above all else\".[155] In a 12 August 2007,\nreview of _Deathly Hallows_ in _The New York Times_ , however, [Christopher\nHitchens](/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens \"Christopher Hitchens\") praised Rowling\nfor \"unmooring\" her \"English school story\" from literary precedents \"bound up\nwith dreams of wealth and class and snobbery\", arguing that she had instead\ncreated \"a world of youthful democracy and diversity\".[156]\n\nIn 2010, coinciding with the release of the film _Harry Potter and the Deathly\nHallows Part 1,_ a series of articles were written about Private Harry Potter\nof the British army.[157] This real-life Harry Potter was killed in the [Arab\nRevolt](/wiki/1936%E2%80%9339_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine \"1936–39 Arab revolt in\nPalestine\") near Hebron in 1939. His grave, located in the British cemetery in\n[Ramla](/wiki/Ramla \"Ramla\"), [Israel](/wiki/Israel \"Israel\"), began to\nreceive curious visitors leading the Ramla Municipality to list it on their\nwebsite.[158]\n\nIn 2016, an article written by [Diana C. Mutz](/wiki/Diana_Mutz \"Diana Mutz\")\ncompares the politics of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential\ncampaign.

The popularity and high [market\nvalue](/wiki/Market_value \"Market value\") of the series has led Rowling, her\npublishers, and film distributor [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner\nBros.\") to take legal measures to protect their copyright, which have included\nbanning the sale of _Harry Potter_ imitations, targeting the owners of\nwebsites over the \"Harry Potter\" [domain name](/wiki/Domain_name \"Domain\nname\"), and suing author [Nancy Stouffer](/wiki/Nancy_Stouffer \"Nancy\nStouffer\") to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her\nwork.[160][161][162] Various religious conservatives have claimed that the\nbooks promote witchcraft and religions such as [Wicca](/wiki/Wicca \"Wicca\")\nand are therefore unsuitable for children,[163][164] while a number of critics\nhave criticised the books for promoting various political agendas.[165][166]\n\nThe books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds.\nFrom 1997 to 1998, _[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher's Stone\")_ won almost all the UK awards judged by children, but\nnone of the children's book awards judged by adults,[167] and Sandra Beckett\nsuggested the reason was [intellectual snobbery](/wiki/Intellectual_snobbery\n\"Intellectual snobbery\") towards books that were popular among children.[168]\nIn 1999, the winner of the [Whitbread Book of the Year\naward](/wiki/Whitbread_Book_Award \"Whitbread Book Award\") children's division\nwas entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award, and one\njudge threatened to resign if _[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of\nAzkaban](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban \"Harry Potter and the\nPrisoner of Azkaban\")_ was declared the overall winner; it finished second,\nvery close behind the winner of the poetry prize, [Seamus\nHeaney](/wiki/Seamus_Heaney \"Seamus Heaney\")'s translation of the [Anglo-\nSaxon](/wiki/Anglo-Saxon \"Anglo-Saxon\") [epic](/wiki/Epic_poetry \"Epic\npoetry\") _[Beowulf](/wiki/Beowulf \"Beowulf\")_.[168]\n\nIn 2000, shortly before the publication of _[Harry Potter and the Goblet of\nFire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire \"Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire\")_ , the previous three _Harry Potter_ books topped _The New York\nTimes_ fiction best-seller list and a third of the entries were children's\nbooks. The newspaper created a new children's section covering children's\nbooks, including both fiction and non-fiction, and initially counting only\nhardback sales. The move was supported by publishers and booksellers.[107] In\n2004, _The New York Times_ further split the children's list, which was still\ndominated by _Harry Potter_ books into sections for series and individual\nbooks, and removed the _Harry Potter_ books from the section for individual\nbooks.[169] The split in 2000 attracted condemnation, praise and some comments\nthat presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move.[170] _Time_\nsuggested that, on the same principle, Billboard should have created a\nseparate \"[mop-tops](/wiki/Mop-top \"Mop-top\")\" list in 1964 when the\n[Beatles](/wiki/Beatles \"Beatles\") held the top five places in its list, and\n[Nielsen](/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research \"Nielsen Media Research\") should have\ncreated a separate game-show list when _[Who Wants to Be a\nMillionaire?](/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire%3F \"Who Wants to Be a\nMillionaire?\")_ dominated the [ratings](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings \"Nielsen\nratings\").[171]\n\n## Adaptations\n\n### Films\n\nMain article: [Harry Potter (film series)](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(film_series\\)\n\"Harry Potter \\(film series\\)\")\n\n[![The red locomotive train used as the \"Hogwarts Express\" in the film series.\nIn the front it has the numbers \"5912\" inscripted on\nit](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/GWR_%27Hall%27_5972_%27Olton_Hall%27_at_Doncaster_Works.JPG/220px-\nGWR_%27Hall%27_5972_%27Olton_Hall%27_at_Doncaster_Works.JPG)](/wiki/File:GWR_%27Hall%27_5972_%27Olton_Hall%27_at_Doncaster_Works.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GWR_%27Hall%27_5972_%27Olton_Hall%27_at_Doncaster_Works.JPG\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe locomotive that features as the \"Hogwarts Express\" in the film series.\n\nIn 1998, Rowling sold the film rights of the first four _Harry Potter_ books\nto [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") for a reported £1 million\n($1,982,900).[172][173] Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly\nBritish, nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as the\nlate [Richard Harris](/wiki/Richard_Harris_\\(actor\\) \"Richard Harris\n\\(actor\\)\") as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European\nactors in _[Harry Potter and the Goblet of\nFire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire \"Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire\")_ where characters from the book are specified as such.[174] After\nmany directors including [Steven Spielberg](/wiki/Steven_Spielberg \"Steven\nSpielberg\"), [Terry Gilliam](/wiki/Terry_Gilliam#Gilliam_and_Harry_Potter\n\"Terry Gilliam\"), [Jonathan Demme](/wiki/Jonathan_Demme \"Jonathan Demme\"), and\n[Alan Parker](/wiki/Alan_Parker \"Alan Parker\") were considered, [Chris\nColumbus](/wiki/Chris_Columbus_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Chris Columbus \\(filmmaker\\)\")\nwas appointed on 28 March 2000 as the director for _[Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher's Stone](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_\\(film\\)\n\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone \\(film\\)\")_ (titled \"_Harry Potter\nand the Sorcerer 's Stone_\" in the United States), with Warner Bros. citing\nhis work on other family films such as _[Home Alone](/wiki/Home_Alone \"Home\nAlone\")_ and _[Mrs. Doubtfire](/wiki/Mrs._Doubtfire \"Mrs. Doubtfire\")_ and\nproven experience with directing children as influences for their\ndecision.[175]\n\nAfter [extensive casting](/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_films_cast_members \"List\nof Harry Potter films cast members\"), filming began in October 2000 at\n[Leavesden Film Studios](/wiki/Leavesden_Film_Studios \"Leavesden Film\nStudios\") and in London itself, with production ending in July 2001.[176][177]\n_Philosopher 's Stone_ was released on 14 November 2001.
