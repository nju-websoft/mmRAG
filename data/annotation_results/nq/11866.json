Record executive Irving Azoff offered Lee the chance to record\n\"Lookin' For Love\", a song that 20-plus artists had rejected.[1]\n\nCritics were not kind to Lee nor the song. Country music historian Bill Malone\nonce noted that \"Lookin' for Love\"—in his words, a \"lilting little pop song\" —\nbecame the featured song of _Urban Cowboy_ and a huge commercial hit largely\nbecause \"actor [John Travolta](/wiki/John_Travolta \"John Travolta\") (the\nmovie's co-star) expressed a liking for it.\"[2] Critic Kurt Wolff panned the\nsong as an example of \"watered-down cowboy music.\"[3]\n\nPublic reaction was much better. \"Lookin' for Love\" rose to No. 1 (for a\nthree-week stay) on the _[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ [Hot Country Singles](/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs \"Hot Country\nSongs\") chart, and was a No. 5 [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100\n\"Billboard Hot 100\") hit as well.
