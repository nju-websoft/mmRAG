It has, for example, been applied to both states and territories.

The\n[capital](/wiki/List_of_capitals_in_the_United_States \"List of capitals in the\nUnited States\") and [most populous city](/wiki/Municipalities_of_Puerto_Rico\n\"Municipalities of Puerto Rico\") is [San Juan](/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico\n\"San Juan, Puerto Rico\"). Its official languages are\n[Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_language \"Spanish language\") and\n[English](/wiki/English_language \"English language\"), though Spanish\npredominates.[21] The island's population is approximately 3.4 million. Puerto\nRico's history, tropical climate, natural scenery, [traditional\ncuisine](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_cuisine \"Puerto Rican cuisine\"), and [tax\nincentives](/wiki/Taxation_in_Puerto_Rico \"Taxation in Puerto Rico\") make it a\ndestination for travelers from around the world.\n\nOriginally populated by the\n[indigenous](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas \"Indigenous peoples of\nthe Americas\") [Taíno](/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno \"Taíno\") people, the island was\nclaimed in 1493 by [Christopher Columbus](/wiki/Christopher_Columbus\n\"Christopher Columbus\") for [Spain](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\") during his second\nvoyage. Later it endured invasion attempts from the French, Dutch, and\nBritish. Four centuries of Spanish colonial government influenced the island's\ncultural landscapes with waves of [African\nslaves](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Spanish_New_World_colonies \"Slavery in the\nSpanish New World colonies\"), [Canarian](/wiki/Canarian \"Canarian\"), and\n[Andalusian](/wiki/Andalusian_people \"Andalusian people\") settlers. In the\n[Spanish Empire](/wiki/Spanish_Empire \"Spanish Empire\"), Puerto Rico played a\nsecondary, but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like\n[Peru](/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_Peru \"Viceroyalty of Peru\") and the mainland parts\nof [New Spain](/wiki/New_Spain \"New Spain\").[22][23] Spain's distant\nadministrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century, helping to\nproduce a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined\nelements from the Native Americans, Africans, and Iberians.[24] In 1898,\nfollowing the [Spanish–American War](/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War\n\"Spanish–American War\"), the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United\nStates\") acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the [Treaty of\nParis](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\\(1898\\) \"Treaty of Paris \\(1898\\)\"). The treaty\ntook effect on April 11, 1899.[4]\n\n[Puerto Ricans](/wiki/Puerto_Ricans \"Puerto Ricans\") are by law [citizens of\nthe United States](/wiki/United_States_nationality_law \"United States\nnationality law\") and may move freely between the island and the mainland.[25]\nAs it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the [United States\nCongress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\"), which\ngoverns the territory with full jurisdiction under the [Puerto Rico Federal\nRelations Act of 1950](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Federal_Relations_Act_of_1950 \"Puerto\nRico Federal Relations Act of 1950\"). However, Puerto Rico does have one [non-\nvoting member of the House](/wiki/Non-\nvoting_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Non-voting\nmembers of the United States House of Representatives\") called a Resident\nCommissioner. As residents of a [U.S.\nterritory](/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States \"Territories of the United\nStates\"), American citizens in Puerto Rico are [disenfranchised at the\nnational\nlevel](/wiki/Federal_voting_rights_in_Puerto_Rico#Disenfranchisement_in_Puerto_Rico\n\"Federal voting rights in Puerto Rico\") and do not [vote for president and\nvice president of the United States](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election\n\"United States presidential election\"),[26] and do not pay federal income tax\non Puerto Rican income. Like other territories and the [District of\nColumbia](/wiki/District_of_Columbia \"District of Columbia\"), Puerto Rico does\nnot have [U.S. senators](/wiki/U.S._senate \"U.S. senate\"). Congress approved\n[a local constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Puerto_Rico \"Constitution of\nPuerto Rico\") in 1952, allowing U.S. citizens on the territory to elect [a\ngovernor](/wiki/Governor_of_Puerto_Rico \"Governor of Puerto Rico\"). A [2012\nreferendum](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2012 \"Puerto Rican status\nreferendum, 2012\") showed a majority (54% of those who voted) disagreed with\n\"the present form of territorial status\". A second question asking about a new\nmodel, had full statehood the preferred option among those who voted for a\nchange of status, although a significant number of people did not answer the\nsecond question of the referendum.[27] A [fifth\nreferendum](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2017 \"Puerto Rican status\nreferendum, 2017\") was held on June 11, 2017, with \"Statehood\" and\n\"Independence/Free Association\" initially as the only available choices. At\nthe recommendation of the Department of Justice, an option for the \"current\nterritorial status\" was added.[28] The referendum showed an overwhelming\nsupport for statehood, with 97.18% voting for it, although the voter turnout\nhad a historically low figure of only 22.99% of the registered voters casting\ntheir ballots.\n\nIn early 2017, the [Puerto Rican government-debt\ncrisis](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_government-debt_crisis \"Puerto Rican government-\ndebt crisis\") posed serious problems for the government. The outstanding bond\ndebt had climbed to $70 billion at a time with 12.4% unemployment. The debt\nhad been increasing during a decade long recession.[29] This was the second\nmajor financial crisis to affect the island after the Great Depression when\nthe U.S. government, in 1935, provided relief efforts through the [Puerto Rico\nReconstruction Administration](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Reconstruction_Administration\n\"Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration\").[30] On May 3, 2017, Puerto\nRico's financial oversight board in the [U.S. District Court for Puerto\nRico](/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Puerto_Rico\n\"United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\") filed the debt\nrestructuring petition which was made under Title III of\n[PROMESA](/wiki/PROMESA \"PROMESA\").[31] By early August 2017, the debt was $72\nbillion with a 45% poverty rate.[32]\n\nIn late September 2017, [Hurricane Maria](/wiki/Hurricane_Maria \"Hurricane\nMaria\") made landfall in Puerto Rico, causing devastating damage.[33] The\nisland's [electrical grid](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Electric_Power_Authority \"Puerto\nRico Electric Power Authority\") was largely destroyed, with repairs expected\nto take months to complete, provoking the largest [power\noutage](/wiki/Power_outage \"Power outage\") in American history.[34] Recovery\nefforts were somewhat slow in the first few months, and over 200,000 residents\nhad moved to Florida alone by late November 2017.[35]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Etymology\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Pre-Columbian era\n    * 2.2 Spanish colony (1493–1898)\n      * 2.2.1 Conquest and early settlement\n      * 2.2.2 Colonization, the Habsburgs\n      * 2.2.3 Late colonial period\n      * 2.2.4 Politics of liberalism\n    * 2.3 American era (1898–present)\n      * 2.3.1 United States unincorporated organized territory (1900–1952)\n        * 2.3.1.1 U.S. citizenship and Puerto Rican citizenship\n      * 2.3.2 United States unincorporated organized territory with commonwealth constitution (1952–present)\n      * 2.3.3 _Estado Libre Asociado_\n    * 2.4 Referendums on statehood or independence\n    * 2.5 United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization\n      * 2.5.1 International status\n    * 2.6 21st century\n    * 2.7 Political status\n    * 2.8 Hurricane Maria\n      * 2.8.1 Rebuilding efforts\n      * 2.8.2 Death toll\n  * 3 Geography\n    * 3.1 Climate\n    * 3.2 Biodiversity\n  * 4 Demographics\n    * 4.1 Population makeup\n      * 4.1.1 Population genetics\n    * 4.2 Immigration and emigration\n    * 4.3 Population distribution\n    * 4.4 Languages\n    * 4.5 Religion\n  * 5 Government\n    * 5.1 Political parties and elections\n    * 5.2 Law\n    * 5.3 Political status\n      * 5.3.1 Within the United States\n    * 5.4 Foreign and intergovernmental relations\n    * 5.5 Military\n    * 5.6 Administrative divisions\n  * 6 Economy\n    * 6.1 Heavy debt load\n    * 6.2 Public finances\n    * 6.3 Cost of living\n  * 7 Education\n  * 8 Public health and safety\n    * 8.1 Crime\n  * 9 Culture\n    * 9.1 Architecture\n    * 9.2 Arts\n    * 9.3 Literature\n    * 9.4 Media\n    * 9.5 Music\n    * 9.6 Cuisine\n    * 9.7 Philately\n    * 9.8 Sports\n  * 10 Infrastructure\n  * 11 See also\n  * 12 Notes\n  * 13 References\n  * 14 Further reading\n  * 15 External links\n\n## Etymology\n\nPuerto Rico means \"rich port\" in Spanish. [Puerto\nRicans](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_people \"Puerto Rican people\") often call the island\n__Borinquén__ – a derivation of __Borikén__ , its\n[indigenous](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples \"Indigenous peoples\")\n[Taíno](/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno \"Taíno\") name, which means \"Land of the Valiant\nLord\".[36][37][38] The terms __boricua__ and __borincano__ derive from\n__Borikén__ and __Borinquen__ respectively, and are commonly used to identify\nsomeone of Puerto Rican heritage.

Scarce archaeological findings and\nearly Spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known\nabout them. The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was\nwritten by [Fray Íñigo Abbad y\nLasierra](/wiki/Fray_%C3%8D%C3%B1igo_Abbad_y_Lasierra \"Fray Íñigo Abbad y\nLasierra\") in 1786, nearly three centuries after the first Spaniards landed on\nthe island.[43]\n\nThe first known settlers were the [Ortoiroid people](/wiki/Ortoiroid_people\n\"Ortoiroid people\"), an [Archaic Period](/wiki/Archaic_period_in_the_Americas\n\"Archaic period in the Americas\") culture of\n[Amerindian](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas \"Indigenous peoples of\nthe Americas\") hunters and fishermen who migrated from the South American\nmainland. Some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000\nyears.[44] An archeological dig in 1990 on the island of\n[Vieques](/wiki/Vieques,_Puerto_Rico \"Vieques, Puerto Rico\") found the remains\nof a man, designated as the \"Puerto Ferro Man\", which was dated to around 2000\nBC.[45] The [Ortoiroid](/wiki/Ortoiroid_people \"Ortoiroid people\") were\ndisplaced by the [Saladoid](/wiki/Saladoid \"Saladoid\"), a culture from the\nsame region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC.[44]\n\nThe [Igneri](/wiki/Igneri \"Igneri\") tribe migrated to Puerto Rico between 120\nand 400 AD from the region of the [Orinoco](/wiki/Orinoco \"Orinoco\") river in\nnorthern South America.

They called it _Borikén_\n(_Borinquen_ in Spanish transliteration). Columbus named the island San Juan\nBautista, in honor of St [John the Baptist](/wiki/John_the_Baptist \"John the\nBaptist\"). [e] Having reported the findings of his first travel, Columbus\nbrought with him this time a letter from King Ferdinand[49] empowered by a\n[papal bull](/wiki/Inter_caetera \"Inter caetera\") that authorized any course\nof action necessary for the expansion of the [Spanish\nEmpire](/wiki/Spanish_Empire \"Spanish Empire\") and the Christian faith. [Juan\nPonce de León](/wiki/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n \"Juan Ponce de León\"), a\n[lieutenant](/wiki/Lieutenant \"Lieutenant\") under Columbus, founded the first\nSpanish settlement, [Caparra](/wiki/Caparra_Archaeological_Site \"Caparra\nArchaeological Site\"), on August 8, 1508. He later served as the first\n[governor](/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Puerto_Rico \"List of Governors of Puerto\nRico\") of the island.[f] Eventually, traders and other maritime visitors came\nto refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, and San Juan became the name of\nthe main trading/shipping port.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, the Spanish people began to colonize the\nisland. Despite the [Laws of Burgos](/wiki/Laws_of_Burgos \"Laws of Burgos\") of\n1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population, some\nTaíno Indians were forced into an [encomienda](/wiki/Encomienda \"Encomienda\")\nsystem of [forced labor](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Spanish_New_World_colonies\n\"Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies\") in the early years of\ncolonization. The population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics\nof European [infectious](/wiki/Infectious \"Infectious\")\ndiseases.[g][h][i][j][k]\n\n#### Colonization, the Habsburgs\n\nIn 1520, [King Charles I of Spain](/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\n\"Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor\") issued a royal decree collectively\nemancipating the remaining Taíno population. By that time, the Taíno people\nwere few in number.[57] Enslaved Africans had already begun to be imported to\ncompensate for the native labor loss, but their numbers were proportionate to\nthe diminished commercial interest Spain soon began to demonstrate for the\nisland colony. Other nearby islands, like Cuba, Saint-Domingue, and\nGuadeloupe, attracted more of the slave trade than Puerto Rico, probably\nbecause of greater agricultural interests in those islands, on which colonists\nhad developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the\nAtlantic slave trade.[58]\n\nFrom the beginning of the country, the colonial administration relied heavily\non the industry of enslaved Africans and creole blacks for public works and\ndefenses, primarily in coastal ports and cities, where the tiny colonial\npopulation had hunkered down. With no significant industries or large-scale\nagricultural production as yet, enslaved and free communities lodged around\nthe few littoral settlements, particularly around San Juan, also forming\nlasting Afro-creole communities. Meanwhile, in the island's interior, there\ndeveloped a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence\neconomy. This mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements\nwith foodstuffs and, in relative isolation, set the pattern for what later\nwould be known as the [Puerto Rican Jíbaro culture](/wiki/J%C3%ADbaro\n\"Jíbaro\"). By the end of the 16th century, the Spanish Empire was diminishing\nand, in the face of increasing raids from European competitors, the colonial\nadministration throughout [the Americas](/wiki/The_Americas \"The Americas\")\nfell into a \"bunker mentality\". Imperial strategists and urban planners\nredesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of\nprotecting Spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the\nking's silver-laden [Atlantic Fleet](/wiki/Spanish_treasure_fleet \"Spanish\ntreasure fleet\") to the [Iberian Peninsula](/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula \"Iberian\nPeninsula\"). San Juan served as an important port-of-call for ships driven\nacross the Atlantic by its powerful [trade winds](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean#Climate\n\"Atlantic Ocean\"). West Indies convoys linked Spain to the island, sailing\nbetween [Cádiz](/wiki/C%C3%A1diz \"Cádiz\") and the Spanish West Indies. The\ncolony's seat of government was on the forested [Islet of San\nJuan](/wiki/Isleta_de_San_Juan \"Isleta de San Juan\") and for a time became one\nof the most heavily fortified settlements in the [Spanish\nCaribbean](/wiki/Spanish_West_Indies \"Spanish West Indies\") earning the name\nof the \"Walled City\". The islet is still dotted with the various forts and\nwalls, such as [La Fortaleza](/wiki/La_Fortaleza \"La Fortaleza\"), [Castillo\nSan Felipe del Morro](/wiki/Castillo_San_Felipe_del_Morro \"Castillo San Felipe\ndel Morro\"), and [Castillo San\nCristóbal](/wiki/Castillo_San_Crist%C3%B3bal_\\(San_Juan\\) \"Castillo San\nCristóbal \\(San Juan\\)\"), designed to protect the population and the strategic\n[Port of San Juan](/wiki/Port_of_San_Juan \"Port of San Juan\") from the raids\nof the Spanish European competitors.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Hendricksz_1625_attack_on_San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico.jpg/300px-\nHendricksz_1625_attack_on_San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hendricksz_1625_attack_on_San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hendricksz_1625_attack_on_San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nHendricksz 1625 attack on San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nIn 1625, in the [Battle of San Juan](/wiki/Battle_of_San_Juan_\\(1625\\) \"Battle\nof San Juan \\(1625\\)\"), the [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_people \"Dutch people\")\ncommander [Boudewijn Hendricksz](/wiki/Boudewijn_Hendricksz \"Boudewijn\nHendricksz\") tested the defenses' limits like no one else before. Learning\nfrom [Francis Drake](/wiki/Francis_Drake \"Francis Drake\")'s previous [failures\nhere](/wiki/Battle_of_San_Juan_\\(1595\\) \"Battle of San Juan \\(1595\\)\"), he\ncircumvented the cannons of the castle of San Felipe del Morro and quickly\nbrought his 17 ships into the [San Juan Bay](/wiki/San_Juan_Bay \"San Juan\nBay\"). He then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population\nhurried for shelter behind the Morro's moat and high battlements. Historians\nconsider this event the worst attack on San Juan. Though the Dutch set the\nvillage on fire, they failed to conquer the Morro, and its batteries pounded\ntheir troops and ships until Hendricksz deemed the cause lost. Hendricksz's\nexpedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy. Constructions of\ndefenses for the San Cristóbal Hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the\nlanding of invaders out of reach of the Morro's artillery. Urban planning\nresponded to the needs of keeping the colony in Spanish hands.\n\n#### Late colonial period\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Hacienda_La_Fortuna_Francisco_Oller_1885_Brooklyn_Museum.jpg/220px-\nHacienda_La_Fortuna_Francisco_Oller_1885_Brooklyn_Museum.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hacienda_La_Fortuna_Francisco_Oller_1885_Brooklyn_Museum.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hacienda_La_Fortuna_Francisco_Oller_1885_Brooklyn_Museum.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n_Hacienda La Fortuna_.

With the advent of the lively Bourbon Dynasty in Spain in the 1700s,\nthe island of Puerto Rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention.\nMore roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal\ncities, and coastal settlements like Arecibo, Mayaguez, and Ponce began\nacquiring importance of their own, separate from San Juan. By the end of the\n18th century, merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the\ntight regulations of the Mercantilist system, which turned each colony solely\ntoward the European metropole and limited contact with other nations. U.S.\nships came to surpass Spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation\nof the island's natural resources. Slavers, which had made but few stops on\nthe island before, began selling more enslaved Africans to growing sugar and\ncoffee plantations. The increasing number of Atlantic wars in which the\nCaribbean islands played major roles, like the [War of Jenkins'\nEar](/wiki/War_of_Jenkins%27_Ear \"War of Jenkins' Ear\"), the [Seven Years'\nWar](/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War \"Seven Years' War\") and the [Atlantic\nRevolutions](/wiki/Atlantic_Revolutions \"Atlantic Revolutions\"), ensured\nPuerto Rico's growing esteem in Madrid's eyes. On April 17, 1797, Sir [Ralph\nAbercromby](/wiki/Ralph_Abercromby \"Ralph Abercromby\")’s fleet invaded the\nisland with a force of 6,000–13,000 men,[59] which included German soldiers\nand Royal Marines and 60 to 64 ships. Fierce fighting continued for the next\ndays with Spanish troops. Both sides suffered heavy losses. On Sunday April 30\nthe British ceased their attack and began their retreat from San Juan. By the\ntime independence movements in the larger Spanish colonies gained success, new\nwaves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in Puerto Rico, helping to\ntilt the island's political balance toward the Crown.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/EAGLE_Old_San_Juan_2014.jpg/300px-\nEAGLE_Old_San_Juan_2014.jpg)](/wiki/File:EAGLE_Old_San_Juan_2014.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:EAGLE_Old_San_Juan_2014.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe 16th-century fort, [Castillo San Felipe del\nMorro](/wiki/Castillo_San_Felipe_del_Morro \"Castillo San Felipe del Morro\"),\nin San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nIn 1809, to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the\nEuropean [Peninsular War](/wiki/Peninsular_War \"Peninsular War\"), the [Supreme\nCentral Junta](/wiki/Junta_\\(Peninsular_War\\) \"Junta \\(Peninsular War\\)\")\nbased in [Cádiz](/wiki/C%C3%A1diz \"Cádiz\") recognized Puerto Rico as an\noverseas province of Spain.

The movement was largely inspired by the ideals of [Simón\nBolívar](/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar \"Simón Bolívar\") in establishing a\n[United Provinces of New Granada](/wiki/United_Provinces_of_New_Granada\n\"United Provinces of New Granada\") and [Venezuela](/wiki/Venezuela\n\"Venezuela\"), that included Puerto Rico and Cuba.

The movement was discovered, and Governor\n[Miguel de la Torre](/wiki/Miguel_de_la_Torre \"Miguel de la Torre\") had its\nmembers imprisoned or exiled.[61]\n\nWith the increasingly rapid growth of independent former Spanish colonies in\nthe South and Central American states in the first part of the 19th century,\nthe Spanish Crown considered Puerto Rico and Cuba of strategic importance. To\nincrease its hold on its last two New World colonies, the Spanish Crown\nrevived the [Royal Decree of Graces of\n1815](/wiki/Royal_Decree_of_Graces_of_1815 \"Royal Decree of Graces of 1815\")\nas a result of which 450,000 immigrants, mainly Spaniards, settled on the\nisland in the period up until the American conquest. Printed in three\nlanguages—Spanish, English, and French—it was intended to also attract non-\nSpanish Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose\ntheir popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the Crown.

Except for one 1895 plan, which\nrecommended annexation of the island then named _Isle of Pines_ (later renamed\nas [Isla de la Juventud](/wiki/Isla_de_la_Juventud \"Isla de la Juventud\")), a\nrecommendation dropped in later planning, plans developed for attacks on\nSpanish territories were intended as support operations against Spain's forces\nin and around Cuba.[70] Recent research suggests that the U.S. did consider\nPuerto Rico valuable as a naval station, and recognized that it and Cuba\ngenerated lucrative crops of sugar – a valuable commercial commodity which the\nUnited States lacked,[71] before the development of the [sugar\nbeet](/wiki/Sugar_beet \"Sugar beet\") industry in the United States.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Children_in_a_company_housing_settlement%2C_Puerto_Rico_1a34030u.jpg/260px-\nChildren_in_a_company_housing_settlement%2C_Puerto_Rico_1a34030u.jpg)](/wiki/File:Children_in_a_company_housing_settlement,_Puerto_Rico_1a34030u.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Children_in_a_company_housing_settlement,_Puerto_Rico_1a34030u.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nChildren in a company housing settlement, 1941\n\nOn July 25, 1898, during the [Spanish–American\nWar](/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War \"Spanish–American War\"), the U.S.\ninvaded Puerto Rico with a landing at\n[Guánica](/wiki/Gu%C3%A1nica,_Puerto_Rico \"Guánica, Puerto Rico\").

It was authorized a non-voting\nmember of Congress, by the title of \"Resident Commissioner\", who was\nappointed. In addition, this Act extended all U.S. laws \"not locally\ninapplicable\" to Puerto Rico, specifying, in particular, exemption from U.S.\nInternal Revenue laws.[74]\n\nThe Act empowered the civil government to legislate on \"all matters of\nlegislative character not locally inapplicable\", including the power to modify\nand repeal any laws then in existence in Puerto Rico, though the U.S. Congress\nretained the power to annul acts of the Puerto Rico legislature.[74][75]\nDuring an address to the Puerto Rican legislature in 1906, President [Theodore\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\") recommended that\nPuerto Ricans become U.S. citizens.[74][76]\n\nIn 1914, the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously in favor of\nindependence from the United States, but this was rejected by the U.S.\nCongress as \"unconstitutional\", and in violation of the 1900 [Foraker\nAct](/wiki/Foraker_Act \"Foraker Act\").[77]\n\n##### U.S. citizenship and Puerto Rican citizenship\n\nIn 1917, the U.S. Congress passed the [Jones–Shafroth\nAct](/wiki/Jones%E2%80%93Shafroth_Act \"Jones–Shafroth Act\"), popularly called\nthe Jones Act, which granted Puerto Ricans, born on or after, April 25, 1898,\nU.S. citizenship.[78] Opponents, which included all of the Puerto Rican House\nof Delegates, who voted unanimously against it, said that the U.S. imposed\ncitizenship in order to draft Puerto Rican men into the army as [American\nentry into World War I](/wiki/American_entry_into_World_War_I \"American entry\ninto World War I\") became likely.[77]\n\nThe same Act provided for a popularly elected Senate to complete a bicameral\nLegislative Assembly, as well as a [bill of rights](/wiki/Bill_of_rights \"Bill\nof rights\").

All the Puerto Rican\nparties supported the bill, but Muñoz Marín opposed it.

The commission\nwas led by [Arthur Garfield Hays](/wiki/Arthur_Garfield_Hays \"Arthur Garfield\nHays\"), counsel to the [American Civil Liberties\nUnion](/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union \"American Civil Liberties\nUnion\").[81]\n\nNineteen people were killed and over 200 were badly wounded, many in their\nbacks while running away.[82][83] The Hays Commission declared it a\n[massacre](/wiki/List_of_events_named_massacres \"List of events named\nmassacres\") and police mob action,[82] and it has since been known as the\n[Ponce massacre](/wiki/Ponce_massacre \"Ponce massacre\"). In the aftermath, on\nApril 2, 1943, Tydings introduced a bill in Congress calling for independence\nfor Puerto Rico. This bill ultimately was defeated.[74]\n\nDuring the latter years of the [Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt\n\"Franklin D. Roosevelt\")–[Truman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S.

The Senate\nat the time was controlled by the [Popular Democratic\nParty](/wiki/Popular_Democratic_Party_of_Puerto_Rico \"Popular Democratic Party\nof Puerto Rico\") (PPD), and was presided over by Luis Muñoz Marín.[84] The\nbill, also known as the [Gag Law](/wiki/Puerto_Rico%27s_Gag_Law \"Puerto Rico's\nGag Law\") ([Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_language \"Spanish language\"): _Ley de la\nMordaza_), was approved by the legislature on May 21, 1948. It made it illegal\nto display a Puerto Rican flag, to sing a pro-independence tune, to talk of\nindependence, or to campaign for independence.\n\nThe bill, which resembled [the Smith Act passed in the United\nStates](/wiki/Smith_Act \"Smith Act\"), was signed and made into law on June 10,\n1948, by the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico, [Jesús T.\nPiñero](/wiki/Jes%C3%BAs_T._Pi%C3%B1ero \"Jesús T.

According to Dr.\n[Leopoldo Figueroa](/wiki/Leopoldo_Figueroa \"Leopoldo Figueroa\"), a member of\nthe Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and in\nviolation of the First Amendment of the [U.S.\nConstitution](/wiki/U.S._Constitution \"U.S. Constitution\"), which guarantees\n[Freedom of Speech](/wiki/Freedom_of_Speech \"Freedom of Speech\"). He asserted\nthat the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of\nPuerto Rico. The law was repealed in 1957.[87]\n\n#### _Estado Libre Asociado_\n\nIn 1950, the U.S. Congress granted Puerto Ricans the right to organize a\n[constitutional\nconvention](/wiki/Constitutional_convention_\\(political_meeting\\)\n\"Constitutional convention \\(political meeting\\)\") via a referendum that gave\nthem the option of voting their preference, \"yes\" or \"no\", on a proposed U.S.\nlaw that would organize Puerto Rico as a \"commonwealth\" that would continue\nUnited States sovereignty over Puerto Rico and its people. Puerto Rico's\nelectorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second\nreferendum to ratify the constitution. The [Constitution of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Constitution_of_Puerto_Rico \"Constitution of Puerto Rico\") was\nformally adopted on July 3, 1952. The Constitutional Convention specified the\nname by which the [body politic](/wiki/Body_politic \"Body politic\") would be\nknown.\n\nOn February 4, 1952, the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in\nEnglish the word _[Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_\\(U.S._insular_area\\)\n\"Commonwealth \\(U.S. insular area\\)\")_ , meaning a \"politically organized\ncommunity\" or \"state\", which is simultaneously connected by a compact or\ntreaty to another political system. Puerto Rico officially designates itself\nwith the term \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" in its constitution, as a\ntranslation into English of the term to \"Estado Libre Asociado\" (ELA).\n\nIn 1967 Puerto Rico's Legislative Assembly polled the political preferences of\nthe Puerto Rican electorate by passing a [plebiscite](/wiki/Plebiscite\n\"Plebiscite\") act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico. This\nconstituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice among three\nstatus options (commonwealth, statehood, and independence). In subsequent\nplebiscites organized by Puerto Rico held in 1993 and 1998 (without any formal\ncommitment on the part of the U.S. Government to honor the results), the\ncurrent political status failed to receive majority support. In 1993,\nCommonwealth status won by a plurality of votes (48.6% versus 46.3% for\nstatehood), while the \"none of the above\" option, which was the [Popular\nDemocratic Party](/wiki/Popular_Democratic_Party_of_Puerto_Rico \"Popular\nDemocratic Party of Puerto Rico\")-sponsored choice, won in 1998 with 50.3% of\nthe votes (versus 46.5% for statehood). Disputes arose as to the definition of\neach of the ballot alternatives, and Commonwealth advocates, among others,\nreportedly urged a vote for \"none of the above\".[88][89][90]\n\nIn 1950, the U.S. Congress approved Public Law 600 (P.L. 81-600), which\nallowed for a democratic [referendum](/wiki/Referendum \"Referendum\") in Puerto\nRico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local\nconstitution.[91] This Act was meant to be adopted in the \"nature of a\ncompact\". It required congressional approval of the Puerto Rico Constitution\nbefore it could go into effect, and repealed certain sections of the Organic\nAct of 1917. The sections of this statute left in force were entitled the\n_Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act_.[92][93] U.S. Secretary of the Interior\n[Oscar L. Chapman](/wiki/Oscar_L._Chapman \"Oscar L. Chapman\"), under whose\nDepartment resided responsibility of Puerto Rican affairs, clarified the new\ncommonwealth status in this manner:\n\n“  | The bill (to permit Puerto Rico to write its own constitution) merely authorizes the people of Puerto Rico to adopt their own constitution and to organize a local government...The bill under consideration would not change Puerto Rico's political, social, and economic relationship to the United States.[94][95] | ”   \n---|---|---  \nExternal video [![Aguadilla\nPueblo.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Aguadilla_Pueblo.jpg/210px-\nAguadilla_Pueblo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Aguadilla_Pueblo.jpg)  \n---  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/16px-\nNuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png) [Puerto\nRico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_71hkXrTTf8), U.S. Embassy in Vienna,\nOctober 24, 2014  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/16px-\nNuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png) View newsreel scenes in Spanish of the [_Puerto\nRican Nationalist Party Revolts of the\n1950s_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfOJj0nmGEU) on\n[YouTube](/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\")  \n  \nOn October 30, 1950, [Pedro Albizu Campos](/wiki/Pedro_Albizu_Campos \"Pedro\nAlbizu Campos\") and other nationalists led a three-day revolt against the\nUnited States in various cities and towns of Puerto Rico, in what is known as\nthe [Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the\n1950s](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party_Revolts_of_the_1950s \"Puerto Rican\nNationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s\").

It was intended to transform Puerto Rico's economy from\nagriculture-based to manufacturing-based to provide more jobs. Puerto Rico has\nbecome a major tourist destination, as well as a global center for\npharmaceutical manufacturing.[101]\n\n### Referendums on statehood or independence\n\nFour referendums have been held since the late 20th century to resolve the\npolitical status. The [2012\nreferendum](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2012 \"Puerto Rican status\nreferendum, 2012\") showed a majority (54% of the voters) in favor of a change\nin status, with full statehood the preferred option of those who wanted a\nchange. Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012\nreferendum, creating confusion as to the voters' true desire, Congress decided\nto ignore the vote.[102][103]\n\nThe first three plebiscites provided voters with three options: statehood,\nfree association, and independence. The [Puerto Rican status referendum,\n2017](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2017 \"Puerto Rican status\nreferendum, 2017\") in June 2017 was going to offer only two options: Statehood\nand Independence/Free Association. However, a letter from the [Donald\nTrump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") administration recommended adding\nthe Commonwealth, the current status, in the plebiscite. The option had been\nremoved from this plebiscite in response to the results of the plebiscite in\n2012 which asked whether to remain in the current status and No had won. The\nTrump administration cited changes in demographics during the past 5 years to\nadd the option once again. Amendments to the plebiscite bill were adopted\nmaking ballot wording changes requested by the Department of Justice, as well\nas adding a \"current territorial status\" option.[104] While 97 percent voted\nin favor of statehood, the turnout was low; only some 23 percent voted.[105]\nAfter the ballots were counted the Justice Department was non-committal. The\nJustice Department had asked for the 2017 plebiscite to be postponed but the\nRosselló government chose not to do so. After the outcome was announced, the\ndepartment told the Associated Press that it had \"not reviewed or approved the\nballot’s language\".[106]\n\nFormer Governor [Aníbal Acevedo Vilá](/wiki/An%C3%ADbal_Acevedo_Vil%C3%A1\n\"Aníbal Acevedo Vilá\") (2005–2009) is convinced that statehood is not the\nsolution for either the U.S. or for Puerto Rico \"for economic, identity and\ncultural reasons\". He pointed out that voter turnout for the 2017 referendum\nwas extremely low, and suggests that a different type of mutually-beneficial\nrelationship should be found.[107]\n\nIf the federal government agrees to discuss an association agreement, the\nconditions would be negotiated between the two entities.[108] The agreement\nmight cover topics such as the role of the U.S. military in Puerto Rico, the\nuse of the U.S. currency, free trade between the two entities, and whether\n[Puerto Ricans](/wiki/Puerto_Ricans \"Puerto Ricans\") would be U.S.\ncitizens.[109]\n\nThe three current Free Associated States ([Marshall\nIslands](/wiki/Marshall_Islands \"Marshall Islands\"),\n[Micronesia](/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia \"Federated States of\nMicronesia\") and [Palau](/wiki/Palau \"Palau\")) use the American dollar,\nreceive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they\nrefuse military access to any other country. Their citizens are allowed to\nwork in the U.S. and serve in its military.[108]\n\nGovernor [Ricardo Rosselló](/wiki/Ricardo_Rossell%C3%B3 \"Ricardo Rosselló\") is\nstrongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to \"solve\nour 500-year-old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option .... It’s a\ncivil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy,\" he\ntold the news media.[110] Benefits of statehood include an additional $10\nbillion per year in federal funds, the right to vote in presidential\nelections, higher Social Security and Medicare benefits, and a right for its\ngovernment agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy. The latter is\ncurrently prohibited.[111]\n\nStatehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis,\nsince it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection. According to\nthe Government Development Bank, this might be the only solution to the debt\ncrisis. Congress has the power to vote to allow Chapter 9 protection without\nthe need for statehood, but in late 2015 there was very little support in the\nHouse for this concept. Other benefits to statehood include increased\ndisability benefits and Medicaid funding, the right to vote in Presidential\nelections and the higher (federal) minimum wage.[112]\n\nSubsequent to the 2017 referendum, Puerto Rico's legislators are also expected\nto vote on a bill that would allow the Governor to draft a state constitution\nand hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal\nCongress.[113][114] In spite of the outcome of the referendum, and the so-\ncalled Tennessee Plan (above), action by the [United States\nCongress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") would be\nnecessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the\n[Territorial Clause of the United States\nConstitution](/wiki/Article_Four_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Federal_property_and_the_Territorial_Clause\n\"Article Four of the United States Constitution\").[111]\n\n### United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization\n\nSince 1953, the [UN](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\") has been\nconsidering the [political status of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Political_status_of_Puerto_Rico \"Political status of Puerto Rico\")\nand how to assist it in achieving \"independence\" or \"decolonization\". In 1978,\nthe Special Committee determined that a \"colonial relationship\" existed\nbetween the U.S. and Puerto Rico.[115]\n\nThe UN's [Special Committee on\nDecolonization](/wiki/Special_Committee_on_Decolonization \"Special Committee\non Decolonization\") has often referred to Puerto Rico as a \"nation\" in its\nreports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often\nconsidered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national\nidentity.[116][117][118] Most recently, in a June 2016 report, the Special\nCommittee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-\ndetermination in Puerto Rico. More specifically, the group called on the\nUnited States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico\nto exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence. ...\nallow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to\naddress their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment,\nmarginalization, insolvency and poverty\".[119]\n\n#### International status\n\nOn November 27, 1953, shortly after the establishment of the Commonwealth, the\nGeneral Assembly of the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United\nNations\") approved [Resolution 748](/wiki/UN_General_Assembly_Resolution \"UN\nGeneral Assembly Resolution\"), removing Puerto Rico's classification as a\n[non-self-governing territory](/wiki/United_Nations_list_of_Non-Self-\nGoverning_Territories \"United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing\nTerritories\"). The General Assembly did not apply the full list of criteria\nwhich was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of\ntransmission of information regarding the non-self-governing status of Puerto\nRico.[120][121]\n\nAccording to the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico's Political Status in\nits December 21, 2007 report, the U.S., in its written submission to the UN in\n1953, never represented that Congress could not change its relationship with\nPuerto Rico without the territory's consent.[122] It stated that the U.S.\nJustice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto\nRico pursuant to the Territorial Clause[123] of the U.S. Constitution.[122]\n\nIn 1993 the [United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit \"United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\") stated that Congress may\nunilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal\nRelations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its\nchoice.[124] In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill, the\n[U.S. House Committee on\nResources](/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Natural_Resources \"United\nStates House Committee on Natural Resources\") stated, \"Puerto Rico's current\nstatus does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-\ngovernment under Resolution 1541\" (the three established forms of full self-\ngovernment being stated in the report as (1) national independence, (2) free\nassociation based on separate sovereignty, or (3) full integration with\nanother nation on the basis of equality). The report concluded that Puerto\nRico \"... remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of\n'free association' with the United States as that status is defined under\nUnited States law or international practice\", that the establishment of local\nself-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by\nthe U.S. Congress, and that U.S. Congress can also withdraw the U.S.\ncitizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time, for a\nlegitimate Federal purpose.[125][126] The application of the U.S. Constitution\nto Puerto Rico is limited by the [Insular Cases](/wiki/Insular_Cases \"Insular\nCases\").\n\nIn 2006,[127] 2007,[128] 2009,[129] 2010,[130] and 2011[131] the United\nNations [Special Committee on\nDecolonization](/wiki/Special_Committee_on_Decolonization \"Special Committee\non Decolonization\") passed resolutions calling on the United States to\nexpedite a process \"that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their\ninalienable right to self-determination and independence\",[132] and to release\nall Puerto Rican political prisoners in U.S. prisons, to clean up,\ndecontaminate and return the lands in the islands of Vieques and Culebra to\nthe people of Puerto Rico, to perform a probe into U.S. human rights\nviolations on the island and a probe into the killing by the FBI of pro-\nindependence leader [Filiberto Ojeda Rios](/wiki/Filiberto_Ojeda_Rios\n\"Filiberto Ojeda Rios\").\n\n  \n\n### 21st century\n\nFurther information: [Proposed political status for Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Proposed_political_status_for_Puerto_Rico \"Proposed political\nstatus for Puerto Rico\"); [Puerto Rican status referendum,\n2012](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2012 \"Puerto Rican status\nreferendum, 2012\"); and [President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's\nStatus](/wiki/President%27s_Task_Force_on_Puerto_Rico%27s_Status \"President's\nTask Force on Puerto Rico's Status\")\n\nPuerto Rican status referendum, 2012  \n---  \nLocation|  Puerto Rico  \nDate|  November 6, 2012; 5 years ago (2012-11-06)  \nVoting system|  [simple majority](/wiki/Majority \"Majority\") for the first\nquestion  \n[first-past-the-post](/wiki/First-past-the-post \"First-past-the-post\") for the\nsecond question  \nShould Puerto Rico continue its current territorial status?  \n|  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---  \nYes |  | 46.00%  \nNo |  | 54.00%  \n  \nWhich non-territorial option do you prefer?  \n|  |  |  |  |  |   \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[Statehood](/wiki/Statehood_movement_in_Puerto_Rico \"Statehood movement in Puerto Rico\") |  | 61.16%  \n[Sovereign Free Associated State](/wiki/Free_association_movement_in_Puerto_Rico \"Free association movement in Puerto Rico\") |  | 33.34%  \n[Independence](/wiki/Independence_movement_in_Puerto_Rico \"Independence movement in Puerto Rico\") |  | 5.49%  \nThere were 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots counted alongside the\n1,363,854 ballots which indicated a choice for one of the non-territorial\nalternatives. Under Puerto Rico Law, these ballots are not considered cast\nvotes and are therefore not reflected in the final tally.[133]  \n  \nOn July 15, 2009, the [United Nations Special Committee on\nDecolonization](/wiki/Special_Committee_on_Decolonization \"Special Committee\non Decolonization\") approved a draft resolution calling on the Government of\nthe United States to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican\npeople to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and\nindependence.[134]\n\nOn April 29, 2010, the U.S. House voted 223–169 to approve a measure for a\nfederally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, allowing\nPuerto Rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of\ncommonwealth, or to have a different political status. If Puerto Ricans voted\nto continue as a commonwealth, the Government of Puerto Rico was authorized to\nconduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date\non which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified; if Puerto Ricans\nvoted to have a different political status, a second referendum would\ndetermine whether Puerto Rico would become a U.S. state, an independent\ncountry, or a sovereign nation associated with the U.S. that would not be\nsubject to the [Territorial Clause](/wiki/Territorial_Clause \"Territorial\nClause\") of the United States Constitution.[135] During the House debate, a\nfourth option, to retain its present form of commonwealth (sometimes referred\nto as \"the [status quo](/wiki/Status_quo \"Status quo\")\") political status, was\nadded as an option in the second plebiscite.[135][136]\n\nImmediately following [U.S.\nHouse](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States House of\nRepresentatives\") passage, H.R. 2499 was sent to the [U.S.\nSenate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\"), where it was given\ntwo formal readings and referred to the [Senate Committee on Energy and\nNatural\nResources](/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Energy_and_Natural_Resources\n\"United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\"). On December\n22, 2010, the 111th United States Congress adjourned without any Senate vote\non H.R.2499, killing the bill.[137]\n\nThe latest Task Force report was released on March 11, 2011. The report\nsuggested a two-plebiscite process, including a \"first plebiscite that\nrequires the people of Puerto Rico to choose whether they wish to be part of\nthe United States (either via Statehood or Commonwealth) or wish to be\nindependent (via Independence or Free Association). If continuing to be part\nof the United States were chosen in the first plebiscite, a second vote would\nbe taken between Statehood and Commonwealth.\"[138]\n\nOn June 14, 2011, President [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\")\n\"promised to support 'a clear decision' by the people of Puerto Rico on\nstatehood\".[139] That same month, the United Nations Special Committee on\nDecolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by\nCuba's delegate on June 20, 2011, calling on the United States to expedite a\nprocess \"that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable\nright to self-determination and independence\".[132]\n\nOn November 6, 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with\nthe general elections.[140][140][141] The first question asked voters whether\nthey wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the\nU.S. Constitution. The second question posed three alternate status options if\nthe first question was approved: statehood, independence or [free\nassociation](/wiki/Compact_of_Free_Association \"Compact of Free\nAssociation\").[142] For the first question, 54 percent voted against the\ncurrent Commonwealth status. For the second question, 61.16% voted for\nstatehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free associated state, and 5.49% for\nindependence.[143]\n\nThere were also 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots, which are not reflected\nin the final tally, as they are not considered cast votes under Puerto Rico\nlaw.[133] On December 11, 2012, Puerto Rico's Legislature passed a concurrent\nresolution to request to the President and the U.S. Congress action on\nNovember 6, 2012 plebiscite results.[144] But on April 10, 2013, with the\nissue still being widely debated, the White House announced that it will seek\n$2.5 million to hold another referendum, this next one being the first Puerto\nRican status referendum to be financed by the [U.S. Federal\ngovernment](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal government\nof the United States\").[145]\n\nIn December 2015, the U.S. Government submitted a brief as [Amicus\nCuriae](/wiki/Amicus_Curiae \"Amicus Curiae\") to the [U.S. Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court \"U.S. Supreme Court\") related to the case\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle. The U.S. Government official\nposition is that the U.S. Constitution does not contemplate \"sovereign\nterritories\". That the Court has consistently recognized that \"there is no\nsovereignty in a Territory of the United States but that of the United States\nitself\". and a U.S. territory has \"no independent sovereignty comparable to\nthat of a state. That is because \"the Government of a territory owes its\nexistence wholly to the United States\". Congress's plenary authority over\nfederal territories includes the authority to permit self-government, whereby\nlocal officials administer a territory's internal affairs.[146]\n\nOn June 9, 2016, in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico vs Sanchez Valle, a 6–2\nmajority of the [Supreme Court of the United\nStates](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United\nStates\") determined that Puerto Rico is a territory and lacks\nSovereignty.[146]\n\nOn June 30, 2016, the [President of the United States of\nAmerica](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States_of_America \"President of the\nUnited States of America\") signed a new law approved by [U.S.\nCongress](/wiki/U.S._Congress \"U.S. Congress\"), H.R. 5278: PROMESA,\nestablishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rico Government. This board will\nhave a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and\noperations. In particular, the authority to establish the control board\nderives from the federal government's constitutional power to \"make all\nneedful rules and regulations\" regarding U.S. territories; The President would\nappoint all seven voting members of the board; and the board would have broad\nsovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico's\nlegislature, governor, and other public authorities.[147]\n\n### Political status\n\nThe latest referendum on statehood, independence, or an associated republic\nwas held on November 6, 2012. The people of Puerto Rico made history by\nrequesting, for the first time ever, the conclusion of the island's current\nterritorial status. Almost 78% of registered voters participated in a\nplebiscite held to resolve Puerto Rico's status, and a slim but clear majority\n(54%) disagreed with Puerto Rico maintaining its present territorial status.\nFurthermore, among the possible alternatives, sixty-one percent (61%) of\nvoters chose the statehood option, while one third of the ballots were\nsubmitted blank.[148][149]\n\nOn December 11, 2012, the [Legislative Assembly of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Puerto_Rico \"Legislative Assembly of\nPuerto Rico\") enacted a [concurrent resolution](/wiki/Concurrent_resolution\n\"Concurrent resolution\") requesting the\n[President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\") and the [Congress of the United\nStates](/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States \"Congress of the United States\")\nto respond to the referendum of the people of Puerto Rico, held on November 6,\n2012, to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process\nto admit Puerto Rico as a State.[108] The initiative has not made Puerto Rico\ninto a state.\n\n### Hurricane Maria\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Buildings_damaged_%2823538370818%29.jpg/300px-\nBuildings_damaged_%2823538370818%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Buildings_damaged_\\(23538370818\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Buildings_damaged_\\(23538370818\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA neighborhood in Puerto Rico heavily damaged by the storm.\n\nIn late September 2017, [Hurricane Maria](/wiki/Hurricane_Maria \"Hurricane\nMaria\") hit the island as a Category 4 storm causing severe damage to homes,\nother buildings and infrastructure. The recovery as of late November was slow\nbut progress had been made. Electricity was restored to two-thirds of the\nisland, although there was some doubt as to the number of residents getting\nreliable power.[150] In January 2018, it was reported that close to 40 percent\nof the island's customers still did not have electricity.[151] The vast\nmajority had access to water but were still required to boil it. The number\nstill living in shelters had dropped to 982 with thousands of others living\nwith relatives.[152] The official death toll at the time was 58 but some\nsources indicated that the actual number is much higher.[150] A dam on the\nisland was close to failure and officials were concerned about additional\nflooding from this source.[153]\n\nThousands had left Puerto Rico, with close to 200,000 having arrived in\nFlorida alone.[35] Those who were then living on the mainland experienced\ndifficulty in getting health care benefits.[154][155] A _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ report on November 27\nsaid it was understandable that Puerto Ricans wanted to leave the island.\n\"Basic essentials are hard to find and electricity and other utilities are\nunreliable or entirely inaccessible. Much of the population has been unable to\nreturn to jobs or to school and access to health care has been severely\nlimited.\" The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at New York's [Hunter\nCollege](/wiki/Hunter_College \"Hunter College\") estimated that some half\nmillion people, about 14% of the population, may permanently leave by\n2019.[156]\n\nThe total damage on the island was estimated as up to $95 billion.[157] By the\nend of November, FEMA had received over a million applications for aid and had\napproved about a quarter of those. The US government had agreed in October to\nprovide funding to rebuild and up to $4.9 billion in loans to help the\nisland's government. FEMA had $464 million earmarked to help local governments\nrebuild public buildings and infrastructure. Bills for other funding were\nbeing considered in Washington but little progress had been made on those.[35]\n\nA November 28, 2017 report by the [Sierra Club](/wiki/Sierra_Club \"Sierra\nClub\") included this comment: \"It will take years to rebuild Puerto Rico, not\njust from the worst hurricane to make landfall since 1932, but to sustainably\novercome environmental injustices which made Maria's devastation even more\ncatastrophic\".[153]\n\nIn May, 2017, the [Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil](/wiki/Natural_Resources_Defense_Council \"Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil\") reported that Puerto Rico's water system was the worst as measured\nby the [Clean Water Act](/wiki/Clean_Water_Act \"Clean Water Act\"). 70% of the\npopulation drank water that violated U.S. law.[158]\n\n#### Rebuilding efforts\n\nA tourism web site report in March 2018 indicated that all airports were\noperating, although Luis Munoz Marin Airport would not be back to handling the\nfull number of flights until July 2018. Some 90% of the island was receiving\nelectricity, although the power structure would require another $17.6 billion\nfor full rebuilding, according to the [United States Department of\nEnergy](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy \"United States Department of\nEnergy\").[159] Nearly all residents had access to telecommunications service\nand running water. All hospitals were operating. Some 83% of hotel rooms were\navailable for use and the cruise ship port was receiving ships; 58 arrived in\nSan Juan in February. The island was encouraging operators to increase the\nnumber of tourists.[160]\n\nReports in April 2018 stated that Puerto Rico will receive $18.5 billion from\nthe [United States Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development\n\"United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\") to help rebuild\nhomes and infrastructure. This was substantially less than the $46 billion\nrequested by the governor. However, the island was expecting to receive\napproximately $50 billion for disaster relief over the subsequent six years\nmostly via the [Federal Emergency Management\nAgency](/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency \"Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency\").[161] At that time, nearly 2800 families were living in\nFEMA-sponsored short-term housing across 34 states and Puerto Rico. Nearly\nhalf of the schools are operating at only 60% classroom capacity. Over 280\npublic schools would not reopen in the fall; 827 were expected to be\noperational. Almost 40,000 students left the island's schools since May 2017;\nsome of these were in schools in the mainland U.S. (Before the hurricanes,\nPuerto Rico had planned to close 179 schools due to inadequate numbers of\nstudents.)[159]\n\n#### Death toll\n\nThe official number of Hurricane Maria-related deaths as reported by the\ngovernment of Puerto Rico is 64. The Commonwealth has commissioned [George\nWashington University](/wiki/George_Washington_University \"George Washington\nUniversity\") to assess the death toll and is awaiting that report.[162] An\nacademic study based on household surveys and reported in the [New England\nJournal of Medicine](/wiki/New_England_Journal_of_Medicine \"New England\nJournal of Medicine\") estimated that the number of hurricane-related deaths\nduring the period September 20, 2017 to December 31, 2017 was around 4,600\n(range 793-8,498)[163]\n\n## Geography\n\nMain articles: [Geography of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Geography_of_Puerto_Rico\n\"Geography of Puerto Rico\") and [Geology of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Geology_of_Puerto_Rico \"Geology of Puerto Rico\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Rico_%281%29.png/550px-\nRico_%281%29.png)](/wiki/File:Rico_\\(1\\).png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rico_\\(1\\).png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA map of Puerto Rico\n\nPuerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller\nislands, including [Vieques](/wiki/Vieques,_Puerto_Rico \"Vieques, Puerto\nRico\"), [Culebra](/wiki/Culebra,_Puerto_Rico \"Culebra, Puerto Rico\"),\n[Mona](/wiki/Mona,_Puerto_Rico \"Mona, Puerto Rico\"),\n[Desecheo](/wiki/Desecheo_Island \"Desecheo Island\"), and [Caja de\nMuertos](/wiki/Caja_de_Muertos,_Puerto_Rico \"Caja de Muertos, Puerto Rico\").\nOf these five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round.

The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for\nthe general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and\neventually to the rise of the [Puerto Rican Nationalist\nParty](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party \"Puerto Rican Nationalist Party\").\n\nThe [Puerto Rico Trench](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Trench \"Puerto Rico Trench\"), the\nlargest and deepest trench in the Atlantic, is located about 115 km (71 mi)\nnorth of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American\nplates.[176] It is 280 km (170 mi) long.[177] At its deepest point, named the\n[Milwaukee Deep](/wiki/Milwaukee_Deep \"Milwaukee Deep\"), it is almost 8,400 m\n(27,600 ft) deep.[176]\n\n### Climate\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/STS034-76-88.jpg/220px-\nSTS034-76-88.jpg)](/wiki/File:STS034-76-88.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:STS034-76-88.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPuerto Rico seen from [space](/wiki/Space \"Space\") ([STS-34](/wiki/STS-34\n\"STS-34\") mission)\n\nMain article: [Climate of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Climate_of_Puerto_Rico \"Climate\nof Puerto Rico\")\n\nThe climate of Puerto Rico in the Köppen climate classification is [tropical\nrainforest](/wiki/Tropical_rainforest \"Tropical rainforest\"). Temperatures are\nwarm to hot year round, averaging near 85 °F (29 °C) in lower elevations and\n70 °F (21 °C) in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island\nyear round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season which stretches from April into\nNovember. The mountains of the Cordillera Central are the main cause of the\nvariations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short\ndistances. The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and\ndirection due to their sheltering and channeling effects adding to the\nclimatic variation.\n\nThe island has an average temperature of 82.4 °F (28 °C) throughout the year,\nwith an average minimum temperature of 66.9 °F (19 °C) and maximum of 85.4 °F\n(30 °C). Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands\nand coastal areas. The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees\nhigher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are\nalways cooler than those on the rest of the island.\n\nBetween the dry and wet season, there is a temperature change of around 6 °F\n(3.3 °C). This is mainly due to the warm waters of the tropical [Atlantic\nOcean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic Ocean\"), which significantly modify\ncooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal waters temperatures\naround the years are about 75 °F (24 °C) in February to 85 °F (29 °C) in\nAugust. The highest temperature ever recorded was 99 °F (37 °C) at\n[Arecibo](/wiki/Arecibo,_Puerto_Rico \"Arecibo, Puerto Rico\"),[178] while the\nlowest temperature ever recorded was 40 °F (4 °C) in the mountains at\n[Adjuntas](/wiki/Adjuntas,_Puerto_Rico \"Adjuntas, Puerto Rico\"),\n[Aibonito](/wiki/Aibonito,_Puerto_Rico \"Aibonito, Puerto Rico\"), and\n[Corozal](/wiki/Corozal,_Puerto_Rico \"Corozal, Puerto Rico\").[179] The average\nyearly precipitation is 1,687 mm (66 in).[180]\n\nhideClimate data for [San Juan](/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico \"San Juan, Puerto\nRico\")  \n---  \nMonth  | Jan  | Feb  | Mar  | Apr  | May  | Jun  | Jul  | Aug  | Sep  | Oct  | Nov  | Dec  | Year   \nAverage high °C (°F)  | 28  \n(83)  | 29  \n(84)  | 29  \n(85)  | 30  \n(86)  | 31  \n(88)  | 32  \n(89)  | 32  \n(89)  | 32  \n(89)  | 32  \n(89)  | 32  \n(89)  | 30  \n(86)  | 29  \n(84)  | 31  \n(87)  \nAverage low °C (°F)  | 22  \n(72)  | 22  \n(72)  | 23  \n(73)  | 23  \n(74)  | 24  \n(76)  | 26  \n(78)  | 26  \n(78)  | 26  \n(78)  | 26  \n(78)  | 25  \n(77)  | 24  \n(75)  | 23  \n(73)  | 24  \n(75)  \nAverage rainfall mm (inches)  | 95.5  \n(3.76)  | 62.7  \n(2.47)  | 49.5  \n(1.95)  | 118.9  \n(4.68)  | 149.9  \n(5.90)  | 112  \n(4.41)  | 128.8  \n(5.07)  | 138.7  \n(5.46)  | 146.6  \n(5.77)  | 142  \n(5.59)  | 161.3  \n(6.35)  | 127.5  \n(5.02)  | 1,433.4  \n(56.43)  \nAverage rainy days  | 17  | 13  | 12  | 13  | 17  | 15  | 19  | 18  | 17  | 17  | 18  | 19  | 196   \nAverage [relative humidity](/wiki/Relative_humidity \"Relative humidity\") (%)  | 78.0  | 75.5  | 73.9  | 75.0  | 77.2  | 77.0  | 78.0  | 77.6  | 77.7  | 78.2  | 78.6  | 78.3  | 77.1   \nMean daily [sunshine hours](/wiki/Sunshine_duration \"Sunshine duration\") | 8  | 8  | 9  | 9  | 8  | 9  | 9  | 9  | 9  | 9  | 8  | 8  | 8.6   \nSource: [\"Average Weather for San Juan,\nPR\"](http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USPR0087).\n[The Weather Channel](/wiki/The_Weather_Channel \"The Weather Channel\").\nRetrieved March 22, 2014.  \n  \nPuerto Rico experiences the [Atlantic hurricane\nseason](/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane_season \"Atlantic hurricane season\"), similar\nto the remainder of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic oceans. On average, a\nquarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones, which\nare more prevalent during periods of La Niña than [El Niño](/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o\n\"El Niño\").[181] A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico,\non average, every five years. A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the\nisland, on average, every seven years. Since 1851, the [Lake Okeechobee\nHurricane](/wiki/1928_Okeechobee_Hurricane \"1928 Okeechobee Hurricane\") of\nSeptember 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5\nhurricane.[182]\n\nIn the busy [2017 Atlantic hurricane\nseason](/wiki/2017_Atlantic_hurricane_season \"2017 Atlantic hurricane\nseason\"), Puerto Rico avoided a direct hit by the Category 5 [Hurricane\nIrma](/wiki/Hurricane_Irma \"Hurricane Irma\") on September 8, 2017, but high\nwinds caused a loss of electrical power to some one million residents. Almost\n50% of hospitals were operating with power provided by generators.[183] The\nCategory 4 [Hurricane Jose](/wiki/Hurricane_Jose_\\(2017\\) \"Hurricane Jose\n\\(2017\\)\"), as expected, veered away from Puerto Rico.[184] A short time\nlater, the devastating [Hurricane Maria](/wiki/Hurricane_Maria \"Hurricane\nMaria\") made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane, with sustained\n155 mph (249 km/h) winds, powerful rains and widespread flooding causing\ntremendous destruction, including the electrical grid, which could remain out\nfor 4–6 months.[185][186][187] With such widespread destruction and a great\nneed for supplies – everything from drinking water, food, medicine and\npersonal care items to fuel for generators and construction materials for\nrebuilding the island – Gov. Rossello and several Congressmen called on the\nfederal government to waive the WWI-era Jones Act (protectionist provisions:\nships made and owned in U.S., and with U.S. crews), which essentially double\nPuerto Rico's cost for shipped goods relative to neighboring islands. On\nSeptember 28, U.S. President [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\")\nwaived the Act for ten days.[188]\n\n### Biodiversity\n\nMain articles: [Fauna of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Fauna_of_Puerto_Rico \"Fauna of\nPuerto Rico\") and [Flora of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Flora_of_Puerto_Rico \"Flora of\nPuerto Rico\")\n\n[![\"In this image there is a brown coquí.

Starting soon after [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II\n\"World War II\"), poverty, cheap airfares, and promotion by the island\ngovernment caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the United States,\nparticularly to the [Northeastern states](/wiki/Northeastern_United_States\n\"Northeastern United States\"), and [Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\").[215]\nThis trend continued even as Puerto Rico's economy improved and its birth rate\ndeclined. Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of \"[circular\nmigration](/wiki/Circular_migration \"Circular migration\")\", with some migrants\nreturning to the island. In recent years, the population has declined\nmarkedly, falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% (36,000 people) in\n2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration.[216]\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the number of Puerto Ricans living in the United\nStates outside of Puerto Rico far exceeds those living in Puerto Rico.\nEmigration exceeds immigration. As those who leave tend to be better educated\nthan those that remain, this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico’s economy.\n\nBased on the July 1, 2016 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population\nof the Commonwealth had declined by 314,482 people since the 2010 Census data\nhad been tabulated.[195]\n\n### Population distribution\n\nThe most populous city is the capital, [San Juan](/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico\n\"San Juan, Puerto Rico\"), with approximately 371,400 people based on a 2015\nestimate by the Census Bureau.[217] Other major cities include\n[Bayamón](/wiki/Bayam%C3%B3n,_Puerto_Rico \"Bayamón, Puerto Rico\"),\n[Carolina](/wiki/Carolina,_Puerto_Rico \"Carolina, Puerto Rico\"),\n[Ponce](/wiki/Ponce,_Puerto_Rico \"Ponce, Puerto Rico\"), and\n[Caguas](/wiki/Caguas,_Puerto_Rico \"Caguas, Puerto Rico\").

Spanish is, and has been,\nthe only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system,\ndespite a 1902 English-only language law.[221] However, all official business\nof the [U.S. District Court](/wiki/U.S._District_Court \"U.S. District Court\")\nfor the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the\nprimary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant\nlanguage of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly\n95% of the population.[222]\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 update provides the following facts:[2] 94.1% of\nadults speak Spanish, 5.8% speak only English, 78.3% do not speak English\n\"very well\".\n\nIn Puerto Rico, public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in\nSpanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400\npublic schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections\nfrom teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully\nfluent in English.[223] English is taught as a second language and is a\ncompulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the\ndeaf community are [American Sign Language](/wiki/American_Sign_Language\n\"American Sign Language\") and its local variant, [Puerto Rican Sign\nLanguage](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Sign_Language \"Puerto Rican Sign Language\").\n\nThe Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in\nvocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere.\nAs a product of Puerto Rican history, the island possesses a unique Spanish\ndialect. Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many [Taíno](/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_language\n\"Taíno language\") words, as well as English words. The largest influence on\nthe Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands. Taíno\n[loanwords](/wiki/Loanword \"Loanword\") are most often used in the context of\nvegetation, natural phenomena, and native musical instruments. Similarly,\nwords attributed to primarily West [African languages](/wiki/African_languages\n\"African languages\") were adopted in the contexts of foods, music, and dances,\nparticularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-\nSaharan Africans.[224]\n\n### Religion\n\nReligious affiliation in Puerto Rico (2014)[225][226]\n\n[Roman Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholic \"Roman Catholic\") (56%)\n\n[Protestant](/wiki/Protestant \"Protestant\") (33%)\n\nOther (3%)\n\n[Irreligious](/wiki/Irreligious \"Irreligious\") (8%)\n\nThe [Roman Catholic Church](/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Puerto_Rico \"Roman\nCatholicism in Puerto Rico\") was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually\nbecame the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. The first\n[dioceses](/wiki/Dioceses \"Dioceses\") in the Americas, including that of\nPuerto Rico, were authorized by [Pope Julius II](/wiki/Pope_Julius_II \"Pope\nJulius II\") in 1511.[227] One Pope, [John Paul II](/wiki/John_Paul_II \"John\nPaul II\"), visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All\n[municipalities](/wiki/Municipalities_of_Puerto_Rico \"Municipalities of Puerto\nRico\") in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are\nlocated at the town center, or plaza. African slaves brought and maintained\nvarious ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples;\nin particular, the [Yoruba](/wiki/Yoruba_religion \"Yoruba religion\") beliefs\nof [Santería](/wiki/Santer%C3%ADa \"Santería\") and/or [Ifá](/wiki/If%C3%A1\n\"Ifá\"), and the [Kongo](/wiki/Kongo_people \"Kongo people\")-derived [Palo\nMayombe](/wiki/Palo_Mayombe \"Palo Mayombe\"). Some aspects were absorbed into\nsyncretic Christianity.\n\n[Protestantism](/wiki/Protestantism_in_Puerto_Rico \"Protestantism in Puerto\nRico\"), which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, has slightly\nreemerged under United States rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more\ninterconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues\nto be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, [Iglesia de la\nSantísima Trinidad](/wiki/Iglesia_de_la_Sant%C3%ADsima_Trinidad \"Iglesia de la\nSantísima Trinidad\"), was established in Ponce by the\n[Anglican](/wiki/Anglican \"Anglican\") [Diocese of\nAntigua](/wiki/Diocese_of_Antigua \"Diocese of Antigua\") in 1872.[228] It was\nthe first non-Roman Catholic Church in the entire [Spanish\nEmpire](/wiki/Spanish_Empire \"Spanish Empire\") in [the\nAmericas](/wiki/The_Americas \"The Americas\").[229][230]\n\nPollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38% Roman\nCatholic, 28% Pentecostal, and 18% were members of independent churches, which\nwould give a Protestant percentage of 46% if the last two populations are\ncombined. Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people.\nAnother researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of\nProtestants:\n\n> Puerto Rico, by virtue of its long political association with the United\n> States, is the most Protestant of Latin American countries, with a\n> Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of\n> whom are [Pentecostal](/wiki/Pentecostal \"Pentecostal\"). David Stoll\n> calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches\n> from 1960–1985 for another twenty-five years Puerto Rico will become 75\n> percent evangelical. (Ana Adams: \"Brincando el Charco...\" in _Power,\n> Politics and Pentecostals in Latin America_ , Edward Cleary, ed., 1997. p.\n> 164).[231]\n\nThe data provided for 2014 by [Pew Research Center](/wiki/Pew_Research_Center\n\"Pew Research Center\"),[206] is summarized in the chart to the right. An\n[Associated Press](/wiki/Associated_Press \"Associated Press\") article in March\n2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as\nCatholic\" but provided no source for this information.[232]\n\nThe CIA World Factbook reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico\nidentifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other.\nNeither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be\nrecent.[233] A 2013 Pew Research survey found that only about 45% of Puerto\nRican adults identified themselves as Catholic, 29% as Protestant and 20% as\nunaffiliated with a religion. The people surveyed by Pew consisted of Puerto\nRicans living in the 50 states and DC and may not be indicative of those\nliving in the Commonwealth.[234]\n\nBy 2014, a Pew Research report, with the sub-title _Widespread Change in a\nHistorically Catholic Region_ , indicated that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were\nCatholic and that 33% were Protestant; this survey was completed between\nOctober 2013 and February 2014.[235]\n\nAn [Eastern Orthodox](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox \"Eastern Orthodox\") community,\nthe Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos / St. Spyridon's Church is located in\nTrujillo Alto, and serves the small Orthodox community. This affiliation\naccounted for under 1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research\nreport.[236] In 1940, [Juanita García Peraza](/wiki/Juanita_Garc%C3%ADa_Peraza\n\"Juanita García Peraza\") founded the [Mita\nCongregation](/wiki/Mita_Congregation \"Mita Congregation\"), the first religion\nof Puerto Rican origin.[237] [Taíno religious\npractices](/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_people \"Taíno people\") have been\nrediscovered/reinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates. Similarly, some\naspects of African religious traditions have been kept by some adherents. In\n1952, a handful of American Jews established the island's first\n[synagogue](/wiki/Synagogue \"Synagogue\"); this religion accounts for under 1%\nof the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report.[238][239] The\nsynagogue, called _Sha 'are Zedeck_, hired its first rabbi in 1954.[240]\nPuerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, numbering 3000\npeople (date not stated),[241] and is the only Caribbean island in which the\n[Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Jews \"Conservative Jews\"),\n[Reform](/wiki/Reform_Jews \"Reform Jews\") and [Orthodox\nJewish](/wiki/Orthodox_Jews \"Orthodox Jews\") movements all are\nrepresented.[240][242] In 2007, there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico,\nrepresenting about 0.13% of the population.[243][244] Eight\n[mosques](/wiki/Mosques \"Mosques\") are located throughout the island, with\nmost Muslims living in [Río Piedras](/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Piedras \"Río Piedras\") and\n[Caguas](/wiki/Caguas \"Caguas\"), most of these Muslims are of Palestinian and\nJordanian descent.[245][246] There is also a [Bahá'í](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD\n\"Bahá'í\") community on the island.[247] In 2015, the 25,832 [Jehovah's\nWitnesses](/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses \"Jehovah's Witnesses\") represented\nabout 0.70% of the population, with 324 congregations.[248] The [Padmasambhava\nBuddhist Center](/wiki/Chinese_immigration_to_Puerto_Rico \"Chinese immigration\nto Puerto Rico\"), whose followers practice [Tibetan\nBuddhism](/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism \"Tibetan Buddhism\"), as well as [Nichiren\nBuddhism](/wiki/Nichiren_Buddhism \"Nichiren Buddhism\") have branches in Puerto\nRico.[249] There are several atheist activist and educational organizations,\nand an atheistic parody religion called the [Pastafarian](/wiki/Pastafarian\n\"Pastafarian\") Church of Puerto Rico.[250]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/San_Juan_Cathedral.JPG/90px-San_Juan_Cathedral.JPG)](/wiki/File:San_Juan_Cathedral.JPG)\n\nRoman Catholic Cathedral of **San Juan Bautista**.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Iglesia_de_la_Santisima_Trinidad%2C_Barrio_Cuarto%2C_Ponce%2C_PR_%286728612217%29.jpg/120px-Iglesia_de_la_Santisima_Trinidad%2C_Barrio_Cuarto%2C_Ponce%2C_PR_%286728612217%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Iglesia_de_la_Santisima_Trinidad,_Barrio_Cuarto,_Ponce,_PR_\\(6728612217\\).jpg)\n\nAnglican Iglesia Santísima Trinidad in Ponce\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/IMG_3392_-_Centro_Islamico_de_Ponce%2C_PR.jpg/90px-IMG_3392_-_Centro_Islamico_de_Ponce%2C_PR.jpg)](/wiki/File:IMG_3392_-_Centro_Islamico_de_Ponce,_PR.jpg)\n\nIslamic Center at Ponce\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Shaare_Zedeck.jpg/120px-Shaare_Zedeck.jpg)](/wiki/File:Shaare_Zedeck.jpg)\n\nInside Sha'are Zedeck in San Juan\n\n## Government\n\nMain articles: [Government of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Government_of_Puerto_Rico\n\"Government of Puerto Rico\") and [Politics of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Politics_of_Puerto_Rico \"Politics of Puerto Rico\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Ricardo_Rossello.jpg/260px-\nRicardo_Rossello.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ricardo_Rossello.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ricardo_Rossello.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGovernor of Puerto Rico, [Ricardo Rosselló](/wiki/Ricardo_Rossell%C3%B3\n\"Ricardo Rosselló\")\n\nPuerto Rico has [8 senatorial\ndistricts](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_senatorial_districts \"Puerto Rico senatorial\ndistricts\"), [40 representative\ndistricts](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_representative_districts \"Puerto Rico\nrepresentative districts\") and [78\nmunicipalities](/wiki/Municipalities_of_Puerto_Rico \"Municipalities of Puerto\nRico\").

This difference is common as the\npolitical landscape experiences political cycles between both parties, with\nthe PPD ruling all branches of government for 36 of the past 64 years. The\nPNP, on the other hand, has ruled both the executive and legislative branch\nconcurrently for 16 years. The other 12 years experienced a [divided\ngovernment](/wiki/Divided_government_in_the_United_States \"Divided government\nin the United States\").\n\nSince 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the [Popular\nDemocratic Party](/wiki/Popular_Democratic_Party_of_Puerto_Rico \"Popular\nDemocratic Party of Puerto Rico\") (PPD in Spanish), the [New Progressive\nParty](/wiki/New_Progressive_Party_of_Puerto_Rico \"New Progressive Party of\nPuerto Rico\") (PNP in Spanish) and the [Puerto Rican Independence\nParty](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party \"Puerto Rican Independence\nParty\") (PIP). The three parties stand for different political status. The\nPPD, for example, seeks [to maintain the island's status with the U.S. as a\ncommonwealth](/wiki/Status_quo_movement_in_Puerto_Rico \"Status quo movement in\nPuerto Rico\"), while the PNP, on the other hand, seeks [to make Puerto Rico a\nstate of the United States](/wiki/Statehood_movement_in_Puerto_Rico \"Statehood\nmovement in Puerto Rico\"). The PIP, in contrast, seeks a complete separation\nfrom the United States by seeking [to make Puerto Rico a sovereign\nnation](/wiki/Independence_movement_in_Puerto_Rico \"Independence movement in\nPuerto Rico\"). In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about\n47% of the vote each while the PIP holds only about 5%.\n\nAfter 2007, other parties emerged on the island.

But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed\nto obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election. Four\nyears later, the 2012 election saw the emergence of the [Movimiento Unión\nSoberanista](/wiki/Movimiento_Uni%C3%B3n_Soberanista \"Movimiento Unión\nSoberanista\") (MUS; English: _Sovereign Union Movement_) and the [Partido del\nPueblo Trabajador](/wiki/Partido_del_Pueblo_Trabajador \"Partido del Pueblo\nTrabajador\") (PPT; English: _Working People 's Party_) but none obtained more\nthan 1% of the vote.\n\nOther non-registered parties include the [Puerto Rican Nationalist\nParty](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party \"Puerto Rican Nationalist Party\"),\nthe [Socialist Workers\nMovement](/wiki/Socialist_Workers_Movement_\\(Puerto_Rico\\) \"Socialist Workers\nMovement \\(Puerto Rico\\)\"), and the [Hostosian National Independence\nMovement](/wiki/Hostosian_National_Independence_Movement \"Hostosian National\nIndependence Movement\").\n\n### Law\n\nMain articles: [Constitution of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Constitution_of_Puerto_Rico\n\"Constitution of Puerto Rico\") and [Law of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Law_of_Puerto_Rico \"Law of Puerto Rico\")\n\nThe insular legal system is a blend of [civil\nlaw](/wiki/Civil_law_\\(legal_system\\) \"Civil law \\(legal system\\)\") and the\n[common law](/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") systems.\n\nPuerto Rico is the only current U.S. possession whose legal system operates\nprimarily in a language other than American English: namely,\n[Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_language \"Spanish language\"). Because the [U.S.\nfederal government](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal\ngovernment of the United States\") operates primarily in English, all Puerto\nRican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in [U.S.\nfederal courts](/wiki/United_States_federal_courts \"United States federal\ncourts\"), and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.\n\n[Title 48 of the United States Code](/wiki/Title_48_of_the_United_States_Code\n\"Title 48 of the United States Code\") outlines the role of the United States\nCode to United States territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico. After\nthe U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901, it initiated legal\nreforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law, criminal\nprocedure, and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\"). Although Puerto Rico has since\nfollowed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from\nstatutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary, several portions of its\ncriminal law still reflect the influence of the [California Penal\nCode](/wiki/California_Penal_Code \"California Penal Code\").\n\nThe judicial branch is headed by the [Chief Justice](/wiki/Chief_Justice\n\"Chief Justice\") of the [Puerto Rico Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Supreme_Court \"Puerto Rico Supreme Court\"), which is\nthe only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are\ncreated by the [Legislative Assembly of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Puerto_Rico \"Legislative Assembly of\nPuerto Rico\"). There is also a [Federal District Court for Puerto\nRico](/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Puerto_Rico\n\"United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\"). Someone\naccused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same\nact in a Commonwealth court, unlike a state court, since Puerto Rico as a\nterritory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does.[260] Such\na parallel accusation would constitute [double jeopardy](/wiki/Double_jeopardy\n\"Double jeopardy\").\n\n### Political status\n\nMain articles: [Political status of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Political_status_of_Puerto_Rico \"Political status of Puerto Rico\")\nand [Proposed political status for Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Proposed_political_status_for_Puerto_Rico \"Proposed political\nstatus for Puerto Rico\")\n\nThe nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. is the\nsubject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the [United States\nCongress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\"), and the\n[United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\").[261] Specifically,\nthe basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain a [U.S.\nterritory](/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States \"Territories of the United\nStates\"), become a [U.S. state](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S. state\"), or become an\nindependent country.[262]\n\n#### Within the United States\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/PR_Capitol%2C_south_side.JPG/300px-\nPR_Capitol%2C_south_side.JPG)](/wiki/File:PR_Capitol,_south_side.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PR_Capitol,_south_side.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Capitol of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Capitol_of_Puerto_Rico \"Capitol of Puerto\nRico\"), home of the Legislative Assembly in Puerto Rico\n\nConstitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the [plenary\npowers](/wiki/Plenary_powers \"Plenary powers\") of the [United States\nCongress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") under the\n[territorial clause](/wiki/Territorial_clause \"Territorial clause\") of\n[Article IV of the U.S.\nConstitution](/wiki/Article_Four_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article\nFour of the United States Constitution\").[263] [Laws enacted at the federal\nlevel in the United States](/wiki/U.S._federal_law \"U.S. federal law\") apply\nto Puerto Rico as well, regardless of its political status. Their residents\n[do not have voting representation in the U.S.\nCongress](/wiki/Federal_voting_rights_in_Puerto_Rico \"Federal voting rights in\nPuerto Rico\"). Like the different states of the United States, Puerto Rico\nlacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation\", for example, the power\nto manage its \"external relations with other nations\", which is held by the\nU.S. federal government. The Supreme Court of the United States has indicated\nthat once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or\nthe courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches\nmay switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which\nthey, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".[264]\n\nPuerto Ricans \"were collectively made [U.S.\ncitizens](/wiki/U.S._citizenship#Birthright_citizenship \"U.S. citizenship\")\"\nin 1917 as a result of the [Jones-Shafroth Act](/wiki/Jones-Shafroth_Act\n\"Jones-Shafroth Act\").[265] U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote\nfor the U.S. president, though both major parties, Republican and Democratic,\nrun primary elections in Puerto Rico to send delegates to vote on a\npresidential candidate. Since Puerto Rico is an [unincorporated\nterritory](/wiki/Unincorporated_territories_of_the_United_States\n\"Unincorporated territories of the United States\") (see above) and not a U.S.\nstate, the [United States Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution\n\"United States Constitution\") does not fully [enfranchise](/wiki/Enfranchise\n\"Enfranchise\") [U.S. citizens](/wiki/U.S._citizen \"U.S. citizen\") residing in\nPuerto Rico.[253][266]\n\nOnly [fundamental rights](/wiki/Fundamental_right \"Fundamental right\") under\nthe American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto\nRicans. Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights\napply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history\nof service in the U.S. Armed Forces and, since 1917, they have been included\nin the U.S. [compulsory draft](/wiki/Compulsory_draft \"Compulsory draft\")\nwhensoever it has been in effect.\n\nThough the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, Puerto Ricans are\nalso required to pay many kinds of U.S. federal taxes, not including the\nfederal personal income tax for Puerto Rico-sourced income, but only under\ncertain circumstances.[267][268][269][270][271][272][273][274] In 2009, Puerto\nRico paid $3.742 billion into the [U.S. Treasury](/wiki/U.S._Treasury \"U.S.\nTreasury\").[275] Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, and are\nthus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement. They are excluded\nfrom the [Supplemental Security Income](/wiki/Supplemental_Security_Income\n\"Supplemental Security Income\") (SSI), and the island actually receives a\nsmaller fraction of the [Medicaid](/wiki/Medicaid \"Medicaid\") funding it would\nreceive if it were a U.S. state.[276] Also, Medicare providers receive less-\nthan-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in\nPuerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system.[277]\n\nWhile a state may try an individual for the same crime he/she was tried in\nfederal court, this is not the case in Puerto Rico. Being a U.S. territory,\nPuerto Rico's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not\nfrom local sovereignty as with the states. Thus, such a parallel accusation\nwould constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.[260]\n\nIn 1992, President [George H. W. Bush](/wiki/George_H._W._Bush \"George H. W.\nBush\") issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies\nestablishing the current administrative relationship between the federal\ngovernment and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all\nfederal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico\nadministratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt\nfederal programs or operations.\n\nMany federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto\nRico, just as in any state, including the [Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation](/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation \"Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation\"), [Federal Emergency Management\nAgency](/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency \"Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency\"), [Transportation Security\nAdministration](/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration \"Transportation\nSecurity Administration\"), [Social Security\nAdministration](/wiki/Social_Security_Administration \"Social Security\nAdministration\"), and others. While Puerto Rico has its own [Commonwealth\njudicial system](/wiki/Judiciary_of_Puerto_Rico \"Judiciary of Puerto Rico\")\nsimilar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a U.S. federal district court\nin Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in\nother federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status\nat the time of their appointment.

This IRS section was critical to the economy, as it established\n[tax exemptions](/wiki/Tax_exemption \"Tax exemption\") for U.S. corporations\nthat settled in Puerto Rico, and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send\ntheir earnings to the parent corporation at any time, without paying federal\ntax on corporate income. Puerto Rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a\nrelatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a [purchasing\npower parity](/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity \"Purchasing power parity\") per\ncapita higher than 80% of the rest of the world.[292]\n\nAcademically, most of Puerto Rico's economic woes stem from federal\nregulations that expired, have been repealed, or no longer apply to Puerto\nRico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout\nhistory;[p] its highly politicized public policy which tends to change\n[whenever a political party gains\npower](/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_Puerto_Rico \"Political party strength\nin Puerto Rico\");[q] as well as [its highly inefficient local\ngovernment](/wiki/Government_of_Puerto_Rico \"Government of Puerto Rico\")[r][s]\nwhich has accrued a [public debt](/wiki/Public_debt_of_Puerto_Rico \"Public\ndebt of Puerto Rico\") equal to 68% of its [gross domestic\nproduct](/wiki/Gross_domestic_product \"Gross domestic product\") throughout\ntime.[t][u]\n\nIn comparison to [the different states of the United States](/wiki/U.S._state\n\"U.S. state\"), Puerto Rico is poorer than Mississippi (the poorest state of\nthe U.S.) with 41% of its population below the [poverty\nline](/wiki/Poverty_threshold \"Poverty threshold\").[v] When compared to Latin\nAmerica, Puerto Rico has the highest GDP per capita in the region. Its main\ntrading partners are the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\")\nitself, [Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\"), and\n[Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\"), with most products coming from [East\nAsia](/wiki/East_Asia \"East Asia\"), mainly from [China](/wiki/China \"China\"),\n[Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\"), and [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\").\nAt a global scale, Puerto Rico's dependency on oil for\n[transportation](/wiki/Transportation_in_Puerto_Rico \"Transportation in Puerto\nRico\") and electricity generation, as well as its dependency on food imports\nand raw materials, makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes\nin [the world economy](/wiki/Global_economy \"Global economy\") and\n[climate](/wiki/Climate \"Climate\"). Puerto Rico's agricultural sector\nrepresents less than 1% of GNP.[299]\n\n### Heavy debt load\n\nIn early 2017, the [Puerto Rican government-debt\ncrisis](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_government-debt_crisis \"Puerto Rican government-\ndebt crisis\") posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with\noutstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion at a time with a 45\npercent poverty rate and 12.4% unemployment that is more than twice the\nmainland U.S. average.[300] The debt had been increasing during a decade long\nrecession.[29]\n\nThe Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts, including bonds, since\n2015. With debt payments due, the Governor was facing the risk of a government\nshutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system.[301][302]\n\"Without action before April, Puerto Rico’s ability to execute contracts for\nFiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened,\nthereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to\n900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico\", according to a letter sent\nto Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services. They also said that \"Congress must enact measures recommended\nby both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico’s inequitable health\ncare financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\"[302]\n\nInitially, the oversight board created under [PROMESA](/wiki/PROMESA\n\"PROMESA\") called for Puerto Rico's governor [Ricardo\nRosselló](/wiki/Ricardo_Rossell%C3%B3 \"Ricardo Rosselló\") to deliver a fiscal\nturnaround plan by January 28. Just before that deadline, the control board\ngave the Commonwealth government until February 28 to present a fiscal plan\n(including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the\nproblems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to May 31.[29] It\nis essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a\nbankruptcy-like process under [PROMESA](/wiki/PROMESA \"PROMESA\").[303] An\ninternal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed\nthat the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations\nof the Board and the Rosselló government, with more than 80% of economists\narguing in favor of auditing the debt.[304]\n\nIn early August 2017, the island's financial oversight board (created by\nPROMESA) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for\ngovernment employees, down from the original plan of four days per month; the\nlatter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings. Governor Rossello\nrejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary. Pension reforms were also\ndiscussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin\naddressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.[32][305]\n\n### Public finances\n\nMain articles: [Puerto Rico government-debt\ncrisis](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_government-debt_crisis \"Puerto Rico government-debt\ncrisis\"), [Budget of the Government of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Budget_of_the_Government_of_Puerto_Rico \"Budget of the Government\nof Puerto Rico\"), and [public debt of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Public_debt_of_Puerto_Rico \"Public debt of Puerto Rico\")\n\nPuerto Rico has an [operating budget](/wiki/Operating_budget \"Operating\nbudget\") of about U.S.$9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion,\ncreating a structural deficit of $775 million (about 7.9% of the budget).[306]\nThe practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for\n18 consecutive years starting in 2000. Throughout those years, including\npresent time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected\ndeficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased\nPuerto Rico’s cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing\nbonds [to balance its actual\nbudget](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_government_budget_balance \"Puerto Rico government\nbudget balance\") for four decades since 1973.[w][308]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Budget-of-the-\ngovernment-of-puerto-rico-2012-percentage.png/400px-Budget-of-the-government-\nof-puerto-rico-2012-percentage.png)](/wiki/File:Budget-of-the-government-of-\npuerto-rico-2012-percentage.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Budget-of-the-government-of-puerto-rico-2012-percentage.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe 2012 Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico\n\nProjected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation\nwhich accrued [a public debt](/wiki/Public_debt_of_Puerto_Rico \"Public debt of\nPuerto Rico\") of $71B or about 70% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product.\nThis sparked [an ongoing government-debt crisis](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_government-\ndebt_crisis \"Puerto Rico government-debt crisis\") after Puerto Rico's general\nobligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade (\"junk\nstatus\") by three credit rating agencies. In terms of financial control,\nalmost 9.6%—or about $1.5 billion—of Puerto Rico's central government budget\nexpenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service.[x] Harsher budget\ncuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the\nfollowing years.[_[needs\nupdate](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_]\n\nFor practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a \"general\nbudget\" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the [Department\nof Treasury of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Department_of_Treasury_of_Puerto_Rico\n\"Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico\"), and the \"consolidated budget\" which\ncomprises the assignments funded by the general budget, by [Puerto Rico's\ngovernment-owned corporations](/wiki/List_of_government-\nowned_corporations_of_Puerto_Rico \"List of government-owned corporations of\nPuerto Rico\"), by revenue expected from loans, by the sale of government\nbonds, by subsidies extended by the [federal government of the United\nStates](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal government of\nthe United States\"), and by other funds.\n\nBoth budgets contrast each other drastically, with the consolidated budget\nbeing usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently $29B and $9.0B\nrespectively. Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget\ncomes from U.S. federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose\nmore than 31% of the consolidated budget.\n\nThe critical aspects come from the sale of bonds, which comprise 7% of the\nconsolidated budget – a ratio that increased annually due to the government's\ninability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of\ngenerating enough income to cover all its expenses. In particular, the\ngovernment-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and\npublic debt, as none is self-sufficient. For example, in FY2011 the\ngovernment-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3B\nwith the [Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation\nAuthority](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Highways_and_Transportation_Authority \"Puerto\nRico Highways and Transportation Authority\") (PRHTA) reporting losses of\n$409M, the [Puerto Rico Electric Power\nAuthority](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Electric_Power_Authority \"Puerto Rico Electric\nPower Authority\") (PREPA; the government monopoly that controls all\nelectricity on the island) reporting losses of $272M, while the [Puerto Rico\nAqueducts and Sewers\nAuthority](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Aqueducts_and_Sewers_Authority \"Puerto Rico\nAqueducts and Sewers Authority\") (PRASA; the government monopoly that controls\nall water utilities on the island) reported losses of $112M.[310]\n\nLosses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the\nissuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of Puerto Rico's entire public\ndebt today.[311] Holistically, from FY2000–FY2010 Puerto Rico's debt grew at a\n[compound annual growth rate](/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate \"Compound\nannual growth rate\") (CAGR) of 9% while GDP remained stagnant.[312] This has\nnot always provided a long-term solution. In early July 2017 for example, the\nPREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to\nrestructure $9 billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek Court\nprotection.[313]\n\nIn terms of protocol, the governor, together with the [Puerto Rico Office of\nManagement and Budget](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Office_of_Management_and_Budget\n\"Puerto Rico Office of Management and Budget\") (OGP in Spanish), formulates\nthe budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the\nensuing fiscal year. He then submits this formulation as a budget request to\nthe Puerto Rican legislature before July 1, the date established by law as the\nbeginning of Puerto Rico's fiscal year. While the constitution establishes\nthat the request must be submitted \"at the beginning of each regular session\",\nthe request is typically submitted during the first week of May as the regular\nsessions of the legislature begin in January and it would be impractical to\nsubmit a request so far in advance. Once submitted, the budget is then\napproved by the legislature, typically with amendments, through a [joint\nresolution](/wiki/Joint_resolution \"Joint resolution\") and is referred back to\nthe governor for his approval. The governor then either approves it or vetoes\nit. If vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments\nfor the governor's approval, or approve it without the governor's consent by\ntwo-thirds of the bodies of each chamber.[314]\n\nOnce the budget is approved, the Department of Treasury disburses funds to the\nOffice of Management and Budget which in turn disburses the funds to the\nrespective agencies, while the [Puerto Rico Government Development\nBank](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Government_Development_Bank \"Puerto Rico Government\nDevelopment Bank\") (the government's intergovernmental bank) manages all\nrelated banking affairs including those related to the government-owned\ncorporations.\n\n### Cost of living\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Map-of-jones-act-\ncarrier-routes-for-puerto-rico.png/350px-Map-of-jones-act-carrier-routes-for-\npuerto-rico.png)](/wiki/File:Map-of-jones-act-carrier-routes-for-puerto-\nrico.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Map-of-jones-act-carrier-routes-for-puerto-rico.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA map of [Jones Act](/wiki/Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920 \"Merchant Marine Act of\n1920\") carrier routes for Puerto Rico\n\nThe cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past\ndecade.[y][315][316][317][318][319][320][321] San Juan's in particular is\nhigher than [Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta \"Atlanta\"), [Dallas](/wiki/Dallas\n\"Dallas\"), and [Seattle](/wiki/Seattle \"Seattle\") but lower than\n[Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\"), [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\"), and [New\nYork City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\").[322] One factor is housing\nprices which are comparable to [Miami](/wiki/Miami \"Miami\") and [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\"), although property taxes are\nconsiderably lower than most places in the United States.[z]\n\nStatistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain\ncosts, such as the high cost of electricity, which has hovered in the 24¢ to\n30¢ range per kilowatt/hour, two to three times the national average,\nincreased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the\nloss of promotional participation opportunities for customers \"outside the\ncontinental United States\".

Conc. del S. 21.[327][328] These measures\nhave always received support from all the [major local political\nparties](/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_Puerto_Rico \"Political party\nstrength in Puerto Rico\").\n\nIn 2013 the [Government Accountability\nOffice](/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office \"Government Accountability\nOffice\") published a report which concluded that \"repealing or amending the\nJones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs\" and that\n\"shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could\nlower costs\".[ac][ad] However, the same GAO report also found that \"[shippers]\ndoing business in Puerto Rico that GAO contacted reported that the freight\nrates are often—although not always—lower for foreign carriers going to and\nfrom Puerto Rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship\nsimilar cargo to and from the United States, despite longer distances. Data\nwere not available to allow us to validate the examples given or verify the\nextent to which this difference occurred.\"[330] Ultimately, the report\nconcluded that \"[the] effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act\nfor Puerto Rico are highly uncertain\" for both Puerto Rico and the United\nStates, particularly for the [U.S. shipping\nindustry](/wiki/United_States_Merchant_Marine \"United States Merchant Marine\")\nand the military preparedness of the United States.[329][330]\n\n## Education\n\nMain article: [Education in Puerto Rico](/wiki/Education_in_Puerto_Rico\n\"Education in Puerto Rico\")\n\nThe first school in Puerto Rico was the _Escuela de Gramática_ (Grammar\nSchool).

The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin\nlanguage, literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.[331]\n\nEducation in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels—Primary (elementary school\ngrades 1–6), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7–12), and Higher\nLevel (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of\nthe Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and\n94.4% for females.[332] According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population\nattained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a\nbachelor's degree or higher.\n\nInstruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5\nand 18. As of\n2010[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Puerto_Rico&action=edit),\nthere are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.[333]\n\nThe largest and oldest university system is the public [University of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/University_of_Puerto_Rico \"University of Puerto Rico\") (UPR) with\n11 campuses. The largest private university systems on the island are the\n[Sistema Universitario Ana G.\nMendez](/wiki/Sistema_Universitario_Ana_G._Mendez \"Sistema Universitario Ana\nG.

Affordable medical insurance under the\n[Affordable Care Act](/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act \"Affordable Care Act\") is not\navailable in Puerto Rico as, since Puerto Ricans pay no income tax, no\nsubsidies are available.[334]\n\nThe city of [San Juan](/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico \"San Juan, Puerto Rico\")\nhas a system of [triage](/wiki/Triage \"Triage\"), hospital, and preventive care\nhealth services.

Normally, injured police officers and firefighters are cared for here.\n  * San Juan Pediatric Hospital – Also operated by the San Juan municipal government.\n  * Pediatric Hospital: Operated by the government of the Commonwealth, this is the main trauma hospital for pediatric cases.\n  * Centro Medico Emergency Room: This is the main hospital for trauma cases for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.\n  * _Centro Cardiovascular del Caribe_ (Caribbean Cardiovascular Center): This is the main hospital for open heart surgery in the Caribbean. It features a hotel for the patients' families.\n  * Psychiatric Hospital: The main psychiatric hospital in Puerto Rico. Operated by the government of Puerto Rico.\n  * Psychiatric Correctional Hospital: It is both a hospital and correctional facility. It is operated jointly by the Puerto Rico Department of Corrections and the Medical Services Administration.\n\nThe city of San Juan operates nine other hospitals.

In addition, [Hospital Oncológico Andrés\nGrillasca](/wiki/Hospital_Oncol%C3%B3gico_Andr%C3%A9s_Grillasca \"Hospital\nOncológico Andrés Grillasca\") specializes in the treatment of cancer,[337] and\nHospital Siquiátrico specializes in mental disorders.[338] There is also a\n[U.S. Department of Veterans\nAffairs](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs \"United States\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\") Outpatient Clinic that provides health\nservices to U.S. veterans.[339] The U.S. Veterans Administration will build a\nnew hospital in the city to satisfy regional needs.[340] Hospital de Damas is\nlisted in the [U.S. News & World Report](/wiki/U.S._News_%26_World_Report\n\"U.S. News & World Report\") as one of the best hospitals under the U.S.\nflag.[341] Ponce has the highest concentration of medical infrastructure per\ninhabitant of any municipality in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn the island of [Culebra](/wiki/Culebra,_Puerto_Rico \"Culebra, Puerto Rico\"),\nthere is a small hospital in the island called _Hospital de Culebra_. It also\noffers [pharmacy](/wiki/Pharmacy \"Pharmacy\") services to residents and\nvisitors. For emergencies, patients are transported by plane to\n[Fajardo](/wiki/Fajardo,_Puerto_Rico \"Fajardo, Puerto Rico\") on the main\nisland.[342]\n\nThe town of [Caguas](/wiki/Caguas \"Caguas\") has three hospitals: Hospital Hima\nSan Pablo, Menonita Caguas Regional Hospital, and the San Juan Bautista\nMedical Center.\n\nThe town of [Cayey](/wiki/Cayey \"Cayey\") is served by the _Hospital Menonita\nde Cayey_ , and the _Hospital Municipal de Cayey._\n\n_Reforma de Salud de Puerto Rico_ ([Puerto Rico Health\nReform](/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Health_Reform \"Puerto Rico Health Reform\")) –\nlocally referred to as _La Reforma_ (The Reform) – is a government-run program\nwhich provides medical and health care services to the indigent and\n[impoverished](/wiki/Impoverished \"Impoverished\"), by means of contracting\nprivate [health insurance](/wiki/Health_insurance \"Health insurance\")\ncompanies, rather than employing government-owned hospitals and emergency\ncenters. The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance\nAdministration.[343]\n\n### Crime\n\nSee also: [Illegal drugs in Puerto Rico](/wiki/Illegal_drugs_in_Puerto_Rico\n\"Illegal drugs in Puerto Rico\")\n\nThe overall rate of crime is low in Puerto Rico. The territory has a high\nfirearm homicide rate. The homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was\nsignificantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014.[344][345] Most homicide\nvictims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80% of homicides in\nPuerto Rico being drug related.[346]\n\n## Culture\n\nMain article: [Culture of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Culture_of_Puerto_Rico \"Culture\nof Puerto Rico\")\n\nModern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including\nEuropean (predominantly Spanish, Italian, French, German and Irish), African,\nand, more recently, some North American and lots of South Americans. A large\nnumber of Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few\ndecades.\n\nFrom the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic\nreligion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and\ntraditions. The United States added English-language influence, the university\nsystem and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On March 12, 1903, the\n[University of Puerto Rico](/wiki/University_of_Puerto_Rico \"University of\nPuerto Rico\") was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal\nIndustrial\", a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years\nbefore.\n\nMuch of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been\nshaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms. Early\nin the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of Spanish and African\ntraditions were most noticeable. The cultural movements across the Caribbean\nand North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical\ninfluences which have reached Puerto Rico.[347][348]\n\nThe official symbols of Puerto Rico are the _reinita mora_ or [Puerto Rican\nspindalis](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_spindalis \"Puerto Rican spindalis\") (a type of\nbird), the [_flor de maga_](/wiki/Thespesia_grandiflora \"Thespesia\ngrandiflora\") (a type of flower), and the _ceiba_ or\n[kapok](/wiki/Ceiba_pentandra \"Ceiba pentandra\") (a type of tree). The\nunofficial animal and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the\n[coquí](/wiki/Common_coqu%C3%AD \"Common coquí\"), a small frog. Other popular\nsymbols of Puerto Rico are the _[jíbaro](/wiki/J%C3%ADbaro \"Jíbaro\")_ (the\n\"countryman\"), and the carite.\n\n### Architecture\n\nMain article: [Architecture of Puerto Rico](/wiki/Architecture_of_Puerto_Rico\n\"Architecture of Puerto Rico\")\n\nThe architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions,\nstyles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish\nrule, and a century of American rule. [Spanish colonial\narchitecture](/wiki/Spanish_colonial_architecture \"Spanish colonial\narchitecture\"), [Ibero-Islamic](/wiki/Islamic_architecture \"Islamic\narchitecture\"), [art deco](/wiki/Art_deco \"Art deco\"), [post-\nmodern](/wiki/Post-modern_architecture \"Post-modern architecture\"), and many\nother architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to\ntown, there are also many regional distinctions.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/The_Colors_of_Old_San_Juan_%2828488284470%29.jpg/300px-\nThe_Colors_of_Old_San_Juan_%2828488284470%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Colors_of_Old_San_Juan_\\(28488284470\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Colors_of_Old_San_Juan_\\(28488284470\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Old San Juan](/wiki/Old_San_Juan \"Old San Juan\")\n\nOld San Juan is one of the two _barrios_ , in addition to\n[Santurce](/wiki/Santurce,_San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico \"Santurce, San Juan, Puerto\nRico\"), that made up the [municipality](/wiki/Municipality \"Municipality\") of\nSan Juan from 1864 to 1951, at which time the former independent municipality\nof [Río Piedras](/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Piedras \"Río Piedras\") was annexed. With its\nabundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air cafés, restaurants,\ngracious homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectonical\npeculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism. The\ndistrict is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches\nincluding [San José Church](/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9_Church \"San José Church\") and\nthe [Cathedral of San Juan Bautista](/wiki/Cathedral_of_San_Juan_Bautista\n\"Cathedral of San Juan Bautista\"), which contains the tomb of the Spanish\nexplorer [Juan Ponce de León](/wiki/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n \"Juan Ponce de\nLeón\"). It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in\nPuerto Rico, the Colegio de Párvulos, built in 1865.\n\nThe oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by\nmassive walls. Several defensive structures and notable [forts](/wiki/Fort\n\"Fort\"), such as the emblematic [Fort San Felipe del\nMorro](/wiki/Fort_San_Felipe_del_Morro \"Fort San Felipe del Morro\"), [Fort San\nCristóbal](/wiki/Castillo_San_Crist%C3%B3bal_\\(San_Juan\\) \"Castillo San\nCristóbal \\(San Juan\\)\"), and [El Palacio de Santa\nCatalina](/wiki/El_Palacio_de_Santa_Catalina \"El Palacio de Santa Catalina\"),\nalso known as [La Fortaleza](/wiki/La_Fortaleza \"La Fortaleza\"), acted as the\nprimary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks.\n[La Fortaleza](/wiki/La_Fortaleza \"La Fortaleza\") continues to serve also as\nthe executive mansion for the [Governor of Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Governor_of_Puerto_Rico \"Governor of Puerto Rico\"). Many of the\nhistoric fortifications are part of [San Juan National Historic\nSite](/wiki/San_Juan_National_Historic_Site \"San Juan National Historic\nSite\").\n\nDuring the 1940s, sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair, and many\nrenovation plans were suggested. There was even a strong push to develop Old\nSan Juan as a \"small [Manhattan](/wiki/Manhattan \"Manhattan\")\". Strict\nremodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting\nthe common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. When a\nproject proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be\ndemolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared as a\nhistoric building, and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed\nfacility. This was what became the _Hotel El Convento_ in Old San Juan. The\nparadigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been\nfollowed by other cities in the Americas, particularly [Havana](/wiki/Havana\n\"Havana\"), [Lima](/wiki/Lima \"Lima\") and [Cartagena de\nIndias](/wiki/Cartagena_de_Indias \"Cartagena de Indias\").\n\nPonce Creole is an [architectural style](/wiki/Architectural_style\n\"Architectural style\") created in [Ponce, Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Ponce,_Puerto_Rico \"Ponce, Puerto Rico\"), in the late 19th and\nearly 20th centuries. This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found\npredominantly in residential homes in [Ponce](/wiki/Ponce,_Puerto_Rico \"Ponce,\nPuerto Rico\") that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture\nborrows heavily from the traditions of the French, the Spaniards, and the\nCaribbean to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and\ndry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes\ncharacteristic of the southern Puerto Rico's [Caribbean\nSea](/wiki/Caribbean_Sea \"Caribbean Sea\") coast.[349] It is a blend of wood\nand masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from\n[Classical revival](/wiki/Classical_revival \"Classical revival\") and [Spanish\nRevival](/wiki/Spanish_Revival \"Spanish Revival\") to\n[Victorian](/wiki/Victorian_architecture \"Victorian architecture\").[350]\n\n### Arts\n\nMain article: [Puerto Rican art](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_art \"Puerto Rican art\")\n\nPuerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse\nbackground. A form of [folk art](/wiki/Folk_art \"Folk art\"), called _santos_\nevolved from the Catholic Church's use of [sculptures](/wiki/Sculpture\n\"Sculpture\") to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to\n[Christianity](/wiki/Christianity \"Christianity\"). _Santos_ depict figures of\nsaints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and\nstone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid\ncolors. _Santos_ vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches\ntall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen\nas messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special\nplace on household [altars](/wiki/Altar \"Altar\"), where people prayed to them,\nasked for help, or tried to summon their protection.\n\nAlso popular, _caretas_ or _vejigantes_ are masks worn during\n[carnivals](/wiki/Carnival \"Carnival\"). Similar masks signifying evil spirits\nwere used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish\nused their masks to frighten lapsed [Christians](/wiki/Christians\n\"Christians\") into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as\nprotection from the evil spirits they represented. True to their historic\norigins Puerto Rican _caretas_ always bear at least several horns and fangs.\nWhile usually constructed of [papier-mâché](/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9\n\"Papier-mâché\"), coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as\nwell. Red and black were the typical colors for _caretas_ but their palette\nhas expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns.\n\n### Literature\n\nMain article: [Puerto Rican literature](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_literature \"Puerto\nRican literature\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Retrato_de_EMdeHostos_por_Francisco_Oller.jpg/170px-\nRetrato_de_EMdeHostos_por_Francisco_Oller.jpg)](/wiki/File:Retrato_de_EMdeHostos_por_Francisco_Oller.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Retrato_de_EMdeHostos_por_Francisco_Oller.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Eugenio María de Hostos](/wiki/Eugenio_Mar%C3%ADa_de_Hostos \"Eugenio María de\nHostos\")\n\nPuerto Rican literature evolved from the art of [oral story\ntelling](/wiki/Oral_literature \"Oral literature\") to its present-day status.\nWritten works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and\nrepressed by the Spanish colonial government. Only those who were commissioned\nby the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were\nallowed to write.\n\n[Diego de Torres Vargas](/wiki/Diego_de_Torres_Vargas \"Diego de Torres\nVargas\") was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition for three reasons:\nhe was a priest, he came from a prosperous Spanish family, and his father was\na Sergeant Major in the Spanish Army, who died while defending Puerto Rico\nfrom an invasion by the [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_people \"Dutch people\") armada. In\n1647, Torres Vargas wrote _Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico_\n(\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\"). This historical book\nwas the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.[351]\n\nThe book described all the fruits and commercial establishments of the time,\nmostly centered in the towns of San Juan and Ponce. The book also listed and\ndescribed every mine, church, and hospital in the island at the time. The book\ncontained notices on the State and Capital, plus an extensive and erudite\nbibliography. _Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico_ was the first\nsuccessful attempt at writing a comprehensive history of Puerto Rico.[351]\n\nSome of Puerto Rico's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of\n[Rafael Cordero](/wiki/Rafael_Cordero_\\(educator\\) \"Rafael Cordero\n\\(educator\\)\"). Among these was Dr. [Manuel A. Alonso](/wiki/Manuel_A._Alonso\n\"Manuel A. Alonso\"), the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance. In\n1849 he published _El Gíbaro_ , a collection of verses whose main themes were\nthe poor Puerto Rican country farmer. [Eugenio María de\nHostos](/wiki/Eugenio_Mar%C3%ADa_de_Hostos \"Eugenio María de Hostos\") wrote\n_La peregrinación de Bayoán_ in 1863, which used Bartolomé de las Casas as a\nspring board to reflect on Caribbean identity. After this first novel, Hostos\nabandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater\npossibilities for inspiring social change.\n\nIn the late 19th century, with the arrival of the first printing press and the\nfounding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters, Puerto Rican literature began\nto flourish. The first writers to express their political views in regard to\nSpanish colonial rule of the island were journalists. After the United States\ninvaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War and the island was ceded\nto the Americans as a condition of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, writers and\npoets began to express their opposition to the new colonial rule by writing\nabout patriotic themes.\n\n[Alejandro Tapia y Rivera](/wiki/Alejandro_Tapia_y_Rivera \"Alejandro Tapia y\nRivera\"), also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature, ushered in a\nnew age of [historiography](/wiki/Historiography \"Historiography\") with the\npublication of _The Historical Library of Puerto Rico_. [Cayetano Coll y\nToste](/wiki/Cayetano_Coll_y_Toste \"Cayetano Coll y Toste\") was another Puerto\nRican historian and writer. His work _The Indo-Antillano Vocabulary_ is\nvaluable in understanding the way the [Taínos](/wiki/Ta%C3%ADnos \"Taínos\")\nlived. Dr. [Manuel Zeno Gandía](/wiki/Manuel_Zeno_Gand%C3%ADa \"Manuel Zeno\nGandía\") in 1894 wrote _La Charca_ and told about the harsh life in the remote\nand mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. Dr. [Antonio S.\nPedreira](/wiki/Antonio_S._Pedreira \"Antonio S. Pedreira\"), described in his\nwork _Insularismo_ the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after\nthe American invasion.\n\nWith the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s, Puerto Rican literature was\ngreatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the [Nuyorican\nMovement](/wiki/Nuyorican_Movement \"Nuyorican Movement\"). Puerto Rican\nliterature continued to flourish and many Puerto Ricans have since\ndistinguished themselves as authors, journalists, poets, novelists,\nplaywrights, screenwriters, essayists and have also stood out in other\nliterary fields. The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the\nboundaries of the island to the United States and the rest of the world. Over\nthe past fifty years, significant writers include [Ed Vega](/wiki/Ed_Vega \"Ed\nVega\"), [Luis Rafael Sánchez](/wiki/Luis_Rafael_S%C3%A1nchez \"Luis Rafael\nSánchez\"), [Piri Thomas](/wiki/Piri_Thomas \"Piri Thomas\"), [Giannina\nBraschi](/wiki/Giannina_Braschi \"Giannina Braschi\"), and [Miguel\nPiñero](/wiki/Miguel_Pi%C3%B1ero \"Miguel Piñero\"). [Esmeralda\nSantiago](/wiki/Esmeralda_Santiago \"Esmeralda Santiago\") has written an\nautobiographical trilogy about growing up in modern Puerto Rico as well as an\nhistorical novel, _Conquistadora_ , about life on a sugar plantation during\nthe mid-19th century.\n\n### Media\n\nMain article: [Media in Puerto Rico](/wiki/Media_in_Puerto_Rico \"Media in\nPuerto Rico\")\n\nThe [media](/wiki/Mass_media \"Mass media\") in Puerto Rico includes local\n[radio stations](/wiki/Radio_stations \"Radio stations\"), [television\nstations](/wiki/Television_stations \"Television stations\") and\n[newspapers](/wiki/Newspapers \"Newspapers\"), the majority of which are\nconducted in [Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_language \"Spanish language\").

The most conspicuous musical sources have been\nSpain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect\norigins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and, over the last century, from\nthe U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of\ngenres, ranging from indigenous genres like\n[bomba](/wiki/Bomba_\\(Puerto_Rico\\) \"Bomba \\(Puerto Rico\\)\"),\n[plena](/wiki/Plena \"Plena\"), [aguinaldo](/wiki/Aguinaldo \"Aguinaldo\"),\n[danza](/wiki/Danza \"Danza\") and [salsa](/wiki/Salsa_music \"Salsa music\") to\nrecent hybrids like [reggaeton](/wiki/Reggaeton \"Reggaeton\").\n\nPuerto Rico has some national instruments, like the\n[cuatro](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_cuatro \"Puerto Rican cuatro\") (Spanish for\n\"four\"). The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the \"Jibaro\" or\npeople from the mountains. Originally, the Cuatro consisted of four steel\nstrings, hence its name, but currently the Cuatro consists of five double\nsteel strings. It is easily confused with a guitar, even by locals.

In\nthe latter part of the 19th century, the cuisine of Puerto Rico was greatly\ninfluenced by the [United States](/wiki/Cuisine_of_the_United_States \"Cuisine\nof the United States\") in the ingredients used in its preparation. Puerto\nRican cuisine has transcended the boundaries of the island, and can be found\nin several countries outside the [archipelago](/wiki/Archipelago\n\"Archipelago\").
