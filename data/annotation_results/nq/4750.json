He grew up in [Nyack, New\nYork](/wiki/Nyack,_New_York \"Nyack, New York\"), along with the MacArthurs'\nbiological daughter, Mary. He was educated at [Allen-Stevenson\nSchool](/wiki/Allen-Stevenson_School \"Allen-Stevenson School\") in New York,\nand later at the [Solebury School](/wiki/Solebury_School \"Solebury School\") in\n[New Hope, Pennsylvania](/wiki/New_Hope,_Pennsylvania \"New Hope,\nPennsylvania\"), where he starred in basketball,\n[football](/wiki/American_football \"American football\") and baseball. In his\nfinal year at Solebury, MacArthur played guard on the football team; captained\nthe basketball team; was president of his class, the student government, and\nthe Drama Club; rewrote the school's constitution; edited the school paper,\n_The Scribe_ ; and played [Scrooge](/wiki/Ebenezer_Scrooge \"Ebenezer Scrooge\")\nin a local presentation of _[A Christmas Carol](/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol \"A\nChristmas Carol\")_. He also started dating a fellow student, future actress\n[Joyce Bulifant](/wiki/Joyce_Bulifant \"Joyce Bulifant\"); they were married in\nNovember 1958 and divorced nine years later.\n\nMacArthur grew up around the greatest literary and theatrical talent of the\ntime. [Lillian Gish](/wiki/Lillian_Gish \"Lillian Gish\") was his godmother, and\nhis family's guests included [Ben Hecht](/wiki/Ben_Hecht \"Ben Hecht\"), [Harpo\nMarx](/wiki/Harpo_Marx \"Harpo Marx\"), [Robert Benchley](/wiki/Robert_Benchley\n\"Robert Benchley\"), [Beatrice Lillie](/wiki/Beatrice_Lillie \"Beatrice\nLillie\"), [John Barrymore](/wiki/John_Barrymore \"John Barrymore\") and [John\nSteinbeck](/wiki/John_Steinbeck \"John Steinbeck\"). His first\n[radio](/wiki/Old-time_radio \"Old-time radio\") role was on the _[Theatre Guild\non the Air](/wiki/The_United_States_Steel_Hour \"The United States Steel\nHour\")_ , in 1948. _Theatre Guild on the Air_ was the premier radio program of\nits day, producing one-hour plays that were performed in front of a live\naudience of 800. Helen Hayes accepted a role in one of the plays, which also\nhad a small role for a child. Her son was asked if he would like to do it, and\nhe agreed.\n\n## Acting\ncareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=James_MacArthur&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Acting career\")]\n\nMacArthur made his stage debut at [Olney, Maryland](/wiki/Olney,_Maryland\n\"Olney, Maryland\") in 1949, with a two-week stint in _[The Corn Is\nGreen](/wiki/The_Corn_Is_Green \"The Corn Is Green\")_. His sister Mary was in\nthe play and telephoned their mother to request that James go to Olney to be\nin it with her. The following summer, he repeated the role at [Dennis,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Dennis,_Massachusetts \"Dennis, Massachusetts\"), and his\ntheatrical career was underway. In 1954, he played John Day in _[Life with\nFather](/wiki/Life_with_Father \"Life with Father\")_ with [Howard\nLindsay](/wiki/Howard_Lindsay \"Howard Lindsay\") and [Dorothy\nStickney](/wiki/Dorothy_Stickney \"Dorothy Stickney\"). He became involved in\nimportant [Broadway](/wiki/Broadway_theatre \"Broadway theatre\") productions\nonly after receiving his training in [summer stock\ntheatre](/wiki/Summer_stock_theatre \"Summer stock theatre\").\n\nMacArthur also worked as a set painter, lighting director, and chief of the\nparking lot. During a Helen Hayes festival at the Falmouth Playhouse on [Cape\nCod](/wiki/Cape_Cod \"Cape Cod\"), he had a few walk-on parts. He also helped\nthe theatre electrician, and grew so interested that he was allowed to stay on\nafter his mother's plays had ended. As a result, he lit the show for [Barbara\nBel Geddes](/wiki/Barbara_Bel_Geddes \"Barbara Bel Geddes\") in _The Little Hut_\nand for [Gloria Vanderbilt](/wiki/Gloria_Vanderbilt \"Gloria Vanderbilt\") in\n_The Swan_. When he visited Paris with his mother as a member of _[The Skin of\nOur Teeth](/wiki/The_Skin_of_Our_Teeth \"The Skin of Our Teeth\")_ company, he\nwas in charge of making thunder backstage with a sheet of metal.\n\nAt the age of 18, he played Hal Ditmar in the television play, _Deal a Blow_ ,\ndirected by [John Frankenheimer](/wiki/John_Frankenheimer \"John\nFrankenheimer\") and starring [Macdonald Carey](/wiki/Macdonald_Carey\n\"Macdonald Carey\"), [Phyllis Thaxter](/wiki/Phyllis_Thaxter \"Phyllis\nThaxter\"), and [Edward Arnold](/wiki/Edward_Arnold_\\(actor\\) \"Edward Arnold\n\\(actor\\)\"). In 1956, Frankenheimer directed the movie version of the play,\nwhich was renamed _[The Young Stranger](/wiki/The_Young_Stranger \"The Young\nStranger\")_ , with MacArthur again in the starring role. Again, his\nperformance was critically acclaimed, earning him a nomination for Most\nPromising Newcomer at the 1958\n[BAFTA](/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts \"British Academy of\nFilm and Television Arts\") awards.[1] He made _[The Light in the\nForest](/wiki/The_Light_in_the_Forest_\\(film\\) \"The Light in the Forest\n\\(film\\)\")_ and _[Third Man on the Mountain](/wiki/Third_Man_on_the_Mountain\n\"Third Man on the Mountain\")_ , for [Walt Disney](/wiki/Walt_Disney \"Walt\nDisney\"), during summer breaks from [Harvard\nUniversity](/wiki/Harvard_University \"Harvard University\"), where he was\nstudying history.\n\nDeciding to make acting his full-time career, he left Harvard in his second\nyear to make two more Disney movies,\n_[Kidnapped](/wiki/Kidnapped_\\(1960_film\\) \"Kidnapped \\(1960 film\\)\")_ and\n_[Swiss Family Robinson](/wiki/Swiss_Family_Robinson_\\(1960_film\\) \"Swiss\nFamily Robinson \\(1960 film\\)\")_.\n\nMacArthur made his Broadway debut in 1960, playing opposite [Jane\nFonda](/wiki/Jane_Fonda \"Jane Fonda\") in _Invitation to a March_ , for which\nhe received a [Theatre World Award](/wiki/Theatre_World_Award \"Theatre World\nAward\"). Although he never returned to Broadway, he remained active in\ntheatre, appearing in such productions as _[Under the Yum Yum\nTree](/wiki/Under_the_Yum_Yum_Tree \"Under the Yum Yum Tree\")_ , _[The Moon Is\nBlue](/wiki/The_Moon_Is_Blue \"The Moon Is Blue\")_ , _John Loves Mary_ (with\nhis then wife, Joyce Bulifant), _[Barefoot in the\nPark](/wiki/Barefoot_in_the_Park \"Barefoot in the Park\")_ , and _[Murder at\nthe Howard Johnson's](/wiki/Murder_at_the_Howard_Johnson%27s \"Murder at the\nHoward Johnson's\")_. He also released several records in the early 1960s,[2]\nscoring two minor hits with \"(The Story of) The In-Between Years\" and \"The Ten\nCommandments of Love\", both of which peaked at number 94 in the _Billboard_\nHot 100.\n\nHe then went on to roles in movies including _[The\nInterns](/wiki/The_Interns_\\(film\\) \"The Interns \\(film\\)\")_ , _[Spencer's\nMountain](/wiki/Spencer%27s_Mountain \"Spencer's Mountain\")_, _[The Truth About\nSpring](/wiki/The_Truth_About_Spring \"The Truth About Spring\")_ , and _[Cry of\nBattle](/wiki/Cry_of_Battle \"Cry of Battle\")_ , as well as _[The Love-\nIns](/wiki/The_Love-Ins \"The Love-Ins\")_ and _The Angry Breed_. On the set of\n_The Angry Breed_ , in 1968, MacArthur met [Melody\nPatterson](/wiki/Melody_Patterson \"Melody Patterson\"), who was to become his\nsecond wife. They were married on the Hawaiian Island of [Kauai](/wiki/Kauai\n\"Kauai\") in July 1970, and divorced five years later. In 1963, he was\nnominated for the \"Top New Male Personality\" category of the Golden Laurel\nAwards.[3]\n\nBetween movie and theatre roles, MacArthur was also in demand for television\nguest appearances, which included roles in _[Studio\nOne](/wiki/Westinghouse_Studio_One \"Westinghouse Studio One\")_ , _[GE\nTheatre](/wiki/General_Electric_Theater \"General Electric Theater\")_ , _[Bus\nStop](/wiki/Bus_Stop_\\(play\\) \"Bus Stop \\(play\\)\")_ the play, _[Bus\nStop](/wiki/Bus_Stop_\\(TV_series\\) \"Bus Stop \\(TV series\\)\")_ the television\nseries, _[Bonanza](/wiki/Bonanza \"Bonanza\")_ , _[Gunsmoke](/wiki/Gunsmoke\n\"Gunsmoke\")_ , _[Wagon Train](/wiki/Wagon_Train \"Wagon Train\")_ , _[The\nEleventh Hour](/wiki/The_Eleventh_Hour_\\(U.S._TV_series\\) \"The Eleventh Hour\n\\(U.S. TV series\\)\")_ , _[The Great\nAdventure](/wiki/The_Great_Adventure_\\(U.S._TV_series\\) \"The Great Adventure\n\\(U.S. TV series\\)\")_ , _[The Alfred Hitchcock\nHour](/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\")_ ,\n_[Combat!](/wiki/Combat! \"Combat!\")_ , and _[The\nVirginian](/wiki/The_Virginian_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Virginian \\(TV series\\)\")_.\n\nIn 1966, he guest-starred as Lt. Harley Wilson in \"The Outsider\", episode 20\nin the second season of _[Twelve O'Clock High](/wiki/Twelve_O%27Clock_High\n\"Twelve O'Clock High\")_ (TV series). He co-starred with his mother Helen Hayes\nin the 1968 episode \"The Pride of the Lioness\" on the\n_[Tarzan](/wiki/Tarzan_\\(1966_TV_series\\) \"Tarzan \\(1966 TV series\\)\")_\ntelevision series. MacArthur also gave a particularly chilling performance as\nbaby-faced opium dealer Johnny Lubin in _[The\nUntouchables](/wiki/The_Untouchables_\\(1959_TV_series\\) \"The Untouchables\n\\(1959 TV series\\)\")_ episode, \"Death For Sale\".\n\nThough many of his movie roles were not starring roles, and some were quite\nbrief, they were usually pivotal to the plot. His role in _[The Bedford\nIncident](/wiki/The_Bedford_Incident \"The Bedford Incident\")_ was that of a\nyoung [ensign](/wiki/Ensign_\\(rank\\) \"Ensign \\(rank\\)\") who became so rattled\nby the needling of his captain ([Richard Widmark](/wiki/Richard_Widmark\n\"Richard Widmark\")), that he accidentally fired an [ASROC](/wiki/Anti-\nsubmarine_missile \"Anti-submarine missile\") at a Soviet submarine, thus\ncreating a nuclear incident when the submarine returned fire, resulting in the\ndestruction of both vessels.\n\nIn _[Battle of the Bulge](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge_\\(film\\) \"Battle of the\nBulge \\(film\\)\")_ , he again played the role of a young and inexperienced\nofficer. However, this time, the officer found courage and a sense of\nresponsibility. His brief but memorable appearance in the [Clint\nEastwood](/wiki/Clint_Eastwood \"Clint Eastwood\") movie, _[Hang'Em\nHigh](/wiki/Hang_%27Em_High \"Hang 'Em High\")_ eventually led to his role as\nDan Williams in _[Hawaii Five-O](/wiki/Hawaii_Five-O_\\(1968_TV_series\\)\n\"Hawaii Five-O \\(1968 TV series\\)\")_ , popularizing the\n[catchphrase](/wiki/Catchphrase \"Catchphrase\") \"Book 'em, Danno\".\n\n## _Hawaii Five-\nO_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=James_MacArthur&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Hawaii Five-O\")]\n\nIn 1967, [Leonard Freeman](/wiki/Leonard_Freeman \"Leonard Freeman\"), the\nproducer and co-writer of _Hang 'Em High_, made the pilot for a new television\npolice series, _[Hawaii Five-O](/wiki/Hawaii_Five-O_\\(1968_TV_series\\) \"Hawaii\nFive-O \\(1968 TV series\\)\")_. Before it went to air, the pilot was well\nreceived by test audiences, except for some dislike of the actor playing Dan\nWilliams.\n\nFreeman remembered MacArthur's portrayal of the traveling preacher in _Hang\n'Em High_ – MacArthur had come on the set and done the scene in one take. He\ncalled MacArthur and offered him the role of Dan Williams.\n\nThe show was popularized by its opening sequence and theme music and location\nfilming in Hawaii. It was not in the top 30 in ratings until its second\nseason, when it was rated number 19. For the next five seasons, the show's\nratings were always in the top 10, topped by its number-three rating and 25.2\nshare in 1972–73.\n\nMany episodes ended with Hawaii Five-O chief Steve McGarrett ([Jack\nLord](/wiki/Jack_Lord \"Jack Lord\")) instructing Williams (MacArthur) to \"Book\n'em, Danno!\" (sometimes followed by stating a charge such as \"murder one\"),\nwhich became a well-known catch phrase in popular culture. _Hawaii Five-O_ was\nthe longest-running TV crime drama until it was finally surpassed by _[Law&\nOrder](/wiki/Law_%26_Order \"Law & Order\")_ in 2003.\n\nMacArthur has said that one of his favorite episodes was \"Retire in Sunny\nHawaii Forever\" (1975), which starred his mother, Helen Hayes. She played\nDanno's Aunt Clara, who visits Hawaii and helps the detectives solve a\nmurder.[4]\n\n_Hawaii Five-O_ ran for 12 years – 11 with MacArthur. Leaving the show at the\nend of its 11th season, MacArthur returned to the theatre, appearing in _The\nLunch Hour_ with [Cybill Shepherd](/wiki/Cybill_Shepherd \"Cybill Shepherd\").\n\n## After _Hawaii Five-\nO_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=James_MacArthur&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: After Hawaii Five-O\")]\n\nHe appeared in _A Bedfull of Foreigners_ in Chicago in 1984, and in Michigan\nin 1985. He followed this with _The Hasty Heart_ , before taking a year out of\nshow business. In 1987, he returned to the stage in _The Foreigner_ , then\nplayed Mortimer in the national tour of _Arsenic and Old Lace_ with [Jean\nStapleton](/wiki/Jean_Stapleton \"Jean Stapleton\"), [Marion\nRoss](/wiki/Marion_Ross \"Marion Ross\"), and [Larry Storch](/wiki/Larry_Storch\n\"Larry Storch\"). In 1989, he followed another stint in _The Foreigner_ with\n_Love Letters_ , and in 1990–1991, _A Bedfull of Foreigners_ , this time in\nLas Vegas.\n\nAfter leaving _Hawaii Five-O_ , McArthur guest-starred on such television\nshows as _[Murder, She Wrote](/wiki/Murder,_She_Wrote \"Murder, She Wrote\")_ ,\n_[The Love Boat](/wiki/The_Love_Boat \"The Love Boat\")_ , _[Fantasy\nIsland](/wiki/Fantasy_Island \"Fantasy Island\")_ , and _[Vega$](/wiki/Vega$\n\"Vega$\")_ , as well as in the miniseries _Alcatraz: The Whole Shocking Story_\nand _The Night the Bridge Fell Down_ , and in the television movie\n_Stormchasers: Revenge of the Twister_ (1998), with [Kelly\nMcGillis](/wiki/Kelly_McGillis \"Kelly McGillis\").\n\n##\nSemiretirement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=James_MacArthur&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Semiretirement\")]\n\nThroughout his career, MacArthur had also found time for various other\nventures. From 1959 to 1960, he partnered with actors [James\nFranciscus](/wiki/James_Franciscus \"James Franciscus\") and [Alan Ladd,\nJr.](/wiki/Alan_Ladd,_Jr. \"Alan Ladd, Jr.\") in a Beverly Hills telephone\nanswering service. In June 1972, he directed the Honolulu Community Theatre in\na production of his father's play _[The Front Page](/wiki/The_Front_Page \"The\nFront Page\")_. For a period in the 1990s, he was part owner of Senior World\npublication, as well as writing the occasional celebrity interview. He\ncontinued to appear at conventions, collectors' shows, and celebrity sporting\nevents. A keen golfer, he was the winner of the 2002 Frank Sinatra\nInvitational Charity Golf Tournament.\n\nHe also appeared in television and radio specials and interview programs. His\nlatest appearances included spots on _Entertainment Tonight_ , _Christopher 's\nCloseup_, and the [BBC Radio 5 Live](/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live \"BBC Radio 5\nLive\") obituary program _Brief Lives_ , in which he paid tribute to his\n_Hawaii Five-O_ castmate, the late [Kam Fong](/wiki/Kam_Fong_Chun \"Kam Fong\nChun\"). In 1997, MacArthur returned without Jack Lord (who was in declining\nhealth) to reprise his character, who had become Hawaii's governor in the\nplot, in the 1997 unaired pilot of _Hawaii Five-O_ which starred actor [Gary\nBusey](/wiki/Gary_Busey \"Gary Busey\").\n\nIn April 2003, he traveled to Honolulu's historic Hawaii Theatre for a cameo\nrole in [Joe Moore](/wiki/Joe_Moore_\\(television_journalist\\) \"Joe Moore\n\\(television journalist\\)\")'s play _Dirty Laundry_. Negotiations were underway\nin summer 2010 for MacArthur to make a cameo appearance in the new CBS\nprimetime _[remake of Hawaii Five-O](/wiki/Hawaii_Five-0_\\(2010_TV_series\\)\n\"Hawaii Five-0 \\(2010 TV series\\)\")_ at the time of his death, a role that\neventually was given to Al Harrington. On the November 1, 2010, episode,\nMacArthur's death was mentioned in a short tribute that played before the\nstart of that episode.\n\nIn 2001, a Golden Palm Star on the [Palm Springs Walk of\nStars](/wiki/Palm_Springs_Walk_of_Stars \"Palm Springs Walk of Stars\") was\ndedicated to him.[5]\n\n## Death[[edit](/w/index.php?title=James_MacArthur&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Death\")]\n\nMacArthur died of cancer on October 28, 2010, at the age of 72, at the [Mayo\nClinic](/wiki/Mayo_Clinic \"Mayo Clinic\") in [Jacksonville,\nFlorida](/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida \"Jacksonville, Florida\"). At the time of\ndeath, he was a resident of [Palm Desert,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Palm_Desert,_California \"Palm Desert, California\").
