Roxb.  \n  \n_**Triadica sebifera**_ , also known as _**Sapium sebiferum**_ , is commonly\nknown as the **Chinese tallow** ,[1] **Chinese tallowtree** , **Florida\naspen** , **chicken tree** , **gray popcorn tree** ,[2] and **candleberry\ntree**.[3] The tree is native to eastern [Asia](/wiki/Asia \"Asia\"), and is\nmost commonly associated with eastern [China](/wiki/China \"China\"),\n[Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\"), and [Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\"). In these\nregions, the waxy coating of the seeds is used for [candle](/wiki/Candle\n\"Candle\") and [soap](/wiki/Soap \"Soap\") making, and the [leaves](/wiki/Leaf\n\"Leaf\") are used as [herbal medicine](/wiki/Herbal_medicine \"Herbal medicine\")\nto treat boils. The plant [sap](/wiki/Sap \"Sap\") and leaves are reputed to be\ntoxic, and decaying leaves from the plant are toxic to other species of\n[plant](/wiki/Plant \"Plant\"). The specific epithets _sebifera_ and _sebiferum_\nmean \"wax-bearing\" and refer to the vegetable tallow that coats the seeds.\n\nIt is useful in the production of [biodiesel](/wiki/Biodiesel \"Biodiesel\")\nbecause it is the third most productive vegetable oil producing crop in the\nworld, after [algae](/wiki/Algae \"Algae\") and [oil palm](/wiki/Oil_palm \"Oil\npalm\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] This species is documented as a noxious invader in the southern\nU.S.[4][5]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Physical characteristics\n  * 2 Range and habitat\n  * 3 Uses\n  * 4 Invasive species\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Physical\ncharacteristics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triadica_sebifera&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Physical characteristics\")]\n\nThe simple, deciduous leaves of this tree are alternate, broad\n[rhombic](/wiki/Rhombus \"Rhombus\") to ovate in shape and have smooth edges,\nheart shaped and sometimes with an extended tail often resembling the bo tree,\n[Ficus religiosa](/wiki/Ficus_religiosa \"Ficus religiosa\"). The leaves are\nbright green in color and slightly paler underneath. They become bright\nyellows, oranges, purples and reds in the autumn. The tree is\n[monoecious](/wiki/Monoecious \"Monoecious\"), producing male and female flowers\non the same plant.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/ChineseTallowSeedpods.jpg/220px-\nChineseTallowSeedpods.jpg)](/wiki/File:ChineseTallowSeedpods.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ChineseTallowSeedpods.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSeed pods\n\nThe waxy green leaves set off the clusters of greenish-yellow and white\n[flowers](/wiki/Flower \"Flower\") at bloom time. The flowers occur in terminal\nspike-like [inflorescences](/wiki/Inflorescence \"Inflorescence\") up to 20 cm\nlong. Light green in color, these flowers are very conspicuous in the spring.\nEach pistillate (female) flower is solitary and has a three-lobed ovary, three\nstyles, and no petals. They are located on short branches at the base of the\nspike. The staminate (male) flowers occur in clusters at the upper nodes of\nthe inflorescence.\n\nFruits are three-lobed, three-valved capsules. As the capsules mature, their\ncolor changes from green to a brown-black. The capsule walls fall away and\nrelease three globose seeds with a white, tallow-containing covering. Seeds\nusually hang on the plants for several weeks. In [North\nAmerica](/wiki/North_America \"North America\"), the flowers typically mature\nfrom April to June and the fruit ripens from September to October.\n\n## Range and\nhabitat[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triadica_sebifera&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Range and habitat\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Triadica_sebifera_in_the_USA.svg/180px-\nTriadica_sebifera_in_the_USA.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Triadica_sebifera_in_the_USA.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Triadica_sebifera_in_the_USA.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRange in the United States\n\nAlthough native to China and Japan, the plant is also found where it has been\nintroduced in the southeastern [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United\nStates\"), [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto Rico\"), [Costa\nRica](/wiki/Costa_Rica \"Costa Rica\"), [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\"),\n[India](/wiki/India \"India\"), [Martinique](/wiki/Martinique \"Martinique\"),\n[Sudan](/wiki/Sudan \"Sudan\"), and southern [France](/wiki/France \"France\").[6]\nIncorrectly thought to have been introduced in colonial times by Benjamin\nFranklin, the tree has become [naturalized](/wiki/Naturalisation_\\(biology\\)\n\"Naturalisation \\(biology\\)\") from [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina\n\"North Carolina\") southward along the [Atlantic](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean\n\"Atlantic Ocean\") and the entire [Gulf coast](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of\nMexico\"), where it grows profusely along ditchbanks and\n[dikes](/wiki/Dike_\\(construction\\) \"Dike \\(construction\\)\"). It grows\nespecially well in open fields and abandoned farmland coastal prairie regions\nfeaturing disturbed ground—such as abandoned farmland, spoil banks, roadsides,\nand storm-damaged forests—and along the edges of the [Western Gulf coastal\ngrasslands](/wiki/Western_Gulf_coastal_grasslands \"Western Gulf coastal\ngrasslands\") biome, sometimes forming [pure stands](/wiki/Monoculture\n\"Monoculture\").[7] In the [Houston area](/wiki/Greater_Houston \"Greater\nHouston\"), Chinese tallow trees account for a full 23 percent of all trees,\nmore than any other tree species and is the only invasive tree species in the\n14 most common species in the area.[8] The Texas Department of Agriculture\nlists Chinese Tallow as one of the 24 most invasive plants, and includes\nChinese Tallow in a list of Noxious and Invasive Plants which are illegal to\nsell, distribute or import into Texas.[9][10] Herbivores and insects have a\nconditioned behavioral avoidance to eating the leaves of Chinese tallow tree,\nand this, rather than plant toxins, may be a reason for the success of the\nplant as an invasive.[11]\n\nThe plant is sold in [nurseries](/wiki/Nursery_\\(horticulture\\) \"Nursery\n\\(horticulture\\)\") as an [ornamental](/wiki/Ornamental_plant \"Ornamental\nplant\") tree. It is not choosy about [soil](/wiki/Soil \"Soil\") types or\n[drainage](/wiki/Drainage \"Drainage\"), but will not grow in deep shade. It\ncommonly grows all over Japan, and is reasonably hardy. It is prized for its\nabundant and often spectacular autumn foliage.\n\nThe tree is common in southeast Oklahoma as well, although it is not depicted\non the map.\n\n## Uses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triadica_sebifera&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Uses\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/DeerNaraJapan.jpg/250px-\nDeerNaraJapan.jpg)](/wiki/File:DeerNaraJapan.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:DeerNaraJapan.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_**Sapium**_ _**sebiferum**_ in autumn, Japan\n\nThe seed's white waxy aril is used in soap making. The seed's inner oil is\ntoxic but has industrial applications.\n\nThe nectar is non-toxic, and it has become a major [honey\nplant](/wiki/Honey_plant \"Honey plant\") for [beekeepers](/wiki/Beekeeper\n\"Beekeeper\"). The honey is of high quality, and is produced copiously during\nthe month of June, on the Gulf Coast. In the Gulf coast states, beekeepers\nmigrate with their [honey bees](/wiki/Honey_bee \"Honey bee\") to good tallow\nlocations near the sea.\n\nThe tree is highly ornamental, fast growing and a good shade tree. It is\nespecially noteworthy if grown in areas that have strong seasonal temperature\nranges with the leaves becoming a multitude of colours rivaling maples in the\nautumn.\n\nThe tree grows well in urban areas, and is very good for \"sidewalk holes\"\nalong busy roads with a lot of traffic where most trees will not grow well. It\ncan provide shade to counter the heat island effect of mainly-concrete areas,\nas well as habitat for urban animals such as lizards and birds.\n\n## Invasive\nspecies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triadica_sebifera&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Invasive species\")]\n\nAs aforementioned, the tallow tree is a [non-native\nspecies](/wiki/Introduced_species \"Introduced species\") to many places around\nthe world. Its introduced status in North America along with the harm it\ncauses to ecosystems makes the tree considered an [invasive\nspecies](/wiki/Invasive_species \"Invasive species\") there. Tallow trees\npresent a danger of expansion that can hurt local ecosystems by out-competing\nnative vegetation and creating a [monoculture](/wiki/Monoculture\n\"Monoculture\"). The monoculture would then lower the species diversity and\noverall resilience of the area.[12] The tree’s tenacious nature, high growth\nrates, and high reproductive ability contribute to its invasive success.\nAccording to the [U.S. Department of\nAgriculture](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture \"United States\nDepartment of Agriculture\"), tallow trees begin producing viable seed in as\nsoon as three years.[12] They can spread by [root sprouts](/wiki/Basal_shoot\n\"Basal shoot\") and cuttings and are quick to invade after a disturbance occurs\nin an area, due to the clearing out of land.[6] A single tallow tree can\nproduce nearly 100,000 viable seeds annually that can remain in the soil for\nseveral years before sprouting. A mature [stand](/wiki/Stand_level_modelling\n\"Stand level modelling\") can produce 4,500 kilograms of seeds per hectare per\nyear.[12] These seeds are easily carried to different places by birds and\nwater. Tallow trees can remain productive for 100 years.[12] It is also\nextremely hard to kill—its poisonous features in its leaves and berries leave\nit with few to no predators, and its short generation time means even freshly\ncut trees can quickly regrow.[6] Currently, [herbicides](/wiki/Herbicides\n\"Herbicides\") and [prescribed fire](/wiki/Controlled_burn \"Controlled burn\")\nare the only effective treatments available to contain and control Chinese\ntallow.[6] The USDA is evaluating the flea beetle (_Bikasha collaris_) as a\nnatural control agent.[13]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triadica_sebifera&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"_Triadica sebifera_ \"](https://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=TRSE6).
