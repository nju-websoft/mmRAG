The club was formed in [Newton Heath](/wiki/Newton_Heath \"Newton\nHeath\") in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR F.C., and played their first competitive\nmatch in October 1886, when they entered the First Round of the [1886–87 FA\nCup](/wiki/1886%E2%80%9387_FA_Cup \"1886–87 FA Cup\"). The club was renamed\nManchester United F.C. in 1902, and moved to [Old Trafford](/wiki/Old_Trafford\n\"Old Trafford\") in 1910.\n\nFrom the beginning of the club's official managerial records in 1892 to the\nstart of the [2017–18\nseason](/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_Manchester_United_F.C._season \"2017–18\nManchester United F.C. season\"), [Manchester\nUnited](/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C. \"Manchester United F.C.\") have had 22\nfull-time managers. The current manager is [José\nMourinho](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho \"José Mourinho\") who took over from [Louis\nvan Gaal](/wiki/Louis_van_Gaal \"Louis van Gaal\") on 27 May 2016.\n\nThe longest-serving and most successful person to manage Manchester United is\n[Sir Alex Ferguson](/wiki/Alex_Ferguson \"Alex Ferguson\"), who won 13 [Premier\nLeague](/wiki/Premier_League \"Premier League\") titles, five [FA\nCups](/wiki/FA_Cup \"FA Cup\"), four [League Cups](/wiki/Football_League_Cup\n\"Football League Cup\"), 10 [Community Shields](/wiki/FA_Community_Shield \"FA\nCommunity Shield\"), two [UEFA Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League\n\"UEFA Champions League\") titles, one [UEFA Cup Winners'\nCup](/wiki/UEFA_Cup_Winners%27_Cup \"UEFA Cup Winners' Cup\"), one [UEFA Super\nCup](/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup \"UEFA Super Cup\"), one [Intercontinental\nCup](/wiki/Intercontinental_Cup_\\(football\\) \"Intercontinental Cup\n\\(football\\)\") and one [FIFA Club World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup \"FIFA\nClub World Cup\") in his managerial reign of more than 26 years.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Managerial history\n  * 2 Statistics\n  * 3 Notes\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Managerial\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Manchester_United_F.C._managers&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Managerial history\")]\n\nFrom 1878 to 1914, the team was selected by a committee whose secretary had\nthe same powers and role as a manager has today. There were four secretaries\nduring this period, [A. H. Albut](/wiki/A._H._Albut \"A. H. Albut\"), [James\nWest](/wiki/James_West_\\(football_manager\\) \"James West \\(football\nmanager\\)\"), [Ernest Mangnall](/wiki/Ernest_Mangnall \"Ernest Mangnall\") and\n[John Bentley](/wiki/John_Bentley_\\(football_manager\\) \"John Bentley\n\\(football manager\\)\").\n\nErnest Mangnall was the first man to bring any major silverware to the club,\nwinning the club's first ever [Football League](/wiki/The_Football_League \"The\nFootball League\") title in 1908. This was followed by the [FA\nCup](/wiki/FA_Cup \"FA Cup\") the following season, and another league title in\n1911. Despite this success, though, he left the club a year later to join\nlocal rivals [Manchester City](/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C. \"Manchester City\nF.C.\"). Coincidentally, Mangnall's last match in charge of United was the Old\nTrafford derby of 7 September 1912.[1] John Bentley took over as club\nsecretary, but was replaced two years later by [Jack Robson](/wiki/Jack_Robson\n\"Jack Robson\"), who became the club's first full-time manager. He remained in\nthe post for seven years, but resigned in December 1921 after succumbing to a\nbout of pneumonia.[2]\n\nRobson was followed soon after by [John\nChapman](/wiki/John_Chapman_\\(football_manager\\) \"John Chapman \\(football\nmanager\\)\"). However, in Chapman's first season at the club, they were\nrelegated to the [Second Division](/wiki/Football_League_Second_Division\n\"Football League Second Division\") for the first time since 1906. Three years\nin the Second Division followed, before promotion back to the [First\nDivision](/wiki/Football_League_First_Division \"Football League First\nDivision\"). After guiding the club to 9th place in the league and the FA Cup\nsemi-finals in [1925–26](/wiki/1925%E2%80%9326_Manchester_United_F.C._season\n\"1925–26 Manchester United F.C. season\"), Chapman received a\n[telegram](/wiki/Telegraphy \"Telegraphy\") from [the Football\nAssociation](/wiki/The_Football_Association \"The Football Association\") on 8\nOctober 1926 informing him of his suspension from management for the rest of\nthe season; no reason was given. Half-back [Lal Hilditch](/wiki/Lal_Hilditch\n\"Lal Hilditch\") took over for the remainder of the season, before [Herbert\nBamlett](/wiki/Herbert_Bamlett \"Herbert Bamlett\") took permanent control.\n\nBamlett was manager for four years, but was unable to muster any success, the\nclub's highest position during his reign being 12th.[3] The club was relegated\nto the Second Division again in 1931, and Bamlett was replaced by club\nsecretary [Walter Crickmer](/wiki/Walter_Crickmer \"Walter Crickmer\"). This was\nCrickmer's first of two spells as manager of the club, retaining his position\nas secretary all the while. It lasted only a season, though, as he failed to\nreturn the club to the First Division. In June 1932, [Scott\nDuncan](/wiki/Scott_Duncan_\\(footballer\\) \"Scott Duncan \\(footballer\\)\") was\nappointed as manager, but in his second season in charge he led the club to\nwhat remains a club record lowest League position; 20th in the Second\nDivision. The club held faith in Duncan though, and he managed to get the club\nback into the First Division by 1936. However, the club was relegated again\nthe following year, and Walter Crickmer resumed control until the end of the\n[Second World War](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\").\n\nBefore the end of the war, the club approached [Matt Busby](/wiki/Matt_Busby\n\"Matt Busby\"), who had just turned down the opportunity to join the coaching\nstaff at [Liverpool](/wiki/Liverpool_F.C. \"Liverpool F.C.\"), on the grounds\nthat he wanted more responsibility over the playing side of the club than\nmerely the selection of the team.[3] United allowed Busby the responsibilities\nhe requested, and in his first five seasons in charge he guided the team to\nfour second-place finishes in the league, before finally winning his first\ntitle in 1952. He soon set about replacing many of the more experienced\nplayers with a group of youths who came to be known as the \"[Busby\nBabes](/wiki/Busby_Babes \"Busby Babes\")\". This team went on to win two league\ntitles in [1955–56](/wiki/1955%E2%80%9356_Manchester_United_F.C._season\n\"1955–56 Manchester United F.C. season\") and\n[1956–57](/wiki/1956%E2%80%9357_Manchester_United_F.C._season \"1956–57\nManchester United F.C. season\"), as well as reaching two FA Cup finals.\nUnfortunately, the careers of many of the players were cut short by the\n[Munich air disaster](/wiki/Munich_air_disaster \"Munich air disaster\"), which\nalso left Busby fighting for his life.[4]\n\nWhile Busby was in hospital recovering from the injuries he sustained in the\nair crash, his managerial duties were left to his assistant, [Jimmy\nMurphy](/wiki/Jimmy_Murphy_\\(footballer\\) \"Jimmy Murphy \\(footballer\\)\").\nAfter Busby recovered, he set about rebuilding his side, and within five\nyears, in [1963](/wiki/1963_FA_Cup_Final \"1963 FA Cup Final\"), he had won the\nFA Cup for the first time in 15 years. This was followed up by two league\ntitles in three years, and then the greatest prize in European club football,\nthe [European Cup](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League \"UEFA Champions League\"). He\ncontinued as manager for one more year after this success, leaving his\nmanagerial duties to club trainer [Wilf McGuinness](/wiki/Wilf_McGuinness\n\"Wilf McGuinness\"). McGuinness struggled in his new post, however, and Busby\nwas convinced to return for the second half of the [1970–71\nseason](/wiki/1970%E2%80%9371_Manchester_United_F.C._season \"1970–71\nManchester United F.C. season\").[4] However, he retired from football\npermanently that summer, and was succeeded that summer by [Frank\nO'Farrell](/wiki/Frank_O%27Farrell \"Frank O'Farrell\"). O'Farrell's stay was\nshort-lived, though, as his inability to control [George\nBest](/wiki/George_Best \"George Best\")'s extravagances forced the board to\nsack him with three years still to run on his contract.\n\nO'Farrell's replacement was to be\n[Scotland](/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team \"Scotland national football\nteam\") coach, [Tommy Docherty](/wiki/Tommy_Docherty \"Tommy Docherty\").\nDocherty left the Scotland job and his first task at United was to keep the\nclub in the top flight. He managed it once, but he was unable to pull it off\nagain and the club was relegated in\n[1973–74](/wiki/1973%E2%80%9374_Manchester_United_F.C._season \"1973–74\nManchester United F.C. season\"). They bounced straight back up the following\nseason, though, and in their first season back in the top flight, the team\ncruised to a third-place finish and yet another [FA Cup\nfinal](/wiki/1976_FA_Cup_Final \"1976 FA Cup Final\"). The next year, they went\none better, beating Liverpool in the [final](/wiki/1977_FA_Cup_Final \"1977 FA\nCup Final\") to claim his first and only trophy at [Old\nTrafford](/wiki/Old_Trafford \"Old Trafford\"). It was soon discovered, however,\nthat Docherty was having an affair with the wife of the club's\nphysiotherapist, and he was immediately fired,[5] replaced by [Queens Park\nRangers](/wiki/Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C. \"Queens Park Rangers F.C.\")' manager\n[Dave Sexton](/wiki/Dave_Sexton \"Dave Sexton\").\n\nSexton remained in the United job for four years, but was unable to produce\nany silverware, and was replaced in 1981 by [Ron Atkinson](/wiki/Ron_Atkinson\n\"Ron Atkinson\"). Atkinson was able to rekindle the club's cup success, leading\nhis side to two FA Cups in his five-year tenure. He also oversaw a series of\nrespectable finishes in the league, but after his disastrous start to the\n[1986–87 season](/wiki/1986%E2%80%9387_Manchester_United_F.C._season \"1986–87\nManchester United F.C. season\"), he was sacked.[6] His replacement, Alex\nFerguson, had, in recent years, become the first manager to break the\ndominance of [Rangers](/wiki/Rangers_F.C. \"Rangers F.C.\") and\n[Celtic](/wiki/Celtic_F.C. \"Celtic F.C.\") in the Scottish league for over 15\nyears, winning the Scottish Premier Division title with\n[Aberdeen](/wiki/Aberdeen_F.C. \"Aberdeen F.C.\") three times in six years, as\nwell as finishing as runner-up twice and winning the European Cup-Winners Cup.\n\nDuring his tenure, Ferguson was credited with the distinction of making some\nof the most shrewd purchases in the club's history, including the signings of\n[Peter Schmeichel](/wiki/Peter_Schmeichel \"Peter Schmeichel\") and [Eric\nCantona](/wiki/Eric_Cantona \"Eric Cantona\"), each for less than £1.5\nmillion.[7] With these signings, combined with the club's many experienced\nplayers, Ferguson brought the league title back to Old Trafford for the first\ntime in 26 years. In the following decade, he won the Premier League title\nanother six times, including a hat-trick of titles from 1999 to 2001, a feat\nthat no other manager has yet achieved with the same club.[8] In 1999, he also\nled the club to an unprecedented Treble of [Premier\nLeague](/wiki/1998%E2%80%9399_FA_Premier_League \"1998–99 FA Premier League\"),\n[FA Cup](/wiki/1999_FA_Cup_Final \"1999 FA Cup Final\") and [UEFA Champions\nLeague](/wiki/1999_UEFA_Champions_League_Final \"1999 UEFA Champions League\nFinal\"). Subsequently, he added another three league titles to his trophy\nhaul, despite a number of promises of retirement.[9] Ferguson won his 10th\nPremier League title in the [2007–08\nseason](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_Premier_League \"2007–08 Premier League\"), and\nfollowed this up with his second Champions League title 10 days later. In\n[2008–09](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Premier_League \"2008–09 Premier League\"),\nFerguson guided United to another Premier League title, making Manchester\nUnited the only club and him the only manager to have won the English league\ntitle three times in a row twice. His 12th title, in the\n[2010–11](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Premier_League \"2010–11 Premier League\")\nseason, was United's 19th overall, overtaking [Liverpool](/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.\n\"Liverpool F.C.\")'s record of 18. Ferguson won his 13th and final league title\nin the [2012–13](/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Premier_League \"2012–13 Premier\nLeague\") season, making 20 titles overall for United. At the end of the\nseason, Ferguson announced his retirement, and he was replaced by\n[Everton](/wiki/Everton_F.C. \"Everton F.C.\") manager [David\nMoyes](/wiki/David_Moyes \"David Moyes\").[10]\n\nIn his first match, Moyes gave United their 20th Community Shield and his\nfirst trophy as United manager; however, after failing to lead the club to\nChampions League qualification, he was sacked before the end of his first\nseason, with [Ryan Giggs](/wiki/Ryan_Giggs \"Ryan Giggs\") taking temporary\ncharge for the final four games of the 2013–14 season where the club finished\nseventh, their lowest league finish since the establishment of the Premier\nLeague.[11] [Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team\n\"Netherlands national football team\") manager [Louis van\nGaal](/wiki/Louis_van_Gaal \"Louis van Gaal\") was appointed as Moyes' permanent\nreplacement on 19 May 2014, taking charge after the end of the [2014 FIFA\nWorld Cup](/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup \"2014 FIFA World Cup\").[12] In his\ninaugural season, United signed many prominent players and returned to the\nChampions League with a 4th-place finish. In his second season, United\nfinished in 5th place behind [Manchester City](/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.\n\"Manchester City F.C.\"), out of Champions League position, but won the [2016\nFA Cup](/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_FA_Cup \"2015–16 FA Cup\"), the club's first in a\ndozen years. The board, however, decided that not enough progress had been\nmade from the previous season and Van Gaal was sacked on 23 May 2016, just\ndays after lifting the cup. He was replaced by two-time European champion and\nformer [Chelsea](/wiki/Chelsea_F.C. \"Chelsea F.C.\") boss [José\nMourinho](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho \"José Mourinho\") on 27 May 2016.
