It\nis the largest [library](/wiki/Library \"Library\") in [Ireland](/wiki/Ireland\n\"Ireland\") and, as a [legal deposit](/wiki/Legal_deposit \"Legal deposit\") or\n\"copyright library\", it has rights to receive material published in the\n[Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\") free of\ncharge; it is also the only Irish library to hold such rights for the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"). The Library is the permanent\nhome to the famous [Book of Kells](/wiki/Book_of_Kells \"Book of Kells\").

A huge building, it originally towered over the university and city after its completion. Even today, surrounded by similarly scaled buildings, it is imposing and dominates the view of the university from Nassau Street. The Book of Kells is located in the Old Library, along with the [Book of Durrow](/wiki/Book_of_Durrow \"Book of Durrow\"), the [Book of Howth](/wiki/Book_of_Howth \"Book of Howth\") and other ancient texts. Also incorporating the Long Room, the Old Library is one of Ireland's biggest tourist attractions, and holds thousands of rare, and in many cases very early, volumes. In the 18th century, the college received the [Brian Boru harp](/wiki/Trinity_College_Harp \"Trinity College Harp\"), one of the three surviving medieval Gaelic harps, and a national symbol of Ireland, which is now housed in the Library. Housed within the Old Library are: \n    * Early Printed Books and Special Collections\n    * Manuscripts & Archives Research Library (M&ARL)\n  * The Berkeley/Lecky/Ussher (BLU) Arts Libraries complex, incorporating: \n    * The [Berkeley](/wiki/Bishop_Berkeley \"Bishop Berkeley\") Library, in Fellows Square\n    * The [Lecky](/wiki/William_Edward_Hartpole_Lecky \"William Edward Hartpole Lecky\") Library, attached to the Arts Building\n    * The [Ussher](/wiki/James_Ussher \"James Ussher\") Library, overlooking [College Park](/wiki/College_Park,_Dublin \"College Park, Dublin\")\n    * The Glucksman Map Library\n    * The Preservation and Conservation Department\n  * The [Hamilton](/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton \"William Rowan Hamilton\") Science and Engineering Library\n  * The 1937 Reading Room (for graduate use)\n  * The [John Stearne](/wiki/John_Stearne_\\(physician\\) \"John Stearne \\(physician\\)\") Medical Library (JSML), housed at St James's Hospital\n\nFurther materials are held in storage in Stacks, either in closed access\nwithin College or at a book depository in the Dublin suburb of\n[Santry](/wiki/Santry \"Santry\").\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College_Library&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe Library began with the founding of Trinity College in 1592. In 1661,\n[Henry Jones](/wiki/Henry_Jones_\\(bishop\\) \"Henry Jones \\(bishop\\)\") presented\nit with the Book of Kells, its most famous manuscript. [James\nUssher](/wiki/James_Ussher \"James Ussher\") (1625–56), Archbishop of Armagh,\nwhose most important works were _\" Veterum Epistolarum Hibernicarum Sylloge\"_\n(1632) and _\" Brittanicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates\"_ (1639), left his\nvaluable library, comprising several thousand printed books and manuscripts,\nto the Library. His complete works were published by the Library in twenty-\nfour volumes.[3]\n\nIn 1801, the Library was given [legal deposit](/wiki/Legal_deposit \"Legal\ndeposit\") rights, making it the only library in Ireland to have such rights\nfor the United Kingdom at that time.[3] Starting at 4 pm on Saturday 29\nNovember 2009, the Trinity Students' Union organized a 24-hour sit-in in\nprotest at a reduced book-buying budget, lack of access to books on Sundays,\nand a proposed reduction of counter services.[4]\n\n## Legal deposit library\nstatus[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College_Library&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Legal deposit library status\")]\n\nAccording to the [Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of\nIreland\")'s Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, the Library is entitled,\nalong with the [National Library of Ireland](/wiki/National_Library_of_Ireland\n\"National Library of Ireland\") and the libraries of the [National University\nof Ireland](/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland \"National University of\nIreland\"), the [University of Limerick](/wiki/University_of_Limerick\n\"University of Limerick\"), and [Dublin City\nUniversity](/wiki/Dublin_City_University \"Dublin City University\"), to receive\na copy of all works published in the Republic of Ireland. Also, as a result of\nthe [British](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") [Legal Deposit Libraries\nAct 2003](/wiki/Legal_Deposit_Libraries_Act_2003 \"Legal Deposit Libraries Act\n2003\"), which continues a more ancient right dating from 1801, the Library is\nentitled, along with the [British Library](/wiki/British_Library \"British\nLibrary\"), the [Bodleian Library](/wiki/Bodleian_Library \"Bodleian Library\")\nat [Oxford](/wiki/Oxford \"Oxford\"), [Cambridge University\nLibrary](/wiki/Cambridge_University_Library \"Cambridge University Library\"),\nthe [National Library of Wales](/wiki/National_Library_of_Wales \"National\nLibrary of Wales\") and the [National Library of\nScotland](/wiki/National_Library_of_Scotland \"National Library of Scotland\"),\nto receive a copy on request of all works published in the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\").\n\n## The Long\nRoom[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College_Library&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: The Long Room\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/County_Dublin_-\n_Long_Room-Trinity_College_-_20180703092642.jpg/220px-County_Dublin_-\n_Long_Room-Trinity_College_-_20180703092642.jpg)](/wiki/File:County_Dublin_-\n_Long_Room-Trinity_College_-_20180703092642.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:County_Dublin_-_Long_Room-Trinity_College_-_20180703092642.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nDetail of Long Room shelving\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/James_Malton_Trinity_College_Library_Dublin.jpg/220px-\nJames_Malton_Trinity_College_Library_Dublin.jpg)](/wiki/File:James_Malton_Trinity_College_Library_Dublin.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:James_Malton_Trinity_College_Library_Dublin.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWatercolour of Long Room before the roof was raised\n\nThe 65-metre-long (213 ft) main chamber of the Old Library, the Long Room, was\nbuilt between 1712 and 1732 and houses 200,000 of the Library's oldest books.\nInitially The Long Room had a flat ceiling, shelving for books only on the\nlower level, and an open gallery. By the 1850s the room had to be expanded as\nthe shelves were filled due to the fact that the Library had been given\npermission to obtain a free copy of every book that had been published in\n[Ireland and Britain](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland\n\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\"). In 1860, The Long Room's roof\nwas raised to accommodate an upper gallery.[5] The Long Room is lined with\nmarble busts. The marble bust collection was formed when 14 busts from the\nfamous sculptor [Peter Scheemakers](/wiki/Peter_Scheemakers \"Peter\nScheemakers\") were acquired by the college. Many of the busts are of great\nphilosophers, writers, and men who supported the college. The most outstanding\nbust in the collection is of the writer [Jonathan Swift](/wiki/Jonathan_Swift\n\"Jonathan Swift\"), created by [Louis François\nRoubiliac](/wiki/Louis_Fran%C3%A7ois_Roubiliac \"Louis François Roubiliac\").[5]\n\nThe Long Room also holds one of the last remaining copies of the 1916\n[Proclamation of the Irish Republic](/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_Irish_Republic\n\"Proclamation of the Irish Republic\"). This proclamation was read by [Patrick\nPearse](/wiki/Patrick_Pearse \"Patrick Pearse\") near the General Post Office on\n24 April 1916. Visitors may also view the [Trinity College\nharp](/wiki/Trinity_College_harp \"Trinity College harp\") (also known as the\n\"[Brian Boru harp](/wiki/Brian_Boru_harp \"Brian Boru harp\")\") in The Long Room\nthat is the oldest of its kind in Ireland dating back to the 15th century. The\nharp is made out of oak and willow and includes 29 brass strings.[5]\n\n### In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College_Library&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: In popular culture\")]\n\nThe [Jedi](/wiki/Jedi \"Jedi\") archives of the Jedi Temple in the movie _[Star\nWars: Episode II – Attack of the\nClones](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_II_%E2%80%93_Attack_of_the_Clones \"Star Wars:\nEpisode II – Attack of the Clones\")_ bear a startling resemblance to the Long\nRoom of the Trinity College Library. This resemblance resulted in controversy\nas permission had not been sought to use the building's likeness in the film.\nHowever, [Lucasfilm](/wiki/Lucasfilm \"Lucasfilm\") denied that the Long Room\nwas the basis for the Jedi archives, and officials from Trinity College\nLibrary decided not to take any legal action.[6][7]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College_Library&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Category:Librarians of Trinity College, Dublin](/wiki/Category:Librarians_of_Trinity_College,_Dublin \"Category:Librarians of Trinity College, Dublin\")\n  * [Books in the United Kingdom](/wiki/Books_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Books in the United Kingdom\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College_Library&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** \"University and College Officers - University and Professors, Associate Professors, Lecturers and other Officers\".
