The Sunday edition was canceled in 1999;\nweekend editions returned on both Saturdays and Sundays on September 4, 2004.\nThe weekday program airs from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. in all [U.S. time\nzones](/wiki/Time_in_the_United_States \"Time in the United States\") (live in\nthe [Eastern Time Zone](/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone \"Eastern Time Zone\") and on\n[tape delay](/wiki/Broadcast_delay \"Broadcast delay\") elsewhere across the\ncountry).

Viewers in the [Pacific Time Zone](/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone\n\"Pacific Time Zone\") receive an updated feed with a specialized opening and\nupdated live reports. A third hour of the weekday broadcast aired from 2007 to\n2008, exclusively on [ABC News Now](/wiki/ABC_News_Now \"ABC News Now\").\n\nThe program features news, interviews, weather forecasts, special-interest\nstories, and feature segments such as \"Pop News\" (featuring [pop\nculture](/wiki/Popular_culture \"Popular culture\") and entertainment news, and\n[viral videos](/wiki/Viral_video \"Viral video\")), the \"GMA Heat Index\"\n(featuring a mix of entertainment, lifestyle and human-interest stories) and\n\"Play of the Day\" (featuring a selected viral video or television program\nclip).

The program was hosted by [Bill\nBeutel](/wiki/Bill_Beutel \"Bill Beutel\") and [Stephanie\nEdwards](/wiki/Stephanie_Edwards_\\(TV_personality\\) \"Stephanie Edwards \\(TV\npersonality\\)\"),[4] with [Peter Jennings](/wiki/Peter_Jennings \"Peter\nJennings\") and Robert Kennedy reading the news. Because the show could not\nfind an audience against _Today_ (and its anchor team of [Jim\nHartz](/wiki/Jim_Hartz \"Jim Hartz\") and [Barbara\nWalters](/wiki/Barbara_Walters \"Barbara Walters\")), ABC sought a new approach.\nThe network found that one of its affiliates, [WEWS](/wiki/WEWS \"WEWS\") in\n[Cleveland](/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio \"Cleveland, Ohio\"), [Ohio](/wiki/Ohio\n\"Ohio\"), had been pre-empting _AM America_ in favor of airing a locally\nproduced show called _[The Morning Exchange](/wiki/The_Morning_Exchange \"The\nMorning Exchange\")_.\n\nUnlike _AM America_ and _Today_ , _The Morning Exchange_ featured an easygoing\nand less dramatic approach by offering news and weather updates only at the\n[top and bottom of every hour](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/top_of_the_hour\n\"wikt:top of the hour\") and used the rest of the time to discuss general-\ninterest/entertainment topics. _The Morning Exchange_ also established a group\nof regular guests who were experts in certain fields, including health,\nentertainment, consumer affairs and travel. Also unlike both the NBC and ABC\nshows, _The Morning Exchange_ was not broadcast from a newsroom set but\ninstead one that resembled a [suburban](/wiki/Suburban \"Suburban\") [living\nroom](/wiki/Living_room \"Living room\").\n\nIn the process of screening the Cleveland morning program as a creative\nsource, ABC also began looking at another local show, _[Good\nMorning!](/wiki/Good_Day!_\\(TV_series\\) \"Good Day! \\(TV series\\)\")_ , which\nwas produced by [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\") ABC affiliate [WCVB-\nTV](/wiki/WCVB-TV \"WCVB-TV\"). _Good Morning!_ was very similar in format to\n_The Morning Exchange_ , but with a lesser emphasis on news and weather. In\nfact, once the revamped ABC morning show took to the air late in 1975 under\nthe title _Good Morning America_ , WCVB station manager Bob Bennett accused\nABC entertainment president [Fred Silverman](/wiki/Fred_Silverman \"Fred\nSilverman\") of deliberately stealing the title of _Good Morning!_ ; no legal\n[cease and desist](/wiki/Cease_and_desist \"Cease and desist\") action was\nfinalized against ABC in the matter, however. The launch of _Good Morning\nAmerica_ did result in the Boston morning show changing its name—to _Good\nDay!_.\n\nABC took an episode of _The Morning Exchange_ and used it as a [pilot\nepisode](/wiki/Television_pilot \"Television pilot\"). After very positive\nreviews for the pilot[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_], the format replaced _AM America_ in November\n1975 as _Good Morning America_. The first host of the new program was [David\nHartman](/wiki/David_Hartman_\\(TV_personality\\) \"David Hartman \\(TV\npersonality\\)\"), featuring [Nancy Dussault](/wiki/Nancy_Dussault \"Nancy\nDussault\") as his co-host. Dussault was replaced in 1977 by [Sandy\nHill](/wiki/Sandra_%22Sandy%22_Hill \"Sandra \"Sandy\" Hill\").[5] For the first\nseven years, weather forecasts were presented by [John\nColeman](/wiki/John_Coleman_\\(meteorologist\\) \"John Coleman\n\\(meteorologist\\)\"), former chief meteorologist for ABC [owned-and-operated\nstation](/wiki/Owned-and-operated_station \"Owned-and-operated station\") [WLS-\nTV](/wiki/WLS-TV \"WLS-TV\") in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\"), who would\nleave _GMA_ in 1982 to start [The Weather Channel](/wiki/The_Weather_Channel\n\"The Weather Channel\") with [Landmark\nCommunications](/wiki/Landmark_Media_Enterprises \"Landmark Media Enterprises\")\nCEO [Frank Batten](/wiki/Frank_Batten \"Frank Batten\"). Dave Murray (now chief\nmeteorologist at [KTVI](/wiki/KTVI \"KTVI\") in [St.\nLouis](/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri \"St. Louis, Missouri\")) provided the\nforecasts for both _Good Morning America_ and ABC's early morning news program\n_[ABC News This Morning](/wiki/America_This_Morning \"America This Morning\")_\nfrom 1983 to 1986. In August 1986, he was replaced by [Spencer\nChristian](/wiki/Spencer_Christian \"Spencer Christian\"), who worked at [WABC-\nTV](/wiki/WABC-TV \"WABC-TV\") in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York\nCity\") and served as fill-in meteorologist for both Coleman and Murray\nwhenever they were away on vacation or assignment.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### 1976–89: Growth and\nchange[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Good_Morning_America&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1976–89: Growth and change\")]\n\nThe program's [ratings](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings \"Nielsen ratings\") climbed\nslowly, but steadily throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s while _Today_\nexperienced a slight slump in viewership, especially with Walters' decision to\nleave NBC for a job at [ABC News](/wiki/ABC_News \"ABC News\"). On August 30,\n1976, [Tom Brokaw](/wiki/Tom_Brokaw \"Tom Brokaw\") began anchoring _Today_\nwhile the program began a search for a female co-host. Within a year, _Today_\nmanaged to beat back the _Good Morning America_ ratings threat with Brokaw and\nnew co-host [Jane Pauley](/wiki/Jane_Pauley \"Jane Pauley\"), featuring art and\nentertainment contributor [Gene Shalit](/wiki/Gene_Shalit \"Gene Shalit\").\n_Good Morning America_ continued to threaten _Today_ 's ratings dominance into\nthe 1980s, especially after Brokaw left the latter program to become co-anchor\nof _[NBC Nightly News](/wiki/NBC_Nightly_News \"NBC Nightly News\")_ with [Roger\nMudd](/wiki/Roger_Mudd \"Roger Mudd\") for 17 months before being named sole\nanchor of that program. For the first time, _Good Morning America_ became the\nhighest-rated morning news program in the United States as _Today_ fell to\nsecond place.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAt the outset, _Good Morning America_ was a talk program with a main host,\nHartman, who was joined by a sidekick co-host; Dussault and Hill were scripted\nas less-than-equal hosts. In 1980, an exasperated Hill left _Good Morning\nAmerica_ after run-ins with Hartman, who was said to have \"had a problem with\nstrong women.\" [6] She was replaced by [Joan Lunden](/wiki/Joan_Lunden \"Joan\nLunden\"), then a reporter at ABC's New York City [flagship\nstation](/wiki/Flagship_\\(broadcasting\\) \"Flagship \\(broadcasting\\)\") [WABC-\nTV](/wiki/WABC-TV \"WABC-TV\"). Hartman and Lunden led the show through several\nyears of success. Lunden's popularity led to her promotion to co-anchor in\n1986, and to more equal footing with Hartman than any woman before her.[6] The\npartnership ended on February 20, 1987, when Hartman retired after 3,189\nbroadcasts.\n\nAfter Hartman's departure, Lunden was paired with ABC News correspondent\n[Charles Gibson](/wiki/Charles_Gibson \"Charles Gibson\") on February 23, 1987,\nwhich ultimately resulted in ratings for the program skyrocketing. The team of\nLunden and Gibson became the most popular news partnership on television in\nthe late 1980s and early 1990s, and for the first time _Good Morning America_\nregularly won the ratings against _Today_. At one point prior to Spencer\nChristian's arrival in 1986, forecasts on the program were provided by [WXYZ-\nTV](/wiki/WXYZ-TV \"WXYZ-TV\") chief meteorologist [Jerry\nHodak](/wiki/Jerry_Hodak \"Jerry Hodak\") via a split screen between the WXYZ\nstudios in [Detroit](/wiki/Detroit,_Michigan \"Detroit, Michigan\") and the\n_Good Morning America_ set in New York City.\n\n### 1990–98: Rise and\ndecline[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Good_Morning_America&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 1990–98: Rise and decline\")]\n\n_Good Morning America_ entered the 1990s with continued overwhelming ratings\nsuccess. Gibson and Lunden became a hard team to beat; however, the program\nstumbled from its top spot in late 1995, falling to second place behind\n_Today_ (in what would begin a 16-year streak as the top-rated morning news\nprogram for that show, which began the week of December 11, 1995[7]). Lunden\nbegan to discuss working less and mentioned to network executives that the\nmorning schedule is the hardest in the business. ABC executives promised\nLunden that a [prime time](/wiki/Prime_time \"Prime time\") program; _[Behind\nClosed Doors](/wiki/Behind_Closed_Doors_\\(1996_TV_series\\) \"Behind Closed\nDoors \\(1996 TV series\\)\")_ would premiere on the network in 1996.\n\nOn September 5, 1997, Lunden decided to step down as host of _Good Morning\nAmerica_ after 17 years and was replaced by ABC News correspondent [Lisa\nMcRee](/wiki/Lisa_McRee \"Lisa McRee\"). The pairing of Gibson and McRee fared\nwell in the ratings. However, ratings sharply declined when Gibson also left\nthe show to make way for [Kevin Newman](/wiki/Kevin_Newman_\\(journalist\\)\n\"Kevin Newman \\(journalist\\)\") on May 1, 1998. With McRee and Newman as\nanchors, longtime viewers of _Good Morning America_ switched to _Today_ ,\nwhose ratings skyrocketed.\n\n### January 1999–May 2005:\nGibson–Sawyer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Good_Morning_America&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: January 1999–May 2005: Gibson–Sawyer\")]\n\nTo improve _Good Morning America_ 's ratings performance, which briefly fell\nto third place among the morning shows in January 1999, ABC News management\nselected Shelley Ross from the field of [executive\nproducer](/wiki/Executive_producer \"Executive producer\") candidates. As part\nof Rossʼs proposed changes, Ross ousted the McRee-Newman team and lobbied to\nbring in [Diane Sawyer](/wiki/Diane_Sawyer \"Diane Sawyer\") and team her with\nCharles Gibson, who had been reluctant to return. On January 18, 1999, the\nGibson-Sawyer team paired by Ross debuted on-air, which during the first full\nseason resulted in a dramatic increase in viewership while all other network\nnews franchises saw losses.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Good_Morning_America_logo_2002.jpg/220px-\nGood_Morning_America_logo_2002.jpg)](/wiki/File:Good_Morning_America_logo_2002.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Good_Morning_America_logo_2002.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n2002–2006 logo\n\nThe show moved from the ABC News headquarters in [Manhattan](/wiki/Manhattan\n\"Manhattan\")'s [Lincoln Square](/wiki/Lincoln_Square,_New_York \"Lincoln\nSquare, New York\") district to its present home at the Times Square Studios on\nSeptember 13, 1999. The new location made it possible for the program to\nfeature a live audience inside the studio, similar to the \"Window on the\nWorld\" set used by _Today_.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Under Ross, _Good Morning America_ became a\ncompetitive 24/7 news operation with more exclusive bookings, news and live\n[stock market](/wiki/Stock_market \"Stock market\") updates for West Coast\nviewers and new on-screen graphics that included a [news\nticker](/wiki/News_ticker \"News ticker\"). _Good Morning America_ began\noriginating entire shows from unique locations, which, according to [Nielsen\nMedia Research](/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research \"Nielsen Media Research\"),\nresulted in more people watching the program and for longer periods of time.\n_GMA_ became the first to originate a live show from an [aircraft\ncarrier](/wiki/Aircraft_carrier \"Aircraft carrier\") during wartime (the\n[U.S.S. Enterprise](/wiki/USS_Enterprise_\\(CVN-65\\) \"USS Enterprise\n\\(CVN-65\\)\")), from [The White House](/wiki/The_White_House \"The White House\")\n(after the [Columbine shootings](/wiki/Columbine_High_School_shootings\n\"Columbine High School shootings\")), from [The Pentagon](/wiki/The_Pentagon\n\"The Pentagon\") (for the reopening of the wing damaged during the [September\n11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks \"September 11 attacks\") in 2001), from\n[The Vatican](/wiki/Vatican_City \"Vatican City\") (for the 25th anniversary of\n[John Paul II](/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II \"Pope John Paul II\")'s election as\nPope), and from the [Tower of London](/wiki/Tower_of_London \"Tower of London\")\n(on the 50th anniversary of [Queen Elizabeth](/wiki/Elizabeth_II \"Elizabeth\nII\")ʼs accession to the throne). Viewership during this time increased by\nnearly 1 million households, and revenue soared.\n\nAlthough _Today_ remained the top-rated morning news show, the Sawyer, Gibson\nand Ross team inched close, creating a viable rival. According to Linda\nMcLoof, executive director of news research at ABC News from 2001 to 2009,\n\"When Shelley left, her viewing momentum was initially sustained, but a season\nlater, the audience began to decline. It is like passing the baton in a relay\nrace.\" [Antonio Mora](/wiki/Antonio_Mora \"Antonio Mora\") served as newsreader\nfor the program until March 18, 2002, when he left to become an anchor at\n[CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") owned-and-operated station [WBBM-TV](/wiki/WBBM-TV\n\"WBBM-TV\") in Chicago.

On November 3, 2005,\n_Good Morning America_ celebrated its 30th anniversary with retrospectives on\nand clips from the show's history and by decorating [Times\nSquare](/wiki/Times_Square \"Times Square\"). Former co-hosts Hartman and\nLunden, along with former meteorologist [Spencer\nChristian](/wiki/Spencer_Christian \"Spencer Christian\"), were among the guests\nof honor.

In August 2006, [Chris Cuomo](/wiki/Chris_Cuomo\n\"Chris Cuomo\") was named news anchor while continuing his anchoring duties on\nthe newsmagazine _[Primetime](/wiki/Primetime_\\(TV_series\\) \"Primetime \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ and serving as ABC News's senior legal correspondent. Meanwhile,\n[Sam Champion](/wiki/Sam_Champion \"Sam Champion\"), longtime evening\nmeteorologist at WABC-TV, was named as the new weather anchor for the program\nand as weather editor for ABC News. Both Cuomo and Champion began their\nrespective duties on the program on September 5, 2006, when _Good Morning\nAmerica_ instituted a new graphics package and new news area for Cuomo to\nreport headlines. The following week, on September 13, 2006, the program\nintroduced a new [logo](/wiki/Logo \"Logo\")—this time with gold Avant Garde\nfont on a blue background, which bears a resemblance to the original _Good\nMorning America_ logo that was used up to early 1987.\n\nOn June 29, 2007, the program's longtime film critic [Joel\nSiegel](/wiki/Joel_Siegel \"Joel Siegel\") died of complications from [colon\ncancer](/wiki/Colon_cancer \"Colon cancer\") at age 63. The July 9 edition of\n_GMA_ was dedicated to Siegel, with former hosts Hartman, Hill, Lunden,\nNewman, Christian, Perkins and Gibson all appearing to share their memories.\nOne month later, on July 31, 2007, Robin Roberts announced that she had been\ndiagnosed with [breast cancer](/wiki/Breast_cancer \"Breast cancer\") after\ndiscovering a lump in her breast during a self-examination while preparing the\nSiegel tribute episode. Roberts remained as anchor while undergoing\n[chemotherapy](/wiki/Chemotherapy \"Chemotherapy\") and completed radiation\ntreatments on March 28, 2008.\n\nOn October 22, 2007, _Good Morning America_ introduced a new on-air graphics\npackage. Using much of the design features of its former graphics, it went\nfrom a basic blue background to a more orangish-gold setting. The program's\nopening changed from the camera's zooming in on the hosts while introducing\nthe host to an opening with new music (by the New York City-based music\nproduction company DreamArtists Studios) and a background with the _Good\nMorning America_ logo descending onto the frame. It also changed its news\nticker and time-and-temperature bug for the first time in years. The ticker\nfeatured an orange background with a modified ABC News logo as a breakpoint\nfor each headline. The bug still featured the time and current local\ntemperature to the left, but with an orange backdrop with an alternate \"GMA\"\nlogo and the ABCNews.com logo to the right.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOn January 15, 2008, during an interview with Diane Sawyer on the program,\nactress [Diane Keaton](/wiki/Diane_Keaton \"Diane Keaton\") commented on\nSawyer's physical attractiveness, stating that if she had lips like Sawyer's,\n\"then I wouldn't have worked on my _[expletive]_ personality!\" Keaton quickly\napologized for the remark and Sawyer jokingly threatened to have her mother\n\"work on your personality with soap in your mouth.\" Officials with the\n[Federal Communications Commission](/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission\n\"Federal Communications Commission\") declined to take action for the fleeting\nexpletive.[9] Following the death of [Michael Jackson](/wiki/Michael_Jackson\n\"Michael Jackson\"), Charles Gibson returned to the _Good Morning America_\nanchor desk with Roberts on June 26, 2009, while Sawyer was away.\n\nIn September 2008, _Good Morning America_ 's anchors rode an\n[Amtrak](/wiki/Amtrak \"Amtrak\") [train](/wiki/Train \"Train\") to tour the\nUnited States as part of ABC News's \"50 States in 50 Days\" event, for which\nthe program was broadcast from different locations around the U.S. each day\nthroughout that month.

On May 3, 2010, the program debuted new\n\"light blue and sunny\" graphics, and new theme music by DreamArtists Studios.\nAn entirely new set for the program was introduced on January 31, 2011; the\nmonitor used for national weather segments (used mainly during the 7:00 a.m.\nhour only) was moved closer to the anchor desk while the news desk remained in\nthe same place. This was the first major set change since the show upgraded to\nhigh definition in November 2005.[12]\n\nOn March 17, 2011, ABC News President [Ben Sherwood](/wiki/Ben_Sherwood \"Ben\nSherwood\") announced that former _GMA_ national correspondent [Lara\nSpencer](/wiki/Lara_Spencer \"Lara Spencer\") would be rejoining the program in\na newly created lifestyle anchor position.[13] On March 29, 2011, ESPN anchor\n[Josh Elliott](/wiki/Josh_Elliott \"Josh Elliott\") was named news anchor of the\nprogram following the departure of [Juju Chang](/wiki/Juju_Chang \"Juju\nChang\").[14]\n\nIn the summer of 2011, _Good Morning America_ decided to vacate the second\nfloor of the Times Square studios, which overlooked Times Square, due to cost\nissues. On September 6, 2011, the program began broadcasting from an entirely\nnew studio set located on the first floor (ground level) of the Times Square\nstudios.
