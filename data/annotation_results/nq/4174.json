Its name derives from the\ntypically white [plumage](/wiki/Plumage \"Plumage\").

They fly as far south as\nTexas and Mexico during winter, and return to nest on the Arctic tundra each\nspring.[6] It is a rare vagrant to [Europe](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\"), but a\nfrequent escape from collections and an occasional feral breeder. Snow geese\nare visitors to the [British Isles](/wiki/British_Isles \"British Isles\") where\nthey are seen regularly among flocks of [barnacle](/wiki/Barnacle_goose\n\"Barnacle goose\"), [Brent](/wiki/Brent_goose \"Brent goose\") and [Greenland\nwhite-fronted](/wiki/White-fronted_goose \"White-fronted goose\") geese.

White-morph birds are white except for\nblack wing tips, but blue-morph geese have bluish-grey plumage replacing the\nwhite except on the head, neck and tail tip. The immature blue phase is drab\nor slate-gray with little to no white on the head, neck, or belly. Both snow\nand blue phases have rose-red feet and legs, and pink bills with black\n[tomia](/wiki/Tomia \"Tomia\") (\"cutting edges\"), giving them a black \"grin\npatch\". The colors are not as bright on the feet, legs, and bill of immature\nbirds. The head can be stained rusty-brown from minerals in the soil where\nthey feed. They are very vocal and can often be heard from more than a mile\naway.\n\nWhite- and blue-morph birds interbreed and the offspring may be of either\nmorph. These two colors of geese were once thought to be separate species;\nsince they interbreed and are found together throughout their ranges, they are\nnow considered two color phases of the same species. The color phases are\ngenetically controlled. The dark phase results from a single dominant gene and\nthe white phase is homozygous recessive. When choosing a mate, young birds\nwill most often select a mate that resembles their parents' coloring. If the\nbirds were hatched into a mixed pair, they will mate with either color phase.\n\nThe species is divided into two [subspecies](/wiki/Subspecies \"Subspecies\") on\nthe basis of size and geography. Size overlap has caused some to question the\ndivision.[6] The smaller subspecies, the lesser snow goose (_C. c.\ncaerulescens_), lives from central northern Canada to the [Bering\nStraits](/wiki/Bering_Straits \"Bering Straits\") area. The lesser snow goose\nstands 64 to 79 cm (25 to 31 in) tall and weighs 2.05 to 2.7 kg (4.5 to 6.0\nlb). The larger subspecies, the greater snow goose (_C. c. atlanticus_), nests\nin northeastern Canada. It averages about 3.2 kg (7.1 lb) and 79 cm (31 in),\nbut can weigh up to 4.5 kg (9.9 lb). The wingspan for both subspecies ranges\nfrom 135 to 165 cm (53 to 65 in). Blue-morph birds are rare among the greater\nsnow geese and among eastern populations of the lesser.\n\n## Breeding[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Snow_goose&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Breeding\")]\n\n![File:Greater Snow\nGeese.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Greater_Snow_Geese.ogv/220px\n--Greater_Snow_Geese.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Greater_Snow_Geese.ogv\n\"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Greater_Snow_Geese.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\nGreater snow geese in flight\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Anser_caerulescens_CT8.jpg/220px-\nAnser_caerulescens_CT8.jpg)](/wiki/File:Anser_caerulescens_CT8.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Anser_caerulescens_CT8.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSnow geese (Anser caerulescens)\n\nLong-term pair bonds are usually formed in the second year, although breeding\ndoes not usually start until the third year. Females are strongly philopatric,\nmeaning they will return to the place they hatched to breed.\n\nSnow geese often nest in colonies. Nesting usually begins at the end of May or\nduring the first few days of June, depending on snow conditions. The female\nselects a nest site and builds the nest on an area of high ground. The nest is\na shallow depression lined with plant material and may be reused from year to\nyear. After the female lays the first of three to five eggs, she lines the\nnest with down. The female incubates for 22 to 25 days, and the young leave\nthe nest within a few hours of hatching.\n\nThe young feed themselves, but are protected by both parents. After 42 to 50\ndays they can fly, but they remain with their family until they are two to\nthree years old.\n\nWhere snow geese and [Ross's geese](/wiki/Ross%27s_goose \"Ross's goose\") breed\ntogether, as at La PÃ©rouse, they hybridize at times, and hybrids are fertile.\nRare hybrids with the [greater white-fronted goose](/wiki/Greater_white-\nfronted_goose \"Greater white-fronted goose\"), [Canada\ngoose](/wiki/Canada_goose \"Canada goose\"), and [cackling\ngoose](/wiki/Cackling_goose \"Cackling goose\") have been observed.[6]\n\n## Migration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Snow_goose&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Migration\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Snow_Geese_in_Fir_Island_field_-_2009.jpg/220px-\nSnow_Geese_in_Fir_Island_field_-_2009.jpg)](/wiki/File:Snow_Geese_in_Fir_Island_field_-_2009.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Snow_Geese_in_Fir_Island_field_-_2009.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSnow geese in a corn field on [Fir Island,\nWashington](/wiki/Fir_Island_\\(Washington\\) \"Fir Island \\(Washington\\)\") in\nthe [Skagit River](/wiki/Skagit_River \"Skagit River\") delta\n\nSnow geese breed from late May to mid-August, but they leave their nesting\nareas and spend more than half the year on their migration to-and-from warmer\nwintering areas. During spring migration (the reverse migration), large flocks\nof snow geese fly very high and migrate in large numbers along narrow\ncorridors, more than 3,000 mi (4,800 km) from traditional wintering areas to\nthe tundra.\n\nThe lesser snow goose travels through the [Central\nFlyway](/wiki/Central_Flyway \"Central Flyway\"), [Mississippi\nFlyway](/wiki/Mississippi_Flyway \"Mississippi Flyway\"), and [Pacific\nFlyway](/wiki/Pacific_Flyway \"Pacific Flyway\") across prairie and rich\nfarmland to their wintering grounds on grassland and agricultural fields\nacross the United States and Mexico, especially the [Gulf coastal\nplain](/wiki/Gulf_Coastal_Plain \"Gulf Coastal Plain\"). The larger and less\nnumerous greater snow goose travels through the [Atlantic\nFlyway](/wiki/Atlantic_Flyway \"Atlantic Flyway\") and winters on a relatively\nmore restricted range on the [Atlantic coastal\nplain](/wiki/Atlantic_coastal_plain \"Atlantic coastal plain\"). Traditionally,\nlesser snow geese wintered in coastal marsh areas where they used their short\nbut strong bills to dig up the roots of marsh grasses for food. However, they\nhave also since shifted inland towards agricultural areas, likely the cause\nbehind the unsustainable population increase in the 20th century. This shift\nmay help to contribute to increased goose survival rates, leading to\novergrazing on tundra breeding grounds.[8]\n\nIn March 2015, 2,000 snow geese were killed in northern [Idaho](/wiki/Idaho\n\"Idaho\") from an [avian cholera](/wiki/Avian_cholera \"Avian cholera\") epidemic\nwhile flying their spring migration to northern [Canada](/wiki/Canada\n\"Canada\").[9]\n\n## Ecology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Snow_goose&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Ecology\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Chen_caerulescens_32880.JPG/220px-\nChen_caerulescens_32880.JPG)](/wiki/File:Chen_caerulescens_32880.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chen_caerulescens_32880.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nWintering snow geese on Fir Island, Washington\n\nOutside of the nesting season, they usually feed in flocks. In winter, snow\ngeese feed on left-over grain in fields. They migrate in large flocks, often\nvisiting traditional stopover habitats in spectacular numbers. Snow geese\nfrequently travel and feed alongside [greater white-fronted\ngeese](/wiki/Greater_white-fronted_goose \"Greater white-fronted goose\"); in\ncontrast, the two tend to avoid travelling and feeding alongside [Canada\ngeese](/wiki/Canada_geese \"Canada geese\"), which are often heavier\nbirds.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nThe population of greater snow geese was in decline at the beginning of the\n20th century, but has now recovered to sustainable levels. Snow geese in North\nAmerica have increased to the point where the [tundra](/wiki/Tundra \"Tundra\")\nbreeding areas in the Arctic and the saltmarsh wintering grounds are both\nbecoming severely degraded,[10] and this affects other species using the same\nhabitat.\n\nMajor nest predators include [Arctic foxes](/wiki/Arctic_fox \"Arctic fox\") and\n[skuas](/wiki/Skua \"Skua\").[11] The biggest threat occurs during the first\ncouple of weeks after the eggs are laid and then after hatching. The eggs and\nyoung chicks are vulnerable to these predators, but adults are generally safe.\nThey have been seen nesting near [snowy owl](/wiki/Snowy_owl \"Snowy owl\")\nnests, which is likely a solution to predation. Their nesting success was much\nlower when snowy owls were absent, leading scientists to believe that the\nowls, since they are predatory, were capable of keeping competing predators\naway from the nests. A similar association as with the owls has been noted\nbetween geese and [rough-legged hawks](/wiki/Rough-legged_hawk \"Rough-legged\nhawk\").[11] Additional predators at the nest have reportedly included\n[wolves](/wiki/Gray_wolf \"Gray wolf\"), [coyotes](/wiki/Coyote \"Coyote\") and\nall three North American bear species.[12][13] Few predators regularly prey on\nsnow geese outside of the nesting season, but [bald eagles](/wiki/Bald_eagle\n\"Bald eagle\") (as well as possibly [golden eagles](/wiki/Golden_eagle \"Golden\neagle\")) will readily attack wintering geese.[13]\n\n## Population[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Snow_goose&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Population\")]\n\nThe breeding population of the lesser snow goose exceeds 5 million birds, an\nincrease of more than 300% since the mid-1970s. The population is increasing\nat a rate of more than five percent per year. Non-breeding geese (juveniles or\nadults that fail to nest successfully) are not included in this estimate, so\nthe total number of geese is likely higher. Lesser snow goose population\nindices are the highest they have been since population records have been\nkept, and evidence suggests that large breeding populations are spreading to\npreviously untouched sections of the Hudson Bay coastline. The cause of this\noverpopulation may be the heavy conversion of land from forest and prairie to\nagricultural usage in the 20th century.\n\nSince the late 1990s, efforts have been underway in the U.S. and Canada to\nreduce the North American population of lesser snow and Ross's geese to\nsustainable levels due to the documented destruction of tundra habitat in\nHudson Bay and other nesting areas. The Light Goose Conservation Order was\nestablished in 1997 and federally mandated in 1999. Increasing hunter bag\nlimits, extending the length of hunting seasons, and adding new hunting\nmethods have all been successfully implemented, but have not reduced the\noverall population of Snow Geese in North America.[14][15]\n\n## Conservation Order for Light\nGeese[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Snow_goose&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Conservation Order for Light Geese\")]\n\nThe late 90's was when the mid-continent population of snow geese was\nrecognized as causing significant damage to the arctic and sub-arctic breeding\ngrounds which was also causing critical damage to other varieties of waterfowl\nspecies and other wildlife that uses the arctic and sub-arctic grounds for\nhome habitat. The increase in population in substantial amounts raised concern\nto then DU chief biologist Dr. Bruce Batt who was part of a committee that put\ntogether various data and submitted it to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\nand the Candian Wildlife Service with the recommendation on ways to combat the\ngrowing population and the damage that the snow geese were creating in the\narctic breeding grounds.\n\nIt was recommended by the committee to relax hunting restrictions and give\nhunters a better opportunity to harvest more snow geese on their way back to\nthe breeding grounds in the spring. The suggested restrictions we're to allow\nthe use of electronic callers, unplugged shotguns, extended shooting hours,\nand no bag limits. Two years after the Light Goose Conservation Order was\nintroduced it was federally mandated in 1999.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Snow_goose&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** BirdLife International (2016).
