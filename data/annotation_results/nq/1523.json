In\n1973 Garfield’s great-great-grandson, Phillip Chancellor II, was running\nChancellor Industries. He resided in the Chancellor mansion with his alcoholic\nand promiscuous wife Katherine (Kay). The two barely communicated with each\nother as husband and wife, and the lonely Phillip, driven to distraction by\nKatherine’s obsessive behavior, sought refuge in the company of Katherine’s\nyoung and beautiful paid companion, Jill Foster. [1] Phillip and Jill fell in\nlove, Jill was a virgin but became pregnant the one and only time they made\nlove. Phillip obtained a divorce from Katherine in the Dominican Republic, but\nKatherine got her revenge by picking Phillip up from the airport on his\nreturn, and drove him off a cliff when he refused to give her another chance.\nPhillip married Jill on his deathbed in order to provide for her and their\nunborn child. However, Katherine later had Phillip's divorce from her\ninvalidated, on the basis she was drunk when she signed the divorce papers,\nwhich automatically annulled Phillip and Jill's marriage. So Katherine was\nreinstated as Phillip's legal widow. Phillip's affair with Jill Foster\nproduced a son, Phillip III. The stage was set for a long and bitter feud\nbetween the two women that would continue for decades.\n\n  *     * _[Katherine Chancellor](/wiki/Katherine_Chancellor \"Katherine Chancellor\")_ ([Jeanne Cooper](/wiki/Jeanne_Cooper \"Jeanne Cooper\"))   \nBorn on October 25, 1928 as Katherine Shepherd, and known affectionately as\nKay, Katherine marries high school and college sweetheart Gary Reynolds.\nTogether they have one son, Brock. When Brock and Gary are out of the country,\nKatherine has an affair with Gary's golfing buddy, [Arthur\nHendricks](/wiki/The_Young_and_the_Restless_characters_\\(2000s\\)#Arthur_Hendricks\n\"The Young and the Restless characters \\(2000s\\)\") and later gives birth to\nhis son, Tucker, who she secretly gave up for adoption without even seeing\nhim. After Gary's passing, Katherine marries Phillip Chancellor. However,\nKatherine and Phillip's unhappy marriage is upended by Jill Foster who gets\npregnant with his child. The two women would fight over everything from men to\nchildren for the next four decades. Katherine was remarried in 2009 to Patrick\nMurphy.[2] Katherine dies on August 1, 2013 at the age of 84.[3]\n\n### Second\nGeneration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chancellor_Family&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Second Generation\")]\n\n  * [Brock Reynolds](/wiki/The_Young_and_the_Restless_characters_\\(1970s\\)#Brock_Reynolds \"The Young and the Restless characters \\(1970s\\)\") ([Beau Kazer](/wiki/Beau_Kazer \"Beau Kazer\"))   \nBrock is Katherine's son with her first husband, Gary Reynolds.

After\nPhillip's death, Katherine relied on good friend [Victor\nNewman](/wiki/Victor_Newman \"Victor Newman\") to keep an eye on things, and on\nMitchell Sherman for legal advice. [20] In later years Jill Foster Abbott,\n[Neil Winters](/wiki/Neil_Winters \"Neil Winters\"), and Cane Ashby all acted as\nCEO. For a brief period Katherine hired [Jack\nAbbott](/wiki/Jack_Abbott_\\(The_Young_and_the_Restless\\) \"Jack Abbott \\(The\nYoung and the Restless\\)\") as CEO. It was also the parent company of Jabot\nCosmetics.\n\nThe company was referred to as a sleeping giant according to former CEO [Jack\nAbbott](/wiki/Jack_Abbott_\\(The_Young_and_the_Restless\\) \"Jack Abbott \\(The\nYoung and the Restless\\)\"), CI was \"financially capable and always without\nscandal.\"\n\nFor a couple years CI was wholly owned subsidiary of [Tucker McCall\nUnlimited](/wiki/Tucker_McCall \"Tucker McCall\") when Katherine's long lost\nson, billionaire business mogul [Tucker McCall](/wiki/Tucker_McCall \"Tucker\nMcCall\") assumed ownership via a hostile takeover. Tucker eventually sold\nKatherine majority ownership of CI under pressure from [Victor\nNewman](/wiki/Victor_Newman \"Victor Newman\").\n\nA couple of weeks after Katherine's funeral, on September 27, 2013, Victor\nNewman received a letter from Katherine leaving him Chancellor Industries. Her\nletter to him read: _My Dear friend Victor, by the time you read this, you\nwill have learned of my passing. I lived a long and colorful life and have no\nregrets about entering the next phase of my journey, save one. I wanted to\nensure the longevity of my beloved Chancellor Industries. That is why I 've\ndecided to name you the sole owner of the company. I hope you will accept this\ngift in the loving spirit in which it was given. Love, Katherine._ As the new\nmajority shareholder and Chairman of Chancellor Industries, Victor immediately\nplans a merger between Chancellor and [Newman\nEnterprises](/wiki/Newman_Enterprises \"Newman Enterprises\"). The new company\nis titled Newman-Chancellor Industries.\n\nVictor was having cash management issues due to some bad acquisitions, so it\nbecame necessary for him to sell Chancellor Industries. He gave Jill an\nexclusive opportunity before putting it on the market, acknowledging\n\n    \n    \n    _\" If Katherine would want the company to go to anyone but me, I think it would be Jill.\"_ [21] On February 2, 2015 Jill Foster Abbott bought Chancellor Industries from Victor Newman.\n    \n\nCurrently Jill Foster Abbott Atkinson is the sole owner of Chancellor\nIndustries. Cane Ashby is its CEO. Katherine's grandson [Devon\nHamilton](/wiki/Devon_Hamilton \"Devon Hamilton\") loaned Jill some of the money\nfor the purchase initially because of a blackmail attempt by Jill's husband,\nand Cane's father [Colin\nAtkinson](/wiki/The_Young_and_the_Restless_characters_\\(2010\\)#Colin_Atkinson\n\"The Young and the Restless characters \\(2010\\)\"). But later Devon gave the\nmoney of his own free will explaining _\" You know, Jill, Katherine gave me\nthis money to do what I want with it, and what I want is for you and Cane to\nhave the company. I really do.
