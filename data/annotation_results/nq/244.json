Gourley and Jennifer.[4][5] He and his two\nsiblings grew up in [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska \"Alaska\") moving from town to town,\nwherever their father's contracting business took the family.[4][6] Gourley's\nparents both competed in the [Iditarod](/wiki/Iditarod \"Iditarod\"), and for a\nwhile the family lived in a remote \"off the grid\" cabin accessible only by\ndogsled.[4][7] He grew up helping to take care of dozens of\n[mushing](/wiki/Mushing \"Mushing\") dogs.\n\nHe attended [Wasilla High School](/wiki/Wasilla_High_School \"Wasilla High\nSchool\"), but dropped out at age 15 to study at home and work in construction\nwith his father.[4][8]\n\nGourley joined four fellow [Wasilla](/wiki/Wasilla,_Alaska \"Wasilla, Alaska\")\nmusicians: his best friend Zach Carothers and the three members of band Nice\nGuy Eddie (Dewey Halpaus, Joe Simon, and Nick Simon), to form punk band\n[Anatomy of a Ghost](/wiki/Anatomy_of_a_Ghost \"Anatomy of a Ghost\") in\n2002.[5][9] They toured across the country and released their album\n_[Evanesce](/wiki/Evanesce_\\(album\\) \"Evanesce \\(album\\)\")_ in October 2003 on\n[Fearless Records](/wiki/Fearless_Records \"Fearless Records\"). The members\nwanted to pursue their own ideas, however, so the band split up in May 2004.\nGourley and bassist Carothers formed the nucleus of [Portugal. The\nMan](/wiki/Portugal._The_Man \"Portugal. The Man\").[10]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=John_Gourley&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Gette-King, Dylan (22 December 2011).
