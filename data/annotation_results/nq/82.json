He lived in colonial [Concord,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Concord,_Massachusetts \"Concord, Massachusetts\"), among\nhis large extended family. (His uncle was [Jonathan\nPrescott](/wiki/Jonathan_Prescott_\\(military_officer\\) \"Jonathan Prescott\n\\(military officer\\)\").) Much of this history was probably passed on to the\nfamily by his grand uncle Samuel Prescott, who knew many of the early\nPrescotts, and was even old enough to remember the first ancestor of the\nConcord branch of the family, John Prescott,[2] founder of [Lancaster,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Lancaster,_Massachusetts \"Lancaster, Massachusetts\").[3]\nIndeed, the Prescotts and their extended family played an important and often\nheroic role in colonial history. These include settling Concord, fighting in\ncolonial wars, and negotiating for the ransom of [Mary\nRowlandson](/wiki/Mary_Rowlandson \"Mary Rowlandson\").[4]\n\nPrescott followed in the footsteps of his older brother Benjamin and\napprenticed under his father, Abel Prescott, for about seven years. He appears\nto have kept an extremely low profile during pre-revolutionary times as well\nas afterward, as best can be attained. He did open a practice in Concord, just\nbefore or after which time he began to court Lydia Mulliken, daughter of a\nwell-respected Lexington clockmaker who had died in 1767.[5]\n\nDuring the latter part of his [apprenticeship](/wiki/Apprenticeship\n\"Apprenticeship\") or shortly after he began his medical practice, he became an\nactive member in the [patriot movement](/wiki/Patriot_\\(American_Revolution\\)\n\"Patriot \\(American Revolution\\)\"). There is strong circumstantial evidence\nthat he was an express courier for the [Sons of Liberty](/wiki/Sons_of_Liberty\n\"Sons of Liberty\") and the [Committees of\nCorrespondence](/wiki/Committees_of_Correspondence \"Committees of\nCorrespondence\"), and that he was an important liaison between the Concord\nDefense Committee and [John Hancock](/wiki/John_Hancock \"John Hancock\") and\nother leaders of the patriots.[6]\n\n## The Ride[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Samuel_Prescott&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: The Ride\")]\n\nOn the evening of April 18, 1775, [Paul Revere](/wiki/Paul_Revere \"Paul\nRevere\") and [William Dawes](/wiki/William_Dawes \"William Dawes\") were\ndispatched by [Joseph Warren](/wiki/Joseph_Warren \"Joseph Warren\") to warn the\ncountryside that the British were coming. Prescott was in Lexington at the\ntime to visit with his fiancée, Lydia Mulliken.[7] He was also there to report\non Concord's readiness, its status in hiding supplies and munitions from the\nBritish, and its success in moving cannon to Groton lest it fall into British\nhands.[8] The British wanted the military stores at Concord and had hoped to\ncapture [Samuel Adams](/wiki/Samuel_Adams \"Samuel Adams\") and John Hancock in\nthe process.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nWhen Prescott left Lexington, it was about 1 a.m. the next morning, April 19.\nOn his way back to Concord he met Paul Revere and William Dawes, who had just\nleft Lexington shortly before him and were also on their way to Concord—to\nwarn the town that the Redcoats were on the march.[9]\n\nWhen the three continued on to Hartwell's tavern in the lower bounds of\nLincoln, they were cut off by four British horseman who were part of a larger\nscouting party sent out the preceding evening. Revere was captured but both\nPrescott and Dawes succeeded in making a run for it. Prescott did so with a\nshow of artful horsemanship and knowledge of the forest. Finally losing his\npursuers, he circled about and headed quickly to Concord, carrying Revere's\nwarning to his townsmen.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nDawes also escaped from his pursuers, but it was after a close chase, a\nfrantic ruse on his part, and a bit of luck. Once he was safe, he considered\ncircling around the patrol and racing on to Concord much as Prescott had, but\nhe heard the Concord town house bell and knew Prescott had made it there, and\nso he continued on his special mission, for he was only assigned to accompany\nRevere to Concord.[10] Prescott, meanwhile, continued west to warn Acton,\nMassachusetts while his brother [Abel Prescott, Jr.](/wiki/Abel_Prescott,_Jr.\n\"Abel Prescott, Jr.\") rode south to warn\n[Sudbury](/wiki/Sudbury,_Massachusetts \"Sudbury, Massachusetts\") and\n[Framingham](/wiki/Framingham,_Massachusetts \"Framingham, Massachusetts\"). By\nthis time, countless riders were also dispatched from other towns to spread\nthe warning—while bells and cannon were rung or fired to punctuate the danger\nat hand.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nBecause of the \"midnight\" rides of Revere, Dawes, Prescott, and many other\nexpresses (couriers), [minutemen](/wiki/Minutemen \"Minutemen\") and\n[militia](/wiki/Militia \"Militia\") everywhere were on the ready, many marching\nto Concord to effectively engage the British Army at the Battles of Lexington\nand Concord. Prescott was there to witness the [Battle of\nConcord](/wiki/Battle_of_Concord \"Battle of Concord\"), then tried to beat the\nBritish back to Lexington to see Lydia Mulliken and her family and to help\nwith the wounded.[11] He remained at Lexington as a volunteer surgeon for\nabout two weeks, then seems to have disappeared into the war.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Concord_Expedition_and_Patriot_Messengers.jpg/800px-\nConcord_Expedition_and_Patriot_Messengers.jpg)](/wiki/File:Concord_Expedition_and_Patriot_Messengers.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Concord_Expedition_and_Patriot_Messengers.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [National Park Service](/wiki/National_Park_Service \"National Park Service\")\nmap showing the route of the initial\n[Patriot](/wiki/Patriot_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Patriot \\(American\nRevolution\\)\") messengers including Prescott (purple trail)\n\n## Prescott's life following \"The\nRide\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Samuel_Prescott&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Prescott's life following \"The Ride\"\")]\n\nThere is evidence that Prescott went on to serve as a surgeon in the\n[Continental Army](/wiki/Continental_Army \"Continental Army\"), a tradition\nthat he joined the crew of a New England [privateer](/wiki/Privateer\n\"Privateer\"), and a report that he was in prison in [Halifax, Nova\nScotia](/wiki/City_of_Halifax \"City of Halifax\"), where he may have died\nbetween November 23, 1776 and December 26 (1777?).[12] There is also\ncircumstantial evidence that he served in some medical support capacity out of\n[Fort Ticonderoga](/wiki/Fort_Ticonderoga \"Fort Ticonderoga\") during the\ninvasion attempts against Canada and until about the time of [Benedict\nArnold](/wiki/Benedict_Arnold \"Benedict Arnold\")'s failed attempts against\n[Sir Guy Carleton](/wiki/Sir_Guy_Carleton \"Sir Guy Carleton\") on [Lake\nChamplain](/wiki/Lake_Champlain \"Lake Champlain\").[13]\n\n## Legacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Samuel_Prescott&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Legacy\")]\n\nPrescott's ride is re-enacted every [Patriots' Day](/wiki/Patriots%27_Day\n\"Patriots' Day\") eve (observed) in the Town of Acton. The re-enactment begins\nin East Acton, continues through Acton Center, and ends at Liberty Tree Farm,\nwhere once was the home of a minuteman named Simon Hunt. The distance is\napproximately five miles (8 km).\n\nThere are also re-enactments on Patriots' Day (usually the third Monday of\nApril) of the rides of William Dawes and Paul Revere, to commemorate the\nfamous \"midnight\" ride that began in the evening hours of April 18 and\ncontinued on April 19.\n\nPrescott's ride is re-enacted every year at midnight April 18–19 at Concord's\nFirst Parish Church. The re-enactment is preceded by a Patriots' Ball. The\nMinute Men march with fife and drum leading the attendees from the armory to\nthe church. The Captain of the Concord Minute Men reads a message handed him\nby \"Prescott\" on horseback.\n\nA memorial plaque to Prescott is at his former home in Concord,\nMassachusetts.[14]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Samuel_Prescott&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * _[Liberty's Kids](/wiki/Liberty%27s_Kids \"Liberty's Kids\")_\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Samuel_Prescott&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Selesky, H.
