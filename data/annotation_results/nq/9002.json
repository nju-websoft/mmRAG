Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an\n[alternate dimension](/wiki/Parallel_universe_\\(fiction\\) \"Parallel universe\n\\(fiction\\)\") called \"the Upside Down\".

The\nnext day, Mike nicknames her \"El\". She says that \"bad people\" are looking for\nher and refuses to meet Mike's parents. Scientists from the laboratory find a\nsubstance oozing from the walls of Joyce's home. At Mike's home, Eleven\nrecognizes and points out Will in a photo. Dustin and Lucas want to inform\nMike's parents about Eleven, but she uses [psychokinesis](/wiki/Psychokinesis\n\"Psychokinesis\") to stop them. While searching for Will, Mr. Clarke, the boys'\nscience teacher, discovers a scrap of a hospital gown outside the laboratory\ngrounds. Nancy goes with her friend Barb to a party at her boyfriend Steve's\nhouse. Will's brother Jonathan investigates the woods where Will went missing.\nHearing screaming, he runs to help but finds only Steve, Nancy, and their\nfriends roughhousing around Steve's swimming pool. He secretly photographs\nthem. Barb, left alone by the poolside, vanishes. Joyce receives another call\nfrom Will, hears music from his room, and sees something coming through the\nwall.  \n3 | 3 | \"Chapter Three: Holly, Jolly\" | [Shawn Levy](/wiki/Shawn_Levy \"Shawn Levy\") | Jessica Mecklenburg | July 15, 2016 (2016-07-15)  \nBarb wakes up in an empty and decaying pool. She screams for Nancy and\nattempts to climb out but is dragged down by something unseen. Joyce strings\n[Christmas lights](/wiki/Christmas_lights \"Christmas lights\") around her home\nto talk to Will, who can turn them on and off. Hawkins Lab director Dr. Martin\nBrenner allows Hopper to view the lab's security camera footage. Hopper\nrealizes it is fake. He and his deputies research Hawkins Lab, Brenner, and a\nwoman named Terry Ives who claimed her daughter was taken by Brenner. Eleven\nhas a flashback in which Brenner, whom she calls \"Papa\", has her put in\n[solitary confinement](/wiki/Solitary_confinement \"Solitary confinement\") for\nrefusing to telekinetically harm a cat. Nancy worries about Barb, who is\nmissing. Steve and his friends discover Jonathan's photographs. They destroy\nthem and his camera. Nancy recovers a photo of Barb by the poolside and\nreturns to Steve's house to search for her. Nancy finds Barb's car and sees\nthe creature in the woods. Joyce establishes a code with Will using the\nlights, which he uses to tell her that he is alive but unsafe. He tells Joyce\nto run as a creature begins to climb through her wall. Will's apparent body is\ndiscovered in the water at a quarry.  \n4 | 4 | \"Chapter Four: The Body\" | Shawn Levy | Justin Doble | July 15, 2016 (2016-07-15)  \nEleven proves to the boys that Will is still alive by making contact through\nMike's [walkie-talkie](/wiki/Walkie-talkie \"Walkie-talkie\"). Joyce goes to the\nmorgue to view the body and refuses to believe it is Will. The boys give\nEleven a makeover so they can sneak her into school. Joyce hears Will in her\nliving room wall. Tearing away the wallpaper, she sees him behind a membrane.\nAt school, Eleven uses Mr. Clarke's [ham radio](/wiki/Ham_radio \"Ham radio\")\nto channel Will talking to his mother. Joyce demolishes the wall with an axe\nbut reveals only her front porch. Nancy discovers a figure behind Barb in\nJonathan's photo. Jonathan realizes that the figure matches his mother's\ndescription of the creature: a humanoid figure with long arms and no face.\nNancy tells the police about her missing friend and subsequently admits to her\nmother that she slept with Steve. When she tells Steve about the police, she\nis irritated that he cares only about not getting in trouble with his father.\nHopper confronts the state trooper who found Will's body and beats him until\nhe admits he was ordered to lie. Hopper goes to the morgue and finds that\nWill's supposed body is a dummy. He breaks into Hawkins laboratory.  \n5 | 5 | \"Chapter Five: The Flea and the Acrobat\" | The Duffer Brothers | Alison Tatlock | July 15, 2016 (2016-07-15)  \nWill's father Lonnie assures Joyce her experiences are hallucinations. Hopper\ndiscovers a portal in the basement levels of the lab, before he is knocked\nout. He wakes back in home, and discovers a hidden microphone. Mike, Lucas,\nand Dustin, with Eleven's help, determine Will is trapped in an alternate\ndimension Eleven calls the \"Upside Down\", and their science teacher Mr. Clarke\nconfirms the possibility of portals to alternate dimensions. The boys use\ncompasses to locate disruptions in the [electromagnetic\nfield](/wiki/Electromagnetic_field \"Electromagnetic field\") that would be\ncaused by a portal, but find that Eleven has been purposely affecting the\nfield, as she does not want to go back to the lab, having memories of being\nput into a [sensory-deprivation tank](/wiki/Isolation_tank \"Isolation tank\")\nthat allowed her to enter the Upside Down, where she saw the creature. Mike\nand Lucas get into an argument, and Eleven telekinetically flings Lucas off\nMike, and she then disappears. In the woods, Nancy and Jonathan find a wounded\ndeer which is suddenly dragged away by the creature, and subsequently find a\nportal to the Upside Down. Nancy crawls through and observes the creature\neating the deer, before it discovers her.  \n6 | 6 | \"Chapter Six: The Monster\" | The Duffer Brothers | Jessie Nickson-Lopez | July 15, 2016 (2016-07-15)  \nJonathan pulls Nancy through the portal and saves her from the monster.

Nancy and Jonathan resolve to kill the monster and purchase supplies\nfrom an [army surplus store](/wiki/Surplus_store \"Surplus store\"). During a\nfist fight with Steve, Jonathan is arrested after he inadvertently assaults an\nofficer. Joyce and Hopper track down Terry Ives, who is catatonic and tended\nby her sister Becky. Becky explains that Terry underwent [Project\nMKUltra](/wiki/Project_MKUltra \"Project MKUltra\") testing while unknowingly\npregnant; she believed her daughter Jane was kidnapped by Brenner at birth.\nJoyce and Hopper conclude Eleven is likely Jane. Eleven recalls being asked to\ncontact the monster and how the portal to the Upside Down opened in the\nlaboratory basement.

Kali helps Eleven\nimprove her powers by helping to channel her anger. Eleven joins them as they\nattack Ray, the lab technician that performed shock therapy on Terry, who\nclaims Dr. Brenner is still alive. Kali tries to have Eleven kill Ray, but\nEleven refuses when she finds Ray has two daughters. They flee back to the\ngang's base, and Kali insists Eleven either stay and avenge her mother, or\nleave.

Night Shyamalan](/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan\n\"M. Night Shyamalan\"), however, due to changes at [Warner\nBros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\"), its distributor, the film did not\nsee a wide release and the Duffers were unsure of their future.[29] To their\nsurprise, television producer [Donald De Line](/wiki/Donald_De_Line \"Donald De\nLine\") approached them, impressed with _Hidden_ 's script, and offered them\nthe opportunity to work on episodes of _[Wayward Pines](/wiki/Wayward_Pines\n\"Wayward Pines\")_ alongside Shyamalan. The brothers were mentored by Shyamalan\nduring the episode's production, so that when they finished, they felt they\nwere ready to produce their own television series.[30]\n\nThe Duffer Brothers prepared a script that would essentially be similar to the\nseries' actual pilot episode, along with a 20-page pitch book to help shop the\nseries around for a network.[31] They pitched the story to a number of [cable\nnetworks](/wiki/Cable_network \"Cable network\"), all of which rejected the\nscript on the basis that they felt a plot centered around children as leading\ncharacters would not work, asking them to make it a children's show or to drop\nthe children and focus on Hopper's investigation in the paranormal.[30] In\nearly 2015, Dan Cohen, the VP of [21 Laps\nEntertainment](/wiki/21_Laps_Entertainment \"21 Laps Entertainment\"), brought\nthe script to his colleague [Shawn Levy](/wiki/Shawn_Levy \"Shawn Levy\"). They\nsubsequently invited the Duffer Brothers to their office and purchased the\nrights for the series, giving full authorship of it to the brothers. After\nreading the pilot, the streaming service [Netflix](/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\")\npurchased the whole season for an undisclosed amount;[32] the show was\nsubsequently announced for a planned 2016 release by Netflix in early April\n2015.[33] The Duffer Brothers stated that at the time they had pitched to\nNetflix, the service had already gotten recognized for its original\nprogramming, such as _[House of Cards](/wiki/House_of_Cards_\\(U.S._TV_series\\)\n\"House of Cards \\(U.S. TV series\\)\")_ and _[Orange Is the New\nBlack](/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black \"Orange Is the New Black\")_ , with well-\nrecognized producers behind them, and were ready to start giving upcoming\nproducers like them a chance.[31] The brothers started to write out the series\nand brought Levy and Cohen in as executive producers to start casting and\nfilming.[34]\n\nThe series was originally known as _Montauk_ , as the setting of the script\nwas in [Montauk, New York](/wiki/Montauk,_New_York \"Montauk, New York\") and\nnearby [Long Island](/wiki/Long_Island \"Long Island\") locations.[33][35] The\nbrothers had chosen Montauk as it had further Spielberg ties with the film\n_[Jaws](/wiki/Jaws_\\(film\\) \"Jaws \\(film\\)\")_ , where Montauk was used for the\nfictional setting of Amity Island.[36] After deciding to change the narrative\nof the series to take place in the fictional town of Hawkins instead, the\nbrothers felt they could now do things to the town, such as placing it under\nquarantine, that they really could not envision with a real location.[36] With\nthe change in location, they had to come up with a new title for the series\nunder direction from Netflix's Ted Sarandos so that they could start marketing\nit to the public. The brothers started by using a copy of Stephen King's\n_[Firestarter](/wiki/Firestarter_\\(novel\\) \"Firestarter \\(novel\\)\")_ novel to\nconsider the title's font and appearance, and came up with a long list of\npotential alternatives. _Stranger Things_ came about as it sounded similar to\nanother King novel, _[Needful Things](/wiki/Needful_Things \"Needful Things\")_\n, though Matt noted they still had a \"lot of heated arguments\" over this final\ntitle.[37]\n\nWith the critical success of the first season after its release in July 2016,\nspeculation on a possible second season was raised. By the end of July, the\nDuffer Brothers had outlined a plan for such a season if it was [green-\nlit](/wiki/Green-light \"Green-light\"),[38] and Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings\nsaid in early August that the company \"would be dumb not to\" renew _Stranger\nThings_ for a second season.[39] On August 31, 2016, Netflix announced it had\nrenewed _Stranger Things_ for a second season of nine episodes, to be released\nin 2017.[40] The Duffer Brothers revealed that the series had been renewed for\na second season before the first premiered. Regarding the decision to wait\nmore than a month after the first season premiered to announce the renewal,\nMatt Duffer said, \"it actually ended up working because it had built up to\nthis fever pitch. I guess that’s what [Netflix] were intending to do all the\ntime.\"[41]\n\nThe Duffers wrote the second season to make the combined first and second\nseason feel like a complete work, but setting elements in place to go forward\nwith additional seasons if they are green-lit.[42] While most of the story for\nthe second season had been decided before the first season aired, the Duffers\ntook in the audience reactions from the first season to adjust some of the\ndetails within the second season. They knew they would not have the same\nelement of audience surprise as when the show aired anew, and were aware fans\nwanted to see certain elements, but Ross said \"...the point is not to give\neveryone what they think they want. Because I don’t think they really know\nwhat they want.\"[43] The Duffers felt that the second season should be treated\nmore as a [sequel](/wiki/Sequel \"Sequel\") rather than a continuation, and thus\nhave opted to call the second _Stranger Things 2_. This approach had some\ntrepidation from Netflix, since the company felt movie sequels typically have\na bad reputation, but the Duffers pointed out that there had been many\nsuccessful sequels that surpassed the original film, and felt confident with\nthis name.[6] Despite revealing episode titles for the season in the\nannouncement teaser in order \"to provide some hint of where we were going in\nseason two without giving anything away,\"[44][41] Matt Duffer stated that some\nof the titles would change, since there were some things \"we didn't want to\nput on there because we felt like it would give too much away,\"[41] and\nbecause \"people are smart on the fucking internet\" with fan-created \"videos\nanalyzing the chapter titles... right on a lot\" of how the titles related to\nthe plot of the season.[45] In early October 2017, the Duffers revealed the\nfinal titles for the first six episodes of the season.[46]\n\nLevy noted in November 2016 that he and the Duffer Brothers had already begun\nplanning a potential third season, saying, \"We are not gonna be caught off\nguard and we don’t wanna be making stuff up like the day before we have to\nwrite it and make it, so we are definitely optimistic and we have started\nthinking ahead.\"[47] The Duffers anticipate having about four to five seasons\nto work with, but do want to \"have a really finite ending\" while the show is\nstill at a height of success, according to Matt, rather than letting it draw\nout indefinitely.[42] In August 2017, the Duffers confirmed there would be a\nthird season, with the likelihood of one more season following that, with Ross\nsaying, \"We're thinking it will be a four-season thing and then out\".[29]\n\n### Writing\n\nThe idea of _Stranger Things_ started with how the brothers felt they could\ntake the concept of the 2013 film _[Prisoners](/wiki/Prisoners_\\(2013_film\\)\n\"Prisoners \\(2013 film\\)\")_ , detailing the moral struggles a father goes\nthrough when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so\nhours in a serialized television approach. As they focused on the missing\nchild aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike\nsensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster\nthat could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these\nthings \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the\nnarrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place\nin the Cold War\" such as [Project MKUltra](/wiki/Project_MKUltra \"Project\nMKUltra\"), which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science\nrather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983\nas the time period, as it was a year before the film _[Red\nDawn](/wiki/Red_Dawn \"Red Dawn\")_ came out, which focused on Cold War\nparanoia.[30] Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal\ninspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the\nseries,[30][48] crafting it in the realm of [science\nfiction](/wiki/Science_fiction \"Science fiction\") and\n[horror](/wiki/Horror_fiction \"Horror fiction\").[49] The Duffer Brothers have\ncited as influence for the show (among others): [Stephen\nKing](/wiki/Stephen_King \"Stephen King\") novels; films produced by [Steven\nSpielberg](/wiki/Steven_Spielberg \"Steven Spielberg\"), [John\nCarpenter](/wiki/John_Carpenter \"John Carpenter\"), [Wes\nCraven](/wiki/Wes_Craven \"Wes Craven\"), [Robert\nZemeckis](/wiki/Robert_Zemeckis \"Robert Zemeckis\"), [George\nLucas](/wiki/George_Lucas \"George Lucas\") and [Guillermo del\nToro](/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro \"Guillermo del Toro\"); films such as\n_[Alien](/wiki/Alien_\\(film\\) \"Alien \\(film\\)\")_ and _[Stand by\nMe](/wiki/Stand_by_Me_\\(film\\) \"Stand by Me \\(film\\)\")_ ; Japanese\n[anime](/wiki/Anime \"Anime\") such as _[Akira](/wiki/Akira_\\(1988_film\\) \"Akira\n\\(1988 film\\)\")_ and _[Elfen Lied](/wiki/Elfen_Lied \"Elfen Lied\")_ ; and\n[video games](/wiki/Video_game \"Video game\") such as _[Silent\nHill](/wiki/Silent_Hill \"Silent Hill\")_ and _[The Last of\nUs](/wiki/The_Last_of_Us \"The Last of\nUs\")_.[37][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][_[excessive\ncitations](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Bundling_citations \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\")_] The Duffers also believe that they may have brought influences\nfrom other works unintentionally, including _[Beyond the Black\nRainbow](/wiki/Beyond_the_Black_Rainbow \"Beyond the Black Rainbow\")_ and\n_[D.A.R.Y.L.](/wiki/D.A.R.Y.L. \"D.A.R.Y.L.\")_ , discovered by reviewing fan\nfeedback on the show.[36]\n\nWith Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a\ntypical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach. They had\nbeen concerned that a 22-episode season on broadcast television would be\ndifficult to \"tell a cinematic story\" with that many episodes. Eight episodes\nallowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative\ndevelopment; if they had less time available, they would have had to remain\ncommitted to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and\nabandon the characterization.[31] Within the eight episodes, the brothers\naimed to make the first season \"feel like a big movie\" with all the major plot\nlines completed so that \"the audience feels satisfied\", but left enough\nunresolved to indicate \"there's a bigger mythology, and there's a lot of\ndangling threads at the end\", something that could be explored in further\nseasons if Netflix opted to create more.[58]\n\nRegarding writing for the children characters of the series, the Duffer\nBrothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students while in high\nschool and thus found it easy to write for Mike and his friends, and\nparticularly for Barb.[37] Joyce was fashioned after [Richard\nDreyfuss](/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss \"Richard Dreyfuss\")'s character Roy Neary in\n_[Close Encounters of the Third Kind](/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind\n\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\")_ , as she appears \"absolutely bonkers\"\nto everyone else as she tries to find Will.[59] Other characters, such as\nBilly in the second season, have more villainous attributes that are not\nnecessarily obvious from the onset; Matt explained that they took further\ninspiration from Stephen King for these characters, as King \"always has really\ngreat human villains\" that may be more malicious than the supernatural\nevil.[8]\n\n### Casting\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/David_Harbour_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/170px-\nDavid_Harbour_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg)](/wiki/File:David_Harbour_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:David_Harbour_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Duffers cast [David Harbour](/wiki/David_Harbour \"David Harbour\") as\nSheriff Hopper believing this was his opportunity to have a lead character in\na work.\n\nIn June 2015, it was announced that [Winona Ryder](/wiki/Winona_Ryder \"Winona\nRyder\") and [David Harbour](/wiki/David_Harbour \"David Harbour\") had joined\nthe series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively.[11] The\nbrothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of\nJoyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in\nthe films of the 1980s.[30] Levy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional\nurgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of [Joyce]\". Ryder\npraised that the show's multiple storylines required her to act for Joyce as\n\"she's out of her mind, but she's actually kind of onto something\", and that\nthe producers had faith she could pull off the difficult role.[60] The Duffer\nBrothers had been interested in Harbour before, who until _Stranger Things_\nprimarily had smaller roles as villainous characters, and they felt that he\nhad been \"waiting too long for this opportunity\" to play a lead, while Harbour\nhimself was thrilled by the script and the chance to play \"a broken, flawed,\nanti-hero character\".[37][61]\n\nAdditional casting followed two months later with [Finn\nWolfhard](/wiki/Finn_Wolfhard \"Finn Wolfhard\") as Mike, [Millie Bobby\nBrown](/wiki/Millie_Bobby_Brown \"Millie Bobby Brown\") in an undisclosed role,\n[Gaten Matarazzo](/wiki/Gaten_Matarazzo \"Gaten Matarazzo\") as Dustin, [Caleb\nMcLaughlin](/wiki/Caleb_McLaughlin \"Caleb McLaughlin\") as Lucas, [Natalia\nDyer](/wiki/Natalia_Dyer \"Natalia Dyer\") as Nancy, and [Charlie\nHeaton](/wiki/Charlie_Heaton \"Charlie Heaton\") as Jonathan.[12] In September\n2015, [Cara Buono](/wiki/Cara_Buono \"Cara Buono\") joined the cast as\nKaren,[13] followed by [Matthew Modine](/wiki/Matthew_Modine \"Matthew Modine\")\nas Martin Brenner a month later.[14] Additional cast who recur for the first\nseason include [Noah Schnapp](/wiki/Noah_Schnapp \"Noah Schnapp\") as\nWill,[12][16] [Shannon Purser](/wiki/Shannon_Purser \"Shannon Purser\") as\nBarbara \"Barb\" Holland,[19] [Joe Keery](/wiki/Joe_Keery \"Joe Keery\") as Steve\nHarrington,[17][16] and [Ross Partridge](/wiki/Ross_Partridge \"Ross\nPartridge\") as Lonnie,[26] among others.\n\nActors auditioning for the children roles read lines from _[Stand By\nMe](/wiki/Stand_By_Me_\\(film\\) \"Stand By Me \\(film\\)\")_.[30] The Duffer\nBrothers estimated they went through about a thousand different child actors\nfor the roles. They noted that Wolfhard was already \"a movie buff\" of the\nfilms from the 1980s period and easily filled the role, while they found\nMatarazzo's audition to be much more authentic than most of the other audition\ntapes, and selected him after a single viewing of his audition tape.[31] As\ncasting was started immediately after Netflix greenlit the show, and prior to\nthe scripts being fully completed, this allowed some of the actor's takes on\nthe roles to reflect into the script. The casting of the young actors for Will\nand his friends had been done just after the first script was completed, and\nsubsequent scripts incorporated aspects from these actors.[58] The brothers\nsaid Modine provided significant input on the character of Dr. Brenner, whom\nthey had not really fleshed out before as they considered him the hardest\ncharacter to write for given his limited appearances within the narrative.[59]\n\nIn October 2016, it was announced that Schnapp and Keery had been promoted to\nthe main cast for the second season, after each recurring in the first season,\nand that [Sadie Sink](/wiki/Sadie_Sink \"Sadie Sink\") and [Dacre\nMontgomery](/wiki/Dacre_Montgomery \"Dacre Montgomery\") would join the main\ncast as Max and Billy, respectively.[16] Ryder, Harbour, Wolfhard, Brown,\nMatarazzo, McLaughlin, Dyer and Heaton also return for the season.[62] [Sean\nAstin](/wiki/Sean_Astin \"Sean Astin\") as Bob Newby and [Paul\nReiser](/wiki/Paul_Reiser \"Paul Reiser\") as Sam Owens are also part of the\nmain cast in the season.[18] For Owens, the Duffer Brothers had referred to\nthe character in their pitch to Netflix for the season as \"Paul Reiser\", and\nspecifically alluded to Reiser's character Burke in\n_[Aliens](/wiki/Aliens_\\(film\\) \"Aliens \\(film\\)\")_ , with Ross referencing\n[James Cameron](/wiki/James_Cameron \"James Cameron\")'s casting choice for that\nfilm, saying, \"[Cameron] thought people would inherently trust [Reiser] and it\nwould be a twist\". Reiser's son was a fan of _Stranger Things_ , and gave his\nfather an early appreciation of the series, so that by when the production\ncalled his agent about the role, Reiser was excited for the part.[63] Joining\nthem in recurring roles are Linnea Berthelsen as Kali / Eight[23] and [Brett\nGelman](/wiki/Brett_Gelman \"Brett Gelman\") as Murray Bauman.[24]\n\n### Filming\n\nThe brothers had desired to film the series around the Long Island area to\nmatch the initial Montauk concept. However, with filming scheduled to take\nplace in November 2015, it was difficult to shoot in Long Island in the cold\nweather, and the production started scouting locations in and around the\n[Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta \"Atlanta\"), Georgia area. The brothers, who grew up in\nNorth Carolina, found many places that reminded them of their own childhoods\nin that area, and felt the area would work well with the narrative shift to\nthe fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.[36]\n\nThe filming of the first season began in November 2015 and was extensively\ndone in Atlanta, Georgia, with the Duffer Brothers and Levy handling the\ndirection of individual episodes.[64] [Jackson](/wiki/Jackson,_Georgia\n\"Jackson, Georgia\") served as the basis of the fictional town of Hawkins,\nIndiana.[65][66] Other shooting locations included the [Georgia Mental Health\nInstitute](/wiki/Georgia_Mental_Health_Institute \"Georgia Mental Health\nInstitute\") as the Hawkins National Laboratory site, [Bellwood\nQuarry](/wiki/Bellwood_Quarry \"Bellwood Quarry\"), [Patrick Henry High\nSchool](/wiki/Patrick_Henry_High_School_\\(Stockbridge,_Georgia\\) \"Patrick\nHenry High School \\(Stockbridge, Georgia\\)\") in [Stockbridge,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Stockbridge,_Georgia \"Stockbridge, Georgia\"), for the middle\nand high school scenes,[67] Emory University’s Continuing Education\nDepartment, the former city hall in [Douglasville,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Douglasville,_Georgia \"Douglasville, Georgia\"), [Georgia\nInternational Horse Park](/wiki/Georgia_International_Horse_Park \"Georgia\nInternational Horse Park\"), the probate court in [Butts County,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Butts_County,_Georgia \"Butts County, Georgia\"), Old East Point\nLibrary and East Point First Baptist Church in [East Point,\nGeorgia](/wiki/East_Point,_Georgia \"East Point, Georgia\"), [Fayetteville,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Fayetteville,_Georgia \"Fayetteville, Georgia\"), [Stone\nMountain](/wiki/Stone_Mountain \"Stone Mountain\") Park, [Palmetto,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Palmetto,_Georgia \"Palmetto, Georgia\"), and [Winston,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Winston,_Georgia \"Winston, Georgia\").[68] Set work was done at\nScreen Gem Studios in Atlanta.[68] The series was filmed with a\n[Red](/wiki/Red_Digital_Cinema_Camera_Company \"Red Digital Cinema Camera\nCompany\") Dragon digital camera.[59] Filming for the first season concluded in\nearly 2016.[65]\n\nWhile filming, the brothers tried to capture shots that could be seen as\nhomages to many of the 1980s references they recalled. Their goal was not\nnecessarily to fill the work with these references, but instead make the\nseries seem to the viewer as a 1980s film.[37] They spent little time\nreviewing those works and instead went by memory. Matt further recognized that\nsome of their filming homages were not purposely done but were found to be\nvery comparable, as highlighted by a fan-made video comparing the show to\nseveral 1980s works side-by-side.[30][69] Matt commented on the video that\n\"Some were deliberate and some were subconscious.\"[30] The brothers recognized\nthat many of the iconic scenes from these 1980s films, such as with\n_[Poltergeist](/wiki/Poltergeist_\\(1982_film\\) \"Poltergeist \\(1982 film\\)\")_ ,\nwas about \"taking a very ordinary object that people deal with every day,\ntheir television set, and imbuing it with something otherworldly\", leading to\nthe idea of using the Christmas light strings for Will to communicate with\nJoyce.[37]\n\nThe brothers attributed much of the 1980s feel to set and costume designers\nand the soundtrack composers that helped to recreate the era for them.[30]\nLynda Reiss, the head of props, had about a $220,000 budget, similar to most\nfilms, to acquire artifacts of the 1980s, using [eBay](/wiki/EBay \"EBay\") and\nsearching through flea markets and estate sales around the Atlanta area. The\nbulk of the props were original items from the 1980s with only a few pieces,\nsuch as the _Dungeons & Dragons_ books made as replicas.[70] Costume designer\nKimberly Adams-Galligan for the first season aimed for capturing authenticity\nof the clothes choices by the characters, such as reflecting that the Byers\nwould likely use hand-me-down clothes compared to the other families; in this\ncase, while the costume department did distress the outfits for all the\ncharacters, they spent more time for Will's clothes compared to Mike's.\nFrequently, they needed to create outfits for the kids themselves since many\nwere still growing during the time of filming, and could not readily acquire\nperiod fashion across a range of sizes.[71] Director of photography Tim Ives\nshot the first season with [Leica](/wiki/Leica_Camera \"Leica Camera\") lens and\nthe 6K [Red](/wiki/Red_Digital_Cinema_Camera_Company \"Red Digital Cinema\nCamera Company\") Scarlet Dragon to \"make sure that our images had the soft and\nround tones that are in '80s films\"; this is achieved through digital [image\nprocessing](/wiki/Image_processing \"Image processing\"). Ives said that these\ncameras allow them to create an adaptable quality to the recorded film that is\nadaptable to a wide range of viewing experiences, including support for newer\nand future television technologies such as [high dynamic\nrange](/wiki/High_dynamic_range \"High dynamic range\") video that was just\nbecoming adopted at the time of filming.[72]\n\nFilming for the second season began on November 7, 2016,[47] once again in and\naround the Atlanta Metro area.[73][74] While parts of Season 2 were set in\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, these were actually filmed in downtown Atlanta, with\nskylines of Pittsburgh added in post-production.[75] [Andrew\nStanton](/wiki/Andrew_Stanton \"Andrew Stanton\"), director of\n[Pixar](/wiki/Pixar \"Pixar\")'s _[Finding Nemo](/wiki/Finding_Nemo \"Finding\nNemo\")_ and _[WALL-E](/wiki/WALL-E \"WALL-E\")_ , will direct the fifth and\nsixth episode of the second season. Levy stated that Stanton was a big fan of\nthe show and called up Levy, offering his directorial abilities for the show.\n[Rebecca Thomas](/wiki/Rebecca_Thomas \"Rebecca Thomas\") will direct the\nseventh episode of the season.[76] Unlike the first season, which they were\nable to film without any real security issues, the heightened awareness of the\nshow required the producers to take significant steps to keep the show's\nproduction in secret while filming the second season. They spoke to the\nproduction team of [HBO](/wiki/HBO \"HBO\")'s _[Game of\nThrones](/wiki/Game_of_Thrones \"Game of Thrones\")_ for tips and advice for\nsecuring filming sites, and have adopted code names for the series and various\nparts to allow the actors to speak to others without revealing details of the\nshow's plot.[77] Kim Wilcox took over for costumes in the second season,\nfinding many of the same problems with designing for the child actors that\nwere aging. Furthermore, she wanted to create the 80's aestetic but as\nreflected in a small rural town, with the trends of period slowly filtering\ninto it rather that immediately jump on elements like neon colors.[71] The\nsecond season concluded filming on June 2, 2017.[78] Ives once again used\nLeica lens to film the season, while upgrading to the Red Weapon 8K S35\ncamera.[72]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nTo create the aged effect for the series, a [film grain](/wiki/Film_grain\n\"Film grain\") was added over the footage, which was captured by scanning in\nfilm stock from the 1980s.[59] The Duffers wanted to scare the audience, but\nnot to necessarily make the show violent or gory, following in line with how\nthe 1980s [Amblin Entertainment](/wiki/Amblin_Entertainment \"Amblin\nEntertainment\") films drove the creation of the [PG-13 movie\nrating](/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#Addition_of_PG-13_rating\n\"Motion Picture Association of America film rating system\"). It was \"much more\nabout mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\",\nthough they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly\ntowards the end of the first season.[59] The brothers had wanted to avoid any\n[computer-generated effects](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-\ngenerated imagery\") for the monster and other parts of the series and stay\nwith [practical effects](/wiki/Practical_effect \"Practical effect\"). However,\nthe six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test\npractical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground\nof using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could,\nbut for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they\nopted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was\ncompleted the week before it was released to Netflix.[30]\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the _Stranger Things_ title\nwith a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the\ntitle. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part\nof [R/GA](/wiki/R/GA \"R/GA\"), led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.[79]\nLevy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision\nof the 1980s-inspired show, which helped the studio to fix the concept the\nproducers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary\nForces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as\nwell as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used\nto establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach\nfor the show's titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took\ninspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were\npreviously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as _[Altered\nStates](/wiki/Altered_States \"Altered States\")_ and _[The Dead\nZone](/wiki/The_Dead_Zone_\\(film\\) \"The Dead Zone \\(film\\)\")_. They also got\ninput from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films.\nVarious iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\"\ntheme of the show, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the\nmysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working\non the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the\nfilming process to let the producers get immersed in the show and come back\nwith more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the\ntitle and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end\nthe producers wanted to work with [ITC Benguiat](/wiki/ITC_Benguiat \"ITC\nBenguiat\"), requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully\ncomputer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical\neffects, such as using\n[Kodalith](/w/index.php?title=Kodalith&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kodalith \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the\nappropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title\ncards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film\n_[Bullitt](/wiki/Bullitt \"Bullitt\")_ , which the producers had suggested to\nthe studio.[80]\n\n### Music\n\nMain article: [Music of Stranger Things](/wiki/Music_of_Stranger_Things \"Music\nof Stranger Things\")\n\nThe _Stranger Things_ original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and\nKyle Dixon of the electronic band [Survive](/wiki/Survive_\\(band\\) \"Survive\n\\(band\\)\").[81] It makes extensive use of [synthesizers](/wiki/Synthesizer\n\"Synthesizer\") in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [Jean-\nMichel Jarre](/wiki/Jean-Michel_Jarre \"Jean-Michel Jarre\"), [Tangerine\nDream](/wiki/Tangerine_Dream \"Tangerine Dream\"), [Vangelis](/wiki/Vangelis\n\"Vangelis\"), [Goblin](/wiki/Goblin_\\(band\\) \"Goblin \\(band\\)\"), [John\nCarpenter](/wiki/John_Carpenter \"John Carpenter\"), [Giorgio\nMoroder](/wiki/Giorgio_Moroder \"Giorgio Moroder\"), and [Fabio\nFrizzi](/wiki/Fabio_Frizzi \"Fabio Frizzi\").[82]\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's\nmusic, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell\nthe show to Netflix.[81][83] Once the show was green-lit, the Duffers\ncontacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music; the\ntwo provided the production team with dozens of songs from their band's past\nto gain their interest, helping to land them the role.[81] Once aboard, the\ntwo worked with producers to select some of their older music to rework for\nthe show, while developing new music, principally with character motifs.[83]\nThe two had been hired before the casting process, so their motif\n[demos](/wiki/Demo_\\(music\\) \"Demo \\(music\\)\") were used and played over the\nactors' audition tapes, aiding in the casting selection.[83][84] The show's\ntheme is based on an unused work Stein composed much earlier that ended up in\nthe library of work they shared with the production staff, who thought that\nwith some reworking would be good for the opening credits.[81]\n\nIn addition to original music, _Stranger Things_ features period music from\nartists including [The Clash](/wiki/The_Clash \"The Clash\"), [Joy\nDivision](/wiki/Joy_Division \"Joy Division\"), [Toto](/wiki/Toto_\\(band\\) \"Toto\n\\(band\\)\"), [New Order](/wiki/New_Order_\\(band\\) \"New Order \\(band\\)\"), [The\nBangles](/wiki/The_Bangles \"The Bangles\"),\n[Foreigner](/wiki/Foreigner_\\(band\\) \"Foreigner \\(band\\)\"), [Echo and the\nBunnymen](/wiki/Echo_and_the_Bunnymen \"Echo and the Bunnymen\"), [Peter\nGabriel](/wiki/Peter_Gabriel \"Peter Gabriel\"), and [Corey\nHart](/wiki/Corey_Hart_\\(singer\\) \"Corey Hart \\(singer\\)\"), as well as\nexcerpts from Tangerine Dream, John Carpenter, and Vangelis.[85][86] In\nparticular, The Clash's \"[Should I Stay or Should I\nGo](/wiki/Should_I_Stay_or_Should_I_Go \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\")\" was\nspecifically picked to play at pivotal moments of the story, such as when Will\nis trying to communicate with Joyce from the Upside Down.[86]\n\n#### Soundtracks\n\n_Stranger Things_ 's original soundtrack, consisting of 75 songs from Stein\nand Dixon split across two volumes, was released by [Lakeshore\nRecords](/wiki/Lakeshore_Records \"Lakeshore Records\"). Digital release and\nstreaming options were released on August 10 and 19, 2016 for the two volumes,\nrespectively, while retail versions were available on September 16 and 23,\n2016.[87][86] Limited editions of the soundtrack on vinyl, in both individual\nand a boxed set, are set for release in July 2017.[88] A cassette version of\nthe soundtrack, sold exclusively by [Urban Outfitters](/wiki/Urban_Outfitters\n\"Urban Outfitters\"), was released on July 14, 2017. The cassette packaging\nfeatures a cardboard cover that emulates an old [VHS](/wiki/VHS \"VHS\")\nsleeves, while the cassette case is made to look like a VHS tape.[89]\n\nBoth volumes were nominated individually for the [Best Score Soundtrack\nCategory](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Score_Soundtrack_for_Visual_Media\n\"Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media\") for the 2017\n[Grammy Awards](/wiki/Grammy_Awards \"Grammy Awards\"), though neither won.[90]\n\nThe soundtrack for the second season of _Stranger Things_ was released\ndigitally on October 20, 2017. The soundtrack, once again composed by Stein\nand Dixon, consists of 34 songs and was released by Lakeshore Records in the\nUnited States and Invada Records internationally. The soundtrack is intended\nto be released on physical formats, such as compact disc, vinyl, and cassette\nas well.[91] On the soundtrack's composition, Stein and Dixon together said\nthat the score for the season introduces \"new styles of composition, while\nstill revisiting old themes when appropriate ... We've created new elements\nthat are necessary to support the story, but still want to remain true to the\nsound of Season 1.\" The first track from the soundtrack, \"Walkin' in Hawkins\",\nwas released on October 12.[92]\n\n## Release\n\nThe first season consisted of eight one-hour-long episodes which were released\nworldwide on Netflix on July 15, 2016,[93] in [Ultra HD](/wiki/Ultra-high-\ndefinition_television \"Ultra-high-definition television\")\n[4K](/wiki/4K_resolution \"4K resolution\").

According to Symphony, within the first 35 days of release,\n_Stranger Things_ averaged ratings around 14.07 million adults between the\nages 18–49 in the United States. This made it the third most-watched season of\nNetflix original content in the U.S. at the time behind the first season of\n_[Fuller House](/wiki/Fuller_House_\\(TV_series\\) \"Fuller House \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ and [fourth season](/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black_\\(season_4\\)\n\"Orange Is the New Black \\(season 4\\)\") of _[Orange Is the New\nBlack](/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black \"Orange Is the New Black\")_.[99] In a\nSeptember 2016 analysis, Netflix found that _Stranger Things_ \"hooked\" viewers\nby the second episode of the first season, indicating that the second episode\nwas \"the first installment that led at least 70 percent of viewers who watched\nthat episode to complete the entire first season of a show.\"[100]\n\nIn August 2017, the marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season\nwas the seventh-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it\npremiered, garnering slightly more than 20% of the viewers that the [second\nseason](/wiki/Daredevil_\\(season_2\\) \"Daredevil \\(season 2\\)\") of\n_[Daredevil](/wiki/Daredevil_\\(TV_series\\) \"Daredevil \\(TV series\\)\")_\nreceived, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot,\nwhich \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100\nmillion consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the\ncompany’s U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix\nviewers who watched at least one episode of the season.[101]\n\n### Critical reception\n\n#### Season 1\n\nSeason | Critical response  \n---|---  \n[Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\") | [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\")  \n| 1 | 96% (68 reviews) | 76 (34 reviews)  \n| 2 | 94% (104 reviews) | 78 (32 reviews)  \n  \n[Review aggregator](/wiki/Review_aggregator \"Review aggregator\") [Rotten\nTomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\") gave the first season an\napproval rating of 96% based on 68 reviews, and a [weighted\naverage](/wiki/Weighted_average \"Weighted average\") rating of 8.04/10.

It\nfeels like watching a show produced during the era in which it’s set, but with\nthe craft of today’s prestige television.\"[106] Reviewing for\n_[HitFix](/wiki/HitFix \"HitFix\")_ , [Alan Sepinwall](/wiki/Alan_Sepinwall\n\"Alan Sepinwall\") said, \"Over the course of the eight hours, the story and\ncharacters take on enough life of their own so that the references don't feel\nself-indulgent, and so that the series can be appreciated even if you don't\nknow the plot of E.T. or the title font of Stephen King's early novels (a huge\ninfluence on the show's own opening credits) by heart.\"[107]\n\n[Emily Nussbaum](/wiki/Emily_Nussbaum \"Emily Nussbaum\") of _[The New\nYorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker \"The New Yorker\")_ also applauded the series and\nwrote, \"This is astoundingly efficient storytelling, eight hours that pass in\na blink, with even minor characters getting sharp dialogue, dark humor, or\nmoments of pathos.\"[108] Television critic [Mary McNamara](/wiki/Mary_McNamara\n\"Mary McNamara\") of _[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles\nTimes\")_ said, \"For the most part, and in absolute defiance of the odds,\n_Stranger Things_ honors its source material in the best way possible: By\ntelling a sweet 'n' scary story in which monsters are real but so are the\ntransformative powers of love and fealty.\"[109] _[The Wall Street\nJournal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\")_ 's [Brian\nKelly](/wiki/Brian_Kelly_\\(actor\\) \"Brian Kelly \\(actor\\)\") said, \"Matt Duffer\nand Ross Duffer, brothers and the show’s creators, have done their homework\nwhen it comes to ’80s cinema. Whether you’re a fan of John Carpenter’s _The\nThing_ or _The Goonies_ is more your speed, there’s plenty to like in\n_Stranger Things_.\"[110]\n\nIn a negative review, cultural critic Grafton Tanner called the series \"wish\nfulfillment\" and \"a window through which the present-shocked can gaze at a\nclichéd past.\"[111] Similarly, Marinna Guzy of The Establishment wrote: \"When\nconfronted with a story like Stranger Things, a recycled retelling of an old\nstory being marketed as homage and good, clean nostalgia, one has to wonder\nwhether or not studios and content creators like the Duffer Brothers ever ask\nthemselves whether or not the story they are telling is the one that should be\ntold. What purpose does Stranger Things serve beyond reinforcing the status\nquo in the media landscape and perpetuating the dangerous delusion that things\nwere better way back when?\"[112]\n\n#### Season 2\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the second season has an approval rating of 94% based on\n104 reviews, and an average rating of 7.79/10. The site's critical consensus\nstates, \"_Stranger Things_ ' slow-building sophomore season balances moments\nof humor and a nostalgic sweetness against a growing horror that's all the\nmore effective thanks to the show's full-bodied characters and evocative\ntone.\"[113] On Metacritic, the second season has a normalized score of 78 out\nof 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[114]\n\n### Commentary\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Shannon_Purser_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/170px-\nShannon_Purser_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg)](/wiki/File:Shannon_Purser_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Shannon_Purser_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nShannon Purser's performance as Barb received a great deal of attention from\nfans, and led to her being nominated for [Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama\nSeries](/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Guest_Actress_in_a_Drama_Series\n\"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series\").\n\nShortly after its release, _Stranger Things_ gained a dedicated fanbase. One\narea of focus from these fans was the character of Barb, the nerdy friend and\nclassmate of Nancy who is taken and killed by the monster early in the\nseason.[115] According to actress [Shannon Purser](/wiki/Shannon_Purser\n\"Shannon Purser\"), Barb \"wasn’t supposed to be a big deal\", and the Duffer\nBrothers had not gone into great detail about the character since the focus\nwas on finding Will. However, many fans sympathized with the character, with\nLaura Bradley of _[Vanity Fair](/wiki/Vanity_Fair_\\(magazine\\) \"Vanity Fair\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ suggesting that these people found that Barb would be a\nsimilar misfit in society, and \"looks more like someone you might actually\nmeet in real life\" compared to the other characters, particularly Nancy, in\nthe series. A [hashtag](/wiki/Hashtag \"Hashtag\") \"#ImWithBarb\" grew in\npopularity after the series' release, and several fan sites and forums were\ncreated to support her.[116] While Purser will not return for the second\nseason, the Duffer Brothers used the real-life \"Justice for Barb\" movement as\ninspiration for narrative at the start of the second season, with Nancy\naddressing the fact \"that no one ever cares about\" Barb.[9] Purser and several\nmedia outlets took her nomination as Barb for [Outstanding Guest Actress in a\nDrama\nSeries](/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Guest_Actress_in_a_Drama_Series\n\"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series\") in the\n[69th Primetime Emmy Awards](/wiki/69th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards \"69th Primetime\nEmmy Awards\") as achieving \"justice for Barb\", highlighting how well her\ncharacter was received.[117][118][119]\n\nAnother impact of the series has been an increase demand for [Eggo](/wiki/Eggo\n\"Eggo\") waffles, as they are shown to be Eleven's favorite food in several\nepisodes and are seen as a representation of the show.[120] The [Kellogg\nCompany](/wiki/Kellogg_Company \"Kellogg Company\"), which manufactures Eggo,\nhad not been part of the production prior to the first season's release, but\nrecognized the market impact of the series. It provided a vintage 1980s Eggo\ntelevision advertisement for Netflix to use in its [Super Bowl\nLI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_LI \"Super Bowl LI\") commercial, and is looking to become\nmore involved with cross-promotion.[121]\n\n### Accolades\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Split-arrows.svg/50px-Split-arrows.svg.png) |  It has been suggested that this section be [split](/wiki/Wikipedia:Splitting \"Wikipedia:Splitting\") out into another article.

The game uses a [retro-pixel](/wiki/Pixel_art\n\"Pixel art\") style of art, similar to games for the [Super Nintendo\nEntertainment System](/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System \"Super\nNintendo Entertainment System\"). The game is loosely based on the _Stranger\nThings_ story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police\nJim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they\nbecome playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access\nmore areas in the game.[162][163] BonusXP had less than a year to complete the\ngame. The team decided to make the game in a similar style to _[The Legend of\nZelda](/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda \"The Legend of Zelda\")_ because it \"was a\nperfect match because both [_Stranger Things_ and _Zelda_] are about\nexploration, and it's kind of a mysterious fit that fit the mood of the show,\"\naccording to BonusXP president Dave Pottinger.
