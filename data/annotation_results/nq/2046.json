Although the society has more\nthan 50 flats, the show revolves around the lives of eight families:\n\n  * Jethalal Champaklal Gada, an electronics shop-owner from [Kachchh district](/wiki/Kachchh_district \"Kachchh district\"), [Gujarat](/wiki/Gujarat \"Gujarat\"), and his wife Daya, father Champaklal Jayantilal Gada and son Tipendra (Tapu). Residents of B Wing.\n  * The narrator, Taarak Mehta, a column-writer and his wife Anjali, a disciplined dietician who are from Gujarat]]. Residents of B Wing.\n  * The society's secretary, Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide, a home tutor from [Ratnagiri](/wiki/Ratnagiri \"Ratnagiri\"), [Maharashtra](/wiki/Maharashtra \"Maharashtra\"), his wife Madhavi, a business woman and daughter Sonalika (Sonu). Residents of A Wing.\n  * Dr. Hansraj Hathi, the resident doctor from [Uttar Pradesh](/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh \"Uttar Pradesh\"), his wife Komal and son Gulabkumar (Goli). Residents of A Wing.\n  * Roshan Singh Sodhi, a car mechanic from [Amritsar](/wiki/Amritsar \"Amritsar\"), [Punjab](/wiki/Punjab \"Punjab\") and his [Parsi](/wiki/Parsi \"Parsi\") wife, also named Roshan and their son Gurucharan (Gogi). Residents of A Wing.\n  * Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer, a Tamil scientist from [Chennai](/wiki/Chennai \"Chennai\"), [Tamil Nadu](/wiki/Tamil_Nadu \"Tamil Nadu\") and his Bengali wife Babita from [Kolkata](/wiki/Kolkata \"Kolkata\"), [West Bengal](/wiki/West_Bengal \"West Bengal\"). Residents of C Wing.\n  * Popatlal Pandey, a newspaper journalist working for Toofan Express and from [Bhopal](/wiki/Bhopal \"Bhopal\"), [Madhya Pradesh](/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh \"Madhya Pradesh\"). Residents of C Wing.\n  * Pankaj Diwan Sahay also called Pinku, part of the Tapu sena and resides in another society(gulmohar apartments)\n\nThere are also other recurring characters including Sundarlal (brother of\nJethalal's wife Daya, from [Ahmedabad](/wiki/Ahmedabad \"Ahmedabad\"),\n[Gujarat](/wiki/Gujarat \"Gujarat\"))and his friends. Abdul, the shopkeeper of\nthe provisions store located outside the society entrance, reporter Rita\nShrivastav from 'Kal Tak' a news channel, Inspector Chalu Pandey, [Asit Kumarr\nModi](/wiki/Asit_Kumarr_Modi \"Asit Kumarr Modi\") as himself, Jethalal's shop\nassistants - Natwarlal Prabhashankar Udhaiwala (Natu Kaka) and his nephew\nBaagheshwar Dadu Udhaiwala (Baagha), who are often bent on doing the wrong\njob, and Baagha's fiancée Bawri Dhondulal Kanpuria.\n\nThe members of the society and other characters have a good psychological bond\nof love and sympathy for one another that makes them live like members of one\nfamily. They are often seen celebrating festivals and participating in events\ntogether. Although they are shown to live the lives of typical Indian\nfamilies, the characters, more often than not Jethalal Gada, tend to find\nthemselves in trouble, cropping up from routine activities that intensify in a\ncomical manner.\n\nThe quirks of the individual characters seek to enhance the humour quotient of\nthe show. Whatever the nature of the problem that a member of the society\nencounters, all the other members stand by them to extend every possible help.\nIn an episode, the resolution of the problem that a character faces is usually\nfollowed by a moral message at the end by Taarak Mehta, which is meant for all\nthe characters of the show as well as the viewers.\n\n### The Tapu\nSena[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Taarak_Mehta_Ka_Ooltah_Chashmah&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: The Tapu Sena\")]\n\nThe Tapu Sena is a five-member group of children residing in Gokuldham\nSociety: Tapu (the leader of Tapu Sena), Goli, Gogi, Pinku and Sonu. These\nchildren have played significant roles, providing a fun young tone to the\nshow. Usually, the group becomes a nuisance for the other members of the\nsociety because of their mischief, while at other times, it draws praises from\nthe members by doing something laudable. The society secretary, Atmaram\nTukaram Bhide is especially annoyed with the Tapu Sena for playing cricket in\nthe society compound as sometimes they break the window glasses, or just cause\na problem as shown in some episodes. Since the beginning of the show, the Tapu\nSena has, with their childlike activities, characterized the typical\nfrolicsome Indian children. As the children grow up and mature, the stories\nare tailored to suit their ages.[3][4]\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Taarak_Mehta_Ka_Ooltah_Chashmah&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section:
