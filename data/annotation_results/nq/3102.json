The Robinsons' craft,\n_Jupiter 2_ , crashes into a glacial bed. The family evacuates with some\nsupplies before their craft sinks in rapidly freezing water. Eldest Robinson\nchild, Judy, a doctor, dives to the ship to retrieve power equipment. She\nbecomes encased in ice, and with five hours of oxygen left in Judy's suit,\nJohn and son, Will, set out to collect magnesium that will melt the ice. Judy\nguides her sister, Penny, through a medical procedure to treat their injured\nmother, Maureen. Inside a cave, Will falls down a chasm, landing at the edge\nof a forest. John radios Will, saying he will return after saving Judy. Alone,\nWill finds a crashed alien ship and a dismembered robot that he helps to self-\nrepair. In return, it saves Will as a forest fire nearly engulfs them. The\nfamily attempt to free Judy, but a sudden rainstorm hinders their progress.\nWill and the Robot arrive, and the Robot rescues Judy. In a flashback scene, a\nwoman steals the identity of Dr. Zachary Smith and boards a Jupiter landing\ncraft, along with Don West and Tam Roughneck.  \n2 | \"Diamonds In The Sky\" | Neil Marshall | Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless | April 13, 2018 (2018-04-13)  \nDon West, Smith, and Debbie the chicken survive the _Jupiter 18_ landing.\nWhile looking for other survivors, they find Angela Goddard, who is barely\nalive. When a storm approaches, Don and Angela take cover while Smith heads\nout. Meanwhile, the robot melts more ice to allow the Robinsons to start the\nprocess of recovering the _Jupiter 2_. Maureen, John, Will and the robot hike\nto another Jupiter crash site and then later to the robot's ship. They leave\nPenny and Judy behind, instructing them how to carefully raise the ship out of\nthe ice. Inside the alien ship, a holographic map of the planet is activated,\nshowing John and Maureen they are in an unidentified galaxy. Outside, the\nrobot touches the ship's hull, creating a mental connection to Will who learns\nwhat really happened on the Resolute. He decides to say nothing to his parents\nabout the vision. When Penny sees the storm approaching and is unable to reach\nher parents to warn them, she raises the _Jupiter 2_ enough that the garage\ncan be opened. She drives the ship's _Chariot_ all-terrain vehicle to reach\nher family just in front of the storm. As they head back to _Jupiter 2_ , they\npass Don who sees them only to discover his flare gun is missing. The\nRobinsons see a flare and find Smith, who claims to be alone, returning with\nher to the _Jupiter 2_.  \n3 | \"Infestation\" | [Tim Southam](/wiki/Tim_Southam \"Tim Southam\") | [Zack Estrin](/wiki/Zack_Estrin \"Zack Estrin\") | April 13, 2018 (2018-04-13)  \nIn a flashback, Dr. Smith is revealed to be June Harris, the older, ex-con\nsister of Jess Harris, a successful businesswoman. Jess offers June her entire\nestate as she is leaving Earth, but June drugs Jess and assumes her sister's\nidentity. Aboard the _Resolute_ , she bumps into her sister's lover and there\nis a struggle ending in him getting blown out an airlock. June is arrested but\nescapes during the robot's attack. In the present, Maureen explains they are\ntrillions of light years from Earth. At night, the ice layer over _Jupiter 2_\ncracks, endangering the ship. They rush to complete repairs, but the engines\nare losing fuel. When Will and the robot discover large eel-like creatures in\nthe conduits, the robot locks Will, along with Smith, in the storeroom for\nsafety. The glacier shifts, which forces the crew to make an emergency take-\noff after flushing the eels from the engines. They escape with just enough\nfuel to land near a forest region. Comms pick up radio communication from\nother Jupiter survivors and also from _Resolute_ , who are searching for\nsurvivors. Somebody hacks the onboard 3D printer to make a gun. Will finds it,\nand hides the gun under his mattress, unaware Smith is watching.  \n4 | \"The Robinsons Were Here\" | [Alice Troughton](/wiki/Alice_Troughton \"Alice Troughton\") | [Katherine Collins](/wiki/Katherine_Collins \"Katherine Collins\") | April 13, 2018 (2018-04-13)  \nStuck without fuel, the family initiates _Jupiter 2’s_ colonization expansion\nprotocol. Smith and Will discuss the robot, who does Will's bidding. Don West\nand Angela are rescued by the Watanabe family; Hiroki Watanabe reunites with\nJohn and Maureen at _Jupiter 11_ where Judy treats Angela. She tells Judy\nabout the attack on _Resolute_. The Robinsons learn none of the other\nsurviving families can fly due to the giant eels consuming fuel. John notices\nthat one crash site is not a _Jupiter_ ship. Maureen, John, and Don go there\nand discover the _Resolute_ 's comm dish. They realize the _Resolute_ can't\nhear them. Maureen also discovers contraband whiskey that Don smuggled aboard.\nJudy confronts Will about the robot, and he reveals he knew it attacked the\n_Resolute_. They decide to hide the robot in a nearby cave, unaware Smith is\nfollowing them. On the way, they're spotted by Vijay Dhar, the son of another\nsurvivor group. Penny blackmails him to say nothing about the robot, having\nfound and keeping an item he dropped. While away, Maureen and John discuss\ntheir marital problems. The next morning, the kids return to _Jupiter 2_\nbefore their parents arrive. Smith talks to the robot inside the cave,\nattempting to instill distrust in it about Will. When John and Maureen return\nhome, the kids tell them that the robot wandered away.  \n5 | \"Transmission\" | [Deborah Chow](/wiki/Deborah_Chow \"Deborah Chow\") | Kari Drake | April 13, 2018 (2018-04-13)  \nThe surviving colonists build a light tower to try to signal the _Resolute_.\nMaureen, noticing strange weather phenomena, conducts an experiment using a\nweather balloon. She discovers the sun is paired with a deadly black hole, and\nthat the disturbances will only get worse until the planet is entirely\nunhabitable. Will ignores Penny and Judy's advice to tell their father about\nthe Robot. Penny develops a crush on Vijay, flirting with him as they move\nsupplies. Don confronts Dr. Smith about the stolen flare gun, though she\nclaims she took it by mistake. In a flashback, Maureen and the kids discuss\npros versus cons of going to Alpha Centauri. Judy and Don discuss his\nsmuggling activities. He also reveals his suspicions about Dr. Smith's\nidentity. Judy confronts Dr. Smith about this, but she lies and instead casts\ndoubt on Don. When the colonists activate the light signal, Dr. Smith sneaks\naway and shuts off the perimeter fence, allowing a large reptilian creature to\nenter the camp and destroy the light tower. Smith tells John about the kids\nhiding the robot. When another creature shows up, Dr. Smith tells Will to call\nthe robot. It does save the survivors, but only after Will tells it to defend\nitself against the creatures. It assumes its original multi-limb form to do\nthis. The colonists witness all of this and recognize the robot from the\nattack on the _Resolute_.  \n6 | \"Eulogy\" | [Vincenzo Natali](/wiki/Vincenzo_Natali \"Vincenzo Natali\") | Ed McCardie | April 13, 2018 (2018-04-13)  \nMaureen tells her family about the black hole but is afraid the other\ncolonists might panic. John has a heated argument with the other survivors\nabout the robot. In the end, despite an enraged Angela claiming it killed her\nhusband, John convinces the community to allow the robot to stay and takes\nWill on a hike to discuss Will's responsibility for the robot's actions. He\nhas Will fetch 27 large stones to build a memorial to the casualties. Don\ntakes the community leader and Vijay's father, Victor Dhar, to his _Jupiter_\nwhich crashed in the desert where there are none of the eel-like creatures,\nand wants money for its fuel. Don also retrieves identification of the real\nDr. Smith, later showing Judy. Maureen learns that Hiroki also knows the\nplanet is dying. Penny tells Vijay about the black hole but swears him to\nsecrecy, and they share a kiss. Back at camp, Dr. Smith makes the distraught\nAngela recount the horrifying details of the robot attack. The emotional\nAngela enters the hub with the gun Dr. Smith has taken from Will's bunk and\narranged for her to find. When she shoots at the robot it goes into attack\nmode and accidentally injures John before Will gets it to stop. Distraught,\nWill takes the robot to a cliff and orders it to walk off. He then places a\nstone on the memorial for the robot.  \n7 | \"Pressurized\" | Tim Southam | Vivian Lee | April 13, 2018 (2018-04-13)  \nWhile driving back to _Jupiter 2_ , Judy is about to tell Dr. Smith she knows\nthe truth about her when Don stops her. When Will is confronted by his mother,\nhe confirms the robot 3D-printed the gun and that he hid it. Anyone could've\ntaken the gun, though. Dr. Smith refuses blame for Angela's attack, and\nsuggests Victor Dhar might have taken the gun. John and Maureen's rover gets\nstuck in a tar pit. As they sink to the bottom, Maureen admits to doctoring\nWill's test results. To escape the vehicle, Maureen uses the helium weather\nballoon to create a shielded path to the surface. Meanwhile, Smith locates the\ndestroyed robot, but cannot get it to reassemble. Don's group speeds through a\ndangerous geyser field but a tube shakes loose and when Evan fixes the\nproblem, a geyser blast flips the tanker on top of him. Victor realizes that a\nrock has punctured the tanker and if they move it they'll lose most of the\nfuel. Despite this Don reluctantly sides with Judy and lifts the tanker,\nspilling the fuel, but Evan dies anyway. Back on _Jupiter 2_ , Dr. Smith\nfinally manages to reactivate the robot. When Victor returns home, Vijay tells\nhim about the planet's coming demise. Victor decides to use what fuel they did\nretrieve to launch their own _Jupiter 4_.  \n8 | \"Trajectory\" | [Stephen Surjik](/wiki/Stephen_Surjik \"Stephen Surjik\") | Katherine Collins & Kari Drake | April 13, 2018 (2018-04-13)  \nMaureen can't talk Victor out of launching, but John sneaks aboard the Dhar's\n_Jupiter 4_ and triggers the emergency shut down. Later, he explains to the\ngathered colonists how the planet is about to become inhabitable. Penny breaks\noff with Vijay for him telling his father. Maureen has a plan on how to launch\ndespite the limited fuel, stripping out non-essential modules, and relying on\nold-school manual piloting. Judy tells Maureen the truth about the real Dr.\nSmith aboard Don's _Jupiter_. Returning to _Jupiter 2_ , Maureen confines Dr.\nSmith to a holding cell. Dr. Smith now claims she is really Jessica Harris, a\nphysicist. Maureen tells John about Smith, and he tells her that Don believes\nthe _Jupiter 4_ is still too heavy to take off. With life support also\nremoved, the pilot now needs a spacesuit and will need to withstand extreme\nG-forces. They select John, but not even he can regain consciousness fast\nenough to make all the maneuvers alone. When the _Resolute_ sends a message\nthat due to Hawking radiation they must leave the planet's orbit within 24\nhours, Don reluctantly agrees to help pilot the ship. With his assistance the\ntest run is a success. As John and Don launch in the _Jupiter 4_ , Dr. Smith\ntricks Will and escapes to knock out Maureen right when John needs her\ninstructions. With everyone watching, the ship explodes mid-air and John and\nDon are presumed dead.  \n9 | \"Resurrection\" | Tim Southam | _Story by_ : Daniel McLellan  \n_Teleplay by_ : Kari Drake | April 13, 2018 (2018-04-13)  \nWill tries to signal his father using simple radio, convinced he survived the\nexplosion. Dr. Smith drives herself and Maureen to the alien wreck, and tells\nMaureen she didn't know Maureen was needed for the ship launch, and when she\nknocked her out, the ship exploded. She does promise helping Maureen get her\nkids off the planet, if she in return helps Dr. Smith with the alien ship.\nWill discovers that the rocks he collected in the cave are petrified biomass\nthat can fuel the _Jupiter_ ships to reach the _Resolute_. While the colonists\ngather to harvest the biomass, Judy leaves to find Maureen. The colonists find\nenough biomass to power all the _Jupiters_ , but they must sneak it out\nquietly to not wake winged predators roosting in the cave. When John manages\nto send a signal, Penny and others are trapped inside when the blind creatures\nwake up Throughout the episode, flashbacks reveal the Christmas Star not to be\na meteor but an alien craft, and that its engine was used to build _The\nResolute_. The robot's attack was an attempt to retrieve the stolen engine.\nThe group trapped in the cave manage to narrowly escape. Judy uses GPS to\ntrack Smith and Maureen. She manages to disable Dr. Smith, but the robot\nreactivates and is revealed to obey the Doctor's commands.  \n10 | \"Danger, Will Robinson\" | [David Nutter](/wiki/David_Nutter \"David Nutter\") | Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless | April 13, 2018 (2018-04-13)  \nJohn and Don survived the explosion and are clinging to ship wreckage in\norbit, with only a few hours of oxygen left. Will is upset to learn the robot\nnow serves Dr. Smith. John responds to Will, confirming that he and Don are\nstill alive. Will tries to bond with the robot again but is rejected. Victor\nDhar hails them from the _Resolute_ , telling them it will leave in just over\nan hour. Maureen traps Dr Smith and the robot in order to search for John and\nDon. Just as they're about to retrieve them, Dr Smith and the robot escape.\nMaureen leads the robot into the garage, as an alien ship arrives to retrieve\nthe engine. When the alien robot is about to kill Will, his robot remembers\nhim and attacks the alien robot, saving Will. In the fight, both robots are\nflung out into space and the garage ramp is damaged. Will goes outside the\nhull to manually close the hatch. Afterwards, he loses his grip but is saved\nby his father, who was rescued by Dr. Smith. With everyone safely back on the\n_Jupiter_ , Maureen is grateful to Dr. Smith, but still locks her up. Before\nthey can dock with the _Resolute_ , the alien engine aboard the _Jupiter 2_\nsends it and the Robinsons to a different galaxy. Will recognizes its shape\nfrom the robot's sand drawing: Danger.  \n  \n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lost_in_Space_\\(2018_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lost_in_Space_\\(2018_TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nIn October 2014, it was announced that [Legendary\nTelevision](/wiki/Legendary_Entertainment \"Legendary Entertainment\") and\n[Synthesis\nEntertainment](/w/index.php?title=Synthesis_Entertainment&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Synthesis Entertainment \\(page does not exist\\)\") were developing a new\nreboot of _[Lost in Space](/wiki/Lost_in_Space \"Lost in Space\")_ and had hired\nscreenwriting duo [Matt Sazama and Burk\nSharpless](/wiki/Matt_Sazama_and_Burk_Sharpless \"Matt Sazama and Burk\nSharpless\") to pen the pilot episodes.[14] In November 2015,\n[Netflix](/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\") landed the project.[15][16] On June 29,\n2016, Netflix ordered a full 10 episode season of _Lost in Space_ , with [Zack\nEstrin](/wiki/Zack_Estrin \"Zack Estrin\") as executive producer and\n[showrunner](/wiki/Showrunner \"Showrunner\").
