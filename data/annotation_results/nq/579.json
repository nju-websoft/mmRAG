In the years since, it has become an enduring classic. It was the most\nplayed song in the last 75 years in public places in the UK (as of 2009),[7]\nand the United Kingdom performing rights group [Phonographic Performance\nLimited](/wiki/Phonographic_Performance_Limited \"Phonographic Performance\nLimited\") in 2004 recognised it as the most-played record by British\nbroadcasting of the past 70 years.[8] Also in 2004, _[Rolling\nStone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ placed \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\"\n57th on its list of the [500 Greatest Songs of All\nTime](/wiki/List_of_Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time \"List of\nRolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\").\n\nIn 1977, the song was named joint winner (along with\n[Queen](/wiki/Queen_\\(band\\) \"Queen \\(band\\)\")'s \"[Bohemian\nRhapsody](/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody \"Bohemian Rhapsody\")\") of \"The Best British\nPop Single 1952–1977\" at the [Brit Awards](/wiki/Brit_Awards \"Brit\nAwards\").[9] In 1998 the song was inducted into the [Grammy Hall of\nFame](/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame \"Grammy Hall of Fame\").[10] More than 1000\nrecorded cover versions by other artists are known.[11] The song has been\nincluded in many music compilations over the decades and has also been used in\nthe soundtracks of numerous films, including _[The Big\nChill](/wiki/The_Big_Chill_\\(film\\) \"The Big Chill \\(film\\)\")_ , _[Purple\nHaze](/wiki/Purple_Haze_\\(film\\) \"Purple Haze \\(film\\)\")_ , _[Breaking the\nWaves](/wiki/Breaking_the_Waves \"Breaking the Waves\")_ , _[The Boat That\nRocked](/wiki/The_Boat_That_Rocked \"The Boat That Rocked\")_ , [Martin\nScorsese](/wiki/Martin_Scorsese \"Martin Scorsese\")'s segment of _[New York\nStories](/wiki/New_York_Stories \"New York Stories\")_ ,\n_[Stonewall](/wiki/Stonewall \"Stonewall\")_ , and [Ken Burns](/wiki/Ken_Burns\n\"Ken Burns\") and [Lynn Novick](/wiki/Lynn_Novick \"Lynn Novick\")'s documentary\nseries _[The Vietnam War](/wiki/The_Vietnam_War_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Vietnam War\n\\(TV series\\)\")_. Cover versions of the song have also been featured in many\nfilms, for example, by [King Curtis](/wiki/King_Curtis \"King Curtis\") in\n_[Withnail and I](/wiki/Withnail_and_I \"Withnail and I\")_ and by [Annie\nLennox](/wiki/Annie_Lennox \"Annie Lennox\") in _[The\nNet](/wiki/The_Net_\\(1995_film\\) \"The Net \\(1995 film\\)\")_.\n\nThe original writing credits were for Brooker and Reid only.

Drums were by session drummer\n[Bill Eyden](/wiki/Bill_Eyden \"Bill Eyden\"). A few days later, the song was\nre-recorded with the band's then newly recruited drummer [Bobby\nHarrison](/wiki/Bobby_Harrison \"Bobby Harrison\"), but that version was\ndiscarded, and one of the original mono recordings was chosen for release.\n\nProducer for the record was [Denny Cordell](/wiki/Denny_Cordell \"Denny\nCordell\"), and Keith Grant was the sound engineer.[12] The song was included\non the US release of the _[Procol Harum](/wiki/Procol_Harum_\\(album\\) \"Procol\nHarum \\(album\\)\")_ album, in September 1967, but not on the later UK\nversion.[13]\n\n##\nLyrics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Whiter_Shade_of_Pale&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Lyrics\")]\n\nReid got the title and starting point for the song at a party. He overheard\nsomeone at the party saying to a woman, \"You've turned a whiter shade of\npale\", and the phrase stuck in his mind.[14][15] The original lyrics had four\nverses, of which only two are heard on the original recording. The third verse\nhas been heard in live performances by Procol Harum, and more seldom also the\nfourth.[16] The author of _Procol Harum: Beyond the Pale_ , Claes Johansen,\nsuggests that the song \"deals in metaphorical form with a male/female\nrelationship which after some negotiation ends in a sexual act\".[15] This is\nsupported by [Tim de Lisle](/wiki/Tim_de_Lisle \"Tim de Lisle\") in _Lives of\nthe Great Songs_ , who remarks that the lyrics concern a drunken seduction,\nwhich is described through references to sex as a form of travel, usually\nnautical, using mythical and literary journeys.[17] Other observers have also\ncommented that the lyrics concern a sexual relationship.[14]\n\nContrary to the above interpretations, Reid was quoted in the February 2008\nissue of _[Uncut](/wiki/Uncut_\\(magazine\\) \"Uncut \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine as\nsaying:\n\n> I was trying to conjure a mood as much as tell a straightforward, girl-\n> leaves-boy story. With the ceiling flying away and room humming harder, I\n> wanted to paint an image of a scene. I wasn’t trying to be mysterious with\n> those images, I was trying to be evocative. I suppose it seems like a\n> decadent scene I’m describing. But I was too young to have experienced any\n> decadence, then. I might have been smoking when I conceived it, but not when\n> I wrote. It was influenced by books, not drugs.\n\nStructurally and thematically, the song is unusual in many respects. While the\nrecorded version is 4:03 long, it is composed of only two verses, each with\nchorus. The piece is also more instrument-driven than most songs of the\nperiod, and with a much looser [rhyme scheme](/wiki/Rhyme_scheme \"Rhyme\nscheme\"). Its unusually allusive and referential lyrics are much more complex\nthan most lyrics of the time (for example, the chorus focuses on\n[Chaucer](/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer \"Geoffrey Chaucer\")'s \"[The Miller's\nTale](/wiki/The_Miller%27s_Tale \"The Miller's Tale\")\"). Thus, this piece can\nbe considered an early example of [progressive rock](/wiki/Progressive_rock\n\"Progressive rock\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe phrase _a whiter shade of pale_ has since gained widespread use in the\nEnglish language, noticed by several dictionaries.[18][19][20] As such, the\nphrase is today often used in contexts independent of any consideration of the\nsong.[21] It has also been heavily paraphrased, in forms like \"an Xer shade of\nY\", to the extent that it has been recognised as a [snowclone](/wiki/Snowclone\n\"Snowclone\")[22][23] – a type of [cliché](/wiki/Clich%C3%A9 \"Cliché\") and\n[phrasal template](/wiki/Phrasal_template \"Phrasal template\").\n\n##\nComposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Whiter_Shade_of_Pale&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Expo_Pink_Floyd_-\n_Organ.jpg/220px-Expo_Pink_Floyd_-_Organ.jpg)](/wiki/File:Expo_Pink_Floyd_-\n_Organ.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Expo_Pink_Floyd_-_Organ.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe song's distinctive, Bach-inspired organ part was played on a [Hammond\nM102](/wiki/Hammond_organ \"Hammond organ\").\n\nThe song is in moderate time in [C major](/wiki/C_major \"C major\") and is\ncharacterised by the [bassline](/wiki/Bassline \"Bassline\") moving stepwise\ndownwards in a repeated pattern throughout. In classical music this is known\nas a [ground bass](/wiki/Ground_bass \"Ground bass\"). The harmonic structure is\nidentical for the organ melody, the verse and the chorus, except that the\nchorus finishes with a [cadence](/wiki/Cadence_\\(music\\) \"Cadence \\(music\\)\").\nThe main organ melody appears at the beginning and after each verse/chorus.\nBut it is also heard throughout, playing variations of its theme and\n[counterpointing](/wiki/Counterpoint \"Counterpoint\") the vocal line. As the\nchorus commences \"And so it was, and later ...\", the vocal and organ\naccompaniment begin a short [crescendo](/wiki/Crescendo \"Crescendo\"), with the\norganist running his finger rapidly down and up the entire keyboard. The final\ninstrumental fades out to silence – a common device in pop music of the time.\n\nDutch author, and Bach aficionado, [Maarten 't Hart](/wiki/Maarten_%27t_Hart\n\"Maarten 't Hart\") calls \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" an \"original adaptation\" of\n[Johann Sebastian Bach](/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach \"Johann Sebastian Bach\")'s\n[Ich steh mit einem Fuß im Grabe, BWV\n156](/wiki/Ich_steh_mit_einem_Fu%C3%9F_im_Grabe,_BWV_156 \"Ich steh mit einem\nFuß im Grabe, BWV 156\"). Besides, the [Hammond organ](/wiki/Hammond_organ\n\"Hammond organ\") line of the song came from Bach's \"[Sleepers,\nWake!](/wiki/Wachet_auf,_ruft_uns_die_Stimme,_BWV_140 \"Wachet auf, ruft uns\ndie Stimme, BWV 140\")\" and \"[Air on the G String](/wiki/Air_on_the_G_String\n\"Air on the G String\")\", both of which use a similar stepwise bass motion. The\nsimilarity is referred to in the 1982 play [_The Real\nThing_](/wiki/The_Real_Thing_\\(play\\) \"The Real Thing \\(play\\)\") by [Tom\nStoppard](/wiki/Tom_Stoppard \"Tom Stoppard\") and 1991 film [_The\nCommitments_](/wiki/The_Commitments_\\(film\\) \"The Commitments \\(film\\)\"). A\nyet closer melodic influence that is seldom cited can arguably[_[weasel\nwords](/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words \"Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words\")_] be\nfound in the organ choral prelude \"O Mensch bewein dein' Sünde groß\" (O Man,\nLament Your Sin So Great), [BWV](/wiki/BWV \"BWV\") 622, from Bach's\n_[Orgelbüchlein](/wiki/Orgelb%C3%BCchlein \"Orgelbüchlein\")_ (Little Organ\nBook). The music also borrows ideas from \"[When a Man Loves a\nWoman](/wiki/When_a_Man_Loves_a_Woman_\\(song\\) \"When a Man Loves a Woman\n\\(song\\)\")\" by [Percy Sledge](/wiki/Percy_Sledge \"Percy Sledge\").[24]\n\n## Release and\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Whiter_Shade_of_Pale&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Release and reception\")]\n\nThe single was released on 12 May 1967 in the United Kingdom by [Deram\nRecords](/wiki/Deram_Records \"Deram Records\") and entered _[Record\nRetailer](/wiki/Record_Retailer \"Record Retailer\")_ 's chart (later the [UK\nSingles Chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\")) on 25 May. In two\nweeks it reached number 1, where it stayed for six weeks. Writing in 2005, Jim\nIrvin of _[Mojo](/wiki/Mojo_\\(magazine\\) \"Mojo \\(magazine\\)\")_ said that its\narrival at number 1 on 8 June 1967, on the same day that [the\nBeatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\")' _[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club\nBand](/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely\nHearts Club Band\")_ topped the national albums chart, marked the start of the\n[Summer of Love](/wiki/Summer_of_Love \"Summer of Love\") in Britain.[25]\n\nAccording to music journalist and author Harvey Kubernik, in the context of\nthe Summer of Love, \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" was the \"one song [that] stood\nabove all others, its Everest-like status conferred by no less than [John\nLennon](/wiki/John_Lennon \"John Lennon\") and [Paul\nMcCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\"), who were enthralled by the\nChaucerian wordplay and heavenly Baroque accompaniment\".[13] Kubernik also\nwrites that, amid the search for higher consciousness during the [flower\npower](/wiki/Flower_power \"Flower power\") era, the song \"galvanised a\ncongregation of disaffected youth dismissive of traditional religion but\nanxious to achieve spiritual salvation\".[26]\n\nIn the United States, the single reached number 5 on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") and sold over 1 million\ncopies. It also peaked at number 22 on the soul charts there.[27] In the\nNetherlands, the song entered the chart at number 1 in June 1967 and again\nreached number 1 in July 1972. A May 1972 re-release on [Fly\nRecords](/wiki/Fly_Records \"Fly Records\") stayed in the UK charts for a total\nof 12 weeks and peaked at number 13.\n\n\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" has continued to receive critical acclaim. Along with\n[Queen](/wiki/Queen_\\(band\\) \"Queen \\(band\\)\")'s \"[Bohemian\nRhapsody](/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody \"Bohemian Rhapsody\")\", \"A Whiter Shade of\nPale\" was jointly recognised as \"The Best British Pop Single 1952–1977\" at the\n[BRIT Awards](/wiki/BRIT_Awards \"BRIT Awards\"), part of [Elizabeth\nII](/wiki/Elizabeth_II \"Elizabeth II\")'s [Silver Jubilee](/wiki/Silver_Jubilee\n\"Silver Jubilee\"). In 1998 the song was inducted into the [Grammy Hall of\nFame](/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame \"Grammy Hall of Fame\"). In 2004, it appeared\nat number 57 on _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_\nmagazine's list of the \"[500 Greatest Songs of All\nTime](/wiki/List_of_Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time \"List of\nRolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\")\". British TV station [Channel\n4](/wiki/Channel_4 \"Channel 4\") placed the song at number 19 in its chart of\n\"The 100 Greatest No. 1 Singles\".[28]\n\n## Promotional\nfilms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Whiter_Shade_of_Pale&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Promotional films\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/The_conservatory%2C_Witley_Court.jpg/190px-\nThe_conservatory%2C_Witley_Court.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_conservatory,_Witley_Court.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_conservatory,_Witley_Court.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOne of the clips for the song was filmed at [Witley Court](/wiki/Witley_Court\n\"Witley Court\"), part of which was gutted by fire in 1937.\n\nThe first promotional clip for \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" was shot in the ruins\nof [Witley Court](/wiki/Witley_Court \"Witley Court\") in Worcestershire,\nEngland.[29] It features four of the five musicians who played on the hit\nsingle: Gary Brooker, Matthew Fisher, David Knights and Ray Royer, in\nperformance and walking through the ruins. Only the drummer in the video isn't\non the record: early band member Bobby Harrison is seen miming to session man\nBill Eyden's drumming. The film was directed by [Peter\nClifton](/wiki/Peter_Clifton \"Peter Clifton\"), whose insertion of [Vietnam\nWar](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\") newsreel footage caused it to be banned\nfrom airplay on the [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\")'s _[Top of the\nPops](/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops \"Top of the Pops\")_ TV show.[30]\n\nProcol Harum subsequently made a second promotional clip, using\n\"[Scopitone](/wiki/Scopitone \"Scopitone\")\" technology. By this time, [Robin\nTrower](/wiki/Robin_Trower \"Robin Trower\") and [B.J. Wilson](/wiki/B.J._Wilson\n\"B.J. Wilson\") had replaced Royer and Harrison in the band, so only three of\nthe five musicians on the recording are represented. No performance footage\nappears in this film – only scenes of the five musicians cavorting around\nLondon and running across fields. The same lineup, with Fisher wearing a\nmonk's [cowl](/wiki/Cowl \"Cowl\"), mimed to the song on _Top of the Pops_ ,\nalthough Brooker sang live. Black-and-white footage of the performance has\nbeen shown online. The song represents 1967 in the 2004 release _[Top of the\nPops 40th Anniversary 1964–2004\nDVD](/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops_40th_Anniversary_1964%E2%80%932004_DVD \"Top of the\nPops 40th Anniversary 1964–2004 DVD\")_.\n\nThere was also a film shot as part of [Joel Gallen](/wiki/Joel_Gallen \"Joel\nGallen\")'s Deja-View music video series.[31] Originally airing on various\nnetworks in late 1985 through 1986, this video starred [Harry Dean\nStanton](/wiki/Harry_Dean_Stanton \"Harry Dean Stanton\") and [Bernie\nTaupin](/wiki/Bernie_Taupin \"Bernie Taupin\"), but featured no member of the\nband. It has also aired on [VH1 Classic](/wiki/VH1_Classic \"VH1 Classic\"), and\nhas recently surfaced online.[32][33]\n\n## Authorship\nlawsuit[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Whiter_Shade_of_Pale&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Authorship lawsuit\")]\n\nIn 2005, former Procol Harum organist [Matthew Fisher](/wiki/Matthew_Fisher\n\"Matthew Fisher\") filed suit in the [High Court](/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice\n\"High Court of Justice\") against Gary Brooker and his publisher, claiming that\nhe co-wrote the music for the song.[34] Fisher won the case on 20 December\n2006 but was awarded 40% of the composers' share of the music copyright,\nrather than the 50% he was seeking and was not granted royalties for the\nperiod before 2005.[35]\n\nBrooker and publisher Onward Music were granted leave to appeal, and a hearing\non the matter was held before a panel of three judges during the week of 1\nOctober 2007. The decision, on 4 April 2008, by [Lord Justice\nMummery](/wiki/Lord_Justice_Mummery \"Lord Justice Mummery\"), in the [Court of\nAppeal](/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales \"Court of Appeal of England\nand Wales\") upheld Fisher's co-authorship[36] but ruled that he should receive\nno royalties as he had taken too long (38 years) to bring his claim to\nlitigation. Full royalty rights were returned to Brooker.[37]\n\nOn 5 November 2008, Fisher was granted permission to appeal this decision to\nthe [House of Lords](/wiki/Judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords \"Judicial\nfunctions of the House of Lords\").[38] Lawyers say it is the first time the\nLaw Lords have been asked to rule on a copyright dispute involving a song.[39]\nThe appeal was heard in the House of Lords on 22–23 April 2009.[40]\n\nOn 30 July 2009 the Law Lords unanimously ruled in Fisher's favour. They noted\nthat the delay in bringing the case had not caused any harm to the other\nparty; on the contrary he had benefited financially from it.
