        "# Rest (physics)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png) | This article's **tone or style may not reflect the[encyclopedic tone](/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Tone \"Wikipedia:Writing better articles\") used on Wikipedia**. See Wikipedia's [guide to writing better articles](/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Tone \"Wikipedia:Writing better articles\") for suggestions. _(January 2013)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this template message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal \"Help:Maintenance template removal\"))_  \n---|---  \n  \n**Rest** , in [physics](/wiki/Physics \"Physics\"), refers to an object being\n[stationary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Stationary \"wikt:Stationary\")\nrelative to a particular [frame of reference](/wiki/Frame_of_reference \"Frame\nof reference\") or another object. When the position of a body with respect to\nits surroundings does not change with [time](/wiki/Time \"Time\") it is said to\nbe \"at rest\". According to the [theory of\nrelativity](/wiki/Theory_of_relativity \"Theory of relativity\"), it is said\nthat an object is \"at rest relative to\" another. For example, a train\n[decelerates](/wiki/Acceleration \"Acceleration\") approaching a station and\neventually comes to rest alongside the platform. The train can be said to be\n\"at rest with respect to the station\", or, as the correct frame of reference\nis usually implicit and/or provided by context, simply \"at rest\".\n\nGiven an [inertial frame of reference](/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference\n\"Inertial frame of reference\"), [Newton's first law of\nmotion](/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion \"Newton's laws of motion\") states that\nan object at rest will remain at rest, while the\n[motion](/wiki/Motion_\\(physics\\) \"Motion \\(physics\\)\") of a moving object\nwill remain unchanged until acted upon by an [external\nforce](/w/index.php?title=External_force&action=edit&redlink=1 \"External force\n\\(page does not exist\\)\").[1][2] An object at rest, therefore, can be\ndescribed as without [velocity](/wiki/Velocity \"Velocity\") and\n[acceleration](/wiki/Acceleration \"Acceleration\") – although, according to\nrelativity, an object is either at rest or in motion relative to other moving\nobjects. The concept of \"relative rest\" is closely linked to that of [inertial\nobservers](/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference \"Inertial frame of reference\")\nand the statement that nothing is at absolute rest is loosely equivalent to\nstating that there are no frames of reference which are truly inertial. So-\ncalled non-inertial observers are addressed by the theory of [general\nrelativity](/wiki/General_relativity \"General relativity\").\n\nIn reality, there is nothing at [absolute](/wiki/Absolute_time_and_space\n\"Absolute time and space\") rest. For example, [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\")'s\n[gravitation](/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth \"Gravity of Earth\") constantly pulls\nobjects toward its surface, while Earth is one of the objects the\n[Sun](/wiki/Sun \"Sun\") constantly pulls towards itself, causing it to orbit\nthe Sun; the Sun, in turn, orbits the center of the [Milky\nWay](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\"); and so on.Two or more than two objects are\nsaid to be at rest,if its position with respect to each other is not changing\nor moving with uniform velocity with respect to each other.Rest and motion are\nrelative term.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rest_\\(physics\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Newton's first law\"](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-1/Newton-s-First-Law).

                "Explanation": "The document provides a contextual understanding of 'rest' and its relativity, but does not directly address the specific conditions one is looking for in the query, i.e., an object is at rest when its position does not change over time relative to its surroundings."
