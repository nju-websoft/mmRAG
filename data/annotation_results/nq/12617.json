The lyrics come from **Defence of Fort M 'Henry**,[2] a\n[poem](/wiki/Poem \"Poem\") written on September 14, 1814, by the then 35-year-\nold lawyer and amateur poet [Francis Scott Key](/wiki/Francis_Scott_Key\n\"Francis Scott Key\") after witnessing the bombardment of [Fort\nMcHenry](/wiki/Fort_McHenry \"Fort McHenry\") by British ships of the [Royal\nNavy](/wiki/Royal_Navy \"Royal Navy\") in Baltimore Harbor during the [Battle of\nBaltimore](/wiki/Battle_of_Baltimore \"Battle of Baltimore\") in the [War of\n1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\"). Key was inspired by the large [U.S.\nflag](/wiki/U.S._flag \"U.S. flag\"), with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the\n[Star-Spangled Banner](/wiki/Star-Spangled_Banner_\\(flag\\) \"Star-Spangled\nBanner \\(flag\\)\"), flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.\n\nThe poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by [John\nStafford Smith](/wiki/John_Stafford_Smith \"John Stafford Smith\") for the\n[Anacreontic Society](/wiki/Anacreontic_Society \"Anacreontic Society\"), a\nmen's social club in London. \"[To Anacreon in\nHeaven](/wiki/To_Anacreon_in_Heaven \"To Anacreon in Heaven\")\" (or \"The\nAnacreontic Song\"), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United\nStates. Set to Key's poem and renamed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", it soon\nbecame a well-known U.S. patriotic song. With a [range](/wiki/Range_\\(music\\)\n\"Range \\(music\\)\") of 19 semitones, it is known for being very difficult to\nsing. Although the poem has four [stanzas](/wiki/Stanza \"Stanza\"), only the\nfirst is commonly sung today.\n\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was recognized for official use by the [United\nStates Navy](/wiki/United_States_Navy \"United States Navy\") in 1889, and by\nU.S. President [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson \"Woodrow Wilson\") in\n1916, and was made the national anthem by a\n[congressional](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\")\n[resolution](/wiki/Resolution_\\(law\\) \"Resolution \\(law\\)\") on March 3, 1931\n(46 Stat. 1508, codified at [36\nU.S.C.](/wiki/Title_36_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 36 of the United\nStates Code\") [§ 301](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/301)), which\nwas signed by President [Herbert Hoover](/wiki/Herbert_Hoover \"Herbert\nHoover\").\n\nBefore 1931, other songs served as the hymns of U.S. officialdom. \"[Hail,\nColumbia](/wiki/Hail,_Columbia \"Hail, Columbia\")\" served this purpose at\nofficial functions for most of the 19th century. \"[My Country, 'Tis of\nThee](/wiki/My_Country,_%27Tis_of_Thee \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\")\", whose\nmelody is identical to \"[God Save the Queen](/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen \"God\nSave the Queen\")\", the United Kingdom's national anthem,[3] also served as a\n_de facto_ national anthem.[4] Following the War of 1812 and subsequent U.S.\nwars, other songs emerged to compete for popularity at public events, among\nthem \"[America the Beautiful](/wiki/America_the_Beautiful \"America the\nBeautiful\")\".\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Early history\n    * 1.1 Francis Scott Key's lyrics\n    * 1.2 John Stafford Smith's music\n    * 1.3 National anthem\n  * 2 Modern history\n    * 2.1 Performances\n    * 2.2 200th anniversary celebrations\n    * 2.3 Adaptations\n  * 3 Lyrics\n    * 3.1 Additional Civil War period lyrics\n      * 3.1.1 Alternative lyrics\n  * 4 References in film, television, literature\n  * 5 Customs and federal law\n  * 6 Protests\n    * 6.1 1968 Olympics Black Power salute\n    * 6.2 2016 protests\n    * 6.3 NAACP call to remove the national anthem\n  * 7 Translations\n  * 8 Media\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 Further reading\n  * 12 External links\n    * 12.1 Historical audio\n\n## Early history\n\n### Francis Scott Key's lyrics\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/KeysSSB.jpg/170px-\nKeysSSB.jpg)](/wiki/File:KeysSSB.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:KeysSSB.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Francis Scott Key](/wiki/Francis_Scott_Key \"Francis Scott Key\")'s original\nmanuscript copy of his \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\" poem.

Their objective was to\nsecure an exchange of prisoners, one of whom was [Dr. William\nBeanes](/wiki/William_Beanes \"William Beanes\"), the elderly and popular town\nphysician of [Upper Marlboro](/wiki/Upper_Marlboro,_Maryland \"Upper Marlboro,\nMaryland\") and a friend of Key's who had been captured in his home. Beanes was\naccused of aiding the arrest of British soldiers. Key and Skinner boarded the\nBritish [flagship](/wiki/Flagship \"Flagship\") [HMS\n_Tonnant_](/wiki/HMS_Tonnant \"HMS Tonnant\") on September 7 and spoke with\nMajor General [Robert Ross](/wiki/Robert_Ross_\\(general\\) \"Robert Ross\n\\(general\\)\") and Vice Admiral [Alexander Cochrane](/wiki/Alexander_Cochrane\n\"Alexander Cochrane\") over dinner while the two officers discussed war plans.\nAt first, Ross and Cochrane refused to release Beanes but relented after Key\nand Skinner showed them letters written by wounded British prisoners praising\nBeanes and other Americans for their kind treatment.\n\nBecause Key and Skinner had heard details of the plans for [the attack on\nBaltimore](/wiki/Battle_of_Baltimore \"Battle of Baltimore\"), they were held\ncaptive until after the battle, first aboard [HMS\n_Surprise_](/wiki/HMS_Surprise_\\(1812\\) \"HMS Surprise \\(1812\\)\") and later\nback on HMS _Minden_. After the bombardment, certain British gunboats\nattempted to slip past the fort and effect a landing in a cove to the west of\nit, but they were turned away by fire from nearby Fort Covington, the city's\nlast line of defense.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Ft._Henry_bombardement_1814.jpg/220px-\nFt._Henry_bombardement_1814.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ft._Henry_bombardement_1814.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ft._Henry_bombardement_1814.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn artist's rendering of the battle at [Fort McHenry](/wiki/Fort_McHenry \"Fort\nMcHenry\")\n\nDuring the rainy night, Key had witnessed the bombardment and observed that\nthe [fort](/wiki/Fortress \"Fortress\")'s smaller \"storm flag\" continued to fly,\nbut once the shell and [Congreve rocket](/wiki/Congreve_rocket \"Congreve\nrocket\")[5] barrage had stopped, he would not know how the battle had turned\nout until dawn.

This flag, with fifteen stars and fifteen\nstripes, had been made by [Mary Young Pickersgill](/wiki/Mary_Pickersgill\n\"Mary Pickersgill\") together with other workers in her home on Baltimore's\nPratt Street. The flag later came to be known as the [Star-Spangled\nBanner](/wiki/Star-Spangled_Banner_\\(flag\\) \"Star-Spangled Banner \\(flag\\)\")\nand is today on display in the [National Museum of American\nHistory](/wiki/National_Museum_of_American_History \"National Museum of\nAmerican History\"), a treasure of the [Smithsonian\nInstitution](/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution \"Smithsonian Institution\"). It was\nrestored in 1914 by [Amelia Fowler](/wiki/Amelia_Fowler \"Amelia Fowler\"), and\nagain in 1998 as part of an ongoing conservation program.\n\nAboard the ship the next day, Key wrote a poem on the back of a letter he had\nkept in his pocket. At twilight on September 16, he and Skinner were released\nin Baltimore. He completed the poem at the Indian Queen Hotel, where he was\nstaying, and titled it \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\". It was first published\nnationally in _[The Analectic Magazine](/wiki/Analectic_Magazine \"Analectic\nMagazine\")_.[6][7]\n\nMuch of the idea of the poem, including the flag imagery and some of the\nwording, is derived from an earlier song by Key, also set to the tune of \"[The\nAnacreontic Song](/wiki/The_Anacreontic_Song \"The Anacreontic Song\")\". The\nsong, known as \"When the Warrior Returns\",[8] was written in honor of [Stephen\nDecatur](/wiki/Stephen_Decatur \"Stephen Decatur\") and [Charles\nStewart](/wiki/Charles_Stewart_\\(1778%E2%80%931869\\) \"Charles Stewart\n\\(1778–1869\\)\") on their return from the [First Barbary\nWar](/wiki/First_Barbary_War \"First Barbary War\").  Absent elaboration by\nFrancis Scott Key prior to his death in 1843, some have speculated in modern\ntimes about the meaning of phrases or verses. According to British historian\n[Robin Blackburn](/wiki/Robin_Blackburn \"Robin Blackburn\"), the words \"the\nhireling and slave\" allude to the thousands of ex-slaves in the British ranks\norganised as the Corps of Colonial Marines, who had been liberated by the\nBritish and demanded to be placed in the battle line \"where they might expect\nto meet their former masters.\"[9] Nevertheless, Professor Mark Clague, a\nprofessor of [musicology](/wiki/Musicology \"Musicology\") at the [University of\nMichigan](/wiki/University_of_Michigan \"University of Michigan\"), argues that\nthe \"middle two verses of Key's lyric vilify the British enemy in the War of\n1812\" and \"in no way glorifies or celebrates slavery.\"[10] Clague writes that\n\"For Key ... the British mercenaries were scoundrels and the Colonial Marines\nwere traitors who threatened to spark a national insurrection.\"[10] This\nharshly anti-British nature of Verse 3 led to its omission in [sheet\nmusic](/wiki/Sheet_music \"Sheet music\") in World War I, when the British and\nthe U.S. were allies.[10] Responding to the assertion of writer Jon Schwarz of\n_[The Intercept](/wiki/The_Intercept \"The Intercept\")_ that the song is a\n\"celebration of slavery,\"[11] Clague said that: \"The reference to slaves is\nabout the use and in some sense the manipulation, of black Americans to fight\nfor the British, with the promise of freedom. The American forces included\nAfrican-Americans as well as whites. The term 'freemen,' whose heroism is\ncelebrated in the fourth stanza, would have encompassed both.\"[12]\n\nOthers suggest that \"Key may have intended the phrase as a reference to the\nBritish Navy's practice of [impressment](/wiki/Impressment \"Impressment\")\n(kidnapping sailors and forcing them to fight in defense of the crown), or as\na semi-metaphorical slap at the British invading force as a whole (which\nincluded a large number of mercenaries).\"[13]\n\n### John Stafford Smith's music\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/2_Star_Spangled_Banner.png/170px-2_Star_Spangled_Banner.png)](/wiki/File:2_Star_Spangled_Banner.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2_Star_Spangled_Banner.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSheet music version [![About this\nsound](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-\nLoudspeaker.svg.png)](/wiki/File:2_Star_Spangled_Banner.mid \"About this\nsound\")\n[Play](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/2_Star_Spangled_Banner.mid\n\"2 Star Spangled Banner.mid\") ([help](/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_help\n\"Wikipedia:Media help\")·[info](/wiki/File:2_Star_Spangled_Banner.mid \"File:2\nStar Spangled Banner.mid\"))\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/JohnStaffordSmith01.jpg/220px-\nJohnStaffordSmith01.jpg)](/wiki/File:JohnStaffordSmith01.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:JohnStaffordSmith01.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe memorial to [John Stafford Smith](/wiki/John_Stafford_Smith \"John Stafford\nSmith\") in [Gloucester Cathedral](/wiki/Gloucester_Cathedral \"Gloucester\nCathedral\"), [Gloucester](/wiki/Gloucester \"Gloucester\"), England\n\nKey gave the poem to his brother-in-law Judge Joseph H. Nicholson who saw that\nthe words fit the popular melody \"[The Anacreontic\nSong](/wiki/The_Anacreontic_Song \"The Anacreontic Song\")\", by English composer\n[John Stafford Smith](/wiki/John_Stafford_Smith \"John Stafford Smith\"). This\nwas the official song of the [Anacreontic Society](/wiki/Anacreontic_Society\n\"Anacreontic Society\"), an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians\nin London. Nicholson took the poem to a printer in Baltimore, who anonymously\nmade the first known [broadside](/wiki/Broadside_\\(music\\) \"Broadside\n\\(music\\)\") printing on September 17; of these, two known copies survive.\n\nOn September 20, both the _Baltimore Patriot_ and _The American_ printed the\nsong, with the note \"Tune: Anacreon in Heaven\". The song quickly became\npopular, with seventeen newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire printing it.\nSoon after, Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the\nwords and music together under the title \"The Star Spangled Banner\", although\nit was originally called \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\". Thomas Carr's arrangement\nintroduced the raised fourth which became the standard deviation from \"The\nAnacreontic Song\".[14] The song's popularity increased and its first public\nperformance took place in October when Baltimore actor [Ferdinand\nDurang](/wiki/Ferdinand_Durang \"Ferdinand Durang\") sang it at Captain\nMcCauley's [tavern](/wiki/Tavern \"Tavern\"). [Washington\nIrving](/wiki/Washington_Irving \"Washington Irving\"), then editor of the\n_[Analectic Magazine](/wiki/Analectic_Magazine \"Analectic Magazine\")_ in\nPhiladelphia, reprinted the song in November 1814.\n\nBy the early 20th century, there were various versions of the song in popular\nuse. Seeking a singular, standard version, President Woodrow Wilson tasked the\nU.S. Bureau of Education with providing that official version. In response,\nthe Bureau enlisted the help of five musicians to agree upon an arrangement.\nThose musicians were [Walter Damrosch](/wiki/Walter_Damrosch \"Walter\nDamrosch\"), [Will Earhart](/wiki/Will_Earhart \"Will Earhart\"), Arnold J.\nGantvoort, [Oscar Sonneck](/wiki/Oscar_Sonneck \"Oscar Sonneck\") and [John\nPhilip Sousa](/wiki/John_Philip_Sousa \"John Philip Sousa\"). The standardized\nversion that was voted upon by these five musicians premiered at [Carnegie\nHall](/wiki/Carnegie_Hall \"Carnegie Hall\") on December 5, 1917, in a program\nthat included [Edward Elgar](/wiki/Edward_Elgar \"Edward Elgar\")'s _Carillon_\nand [Gabriel Pierné](/wiki/Gabriel_Piern%C3%A9 \"Gabriel Pierné\")'s _The\nChildren 's Crusade_.

Colonel Caleb Carlton, Post Commander, established the tradition that\nthe song be played \"at retreat and at the close of parades and concerts.\"\nCarlton explained the custom to Governor Sheldon of South Dakota who \"promised\nme that he would try to have the custom established among the state militia.\"\nCarlton wrote that after a similar discussion, Secretary of War, Daniel E.\nLamont issued an order that it \"be played at every Army post every evening at\nretreat.\"[17]\n\nIn 1899, the U.S. Navy officially adopted \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".[18] In\n1916, President [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson \"Woodrow Wilson\")\nordered that \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" be played at military[18] and other\nappropriate occasions. The playing of the song two years later during the\n[seventh-inning stretch](/wiki/Seventh-inning_stretch \"Seventh-inning\nstretch\") of Game One of the [1918 World Series](/wiki/1918_World_Series \"1918\nWorld Series\"), and thereafter during each game of the series is often cited\nas the first instance that the anthem was played at a baseball game,[19]\nthough evidence shows that the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" was performed as early\nas 1897 at opening day ceremonies in [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia\n\"Philadelphia\") and then more regularly at the [Polo\nGrounds](/wiki/Polo_Grounds \"Polo Grounds\") in New York City beginning in\n1898. In any case, the tradition of performing the national anthem before\n_every_ baseball game began in [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War\nII\").[20]\n\nOn April 10, 1918, [John Charles Linthicum](/wiki/John_Charles_Linthicum \"John\nCharles Linthicum\"), U.S. Congressman from Maryland, introduced a bill to\nofficially recognize \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem.[21]\nThe bill did not pass.[21] On April 15, 1929, Linthicum introduced the bill\nagain, his sixth time doing so.[21] On November 3, 1929, [Robert\nRipley](/wiki/Robert_Ripley \"Robert Ripley\") drew a panel in his syndicated\ncartoon, _[Ripley's Believe it or Not!](/wiki/Ripley%27s_Believe_it_or_Not!\n\"Ripley's Believe it or Not!\")_, saying \"Believe It or Not, America has no\nnational anthem\".[22]\n\nIn 1930, [Veterans of Foreign Wars](/wiki/Veterans_of_Foreign_Wars \"Veterans\nof Foreign Wars\") started a petition for the United States to officially\nrecognize \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem.[23] Five million\npeople signed the petition.[23] The petition was presented to the [United\nStates House Committee on the\nJudiciary](/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary \"United States\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary\") on January 31, 1930.[24] On the same day,\nElsie Jorss-Reilley and Grace Evelyn Boudlin sang the song to the Committee to\nrefute the perception that it was too high pitched for a typical person to\nsing.[25] The Committee voted in favor of sending the bill to the House floor\nfor a vote.[26] The [House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") passed the bill later that year.[27] The\n[Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\") passed the bill on\nMarch 3, 1931.[27] [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States_of_America\n\"President of the United States of America\") [Herbert\nHoover](/wiki/Herbert_Hoover \"Herbert Hoover\") signed the bill on March 4,\n1931, officially adopting \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the national anthem of\nthe United States of America.[1] As currently codified, the [United States\nCode](/wiki/United_States_Code \"United States Code\") states that \"[t]he\ncomposition consisting of the words and music known as the Star-Spangled\nBanner is the national anthem.\"[28]\n\n## Modern history\n\nMain article: [Performances and adaptations of The Star-Spangled\nBanner](/wiki/Performances_and_adaptations_of_The_Star-Spangled_Banner\n\"Performances and adaptations of The Star-Spangled Banner\")\n\n### Performances\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-\nAmbox_important.svg.png)| This section **may\ncontain[indiscriminate](/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information\n\"Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not\"), [excessive](/wiki/Wikipedia:ListFormat\n\"Wikipedia:ListFormat\"), or [irrelevant](/wiki/Wikipedia:UNDUE\n\"Wikipedia:UNDUE\") examples**.

The pre-recording of the anthem has\nbecome standard practice at some ballparks, such as Boston's [Fenway\nPark](/wiki/Fenway_Park \"Fenway Park\"), according to the [SABR](/wiki/SABR\n\"SABR\") publication _The Fenway Project_.[29]\n\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" has been performed regularly at the beginning of\n[NFL](/wiki/NFL \"NFL\") games since the end of [WWII](/wiki/WWII \"WWII\") by\norder of NFL commissioner [Elmer Layden](/wiki/Elmer_Layden \"Elmer Layden\"),\naccording to History.com .[30] According to same article, the song has been\nintermittently performed at baseball games since after [WWI](/wiki/WWI \"WWI\")\nIt has also been popular as performed by orchestra or soloists at other public\ngatherings.

The response from\nmany in the [Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\")-era U.S. was\ngenerally negative. Despite the controversy, Feliciano's performance opened\nthe door for the countless interpretations of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" heard\nin the years since.[39] One week after Feliciano's performance, the anthem was\nin the news again when U.S. athletes [Tommie Smith](/wiki/Tommie_Smith \"Tommie\nSmith\") and [John Carlos](/wiki/John_Carlos \"John Carlos\") lifted\ncontroversial [raised fists at the 1968\nOlympics](/wiki/1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute \"1968 Olympics Black Power\nsalute\") while the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" played at a medal ceremony.\n\n[Marvin Gaye](/wiki/Marvin_Gaye \"Marvin Gaye\") gave a [soul](/wiki/Soul_music\n\"Soul music\")-influenced performance at the [1983 NBA All-Star\nGame](/wiki/1983_NBA_All-Star_Game \"1983 NBA All-Star Game\") and [Whitney\nHouston](/wiki/Whitney_Houston \"Whitney Houston\") gave a soulful rendition\nbefore [Super Bowl XXV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXV \"Super Bowl XXV\") in 1991, which\nwas released as a single that charted at number 20 in 1991 and number 6 in\n2001 (along with [José Feliciano](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Feliciano \"José Feliciano\"),\nthe only times the national anthem has been on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")).

On June 22, 1942, the law\nwas revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing,\nwhile others should simply stand at attention, men removing their hats. The\nsame code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts\nwhen the flag is displayed during the playing of the national anthem, but not\nif the flag was not present. On December 23, 1942, the law was again revised\ninstructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of\nthe music when it was played. That revision also directed men and women to\nplace their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed. Those in\nuniform were required to salute. On July 7, 1976, the law was simplified. Men\nand women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts, men\nremoving their hats, irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and\nthose in uniform saluting. On August 12, 1998, the law was rewritten keeping\nthe same instructions, but differentiating between \"those in uniform\" and\n\"members of the Armed Forces and veterans\" who were both instructed to salute\nduring the playing whether or not the flag was displayed. Because of the\nchanges in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the\nPledge of Allegiance versus the National Anthem, throughout most of the 20th\ncentury many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in\nfront of them during the playing of the Anthem, and when reciting the Pledge\nthey would hold their hand (or hat) over their heart. After 9/11, the custom\nof placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the national anthem\nbecame nearly universal.[63][64][65]\n\nSince 1998, federal law (viz., the United States Code [36\nU.S.C.](/wiki/Title_36_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 36 of the United\nStates Code\") [§ 301](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/301)) states\nthat during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed,\nall present including those in uniform should stand at attention; Non-military\nservice individuals should face the flag with the right hand over the heart;\nMembers of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present and not in uniform\nmay render the military salute; military service persons not in uniform should\nremove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the\nleft shoulder, the hand being over the heart; and Members of the Armed Forces\nand veterans who are in uniform should give the military salute at the first\nnote of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. The law\nfurther provides that when the flag is not displayed, all present should face\ntoward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were\ndisplayed. Military law requires all vehicles on the installation to stop when\nthe song is played and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face\nthe direction of the music and either salute, in uniform, or place the right\nhand over the heart, if out of uniform. The law was amended in 2008, and since\nallows military veterans to salute out of uniform, as well.[66][67]\n\nThe text of [36 U.S.C.](/wiki/Title_36_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 36 of\nthe United States Code\") [§\n301](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/301) is suggestive and not\nregulatory in nature. Failure to follow the suggestions is not a violation of\nthe law. This behavioral requirement for the national anthem is subject to the\nsame [First Amendment](/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"First Amendment to the United States Constitution\") controversies that\nsurround the [Pledge of\nAllegiance](/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance_\\(United_States\\) \"Pledge of Allegiance\n\\(United States\\)\").[68] For example, [Jehovah's\nWitnesses](/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses \"Jehovah's Witnesses\") do not sing the\nnational anthem, though they are taught that standing is an \"ethical decision\"\nthat individual believers must make based on their \"conscience.\"[69][70][71]\n\n## Protests\n\nMain article: [U.S. national anthem\nprotests](/wiki/U.S._national_anthem_protests \"U.S. national anthem protests\")\n\n### 1968 Olympics Black Power salute\n\nMain article: [1968 Olympics Black Power\nsalute](/wiki/1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute \"1968 Olympics Black Power\nsalute\")\n\nThe 1968 Olympics Black Power salute was a political demonstration conducted\nby [African-American](/wiki/African-American \"African-American\") athletes\n[Tommie Smith](/wiki/Tommie_Smith \"Tommie Smith\") and [John\nCarlos](/wiki/John_Carlos \"John Carlos\") during their medal ceremony at the\n[1968 Summer Olympics](/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics \"1968 Summer Olympics\") in\nthe [Olympic Stadium](/wiki/Estadio_Ol%C3%ADmpico_Universitario \"Estadio\nOlímpico Universitario\") in [Mexico City](/wiki/Mexico_City \"Mexico City\").\nAfter having won gold and bronze medals respectively in the\n[200-meter](/wiki/200_metres_at_the_Olympics \"200 metres at the Olympics\")\nrunning event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the\nAmerican national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Each athlete [raised a\nblack-gloved fist](/wiki/Raised_fist \"Raised fist\"), and kept them raised\nuntil the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian\nsilver medalist [Peter Norman](/wiki/Peter_Norman \"Peter Norman\") all wore\nhuman rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, _Silent Gesture_ ,\nSmith stated that the gesture was not a \"[Black Power](/wiki/Black_Power\n\"Black Power\")\" salute, but a \"human rights salute\".
