No known [Taíno texts](/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_language \"Taíno\nlanguage\") survive, hence, historical evidence for those names comes to us\nthrough three [historians](/wiki/Historian \"Historian\"): the Italian [Pietro\nMartyr d‘Anghiera](/wiki/Peter_Martyr_d%27Anghiera \"Peter Martyr d'Anghiera\"),\nand the Spaniards [Bartolomé de las Casas](/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas\n\"Bartolomé de las Casas\") and [Gonzalo Fernández de\nOviedo](/wiki/Gonzalo_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Oviedo_y_Vald%C3%A9s \"Gonzalo\nFernández de Oviedo y Valdés\"). Fernández de Oviedo and de las Casas both\nrecorded that the island was called _Haiti_ (\"Mountainous Land\") by the Taíno.\nD'Anghiera added another name, _Quizqueia_ (supposedly \"Mother of all Lands\"),\nbut later research shows that the word does not seem to derive from the\noriginal [Arawak](/wiki/Arawakan_languages \"Arawakan languages\") Taíno\nlanguage.[3] (_Quisqueya_ is today mostly used in the [Dominican\nRepublic](/wiki/Dominican_Republic \"Dominican Republic\").) Although the\nTaínos' use of _Haiti_ is verified, and the name was used by all three\nhistorians, evidence suggests that it probably was not the Taíno name of the\nwhole island, but only for a region (now known as _[Los\nHaitises](/wiki/Los_Haitises_National_Park \"Los Haitises National Park\")_) in\nthe northeastern section of the present-day Dominican Republic.\n\nWhen Columbus took possession of the island in 1492, he named it\n_Insula[Hispana](/wiki/Hispania \"Hispania\")_ in [Latin](/wiki/Latin\n\"Latin\")[7] and _La Isla Española_ in Spanish,[8] with both meaning \"the\nSpanish island\". De las Casas shortened the name to \"Española\", and when\nd‘Anghiera detailed his account of the island in [Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\"),\nhe rendered its name as _Hispaniola_.[8] In the oldest documented map of the\nisland, created by Andrés de Morales, Los Haitises is labeled _Montes de\nHaití_ (\"Haiti Mountains\"), and de las Casas apparently named the whole island\nHaiti on the basis of that particular region,[4] as d'Anghiera states that the\nname of one part was given to the whole island.[3]\n\nDue to Taíno, Spanish and French influences on the island, historically the\nwhole island was often referred to as _Haiti,_ _Hayti,_ _Santo Domingo,_ _St.\nDomingue,_ or _San Domingo._ The colonial terms _[Saint-Domingue](/wiki/Saint-\nDomingue \"Saint-Domingue\")_ and _[Santo\nDomingo](/wiki/Captaincy_General_of_Santo_Domingo \"Captaincy General of Santo\nDomingo\")_ are sometimes still applied to the whole island, though these names\nrefer, respectively, to the colonies that became Haiti and the Dominican\nRepublic.[9] Since Anghiera's literary work was translated into\n[English](/wiki/English_language \"English language\") and\n[French](/wiki/French_language \"French language\") soon after being written,\nthe name \"Hispaniola\" became the most frequently used term in English-speaking\ncountries for the island in scientific and cartographic works. In 1918, the\nUnited States occupation government, led by [Harry Shepard\nKnapp](/wiki/Harry_Shepard_Knapp \"Harry Shepard Knapp\"), obliged the use of\nthe name Hispaniola on the island, and recommended the use of that name to the\n[National Geographic Society](/wiki/National_Geographic_Society \"National\nGeographic Society\").[10]\n\nThe name _Haïti_ was adopted by Haitian revolutionary [Jean-Jacques\nDessalines](/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Dessalines \"Jean-Jacques Dessalines\") in 1804,\nas the official name of independent Saint-Domingue, as a tribute to the\nAmerindian predecessors. It was also adopted as the official name of\nindependent Santo Domingo, as the _[Republic of Spanish\nHaiti](/wiki/Republic_of_Spanish_Haiti \"Republic of Spanish Haiti\"),_ a state\nthat existed from November 1821 until its annexation by Haiti in February\n1822.[11][12]\n\n### Post-Columbian[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hispaniola&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Post-Columbian\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Columbus_landing_on_Hispaniola_adj.jpg/220px-\nColumbus_landing_on_Hispaniola_adj.jpg)](/wiki/File:Columbus_landing_on_Hispaniola_adj.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Columbus_landing_on_Hispaniola_adj.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nColumbus landing on Hispaniola\n\n[Christopher Columbus](/wiki/Christopher_Columbus \"Christopher Columbus\")\ninadvertently landed on the island during his first voyage across the Atlantic\nin 1492, where his flagship, the _[Santa Maria](/wiki/Santa_Maria_\\(ship\\)\n\"Santa Maria \\(ship\\)\")_ , sank after running aground on December 25. A\ncontingent of men were left at an outpost christened [La\nNavidad](/wiki/La_Navidad \"La Navidad\"), on the north coast of present-day\n[Haiti](/wiki/Haiti \"Haiti\"). On his return the following year,[13] following\nthe destruction of La Navidad by the local population, Columbus quickly\nestablished a second compound farther east in present-day [Dominican\nRepublic](/wiki/Dominican_Republic \"Dominican Republic\"), [La\nIsabela](/wiki/La_Isabela \"La Isabela\").\n\nThe island was inhabited by the [Taíno](/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_people \"Taíno\npeople\"), one of the indigenous [Arawak peoples](/wiki/Arawak_peoples \"Arawak\npeoples\"). The Taino were at first tolerant of Columbus and his crew, and\nhelped him to construct [La Navidad](/wiki/La_Navidad \"La Navidad\") on what is\nnow [Môle-Saint-Nicolas](/wiki/M%C3%B4le-Saint-Nicolas \"Môle-Saint-Nicolas\"),\nHaiti, in December 1492. European colonization of the island began in earnest\nthe following year, when 1,300 men arrived from [Spain](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\")\nunder the watch of [Bartolomeo Columbus](/wiki/Bartolomeo_Columbus \"Bartolomeo\nColumbus\"). In 1496 the town of _Nueva Isabela_ was founded. After being\ndestroyed by a [hurricane](/wiki/Hurricane \"Hurricane\"), it was rebuilt on the\nopposite side of the Ozama River and called [Santo\nDomingo](/wiki/Santo_Domingo \"Santo Domingo\"). It is the oldest permanent\nEuropean settlement in the Americas.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png/296px-\nCopia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png)](/wiki/File:Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Copia_de_Cacicazgos_de_la_Hispaniola.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Chiefdoms of Hispaniola](/wiki/Chiefdoms_of_Hispaniola \"Chiefdoms of\nHispaniola\")\n\nSeveral 16th century writers estimated the 1492 population of Hispaniola at\nover 1 million people.[14] Twentieth-century estimates of the figure range\nfrom 60,000 to 8,000,000, but center around the 500,000 to 1,000,000\nrange.[14] Harsh enslavement by Spanish colonists, redirection of food\nsupplies and labor towards the colonists, had a devastating impact on both\nmortality and fertility over the first quarter century.[15] Colonial\nadministrators and Dominican and Hyeronimite priests observed that the search\nfor gold and agrarian enslavement through the encomienda system were\ndepressing population.[15] Demographic data from two provinces in 1514 shows a\nlow birth rate consistent with a 3.5% annual population decline. Just 14,000\nTaínos survived in 1517.[16] In 1503 the colony began to import\n[African](/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Africa \"Ethnic groups of Africa\")\n[slaves](/wiki/Slaves \"Slaves\"), believing them more capable of performing\nphysical labor.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe first documented outbreak of smallpox, previously an Eastern hemisphere\ndisease, on Hispaniola occurred in December 1518 among enslaved African\nminers.[15][17] Some scholars speculate that European diseases arrived before\nthis date, but there is no compelling evidence for an outbreak.[15] The\nnatives had no immunity to European diseases, including\n[smallpox](/wiki/Smallpox \"Smallpox\").[18][19] By May 1519, as many as one-\nthird of the remaining Taínos had died.[17]\n\nChristopher Columbus brought sugar cane on his second voyage to the island.\nMolasses was the chief product. Diego Colon's plantation had 40 African slaves\nin 1522. By 1526, 19 mills were in operation from Azua to Santo\nDomingo.[20]:224\n\nIn 1574, a census taken of the Greater Antilles reported 1,000 Spaniards and\n12,000 African slaves on Hispaniola.[21]\n\nAs Spain conquered new regions on the mainland of the Americas ([Spanish\nMain](/wiki/Spanish_Main \"Spanish Main\")), its interest in Hispaniola waned,\nand the colony’s population grew slowly. By the early 17th century, the island\nand its smaller neighbors (notably [Tortuga](/wiki/Tortuga_\\(Haiti\\) \"Tortuga\n\\(Haiti\\)\")) became regular stopping points for [Caribbean\npirates](/wiki/Piracy_in_the_Caribbean \"Piracy in the Caribbean\"). In 1606,\nthe government of [Philip III](/wiki/Philip_III_of_Spain \"Philip III of\nSpain\") ordered all inhabitants of Hispaniola to move close to Santo Domingo,\nto avoid interaction with pirates. Rather than secure the island, his action\nmeant that French, English and Dutch pirates established their own bases on\nthe abandoned north and west coasts of the island.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Map_of_Hispaniola.JPG/300px-\nMap_of_Hispaniola.JPG)](/wiki/File:Map_of_Hispaniola.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Map_of_Hispaniola.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nFrench map of Hispaniola by Nicolas de Fer\n\nIn 1665, French colonization of the island was officially recognized by [King\nLouis XIV](/wiki/Louis_XIV \"Louis XIV\"). The French colony was given the name\n[Saint-Domingue](/wiki/Saint-Domingue \"Saint-Domingue\"). In the 1697 [Treaty\nof Ryswick](/wiki/Treaty_of_Ryswick \"Treaty of Ryswick\"), Spain formally ceded\nthe western third of the island to France.[22][23] Saint-Domingue quickly came\nto overshadow the east in both [wealth](/wiki/Wealth \"Wealth\") and\n[population](/wiki/Population \"Population\"). Nicknamed the \"Pearl of the\nAntilles,\" it became the richest and most prosperous colony in the [West\nIndies](/wiki/West_Indies \"West Indies\"), with a system of human enslavement\nused to grow and harvest sugar cane, during a time when demand for sugar was\nhigh in Europe. Slavery kept prices low and profit was maximized at the\nexpense of human lives. It was an important port in the Americas for goods and\nproducts flowing to and from France and Europe.\n\nWith the treaty of [Peace of Basel](/wiki/Peace_of_Basel \"Peace of Basel\"),\nrevolutionary France emerged as a major European power. In the second 1795\nTreaty of Basel (July 22), Spain ceded the eastern two-thirds of the island of\nHispaniola, later to become the Dominican Republic. French settlers had begun\nto colonize some areas in the Spanish side of the territory.\n\nEuropean colonists often died young due to tropical fevers, as well as from\nviolent slave resistance in the late eighteenth century. When the [French\nRevolution](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French Revolution\") abolished slavery in\nthe colonies on February 4, 1794, it was a European first,[24] and when\nNapoleon [reimposed slavery in 1802](/wiki/Law_of_20_May_1802 \"Law of 20 May\n1802\") it led to a major upheaval by the emancipated black slaves.\n\nThousands of the French troops sent by Napoleon to reestablish slavery\nsuccumbed to [yellow fever](/wiki/Yellow_fever \"Yellow fever\") during the\nsummer months, and more than half of the French army died because of\ndisease.[25] After the French removed the surviving 7,000 troops in late 1803,\nthe leaders of the revolution declared western Hispaniola the new nation of\nindependent Haiti in early 1804. France continued to rule Spanish Santo\nDomingo. In 1805, Haitian troops of General [Henri\nChristophe](/wiki/Henri_Christophe \"Henri Christophe\") tried to conquer all of\nHispaniola. They invaded Santo Domingo and sacked the towns of Santiago de los\nCaballeros and Moca, killing most of their residents, but news of a French\nfleet sailing towards Haiti forced General Christophe to return to Haiti,\nleaving the eastern Spanish side of the island in French hands. In 1808,\nfollowing Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the [criollos](/wiki/Criollo_people\n\"Criollo people\") of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule and, with the\naid of the United Kingdom (Spain's ally) returned Santo Domingo to Spanish\ncontrol.\n\nFearing the influence of a society that had successfully fought and won\nagainst their enslavers, the United States and European powers refused to\nrecognize Haiti, the second republic in the western hemisphere. France\ndemanded a high payment for compensation to slaveholders who lost their\nproperty, and Haiti was saddled with unmanageable debt for decades.[26] It\nbecame one of the poorest countries in the Americas, while the Dominican\nRepublic [26] gradually has developed into the largest economy of [Central\nAmerica](/wiki/Central_America \"Central America\") and the\n[Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean \"Caribbean\").\n\n## Geography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hispaniola&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Geography\")]\n\nSee also: [Geography of Haiti](/wiki/Geography_of_Haiti \"Geography of Haiti\")\nand [Geography of the Dominican\nRepublic](/wiki/Geography_of_the_Dominican_Republic \"Geography of the\nDominican Republic\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Hispaniola_lrg.jpg/300px-\nHispaniola_lrg.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hispaniola_lrg.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hispaniola_lrg.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTopographic map of Hispaniola\n\nHispaniola is the second-largest island in the [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean\n\"Caribbean\") (after [Cuba](/wiki/Cuba \"Cuba\")), with an area of 76,192 square\nkilometers (29,418 sq mi), 48,440 square kilometers (18,700 sq mi)[27] of\nwhich is under the sovereignty of the [Dominican\nRepublic](/wiki/Dominican_Republic \"Dominican Republic\") occupying the eastern\nportion and 27,750 square kilometers (10,710 sq mi)[6] under the sovereignty\nof [Haiti](/wiki/Haiti \"Haiti\") occupying the western portion.\n\nThe island of Cuba lies 80 kilometers (50 mi) to the northwest across the\n[Windward Passage](/wiki/Windward_Passage \"Windward Passage\"); to the\nsouthwest lies [Jamaica](/wiki/Jamaica \"Jamaica\"), separated by the [Jamaica\nChannel](/wiki/Jamaica_Channel \"Jamaica Channel\").

The [Hispaniolan pine\nforests](/wiki/Hispaniolan_pine_forests \"Hispaniolan pine forests\") occupy the\nmountainous 15% of the island, above 850 metres (2,790 ft) elevation. The\n[flooded grasslands and savannas](/wiki/Flooded_grasslands_and_savannas\n\"Flooded grasslands and savannas\") ecoregion in the south central region of\nthe island surrounds a chain of lakes and lagoons in which the most notable\ninclude that of [Lake Azuei](/wiki/Etang_Saumatre \"Etang Saumatre\") and [Trou\nCaïman](/wiki/Trou_Ca%C3%AFman \"Trou Caïman\") in Haiti and the nearby [Lake\nEnriquillo](/wiki/Lake_Enriquillo \"Lake Enriquillo\") in the Dominican\nRepublic.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Haiti_deforestation.jpg/235px-\nHaiti_deforestation.jpg)](/wiki/File:Haiti_deforestation.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Haiti_deforestation.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSatellite image depicting the border between [Haiti](/wiki/Haiti \"Haiti\")\n(left) and the [Dominican Republic](/wiki/Dominican_Republic \"Dominican\nRepublic\") (right)\n\nIn Haiti, [deforestation](/wiki/Deforestation_in_Haiti \"Deforestation in\nHaiti\") has long been cited by scientists as a source of ecological crisis;\nthe timber industry dates back to French colonial rule.\n\nHaiti has seen a dramatic reduction of forests due to the excessive and\nincreasing use of [charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal \"Charcoal\") as fuel for cooking.\nRecent in-depth studies of satellite imagery and environmental analysis\nregarding forest classification conclude an accurate estimate of approximately\n30% tree cover,[29] a stark decrease in the 60% forest cover in 1925. Despite\nrecent in-depth studies, the notoriously unsubstantiated 2% forest cover\nestimate has been widely circulated in media and in discourse concerning the\ncountry.[30] Despite the drastic underestimation of Haiti's forest cover, the\ncountry has been significantly deforested over the last 50 years, resulting in\nthe desertification of portions of the Haitian territory.\n\nIn the [Dominican Republic](/wiki/Dominican_Republic \"Dominican Republic\") the\nforest cover has increased. In 2003 the Dominican forest cover had been\nreduced to 32% of the territory, but in 2011 the trend towards reducing\nreverts to increase [forest](/wiki/Forest \"Forest\") cover by eight percentage\npoints to stand at nearly 40% of territory. The success of the Dominican\nforest growth is due to several Dominican government policies and private\norganizations for the purpose, and a strong educational campaign that has\nresulted in increased awareness on the [Dominican\npeople](/wiki/People_of_the_Dominican_Republic \"People of the Dominican\nRepublic\") of the importance of forests for their welfare and in other forms\nof life on the [island](/wiki/Island \"Island\").[31]\n\n### Climate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hispaniola&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Climate\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Cordillera_Central.jpg/220px-\nCordillera_Central.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cordillera_Central.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cordillera_Central.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Cordillera Central](/wiki/Cordillera_Central,_Dominican_Republic \"Cordillera\nCentral, Dominican Republic\"), Dominican Republic\n\nOwing to its mountainous topography, Hispaniola’s climate shows considerable\nvariation over short distances, and is the most varied of all the\n[Antilles](/wiki/Antilles \"Antilles\").[32]\n\nExcept in the Northern Hemisphere summer season, the predominant winds over\nHispaniola are the northeast [trade winds](/wiki/Trade_winds \"Trade winds\").\nAs in Jamaica and Cuba, these winds deposit their moisture on the northern\nmountains, and create a distinct [rain shadow](/wiki/Rain_shadow \"Rain\nshadow\") on the southern coast, where some areas receive as little as 400\nmillimetres (16 in) of rainfall, and have [semi-arid climates](/wiki/Semi-\narid_climate \"Semi-arid climate\"). Annual rainfall under 600 millimetres (24\nin) also occurs on the southern coast of Haiti’s northwest peninsula and in\nthe central Azúa region of the _Plaine du Cul-de-Sac_. In these regions,\nmoreover, there is generally little rainfall outside hurricane season from\nAugust to October, and droughts are by no means uncommon when hurricanes do\nnot come.[33]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/View_of_Haitian_Landscape_hispaniola.jpg/220px-\nView_of_Haitian_Landscape_hispaniola.jpg)](/wiki/File:View_of_Haitian_Landscape_hispaniola.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:View_of_Haitian_Landscape_hispaniola.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Les Cayes](/wiki/Les_Cayes \"Les Cayes\"), [Sud](/wiki/Sud_\\(department\\) \"Sud\n\\(department\\)\"), Haiti\n\nOn the northern coast, in contrast, rainfall may peak between December and\nFebruary, though some rain falls in all months of the year. Annual amounts\ntypically range from 1,700 to 2,000 millimetres (67 to 79 in) on the northern\ncoastal lowlands;[32] there is probably much more in the [Cordillera\nSeptentrional](/wiki/Cordillera_Septentrional \"Cordillera Septentrional\"),\nthough no data exist.\n\nThe interior of Hispaniola, along with the southeastern coast centred around\nSanto Domingo, typically receives around 1,400 millimetres (55 in) per year,\nwith a distinct wet season from May to October. Usually, this wet season has\ntwo peaks: one around May, the other around the hurricane season. In the\ninterior highlands, rainfall is much greater, around 3,100 millimetres (120\nin) per year, but with a similar pattern to that observed in the central\nlowlands.\n\nAs is usual for tropical islands, variations of temperature are much less\nmarked than rainfall variations, and depend only on altitude. Lowland\nHispaniola is generally oppressively hot and humid, with temperatures\naveraging 28 °C (82 °F). with high humidity during the daytime, and around 20\n°C (68 °F) at night. At higher altitudes, temperatures fall steadily, so that\n[frosts](/wiki/Frost \"Frost\") occur during the dry season on the highest\npeaks, where maxima are no higher than 18 °C (64 °F).\n\n## Demographics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hispaniola&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Demographics\")]\n\nThe Dominican Republic is a [Hispanophone](/wiki/Hispanophone \"Hispanophone\")\nnation of approximately 10 million people. Spanish is spoken by all Dominicans\nas a primary language. Roman Catholicism is the official and dominant\nreligion.\n\nHaiti is a [Francophone](/wiki/Geographical_distribution_of_French_speakers\n\"Geographical distribution of French speakers\") nation of roughly 10 million\npeople. Although French is spoken as a primary language by the educated and\nwealthy minority, virtually the entire population speaks [Haitian\nCreole](/wiki/Haitian_Creole \"Haitian Creole\"), one of several French-derived\ncreole languages. Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion, practiced by\nmore than half the population, although in some cases in combination with\n[Haitian Vodou](/wiki/Haitian_Vodou \"Haitian Vodou\") faith. Another 25% of the\npopulace belong to [Protestant](/wiki/Protestantism \"Protestantism\")\nchurches.[34] Haiti emerged as the first Black republic[35] in the world.\n\n### Ethnic\ncomposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hispaniola&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Ethnic composition\")]\n\nThe ethnic composition of the Dominican population is 73% mixed\n(African/European), 16% white and 11% black.\n\nThe ethnic composition of Haiti is estimated to be 95% black, 5% white and\nmixed.\n\n## Economics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hispaniola&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Economics\")]\n\nThe island has the largest economy in the [Greater\nAntilles](/wiki/Greater_Antilles \"Greater Antilles\"), however most of the\neconomic development is found in the Dominican Republic, the Dominican economy\nbeing nearly 800% larger than the Haitian economy.\n\nThe estimated [annual per capita\nincome](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\\(PPP\\)_per_capita \"List of countries\nby GDP \\(PPP\\) per capita\") is US$1,300 in Haiti and US$8,200 in Dominican\nRepublic.[36]\n\nThe divergence between the level of economic development between\n[Haiti](/wiki/Haiti \"Haiti\") and [Dominican Republic](/wiki/Dominican_Republic\n\"Dominican Republic\") makes its border the higher contrast of all western land\nborders and is evident that the Dominican Republic has one of the highest\nmigration issues in the Americas.[37]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Geologic_Map_Dominican_Republic.png/500px-\nGeologic_Map_Dominican_Republic.png)](/wiki/File:Geologic_Map_Dominican_Republic.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Geologic_Map_Dominican_Republic.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Geologic map](/wiki/Geologic_map \"Geologic map\") of Hispaniola.

Traveling further\neast from Navidad, Columbus came across the [Yaque del Norte\nRiver](/wiki/Yaque_del_Norte_River \"Yaque del Norte River\"), which he named\nRio de Oro because its \"sands abound in gold dust.\"[38]\n\nOn Columbus' return during his second voyage he learned it was the cacique\nCaonabo, \"lord of the mines\", who had massacred his settlement at Navidad.\nWhile Columbus established a new settlement at [La Isabela](/wiki/La_Isabela\n\"La Isabela\") on Jan. 1494, he sent [Alonso de Ojeda](/wiki/Alonso_de_Ojeda\n\"Alonso de Ojeda\") and 15 men to search for the \"mines of Cibao.\" After a six-\nday journey, Ojeda came across an area \"very rich in gold\", in which the\n\"Indians took gold out of a brook...and many other streams in that province.\"\nColumbus himself visited the mines of Cibao on 12 March 1494. He constructed\nthe Fort of Santo Tomas, present day [Janico](/wiki/Janico \"Janico\"), with\nCaptain Pedro Margarit in command of 56 men.[38]:119,122–126\n\nOn 24 March 1495, Columbus with his ally [Guacanagarix](/wiki/Guacanagarix\n\"Guacanagarix\"), embarked on a war of revenge against Caonabo, capturing him\nand his family while \"killing many Indians and capturing others.\" Afterwards,\n\"every person of fourteen years of age or upward was to pay a large hawk's\nbell of gold dust.\"[38]:149–150\n\nMiguel Diaz and [Francisco de Garay](/wiki/Francisco_de_Garay \"Francisco de\nGaray\") discovered large [gold nuggets](/wiki/Gold_nugget \"Gold nugget\") on\nthe lower [Haina River](/wiki/Haina_River \"Haina River\") in 1496. These San\nCristobal mines were later known as the Minas Viejas mines. Then, in 1499, the\nfirst major discovery of gold was made in the [cordillera](/wiki/Cordillera\n\"Cordillera\") central, which led to a mining boom. By 1501, Columbus' cousin\nGiovanni Colombo, had discovered gold near Buenaventura, the deposits were\nlater known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along [San\nCristobal](/wiki/San_Cristobal,_Dominican_Republic \"San Cristobal, Dominican\nRepublic\")-Buenaventura, and another in Cibao within the [La\nVega](/wiki/La_Vega,_Dominican_Republic \"La Vega, Dominican\nRepublic\")-Cotuy-[Bonao](/wiki/Bonao \"Bonao\") triangle, while [Santiago de los\nCaballeros](/wiki/Santiago_de_los_Caballeros \"Santiago de los Caballeros\"),\n[Concepcion](/wiki/La_Vega,_Dominican_Republic \"La Vega, Dominican Republic\"),\nand Bonao became mining towns. The [gold rush](/wiki/Gold_rush \"Gold rush\") of\n1500–1508 ensued.[20]\n\n[Ferdinand](/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon \"Ferdinand II of Aragon\") \"ordered\ngold from the richest mines reserved for the Crown.\" Thus, Ovando expropriated\nthe gold mines of Miguel Diaz and Francisco de Garay in 1504, as pit mines\nbecame royal mines, though [placers](/wiki/Placer_mining \"Placer mining\") were\nopen to private prospectors. Furthermore, Ferdinand wanted the \"best Indians\"\nworking his royal mines, and kept 967 in the San Cristobal mining area\nsupervised by salaried miners.[20]:68,71,78,125–127\n\nUnder [Nicolás de Ovando y\nCáceres](/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_de_Ovando_y_C%C3%A1ceres \"Nicolás de Ovando y\nCáceres\")' governorship, the Indians were made to work in the gold mines,\n\"where they were grossly overworked, mistreated, and underfed,\" according to\nPons. By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work\nthe mines as part of the [encomienda](/wiki/Encomienda \"Encomienda\") system.\nAccording to Pons, \"Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease\nliterally wiped them out.\" By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was\nreduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained. About half were located\nin the mining towns of Concepcion, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura.\nThe [repartimiento](/wiki/Repartimiento \"Repartimiento\") of 1514 accelerated\nemigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines.\nIn 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000, of the remaining\n11,000 Indians, in one month. By 1519, according to Pons, \"Both the gold\neconomy and the Indian population became extinct at the same\ntime.\"[39][20]:191–192\n\nHowever, writing in 1860, Courtney observed, the island is \"one immense gold\nfield\", of which the early Spaniards had \"scarcely began to be developed.\"\nAdditionally, \"The gold is still found in the Cibao regions as of old.\"[40] By\n1919, Condit and Ross noted \"the greater part of the Republic is covered by\nconcessions granted by the government for mining minerals of diverse sorts.\"\nBesides gold, these minerals included silver, manganese, copper, magnetite,\niron and nickel.[41]\n\nMining operations in 2016 have taken advantage of the [volcanogenic massive\nsulfide ore deposits](/wiki/Volcanogenic_massive_sulfide_ore_deposit\n\"Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit\") (VMS) around\n[Maimón](/wiki/Maim%C3%B3n \"Maimón\"). To the northeast, the Pueblo Viejo Gold\nMine was operated by state-owned Rosario Dominicana from 1975 until 1991. In\n2009, Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Corporation, formed by [Barrick\nGold](/wiki/Barrick_Gold \"Barrick Gold\") and [Goldcorp](/wiki/Goldcorp\n\"Goldcorp\"), started [open-pit mining](/wiki/Open-pit_mining \"Open-pit\nmining\") operations of the Monte Negro and Moore oxide deposits.
