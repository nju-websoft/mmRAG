I laughed, I cried, and I didn't expect either from a show about a\nlittle girl.\"[37] Gwen Inhat of _[The A.V. Club](/wiki/The_A.V._Club \"The A.V.\nClub\")_ calls the series \"at once darker and sweeter than the original\" novel,\npraising the core cast, reserving the highest for the series lead: \"Amybeth\nMcNulty defies her youth with a performance that's less a portrayal of Anne\nthan an absolute possession. It can't be easy to make Anne's fanciful language\nsing the way she does, and McNulty captures the endearing awkwardness that\nenables Anne to win over everyone she comes in contact with.\"[38] Writing of\nthe 90-minute premiere episode for the _[Toronto Star](/wiki/Toronto_Star\n\"Toronto Star\")_ , [Johanna Schneller](/wiki/Johanna_Schneller \"Johanna\nSchneller\") was appreciative of Walley-Beckett's departures from the novel,\nbringing its [subtext](/wiki/Subtext \"Subtext\") to the fore: \"Reading between\nthe novel's lines and adding [verisimilitude](/wiki/Verisimilitude\n\"Verisimilitude\"), she gives us quick but potent glimpses of the miseries many\norphans faced in 1890s imperialist culture.\"[39] Hanh Nguyen, reviewing the\nseries for [IndieWire](/wiki/IndieWire \"IndieWire\"), concurs with this\nassessment, saying: \"Rather than ruining the series, they give the context for\nwhy Anne would be filled with gratitude for the beauties of nature, basic\nhuman decency and having a family to call her own. Montgomery had based much\nof Anne's need for escape into imagination on her own lonely childhood, and\nher stories have always had an underlying poignancy that made them all the\nsweeter.\"[40] Jen Chaney, writing for\n[Vulture.com](/wiki/New_York_Magazine#Digital_expansion_and_blogs \"New York\nMagazine\"), agrees, saying: \"What distinguishes it from other previous Anne\niterations is its willingness to harden some of the story's softness, just\nenough, to create an element of realism that period pieces, Gables-related or\nnot, can be inclined to avoid.\"[41] [Neil Genzlinger](/wiki/Neil_Genzlinger\n\"Neil Genzlinger\") writing for _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times\n\"The New York Times\")_ , commenting on reports of darkness and grittiness,\ngoes so far as to call the adaptation \"richer\" than the source material: \"Ms.\nMcNulty's Anne is still wonderfully ebullient and eminently likable; she's\njust not the one-dimensional figure of other adaptations\".[42] Annie\nHirschlag, writing for [Mic](/wiki/Mic_\\(media_company\\) \"Mic \\(media\ncompany\\)\"), suggests that a genuinely contemporary _Anne_ is bound to reflect\nthe current television landscape and wider culture of its times (the 2010s):\n\"Since today's entertainment is peppered with antiheroes — characters who are\nfar from perfect, even occasionally villainous — it makes sense that Anne's\nfamiliar idealism is fringed with darkness and agony.\"[43]\n\nSome reviewers were more ambivalent, mainly about Walley-Beckett's changes to\nthe story. Canadian novelist [Saleema Nawaz](/wiki/Saleema_Nawaz \"Saleema\nNawaz\"), who reviewed the 90-minute first episode for _[Toronto\nLife](/wiki/Toronto_Life \"Toronto Life\")_ , said she enjoyed it more than she\nexpected, particularly the set designs and costumes, as well as the\nperformances by McNulty and Thomson, and she approved of the choice of theme\nsong as reflective of the continued relevance of the source material. She was\nless sure about how far the series intended to stray from that source\nmaterial, and disapproved of the \"manufactured drama, such as Matthew's wild\nhorse ride\".[44] Writing for _[Entertainment\nWeekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\")_ , Isabella\nBeidenharn expressed similar feelings, but, \"putting the source material\naside, it's a fine show on its own\", and she conceded that \"inventing a dark\nside might help _Anne With an E_ fit into today's TV landscape\".[45] Allison\nKeene, writing for [Collider](/wiki/Collider_\\(website\\) \"Collider\n\\(website\\)\"), agrees that _Anne_ is a good drama on its own terms, but allows\nit is \"only a fair adaptation\" of the novel, at its best in the home scenes:\n\"_Anne with an E_ is undeniably the most stylish adaptation we've ever seen of\n_Anne of Green Gables_. But its desire to reveal more of Anne's miserable past\nin order to be more true to what the desperation of an orphan is like feels at\nodds with Montgomery's story.\"[46] Writing for\n_[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_ , critic Sonia\nSaraiya is even more ambivalent, describing the series as on the one hand \"a\nbrilliant adaptation\" which \"succeeds admirably\", but on the other hand, \"the\nshow can't quite sustain the brilliance, veering first into maudlin territory\nand then into the oddly saccharine as it tests out its tone\", contending that\n\"the show gets a bit bogged down in telling the story of Anne's dysfunction\",\npresenting \"a slightly soapy view of Anne's trials and tribulations that at\ntimes really humanize her and in others, are rather infantilizing\".[47]\n\nSarah Larson, writing for _[The New Yorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker \"The New\nYorker\")_ , was not at all impressed with changes made to the story, arguing\nthat they alter Anne's character to the point of non-recognition. While she\nacknowledges that bringing subtext to the fore is a fine idea, she is not\npleased with the execution, saying that the result is part \"the Anne we know\nand love\" and part \"untrustworthy stranger\", calling the alteration and\naddition of scenes a \"betrayal\" of Montgomery's novel, comparing the treatment\nunfavourably to [Patricia Rozema](/wiki/Patricia_Rozema \"Patricia Rozema\")'s\n[1999 adaptation](/wiki/Mansfield_Park_\\(film\\) \"Mansfield Park \\(film\\)\") of\n[Jane Austen](/wiki/Jane_Austen \"Jane Austen\")'s _[Mansfield\nPark](/wiki/Mansfield_Park \"Mansfield Park\")_.[48] For Joanna Robinson,\nwriting for _[Vanity Fair](/wiki/Vanity_Fair_magazine \"Vanity Fair magazine\")_\n, a central problem with the show is that it \"seems to think that in order for\nAnne to be a feminist figure, she has to butt up against a straw-man-filled\npatriarchy,\" and so it turned many of the male characters into\n[misogynists](/wiki/Misogynists \"Misogynists\"), most notably the Reverend\nAllan, who is considered by Anne to be a \"kindred spirit\" in the book: \"_Anne\nwith an E_ seems to think Anne's triumphs are only noteworthy if she's\ncontinually told she can't succeed, when in fact her unfettered brilliance\nneeds no such clumsy opposition. It also seems to think that Anne needs a\nradical feminist makeover when, in fact, the story of her success was feminist\nin its own right.\" This is part of a more general problem Robinson notes, that\nconflicts are exaggerated and overdone: \"this series thrives on non-stop\ntragedy.\"[49]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Anne_with_an_E&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Anne of Green Gables set for new life on CBC-TV\"](http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/anne-of-green-gables-cbc-tv-1.3394073). _CBC.ca_.
