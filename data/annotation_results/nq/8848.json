They were\nthe initial patrons of [Satsuma ware](/wiki/Satsuma_ware \"Satsuma ware\"),\nwhich was later widely exported to the West.\n\nIn 1871, with the [abolition of feudal\ndomains](/wiki/Abolition_of_the_han_system \"Abolition of the han system\") and\nthe establishment of [prefectures](/wiki/Prefectures \"Prefectures\") after the\n[Meiji Restoration](/wiki/Meiji_Restoration \"Meiji Restoration\"), the\nprovinces of Satsuma and [Ōsumi](/wiki/%C5%8Csumi_Province \"Ōsumi Province\")\nwere combined to eventually establish Kagoshima Prefecture.\n\nSatsuma was one of the main provinces that rose in opposition to the [Tokugawa\nshogunate](/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate \"Tokugawa shogunate\") in the mid 19th\ncentury. Because of this, the [oligarchy](/wiki/Meiji_oligarchy \"Meiji\noligarchy\") that came into power after the [Meiji\nRestoration](/wiki/Meiji_Restoration \"Meiji Restoration\") of 1868 had a strong\nrepresentation from the Satsuma province, with leaders such as [Ōkubo\nToshimichi](/wiki/%C5%8Ckubo_Toshimichi \"Ōkubo Toshimichi\") and [Saigō\nTakamori](/wiki/Saig%C5%8D_Takamori \"Saigō Takamori\") taking up key government\npositions.\n\nSatsuma is well known for its production of [sweet\npotatoes](/wiki/Sweet_potato \"Sweet potato\"), known in Japan as 薩摩芋 (satsuma-\nimo or \"Satsuma potato\"). On the other hand, Satsuma mandarins (known as\n[_mikan_](/wiki/Citrus_unshiu \"Citrus unshiu\") in Japan) do not specifically\noriginate from Satsuma but were imported into the West through this province\nin the Meiji era.\n\n## Historical\ndistricts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Satsuma_Province&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Historical districts\")]\n\n  * [Kagoshima Prefecture](/wiki/Kagoshima_Prefecture \"Kagoshima Prefecture\")\n    * [Ata District](/w/index.php?title=Ata_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Ata District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (阿多郡) - merged into Hioki District on March 29, 1896\n    * [Ei District](/w/index.php?title=Ei_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Ei District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (頴娃郡) - merged into Ibusuki District (along with parts of Kiire District) on March 29, 1896\n    * [Hioki District](/wiki/Hioki_District,_Kagoshima \"Hioki District, Kagoshima\") (日置郡) - absorbed Ata District on March 29, 1896; now dissolved\n    * [Ibusuki District](/wiki/Ibusuki_District,_Kagoshima \"Ibusuki District, Kagoshima\") (揖宿郡) - absorbed Ei and parts of Kiire Districts on March 29, 1896; now dissolved\n    * [Isa District](/w/index.php?title=Isa_District,_Satsuma&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Isa District, Satsuma \\(page does not exist\\)\") (囎唹郡) \n      * [Kitaisa District](/w/index.php?title=Kitaisa_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kitaisa District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (北伊佐郡) - merged with [Hishikari District](/w/index.php?title=Hishikari_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Hishikari District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (菱刈郡) of [Ōsumi Province](/wiki/%C5%8Csumi_Province \"Ōsumi Province\") to become the 2nd incarnation of [Isa District](/wiki/Isa_District,_Kagoshima \"Isa District, Kagoshima\") (伊佐郡) on March 29, 1896\n      * [Minamiisa District](/w/index.php?title=Minamiisa_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Minamiisa District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (東囎唹郡) - merged into Satsuma District (along with Koshikijima and Taki Districts) on March 29, 1896\n    * [Izaku District](/w/index.php?title=Izaku_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Izaku District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (伊作郡) - merged into Ata District prior the [Meiji period](/wiki/Meiji_period \"Meiji period\")\n    * [Izumi District](/wiki/Izumi_District,_Kagoshima \"Izumi District, Kagoshima\") (出水郡)\n    * [Kagoshima District](/wiki/Kagoshima_District,_Kagoshima \"Kagoshima District, Kagoshima\") (鹿児島郡) - absorbed [Kitaōsumi District](/w/index.php?title=Kita%C5%8Dsumi_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kitaōsumi District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (北大隅郡) of Ōsumi Province and Taniyama District of Satsuma Province on March 29, 1896\n    * [Kawanabe District](/wiki/Kawanabe_District,_Kagoshima \"Kawanabe District, Kagoshima\") (川辺郡) - absorbed remaining parts of Kiire District (the village of Chiran) on March 29, 1896; now dissolved\n    * [Koshikijima District](/w/index.php?title=Koshikijima_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Koshikijima District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (甑島郡) - merged into Satsuma District (along with Minamiisa and Taki Districts) on March 29, 1896\n    * [Kiire District](/w/index.php?title=Kiire_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kiire District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (給黎郡) - split and merged into Kawanabe and Ibusuki Districts on March 29, 1896\n    * [Satsuma District](/wiki/Satsuma_District,_Kagoshima \"Satsuma District, Kagoshima\") (薩摩郡) - absorbed Koshikijima, Minamiisa and Taki Districts on March 29, 1896\n    * [Taki District](/w/index.php?title=Taki_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Taki District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (高城郡) - merged into Satsuma District (along with Koshikijima and Minamiisa Districts) on March 29, 1896\n    * [Taniyama District](/w/index.php?title=Taniyama_District,_Kagoshima&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Taniyama District, Kagoshima \\(page does not exist\\)\") (谿山郡) - merged into Kagoshima District (along with Kitaōsumi District of Ōsumi Province) on March 29, 1896\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Satsuma_Province&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Shimazu clan](/wiki/Shimazu_clan \"Shimazu clan\")\n  * [Satsuma Domain](/wiki/Satsuma_Domain \"Satsuma Domain\")\n  * [Japanese battleship Satsuma](/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Satsuma \"Japanese battleship Satsuma\")\n  * [History of Kagoshima Prefecture](/wiki/History_of_Kagoshima_Prefecture \"History of Kagoshima Prefecture\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Satsuma_Province&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric](/wiki/Louis-Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric \"Louis-Frédéric\").
