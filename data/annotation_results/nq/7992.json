In\n_Ant-Man_ , Lang must help defend Pym's Ant-Man shrinking technology and plot\na heist with worldwide ramifications.\n\nDevelopment of _Ant-Man_ began in April 2006, with the hiring of Wright to\ndirect and co-write with Cornish. By April 2011, Wright and Cornish had\ncompleted three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film\nin July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so\nthat Wright could complete _[The World's End](/wiki/The_World%27s_End_\\(film\\)\n\"The World's End \\(film\\)\")_. Casting began in December 2013, with the hiring\nof Rudd to play Lang. In May 2014, Wright left the project, citing creative\ndifferences, though he still received screenplay and story credits with\nCornish, as well as an executive producer credit. The following month, Reed\nwas brought in to replace Wright, while McKay was hired to contribute to the\nscript with Rudd. Principal photography took place between August and December\n2014 in San Francisco and [Metro Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta_metropolitan_area\n\"Atlanta metropolitan area\").\n\n_Ant-Man_ held its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 29, 2015, and was\nreleased in the United States on July 17, 2015, in [3D](/wiki/3D_film \"3D\nfilm\") and [IMAX 3D](/wiki/IMAX_3D \"IMAX 3D\"). Upon its release, the film\ngrossed more than $519 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from\ncritics, who generally welcomed the film's smaller stakes than preceding MCU\ninstallments, as well as its cast, humor, and CGI sequences.

Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long\nas he lives.\n\nIn the present day,[N 1] Pym's estranged daughter, [Hope van\nDyne](/wiki/Hope_Pym \"Hope Pym\"), and former protégé, [Darren\nCross](/wiki/Darren_Cross \"Darren Cross\"), have forced him out of his company,\nPym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own,\nthe [Yellowjacket](/wiki/Yellowjacket_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Yellowjacket \\(Marvel\nComics\\)\"), which horrifies Pym.\n\nUpon his release from prison, well-meaning thief [Scott Lang](/wiki/Ant-\nMan_\\(Scott_Lang\\) \"Ant-Man \\(Scott Lang\\)\") moves in with his old cellmate,\nLuis. Lang visits his daughter [Cassie](/wiki/Cassandra_Lang \"Cassandra Lang\")\nunannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-\ndetective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold a\njob because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit\na burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what\nhe believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying\nthe suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect.\nTerrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested\non the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit\ninto his cell to help him break out.\n\nPym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as\na test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from\nCross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, van Dyne\nand Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While van Dyne harbors\nresentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet,\nknown as the [Wasp](/wiki/Wasp_\\(comics\\) \"Wasp \\(comics\\)\"), disappeared into\na subatomic [quantum\nrealm](/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe#Extradimensional_places \"Features\nof the Marvel Universe\") while disabling a [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet\nUnion\") nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if\nhe overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will\naid their heist from the [Avengers](/wiki/Avengers_\\(comics\\) \"Avengers\n\\(comics\\)\")' headquarters, where he briefly fights [Sam\nWilson](/wiki/Falcon_\\(comics\\) \"Falcon \\(comics\\)\").\n\nCross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym\nTechnologies' headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying\nants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's\n[servers](/wiki/Server_\\(computing\\) \"Server \\(computing\\)\"), and plants\nexplosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and\nHope, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and\nAnt-Man suits to [Hydra](/wiki/Hydra_\\(comics\\) \"Hydra \\(comics\\)\"). Lang\nbreaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one\nflees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross,\nwhile the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and van Dyne\nescape.\n\nCross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by\nPaxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang\noverrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit\nand sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into\nthe quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the\n[macroscopic](/wiki/Macroscopic_scale \"Macroscopic scale\") world. Out of\ngratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of\nprison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym\nwonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who\ntells him that Wilson is looking for him.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pym shows van Dyne a new Wasp prototype suit and\noffers it to her. In a [post-credits scene](/wiki/Post-credits_scene \"Post-\ncredits scene\"), Wilson and [Steve Rogers](/wiki/Captain_America \"Captain\nAmerica\") have [Bucky Barnes](/wiki/Bucky_Barnes \"Bucky Barnes\") in their\ncustody.

I took the [Chris\nPratt](/wiki/Chris_Pratt \"Chris Pratt\") approach to training for an action\nmovie. Eliminate anything fun for a year and then you can play a hero.\"[11]\nRudd signed a multi-film contract with Marvel, with Feige saying it was \"three\n[films]-plus-plus to appear in other things.\"[12]\n\n  * [Evangeline Lilly](/wiki/Evangeline_Lilly \"Evangeline Lilly\") as [Hope van Dyne](/wiki/Hope_Pym \"Hope Pym\"):  \nThe daughter of Hank Pym and [Janet van Dyne](/wiki/Wasp_\\(comics\\) \"Wasp\n\\(comics\\)\") and a senior board member of Pym Technologies, who helps Darren\nCross take over the company.[13][14][15][16][17] Throughout the film,\ncharacter progression brings Hope closer to becoming a hero.[18] Lilly\ndescribed her character as \"capable, strong, and kick-ass\", but said that\nbeing raised by two superheroes resulted in Hope being \"a pretty screwed up\nhuman being... and the clear message sent by my name is that I'm not a big fan\nof my father and so I took my mother's name.\"[19] She added that van Dyne's\n\"arc in the movie is trying to find a relationship\" with Pym.[10] Originally\ncast by Wright, Lilly was reluctant to take the role after he left the project\nuntil she read the revised script and got a chance to meet with Reed.[15]\nFeige said that van Dyne was the more obvious choice to take up the mantle of\nAnt-Man, being \"infinitely more capable of actually being a superhero\" than\nLang, and that the reason she does not is because of Pym's experience with\nlosing her mother, rather than sexism, which Feige felt would not be a problem\nfor Pym in modern times. Lilly signed a multi-film contract with Marvel.[20]\n\n  * [Corey Stoll](/wiki/Corey_Stoll \"Corey Stoll\") as [Darren Cross](/wiki/Darren_Cross \"Darren Cross\") / [Yellowjacket](/wiki/Yellowjacket_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Yellowjacket \\(Marvel Comics\\)\"):  \nA former protégé of Pym's, who takes over his mentor's company and militarizes\na similar version of the Ant-Man technology to create the Yellowjacket\nsuit.[14][16][21][22] Stoll described the suit as \"the next generation of Ant-\nMan's suit\", with a sleeker, more militaristic look as \"if\n[Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\") had designed a battle suit.\"[23] As for\nhis character, Stoll said that Cross was more like Hank Pym than\n\"[Thanos](/wiki/Thanos \"Thanos\") or [Loki](/wiki/Loki_\\(comics\\) \"Loki\n\\(comics\\)\"), who are villains that know it\", since Cross is a \"brilliant\nscientist, who is not ethically pure\" with shades of gray.[24] Unlike Rudd,\nwho wore a practical costume as Ant-Man, Stoll wore a [motion\ncapture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion capture\") suit while performing as\nYellowjacket. Reed explained that this decision was made early on when\ncreating and filming with a real Yellowjacket costume was found to be\nimpractical.[25]\n\n  * [Bobby Cannavale](/wiki/Bobby_Cannavale \"Bobby Cannavale\") as Paxton:  \nA [San Francisco Police Department](/wiki/San_Francisco_Police_Department \"San\nFrancisco Police Department\") officer who is engaged to Lang's former wife\nMaggie.[17][26] Cannavale stated that Rudd and McKay convinced him to join the\nfilm during the rewriting process before Marvel approached him, saying, \"They\nsort of pumped [my] part up a bit...I really went on good faith [taking the\nrole] because they're so secretive [at Marvel] about the script. I just\ntrusted them.\" He also added that the process felt like an indie film instead\nof a large-scale blockbuster, and that he was able to improvise frequently\nalong with the other actors.[26] [Patrick\nWilson](/wiki/Patrick_Wilson_\\(American_actor\\) \"Patrick Wilson \\(American\nactor\\)\") was originally cast in the role,[27] before leaving the film because\nof scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay.[28]\n\n  * [Michael Peña](/wiki/Michael_Pe%C3%B1a \"Michael Peña\") as [Luis](/wiki/Luis_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Luis \\(Marvel Comics\\)\"):  \nLang's former cellmate and a member of his crew.[29][30] Peña stated that he\nmodeled Luis' vocal style and positive outlook on life \"on a friend of a\nfriend\", saying, \"That's just the way he talks and the cadence.

However, [Walt Disney\nPictures](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures \"Walt Disney Pictures\") was developing a\nfilm based on a similar concept, _[Honey, I Shrunk the\nKids](/wiki/Honey,_I_Shrunk_the_Kids \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\")_ , and\nalthough _Ant-Man_ went into development, nothing came to fruition.[61]\n\nIn 2000, [Howard Stern](/wiki/Howard_Stern \"Howard Stern\") met with Marvel in\nan attempt to purchase the film rights to Ant-Man.[62] In May of that year,\n[Artisan Entertainment](/wiki/Artisan_Entertainment \"Artisan Entertainment\")\nannounced a deal with Marvel to coproduce, finance, and distribute a film\nbased on Ant-Man.[63] In 2003, [Edgar Wright](/wiki/Edgar_Wright \"Edgar\nWright\") and his writing partner [Joe Cornish](/wiki/Joe_Cornish \"Joe\nCornish\") wrote a treatment for Artisan, with Wright explaining that it\nrevolved around [Scott Lang](/wiki/Scott_Lang \"Scott Lang\") as a burglar \"so\nhe could have gone slightly in the [Elmore Leonard](/wiki/Elmore_Leonard\n\"Elmore Leonard\") route\", though Artisan wanted the film to be \"like a family\nthing\". However, Wright believed that the treatment was never sent to\nMarvel.[64] A year later, the duo pitched the film to [Marvel\nStudios](/wiki/Marvel_Studios \"Marvel Studios\")' then head of production,\n[Kevin Feige](/wiki/Kevin_Feige \"Kevin Feige\").[10] In April 2006, Marvel\nStudios hired Wright to direct and co-write _Ant-Man_ with Cornish as part of\nthe company's first slate of independently produced films. Wright would also\nco-produce the film with his [Big Talk Productions](/wiki/Big_Talk_Productions\n\"Big Talk Productions\") partner [Nira Park](/wiki/Nira_Park \"Nira Park\").[65]\n\n\"The thing I like about Ant-Man is that it's not like a secret power, there's\nno supernatural element or it's not a genetic thing. There's no gamma rays.\nIt's just like the suit and the gas, so in that sense, it really appealed to\nme in terms that we could do something high-concept, really visual, cross-\ngenre, sort of an action and special effects bonanza, but funny as well.\"\n\n—Screenwriter Edgar Wright[66]\n\nAt the 2006 [San Diego Comic-Con International](/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-\nCon_International \"San Diego Comic-Con International\"), Wright said he was\nintrigued by the story's high concept and character. Wright also stressed that\nthe film would not be a [spoof](/wiki/Spoof_film \"Spoof film\") but an action-\nadventure with some comedic elements and would incorporate both the [Hank\nPym](/wiki/Hank_Pym \"Hank Pym\") and Scott Lang incarnations of the\ncharacter.[67] Wright said that he was looking to \"do a prologue where you see\nPym as Ant-Man in action in the 60s, in sort of _[Tales to\nAstonish](/wiki/Tales_to_Astonish \"Tales to Astonish\")_ mode basically, and\nthen the contemporary, sort of flash-forward, is Scott Lang's story, and how\nhe comes to acquire the suit, how he crosses paths with Hank Pym, and then, in\nan interesting sort of Machiavellian way, teams up with him.\"[66] The next\nFebruary, Wright said that the project was in \"a holding pattern\" while the\nscript was being revised,[68] and that he had been doing research for the film\nby studying [nanotechnology](/wiki/Nanotechnology \"Nanotechnology\").[69] In\nMarch 2008, Wright said that the first draft of the script had been completed\nand he was working on the second.[70]\n\n[Stan Lee](/wiki/Stan_Lee \"Stan Lee\") [tweeted](/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\") in\nFebruary 2010 that Marvel was prepping the film and that he met with Wright\nfor lunch to discuss the character.[71] Wright noted that there was no\ntimetable for the film because Marvel did not consider the character to be one\nof their bigger, tentpole properties, so \"It's more like me and Kevin Feige\nsaying...'Let's make a good script that works, that's all about a great genre\nfilm, and that isn't necessarily relying on anything else'\".[72] At the 2010\nSan Diego Comic-Con International, Wright said that Ant-Man would not fit in\nthe chronology of _[The Avengers](/wiki/The_Avengers_\\(2012_film\\) \"The\nAvengers \\(2012 film\\)\")_ due to the origin story he had written not working\nin the MCU.[73] In January 2011, Wright stated that he had resumed writing the\nscript for the film following the conclusion of the international promotion\nfor _[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World](/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World \"Scott\nPilgrim vs. the World\")_ ,[74] and by April he and Cornish delivered the\nsecond draft of _Ant-Man_ to Marvel.[75] At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con\nInternational, Wright revealed a third draft had been handed in.[76]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/San_Diego_Comic-\nCon_2012_-_Ant-Man_announcement.jpg/220px-San_Diego_Comic-Con_2012_-_Ant-\nMan_announcement.jpg)](/wiki/File:San_Diego_Comic-Con_2012_-_Ant-\nMan_announcement.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:San_Diego_Comic-Con_2012_-_Ant-Man_announcement.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n(L-R) moderator Geoff Boucher, producer [Kevin Feige](/wiki/Kevin_Feige \"Kevin\nFeige\") and Wright at the 2012 [San Diego Comic-Con\nInternational](/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International \"San Diego Comic-Con\nInternational\")\n\nIn May 2012, Feige said that the project was \"as close as it's ever been\"\nwhile Wright teased the film by tweeting a pictogram of Ant-Man.[77] In June,\nWright spent just under a week shooting footage for a reel that would be used\nto test out the potential look and tone of his movie, as well as to decide how\nconvincing Ant-Man's powers look on screen.[78] The test footage was screened\nto audiences during the Marvel Studios panel at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con\nInternational, with Wright confirming that _Ant-Man_ would be happening.[79]\nGermain Lussier of [/Film](/wiki//Film \"/Film\") felt the footage worked and\nwas \"awesome\", as \"it had a totally different vibe from the other Marvel\nfilms.

Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin\nsometime in 2014,[84] and that casting would begin towards the end of\n2013.[85] In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the\nscript for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so\nthat he could complete _[The World's End](/wiki/The_World%27s_End_\\(film\\)\n\"The World's End \\(film\\)\")_,[86] as that film's producer [Eric\nFellner](/wiki/Eric_Fellner \"Eric Fellner\") was diagnosed with cancer.[87]\n\nIn August 2013, after [Joss Whedon](/wiki/Joss_Whedon \"Joss Whedon\"), director\nof _[Avengers: Age of Ultron](/wiki/Avengers:_Age_of_Ultron \"Avengers: Age of\nUltron\")_ , announced that Hank Pym would not be [Ultron](/wiki/Ultron\n\"Ultron\")'s creator, Wright said Ultron was never a part of the story of _Ant-\nMan_ ,[88] explaining that \"just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough\nfor one movie\".[89] Wright described _Ant-Man_ as a [stand-alone](/wiki/Stand-\nalone_sequel \"Stand-alone sequel\") film but said it would fit into the larger\ncontinuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, \"I like to make it\nstandalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the\ncrazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think _Iron Man_ really\nworks because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely\nwant to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format\nto introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people\ninto it.\"[90] Wright also stated that pre-production for _Ant-Man_ would begin\nin October and filming would begin in 2014.[91] The next month, Disney moved\nthe film's release date up to July 31, 2015.[92]\n\n### Pre-production[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant-\nMan_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Pre-production\")]\n\nIn October 2013, Wright revealed that he was in Los Angeles to work on _Ant-\nMan_ by tweeting a photograph from the production of the June 2012 test\nreel.[93] [Joseph Gordon-Levitt](/wiki/Joseph_Gordon-Levitt \"Joseph Gordon-\nLevitt\") and [Paul Rudd](/wiki/Paul_Rudd \"Paul Rudd\") were soon being\nconsidered for the lead role,[94] though Gordon-Levitt dismissed his\nconsideration as a rumor.[95] Feige stated that _Ant-Man_ would be a \"[heist\nmovie](/wiki/Heist_film \"Heist film\")\", and that a casting announcement for\nHank Pym would come before the end of 2013.[96] The next month, Feige stated\nthat [Eric O'Grady](/wiki/Eric_O%27Grady \"Eric O'Grady\")'s Ant-Man would not\nbe featured in the film,[97] while Rudd became the front-runner to play Hank\nPym, and casting for the character's girlfriend had begun.[98] Around that\ntime, the filmmakers' intentions to shoot in the United Kingdom were dashed\nbecause of a lack of studio space, which Wright believed was due to the plan\nby [Pinewood Shepperton](/wiki/The_Pinewood_Studios_Group \"The Pinewood\nStudios Group\") to add fifteen studios to their facility, which was rejected\nin part by the local council in May 2013 because the project was eyeing\nprotected land.[99][100] By the end of the month, the film was scheduled to be\nshot in the U.S. instead.[101]\n\nIn December 2013, Wright, a fan of the comic book since childhood—owning\ncopies of _Tales to Astonish_ #27 featuring \"The Man in the Ant-Hill\"\nstoryline and _[Marvel Premiere](/wiki/Marvel_Premiere \"Marvel Premiere\")_ #47\nfeaturing the first appearance of Scott Lang—[102] stated that the difference\nbetween _Ant-Man_ and other films featuring size-changing is \"other shrinking\nmovies are usually about somebody trapped small. This is different in that he\ncan actually change size and he can do that at will, so it becomes more of a\npower than an impediment.\"[103] Wright also talked about the challenge of\ndirecting a superhero film, saying, \"_Shaun_ and _Hot Fuzz_ and _World 's End_\nare all R-rated films. I like the challenge of making a PG-13 film. Because\nyou've got to entertain in a different way. You don't have the same\ntools.\"[104] By December 19, Rudd was in negotiations to star in the\nfilm,[105][106] and Marvel announced that he had been cast as Ant-Man the next\nday.[107]\n\nIn January 2014, Wright posted a screenshot on his blog from the _[Avengers:\nEarth's Mightiest Heroes](/wiki/Avengers:_Earth%27s_Mightiest_Heroes\n\"Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes\")_ episode \"[To Steal an Ant-\nMan](/wiki/List_of_The_Avengers:_Earth%27s_Mightiest_Heroes_episodes#To_Steal_an_Ant-\nMan \"List of The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episodes\")\", which\nfeatures Hank Pym and introduces the Scott Lang character, with the caption\n\"homework\".[108][109] [Michael Douglas](/wiki/Michael_Douglas \"Michael\nDouglas\") was subsequently cast as Pym, with Rudd confirmed to play Lang.[7]\n[Michael Peña](/wiki/Michael_Pe%C3%B1a \"Michael Peña\") was offered an\nunspecified role in the film,[110] and filming was scheduled to take place at\n[Pinewood Atlanta](/wiki/Pinewood_Studios#Pinewood_Atlanta \"Pinewood Studios\")\nin [Fayette County, Georgia](/wiki/Fayette_County,_Georgia \"Fayette County,\nGeorgia\"),[111] while Disney changed the release date once again, moving the\nfilm up to July 17, 2015.[112] The next month, [Evangeline\nLilly](/wiki/Evangeline_Lilly \"Evangeline Lilly\") entered early talks to\nportray the female lead,[13] and Wright announced on his blog that [Bill\nPope](/wiki/Bill_Pope \"Bill Pope\"), who he worked with on _Scott Pilgrim vs.\nthe World_ and _The World 's End_, would be his [director of\nphotography](/wiki/Cinematographer \"Cinematographer\").[113] By March, Wright\nand Cornish turned in a fifth draft of the script, amid alleged disputes on\nthe direction the script was taking. As well, Wright and Cornish wrote a scene\nintended for the post-credits of _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ that would have\nacted as a prelude to the film.[114] [Corey Stoll](/wiki/Corey_Stoll \"Corey\nStoll\") entered negotiations for an undisclosed role in the film,[22] and by\nApril, [Patrick Wilson](/wiki/Patrick_Wilson_\\(American_actor\\) \"Patrick\nWilson \\(American actor\\)\") and [Matt Gerald](/wiki/Matt_Gerald \"Matt Gerald\")\nwere cast in undisclosed roles.[115][116]\n\n\"Ant-Man is interesting because he was one of the original\n[Avengers](/wiki/Avengers_\\(comics\\) \"Avengers \\(comics\\)\"), which I think\npeople forget about. So, I like that idea in the [movie\nuniverse](/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\")... I\nalso like that it's this sort of passing of the torch. There's sort of a weird\nmentor / pupil thing happening between Michael Douglas' character Hank Pym and\nScott Lang, which Paul Rudd plays. Hank Pym used to be old Ant-Man and he is\ntrying to find someone to be the new Ant-Man. I like that. I think that's sort\nof a classic Marvel Comics thing and something that we really haven't seen in\nthat universe.\"\n\n—[Peyton Reed](/wiki/Peyton_Reed \"Peyton Reed\"), director of _Ant-Man_[117]\n\nOn May 23, 2014, Marvel and Wright jointly announced that Wright was leaving\nthe project due to \"differences in their vision of the film\", and that the\nstudio was closing in on a new director.[118] On the split, Wright said, \"I\nwanted to make a Marvel movie but I don’t think they really wanted to make an\nEdgar Wright movie.\" He also added that at one point, Marvel wanted to do a\ndraft of the script without him, which was \"a tough thing to move forward\" as\nWright has written all of the previous films he directed. Wright continued,\n\"Suddenly becoming a director-for-hire on it, you’re sort of less emotionally\ninvested and you start to wonder why you’re there, really.\"[119] The majority\nof Wright's crew also left the project in the wake of his departure.[120][119]\nBy May 30, [Adam McKay](/wiki/Adam_McKay \"Adam McKay\") had entered\nnegotiations to replace Wright,[121] but pulled out of negotiations the next\nday.[122] On June 7, Marvel announced that [Peyton Reed](/wiki/Peyton_Reed\n\"Peyton Reed\") would direct the film, with McKay contributing to the film's\nscript.[5] Other directors that had been under consideration include [Ruben\nFleischer](/wiki/Ruben_Fleischer \"Ruben Fleischer\"), [Rawson Marshall\nThurber](/wiki/Rawson_Marshall_Thurber \"Rawson Marshall Thurber\"), [Nicholas\nStoller](/wiki/Nicholas_Stoller \"Nicholas Stoller\"), [Michael\nDowse](/wiki/Michael_Dowse \"Michael Dowse\"), and [David Wain](/wiki/David_Wain\n\"David Wain\").[123][124][125][126]\n\nLater in June, Feige stated the film was still intended to be released on the\nJuly 17, 2015 date, with production slated to begin on August 18,\n2014.[127][128] Feige elaborated that \"much of the movie will still be based\nvery much on [Wright and Cornish's] draft and the DNA of what Edgar has\ncreated up to this point\", with Reed stepping in to direct and McKay reworking\nonly parts of the script. \"[Reed] wanted to be sure that he wasn't just\ninheriting something or following someone else's lead. Or wasn't inheriting\nsomething that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad,\" Feige\ncontinued. \"He looked at everything, he talked with us, and he said 'Number\none, I agree with the direction you're going in. And number two, I can add to\nit.'\"[129]\n\nMcKay stated that Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd \"great with\ndialogue\", adding \"the two of us holed up in hotel rooms on the east and west\ncoast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and\ndid a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really\nthought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong\nscript from Edgar Wright and sort of just enhanced some stuff.\"[130] Rudd\nelaborated, \"The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all,\nis really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added\nnew sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you\ntook the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but\nthe idea is all theirs.\"[131] Reed also offered contributions to the revised\nscript, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their\nrespective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action\nsequences as a result.[17] One of the important things when joining the film\nfor Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp\nbeing \"a crucial part\" of the Ant-Man comics.[132] For their efforts, McKay\nand Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright\nand Cornish credited for the screenplay and story.[133] Wright also held an\nexecutive producer credit on the film.[134]\n\nBy the end of July, Wilson left the film because of scheduling conflicts\nbrought on by the filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and\n[Kevin Weisman](/wiki/Kevin_Weisman \"Kevin Weisman\") were cut in McKay's\nrevised script.[28] Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming\nwould take place in San Francisco.[135] The next month, Reed revealed that\n[Scott Lang's daughter](/wiki/Cassandra_Lang \"Cassandra Lang\") would appear in\nthe film,[136] and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make\nfurther revisions to the script.[137] [Eric Pearson](/wiki/Eric_Pearson \"Eric\nPearson\"), a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the\n[Marvel One-Shot](/wiki/Marvel_One-Shot \"Marvel One-Shot\") films, did\nuncredited work on the film as well,[138] scripting the strip club scene and\nStan Lee's cameo.[139] After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt\nthat the film was \"pulled\" more into the MCU than Wright's version which \"was\nmuch more in the Edgar Wright camp of films.\" She added that, while Wright's\nversion was \"incredible\" and would have been great to film and watch, \"it\nwouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore\nthumb, no matter how good it was. It just would have taken you away from this\ncohesive universe they're trying to create.

Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said,\n\"Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 was a good call, since at 2.35\nthere's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of\n[Ant-Man] going from standing full-size to falling through a crack in the\nfloor.\" Carpenter and [Technicolor](/wiki/Technicolor \"Technicolor\") also\ndevised a [lookup table](/wiki/Lookup_table \"Lookup table\") (LUT) to darken\nthe color palette. Carpenter said, \"For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my\nLUTs kind of '[Kodak](/wiki/Kodak \"Kodak\")' – saturated and upbeat. But this\nshow needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit,\nwhich dates back to the 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved\nabout this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it\nfrom fire-engine red to something a little more weathered.\"[149]\n\nThe filmmakers made extensive use of [macro\nphotography](/wiki/Macro_photography \"Macro photography\"). Production designer\nShepherd Frankel said, \"It's more visually interesting to depict things from\nAnt-Man's point of view instead of seeing him from a normal perspective. But\nwe wanted a realistic realization, not _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_ with its\noversized set pieces.\"[149] Rebecca Baehler served as the director of macro\nphotography, taking cues from Carpenter.[150] Carpenter said vibration became\n\"a tremendous problem\" when moving the camera during the macro photography\nbecause \"one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air. From an\nant's perspective, you move four inches, to a human perspective, that's a\nfootball field!\" The solution required the filmmakers to search for a creative\nsolution, so they turned to Baehler, who had a background in commercial\n\"tabletop\" photography. In order to add Rudd's performance as Ant-Man when in\nthe macro world, a Centroid facial capture set up was used, with a five-camera\narray of Alexas surrounding Rudd. Rosenfeld explained, \"One camera was set up\nvertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas, all\nset to record at 48 frames per second. This maximized resolution and provided\n3D modeling [of] Paul's performance.\" Reed would then call out story moments\nwith Rudd performing \"facial expressions that would later be composited on a\n[CG](/wiki/Computer_graphics \"Computer graphics\") Ant-Man.\"[149]\n\n### Post-production[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant-\nMan_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Post-production\")]\n\nFollowing the completion of principal photography, Marvel released an updated\nsynopsis revealing that [Jordi Mollà](/wiki/Jordi_Moll%C3%A0 \"Jordi Mollà\")\nwas included in the cast and the names of several supporting characters.[33]\nHowever, Mollà subsequently did not appear in the theatrical release of the\nfilm. Reed explained that the film's original opening, which was filmed and\ncut in the editing process, featured a standalone sequence similar to the\nopening of a [James Bond film](/wiki/James_Bond_in_film \"James Bond in film\"),\nwhere an unseen Pym was attempting to retrieve some microfilm from Mollà's\ncharacter, Castillo, a Panama army general. Reed stated the scene was going to\nshow Ant-Man's powers, without seeing him, almost \"like an Invisible Man\nsequence, and it's really, really cool. It started to feel tonally\ndisconnected from the movie we were making and story-wise, and it also kind of\nlike, it set a standalone adventure, but it didn’t just connect to the rest of\nour story...It felt like vestige of those earlier drafts [by Wright and\nCornish], which as a standalone thing was really cool.\"[151] Dan Lebental and\nColby Parker, Jr. served as [film editors](/wiki/Film_editing \"Film\nediting\").[34] In March 2015, [Hayley Atwell](/wiki/Hayley_Atwell \"Hayley\nAtwell\") confirmed that she would reprise her role as [Peggy\nCarter](/wiki/Peggy_Carter \"Peggy Carter\") in the film.[47] In April 2015,\nReed stated that the film was not completed yet and would be undergoing \"a\nlittle bit of additional\" filming.[152]\n\nIn June 2015, Feige confirmed that the character of Janet van Dyne would be\nseen, though the film would not address Pym and van Dyne's infamous domestic\nabuse storyline in the comics, saying, \"We hint at a temper in a way that\npeople who know the stories might go, 'Oh, perhaps that's a bit of [Hank's]\ncharacter,' but not in a way that would ever indicate [he beat his\nwife].\"[153] Also in the month, Reed confirmed there would be a post-credit\nsequence \"that may tie into the other films.\"[154] Feige revealed the post-\ncredit sequence was footage shot by [Anthony and Joe\nRusso](/wiki/Russo_brothers \"Russo brothers\") for _[Captain America: Civil\nWar](/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War \"Captain America: Civil War\")_ , saying\nthe clip would be seen in that film, though it may be \"different\ntakes...different angles.\"[155][156] On June 25, 2015, Reed announced on\nsocial media that production of _Ant-Man_ was officially complete.[157] In\nearly July 2015, an international teaser trailer revealed that [Anthony\nMackie](/wiki/Anthony_Mackie \"Anthony Mackie\") would appear in the film as\n[Sam Wilson / Falcon](/wiki/Falcon_\\(comics\\) \"Falcon \\(comics\\)\").[37] Mackie\nappears in the post-credit sequence as well, along with [Chris\nEvans](/wiki/Chris_Evans_\\(actor\\) \"Chris Evans \\(actor\\)\") and [Sebastian\nStan](/wiki/Sebastian_Stan \"Sebastian Stan\") as [Steve Rogers / Captain\nAmerica](/wiki/Captain_America \"Captain America\") and [Bucky Barnes / Winter\nSoldier](/wiki/Bucky_Barnes \"Bucky Barnes\"), respectively.[58] Stan stated the\nscene that was used for the post-credit sequence was shot in May 2015, and\nwould appear in the middle of _Civil War_.[158] Also in the month, Reed\nrevealed that the quantum realm in the film was the MCU's version of the\n[microverse](/wiki/Microverse \"Microverse\"),[38] which could not be called\nthat due to legal reasons. The alternate name was suggested by consultant\nSpiros Michalakis, a quantum physicist and staff researcher at the [California\nInstitute of Technology](/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology \"California\nInstitute of Technology\"), to \"inject elements of modern physics into the\nscript\".[159] Reed also said that the end of the film originally had a\nsequence where Ant-Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross'\nparticles, \"... But then for a couple reasons, it felt like maybe we should\nleave those particles out there.\"[160] For the title sequences, Marvel again\nwent with design firm Sarofsky, who had done the credits for both _Captain\nAmerica: The Winter Soldier_ and _[Guardians of the\nGalaxy](/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_\\(film\\) \"Guardians of the Galaxy\n\\(film\\)\")_ , with the credits \"intricately connected to the film's overall\nnarrative.\"[161]\n\n#### Visual effects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant-\nMan_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Visual effects\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e6/Corey_Stoll_as_Yellowjacket.jpg/220px-\nCorey_Stoll_as_Yellowjacket.jpg)](/wiki/File:Corey_Stoll_as_Yellowjacket.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Corey_Stoll_as_Yellowjacket.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFor Yellowjacket sequences, Stoll wore a [motion capture](/wiki/Motion_capture\n\"Motion capture\") suit while on set (top), which was replaced by an entirely\ndigital creation built by Double Negative (bottom).[150]\n\nVisual effects for the film were provided by [Industrial Light &\nMagic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic \"Industrial Light & Magic\") (ILM),\nLola VFX, [Double Negative](/wiki/Double_Negative_\\(VFX\\) \"Double Negative\n\\(VFX\\)\"), [Luma Pictures](/wiki/Luma_Pictures \"Luma Pictures\"), and [Method\nStudios](/wiki/Method_Studios \"Method Studios\"), with\n[previsualization](/wiki/Previsualization \"Previsualization\") by The Third\nFloor.[17][150][162] Double Negative handled the scenes featuring shrunken\ncharacters, incorporating the macro photography and [motion\ncapture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion capture\") performances shot in principal\nphotography with digital models of the characters. Double Negative also worked\non Ant-Man's shrinking effect, in coordination with ILM to be used by all\nvendors, which showed the outline of his body – an element from the comics.\nVisual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, \"It's like a little time echo. As\nAnt-Man shrinks in almost a stop motion way he would leave behind outlines of\nthe poses he'd been in as he shrinks down... We'd have two CG cameras\nrendering the action from different points along the timeline with slightly\ndifferent framings. One would be the main shot camera, the other would be a\nutility camera that would provide renders of static poses of Ant-Man at\ndifferent points along the timeline.\"[150]\n\nFor the flashbacks in 1989, Douglas and Donovan appeared [de-aged](/wiki/De-\naging_in_film \"De-aging in film\") via CGI, alongside Atwell as Carter (aged in\nmakeup and with CGI) and [John Slattery](/wiki/John_Slattery \"John Slattery\")\nas [Howard Stark](/wiki/Howard_Stark \"Howard Stark\").[4][50][150][153] To de-\nage Douglas, Lola VFX used a similar process and technology that was used to\nmake Steve Rogers skinny in _[Captain America: The First\nAvenger](/wiki/Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger \"Captain America: The First\nAvenger\")_ and Carter older in _[Captain America: The Winter\nSoldier](/wiki/Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier \"Captain America: The\nWinter Soldier\")_ as well as footage of Douglas' other films from the late\n1980s as reference.[40][162] [Dax Griffin](/wiki/Dax_Griffin \"Dax Griffin\")\nserved as Douglas' [body double](/wiki/Body_double \"Body double\") and an\nadditional reference for Lola, because of his \"striking resemblance of Michael\nwhen he was about 40\".[162][163] For Donovan, he only needed to be de-aged\nabout a decade, so no double was used. The work on him focused on his eyes,\nneck, and chin. Atwell wore a wig on set, along with a fine layer of latex\nmakeup to give the skin a more leathery look, with Lola transposing the facial\nfeatures of an elderly actress onto her face.[150]\n\nMethod and Luma both worked on creating the various ants seen in the film,\nwith Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors.\nLuma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts\nto acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having\ndone Falcon visual effects in _The Winter Soldier_. Using practical suit\npieces built by [Legacy Effects](/wiki/Legacy_Effects \"Legacy Effects\"), ILM\nmixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to\ncreate the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm,\nproviding an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the\nsubatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering\ntechniques the studio had utilized on _[Lucy](/wiki/Lucy_\\(2014_film\\) \"Lucy\n\\(2014 film\\)\")_.[150]\n\n## Music[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant-Man_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\nMain article: [Ant-Man (soundtrack)](/wiki/Ant-Man_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Ant-Man\n\\(soundtrack\\)\")\n\nIn February 2014, Wright tweeted that [Steven\nPrice](/wiki/Steven_Price_\\(composer\\) \"Steven Price \\(composer\\)\") would\n[score](/wiki/Film_score \"Film score\") the film.[113] However, Price left soon\nafter Wright's departure from the project in May 2014.[120] In January 2015,\n[Christophe Beck](/wiki/Christophe_Beck \"Christophe Beck\"), who worked with\nReed on _[Bring It On](/wiki/Bring_It_On_\\(film\\) \"Bring It On \\(film\\)\")_ ,\nwas hired to replace Price.[164] Describing the film's score, Beck said, \"For\n_Ant-Man_ , I wanted to write a score in the grand symphonic tradition of my\nfavorite superhero movies, with a sweeping scope and a big, catchy main theme.\nWhat makes this score stand out among other Marvel movies, though, is a sneaky\nsense of fun since it is, after all, not only a superhero movie, but also a\nheist comedy.\"[165] [Hollywood Records](/wiki/Hollywood_Records \"Hollywood\nRecords\") released the soundtrack digitally on July 17, 2015, and had a\nphysical release on August 7.[166]\n\n## Release[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant-Man_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Release\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Paul_Rudd_%28cropped%29_2.jpg/170px-\nPaul_Rudd_%28cropped%29_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Paul_Rudd_\\(cropped\\)_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Paul_Rudd_\\(cropped\\)_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRudd at the world premiere of _Ant-Man_ in Hollywood\n\n_Ant-Man_ premiered at the [Dolby Theatre](/wiki/Dolby_Theatre \"Dolby\nTheatre\") in Hollywood on June 29, 2015,[167] and opened the 2015 [Fantasia\nInternational Film Festival](/wiki/Fantasia_International_Film_Festival\n\"Fantasia International Film Festival\") on July 14, 2015, along with _[Miss\nHokusai](/wiki/Miss_Hokusai \"Miss Hokusai\")_.[168] The film was released in\nFrance on July 14,[169] and was released in North America on July 17,[112] in\n[3D](/wiki/3D_film \"3D film\") and [IMAX 3D](/wiki/IMAX_3D \"IMAX\n3D\").[170][171] The film was released in the United States in 3,800 theaters,\nwith the breakdown of 3,100 3D screens, 361 IMAX screens, 388 [large\nformat](/wiki/Large_format_\\(photography\\) \"Large format \\(photography\\)\")\nscreens and 133 [D-Box](/wiki/D-Box_Technologies \"D-Box Technologies\")\nscreens.[169] _Ant-Man_ had originally been scheduled for release on November\n6, 2015.[82] In September 2013, the release was moved to July 31, 2015,[92]\nbefore changing for a final time to July 17, 2015 in January 2014.[112] An\nunfinished version of the film was screened on June 24, 2015, at\n[CineEurope](/wiki/CineEurope \"CineEurope\").[172]\n\n### Marketing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ant-\nMan_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Marketing\")]\n\nIn March 2014, [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American\nBroadcasting Company\") aired a one-hour [television\nspecial](/wiki/Television_special \"Television special\"), _Marvel Studios:\nAssembling a Universe_ , which included a sneak peek of _Ant-Man_.[173][174]\nIn July 2014, Reed, Rudd, Douglas, Lilly, and Stoll appeared at Marvel\nStudios' panel at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International to help promote\nthe film and screen a visual effects test featuring Rudd and Douglas.[21] In\nOctober 2014, Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief [Axel Alonso](/wiki/Axel_Alonso\n\"Axel Alonso\") stated there are comic tie-in plans for the film.[175] In\nNovember 2014, ABC aired another one-hour television special titled, _[Marvel\n75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!](/wiki/Marvel_75_Years:_From_Pulp_to_Pop! \"Marvel\n75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!\")_ , which featured behind the scenes footage of\n_Ant-Man_.[176] Marvel Comics' February 2015 solicitations released in\nDecember 2014, revealed a two-issue comic tie-in, _Marvel 's Ant-Man Prelude_,\nfollowing Hank Pym as Ant-Man on a mission during the Cold War.[177] A second\ncomic tie-in, _Marvel 's Ant-Man—Scott Lang: Small Time_, was released\ndigitally on March 3, 2015.

Scott\nMendelson of _[Forbes](/wiki/Forbes \"Forbes\")_ , said, \"It was darn-clever for\nDisney to put out a miniature 'can't see anything without a microscope'\nversion of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little\nwhen they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney\nhad just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But\nnonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single\ntheatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days.\"\nMendelson went on to say that \"the peppy, witty trailer above is a general\naudience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but\nit's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good.\"[179]\nHowever, Graeme McMillan of _[The Hollywood\nReporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_ criticized\nthe trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of _Agent Carter_\n, its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other\ntrailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, \"The _Ant-Man_ trailer isn't\nbad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which almost seems\nworse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright\nand the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, _Ant-Man_ has become the\nmovie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if\nnot financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets\nby on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much as anything\nelse, doesn't do enough — or anything, really — to persuade audiences that\nthat's not the case.\"[180] The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in\nthree days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind\ntrailers for _[Iron Man 3](/wiki/Iron_Man_3 \"Iron Man 3\")_ and _Avengers: Age\nof Ultron_.[181]\n\nIn April 2015, Marvel debuted a second trailer for _Ant-Man_. Mendelson said\nit was \"frankly the _Ant-Man_ trailer that we've been waiting for.
