It was launched in 1995, and was originally\nbrewed in [Golden, Colorado](/wiki/Golden,_Colorado \"Golden, Colorado\").\n\nOriginally called Bellyslide Belgian White, the beer was created by Keith\nVilla, a [brewer](/wiki/Brewer \"Brewer\") at the Sandlot Brewery at [Coors\nField](/wiki/Coors_Field \"Coors Field\"), [Denver](/wiki/Denver \"Denver\"),\nColorado (owned by the [Molson Coors Brewing\nCompany](/wiki/Molson_Coors_Brewing_Company \"Molson Coors Brewing Company\")).\nBlue Moon brewed at the [Molson Brewery](/wiki/Molson_Brewery \"Molson\nBrewery\") in [Montreal](/wiki/Montreal \"Montreal\"), Quebec, Canada is sold in\nthe USA, as well as exported to [Europe](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\").[2] It's sold\nunder the name Belgian Moon in Canada. Blue Moon Brewing Co. is an entity of\nTenth and Blake Beer Company, the craft and import division of\n[MillerCoors](/wiki/MillerCoors \"MillerCoors\").\n\nThe grain bill for Blue Moon includes [malted barley](/wiki/Malted_barley\n\"Malted barley\"), white [wheat](/wiki/Wheat \"Wheat\"),\n[orange](/wiki/Orange_\\(fruit\\) \"Orange \\(fruit\\)\")\n[peel](/wiki/Peel_\\(fruit\\) \"Peel \\(fruit\\)\"), [coriander](/wiki/Coriander\n\"Coriander\") and [oats](/wiki/Oats \"Oats\")—and is usually served with a slice\nof orange, which its [brewmasters](/wiki/Brewmaster \"Brewmaster\") claim\naccentuates the flavor of the brew.[3]\n\nAvailable in cans, bottles and [kegs](/wiki/Keg \"Keg\"), Blue Moon has 5.4%\n[alcohol by volume](/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume \"Alcohol by volume\").[4] In\n[Oklahoma](/wiki/Oklahoma \"Oklahoma\"), [Minnesota](/wiki/Minnesota\n\"Minnesota\"), [Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\") and [Utah](/wiki/Utah\n\"Utah\"), the alcohol content of all Blue Moon beers bought in grocery or\nconvenience stores is 3.2% alcohol by weight (approximately 4.0% alcohol by\nvolume).

The Brewers Association\nsays that this omission allows the Blue Moon Brewing Company to masquerade as\nan independent craft brewer.[5] Independent craft brewers, such as Greg Koch,\nCEO of [Stone Brewing Co.](/wiki/Stone_Brewing_Co. \"Stone Brewing Co.\"), agree\nthat the multinational conglomerate brewers' use of bottle imagery similar to\nindependent craft beers misleads consumers.[6] In May 2015, a California man\nfiled suit against MillerCoors for the \"Craft Beer\" labeling.[7]\n\n## Naming\ncontroversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blue_Moon_\\(beer\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Naming controversy\")]\n\nIn 1999, the Confederation des Brasseries de Belgique (The Confederation of\nBelgian Breweries) sued the then-named Coors Brewing Company over its use of\nthe term \"Belgian White\". The CBB alleged Coors' advertising was misleading,\nand could confuse American consumers into believing Blue Moon was made in\n[Belgium](/wiki/Belgium \"Belgium\"). Coors at first responded by adding \"Made\nin USA\" and \"Belgian-style\" in small print to the bottle labels, but refused\nto change its advertising or packaging.[8]\n\nCoors eventually settled out of court with the CBB, agreeing to change the\nlabeling to \"Belgian-style Wheat Ale\". Additionally, the CBB distributes the\nbeer to conglomerates in European countries.[9]\n\nThe [New Belgium Brewery](/wiki/New_Belgium_Brewery \"New Belgium Brewery\"),\nwhich makes Fat Tire Amber Ale, also complied with the CBB's request for name\nchanges.[10]\n\n## Variations of Blue\nMoon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blue_Moon_\\(beer\\)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Variations of Blue Moon\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Blue_Moon_Beer.jpg/170px-\nBlue_Moon_Beer.jpg)](/wiki/File:Blue_Moon_Beer.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Blue_Moon_Beer.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBlue Moon Agave Nectar Ale and Blue Moon.\n\nIn addition to their original Belgian White variety, Blue Moon Brewing Company\noffers Blue Moon Summer Ale, renamed **Honey Moon** in 2006. Honey Moon\ncontains 5.2% alcohol by volume in a standard 12 fluid ounce bottle. The beer\nwas renamed \"Summer Honey Wheat\" in 2011, and is still sold under that name.\n\nIn autumn, Blue Moon provides Blue Moon Pumpkin Ale, renamed **Harvest Moon**\nin 2007. This variety contains the flavors of pumpkins and other autumnal\nspices. Harvest Moon is typically available in bottles from mid-September\nthrough December. It contains 5.7% alcohol by volume in a standard 12 fluid\nounce bottle. The beer was renamed \"Harvest Pumpkin Ale\" and is still marketed\nunder that name.\n\nBlue Moon offers Blue Moon Winter Abbey Ale during the winter season. Its name\nwas changed to **Full Moon** with the subtitle \"Blue Moon Winter Ale\" in 2007.\nIt is brewed with natural flavor and a caramel color. Full Moon contains 5.6%\nalcohol in a standard 12 fluid ounce bottle. The name was changed to \"Mountain\nAbbey Ale\" in 2012.\n\nIn spring, Blue Moon provides Blue Moon Spring Blonde Ale, originally known as\n**Rising Moon**. In 2011 the recipe was changed removing the Kaffir lime\nleaves. The new recipe focuses more on orange and lemon peel to add the citrus\nflavors. In 2013 the beer was changed to \"Valencia Grove Amber\", an amber ale\nbrewed with Valencia orange peel, roasted malts and a touch of wheat.\n\nIt addition to its seasonal brews, Blue Moon released a [pale\nale](/wiki/Pale_ale \"Pale ale\") called **Pale Moon** in 2008, with filings\ncommenced to create a **Pale Moon Light**. Pale Moon is now marketed as\n\"Rounder\".\n\nBlue Moon released a revamped and renamed set of seasonal beers starting with\nthe **Winter Abbey Ale** , in 2010.[11]\n\n### Blue Moon\nbrews[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blue_Moon_\\(beer\\)&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Blue Moon brews\")]\n\n  * **Blue Moon** (1995) _(originally Bellyslide Belgian White)_\n  * **Raspberry Cream Ale** (1995) _(Special release)_\n  * **Nut Brown Ale** (1995) _(Released with Raspberry Cream Ale)_\n  * **Blue Moon Pale Ale** (2008) _(originally Pale Moon)_\n  * **Blue Moon Grand Cru** (2010) Strong Belgian white ale, originally released to commemorate Blue Moon on New Year's Day 2010 - _(Retired)_\n  * **Mountain Abbey Ale** _(2010) (formerly Full Moon (2006) and Winter Abbey Ale (2012), originally Blue Moon Winter Ale)_\n  * **Spring Blonde Wheat Ale** (2011) _(formerly Rising Moon (2007), originally Blue Moon Spring Ale)_ \\- **Valencia Grove Amber** (2013) is the current[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_] Spring Seasonal Collection\n  * **Summer Honey Wheat Ale** (2011) _(formerly Honey Moon (2006), originally Blue Moon Summer Ale)_\n  * **Harvest Pumpkin Ale** (2011) _(formerly Harvest Moon (2006), originally Blue Moon Pumpkin Ale)_\n  * **Spiced Amber Ale** (2011) _(Retired)_\n  * **Farmhouse Red Ale** (2012)\n  * **Valencia Amber Ale** (2012) (included in the Spring 2012 Brewmaster's Sampler)\n  * **Agave Nectar Ale** (2012) (included in the Summer 2012 Brewmaster's Sampler)\n  * **Caramel Apple Spiced Ale** (2012) (included in the Fall 2012 Brewmaster's Sampler) - Commemorating Lunar Blue Moon August 31, 2012 & September 1, 2012\n  * **Sunshine Citrus Blonde** (2013) (included in the Spring 2013 Brewmaster's Sampler)\n  * **Blackberry Tart Ale** (2013)\n  * **Peanut Butter Ale** (2013) _(Special release)_\n  * **Rounder Belgian-Style Pale** (2013) _(Part of the Expressionist Collection)_\n  * **Gingerbread Spiced Ale** (2013) _(included in the Winter 2013 Brewmaster 's Sampler)_\n  * **Cinnamon Horchata Ale** (2014)\n  * **Chai Spiced Ale** (2015) _(included in the Fall 2015 Brewmaster 's Sampler)_\n  * **Cappuccino Oatmeal Stout** (2015) _(included in the Winter 2015 Brewmaster 's Sampler)_\n  * **White IPA** (2015)\n  * **Belgian Table Pils** (2016)\n  * **Cocoa Brown Ale** (2016) _(included in the Winter 2016 Brewmaster 's Sampler)_\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blue_Moon_\\(beer\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Projet_bi%C3%A8re_logo_v2.png/28px-Projet_bi%C3%A8re_logo_v2.png)](/wiki/File:Projet_bi%C3%A8re_logo_v2.png)[Beer portal](/wiki/Portal:Beer \"Portal:Beer\")\n\n  * [Shock Top](/wiki/Shock_Top \"Shock Top\"), a similar beer produced by [Anheuser-Busch](/wiki/Anheuser-Busch \"Anheuser-Busch\").\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blue_Moon_\\(beer\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Coors.com Nutrition Information](http://www.coors.com/brews_nutrition.asp) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20150314224935/http://www.coors.com/brews_nutrition.asp) 2015-03-14 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine \"Wayback Machine\").\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Molson to brew Blue Moon beer in Montreal\"](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2005/05/05/molson-050505.html). _CBC News_.
