        "# Tax-Free Savings Account\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n\"TFSA\" redirects here. For other uses, see [TFSA\n(disambiguation)](/wiki/TFSA_\\(disambiguation\\) \"TFSA \\(disambiguation\\)\").\n\nThe **Tax-Free Savings Account** (**TFSA** , [French](/wiki/French_language\n\"French language\"): _Compte d 'épargne libre d'impôt_ or _CÉLI_) is an account\navailable in Canada and South Africa that provides [tax](/wiki/Tax \"Tax\")\nbenefits for saving. Investment income, including [capital\ngains](/wiki/Capital_gain \"Capital gain\") and [dividends](/wiki/Dividend\n\"Dividend\"), earned in a TFSA is not taxed in most cases, even when withdrawn.\nContributions to a TFSA are not deductible for income tax purposes, unlike\ncontributions to a [Registered Retirement Savings\nPlan](/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan \"Registered Retirement Savings\nPlan\") (RRSP).\n\nDespite the name, a TFSA does not have to be a cash [savings\naccount](/wiki/Savings_account \"Savings account\"). Like an RRSP, a TFSA may\ncontain cash and/or other investments such as [mutual funds](/wiki/Mutual_fund\n\"Mutual fund\"), certain [stocks](/wiki/Stock \"Stock\"),\n[bonds](/wiki/Bond_\\(finance\\) \"Bond \\(finance\\)\"), or [Guaranteed Investment\nCertificates](/wiki/Guaranteed_Investment_Certificate \"Guaranteed Investment\nCertificate\") (GICs).[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Canadian features\n    * 2.1 Contribution room\n    * 2.2 Eligible investments\n    * 2.3 Creditor protection\n    * 2.4 Over-contributions\n    * 2.5 Foreign dividend withholding tax\n    * 2.6 Risks for U.S. citizens and U.S residents\n  * 3 South African features\n  * 4 Comparison to RRSP\n  * 5 Similar accounts in other countries\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe first Tax-Free Savings Account was introduced by [Jim\nFlaherty](/wiki/Jim_Flaherty \"Jim Flaherty\"), then [Canadian](/wiki/Canada\n\"Canada\") federal [Minister of Finance](/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_\\(Canada\\)\n\"Minister of Finance \\(Canada\\)\"), in the [2008 federal\nbudget](/wiki/2008_Canadian_federal_budget \"2008 Canadian federal budget\"). It\ncame into effect on January 1, 2009.[2]\n\nThis measure was supported by the [C.D. Howe\nInstitute](/wiki/C.D._Howe_Institute \"C.D. Howe Institute\"), which stated;\n“This tax policy gem is very good news for Canadians, and Mr. Flaherty and his\ngovernment deserve credit for a novel program”.[3] Furthermore, the [Canadian\nFederation of Independent\nBusiness](/wiki/Canadian_Federation_of_Independent_Business \"Canadian\nFederation of Independent Business\"),[4] [Canadian Bankers\nAssociation](/wiki/Canadian_Bankers_Association \"Canadian Bankers\nAssociation\"),[5] [Bank of Montreal](/wiki/Bank_of_Montreal \"Bank of\nMontreal\") economist Doug Porter,[4] the [Canadian Chamber of\nCommerce](/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Chamber_of_Commerce&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Canadian Chamber of Commerce \\(page does not exist\\)\"),[6] and the [Canadian\nTaxpayers Federation](/wiki/Canadian_Taxpayers_Federation \"Canadian Taxpayers\nFederation\")[7] also supported this tax policy. In 2015 South Africa\nintroduced TFSA accounts to encourage low to middle-class citizens to save\nmoney.\n\n## Canadian features[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Canadian features\")]\n\nThe TFSA is an account in which Canadian residents 18 years and older can save\nor invest. Income earned on contributions is not taxed. The TFSA account-\nholder may withdraw money from the account at any time, free of taxes.\n\n### Contribution room[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Contribution room\")]\n\nThe maximum annual contribution room for each year prior to 2013 was $5,000\nper year. Beginning in 2013 it was increased to $5,500 per year.[8] The $5,500\nannual contribution limit was indexed to the [Consumer Price\nIndex](/wiki/Consumer_Price_Index \"Consumer Price Index\") (CPI), in $500\nincrements, in order to account for [inflation](/wiki/Inflation\n\"Inflation\").[9]\n\nThe [2015 federal budget](/wiki/2015_Canadian_federal_budget \"2015 Canadian\nfederal budget\") raised the contribution limit to $10,000, and eliminated\nindexation for inflation, beginning with the 2015 tax year.[10] However, in\nDecember 2015 a newly elected government proposed to restore the pre-2015\ncontribution limit of $5,500 for 2016, which will be indexed for inflation\nafter that.[11][12][13]\n\nAs of January 1, 2018, the total cumulative contribution room for a TFSA is\n$57,500 for those who have been 18 years or older and residents of Canada for\nall eligible years.\n\nYears | TFSA Annual Limit | Cumulative Total  \n---|---|---  \n2009–2012 | $5,000 | $20,000  \n2013–2014 | $5,500 | $31,000  \n2015 | $10,000[14] | $41,000  \n2016–2018 | $5,500 | $57,500  \n  \nAny unused contribution room under the cap can be carried forward to\nsubsequent years, without any upward limit.[15]\n\n### Eligible investments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Eligible\ninvestments\")]\n\nA TFSA can hold any investments that are RRSP-eligible, including publicly\ntraded shares on eligible exchanges, eligible shares of private corporations,\ncertain debt obligations, instalment receipts, money denominated in any\ncurrency, trust interests including mutual funds and real estate investment\ntrusts, annuity contracts, warrants, rights and options, registered\ninvestments, royalty units, partnership units, and depository receipts.[16]\n\n### Creditor protection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Creditor\nprotection\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and [removed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\"). _(September 2017)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this template message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal \"Help:Maintenance template removal\"))_  \n---|---  \n  \nAssets within a TFSA are not protected from creditors in the event of\nbankruptcy or a financial judgement that results from legal proceedings\nagainst the account-holder, whereas those within an RRSP are protected. Unless\nthe investments in the TFSA are in a segregated fund (which then follows the\nInsurance act rules).\n\n### Over-contributions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Over-\ncontributions\")]\n\nA withdrawal in any year _will_ increase the available contribution room, but\nnot in that current calendar year – it can only be re-contributed starting on\nJanuary 1 of the following year. An over-contribution will occur if an\nindividual (whose TFSA contributions have already been maximized for the year)\nmistakenly believes that a withdrawal immediately creates contribution room\nand re-contributes the withdrawn funds later the same calendar year.\n\nIn the 2012 [tax year](/wiki/Tax_year \"Tax year\"), the CRA sent notices to\nabout 74,000 taxpayers about TFSA over-contributions, out of about nine\nmillion TFSAs existing at the end of 2012. About 76,000 notices were sent in\n2011 and 103,000 in 2010.[17]\n\n### Foreign dividend withholding tax[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Foreign dividend\nwithholding tax\")]\n\nUnlike an RRSP, a TFSA is not considered by the United States [Internal\nRevenue Service](/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service \"Internal Revenue Service\") to\nbe a pension plan. Therefore, the [tax treaty](/wiki/Tax_treaty \"Tax treaty\")\nbetween the U.S. and Canada foregoing the U.S. [withholding\ntax](/wiki/Withholding_tax \"Withholding tax\") on dividends in registered\npension plans does not apply to TFSA accounts, subjecting Canadians in most\ncases to a 15% U.S. tax withheld on dividends paid on shares of U.S.\ncorporations. The tax withheld cannot be credited against other payable taxes\nas would be the case with non-registered accounts.\n\nTo get around this problem, one [exchange-traded fund](/wiki/Exchange-\ntraded_fund \"Exchange-traded fund\") manager, Horizons ETFs Group, offers an\nETF that uses [swap contracts](/wiki/Swap_\\(finance\\) \"Swap \\(finance\\)\") to\nreplicate the return of the underlying dividend-paying stocks in the fund\nwithout actually holding any of those stocks. However, due to the fees charged\nby the [counterparty](/wiki/Counterparty \"Counterparty\") to the swap\nagreement, as well as the fund's own management fee, its expenses exceed the\nactual withholding tax payable for the underlying stocks, if those were to be\nheld directly in the TFSA.[18][19][20][21][22][23]\n\n### Risks for U.S. citizens and U.S residents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Risks for U.S.\ncitizens and U.S residents\")]\n\nCanadian mutual funds held in TFSAs are generally considered by the IRS to be\ninvestments in a [passive foreign investment\ncompany](/wiki/Passive_foreign_investment_company \"Passive foreign investment\ncompany\") (PFIC), and must be reported as such (on form 8621) by U.S.\ncitizens. PFICs can be very disadvantageous as, absent certain elections,\n\"excess\" distributions are always taxed at the highest marginal rate. Also,\nincome is averaged over the duration of the investment, and interest is then\ncharged from the date the income is deemed to have occurred, resulting in\neffective tax rates as high as 50% or more.[24][25] The TFSA may also be a\ngrantor foreign trust from the perspective of the U.S. U.S. citizens with a\ngrantor foreign trust are required to file IRS Forms 3520A (due March 15) and\n3520 (due at the same time as Form 1040). These forms are both complicated and\nboth involve potentially large penalties for late filing. Like other non-U.S.\naccounts the TFSA may also need to be included on a U.S. citizen's FBAR and\ntax-FBAR. Earnings inside the TFSA are taxed by the U.S.\n\n## South African features[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: South African\nfeatures\")]\n\nThe lifetime contribution limit is R500000 and the annual limit is R33000.[26]\n\n## Comparison to RRSP[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Comparison to\nRRSP\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and [removed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\"). _(April 2018)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this template message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal \"Help:Maintenance template removal\"))_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe tax treatment of a TFSA is the opposite of a [Registered Retirement\nSavings Plan](/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan \"Registered Retirement\nSavings Plan\") (RRSP). There is an income tax deduction for contributions to\nan RRSP, and withdrawals of contributions and investment income are all\ntaxable. In contrast, there is no tax deduction for contributions to a TFSA,\nand there is no tax on withdrawals of investment income or contributions from\nthe account.\n\nUnlike an RRSP, which must be withdrawn before the holder turns 71, the TFSA\ndoes not expire.\n\nIf an account-holder withdraws funds from a TFSA, his or her contribution room\nis increased by that amount on the 1st of January after the withdrawal. In an\nRRSP, the contribution room is not increased to reflect withdrawals.\n\nThe [Canada Revenue Agency](/wiki/Canada_Revenue_Agency \"Canada Revenue\nAgency\") (CRA) describes the difference between a TFSA and an RRSP as follows:\n\"An RRSP is primarily intended for retirement. The TFSA is like an RRSP for\neverything else in your life.\" Interest paid on money borrowed to invest in\neither TFSA or RRSP is not tax deductible.[27]\n\n## Similar accounts in other countries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Similar accounts in\nother countries\")]\n\nThe TFSA is similar to a [Roth Individual Retirement\nArrangement](/wiki/Roth_IRA \"Roth IRA\") in United States, although the TFSA\nhas fewer restrictions.[_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\n\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_][28] In the UK, similar tax advantages have been\navailable in [Individual Savings Accounts](/wiki/Individual_Savings_Account\n\"Individual Savings Account\") since 1999.[29]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Taxation in Canada](/wiki/Taxation_in_Canada \"Taxation in Canada\")\n  * [Registered Retirement Savings Plan](/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan \"Registered Retirement Savings Plan\")\n  * [Registered Education Savings Plan](/wiki/Registered_Education_Savings_Plan \"Registered Education Savings Plan\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tax-\nFree_Savings_Account&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Canada Revenue Agency](/wiki/Canada_Revenue_Agency \"Canada Revenue Agency\") (2014-02-14).
