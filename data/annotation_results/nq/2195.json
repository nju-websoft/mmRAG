        "# Greater-than sign\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nFor the use of the \">\" sign as punctuation, see [Bracket § Angle\nbrackets](/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets \"Bracket\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Greater_than_sign.png)](/wiki/File:Greater_than_sign.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Greater_than_sign.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nGreater-than sign\n\nThe **greater-than sign** is a mathematical symbol that denotes an\n[inequality](/wiki/Inequality_\\(mathematics\\) \"Inequality \\(mathematics\\)\")\nbetween two values. The widely adopted form of two equal-length strokes\nconnecting in an [acute angle](/wiki/Acute_angle \"Acute angle\") at the right,\n**>** , has been found in documents dated as far back as the 1560s. In typical\nmathematical usage, the greater-than sign is typically placed between the two\nvalues being compared and signals that the first number is greater than the\nsecond number. Examples of typical usage include _1½ > 1_ and _1 > −2_. Since\nthe development of computer [programming languages](/wiki/Programming_language\n\"Programming language\"), the greater-than sign and the [less-than\nsign](/wiki/Less-than_sign \"Less-than sign\") have been repurposed for a range\nof uses and operations.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Computing\n    * 2.1 Angle brackets\n    * 2.2 Programming language\n    * 2.3 Double greater-than sign\n    * 2.4 Triple greater-than sign\n    * 2.5 Greater-than sign with equals sign\n    * 2.6 Hyphen-minus with greater-than sign\n    * 2.7 Shell scripts\n    * 2.8 Spaceship operator\n    * 2.9 HTML\n    * 2.10 E-mail and the Internet\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-than_sign&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe symbols < and > first appear in _Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes\nAlgebraicas Resolvendas_ (_The Analytical Arts Applied to Solving Algebraic\nEquations_) by [Thomas Harriot](/wiki/Thomas_Harriot \"Thomas Harriot\")\n(1560–1621), which was published posthumously in 1631. The text states:\n\"_Signum majoritatis ut_ a > b _significet_ a _majorem quam_ b\" and \"_Signum\nminoritatis ut_ a < b _significet_ a _minorem quam_ b.\"\n\nAccording to historian Art Johnson (page 144), while Harriot was surveying\nNorth America, he saw a [Native\nAmerican](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native Americans in the\nUnited States\") with a symbol that resembled the greater-than sign both\nbackwards and forwards ( > and < ).[1] Johnson says it is likely he developed\nthe two symbols from this symbol.[1]\n\n## Computing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-than_sign&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Computing\")]\n\nThe **greater-than sign** (`>`) is an original [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII \"ASCII\")\ncharacter (hex 3E, decimal 62).\n\nThe [character](/wiki/Character_\\(computing\\) \"Character \\(computing\\)\") in\n[Unicode](/wiki/Unicode \"Unicode\") is U+003E > GREATER-THAN SIGN (HTML `&#62;`\n**·** `&gt;`); this is inherited from the same value in [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII\n\"ASCII\").\n\nApart from this, Unicode also has the following variants:\n\n  * U+232A 〉 RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET (HTML `&#9002;` **·** `&rang;`)\n\n### Angle brackets[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-\nthan_sign&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Angle brackets\")]\n\nThe greater-than sign is used for an approximation of the closing [angle\nbracket](/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets \"Bracket\") (⟩). ASCII does not have\nangular brackets.\n\n### Programming language[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-\nthan_sign&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Programming language\")]\n\n[BASIC](/wiki/BASIC \"BASIC\") and [C](/wiki/C_\\(programming_language\\) \"C\n\\(programming language\\)\")-family languages, (including\n[Java](/wiki/Java_\\(programming_language\\) \"Java \\(programming language\\)\")\nand [C++](/wiki/C%2B%2B \"C++\")) use the operator `>` to mean \"greater than\".\nIn [Lisp](/wiki/Lisp_\\(programming_language\\) \"Lisp \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\")-family languages, `>` is a function used to mean \"greater than\".\nIn [Coldfusion](/wiki/Coldfusion \"Coldfusion\") and [Fortran](/wiki/Fortran\n\"Fortran\"), operator `.GT.` means \"greater than\".\n\n### Double greater-than sign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-\nthan_sign&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Double greater-than sign\")]\n\nThe double greater-than sign (`>>`) is used for an approximation of the much\ngreater than sign (≫). ASCII does not have the much greater-than sign.\n\nThe double greater-than sign (`>>`) is also used for an approximation of the\nclosing [guillemet](/wiki/Guillemets \"Guillemets\") (»).\n\nIn [Java](/wiki/Java_\\(programming_language\\) \"Java \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\"), [C](/wiki/C_\\(programming_language\\) \"C \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\"), and [C++](/wiki/C%2B%2B \"C++\"), the operator `>>` is the [right-\nshift operator](/wiki/Right-shift_operator \"Right-shift operator\"). In C++ it\nis also used to get input from a [stream](/wiki/Stream_\\(computing\\) \"Stream\n\\(computing\\)\"), similar to the C functions `getchar` and `fgets`.\n\nIn [Haskell](/wiki/Haskell_\\(programming_language\\) \"Haskell \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\"), the `>>` function is a monadic operator. It is used for\nsequentially composing two actions, discarding any value produced by the\nfirst. In that regard, it is like the statement sequencing operator in\nimperative languages, such as the semicolon in C.\n\n### Triple greater-than sign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-\nthan_sign&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Triple greater-than sign\")]\n\nThe triple greater-than sign (>>>) is the unsigned right shift operator in\n[JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript \"JavaScript\"), and is the default\n[Python](/wiki/Python_\\(programming_language\\) \"Python \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\") prompt of the interactive shell, often seen for code examples\nwhich can be executed interactively in the interpreter\n\n    \n    \n    ~:$ python\n    Python 2.7.5 (default, Mar  9 2014, 22:15:05) \n    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)] on darwin\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n    >>> print(\"Hello World\")\n    Hello World\n    >>>\n    \n\n### Greater-than sign with equals sign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-\nthan_sign&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Greater-than sign with equals\nsign\")]\n\nThe greater-than sign plus the equals sign (`>=`) is used for an approximation\nof the [greater than or equal to](/wiki/Greater_than_or_equal_to \"Greater than\nor equal to\") sign (≥, the opposite of ≤). ASCII doesn't have a greater-than-\nor-equal-to sign.\n\nIn [BASIC](/wiki/BASIC \"BASIC\"), [Lisp](/wiki/Lisp_\\(programming_language\\)\n\"Lisp \\(programming language\\)\")-family languages, and\n[C](/wiki/C_\\(programming_language\\) \"C \\(programming language\\)\")-family\nlanguages (including [Java](/wiki/Java_\\(programming_language\\) \"Java\n\\(programming language\\)\") and [C++](/wiki/C%2B%2B \"C++\")), operator `>=`\nmeans \"greater than or equal to\". In [Sinclair BASIC](/wiki/Sinclair_BASIC\n\"Sinclair BASIC\") it is encoded as a single-byte code point token.\n\nIn [Fortran](/wiki/Fortran \"Fortran\"), operator `.GE.` means \"greater than or\nequal to\".\n\nIn [Bourne shell](/wiki/Bourne_shell \"Bourne shell\") and [Windows\nPowerShell](/wiki/Windows_PowerShell \"Windows PowerShell\"), the operator `-ge`\nmeans \"greater than or equal to\".\n\n### Hyphen-minus with greater-than sign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-\nthan_sign&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Hyphen-minus with greater-than\nsign\")]\n\nIn some programming languages (for example\n[F#](/wiki/F_Sharp_\\(programming_language\\) \"F Sharp \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\")), the greater-than sign is used in conjunction with a [hyphen-\nminus](/wiki/Hyphen-minus \"Hyphen-minus\") to create an arrow (`->`). Arrows\nlike these could also be used in text where other [arrow\nsymbols](/wiki/Arrow_\\(symbol\\) \"Arrow \\(symbol\\)\") are unavailable. In the R\nprogramming language, this can be used as the right assignment operator. In\nthe C, C++, and C# programming languages, this is used as a member access\noperator.\n\n### Shell scripts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-\nthan_sign&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Shell scripts\")]\n\nIn [Bourne shell](/wiki/Bourne_shell \"Bourne shell\") (and many other shells),\ngreater-than sign is used to [redirect](/wiki/Redirection_\\(Unix\\)\n\"Redirection \\(Unix\\)\") output to a file. Greater-than plus ampersand (`>&`)\nis used to redirect to a [file descriptor](/wiki/File_descriptor \"File\ndescriptor\").\n\n### Spaceship operator[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-\nthan_sign&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Spaceship operator\")]\n\nGreater-than sign is used in the [spaceship operator](/wiki/Spaceship_operator\n\"Spaceship operator\").\n\n### HTML[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-than_sign&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: HTML\")]\n\nIn [HTML](/wiki/HTML \"HTML\") (and [SGML](/wiki/SGML \"SGML\") and\n[XML](/wiki/XML \"XML\")), the greater-than sign is used at the end of tags. The\ngreater-than sign may be included with `&gt;`, while `&ge;` produces the\ngreater-than or equal to sign.\n\n### E-mail and the Internet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Greater-\nthan_sign&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: E-mail and the Internet\")]\n\nThe greater-than sign is used to denote [quotations](/wiki/Quotation\n\"Quotation\") in the [e-mail](/wiki/E-mail \"E-mail\") and\n[newsgroup](/wiki/Newsgroup \"Newsgroup\") formats, and this has been taken into\nuse also in forums. It is also used before a sentence for a sense of\nimplication.
