The campaign\nlasted from December 5, 1955—the Monday after [Rosa Parks](/wiki/Rosa_Parks\n\"Rosa Parks\"), an [African American](/wiki/African_American \"African\nAmerican\") woman, was arrested for refusing to surrender her seat to a white\nperson—to December 20, 1956, when a federal ruling, _[Browder v.\nGayle](/wiki/Browder_v._Gayle \"Browder v.

As a result of this segregation\nAfrican Americans were not hired as drivers, were forced to ride in the back\nof the bus, and were frequently ordered to surrender their seats to white\npeople even though black passengers made up 75% of the bus system's riders.[2]\n\nAfrican-American passengers were also attacked by bus drivers and shortchanged\nand left stranded after paying their fares.[3] A number of reasons have been\ngiven for why bus drivers acted in this manner, including\n[racism](/wiki/Racism \"Racism\"),[4] frustrations over labor disputes and labor\nconditions, and increased animosity towards blacks in reaction to the 1954\n_[Brown decision](/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education \"Brown v. Board of\nEducation\"),_ with many of the drivers joining the [White Citizens\nCouncils](/wiki/Citizens%27_Councils \"Citizens' Councils\") as a result of the\ndecision.[5]\n\nThe boycott also took place within a larger statewide and national movement\nfor civil rights, including court cases such as Morgan v. Virginia, the\nearlier Baton Rouge bus boycott, and the arrest of Claudette Colvin.\n\n### _Morgan v. Virginia_\ndecision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Morgan v. Virginia decision\")]\n\nMain article: [Morgan v.

The drivers later went on strike\nafter city authorities refused to arrest Rev. [T.J.\nJemison](/wiki/T.J._Jemison \"T.J. Jemison\") for sitting in a front row.[12]\nFour days after the strike began, [Louisiana Attorney\nGeneral](/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Louisiana \"Attorney General of Louisiana\")\nand former [Baton Rouge](/wiki/Baton_Rouge \"Baton Rouge\") mayor [Fred S.\nLeBlanc](/wiki/Fred_S._LeBlanc \"Fred S. LeBlanc\") declared the ordinance\nunconstitutional under [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\") state law.[11]\nThis led Rev. Jemison to organize what historians believe to be the first bus\nboycott of the civil rights movement.[13] The boycott ended after eight days\nwhen an agreement was reached to only retain the first two front and back rows\nas racially reserved seating areas.[10]\n\n### Arrest of Claudette\nColvin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Arrest of Claudette Colvin\")]\n\nMain article: [Claudette Colvin](/wiki/Claudette_Colvin \"Claudette Colvin\")\n\nBlack activists had begun to build a case to challenge state bus segregation\nlaws around the arrest of a 15-year-old girl, [Claudette\nColvin](/wiki/Claudette_Colvin \"Claudette Colvin\"), a student at [Booker T.\nWashington](/wiki/Booker_T._Washington \"Booker T. Washington\") High School in\nMontgomery. On March 2, 1955, Colvin was handcuffed, arrested and forcibly\nremoved from a public bus when she refused to give up her seat to a white man.\nAt the time, Colvin was an active member in the [NAACP Youth\nCouncil](/wiki/NAACP_Youth_Council \"NAACP Youth Council\"); Rosa Parks was an\nadvisor.[14] Colvin's legal case formed the core of _Browder v. Gayle_ , which\nended the Montgomery bus boycott when the Supreme Court ruled on it in\nDecember 1956.\n\n### _Keys v. Carolina Coach Co._\ndecision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Keys v. Carolina Coach Co. decision\")]\n\nMain article: [Keys v. Carolina Coach Co.](/wiki/Keys_v._Carolina_Coach_Co.\n\"Keys v. Carolina Coach Co.\")\n\nIn November 1955, just three weeks before Parks' defiance of Jim Crow laws in\nMontgomery, the [Interstate Commerce\nCommission](/wiki/Interstate_Commerce_Commission \"Interstate Commerce\nCommission\"), in response to a complaint filed by [Women's Army\nCorps](/wiki/Women%27s_Army_Corps \"Women's Army Corps\") private Sarah Keys,\nclosed the legal loophole left by the Morgan ruling in a landmark case known\nas _[Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach\nCompany](/wiki/Sarah_Keys_v._Carolina_Coach_Company \"Sarah Keys v. Carolina\nCoach Company\")_.[15] The ICC prohibited individual carriers from imposing\ntheir own segregation rules on interstate travelers, declaring that to do so\nwas a violation of the anti-discrimination provision of the [Interstate\nCommerce Act](/wiki/Interstate_Commerce_Act \"Interstate Commerce Act\"). But\nneither the Supreme Court's Morgan ruling nor the ICC's Keys ruling addressed\nthe matter of Jim Crow travel within the individual states.\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nUnder the system of segregation used on Montgomery buses, the ten front seats\nwere reserved for whites at all times. The ten back seats were supposed to be\nreserved for blacks at all times. The middle section of the bus consisted of\nsixteen unreserved seats for whites and blacks on a segregated basis.[16]\nWhites filled the middle seats from the front to back, and blacks filled seats\nfrom the back to front until the bus was full. If other black people boarded\nthe bus, they were required to stand. If another white person boarded the bus,\nthen everyone in the black row nearest the front had to get up and stand, so\nthat a new row for white people could be created; it was illegal for whites\nand blacks to sit next to each other. When Rosa Parks refused to give up her\nseat for a white person, she was sitting in the first row of the middle\nsection.\n\nOften when boarding the buses, black people were required to pay at the front,\nget off, and reenter the bus through a separate door at the back.[17]\nOccasionally, bus drivers would drive away before black passengers were able\nto reboard.[18] [National City Lines](/wiki/National_City_Lines \"National City\nLines\") owned the Montgomery Bus Line at the time of the Montgomery bus\nboycott.[19]\n\n### Rosa\nParks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Rosa Parks\")]\n\nMain article: [Rosa Parks](/wiki/Rosa_Parks \"Rosa Parks\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Rosa_Parks_being_fingerprinted_by_Deputy_Sheriff_D.H._Lackey_after_being_arrested_for_boycotting_public_transportation_-\n_Original.jpg/290px-\nRosa_Parks_being_fingerprinted_by_Deputy_Sheriff_D.H._Lackey_after_being_arrested_for_boycotting_public_transportation_-\n_Original.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rosa_Parks_being_fingerprinted_by_Deputy_Sheriff_D.H._Lackey_after_being_arrested_for_boycotting_public_transportation_-\n_Original.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rosa_Parks_being_fingerprinted_by_Deputy_Sheriff_D.H._Lackey_after_being_arrested_for_boycotting_public_transportation_-\n_Original.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRosa Parks being fingerprinted by Deputy Sheriff D.H. Lackey after her arrest\nfor boycotting public transportation\n\n[Rosa Parks](/wiki/Rosa_Parks \"Rosa Parks\") (February 4, 1913 – October 24,\n2005) was a [seamstress](/wiki/Sewing \"Sewing\") by profession; she was also\nthe secretary for the Montgomery chapter of the\n[NAACP](/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People\n\"National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\"). Twelve years\nbefore her history-making arrest, Parks was stopped from boarding a city bus\nby driver [James F. Blake](/wiki/James_F._Blake \"James F. Blake\"), who ordered\nher to board at the back door and then drove off without her. Parks vowed\nnever again to ride a bus driven by Blake. As a member of the NAACP, Parks was\nan investigator assigned to cases of sexual assault. In 1945, she was sent to\n[Abbeville, Alabama](/wiki/Abbeville,_Alabama \"Abbeville, Alabama\"), to\ninvestigate the gang rape of [Recy Taylor](/wiki/Recy_Taylor \"Recy Taylor\").\nThe protest that arose around the Taylor case was the first instance of a\nnationwide civil rights protest, and it laid the groundwork for the Montgomery\nbus boycott.[20]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Rosaparks_busdiagram.jpg/220px-\nRosaparks_busdiagram.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rosaparks_busdiagram.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rosaparks_busdiagram.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA diagram showing the location where Rosa Parks sat which was in the\nunreserved section at the time of her arrest\n\nIn 1955, Parks completed a course in \"Race Relations\" at the [Highlander Folk\nSchool](/wiki/Highlander_Research_and_Education_Center \"Highlander Research\nand Education Center\") in Tennessee, where [nonviolent](/wiki/Nonviolent\n\"Nonviolent\") [civil disobedience](/wiki/Civil_disobedience \"Civil\ndisobedience\") had been discussed as a tactic. On December 1, 1955, Parks was\nsitting in the front row black people could sit in (the middle section). When\na white man boarded the bus, the bus driver told everyone in her row to move\nback. At that moment, Parks realized that she was again on a bus driven by\nBlake. While all of the other black people in her row complied, Parks refused,\nand she was arrested[21] for failing to obey the driver's seat assignments, as\ncity ordinances did not explicitly mandate segregation but did give the bus\ndriver authority to assign seats. Found guilty on December 5,[22] Parks was\nfined $10 plus a court cost of $4 _[23]_ , but she appealed.\n\n### E.

D. Nixon](/wiki/Edgar_Nixon \"Edgar\nNixon\"), president of the local\n[NAACP](/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People\n\"National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\") chapter and a\nmember of the [Brotherhood of Sleeping Car\nPorters](/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Sleeping_Car_Porters \"Brotherhood of Sleeping\nCar Porters\"). Nixon intended that her arrest be a [test\ncase](/wiki/Test_case_\\(law\\) \"Test case \\(law\\)\") to allow Montgomery's black\ncitizens to challenge segregation on the city's public buses. With this goal,\ncommunity leaders had been waiting for the right person to be arrested, a\nperson who would anger the black community into action, who would agree to\ntest the segregation laws in court, and who, most importantly, was \"above\nreproach\". When Colvin was arrested in March 1955, Nixon thought he had found\nthe perfect person, but the teenager turned out to be pregnant. Nixon later\nexplained, \"I had to be sure that I had somebody I could win with.\" Parks was\na good candidate because of her employment and marital status, along with her\ngood standing in the community.\n\nBetween Parks' arrest and trial, Nixon organized a meeting of local ministers\nat Martin Luther King Jr.'s church. Though Nixon could not attend the meeting\nbecause of his work schedule, he arranged that no election of a leader for the\nproposed boycott would take place until his return. When he returned, he\ncaucused with [Ralph Abernathy](/wiki/Ralph_Abernathy \"Ralph Abernathy\") and\nRev. E.N. French to name the association to lead the boycott to the city (they\nselected the \"[Montgomery Improvement\nAssociation](/wiki/Montgomery_Improvement_Association \"Montgomery Improvement\nAssociation\")\", \"MIA\"), and they selected King (Nixon's choice) to lead the\nboycott. Nixon wanted King to lead the boycott because the young minister was\nnew to Montgomery and the city fathers had not had time to intimidate him. At\na subsequent, larger meeting of ministers, Nixon's agenda was threatened by\nthe clergymen's reluctance to support the campaign. Nixon was indignant,\npointing out that their poor congregations worked to put money into the\ncollection plates so these ministers could live well, and when those\ncongregations needed the clergy to stand up for them, those comfortable\nministers refused to do so. Nixon threatened to reveal the ministers'\ncowardice to the black community, and King spoke up, denying he was afraid to\nsupport the boycott. King agreed to lead the MIA, and Nixon was elected its\ntreasurer.\n\n###\nBoycott[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Boycott\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Rosa_Parks_Bus.jpg/220px-\nRosa_Parks_Bus.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rosa_Parks_Bus.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rosa_Parks_Bus.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [National City Lines](/wiki/National_City_Lines \"National City Lines\")\nbus, No. 2857, on which Rosa Parks was riding before she was arrested (a [GM\n\"old-look\" transit bus](/wiki/GM_%22old-look%22_transit_bus \"GM \"old-look\"\ntransit bus\"), serial number 1132), is now on exhibit at the [Henry Ford\nMuseum](/wiki/Henry_Ford_Museum \"Henry Ford Museum\").\n\nOn the night of Rosa Parks' arrest, the [Women's Political\nCouncil](/wiki/Women%27s_Political_Council \"Women's Political Council\"), led\nby [Jo Ann Robinson](/wiki/Jo_Ann_Robinson \"Jo Ann Robinson\"), printed and\ncirculated a flyer[24] throughout Montgomery's black community that read as\nfollows:\n\n> Another woman has been arrested and thrown in jail because she refused to\n> get up out of her seat on the bus for a white person to sit down. It is the\n> second time since the [Claudette Colvin](/wiki/Claudette_Colvin \"Claudette\n> Colvin\") case that a Negro woman has been arrested for the same thing. This\n> has to be stopped.

But please, children and\n> grown-ups, don't ride the bus at all on Monday. Please stay off all buses\n> Monday.[23]\n\nThe next morning there was a meeting led by the new MIA head, King, where a\ngroup of 16 to 18 people gathered at the [Mt. Zion Church](/wiki/AME_Zion \"AME\nZion\") to discuss boycott strategies. At that time [Rosa\nParks](/wiki/Rosa_Parks \"Rosa Parks\") was introduced but not asked to speak,\ndespite a standing ovation and calls from the crowd for her to speak; when she\nasked if she should say something, the reply was, \"Why, you've said\nenough.\"[25] A citywide boycott of public transit was proposed to demand a\nfixed dividing line for the segregated sections of the buses. Such a line\nwould have meant that if the white section of the bus was oversubscribed,\nwhites would have to stand; blacks would not be forced to give up their seats\nto whites.\n\nThis demand was a compromise for the leaders of the boycott, who believed that\nthe city of Montgomery would be more likely to accept it rather than a demand\nfor a full integration of the buses. In this respect, the MIA leaders followed\nthe pattern of 1950s boycott campaigns in the [Deep South](/wiki/Deep_South\n\"Deep South\"), including the successful boycott a few years earlier of service\nstations in [Mississippi](/wiki/Mississippi \"Mississippi\") for refusing to\nprovide restrooms for blacks. The organizer of that campaign, [T. R. M.\nHoward](/wiki/T._R._M._Howard \"T. R. M. Howard\") of the [Regional Council of\nNegro Leadership](/wiki/Regional_Council_of_Negro_Leadership \"Regional Council\nof Negro Leadership\"), had spoken on the brutal slaying of [Emmett\nTill](/wiki/Emmett_Till \"Emmett Till\") as King's guest at the [Dexter Avenue\nBaptist Church](/wiki/Dexter_Avenue_Baptist_Church \"Dexter Avenue Baptist\nChurch\") only four days before Parks's arrest. Parks was in the audience and\nlater said that Emmett Till was on her mind when she refused to give up her\nseat.[26]\n\nThe MIA's demand for a fixed dividing line was to be supplemented by a\nrequirement that all bus passengers receive courteous treatment by bus\noperators, be seated on a first-come, first-served basis, and that blacks be\nemployed as bus drivers.[27] The proposal was passed, and the boycott was to\ncommence the following Monday. To publicize the impending boycott it was\nadvertised at black churches throughout Montgomery the following Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, December 3, it was evident that the black community would support\nthe boycott, and very few blacks rode the buses that day. On December 5, a\nmass meeting was held at the [Holt Street Baptist\nChurch](/wiki/Holt_Street_Baptist_Church \"Holt Street Baptist Church\") to\ndetermine if the protest would continue.[28] Given twenty minutes notice, King\ngave a speech[29] asking for a bus boycott and attendees enthusiastically\nagreed. Starting December 7, Hoover's FBI noted the \"agitation among negroes\"\nand tried to find \"derogatory information\" about King.[30]\n\nThe boycott proved extremely effective, with enough riders lost to the city\ntransit system to cause serious economic distress. Martin Luther King later\nwrote \"[a] miracle had taken place.\" Instead of riding buses, boycotters\norganized a system of carpools, with car owners volunteering their vehicles or\nthemselves driving people to various destinations. Some white housewives also\ndrove their black domestic servants to work. When the city pressured local\ninsurance companies to stop insuring cars used in the carpools, the boycott\nleaders arranged policies at [Lloyd's of London](/wiki/Lloyd%27s_of_London\n\"Lloyd's of London\").\n\nBlack [taxi](/wiki/Taxicab \"Taxicab\") drivers charged ten cents per ride, a\nfare equal to the cost to ride the bus, in support of the boycott. When word\nof this reached city officials on December 8, the order went out to fine any\ncab driver who charged a rider less than 45 cents. In addition to using\nprivate [motor vehicles](/wiki/Motor_vehicles \"Motor vehicles\"), some people\nused non-motorized means to get around, such as cycling, walking, or even\nriding mules or driving horse-drawn buggies. Some people also hitchhiked.\nDuring rush hours, sidewalks were often crowded. As the buses received few, if\nany, passengers, their officials asked the City Commission to allow stopping\nservice to black communities.[31] Across the nation, black churches raised\nmoney to support the boycott and collected new and slightly used shoes to\nreplace the tattered footwear of Montgomery's black citizens, many of whom\nwalked everywhere rather than ride the buses and submit to [Jim Crow\nlaws](/wiki/Jim_Crow_law \"Jim Crow law\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn response, opposing whites swelled the ranks of the [White Citizens'\nCouncil](/wiki/Citizens%27_Councils \"Citizens' Councils\"), the membership of\nwhich doubled during the course of the boycott. The councils sometimes\nresorted to violence: King's and Abernathy's houses were\n[firebombed](/wiki/Firebombing \"Firebombing\"), as were four black Baptist\nchurches. Boycotters were often physically attacked. After the attack at\nKing's house, he gave a speech to the 300 angry African Americans who had\ngathered outside. He said:\n\n> If you have weapons, take them home; if you do not have them, please do not\n> seek to get them. We cannot solve this problem through retaliatory violence.\n> We must meet violence with nonviolence. Remember the words of Jesus: \"He who\n> lives by the sword will perish by the sword\". We must love our white\n> brothers, no matter what they do to us. We must make them know that we love\n> them. Jesus still cries out in words that echo across the centuries: \"Love\n> your enemies; bless them that curse you; pray for them that despitefully use\n> you\". This is what we must live by. We must meet hate with love. Remember,\n> if I am stopped, this movement will not stop, because God is with the\n> movement. Go home with this glowing faith and this radiant assurance.[32]\n\nKing and 89 other boycott leaders and carpool drivers were indicted[33] for\nconspiring to interfere with a business under a 1921 ordinance.[34] Rather\nthan wait to be arrested, they boldly turned themselves in as an act of\ndefiance.\n\nKing was ordered to pay a $500 fine or serve 386 days in jail. He ended up\nspending two weeks in jail. The move backfired by bringing national attention\nto the protest. King commented on the arrest by saying: \"I was proud of my\ncrime. It was the crime of joining my people in a nonviolent protest against\ninjustice.\"[35]\n\nAlso important during the bus boycott were grass-roots activist groups that\nhelped to catalyze both fund-raising and morale. Groups such as the [Club from\nNowhere](/wiki/Georgia_Gilmore \"Georgia Gilmore\") helped to sustain the\nboycott by finding new ways of raising money and offering support to boycott\nparticipants.[36] Many members of these organizations were women and their\ncontributions to the effort have been described by some as essential to the\nsuccess of the bus boycott.[37][38]\n\n###\nVictory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Victory\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/381_days_01.jpg/220px-381_days_01.jpg)](/wiki/File:381_days_01.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:381_days_01.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Smithsonian Institution](/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution \"Smithsonian\nInstitution\") traveling exhibition[39] \"381 Days: The Montgomery Bus Boycott\"\nat the [Washington State History Museum](/wiki/Washington_State_History_Museum\n\"Washington State History Museum\").\n\nPressure increased across the country. The related civil suit was heard in\nfederal district court and, on June 4, 1956, the court ruled in _[Browder v.\nGayle](/wiki/Browder_v._Gayle \"Browder v. Gayle\")_ (1956) that Alabama's\nracial segregation laws for buses were unconstitutional. As the state appealed\nthe decision, the boycott continued. The case moved on to the [United States\nSupreme Court](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court \"United States Supreme\nCourt\"). On November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court upheld the district court's\nruling, ruling that segregation on public buses and transportation was against\nthe law.\n\nThe boycott officially ended December 20, 1956, after 381 days. The city\npassed an ordinance authorizing black bus passengers to sit virtually anywhere\nthey chose on buses. The Montgomery bus boycott resounded far beyond the\ndesegregation of public buses. It stimulated activism and participation from\nthe South in the national Civil Rights Movement and gave King national\nattention as a rising leader.[40][41]\n\n##\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\nWhite backlash against the court victory was quick, brutal, and, in the short-\nterm, effective.[42][43] Two days after the inauguration of desegregated\nseating, someone fired a shotgun through the front door of Martin Luther\nKing's home. A day later, on Christmas Eve, white men attacked a black\nteenager as she exited a bus. Four days after that, two buses were fired upon\nby snipers. In one sniper incident, a pregnant woman was shot in both legs. On\nJanuary 10, 1957, bombs destroyed five black churches and the home of Reverend\n[Robert S. Graetz](/wiki/Robert_Graetz \"Robert Graetz\"), one of the few white\nMontgomerians who had publicly sided with the MIA.[44][45]\n\nThe City suspended bus service for several weeks on account of the violence.\nAccording to legal historian [Randall Kennedy](/wiki/Randall_Kennedy \"Randall\nKennedy\"), \"When the violence subsided and service was restored, many black\nMontgomerians enjoyed their newly recognized right only abstractly... In\npractically every other setting, Montgomery remained overwhelmingly\nsegregated…\"[45] On January 23, a group of [Klansmen](/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan \"Ku\nKlux Klan\") (who would later be charged for the bombings)\n[lynched](/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States \"Lynching in the United States\")\na black man, [Willie Edwards](/wiki/Willie_Edwards \"Willie Edwards\"), on the\npretext that he was dating a white woman.[46]\n\nThe City's elite moved to strengthen segregation in other areas, and in March\n1957 passed an ordinance making it \"unlawful for white and colored persons to\nplay together, or, in company with each other . . . in any game of cards,\ndice, dominoes, checkers, pool, billiards, softball, basketball, baseball,\nfootball, golf, track, and at swimming pools, beaches, lakes or ponds or any\nother game or games or athletic contests, either indoors or outdoors.\"[45]\n\nLater in the year, Montgomery police charged seven\n[Klansmen](/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan \"Ku Klux Klan\") with the bombings, but all of\nthe defendants were acquitted. About the same time, the Alabama Supreme Court\nruled against Martin Luther King's appeal of his \"illegal boycott\"\nconviction.[47] Rosa Parks left Montgomery due to death threats and employment\nblacklisting.[48] According to [Charles Silberman](/wiki/Charles_Silberman\n\"Charles Silberman\"), \"by 1963, most Negroes in Montgomery had returned to the\nold custom of riding in the back of the bus.\"[49]\n\n##\nParticipants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Participants\")]\n\n###\nPeople[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Montgomery_bus_boycott&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: People\")]\n\n  * [Ralph Abernathy](/wiki/Ralph_Abernathy \"Ralph Abernathy\")\n  * [Hugo Black](/wiki/Hugo_Black \"Hugo Black\")\n  * [James F.
