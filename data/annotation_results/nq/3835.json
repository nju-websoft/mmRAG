When Major [George\nArmistead](/wiki/George_Armistead \"George Armistead\") expressed desire for a\nvery large flag to fly over the fort, General John S. Stricker and [Commodore\nJoshua Barney](/wiki/Joshua_Barney \"Joshua Barney\") placed an order with a\nprominent Baltimorean flagmaker for two oversized American Flags. The larger\nof the two flags would be the Great Garrison Flag, the largest battle flag\never flown at the time.[2] The smaller of the two flags would be the Storm\nFlag, to be more durable and less prone to fouling in inclement weather.\n\nAvailable documentation shows that this flag was sewn by local flagmaker [Mary\nYoung Pickersgill](/wiki/Mary_Young_Pickersgill \"Mary Young Pickersgill\")\nunder a government commission in 1813 at a cost of $405.90 (equivalent to\n$5,037 in 2016).[3][4] [George Armistead](/wiki/George_Armistead \"George\nArmistead\"), the commander of Fort McHenry, specified \"a flag so large that\nthe British would have no difficulty seeing it from a distance\".[5][6]\n\n### Design[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star-\nSpangled_Banner_\\(flag\\)&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Design\")]\n\nMary Pickersgill stitched the flag from a combination of cotton and dyed\nEnglish wool bunting, assisted by her daughter, two nieces, and an African\nAmerican [indentured servant](/wiki/Indentured_servant \"Indentured servant\").\n(Her elderly mother may also have helped.)[7] The flag has fifteen horizontal\nred and white stripes, as well as fifteen white stars in the blue field. The\ntwo additional stars and stripes, approved by the [United States\nCongress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\")'s [Flag\nAct](/wiki/Flag_Acts_\\(United_States\\) \"Flag Acts \\(United States\\)\") of 1794,\nrepresent [Vermont](/wiki/Vermont \"Vermont\") and [Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky\n\"Kentucky\")'s entrance into the Union. The stars are arranged in vertical\nrows, with five horizontal rows of stars, offset, each containing three stars.\nAt the time, the practice of adding stripes (in addition to stars) with the\ninduction of a new state had not yet been discontinued.\n\nThe flag originally measured 30 by 42 feet (9.1 by 12.8 m). Each of the\nfifteen stripes is 2 feet (0.61 m) wide, and each of the stars measures about\n2 feet (0.61 m) in diameter. After the battle, the Armistead family\noccasionally gave away pieces of the flag as souvenirs and gifts;[8] this\ncutting, along with deterioration from continued use, removed several feet of\nfabric from the flag's fly end, and it now measures 30 by 34 feet (9.1 by 10.4\nm). The flag currently has only fourteen starsâ€”the fifteenth star was\nsimilarly given as a gift, but its recipient and current whereabouts are\nunknown.[9]\n\n### Battle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star-\nSpangled_Banner_\\(flag\\)&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Battle\")]\n\nThe Flag was flown over the fort when 5,000\n[British](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Ireland\") soldiers and a fleet of 19 ships attacked\nBaltimore on September 12, 1814. The bombardment turned to Fort McHenry on the\nevening of September 13, and continuous shelling occurred for 25 hours under\nheavy rain. When the British ships were unable to pass the fort and penetrate\nthe harbor, the attack was ended, and on the morning of September 14, when the\nbattered flag still flew above the ramparts, it was clear that Fort McHenry\nremained in American hands. This revelation was famously captured in poetry by\nKey, an American lawyer and amateur poet. Being held by the British on a truce\nship in the [Patapsco River](/wiki/Patapsco_River \"Patapsco River\"), Key\nobserved the battle from afar. When he saw the Garrison Flag still flying at\ndawn of the morning of the 14th, he composed a poem he originally titled\n\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\". The poem would be put to the music of a common\ntune, retitled \"[The Star-Spangled Banner](/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner \"The\nStar-Spangled Banner\")\", and a portion of it would later be adopted as the\nUnited States National Anthem. Since its arrival at the Smithsonian, the flag\nhas undergone multiple preservation efforts.\n\n### Scrap sold at auction, November 2011[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star-\nSpangled_Banner_\\(flag\\)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Scrap sold at\nauction, November 2011\")]\n\nA 2-inch by 5-inch scrap of the flag - white and red, with a seam down the\nmiddle - was sold at auction in Dallas, TX on November 30, 2011, for $38,837:\nthe snippet was, presumably, cut from the famous flag as a souvenir in the\nmid-19th century.[10] The framed remnant came with a faded, hand-written note\nattesting it was \"_A piece of the Flag which floated over Fort McHenry at the\ntime of the bombardment when Key 's (_sic _) composed the Song of the Star\nSpangled Banner, presented by Sam Beth Cohen._ \"[11]\n\n## Smithsonian National Museum of American\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star-\nSpangled_Banner_\\(flag\\)&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Smithsonian\nNational Museum of American History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Pieces_of_the_Star_Spangled_banner_by_Matthew_Bisanz.JPG/200px-\nPieces_of_the_Star_Spangled_banner_by_Matthew_Bisanz.JPG)](/wiki/File:Pieces_of_the_Star_Spangled_banner_by_Matthew_Bisanz.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pieces_of_the_Star_Spangled_banner_by_Matthew_Bisanz.JPG\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nIn addition to the original flag on display, the\n[Smithsonian](/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution \"Smithsonian Institution\") also\nfeatures pieces from the flag that had been snipped off over the years as\npatriotic mementos\n\nThe flag that flew during that episode in history became a significant\nartifact. It remained in the possession of Major Armistead, who was promoted\nto [brevet](/wiki/Brevet_\\(military\\) \"Brevet \\(military\\)\") lieutenant\ncolonel, and his family for many years. Eben Appleton, Colonel Armistead's\ngrandson, inherited the flag in 1878. In 1907, he lent it to the Smithsonian\nInstitution, and in 1912 it was made a formal gift. Today it is permanently\nhoused in the [National Museum of American\nHistory](/wiki/National_Museum_of_American_History \"National Museum of\nAmerican History\"), one of the [Smithsonian\nInstitution](/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution \"Smithsonian Institution\") museums\non the [National Mall](/wiki/National_Mall \"National Mall\") in [Washington,\nD.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\") The flag was given to the\nmuseum in 1912, and has undergone multiple restoration efforts[12] after being\noriginally restored by [Amelia Fowler](/wiki/Amelia_Fowler \"Amelia Fowler\") in\n1914.\n\nDue to environmental and light damage a four phase restoration project began\nin May 1999. In the first phase, the team removed the linen support backing\nthat was attached to the flag during the 1914 restoration. The second phase\nconsisted of the most comprehensive, detailed examination of the condition and\nconstruction of the Star-Spangled Banner to date, which provided critical\ninformation for later work. This included scientific studies with infrared\nspectrometry, electron microscopy, mechanical testing, and determination of\namino acid content by a New Zealand scientist, and infrared imaging by a NASA\nscientist.[13] Planning and executing a cleaning treatment for the flag\nfollowing scientific analysis was the third phase. In the fourth and final\nphase of the project, curators, scientists and conservators developed a long-\nterm preservation plan. The restoration was completed in 2008 at a total cost\nin excess of $21 million.[14]\n\nFollowing the reopening of the [National Museum of American\nHistory](/wiki/National_Museum_of_American_History \"National Museum of\nAmerican History\") on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a two-\nstory display chamber that allows it to lie at a 10-degree angle in dim light.\nThe Smithsonian has created a permanent exhibition to document the flag's\nhistory and significance, called \"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag that\nInspired the [National Anthem](/wiki/National_Anthem \"National Anthem\")\".\nVisitors are allowed a clear view of the flag, while it remains protected in a\ncontrolled environment.[15][16][17]\n\nThe National Museum of American History produced an online exhibition in\nconjunction with the reopening of Flag Hall in 2008. An interactive component\nallows site visitors to closely explore features of the flag in detail,\ndownload an audiodescriptive tour of the exhibition for the visually-impaired,\nand hear the song performed on original instruments from the National Museum\nof American History's collection.[18]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star-\nSpangled_Banner_\\(flag\\)&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Flags of the United States](/wiki/Flags_of_the_United_States \"Flags of the United States\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star-\nSpangled_Banner_\\(flag\\)&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Keim, Kevin P. & Keim, Peter (2007).
