A couple\n(usually, but not in all cases) presents their living situation in the current\nhouse that they own. In most episodes, the couple is split on whether or not\nthey want to stay in the house.\n\nInterior designer [Hilary Farr](/wiki/Hilary_Farr \"Hilary Farr\") and real\nestate agent [David Visentin](/wiki/David_Visentin \"David Visentin\") tour the\ncouple's home before meeting with them. The tour usually consists of David\nfinding mostly negative things to say about the residence while Hilary is\nconvinced that she can work magic with whatever plans she is given.\n\nAt the meetup between the couple and the hosts of the show, both Hilary and\nDavid are briefed as to what the couple's desires are. Hilary is given a list\nof renovations the couple wants for the current house and her budget for the\nentire project. David, meanwhile, is tasked with searching for a new home for\nthe couple that both meets their needs and stays within their desired budget.\n\nCommon challenges faced by Hilary are an inadequate budget to complete the\nentire request list from the homeowners, often due to discovery of unforeseen\nissues with the house that are uncovered during the renovation such as lack of\ncompliance with modern building codes. Common issues for David, meanwhile,\ndepend on the homeowners' desires; for instance, the couple has children\nenrolled in the neighborhood school and they do not desire to change, or the\npotential house is too distant from family members or a workplace.\n\nAfter Hilary's renovation is complete, the homeowners are given a tour of\ntheir current home to see what she was able to accomplish. After the tour,\nDavid meets with them and hands them an evaluation of the home's current\nmarket value following the renovations. He will then remind the couple what\nthey could have in one of the new homes they looked at and that they would not\nget that in their current home.\n\nAfter a moment to deliberate, Hilary and David pose a question to the\nhomeowners. They must choose to either Love It, meaning that they will\ncontinue to live in their current home with the renovations, or to List It,\nmeaning that they will buy one of the homes David showed them and sell their\ncurrent home. After they reveal their decision, the homeowners explain their\nreasoning to Hilary and David (who, if they decided to Love It, reacts with\nincredulity) before bidding them farewell.\n\n## Host and\ncrew[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Love_It_or_List_It&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Host and crew\")]\n\n**Hosts**\n\n  * **[Hilary Farr](/wiki/Hilary_Farr \"Hilary Farr\")** – Hilary Farr is a home designer from [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\").
