Code points with\nlower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using\nfewer bytes. The first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one\nwith ASCII, are encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as\nASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well. Since\nASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non-ASCII code points into UTF-8, UTF-8\nis safe to use within most programming and document languages that interpret\ncertain ASCII characters in a special way, such as\n\"[/](/wiki/Slash_\\(punctuation\\) \"Slash \\(punctuation\\)\")\" in filenames,\n\"[\\](/wiki/Backslash \"Backslash\")\" in [escape\nsequences](/wiki/String_literal#Escape_sequences \"String literal\"), and \"%\" in\n[printf](/wiki/Printf \"Printf\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Utf8webgrowth.svg/350px-\nUtf8webgrowth.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Utf8webgrowth.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Utf8webgrowth.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nShows the usage of the main encodings on the web from 2001 to 2012 as recorded\nby Google,[6] with UTF-8 overtaking all others in 2008 and nearing 50% of the\nweb in 2012.  \nNote that the ASCII only figure includes web pages with any declared header if\nthey are restricted to ASCII characters.\n\nUTF-8 has been the dominant character encoding for the [World Wide\nWeb](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\") since 2009, as it's most popular\nin every country,[7] and as of April 2018 accounts for 91.2% of all (and 95.4%\nof top 1,000 highest ranked[8]) Web pages (some of which are simply ASCII, a\nsubset of UTF-8; the next-most popular multibyte encodings, [Shift\nJIS](/wiki/Shift_JIS \"Shift JIS\") and [GB 2312](/wiki/GB_2312 \"GB 2312\"), have\n0.6% and 0.5% respectively).[9][10][6] The [Internet Mail\nConsortium](/wiki/Internet_Mail_Consortium \"Internet Mail Consortium\") (IMC)\nrecommended that all e-mail programs be able to display and create mail using\nUTF-8,[11] and the [W3C](/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium \"World Wide Web\nConsortium\") recommends UTF-8 as the _default encoding_ in [XML](/wiki/XML\n\"XML\") and [HTML](/wiki/HTML \"HTML\").[12]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Description\n    * 1.1 Examples\n    * 1.2 Codepage layout\n    * 1.3 Overlong encodings\n    * 1.4 Invalid byte sequences\n    * 1.5 Invalid code points\n  * 2 Official name and variants\n  * 3 Derivatives\n    * 3.1 CESU-8\n    * 3.2 Modified UTF-8\n    * 3.3 WTF-8\n  * 4 Byte order mark\n  * 5 History\n  * 6 Comparison with single-byte encodings\n  * 7 Comparison with other multi-byte encodings\n  * 8 Comparison with UTF-16\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 Notes\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n## Description[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Description\")]\n\nSince the restriction of the Unicode code-space to 21-bit values in 2003,\nUTF-8 is defined to encode code points in one to four bytes, depending on the\nnumber of significant bits in the numerical value of the code point. The\nfollowing table shows the structure of the encoding. The `x` characters are\nreplaced by the bits of the code point. If the number of significant bits is\nno more than seven, the first line applies; if no more than 11 bits, the\nsecond line applies, and so on.\n\nNumber  \nof bytes | Bits for  \ncode point | First  \ncode point | Last  \ncode point | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | 7 | U+0000 | U+007F | `0xxxxxxx` |  |  |   \n2 | 11 | U+0080 | U+07FF | `110xxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` |  |   \n3 | 16 | U+0800 | U+FFFF | `1110xxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` |   \n4 | 21 | U+10000 | U+10FFFF | `11110xxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx`  \n  \nThe first 128 characters (US-ASCII) need one byte. The next 1,920 characters\nneed two bytes to encode, which covers the remainder of almost all [Latin-\nscript alphabets](/wiki/Latin-script_alphabet \"Latin-script alphabet\"), and\nalso [Greek](/wiki/Greek_alphabet \"Greek alphabet\"),\n[Cyrillic](/wiki/Cyrillic_script \"Cyrillic script\"),\n[Coptic](/wiki/Coptic_alphabet \"Coptic alphabet\"),\n[Armenian](/wiki/Armenian_alphabet \"Armenian alphabet\"),\n[Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet \"Hebrew alphabet\"),\n[Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_alphabet \"Arabic alphabet\"),\n[Syriac](/wiki/Syriac_alphabet \"Syriac alphabet\"), [Thaana](/wiki/Thaana\n\"Thaana\") and [N'Ko](/wiki/N%27Ko_alphabet \"N'Ko alphabet\") alphabets, as well\nas [Combining Diacritical Marks](/wiki/Combining_Diacritical_Marks \"Combining\nDiacritical Marks\"). Three bytes are needed for characters in the rest of the\n[Basic Multilingual Plane](/wiki/Basic_Multilingual_Plane \"Basic Multilingual\nPlane\"), which contains virtually all characters in common use[13] including\nmost [Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters](/wiki/CJK_characters \"CJK\ncharacters\"). Four bytes are needed for characters in the [other planes of\nUnicode](/wiki/Plane_\\(Unicode\\) \"Plane \\(Unicode\\)\"), which include less\ncommon [CJK characters](/wiki/CJK_characters \"CJK characters\"), various\nhistoric scripts, mathematical symbols, and [emoji](/wiki/Emoji \"Emoji\")\n(pictographic symbols).\n\nSome of the important features of this encoding are as follows:\n\n  * _Backward compatibility:_ Backwards compatibility with ASCII and the enormous amount of software designed to process ASCII-encoded text was the main driving force behind the design of UTF-8. In UTF-8, single bytes with values in the range of 0 to 127 map directly to Unicode code points in the ASCII range. Single bytes in this range represent characters, as they do in ASCII. Moreover, 7-bit bytes (bytes where the most significant bit is 0) never appear in a multi-byte sequence, and no valid multi-byte sequence decodes to an ASCII code-point. A sequence of 7-bit bytes is both valid ASCII and valid UTF-8, and under either interpretation represents the same sequence of characters. Therefore, the 7-bit bytes in a UTF-8 stream represent all and only the ASCII characters in the stream. Thus, many text processors, parsers, protocols, file formats, text display programs etc., which use ASCII characters for formatting and control purposes will continue to work as intended by treating the UTF-8 byte stream as a sequence of single-byte characters, without decoding the multi-byte sequences. ASCII characters on which the processing turns, such as punctuation, whitespace, and control characters will never be encoded as multi-byte sequences. It is therefore safe for such processors to simply ignore or pass-through the multi-byte sequences, without decoding them. For example, ASCII whitespace may be used to [tokenize](/wiki/Tokenize \"Tokenize\") a UTF-8 stream into words; ASCII line-feeds may be used to split a UTF-8 stream into lines; and ASCII NUL characters can be used to split UTF-8-encoded data into null-terminated strings. Similarly, many format strings used by library functions like \"printf\" will correctly handle UTF-8-encoded input arguments.\n  * _Fallback and auto-detection:_ UTF-8 provided backwards compatibility for 7-bit ASCII, but much software and data uses 8-bit [extended ASCII](/wiki/Extended_ASCII \"Extended ASCII\") encodings designed prior to the adoption of Unicode to represent the character sets of European languages. Part of the popularity of UTF-8 is due to the fact that it provides a form of backward compatibility for these as well. A UTF-8 processor which erroneously receives an [extended ASCII](/wiki/Extended_ASCII \"Extended ASCII\") file as input can \"fall back\" or replace 8-bit bytes using the appropriate code-point in the Unicode [Latin-1 Supplement](/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement \"Latin-1 Supplement\") block, when the 8-bit byte appears outside a valid multi-byte sequence. The bytes in extended ASCII encodings of “real world” text are typically not legal UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. This is because the bytes which _introduce_ multi-byte sequences in UTF-8 are primarily accented letters (mostly vowels) in the common extended ASCII encodings, and the UTF-8 _continuation_ bytes are punctuation and symbol characters. To appear as a valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, a series of 2 to 4 extended ASCII 8-bit characters would have to be an unusual combination of symbols and accented letters (such as an accented vowel followed immediately by certain punctuation). In short, real-world extended ASCII character sequences which look like valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are unlikely. Fallback errors will be false negatives, and these will be rare. Moreover, in many applications, such as text display, the consequence of incorrect fallback is usually slight. Only legibility is affected, and only for a few characters. These two things make fallback feasible, if somewhat imperfect. Indeed, as discussed further below, the [HTML5](/wiki/HTML5 \"HTML5\") standard requires that erroneous bytes in supposed UTF-8 data be replaced upon display on the assumption that they are [Windows-1252](/wiki/Windows-1252 \"Windows-1252\") characters. The presence of invalid 8-bit characters outside valid multi-byte sequences can also be used to \"auto-detect\" that an encoding is actually an extended ASCII encoding rather than UTF-8, and decode it accordingly. A UTF-8 stream may simply contain errors, resulting in the auto-detection scheme producing false positives; but auto-detection is successful in the majority of cases, especially with longer texts, and is widely used.\n  * _[Prefix code](/wiki/Prefix_code \"Prefix code\"):_ The first byte indicates the number of bytes in the sequence. Reading from a stream can instantaneously decode each individual fully received sequence, without first having to wait for either the first byte of a next sequence or an end-of-stream indication. The length of multi-byte sequences is easily determined by humans as it is simply the number of high-order 1s in the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream ends mid-sequence.\n  * _[Self-synchronization](/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code \"Self-synchronizing code\"):_ The leading bytes and the continuation bytes do not share values (continuation bytes start with `10` while single bytes start with `0` and longer lead bytes start with `11`). This means a search will not accidentally find the sequence for one character starting in the middle of another character. It also means the start of a character can be found from a random position by backing up at most 3 bytes to find the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream starts mid-sequence, and a shorter sequence will never appear inside a longer one.\n  * _Sorting order:_ The chosen values of the leading bytes and the fact that the continuation bytes have the high-order bits first means that a list of UTF-8 strings can be sorted in code point order by sorting the corresponding byte sequences.\n\n### Examples[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Examples\")]\n\nConsider the encoding of the [Euro sign](/wiki/Euro_sign \"Euro sign\"), €.\n\n  1. The Unicode code point for \"€\" is U+20AC.\n  2. According to the scheme table above, this will take three bytes to encode, since it is between U+0800 and U+FFFF.\n  3. Hexadecimal `20AC` is binary `0010 0000 1010 1100`. The two leading zeros are added because, as the scheme table shows, a three-byte encoding needs exactly sixteen bits from the code point.\n  4. Because the encoding will be three bytes long, its leading byte starts with three 1s, then a 0 (`1110...`)\n  5. The four most significant bits of the code point are stored in the remaining low order four bits of this byte (`1110 0010`), leaving 12 bits of the code point yet to be encoded (`...0000 1010 1100`).\n  6. All continuation bytes contain exactly six bits from the code point. So the next six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the next byte, and `10` is stored in the high order two bits to mark it as a continuation byte (so `1000 0010`).\n  7. Finally the last six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the final byte, and again `10` is stored in the high order two bits (`1010 1100`).\n\nThe three bytes `1110 0010` `1000 0010` `1010 1100` can be more concisely\nwritten in hexadecimal, as `E2 82 AC`.\n\nSince UTF-8 uses groups of six bits, it is sometimes useful to use\n[octal](/wiki/Octal \"Octal\") notation which uses 3-bit groups. With a\ncalculator which can convert between hexadecimal and octal it can be easier to\nmanually create or interpret UTF-8 compared with using binary.\n\n  * Octal 0200–3777 (hex 80-7FF) shall be coded with two bytes. xxyy will be 3xx 2yy.\n  * Octal 4000–177777 (hex 800-FFFF) shall be coded with three bytes. xxyyzz will be (340+xx) 2yy 2zz.\n  * Octal 200000-4177777 (hex 10000-10FFFF) shall be coded with four bytes. wxxyyzz will be 36w 2xx 2yy 2zz.\n\nThe following table summarises this conversion, as well as others with\ndifferent lengths in UTF-8. The colors indicate how bits from the code point\nare distributed among the UTF-8 bytes. Additional bits added by the UTF-8\nencoding process are shown in black.\n\nCharacter | Octal code point | Binary code point | Binary UTF-8 | Octal UTF-8 | Hexadecimal UTF-8  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n[$](/wiki/$ \"$\") | `U+0024` | `044` | `010 0100` | `00100100` | `044` | `24`  \n[¢](/wiki/%C2%A2 \"¢\") | `U+00A2` | `0242` | `000 1010 0010` | `11000010 10100010` | `302 242` | `C2 A2`  \n[€](/wiki/Euro_sign \"Euro sign\") | `U+20AC` | `020254` | `0010 0000 1010 1100` | `11100010 10000010 10101100` | `342 202 254` | `E2 82 AC`  \n[𐍈](/wiki/Hwair \"Hwair\") | `U+10348` | `0201510` | `0 0001 0000 0011 0100 1000` | `11110000 10010000 10001101 10001000` | `360 220 215 210` | `F0 90 8D 88`  \n  \n### Codepage layout[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Codepage layout\")]\n\nThe following table summarizes usage of UTF-8 _code units_ (individual bytes\nor octets) in a _code_ page format.

The hexadecimal number\nshown after a \"+\" plus sign is the value of the six bits they add.\n\nWhite cells are the leading bytes for a sequence of multiple bytes, the length\nshown at the left edge of the row. The text shows the Unicode blocks encoded\nby sequences starting with this byte, and the hexadecimal code point shown in\nthe cell is the lowest character value encoded using that leading byte.\n\nRed cells must never appear in a valid UTF-8 sequence. The first two red cells\n(C0 and C1) could be used only for a two-byte encoding of a 7-bit ASCII\ncharacter which should be encoded in one byte; as described below such\n\"overlong\" sequences are disallowed. The red cells in the F row (F5 to FD)\nindicate leading bytes of 4-byte or longer sequences that cannot be valid\nbecause they would encode code points larger than the U+10FFFF limit of\nUnicode (a limit derived from the maximum code point encodable in\n[UTF-16](/wiki/UTF-16 \"UTF-16\")), and FE and FF were never defined for any\npurpose in UTF-8.\n\nPink cells are the leading bytes for a sequence of multiple bytes, of which\nsome, but not all, possible continuation sequences are valid. E0 and F0 could\nstart overlong encodings, in this case the lowest non-overlong-encoded code\npoint is shown. F4 can start code points greater than U+10FFFF which are\ninvalid. ED can start the encoding of a code point in the range U+D800–U+DFFF;\nthese are invalid since they are reserved for UTF-16 surrogate halves.\n\n### Overlong encodings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Overlong encodings\")]\n\nIn principle, it would be possible to inflate the number of bytes in an\nencoding by padding the code point with leading 0s. To encode the Euro sign €\nfrom the above example in four bytes instead of three, it could be padded with\nleading 0s until it was 21 bits long – `000 000010 000010 101100`, and encoded\nas `11110000` `10000010` `10000010` `10101100` (or `F0` `82` `82` `AC` in\nhexadecimal). This is called an _overlong encoding_.\n\nThe standard specifies that the correct encoding of a code point use only the\nminimum number of bytes required to hold the significant bits of the code\npoint. Longer encodings are called _overlong_ and are not valid UTF-8\nrepresentations of the code point. This rule maintains a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between code points and their valid encodings, so that there is\na unique valid encoding for each code point. This ensures that string\ncomparisons and searches are well-defined.\n\nModified UTF-8 uses the two-byte overlong encoding of U+0000 (the [NUL\ncharacter](/wiki/Null_character \"Null character\")), `11000000` `10000000`\n(hexadecimal `C0` `80`), instead of `00000000` (hexadecimal `00`). This allows\nthe byte `00` to be used as a [string terminator](/wiki/Null-terminated_string\n\"Null-terminated string\").\n\n### Invalid byte\nsequences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section:\nInvalid byte sequences\")]\n\nNot all sequences of bytes are valid UTF-8. A UTF-8 decoder should be prepared\nfor:\n\n  * the red invalid bytes in the above table\n  * an unexpected continuation byte\n  * a leading byte not followed by enough continuation bytes (which can happen in simple string truncation)\n  * an overlong encoding as described above\n  * a sequence that decodes to an invalid code point as described below\n\nMany earlier decoders would happily try to decode these. Carefully crafted\ninvalid UTF-8 could make them either skip or create ASCII characters such as\nNUL, slash, or quotes. Invalid UTF-8 has been used to bypass security\nvalidations in high-profile products including Microsoft's\n[IIS](/wiki/Internet_Information_Services \"Internet Information Services\") web\nserver[14] and Apache's Tomcat servlet container.[15]\n\nRFC 3629 states \"Implementations of the decoding algorithm MUST protect\nagainst decoding invalid sequences.\"[16] _The Unicode Standard_ requires\ndecoders to \"...treat any ill-formed code unit sequence as an error condition.\nThis guarantees that it will neither interpret nor emit an ill-formed code\nunit sequence.\"\n\nMany UTF-8 decoders throw exceptions on encountering errors.[17] This can turn\nwhat would otherwise be harmless errors (producing a message such as \"no such\nfile\") into a [denial of service](/wiki/Denial_of_service \"Denial of service\")\nbug. Early versions of Python 3.0 would exit immediately if the command line\nor [environment variables](/wiki/Environment_variable \"Environment variable\")\ncontained invalid UTF-8,[18] making it impossible to handle such errors.\n\nMore recent converters translate the first byte of an invalid sequence to a\nreplacement character and continue parsing with the next byte. These error\nbytes will always have the high bit set. This avoids denial-of-service bugs,\nand it is very common in text rendering such as browser display, since mangled\ntext is probably more useful than nothing for helping the user figure out what\nthe string was supposed to contain. Popular replacements include:\n\n  * The [replacement character](/wiki/Specials_\\(Unicode_block\\)#Replacement_character \"Specials \\(Unicode block\\)\") \"�\" (U+FFFD)\n  * The invalid Unicode code points U+DC80–U+DCFF where the low eight bits are the byte's value.[19] Sometimes it is called UTF-8B.[20]\n  * The Unicode code points U+0080–U+00FF with the same value as the byte, thus interpreting the bytes according to [ISO-8859-1](/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1 \"ISO/IEC 8859-1\")[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n  * The Unicode code point for the character represented by the byte in [CP1252](/wiki/Windows-1252 \"Windows-1252\"),[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] which is similar to using ISO-8859-1, except that some characters in the range 0x80–0x9F are mapped into different Unicode code points. For example, 0x80 becomes the Euro sign, U+20AC.\n\nThese replacement algorithms are \"[lossy](/wiki/Lossy \"Lossy\")\", as more than\none sequence is translated to the same code point. This means that it would\nnot be possible to reliably convert back to the original encoding, therefore\nlosing information. Reserving 128 code points (such as U+DC80–U+DCFF) to\nindicate errors, and defining the UTF-8 encoding of these points as invalid so\nthey convert to 3 errors, would seem to make conversion lossless. But this\nruns into practical difficulties: the converted text cannot be modified such\nthat errors are arranged so they convert back into valid UTF-8, which means if\nthe conversion is UTF-16, it cannot also be used to store arbitrary invalid\nUTF-16, which is usually needed on the same systems that need invalid UTF-8.\nU+DC80–U+DCFF are reserved for UTF-16 surrogates, so that when they are used\nfor UTF-8 in this way, and the string is converted to UTF-16 this can lead to\nbugs or the string being rejected.\n\nThe large number of invalid byte sequences provides the advantage of making it\neasy to have a program accept both UTF-8 and legacy encodings such as\nISO-8859-1. Software can check for UTF-8 correctness, and if that fails assume\nthe input to be in the legacy encoding. It is technically true that this may\ndetect an ISO-8859-1 string as UTF-8, but this is very unlikely if it contains\nany 8-bit bytes as they _all_ have to be in unusual patterns of two or more in\na row, such as \"Â£\".\n\n### Invalid code points[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Invalid code points\")]\n\nSince [RFC 3629](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629) (November 2003), the\nhigh and low surrogate halves used by [UTF-16](/wiki/UTF-16 \"UTF-16\") (U+D800\nthrough U+DFFF) and code points not encodable by UTF-16 (those after U+10FFFF)\nare not legal Unicode values, and their UTF-8 encoding must be treated as an\ninvalid byte sequence.\n\nNot decoding surrogate halves makes it impossible to store invalid UTF-16,\nsuch as Windows filenames, as UTF-8. To preserve these invalid UTF-16\nsequences, their corresponding UTF-8 encodings are sometimes allowed by\nimplementations despite the above rule. There are attempts to define this\nbehavior formally (see WTF-8 and CESU below).\n\n## Official name and\nvariants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section:\nOfficial name and variants\")]\n\nThe official [Internet Assigned Numbers\nAuthority](/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority \"Internet Assigned\nNumbers Authority\") (IANA) code for the encoding is \"UTF-8\".[21] All letters\nare upper-case, and the name is hyphenated. This spelling is used in all the\nUnicode Consortium documents relating to the encoding.\n\nAlternatively, the name \"utf-8\" may be used by all standards conforming to the\nIANA list (which include [CSS](/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets \"Cascading Style\nSheets\"), [HTML](/wiki/HTML \"HTML\"), [XML](/wiki/XML \"XML\"), and [HTTP\nheaders](/wiki/List_of_HTTP_headers \"List of HTTP headers\")),[22] as the\ndeclaration is case insensitive.[21]\n\nOther descriptions that omit the hyphen or replace it with a space, such as\n\"utf8\" or \"UTF 8\", are not accepted as correct by the governing standards.[16]\nDespite this, most agents such as browsers can understand them, and so\nstandards intended to describe existing practice (such as HTML5) may\neffectively require their recognition.\n\nUnofficially, UTF-8-BOM and UTF-8-NOBOM are sometimes used to refer to text\nfiles which respectively contain and lack a [byte order\nmark](/wiki/Byte_order_mark \"Byte order mark\") (BOM).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\nJapan especially, UTF-8 encoding without BOM is sometimes called\n\"UTF-8N\".[23][24]\n\nSupported [Windows](/wiki/Windows \"Windows\") versions, i.e. Windows 7 and\nlater, have [codepage](/wiki/Codepage \"Codepage\") 65001, as a synonym for\nUTF-8 (with better support than in older Windows),[25] and Microsoft has a\nscript for Windows 10, to enable it by default for its notepad program.[26]\n\nIn [PCL](/wiki/Printer_Command_Language \"Printer Command Language\"), UTF-8 is\ncalled Symbol-ID \"18N\" (PCL supports 183 character encodings, called Symbol\nSets, which potentially could be reduced to one, 18N, that is UTF-8).[27]\n\n## Derivatives[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Derivatives\")]\n\nThe following implementations show slight differences from the UTF-8\nspecification. They are incompatible with the UTF-8 specification and may be\nrejected by conforming UTF-8 applications.\n\n### CESU-8[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: CESU-8\")]\n\nMain article: [CESU-8](/wiki/CESU-8 \"CESU-8\")\n\nMany programs added UTF-8 conversions for [UCS-2](/wiki/UCS-2 \"UCS-2\") data\nand did not alter this UTF-8 conversion when UCS-2 was replaced with the\nsurrogate-pair using [UTF-16](/wiki/UTF-16 \"UTF-16\"). In such programs each\nhalf of a UTF-16 surrogate pair is encoded as its own three-byte UTF-8\nencoding, resulting in six-byte sequences rather than four bytes for\ncharacters outside the [Basic Multilingual\nPlane](/wiki/Basic_Multilingual_Plane \"Basic Multilingual Plane\").\n[Oracle](/wiki/Oracle_Database \"Oracle Database\") and [MySQL](/wiki/MySQL\n\"MySQL\") databases use this, as well as Java and Tcl as described below, and\nprobably many Windows programs where the programmers were unaware of the\ncomplexities of UTF-16. Although this non-optimal encoding is generally not\ndeliberate, a supposed benefit is that it preserves UTF-16 binary sorting\norder when CESU-8 is binary sorted.\n\n### Modified UTF-8[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Modified UTF-8\")]\n\nIn Modified UTF-8 (MUTF-8),[28] the [null character](/wiki/Null_character\n\"Null character\") (U+0000) uses the two-byte overlong encoding `11000000`\n`10000000` (hexadecimal `C0` `80`), instead of `00000000` (hexadecimal `00`).\nModified UTF-8 strings never contain any actual null bytes but can contain all\nUnicode code points including U+0000,[29] which allows such strings (with a\nnull byte appended) to be processed by traditional [null-terminated\nstring](/wiki/Null-terminated_string \"Null-terminated string\") functions.\n\nAll known Modified UTF-8 implementations also treat the surrogate pairs as in\n[CESU-8](/wiki/CESU-8 \"CESU-8\").\n\nIn normal usage, the [Java programming\nlanguage](/wiki/Java_\\(programming_language\\) \"Java \\(programming language\\)\")\nsupports standard UTF-8 when reading and writing strings through\n`[InputStreamReader](//docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/io/InputStreamReader.html)`\nand\n`[OutputStreamWriter](//docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/io/OutputStreamWriter.html)`\n(if it is the platform's default character set or as requested by the\nprogram). However it uses Modified UTF-8 for object\n[serialization](/wiki/Java_serialization \"Java serialization\")[30] among other\napplications of\n`[DataInput](//docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html)` and\n`[DataOutput](//docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/io/DataOutput.html)`,\nfor the [Java Native Interface](/wiki/Java_Native_Interface \"Java Native\nInterface\"),[31] and for embedding constant strings in [class\nfiles](/wiki/Class_\\(file_format\\) \"Class \\(file format\\)\").[32] The dex\nformat defined by [Dalvik](/wiki/Dalvik_\\(software\\) \"Dalvik \\(software\\)\")\nalso uses the same modified UTF-8 to represent string values.[33]\n[Tcl](/wiki/Tcl \"Tcl\") also uses the same modified UTF-8[34] as Java for\ninternal representation of Unicode data, but uses strict CESU-8 for external\ndata.\n\n### WTF-8[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: WTF-8\")]\n\nWTF-8 (Wobbly Transformation Format – 8-bit) is an extension of UTF-8 where\nthe encodings of the surrogate halves (U+D800 through U+DFFF) are allowed.[35]\nThis is necessary to store possibly-invalid UTF-16, such as Windows filenames.\nMany systems that deal with UTF-8 work this way without considering it a\ndifferent encoding, as it is simpler.\n\nWTF-8 has been used to refer to [erroneously doubly-encoded\nUTF-8](/wiki/Mojibake \"Mojibake\").[36][37][38]\n\n## Byte order mark[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Byte order mark\")]\n\nMain article: [Byte order mark](/wiki/Byte_order_mark \"Byte order mark\")\n\nMany [Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\") programs\n(including Windows [Notepad](/wiki/Notepad_\\(Windows\\) \"Notepad \\(Windows\\)\"))\nadd the bytes 0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF at the start of any document saved as UTF-8.\nThis is the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode [byte order\nmark](/wiki/Byte_order_mark \"Byte order mark\") (BOM), and is commonly referred\nto as a UTF-8 BOM, even though it is not relevant to byte order. A BOM can\nalso appear if another encoding with a BOM is translated to UTF-8 without\nstripping it. Software that is not aware of multibyte encodings will display\nthe BOM as three [garbage characters](/wiki/Garbage_characters \"Garbage\ncharacters\") at the start of the document, e.g. \"`ï»¿`\" in software\ninterpreting the document as [ISO 8859-1](/wiki/ISO_8859-1 \"ISO 8859-1\") or\n[Windows-1252](/wiki/Windows-1252 \"Windows-1252\") or \"`∩╗┐`\" if interpreted as\n[code page 437](/wiki/Code_page_437 \"Code page 437\"), a default for certain\nolder Windows [console applications](/wiki/Console_application \"Console\napplication\").\n\nThe Unicode Standard neither requires nor recommends the use of the BOM for\nUTF-8, but warns that it may be encountered at the start of a file as a\ntranscoding artifact.[39] The presence of the UTF-8 BOM may cause problems\nwith existing software that can handle UTF-8, for example:\n\n  * Programming language parsers not explicitly designed for UTF-8 can often handle UTF-8 in string constants and comments, but will choke on encountering an UTF-8 BOM at the start of the file.\n  * Programs that identify file types by leading characters may fail to identify the file if a UTF-8 BOM is present even if the user of the file could skip the BOM. An example is the Unix [shebang](/wiki/Shebang_\\(Unix\\) \"Shebang \\(Unix\\)\") syntax. Another example is [Internet Explorer](/wiki/Internet_Explorer \"Internet Explorer\") which will render pages in standards mode only when it starts with a [document type declaration](/wiki/Document_type_declaration \"Document type declaration\")[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_].\n  * Programs that insert information at the start of a file will break use of the BOM to identify UTF-8 (one example is [offline browsers](/wiki/Offline_browser \"Offline browser\") that add the originating URL to the start of the file[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]).\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nBy early 1992, the search was on for a good byte stream encoding of multi-byte\ncharacter sets. The draft [ISO 10646](/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set\n\"Universal Coded Character Set\") standard contained a non-required\n[annex](/wiki/Addendum \"Addendum\") called [UTF-1](/wiki/UTF-1 \"UTF-1\") that\nprovided a byte stream encoding of its [32-bit](/wiki/32-bit \"32-bit\") code\npoints. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other\nproblems, and the biggest problem was probably that it did not have a clear\nseparation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward\ncompatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse\nexisting code expecting ASCII (or [extended ASCII](/wiki/Extended_ASCII\n\"Extended ASCII\")), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range\n0x21–0x7E that meant something else in ASCII, e.g., 0x2F for '/', the\n[Unix](/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") [path](/wiki/Path_\\(computing\\) \"Path\n\\(computing\\)\") directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name\nand introductory text of its replacement. The table below was derived from a\ntextual description in the annex.\n\n[UTF-1](/wiki/UTF-1 \"UTF-1\") Number  \nof bytes | First  \ncode point | Last  \ncode point | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | U+0000 | U+009F | 00–9F |  |  |  |   \n2 | U+00A0 | U+00FF | A0 | A0–FF |  |  |   \n2 | U+0100 | U+4015 | A1–F5 | 21–7E, A0–FF |  |  |   \n3 | U+4016 | U+38E2D | F6–FB | 21–7E, A0–FF | 21–7E, A0–FF |  |   \n5 | U+38E2E | U+7FFFFFFF | FC–FF | 21–7E, A0–FF | 21–7E, A0–FF | 21–7E, A0–FF | 21–7E, A0–FF  \n  \nIn July 1992, the [X/Open](/wiki/X/Open \"X/Open\") committee XoJIG was looking\nfor a better encoding. Dave Prosser of [Unix System\nLaboratories](/wiki/Unix_System_Laboratories \"Unix System Laboratories\")\nsubmitted a proposal for one that had faster implementation characteristics\nand introduced the improvement that 7-bit ASCII characters would only\nrepresent themselves; all multibyte sequences would include only bytes where\nthe high bit was set. The name File System Safe\n[UCS](/wiki/Universal_Character_Set \"Universal Character Set\") Transformation\nFormat (FSS-UTF) and most of the text of this proposal were later preserved in\nthe final specification.[40][41][42][43]\n\nFSS-UTF proposal (1992) Number  \nof bytes | Bits for  \ncode point | First  \ncode point | Last  \ncode point | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | 7 | U+0000 | U+007F | `0xxxxxxx` |  |  |  |   \n2 | 13 | U+0080 | U+207F | `10xxxxxx` | `1xxxxxxx` |  |  |   \n3 | 19 | U+2080 | U+8207F | `110xxxxx` | `1xxxxxxx` | `1xxxxxxx` |  |   \n4 | 25 | U+82080 | U+208207F | `1110xxxx` | `1xxxxxxx` | `1xxxxxxx` | `1xxxxxxx` |   \n5 | 31 | U+2082080 | U+7FFFFFFF | `11110xxx` | `1xxxxxxx` | `1xxxxxxx` | `1xxxxxxx` | `1xxxxxxx`  \n  \nIn August 1992, this proposal was circulated by an [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\")\nX/Open representative to interested parties. A modification by [Ken\nThompson](/wiki/Ken_Thompson \"Ken Thompson\") of the [Plan\n9](/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs \"Plan 9 from Bell Labs\") [operating\nsystem](/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\") group at [Bell\nLabs](/wiki/Bell_Labs \"Bell Labs\") made it somewhat less bit-efficient than\nthe previous proposal but crucially allowed it to be [self-\nsynchronizing](/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code \"Self-synchronizing code\"),\nletting a reader start anywhere and immediately detect byte sequence\nboundaries. It also abandoned the use of biases and instead added the rule\nthat only the shortest possible encoding is allowed; the additional loss in\ncompactness is relatively insignificant, but readers now have to look out for\ninvalid encodings to avoid reliability and especially security issues.\nThompson's design was outlined on September 2, 1992, on a\n[placemat](/wiki/Placemat \"Placemat\") in a New Jersey diner with [Rob\nPike](/wiki/Rob_Pike \"Rob Pike\"). In the following days, Pike and Thompson\nimplemented it and updated [Plan 9](/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs \"Plan 9 from\nBell Labs\") to use it throughout, and then communicated their success back to\nX/Open, which accepted it as the specification for FSS-UTF.[42]\n\nFSS-UTF (1992) / UTF-8 (1993)[3] Number  \nof bytes | Bits for  \ncode point | First  \ncode point | Last  \ncode point | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5 | Byte 6  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | 7 | U+0000 | U+007F | `0xxxxxxx` |  |  |  |  |   \n2 | 11 | U+0080 | U+07FF | `110xxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` |  |  |  |   \n3 | 16 | U+0800 | U+FFFF | `1110xxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` |  |  |   \n4 | 21 | U+10000 | U+1FFFFF | `11110xxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` |  |   \n5 | 26 | U+200000 | U+3FFFFFF | `111110xx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` |   \n6 | 31 | U+4000000 | U+7FFFFFFF | `1111110x` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx`  \n  \nUTF-8 was first officially presented at the [USENIX](/wiki/USENIX \"USENIX\")\nconference in [San Diego](/wiki/San_Diego \"San Diego\"), from January 25 to 29,\n1993.\n\nIn November 2003, UTF-8 was restricted by [RFC\n3629](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629) to match the constraints of the\n[UTF-16](/wiki/UTF-16 \"UTF-16\") character encoding: explicitly prohibiting\ncode points corresponding to the high and low surrogate characters removed\nmore than 3% of the three-byte sequences, and ending at U+10FFFF removed more\nthan 48% of the four-byte sequences and all five- and six-byte sequences.\n\nGoogle reported that in 2008, UTF-8 (labelled \"Unicode\") became the most\ncommon encoding for HTML files.[44]\n\n## Comparison with single-byte\nencodings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Comparison with single-byte encodings\")]\n\n  * UTF-8 can encode any [Unicode](/wiki/Unicode \"Unicode\") character, avoiding the need to figure out and set a \"[code page](/wiki/Code_page \"Code page\")\" or otherwise indicate what character set is in use, and allowing output in multiple scripts at the same time. For many scripts there have been more than one single-byte encoding in usage, so even knowing the script was insufficient information to display it correctly.\n  * The bytes 0xFE and 0xFF do not appear, so a valid UTF-8 stream never matches the UTF-16 [byte order mark](/wiki/Byte_order_mark \"Byte order mark\") and thus cannot be confused with it. The absence of 0xFF (0377) also eliminates the need to escape this byte in [Telnet](/wiki/Telnet \"Telnet\") (and FTP control connection).\n  * UTF-8 encoded text is larger than specialized single-byte encodings except for plain ASCII characters. In the case of scripts which used 8-bit character sets with non-Latin characters encoded in the upper half (such as most [Cyrillic](/wiki/Cyrillic_script \"Cyrillic script\") and [Greek alphabet](/wiki/Greek_alphabet \"Greek alphabet\") code pages), characters in UTF-8 will be double the size. For some scripts, such as [Thai](/wiki/Thai_alphabet \"Thai alphabet\") and [Devanagari](/wiki/Devanagari \"Devanagari\") (which is used by various South Asian languages), characters will triple in size. There are even examples where a single byte turns into a composite character in Unicode and is thus six times larger in UTF-8. This has caused objections in India and other countries.\n  * It is possible in UTF-8 (or any other multi-byte encoding) to split or [truncate](/wiki/Data_truncation \"Data truncation\") a string in the middle of a character. This can result in an invalid string which some software refuses to accept. A good parser should ignore a truncated character at the end, which is easy in UTF-8 but tricky in some other multi-byte encodings.\n  * If the code points are all the same size, measurements of a fixed number of them is easy. Due to ASCII-era documentation where \"character\" is used as a synonym for \"byte\" this is often considered important. However, by measuring string positions using bytes instead of \"characters\" most algorithms can be easily and efficiently adapted for UTF-8. Searching for a string within a long string can for example be done byte by byte; the self-synchronization property prevents false positives.\n  * Some software, such as text editors, will refuse to correctly display or interpret UTF-8 unless the text starts with a [byte order mark](/wiki/Byte_order_mark \"Byte order mark\"), and will insert such a mark. This has the effect of making it impossible to use UTF-8 with any older software that can handle ASCII-like encodings but cannot handle the byte order mark. This, however, is no problem of UTF-8 itself but one of bad software implementations.\n\n## Comparison with other multi-byte\nencodings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Comparison with other multi-byte encodings\")]\n\n  * UTF-8 can encode any [Unicode](/wiki/Unicode \"Unicode\") character. Files in different scripts can be displayed correctly without having to choose the correct code page or font. For instance Chinese and Arabic can be supported (in the same text) without special codes inserted or manual settings to switch the encoding.\n  * UTF-8 is [self-synchronizing](/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code \"Self-synchronizing code\"): character boundaries are easily identified by scanning for well-defined bit patterns in either direction. If bytes are lost due to error or [corruption](/wiki/Data_corruption \"Data corruption\"), one can always locate the next valid character and resume processing. If there is a need to shorten a string to fit a specified field, the previous valid character can easily be found. Many multi-byte encodings are much harder to resynchronize.\n  * Any [byte oriented](/wiki/Byte_orientation \"Byte orientation\") [string searching algorithm](/wiki/String_searching_algorithm \"String searching algorithm\") can be used with UTF-8 data, since the sequence of bytes for a character cannot occur anywhere else. Some older variable-length encodings (such as [Shift JIS](/wiki/Shift_JIS \"Shift JIS\")) did not have this property and thus made string-matching algorithms rather complicated. In Shift JIS the end byte of a character and the first byte of the next character could look like another legal character, something that can't happen in UTF-8.\n  * Efficient to encode using simple [bit operations](/wiki/Bit_operation \"Bit operation\"). UTF-8 does not require slower mathematical operations such as multiplication or division (unlike Shift JIS, [GB 2312](/wiki/GB_2312 \"GB 2312\") and other encodings).\n  * UTF-8 will take more space than a multi-byte encoding designed for a specific script. East Asian legacy encodings generally used two bytes per character yet take three bytes per character in UTF-8.\n\n## Comparison with\nUTF-16[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section:\nComparison with UTF-16\")]\n\n  * Byte encodings and UTF-8 are represented by byte arrays in programs, and often nothing needs to be done to a function when converting from a byte encoding to UTF-8. [UTF-16](/wiki/UTF-16 \"UTF-16\") is represented by 16-bit word arrays, and converting to UTF-16 while maintaining compatibility with existing [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII \"ASCII\")-based programs (such as was done with Windows) requires _every_ API and data structure that takes a string to be duplicated, one version accepting byte strings and another version accepting UTF-16.\n  * Text encoded in UTF-8 will be smaller than the same text encoded in UTF-16 if there are more code points below U+0080 than in the range U+0800..U+FFFF. This is true for all modern European languages. \n    * Text in (for example) Chinese, Japanese or Devanagari will take more space in UTF-8 if there are more of these characters than there are ASCII characters. This is likely when data mainly consist of pure prose, but is lessened by the degree to which the context uses ASCII whitespace, digits, and punctuation.[nb 1]\n    * Most of the [rich text formats](/wiki/Formatted_text \"Formatted text\") (including HTML) contain a large proportion of ASCII characters for the sake of formatting, thus the size usually will be reduced significantly compared with UTF-16, even when the language mostly uses 3-byte long characters in UTF-8.[nb 2]\n  * Most communication (e.g. HTML and IP) and storage (e.g. for Unix) was designed for a [stream of bytes](/wiki/Bitstream#Definition_of_bytestream \"Bitstream\"). A UTF-16 string must use a pair of bytes for each code unit: \n    * The order of those two bytes becomes an issue and must be specified in the UTF-16 protocol, such as with a [byte order mark](/wiki/Byte_order_mark \"Byte order mark\").\n    * If an _odd_ number of bytes is missing from UTF-16, the whole rest of the string will be meaningless text. Any bytes missing from UTF-8 will still allow the text to be recovered accurately starting with the next character after the missing bytes.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Alt code](/wiki/Alt_code \"Alt code\")\n  * [Character encodings in HTML](/wiki/Character_encodings_in_HTML \"Character encodings in HTML\")\n  * [Comparison of e-mail clients § Features](/wiki/Comparison_of_e-mail_clients#Features \"Comparison of e-mail clients\")\n  * [Comparison of Unicode encodings](/wiki/Comparison_of_Unicode_encodings \"Comparison of Unicode encodings\")\n  * [GB 18030](/wiki/GB_18030 \"GB 18030\")\n  * [Iconv](/wiki/Iconv \"Iconv\") – a standardized [API](/wiki/Application_programming_interface \"Application programming interface\") used to convert between different [character encodings](/wiki/Character_encoding \"Character encoding\")\n  * [ISO/IEC 8859](/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859 \"ISO/IEC 8859\")\n  * [Specials (Unicode block)](/wiki/Specials_\\(Unicode_block\\) \"Specials \\(Unicode block\\)\")\n  * [Unicode and e-mail](/wiki/Unicode_and_e-mail \"Unicode and e-mail\")\n  * [Unicode and HTML](/wiki/Unicode_and_HTML \"Unicode and HTML\")\n  * [Universal Character Set](/wiki/Universal_Character_Set \"Universal Character Set\")\n  * [UTF-8 in URIs](/wiki/Percent-encoding#Current_standard \"Percent-encoding\")\n  * [UTF-EBCDIC](/wiki/UTF-EBCDIC \"UTF-EBCDIC\")\n  * [UTF-9 and UTF-18](/wiki/UTF-9_and_UTF-18 \"UTF-9 and UTF-18\")\n  * [UTF-16/UCS-2](/wiki/UTF-16/UCS-2 \"UTF-16/UCS-2\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=UTF-8&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section:\nNotes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** The 2010-11-22 version of [यूनिकोड](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A1 \"hi:यूनिकोड\") (Unicode in Hindi), when the pure text was pasted to Notepad, generated 19 KB when saved as UTF-16 and 22 KB when saved as UTF-8.\n  2. **Jump up ^** The 2010-10-27 version of [UTF-8](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 \"ja:UTF-8\") generated 169 KB when converted with Notepad to UTF-16, and only 101 KB when converted back to UTF-8.
