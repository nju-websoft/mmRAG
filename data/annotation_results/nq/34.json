        "# Jinx (children's game)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**Jinx** is a [children's game](/wiki/List_of_traditional_children%27s_games\n\"List of traditional children's games\") with varying rules and penalties that\noccur when two people unintentionally speak the same word or phrase\n[simultaneously](/wiki/Simultaneous \"Simultaneous\").[1][2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Rules\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n##\nRules[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jinx_\\(children%27s_game\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Rules\")]\n\nA jinx can be initiated when at least two people say any same word or phrase\nat the same time.[3] One of them then calls \"jinx\" on the other.\n\nThe game ends when someone speaks the jinxee's name or the jinxee speaks. In\nthe latter case, the jinxee loses the game, and often a penalty is exacted,\ntypically a punch on the arm.[4]\n\nAn alternative penalty is the individual who initiates the jinx begins\ncounting, and the individual who was jinxed is required to provide a coke for\nevery additional number added to the count, prior to the jinx ending.\n\nIn America, if there are two people that say something at the same time, then\none person can say \"Jinx, you owe me a coke\" The person who says it first gets\na free coke from the other person.\n\nSome variations include 'boundaries', such as no jinxing under a roof or on\ntop of a cloud.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jinx_\\(children%27s_game\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Nuvola_apps_kbackgammon.png/28px-Nuvola_apps_kbackgammon.png)](/wiki/File:Nuvola_apps_kbackgammon.png)[Games portal](/wiki/Portal:Games \"Portal:Games\")\n\n  * [Punch buggy](/wiki/Punch_buggy \"Punch buggy\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jinx_\\(children%27s_game\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Roud, Steve (2010).
