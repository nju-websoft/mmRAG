(She said her heritage was half-Irish.) Her mother\ndied when Tara was nine, and according to ATF Agent Stahl, Tara had a \"drunk\ndaddy\", whom Tara described as a \"bit of a packrat\". Tara was [Jax\nTeller](/wiki/Jax_Teller \"Jax Teller\")'s high-school sweetheart, and during\nthat era she had a crow tattooed on her lower back representing her connection\nto [SAMCRO](/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy_Motorcycle_Club \"Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle\nClub\"). Tara was arrested in Jax's company at least three times in 1996. She\nleft town when Jax was 19, in order to get away from small-town life and the\ninfluence of the club. According to his mother\n[Gemma](/wiki/Gemma_Teller_Morrow \"Gemma Teller Morrow\"), this broke Jax's\nheart.\n\nAfter leaving Charming, Tara moved in with a cousin of her father's, who lived\nin [San Diego](/wiki/San_Diego,_California \"San Diego, California\"), studied\nat [UC San Diego](/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego \"University of\nCalifornia, San Diego\"), and graduated with honors. She then attended medical\nschool in Chicago (either [Feinberg Medical\nSchool](/wiki/Feinberg_Medical_School \"Feinberg Medical School\") at\n[Northwestern University](/wiki/Northwestern_University \"Northwestern\nUniversity\"), according to her file in \"[Fun Town](/wiki/Fun_Town \"Fun\nTown\")\", or \"Loyola Med\" according to [Agent Stahl](/wiki/June_Stahl \"June\nStahl\") in \"[Better Half](/wiki/Better_Half_\\(Sons_of_Anarchy\\) \"Better Half\n\\(Sons of Anarchy\\)\")\") where she was at the top of her class, then she\ncompleted an internship at Chicago Presbyterian.\n\nWhile in Chicago, Tara dated\n[ATF](/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives \"Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\") agent Joshua Kohn, and got\npregnant, and had an abortion at six weeks. Kohn became intimidating, violent,\nand obsessive, so she took out a restraining order against him several months\nbefore she returned to Charming, after an absence of 10 years.\n\n### Season 1[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Season 1\")]\n\nTara works as a Pediatric resident at the local hospital, St. Thomas. It is\nthere that she tends to Jax's gravely ill infant son Abel during Abel's\nhospitalization.\n\nTara lives in her childhood home, which she inherited from her father when he\ndied. She also drives a [Cutlass](/wiki/Oldsmobile_Cutlass \"Oldsmobile\nCutlass\") her father had parked in the garage under \"two tons of old\nnewspapers\".\n\nTara's relationship with Jax upon her return to Charming is based primarily on\ntheir mutual concern for gravely ill Abel. Her psychotic ex-boyfriend Agent\nKohn comes to Charming under the pretext of investigating SAMCRO, but is\nreally there because he wants to resume his relationship with Tara. Afraid for\nher life, Tara seeks Jax's help in driving off Kohn. Jax stabs Kohn's car on\nher behalf, beats him bloody in an altercation at Floyd's barber shop, and\nthen escorts him out of town. When Kohn returns in the dead of night and\nattacks Tara in her home, she shoots him in the gut and calls Jax for help.\n\nWhen Jax arrives he is furious about the attack and shoots Agent Kohn in the\nhead. Tara and Jax then fall into each other's arms and make love while Kohn's\n[iPod](/wiki/IPod \"IPod\") plays the [Andy Williams](/wiki/Andy_Williams \"Andy\nWilliams\") song \"Can't Get Used to Losing You\" on a continuous loop.\n\nFollowing the killing of Kohn, Jax and Tara seem to settle into a largely\nhealthy and positive romantic relationship. Tara spends more time with Jax at\nthe clubhouse, plays nice with Gemma, and works to heal wounded club associate\nCameron Hayes.\n\nThe Jax-Tara relationship soon seems to disintegrate after his ex-wife Wendy\nreturns from rehab. In the penultimate season-one episode \"The Sleep of\nBabies\", Tara is seen sleeping alone while Jax and Wendy make love. In the\nfinal episode of the first season, \"The Revelator\", Tara tells Jax that she\nhas arranged to return to Chicago as she does not believe she is cut out for\nlife in Charming. This angers Jax, and he storms off. At the end of the\nepisode Tara is seen to have changed her mind, and she turns up at Donna's\nfuneral, where she and Jax share a kiss.\n\n### Season 2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Season 2\")]\n\nSeason two shows Tara officially becoming Jax's \"old lady\" and becoming\nintegrated into the club's world. After Gemma is raped, she turns to Tara for\nmedical help. Tara encourages Gemma to seek out counseling to deal with the\npsychological repercussions of the attack but Gemma is reluctant. Tara's help\nwith Gemma combined with her efforts at raising Abel begins to heal the rift\nbetween Tara and Gemma. Tara's connection with Jax and SAMCRO, on the other\nhand, causes problems for her at work. When Gemma accidentally breaks Tara's\nnose after being startled, Margaret Murphy (a hospital administrator) assumes\nthat Jax is responsible and warns Tara about the possible repercussions of\nbeing associated with SAMCRO. Later, Margaret files a \"hostile work\nenvironment\" complaint against Tara after Gemma confronts the administrator\nabout the hospital's desire to move Chibs to another facility because of an\ninsurance issue. Chibs later falsely complains of head pain and is able to\nstay at the hospital. Margaret accuses Tara of coaching Chibs with his\nsymptoms and has Tara's privileges suspended.\n\nWhen Jax decides that he wanted to go nomad, Tara is upset that he made the\ndecision without consulting her. However, unlike everyone else connected to\nthe club, she feels like it might be the right decision given the tension\nbetween Jax and Clay.\n\nGemma lets Tara know that as Jax's \"old lady\", Tara has considerable prestige\nand respect in the club when other women in the club defer to her, and that\nshe shouldn't \"take any shit\" from anyone. Later, Tara confronts Margaret. The\naltercation turns violent and Tara then chokes and punches her. She tells\nMargaret, \"I know where you live, I know where your kids go to school\" and\ninforms her that the cops are on SAMCRO's payroll and that the club runs\nCharming. Tara advises Margaret to keep her mouth shut and retract her\ncomplaint. Margaret immediately agrees.\n\nIn the season two finale, Tara attempts to convince Gemma to not get revenge\non those that raped her, but is unsuccessful. She is present at Jax's home\nwhen Cameron Hayes appears, and is tied to a chair by him before he kidnaps\nAbel Teller. Tara is untied by Jax and tells him what has happened to his son.\nJax and the rest of the club unsuccessfully try to save Abel while Tara is\nlater seen being consoled by Deputy David Hale.\n\n### Season 3[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Season 3\")]\n\nTara is still saddened by the loss of Abel. As time goes by, Jax continues to\npush her away with increasing vehemence. She feels Jax is pushing her away\nbecause he blames her for not preventing Abel's kidnapping. She visits a\nfugitive Gemma and helps her kill Gemma's father's caretaker. Tig helps the\ntwo of them cover it up. Tara later reveals to Gemma that she is six weeks\npregnant.\n\nAfter Jax leaves Tara, she catches him with CaraCara porn star, Ima. Tara then\nstarts packing her things at Jax's house. He apologizes for what she saw\nearlier, but she feels he wanted her to see it, because he wants her gone and\nknew it was the one thing that would drive her away. She expresses that she\nthinks he is doing this because he hates her for what happened to Abel. Jax\nsays that it is to protect her, but Tara doesn't believe him. When Jax goes\nafter her, she is already pulling out of the driveway. As Tara leaves Jax's\nhouse it is shown that the recently ousted Calaveras MC leader, Hector\nSalazar, has been secretly stalking her and Jax.\n\nTara considers having an abortion, as she believes Jax is not ready for\nanother child. Gemma tries to convince Tara to wait until Jax gets back from\nBelfast and look into Abel's eyes before she does anything. Gemma wants Tara\nto try to mend the relationship, because Jax hasn't been thinking clearly\nsince Abel's abduction. Tara ultimately helps Gemma escape police custody so\nGemma can go with Clay and Jax to Belfast.\n\nLyla asks Tara if she knows of any clinics that conduct abortions. When she\ngoes with Lyla to have the procedure, they have a conversation about why Lyla\nis having the abortion. It turns out Lyla is having the same problems with\nOpie. He won't open up to her in fear of what might happen. Lyla also feels\nthe baby is an inconvenience because she wants to continue working as a porn\nstar. After the conversation, Tara schedules an abortion for herself, as well.\nLater, Tara reveals to Margaret Murphy that she is going to have an abortion;\nMargaret agrees it is a good idea and offers to drive Tara to the clinic. On\nthe way, Salazar stages a car accident and abducts Margaret and Tara.\n\nWhile Tara and Margaret are being held by Salazar, he becomes upset when his\nhostage demands aren't met and threatens to kill Margaret. Tara tries to\npersuade him not to and when he doesn't listen to her, she causes a\ndistraction. She attacks Salazar's girlfriend and tries to get away. Salazar\nkicks her hard in the stomach. He goes to kick her a second time but stops\nwhen Tara tells him that she is pregnant.\n\nWhen Tara gets a chance to go to the bathroom, she breaks off a piece of a\nmirror to use as a weapon. When Salazar's girlfriend breaks into the bathroom,\nTara cuts her neck and almost escapes with Margaret, but Salazar stops them.\nAfter a stand off, Tara tells him his girlfriend is in the bathroom bleeding\nbadly. She says she will keep his girlfriend alive if he lets Margaret go.\nWhen Salazar's girlfriend dies in the car, he throws Tara against the car and\nputs a gun to her head.\n\nSalazar takes Tara to Jacob Hale's office, where he takes Hale hostage as\nwell. When he gives his list of demands, one of them is for Jax to come to\nHale's office. Tara sees Salazar pull out a knife, and he tells her he plans\nto kill her while Jax watches and then kill Jax. As Jax enters the office,\nSalazar is about to kill Tara, but Jacob Hale stabs him instead. Jax wrestles\nthe gun from Salazar, gives it to Tara, and tells her to kill anyone who is\nnot a cop. When the whole ordeal is over with Jax and Tara go to the doctor\nfor an ultrasound to make sure the baby was not harmed. The baby is healthy\nand Jax and Tara hear the heartbeat and see the baby on the ultrasound. Jax\nand Tara then go to Gemma's house where Gemma hugs her. Tara sees Abel and\nhappily holds him and welcomes him back home. In the season finale, Tara has\nbecome more involved with the club. She drives Jimmy O back to the garage in\nthe trunk after SAMCRO buys him from the Russians. Jax makes sure that she\nwears a bulletproof vest to ensure her safety in case something goes wrong.\nWhen Stahl tells the club about the deal Jax made with her, which was actually\na trap by the club to kill Stahl and Jimmy, she runs and hugs him distraught\nand fearing that the club will kill him in prison. In the closing minute of\nthe season 3 finale, Tara reads letters from John Teller to his mistress\nMaureen Ashby implying that Gemma and Clay would be responsible for his death\nshould it happen. The close up shot of Tara's face transitions to Jax's face,\nthus ending season 3.\n\n### Between Season 3 and Season\n4[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section:\nBetween Season 3 and Season 4\")]\n\nBridge between end of Season 3 and beginning of Season 4: By the end of season\n3 when Jax and the other Samcro members were hauled off to prison, Tara is a\nlittle over 8 weeks pregnant. However, in a special feature \"appisode\"\n(titled: Tara and Piney)- that took place day 85 of Jax's incarceration; a\npregnant Tara is shown about 5 months along. In this appisode, Tara goes to\n[Piney](/wiki/Piney_Winston \"Piney Winston\") for information on John Teller's\ndeath but is rebuked and told not to investigate further and that the past was\n\"dead and buried\" . In another special \"appisode\" (titled: Second Son) - which\nbridges the gap between seasons; Tara and Gemma visit Jax in prison. Tara has\njust given birth to baby Thomas, and she brings the baby to meet Jax for the\nfirst time. Jax is overjoyed. He apologizes for missing the delivery and\npromises he wouldn't miss anything important ever again.\n\n### Season 4[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Season 4\")]\n\nAt the beginning of Season 4 Tara is waiting to greet Jax on his return home.\nWhen Jax arrives he and Tara spend a little time with Abel and Thomas before\nJax has to go inside the clubhouse for a meeting. When Tara and Jax meet at\ntheir house later, they waste no more time and begin making love. Jax then\nproposes to Tara by putting a ring on their son Thomas's finger. Before Tara\ncan fully accept they have a serious talk about the future of their family.\nJax explains that he is done with SAMCRO, but he has to stay until Clay steps\ndown as president because he and Gemma won't let Jax walk away without\nconflict. He does assure her that as soon as Clay retires and once he has\nsaved enough money to avoid living off his wife he will leave SAMCRO and they\nwill start fresh as a normal family.\n\nLater, at Opie and Lyla's wedding, Jax is the best man and Tara is the maid of\nhonor. The next day Tara and Jax are having breakfast with their sons when\nthey see on the news a story about four dead bodies found at the construction\nsite of Charming Heights. She asks Jax to tell her all he knows about it. He\ntells her it was retaliation for him getting stabbed in prison. Later on she\nencounters Gemma in her office who asks why Tara is not wearing her engagement\nring. Tara simply tells Gemma that she and Jax are just waiting for the right\ntime to tell everyone. Later at the clubhouse a distraught Tara is reunited\nwith Jax after he is rescued from the Russians. There she discovers, along\nwith Jax, that the clubhouse had been trashed by Sheriff Roosevelt. To lighten\nup the mood she decides to announce the engagement.\n\nDuring the season (and before) Tara has become more fearful of the\nconsequences of being involved with SAMCRO and increasingly begins to think\nabout the effect it will have on her son. This leads Tara to make the decision\nof leaving town with her son until things settle down. Tara is also conflicted\nabout the letters from Maureen Ashby. Gemma has found out she has them and\ntries most of the season to obtain them and destroy them. Piney also shows\ninterest in them as a way to blackmail Clay, but Tara keeps them protected.\nClay finds out about the letters and he is so fearful of them getting out,\nthat he takes out a hit on her life from Romeo. Eventually after confronting\nGemma about the letters, Tara admits that she is not capable of showing the\nletters to Jax, feeling that if he knew who his father truly was, Jax would\nget deeper into the club out of guilt, therefore getting him further from her.\n\nTara eventually heads to a medical conference in Oregon and takes Abel and\nThomas with her, most likely for an indefinite stay. Jax accompanies her and\non the way there the assassins hired by Clay try to kill her. Tara survives\nthanks to Jax, however during the fight her right hand gets smashed in a van\ndoor. Her hand is repaired, but the nerves are terribly damaged. Her doctor\naffirms it is unknown if it is permanent but she feels otherwise and believes\nher career to be over. Jax, extremely upset himself, tries to comfort her, but\nTara has become distant and asks him to leave her alone. She feels that now\ntheir future is set and they will never get out of Charming. She's later\nencouraged by Jax that everything will go as they had planned, which Tara\nbarely believes.\n\nDuring the day she's visited by Jax's ex-wife Wendy, who makes it clear that\nshe wants to know Abel better, as she gave up custody but not the right to\nknow him. This unnerves Tara who feels she is Abel's true mother and becomes\nfearful that Wendy will take him away from her. Wendy leaves her number and\nTara smashes the vase of flowers, screaming in anger. She's later put under\npsych watch and restrained to her bed. Jax begins to feel at a loss as how to\ntake care of and comfort her.\n\nLater Gemma comes to see her and confesses that it was Clay who wanted her\ndead because of the letters, which she gives to Gemma. She reveals later to\nGemma that she was fully aware of her plan to have Clay killed by Jax and hide\nthe letters that involve her and Unser, to prompt Jax to stay as President.\nTara gives Jax a blood thinner to inject into Clay, who is recuperating at St.\nThomas. She then tells Jax, in front of Gemma, that he will kill Clay and come\nget her and the boys, so they can leave Charming forever. This plan fails as\nJax is forced to stay due to the influence of Romeo Parada and Luis Torres who\nare undercover CIA agents. They need SAMCRO to provide weapons and transport\ndrugs or they will crush the club. Understanding that Jax has to become\nPresident, Tara decides to remain with him. In the season finale, with Gemma\nwatching Tara stands behind Jax at the head of the table, one arm draped\naround him, mirroring a photo of Gemma and John Teller.\n\n### Season 5[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Season 5\")]\n\nThe season begins with Tara's hand in a cast unable to perform surgeries.\nDespite losing ability to operate, she supports Jax as President of SAMCRO.\nThe couple lacks certainty of \"where it all goes,\" but Jax is clear that \"no\nmatter what happens, I want you to be my wife.\" Tara mocks the romanticism of\na spontaneous wedding at Diosa to which Jax jokes, \"I killed a Fed for you ...\nnothing says endless love like capital murder.\" A judge marries them in a\nquick ceremony with wedding rings that belonged to Gemma and JT. Tension rises\nbetween Tara and Gemma over controlling the family. Tara places Abel and\nThomas in hospital daycare with Jax's support. Tara gains power by shutting\nout Gemma, who is not on visitor list at first. Gemma tries to hurt Tara by\nusing Wendy to threaten a custody suit. Tara stands firm by warning Gemma not\nto hurt her or her family or Jax \"might kill you.\" Tara strategically plans\nsquashing RICO case with Lowen, Bobby and Jax. She volunteers at Stockton\nState Prison and asks Otto to recant his RICO statement.\n\nTara extends an olive branch to Gemma by placing her on daycare visitor's list\nand allowing her to watch the boys. Gemma is stoned when she wrecks her car\nwith Abel and Thomas in the backseat. Tara punches Gemma when she confesses to\nbeing high while driving with the boys. Tara's fears intensify over the\nincreasing threats to her family; she starts to defend and protect them in\nGemma-like ways. Tara cuts her out of the family, but agrees to let Gemma back\nin if she helps Jax with getting intel from Clay on plot to undermine his\nleadership. Tara receives good prognosis for her hand and gets recruited for a\nsurgical job in Oregon. Meanwhile, Otto agrees to Tara's plea on RICO if she\nwill bring him Luann's crucifix.\n\nTara's career is on the line when she is investigated as an accessory to\nOtto's brutal murder of a prison nurse that was killed with Luann's crucifix.\nJax assures Tara that they will get through the investigation just like they\nget through everything else to which she quips, \"that's what scares me.\" She\nbecomes guarded when Jax doesn't walk away after meeting his goal to save the\nMC with RICO shutdown. She is pressed to reply to the offer and internally\nstruggles with moving on as it is the \"last chance\" for her and Jax to get out\nof Charming. While meeting to prepare Tara's defense, Lowen prompts Tara to\nthink about legal custody of sons if anything was to happen to her. Tara\nagrees to [Providence Health & Services](/wiki/Providence_Health_%26_Services\n\"Providence Health & Services\") job offer before telling Jax.\n\nWendy confronts Tara with reality of risk associated with MC and shows her the\nshoulder bruise from the force of Jax jamming a speedball needle into it. Tara\ngasps with shock realizing that Jax is losing his way. The prison nurse's\nbrother, Lee Toric, confronts Tara at the hospital and threatens to avenge her\ndeath. More than ever, Tara needs someone trustworthy to name as guardian of\nher sons in case of imprisonment or death. Tara has no permanent nerve damage\nand will be able to operate again. Tara requests clarity from Jax who does not\ncome clean about intimidating Wendy.\n\nGemma confronts Tara about [Providence Health &\nServices](/wiki/Providence_Health_%26_Services \"Providence Health & Services\")\noffer and threatens Tara \"I'm done with your power push.\" Gemma threatens to\ntell investigators that Tara planned the killing of an innocent nurse to\nreverse RICO. Tara enlists Wendy as guardian and is now more determined to\npull her sons out of Charming's \"cesspool.\" Jax disapproves of Wendy as\nGuardian, but Tara insists it is her 'job as an old lady to be strong ... when\nand where [he] can't be.\" She tells him she accepted a job offer in Oregon to\nspare them from becoming like Gemma and Clay, which will force the boys to\nrelive their mistakes.\n\nThe season ends with Tara's arrest for conspiracy to commit Pamela Toric's\nmurder.\n\n### Season 6[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Season 6\")]\n\nAfter a season of failed attempts to get herself and her sons out of Charming\n(including a false pregnancy and subsequently faked miscarriage to bar Gemma\nTeller-Morrow from gaining custody of Abel and Thomas, should Tara go to\nprison), and after Tara and Jax's relationship was tested (Tara and Jax are\nhaving problems with her being behind bars for her involvement in the death of\na nurse. Jax is seen at the end of episode 1 cheating on Tara with Colette\nJane, an escort handler) Tara finds herself at odds with everyone she was\nsupposed to be able to trust and chooses to use the bullet she pulled from\nBobby Munson's shoulder as evidence necessary to grant her witness protection,\nin turn making her a rat and a liability to the MC and to Jax himself. In a\nlast-minute plot twist, Jax finds Tara at a park in Lodi. They talk for\nseveral minutes and then the scene cuts to the motel room Tara had been hiding\nin. The two come to an understanding and Jax surrenders himself to the mercy\nof DA Tyne Patterson in exchange for Tara's immunity for all the crimes she\ncommitted on behalf the MC, specifically that of the murder of Pamela Toric,\nfor which she was accused in season 5 but did not have anything to do with.\nThe DA agrees to what Jax offers her after a few moments of reluctance to\nbelieve that he will come through. With that, Jax has let Tara know that he\ntruly loves her and their sons more than anything. They cry and make love.\nTara and Jax agree to meet the DA at the Teller home at 6pm after he spends\nhis last hours as a free man with his sons. He tells Chibs and Bobby he will\nmost likely be sentenced to 25 years, with parole in 10, 7 if he's lucky. Tara\ngets home earlier than expected and the house is empty, save for Eli, the\nsheriff, who entered the house with her so they could talk in private and he\ncould help her bring her suitcases into the house, as she decided not to run\naway and do what Jax asked of her; raise their sons.\n\nWhen Eli leaves, stating he'll be outside, Tara calls for Wayne, assuming his\ntruck outside meant he was in the house. Caught off guard, Gemma comes out of\nthe laundry room and lunges for Tara, who cannot escape in time. Gemma hits\nher with an iron but doesn't knock her out. Tara struggles against Gemma's\nbeating and her head is badly smashed on the sink, where Gemma then attempts\nto drown her. In one of the show's most gruesome moments, Tara struggles for\nseveral seconds before Gemma grabs a barbecue fork and stabs Tara multiple\ntimes in the back of the head and her neck. Blood gushing out of the back of\nher head, Tara collapses and dies.\n\nLt. Roosevelt walks in on the scene and discovers Gemma sitting on the floor\nnext to Tara's body, in obvious shock. Gemma is mumbling incoherently about\nhow it had to be done because she was going to rat out the MC. Roosevelt tells\nher she didn't rat out the MC, and that Jax is giving himself up to protect\nher. Immediately after this, Juice walks in, sees the scene, shoots Lt.\nRoosevelt twice in the back and then comforts Gemma. After this he begins\ncleaning up the murder scene. Jax returns home later that evening. He sees Lt.\nRoosevelt's legs on the kitchen floor, draws his gun, and then enters the\nkitchen, where he finds both Eli and Tara dead on the floor. Stunned, he drops\nhis gun at Eli's feet and cradles Tara in his arms.\n\n## Critical\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Critical response\")]\n\n_The New York Times_ ' series-premiere review remarked on the \"chemistry\"\nbetween Jax and Tara, and described the character as \"beautiful...refined and\nbook-smart.\"[1]\n\nTV Squad credited Siff with a \"superior performance\"[2] and the _Chicago\nTribune_ described her as \"excellent.\"[3]\n\n## Related links[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Related links\")]\n\n  * [List of _Sons of Anarchy_ characters](/wiki/List_of_Sons_of_Anarchy_characters \"List of Sons of Anarchy characters\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tara_Knowles&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Bellafante, Ginia](/wiki/Ginia_Bellafante \"Ginia Bellafante\") (2008-09-03).
