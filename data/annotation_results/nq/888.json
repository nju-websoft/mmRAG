Gottfried was also the\nvoice of the [Aflac Duck](/wiki/Aflac_Duck \"Aflac Duck\") until 2011.\n\nSince 2014, Gottfried has hosted a [podcast](/wiki/Podcast \"Podcast\") titled\n_Gilbert Gottfried 's Amazing Colossal Podcast_, which airs new episodes each\nweek featuring discussions of classic movies and celebrity interviews, most\noften with veteran actors, comedians and comedy writers.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Career\n    * 1.1 Early career (1970–1998)\n    * 1.2 Voice acting, television and films (1999–present)\n  * 2 Personal life\n  * 3 Comedic style\n  * 4 Controversial jokes\n    * 4.1 1991 Emmy Awards\n    * 4.2 September 11 joke\n    * 4.3 Japanese tsunami jokes\n  * 5 Filmography\n    * 5.1 Movies\n    * 5.2 Television\n    * 5.3 Video games\n    * 5.4 Commercials\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n##\nCareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gilbert_Gottfried&action=edit&section=1&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Career\")]\n\n### Early career\n(1970–1998)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gilbert_Gottfried&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Early career \\(1970–1998\\)\")]\n\nAt age 15, Gottfried began doing amateur stand-up in [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") and, after a few years, became\nknown around New York as \"the comedian's comedian.\"[3] In 1980, _[Saturday\nNight Live](/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live \"Saturday Night Live\")_ was being\nretooled with a new staff and new comedians; the producers noticed Gottfried\nand hired him as a cast member for [season\n6](/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_\\(season_6\\) \"Saturday Night Live \\(season\n6\\)\").[4] Gottfried's [persona](/wiki/Persona \"Persona\") in _SNL_ sketches was\nvery different from his later characterization: he rarely (if ever) spoke in\nhis trademark screeching, obnoxious voice and never squinted. During his\n12-episode stint, he was given very little airtime and seldom used in\nsketches. Gottfried recalls a low point was having to play a corpse in a\nsketch about a sports organist hired to play inappropriate music at a funeral.\nDespite this, he had one recurring character (Leo Waxman, husband to [Denny\nDillon](/wiki/Denny_Dillon \"Denny Dillon\")'s Pinky Waxman on the recurring\ntalk show sketch, \"What's It All About?\") and two celebrity impersonations:\n[David A. Stockman](/wiki/David_A._Stockman \"David A. Stockman\") and\ncontroversial film director [Roman Polanski](/wiki/Roman_Polanski \"Roman\nPolanski\").[5]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/GilbertGottfried.jpg)](/wiki/File:GilbertGottfried.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GilbertGottfried.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGottfried at the 1991 Emmy Awards\n\nGottfried also played accountant Sidney Bernstein in the 1987 film _[Beverly\nHills Cop II](/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop_II \"Beverly Hills Cop II\")_.\n\nAlthough not a regular, he also appeared in _[The Amazing Live Sea\nMonkeys](/wiki/The_Amazing_Live_Sea_Monkeys \"The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys\")_ ,\nas well as voicing the crazed dentist Dr. Bender and his son Wendell in _[The\nFairly OddParents](/wiki/The_Fairly_OddParents \"The Fairly OddParents\")_ and\nthe voice of Jerry the Belly Button Elf on _[Ren and\nStimpy](/wiki/Ren_and_Stimpy \"Ren and Stimpy\")_. Three of his most prominent\nroles came in 1990, 1991, and 1992, when he was cast as the adoption agent\n[Igor Peabody](/wiki/Problem_Child_\\(film\\)#Cast \"Problem Child \\(film\\)\") in\n_[Problem Child](/wiki/Problem_Child_\\(film\\) \"Problem Child \\(film\\)\")_ and\n_[Problem Child 2](/wiki/Problem_Child_2 \"Problem Child 2\")_ and the parrot\n[Iago](/wiki/Iago_\\(Aladdin\\)#Iago \"Iago \\(Aladdin\\)\") in\n_[Aladdin](/wiki/Aladdin_\\(1992_Disney_film\\) \"Aladdin \\(1992 Disney\nfilm\\)\")_. When asked how he prepared for the role, Gottfried said, \"I did the\nwhole [DeNiro](/wiki/Robert_De_Niro \"Robert De Niro\") thing. I moved to [South\nAmerica](/wiki/South_America \"South America\")! I lived in the trees!\"\nGottfried reprised the role in _[Aladdin: The Return of\nJafar](/wiki/Aladdin:_The_Return_of_Jafar \"Aladdin: The Return of Jafar\")_ ,\n_[Aladdin and the King of Thieves](/wiki/Aladdin_and_the_King_of_Thieves\n\"Aladdin and the King of Thieves\")_ , the [television\nseries](/wiki/Aladdin_\\(TV_series\\) \"Aladdin \\(TV series\\)\") and various\nrelated media, such as _[Kingdom Hearts](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts \"Kingdom\nHearts\")_ and _[House of Mouse](/wiki/Disney%27s_House_of_Mouse \"Disney's\nHouse of Mouse\")_. Gottfried also voiced Berkely Beetle in 1994's Thumbelina.\n\nIn 1996, he starred as a talking smoke detector, in \"Be Cool about Fire\nSafety,\" a short fire safety video for younger audiences.\n\nGottfried was the host of the Saturday edition of _[USA Up All\nNight](/wiki/USA_Up_All_Night \"USA Up All Night\")_ for its entire run from\n1989 to 1998.\n\n### Voice acting, television and films\n(1999–present)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gilbert_Gottfried&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Voice acting, television and films \\(1999–present\\)\")]\n\nOn the most recent version of _[Hollywood Squares](/wiki/Hollywood_Squares\n\"Hollywood Squares\")_ , Gottfried was a regular guest. On one particular\nepisode, he was the last square on the board for a five-square win, but both\ncontestants repeatedly got his answers wrong, prompting Gottfried to yell \"YOU\nFOOL!\" with every incorrect response. It took seven tries before a contestant\nfinally correctly agreed with him, specifically on a question of \"smog\" being\na combination of smoke and fog.\n\nGottfried has provided the voice of the duck in the [Aflac](/wiki/Aflac\n\"Aflac\") commercials and [Digit](/wiki/Digit_\\(Cyberchase\\) \"Digit\n\\(Cyberchase\\)\") in _[Cyberchase](/wiki/Cyberchase \"Cyberchase\")_ , as well as\n[Mr. Mxyzptlk](/wiki/Mr._Mxyzptlk \"Mr. Mxyzptlk\") in _[Superman: The Animated\nSeries](/wiki/Superman:_The_Animated_Series \"Superman: The Animated Series\")_.\nHe also voiced a nasty wisecracking criminal genius named Nick-Nack in two\nepisodes of _[Superboy](/wiki/Superboy_\\(TV_series\\) \"Superboy \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ (he also co-wrote an issue of _[Superboy: The Comic\nBook](/wiki/Superboy:_The_Comic_Book \"Superboy: The Comic Book\")_ , which\nfeatured Nick-Nack's origin). On _[The Tonight Show with Jay\nLeno](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\")_\n, Gottfried has made regular appearances.\n\nIn 2004, [Comedy Central](/wiki/Comedy_Central \"Comedy Central\") featured\nGottfried's stand-up material for _[Shorties Watchin'\nShorties](/wiki/Shorties_Watchin%27_Shorties \"Shorties Watchin'\nShorties\")_.[6] Gottfried was part of an online advertising campaign for\n[Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\")'s [Office XP](/wiki/Office_XP \"Office\nXP\") [software](/wiki/Software \"Software\"), showing, in a series of [Flash-\nanimated](/wiki/Flash-animated \"Flash-animated\") [cartoons](/wiki/Cartoon\n\"Cartoon\"), that the [Clippy](/wiki/Clippy \"Clippy\") office assistant would be\nremoved.

He also\nguest-starred in _[The Grim Adventures of Billy and\nMandy](/wiki/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy \"The Grim Adventures of\nBilly and Mandy\")_ as [Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus \"Santa Claus\") in the\none-hour Christmas Special.

You laugh at the setup. You laugh at his\ncomments about the joke. You even laugh at the segues between his jokes.\"[15]\nGottfried is known for speaking in a loud and grating voice, which is not his\nnatural speaking voice.[16] Mark Binneli of _[Rolling\nStone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ described Gottfried as a\n\"squinting, squawking mass of contradictions\", noting his status as \"one of\nAmerica's filthiest stand-ups and one of the most successful voice-over\nartists in children's entertainment.\"[17] Gottfried is known for joking about\nrecent tragedies. In a July 2012 [op-ed](/wiki/Op-ed \"Op-ed\") for\n[CNN](/wiki/CNN \"CNN\"), he wrote: \"I have always felt comedy and tragedy are\nroommates. If you look up comedy and tragedy, you will find a very old picture\nof two masks. One mask is tragedy. It looks like it's crying. The other mask\nis comedy. It looks like it's laughing. Nowadays, we would say, 'How tasteless\nand insensitive. A comedy mask is laughing at a tragedy mask.'\"[18]\n\n## Controversial\njokes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gilbert_Gottfried&action=edit&section=6&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Controversial jokes\")]\n\n### 1991 Emmy\nAwards[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gilbert_Gottfried&action=edit&section=7&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: 1991 Emmy Awards\")]\n\nAt the [43rd Primetime Emmy Awards](/wiki/43rd_Primetime_Emmy_Awards \"43rd\nPrimetime Emmy Awards\"), Gottfried made \"an endless series of masturbation\njokes\" in reference to [Paul Reubens](/wiki/Paul_Reubens \"Paul Reubens\")'\narrest for masturbating in an adult movie theater.[19] Viewers on the east\ncoast saw the entire set live, but Fox censored the broadcast for the west\ncoast delay.[20] Fox issued an apology, stating that Gottfried's jokes were\n\"irresponsible and insulting\".[19] Gottfried said that producers stated he\nwould not be invited back,[21] and _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone\n\"Rolling Stone\")_ wrote that the monologue resulted in him being\n\"blacklisted\".[17]\n\n### September 11\njoke[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gilbert_Gottfried&action=edit&section=8&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: September 11 joke\")]\n\nDuring his monologue at a [Friars Club](/wiki/New_York_Friars%27_Club \"New\nYork Friars' Club\") [roast](/wiki/Roast_\\(comedy\\) \"Roast \\(comedy\\)\") of\n[Hugh Hefner](/wiki/Hugh_Hefner \"Hugh Hefner\") three weeks after the\n[September 11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks \"September 11 attacks\"),\nGottfried joked that he had intended to catch a plane, but could not get a\ndirect flight because \"they said they have to stop at the [Empire State\nBuilding](/wiki/Empire_State_Building \"Empire State Building\") first\". This\nwas one of the first public examples of [9/11 humor](/wiki/9/11_humor \"9/11\nhumor\"). Audience members responded with hisses and a cry of \"Too soon!\"\nGottfried then abandoned his prepared remarks and launched into the venerable\n[Aristocrats joke](/wiki/The_Aristocrats_\\(joke\\) \"The Aristocrats \\(joke\\)\"),\nwinning back the audience.[22] [Penn Jillette](/wiki/Penn_Jillette \"Penn\nJillette\") and [Paul Provenza](/wiki/Paul_Provenza \"Paul Provenza\") used\nGottfried's
