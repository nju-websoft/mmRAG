It is often stated as \"DNA\nmakes RNA and RNA makes protein,\"[1] although this is an oversimplification.\nIt was first stated by [Francis Crick](/wiki/Francis_Crick \"Francis Crick\") in\n1958:[2]\n\n“ | The Central Dogma. This states that once 'information' has passed into [protein](/wiki/Protein \"Protein\") it cannot get out again. In more detail, the transfer of information from [nucleic acid](/wiki/Nucleic_acid \"Nucleic acid\") to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid to protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or from protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information means here the precise determination of sequence, either of bases in the nucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein. | ”  \n---|---|---  \n— Francis Crick, 1958  \n  \nand re-stated in a _[Nature](/wiki/Nature_\\(journal\\) \"Nature \\(journal\\)\")_\npaper published in 1970:[3]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Centraldogma_nodetails.png/160px-\nCentraldogma_nodetails.png)](/wiki/File:Centraldogma_nodetails.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Centraldogma_nodetails.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nInformation flow in biological systems\n\n“ | The central dogma of [molecular biology](/wiki/Molecular_biology \"Molecular biology\") deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of [sequential information](/wiki/DNA_sequencing \"DNA sequencing\"). It states that such information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid. | ”  \n---|---|---  \n— Francis Crick  \n  \nA second version of the central dogma is popular but incorrect. This is the\nsimplistic DNA → RNA → protein pathway published by [James\nWatson](/wiki/James_Watson \"James Watson\") in the first edition of _The\nMolecular Biology of the Gene_ (1965). Watson's version differs from Crick's\nbecause Watson describes the two-step (DNA → RNA and RNA → protein) pathway as\nthe central dogma.[4] While the dogma, as originally stated by Crick, remains\nvalid today, Watson's version does not.\n\nThe dogma is a framework for understanding the transfer of\n[sequence](/wiki/Sequence \"Sequence\") [information](/wiki/Information\n\"Information\") between information-carrying [biopolymers](/wiki/Biopolymer\n\"Biopolymer\"), in the most common or general case, in living\n[organisms](/wiki/Organism \"Organism\"). There are 3 major classes of such\nbiopolymers: [DNA](/wiki/DNA \"DNA\") and [RNA](/wiki/RNA \"RNA\") (both nucleic\nacids), and [protein](/wiki/Protein \"Protein\"). There are 3×3=9 conceivable\ndirect transfers of information that can occur between these. The dogma\nclasses these into 3 groups of 3: three general transfers (believed to occur\nnormally in most cells), three special transfers (known to occur, but only\nunder specific conditions in case of some viruses or in a laboratory), and\nthree unknown transfers (believed never to occur). The general transfers\ndescribe the normal flow of biological information: DNA can be copied to DNA\n([DNA replication](/wiki/DNA_replication \"DNA replication\")), DNA information\ncan be copied into [mRNA](/wiki/MRNA \"MRNA\")\n([transcription](/wiki/Transcription_\\(genetics\\) \"Transcription\n\\(genetics\\)\")), and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA\nas a template ([translation](/wiki/Translation_\\(genetics\\) \"Translation\n\\(genetics\\)\")). The special transfers describe: RNA being copied from RNA\n([RNA replication](/wiki/RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase \"RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerase\")), DNA being synthesised using an RNA template ([reverse\ntranscription](/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase \"Reverse transcriptase\")), and\nproteins being synthesised directly from a DNA template without the use of\n[mRNA](/wiki/Messenger_RNA \"Messenger RNA\"). The unknown transfers describe: a\nprotein being copied from a protein, synthesis of RNA using the [primary\nstructure](/wiki/Protein_primary_structure \"Protein primary structure\") of a\nprotein as a template, and DNA synthesis using the primary structure of a\nprotein as a template - these are not thought to naturally occur.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Biological sequence information\n  * 2 General transfers of biological sequential information\n    * 2.1 DNA replications\n    * 2.2 Transcription\n    * 2.3 Translation\n  * 3 Special transfers of biological sequential information\n    * 3.1 Reverse transcription\n    * 3.2 RNA replication\n    * 3.3 Direct translation from DNA to protein\n  * 4 Transfers of information not explicitly covered in the theory\n    * 4.1 Posttranslational modification\n    * 4.2 Inteins\n    * 4.3 Methylation\n    * 4.4 Prions\n    * 4.5 Natural genetic engineering\n  * 5 Use of the term \"dogma\"\n  * 6 Comparison with the Weismann barrier\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 Further reading\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Biological sequence\ninformation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Biological sequence information\")]\n\nMain article: [Primary structure](/wiki/Primary_structure \"Primary structure\")\n\nThe [biopolymers](/wiki/Biopolymer \"Biopolymer\") that comprise DNA, RNA and\n(poly)[peptides](/wiki/Peptide \"Peptide\") are linear polymers (i.e.: each\nmonomer is connected to at most two other monomers).

A complex group of proteins called the\n[replisome](/wiki/Replisome \"Replisome\") performs the replication of the\ninformation from the parent strand to the complementary daughter strand.\n\nThe replisome comprises:\n\n  * a [helicase](/wiki/Helicase \"Helicase\") that unwinds the [superhelix](/wiki/Superhelix \"Superhelix\") as well as the [double-stranded DNA helix](/wiki/Nucleic_acid_double_helix \"Nucleic acid double helix\") to create a [replication fork](/wiki/Replication_fork \"Replication fork\")\n  * [SSB protein](/wiki/SSB_protein \"SSB protein\") that binds open the double-stranded DNA to prevent it from reassociating\n  * [RNA primase](/w/index.php?title=RNA_primase&action=edit&redlink=1 \"RNA primase \\(page does not exist\\)\") that adds a complementary RNA primer to each template strand as a starting point for replication\n  * [DNA polymerase III](/wiki/DNA_polymerase_III \"DNA polymerase III\") that reads the existing template chain from its 3' end to its 5' end and adds new complementary nucleotides from the 5' end to the 3' end of the daughter chain\n  * [DNA polymerase I](/wiki/DNA_polymerase_I \"DNA polymerase I\") that removes the RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.\n  * [DNA ligase](/wiki/DNA_ligase \"DNA ligase\") that joins the two [Okazaki fragments](/wiki/Okazaki_fragments \"Okazaki fragments\") with [phosphodiester bonds](/wiki/Phosphodiester_bonds \"Phosphodiester bonds\") to produce a continuous chain.\n\nThis process typically takes place during [S phase](/wiki/S_phase \"S phase\")\nof the [cell cycle](/wiki/Cell_cycle \"Cell cycle\").\n\n###\nTranscription[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Transcription\")]\n\n[![Central Dogma of Molecular Biochemistry with\nEnzymes.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg/256px-\nCentral_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg)](/wiki/File:Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nMain article: [Transcription (genetics)](/wiki/Transcription_\\(genetics\\)\n\"Transcription \\(genetics\\)\")\n\nTranscription is the process by which the information contained in a section\nof DNA is replicated in the form of a newly assembled piece of [messenger\nRNA](/wiki/Messenger_RNA \"Messenger RNA\") (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the\nprocess include [RNA polymerase](/wiki/RNA_polymerase \"RNA polymerase\") and\n[transcription factors](/wiki/Transcription_factor \"Transcription factor\"). In\n[eukaryotic](/wiki/Eukaryote \"Eukaryote\") cells the primary transcript is\n[pre-mRNA](/wiki/Precursor_mRNA \"Precursor mRNA\"). Pre-mRNA must be\n[processed](/wiki/Post-transcriptional_modification \"Post-transcriptional\nmodification\") for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of\na [5' cap](/wiki/5%27_cap \"5' cap\") and a [poly-A tail](/wiki/Polyadenylation\n\"Polyadenylation\") to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by\n[splicing](/wiki/RNA_splicing \"RNA splicing\"). [Alternative\nsplicing](/wiki/Alternative_splicing \"Alternative splicing\") occurs when\nappropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can\nproduce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the\nproduction of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.\n\n###\nTranslation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Translation\")]\n\nMain article: [Translation (genetics)](/wiki/Translation_\\(genetics\\)\n\"Translation \\(genetics\\)\")\n\nThe mature mRNA finds its way to a [ribosome](/wiki/Ribosome \"Ribosome\"),\nwhere it gets [translated](/wiki/Translation_\\(genetics\\) \"Translation\n\\(genetics\\)\"). In [prokaryotic](/wiki/Prokaryotic \"Prokaryotic\") cells, which\nhave no nuclear compartment, the processes of transcription and translation\nmay be linked together without clear separation. In\n[eukaryotic](/wiki/Eukaryotic \"Eukaryotic\") cells, the site of transcription\n(the [cell nucleus](/wiki/Cell_nucleus \"Cell nucleus\")) is usually separated\nfrom the site of translation (the [cytoplasm](/wiki/Cytoplasm \"Cytoplasm\")),\nso the mRNA must be transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where\nit can be bound by ribosomes. The ribosome reads the mRNA triplet\n[codons](/wiki/Genetic_code \"Genetic code\"), usually beginning with an AUG\n([adenine](/wiki/Adenine \"Adenine\")−[uracil](/wiki/Uracil\n\"Uracil\")−[guanine](/wiki/Guanine \"Guanine\")), or initiator\n[methionine](/wiki/Methionine \"Methionine\") codon downstream of the\n[ribosome](/wiki/Ribosome \"Ribosome\") binding site. Complexes of [initiation\nfactors](/wiki/Initiation_factor \"Initiation factor\") and [elongation\nfactors](/wiki/Elongation_factor \"Elongation factor\") bring\n[aminoacylated](/wiki/Aminoacylation \"Aminoacylation\") [transfer\nRNAs](/wiki/Transfer_RNA \"Transfer RNA\") (tRNAs) into the ribosome-mRNA\ncomplex, matching the codon in the mRNA to the anti-codon on the tRNA. Each\ntRNA bears the appropriate [amino acid](/wiki/Amino_acid \"Amino acid\") residue\nto add to the [polypeptide](/wiki/Peptide \"Peptide\") chain being synthesised.\nAs the amino acids get linked into the growing peptide chain, the chain begins\nfolding into the correct conformation. Translation ends with a [stop\ncodon](/wiki/Stop_codon \"Stop codon\") which may be a UAA, UGA, or UAG triplet.\n\nThe mRNA does not contain all the information for specifying the nature of the\nmature protein. The nascent polypeptide chain released from the ribosome\ncommonly requires additional processing before the final product emerges. For\none thing, the correct folding process is complex and vitally important. For\nmost proteins it requires other [chaperone proteins](/wiki/Chaperone_protein\n\"Chaperone protein\") to control the form of the product. Some proteins then\nexcise internal segments from their own peptide chains, splicing the free ends\nthat border the gap; in such processes the inside \"discarded\" sections are\ncalled [inteins](/wiki/Intein \"Intein\"). Other proteins must be split into\nmultiple sections without splicing. Some polypeptide chains need to be cross-\nlinked, and others must be attached to\n[cofactors](/wiki/Cofactor_\\(biochemistry\\) \"Cofactor \\(biochemistry\\)\") such\nas haem (heme) before they become functional.\n\n## Special transfers of biological sequential\ninformation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Special transfers of biological sequential information\")]\n\n### Reverse\ntranscription[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Reverse transcription\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Extended_Central_Dogma_with_Enzymes.jpg/550px-\nExtended_Central_Dogma_with_Enzymes.jpg)](/wiki/File:Extended_Central_Dogma_with_Enzymes.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Extended_Central_Dogma_with_Enzymes.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUnusual flows of information highlighted in green\n\n  \n\nMain article: [Reverse transcription](/wiki/Reverse_transcription \"Reverse\ntranscription\")\n\nReverse transcription is the transfer of information from RNA to DNA (the\nreverse of normal transcription). This is known to occur in the case of\n[retroviruses](/wiki/Retrovirus \"Retrovirus\"), such as [HIV](/wiki/HIV \"HIV\"),\nas well as in [eukaryotes](/wiki/Eukaryote \"Eukaryote\"), in the case of\n[retrotransposons](/wiki/Retrotransposon \"Retrotransposon\") and\n[telomere](/wiki/Telomere \"Telomere\") synthesis. It is the process by which\ngenetic information from RNA gets transcribed into new DNA.\n\n### RNA\nreplication[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: RNA replication\")]\n\nRNA replication is the copying of one RNA to another. Many viruses replicate\nthis way. The enzymes that copy RNA to new RNA, called [RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerases](/wiki/RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase \"RNA-dependent RNA\npolymerase\"), are also found in many eukaryotes where they are involved in\n[RNA silencing](/wiki/RNA_silencing \"RNA silencing\").[5]\n\n[RNA editing](/wiki/RNA_editing \"RNA editing\"), in which an RNA sequence is\naltered by a complex of proteins and a \"guide RNA\", could also be seen as an\nRNA-to-RNA transfer.\n\n### Direct translation from DNA to\nprotein[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Direct translation from DNA to protein\")]\n\nDirect translation from DNA to protein has been demonstrated in a cell-free\nsystem (i.e. in a test tube), using extracts from _[E.\ncoli](/wiki/Escherichia_coli \"Escherichia coli\")_ that contained ribosomes,\nbut not intact cells. These cell fragments could synthesize proteins from\nsingle-stranded DNA templates isolated from other organisms (e,g., mouse or\ntoad), and [neomycin](/wiki/Neomycin \"Neomycin\") was found to enhance this\neffect. However, it was unclear whether this mechanism of translation\ncorresponded specifically to the genetic code.[6][7]\n\n## Transfers of information not explicitly covered in the\ntheory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Transfers of information not explicitly covered in the\ntheory\")]\n\n### Posttranslational\nmodification[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Posttranslational modification\")]\n\nMain article: [Post-translational modification](/wiki/Post-\ntranslational_modification \"Post-translational modification\")\n\nAfter protein amino acid sequences have been translated from nucleic acid\nchains, they can be edited by appropriate enzymes. Although this is a form of\nprotein affecting protein sequence, not explicitly covered by the central\ndogma, there are not many clear examples where the associated concepts of the\ntwo fields have much to do with each other.\n\n###\nInteins[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Inteins\")]\n\nMain article: [Intein](/wiki/Intein \"Intein\")\n\nAn intein is a \"parasitic\" segment of a protein that is able to excise itself\nfrom the chain of amino acids as they emerge from the ribosome and rejoin the\nremaining portions with a peptide bond in such a manner that the main protein\n\"backbone\" does not fall apart. This is a case of a protein changing its own\nprimary sequence from the sequence originally encoded by the DNA of a gene.\nAdditionally, most inteins contain a [homing\nendonuclease](/wiki/Homing_endonuclease \"Homing endonuclease\") or HEG domain\nwhich is capable of finding a copy of the parent gene that does not include\nthe intein nucleotide sequence. On contact with the intein-free copy, the HEG\ndomain initiates the [DNA double-stranded break\nrepair](/wiki/DNA_repair#Double-strand_breaks \"DNA repair\") mechanism. This\nprocess causes the intein sequence to be copied from the original source gene\nto the intein-free gene. This is an example of protein directly editing DNA\nsequence, as well as increasing the sequence's heritable propagation.\n\n###\nMethylation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Methylation\")]\n\nMain article: [Epigenetics](/wiki/Epigenetics \"Epigenetics\")\n\nVariation in [methylation](/wiki/DNA_methylation \"DNA methylation\") states of\nDNA can alter [gene expression](/wiki/Gene_expression \"Gene expression\")\nlevels significantly. Methylation variation usually occurs through the action\nof DNA [methylases](/wiki/Methylase \"Methylase\"). When the change is\nheritable, it is considered [epigenetic](/wiki/Epigenetic \"Epigenetic\"). When\nthe change in information status is not heritable, it would be a [somatic\nepitype](/wiki/Somatic_epitype \"Somatic epitype\"). The effective information\ncontent has been changed by means of the actions of a protein or proteins on\nDNA, but the primary DNA sequence is not altered.\n\n###\nPrions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Prions\")]\n\nMain article: [Prion](/wiki/Prion \"Prion\")\n\n[Prions](/wiki/Prion \"Prion\") are proteins of particular amino acid sequences\nin particular conformations. They propagate themselves in host cells by making\n[conformational\nchanges](/wiki/Protein_conformation#Levels_of_protein_structure \"Protein\nconformation\") in other molecules of protein with the same amino acid\nsequence, but with a different conformation that is functionally important or\ndetrimental to the organism. Once the protein has been transconformed to the\nprion folding it changes function. In turn it can convey information into new\ncells and reconfigure more functional molecules of that sequence into the\nalternate prion form. In some types of prion in [fungi](/wiki/Fungi \"Fungi\")\nthis change is continuous and direct; the information flow is Protein →\nProtein.\n\nSome scientists such as [Alain E.\nBussard](/w/index.php?title=Alain_E._Bussard&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Alain E.\nBussard \\(page does not exist\\)\") and [Eugene Koonin](/wiki/Eugene_Koonin\n\"Eugene Koonin\") have argued that prion-mediated inheritance violates the\ncentral dogma of molecular biology.[8][9] However, [Rosalind\nRidley](/wiki/Rosalind_Ridley \"Rosalind Ridley\") in _Molecular Pathology of\nthe Prions_ (2001) has written that \"The prion hypothesis is not heretical to\nthe central dogma of molecular biology—that the information necessary to\nmanufacture proteins is encoded in the nucleotide sequence of nucleic\nacid—because it does not claim that proteins replicate. Rather, it claims that\nthere is a source of information within protein molecules that contributes to\ntheir biological function, and that this information can be passed on to other\nmolecules.\"[10]\n\n### Natural genetic\nengineering[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Natural genetic engineering\")]\n\n[James A. Shapiro](/wiki/James_A._Shapiro \"James A. Shapiro\") argues that a\nsuperset of these examples should be classified as [natural genetic\nengineering](/wiki/Natural_genetic_engineering \"Natural genetic engineering\")\nand are sufficient to falsify the central dogma. While Shapiro has received a\nrespectful hearing for his view, his critics have not been convinced that his\nreading of the central dogma is in line with what Crick intended.[11][12]\n\n## Use of the term\n\"dogma\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Use of the term \"dogma\"\")]\n\nIn his [autobiography](/wiki/Autobiography \"Autobiography\"), _[What Mad\nPursuit](/wiki/What_Mad_Pursuit:_A_Personal_View_of_Scientific_Discovery \"What\nMad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery\")_ , Crick wrote about\nhis choice of the word _[dogma](/wiki/Dogma \"Dogma\")_ and some of the problems\nit caused him:\n\n> \"I called this idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had\n> already used the obvious word [hypothesis](/wiki/Hypothesis \"Hypothesis\") in\n> the [sequence hypothesis](/wiki/Sequence_hypothesis \"Sequence hypothesis\"),\n> and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new assumption was more\n> central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, the use of the word dogma\n> caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later [Jacques\n> Monod](/wiki/Jacques_Monod \"Jacques Monod\") pointed out to me that I did not\n> appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief\n> _that cannot be doubted_. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but\n> since I thought that _all_ religious beliefs were without foundation, I used\n> the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does,\n> and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had\n> little direct experimental support.\"\n\nSimilarly, [Horace Freeland Judson](/wiki/Horace_Freeland_Judson \"Horace\nFreeland Judson\") records in _The Eighth Day of Creation_ :[13]\n\n> \"My mind was, that a dogma was an idea for which there was _no reasonable\n> evidence_. You see?!\" And Crick gave a roar of delight. \"I just didn't\n> _know_ what dogma _meant_. And I could just as well have called it the\n> 'Central Hypothesis,' or — you know. Which is what I meant to say. Dogma was\n> just a catch phrase.\"\n\n## Comparison with the Weismann\nbarrier[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Comparison with the Weismann barrier\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Weismann%27s_Germ_Plasm.svg/330px-\nWeismann%27s_Germ_Plasm.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Weismann%27s_Germ_Plasm.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Weismann%27s_Germ_Plasm.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIn [August Weismann](/wiki/August_Weismann \"August Weismann\")'s [germ\nplasm](/wiki/Germ_plasm \"Germ plasm\") theory, the hereditary material, the\ngerm plasm, is confined to the [gonads](/wiki/Gonad \"Gonad\"). Somatic cells\n(of the body) [develop afresh](/wiki/Embryology \"Embryology\") in each\ngeneration from the germ plasm. Whatever may happen to those cells does not\naffect the next generation.\n\nThe Weismann barrier, proposed by [August Weismann](/wiki/August_Weismann\n\"August Weismann\") in 1892, distinguishes between the \"immortal\" germ cell\nlineages (the [germ plasm](/wiki/Germ_plasm \"Germ plasm\")) which produce\ngametes and the \"disposable\" somatic cells. Hereditary information moves only\nfrom [germline](/wiki/Germline \"Germline\") cells to [somatic\ncells](/wiki/Somatic_cells \"Somatic cells\") (that is, somatic mutations are\nnot inherited). This, before the discovery of the role or structure of DNA,\ndoes not predict the central dogma, but does anticipate its gene-centric view\nof life, albeit in non-molecular terms.[14]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Alternative splicing](/wiki/Alternative_splicing \"Alternative splicing\")\n  * [Genetic code](/wiki/Genetic_code \"Genetic code\")\n  * [Riboswitch](/wiki/Riboswitch \"Riboswitch\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Leavitt, Sarah A.
