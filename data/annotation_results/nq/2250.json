It was ignored in banking transactions, which\nwere carried out in units of 1p.\n\nThe decimal halfpenny had the same value as 1.2 pre-decimal pence, and was\nintroduced to enable the prices of some low-value items to be more accurately\ntranslated to the new decimal currency. The possibility of setting prices\nincluding an odd half penny also made it more practical to retain the pre-\ndecimal [sixpence](/wiki/British_sixpence_coin \"British sixpence coin\") in\ncirculation (with a value of 2 1/2 new pence) alongside the new decimal\ncoinage.\n\nThe halfpenny coin's obverse featured the profile of [Queen Elizabeth\nII](/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II \"Queen Elizabeth II\"); the reverse featured an\nimage of [St Edward's Crown](/wiki/St_Edward%27s_Crown \"St Edward's Crown\").\nIt was minted in bronze (like the 1p and 2p coins). It was the smallest\ndecimal coin in both size and value. The size was in proportion to the 1p and\n2p coins. It soon became Britain's least favourite coin.[1] [The\nTreasury](/wiki/HM_Treasury \"HM Treasury\") had continued to argue that the\nhalfpenny was important in the fight against inflation (preventing prices from\nbeing rounded up).[1] The coin was demonetised and [withdrawn from\ncirculation](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_low-denomination_coins \"Withdrawal of low-\ndenomination coins\") in December 1984.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Design\n  * 2 Mintages\n  * 3 Proposed quarter penny coin\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n##\nDesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Halfpenny_\\(British_decimal_coin\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\nThe [reverse](/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse \"Obverse and reverse\") of the coin,\ndesigned by [Christopher Ironside](/wiki/Christopher_Ironside \"Christopher\nIronside\"), was a representation of [St Edward's\nCrown](/wiki/St_Edward%27s_Crown \"St Edward's Crown\"), with the numeral \"1/2\"\nbelow the crown, and either NEW PENNY (1971–1981) or HALF PENNY (1982–1984)\nabove the crown.\n\nOnly one design of [obverse](/wiki/Obverse \"Obverse\") was used on the\nhalfpenny coin. The inscription around the portrait on the obverse was\nELIZABETH II [D.G.REG.F.D.](/wiki/British_coinage#D.G.REG.F.D. \"British\ncoinage\") 19xx,[2] where 19xx was the year of minting. Both sides of the coin\nare encircled by dots, a common feature on coins, known as beading.\n\nAs on all decimal coins produced before 1984, the portrait of [Queen Elizabeth\nII](/wiki/Elizabeth_II \"Elizabeth II\") by [Arnold Machin](/wiki/Arnold_Machin\n\"Arnold Machin\") appeared on the obverse;[3] in this portrait the Queen wears\nthe ['Girls of Great Britain and Ireland'\nTiara](/wiki/Girls_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_Tiara \"Girls of Great Britain\nand Ireland Tiara\").\n\n##\nMintages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Halfpenny_\\(British_decimal_coin\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Mintages\")]\n\nAnnual number of coins released into general circulation (excludes proof\nsets)[4]\n\n  * 1971 ~ 1,394,188,251\n  * 1972 ~ In proof sets only\n  * 1973 ~ 365,680,000\n  * 1974 ~ 365,448,000\n  * 1975 ~ 197,600,000\n  * 1976 ~ 412,172,000\n  * 1977 ~ 66,368,000\n  * 1978 ~ 59,532,000\n  * 1979 ~ 219,132,000\n  * 1980 ~ 202,788,000\n  * 1981 ~ 46,748,000\n  * 1982 ~ 190,752,000\n  * 1983 ~ 7,600,000\n  * 1984 ~ In proof sets only\n\n## Proposed quarter penny\ncoin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Halfpenny_\\(British_decimal_coin\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Proposed quarter penny coin\")]\n\nA decimal quarter-penny coin (to be struck in [aluminium](/wiki/Aluminium\n\"Aluminium\")) was also proposed (which would have allowed the pre-decimal\n[threepence](/wiki/History_of_the_threepence \"History of the threepence\") to\ncontinue to circulate with a value of 1 1/4 new pence), but was never\nproduced.[5]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Halfpenny_\\(British_decimal_coin\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Halfpenny (Irish decimal coin)](/wiki/Halfpenny_\\(Irish_decimal_coin\\) \"Halfpenny \\(Irish decimal coin\\)\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Halfpenny_\\(British_decimal_coin\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ [1984: Halfpenny coin to meet its maker](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/1/newsid_2828000/2828819.stm), _BBC News_\n  2. **Jump up ^** Clayton, Tony.
