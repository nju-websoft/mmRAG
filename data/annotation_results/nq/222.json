It's inherently and inextricably linked to Tris'\ncharacter journey. There will be plenty of sexual tension and chemistry, but\nit's important that all of that stuff doesn't just feel like it's thrown in,\nbut that it all helps Tris grow as a character.\"[8] Daugherty further added,\n\"It's tricky because the book is a very packed read with a lot of big ideas.\nSo, distilling that into a cool, faithful two-hour movie is challenging. Not\nonly do you have to establish five factions, but you have to acknowledge that\nthere's a sixth entity, which is the divergent, and you also have the\nfactionless. So there's a world that really has to be built out for the big\nscreen… the movie is going to do it a little more efficiently.\"[9] Author\n[Veronica Roth](/wiki/Veronica_Roth \"Veronica Roth\") said about the script of\nthe film: \"Reading a script is a really interesting experience.
