        "# List of moments of inertia\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nIn [physics](/wiki/Physics \"Physics\") and [applied\nmathematics](/wiki/Applied_mathematics \"Applied mathematics\"), the mass\n[moment of inertia](/wiki/Moment_of_inertia \"Moment of inertia\"), usually\ndenoted by I, measures the extent to which an object resists rotational\nacceleration about a particular axis, and is the rotational analogue to mass.\nMass moments of inertia have [units](/wiki/Physical_unit \"Physical unit\") of\n[dimension](/wiki/Dimensional_analysis \"Dimensional analysis\") ML2([mass] ×\n[length]2). It should not be confused with the [second moment of\narea](/wiki/Second_moment_of_area \"Second moment of area\"), which is used in\nbeam calculations. The mass moment of inertia is often also known as the\nrotational inertia, and sometimes as the angular mass.\n\nFor simple objects with geometric symmetry, one can often determine the moment\nof inertia in an exact [closed-form expression](/wiki/Closed-form_expression\n\"Closed-form expression\"). Typically this occurs when the [mass\ndensity](/wiki/Mass_density \"Mass density\") is constant, but in some cases the\ndensity can vary throughout the object as well. In general, it may not be\nstraightforward to symbolically express the moment of inertia of shapes with\nmore complicated mass distributions and lacking symmetry. When calculating\nmoments of inertia, it is useful to remember that it is an additive function\nand exploit the [parallel axis](/wiki/Parallel_axis_theorem \"Parallel axis\ntheorem\") and [perpendicular axis theorems](/wiki/Perpendicular_axis_theorem\n\"Perpendicular axis theorem\").\n\nThis article mainly considers symmetric mass distributions, with constant\ndensity throughout the object, and the axis of rotation is taken to be through\nthe [center of mass](/wiki/Center_of_mass \"Center of mass\") unless otherwise\nspecified.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Moments of inertia\n  * 2 List of 3D inertia tensors\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Moments of\ninertia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_moments_of_inertia&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Moments of inertia\")]\n\nFollowing are scalar moments of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia is\na tensor, see below.\n\nDescription | Figure | Moment(s) of inertia  \n---|---|---  \nPoint mass _m_ at a distance _r_ from the axis of rotation.

It offers some context that could aid in understanding how to calculate moment of inertia about a specific point, especially using the parallel axis theorem. However, it lacks direct mention of the radius of gyration or explicit calculations for a rod about a point not at its center. Thus, it's considered partially relevant."
