Some computer files were stolen, and\nsecurity camera tapes identify the perpetrator as Jack Hyde, Ana's former boss\nwho was fired for sexual assault. Meanwhile, Ana is introduced to her new\npersonal security team.\n\nChristian surprises Ana with a new house and has hired architect Gia Matteo to\nrebuild it. Ana is dismayed when Gia, an attractive young woman, openly flirts\nwith Christian in Ana's presence. Ana privately threatens to dismiss Gia if\nshe continues her flirtatious behavior, forcing her to stop.\n\nWhen Christian is away on a business trip, Ana disregards his wishes that she\nstay at home, and goes out for a drink with her friend, Kate Kavanagh. Kate,\nwho is dating Christian's younger brother, Elliot, confides to Ana that their\nrelationship may be fizzling; Elliot is working closely with Gia, the\narchitect, and Kate is suspicious about their relationship. When Ana returns\nhome, she encounters Jack Hyde, who holds her hostage and attempts to kidnap\nher. Ana's security team subdue him and he is arrested. After an argument with\nChristian about her having sneaked out to see Kate, Ana berates Christian for\nbeing overly controlling and possessive and demands more freedom. Soon after,\nChristian surprises Ana with a trip to Aspen, bringing along Kate, Elliot,\nMia, and José.\n\nChristian and Ana continue with their erotic sexual experimentation, but\nmatters become complicated when Ana announces she is pregnant. Christian is\ndeeply disturbed, saying he had other plans for their early years together. He\nleaves, going on a night-long drunken bender. The next day, Ana discovers that\nChristian had recently contacted his ex-lover and former [BDSM](/wiki/BDSM\n\"BDSM\") dominant, Elena Lincoln. Meanwhile, Jack Hyde is released on a\n$500,000 bail.\n\nAfter some days, mayhem erupts when Jack Hyde phones Ana demanding a ransom\nfor Mia, Christian's abducted sister. Hyde demands $5,000,000 in cash in two\nhours or Mia will be killed. He warns Ana to tell no one and to bring the\nmoney alone. Ana takes some cash and a revolver from the house safe, then goes\nto the bank to withdraw the full amount. The suspicious bank manager calls\nChristian. He thinks Ana is leaving him but then notes the coincidence of\nHyde's recent release and Ana's sudden large cash withdrawal. Hyde instructs\nAna to get into a car parked in the alley and to hand over her phone to the\ndriver to discard. Ana tricks Hyde by taking the bank manager's phone. She\nexits the back entrance to discover that the driver and Jack's accomplice is\nher co-worker, Liz. She is the woman who drove the car that chased them down.\n\nAna arrives at the drop-off site with the money. Hyde, psychotic and vengeful,\nattacks Ana, kicking her in the abdomen. Liz tries to stop Jack as Ana pulls\nout the revolver and shoots Hyde in the leg. Christian and his security team,\nwho electronically tracked Ana's cell phone, arrive and apprehend Hyde and\nLiz. Ana blacks out as she hears Christian calling her.\n\nAna awakens three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side.\nThough angry at Ana's recklessness and still anxious about fatherhood,\nChristian realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile.\nChristian's adoptive mother, Grace, convinces Christian that Ana will not\nleave him. Ana returns home the next day. Christian's private investigator,\nWelch, reports that Christian and Hyde shared the same foster family. It is\nalso learned that Hyde blackmailed Liz into being his accomplice. Christian\nand Ana later locate where Christian's birth mother is buried; they visit and\nChristian lays flowers on her grave.\n\nTwo years later, Christian and Ana have had their child who they have named\nTeddy. Ana is now pregnant with their second child. They play with their son\nin the yard of their mansion.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fifty_Shades_Freed_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Dakota Johnson](/wiki/Dakota_Johnson \"Dakota Johnson\") as Anastasia 'Ana' Steele-Grey\n  * [Jamie Dornan](/wiki/Jamie_Dornan \"Jamie Dornan\") as Christian Grey\n  * [Eric Johnson](/wiki/Eric_Johnson_\\(actor\\) \"Eric Johnson \\(actor\\)\") as Jack Hyde, Ana’s former boss and stalker\n  * [Eloise Mumford](/wiki/Eloise_Mumford \"Eloise Mumford\") as Katherine Kavanagh, Ana’s best friend and Elliot Grey’s fiancée\n  * [Rita Ora](/wiki/Rita_Ora \"Rita Ora\") as Mia Grey, adoptive daughter of Carrick Grey and Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey and younger sister of Christian and Elliot Grey\n  * [Luke Grimes](/wiki/Luke_Grimes \"Luke Grimes\") as Elliot Grey, younger brother of Christian and Mia Grey and Katherine’s fiancée\n  * [Victor Rasuk](/wiki/Victor_Rasuk \"Victor Rasuk\") as José Rodriguez, one of Anastasia's friends\n  * [Max Martini](/wiki/Max_Martini \"Max Martini\") as Jason Taylor, Christian’s bodyguard\n  * [Jennifer Ehle](/wiki/Jennifer_Ehle \"Jennifer Ehle\") as Carla May Wilks, Anastasia's mother.\n  * [Marcia Gay Harden](/wiki/Marcia_Gay_Harden \"Marcia Gay Harden\") as Grace Trevelyan Grey, Christian’s adoptive mother\n  * [Bruce Altman](/wiki/Bruce_Altman \"Bruce Altman\") as Jerry Roach\n  * [Arielle Kebbel](/wiki/Arielle_Kebbel \"Arielle Kebbel\") as Gia Matteo, the architect recommended by Elliot Grey to design Anastasia and Christian's future home\n  * [Callum Keith Rennie](/wiki/Callum_Keith_Rennie \"Callum Keith Rennie\") as Ray, Anastasia's former stepfather\n  * [Robinne Lee](/wiki/Robinne_Lee \"Robinne Lee\") as Ros Bailey, Christian's second in command\n  * [Brant Daugherty](/wiki/Brant_Daugherty \"Brant Daugherty\") as Luke Sawyer, Ana’s bodyguard\n  * [Fay Masterson](/wiki/Fay_Masterson \"Fay Masterson\") as Gail Jones, Christian's housekeeper\n  * [Amy Price-Francis](/wiki/Amy_Price-Francis \"Amy Price-Francis\") as Liz Morgan, Jack's accomplice\n  * Ashleigh LaThrop as Hannah, Ana's co-worker and friend\n  * [Tyler Hoechlin](/wiki/Tyler_Hoechlin \"Tyler Hoechlin\") as Boyce Fox, popular author whose books are published by SIP.\n  * [Hiro Kanagawa](/wiki/Hiro_Kanagawa \"Hiro Kanagawa\") as Detective Clark\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fifty_Shades_Freed_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nA film adaptation of the first book was produced by [Michael De Luca\nProductions](/wiki/Michael_De_Luca_Productions \"Michael De Luca\nProductions\"),[3][4] with [Universal Pictures](/wiki/Universal_Pictures\n\"Universal Pictures\") and [Focus Features](/wiki/Focus_Features \"Focus\nFeatures\") securing the rights to the trilogy in March 2012.[3] At a fan\nscreening in New York City on February 6, director [Sam Taylor-\nJohnson](/wiki/Sam_Taylor-Johnson \"Sam Taylor-Johnson\") announced that the\nbook sequels _[Fifty Shades Darker](/wiki/Fifty_Shades_Darker \"Fifty Shades\nDarker\")_ and _[Fifty Shades Freed](/wiki/Fifty_Shades_Freed \"Fifty Shades\nFreed\")_ would also be adapted, with the first to be released in 2016.[5]\nRight after the announcement, Taylor-Johnson told _[Digital\nSpy](/wiki/Digital_Spy \"Digital Spy\")_ that, \"It's not my decision [to\nreturn], and I haven't been privy to any of the discussions.\"[6] On November\n12, 2015, [TheWrap](/wiki/TheWrap \"TheWrap\") confirmed that [James\nFoley](/wiki/James_Foley_\\(director\\) \"James Foley \\(director\\)\") would direct\nboth sequels which would be shot back-to-back in 2016, with Niall Leonard\nwriting the script and Michael De Luca and [Dana Brunetti](/wiki/Dana_Brunetti\n\"Dana Brunetti\") returning to produce along with [E.
