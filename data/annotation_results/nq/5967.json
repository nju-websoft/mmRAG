The [revolutionary](/wiki/Revolutionary\n\"Revolutionary\") is portrayed in the _Catechism_ as an amoral avenging angel,\nan expendable resource in the service of the revolution,[6] committed to any\ncrime or treachery necessary to effect the downfall of the prevailing\norder.[4]\n\n> The revolutionary is a doomed man. He has no private interests, no affairs,\n> sentiments, ties, property nor even a name of his own. His entire being is\n> devoured by one purpose, one thought, one passion - the revolution. Heart\n> and soul, not merely by word but by deed, he has severed every link with the\n> social order and with the entire civilized world; with the laws, good\n> manners, conventions, and morality of that world. He is its merciless enemy\n> and continues to inhabit it with only one purpose - to destroy it. –\n>\n> —  _Catechism of a Revolutionary_ , opening lines.[7]\n\n##\nCriticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catechism_of_a_Revolutionary&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Criticism\")]\n\n[Critics of anarchism](/wiki/Criticism_of_anarchism \"Criticism of anarchism\")\nargue that the _Catechism_ reflects the innately violent and\n[nihilistic](/wiki/Nihilism \"Nihilism\") nature of the philosophy.[9] Scholar\n[Michael Allen Gillespie](/wiki/Michael_Allen_Gillespie \"Michael Allen\nGillespie\") has hailed the _Catechism_ as \"a pre-eminent expression of the\ndoctrine of freedom and negation\" that arose in the\n[Fichtean](/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte \"Johann Gottlieb Fichte\") notion of\nthe \"Absolute I\" that had been concealed in [Left\nHegelianism](/wiki/Left_Hegelianism \"Left Hegelianism\").[6] Prominent [Black\nPanther](/wiki/Black_Panther_Party \"Black Panther Party\") of the 20th century\n[Eldridge Cleaver](/wiki/Eldridge_Cleaver \"Eldridge Cleaver\") adopted the\n_Catechism_ as a \"revolutionary bible\", incorporating it into his daily life\nto the extent that he employed, in his words, \"tactics of ruthlessness in my\ndealings with everyone with whom I came into contact\".[10] The ideas and\nsentiments in the work had been in part previously aired by\n[Zaichnevsky](/w/index.php?title=Zaichnevsky&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Zaichnevsky \\(page does not exist\\)\") and [Nikolai\nIshutin](/wiki/Nikolai_Ishutin \"Nikolai Ishutin\") in Russia, and by\n[Carbonari](/wiki/Carbonari \"Carbonari\") and [Young\nItaly](/wiki/Young_Italy_\\(historical\\) \"Young Italy \\(historical\\)\") in the\nWest.[11]\n\nThe journal _Cahiers du monde russe et soviétique_ published a letter from\nBakunin to Nechayev, in which Bakunin wrote, \"You remember how you were angry\nwith me, when I called you [abrek](/wiki/Abrek \"Abrek\") and called your\nCatechism the Catechism of abreks?\"[12]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catechism_of_a_Revolutionary&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Russian nihilist movement](/wiki/Russian_nihilist_movement \"Russian nihilist movement\")\n  * [Anarchism and violence](/wiki/Anarchism_and_violence \"Anarchism and violence\")\n  * [Professional revolutionaries](/wiki/Professional_revolutionaries \"Professional revolutionaries\")\n  * _[The Demons](/wiki/Demons_\\(Dostoyevsky_novel\\) \"Demons \\(Dostoyevsky novel\\)\")_ , an 1872 novel by [Fyodor Dostoevsky](/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky \"Fyodor Dostoevsky\") influenced by the events surrounding the publication of the _Catechism_.\n\n##\nFootnotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Catechism_of_a_Revolutionary&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Footnotes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Leier, Mark (2006). _[Bakunin: The Creative Passion](/w/index.php?title=Bakunin:_The_Creative_Passion&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Bakunin: The Creative Passion \\(page does not exist\\)\")_.
