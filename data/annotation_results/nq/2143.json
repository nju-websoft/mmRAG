According to the doctrine, any\n[princely state](/wiki/Principality \"Principality\") or territory under the\ndirect influence (paramountacy) of the [British East India\nCompany](/wiki/British_East_India_Company \"British East India Company\") (the\ndominant [imperial](/wiki/Imperialism \"Imperialism\") power in the\n[subcontinent](/wiki/Indian_subcontinent \"Indian subcontinent\")), as a [vassal\nstate](/wiki/Vassal_state \"Vassal state\") under the British subsidiary system,\nwould automatically be annexed if the ruler was either \"manifestly incompetent\nor died without a male heir\".[1] The latter supplanted the long-established\nright of an Indian sovereign without an heir to choose a successor.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\naddition, the British decided whether potential rulers were competent enough.\nThe doctrine and its application were widely regarded by many Indians as\nillegitimate.\n\nThe policy is most commonly associated with [Lord\nDalhousie](/wiki/James_Andrew_Broun-Ramsay,_1st_Marquess_of_Dalhousie \"James\nAndrew Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie\"), who was the [Governor\nGeneral](/wiki/Governor_General \"Governor General\") for the [East India\nCompany](/wiki/East_India_Company \"East India Company\") in [India](/wiki/India\n\"India\") between 1848 and 1856. However, it was articulated by the Court of\nDirectors of the East India Company as early as 1834 and several smaller\nstates were already annexed under this doctrine before Dalhousie took over the\npost of Governor-General. Dalhousie used the policy most vigorously and\nextensively, though, so it is generally associated with him.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Doctrine of lapse before Dalhousie\n  * 3 Princely states annexed under the doctrine\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Doctrine_of_lapse&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nAt the time of its adoption, the British East India Company had imperial\nadministrative jurisdiction over wide regions of the subcontinent. The company\ntook over the princely states of\n[Satara](/w/index.php?title=Satara_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Satara State\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") (1848), [Jaitpur](/wiki/Jaitpur_State \"Jaitpur\nState\") and [Sambalpur](/wiki/Sambalpur_State \"Sambalpur State\") (1849),\n[Nagpur](/wiki/Nagpur_State \"Nagpur State\") and [Jhansi](/wiki/Jhansi_State\n\"Jhansi State\") (1854), [Tanjore](/wiki/Thanjavur_Maratha_kingdom \"Thanjavur\nMaratha kingdom\") and [Arcot](/wiki/Nawab_of_the_Carnatic \"Nawab of the\nCarnatic\") (1855) and [Udaipur\n(Chhattisgarh)](/wiki/Udaipur_State,_Chhattisgarh \"Udaipur State,\nChhattisgarh\") under the terms of the doctrine of lapse.\n[Oudh](/wiki/Oudh_State \"Oudh State\") (1856) is widely believed to have been\nannexed under the Doctrine of Lapse. However it was annexed by Lord Dalhousie\nunder the pretext of mis-governance. Mostly claiming that the ruler was not\nruling properly, the Company added about four million pounds sterling to its\nannual revenue by virtue of this doctrine.[2] Udaipur State, however, would\nhave local rule reinstated by the British in 1860.[3]\n\nWith the increasing power of the East India Company, discontent simmered among\nmany sections of Indian society and the largely indigenous armed forces; these\nrallied behind the deposed dynasties during the [Indian Rebellion of\n1857](/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857 \"Indian Rebellion of 1857\"), also known\nas the Sepoy Mutiny. Following the rebellion, in 1858, the new British\n[Viceroy](/wiki/Viceroy \"Viceroy\") of India, whose rule replaced that of the\nBritish East India Company, renounced the doctrine.[4]\n\nThe princely state of\n[Kittur](/w/index.php?title=Kittur_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kittur State\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") was taken over by the East India Company in 1824 by\nimposing a 'doctrine of lapse'. So it is debatable whether it was devised by\nLord Dalhousie in 1848, though he arguably made it official by documenting it.\nDalhousie's annexations and the doctrine of lapse had caused suspicion and\nuneasiness among most ruling princes in India.\n\n## Doctrine of lapse before\nDalhousie[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Doctrine_of_lapse&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Doctrine of lapse before Dalhousie\")]\n\nDalhousie applied the doctrine of lapse vigorously for annexing Indian\nprincely states, but the policy was not solely of his invention. The [Court of\nDirectors](/wiki/List_of_East_India_Company_directors \"List of East India\nCompany directors\") of the East India Company had articulated this early in\n1834.[5] As per this policy, the Company annexed [Mandvi](/wiki/Mandvi\n\"Mandvi\") in 1839,\n[Kolaba](/w/index.php?title=Kolaba_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kolaba State\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") and [Jalaun](/wiki/Jalaun_State \"Jalaun State\") in\n1840 and [Surat](/wiki/Surat \"Surat\") in 1842.\n\n## Princely states annexed under the\ndoctrine[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Doctrine_of_lapse&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Princely states annexed under the doctrine\")]\n\n  * [Angul](/w/index.php?title=Angul_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Angul State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1848)\n  * [Arcot](/wiki/Arcot_State \"Arcot State\") (1855)\n  * [Banda](/w/index.php?title=Banda_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Banda State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1858)\n  * [Guler](/wiki/Guler_State \"Guler State\") (1813)\n  * [Jaintia](/w/index.php?title=Jaintia_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Jaintia State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1835)\n  * [Jaitpur](/wiki/Jaitpur_State \"Jaitpur State\") (1849)\n  * [Jalaun](/wiki/Jalaun_State \"Jalaun State\") (1840)\n  * [Jaswan](/wiki/Jaswan_State \"Jaswan State\") (1849)\n  * [Jhansi](/wiki/Jhansi_State \"Jhansi State\") (1854)\n  * [Kachari](/w/index.php?title=Kachari_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kachari State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1830)\n  * [Kangra](/wiki/Kangra_State \"Kangra State\") (1846)\n  * [Kannanur](/w/index.php?title=Kannanur_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kannanur State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1819)\n  * [Kittur](/wiki/Kittur \"Kittur\") (1824)\n  * [Kodagu](/w/index.php?title=Kodagu_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kodagu State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1834)\n  * [Kolaba](/w/index.php?title=Kolaba_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kolaba State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1840)\n  * [Kozhikode](/w/index.php?title=Kozhikode_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kozhikode State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1806)\n  * [Kullu](/w/index.php?title=Kullu_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kullu State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1846)\n  * [Kurnool](/w/index.php?title=Kurnool_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kurnool State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1839)\n  * [Kutlehar](/wiki/Kutlehar_State \"Kutlehar State\") (1825)\n  * [Makrai](/wiki/Makrai_State \"Makrai State\") (1890); local rule reinstated by the British in 1893\n  * [Nagpur](/wiki/Nagpur_State \"Nagpur State\") (1854)\n  * [Nargund](/w/index.php?title=Nargund_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Nargund State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1858)\n  * [Oudh](/wiki/Oudh_State \"Oudh State\") (1854)\n  * [Punjab](/wiki/Punjab_State \"Punjab State\") (1849)\n  * [Ramgarh](/w/index.php?title=Ramgarh_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Ramgarh State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1858)\n  * [Sambalpur](/wiki/Sambalpur_State \"Sambalpur State\") (1849)\n  * [Satara](/w/index.php?title=Satara_State&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Satara State \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1848)\n  * [Surat](/wiki/Surat \"Surat\") (1842)\n  * [Siba](/wiki/Siba_State \"Siba State\") (1849)\n  * [Tanjore](/wiki/Thanjavur_Maratha_kingdom \"Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\") (1855)\n  * [Tulsipur](/wiki/Tulsipur_State \"Tulsipur State\") (1854)\n  * [Udaipur, Chhattisgarh](/wiki/Udaipur_State,_Chhattisgarh \"Udaipur State, Chhattisgarh\") (1854); local rule reinstated by the British in 1860\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Doctrine_of_lapse&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Colonialism](/wiki/Colonialism \"Colonialism\")\n  * [Escheat](/wiki/Escheat \"Escheat\")\n  * [List of princely states of India](/wiki/List_of_princely_states_of_India \"List of princely states of India\")\n  * [Presidencies and provinces of British India](/wiki/Presidencies_and_provinces_of_British_India \"Presidencies and provinces of British India\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Doctrine_of_lapse&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Keay, John](/wiki/John_Keay \"John Keay\"). _India: A History_.
