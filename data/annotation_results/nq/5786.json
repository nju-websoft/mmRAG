Interactive\nEntertainment](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Interactive_Entertainment \"Warner Bros.\nInteractive Entertainment\"). It is the sequel to 2014's _[Middle-earth: Shadow\nof Mordor](/wiki/Middle-earth:_Shadow_of_Mordor \"Middle-earth: Shadow of\nMordor\")_ , and was released worldwide for [Microsoft\nWindows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\"), [PlayStation\n4](/wiki/PlayStation_4 \"PlayStation 4\"), and [Xbox One](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox\nOne\") on October 10, 2017.\n\n_Shadow of War_ continues the previous game's narrative, which is based on [J.\nR. R. Tolkien](/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien \"J. R. R. Tolkien\")'s\n[legendarium](/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium \"Tolkien's legendarium\") and set\nbetween the events of _[The Hobbit](/wiki/The_Hobbit \"The Hobbit\")_ and _[The\nLord of the Rings](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings \"The Lord of the Rings\")_. Like\nits predecessor, the game also takes heavy inspiration from director [Peter\nJackson](/wiki/Peter_Jackson \"Peter Jackson\")'s _[The\nHobbit](/wiki/The_Hobbit_\\(film_series\\) \"The Hobbit \\(film series\\)\")_ and\n_[The Lord of the Rings](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_\\(film_series\\) \"The Lord\nof the Rings \\(film series\\)\")_ film adaptations. The player continues the\nstory of the ranger Talion and the spirit of the elf lord\n[Celebrimbor](/wiki/Celebrimbor \"Celebrimbor\"), who shares Talion's body, as\nthey forge a new [Ring of Power](/wiki/Rings_of_Power \"Rings of Power\") to\namass an army to fight against [Sauron](/wiki/Sauron \"Sauron\"). The game\nbuilds upon the \"Nemesis System\" introduced in _Shadow of Mordor_ , allowing\nTalion to gain followers from several races of Middle-earth, including\n[Uruks](/wiki/Uruk-hai \"Uruk-hai\") and [Ologs](/wiki/Olog-hai \"Olog-hai\"), and\nplan out complex strategies using these to complete missions.\n\n_Shadow of War_ had a generally positive reaction from critics, albeit more\nmixed than its predecessor; praise was aimed towards the gameplay and an\nimproved nemesis system, although story elements and changes made to\nestablished characters received some negative reactions, as well as the\ninclusion of [microtransactions](/wiki/Microtransaction \"Microtransaction\")\nand [loot boxes](/wiki/Loot_box \"Loot box\"). A [free-to-play](/wiki/Free-to-\nplay \"Free-to-play\") companion game for [iOS](/wiki/IOS \"IOS\") and\n[Android](/wiki/Android_\\(operating_system\\) \"Android \\(operating system\\)\")\ndevices was also released.[2] In July 2018, Warner Bros. Interactive\nEntertainment removed all microtransactions from the console/PC versions of\n_Shadow of War_.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Gameplay\n    * 1.1 Mobile versions\n  * 2 Plot\n    * 2.1 _Blade of Galadriel_\n    * 2.2 _Desolation of Mordor_\n  * 3 Development\n    * 3.1 Death of Michael Forgey\n  * 4 Release\n  * 5 Reception\n    * 5.1 Critical response\n    * 5.2 Accolades\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Gameplay[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle-\nearth:_Shadow_of_War&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Gameplay\")]\n\nSee also: [Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor § Gameplay](/wiki/Middle-\nearth:_Shadow_of_Mordor#Gameplay \"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor\")\n\n_Middle-earth: Shadow of War_ is an [action role-playing](/wiki/Action_role-\nplaying_game \"Action role-playing game\") game set in an [open\nworld](/wiki/Open_world \"Open world\") environment and played from a [third-\nperson perspective](/wiki/Virtual_camera_system#Third-person_view \"Virtual\ncamera system\"), following from its predecessor. The player controls the\ngame's protagonist Talion, who has several natural athletic and combat\nabilities as a ranger of Gondor, but also has unique abilities provided by the\nspirit of the elf lord Celebrimbor, with whom he shares his body. The player\nuses their combined abilities to complete various missions, typically aimed to\ndisrupt the armies of Sauron. The game includes [main\nquests](/wiki/Quest_\\(video_gaming\\) \"Quest \\(video gaming\\)\") that drive the\ngame's narrative, and numerous optional quests that can help the player boost\nTalion's abilities and Followers via the game's \"Nemesis System\". In contrast\nto the previous game, which was more of a [hack and\nslash](/wiki/Hack_and_slash \"Hack and slash\"), the game has an action role-\nplaying approach, creating a more personalized experience for each player.[4]\nIt also features a dynamic weather system as well as day-night cycle which\naffects the gameplay and enemy behavior.\n\nThe Nemesis System expands upon its introduction in _Shadow of Mordor_ to\napply to a larger part of the world, including other characters called\nFollowers that have behavior guided by how the player-character has interacted\nwith them. The player is able to transfer their top Nemesis and their most\nloyal follower from _Shadow of Mordor_ into _Shadow of War_.[5] It also\nincludes a garrison from which the player can access their Followers that has\neither been obtained from multiplayer, relocated with a reassignment order or\nthrough opening 'War chests' prior to the game's July update, it also contains\nloot boxes that players have already obtained, players' unused loot boxes that\nhave been obtained prior to the removal of the market still remains. The\nGarrison also contains training orders that are purchaseable with Mirian, it's\nin-game currency. \"Spoils of War\" and \"XP\" boosts are still available and can\nbe activated but not obtainable as of the July 17th patch, although, players'\nboosts prior to the update are still available.[6]\n\nThe game's multiplayer features a \"Social Conquest mode\", in which players are\nable to invade other players' fortresses and attempt to conquer them. This\nmode has two settings: friendly and ranked. Friendly allows the player to\ninvade someone's fortress, without the risk of losing your army. Ranked, on\nthe other hand, allows the player to invade, but with a risk of losing some of\ntheir Orc Followers permanently. [7]\n\n### Mobile versions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle-\nearth:_Shadow_of_War&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Mobile versions\")]\n\nThe mobile companion versions of _Shadow of War_ are played as a [real-time\nstrategy](/wiki/Real-time_strategy \"Real-time strategy\") [role-playing\ngame](/wiki/Role-playing_game \"Role-playing game\") from a [top-down\nperspective](/wiki/Top-down_perspective \"Top-down perspective\"), where players\ncan recruit characters from not only the console/PC versions of the game\nitself, but also characters from its 2014 predecessor _Shadow of Mordor_ and\neven [_The Lord of the Rings_ film\ntrilogy](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_\\(film_series\\) \"The Lord of the Rings\n\\(film series\\)\") to fight Sauron's forces in small-scale, action-packed\nbattles.[8] Like the console/PC versions of the game, players can make use of\nthe Nemesis system to gain extra advantages in battle,[9] as well as make\noptional [in-game purchases](/wiki/In-app_purchase \"In-app purchase\").\n\n## Plot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle-\nearth:_Shadow_of_War&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\n_Shadow of War_ continues the narrative from _Shadow of Mordor_ , following\nTalion who is still infused with the spirit of the elf lord Celebrimbor.\nTalion and Celebrimbor travel to Mt. Doom, where they forge a new Ring of\nPower free of Sauron's corruption. However, once the Ring is complete,\nCelebrimbor is abducted and held hostage by Shelob, who asks Talion to hand\nover the Ring in exchange for Celebrimbor. Talion reluctantly agrees and gives\nthe Ring to Shelob, who claims they have a common enemy in Sauron. She uses\nthe Ring to see into the future and directs Talion to the last Gondorian\nstronghold in Mordor, Minas Ithil, which is under siege by Sauron's forces due\nto the city's possession of a valuable Palantir. The Palantir would allow\nwhoever possesses it to see anything they wish, making it a valuable tool for\nCelebrimbor and a dangerous weapon for Sauron.\n\nTalion travels to Minas Ithil and quickly comes to odds with Celebrimbor.\nTalion wants to help his fellow Gondorians, while Celebrimbor believes the\ncity is already lost and the retrieval of the Palantir must take priority.\nTalion reasons that protecting Minas Ithil will also protect the Palantir and\nhe meets up with the city's defenders: General Castamir, his daughter Idril,\nand his lieutenant Baranor. Together, they sabotage Orcish efforts to break\ninto the city until Castamir betrays them, allowing the Orcs to breach the\ngates and handing over the Palantir to the Witch King of Angmar in return for\nsparing Idril. Castamir is killed by the Witch King and Talion is barely able\nto escape thanks to the help of Eltariel, an Elven assassin working on\nGaladriel's behalf. The Witch King seizes Minas Ithil, renaming it Minas\nMorgul. With the Palantir, Sauron realizes that Shelob is holding\nCelebrimbor's Ring and sends the Nazgûl to attack her. Talion is able to save\nShelob, who returns the Ring to him and tells him that the fate of Middle-\nearth is in his hands.\n\nWith the Ring back in his possession, Talion begins to use its power to\ndominate Orcs and build his army. During this time, he assists Idril and\nBaranor in rescuing Gondorian survivors, helps Carnan defeat the Balrog Tar\nGoroth and the necromancer Zog, is betrayed by one of his followers, and hunts\nthe Nazgûl alongside Eltariel. Eventually, Talion builds up enough strength to\nassault Sauron's fortress directly. During the battle, Talion faces Isildur,\nnow corrupted into a Nazgûl. Talion manages to defeat Isildur, but upon seeing\nhis memories of how he was corrupted by the One Ring, decides to destroy\nIsildur and release his spirit rather than dominate him. Celebrimbor remarks\nangrily that Isildur would have been a valuable asset to their cause, leading\nTalion to realize that Celebrimbor wishes to replace Sauron by dominating him\nrather than destroying him. Talion refuses to follow Celebrimbor's orders any\nmore, causing the wraith to abandon him and possess Eltariel instead.\n\nWithout Celebrimbor or the ring, Talion begins to die, but is visited by\nShelob in a vision. Shelob informs him that if Talion had gone on to fight\nSauron, they would have succeeded and Celebrimbor would have enslaved Sauron\nand marched on the rest of Middle-earth. She implores Talion to continue to\nfight to contain the darkness within Mordor. Deciding to put his fate in his\nown hands, Talion picks up the Ring of Power Isildur was wearing to preserve\nhis own life. He then uses the power of Isildur's Ring to assault and seize\nMinas Morgul, defeating the Witch King in the process. Talion then takes\npossession of the Palantir and observes Celebrimbor and Eltariel making their\nassault on Sauron. The two manage to gain the upper hand and Celebrimbor\nattempts to dominate Sauron, only for Sauron to cut off two of Eltariel's\nfingers, one of which is adorned with the Ring of Power, and merge himself\nwith Celebrimbor. As a result, Sauron and Celebrimbor remain trapped in\nSauron's tower in the form of a flaming eye as their spirits continue to\nbattle for dominance. Talion decides to use Minas Morgul as a fortress to keep\nSauron's forces contained in Mordor.\n\nDecades later, Talion succumbs to the corruption of Isildur's Ring, and joins\nSauron's forces as a Nazgûl, where he goes with the others to hunt\n[Frodo](/wiki/Frodo_Baggins \"Frodo Baggins\") and the One Ring. However, with\nthe destruction of Sauron and the One Ring, Talion dies with the rest of the\nNazgûl and his spirit is freed. He is last seen in the afterlife discarding\nhis weapons and armor as he walks off into the west.\n\n### _Blade of Galadriel_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle-\nearth:_Shadow_of_War&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Blade of\nGaladriel\")]\n\nFollowing the final battle between Celebrimbor and Sauron, Eltariel recovers\nCelebrimbor's Ring, and receives orders from Galadriel to continue hunting the\nremaining Nazgûl, including Talion. Eltariel reluctantly confronts Talion, who\nmanages to convince her that by working together, they can keep Sauron's\ninfluence contained within Mordor. However, he informs her that a new warchief\nis leading a massive army and has attacked many of his fortresses. Talion\ntasks Eltariel with defending one of his remaining forts while he goes to\ndefend another fort in Seregost. Eltarial manages to recruit several new\ntribes of orcs to fight for her and she successfully defends her fort from\nenemy attack, though Seregost falls. A pair of rogue Nazgûl arrive, revealing\nthey are the ones leading the new orc army as they plan to take advantage of\nSauron and the Witch-King's weakness to take over Middle-earth. After\nrendering Seregost uninhabitable with poison gas, Eltariel and Talion pursue\nthe Nazgûl twins to their stronghold, where Eltariel is able to defeat both of\nthem. Despite their defeat, Talion begins to succumb to the temptation of\nIsildur's Ring, forcing Eltariel to battle him. Though Eltariel is victorious,\nTalion tells her that he will inevitably be resurrected by Sauron. Afterwards,\nEltariel continues to battle the forces of Mordor until she witnesses the\ndestruction of the One Ring. Upon seeing Celebrimbor's spirit freed from\nSauron, Eltariel decides to go track him down.\n\n### _Desolation of Mordor_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle-\nearth:_Shadow_of_War&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Desolation of\nMordor\")]\n\nAfter the fall of Minas Ithil, Baranor journeys through Mordor seeking to hire\nmercenaries to help him seize the fortress of Shindram. On the way, he is\nattacked by wyrms and rescued by the dwarf Torvin, who helps develop gadgets\nfor Baranor such as a grappling hook and parachute. Baranor continues to the\nVanishing Sons mercenary camp, where he discovers they are led by his older\nbrother Jagai, who now goes by the name of Serka. Serka reluctantly agrees to\nhelp Baranor take Shindram in return for all of the loot stored inside.\nHowever, another mercenary, Zhoja, betrays Serka and hands him over to the\norcs. Baranor rescues Serka, who reasserts control over the Vanishing Sons and\nexecutes Zhoja. After repelling an orc attack, Baranor and Serka lead their\narmy and seize Shindram. However, rather than hold the fortress, they leave a\ntrap for the orcs sent to retake it. Baranor and Serka then leave to seize\nmore fortresses, deciding that Gorgoroth will be their next target.\n\n## Development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle-\nearth:_Shadow_of_War&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nCreative Director Michael de Plater said that the development of _Shadow of\nMordor_ was a learning study for Monolith in how to make [open\nworld](/wiki/Open_world \"Open world\") games, and the development team limited\nthemselves in the scope of what they could deliver for that game. With those\nlessons learned, de Plater said that Monolith was able to take a bolder step\nforward for _Shadow of War_ , saying \"[t]his was our ambition to do the big,\nblockbuster version of the ideas we’d begun to explore in the first game. It's\nkind of our _[Terminator 2](/wiki/Terminator_2 \"Terminator 2\")_ to\n_[Terminator](/wiki/The_Terminator \"The Terminator\")_.\"[10]\n\nMonolith wanted to move the game from the more solitary player experience to\none that captured the epic battles shown in [_The Lord of the Rings_\nfilms](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_\\(film_series\\) \"The Lord of the Rings\n\\(film series\\)\"). They created battle systems that enable large-scale battles\nwhere parts of the battle would be managed by the various Followers that the\nplayer has recruited, thus allowing the player to still focus on the violence\nand brutality of close-quarter combat.[10] Recognizing the violence inherent\nwith the Middle-earth setting, Monolith aimed to include light humorous\nelements that play off the thirst for violence that the orcs have, so that the\ngame would not \"wallow in it, or feel sadistic\".[10] The console/PC versions\nwere later confirmed to be rated Mature by the [ESRB](/wiki/ESRB \"ESRB\"), like\ntheir predecessor,[11] although the mobile versions are less violent and were\ngiven the milder Teen rating.[12]\n\n### Death of Michael Forgey[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle-\nearth:_Shadow_of_War&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Death of Michael\nForgey\")]\n\nOn March 3, 2016, Monolith's Executive Producer, Michael David Forgey, died of\ncancer. To commemorate the loss of _Shadow of War_ 's Executive Producer,\nMonolith and Warner Bros announced a [DLC](/wiki/Downloadable_content\n\"Downloadable content\") named \"Forthog Orc-Slayer\". Originally selling for $5,\nWarner Brothers promised to donate $3.50 of the proceeds from each sale of the\nDLC made from any of the majority of the [U.S. states](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S.\nstate\")[13][14] to the Forgey family through December 31, 2019.[15] Warner\nBrothers was criticized for attempting to cash in on Michael Forgey's\ndeath.[16] Following public backlash, on September 27, 2017, the DLC was made\nfree to all who purchased the game and all proceeds were refunded to those who\npurchased it beforehand, in favor of Warner Bros making a lump sum donation to\nthe Forgey family.[17]\n\n## Release[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle-\nearth:_Shadow_of_War&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Release\")]\n\n_Shadow of War_ was released for [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\n\"Microsoft Windows\"), [PlayStation 4](/wiki/PlayStation_4 \"PlayStation 4\"),\nand [Xbox One](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox One\"). The Play Anywhere feature extends\nto Microsoft's premium console, the [Xbox One X](/wiki/Xbox_One_X \"Xbox One\nX\").[18]\n\nThe title was originally scheduled to be released in August 2017, but in June\nof that year, Warner Bros.
