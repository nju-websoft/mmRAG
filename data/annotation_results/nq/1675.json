The study of the Welsh language is available\nto all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges and universities and in\nadult education. The study of the language is compulsory for all pupils in\nState Schools until the age of 16.\n\nSince [devolution](/wiki/Devolution \"Devolution\"), education policy in the\nfour constituent countries of the UK has diverged: for example,\n[England](/wiki/Education_in_England \"Education in England\") has pursued\nreforms based on diversity of school types and parental choice; Wales (and\n[Scotland](/wiki/Education_in_Scotland \"Education in Scotland\")) remain more\ncommitted to the concept of the community-based [comprehensive\nschool](/wiki/Comprehensive_school \"Comprehensive school\"). Systems of\ngovernance and regulation - the arrangements for planning, funding, quality-\nassuring and regulating learning, and for its local administration - are\nbecoming increasingly differentiated across the four [home\ncountries](/wiki/Home_countries \"Home countries\").[3] Education researcher\nDavid Reynolds claims that policy in Wales is driven by a \"producerist\"\n[paradigm](/wiki/Paradigm \"Paradigm\") emphasising collaboration between\neducational partners. He also alludes to lower funding in Welsh schools\ncompared to England, echoing similar concerns at university level. He\nconcludes that performance data does not suggest that Wales has improved more\nrapidly than England, although there are considerable difficulties in making\nthese kinds of assessments.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 The structure of the Welsh educational system\n    * 1.1 Compulsory schooling\n      * 1.1.1 Primary education\n      * 1.1.2 Secondary education\n    * 1.2 Further education\n    * 1.3 Adult community learning\n    * 1.4 Higher education\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n## The structure of the Welsh educational\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Education_in_Wales&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: The structure of the Welsh educational system\")]\n\n### Compulsory\nschooling[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Education_in_Wales&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Compulsory schooling\")]\n\nA child's age on 1 September determines the point of entry into the relevant\nstage of education. Education is compulsory beginning with the term following\nthe child's fifth birthday, but may take place at either\n[home](/wiki/Home_education_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Home education in the\nUnited Kingdom\") or school. Most parents choosing to educate through school-\nbased provision, however, enrol their children in the reception year in\nSeptember of that school year, with most children thus beginning school at age\nfour or four and a half. This age was traditionally much earlier than in most\nother Western nations,[5] but in recent years many European countries have\nlowered their age of compulsory education, usually by making one or more years\nof [kindergarten](/wiki/Kindergarten \"Kindergarten\") compulsory.[6]\n\n#### Primary\neducation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Education_in_Wales&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Primary education\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Celebrating_St_David%27s_Day_in_Barmouth_%285450589413%29.jpg/220px-\nCelebrating_St_David%27s_Day_in_Barmouth_%285450589413%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Celebrating_St_David%27s_Day_in_Barmouth_\\(5450589413\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Celebrating_St_David%27s_Day_in_Barmouth_\\(5450589413\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nPrimary school pupils in 1960, in [Barmouth](/wiki/Barmouth \"Barmouth\"),\ncelebrating St David's Day\n\nMain article: [Primary education in Wales](/wiki/Primary_education_in_Wales\n\"Primary education in Wales\")\n\nIn 2014/15, there were 1,330 primary schools in Wales with 273,400 pupils and\n12,240 full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers.

It began for 3- to 4-year-olds and by 2011 is in place for\n3- to 7-year-olds. It is based on experiential learning, in small groups, with\na teacher ratio of 1:8 for the youngest ages.\n\nIn 2014/15, there were 435 Welsh-medium primary schools with 65,460 pupils,\nrising from 64,366 in 2013/14 but the number of Welsh-medium primary schools\ndecreasing from 444.[7]\n\n#### Secondary\neducation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Education_in_Wales&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Secondary education\")]\n\nMain article: [Secondary education in\nWales](/wiki/Secondary_education_in_Wales \"Secondary education in Wales\")\n\nPupils in [secondary school](/wiki/Secondary_school \"Secondary school\") take\npart in the compulsory [GCSE](/wiki/GCSE \"GCSE\") and the non-compulsory\n[A-level](/wiki/A-level \"A-level\") or\n[BTEC](/wiki/Business_and_Technology_Education_Council \"Business and\nTechnology Education Council\") qualifications at age 16 and 18 respectively.\nSince 2007 the [Welsh Baccalaureate\nQualification](/wiki/Welsh_Baccalaureate_Qualification \"Welsh Baccalaureate\nQualification\") has also been available as an option although it was ungraded\nuntil 2014.\n\nIn 2014/15 there were 207 secondary schools (a drop of six since 2013/14) in\nWales with 182,408 pupils and 11,269 FTE teachers (a drop of 310 since\n2013/14). The pupil/teacher ratio was 17:1, which has remained largely the\nsame since 2000/01.[7] In 2015/16, there were 178,650 pupils in 205 secondary\nschools - a drop of 3,700 since 2014/15.[8] The same report found that in\n2015/16, there were 8,000 pupils in 34 independent schools, 4,540 pupils in 32\nindependent special schools, and 730 pupils in 25 pupil referral units.\n\nIn 2014/15, there were 50 Welsh-medium secondary (a drop of 2 since 2013/14)\nschools with 36,485 pupils, dropping from 37,400 in 2013/14.

Colleges vary in size and mission, and include general FE,\n[tertiary](/wiki/Tertiary_education \"Tertiary education\") and specialist\ninstitutions, including one [Roman Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholic \"Roman\nCatholic\") Sixth Form College and a residential [adult\neducation](/wiki/Adult_education \"Adult education\") college. Many colleges\noffer leisure learning and training programmes designed to meet the needs of\nbusiness.[12][13] In 2014/15 there were 263,315 FE students in Wales spanning\nthe entire availability of FE at multiple placements, including FE, HE (higher\neducation), LA (local authority) Community, and work-based learning.[7]\n\n### Adult community\nlearning[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Education_in_Wales&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Adult community learning\")]\n\n[Adult Community learning](/wiki/Adult_education \"Adult education\") is a form\nof adult education or [lifelong learning](/wiki/Lifelong_learning \"Lifelong\nlearning\") delivered and supported by local authorities in Wales.[14]\nProgrammes can be formal or [informal](/wiki/Nonformal_learning \"Nonformal\nlearning\"), non-accredited or accredited, and vocational, academic or leisure\norientated.[15] In 2015/16 there were 28,710 learners in Local Authority\nCommunity Learning.[7]\n\n### Higher\neducation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Education_in_Wales&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Higher education\")]\n\nSee also: [List of universities in Wales](/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Wales\n\"List of universities in Wales\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Cardiff_University_main_building.jpg/240px-\nCardiff_University_main_building.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cardiff_University_main_building.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cardiff_University_main_building.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMain Building of Cardiff University\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Uwlsdb.jpg/240px-\nUwlsdb.jpg)](/wiki/File:Uwlsdb.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Uwlsdb.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSt David's building of the University of Wales Lampeter - Wales' oldest\nUniversity\n\nStudents normally enter higher education (HE) from 18 onwards. All\nundergraduate education is largely state-financed (with Welsh students\ncontributing Â£1,255), and students are generally entitled to student loans for\nmaintenance. The state does not control syllabi, but it does influence\nadmission procedures and monitors standards through the [Higher Education\nFunding Council for Wales](/wiki/Higher_Education_Funding_Council_for_Wales\n\"Higher Education Funding Council for Wales\").\n\nThe typical first degree offered at Welsh universities is the [Bachelor's\ndegree](/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree \"Bachelor's degree\"), typically taking three\nyears to complete full-time. Some institutions offer an undergraduate master's\ndegree as a first degree, typically lasting four years. During a first degree\nstudents are known as undergraduates. Some universities offer a vocationally\nbased [Foundation degree](/wiki/Foundation_degree \"Foundation degree\"),\ntypically two years in length.\n\nWithin Wales, medical undergraduate education is provided by only [Cardiff\nUniversity](/wiki/Cardiff_University \"Cardiff University\"), while graduate\nfast track route training is provided at [Swansea\nUniversity](/wiki/Swansea_University \"Swansea University\"). In recent years\nthere has been an increase in the number of universities with their own degree\nawarding powers owing to the change in the [University of\nWales](/wiki/University_of_Wales \"University of Wales\") from a single awarding\nbody for most of the Universities in Wales to a confederal structure, along\nwith former institutes gaining university status. In 2014/15, there were 8 HE\ninstitutions in Wales including one music conservatoire, the [Royal Welsh\nCollege of Music and Drama](/wiki/Royal_Welsh_College_of_Music_and_Drama\n\"Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama\") in Cardiff which is part of the\nUniversity of Glamorgan Group. The [University of\nGlamorgan](/wiki/University_of_Glamorgan \"University of Glamorgan\"), the\nsecond largest university in Wales, has never been a member of the University\nof Wales and awards its own degrees: the Royal Welsh College of Music and\nDrama also awards University of Glamorgan degrees.\n\nIn 2014/15 there were 145,735 enrolments at HE institutions in Wales,\nincluding 97,900 first degree and other undergraduates and 27,780\npostgraduates. Welsh HE institutions had a total of 10,140 full-time and part-\ntime staff.[7]\n\nIn 2012, the minister with responsibility for education within Wales, Leighton\nAndrews, made a significant statement in relation to the merger of Cardiff\nMetropolitan University (CMU, formerly UWIC), the University of Glamorgan and\nUniversity of Wales, Newport (UWN),[16] in which he proposed the dissolution\nof CMU and UN as part of the process towards merger. However significant such\nchanges may seem, it is arguable that the effective imposition of an average\nundergraduate fee of Â£7.5 K pa for the three institutions (and others, but not\nto Cardiff, Swansea, Bangor and Aberystwyth all of whom will charge Â£9 K pa)\nwill cause much more substantial long term damage to these universities and\nreinvent the 'binary divide' between universities and the former polytechnics\nand HE institutes.[17]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Education_in_Wales&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Flag_of_Wales_%281959%E2%80%93present%29.svg/32px-Flag_of_Wales_%281959%E2%80%93present%29.svg.png)[Wales portal](/wiki/Portal:Wales \"Portal:Wales\")\n\n  * [Estyn](/wiki/Estyn \"Estyn\"), the education and training inspectorate for Wales\n  * [Music education in Wales](/wiki/Music_education_in_Wales \"Music education in Wales\")\n  * [Primary education in Wales](/wiki/Primary_education_in_Wales \"Primary education in Wales\")\n  * [Secondary education in Wales](/wiki/Secondary_education_in_Wales \"Secondary education in Wales\")\n  * [Treachery of the Blue Books](/wiki/Treachery_of_the_Blue_Books \"Treachery of the Blue Books\")\n\n  * [Education in England](/wiki/Education_in_England \"Education in England\")\n  * [Education in Northern Ireland](/wiki/Education_in_Northern_Ireland \"Education in Northern Ireland\")\n  * [Education in Scotland](/wiki/Education_in_Scotland \"Education in Scotland\")\n  * [List of education articles by country](/wiki/List_of_education_articles_by_country \"List of education articles by country\")\n  * [Home education in the United Kingdom](/wiki/Home_education_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Home education in the United Kingdom\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Education_in_Wales&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Estimate for the United Kingdom, from [United Kingdom](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html), [CIA World Factbook](/wiki/CIA_World_Factbook \"CIA World Factbook\")\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Comisiynydd: Nifer y plant mewn addysg Gymraeg yn 'sioc'\"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymrufyw/36974022). _BBC Cymru Fyw_ (in Welsh).
