        "# Distribution of wealth\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe **distribution of wealth** is a comparison of the [wealth](/wiki/Wealth\n\"Wealth\") of various members or groups in a [society](/wiki/Society\n\"Society\"). It differs from the [income\ndistribution](/wiki/Income_distribution \"Income distribution\") in that it\nlooks at the [economic distribution](/wiki/Distribution_\\(economics\\)\n\"Distribution \\(economics\\)\") of ownership of the [assets](/wiki/Asset\n\"Asset\") in a society, rather than the current income of members of that\nsociety. The distribution of wealth shows [economic\ndifferences](/wiki/Economic_inequality \"Economic inequality\") as per the [Gini\nindex](/wiki/Gini_coefficient \"Gini coefficient\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Definition of wealth\n  * 2 Data about global distribution of wealth\n    * 2.1 Wealth distribution pyramid\n      * 2.1.1 Wealth distribution in 2012\n  * 3 Statistical distributions\n  * 4 Redistribution of wealth and public policy\n  * 5 Wealth surveys\n  * 6 21st century\n    * 6.1 Wealth inequality\n    * 6.2 Real estate\n    * 6.3 Credit Suisse Report – Wealth Distribution & Gini (2013)\n  * 7 In the United States\n  * 8 Data, charts, and graphs\n    * 8.1 World distribution of wealth\n      * 8.1.1 By region\n  * 9 World distribution of financial wealth\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n## Definition of\nwealth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Definition of wealth\")]\n\nMain article: [Wealth](/wiki/Wealth \"Wealth\")\n\nWealth in the context of this article is defined as a person's net worth,\nexpressed as:\n\n    [wealth](/wiki/Wealth \"Wealth\") = [assets](/wiki/Asset \"Asset\") − [liabilities](/wiki/Liability_\\(financial_accounting\\) \"Liability \\(financial accounting\\)\")\n\nThe word _wealth_ is often confused with _[income](/wiki/Income \"Income\")_.\nThese two terms describe different but related things. Wealth consists of\nthose items of economic value that an individual owns, while income is an\n_inflow_ of items of economic value. (See [Stock and\nflow](/wiki/Stock_and_flow \"Stock and flow\").) The relation between wealth,\nincome, and expenses is:\n\n    change of wealth = income − expense.\n\nThe distribution of income is substantially different from the distribution of\nwealth. According to the International Association for Research in Income and\nWealth, \"the world distribution of wealth is much more unequal than that of\nincome.\"[1]\n\nIf an individual has a large income but also large expenses, the net effect of\nthat income on her or his wealth could be small or even negative.\n\nThe [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\") definition of\n_inclusive wealth_ is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural,\nhuman and physical assets.[2][3]\n\n## Data about global distribution of\nwealth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Data about global distribution of wealth\")]\n\nMain articles: [List of countries by distribution of\nwealth](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_distribution_of_wealth \"List of countries\nby distribution of wealth\") and [List of countries by income\nequality](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality \"List of countries by\nincome equality\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b8/Share_of_wealth_globally.png/220px-\nShare_of_wealth_globally.png)](/wiki/File:Share_of_wealth_globally.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Share_of_wealth_globally.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nShare of wealth globally by year[4]\n\nThe gap between the rich and poor can be illustrated by the fact that the\nthree wealthiest individuals in the world have assets that exceed those of the\npoorest 10 percent of the world's population.[5] The net worth of [the world's\nbillionaires](/wiki/Billionaire \"Billionaire\") increased from less than $1\ntrillion in 2000 to over $7 trillion in 2015 so the gap is growing up\ndramatically.\n\n### Wealth distribution\npyramid[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Wealth distribution pyramid\")]\n\nPersonal wealth varies across adults for many reasons. Some individuals with\nlittle wealth may be at early stages in their careers, with little chance or\nmotivation to accumulate assets. Others may have suffered business setbacks or\npersonal misfortunes, or live in parts of the world where opportunities for\nwealth creation are severely limited. At the other end of the spectrum, there\nare individuals who have acquired a large fortune through a combination of\ninheritance, talent, hard work or simply being in the right place at the right\ntime. The wealth pyramid below was prepared by [Credit\nSuisse](/wiki/Credit_Suisse \"Credit Suisse\") in 2013; it captures these\ndifferences in striking detail. It has a large base of low wealth holders,\nalongside upper tiers occupied by progressively fewer people. In 2013 Credit-\nsuisse estimate that 3.2 billion individuals – more than two thirds of adults\nin the world – have wealth below 10,000 USD. A further one billion(adult\npopulation) fall within the 10,000 – 100,000 USD range. While the average\nwealth holding is modest in the base and middle segments of the pyramid, their\ntotal wealth amounts to USD 40 trillion, underlining the potential for novel\nconsumer products and innovative financial services targeted at this often\nneglected segment.[6]\n\n  \nThe pyramid reveals that:\n\n  * half of the world's wealth belongs to the top 1%,\n  * top 10% of adults hold 85%, while the bottom 90% hold the remaining 15% of the world's total wealth,\n  * top 30% of adults hold 97% of the total wealth.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Distribution_of_wealth_globally.jpg)](/wiki/File:Distribution_of_wealth_globally.jpg)\n\nPyramid of global wealth distribution in 2013[6]\n\n#### Wealth distribution in\n2012[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Wealth distribution in 2012\")]\n\nAccording to the OECD in 2012 the top 0.6% of world population (consisting of\nadults with more than 1 million USD in assets) or the 42 million richest\npeople in the world held 39.3% of world wealth. The next 4.4% (311 million\npeople) held 32.3% of world wealth. The bottom 95% held 28.4% of world wealth.\nThe large gaps of the report get by the Gini index to 0.893, and are larger\nthan gaps in global income inequality, measured in 2009 at 0.38.[7] For\nexample, in 2012 the bottom 60% of the world population held same wealth in\n2012 as the people on Forbes' Richest list consisting of 1,226 richest\nbillionaires of the world.\n\n## Statistical\ndistributions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Statistical distributions\")]\n\nThere are many ways in which the distribution of wealth can be analyzed. One\nexample is to compare the wealth of the richest one percent with the wealth of\nthe median (or 50th) percentile. In many societies, the richest ten percent\ncontrol more than half of the total wealth.\n\n_[Pareto Distribution](/wiki/Pareto_distribution \"Pareto distribution\")_ has\noften been used to mathematically quantify the distribution of wealth, since\nit models a random distribution.\n\n_Wealth over people (WOP) curves_ are a visually compelling way to show the\ndistribution of wealth in a nation. WOP curves are modified distribution of\nwealth curves. The vertical and horizontal scales each show percentages from\nzero to one hundred. We imagine all the households in a nation being sorted\nfrom richest to poorest. They are then shrunk down and lined up (richest at\nthe left) along the horizontal scale. For any particular household, its point\non the curve represents how their wealth compares (as a proportion) to the\naverage wealth of the richest percentile. For any nation, the average wealth\nof the richest 1/100 of households is the topmost point on the curve (people,\n1%; wealth, 100%) or (p=1, w=100) or (1, 100). In the real world two points on\nthe WOP curve are always known before any statistics are gathered. These are\nthe topmost point (1, 100) by definition, and the rightmost point (poorest\npeople, lowest wealth) or (p=100, w=0) or (100, 0). This unfortunate rightmost\npoint is given because there are always at least one percent of households\n(incarcerated, long term illness, etc.) with no wealth at all. Given that the\ntopmost and rightmost points are fixed … our interest lies in the form of the\nWOP curve between them. There are two extreme possible forms of the curve. The\nfirst is the \"perfect communist\" WOP. It is a straight line from the leftmost\n(maximum wealth) point horizontally across the people scale to p=99. Then it\ndrops vertically to wealth = 0 at (p=100, w=0).\n\nThe other extreme is the \"perfect tyranny\" form. It starts on the left at the\nTyrant's maximum wealth of 100%. It then immediately drops to zero at p=2, and\ncontinues at zero horizontally across the rest of the people. That is, the\ntyrant and his friends (the top percentile) own all the nation's wealth. All\nother citizens are serfs or slaves. An obvious intermediate form is a straight\nline connecting the left/top point to the right/bottom point. In such a\n\"Diagonal\" society a household in the richest percentile would have just twice\nthe wealth of a family in the median (50th) percentile. Such a society is\ncompelling to many (especially the poor). In fact it is a comparison to a\ndiagonal society that is the basis for the [Gini\nvalues](/wiki/Gini_coefficient \"Gini coefficient\") used as a measure of the\ndisequity in a particular economy. These Gini values (40.8 in 2007) show the\nUnited States to be the third most dis-equitable economy of all the developed\nnations (behind Denmark and Switzerland).\n\nMore sophisticated models have also been proposed.[8]\n\n## Redistribution of wealth and public\npolicy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Redistribution of wealth and public policy\")]\n\nSee also: [Redistribution of income and\nwealth](/wiki/Redistribution_of_income_and_wealth \"Redistribution of income\nand wealth\") and [Distribution of wealth in year\n2000](/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth_in_year_2000 \"Distribution of wealth in\nyear 2000\")\n\nIn many societies, attempts have been made, through [property\nredistribution](/wiki/Property_redistribution \"Property redistribution\"),\n[taxation](/wiki/Taxation \"Taxation\"), or [regulation](/wiki/Regulation\n\"Regulation\"), to [redistribute](/wiki/Redistribution_\\(economics\\)\n\"Redistribution \\(economics\\)\") wealth, sometimes in support of the upper\nclass, and sometimes to diminish [economic\ninequality](/wiki/Economic_inequality \"Economic inequality\").\n\nExamples of this practice go back at least to the [Roman\nrepublic](/wiki/Roman_republic \"Roman republic\") in the third century B.C.,[9]\nwhen laws were passed limiting the amount of wealth or land that could be\nowned by any one family. Motivations for such limitations on wealth include\nthe desire for equality of opportunity, a fear that great wealth leads to\npolitical corruption, to the belief that limiting wealth will gain the\npolitical favor of a [voting bloc](/wiki/Voting_bloc \"Voting bloc\"), or fear\nthat extreme concentration of wealth results in rebellion.[10] Various forms\nof [socialism](/wiki/Socialism \"Socialism\") attempt to diminish the unequal\ndistribution of wealth and thus the conflicts and social problems (see image\nbelow) arising from it.[11]\n\nDuring the [Age of Reason](/wiki/Age_of_Reason \"Age of Reason\"), [Francis\nBacon](/wiki/Francis_Bacon \"Francis Bacon\") wrote \"Above all things good\npolicy is to be used so that the treasures and monies in a state be not\ngathered into a few hands… Money is like fertilizer, not good except it be\nspread.\"[12]\n\n[Communism](/wiki/Communism \"Communism\") arose as a reaction to a distribution\nof wealth in which a few lived in luxury while the masses lived in [extreme\npoverty](/wiki/Extreme_poverty \"Extreme poverty\"). In _[The Communist\nManifesto](/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto \"The Communist Manifesto\")_ ,\n[Marx](/wiki/Karl_Marx \"Karl Marx\") and [Engels](/wiki/Frederick_Engels\n\"Frederick Engels\") wrote \"[From each according to his ability, to each\naccording to his\nneed](/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_need\n\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\").\"[13]\nWhile the ideas of Marx have nominally been embraced by various states\n(Russia, Cuba, Vietnam and China in the 20th century), Marxist utopia remains\nelusive.[14]\n\nOn the other hand, the combination of [labor movements](/wiki/Labor_movements\n\"Labor movements\"), [technology](/wiki/Technology \"Technology\"), and [social\nliberalism](/wiki/Social_liberalism \"Social liberalism\") has diminished\nextreme poverty in the [developed world](/wiki/Developed_world \"Developed\nworld\") today, though extremes of wealth and poverty continue in the [Third\nWorld](/wiki/Third_World \"Third World\").[15]\n\nIn the Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 from the [World Economic\nForum](/wiki/World_Economic_Forum \"World Economic Forum\") the widening income\ndisparities come second as a worldwide risk.[16][17]\n\n## Wealth\nsurveys[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Wealth surveys\")]\n\nMany countries have national wealth surveys, for example:\n\n  * The British [Wealth and Assets Survey](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/wealth-and-assets-survey/wealth-and-assets-survey---user-guidance/index.html)\n  * The Italian [Survey on Household Income and Wealth](/wiki/Survey_on_Household_Income_and_Wealth \"Survey on Household Income and Wealth\")\n  * The euro area [Household Finance and Consumption Survey](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-research/research-networks/html/researcher_hfcn.en.html)\n  * The US [Survey of Consumer Finances](/wiki/Survey_of_Consumer_Finances \"Survey of Consumer Finances\")\n  * The Canadian [Survey of Financial Security](http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/olc-cel?lang=eng&catno=13F0026MIE2006001)\n  * The German [Armuts- und Reichtumsbericht der Bundesregierung](http://www.armuts-und-reichtumsbericht.de/DE/Startseite/start.html)\n\n## 21st\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: 21st century\")]\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, wealth was concentrated among the\n[G8](/wiki/G8 \"G8\") and Western [industrialized\nnations](/wiki/Industrialized_nations \"Industrialized nations\"), along with\nseveral [Asian](/wiki/Asia \"Asia\") and [OPEC](/wiki/OPEC \"OPEC\") nations.\n\n### Wealth\ninequality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Wealth inequality\")]\n\nA study by the [World Institute for Development Economics\nResearch](/wiki/World_Institute_for_Development_Economics_Research \"World\nInstitute for Development Economics Research\") at United Nations University\nreports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the\nyear 2000, and that the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world\ntotal. The bottom half of the world adult population owned 1% of global\nwealth.[18] Moreover, another study found that the richest 2% own more than\nhalf of global household [assets](/wiki/Asset \"Asset\").[19]\n\n### Real\nestate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Real estate\")]\n\nWhile sizeable numbers of households own no land, few have no income. For\nexample, 10% of land owners (all corporations) in [Baltimore,\nMaryland](/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland \"Baltimore, Maryland\") own 58% of the\ntaxable land value. The bottom 10% of those who own any land own less than 1%\nof the total land value.[20] This form of analysis as well as [Gini\ncoefficient](/wiki/Gini_coefficient \"Gini coefficient\") analysis has

worth in the United States (2007). The net wealth of many\npeople in the lowest 20% is negative because of debt.[22]\n\nTop 1% (35%)\n\nNext 4% (27%)\n\nNext 5% (11%)\n\nNext 10% (12%)\n\nUpper Middle 20% (11%)\n\nMiddle 20% (4%)\n\nBottom 40% (<1%)\n\nAccording to [PolitiFact](/wiki/PolitiFact \"PolitiFact\"), in 2011 the 400\nwealthiest Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans\ncombined.\"[23][24][25][26] [Inherited wealth](/wiki/Inherited_wealth\n\"Inherited wealth\") may help explain why many Americans who have become rich\nmay have had a \"substantial head start\".[27][28] In September 2012, according\nto the [Institute for Policy Studies](/wiki/Institute_for_Policy_Studies\n\"Institute for Policy Studies\"), \"over 60 percent\" of the [Forbes richest 400\nAmericans](/wiki/Forbes_400 \"Forbes 400\") \"grew up in substantial\nprivilege\".[29]\n\nIn 2007, the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the\ncountry's total wealth (excluding human capital), and the next 19% owned\n50.5%. The top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the\nbottom 80% of the population owned 15%. From 1922 to 2010, the share of the\ntop 1% varied from 19.7% to 44.2%, the big drop being associated with the drop\nin the stock market in the late 1970s. Ignoring the period where the stock\nmarket was depressed (1976–1980) and the period when the stock market was\novervalued (1929), the share of wealth of the richest 1% remained extremely\nstable, at about a third of the total wealth.[30] Financial inequality was\ngreater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population\nowning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80%\nowning 7%.[31] However, after the [Great Recession](/wiki/Great_Recession\n\"Great Recession\") which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by\nthe top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%, and that owned by the\ntop 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%. The Great Recession also caused a\ndrop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top\n1%, further widening the gap between [the 1%](/wiki/The_1%25 \"The 1%\") and\n[the 99%](/wiki/The_99%25 \"The 99%\").[22][30][31] During the economic\nexpansion between 2002 and 2007, the income of the top 1% grew 10 times faster\nthan the income of the bottom 90%. In this period 66% of total income gains\nwent to the 1%, who in 2007 had a larger share of total income than at any\ntime since 1928.\n\n[Dan Ariely](/wiki/Dan_Ariely \"Dan Ariely\") and Michael Norton show in a study\n(2011) that US citizens across the political spectrum significantly\nunderestimate the current US wealth inequality and would prefer a more\negalitarian distribution of wealth, raising questions about ideological\ndisputes over issues like taxation and welfare.[32]\n\nWealth proportion by population by year[30][33] Year | Bottom  \n99% | Top  \n1%  \n---|---|---  \n1922 | 63.3% | 36.7%  \n1929 | 55.8% | 44.2%  \n1933 | 66.7% | 33.3%  \n1939 | 63.6% | 36.4%  \n1945 | 70.2% | 29.8%  \n1949 | 72.9% | 27.1%  \n1953 | 68.8% | 31.2%  \n1962 | 68.2% | 31.8%  \n1965 | 65.6% | 34.4%  \n1969 | 68.9% | 31.1%  \n1972 | 70.9% | 29.1%  \n1976 | 80.1% | 19.9%  \n1979 | 79.5% | 20.5%  \n1981 | 75.2% | 24.8%  \n1983 | 69.1% | 30.9%  \n1986 | 68.1% | 31.9%  \n1989 | 64.3% | 35.7%  \n1992 | 62.8% | 37.2%  \n1995 | 61.5% | 38.5%  \n1998 | 61.9% | 38.1%  \n2001 | 66.6% | 33.4%  \n2004 | 65.7% | 34.3%  \n2007 | 65.4% | 34.6%  \n2010 | 64.6% | 35.4%  \n  \n## Data, charts, and\ngraphs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Distribution_of_wealth&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Data, charts, and graphs\")]\n\n  * [Wealth, Income, and Power](http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html) by G.
