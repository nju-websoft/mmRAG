The series stars [Gary\nColeman](/wiki/Gary_Coleman \"Gary Coleman\") and [Todd\nBridges](/wiki/Todd_Bridges \"Todd Bridges\") as Arnold and Willis Jackson, two\n[black](/wiki/Black \"Black\") boys from [Harlem](/wiki/Harlem \"Harlem\") who are\ntaken in by a rich white [Park Avenue](/wiki/Park_Avenue \"Park Avenue\")\nbusinessman and widower named Phillip Drummond ([Conrad\nBain](/wiki/Conrad_Bain \"Conrad Bain\")) and his daughter Kimberly ([Dana\nPlato](/wiki/Dana_Plato \"Dana Plato\")), for whom their deceased mother\npreviously worked.[2][3] During the first season and first half of the second\nseason, [Charlotte Rae](/wiki/Charlotte_Rae \"Charlotte Rae\") also starred as\nthe Drummonds' housekeeper, Mrs. Edna Garrett (who ultimately spun off into\nher own successful sitcom, _[The Facts of\nLife](/wiki/The_Facts_of_Life_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Facts of Life \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_).\n\nThe series made stars out of child actors Gary Coleman, Todd Bridges and Dana\nPlato and became known for the \"[very special\nepisodes](/wiki/Very_special_episode \"Very special episode\")\" in which serious\nissues such as racism, illegal drug use, hitchhiking, kidnapping and child\nsexual abuse were dramatically explored. The lives of these stars were later\nplagued by legal troubles and drug addiction, with Plato and Coleman later\nsuffering early deaths.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Seasons 1–4 (1978–82)\n    * 1.2 Seasons 5–6 (1982–84)\n    * 1.3 Season 7 (1984–85)\n    * 1.4 Season 8 (1985–86)\n  * 2 Cast\n    * 2.1 Supporting characters\n  * 3 Episodes\n    * 3.1 Very special episodes\n    * 3.2 Spin-off and crossovers\n    * 3.3 Later appearances as the characters\n    * 3.4 Additional catchphrase references and appearances in popular culture\n  * 4 After _Diff 'rent Strokes_ ended\n    * 4.1 Gary Coleman\n    * 4.2 Dana Plato\n    * 4.3 Todd Bridges\n  * 5 Docudramas\n  * 6 DVD releases\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nIn pre-production, the original proposed title was _45 Minutes from Harlem_\n(even though Harlem is only ten or fifteen minutes away from the Drummond\nresidence by subway or taxi).[4] The series was originally devised as a joint\nvehicle for _[Maude](/wiki/Maude_\\(TV_series\\) \"Maude \\(TV series\\)\")_ co-star\nConrad Bain (after _Maude_ had abruptly finished production in 1978), and\nchild actor Gary Coleman, who had caught producers' attentions after appearing\nin a number of commercials.\n\nThe sitcom starred Coleman as Arnold Jackson and Todd Bridges as his older\nbrother, Willis. They played two children from a poor section of Harlem whose\ndeceased mother previously worked for rich widower Philip Drummond (Conrad\nBain), who eventually adopted them. They lived in a penthouse with Drummond,\nhis daughter Kimberly (Dana Plato), and their maid.\n\nThere were three maids during the sitcom's run: [Edna\nGarrett](/wiki/Edna_Garrett \"Edna Garrett\") ([Charlotte\nRae](/wiki/Charlotte_Rae \"Charlotte Rae\")), Adelaide Brubaker ([Nedra\nVolz](/wiki/Nedra_Volz \"Nedra Volz\")), and Pearl Gallagher ([Mary Jo\nCatlett](/wiki/Mary_Jo_Catlett \"Mary Jo Catlett\")). They lived in the\nPenthouse Suite at 697 [Park Avenue](/wiki/Park_Avenue_\\(Manhattan\\) \"Park\nAvenue \\(Manhattan\\)\") in New York City. As Arnold, Coleman popularized the\n[catchphrase](/wiki/Catchphrase \"Catchphrase\") \"What'chu talkin' 'bout,\nWillis?\" The ending often varied, depending on whom he was addressing. Early\nepisodes addressed typical issues in a family. Later episodes at times though\nfocused on drug abuse, alcoholism, hitchhiking, and crime, among other issues.\n\n### Seasons 1–4\n(1978–82)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Seasons 1–4 \\(1978–82\\)\")]\n\nIn Season 1, Charlotte Rae appeared in every episode as Edna Garrett, but she\ndeparted the show partway through the second season to star in her own spin-\noff, _The Facts of Life_. Following Rae's departure, Nedra Volz took over as\nthe housekeeper, Adelaide Brubaker. Although she was not part of the official\nmain cast and not added to the opening credits, Volz appeared as a frequent\nsemi-regular character.\n\n### Seasons 5–6\n(1982–84)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Seasons 5–6 \\(1982–84\\)\")]\n\nIn Season 5, Mary Jo Catlett portrayed Pearl Gallagher, the last of the three\nmaids, and joined the cast as a series regular. Pearl appeared in almost every\nepisode until the final season. Midway through Season 6, Dana Plato became\npregnant and approached the producers of the show to include her pregnancy.\nInitially they agreed to add it, but they later decided not to add the\npregnancy, with Plato's publicized brushes with substance abuse contributing\nto this decision, resulting in her dismissal from the series.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nPlato's character, Kimberly, was written out of the story lines with the\nexplanation that she moved to Paris to study for a couple of years. Plato did\nnot appear as a regular cast member in the final two seasons of the series,\nbut she made several guest appearances.\n\nAt the same time, ratings were beginning to fall, so new characters were added\nto open up future storylines. [Dixie Carter](/wiki/Dixie_Carter \"Dixie\nCarter\") and [Danny Cooksey](/wiki/Danny_Cooksey \"Danny Cooksey\") portrayed\nrecently divorced television aerobics instructor Margaret \"Maggie\" McKinney,\nand her son, Sam McKinney.[5] Carter was introduced midway into the sixth\nseason; after she left for [California](/wiki/California \"California\"),\nDrummond and the family took off after her, during a two-part trip in February\n1984, a storyline which also introduced Sam.\n\nPhillip proposed to Maggie, and they married. Several past characters attended\nthe wedding ceremony including Dudley, Aunt Sophia, Adelaide and Mrs. Garrett.\n\n### Season 7\n(1984–85)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Season 7 \\(1984–85\\)\")]\n\nIn the seventh season, Dixie Carter and Danny Cooksey were added to the\nopening credits (with Carter getting special \"and\" billing, last in the\norder), and many new areas and ideas were explored in the storylines, as\nviewers now got to see Philip as a happily married man. Dana Plato was no\nlonger appearing as a main cast member, because of her pregnancy in real life.\nThe producers felt that the pregnancy wouldn't be acceptable, so she was\ndropped from the show and returned for the season finale _A Special Friend_ as\na guest star. Also, since there was a new fresh-faced kid in the house with\nSam, Arnold now had his own little sidekick and was happy to be a \"big\nbrother\" for a change, and with Willis being dropped into the background\nslightly, this new brotherly duo took center stage for many storylines. In the\nseason, Todd Bridges was continuing the show as a main cast member, but\ndeveloped absences in several episodes. Additionally, stories focusing on\nArnold's school life (featured occasionally in many previous seasons) were\ndelved into much more. The ratings did not improve to NBC's hopes. Dixie\nCarter departed at the end of the seventh season and was replaced with Mary\nAnn Mobley in the eighth season.\n\n### Season 8\n(1985–86)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Season 8 \\(1985–86\\)\")]\n\nIn the spring of 1985, NBC canceled the series because of poor ratings. ABC\npicked up the series for an eighth season, and aired it Friday nights. In this\nseason, Mary Ann Mobley replaced Dixie Carter as Maggie McKinney Drummond.\nMobley, who had previously played an unrelated, one-off love interest of\nDrummond's in the second-season episode \"Teacher's Pet\", was considered for\nMaggie when the role was created. But she was not initially chosen in part due\nto age disparity between her and Conrad Bain.[6]\n\nABC canceled the series after 19 episodes, and aired its final episode on\nMarch 7, 1986. The show returned to ABC's schedule in June for three months of\nsummer reruns, which ended on August 30, 1986. The final season ranked 76th\nout of 106 shows, and averaged an 11.5 household rating.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Diff'rent Strokes\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Diff%27rent_Strokes_characters \"List of Diff'rent\nStrokes characters\")\n\n  * [Conrad Bain](/wiki/Conrad_Bain \"Conrad Bain\") as Phillip Drummond\n  * [Gary Coleman](/wiki/Gary_Coleman \"Gary Coleman\") as Arnold Jackson\n  * [Todd Bridges](/wiki/Todd_Bridges \"Todd Bridges\") as Willis Jackson\n  * [Dana Plato](/wiki/Dana_Plato \"Dana Plato\") as Kimberly Drummond (1978–84, 1985–86 recurring)\n  * [Charlotte Rae](/wiki/Charlotte_Rae \"Charlotte Rae\") as Edna Garrett (1978–79)\n  * [Nedra Volz](/wiki/Nedra_Volz \"Nedra Volz\") as Adelaide Brubaker (1980–84)\n  * [Janet Jackson](/wiki/Janet_Jackson \"Janet Jackson\") as Charlene DuPrey (1980–84 recurring)\n  * [Dody Goodman](/wiki/Dody_Goodman \"Dody Goodman\") as Sophia Drummond (1981–84 recurring)\n  * [Shavar Ross](/wiki/Shavar_Ross \"Shavar Ross\") as Dudley Johnson (1980–86 recurring)\n  * [Le Tari](/wiki/Le_Tari \"Le Tari\") as Ted Ramsey (1980–84 recurring)\n  * [Mary Jo Catlett](/wiki/Mary_Jo_Catlett \"Mary Jo Catlett\") as Pearl Gallagher (1982–86)\n  * [Rosalind Chao](/wiki/Rosalind_Chao \"Rosalind Chao\") as Miss Chung (1981–83 recurring)\n  * [Steven Mond](/wiki/Steven_Mond \"Steven Mond\") as Robbie Jason (1980–85 recurring)\n  * [Dixie Carter](/wiki/Dixie_Carter \"Dixie Carter\") as Maggie McKinney Drummond #1 (1984–85)\n  * [Mary Ann Mobley](/wiki/Mary_Ann_Mobley \"Mary Ann Mobley\") as Maggie McKinney Drummond #2 (1985–86) and as Ms. Osbourne\n  * [Danny Cooksey](/wiki/Danny_Cooksey \"Danny Cooksey\") as Sam McKinney (1984–86)\n  * [Jason Hervey](/wiki/Jason_Hervey \"Jason Hervey\") as Charlie (1985–86 recurring)\n  * Nikki Swasey as Lisa Hayes (1982–86 recurring)\n\nPhillip Drummond is the only character to appear in every episode of the\nseries. Arnold Jackson missed five episodes. Two from the 1981–82 season,\n\"First Day Blues\" and \"The Team\". He then missed three episodes from the\n1984–85 season, \"The Gymnasts\", \"Sam Adopts a Grandparent\" and \"Baseball\nBlues\".\n\n### Supporting\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Supporting characters\")]\n\nOutside of the Drummond household, there were a large number of supporting\ncharacters seen over the years. Phillip's slightly dotty sister Sophia ([Dody\nGoodman](/wiki/Dody_Goodman \"Dody Goodman\")) was regularly seen in the fourth\nseason, playing matchmaker for her brother in hopes of getting Philip to marry\nagain. Dudley Johnson ([Shavar Ross](/wiki/Shavar_Ross \"Shavar Ross\")) was\nArnold's new best friend, who, like Arnold, was also adopted, with whom he\nshared many memorable childhood scrapes. Some of these were important or\nserious storylines under the \"very special episode\" heading, which _Diff 'rent\nStrokes_ popularized (see below). Ted Ramsey ([Le Tari](/wiki/Le_Tari \"Le\nTari\")) was Dudley's adoptive father, who turned up occasionally.\n\nIn the third season, [Janet Jackson](/wiki/Janet_Jackson \"Janet Jackson\")\nplayed Willis' girlfriend Charlene DuPrey. She was a frequent recurring\ncharacter until Season 6, when Charlene and Willis decided to [break\nup](/wiki/Break_up \"Break up\"), but remain friends.\n\nOther classmates and friends of Arnold seen over time included Robbie Jason\n([Steven Mond](/wiki/Steven_Mond \"Steven Mond\")) and snobby Lisa Hayes (Nikki\nSwasey), who initially was sweet on Arnold, but later came to despise him,\nleading to hatred between the pair and many squabbles. Miss Chung ([Rosalind\nChao](/wiki/Rosalind_Chao \"Rosalind Chao\")) was Arnold's teacher. In the fall\nof 1985, when the series moved to ABC, Arnold, Dudley and Lisa entered high\nschool, where they gained a new friend in Charlie ([Jason\nHervey](/wiki/Jason_Hervey \"Jason Hervey\")).\n\nAn oft-mentioned character, spanning the entire show's run, was \"The Gooch\", a\nnotorious bully at Arnold's school. First mentioned in the first-season\nepisode \"The Fight\", which revolves around his bullying of Arnold, his name is\nmentioned in numerous episodes (and his bullying of Arnold returned as the\ncenter of several plots), with Arnold's frequent descriptions of him as a\nburly, troublesome brute, forever looking for trouble but not very\nintelligent, but the character never actually appeared on screen. In season 7,\nafter years of harassing Arnold (and later Sam), the Gooch was finally\ndefeated by Arnold's neighbor and nemesis Carmella.\n\n##\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Diff'rent Strokes\nepisodes](/wiki/List_of_Diff%27rent_Strokes_episodes \"List of Diff'rent\nStrokes episodes\")\n\nSeason | Episodes | Originally aired | [Nielsen ratings](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings \"Nielsen ratings\")[7]  \n---|---|---|---  \nFirst aired | Last aired | Network | Rank | Rating | Tied with  \n| 1 | 24 | November 3, 1978 (1978-11-03) | May 4, 1979 (1979-05-04) | [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\") | 27 | 19.9 | N/A  \n| 2 | 26 | September 21, 1979 (1979-09-21) | March 26, 1980 (1980-03-26) | 26 | 20.3 | N/A  \n| 3 | 22 | November 12, 1980 (1980-11-12) | May 13, 1981 (1981-05-13) | 17 | 20.7 | _[Fantasy Island](/wiki/Fantasy_Island_\\(1977_TV_series\\) \"Fantasy Island \\(1977 TV series\\)\")_  \n_[Trapper John, M.D.](/wiki/Trapper_John,_M.D. \"Trapper John, M.D.\")_  \n| 4 | 26 | October 29, 1981 (1981-10-29) | May 20, 1982 (1982-05-20) | N/A | N/A | N/A  \n| 5 | 24 | October 2, 1982 (1982-10-02) | May 14, 1983 (1983-05-14) | N/A | N/A | N/A  \n| 6 | 24 | October 1, 1983 (1983-10-01) | May 12, 1984 (1984-05-12) | N/A | N/A | N/A  \n| 7 | 24 | September 29, 1984 (1984-09-29) | May 4, 1985 (1985-05-04) | N/A | N/A | N/A  \n| 8 | 19 | September 27, 1985 (1985-09-27) | March 7, 1986 (1986-03-07) | [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\") | N/A | N/A | N/A  \n  \n### Very special\nepisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Very special episodes\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Nancyreagandiffrentstrokes.jpg/350px-\nNancyreagandiffrentstrokes.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nancyreagandiffrentstrokes.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nancyreagandiffrentstrokes.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNancy Reagan on the set of _Diff 'rent Strokes_\n\n_Diff 'rent Strokes_ was also known for its many \"very special episodes\", most\nnotably an anti-drug episode (\"The Reporter\", in Season 5) that featured\n[First Lady](/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States \"First Lady of the United\nStates\") [Nancy Reagan](/wiki/Nancy_Reagan \"Nancy Reagan\"), who promoted her\n\"[Just Say No](/wiki/Just_Say_No \"Just Say No\")\" campaign, and \"The Bicycle\nMan\", a two-part episode that guest starred [Gordon Jump](/wiki/Gordon_Jump\n\"Gordon Jump\") as a [pedophile](/wiki/Pedophilia \"Pedophilia\") who lures\nArnold and Dudley into his bicycle shop and attempts to\n[molest](/wiki/Child_molestation \"Child molestation\") them.\n\nAnother episode involved a [con artist](/wiki/Con_artist \"Con artist\") (played\nby [Whitman Mayo](/wiki/Whitman_Mayo \"Whitman Mayo\")) posing as a relative of\nArnold and Willis in an attempt to get access to the inheritance they were\nleft by a former neighbor. Another episode involved Kimberly's new boyfriend\nRoger not allowing his sister to go to their school's costume ball with Willis\nbecause he is African-American.\n\nIn an episode on the dangers of [hitchhiking](/wiki/Hitchhiking\n\"Hitchhiking\"), Kimberly and Arnold (who were out in the cold weather and\ndidn't have money for cab or bus fare) were abducted by a serial kidnapper-\nrapist (played by Woody Eney), who initially acted as a good Samaritan by\ngiving the two of them a ride, and inviting them to his apartment. After the\nman's true nature became known, Arnold escaped to look for help and the man\nnearly raped Kimberly before the police arrived to arrest him. At the end of\nthe episode, Conrad Bain (in an out of character\n[PSA](/wiki/Public_Service_Announcement \"Public Service Announcement\")) spoke\nabout what to do if real life situations as the one portrayed on the show were\nto occur.\n\nTwo notable episodes dealt with the consequences of\n[alcoholism](/wiki/Alcoholism \"Alcoholism\"). In season 5, Willis moves out of\nthe penthouse to live with a friend who abuses alcohol. In season 7, Arnold\nmust deal with a classmate whom he catches drinking a thermos of alcohol in\nthe school bathroom.\n\nIn the final season (when the sitcom moved from NBC to ABC), the one-hour\nseason opener revolved around Sam being kidnapped by a bereaved father (played\nby [Royce D. Applegate](/wiki/Royce_D._Applegate \"Royce D. Applegate\")) hoping\nto replace his own dead son.\n\nIn other notable episodes, the family discovered that Kimberly was suffering\nfrom [bulimia](/wiki/Bulimia \"Bulimia\"). In another episode, Arnold and Sam\nmet Karen, a street performer. After a performance, she has an [epileptic\nseizure](/wiki/Epileptic_seizure \"Epileptic seizure\"), and Sam is scared\nthinking she's dying. The boys then feel uncomfortable around her, and when\nthey begin making jokes about her seizures, they find out that housekeeper\nPearl herself has epilepsy, but unlike Karen controls her seizures by taking\nmedication.\n\n### Spin-off and\ncrossovers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diff%27rent_Strokes&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Spin-off and crossovers\")]\n\n_The Facts of Life_ (1979–88) is a [spin-off](/wiki/Spin-off_\\(media\\) \"Spin-\noff \\(media\\)\") of _Diff 'rent Strokes_ featuring Drummond's former maid Mrs.\nGarrett (Charlotte Rae), who had accepted a job as the house-mother for a\ndormitory at an all-girls private school that Kimberly was attending. In a\nlate first-season episode of _Strokes_ (which served as the \"[backdoor\npilot](/wiki/Backdoor_pilot \"Backdoor pilot\")\" of _Facts_), Mrs. Garrett took\nKimberly to the school with the intent of helping her sew costumes for a\nschool play. While there, Mrs. Garrett met Kimberly's classmates and was\noffered the job as \"dorm mother\". She declines in this episode, but come fall,\nclearly had a change of heart. The _Diff 'rent Strokes_ cast appeared in the\nfirst episode of _The Facts of Life_ (at one point, Drummond asks Mrs. Garrett\n\"Are you sure we can't change your mind to come back to us?\").
