George and Elizabeth had moved west to Tennessee\nafter his service in the American Revolution.\n\nIn 1805, George Farragut accepted a position at the U.S. port of [New\nOrleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\"). He traveled there first and his\nfamily followed, in a 1,700-mile (2,700 km) flatboat adventure aided by hired\nrivermen, the then four-year-old Farragut's first voyage. The family was still\nliving in New Orleans when Elizabeth died of [yellow fever](/wiki/Yellow_fever\n\"Yellow fever\"). His father made plans to place the young children with\nfriends and family who could better care for them.\n\nDavid's birth name was James. In 1808, after his mother's death, he agreed to\nlive with [David Porter](/wiki/David_Porter_\\(naval_officer\\) \"David Porter\n\\(naval officer\\)\"), a naval officer whose father had been friends with\nJames's father,[11] as Porter's foster son. In 1812, James adopted the name\n\"David\" in honor of his foster father, with whom he went to sea late in 1810.\nDavid Farragut grew up in a naval family, as the foster brother of future\n[Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") admiral, [David\nDixon Porter](/wiki/David_Dixon_Porter \"David Dixon Porter\"), and\n[Commodore](/wiki/Commodore_\\(United_States\\) \"Commodore \\(United States\\)\")\n[William D.

This included service in several wars, most notably\nduring the [American Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil\nWar\"), where he gained fame for winning several decisive naval battles.\n\n### War of 1812[[edit](/w/index.php?title=David_Farragut&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: War of 1812\")]\n\nThrough the influence of his adoptive father, Farragut was commissioned a\nmidshipman in the United States Navy on December 17, 1810, at the age of\nnine.[12][note 1] A [prize master](/wiki/Prize_ship \"Prize ship\") by the age\nof 12, Farragut fought in the [War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\"),\nserving under Captain David Porter.

In\n1824, he was placed in command of [USS _Ferret_](/wiki/USS_Ferret_\\(1822\\)\n\"USS Ferret \\(1822\\)\"), which was his first command of a U.S. naval\nvessel.[17] He served in the [Mosquito Fleet](/wiki/Mosquito_Fleet \"Mosquito\nFleet\"), a fleet of ships fitted out to fight pirates in the [Caribbean\nSea](/wiki/Caribbean_Sea \"Caribbean Sea\"). After learning his old captain,\nCommodore Porter, would be commander of the fleet, he asked for, and received,\norders to serve aboard _Greyhound_ , one of the smaller vessels, commanded by\nJohn Porter, brother of David Porter. On February 14, 1823, the fleet set sail\nfor the West Indies where, for the next six months, they would drive the\npirates off the sea, and rout them from their hiding places in among the\nislands.[18] He was executive officer aboard the _Experiment_ during its\ncampaign in the West Indies fighting pirates.[19]\n\n### Mexican–American\nWar[[edit](/w/index.php?title=David_Farragut&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Mexican–American War\")]\n\nIn 1847, Farragut, now a [commander](/wiki/Commander_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Commander \\(United States\\)\"), took command of the [sloop-of-\nwar](/wiki/Sloop-of-war \"Sloop-of-war\") [USS\n_Saratoga_](/wiki/USS_Saratoga_\\(1842\\) \"USS Saratoga \\(1842\\)\") when she was\nrecommissioned at [Norfolk Navy Yard](/wiki/Norfolk_Navy_Yard \"Norfolk Navy\nYard\") in [Norfolk](/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia \"Norfolk, Virginia\"),\n[Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\").

About two weeks later, Farragut began a round-trip voyage to carry\ndispatches to [Tabasco](/wiki/Tabasco \"Tabasco\"), returning to Veracruz on\nAugust 11, 1847. On September 1, 1847, Farragut and _Saratoga_ returned to\nblockade duty off Tuxpan, remaining there for two months despite a [yellow\nfever](/wiki/Yellow_fever \"Yellow fever\") outbreak on board.

Farragut, c. 1863\n\nThough living in [Norfolk, Virginia](/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia \"Norfolk,\nVirginia\"), prior to the American Civil War, Farragut made it clear to all who\nknew him that he regarded secession as [treason](/wiki/Treason \"Treason\").\nJust before the war's outbreak, Farragut moved with his Virginian-born wife to\n[Hastings-on-Hudson](/wiki/Hastings-on-Hudson,_New_York \"Hastings-on-Hudson,\nNew York\"), a small town just outside New York City.[9][23]\n\nHe offered his services to the Union, and was initially given a seat on the\nNaval Retirement Board. Offered a command by his foster brother, David Dixon\nPorter, for a special assignment, he hesitated upon learning the target might\nbe Norfolk. As he had friends and relatives living there, he was relieved to\nlearn the target was changed to his former childhood home of New Orleans. The\nnavy had some doubts about Farragut's loyalty to the Union because of his\nSouthern birth as well as that of his wife. Porter argued on his behalf, and\nFarragut was accepted for the major role of attacking New Orleans.[23]\n\nFarragut was appointed under secret instructions on February 3, 1862, to\ncommand the [Gulf Blockading Squadron](/wiki/West_Gulf_Blockading_Squadron\n\"West Gulf Blockading Squadron\"), sailing from [Hampton\nRoads](/wiki/Hampton_Roads \"Hampton Roads\") on the screw\n[steamer](/wiki/Steamship \"Steamship\") [USS\n_Hartford_](/wiki/USS_Hartford_\\(1858\\) \"USS Hartford \\(1858\\)\"), bearing 25\nguns, which he made his [flagship](/wiki/Flagship \"Flagship\"), accompanied by\na fleet of 17 ships. He reached the mouth of the [Mississippi\nRiver](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\"), near Confederate forts\n[St. Philip](/wiki/Fort_St._Philip \"Fort St. Philip\") and\n[Jackson](/wiki/Fort_Jackson,_Louisiana \"Fort Jackson, Louisiana\"), situated\nopposite one another along the banks of the river, with a combined armament of\nmore than 100 heavy guns and a complement of 700 men. Now aware of Farragut's\napproach, the Confederates had amassed a fleet of 16 gunboats just outside New\nOrleans.[24]\n\nOn April 18, Farragut ordered the mortar boats, under the command of Porter,\nto commence bombardment on the two forts, inflicting considerable damage, but\nnot enough to compel the Confederates into surrender. After two days of [heavy\nbombardment](/wiki/Battle_of_Forts_Jackson_and_St._Philip \"Battle of Forts\nJackson and St. Philip\"), Farragut ran past forts Jackson and St. Philip and\nthe [Chalmette](/wiki/Chalmette,_Louisiana \"Chalmette, Louisiana\") batteries\nto take the city and port of [New\nOrleans](/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans_\\(Civil_War\\) \"Battle of New Orleans\n\\(Civil War\\)\") on April 29, a decisive event in the war.[25]\n\nCongress honored him by creating the rank of [rear\nadmiral](/wiki/Rear_admiral_\\(United_States\\) \"Rear admiral \\(United\nStates\\)\") on July 16, 1862, a rank never before used in the U.S. Navy. Before\nthis time, the American Navy had resisted the rank of admiral, preferring the\nterm \"flag officer\", to distinguish the rank from the traditions of the\nEuropean navies.\n\nLater that year, Farragut passed the batteries defending [Vicksburg,\nMississippi](/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi \"Vicksburg, Mississippi\"), but had\nno success there. A makeshift [Confederate](/wiki/Confederate_States_Navy\n\"Confederate States Navy\") [ironclad](/wiki/Ironclad \"Ironclad\") forced his\nflotilla of 38 ships to withdraw in July 1862.\n\nWhile an aggressive commander, Farragut was not always cooperative. At the\n[Siege of Port Hudson](/wiki/Siege_of_Port_Hudson \"Siege of Port Hudson\"), the\nplan was that Farragut's flotilla would pass by the guns of the\n[Confederate](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of\nAmerica\") stronghold with the help of a diversionary land attack by the [Army\nof the Gulf](/wiki/Army_of_the_Gulf \"Army of the Gulf\"), commanded by General\n[Nathaniel Banks](/wiki/Nathaniel_Banks \"Nathaniel Banks\"), to commence at\n8:00 a.m. on March 15, 1863. Farragut unilaterally decided to move the\ntimetable up to 9:00 p.m. on March 14, and initiated his run past the guns\nbefore Union ground forces were in position. The consequently uncoordinated\nattack allowed the Confederates to concentrate on Farragut's flotilla and\ninflict heavy damage to his warships.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/DavidFarragutonUSSHartford.jpg/220px-\nDavidFarragutonUSSHartford.jpg)](/wiki/File:DavidFarragutonUSSHartford.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:DavidFarragutonUSSHartford.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFarragut on board _Hartford_\n\nFarragut's battle group was forced to retreat with only two ships able to pass\nthe heavy cannon of the Confederate bastion. After surviving the gauntlet,\nFarragut played no further part in the battle for [Port\nHudson](/wiki/Port_Hudson,_Louisiana \"Port Hudson, Louisiana\"), and General\nBanks was left to continue the siege without the advantage of naval support.\nThe [Union Army](/wiki/Union_Army \"Union Army\") made two major attacks on the\nfort; both were repulsed with heavy losses. Farragut's flotilla was\nsplintered, yet was able to blockade the mouth of the [Red\nRiver](/wiki/Red_River_of_the_South \"Red River of the South\") with the two\nremaining warships; he could not efficiently patrol the section of the\nMississippi between Port Hudson and Vicksburg. Farragut's decision proved\ncostly to the Union Navy and the Union Army, which suffered its highest\ncasualty rate of the war at Port Hudson.\n\n[Vicksburg surrendered](/wiki/Siege_of_Vicksburg \"Siege of Vicksburg\") on July\n4, 1863, leaving Port Hudson as the last remaining Confederate stronghold on\nthe Mississippi River.
