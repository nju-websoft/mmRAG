Pepper's Lonely\nHearts Club Band\")_. It was written by [John Lennon](/wiki/John_Lennon \"John\nLennon\") and [Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\"), and\nintended as the album's featured vocal for drummer [Ringo\nStarr](/wiki/Ringo_Starr \"Ringo Starr\"). The group recorded the song towards\nthe end of the sessions for _Sgt. Pepper_ , with Starr singing as the\ncharacter \"[Billy Shears](/wiki/Billy_Shears \"Billy Shears\")\".\n\nA subsequent recording of the track by [Joe Cocker](/wiki/Joe_Cocker \"Joe\nCocker\") became a hit single in 1968 and an anthem for the\n[Woodstock](/wiki/Woodstock \"Woodstock\") era.[2] In 1978, the Beatles'\nrecording, paired with \"[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club\nBand](/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band_\\(song\\) \"Sgt. Pepper's\nLonely Hearts Club Band \\(song\\)\")\", was reissued as a single, and peaked at\nnumber 63 in Britain and number 71 in the United States. Starr has regularly\nperformed the song in concert as a solo artist. \"With a Little Help from My\nFriends\" was ranked number 311 on _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone\n\"Rolling Stone\")_ 's list of the [500 Greatest Songs of All\nTime](/wiki/500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Origins\n  * 2 Recording\n  * 3 Personnel\n  * 4 Live performances\n  * 5 Cover versions\n  * 6 Joe Cocker version\n  * 7 In popular culture\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Origins\n\nLennon and McCartney finished writing this song in mid-March 1967,[3] written\nspecifically as Starr's track for the album. McCartney said: \"It was pretty\nmuch co-written, John and I doing a work song for Ringo, a little craft job.\"\nIn 1970 Lennon stated: \"Paul had the line about 'a little help from my\nfriends.' He had some kind of structure for it, and we wrote it pretty well\nfifty-fifty from his original idea.\", but in 1980 Lennon said: \"This is Paul,\nwith a little help from me. 'What do you see when you turn out the light/ I\ncan't tell you, but I know it's mine...' is mine.\"[4] It was briefly called\n\"Bad Finger Boogie\" (later the inspiration for the band name\n[Badfinger](/wiki/Badfinger \"Badfinger\")),[5] supposedly because Lennon\ncomposed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having hurt his\nforefinger.\n\nThe song begins with the applause from the end of [Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts\nClub Band](/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band_\\(song\\) \"Sgt.\nPepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band \\(song\\)\").\n\nLennon and McCartney deliberately wrote a tune with a limited range – except\nfor the last note, which McCartney worked closely with Starr to achieve.\nSpeaking in the _[Anthology](/wiki/The_Beatles_Anthology \"The Beatles\nAnthology\")_ , Starr explained that he insisted on changing the first line —\nwhich originally was \"What would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you\nthrow ripe tomatoes at me?\" — so that fans would not throw tomatoes at him\nshould he perform it live. (In the early days, after [George\nHarrison](/wiki/George_Harrison \"George Harrison\") made a passing comment that\nhe liked [jelly babies](/wiki/Jelly_babies \"Jelly babies\"), the group was\nshowered with them at all of their live performances.)[6]\n\nThe song's composition is unusually well documented, as [Hunter\nDavies](/wiki/Hunter_Davies \"Hunter Davies\") was present and described the\nwriting process in the Beatles' official biography.\n\nThe song is partly in the form of a conversation in which the other three\nBeatles sing a question — e.g. \"Would you believe in a love at first sight?\"\nwhere Starr answers, \"Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.\"\n\n## Recording\n\nThe Beatles began recording the song on 29 March 1967, the day before they\nposed for the _Sgt. Pepper_ album cover. They recorded 10 takes of the song,\nwrapping up sessions at 5:45 in the morning.[7] The backing track consisted of\nStarr on drums, McCartney playing piano, Harrison playing lead guitar and\nLennon beating a cowbell. At dawn, Starr trudged up the stairs to head home –\nbut the other Beatles cajoled him into doing his lead vocal then and there,\nstanding around the microphone for moral support.[4] The following day they\nadded tambourine, backing vocals, bass and more electric guitar.[7]\n\n## Personnel\n\nAccording to [Ian MacDonald](/wiki/Ian_MacDonald \"Ian MacDonald\"), except\nwhere noted:[8]\n\n  * [Ringo Starr](/wiki/Ringo_Starr \"Ringo Starr\") – lead vocal, drums\n  * [John Lennon](/wiki/John_Lennon \"John Lennon\") – backing vocal, [cowbell](/wiki/Cowbell_\\(instrument\\) \"Cowbell \\(instrument\\)\")\n  * [Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\") – backing vocal, piano, bass guitar\n  * [George Harrison](/wiki/George_Harrison \"George Harrison\") – backing vocal, rhythm[9] and lead guitars\n  * [George Martin](/wiki/George_Martin \"George Martin\") – [Hammond organ](/wiki/Hammond_organ \"Hammond organ\")\n\n## Live performances\n\nTo date, Starr has closed every concert performed by each version of his [All-\nStarr Band](/wiki/Ringo_Starr_%26_His_All-Starr_Band \"Ringo Starr & His All-\nStarr Band\") with this song. After he is done singing, Starr tells the\naudience \"Peace and love...peace and love is the only way...and good night\",\nthen walks off the stage. Since 2008, the band segued right into \"[Give Peace\na Chance](/wiki/Give_Peace_a_Chance \"Give Peace a Chance\")\", during which\nStarr comes back onstage, then walks off again.\n\nStarr performed the song with [George Harrison](/wiki/George_Harrison \"George\nHarrison\"), [Eric Clapton](/wiki/Eric_Clapton \"Eric Clapton\"), [Bruce\nSpringsteen](/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen \"Bruce Springsteen\"), [George\nMichael](/wiki/George_Michael \"George Michael\"), [Phil\nCollins](/wiki/Phil_Collins \"Phil Collins\"), [Elton John](/wiki/Elton_John\n\"Elton John\"), and many others at the 1987 [Prince's\nTrust](/wiki/Prince%27s_Trust \"Prince's Trust\") Concert at [Wembley\nArena](/wiki/Wembley_Arena \"Wembley Arena\"), London.[10]\n\nMcCartney and Starr performed this song for the first time together at the\n[David Lynch Foundation](/wiki/David_Lynch_Foundation \"David Lynch\nFoundation\") Benefit Concert in the [Radio City Music\nHall](/wiki/Radio_City_Music_Hall \"Radio City Music Hall\"), New York on 4\nApril 2009. McCartney and Starr also performed the song together on \"The Night\nThat Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles\", a commemorative show on\n27 January 2014, that marked 50 years since the band's first appearance on\n_The Ed Sullivan Show_.[11], then again in 2015 at Ringo Starr's induction in\nthe Rock'n Roll Hall of Fame.[12]\n\n## Cover versions\n\nThere have been at least 50 cover versions of the song[13] and it has achieved\nthe number one position on the British singles charts three times: by [Joe\nCocker](/wiki/Joe_Cocker \"Joe Cocker\") in 1968,[14] [Wet Wet\nWet](/wiki/Wet_Wet_Wet \"Wet Wet Wet\") in 1988,[15] and by [Sam &\nMark](/wiki/Sam_%26_Mark \"Sam & Mark\") in 2004. [Chris\nClark](/wiki/Chris_Clark_\\(singer\\) \"Chris Clark \\(singer\\)\"), the first white\nfemale recording artist to have an album released on [Motown](/wiki/Motown\n\"Motown\"), recorded the song for her second album, 1969's _[CC Rides\nAgain](/wiki/CC_Rides_Again \"CC Rides Again\")_.\n\nThe song was also covered by [Mumford & Sons](/wiki/Mumford_%26_Sons \"Mumford\n& Sons\") and [Dawes](/wiki/Dawes_\\(band\\) \"Dawes \\(band\\)\") on the Tour of Two\nHalves in 2012.[16] Mumford & Sons also covered the song to close out their\nheadline set at the 2013 [Glastonbury Festival](/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival\n\"Glastonbury Festival\") with [Vampire Weekend](/wiki/Vampire_Weekend \"Vampire\nWeekend\"), [The Vaccines](/wiki/The_Vaccines \"The Vaccines\"), [First Aid\nKit](/wiki/First_Aid_Kit_\\(band\\) \"First Aid Kit \\(band\\)\"), and [The\nStaves](/wiki/The_Staves \"The Staves\") on 30 June 2013.[17] For the 1981\ncompilation _[Rarities](/wiki/Rarities_\\(The_Beach_Boys_album\\) \"Rarities\n\\(The Beach Boys album\\)\")_ , [the Beach Boys](/wiki/The_Beach_Boys \"The Beach\nBoys\") released their version recorded in 1967,[18] while in 2015, [Brian\nWilson](/wiki/Brian_Wilson \"Brian Wilson\") named it one of his favorite\nsongs,[19] and in that year German rock band [Bonfire](/wiki/Bonfire_\\(band\\)\n\"Bonfire \\(band\\)\"), with new frontman [David Reece](/wiki/David_Reece \"David\nReece\"), recorded their version for the album _Glörious_.\n\n[Widespread Panic](/wiki/Widespread_Panic \"Widespread Panic\") has performed\nthe song twice, both times during their special 3-Set New Year's Eve\nshows.[20]\n\nIn March 2017, [Broadway](/wiki/Broadway_theatre \"Broadway theatre\") and\nHollywood artists including [Liz Callaway](/wiki/Liz_Callaway \"Liz Callaway\"),\n[FORTE](/wiki/Forte_\\(vocal_group\\) \"Forte \\(vocal group\\)\"), [Annie\nGolden](/wiki/Annie_Golden \"Annie Golden\"), [Telly Leung](/wiki/Telly_Leung\n\"Telly Leung\") and [Chris Mann](/wiki/Chris_Mann_\\(singer\\) \"Chris Mann\n\\(singer\\)\") performed a gospel-flavored version of the song for a single and\nvideo to benefit [Americans for the Arts](/wiki/Americans_for_the_Arts\n\"Americans for the Arts\").[21]\n\n\"With a Little Help from My Friends\"  \n---  \n[![With a Little Help From My Friends - Joe\nCocker.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/With_a_Little_Help_From_My_Friends_-\n_Joe_Cocker.jpg/220px-With_a_Little_Help_From_My_Friends_-\n_Joe_Cocker.jpg)](/wiki/File:With_a_Little_Help_From_My_Friends_-\n_Joe_Cocker.jpg)  \n[Single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\") by [Joe\nCocker](/wiki/Joe_Cocker \"Joe Cocker\")  \nfrom the album _[With a Little Help from My\nFriends](/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends_\\(Joe_Cocker_album\\) \"With a\nLittle Help from My Friends \\(Joe Cocker album\\)\")_  \n[B-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and B-side\") | \"Something's Coming On\"  \nReleased | October 1968 ([UK](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"))  \nFormat | [7\"](/wiki/7%22_single \"7\" single\")  \nRecorded | 1968  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\") | [Blues rock](/wiki/Blues_rock \"Blues rock\"), [hard rock](/wiki/Hard_rock \"Hard rock\"), [soul](/wiki/Soul_music \"Soul music\")  \nLength | 5:11  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\") | [Regal Zonophone](/wiki/Regal_Zonophone \"Regal Zonophone\")  \n[Songwriter(s)](/wiki/Songwriter \"Songwriter\") | [Lennon–McCartney](/wiki/Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney \"Lennon–McCartney\")  \n[Joe Cocker](/wiki/Joe_Cocker \"Joe Cocker\") singles chronology  \n| \"Marjorine\"  \n(1968) Marjorine1968 | \"**With a Little Help from My Friends** \"  \n(1968) With a Little Help from My Friends1968 | \"Delta Lady\"  \n(1969) Delta Lady1969  \n---|---|---  \nAudio sample  \n![](data:image/png,%89PNG%0D%0A%1A%0A%00%00%00%0DIHDR%00%00%00%01%00%00%00%01%08%02%00%00%00%90wS%DE%00%00%00%01sRGB%00%AE%CE%1C%E9%00%00%00%09pHYs%00%00%0B%13%00%00%0B%13%01%00%9A%9C%18%00%00%00%07tIME%07%DB%0B%0A%17%041%80%9B%E7%F2%00%00%00%19tEXtComment%00Created%20with%20GIMPW%81%0E%17%00%00%00%0CIDAT%08%D7c%60%60%60%00%00%00%04%00%01'4'%0A%00%00%00%00IEND%AEB%60%82)[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Joe_Cocker_-_09_-_With_A_Little_Help_From_My_Friends.ogg)\n\n  * [file](/wiki/File:Joe_Cocker_-_09_-_With_A_Little_Help_From_My_Friends.ogg \"File:Joe Cocker - 09 - With A Little Help From My Friends.ogg\")\n  * [help](/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_help \"Wikipedia:Media help\")\n\n  \n  \n## Joe Cocker version\n\nEnglish singer [Joe Cocker](/wiki/Joe_Cocker \"Joe Cocker\")'s version of \"With\na Little Help from My Friends\" was a radical re-arrangement of the original,\nin a slower, **6**  \n**8** meter, using different chords in the middle eight, and a lengthy\ninstrumental introduction (featuring drums by [Procol\nHarum](/wiki/Procol_Harum \"Procol Harum\")'s [B.J.

The main character\n(George Orr), who can manipulate reality with his dreams, comes upon a 45 of\nthe song at a novelty shop run by an alien. The alien hands George the 45\nsaying \"Help is available.\" The song plays in the soundtrack and morphs into a\nsynthesizer version. The film was out of circulation for over 20 years. When\nit was finally re-aired on PBS and released on DVD in 2001, many fans were\nupset that the original Beatles recording was replaced by a singer with an\nacoustic guitar. This was due to changes in publishing rights that have\noccurred since 1980 involving the dissolution of The Beatles' original\nNorthern Songs and the acquisition by Sony/ATV (partly owned by the Jackson\nfamily).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Everett 1999, p. 123. \"In the United Kingdom _Sgt.
