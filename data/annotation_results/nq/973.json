Peninsula](/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula \"Arabian\nPeninsula\") in [Western Asia](/wiki/Western_Asia \"Western Asia\"). Its official\nreligion is [Islam](/wiki/Islam_in_Oman \"Islam in Oman\").\n\nHolding a strategically important position at the mouth of the [Persian\nGulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf \"Persian Gulf\"), the country shares land borders with\nthe [United Arab Emirates](/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates \"United Arab Emirates\")\nto the northwest, [Saudi Arabia](/wiki/Saudi_Arabia \"Saudi Arabia\") to the\nwest, and [Yemen](/wiki/Yemen \"Yemen\") to the southwest, and shares [marine\nborders](/wiki/Maritime_boundary \"Maritime boundary\") with [Iran](/wiki/Iran\n\"Iran\") and [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan \"Pakistan\"). The coast is formed by the\n[Arabian Sea](/wiki/Arabian_Sea \"Arabian Sea\") on the southeast and the [Gulf\nof Oman](/wiki/Gulf_of_Oman \"Gulf of Oman\") on the northeast. The\n[Madha](/wiki/Madha \"Madha\") and [Musandam](/wiki/Musandam_Governorate\n\"Musandam Governorate\") exclaves are surrounded by the UAE on their land\nborders, with the [Strait of Hormuz](/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz \"Strait of\nHormuz\") (which it shares with [Iran](/wiki/Iran \"Iran\")) and Gulf of Oman\nforming Musandam's coastal boundaries.\n\nFrom the late 17th century, the Omani Sultanate was a [powerful\nempire](/wiki/Colonial_empire \"Colonial empire\"), vying with\n[Portugal](/wiki/Portugal \"Portugal\") and Britain for influence in the\n[Persian Gulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf \"Persian Gulf\") and [Indian\nOcean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian Ocean\"). At its peak in the 19th century,\nOmani influence or control extended across the Strait of Hormuz to modern-day\n[Iran](/wiki/Iran \"Iran\") and [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan \"Pakistan\"), and as\nfar south as [Zanzibar](/wiki/Zanzibar \"Zanzibar\").[7] As its power declined\nin the 20th century, the sultanate came under the influence of the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nHistorically, [Muscat](/wiki/Muscat,_Oman \"Muscat, Oman\") was the principal\ntrading port of the Persian Gulf region. Muscat was also among the most\nimportant trading ports of the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian\nOcean\").\n\nThe Sultan [Qaboos bin Said al Said](/wiki/Qaboos_bin_Said_al_Said \"Qaboos bin\nSaid al Said\") has been the hereditary leader of the country, an [absolute\nmonarchy](/wiki/Absolute_monarchy \"Absolute monarchy\"),[8] since 1970.[8]\nSultan Qaboos is the [longest-serving current\nruler](/wiki/Current_reigning_monarchs_by_length_of_reign \"Current reigning\nmonarchs by length of reign\") in the Middle East,[9] and third-[longest\ncurrent reigning monarch](/wiki/Current_reigning_monarchs_by_length_of_reign\n\"Current reigning monarchs by length of reign\") in the world.\n\nOman is a member of the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United\nNations\"), the [Arab League](/wiki/Arab_League \"Arab League\"), the [Gulf\nCooperation Council](/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council \"Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil\"), the [Non-Aligned Movement](/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement \"Non-Aligned\nMovement\") and the [Organisation of Islamic\nCooperation](/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation \"Organisation of\nIslamic Cooperation\"). It has modest oil reserves, ranking [25th\nglobally](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves \"List of countries by\nproven oil reserves\").[10][11] Nevertheless, in 2010 the [UNDP](/wiki/UNDP\n\"UNDP\") ranked Oman as the most improved nation in the world in terms of\ndevelopment during the preceding 40 years.[12] A significant portion of its\neconomy involves [tourism](/wiki/Tourism_in_Oman \"Tourism in Oman\") and trade\nof fish, dates, and certain agricultural produce. This sets it apart from its\nneighbors' largely oil-dependent economies. Oman is categorized as a [high-\nincome economy](/wiki/High-income_economy \"High-income economy\") and ranks as\nthe 70th most peaceful country in the world according to the [Global Peace\nIndex](/wiki/Global_Peace_Index \"Global Peace Index\").[13]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Prehistory and ancient history\n    * 1.2 Portuguese colonization\n    * 1.3 18th and 19th centuries\n    * 1.4 Reign of Sultan Said (1932–1970)\n    * 1.5 Reign of Sultan Qaboos (from 1970)\n  * 2 Geography\n    * 2.1 Climate\n    * 2.2 Flora and fauna\n    * 2.3 Environmental issues\n  * 3 Politics\n    * 3.1 Legal system\n    * 3.2 Human rights\n    * 3.3 Migrant workers\n    * 3.4 Foreign policy\n    * 3.5 Military\n    * 3.6 Administrative divisions\n  * 4 Economy\n    * 4.1 Oil and gas\n    * 4.2 Tourism\n  * 5 Demographics\n    * 5.1 Religion\n    * 5.2 Languages\n    * 5.3 Largest cities\n  * 6 Culture\n    * 6.1 Dress\n    * 6.2 Music and cinema\n    * 6.3 Media\n    * 6.4 Food\n    * 6.5 Sports\n  * 7 Education\n  * 8 Health\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 Notes\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n## History\n\nMain article: [History of Oman](/wiki/History_of_Oman \"History of Oman\")\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nAt Aybut Al Auwal, in the [Dhofar Governorate](/wiki/Dhofar_Governorate\n\"Dhofar Governorate\") of Oman, a site was discovered in 2011 containing more\nthan 100 surface scatters of stone tools, belonging to a regionally specific\nAfrican [lithic industry](/wiki/Lithic_industry \"Lithic industry\")—the late\n[Nubian](/wiki/Nubia \"Nubia\") Complex—known previously only from the northeast\nand [Horn of Africa](/wiki/Horn_of_Africa \"Horn of Africa\"). Two optically\nstimulated luminescence age estimates place the Arabian Nubian Complex at\n106,000 years old. This supports the proposition that early human populations\nmoved from Africa into Arabia during the [Late\nPleistocene](/wiki/Late_Pleistocene \"Late Pleistocene\").[14]\n\nIn recent years known primarily from survey finds, Palaeolithic and Neolithic\nsites have come to light most on the eastern coast. Main Palaeolithic sites\ninclude Saiwan-Ghunaim in the Barr al-Hikman.[15] Archaeological remains are\nparticularly numerous for the Bronze Age [Umm an-Nar](/wiki/Umm_an-Nar \"Umm\nan-Nar\") and [Wadi Suq](/w/index.php?title=Wadi_Suq&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Wadi Suq \\(page does not exist\\)\") periods. Sites such as [Baat](/wiki/Baat\n\"Baat\") show accomplished wheel-turned pottery, excellent hand-made stone\nvessels, a metals industry, and monumental architecture .[16] The Early\n(1300‒300 BC) and Late Iron Ages (100 BC‒300 AD) show more differences than\nsimilarities to each other. Thereafter until the coming of the Ibadhidya\nlittle or nothing of is known.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/World_Heritage_Grave_Al_Ayn_Oman.JPG/220px-\nWorld_Heritage_Grave_Al_Ayn_Oman.JPG)](/wiki/File:World_Heritage_Grave_Al_Ayn_Oman.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:World_Heritage_Grave_Al_Ayn_Oman.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA grave at [Al Ayn](/wiki/Archaeological_Sites_of_Bat,_Al-Khutm_and_Al-Ayn\n\"Archaeological Sites of Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn\"), Oman, a World Heritage\nsite\n\n[Sumerian](/wiki/Sumerian_language \"Sumerian language\") tablets refer to a\ncountry called Magan[17][18] and [Akkadian](/wiki/Akkadian_language \"Akkadian\nlanguage\") ones Makan,[19][20] a name which links Oman's ancient copper\nresources.[21] Mazoon, a Persian name used for the region. Over centuries\ntribes from the west settled in Oman, making a living by fishing, farming,\nherding or stock breeding, and many present day Omani families trace their\nancestral roots to other parts of Arabia. When the emigrants from northern-\nwestern and south-western Arabia arrived in Oman, they had to compete with the\nindigenous population for the best arable land.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Lia_sites.JPG/220px-\nLia_sites.JPG)](/wiki/File:Lia_sites.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Lia_sites.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nOman, Late Iron Age sites\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s scholars like [John C.\nWilkinson](/w/index.php?title=John_C._Wilkinson&action=edit&redlink=1 \"John C.\nWilkinson \\(page does not exist\\)\")[22] believed by virtue of oral history\nthat in the 6th century BC, the Achaemenids exerted control over the Omani\npeninsula, most likely ruling from a coastal center such as\n[Suhar](/wiki/Suhar \"Suhar\").[23] Central Oman has its own indigenous Samad\nLate Iron Age cultural assemblage named eponymously from [Samad al-\nShan](/wiki/Samad_al-Shan \"Samad al-Shan\"). In the northern part of the Oman\nPeninsula the [Recent Pre-Islamic Period](/w/index.php?title=Recent_Pre-\nIslamic_Period&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Recent Pre-Islamic Period \\(page does\nnot exist\\)\") begins in the 3rd century BCE and extends into the 3rd century\nCE. Whether or not Persians brought south-eastern Arabian under their control\nis a moot point, since the lack of Persian finds speak against this belief.\nFour centuries later, Omanis came in contact with and accepted\n[Islam](/wiki/Islam \"Islam\").[24][25] The conversion of Oman is usually\nascribed to [Amr ibn al-As](/wiki/Amr_ibn_al-As \"Amr ibn al-As\"), who was sent\nby the prophet [Muhammad](/wiki/Muhammad \"Muhammad\") during the [Expedition of\nZaid ibn Haritha (Hisma)](/wiki/Expedition_of_Zaid_ibn_Haritha_\\(Hisma\\)\n\"Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha \\(Hisma\\)\").\n\n### Portuguese colonization\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Seydi_Ali-\nAmbush.png/220px-Seydi_Ali-Ambush.png)](/wiki/File:Seydi_Ali-Ambush.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Seydi_Ali-Ambush.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSeydi Ali Reis and his galleys taken in an ambush by Portuguese forces while\ntrying to bring back his flotilla from Basra to Suez in August 1554\n\nA decade after [Vasco da Gama](/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama \"Vasco da Gama\")'s\nsuccessful voyage around the [Cape of Good Hope](/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope \"Cape\nof Good Hope\") and to [India](/wiki/India \"India\") in 1497–98, the Portuguese\narrived in Oman and occupied [Muscat](/wiki/Muscat,_Oman \"Muscat, Oman\") for a\n143-year period, from 1507 to 1650. Their fortress still remains. In need of\nan outpost to protect their sea lanes, the Portuguese built up and fortified\nthe city, where remnants of their colonial architectural style still exist. An\n[Ottoman fleet](/wiki/Ottoman_Navy \"Ottoman Navy\") [captured Muscat in\n1552](/wiki/Capture_of_Muscat_\\(1552\\) \"Capture of Muscat \\(1552\\)\"), during\nthe fight for control of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean.[26]\n\nThe [Ottoman Turks](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman Empire\") captured Muscat\nfrom the Portuguese in 1581 and held it until 1588. Rebellious tribes\neventually drove out the Portuguese, but were themselves pushed out about a\ncentury later, in 1741, by the leader of an Omani tribe, who began the current\nline of ruling sultans. Except for a brief Persian invasion in the late 1740s,\nOman has been self-governing ever since.[27]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Maskat_%26_Oman_map.png/170px-\nMaskat_%26_Oman_map.png)](/wiki/File:Maskat_%26_Oman_map.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Maskat_%26_Oman_map.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Sultanate of Muscat and Oman](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Muscat_and_Oman\n\"Sultanate of Muscat and Oman\")\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Sultan%27s_Palace%2C_Zanzibar.JPG/300px-\nSultan%27s_Palace%2C_Zanzibar.JPG)](/wiki/File:Sultan%27s_Palace,_Zanzibar.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sultan%27s_Palace,_Zanzibar.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Sultan's Palace](/wiki/Palace_Museum,_Zanzibar \"Palace Museum, Zanzibar\")\nin [Zanzibar](/wiki/Zanzibar \"Zanzibar\"), which was once Oman's capital and\nresidence of its Sultans\n\nIn the 1690s, [Saif bin Sultan](/wiki/Saif_bin_Sultan \"Saif bin Sultan\"), the\n[Imam](/wiki/Imam \"Imam\") of Oman, pressed down the [Swahili\nCoast](/wiki/Swahili_Coast \"Swahili Coast\"). A major obstacle to his progress\nwas [Fort Jesus](/wiki/Fort_Jesus \"Fort Jesus\"), housing the garrison of a\n[Portuguese](/wiki/Portugal \"Portugal\") settlement at [Mombasa](/wiki/Mombasa\n\"Mombasa\"). After a two-year siege, the fort fell to bin Sultan in 1698.\nThereafter the Omanis easily ejected the Portuguese from\n[Zanzibar](/wiki/Zanzibar \"Zanzibar\") and from all other coastal regions north\nof [Mozambique](/wiki/Mozambique \"Mozambique\"). The Persians invaded Oman in\n1737. They were driven out in 1749 when the [Al Said](/wiki/Al_Said \"Al Said\")\ndynasty came to power. It continues to rule Oman to this day.\n\nZanzibar was a valuable property as the main [slave\nmarket](/wiki/Arab_slave_trade#Geography_of_the_slave_trade \"Arab slave\ntrade\") of the Swahili Coast, and became an increasingly important part of the\nOmani empire, a fact reflected by the decision of the 19th century Imam of\nMuscat, [Sa'id ibn Sultan](/wiki/Sa%27id_ibn_Sultan \"Sa'id ibn Sultan\"), to\nmake it his main place of residence in 1837. Sa'id built impressive palaces\nand gardens in Zanzibar. Rivalry between his two sons was resolved, with the\nhelp of forceful British diplomacy, when one of them,\n[Majid](/wiki/Majid_bin_Said_of_Zanzibar \"Majid bin Said of Zanzibar\"),\nsucceeded to Zanzibar and to the many regions claimed by the family on the\nSwahili Coast. The other son,\n[Thuwaini](/wiki/Thuwaini_bin_Said,_Sultan_of_Muscat_and_Oman \"Thuwaini bin\nSaid, Sultan of Muscat and Oman\"), inherited [Muscat and\nOman](/wiki/Muscat_and_Oman \"Muscat and Oman\"). Zanzibar influences in the\n[Comoros](/wiki/Comoros \"Comoros\") archipelago in the Indian Ocean indirectly\nintroduced Omani customs to the Comorian culture. These influences include\nclothing traditions and wedding ceremonies.[28]\n\nIn 1783, Oman's Seyyid Sultan, defeated ruler of Muscat, was granted\nsovereignty over [Gwadar](/wiki/Gwadar \"Gwadar\").

A subsidiary of the [Iraq Petroleum\nCompany](/wiki/Iraq_Petroleum_Company \"Iraq Petroleum Company\") was intensely\ninterested in some promising geological formations near [Fahud](/wiki/Fahud\n\"Fahud\"). Under the terms of the 1920 treaty of Seeb, the Sultan claimed all\ndealings with the oil company as his prerogative.

Political\nreforms were eventually introduced. Historically, voters had been chosen from\namong tribal leaders, intellectuals, and businessmen. In 1997 Sultan Qaboos\ndecreed that women could vote for, and stand for election to, the Majlis al-\nShura, the [Consultative Assembly of Oman](/wiki/Consultative_Assembly_of_Oman\n\"Consultative Assembly of Oman\"). Two women were duly elected to the body.\n\nIn 2002, voting rights were extended to all citizens over the age of 21, and\nthe first elections to the Consultative Assembly under the new rules were held\nin 2003. In 2004, the Sultan appointed Oman's first female minister with\nportfolio, [Sheikha Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel al-\nSayabiyah](/wiki/Aisha_bint_Khalfan_bin_Jameel \"Aisha bint Khalfan bin\nJameel\"). She was appointed to the post of National Authority for Industrial\nCraftsmanship, an office that attempts to preserve and promote Oman's\ntraditional crafts and stimulate industry.[38] Despite these changes, there\nwas little change to the actual political makeup of the government. The Sultan\ncontinued to rule by decree. Nearly 100 suspected Islamists were arrested in\n2005 and 31 people were convicted of trying to overthrow the government. They\nwere ultimately pardoned in June of the same year.[10]\n\nInspired by the [Arab Spring](/wiki/Arab_Spring \"Arab Spring\") uprisings\ntaking place throughout the region, [protests](/wiki/2011_Omani_protests \"2011\nOmani protests\") also occurred in Oman during the early months of 2011.\nAlthough they did not call for the ousting of the regime, demonstrators\ndemanded political reforms, improved living conditions, and the creation of\nmore jobs. They were dispersed by riot police in February 2011. Sultan Qaboos\nreacted by promising jobs and benefits. In October 2011, elections were held\nto the Consultative Assembly, to which Sultan Qaboos promised greater powers.\nThe following year, the government began a crackdown on internet criticism. In\nSeptember 2012, trials began of 'activists' accused of posting \"abusive and\nprovocative\" criticism of the government online.

permission is not\nautomatically granted.[71] Citizen marriage to a foreigner abroad without\nministry approval may result in denial of entry for the foreign spouse at the\nborder and preclude children from claiming citizenship rights.[71] It also may\nresult in a bar from government employment and a fine of 2,000 rials\n($5,200).[71]\n\nIn August 2014, The Omani writer and human rights defender [Mohammed\nAlfazari](/wiki/Mohammed_Alfazari \"Mohammed Alfazari\"), the founder and\neditor-in-chief of the e-magazine Mowatin “Citizen”, disappeared after going\nto the police station in the Al-Qurum district of Muscat.[74] For several\nmonths the Omani government denied his detention and refused to disclose\ninformation about his whereabouts or condition.[74] On July 17, 2015, Al\nFazari left Oman seeking political asylum in UK after a travel ban was issued\nagainst him without providing any reasons and after his official documents\nincluding his national ID and passport were confiscated for more than 8\nmonths.[75] There were more reports of politically motivated disappearances in\nthe country.[71] In 2012, armed security forces arrested Sultan al-Saadi, a\nsocial media activist.[71] According to reports, authorities detained him at\nan unknown location for one month for comments he posted online critical of\nthe government.[71] Authorities previously arrested al-Saadi in 2011 for\nparticipating in protests and again in 2012 for posting comments online deemed\ninsulting to Sultan Qaboos.[71] In May 2012 security forces detained Ismael\nal-Meqbali, Habiba al-Hinai, and Yaqoub al-Kharusi, human rights activists who\nwere visiting striking oil workers.[71] Authorities released al-Hinai and al-\nKharusi shortly after their detention but did not inform al-Meqbali’s friends\nand family of his whereabouts for weeks.[71] Authorities pardoned al-Meqbali\nin March.[71] In December 2013, a Yemeni national disappeared in Oman after he\nwas arrested at a checkpoint in Dhofar Governorate.[76] Omani authorities\nrefuse to acknowledge his detention.[76] His whereabouts and condition remain\nunknown.[76]\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission, established in 2008, is not independent\nfrom the regime.[8] It is chaired by the former deputy inspector general of\nPolice and Customs and its members are appointed by royal decree.[8] In June\n2012, one of its members requested that she be relieved of her duties because\nshe disagreed with a statement made by the Commission justifying the arrest of\nintellectuals and bloggers and the restriction of freedom of expression in the\nname of respect for “the principles of religion and customs of the\ncountry”.[8]\n\nSince the beginning of the “Omani Spring” in January 2011, a number of serious\nviolations of civil rights has been reported, amounting to a critical\ndeterioration of the human rights situation.[8] Prisons are inaccessible to\nindependent monitors.[8] Members of the independent Omani Group of Human\nRights have been harassed, arrested and sentenced to jail.

During [Ramadan](/wiki/Ramadan \"Ramadan\"), dinner is served after the\n[Taraweeh](/wiki/Taraweeh \"Taraweeh\") prayers, sometimes as late as 11 pm.\nHowever these dinner timings differ according to each family – for instance,\nsome families would choose to eat right after [maghrib](/wiki/Maghrib\n\"Maghrib\") prayers and have dessert after taraweeh.\n\nArsia, a festival meal served during celebrations, consists of mashed rice and\nmeat (sometimes chicken). Another popular festival meal, shuwa, consists of\nmeat cooked very slowly (sometimes for up to 2 days) in an underground clay-\noven. The meat becomes extremely tender and it is infused with spices and\nherbs before cooking to give it a very distinct taste. Fish is often used in\nmain dishes too, and the [kingfish](/wiki/Giant_trevally \"Giant trevally\") is\na popular ingredient. Mashuai is a meal consisting of a whole spit-roasted\nkingfish served with lemon rice.\n\nRukhal bread is a thin, round bread originally baked over a fire made from\npalm leaves. It is eaten at any meal, typically served with Omani honey for\nbreakfast or crumbled over curry for dinner. Chicken, fish, and lamb or mutton\nare regularly used in dishes. The Omani [halwa](/wiki/Halva \"Halva\") is a very\npopular sweet, basically consisting of cooked raw sugar with nuts. There are\nmany different flavors, the most popular ones being the black halwa (original)\nand the saffron halwa. Halwa is considered as a symbol of Omani hospitality,\nand is traditionally served with coffee. As is the case with most [Arab States\nof the Persian Gulf](/wiki/Arab_States_of_the_Persian_Gulf \"Arab States of the\nPersian Gulf\"), alcohol is only available over-the-counter to non-Muslims.\nMuslims can still purchase alcoholic drinks. Alcohol is served in many hotels\nand a few restaurants.\n\n### Sports\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/MuscatGulfCup2.jpg/220px-\nMuscatGulfCup2.jpg)](/wiki/File:MuscatGulfCup2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MuscatGulfCup2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOman hosted and won the [19th Arabian Gulf Cup](/wiki/19th_Arabian_Gulf_Cup\n\"19th Arabian Gulf Cup\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Flickr_-\n_tpower1978_-_World_Cup_Qualifiers_%287%29.jpg/220px-Flickr_-\n_tpower1978_-_World_Cup_Qualifiers_%287%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Flickr_-\n_tpower1978_-_World_Cup_Qualifiers_\\(7\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Flickr_-_tpower1978_-_World_Cup_Qualifiers_\\(7\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers Round 3 match between Oman and Japan at the\nRoyal Oman Police Stadium on June 7, 2008 in Muscat, Oman\n\nIn October 2004, the Omani government set up a [Ministry of Sports\nAffairs](/w/index.php?title=Ministry_of_Sports_Affairs&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Ministry of Sports Affairs \\(page does not exist\\)\") to replace the General\nOrganization for youth, sports and cultural affairs.

It involves two bulls of the [Brahman](/wiki/Brahman_\\(cattle\\)\n\"Brahman \\(cattle\\)\") breed pitted against one another and as the name\nimplies, they engage in a forceful barrage of headbutts. The first one to\ncollapse or concede its ground is declared the loser. Most bull-butting\nmatches are short affairs and last for less than 5 minutes.[147][148] The\norigins of bull-butting in Oman remain unknown, but many locals believe it was\nbrought to Oman by the Moors of Spanish origin. Yet others say it has a direct\nconnection with [Portugal](/wiki/Portugal \"Portugal\"), which colonized the\nOmani coastline for nearly two centuries.[149]\n\nIn Cricket, Oman qualified for the [2016 ICC World\nTwenty20](/wiki/2016_ICC_World_Twenty20 \"2016 ICC World Twenty20\") by securing\nsixth place in [2015 ICC World Twenty20\nQualifier](/wiki/2015_ICC_World_Twenty20_Qualifier \"2015 ICC World Twenty20\nQualifier\").

Today, there are over 1,000 state schools and about 650,000\nstudents.\n\nOman's first university, [Sultan Qaboos\nUniversity](/wiki/Sultan_Qaboos_University \"Sultan Qaboos University\"), opened\nin 1986.
