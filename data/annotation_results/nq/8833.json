A 1990 [Harvard University](/wiki/Harvard_University \"Harvard\nUniversity\") law graduate from the [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia\n\"Philadelphia\") area, she is Carrie's confidante and voice of reason. In the\nearly seasons she is portrayed as masculine and distrustful and resentful of\nmen, but this image softens over the years, particularly after she becomes\npregnant by her [on-again, off-again](/wiki/On-again,_off-again_relationship\n\"On-again, off-again relationship\") boyfriend, Steve Brady, whom she\neventually marries. The birth of her son, Brady Hobbes, brings up new issues\nfor her [Type A](/wiki/Type_A_personality \"Type A personality\"), workaholic\npersonality, but she eventually finds a way to balance career, being single,\nand motherhood. Of the four women, she is the first to purchase an apartment\n(an indicator of her success), which she gives up when she moves into a\n[Brooklyn](/wiki/Brooklyn \"Brooklyn\") townhouse in the final season to make\nroom for her growing family.\n\n## _Sex and the City: The\nMovie_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miranda_Hobbes&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Sex and the City: The Movie\")]\n\nIn [the movie](/wiki/Sex_and_the_City_\\(film\\) \"Sex and the City \\(film\\)\"),\nMiranda is still married to Steve, and they are living in Brooklyn with their\nson Brady, who is now five years old. We learn that she is still employing\nMagda and that Steve's mother Mary is living in a nursing home, as she now\nsuffers from advancing Alzheimer's. Miranda and Steve's relationship has\nbecome stale, with Miranda under pressure of her job and caring for Brady.\nAfter a shared laugh one night over Miranda having a milk moustache, the two\nhave sex in a moment of newfound passion, but midway through Miranda tells\nSteve to hurry up because she has to get up early, which upsets him. At one of\ntheir coffee dates, Miranda tells the girls that she and Steve have not had\nsex in six months, and shortly afterwards Steve confesses he had sex with\nanother woman one time out of frustration. Although Steve begs for\nforgiveness, Miranda insists on splitting up, and she moves to the [Lower East\nSide](/wiki/Lower_East_Side \"Lower East Side\"). In a moment of shortsighted\nselfishness, she tells Big the night before his and Carrie's wedding that they\nare crazy to get married because it ruins everything, causing him to leave\nCarrie at the altar. Miranda wants to confess everything right after, but\nCharlotte convinces her it was not really her fault but Big's. The girls\nchange the honeymoon trip into a vacation trip for themselves. Almost a\n(lonely) year passes by before Miranda confesses it on Valentine's Day to\nCarrie about her wrongdoing. Carrie berates Miranda for wanting forgiveness\nfor her own mistake but refusing to forgive Steve. Miranda and Steve go to\ncouples' therapy, during which they decide to meet on the Brooklyn Bridge in\ntwo weeks if they want to forgive and forget what happened and start over.\nMiranda starts contemplating her relationship with Steve by making a pro and\ncons list. She looks in the mirror and sees that she has a milk moustache.\nThis makes her realize she wants to be with Steve after all and she hurries to\nthe Brooklyn Bridge to reconcile with him.\n\n## _Sex and the City\n2_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miranda_Hobbes&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Sex and the City 2\")]\n\nIn _[Sex and the City 2](/wiki/Sex_and_the_City_2 \"Sex and the City 2\")_ ,\nMiranda is an overworked lawyer who barely has enough time to show up to her\nson's school activities. She feels that she's being taken advantage of at\nwork, overlooked because she is a woman. When Steve suggests she quit her job,\nshe is reluctant but does after she is overlooked—then shushed—by her boss\nduring a meeting. To get over the shock, she decides to accompany Samantha,\nCarrie and Charlotte to [Abu Dhabi](/wiki/Abu_Dhabi \"Abu Dhabi\"). While there,\nshe is obsessed with learning the language and enjoying the traditions. She\nalso sympathizes with Charlotte at her feeling inadequate, confessing that\nit's exhausting being a \"good\" mother. When she arrives home, after they're\nkicked out of the hotel, she looks for and finds a more self-fulfilling job.\nShe is last seen at an outdoor staff meeting (having found a new position at\nanother, more relaxed law firm) where she is obviously flourishing and\nappreciated.\n\n##\nRelationships[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miranda_Hobbes&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Relationships\")]\n\n### Skipper\nJohnston[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miranda_Hobbes&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Skipper Johnston\")]\n\nSkipper Johnston (Ben Weber) is a 27-year-old website developer with whom\nMiranda enters into a tentative relationship in the first season. Originally\nintroduced by Carrie, Miranda finds Skipper young and immature, and is\nirritated by his romantic view of life and love, which contrasts sharply with\nher cynical outlook. Although they occasionally engage in an on-again, off-\nagain sexual relationship, she never plans for him to become a serious\ninterest.\n\nIn contrast, Skipper is terribly smitten with Miranda from the start, even\ngoing so far as to break up with a girl in mid-intercourse when Miranda calls,\nas he believes it means that \"the woman he loves most\" wants to be with him.\nHorrified at learning this, Miranda suggests dating other people but Skipper,\nangered by Miranda's attitude, breaks it off and leaves. He is next seen when\nhis latest girlfriend ends things with him and as this has happened a lot,\nSkipper is angry - attracting Miranda's attention again.\n\n### Dr. Robert\nLeeds[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miranda_Hobbes&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Dr. Robert Leeds\")]\n\nDr. Robert Leeds ([Blair Underwood](/wiki/Blair_Underwood \"Blair Underwood\"))\nis a successful [sports medicine](/wiki/Sports_medicine \"Sports medicine\")\ndoctor for the [New York Knicks](/wiki/New_York_Knicks \"New York Knicks\"),\nwhom Miranda meets while interviewing him with fellow members of her\nbuilding's tenant board to occupy a vacant apartment. Upon Robert's arrival,\nMiranda is instantly charmed by him, and somewhat hijacks the interview in\norder to learn more about him. Robert is eventually approved to move in, and\nin time the two begin a short but lively romantic relationship. Despite\nMiranda and Robert's sparks of chemistry, Miranda cannot control her longing\nfor her current on-again, off-again boyfriend, Steve Brady. Eventually, at her\nson's first birthday party, Miranda professes her love to Steve, and her\nrelationship with Robert is ended off-screen. After a few awkward encounters,\nRobert overcomes his anger towards Miranda and Steve, and is last seen in the\nseries with two scantily dressed women in his apartment.\n\n### Steve Brady[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miranda_Hobbes&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Steve Brady\")]\n\n[Steve Brady](/wiki/Steve_Brady \"Steve Brady\") ([David\nEigenberg](/wiki/David_Eigenberg \"David Eigenberg\")) and Miranda meet during\nthe second season when Miranda is waiting for Carrie at the bar where Steve\nworks. Although Miranda simply sees Steve as a one-night stand after they\nmeet, Steve senses a strong connection, and he asks to see her again. Miranda\nrefuses at first, but they become a couple after she realizes her strong\nattraction for Steve. The couple's difference in economic status creates\ntension in their relationship, and they eventually break up. However, they\nremain on friendly terms, often leading to a sexual relationship between the\ntwo. After Steve loses one of his testicles to cancer, Miranda sleeps with him\nto convince him that having one ball will not prevent women from having sex\nwith him. This union results in her pregnancy. She initially decides to have\nan abortion without planning to inform Steve of her pregnancy. At the clinic,\nshe changes her mind, and decides to keep the baby. Miranda tells Steve she is\npregnant and will take on full responsibility, including raising the child and\nproviding all the related finances, but Steve can visit whenever he wants and\ngenerally be a part of the baby's life. Steve later proposes to Miranda, which\nprompts her to yell at him that she doesn't want to marry him, to which Steve\nresponds that he doesn't really want to marry her. Miranda gives birth to\nBrady Hobbes (an homage to their respective surnames), and the two try to\nraise him together as platonic partners, with difficulty. Miranda initially\npretends that she doesn't love Steve, but when she attempts to admit her\nfeelings for him, she discovers he is now seeing another woman, Debbie.\nEventually, at Brady's first birthday party, Miranda ends up blurting out her\nlove for Steve and, to her delight and surprise, Steve admits that he, too,\nloves Miranda, and that she is \"the one.\" They kiss, and within three weeks\nthey are back together; they remain together for the rest of the series,\neventually getting married in a simple ceremony with their closest friends and\nfamily in a [community garden](/wiki/Community_garden \"Community garden\") and\npurchasing a townhouse in Brooklyn for their growing family. In _[Sex and the\nCity: The Movie](/wiki/Sex_and_the_City_\\(film\\) \"Sex and the City \\(film\\)\")_\n, the pair go through a rough part whereby Steve cheats on Miranda. The couple\nsplit and then go through counselling and reunite at the end of the film.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miranda_Hobbes&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section:
