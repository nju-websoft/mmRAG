Kennedy](/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy\n\"Assassination of John F. Kennedy\") in 1963.[1] The President was shot and\nkilled with a rifle purchased by mail-order from an ad in the magazine\n_[American Rifleman](/wiki/American_Rifleman \"American Rifleman\")_.[2]\nCongressional hearings followed and a ban on mail-order gun sales was\ndiscussed, but no law was passed until 1968. At the hearings NRA Executive\nVice-President [Franklin Orth](/wiki/Franklin_Orth \"Franklin Orth\") supported\na ban on mail-order sales, stating, \"We do not think that any sane American,\nwho calls himself an American, can object to placing into this bill the\ninstrument which killed the president of the United States.\"[3][4]\n\nPrecursors of the passage of the Gun Control Act were Senate Bill 1975 in\n1963, \"A Bill to Regulate the Interstate Shipment of Firearms,\" and Senate\nBill 1592 in 1965, \"A Bill to Amend the Federal Firearms Act of 1938.\" Both\nwere introduced by Senator [Thomas J. Dodd](/wiki/Thomas_J._Dodd \"Thomas J.\nDodd\") and met with fierce opposition on the floor but the bills also paved\nthe way for the creation of the Gun Control Act of 1968.[5] [6]\n\nThe deaths of [Martin Luther King Jr.](/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr. \"Martin\nLuther King, Jr.\") in April 1968 and U.S. Senator [Robert F.\nKennedy](/wiki/Assassination_of_Robert_F._Kennedy \"Assassination of Robert F.\nKennedy\") in June 1968, along with fears of armed uprising in black cities,\nrenewed efforts to pass the bill.[3] On June 11, 1968, a tie vote in the House\nJudiciary Committee halted the bill's passage.[7] On reconsideration nine days\nlater, the bill was passed by the committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee\nsimilarly brought the bill to a temporary halt, but as in the House, it was\npassed on reconsideration.[8] House Resolution 17735, known as the Gun Control\nAct, was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 22, 1968[9]\nbanning mail order sales of rifles and shotguns and prohibiting most felons,\ndrug users and people found mentally incompetent from buying guns.[10][11]\n\n## Prohibited\npersons[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_Control_Act_of_1968&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Prohibited persons\")]\n\nThe Gun Control Act of 1968 was enhanced in 1993 with the passage of the\n[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention\nAct](/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act \"Brady Handgun Violence\nPrevention Act\"). The Brady Act created a background check system which\nrequired licensed sellers to inspect the criminal history background of\nprospective gun purchasers, and the Brady Act created a list of categories of\nindividuals to whom the sale of firearms is prohibited. As quoted from [18\nU.S.C. 922 (d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922):\n\n> It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any\n> firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to\n> believe that such person— (1) is under indictment for, or has been convicted\n> in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\n> year; (2) is a fugitive from justice; (3) is an unlawful user of or addicted\n> to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled\n> Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)); (4) has been adjudicated as a mental\n> defective or has been committed to any mental institution; (5) who, being an\n> alien— (A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or (B) except as\n> provided in subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to the United States under\n> a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the\n> Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(26))); (6) who [2] has\n> been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions; (7)\n> who, having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced his\n> citizenship; (8) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from\n> harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or\n> child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that\n> would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the\n> partner or child, except that this paragraph shall only apply to a court\n> order that— (A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received\n> actual notice, and at which such person had the opportunity to participate;\n> and (B) (i) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat\n> to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or (ii) by its\n> terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\n> physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably\n> be expected to cause bodily injury; or (9) has been convicted in any court\n> of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\n\nExceptions as quoted from [18 U.S.C. 921\n(a)(33)(B)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921#a_33_B_ii):\n\n> (ii) A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of such an\n> offense for purposes of this chapter if the conviction has been expunged or\n> set aside, or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has\n> had civil rights restored (if the law of the applicable jurisdiction\n> provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense) unless the\n> pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that\n> the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\n\nMany states automatically reinstate gun ownership rights upon completion of\nsentence.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Some states reinstate rights depending on the\ncrime convicted of, and others have a petition process. Those convicted of a\nfederal offense must contact the Office of the Pardon Attorney, Department of\nJustice, to receive a presidential pardon. Under the Department's rules\ngoverning petitions for executive clemency, 28 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et seq., an\napplicant must satisfy a minimum waiting period of five years before he\nbecomes eligible to apply for a presidential pardon of his federal conviction.\n\nAccording to a 21 Sep 2011 \"Open Letter to All Federal Firearms Licensees\"\nfrom ATF, holders of state-issued [medical marijuana](/wiki/Medical_marijuana\n\"Medical marijuana\") cards are automatically \"prohibited persons\" under 18\nU.S.C 922 (g)(3) and \"shipping, transporting, receiving or possessing firearms\nor ammunition\" by a medical marijuana card holder is a violation.[12]\n\nAdditionally, 18 U.S.C 922 (x) generally prohibits persons under 18 years of\nage from possessing handguns or handgun ammunition with certain exceptions for\nemployment, target practice, education, and a handgun possessed while\ndefending the home of the juvenile or a home in which they are an invited\nguest.[13]\n\nThe [Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of\n1993](/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act \"Brady Handgun Violence\nPrevention Act\") created the [National Instant Criminal Background Check\nSystem](/wiki/National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_System \"National\nInstant Criminal Background Check System\") (NICS) to prevent firearms sales to\nsuch prohibited persons.\n\n## Federal Firearms License (FFL)\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_Control_Act_of_1968&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Federal Firearms License \\(FFL\\) system\")]\n\nMain article: [Federal Firearms License](/wiki/Federal_Firearms_License\n\"Federal Firearms License\")\n\nThe Gun Control Act mandated the licensing of individuals and companies\nengaged in the business of selling firearms. This provision effectively\nprohibited the direct [mail order](/wiki/Mail_order \"Mail order\") of firearms\n(except [antique firearms](/wiki/Antique_firearms \"Antique firearms\")) by\nconsumers and mandated that anyone who wants to buy a gun in an interstate\ntransaction from a source other than a private individual must do so through a\nfederally licensed firearms dealer. The Act also banned unlicensed individuals\nfrom acquiring handguns outside their state of residence. The interstate\npurchase of long guns (rifles and shotguns) was not impeded by the Act so long\nas the seller is federally licensed and such a sale is allowed by both the\nstate of purchase and the state of residence.\n\nPrivate sales between residents of two different states are also prohibited\nwithout going through a licensed dealer, except for the case of a buyer\nholding a Curio & Relic license purchasing a firearm that qualifies as a curio\nor relic.\n\nPrivate sales between unlicensed individuals who are residents of the same\nstate are allowed under federal law so long as such transfers do not violate\nthe other existing federal and state laws. While current law mandates that a\nbackground check be performed if the seller has a federal firearms license,\nprivate parties living in the same state are not required to perform such\nchecks under federal law.\n\nA person who does not have a [Federal Firearms\nLicense](/wiki/Federal_Firearms_License \"Federal Firearms License\") may not be\n_in the business_ of buying or selling firearms. Individuals buying and\nselling firearms without a federal license must be doing so from their own\npersonal collection.\n\nUnder the Gun Control Act, a federally licensed importer, manufacturer, dealer\nor collector shall not sell or deliver any rifle or shotgun or ammunition for\nrifle or shotgun to any individual less than 18 years of age, nor any handgun\nor ammunition for a handgun to any individual less than 21 years of age.[14]\n\n### Gunsmith and Factory Repair\nException[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_Control_Act_of_1968&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Gunsmith and Factory Repair Exception\")]\n\nWhile the Gun Control Act prohibits the direct mail-ordering of firearms, a\nperson may ship a gun via contract carrier (such as [United Parcel\nService](/wiki/United_Parcel_Service \"United Parcel Service\")-UPS, [United\nStates Postal Service](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service \"United States\nPostal Service\") or [FedEx](/wiki/FedEx \"FedEx\")) to a\n[gunsmith](/wiki/Gunsmith \"Gunsmith\") (who has an FFL) or the gunmaker's\nfactory for repairs or modification. After the repair work is done, the\ngunsmith or the factory can ship the gun directly back to the customer.\n\n## Import\nrestrictions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_Control_Act_of_1968&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Import restrictions\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/ATF_form_4590.png/219px-\nATF_form_4590.png)](/wiki/File:ATF_form_4590.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ATF_form_4590.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[ATF](/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives \"Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\") Form 4590 (\"Factoring Criteria for\nWeapons\")\n\nThe GCA created what is known as the \"sporting purposes\" standard for imported\nfirearms, saying that they must \"be generally recognized as particularly\nsuitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes.\" GCA sporting purposes\nincludes [hunting](/wiki/Hunting \"Hunting\") and organized competitive target\nshooting, but does not include \"[plinking](/wiki/Plinking \"Plinking\")\" or\n\"[practical shooting](/wiki/Practical_shooting \"Practical shooting\")\" (which\nthe ATF says is closer to police/combat-style competition and not comparable\nto more traditional types of sports), nor does it allow for collection for\nhistorical or design interest.[15][16]:16–18\n\n## Marking\nrequirements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_Control_Act_of_1968&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Marking requirements\")]\n\nThe law also required that all newly manufactured firearms produced by\nlicensed manufacturers in the United States and imported into the United\nStates bear a [serial number](/wiki/Serial_number \"Serial number\"). Firearms\nmanufactured prior to the Gun Control Act and firearms manufactured by non-\nFFLs remain exempt from the serial number requirement. Defacement or removal\nof the serial number (if present) is a [felony](/wiki/Felony \"Felony\")\noffense.\n\n##\nCommentary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_Control_Act_of_1968&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Commentary\")]\n\nIn a June 1966 essay, [Neal Knox](/wiki/Neal_Knox \"Neal Knox\") wrote that what\nwas then called the Dodd Bill was opposed by outdoorsmen and conservationists\n[Harry R. Woodward](/wiki/Harry_Woodward_\\(naturalist\\) \"Harry Woodward\n\\(naturalist\\)\"), C. R. Gutermuth of the Wildlife Management Institute,\nRichard H. Stroud of the Sport Fishing Institute, Howard Carter Jr. of the\n[National Shooting Sports\nFoundation](/wiki/National_Shooting_Sports_Foundation \"National Shooting\nSports Foundation\"), E. C. Hadley of the [Sporting Arms and Ammunition\nManufacturers'\nInstitute](/wiki/Sporting_Arms_and_Ammunition_Manufacturers%27_Institute\n\"Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute\"), Robert T. Dennis of\nthe [Izaak Walton League](/wiki/Izaak_Walton_League \"Izaak Walton League\"),\n\"and countless other sportsmen, and sportsmen and industry groups\" because it\nwould have a far-reaching and damaging effect on the hunting and shooting\nsports, while failing to reduce crime.[17]\n\nIn his remarks upon signing the act in October 1968, Johnson said:\n\n> Congress adopted most of our recommendations. But this bill—as big as this\n> bill is—still falls short, because we just could not get the Congress to\n> carry out the requests we made of them. I asked for the national\n> registration of all guns and the licensing of those who carry those guns.\n> For the fact of life is that there are over 160 million guns in this\n> country—more firearms than families. If guns are to be kept out of the hands\n> of the criminal, out of the hands of the insane, and out of the hands of the\n> irresponsible, then we just must have licensing.

They were the voices of a powerful lobby, a gun lobby, that\n> has prevailed for the moment in an election year.[9]\n\nAt the time of its passage in 1968, NRA executive vice president [Franklin\nOrth](/wiki/Franklin_Orth \"Franklin Orth\") wrote in _American Rifleman_ that\n\"the measure as a whole appears to be one that the sportsmen of America can\nlive with\".[18]:95[19]\n\nIn the May 1993 issue of _[Guns& Ammo](/wiki/Guns_%26_Ammo \"Guns & Ammo\")_\nmagazine, [Jews for the Preservation of Firearms\nOwnership](/wiki/Jews_for_the_Preservation_of_Firearms_Ownership \"Jews for the\nPreservation of Firearms Ownership\") (JPFO) compared the GCA to [Nazi gun\nlaws](/wiki/Nazi_gun_control_theory \"Nazi gun control theory\").[20][21]\n\nIn a 2011 article noting the death of former U.S. Senator [James A.\nMcClure](/wiki/James_A._McClure \"James A.
