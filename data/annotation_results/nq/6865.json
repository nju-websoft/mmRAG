The term has also come to refer to any large-budget production\n_intended_ for \"blockbuster\" status, aimed at mass markets with associated\nmerchandising, sometimes on a scale that meant the financial fortunes of a\nfilm studio or a distributor could depend on it.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blockbuster_\\(entertainment\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe term began to appear in the American press in the early 1940s,[1]\nreferring to [aerial bombs capable of destroying a whole block of\nbuildings](/wiki/Blockbuster_bomb \"Blockbuster bomb\").[2] It came to be\napplied to movies as a metaphor, indicating something successful on a dramatic\nscale. Successful films such as [_Quo Vadis_](/wiki/Quo_Vadis_\\(1951_film\\)\n\"Quo Vadis \\(1951 film\\)\"), [_The Ten\nCommandments_](/wiki/The_Ten_Commandments_\\(1956_film\\) \"The Ten Commandments\n\\(1956 film\\)\"), [_Gone with the Wind_](/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)\n\"Gone with the Wind \\(film\\)\"), and _[Ben-Hur](/wiki/Ben-Hur_\\(1959_film\\)\n\"Ben-Hur \\(1959 film\\)\")_ , were called \"blockbusters\" based purely on the\namount of money earned at the box office. Other terms for highly successful\nfilms included: \"spectacular\" (_[The Wall Street\nJournal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\")_)[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] and\n\"super-grosser\" (_[New York Times](/wiki/New_York_Times \"New York\nTimes\")_).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn 1975 the usage of \"blockbuster\" for films coalesced around [Steven\nSpielberg](/wiki/Steven_Spielberg \"Steven Spielberg\")'s\n_[Jaws](/wiki/Jaws_\\(film\\) \"Jaws \\(film\\)\")_ , and became perceived as\nsomething new: a cultural phenomenon, fast-paced exciting entertainment, which\nbecame a common topic of conversation, inspiring repeated viewings.[3] The\nfilm is regarded as the first film of the \"blockbuster era\", referring to this\nas a film genre.[4] Although earlier films such as _Gone with the Wind_ (1939)\nand [_The Sound of Music_](/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_\\(film\\) \"The Sound of\nMusic \\(film\\)\") (1965) had made more in ticket sales (when adjusted for\ninflation),[5] _Jaws_ ' domestic box office take in excess of $250 million[6]\nwas seen as a new standard for \"blockbuster\".[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Two\nyears later, _[Star Wars](/wiki/Star_Wars_\\(film\\) \"Star Wars \\(film\\)\")_\nexpanded on the success of _Jaws_ , setting box office records and enjoying a\ntheatrical run that lasted more than a year.[7]\n\nAfter the success of _Jaws_ and _Star Wars_ , many Hollywood producers\nattempted to create similar \"event\" films with wide commercial appeal, and\nfilm companies began [green-lighting](/wiki/Green-light \"Green-light\")\nincreasingly large-budget films, and relying extensively on massive\nadvertising blitzes leading up to their theatrical release. These two films\nwere the prototypes for the \"summer blockbuster\" trend,[8] in which [major\nfilm studios](/wiki/Major_film_studio \"Major film studio\") and distributors\nplanned their annual marketing strategy around a big release by July 4,[9]\nhoping to attract audiences over the summer, previously a moribund time for\nticket sales. Blockbusters in the following decade included _[Close Encounters\nof the Third Kind](/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind \"Close Encounters\nof the Third Kind\")_ (late 1977),[10] _[Superman](/wiki/Superman_\\(1978_film\\)\n\"Superman \\(1978 film\\)\")_ (1978),[11] _[Alien](/wiki/Alien_\\(film\\) \"Alien\n\\(film\\)\")_ (1979),[12] _[Raiders of the Lost\nArk](/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\")_ (1981),[12]\n[E.T.](/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\")\n(1982),[12] [_Ghostbusters_](/wiki/Ghostbusters_\\(franchise\\) \"Ghostbusters\n\\(franchise\\)\") (1984),[12] _[Beverly Hills Cop](/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop\n\"Beverly Hills Cop\")_ (1984),[12] _[Back to the\nFuture](/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_\\(franchise\\) \"Back to the Future\n\\(franchise\\)\")_ (1985).[12]\n\nEventually, the focus on creating blockbusters grew so intense that a backlash\noccurred, with critics and some film-makers decrying the prevalence of a\n\"[blockbuster mentality](/wiki/Blockbuster_mentality \"Blockbuster mentality\")\"\nand lamenting the death of the author-driven, \"more artistic\" small-scale\nfilms of the [New Hollywood](/wiki/New_Hollywood \"New Hollywood\") era. This\nview is taken, for example, by film journalist [Peter\nBiskind](/wiki/Peter_Biskind \"Peter Biskind\"), who wrote that all studios\nwanted was another _Jaws_ , and as production costs rose, they were less\nwilling to take risks, and therefore based blockbusters on the \"lowest common\ndenominators\" of the mass market.[13] In his book _The Long Tail_ , [Chris\nAnderson](/wiki/Chris_Anderson_\\(writer\\) \"Chris Anderson \\(writer\\)\") talks\nabout blockbuster films, stating that a society that is hit-driven, and makes\nway and room for only those films that are expected to be a hit, is in fact a\nlimited society.[14]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blockbuster_\\(entertainment\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Box office bomb](/wiki/Box_office_bomb \"Box office bomb\")\n  * [Four-quadrant movie](/wiki/Four-quadrant_movie \"Four-quadrant movie\")\n  * [List of highest-grossing openings for films](/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_openings_for_films \"List of highest-grossing openings for films\")\n  * [List of highest-grossing films](/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films \"List of highest-grossing films\")\n  * [Oscar season](/wiki/Oscar_season \"Oscar season\")\n  * [Sleeper hit](/wiki/Sleeper_hit \"Sleeper hit\")\n  * [AAA game](/wiki/AAA_\\(video_game_industry\\) \"AAA \\(video game industry\\)\"), equivalent term in the videogame industry\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blockbuster_\\(entertainment\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Google Ngram Viewer\"](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=7&case_insensitive=on&content=blockbuster&direct_url=t4;,blockbuster;,c0;,s0;;blockbuster;,c0;;Blockbuster;,c0;;BLOCKBUSTER;,c0). _books.google.com_.
