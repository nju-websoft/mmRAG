The batting order is the main component of\na team's [offensive](/wiki/Offense_\\(sports\\) \"Offense \\(sports\\)\")\n[strategy](/wiki/Strategy \"Strategy\"). In [Major League\nBaseball](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball \"Major League Baseball\"), the batting\norder is set by the [manager](/wiki/Manager_\\(baseball\\) \"Manager\n\\(baseball\\)\"), who before the game begins must present the home plate umpire\nwith two copies of his team's **lineup card** , a card on which a team's\nstarting batting order is recorded. The home plate umpire keeps one copy of\nthe lineup card of each team, and gives the second copy to the opposing\nmanager. Once the home plate umpire gives the lineup cards to the opposing\nmanagers, the batting lineup is final and a manager can only make changes\nunder the [Official Baseball Rules](/wiki/Official_Baseball_Rules \"Official\nBaseball Rules\") governing substitutions.[1] If a team [bats out of\norder](/wiki/Batting_out_of_turn \"Batting out of turn\"), it is a violation of\nbaseball's rules and subject to penalty.\n\nAccording to _The Dickson Baseball Dictionary_ , a team has \"batted around\"\nwhen each of the nine batters in the team's lineup has made a [plate\nappearance](/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_\\(P\\)#plate_appearance \"Glossary of\nbaseball \\(P\\)\"), and the first batter is coming up again during a single\ninning.[2] [Dictionary.com](/wiki/Dictionary.com \"Dictionary.com\"), however,\ndefines \"bat around\" as \"to have every player in the lineup take a turn at bat\nduring a single inning.\"[3] It is not an official statistic. Opinions differ\nas to whether nine batters must get an at-bat, or if the opening batter must\nbat again for \"batting around\" to have occurred.[4]\n\nIn modern American [baseball](/wiki/Baseball \"Baseball\"), some batting\npositions have nicknames: \"leadoff\" for first, \"cleanup\" for fourth, and\n\"last\" for ninth. Others are known by the ordinal numbers or the term #-hole\n(3rd place hitter would be 3-hole). In similar fashion, the third, fourth, and\nfifth batters are often collectively referred to as the \"heart\" or \"meat\" of\nthe batting order, while the seventh, eighth, and ninth batters are called the\n\"bottom of the lineup,\" a designation generally referring both to their\nhitting position and to their typical lack of offensive prowess.[5]\n\nAt the start of each inning, the batting order resumes where it left off in\nthe previous inning, rather than resetting to start with the #1 hitter again.\nIf the current batter has not finished his at-bat, by either putting a ball in\nplay or being struck-out, and another baserunner becomes a third out, such as\nbeing picked-off or caught stealing, the current batter will lead off the next\ninning, with the pitch count reset to 0-0. While this ensures that the players\nall bat roughly the same number of times, the game will almost always end\nbefore the last cycle is complete, so that the #1 hitter (for example) almost\nalways has one plate appearance more than the #9 hitter, which is a\nsignificant enough difference to affect tactical decisions. This is not a\nperfect correlation to each batter's official count of \"at-bats,\" as a\nsacrifice (bunt or fly) that advances a runner, or a walk (base on balls or\nhit by pitch) is not recorded as an \"at-bat\" as these are largely out of the\nbatter's control and should not hurt his batting average (base hits per at-\nbats.)\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Development of the Set Batting Order\n    * 1.2 Contrast with Cricket\n  * 2 Positions in the lineup\n    * 2.1 #1\n    * 2.2 #2\n    * 2.3 #3\n    * 2.4 #4\n    * 2.5 #5, #6\n    * 2.6 #7, #8\n    * 2.7 #9\n  * 3 Bragan's Brainstorm\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Development of the Set Batting\nOrder[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Development of the Set Batting Order\")]\n\nEarly forms of baseball or [rounders](/wiki/Rounders \"Rounders\") from the mid\n19th-Century did not require a fixed batting order, any player who was not on\nbase could be called upon to bat.[6] The concept of a set batting order is\nsaid to have been invented by [Alexander\nCartwright](/wiki/Alexander_Cartwright \"Alexander Cartwright\"), who also\ninstituted rules such as the [foul ball](/wiki/Foul_ball \"Foul ball\") and\ntagging the runner (as opposed to pegging him with the ball), and devised the\n[shortstop](/wiki/Shortstop \"Shortstop\") position.[6] In the early days of\nbaseball, the rules did not require that the batting order be announced before\ngame time. This permitted strategic decisions regarding batting order to occur\nwhile the game was in progress. For example, [Cap Anson](/wiki/Cap_Anson \"Cap\nAnson\") was known to wait to see if the first two men got on base in the first\ninning. If they did not, he would wait and hit in the next inning.[7] However,\nin the 1880s, organized baseball began mandating that the batting order be\ndisclosed before the first pitch.[7]\n\nFor example, Rule 36 (\"The Batsman's Position--Order of Batting\") in _The\nPlaying Rules of Professional Base Ball Clubs_ of 1896 stated the following:\n_\" The Batsmen must take their positions within the batsmen's lines ... in the\norder in which they are named in the batting order, which batting order must\nbe submitted by the Captains of the opposing teams to the Umpire before the\ngame, and this batting order must be followed except in the case of a\nsubstitute player, in which case the substitute must take the place of the\noriginal player in the batting order. After the first inning the first striker\nin each inning shall be the batsman whose name follows that of the last man\nwho completed his turn ... in the preceding inning.\"_[8]\n\n### Contrast with\nCricket[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Contrast with Cricket\")]\n\nMain article: [Batting order (cricket)](/wiki/Batting_order_\\(cricket\\)\n\"Batting order \\(cricket\\)\")\n\nIn cricket, the batting order is generally fixed so that players are sure of\ntheir role within the team, but there is no obligation to submit a definitive\nbatting order and stick to it. A _batsman_ can be \"promoted\" to a higher spot\n(or conversely, demoted to a lower one) in the [batting\norder](/wiki/Batting_order_\\(cricket\\) \"Batting order \\(cricket\\)\") according\nto the team's wishes.[9]\n\nThe idea of a \"revolving\" batting order is unique to baseball, in which the\n[on-deck batter](/wiki/On-deck \"On-deck\") at the time the final out is made in\none inning becomes the lead-off batter (unless the current batter had not been\nstruck-out or put a ball in play, in which case he returns as the lead-off\nbatter with a 0-0 reset pitch count) in the next inning (unless his spot is\ntaken by a [pinch-hitter](/wiki/Pinch-hitter \"Pinch-hitter\")).\n\nIn the [shorter form](/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket \"Limited overs cricket\") of\ncricket, there is only one inning per side, while in the [longer\nform](/wiki/First-class_cricket \"First-class cricket\") each side bats a\nmaximum of two times. In a typical innings of this latter form, all eleven\nplayers on the team will have a chance to bat, and the innings finishes when\n10 players are out. In the team's second innings, the batting order is usually\nmaintained, but the team can make any changes it desires.\n\nAs in baseball, many batting order configurations are possible, but a standard\norder might be:\n\n  * Two opening batsmen - able players who can negotiate a typically difficult period of play.\n  * Four middle order batsmen - specialist batsmen who may be more attacking.\n  * A wicket-keeper - the equivalent of the catcher, who is also expected to contribute with the bat.\n  * Four bowlers - the equivalent of pitchers; players who may or may not have any ability with the bat. [10]\n\nIt has been noted that the concept of a batting order in baseball is\n\"profoundly democratic; no matter how good a hitter you are, you have to wait\nyour turn.\"[11] In that respect, although baseball, like cricket, \"may have\nbegun as a gentlemen's game,\" Americans gravitated toward baseball as a better\nembodiment of the country's egalitarian ideal, and as a symbol of cultural as\nwell as political independence from the British colonial legacy.[11]\n\nHowever, it should also be remembered that in cricket a single innings lasts\nhours or even days, and there are periods in which batting can be markedly\neasier or more difficult. A related factor is that a single ball is used in an\ninnings for around 80 overs (approximately 5 hours of play). At the beginning\nof an innings, therefore, when bowlers are fresh and the ball is hard, it\nwould be appreciably more challenging for the non-specialist batsmen to make\nan impact. Conversely, if such a player bats when the ball is old and the\nbowlers are tired, he can thrive, and this can often be a great source of\npleasure to spectators, as insult is added to injury for the other side.[12]\n\nFinally, in cricket, there is no such thing as a designated hitter, so even if\na bowler has no batting ability, he will still be required to bat, usually as\nthe last man in the order.\n\n## Positions in the\nlineup[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Positions in the lineup\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png) |  This section **possibly contains[original research](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research \"Wikipedia:No original research\")**.

The leadoff batter is\ntraditionally an individual with a high on-base percentage, plate discipline,\nbat control, good speed, and the ability to steal bases.[13] His goal is to\nensure the team has baserunners when the later, more powerful hitters come to\nbat. Once on base, his main goal is to get into scoring position (that is, 2nd\nor 3rd base) as quickly as possible, either through\n[steals](/wiki/Steal_\\(baseball\\) \"Steal \\(baseball\\)\"), [hit and run\nplays](/wiki/Hit_and_run_\\(baseball\\) \"Hit and run \\(baseball\\)\") or\nintelligent baserunning decisions, and then on to\n[score](/wiki/Run_\\(baseball\\) \"Run \\(baseball\\)\").\n\nHis need for a high [on-base percentage](/wiki/On-base_percentage \"On-base\npercentage\") (OBP) exceeds that of the other lineup spots. Because leadoff\nhitters are selected primarily for their speed and ability to reach base, they\nare typically not [power hitters](/wiki/Power_hitter \"Power hitter\"), but\n[contact hitters](/wiki/Contact_hitter \"Contact hitter\"). Leadoff hitters\ntypically hit mostly singles and doubles and draw walks to get on base.\nHowever, speed is not essential, as was shown by [Wade Boggs](/wiki/Wade_Boggs\n\"Wade Boggs\"), but it is highly desired among leadoff hitters.\n\nHowever, today's model for a leadoff hitter developed only gradually. An early\n\"job description\" for a leadoff hitter by baseball pioneer Henry Chadwick in\n1867 advised only, \"Let your first striker always be the coolest hand of the\nnine.\"[14] By 1898, though, a _[Sporting\nLife](/wiki/Sporting_Life_\\(American_newspaper\\) \"Sporting Life \\(American\nnewspaper\\)\")_ article noted, \"It is customary to have a small, active fellow\nwho can hit, run and steal bases, and also worry a pitcher into a preliminary\nbase on balls, as a leader in the list.\"[14]\n\nExamples of classic leadoff hitters are [Phil Rizzuto](/wiki/Phil_Rizzuto\n\"Phil Rizzuto\"), [Richie Ashburn](/wiki/Richie_Ashburn \"Richie Ashburn\"),\n[Maury Wills](/wiki/Maury_Wills \"Maury Wills\"), [Lou Brock](/wiki/Lou_Brock\n\"Lou Brock\"), [Pete Rose](/wiki/Pete_Rose \"Pete Rose\"), [Rod\nCarew](/wiki/Rod_Carew \"Rod Carew\"), [Tim Raines](/wiki/Tim_Raines \"Tim\nRaines\"), and [Ichiro Suzuki](/wiki/Ichiro_Suzuki \"Ichiro Suzuki\"), with some\nhaving somewhat more power ([Lou Whitaker](/wiki/Lou_Whitaker \"Lou Whitaker\"),\n[Rickey Henderson](/wiki/Rickey_Henderson \"Rickey Henderson\"), [Paul\nMolitor](/wiki/Paul_Molitor \"Paul Molitor\"), [Derek Jeter](/wiki/Derek_Jeter\n\"Derek Jeter\"), [Carlos Gómez](/wiki/Carlos_G%C3%B3mez \"Carlos Gómez\"),\n[Gerardo Parra](/wiki/Gerardo_Parra \"Gerardo Parra\"), [Johnny\nDamon](/wiki/Johnny_Damon \"Johnny Damon\")).\n\nIt should be noted that the term “leadoff hitter” can be used interchangeably\nto describe not only the first batter on the lineup card, but also the first\nbatter up in any particular inning. For example, if, in the second inning, the\nfifth batter in the lineup card is the first batter up, it will be said that\nhe is leading off or that he is the leadoff batter for that particular\ninning.[1]\n\n###\n#2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: #2\")]\n\nThe second batter is usually a [contact hitter](/wiki/Contact_hitter \"Contact\nhitter\") with the ability to [bunt](/wiki/Bunt_\\(baseball\\) \"Bunt\n\\(baseball\\)\") or [sacrifice](/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt \"Sacrifice bunt\") a\nbaserunner over or get a hit.[14] His main goal is to move the leadoff man\ninto scoring position and to avoid [grounding into double\nplays](/wiki/Grounded_into_double_play \"Grounded into double play\"). Managers\noften like to have a left-handed hitter bat second because of the potential\ngap in the infield defense caused by the first baseman holding the leadoff\nbatter. As early as 1892, it was recognized that a left-handed hitter in the\nsecond spot would make it easier for a man on base to steal second.[14] On a\nvery good team this batter can have characteristics of both a leadoff hitter\nand a power hitter ([Manny Machado](/wiki/Manny_Machado \"Manny Machado\"),\n[Curt Flood](/wiki/Curt_Flood \"Curt Flood\"), [Joe Morgan](/wiki/Joe_Morgan\n\"Joe Morgan\"), [Robin Yount](/wiki/Robin_Yount \"Robin Yount\"), [Alan\nTrammell](/wiki/Alan_Trammell \"Alan Trammell\")), in some such cases abandoning\nthe advantage of having a left-hand hitter in favor of a good right-handed\nhitter.\n\n###\n#3[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: #3\")]\n\nThe third batter, in the _three-hole_ , is generally the best all-around\nhitter on the team, often hitting for a high [batting\naverage](/wiki/Batting_average \"Batting average\") but not necessarily very\nfast. Part of his job is to reach base for the cleanup hitter, and part of it\nis to help drive in baserunners himself. Third-place hitters are best known\nfor \"keeping the inning alive\". However, in recent years, some managers have\ntended to put their best slugger in this position.\n\nTypically the greatest hitters for a combination of power and OBP on their\nteams bat third, as is shown by the use of such hitters as [Babe\nRuth](/wiki/Babe_Ruth \"Babe Ruth\"), [Mel Ott](/wiki/Mel_Ott \"Mel Ott\"), [Ted\nWilliams](/wiki/Ted_Williams \"Ted Williams\"), [Willie Mays](/wiki/Willie_Mays\n\"Willie Mays\"), [Chipper Jones](/wiki/Chipper_Jones \"Chipper Jones\"), [Barry\nBonds](/wiki/Barry_Bonds \"Barry Bonds\"), [Mickey Mantle](/wiki/Mickey_Mantle\n\"Mickey Mantle\"), [Carl Yastrzemski](/wiki/Carl_Yastrzemski \"Carl\nYastrzemski\"), [Albert Pujols](/wiki/Albert_Pujols \"Albert Pujols\"), [Joey\nVotto](/wiki/Joey_Votto \"Joey Votto\"), [Andrew\nMcCutchen](/wiki/Andrew_McCutchen \"Andrew McCutchen\"), [Miguel\nCabrera](/wiki/Miguel_Cabrera \"Miguel Cabrera\"), [Ken Griffey\nJr.](/wiki/Ken_Griffey_Jr. \"Ken Griffey Jr.\"), [Josh\nHamilton](/wiki/Josh_Hamilton \"Josh Hamilton\"), [Evan\nLongoria](/wiki/Evan_Longoria \"Evan Longoria\"), [José\nBautista](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Bautista \"José Bautista\"), [Edwin\nEncarnación](/wiki/Edwin_Encarnaci%C3%B3n \"Edwin Encarnación\"), [Mike\nTrout](/wiki/Mike_Trout \"Mike Trout\"), and [Hank Aaron](/wiki/Hank_Aaron \"Hank\nAaron\") in this position in the lineup. Even without the combination of\nextreme power ([Yogi Berra](/wiki/Yogi_Berra \"Yogi Berra\"), [Al\nKaline](/wiki/Al_Kaline \"Al Kaline\"), [George Brett](/wiki/George_Brett\n\"George Brett\")) or high batting average ([Ernie Banks](/wiki/Ernie_Banks\n\"Ernie Banks\"), [Harmon Killebrew](/wiki/Harmon_Killebrew \"Harmon Killebrew\"),\n[Johnny Bench](/wiki/Johnny_Bench \"Johnny Bench\"), [Mike\nSchmidt](/wiki/Mike_Schmidt \"Mike Schmidt\"), [Reggie\nJackson](/wiki/Reggie_Jackson \"Reggie Jackson\")) this batting position\ncontains an inordinate number of hitters who eventually become members of the\n[Baseball Hall of Fame](/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame \"Baseball Hall of Fame\").\n\n###\n#4[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: #4\")]\n\nThe fourth player in the batting order is known as the [cleanup\nhitter](/wiki/Cleanup_hitter \"Cleanup hitter\"), also known as the _cleanup\nspot_ and in modern baseball is almost always one of the best hitters on the\nteam, often the one with the [most power](/wiki/Slugging_percentage \"Slugging\npercentage\") and ability to drive in runs with extra-base hits (double,\ntriple, or home run).[13] Baseball managers tend to place hitters who are most\nlikely to reach base ahead of the clean-up man, so that the fourth batter can\n\"clean\" the bases by driving these baserunners home to score runs. His main\ngoal is to drive in runs, although he is expected to score runs as well.\nHitting cleanup requires an exceptional level of talent, and the ability to\ndeliver big hits in important situations (such as the bases loaded with two\nout). Examples of #4 hitters include [Lou Gehrig](/wiki/Lou_Gehrig \"Lou\nGehrig\"), [Eddie Mathews](/wiki/Eddie_Mathews \"Eddie Mathews\"), [Willie\nMcCovey](/wiki/Willie_McCovey \"Willie McCovey\"), [Billy\nWilliams](/wiki/Billy_Williams_\\(left_fielder\\) \"Billy Williams \\(left\nfielder\\)\"), [Tony Pérez](/wiki/Tony_P%C3%A9rez \"Tony Pérez\"), [Eddie\nMurray](/wiki/Eddie_Murray \"Eddie Murray\"), [Daniel\nMurphy](/wiki/Daniel_Murphy_\\(baseball\\) \"Daniel Murphy \\(baseball\\)\"), [Alex\nRodriguez](/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez \"Alex Rodriguez\"), [Prince\nFielder](/wiki/Prince_Fielder \"Prince Fielder\"), [David\nOrtiz](/wiki/David_Ortiz \"David Ortiz\"), [Edgar\nMartínez](/wiki/Edgar_Mart%C3%ADnez \"Edgar Martínez\"), and [Ryan\nHoward](/wiki/Ryan_Howard \"Ryan Howard\").\n\nThe theory behind the cleanup hitter is that, at the beginning of the game, if\nat least one of the first three batters reaches base with a [single-base\nhit](/wiki/Hit_\\(baseball\\) \"Hit \\(baseball\\)\") or\n[walk](/wiki/Walk_\\(baseball\\) \"Walk \\(baseball\\)\"), a home run will result in\ntwo or more runs rather than just one (a \"solo\" home run). If all three\nplayers reach base, thereby [loading the bases](/wiki/Bases_loaded \"Bases\nloaded\"), the cleanup hitter has the chance to hit a [grand\nslam](/wiki/Grand_slam_\\(baseball\\) \"Grand slam \\(baseball\\)\"), scoring four\nruns. But even without the grand slam, this batter can extend an inning with a\nhigh batting average and frequent walks.\n\nHowever, since home runs were a rarity before 1920, the concept of slotting a\nhome run hitter fourth was slow to develop. However, the need for a good run\nproducer in that position was recognized from the early days in baseball\nhistory, as demonstrated by Cap Anson generally penciling his name there.[14]\nAs power came to play a larger role in the game, the tendency to bat home run\nhitters fourth developed accordingly. In 1904, sportswriter [Tim\nMurnane](/wiki/Tim_Murnane \"Tim Murnane\") stated unequivocally that \"The heavy\nhitter of the team is located at the fourth place.\"[14]\n\nThe #3 and #4 hitters can often be switched in roles. For example, the 2011\nDetroit Tigers had Miguel Cabrera as their #4 hitter but moved him to the #3\nhitter after acquiring [Prince Fielder](/wiki/Prince_Fielder \"Prince Fielder\")\nas a free agent before the 2012 season.\n\n### #5,\n#6[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: #5, #6\")]\n\nThe fifth and sixth (and sometimes seventh) batters have traditionally been\n[RBI](/wiki/Run_batted_in \"Run batted in\") men, with the main goal of driving\nrunners home, especially with [sacrifice flies](/wiki/Sacrifice_fly \"Sacrifice\nfly\"). The 3rd, 4th and 5th hitters in the lineup are called the \"heart of the\norder\", signifying their collective ability to get on base, hit for power and\ndrive in runs. Modern [sabermetric](/wiki/Sabermetrics \"Sabermetrics\")\nbaseball theories suggests that even the 5th and 6th batters should have high\non-base percentages, though this approach has not been universally adopted.\nThe fifth batter is usually a team's second-best power hitter, and his purpose\nis often to \"protect\" the clean-up hitter in the batting order. He is expected\nto pose enough of a threat that the opposing team refrains from [intentionally\nwalking](/wiki/Intentional_base_on_balls \"Intentional base on balls\") the\nclean-up hitter in potential scoring situations. The sixth hitter serves as a\nbackup to the fifth hitter in case he fails to score runs or to drive more in\nhimself if another scoring opportunity presents itself.\n\n### #7,\n#8[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: #7, #8\")]\n\nThe seventh and eighth batters are often not as powerful as the earlier\nbatters, and do not have as high a batting average. They are often players who\nare in the lineup more because of their defensive ability (typically\n[catcher](/wiki/Catcher \"Catcher\"), [second baseman](/wiki/Second_baseman\n\"Second baseman\") or [shortstop](/wiki/Shortstop \"Shortstop\")) than their\nability as hitters. They are still expected to produce (as is the case for\n_any_ regular starter), but they have less pressure in those spots. The main\npressure on the eighth hitter comes when there are two outs: in this case, he\nmust battle the pitcher to get on base so that the ninth hitter can come up.\nThat way, even if the ninth hitter gets out, the top of the order comes up\nnext. Very often the #7 hitter is a catcher, commonly the slowest baserunner\non a team whose lack of speed would contribute to a large number of [double\nplays](/wiki/Double_play \"Double play\") higher in the order even if he is a\ngood hitter ([Bill Freehan](/wiki/Bill_Freehan \"Bill Freehan\")). The eighth\nbatter is often a good contact hitter, and can be used as a back-up #2 hitter.\nIn leagues without [designated hitters](/wiki/Designated_hitter \"Designated\nhitter\") (DHs), the [catcher](/wiki/Catcher \"Catcher\") often bats eighth, as\nthey are often employed for their defensive skills and handling of the\npitching staff, and tend to have a relatively low batting average. However,\nthis is by no means always the case. In a situation where the pitcher is\nbatting in the #9 slot, #8 hitters are sometimes intentionally walked to get\nto the pitcher's spot in the #9 hole; however, with two outs the opposing\npitcher is expected to battle the #8 hitter, so in the event of an out the\npitcher leads off the following inning.\n\n###\n#9[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: #9\")]\n\nIn the presence of the designated hitter, the ninth batter is often like the\nsecond leadoff. Ninth-hitters tend to be fast, and have a decent on-base\npercentage like the leadoff hitter.\n\nIn leagues where the DH rule is not in effect, the starting pitcher almost\nalways fills the ninth spot, although relief pitchers may occupy a different\nspot due to a [double switch](/wiki/Double_switch_\\(baseball\\) \"Double switch\n\\(baseball\\)\"). If there is a man on first or second base with fewer than two\nouts when the ninth hitter is up, he almost always bunts. However, a notable\nalternative exists to this, in which the pitcher or weakest hitter actually\nbats in the 8th slot, and another player with decent OBP and speed bats in the\n9th slot, thus creating a kind of second leadoff hitter, at the bottom of the\nlineup, that loops to the top of the order afterwards. This has been used\nsparingly in the major leagues, but was notably employed by [St. Louis\nCardinals](/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals \"St. Louis Cardinals\") manager [Tony La\nRussa](/wiki/Tony_La_Russa \"Tony La Russa\") in the second half of the 1998\nbaseball season, and again in August 2007 and in 2008, and by Milwaukee\nBrewers manager Ned Yost in 2008.[15][16] Joe Maddon is currently placing the\npitcher in the #8 spot during the beginning of the 2017 Cubs season.\n\n## Bragan's\nBrainstorm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Bragan's Brainstorm\")]\n\nIn 1957 major league manager [Bobby Bragan](/wiki/Bobby_Bragan \"Bobby Bragan\")\nplaced his best hitter in the leadoff position and the remainder of his lineup\nin descending batting average order. [Earnshaw Cook](/wiki/Earnshaw_Cook\n\"Earnshaw Cook\") in his 1966 book, _Percentage Baseball_ , claimed that, using\na computer, Bragan's lineup would result in 1 to 2 more wins per season. A\n[recent computer\nsimulation](https://sites.google.com/site/winningbaseballstrategies/)\ndemonstrates the superiority of Bragan's lineup.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batting_order_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014.
