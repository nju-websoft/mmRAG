        "# Demethylation\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**Demethylation** is the chemical process resulting in the removal of a\n[methyl group](/wiki/Methyl_group \"Methyl group\") (CH3) from a molecule.[1][2]\nA common way of demethylation is the replacement of a methyl group by a\nhydrogen atom, resulting in a net loss of one carbon and two hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe counterpart of demethylation is [methylation](/wiki/Methylation\n\"Methylation\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 In biochemistry\n  * 2 In organic chemistry\n    * 2.1 _O_ -Demethylation\n    * 2.2 _N_ -Demethylation\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 See also\n\n## In\nbiochemistry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Demethylation&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: In biochemistry\")]\n\nIn [biochemical](/wiki/Biochemical \"Biochemical\") systems, the process of\ndemethylation is [catalyzed](/wiki/Catalyst \"Catalyst\") by\n[demethylases](/wiki/Demethylase \"Demethylase\"). These enzymes oxidize\nN-methyl groups, which occur in [histones](/wiki/Histone \"Histone\") and some\nforms of DNA:\n\n    R2N-CH3 \\+ O → R2N-H + CH2O\n\nOne such oxidative enzyme family is the [cytochrome\nP450](/wiki/Cytochrome_P450 \"Cytochrome P450\").[3] [Alpha-ketoglutarate-\ndependent hydroxylases](/wiki/Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent_hydroxylase\n\"Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase\") are active for demethylation of\nDNA, operating by similar pathway. These reactions exploit the weak C-H bond\nadjacent to amines.\n\n## In organic\nchemistry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Demethylation&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: In organic chemistry\")]\n\n### _O_\n-Demethylation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Demethylation&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: O-Demethylation\")]\n\nDemethylation typically refers to cleavage of ethers, especially aryl ethers,\nalthough there are some exceptions, for instance _cf._\n\"[desipramine](/wiki/Desipramine \"Desipramine\")\".\n\nApparently, aryl ethers are pervasive in [lignin](/wiki/Lignin\n\"Lignin\")-derived compounds.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe reaction typically requires harsh conditions or harsh reagents. For\nexample, the methyl ether in [vanillin](/wiki/Vanillin \"Vanillin\") can be\nremoved by heating near 250 °C with strong base.[4] Stronger nucleophiles such\nas diorganophosphides (LiPPh2) also cleave aryl ethers under milder\nconditions.[5]\n\n[Boron tribromide](/wiki/Boron_tribromide \"Boron tribromide\") is a classical\nreagent for the dealkylation of methyl arylethers. The mechanism of ether\ndealkylation proceeds via the formation of a complex between the boron center\nand the ether oxygen followed by the elimination of an alkyl bromide to yield\na dibromo(organo)[borane](/wiki/Borane \"Borane\"). The dibromo(organo)borane\ncan then undergo [hydrolysis](/wiki/Hydrolysis \"Hydrolysis\") to give the\nalcohol or phenol, [boric acid](/wiki/Boric_acid \"Boric acid\"), and [hydrogen\nbromide](/wiki/Hydrogen_bromide \"Hydrogen bromide\") as products.[6]\n\n    ROR + BBr3 → RO+(−BBr3)R\n    RO+(−BBr3)R → ROBBr2 \\+ RBr\n    ROBBr2 \\+ 3 H2O → ROH + B(OH)3 \\+ 2 HBr\n\nMethyl esters also are susceptible to demethylation, which is usually achieved\nby [saponification](/wiki/Saponification \"Saponification\"). Highly specialized\ndemethylations are abundant such as the [Krapcho\ndecarboxylation](/wiki/Krapcho_decarboxylation \"Krapcho decarboxylation\"):\n\n    [![Krapcho reaction.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Krapcho_reaction.svg/400px-Krapcho_reaction.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Krapcho_reaction.svg)\n\n### _N_\n-Demethylation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Demethylation&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: N-Demethylation\")]\n\n_N_ -demethylation of 3° amines is by the [von Braun\nreaction](/wiki/Von_Braun_reaction \"Von Braun reaction\"), which uses\n[BrCN](/wiki/BrCN \"BrCN\") as the [reagent](/wiki/Reagent \"Reagent\") to give\nthe corresponding _[nor-](/wiki/Nor- \"Nor-\")_ derivatives. A modern variation\nof the [Von Braun reaction](/wiki/Von_Braun_reaction \"Von Braun reaction\") was\ndeveloped where BrCN was superseded by [ethyl\nchloroformate](/wiki/Ethyl_chloroformate \"Ethyl chloroformate\"). The\npreparation of [Paxil](/wiki/Paxil \"Paxil\") from [arecoline](/wiki/Arecoline\n\"Arecoline\") is an application of this reaction, as well as the synthesis of\n[GSK-372,475](/wiki/NS-2359 \"NS-2359\"), for example.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Demethylation&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Clayden, J.; Greeves, N.; Warren, S.; Wothers, P.
