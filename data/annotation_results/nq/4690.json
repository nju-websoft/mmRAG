The purpose of\nLent is the preparation of the believer for Easter through\n[prayer](/wiki/Christian_prayer \"Christian prayer\"), doing\n[penance](/wiki/Penance \"Penance\"), [mortifying the\nflesh](/wiki/Mortification_of_the_flesh \"Mortification of the flesh\"),\n[repentance](/wiki/Repentance_\\(theology\\) \"Repentance \\(theology\\)\") of sins,\n[almsgiving](/wiki/Almsgiving \"Almsgiving\"), and [self-\ndenial](/wiki/Asceticism \"Asceticism\").[1] This event is observed in the\n[Anglican](/wiki/Anglican_Communion \"Anglican Communion\"), [Eastern\nOrthodox](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox \"Eastern Orthodox\"), [Oriental\nOrthodox](/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox \"Oriental Orthodox\"),\n[Lutheran](/wiki/Lutheran \"Lutheran\"), [Methodist](/wiki/Methodist\n\"Methodist\"), and [Catholic](/wiki/Catholic \"Catholic\") Churches.[2][3][4]\nSome [Anabaptist](/wiki/Anabaptist \"Anabaptist\") and\n[evangelical](/wiki/Evangelical \"Evangelical\") churches also observe the\nLenten season.[5][6] Its institutional purpose is heightened in the annual\ncommemoration of [Holy Week](/wiki/Holy_Week \"Holy Week\"), marking the death,\nburial, and [resurrection of Jesus](/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus \"Resurrection\nof Jesus\"), which recalls the tradition and events of the [New\nTestament](/wiki/New_Testament \"New Testament\") beginning on [Palm\nSunday](/wiki/Palm_Sunday \"Palm Sunday\"), further climaxing on Jesus'\n[crucifixion](/wiki/Crucifixion \"Crucifixion\") on [Good\nFriday](/wiki/Good_Friday \"Good Friday\"), which ultimately culminates in the\njoyful celebration on [Easter Sunday](/wiki/Easter_Sunday \"Easter Sunday\") of\nthe [Resurrection of Jesus Christ](/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus_Christ\n\"Resurrection of Jesus Christ\").\n\nIn Lent, many Christians commit to [fasting](/wiki/Fasting \"Fasting\"), as well\nas giving up certain [luxuries](/wiki/Luxury_goods \"Luxury goods\") in order to\nreplicate the sacrifice of Jesus Christ's journey [into the\ndesert](/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament \"Life of Jesus in the New\nTestament\") for 40 days.[7][8][9] Many Christians also add a Lenten spiritual\ndiscipline, such as reading a [daily devotional](/wiki/Daily_devotional \"Daily\ndevotional\") or praying through a [Lenten calendar](/wiki/Lenten_calendar\n\"Lenten calendar\"), to draw themselves near to God.[10][11] The [Stations of\nthe Cross](/wiki/Stations_of_the_Cross \"Stations of the Cross\"), a devotional\ncommemoration of [Christ's carrying the Cross](/wiki/Christ_Carrying_the_Cross\n\"Christ Carrying the Cross\") and of [his execution](/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus\n\"Crucifixion of Jesus\"), are often observed.

Throughout [Christendom](/wiki/Christendom\n\"Christendom\"), some adherents mark the season with the traditional abstention\nfrom the consumption of meat, most notably among Lutherans, Roman Catholics\nand Anglicans.[12][13][14]\n\nLent is traditionally described as lasting for 40 days, in commemoration of\nthe [40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert](/wiki/Temptation_of_Jesus\n\"Temptation of Jesus\"), according to the Gospels of\n[Matthew](/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew \"Gospel of Matthew\"),\n[Mark](/wiki/Gospel_of_Mark \"Gospel of Mark\") and [Luke](/wiki/Gospel_of_Luke\n\"Gospel of Luke\"), before beginning his [public\nministry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Jesus \"Ministry of Jesus\"), during which he\nendured temptation by [Satan](/wiki/Satan \"Satan\").[15][16]\n\nHoly Week and the season of Lent, depending on the Christian denomination and\nlocal custom, end with Easter Vigil at sundown on Holy Saturday, on the\nmorning of Easter Sunday, or at the midnight between them.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Etymology\n  * 2 Duration and traditions\n    * 2.1 Roman Catholicism\n    * 2.2 Protestantism and Western Orthodoxy\n    * 2.3 Eastern Orthodoxy and Byzantine Rite\n    * 2.4 Oriental Orthodoxy\n  * 3 Other related fasting periods\n  * 4 Associated customs\n  * 5 Omission of Gloria and Alleluia\n  * 6 Veiling of religious images\n  * 7 Pre-Lenten festivals\n  * 8 Fasting and abstinence\n  * 9 Media coverage\n  * 10 Holy days within the season of Lent\n    * 10.1 Easter Triduum\n  * 11 Vestments\n  * 12 See also\n  * 13 References\n  * 14 External links\n\n## Etymology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Etymology\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Holy_Week_procession_in_Granada%2C_Nicaragua.jpg/220px-\nHoly_Week_procession_in_Granada%2C_Nicaragua.jpg)](/wiki/File:Holy_Week_procession_in_Granada,_Nicaragua.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Holy_Week_procession_in_Granada,_Nicaragua.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLent celebrants carrying out a street procession during [Holy\nWeek](/wiki/Holy_Week \"Holy Week\"), in [Granada,\nNicaragua](/wiki/Granada,_Nicaragua \"Granada, Nicaragua\").

A dated\nterm in [German](/wiki/German_language \"German language\"), _Lenz_ ([Old High\nGerman](/wiki/Old_High_German \"Old High German\")\n_[lenzo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lenzo \"wikt:lenzo\")_), is also\nrelated. According to the _[Oxford English\nDictionary](/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary \"Oxford English Dictionary\")_ ,\n'the shorter form (? Old Germanic type *_laŋgito_ \\- , *_laŋgiton_ -) seems to\nbe a derivative of *_laŋgo_ \\- long ... and may possibly have reference to the\nlengthening of the days as characterizing the season of spring'. The origin of\nthe -_en_ element is less clear: it may simply be a [suffix](/wiki/Suffix\n\"Suffix\"), or _lencten_ may originally have been a compound of *_laŋgo_ \\-\n'long' and an otherwise little attested word *-_tino_ , meaning 'day'.[19]\n\nIn languages spoken where Christianity was earlier established, such as\n[Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\") and [Latin](/wiki/Latin\n\"Latin\"), the term signifies the period dating from the 40th day before\nEaster. In modern Greek the term is _Σαρακοστή_ , derived from the earlier\n_Τεσσαρακοστή_ , meaning \"fortieth\". The corresponding word in Latin,\n_quadragesima_ (\"fortieth\"), is the origin of the term used in Latin-derived\nlanguages and in some others: for example, [Croatian](/wiki/Croatian_language\n\"Croatian language\") _korizma_ , French _carême_ ,\n[Irish](/wiki/Irish_language \"Irish language\") _carghas_ , Italian _quaresima_\n, [Portuguese](/wiki/Portuguese_language \"Portuguese language\") _quaresma_ ,\n[Albanian](/wiki/Albanian_language \"Albanian language\") _kreshma_ ,\n[Romanian](/wiki/Romanian_language \"Romanian language\") _păresimi_ , Spanish\n_cuaresma_ , [Basque](/wiki/Basque_language \"Basque language\") _garizuma_ and\n[Welsh](/wiki/Welsh_language \"Welsh language\") _c(a)rawys_.\n\nIn other languages, the name used refers to the activity associated with the\nseason. Thus it is called \"fasting period\" in [Czech](/wiki/Czech_language\n\"Czech language\") (_postní doba_), [German](/wiki/German_language \"German\nlanguage\") (_Fastenzeit_), and [Norwegian](/wiki/Norwegian_language \"Norwegian\nlanguage\") (_fasten_ /_fastetid_), and it is called \"great fast\" in\n[Polish](/wiki/Polish_language \"Polish language\") (_wielki post_) and\n[Russian](/wiki/Russian_language \"Russian language\") (великий пост – _veliki\npost_).\n\nThe terms used in [Filipino](/wiki/Filipino_language \"Filipino language\") are\n_kuwaresma_ (from the Spanish) and _Mahál na Araw_ (\"precious/great days\");\nthe latter term is also used specifically for Holy Week.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Duration and\ntraditions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section:\nDuration and traditions\")]\n\nVarious Christian [denominations](/wiki/Christian_denomination \"Christian\ndenomination\") calculate the 40 days of Lent differently. The way they observe\nLent also differs.\n\n### Roman Catholicism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Roman Catholicism\")]\n\nIn the Roman Rite Lent starts on Ash Wednesday and finishes on Holy Saturday.\nThis comprises a period of 46 days. This includes 6 Sundays which are not\nconsidered part of Lent because Sundays are days of celebration for\nCatholics.[20][_[not in citation given](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\nIn the [Ambrosian Rite](/wiki/Ambrosian_Rite \"Ambrosian Rite\"), Lent begins on\nthe Sunday that follows what is celebrated as Ash Wednesday in the rest of the\n[Latin Catholic Church](/wiki/Latin_Church \"Latin Church\"), and ends as in the\nRoman Rite, thus being of 40 days, counting the Sundays but not [Holy\nThursday](/wiki/Holy_Thursday \"Holy Thursday\"). The day for beginning the\nLenten fast is the following Monday, the first weekday in Lent. The special\nAsh Wednesday fast is transferred to the first Friday of the Ambrosian Lent.\nUntil this rite was revised by Saint [Charles Borromeo](/wiki/Charles_Borromeo\n\"Charles Borromeo\") the liturgy of the First Sunday of Lent was festive,\ncelebrated in white [vestments](/wiki/Vestment \"Vestment\") with chanting of\nthe [Gloria in Excelsis](/wiki/Gloria_in_Excelsis \"Gloria in Excelsis\") and\n[Alleluia](/wiki/Alleluia_\\(chant\\) \"Alleluia \\(chant\\)\"), in line with the\nrecommendation in [Matthew 6:16](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+6:16), \"When you\nfast, do not look gloomy\".[21][22][23]\n\nThe period of Lent observed in the [Eastern Catholic\nChurches](/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches \"Eastern Catholic Churches\")\ncorresponds to that in other churches of [Eastern\nChristianity](/wiki/Eastern_Christianity \"Eastern Christianity\") that have\nsimilar traditions.\n\n### Protestantism and Western\nOrthodoxy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section:\nProtestantism and Western Orthodoxy\")]\n\nIn Protestant and Western Orthodox Churches, the season of Lent lasts from\n[Ash Wednesday](/wiki/Ash_Wednesday \"Ash Wednesday\") to [Holy\nSaturday](/wiki/Holy_Saturday \"Holy Saturday\").[24][25] This calculation makes\nLent last 46 days, if the 6 Sundays are included, but only 40, if they are\nexcluded,[26] This definition is still that of the [Anglican\nChurch](/wiki/Anglican_Communion \"Anglican Communion\"),[27] [Lutheran\nChurch](/wiki/Lutheran_World_Federation \"Lutheran World Federation\"),[28]\n[Methodist Church](/wiki/World_Methodist_Council \"World Methodist\nCouncil\"),[29] and [Western Rite Orthodox Church](/wiki/Western-\nRite_Orthodox_Churches \"Western-Rite Orthodox Churches\").[30]\n\n### Eastern Orthodoxy and Byzantine\nRite[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section:\nEastern Orthodoxy and Byzantine Rite\")]\n\nMain article: [Great Lent](/wiki/Great_Lent \"Great Lent\")\n\nIn the [Byzantine Rite](/wiki/Byzantine_Rite \"Byzantine Rite\"), i.e., the\n[Eastern Orthodox](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church \"Eastern Orthodox Church\")\n[Great Lent](/wiki/Great_Lent \"Great Lent\") (Greek: Μεγάλη Τεσσαρακοστή or\nΜεγάλη Νηστεία, meaning \"Great 40 Days\" and \"Great Fast\" respectively) is the\nmost important fasting season in the church year.[31]\n\nThe 40 days of Great Lent includes Sundays, and begins on [Clean\nMonday](/wiki/Clean_Monday \"Clean Monday\") and are immediately followed by\nwhat are considered distinct periods of fasting, [Lazarus\nSaturday](/wiki/Lazarus_Saturday \"Lazarus Saturday\") and [Palm\nSunday](/wiki/Palm_Sunday \"Palm Sunday\"), which in turn are followed\nstraightway by [Holy Week](/wiki/Holy_Week \"Holy Week\"). Great Lent is broken\nonly after the Paschal (Easter) Divine Liturgy.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church maintains the traditional Church's teaching on\nfasting. The rules for lenten fasting are the monastic rules. Fasting in the\nOrthodox Church is more than simply abstaining from certain foods. During the\nGreat Lent Orthodox Faithful intensify their prayers and spiritual exercises,\ngo to church services more often, study the Scriptures and the works of the\n[Church Fathers](/wiki/Church_Fathers \"Church Fathers\") in depth, limit their\nentertainment and spendings and focus on charity and good works.\n\n### Oriental Orthodoxy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Oriental Orthodoxy\")]\n\nAmong the [Oriental Orthodox](/wiki/Oriental_Orthodoxy \"Oriental Orthodoxy\"),\nthere are various local traditions regarding Lent.

Some Christian denominations, such as The Way International and Logos Apostolic Church of God,[36] as well as [Anglican](/wiki/Anglicanism \"Anglicanism\") scholar [E. W. Bullinger](/wiki/E._W._Bullinger \"E. W.

The fast was initially undertaken\nby the [catechumens](/wiki/Catechumen \"Catechumen\") to prepare them for the\nreception of this [sacrament](/wiki/Sacrament \"Sacrament\"). Later, the period\nof fasting from [Good Friday](/wiki/Good_Friday \"Good Friday\") until Easter\nDay was extended to six days, to correspond with the six weeks of training\nnecessary to give the final instruction to those\n[converts](/wiki/Religious_conversion \"Religious conversion\") who were to be\nbaptized.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[Converts to Christianity](/wiki/Conversion_to_Christianity \"Conversion to\nChristianity\") followed a strict [catechumenate](/wiki/Catechumenate\n\"Catechumenate\") or period of instruction and discipline prior to receiving\nthe [sacrament](/wiki/Sacrament \"Sacrament\") of [baptism](/wiki/Baptism\n\"Baptism\"), sometimes lasting up to three years.[38] In\n[Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\") near the close of the fourth century,\nclasses were held throughout Lent for three hours each day.

In response, the Lenten fast and practices of\n[self-renunciation](/wiki/Asceticism#Christianity \"Asceticism\") were required\nannually of all Christians, both to show solidarity with the catechumens, and\nfor their own spiritual benefit.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Associated customs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Associated customs\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lenten_shrouds.jpeg/220px-\nLenten_shrouds.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Lenten_shrouds.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Lenten_shrouds.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStatues and icons veiled in violet shrouds for [Passiontide](/wiki/Passiontide\n\"Passiontide\") in [St Pancras Church,\nIpswich](/wiki/St_Pancras_Church,_Ipswich \"St Pancras Church, Ipswich\"),\nEngland\n\nThere are traditionally 40 days in Lent; these are marked by fasting, both\nfrom foods and festivities, and by other acts of [penance](/wiki/Penance\n\"Penance\"). The three traditional practices to be taken up with renewed vigour\nduring Lent are [prayer](/wiki/Prayer \"Prayer\") ([justice](/wiki/Justice\n\"Justice\") towards God), fasting (justice towards self), and\n[almsgiving](/wiki/Almsgiving \"Almsgiving\") (justice towards neighbours).\n\nHowever, in modern times, observers give up partaking in [vices](/wiki/Vice\n\"Vice\") and often invest the time or money saved in\n[charitable](/wiki/Charitable_cause \"Charitable cause\") purposes or\norganizations.[39]\n\nIn addition, some believers add a regular spiritual discipline, to bring them\ncloser to God, such as reading a Lenten [daily\ndevotional](/wiki/Daily_devotional \"Daily devotional\").[10] Another practice\ncommonly added is the singing of the [Stabat Mater](/wiki/Stabat_Mater \"Stabat\nMater\") hymn in designated groups.

The Gloria is used on\n[Maundy Thursday](/wiki/Maundy_Thursday \"Maundy Thursday\"), to the\naccompaniment of bells, which then fall silent until the _Gloria in excelsis_\nof the [Easter Vigil](/wiki/Easter_Vigil \"Easter Vigil\").[42]\n\nThe Lutheran [Divine Service](/wiki/Divine_Service_\\(Lutheran\\) \"Divine\nService \\(Lutheran\\)\"), the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and the\nPresbyterian service of worship associate the _[Alleluia](/wiki/Alleluia\n\"Alleluia\")_ with joy and omits it entirely throughout Lent,[43][44] not only\nat Mass but also in the [canonical hours](/wiki/Canonical_hours \"Canonical\nhours\") as well as outside the liturgy. Before 1970, the omission began with\n[Septuagesima](/wiki/Septuagesima \"Septuagesima\"). The word \"Alleluia\" at the\nbeginning and end of the Acclamation Before the\n[Gospel](/wiki/Gospel_\\(liturgy\\) \"Gospel \\(liturgy\\)\") at Mass is replaced by\nanother phrase. Before 1970, the whole Acclamation was omitted and was\nreplaced by a [Tract](/wiki/Tract_\\(liturgy\\) \"Tract \\(liturgy\\)\"). Again,\nbefore 1970, the word \"Alleluia\" normally added to the _[Gloria\nPatri](/wiki/Gloria_Patri \"Gloria Patri\")_ at the beginning of each Hour of\nthe Liturgy of the Hours was replaced by the phrase _Laus tibi, Domine, rex\naeternae gloriae_ (Praise to you, O Lord, king of eternal glory). Now it is\nsimply omitted.\n\nUntil the [Ambrosian Rite](/wiki/Ambrosian_Rite \"Ambrosian Rite\") was revised\nby Saint [Charles Borromeo](/wiki/Charles_Borromeo \"Charles Borromeo\") the\nliturgy of the First Sunday of Lent was festive, celebrated with chanting of\nthe Gloria and Alleluia, in line with the recommendation in [Matthew\n6:16](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+6:16), \"When you fast, do not look\ngloomy\".[21][22][23]\n\nIn the [Byzantine Rite](/wiki/Byzantine_Rite \"Byzantine Rite\"), the Gloria\n([Great Doxology](/wiki/Great_Doxology \"Great Doxology\")) continues to be used\nin its normal place in the [Matins](/wiki/Matins \"Matins\") service, and the\nAlleluia appears all the more frequently, replacing \"God is the Lord\" at\nMatins.\n\n## Veiling of religious\nimages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section:\nVeiling of religious images\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e6/Minister_prostrates_at_the_start_of_United_Methodist_Good_Friday_liturgy.jpg/220px-\nMinister_prostrates_at_the_start_of_United_Methodist_Good_Friday_liturgy.jpg)](/wiki/File:Minister_prostrates_at_the_start_of_United_Methodist_Good_Friday_liturgy.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Minister_prostrates_at_the_start_of_United_Methodist_Good_Friday_liturgy.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nA United Methodist minister [prostrates](/wiki/Prostration \"Prostration\") at\nthe start of the [Good Friday](/wiki/Good_Friday \"Good Friday\") liturgy at\nHoly Family Church, in accordance with the rubrics in the [Book of\nWorship](/wiki/The_United_Methodist_Book_of_Worship_\\(1992\\) \"The United\nMethodist Book of Worship \\(1992\\)\").

Though perhaps uncommon\nin the United States of America, this pious practice is consistently observed\nin [Goa](/wiki/Goa,_India \"Goa, India\"), Malta, Peru, the Philippines (the\nlatter only for the entire duration of Holy Week, with the exception of\nprocessional images), and in the Spanish cities: [Barcelona](/wiki/Barcelona\n\"Barcelona\"), [Málaga](/wiki/M%C3%A1laga \"Málaga\"), and\n[Seville](/wiki/Seville \"Seville\"). In Ireland, before [Vatican\nII](/wiki/Vatican_II \"Vatican II\"), when impoverished rural Catholic convents\nand parishes could not afford purple fabrics, they resorted to either removing\nthe statues altogether or, if too heavy or bothersome, turned the statues to\nface the wall. As is popular custom, the 14 [Stations of the\nCross](/wiki/Stations_of_the_Cross \"Stations of the Cross\") plaques on the\nwalls are not veiled.\n\nCrucifixes made before the time of [Saint Francis of\nAssisi](/wiki/Saint_Francis_of_Assisi \"Saint Francis of Assisi\") did not have\na corpus (body of Christ) and therefore were adorned with jewels and\ngemstones, which was referred to as _Crux Gemmatae_. To keep the faithful from\nadoring the crucifixes elaborated with ornamentation, veiling it in royal\npurple fabrics came into place. The violet colour later evolved as a color of\npenance and mourning.\n\nFurther liturgical changes in modernity reduced such observances to the last\nweek of [Passiontide](/wiki/Passiontide \"Passiontide\"). In parishes that could\nafford only small quantities of violet fabrics, only the heads of the statues\nwere veiled. If no violet fabrics could be afforded at all, then the religious\nstatues and images were turned around facing the wall. Flowers were always\nremoved as a sign of solemn mourning.\n\nIn the [pre-1992 Methodist\nliturgy](/wiki/Book_of_Worship_for_Church_and_Home_\\(1965\\) \"Book of Worship\nfor Church and Home \\(1965\\)\") and pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, the last\ntwo weeks of Lent are known as [Passiontide](/wiki/Passiontide \"Passiontide\"),\na period beginning on the Fifth Sunday in Lent, which in the 1962 edition of\nthe [Roman Missal](/wiki/Roman_Missal \"Roman Missal\") is called the First\nSunday in Passiontide and in earlier editions Passion Sunday. All statues (and\nin England paintings as well) in the church were traditionally veiled in\nviolet. This was seen as in keeping with the Gospel of that Sunday ([John\n8:46–59](http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=John+8:46–59:46&version=nrsv)), in\nwhich Jesus \"hid himself\" from the people.\n\nWithin many churches in the United States of America, after the Second Vatican\nCouncil, the need to veil statues or crosses became increasingly irrelevant\nand was deemed unnecessary by some [diocesan](/wiki/Diocesan \"Diocesan\")\nbishops. As a result, the veils were removed at the singing of the [Gloria in\nExcelsis Deo](/wiki/Gloria_in_Excelsis_Deo \"Gloria in Excelsis Deo\") during\nthe Easter Vigil. In 1970, the name \"Passiontide\" was dropped, although the\nlast two weeks are markedly different from the rest of the season, and\ncontinuance of the tradition of veiling images is left to the discretion of a\ncountry's conference of bishops or even to individual parishes as pastors may\nwish.\n\nOn [Good Friday](/wiki/Good_Friday \"Good Friday\"), the Anglican, Lutheran, and\nMethodist churches traditionally veiled \"all pictures, statutes, and the cross\nare covered in mourning black\", while \"the chancel and altar coverings are\nreplaced with black, and altar candles are extinguished\". The fabrics are then\n\"replaced with white on [sunrise](/wiki/Sunrise \"Sunrise\") on [Easter\nSunday](/wiki/Easter_Sunday \"Easter Sunday\")\".[45]\n\n## Pre-Lenten festivals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Pre-Lenten festivals\")]\n\nMain article: [Shrovetide](/wiki/Shrovetide \"Shrovetide\")\n\nFurther information: [Carnival](/wiki/Carnival \"Carnival\"), [Mardi\nGras](/wiki/Mardi_Gras \"Mardi Gras\"), [Swabian-Alemannic-\nFastnacht](/wiki/Swabian-Alemannic-Fastnacht \"Swabian-Alemannic-Fastnacht\"),\n[Maslenitsa](/wiki/Maslenitsa \"Maslenitsa\"), [Pancake Day](/wiki/Pancake_Day\n\"Pancake Day\"), and [Baklahorani](/wiki/Baklahorani \"Baklahorani\")\n\nThe carnival celebrations which in many cultures traditionally precede Lent\nare seen as a last opportunity for excess before Lent begins.

Sometimes, it is the\npeak of the pre-Lenten festival, while sometimes it is largely occupied with\npreparations for Lent. The observances vary from culture to culture, and even\nfrom town to town.\n\nOriginally, in Lebanon and Syria, the last Thursday preceding Lent was called\n\"Khamis el zakara\". For Catholics, it was meant to be a day of remembrance of\nthe dead ones. However, _zakara_ (which means \"remembrance\", in Arabic) was\ngradually replaced by _sakara_ (meaning \"getting drunk\" in Arabic), and so the\noccasion came to be known as _[Khamis el sakara](/wiki/Khamis_el_sakara\n\"Khamis el sakara\")_ , wherein celebrants indulge themselves with [alcoholic\nbeverages](/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage \"Alcoholic beverage\").\n\n## Fasting and\nabstinence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lent&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Fasting and abstinence\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Brooklyn_Museum_-\n_Jesus_Tempted_in_the_Wilderness_%28J%C3%A9sus_tent%C3%A9_dans_le_d%C3%A9sert%29_-_James_Tissot_-\n_overall.jpg/220px-Brooklyn_Museum_-\n_Jesus_Tempted_in_the_Wilderness_%28J%C3%A9sus_tent%C3%A9_dans_le_d%C3%A9sert%29_-_James_Tissot_-\n_overall.jpg)](/wiki/File:Brooklyn_Museum_-\n_Jesus_Tempted_in_the_Wilderness_\\(J%C3%A9sus_tent%C3%A9_dans_le_d%C3%A9sert\\)_-_James_Tissot_-\n_overall.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Brooklyn_Museum_-\n_Jesus_Tempted_in_the_Wilderness_\\(J%C3%A9sus_tent%C3%A9_dans_le_d%C3%A9sert\\)_-_James_Tissot_-\n_overall.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Jesus Tempted in the Wilderness (Jésus tenté dans le désert)_ , [James\nTissot](/wiki/James_Tissot \"James Tissot\"), [Brooklyn\nMuseum](/wiki/Brooklyn_Museum \"Brooklyn Museum\")\n\nFurther information: [Christian dietary laws](/wiki/Christian_dietary_laws\n\"Christian dietary laws\")\n\nFasting during Lent was more prominent in ancient times than today. [Socrates\nScholasticus](/wiki/Socrates_Scholasticus \"Socrates Scholasticus\") reports\nthat in some places, all animal products were strictly forbidden, while\nvarious others permitted fish, or fish and fowl, others prohibited fruit and\neggs, and still others permitted only bread. In many places, the observant\nabstained from food for a whole day until the evening, and at sunset, Western\nChristians traditionally broke the Lenten fast, which was often known as the\n[Black Fast](/wiki/Black_Fast \"Black Fast\").[46][47] In [India](/wiki/India\n\"India\") and [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan \"Pakistan\"), many Christians continue\nthis practice of fasting until sunset on [Ash Wednesday](/wiki/Ash_Wednesday\n\"Ash Wednesday\") and [Good Friday](/wiki/Good_Friday \"Good Friday\"), with some\nfasting in this manner throughout the whole season of Lent.[48]\n\nFor other Latin Catholics, by the early 20th century the theoretical\nobligation of the penitential fast throughout Lent except on Sundays was to\ntake only one full meal a day. In addition, a smaller meal, called a\n[collation](/wiki/Collation_\\(meal\\) \"Collation \\(meal\\)\"), was allowed in the\nevening, and a cup of some beverage, accompanied by a little bread, in the\nmorning. In practice, this obligation, which was a matter of custom rather\nthan of written law, was not observed strictly.[49] The [1917 Code of Canon\nLaw](/wiki/1917_Code_of_Canon_Law \"1917 Code of Canon Law\") allowed the full\nmeal on a fasting day to be taken at any hour and to be supplemented by two\ncollations, with the quantity and the quality of the food to be determined by\nlocal custom. The Lenten fast ended on [Holy Saturday](/wiki/Holy_Saturday\n\"Holy Saturday\") at noon. Only those aged 21 to 59 were obliged to fast. As\nwith all merely ecclesiastical laws, particular difficulties, such as\nstrenuous work or illness, excused one from observance, and a dispensation\nfrom the law could be granted by a bishop or parish priest. In addition to\nfasting, abstinence from meat was to be observed on Ash Wednesday and on\nFridays and Saturdays in Lent.[50] A rule of thumb is that the two collations\nshould not add up to the equivalent of another full meal. Rather portions were\nto be: \"sufficient to sustain strength, but not sufficient to satisfy\nhunger\".[51] The [apostolic constitution](/wiki/Apostolic_constitution\n\"Apostolic constitution\") _Paenitemini_ of 17 February 1966 reduced the\nfasting days to two: Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, and allowed [episcopal\nconferences](/wiki/Episcopal_conference \"Episcopal conference\") to \"substitute\nabstinence and fast wholly or in part with other forms of penitence and\nespecially works of charity and the exercises of piety\".[52] This was made\npart of the [1983 Code of Canon Law](/wiki/1983_Code_of_Canon_Law \"1983 Code\nof Canon Law\"), which made obligatory fasting for those aged between 18 and\n59, and abstinence for those aged 14 and upward.[53] The [Irish Catholic\nBishops' Conference](/wiki/Irish_Catholic_Bishops%27_Conference \"Irish\nCatholic Bishops' Conference\") decided to allow other forms of Friday penance\nto replace that of abstinence from meat, whether in Lent or outside Lent,\nsuggesting alternatives such as abstaining from some other food, or from\nalcohol or smoking; making a special effort at participating in family prayer\nor in Mass; making the [Stations of the Cross](/wiki/Stations_of_the_Cross\n\"Stations of the Cross\"); or helping the poor, sick, old, or lonely.[54] The\n[Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and\nWales](/wiki/Catholic_Bishops%27_Conference_of_England_and_Wales \"Catholic\nBishops' Conference of England and Wales\") made a similar ruling in 1985[55]\nbut decided in 2011 to restore the traditional year-round Friday abstinence\nfrom meat.[56] The [United States Conference of Catholic\nBishops](/wiki/United_States_Conference_of_Catholic_Bishops \"United States\nConference of Catholic Bishops\") has maintained the rule of abstention from\nmeat on Friday only during Lent.[57]\n\nMany Lutheran Churches advocate fasting during designated times such as\nLent,[9][58] especially on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.[59][9][60][61] _A\nHandbook for the Discipline of Lent_ delineates the following Lutheran fasting\nguidelines:[12]\n\n>   1. Fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with only one simple meal during\n> the day, usually without meat.\n>   2. Refrain from eating meat (bloody foods) on all Fridays in Lent,\n> substituting fish for example.\n>   3. Eliminate a food or food group for the entire season. Especially\n> consider saving rich and fatty foods for Easter.\n>   4. Consider not eating before receiving Communion in Lent.\n>   5. Abstain from or limit a favorite activity (television, movies, etc.)\n> for the entire season, and spend more time in prayer, Bible study, and\n> reading devotional material.[12]\n>\n\nThe historic Methodist homilies regarding the [Sermon on the\nMount](/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount \"Sermon on the Mount\") stress the importance\nof the Lenten fast, which begins on Ash Wednesday.[62] The United Methodist\nChurch therefore states that:\n\n> There is a strong biblical base for fasting, particularly during the 40 days\n> of Lent leading to the celebration of Easter. Jesus, as part of his\n> spiritual preparation, went into the wilderness and fasted 40 days and 40\n> nights, according to the Gospels.[63]\n\n[Good Friday](/wiki/Good_Friday \"Good Friday\"), which is towards the end of\nthe Lenten season, is traditionally an important day of communal fasting for\nMethodists.[64] Rev. Jacqui King, the minister of Nu Faith Community United\nMethodist Church in Houston explained the philosophy of fasting during Lent as\n\"I'm not skipping a meal because in place of that meal I'm actually dining\nwith God\".[65]\n\nMany of the Churches in the Reformed tradition retained the Lenten fast in its\nentirety.[8] The [Reformed Church in America](/wiki/Reformed_Church_in_America\n\"Reformed Church in America\") describes the first day of Lent, [Ash\nWednesday](/wiki/Ash_Wednesday \"Ash Wednesday\"), as a day \"focused on prayer,\nfasting, and repentance\" and considers fasting a focus of the whole Lenten\nseason,[66] as demonstrated in the \"Invitation to Observe a Lenten\nDiscipline\", found in the Reformed liturgy for the Ash Wednesday service,\nwhich is read by the presider:[67]\n\n> We begin this holy season by acknowledging our need for repentance and our\n> need for the love and forgiveness shown to us in Jesus Christ. I invite you,\n> therefore, in the name of Christ, to observe a Holy Lent, by self-\n> examination and penitence, by prayer and fasting, by practicing works of\n> love, and by reading and reflecting on God's Holy Word.[67]\n\n[Good Friday](/wiki/Good_Friday \"Good Friday\"), which is towards the end of\nthe Lenten season, is traditionally an important day of communal fasting for\nadherents of the Reformed faith.[64]\n\nDuring the [early Middle Ages](/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages \"Early Middle Ages\"),\neggs, dairy products, and meat were generally forbidden. In favour of the\ntraditional practice, observed both in East and West, [Thomas\nAquinas](/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas \"Thomas Aquinas\") argued that \"they afford\ngreater pleasure as food [than fish], and greater nourishment to the human\nbody, so that from their consumption there results a greater surplus available\nfor seminal matter, which when abundant becomes a great incentive to\nlust.\"[68] Aquinas also authorized the consumption of [candy](/wiki/Candy\n\"Candy\") during Lent, because \"sugared spices\" (such as\n[comfits](/wiki/Comfits \"Comfits\")) were, in his opinion, digestive aids on\npar with medicine rather than food.[69]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Bruegel_Lent.jpg/220px-\nBruegel_Lent.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bruegel_Lent.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bruegel_Lent.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Jousting](/wiki/Jousting \"Jousting\") against [Carnival](/wiki/Carnival\n\"Carnival\") is represented by a fat man on a beer barrel who wears a huge meat\npie as headdress; Lent is represented by a thin gaunt woman on a cart (shown\nhere) bearing Lenten fare: mussels, pretzels, and waffles. Oil painting _[The\nFight Between Carnival and Lent](/wiki/The_Fight_Between_Carnival_and_Lent\n\"The Fight Between Carnival and Lent\")_ by [Pieter Bruegel the\nElder](/wiki/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder \"Pieter Bruegel the Elder\") (circa\n1558–1559).\n\nIn Spain, the bull of the Holy [Crusade](/wiki/Crusade \"Crusade\") (renewed\nperiodically after 1492) allowed the consumption of dairy products[70] and\neggs during Lent in exchange for a contribution to the cause of the crusade.\n\n[Giraldus Cambrensis](/wiki/Giraldus_Cambrensis \"Giraldus Cambrensis\"), in his\n_Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales_ , reports that \"in Germany and\nthe [arctic](/wiki/Arctic \"Arctic\") regions\", \"great and religious persons\"\neat the tail of [beavers](/wiki/Beaver \"Beaver\") as \"fish\" because of its\nsuperficial resemblance to \"both the taste and colour of fish\". The animal was\nvery abundant in Wales at the time.[71]\n\nIn current Western societies the practice is considerably relaxed, though in\nthe Eastern Orthodox, [Oriental Orthodox](/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox \"Oriental\nOrthodox\"), and [Eastern Catholic Churches](/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Church\n\"Eastern Catholic Church\"), abstinence from all animal products including\neggs, fish, fowl, and milk sourced from animals (e.g., cows and goats, as\nopposed to the milk of coconuts and soy beans) is still commonly practiced, so\nthat, where this is observed, only vegetarian (or [vegan](/wiki/Vegan\n\"Vegan\")) meals are consumed for the whole of Lent, 45 days in the [Byzantine\nRite](/wiki/Byzantine_Rite \"Byzantine Rite\").\n\nIn the [Western](/wiki/Latin_Church \"Latin Church\") Catholic Church, the\nobligation to fast no longer applies to all weekdays of Lent (40 days), but\nonly to Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. In the tradition of this part of the\nCatholic Church, abstinence from eating some form of food (generally meat, but\nnot dairy or fish products) is distinguished from fasting. Fasting involves\nhaving during the day only one proper meal with up to two \"collations\",[72]\nlight meatless meals sufficient to maintain strength but not adding up to the\nequivalent of a full meal.[73] In principle, abstinence is to be observed on\nAsh Wednesday and on every Friday of the year that is not a\n[solemnity](/wiki/Solemnity \"Solemnity\") (a liturgical feast day of the\nhighest rank); but in each country the [episcopal\nconference](/wiki/Episcopal_conference \"Episcopal conference\") can determine\nthe form it is to take, perhaps replacing abstinence with other forms of\npenance.[53][74][75]\n\nPresent canonical legislation on these matters follows the 1966 [Apostolic\nConstitution](/wiki/Apostolic_Constitution \"Apostolic Constitution\") of [Pope\nPaul VI](/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI \"Pope Paul VI\"), _[Paenitemini](/wiki/Paenitemini\n\"Paenitemini\")_ , in which he recommended that fasting be appropriate to the\nlocal economic situation and that all Catholics voluntarily fast and abstain.\nHe also allowed replacing fasting and abstinence with prayer and works of\ncharity in countries with a lower standard of living. The law of abstinence\nbinds those age 14 or over, and that of fast binds those who are at least 18\nyears of age and not yet 60.[53] The sick and those who have special needs are\nexcused, and dispensations can be granted by episcopal conferences or\nindividual bishops, which can be wider outside of Lent.
