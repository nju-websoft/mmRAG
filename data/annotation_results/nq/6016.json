She was initially pitched to CBS as only being\ncalled Number One in the series.[4][5][6] Burnham is a human who was raised\nfollowing [Vulcan](/wiki/Vulcan_\\(Star_Trek\\) \"Vulcan \\(Star Trek\\)\") culture\nand traditions by [Sarek](/wiki/Sarek \"Sarek\"),[4][7] and was not made a\nstarship captain, like the protagonists of previous _Star Trek_ series, \"to\nsee a character from a different perspective on the starship—one who has\ndifferent dynamic relationships with a captain, with subordinates, it gave us\nricher context\".[1] Fuller deliberately gave the character a traditionally\nmale name, which he had done with the female leads of his previous series.[8]\n\n  * [Doug Jones](/wiki/Doug_Jones_\\(actor\\) \"Doug Jones \\(actor\\)\") as Saru: \n\nA Science Officer serving as a Lieutenant Commander aboard the _Discovery_\n,[9] and the first Kelpien to enter Starfleet.

They have a reputation for\ncowardice.[10] Jones based Saru's walk on that of a supermodel,[7] out of\nnecessity thanks to the boots he had to wear to portray the character's hooved\nfeet forcing Jones to walk on the balls of his feet.[11] The producers\ncompared Saru to the characters Spock and [Data](/wiki/Data_\\(Star_Trek\\)\n\"Data \\(Star Trek\\)\") from previous series.[10]\n\n  * [Shazad Latif](/wiki/Shazad_Latif \"Shazad Latif\") as Ash Tyler: \n\nA Starfleet lieutenant and former [prisoner of war](/wiki/Prisoner_of_war\n\"Prisoner of war\"). Latif was originally cast in the role of Kol.[12][13]\nLatif noted that Tyler's [PTSD](/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder \"Post-\ntraumatic stress disorder\") would be explored in the show as he attempts to\nreturn to his Starfleet life, calling Tyler \"a very complex and painful and\ndeep character.\"[13] The character explores these issues with different\ncharacters, including Lorca due to their shared military background, and\nBurnham with whom \"there's a chemistry, a relationship\".[14]\n\n  * [Anthony Rapp](/wiki/Anthony_Rapp \"Anthony Rapp\") as Paul Stamets: \n\nA science officer specializing in astromycology (the study of fungi in\nspace).[9][15] The character is inspired by a real-life mycologist of [the\nsame name](/wiki/Paul_Stamets \"Paul Stamets\").[16] He is the first openly gay\ncharacter in a _Star Trek_ series, and the showrunners \"wanted to roll out\nthat character's sexuality the way people would roll out their sexuality in\nlife.\" Rapp noted that [Hikaru Sulu](/wiki/Hikaru_Sulu \"Hikaru Sulu\") was\nportrayed as gay in the film _[Star Trek Beyond](/wiki/Star_Trek_Beyond \"Star\nTrek Beyond\")_ , calling that \"a nice nod.

It is the first _Star Trek_ series since\n_[Star Trek: Enterprise](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise \"Star Trek: Enterprise\")_\nconcluded in 2005, and the first show to be developed specifically for the\n[CBS All Access](/wiki/CBS_All_Access \"CBS All Access\") on demand service.\n[Alex Kurtzman](/wiki/Alex_Kurtzman \"Alex Kurtzman\"), co-writer of the films\n_[Star Trek](/wiki/Star_Trek_\\(film\\) \"Star Trek \\(film\\)\")_ and _[Star Trek\nInto Darkness](/wiki/Star_Trek_Into_Darkness \"Star Trek Into Darkness\")_ , and\n[Heather Kadin](/wiki/Heather_Kadin \"Heather Kadin\") were set as executive\nproducers on the series, which is \"not related\" to the 2016 film _[Star Trek\nBeyond](/wiki/Star_Trek_Beyond \"Star Trek Beyond\")_.[28][29] The January 2017\ndate was the earliest that CBS could release a new _Star Trek_ series after an\nagreement the company made when it split with [Viacom](/wiki/Viacom \"Viacom\")\nin 2005.[30] [Showtime](/wiki/Showtime_\\(TV_network\\) \"Showtime \\(TV\nnetwork\\)\"), [Netflix](/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\"), and [Amazon\nVideo](/wiki/Amazon_Video \"Amazon Video\") all offered \"a lot of money\" for the\nrights to release the series,[31] but after heavily investing in the new All\nAccess service, CBS believed that a returning _Star Trek_ could be \"the\nfranchise that really puts All Access on the map\" and could earn more money in\nthe long run.[30][31]\n\nIn January 2016, CBS president Glenn Geller revealed that he and the CBS\nnetwork were not involved in the production of the series, saying, \"It really\nis for All Access. While the network will be broadcasting the pilot, I\nactually can't answer any creative questions about it.\"[32] The next month,\n[Bryan Fuller](/wiki/Bryan_Fuller \"Bryan Fuller\"), who began his career\nwriting for the series _[Star Trek: Deep Space\nNine](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\")_ and\n_[Star Trek: Voyager](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager \"Star Trek: Voyager\")_ , was\nannounced as the new series' [showrunner](/wiki/Showrunner \"Showrunner\") and\nco-creator alongside Kurtzman.[33][34] [Nicholas Meyer](/wiki/Nicholas_Meyer\n\"Nicholas Meyer\"), writer and director of _[Star Trek II: The Wrath of\nKhan](/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of\nKhan\")_ and _[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered\nCountry](/wiki/Star_Trek_VI:_The_Undiscovered_Country \"Star Trek VI: The\nUndiscovered Country\")_ , also joined the series as a writer and consulting\nproducer.[35] In March, [Rod Roddenberry](/wiki/Rod_Roddenberry \"Rod\nRoddenberry\"), the son of _Star Trek_ creator [Gene\nRoddenberry](/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry \"Gene Roddenberry\"), and Trevor Roth of\nRoddenberry Entertainment also joined the series, as executive producers.[36]\nFuller said that working with people previously involved with _Star Trek_ was\n\"really about making sure that we maintain authenticity\", and said that\nMeyer—who is widely considered to have made the best _Star Trek_ film in _The\nWrath of Khan_ —brings \"a clarity and a cleanliness to the storytelling. An\nability to ground science-fiction in a relatable way, and also making sure\nthat we're telling character stories.\"[37] Fuller had publicly called for\n_Star Trek_ to return to television for years, particularly because of its\nimpact on minority groups, as he explained, \"I couldn't stop thinking about\nhow many black people were inspired by seeing [Nichelle\nNichols](/wiki/Nichelle_Nichols \"Nichelle Nichols\") on the bridge of a ship. I\ncouldn't stop thinking about how many Asian people were inspired by seeing\n[George Takei](/wiki/George_Takei \"George Takei\") and feeling that gave them\nhope for their place in the future. I wanted to be part of that representation\nfor a new era.\"[38] When Fuller first met with CBS about the series, the\ncompany did not have a plan for what the new show would be.[39] He proposed an\n[anthology series](/wiki/Anthology_series \"Anthology series\") with each season\nbeing a standalone, serialized show set in a different era, beginning with a\nprequel to the original series, then stories set during the original series,\nduring _[Star Trek: The Next Generation](/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\n\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\")_ , and then \"beyond to a time in _Trek_\nthat's never been seen before\". Fuller compared this to what _[American Horror\nStory](/wiki/American_Horror_Story \"American Horror Story\")_ did for horror,\nand described the proposal as a platform for \"a universe of _Trek_ shows\".\nHowever, CBS told Fuller to just start with a single serialized show and see\nhow that performs first, and he began further developing the concept of a\nprequel to the original series.[38]\n\nFuller announced in June 2016 that the first season would consist of 13\nepisodes,[39] though he would prefer to produce 10 episodes a season moving\nforward.[6] A month later, Fuller announced the series' title to be _Star\nTrek: Discovery_ ,[40] and revealed that it would be set in the \"Prime\nTimeline\" (which includes the previous _Star Trek_ series, but not the modern\n[reboot films](/wiki/Star_Trek_\\(film_series\\)#2009_.22reboot.22 \"Star Trek\n\\(film series\\)\")) to keep the concurrent series and films separate, so \"we\ndon't have to track anything [happening in the films] and they don't have to\ntrack what we're doing\".[41][6] Also in July, [CBS Studios\nInternational](/wiki/CBS_Studios_International \"CBS Studios International\")\nlicensed the series to Netflix for release outside the United States and\nCanada,[34] a \"blockbuster\" deal that paid for the show's entire budget\n(around US$6–7 million per episode).[42][43] During pre-production on the\nseries, Fuller and CBS continued to disagree on the direction of the show,\nwhich was starting to overrun its per-episode budget, and was falling behind\nschedule due to Fuller supervising all aspects of the series as well as\nanother new show, _[American Gods](/wiki/American_Gods_\\(TV_series\\) \"American\nGods \\(TV series\\)\")_. This caused frustration among CBS executives who felt\nFuller should be focused on having _Discovery_ ready for release by the\nJanuary 2017 premiere date.[38] By August 2016, Fuller had hired Gretchen J.\nBerg and Aaron Harberts, who he had worked with on _[Pushing\nDaisies](/wiki/Pushing_Daisies \"Pushing Daisies\")_ , to serve as co-\nshowrunners with him.[6][43] A month later, he and Kurtzman asked CBS to delay\nthe series' release so they could meet the high expectations for it, and the\nstudio pushed the series premiere back to May 2017.\"[44] At the end of\nOctober, CBS asked Fuller to step down as showrunner,[38] and announced a\nrestructuring of the production: Berg and Harberts were made sole showrunners,\nworking from a broad story arc and overall mythology established by Fuller;\nKurtzman and Fuller would continue as executive producers, but with Fuller\nmoving his attention fully to _American Gods_ ; and [Akiva\nGoldsman](/wiki/Akiva_Goldsman \"Akiva Goldsman\") would join the series in a\nsupporting producer role, similar to the role he held on\n_[Fringe](/wiki/Fringe_\\(TV_series\\) \"Fringe \\(TV series\\)\")_ alongside\nKurtzman. CBS reiterated that they were \"extremely happy with [Fuller's]\ncreative direction\" for the series,[43] though some elements of the series\nthat came directly from Fuller were dropped, including some designs and \"more\nheavily allegorical and complex story\" points.[38] Fuller later confirmed that\nhe was no longer involved with the series, but expressed interest in returning\nfor future seasons.[45]\n\nWith production set to finally begin in January, \"a lot of careful\ndeliberation [was] continuing to go into making _Discovery_ special, from the\nchoice of directors, to set design, to the special effects.\"[46] [Ted\nSullivan](/wiki/Ted_Sullivan_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Ted Sullivan \\(filmmaker\\)\") also\njoined the series to serve as supervising writing producer.[47][48] At CBS's\n2017 upfront presentation, CBS Interactive president Marc DeBevoise confirmed\na \"fall\" release date for the series, and announced that the episode order for\nthe first season had been expanded to 15 episodes.[49][50] In June, CBS\nannounced a new premiere date of September 24, 2017, with the season airing\nthrough November 2017, and then beginning again in January 2018. This break\ngave more time to complete post-production on the second half of the\nseason.[24] Also that month, Kurtzman said that he and Fuller had discussed\nfuture seasons before the latter's departure, and promised that \"what's there\nin terms of story and certainly in terms of set-up, character, big ideas, the\nbig movement of the season, that's all stuff that Bryan and I talked about\"\nand would not be altered.[51] Goldsman said in August that the producers\nwanted \"a hybridized [anthology] approach. I don't think we're looking for an\nendless, continuing nine or 10 year story. We're looking at arcs which will\nhave characters that we know and characters that we don't know.\"[8] Kurtzman\nadded that the success of _Discovery_ could lead to other new _Star Trek_\nseries that could potentially use the anthology format.[52] By the end of\nAugust, Berg and Harberts had developed a \"road map\" for a second season, and\n\"the beginnings of one\" for a third. It was also revealed that an average\nepisode of the first season had ultimately cost US$8–8.5 million each, making\nit one of the most expensive television series ever and exceeding the original\nNetflix deal, though CBS still considered the series to be paid for already\ndue to the number of new All Access subscribers that the show was expected to\ndraw.[53] After the series' premiere, Kurtzman said that the producers wanted\nto avoid announcing release dates and having to delay those for any future\nseasons, due to the external pressure that caused with the first season, but\nthat he hoped a second season would be available in early 2019.[54] The second\nseason was officially ordered a month later in October 2017.[55]\n\n###\nWriting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Discovery&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Writing\")]\n\n\"The defining factor of Roddenberry's vision is the optimistic view of the\nfuture ... Once you lose that, you lose the essence of what _Star Trek_ is.\nThat being said… _Star Trek_ has always been a mirror to the time it reflected\nand [the topical question now] is how do you preserve and protect what\nStarfleet is in the weight of a challenge like war and the things that have to\nbe done in war.\"\n\n—Executive producer Alex Kurtzman on the balance between classic _Star Trek_\nand new elements in _Discovery_[56]\n\nThe series' writers are based in Los Angeles,[57] and include \"fans who all\nhave very different relationships to _Trek_ ,\" which Kurtzman said is \"a\nhealthy thing and it's a good thing\".[51] Fuller wanted to differentiate the\nseries from the previous 700+ episodes of _Star Trek_ by taking advantage of\nthe streaming format of All Access and telling a single story arc across the\nentire first season. He and Kurtzman developed this story from \"so many\nelements of _Star Trek_ \", taking certain episodes of the original series and\nusing their \"DNA\" to find \"the spirit of what _Star Trek_ offers, both in\nterms of high-concept science fiction storytelling and really wonderful\nmetaphors for the human condition\".[39] Berg said that the series' writers\n\"are so in love with\" _The Original Series_ , _The_ _Next Generation_ , and\nthe family aspect of those series, while Harberts added that Meyer's _Star\nTrek_ films were an especial influence on _Discovery_ because \"his\nstorytelling is complex and intellectual and yet there's a lot of room for\ncharacter voices\".[58]\n\nThe titular ship was named after _[Discovery One](/wiki/Discovery_One\n\"Discovery One\")_ from _[2001: A Space\nOdyssey](/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_\\(film\\) \"2001: A Space Odyssey\n\\(film\\)\")_ , [NASA](/wiki/NASA \"NASA\")'s [Space Shuttle\n_Discovery_](/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Discovery \"Space Shuttle Discovery\"), and\n\"the sense of discovery ... what [that] means to _Star Trek_ audiences who\nhave been promised a future by Gene Roddenberry where we come together as a\nplanet and seek new worlds and new alien races to explore and understand and\ncollaborate with\".[59] Fuller saw the series as a bridge between _Enterprise_\nand the original series—which are set around 150 years apart—but set much\ncloser to the latter to allow the series to \"play with all the iconography of\nthose ships and those uniforms\".[60] In May 2017, Sullivan described the\nseries as \"a genuine [prequel](/wiki/Prequel \"Prequel\")\" to the original\nseries,[61] with Goldsman later adding that there were many classic _Star\nTrek_ elements that fans among the writers wished to include in the series,\nbut couldn't because they were included in the original series as something\nbeing discovered by Starfleet for the first time then.[62] The choice to\nfeature a single serlialized story throughout the first season was inspired by\nthe general change in television to tell more realistic and serialized stories\nrather than the \"new destination-based adventure each week\" format mostly used\nin previous _Star Trek_ series. Fuller had been one of several writers during\nthe 1990s pushing for _Deep Space Nine_ and _Voyager_ to move towards this\nstyle.[63] Also inspired by modern, \"[peak\ntelevision](/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Television_\\(2000s%E2%80%93present\\) \"Golden\nAge of Television \\(2000s–present\\)\")\" series such as _Game of Thrones_ was a\nwillingness to kill off major characters for dramatic reasons, though the\nwriters wanted to avoid doing so gratuitously or for \"shock value\".[64]\n\nFuller said the series could \"push the content envelope since it won't be\nconstrained by broadcast standards\", but \"it's still _Star Trek_. It will\nprobably be slightly more graphic content ... I imagine we're going to shoot\nscenes a couple of ways and see what feels more authentic in the editing\nroom.\"[1] Harberts ultimately described the series as a \"hard PG-13\", saying\nthe series could include \"some violent things or [a] tiny bit of language\" but\nthey still wanted the show to be for families and to \"honor what the franchise\nis.\"[65] On using [time travel](/wiki/Time_travel \"Time travel\") in the\nseries, a plot device used in at least two episodes of every previous live-\naction _Star Trek_ season, Fuller said that it had not yet been used for any\nepisode by the end of August 2016, and, \"You never know when you want to pull\nout that device but I am not anticipating an over-reliance on time travel to\ntell this season's stories.\"[6] The series' writers also chose to ignore Gene\nRoddenberry's longstanding rule that Starfleet crew members not have any\nsignificant conflict with one another or be depicted negatively (a rule that\nRoddenberry himself did not always strictly follow). Harberts explained,\n\"We're trying to do stories that are complicated, with characters with strong\npoints of view and strong passions. People have to make mistakes—mistakes are\nstill going to be made in the future. We're still going to argue in the future\n... the thing we're taking from Roddenberry is how we solve those\nconflicts.\"[63] Because of the show's position as a prequel to the original\nseries, the producers felt it was more important for _Discovery_ to build\ntowards Roddenberry's ideals, and to show that \"you can't simply be accepting\nand tolerant without working for it, and so this show is about that\nstruggle.\"[62]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Discovery&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Sonequa_Martin-\nGreen_2017.jpg/170px-Sonequa_Martin-\nGreen_2017.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sonequa_Martin-Green_2017.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sonequa_Martin-Green_2017.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSonequa Martin-Green portrays the series' protagonist, Michael Burnham\n\nBy June 2016, Fuller had met with several actors, and said that \"we want to\ncarry on what _Star Trek_ does best, which is being progressive. So it's\nfascinating to look at all of these roles through a colorblind prism and a\ngender-blind prism\".[39] A month later, Kadin clarified that the series would\nfeature minority, female, and LGBTQ characters.[66] In August, Fuller said the\nseries would feature \"about seven\" lead characters,[67] and would star a\nlieutenant commander, rather than a starship captain like previous _Star Trek_\nseries, to be played by a non-white actress. He said the series would also\ninclude more alien characters than other _Star Trek_ series, and would feature\nat least one openly gay character. Fuller, who is gay himself, had been\ndetermined to see this happen since receiving hate mail while working on\n_Voyager_ when a character on that show was rumored to be coming out as\ngay.[1] By this time, Fuller had discussed the series' casting with [Mae\nJemison](/wiki/Mae_Jemison \"Mae Jemison\"), the first black woman in space (who\nmade a cameo appearance in an episode of _The Next Generation_).[1][68]\n\nFuller anticipated casting announcements in October 2016,[6] but none had been\nmade by the end of that month. The majority of the series main characters were\nbelieved to have been cast by then, but no actress had been cast for the\nseries' lead role. This was a source of \"some internal stress\" at CBS.[43]\nSeveral African American and Latina actresses were being looked at for the\nrole, with CBS \"not seeking a huge star and [preferring] a fresh face for the\npart.\"[69] In October, the cast was believed to include \"a female admiral, a\nmale [Klingon](/wiki/Klingon \"Klingon\") captain, a male admiral, a male\nadviser and a British male doctor\", with one of those male leads played by an\nopenly gay actor.[70] The next month, [Doug Jones](/wiki/Doug_Jones_\\(actor\\)\n\"Doug Jones \\(actor\\)\") and [Anthony Rapp](/wiki/Anthony_Rapp \"Anthony Rapp\")\nwere revealed to be cast, as Science Officers Saru and Stamets,\nrespectively.[9] The former is a Kelpien, an alien race created for the\nseries,[10] while the latter is the first _Star Trek_ character to be\nconceived and announced as gay.[9] [Sonequa Martin-\nGreen](/wiki/Sonequa_Martin-Green \"Sonequa Martin-Green\") was cast in the lead\nrole in December,[71] which was officially confirmed in April 2017, with the\ncharacter's name revealed to be Michael Burnham.[5] Also in December, [Shazad\nLatif](/wiki/Shazad_Latif \"Shazad Latif\") was cast as the Klingon Kol.[72] In\nMarch 2017, [Jason Isaacs](/wiki/Jason_Isaacs \"Jason Isaacs\") was cast as\nCaptain Lorca of the USS _Discovery_ ,[21] and [Mary\nWiseman](/wiki/Mary_Wiseman_\\(actress\\) \"Mary Wiseman \\(actress\\)\") joined as\nTilly, a cadet.[18] At the end of April, Latif was revealed to have been\nrecast to the role of Starfleet Lieutenant Tyler.[12]\n\n###\nDesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Discovery&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\nMark Worthington and Todd Cherniawsky served as initial production designers\nfor the series;[73] Gersha Phillips and [Suttirat Anne\nLarlarb](/wiki/Suttirat_Anne_Larlarb \"Suttirat Anne Larlarb\") designed the\ncostumes;[3][74] veteran _Star Trek_ designer [John Eaves](/wiki/John_Eaves\n\"John Eaves\") designed starships, along with Scott Schneider;[75][76] and\n[Glenn Hetrick](/wiki/Glenn_Hetrick \"Glenn Hetrick\") and Neville Page of\nAlchemy Studios provided prosthetics, props, and armor.[3][77] Page previously\nserved as the concept and creature designer on the three \"Kelvin Timeline\"\n_Star Trek_ films.[78] The series also employed seven art directors, over nine\nillustrators, more than thirty-five set designers, and over four hundred and\nfifty painters, carpenters, sculptors, model makers, welders, set dressers,\nand prop builders.[76]\n\nFuller said on the general approach to design on the show, \"we're producing\nthe show in 2016. We have to update the style of the effects, the style of the\nsets, the style of the makeup ... all of the other series have been produced\n[at a time that] isn't as sophisticated as we are now with what we can do\nproduction-wise, we're going to be reestablishing an entire look for the\nseries\" and for _Star Trek_ moving forward.[1] Fuller had wanted the series'\nuniforms to reflect the primary colors of the original series, but this was\ndiscarded after his departure.[38] However, Fuller's designs for the Klingons,\nwhich he \"really, really wanted\" to redesign, were retained.[8][2] [3D\nSystems](/wiki/3D_Systems \"3D Systems\")' \"cutting edge\" 3D printing techniques\nwere widely used in the making of the series.[3][78] For the prosthetics, Page\nand Hetrick took detailed laser scans of the actors so they could simulate\nmake-up and prosthetics in a virtual environment before creating the practical\nversion.[79] Fabric for the Starfleet uniforms seen in the series were custom-\ndyed in [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland \"Switzerland\"); the costumes were cut\nand assembled in Toronto by Phillips and her department. The main uniforms\nseen in the series are a navy blue specifically mixed for the show, with gold\nor silver embellishments depending on the division of the officer. Medical\nofficers wear a \"hospital white\" variant, also custom-dyed in Switzerland,\nwhile the captain's uniform is the standard navy blue but with additional gold\npiping on the shoulders.[80] Starfleet insignia badges were molded from\nsilicon bronze, and then polished and plated by a jeweler to create custom\ncolors for the series, based on the division of the officer wearing the\nuniform: gold for command, silver for sciences and medical, and copper for\noperations. Props such as [tricorders](/wiki/Tricorder \"Tricorder\") and hand\nscanners, communicators, and phasers were produced with 3D printing and\nheavily inspired by their designs in the original _Star Trek_ series.[80]\n\nThe design of the USS _Discovery_ is based on an unused [Ralph\nMcQuarrie](/wiki/Ralph_McQuarrie \"Ralph McQuarrie\") design for the [USS\n_Enterprise_](/wiki/Starship_Enterprise \"Starship Enterprise\") from the\nunproduced film _[Star Trek: Planet of the\nTitans](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Planet_of_the_Titans \"Star Trek: Planet of the\nTitans\")_ , which Fuller had noted in July 2016 was \"to a point that we can't\nlegally comment on it until [our legal team] figures out some things\".[41]\nMcQuarrie's designs were based on the concepts created by [Ken\nAdam](/wiki/Ken_Adam \"Ken Adam\") to feature a vessel with a flattened\nsecondary hull.[81][82] Fuller wanted \"something distinct about what our _Star\nTrek_ was going to look\" like, and after seeing McQuarrie's design \"saw sort\nof harder lines of a ship and started talking about race cars and Lamborghinis\nin the '70s and _James Bond_ cars and started working on the designs, taking\nthose inspirations and coming up with something completely unique to us.\"[83]\nThe design for the _Discovery_ went through several revisions and refinements\nbefore the final version was approved in December 2016.[84] The sickbay on the\n_Discovery_ was inspired by that of the _Enterprise_ from the original\nseries.[85] Other Federation starships created for the show include the USS\n_Shenzhou_ and the USS _Europa_.[86][87] Sets for the _Discovery_ 's interiors\nwere described as a \"tangle of corridors and rooms\",[53] and were designed to\nmatch with the exterior design of the ship, so \"the rooms [could believably]\nfit inside the house\", but there was some artistic license taken in places.\nThe graphics used for the Starfleet computer systems were designed to be\nbelievably more advanced than modern technology, but to also \"honor the look\nand feel\" of the designs used in previous series. The initial colors allowed\nfor the graphics were mostly restricted to blues, with the intention of these\nbecoming more colorful the closer the series gets to the time period of the\noriginal series.[76]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Discovery&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\n_Star Trek: Discovery_ is filmed at [Pinewood Toronto\nStudios](/wiki/Pinewood_Toronto_Studios \"Pinewood Toronto Studios\"),[88] with\n[Vincenzo Natali](/wiki/Vincenzo_Natali \"Vincenzo Natali\") serving as\nproducing director for the series.[39] Some of the series' sets took over six\nweeks to create,[86] and new sets were being built up until the end of\nproduction of the season.[89] _Discovery_ took advantage of multiple\nsoundstages at the studio, including the largest soundstage in North\nAmerica.[53] Some episodes for the show were filmed solely on existing sets,\nmaking them [bottle episodes](/wiki/Bottle_episode \"Bottle episode\"), though\nHarberts said the series would not do anything \"as bottle-y as 'everyone is\nstuck in the mess hall!'\"[89]\n\nFor the visual scope of the series, Kurtzman felt that the show had to\n\"justify being on a premium cable service\".[90] The showrunners were\nparticularly inspired by _[Star Trek: The Motion\nPicture](/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\")_\nand its \"wider scope\", with Harberts explaining that the series is shot in a\n[2:1 aspect ratio](/wiki/Aspect_ratio_\\(image\\) \"Aspect ratio \\(image\\)\")\nwhich \"just lends itself to a very lyrical way of telling the story.\" He added\nthat some of the series' visuals were influenced by the modern _Star Trek_\nfilms from [J. J. Abrams](/wiki/J._J._Abrams \"J. J. Abrams\").[58] Some of\nthese influences, per Goldsman, are \"the ability to be creative\ncinematically…the intimate discourse, the humanistic storytelling with the\ngiant canvas that is Star Trek. A more kinetic camera, a more dynamic way of\nexisting, a much greater use of practical sets so when you’re running down a\ncorridor, you’re running down a corridor. A sense of rhythm…there is a sense\nof litheness, a kind of fluidity in the characterizations.\"[91] The producers\nworked closely with pilot director [David Semel](/wiki/David_Semel \"David\nSemel\") to make the series look as cinematic as possible, including filming\nthe bridge of Starfleet's ships in such a way as \"not to shoot in a sort of\n[proscenium](/wiki/Proscenium \"Proscenium\") box…to be able to get the camera\ninto spaces where, you know, to shoot it in interesting ways, which is a\ncombination of choreographing a scene to motivate the camera moving, and also\nlighting.\"[56] The cinematographers for the series wanted to emphasize on set\nsourcing, with lighting built in wherever it would naturally appear to help\ncreate a more realistic feel, and distance the series from the \"stage\" feel of\nthe original series.[89] The lighting could also be controlled to create\ncompletely different situations, such as the lighting of a Starfleet red\nalert.[76] Harberts said that the cinematographers wanted the series to have a\n\"[Rembrandt](/wiki/Rembrandt \"Rembrandt\") texture\".[89]\n\n### Visual\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Discovery&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Visual effects\")]\n\nVisual effects producers were hired to begin work on the series during the\ninitial writing period, with Fuller explaining that the series would require\nsuch things as \"digital augmentation on certain alien species\" and \"the\ntransporter beams\".

Fuller\nhad asked for a book to be written based on that premise, and Mack had worked\nwith the _Discovery_ writers to stay \"in the loop throughout the season with\nall the scripts and the story development. There were a few false starts, but\neventually it allowed us to collaboratively create this story\". Mack hinted\nthat the [USS _Enterprise_](/wiki/USS_Enterprise_\\(NCC-1701\\) \"USS Enterprise\n\\(NCC-1701\\)\") could also appear in the novel. The second _Discovery_ novel is\nbeing written by [Dayton Ward](/wiki/Dayton_Ward \"Dayton Ward\"), is set 10\nyears before the show, and is intended to be released in early 2018.[113]\n\n####\nComics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Discovery&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Comics\")]\n\nIn July 2017, IDW announced the first tie-in comic series, also titled _Star\nTrek: Discovery_ , to be written by Johnson and Beyer with art by Tony\nShasteen, who previously worked with Johnson on the comic _Star Trek: Boldly\nGo_. IDW described the comic as \"Klingon-centric\", and set the first issue for\nrelease on October 25.[114] Johnson compared working with Beyer on the comic\nto his work on the _Star Trek: Countdown_ comic, a tie-in to the [2009 _Star\nTrek_ film](/wiki/Star_Trek_\\(film\\) \"Star Trek \\(film\\)\") that he wrote with\nKurtzman and [Roberto Orci](/wiki/Roberto_Orci \"Roberto Orci\"), saying that\nher position as a staff writer on the _Discovery_ show \"means we have all the\ninside access that we need. So the story in the comic will really matter and\nnot just feel like a one-off. It is actually able to expand the story you guys\nare going to see in the show itself.\"[115]\n\nIn August, it was clarified that the first comic would be a four-issue\nminiseries focused on T'Kuvma and his followers, and that IDW intended to\ncreate a series of comic miniseries based on different aspects of the series\nto create \"targeted stories on some different subjects\". Johnson stated that\nthey were \"building out the characters in the Klingon world with these comics,\nand we can't wait to show you.\" He added that discussions were being held\nregarding the subject of the next miniseries. IDW editor Sarah Gaydos said,\n\"The access we're getting to the show to create these comics that are integral\nto fleshing out the backstories of the characters is unheard of, and I do a\nlot of licensed comics.\"[113]\n\n### _Star Trek\nTimelines_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Discovery&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Star Trek Timelines\")]\n\nIn late 2017, \"hours\" of _Discovery_ -based content will be added to the role\nplaying video game _[Star Trek Timelines](/wiki/Star_Trek_Timelines \"Star Trek\nTimelines\")_ , including Michael Burnham and Saru as new crew members for the\ngame and new ships from the show, both Federation and otherwise. A month long\n\"Mega-Event\" based on the series will also take place.[116]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Trek:_Discovery&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ Hibberd, James (August 10, 2016).
