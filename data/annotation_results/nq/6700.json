The 12-hour clock was developed over time from the mid-\nsecond millennium [BC](/wiki/Anno_Domini \"Anno Domini\") to the 16th century\n[AD](/wiki/Anno_Domini \"Anno Domini\").\n\nThe 12-hour time convention is common in several English-speaking nations and\nformer British colonies, as well as a few other countries.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History and use\n    * 1.1 Use by country\n    * 1.2 Computer support\n  * 2 Abbreviations\n  * 3 Related conventions\n    * 3.1 Typography\n      * 3.1.1 Encoding\n    * 3.2 Informal speech and rounding off\n    * 3.3 Formal speech and times to the minute\n  * 4 Confusion at noon and midnight\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## History and\nuse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History and use\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Exeter_Cathedral_astronomical_clock.jpg/170px-\nExeter_Cathedral_astronomical_clock.jpg)](/wiki/File:Exeter_Cathedral_astronomical_clock.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Exeter_Cathedral_astronomical_clock.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Exeter Cathedral Astronomical\nClock](/wiki/Exeter_Cathedral_Astronomical_Clock \"Exeter Cathedral\nAstronomical Clock\"), showing the double-XII numbering scheme\n\nThe natural day-and-night division of a calendar day forms the fundamental\nbasis as to why each day is split into two cycles. Originally there were two\ncycles; one cycle which could be tracked by the position of the Sun (day)\nfollowed by one cycle which could be tracked by the Moon and stars (night).\nThis would eventually evolve into the two 12-hour periods that started at\nmidnight (a.m.) and noon (p.m.) which are used today. Noon itself is rarely\nabbreviated today, but if it is, it is denoted M.[1]\n\nThe 12-hour clock can be traced back as far as [Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia\n\"Mesopotamia\") and [Ancient Egypt](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt \"Ancient Egypt\").[4]\nBoth an Egyptian [sundial](/wiki/Sundial \"Sundial\") for daytime use[5] and an\nEgyptian [water clock](/wiki/Water_clock \"Water clock\") for night-time use\nwere found in the tomb of Pharaoh [Amenhotep I](/wiki/Amenhotep_I \"Amenhotep\nI\").[6] Dating to c. 1500 BC, these clocks divided their respective times of\nuse into 12 hours each.\n\nThe [Romans](/wiki/Ancient_Rome \"Ancient Rome\") also used a 12-hour clock:\ndaylight was divided into 12 equal hours (thus hours having varying length\nthroughout the year) and the night was divided into four watches.\n\nThe first mechanical clocks in the 14th century, if they had dials at all,\nshowed all 24 hours, used the [24-hour analog dial](/wiki/24-hour_analog_dial\n\"24-hour analog dial\"), influenced by astronomers' familiarity with the\n[astrolabe](/wiki/Astrolabe \"Astrolabe\") and sundial, and their desire to\nmodel the [Earth's apparent motion around the Sun](/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation\n\"Earth's rotation\"). In [Northern Europe](/wiki/Northern_Europe \"Northern\nEurope\") these dials generally used the 12-hour [numbering\nscheme](/wiki/Numbering_scheme \"Numbering scheme\") in [Roman\nnumerals](/wiki/Roman_numerals \"Roman numerals\"), but showed both _a.m._ and\n_p.m._ periods in sequence. This is known as the double-XII system, and can be\nseen on many surviving clock faces, such as those at\n[Wells](/wiki/Wells_Cathedral_clock \"Wells Cathedral clock\") and\n[Exeter](/wiki/Exeter_Cathedral#Clock \"Exeter Cathedral\").\n\nElsewhere in Europe, particularly in [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\"), numbering\nwas more likely to be based on the 24-hour system (I to XXIV), reflecting the\nItalian style of counting the hours. The 12-hour clock was used throughout the\nBritish empire.\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, the 12-hour analog dial and time system\ngradually became established as standard throughout Northern Europe for\ngeneral public use. The 24-hour analog dial was reserved for more specialized\napplications, such as [astronomical clocks](/wiki/Astronomical_clock\n\"Astronomical clock\") and chronometers.\n\nMost analog clocks and watches today use the 12-hour dial, on which the\nshorter hour hand rotates once every 12 hours and twice in one day. Some\nanalog clock dials have an inner ring of numbers along with the standard\n1-to-12 numbered ring. The number 12 is paired either with a 00 or a 24, while\nthe numbers 1 through 11 are paired with the numbers 13 through 23,\nrespectively. This modification allows the clock to be read also in the\n[24-hour notation](/wiki/24-hour_notation \"24-hour notation\"). This kind of\n12-hour clock can be found in countries where the 24-hour clock is preferred.\n\n### Use by\ncountry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Use by country\")]\n\nMain article: [Date and time representation by\ncountry](/wiki/Date_and_time_representation_by_country \"Date and time\nrepresentation by country\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Westclox_Big_Ben.jpg/170px-\nWestclox_Big_Ben.jpg)](/wiki/File:Westclox_Big_Ben.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Westclox_Big_Ben.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA typical [analog 12-hour clock](/wiki/Clock#Analog_clocks \"Clock\")\n\nIn several countries the 12-hour clock is the dominant written and spoken\nsystem of time, predominantly in nations that were part of the former British\nEmpire (the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"), the\n[United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"),\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"), [India](/wiki/India \"India\"),\n[Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan \"Pakistan\"), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia \"Malaysia\"),\n[Bangladesh](/wiki/Bangladesh \"Bangladesh\") etc.), though a few others\n([Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\"), [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt \"Egypt\"), and the former\nAmerican colony of the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\")) follow\nthis convention as well. In most countries, however, the [24-hour\nclock](/wiki/24-hour_clock \"24-hour clock\") is the standard system used,\nespecially in writing. Some nations use a combination of the two, preferring\nthe 12-hour system in colloquial speech but using the 24-hour system in\nwritten form and in formal contexts. This is true in some European nations and\nLatin America.\n\nThe 12-hour clock in speech often uses phrases such as _in the morning, in the\nafternoon, in the evening,_ and _at night_. Outside of English-speaking\ncountries, the terms _a.m._ and _p.m._ are seldom used and often unknown. In\nEngland, the descriptive phrases were universal until relatively recently;\ne.g., _Rider 's British Merlin_ almanac for 1795 (published in London)[7] uses\nthem, and so does a similar almanac for 1773.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Digital-clock-\nalarm.jpg/220px-Digital-clock-alarm.jpg)](/wiki/File:Digital-clock-alarm.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Digital-clock-alarm.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA typical [digital](/wiki/Digital_clock \"Digital clock\") 12-hour alarm clock\nindicating _p.m._ with a dot to the left of the hour\n\n### Computer\nsupport[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Computer support\")]\n\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation.\nMost operating systems, including [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\n\"Microsoft Windows\") and [Unix-like](/wiki/Unix-like \"Unix-like\") systems such\nas [Linux](/wiki/Linux \"Linux\") and [macOS](/wiki/MacOS \"MacOS\"), activate the\n12-hour notation by default for a limited number of language and region\nsettings.\n\nThis behavior can be changed by the user, such as with the\n[Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\") operating system\n\"Region and Language\" settings.[8]\n\n## Abbreviations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Abbreviations\")]\n\nThe [Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") abbreviations _a.m._ and _p.m._ (often\nwritten \"am\" and \"pm\", \"AM\" and \"PM\", or \"A.M.\" and \"P.M.\") are used in\n[English](/wiki/English_language \"English language\") and\n[Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_language \"Spanish language\").[9] The equivalents in\n[Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\") are π.µ. and _µ.µ._ ,\nrespectively, and in [Sinhala](/wiki/Sinhala_language \"Sinhala language\")\nපෙ.ව.

(__pa.va.__) for පස්වරු (__pasvaru__ , පස්සේ __passē__ \\- after, post).\nHowever, noon is rarely abbreviated in any of these languages, noon normally\nbeing written in full. In Portuguese, there are two official options and many\nother used, for example, using 21:45 pm: 21h45 or 21h45min (official ones) or\n21:45 or 9:45 p.m.\n\nMost other languages lack formal abbreviations for \"before noon\" and \"after\nnoon\", and their users use the 12-hour clock only orally and\ninformally.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] However, in many languages, such as Russian and\nHebrew, informal designations are used, such as \"9 in the morning\" or \"3 in\nthe night\".\n\nWhen abbreviations and phrases are omitted, one may rely on sentence context\nand societal norms to reduce ambiguity. For example, if one commutes to work\nat \"9:00\", 9:00 a.m. may be implied, but if a [social\ndance](/wiki/Social_dance \"Social dance\") is scheduled to begin at \"9:00\", it\nmay begin at 9:00 p.m.\n\n## Related\nconventions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Related conventions\")]\n\n### Typography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Typography\")]\n\nThe terms \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\" are abbreviations of the Latin _ante meridiem_\n(before midday) and _post meridiem_ (after midday). Depending on the [style\nguide](/wiki/Style_guide \"Style guide\") referenced, the abbreviations \"a.m.\"\nand \"p.m.\" are variously written in [small capitals](/wiki/Small_capital\n\"Small capital\") (\"am\" and \"pm\"), [uppercase](/wiki/Uppercase \"Uppercase\")\nletters without a [period](/wiki/Period_\\(punctuation\\) \"Period\n\\(punctuation\\)\") (\"AM\" and \"PM\"), uppercase letters with\n[periods](/wiki/Periods. \"Periods.\"), or [lowercase](/wiki/Lowercase\n\"Lowercase\") letters (\"am\" and \"pm\" or, more commonly, \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\").\n\nSome stylebooks suggest the use of a space between the number and the a.m. or\np.m. abbreviation.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Style guides recommend not using a.m. and p.m.\nwithout a time preceding it,[10] although doing so can be advantageous when\ndescribing an event that always happens before or after noon.\n\nThe hour/minute separator [varies between\ncountries](/wiki/Date_and_time_representation_by_country \"Date and time\nrepresentation by country\"): some use a colon, others use a\n[period](/wiki/Period_\\(punctuation\\) \"Period \\(punctuation\\)\") (full stop),\nand still others use the letter h. In many instances using the 24-hour clock,\nthere is no separator between hours and minutes (0800, read as written, i.e.\n\"oh-eight-hundred\").\n\n#### Encoding[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Encoding\")]\n\nIn Unicode, there exist symbols for:\n\n    \"a.m.\" [U+](/wiki/Unicode \"Unicode\")33C2 ㏂ (HTML `&#13250;`) and\n    \"p.m.\" [U+](/wiki/Unicode \"Unicode\")33D8 ㏘ (HTML `&#13272;`).\n\nThey are meant to be used only with [Chinese-Japanese-\nKorean](/wiki/CJK_characters \"CJK characters\") character sets, as they take up\nexactly the same space as one [Chinese character](/wiki/Chinese_character\n\"Chinese character\").\n\n### Informal speech and rounding\noff[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Informal speech and rounding off\")]\n\nIt is common to round a time to the nearest five minutes and express the time\nas so many minutes past an hour (5:05 is \"five past five\" or \"five oh five\",\nformerly written as 5.5 in some publications in the UK[11]) or minutes to an\nhour (e.g., 5:55 is \"five to six\"). A period of 15 minutes is often expressed\nas \"a quarter\" (hence 5:15 is \"a quarter past five\") and 30 minutes is\nexpressed as \"half\" (hence 5:30 is \"half past five\" or merely \"half five\").\nThus, the time would be spoken as 8:45, and \"_(a) quarter to_ _nine_ \".[12]\nMoreover, in situations where the relevant hour is obvious or has been\nrecently mentioned, speakers can use terms \"quarter to\" and \"half past\" to\navoid elaborate sentences in particularly informal conversations. These forms\nare often commonly used in television and radio broadcasts that cover multiple\ntime zones at one-hour intervals.\n\nInstead of meaning 5:30, the \"half five\" expression is sometimes used to mean\n4:30, or \"half-way to five\", especially for regions such as the [American\nMidwest](/wiki/Midwestern_United_States \"Midwestern United States\") and other\nareas that have been particularly [influenced by German\nculture](/wiki/German_America \"German America\"). This meaning follows the\npattern choices of many Germanic and [Slavic languages](/wiki/Slavic_languages\n\"Slavic languages\"), including [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_language \"Dutch language\"),\n[Danish](/wiki/Danish_language \"Danish language\"),\n[Finnish](/wiki/Finnish_language \"Finnish language\"),\n[Hungarian](/wiki/Hungarian_language \"Hungarian language\"),\n[Russian](/wiki/Russian_language \"Russian language\") and\n[Swedish](/wiki/Swedish_language \"Swedish language\").\n\n### Formal speech and times to the\nminute[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Formal speech and times to the minute\")]\n\n\"O'clock\" redirects here. For the o'clock watch, see [O bag](/wiki/O_bag \"O\nbag\").\n\nMinutes may be expressed as an exact number of minutes past the hour\nspecifying the time of day (e.g., 6:32 p.m. is \"six thirty-two\").\nAdditionally, when expressing the time using the \"past (after)\" or \"to\n(before)\" formula, it is conventional to choose the number of minutes below 30\n(e.g., 6.32 pm is conventionally \"twenty-eight minutes to seven\" rather than\n\"thirty-two minutes past six\").\n\nIn spoken English, full hours are often represented by the numbered hour\nfollowed by _o 'clock_ (10:00 as _ten o 'clock_, 2:00 as _two o 'clock_). This\nmay be followed by the \"a.m.\" or \"p.m.\" designator, though phrases such as _in\nthe morning, in the afternoon, in the evening,_ or _at night_ more commonly\nfollow analog-style terms such as _o 'clock, half past three,_ and _quarter to\nfour. O 'clock_ itself may be omitted, telling a time as _four a.m._ or _four\np.m._ Minutes \":01\" to \":09\" are usually pronounced as _oh one_ to _oh nine_\n(_nought_ or _zero_ can also be used instead of _oh_). Minutes \":10\" to \":59\"\nare pronounced as their usual number-words. For instance, 6:02 a.m. can be\npronounced _six oh two a.m._ whereas 6:32 a.m. could be told as _six thirty-\ntwo a.m._\n\n## Confusion at noon and\nmidnight[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Confusion at noon and midnight\")]\n\nTime according to various conventions  Device or [style](/wiki/Style_guide \"Style guide\") | [Midnight](/wiki/Midnight \"Midnight\")  \nStart of day | [Noon](/wiki/Noon \"Noon\") | Midnight  \nEnd of day  \n---|---|---|---  \nWritten 24-hour time,  \n[ISO 8601](/wiki/ISO_8601 \"ISO 8601\") | 00:00 | 12:00 | 24:00   \nU.S. Government Printing Office (1953)[13] | midnight[a] | noon  \n12 o'clock noon  \n12 m. | midnight  \n12:00 p.m.  \nU.S. Government Printing Office (2000)[14] |    \nmidnight[a] | 12 a.m.  \nnoon | 12 p.m.  \nmidnight[a]  \nU.S. Government Printing Office (2008)[15] | 12 a.m.  \n12 midnight[a] | 12 p.m.  \n12 noon |    \n12 midnight[a]  \nJapanese legal convention[_[dubious](/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement \"Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute\") – [discuss](/wiki/Talk:12-hour_clock#Dubious \"Talk:12-hour clock\")_][16] | 0:00 a.m. | 12:00 a.m. | 12:00 p.m.   \nChicago Manual of Style[17] |  | noon  \n12:00 m. |   \n[Canadian Press](/wiki/Canadian_Press \"Canadian Press\"),[18] UK standard[19] | Midnight | Noon | Midnight   \nAssociated Press style[20] | — | noon | midnight   \n[NIST](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology \"National Institute of Standards and Technology\")[21] | midnight[b]  \n12:01 a.m. | noon | midnight[b]  \n11:59 p.m.  \n  \n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ These styles are ambiguous with respect to whether midnight is at the start or end of each day.\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ NIST recommends using 11:59 p.m. and 12:01 a.m. to disambiguate when needed.\n\n  \n  \nIt is not always clear what times \"12:00 a.m.\" and \"12:00 p.m.\" denote. From\nthe [Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") words _meridies_ (midday), _ante_ (before)\nand _post_ (after), the term _ante meridiem_ (a.m.) means before midday and\n_post meridiem_ (p.m.) means after midday. Since \"noon\" (midday - _meridies_\n(m.)) is neither before nor after itself, the terms a.m. and p.m. do not\napply.[21] Although \"12 m.\" was suggested as a way to indicate noon, this is\nseldom done[17] and also does not resolve the question of how to indicate\nmidnight.\n\n_[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English\nLanguage](/wiki/The_American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language \"The\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\")_ states \"By convention,\n_12 AM_ denotes midnight and _12 PM_ denotes noon. Because of the potential\nfor confusion, it is advisable to use _12 noon_ and _12 midnight_.\"[22]\n\nE. G. Richards in his book _Mapping Time_ provided a diagram in which 12 a.m.\nmeans noon and 12 p.m. means midnight.[23] The style manual of the [United\nStates Government Printing\nOffice](/wiki/United_States_Government_Printing_Office \"United States\nGovernment Printing Office\") used 12 a.m. for noon and 12 p.m. for midnight\nuntil its 2008 edition, when it reversed these designations,[14][15] later\nmaintained in its 2016 revision.[24]\n\nMany U.S. style guides, and\n[NIST](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology \"National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology\")'s \"Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\"\nweb page,[21] recommend that it is clearest if one refers to \"noon\" or \"12:00\nnoon\" and \"midnight\" or \"12:00 midnight\" (rather than to \"12:00 p.m.\" and\n\"12:00 a.m.\"). The NIST website states that \"12 a.m. and 12 p.m. are ambiguous\nand should not be used.\"\n\n_The Associated Press Stylebook_ specifies that midnight \"is part of the day\nthat is ending, not the one that is beginning.\"[20] Thus, according to AP\nstyle, \"midnight Friday\" occurs one minute after 11:59 p.m. Friday, not one\nminute before 12:01 a.m. Friday.\n\n_The Canadian Press Stylebook_[18] says, \"write _noon_ or _midnight_ , not _12\nnoon_ or _12 midnight_.\" Phrases such as \"12 a.m.\" and \"12 p.m.\" are not\nmentioned at all. Britain's National Physical Laboratory \"FAQ-Time\" web\npage[19] states \"In cases where the context cannot be relied upon to place a\nparticular event, the pair of days straddling midnight can be quoted\"; also\n\"the terms 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. should be avoided.\"\n\nLikewise, some U.S. style guides recommend either clarifying \"midnight\" with\nother context clues, such as specifying the two dates between which it falls,\nor not referring to midnight at all. For an example of the latter method,\n\"midnight\" is replaced with \"11:59 p.m.\" for the end of a day or \"12:01 a.m.\"\nfor the start of a day. That has become common in the United States in legal\ncontracts and for [airplane](/wiki/Airplane \"Airplane\"), [bus](/wiki/Bus\n\"Bus\"), or [train](/wiki/Train \"Train\") schedules, though some schedules use\nother conventions. Occasionally, when trains run at regular intervals, the\npattern may be broken at midnight by displacing the midnight departure one or\nmore minutes, such as to 11:59 p.m. or 12:01 a.m.[25]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [24-hour clock](/wiki/24-hour_clock \"24-hour clock\")\n  * [30-hour clock](/wiki/30-hour_clock \"30-hour clock\")\n  * [6-hour clock](/wiki/6-hour_clock \"6-hour clock\")\n  * [Clock position](/wiki/Clock_position \"Clock position\")\n  * [Date and time representation by country](/wiki/Date_and_time_representation_by_country \"Date and time representation by country\")\n  * [Decimal time](/wiki/Decimal_time \"Decimal time\")\n  * [Midnight](/wiki/Midnight \"Midnight\")\n  * [Noon](/wiki/Noon \"Noon\")\n  * [Pahar](/wiki/Pahar \"Pahar\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=12-hour_clock&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ \"Time\". _The New Encyclopædia Britannica_. **28**. 1986. pp. 660 2a.   \n[\"Time\"](http://library.eb.com.au/eb/article-61027). _Encyclopædia Britannica.\nEncyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition_.
