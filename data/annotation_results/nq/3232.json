This list spans the period\nfrom the issue dated January 1, 1955 to present. The _Billboard_ Hot 100 began\nwith the issue dated August 4, 1958, and is currently the standard popular\nmusic chart in the [United States](/wiki/United_States_of_America \"United\nStates of America\").\n\n[Prior to the creation of the Hot 100](/wiki/Best_Sellers_In_Stores \"Best\nSellers In Stores\"), _Billboard_ published four singles charts: \"Best Sellers\nin Stores\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\", \"Most Played in Jukeboxes\" and \"The Top\n100\". These charts, which ranged from 20 to 100 slots, were phased out at\ndifferent times between 1957 and 1958. Though technically not part of the Hot\n100 chart history, their data are included for computational purposes, and to\navoid unenlightening or misleading characterizations.

Kelly](/wiki/R._Kelly \"R. Kelly\") and [Céline Dion](/wiki/Celine_Dion \"Celine Dion\") (December 5, 1998). Though the song was making its first appearance on the Hot 100 that week, _Billboard_ did not consider it a debut at #1, since it appeared on unpublished test charts prior to the allowance of airplay-only songs on the main chart.[151] \"I'm Your Angel\" also entered the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart that week at #1,[152] so it would have been ineligible to chart on the Hot 100 before then.\n  * The first \"airplay-only\" song to reach #1 (no points from a commercial single release) was \"[Try Again](/wiki/Try_Again_\\(Aaliyah_song\\) \"Try Again \\(Aaliyah song\\)\")\" by [Aaliyah](/wiki/Aaliyah \"Aaliyah\") (June 17, 2000).\n  * [Drake](/wiki/Drake_\\(rapper\\) \"Drake \\(rapper\\)\") holds the record for the most entries in the Hot 100 during a one-week period, with 24 on the April 8, 2017 chart.[104] The Beatles had long held this record, occupying 14 positions on the Hot 100 dated April 11, 1964, a feat unmatched for nearly 51 years. On March 7, 2015, Drake tied the Beatles mark,[153] and he equaled it again on October 17 that year.[154] [Justin Bieber](/wiki/Justin_Bieber \"Justin Bieber\") then reset the record to 17 on December 5, 2015,[155] before Drake reclaimed the record with 20 on May 21, 2016.[154]\n  * Drake also holds the record for the most debuting entries on a Hot 100 chart by any artist, with 21 on April 8, 2017.[104]\n  * [Beyoncé](/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9 \"Beyoncé\") is the record-holder among female artists for the most simultaneous entries in the Hot 100, with 12 on the May 14, 2016 chart.[156]\n  * The Beatles are the only artists to simultaneously hold the top 2 spots on the _Billboard_ Hot 100 singles chart and _Billboard_ 200 albums chart. They achieved this feat for nine consecutive weeks, from February 29, 1964, to April 25, 1964. For the first five weeks of that run, through March 28, 1964, \"[I Want to Hold Your Hand](/wiki/I_Want_to_Hold_Your_Hand \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\")\" and \"[She Loves You](/wiki/She_Loves_You \"She Loves You\")\" were the #1 and #2 singles (which swapped positions during March 1964), while _[Meet the Beatles!](/wiki/Meet_the_Beatles! \"Meet the Beatles!\")_ and _[Introducing... The Beatles](/wiki/Introducing..._The_Beatles \"Introducing... The Beatles\")_ held the top 2 spots on the albums charts. For the remaining weeks of the run, \"[Can't Buy Me Love](/wiki/Can%27t_Buy_Me_Love \"Can't Buy Me Love\")\" and their cover of \"[Twist and Shout](/wiki/Twist_and_Shout \"Twist and Shout\")\" were the #1 and #2 singles, while _Meet the Beatles!_ and _Introducing... The Beatles_ continued their reign as the top 2 albums.[157][158]\n  * Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney hold the record of writing all of the Top 3 singles for one week. The Gibbs co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 18, 1978 – #1 \"Night Fever\" and #2 \"Stayin' Alive\" for the Bee Gees, and #3 \"[Emotion](/wiki/Emotion_\\(Samantha_Sang_song\\) \"Emotion \\(Samantha Sang song\\)\")\" for [Samantha Sang](/wiki/Samantha_Sang \"Samantha Sang\"). Lennon and McCartney co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 14, 1964 – #1 \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", #2 \"She Loves You\", and #3 \"[Please Please Me](/wiki/Please_Please_Me_\\(song\\) \"Please Please Me \\(song\\)\")\", all for The Beatles. They continued this record the following week of March 21, 1964, when \"She Loves You\" switched places with \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\".\n  * The Black Eyed Peas hold the record for the longest uninterrupted time at #1 on the Hot 100, a total of 26 consecutive weeks from April to October 2009. \"Boom Boom Pow\" spent the first 12 weeks on top, with \"I Gotta Feeling\" taking over for the remaining 14 weeks.[159] Prior to August 2009, Usher held this record, spending 19 consecutive weeks on top of the chart in 2004 with \"Yeah!\" (12 weeks at #1) and \"Burn\" (first 7 of its 8 total weeks at #1).[160]\n  * Taylor Swift holds the all-time record for most top ten debuts on the Hot 100, with 14.[161]\n  * On December 4, 2010, Rihanna's \"[Only Girl (In the World)](/wiki/Only_Girl_\\(In_the_World\\) \"Only Girl \\(In the World\\)\")\" reached the top spot two weeks after \"[What's My Name?](/wiki/What%27s_My_Name%3F_\\(Rihanna_song\\) \"What's My Name? \\(Rihanna song\\)\")\", becoming the first time in Hot 100 history that an album's debut single hit #1 after the second single did.[162]\n  * Ed Sheeran became the first artist to debut more than one song in the top 10 for the same week.
