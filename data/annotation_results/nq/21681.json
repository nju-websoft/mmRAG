His first recording of the song\nwas included on his 2005 album _[Time Well Wasted](/wiki/Time_Well_Wasted\n\"Time Well Wasted\")_. Three years later, Paisley re-recorded the song for\ninclusion on a re-issue of his 2007 album _[5th Gear](/wiki/5th_Gear_\\(album\\)\n\"5th Gear \\(album\\)\")_.[1] This re-recorded version was issued on June 9, 2008\nand became the twenty-first chart single of Paisley's career and became the\ntwelfth number 1 single of his career and his eighth consecutive number 1\nsingle. The song also appeared on _[Play](/wiki/Play_\\(Brad_Paisley_album\\)\n\"Play \\(Brad Paisley album\\)\")_ with a guest vocal from [Andy\nGriffith](/wiki/Andy_Griffith \"Andy Griffith\").\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Content\n  * 2 History\n  * 3 Critical reception\n  * 4 Music video\n  * 5 Parody\n  * 6 Chart performance\n    * 6.1 Year-end charts\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n##\nContent[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waitin%27_on_a_Woman&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Content\")]\n\nThe song is a mid-tempo composed of three verses. Its central character is a\nrecently married male sitting on a bench at a [shopping\nmall](/wiki/Shopping_mall \"Shopping mall\"), waiting for his wife to finish\nshopping. He meets an older man ([Andy Griffith](/wiki/Andy_Griffith \"Andy\nGriffith\")) who, like him, is \"waitin' on a woman\". The older man explains\nover the next two verses that, although he has often had to wait for his wife,\nhe does not mind doing so (\"I don't guess we've been anywhere / She hasn't\nmade us late, I swear / Sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it\").[2]\nHe tells the younger man that he will often find himself \"waitin' on a woman\"\nas well. In the third verse, the older male observes that he will most likely\ndie before his wife does (\"I've read somewhere statistics show / The man's\nalways the first to go\"). After making this realization, he finally states\nthat he will wait for his wife in Heaven (should he die first), because he,\ntoo, \"[doesn't] mind waitin' on a woman\". In the end, the old man is seen\nsitting on a white bench, wearing a white suit, on a lone beach, waiting for\nhis wife to join him.\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waitin%27_on_a_Woman&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nAccording to _[Country Weekly](/wiki/Country_Weekly \"Country Weekly\")_\nmagazine, songwriter Wynn Varble received a call from his friend telling him\nthat their former co-worker was in the hospital.[3] Varble wrote the song\nafter calling his co-worker at the hospital, wondering where his wife was. He\ntold \"the story and the idea [he] had for [the song]\" to co-writer Don\nSampson.[3] After a few days, Varble and Sampson played \"Waitin' on a Woman\"\nfor Paisley, and he decided to record it.[3]\n\n## Critical\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waitin%27_on_a_Woman&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Critical reception\")]\n\nThe song received a \"thumbs up\" review from the country music review site\nEngine 145. Reviewer Matt C. stated that the central character (i.e.,\nPaisley's character in the song) \"offer[s] abundant examples of a woman's\nimperfections while portraying himself as the guy who tolerates it all out of\nthe goodness of his heart…look[ing] like a good guy without degrading his\nfemale companion\".[2] He considered it a superior counterpart to Paisley's\nlate 2003-early 2004 single \"[Little Moments](/wiki/Little_Moments \"Little\nMoments\")\" (in which the lead character lists off various mistakes his wife\nhas made before admitting that he \"live[s] for little moments like that\"),\nbut, unlike with \"Little Moments\", the reviewer thought that the gender\nobservations in \"Waitin' on a Woman\" were \"delicately appropriate rather than\ninsensitively obtuse\".[2] Leeann Ward, reviewing the song for Country\nUniverse, gave it a B rating. Ward said that while the song with its \"sluggish\nmelody, is built on the stereotype that a woman is always late, there is a\nsweetness about the sentiment’s presentation that rescues it.\" [4]\n\n## Music\nvideo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waitin%27_on_a_Woman&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Music video\")]\n\nPaisley has referred to \"Waitin' on a Woman\" as \"one of the most important\nsongs\" that he's ever recorded. Because of the importance that he places on\nthe song, Paisley asked [Andy Griffith](/wiki/Andy_Griffith \"Andy Griffith\")\nto star in the [music video](/wiki/Music_video \"Music video\"), as he felt that\nGriffith's personality matched the personality of the older man in the\nsong.[1] Griffith speaks the old man's lines in the video as well.[5] Jim Shea\nand Peter Tilden directed the video.\n\nIn August 2008, the song's video mix, complete with Griffith's vocals, was\nsent to radio as well. This mix is also included on Paisley's 2008 album\n_[Play](/wiki/Play_\\(Brad_Paisley_album\\) \"Play \\(Brad Paisley album\\)\")_.\n\nThe video was shot in [Nags Head, North\nCarolina](/wiki/Nags_Head,_North_Carolina \"Nags Head, North Carolina\") at\nmilepost 16's [Tanger Outlets](/wiki/Tanger_Factory_Outlet_Centers \"Tanger\nFactory Outlet Centers\").\n\n## Parody[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waitin%27_on_a_Woman&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Parody\")]\n\nIn January 2009, parodist [Cledus T. Judd](/wiki/Cledus_T._Judd \"Cledus T.\nJudd\") released a parody entitled \"Waitin' on Obama\", referencing [Barack\nObama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\")'s election as [President of the\nUnited States](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\").[6]\n\n## Chart\nperformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waitin%27_on_a_Woman&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Chart performance\")]\n\n\"Waitin' on a Woman\" debuted at number 51 on the\n_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_ [Hot\nCountry Songs](/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs \"Hot Country Songs\") chart dated for\nthe week of June 28, 2008.[7] For the chart week of September 20, 2008, it has\nbecome Paisley's twelfth Number One single overall.\n\nChart (2008)  | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nCanada ([Canadian Hot 100](/wiki/Canadian_Hot_100 \"Canadian Hot 100\"))[8] | 59   \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[9] | 44   \nUS [Hot Country Songs](/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs \"Hot Country Songs\") (_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_)[10] | 1   \n  \n### Year-end\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waitin%27_on_a_Woman&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Year-end charts\")]\n\nChart (2008)  | Position   \n---|---  \nUS [Country Songs](/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs \"Hot Country Songs\") (_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_)[11] | 19   \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waitin%27_on_a_Woman&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [\"Andy Griffith Stars in Brad's New Video\"](http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,3034,GAC_26063_5882752_,00.html). _[Great American Country](/wiki/Great_American_Country \"Great American Country\")_. 2008-06-10.
