Employers generally must pay workers the highest [minimum\nwage](/wiki/Minimum_wage \"Minimum wage\") prescribed by federal, state, and\nlocal law. As of July 2016, the [federal\ngovernment](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal government\nof the United States\") mandates a nationwide minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.\nAs of October 2016, there are 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the\nfederal minimum. From 2014 to 2015, nine states increased their minimum wage\nlevels through automatic adjustments, while increases in 11 other states\noccurred through referendum or legislative action. In real terms, the federal\nminimum wage peaked near $10.00 per hour in 1968, using 2014 [inflation-\nadjusted dollars](/wiki/Constant_dollars \"Constant dollars\").[1]\n\nBeginning in January 2017, Massachusetts and Washington state will have the\nhighest minimum wages, Aside from Santa Fe NM, which is currently at $11.09\nwhich is still #1 for Highest Min Wage in the country. Massachusetts and\nWashington state come in #2.[2] New York City's minimum wage will be $15.00\nper hour by the end of 2018.[3] There is a racial difference for support of a\nhigher minimum wage with most black and Hispanic individuals supporting a\n$15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of whites opposing it.[4] In 2015, about\n3 percent of White, Asian, and Hispanic or Latino workers earned the federal\nminimum wage or less. Among Black workers, the percentage was about 4\npercent.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 20th century\n    * 1.2 Legislation, 21st century\n    * 1.3 Local ordinances\n    * 1.4 Union exemptions\n  * 2 Trends in purchasing power\n  * 3 Economic effects\n    * 3.1 Employment and job creation\n    * 3.2 Prices\n    * 3.3 Crime increase\n    * 3.4 Economic growth\n    * 3.5 Income inequality\n    * 3.6 Poverty\n    * 3.7 Federal budget deficit\n  * 4 Commentary\n    * 4.1 Economists\n    * 4.2 Politicians\n  * 5 Polls\n  * 6 List by jurisdiction\n    * 6.1 Federal\n    * 6.2 State\n    * 6.3 Territory\n    * 6.4 Federal District\n  * 7 Jobs affected, 2006, 2009\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### 20th\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: 20th century\")]\n\n[![\\[icon\\]](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg) | **This section needs expansion**.

Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that\nthey would be upheld under the precedent of _[Muller v.\nOregon](/wiki/Muller_v._Oregon \"Muller v. Oregon\")_ , which had upheld maximum\nworking hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special\nprotection which men did not.[7] However, the Court did not extend this\nprinciple to minimum wage laws, considering the latter as interfering with the\nability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees.[6]:518\n\nNo business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to\nits workers has any right to continue in this country.\n\n[President Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt](/wiki/President_Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt \"President Franklin\nDelano Roosevelt\"), 1933[8]\n\nIn 1933, the [Roosevelt\nadministration](/wiki/Presidency_of_Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Presidency of\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\") made the first attempt at establishing a national\nminimum wage, when a $0.25 per hour standard was set as part of the [National\nIndustrial Recovery Act](/wiki/National_Industrial_Recovery_Act \"National\nIndustrial Recovery Act\"). However, in the 1935 court case _[Schechter Poultry\nCorp. v. United States](/wiki/Schechter_Poultry_Corp._v._United_States\n\"Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States\")_ (295 U.S. 495), the US Supreme\nCourt declared the act unconstitutional, and the minimum wage was abolished.\nIn 1938, the minimum wage was re-established pursuant to the [Fair Labor\nStandards Act](/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act \"Fair Labor Standards Act\"),\nonce again at $0.25 per hour ($4.23 in 2015 dollars[9]). In 1941, the Supreme\nCourt upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act in _[United States v. Darby Lumber\nCo.](/wiki/United_States_v._Darby_Lumber_Co. \"United States v. Darby Lumber\nCo.\")_ , holding that Congress had the power under the [Commerce\nClause](/wiki/Commerce_Clause \"Commerce Clause\") to regulate employment\nconditions.[10]\n\nThe 1938 minimum wage law only applied to \"employees engaged in interstate\ncommerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce,\" but in\namendments in 1961 and 1966, the federal minimum wage was extended (with\nslightly different rates) to employees in large retail and service\nenterprises, local transportation and construction, state and local government\nemployees, as well as other smaller expansions; a grandfather clause in 1990\ndrew most employees into the purview of federal minimum wage policy, which now\nset the wage at $3.80.[11]\n\n### Legislation, 21st\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Legislation, 21st century\")]\n\nIn 2006, voters in six states ([Arizona](/wiki/Arizona \"Arizona\"),\n[Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\"), [Missouri](/wiki/Missouri \"Missouri\"),\n[Montana](/wiki/Montana \"Montana\"), [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada \"Nevada\"), and\n[Ohio](/wiki/Ohio \"Ohio\")) approved statewide increases in the state minimum\nwage. The amounts of these increases ranged from $1 to $1.70 per hour and all\nincreases were designed to annually index to [inflation](/wiki/Inflation\n\"Inflation\").[12] Some politicians in the United States have advocated linking\nthe minimum wage to the [Consumer Price Index](/wiki/Consumer_Price_Index\n\"Consumer Price Index\"), thereby increasing the wage automatically each year\nbased on increases to the Consumer Price Index. So far, [Ohio](/wiki/Ohio\n\"Ohio\"), [Oregon](/wiki/Oregon \"Oregon\"), [Missouri](/wiki/Missouri\n\"Missouri\"), [Vermont](/wiki/Vermont \"Vermont\") and\n[Washington](/wiki/Washington_\\(state\\) \"Washington \\(state\\)\") have linked\ntheir minimum wages to the consumer price index. Minimum wage indexing also\ntakes place each year in [Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\"), [San\nFrancisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\"), California, and [Santa Fe,\nNew Mexico](/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico \"Santa Fe, New Mexico\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe federal minimum wage in the United States was reset to its current rate of\n$7.25 per hour in July 2009.[11] Some U.S. territories (such as [American\nSamoa](/wiki/American_Samoa \"American Samoa\")) are exempt. Some types of labor\nare also exempt: employers may pay [tipped labor](/wiki/Tip_\\(gratuity\\) \"Tip\n\\(gratuity\\)\") a minimum of $2.13 per hour, as long as the hour wage plus tip\nincome equals at least the minimum wage. Persons under the age of 20 may be\npaid $4.25 an hour for the first 90 calendar days of employment (sometimes\nknown as a youth, teen, or training wage) unless a higher state minimum\nexists.[13] The 2009 increase was the last of three steps of the [Fair Minimum\nWage Act of 2007](/wiki/Fair_Minimum_Wage_Act_of_2007 \"Fair Minimum Wage Act\nof 2007\"), which was signed into law as a [rider](/wiki/Rider_\\(legislation\\)\n\"Rider \\(legislation\\)\") to the [U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina\nRecovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act,\n2007](/wiki/U.S._Troop_Readiness,_Veterans%27_Care,_Katrina_Recovery,_and_Iraq_Accountability_Appropriations_Act,_2007\n\"U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq\nAccountability Appropriations Act, 2007\"), a bill that also contained almost\n$5 billion in tax cuts for small businesses.\n\nIn April 2014, the U.S. Senate debated the [Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S.\n1737; 113th\nCongress)](/wiki/Minimum_Wage_Fairness_Act_\\(S._1737;_113th_Congress\\)\n\"Minimum Wage Fairness Act \\(S. 1737; 113th Congress\\)\"). The bill would have\namended the [Fair Labor Standards Act of\n1938](/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938 \"Fair Labor Standards Act of\n1938\") (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per\nhour over the course of a two-year period.[14] The bill was strongly supported\nby President [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\") and many of the\nDemocratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and\nHouse.[15][16][17] Later in 2014, voters in the Republican-controlled states\nof Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota considered ballot initiatives\nto raise the minimum wage above the national rate of $7.25 per hour, which\nwere successful in all 4 states. The results provided evidence that raising\nminimum wage has support across party lines.[18]\n\nSince 2012, a growing protest and advocacy movement called \"[Fight for\n$15](/wiki/Fight_for_$15 \"Fight for $15\")\", initially growing out of [fast\nfood worker strikes](/wiki/Fast_food_worker_strikes \"Fast food worker\nstrikes\"), has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage. On March 27,\n2014, [Connecticut](/wiki/Connecticut \"Connecticut\") passed legislation to\nraise the minimum wage from $8.70 to $10.10 by 2017, making it one of about\nsix states to aim at or above $10.00 per hour.[19] In 2014 and 2015, several\ncities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Washington passed\nordinances that gradually increase the minimum wage to $15.00.[20][21] In\n2016, New York and California passed legislation that would gradually raise\nthe minimum wage to $15 in each state.[22][23]\n\nAs of 2017, recent legislation was passed in multiple states to raise the\nminimum wage a certain amount in a certain amount of time. California is set\nto raise their minimum wage to $15.00/hour by January 1, 2023.[24] Colorado is\nset to raise their minimum wage from $9.30/hour to $12/hour by January 1,\n2020, raising $0.90 per year.[25] Seattle passed legislation in 2015 for a\nraise in minimum wage; for employers of 500 or more employees without heath\nbenefits, the minimum wage will be raised to $15.00/hour by 2017, for\nemployees with heath benefits, the minimum wage will raise to $15.00/hour by\n2018, for smaller employees the $15.00/hour wage will be reached at different\ntimes. Seattle is one of the first cities to put in place a plan that after\n$15.00/hour wage is reached, they will continue to increase minimum wage by a\ncertain percentage every year based on inflation changes. [26] New York has\nalso recently passed legislation to increase their minimum wage to $15.00/hour\nover time, certain counties and larger companies are set on faster plans than\nothers. [27] As there have only been a few places mentioned, cities and states\nacross the United States are putting in place certain legislation to increase\nthe minimum wage for minimum wage workers to a livable wage. Time will only\ntell the effects on the economy and number of jobs in those cities and\nstates.[28]\n\n### Local\nordinances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Local ordinances\")]\n\nOn June 2, 2014, the [City Council](/wiki/City_Council \"City Council\") of\n[Seattle, Washington](/wiki/Seattle,_Washington \"Seattle, Washington\") passed\na [local ordinance](/wiki/Local_ordinance \"Local ordinance\") to increase the\nminimum wage of the city to $15.00 per hour,[29] giving the city the highest\nminimum wage in the United States,[30][31] which will be phased in over seven\nyears, to be fully implemented by 2021.[32] A growing number of California\ncities have enacted local minimum wage ordinances, including [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\"), [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco\n\"San Francisco\"), [Oakland](/wiki/Oakland,_California \"Oakland, California\"),\n[Berkeley](/wiki/Berkeley,_California \"Berkeley, California\"),\n[Emeryville](/wiki/Emeryville,_California \"Emeryville, California\"), [Mountain\nView](/wiki/Mountain_View,_California \"Mountain View, California\"),\n[Richmond](/wiki/Richmond,_California \"Richmond, California\"), and [San\nJose](/wiki/San_Jose,_California \"San Jose, California\").\n\nIn September 2014, the [Los Angeles City\nCouncil](/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Council \"Los Angeles City Council\") approved a\nminimum salary for hotel workers of $15.37 per hour.[33] In April 2016, The\n[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles Times\") reported that\nthere is an exemption for unionised workers, and interviewed longtime workers\nat unionised Sheraton Universal who make $10.00 per hour, whereas non-union\nemployees at a non-union Hilton a few feet away make at least the $15.37\nmandated by law for non-unionised employees.[34] Similar exemptions have been\nadopted in San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, and Santa Monica.\n\nSan Francisco is expected to become the first U.S. city to reach a minimum\nwage of $15.00 per hour on July 1, 2018, .[35] The minimum wage in Los Angeles\nand Washington, D.C., will be $15.00 per hour in 2020.[36][37]\n\nOn August 18, 2015, the [El Cerrito City Council](/wiki/El_Cerrito,_California\n\"El Cerrito, California\") directed city staff to draft a local minimum wage\nordinance based on a template provided by a coalition for a county-wide\nminimum wage effort. The details are not final, but the Council discussed an\ninitial increase of roughly 28–36% ($11.52 – $12.25 or more) by January 1,\n2016, with annual increases that will result in a $15.00 hourly wage rate by\n2018–2020. The Council did not direct staff to create small business\nexemptions (or any other exemptions), but a slower phase-in rate may be\nconsidered for employees of small businesses. The city will have outreach for\nresidents and business owners to discuss the details of the proposed\nordinance. Staff hopes to present a draft for The Council's approval as early\nas October or November 2015.[38]\n\n### Union\nexemptions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Union exemptions\")]\n\nAs of December 2014, unions were exempt from recent minimum wage increases in\n[Chicago, Illinois](/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois \"Chicago, Illinois\"), [SeaTac,\nWashington](/wiki/SeaTac,_Washington \"SeaTac, Washington\"), and [Milwaukee\nCounty, Wisconsin](/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin \"Milwaukee County,\nWisconsin\"), as well as the California cities of [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\"), [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco\n\"San Francisco\"), [Long Beach](/wiki/Long_Beach,_California \"Long Beach,\nCalifornia\"), [San Jose](/wiki/San_Jose,_California \"San Jose, California\"),\n[Richmond](/wiki/Richmond,_California \"Richmond, California\"), and\n[Oakland](/wiki/Oakland,_California \"Oakland, California\").[39] In 2016, the\n[Washington, D.C. Council](/wiki/Council_of_the_District_of_Columbia \"Council\nof the District of Columbia\") passed a minimum wage ordinance that included a\nunion waiver, but Mayor Vincent Gray vetoed it. Later that year, the council\napproved an increase without the union waiver.[40]\n\n## Trends in purchasing\npower[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Trends in purchasing power\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/History_of_US_federal_minimum_wage_increases.svg/400px-\nHistory_of_US_federal_minimum_wage_increases.svg.png)](/wiki/File:History_of_US_federal_minimum_wage_increases.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:History_of_US_federal_minimum_wage_increases.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nHistory of the federal minimum wage in real 2013 dollars and nominal dollars.\n\nSince its inception the [purchasing power](/wiki/Purchasing_power \"Purchasing\npower\") of the minimum wage has fluctuated. The minimum wage had its highest\npurchasing power in 1968, when it was $1.60 per hour ($11.49 in 2017\ndollars).[9][1] From January 1981 to April 1990, the minimum wage was frozen\nat $3.35 per hour, then a record-setting minimum wage freeze. From September\n1, 1997 through July 23, 2007, the federal minimum wage remained constant at\n$5.15 per hour, breaking the old record. From the [United States Department of\nLabor](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor \"United States Department of\nLabor\"). [Employment Standards\nAdministration](/wiki/Employment_Standards_Administration \"Employment\nStandards Administration\"). [Wage and Hour\nDivision](/wiki/Wage_and_Hour_Division \"Wage and Hour Division\"), the source\npage has a clickable US map with current and projected state-by-state minimum\nwage rates for each state. Some government entities, such as counties and\ncities, observe minimum wages that are higher than the state as a whole. One\nnotable example of this is [Santa Fe, New Mexico](/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico\n\"Santa Fe, New Mexico\"), whose $9.50 per hour minimum wage was the highest in\nthe nation,[41][42][43] until San Francisco increased its minimum wage to\n$9.79 in 2009.[44] Another device to increase wages, [living\nwage](/wiki/Living_wage \"Living wage\") ordinances, generally apply only to\nbusinesses that are under contract to the local government itself.\n\nSince 1984, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has decreased.\nMeasured in real terms (adjusted for inflation) using 1984 dollars, the real\nminimum wage was $3.35 in 1984, $2.33 in 1994, $1.84 in 2004, and $1.46 in\n2014[9]. If the minimum wage had been raised to $10.10 in 2014, that would\nhave equated to $4.40 in 1984 dollars.[45][46] This would have been equal to a\n31% increase in purchasing power, despite the nominal value of the minimum\nwage increasing by 216% in the same time period.\n\n## Economic\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Economic effects\")]\n\nThe economic effects of raising the minimum wage are controversial. Adjusting\nthe minimum wage may affect current and future levels of employment, prices of\ngoods and services, economic growth, income inequality and poverty. The\ninterconnection of price levels, central bank policy, wage agreements, and\ntotal aggregate demand creates a situation in which the conclusions drawn from\nmacroeconomic analysis are highly influenced by the underlying assumptions of\nthe interpreter.[47]\n\n### Employment and job\ncreation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Employment and job creation\")]\n\nFurther information: [Unemployment in the United\nStates](/wiki/Unemployment_in_the_United_States \"Unemployment in the United\nStates\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/CBO_Projected_Effects_of_Minimum_Wage_Increases_v1.png/260px-\nCBO_Projected_Effects_of_Minimum_Wage_Increases_v1.png)](/wiki/File:CBO_Projected_Effects_of_Minimum_Wage_Increases_v1.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CBO_Projected_Effects_of_Minimum_Wage_Increases_v1.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nCBO table with projections of the effects of minimum wage increases on\nemployment and income, under two scenarios\n\nThe [law of demand](/wiki/Law_of_demand \"Law of demand\") states that—all else\nbeing equal—raising the price of any particular good or service will reduce\nthe quantity demanded. Thus, [neoclassical\neconomics](/wiki/Neoclassical_economics \"Neoclassical economics\") argues\nthat—all else being equal—raising in the minimum wage will have adverse\naffects on employment.\n\nConceptually, if an employer does not believe a worker generates value equal\nto or in excess of the minimum wage, that worker will not be hired or\nretained.[48]\n\nEmpirical work on fast food workers in the 1990s challenged the neoclassical\nmodel. In 1994, economists [David Card](/wiki/David_Card \"David Card\") and\n[Alan Krueger](/wiki/Alan_Krueger \"Alan Krueger\") studied employment trends\namong 410 restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania following New\nJersey's minimum wage hike (from $4.25 to $5.05) in April 1992. They found \"no\nindication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.\"[49] However,\na 1995 re-analysis of the evidence by [David Neumark](/wiki/David_Neumark\n\"David Neumark\") found that the increase in New Jersey's minimum wage actually\nresulted in a 4.6% decrease in employment.[50] Neumark's study relied on\npayroll records from a sample of large fast-food restaurant chains, whereas\nthe Card-Krueger study relied on business surveys.\n\nAdditional research conducted by David Neumark and William Wascher (which\nsurveyed over 100 studies related to the employment effects of minimum wages)\nfound that the majority of peer-reviewed economic research (about two-thirds)\nshowed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased\nunemployment—especially for young and unskilled workers. Neumark's analysis\nfurther found that, when looking at only the most credible research, 85% of\nstudies showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased\nunemployment.[51]\n\nIn February 2014, the [Congressional Budget\nOffice](/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office \"Congressional Budget Office\") (CBO)\nreported the theoretical effects of a federal minimum wage increase under two\nscenarios: an increase to $9.00 and an increase to $10.10. According to the\nreport, approximately 100,000 jobs would be lost under the $9.00 option,\nwhereas 500,000 jobs would be lost under the $10.10 option (with a wide range\nof possible outcomes).[52]\n\n[![Funnel Graph of Estimated Minimum Wage\nEffects.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Funnel_Graph_of_Estimated_Minimum_Wage_Effects.jpg/260px-\nFunnel_Graph_of_Estimated_Minimum_Wage_Effects.jpg)](/wiki/File:Funnel_Graph_of_Estimated_Minimum_Wage_Effects.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Funnel_Graph_of_Estimated_Minimum_Wage_Effects.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA 2013 [Center for Economic and Policy\nResearch](/wiki/Center_for_Economic_and_Policy_Research \"Center for Economic\nand Policy Research\") (CEPR) review of multiple studies since 2000 indicated\nthat there was \"little or no employment response to modest increases in the\nminimum wage.\"[53] Another CEPR study in 2014 found that job creation within\nthe United States is faster within states that raised their minimum wage.[54]\nIn 2014, the state with the highest minimum wage in the nation, Washington,\nexceeded the national average for job growth in the United States.[55]\n\nA 2012 study led by Joseph Sabia, professor of economics at the [University of\nNew Hampshire](/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire \"University of New\nHampshire\"), estimated that the 2004-6 New York State minimum wage increase\n(from $5.15 to $6.75) resulted in a 20.2% to 21.8% reduction in employment for\nless-skilled, less-educated workers.[56] Another study conducted by Joseph\nSabia, then an assistant professor at [American\nUniversity](/wiki/American_University \"American University\"), found that\nminimum wages were ineffective at alleviating poverty for single mothers. The\nstudy further concluded that a 10% increase in the minimum wage was associated\nwith an 8.8% reduction in employment and an 11.8% reduction in hours for\nuneducated single mothers.[57]\n\nResearch conducted by Richard Burkhauser, professor emeritus of Policy\nAnalysis at [Cornell University](/wiki/Cornell_University \"Cornell\nUniversity\"), concluded that minimum wage increases \"significantly reduce the\nemployment of the most vulnerable groups in the working-age population—young\nadults without a high school degree (aged 20-24), young black adults and\nteenagers (aged 16-24), and teenagers (aged 16-19).\"[58]\n\nA 2007 study by Daniel Aaronson and Eric French concluded that a 10% increase\nin the minimum wage decreased low-skill employment by 2-4% and total\nrestaurant employment by 1-3%.[59]\n\n_The Economist_ wrote in December 2013: \"A minimum wage, providing it is not\nset too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...Some studies\nfind no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a\nsmall one, but none finds any serious damage...High minimum wages, however,\nparticularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has\nthe rich world’s highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults\nand a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps\nexplain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26%\nfor 15- to 24-year-olds.\"[60]\n\n###\nPrices[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Prices\")]\n\nConceptually—all else being equal—raising the minimum wage will increase the\ncost of labor. Thus, employers may accept lower profits, raise their prices,\nor both. If prices increase, consumers may demand a lesser quantity of the\nproduct, substitute other products, or switch to imported products. Marginal\nproducers (those who are barely profitable enough to survive) may be forced\nout of business if they cannot raise their prices sufficiently to offset the\nhigher cost of labor. Whether the increased income of the workers benefiting\nfrom the minimum wage increase can offset these effects is debatable.[48]\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago research from 2007 has shown that restaurant\nprices rise in response to minimum wage increases.[61]\n\n### Crime\nincrease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Crime increase\")]\n\nA 2016 White House report based on \"back of envelope calculations and\nliterature review\" argued that higher hourly wages led to less crime.[62]\n\nA report by the [Council of Economic\nAdvisers](/wiki/Council_of_Economic_Advisers \"Council of Economic Advisers\")\nclaimed that \"raising the minimum wage reduces crime by 3 to 5 percent.\" To\nget those numbers, the study assumed that \"such a minimum wage increase would\nhave no employment impacts, with an employment elasticity of 0.1 the benefits\nwould be somewhat lower.\"[62]\n\nHowever, In a 1987 journal article based on actual study data, Masanori\nHashimoto noted that minimum wage hikes lead to increased levels of property\ncrime in areas affected by the minimum wage after its increase.[63] According\nto the article, by decreasing employment in poor communities, total legal\ntrade and production are curtailed. The report also claimed that in order to\ncompensate for the decrease in legal avenues for production and consumption,\npoor communities increasingly turn to illegal trade and activity.[63]\n\n### Economic\ngrowth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Economic growth\")]\n\nWhether growth (GDP, a measure of both income and production) increases or\ndecreases depends significantly on whether the income shifted from owners to\nworkers results in an overall higher level of spending. The tendency of a\nconsumer to spend their next dollar is referred to as the [marginal propensity\nto consume](/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consume \"Marginal propensity to\nconsume\") or MPC. The transfer of income from higher income owners (who tend\nto save more, meaning a lower MPC) to lower income workers (who tend to save\nless, with a higher MPC) can actually lead to an increase in total consumption\nand higher demand for goods, leading to increased employment.[52] Recent\nresearch has shown that higher wages lead to greater productivity. [64]\n\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that income (GDP) overall would be\nmarginally higher after raising the minimum wage, indicating a small net\npositive increase in growth. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 and indexing\nit to inflation would result in a net $2 billion increase in income during the\nsecond half of 2016, while raising it to $9.00 and not indexing it would\nresult in a net $1 billion increase in income.[52]\n\n### Income\ninequality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Income inequality\")]\n\nFurther information: [Income inequality in the United\nStates](/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States \"Income inequality in the\nUnited States\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Minimum_Wage_Divided_by_Median_Wage_in_OECD_Countries_2011.jpg/220px-\nMinimum_Wage_Divided_by_Median_Wage_in_OECD_Countries_2011.jpg)](/wiki/File:Minimum_Wage_Divided_by_Median_Wage_in_OECD_Countries_2011.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Minimum_Wage_Divided_by_Median_Wage_in_OECD_Countries_2011.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nMinimum wage levels in developed economies as a share of median full-time\nwage.

The CBO estimated in\nFebruary 2014 that raising the minimum wage under either scenario described\nabove would improve income inequality. Families with income more than 6 times\nthe poverty threshold would see their incomes fall (due in part to their\nbusiness profits declining with higher employee costs), while families with\nincomes below that threshold would rise.[52]\n\n###\nPoverty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Poverty\")]\n\nAmong hourly-paid workers In 2016, 701,000 earned the federal minimum wage and\nabout 1.5 million earned wages below the minimum.
