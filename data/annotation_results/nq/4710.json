[Asia](/wiki/Asia \"Asia\") or the\n'[Eastern world](/wiki/Eastern_world \"Eastern world\")'.\n\nIt is commonly reported that the colonisation of Australia was driven by the\nneed to address overcrowding in the British prison system, and the fact of the\nBritish losing the [Thirteen Colonies of America](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies\n\"Thirteen Colonies\") in the [American Revolution](/wiki/American_Revolution\n\"American Revolution\"); however, it was simply not economically viable to\ntransport convicts halfway around the world for this reason alone.[1] Many\nconvicts were either skilled tradesmen or farmers who had been convicted for\ntrivial crimes and were sentenced to seven years transportation, the time\nrequired to set up the infrastructure for the new colony. Convicts were often\ngiven pardons prior to or on completion of their sentences and were allocated\nparcels of land to farm.\n\n[Sir Joseph Banks](/wiki/Sir_Joseph_Banks \"Sir Joseph Banks\"), the eminent\nscientist who had accompanied Lieutenant [James Cook](/wiki/James_Cook \"James\nCook\") on his 1770 voyage, recommended [Botany Bay](/wiki/Botany_Bay \"Botany\nBay\") as a suitable site.[2] Banks accepted an offer of assistance which by\nthe American [Loyalist](/wiki/Loyalist_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Loyalist\n\\(American Revolution\\)\") [James Matra](/wiki/James_Matra \"James Matra\") in\nJuly 1783. Matra had visited Botany Bay with Banks in 1770 as a junior officer\non the _Endeavour_ commanded by James Cook. Under Banks's guidance, he rapidly\nproduced \"A Proposal for Establishing a Settlement in New South Wales\" (24\nAugust 1783), with a fully developed set of reasons for a colony composed of\nAmerican Loyalists, Chinese and South Sea Islanders (but not convicts).[3]\n\nFollowing an interview with Secretary of State [Lord\nSydney](/wiki/Thomas_Townshend,_1st_Viscount_Sydney \"Thomas Townshend, 1st\nViscount Sydney\") in March 1784, Matra amended his proposal to include\nconvicts as settlers.[4] Matra’s plan can be seen to have “provided the\noriginal blueprint for settlement in New South Wales”.[5] A cabinet memorandum\nDecember 1784 shows the Government had Matra’s plan in mind when considering\nthe creation of a settlement in New South Wales.[5][6] _The London Chronicle_\nof 12 October 1786 said: “Mr. Matra, an Officer of the Treasury, who, sailing\nwith Capt. Cook, had an opportunity of visiting Botany Bay, is the Gentleman\nwho suggested the plan to Government of transporting convicts to that island”.\nThe Government also incorporated into the colonisation plan the project for\nsettling Norfolk Island, with its attractions of timber and flax, proposed by\nBanks’s Royal Society colleagues, Sir John Call and Sir George Young.[7]\n\nOn 13 May 1787, the [First Fleet](/wiki/First_Fleet \"First Fleet\") of 11 ships\nand about 1,530 people (736 convicts, 17 convicts' children, 211 marines, 27\nmarines' wives, 14 marines' children and about 300 officers and others) under\nthe command of [Captain Arthur Phillip](/wiki/Arthur_Phillip \"Arthur Phillip\")\nset sail for Botany Bay.[8][9][10] A few days after arrival at [Botany\nBay](/wiki/Botany_Bay \"Botany Bay\") the fleet moved to the more suitable [Port\nJackson](/wiki/Port_Jackson \"Port Jackson\") where a settlement was established\nat [Sydney Cove](/wiki/Sydney_Cove \"Sydney Cove\") on 26 January 1788.[11] This\ndate later became Australia's national day, [Australia\nDay](/wiki/Australia_Day \"Australia Day\"). The colony was formally proclaimed\nby Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788 at Sydney. Sydney Cove offered a fresh\nwater supply and a safe harbour, which Philip famously described as:[12]\n\n> “ | being with out exception the finest Harbour in the World [...] Here a Thousand Sail of the Line may ride in the most perfect Security. | ”  \n> ---|---|---  \n  \nPhillip named the settlement after the [Home\nSecretary](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Home_Department \"Secretary of\nState for the Home Department\"), [Thomas Townshend, 1st Baron\nSydney](/wiki/Thomas_Townshend,_1st_Viscount_Sydney \"Thomas Townshend, 1st\nViscount Sydney\") ([Viscount Sydney](/wiki/Viscount_Sydney \"Viscount Sydney\")\nfrom 1789). The only people at the flag raising ceremony and the formal taking\nof possession of the land in the name of King George III were Phillip and a\nfew dozen marines and officers from the _Supply_ , the rest of the ship's\ncompany and the convicts witnessing it from on board ship. The remaining ships\nof the Fleet were unable to leave Botany Bay until later on 26 January because\nof a tremendous gale.[13] The new colony was formally proclaimed as the Colony\nof New South Wales on 7 February.[14]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Very_early_map_of_sydney_from_1789.jpg/250px-\nVery_early_map_of_sydney_from_1789.jpg)](/wiki/File:Very_early_map_of_sydney_from_1789.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Very_early_map_of_sydney_from_1789.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA map of Sydney from 1789\n\nOn 24 January 1788 a French expedition of two ships led by Admiral [Jean-\nFrançois de La Pérouse](/wiki/Jean-\nFran%C3%A7ois_de_Galaup,_comte_de_La_P%C3%A9rouse \"Jean-François de Galaup,\ncomte de La Pérouse\") had arrived off Botany Bay, on the latest leg of a\nthree-year voyage that had taken them from Brest, around Cape Horn, up the\ncoast from Chile to California, north-west to Kamchatka, south-east to Easter\nIsland, north-west to Macao, and on to the Philippines, the Friendly Isles,\nHawaii and Norfolk Island.[15] Though amicably received, the French expedition\nwas a troublesome matter for the British, as it showed the interest of France\nin the new land.\n\nNevertheless, on 2 February Lieutenant King, at Phillip's request, paid a\ncourtesy call on the French and offered them any assistance they may need.[13]\nThe French made the same offer to the British, as they were much better\nprovisioned than the British and had enough supplies to last three years.[13]\nNeither of these offers was accepted. On 10 March[13] the French expedition,\nhaving taken on water and wood, left Botany Bay, never to be seen again.\nPhillip and La Pérouse never met. La Pérouse is remembered in [a Sydney\nsuburb](/wiki/La_Perouse,_New_South_Wales \"La Perouse, New South Wales\") of\nthat name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast\nalso date from this expedition.\n\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of\nthe colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations\nwith local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the\nconvicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers – most notably\n[Watkin Tench](/wiki/Watkin_Tench \"Watkin Tench\") – left behind journals and\naccounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of\nsettlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South\nWales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas\nwere few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female\nconvicts were landed at Sydney – many \"professional criminals\" with few of the\nskills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also\nsick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only\ndeteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food\nsituation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally\narrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \"passengers\" through sickness,\nwhile the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From\n1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade\nlessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.[16]\n\nIn 1792, two French ships, _La Recherche_ and _L 'Espérance_ anchored in a\nharbour near Tasmania's southernmost point they called [Recherche\nBay](/wiki/Recherche_Bay \"Recherche Bay\"). This was at a time when Britain and\nFrance were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The\nexpedition carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and\nhydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded\nand documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they\nencountered at the behest of the fledgling Société D'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a\ndetachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the\ncolony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was\neloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \"From the disposition to crimes\nand the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium\nwas, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word\n\"Botany Bay\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon\nevery one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon\nthose who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of\none's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and\ndearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have\njustly merited that distinction\".[17]\n\n### Convicts and free\nsettlers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Australia_\\(1788%E2%80%931850\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Convicts and free settlers\")]\n\nWhen the _Bellona_ transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793,\nshe brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas\nRose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant\nof 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS\n_Sirius_ ; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the\n_Sirius_), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had\nformerly been at Sydney with the _Juliana_ transport, and who married a free\nwoman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant\nof 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\n\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with\na free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the\nGovernment, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of\nexpense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of\nconvicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's\nclothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to\nthe westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \"Liberty Plains\". It\nis now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\n\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom\nwere transported in connection with the [political](/wiki/Irish_republicanism\n\"Irish republicanism\") and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the\ntime. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration\nhad been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting – few\nof the first wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers),\nand the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial\nattempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers\nwere able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send\na ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the [Second\nFleet](/wiki/Second_Fleet_\\(Australia\\) \"Second Fleet \\(Australia\\)\") in 1790,\nbut life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Poster_australia_NZ_1788_1911_shepherd_1923.png/220px-\nPoster_australia_NZ_1788_1911_shepherd_1923.png)](/wiki/File:Poster_australia_NZ_1788_1911_shepherd_1923.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Poster_australia_NZ_1788_1911_shepherd_1923.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA historical map of Australia and New Zealand 1788–1911\n\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' [penal\nservitude](/wiki/Penal_servitude \"Penal servitude\"), or \"for the term of their\nnatural lives\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death\nsentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes.\nUpon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of\nwork. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for\nexample, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work\ngangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually\nassigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into\nprostitution.[18]\n\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be\nresponsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the\nsettlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central\nadministration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at\nbarracks such as the [Hyde Park Barracks](/wiki/Hyde_Park_Barracks,_Sydney\n\"Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney\") or the [Parramatta female\nfactory](/wiki/Parramatta_female_factory \"Parramatta female factory\").\n\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed\norders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-\nirons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at\n[Port Arthur](/wiki/Port_Arthur,_Tasmania \"Port Arthur, Tasmania\") and\n[Moreton Bay](/wiki/Moreton_Bay \"Moreton Bay\"), for instance, were stricter\nthan the one at Sydney, and the one at [Norfolk Island](/wiki/Norfolk_Island\n\"Norfolk Island\") was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs\nto build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of\nthe convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers.\nThose convicts who behaved were eventually issued with [ticket of\nleave](/wiki/Ticket_of_leave#Australian_convicts \"Ticket of leave\"), which\nallowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full\nsentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free\nsettlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\n\nIn 1789 former convict [James Ruse](/wiki/James_Ruse \"James Ruse\") produced\nthe first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790\nand, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was\nrewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South\nWales. Ruse's 30 acre grant at Rose Hill, near\n[Parramatta](/wiki/Parramatta,_New_South_Wales \"Parramatta, New South Wales\"),\nwas aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.[19] This was the colony's first successful\nfarming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to\ngrow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the\nresidents gradually improved.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Castle_hill_irish_rebellion_of_1804_australia.jpg/220px-\nCastle_hill_irish_rebellion_of_1804_australia.jpg)](/wiki/File:Castle_hill_irish_rebellion_of_1804_australia.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Castle_hill_irish_rebellion_of_1804_australia.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Castle Hill convict rebellion](/wiki/Castle_Hill_convict_rebellion\n\"Castle Hill convict rebellion\") of 1804\n\nIn 1804 the [Castle Hill convict\nrebellion](/wiki/Castle_Hill_convict_rebellion \"Castle Hill convict\nrebellion\") was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it\nwas broken up quickly by the [New South Wales\nCorps](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Corps \"New South Wales Corps\"). On 26 January\n1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor\n[Bligh](/wiki/William_Bligh \"William Bligh\") led by [John\nMacarthur](/wiki/John_Macarthur_\\(wool_pioneer\\) \"John Macarthur \\(wool\npioneer\\)\"). Following this, Governor [Lachlan\nMacquarie](/wiki/Lachlan_Macquarie \"Lachlan Macquarie\") was given a mandate to\nrestore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he\nforcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\n\n  * **13 May 1787** – The 11 ships of the [First Fleet](/wiki/First_Fleet \"First Fleet\") leave Portsmouth under the command of Captain [Arthur Phillip](/wiki/Arthur_Phillip \"Arthur Phillip\"). Different accounts give varying numbers of passengers but the fleet consisted of at least 1,350 persons of whom 780 were convicts and 570 were free men, women and children and the number included four companies of marines. About 20% of the convicts were women and the oldest convict was 82. About 50% of the convicts had been tried in Middlesex and most of the rest were tried in the county assizes of Devon, Kent and Sussex\n  * **18 January 1788** – The First Fleet arrived in [Botany Bay](/wiki/Botany_Bay \"Botany Bay\") but the landing party was not impressed with the site, and moved the fleet to [Port Jackson](/wiki/Port_Jackson \"Port Jackson\"), landing in [Sydney Cove](/wiki/Sydney_Cove \"Sydney Cove\") on 26 January 1788 (now celebrated as [Australia Day](/wiki/Australia_Day \"Australia Day\"))\n  * **April 1789** – A suspicious outbreak of smallpox decimates local tribes.

The first settlement was made at [Risdon, Tasmania](/wiki/Risdon,_Tasmania \"Risdon, Tasmania\") on 11 September 1803 when Lieut John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site proved unsuitable and was abandoned in August 1804. Lieut-Col David Collins finally established a successful settlement at [Hobart](/wiki/Hobart \"Hobart\") in February 1804 with a party of about 260 people, including 178 convicts. (Collins had previously attempted a settlement in [Victoria](/wiki/Victoria_\\(Australia\\) \"Victoria \\(Australia\\)\").) Convict ships were sent from England directly to the colony from 1812 to 1853 and over the 50 years from 1803–1853 around 67,000 convicts were transported to Tasmania. About 14,492 were Irish but many of them had been sentenced in English and Scottish courts. Some were also tried locally in other Australian colonies. The _Indefatigable_ brought the first convicts direct from England on 19 October 1812 and by 1820 there were about 2,500 convicts in the colony. By the end of 1833 the number had increased to 14,900 convicts of whom 1864 were females. About 1,448 held [ticket of leave](/wiki/Ticket_of_leave#Australian_convicts \"Ticket of leave\"), 6,573 were assigned to settlers and 275 were recorded as \"absconded or missing\". In 1835 there were over 800 convicts working in chain-gangs at the penal station at [Port Arthur](/wiki/Port_Arthur,_Tasmania \"Port Arthur, Tasmania\") which operated from 1830 to 1877. Convicts were transferred to Van Diemen's Land from Sydney and, in later years, from 1841 to 1847, from Melbourne. Between 1826 and 1840, there were at least 19 ship loads of convicts sent from Van Diemen's Land to [Norfolk Island](/wiki/Norfolk_Island \"Norfolk Island\") and at other times they were sent from Norfolk Island to Van Diemen's Land.\n  * **21 January 1827** – Western Australia was established when a small British settlement was established at King George's Sound ([Albany](/wiki/Albany,_Western_Australia \"Albany, Western Australia\")) by Major Edmund Lockyer who was to provide a deterrent to the French presence in the area. On 18 June 1829 the new Swan River Colony was officially proclaimed with [Captain James Stirling](/wiki/Captain_James_Stirling \"Captain James Stirling\") as the first Governor. Except for the settlement at King George's Sound, the colony was never really a part of NSW. King George's Sound was handed over in 1831. In 1849 the colony was proclaimed a British penal settlement and the first convicts arrived in 1850. Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth, became the colony's convict settlement in 1838 and was used for local colonial offenders. Around 9,720 British convicts were sent directly to the colony in 43 ships between 1850 and 1868. The convicts were sought by local settlers because of the shortage of labour needed to develop the region. On 9 January 1868, Australia's last convict ship, the _Hougoumont_ brought its final cargo of 269 convicts. Convicts sent to Western Australia were sentenced to terms of 6, 7, 10, 14 and 15 years and some reports suggest that their literacy rate was around 75% as opposed to 50% for those sent to NSW and Tasmania. About a third of the convicts left the Swan River Colony after serving their time.\n  * **1835** – the _Proclamation of Governor Bourke_ , issued by the Colonial Office and sent to the Governor with Despatch 99 of 10 October 1835, implements the doctrine of _[terra nullius](/wiki/Terra_nullius \"Terra nullius\")_ upon which British settlement was based. Reinforcing the British assertion that the land belonged to no one prior to the British Crown taking possession of it, it effectively quashes pre-existing treaties with Aboriginal peoples (e.g. that signed by [John Batman](/wiki/John_Batman \"John Batman\")). Its publication in the Colony means that from then on, all people found occupying land without the authority of the government would be considered illegal trespassers. Aboriginal people therefore could not sell or assign the land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown.[22]\n  * **28 December 1836** – the British province of South Australia was established. In 1842 it became a crown colony and on 22 July 1861 its area was extended westwards to its present boundary and more area was taken from New South Wales. South Australia was never a British convict colony and between 1836–1840 about 13,400 immigrants arrived in the area. 24,900 more arrived between 1841–1850. Some escaped convicts did settle in the area and no doubt a number of ex-convicts moved there from other colonies. On 4 January 1837 Governor Hindmarsh proclaimed that any offenders convicted in South Australia, and being under sentence of transportation, were to be transported to either New South Wales or Van Diemens Land, by the first opportunity.[23]\n  * **1841** – [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\") is separated from New South Wales\n  * **1851** – [Victoria](/wiki/Victoria_\\(Australia\\) \"Victoria \\(Australia\\)\") is separated from New South Wales (formerly known as the Port Phillip District of NSW). Apart from castaways and runaway convicts in the 1790s, the first attempt at settlement was made on 13 October 1803 by Lieut. David Collins and his party of soldiers and convicts. Harsh conditions convinced him to abandon the settlement in January 1804. He moved on to Tasmania and it was not until the Henty brothers landed in Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned on 10 April 1837. The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839. Apart from those involved in early attempts at settlement in 1803 and 1826, the only convicts sent directly to Victoria from Britain were about 1,750 convicts known as the \"Exiles\" and they arrived between 1844–1849. They were sometimes called the \"Pentonvillians\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison in England. Many ex-convicts and convicts on Tickets of Leave and Conditional Pardons also moved to Port Phillip from Van Diemen's Land.\n  * **10 December 1859** – [Queensland](/wiki/Queensland \"Queensland\") is [separated from New South Wales](/wiki/Separation_of_Queensland \"Separation of Queensland\"). In 1824 the explorer Lieut. [John Oxley](/wiki/John_Oxley \"John Oxley\") took a party of 30 convicts and established a penal colony at Redcliffe. Known as the Moreton Bay Settlement, this later moved to the site now called Brisbane. The name Brisbane Town was in use by 1825 and the main inhabitants in the area were the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Station until it was closed in 1839. Around 2,280 convicts were sent to the settlement between 1824–1839 and at the end of 1836 the convict population numbered 337. The first free settlers moved to the district in 1838 and others followed in 1840.\n  * **23 December 1862** – the area of Queensland is increased.\n  * **1863** – control of the [Northern Territory](/wiki/Northern_Territory \"Northern Territory\") is granted to the Province (later State) of South Australia. In 1825 the area occupied today by Northern Territory was incorporated into the colony of New South Wales. It was first settled by Europeans in 1824 at Fort Dundas, [Port Essington](/wiki/Port_Essington \"Port Essington\"). Its capital city, [Darwin](/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory \"Darwin, Northern Territory\") was established in 1869 and was originally known as Palmerston. On 1 January 1911, the Northern Territory as we know it today was separated from South Australia and became part of the Commonwealth of Australia.\n  * **1 January 1901** – the [Federation of Australian States](/wiki/Federation_of_Australia \"Federation of Australia\") to form the [Commonwealth of Australia](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia \"Commonwealth of Australia\").\n  * **1911** – The [Federal Capital Territory](/wiki/History_of_the_Australian_Capital_Territory \"History of the Australian Capital Territory\") is established.\n\n[24]\n\n##\nExploration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Australia_\\(1788%E2%80%931850\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Exploration\")]\n\nMain article: [European exploration of\nAustralia](/wiki/European_exploration_of_Australia \"European exploration of\nAustralia\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Flinders01.jpg/170px-\nFlinders01.jpg)](/wiki/File:Flinders01.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Flinders01.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Matthew Flinders](/wiki/Matthew_Flinders \"Matthew Flinders\") led the first\nsuccessful circumnavigation of Australia in 1801–2.\n\nIn October 1795 [George Bass](/wiki/George_Bass \"George Bass\") and [Matthew\nFlinders](/wiki/Matthew_Flinders \"Matthew Flinders\"), accompanied by [William\nMartin](/wiki/Martin_Islet_\\(New_South_Wales\\)#William_Martin \"Martin Islet\n\\(New South Wales\\)\") sailed the boat _Tom Thumb_ out of [Port\nJackson](/wiki/Port_Jackson \"Port Jackson\") to [Botany Bay](/wiki/Botany_Bay\n\"Botany Bay\") and explored the [Georges River](/wiki/Georges_River \"Georges\nRiver\") further upstream than had been done previously by the colonists. Their\nreports on their return led to the settlement of [Banks'\nTown](/wiki/Bankstown,_New_South_Wales \"Bankstown, New South Wales\").[25] In\nMarch 1796 the same party embarked on a second voyage in a similar small boat,\nwhich they also called the Tom Thumb.[26] During this trip they travelled as\nfar down the coast as [Lake Illawarra](/wiki/Lake_Illawarra \"Lake Illawarra\"),\nwhich they called Tom Thumb Lagoon. They discovered and explored [Port\nHacking](/wiki/Port_Hacking \"Port Hacking\"). In 1798–99, Bass and Flinders set\nout in a sloop and circumnavigated [Van Diemen's Land](/wiki/Tasmania\n\"Tasmania\"), thus proving it to be an island.[27]\n\nAboriginal guides and assistance in the European exploration of the colony\nwere common and often vital to the success of missions. In 1801–02 Matthew\nFlinders in _The Investigator_ lead the first circumnavigation of Australia.\nAboard ship was the Aboriginal explorer [Bungaree](/wiki/Bungaree \"Bungaree\"),\nof the Sydney district, who became the first person born on the Australian\ncontinent to circumnavigate the Australian continent.[27] Previously, the\nfamous [Bennelong](/wiki/Bennelong \"Bennelong\") and a companion had become the\nfirst people born in the area of New South Wales to sail for Europe, when, in\n1792 they accompanied Governor Phillip to England and were presented to [King\nGeorge III](/wiki/King_George_III \"King George III\").[27]\n\nIn 1813, [Gregory Blaxland](/wiki/Gregory_Blaxland \"Gregory Blaxland\"),\n[William Lawson](/wiki/William_Lawson_\\(explorer\\) \"William Lawson\n\\(explorer\\)\") and [William Wentworth](/wiki/William_Wentworth \"William\nWentworth\") succeeded in crossing the formidable barrier of forested gulleys\nand sheer cliffs presented by the [Blue\nMountains](/wiki/Blue_Mountains_\\(New_South_Wales\\) \"Blue Mountains \\(New\nSouth Wales\\)\"), west of Sydney, by following the ridges instead of looking\nfor a route through the valleys. At [Mount Blaxland](/wiki/Mount_Blaxland\n\"Mount Blaxland\") they looked out over \"enough grass to support the stock of\nthe colony for thirty years\", and expansion of the British settlement into the\ninterior could begin.[28]\n\nIn 1824 the Governor [Sir Thomas Brisbane](/wiki/Thomas_Brisbane \"Thomas\nBrisbane\"), commissioned [Hamilton Hume](/wiki/Hamilton_Hume \"Hamilton Hume\")\nand former Royal Navy Captain [William Hovell](/wiki/William_Hovell \"William\nHovell\") to lead an expedition to find new grazing land in the south of the\ncolony, and also to find an answer to the mystery of where New South Wales's\nwestern rivers flowed. Over 16 weeks in 1824–25, [Hume and\nHovell](/wiki/Hume_and_Hovell_expedition \"Hume and Hovell expedition\")\njourneyed to Port Phillip and back. They made many important discoveries\nincluding the [Murray River](/wiki/Murray_River \"Murray River\") (which they\nnamed the Hume), many of its tributaries, and good agricultural and grazing\nlands between [Gunning, New South Wales](/wiki/Gunning,_New_South_Wales\n\"Gunning, New South Wales\") and [Corio Bay,\nVictoria](/w/index.php?title=Corio_Bay,_Victoria&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Corio\nBay, Victoria \\(page does not exist\\)\").[29]\n\n[Charles Sturt](/wiki/Charles_Sturt \"Charles Sturt\") led an expedition along\nthe [Macquarie River](/wiki/Macquarie_River \"Macquarie River\") in 1828 and\ndiscovered the [Darling River](/wiki/Darling_River \"Darling River\"). A theory\nhad developed that the inland rivers of New South Wales were draining into an\ninland sea. Leading a second expedition in 1829, Sturt followed the\n[Murrumbidgee River](/wiki/Murrumbidgee_River \"Murrumbidgee River\") into a\n'broad and noble river', the Murray River, which he named after Sir George\nMurray, secretary of state for the colonies. His party then followed this\nriver to its junction with the [Darling River](/wiki/Darling_River \"Darling\nRiver\"), facing two threatening encounters with local Aboriginal people along\nthe way. Sturt continued down river on to [Lake\nAlexandrina](/wiki/Lake_Alexandrina_\\(South_Australia\\) \"Lake Alexandrina\n\\(South Australia\\)\"), where the Murray meets the sea in South Australia.\nSuffering greatly, the party had to then row back upstream hundreds of\nkilometres for the return journey.[30]\n\nSurveyor General Sir [Thomas Mitchell](/wiki/Thomas_Mitchell_\\(explorer\\)\n\"Thomas Mitchell \\(explorer\\)\") conducted a series of expeditions from the\n1830s to 'fill in the gaps' left by these previous expeditions.

Agitation for representative government began soon\nafter the settlement of the colonies.[33]\n\nThe Second Fleet in 1790 brought to Sydney two men who were to play important\nroles in the colony's future. One was [D'Arcy\nWentworth](/wiki/D%27Arcy_Wentworth \"D'Arcy Wentworth\"), whose son, [William\nCharles](/wiki/William_Wentworth \"William Wentworth\"), went on to be an\nexplorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the\nmovement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative\ngovernment. The other was [John\nMacarthur](/wiki/John_Macarthur_\\(wool_pioneer\\) \"John Macarthur \\(wool\npioneer\\)\"), a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool\nindustry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity.\nMacarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the\n[Rum Rebellion](/wiki/Rum_Rebellion \"Rum Rebellion\") against the governor,\n[William Bligh](/wiki/William_Bligh \"William Bligh\").\n\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of [Lachlan\nMacquarie](/wiki/Lachlan_Macquarie \"Lachlan Macquarie\"), began to grow rapidly\nas free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the\nlong and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making\na new life on virtually free [Crown](/wiki/The_Crown \"The Crown\") land. From\nthe late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known\nas the [Nineteen Counties](/wiki/Nineteen_Counties \"Nineteen Counties\").\n\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised\nsettlement limits: they were known as [squatters](/wiki/Squatting_\\(pastoral\\)\n\"Squatting \\(pastoral\\)\") and became the basis of a powerful landowning class.\nAs a result of opposition from the [labouring](/wiki/Working_class \"Working\nclass\") and [artisan](/wiki/Artisan \"Artisan\") classes, transportation of\nconvicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller\ncolonies of [Van Diemen's Land](/wiki/Van_Diemen%27s_Land \"Van Diemen's Land\")\n(first settled in 1803, later renamed [Tasmania](/wiki/Tasmania \"Tasmania\"))\nand [Moreton Bay](/wiki/Moreton_Bay \"Moreton Bay\") (founded 1824, and later\nrenamed Queensland) for a few years more.\n\nThe [Swan River](/wiki/Swan_River_Colony \"Swan River Colony\") Settlement (as\nWestern Australia was originally known), centred on\n[Perth](/wiki/Perth,_Western_Australia \"Perth, Western Australia\"), was\nfounded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and\nby 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts.\n(Transportation did not end until 1868.) [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New\nZealand\") was part of [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South\nWales\") until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\n\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony\nwas governed by a British [Governor](/wiki/Governors_of_the_Australian_states\n\"Governors of the Australian states\"), appointed by the British monarch. There\nwas considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In\nmost cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the\nBritish military. The [New South Wales Corps](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Corps \"New\nSouth Wales Corps\"), which was in charge of [New South\nWales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South Wales\"), became known as the \"Rum\nCorps\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of [rum](/wiki/Rum \"Rum\"),\nwhich was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In [New South\nWales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South Wales\") this led to the \"[Rum\nRebellion](/wiki/Rum_Rebellion \"Rum Rebellion\")\". Although English law was\ntransplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [doctrine of\nreception](/wiki/Doctrine_of_reception \"Doctrine of reception\"), thus notions\nof the rights and processes established by the _[Magna\nCarta](/wiki/Magna_Carta \"Magna Carta\")_ and the [Bill of Rights\n1689](/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689 \"Bill of Rights 1689\") were brought from\nBritain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon\nafter the settlement of the colonies.[33]\n\nThe oldest legislative body in Australia, the [New South Wales Legislative\nCouncil](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council \"New South Wales\nLegislative Council\"), was created in 1825 as an appointed body to advise the\n[Governor of New South Wales](/wiki/Governor_of_New_South_Wales \"Governor of\nNew South Wales\"). [William Wentworth](/wiki/William_Wentworth \"William\nWentworth\") established the [Australian Patriotic\nAssociation](/wiki/Australian_Patriotic_Association \"Australian Patriotic\nAssociation\") (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand\n[democratic government](/wiki/Parliamentary_democracy \"Parliamentary\ndemocracy\") for New South Wales. The reformist [attorney\ngeneral](/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_South_Wales \"Attorney General of New\nSouth Wales\"), [John Plunkett](/wiki/John_Plunkett \"John Plunkett\"), sought to\napply [Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment \"Age of Enlightenment\")\nprinciples to governance in the colony, pursuing the establishment of equality\nbefore the law, first by extending jury rights to\n[emancipists](/wiki/Emancipist \"Emancipist\"), then by extending legal\nprotections to convicts, assigned servants and\n[Aborigines](/wiki/Indigenous_Australians \"Indigenous Australians\"). Plunkett\ntwice charged the colonist perpetrators of the [Myall Creek\nmassacre](/wiki/Myall_Creek_massacre \"Myall Creek massacre\") of Aborigines\nwith murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark _Church Act_ of 1836\n[disestablished](/wiki/State_religion \"State religion\") the [Church of\nEngland](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of England\") and established legal\nequality between [Anglicans](/wiki/Anglican_Church_of_Australia \"Anglican\nChurch of Australia\"), [Catholics](/wiki/Catholicism_in_Australia \"Catholicism\nin Australia\"), Presbyterians and later Methodists.[34]\n\nIn 1840, the [Adelaide City Council](/wiki/Adelaide_City_Council \"Adelaide\nCity Council\") and the [Sydney City Council](/wiki/Sydney_City_Council \"Sydney\nCity Council\") were established. Men who possessed 1000 pounds worth of\nproperty were able to stand for election and wealthy landowners were permitted\nup to four votes each in elections. Australia's first parliamentary elections\nwere conducted for the [New South Wales Legislative\nCouncil](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council \"New South Wales\nLegislative Council\") in 1843, again with voting rights (for males only) tied\nto property ownership or financial capacity. Voter rights were extended\nfurther in New South Wales in 1850 and elections for legislative councils were\nheld in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.[35]\n\nBy the mid-19th century, there was a strong desire for representative and\nresponsible government in the colonies of Australia, later fed by the\ndemocratic spirit of the [goldfields](/wiki/Australian_gold_rushes \"Australian\ngold rushes\") and the ideas of the great reform movements sweeping\n[Europe](/wiki/History_of_Europe \"History of Europe\"), the [United\nStates](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States \"History of the United States\") and\nthe [British Empire](/wiki/History_of_the_British_Empire \"History of the\nBritish Empire\"). The end of convict transportation accelerated reform in the\n1840s and 1850s. _The Australian Colonies Government Act_ [1850] was a\nlandmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South\nWales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies\nenthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically\nprogressive parliaments – though the constitutions generally maintained the\nrole of the colonial upper houses as representative of social and economic\n\"interests\" and all established [constitutional\nmonarchies](/wiki/Constitutional_Monarchy \"Constitutional Monarchy\") with the\n[British monarch](/wiki/British_monarch \"British monarch\") as the symbolic\nhead of state.[36]\n\n###\nTimeline[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Australia_\\(1788%E2%80%931850\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Timeline\")]\n\n  * 1788 – [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South Wales\"), according to Arthur Phillip's amended Commission dated 25 April 1787, includes \"all the islands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean\" and running westward to the [135th meridian east](/wiki/135th_meridian_east \"135th meridian east\").

As a British colony, the\npredominant Christian denomination was the [Church of\nEngland](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of England\"), but one-tenth of all\nthe convicts who came to Australia on the First Fleet were Catholic, and at\nleast half of them were born in Ireland.[37]\n\nA small proportion of British marines were also Catholic. Some of the Irish\nconvicts had been Transported to Australia for political crimes or social\nrebellion in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of the minority\nreligion for the first three decades of settlement.[38] It was therefore the\ncrew of the French explorer [La Pérouse](/wiki/Jean-\nFran%C3%A7ois_de_Galaup,_comte_de_La_P%C3%A9rouse \"Jean-François de Galaup,\ncomte de La Pérouse\") who conducted the first Catholic ceremony on Australian\nsoil in 1788 – the burial of Father [Louis Receveur](/wiki/Louis_Receveur\n\"Louis Receveur\"), a Franciscan monk, who died while the ships were at anchor\nat [Botany Bay](/wiki/Botany_Bay \"Botany Bay\"), while on a mission to explore\nthe Pacific.[39]\n\nIn early colonial times, Church of England clergy worked closely with the\n[governors](/wiki/Governors_of_New_South_Wales \"Governors of New South\nWales\").

Reaction to the affair in Britain led to two\nfurther priests being allowed to travel to the Colony in 1820 – [John Joseph\nTherry](/wiki/John_Joseph_Therry \"John Joseph Therry\") and [Philip\nConnolly](/wiki/Philip_Connolly \"Philip Connolly\").[38] The foundation stone\nfor the first [St Mary's Cathedral,\nSydney](/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Cathedral,_Sydney \"St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney\") was\nlaid on 29 October 1821 by Governor [Lachlan\nMacquarie](/wiki/Lachlan_Macquarie \"Lachlan Macquarie\").\n\nThe absence of a Catholic mission in Australia before 1818 reflected the legal\ndisabilities of Catholics in Britain and the difficult position of Ireland\nwithin the British Empire. The government therefore endorsed the English\n[Benedictines](/wiki/Benedictine \"Benedictine\") to lead the early Church in\nthe Colony.[43] The Church of England lost its legal privileges in the Colony\nof [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South Wales\") by the _Church\nAct of 1836_.

Establishing\nthemselves first at [Sevenhill](/wiki/Sevenhill \"Sevenhill\"), in South\nAustralia in 1848, the [Jesuits](/wiki/Jesuits \"Jesuits\") were the first\nreligious order of priests to enter and establish houses in South Australia,\nVictoria, [Queensland](/wiki/Queensland \"Queensland\") and the [Northern\nTerritory](/wiki/Northern_Territory \"Northern Territory\") – where they\nestablished schools and missions.\n\nSome Australian [folksongs](/wiki/Folk_music \"Folk music\") date to this\nperiod.\n\nAmong the first true works of [Australian\nliterature](/wiki/Australian_literature \"Australian literature\") produced over\nthis period was the accounts of the settlement of Sydney by [Watkin\nTench](/wiki/Watkin_Tench \"Watkin Tench\"), a captain of the marines on the\n[First Fleet](/wiki/First_Fleet \"First Fleet\") to arrive in 1788. In 1819,\npoet, explorer, journalist and politician [William\nWentworth](/wiki/William_Wentworth \"William Wentworth\") published the first\nbook written by an Australian: _A Statistical, Historical, and Political\nDescription of the Colony of New South Wales and Its Dependent Settlements in\nVan Diemen 's Land, With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which\nThese Colonies Offer for Emigration and Their Superiority in Many Respects\nOver Those Possessed by the United States of America_,[49] in which he\nadvocated an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and\nsettlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts. In 1838 _The\nGuardian: a tale_ by [Anna Maria Bunn](/wiki/Anna_Maria_Bunn \"Anna Maria\nBunn\") was published in Sydney. It was the first Australian novel printed and\npublished in mainland Australia and the first Australian novel written by a\nwoman. It is a [Gothic](/wiki/Gothic_fiction \"Gothic fiction\") romance.[50]\n\nEuropean traditions of [Australian theatre](/wiki/Australian_theatre\n\"Australian theatre\") also came with the [First Fleet](/wiki/First_Fleet\n\"First Fleet\"), with the first production being performed in 1789 by convicts\n: _[The Recruiting Officer](/wiki/The_Recruiting_Officer \"The Recruiting\nOfficer\")_ by [George Farquhar](/wiki/George_Farquhar \"George Farquhar\").[51]\nTwo centuries later, the extraordinary circumstances of the foundations of\nAustralian theatre were recounted in _[Our Country's\nGood](/wiki/Our_Country%27s_Good \"Our Country's Good\")_ by [Timberlake\nWertenbaker](/wiki/Timberlake_Wertenbaker \"Timberlake Wertenbaker\"): the\nparticipants were prisoners watched by sadistic guards and the leading lady\nwas under threat of the death penalty. The play is based on [Thomas\nKeneally](/wiki/Thomas_Keneally \"Thomas Keneally\")'s novel _[The\nPlaymaker](/wiki/The_Playmaker \"The Playmaker\")_.[51] The [Theatre Royal,\nHobart](/wiki/Theatre_Royal,_Hobart \"Theatre Royal, Hobart\"), opened in 1837\nand it remains the oldest theatre in Australia.[52] The [Melbourne\nAthenaeum](/wiki/Melbourne_Athenaeum \"Melbourne Athenaeum\") is one of the\noldest public institutions in Australia, founded in 1839 and it served as\nlibrary, school of arts and dance hall (and later became Australia's first\ncinema, screening _[The Story of the Kelly\nGang](/wiki/The_Story_of_the_Kelly_Gang \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\")_ , the\nworld's first feature film in 1906).[53] The [Queen's Theatre,\nAdelaide](/wiki/Queen%27s_Theatre,_Adelaide \"Queen's Theatre, Adelaide\")\nopened with [Shakespeare](/wiki/Shakespeare \"Shakespeare\") in 1841 and is\ntoday the oldest theatre on the mainland.[54]\n\n## Aboriginal\nresistance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Australia_\\(1788%E2%80%931850\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Aboriginal resistance\")]\n\nSee also: [Australian Frontier Wars](/wiki/Australian_Frontier_Wars\n\"Australian Frontier Wars\") and [History of Indigenous\nAustralians](/wiki/History_of_Indigenous_Australians \"History of Indigenous\nAustralians\")\n\n[Aboriginal](/wiki/Indigenous_Australians \"Indigenous Australians\") reactions\nto the sudden arrival of British settlers were varied, but often hostile when\nthe presence of the colonisers led to competition over resources, and to the\noccupation by the British of Aboriginal lands. European diseases decimated\nAboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food\nresources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the _[Treaty\nof Waitangi](/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi \"Treaty of Waitangi\")_ was seen to\nlegitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with Aborigines, who never\nauthorised British colonisation.\n\nAccording to the historian [Geoffrey Blainey](/wiki/Geoffrey_Blainey \"Geoffrey\nBlainey\"), in Australia during the colonial period:\n\n> \"In a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and\n> spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases\n> swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of\n> Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation\".[55]\n\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \"invasion\" to describe the British\ncolonisation of Australia has been [highly controversial](/wiki/History_wars\n\"History wars\"). According to Australian [Henry\nReynolds](/wiki/Henry_Reynolds_\\(historian\\) \"Henry Reynolds \\(historian\\)\")\nhowever, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \"invasion\" and \"warfare\" to\ndescribe their presence and relations with Indigenous Australians. In his book\n_[The Other Side of the Frontier](/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_the_Frontier \"The\nOther Side of the Frontier\")_ ,[56] Reynolds described in detail armed\nresistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of guerilla\nwarfare, beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early\ntwentieth.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Yagan_Statue_2005.jpg/170px-\nYagan_Statue_2005.jpg)](/wiki/File:Yagan_Statue_2005.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Yagan_Statue_2005.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStatue of [Yagan](/wiki/Yagan \"Yagan\") on [Heirisson\nIsland](/wiki/Heirisson_Island \"Heirisson Island\")\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in\nthe Sydney settlement, wrote of local Aborigines:\n\n> While they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their\n> residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle\n> they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity\n> and safety concurred.[57]\n\nIn 1847, Western Australian barrister E.W. Landor stated: \"We have seized upon\nthe country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it\nexpedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as [Julius\nCaesar](/wiki/Julius_Caesar \"Julius Caesar\") did when he [took possession of\nBritain](/wiki/Caesar%27s_invasions_of_Britain \"Caesar's invasions of\nBritain\").\"[58] In most cases, Reynolds says, Aborigines initially resisted\nBritish presence. In a letter to the _Launceston Advertiser_ in 1831, a\nsettler wrote:\n\n> We are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies – as invaders – as\n> oppressors and persecutors – they resist our invasion. They have never been\n> subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation,\n> defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn\n> from them by force.[59]\n\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the\nnineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror\ndue to attacks by Aborigines determined to kill them or drive them off their\nlands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least,\ntemporarily effective; the Aboriginal killings of men, sheep and cattle, and\nburning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal\nresistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in\n1881 the editor of _[The Queenslander](/wiki/The_Queenslander \"The\nQueenslander\")_ wrote:\n\n> During the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by\n> the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement\n> on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the\n> country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the\n> blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.[60]\n\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century\nbelies the \"myth\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often\nreacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous\nindiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.[61]\nAmong the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the\n[Pinjarra massacre](/wiki/Battle_of_Pinjarra \"Battle of Pinjarra\") and the\n[Myall Creek massacre](/wiki/Myall_Creek_massacre \"Myall Creek massacre\").\n\nFamous Aborigines who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and\nearly nineteenth centuries include [Pemulwuy](/wiki/Pemulwuy \"Pemulwuy\") and\n[Yagan](/wiki/Yagan \"Yagan\"). In [Tasmania](/wiki/Tasmania \"Tasmania\"), the\n\"[Black War](/wiki/Black_War \"Black War\")\" was fought in the first half of the\nnineteenth century.\n\n## Representations in literature and\nfilm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Australia_\\(1788%E2%80%931850\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Representations in literature and film\")]\n\n  * [Marcus Clarke](/wiki/Marcus_Clarke \"Marcus Clarke\")'s 1874 novel, _[For the Term of his Natural Life](/wiki/For_the_Term_of_his_Natural_Life \"For the Term of his Natural Life\")_ , and the 1983 television adaptation of the novel.\n  * [Eleanor Dark](/wiki/Eleanor_Dark \"Eleanor Dark\")'s 1947 Timeless Land trilogy, which spans the colonisation from 1788–1811.
