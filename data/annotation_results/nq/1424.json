        "# Abe Gubegna\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**Abe Gubegna** (1934-1980),[1] also spelled \"Abbé\" or \"Abbie\",\n([Amharic](/wiki/Amharic \"Amharic\"): አበ ጉበኛ) was an [Ethiopian](/wiki/Ethiopia\n\"Ethiopia\") novelist and playwright.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Life & work\n  * 2 Works in English\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n## Life & work[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Abe_Gubegna&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Life & work\")]\n\nHe was born in [Achefer, Yismala\nGiorgis](/w/index.php?title=Achefer,_Yismala_Giorgis&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Achefer, Yismala Giorgis \\(page does not exist\\)\") and attended the [local\nchurch](/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church \"Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo\nChurch\") schools where he became acquainted with [liturgical](/wiki/Liturgical\n\"Liturgical\") poetry and music. actually he didn't attend a university/ but he\nattended his seconadry school in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, he became a journalist\nand, later, a [civil servant](/wiki/Civil_servant \"Civil servant\"). He\neventually decided to devote all his time to writing, becoming Ethiopia's\nfirst full-time professional writer.[1] He was very outspoken on political\nissues and many of his books were banned. At one point, he was sentenced to\nthree years of forced confinement to a small area surrounding his home.\n\nDuring the \"Red Terror - White Terror\" days 1976 - 1979 he was one of the\noutspoken \"Apostles\" of change that nonetheless decried the blood shed others\nin the leftist movements believed were not only unavoidable but necessary. His\nvehemence against violence resulted in a newspaper article in which he\nsuggested those thirsty for blood may be better served drinking their wive's\nmenustral flow. Though this comment garnered him the ill-will of those who\nurged bloodshed and violence there is no indication that it led to anything\nmore than his being sidelined for his immodesty.\n\nHis most famous novel is _Aliwalidim_ (I Will Not Be Born, 1962), a satire\nabout a baby who refuses to emerge from his mother's womb because of the\nunjust world waiting outside.\n\nIn his later years, he participated in the _International Writing Fellowship\nProgram_ at the [University of Iowa](/wiki/University_of_Iowa \"University of\nIowa\").\n\nHe is credited with the following well-known quote (c.1974):\n\n    \"Every day in Africa a gazelle wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning a lion wakes up. It knows that it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death. It doesn’t matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle. When the sun comes up, you better be running.\"[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Works in\nEnglish[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Abe_Gubegna&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Works in English\")]\n\n  * _Defiance_ , Oxford University Press (1975) [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-19-572420-8](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-572420-8 \"Special:BookSources/0-19-572420-8\")\n  * _The Savage Girl_ , Berhanena Selam (1964)\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Abe_Gubegna&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Oxford University Press, brief biography from \"Defiance\"\n\n## External links[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Abe_Gubegna&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: External links\")]\n\n  * [Saturday Monitor: Banning book could be a blessing in disguise](http://www.monitor.co.ug/OpEd/Commentary/-/689364/1033088/-/13umqt0z/-/index.html)\n\n[Authority control](/wiki/Help:Authority_control \"Help:Authority control\") | \n\n  * [WorldCat Identities](https://www.worldcat.org/identities/containsVIAFID/163851822)\n  * [VIAF](/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File \"Virtual International Authority File\"): [163851822](https://viaf.org/viaf/163851822)\n  * [LCCN](/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number \"Library of Congress Control Number\"): [no96026324](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no96026324)\n  * [SUDOC](/wiki/Syst%C3%A8me_universitaire_de_documentation \"Système universitaire de documentation\"): [073384941](https://www.idref.fr/073384941)\n  * [IATH](/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Technology_in_the_Humanities \"Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities\"): [w64n13p6](http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w64n13p6)\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \n![](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1)\n\nRetrieved from\n\"[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abe_Gubegna&oldid=785298123](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abe_Gubegna&oldid=785298123)\"\n\n[Categories](/wiki/Help:Category \"Help:Category\"):\n\n  * [1934 births](/wiki/Category:1934_births \"Category:1934 births\")\n  * [1980 deaths](/wiki/Category:1980_deaths \"Category:1980 deaths\")\n  * [Ethiopian journalists](/wiki/Category:Ethiopian_journalists \"Category:Ethiopian journalists\")\n  * [Ethiopian novelists](/wiki/Category:Ethiopian_novelists \"Category:Ethiopian novelists\")\n  * [Ethiopian dramatists and playwrights](/wiki/Category:Ethiopian_dramatists_and_playwrights \"Category:Ethiopian dramatists and playwrights\")\n  * [20th-century novelists](/wiki/Category:20th-century_novelists \"Category:20th-century novelists\")\n\nHidden categories:\n\n  * [All articles with unsourced statements](/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements \"Category:All articles with unsourced statements\")\n  * [Articles with unsourced statements from May 2013](/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_May_2013 \"Category:Articles with unsourced statements from May 2013\")\n  * [Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers](/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers \"Category:Wikipedia articles with VIAF identifiers\")\n  * [Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers](/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers \"Category:Wikipedia articles with LCCN identifiers\")\n  * [Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers](/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_SNAC-ID_identifiers \"Category:Wikipedia articles with SNAC-ID identifiers\")\n  * [Articles created via the Article Wizard](/wiki/Category:Articles_created_via_the_Article_Wizard \"Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard\")\n\n## Navigation menu\n\n### Personal tools\n\n  * Not logged in\n  * [Talk](/wiki/Special:MyTalk \"Discussion about edits from this IP address \\[ctrl-alt-n\\]\")\n  * [Contributions](/wiki/Special:MyContributions \"A list of edits made from this IP address \\[ctrl-alt-y\\]\")\n  * [Create account](/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Abe+Gubegna \"You are encouraged to create an account and log in;
