These lotteries occurred during a period of\n[conscription](/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States \"Conscription in the\nUnited States\") from just before [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War\nII\") to 1973.\n\nThe lottery numbers assigned in December 1969 were used during calendar year\n1970 both to call for induction and to call for physical examination, a\npreliminary call covering more men.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Method\n  * 2 Origins and consequences\n  * 3 Modification\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n##\nMethod[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Draft_lottery_\\(1969\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Method\")]\n\nThe days of the year (including [February 29](/wiki/Leap_day \"Leap day\")) were\nwritten on slips of paper. These pieces of paper were then placed in separate\nplastic capsules that were mixed in a shoebox and then dumped into a deep\nglass jar. Capsules were drawn from the jar one at a time.\n\nThe first number drawn was 258 (September 14), so all registrants with that\nbirthday were assigned lottery number 1. The second number drawn corresponded\nto April 24, and so forth. All men of draft age (born 1944 to 1950) who shared\na birth date would be called to serve at once. The first 195 birthdates drawn\nwere later called to serve in the order they were drawn; the last of these was\nSeptember 24.[1]\n\nAlso on December 1, 1969, a second lottery was held with the 26 letters of the\nalphabet. Among men with the same birthdate, the order of induction was\ndetermined by the ranks of the first letters of their last, first, and middle\nnames.[2] Anyone with initials \"JJJ\" would have been first within the shared\nbirthdate, followed by \"JGJ\", \"JDJ\", and \"JXJ\"; anyone with initials \"VVV\"\nwould have been last.[3]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/1969_draft_lottery_scatterplot.svg/440px-1969_draft_lottery_scatterplot.svg.png)](/wiki/File:1969_draft_lottery_scatterplot.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1969_draft_lottery_scatterplot.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSSS Draft [scatterplot](/wiki/Scatterplot \"Scatterplot\") of the days of the\nyear (horizontal) and their lottery numbers (vertical). December birthdays\n(far right) were assigned many low numbers (bottom), representing early\ninduction, and few high numbers (top).\n\nPeople soon noticed that the lottery numbers were not distributed uniformly\nover the year. In particular, November and December births, or dates 306 to\n366, were assigned mainly to lower draft numbers representing earlier calls to\nserve (see figure). This led to complaints that the lottery was not random as\nthe legislation required. Analysis of the procedure suggested that mixing 366\ncapsules in the shoe box did not mix them sufficiently before dumping them\ninto the jar. (\"The capsules were put in a box month by month, January through\nDecember, and subsequent mixing efforts were insufficient to overcome this\nsequencing.\")[2] Only five days in December—Dec. 2, 12, 15, 17 and 19—were\nhigher than the last call number of 195; had the days been evenly distributed,\n14 days in December would have been expected to remain uncalled. From January\nto December, the rank of the average draft pick numbers were 5 4 1 3 2 6 8 9\n10 7 11 12. A [Monte Carlo simulation](/wiki/Monte_Carlo_simulation \"Monte\nCarlo simulation\") found that the probability of a random order of months\nbeing this close to the 1–12 sequence expected for unsorted slips was\n0.09%.[4]\n\nDraft lotteries were conducted again in 1970 (for those born in 1951) and from\n1971 to 1975 (for 1952 to 1956 births). The draft numbers issued in 1972 were\nnever used the next year to call for induction into service, because the last\ncall was December 7 and authority to induct expired on June 30, 1973.\n\nThe 1972 to 1975 lottery numbers were used to call some men born 1953 to 1956\nfor physical exams. The highest number called for a physical was 215 (for\ntables 1970 through 1976).[3]\n\n## Origins and\nconsequences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Draft_lottery_\\(1969\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Origins and consequences\")]\n\nPreviously in the United States, during the [War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812\n\"War of 1812\"), [President Madison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\")\nestablished a commission to recommend the best ways to raise military\nmanpower; to keep the draft or to institute a [volunteer\narmy](/wiki/Volunteer_military \"Volunteer military\").[5]\n\nAfter much debate within the Nixon administration and Congress, it was decided\nthat an all-volunteer force was affordable, feasible, and would enhance the\nnation’s security.[6] President Richard Nixon issued an [executive\norder](/wiki/Executive_order \"Executive order\") prescribing regulations for\nrandom selection by the United States Selective Service on November 26,\n1969.[7]\n\nThe 1970s were a time of turmoil in the United States, beginning with the\nCivil Rights Movement which set the standards for practices by the anti-war\nmovement. The 1969 draft lottery only encouraged resentment of the Vietnam war\nand the draft. It strengthened the [anti-war movement](/wiki/Anti-war_movement\n\"Anti-war movement\"),[_[verification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_] and all over the United States people decried\ndiscrimination by the draft system \"against low-education, low-income,\nunderprivileged members of society\".[8]\n\nThe draft lottery had social and economic consequences because it generated\nresistance to military service and the resisters, draft evaders or \"[draft\ndodgers](/wiki/Draft_dodgers \"Draft dodgers\")\", were generally young, well-\neducated, healthy men. The fear of military service in Vietnam influenced many\nyoung men born in the late 1940s to join the National Guard. These young men\nwere aware that the National Guard would be unlikely to send its soldiers to\nVietnam. Many men were unable to join the National Guard, even though they had\npassed their physicals, because many state National Guards had long waiting\nlists just to enlist. Still others chose legal sanctions such as imprisonment,\neither showing their disapproval by burning their draft cards or draft\nletters, or simply not presenting themselves for the military service test.\nOthers left the country, commonly moving to Canada. The number of American\ncitizens who moved to Canada during the Vietnam war because of the draft is\nestimated to be around 125,000; it is believed that about half returned to the\nUnited States after the Nixon era (when the war was also\nover)(1975).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n##\nModification[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Draft_lottery_\\(1969\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Modification\")]\n\nLottery procedure was improved the next year although public discontent\ncontinued to grow[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] until \"authority to induct expired on June 30,\n1973\".[3]\n\nIn 1970, covering 1951 birthdates for use during 1971 (sometimes called the\n1971 draft), scientists at the [National Bureau of\nStandards](/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Standards \"National Bureau of Standards\")\nprepared 78 random permutations of the numbers 1 to 366 using random numbers\nselected from published tables.[9] From the 78 permutations, 25 were selected\nat random and transcribed to calendars using 1 = January 1, 2 = January 2, ...\n365 = December 31. Those calendars were sealed in envelopes. 25 more\npermutations were selected and sealed in 25 more envelopes without\ntranscription to calendars. The two sets of 25 envelopes were furnished to the\nSelective Service System.[9]\n\nOn June 2, an official picked two envelopes, thus one calendar and one raw\npermutation. The 365 birthdates (for 1951) were written down, placed in\ncapsules, and put in a drum in the order dictated by the selected calendar.\nSimilarly, the numbers from 1 to 365 were written down and placed into\ncapsules in the order dictated by the raw permutation.[9]\n\nOn July 1, the drawing date, one drum was rotated for an hour and the other\nfor a half-hour (its rotating mechanism failed).[9] Pairs of capsules were\nthen drawn, one from each drum, one with a 1951 birthdate and one with a\nnumber 1 to 366. The first date and number drawn were September 16 and 139, so\nall men born September 16, 1951, were assigned draft number 139. The 11th\ndraws were the date July 9 and the number 1, so men born July 9 were assigned\ndraft number 1 and drafted first.[9]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Draft_lottery_\\(1969\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Selective Service System.
