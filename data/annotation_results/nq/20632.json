It is [the second\nfilm](/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films \"List of Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse films\") in the [Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse](/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\") (MCU).\nThe film was directed by [Louis Leterrier](/wiki/Louis_Leterrier \"Louis\nLeterrier\"), with a screenplay by [Zak Penn](/wiki/Zak_Penn \"Zak Penn\"). It\nstars [Edward Norton](/wiki/Edward_Norton \"Edward Norton\"), [Liv\nTyler](/wiki/Liv_Tyler \"Liv Tyler\"), [Tim Roth](/wiki/Tim_Roth \"Tim Roth\"),\n[Tim Blake Nelson](/wiki/Tim_Blake_Nelson \"Tim Blake Nelson\"), [Ty\nBurrell](/wiki/Ty_Burrell \"Ty Burrell\"), and [William Hurt](/wiki/William_Hurt\n\"William Hurt\"). In _The Incredible Hulk_ , Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as\nan unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the\n[supersoldier](/wiki/Supersoldier \"Supersoldier\") program through gamma\nradiation. On the run, he attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he is\ncaptured by General [Thaddeus Ross](/wiki/Thunderbolt_Ross \"Thunderbolt\nRoss\"), but his worst fears are realized when power-hungry soldier [Emil\nBlonsky](/wiki/Abomination_\\(comics\\) \"Abomination \\(comics\\)\") becomes a\nsimilar, but more bestial creature.\n\nAfter the mixed reception to the 2003 film _[Hulk](/wiki/Hulk_\\(film\\) \"Hulk\n\\(film\\)\")_ , Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character.\nLeterrier, who had expressed interest in directing _[Iron\nMan](/wiki/Iron_Man_\\(2008_film\\) \"Iron Man \\(2008 film\\)\")_ , was brought\nonboard and Penn began work on a [loose sequel](/wiki/Sequel#Stand-\nalone_sequels \"Sequel\") that would be much closer to the comics and the [1978\ntelevision series of the same\nname](/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(1978_TV_series\\) \"The Incredible Hulk \\(1978\nTV series\\)\"). In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to\nrewrite Penn's screenplay in order to distance itself from the 2003 film and\nestablish its own identity, although he would go uncredited for his writing.\nFilming mostly took place in [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\"),\n[Ontario](/wiki/Ontario \"Ontario\"), from July to November 2007. Over 700\nvisual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of\n[motion capture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion capture\") and [computer-\ngenerated imagery](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-generated\nimagery\") to complete the film.\n\n_The Incredible Hulk_ premiered on June 8, 2008 at the [Gibson\nAmphitheatre](/wiki/Gibson_Amphitheatre \"Gibson Amphitheatre\") in [Universal\nCity, California](/wiki/Universal_City,_California \"Universal City,\nCalifornia\") and was released in theaters on June 13, 2008, receiving\ngenerally favorable reviews by critics upon release. Critical praise went to\nthe improved visuals, action sequences, and the portrayal of the title\ncharacter. The film was number one at the [box office](/wiki/Box_office \"Box\noffice\"), grossing over $263 million worldwide. Norton was set to reprise the\nrole of Banner in _[The Avengers](/wiki/The_Avengers_\\(2012_film\\) \"The\nAvengers \\(2012 film\\)\")_ and any other MCU installment featuring the\ncharacter, but he was ultimately replaced by [Mark Ruffalo](/wiki/Mark_Ruffalo\n\"Mark Ruffalo\"), who has signed on to portray the character in all potential\nsequels.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Development\n    * 3.2 Pre-production\n    * 3.3 Filming\n    * 3.4 Post-production\n  * 4 Music\n  * 5 Release\n    * 5.1 Editing\n    * 5.2 Marketing\n    * 5.3 Home media\n  * 6 Reception\n    * 6.1 Box office\n      * 6.1.1 North America\n      * 6.1.2 Outside North America\n    * 6.2 Critical response\n  * 7 Future\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nAt Culver University in Virginia, General [Thunderbolt\nRoss](/wiki/Thunderbolt_Ross \"Thunderbolt Ross\") meets with Dr. [Bruce\nBanner](/wiki/Bruce_Banner \"Bruce Banner\"), the colleague and boyfriend of his\ndaughter [Betty](/wiki/Betty_Ross \"Betty Ross\"), regarding an experiment that\nRoss claims is meant to make humans immune to [gamma\nradiation](/wiki/Gamma_radiation \"Gamma radiation\"). The experiment — part of\na [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") era \"super soldier\"\nprogram that Ross hopes to recreate — fails, and the exposure to gamma\nradiation causes Banner to transform into the [Hulk](/wiki/Hulk_\\(comics\\)\n\"Hulk \\(comics\\)\") for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises\nabove 200. The Hulk destroys the lab and injures or kills the people inside.\nBanner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who\nwants to weaponize the Hulk process.\n\nFive years later,[N 1] Banner works at a bottling factory in\n[Rocinha](/wiki/Rocinha \"Rocinha\"), [Rio de Janeiro](/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro \"Rio\nde Janeiro\") in Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the\nInternet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as \"Mr. Blue\", and to\nwhom he is \"Mr. Green\". He is also learning [Yoga](/wiki/Yoga \"Yoga\")\ntechniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After\nBanner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is\neventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [Milwaukee,\nWisconsin](/wiki/Milwaukee,_Wisconsin \"Milwaukee, Wisconsin\"), giving him\ngamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special\nforces team, led by Russian-born British [Royal Marine](/wiki/Royal_Marine\n\"Royal Marine\") [Emil Blonsky](/wiki/Abomination_\\(comics\\) \"Abomination\n\\(comics\\)\"), to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats\nBlonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees\nto be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him\nenhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his\nskeleton and impair his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, who is dating\npsychiatrist [Leonard Samson](/wiki/Doc_Samson \"Doc Samson\"). Banner is\nattacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the\nsuspicious Samson, causing him to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing\nbattle outside the university proves to be futile for Ross' forces and they\neventually retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is starting to falter, boldly\nattacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with\nBetty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and\nBanner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr.\nBlue is actually cellular biologist Dr. [Samuel\nSterns](/wiki/Leader_\\(comics\\) \"Leader \\(comics\\)\"), who tells Banner he has\ndeveloped a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test,\nhe warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual\ntransformation. Sterns reveals he has [synthesized](/wiki/Organic_synthesis\n\"Organic synthesis\") Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil,\ninto a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\"\nto medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands,\nBanner wishes to destroy the blood supply.\n\nMeanwhile, Blonsky is revealed to have survived the earlier battle at Culver\nUniversity and has completely healed. He joins Ross' forces for a third\nattempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner, along with\nBetty, are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns\nto inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. Sterns warns\nthat the combination of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause\nhim to become an \"abomination\", but Blonsky insists. The experiment mutates\nBlonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk,\nbut drives him mad. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a\ncut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. Blonsky then\nrampages through [Harlem](/wiki/Harlem \"Harlem\"). Realizing that the Hulk is\nthe only one who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He\njumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a\nlong and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky. After having\na small, peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees from New York.\n\nA month later, Banner is in [Bella Coola, British\nColumbia](/wiki/Bella_Coola,_British_Columbia \"Bella Coola, British\nColumbia\"). Instead of trying to suppress his transformation, he successfully\ntransforms in a controlled manner. In a final scene, [Tony\nStark](/wiki/Iron_Man \"Iron Man\") approaches Ross at a local bar and informs\nhim [a team](/wiki/The_Avengers_\\(2012_film\\) \"The Avengers \\(2012 film\\)\") is\nbeing put together.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Edward Norton](/wiki/Edward_Norton \"Edward Norton\") as [Bruce Banner / Hulk](/wiki/Hulk_\\(comics\\) \"Hulk \\(comics\\)\"):  \nA [nuclear physicist](/wiki/Nuclear_physics \"Nuclear physics\") and\n[biochemist](/wiki/Biochemist \"Biochemist\") at Culver University who, because\nof exposure to [gamma radiation](/wiki/Gamma_radiation \"Gamma radiation\"),\ntransforms into an enormous green humanoid monster when enraged or agitated.\n[David Duchovny](/wiki/David_Duchovny \"David Duchovny\") was a front-runner for\nthe film before Norton's casting,[7] while Louis Leterrier's original choice\nfor the role was [Mark Ruffalo](/wiki/Mark_Ruffalo \"Mark Ruffalo\"), who would\nlater play Banner in the [Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse](/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\").[8]\n[Gale Anne Hurd](/wiki/Gale_Anne_Hurd \"Gale Anne Hurd\") recalled Norton's\nportrayals of duality in _[Primal Fear](/wiki/Primal_Fear_\\(film\\) \"Primal\nFear \\(film\\)\")_ and _[Fight Club](/wiki/Fight_Club \"Fight Club\")_ ,[9] while\nNorton reminded [Kevin Feige](/wiki/Kevin_Feige \"Kevin Feige\") of [Bill\nBixby](/wiki/Bill_Bixby \"Bill Bixby\"), who played Banner in the [TV\nseries](/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(1978_TV_series\\) \"The Incredible Hulk\n\\(1978 TV series\\)\").[10] Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby,\nremarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".[11]\nNorton was a _Hulk_ fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV\nshow, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the\ncharacter.[12] He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.[13]\nHe initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or\nthe defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that\nwould be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that\nwas familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met\nLeterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to\nhim to guide the project. Thus, Norton rewrote the script.[14] \"Edward's\nscript has given Bruce's story real gravitas,\" Leterrier said. \"Admittedly I'm\nnot the most adult director, but just because we're making a superhero movie\nit doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see\nsuperheroes as the new [Greek gods](/wiki/Greek_pantheon \"Greek\npantheon\").\"[15] Additionally, [Lou Ferrigno](/wiki/Lou_Ferrigno \"Lou\nFerrigno\") provides vocal performance as the Hulk. During the 2008 [New York\nComic Con](/wiki/New_York_Comic_Con \"New York Comic Con\") Leterrier publicly\noffered Ferrigno the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.[16] This marks the\nthird time Ferrigno portrayed the Hulk, having also voiced the character in\nthe [1996 animated series](/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(1996_TV_series\\) \"The\nIncredible Hulk \\(1996 TV series\\)\"). Originally, the Hulk's only line was\n\"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word. Leterrier\nwas aware that fans wanted him to speak normally, and added \"leave me alone\"\nand \"Hulk smash!\" The latter line received cheers during a screening he\nattended.[17] Ferrigno also has a cameo in the film as a security guard who is\nbribed by Banner with a pizza.[18]\n\n  * [Liv Tyler](/wiki/Liv_Tyler \"Liv Tyler\") as [Betty Ross](/wiki/Betty_Ross \"Betty Ross\"):  \nA [cellular biologist](/wiki/Cellular_biology \"Cellular biology\") and Bruce's\ngirlfriend, from whom he is separated as a result of his condition. Tyler was\nattracted to the love story in the script, and was a fan of the TV show,\nbecause of the \"humanity and what [Banner] is going through\".[12] She was\ncalled about the role while driving to her home, and she accepted the part\nafter a day without reading the script.[19] Tyler and Norton spent hours\ndiscussing Bruce and Betty's life before he became the Hulk.[20] She said\nfilming the part \"was very physical, which was fun\",[21] and compared her\nperformance to \"a deer caught in the headlights\", because of Betty's shock at\nBruce's unexpected return into her life.[20]\n\n  * [Tim Roth](/wiki/Tim_Roth \"Tim Roth\") as [Emil Blonsky / Abomination](/wiki/Abomination_\\(comics\\) \"Abomination \\(comics\\)\"):  \nA Russian-born officer in the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United\nKingdom\")'s [Royal Marines Commandos](/wiki/Royal_Marines_Commandos \"Royal\nMarines Commandos\") loaned to Ross who, lusting for the Hulk's power, is\ninjected with various serums that transforms him into a near-skeletal humanoid\nmonster more powerful than the Hulk himself. Roth said he took the part to\nplease his sons, who are comic-book superhero fans. As a teenager, Roth was a\nfan of the 1970s TV series, and he also found Leterrier's ideas \"very dark and\nvery interesting\". Roth started watching the 2003 film to prepare for the\npart, but stopped as he did not want to be caught up in the controversy over\nits quality, and to compare himself to it.[22] It was Roth who suggested\nBlonsky be a soldier, whereas in the comics he was a [KGB](/wiki/KGB \"KGB\")\nagent.[23] Leterrier was a fan of Roth's work, and felt \"it's great watching a\nnormal [Cockney](/wiki/Cockney \"Cockney\") boy become a superhero!\",[15] but\nMarvel and Norton were initially reluctant to cast him.[24] Before he was cast\nin _[Punisher: War Zone](/wiki/Punisher:_War_Zone \"Punisher: War Zone\")_ ,\n[Ray Stevenson](/wiki/Ray_Stevenson_\\(actor\\) \"Ray Stevenson \\(actor\\)\") was\nin discussions for the role.[25] Roth prepared for the part by learning to\nfire guns and break into rooms with two experts.[23] Roth found it tough\nshooting the chases, because to show Blonsky's aging he could not work\nout.[20] He especially found it difficult to run while pulled with a harness,\nwhich was used to show the injected Blonsky's 30–40 mile per hour running\nabilities.[26] [Cyril Raffaelli](/wiki/Cyril_Raffaelli \"Cyril Raffaelli\")\nperformed some of Roth's stunts.[9] Roth enjoyed the [motion\ncapture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion capture\"), which reminded him of [fringe\ntheatre](/wiki/Fringe_theatre \"Fringe theatre\"), and he hired his trainer from\n_[Planet of the Apes](/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_\\(2001_film\\) \"Planet of the\nApes \\(2001 film\\)\")_ to aid him in portraying the monster's movement.[20]\n\n  * [Tim Blake Nelson](/wiki/Tim_Blake_Nelson \"Tim Blake Nelson\") as [Samuel Sterns](/wiki/Leader_\\(comics\\) \"Leader \\(comics\\)\"): The cellular biologist who develops a possible antidote to Banner's condition. Towards the end of the film, Sterns is exposed to some substance that begins his transformation into [Leader](/wiki/Leader_\\(comics\\) \"Leader \\(comics\\)\").\n  * [Ty Burrell](/wiki/Ty_Burrell \"Ty Burrell\") as [Leonard Samson](/wiki/Doc_Samson \"Doc Samson\"):  \nA psychiatrist in a relationship with Betty during Bruce's absence. Burrell\nhad performed with Norton in the [off Broadway](/wiki/Off_Broadway \"Off\nBroadway\") play _[Burn This](/wiki/Burn_This \"Burn This\")_ in 2003, and when\nLeterrier met him, he recognized Burrell as the \"jerk\" from the 2004 _[Dawn of\nthe Dead](/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Dead_\\(2004_film\\) \"Dawn of the Dead \\(2004\nfilm\\)\")_ remake,[27] which was how Samson was characterized in the script\nbefore Norton's rewrote it.[28]\n\n  * [William Hurt](/wiki/William_Hurt \"William Hurt\") as [Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross](/wiki/Thunderbolt_Ross \"Thunderbolt Ross\"):  \nBetty's arrogant father, who has dedicated himself to capturing the Hulk.\nLeterrier cast Hurt because \"Ross is more physical, more explosive in this\nmovie, and no actor goes from zero to 100 as well as William.\"[15] He compared\nRoss to [Captain Ahab](/wiki/Ahab_\\(Moby-Dick\\) \"Ahab \\(Moby-Dick\\)\").[24] The\nHulk is Hurt's favorite superhero, and his son is also a big fan of the\ncharacter. Hurt found production very different from the typical \"pure\nanxiety\" of a studio film, finding it more akin to an independent film.[29] He\ndescribed Ross as \"humiliated by Hulk's conscience: he actually sees and\nrecognizes that it's more developed than his own, even though he's a patriot\nand a warrior for his country. He's sacrificed [much] for that purpose, but at\nthe expense at times of his humanity – which he occasionally recovers.\"[30] In\nJune 2015, when reflecting on how his reprisal in _[Captain America: Civil\nWar](/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War \"Captain America: Civil War\")_ was\ndifferent from this film, Hurt said, \"What I created [for _The Incredible\nHulk_] was a Ross who was right out of the graphic novel type of thing, where\nhe was as much of a cartoon, in a way, as the monsters were. His ego was just\nas big and his problems were just as big. I really did do that consciously. I\ncreated a General Ross before which created a verisimilitude for the monsters,\nby making him a human monster. I worked really hard on the makeup and the\nexaggerated behavior and things like that and a controlled psychosis.\"[31]\n[Sam Elliott](/wiki/Sam_Elliott \"Sam Elliott\") had expressed interest in\nreprising the role from the first _Hulk_ film.[32]\n\n[Robert Downey, Jr.](/wiki/Robert_Downey,_Jr. \"Robert Downey, Jr.\") has an\nuncredited cameo as Tony Stark at the end of the film. Downey appeared as a\nfavor to [Marvel Studios](/wiki/Marvel_Studios \"Marvel Studios\"), which he\nacknowledged as a smart move on Marvel's part, because when he was promoting\nhis film he would also have to mention their other production.[33] Hulk co-\ncreator [Stan Lee](/wiki/Stan_Lee \"Stan Lee\") cameos as a man who becomes ill\nwhen drinking the soda poisoned by Banner's blood. [Michael K.\nWilliams](/wiki/Michael_K._Williams \"Michael K. Williams\") appears as a Harlem\nbystander, a role that was written for him by Norton, who is a fan of _[The\nWire](/wiki/The_Wire_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Wire \\(TV series\\)\")_.[34] [Paul\nSoles](/wiki/Paul_Soles \"Paul Soles\"), who voiced Banner in the 1966 _[The\nMarvel Superheroes](/wiki/The_Marvel_Superheroes \"The Marvel Superheroes\")_\ncartoon, appears as Stanley, a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner.\nAdditionally, the late [Bill Bixby](/wiki/Bill_Bixby \"Bill Bixby\") appears, in\na scene on his TV comedy-drama _[The Courtship of Eddie's\nFather](/wiki/The_Courtship_of_Eddie%27s_Father \"The Courtship of Eddie's\nFather\")_ on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film.\n[Rickson Gracie](/wiki/Rickson_Gracie \"Rickson Gracie\") has a small role as\nBruce Banner's martial arts instructor, despite his [Brazilian Jiu-\nJitsu](/wiki/Brazilian_Jiu-Jitsu \"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu\") background, he is\ncredited as an [Aikido](/wiki/Aikido \"Aikido\") instructor. [Peter\nMensah](/wiki/Peter_Mensah \"Peter Mensah\") plays a small role as General Joe\nGellar, one of General Ross' military friends/associates. [Martin\nStarr](/wiki/Martin_Starr \"Martin Starr\") plays a college student, credited as\n\"Computer Nerd\" and identified as [Amadeus Cho](/wiki/Amadeus_Cho \"Amadeus\nCho\") in the novelization for the film.[35] Hulk supporting characters, [Jim\nWilson](/wiki/Jim_Wilson_\\(comics\\) \"Jim Wilson \\(comics\\)\") and [Jack\nMcGee](/wiki/Jack_McGee_\\(Marvel\\) \"Jack McGee \\(Marvel\\)\"), make cameo\nappearances as Culver University students played by P.J.

Above\nis Edward Norton, and below is Bill Bixby, both sitting in a similar machine.\n\nAt the time of the release of [Ang Lee](/wiki/Ang_Lee \"Ang Lee\")'s\n_[Hulk](/wiki/Hulk_\\(film\\) \"Hulk \\(film\\)\")_ , screenwriter [James\nSchamus](/wiki/James_Schamus \"James Schamus\") was planning a sequel, featuring\nthe Grey Hulk. He was also considering the Leader and the Abomination as\nvillains.[37] Marvel wanted the Abomination because he would be an actual\nthreat to the Hulk, unlike General Ross.[38] During the filming of _Hulk_ ,\nproducer Avi Arad had a target May 2005 theatrical release date.[39] On\nJanuary 18, 2006 Arad confirmed Marvel Studios would be providing the money\nfor _The Incredible Hulk_ 's production budget, with Universal\ndistributing,[40] because Universal did not meet the deadline for filming a\nsequel.[7] Marvel felt it would be better to deviate from Ang Lee's style to\ncontinue the franchise, arguing his film was like a [parallel\nuniverse](/wiki/Parallel_universe_\\(fiction\\) \"Parallel universe \\(fiction\\)\")\n[one-shot](/wiki/One-shot_\\(comics\\) \"One-shot \\(comics\\)\") comic book, and\ntheir next film needed to be, in Kevin Feige's words, \"_really_ starting the\nMarvel Hulk franchise\". Producer Gale Anne Hurd also felt the film had to meet\nwhat \"everyone expects to see from having read the comics and seen the TV\nseries\".[20]\n\n### Pre-\nproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Pre-production\")]\n\nLouis Leterrier, who enjoyed the TV series as a child and liked the first\nfilm,[9][20] had expressed interest in directing the _[Iron\nMan](/wiki/Iron_Man_\\(2008_film\\) \"Iron Man \\(2008 film\\)\")_ film adaptation.\n[Jon Favreau](/wiki/Jon_Favreau \"Jon Favreau\") had taken that project, so\nMarvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he\ncould replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their\nintent.[41] Leterrier's primary inspiration was [Jeph Loeb](/wiki/Jeph_Loeb\n\"Jeph Loeb\") and [Tim Sale](/wiki/Tim_Sale_\\(artist\\) \"Tim Sale \\(artist\\)\")'s\n_Hulk: Gray_ (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated\nevery comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many\ncomics he browsed, in the final film.[9] Leterrier said that he planned to\nshow Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him,[42] while Feige\nadded the film would explore \"that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming\nan injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite\nrealize you had in yourself\".[43] Arad also said the film would be \"a lot more\nof a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross\".[44]\n\n[Zak Penn](/wiki/Zak_Penn \"Zak Penn\"), who wrote a draft of the first film in\n1996, said the film would follow up _Hulk_ , but stressed it would be more\ntonally similar to the TV show and [Bruce Jones](/wiki/Bruce_Jones_\\(comics\\)\n\"Bruce Jones \\(comics\\)\")' [run on the\ncomic](/wiki/Hulk_\\(comics\\)#Bibliography \"Hulk \\(comics\\)\"). He compared his\nscript to _[Aliens](/wiki/Aliens_\\(film\\) \"Aliens \\(film\\)\")_ , which was a\nvery different film from _[Alien](/wiki/Alien_\\(film\\) \"Alien \\(film\\)\")_ ,\nbut still in the same continuity.[13] He included two scenes from his 1996\nscript: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and\nrealizing he is unable to have sex with Betty.[45] After the studio rejected a\ntreatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before\ndeparting in early 2007 to promote his film _[The\nGrand](/wiki/The_Grand_\\(film\\) \"The Grand \\(film\\)\")_.[46] Norton, that\nApril, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him\nas both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually\nobligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his\ndraft as late as halfway through principal photography.[46] In November 2006,\na June 13, 2008 release date was set.[47] Leterrier acknowledged the only\nremaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South\nAmerica,[9] and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences\nwould have expected another forty-minute origin story.[48] There were previous\ndiscussions to set the first act in Thailand.[49] Leterrier felt audiences\nwere left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film.[48]\nFeige commented, \"we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we\nthought people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that...\nOne reason we made _Incredible Hulk_ was to get Hulk into the [[Marvel\nCinematic Universe](/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe \"Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse\")] canon.\"[50]\n\nShortly after the release of _The Incredible Hulk_ , Gale Anne Hurd commented\non the uncertainty of its relationship with Ang Lee's _Hulk_ film. \"We\ncouldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's\nkind of sequel.\" Hurd said that \"requel\", a\n[portmanteau](/wiki/Portmanteau_word \"Portmanteau word\") of \"reboot\" and\n\"sequel\", was a \"perfect\" description for the film.[51] Norton explained his\ndecision to ignore Lee's origin story: \"I don't even like the phrase 'origin\nstory', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining\nthe roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning.\"[12] \"Audiences\nknow this story,\" he added, \"[so] deal with it artfully.\" He wanted to \"have\nrevelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in\nmotion\".[14] The new origin story references [Ultimate\nMarvel](/wiki/Ultimate_Marvel \"Ultimate Marvel\")'s take on the Hulk, which\nalso had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers.[52] Norton removed\n[Rick Jones](/wiki/Rick_Jones_\\(comics\\) \"Rick Jones \\(comics\\)\") and toned\ndown [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D. \"S.H.I.E.L.D.\")'s presence.[20] He also\nadded the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his\ne-mailing with Samuel Sterns,[45] which references Bruce Jones' story.[53]\nNorton rewrote scenes every day.[22] Ultimately, the [Writers Guild of\nAmerica](/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America \"Writers Guild of America\") decided to\ncredit the script solely to Penn,[54] who argued Norton had not dramatically\nchanged his script. Journalist [Anne\nThompson](/wiki/Anne_Thompson_\\(film_critic\\) \"Anne Thompson \\(film critic\\)\")\nexplained \"The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing\ncharacters over dialogue.\"[45] Penn said in 2008, \"I wasn't happy with\n[Norton] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script.\"[55] Before\neither Penn and Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a\ndraft and lobbied for credit.[45]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\nLeterrier had to direct four [units](/wiki/Second_unit \"Second unit\") with a\nbroken foot.[15] Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting primarily took place\nin [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\"), because mayor [David\nMiller](/wiki/David_Miller_\\(Canadian_politician\\) \"David Miller \\(Canadian\npolitician\\)\") is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when\nclosing [Yonge Street](/wiki/Yonge_Street \"Yonge Street\") for four nights in\nSeptember to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the\nstreet with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean\nit up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day.[56]\nThe first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was\nfilmed at the [University of Toronto](/wiki/University_of_Toronto \"University\nof Toronto\") and [Morningside Park](/wiki/Morningside_Park_\\(Toronto\\)\n\"Morningside Park \\(Toronto\\)\"). The filmmakers built a glass wall over a\nwalkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke\nhim out.[26] There was also shooting in the [Financial\nDistrict](/wiki/Financial_District,_Toronto \"Financial District,\nToronto\").[27] A factory in [Hamilton, Ontario](/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario\n\"Hamilton, Ontario\"), which was due for demolition, was the interior of the\nBrazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military\ncommand center.[56] The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on\na [backlot](/wiki/Backlot \"Backlot\") in Hamilton.[57] Other Canadian locations\nincluded [CFB Trenton](/wiki/CFB_Trenton \"CFB Trenton\") and a glacier in Bella\nCoola, British Columbia.[27] Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in [New\nYork City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") and two weeks in Rio de\nJaneiro.[58] While there, the crew shot at Rocinha,\n[Lapa](/wiki/Lapa,_Rio_de_Janeiro \"Lapa, Rio de Janeiro\"), [Tijuca\nForest](/wiki/Tijuca_Forest \"Tijuca Forest\") and [Santa\nTeresa](/wiki/Santa_Teresa_\\(Rio_de_Janeiro\\) \"Santa Teresa \\(Rio de\nJaneiro\\)\"). Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of\nfilming.[27]\n\n_The Incredible Hulk_ joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut\n[carbon emissions](/wiki/Carbon_emissions \"Carbon emissions\") and waste\ncreated during filming.[59] Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk,\nbeing green, was a popular environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an\nenvironmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low\nsulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a\nsustainably harvested, locally sourced [yellow pine](/wiki/Pinus_echinata\n\"Pinus echinata\") instead of [lauan](/wiki/Decorative_plywood \"Decorative\nplywood\") for the sets, and also used zero-or\nlow-[VOC](/wiki/Volatile_Organic_Compounds \"Volatile Organic Compounds\")\npaint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental\norganizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition,\nthey used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food\nutensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor\nwho removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the\ntrailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable\nbatteries.[27] _The Incredible Hulk_ became the first blockbuster film to\nreceive the [Environmental Media\nAssociation](/wiki/Environmental_Media_Association \"Environmental Media\nAssociation\")'s Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.[60]\n\n### Post-\nproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Post-production\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/MovieAbomination.jpg/220px-\nMovieAbomination.jpg)](/wiki/File:MovieAbomination.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MovieAbomination.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLeterrier's finished redesign of the Abomination.\n\nLeterrier cited [Andy Serkis](/wiki/Andy_Serkis \"Andy Serkis\")' [motion\ncapture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion capture\") portrayals of\n[Gollum](/wiki/Gollum \"Gollum\") and [King Kong](/wiki/King_Kong \"King Kong\")\nin _[The Lord of the Rings](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_\\(film_series\\) \"The\nLord of the Rings \\(film series\\)\")_ and _[King\nKong](/wiki/King_Kong_\\(2005_film\\) \"King Kong \\(2005 film\\)\")_ ,\nrespectively, as the standard he was aiming for.[41] Norton and Roth filmed\n2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's\n\"thunder claps\").[27] [Phosphorescent](/wiki/Phosphorescent \"Phosphorescent\")\n[face paint](/wiki/Face_paint \"Face paint\") applied to the actors' faces and\n[strobe lighting](/wiki/Strobe_light \"Strobe light\") would help record the\nmost subtle mannerisms into the computer.[61] Others including [Cyril\nRaffaelli](/wiki/Cyril_Raffaelli \"Cyril Raffaelli\") provided motion capture\nfor stunts and fights,[23] after the main actors had done video\nreferencing.[62] Leterrier hired [Rhythm and\nHues](/wiki/Rhythm_and_Hues_Studios \"Rhythm and Hues Studios\") to provide the\nCGI, rather than [Industrial Light & Magic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic\n\"Industrial Light & Magic\") who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's\n_Hulk_. Visual effect company, [Image Engine](/wiki/Image_Engine \"Image\nEngine\"), spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated\nblood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.[63] Overall 700\neffects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of\nmovements, but overall [key frame](/wiki/Key_frame \"Key frame\") animation by\nRhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".[64]\nMany of the animators and Leterrier himself provided video reference for the\nclimactic fight.[26]\n\n[Dale Keown](/wiki/Dale_Keown \"Dale Keown\")'s comic book artwork of the Hulk\nwas an inspiration for his design.[41] Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too\nmuch fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is\nbeyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and\nstrength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"[41] [Visual effects\nsupervisor](/wiki/Visual_effects_supervisor \"Visual effects supervisor\") Kurt\nWilliams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [linebacker](/wiki/Linebacker\n\"Linebacker\") rather than a [bodybuilder](/wiki/Bodybuilder \"Bodybuilder\"). A\nheight of nine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to\nbe too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the\ninflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams\ncited [flushing](/wiki/Flushing_\\(physiology\\) \"Flushing \\(physiology\\)\") as\nan example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.[27] The\nanimators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than\nlighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an\n[olive](/wiki/Olive \"Olive\") or even gray [slate](/wiki/Slate \"Slate\").[61]\nHis animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge\nof what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they\nimagined, in case the model was to be used for _The Avengers_ film.[64] The\nHulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [Mike Deodato](/wiki/Mike_Deodato\n\"Mike Deodato\")'s art.[64] He originally had a [crew cut](/wiki/Crew_cut \"Crew\ncut\"), but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.[62]\nLeterrier cited _[An American Werewolf in\nLondon](/wiki/An_American_Werewolf_in_London \"An American Werewolf in\nLondon\")_ as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how\npainful it was for him to change.[65] As a nod to the live action TV series,\nBanner's eyes change color first when he transforms.[66] Leterrier changed the\nAbomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would\nquestion why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of \"an\n[über](/wiki/%C3%9Cber \"Über\")-human\" like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness\nis derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and\nbones; creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can\nuse to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange\nbecause of surrounding fire during the climactic battle.[24] The motion\ncapture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less\ngracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his\nhead on a shark.[38] The character also shares Roth's tattoos.[67] A height of\neleven feet was chosen for the character.[27] Leterrier tried to work in the\ncharacter's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the\nexample of [Mike Tyson](/wiki/Mike_Tyson \"Mike Tyson\") when he fought [Evander\nHolyfield](/wiki/Evander_Holyfield \"Evander Holyfield\")), and felt ignoring\nthat would make the Hulk come across as stupid.[68]\n\nLeterrier had planned to use [prosthetic makeup](/wiki/Prosthetic_makeup\n\"Prosthetic makeup\") and [animatronics](/wiki/Animatronic \"Animatronic\") to\ncomplement the [computer-generated imagery](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery\n\"Computer-generated imagery\") that was solely used in the previous film.[69]\nThe make-up artists who worked on _[X-Men: The Last\nStand](/wiki/X-Men:_The_Last_Stand \"X-Men: The Last Stand\")_ were set to\nportray Blonsky's gradual transformation,[22] which Zak Penn said would\nportray Blonsky \"not [being] used to having these properties. Like he's much\nheavier, and we talked about how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight\ndestroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [It's all about] the humanization of\nthese kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually\nhave on [them].\"[70] Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created\nall the costumes for the _[Alien](/wiki/Alien_\\(franchise\\) \"Alien\n\\(franchise\\)\")_ films since _[Alien 3](/wiki/Alien_3 \"Alien 3\")_) was in\nnegotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as\nstand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was\ndecided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a\ncomputer graphic.[71] An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head,\nhowever.[57] Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling\nmachine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The\nfilmmakers used steam and [dry ice](/wiki/Dry_ice \"Dry ice\") for the gas used\nto smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight\non it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the\nHulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from\nthe helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was\nattached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera\nwas pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked\nthat making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to\nact.[26]\n\n##\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\nFurther information: [The Incredible Hulk\n(soundtrack)](/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(soundtrack\\) \"The Incredible Hulk\n\\(soundtrack\\)\") and [Music of the Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse](/wiki/Music_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe \"Music of the Marvel\nCinematic Universe\")\n\nThe score for the film was composed by [Craig\nArmstrong](/wiki/Craig_Armstrong_\\(composer\\) \"Craig Armstrong \\(composer\\)\"),\nwho was the [arranger](/wiki/Arrangement \"Arrangement\") for [Massive\nAttack](/wiki/Massive_Attack \"Massive Attack\"), a band Leterrier was fond of\nand had collaborated with on the 2005 film\n_[Unleashed](/wiki/Unleashed_\\(film\\) \"Unleashed \\(film\\)\")_.

The\nwebsite's consensus reads, \"_The Incredible Hulk_ may not be quite the\nsmashing success that fans of Marvel's raging behemoth might hope for, but it\noffers more than enough big green action to make up for its occasionally puny\nnarrative.\"[93] [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\") gave the film an\naverage score of 61 out of 100, based on 38 reviews. The site characterized\nreviews as \"generally favorable\".[94] A [CinemaScore](/wiki/CinemaScore\n\"CinemaScore\") poll indicated the majority of viewers were male and graded the\nfilm an A-, and 82% of them had seen the 2003 film.[95]\n\nTodd McCarthy of _[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ said, \"what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary revival of\na big screen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in _The\nIncredible Hulk_.\" He emphasized \"it's all par-for-the-course cinematic\ndemolition and destruction, staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm,\"\nand \"penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky,\nbut editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-\npresent score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the\naction. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired\nachievements.\"[96] Rene Rodriguez of _[The Miami\nHerald](/wiki/The_Miami_Herald \"The Miami Herald\")_ applauded that the film\n\"does a lot of things [Ang] Lee's _Hulk_ didn't: It's lighter and faster-\npaced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series\nthat furthered the character's popularity\".[97] Mark Rahner of _[The Seattle\nTimes](/wiki/The_Seattle_Times \"The Seattle Times\")_ wrote that, \"The relaunch\nof Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous\n2003 _Hulk_ in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks\nscarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely\ntalks\".[98] [Lou Lumenick](/wiki/Lou_Lumenick \"Lou Lumenick\") of the _[New\nYork Post](/wiki/New_York_Post \"New York Post\")_ said, \"What lingers in my\nmemory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the\nHulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier\nshowdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying\nhigh-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by\ndirector Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening\ncredits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [Ang]\nLee took\".[99] [Roger Ebert](/wiki/Roger_Ebert \"Roger Ebert\") was not a fan of\nthe film stating, \"_The Incredible Hulk_ is no doubt an ideal version of the\nHulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's _Hulk_ too talky, or dare I say, too\nthoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and\nspends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action\nsequences.\"[100]\n\nConversely, [Christy Lemire](/wiki/Christy_Lemire \"Christy Lemire\") of the\n_[Associated Press](/wiki/Associated_Press \"Associated Press\")_ found that\n\"the inevitable comparisons to _Iron Man_ , Marvel Studios' first blockbuster\nthis summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and\nheart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just\nas deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's\ninner conflict\".[101] [A.O. Scott](/wiki/A.O._Scott \"A.O. Scott\") of _[The New\nYork Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ opined, \"'The\nAdequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big,\nthumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, but for the most\npart this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean\".[102] [David\nAnsen](/wiki/David_Ansen \"David Ansen\") of _[Newsweek](/wiki/Newsweek\n\"Newsweek\")_ wrote, \"Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager\nto give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once\nthe movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this \"Hulk\"\nsinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ... The\nmovie's scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson, making a comically welcome third\nact appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel\nSterns\".[103]\n\nThe film was nominated for best superhero film at the 2008 [National Movie\nAwards](/wiki/National_Movie_Awards \"National Movie Awards\") and for Best\nScience Fiction Film at the [Saturn Awards](/wiki/Saturn_Award \"Saturn\nAward\"), but lost to _[The Dark Knight](/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_\\(film\\) \"The\nDark Knight \\(film\\)\")_ and _Iron Man_ , respectively.[104][105]\n\n##\nFuture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Future\")]\n\nFurther information: [List of Marvel Cinematic Universe\nfilms](/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films \"List of Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse films\")\n\nOn a potential sequel, Norton said, \"The whole thing was to envision it in\nmultiple parts. We left a lot out on purpose. [_The Incredible Hulk_ is]\ndefinitely intended as chapter one.\"[14] Leterrier made the film's final shot\nof Banner ambiguous; the thought being if there is a sequel, it would mean\nBanner finally masters control over his anger; if there is not a sequel, the\nshot indicates instead that he becomes a menace in _The Avengers_.[106]\nLeterrier had also intended for a scene in the credits showing Blonsky, human\nonce more, imprisoned and chained in a box.[107] The character of Samuel\nSterns, played by [Tim Blake Nelson](/wiki/Tim_Blake_Nelson \"Tim Blake\nNelson\"), was introduced to set him up as a villain in a possible future film,\nwhere he would become the Leader.[20][108] Aaron Sims, the lead designer on\n_The Incredible Hulk_ , also took time to work on concepts for the\nLeader.[109] Nelson is \"signed on\" to reprise the role.[110] [Ty\nBurrell](/wiki/Ty_Burrell \"Ty Burrell\") wants to portray the superpowered Doc\nSamson faithfully to the comics.[110]\n\nLeterrier and Roth were originally contracted to return. Leterrier also stated\nNorton was not signed on,[111] but in October 2008, Hurd stated that Norton\nwas contracted to reprise the role.[112] The film had outgrossed its\npredecessor and Universal indicated interest in a sequel,[113] though\nLeterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film's box office\nreturn.[114] Feige said the film met Marvel's expectations and that Hulk would\nreturn, but after the crossover.[115] Hurd was not concerned that a sequel may\nnot be produced until at least 2012, citing the positive reception to the film\nand having produced the _[Terminator](/wiki/Terminator_\\(franchise\\)\n\"Terminator \\(franchise\\)\")_ series, the second and third film of which had a\n12-year gap.[112] Tim Roth confirmed that Marvel had signed him for three more\nfilms.[116] Leterrier, after having previously said he did not want to direct\na sequel,[117] said in late 2009 he had changed his mind and was now\namenable.[118]\n\n[Mark Ruffalo](/wiki/Mark_Ruffalo \"Mark Ruffalo\") began his role as Banner /\nHulk in _The Avengers_ , after Feige said he chose not to bring back\nNorton.[119][120] In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk\nagain because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to\nbe associated with only one character.[121] In April 2012, despite Ruffalo\nbeing on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to\n[Collider](/wiki/Collider.com \"Collider.com\") that Marvel had no plans at that\ntime to film another Hulk film.[122] In a Q&A session, Feige and Ruffalo\nconfirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to\nthe positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in _The\nAvengers_.[123] In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story\noptions for a sequel film, including a film based on the \"[Planet\nHulk](/wiki/Planet_Hulk \"Planet Hulk\")\" and \"[World War\nHulk](/wiki/World_War_Hulk \"World War Hulk\")\" storylines, stated, \"everything\n[in terms of stories from the comics] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can\ncarry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in _Avengers_? I do believe\nthat. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to\nattempt that until _Avengers 2_. So there's a lot of time to think about\nit.\"[124]\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a\nnew standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time,\nentertaining the idea of it. When we did _The Avengers_ it was basically\n'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing\ndefinitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be.\"[125] In July,\nFeige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that\ntime, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did\nnot rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and\nexplained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [Phase\nTwo](/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films#Phase_Two \"List of Marvel\nCinematic Universe films\") of the MCU by saying, \"After the first _Avengers_ ,\nIron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his\nown movie, and Widow and Fury were in _[The Winter\nSoldier](/wiki/Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier \"Captain America: The\nWinter Soldier\")_. So it was really about, frankly, _saving_ somebody so that\nthe only place you could get Hulk between _Avengers_ movies is the _next_\n_Avengers_ movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that\nin [_Avengers: Age of Ultron_]. Where we go after that, we'll see.\"[126] In\nOctober 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said, \"We'll see. We'd love to do\nit, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be\nappearing, with his friends, in their [[Phase\nThree](/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films#Phase_Three \"List of\nMarvel Cinematic Universe films\")] films.\"[127]\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk\nfilms may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film[128] and\nreiterated this in October 2015,[129] and July 2017.[130] Marvel reacquired\nthe film rights for the character, but Universal retained the distribution\nrights for _The Incredible Hulk_ as well as the [right of first\nrefusal](/wiki/Right_of_first_refusal \"Right of first refusal\") to distribute\nfuture Hulk films.[131] According to _The Hollywood Reporter_ , a potential\nreason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk\nas they did with [Paramount Pictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount\nPictures\") for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because\nUniversal holds the [theme park](/wiki/Universal_Parks_%26_Resorts \"Universal\nParks & Resorts\") rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent\ncompany, [Disney](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company \"The Walt Disney Company\"),\nwants for its own [theme parks](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Parks_and_Resorts \"Walt\nDisney Parks and Resorts\").[132] In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the\nstrained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to\nreleasing a future standalone Hulk film.[133] The following month, he\nindicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to\nplay a more prominent role in _[Thor: Ragnarok](/wiki/Thor:_Ragnarok \"Thor:\nRagnarok\")_ , _[Avengers: Infinity War](/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\")_ , and [the latter's untitled\nsequel](/wiki/Untitled_Avengers_film \"Untitled Avengers film\"), stating,\n\"We’ve worked a really interesting arc into _Thor[: Ragnarok]_ , _Avengers[:\nInfinity War]_ , and [the latter's sequel] for Banner that I think will – when\nit’s all added up – will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie.\"[134]\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed.[4] The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of _[Iron Man 2](/wiki/Iron_Man_2 \"Iron Man 2\")_ (2010) and _[Thor](/wiki/Thor_\\(film\\) \"Thor \\(film\\)\")_ (2011),[5] the former of which is set six months after the events of _[Iron Man](/wiki/Iron_Man_\\(2008_film\\) \"Iron Man \\(2008 film\\)\")_ (2008).[6]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Hulk_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"_The Incredible Hulk_ \"](http://www.bbfc.co.uk/AFF247523/).
