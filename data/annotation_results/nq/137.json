When they first arrive, Ethel notices the\n[loons](/wiki/Loon \"Loon\") calling on the lake \"welcoming them home\". As they\nresettle into their summer home, Norman's memory problems arise when he is\nunable to recognize several family photographs, which he copes with by\nfrequently talking about death and growing old. They are visited by their only\nchild, a daughter, Chelsea, who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a\nfather. She introduces her parents to her fiance Bill and his thirteen-year-\nold son Billy. Norman tries to play mind games with Bill, an apparent pastime\nof his, but Bill won't hear of it, saying he can only take so much. In another\nconversation, Chelsea discusses with Ethel her frustration over her\nrelationship with her overbearing father, feeling that even though she lives\nthousands of miles away in Los Angeles, she still feels like she's answering\nto him. Before they depart for a European vacation, Chelsea and Bill ask the\nThayers to permit Billy to stay with them while they have some time to\nthemselves. Norman, seeming more senile and cynical than usual due to his 80th\nbirthday and heart palpitations, agrees to Billy's staying. Ethel tells him\nthat he's the sweetest man in the world, but she is the only one who knows it.\n\nBilly is at first annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends\nnearby and nothing to do. He resents Norman's brusque manner, but eventually\ncomes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Billy and Norman\nsoon grow obsessed with catching Norman's fish rival, named \"Walter\", which\nleads to the accidental destruction of the Thayers' motorboat. Chelsea returns\nto find out her father has made good friends with her fiance's, now husband's,\nson. But when she sees the change in her father's demeanor, Chelsea attempts\nsomething Billy accomplished that she never could: a backflip. Chelsea\nsuccessfully executes the dive in front of a cheering Norman, Billy, and\nEthel. Chelsea and Norman finally fully embrace before she departs with Billy\nback home.\n\nThe final day on Golden Pond comes and the Thayers are loading the last of the\nboxes. Norman tries to move a heavy box, but starts having heart pain and\ncollapses onto the floor of the porch. Ethel tries unsuccessfully to get the\noperator to phone the hospital. Norman then says the pain is gone and attempts\nto stand to say a final farewell to the lake. Ethel tells him she has always\nknown about death but for the first time it felt real, thinking Norman was\ngoing to die on the spot. Ethel helps Norman to the edge of the lake where\nthey see the loons and Norman notes how they are just like him and Ethel, that\ntheir offspring is grown and gone off on her own, and now it is just the two\nof them.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=On_Golden_Pond_\\(1981_film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Katharine Hepburn](/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn \"Katharine Hepburn\") – Ethel Thayer\n  * [Henry Fonda](/wiki/Henry_Fonda \"Henry Fonda\") – Norman Thayer Jr.\n  * [Jane Fonda](/wiki/Jane_Fonda \"Jane Fonda\") – Chelsea Thayer Wayne\n  * [Doug McKeon](/wiki/Doug_McKeon \"Doug McKeon\") – Billy Ray\n  * [Dabney Coleman](/wiki/Dabney_Coleman \"Dabney Coleman\") – Bill Ray\n  * [William Lanteau](/wiki/William_Lanteau \"William Lanteau\") – Charlie Martin\n  * [Christopher Rydell](/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Rydell&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Christopher Rydell \\(page does not exist\\)\") – Sumner Todd\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=On_Golden_Pond_\\(1981_film\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

A gazebo and a small boathouse were also relocated during\nthe shoot.\n\nDespite their many common acquaintances and long careers in show business,\nHenry Fonda and [Katharine Hepburn](/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn \"Katharine\nHepburn\") not only had never worked together, but had never met until working\non the film. On the first day of shooting, Hepburn presented Henry Fonda with\nher longtime companion [Spencer Tracy](/wiki/Spencer_Tracy \"Spencer Tracy\")'s\n\"lucky\" hat, which Fonda wore in the film. Hepburn, who was 74 at the time of\nfilming, performed all her own stunts, including a dive into the pond. The\nscene in which Norman and step-grandson Billy run their boat into the rocks\nwas filmed repeatedly. The vintage 1951 mahogany [Chris-Craft](/wiki/Chris-\nCraft \"Chris-Craft\") boat, used strictly for the crash scene, was so sturdy\nthat it kept bouncing off the rocks without any damage.[5][6][7] The crew had\nto modify the boat so it would break away in the wreck. The water level in\nSquam Lake was so low during the summer of production that Fonda and Doug\nMcKeon could have stood during the scene in which they were supposedly\nclinging to the rocks for fear of drowning. The September water was barely\nknee-deep, but it was cold enough that the pair had to wear wetsuits under\ntheir clothes. Hepburn, on the other hand, dove into the water without the aid\nof the wetsuit because she wanted the scene to keep its authenticity. Some of\nthe scenes in which Billy takes the boat out on his own were filmed on nearby\n[Lake Winnipesaukee](/wiki/Lake_Winnipesaukee \"Lake Winnipesaukee\"). While\nfilming the scene where Fonda and Hepburn were watching the\n[loons](/wiki/Common_loon \"Common loon\") on the lake, the speedboat that\nzoomed by and disturbed them was so forceful it overturned their canoe in one\ntake; Fonda was immediately taken out of the water and wrapped up in blankets\nas his health was fragile by that time. The speedboat was piloted by the\nscreenwriter, Ernest Thompson.\n\nWhen visiting [Holderness, New Hampshire](/wiki/Holderness,_New_Hampshire\n\"Holderness, New Hampshire\"), one can take a boat tour of Squam Lake and view\nthe filming sites from the movie. There is also a restaurant called \"Walter's\nBasin\", which is named after the trout called \"Walter\" that Billy catches with\nNorman. For filming, \"Walter\" was brought in from a trout pond at the nearby\n[Castle in the Clouds](/wiki/Castle_in_the_Clouds \"Castle in the Clouds\")\nestate. He was released after his capture back into Squam Lake. Leftover\nfootage of Fonda and Hepburn driving through the New Hampshire countryside, as\nseen in the opening credits, was later used for the opening of the\n[CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") television sitcom _[Newhart](/wiki/Newhart \"Newhart\")_.\n\nThe [studio](/wiki/Film_studio \"Film studio\") behind the film was [ITC\nEntertainment](/wiki/ITC_Entertainment \"ITC Entertainment\"), the British\ncompany presided over (until late 1981) by [Lord\nGrade](/wiki/Lew_Grade,_Baron_Grade \"Lew Grade, Baron Grade\"), the television\nand film [mogul](/wiki/Media_mogul \"Media mogul\"). It was Grade who largely\nraised the financing for the film.\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=On_Golden_Pond_\\(1981_film\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\n### Box\noffice[[edit](/w/index.php?title=On_Golden_Pond_\\(1981_film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Box office\")]\n\nWith a box office take of $119,285,432, _On Golden Pond_ was the [second-\nhighest grossing film of the year](/wiki/1981_in_film \"1981 in film\"),\nfollowing _[Raiders of the Lost Ark](/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark \"Raiders of\nthe Lost Ark\")_ , which earned $209,562,121.[8]\n\n### Critical\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=On_Golden_Pond_\\(1981_film\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Critical Reception\")]\n\n[![Cropped screenshot of Henry Fonda from the film\nSlim](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Henry_Fonda_-\n_USN.jpg/150px-Henry_Fonda_-_USN.jpg)](/wiki/File:Henry_Fonda_-_USN.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Henry_Fonda_-_USN.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Henry Fonda](/wiki/Henry_Fonda \"Henry Fonda\") received the [Academy Award for\nBest Actor](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor \"Academy Award for Best Actor\")\nfor his performance as Norman Thayer, marking his only competitive Oscar win\nand at 76 became the oldest winner in the category\n\n_On Golden Pond_ garnered widespread critical acclaim with critics\nhighlighting the performances of Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda.
