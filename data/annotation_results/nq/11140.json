However, economic recovery had been observed\nat the beginning of the 14th century. In the 1330s, a large number of natural\ndisasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a\ndeadly plague arriving soon after.[14] Epidemics that may have included plague\nkilled an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years\nbefore it reached [Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople \"Constantinople\") in\n1347.[15][16]\n\nThe disease may have travelled along the [Silk Road](/wiki/Silk_Road \"Silk\nRoad\") with [Mongol](/wiki/Mongols \"Mongols\") armies and traders or it could\nhave come via ship.[17] By the end of 1346, reports of plague had reached the\nseaports of Europe: \"India was depopulated, [Tartary](/wiki/Tartary\n\"Tartary\"), [Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia \"Mesopotamia\"),\n[Syria](/wiki/Syria \"Syria\"), [Armenia](/wiki/Armenia \"Armenia\") were covered\nwith dead bodies\".[18]\n\nPlague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via\n[Genoese](/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa \"Republic of Genoa\") traders at the port\ncity of [Kaffa](/wiki/Feodosia \"Feodosia\") in the [Crimea](/wiki/Crimea\n\"Crimea\") in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army\nunder [Jani Beg](/wiki/Jani_Beg \"Jani Beg\") was suffering from the disease,\nthe army catapulted infected corpses over the [city\nwalls](/wiki/Defensive_wall \"Defensive wall\") of Kaffa to infect the\ninhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into\n[Sicily](/wiki/Sicily \"Sicily\") and the south of Europe, whence it spread\nnorth.[19] Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that\nseveral existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to\nthe severity of the Black Death.\n\n### European outbreak\n\nThe seventh year after it began, it came to England and first began in the\ntowns and ports joining on the seacoasts, in Dorsetshire, where, as in other\ncounties, it made the country quite void of inhabitants so that there were\nalmost none left alive.  \n... But at length it came to Gloucester, yea even to Oxford and to London, and\nfinally it spread over all England and so wasted the people that scarce the\ntenth person of any sort was left alive.\n\n[Geoffrey the Baker](/wiki/Geoffrey_the_Baker \"Geoffrey the Baker\"),\n_Chronicon Angliae_\n\nThere appear to have been several introductions into Europe. The plague\nreached Sicily in October 1347, carried by twelve Genoese galleys,[20] and\nrapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from [Kaffa](/wiki/Feodosia\n\"Feodosia\") reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak\nin [Pisa](/wiki/Pisa \"Pisa\") a few weeks later that was the entry point to\nnorthern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from\nItaly arrived in [Marseille](/wiki/Marseille \"Marseille\").[21]\n\nFrom Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France,\nSpain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through\nGermany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced in Norway in 1349\nwhen a ship landed at [Askøy](/wiki/Ask%C3%B8y \"Askøy\"), then spread to\nBjørgvin (modern [Bergen](/wiki/Bergen \"Bergen\")) and [Iceland](/wiki/Iceland\n\"Iceland\").[22] Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351. The plague\nwas somewhat less common in parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations\nwith their neighbours, including the majority of the [Basque\nCountry](/wiki/Basque_Country_\\(greater_region\\) \"Basque Country \\(greater\nregion\\)\"), isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine\nvillages throughout the continent.[23][24]\n\nModern researchers do not think that the plague ever became endemic in Europe\nor its rat population. The disease repeatedly wiped out the rodent carriers so\nthat the fleas died out until a new outbreak from Central Asia repeated the\nprocess. The outbreaks have been shown to occur roughly 15 years after a\nwarmer and wetter period in areas where plague is endemic in other species\nsuch as [gerbils](/wiki/Gerbils \"Gerbils\").[25][26]\n\n### Middle Eastern outbreak\n\nThe plague struck various regions in the Middle East during the\n[pandemic](/wiki/Pandemic \"Pandemic\"), leading to serious depopulation and\npermanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread from\nChina with the [Mongols](/wiki/Mongols \"Mongols\") to a trading post in Crimea,\ncalled Kaffa, controlled by the [Republic of Genoa](/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa\n\"Republic of Genoa\"). From there the disease, infected rodents infecting new\nrodents, entered the region from southern Russia also. By autumn 1347, the\nplague reached [Alexandria](/wiki/Alexandria \"Alexandria\") in Egypt, through\nthe port's trade with [Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople \"Constantinople\"),\nand ports on the [Black Sea](/wiki/Black_Sea \"Black Sea\"). During 1347, the\ndisease travelled eastward to [Gaza](/wiki/Gaza_City \"Gaza City\"), and north\nalong the eastern coast to cities in [Lebanon](/wiki/Lebanon \"Lebanon\"),\n[Syria](/wiki/Syria \"Syria\") and [Palestine](/wiki/Palestine_\\(region\\)\n\"Palestine \\(region\\)\"), including [Ashkelon](/wiki/Ashkelon \"Ashkelon\"),\n[Acre](/wiki/Acre,_Israel \"Acre, Israel\"), [Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem\n\"Jerusalem\"), [Sidon](/wiki/Sidon \"Sidon\"), [Damascus](/wiki/Damascus\n\"Damascus\"), [Homs](/wiki/Homs \"Homs\"), and [Aleppo](/wiki/Aleppo \"Aleppo\").\nIn 1348–1349, the disease reached [Antioch](/wiki/Antioch \"Antioch\"). The\ncity's residents fled to the north, However most of them ended up dying during\nthe journey.[27]\n\n[Mecca](/wiki/Mecca \"Mecca\") became infected in 1349. During the same year,\nrecords show the city of [Mawsil](/wiki/Mosul \"Mosul\") (Mosul) suffered a\nmassive epidemic, and the city of [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\")\nexperienced a second round of the disease.\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Acral_gangrene_due_to_plague.jpg/220px-\nAcral_gangrene_due_to_plague.jpg)](/wiki/File:Acral_gangrene_due_to_plague.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Acral_gangrene_due_to_plague.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA hand showing how [acral](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/acral \"wikt:acral\")\n[gangrene](/wiki/Gangrene \"Gangrene\") of the [fingers](/wiki/Digit_\\(anatomy\\)\n\"Digit \\(anatomy\\)\") due to [bubonic plague](/wiki/Bubonic_plague \"Bubonic\nplague\") causes the skin and [flesh](/wiki/Tissue_\\(biology\\) \"Tissue\n\\(biology\\)\") to [die](/wiki/Tissue_necrosis \"Tissue necrosis\") and turn black\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Plague_bubo.jpg/220px-\nPlague_bubo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Plague_bubo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Plague_bubo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn inguinal bubo on the upper thigh of a person infected with bubonic plague.\nSwollen lymph glands (_buboes_) often occur in the neck, armpit and groin\n(_inguinal_) regions of plague victims.\n\nContemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most\ncommonly noted symptom was the appearance of [buboes](/wiki/Bubo \"Bubo\") (or\ngavocciolos) in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when\nopened.[28] [Boccaccio](/wiki/Boccaccio \"Boccaccio\")'s description:\n\n> In men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain\n> tumours in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common\n> apple, others as an egg...From the two said parts of the body this deadly\n> gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions\n> indifferently; after which the form of the malady began to change, black\n> spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh\n> or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute and numerous. As the gavocciolo\n> had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also\n> were these spots on whomsoever they showed themselves.[29]\n\nThe only medical detail that is questionable in Boccaccio's description is\nthat the gavocciolo was an 'infallible token of approaching death', as, if the\nbubo discharges, recovery is possible.[30]\n\nThis was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most victims died two\nto seven days after initial infection. Freckle-like spots and rashes,[31]\nwhich could have been caused by flea-bites, were identified as another\npotential sign of the plague.\n\nSome accounts, like that of [Lodewijk Heyligen](/wiki/Lodewijk_Heyligen\n\"Lodewijk Heyligen\"), whose master the [Cardinal\nColonna](/wiki/Giovanni_Colonna_\\(cardinal,_1295%E2%80%931348\\) \"Giovanni\nColonna \\(cardinal, 1295–1348\\)\") died of the plague in 1348, noted a distinct\nform of the disease that infected the lungs and led to respiratory\nproblems[28] and is identified with [pneumonic plague](/wiki/Pneumonic_plague\n\"Pneumonic plague\").\n\n> It is said that the plague takes three forms.

The most authoritative account at the time came from the\nmedical faculty in Paris in a report to the [king of\nFrance](/wiki/Philip_VI_of_France \"Philip VI of France\") that blamed the\nheavens, in the form of a [conjunction](/wiki/Conjunction_\\(astronomy\\)\n\"Conjunction \\(astronomy\\)\") of three planets in 1345 that caused a \"great\npestilence in the air\".[34] This report became the first and most widely\ncirculated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to\nsufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely\naccepted theory. Today, this is known as the [miasma\ntheory](/wiki/Miasma_theory \"Miasma theory\"). The word _plague_ had no special\nsignificance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the\nMiddle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.\n\nThe importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until\nthen it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all\nsorts around and human parasites abounding. A transmissible disease will\nspread easily in such conditions. One development as a result of the Black\nDeath was the establishment of the idea of [quarantine](/wiki/Quarantine\n\"Quarantine\") in [Dubrovnik](/wiki/Dubrovnik \"Dubrovnik\") in 1377 after\ncontinuing outbreaks.[35]\n\nThe dominant explanation for the Black Death is the\n[plague](/wiki/Plague_\\(disease\\) \"Plague \\(disease\\)\") theory, which\nattributes the outbreak to _[Yersinia pestis](/wiki/Yersinia_pestis \"Yersinia\npestis\")_ , also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in\n1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that\ncaused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited\nHong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist [Alexandre\nYersin](/wiki/Alexandre_Yersin \"Alexandre Yersin\"), after whom the pathogen\nwas named _Yersinia pestis_.[36] The mechanism by which _Y. pestis_ was\nusually transmitted was established in 1898 by [Paul-Louis Simond](/wiki/Paul-\nLouis_Simond \"Paul-Louis Simond\") and was found to involve the bites of fleas\nwhose [midguts](/wiki/Midgut \"Midgut\") had become obstructed by replicating\n_Y. pestis_ several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage\nresults in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which\nrepeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by [regurgitation](/wiki/Vomiting\n\"Vomiting\"), resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the\nfeeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also\ndependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which\nact as hosts, keeping the disease [endemic](/wiki/Endemic_\\(epidemiology\\)\n\"Endemic \\(epidemiology\\)\"), and a second that lack resistance. When the\nsecond population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people,\nthus creating a human [epidemic](/wiki/Epidemic_typhus \"Epidemic typhus\").[36]\n\nThe historian [Francis Aidan Gasquet](/wiki/Francis_Aidan_Gasquet \"Francis\nAidan Gasquet\") wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893[37] and suggested\nthat \"it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic\nplague\". He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the\nBlack Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the\nprocess, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and\nmedieval epidemics, such as the [Justinian plague](/wiki/Justinian_plague\n\"Justinian plague\") that was prevalent in the [Eastern Roman\nEmpire](/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire \"Eastern Roman Empire\") from 541 to 700\nCE.[36]\n\nAn estimate of the [mortality rate](/wiki/Mortality_rate \"Mortality rate\") for\nthe modern [bubonic plague](/wiki/Bubonic_plague \"Bubonic plague\"), following\nthe introduction of antibiotics, is 11%, although it may be higher in\nunderdeveloped regions.[38] Symptoms of the disease include fever of 38–41 °C\n(100–106 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, [nausea](/wiki/Nausea\n\"Nausea\") and vomiting, and a general feeling of [malaise](/wiki/Malaise\n\"Malaise\"). Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 per\ncent die within eight days.[39] [Pneumonic plague](/wiki/Pneumonic_plague\n\"Pneumonic plague\") has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 per cent. Symptoms\ninclude fever, cough, and blood-tinged [sputum](/wiki/Sputum \"Sputum\"). As the\ndisease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. [Septicemic\nplague](/wiki/Septicemic_plague \"Septicemic plague\") is the least common of\nthe three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and\npurple skin patches ([purpura](/wiki/Purpura \"Purpura\") due to [disseminated\nintravascular coagulation](/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation\n\"Disseminated intravascular coagulation\")). In cases of pneumonic and\nparticularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that\nthere would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes\nthat were noted as buboes.[40]\n\nA number of alternative theories – implicating other diseases in the Black\nDeath pandemic – have also been proposed by some modern scientists (see below\n– \"Alternative Explanations\").\n\n### DNA evidence\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Bubonic_plague_victims-\nmass_grave_in_Martigues%2C_France_1720-1721.jpg/220px-Bubonic_plague_victims-\nmass_grave_in_Martigues%2C_France_1720-1721.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bubonic_plague_victims-\nmass_grave_in_Martigues,_France_1720-1721.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bubonic_plague_victims-\nmass_grave_in_Martigues,_France_1720-1721.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSkeletons in a mass grave from 1720–1721 in [Martigues](/wiki/Martigues\n\"Martigues\"), France, yielded molecular evidence of the _orientalis_ strain of\n_Yersinia pestis_ , the organism responsible for bubonic plague. The second\npandemic of bubonic plague was active in Europe from AD 1347, the beginning of\nthe Black Death, until 1750.\n\nIn October 2010, the open-access scientific journal _[PLoS\nPathogens](/wiki/PLoS_Pathogens \"PLoS Pathogens\")_ published a paper by a\nmultinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of\n_[Yersinia pestis](/wiki/Yersinia_pestis \"Yersinia pestis\")_ in the Black\nDeath following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998.\nThey assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with [polymerase chain\nreaction](/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction \"Polymerase chain reaction\") (PCR)\ntechniques for _Y. pestis_ from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass\ngraves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated\narchaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors\nconcluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south\nof France and Germany,[41] \"ends the debate about the cause of the Black\nDeath, and unambiguously demonstrates that _Y. pestis_ was the causative agent\nof the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages\".[42]\n\nThe study also found that there were two previously unknown but related\n[clades](/wiki/Clade \"Clade\") (genetic branches) of the _Y. pestis_\n[genome](/wiki/Genome \"Genome\") associated with medieval mass graves. These\nclades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern\nisolates of the modern _Y. pestis_ strains _Y. p. orientalis_ and _Y. p.\nmedievalis_ , suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves.\nSurveys of [plague pit](/wiki/Plague_pit \"Plague pit\") remains in France and\nEngland indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of\n[Marseille](/wiki/Marseille \"Marseille\") around November 1347 and spread\nthrough France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the\nspring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics.\nSurveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of [Bergen op\nZoom](/wiki/Bergen_op_Zoom \"Bergen op Zoom\") showed the _Y. pestis_ genotype\nresponsible for the pandemic that spread through the [Low\nCountries](/wiki/Low_Countries \"Low Countries\") from 1350 differed from that\nfound in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts\nof the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France\nin 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in\nBritain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway,\nthe [Hanseatic](/wiki/Hanseatic_League \"Hanseatic League\") cities or another\nsite.[42]\n\nThe results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended. Based\non genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the [East\nSmithfield](/wiki/East_Smithfield \"East Smithfield\") burial site in England,\nSchuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 \"that the Black Death in medieval Europe\nwas caused by a variant of _Y. pestis_ that may no longer exist.\"[43] A study\npublished in _[Nature](/wiki/Nature_\\(journal\\) \"Nature \\(journal\\)\")_ in\nOctober 2011 sequenced the genome of _Y. pestis_ from plague victims and\nindicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most\nmodern strains of the disease.[44]\n\nDNA taken from 25 skeletons from the 14th century found in London have shown\nthe plague is a strain of _Y. pestis_ that is almost identical to that which\nhit Madagascar in 2013.[45][46]\n\n### Alternative explanations\n\nMain article: [Theories of the Black Death](/wiki/Theories_of_the_Black_Death\n\"Theories of the Black Death\")\n\nThe plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British\nbacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates\nof mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent\nwith the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary\naccounts were exaggerations.[36] In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the\nfirst major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his\ndoubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of\nauthors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002 and 2013), [David\nHerlihy](/wiki/David_Herlihy \"David Herlihy\") (1997), and Susan Scott and\nChristopher Duncan (2001).[36]\n\nIt is recognised that an [epidemiological](/wiki/Epidemiological\n\"Epidemiological\") account of the plague is as important as an identification\nof symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics\nfrom this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in\nEngland, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over\n100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the\n[Domesday Book](/wiki/Domesday_Book \"Domesday Book\") and the year 1377.[47]\nEstimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the\nclergy.\n\nIn addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for\na bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out\nthat the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some\naccounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods\nwas likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be\nflawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples\nfrom other mass graves.[36] Other arguments include the lack of accounts of\nthe death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th\ncenturies; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival\nof fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black\nDeath was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates\nof the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague\nis largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck\nurban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major\noutbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern\nbubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-\nups.[36]\n\nMcCormick has suggested that earlier archaeologists were simply not interested\nin the \"laborious\" processes needed to discover rat remains.[48] Walløe\ncomplains that all of these authors \"take it for granted that Simond's\ninfection model, black rat → rat flea → human, which was developed to explain\nthe spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of _Yersinia\npestis_ infection could spread\", whilst pointing to several other\npossibilities.[49] Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is\nneeded to the range of (especially non-[commensal](/wiki/Commensalism\n\"Commensalism\")) animals that might be involved in the transmission of\nplague.[50]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Anthrax_PHIL_2033.png/220px-\nAnthrax_PHIL_2033.png)](/wiki/File:Anthrax_PHIL_2033.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Anthrax_PHIL_2033.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Anthrax](/wiki/Anthrax \"Anthrax\") skin lesion\n\nA variety of alternatives to the _Y. pestis_ have been put forward. Twigg\nsuggested that the cause was a form of [anthrax](/wiki/Anthrax \"Anthrax\"), and\n[Norman Cantor](/wiki/Norman_Cantor \"Norman Cantor\") thought it may have been\na combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued\nthat the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that they characterise as\n_hemorrhagic_ plague similar to [Ebola](/wiki/Ebola \"Ebola\"). Archaeologist\nBarney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction\nof a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval\nwaterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the\nthesis that the _Y. pestis_ was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that\ntransmission must have been person to person.[51][52] This theory is supported\nby research in 2018 which suggested transmission was more likely by body lice\nand human fleas during the Second Pandemic.[53]\n\nHowever, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread\nacceptance.[36] Many scholars arguing for the _Y. pestis_ as the major agent\nof the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a\ncombination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including\n[typhus](/wiki/Typhus \"Typhus\"), [smallpox](/wiki/Smallpox \"Smallpox\") and\nrespiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to\nadditional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne\nplague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the\nplague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and\nhelp account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.[28]\nIn 2014, scientists with [Public Health England](/wiki/Public_Health_England\n\"Public Health England\") announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies\nexhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in\nLondon during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.[45]\n\n## Consequences\n\nMain article: [Consequences of the Black\nDeath](/wiki/Consequences_of_the_Black_Death \"Consequences of the Black\nDeath\")\n\n### Death toll\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Burying_Plague_Victims_of_Tournai.jpg/220px-\nBurying_Plague_Victims_of_Tournai.jpg)](/wiki/File:Burying_Plague_Victims_of_Tournai.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Burying_Plague_Victims_of_Tournai.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCitizens of [Tournai](/wiki/Tournai \"Tournai\") bury plague victims\n\nThere are no exact figures for the [death\ntoll](/wiki/Infectious_disease#Historic_pandemics \"Infectious disease\"); the\nrate varied widely by locality. In urban centres, the greater the population\nbefore the outbreak, the longer the duration of the period of abnormal\nmortality.[54] It killed some 75 to 200 million people in\n[Eurasia](/wiki/Eurasia \"Eurasia\").[1][2][3] According to medieval historian\n[Philip Daileader](/wiki/Philip_Daileader \"Philip Daileader\") in 2007:\n\n> The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45–50% of the\n> European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount\n> of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe, areas such as Italy, the\n> south of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years\n> consecutively, it was probably closer to 75–80% of the population. In\n> Germany and England ... it was probably closer to 20%.[55]\n\nA death rate as high as 60% in Europe has been suggested by Norwegian\nhistorian Ole Benedictow:\n\n> Detailed study of the mortality data available points to two conspicuous\n> features in relation to the mortality caused by the Black Death: namely the\n> extreme level of mortality caused by the Black Death, and the remarkable\n> similarity or consistency of the level of mortality, from Spain in southern\n> Europe to England in north-western Europe. The data is sufficiently\n> widespread and numerous to make it likely that the Black Death swept away\n> around 60 per cent of Europe's population. It is generally assumed that the\n> size of Europe's population at the time was around 80 million. This implies\n> that around 50 million people died in the Black Death.[56]\n\nThe most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran\nand Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third.[57] The\nBlack Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population.[58] Half of Paris's\npopulation of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of\n[Florence](/wiki/Florence \"Florence\") was reduced from 110,000–120,000\ninhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of\n[Hamburg](/wiki/Hamburg \"Hamburg\") and [Bremen](/wiki/Bremen \"Bremen\")\nperished,[59] and a similar percentage of [Londoners](/wiki/London \"London\")\nmay have died from the disease as well.[45] In London approximately 62,000\npeople died between the years between 1346 and 1353.[11] While contemporary\nreports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large\nnumbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central\nLondon found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly\nspaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at\nthis time.[60] Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany,\nand this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450.[61] In 1348, the plague spread\nso rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to\nreflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already\nperished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the\npopulation to die.[36] The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated\nareas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially\nhard-hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.[62]\n\n### Persecutions\n\nSee also: [Black Death Jewish\npersecutions](/wiki/Black_Death_Jewish_persecutions \"Black Death Jewish\npersecutions\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Danse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png/220px-\nDanse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png)](/wiki/File:Danse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Danse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nInspired by the Black Death, _The Dance of Death_ , or _[Danse\nMacabre](/wiki/Danse_Macabre \"Danse Macabre\")_ , an allegory on the\nuniversality of death, was a common painting motif in the late medieval\nperiod.\n\nRenewed religious fervour and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black\nDeath. Some Europeans targeted \"various groups such as Jews, friars,\nforeigners, beggars, pilgrims\",[63] lepers,[63][64] and\n[Romani](/wiki/Romani_people \"Romani people\"), thinking that they were to\nblame for the crisis. [Lepers](/wiki/Leprosy \"Leprosy\"), and other individuals\nwith skin diseases such as [acne](/wiki/Acne_vulgaris \"Acne vulgaris\") or\n[psoriasis](/wiki/Psoriasis \"Psoriasis\"), were singled out and exterminated\nthroughout Europe.\n\nBecause 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause, Europeans\nturned to astrological forces, earthquakes, and the poisoning of wells by Jews\nas possible reasons for the plague's emergence.[65] The governments of Europe\nhad no apparent response to the crisis because no one knew its cause or how it\nspread. The mechanism of infection and transmission of diseases was little\nunderstood in the 14th century; many people believed the epidemic was a\npunishment by God for their sins. This belief led to the idea that the cure to\nthe disease was to win God's forgiveness.[66]\n\nThere were many attacks against [Jewish](/wiki/Jews_in_the_Middle_Ages \"Jews\nin the Middle Ages\") communities.[67] In February 1349, the citizens of\n[Strasbourg](/wiki/Strasbourg \"Strasbourg\") murdered 2,000 Jews.[67] In August\n1349, the Jewish communities in [Mainz](/wiki/Mainz \"Mainz\") and\n[Cologne](/wiki/Cologne \"Cologne\") were annihilated. By 1351, 60 major and 150\nsmaller Jewish communities had been destroyed.[68] These massacres eventually\ndied out in Western Europe, only to continue on in Eastern Europe. During this\nperiod many Jews relocated to Poland and Russia, receiving a warm welcome from\nKing [Casimir](/wiki/Casimir_III_the_Great \"Casimir III the Great\").[69]\n\n### Recurrence\n\nMain article: [Second plague pandemic](/wiki/Second_plague_pandemic \"Second\nplague pandemic\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Great_plague_of_london-1665.jpg/170px-\nGreat_plague_of_london-1665.jpg)](/wiki/File:Great_plague_of_london-1665.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Great_plague_of_london-1665.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Great Plague of London, in 1665, killed up to 100,000 people.\n\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean\nthroughout the 14th to 17th centuries.[70] According to Biraben, the plague\nwas present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671.[71] The\n[Second Pandemic](/wiki/Plague_\\(disease\\)#Second_Pandemic:_Black_Death\n\"Plague \\(disease\\)\") was particularly widespread in the following years:\n1360–1363; 1374; 1400; 1438–1439; 1456–1457; 1464–1466; 1481–1485; 1500–1503;\n1518–1531; 1544–1548; 1563–1566; 1573–1588; 1596–1599; 1602–1611; 1623–1640;\n1644–1654; and 1664–1667. Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the\nretreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th\ncentury).[72] According to Geoffrey Parker,\n\"[France](/wiki/Early_Modern_France \"Early Modern France\") alone lost almost a\nmillion people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628–31.\"[73]\n\nIn England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of\npreincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4\nmillion in 1300,[74] and a postincident population figure as low as 2\nmillion.[75] By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really\ndied out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks\noccurred in 1361–1362, 1369, 1379–1383, 1389–1393, and throughout the first\nhalf of the 15th century.[76] An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of\nthe population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–1480 could have\nbeen as high as 20%.[77] The most general outbreaks in\n[Tudor](/wiki/Tudor_dynasty \"Tudor dynasty\") and\n[Stuart](/wiki/House_of_Stuart \"House of Stuart\") England seem to have begun\nin 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the\n[Great Plague of London](/wiki/Great_Plague_of_London \"Great Plague of\nLondon\") in 1665.[78]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Chumbunt.png/220px-\nChumbunt.png)](/wiki/File:Chumbunt.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chumbunt.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Plague Riot](/wiki/Plague_Riot \"Plague Riot\") in Moscow in 1771: during the\ncourse of the [city's plague](/wiki/Russian_plague_of_1770%E2%80%931772\n\"Russian plague of 1770–1772\"), between 50,000 and 100,000 people died, ​1⁄6\nto ​1⁄3 of its population.\n\nIn 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris.[79] During the\n16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of\nthe time.[80] The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it\ncontinued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the\ncountry 25 times between 1350 and 1490.[81] Plague epidemics ravaged London in\n1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665,[82] reducing its population by 10 to\n30% during those years.[83] Over 10% of [Amsterdam](/wiki/Amsterdam\n\"Amsterdam\")'s population died in 1623–1625, and again in 1635–1636, 1655, and\n1664.[84] Plague occurred in [Venice](/wiki/Venice \"Venice\") 22 times between\n1361 and 1528.[85] The plague of 1576–1577 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a\nthird of the population.[86] Late outbreaks in central Europe included the\n[Italian Plague of 1629–1631](/wiki/Italian_Plague_of_1629%E2%80%931631\n\"Italian Plague of 1629–1631\"), which is associated with troop movements\nduring the [Thirty Years' War](/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War \"Thirty Years' War\"),\nand the [Great Plague of Vienna](/wiki/Great_Plague_of_Vienna \"Great Plague of\nVienna\") in 1679.

Between 1701 and 1750, thirty-seven larger and\nsmaller epidemics were recorded in [Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople\n\"Constantinople\"), and an additional thirty-one between 1751 and 1800.[100]\n[Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\") has suffered severely from visitations of\nthe plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped\nout.[101]\n\n### Third plague pandemic\n\nMain article: [Third plague pandemic](/wiki/Third_plague_pandemic \"Third\nplague pandemic\")\n\nThe third plague pandemic (1855–1859) started in China in the mid-19th\ncentury, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people\nin India alone.[102] Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia between 1900 and\n1925 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney. This led to the\nestablishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some\nleading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the\nbacillus _Yersinia pestis_.[103]\n\nThe first North American plague epidemic was the [San Francisco plague of\n1900–1904](/wiki/San_Francisco_plague_of_1900%E2%80%931904 \"San Francisco\nplague of 1900–1904\"), followed by another outbreak in\n1907–1908.[104][105][106]\n\nModern treatment methods include [insecticides](/wiki/Insecticide\n\"Insecticide\"), the use of [antibiotics](/wiki/Antibiotic \"Antibiotic\"), and a\n[plague vaccine](/wiki/Waldemar_Haffkine#Anti-plague_vaccine \"Waldemar\nHaffkine\").

One case of a drug-\nresistant form of the bacterium was found in [Madagascar](/wiki/Madagascar\n\"Madagascar\") in 1995.[107] A further outbreak in Madagascar was reported in\nNovember 2014.[108] In October 2017 the [deadliest outbreak of the\nplague](/wiki/2017_Madagascar_plague_outbreak \"2017 Madagascar plague\noutbreak\") in modern times hit Madagascar, killing 170 people and infecting\nthousands.[109]\n\n## Names\n\nThe phrase \"black death\" (__mors nigra__) was used in 1350 by Simon de Covino\nor Couvin, a Belgian astronomer, who wrote the poem \"On the Judgment of the\nSun at a Feast of Saturn\" (__De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni__), which\nattributes the plague to a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn.[110] In 1908,\nGasquet claimed that use of the name __atra mors__ for the 14th-century\nepidemic first appeared in a 1631 book on Danish history by [J. I.\nPontanus](/wiki/Johan_Isaksson_Pontanus \"Johan Isaksson Pontanus\"): \"Commonly\nand from its effects, they called it the black death\" (__Vulgo & ab effectu\natram mortem vocatibant__).[111] The name spread through Scandinavia and then\nGermany, gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a\nproper name.[112] However, __atra mors__ is used to refer to a pestilential\nfever (__febris pestilentialis__) already in the 12th-century _On the Signs\nand Symptoms of Diseases_ ([Latin](/wiki/Latin_language \"Latin language\"): _De\nsignis et sinthomatibus egritudinum_) by French physician [Gilles de\nCorbeil](/wiki/Gilles_de_Corbeil \"Gilles de Corbeil\").[113] In England, the\nphrase \"Black Death\" is first used to refer to the 14th-century epidemic in\n1823.[114] Writers contemporary with the plague described the event as \"great\nplague\"[65] or \"great pestilence\".[115]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [_Black Death_ (film)](/wiki/Black_Death_\\(film\\) \"Black Death \\(film\\)\")\n  * [Black Death in England](/wiki/Black_Death_in_England \"Black Death in England\")\n  * [CCR5](/wiki/CCR5 \"CCR5\"), a human gene hypothesised to be associated with the plague\n  * [Crisis of the Late Middle Ages](/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Late_Middle_Ages \"Crisis of the Late Middle Ages\")\n  * _[Cronaca fiorentina](/wiki/Cronaca_fiorentina \"Cronaca fiorentina\")_ (_Chronicle of Florence_); a literary history of the plague, and of Florence up to 1386, by [Baldassarre Bonaiuti](/wiki/Baldassarre_Bonaiuti \"Baldassarre Bonaiuti\")\n  * _[Danse Macabre](/wiki/Danse_Macabre \"Danse Macabre\")_\n  * [Death](/wiki/Death_\\(personification\\) \"Death \\(personification\\)\")\n  * [_Doomsday Book_ (novel)](/wiki/Doomsday_Book_\\(novel\\) \"Doomsday Book \\(novel\\)\"), a science fiction novel written by Connie Willis\n  * [Four thieves vinegar](/wiki/Four_thieves_vinegar \"Four thieves vinegar\"); a popular French legend saying this recipe provided immunity to the plague\n  * [Geisslerlieder](/wiki/Geisslerlieder \"Geisslerlieder\")\n  * [Globalization and disease](/wiki/Globalization_and_disease \"Globalization and disease\")\n  * [Last outbreak of bubonic plague in England](/wiki/Last_outbreak_of_bubonic_plague_in_England \"Last outbreak of bubonic plague in England\") (1906–1918)\n  * [Plague doctor](/wiki/Plague_doctor \"Plague doctor\")\n  * [Plague doctor costume](/wiki/Plague_doctor_costume \"Plague doctor costume\")\n  * [Ring a Ring o' Roses](/wiki/Ring_a_Ring_o%27_Roses \"Ring a Ring o' Roses\")\n  * _[The Seventh Seal](/wiki/The_Seventh_Seal \"The Seventh Seal\")_ , a film directed by Ingmar Bergman\n  * [Timeline of plague](/wiki/Timeline_of_plague \"Timeline of plague\")\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ ABC/Reuters (29 January 2008).
