Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. _(May 2014)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this template message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal \"Help:Maintenance template removal\"))_  \n---|---  \n  \n**[GEICO](/wiki/GEICO \"GEICO\") advertising campaigns** are known for using\nsurreal humor and satire, often featuring distinctive characters such as the\ncompany's mascot, the GEICO gecko.[1] The advertising strategy incorporates a\n[saturation](/wiki/Market_saturation \"Market saturation\")-level amount of\nprint (primarily mail circulars) and television [parody\nadvertisements](/wiki/Parody_advertisement \"Parody advertisement\"), as well as\nradio advertisements. A common line used by GEICO is \"15 minutes could save\nyou 15% or more on [car insurance](/wiki/Vehicle_insurance \"Vehicle\ninsurance\").\"[2]\n\nInvestor [Warren Buffett](/wiki/Warren_Buffett \"Warren Buffett\"), chairman and\nCEO of GEICO parent [Berkshire Hathaway](/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway \"Berkshire\nHathaway\"), has stated that he would spend $2 billion on GEICO ads if he\ncould,[3] approximately double the spending in 2012, which was $1.1 billion,\nover twice that of second place [Progressive\nCorporation](/wiki/Progressive_Corporation \"Progressive Corporation\"), with\n6.8% of premiums going into commercials. In 2016, GEICO was the top spending\nbrand in the United States, with over $1.4 billion in advertising, ousting\nsecond place [Verizon](/wiki/Verizon \"Verizon\") and previous leader\n[AT&T](/wiki/AT%26T \"AT&T\").[4] However, this is offset by not paying agents\ncommissions, since GEICO uses a direct to consumer model. This has resulted in\nGEICO being the second largest auto insurer in the United States (behind\n[State Farm](/wiki/State_Farm \"State Farm\")).[5]\n\nMany of the most prominent TV ad campaigns, such as the GEICO Gecko, the GEICO\nCavemen, the Rhetorical Questions campaign featuring [Mike\nMcGlone](/wiki/Mike_McGlone \"Mike McGlone\"), Maxwell the Pig, and the GEICO\nHump Day Camel were developed by [The Martin Agency](/wiki/The_Martin_Agency\n\"The Martin Agency\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Animated advertisements\n  * 2 The Gecko\n  * 3 Maxwell the pig\n  * 4 Cavemen\n  * 5 Parodies\n  * 6 \"I've got good news\"\n  * 7 Bland salesman\n  * 8 \"Real service, real savings\"\n  * 9 My Great Rides\n  * 10 GEICO Racing\n  * 11 _TRS: The Real Scoop_\n  * 12 \"The money you could be saving\"\n  * 13 Rhetorical question campaign\n    * 13.1 Television\n    * 13.2 Radio\n  * 14 _Short Stories and Tall Tales_\n  * 15 Xtranormal\n  * 16 \"Easier Way to Save\"\n    * 16.1 Television\n    * 16.2 Radio commercials\n  * 17 \"Brighter side\"\n  * 18 \"Get Happy, Get GEICO\"\n  * 19 Museum of Modern Insurance\n  * 20 \"Did You Know?\"\n  * 21 \"It's what you do\"\n  * 22 \"Unskippable\" freeze frames\n  * 23 Fast Forward\n  * 24 Surprising\n    * 24.1 TV\n    * 24.2 Radio\n  * 25 Great Answer\n    * 25.1 Radio\n  * 26 Take a Closer Look\n  * 27 You Had One Job\n  * 28 Expect more\n  * 29 We Interrupt Your Life\n  * 30 Count on GEICO\n  * 31 A GEICO Commercial?\n  * 32 References\n  * 33 External Links\n\n## Animated\nadvertisements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Animated advertisements\")]\n\nAnimated advertisements were part of the early [GEICO Direct](/wiki/GEICO\n\"GEICO\") ads as well as the \"Dumb Things\" campaign. The 15-second long\ncommercials, animated by [Bill Plympton](/wiki/Bill_Plympton \"Bill Plympton\"),\nfeatured a curious little man walking up to an object and eventually getting\nhurt due to his curiosity of the object.[6] One of the commercials, for\nexample, involved him finding a cannon and pressing a button, causing a\nresulting cannonball to fire out and stick to his face. The original saying in\nthe commercial was \"You could still save money on [car\ninsurance](/wiki/Vehicle_insurance \"Vehicle insurance\"). Even if you made a\nfew mistakes.\"; later modified to \"We all do dumb things. Paying too much for\ncar insurance doesn't have to be one of them.\"[7]\n\n## The\nGecko[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: The Gecko\")]\n\nThe company's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian [mascot](/wiki/Mascot\n\"Mascot\"), The Gecko, an [anthropomorphic](/wiki/Anthropomorphism\n\"Anthropomorphism\") [Day Gecko](/wiki/Phelsuma \"Phelsuma\") created by [The\nMartin Agency](/wiki/The_Martin_Agency \"The Martin Agency\"), modified in 2005\nto a [CGI](/wiki/Computer-generated_image \"Computer-generated image\")\ncharacter by Animation Director [David Hulin](/wiki/David_Hulin \"David Hulin\")\nand his team at [Framestore](/wiki/Framestore \"Framestore\"). The gecko first\nappeared in 1999, during the [Screen Actors Guild](/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild\n\"Screen Actors Guild\") [strike](/wiki/Strike_action \"Strike action\") that\nprevented the use of live actors.[8] The original commercial features the\nGecko, voiced by actor [Kelsey Grammer](/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer \"Kelsey\nGrammer\"), who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters \"This is my\nfinal plea: I am a gecko, not to be confused with GEICO, which could save you\nhundreds on car insurance. So, STOP CALLING ME!\", before licking his eye.\nLater \"wrong number\" ads used [Dave Kelly](/wiki/Dave_Kelly_\\(broadcaster\\)\n\"Dave Kelly \\(broadcaster\\)\") as the voice of the gecko. In the subsequent\ncommercials with [Jake Wood](/wiki/Jake_Wood \"Jake Wood\")[9] (which portray\nhim as a representative of the company), the gecko speaks with a British\n[Cockney](/wiki/Cockney \"Cockney\") [accent](/wiki/Accent_\\(sociolinguistics\\)\n\"Accent \\(sociolinguistics\\)\"), because it would be unexpected, according to\nMartin Agency's Steve Bassett. In 2010s commercials, the gecko's accent is\nmore working-class, perhaps in an effort to further \"humanize\" him.[10] \"As\n[computer animation](/wiki/Computer_animation \"Computer animation\") got better\nand as we got to know the character better, we did a few things,\" says Steve\nBassett, creative director at The Martin Agency. \"We wanted to make him a\nlittle more guy-next-door. And he looks a lot more real than he's looked\nbefore.\"[8] [Chelsea Clinton](/wiki/Chelsea_Clinton \"Chelsea Clinton\"),\ndaughter of former president [Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\")\nand then-[Secretary of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United\nStates Secretary of State\") and 2016\n[Democratic](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party\n\\(United States\\)\") Presidential candidate [Hillary\nClinton](/wiki/Hillary_Clinton \"Hillary Clinton\"), interviewed the Geico Gecko\nin April 2013.[11] He had since became GEICO's longest-running mascot,\nappearing in more than 150 commercials as of 2017.\n\n## Maxwell the\npig[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Maxwell the pig\")]\n\nMaxwell is an anthropomorphic talking pig and recurring character in GEICO\nadvertisements. Maxwell debuted in an installment of the Rhetorical Questions\ncampaign as the \"little piggy who cried 'wee wee wee' all the way home\"\n(referencing the famous nursery rhyme \"[This Little\nPiggy](/wiki/This_Little_Piggy \"This Little Piggy\")\") being driven home by a\nfriend's mother, squealing along the way. While Maxwell was originally\nintended as a one-time character, the popularity of his debut commercial\nresulted in him being spun off into his own series of commercials which\nusually feature him as a tech-savvy, informative pig who is most concerned\nwith his GEICO-related objects.\n\n##\nCavemen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Cavemen\")]\n\nMain article: [GEICO Cavemen](/wiki/GEICO_Cavemen \"GEICO Cavemen\")\n\nA popular series of well-received advertisements uses [cavemen](/wiki/Caveman\n\"Caveman\") as pitchmen. Also developed by the Martin Agency, the ads center on\n[Neanderthal](/wiki/Neanderthal \"Neanderthal\")-like cavemen, no different from\nmodern-day individuals (outside of somewhat prehistoric facial features),\nencountering either an ad or commercial with the tagline \"GEICO: so easy a\ncaveman could do it,\" followed by their disgust with the supposed stereotype\nof caveman stupidity. The ads posit a world where cavemen are still alive and\nactive members of society in the present day, behaving and living nothing at\nall like the stereotypical caveman. The main characters presented in the ads\nare affluent, educated, and cultured, eating at fancy restaurants, going to\nexclusive parties, and seeing their therapists (portrayed in the commercials\nby two-time [Oscar](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\")-nominated actress\n[Talia Shire](/wiki/Talia_Shire \"Talia Shire\")). The humor revolves around the\nrelative normality of the cavemen's presence and their reactions to the\nstereotype represented in the ads, and their attempts at defending themselves\nfrom the stereotype.\n\nThe ads were so successful that the commercial actors are appearing in a\nsuccessful series of interactive websites written and produced by GEICO's in-\nhouse creative team at Caveman's Crib and most recently, iHeartcavemen. A\nspin-off TV series, titled _[Cavemen](/wiki/Cavemen_\\(TV_series\\) \"Cavemen\n\\(TV series\\)\")_ and starring new actors, debuted on\n[ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\") in\nOctober 2007[12] to overwhelmingly negative critical reaction. It was canceled\nafter only six episodes were aired.\n\n##\nParodies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Parodies\")]\n\nAnother common theme is misdirection, in which the commercial appears to be\nabout an unrelated product (or, in fact, may not even be a commercial),\nsuddenly changing to become a plug for GEICO. The commercials use a variety of\nfictional characters such as [Speed Racer](/wiki/Speed_Racer \"Speed Racer\"),\n[Chatty Cathy](/wiki/Chatty_Cathy \"Chatty Cathy\"), [Jed\nClampett](/wiki/Jed_Clampett \"Jed Clampett\"), and Bill Dutchess. Other\ncommercials relate to a hair loss doctor who has saved by switching to GEICO,\na nature show about a fish, workout with [Tony Little](/wiki/Tony_Little \"Tony\nLittle\"), and a soap opera of a couple who are breaking up. Another set of\nGEICO ads involved a fictional reality show called \"Tiny House\" in which\ncontestants were forced to live in a half-scale house.\n\nAn additional commercial theme is the promotion of fictional products. In 2006\nparody ads featured such products as long distance phone service, tomato soda,\nfast-food, a reality TV show, dolls, and even poking fun at the [Old\nNavy](/wiki/Old_Navy \"Old Navy\") commercials – in all cases, the parody\nportion of the ad ends with \"but it won't save you any money on car\ninsurance.\" After the GEICO slogan is heard, the commercials end with \"Why\nhaven't you called GEICO?\" Including [Wonder Glue](/wiki/Adhesive \"Adhesive\").\n\nThe parody pitch crossed over to the Caveman campaign in 2007, in a 10-second\nspot that appears to be a talking heads news interview, but features the\npopular caveman.\n\nIn response to some of the parody ads, [Seth Green](/wiki/Seth_Green \"Seth\nGreen\") and [Matthew Senreich](/wiki/Matthew_Senreich \"Matthew Senreich\")\nwrote a sketch using the character C in a parody of one of the celebrity ads\nfor their second _[Robot Chicken](/wiki/Robot_Chicken \"Robot Chicken\")_ _[Star\nWars](/wiki/Star_Wars \"Star Wars\")_ special.\n\n_[MADtv](/wiki/MADtv \"MADtv\")_ also made a sketch parodying these ads using\ncharacters of [Elmo](/wiki/Elmo_\\(Sesame_Street\\) \"Elmo \\(Sesame Street\\)\")\n(who was performed by [Frank Caeti](/wiki/Frank_Caeti \"Frank Caeti\")) and\n[Carlos Mencia](/wiki/Carlos_Mencia \"Carlos Mencia\") (who was played by\n[Johnny Sanchez](/wiki/Johnny_A._Sanchez \"Johnny A. Sanchez\")).\n\nActor [Scott Whyte](/wiki/Scott_Whyte \"Scott Whyte\") has made a series of\ncommercial parodies, calling the company, \"Schmeiko\", while performing a\nseries of impressions.\n\n## \"I've got good\nnews\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: \"I've got good news\"\")]\n\nIn another ad campaign, a character would be breaking bad news to another\n(such as a [baseball](/wiki/Baseball \"Baseball\") manager replacing a\nstruggling pitcher with a reliever), but then offers helpfully, \"I've got good\nnews: I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to\nGEICO!\" That news, of course, is of no immediate use at all to the other\ncharacter(s). Some of the ads were parodies and/or featured celebrities\nincluding, for example, [Esteban](/wiki/Esteban_\\(musician\\) \"Esteban\n\\(musician\\)\"); one featured the popular [anime](/wiki/Anime \"Anime\")\ncharacter [Speed Racer](/wiki/Speed_Racer \"Speed Racer\"). The exchange became\nparodied for a time while the ads were popular. One of the most watched \"I've\ngot good news\" spots was a soap opera parody featuring television actor\nSebastian Siegel.\n\n## Bland\nsalesman[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Bland salesman\")]\n\nIn another series of ads, a GEICO pitchman is played by actor [Jerry\nLambert](/wiki/Jerry_Lambert_\\(actor\\) \"Jerry Lambert \\(actor\\)\") in an\nextremely bland and understated way, parodying the stereotype of an insurance\nman, such as reading to a group of uninterested children from a book of fairy\ntales about insurance, watching a view of cats in the living room where a\ngecko is standing on the couch, relaxing on a hot tub with a couple, and a\nflashback about \"Honk If You Like\". In one segment, he reads a supposed e-mail\nfrom a viewer saying it would be \"da bomb\" (_i.e._ , something good), if the\nGecko would do a dance called \"[The Robot](/wiki/Robot_\\(dance\\) \"Robot\n\\(dance\\)\")\". Cut to the Gecko doing that dance smoothly and gracefully (to\nthe tune of a not-for-public-sale melody called \"Sweet World\" by a group\ncalled Omega Men,[13] which was used in the arcade video game _[In the Groove\n2](/wiki/In_the_Groove_2 \"In the Groove 2\")_) and then back to the insurance\nsalesman attempting to do the same dance, seemingly more stiffly than an\nactual robot would. The newest commercial featuring the GEICO gecko depicts\nthe Gecko receiving a business suit from the salesman, in order to present a\nmore professional appearance, but he declines.\n\n## \"Real service, real\nsavings\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: \"Real service, real savings\"\")]\n\nIn this campaign, a real GEICO customer would present his/her testimonials,\nwhile a celebrity standing next to, or behind, the customer uses his/her\nsignature styles to help get the customer's word across.\n\nSome of these celebrities included:\n\n  * [Peter Graves](/wiki/Peter_Graves \"Peter Graves\") (1926–2010)\n  * [Peter Frampton](/wiki/Peter_Frampton \"Peter Frampton\")\n  * [Burt Bacharach](/wiki/Burt_Bacharach \"Burt Bacharach\")\n  * [Little Richard](/wiki/Little_Richard \"Little Richard\")\n  * [Mrs. Butterworth](/wiki/Mrs._Butterworth \"Mrs. Butterworth\")\n  * [Joan Rivers](/wiki/Joan_Rivers \"Joan Rivers\") (1933–2014)\n  * [The Pips](/wiki/Gladys_Knight_%26_the_Pips \"Gladys Knight & the Pips\") (1952–1989)\n  * [Charo](/wiki/Charo \"Charo\")\n  * [James Lipton](/wiki/James_Lipton \"James Lipton\")\n  * [Michael Winslow](/wiki/Michael_Winslow \"Michael Winslow\")\n  * [Verne Troyer](/wiki/Verne_Troyer \"Verne Troyer\")\n  * [Don LaFontaine](/wiki/Don_LaFontaine \"Don LaFontaine\") (1940–2008)\n\nThe slogan exclusive to this campaign is \"GEICO: Real service, real savings\".\n\n## My Great\nRides[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: My Great Rides\")]\n\nIn 2007, GEICO also launched a social networking site, My Great Rides, for\nmotorcycle owners. My Great Rides is a place for cycle owners to share stories\nabout trips they have taken on their bikes, as well as post pictures of their\nmotorcycles, and comment on other members' stories and pictures. My Great\nRides was taken down on 27 February 2012.[14]\n\n## GEICO\nRacing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: GEICO Racing\")]\n\nThe number 7 car of the [NASCAR](/wiki/NASCAR \"NASCAR\") [Nationwide\nSeries](/wiki/Nationwide_Series \"Nationwide Series\") is driven by [Mike\nWallace](/wiki/Mike_Wallace_\\(NASCAR\\) \"Mike Wallace \\(NASCAR\\)\") and was\nsponsored by GEICO prior to 2009.[15][16] Commercials involving the race team\nare of a memorably disdainful young boy, played by actor Eddie Heffernan\nclaiming to be a relative of Mike Wallace and being a better driver.[17] The\nboy says, \"When people see [Mike Wallace](/wiki/Mike_Wallace_\\(NASCAR\\) \"Mike\nWallace \\(NASCAR\\)\") and the GEICO number 7 doing well, they'll think of\nsaving a bunch of money on car insurance. But when they see me, they'll say,\n'There goes Lauren Wallace; the greatest thing to ever climb into a race\ncar.'\"[18]\n\nThe commercials are sometimes presented in an interview fashion, where an\nunseen narrator speaks to the ambitious [go-kart](/wiki/Go-kart \"Go-kart\")\ndriver. \"What do you think of Mike Wallace?\" the child is asked, to which he\nresponds, \"Whatever, he's out there selling car insurance, I'm out there to\nwin.\" When questioned on his relation to the [NASCAR](/wiki/NASCAR \"NASCAR\")\ndriver, Lauren shakes his head and concludes, \"I didn't say I wouldn't go\nfishing with the man, all I'm saying is if he comes near me, I'll put him in\nthe wall.\" To which the narrator questions him, \"You don't race in the [Busch\nSeries](/wiki/Busch_Series \"Busch Series\").\" Lauren replies \"Listen, [go-\nkart](/wiki/Go-kart \"Go-kart\") track, [grocery store](/wiki/Grocery_store\n\"Grocery store\"), those remote controlled boats; when it comes to Mike Wallace\nthe story ends with me putting him in the wall.\"\n\nNew ads in this lineup include Lauren referring to himself as being, \"100\nmiles away and ready to strike,\" and \"lightning in a bottle.\"\n\nThe success of those ads resulted in the launch of an interactive website\nwritten and produced by GEICO's in-house creative team at GEICO Garage. The\nsite includes cameo appearances by Lauren Wallace and drivers Mike Wallace,\nhis daughter [Chrissy Wallace](/wiki/Chrissy_Wallace \"Chrissy Wallace\"),\n[Speed TV](/wiki/Speed_TV \"Speed TV\")'s [Tommy Kendall](/wiki/Tommy_Kendall\n\"Tommy Kendall\"), [Paul Tracy](/wiki/Paul_Tracy \"Paul Tracy\"), [Christian\nFittipaldi](/wiki/Christian_Fittipaldi \"Christian Fittipaldi\") and [Max\nPapis](/wiki/Max_Papis \"Max Papis\").\n\n## _TRS: The Real\nScoop_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: TRS: The Real Scoop\")]\n\nIntroduced in 2 August 2007, this series of ads features an _[E! True\nHollywood Story](/wiki/E!_True_Hollywood_Story \"E! True Hollywood Story\")_\n-type show about famed fictional characters such as [Fred\nFlintstone](/wiki/Fred_Flintstone \"Fred Flintstone\"), [Jed\nClampett](/wiki/Jed_Clampett \"Jed Clampett\"), and even a [Cabbage Patch\nKid](/wiki/Cabbage_Patch_Kids \"Cabbage Patch Kids\") named Ben Winkler claiming\nto have their cars (the Flintmobile, Jed's 1923 [Oldsmobile](/wiki/Oldsmobile\n\"Oldsmobile\") truck, and a [Plymouth Reliant/Dodge\nAries](/wiki/Plymouth_Reliant \"Plymouth Reliant\"), respectively) insured by\nGEICO, featuring interviews with made-up investigators (however, the Ben\nWinkler spot does not have an interview). These commercials were voiced over\nby narrator David O'Brien.\n\n## \"The money you could be\nsaving\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: \"The money you could be saving\"\")]\n\nStarting in 2008, GEICO has aired a series of TV ads featuring two paper-\nbanded stacks of U.S. bills with a pair of big, [googly\neyes](/wiki/Googly_eyes \"Googly eyes\") on top. Kash, who never says anything,\njust sits and stares at people (in a manner intended to be unsettling), set to\na remix of a Rockwell/Michael Jackson song, \"[Somebody's Watching\nMe](/wiki/Somebody%27s_Watching_Me \"Somebody's Watching Me\")\" by [Mysto &\nPizzi](/wiki/Mysto_%26_Pizzi \"Mysto & Pizzi\").\n\n## Rhetorical question\ncampaign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Rhetorical question campaign\")]\n\nToward the end of 2009 until mid 2012, GEICO introduced another advertising\ncampaign in which [Mike McGlone](/wiki/Mike_McGlone \"Mike McGlone\") walks into\nan empty room and queries the viewer, \"Could switching to GEICO really save\nyou 15% or more on car insurance?\" After this, he pauses and then asks a\nrhetorical and/or obvious question which is immediately followed by a scene\ncut to the subject at hand. Such questions have included (in no particular\norder):\n\n###\nTelevision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=GEICO_advertising_campaigns&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Television\")]\n\n  * **Is[Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones](/wiki/Ed_%22Too_Tall%22_Jones \"Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones\") too tall?**: (Cuts to Jones in a doctor's office being measured for his height, even though he is too tall for the maximum length of the measure. The nurse then says, \"I'm just gonna guesstimate.\")\n  * **Does[Charlie Daniels](/wiki/Charlie_Daniels \"Charlie Daniels\") play a mean fiddle?**: (Cuts to Daniels energetically playing a fiddle in a classy restaurant after taking it from a violinist.

He looks disdainfully at the camera, then activates the fireplace by remote control before scowling at the camera once more.)\n  * **Was[Abe Lincoln](/wiki/Abe_Lincoln \"Abe Lincoln\") honest?**: (Cuts to an old-style black and white film of [Mary Todd Lincoln](/wiki/Mary_Todd_Lincoln \"Mary Todd Lincoln\") asking \"Does this dress make my backside look big?\" After a lengthy pause and deliberation, Lincoln sheepishly responds, saying \"Perhaps a ...\", interrupted as she gets up and walks out perturbed.)\n  * **Is having a snowball fight with pitching great[Randy Johnson](/wiki/Randy_Johnson \"Randy Johnson\") a bad idea?**: (Cuts to Johnson helping a man to his feet, the latter with a hole in the arm of his jacket, in a snowy street.
