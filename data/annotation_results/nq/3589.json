Wyner bought a third-acre parcel at the\ncorner of Arlington and Newbury streets and formed a partnership called The\nRitz-Arlington Trust with his father, George, and business associate, John S.\nSlater.\n\nThe trust sold $2.1 million of bonds to finance the construction of an\napartment building to be called the Mayflower. The 18-story, 201-foot (61 m)\nbrick building, designed by Strickland, Blodget & Law Architects, was far\ntaller than anything else along Newbury Street at the time. Construction had\nstarted on the second floor when Wyner was persuaded by then-Mayor [James\nMichael Curley](/wiki/James_Michael_Curley \"James Michael Curley\") to make the\nMayflower a world-class, 300-room Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which opened May 19,\n1927. Room rates were $5 to $15 per night; $40 per night for suites.\n\nAfter a hugely successful opening, the stock market crash of 1929 and ensuing\nDepression brought financial difficulties. The Wyner family funded the hotel’s\noperating losses during the early 1930s, although the interest on the bonds\nwent unpaid. Still in 1933, when only 30 guests were registered in the hotel,\nWyner turned on the lights in every guest room to give the appearance the\nhotel was full.\n\n### Decline of the first Ritz-Carlton\nchain[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Ritz-\nCarlton_Hotel_Company&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Decline of the\nfirst Ritz-Carlton chain\")]\n\nThe Philadelphia location was converted to an office building after only a few\nyears in operation. The Atlantic City hotel was sold to Schine Hotels in the\nlate 1940s, and later [Sheraton Hotels](/wiki/Sheraton_Hotels \"Sheraton\nHotels\") in 1959.[10] The New York hotel was demolished in 1951, leaving only\nthe Boston location.[11]\n\nEdward Wyner died of a heart attack on December 5, 1961.

The other years it\nbroke even, but from a public relations standpoint for CC&F, it was a\ntremendous asset,” said Blakeley, who completed a 19-story Ritz-Carlton luxury\n[condominium](/wiki/Condominium \"Condominium\") complex on land adjacent to the\nhotel in 1981.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn the late 1960s Blakeley obtained the rights to the Ritz-Carlton name in\nNorth America (with the exception of Montreal and New York). In June 1978,\nBlakeley was awarded the rights and privileges of the Ritz-Carlton trademark\nin the United States and was given a US Service Mark Registration.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ritz-Carlton name was licensed to the builders of a new\nhotel in Chicago. [The Ritz-Carlton Chicago](/wiki/The_Ritz-Carlton_Chicago\n\"The Ritz-Carlton Chicago\") opened in 1975 in a tower atop Water Tower Place.\nIt joined the [Four Seasons Hotels &\nResorts](/wiki/Four_Seasons_Hotels_%26_Resorts \"Four Seasons Hotels &\nResorts\") chain in 1977, as there was no Ritz-Carlton chain at the time.\nConfusingly, it remained part of Four Seasons for decades, marketed as \"The\nRitz-Carlton Chicago (A Four Seasons Hotel)\". It had no association with the\nmodern Ritz-Carlton chain, though it used the name and the iconic logo. The\nproperty was sold in 2013 and left Four Seasons, joining the modern Ritz-\nCarlton chain as a franchise on August 1, 2015.[12]\n\nIn 1982, Blakely licensed the name to hotelier John B. Coleman for two hotels\nhe was renovating, [The Fairfax](/wiki/The_Fairfax_at_Embassy_Row \"The Fairfax\nat Embassy Row\") in Washington, D.C. and the Navarro in New York City. Coleman\nrenamed them The Ritz-Carlton Washington D.C. and The Ritz-Carlton New York in\nApril 1982. Coleman paid Blakely a fee of 1.5 percent of each hotel's annual\ngross revenue for use of the name.[13] The two hotels eventually joined the\nmodern chain that would be founded a few years later.\n\n## Current company[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Ritz-\nCarlton_Hotel_Company&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Current company\")]\n\nIn August 1983, Blakeley sold The Ritz-Carlton Boston and the US trademark for\n$75.5 million to developer William B. Johnson,[14] who assembled a four-person\ndevelopment team in Atlanta, headed by hotelier Horst Schulze,[15] to create\nThe Ritz-Carlton concept and established The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co.\n\nIn 1988, Johnson subsequently obtained the exclusive rights to The Ritz-\nCarlton name throughout the world except for the 210-room Hotel-Ritz Paris,\nThe Ritz-Carlton at Water Tower Place in Chicago, and The Ritz-Carlton in\nMontreal.\n\n### The corporate years: 1983–1999[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Ritz-\nCarlton_Hotel_Company&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: The corporate\nyears: 1983–1999\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Wolfsburg7.jpg/220px-\nWolfsburg7.jpg)](/wiki/File:Wolfsburg7.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Wolfsburg7.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton at the [Autostadt](/wiki/Autostadt \"Autostadt\") in\n[Wolfsburg](/wiki/Wolfsburg \"Wolfsburg\"), [Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\"):\ncompleted in 2000, it was the first hotel of the company to open in Europe.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1975, The Ritz-Carlton Boston had been one of only two Ritz-\nCarlton hotels in the US. The other was the independently owned [Ritz-Carlton\nAtlantic City](/wiki/Ritz-Carlton_Atlantic_City \"Ritz-Carlton Atlantic City\")\nwhich had since been converted to condominiums. Johnson's company paid the\nAtlantic City establishment to abandon its name and rename itself The Ritz\nCondominiums.[10]\n\nJohnson would later enlarge the company from just the Boston property to 30\nhotels worldwide in just 10 years. He obtained financing to do so from\nManufacturers Hanover Trust of New York in 1983 in the amount of $85 million\nsecured by The Ritz-Carlton Boston. This loan was refinanced in 1989 by\nManhattan Tops USA of New York for $136.5 million and again in 1994 by\nSumitomo Bank of Japan. By 1996, this mortgage was in default and the interest\nand penalties brought the total debt to $214.8 million.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] By\nsplitting this mortgage note into three parts, Sumitomo Bank was able to\nunbundle The Ritz-Carlton Boston from the trademark rights to The Ritz-Carlton\nbrand worldwide.\n\nBlackstone Real Estate Acquisitions of New York bought The Ritz-Carlton Boston\nat auction for $75 million in February 1998. A month later, [Marriott\nInternational](/wiki/Marriott_International \"Marriott International\") of\n[Bethesda, Maryland](/wiki/Bethesda,_Maryland \"Bethesda, Maryland\"), acquired\nthe[_[where?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_\\(geographic_names\\)\n\"Wikipedia:Naming conventions \\(geographic names\\)\")_]hotel from Blackstone\nfor $100 million. Marriott, which franchises and manages Marriott’s 325,000\nrooms, then bought The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. and rights to The Ritz-Carlton\nname worldwide from W.B. Johnson for $290 million in a two-part transaction\ncompleted in 1998.\n\n### Disposal of the historic Boston\nproperty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Ritz-\nCarlton_Hotel_Company&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Disposal of the\nhistoric Boston property\")]\n\nIn 1998, Christopher Jeffries, founding partner of Millennium Partners,\nobtained The Ritz-Carlton franchises from Marriott for four hotel properties\nunder construction: two in Washington, one in [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), and one in [Atlanta,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Atlanta \"Atlanta\"). In addition, Jeffries was searching for a\nbrand affiliation for the new 155-room hotel and 270-luxury condominiums he\nwas constructing as part of Boston’s 1,800,000-square-foot (170,000 m2)\nMillennium Place, a mixed-use complex on lower Washington Street. Due to\nnoncompetition clauses, the only way he could obtain a second Ritz-Carlton\nflag in Boston was to own the existing Ritz-Carlton.\n\nMillennium Partners acquired the original Ritz-Carlton Boston for $122 million\n(though it had sold for just $75 million less than two years prior) and spent\n$50 million for renovations. Marriott agreed to allow The Ritz-Carlton\naffiliation for the condominium complex, known as The Residences at The Ritz-\nCarlton, sharing all of the services of the hotel.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Boston was home to two Ritz-Carlton hotels that faced each\nother across Boston Common. The Ritz-Carlton, Boston Common opened in 2001.\n\nIn November 2006, [Taj Hotels](/wiki/Taj_Hotels \"Taj Hotels\"), a subsidiary of\nthe India-based [Tata Group](/wiki/Tata_Group \"Tata Group\"), purchased The\nRitz-Carlton Boston from its owners, Millennium Partners for $170 million.
