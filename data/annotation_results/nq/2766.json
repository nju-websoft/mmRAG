(**RBI**)\n([IAST](/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration\n\"International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\"): _Bhāratīya Rijarva\nBaiṃka_) is India's [central banking](/wiki/Central_bank \"Central bank\")\ninstitution, which controls the [monetary policy](/wiki/Monetary_policy\n\"Monetary policy\") of the [Indian rupee](/wiki/Indian_rupee \"Indian

original share capital was divided into shares\nof 100 each fully paid, which were initially owned entirely by private\nshareholders.[7] Following India's independence on 15 August 1947, the RBI was\nnationalised on 1 January 1949.[8]\n\nThe RBI plays an important part in the Development Strategy of the [Government\nof India](/wiki/Government_of_India \"Government of India\"). It is a member\nbank of the [Asian Clearing Union](/wiki/Asian_Clearing_Union \"Asian Clearing\nUnion\"). The general superintendence and direction of the RBI is entrusted\nwith the 21-member central board of directors: the\n[governor](/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Reserve_Bank_of_India \"List of Governors\nof Reserve Bank of India\"); four deputy governors; two [finance\nministry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_\\(India\\) \"Ministry of Finance \\(India\\)\")\nrepresentatives (usually the [Economic Affairs\nSecretary](/wiki/Secretary_to_Government_of_India \"Secretary to Government of\nIndia\") and the [Financial Services\nSecretary](/wiki/Secretary_to_Government_of_India \"Secretary to Government of\nIndia\")); ten government-nominated directors to represent important elements\nof India's economy; and four directors to represent local boards headquartered\nat Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and the capital New Delhi. Each of these local\nboards consists of five members who represent regional interests, the\ninterests of co-operative and indigenous banks.\n\nThe central bank was an independent apex monetary authority which regulates\nbanks and provides important financial services like storing of foreign\nexchange reserves, control of inflation, monetary policy report till August\n2016. A central bank is known by different names in different countries. The\nfunctions of a central bank vary from country to country and are autonomous or\nquasi-autonomous body and perform or through another agency vital monetary\nfunctions in the country. A central bank is a vital financial apex institution\nof an economy and the key objects of central banks may differ from country to\ncountry still they perform activities and functions with the goal of\nmaintaining economic stability and growth of an economy.[9]\n\nThe bank is also active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a\nleading member of the [Alliance for Financial\nInclusion](/wiki/Alliance_for_Financial_Inclusion \"Alliance for Financial\nInclusion\") (AFI). The bank is often referred to by the name **Mint\nStreet**.[10] RBI is also known as banker's bank.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Preamble\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 1935–1950\n    * 2.2 1950–1960\n    * 2.3 1960–1969\n    * 2.4 1969–1985\n    * 2.5 1985–1991\n    * 2.6 1991–2000 the new century\n    * 2.7 Since 2000\n  * 3 Structure\n  * 4 Branches and support bodies\n  * 5 Functions\n    * 5.1 Financial Supervision\n    * 5.2 Regulator and supervisor of the financial system\n    * 5.3 Regulator and Supervisor of the Payment and Settlement Systems\n    * 5.4 Banker and Debt Manager to Government\n    * 5.5 Managing foreign exchange\n    * 5.6 Issue of currency\n    * 5.7 Banker's bank\n    * 5.8 Regulator of the Banking System\n    * 5.9 Detection of fake currency\n    * 5.10 Developmental role\n    * 5.11 Related functions\n    * 5.12 Custodian to foreign exchange\n  * 6 2016 Demonetisation\n    * 6.1 Cash crunch and effects\n  * 7 Policy Rates and Reserve Ratios\n    * 7.1 Repo Rate\n    * 7.2 Reverse Repo Rate (RRR)\n    * 7.3 Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)\n    * 7.4 Bank Rate\n    * 7.5 Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)\n    * 7.6 Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)\n    * 7.7 Open Market Operation (OMO)\n    * 7.8 Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)\n  * 8 Qualitative Tools\n    * 8.1 Margin Requirements or LTV\n    * 8.2 Selective credit control\n    * 8.3 Moral Suasion\n  * 9 Limitations of Monetary Policy\n  * 10 Publications\n  * 11 Further reading\n  * 12 References\n  * 13 External links\n\n##\nPreamble[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Preamble\")]\n\nThe preamble of the Reserve Bank of India describes the basic functions of the\nreserve bank as:\n\n> \"to regulate the issue of Bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to\n> securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency\n> and credit system of the country to its advantage; to have a modern monetary\n> policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy,\n> to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth.\"\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India was established following the Reserve Bank of India\nAct of 1934.[11] Though privately owned initially, it was nationalised in 1949\nand since then fully owned by [Government of India](/wiki/Government_of_India\n\"Government of India\") (GoI).\n\n###\n1935–1950[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1935–1950\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/IND-19a-Reserve_Bank_of_India-10_Rupees_%281937%29.jpg/220px-\nIND-19a-Reserve_Bank_of_India-10_Rupees_%281937%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:IND-19a-Reserve_Bank_of_India-10_Rupees_\\(1937\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:IND-19a-Reserve_Bank_of_India-10_Rupees_\\(1937\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nReserve Bank of India-10 Rupees (1938), first year of banknote issue.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India was founded on 1 April 1935 to respond to economic\ntroubles after the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War \"First World\nWar\").[12] The Reserve Bank of India was conceptualized based on the\nguidelines presented by the Central Legislative Assembly which passed these\nguidelines as the RBI Act 1934.[13] RBI was conceptualized as per the\nguidelines, working style and outlook presented by [B. R.\nAmbedkar](/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar \"B. R. Ambedkar\") in his book titled “The\nProblem of the Rupee – Its origin and its solution” and presented to the\nHilton Young Commission. The bank was set up based on the recommendations of\nthe 1926 Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance, also known as the\nHilton–Young Commission.[14] The original choice for the seal of RBI was The\nEast India Company [Double Mohur](/wiki/Mohur \"Mohur\"), with the sketch of the\nLion and Palm Tree. However, it was decided to replace the lion with the\ntiger, the national animal of India. The Preamble of the RBI describes its\nbasic functions to regulate the issue of bank notes, keep reserves to secure\nmonetary stability in India, and generally to operate the currency and credit\nsystem in the best interests of the country.[15] The Central Office of the RBI\nwas established in Calcutta (now Kolkata) but was moved to Bombay (now Mumbai)\nin 1937. The RBI also acted as Burma's (now Myanmar) central bank until April\n1947 (except during the years of Japanese occupation (1942–45)), even though\nBurma seceded from the Indian Union in 1937. After the [Partition of\nIndia](/wiki/Partition_of_India \"Partition of India\") in August 1947, the bank\nserved as the central bank for [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan \"Pakistan\") until\nJune 1948 when the [State Bank of Pakistan](/wiki/State_Bank_of_Pakistan\n\"State Bank of Pakistan\") commenced operations. Though set up as a\nshareholders’ bank, the RBI has been fully owned by the [Government of\nIndia](/wiki/Government_of_India \"Government of India\") since its\nnationalization in 1949.[16] RBI has monopoly of note issue.\n\n###\n1950–1960[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 1950–1960\")]\n\nIn the 1950s, the Indian government, under its first Prime Minister Jawaharlal\nNehru, developed a centrally planned economic policy that focused on the\nagricultural sector. The administration nationalized commercial banks[17] and\nestablished, based on the _Banking Companies Act, 1949_ (later called the\nBanking Regulation Act), a central bank regulation as part of the RBI.\nFurthermore, the central bank was ordered to support economic plan with\nloans.[18]\n\n###\n1960–1969[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 1960–1969\")]\n\nAs a result of bank crashes, the RBI was requested to establish and monitor a\ndeposit insurance system. Meant to restore the trust in the national bank\nsystem, it was initialized on 7 December 1961. The Indian government founded\nfunds to promote the economy, and used the slogan \"Developing Banking\". The\ngovernment of India restructured the national bank market and nationalized a\nlot of institutes. As a result, the RBI had to play the central part in\ncontrolling and supporting this public banking sector.\n\n###\n1969–1985[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: 1969–1985\")]\n\nIn 1969, the [Indira Gandhi](/wiki/Indira_Gandhi \"Indira Gandhi\")-headed\ngovernment nationalized 14 major commercial banks. Upon Indira Gandhi's return\nto power in 1980, a further six banks were nationalized.[14] The regulation of\nthe economy and especially the financial sector was reinforced by the\nGovernment of India in the 1970s and 1980s.[19] The central bank became the\ncentral player and increased its policies a lot for a lot of tasks like\ninterests, reserve ratio and visible deposits.[20] These measures aimed at\nbetter economic development and had a huge effect on the company policy of the\ninstitutes. The banks lent money in selected sectors, like agricultural\nbusiness and small trade companies.[21]\n\nThe branch was forced to establish two new offices in the country for every\nnewly established office in a town.[22] The [oil\ncrises](/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis \"1970s energy crisis\") in 1973 resulted in\nincreasing [inflation](/wiki/Inflation \"Inflation\"), and the RBI restricted\nmonetary policy to reduce the effects.[23]\n\n###\n1985–1991[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: 1985–1991\")]\n\nA lot of committees analysed the Indian economy between 1985 and 1991.

The _[Board for Industrial and Financial\nReconstruction](/wiki/Board_for_Industrial_and_Financial_Reconstruction \"Board\nfor Industrial and Financial Reconstruction\")_ , the _Indira Gandhi Institute\nof Development Research_ and the _Security & Exchange Board of India_\ninvestigated the national economy as a whole, and the security and exchange\nboard proposed better methods for more effective markets and the protection of\ninvestor interests. The Indian financial market was a leading example for so-\ncalled \"financial repression\" (Mckinnon and Shaw).[24] The _Discount and\nFinance House of India_ began its operations in the monetary market in April\n1988; the _National Housing Bank_ , founded in July 1988, was forced to invest\nin the property market and a new financial law improved the versatility of\ndirect deposit by more security measures and liberalisation.[25]\n\n### 1991–2000 the new\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: 1991–2000 the new century\")]\n\nThe national economy contracted in July 1991 as the Indian rupee was\ndevalued.[26] The currency lost 18% of its value relative to the [US\ndollar](/wiki/United_States_Dollar \"United States Dollar\"), and the\n_[Narsimham\nCommittee](/wiki/Narasimham_Committee_on_Banking_Sector_Reforms_\\(1998\\)\n\"Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms \\(1998\\)\")_ advised\nrestructuring the financial sector by a temporal reduced reserve ratio as well\nas the statutory liquidity ratio. New guidelines were published in 1993 to\nestablish a private banking sector. This turning point was meant to reinforce\nthe market and was often called [neo-liberal](/wiki/Neoliberalism\n\"Neoliberalism\").[27] The central bank deregulated bank interests and some\nsectors of the financial market like the trust and property markets.[28] This\nfirst phase was a success and the central government forced a diversity\nliberalisation to diversify owner structures in 1998.[29]\n\nThe [National Stock Exchange of India](/wiki/National_Stock_Exchange_of_India\n\"National Stock Exchange of India\") took the trade on in June 1994 and the RBI\nallowed nationalized banks in July to interact with the capital market to\nreinforce their capital base.

It also\nworks for overall economic growth of the country. The preamble of the Reserve\nBank of India describes its main functions as:\n\n> _**..to regulate the issue of Bank Notes and keeping of reserves with a view\n> to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the\n> currency and credit system of the country to its advantage.**_\n\n### Financial\nSupervision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Financial Supervision\")]\n\nThe primary objective of RBI is to undertake consolidated supervision of the\nfinancial sector comprising commercial banks, financial institutions and non-\nbanking finance companies.\n\nThe Board is constituted by co-opting four Directors from the Central Board as\nmembers for a term of two years and is chaired by the governor. The deputy\ngovernors of the reserve bank are ex-officio members. One deputy governor,\nusually, the deputy governor in charge of banking regulation and supervision,\nis nominated as the vice-chairman of the board. The Board is required to meet\nnormally once every month. It considers inspection reports and other\nsupervisory issues placed before it by the supervisory departments.\n\nBFS through the Audit Sub-Committee also aims at upgrading the quality of the\nstatutory audit and internal audit functions in banks and financial\ninstitutions. The audit sub-committee includes deputy governor as the chairman\nand two Directors of the Central Board as members. The BFS oversees the\nfunctioning of Department of Banking Supervision (DBS), Department of Non-\nBanking Supervision (DNBS) and Financial Institutions Division (FID) and gives\ndirections on the regulatory and supervisory issues.\n\n### Regulator and supervisor of the financial\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Regulator and supervisor of the financial system\")]\n\nThe institution is also the regulator and supervisor of the financial system\nand prescribes broad parameters of banking operations within which the\ncountry's banking and financial system functions. Its objectives are to\nmaintain public confidence in the system, protect depositors' interest and\nprovide cost-effective banking services to the public. The _Banking Ombudsman\nScheme_ has been formulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for effective\naddressing of complaints by bank customers. The RBI controls the monetary\nsupply, monitors economic indicators like the [gross domestic\nproduct](/wiki/Gross_domestic_product \"Gross domestic product\") and has to\ndecide the design of the rupee banknotes as well as coins.[47]\n\n### Regulator and Supervisor of the Payment and Settlement\nSystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Regulator and Supervisor of the Payment and Settlement\nSystems\")]\n\nPayment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall\neconomic efficiency. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007 (PSS\nAct)[48] gives the Reserve Bank oversight authority, including regulation and\nsupervision, for the payment and settlement systems in the country. In this\nrole, the RBI focuses on the development and functioning of safe, secure and\nefficient payment and settlement mechanisms. Two payment systems National\nElectronic Fund Transfer ([NEFT](/wiki/NEFT \"NEFT\")) and Real Time Gross\nSettlement ([RTGS](/wiki/Real-time_gross_settlement \"Real-time gross\nsettlement\")) allow individuals, companies and firms to transfer funds from\none bank to another. These facilities can only be used for transferring money\nwithin the country.\n\nNEFT operates on a deferred net settlement (DNS) basis and settles\ntransactions in batches. The settlement takes place for all transactions\nreceived till a particular cut-off time. It operates in hourly batches — there\nare 12 settlements from 8 am to 7 pm on weekdays and SIX between 8 am and 1 pm\non Saturdays.[49] Any transaction initiated after the designated time would\nhave to wait till the next settlement time. In RTGS, transactions are\nprocessed continuously, all through the business hours. RBI’s settlement time\nis 9 am to 4:30 pm on weekdays and 9 am to 2:00 pm on Saturdays.[50]\n\n### Banker and Debt Manager to\nGovernment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Banker and Debt Manager to Government\")]\n\nJust like individuals need a bank to carry out their financial transactions\neffectively & efficiently, Governments also need a bank to carry out their\nfinancial transactions. RBI serves this purpose for the Government of India\n(GoI). As a banker to the GoI, RBI maintains its accounts, receive payments\ninto & make payments out of these accounts. RBI also helps GoI to raise money\nfrom public via issuing bonds and government approved securities.\n\n### Managing foreign\nexchange[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Managing foreign exchange\")]\n\nThe central bank manages to reach different goals of the _[Foreign Exchange\nManagement Act, 1999](/wiki/Foreign_Exchange_Management_Act \"Foreign Exchange\nManagement Act\")_. Their objective is to facilitate external trade and payment\nand promote orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in\nIndia.\n\nWith increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy\narising from greater trade and capital flows, the [foreign exchange\nmarket](/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market \"Foreign exchange market\") has evolved\nas a key segment of the Indian financial market and RBI has an important role\nto play in regulating & managing this segment. RBI manages forex and gold\nreserves of the nation.\n\nOn a given day, the foreign exchange rate reflects the demand for and supply\nof foreign exchange arising from trade and capital transactions. The RBI’s\nFinancial Markets Department (FMD) participates in the foreign exchange market\nby undertaking sales / purchases of foreign currency to ease volatility in\nperiods of excess demand for/supply of foreign currency.\n\n### Issue of\ncurrency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Issue of currency\")]\n\nReserve bank of India is the sole body who is authorized to issue currency in\nIndia. The bank also destroys the same when they are not fit for circulation.\nAll the money issued by the central bank is its monetary liability, i.e., the\ncentral bank is obliged to back the currency with assets of equal value, to\nenhance public confidence in paper currency. The objectives are to issue bank\nnotes and give public adequate supply of the same, to maintain the currency\nand credit system of the country to utilize it in its best advantage, and to\nmaintain the reserves. RBI maintains the economic structure of the country so\nthat it can achieve the objective of price stability as well as economic\ndevelopment because both objectives are diverse in themselves. For printing of\nnotes, the [Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India\nLimited](/wiki/Security_Printing_and_Minting_Corporation_of_India_Limited\n\"Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited\") (SPMCIL), a\nwholly owned company of the Government of India, has set up printing presses\nat Nashik, Maharashtra and Dewas, Madhya Pradesh. The [Bharatiya Reserve Bank\nNote Mudran Private\nLimited](/wiki/Bharatiya_Reserve_Bank_Note_Mudran_Private_Limited \"Bharatiya\nReserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited\") (BRBNMPL), also has set up printing\npresses in Mysore in Karnataka and Salboni in West Bengal. In all, there are\nfour printing presses.[51] And for the minting of coins, SPMCIL has four mints\nat Mumbai, Noida (UP), Kolkata and Hyderabad for coin production.[51]\n\nWhile coins and one rupee notes are minted by Government of India (GoI), the\nRBI works as an agent of GoI for distributing and handling of coins. RBI also\nworks to prevent counterfeiting of currency by regularly upgrading security\nfeatures of currency. For printing currency, RBI has four facilities at\n[Dewas](/wiki/Dewas \"Dewas\"), [Nasik](/wiki/Nasik \"Nasik\"),\n[Mysore](/wiki/Mysore \"Mysore\") and [Salboni](/wiki/Salboni \"Salboni\"). The\nRBI is authorized to issue notes up to value of Rupees ten thousands and coin\nup to one thousands. New notes of Rupees 500 and 2000 have been issued on 8\nNovember 2016. The old series note of Rupees 1000 and 500 are considered\nillegal and just paper from midnight on 8 November 2016. Earlier 1000 notes\nhave been discarded by RBI.\n\n### Banker's\nbank[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Banker's bank\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Nagpur_Reserve_Bank.JPG/220px-\nNagpur_Reserve_Bank.JPG)](/wiki/File:Nagpur_Reserve_Bank.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nagpur_Reserve_Bank.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Nagpur](/wiki/Nagpur \"Nagpur\") branch holds most of India's gold deposits\n\nReserve Bank of India also works as a central bank where commercial banks are\naccount holders and can deposit money. RBI maintains banking accounts of all\nscheduled banks.[52] Commercial banks create credit. It is the duty of the RBI\nto control the credit through the CRR, bank rate and open market operations.\nAs banker's bank, the RBI facilitates the clearing of cheques between the\ncommercial banks and helps the inter-bank transfer of funds. It can grant\nfinancial accommodation to schedule banks. It acts as the lender of the last\nresort by providing emergency advances to the banks. It supervises the\nfunctioning of the commercial banks and takes action against it if the need\narises. The RBI also advises the banks on various matters for example\nCorporate Social Responsibility.\n\n### Regulator of the Banking\nSystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Regulator of the Banking System\")]\n\nRBI has the responsibility of regulating the nation's financial system. As a\nregulator and supervisor of the Indian banking system it ensures financial\nstability & public confidence in the banking system. RBI uses methods like On-\nsite inspections, off-site surveillance, scrutiny & periodic meetings to\nsupervise new bank licenses, setting capital requirements and regulating\ninterest rates in specific areas. RBI is currently focused on implementing\n[Basel III](/wiki/Basel_III \"Basel III\") norms.\n\n### Detection of fake\ncurrency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Detection of fake currency\")]\n\nIn order to curb the fake currency problem, RBI has launched a website to\nraise awareness among masses about fake notes in the market.\n[www.paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in](https://paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in/) provides\ninformation about identifying fake currency.[53]\n\nOn 22 January 2014; RBI gave a press release stating that after 31 March 2014,\nit will completely withdraw from circulation of all banknotes issued prior to\n2005. From 1 April 2014, the public will be required to approach banks for\nexchanging these notes. Banks will provide exchange facility for these notes\nuntil further communication. The reserve bank has also clarified that the\nnotes issued before 2005 will continue to be legal tender. This would mean\nthat banks are required to exchange the notes for their customers as well as\nfor non-customers. From 1 July 2014, however, to exchange more than 15 pieces\nof `500 and `1000 notes, non-customers will have to furnish proof of identity\nand residence as well as show aadhar to the bank branch in which she/he wants\nto exchange the notes.\n\nThis move from the reserve bank is expected to unearth black money held in\ncash. As the new currency notes have added security features, they would help\nin curbing the menace of fake currency.[54]\n\n### Developmental\nrole[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Developmental role\")]\n\nThe central bank has to perform a wide range of promotional functions to\nsupport national objectives and industries.[18] The RBI faces a lot of inter-\nsectoral and local inflation-related problems. Some of these problems are\nresults of the dominant part of the public sector.[55]\n\nKey tools in this effort include Priority Sector Lending such as agriculture,\nmicro and small enterprises (MSE), housing and education. RBI work towards\nstrengthening and supporting small local banks and encourage banks to open\nbranches in rural areas to include large section of society in banking net.\n\n### Related\nfunctions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Related functions\")]\n\nThe RBI is also a banker to the government and performs merchant banking\nfunction for the central and the state governments. It also acts as their\nbanker. The [National Housing Bank](/wiki/National_Housing_Bank \"National\nHousing Bank\") (NHB) was established in 1988 to promote private real estate\nacquisition.[56] The institution maintains banking accounts of all scheduled\nbanks, too. RBI on 7 August 2012 said that Indian banking system is resilient\nenough to face the stress caused by the drought-like situation because of poor\nmonsoon this year.[57]\n\n### Custodian to foreign\nexchange[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Custodian to foreign exchange\")]\n\nThe Reserve Bank has custody of the country’s reserves of international\ncurrency, and this enables the Reserve Bank to deal with crisis connected with\nadverse balance of payments position.\n\n## 2016\nDemonetisation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: 2016 Demonetisation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/2016_Indian_currency_note_demonetisation.jpg/220px-2016_Indian_currency_note_demonetisation.jpg)](/wiki/File:2016_Indian_currency_note_demonetisation.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2016_Indian_currency_note_demonetisation.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPeople gathered at ATM of [Axis Bank](/wiki/Axis_Bank \"Axis Bank\") in\n[Mehsana](/wiki/Mehsana \"Mehsana\"), Gujarat to withdraw cash following deposit\nof demonetised currency notes in bank on 15 November 2016.\n\nMain article: [2016 Indian banknote\ndemonetisation](/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation \"2016 Indian\nbanknote demonetisation\")\n\nOn [8 November 2016](/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation \"2016 Indian\nbanknote demonetisation\"), the [Government of India](/wiki/Government_of_India\n\"Government of India\") announced the\n[demonetisation](/wiki/Legal_tender#Demonetisation \"Legal tender\") of all ₹500\n(US$7.00) and ₹1,000 (US$14) banknotes of the [Mahatma Gandhi\nSeries](/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi_Series \"Mahatma Gandhi Series\") on the\nrecommendation of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).[58] The government claimed\nthat the action would curtail the shadow economy and crack down on the use of\nillicit and counterfeit cash to fund illegal activity and terrorism.[59][60]\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India laid down a detailed procedure for the exchange of\nthe demonetised banknotes with new [₹500](/wiki/Indian_500-rupee_note \"Indian\n500-rupee note\") and [₹2,000](/wiki/Indian_2000-rupee_note \"Indian 2000-rupee\nnote\") banknotes of the [Mahatma Gandhi New\nSeries](/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi_New_Series \"Mahatma Gandhi New Series\") and\n[₹100](/wiki/Indian_100-rupee_note \"Indian 100-rupee note\") banknotes of the\npreceding [Mahatma Gandhi Series](/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi_Series \"Mahatma Gandhi\nSeries\").

When the repo rate increases, borrowing from RBI becomes more\nexpensive. If RBI wants to make it more expensive for the banks to borrow\nmoney, it increases the repo rate similarly, if it wants to make it cheaper\nfor banks to borrow money it reduces the repo rate. If the repo rate is\nincreased, banks can't carry out their business at a profit whereas the very\nopposite happens when the repo rate is cut down. Generally, repo rates are cut\ndown whenever the country needs to progress in banking and economy. Currently,\nthe new RBI governor Sri Urjit Patel has cut the previous Repo rate to 6% for\nfacilitation of India's economy.\n\nIn its fifth bi-monthly Monetary policy review on 6 December 2017, RBI\nunchanged Repo Rate and kept at 6%.\n\nIf banks want to borrow money (for short term, usually overnight) from RBI\nthen banks have to charge this interest rate. currently, Repo rate is set to\n6% w.e.f 9 August 2017. Banks have to pledge government securities as\ncollateral. This kind of deal happens through a re-purchase agreement. If a\nbank wants to borrow Rs. 100 crores, it has to provide government securities\nat least worth Rs. 100 crore (could be more because of margin requirement\nwhich is 5%-10% of loan amount) and agree to repurchase them at Rs. 106.75\ncrore at the end of borrowing period. So the bank has paid Rs. 6.75 crore as\ninterest. This is the reason it is called repo rate. The government securities\nwhich are provided by banks as collateral can not come from SLR quota\n(otherwise the SLR will go below 19.5% of NDTL and attract penalty). Banks\nhave to provide these securities additionally.\n\nTo curb inflation, RBI increases Repo rate which will make borrowing costly\nfor banks. Banks will pass this increased cost to their customers which make\nborrowing costly in whole economy. Fewer people will apply for loan and\naggregate demand will get reduced. This will result in inflation coming down.\nRBI does the opposite to fight deflation. Although when RBI reduce Repo rate,\nbanks are not legally required to reduce their base rate.\n\n### Reverse Repo Rate\n(RRR)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Reverse Repo Rate \\(RRR\\)\")]\n\nAs the name suggest, reverse repo rate is just the opposite of repo rate.\nReverse Repo rate is the short term borrowing rate at which RBI borrows money\nfrom banks. The reserve bank uses this tool when it feels there is too much\nmoney floating in the banking system. An increase in the reverse repo rate\nmeans that the banks will get a higher rate of interest from RBI. As a result,\nbanks prefer to lend their money to RBI which is always safe instead of\nlending it to others (people, companies etc.) which is always risky.\n\nRepo Rate signifies the rate at which liquidity is injected into the banking\nsystem by RBI, whereas Reverse Repo rate signifies the rate at which the\ncentral bank absorbs liquidity from the banks. Currently, Reverse Repo Rate is\npegged to be 0.25% below Repo Rate.\n\n### Statutory liquidity ratio\n(SLR)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Statutory liquidity ratio \\(SLR\\)\")]\n\nApart from the CRR, banks are required to maintain liquid assets in the form\nof gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces\ncommercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid\nform and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is\nan anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts the bank funds\nfrom loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities.\nIn well-developed economies, central banks use open market operations—buying\nand selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market—to\ninfluence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence\nthe volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and\nindustrial sectors. In the open money market, government securities are traded\nat market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting more to open market\noperations in the more recent years. Generally, RBI uses\n\n  1. Minimum margins for lending against specific securities.\n  2. Ceiling on the amounts of credit for certain purposes.\n  3. The discriminatory rate of interest charged on certain types of advances.\n\nDirect credit controls in India are of three types:\n\n  1. Part of the interest rate structure, i.e., on small savings and provident funds, are administratively set.\n  2. Banks are mandatory required to keep 19.50% of their NDTL (Net Demand and Time Liabilities) in the form of liquid assets.\n  3. Banks are required to lend to the priority sectors to the extent of 40% of their advances.\n\nThe share of net demand and time liabilities that banks must maintain in safe\nand liquid assets, such as government securities, cash and gold. The present\nSLR is 19.5%.[85]\n\n### Bank\nRate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Bank Rate\")]\n\nIt is defined in Sec 49 of RBI Act of 1934 as the ‘standard rate at which RBI\nis prepared to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers\neligible for purchase'. When banks want to borrow long term funds from RBI, it\nis the interest rate which RBI charges to them. It is currently set to\n6.75%[86](Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2018–19). The bank rate\nis not used to control money supply these days. Although penal rates are\nlinked to bank rate. If a bank fails to keep SLR or CRR then RBI will impose\npenalty & it will be 300 basis points above bank rate.\n\n### Liquidity Adjustment Facility\n(LAF)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Liquidity Adjustment Facility \\(LAF\\)\")]\n\nLiquidity Adjustment facility was introduced in 2000. LAF is a facility\nprovided by the Reserve Bank of India to scheduled commercial banks to avail\nof liquidity in case of need or to park excess funds with the RBI on an\novernight basis against the collateral of Government securities. RBI accept\napplication for a minimum amount of Rs.5 crore and in multiples of Rs. 5 crore\nthereafter. LAF enables liquidity management on a day-to-day basis. The\noperations of LAF are conducted by way of repurchase agreements called Repos &\nReverse Repos.\n\n### Cash Reserve Ratio\n(CRR)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Cash Reserve Ratio \\(CRR\\)\")]\n\nCRR refers to the ratio of bank’s cash reserve balances with RBI with\nreference to the bank’s net demand & time liabilities to ensure the liquidity\n& solvency of the scheduled banks. The share of net demand and time\nliabilities that banks must maintain as cash with RBI. The RBI has set CRR at\n4%. 1% change in it today affects the economy with Rs. 96000 crores. An\nincrease sucks this amount from the economy, while a decrease injects this\namount into the economy.So if a bank has 200 Crore of NDTL then it has to keep\nRs. 8 Crore in cash with RBI. RBI pays no interest on CRR.\n\nLet's assume economy is showing inflationary trends & RBI wants to control\nthis situation by adjusting SLR & CRR. If RBI increases SLR to 50% and CRR to\n20% then bank will be left only with Rs. 60 crore for operations. Now it will\nbe very difficult for bank to maintain profitability with such small capital.\nBank will be left with no choice but to raise interest rate which will make\nborrowing costly. This will in turn reduce the overall demand & hence price\nwill come down eventually.\n\n### Open Market Operation\n(OMO)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Open Market Operation \\(OMO\\)\")]\n\nOpen market operation is the activity of buying and selling of government\nsecurities in open market to control the supply of money in banking system.\nWhen there is excess supply of money, central bank sells government securities\nthereby sucking out excess liquidity. Similarly, when liquidity is tight, RBI\nwill buy government securities and thereby inject money supply into the\neconomy.\n\n### Marginal Standing Facility\n(MSF)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Marginal Standing Facility \\(MSF\\)\")]\n\nThis scheme was introduced in May, 2011 and all the scheduled commercial bank\ncan participate in this scheme. Banks can borrow up to 2.5%[87] percent of\ntheir respective Net Demand and Time Liabilities. RBI receive application\nunder this facility for a minimum amount of Rs. One crore and in multiples of\nRs. One crore thereafter. The important difference with repo rate is that bank\ncan pledge government securities from SLR quota (up to one percent). So even\nif SLR goes below 20.5%(RBI/2014-15/445 DBR.Ret.BC.70/12.02.001/2014-15, dt.\n16.10.2016) by pledging SLR quota securities under MSF, bank will not have to\npay any penalty. The MSF rate is set to 100 basis point above bank rate and\ncurrently is at 6.50% as of 1.6.17.[88][_[better source\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS \"Wikipedia:NOTRS\")_]\n\n## Qualitative\nTools[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=36\n\"Edit section: Qualitative Tools\")]\n\n### Margin Requirements or\nLTV[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=37\n\"Edit section: Margin Requirements or LTV\")]\n\nLoan to Value is the ratio of loan amount to the actual value of asset\npurchased. RBI regulates this ratio so as to control the amount bank can lend\nto its customers. For example, if an individual wants to buy a car from\nborrowed money and the car value is Rs. 10 Lac, he can only avail a loan\namount of Rs. 7 Lac if the LTV is set to 70%. RBI can decrease or increase to\ncurb inflation or deflation respectively.\n\n### Selective credit\ncontrol[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=38\n\"Edit section: Selective credit control\")]\n\nUnder this measure, RBI can specifically instruct banks not to give loans to\ntraders of certain commodities e.g. sugar, edible oil etc. This prevents\nspeculations/ hoarding of commodities using money borrowed from banks.\n\n### Moral\nSuasion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=39\n\"Edit section: Moral Suasion\")]\n\nUnder this measure RBI try to persuade bank through meetings, conferences,\nmedia statements to do specific things under certain economic trends. For\nexample, when RBI reduces repo rate, it asks banks to reduce their base rate\nas well. Another example of this measure is to ask banks to reduce their Non-\nperforming assets ([NPAs](/wiki/Non-performing_asset \"Non-performing asset\")).\n\n## Limitations of Monetary\nPolicy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=40\n\"Edit section: Limitations of Monetary Policy\")]\n\nIn developing countries like India, Monetary Policy fails to show immediate or\nno results because of below factors:\n\n  1. People do not employ alternative investment options. A large section of society still depends on saving accounts, fixed deposits, Public Provident Fund for investment. Commercial banks have large deposits. RBI is not the main or even prominent money supplier for these banks. So whatever monetary action central bank takes has little or late impact on the economy.\n  2. Many people in rural areas are out of banking net and whatever RBI does has no impact on their financial activities.\n  3. Monsoon uncertainty adversely affects food production and thereby cause food inflation. Monetary Policy has no impact on food inflation.\n\n##\nPublications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reserve_Bank_of_India&action=edit&section=41\n\"Edit section: Publications\")]\n\nA report titled \"Trend and Progress of Banking In India\" is published\nannually, as required by the _[Banking Regulation Act,\n1949](/wiki/Banking_Regulation_Act,_1949 \"Banking Regulation Act, 1949\")_.
