Both his\nparents lived in [Turrialba](/wiki/Turrialba \"Turrialba\"), and as such many\nresidents consider him Turrialban.[2] His family has Afro-Caribbean and\nChinese roots, coming from [Jamaica](/wiki/Jamaica \"Jamaica\") to Costa Rica in\nthe early 1900s.[3] Solís grew up in San Pedro de [Montes de\nOca](/wiki/Montes_de_Oca_\\(canton\\) \"Montes de Oca \\(canton\\)\") and\n[Curridabat](/wiki/Curridabat \"Curridabat\"), neighborhoods of San José. He\nattended Methodist High School in San José, where he was president of the\nstudent body, before studying history at the [University of Costa\nRica](/wiki/University_of_Costa_Rica \"University of Costa Rica\"), where he\nearned a degree with academic honors in 1979.[4] He earned a master's degree\nin [Latin American Studies](/wiki/Latin_American_Studies \"Latin American\nStudies\") at [Tulane University](/wiki/Tulane_University \"Tulane University\")\nin [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\").[5]\n\nSolís has held various academic and consulting positions. Between 1981 and\n1987, he was an associate professor at the University of Costa Rica. In\naddition, he was a [Fulbright Scholar](/wiki/Fulbright_Scholar \"Fulbright\nScholar\") at the [University of Michigan](/wiki/University_of_Michigan\n\"University of Michigan\") from 1983 to 1985. During this time, Solís worked\nwith the [Arias](/wiki/%C3%93scar_Arias \"Óscar Arias\") administration and\neventually became director of the Center for Peace and Reconciliation (CPR for\nits Spanish initials).[4] From 1992 to 1995, Solís worked with the [Academic\nCouncil of the United Nations\nSystem](/wiki/Academic_Council_of_the_United_Nations_System \"Academic Council\nof the United Nations System\"). Starting in 1999, Solís worked for [Florida\nInternational University](/wiki/Florida_International_University \"Florida\nInternational University\") as coordinator in the Center for the Administration\nof Justice and as a researcher for the Latin American and Caribbean Center,\nwhere he analyzed political and social events in Latin America.[4]\n\nA writer and editorial writer, Solís has published numerous essays and books\nabout national and international affairs. In the 1990s, he wrote for _La\nRepública_ , a daily newspaper based in San José. His writing has been\npublished by Foreign Affairs Latinoamérica, Frontera Norte, Espacios and\nGlobal Governance. His writing has focused on civil society, international\nrelations, and trade.[4]\n\n## Political\nbeginnings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Political beginnings\")]\n\nWhile still at UCR, Solís joined the [National Liberation\nParty](/wiki/National_Liberation_Party_\\(Costa_Rica\\) \"National Liberation\nParty \\(Costa Rica\\)\") (PLN for its Spanish initials) in 1977.[4] Solís was an\nadviser to [Óscar Arias](/wiki/%C3%93scar_Arias \"Óscar Arias\") in the [Foreign\nMinistry](/wiki/Foreign_Ministry \"Foreign Ministry\"), working on the\n[Esquipulas Peace Agreement](/wiki/Esquipulas_Peace_Agreement \"Esquipulas\nPeace Agreement\") for which Arias would later win a [Nobel Peace\nPrize](/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize \"Nobel Peace Prize\"). Solís served as Director\nof International Relations for the PLN.[4] During [José María Figueres\nOlsen](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Figueres_Olsen \"José María Figueres\nOlsen\")'s time in office, Solís was ambassador of Central American Affairs.[5]\n\nIn 2002, Solís followed Rolando González Ulloa as General Secretary of the\nPLN, a position he resigned from the following year,[4] citing his\ndisappointment with the [Alcatel-Lucent](/wiki/Alcatel-Lucent \"Alcatel-\nLucent\") bribery scandal that many PLN leaders were involved in. In 2005, he\ndenounced the PLN for irregularities and corruption during party elections,\nalong with a host of former PLN members.[6] Solís went as far as to call the\nPLN leadership \"Napoleonic\" and \"anti-democratic\".[4] He officially renounced\nhis affiliation with the party and returned to academics.\n\nAfter the 2006 election, Solís' name began to come up in PAC circles,\nparticularly at meetings of the \"ungroup,\" an informal gathering of PAC\nofficials, led by former deputy and former Vice President of the [National\nUniversity of Costa Rica](/wiki/National_University_of_Costa_Rica \"National\nUniversity of Costa Rica\") [Alberto Salom\nEcheverría](/wiki/Alberto_Salom_Echeverr%C3%ADa \"Alberto Salom\nEcheverría\").[7] [Ottón Solís](/wiki/Ott%C3%B3n_Sol%C3%ADs \"Ottón Solís\"), one\nof PAC's founders and three-time presidential candidate, suggested that Luis\nGuillermo Solís run as a vice presidential candidate in 2010. Luis Guillermo\nSolis rejected the offer because he was working for the General Secretariat of\nIbero-America (SEGIB for its Spanish initials), and employees of SEGIB were\nnot allowed to participate in elections.[7]\n\nIn 2009, Luis Guillermo Solís began his official affiliation with PAC.[4] He\nbegan attending meetings of the \"ungroup\" in 2010. Within the party, PAC\nleader María Eugenia Venegas recognized Solís' potential and pushed for him to\nbe elevated within the party. Solís undertook several trips around the country\nto meet with national and provincial PAC leaders.[7]\n\n## 2014 presidential\ncampaign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: 2014 presidential campaign\")]\n\nSolís announced his candidacy for president on 27 November 2012. In the [PAC's\nprimary](/wiki/Citizens%27_Action_Party_presidential_primary,_2013 \"Citizens'\nAction Party presidential primary, 2013\"), he ran against [Epsy Campbell\nBarr](/wiki/Epsy_Campbell_Barr \"Epsy Campbell Barr\"), [Juan Carlos Mendoza\nGarcía](/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Mendoza_Garc%C3%ADa \"Juan Carlos Mendoza García\"),\nand [Ronald Solís Bolaños](/wiki/Ronald_Sol%C3%ADs_Bola%C3%B1os \"Ronald Solís\nBolaños\"), winning with 35 percent of the vote,[4] only 110 votes more than\nJuan Carlos Mendoza García.[7]\n\nIn October 2013, he chose [Helio Fallas](/wiki/Helio_Fallas \"Helio Fallas\")\nand [Ana Helena Chacón\nEcheverría](/wiki/Ana_Helena_Chac%C3%B3n_Echeverr%C3%ADa \"Ana Helena Chacón\nEcheverría\") as his Vice-Presidential running mates.[8] Among his aims, Solís\nclaimed he would clean up corruption, create major investments in\ninfrastructure, and shore up Costa Rica's [universal health\ncare](/wiki/Universal_health_care \"Universal health care\") and [social\nsecurity](/wiki/Social_security \"Social security\") system.[3] He also promised\nto continue initiatives to keep Costa Rica environmentally friendly.[9] He\nsaid that he would \"put the brakes\" on new free trade agreements and would\nbegin correctly administrating current free trade agreements.[10] As such,\nSolís received a tremendous amount of political support from [the country's\ntrade unions](/wiki/Trade_unions_in_Costa_Rica \"Trade unions in Costa Rica\").\n[11]\n\nOn 2 February 2014, Solís won the most votes in the election with 30.95\npercent. PLN candidate [Johnny Araya](/wiki/Johnny_Araya \"Johnny Araya\") came\nsecond with 29.95 percent of the vote.[12] Most of Solís' support came from\nthe Central Valley provinces of [San José](/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9_Province \"San\nJosé Province\"), [Alajuela](/wiki/Alajuela_Province \"Alajuela Province\"),\n[Heredia](/wiki/Heredia_Province \"Heredia Province\") and\n[Cartago](/wiki/Cartago_Province \"Cartago Province\").[13]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/PAC_Plaza_Roosevelt_2.jpg/220px-\nPAC_Plaza_Roosevelt_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:PAC_Plaza_Roosevelt_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PAC_Plaza_Roosevelt_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPAC supporters wave their traditional colors to celebrate Luis Guillermo\nSolís' victory on 6 April 2014\n\nBecause no candidate exceeded 40 percent of the vote, a runoff was scheduled\nfor 6 April, as required by the constitution. However, on 5 March, Araya\nannounced that he would abandon his campaign after polls showed him far behind\nSolís; one poll showed him losing by over 43 percent.[14] However, under Costa\nRican law the runoff still had to take place, and Solís won with over 77\npercent of the vote, the largest margin ever recorded for a free election in\nCosta Rica.[15][16][17] Unlike the first round, Solís earned a majority in\nevery province, including [Puntarenas](/wiki/Puntarenas_\\(canton\\) \"Puntarenas\n\\(canton\\)\"), [Limón](/wiki/Lim%C3%B3n \"Limón\"), and\n[Guanacaste](/wiki/Guanacaste_Province \"Guanacaste Province\").[18] When he\ntook office on 8 May, he was the first president in 66 years not to come from\nthe PLN or what is now the PUSC.[18]\n\nImmediately after the election, Solís thanked Costa Rican voters. He received\ncongratulatory notes from world leaders, including [US Secretary of\nState](/wiki/US_Secretary_of_State \"US Secretary of State\") [John\nKerry](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_John_Kerry \"Secretary of State John Kerry\"),\nEcuadoran President [Rafael Correa](/wiki/Rafael_Correa \"Rafael Correa\"),\nMexican President [Enrique Peña Nieto](/wiki/Enrique_Pe%C3%B1a_Nieto \"Enrique\nPeña Nieto\"), Venezuelan President [Nicolás Maduro](/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro\n\"Nicolás Maduro\"), Bolivian President [Evo Morales](/wiki/Evo_Morales \"Evo\nMorales\"), and the spokesperson from the French Ministry of International\nAffairs.[19] For his part, Araya congratulated Solís on his victory, calling\nfor national unity.[20]\n\n##\nPresidency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs&action=edit&section=4&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Presidency\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs%2C_Costa_Rica_04.JPG/220px-\nLuis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs%2C_Costa_Rica_04.JPG)](/wiki/File:Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs,_Costa_Rica_04.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs,_Costa_Rica_04.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nSolís speaking in 2014\n\nA little over a week before taking office, in April 2014, Solís announced the\ncreation of his [cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_\\(government\\) \"Cabinet\n\\(government\\)\"). His cabinet consists of mostly PAC members or non-aligned\ncitizens. However, two PUSC members were also added: María del Rocío Sáenz,\n[Abel Pacheco](/wiki/Abel_Pacheco \"Abel Pacheco\")'s former health minister,\nheads the [Costa Rican Social Security\nSystem](/wiki/Caja_Costarricense_del_Seguro_Social \"Caja Costarricense del\nSeguro Social\") (Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social). Delia Villalobos,\nanother former health minister, heads the Social Protection Council (Consejo\nde Seguridad).[21]\n\nSolís took office on 8 May 2014,[22] amid festive fanfare.[23] Delegations\nfrom more than 80 countries attended his inauguration at [La Sabana\nMetropolitan Park](/wiki/La_Sabana_Metropolitan_Park \"La Sabana Metropolitan\nPark\"), including [Prince Felipe de\nBorbón](/wiki/Prince_Felipe_de_Borb%C3%B3n_y_Grecia \"Prince Felipe de Borbón y\nGrecia\") of Spain, [Evo Morales](/wiki/Evo_Morales \"Evo Morales\") of\n[Bolivia](/wiki/Bolivia \"Bolivia\"), [Rafael Correa](/wiki/Rafael_Correa\n\"Rafael Correa\") of [Ecuador](/wiki/Ecuador \"Ecuador\"), and the Secretary\nGeneral of the [Organization of American\nStates](/wiki/Organization_of_American_States \"Organization of American\nStates\"), [José Miguel Insulza](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Miguel_Insulza \"José Miguel\nInsulza\").[24] Solís said, in Costa Rican vernacular, that he is taking over a\n\"weed farm\" (finca encharralada),[22] pointing out growing income inequality\nand poverty, as well as a national teachers' strike.[25]\n\n### Economic\nissues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs&action=edit&section=5&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Economic issues\")]\n\nIn 2014, President Solís presented a budget with an increase in spending of\n19% for 2015, an increase of 0.5% for 2016 and an increase of 12% for\n2017.[26] When the 2017 budget was finally proposed, it totaled US$15.9\nbillion. Debt payments account for one-third of that amount. Of greater\nconcern is the fact that a full 46% of the budget will require financing, a\nstep that will increase the debt owed to foreign entities.[27]\n\nThe country's credit rating was reduced by [Moody's Investors\nService](/wiki/Moody%27s_Investors_Service \"Moody's Investors Service\") in\nearly 2017 to Ba2 from Ba1, with a negative outlook on the rating. The agency\nparticularly cited the \"rising government debt burden and persistently high\nfiscal deficit, which was 5.2% of GDP in 2016\". Moody's was also concerned\nabout the \"lack of political consensus to implement measures to reduce the\nfiscal deficit [which] will result in further pressure on the government's\ndebt ratios\".[28] In late July 2017, the Costa Rica Central Bank estimated the\nbudget deficit at 6.1 percent of the country's GDP.[29]\n\nA 2017 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\nwarned that reducing the foreign debt must be a very high priority for the\ngovernment. Other fiscal reforms were also recommended to moderate the budget\ndeficit.[30]\n\n#### Liquidity\nproblems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs&action=edit&section=6&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Liquidity problems\")]\n\nIn early August 2017, the President promised admitted that the country was\nfacing a \"liquidity crisis\" and promised that a higher VAT tax and higher\nincome tax rates were being considered by his government. Such steps are\nessential, Solís told the nation, because it was facing difficulties in paying\nits obligations and guaranteeing the provision of services.\"[31] \"Despite all\nthe public calls and efforts we have made since the start of my administration\nto contain spending and increase revenues, there is still a gap that we must\nclose with fresh resources,\" he said. The crisis was occurring in spite of\ngrowth, low inflation and continued moderate interest rates, Solís\nconcluded.[32]\n\nHe explained that the Treasury will prioritize payments on the public debt\nfirst, then salaries, and then pensions. The subsequent priorities include\ntransfers to institutions \"according to their social urgency.\" All other\npayments will be made only if funds are available.[33]\n\n## Political, economic, and social\nphilosophy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs&action=edit&section=7&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Political, economic, and social philosophy\")]\n\nThe past generated two different economies: one very dynamic, modern and\ngenerally oriented toward international markets, with limited possibilities\nfor new sources of employment, and the other, traditional, which created many\njobs with low pay where small and medium-sized businesses concentrated.\n\nLuis Guillermo Solís, _[Plan Rescate,\n2014-2018](http://www.tse.go.cr/pdf/varios/plan_gobierno_pac.pdf)_\n\nLike most members of PAC, Solís identifies himself as a\n[progressivist](/wiki/Progressivism \"Progressivism\"). His _Plan Rescate_ , or\n_Rescue Plan_ , outlines his political beliefs. This plan focused on three\ncentral issues: [anti-corruption](/wiki/Corruption \"Corruption\"), [economic\ngrowth](/wiki/Economic_growth \"Economic growth\"), and reducing [income\ninequality](/wiki/Income_inequality \"Income inequality\").[34]\n\nSolís claims that economic [neoliberalism](/wiki/Neoliberalism\n\"Neoliberalism\") has created too much income inequality for Costa Rica.[34]\nPast governments have avoided collecting taxes on large companies and high-\nincome earners, leading to [budget deficits](/wiki/Budget_deficits \"Budget\ndeficits\") which Solís claims his administration will fix through better\nenforcement.[34] Banks should not encourage exports at the expense of income\ngrowth among the poor, according to Solís.[34] He believes that economic\nliberalization has generally harmed women more than men because they have\ntraditionally had less access to higher-income jobs. Part of that\nliberalization, he claims, included ignoring the financial and growth needs of\nthe agricultural industry.[35]\n\nSolís supports environmental protections, which he believes Costa Rica has\nforgotten.[9] As such, Solís believes that water must be safeguarded from\nprivate development and mismanagement, something that has caused water\nshortages in many of the country's municipalities. Solís claims that he will\nprosecute violators of the Water Resources Management Bill.[34]\n\nIn addition, Solís supports increased rights for [rights for lesbians, gays,\nbisexuals, and transsexuals](/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Costa_Rica \"LGBT rights in\nCosta Rica\"). In May 2014, he ordered that a [rainbow\nflag](/wiki/Rainbow_flag_\\(LGBT_movement\\) \"Rainbow flag \\(LGBT movement\\)\")\nbe flown over the Presidential House as a show of solidarity with gays on\nInternational Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.[36]\n\nSolís is a [Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholic \"Roman Catholic\").[35] As a\npresidential candidate, he visited the [basilica of Our Lady of\nAngels](/w/index.php?title=Basilica_of_Our_Lady_of_Angels,_Cartago&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Basilica of Our Lady of Angels, Cartago \\(page does not exist\\)\"), home to\nthe Costa Rican [patron saint](/wiki/Patron_saint \"Patron saint\") [La\nNegrita](/wiki/Virgen_de_los_Angeles \"Virgen de los Angeles\"), a traditional\npilgrimage for many Costa Ricans and tourists.[35] He supports the [separation\nof church and state](/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state \"Separation of\nchurch and state\") despite Catholicism being the country's official\nreligion.[37] With regard to ethical issues, he also supports [civil\nunions](/wiki/Civil_unions \"Civil unions\"), and [in-vitro\nfertilization](/wiki/In-vitro_fertilization \"In-vitro fertilization\").[35]\n\n## Personal\nlife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs&action=edit&section=8&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Personal life\")]\n\nSolis has ten children from his previous marriage to his first wife, Nancy\nOlive Worsfold Richards (1987–2006): Monica, Cristina, Beatriz, Charlie,\nCarly, Jennifer, John, Carlos, Diego and Ignacio.[38][1]\n\nSolís is not married to [Mercedes Peñas\nDomingo](/wiki/Mercedes_Pe%C3%B1as_Domingo \"Mercedes Peñas Domingo\"), but she\nis altogether considered the [First Lady of Costa\nRica](/wiki/First_Lady_of_Costa_Rica \"First Lady of Costa Rica\").[39] He and\nPeñas, who began dating in 2006, have one daughter, Inés.[1][38] Peñas said\nthat she hopes to be active as an adviser to Solís, who called her \"[Jiminy\nCricket](/wiki/Jiminy_Cricket \"Jiminy Cricket\").\"[39] Saying that some of her\nduties as [First Lady](/wiki/First_Lady \"First Lady\") are\n[machista](/wiki/Machismo \"Machismo\"), she will nevertheless greet dignitaries\nand perform other obligations.[39] In addition to public service and\nacademics, Solís enjoys farming.[35]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Luis_Guillermo_Sol%C3%ADs&action=edit&section=9&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Romo, Jose Luis (2015-03-15).
