The game's general principles\nput it into the [Crazy Eights](/wiki/Crazy_Eights \"Crazy Eights\") family of\ncard games. The game was originally developed in 1971 by [Merle\nRobbins](/wiki/Merle_Robbins \"Merle Robbins\") in [Reading,\nOhio](/wiki/Reading,_Ohio \"Reading, Ohio\"), a suburb of\n[Cincinnati](/wiki/Cincinnati \"Cincinnati\"). It has been a\n[Mattel](/wiki/Mattel \"Mattel\") brand since 1992. When his family and friends\nbegan to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game\nmade. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to\nsell it as well. Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends\nheaded by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in [Joliet,\nIllinois](/wiki/Joliet,_Illinois \"Joliet, Illinois\"), for $50,000 plus\nroyalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to\nmarket UNO, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by\nLewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois. In 1992,\nInternational Games became part of the Mattel family of companies.[2]There can\nbe 2-10 players.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Official rules\n    * 1.1 Penalties\n    * 1.2 Two-player game\n    * 1.3 House rules\n  * 2 Strategies\n  * 3 Card and deck styles\n  * 4 Theme packs\n    * 4.1 Themed My First Uno games\n    * 4.2 Themed video games\n    * 4.3 Themed sports teams\n  * 5 Special Uno games\n  * 6 Video games\n  * 7 Variations\n  * 8 UNO: Slots\n  * 9 UNO: The Game Show\n  * 10 Similar games\n  * 11 Notes\n  * 12 References\n  * 13 Bibliography\n\n## Official\nrules[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Uno_\\(card_game\\)&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Official rules\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Baraja_de_UNO.JPG/220px-\nBaraja_de_UNO.JPG)](/wiki/File:Baraja_de_UNO.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Baraja_de_UNO.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nUno cards\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Uno.jpg/220px-\nUno.jpg)](/wiki/File:Uno.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Uno.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUno cards\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/UNO_cards_deck.svg/220px-\nUNO_cards_deck.svg.png)](/wiki/File:UNO_cards_deck.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:UNO_cards_deck.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUNO cards deck\n\nThe aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved\n(usually over several rounds of play) by a player discarding all of their\ncards and earning points corresponding to the value of the remaining cards\nstill held by the other players. Action cards (Skip, Draw Two and Reverse) are\nworth 20 Points while Wild and Wild Draw Four cards are worth 50 Points.\n\nThe deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are 25 of each color (red,\ngreen, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero. The\nranks in each color are zero to nine, \"Skip\", \"Draw Two\", and \"Reverse\" (the\nlast three being \"action cards\"). In addition, the deck contains four each of\n\"Wild\" and \"Wild Draw Four\" cards.\n\nTo start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, with the top card of\nthe deck flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to\nthe dealer's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an\naction or Wild card (see below). On a player's turn, they must do one of the\nfollowing:\n\n  * play a card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol\n  * play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card (see restriction below)\n  * draw the top card of the deck\n\nPlay proceeds clockwise around the table.\n\nAction and Wild cards have the following effects:\n\nCard  | Effect when played from hand  | Effect as first discard   \n---|---|---  \nSkip  | Next player in sequence misses a turn  | Player to dealer's left misses a turn   \nReverse  | Order of play switches directions (clockwise to counterclockwise, or vice versa)  | Dealer plays first; play proceeds counterclockwise   \nDraw Two (+2)  | Next player in sequence draws two cards and misses a turn  | Player to dealer's left draws two cards and misses a turn   \nWild  | Player determines the next color to be matched (may be used on any turn even if the player has matching color)  | Player who puts the color card down chooses the color of the new card by putting down a card of that color.   \nWild Draw Four/Draw Four Wild (+4 and wild)  | Player determines next color to be matched; next player in sequence draws four cards and misses a turn. May be legally played only if the player has no cards of the current color (see Penalties)  | Return card to the deck, shuffle, flip top card to start discard pile   \n  \n  * A player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no other card from their hand on that turn.\n  * A player may play a Wild card at any time, even if that player has other playable cards.\n  * A player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color. The player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card.[3] A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence (see Penalties) to prove that their hand meets this condition.\n  * If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. Play then proceeds normally.\n  * It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player.\n\nA player who plays their next-to-last-card must call \"Uno\" as a warning to the\nother players.[4]\n\nThe first player to get rid of their last card (\"going out\") wins the hand and\nscores points for the cards held by the other players. Number cards count\ntheir face value, all action cards count 20, and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards\ncount 50. If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, the next\nplayer in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the\nscore is tallied. If the next player has a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card, it\ncan be stacked and possibly bring the \"out\" player back into play.\n\nThe first player to score 500 points wins the game.\n\n###\nPenalties[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Uno_\\(card_game\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Penalties\")]\n\n  * If a player does not call \"Uno\" after laying down their next-to-last card and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn (i.e., plays a card from their hand, draws from the deck, or touches the discard pile), they must draw two cards as a penalty. If the player is not caught in time (subject to interpretation) or remembers to call \"Uno\" before being caught, they suffer no penalty. If a player falsely calls \"Uno\" while having multiple cards in their hand, they must draw two cards.[3]\n  * If a player plays a Wild Draw Four card, the following player can challenge its use. The player who used the Wild Draw Four must privately show their hand to the challenging player, in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards. If the challenge is correct, then the challenged player draws four cards instead. If the challenge is wrong, then the challenger must draw six cards; the four cards they were already required to draw plus two more cards.[3]\n\n### Two-player\ngame[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Uno_\\(card_game\\)&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Two-player game\")]\n\nIn a two-player game, the Reverse card acts like a Skip card; when played, the\nother player misses a turn.\n\n### House\nrules[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Uno_\\(card_game\\)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: House rules\")]\n\nThe following house rules are suggested in the Uno rulebook, to alter the\ngame:\n\n  * **Progressive Uno** : If a draw card is played, and the following player has the same card, they can play that card and \"stack\" the penalty, which adds to the current penalty and passes it to the following player.[3]\n  * **Seven-O** : When a certain card is played, the player is able to trade hands with another player or with all players. For example, the person who played the 7 card is able to switch all of their cards with another player; the player who played the 0 card is able to make every player exchange all their cards to the next player.[3]\n  * **Jump-In** : If a player has exactly the same card (both number and color) as the top card of the discard pile, they may play it immediately, even if it is not their turn. The game then continues as if that player had just taken their turn.[3]\n\n##\nStrategies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Uno_\\(card_game\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Strategies\")]\n\nA strategy at Uno may be offensive (aiming to go out), or defensive (aiming to\nminimize the value of one's hand, in the event that another player goes out,\nthus getting those points). Part of the skill of playing Uno is knowing when\nto adopt an offensive or defensive strategy.\n\nAn offensive strategy would be holding on to Wild and Wild Draw Four cards\nbecause they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out (when\nit's harder to play a matching card). However, a defensive strategy would\nadvise getting rid of such cards early, because they have a high point value.\n\nA defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the\npoint value of the hand. However, an offensive strategy would suggest playing\na 0 when the player wants to continue on the current color, because it is less\nlikely to be matched by another 0 of a different color (there is only one 0 of\neach color, but two of each 1–9).\n\nA player holding only one card is required to call out \"Uno\" or risk being\npenalized if caught. A player who calls \"Uno\" risks being the target of\nconcerted action by the other players, who may be able to use action cards to\nprevent that player from going out. Depending on the level and seriousness of\nplay, some players may deliberately avoid saying \"Uno\", in the hope of\navoiding detection and then going out on the next turn. For this reason, it is\nuseful to conceal how many cards are in your hand and to keep track of how\nmany cards every other player holds.\n\nLittle has been published on the optimal strategy for the game of Uno.\nSimulations of games may shed some light on the matter. Attempts to reduce\npoint count in a player's hands can be \"read\" by other players if too\ntransparent. This information can be exploited by other players, and it\nfollows that a mixed strategy may be more appropriate.\n\nSome work has been done into the psychology of Uno as it relates to individual\nand group behavior.[5] Players may exhibit physical tells,[6] in which a\nsubtle, often repeated, cue inadvertently reveals their state of mind during a\ngame. Alternatively, they may change their playing style, switching from an\naggressive card-shedding strategy to a more subdued one, or vice versa.\n\n## Card and deck\nstyles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Uno_\\(card_game\\)&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Card and deck styles\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Uno_Old_Deck.jpg/220px-\nUno_Old_Deck.jpg)](/wiki/File:Uno_Old_Deck.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Uno_Old_Deck.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA deck of English Uno cards from 1994. This particular deck uses the older\ncard design, where letters appear on the action cards instead of symbols.\n\nThe new Uno action cards bear symbols which denote their action, except for\nthe Wild cards which still bear the word \"Wild.\" Before the design change,\nsuch cards in English versions of the game had letters only. Especially old\nEnglish versions can be denoted by the absence of the white rim that surrounds\nthe edge of most Uno cards. Other versions use symbols and images in both old\nand new designs, especially ones with Wild cards that do not bear the word\n\"Wild\". The Xbox 360 version of the game uses the new English style of the\ncards. There are also language-free versions of the newer styles that do not\nbear the word \"Wild\" but have the same styling. There is a new version called\n\"Uno Mod\" where the cards have symbols instead of letters or numbers. This\nversion also comes in a red and white case. It is one of several \"Mod\" games\nby Mattel, the others being [Othello (game)](/wiki/Othello_\\(game\\) \"Othello\n\\(game\\)\") Mod, [Apples to Apples](/wiki/Apples_to_Apples \"Apples to Apples\")\nMod, [Phase 10](/wiki/Phase_10 \"Phase 10\") Mod, and [Skip-Bo](/wiki/Skip-Bo\n\"Skip-Bo\") Mod.\n\n## Theme\npacks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Uno_\\(card_game\\)&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Theme packs\")]\n\nThere are many different themes and versions of Uno.

Some contend that the person playing the card would win as the next player would be required to take that card from him/her. However, some say that there is an exception whereas the Super Absorbency requires a card to be drawn from all players' hands except those who are in the uno stage. Clarification can be found on the back of the SpongeBob metallic tin. (2002)\n  21. **Jump up ^** Secret Recipe (#2) Uno – Secret Recipe – Allows the player to look at another player's hand.
