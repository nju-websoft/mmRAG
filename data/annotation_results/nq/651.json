On May 31, 1924, the two governments signed an agreement\nto establish diplomatic relations, while the Soviet government renounced in\nthat agreement all privileges granted to the Tsarist government in China.[1]\nBut in 1926 KMT [leader](/wiki/Leader \"Leader\") [Chiang Kai-\nshek](/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek \"Chiang Kai-shek\") abruptly dismissed his Soviet\nadvisers and imposed restrictions on CCP participation in the government. By\n1927, after the conclusion of the [Northern\nExpedition](/wiki/Northern_Expedition_\\(1926%E2%80%931927\\) \"Northern\nExpedition \\(1926–1927\\)\"), Chiang purged the CCP from the KMT-CCP alliance,\nresulting in the [Chinese Civil War](/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War \"Chinese Civil\nWar\") which would last until 1949, a few months after the proclamation of the\n[People's Republic of China](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China \"People's\nRepublic of China\"), led by [Mao Zedong](/wiki/Mao_Zedong \"Mao Zedong\").\nDuring the war the Soviets gave some support to the CCP, which in 1934\nsuffered a crushing blow when the KMT brought an end to the [Chinese Soviet\nRepublic](/wiki/Jiangxi_Soviet \"Jiangxi Soviet\"), thus causing the CCP's [Long\nMarch](/wiki/Long_March \"Long March\") from [Shaanxi](/wiki/Shaanxi \"Shaanxi\").\nThe Soviet Union tried and failed in an attempt to make the[_[clarification\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_]\n[Hui](/wiki/Hui_people \"Hui people\") hostile to China.[2]\n\n## Sino-Soviet conflict, 1929[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sino-\nSoviet_relations&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Sino-Soviet conflict,\n1929\")]\n\nMain article: [Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)](/wiki/Sino-\nSoviet_conflict_\\(1929\\) \"Sino-Soviet conflict \\(1929\\)\")\n\nThe Sino-Soviet conflict of 1929 was a minor armed conflict between the Soviet\nUnion and the Republic of China over the [Manchurian](/wiki/Manchuria\n\"Manchuria\") [Chinese Eastern Railway](/wiki/Chinese_Eastern_Railway \"Chinese\nEastern Railway\").

Soviet forces won a decisive victory while the Kwantung\nsuffered massive casualties, with 700,000 having surrendered.

On October\n1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed by Mao Zedong, and by\nMay 1950 the KMT had been expelled from [Mainland China](/wiki/Mainland_China\n\"Mainland China\"), remaining in control of [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\").\nWith the creation of the People's Republic of China, the supreme political\nauthority in the two countries became centred in two communist parties, both\nespousing revolutionary, [Marxist–Leninist](/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism\n\"Marxism–Leninism\") ideology: the Communist Party of China and the [Communist\nParty of the Soviet Union](/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union\n\"Communist Party of the Soviet Union\").\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China, a sensitive issue\nwhich influenced the Sino-Soviet relationship emerged. As a condition of\nfighting the [Kwantung Army](/wiki/Kwantung_Army \"Kwantung Army\") at the end\nof the Second World War, the Soviet Union received usage rights of the [China\nFar East Railway](/wiki/China_Far_East_Railway \"China Far East Railway\"), the\n[South Manchuria Railway](/wiki/South_Manchuria_Railway \"South Manchuria\nRailway\"), [Lushun](/wiki/L%C3%BCshunkou_District \"Lüshunkou District\") (also\nknown as Port Arthur) and [Dalian](/wiki/Dalian \"Dalian\"). These privileges\nwere significant in the Asian strategies of the Soviet Union because Port\nArthur and Dalian were ice-free ports for the Soviet Navy, and the China Far\nEast Railway and the South Manchuria Railway were the essential arterial\ncommunications which connected Siberia to Port Arthur and Dalian. As [Mao\nZedong](/wiki/Mao_Zedong \"Mao Zedong\") thought that the usage rights of the\n[Chinese Eastern Railway](/wiki/Return_of_the_Chinese_Eastern_Railway \"Return\nof the Chinese Eastern Railway\"), the South Manchuria Railway, the Port Arthur\nand Dalian were part of Chinese state sovereignty, he required the Soviet\nUnion to return these interests to China, and this was a crucial part of the\n[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship](/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Treaty_of_Friendship\n\"Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship\"). [Joseph Stalin](/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\n\"Joseph Stalin\") initially refused this treaty, but finally made a great\nconcession, and agreed with this treaty under the various stresses of the\nperiod.[4]\n\nSince the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship resulted in the Soviet Union losing\nits naval bases in Port Arthur and Dalian, the issue that Stalin had to face\nwas to find a new ice-free port as a Soviet naval base. This issue motivated\nStalin's support for allowing [Kim Il-Sung](/wiki/Kim_Il-Sung \"Kim Il-Sung\")\nto launch the [Korean War](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\").[4] However, both\nKim Il-Sung and Stalin did not consider that the United States would intervene\ninto that war immediately, if at all. Kim Il-Sung could not sustain the attack\nagainst the US Army. When Kim Il-Sung required military assistance from the\nSoviet Union and China, Mao agreed to send Chinese troops, but asked the\nSoviet Air Force to provide air cover. As the two leaders distrusted each\nother, Stalin agreed with sending Chinese troops to Korea, but refused to\nprovide air cover.[5] Since without the air cover from the Soviet Union, Mao\nonce considered that China did not send troops into Korea, and Stalin at one\ntime decided to give up the Korea Peninsula.[5] After much cogitation, Mao\nsolely sent Chinese troops into Korea on 19 October 1950 under an extremely\nhard Chinese economic and military situation. This activity ultimately changed\nthe Sino-Soviet relationship. After 12 days of Chinese troops entering the\nwar, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported\nmore aid to China.[5] Mao sending Chinese troops to take part in the [Korean\nWar](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\") was followed by large-scale economic and\nmilitary cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and the friendly\nrelationship of the two countries changed from titular to virtual. In one less\nknown example of the Sino-Soviet military cooperation, in April–June 1952 a\ngroup of Soviet [Tupolev Tu-4](/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-4 \"Tupolev Tu-4\") aircraft\nwere based in Beijing to perform reconnaissance missions on American fusion\nbomb tests in the Pacific.[6]\n\n## Sino-Soviet split[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sino-\nSoviet_relations&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Sino-Soviet split\")]\n\nMain article: [Sino-Soviet split](/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split \"Sino-Soviet split\")\n\nFurther information: [Sino-Soviet relations during the Brezhnev\nEra](/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_\\(1964%E2%80%931982\\)#People's_Republic_of_China\n\"History of the Soviet Union \\(1964–1982\\)\")\n\nThus, in the immediate years after the PRC was proclaimed, the Soviet Union\nbecame its closest ally. Soviet design, equipment and skilled labour was set\nout to help [industrialize](/wiki/Industrialisation \"Industrialisation\") and\n[modernize](/wiki/Modernization \"Modernization\") the PRC. But the extent of\nactual support, while not insignificant, fell well below Chinese expectations.\nIn the 1960s, relations became deeply strained following the [Sino-Soviet\nSplit](/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Split \"Sino-Soviet Split\"), culminating in the [Sino-\nSoviet border conflict](/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict \"Sino-Soviet border\nconflict\") in 1969. Increasingly, the PRC began to consider the Soviet Union,\nwhich it viewed as [Social imperialist](/wiki/Social-imperialism \"Social-\nimperialism\"), as the greatest threat it faced. In turn, overtures were made\nbetween the PRC and the US, such as in the [Ping Pong\nDiplomacy](/wiki/Ping_Pong_Diplomacy \"Ping Pong Diplomacy\") and the [1972\nNixon visit to China](/wiki/1972_Nixon_visit_to_China \"1972 Nixon visit to\nChina\").\n\nThe Soviet Union had encouraged [Uyghurs](/wiki/Uyghur_people \"Uyghur people\")\nto rebel against China.[7]\n\n## Post-Mao era and stabilizing relations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sino-\nSoviet_relations&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: Post-Mao era and\nstabilizing relations\")]\n\nIn 1976, Mao died, and in 1978, the [Gang of Four](/wiki/Gang_of_Four \"Gang of\nFour\") were overthrown by [Deng Xiaoping](/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping \"Deng\nXiaoping\"), who was to soon implement pro-market [economic\nreform](/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform \"Chinese economic reform\"). With the PRC\nno longer espousing the [anti-revisionist](/wiki/Anti-revisionist \"Anti-\nrevisionist\") notion of the [antagonistic\ncontradiction](/wiki/Antagonistic_contradiction \"Antagonistic contradiction\")\nbetween classes, relations between the two countries became gradually\nnormalized. In 1979, however, the PRC launched the [Sino-Vietnamese\nWar](/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War \"Sino-Vietnamese War\"), a failed invasion of\n[Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam \"Vietnam\") (which had, after a period of ambivalence,\nsided with the Soviet Union) in response to the [Vietnamese invasion of\nCambodia](/wiki/Vietnamese_invasion_of_Cambodia \"Vietnamese invasion of\nCambodia\") which overthrew the China-backed [Khmer Rouge](/wiki/Khmer_Rouge\n\"Khmer Rouge\") from power.\n\nDuring the Sino-Soviet split, strained relations between China and the Soviet\nUnion resulted in strained relations between China and the [pro-Soviet Afghan\ncommunist regime](/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Afghanistan \"Democratic\nRepublic of Afghanistan\"). China and [Afghanistan](/wiki/Afghanistan\n\"Afghanistan\") had neutral relations with each other during the rule of [King\nZahir Shah](/wiki/Mohammed_Zahir_Shah \"Mohammed Zahir Shah\"). When the pro-\nSoviet Afghan communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations\nbetween China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan\npro-Soviet communists supported the Vietnamese during the Sino-Vietnamese War\nand blamed China for supporting Afghan anti-communist militants. China\nresponded to the [Soviet invasion of\nAfghanistan](/wiki/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan \"Soviet war in Afghanistan\") by\nsupporting the Afghan [Mujahideen](/wiki/Mujahideen \"Mujahideen\") and ramping\nup their military presence near Afghanistan in Xinjiang. China acquired\nmilitary equipment from the United States to defend itself from Soviet\nattack.[8]\n\nChina moved its training camps for the Mujahideen from Pakistan into China\nitself. Hundreds of millions worth of anti-aircraft missiles, rocket launchers\nand machine guns were given to the Mujahideen by the Chinese. Chinese military\nadvisors and army troops were present with the Mujahideen during training.[9]\n\nEven though Soviet leader [Mikhail Gorbachev](/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev \"Mikhail\nGorbachev\") went on to criticize the post-Maoist CCP when it allowed for PRC\nmillionaires as having lost the [socialist](/wiki/Socialism \"Socialism\") path,\nwith the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s,\nthe Soviet Union itself turned to [privatization](/wiki/Privatization\n\"Privatization\").\n\n## Dissolution of the Soviet Union[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sino-\nSoviet_relations&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Dissolution of the\nSoviet Union\")]\n\nUnlike that of the PRC, this was a much more extreme, highly unregulated form\nof privatization which resulted in massive losses to foreign speculators,\nnear-anarchical conditions and economic collapse. Thus, in the post-[Cold\nWar](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\") period, while the Soviet Union remained vastly\nmore developed (economically and militarily), in a systemic and deep way\n(_i.e._ , the PRC in 1949 was less industrialized than Russia in 1914), the\nPRC emerged in a far more favourable and stable financial position. While the\nsevere Soviet shortage of capital was new, Chinese economic and military\nunderdevelopment was not. Nor was the PRC's desperate and ever-growing need\nfor mineral resources, especially [petroleum](/wiki/Petroleum \"Petroleum\")\n[fuel](/wiki/Fuel \"Fuel\"), which the Soviet Union held in abundance in such\nAsiatic regions as western [Siberia](/wiki/Siberia \"Siberia\").\n\nSee also: [Sino-Russian relations since 1991](/wiki/Sino-\nRussian_relations_since_1991 \"Sino-Russian relations since 1991\") and\n[Russia–Taiwan relations](/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Taiwan_relations \"Russia–Taiwan\nrelations\")\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sino-\nSoviet_relations&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [China, Soviet Union: Treaty of Friendship and Alliance](/wiki/China,_Soviet_Union:_Treaty_of_Friendship_and_Alliance \"China, Soviet Union: Treaty of Friendship and Alliance\")\n  * [Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship](/wiki/Sino-Soviet_Treaty_of_Friendship \"Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sino-\nSoviet_relations&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Text in _League of Nations Treaty Series_ , vol. 37, pp. 176-191.\n  2. **Jump up ^** Frederick Roelker Wulsin, Joseph Fletcher, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, National Geographic Society (U.S.), Peabody Museum of Salem (1979).
