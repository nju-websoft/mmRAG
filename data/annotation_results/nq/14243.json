\"Enlarge\")\n\nMap of Kotte (1557-1565)\n\nThe village of Darugama lay at the confluence of two streams, the [Diyawanna\nOya](/wiki/Diyawanna_Oya \"Diyawanna Oya\") and the Kolonnawa Oya. As Darugama\nwas a naturally secure place, it was not easy for enemies to enter it. Here,\nin the 13th century, a chieftain named Nissanka\n[Alagakkonara](/wiki/Alagakkonara \"Alagakkonara\") built a Kotte (meaning\nfortress)\n\nAlagakkonara is mentioned by [Ibn Batuta](/wiki/Ibn_Batuta \"Ibn Batuta\") as\nruling in [Kurunegala](/wiki/Kurunegala \"Kurunegala\"), but other sources\nindicate that he was the Bandara (Guardian) of Raigama Korale (county) in the\nmodern [Kalutara District](/wiki/Kalutara_District \"Kalutara District\"). Arya\nChakravarthy's army was held by Alagakkonara in front of Kotte, while he\ndefeated the enemy's invasion fleet at Panadura to the south-west.[2]\n\nKotte was a _jala durgha_ (water fortress), in the shape of a triangle, with\nthe Diyawanna Oya and Kolonnawa Oya marshes forming two long sides; along the\nshorter third (land) side a large [moat](/wiki/Moat \"Moat\") (the 'inner moat')\nwas dug. The fortress was nearly 2.5 km2 (0.97 sq mi) in area, fortified with\n[ramparts](/wiki/Defensive_wall \"Defensive wall\") of _kabook_ or\n[laterite](/wiki/Laterite \"Laterite\") rock, 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) high and\n10.7 metres (35 ft) in breadth.[3]\n\nIn 1391, following the conquest of the Jaffna Kingdom by Prince\n[Sapumal](/wiki/Sapumal_Kumaraya \"Sapumal Kumaraya\") (Sembahap Perumal), Kotte\nwas given the epithet 'Sri Jayawardhanapura' ('resplendent city of growing\nvictory'). It became the capital of the ancient [Kingdom of\nKotte](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kotte \"Kingdom of Kotte\"), which it remained until the\nend of the 16th century.\n\nFrom the ramparts to the magnificent three storied buildings that housed the\nKings Palace, Laterite and clay were the main raw material used in its\nconstruction. One of the places from which the laterite blocks were mined can\nbe seen even today inside the premises of [Ananda\nSasthralaya](/wiki/Ananda_Sastralaya,_Kotte \"Ananda Sastralaya, Kotte\") (a\nlocal school).\n\nThe main features of the capital city were [3]-\n\n  * The King's palace, with walls of quartz that sparkle in the moonlight (_candrakanta pasana_) and a golden spire, with beautiful flower gardens and springs of water.[4]\n  * The three-storeyed Dalada Maligawa with Buddha's sacred tooth relic in it (Temple of the tooth)\n  * The five-storeyed \"Arama\" where sixty Buddhist Bhikkus resided, with a Sangha Raja(a high priest)as the chief incumbent.\n  * The King's Treasure House\n  * The 'Kotavehara' at Baddagana, the only Buddhist temple of the city outside the moat and rampart.\n  * The Royal cemetery at Beddagana (Veherakanda memorial)\n  * The 'Angampitiya', the military parade and training ground just inside the inner moat.\n\nThe [Portuguese](/wiki/Portugal \"Portugal\") arrived on the island in 1505 and\nwere initially welcomed by the king. But they had militaristic and\nmonopolistic intentions and gained control of the city by 1565. Failing to\nwithstand repeated assaults by the forces of the neighbouring kingdom of\nSitawaka, the city was abandoned by the Portuguese, who made Colombo their new\ncapital.[5]\n\nLike similar cities of that era, Sri Jayawardhanapura was built with security\nin mind. A rampart and [moat](/wiki/Moat \"Moat\") protected the entire city.\nTraces of this moat and rampart are still visible today at certain places.\nAlong parts of the rampart, encroachers have now built houses, garages and\neven toilets.\n\nThe [urbanisation](/wiki/Urbanisation \"Urbanisation\") of Kotte restarted in\nthe 19th century. The archaeological remains were torn up and used as building\nmaterials (a process that continues) — some of it even ending up in the\nVictoria Bridge, across the Kelani River.\n\n##\nLegislature[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sri_Jayawardenepura_Kotte&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Legislature\")]\n\nThe New [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Sri_Lanka \"Parliament of Sri Lanka\")\nwas inaugurated on 29 April 1982. The buildings were built on reclaimed land,\nafter a massive lake was formed by dredging the marshlands around the\n[Diyawanna Oya](/wiki/Diyawanna_Oya \"Diyawanna Oya\"). The new parliamentary\nbuildings were built on Duwa, a 50,000 square metre (12 acre) island in the\ncentre of the lake. The island (off Baddegana Road, Pita Kotte) had been used\nas a recreation and brawling spot for Portuguese soldiers in the last days of\nthe Kotte era, alcohol being banned from the Royal City. It had belonged to E.\nW. Perera and had housed a chicken farm prior to being vested in the state. On\n29 April 1982, the new parliamentary complex was declared open by the former\npresident [J. R. Jayewardene](/wiki/J._R._Jayewardene \"J. R. Jayewardene\").\n\nThe process of relocating government institutions from the former capital of\nColombo is still in progress.\n\n## Municipal structure\n[6][[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sri_Jayawardenepura_Kotte&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Municipal structure \\[6\\]\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Colombo_79.87379E_6.92710N.jpg/250px-\nColombo_79.87379E_6.92710N.jpg)](/wiki/File:Colombo_79.87379E_6.92710N.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Colombo_79.87379E_6.92710N.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSri Jayawardenepura Kotte is located at the south east of Colombo.\n\nThe Kotte Urban Development Council was created in the 1930s, with a modern\nbuilding at [Rajagiriya](/wiki/Rajagiriya \"Rajagiriya\").

Four separate football clubs (Lido, Welikada\nProgress, Welikada Red Star and Welikada United) once used the EW Perera Park\ngrounds at Welikada, Rajagiriya where a pavilion was constructed in the 1970s.\nHowever, when the grounds were destroyed by the [JR\nJayawardene](/wiki/JR_Jayawardene \"JR Jayawardene\") regime in the late 1970s,\nthe football clubs disappeared. Football continued to be played at the grounds\nat Obeysekerapura in Rajagiriya.\n\nIn the 1990s the Kotte Municipal Council constructed the Chandra Silva\nStadium, to replace the EW Perera Grounds. Part of the grounds was sold and\nlater used to construct the HSBC building. In 2007 the Municipality, with aid\nfrom the Ministry of Urban Development, completed the first stage of the new\nChandra Silva Stadium on the site of a rubbish dump behind the HSBC building.\n\nRecently, football has once more grown in popularity, and the sport now has a\nconsiderable following. The football association's new training facility at\nKotte is aimed at harnessing and developing the available talent and\norganizing the individual players into a cohesive team. It includes a football\nplayground with a sprinkler system, gym and a host of other facilities.[13]\n\nOther sports are mostly played in the numerous clubs and [gyms](/wiki/Gyms\n\"Gyms\"), and include tennis, squash, billiards, horse riding, indoor cricket,\nbadminton and table tennis. Horse riding can be pursued at the Premadasa\nRiding School in Nugegoda.\n\n[Coordinates](/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system \"Geographic coordinate\nsystem\"): [6°54′39″N 79°53′16.21″E﻿ / ﻿6.91083°N 79.8878361°E﻿ / 6.91083;\n79.8878361](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Sri_Jayawardenepura_Kotte&params=6_54_39_N_79_53_16.21_E_type:city)\n\n## Notable\nresidents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sri_Jayawardenepura_Kotte&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Notable residents\")]\n\n  * [Edward Walter Perera](/wiki/E._W._Perera \"E.
