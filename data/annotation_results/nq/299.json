The track was produced by [Rick Chertoff](/wiki/Rick_Chertoff \"Rick\nChertoff\") and released as a single on January 27, 1984. The song became\nLauper's first number 1 hit in the U.S. The song was written in the album's\nfinal stages, after \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", \"She Bop\" and \"All Through\nthe Night\" had been written. The writing began with the title, which Lauper\nhad seen in _[TV Guide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV Guide\")_ magazine, referring to the\nscience fiction film _[Time After Time](/wiki/Time_After_Time_\\(1979_film\\)\n\"Time After Time \\(1979 film\\)\")_ (1979).[2]\n\n\"Time After Time\" is composed of simple keyboard-synth chords, bright, jangly\nguitars, clock-ticking percussion, and elastic bassline. Lyrically, it is a\nlove song of devotion. Music critics gave the song positive reviews, with many\ncommending the song for being a solid and memorable love song. The song has\nbeen selected as one of the Best Love Songs of All Time by many media outlets,\nincluding _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ ,\n[Nerve](/wiki/Nerve_\\(website\\) \"Nerve \\(website\\)\"), [MTV](/wiki/MTV \"MTV\")\nand many others.[3] \"Time After Time\" was also nominated for a [Grammy Award\nfor Song of the Year](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Song_of_the_Year \"Grammy Award\nfor Song of the Year\") at the [1985 edition](/wiki/Grammy_Awards_of_1985\n\"Grammy Awards of 1985\").[4] The song was a success on the charts, becoming\nher first number-one single on the US [_Billboard_](/wiki/Billboard_charts\n\"Billboard charts\") [Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")\nchart on June 9, 1984, and remaining there for two weeks. The song reached\nnumber three on the [UK Singles Chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles\nChart\") and number six on the [ARIA Singles Chart](/wiki/ARIA_Charts \"ARIA\nCharts\").\n\nThe song is also known for its numerous covers by a wide range of artists,\nincluding [Miles Davis](/wiki/Miles_Davis \"Miles Davis\"), who recorded an\ninstrumental version for his 1985 album _[You're Under\nArrest](/wiki/You%27re_Under_Arrest_\\(Miles_Davis_album\\) \"You're Under Arrest\n\\(Miles Davis album\\)\")_, and [Eva Cassidy](/wiki/Eva_Cassidy \"Eva Cassidy\"),\nwhose cover of the song appears on her posthumous [album of the same\nname](/wiki/Time_After_Time_\\(Eva_Cassidy_album\\) \"Time After Time \\(Eva\nCassidy album\\)\").

Lauper\nhad already recorded the majority of the album, including the songs \"[Girls\nJust Want to Have Fun](/wiki/Girls_Just_Want_to_Have_Fun \"Girls Just Want to\nHave Fun\")\", \"[She Bop](/wiki/She_Bop \"She Bop\")\" and \"[All Through the\nNight](/wiki/All_Through_the_Night_\\(Cyndi_Lauper_song\\) \"All Through the\nNight \\(Cyndi Lauper song\\)\")\", but Chertoff insisted that she and Hyman\nneeded to record just \"one more song\". Therefore, she and Hyman sat at a piano\nand started working on \"Time After Time\".[7] The inspiration for the song came\nafter both songwriters were going through similar situations in their\nrespective relationships; he was coming out of a relationship, while she was\nhaving difficulties with her boyfriend, David Wolff. One of the first lines\nRob wrote was \"suitcase of memories\", which according to Lauper, \"struck her\",\nclaiming it was a \"wonderful line\", while other lines came from Lauper's life.\nThe song's title was inspired after Lauper started writing for the song and\nneeded a fake title as a placeholder for the time being. Thus, Lauper was\nlooking in the _[TV Guide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV Guide\")_ and saw a lot of movie\ntitles, with the 1979 science fiction movie _[Time After\nTime](/wiki/Time_After_Time_\\(1979_film\\) \"Time After Time \\(1979 film\\)\")_\nbeing chosen. Although trying to remove the title later, Lauper claimed she\ncouldn't take it out without the song falling apart.[7]\n\nInitially, Epic Records wanted \"Time After Time\" as the album's lead single.\nHowever, Lauper felt that releasing a ballad first defines an artist in a\ncertain way, noting that she could have been known as a balladeer and that it\ncould have killed her career. Her manager Dave Wolff was convinced that \"Girls\nJust Wanna Have Fun\" could be an anthem, and ultimately her label agreed and\nreleased it as the lead single.[7] \"Time After Time\" eventually became the\nalbum's second single,[8] being released on January 27, 1984.[9]\n\n## Composition and\nlyrics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_After_Time_\\(Cyndi_Lauper_song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Composition and lyrics\")]\n\nWritten by [Cyndi Lauper](/wiki/Cyndi_Lauper \"Cyndi Lauper\") and [Rob\nHyman](/wiki/Rob_Hyman \"Rob Hyman\") and produced by [Rick\nChertoff](/wiki/Rick_Chertoff \"Rick Chertoff\"), \"Time After Time\" is built\nover simple keyboard-synth chords, bright, jangly [guitars](/wiki/Guitar\n\"Guitar\"), [clock ticking](/wiki/Clock_tick \"Clock tick\")\n[percussion](/wiki/Percussion \"Percussion\"), and elastic\n[bassline](/wiki/Bassline \"Bassline\").[10] Lyrically, the track is a love song\nof devotion.[11] Pam Avoledo of _[Blogcritics](/wiki/Blogcritics\n\"Blogcritics\")_ speculates that, \"In 'Time After Time,' Lauper believes she is\na difficult person, unworthy of love. She runs away and shuts people out.\nHowever, her devoted boyfriend who loves her unconditionally is willing to\nhelp her through anything. The relationship is given depth. The couple’s\nintimacy and history is apparent. They've been together for a long time.
