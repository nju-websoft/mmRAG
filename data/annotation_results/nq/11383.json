[Citizens of the United\nStates](/wiki/Citizenship_in_the_United_States \"Citizenship in the United\nStates\") vote in each [state](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S. state\") and the [District\nof Columbia](/wiki/District_of_Columbia \"District of Columbia\") at a general\nelection to choose a slate of \"electors\" pledged to vote for a particular\nparty's candidate.[1][2]\n\nThe [Twelfth\nAmendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twelfth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") requires each elector to cast\none vote for president and another vote for vice president.[3] In each state\nand the District of Columbia, electors are chosen every four years on the\nTuesday after the first Monday in November, and then meet to cast ballots on\nthe first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.[4] The candidates who\nreceive a [majority](/wiki/Majority \"Majority\") of electoral votes among the\nstates are elected President and Vice President of the United States when the\nElectoral College vote is certified by [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress\n\"United States Congress\") in January.\n\nEach state chooses electors, totaling in number to that state's combined total\nof senators and representatives. There are a total of 538 electors,\ncorresponding to the 435\n[representatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") and 100 [senators](/wiki/United_States_Senate\n\"United States Senate\"), plus the three electors for the District of Columbia\nas provided by the [Twenty-third Amendment](/wiki/Twenty-\nthird_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-third Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution\").[5] The Constitution bars any federal\nofficial, elected or appointed, from being an elector. The [Office of the\nFederal Register](/wiki/Office_of_the_Federal_Register \"Office of the Federal\nRegister\") is charged with administering the Electoral College.[6] Since the\nmid-19th century when all electors have been popularly chosen, the Electoral\nCollege has elected the candidate who received the most popular votes\nnationwide, except in four elections:\n[1876](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1876 \"United States\npresidential election, 1876\"),\n[1888](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1888 \"United States\npresidential election, 1888\"),\n[2000](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000 \"United States\npresidential election, 2000\"), and\n[2016](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016 \"United States\npresidential election, 2016\"). In\n[1824](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824 \"United States\npresidential election, 1824\"), there were six states in which electors were\nlegislatively appointed, rather than popularly elected, so the true national\npopular vote is uncertain; the electors failed to select a winning candidate,\nso the matter was decided by the House of Representatives.[7]\n\nAll states except [California](/wiki/California \"California\") (before 1913),\n[Maine](/wiki/Maine \"Maine\"), and [Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska \"Nebraska\") have\nchosen electors on a \"[winner-take-all](/wiki/Plurality_voting_system\n\"Plurality voting system\")\" basis since the 1880s.[8] Under the winner-take-\nall system, the state's electors are awarded to the candidate with the most\nvotes in that state, thus maximizing the state's influence in the national\nelection. Maine and Nebraska use the \"congressional district method\",\nselecting one elector within each congressional district by [popular\nvote](/wiki/Popular_vote_\\(representative_democracy\\) \"Popular vote\n\\(representative democracy\\)\") and awarding two electors by a statewide\npopular vote.[9] Although no elector is required by federal law to honor their\npledge, there have been very few occasions when an [elector voted contrary to\na pledge](/wiki/Faithless_elector \"Faithless elector\") and never once has it\nimpacted the final outcome of a national election.[10][11]\n\nIf no candidate for president receives a majority of electoral votes for\npresident, the Twelfth Amendment provides that the House of Representatives\nwill select the president, with each of the fifty state delegations casting\none vote. If no candidate for vice president receives a majority of electoral\nvotes for vice president, then the Senate will select the vice president, with\neach of the 100 senators having one vote.[12][13]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Original plan\n    * 2.2 Breakdown and revision\n    * 2.3 Evolution to the general ticket\n    * 2.4 Evolution of selection plans\n    * 2.5 Fourteenth Amendment\n  * 3 Modern mechanics\n    * 3.1 Summary\n    * 3.2 Electors\n      * 3.2.1 Apportionment\n      * 3.2.2 Nomination\n      * 3.2.3 Selection\n      * 3.2.4 Meetings\n      * 3.2.5 Faithlessness\n    * 3.3 Joint session of Congress and contingencies\n      * 3.3.1 Contingent presidential election by House\n      * 3.3.2 Contingent vice presidential election by Senate\n      * 3.3.3 Deadlocked election\n    * 3.4 Current electoral vote distribution\n  * 4 Chronological table\n  * 5 Alternative methods of choosing electors\n    * 5.1 Appointment by state legislature\n    * 5.2 Electoral districts\n    * 5.3 Proportional vote\n    * 5.4 Congressional district method\n      * 5.4.1 Implementation\n  * 6 Contemporary issues\n    * 6.1 Criticism\n      * 6.1.1 Non-determinacy of popular vote\n      * 6.1.2 Exclusive focus on large swing states\n      * 6.1.3 Discouragement of turnout and participation\n      * 6.1.4 Obscuring disenfranchisement within states\n      * 6.1.5 Lack of enfranchisement of U.S. territories\n      * 6.1.6 Advantage based on state population\n      * 6.1.7 Disadvantage for third parties\n    * 6.2 Support\n      * 6.2.1 Prevention of an urban-centric victory\n      * 6.2.2 Maintenance of the federal character of the nation\n      * 6.2.3 Enhancement of the status of minority groups\n      * 6.2.4 Encouragement of stability through the two-party system\n      * 6.2.5 Flexibility if a presidential candidate dies\n      * 6.2.6 Isolation of election problems\n  * 7 Efforts to abolish\n    * 7.1 Constitutional amendment\n      * 7.1.1 Bayh–Celler amendment\n      * 7.1.2 Carter proposal\n      * 7.1.3 Current proposal\n    * 7.2 National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 Notes\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nThe [Constitutional\nConvention](/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_\\(United_States\\) \"Constitutional\nConvention \\(United States\\)\") in 1787 used the [Virginia\nPlan](/wiki/Virginia_Plan \"Virginia Plan\") as the basis for discussions, as\nthe Virginia delegation had proposed it first. The Virginia Plan called for\nthe Congress to elect the president.[14] Delegates from a majority of states\nagreed to this mode of election.[15] However, a committee formed to work out\nvarious details including the mode of election of the president, recommended\ninstead the election be by a group of people apportioned among the states in\nthe same numbers as their representatives in Congress (the formula for which\nhad been resolved in lengthy debates resulting in the [Connecticut\nCompromise](/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise \"Connecticut Compromise\") and [Three-\nFifths Compromise](/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise \"Three-Fifths Compromise\")),\nbut chosen by each state \"in such manner as its Legislature may direct.\"\nCommittee member [Gouverneur Morris](/wiki/Gouverneur_Morris \"Gouverneur\nMorris\") explained the reasons for the change; among others, there were fears\nof \"intrigue\" if the president were chosen by a small group of men who met\ntogether regularly, as well as concerns for the independence of the president\nif he were elected by the Congress.[16] However once the Electoral College had\nbeen decided on, several delegates (Mason, Butler, Morris, Wilson, and\nMadison) openly recognized its ability to protect the election process from\ncabal, corruption, intrigue, and faction. Some delegates, including James\nWilson and James Madison, preferred popular election of the executive. Madison\nacknowledged that while a popular vote would be ideal, it would be difficult\nto get consensus on the proposal given the prevalence of\n[slavery](/wiki/Slavery \"Slavery\") in the South:\n\n> There was one difficulty however of a serious nature attending an immediate\n> choice by the people. The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the\n> Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in\n> the election on the score of Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated\n> this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to the fewest\n> objections.[17]\n\nThe Convention approved the Committee's Electoral College proposal, with minor\nmodifications, on September 6, 1787.[18] Delegates from states with smaller\npopulations or limited land area such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Maryland\ngenerally favored the Electoral College with some consideration for\nstates.[19] At the compromise providing for a runoff among the top five\ncandidates, the small states supposed that the House of Representatives with\neach state delegation casting one vote would decide most elections.[20]\n\nIn _[The Federalist Papers](/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers \"The Federalist\nPapers\")_ , [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\") explained his\nviews on the selection of the president and the\n[Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\").\nIn [Federalist No. 39](/wiki/Federalist_No._39 \"Federalist No. 39\"), Madison\nargued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of [state-\nbased](/wiki/Federalism_in_the_United_States \"Federalism in the United\nStates\") and [population-based](/wiki/Proportional_representation\n\"Proportional representation\") government.\n[Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") would have\ntwo houses: the state-based [Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States\nSenate\") and the population-based [House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\"). Meanwhile, the president would be elected by a\nmixture of the two modes.[21]\n\n[Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\") in\n[Federalist No. 68](/wiki/Federalist_No._68 \"Federalist No. 68\") laid out what\nhe believed were the key advantages to the Electoral College. The electors\ncome directly from the people and them alone for that purpose only, and for\nthat time only. This avoided a party-run legislature, or a permanent body that\ncould be influenced by foreign interests before each election.[22] Hamilton\nexplained the election was to take place among all the states, so no\ncorruption in any state could taint \"the great body of the people\" in their\nselection. The choice was to be made by a majority of the Electoral College,\nas majority rule is critical to the principles of republican government.\nHamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have\ninformation unavailable to the general public. Hamilton also argued that since\nno federal officeholder could be an elector, none of the electors would be\nbeholden to any presidential candidate.[22]\n\nAnother consideration was the decision would be made without \"tumult and\ndisorder\", as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various\nlocales where the decision-makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one\nplace where decision-makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the\nElectoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of\nRepresentatives was to choose the president from among the top five\ncandidates,[23] ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the\nlaws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned\nabout somebody unqualified, but with a talent for \"low intrigue, and the\nlittle arts of popularity\", attaining high office.[22]\n\nAdditionally, in the [Federalist No. 10](/wiki/Federalist_No._10 \"Federalist\nNo. 10\"), James Madison argued against \"an interested and overbearing\nmajority\" and the \"mischiefs of faction\" in an electoral system. He defined a\nfaction as \"a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority\nof the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion,\nor of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent\nand aggregate interests of the community.\" What was then called republican\ngovernment (i.e., [federalism](/wiki/Federalism \"Federalism\"), as opposed to\n[direct democracy](/wiki/Direct_democracy \"Direct democracy\")), with its\nvaried distribution of voter rights and powers, would countervail against\nfactions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No. 10 that the greater\nthe population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty factions would\nface in organizing due to such issues as [sectionalism](/wiki/Sectionalism\n\"Sectionalism\").[24]\n\nAlthough the United States Constitution refers to \"Electors\" and \"electors\",\nneither the phrase \"Electoral College\" nor any other name is used to describe\nthe electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century the name\n\"Electoral College\" came into general usage as the collective designation for\nthe electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The\nphrase was first written into federal law in 1845 and today the term appears\nin [3 U.S.C.](/wiki/Title_3_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 3 of the United\nStates Code\") [§ 4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/4), in the\nsection heading and in the text as \"college of electors.\"[25]\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Original\nplan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Original plan\")]\n\n[Article II, Section 1, Clause\n2](/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_2:_Method_of_choosing_electors\n\"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") of the Constitution states:\n\n> Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may\n> direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and\n> Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no\n> Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit\n> under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.\n\n[Article II, Section 1, Clause\n4](/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_4:_Election_day\n\"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") of the Constitution states:\n\n> The Congress may determine the Time of chusing [_[sic](/wiki/Sic \"Sic\")_]\n> the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day\n> shall be the same throughout the United States.\n\n[Article II, Section 1, Clause\n3](/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_3:_Electors\n\"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") of the Constitution provided\nthe original plan by which the electors chose the president and vice\npresident. Under the original plan, the candidate who received a majority of\nvotes from the electors would become president; the candidate receiving the\nsecond most votes would become vice president.\n\nThe original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions\nand anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution:[26]\n\n  1. Individual electors would be elected by citizens on a district-by-district basis.[27]\n  2. Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting.\n  3. Candidates would not pair together on the same [ticket](/wiki/Ticket_\\(election\\) \"Ticket \\(election\\)\") with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president.\n  4. The system as designed would rarely produce a winner, thus sending the election to Congress.\n\nAccording to the text of Article II, however, each state government was free\nto have its own plan for selecting its electors, and the Constitution does not\nexplicitly require states to popularly elect their electors. Several different\nmethods for selecting electors are described at length\n[below](/wiki/Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)#Alternative_methods_of_choosing_electors\n\"Electoral College \\(United States\\)\").\n\n### Breakdown and\nrevision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Breakdown and revision\")]\n\nThe emergence of [political parties](/wiki/Political_party \"Political party\")\nand nationally-coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the\nelections of [1796](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1796 \"United\nStates presidential election, 1796\") and\n[1800](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800 \"United States\npresidential election, 1800\"). In 1796, [Federalist\nParty](/wiki/Federalist_Party \"Federalist Party\") candidate [John\nAdams](/wiki/John_Adams \"John Adams\") won the presidential election. Finishing\nin second place was [Democratic-Republican Party](/wiki/Democratic-\nRepublican_Party \"Democratic-Republican Party\") candidate [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\"), the Federalists'\nopponent, who became the vice president. This resulted in the President and\nVice President not being of the same political party.\n\nIn 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for\npresident, and also nominated [Aaron Burr](/wiki/Aaron_Burr \"Aaron Burr\") for\nvice president. After the election, Jefferson and Burr both obtained a\nmajority of electoral votes, but tied one another with 73 votes each. Since\nballots did not distinguish between votes for president and votes for vice\npresident, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to\nbecome president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first choice.\nLacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had to be\ndecided by the [House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") pursuant to the Constitution's contingency election\nprovision.\n\nHaving already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party representatives\nin the [lame duck](/wiki/Lame_duck_\\(politics\\) \"Lame duck \\(politics\\)\")\nHouse session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition and\nattempted to elect Burr over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as\nneither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state\ndelegations in the House (the votes of nine states were needed for an\nelection). Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot, but only\nafter Federalist Party leader [Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton\n\"Alexander Hamilton\") – who disfavored Burr's personal character more than\nJefferson's policies – had made known his preference for Jefferson.\n\nResponding to the problems from those elections, the Congress proposed the\n[Twelfth Amendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") in 1803 – prescribing\nelectors cast separate ballots for president and vice president – to replace\nthe system outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3. By June 1804, the\nstates had ratified the amendment in time for the [1804\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1804 \"United States\npresidential election, 1804\").\n\n### Evolution to the general\nticket[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Evolution to the general ticket\")]\n\nAlexander Hamilton described the framers' view of how electors would be\nchosen, \"A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the\ngeneral mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment\nrequisite to such complicated [tasks].\"[28] The founders assumed this would\ntake place district by district. That plan was carried out by many states\nuntil the 1880s. For example, in [Massachusetts](/wiki/Massachusetts\n\"Massachusetts\") in 1820, the rule stated \"the people shall vote by ballot, on\nwhich shall be designated who is voted for as an Elector for the\ndistrict.\"[29] In other words, the people did not place the name of a\ncandidate for a president on the ballot, instead they voted for their local\nelector, whom they trusted later to cast a responsible vote for president.\n\nSome states reasoned that the favorite presidential candidate among the people\nin their state would have a much better chance if all of the electors selected\nby their state were sure to vote the same way – a \"general ticket\" of electors\npledged to a party candidate.[30] So the slate of electors chosen by the state\nwere no longer free agents, independent thinkers, or deliberative\nrepresentatives. They became \"voluntary party lackeys and intellectual non-\nentities.\"[31] Once one state took that strategy, the others felt compelled to\nfollow suit in order to compete for the strongest influence on the\nelection.[30]\n\nWhen [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\") and Hamilton, two of\nthe most important architects of the Electoral College, saw this strategy\nbeing taken by some states, they protested strongly. Madison and Hamilton both\nmade it clear this approach violated the spirit of the Constitution. According\nto Hamilton, the selection of the president should be \"made by men most\ncapable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president].\"[28]\nAccording to Hamilton, the electors were to analyze the list of potential\npresidents and select the best one. He also used the term \"deliberate.\"\nHamilton considered a pre-pledged elector to violate the spirit of Article II\nof the Constitution insofar as such electors could make no \"analysis\" or\n\"deliberate\" concerning the candidates. Madison agreed entirely, saying that\nwhen the Constitution was written, all of its authors assumed individual\nelectors would be elected in their districts and it was inconceivable a\n\"general ticket\" of electors dictated by a state would supplant the concept.\nMadison wrote to George Hay,\n\n> The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the\n> Constitution was framed and adopted; & was exchanged for the general ticket\n> [many years later].[32]\n\nThe founders assumed that electors would be elected by the citizens of their\ndistrict and that elector was to be free to analyze and deliberate regarding\nwho is best suited to be president.\n\nMadison and Hamilton were so upset by what they saw as a distortion of the\nframers’ original intent that they advocated for a constitutional amendment to\nprevent anything other than the district plan: \"the election of Presidential\nElectors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward\",\nMadison told George Hay in 1823.[32] Hamilton went further. He actually\ndrafted an amendment to the Constitution mandating the district plan for\nselecting electors.[33]\n\n### Evolution of selection\nplans[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Evolution of selection plans\")]\n\nIn 1789, at-large popular vote, the winner-take-all method, began with\nPennsylvania and Maryland; Virginia and Delaware used a district plan by\npopular vote, and in the five other states participating in the election\n(Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, New Hampshire New Jersey and South\nCarolina),[34] state legislatures chose. By 1800, Virginia and Rhode Island\nvoted at-large, Kentucky, Maryland and North Carolina voted popularly by\ndistrict, and eleven states voted by state legislature. Beginning in 1804\nthere was a definite trend towards the winner-take-all system for statewide\npopular vote.[35]\n\nStates using their state legislature to choose presidential electors have\nincluded fourteen states from all regions of the country. By 1832, only South\nCarolina used the state legislature, and it abandoned the method after\n1860.[35] States using popular vote by district have included ten states from\nall regions of the country. By 1832 there was only Maryland, and from 1836\ndistrict plans fell out of use until the 20th century, though Michigan used a\ndistrict plan for 1892 only.[36]\n\nSince 1836, statewide, winner-take-all popular voting for electors has been\nthe almost universal practice. As of\n2016[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit),\nMaine (from 1972) and Nebraska (from 1996) use the district plan, with two at-\nlarge electors assigned to support the winner of the statewide popular\nvote.[37]\n\n### Fourteenth\nAmendment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Fourteenth Amendment\")]\n\n[Section 2 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Apportionment_of_Representatives\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") allows for a state's\nrepresentation in the [House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") to be reduced if a state unconstitutionally denies\npeople the right to vote. The reduction is in keeping with the proportion of\npeople denied a vote. This amendment refers to voting \"at any election for the\nchoice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States;\" the\nonly place in the Constitution mentioning electors being selected by popular\nvote.\n\nOn May 8, 1866, during a debate on the Fourteenth Amendment, [Thaddeus\nStevens](/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens \"Thaddeus Stevens\"), the leader of the\n[Republicans](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party\n\\(United States\\)\") in the House of Representatives, delivered a speech on the\namendment's intent.

Since the [election of\n1824](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824 \"United States\npresidential election, 1824\"),[40] most states have appointed their electors\non a [winner-take-all](/wiki/Plurality_voting_system \"Plurality voting\nsystem\") basis, based on the statewide popular vote on [Election\nDay](/wiki/Election_Day_\\(United_States\\) \"Election Day \\(United States\\)\").\n[Maine](/wiki/Maine \"Maine\") and [Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska \"Nebraska\") are the\nonly two current exceptions, as both states use the congressional district\nmethod.

Each representative represents on average 711,000\npersons.[43]\n\nUnder the [Twenty-third Amendment](/wiki/Twenty-\nthird_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-third Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution\"), [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C.\n\"Washington, D.C.\"), is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were\na state, but no more electors than the least populous state. The least\npopulous state (which is [Wyoming](/wiki/Wyoming \"Wyoming\") according to the\n2010 Census) has three electors; thus, D.C. cannot have more than three\nelectors. Even if D.C. were a state, its population would entitle it to only\nthree electors; based on its population per electoral vote, D.C. has the\nsecond highest per-capita Electoral College representation, after Wyoming.[44]\n\nCurrently, there is a total of 538 electors, there being 435 representatives\nand 100 senators, plus the three electors allocated to Washington, D.C. The\nsix states with the most electors are [California](/wiki/California\n\"California\") (55), [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\") (38), [New\nYork](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New York \\(state\\)\") (29),\n[Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\") (29), [Illinois](/wiki/Illinois \"Illinois\")\n(20) and [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\") (20).

In some states, such as\n[Oklahoma](/wiki/Oklahoma \"Oklahoma\"), [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\")\nand [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\"), electors are\nnominated in party conventions. In [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania\n\"Pennsylvania\"), the campaign committee of each candidate names their\nrespective electoral college candidates (an attempt to discourage [faithless\nelectors](/wiki/Faithless_elector \"Faithless elector\")). Varying by state,\nelectors may also be elected by state legislatures, or appointed by the\nparties themselves.[45]\n\n####\nSelection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Selection\")]\n\n[Article II, Section 1, Clause\n2](/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article Two of the\nUnited States Constitution\") of the Constitution requires each state\nlegislature to determine how electors for the state are to be chosen, but it\ndisqualifies any person holding a federal office, either elected or appointed,\nfrom being an elector.[46] Under [Section 3 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Participants_in_rebellion\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), any person who has\nsworn an [oath](/wiki/Oath \"Oath\") to support the United States Constitution\nin order to hold either a state or federal office, and later rebelled against\nthe United States directly or by giving assistance to those doing so, is\ndisqualified from being an elector. However, the Congress may remove this\ndisqualification by a two-thirds vote in each House.\n\nSince the [Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\"), all\nstates have chosen presidential electors by popular vote. This process has\nbeen normalized to the point the names of the electors appear on the ballot in\nonly eight states: Rhode Island, Tennessee, Louisiana, Arizona, Idaho,\nOklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota.[10][47]\n\nThe Tuesday following the first Monday in November has been fixed as the day\nfor holding federal elections, called the Election Day.[48] In 48 states and\nWashington, D.C., the \"winner-takes-all method\" is used (electors selected as\na single bloc). Maine and Nebraska use the \"congressional district method\",\nselecting one elector within each congressional district by popular vote and\nselecting the remaining two electors by a statewide popular vote. This method\nhas been used in Maine since 1972 and in Nebraska since 1996.[9]\n\nThe current system of choosing electors is called the \"short ballot\". In most\nstates, voters choose a slate of electors, and only a few states list on the\nballot the names of proposed electors. In some states, if a voter wants to\nwrite in a candidate for president, the voter is also required to write in the\nnames of proposed electors.\n\nAfter the election, each state prepares seven Certificates of Ascertainment,\neach listing the candidates for president and vice president, their pledged\nelectors, and the total votes each candidacy received.[49] One certificate is\nsent, as soon after Election Day as practicable, to the National Archivist in\nWashington D.C. The Certificates of Ascertainment are mandated to carry the\nState Seal, and the signature of the Governor (in the case of the District of\nColumbia, the Certificate is signed by the [Mayor of the District of\nColumbia](/wiki/Mayor_of_the_District_of_Columbia \"Mayor of the District of\nColumbia\").[50])\n\n####\nMeetings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Meetings\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/A_certificate_for_the_electoral_vote_for_Rutherford_B._Hayes_and_William_A._Wheeler_for_the_State_of_Louisiana_dated_1876_part_6.jpg/220px-\nA_certificate_for_the_electoral_vote_for_Rutherford_B._Hayes_and_William_A._Wheeler_for_the_State_of_Louisiana_dated_1876_part_6.jpg)](/wiki/File:A_certificate_for_the_electoral_vote_for_Rutherford_B._Hayes_and_William_A._Wheeler_for_the_State_of_Louisiana_dated_1876_part_6.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:A_certificate_for_the_electoral_vote_for_Rutherford_B._Hayes_and_William_A._Wheeler_for_the_State_of_Louisiana_dated_1876_part_6.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nCertificate for the electoral votes for [Rutherford B.\nHayes](/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes \"Rutherford B.

Electors meet in their\nrespective [state\ncapitals](/wiki/List_of_capitals_in_the_United_States#State_capitals \"List of\ncapitals in the United States\") (electors for the District of Columbia meet\nwithin the District) on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, at\nwhich time they cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for president\nand vice president.[51][52][53]\n\nAlthough procedures in each state vary slightly, the electors generally follow\na similar series of steps, and the Congress has constitutional authority to\nregulate the procedures the states follow. The meeting is opened by the\nelection certification official – often that state's [secretary of\nstate](/wiki/Secretary_of_state_\\(U.S._state_government\\) \"Secretary of state\n\\(U.S. state government\\)\") or equivalent – who reads the Certificate of\nAscertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral\nvotes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in\nwriting. The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the\nmeeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a\nsecretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting.\nIn many states, political officials give short speeches at this point in the\nproceedings.\n\nWhen the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two people to\nact as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a\ncandidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the\npolitical party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with\nthe name of a candidate for president. In [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey \"New\nJersey\"), the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a\npre-printed card; in [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\"),\nthe electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers\ncount the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the\nvote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.\n\nEach state's electors must complete six Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate\nof Vote must be signed by all of the electors and a Certificate of\nAscertainment must be attached to each of the Certificates of Vote. Each\nCertificate of Vote must include the names of those who received an electoral\nvote for either the office of president or of vice president. The electors\ncertify the Certificates of Vote and copies of the Certificates are then sent\nin the following fashion:[54]\n\n  * One is sent by [registered mail](/wiki/Registered_mail \"Registered mail\") to the [President of the Senate](/wiki/President_of_the_Senate \"President of the Senate\") (who usually is the incumbent [Vice President of the United States](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States \"Vice President of the United States\"));\n  * Two are sent by registered mail to the [Archivist of the United States](/wiki/Archivist_of_the_United_States \"Archivist of the United States\");\n  * Two are sent to the state's Secretary of State; and\n  * One is sent to the chief judge of the [United States district court](/wiki/United_States_district_court \"United States district court\") where those electors met.\n\nA staff member of the President of the Senate collects the Certificates of\nVote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress.\nThe Certificates are arranged – unopened – in alphabetical order and placed in\ntwo special mahogany boxes. [Alabama](/wiki/Alabama \"Alabama\") through\n[Missouri](/wiki/Missouri \"Missouri\") (including the [District of\nColumbia](/wiki/District_of_Columbia \"District of Columbia\")) are placed in\none box and [Montana](/wiki/Montana \"Montana\") through [Wyoming](/wiki/Wyoming\n\"Wyoming\") are placed in the other box.[55] Before 1950, the [Secretary of\nState's](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United States Secretary of\nState\") office oversaw the certifications, but since then the Office of\nFederal Register in the Archivist's office reviews them to make sure the\ndocuments sent to the archive and Congress match and that all formalities have\nbeen followed, sometimes requiring states to correct the documents.[6]\n\n####\nFaithlessness[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Faithlessness\")]\n\nMain article: [Faithless elector](/wiki/Faithless_elector \"Faithless elector\")\n\nFaithless electors are those who either cast electoral votes for someone other\nthan the candidate of the party that they pledged to vote for or who\n[abstain](/wiki/Abstention \"Abstention\"). Twenty-nine states plus the District\nof Columbia have passed laws to punish faithless electors, although none have\never been enforced. Many constitutional scholars claim that state restrictions\nwould be struck down if challenged based on Article II and the Twelfth\nAmendment.[56] In 1952, the constitutionality of state pledge laws was brought\nbefore the [Supreme Court](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme\nCourt of the United States\") in _[Ray v. Blair](/wiki/Ray_v._Blair \"Ray v.\nBlair\")_ , [343](/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_343\n\"List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 343\")\n[U.S.](/wiki/United_States_Reports \"United States Reports\")\n[214](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/214/) (1952). The Court\nruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the\nwinning candidate, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge. As\nstated in the ruling, electors are acting as a functionary of the state, not\nthe federal government. Therefore, states have the right to govern the process\nof choosing electors. The constitutionality of state laws punishing electors\nfor actually casting a faithless vote, rather than refusing to pledge, has\nnever been decided by the Supreme Court. However, in his dissent in _Ray v.\nBlair_ , Justice Robert Jackson wrote: \"no one faithful to our history can\ndeny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text – that\nelectors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan\njudgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.\"\n\nWhile many laws punish a faithless elector only after the fact, states like\n[Michigan](/wiki/Michigan \"Michigan\") also specify a faithless elector's vote\nbe voided.[57]\n\nAs electoral slates are typically chosen by the political party or the party's\npresidential nominee, electors usually have high loyalty to the party and its\ncandidate: a faithless elector runs a greater risk of party censure than of\ncriminal charges.\n\nIn [2000](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000 \"United States\npresidential election, 2000\"), elector [Barbara Lett-\nSimmons](/wiki/Barbara_Lett-Simmons \"Barbara Lett-Simmons\") of [Washington,\nD.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\"), chose not to vote, rather\nthan voting for Al Gore as she had pledged to do.[58] In\n[2016](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016 \"United States\npresidential election, 2016\"), seven electors voted contrary to their pledges.\nFaithless electors have never changed the outcome of any presidential\nelection.[59]\n\n### Joint session of Congress and\ncontingencies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Joint session of Congress and contingencies\")]\n\nFurther information: [Contingent election](/wiki/Contingent_election\n\"Contingent election\")\n\nThe [Twelfth\nAmendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twelfth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") mandates Congress assemble in\njoint session to count the electoral votes and declare the winners of the\nelection.[60] The session is ordinarily required to take place on January 6 in\nthe calendar year immediately following the meetings of the presidential\nelectors.[61] Since the [Twentieth\nAmendment](/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), the newly elected\nCongress declares the winner of the election; all elections before\n[1936](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1936 \"United States\npresidential election, 1936\") were determined by the outgoing House.\n\nThe meeting is held at 1:00 pm in the Chamber of the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives.[61] The sitting vice president is expected to preside, but in\nseveral cases the [President _pro tempore_ of the\nSenate](/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate \"President pro\ntempore of the United States Senate\") has chaired the proceedings. The vice\npresident and the [Speaker of the\nHouse](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Speaker of\nthe United States House of Representatives\") sit at the podium, with the vice\npresident in the seat of the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the\ntwo mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on\ntables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two\ntellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party).\nRelevant portions of the Certificate of Vote are read for each state, in\nalphabetical order.\n\nMembers of Congress can object to any state's vote count, provided objection\nis presented in writing and is signed by at least one member of each house of\nCongress. An objection supported by at least one senator and one\nrepresentative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by\nseparate debates and votes in each House of Congress; after both Houses\ndeliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed. A state's\ncertificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to\naccept the objection. In that case, the votes from the State in question are\nsimply ignored. The votes of Arkansas and Louisiana were rejected in the\n[presidential election of\n1872](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1872 \"United States\npresidential election, 1872\").[62]\n\nObjections to the electoral vote count are rarely raised, although it did\noccur during the vote count in 2001 after the close 2000 presidential election\nbetween Governor George W. Bush of Texas and the Vice President of the United\nStates, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his\nown Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections,\nall of which were raised by only several representatives and would have\nfavored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object.\nObjections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections, and on\nthat occasion the document was presented by one representative and one\nsenator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly\ndisposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. If there are no\nobjections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply\nincludes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the\nofficial tally.\n\nAfter the certificates from all states are read and the respective votes are\ncounted, the presiding officer simply announces the final result of the vote\nand, provided the required absolute majority of votes was achieved, declares\nthe names of the persons elected president and vice president. This\nannouncement concludes the joint session and formalizes the recognition of the\npresident-elect and of the vice president-elect. The senators then depart from\nthe House Chamber. The final tally is printed in the Senate and House\njournals.\n\n#### Contingent presidential election by\nHouse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Contingent presidential election by House\")]\n\nThe [Twelfth\nAmendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twelfth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") requires the [House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") to go into session immediately to vote for a\npresident if no candidate for president receives a majority of the electoral\nvotes (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes).\n\nIn this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among\nthe three candidates who received the most electoral votes for president. Each\nstate delegation votes _en bloc_ – each delegation having a single vote; the\nDistrict of Columbia does not receive a vote. A candidate must receive an\nabsolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., at present, a minimum of 26\nvotes) in order for that candidate to become the _President-elect_.\nAdditionally, delegations from at least two-thirds of all the states must be\npresent for voting to take place. The House continues balloting until it\nelects a president.\n\nThe House of Representatives has chosen the president only twice: in\n[1801](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800 \"United States\npresidential election, 1800\") under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3; and in\n[1825](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824 \"United States\npresidential election, 1824\") under the Twelfth Amendment.\n\n#### Contingent vice presidential election by\nSenate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Contingent vice presidential election by Senate\")]\n\nIf no candidate for vice president receives an absolute majority of electoral\nvotes, then the [Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\")\nmust go into session to elect a vice president. The Senate is limited to\nchoosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for\nvice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less than the\nnumber of candidates available in the House vote. However, the text is written\nin such a way that _all_ candidates with the most and second most electoral\nvotes are eligible for the Senate election – this number could theoretically\nbe larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e.,\nballots are individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations).\nHowever, two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.\n\nAdditionally, the Twelfth Amendment states a \"majority of the whole number\" of\nsenators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election.[63] Further, the\nlanguage requiring an absolute majority of Senate votes precludes the sitting\nvice president from breaking any tie which might occur,[64] although some\nacademics and journalists have speculated to the contrary.[65]\n\nThe only time the Senate chose the vice president was in\n[1837](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1836 \"United States\npresidential election, 1836\"). In that instance, the Senate adopted an\nalphabetical [roll call](/wiki/Voting_methods_in_deliberative_assemblies\n\"Voting methods in deliberative assemblies\") and voting aloud. The rules\nfurther stated, \"[I]f a majority of the number of senators shall vote for\neither the said [Richard M.

Section 3 also\nspecifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if\nthere is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the\ninauguration. Under the [Presidential Succession Act of\n1947](/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act#Presidential_Succession_Act_of_1947\n\"Presidential Succession Act\"), the [Speaker of the\nHouse](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Speaker of\nthe United States House of Representatives\") would become acting president\nuntil either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice\npresident. Neither of these situations has ever occurred.\n\n### Current electoral vote\ndistribution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Current electoral vote distribution\")]\n\nSee also: [Electoral vote changes between United States presidential\nelections](/wiki/Electoral_vote_changes_between_United_States_presidential_elections\n\"Electoral vote changes between United States presidential elections\")\n\nElectoral votes (EV) allocations for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 presidential\nelections.[67]  \nTriangular markers (![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)) indicate gains or losses following the 2010 Census.[68] EV × States | States*  \n---|---  \n**3** × 8 = 24 | Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia*, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming  \n**4** × 5 = 20 | Hawaii, Idaho, Maine**, New Hampshire, Rhode Island  \n**5** × 3 = 15 | Nebraska**, New Mexico, West Virginia  \n**6** × 6 = 36 | Arkansas, ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, ![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)Nevada, ![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)Utah  \n**7** × 3 = 21 | Connecticut, Oklahoma, Oregon  \n**8** × 2 = 16 | Kentucky, ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)Louisiana  \n**9** × 3 = 27 | Alabama, Colorado, ![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)South Carolina  \n**10** × 4 = 40 | Maryland, Minnesota, ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)Missouri, Wisconsin  \n**11** × 4 = 44 | ![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)Arizona, Indiana, ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)Massachusetts, Tennessee  \n**12** × 1 = 12 | ![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)Washington  \n**13** × 1 = 13 | Virginia  \n**14** × 1 = 14 | ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)New Jersey  \n**15** × 1 = 15 | North Carolina  \n**16** × 2 = 32 | ![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)Georgia, ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)Michigan  \n**18** × 1 = 18 | ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)Ohio  \n**20** × 2 = 40 | ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)Illinois, ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)Pennsylvania  \n**29** × 2 = 58 | ![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)Florida, ![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)![Decrease](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Decrease2.svg/11px-Decrease2.svg.png)New York  \n**38** × 1 = 38 | ![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)![Increase](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png)Texas  \n**55** × 1 = 55 | California  \n= 538 | Total electors  \n  \n    * _The[Twenty-third Amendment](/wiki/Twenty-third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution\") grants electors to DC as if it were a state, but not more than the least populous state.

of electing the presidential electors was through\nthe _general ticket_. The general ticket is quite similar to the current\nsystem and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast\nballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short\nballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general\nticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each\ncandidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with\nmultiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are\noften considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was\nadopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by\n[North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\") and [Ohio](/wiki/Ohio\n\"Ohio\") in 1932. [Alabama](/wiki/Alabama \"Alabama\") was still using the\ngeneral ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the\nshort ballot.\n\nThe question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the\nlegislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in\ntwo U.S. Supreme Court cases. In _McPherson v. Blacker_ ,\n[146](/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_146 \"List of\nUnited States Supreme Court cases, volume 146\")\n[U.S.](/wiki/United_States_Reports \"United States Reports\")\n[1](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/146/1/) (1892), the Court\ncited Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 which states that a state's electors are\nselected \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct\" and wrote\nthese words \"operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any\nattempt to circumscribe the legislative power\". In _Bush v. Palm Beach County\nCanvassing Board_ ,\n[531](/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_531 \"List of\nUnited States Supreme Court cases, volume 531\")\n[U.S.](/wiki/United_States_Reports \"United States Reports\")\n[70](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/70/) (2000), a Florida\nSupreme Court decision was vacated (not reversed) based on _McPherson_. On the\nother hand, three dissenting justices in _[Bush v. Gore](/wiki/Bush_v._Gore\n\"Bush v. Gore\")_ ,\n[531](/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_531 \"List of\nUnited States Supreme Court cases, volume 531\")\n[U.S.](/wiki/United_States_Reports \"United States Reports\")\n[98](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/) (2000), wrote:\n\"[N]othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state\nlegislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created\nit.\"[70]\n\n### Appointment by state\nlegislature[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Appointment by state legislature\")]\n\nIn the earliest presidential elections, state legislative choice was the most\ncommon method of choosing electors. A majority of the state legislatures\nselected presidential electors in both 1792 (9 of 15) and 1800 (10 of 16), and\nhalf of them did so in 1812.[71] Even in [the 1824\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824 \"United States\npresidential election, 1824\"), a quarter of state legislatures (6 of 24) chose\nelectors. In that election, [Andrew Jackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew\nJackson\") lost in spite of having pluralities of both the popular and\nelectoral votes,[72] with the outcome being decided by the six state\nlegislatures choosing the electors. Some state legislatures simply chose\nelectors, while other states used a hybrid method in which state legislatures\nchose from a group of electors elected by popular vote.[73] By 1828, with the\nrise of [Jacksonian democracy](/wiki/Jacksonian_democracy \"Jacksonian\ndemocracy\"), only [Delaware](/wiki/Delaware \"Delaware\") and [South\nCarolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\") used legislative choice.[72]\nDelaware ended its practice the following election (1832), while South\nCarolina continued using the method until it seceded from the Union in\nDecember 1860.[72] South Carolina used the popular vote for the first time in\nthe [1868 election](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1868 \"United\nStates presidential election, 1868\").[74]\n\nExcluding South Carolina, legislative appointment was used in only four\nsituations after 1832:\n\n  * In 1848, [Massachusetts](/wiki/Massachusetts \"Massachusetts\") statute awarded the state's electoral votes to the winner of the at-large popular vote, but only if that candidate won an absolute majority. When the vote produced no winner between the [Democratic](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party \\(United States\\)\"), [Free Soil](/wiki/Free_Soil_Party \"Free Soil Party\"), and [Whig](/wiki/Whig_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Whig Party \\(United States\\)\") parties, the state legislature selected the electors, giving all 12 electoral votes to the Whigs.[75]\n  * In 1864, [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada \"Nevada\"), having joined the Union only a few days prior to Election Day, had no choice but to legislatively appoint.[75]\n  * In 1868, the newly reconstructed state of [Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\") legislatively appointed its electors, having been readmitted too late to hold elections.[75]\n  * Finally, in 1876, the legislature of the newly admitted state of [Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\") used legislative choice due to a lack of time and money to hold a popular election.[75]\n\nLegislative appointment was brandished as a possibility in the [2000\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000 \"United States\npresidential election, 2000\"). Had the recount continued, the Florida\nlegislature was prepared to appoint the Republican slate of electors to avoid\nmissing the federal safe-harbor deadline for choosing electors.[76]\n\nThe Constitution gives each state legislature the power to decide how its\nstate's electors are chosen[72] and it can be easier and cheaper for a state\nlegislature to simply appoint a slate of electors than to create a legislative\nframework for holding elections to determine the electors. As noted above, the\ntwo situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War\nhave both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an\nelection. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative\nconsequences: [bicameral](/wiki/Bicameral \"Bicameral\") legislatures can\ndeadlock more easily than the electorate. This is precisely what happened to\nNew York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.[77]\n\n### Electoral\ndistricts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Electoral districts\")]\n\nAnother method used early in U.S. history was to divide the state into\nelectoral districts. By this method, voters in each district would cast their\nballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would\nbecome the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by\ncongressional districts. However, the difference stems from the fact every\nstate always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As\nwith congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to\n[gerrymandering](/wiki/Gerrymandering \"Gerrymandering\").\n\n### Proportional\nvote[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Proportional vote\")]\n\nUnder such a system, electors would be selected in proportion to the votes\ncast for their candidate or party, rather than being selected by the statewide\nplurality vote.[78]\n\n### Congressional district\nmethod[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Congressional district method\")]\n\nThere are two versions of the congressional district method: one has been\nimplemented in Maine and Nebraska; another has been proposed in Virginia.\nUnder the implemented congressional district method, the electoral votes are\ndistributed based on the popular vote winner within each of the states'\n[congressional districts](/wiki/Congressional_district \"Congressional\ndistrict\"); the statewide popular vote winner receives two additional\nelectoral votes.[79]\n\nIn 2013, a different version of the congressional district method was proposed\nin Virginia. This version would distribute Virginia's electoral votes based on\nthe popular vote winner within each of Virginia's congressional districts; the\ntwo statewide electoral votes would be awarded based on which candidate won\nthe most congressional districts, rather than on who won Virginia's statewide\npopular vote.[80]\n\nThe congressional district method can more easily be implemented than other\nalternatives to the winner-takes-all method, in view of major party resistance\nto relatively enabling third parties under the proportional method. State\nlegislation is sufficient to use this method.[81] Advocates of the\ncongressional district method believe the system would encourage higher [voter\nturnout](/wiki/Voter_turnout \"Voter turnout\") and incentivize presidential\ncandidates to broaden their campaigns in non-competitive states.[82] Winner-\ntake-all systems ignore thousands of popular votes; in Democratic California\nthere are Republican districts, in Republican Texas there are Democratic\ndistricts. Because candidates have an incentive to campaign in competitive\ndistricts, with a district plan, candidates have an incentive to actively\ncampaign in over thirty states versus seven \"swing\" states.[83][84] Opponents\nof the system, however, argue candidates might only spend time in certain\nbattleground districts instead of the entire state and cases of\n[gerrymandering](/wiki/Gerrymandering \"Gerrymandering\") could become\nexacerbated as political parties attempt to draw as many safe districts as\nthey can.[85]\n\nUnlike simple congressional district comparisons, the district plan popular\nvote bonus in the 2008 election would have given Obama 56% of the Electoral\nCollege versus the 68% he did win, it \"would have more closely approximated\nthe percentage of the popular vote won [53%]\".[86]\n\n####\nImplementation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Implementation\")]\n\nOf the 43 states whose electoral votes could be affected by the congressional\ndistrict method, only [Maine](/wiki/Maine \"Maine\") and\n[Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska \"Nebraska\") apply it today. Maine has four electoral\nvotes, based on its two representatives and two senators. Nebraska has two\nsenators and three representatives, giving it five electoral votes.[87] Maine\nbegan using the congressional district method in the [election of\n1972](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1972 \"United States\npresidential election, 1972\"). Nebraska has used the congressional district\nmethod since the [election of\n1992](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1992 \"United States\npresidential election, 1992\").[88] Schwartz, Maralee (April 7, 1991).\n[\"Nebraska's Vote\nChange\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/04/07/nebraskas-\nvote-change/4ef16f69-1158-4e39-9556-4e65a666d735/). _The Washington Post_.\nMichigan used the system for the [1892 presidential\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1892 \"United States\npresidential election, 1892\"),[79][89][90] and several other states used\nvarious forms of the district plan before 1840: Virginia, Delaware, Maryland,\nKentucky, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, and New\nYork.[91]\n\nThe congressional district method allows a state the chance to split its\nelectoral votes between multiple candidates. Prior to 2008, neither Maine nor\nNebraska had ever split their electoral votes.[79] Nebraska split its\nelectoral votes for the first time in 2008, giving John McCain its statewide\nelectors and those of two congressional districts, while Barack Obama won the\nelectoral vote of [Nebraska's 2nd congressional\ndistrict](/wiki/Nebraska%27s_2nd_congressional_district \"Nebraska's 2nd\ncongressional district\").[92] Following the 2008 split, some Nebraska\nRepublicans made efforts to discard the congressional district method and\nreturn to the winner-takes-all system.[93] In January 2010, a bill was\nintroduced in the Nebraska legislature to revert to a winner-take-all\nsystem;[94] the bill died in committee in March 2011.[95] Republicans had also\npassed bills in 1995 and 1997 to eliminate the congressional district method\nin Nebraska, but those bills were [vetoed](/wiki/Veto \"Veto\") by Democratic\nGovernor [Ben Nelson](/wiki/Ben_Nelson \"Ben Nelson\").[93]\n\nIn 2010, Republicans in Pennsylvania, who controlled both houses of the\nlegislature as well as the governorship, put forward a plan to change the\nstate's winner-takes-all system to a congressional district method system.\nPennsylvania had voted for the Democratic candidate in the five previous\npresidential elections, so some saw this as an attempt to take away Democratic\nelectoral votes. Although Democrat [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack\nObama\") won Pennsylvania in\n[2008](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008 \"United States\npresidential election, 2008\"), he won only 55% of Pennsylvania's popular vote.\nThe district plan would have awarded him 11 of its 21 electoral votes, a 52.4%\nthat is closer to the popular vote yet still overcoming Republican\ngerrymandering.[96][97] The plan later lost support.[98] Other Republicans,\nincluding Michigan state representative [Pete Lund](/wiki/Pete_Lund \"Pete\nLund\"),[99] [RNC](/wiki/Republican_National_Committee \"Republican National\nCommittee\") Chairman [Reince Priebus](/wiki/Reince_Priebus \"Reince Priebus\"),\nand Wisconsin Governor [Scott Walker](/wiki/Scott_Walker_\\(politician\\) \"Scott\nWalker \\(politician\\)\"), have floated similar ideas.[100][101]\n\n## Contemporary\nissues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Contemporary issues\")]\n\nArguments between proponents and opponents of the current electoral system\ninclude four separate but related topics: indirect election, disproportionate\nvoting power by some states, the winner-takes-all distribution method (as\nchosen by 48 of the 50 states), and federalism.

One view is\nthe Electoral College violates the principle of political equality, since\npresidential elections are not decided by the one-person one-vote\nprinciple.[105] Outcomes of this sort are attributable to the federal nature\nof the system.

In this case,\nthe very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states\nwould aggregate to a plurality of the ballots cast nationally. However,\ncommentators question the legitimacy of this national popular vote; pointing\nout that the national popular vote observed under the Electoral College system\ndoes not reflect the popular vote observed under a National Popular Vote\nsystem; as each electoral institution produces different incentives for, and\nstrategy choices by, presidential campaigns.[108][109] Because the national\npopular vote is irrelevant under the electoral college system, it is generally\npresumed candidates base their campaign strategies around the existence of the\nElectoral College; any close race has candidates campaigning to maximize\nelectoral votes by focusing their get-out-the-vote efforts in crucially needed\nswing states and not attempting to maximize national popular vote totals by\nusing limited campaign resources to run up margins or close up gaps in states\nconsidered \"safe\" for themselves or their opponents, respectively. Conversely,\nthe institutional structure of a national popular vote system would encourage\ncandidates to pursue voter turnout wherever votes could be found, even in\n\"safe\" states they are already expected to win, and in \"safe\" states they have\nno hope of winning.\n\nEducational YouTuber [CGP Grey](/wiki/CGP_Grey \"CGP Grey\"), who has produced\nseveral short videos criticizing the Electoral College, has illustrated how it\nis technically possible to win the necessary 270 electoral votes while winning\nonly 22% of the overall popular vote, by winning the barest simple majority of\nthe 40 smallest states and the District of Columbia. Though the current\npolitical geography of the United States makes such an election unlikely (it\nwould require winning both reliably Democratic jurisdictions like\nMassachusetts and D.C. and reliably Republican states like Utah and Alaska),\nhe argues that a system in which such a result is even remotely possible is\n\"indefensible\".[110]\n\n> The United States is the only country that elects a politically powerful\n> president via an electoral college and the only one in which a candidate can\n> become president without having obtained the highest number of votes in the\n> sole or final round of popular voting.\n>\n> — [George C.

At the top, each waving hand represents a visit\nfrom a presidential or vice presidential candidate during the final five\nweeks. At the bottom, each dollar sign represents one million dollars spent on\nTV advertising by the campaigns during the same time period.[111]\n\nAccording to this criticism, the Electoral College encourages political\ncampaigners to focus on a few so-called \"swing states\" while ignoring the rest\nof the country. Populous states in which pre-election poll results show no\nclear favorite are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television\nadvertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers and debates, while\n\"four out of five\" voters in the national election are \"absolutely ignored\",\naccording to one assessment.[112] Since most states use a [winner-takes-\nall](/wiki/Plurality_voting_system \"Plurality voting system\") arrangement in\nwhich the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the\nstate's electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost\nexclusively on only a few key undecided states; in recent elections, these\nstates have included [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"),\n[Ohio](/wiki/Ohio \"Ohio\"), and [Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\") in 2004 and\n2008, and also [Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\") in 2012. In contrast,\nstates with large populations such as [California](/wiki/California\n\"California\"), [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\"), and [New\nYork](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New York \\(state\\)\"), have in recent elections\nbeen considered \"safe\" for a particular party –\n[Democratic](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party\n\\(United States\\)\") for California and New York and\n[Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party\n\\(United States\\)\") for Texas – and therefore campaigns spend less time and\nmoney there. Many small states are also considered to be \"safe\" for one of the\ntwo political parties and are also generally ignored by campaigners: of the 13\nsmallest states, six are reliably Democratic, six are reliably Republican, and\nonly New Hampshire is considered as a swing state, according to critic George\nC. Edwards III.[105] In the 2008 election, campaigns did not mount nationwide\nefforts but rather focused on select states.[105]\n\n#### Discouragement of turnout and\nparticipation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Discouragement of turnout and participation\")]\n\nExcept in closely fought swing states, voter turnout is largely insignificant\ndue to entrenched political party domination in most states. The Electoral\nCollege decreases the advantage a political party or campaign might gain for\nencouraging voters to turn out, except in those swing states.[113] If the\npresidential election were decided by a national popular vote, in contrast,\ncampaigns and parties would have a strong incentive to work to increase\nturnout everywhere.[114] Individuals would similarly have a stronger incentive\nto persuade their friends and neighbors to turn out to vote. The differences\nin turnout between swing states and non-swing states under the current\nelectoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with\ndirect election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and\nparticipation significantly.[113]\n\n#### Obscuring disenfranchisement within\nstates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Obscuring disenfranchisement within states\")]\n\nAccording to this criticism, the electoral college reduces elections to a mere\ncount of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any\nvoting problems _within_ a particular state. For example, if a particular\nstate blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by [voter\nsuppression](/wiki/Voter_suppression \"Voter suppression\") methods such as\nimposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally\n[disfranchising](/wiki/Disfranchisement \"Disfranchisement\") specific minority\ngroups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's\nelectoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement has no effect on the\noverall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is\npartially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the\nElectoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no\nincentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in\nelections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event.\nAccording to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would\nbe motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then\nhave more political clout nationally. Critics contend the electoral college\nsystem insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal\npenalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.\n\nLegal scholars [Akhil Amar](/wiki/Akhil_Reed_Amar \"Akhil Reed Amar\") and\n[Vikram Amar](/wiki/Vikram_Amar \"Vikram Amar\") have argued the original\nElectoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled the\nsouthern states to disenfranchise its slave populations.[115] It permitted\nsouthern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while allowing these\nstates to maintain political clout within the federation by using the [three-\nfifths compromise](/wiki/Three-fifths_compromise \"Three-fifths compromise\").\nThey noted that constitutional Framer [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison\n\"James Madison\") believed the question of counting slaves had presented a\nserious challenge but that \"the substitution of electors obviated this\ndifficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to the fewest\nobjections.\"[116] Akhil and Vikram Amar added that:\n\n> The founders' system also encouraged the continued disfranchisement of\n> women. In a direct national election system, any state that gave women the\n> vote would automatically have doubled its national clout. Under the\n> Electoral College, however, a state had no such incentive to increase the\n> franchise; as with slaves, what mattered was how many women lived in a\n> state, not how many were empowered ... a state with low voter turnout gets\n> precisely the same number of electoral votes as if it had a high turnout.

Proponents of the current system argue the collective\nopinion of even a small state merits attention at the federal level greater\nthan that given to a small, though numerically equivalent, portion of a very\npopulous state. The system also allows each state the freedom, within\nconstitutional bounds, to design its own laws on voting and enfranchisement\nwithout an undue incentive to maximize the number of votes cast.\n\nFor many years early in the nation's history, up until the [Jacksonian\nEra](/wiki/Jacksonian_Era \"Jacksonian Era\"), many states appointed their\nelectors by a vote of the [state\nlegislature](/wiki/State_legislature_\\(United_States\\) \"State legislature\n\\(United States\\)\"), and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of\nthe President must still come down to the decisions of each state, or the\nfederal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive,\ncentralized government.[133]\n\nIn his book _[A More Perfect Constitution](/wiki/A_More_Perfect_Constitution\n\"A More Perfect Constitution\")_ , Professor [Larry Sabato](/wiki/Larry_Sabato\n\"Larry Sabato\") elaborated on this advantage of the Electoral College, arguing\nto \"mend it, don't end it\", in part because of its usefulness in forcing\ncandidates to pay attention to lightly populated states and reinforcing the\nrole of the state in federalism.[134]\n\n#### Enhancement of the status of minority\ngroups[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=40\n\"Edit section: Enhancement of the status of minority groups\")]\n\nInstead of decreasing the power of [minority groups](/wiki/Minority_group\n\"Minority group\") by depressing voter turnout, proponents argue that by making\nthe votes of a given state an all-or-nothing affair, minority groups can\nprovide the critical edge that allows a candidate to win. This encourages\ncandidates to court a wide variety of such minorities and [advocacy\ngroups](/wiki/Advocacy_group \"Advocacy group\").[133]\n\n#### Encouragement of stability through the two-party\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=41\n\"Edit section: Encouragement of stability through the two-party system\")]\n\nProponents of the Electoral College see its negative effect on [third\nparties](/wiki/Third_party_\\(politics\\) \"Third party \\(politics\\)\") as\nbeneficial. They argue the two party system has provided stability because it\nencourages a delayed adjustment during times of rapid political and cultural\nchange. They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from\ncontrol by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can\nmoderate their views to win broad, long-term support across the nation.\nAdvocates of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect\nwould also be true in popular vote elections. Of 918 elections for governor\nbetween 1948 and 2009, for example, more than 90% were won by candidates\nsecuring more than 50% of the vote, and none have been won with less than 35%\nof the vote.[135]\n\n#### Flexibility if a presidential candidate\ndies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=42\n\"Edit section: Flexibility if a presidential candidate dies\")]\n\nAccording to this argument, the fact the Electoral College is made up of real\npeople instead of mere numbers allows for human judgment and flexibility to\nmake a decision, if it happens that a candidate dies or becomes legally\ndisabled around the time of the election. Advocates of the current system\nargue that human electors would be in a better position to choose a suitable\nreplacement than the general voting public. According to this view, electors\ncould act decisively during the critical time interval between when ballot\nchoices become fixed in state ballots[136] until mid-December when the\nelectors formally cast their ballots.[137] In the [election of\n1872](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1872 \"United States\npresidential election, 1872\"), losing [Liberal\nRepublican](/wiki/Liberal_Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Liberal\nRepublican Party \\(United States\\)\") candidate [Horace\nGreeley](/wiki/Horace_Greeley \"Horace Greeley\") died during this time interval\nwhich resulted in disarray for the [Democratic\nParty](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party \\(United\nStates\\)\"), who also supported Greeley, but the Greeley electors were able to\nsplit their votes for different alternate candidates.[138][139][140] A\nsituation in which the winning candidate died has never happened. In the\n[election of 1912](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1912 \"United\nStates presidential election, 1912\"), [Vice\nPresident](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States \"Vice President of the\nUnited States\") [Sherman](/wiki/James_S._Sherman \"James S. Sherman\") died\nshortly before the election when it was too late for states to remove his name\nfrom their ballots; accordingly, Sherman was listed posthumously, but the\neight electoral votes that Sherman would have received were cast instead for\n[Nicholas Murray Butler](/wiki/Nicholas_Murray_Butler \"Nicholas Murray\nButler\").[141]\n\n#### Isolation of election\nproblems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: Isolation of election problems\")]\n\nSome supporters of the Electoral College note that it isolates the impact of\nany election fraud, or other such problems, to the state where it occurs. It\nprevents instances where a party dominant in one state may dishonestly inflate\nthe votes for a candidate and thereby affect the election outcome. For\ninstance, recounts occur only on a state-by-state basis, not nationwide.[142]\nResults in a single state where the popular vote is very close – such as\nFlorida in 2000 – can decide the national election.[143]\n\n## Efforts to\nabolish[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=44\n\"Edit section: Efforts to abolish\")]\n\n### Constitutional\namendment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=45\n\"Edit section: Constitutional amendment\")]\n\n#### Bayh–Celler\namendment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=46\n\"Edit section: Bayh–Celler amendment\")]\n\nThe closest the United States has come to abolishing the Electoral College\noccurred during the [91st Congress](/wiki/91st_United_States_Congress \"91st\nUnited States Congress\") (1969–1971).[144] The [presidential election of\n1968](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1968 \"United States\npresidential election, 1968\") resulted in [Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon\n\"Richard Nixon\") receiving 301 electoral votes (56% of electors), [Hubert\nHumphrey](/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey \"Hubert Humphrey\") 191 (35.5%) and [George\nWallace](/wiki/George_Wallace \"George Wallace\") 46 (8.5%) with 13.5% of the\npopular vote. However, Nixon had only received 511,944 more popular votes than\nHumphrey, 43.5% to 42.9%, less than 1% of the national total.[145]\n\nRepresentative [Emanuel Celler](/wiki/Emanuel_Celler \"Emanuel Celler\") (D –\nNew York), Chairman of the [House Judiciary\nCommittee](/wiki/House_Judiciary_Committee \"House Judiciary Committee\"),\nresponded to public concerns over the disparity between the popular vote and\nelectoral vote by introducing House Joint Resolution 681, a proposed\nConstitutional amendment which would have replaced the Electoral College with\nsimpler plurality system based on the national popular vote. With this system,\nthe pair of candidates who had received the highest number of votes would win\nthe presidency and vice presidency providing they won at least 40% of the\nnational popular vote. If no pair received 40% of the popular vote, a runoff\nelection would be held in which the choice of President and vice president\nwould be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest\nnumber of votes in the first election. The word \"pair\" was defined as \"two\npersons who shall have consented to the joining of their names as candidates\nfor the offices of President and Vice President\".[146]\n\nOn April 29, 1969, the House Judiciary Committee voted 28 to 6 to approve the\nproposal.[147] Debate on the proposal before the full House of Representatives\nended on September 11, 1969[148] and was eventually passed with bipartisan\nsupport on September 18, 1969, by a vote of 339 to 70.[149]\n\nOn September 30, 1969, President Richard Nixon gave his endorsement for\nadoption of the proposal, encouraging the Senate to pass its version of the\nproposal which had been sponsored as Senate Joint Resolution 1 by Senator\n[Birch Bayh](/wiki/Birch_Bayh \"Birch Bayh\") (D – Indiana).[150]\n\nOn October 8, 1969, the _New York Times_ reported that 30 state legislatures\nwere \"either certain or likely to approve a constitutional amendment embodying\nthe direct election plan if it passes its final Congressional test in the\nSenate\". Ratification of 38 state legislatures would have been needed for\nadoption. The paper also reported that 6 other states had yet to state a\npreference, 6 were leaning toward opposition and 8 were solidly opposed.[151]\n\nOn August 14, 1970, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent its report advocating\npassage of the proposal to the full Senate. The Judiciary Committee had\napproved the proposal by a vote of 11 to 6. The six members who opposed the\nplan, Democratic Senators [James Eastland](/wiki/James_Eastland \"James\nEastland\") of Mississippi, [John Little McClellan](/wiki/John_Little_McClellan\n\"John Little McClellan\") of Arkansas and [Sam Ervin](/wiki/Sam_Ervin \"Sam\nErvin\") of North Carolina along with Republican Senators [Roman\nHruska](/wiki/Roman_Hruska \"Roman Hruska\") of Nebraska, [Hiram\nFong](/wiki/Hiram_Fong \"Hiram Fong\") of Hawaii and [Strom\nThurmond](/wiki/Strom_Thurmond \"Strom Thurmond\") of South Carolina, all argued\nthat although the present system had potential loopholes, it had worked well\nthroughout the years. Senator Bayh indicated that supporters of the measure\nwere about a dozen votes shy from the 67 needed for the proposal to pass the\nfull Senate. He called upon President Nixon to attempt to persuade undecided\nRepublican senators to support the proposal.[152] However, Nixon, while not\nreneging on his previous endorsement, chose not to make any further personal\nappeals to back the proposal.[153]\n\nOn September 8, 1970, the Senate commenced openly debating the proposal[154]\nand the proposal was quickly [filibustered](/wiki/Filibuster#United_States\n\"Filibuster\"). The lead objectors to the proposal were mostly Southern\nsenators and conservatives from small states, both Democrats and Republicans,\nwho argued abolishing the Electoral College would reduce their states'\npolitical influence.[153] On September 17, 1970, a motion for\n[cloture](/wiki/Cloture \"Cloture\"), which would have ended the filibuster,\nreceived 54 votes to 36 for cloture,[153] failing to receive the then required\ntwo-thirds majority of senators voting.[155] A second motion for cloture on\nSeptember 29, 1970 also failed, by 53 to 34. Thereafter, the Senate Majority\nLeader, [Mike Mansfield](/wiki/Mike_Mansfield \"Mike Mansfield\") of Montana,\nmoved to lay the proposal aside so the Senate could attend to other\nbusiness.[156] However, the proposal was never considered again and died when\nthe 91st Congress ended on January 3, 1971.\n\n#### Carter\nproposal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=47\n\"Edit section: Carter proposal\")]\n\nOn March 22, 1977, President Jimmy Carter wrote a letter of reform to Congress\nthat also included his expression of essentially abolishing the Electoral\nCollege. The letter read in part:\n\n> My fourth recommendation is that the Congress adopt a Constitutional\n> amendment to provide for direct popular election of the President. Such an\n> amendment, which would abolish the Electoral College, will ensure that the\n> candidate chosen by the voters actually becomes President. Under the\n> Electoral College, it is always possible that the winner of the popular vote\n> will not be elected. This has already happened in three elections, 1824,\n> 1876, and 1888. In the last election, the result could have been changed by\n> a small shift of votes in Ohio and Hawaii, despite a popular vote difference\n> of 1.7 million. I do not recommend a Constitutional amendment lightly. I\n> think the amendment process must be reserved for an issue of overriding\n> governmental significance. But the method by which we elect our President is\n> such an issue. I will not be proposing a specific direct election amendment.\n> I prefer to allow the Congress to proceed with its work without the\n> interruption of a new proposal.[157]\n\nPresident Carter's proposed program for the reform of the Electoral College\nwas very liberal for a modern President during this time, and in some aspects\nof the package, went beyond original expectations.[158] Newspapers like [The\nNew York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\") saw President\nCarter's proposal at that time as \"a modest surprise\" because of the\nindication of President Carter that he would be interested in only eliminating\nthe electors but retaining the electoral vote system in a modified form.[158]\n\nNewspaper reaction to President Carter's proposal ranged from some editorials\npraising the proposal to other editorials, like that in the _[Chicago\nTribune](/wiki/Chicago_Tribune \"Chicago Tribune\")_ , criticizing the President\nfor proposing the end of the Electoral College.[159]\n\nIn a letter to The New York Times, Representative [Jonathan B.\nBingham](/wiki/Jonathan_B._Bingham \"Jonathan B. Bingham\") highlighted the\ndanger of the \"flawed, outdated mechanism of the Electoral College\" by\nunderscoring how a shift of less than 10,000 votes in two key states would\nhave led to President Gerald Ford being reelected despite Jimmy Carter's\nnationwide 1.7 million-vote margin.[160]\n\n#### Current\nproposal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=48\n\"Edit section: Current proposal\")]\n\nOn January 5, 2017, Representative [Steve Cohen](/wiki/Steve_Cohen \"Steve\nCohen\") introduced a [joint resolution](/wiki/Joint_resolution \"Joint\nresolution\") proposing a constitutional amendment that would replace the\nElectoral College with the popular election of the President and Vice\nPresident.[161] Unlike the Bayh–Celler amendment 40% threshold for election,\nCohen's proposal only requires a candidate to have the \"greatest number of\nvotes\" to be elected.[162]\n\n### National Popular Vote Interstate\nCompact[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=49\n\"Edit section: National Popular Vote Interstate Compact\")]\n\nMain article: [National Popular Vote Interstate\nCompact](/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact \"National Popular Vote\nInterstate Compact\")\n\nSeveral states plus the District of Columbia have joined the National Popular\nVote Interstate Compact. Those jurisdictions joining the\n[compact](/wiki/Interstate_compact \"Interstate compact\") agree to pledge their\nelectors to the winner of the national [popular vote](/wiki/Direct_election\n\"Direct election\"). The Compact will not come into\n[effect](/wiki/Coming_into_force \"Coming into force\") until the number of\nstates agreeing to the Compact equals a majority (at least 270) of all\nelectors. As of 2017, 10 states and the [District of\nColumbia](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\") have joined the compact;\ncollectively, these jurisdictions control 165 electoral votes, which is 61% of\nthe 270 required for the Compact to take effect.[163] Only strongly [\"blue\"\nstates](/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states \"Red states and blue states\") have\njoined the compact, each of which returned large victory margins for Barack\nObama in the 2012 election.[164]\n\nThe Compact is based on the current rule in [Article II, Section 1, Clause\n2](/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_2:_Method_of_choosing_electors\n\"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") of the Constitution that\ngives each state legislature the [plenary power](/wiki/Plenary_power \"Plenary\npower\") to determine how it chooses its electors, though some have suggested\nthat [Article I, Section 10, Clause\n3](/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_10:_Limits_on_the_States\n\"Article One of the United States Constitution\") of the Constitution requires\n[congressional](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") consent\nbefore the Compact could be enforceable.[165] Some scholars note that any\nattempted implementation of the NPV interstate compact would face court\nchallenges to its constitutionality. Not only are states forbidden to enter\ninto any agreement or compact with another state without consent of Congress,\nbut it would overturn the Constitutional provision of electing a president of\nthe United States by the people state by state.[166]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=50\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [County Unit System](/wiki/County_Unit_System \"County Unit System\")\n  * Lists of United States presidential electors: [2000](/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_electors,_2000 \"List of United States presidential electors, 2000\"), [2004](/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_electors,_2004 \"List of United States presidential electors, 2004\"), [2008](/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_electors,_2008 \"List of United States presidential electors, 2008\"), [2012](/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_electors,_2012 \"List of United States presidential electors, 2012\"), [2016](/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_electors,_2016 \"List of United States presidential electors, 2016\")\n  * United States presidential elections: [1824](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824 \"United States presidential election, 1824\"), [1876](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1876 \"United States presidential election, 1876\"), [1888](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1888 \"United States presidential election, 1888\"), [2000](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000 \"United States presidential election, 2000\"), [2016](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016 \"United States presidential election, 2016\")\n  * [United States presidential election maps](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_maps \"United States presidential election maps\")\n  * [Voter turnout in the United States presidential elections](/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections \"Voter turnout in the United States presidential elections\")\n  * [List of U.S. states and territories by population](/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population \"List of U.S. states and territories by population\")\n  * [Number of Electoral Votes Per Popular Vote](/wiki/Number_of_Electoral_Votes_Per_Popular_Vote \"Number of Electoral Votes Per Popular Vote\")\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)&action=edit&section=51\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Bromwich, Jonah Engel (November 8, 2016).
