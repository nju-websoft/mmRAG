This foreign\npresence marks the only time in Japan's history that it has been occupied by a\nforeign power.[1] The country became a [parliamentary\ndemocracy](/wiki/Parliamentary_system \"Parliamentary system\") that recalled\n\"[New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\")\" priorities of the 1930s by\n[Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D.

Dower\"), in his book\n_Cultures of War: Pearl Harbor/Hiroshima/9-11/Iraq_ , the factors behind the\nsuccess of the occupation were:\n\n> Discipline, moral legitimacy, well-defined and well-articulated objectives,\n> a clear chain of command, tolerance and flexibility in policy formulation\n> and implementation, confidence in the ability of the state to act\n> constructively, the ability to operate abroad free of partisan politics back\n> home, and the existence of a stable, resilient, sophisticated civil society\n> on the receiving end of occupation policies – these political and civic\n> virtues helped make it possible to move decisively during the brief window\n> of a few years when defeated Japan itself was in flux and most receptive to\n> radical change.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Japanese surrender\n    * 1.1 Initial phase\n    * 1.2 SCAP\n    * 1.3 Organs running in parallel to SCAP\n  * 2 Outcomes\n    * 2.1 Disarmament\n    * 2.2 Liberalization\n    * 2.3 Emphasis on stability and economic growth\n    * 2.4 Democratization\n    * 2.5 Trade Union Act\n    * 2.6 Labor Standards Act\n    * 2.7 Education reform\n    * 2.8 Women's rights\n    * 2.9 Release of political prisoners\n  * 3 Impact\n    * 3.1 War criminals\n    * 3.2 Rape\n    * 3.3 Censorship\n    * 3.4 Industrial disarmament\n    * 3.5 Prostitution\n    * 3.6 Expulsions\n    * 3.7 Soviet activity\n  * 4 Politics\n  * 5 Japanese American contribution\n  * 6 End of the occupation\n  * 7 Criticism\n  * 8 Cultural reaction\n  * 9 Japanese women\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n    * 11.1 Citations\n    * 11.2 Sources\n  * 12 Further reading\n  * 13 External links\n\n## Japanese\nsurrender[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Japanese surrender\")]\n\nMain article: [Surrender of Japan](/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan \"Surrender of\nJapan\")\n\n### Initial\nphase[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Initial phase\")]\n\nJapan surrendered to the Allies on August 14, 1945, when the Japanese\ngovernment notified the Allies that it had accepted the [Potsdam\nDeclaration](/wiki/Potsdam_Declaration \"Potsdam Declaration\"). On the\nfollowing day, Emperor [Hirohito](/wiki/Hirohito \"Hirohito\") announced Japan's\nunconditional surrender on the radio (the _[Gyokuon-\nhōsō](/wiki/Gyokuon-h%C5%8Ds%C5%8D \"Gyokuon-hōsō\")_). The announcement was the\nemperor's first ever planned radio broadcast and the first time most citizens\nof Japan ever heard their sovereign's voice.[5] This date is known as Victory\nover Japan, or [V-J Day](/wiki/Victory_over_Japan_Day \"Victory over Japan\nDay\"), and marked the end of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\")\nand the beginning of a long road to recovery for a shattered Japan. Japanese\nofficials left for [Manila](/wiki/Manila \"Manila\"), Philippines on August 19\nto meet MacArthur and to be briefed on his plans for the occupation. On August\n28, 1945, 150 US personnel flew to [Atsugi](/wiki/Atsugi \"Atsugi\"), [Kanagawa\nPrefecture](/wiki/Kanagawa_Prefecture \"Kanagawa Prefecture\"). They were\nfollowed by [USS _Missouri_](/wiki/USS_Missouri_\\(BB-63\\) \"USS Missouri\n\\(BB-63\\)\"),[6] whose accompanying vessels landed the [4th Marine\nDivision](/wiki/US_4th_Marine_Division \"US 4th Marine Division\") on the\nsouthern coast of Kanagawa. Other Allied personnel followed.\n\nMacArthur arrived in [Tokyo](/wiki/Tokyo \"Tokyo\") on August 30, and\nimmediately decreed several laws. No Allied personnel were to assault Japanese\npeople. No Allied personnel were to eat the scarce Japanese food. Flying the\n_[Hinomaru](/wiki/Hinomaru \"Hinomaru\")_ or \"Rising Sun\" flag was initially\nseverely restricted (although individuals and prefectural offices could apply\nfor permission to fly it). This restriction was partially lifted in 1948 and\ncompletely lifted the following year.[7]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Instrument_of_surrender_Japan2.jpg/220px-\nInstrument_of_surrender_Japan2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Instrument_of_surrender_Japan2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Instrument_of_surrender_Japan2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe instrument of surrender, dated September 2, 1945\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Surrender_of_Japan_-\n_USS_Missouri.jpg/220px-Surrender_of_Japan_-\n_USS_Missouri.jpg)](/wiki/File:Surrender_of_Japan_-_USS_Missouri.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Surrender_of_Japan_-_USS_Missouri.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRepresentatives of the Empire of Japan stand aboard the [USS\n_Missouri_](/wiki/USS_Missouri_\\(BB-63\\) \"USS Missouri \\(BB-63\\)\") prior to\nsigning of the Instrument of Surrender.\n\nOn September 2, 1945, Japan formally surrendered with the signing of the\n[Japanese Instrument of Surrender](/wiki/Japanese_Instrument_of_Surrender\n\"Japanese Instrument of Surrender\"). On September 6, US President Truman\napproved a document titled \"[US Initial Post-Surrender Policy for\nJapan](/wiki/US_Initial_Post-Surrender_Policy_for_Japan \"US Initial Post-\nSurrender Policy for Japan\")\".[8] The document set two main objectives for the\noccupation: (1) eliminating Japan's war potential and (2) turning Japan into a\n[democratic-style](/wiki/Democracy \"Democracy\") nation with pro-United Nations\norientation. Allied (primarily American) forces were set up to supervise the\ncountry, and \"for eighty months following its surrender in 1945, Japan was at\nthe mercy of an army of occupation, its people subject to foreign military\ncontrol.\"[9] At the head of the Occupation administration was General\nMacArthur, who was technically supposed to defer to an advisory council set up\nby the Allied powers, but in practice did not and did everything himself. As a\nresult, this period was one of significant American influence, described near\nthe end of the occupation in 1951 that \"for six years the United States has\nhad a free hand to experiment with Japan than any other country in Asia, or\nindeed in the entire world.\"[10] Looking back to his work among the Japanese,\nMacArthur said, \"Measured by the standards of modern civilization, they would\nbe like a boy of twelve\" compared to the maturity of the US and Germany, and\nhad a good chance of putting away their troubled past.[11]\n\n[![two men standing in a black and white\nportrait](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Macarthur_hirohito.jpg/170px-\nMacarthur_hirohito.jpg)](/wiki/File:Macarthur_hirohito.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Macarthur_hirohito.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Gaetano Faillace](/wiki/Gaetano_Faillace \"Gaetano Faillace\")'s photo of\nDouglas MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito\n\n### SCAP[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: SCAP\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/The_first_proposals_for_the_division_of_Japan_-\n_WW2.png/220px-The_first_proposals_for_the_division_of_Japan_-\n_WW2.png)](/wiki/File:The_first_proposals_for_the_division_of_Japan_-_WW2.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_first_proposals_for_the_division_of_Japan_-_WW2.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe first proposals for the division of Japan\n\nOn V-J Day, US President [Harry Truman](/wiki/Harry_Truman \"Harry Truman\")\nappointed General [Douglas MacArthur](/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur \"Douglas\nMacArthur\") as [Supreme Commander for the Allied\nPowers](/wiki/Supreme_Commander_for_the_Allied_Powers \"Supreme Commander for\nthe Allied Powers\") (SCAP), to supervise the occupation of Japan. During the\nwar, the Allied Powers had planned to divide Japan amongst themselves for the\npurposes of occupation, as was done for the [occupation of\nGermany](/wiki/Occupation_of_Germany \"Occupation of Germany\"). Under the final\nplan, however, SCAP was given direct control over the main islands of Japan\n([Honshu](/wiki/Honshu \"Honshu\"), [Hokkaido](/wiki/Hokkaido \"Hokkaido\"),\n[Shikoku](/wiki/Shikoku \"Shikoku\"), and [Kyushu](/wiki/Kyushu \"Kyushu\")) and\nthe immediately surrounding islands, while outlying possessions were divided\nbetween the Allied Powers as follows:\n\n  * [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\"): [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea \"North Korea\") (not a full occupation), [South Sakhalin](/wiki/South_Sakhalin \"South Sakhalin\"), and the [Kuril Islands](/wiki/Kuril_Islands \"Kuril Islands\")\n  * [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"): [South Korea](/wiki/South_Korea \"South Korea\") (not a full occupation), [Okinawa](/wiki/Okinawa \"Okinawa\"), the [Amami Islands](/wiki/Amami_Islands \"Amami Islands\"), the [Ogasawara Islands](/wiki/Ogasawara_Islands \"Ogasawara Islands\") and Japanese possessions in [Micronesia](/wiki/Micronesia \"Micronesia\")\n  * [China](/wiki/Republic_of_China_\\(1912%E2%80%9349\\) \"Republic of China \\(1912–49\\)\"): [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan_after_World_War_II \"Taiwan after World War II\") and [Penghu](/wiki/Penghu \"Penghu\")\n\nIt is unclear why the occupation plan was changed. Common theories include the\nincreased power of the United States following development of the [atomic\nbomb](/wiki/Atomic_bomb \"Atomic bomb\"), Truman's greater distrust of the\nSoviet Union when compared with Roosevelt, and an increased desire to restrict\nSoviet influence in [East Asia](/wiki/East_Asia \"East Asia\") after the [Yalta\nConference](/wiki/Yalta_Conference \"Yalta Conference\").\n\nThe Soviet Union had some intentions of occupying Hokkaidō.[12] Had this\noccurred, there might have eventually been a [communist\nstate](/wiki/Communist_state \"Communist state\") in the Soviet zone of\noccupation. However, unlike the [Soviet occupations](/wiki/Soviet_occupations\n\"Soviet occupations\") of [East Germany](/wiki/East_Germany \"East Germany\") and\n[North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea \"North Korea\"), these plans were frustrated by\nTruman's opposition.[12]\n\nMacArthur's first priority was to set up a food distribution network;\nfollowing the collapse of the ruling government and the wholesale destruction\nof most major cities, virtually everyone was starving. Even with these\nmeasures, millions of people were still on the brink of starvation for several\nyears after the surrender.[13] As expressed by Kawai Kazuo, \"Democracy cannot\nbe taught to a starving people\".[14] The US government encouraged democratic\nreform in Japan, and while it sent billions of dollars in food aid, this was\ndwarfed by the occupation costs it imposed on the struggling Japanese\nadministration.[15][16]\n\n![File:Gaetano Faillace - Occupied Tokyo -\nfilm.webm](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Gaetano_Faillace_-\n_Occupied_Tokyo_-_film.webm/220px-seek%3D1-Gaetano_Faillace_-_Occupied_Tokyo_-\n_film.webm.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Gaetano_Faillace_-\n_Occupied_Tokyo_-_film.webm \"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gaetano_Faillace_-_Occupied_Tokyo_-_film.webm \"Enlarge\")\n\nHalf destroyed Tokyo as filmed by [Gaetano Faillace](/wiki/Gaetano_Faillace\n\"Gaetano Faillace\")\n\nInitially, the US government provided emergency food relief through Government\nand Relief in Occupied Areas ([GARIOA](/wiki/GARIOA \"GARIOA\")) funds. In\nfiscal year 1946, this aid amounted to US$92 million in loans. From April\n1946, in the guise of [Licensed Agencies for Relief in\nAsia](/wiki/Licensed_Agencies_for_Relief_in_Asia \"Licensed Agencies for Relief\nin Asia\"), private relief organizations were also permitted to provide relief.\nOnce the food network was in place MacArthur set out to win the support of\nHirohito. The two men met for the first time on September 27; the photograph\nof the two together is one of the most famous in Japanese history. Some were\nshocked that MacArthur wore his standard duty uniform with no tie instead of\nhis dress uniform when meeting the emperor. With the sanction of Japan's\nreigning monarch, MacArthur had the ammunition he needed to begin the real\nwork of the occupation. While other Allied political and military leaders\npushed for Hirohito to be tried as a [war criminal](/wiki/War_crimes \"War\ncrimes\"), MacArthur resisted such calls, arguing that any such prosecution\nwould be overwhelmingly unpopular with the Japanese people. He also rejected\nthe claims of members of the imperial family such as [Prince\nMikasa](/wiki/Prince_Mikasa \"Prince Mikasa\") and [Prince\nHigashikuni](/wiki/Prince_Higashikuni \"Prince Higashikuni\") and demands of\nintellectuals like [Tatsuji Miyoshi](/wiki/Tatsuji_Miyoshi \"Tatsuji Miyoshi\"),\nwho sought the emperor's abdication.[17]\n\nBy the end of 1945, more than 350,000 US personnel were stationed throughout\nJapan. By the beginning of 1946, replacement troops began to arrive in the\ncountry in large numbers and were assigned to MacArthur's [Eighth\nArmy](/wiki/Eighth_United_States_Army \"Eighth United States Army\"),\nheadquartered in Tokyo's [Dai-Ichi](/wiki/DN_Tower_21 \"DN Tower 21\") building.\nOf the main Japanese islands, [Kyūshū](/wiki/Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB \"Kyūshū\") was\noccupied by the [24th Infantry Division](/wiki/U.S._24th_Infantry_Division\n\"U.S. 24th Infantry Division\"), with some responsibility for\n[Shikoku](/wiki/Shikoku \"Shikoku\").

When North Korea invaded\nSouth Korea in the [Korean War](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\"), elements of\nthe 24th Division were flown into South Korea to try to fight the invasion\nforce there, but the inexperienced occupation troops, while acquitting\nthemselves well when suddenly thrown into combat almost overnight, suffered\nheavy casualties and were forced into retreat until other Japan occupation\ntroops could be sent to assist.\n\n### Organs running in parallel to\nSCAP[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Organs running in parallel to SCAP\")]\n\nThe official [British Commonwealth Occupation\nForce](/wiki/British_Commonwealth_Occupation_Force \"British Commonwealth\nOccupation Force\") (BCOF), composed of\n[Australian](/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force \"Australian Defence Force\"),\n[British](/wiki/British_Armed_Forces \"British Armed Forces\"),\n[Indian](/wiki/British_Indian_Army \"British Indian Army\") and [New\nZealand](/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force \"New Zealand Defence Force\")\npersonnel, was deployed on February 21, 1946. While US forces were responsible\nfor the overall occupation, BCOF was responsible for supervising\ndemilitarization and the disposal of Japan's war industries.[18] BCOF was also\nresponsible for occupation of several western prefectures and had its\nheadquarters at [Kure](/wiki/Kure,_Hiroshima \"Kure, Hiroshima\"). At its peak,\nthe force numbered about 40,000 personnel. During 1947, BCOF began to decrease\nits activities in Japan, and officially wound up in 1951.\n\nThe [Far Eastern Commission](/wiki/Far_Eastern_Commission \"Far Eastern\nCommission\") and Allied Council for Japan were also established to supervise\nthe occupation of Japan.[19] The establishment of a multilateral Allied\ncouncil for Japan was proposed by the Soviet government as early as September\n1945, and was supported partially by the British, French and Chinese\ngovernments.[20]\n\n##\nOutcomes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Outcomes\")]\n\n![File:1946-06-20 Japan\nToday.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/1946-06-20_Japan_Today.ogv/220px\n--1946-06-20_Japan_Today.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/1946-06-20_Japan_Today.ogv\n\"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:1946-06-20_Japan_Today.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\n1946 newsreel\n\n###\nDisarmament[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Disarmament\")]\n\nJapan's postwar [constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan \"Constitution of\nJapan\"), adopted under Allied supervision, included a \"Peace Clause\", [Article\n9](/wiki/Article_9_of_the_Japanese_Constitution \"Article 9 of the Japanese\nConstitution\"), which renounced war and banned Japan from maintaining any\narmed forces. This clause was not imposed by the Allies: rather, it was the\nwork of the Japanese government itself, and according to most sources, was the\nwork of Prime Minister [Kijūrō Shidehara](/wiki/Kij%C5%ABr%C5%8D_Shidehara\n\"Kijūrō Shidehara\").[21][22] The clause was intended to prevent the country\nfrom ever becoming an aggressive military power again. However, the United\nStates was soon pressuring Japan to rebuild its army as a bulwark against\n[communism](/wiki/Communism \"Communism\") in Asia after the [Chinese Civil\nWar](/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War \"Chinese Civil War\") and the [Korean\nWar](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\"). During the Korean War, US forces largely\nwithdrew from Japan to redeploy to South Korea, leaving the country almost\ntotally defenseless. As a result, a new [National Police\nReserve](/wiki/National_Police_Reserve \"National Police Reserve\") armed with\nmilitary-grade weaponry was created. In 1954, the [Japan Self-Defense\nForces](/wiki/Japan_Self-Defense_Forces \"Japan Self-Defense Forces\") were\nfounded as a full-scale military in all but name. To avoid breaking the\nconstitutional prohibition on military force, they were officially founded as\nan extension to the police force. Traditionally, Japan's military spending has\nbeen restricted to about 1% of its [gross national\nproduct](/wiki/Gross_national_product \"Gross national product\"), though this\nis by popular practice, not law, and has [fluctuated up and\ndown](/wiki/Defense_budget_of_Japan \"Defense budget of Japan\") from this\nfigure. [Prime Ministers](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan \"Prime Minister of\nJapan\") [Junichiro Koizumi](/wiki/Junichiro_Koizumi \"Junichiro Koizumi\") and\n[Shinzo Abe](/wiki/Shinzo_Abe \"Shinzo Abe\"), among others, have tried to\nrepeal or amend the clause. The JSDF slowly grew to considerable strength, and\nJapan now has the [eighth largest military\nbudget](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditure \"List of countries by\nmilitary expenditure\") in the world.[23]\n\n###\nLiberalization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Liberalization\")]\n\nAll the major sectors of the Japanese society, government, and economy were\nliberalized in the first few years and won strong support from\n[liberals](/wiki/Liberalism \"Liberalism\") in Japan.[24] Historians emphasize\nthe similarity to the American [New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\") programs\nof the 1930s.[25] Moore and Robinson note that, \"New Deal liberalism seemed\nnatural, even to conservative Republicans such as MacArthur and\n[Whitney](/wiki/Courtney_Whitney \"Courtney Whitney\").\"[26] The issuing of the\n[Removal of Restrictions on Political, Civil, and Religious\nLiberties](/wiki/Removal_of_Restrictions_on_Political,_Civil,_and_Religious_Liberties\n\"Removal of Restrictions on Political, Civil, and Religious Liberties\")\ndirective by SCAP on October 4, 1945, led to the abolishment of the [Peace\nPreservation Law](/wiki/Peace_Preservation_Law \"Peace Preservation Law\") and\nthe release of all political prisoners.[27][28]\n\n### Emphasis on stability and economic\ngrowth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Emphasis on stability and economic growth\")]\n\nFrom late 1947, US priorities shifted to internal political stability and\neconomic growth. Economic deconcentration, for example, was left uncompleted\nas GHQ responded to new imperatives. American authorities encouraged business\npractices and industrial policies that have since become sources of contention\nbetween Japan and its major trade partners, notably the United States.[29]\nDuring the occupation, GHQ/SCAP mostly abolished many of the financial\ncoalitions known as the [Zaibatsu](/wiki/Zaibatsu \"Zaibatsu\"), which had\npreviously monopolized industry.[30] Along with the later American change of\nheart, and due in part to the need for an economically stronger Japan in the\nface of a perceived Soviet threat, these economic reforms were also hampered\nby the wealthy and influential Japanese who stood to lose a great deal. As\nsuch, there were those who consequently resisted any attempts at reform,\nclaiming that the zaibatsu were required for Japan to compete internationally,\nand looser industrial groupings known as [keiretsu](/wiki/Keiretsu \"Keiretsu\")\nevolved. A major [land reform](/wiki/Land_reform \"Land reform\") was also\nconducted, led by [Wolf Ladejinsky](/wiki/Wolf_Ladejinsky \"Wolf Ladejinsky\")\nof General [Douglas MacArthur](/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur \"Douglas MacArthur\")'s\n[SCAP](/wiki/Supreme_Commander_of_the_Allied_Powers \"Supreme Commander of the\nAllied Powers\") staff. However, Ladejinsky has stated that the real architect\nof reform was [Hiro Wada](/w/index.php?title=Hiro_Wada&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Hiro Wada \\(page does not exist\\)\"), former Japanese [Minister of\nAgriculture](/wiki/Minister_of_Agriculture \"Minister of Agriculture\").[31]\nBetween 1947 and 1949, approximately 5,800,000 acres (23,000 km2) of land\n(approximately 38% of Japan's cultivated land) were purchased from the\n[landlords](/wiki/Landlord \"Landlord\") under the government's reform program\nand resold at extremely low prices (after inflation) to the farmers who worked\nthem. By 1950, three million peasants had acquired land, dismantling a power\nstructure that the landlords had long dominated.[32]\n\n###\nDemocratization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Democratization\")]\n\nIn 1946, the Diet ratified a new [Constitution of\nJapan](/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan \"Constitution of Japan\") that followed\nclosely a 'model copy' prepared by the GHQ/SCAP,[33] and was promulgated as an\namendment to the old [Prussian](/wiki/Prussia \"Prussia\")-style [Meiji\nConstitution](/wiki/Meiji_Constitution \"Meiji Constitution\"). The new\nconstitution drafted by Americans allowed access and control over the Japanese\nmilitary through MacArthur and the Allied occupation on Japan.[34] \"The\npolitical project drew much of its inspiration from the [U.S. Bill of\nRights](/wiki/US_Bill_of_Rights \"US Bill of Rights\"), [New\nDeal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\") social legislation, the [liberal\nconstitutions](/wiki/Liberal_constitution \"Liberal constitution\") of several\nEuropean states and even the Soviet Union.... (It) transferred sovereignty\nfrom the Emperor to the people in an attempt to depoliticize the Throne and\nreduce it to the status of a state symbol. Included in the revised charter was\nthe famous 'no war', 'no arms' Article Nine, which outlawed belligerency as an\ninstrument of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The 1947\nConstitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights,\nstrengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the\npolice and local government.\"[35] One example of MacArthur's push towards\ndemocratization implemented the land reform and redistribution of ownership\nwithin the agricultural system.[36] The land reform was established in order\nto improve not only the economy but the welfare of farmers as well.[37]\nMacArthur's land reform policy redistribution resulted in only 10% of the land\nbeing worked by non-owners.[36] On December 15, 1945, the [Shinto\nDirective](/wiki/Shinto_Directive \"Shinto Directive\") was issued abolishing\n[Shinto](/wiki/Shinto \"Shinto\") as a [state religion](/wiki/State_religion\n\"State religion\") and prohibiting some of its teachings and rites that were\ndeemed to be militaristic or ultra-nationalistic. On April 10, 1946, an\nelection with 78.52% voter turnout among men and 66.97% among women[38] gave\nJapan its first modern prime minister, [Shigeru Yoshida](/wiki/Shigeru_Yoshida\n\"Shigeru Yoshida\").\n\n### Trade Union\nAct[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Trade Union Act\")]\n\nIn 1945 the Diet passed Japan's first ever trade union law protecting the\nrights of workers to form or join a union, to organize, and take industrial\naction. There had been pre-war attempts to do so, but none that were\nsuccessfully passed until the Allied occupation.[39] A new [Trade Union\nLaw](/wiki/Trade_Union_Act_of_1949 \"Trade Union Act of 1949\") was passed on\nJune 1, 1949, which remains in place to the present day. According to Article\n1 of the Act, the purpose of the act is to \"elevate the status of workers by\npromoting their being on equal standing with the employer\".[40]\n\n### Labor Standards\nAct[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Labor Standards Act\")]\n\nThe [Labor Standards Act](/wiki/Labor_Standards_Act_of_1947 \"Labor Standards\nAct of 1947\") was enacted on April 7, 1947, to govern working conditions in\nJapan. According to Article 1 of the Act, its goal is to ensure that \"Working\nconditions shall be those which should meet the needs of workers who live\nlives worthy of human beings.\"[41] Support stemming from the Allied occupation\nhas introduced better working conditions and pay for numerous employees in\nJapanese business.[36] This allowed for more sanitary and hygienic working\nenvironments along with welfare and government assistance for health\ninsurance, pensions plans and work involving other trained specialists.[36]\nWhile it was created while Japan was under occupation, the origins of the Act\nhave nothing to do with the occupation forces. It appears to have been the\nbrainchild of Kosaku Teramoto, a former member of the [Thought\nPolice](/wiki/Tokubetsu_K%C5%8Dt%C5%8D_Keisatsu \"Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu\"),\nwho had become the head of the Labor Standards section of the Welfare\nMinistry.[42]\n\n### Education\nreform[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Education reform\")]\n\nSee also: [Educational reform in occupied\nJapan](/wiki/Educational_reform_in_occupied_Japan \"Educational reform in\noccupied Japan\")\n\nBefore and during the war, [Japanese\neducation](/wiki/History_of_education_in_Japan \"History of education in\nJapan\") was based on the German system, with\n\"[Gymnasien](/wiki/Gymnasium_\\(Germany\\) \"Gymnasium \\(Germany\\)\")\" (selective\ngrammar schools) and universities to train students after primary school.\nDuring the occupation, Japan's secondary education system was changed to\nincorporate three-year junior high schools and senior high schools similar to\nthose in the US: junior high school became compulsory but senior high school\nremained optional. The [Imperial Rescript on\nEducation](/wiki/Imperial_Rescript_on_Education \"Imperial Rescript on\nEducation\") was repealed, and the Imperial University system reorganized. The\nlongstanding issue of [Japanese script reform](/wiki/Japanese_script_reform\n\"Japanese script reform\"), which had been planned for decades but continuously\nopposed by more conservative elements, was also resolved during this time. The\nJapanese written system was drastically reorganized with the [Tōyō\nkanji](/wiki/Japanese_script_reform#Tōyō_kanji \"Japanese script reform\")-list\nin 1946, predecessor of today's [Jōyō kanji](/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji \"Jōyō\nkanji\"), and orthography was greatly altered to reflect spoken usage.\n\n### Women's\nrights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Women's rights\")]\n\nPrior to [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), women in Japan\nwere denied the [right to vote](/wiki/Right_to_vote \"Right to vote\") and other\n[legal rights](/wiki/Legal_rights \"Legal rights\"). With the defeat of the\ntraditionalist government, the occupation authorities, on the order of general\n[Douglas MacArthur](/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur \"Douglas MacArthur\"), began\ndrafting a new [constitution for\nJapan](/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan#Drafting_process \"Constitution of Japan\")\nin February 1946. A subcommittee including two women, [Beate Sirota\nGordon](/wiki/Beate_Sirota_Gordon \"Beate Sirota Gordon\")[43] and economist\n[Eleanor Hadley](/wiki/Eleanor_Hadley \"Eleanor Hadley\"), was enlisted and\nassigned to writing the section of the constitution devoted to [civil\nrights](/wiki/Civil_rights \"Civil rights\") and [women's rights in\nJapan](/wiki/Women%27s_rights#Japan \"Women's rights\"). They played an integral\nrole, drafting the language regarding legal equality between men and women in\nJapan,[44] including Articles 14 and 24 on Equal Rights and Women's Civil\nRights.

The Japanese authorities\nset up a large system of prostitution facilities ([Recreation and Amusement\nAssociation](/wiki/Recreation_and_Amusement_Association \"Recreation and\nAmusement Association\"), or the RAA) in order to protect the population.\nAccording to [John W. Dower](/wiki/John_W._Dower \"John W. Dower\"), precisely\nas the Japanese government had hoped when it created the prostitution\nfacilities, while the RAA was in place \"the incidence of rape remained\nrelatively low given the huge size of the occupation force\".[55]:130 However,\nthere was a resulting large rise in venereal disease among the soldiers, which\nled MacArthur to close down the prostitution in early 1946.[56] The incidence\nof rape increased after the closure of the brothels, possibly eight-fold;\nDower states that \"According to one calculation the number of rapes and\nassaults on Japanese women amounted to around 40 _daily_ while the RAA was in\noperation, and then rose to an average of 330 a day after it was terminated in\nearly 1946.\"[57] Michael S. Molasky states that while rape and other violent\ncrime were widespread in naval ports like [Yokosuka](/wiki/Yokosuka\n\"Yokosuka\") and [Yokohama](/wiki/Yokohama \"Yokohama\") during the first few\nweeks of occupation, according to Japanese police reports and journalistic\nstudies, the number of incidents declined shortly after and they were not\ncommon on mainland Japan throughout the rest of occupation.[58] Two weeks into\nthe occupation, the Occupation administration began censoring all media. This\nincluded any mention of rape or other sensitive social issues.[59][60]\n\nAccording to Dower, \"more than a few incidents\" of assault and rape were never\nreported to the police.[61] According to Toshiyuki Tanaka, 76 cases of rape or\nrape-murder were reported on Okinawa during the first five years of\noccupation, but according to Tanaka this is \"but the tip of the iceberg\" as\nmost of the rapes went unreported.[62]\n\n###\nCensorship[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Censorship\")]\n\nSee also: [Censorship in Japan § Occupation of\nJapan](/wiki/Censorship_in_Japan#Occupation_of_Japan \"Censorship in Japan\"),\n[Rape during the occupation of Japan § Allied censorship of Japanese\nmedia](/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Japan#Allied_censorship_of_Japanese_media\n\"Rape during the occupation of Japan\"), and [Civil Censorship\nDetachment](/wiki/Civil_Censorship_Detachment \"Civil Censorship Detachment\")\n\nAfter the [surrender of Japan](/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan \"Surrender of Japan\")\nin 1945, the [Supreme Commander of the Allied\nPowers](/wiki/Supreme_Commander_of_the_Allied_Powers \"Supreme Commander of the\nAllied Powers\") abolished all forms of censorship and controls on [Freedom of\nSpeech](/wiki/Freedom_of_Speech \"Freedom of Speech\"), which was also\nintegrated into Article 21 of the 1947 [Constitution of\nJapan](/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan \"Constitution of Japan\"). However, press\ncensorship remained a reality in the post-war era, especially in matters of\npornography, and in political matters deemed subversive by the American\ngovernment during the occupation of Japan.\n\nThe Allied occupation forces suppressed news of criminal activities such as\nrape; on September 10, 1945, SCAP \"issued press and pre-censorship codes\noutlawing the publication of all reports and statistics 'inimical to the\nobjectives of the Occupation'.\"[63]\n\nAccording to David M. Rosenfeld:\n\n> Not only did Occupation censorship forbid criticism of the United States or\n> other Allied nations, but the mention of censorship itself was forbidden.\n> This means, as [Donald Keene](/wiki/Donald_Keene \"Donald Keene\") observes,\n> that for some producers of texts \"the Occupation censorship was even more\n> exasperating than Japanese military censorship had been because it insisted\n> that all traces of censorship be concealed.

The\nnecessary dismantling of Japanese industry was foreseen to have been achieved\nif Japanese standards of living had been reduced to those existing in Japan\nthe period 1930–1934.[65][66] In the end, the adopted program of de-\nindustrialization in Japan was implemented to a lesser degree than the similar\nU.S. [\"industrial disarmament\" program in\nGermany](/wiki/Industrial_plans_for_Germany \"Industrial plans for\nGermany\").[65] In view of the cost to American taxpayers for emergency food\naid to Japan, in April 1948 the Johnston Committee Report recommended that the\neconomy of Japan should instead be reconstructed. The report included\nsuggestions for reductions in war reparations, and a relaxation of the\n\"economic deconcentration\" policy. For the fiscal year of 1949 funds were\nmoved from the [GARIOA](/wiki/GARIOA \"GARIOA\") budget into an Economic\nRehabilitation in Occupied Areas (EROA) programme, to be used for the import\nof materials needed for [economic\nreconstruction](/wiki/Economic_reconstruction \"Economic reconstruction\").\n\n###\nProstitution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Prostitution\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Yasuura_House.jpg/220px-\nYasuura_House.jpg)](/wiki/File:Yasuura_House.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Yasuura_House.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAllied servicemen visit the [Special Comfort Facility\nAssociation](/wiki/Special_Comfort_Facility_Association \"Special Comfort\nFacility Association\").\n\nSee also: [Recreation and Amusement\nAssociation](/wiki/Recreation_and_Amusement_Association \"Recreation and\nAmusement Association\")\n\nWith the acceptance of the Allied occupation authorities, the Japanese\norganized a [brothel](/wiki/Brothel \"Brothel\") system for the benefit of the\nmore than 300,000 occupation troops. \"The strategy was, through the special\nwork of experienced women, to create a breakwater to protect regular women and\ngirls.\"\n\nIn December 1945, a senior officer with the Public Health and Welfare Division\nof the occupation's General Headquarters wrote regarding the typical\nprostitute: \"The girl is impressed into contracting by the desperate financial\nstraits of her parents and their urging, occasionally supplemented by her\nwillingness to make such a sacrifice to help her family\", he wrote. \"It is the\nbelief of our informants, however, that in urban districts the practice of\nenslaving girls, while much less prevalent than in the past, still exists. The\nworst victims ... were the women who, with no previous experience, answered\nthe ads calling for 'Women of the New Japan'.\"\n\nMacArthur issued an order, SCAPIN 642 (SCAP Instruction), on January 21 ending\nlicensed brothels for being \"in contravention of the ideals of democracy\".\nAlthough SCAPIN 642 ended the RAA's operations, it did not affect \"voluntary\nprostitution\" by individuals. Ultimately, SCAP responded by making all\nbrothels and other facilities offering prostitution off-limits to Allied\npersonnel on March 25, 1946.[67] By November, the Japanese government had\nintroduced the new [akasen](/wiki/Akasen \"Akasen\") (赤線, _\" red-line\"_) system\nin which prostitution was permissible only in certain designated\nareas.[68][69]\n\n###\nExpulsions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Expulsions\")]\n\nThe surrender of Imperial Japan meant reversal of its previous\nannexations—[Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria \"Manchuria\")\n([Manchukuo](/wiki/Manchukuo \"Manchukuo\") as a puppet regime under Japan) was\nreturned to [China](/wiki/Republic_of_China_\\(1912%E2%80%9349\\) \"Republic of\nChina \\(1912–49\\)\"), while [Korea](/wiki/Korea \"Korea\") regained its\nindependence and was [divided in two](/wiki/Division_of_Korea \"Division of\nKorea\") by the United States and Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviet Union claimed [South Sakhalin](/wiki/South_Sakhalin \"South\nSakhalin\") and the [Kuril Islands](/wiki/Kuril_Islands \"Kuril Islands\"), with\n400,000 Japanese fleeing or expelled.

Political parties had begun to revive\nalmost immediately after the occupation began. Left-wing organizations, such\nas the [Japan Socialist Party](/wiki/Japan_Socialist_Party \"Japan Socialist\nParty\") and the [Japan Communist Party](/wiki/Japan_Communist_Party \"Japan\nCommunist Party\"), quickly reestablished themselves, as did various\nconservative parties. The old [Seiyukai](/wiki/Seiyukai \"Seiyukai\") and\n[Rikken Minseito](/wiki/Rikken_Minseito \"Rikken Minseito\") came back as,\nrespectively, the [Liberal Party](/wiki/Liberal_Party_\\(Japan,_1945\\) \"Liberal\nParty \\(Japan, 1945\\)\") (Nihon Jiyuto) and the [Japan Progressive\nParty](/wiki/Shimpot%C5%8D \"Shimpotō\") (Nihon Shimpoto). The first postwar\nelections were held in 1946 (women were given the franchise for the first\ntime), and the Liberal Party's vice president, [Yoshida\nShigeru](/wiki/Yoshida_Shigeru \"Yoshida Shigeru\") (1878–1967), became [prime\nminister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan \"Prime Minister of Japan\").

This divisiveness in conservative ranks gave a plurality\nto the Japan Socialist Party, which was allowed to form a\n[cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Japan \"Cabinet of Japan\"), which lasted less than a\nyear. Thereafter, the socialist party steadily declined in its electoral\nsuccesses.

These\nblack markets in turn were often places of turf wars between rival gangs, like\nthe [Shibuya incident](/wiki/Shibuya_incident \"Shibuya incident\") in 1946.\n[Prostitution](/wiki/Prostitution \"Prostitution\") also increased considerably.\n\nIn the 1950s, [kasutori](/wiki/Kasutori \"Kasutori\") culture emerged. In\nresponse to the scarcity of the previous years, this sub-culture, named after\nthe preferred drink of the artists and writers who imbibed it, emphasized\nescapism, entertainment and decadence.[85]\n\nThe phrase \"[shikata ga nai](/wiki/Shikata_ga_nai \"Shikata ga nai\")\", or\n\"nothing can be done about it,\" was commonly used in both Japanese and\nAmerican press to encapsulate the Japanese public's resignation to the harsh\nconditions endured while under occupation. However, not everyone reacted the\nsame way to the hardships of the postwar period. While some succumbed to the\ndifficulties, many more were resilient. As the country regained its footing,\nthey were able to bounce back as well.\n\nLeftists looked upon the occupation forces as a \"liberation army\".[86]\n\n## Japanese\nwomen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Japanese women\")]\n\nIt has been argued that the granting of rights to women played an important\nrole in the radical shift Japan underwent from a war nation to a\n[democratized](/wiki/Democratization \"Democratization\") and\n[demilitarized](/wiki/Demilitarization \"Demilitarization\") country.[87] In the\nfirst postwar general elections of 1946, over a third of the votes were cast\nby women. This unexpectedly high female voter turnout led to the election of\n39 female candidates, and the increasing presence of women in politics was\nperceived by Americans as evidence of an improvement of Japanese women's\ncondition.[88]\n\nAmerican feminists saw Japanese women as victims of feudalistic and\nchauvinistic traditions that had to be broken by the Occupation. American\nwomen assumed a central role in the reforms that affected the lives of\nJapanese women: they educated Japanese about Western ideals of democracy, and\nit was an American woman who wrote the Japanese Equal Rights Amendment for the\nnew [constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan \"Constitution of Japan\").[89]\nGeneral [Douglas MacArthur](/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur \"Douglas MacArthur\") did\nnot mean for Japanese women to give up their central role in the home as wives\nand mothers, but rather that they could now assume other roles simultaneously,\nsuch as that of worker.[90][91]\n\nIn 1953, journalist Ichirō Narumigi commented that Japan had received\n\"liberation of sex\" along with the \"four presents\" that it had been granted by\nthe occupation (respect for [human rights](/wiki/Human_rights \"Human rights\"),\n[gender equality](/wiki/Gender_equality \"Gender equality\"), [freedom of\nspeech](/wiki/Freedom_of_speech \"Freedom of speech\"), and women’s\nenfranchisement).[92] Indeed, the occupation also had a great impact on\nrelationships between man and woman in Japan. The \"[modern\ngirl](/wiki/Modern_girl \"Modern girl\")\" phenomenon of the 1920s and early\n1930s had been characterized by greater sexual freedom, but despite this, sex\nwas usually not perceived as a source of pleasure (for women) in Japan.\nWesterners, as a result, were thought to be [promiscuous](/wiki/Promiscuity\n\"Promiscuity\") and sexually deviant.[93] The sexual liberation of European and\nNorth American women during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\")\nwas unthinkable in Japan, especially during wartime where rejection of Western\nways of life was encouraged.[94]\n\nThe Japanese public was thus astounded by the sight of some 45,000 so-called\n\"pan pan girls\" ([prostitutes](/wiki/Prostitution \"Prostitution\"))\nfraternizing with American soldiers during the occupation.[92] In 1946, the\n200 wives of US officers landing in Japan to visit their husbands also had a\nsimilar impact when many of these reunited couples were seen walking hand in\nhand and kissing in public.[95] Both prostitution and marks of affection had\nbeen hidden from the public until then, and this \"democratization of\neroticism\" was a source of surprise, curiosity, and even envy. The occupation\nset new models for relationships between Japanese men and women: the western\npractice of \"[dating](/wiki/Dating \"Dating\")\" spread, and activities such as\ndancing, movies and coffee were not limited to \"pan pan girls\" and American\ntroops anymore, and became popular among young Japanese couples.[96]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Valery Burati](/wiki/Valery_Burati \"Valery Burati\")\n  * [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\")\n  * [1945 in Japan](/wiki/1945_in_Japan \"1945 in Japan\")\n  * [Post-war Japan](/wiki/Post-war_Japan \"Post-war Japan\")\n  * [Japanese post-war economic miracle](/wiki/Japanese_post-war_economic_miracle \"Japanese post-war economic miracle\")\n  * [Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan](/wiki/Security_Treaty_Between_the_United_States_and_Japan \"Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan\")\n  * [1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement](/wiki/1971_Okinawa_Reversion_Agreement \"1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement\")\n  * [Shipping Control Authority for the Japanese Merchant Marine](/wiki/Shipping_Control_Authority_for_the_Japanese_Merchant_Marine \"Shipping Control Authority for the Japanese Merchant Marine\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n###\nCitations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Occupation_of_Japan&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Citations\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
