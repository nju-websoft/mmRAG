Sherman\") said he and\nhis brother aimed for a [jazz](/wiki/Jazz \"Jazz\") sound, with a\n[Dixieland](/wiki/Dixieland \"Dixieland\")-like melody. He added that \"When we\nfirst got an idea for 'I Wan'na Be Like You,' we said an ape swings from a\ntree, and he's the king of apes. We'll make him 'the king of the\n[swingers](/wiki/Swing_\\(dance\\) \"Swing \\(dance\\)\").' That's the idea, we'll\nmake him a jazz man.\" Once Prima was invited to do the song, he mockingly\nresponded to the Shermans with \"You want [to make a monkey out of\nme](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/make_a_monkey_out_of \"wikt:make a monkey\nout of\")? You got me!\" The instrumentals were originally recorded by Prima—who\nalso played the trumpet—and his band, [Sam Butera](/wiki/Sam_Butera \"Sam\nButera\") & The Witnesses, but the music was replaced by one written by the\nfilm's composer, [George Bruns](/wiki/George_Bruns \"George Bruns\"), and\norchestrated by Walter Sheets. The \"[scat](/wiki/Scat_singing \"Scat singing\")\ndialogue\" between Baloo and King Louie was the result of two recording\nsessions. Louis Prima recorded first, with the intent that Baloo—played in his\nrecording by Butera—would simply repeat what Louie scatted, but [Phil\nHarris](/wiki/Phil_Harris \"Phil Harris\") decided not to imitate Prima's\nrecording and made up his own. The song was released the same date as the\nmotion picture itself.[2][3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Cover versions\n  * 2 Robbie Williams version\n    * 2.1 Weekly charts\n  * 3 Uses in popular culture\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## Cover\nversions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Wan%27na_Be_like_You_\\(The_Monkey_Song\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Cover versions\")]\n\n  * [Kenny Ball](/wiki/Kenny_Ball \"Kenny Ball\") and His Jazzmen released a single of \"I Wanna Be like You\" (without an apostrophe in the title) in 1968[4] and it also featured on their 1969 album _King of the Swingers_.[5]\n  * [Pinky and Perky](/wiki/Pinky_and_Perky \"Pinky and Perky\") recorded a version for their _Film Parade_ album in 1970 and also released the song as a single.\n  * On the 1990 collection _[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films](/wiki/Stay_Awake:_Various_Interpretations_of_Music_from_Vintage_Disney_Films \"Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films\")_ , the song appears on \"Medley Two\" as recorded by [Los Lobos](/wiki/Los_Lobos \"Los Lobos\"), who play the song occasionally in their live shows.\n  * On 5 April 1994 [Phish](/wiki/Phish \"Phish\") performed a truly Phish-styled version at The Metropolis Concert Hall in [Montreal](/wiki/Montreal \"Montreal\"), [Quebec](/wiki/Quebec \"Quebec\").\n  * [Big Bad Voodoo Daddy](/wiki/Big_Bad_Voodoo_Daddy \"Big Bad Voodoo Daddy\") did a cover of the song on the _[Swingers](/wiki/Swingers_\\(1996_film\\) \"Swingers \\(1996 film\\)\")_ soundtrack, even though the song does not appear in the film.
