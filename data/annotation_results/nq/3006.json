RTI\nseeks to promote academic success through universal screening, early\nintervention, frequent progress monitoring, and increasingly intensive\nresearch-based instruction or interventions for children who continue to have\ndifficulty. RTI is a multileveled approach for aiding students that is\nadjusted and modified as needed if they are failing.\n\nIn terms of identifying students with [specific learning\ndisabilities](/wiki/Learning_disability \"Learning disability\") (SLD), RTI was\nproposed as an alternative to the ability–achievement discrepancy model, which\nrequires children to exhibit a significant discrepancy between their ability\n(often measured by [IQ testing](/wiki/Intelligence_quotient \"Intelligence\nquotient\")) and academic achievement (as measured by their grades and\nstandardized testing). Methods to identify students with SLD have been\ncontroversial for decades[1] and proponents of RTI claim that the process\nbrings more clarity to the Specific Learning Disability (SLD) category of the\n[Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement\nAct](/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act \"Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act\") (IDEA 2004), while opponents claim that RTI\nsimply identifies low achieving students rather than students with learning\ndisabilities.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Description\n    * 1.1 School-wide screening\n    * 1.2 Teaching\n    * 1.3 Progress monitoring and tiered service delivery\n      * 1.3.1 Tier 1\n      * 1.3.2 Tier 2\n      * 1.3.3 Tier 3\n    * 1.4 RTI implementation\n    * 1.5 Fidelity of implementation\n  * 2 Classification of RTI\n  * 3 Support for RTI\n  * 4 Relationship between IDEA and RTI\n    * 4.1 Evaluating SLD using RTI\n  * 5 Response to RTI\n  * 6 Concerns and criticisms of RTI for SLD classification\n  * 7 Technology application to RTI\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 Notes\n  * 10 General references\n  * 11 Further reading\n\n##\nDescription[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Description\")]\n\nRTI is originally a special education term that has broadened into general\neducation framework that involves research-based instruction and\ninterventions, regular monitoring of student progress, and the subsequent use\nof these data over time to make a variety of educational decisions, including,\nbut not limited to SLD eligibility.[2][3][4] To facilitate this broadened\nconception of RTI, a shift to labeling this as one of the approaches of a\nMulti-Tier System of Supports (MTSS) occurring in schools and the professional\nliterature.[5] Key to the RTI process is the application of scientifically\nbased interventions that have been demonstrated to work in [randomized\ncontrolled trials](/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial \"Randomized controlled\ntrial\"). A goal of the RTI process is to apply accountability to educational\nprogram by focusing on programs that work rather than programs that simply\nlook, sound, or feel good.\n\nRTI follows a number of core assumptions:[2]\n\n  1. The educational system can effectively teach all children\n  2. Early intervention is critical to preventing problems from getting out of control\n  3. The implementation of a multi-tiered service delivery model is necessary\n  4. A problem solving model should be used to make decisions between tiers\n  5. Research based interventions should be implemented to the extent possible\n  6. Progress monitoring must be implemented to inform instruction\n  7. Data should drive decision making\n\nA learning disability is defined as a neurological disorder that affects the\nbrain's ability to receive, process, store, and respond to information. They\nare a group of disorders that can impact many areas of learning, including\nreading, writing, spelling, math, listening, and oral expression.[6]\n\nIn the process of identifying learning disabilities, RTI differs from the\nformerly standard \"ability–achievement discrepancy\" approach in that decisions\nare based on outcomes of targeted interventions rather than mathematical\ndiscrepancies between scores achieved on standardized assessments.\n\nIn the RTI process, service delivery is typically divided into three levels\n(tiers) of support, with the intensity of interventions increasing with each\nlevel.[3][7] **Tier 1** is focused specifically within the core curriculum,\nwith instruction and interventions targeting all students. Approximately 80%\nto 85% of the general student body should be able to meet grade level norms\nwithout additional assistance beyond the first tier. Students who consistently\ndo not perform within the expected level of performance through Tier 1\ninstruction are then provided with additional supplementary interventions at\n**Tier 2** , which typically involves small group instruction. Approximately\n3% to 6% of students will continue to have difficulties after Tier 2\ninterventions; these students will then receive **Tier 3** intervention\nservices, which is the most intense level of intervention (often one-on-one)\nprovided in the regular education environment. As RTI is a regular education\ninitiative, all three tiers of services are intended to be provided as\nsupplements to, not replacements for, the regular education curriculum; there\nare some, however, who view Tier 3 as [special\neducation](/wiki/Special_education \"Special education\").[2][8]\n\n### School-wide\nscreening[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: School-wide screening\")]\n\nThe first level of data collected in the RTI process comes from universal\nschool-wide screenings. These screening assessments are typically given to all\nstudents within targeted grade levels, and cover basic academic subjects such\nas reading and mathematics. Most screening measures aim to be practical and\nefficient to administer, with the goal of identifying students who may require\nfurther assessments and interventions.\n\nTo evaluate student performance on the screening measures, scores are compared\nto specific criteria (_criterion referenced_) or to broad norms (_norm\nreferenced_). When specific criteria are used, _cut scores_ are established to\nevaluate students against a specific level of proficiency (e.g., achieving a\nscore of 15 or above); in a normative comparison, students' scores are\ncompared against those of a larger group (e.g., scoring above the 25th\npercentile compared to a national sample of 3rd grade students).\n\nScreenings usually occur three times per year (fall, winter, and spring), and\nthe data from these assessments help to guide instruction through the three\ntiers of the RTI process. This is important not only for identifying students\nwho are having difficulties, but also for identifying possible areas of\nimprovement in the general classroom instruction in the cases where too many\nstudents fall below expectations.[9] Because a single universal screening at\nthe beginning of the year can over-identify students who require preventative\nintervention, the National Research Center on Learning Disabilities recommends\nthat schools also integrate at least five weeks of weekly progress monitoring\nto identify students who require preventative intervention.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n###\nTeaching[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Teaching\")]\n\nCore curriculum in the classroom should be research-based and field tested.\nThis means, based on evidence from congregating research, that the core\ncurriculum contains all the fundamentals found necessary to efficiently teach\nreading and has a recognized record of achievement. Such curriculum is to be\ndelivered by \"highly qualified\" teachers adequately trained to deliver the\nselected instruction as intended, that is, with fidelity to design.\n\n### Progress monitoring and tiered service\ndelivery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Progress monitoring and tiered service delivery\")]\n\nProgress monitoring is a set of assessment procedures for determining the\nextent to which students are benefiting from classroom instruction and for\nmonitoring effectiveness of curriculum.\n\n[Curriculum-based measurement](/wiki/Curriculum-based_measurement \"Curriculum-\nbased measurement\") (CBM)[10] is often used to collect [data](/wiki/Data\n\"Data\") on interventions and their effectiveness to determine what works best\nfor an individual student. Additional methods are attempted until students\n\"respond\" to the intervention and improve their skills. Students that do not\nrespond, or respond at significantly low rates, may be deemed to have\nbiologically based learning disabilities, rather than simply learning\ndifficulties.\n\nProgress monitoring is the scientifically based practice of assessing\nstudents' academic performance on a regular basis for three purposes:\n\n  1. To determine whether children are profiting appropriately from the instructional program, including the curriculum\n  2. To build more effective programs for the children who do not benefit\n  3. To estimate rates of student improvement\n\nThree tiers of Scientifically Research-Based Interventions (SRBIs) of\nincreasing intensity incorporate the key components of RTI and help ensure the\nacademic growth and achievement of students.\n\n#### Tier\n1[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Tier 1\")]\n\nThe first tier states that all students receive core classroom instruction\nthat is [differentiated](/wiki/Differentiated_instruction \"Differentiated\ninstruction\") and utilizes strategies and materials that are scientifically\nresearch-based. Assessment in the classroom should be ongoing and effective in\nthat it clearly identifies the strengths and weaknesses for each learner. Any\nnecessary interventions at this level are within the framework of the general\neducation classroom and can be in the form of differentiated instruction,\nsmall group review, or one-on-one remediation of a concept.\n\nProgress monitoring in Tier 1 uses universal screening assessments to show\nindividual student growth over time and to determine whether students are\nprogressing as expected. In this process, data are collected, students are\nidentified using benchmark scores, and measurable goals are set for the next\ndata collection point for those who display difficulties. The team then\nfollows a problem-solving process to determine interventions for at-risk\nstudents that will work within whole-class instructions. The classroom teacher\nimplements the interventions, observations are conducted to ensure the\nfidelity of the classroom instruction, and the problem-solving team\nperiodically reviews the progress of students.\n\n#### Tier\n2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Tier 2\")]\n\nIn the second tier, supplemental interventions may occur within or outside of\nthe general education classroom, and progress monitoring occurs at more\nfrequent intervals. Core instruction is still delivered by the classroom\nteacher, but small groups of similar instructional levels may work together\nunder a teacher's instruction and/or guidance. This type of targeted\ninstruction is typically for 30 minutes per day, two to four days per week,\nfor a minimum of nine weeks. This targeted instruction may occur in the\ngeneral education setting or outside in a smaller group setting with a\nspecialized teacher (such as a Literacy Support teacher for struggling\nreaders).\n\nIn Tier 2, the main purpose of progress monitoring is to determine whether\ninterventions are successful in helping students learn at an appropriate rate.\nDecision rules are created to determine when a student might no longer require\nextra interventions, when the interventions need to be changed, or when a\nstudent might be identified for special education.\n\nOral language abilities at the onset of reading intervention programs are an\nexcellent predictor of final outcomes.[11] Both English as a first language\nand English-language learners demonstrate that the greater the oral language\nimpairment, the greater the associated growth from RTI.[11] Phonics-based RTI\nprograms are most effective prior to grade 1, however, after grade 1\ncomprehension and mixed RTI programs are associated with greater effect\nsizes.[12]\n\n#### Tier\n3[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Tier 3\")]\n\nTier three is for students who require more intense, explicit and\nindividualized instruction and have not shown sufficient response to Tier 1\nand Tier 2 interventions. This type of targeted instruction is delivered for a\nminimum of two 30-minute sessions every week for nine to twelve weeks. The\ninterventions in this tier may be similar to those in Tier 2 except that they\nare intensified in focus, frequency, and duration. The instruction in Tier 3\nis typically delivered outside of the general education classroom. Programs,\nstrategies, and procedures are designed and employed to supplement, enhance,\nand support Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruction by remediation of the relevant area\nand development of compensatory strategies. If Tier 3 is not successful, a\nchild is considered for the first time as potentially having a learning\ndisability.\n\nIn some cases, Tier 3 is considered to be [special\neducation](/wiki/Special_education \"Special education\"), with instruction\nbeing provided to individual students or small groups by special education\nteachers _in place of_ general education instruction (rather than as a\nsupplement). Initial goals are established through an [individualized\neducation program](/wiki/Individualized_education_program \"Individualized\neducation program\") (IEP), which is guided by the results of a comprehensive\nevaluation, and ongoing progress monitoring helps to direct the teaching\nprocess. Special education instruction likely will be considerably longer than\nthe 10 to 12 weeks of supplemental instruction delivered in Tier 2 and beyond.\nThe frequency of special education instruction depends upon student need, and\nthe criteria to exit special education are specified and monitored so that\nplacement can be flexible.\n\n### RTI\nimplementation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: RTI implementation\")]\n\nThe number of schools implementing RTI continues to grow and 61% of schools\nsurveyed in 2010 indicated that they had fully implemented or were in the\nprocess of implementing RTI.[13] However, most schools in the survey indicated\nthat the continued to focus on reading interventions at the elementary school.\nRTI is primarily implemented by grade-level teams or professional learning\ncommunities as part of a school-wide problem-solving plan, and previous\nresearch found that implementing RTI resulted in several positive outcomes\nsuch as reductions in students referred to and placed into special education,\nmore students passing state accountability tests, and increased academic\nskills among students at-risk for reading failure.[14]\n\n### Fidelity of\nimplementation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Fidelity of implementation\")]\n\nIn an RTI model, fidelity is important at both the school level (e.g.,\nimplementation of the process) and the teacher level (e.g., implementation of\ninstruction). Although the concept of fidelity of implementation is supported\nby research and is generally viewed as common sense, there are practical\nchallenges associated with achieving high levels of fidelity. Factors that can\nreduce fidelity when implementing instruction include:[15]\n\n  * Complexity of the interventions and the time required to implement them\n  * Inaccessibility of required materials and resources\n  * Low perceptions/expectations of effectiveness (teachers may not fully commit to an intervention if they believe that it will not be effective, or if it is inconsistent with their teaching style)\n  * Low numbers, expertise, and motivation of those who deliver the interventions\n\nFactors that can increase fidelity when implementing an RTI model include:[16]\n\n  * Well-functioning professional learning communities\n  * Using a universal screener that is brief, aligned with the curriculum, result in reliable data, and is validated for screening decisions\n  * Using a data-management system that is easily accessible by classroom teachers\n  * Implementing interventions that address the skill deficit of students\n  * Identifying and addressing class-wide needs\n  * Establishing well-defined decision rules\n  * Clear leadership from the building principal\n  * Ongoing training and professional development\n  * Key stakeholders working together in a flexible manner to improve student learning\n  * Use of standard-protocol interventions for tier 2\n  * Not making entitlement (i.e., special education disability identification) decisions until the RTI system is in place and well established.\n\n## Classification of\nRTI[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Classification of RTI\")]\n\nRTI is a general education process that is used in schools to ensure students\nreceive the supports they need to be successful and excel in school. In the\neducational literature, RTI is often referred to as a _Standard Protocol\nApproach_ , as a _Problem Solving Model._ ,[17] or as a hybrid of the two.\nHowever, some have challenged a dichotomous view of RTI because both models\nincorporate problem solving to identify the academic or social-emotional\ndifficulty the student is having and both use a systematic, universal\nscreening procedure during Tier 1 to determine which students are having\ndifficulties meeting age or grade level benchmarks for a specific skill.[18]\nTypically, [Curriculum Based Measurement](/wiki/Curriculum_Based_Measurement\n\"Curriculum Based Measurement\") (CBM) or other predictive data are used to\nflag the students who are not meeting expected levels of performance. In the\nproblem-solving model approach, the teacher typically refers the student to a\nproblem-solving team to ascertain the challenges a student is having within\nthe classroom. Using information collected from the classroom teacher and\nothers, observations, etc., the team determines what additional supports the\nstudent might need to address the learning gap. Standard-protocol approaches\ntend to rely more on grade-level teams and professional learning communities\nto make intervention decisions, but both approaches use a problem-solving\nprocedure to make decisions, which makes the distinction somewhat meaningless.\nMany schools rely on grade-level teams to make intervention decision and use a\nstandardized intervention for tier 2, but then rely on a problem-solving team\nto develop individualized interventions for tier 3.\n\nWhen a student is identified as having difficulties in school, a team provides\ninterventions of increasing intensity to help the child catch up with the rest\nof his or her peers. When students continue to struggle, even when appropriate\nevidence-based practices have been delivered with fidelity, students may be\nreferred for a special education evaluation. Parents can request a special\neducation evaluation at any time in this process, however. While the RTI\nprocess can be a way to ensure that each student is afforded the opportunity\nto learn, some opponents feel that it allows school districts to avoid or\ndelay identifying students who need special education services. Proponents\nwould point out that RTI is not the process of identifying students with a\nlearning disability by starting tiered interventions when a disability is\nsuspected, but is the process of examining data that already exist from\nimplementing a tiered intervention model, which should expedite the\nidentification process. The expected outcome of RTI is improved instruction\nthat will result in improved outcomes for all students[19]\n\n## Support for\nRTI[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Support for RTI\")]\n\nThere are at least four main reasons for implementing RTI: 1) to increase\nachievement for all students; 2) to reduce racial/ethnic disproportionate\nrepresentation of minority students in special education; 3) to increase\ncollaboration and integration of general and special education; 4) and to\nidentify students with learning disabilities through a different lens than the\nIQ-achievement discrepancy model.[20] RTI proponents claim that when\ninterventions work, fewer children, particularly minority children, are\nreferred for special education, and that the RTI model acts as a safeguard,\nensuring that a child is not given a label of a disability inappropriately. In\naddition, proponents state that RTI helps school districts by eliminating\nunnecessary referrals, which drain time and resources.[21] Critics express\nconcern, however, that in attempting to eliminate unnecessary referrals, RTI\nmay also delay or eliminate necessary referrals.\n\nProponents feel that response to intervention is the best opportunity for\ngiving all students the additional time and support needed to learn at high\nlevels,[22] and see great benefit in that it applies to the classroom\nteachers, paraeducators, counselors, and the administration. The RTI process\ncan help identify students who are at-risk, guide adjustments to instruction,\nmonitor student progress, and then make other recommendations as necessary.\nThe objective is that with minor adjustments or simple interventions, students\nmay respond and achieve at higher levels.\n\nRTI is also very useful when working with students who have severe emotional\nproblems. The structure and evaluation of RTI will help this particular group\nof students to be successful in the academic environment.[23]\n\nReading difficulties is one of the most common reasons students need\nintervention support. Reading goals can develop reading self-concept, which\ninfluence reading fluency skills and promotes the importance of goal setting\nin reading intervention programs.[24] It is imperative that students monitor\nthese goals and celebrate their progress. Students involved in multiple-\ncomponent reading intervention programs show significant improvement, and\nstudents in different socioeconomic, racial, and intellectual quotient groups\nmake equivalent gains.[25]\n\n## Relationship between IDEA and\nRTI[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Relationship between IDEA and RTI\")]\n\nThe [Individuals with Disabilities Education\nAct](/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act \"Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act\") (IDEA) was revised and signed into law in 2004\nand became effective in July 2006. According to the law, a specific learning\ndisability is a disorder of one or more of the basic psychological processes\nthat adversely affects academic achievement in one or more domains (e.g.,\nreading, writing, math, language). There are three methods of SLD\nidentification under IDEA, as defined in §300.8(c)(10) (OSERS Final\nRegulations-8/06):\n\n  1. a discrepancy between \"ability\" and \"achievement\"\n  2. failure to respond to scientific research-based intervention\n  3. alternative research-based procedures for determining whether a child has a specific learning disability\n\n(The \"third method\" is often considered a \"processing strengths and\nweaknesses\" model.)\n\nThe 2004 reauthorization of IDEA makes mention of RTI as a method of part of\nthe process of identifying SLD:\n\n  1. In diagnosing learning disabilities, schools are no longer required to use the discrepancy model. The act states that, \"a local educational agency shall not be required to take into consideration whether a child has a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability[...]\"\n  2. Response to intervention is specifically mentioned in the regulations in conjunction with the identification of a specific learning disability. IDEA 2004 states, \"a local educational agency may use a process that determines if the child responds to scientific, research-based intervention as a part of the evaluation procedures.\"\n  3. Early Intervening Services (EIS) are prominently mentioned in IDEA for the first time. These services are directed at interventions for students prior to referral in an attempt to avoid inappropriate classification, which proponents claim an RTI model does. IDEA now authorizes the use of up to 15% of IDEA allocated funds for EIS.[26]\n\nRTI was included in the regulations due to considerable concerns raised by\nboth the House and Senate Committees regarding proponents of RTI claims about\nthe use of IQ tests to identify learning disabled students. There was also\nrecognition in these committees of a growing body of scientific research\nsupporting methods of pre-referral interventions that resolved learning\ndifficulties short of classification. However, the final regulations also\nallow a third method of SLD identification, often considered a processing\nstrengths and weaknesses model.\n\nThe IDEA Committee Conference Report (CCR)[27] discusses the use of\nscientifically based early intervention programs, describes a model response-\nto-intervention program, and recommends the development of the most effective\nimplementation of responsiveness to intervention models. The report describes\nsuch a model as an essential service for reducing the need to label children\nas disabled.\n\n### Evaluating SLD using\nRTI[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Evaluating SLD using RTI\")]\n\nFirst, it should be noted that whatever procedures are used to evaluate\nstudents as eligible for special education in the category of specific\nlearning disabilities (SLD) must conform to the requirements of the IDEA\nregulations (2006), which indicate that a full and individual evaluation of a\nstudent suspected as having an SLD must address four qualifications. First,\nthe evaluation must document that \"...the child does not achieve adequately\nfor the child's age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards in one or\nmore of the following areas, when provided with learning experiences and\ninstruction appropriate for the child's age or state-approved grade-level\nstandards: oral expression, listening comprehension, written expression, basic\nreading skill, reading fluency skills, reading comprehension, mathematics\ncalculation, mathematics problem-solving\" (§300.309[a][1]). Second, the\nevaluation must document that \"...(t)he child does not make sufficient\nprogress to meet age or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of\nthe areas identified ...when using a process based on the child's response to\nscientific, research-based intervention; or (t)he child exhibits a pattern of\nstrengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to\nage, State-approved grade-level standards, or intellectual development, that\nis determined by the group to be relevant to the identification of a specific\nlearning disability, using appropriate assessments (§300.309[a][2). Third, the\nevaluation must establish that the child's academic deficiencies are not the\nresults of \"...visual, hearing, or motor disabilities; mental retardation;\nemotional disturbance; cultural factors; environmental or economic\ndisadvantage; or Limited English proficiency\" (§300.309[a][3]) or of a lack of\ninstruction ((§300.309[a][4]). Notably, a child must demonstrate\nqualifications under all four of these criteria to be identified with an SLD.\n\nKovaleski, VanDerHeyden and Shapiro (2013)[28] used these IDEA regulations to\noperationalize how evaluation teams could utilize data collected during the\nprovision of a multi-tier system of support in the evaluation process,\nparticularly those data that inform the second SLD criterion of the child's\nfailure to make sufficient progress in response scientific, research-based\nintervention (namely, RTI). Although evaluation teams may collect additional\ndata after parents give permission for a full and individual evaluation, there\nshould be ample data collected during three tiers of core instruction and\nrobust intervention that can be analyzed to address all four of the SLD\ncriteria.\n\nIn regard to the first SLD criterion, students undergoing multiple tiers of\nsupport have typically undergone multiple assessments of their academic\nskills, including annual state tests, universal screenings of all students\nthat schools typically conduct three times per year, and academic assessments\nby specialists who deliver increasingly intense academic interventions. To\nqualify under this first criterion, the preponderance of these data should\nindicate a significant academic deficiency in at least one of the identified\nareas.\n\nWhen using RTI as a component of eligibility decision-making, the school\nentity (school district, state) establishes a policy that identifies the\noption of using RTI to address the second SLD criterion (and opts not to\nselect the option to use an assessment of the student's pattern of strengths\nand weaknesses). The determination that the student fails to make sufficient\nprogress toward age or grade standards is based on an analysis of the\nprogress-monitoring data that are collected during the provision of intensive\nintervention, typically at tiers 2 and 3 of a multi-tier system of support.\nThese data consist of the results of short assessments of key academic\nindicators that are administered as often as once or twice weekly. These data\nare graphed and rates of improvement calculated so that school teams can\ndetermine whether their interventions are working. These data are then\ncompared to the rates of improvement made by typically performing students to\ndetermine whether the interventions that are being implemented in general\neducation are sufficient to allow the student to reach grade standards. If\nnot, a need for special education is indicated, and the student meets the\nsecond qualification for SLD.\n\nThe process for ruling out other disabilities or conditions when using RTI is\nsimilar to that employed in other special education evaluations, and consists\nof procedures to ensure that sensory or intellectual disabilities or\nenvironmental disadvantage or cultural/linguistic differences are not the true\ncause of the student's assessed academic deficiencies. Establishing that the\nstudent's deficiencies are not the result of a lack of instruction, however,\nrequires that the evaluation team document that the school has sufficiently\nprovided good core instruction in the basic skills and robust interventions\nwhen students have failed to profit from typical instructional practices. The\nevaluation team must also show evidence that the school personnel conducted\nrepeated assessments of the student's academic problems and communicated the\nresults of those assessments to the student's parents. Schools that use a\nmulti-tier system of support at a high degree of fidelity can typically\nreadily rule out lack of instruction as a cause of the student's academic\nconcerns. On the other hand, in enacting this provision, Congress was\ndemonstrating a concern that students might be identified with a disability\n(SLD) when the actual cause of their academic failure was ineffective\nschooling. Identifying students with SLD in failing schools is arguably\nproblematic.\n\n## Response to\nRTI[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Response to RTI\")]\n\nCriticisms point to delays in identifying students needing special education\n(which was also a concern in a 2010 OSERS Memorandum[29]), difficulties in\naccurately determining the presence of a learning disability,[30] and the\namount of training needed by general education teachers. RTI can require\nadditional work for teachers, and a potentially significant change in\nexpectations represents a great source of resistance toward RTI.[31]\n\nAnother criticism of RTI is that while its core assumptions include \"that the\neducational system can effectively teach all children,\" interpretations of the\napproach often do not account for gifted education. An inverted pyramid\nshowing analogous increasing interventions for gifted children could be added\nto the model so that all children are addressed. A framework for such an\napproach has been developed by the Montana Office of Public Instruction.[32]\n\n## Concerns and criticisms of RTI for SLD\nclassification[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Concerns and criticisms of RTI for SLD classification\")]\n\nCriticisms of the RTI model first surfaced in 2004 when IDEA identified it as\na viable method for use in SLD eligibility determination[33] Some feel that\nRTI is valuable for prevention, but see little empirical support for using RTI\nto determine learning disabilities, and have concern that it could be used to\ndelay or deny services to children with learning disabilities.[34] Some also\nargue that there are many unanswered questions about RTI implementation, and\nthat proponents have tended to gloss over or ignore criticisms of the RTI\napproach.[35] Several major research efforts have supported these contentions\nthrough findings suggesting that RTI does not produce reliable sets of\nresponders and non-responders.[36][37][38] If RTI does not produce reliable\nsets of responders/nonresponders, it would be difficult to use this approach\nto determine learning disabilities.[39]\n\n## Technology application to\nRTI[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Technology application to RTI\")]\n\nTechnology is becoming increasingly important in improving instructional\npractices and student achievement. Tools that educators can utilize within\ntheir classrooms include [weblogs](/wiki/Weblog \"Weblog\"), [wikis](/wiki/Wiki\n\"Wiki\"), [RSS](/wiki/RSS \"RSS\") [aggregators](/wiki/News_aggregator \"News\naggregator\"), [social bookmarking](/wiki/Social_bookmarking \"Social\nbookmarking\"), online photo galleries, [audio/visual casting](/wiki/Webcasting\n\"Webcasting\"), [Twitter](/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\"), and [social\nnetworking](/wiki/Social_networking \"Social networking\") sites.[40] Many of\nthese tools can be used for team-based learning and in facilitating students'\nuse of higher forms of thinking such as analysis, evaluation, and\nsynthesis.[40]\n\nProperly integrated technology can increase student learning in areas such as\nmotivation, collaborative learning, critical thinking, and problem\nsolving.[41] Some techniques that have been found to work in education\ninclude: identifying similarities and differences; summarizing and note\ntaking; reinforcing effort and providing recognition; assigning homework and\npractice; utilizing graphic representations of concepts; cooperative learning;\nproviding objectives and feedback; generating and testing hypotheses;\nproviding cues and questions; and using advanced organizers.[42] Technology-\nrich environments can also be effective for at-risk students, and can motivate\nstudents to stay in school and hopefully lessen the achievement gap.[43]\n\nComputer Assisted Instruction (CAI), has been studied for its effects on lower\nachieving students. The effectiveness has been attributed to it being non-\njudgmental and motivational, while giving immediate and frequent feedback,\nindividualizing learning to meet the students' needs, allowing for more\nstudent autonomy, and providing multi-sensory components (Barley _et al._ ,\n2002, p. 97).[44] A review of 17 different studies found that CAI positively\naffected scores in mathematics and literacy for all grade levels and\nsignificantly improving scores for students labeled \"at-risk\" (Barley _et al._\n, 2002, p. 105).[44]\n\nTechnology can also effectively help teach basic literacy skills such as\nphonemic awareness, alphabetic principle, word recognition, alliteration, and\ncomprehension. Today the use of specialized educational software applications\ncan help support and enhance students' literacy skills. Presentation software\nsuch as [PowerPoint](/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint \"Microsoft PowerPoint\") can be\nused to enhance young children learning experience. The use of pictures,\ncolors, sounds, animation, slide designs, or slide transitions can be easily\nimplemented into a literacy lesson, and such software has been used, for\nexample, to help students with autism learn and respond to activity\nschedules.[45]\n\nFor young learners, the use of animation directs their attention to important\nfeatures and prompts them to help ensure correct responses. Teachers can\ncreate literacy lessons with attention-grabbing elements such as moving\ngraphic images. For example, a teacher might focus on the initial /d/ sound in\nthe word \"dog\" as an instructional goal; a presentation slide for this would\nshow a picture of a dog, and the teacher would select three possible letters\nto represent the initial sound in dog, such as /b/, /c/, and /d/. After\nshowing the picture of the dog, and then displaying each of the three letter\nchoices one-by-one, the teacher would ask the student what letter he or she\nthinks \"dog\" starts with.[46] Other types of presentation software for\nliteracy instruction, such as [Photo Story](/wiki/Photo_Story \"Photo Story\"),\ncan allow teachers to add a variety of special effects, soundtracks, captions,\nand their own voice narration to the photo stories.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Minimally invasive education](/wiki/Minimally_invasive_education \"Minimally invasive education\")\n  * [Positive education](/wiki/Positive_education \"Positive education\")\n  * [Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports](/wiki/Positive_Behavior_Interventions_and_Supports \"Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports\")\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Response_to_intervention&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Ysseldyke, J., Thurlow, M., Graden, J., Wesson, C., Algozzine, B., & Deno, S.
