The song was originally supposed to precede the\nalbum's UK release on August 31, 2009 and U.S. release on September 1, 2009\nbut was cancelled in favor of \"[I Look to You](/wiki/I_Look_to_You_\\(song\\) \"I\nLook to You \\(song\\)\")\" and \"[Million Dollar Bill](/wiki/Million_Dollar_Bill\n\"Million Dollar Bill\")\".[1][2] However, the song was released on November 6,\n2009 as a [promotional single](/wiki/Promotional_single \"Promotional single\").\n\nA live performance was included in the 2014 CD/DVD release, _[Whitney Houston\nLive: Her Greatest\nPerformances](/wiki/Whitney_Houston_Live:_Her_Greatest_Performances \"Whitney\nHouston Live: Her Greatest Performances\")_.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Critical reception\n  * 2 Background\n  * 3 Track listing\n  * 4 Charts\n  * 5 References\n\n## Critical\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Didn%27t_Know_My_Own_Strength_\\(Whitney_Houston_song\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Critical reception\")]\n\nWhen reviewing the album _[Digital Spy](/wiki/Digital_Spy \"Digital Spy\")_\ndescribed the song along with the title track \"the album's pair of classic\nWhitney ballads.\"[4]\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Didn%27t_Know_My_Own_Strength_\\(Whitney_Houston_song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nThough never officially released, UK columnist Lizzie Smith reported in the\n_[Daily Mail](/wiki/Daily_Mail \"Daily Mail\")_ the song had been leaked to the\ninternet prior to its official release date.[5] However, music mogul [Clive\nDavis](/wiki/Clive_Davis \"Clive Davis\") said at the album's official launch\nparty in [London](/wiki/London \"London\") that all of the tracks on the album\nremain unfinished.[6][7][8][9] The song's release was originally confirmed by\nDiane Warren who told _[Vibe Magazine](/wiki/Vibe_Magazine \"Vibe Magazine\")_\nshe had penned the single especially for Houston, and it would be released as\nthe first single.[10] At the album listening parties, Davis said the album\ntrack \"Call You Tonight\" was a candidate for the lead single. Following\nprevious reports, this led to speculation that \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\"\nwould receive a limited release to generate buzz for the album, whilst a\ndifferent song will be fully promoted and released to propel the album's\nrelease. Title song \"[I Look to You](/wiki/I_Look_to_You_\\(song\\) \"I Look to\nYou \\(song\\)\")\" was released as the U.S. lead single whilst \"[Million Dollar\nBill](/wiki/Million_Dollar_Bill \"Million Dollar Bill\")\" (the second U.S.\nrelease) became the international lead single. Houston performed the song on\n[The Oprah Winfrey Show](/wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show \"The Oprah Winfrey\nShow\") on September 15, 2009[11][12] and live on the 2009 American Music\nAwards broadcast.\n\n## Track\nlisting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Didn%27t_Know_My_Own_Strength_\\(Whitney_Houston_song\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Track listing\")]\n\nDue to the popularity of the song a remix-EP was released alongside remixes\nfor the two official singles on November 6, 2009.[13]\n\n  1. \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\" ([Peter Rauhofer](/wiki/Peter_Rauhofer \"Peter Rauhofer\") Radio Edit) – 3:04\n  2. \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\" (Peter Rauhofer Mixshow) – 5:15\n  3. \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\" (Daddy's Groove Magic Island Radio Mix) – 3:11\n  4. \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\" (Daddy's Groove Magic Island Mixshow) – 5:19\n  5. \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\" (Daddy's Groove Magic Island Club Mix) – 7:23\n\n##\nCharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Didn%27t_Know_My_Own_Strength_\\(Whitney_Houston_song\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Charts\")]\n\nChart (2009)  | Peak   \nposition  \n---|---  \nIreland ([IRMA](/wiki/Irish_Singles_Chart \"Irish Singles Chart\"))[14] | 38   \nJapan ([Japan Hot 100](/wiki/Japan_Hot_100 \"Japan Hot 100\"))[15] | 16   \n[UK Singles](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\") (Official Charts Company)[16] | 44   \nUS [Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs](/wiki/Hot_R%26B/Hip-Hop_Songs \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs\") (_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_)[17] | 66   \nUS [Dance Club Songs](/wiki/Dance_Club_Songs \"Dance Club Songs\") (_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_)[18] | 17   \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Didn%27t_Know_My_Own_Strength_\\(Whitney_Houston_song\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Whitney Officially Confirms Release](http://whitneyhouston.com/)\n  2. **Jump up ^** [Pre-album launch party](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268081/whitney-houston-premieres-new-album-in-london)\n  3. **Jump up ^** <http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-her-greatest-performances-mw0002759110>\n  4. **Jump up ^** [\"Whitney Houston: 'I Look To You' \\- Music Album Review\"](http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/albumreviews/a174768/whitney-houston-i-look-to-you.html).
