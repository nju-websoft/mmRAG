The most\n\"extreme\" tornado in [recorded history](/wiki/Recorded_history \"Recorded\nhistory\") was the [Tri-State Tornado](/wiki/Tri-State_Tornado \"Tri-State\nTornado\"), which spread through parts of [Missouri](/wiki/Missouri\n\"Missouri\"), [Illinois](/wiki/Illinois \"Illinois\"), and\n[Indiana](/wiki/Indiana \"Indiana\") on March 18, 1925. It is considered an F5,\nthough tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records\nfor longest path length at 219 miles (352 km), longest duration at about 3½\nhours, and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado at 73 mph (117\nkm/h) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in\nUnited States history with 695 fatalities.[1] It was also the third-costliest\ntornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-\nnormalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks\nthird today.[2]\n\nThe deadliest tornado in world history was the [Daulatpur–Saturia\ntornado](/wiki/Daulatpur%E2%80%93Saturia_tornado \"Daulatpur–Saturia tornado\")\nin [Bangladesh](/wiki/Bangladesh \"Bangladesh\") on April 26, 1989, which killed\napproximately 1,300 people.[3] In its history Bangladesh has had at least 19\ntornadoes kill more than 100 people, almost half of the [total for the rest of\nthe world](/wiki/List_of_tornadoes_causing_100_or_more_deaths \"List of\ntornadoes causing 100 or more deaths\").\n\nFor 37 years, the most extensive [tornado outbreak](/wiki/Tornado_outbreak\n\"Tornado outbreak\") on record, in almost every category, was the [1974 Super\nOutbreak](/wiki/1974_Super_Outbreak \"1974 Super Outbreak\"), which affected a\nlarge area of the central United States and extreme southern\n[Ontario](/wiki/Ontario \"Ontario\") in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not\nonly did this outbreak feature 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an\nunprecedented number of them were violent; 7 were of F5 intensity and 23 were\nF4. During the peak of this outbreak there were 16 tornadoes on the ground at\nthe same time. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by\ntornadoes during this outbreak. However, this record was later broken during\nthe [2011 Super Outbreak](/wiki/2011_Super_Outbreak \"2011 Super Outbreak\"),\nwhich resulted in 362 tornadoes and 324 tornadic fatalities.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Tornado outbreaks\n    * 1.1 Most tornadoes in single 24-hour period\n    * 1.2 Longest continuous outbreak and largest autumnal outbreak\n    * 1.3 Greatest number of tornadoes spawned from a hurricane\n  * 2 Tornado casualties and damage\n    * 2.1 Deadliest single tornado in world history\n    * 2.2 Deadliest single tornado in US history\n    * 2.3 Most damaging tornado\n  * 3 Largest and most powerful tornadoes\n    * 3.1 Highest winds observed in a tornado\n    * 3.2 Longest damage path and duration\n    * 3.3 Longest path and duration tornado family\n    * 3.4 Largest path width\n    * 3.5 Highest forward speed\n    * 3.6 Greatest pressure drop\n  * 4 Early tornadoes\n    * 4.1 Earliest-known tornado in Europe\n    * 4.2 Earliest-known tornado in the Americas\n    * 4.3 First confirmed tornado and first tornado fatality in present-day United States\n  * 5 Exceptional tornado droughts\n    * 5.1 Longest span without a tornado rated F5 or EF5\n  * 6 Exceptional survivors\n    * 6.1 Longest distance carried by a tornado\n  * 7 Exceptional coincidences\n    * 7.1 Codell, Kansas\n    * 7.2 Tanner/Harvest, Alabama\n    * 7.3 Moore, Oklahoma\n    * 7.4 Jackson, Tennessee\n    * 7.5 Grand Island, Nebraska\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Tornado\noutbreaks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Tornado outbreaks\")]\n\n### Most tornadoes in single 24-hour\nperiod[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Most tornadoes in single 24-hour period\")]\n\nThe [2011 Super Outbreak](/wiki/2011_Super_Outbreak \"2011 Super Outbreak\") was\nthe most prolific tornado outbreak in USA history. It produced 362 tornadoes,\nwith 218 of those in a single 24-hour period on April 27,[5] including 11 EF4\nand 4 EF5 tornadoes. 348 deaths occurred in that outbreak, of which 324 were\ntornado related. The outbreak helped smash the record for most tornadoes in\nthe month of April with 772 tornadoes, almost triple the prior record (267 in\nApril 1974). The overall record for a single month was 542 in May 2003, which\nwas also broken.[6]\n\nThe infamous [1974 Super Outbreak](/wiki/1974_Super_Outbreak \"1974 Super\nOutbreak\") of April 3–4, 1974, which spawned 148 confirmed tornadoes across\neastern North America, held the record for the most prolific tornado outbreak\nfor many years. Not only did it produce an exceptional number of tornadoes,\nbut it was also an inordinately intense outbreak producing dozens of large,\nlong-track tornadoes, including 7 F5 and 23 F4 tornadoes. More significant\ntornadoes occurred within 24 hours than any other week in the tornado\nrecord.[7] Due to a secular trend in tornado reporting, the 2011 and 1974\ntornado counts are not directly comparable.\n\n### Longest continuous outbreak and largest autumnal\noutbreak[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Longest continuous outbreak and largest autumnal outbreak\")]\n\nMost tornado outbreaks in North America occur in the spring, but there is a\nsecondary peak of tornado activity in the fall which is less consistent but\ncan include exceptionally large and/or intense outbreaks. In 1992, an\nestimated [95 tornadoes](/wiki/November_1992_tornado_outbreak \"November 1992\ntornado outbreak\") broke out in a record 41 hours of continuous [tornado\nactivity](/wiki/November_1992_tornado_outbreak \"November 1992 tornado\noutbreak\") from November 21 to 23. This is also among the largest-known\noutbreaks in areal expanse. Many other very large outbreaks have occurred in\nautumn, especially in October and November.[1]\n\n### Greatest number of tornadoes spawned from a\nhurricane[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Greatest number of tornadoes spawned from a hurricane\")]\n\nThe greatest number of tornadoes spawned from a hurricane is 118 from\n[Hurricane Ivan](/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan_tornado_outbreak \"Hurricane Ivan tornado\noutbreak\") in 2004.[8] Caution is advised comparing the raw number of counted\ntornadoes from recent decades to decades prior to the 1990s since more\ntornadoes that occur are now recorded than in the past.\n\n## Tornado casualties

(11),\n[Illinois](/wiki/Illinois \"Illinois\") (613), and [Indiana](/wiki/Indiana\n\"Indiana\") (71). The outbreak it occurred with was also the deadliest known\n[tornado outbreak](/wiki/Tornado_outbreak \"Tornado outbreak\"), with a combined\ndeath toll of 747 across the Mississippi River Valley.[1][10][11]\n\n### Most damaging\ntornado[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Most damaging tornado\")]\n\nSimilar to fatalities, damage (and observations) of a tornado are a\ncoincidence of what character of tornado interacts with certain\ncharacteristics of built up areas. That is, destructive tornadoes are in a\nsense \"accidents\" of a large tornado striking a large population. In addition\nto population and changes thereof, comparing damage historically is subject to\nchanges in wealth and inflation. The [1896 St. Louis–East St. Louis\ntornado](/wiki/1896_St._Louis%E2%80%93East_St._Louis_tornado \"1896 St.\nLouis–East St. Louis tornado\") on May 27, incurred the most damages adjusted\nfor wealth and inflation, at an estimated $2.9 billion (1997 USD). In raw\nnumbers, the [Joplin tornado](/wiki/2011_Joplin_tornado \"2011 Joplin tornado\")\nof May 22, 2011 is considered the costliest tornado in recent history, with\ndamage totals near $2.8 billion (2011 USD). Until 2011, the \"[Bridge Creek-\nMoore tornado](/wiki/1999_Bridge_Creek-Moore_tornado \"1999 Bridge Creek-Moore\ntornado\")\" of May 3, 1999 was the most damaging.[12]\n\n## Largest and most powerful\ntornadoes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Largest and most powerful tornadoes\")]\n\n### Highest winds observed in a\ntornado[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Highest winds observed in a tornado\")]\n\nDuring the F5 [1999 Bridge Creek–Moore\ntornado](/wiki/1999_Bridge_Creek%E2%80%93Moore_tornado \"1999 Bridge\nCreek–Moore tornado\") on May 3, 1999 in the southern [Oklahoma City\nmetro](/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Metropolitan_Area \"Oklahoma City Metropolitan\nArea\") area, a [Doppler on Wheels](/wiki/Doppler_on_Wheels \"Doppler on\nWheels\") situated near the tornado measured winds of 302 ± 20 mph (486 ± 32\nkm/h) momentarily in a small area inside the funnel approximately 100 m (330\nft) above ground level.[13] These are also the highest wind speeds observed on\nEarth.\n\nOn May 31, 2013, a tornado hit rural areas near [El Reno,\nOklahoma](/wiki/El_Reno,_Oklahoma \"El Reno, Oklahoma\"). The tornado was\noriginally rated as an EF3 based on damage; however, after mobile radar data\nanalysis was conducted, it was concluded to have been an EF5 due to a measured\nwind speed of greater than 296 mph (476 km/h), second only to the Bridge Creek\n- Moore tornado. Revised RaXPol analysis found winds of 302 mph (486 km/h)\nwell above ground level and ≥291 mph (468 km/h) below 10 m (33 ft) with some\nsubvortices moving at 175 mph (282 km/h).[14] These winds may possibly be as\nhigh or higher than the winds recorded on May 3, 1999. Despite the recorded\nwindspeed, the El Reno tornado was later downgraded back to EF3 due to the\nfact that no EF5 damage was found, likely due to the lack of sufficient damage\nindicators in the largely rural area west of [Oklahoma\nCity](/wiki/Oklahoma_City \"Oklahoma City\").[15][16]\n\nWinds were measured at 257–268 mph (414–431 km/h) using portable Doppler radar\nin the [Red Rock, Oklahoma](/wiki/Red_Rock,_Oklahoma \"Red Rock, Oklahoma\")\ntornado during the [April 26, 1991 tornado\noutbreak](/wiki/April_26,_1991_tornado_outbreak \"April 26, 1991 tornado\noutbreak\") in north-central Oklahoma. Though these winds are possibly\nindicative of an F5 strength tornado, this particular tornado's path never\nencountered any significant structures and caused minimal damage. Thus it was\nrated an F4.[17]\n\n### Longest damage path and\nduration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Longest damage path and duration\")]\n\nThe longest-known track for a single tornado is the [Tri-State\nTornado](/wiki/Tri-State_Tornado \"Tri-State Tornado\") with a path length of\n151 to 235 mi (243 to 378 km). For years there was debate whether the\noriginally recognized path length of 219 mi (352 km) over 3.5 hours was from\none tornado or a series. Some very long track (VLT) tornadoes were later\ndetermined to be successive tornadoes spawned by the same supercell\nthunderstorm, which are known as a [tornado family](/wiki/Tornado_family\n\"Tornado family\"). The Tri-State Tornado, however, appeared to have no gaps in\nthe damage. A six-year reanalysis study by a team of severe convective storm\nmeteorologists found insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions but does\nconclude that it is likely that the beginning and ending of the path was\nresultant of separate tornadoes comprising a tornado family. It also found\nthat the tornado began 15 mi (24 km) to the west and ended 1 mi (1.6 km)\nfarther east than previously known, bringing the total path to 235 mi (378\nkm). The 174 mi (280 km) segment from central [Madison County,\nMissouri](/wiki/Madison_County,_Missouri \"Madison County, Missouri\") to [Pike\nCounty, Indiana](/wiki/Pike_County,_Indiana \"Pike County, Indiana\") is likely\none continuous tornado and the 151 mi (243 km) segment from central [Bollinger\nCounty, Missouri](/wiki/Bollinger_County,_Missouri \"Bollinger County,\nMissouri\") to western Pike County, Indiana is very likely a single continuous\ntornado. Another [significant](/wiki/Glossary_of_tornado_terms#S \"Glossary of\ntornado terms\") tornado was found about 65 mi (105 km) east-northeast of the\nend of aforementioned segment(s) of the Tri-State Tornado Family and is likely\nanother member of the family. Its path length of 20 mi (32 km) over about 20\nminutes makes the known tornado family path length total to 320 mi (510 km)\nover about 5½ hours.[18] [Grazulis](/wiki/Thomas_P._Grazulis \"Thomas P.\nGrazulis\") in 2001 wrote that the first 60 mi (97 km) of the (originally\nrecognized) track is probably the result of two or more tornadoes and that a\npath length of 157 mi (253 km) was seemingly continuous.[19]\n\n### Longest path and duration tornado\nfamily[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Longest path and duration tornado family\")]\n\nWhat at one time was thought to be the record holder for the longest tornado\npath is now thought to be the longest tornado family, with a track of at least\n293 miles (472 km) on May 26, 1917 from the Missouri border across Illinois\ninto Indiana. It caused severe damage and mass casualties in\n[Charleston](/wiki/Charleston,_Illinois \"Charleston, Illinois\") and [Mattoon,\nIllinois](/wiki/Mattoon,_Illinois \"Mattoon, Illinois\").[1]\n\nWhat was probably the longest track [supercell](/wiki/Supercell \"Supercell\")\nthunderstorm tracked 790 miles (1,270 km) across 6 states in 17.5 hours on\nMarch 12, 2006 as part of the [March 2006 tornado outbreak\nsequence](/wiki/March_2006_tornado_outbreak_sequence \"March 2006 tornado\noutbreak sequence\"). It began in [Noble County,\nOklahoma](/wiki/Noble_County,_Oklahoma \"Noble County, Oklahoma\") and ended in\n[Jackson County, Michigan](/wiki/Jackson_County,_Michigan \"Jackson County,\nMichigan\"), producing many tornadoes in Missouri and Illinois.[20]\n\n### Largest path\nwidth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Largest path width\")]\n\nOfficially, the widest tornado on record is the [El Reno,\nOklahoma](/wiki/El_Reno,_Oklahoma \"El Reno, Oklahoma\")\n[tornado](/wiki/2013_El_Reno_tornado \"2013 El Reno tornado\") of May 31, 2013\nwith a width of 2.6 miles (4.2 km) at its peak. This is the width found by the\nNational Weather Service based on preliminary data from University of Oklahoma\nRaxPol mobile radar that also sampled winds of 296 mph (476 km/h) which was\nused to upgrade the tornado to EF5.[21] However, it was revealed that these\nwinds did not impact any structures, and as a result the tornado was\ndowngraded to EF3 based on damage.[22] However, another possible contender for\nthe widest tornado as measured by radar was the F4\n[Mulhall](/wiki/Mulhall,_Oklahoma \"Mulhall, Oklahoma\") tornado in north-\ncentral Oklahoma which occurred during the [1999 Oklahoma tornado\noutbreak](/wiki/1999_Oklahoma_tornado_outbreak \"1999 Oklahoma tornado\noutbreak\"). The [diameter of the maximum winds](/wiki/Radius_of_maximum_wind\n\"Radius of maximum wind\") (over 110 mph (49 m/s)) was over 5,200 feet (1,600\nm) as measured by a DOW radar. Although the tornado passed largely over rural\nterrain, the width of the wind swath capable of producing damage was as wide\nas 4 mi (6.4 km).[23][24]\n\nThe F4 [Hallam, Nebraska](/wiki/Hallam,_Nebraska \"Hallam, Nebraska\")\n[tornado](/wiki/2004_Hallam,_Nebraska_tornado \"2004 Hallam, Nebraska tornado\")\nduring the [outbreak](/wiki/May_2004_tornado_outbreak_sequence \"May 2004\ntornado outbreak sequence\") of May 22, 2004 was the previous official record\nholder for the widest tornado, surveyed at 2.5 miles (4.0 km) wide. A similar\nsize tornado struck [Edmonson, Texas](/wiki/Edmonson,_Texas \"Edmonson, Texas\")\non May 31, 1968, when a damage path width between 2 to 3 miles (3.2 to 4.8 km)\nwas recorded from an F3 tornado.[25]\n\n### Highest forward\nspeed[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Highest forward speed\")]\n\nSeventy-three miles per hour (117 km/h) from the Tri-State Tornado (other weak\ntornadoes have approached or exceeded this speed, but this is the fastest\nforward movement observed in a major tornado).[1]\n\n### Greatest pressure\ndrop[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Greatest pressure drop\")]\n\nA [pressure](/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure \"Atmospheric pressure\") deficit of 100\nmillibars (2.95 inHg) was observed when a violent\n[tornado](/wiki/2003_South_Dakota_tornado_outbreak \"2003 South Dakota tornado\noutbreak\") near [Manchester, South Dakota](/wiki/Manchester,_South_Dakota\n\"Manchester, South Dakota\") on June 24, 2003 passed directly over an [in-\nsitu](/wiki/In-situ \"In-situ\") probe that storm chasing researcher [Tim\nSamaras](/wiki/Tim_Samaras \"Tim Samaras\") deployed.[26] In less than a minute,\nthe pressure dropped to 850 millibars (25.10 inHg), which are the greatest\npressure decline and the lowest pressure ever recorded at the Earth's surface\nwhen adjusted to sea level.[27][28]\n\nOn April 21, 2007, a 194-millibar (5.73 inHg) pressure deficit was reported\nwhen a [tornado](/wiki/List_of_late-\nApril_2007_tornado_outbreak_sequence_tornadoes \"List of late-April 2007\ntornado outbreak sequence tornadoes\") struck a [storm\nchasing](/wiki/Storm_chasing \"Storm chasing\") vehicle in [Tulia,\nTexas](/wiki/Tulia,_Texas \"Tulia, Texas\").[29] The tornado caused EF2 damage\nas it passed through Tulia.

The suburban community of [Harvest,\nAlabama](/wiki/Harvest,_Alabama \"Harvest, Alabama\"), just to the northeast,\nalso sustained major impacts from all three Tanner tornadoes, and was also hit\nby destructive tornadoes in [1995](/wiki/1995_Anderson_Hills_tornado \"1995\nAnderson Hills tornado\") and\n[2012](/wiki/March_2%E2%80%933,_2012_tornado_outbreak \"March 2–3, 2012 tornado\noutbreak\").\n\n### Moore,\nOklahoma[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Moore, Oklahoma\")]\n\nThe south [Oklahoma City](/wiki/Oklahoma_City \"Oklahoma City\") suburb of\n[Moore, Oklahoma](/wiki/Moore,_Oklahoma \"Moore, Oklahoma\") was hit by\ntornadoes in 1973, [1999](/wiki/1999_Bridge_Creek_%E2%80%93_Moore_tornado\n\"1999 Bridge Creek – Moore tornado\"),\n[2003](/wiki/May_2003_tornado_outbreak_sequence#Moore_Tornado_\\(F4\\) \"May 2003\ntornado outbreak sequence\"), [2010](/wiki/Early-\nMay_2010_tornado_outbreak#Moore_–_Choctaw_tornado \"Early-May 2010 tornado\noutbreak\"), [2013](/wiki/2013_Moore_tornado \"2013 Moore tornado\"), and 2015,\nfive of which were of F4/EF4 strength or greater, although it was determined\nthat the tornado in 2003 caused no F4 damage within Moore itself, but in areas\nto its northeast. The 1999 and 2013 events were rated F5 and EF5,\nrespectively. In total, about 23 tornadoes have struck within the immediate\nvicinity of Moore since 1890, the most recent of which was an EF2 on March 25,\n2015.[41]\n\n### Jackson,\nTennessee[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tornado_records&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Jackson, Tennessee\")]\n\nThe city of [Jackson, Tennessee](/wiki/Jackson,_Tennessee \"Jackson,\nTennessee\") has been hit by an F4/EF4 tornado three separate times, in\n[1999](/wiki/January_17%E2%80%9318,_1999_tornado_outbreak \"January 17–18, 1999\ntornado outbreak\"), [2003](/wiki/May_2003_tornado_outbreak_sequence \"May 2003\ntornado outbreak sequence\"), and\n[2008](/wiki/2008_Super_Tuesday_tornado_outbreak \"2008 Super Tuesday tornado\noutbreak\").
