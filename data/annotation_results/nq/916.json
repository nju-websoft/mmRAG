You need to go some kind of populist\nroute. So, about three years ago, I sat down with a Westlife song and tried to\nwrite something similar.\"[4]\n\nBedingfield also admitted that he didn't even want to put the song on his\nalbum.[5] He said, \"I didn't want to put \"If You're Not the One\" on the album\nas I thought it was too cheesy. I thought it sounded like Westlife. But she\n([Natasha Bedingfield](/wiki/Natasha_Bedingfield \"Natasha Bedingfield\"), his\nsister) loved it. Women that hear it go all soft and think it's lovely\"[5]\n\n##\nComposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=If_You%27re_Not_the_One&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\n\"If You're Not the One\" plays for 4 minutes and 19 seconds, in [common\ntime](/wiki/Common_time \"Common time\"). It is in the key of [B-flat\nmajor](/wiki/B-flat_major \"B-flat major\"), and the chorus features Bedingfield\nsinging [falsetto](/wiki/Falsetto \"Falsetto\"), where he hits the note\n[E♭5](/wiki/E%E2%99%AD_\\(musical_note\\) \"E♭ \\(musical note\\)\").[6]\n\n## Critical\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=If_You%27re_Not_the_One&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Critical reception\")]\n\n\"If You're Not the One\" received mixed reviews from contemporary music\ncritics. On the positive side, Peter Robinson, in the _Gotta Get thru This_\nalbum review for the _[New Musical Express](/wiki/NME \"NME\")_ (_NME_), wrote\n\"If You're Not the One [recalls] every chart-mauling uber-ballad you've ever\nheard\".[7] Nedd Raggett of [AllMusic](/wiki/AllMusic \"AllMusic\") commented in\nhis album review \"When it comes to ballads, they work best in sudden moments –\nthe soaring end to If You're Not the One\".[8] [About.com](/wiki/About.com\n\"About.com\") ranked the song at number 27 on its list of the 'Top 100 Pop\nSongs of 2002', two places behind the [album's title\ntrack](/wiki/Gotta_Get_Thru_This_\\(song\\) \"Gotta Get Thru This \\(song\\)\").[9]\nThe song was again ranked at number 27 on the 2003 list, due to it being\nreleased in the United States during that year.[10] _Music Week_ felt that the\nsong showed Bedingfield's \"sensitive side\", and that the song \"showcases his\nvocal range to stunning effect.\"[2] The magazine even considered it\n\"beautifully crafted.\"[2]\n\nHowever, the track also received some negative feedback.\n_[PopMatters](/wiki/PopMatters \"PopMatters\")_ ' Nikki Tranter wrote \"surely\nyou would think with his obviously overwhelming ability to compose utter\nclaptrap cleverly disguised as serious prophesizing, his lyrics might contain\nsomething a little more expressive than 'If you're not the one / Why does my\nheart feel glad today / If you're not the one / Then why does my hand fit\nyours this way.'\"[11] In his review for [musicOMH](/wiki/MusicOMH \"MusicOMH\"),\nMichael Hubbard was even less positive, stating, \"If You're Not the One is as\nvomit-inducing as anything the man in the plastic mask has ever wretched\n_([sic](/wiki/Sic \"Sic\"))_ forth at the world\".[12]\n\n## Chart\nperformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=If_You%27re_Not_the_One&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Chart performance\")]\n\nWhen the song was released as a single, it was picked up by radio stations. It\nwas the most added pop song on the radio for the week of 20 February 2003.[13]\nIn the US, the song was the most added song in the Adult Contemporary market\nfor the week of 7 April 2003.[14] In the US, the song was his highest debuting\nsingle, debuting at number 55 on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\").[14] The single proved to be\na successful release for Bedingfield, providing him with several worldwide\nnumber ones and reaching the top 20 in all but one of the charts that it\nappeared on. It debuted at number one in the [UK Singles\nChart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\"), knocking [Christina\nAguilera](/wiki/Christina_Aguilera \"Christina Aguilera\")'s\n\"[Dirrty](/wiki/Dirrty \"Dirrty\")\" from the top spot.[15]\n\n## Music\nvideo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=If_You%27re_Not_the_One&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Music video\")]\n\nThe music video was produced by [A1](/wiki/A1_\\(band\\) \"A1 \\(band\\)\") singer\n[Mark Read](/wiki/Mark_Read_\\(singer\\) \"Mark Read \\(singer\\)\"). It begins with\na series of images of Bedingfield singing in various positions against a black\nbackdrop. When the chorus starts he is seen singing with clouds in the\nbackground. The initial sequence is repeated for the second verse. However,\nhalf-way through, he starts to write on a wall. The rest of the song follows\nthe same pattern.\n\n## Track\nlistings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=If_You%27re_Not_the_One&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Track listings\")]\n\nUK CD1[16]\n\n  1.
