Although silent,\nher role is important. [Romeo](/wiki/Romeo_Montague \"Romeo Montague\") is at\nfirst deeply in love with Rosaline and expresses his dismay at her not loving\nhim back. Romeo first spots [Juliet](/wiki/Juliet_Capulet \"Juliet Capulet\")\nwhile trying to catch a glimpse of Rosaline at a gathering hosted by the\nCapulet family.\n\nScholars generally compare Romeo's short-lived love of Rosaline with his later\nlove of Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for Rosaline is much weaker than\nthat for Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with Rosaline\nprepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of _Romeo\nand Juliet_ have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's\nrelationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making Rosaline a more\nvisible character.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Role in the play\n  * 2 Analysis\n    * 2.1 Name\n    * 2.2 Rosaline as plot device\n    * 2.3 Rosaline and Juliet\n  * 3 Performances\n  * 4 References\n\n## Role in the play[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rosaline&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Role in the play\")]\n\nBefore [Romeo](/wiki/Romeo_Montague \"Romeo Montague\") meets\n[Juliet](/wiki/Juliet_Capulet \"Juliet Capulet\"), he loves Rosaline, Capulet's\nniece and Juliet's cousin. He describes her as wonderfully beautiful: \"The\nall-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.\"[1]\nRosaline, however, chooses to remain [chaste](/wiki/Chastity \"Chastity\");\nRomeo says: \"She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow / Do I live dead that\nlive to tell it now.\"[2] This is the source of his depression, and he makes\nhis friends unhappy; [Mercutio](/wiki/Mercutio \"Mercutio\") comments: \"That\nsame pale, hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so that he will\nsure run mad.\"[3] [Benvolio](/wiki/Benvolio \"Benvolio\") urges Romeo to sneak\ninto a Capulet gathering where, he claims, Rosaline will look like \"a crow\"\nalongside the other beautiful women.[4] Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's\nassessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: \"Did my\nheart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till\nthis night.\"[5] Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's\nfriends and [Friar Laurence](/wiki/Friar_Laurence \"Friar Laurence\") continue\nto speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play.\n\n## Analysis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rosaline&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Analysis\")]\n\n### Name[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rosaline&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Name\")]\n\n\"...Juliet on the balcony ponders Romeo's name and likens it to that rose that\nremains itself whatever it is called. Is Juliet that rose, and, thereby,\nRosaline renamed?\"\"\n\n—Jonathan Goldberg[6]\n\nRosaline is a variant of Rosalind,[7] a name of [Old French](/wiki/Old_French\n\"Old French\") origin: (_hros_ = \"horse\", _lind_ = \"soft, tender\"). When it was\nimported into English it was thought to be from the Latin _rosa linda_\n(\"lovely rose\").[8] Romeo sees Rosaline as the embodiment of the rose because\nof her name and her apparent perfections.[9][10] The name Rosaline commonly\nappears in [Petrarchan sonnets](/wiki/Sonnets \"Sonnets\"), a form of poetry\nRomeo uses to woo Juliet and to describe both Rosaline and Juliet. Since\nRosaline is unattainable, she is a perfect subject for this style; but Romeo's\nattempt at it is forced and weak. By the time he meets Juliet his poetic\nability has improved considerably.[9]\n\n[Gender studies critics](/wiki/Gender_studies \"Gender studies\") have argued\nthat Rosaline's name suggests that Romeo never really forgets her but rather\nreplaces her with Juliet. Thus, when Juliet cries \"What's in a name? A rose by\nany other name would smell as sweet,\" she is ironically expressing Romeo's own\nview of her as a substitute for Rosaline. That is to say, Rosaline, replaced\nin name only by Juliet, is just as sweet to Romeo.[6] Gender critics also note\nthat the arguments used to dissuade Romeo from pursuing Rosaline are similar\nto the themes of Shakespeare's [procreation sonnets](/wiki/Procreation_sonnets\n\"Procreation sonnets\"). In these sonnets Shakespeare urges the man (who can be\nequated with Romeo) to find a woman with whom to procreate—a duty he owes to\nsociety. Rosaline, it seems, is distant and unavailable except in the mind,\nsimilarly bringing no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best\nreplaced by someone who will reciprocate. Rosaline reveals similarities to the\nsubject of the sonnets when she refuses to break her vow of chastity. Her name\nmay be referred to in the [first sonnet](/wiki/Sonnet_1 \"Sonnet 1\") when the\nyoung man is described as \"beauties Rose.\" This line ties the young man to\nboth Rosaline and Romeo in Juliet's \"What's in a name?\" soliloquy. When Juliet\nsays \"...that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as\nsweet\",[11] she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference\nbetween the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.[6]\n\nRosaline is used as a name for only one other Shakespearean character—the one\nof the main female figures in _[Love's Labours\nLost](/wiki/Love%27s_Labours_Lost \"Love's Labours Lost\")_ (1598), although\nRosalin _d_ is the name of the main female character in _[As You Like\nIt](/wiki/As_You_Like_It \"As You Like It\")_. Scholars have found similarities\nbetween them: both are described as beautiful, and both have a way of avoiding\nmen's romantic advances. Rosaline in _Love 's Labours Lost_ constantly rebuffs\nher suitor's advances and Romeo's Rosaline remains distant and chaste in his\nbrief descriptions of her. These similarities have led some to wonder whether\nthey are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the [Dark\nLady](/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_sonnets#The_Dark_Lady \"Shakespeare's sonnets\")\ndescribed in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this\nconnection.[12]\n\n### Rosaline as plot\ndevice[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rosaline&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section:\nRosaline as plot device\")]\n\nAnalysts note that Rosaline acts as a plot device, by motivating Romeo to\nsneak into the Capulet party where he will meet Juliet. Without her, their\nmeeting would be unlikely.[13] Rosaline thus acts as the impetus to bring the\n\"star-cross'd lovers\" to their deaths—she is crucial in shaping their fate (a\ncommon theme of the play). Ironically, she remains oblivious of her role.[14]\n\n### Rosaline and\nJuliet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rosaline&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section:\nRosaline and Juliet\")]\n\n\"Rosaline and Paris...are the subtlest reflectors of all...they are cast like\na snake's skin by the more robust reality of Romeo and Juliet.\"\n\n—Ruth Nevo, on the Rosaline-Juliet, Paris-Romeo comparison[15]\n\nLiterary critics often compare Romeo's love for Rosaline with his feelings for\nJuliet. Some see Romeo's supposed love for Rosaline as childish as compared\nwith his true love for Juliet. Others argue that the apparent difference in\nRomeo's feelings shows Shakespeare's improving skill. Since Shakespeare is\nthought to have written early drafts of the play in 1591, and then picked them\nup again in 1597 to create the final copy, the change in Romeo's language for\nRosaline and Juliet may mirror Shakespeare's increased skill as a playwright:\nthe younger Shakespeare describing Rosaline, and the more experienced\ndescribing Juliet. In this view, a careful look at the play reveals that\nRomeo's love for Rosaline is not as petty as usually imagined.[13]\n\nCritics also note the ways in which Romeo's relationship with Rosaline\nprepares him for meeting Juliet. Before meeting Rosaline, Romeo despises all\nCapulets, but afterwards looks upon them more favourably. He experiences the\ndual feelings of hate and love in the one relationship. This prepares him for\nthe more mature relationship with Juliet—one fraught by the feud between\nMontagues and Capulets. Romeo expresses the conflict of love and hate in Act\n1, Scene 1, comparing his love for Rosaline with the feud between the two\nhouses:[16]\n\n> Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.  \n>\n>\n> Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!  \n>  O any thing, of nothing first create!  \n>  O heavy lightness! serious vanity!  \n>  Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!  \n>  Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!  \n>  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!  \n>  This love feel I, that feel no love in this.  \n>  Dost thou not laugh?\n\n[Psychoanalytic critics](/wiki/Psychoanalytic_criticism \"Psychoanalytic\ncriticism\") see signs of repressed [childhood trauma](/wiki/Childhood_trauma\n\"Childhood trauma\") in Romeo's love for Rosaline. She is of a rival house and\nis sworn to chastity. Thus he is in an impossible situation, one which will\ncontinue his trauma if he remains in it. Although he acknowledges its\nridiculous nature, he refuses to stop loving her. Psychoanalysts view this as\na re-enactment of his failed relationship with his mother. Rosaline's absence\nis symbolic of his mother's absence and lack of affection for him. Romeo's\nlove for Juliet is similarly hopeless, for she is a Capulet and Romeo pursues\nhis relationship with her; the difference being that Juliet reciprocates.[17]\nThis does not seem likely seeing as his mother died of grief after his\nbanishment, indicating that she probably loved him deeply.\n\n## Performances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rosaline&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Performances\")]\n\nRosaline has been portrayed in various ways over the centuries. [Theophilus\nCibber](/wiki/Theophilus_Cibber \"Theophilus Cibber\")'s 1748 version of _[Romeo\nand Juliet](/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet \"Romeo and Juliet\")_ replaced references to\nRosaline with references to Juliet. This, according to critics, took out the\n\"love at first sight\" moment at the Capulet feast.[18] In the 1750s, actor and\ntheatre director [David Garrick](/wiki/David_Garrick \"David Garrick\") also\neliminated references to Rosaline from his performances, as many saw Romeo's\nquick replacement of her as immoral.[19][20] However, in [Franco\nZeffirelli](/wiki/Franco_Zeffirelli \"Franco Zeffirelli\")'s 1968 film version\nof _[Romeo and Juliet](/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet_\\(1968_film\\) \"Romeo and Juliet\n\\(1968 film\\)\")_ , Romeo sees Rosaline (played by [Paola\nTedesco](/wiki/Paola_Tedesco \"Paola Tedesco\"))[21] first at the Capulet feast\nand then Juliet, of whom he becomes immediately enamoured. This scene suggests\nthat love is short and superficial. Rosaline also appears in Renato\nCastellani's 1954 film version. In a brief non-Shakespearean scene, Rosaline\n(Dagmar Josipovitch) gives Romeo a mask at Capulet's celebration, and urges\nhim to leave disguised before harm comes to him. Other filmmakers keep\nRosaline off-camera in stricter accordance with Shakespeare's script.[22]\nRosaline also appears in the 2013 film adaptation of Romeo & Juliet.\n\nRobert Nathan's 1966 romantic comedy, _Juliet in Mantua_ , presents Rosaline\nas a fully developed character. In this sequel, in which Romeo and Juliet did\n_not_ die, the pair live ten years later in exile in Mantua. After they are\nforgiven and return to Verona, they learn that Rosaline is now married to\nCounty Paris, and both couples must confront their disillusionment with their\nmarriages. Another play, _[After Juliet](/wiki/After_Juliet \"After Juliet\")_ ,\nwritten by Scottish playwright [Sharman Macdonald](/wiki/Sharman_Macdonald\n\"Sharman Macdonald\"), tells the story of Rosaline after Romeo dies. A main\ncharacter in this play, she struggles with her loss and turns away the\nadvances of [Benvolio](/wiki/Benvolio \"Benvolio\"), who has fallen in love with\nher. Macdonald's daughter, [Keira Knightley](/wiki/Keira_Knightley \"Keira\nKnightley\"), played Rosaline in the play's 1999 premiere.[23][24] The 2012\nyoung adult novel \"When You Were Mine\" by Rebecca Serle sets Rosaline's story\nin a contemporary high school. Rosaline and Romeo (renamed Rob) have been best\nfriends since childhood and are just beginning to fall in love when Rosaline's\ncousin, Juliet, moves back into town and sets her sights on Rob.[25] Important\ncharacter in sequel named \"Plague on both your houses!\" (1994) by [Grigori\nGorin](/wiki/Grigori_Gorin \"Grigori Gorin\").\n\n[Still Star-Crossed](/wiki/Still_Star-Crossed \"Still Star-Crossed\") (2017) –\nperiod drama television series created by Heather Mitchell and based on the\nbook with same name by [Melinda\nTaub](/w/index.php?title=Melinda_Taub&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Melinda Taub\n\\(page does not exist\\)\"). It follows Rosaline (played by Lashana Lynch). She\nand Benvolio of Montague are betrothed against their will by Prince Escalus,\nto end the feud between the two families. Both resolve to find a way to end\nthe violence without having the union.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rosaline&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** _Romeo and Juliet_ , I.2.99–100.\n  2. **Jump up ^** _Romeo and Juliet_ , I.1.231–232.\n  3. **Jump up ^** _Romeo and Juliet_ , II.4.4–5.\n  4. **Jump up ^** _Romeo and Juliet_ , I.2.365.\n  5. **Jump up ^** _Romeo and Juliet_ , I.5.59–60.\n  6. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Goldberg, Jonathan. _Queering the Renaissance_.
