Robotically-assisted\nsurgery was developed to overcome the limitations of pre-existing [minimally-\ninvasive surgical procedures](/wiki/Minimally-invasive_procedures \"Minimally-\ninvasive procedures\") and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing\nopen surgery.\n\nIn the case of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of\ndirectly moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to\ncontrol the instruments; either a direct\n[telemanipulator](/wiki/Remote_manipulator \"Remote manipulator\") or through\ncomputer control. A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the\nsurgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery whilst the\n[robotic arms](/wiki/Robotic_arm \"Robotic arm\") carry out those movements\nusing [end-effectors](/wiki/Robot_end_effector \"Robot end effector\") and\n[manipulators](/wiki/Manipulator_\\(device\\) \"Manipulator \\(device\\)\") to\nperform the actual surgery on the patient. In computer-controlled systems the\nsurgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors,\nthough these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One\nadvantage of using the computerised method is that the surgeon does not have\nto be present, but can be anywhere in the world, leading to the possibility\nfor [remote surgery](/wiki/Remote_surgery \"Remote surgery\").\n\nIn the case of enhanced open surgery, autonomous instruments (in familiar\nconfigurations) replace traditional steel tools, performing certain actions\n(such as rib spreading) with much smoother, feedback-controlled motions than\ncould be achieved by a human hand. The main object of such smart instruments\nis to reduce or eliminate the tissue trauma traditionally associated with open\nsurgery without requiring more than a few minutes' training on the part of\nsurgeons. This approach seeks to improve open surgeries, particularly cardio-\nthoracic, that have so far not benefited from minimally-invasive techniques.\n\nRobotic surgery has been criticized for its expense, by one estimate costing\n$1,500 to $2000 more per patient.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Comparison to traditional methods\n  * 2 Uses\n    * 2.1 General surgery\n    * 2.2 Cardiothoracic surgery\n    * 2.3 Cardiology and electrophysiology\n    * 2.4 Colon and rectal surgery\n    * 2.5 Gastrointestinal surgery\n    * 2.6 Gynecology\n    * 2.7 Neurosurgery\n    * 2.8 Ophthalmology\n    * 2.9 Orthopedics\n    * 2.10 Children\n    * 2.11 Radiosurgery\n    * 2.12 Spine surgery\n    * 2.13 Transplant surgery\n    * 2.14 Urology\n    * 2.15 Vascular surgery\n  * 3 Miniature robotics\n  * 4 History\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Comparison to traditional methods[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Comparison to\ntraditional methods\")]\n\nMajor advances aided by surgical robots have been [remote\nsurgery](/wiki/Remote_surgery \"Remote surgery\"), [minimally invasive\nsurgery](/wiki/Minimally_invasive_surgery \"Minimally invasive surgery\") and\nunmanned surgery. Due to robotic use, the surgery is done with precision,\nminiaturization, smaller incisions; decreased blood loss, less pain, and\nquicker healing time. Articulation beyond normal manipulation and three-\ndimensional magnification helps resulting in improved ergonomics. Due to these\ntechniques there is a reduced duration of hospital stays, blood loss,\ntransfusions, and use of pain medication.[2] The existing open surgery\ntechnique has many flaws like limited access to surgical area, long recovery\ntime, long hours of operation, blood loss, surgical scars and marks.[3]\n\nThe robot normally costs $1,390,000 and while its disposable supply cost is\nnormally $1,500 per procedure, the cost of the procedure is higher.[1]\nAdditional surgical training is needed to operate the system.[4] Numerous\nfeasibility studies have been done to determine whether the purchase of such\nsystems are worthwhile. As it stands, opinions differ dramatically. Surgeons\nreport that, although the manufacturers of such systems provide training on\nthis new technology, the learning phase is intensive and surgeons must operate\non twelve to eighteen patients before they adapt. During the training phase,\nminimally invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional\nsurgery, leading to operating room tie ups and surgical staffs keeping\npatients under anesthesia for longer periods. Patient surveys indicate they\nchose the procedure based on expectations of decreased morbidity, improved\noutcomes, reduced blood loss and less pain.[2] Higher expectations may explain\nhigher rates of dissatisfaction and regret.[4]\n\nCompared with other minimally invasive surgery approaches, robot-assisted\nsurgery gives the surgeon better control over the surgical instruments and a\nbetter view of the surgical site. In addition, surgeons no longer have to\nstand throughout the surgery and do not tire as quickly. Naturally occurring\nhand tremors are filtered out by the robot's computer software. Finally, the\nsurgical robot can continuously be used by rotating surgery teams.[5]\n\nCritics of the system, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists,[6] say there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt\nuse of the system and that there's a lack of studies that indicate long-term\nresults are superior to results following traditional [laparoscopic\nsurgery](/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery \"Laparoscopic surgery\").[1] Articles in\nthe newly created _[Journal of Robotic\nSurgery](/wiki/Journal_of_Robotic_Surgery \"Journal of Robotic Surgery\")_ tend\nto report on one surgeon's experience.[1]\n\nA Medicare study found that some procedures that have traditionally been\nperformed with large incisions can be converted to \"minimally invasive\"\nendoscopic procedures with the use of the [Da Vinci Surgical\nSystem](/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System \"Da Vinci Surgical System\"), shortening\nlength-of-stay in the hospital and reducing recovery times. But because of the\nhefty cost of the robotic system it is not clear that it is cost-effective for\nhospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no\nadditional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when\nthe system is used.[1]\n\nRobot-assisted [pancreatectomies](/wiki/Pancreatectomy \"Pancreatectomy\") have\nbeen found to be associated with \"longer operating time, lower estimated blood\nloss, a higher spleen-preservation rate, and shorter hospital stay[s]\" than\nlaparoscopic pancreatectomies; there was \"no significant difference in\ntransfusion, conversion to open surgery, overall complications, severe\ncomplications, pancreatic fistula, severe pancreatic fistula, ICU stay, total\ncost, and 30-day mortality between the two groups.\"[7] For surgical removal of\nthe uterus and cervix for early [cervical cancer](/wiki/Cervical_cancer\n\"Cervical cancer\") robotic and laparoscopic surgery resulted in similar\noutcomes with respect to the cancer.[8]\n\n## Uses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-assisted_surgery&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Uses\")]\n\n### General surgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: General surgery\")]\n\nIn early 2000 the field of general surgical interventions with the daVinci\ndevice was explored by surgeons at Ohio State University. Reports were\npublished in esophageal and pancreatic surgery for the first time in the world\nand further data were subsequently published by Horgan and his group at the\nUniversity of Illinois and then later at the same institution by\nothers.[9][10] In 2007, the [University of Illinois at\nChicago](/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Chicago \"University of Illinois at\nChicago\") medical team, led by [Prof. Pier Cristoforo\nGiulianotti](/wiki/Prof._Pier_Cristoforo_Giulianotti \"Prof. Pier Cristoforo\nGiulianotti\"), reported a [pancreatectomy](/wiki/Pancreatectomy\n\"Pancreatectomy\") and also the Midwest's first fully robotic [Whipple\nsurgery](/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy \"Pancreaticoduodenectomy\"). In April\n2008, the same team of surgeons performed the world's first fully minimally\ninvasive [liver](/wiki/Liver \"Liver\") resection for [living donor\ntransplantation](/wiki/Living_donor_liver_transplantation \"Living donor liver\ntransplantation\"), removing 60% of the patient's liver, yet allowing him to\nleave the hospital just a couple of days after the procedure, in very good\ncondition. Furthermore, the patient can also leave with less pain than a usual\nsurgery due to the four puncture holes and not a scar by a surgeon.[11]\n\n### Cardiothoracic surgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Cardiothoracic\nsurgery\")]\n\nRobot-assisted [MIDCAB](/wiki/MIDCAB \"MIDCAB\") and [Endoscopic coronary artery\nbypass](/wiki/TECAB \"TECAB\") (TECAB) operations are being performed with the\n[Da Vinci system](/wiki/Da_Vinci_robot \"Da Vinci robot\"). [Mitral\nvalve](/wiki/Mitral_valve \"Mitral valve\") repairs and replacements have been\nperformed. The Ohio State University, Columbus has performed [CABG](/wiki/CABG\n\"CABG\"), [mitral valve](/wiki/Mitral_valve \"Mitral valve\"),\n[esophagectomy](/wiki/Esophagectomy \"Esophagectomy\"), [lung](/wiki/Lung\n\"Lung\") resection, tumor resections, among other robotic assisted procedures\nand serves as a training site for other surgeons. In 2002, surgeons at the\n[Cleveland Clinic](/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic \"Cleveland Clinic\") in Florida\nreported and published their preliminary experience with minimally invasive\n\"hybrid\" procedures. These procedures combined robotic\n[revascularization](/wiki/Revascularization \"Revascularization\") and [coronary\nstenting](/wiki/Coronary_stenting \"Coronary stenting\") and further expanded\nthe role of robots in [coronary bypass](/wiki/Coronary_bypass \"Coronary\nbypass\") to patients with disease in multiple vessels. Ongoing research on the\noutcomes of robotic assisted CABG and hybrid CABG is being done.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Cardiology and electrophysiology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Cardiology and\nelectrophysiology\")]\n\nAs of 2004, three types of heart surgery are being performed on a routine\nbasis using robotic surgery systems.[12] These three surgery types were:\n\n  * Atrial septal defect repair – the repair of a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart,\n  * Mitral valve repair – the repair of the valve that prevents blood from regurgitating back into the upper heart chambers during contractions of the heart,\n  * Coronary artery bypass – rerouting of blood supply by bypassing blocked arteries that provide blood to the heart.\n\n### Colon and rectal surgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Colon and rectal\nsurgery\")]\n\nMany studies have been undertaken in order to examine the role of robotic\nprocedures in the field of [colorectal surgery](/wiki/Colorectal_surgery\n\"Colorectal surgery\").[13][14]\n\nResults to date indicate that robotic-assisted colorectal procedures outcomes\nare \"no worse\" than the results in the now \"traditional\" laparoscopic\ncolorectal operations. Robotic-assisted colorectal surgery appears to be safe\nas well.[15] Most of the procedures have been performed for malignant colon\nand rectal lesions. However, surgeons are now moving into resections for\ndiverticulitis and non-resective rectopexies (attaching the colon to the\nsacrum in order to treat rectal prolapse.)\n\nWhen evaluated for several variables, robotic-assisted procedures fare equally\nwell when compared with laparoscopic, or open abdominal operations. Study\nparameters have looked at intraoperative patient preparation time, length of\ntime to perform the operation, adequacy of the removed surgical specimen with\nrespect to clear surgical margins and number of lymph nodes removed, blood\nloss, operative or postoperative complications and long-term results.\n\nMore difficult to evaluate are issues related to the view of the operative\nfield, the types of procedures that should be performed using robotic\nassistance and the potential added cost for a robotic operation.\n\nMany surgeons feel that the optics of the 3-dimensional, two camera stereo\noptic robotic system are superior to the optical system used in laparoscopic\nprocedures. The pelvic nerves are clearly visualized during robotic-assisted\nprocedures. Less clear however is whether or not these supposedly improved\noptics and visualization improve patient outcomes with respect to\npostoperative impotence or incontinence, and whether long-term patient\nsurvival is improved by using the 3-dimensional optic system. Additionally,\nthere is often a need for a wider, or \"larger\" view of the operative field\nthan is routinely provided during robotic operations.,[16] The close-up view\nof the area under dissection may hamper visualization of the \"bigger view\",\nespecially with respect to ureteral protection.\n\nQuestions remain unanswered, even after many years of experience with robotic-\nassisted colorectal operations. Ongoing studies may help clarify many of the\nissues of confusion associated with this novel surgical approach.\n\n### Gastrointestinal surgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Gastrointestinal\nsurgery\")]\n\nMultiple types of procedures have been performed with either the 'Zeus' or [da\nVinci](/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System \"Da Vinci Surgical System\") robot\nsystems, including [bariatric surgery](/wiki/Bariatric_surgery \"Bariatric\nsurgery\") and [gastrectomy](/wiki/Gastrectomy \"Gastrectomy\")[17] for cancer.\nSurgeons at various universities initially published case series demonstrating\ndifferent techniques and the feasibility of GI surgery using the robotic\ndevices.[10] Specific procedures have been more fully evaluated, specifically\nesophageal fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux[18] and\nHeller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia.[19][20]\n\nOther gastrointestinal procedures including colon resection, pancreatectomy,\nesophagectomy and robotic approaches to pelvic disease have also been\nreported.\n\n### Gynecology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Gynecology\")]\n\nRobotic surgery in [gynecology](/wiki/Gynecology \"Gynecology\") is of uncertain\nbenefit with it being unclear if it affects rates of complications.\nGynecologic procedures may take longer with robot-assisted surgery but may be\nassociated with a shorter hospital stay following hysterectomy.[21] In the\nUnited States, robotic-assisted hysterectomy for benign conditions has been\nshown to be more expensive than conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy, with\nno difference in overall rates of complications.[22]\n\nThis includes the use of the da Vinci surgical system in benign gynecology and\ngynecologic [oncology](/wiki/Oncology \"Oncology\"). Robotic surgery can be used\nto treat [fibroids](/wiki/Fibroma \"Fibroma\"), abnormal periods,\n[endometriosis](/wiki/Endometriosis \"Endometriosis\"), [ovarian\ntumors](/wiki/Ovarian_tumor \"Ovarian tumor\"), [uterine\nprolapse](/wiki/Uterine_prolapse \"Uterine prolapse\"), and female cancers.\nUsing the robotic system, gynecologists can perform hysterectomies,\nmyomectomies, and lymph node biopsies.\n\n### Neurosurgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Neurosurgery\")]\n\nSeveral systems for [stereotactic intervention](/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery\n\"Stereotactic surgery\") are currently on the market. The NeuroMate was the\nfirst neurosurgical robot, commercially available in 1997.[23] Originally\ndeveloped in Grenoble by Alim-Louis_Benabid's team, it is now owned by\n[Renishaw](/wiki/Renishaw_plc \"Renishaw plc\"). With installations in the\nUnited States, Europe and Japan, the system has been used in 8000 stereotactic\nbrain surgeries by 2009. [IMRIS](/wiki/IMRIS \"IMRIS\") Inc.'s SYMBIS(TM)\nSurgical System[24] will be the version of [NeuroArm](/wiki/NeuroArm\n\"NeuroArm\"), the world's first [MRI](/wiki/MRI \"MRI\")-compatible surgical\nrobot, developed for world-wide commercialization. Medtech's Rosa is being\nused by several institutions, including the Cleveland Clinic in the U.S, and\nin Canada at Sherbrooke University and the [Montreal Neurological Institute\nand Hospital](/wiki/Montreal_Neurological_Institute \"Montreal Neurological\nInstitute\") in Montreal (MNI/H). Between June 2011 and September 2012, over\n150 neurosurgical procedures at the MNI/H have been completed robotized\nstereotaxy, including in the placement of depth electrodes in the treatment of\nepilepsy, selective resections, and stereotaxic biopsies.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Ophthalmology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Ophthalmology\")]\n\nThe first robotic operation inside the eye took place at the [John Radcliffe\nHospital](/wiki/John_Radcliffe_Hospital \"John Radcliffe Hospital\") in\n[Oxford](/wiki/Oxford \"Oxford\") on 9 September 2016. The robot was developed\nby [Preceyes BV](/w/index.php?title=Preceyes_BV&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Preceyes BV \\(page does not exist\\)\") and the surgery was performed by\n[Robert MacLaren](/wiki/Robert_MacLaren \"Robert MacLaren\"), Professor of\nOphthalmology at the [University of Oxford](/wiki/University_of_Oxford\n\"University of Oxford\").[25] They operated successfully on the Reverend Dr\nWilliam Beaver, a 70 year old man with a [macular hole](/wiki/Macular_hole\n\"Macular hole\").[26] The researchers commented that robotic eye surgery has\ntaken longer to develop due to the need to miniaturise the components. They\nobserved that the robot could make controlled movements inside the eye as\nsmall as 100th of a millimetre.[27]\n\n### Orthopedics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Orthopedics\")]\n\nThe [ROBODOC](/w/index.php?title=ROBODOC&action=edit&redlink=1 \"ROBODOC \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") system was released in 1992 by [Integrated Surgical\nSystems,\nInc.](/w/index.php?title=Integrated_Surgical_Systems,_Inc.&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc. \\(page does not exist\\)\") which merged into\n[CUREXO Technology\nCorporation](/w/index.php?title=CUREXO_Technology_Corporation&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"CUREXO Technology Corporation \\(page does not exist\\)\").[28] Also, The\n[Acrobot Company\nLtd.](/w/index.php?title=Acrobot_Company_Ltd.&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Acrobot\nCompany Ltd. \\(page does not exist\\)\") developed the \"[Acrobot\nSculptor](/w/index.php?title=Acrobot_Sculptor&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Acrobot\nSculptor \\(page does not exist\\)\")\", a robot that constrained a\n[bone](/wiki/Bone \"Bone\") cutting tool to a pre-defined volume. The \"Acrobot\nSculptor\" was sold to Stanmore Implants in August 2010. Stanmore received FDA\nclearance in February 2013 for US surgeries but sold the Sculptor to Mako\nSurgical in June 2013 to resolve a patent infringement lawsuit.[29] Another\nexample is the CASPAR robot produced by U.R.S.which is used for [total hip\nreplacement](/wiki/Hip_replacement \"Hip replacement\"), [total knee\nreplacement](/wiki/Knee_replacement \"Knee replacement\") and [anterior cruciate\nligament](/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament \"Anterior cruciate ligament\")\nreconstruction.[30] MAKO Surgical Corp (founded 2004) produces the RIO\n(Robotic Arm Interactive Orthopedic System) which combines robotics,\nnavigation, and haptics for both partial knee and total hip replacement\nsurgery.[31] Blue Belt Technologies received FDA clearance in November 2012\nfor the Navio Surgical System. The Navio System is a navigated, robotics-\nassisted surgical system that uses a CT free approach to assist in partial\nknee replacement surgery.[32]\n\n### Children[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Children\")]\n\nSurgical robotics has been used in many types of pediatric surgical procedures\nincluding: [tracheoesophageal fistula](/wiki/Tracheoesophageal_fistula\n\"Tracheoesophageal fistula\") repair, [cholecystectomy](/wiki/Cholecystectomy\n\"Cholecystectomy\"), [nissen fundoplication](/wiki/Nissen_fundoplication\n\"Nissen fundoplication\"), [morgagni's hernia](/wiki/Morgagni%27s_hernia\n\"Morgagni's hernia\") repair, [kasai\nportoenterostomy](/wiki/Kasai_portoenterostomy \"Kasai portoenterostomy\"),\n[congenital diaphragmatic hernia](/wiki/Congenital_diaphragmatic_hernia\n\"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia\") repair, and others. On 17 January 2002,\nsurgeons at [Children's Hospital of\nMichigan](/wiki/Children%27s_Hospital_of_Michigan \"Children's Hospital of\nMichigan\") in Detroit performed the nation's first advanced computer-assisted\nrobot-enhanced surgical procedure at a children's hospital.\n\nThe Center for Robotic Surgery at [Children's Hospital\nBoston](/wiki/Children%27s_Hospital_Boston \"Children's Hospital Boston\")\nprovides a high level of expertise in pediatric robotic surgery. Specially-\ntrained surgeons use a high-tech robot to perform complex and delicate\noperations through very small surgical openings. The results are less pain,\nfaster recoveries, shorter hospital stays, smaller scars, and happier patients\nand families.\n\nIn 2001, Children's Hospital Boston was the first [pediatric](/wiki/Pediatrics\n\"Pediatrics\") hospital to acquire a surgical robot. Today, surgeons use the\ntechnology for many procedures and perform more pediatric robotic operations\nthan any other hospital in the world. Children's Hospital physicians have\ndeveloped a number of new applications to expand the use of the robot, and\ntrain surgeons from around the world on its use.[33]\n\n### Radiosurgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: Radiosurgery\")]\n\nThe [CyberKnife](/wiki/CyberKnife \"CyberKnife\") Robotic\n[Radiosurgery](/wiki/Radiosurgery \"Radiosurgery\") System uses image guidance\nand computer controlled robotics to treat tumors throughout the body by\ndelivering multiple beams of high-energy radiation to the tumor from virtually\nany direction. The system uses a German [KUKA](/wiki/KUKA \"KUKA\") KR 240.\nMounted on the robot is a compact X-band [linac](/wiki/Linac \"Linac\") that\nproduces 6MV X-ray radiation. Mounting the radiation source on the robot\nallows very fast repositioning of the source, which enables the system to\ndeliver radiation from many different directions without the need to move both\nthe patient and source as required by current gantry configurations.\n\n### Spine surgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Spine surgery\")]\n\nRobotic devices started to be used in [minimally invasive spine\nsurgery](/wiki/Minimally_Invasive_Spine_Surgery \"Minimally Invasive Spine\nSurgery\") starting in the mid-2000s.[34] As of 2014, there were too few\nrandomized clinical trials to allow judgements as to whether robotic spine\nsurgery is more or less safe than other approaches.[34]\n\n### Transplant surgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: Transplant surgery\")]\n\nTransplant surgery ([organ transplantation](/wiki/Organ_transplantation \"Organ\ntransplantation\")) has been considered as highly technically demanding and\nvirtually unobtainable by means of conventional laparoscopy. For many years,\ntransplant patients were unable to benefit from the advantages of minimally\ninvasive surgery. The development of robotic technology and its associated\nhigh resolution capabilities, three dimensional visual system, wrist type\nmotion and fine instruments, gave opportunity for highly complex procedures to\nbe completed in a minimally invasive fashion. Subsequently, the first fully\nrobotic kidney transplantations were performed in the late 2000s. After the\nprocedure was proven to be feasible and safe, the main emerging challenge was\nto determine which patients would benefit most from this robotic technique. As\na result, recognition of the increasing prevalence of obesity amongst patients\nwith kidney failure on hemodialysis posed a significant problem. Due to the\nabundantly higher risk of complications after traditional open kidney\ntransplantation, obese patients were frequently denied access to\ntransplantation, which is the premium treatment for end stage kidney disease.\nThe use of the robotic-assisted approach has allowed kidneys to be\ntransplanted with minimal incisions, which has virtually alleviated wound\ncomplications and significantly shortened the recovery period. The [University\nof Illinois Medical Center](/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Medical_Center\n\"University of Illinois Medical Center\") reported the largest series of 104\nrobotic-assisted kidney transplants for obese recipients (mean [body mass\nindex](/wiki/Body_mass_index \"Body mass index\") > 42). Amongst this group of\npatients, no wound infections were observed and the function of transplanted\nkidneys was excellent. In this way, robotic kidney transplantation could be\nconsidered as the biggest advance in surgical technique for this procedure\nsince its creation more than half a century ago.[35][36][37]\n\n### Urology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Urology\")]\n\nRobotic surgery in the field of urology has become very popular, especially in\nthe United States.[38] It has been most extensively applied for excision of\nprostate cancer because of difficult anatomical access. It is also utilized\nfor [kidney](/wiki/Kidney \"Kidney\") cancer surgeries and to lesser extent\nsurgeries of the [bladder](/wiki/Bladder \"Bladder\").\n\nAs of 2014, there is little evidence of increased benefits compared to\nstandard surgery to justify the increased costs.[39] Some have found tentative\nevidence of more complete removal of cancer and less side effects from surgery\nfor prostatectomy.[40]\n\nIn 2000, the first robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was\nperformed.[4]\n\n### Vascular surgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Vascular surgery\")]\n\nIn September 2010, the first robotic operations with [Hansen\nMedical](/wiki/Hansen_Medical \"Hansen Medical\")'s Magellan Robotic System at\nthe [femoral vasculature](/wiki/Femoral_vasculature \"Femoral vasculature\")\nwere performed at the [University Medical Centre\nLjubljana](/wiki/University_Medical_Centre_Ljubljana \"University Medical\nCentre Ljubljana\") (UMC Ljubljana), [Slovenia](/wiki/Slovenia \"Slovenia\"). The\nresearch was led by [Borut\nGeršak](/w/index.php?title=Borut_Ger%C5%A1ak&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Borut\nGeršak \\(page does not exist\\)\"), the head of the Department of Cardiovascular\nSurgery at the centre. Geršak explained that the robot used was the first true\nrobot in the history of robotic surgery, meaning the user interface was not\nresembling surgical instruments and the robot was not simply imitating the\nmovement of human hands but was guided by pressing buttons, just like one\nwould play a video game. The robot was imported to Slovenia from the United\nStates.[41][42]\n\n## Miniature robotics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Miniature robotics\")]\n\nAs scientists seek to improve the versatility and utility of robotics in\nsurgery, some are attempting to miniaturize the robots. For example, the\n[University of Nebraska Medical\nCenter](/wiki/University_of_Nebraska_Medical_Center \"University of Nebraska\nMedical Center\") has led a multi-campus effort to provide collaborative\nresearch on [mini-robotics](/w/index.php?title=Mini-\nrobotics&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Mini-robotics \\(page does not exist\\)\") among\nsurgeons, engineers and computer scientists.[43]\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe first robot to assist in surgery was the _Arthrobot_ , which was developed\nand used for the first time in [Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver \"Vancouver\") in\n1983.[44] Intimately involved were [biomedical\nengineer](/wiki/Biomedical_engineering \"Biomedical engineering\"), [Dr. James\nMcEwen](/wiki/James_McEwen_\\(engineer\\) \"James McEwen \\(engineer\\)\"), Geof\nAuchinleck, a UBC [engineering physics](/wiki/Engineering_physics \"Engineering\nphysics\") grad, and [Dr. Brian Day](/wiki/Brian_Day \"Brian Day\") as well as a\nteam of engineering students. The robot was used in an\n[orthopaedic](/wiki/Orthopaedy \"Orthopaedy\") surgical procedure on 12 March\n1984, at the [UBC Hospital](/wiki/UBC_Hospital \"UBC Hospital\") in Vancouver.\nOver 60 [arthroscopic](/wiki/Arthroscopy \"Arthroscopy\") surgical procedures\nwere performed in the first 12 months, and a 1985 [National\nGeographic](/wiki/National_Geographic_Society \"National Geographic Society\")\nvideo on industrial robots, _The Robotics Revolution_ , featured the device.\nOther related robotic devices developed at the same time included a surgical\n[scrub nurse](/wiki/Scrub_nurse \"Scrub nurse\") robot, which handed operative\ninstruments on voice command, and a medical laboratory robotic arm. A YouTube\nvideo entitled _Arthrobot_ illustrates some of these in operation.\n\nIn 1985 a robot, the [Unimation Puma\n200](/wiki/Programmable_Universal_Machine_for_Assembly \"Programmable Universal\nMachine for Assembly\"), was used to place a needle for a brain biopsy using CT\nguidance.[45] In 1992, the PROBOT, developed at [Imperial College\nLondon](/wiki/Imperial_College_London \"Imperial College London\"), was used to\nperform prostatic surgery by Dr. Senthil Nathan at Guy's and St Thomas'\nHospital, London. This was the first pure robotic surgery in the world. The\nPROBOT was specifically designed for transurethral resection of the prostate.\nMeanwhile, when PROBOT was being developed, ROBODOC, a robotic system designed\nto assist hip replacement surgeries was the first surgical robot that was\napproved by the FDA.[46] The ROBODOC from Integrated Surgical Systems (working\nclosely with [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\")) was introduced in 1992 to mill out\nprecise fittings in the [femur](/wiki/Femur \"Femur\") for hip replacement.[47]\nThe purpose of the ROBODOC was to replace the previous method of carving out a\nfemur for an implant, the use of a mallet and broach/rasp.\n\nFurther development of robotic systems was carried out by [SRI\nInternational](/wiki/SRI_International \"SRI International\") and [Intuitive\nSurgical](/wiki/Intuitive_Surgical \"Intuitive Surgical\") with the introduction\nof the [da Vinci Surgical System](/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System \"Da Vinci\nSurgical System\") and [Computer Motion](/wiki/Computer_Motion \"Computer\nMotion\") with the _AESOP_ and the [ZEUS robotic surgical\nsystem](/wiki/ZEUS_robotic_surgical_system \"ZEUS robotic surgical\nsystem\").[48] The first robotic surgery took place at [The Ohio State\nUniversity Medical Center](/wiki/The_Ohio_State_University_Medical_Center \"The\nOhio State University Medical Center\") in [Columbus](/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio\n\"Columbus, Ohio\"), Ohio under the direction of [Robert E.\nMichler](/wiki/Robert_E._Michler \"Robert E. Michler\").[49] Examples of using\nZEUS include a fallopian tube reconnection in July 1998,[50] a _beating heart_\ncoronary artery bypass graft in October 1999,[51] and the [Lindbergh\nOperation](/wiki/Lindbergh_Operation \"Lindbergh Operation\"), which was a\n[cholecystectomy](/wiki/Cholecystectomy \"Cholecystectomy\") performed remotely\nin September 2001.[52]\n\nThe original telesurgery robotic system that the da Vinci was based on was\ndeveloped at SRI International in Menlo Park with grant support from DARPA and\nNASA.[53] Although the telesurgical robot was originally intended to\nfacilitate remotely performed surgery in battlefield and other remote\nenvironments, it turned out to be more useful for minimally invasive on-site\nsurgery. The patents for the early prototype were sold to Intuitive Surgical\nin Mountain View, California. The da Vinci senses the surgeon's hand movements\nand translates them electronically into scaled-down micro-movements to\nmanipulate the tiny proprietary instruments. It also detects and filters out\nany tremors in the surgeon's hand movements, so that they are not duplicated\nrobotically. The camera used in the system provides a true stereoscopic\npicture transmitted to a surgeon's console. Examples of using the da Vinci\nsystem include the first robotically assisted [heart\nbypass](/wiki/Heart_bypass \"Heart bypass\") (performed in Germany) in May 1998,\nand the first performed in the United States in September 1999;[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] and the\nfirst all-robotic-assisted [kidney transplant](/wiki/Kidney_transplant \"Kidney\ntransplant\"), performed in January 2009.[54] The da Vinci Si was released in\nApril 2009, and initially sold for $1.75 million.[55]\n\nIn May 2006 the first [artificial intelligence](/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\n\"Artificial intelligence\") doctor-conducted unassisted robotic surgery on a\n34-year-old male to correct [heart\narythmia](/w/index.php?title=Heart_arythmia&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heart\narythmia \\(page does not exist\\)\"). The results were rated as better than an\nabove-average human surgeon. The machine had a [database](/wiki/Database\n\"Database\") of 10,000 similar operations, and so, in the words of its\ndesigners, was \"more than qualified to operate on any patient\".[56][57] In\nAugust 2007, Dr. Sijo Parekattil of the Robotics Institute and Center for\nUrology (Winter Haven Hospital and University of Florida) performed the first\nrobotic assisted microsurgery procedure denervation of the spermatic cord for\nchronic testicular pain.[58] In February 2008, Dr. Mohan S. Gundeti of the\n[University of Chicago Comer Children's\nHospital](/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Comer_Children%27s_Hospital \"University\nof Chicago Comer Children's Hospital\") performed the first robotic pediatric\nneurogenic bladder reconstruction.[59]\n\nOn 12 May 2008, the first image-guided MR-compatible robotic neurosurgical\nprocedure was performed at [University of Calgary](/wiki/University_of_Calgary\n\"University of Calgary\") by Dr. Garnette Sutherland using the\n[NeuroArm](/wiki/NeuroArm \"NeuroArm\").[60] In June 2008, the [German Aerospace\nCentre](/wiki/German_Aerospace_Centre \"German Aerospace Centre\") (DLR)\npresented a robotic system for minimally invasive surgery, the\n[MiroSurge](/wiki/MiroSurge \"MiroSurge\").[61] In September 2010, the\n[Eindhoven University of Technology](/wiki/Eindhoven_University_of_Technology\n\"Eindhoven University of Technology\") announced the development of the\n[Sofie](/wiki/Sofie_\\(surgical_robot\\) \"Sofie \\(surgical robot\\)\") surgical\nsystem, the first surgical robot to employ [force\nfeedback](/wiki/Force_feedback \"Force feedback\").[62] In September 2010, the\nfirst robotic operation at the [femoral vasculature](/wiki/Femoral_vasculature\n\"Femoral vasculature\") was performed at the [University Medical Centre\nLjubljana](/wiki/University_Medical_Centre_Ljubljana \"University Medical\nCentre Ljubljana\") by a team led by [Borut\nGeršak](/w/index.php?title=Borut_Ger%C5%A1ak&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Borut\nGeršak \\(page does not exist\\)\").[41][42]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Bone segment navigation](/wiki/Bone_segment_navigation \"Bone segment navigation\")\n  * [Computer-assisted surgery](/wiki/Computer-assisted_surgery \"Computer-assisted surgery\")\n  * [Computer-integrated surgery](/wiki/Computer-integrated_surgery \"Computer-integrated surgery\")\n  * [Minimally invasive surgery](/wiki/Minimally_invasive_surgery \"Minimally invasive surgery\")\n  * [Patient registration](/wiki/Patient_registration \"Patient registration\")\n  * [Stereolithography (medicine)](/wiki/Stereolithography_\\(medicine\\) \"Stereolithography \\(medicine\\)\")\n  * [Surgical Segment Navigator](/wiki/Surgical_Segment_Navigator \"Surgical Segment Navigator\")\n  * [Telemedicine](/wiki/Telemedicine \"Telemedicine\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Robot-\nassisted_surgery&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ Kolata, Gina (13 February 2010).
