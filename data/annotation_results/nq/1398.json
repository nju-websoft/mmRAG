However, the song was not released as a\npromotional single by Williams' record label ([Columbia\nRecords](/wiki/Columbia_Records \"Columbia Records\")) that year, as they\ninstead opted to promote his cover of [\"White\nChristmas\"](/wiki/White_Christmas_\\(song\\) \"White Christmas \\(song\\)\") as the\nofficial promo single from the album.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Song Content\n  * 2 Other notable versions\n  * 3 Use in advertising and parodies\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Song\nContent[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_the_Most_Wonderful_Time_of_the_Year&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Song Content\")]\n\nThe song is a celebration and description of activities associated with the\nChristmas season, focusing primarily on get-togethers between friends and\nfamilies. Among the activities included in the song is the telling of \"scary\nghost stories,\" a Victorian Christmas tradition that has mostly fallen into\ndisuse,[2][3] but survives in the seasonal popularity of numerous adaptations\nof [Charles Dickens](/wiki/Charles_Dickens \"Charles Dickens\")' _[A Christmas\nCarol](/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol \"A Christmas Carol\")_. Other activities\nmentioned include hosting parties, spontaneous visits from friends, universal\nsocial gaiety, spending time with loved ones, sledding for children, roasting\nmarshmallows, sharing stories about previous Christmases, and singing\n[Christmas carols](/wiki/Christmas_carol \"Christmas carol\") in winter weather.\n\nIn a 2005 interview, Williams discusses how _[The Andy Williams\nShow](/wiki/The_Andy_Williams_Show \"The Andy Williams Show\")_ figured into his\nrecording of \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\": \"George Wyle, who is\na vocal director, who wrote all of the choir stuff and all of the duets and\ntrios and things that I did with all the guests, he wrote a song just for the\nshow – I think the second Christmas show we did – called \"Most Wonderful Time\nof the Year\". So I did that, you know, every Christmas, and then other people\nstarted doing it. And then suddenly it's become – not suddenly but over 30\nyears – it's become a big standard. I think it's one of the top 10 Christmas\nsongs of all time now.\"[4]\n\nIn the issue of _Billboard_ magazine dated November 28, 2009, the list of the\n\"Top 10 Holiday Songs (Since 2001)\" places the Williams recording of \"It's the\nMost Wonderful Time of the Year\" at No. 5.[5] 2001 also marked the first year\nin which the [American Society of Composers, Authors and\nPublishers](/wiki/American_Society_of_Composers,_Authors_and_Publishers\n\"American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers\") (ASCAP) started\ncompiling data regarding the radio airplay of holiday songs, and although the\nWilliams classic started out at No. 25 of twenty-five songs that were ranked\nthat year,[6] it gained steam over the next ten years, reaching No. 18 in\n2002,[7] No. 13 in 2003,[8] and eventually getting to No. 4 in 2010.[9]\n\nThe song was selected as the theme song for [Christmas\nSeals](/wiki/Christmas_Seals \"Christmas Seals\") in both 2009 and 2012.\n\n## Other notable\nversions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_the_Most_Wonderful_Time_of_the_Year&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Other notable versions\")]\n\n  * [Johnny Mathis](/wiki/Johnny_Mathis \"Johnny Mathis\") recorded a version.[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_]\n  * [Amy Grant](/wiki/Amy_Grant \"Amy Grant\") recorded a version in 1992.\n  * 1999: [Garth Brooks](/wiki/Garth_Brooks \"Garth Brooks\") released a version of the song on his second holiday album, _[Garth Brooks and the Magic of Christmas](/wiki/Garth_Brooks_and_the_Magic_of_Christmas \"Garth Brooks and the Magic of Christmas\")_.
