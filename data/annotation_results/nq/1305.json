The main symptom is\nabdominal pain, which may last a few days to a several weeks, but they can\nalso be asymptomatic.[6] Rupture of large ovarian cysts can cause [bleeding\ninside the abdominal cavity](/wiki/Hemoperitoneum \"Hemoperitoneum\") and in\nsome cases shock.\n\n### Ovarian\ntorsion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Ovarian torsion\")]\n\nOvarian cysts increase the risk for [ovarian torsion](/wiki/Ovarian_torsion\n\"Ovarian torsion\"); cysts larger than 4 cm are associated with approximately\n17% risk. The torsion can cause obstruction of blood flow and lead to\n[infarction](/wiki/Infarction \"Infarction\").[7]\n\n## Diagnosis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Diagnosis\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/2cmleftovariancyst.png/220px-2cmleftovariancyst.png)](/wiki/File:2cmleftovariancyst.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2cmleftovariancyst.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA 2 cm left ovarian cyst as seen on ultrasound\n\nOvarian cysts are usually diagnosed by [ultrasound](/wiki/Ultrasound\n\"Ultrasound\"), [CT scan](/wiki/CT_scan \"CT scan\"), or\n[MRI](/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging \"Magnetic resonance imaging\"), and\ncorrelated with clinical presentation and endocrinologic tests as appropriate.\n\n### Ultrasound[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Ultrasound\")]\n\nFollow-up imaging in women of reproductive age for incidentally discovered\nsimple cysts on ultrasound is not needed until 5 cm, as these are usually\nnormal ovarian follicles. Simple cysts 5 to 7 cm in\n[premenopausal](/wiki/Menopause#Diagnosis \"Menopause\") females should be\nfollowed yearly. Simple cysts larger than 7 cm require further imaging with\n[MRI](/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging \"Magnetic resonance imaging\") or\nsurgical assessment. Because they are large, they cannot be reliably assessed\nby ultrasound alone because it may be difficult to see the soft tissue\nnodularity or thickened septation at their posterior wall due to limited\npenetrance of the ultrasound beam. For the [corpus luteum](/wiki/Corpus_luteum\n\"Corpus luteum\"), a dominant ovulating follicle that typically appears as a\ncyst with circumferentially thickened walls and [crenulated](/wiki/Crenulation\n\"Crenulation\") inner margins, follow up is not needed if the cyst is less than\n3 cm in diameter. In [postmenopausal](/wiki/Menopause#Diagnosis \"Menopause\")\npatients, any simple cyst greater than 1 cm but less than 7 cm needs yearly\nfollow-up, while those greater than 7 cm need MRI or surgical evaluation,\nsimilar to reproductive age females.[8]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Ovarian_Cyst.JPG/220px-\nOvarian_Cyst.JPG)](/wiki/File:Ovarian_Cyst.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ovarian_Cyst.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn Axial CT demonstrating a large hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. The cyst is\ndelineated by the yellow bars with blood seen anteriorly.\n\nFor incidentally discovered [dermoids](/wiki/Dermoid_cyst \"Dermoid cyst\"),\ndiagnosed on ultrasound by their [pathognomonic](/wiki/Pathognomonic\n\"Pathognomonic\") [echogenic](/wiki/Echogenicity \"Echogenicity\") fat, either\nsurgical removal or yearly follow up is indicated, regardless of patient age.\nFor [peritoneal inclusion cysts](/wiki/Peritoneal_inclusion_cysts \"Peritoneal\ninclusion cysts\"), which have a crumpled tissue-paper appearance and tend to\nfollow the contour of adjacent organs, follow up is based on clinical history.\n[Hydrosalpinx](/wiki/Hydrosalpinx \"Hydrosalpinx\"), or [fallopian\ntube](/wiki/Fallopian_tube \"Fallopian tube\") dilation, can be mistaken for an\novarian cyst due to its anechoic appearance. Follow-up for this is also based\non clinical presentation.[8]\n\nFor multiloculate cysts with thin septation less than 3 mm, surgical\nevaluation is recommended. The presence of multiloculation suggests a\n[neoplasm](/wiki/Neoplasm \"Neoplasm\"), although the thin septation implies\nthat the neoplasm is benign. For any thickened septation, nodularity, or\nvascular flow on [color doppler](/wiki/Color_doppler \"Color doppler\")\nassessment, surgical removal should be considered due to concern for\nmalignancy.[8]\n\n### Scoring\nsystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Scoring systems\")]\n\nThere are several systems to assess risk of an ovarian cyst of being an\n[ovarian cancer](/wiki/Ovarian_cancer \"Ovarian cancer\"), including the RMI\n(risk of malignancy index), LR2 and SR (simple rules). [Sensitivities and\nspecificities](/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity \"Sensitivity and\nspecificity\") of these systems are given in tables below:[9]\n\nScoring systems | Premenopausal | Postmenopausal  \n---|---|---  \nSensitivity | Specificity | Sensitivity | Specificity  \nRMI I | 44% | 95% | 79% | 90%  \nLR2 | 85% | 91% | 94% | 70%  \nSR | 93% | 83% | 93% | 76%  \n  \nOvarian cysts may be classified according to whether they are a variant of the\nnormal [menstrual cycle](/wiki/Menstrual_cycle \"Menstrual cycle\"), referred to\nas a functional or follicular cyst.[4]\n\nOvarian cysts are considered large when they are over 5 cm and giant when they\nare over 15 cm. In children, ovarian cysts reaching above the level of the\numbilicus are considered giant.\n\n### Functional[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Functional\")]\n\nFunctional cysts form as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. There are\nseveral types of cysts:\n\n  * [Follicular cyst](/wiki/Follicular_cyst_of_ovary \"Follicular cyst of ovary\"), the most common type of ovarian cyst. In menstruating women, a follicle containing the [ovum](/wiki/Ovum \"Ovum\"), an unfertilized egg, will rupture during ovulation. If this does not occur, a follicular cyst of more than 2.5 cm diameter may result.[4]\n  * [Corpus luteum cysts](/wiki/Corpus_luteum_cyst \"Corpus luteum cyst\") appear after ovulation. The [corpus luteum](/wiki/Corpus_luteum \"Corpus luteum\") is the remnant of the follicle after the ovum has moved to the [fallopian tubes](/wiki/Fallopian_tube \"Fallopian tube\"). This normally degrades within 5 to 9 days. A corpus luteum that is more than 3 cm is defined as cystic.[4]\n  * [Theca lutein cysts](/wiki/Theca_lutein_cyst \"Theca lutein cyst\") occur within the [thecal layer](/wiki/Ovarian_follicle#Thecal \"Ovarian follicle\") of cells surrounding developing oocytes. Under the influence of excessive [hCG](/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin \"Human chorionic gonadotropin\"), thecal cells may proliferate and become cystic. This is usually on both ovaries.[4]\n\n### Non-\nfunctional[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Non-functional\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Hemorrhagic_ovarian_cyst.jpg/220px-\nHemorrhagic_ovarian_cyst.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hemorrhagic_ovarian_cyst.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hemorrhagic_ovarian_cyst.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Transvaginal ultrasonography](/wiki/Transvaginal_ultrasonography\n\"Transvaginal ultrasonography\") of a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, probably\noriginating from a [corpus luteum cyst](/wiki/Corpus_luteum_cyst \"Corpus\nluteum cyst\").

Ovarian hyperstimulation occurs more often with invasive moles and\nchoriocarcinoma than complete molar pregnancies.[13]\n\n### Risk of\ncancer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Risk of cancer\")]\n\nA widely recognised method of estimating the risk of malignant ovarian cancer\nbased on initial workup is the _risk of malignancy index_ (RMI).[14] It is\nrecommended that women with an RMI score over 200 should be referred to a\ncentre with experience in ovarian cancer surgery.[15]\n\nThe RMI is calculated as follows:[15]\n\n    RMI = ultrasound score x menopausal score x CA-125 level in U/ml.\n\nThere are two methods to determine the ultrasound score and menopausal score,\nwith the resultant RMI being called RMI 1 and RMI 2, respectively, depending\non what method is used:[15]\n\nFeature | RMI 1 | RMI 2  \n---|---|---  \nUltrasound abnormalities:\n\n  * Multilocular cyst\n  * Solid areas\n  * Bilateral lesions\n  * [Ascites](/wiki/Ascites \"Ascites\")\n  * Intra-abdominal metastases\n\n|\n\n  * 0 = no abnormality\n  * 1 = one abnormality\n  * 3 = two or more abnormalities\n\n|\n\n  * 0 = none\n  * 1 = one abnormality\n  * 4 = two or more abnormalities\n\n  \nMenopausal score | \n\n  * 1 = premenopausal\n  * 3 = postmenopausal\n\n|\n\n  * 1 = premenopausal\n  * 4 = postmenopausal\n\n  \nCA-125 | Quantity in U/ml | Quantity in U/ml  \n  \nAn RMI 2 of over 200 has been estimated to have a\n[sensitivity](/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity \"Sensitivity and specificity\")\nof 74 to 80%, a [specificity](/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity \"Sensitivity\nand specificity\") of 89 to 92% and a [positive predictive\nvalue](/wiki/Positive_predictive_value \"Positive predictive value\") of around\n80% of ovarian cancer.[15] RMI 2 is regarded as more sensitive than RMI 1.[15]\n\n## Treatment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Treatment\")]\n\nCysts associated with [hypothyroidism](/wiki/Hypothyroidism \"Hypothyroidism\")\nor other [endocrine](/wiki/Endocrine_system \"Endocrine system\") problems are\nmanaged by treating the underlying condition.\n\nAbout 95% of ovarian cysts are [benign](/wiki/Benign \"Benign\"), not\ncancerous.[16]\n\nFunctional cysts and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts usually resolve\nspontaneously.[17] However, the bigger an ovarian cyst is, the less likely it\nis to disappear on its own.[18] Treatment may be required if cysts persist\nover several months, grow, or cause increasing pain.[19]\n\nCysts that persist beyond two or three [menstrual\ncycles](/wiki/Menstrual_cycle \"Menstrual cycle\"), or occur in\npost-[menopausal](/wiki/Menopausal \"Menopausal\") women, may indicate more\nserious disease and should be investigated through\n[ultrasonography](/wiki/Ultrasonography \"Ultrasonography\") and\n[laparoscopy](/wiki/Laparoscopy \"Laparoscopy\"), especially in cases where\nfamily members have had [ovarian cancer](/wiki/Ovarian_cancer \"Ovarian\ncancer\"). Such cysts may require surgical [biopsy](/wiki/Biopsy \"Biopsy\").\nAdditionally, a [blood test](/wiki/Blood_test \"Blood test\") may be taken\nbefore surgery to check for elevated [CA-125](/wiki/CA-125 \"CA-125\"), a\n[tumour marker](/wiki/Tumour_marker \"Tumour marker\"), which is often found in\nincreased levels in ovarian cancer, although it can also be elevated by other\nconditions resulting in a large number of false positives.[20]\n\n### Pain[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Pain\")]\n\nPain associated with ovarian cysts may be treated in several ways:\n\n  * [Pain relievers](/wiki/Pain_reliever \"Pain reliever\") such as [acetaminophen](/wiki/Acetaminophen \"Acetaminophen\"), [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs \"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\"),[1] or [opioids](/wiki/Opioids \"Opioids\").\n  * While [hormonal birth control](/wiki/Hormonal_birth_control \"Hormonal birth control\") prevents the development of new cysts in those who frequently get them,[1] it is not useful for the treatment of current cysts.[2]\n\n### Surgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Surgery\")]\n\nAlthough most cases of ovarian cysts involve monitoring, some cases require\nsurgery.[21] This may involve removing the cyst, or [one or both\novaries](/wiki/Oopherectomy \"Oopherectomy\").[22] Technique is typically\n[laparoscopic](/wiki/Laparoscopic \"Laparoscopic\"), unless the cyst is\nparticularly large, or if pre-operative imaging suggests malignancy or complex\nanatomy.[23] In certain situations, the cyst is entirely\n[removed](/wiki/Resection_\\(surgery\\) \"Resection \\(surgery\\)\"), while with\ncysts with low recurrence risk, younger patients, or which are in anatomically\neloquent areas of the pelvis, they can be drained.[24][25] Features that may\nindicate the need for surgery include:[26]\n\n  * Persistent complex ovarian cysts\n  * Persistent cysts that are causing symptoms\n  * Complex ovarian cysts larger than 5 cm\n  * Simple ovarian cysts larger 10 cm or larger than 5 cm in postmenopausal patients\n  * Women who are menopausal or [perimenopausal](/wiki/Perimenopausal \"Perimenopausal\")\n\n## Frequency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Frequency\")]\n\nMost women of reproductive age develop small cysts each month, and large cysts\nthat cause problems occur in about 8% of women before\n[menopause](/wiki/Menopause \"Menopause\").[1] Ovarian cysts are present in\nabout 16% of women after menopause and if present are more likely to be\ncancer.[1][3]\n\nBenign ovarian cysts are common in asymptomatic premenarchal girls and found\nin approximately 68% of ovaries of girls 2–12 years old and in 84% of ovaries\nof girls 0–2 years old. Most of them are smaller than 9 mm while about 10-20%\nare larger [macrocysts](/wiki/Macrocyst \"Macrocyst\"). While the smaller cysts\nmostly disappear within 6 months the larger ones appear to be more\npersistent.[27][28]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ovarian_cyst&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ _**h**_ _**i**_ _**j**_ _**k**_ _**l**_ _**m**_ _**n**_ _**o**_ _**p**_ _**q**_ _**r**_ _**s**_ _**t**_ _**u**_ _**v**_ _**w**_ _**x**_ _**y**_ _**z**_ _**aa**_ _**ab**_ _**ac**_ _**ad**_ _**ae**_ [\"Ovarian cysts\"](http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/ovarian-cysts.html?from=AtoZ#). _Office on Women 's Health_.
