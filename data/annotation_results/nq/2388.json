For instance, when an [acid](/wiki/Acid \"Acid\") dissolves\nin water, a [covalent](/wiki/Covalent \"Covalent\") bond between an\n[electronegative](/wiki/Electronegative \"Electronegative\") atom and a hydrogen\natom is broken by [heterolytic fission](/wiki/Heterolytic_fission \"Heterolytic\nfission\"), which gives a proton (H+) and a negative [ion](/wiki/Ion \"Ion\").\nDissociation is the same as **recombination**.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Dissociation constant\n  * 2 Dissociation degree\n  * 3 Salts\n  * 4 Gases\n  * 5 Acids in aqueous solution\n  * 6 Fragmentation\n  * 7 Receptors\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n\n## Dissociation\nconstant[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dissociation_\\(chemistry\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Dissociation constant\")]\n\nMain article: [Dissociation constant](/wiki/Dissociation_constant\n\"Dissociation constant\")\n\nFor reversible dissociations in a [chemical\nequilibrium](/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium \"Chemical equilibrium\")\n\n    AB ⇌ A + B\n\nthe [dissociation constant](/wiki/Dissociation_constant \"Dissociation\nconstant\") _K_ a is the ratio of dissociated to undissociated compound\n\n     K a = [ A ] [ B ] [ A B ] {\\displaystyle K_{a}=\\mathrm {\\frac {[A][B]}{[AB]}} } ![K_{a}={\\\\mathrm  {{\\\\frac  {\\[A\\]\\[B\\]}{\\[AB\\]}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d3dea01bcf342d527a9c6cab93a4459d9c49251)\n\nwhere the brackets denote the equilibrium concentrations of the species.\n\n## Dissociation\ndegree[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dissociation_\\(chemistry\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Dissociation degree\")]\n\nThe dissociation degree is the fraction of original solute molecules that have\ndissociated. It is usually indicated by the Greek symbol α. More accurately,\ndegree of dissociation refers to the amount of solute dissociated into ions or\nradicals per mole. In case of very strong acids and bases, degree of\ndissociation will be close to 1. Less powerful acids and bases will have\nlesser degree of dissociation. There is a simple relationship between this\nparameter and the [van 't Hoff factor](/wiki/Van_%27t_Hoff_factor \"Van 't Hoff\nfactor\") ** i {\\displaystyle i}\n![i](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/add78d8608ad86e54951b8c8bd6c8d8416533d20)**.\nIf the solute substance dissociates into  n {\\displaystyle n}\n![n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)\nions, then\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     i = 1 + α ( n − 1 ) {\\displaystyle i=1+\\alpha (n-1)} ![i=1+\\\\alpha \\(n-1\\)](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6727544fcf66acc52fb8c0d7a05379f9c75656c4)\n\nFor instance, for the following dissociation\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    KCl ⇌ K+ \\+ Cl−\n\nAs  n = 2 {\\displaystyle n=2}\n![n=2](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a02c8bd752d2cc859747ca1f3a508281bdbc3b34),\nwe would have that  i = 1 + α {\\displaystyle i=1+\\alpha } ![i=1+\\\\alpha\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6ed9d5504b79e79be975cad562c582a0588f5774)\n\n##\nSalts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dissociation_\\(chemistry\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Salts\")]\n\nThe dissociation of salts by [solvation](/wiki/Solvation \"Solvation\") in a\n[solution](/wiki/Solution \"Solution\") like [water](/wiki/Water_\\(molecule\\)\n\"Water \\(molecule\\)\") means the separation of the [anions](/wiki/Anion\n\"Anion\") and [cations](/wiki/Cation \"Cation\"). The salt can be recovered by\n[evaporation](/wiki/Evaporation \"Evaporation\") of the solvent. See also:\n[Solubility equilibrium](/wiki/Solubility_equilibrium \"Solubility\nequilibrium\")\n\nAn electrolyte refers to a substance that contains free ions and can be used\nas an electrically conductive medium. Most of the solute does not dissociate\nin a weak electrolyte whereas in a strong electrolyte a higher ratio of solute\ndissociates to form free ions.\n\nA weak electrolyte is a substance whose solute exists in solution mostly in\nthe form of molecules (which are said to be \"undissociated\"), with only a\nsmall fraction in the form of ions. Simply because a substance does not\nreadily dissolve does not make it a weak electrolyte. [Acetic\nacid](/wiki/Acetic_acid \"Acetic acid\") (CH3COOH) and [ammonium](/wiki/Ammonium\n\"Ammonium\") (NH4+) are good examples. Acetic acid is extremely soluble in\nwater, but most of the compound dissolves into molecules, rendering it a weak\nelectrolyte. Weak bases and weak acids are generally weak electrolytes. In an\naqueous solution there will be some CH3COOH and some CH3COO− and H+.\n\nA strong electrolyte is a solute that exists in solution completely or nearly\ncompletely as ions. Again, the strength of an electrolyte is defined as the\npercentage of solute that is ions, rather than molecules. The higher the\npercentage, the stronger the electrolyte. Thus, even if a substance is not\nvery soluble, but does dissociate completely into ions, the substance is\ndefined as a strong electrolyte. Similar logic applies to a weak electrolyte.\nStrong acids and bases are good examples such as HCl, and H2SO4. These will\nall exist as ions in an aqueous medium.\n\n##\nGases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dissociation_\\(chemistry\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Gases\")]\n\nThe degree of dissociation in [gases](/wiki/Gases \"Gases\") is denoted by the\nsymbol α where α refers to the percentage of gas molecules which dissociate.\nVarious relationships between Kp and α exist depending on the stoichiometry of\nthe equation. The example of [dinitrogen tetroxide](/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide\n\"Dinitrogen tetroxide\") (N2O4) dissociating to [nitrogen\ndioxide](/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide \"Nitrogen dioxide\") (NO2) will be taken.\n\n    N2O4 ⇌ 2NO2\n\nIf the initial concentration of dinitrogen tetroxide is 1 mole per litre, this\nwill decrease by α at equilibrium giving, by stoichiometry, 2α moles of NO2.\nThe [equilibrium constant](/wiki/Equilibrium_constant \"Equilibrium constant\")\n(in terms of pressure) is given by the equation;\n\n     K p = p ( NO 2 ) 2 p ( N 2 O 4 ) {\\displaystyle K_{p}={\\frac {\\ce {p(NO2)^{2}}}{\\ce {p(N2O4)}}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle K_{p}={\\\\frac {\\\\ce {p\\(NO2\\)^{2}}}{\\\\ce {p\\(N2O4\\)}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b732347c47c900e2914468095226c6f68cf21a17)\n\nWhere p represents the partial pressure. Hence, through the definition of\n[partial pressure](/wiki/Partial_pressure \"Partial pressure\") and using pT to\nrepresent the total pressure and x to represent the mole fraction;\n\n     K p = p T 2 ( x ( NO 2 ) ) 2 p T ⋅ x ( N 2 O 4 ) = p T ( x ( NO 2 ) ) 2 x ( N 2 O 4 ) {\\displaystyle K_{p}={\\frac {\\ce {{p_{T}}^{2}(x(NO2))^{2}}}{\\ce {p_{T}\\cdot x(N2O4)}}}={\\frac {\\ce {p_{T}(x(NO2))^{2}}}{\\ce {x(N2O4)}}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle K_{p}={\\\\frac {\\\\ce {{p_{T}}^{2}\\(x\\(NO2\\)\\)^{2}}}{\\\\ce {p_{T}\\\\cdot x\\(N2O4\\)}}}={\\\\frac {\\\\ce {p_{T}\\(x\\(NO2\\)\\)^{2}}}{\\\\ce {x\\(N2O4\\)}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44e0362f8f15b36851adb1230b6a76a2f96b7199)\n\nThe total number of moles at equilibrium is (1-α)+(2α) which is equivalent to\n1+α. Thus, substituting the mole fractions with actual values in term of alpha\nand simplifying;\n\n     K p = p T ( 4 α 2 ) ( 1 + α ) ( 1 − α ) = p T ( 4 α 2 ) 1 − α 2 {\\displaystyle K_{p}={\\frac {\\ce {p_{T}(4\\alpha ^{2})}}{(1+\\alpha )(1-\\alpha )}}={\\frac {\\ce {p_{T}(4\\alpha ^{2})}}{1-\\alpha ^{2}}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle K_{p}={\\\\frac {\\\\ce {p_{T}\\(4\\\\alpha ^{2}\\)}}{\\(1+\\\\alpha \\)\\(1-\\\\alpha \\)}}={\\\\frac {\\\\ce {p_{T}\\(4\\\\alpha ^{2}\\)}}{1-\\\\alpha ^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd9c2c22b797bcff02e77696e401ce8ccf37785f)\n\nThis equation is in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle. _K_ p will\nremain constant with temperature. The addition of pressure to the system will\nincrease the value of pT so α must decrease to keep _K_ p constant. In fact,\nincreasing the pressure of the equilibrium favours a shift to the left\nfavouring the formation of dinitrogen tetroxide (as on this side of the\nequilibrium there is less pressure since pressure is proportional to number of\nmoles) hence decreasing the extent of dissociation α.\n\n## Acids in aqueous\nsolution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dissociation_\\(chemistry\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Acids in aqueous solution\")]\n\nMain article: [acid dissociation constant](/wiki/Acid_dissociation_constant\n\"Acid dissociation constant\")\n\nThe reaction of an acid in water solvent is often described as a dissociation\n\n     HA ↽ − − ⇀ H + + A − {\\displaystyle {\\ce {HA<=>{H+}+{A^{-}}}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {HA<=>{H+}+{A^{-}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65573ef6d3a23b3c4e436a74387bbf87d4f0e554)\n\nwhere HA is a proton acid such as acetic acid, CH3COOH. The double arrow means\nthat this is an equilibrium process, with dissociation and recombination\noccurring at the same time.
