The Red Hot\nChilli Pipers perform a fusion of traditional pipe tunes and contemporary\npieces. Notable covers performed have included \"[We Will Rock\nYou](/wiki/We_Will_Rock_You \"We Will Rock You\")\" by\n[Queen](/wiki/Queen_\\(band\\) \"Queen \\(band\\)\"),\n\"[Clocks](/wiki/Clocks_\\(song\\) \"Clocks \\(song\\)\")\" by\n[Coldplay](/wiki/Coldplay \"Coldplay\") and \"[Smoke on the\nWater](/wiki/Smoke_on_the_Water \"Smoke on the Water\")\" by [Deep\nPurple](/wiki/Deep_Purple \"Deep Purple\") as well as \"[Chasing\nCars](/wiki/Chasing_Cars \"Chasing Cars\")\" by [Snow Patrol](/wiki/Snow_Patrol\n\"Snow Patrol\"), \"[Don't Stop Believing](/wiki/Don%27t_Stop_Believing \"Don't\nStop Believing\")\" by [Journey](/wiki/Journey_\\(band\\) \"Journey \\(band\\)\").\nTheir biggest hit to date is of course the platinum selling and award winning\nJazz Badger.\n\nThe band has released 6 studio albums as of 2016, of which their first, their\n2005 release _The Red Hot Chilli Pipers_ , was the least successful. Their\n2007 album _Bagrock to the Masses_ went platinum in Scotland and silver in\nGreat Britain. Their third album and first live album, _Blast Live_ (2008),\nwent triple platinum in Scotland. Their fourth release _Music for the Kilted\nGeneration_ , however, is The Red Hot Chilli Pipers' best International\nrecord, reaching Number 2 on the US Amazon Chart.[4] and was only held off of\nthe top spot due to [Adele](/wiki/Adele \"Adele\")'s record-breaking album,\n_[21](/wiki/21_\\(Adele_album\\) \"21 \\(Adele album\\)\")_.\n\nTheir album titled _Music for the Kilted Generation_ , is a parody of _[Music\nfor the Jilted Generation](/wiki/Music_for_the_Jilted_Generation \"Music for\nthe Jilted Generation\")_ by [The Prodigy](/wiki/The_Prodigy \"The Prodigy\").\n\nThe band signed a contract in December 2012 for a new album to be released in\n2013, including tracks from bands like Coldplay and\n[Journey](/wiki/Journey_\\(band\\) \"Journey \\(band\\)\"). _Breathe_ was released\nin July 2013 on CD and [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\").\n\nThe group appears on the soundtrack of _[How to Train Your Dragon\n2](/wiki/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_2 \"How to Train Your Dragon 2\")._[5]\n\n##\nDiscography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Discography\")]\n\n  * 2005 – _The Red Hot Chilli Pipers_\n  * 2007 – _Bagrock to the Masses_\n  * 2008 – _Blast Live_\n  * 2010 – _Music for the Kilted Generation_\n  * 2012 – _Braveheart_\n  * 2013 – _Breathe_\n  * 2014 – _Live at the Lake 2014_\n  * 2016 – _Octane_[6]\n\n## Tours and\nperformances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Tours and performances\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Koblenz_im_Buga-\nJahr_2011_-_Er%C3%B6ffnung_Kultursommer_Rheinland-Pfalz_1.jpg/220px-\nKoblenz_im_Buga-Jahr_2011_-_Er%C3%B6ffnung_Kultursommer_Rheinland-\nPfalz_1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Koblenz_im_Buga-\nJahr_2011_-_Er%C3%B6ffnung_Kultursommer_Rheinland-Pfalz_1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Koblenz_im_Buga-\nJahr_2011_-_Er%C3%B6ffnung_Kultursommer_Rheinland-Pfalz_1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRed Hot Chilli Pipers in [Koblenz](/wiki/Koblenz \"Koblenz\") 2011\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers_-\n_Wacken_Open_Air_2016-AL0389.jpg/220px-Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers_-\n_Wacken_Open_Air_2016-AL0389.jpg)](/wiki/File:Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers_-\n_Wacken_Open_Air_2016-AL0389.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers_-_Wacken_Open_Air_2016-AL0389.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nRed Hot Chilli Pipers - [Wacken Open Air](/wiki/Wacken_Open_Air \"Wacken Open\nAir\") 2016\n\nThe group's highest profile performance's have been on the Main Stage at [T in\nthe Park](/wiki/T_in_the_Park \"T in the Park\") in 2004 where they performed\nalongside The Darkness, and in 2014 when they performed on the Main Stage\nagain in their own right.\n\n### When Will I Be\nFamous[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: When Will I Be Famous\")]\n\nIn 2007, the Red Hot Chilli Pipers appeared on the BBC show _When Will I be\nFamous?_[7] hosted by [Graham Norton](/wiki/Graham_Norton \"Graham Norton\").\nThe band were in the episode and competed against seven others.

The Red Hot Chilli\nPipers won the head-to-head 51-50 and went on to win the weekly prize of ten\nthousand pounds.\n\n### After TV\nappearance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: After TV appearance\")]\n\nIn 2010, The Red Hot Chilli Pipers completed an 11-date sold-out tour of\n[Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\"), as well as an 11-week tour of Germany\nand a 7-week tour of [America](/wiki/United_States \"United States\").

Founder and Former\nMusical Director Cassells received 'BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional\nMusician of the Year' in 2005 and became the first person ever to attain a\ndegree in bagpipes[8] from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (Formerly the\nRoyal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama). The snare drummer and\npercussionist, Grant Cassidy is an 8 time Juvenile Solo World Drumming\nChampion and in 2016 placed 7th in the adult section of the World Solo\nDrumming Championships held in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n## Former\nmembers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Former members\")]\n\nOn 23 September 2011, founder and [frontman](/wiki/Frontman \"Frontman\") Stuart\nCassells, left the band. Stuart decided that, after almost ten years, it was\ntime to pursue new goals and opportunities. Cassells said, \"I have had some\nabsolutely amazing times in the band and I would never have imagined the\nsuccess we’ve had. I want to thank all the great musicians I’ve had the\npleasure of performing with and I’m excited about the new chapter in my life\".\nPrior to leaving, Stuart had been struggling with '[focal hand\ndystonia'](/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience_of_music#Focal_hand_dystonia\n\"Cognitive neuroscience of music\"), more commonly known as [writer's\ncramp](/wiki/Writer%27s_cramp \"Writer's cramp\") since 2008. Speaking to _[The\nDaily Record](/wiki/Daily_Record_\\(Scotland\\) \"Daily Record \\(Scotland\\)\")_ on\nthe subject, Cassells said, \"My left hand refused to stay on the chanter. It\nwas like my left hand wasn't my own, it wouldn't stay still, like someone else\nwas controlling it. I knew in my head how I wanted to play but I couldn't\nbecause my hands would curl right up and tense up and move involuntarily. They\nweren't doing what they were supposed to do. The brain was sending far too\nmany signals to my hands.\" Stuart tried various treatments throughout this\nperiod, including surgery to release a trapped nerve,\n[physiotherapy](/wiki/Physiotherapy \"Physiotherapy\") and [botox](/wiki/Botox\n\"Botox\") injections into his arm to relax the muscles. In efforts to help him\nplay the bagpipes, he had [McCallum Bagpipes](/wiki/McCallum_Bagpipes\n\"McCallum Bagpipes\") manufacture him a custom chanter that uses flute keys to\ncover the holes instead of requiring the player to cover them. However, he was\nstill unable to play them and left the band. It is hoped that he will recover\nand rejoin the band. A recent World Pipe Band Championship winner with the\nField Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band, Kyle Warren, replaced him.[9][10]\n\n## Awards and\nnominations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Awards and nominations\")]\n\n### Scottish Live Act of the\nYear[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Scottish Live Act of the Year\")]\n\nYear  | Nominee/work  | Award  | Result   \n---|---|---|---  \n2007 | Red Hot Chilli Pipers | Scottish Live Act of the Year | Won   \n2010 | Red Hot Chilli Pipers | Scottish Live Act of the Year | Won   \n  \n### BBC's 'When Will I Be\nFamous'[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: BBC's 'When Will I Be Famous'\")]\n\n  * Winners 2007\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Hot_Chilli_Pipers&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Gavin Cumine (31 May 2008), [\"Bagrock with the Red Hot Chilli Pipers: it's a total blast\"](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4026407.ece), _[The Times](/wiki/The_Times \"The Times\")_\n  2. **Jump up ^** James, Greg (9 July 2013).
