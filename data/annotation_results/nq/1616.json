He occasionally tours with a full band.[2]\n\nBeam was raised in [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\")\nbefore moving to [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\") and then\n[Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\") to attend school. He now resides in\n[Durham, North Carolina](/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina \"Durham, North\nCarolina\").[3] The name _Iron & Wine_ is taken from a dietary supplement named\n\"Beef, Iron & Wine\" that he found in a general store while shooting a film.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Early life\n  * 2 Musical career\n  * 3 Personal life\n  * 4 Discography\n    * 4.1 Albums\n    * 4.2 EPs\n    * 4.3 Singles\n    * 4.4 Other contributions\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Early\nlife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Iron_%26_Wine&action=edit&section=1&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Early life\")]\n\nBeam was raised in [Chapin, South Carolina](/wiki/Chapin,_South_Carolina\n\"Chapin, South Carolina\"), where his father worked in land management and his\nmother was a schoolteacher. When he was a child, his family took regular trips\nto the country, where his grandfather ran a farm. He attended Seven Oaks\nElementary School, Chapin Middle School, and Chapin High School. While home\nfrom college, he was a waiter at California Dreaming restaurant in Columbia.\nBeam earned a bachelor's degree in art from [Virginia Commonwealth\nUniversity](/wiki/Virginia_Commonwealth_University \"Virginia Commonwealth\nUniversity\") in [Richmond, Virginia](/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia \"Richmond,\nVirginia\"). He specialized in painting before graduating from the [Florida\nState University Film School](/wiki/Florida_State_University_Film_School\n\"Florida State University Film School\") with an\n[MFA](/wiki/Master_of_Fine_Arts \"Master of Fine Arts\") degree. Before the\nrelease of the first Iron & Wine album, Beam's main source of income was as a\nprofessor of film and cinematography at the [University of\nMiami](/wiki/University_of_Miami \"University of Miami\") and [Miami\nInternational University of Art &\nDesign](/wiki/Miami_International_University_of_Art_%26_Design \"Miami\nInternational University of Art & Design\").[5] He had been writing songs for\nover seven years before a friend lent him a four-track recorder. He began\nmaking demos and gave one to his friend Michael Bridwell, brother of [Band of\nHorses](/wiki/Band_of_Horses \"Band of Horses\") lead singer, [Ben\nBridwell](/wiki/Ben_Bridwell \"Ben Bridwell\"). Michael handed it to Mike\nMcGonigal, editor of [Yeti magazine](/wiki/Yeti_\\(magazine\\) \"Yeti\n\\(magazine\\)\"), who chose \"Dead Man's Will\", later released on _[In the\nReins](/wiki/In_the_Reins \"In the Reins\")_ , for inclusion on one of his\nmagazine's compilation CDs. Beam later came to the attention of [Sub Pop\nRecords](/wiki/Sub_Pop \"Sub Pop\") co-owner, Jonathan Poneman, who contacted\nBeam to propose a deal.[6][7][8][9]\n\n## Musical\ncareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Iron_%26_Wine&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Musical career\")]\n\nBeam released his first Iron & Wine album, _[The Creek Drank the\nCradle](/wiki/The_Creek_Drank_the_Cradle \"The Creek Drank the Cradle\")_ , on\nthe Sub Pop label in 2002. Beam wrote, performed, recorded and\n[produced](/wiki/Record_producer \"Record producer\") the album in his home\nstudio. Featuring [acoustic guitars](/wiki/Acoustic_guitar \"Acoustic guitar\"),\n[banjo](/wiki/Banjo \"Banjo\"), and [slide guitar](/wiki/Slide_guitar \"Slide\nguitar\"), the album's music has been compared to that of [Nick\nDrake](/wiki/Nick_Drake \"Nick Drake\"),[10] [Simon and\nGarfunkel](/wiki/Simon_and_Garfunkel \"Simon and Garfunkel\"),[11] [Elliott\nSmith](/wiki/Elliott_Smith \"Elliott Smith\"), [Neil Young](/wiki/Neil_Young\n\"Neil Young\") and [John Fahey](/wiki/John_Fahey_\\(musician\\) \"John Fahey\n\\(musician\\)\").\n\nAlso in 2002, Beam recorded a [cover](/wiki/Cover_version \"Cover version\") of\n[The Postal Service](/wiki/The_Postal_Service \"The Postal Service\")'s then-\nunreleased song \"[Such Great Heights](/wiki/Such_Great_Heights \"Such Great\nHeights\")\". Rather than being included on an Iron & Wine release, the track\nwas initially included as a [b-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and\nB-side\") of the original version by The Postal Service. It was later included\non the B-sides and rarities album, _[Around the Well](/wiki/Around_the_Well\n\"Around the Well\")_. He then followed up on his debut album in 2003 with _[The\nSea& The Rhythm](/wiki/The_Sea_%26_The_Rhythm \"The Sea & The Rhythm\")_, an EP\ncontaining other home-recorded tracks with a similar style to the songs on the\ndebut.\n\nBeam's second full-length album, _[Our Endless Numbered\nDays](/wiki/Our_Endless_Numbered_Days \"Our Endless Numbered Days\")_ (2004),\nwas recorded in a professional studio with a significant increase in fidelity.\nProduced in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\") by [Brian\nDeck](/wiki/Brian_Deck \"Brian Deck\"), the focus was still on acoustic\nmaterial, but the inclusion of other band members gave rise to a slightly\ndifferent sound. That same year, he recorded the song \"The Trapeze Swinger\"\nfor the film _[In Good Company](/wiki/In_Good_Company_\\(2004_film\\) \"In Good\nCompany \\(2004 film\\)\")_ , and had his version of \"Such Great Heights\"\nfeatured in an advertisement for [M&M's](/wiki/M%26M%27s \"M&M's\") and in the\nfilm and soundtrack for _[Garden State](/wiki/Garden_State_\\(film\\) \"Garden\nState \\(film\\)\")_. This version was later used in a 2006\n[Ask.com](/wiki/Ask.com \"Ask.com\") advertisement, and eventually released as a\nsingle in 2006 backed with recordings of \"The Trapeze Swinger\" and \"Naked as\nWe Came\" made for Radio Vienna.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/95/Sarahbeam.JPG/170px-\nSarahbeam.JPG)](/wiki/File:Sarahbeam.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sarahbeam.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nSarah Beam, Samuel's sister, at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland\n\nIn February 2005, he released an EP entitled _[Woman King](/wiki/Woman_King\n\"Woman King\")_ , which expanded on the sounds of his previous LP with the\naddition of [electric guitars](/wiki/Electric_guitar \"Electric guitar\"). Each\ntrack features a spiritual female figure, and had subtle\n[Biblical](/wiki/Bible \"Bible\") undertones.\n\nThe EP _[In the Reins](/wiki/In_the_Reins \"In the Reins\")_ , a collaboration\nwith the Arizona-based rock band [Calexico](/wiki/Calexico_\\(band\\) \"Calexico\n\\(band\\)\"), was released in September 2005. Beam wrote all of the EP's songs\nyears earlier, but Calexico added their trademark fusion of\n[southwestern](/wiki/Southwestern_United_States \"Southwestern United States\")\nrock, traditional [Mexican](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\") music and [jazz](/wiki/Jazz\n\"Jazz\") to the songs' arrangements. Several tracks, most notably, \"Burn That\nBroken Bed\", feature brass instruments, a first for Beam's music.[12]\n\nThe third full-length Iron & Wine album, entitled _[The Shepherd's\nDog](/wiki/The_Shepherd%27s_Dog \"The Shepherd's Dog\")_, was released September\n25, 2007.[13] This album was voted one of the ten best of 2007 by\n_[Paste](/wiki/Paste_\\(magazine\\) \"Paste \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine.[14]\nContributors included Joey Burns and Paul Niehaus of\n[Calexico](/wiki/Calexico_\\(band\\) \"Calexico \\(band\\)\"), as well as jazz\nmusicians Matt Lux and [Rob Burger](/wiki/Rob_Burger \"Rob Burger\").[15] When\nasked to describe the album to _The Independent_ , Beam remarked that \"it's\nnot a political propaganda record, but it's definitely inspired by political\nconfusion, because I was really taken aback when [Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush\n\"George W. Bush\") got reelected.\"[16]\n\nBeam has released most of his music on [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\"),\nincluding several exclusive EPs. The _[Iron& Wine iTunes Exclusive\nEP](/wiki/Iron_%26_Wine_iTunes_Exclusive_EP \"Iron & Wine iTunes Exclusive\nEP\")_ features unreleased studio recordings, including a\n[Stereolab](/wiki/Stereolab \"Stereolab\") cover and two tracks which had\npreviously only appeared on [vinyl](/wiki/Gramophone_record \"Gramophone\nrecord\"). The _Live Session (iTunes Exclusive)_ features Beam and his sister,\nSarah Beam, performing a number of tracks from his albums, as well as a cover\nof [New Order](/wiki/New_Order_\\(band\\) \"New Order \\(band\\)\")'s \"[Love\nVigilantes](/wiki/Love_Vigilantes \"Love Vigilantes\")\". Sarah Beam has\ncontributed backing vocals on many of Beam's studio recordings.\n\nBeam's music has appeared in television series such as _[Grey's\nAnatomy](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy \"Grey's Anatomy\")_, _[The L\nWord](/wiki/The_L_Word \"The L Word\")_ and _[House\nM.D.](/wiki/House_\\(TV_series\\) \"House \\(TV series\\)\")_ \"Flightless Bird,\nAmerican Mouth\" was used in the film _[Twilight](/wiki/Twilight_\\(2008_film\\)\n\"Twilight \\(2008 film\\)\")_. The song was specifically chosen for the film's\nprom scene by [Kristen Stewart](/wiki/Kristen_Stewart \"Kristen Stewart\"), the\nfemale lead, and appears on the [film's\nsoundtrack](/wiki/Twilight_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Twilight \\(soundtrack\\)\").\n\nThe B-sides and rarities album _[Around the Well](/wiki/Around_the_Well\n\"Around the Well\")_ was released in 2009. Iron & Wine also contributed the\nsong \"Stolen Houses (Die)\" to the AIDS benefit album _[Dark Was the\nNight](/wiki/Dark_Was_the_Night \"Dark Was the Night\")_ produced by the [Red\nHot Organization](/wiki/Red_Hot_Organization \"Red Hot Organization\").\n\nOn November 26, 2010 Iron & Wine released a special edition _Record Store Day\nBlack Friday_ 12\" vinyl and CD single called, _Walking Far From Home_ for\nindependent record stores.\n\n_[Kiss Each Other Clean](/wiki/Kiss_Each_Other_Clean \"Kiss Each Other Clean\")_\n, Iron & Wine's fourth full-length album, was released on January 25, 2011 on\n[Warner Bros. Records](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records \"Warner Bros. Records\") in\nNorth America and [4AD](/wiki/4AD \"4AD\") for the rest of the world.[17] With\nthis album, Beam blended his earlier styles with a stronger pop influence.[18]\n\n_[Ghost on Ghost](/wiki/Ghost_on_Ghost \"Ghost on Ghost\")_ , Iron & Wine's\nfifth studio album, was released in April 2013 on [Nonesuch\nRecords](/wiki/Nonesuch_Records \"Nonesuch Records\") in North America and\n[4AD](/wiki/4AD \"4AD\") for the rest of the world.[19] _Ghost on Ghost_ marked\na further exploration into the pop sounds of _Kiss Each Other Clean_ while\nalso exhibiting jazz and R&B influences, with jazz drummer [Brian\nBlade](/wiki/Brian_Blade \"Brian Blade\") contributing to the album.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\nJanuary 2014, recording during the polar vortex in Chicago, Beam and his\nregular collaborator Brian Deck co-produced eight of the ten songs on\n[Chadwick Stokes](/wiki/Chadwick_Stokes_Urmston \"Chadwick Stokes Urmston\")'\n2015 album _The Horse Comanche_.[20] Beam contributed the Iron & Wine band to\nthe sessions and sang backing vocals.\n\nIron & Wine released two albums in 2015. _Archive Series: Volume 1_ , released\nin February, featured unreleased songs recorded during the same period as _The\nCreek Drank the Cradle_. Covers album, _[Sing Into My\nMouth](/wiki/Sing_Into_My_Mouth \"Sing Into My Mouth\")_ , recorded with [Band\nof Horses](/wiki/Band_of_Horses \"Band of Horses\") singer [Ben\nBridwell](/wiki/Ben_Bridwell \"Ben Bridwell\"), was released in July.[21] _[Love\nLetter for Fire](/wiki/Love_Letter_for_Fire \"Love Letter for Fire\")_ , an\nalbum of duets with American singer-songwriter [Jesca Hoop](/wiki/Jesca_Hoop\n\"Jesca Hoop\"), was released in 2016 on Sub Pop.

[22]\n\nIn August 2017, Iron & Wine's sixth studio album [Beast\nEpic](/wiki/Beast_Epic_\\(album\\) \"Beast Epic \\(album\\)\") was released through\n[Sub Pop](/wiki/Sub_Pop \"Sub Pop\") Records. The record saw Beam strip back the\nproduction and array of instruments from previous records to return to more\nsimple and melodic song structures.[23]\n\n## Personal\nlife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Iron_%26_Wine&action=edit&section=3&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Personal life\")]\n\nBeam, his wife Kim, and their five daughters live in [Durham, North\nCarolina](/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina \"Durham, North Carolina\").[24] He was\nraised in the [Bible belt](/wiki/Bible_belt \"Bible belt\") as a Christian, but\nis now an [agnostic](/wiki/Agnosticism \"Agnosticism\"): \"That was a confusing\ntime for me, but I don't miss being misled. I'm not an atheist. There's an\nundeniable unseen world that some people call God and think they know more\nabout than other people. I try not to get hung up on the names.\"[25][26]\n\nIn 2011, a portrait of Beam was painted by British artist [Joe\nSimpson](/wiki/Joe_Simpson_\\(artist\\) \"Joe Simpson \\(artist\\)\").
