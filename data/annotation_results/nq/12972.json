When they were unused, Andy was 17 years old.\n\nIn the two sequels, the song is listened to by the characters as part of the\nstory. Two of these are cover versions done at the end of the film for\nthematic reasons: at the end of _Toy Story 2_ , the character Wheezy starts to\nsing it to the other toys; during the end credits of _Toy Story 3_ , Buzz\nLightyear and Jessie (now a couple) perform a [pasodoble](/wiki/Pasodoble\n\"Pasodoble\") to a Spanish version of the song, deliberately played by Jessie\nto get Buzz to dance.\n\nThe most significant use of the song was in the third act of _Toy Story 2_ ,\nwhere an episode of _Woody 's Roundup_ (the 1950s puppet show he was based on)\nshows the puppet Woody singing the song, directed at the young audience and\nfeaturing a small child hugging the puppet. Woody sees this and has an\n[epiphany](/wiki/Epiphany_\\(feeling\\) \"Epiphany \\(feeling\\)\"), realizing that\nhis mission as a toy is to be there for a child. (In-universe, the song was\npresumably written for _Woody 's Roundup_.)\n\nThe _Woody 's Roundup_ version was performed by [Tom Hanks](/wiki/Tom_Hanks\n\"Tom Hanks\"), with acoustic guitar backing; Wheezy's version was sung by\n[Robert Goulet](/wiki/Robert_Goulet \"Robert Goulet\") (though the character was\nvoiced by [Joe Ranft](/wiki/Joe_Ranft \"Joe Ranft\")); and the Spanish version,\n\"You've Got a Friend in Me (Para el Buzz Español)\", was performed by the\n[Gipsy Kings](/wiki/Gipsy_Kings \"Gipsy Kings\").\n\n## Release\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27ve_Got_a_Friend_in_Me&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Release history\")]\n\nFormat | Release date | Catalog  \n---|---|---  \nDemo | Unreleased | none  \nCassette | April 12, 1996[1] | #60367  \nCD  \n  \n## Cover\nversions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27ve_Got_a_Friend_in_Me&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Cover versions\")]\n\n[Michael Bublé](/wiki/Michael_Bubl%C3%A9 \"Michael Bublé\") covered \"You've Got\na Friend in Me\" on his 2013 album, _[To Be Loved](/wiki/To_Be_Loved \"To Be\nLoved\")_.
