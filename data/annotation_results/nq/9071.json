The city was built on the [Euphrates](/wiki/Euphrates \"Euphrates\") river\nand divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep\nembankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a\nsmall [Akkadian](/wiki/Akkadian \"Akkadian\") town dating from the period of the\n[Akkadian Empire](/wiki/Akkadian_Empire \"Akkadian Empire\") c. 2300 BC.\n\nThe town became part of a small independent [city-state](/wiki/City-state\n\"City-state\") with the rise of the First [Amorite](/wiki/Amorite \"Amorite\")\nBabylonian Dynasty in the nineteenth century BC. After the Amorite king\n[Hammurabi](/wiki/Hammurabi \"Hammurabi\") created a short-lived empire in the\n18th century BC, he built Babylon up into a major city and declared himself\nits king, and southern Mesopotamia became known as [Babylonia](/wiki/Babylonia\n\"Babylonia\") and Babylon eclipsed [Nippur](/wiki/Nippur \"Nippur\") as its holy\ncity. The empire waned under Hammurabi's son [Samsu-iluna](/wiki/Samsu-iluna\n\"Samsu-iluna\") and Babylon spent long periods under\n[Assyrian](/wiki/Assyrian_people \"Assyrian people\"), [Kassite](/wiki/Kassites\n\"Kassites\") and [Elamite](/wiki/Elam \"Elam\") domination. After being destroyed\nand then rebuilt by the Assyrians, Babylon became the capital of the short\nlived [Neo-Babylonian Empire](/wiki/Neo-Babylonian_Empire \"Neo-Babylonian\nEmpire\") from 609 to 539 BC. The [Hanging Gardens of\nBabylon](/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon \"Hanging Gardens of Babylon\") was\none of the [Seven Wonders of the Ancient\nWorld](/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World \"Seven Wonders of the Ancient\nWorld\"), although a number of scholars believe these were actually in the\nAssyrian capital of [Nineveh](/wiki/Nineveh \"Nineveh\"). After the fall of the\nNeo-Babylonian Empire, the city came under the rule of the\n[Achaemenid](/wiki/Achaemenid \"Achaemenid\"), [Seleucid](/wiki/Seleucid_Empire\n\"Seleucid Empire\"), [Parthian](/wiki/Parthian_Empire \"Parthian Empire\"),\n[Roman](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman Empire\"), and\n[Sassanid](/wiki/Sasanian_Empire \"Sasanian Empire\") empires.\n\nIt has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world from c.\n1770 – c. 1670 BC, and again between c. 612 – c. 320 BC. It was perhaps the\nfirst city to reach a population above 200,000.[2] Estimates for the maximum\nextent of its area range from 890[3] to 900 hectares (2,200 acres).[4]\n\nThe remains of the city are in present-day [Hillah](/wiki/Hillah \"Hillah\"),\n[Babil Governorate](/wiki/Babil_Governorate \"Babil Governorate\"),\n[Iraq](/wiki/Iraq \"Iraq\"), about 85 kilometres (53 mi) south of\n[Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\"), comprising a large\n[tell](/wiki/Tell_\\(archaeology\\) \"Tell \\(archaeology\\)\") of broken mud-brick\nbuildings and debris.\n\nThe main sources of information about Babylon—excavation of the site itself,\nreferences in [cuneiform](/wiki/Cuneiform \"Cuneiform\") texts found elsewhere\nin Mesopotamia, references in the [Bible](/wiki/Bible \"Bible\"), descriptions\nin classical writing (especially by [Herodotus](/wiki/Herodotus \"Herodotus\")),\nand second-hand descriptions (citing the work of [Ctesias](/wiki/Ctesias\n\"Ctesias\") and [Berossus](/wiki/Berossus \"Berossus\"))—present an incomplete\nand sometimes contradictory picture of the ancient city even at its peak in\nthe sixth century BC.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Name\n  * 2 Geography\n  * 3 Sources\n    * 3.1 Early references\n    * 3.2 Classical dating\n  * 4 History\n    * 4.1 Old Babylonian period\n    * 4.2 Middle Babylon\n    * 4.3 Assyrian period\n    * 4.4 Neo-Babylonian Empire\n    * 4.5 Persian conquest\n    * 4.6 Hellenistic period\n    * 4.7 Renewed Persian rule\n    * 4.8 Muslim conquest\n  * 5 Modern era\n    * 5.1 Excavation and research\n    * 5.2 Iraq government\n    * 5.3 US and Polish occupation\n    * 5.4 Present day\n  * 6 Cultural importance\n    * 6.1 Biblical narrative\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 References\n    * 9.1 Sources\n    * 9.2 Further reading\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Name[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Babylon&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section:\nName\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg/40px-Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png) | Look up _**[𒆍𒀭𒊏𒆠](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%92%86%8D%F0%92%80%AD%F0%92%8A%8F%F0%92%86%A0 \"wiktionary:𒆍𒀭𒊏𒆠\")**_ in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe English _Babylon_ comes from [Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek \"Ancient Greek\")\n_Babylṓn_\n([Βαβυλών](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%92%CE%B1%CE%B2%CF%85%CE%BB%CF%8E%CE%BD\n\"wikt:Βαβυλών\")), a transliteration of the [Akkadian](/wiki/Akkadian_language\n\"Akkadian language\") _Bābilim_.[6][_[not in citation\ngiven](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\n[Archibald Sayce](/wiki/Archibald_Sayce \"Archibald Sayce\"), writing in the\n1870s, considered \"Bab-ilu\" or \"Bab-ili\" to be the translation of an earlier\n[Sumerian](/wiki/Sumerian_language \"Sumerian language\") (formerly thought to\nbe in the obsolete \"[Turanian](/wiki/Turanian_languages \"Turanian languages\")\"\nlanguage-family) name \"Ca-dimirra\", meaning \"gate of god\",[7][8] based on the\ncharacters KAN4 DIĜIR.RAKI (corresponding to the Sumerian phrase _kan diĝirak_\n\"god's gate\") or perhaps based on other characters.[9]\n\nAccording to Professor [Dietz-Otto Edzard](/wiki/Dietz-Otto_Edzard \"Dietz-Otto\nEdzard\"), the city was originally called _Babilla_ , but by the time of the\n[Third Dynasty of Ur](/wiki/Third_Dynasty_of_Ur \"Third Dynasty of Ur\"),\nthrough a process of etymological speculation, had become _Bāb-ili(m)_ meaning\n\"gate of god\" or \"god's gate\"[10] (Bab-[Il](/wiki/El_\\(deity\\) \"El\n\\(deity\\)\")). The \"gate of god\" translation is increasingly viewed as a [folk\netymology](/wiki/Folk_etymology \"Folk etymology\") to explain an unknown\noriginal non-Semitic placename.[11] Linguist [I.J. Gelb](/wiki/Ignace_Gelb\n\"Ignace Gelb\") suggested in 1955 that _Babil/Babilla_ is the basis of the city\nname, of unknown meaning and origin, as there were other similarly-named\nplaces in Sumer, and there are no other examples of Sumerian place-names being\nreplaced with Akkadian translations. He deduced that it later transformed into\nAkkadian _Bāb-ili(m)_ , and that the Sumerian _Ka-dingirra_ was a later\ntranslation of that, rather than vice-versa.[12][13] [Joan\nOates](/wiki/Joan_Oates \"Joan Oates\") states in her book _Babylon_ that the\nrendering _Gateway of the gods_ is no longer accepted by modern\nscholars.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn the [Bible](/wiki/Bible \"Bible\"), the name appears as _Babel_\n([Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\"):\n[בָּבֶל](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%91%D7%9C \"wikt:בבל\")‎,\n_Bavel_ , [Tib.](/wiki/Tiberian_vocalization \"Tiberian vocalization\") בָּבֶל,\n_Bāvel_ ; [Classical Syriac](/wiki/Classical_Syriac_language \"Classical Syriac\nlanguage\"): ܒܒܠ‎, _Bāwēl_), interpreted in the [Hebrew\nScriptures](/wiki/Hebrew_Scriptures \"Hebrew Scriptures\")' [Book of\nGenesis](/wiki/Book_of_Genesis \"Book of Genesis\") to mean\n\"[confusion](/wiki/Confusion_of_tongues \"Confusion of tongues\")\",[14] from the\nverb _bilbél_ ([בלבל](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%9C\n\"wikt:בלבל\"), \"to confuse\").[15] The modern English verb, to \"babble\", or to\nspeak meaningless words, is popularly thought to derive from this name, but\nthere is no direct connection.[16]\n\nAncient records in some situations use Babylon as a name for other cities,\nincluding cities like [Borsippa](/wiki/Borsippa \"Borsippa\") within Babylon's\nsphere of influence, and [Nineveh](/wiki/Nineveh \"Nineveh\") for a short period\nafter the Assyrian sack of Babylon.[17][18]\n\n## Geography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Babylon&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Geography\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Babylone_site_fr.png/220px-\nBabylone_site_fr.png)](/wiki/File:Babylone_site_fr.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Babylone_site_fr.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSchematic showing Babylon on the Euphrates River with major areas within inner\nand outer walls.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Babylon%2C_1932.jpg/220px-\nBabylon%2C_1932.jpg)](/wiki/File:Babylon,_1932.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Babylon,_1932.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBabylon in 1932\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Ancient_Remains_in_Babylon.jpg/220px-\nAncient_Remains_in_Babylon.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ancient_Remains_in_Babylon.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ancient_Remains_in_Babylon.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBrick structures in Babylon, photographed in 2016\n\nThe remains of the city are in present-day [Hillah](/wiki/Hillah \"Hillah\"),[8]\n[Babil Governorate](/wiki/Babil_Governorate \"Babil Governorate\"),\n[Iraq](/wiki/Iraq \"Iraq\"), about 85 kilometers (53 mi) south of\n[Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\"), comprising a large\n[tell](/wiki/Tell_\\(archaeology\\) \"Tell \\(archaeology\\)\") of broken mud-brick\nbuildings and debris. The site at Babylon consists of a number of mounds\ncovering an area of about 2 by 1 kilometer (1.24 mi × 0.62 mi), oriented north\nto south,[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] along the [Euphrates](/wiki/Euphrates\n\"Euphrates\") to the west. Originally, the river roughly bisected the city, but\nthe course of the river has since shifted so that most of the remains of the\nformer western part of the city are now inundated. Some portions of the city\nwall to the west of the river also remain.\n\nOnly a small portion of the ancient city (3% of the area within the inner\nwalls; 1.5% of the area within the outer walls; 0.05% at the depth of Middle\nand Old Babylon) has been excavated.[19] Known remains include:\n\n  * Kasr—also called Palace or Castle, it is the location of the [Neo-Babylonian](/wiki/Neo-Babylonian \"Neo-Babylonian\") ziggurat [Etemenanki](/wiki/Etemenanki \"Etemenanki\") and lies in the center of the site.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n  * Amran Ibn Ali—the highest of the mounds at 25 meters, to the south.

The water table in the region has risen greatly over the centuries and\nartifacts from the time before the [Neo-Babylonian Empire](/wiki/Neo-\nBabylonian_Empire \"Neo-Babylonian Empire\") are unavailable to current standard\narchaeological methods. Additionally, the Neo-Babylonians conducted\nsignificant rebuilding projects in the city, which destroyed or obscured much\nof the earlier record. Babylon was pillaged numerous times after revolting\nagainst foreign rule, most notably by the [Hittites](/wiki/Hittites\n\"Hittites\") and [Elamites](/wiki/Elamites \"Elamites\") in the 2nd millennium,\nthen by the [Neo-Assyrian Empire](/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire \"Neo-Assyrian\nEmpire\") and the [Achaemenid Empire](/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire \"Achaemenid\nEmpire\") in the 1st millennium. Much of the western half of the city is now\nbeneath the river, and other parts of the site have been mined for commercial\nbuilding materials.\n\nOnly the Koldewey expedition recovered artifacts from the Old Babylonian\nperiod. These included 967 clay tablets, stored in private houses, with\nSumerian literature and lexical documents.[19]\n\nNearby ancient settlements are [Kish](/wiki/Kish_\\(Sumer\\) \"Kish \\(Sumer\\)\"),\n[Borsippa](/wiki/Borsippa \"Borsippa\"), [Dilbat](/wiki/Dilbat \"Dilbat\"), and\n[Kutha](/wiki/Kutha \"Kutha\").

One of the earliest is a tablet\ndescribing the Akkadian king Šar-kali-šarri laying the foundations in Babylon\nof new temples for Annūnı̄tum and Ilaba. Babylon also appears in the\nadministrative records of the [Third Dynasty of Ur](/wiki/Third_Dynasty_of_Ur\n\"Third Dynasty of Ur\"), which collected in-kind tax payments and appointed an\n_[ensi](/wiki/Ens%C3%AD \"Ensí\")_ as local governor.[13][21]\n\nThe so-called [Weidner\nChronicle](/wiki/Babylonian_Chronicles#Provenanced_Chronicles \"Babylonian\nChronicles\") (also known as _ABC 19_) states that [Sargon of\nAkkad](/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad \"Sargon of Akkad\") (c. 23d century BC in the\n[short chronology](/wiki/Short_chronology \"Short chronology\")) had built\nBabylon \"in front of Akkad\" (ABC 19:51). A later chronicle states that Sargon\n\"dug up the dirt of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next\nto Akkad\". (ABC 20:18–19). Van de Mieroop has suggested that those sources may\nrefer to the much later Assyrian king [Sargon II](/wiki/Sargon_II \"Sargon II\")\nof the [Neo-Assyrian Empire](/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire \"Neo-Assyrian Empire\")\nrather than Sargon of Akkad.[18]\n\nThe [Book of Genesis](/wiki/Book_of_Genesis \"Book of Genesis\"), chapter 10,\nclaims that king [Nimrod](/wiki/Nimrod \"Nimrod\") founded Babel, Uruk, and\nAkkad.\n\n### Classical dating[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Babylon&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Classical dating\")]\n\n[Ctesias](/wiki/Ctesias \"Ctesias\"), quoted by [Diodorus\nSiculus](/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus \"Diodorus Siculus\") and in [George\nSyncellus](/wiki/George_Syncellus \"George Syncellus\")'s _Chronographia_ ,\nclaimed to have access to manuscripts from Babylonian archives, which date the\nfounding of Babylon to 2286 BC, under the reign of its first king,\n[Belus](/wiki/Belus_\\(Babylonian\\) \"Belus \\(Babylonian\\)\").[22] A similar\nfigure is found in the writings of [Berossus](/wiki/Berossus \"Berossus\"), who\naccording to Pliny,[23] stated that astronomical observations commenced at\nBabylon 490 years before the Greek era of [Phoroneus](/wiki/Phoroneus\n\"Phoroneus\"), indicating 2243 BC. [Stephanus of\nByzantium](/wiki/Stephanus_of_Byzantium \"Stephanus of Byzantium\") wrote that\nBabylon was built 1002 years before the date given by [Hellanicus of\nLesbos](/wiki/Hellanicus_of_Lesbos \"Hellanicus of Lesbos\") for the siege of\nTroy (1229 BC), which would date Babylon's foundation to 2231 BC.[24] All of\nthese dates place Babylon's foundation in the [[23rd century BC; however,\ncuneiform records have not been found to correspond with these classical\n(post-cuneiform) accounts.\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Babylon&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Queen_of_the_Night_%28Babylon%29.jpg/220px-\nQueen_of_the_Night_%28Babylon%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Queen_of_the_Night_\\(Babylon\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Queen_of_the_Night_\\(Babylon\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Queen of the Night](/wiki/Burney_Relief \"Burney Relief\") relief.

[Sumu-la-\nEl](/wiki/Sumu-la-El \"Sumu-la-El\"), whose dates may be concurrent with those\nof Sumu-abum, is usually given as the progenitor of the [First Babylonian\nDynasty](/wiki/First_Babylonian_Dynasty \"First Babylonian Dynasty\"). Both are\ncredited with building the walls of Babylon. In any case, the records describe\nSumu-la-El’s military successes establishing a regional sphere of influence\nfor Babylon.[26]\n\nBabylon was initially a minor city-state, and controlled little surrounding\nterritory; its first four Amorite rulers did not assume the title of king. The\nolder and more powerful states of [Assyria](/wiki/Assyria \"Assyria\"),\n[Elam](/wiki/Elam \"Elam\"), [Isin](/wiki/Isin \"Isin\") and [Larsa](/wiki/Larsa\n\"Larsa\") overshadowed Babylon until it became the capital of\n[Hammurabi](/wiki/Hammurabi \"Hammurabi\")'s short lived empire about a century\nlater. Hammurabi (r. 1792–1750 BC) is famous for codifying the laws of\nBabylonia into the _[Code of Hammurabi](/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi \"Code of\nHammurabi\")_. He conquered all of the cities and city states of southern\nMesopotamia, including [Isin](/wiki/Isin \"Isin\"), [Larsa](/wiki/Larsa\n\"Larsa\"), [Ur](/wiki/Ur \"Ur\"), [Uruk](/wiki/Uruk \"Uruk\"),\n[Nippur](/wiki/Nippur \"Nippur\"), [Lagash](/wiki/Lagash \"Lagash\"),\n[Eridu](/wiki/Eridu \"Eridu\"), [Kish](/wiki/Kish_\\(Sumer\\) \"Kish \\(Sumer\\)\"),\n[Adab](/wiki/Adab_\\(city\\) \"Adab \\(city\\)\"), [Eshnunna](/wiki/Eshnunna\n\"Eshnunna\"), [Akshak](/wiki/Akshak \"Akshak\"), [Akkad](/wiki/Akkad_\\(city\\)\n\"Akkad \\(city\\)\"), [Shuruppak](/wiki/Shuruppak \"Shuruppak\"), [Bad-\ntibira](/wiki/Bad-tibira \"Bad-tibira\"), [Sippar](/wiki/Sippar \"Sippar\") and\n[Girsu](/wiki/Girsu \"Girsu\"), coalescing them into one kingdom, ruled from\nBabylon. Hammurabi also invaded and conquered [Elam](/wiki/Elam \"Elam\") to the\neast, and the kingdoms of [Mari](/wiki/Mari,_Syria \"Mari, Syria\") and\n[Ebla](/wiki/Ebla \"Ebla\") to the north west. After a protracted struggle with\nthe powerful Assyrian king [Ishme-Dagan](/wiki/Ishme-Dagan \"Ishme-Dagan\") of\nthe [Old Assyrian Empire](/wiki/Old_Assyrian_Empire \"Old Assyrian Empire\"), he\nforced his successor to pay tribute late in his reign, spreading Babylonian\npower to Assyria's [Hattian](/wiki/Hattians \"Hattians\") and\n[Hurrian](/wiki/Hurrian \"Hurrian\") colonies in [Asia Minor](/wiki/Asia_Minor\n\"Asia Minor\").\n\nAfter the reign of Hammurabi, the whole of southern Mesopotamia came to be\nknown as [Babylonia](/wiki/Babylonia \"Babylonia\"), whereas the north had\nalready coalesced centuries before into [Assyria](/wiki/Assyria \"Assyria\").\nFrom this time, Babylon supplanted [Nippur](/wiki/Nippur \"Nippur\") and\n[Eridu](/wiki/Eridu \"Eridu\") as the major religious centers of southern\nMesopotamia. Hammurabi's empire destabilized after his death. Assyrians\ndefeated and drove out the Babylonians and Amorites. The far south of\nMesopotamia broke away, forming the native [Sealand\nDynasty](/wiki/Sealand_Dynasty \"Sealand Dynasty\"), and the Elamites\nappropriated territory in eastern Mesopotamia. The Amorite dynasty remained in\npower in Babylon, which again became a small city state.\n\nTexts from Old Babylon often include references to [Shamash](/wiki/Shamash\n\"Shamash\"), the sun-god of Sippar, treated as a supreme deity, and\n[Marduk](/wiki/Marduk \"Marduk\"), considered as his son. Marduk was later\nelevated to a higher status and Shamash lowered, perhaps reflecting Babylon’s\nrising political power[13]\n\n### Middle Babylon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Babylon&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Middle Babylon\")]\n\nIn 1595 BC[b] the city was overthrown by the [Hittite\nEmpire](/wiki/Hittite_Empire \"Hittite Empire\") from [Asia\nMinor](/wiki/Asia_Minor \"Asia Minor\"). Thereafter, [Kassites](/wiki/Kassites\n\"Kassites\") from the [Zagros Mountains](/wiki/Zagros_Mountains \"Zagros\nMountains\") of north western [Ancient Iran](/wiki/Ancient_Iran \"Ancient Iran\")\ncaptured Babylon, ushering in a dynasty that lasted for 435 years, until 1160\nBC. The city was renamed Karanduniash during this period. Kassite Babylon\neventually became subject to the [Middle Assyrian\nEmpire](/wiki/Middle_Assyrian_Empire \"Middle Assyrian Empire\") (1365–1053 BC)\nto the north, and [Elam](/wiki/Elam \"Elam\") to the east, with both powers\nvying for control of the city. The Assyrian king [Tukulti-Ninurta\nI](/wiki/Tukulti-Ninurta_I \"Tukulti-Ninurta I\") took the throne of Babylon in\n1235 BC.\n\nBy 1155 BC, after continued attacks and annexing of territory by the Assyrians\nand Elamites, the Kassites were deposed in Babylon. An Akkadian south\nMesopotamian dynasty then ruled for the first time. However, Babylon remained\nweak and subject to domination by Assyria. Its ineffectual native kings were\nunable to prevent new waves of foreign West Semitic settlers from the deserts\nof the Levant, including the [Arameans](/wiki/Arameans \"Arameans\") and\n[Suteans](/wiki/Suteans \"Suteans\") in the 11th century BC, and finally the\n[Chaldeans](/wiki/Chaldea \"Chaldea\") in the 9th century BC, entering and\nappropriating areas of Babylonia for themselves. The Arameans briefly ruled in\nBabylon during the late 11th century BC.\n\n### Assyrian period[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Babylon&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Assyrian period\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Sennacherib.jpg/220px-\nSennacherib.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sennacherib.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sennacherib.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSennacherib of Assyria during his [Babylonian war](/wiki/Battle_of_Halule\n\"Battle of Halule\"), relief from his palace in Nineveh\n\nDuring the rule of the [Neo-Assyrian Empire](/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire \"Neo-\nAssyrian Empire\") (911–609 BC), Babylonia was under constant\n[Assyrian](/wiki/Assyria \"Assyria\") domination or direct control. During the\nreign of [Sennacherib](/wiki/Sennacherib \"Sennacherib\") of Assyria, Babylonia\nwas in a constant state of revolt, led by a chieftain named [Merodach-\nBaladan](/wiki/Marduk-apla-iddina_II \"Marduk-apla-iddina II\"), in alliance\nwith the [Elamites](/wiki/Elamites \"Elamites\"), and suppressed only by the\ncomplete destruction of the city of Babylon. In 689 BC, its walls, temples and\npalaces were razed, and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu, the sea\nbordering the earlier Babylon on the south. Destruction of the religious\ncenter shocked many, and the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by two of his\nown sons while praying to the god [Nisroch](/wiki/Nisroch \"Nisroch\") was\nconsidered an act of atonement. Consequently, his successor\n[Esarhaddon](/wiki/Esarhaddon \"Esarhaddon\") hastened to rebuild the old city\nand make it his residence during part of the year. After his death, Babylonia\nwas governed by his elder son, the [Assyrian](/wiki/Assyria \"Assyria\") prince\n[Shamash-shum-ukin](/wiki/Shamash-shum-ukin \"Shamash-shum-ukin\"), who\neventually started a civil war in 652 BC against his own brother,\n[Ashurbanipal](/wiki/Ashurbanipal \"Ashurbanipal\"), who ruled in\n[Nineveh](/wiki/Nineveh \"Nineveh\"). Shamash-shum-ukin enlisted the help of\nother peoples subject to Assyria, including [Elam](/wiki/Elam \"Elam\"),\n[Persia](/wiki/Persia \"Persia\"), [Chaldeans](/wiki/Chaldea \"Chaldea\") and\n[Suteans](/wiki/Suteans \"Suteans\") of southern Mesopotamia, and the\n[Canaanites](/wiki/Canaanites \"Canaanites\") and [Arabs](/wiki/Arabs \"Arabs\")\ndwelling in the deserts south of [Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia\n\"Mesopotamia\").\n\nOnce again, Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians, starved into surrender and\nits allies were defeated. Ashurbanipal celebrated a \"service of\nreconciliation\", but did not venture to \"take the hands\" of\n[Bel](/wiki/Bel_\\(mythology\\) \"Bel \\(mythology\\)\"). An Assyrian governor named\n[Kandalanu](/wiki/Kandalanu \"Kandalanu\") was appointed as ruler of the city.\nAshurbanipal did collect texts from Babylon for inclusion in his extensive\n[library](/wiki/Library_of_Ashurbanipal \"Library of Ashurbanipal\") at\nNinevah.[19]\n\nAfter the death of Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian empire destabilized due to a\nseries of internal civil wars throughout the reigns of Assyrian kings [Ashur-\netil-ilani](/wiki/Ashur-etil-ilani \"Ashur-etil-ilani\"), [Sin-shumu-\nlishir](/wiki/Sin-shumu-lishir \"Sin-shumu-lishir\") and\n[Sinsharishkun](/wiki/Sinsharishkun \"Sinsharishkun\"). Eventually Babylon, like\nmany other parts of the near east, took advantage of the anarchy within\nAssyria to free itself from Assyrian rule.

Babylon's walls were considered\nimpenetrable. The only way into the city was through one of its many gates or\nthrough the Euphrates River. Metal grates were installed underwater, allowing\nthe river to flow through the city walls while preventing intrusion. The\nPersians devised a plan to enter the city via the river. During a Babylonian\nnational feast, Cyrus' troops diverted the Euphrates River upstream, allowing\nCyrus' soldiers to enter the city through the lowered water. The Persian army\nconquered the outlying areas of the city while the majority of Babylonians at\nthe city center were unaware of the breach. The account was elaborated upon by\n[Herodotus](/wiki/Herodotus \"Herodotus\")[35][20] and is also mentioned in\nparts of the Hebrew Bible.[36][37]\n\n(Herodotus also described a moat, an enormously tall and broad wall cemented\nwith [bitumen](/wiki/Bitumen \"Bitumen\") and with buildings on top, and a\nhundred gates to the city. He also writes that the Babylonians wear turbans\nand perfume and bury their dead in honey, that they practice ritual\nprostitution, and that three tribes among them [eat nothing but\nfish](/wiki/Piscivore \"Piscivore\"). The hundred gates can be considered a\nreference to [Homer](/wiki/Homer \"Homer\"), and following the pronouncement of\n[Archibald Henry Sayce](/wiki/Archibald_Henry_Sayce \"Archibald Henry Sayce\")\nin 1883, Herodotus’s account of Babylon has largely been considered to\nrepresent Greek folklore rather than an authentic voyage to Babylon.

Text found on the [Cyrus\nCylinder](/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder \"Cyrus Cylinder\") has traditionally been seen\nby biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of this policy, although the\ninterpretation is disputed because the text only identifies Mesopotamian\nsanctuaries but makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea.\n\nUnder Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king [Darius I](/wiki/Darius_I \"Darius\nI\"), Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy (Babylonia in the\nsouth and Athura in the north), as well as a center of learning and scientific\nadvancement. In [Achaemenid](/wiki/Achaemenid \"Achaemenid\") Persia, the\nancient Babylonian arts of [astronomy](/wiki/Astronomy \"Astronomy\") and\n[mathematics](/wiki/Mathematics \"Mathematics\") were revitalized, and\nBabylonian scholars completed maps of constellations. The city became the\nadministrative capital of the [Persian Empire](/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire\n\"Achaemenid Empire\") and remained prominent for over two centuries. Many\nimportant archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better\nunderstanding of that era.[39][40]\n\nThe early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of\n[Marduk](/wiki/Marduk \"Marduk\"), but by the reign of [Darius\nIII](/wiki/Darius_III \"Darius III\"), over-taxation and the strain of numerous\nwars led to a deterioration of Babylon's main shrines and canals, and the\ndestabilization of the surrounding region. There were numerous attempts at\nrebellion and in 522 BC ([Nebuchadnezzar III](/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_III\n\"Nebuchadnezzar III\")), 521 BC ([Nebuchadnezzar IV](/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_IV\n\"Nebuchadnezzar IV\")) and 482 BC (Bel-shimani and Shamash-eriba) native\nBabylonian kings briefly regained independence.

A\nnative account of this invasion notes a ruling by Alexander not to enter the\nhomes of its inhabitants.[41]\n\nUnder Alexander, Babylon again flourished as a center of learning and\ncommerce.

It was long been noted that many of Sumu-abum’s year names are identical or virtually identical to the year names of Sumu-la-el, whom we know for certain was king of Babylon. Goddeeris (2002:319-320) sums these parallels up as follows: Sa 1 and 2 / Sl 5 and 6: building the wall of Babylon. Sa 9 / Sl ‘b’: building the wall of Dilbat.

When new territory was conquered or a rebellious vassal crushed, an increased imperial presence in the trouble spot was often complemented by the removal of large numbers of the indigenous population to the imperial core, effectively breaking up the rebellious population and reducing the potential for future resistance. This practice was effective, and continued throughout the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires until 539 BC and Cyrus’s conquest of Babylon. The majority of the immigrant population were not slaves (Yamauchi 2002: 365), and some did rise to high status positions at the core of the empire (a possibility reflected in the career of the biblical Daniel, who rises to the status of trusted royal confidant).”\n  35. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Herodotus, Book 1, ch.
