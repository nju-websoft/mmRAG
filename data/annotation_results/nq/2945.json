He is confronted\nby rival archaeologist [René\nBelloq](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Ren.C3.A9_Belloq\n\"List of characters in the Indiana Jones series\") and the indigenous\n[Hovito](/wiki/Jibito_people \"Jibito people\") people. Surrounded and\noutnumbered, Indy surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting\n[floatplane](/wiki/Floatplane \"Floatplane\").\n\nJones returns to his teaching position at a New England college, where he is\ninterviewed by two [Army\nIntelligence](/wiki/Military_Intelligence_Corps_\\(United_States_Army\\)\n\"Military Intelligence Corps \\(United States Army\\)\") agents. They inform him\nthat the [Nazis](/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi Germany\") are searching for his old\nmentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the [University of\nChicago](/wiki/University_of_Chicago \"University of Chicago\"). The Nazis know\nthat Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of\n[Tanis](/wiki/Tanis \"Tanis\") in [Egypt](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Egypt \"Kingdom of\nEgypt\"), and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of [Ra](/wiki/Ra\n\"Ra\"). Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the [Ark of the\nCovenant](/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant \"Ark of the Covenant\") – the Nazis believe\nthat if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff\nof Ra is the key to finding the [Well of Souls](/wiki/Well_of_Souls \"Well of\nSouls\"), a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.\n\nThe agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from\nobtaining it. He travels to [Nepal](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Nepal \"Kingdom of Nepal\")\nand discovers that Abner has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of\nRavenwood's daughter [Marion](/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood \"Marion Ravenwood\").\nJones visits Marion at her [tavern](/wiki/Tavern \"Tavern\"), where she reveals\nher bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically\nrebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a\ngroup of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, [Arnold\nToht](/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#Arnold_Ernst_Toht \"List of\nIndiana Jones characters\"). Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but\nwhen Jones returns to the bar to fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is\naccidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire\nand Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees\nthe tavern screaming. Indy and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion\ndecides to accompany Indy in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt\nto her.\n\nThe pair travels to [Cairo](/wiki/Cairo \"Cairo\"), where they meet up with\nIndy's friend [Sallah](/wiki/Sallah \"Sallah\"), a skilled\n[excavator](/wiki/Excavation_\\(archaeology\\) \"Excavation \\(archaeology\\)\").\nSallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well of\nSouls with a replica of the headpiece (created from the scar on Toht's hand).\nThey quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are\ndigging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones\nthat she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in\na local bar, Indy and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff\nto correctly locate the Ark. Indy discovers Marion is alive, bound and gagged\nin a tent, but does not release her for fear of alerting the Nazis. Indy,\nSallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of Souls and acquire the\nArk. Belloq and Nazi officer [Colonel\nDietrich](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Colonel_Dietrich\n\"List of characters in the Indiana Jones series\") arrive, seize the Ark from\nJones, throwing Marion into the Well of Souls with him before sealing it back\nup. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight\nwith a Nazi mechanic and destroys the [flying wing](/wiki/Flying_wing \"Flying\nwing\") that was to transport the Ark to [Berlin](/wiki/Berlin \"Berlin\"). The\npanicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones\ncatches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to\n[London](/wiki/London \"London\") aboard a [tramp steamer](/wiki/Tramp_trade\n\"Tramp trade\").\n\nThe next day, a Nazi [U-boat](/wiki/U-boat \"U-boat\") appears and intercepts\nthe ship. Belloq and Dietrich seize the Ark and Marion but cannot locate\nJones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels with them to an island in\nthe [Aegean Sea](/wiki/Aegean_Sea \"Aegean Sea\"). Once there, Belloq plans to\ntest the power of the Ark before presenting it to [Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler\n\"Adolf Hitler\"). Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a\n[panzerfaust](/wiki/Panzerfaust \"Panzerfaust\"), but Belloq calls his bluff and\nJones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact.\nThe Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie\nthem to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark,\nwhich appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten\nCommandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy\ncautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what happens next.\nBelloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly\nrevealed to be angels of death. A [vortex of\nflame](/wiki/Pillar_of_Fire_\\(theophany\\) \"Pillar of Fire \\(theophany\\)\")\nforms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi\nsoldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror,\nthe Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is\nmelted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the\nremains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of\nfire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before\ndropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their\nropes burned off and embrace.\n\nIn [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\"), the Army\nIntelligence agents inform Jones and [Marcus Brody](/wiki/Marcus_Brody \"Marcus\nBrody\") that the Ark is someplace safe and will be studied by \"top men\". The\nArk is shown being stored in a giant government warehouse among countless\nsimilar crates.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\nSee also: [List of Indiana Jones\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters \"List of Indiana Jones\ncharacters\")\n\n  * [Harrison Ford](/wiki/Harrison_Ford \"Harrison Ford\") stars as [Indiana Jones](/wiki/Indiana_Jones \"Indiana Jones\"), an [archaeology](/wiki/Archaeology \"Archaeology\") professor who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts. Jones claims that he has no belief in the supernatural, only to have his skepticism challenged when he discovers the Ark. Spielberg suggested casting Ford as Jones, but Lucas objected, stating that he did not want Ford to become his \"[Bobby De Niro](/wiki/Robert_De_Niro \"Robert De Niro\")\" or \"that guy I put in all my movies\"—a reference to [Martin Scorsese](/wiki/Martin_Scorsese \"Martin Scorsese\"), who [often worked with](/wiki/Martin_Scorsese_and_Robert_De_Niro \"Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro\") Robert De Niro.[5] Desiring a lesser known actor, Lucas persuaded Spielberg to help him search for a new talent. Among the actors who auditioned were [Tim Matheson](/wiki/Tim_Matheson \"Tim Matheson\"), [Peter Coyote](/wiki/Peter_Coyote \"Peter Coyote\"), [John Shea](/wiki/John_Shea \"John Shea\"), and [Tom Selleck](/wiki/Tom_Selleck \"Tom Selleck\"). Selleck was originally offered the role, but became unavailable for the part because of his commitment to the television series _[Magnum, P.I.](/wiki/Magnum,_P.I. \"Magnum, P.I.\")_.[5][6][6] In June 1980, three weeks away from filming,[7] Spielberg persuaded Lucas to cast Ford after producers [Frank Marshall](/wiki/Frank_Marshall_\\(film_producer\\) \"Frank Marshall \\(film producer\\)\") and [Kathleen Kennedy](/wiki/Kathleen_Kennedy_\\(film_producer\\) \"Kathleen Kennedy \\(film producer\\)\") were impressed by his performance as [Han Solo](/wiki/Han_Solo \"Han Solo\") in _[The Empire Strikes Back](/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back \"The Empire Strikes Back\")_.[8]\n  * [Paul Freeman](/wiki/Paul_Freeman_\\(actor\\) \"Paul Freeman \\(actor\\)\") as Dr. [René Belloq](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Ren.C3.A9_Belloq \"List of characters in the Indiana Jones series\"), Jones' rival. Belloq is also an archaeologist after the Ark, but he is working for the Nazis. He intends to harness the Ark's power himself before [Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler \"Adolf Hitler\") can, but he is killed by the Ark's supernatural powers. Spielberg cast Freeman after seeing him in _[Death of a Princess](/wiki/Death_of_a_Princess \"Death of a Princess\")_.[9] Before Freeman got the part, actor [Giancarlo Giannini](/wiki/Giancarlo_Giannini \"Giancarlo Giannini\") was originally going to portray Belloq,[10] while singer [Jacques Dutronc](/wiki/Jacques_Dutronc \"Jacques Dutronc\") auditioned for the role, but they lost out to Freeman.\n  * [Karen Allen](/wiki/Karen_Allen \"Karen Allen\") as [Marion Ravenwood](/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood \"Marion Ravenwood\"), a spirited, tough former lover of Indiana's. She is the daughter of Abner Ravenwood, Indiana Jones' mentor, and owns a bar in Nepal. Allen was cast after auditioning with Matheson and [John Shea](/wiki/John_Shea \"John Shea\"). Spielberg was interested in her, as he had seen her performance in _[National Lampoon's Animal House](/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Animal_House \"National Lampoon's Animal House\")_. [Sean Young](/wiki/Sean_Young \"Sean Young\") had previously auditioned for the part,[5] while [Debra Winger](/wiki/Debra_Winger \"Debra Winger\") turned it down.[11]\n  * [John Rhys-Davies](/wiki/John_Rhys-Davies \"John Rhys-Davies\") as [Sallah](/wiki/Sallah \"Sallah\"), \"the best digger in Egypt\" according to Indiana, who has been hired by the Nazis to help them excavate Tanis. He is an old friend of Indiana's, and agrees to help him obtain the Ark, though he fears disturbing it. Spielberg initially approached [Danny DeVito](/wiki/Danny_DeVito \"Danny DeVito\") to play Sallah, but he could not play the part due to scheduling conflicts. Spielberg cast Rhys-Davies after seeing his performance in _[Shōgun](/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_\\(miniseries\\) \"Shōgun \\(miniseries\\)\")_.[5]\n  * [Ronald Lacey](/wiki/Ronald_Lacey \"Ronald Lacey\") as Major [Arnold Toht](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Toht \"List of characters in the Indiana Jones series\"), an interrogator for the [Gestapo](/wiki/Gestapo \"Gestapo\") and Jones' nemesis, who tries to torture Marion Ravenwood for the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. He is killed by the Ark's supernatural powers. Lacey was cast as he reminded Spielberg of [Peter Lorre](/wiki/Peter_Lorre \"Peter Lorre\").[5] Spielberg had originally offered the role to [Roman Polanski](/wiki/Roman_Polanski \"Roman Polanski\"), who was intrigued at the opportunity to work with Spielberg but decided to turn down the role because he wouldn't be able to make the trip to [Tunisia](/wiki/Tunisia \"Tunisia\").[12] [Klaus Kinski](/wiki/Klaus_Kinski \"Klaus Kinski\") was also offered the role, but he hated the script,[13] calling it \"moronically shitty\".[14] [Michael Sheard](/wiki/Michael_Sheard \"Michael Sheard\"), who ended portraying Captain Oskar Schomburg in the film, also auditioned for the role, but he lost out to Lacey.[15]\n  * [Denholm Elliott](/wiki/Denholm_Elliott \"Denholm Elliott\") as Dr. [Marcus Brody](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Marcus_Brody \"List of characters in the Indiana Jones series\"), a [museum curator](/wiki/Museum_curator \"Museum curator\"), who buys the artifacts Indiana obtains for display in his museum. The U.S. government agents approach him with regard to the Ark's recovery, and he sets up a meeting between them and Indiana Jones. Spielberg hired Elliott as he was a big fan of the actor, who had performed in some of his favorite British and American films.[5]\n  * [Wolf Kahler](/wiki/Wolf_Kahler \"Wolf Kahler\") as [Colonel Dietrich](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Colonel_Dietrich \"List of characters in the Indiana Jones series\"), a ruthless German officer leading the operation to secure the Ark. He is killed by the Ark's supernatural powers.\n  * [Alfred Molina](/wiki/Alfred_Molina \"Alfred Molina\"), in his film debut, as [Satipo](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Satipo \"List of characters in the Indiana Jones series\"), one of Jones' guides through the South American jungle. He betrays Jones and steals the golden idol, but is killed by traps before he can leave the temple.\n  * [George Harris](/wiki/George_Harris_\\(actor\\) \"George Harris \\(actor\\)\") as Simon Katanga, captain of the _Bantu Wind_.\n  * [Anthony Higgins](/wiki/Anthony_Higgins_\\(actor\\) \"Anthony Higgins \\(actor\\)\") as Major Gobler, Colonel Dietrich's right-hand-man.\n  * [Vic Tablian](/wiki/Vic_Tablian \"Vic Tablian\") as Barranca and the Monkey Man.\n  * [Don Fellows](/wiki/Don_Fellows \"Don Fellows\") as Colonel Musgrove, an Army Intelligence agent.\n  * [William Hootkins](/wiki/William_Hootkins \"William Hootkins\") as Major Eaton, an Army Intelligence agent.\n\nProducer [Frank Marshall](/wiki/Frank_Marshall_\\(film_producer\\) \"Frank\nMarshall \\(film producer\\)\") played a pilot in the airplane fight sequence.\nThe stunt team was ill, so he took the role instead. The result was three days\nin a hot cockpit, which he joked was over \"140 degrees\".[5] [Pat\nRoach](/wiki/Pat_Roach \"Pat Roach\") plays the Nazi mechanic with whom Jones\nbrawls in this sequence, as well as a massive sherpa who battles Jones in\nMarion's bar. He had the rare opportunity to be killed twice in one film.[16]\nSpecial-effects supervisor [Dennis Muren](/wiki/Dennis_Muren \"Dennis Muren\")\nmade a [cameo](/wiki/Cameo_appearance \"Cameo appearance\") as a Nazi spy on the\n[seaplane](/wiki/Seaplane \"Seaplane\") Jones takes from [San\nFrancisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\") to [Manila](/wiki/Manila\n\"Manila\").[17]\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nIn 1973, [George Lucas](/wiki/George_Lucas \"George Lucas\") wrote _The\nAdventures of Indiana Smith_.[18] Like _[Star Wars](/wiki/Star_Wars_\\(film\\)\n\"Star Wars \\(film\\)\"),_ which he also wrote, it was an opportunity to create a\nmodern version of the [film serials](/wiki/Movie_serial \"Movie serial\") of the\n1930s and 1940s.[5] Lucas discussed the concept with [Philip\nKaufman](/wiki/Philip_Kaufman \"Philip Kaufman\"), who worked with him for\nseveral weeks and came up with the [Ark of the\nCovenant](/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant \"Ark of the Covenant\") as the [plot\ndevice](/wiki/Plot_device \"Plot device\").[19] Kaufman was told about the Ark\nby his dentist when he was a child.[20] The project stalled when [Clint\nEastwood](/wiki/Clint_Eastwood \"Clint Eastwood\") hired Kaufman to direct _[The\nOutlaw Josey Wales](/wiki/The_Outlaw_Josey_Wales \"The Outlaw Josey\nWales\")_.[19] Lucas shelved the idea, deciding to concentrate on his outer\nspace adventure that would become _Star Wars_. In late May 1977, Lucas was in\n[Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii_\\(island\\) \"Hawaii \\(island\\)\"), trying to escape the\nenormous success of _Star Wars_. Friend and colleague [Steven\nSpielberg](/wiki/Steven_Spielberg \"Steven Spielberg\") was also there, on\nvacation from work on _[Close Encounters of the Third\nKind](/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind \"Close Encounters of the Third\nKind\")_. While building a sand castle at the [Mauna Kea Beach\nHotel](/wiki/Mauna_Kea_Beach_Hotel \"Mauna Kea Beach Hotel\"),[21] Spielberg\nexpressed an interest in directing a [James Bond](/wiki/James_Bond \"James\nBond\") film. Lucas convinced his friend Spielberg that he had conceived a\ncharacter \"better than James Bond\" and explained the concept of _Raiders of\nthe Lost Ark_. Spielberg loved it, calling it \"a James Bond film without the\nhardware\",[22] although he told Lucas that the surname 'Smith' was not right\nfor the character. Lucas replied, \"OK. What about 'Jones'?\" Indiana was the\nname of Lucas' [Alaskan Malamute](/wiki/Alaskan_Malamute \"Alaskan Malamute\"),\nwhose habit of riding in the passenger seat as Lucas drove was also the\ninspiration for Star Wars' [Chewbacca](/wiki/Chewbacca \"Chewbacca\").[5]\nSpielberg was at first reluctant to sign on, as Lucas had told him that he\nwould want Spielberg for an entire trilogy, and Spielberg did not want to work\non two more scripts. Lucas told him, however, that he already had the next two\nmovies written, so Spielberg agreed. But when the time came for the first\nsequel, it was revealed that Lucas had nothing written for either sequel.[5]\n\nThe following year, Lucas focused on developing _Raiders_ and the _Star Wars_\nsequel _[The Empire Strikes Back](/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back \"The Empire\nStrikes Back\")_ , during which [Lawrence Kasdan](/wiki/Lawrence_Kasdan\n\"Lawrence Kasdan\") and [Frank Marshall](/wiki/Frank_Marshall_\\(film_producer\\)\n\"Frank Marshall \\(film producer\\)\") joined the project as screenwriter and\nproducer respectively. Between January 23 – 27, 1978, for nine hours a day,\nLucas, Kasdan, and Spielberg discussed the story and visual ideas. Spielberg\ncame up with Jones being chased by a boulder,[5] which was inspired by [Carl\nBarks](/wiki/Carl_Barks \"Carl Barks\")' [Uncle Scrooge](/wiki/Uncle_Scrooge\n\"Uncle Scrooge\") comic \"The Seven Cities of Cibola\". Lucas later acknowledged\nthat the idea for the idol mechanism in the opening scene and deadly traps\nlater in the film were inspired by several Uncle Scrooge comics.[23] Lucas\ncame up with a submarine, a monkey giving the [Hitler\nsalute](/wiki/Hitler_salute \"Hitler salute\"), and Marion punching Jones in\n[Nepal](/wiki/Nepal \"Nepal\").[22] Kasdan used a 100-page transcript of their\nconversations for his first script draft,[24] which he worked on for six\nmonths.[5] Ultimately, some of their ideas were too grand and had to be cut: a\nmine chase,[25] an escape in [Shanghai](/wiki/Shanghai \"Shanghai\") using a\nrolling gong as a shield,[26] and a jump from an airplane in a raft, all of\nwhich made it into the prequel, _[Indiana Jones and the Temple of\nDoom](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom \"Indiana Jones and the Temple\nof Doom\")_.[5]\n\nSpielberg and Lucas disagreed on the character: although Spielberg saw him as\na Bondian playboy, Lucas felt the character's academic and adventurer elements\nmade him complex enough.[27] Spielberg had a darker vision of Jones,\ninterpreting him as an [alcoholic](/wiki/Alcoholic \"Alcoholic\") similar to\n[Humphrey Bogart](/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart \"Humphrey Bogart\")'s character Fred C.\nDobbs in _[The Treasure of the Sierra\nMadre](/wiki/The_Treasure_of_the_Sierra_Madre_\\(film\\) \"The Treasure of the\nSierra Madre \\(film\\)\")_ (1948). This characterization fell away during the\nlater drafts, though elements survive in Jones's reaction when he believes\nMarion to be dead.[22] Costume designer [Deborah\nNadoolman](/wiki/Deborah_Nadoolman \"Deborah Nadoolman\") credits _[Secret of\nthe Incas](/wiki/Secret_of_the_Incas \"Secret of the Incas\")_ (1954), starring\n[Charlton Heston](/wiki/Charlton_Heston \"Charlton Heston\"), as an influence on\nthe development of the character, noting that the crew watched the film\ntogether several times. Nadoolman based the look of Ford's costume on that of\nHeston's, and observed that Indiana is a \"kinder and gentler\" Harry\nSteele.[28]\n\nInitially, the film was rejected by every major studio in\n[Hollywood](/wiki/Hollywood \"Hollywood\"), mostly due to the $20 million budget\nand the deal Lucas was offering.[29] Eventually Paramount agreed to finance\nthe film, with Lucas negotiating a five-picture deal. By April 1980, Kasdan's\nfifth draft was produced, and production was getting ready to shoot at\n[Elstree Studios](/wiki/Elstree_Studios \"Elstree Studios\"), with Lucas trying\nto keep costs down.[8] With four illustrators, _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ was\nSpielberg's most [storyboarded](/wiki/Storyboard \"Storyboard\") film of his\ncareer to date, further helping the film economically. He and Lucas agreed on\na tight schedule to keep costs down and to follow the \"quick and dirty\" feel\nof the old Saturday matinée serials. Special effects were done using puppets,\nminiature models, animation, and camera trickery.[5] \"We didn't do 30 or 40\ntakes; usually only four. It was like silent film--shoot only what you need,\nno waste\", Spielberg said. \"Had I had more time and money, it would have\nturned out a pretentious movie.\"[30]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\nbegan on June 23, 1980, at [La Rochelle](/wiki/La_Rochelle \"La Rochelle\"),\nFrance, with scenes involving the Nazi submarine,[8] which had been rented\nfrom the production of _[Das Boot](/wiki/Das_Boot \"Das Boot\")_. The U-boat pen\nwas a real one from [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\").[5] The\ncrew moved to [Elstree Studios](/wiki/Elstree_Studios \"Elstree Studios\")[8]\nfor the [Well of Souls](/wiki/Well_of_Souls \"Well of Souls\") scenes, the\nopening sequence temple interiors and [Marion\nRavenwood](/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood \"Marion Ravenwood\")'s bar.[31] The Well of\nSouls scene required 7,000 snakes. The only venomous snakes were the\n[cobras](/wiki/Cobras \"Cobras\"), but one crew member was bitten on set by a\npython.[5] The bulk of the snakes' numbers were made up with giant but\nharmless legless lizards known as [Scheltopusiks](/wiki/Scheltopusik\n\"Scheltopusik\") (_Pseudopus apodus_) which occur from the [Balkan\nPeninsula](/wiki/Balkans \"Balkans\") of southeastern Europe to [Central\nAsia](/wiki/Central_Asia \"Central Asia\"). Growing to 1.3 m they are the\nlargest [legless lizards](/wiki/Legless_lizard \"Legless lizard\") in the world\nand are often mistaken for snakes despite some very obvious differences such\nas the presence of eyelids and external ear openings, which are both absent\nfrom all snakes, and a notched rather than forked tongue. In the finished\nfilm, during the scene in which Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a\nreflection in glass screen that protected Ford from the snake was seen,[5] an\nissue that was corrected in the 2003 digitally-enhanced re-release. Unlike\nIndiana, neither Ford nor Spielberg has a fear of snakes, but Spielberg said\nthat seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him \"want to\npuke\".[5]\n\nThe opening scene in the Peruvian jungle was filmed on the island of\n[Kauai](/wiki/Kauai \"Kauai\"), one of the islands of Hawaii, to where Spielberg\nwould return for _[Jurassic Park](/wiki/Jurassic_Park \"Jurassic Park\")_. The\n\"temple\" location is on the Huleia River, on the Kipu Ranch, south from\nKaumualii Highway on the east coast, just south of [Lihue](/wiki/Lihue\n\"Lihue\"), the island's main town. Kipu is a working cattle ranch, not\ngenerally open to the public.[32] The Peruvian section (but actually filmed in\nHawaii) featured live [tarantulas](/wiki/Tarantulas \"Tarantulas\") of a Mexican\nspecies (_[Brachypelma](/wiki/Brachypelma \"Brachypelma\")_) on [Harrison\nFord](/wiki/Harrison_Ford \"Harrison Ford\") and [Alfred\nMolina](/wiki/Alfred_Molina \"Alfred Molina\"), and are harmless to humans, and\nin fact of a species which are commonly kept as exotic pets. A\n[fiberglass](/wiki/Fiberglass \"Fiberglass\") boulder 22 feet (7 m) in diameter\nwas made for the scene where Indiana escapes from the temple; Spielberg was so\nimpressed by production designer Norman Reynolds' realization of his idea that\nhe gave the boulder a more prominent role in the film and told Reynolds to let\nthe boulder roll another 50 feet (15 m).[33]\n\nThe scenes set in [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt \"Egypt\") were filmed in\n[Tunisia](/wiki/Tunisia \"Tunisia\"), and the canyon where Indiana threatens to\nblow up the Ark was shot in Sidi Bouhlel, just outside [Tozeur](/wiki/Tozeur\n\"Tozeur\").[34] The canyon location had been used for the\n[Tatooine](/wiki/Tatooine \"Tatooine\") scenes from 1977's _[Star\nWars](/wiki/Star_Wars_\\(film\\) \"Star Wars \\(film\\)\")_ (many of the location\ncrew members were the same for both films[5]) where [R2-D2](/wiki/R2-D2\n\"R2-D2\") was attacked by [Jawas](/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_races_\\(F-J\\)#Jawa\n\"List of Star Wars races \\(F-J\\)\").[5] The Tanis scenes were filmed in nearby\nSedala, a harsh place due to heat and disease. Several cast and crew members\nfell ill and Rhys-Davies [defecated](/wiki/Defecation \"Defecation\") in his\ncostume during one shot.[5] Spielberg averted disease by eating only [canned\nfoods](/wiki/Canned_food \"Canned food\") from England, but did not like the\narea and quickly condensed the scheduled six-week shoot to four-and-a-half\nweeks. Much was improvised: the scene where Marion puts on her dress and\nattempts to leave Belloq's tent was improvised as was the entire plane fight.\nDuring that scene's shooting, a wheel went over Ford's knee and tore his left\nleg's [cruciate ligament](/wiki/Cruciate_ligament \"Cruciate ligament\"), but he\nrefused local medical help and simply put ice on it.[5]\n\nThe fight scenes in the town were filmed in [Kairouan](/wiki/Kairouan\n\"Kairouan\"), while Ford was suffering from [dysentery](/wiki/Dysentery\n\"Dysentery\"). Stuntman [Terry Richards](/wiki/Terry_Richards_\\(actor\\) \"Terry\nRichards \\(actor\\)\") had practiced for weeks with his sword to create the\nscripted fight scene, choreographing a fight between the swordsman and Jones'\nwhip.[35] However, after filming the initial shots of the scene, after lunch\ndue to Ford's dysentery, Ford and Spielberg agreed to cut the scene down to a\ngunshot, with Ford saying to Spielberg \"Let's just shoot the sucker\".[36] It\nwas later voted in at No.5 on [_Playboy_](/wiki/Playboy_magazine \"Playboy\nmagazine\") magazine's list of best all time scenes.[35][37] Most of the truck\nchase was shot by [second unit](/wiki/Second_unit \"Second unit\") director\n[Michael D. Moore](/wiki/Michael_D._Moore \"Michael D. Moore\") following\nSpielberg's storyboards, including Indiana being dragged by the truck\n(performed by stuntman Terry Leonard), in tribute to a famous [Yakima\nCanutt](/wiki/Yakima_Canutt \"Yakima Canutt\") stunt. Spielberg then filmed all\nthe shots with Ford himself in and around the truck cab.[5] Lucas directed a\nfew other second unit shots, in particular the monkey giving the Nazi\nsalute.[30]\n\nThe interior staircase set in [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C.\n\"Washington, D.C.\") was filmed in [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San\nFrancisco\")'s [City Hall](/wiki/San_Francisco_City_Hall \"San Francisco City\nHall\"). The [University of the\nPacific](/wiki/University_of_the_Pacific_\\(United_States\\) \"University of the\nPacific \\(United States\\)\")'s campus in [Stockton,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Stockton,_California \"Stockton, California\"), stood in for\nthe exterior of the college where Jones works, while his classroom and the\nhall where he meets the American intelligence agents was filmed at the [Royal\nMasonic School for Girls](/wiki/Royal_Masonic_School_for_Girls \"Royal Masonic\nSchool for Girls\") in [Rickmansworth](/wiki/Rickmansworth \"Rickmansworth\"),\n[Hertfordshire](/wiki/Hertfordshire \"Hertfordshire\"), [England](/wiki/England\n\"England\"), which was again used in _[The Last\nCrusade](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade \"Indiana Jones and the Last\nCrusade\")_. His home exteriors were filmed in [San Rafael,\nCalifornia](/wiki/San_Rafael,_California \"San Rafael, California\").[31]\nOpening sequence exteriors were filmed in [Kauai](/wiki/Kauai \"Kauai\"),\nHawaii, with Spielberg wrapping in September in 73 days, finishing under\nschedule in contrast to his previous film, _[1941](/wiki/1941_\\(film\\) \"1941\n\\(film\\)\")_.[8][22] The Washington, D.C. coda, although it appeared in the\nscript's early drafts, was not included in early edits but was added later\nwhen it was realized that there was no resolution to Jones' relationship with\nMarion.[38] Shots of the [Douglas DC-3](/wiki/Douglas_DC-3 \"Douglas DC-3\")\nJones flies on to Nepal were taken from _[Lost\nHorizon](/wiki/Lost_Horizon_\\(1973_film\\) \"Lost Horizon \\(1973 film\\)\")_ , and\na street scene was from a shot in _[The\nHindenburg](/wiki/The_Hindenburg_\\(film\\) \"The Hindenburg \\(film\\)\")_.[30]\nFilming of Jones boarding a Boeing [Clipper](/wiki/Boeing_314 \"Boeing 314\")\nflying-boat was complicated by the lack of a surviving aircraft. Eventually, a\npost-war British [Short Solent](/wiki/Short_Solent \"Short Solent\") flying-boat\nformerly owned by [Howard Hughes](/wiki/Howard_Hughes \"Howard Hughes\") was\nlocated in California and substituted.[39]\n\n### Visual effects and sound\ndesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Visual effects and sound design\")]\n\nThe special visual effects for _Raiders_ were provided by [Industrial Light &\nMagic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic \"Industrial Light & Magic\") and\ninclude: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am [flying boat](/wiki/Flying_boat\n\"Flying boat\") in the water[40] and miniature work to show the plane taking\noff and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the\nTanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers[41] superimposed over a\nmatte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of\neffects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the\nCovenant (which was designed by [Brian Muir](/wiki/Brian_Muir_\\(sculptor\\)\n\"Brian Muir \\(sculptor\\)\") and [Keith Short](/wiki/Keith_Short \"Keith Short\"))\nis opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a\nwoman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through\nwater to convey a sense of floating,[42] a matte painting of the island, and\ncloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by\nexposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp\nwith an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model\nfrom which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the\n[Motion Picture Association of\nAmerica](/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America \"Motion Picture\nAssociation of America\"), it received an R rating because of the scene in\nwhich Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating\nwhen they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene.\n([PG-13](/wiki/PG-13 \"PG-13\") rating was not created until 1984.[17]) The\nfirestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed\nupside down.[42]\n\n[Ben Burtt](/wiki/Ben_Burtt \"Ben Burtt\"), the sound effects supervisor, made\nextensive use of traditional [foley](/wiki/Foley_\\(filmmaking\\) \"Foley\n\\(filmmaking\\)\") work in yet another of the production's throwbacks to days of\nthe [Republic](/wiki/Republic_Pictures \"Republic Pictures\")\n[serials](/wiki/Serial_film \"Serial film\"). He selected a [.30-30\nWinchester](/wiki/.30-30_Winchester \".30-30 Winchester\") rifle for the sound\nof Jones' [pistol](/wiki/Pistol \"Pistol\"). Sound effects artists struck\nleather jackets and [baseball gloves](/wiki/Baseball_glove \"Baseball glove\")\nwith a [baseball bat](/wiki/Baseball_bat \"Baseball bat\") to create a variety\nof punching noises and body blows. For the snakes in the Well of Souls\nsequence, fingers running through cheese casserole and sponges sliding over\nconcrete were used for the slithering noises. The sliding lid on a toilet\ncistern provided the sound for the opening of the Ark, and the sound of the\nboulder in the opening is a car rolling down a gravel driveway in neutral.\nBurtt also used, as he did in many of his films, the ubiquitous [Wilhelm\nscream](/wiki/Wilhelm_scream \"Wilhelm scream\") when a Nazi falls from a truck.\nIn addition to his use of such time-honored foley work, Burtt also\ndemonstrated the modern expertise honed during his award-winning work on _Star\nWars_. He employed a synthesizer for the sounds of the Ark, and mixed\ndolphins' and sea lions' screams for those of the spirits within.[43]\n\n###\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png) |  [\"The Raiders March\" (1981)](/wiki/File:John_Williams_The_Raiders%27_March_from_Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark.ogg \"File:John Williams The Raiders' March from Raiders of the Lost Ark.ogg\") ![](data:image/png,%89PNG%0D%0A%1A%0A%00%00%00%0DIHDR%00%00%00%01%00%00%00%01%08%02%00%00%00%90wS%DE%00%00%00%01sRGB%00%AE%CE%1C%E9%00%00%00%09pHYs%00%00%0B%13%00%00%0B%13%01%00%9A%9C%18%00%00%00%07tIME%07%DB%0B%0A%17%041%80%9B%E7%F2%00%00%00%19tEXtComment%00Created%20with%20GIMPW%81%0E%17%00%00%00%0CIDAT%08%D7c%60%60%60%00%00%00%04%00%01'4'%0A%00%00%00%00IEND%AEB%60%82)[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d0/John_Williams_The_Raiders%27_March_from_Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark.ogg) Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\n* * *  \n  \n---|---  \n_Problems playing this file?

The score most notably\nfeatures the well-known \"Raiders March\". This piece came to symbolize Indiana\nJones and was later used in the scores for the other three films. Williams\noriginally wrote two different candidates for Jones's theme, but Spielberg\nenjoyed them so much that he insisted that both be used together in what\nbecame the \"Raiders March\".[44] The alternately eerie and apocalyptic theme\nfor the Ark of the Covenant is also heard frequently in the score, with a more\nromantic melody representing Marion and, more broadly, her relationship with\nJones. The score as a whole received an Oscar nomination for Best Original\nScore, but lost to the score to _[Chariots of Fire](/wiki/Chariots_of_Fire\n\"Chariots of Fire\")_ composed by [Vangelis](/wiki/Vangelis \"Vangelis\").\n\n##\nRelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Release\")]\n\n###\nMerchandise[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Merchandise\")]\n\nThe only [video game](/wiki/Video_game \"Video game\") based exclusively on the\nfilm is _[Raiders of the Lost\nArk](/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark_\\(Atari_2600\\) \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\\(Atari 2600\\)\")_ , released in 1982 by [Atari](/wiki/Atari \"Atari\") for their\n[Atari 2600](/wiki/Atari_2600 \"Atari 2600\") console.[45] The first third of\nthe video game _[Indiana Jones' Greatest\nAdventures](/wiki/Indiana_Jones%27_Greatest_Adventures \"Indiana Jones'\nGreatest Adventures\")_, released in 1994 by JVC for [Nintendo](/wiki/Nintendo\n\"Nintendo\")'s [Super Nintendo Entertainment\nSystem](/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System \"Super Nintendo\nEntertainment System\"), is based entirely on the film.

In his review\nfor _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ ,\n[Vincent Canby](/wiki/Vincent_Canby \"Vincent Canby\") praised the film, calling\nit, \"one of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American\nadventure movies ever made.\"[61] [Roger Ebert](/wiki/Roger_Ebert \"Roger\nEbert\") in his review for the _[Chicago Sun-Times](/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times\n\"Chicago Sun-Times\")_ wrote, \"Two things, however, make _Raiders of the Lost\nArk_ more than just a technological triumph: its sense of humor and the droll\nstyle of its characters [...] We find ourselves laughing in surprise, in\nrelief, in incredulity at the movie's ability to pile one incident upon\nanother in an inexhaustible series of inventions.\"[62] He later added it to\nhis list of \"Great Movies\".[63] _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling\nStone\")_ said the film was \"the ultimate Saturday action matinee–a film so\nfunny and exciting it can be enjoyed any day of the week.\"[64] Bruce\nWilliamson of _[Playboy](/wiki/Playboy \"Playboy\")_ claimed: \"There's more\nexcitement in the first ten minutes of _Raiders_ than any movie I have seen\nall year. By the time the explosive misadventures end, any movie-goer worth\nhis salt ought to be exhausted.\"[65] Stephen Klain of\n_[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_ also praised\nthe film. Yet, making an observation that would revisit the franchise with its\nnext film, he felt that the film was surprisingly violent and bloody for a PG-\nrated film.[66]\n\nThere were some dissenting voices: _[Sight& Sound](/wiki/Sight_%26_Sound\n\"Sight & Sound\")_ described it as an \"expensively gift-wrapped Saturday\nafternoon pot-boiler\",[67] and [New Hollywood](/wiki/New_Hollywood \"New\nHollywood\") champion [Pauline Kael](/wiki/Pauline_Kael \"Pauline Kael\"), who\nonce contended that she only got \"really rough\" on large films that were\ndestined to be hits but were nonetheless \"atrocious\",[68] found the film to be\na \"machine-tooled adventure\" from a pair of creators who \"think just like the\nmarketing division\".[69] (Lucas later named a villain, played by _Raiders_\nNazi strongman [Pat Roach](/wiki/Pat_Roach \"Pat Roach\"), in his 1988 fantasy\nfilm _[Willow](/wiki/Willow_\\(film\\) \"Willow \\(film\\)\")_ after Kael.)[68] On\n[Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\"), the film has a 94%\n\"Certified Fresh\" rating on [Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten\nTomatoes\"),[70] as well as a 85% rating on Metacritic, indicating \"universal\nacclaim\".[71]\n\n###\nAccolades[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Accolades\")]\n\nAwards and nominations  \n---  \nAssociation | Category | Nominee(s) | Result | Ref.  \n[Academy Awards](/wiki/Academy_Awards \"Academy Awards\") | [Best Picture](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture \"Academy Award for Best Picture\") | [Frank Marshall](/wiki/Frank_Marshall_\\(producer\\) \"Frank Marshall \\(producer\\)\") | Nominated | [72]  \n[Best Director](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director \"Academy Award for Best Director\") | [Steven Spielberg](/wiki/Steven_Spielberg \"Steven Spielberg\") | Nominated  \n[Best Art Direction](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Production_Design \"Academy Award for Best Production Design\") | [Norman Reynolds](/wiki/Norman_Reynolds \"Norman Reynolds\"), [Leslie Dilley](/wiki/Leslie_Dilley \"Leslie Dilley\"), and [Michael D.

Numerous other books,\n[comics](/wiki/Indiana_Jones_Comics \"Indiana Jones Comics\"), and video games\nhave also been produced.\n\nIn 1998, the [American Film Institute](/wiki/American_Film_Institute \"American\nFilm Institute\") placed the film at number 60 on its top 100 films of the\nfirst century of cinema. In 2007, AFI updated the list and placed it at number\n66. They also named it as the 10th most thrilling film, and named Indiana\nJones as the second greatest hero. In 1999, the film was deemed \"culturally,\nhistorically, or aesthetically significant\" by the U.S. [Library of\nCongress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library of Congress\") and selected for\npreservation in the [National Film Registry](/wiki/National_Film_Registry\n\"National Film Registry\"). Indiana Jones has become an icon, being listed as\n_[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\")_ 's\nthird favorite action hero, while noting \"some of the greatest action scenes\never filmed are strung together like pearls\" in this film.[76]\n\nAn amateur, near shot-for-shot remake was made by Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala,\nand Jayson Lamb, then children in [Ocean Springs,\nMississippi](/wiki/Ocean_Springs,_Mississippi \"Ocean Springs, Mississippi\").\nIt took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982 to 1989. After production of\nthe film, called _[Raiders of the Lost Ark: The\nAdaptation](/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark:_The_Adaptation \"Raiders of the Lost\nArk: The Adaptation\")_ , it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, where it was\ndiscovered by [Eli Roth](/wiki/Eli_Roth \"Eli Roth\")[77][78] and acclaimed by\nSpielberg himself, who congratulated the boys on their hard work and said he\nlooked forward to seeing their names on the big screen.[79] [Scott\nRudin](/wiki/Scott_Rudin \"Scott Rudin\") and [Paramount\nPictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\") purchased the trio's\nlife rights with the goal of producing a film based on their adventures making\ntheir remake.[80][81]\n\nIn 2014, film director [Steven Soderbergh](/wiki/Steven_Soderbergh \"Steven\nSoderbergh\") published an experimental black-and-white version of the film,\nwith the original soundtrack and dialogue replaced by an electronic\nsoundtrack. Soderbergh said his intention was to encourage viewers to focus on\nSpielberg's extraordinary staging and editing: \"This filmmaker forgot more\nabout staging by the time he made his first feature than I know to this\nday.\"[82]\n\nAssessing the film's legacy in 1997, Bernard Weinraub, film critic for _[The\nNew York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ , which had\ninitially reviewed the film as \"deliriously funny, ingenious, and\nstylish\",[83] maintained that \"the decline in the traditional family G-rated\nfilm, for 'general' audiences, probably began\" with the appearance of _Raiders\nof the Lost Ark_. \"Whether by accident or design,\" found Weinraub, \"the\nfilmmakers made a comic nonstop action film intended mostly for adults but\nalso for children.\"[84] Eight years later, in 2005, viewers of [Channel\n4](/wiki/Channel_4 \"Channel 4\") rated the film as the 20th-best [family\nfilm](/wiki/Family_film \"Family film\") of all time, with Spielberg taking best\nover-all director honors.[85]\n\nOn _[Empire](/wiki/Empire_\\(magazine\\) \"Empire \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine's list\nof the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, _Raiders_ ranked second, beaten only\nby _[The Godfather](/wiki/The_Godfather \"The Godfather\")_.[86]\n\nIn conjunction with the Blu-ray release, a limited one-week release in\n[IMAX](/wiki/IMAX \"IMAX\") theaters was announced for September 7, 2012. Steven\nSpielberg and sound designer Ben Burtt supervised the format conversion. No\nspecial effects or other visual elements were altered, but the audio was\nenhanced for [surround sound](/wiki/Surround_sound \"Surround sound\").[87]\n\n### 2012 replica\nmystery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: 2012 replica mystery\")]\n\nIn December 2012, the [University of Chicago](/wiki/University_of_Chicago\n\"University of Chicago\")'s admissions department received a package in the\nmail addressed to Henry Walton Jones, Jr., Indiana Jones' full name. The\naddress on the stamped package was listed for a hall that was the former home\nof the university's geology and geography department. Inside the manila\nenvelope was a detailed [replica](/wiki/Replica \"Replica\") journal similar to\nthe one Jones used in the movie, as well as postcards and pictures of [Marion\nRavenwood](/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood \"Marion Ravenwood\"). The admissions\ndepartment posted pictures of the contents on its Internet blog, looking for\nany information about the package. It was discovered that the package was part\nof a set to be shipped from Guam to Italy that had been sold on\n[eBay](/wiki/EBay \"EBay\"). The package with the journal had fallen out in\ntransit and a postal worker had sent it to the university, as it had a\ncomplete address and postage, which turned out to be fake. All contents were\nfrom a [Guam](/wiki/Guam \"Guam\") \"prop replicator\" who sells them all over the\nworld. The university will display its replica in the main lobby of the\nOriental Institute.[88]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of films considered the best](/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_best \"List of films considered the best\")\n\n  * [![United States film.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/United_States_film.svg/24px-United_States_film.svg.png)](/wiki/File:United_States_film.svg)[Film in the United States portal](/wiki/Portal:Film_in_the_United_States \"Portal:Film in the United States\")\n  * [![Rubik's cube v3.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg/19px-Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg)[1980s portal](/wiki/Portal:1980s \"Portal:1980s\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"_RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK_ (A)\"](http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/raiders-lost-ark-1). _[British Board of Film Classification](/wiki/British_Board_of_Film_Classification \"British Board of Film Classification\")_.
