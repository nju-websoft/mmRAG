[Exodus\n31:18](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0231.htm#18) refers to the tablets\nas the \"Tablets of (the) Testimony\".\n\nAccording to the Bible, there were two sets. The first, inscribed by God,\n([Exodus\n31:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+31%3A18&version=NIV))\nwere smashed by Moses when he was enraged by the sight of the [Children of\nIsrael](/wiki/Children_of_Israel \"Children of Israel\") worshipping a [golden\ncalf](/wiki/Golden_calf \"Golden calf\") ([Exodus\n32:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+32%3A19&version=NIV))\nand the second were later cut by Moses and rewritten by God. ([Exodus\n34:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A1&version=NIV))\n\nAccording to traditional teachings of [Judaism](/wiki/Judaism \"Judaism\") in\nthe [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\"), they were made of blue\n[sapphire](/wiki/Sapphire \"Sapphire\") stone as a symbolic reminder of the sky,\nthe heavens, and ultimately of God's [throne](/wiki/Throne \"Throne\"). Many\n[Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") scholars, however, have opined that the Biblical\n\"_sapir_ \" was, in fact, the [lapis lazuli](/wiki/Lapis_lazuli \"Lapis lazuli\")\n(see [Exodus\n24:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+24%3A10&version=NIV),\nlapis lazuli is a possible alternate rendering of \"sapphire\" the stone\npavement under God's feet when the intention to craft the tablets of the\ncovenant is disclosed [Exodus\n24:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+24%3A12&version=NIV)).\n[1]\n\nAccording to the bible, both the first shattered set and the second unbroken\nset were stored in the [Ark of the Covenant](/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant \"Ark of\nthe Covenant\") (the _Aron Habrit_ in Hebrew).\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Appearance of the tablets\n  * 2 Content\n  * 3 Christian replicas\n  * 4 In the Qur'an\n  * 5 Gallery\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n\n## Appearance of the\ntablets[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tablets_of_Stone&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Appearance of the tablets\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/The10Commandments.png/220px-\nThe10Commandments.png)](/wiki/File:The10Commandments.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The10Commandments.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA popular image of the Tablets as rounded-off rectangles bears little\nrelationship with religious traditions about their appearance. In this case,\nthe [Ten Commandments](/wiki/Ten_Commandments \"Ten Commandments\") are\nrepresented by the first ten letters of the [Hebrew\nalphabet](/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet \"Hebrew alphabet\"), which in Hebrew usage may\nbe used [interchangeably with the numbers 1-10](/wiki/Gematria \"Gematria\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Meister_der_Bibel_des_Patrice_L%C3%A9on_001.jpg/220px-\nMeister_der_Bibel_des_Patrice_L%C3%A9on_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Meister_der_Bibel_des_Patrice_L%C3%A9on_001.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Meister_der_Bibel_des_Patrice_L%C3%A9on_001.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRectangular tablets passed down by the [Hand of God](/wiki/Hand_of_God_\\(art\\)\n\"Hand of God \\(art\\)\") in the 10th century [Byzantine](/wiki/Byzantine\n\"Byzantine\") [Leo Bible](/wiki/Leo_Bible \"Leo Bible\").\n\nIn recent centuries the tablets have been popularly described and depicted as\nround-topped rectangles but this has little basis in religious tradition.\nAccording to Rabbinic tradition, they were rectangles, with sharp corners,[2]\nand indeed they are so depicted in the 3rd century paintings at the [Dura-\nEuropos Synagogue](/wiki/Dura-Europos_Synagogue \"Dura-Europos Synagogue\") and\nin Christian art throughout the 1st millennium,[3] drawing on Jewish\ntraditions of [iconography](/wiki/Iconography \"Iconography\").\n\nThe rounded tablets appear in the Middle Ages, following in size and shape\ncontemporary hinged [writing tablets](/wiki/Wax_tablet \"Wax tablet\") for\ntaking notes (with a stylus on a layer of wax on the insides). For\n[Michelangelo](/wiki/Michelangelo \"Michelangelo\") and [Andrea\nMantegna](/wiki/Andrea_Mantegna \"Andrea Mantegna\") they still have sharp\ncorners (see gallery), and are about the size found in Rabbinic tradition.\nLater artists such as [Rembrandt](/wiki/Rembrandt \"Rembrandt\") tended to\ncombine the rounded shape with the larger size. While, as mentioned above,\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the tablets were squared, according to some\nauthorities, the Rabbis themselves approved of rounded depictions of the\ntablets in replicas so that the replicas would not exactly match the\nhistorical tablets.[4]\n\nAccording to the Talmud, the length and width of each of the Tablets was six\n[Tefachim](/wiki/Biblical_and_Talmudic_units_of_measurement \"Biblical and\nTalmudic units of measurement\"), and each was three Tefachim thick -\nrespectively roughly 20 and ten inches,[5] though they tend to be shown larger\nin art. Also according to tradition, the words were not engraved on the\nsurface, but rather were bored fully through the stone.\n\n## Content[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tablets_of_Stone&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Content\")]\n\nIn [Jewish religious tradition](/wiki/Judaism \"Judaism\"), the arrangement of\nthe commandments on the two tablets is interpreted in different ways. Rabbi\n[Hanina ben Gamaliel](/wiki/List_of_Jewish_leaders_in_the_Land_of_Israel \"List\nof Jewish leaders in the Land of Israel\") said that each tablet contained five\ncommandments, \"but the Sages say ten on one tablet and ten on the other\".[6]\nBecause the commandments establish a covenant, it is likely that they were\nduplicated on both tablets. This can be compared to diplomatic\n[treaties](/wiki/Treaty \"Treaty\") of [Ancient Egypt](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt\n\"Ancient Egypt\"), in which a copy was made for each party.[7] But the tablets\nmay have contained not only the Ten Commandments but also additional precepts\nand words as can be inferred from the verses Exodus 31:18, Exodus 34:1, Exodus\n34:27-28.
