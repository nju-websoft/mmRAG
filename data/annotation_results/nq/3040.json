The possession demonstrates the end-of-half intricacies of\nthe [National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation](/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National\nCollegiate Athletic Association\")'s former 35-second shot clock (red\n[LED](/wiki/LED \"LED\")) when possession changes and the game clock (white LED;\nnote the decimal point) is below 35 seconds.\n\nA **shot clock** is used in some sports to quicken the pace of the game. It is\nnormally associated with [basketball](/wiki/Basketball \"Basketball\"), but is\nalso used in [snooker](/wiki/Snooker \"Snooker\"),\n[pro](/wiki/Major_League_Lacrosse \"Major League Lacrosse\")\n[lacrosse](/wiki/Lacrosse \"Lacrosse\"), [water polo](/wiki/Water_polo \"Water\npolo\"), [korfball](/wiki/Korfball \"Korfball\"), and [ten-pin\nbowling](/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling \"Ten-pin bowling\"). It is analogous with the\n[play clock](/wiki/Play_clock \"Play clock\") used in\n[American](/wiki/American_football \"American football\") and [Canadian\nfootball](/wiki/Canadian_football \"Canadian football\").\n\nIn basketball, the shot clock is a [timer](/wiki/Timer \"Timer\") designed to\nincrease the game's pace and scoring.[1] The offensive team must attempt to\nget the ball into the basket by the ball leaving the player's hand before the\nshot clock expires, and the shot must either touch the\n[rim](/wiki/Breakaway_rim \"Breakaway rim\") or enter the basket. If the\noffensive team fails to register a field goal attempt within the time limit,\nthey are assessed a violation resulting in a\n[turnover](/wiki/Turnover_\\(basketball\\) \"Turnover \\(basketball\\)\") to their\nopponents; if the ball hits or enters the rim after the clock expires, it is\nnot a violation so long as it left the player's hand _before_ expiration. The\nmaximum time limit of the shot clock varies by level of play and league: The\n[National Basketball Association](/wiki/National_Basketball_Association\n\"National Basketball Association\") has had a 24-second limit since first\nintroducing the clock in the 1950s; and college basketball for both men and\nwomen has a 30-second limit. The\n[WNBA](/wiki/Women%27s_National_Basketball_Association \"Women's National\nBasketball Association\") had a 30-second clock originally; since 2006 the\nlimit is 24 seconds, just like in the NBA.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Background\n    * 1.2 Creation\n    * 1.3 Use and reaction\n    * 1.4 Adoption by other leagues\n  * 2 Operation\n  * 3 Similar rules in basketball\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_clock&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n### Background[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_clock&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/GeorgeMikan.jpg/220px-\nGeorgeMikan.jpg)](/wiki/File:GeorgeMikan.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GeorgeMikan.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStall tactics to limit big man [George Mikan](/wiki/George_Mikan \"George\nMikan\") (#99) led to the shot clock's creation by the NBA.\n\nThe NBA (National Basketball Association) had problems attracting fans (and\npositive media coverage) before the shot clock's inception.[2] This was due to\nteams [running out the clock](/wiki/Running_out_the_clock \"Running out the\nclock\") once they were leading in a game; without the shot clock, teams passed\nthe ball nearly endlessly without penalty. If one team chose to stall, the\nother team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to get the ball\nback following the free throw. Very low-scoring games with many fouls were\ncommon, which bored fans. The most extreme case occurred on November 22, 1950,\nwhen the [Fort Wayne Pistons](/wiki/Fort_Wayne_Pistons \"Fort Wayne Pistons\")\ndefeated the [Minneapolis Lakers](/wiki/Minneapolis_Lakers \"Minneapolis\nLakers\") by a record-low score of 19–18, including 3–1 in the fourth\nquarter.[3] The Pistons held the ball for minutes at a time without shooting\n(they attempted 13 shots for the game) in order to limit the impact of the\nLakers' dominant [George Mikan](/wiki/George_Mikan \"George Mikan\"). The\nPistons' performance led the _[St. Paul Dispatch](/wiki/St._Paul_Dispatch \"St.\nPaul Dispatch\")_ to write \"[The Pistons] gave pro basketball a great black\neye.\"[4] NBA President [Maurice Podoloff](/wiki/Maurice_Podoloff \"Maurice\nPodoloff\") said, \"In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of\nnecessity run up big scores.\"[5] A few weeks after the Pistons/Lakers game,\nthe [Rochester Royals](/wiki/Rochester_Royals \"Rochester Royals\") and\n[Indianapolis Olympians](/wiki/Indianapolis_Olympians \"Indianapolis\nOlympians\") played a six-overtime game with only one shot in each overtime -\nin each overtime period, the team who had the ball first held the ball for the\nentirety of the period before attempting a last-second shot. The NBA tried\nseveral rule changes in the early 1950s to speed up the game and reduce fouls\nbefore eventually adopting the shot clock.\n\n### Creation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_clock&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Creation\")]\n\nThe shot clock first came to use in 1954 in [Syracuse, New\nYork](/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York \"Syracuse, New York\"), where [Syracuse\nNationals](/wiki/Syracuse_Nationals \"Syracuse Nationals\") (now the\nPhiladelphia 76ers) owner [Danny Biasone](/wiki/Daniel_Biasone \"Daniel\nBiasone\") and general manager [Leo Ferris](/wiki/Leo_Ferris \"Leo Ferris\")\nexperimented using a 24-second version during a scrimmage game.[6] According\nto Biasone, \"I looked at the box scores from the games I enjoyed, games where\nthey didn't screw around and stall. I noticed each team took about 60 shots.\nThat meant 120 shots per game. So I took 2,880 seconds (48 minutes) and\ndivided that by 120 shots. The result was 24 seconds per shot.\"[3][7] Biasone\nand Ferris then convinced the NBA to adopt it for the [1954–55\nseason](/wiki/1954%E2%80%9355_NBA_season \"1954–55 NBA season\"), a season in\nwhich the Nationals won the [NBA Championship](/wiki/1955_NBA_Finals \"1955 NBA\nFinals\").\n\nSyracuse Nationals General Manager [Leo Ferris](/wiki/Leo_Ferris \"Leo Ferris\")\nhas emerged in the discussion as one of those involved in the creation and\ndevelopment of the shot clock. Along with Danny Biasone and Emil Barboni, a\nscout for the Nats, Leo Ferris was a key figure in developing the 24-second\nclock.[8] Jack Andrews, longtime basketball writer for The Syracuse Post-\nStandard, often recalled how Ferris would sit at Danny Biasone's Eastwood\nbowling alley, scribbling potential shot clock formulas onto a napkin.[9]\nFerris, who loved mathematics, ended up dividing the number of seconds in a\n48-minute game (2,880) by the average number of shots taken in a game (120) to\nget to the 24-second time limit per possession.[10] While he and Biasone often\nshare in the credit for the shot clock, it was Ferris who was singled out by\nbusiness manager Bob Sexton at the 1954 team banquet for pushing the shot\nclock rule.\n\n### Use and\nreaction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_clock&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Use and reaction\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Syracuse_Shot_Clock_Monument.jpg/300px-\nSyracuse_Shot_Clock_Monument.jpg)](/wiki/File:Syracuse_Shot_Clock_Monument.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Syracuse_Shot_Clock_Monument.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Shot Clock Monument in [Syracuse, New York](/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York\n\"Syracuse, New York\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Syracuse_Shot_Clock_Monument_Close-\nUp.jpg/300px-Syracuse_Shot_Clock_Monument_Close-\nUp.jpg)](/wiki/File:Syracuse_Shot_Clock_Monument_Close-Up.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Syracuse_Shot_Clock_Monument_Close-Up.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nClose-up of Syracuse's Shot Clock Monument.\n\nWhen it was first introduced by the NBA, the 24-second shot clock made players\nso nervous that it hardly came into play, as players were taking fewer than 20\nseconds to shoot. According to [Syracuse](/wiki/Syracuse_Nationals \"Syracuse\nNationals\") star [Dolph Schayes](/wiki/Dolph_Schayes \"Dolph Schayes\"), \"We\nthought we had to take quick shots – a pass and a shot was it – maybe 8–10\nseconds... But as the game went on, we saw the inherent genius in Danny's 24\nseconds – you could work the ball around [the offensive zone] for a good\nshot.\"[7]\n\nThe shot clock, together with some rule changes concerning fouls,\nrevolutionized NBA basketball. In the last pre-clock season\n[(1953–54)](/wiki/1953%E2%80%9354_NBA_season \"1953–54 NBA season\"), teams\naveraged 79 points per game; in the first year with the clock\n[(1954–55)](/wiki/1954%E2%80%9355_NBA_season \"1954–55 NBA season\"), the\naverage was 93 points,[3] which went up to 107 points by its fourth year in\nuse [(1957–58)](/wiki/1957%E2%80%9358_NBA_season \"1957–58 NBA season\").[11]\nThe advent of the shot clock (and the resulting increase in scoring) coincided\nwith an increase in attendance, which increased 40% within a few years to an\naverage of 4,800 per game.[12]\n\nThe shot clock received near-universal praise for its role in improving the\nstyle of play in the NBA. Coach and referee [Charley\nEckman](/wiki/Charley_Eckman \"Charley Eckman\") said, \"Danny Biasone saved the\nNBA with the 24-second rule.\"[13] Boston Celtic all-star [Bob\nCousy](/wiki/Bob_Cousy \"Bob Cousy\") said, \"Before the new rule, the last\nquarter could be deadly. The team in front would hold the ball indefinitely,\nand the only way you could get it was by fouling somebody. In the meantime,\nnobody dared take a shot and the whole game slowed up. With the clock, we have\nconstant action. I think it saved the NBA at that time. It allowed the game to\nbreathe and progress.\"[14] League president [Maurice\nPodoloff](/wiki/Maurice_Podoloff \"Maurice Podoloff\") called the adoption of\nthe shot clock \"the most important event in the NBA.\"[3] The league itself\nstates, \"Biasone's invention rescue[d] the league.\"[13]\n\n### Adoption by other\nleagues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_clock&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Adoption by other leagues\")]\n\nTwo later pro leagues that rivaled the NBA adopted a modified version of the\nshot clock. The [American Basketball\nLeague](/wiki/American_Basketball_League_\\(1961%E2%80%931963\\) \"American\nBasketball League \\(1961–1963\\)\") used a 30-second shot clock for its two\nyears in existence (1961–1963). The [American Basketball\nAssociation](/wiki/American_Basketball_Association \"American Basketball\nAssociation\") also adopted a 30-second clock when it launched in 1967–68,\nswitching to the NBA's 24-second length for its final season\n[(1975–76)](/wiki/1975%E2%80%9376_ABA_season \"1975–76 ABA season\").\n\nIn the 1969–70 season, women's collegiate basketball (at the time sanctioned\nby the [Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for\nWomen](/wiki/Commission_on_Intercollegiate_Athletics_for_Women \"Commission on\nIntercollegiate Athletics for Women\")) used a 30-second shot clock on an\nexperimental basis, officially adopting it for the 1970–71 season.[15] Unlike\nthe women's side, there was initial resistance to the implementation of a shot\nclock for men's [NCAA](/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association\n\"National Collegiate Athletic Association\") basketball, due to fears that\nsmaller colleges would be unable to compete with powerhouses in a running\ngame. However, after extreme results like an 11–6\n[Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee_Volunteers_basketball \"Tennessee Volunteers\nbasketball\") win over [Temple](/wiki/Temple_Owls_men%27s_basketball \"Temple\nOwls men's basketball\") in 1973, support for a men's shot clock began to\nbuild.[16] The NCAA introduced a 45-second shot clock for the men's game in\nthe 1985–86 season, reducing it to 35 seconds in the 1993–94 season[17] and 30\nseconds in the 2015–16 season.[18] The NAIA also reduced the shot clock to 30\nseconds for men's basketball starting in 2015–16.[19]\n\nFrom its inception in [1975](/wiki/1975_PBA_season \"1975 PBA season\"), the\n[Philippine Basketball Association](/wiki/Philippine_Basketball_Association\n\"Philippine Basketball Association\") adopted a 25-second shot clock. This was\nbecause the shot clocks then installed at the league's main venues, the\n[Araneta Coliseum](/wiki/Araneta_Coliseum \"Araneta Coliseum\") and [Rizal\nMemorial Coliseum](/wiki/Rizal_Memorial_Coliseum \"Rizal Memorial Coliseum\")\n(the latter no longer used by the league), could only be set at 5-second\nintervals. The league later adopted a 24-second clock starting from the [1995\nseason](/wiki/1995_PBA_season \"1995 PBA season\"). The [Metropolitan Basketball\nAssociation](/wiki/Metropolitan_Basketball_Association \"Metropolitan\nBasketball Association\") in the Philippines used the 23-second clock from its\nmaiden season in 1998. In Filipino college basketball, the [NCAA Basketball\nChampionship (Philippines)](/wiki/NCAA_Basketball_Championship_\\(Philippines\\)\n\"NCAA Basketball Championship \\(Philippines\\)\") and the [UAAP Basketball\nChampionship](/wiki/UAAP_Basketball_Championship \"UAAP Basketball\nChampionship\") adopted a 30-second clock; they switched to 24 seconds starting\nwith the 2001–02 season, the first season to start after the FIBA rule change\nin 2001.\n\n## Operation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_clock&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Operation\")]\n\nIn the NBA (since 1954), [Women's National Basketball\nAssociation](/wiki/Women%27s_National_Basketball_Association \"Women's National\nBasketball Association\") (since 2006), and [FIBA](/wiki/FIBA \"FIBA\") play\n(since 2000; 30-second from 1956 to 2000), the shot clock counts down 24\nseconds, thus often being called the \"24-second clock.\" If a shot is attempted\nand hits or enters the rim, or if the defensive team gains possession via a\n[rebound](/wiki/Rebound_\\(basketball\\) \"Rebound \\(basketball\\)\"),\n[steal](/wiki/Steal_\\(basketball\\) \"Steal \\(basketball\\)\"), or out-of-bounds\nplay, the shot clock resets. Failure by the offense to attempt a shot that\nhits the rim within the prescribed time results in a \"shot clock violation\"\nand a [loss of possession](/wiki/Turnover_\\(basketball\\) \"Turnover\n\\(basketball\\)\") to the other team. Three signals indicate when the shot clock\nexpires—a shot clock signal, illuminated lights on the shot clock (NBA, FIBA,\nEuroleague, and many venues using an NBA-style transparent shot clock), and in\nthe NBA and FIBA play (starting in July 2018), a yellow [LED](/wiki/LED \"LED\")\nlight strip on the backboard. In the [2011–12 NBA\nseason](/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_NBA_season \"2011–12 NBA season\") and [2014–15\nEuroleague](/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_Euroleague \"2014–15 Euroleague\"), the last\nfive seconds of the shot clock were modified to include tenths of a second,\nallowing offensive players to see precisely how much time they have to shoot\nand officials to determine any last-second shots easily. The rule has been\nadopted by FIBA starting in 2018.[20] In the [2016-17 NBA\nseason](/wiki/2016-17_NBA_season \"2016-17 NBA season\"), a new 'official\ntimekeeper' deal for the NBA with Swiss watch manufacturer\n[Tissot](/wiki/Tissot \"Tissot\") introduced a new united official game\nclock/shot clock system, putting both timing systems under the same system for\nthe first time.[21] Tissot also became official timekeeper for the WNBA in the\n2017 season.\n\nFurthermore, the shot clock is not reset on a foul in the frontcourt. Rule\nchanges in the NBA since 1998, and in FIBA after 2010 state the shot clock\nwill be reset only if 13 seconds or fewer are on the shot clock, after which\nit is reset to 14 seconds.\n\nThe NBA and Euroleague have different rules on the shot clock reset on [jump\nballs](/wiki/Jump_ball \"Jump ball\"); while both leagues have jump balls\nretained by the offense are reset to 14 seconds (if 13 seconds or fewer are on\nthe shot clock), in the NBA, if the defense causes the jump ball, the shot\nclock is not reset if the offense keeps control of the ball unless under 5.0\nseconds of time remain, where it is reset to 5.0 seconds.\n\nAlso in FIBA/WNBA play, if the offence retains control of a ball following a\nrebound, the shot clock is reset to 14 seconds.\n\nSince the 2015–16 season, all American college basketball uses a 30-second\nshot clock, while Canadian university basketball uses a 24-second clock. The\nAmerican women's game has used a 30-second clock since the 1970s, but the\nmen's game did not adopt a shot clock until 1985. The men's limit was\noriginally 45 seconds, and was shortened to 35 seconds in 1993 before going to\n30 seconds in 2015. The [National Federation of State High School\nAssociations](/wiki/National_Federation_of_State_High_School_Associations\n\"National Federation of State High School Associations\") (NFHS), which sets\nrules for high school basketball in the U.S., does not mandate the use of a\nshot clock, instead leaving the choice to use a clock and its duration up to\neach individual state association. Proposals to adopt a national shot clock\nfor high school basketball have been voted down by the NFHS as recently as\n2011.[22] Currently, eight U.S. states require the use of a shot clock of\n30/35 seconds in high school competition: California, Maryland, Massachusetts,\nNew York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Washington.[22]\n\nShot clock length in basketball\n\nOrganization  | Duration   \n---|---  \n[NBA](/wiki/National_Basketball_Association \"National Basketball Association\") | 24 seconds   \n14 seconds (offensive retains control after fouls)  \n[WNBA](/wiki/Women%27s_National_Basketball_Association \"Women's National\nBasketball Association\")  \n[U Sports](/wiki/U_Sports \"U Sports\") (Canadian universities)  \n[NCAA](/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National Collegiate Athletic Association\"), [NAIA](/wiki/National_Association_of_Intercollegiate_Athletics \"National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics\") | 30 seconds   \nUnited States high school basketball  | 30/35 seconds (some states only)   \n[FIBA](/wiki/FIBA \"FIBA\") | 24 seconds (full-court game)  \n14 seconds (reset when offense retains ball)  \n12 seconds ([3x3 half-court](/wiki/3x3_\\(basketball\\) \"3x3\n\\(basketball\\)\"))[23]  \n  \nShot clock length in other sports\n\nSport  | Organization  | Duration   \n---|---|---  \n[Lacrosse](/wiki/Lacrosse \"Lacrosse\") | [MLL](/wiki/Major_League_Lacrosse \"Major League Lacrosse\") | 60 seconds   \n[NLL](/wiki/National_Lacrosse_League \"National Lacrosse League\") | 30 seconds   \n[Ringette](/wiki/Ringette \"Ringette\") | N/A  | 30 seconds   \n[Water polo](/wiki/Water_polo \"Water polo\") | [FINA](/wiki/International_Swimming_Federation \"International Swimming Federation\") | 30 seconds   \n[Canoe polo](/wiki/Canoe_polo \"Canoe polo\") | [ICF](/wiki/International_Canoe_Federation \"International Canoe Federation\") | 60 seconds   \n[Ten-pin bowling](/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling \"Ten-pin bowling\") | [PBA](/wiki/Professional_Bowlers_Association \"Professional Bowlers Association\") | 25 seconds   \n[Korfball](/wiki/Korfball \"Korfball\") | [IKF](/wiki/International_Korfball_Federation \"International Korfball Federation\") | 25 seconds   \n[Snooker](/wiki/Snooker \"Snooker\") | [Snooker Shoot-Out](/wiki/Snooker_Shoot-Out \"Snooker Shoot-Out\") | 15 seconds (first five minutes)  \n10 seconds (last five minutes)  \n[Carom billiards](/wiki/Carom_billiards \"Carom billiards\")  \n([Three-cushion billiards](/wiki/Three-cushion_billiards \"Three-cushion billiards\"))  | [World Championship](/wiki/UMB_World_Three-cushion_Championship \"UMB World Three-cushion Championship\")  \n[European Championship](/wiki/CEB_European_Three-cushion_Championship \"CEB\nEuropean Three-cushion Championship\")  \n[World Cup](/wiki/Three-Cushion_World_Cup \"Three-Cushion World Cup\") | 40 seconds[24]  \n(3 time-outs (40 sec.) possible)  \n  \n## Similar rules in\nbasketball[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_clock&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Similar rules in basketball\")]\n\nThe shot clock and its enforcement is used in concert with the\n[rule](/wiki/10-second_basketball_rule \"10-second basketball rule\") that\nrequires an offensive team to advance the ball across half-court and into the\noffensive zone (or front court) within a referee's count (this rule was first\nintroduced in 1933, predating the shot clock by over 2 decades). In men's\ncollege basketball, the offense must advance the ball to the front court\nwithin 10 seconds, the same length used by [FIBA](/wiki/FIBA \"FIBA\") and the\n[NBA](/wiki/National_Basketball_Association \"National Basketball Association\")\nuntil they adopted an 8-second limit in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Failure\nby the offense to advance the ball to the front court within the time limit\nresults in a [turnover](/wiki/Turnover_\\(basketball\\) \"Turnover\n\\(basketball\\)\") to the other team.\n\nGenerally, the 10-second (or 8-second) count is independent from the shot\nclock's operation; in fact, a referee may count the 8 or 10 seconds through a\nvisible motion of his hand or arm. Women's college basketball introduced the\n10-second limit in 2013–2014, and provided that officials will not count the\nten seconds but \"will use the shot clock to determine if a 10-second violation\nhas occurred.\" As a general reference, it refers to the shot clock reaching 15\n(FIBA/[W]NBA; because the NBA shot clock registers tenths in the final five\nseconds, the violation occurs once the clock registers 15.9 seconds on the\nconsole, which is posted as 15 on the clock) or 20 (college) before a\nviolation can be called.[25]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_clock&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Pitch clock](/wiki/Pitch_clock \"Pitch clock\"), used in baseball\n  * [Play clock](/wiki/Play_clock \"Play clock\"), used in American and Canadian football.\n  * [Four corners offense](/wiki/Four_corners_offense \"Four corners offense\"), offensive stall strategy in basketball\n  * Stall Count, used in the sport of [Ultimate](/wiki/Ultimate_\\(sport\\) \"Ultimate \\(sport\\)\").\n  * [Time limit](/wiki/Time_limit_\\(video_game_terminology\\) \"Time limit \\(video game terminology\\)\"), the same concept applied to video games.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_clock&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** For example, the Boston Celtics scored an average of 79.7 points per game from 1946–47 to 1953–54; from 1954–55 to 1961–62, after the introduction of the shot clock, they scored an average of 113.1 points per game.
