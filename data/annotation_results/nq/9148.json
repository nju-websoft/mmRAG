The atmosphere becomes\nthinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary\nbetween the atmosphere and [outer space](/wiki/Outer_space \"Outer space\"). The\n[Kármán line](/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line \"Kármán line\"), at 100 km (62 mi),\nor 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere\nand outer space.

Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the\natmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies\nsignificantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the\natmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and\nconcentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry\nair (without water vapor).[4] The remaining gases are often referred to as\ntrace gases,[5] among which are the [greenhouse gases](/wiki/Greenhouse_gas\n\"Greenhouse gas\"), principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and\nozone.

Layers drawn to scale, objects within\nthe layers are not to scale. Aurorae shown here at the bottom of the\nthermosphere can actually form at any altitude in this atmospheric layer.\n\n### Principal layers\n\nIn general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere.\nHowever, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may\nremain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see\nthe [temperature](/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#Temperature_and_speed_of_sound\n\"Atmosphere of Earth\") section, below). Because the general pattern of the\ntemperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of\ninstrumented [balloon soundings](/wiki/Weather_balloon \"Weather balloon\"), the\ntemperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric\nlayers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric\nstratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere\nhas four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere,\nand thermosphere.[9] From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:\n\n  * Exosphere: 700 to 10,000 km (440 to 6,200 miles)\n  * Thermosphere: 80 to 700 km (50 to 440 miles)[10]\n  * Mesosphere: 50 to 80 km (31 to 50 miles)\n  * Stratosphere: 12 to 50 km (7 to 31 miles)\n  * Troposphere: 0 to 12 km (0 to 7 miles)[11]\n\n#### Exosphere\n\nMain article: [Exosphere](/wiki/Exosphere \"Exosphere\")\n\nThe exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper\nlimit of the atmosphere). It extends from the [exobase](/wiki/Exobase\n\"Exobase\"), which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of\nabout 700 km above sea level, to about 10,000 km (6,200 mi; 33,000,000 ft)\nwhere it merges into the [solar wind](/wiki/Solar_wind \"Solar wind\").\n\nThis layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium\nand several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide\ncloser to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can\ntravel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the\nexosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape\ninto space. These free-moving particles follow [ballistic\ntrajectories](/wiki/Ballistic_trajectories \"Ballistic trajectories\") and may\nmigrate in and out of the [magnetosphere](/wiki/Magnetosphere \"Magnetosphere\")\nor the [solar wind](/wiki/Solar_wind \"Solar wind\").\n\nThe exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena\nto be possible. However, the [aurora borealis](/wiki/Aurora_borealis \"Aurora\nborealis\") and [aurora australis](/wiki/Aurora_australis \"Aurora australis\")\nsometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into\nthe thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting\nEarth.\n\n#### Thermosphere\n\nMain article: [Thermosphere](/wiki/Thermosphere \"Thermosphere\")\n\nThe thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends\nfrom the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of\nabout 80 km (50 mi; 260,000 ft) up to the [thermopause](/wiki/Thermopause\n\"Thermopause\") at an altitude range of 500–1000 km (310–620 mi;\n1,600,000–3,300,000 ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due\nto changes in solar activity.[10] Because the thermopause lies at the lower\nboundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the\n[exobase](/wiki/Exobase \"Exobase\"). The lower part of the thermosphere, from\n80 to 550 kilometres (50 to 342 mi) above Earth's surface, contains the\n[ionosphere](/wiki/Ionosphere \"Ionosphere\").\n\nThe temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike\nthe stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature\n[inversion](/wiki/Inversion_\\(meteorology\\) \"Inversion \\(meteorology\\)\") is\ndue to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere\noccurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of\nthis layer can rise as high as 1500 °C (2700 °F), though the gas molecules are\nso far apart that its [temperature in the usual\nsense](/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases \"Kinetic theory of gases\") is not very\nmeaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of\n[oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\"), for example) travels an average of 1\nkilometre (0.62 mi; 3300 ft) between collisions with other molecules.[12]\nAlthough the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy,\nit would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too\nlow to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.\n\nThis layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-\nhydrometeorological phenomena such as the [aurora\nborealis](/wiki/Aurora_borealis \"Aurora borealis\") and [aurora\naustralis](/wiki/Aurora_australis \"Aurora australis\") are occasionally seen in\nthe thermosphere. The [International Space\nStation](/wiki/International_Space_Station \"International Space Station\")\norbits in this layer, between 350 and 420 km (220 and 260 mi).\n\n#### Mesosphere\n\nMain article: [Mesosphere](/wiki/Mesosphere \"Mesosphere\")\n\nThe mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the\nregion above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the\nstratopause at an altitude of about 50 km (31 mi; 160,000 ft) to the mesopause\nat 80–85 km (50–53 mi; 260,000–280,000 ft) above sea level.\n\nTemperatures drop with increasing altitude to the [mesopause](/wiki/Mesopause\n\"Mesopause\") that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is\nthe coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around −85\n[°C](/wiki/Celsius \"Celsius\") (−120 [°F](/wiki/Fahrenheit \"Fahrenheit\"); 190\n[K](/wiki/Kelvin \"Kelvin\")).[13][14]\n\nJust below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water\nvapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric [noctilucent\nclouds](/wiki/Noctilucent_cloud \"Noctilucent cloud\"). These are the highest\nclouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight\nreflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of\ntime before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to\n16 degrees below the horizon. A type of lightning referred to as either\n[sprites](/wiki/Sprite_\\(lightning\\) \"Sprite \\(lightning\\)\") or\n[ELVES](/wiki/ELVES \"ELVES\") occasionally forms far above tropospheric\nthunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most\n[meteors](/wiki/Meteor \"Meteor\") burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too\nhigh above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and\ntoo low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by\n[sounding rockets](/wiki/Sounding_rocket \"Sounding rocket\") and rocket-powered\naircraft.\n\n#### Stratosphere\n\nMain article: [Stratosphere](/wiki/Stratosphere \"Stratosphere\")\n\nThe stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies\nabove the troposphere and is separated from it by the\n[tropopause](/wiki/Tropopause \"Tropopause\"). This layer extends from the top\nof the troposphere at roughly 12 km (7.5 mi; 39,000 ft) above Earth's surface\nto the [stratopause](/wiki/Stratopause \"Stratopause\") at an altitude of about\n50 to 55 km (31 to 34 mi; 164,000 to 180,000 ft).\n\nThe atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the\npressure at [sea level](/wiki/Sea_level_pressure \"Sea level pressure\"). It\ncontains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that\ncontains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines\na layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in\ntemperature is caused by the absorption of [ultraviolet\nradiation](/wiki/Ultraviolet_radiation \"Ultraviolet radiation\") (UV) radiation\nfrom the Sun by the [ozone layer](/wiki/Ozone_layer \"Ozone layer\"), which\nrestricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be −60 °C (−76\n°F; 210 K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and\nmay be near 0 °C.[15]\n\nThe stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric\nconditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence\nthat is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is\nalmost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar\nstratospheric or [nacreous clouds](/wiki/Nacreous_cloud \"Nacreous cloud\") are\noccasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the\nair is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by\njet-powered aircraft.\n\n#### Troposphere\n\nMain article: [Troposphere](/wiki/Troposphere \"Troposphere\")\n\nThe troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from\nEarth's surface to an average height of about 12 km, although this altitude\nactually varies from about 9 km (30,000 ft) at the poles to 17 km (56,000 ft)\nat the [equator](/wiki/Equator \"Equator\"),[11] with some variation due to\nweather. The troposphere is bounded above by the [tropopause](/wiki/Tropopause\n\"Tropopause\"), a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion\n(i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a\nzone which is isothermal with height.[16][17]\n\nAlthough variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing\naltitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through\nenergy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere\n(i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere.\nThis promotes vertical mixing (hence the origin of its name in the Greek word\nτρόπος, _tropos_ , meaning \"turn\"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of\nthe [mass](/wiki/Mass \"Mass\") of Earth's atmosphere.[18] The troposphere is\ndenser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric\nweight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely\ncompressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in\nthe lower 5.6 km (18,000 ft) of the troposphere.\n\nNearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so\nit is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically\nall the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind\ncirculation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the\ntropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most\nconventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the\nonly layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Endeavour_silhouette_STS-130.jpg/220px-\nEndeavour_silhouette_STS-130.jpg)](/wiki/File:Endeavour_silhouette_STS-130.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Endeavour_silhouette_STS-130.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Space Shuttle _Endeavour_](/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour \"Space Shuttle\nEndeavour\") orbiting in the thermosphere. Because of the angle of the photo,\nit appears to straddle the stratosphere and mesosphere that actually lie more\nthan 250 km below. The orange layer is the [troposphere](/wiki/Troposphere\n\"Troposphere\"), which gives way to the whitish\n[stratosphere](/wiki/Stratosphere \"Stratosphere\") and then the blue\n[mesosphere](/wiki/Mesosphere \"Mesosphere\").[19]\n\n### Other layers\n\nWithin the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature,\nseveral secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:\n\n  * The [ozone layer](/wiki/Ozone_layer \"Ozone layer\") is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer [ozone](/wiki/Ozone \"Ozone\") concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about 15–35 km (9.3–21.7 mi; 49,000–115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.\n  * The [ionosphere](/wiki/Ionosphere \"Ionosphere\") is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It is responsible for [auroras](/wiki/Aurora_\\(astronomy\\) \"Aurora \\(astronomy\\)\"). During daytime hours, it stretches from 50 to 1,000 km (31 to 621 mi; 160,000 to 3,280,000 ft) and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere. However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere. The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the [magnetosphere](/wiki/Magnetosphere \"Magnetosphere\"). It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on Earth.\n  * The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence.[20] This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the _[turbopause](/wiki/Turbopause \"Turbopause\")_ found at about 100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the very [edge of space](/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line \"Kármán line\") itself as accepted by the [FAI](/wiki/Federation_Aeronautique_Internationale \"Federation Aeronautique Internationale\"), which places it about 20 km (12 mi; 66,000 ft) above the mesopause.\n\n    Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude. This is because the [distance that particles can move without colliding with one another](/wiki/Mean_free_path \"Mean free path\") is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.[_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_]\n\n  * The [planetary boundary layer](/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer \"Planetary boundary layer\") is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [turbulent diffusion](/wiki/Turbulence \"Turbulence\"). During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about 100 metres (330 ft) on clear, calm nights to 3,000 m (9,800 ft) or more during the afternoon in dry regions.\n\nThe average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is 14 °C (57 °F;\n287 K)[21] or 15 °C (59 °F; 288 K),[22] depending on the\nreference.[23][24][25]\n\n## Physical properties\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Comparison_US_standard_atmosphere_1962.svg/250px-\nComparison_US_standard_atmosphere_1962.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Comparison_US_standard_atmosphere_1962.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Comparison_US_standard_atmosphere_1962.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nComparison of the 1962 [US Standard Atmosphere](/wiki/US_Standard_Atmosphere\n\"US Standard Atmosphere\") graph of [geometric\naltitude](/wiki/Atmospheric_models#Geopotential_altitude \"Atmospheric models\")\nagainst [air density](/wiki/Air_density \"Air density\"),\n[pressure](/wiki/Pressure \"Pressure\"), the [speed of\nsound](/wiki/Speed_of_sound \"Speed of sound\") and\n[temperature](/wiki/Temperature \"Temperature\") with approximate altitudes of\nvarious objects.[26]\n\n### Pressure and thickness\n\nMain article: [Atmospheric pressure](/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure \"Atmospheric\npressure\")\n\nThe average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the [International\nStandard Atmosphere](/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere \"International\nStandard Atmosphere\") as 101325 [pascals](/wiki/Pascal_\\(unit\\) \"Pascal\n\\(unit\\)\") (760.00 [Torr](/wiki/Torr \"Torr\"); 14.6959\n[psi](/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch \"Pounds per square inch\"); 760.00\n[mmHg](/wiki/Millimeter_of_mercury \"Millimeter of mercury\")).

Total atmospheric\nmass is 5.1480×1018 kg (1.135×1019 lb),[27] about 2.5% less than would be\ninferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2\nmegahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain.\nAtmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the\npoint where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location\nand [weather](/wiki/Low-pressure_area \"Low-pressure area\").\n\nIf the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it\nwould terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50 km (27,900 ft). It actually\ndecreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6 km (18,000\nft) or by a factor of 1/[e](/wiki/E_\\(mathematical_constant\\) \"E\n\\(mathematical constant\\)\") every 7.64 km (25,100 ft), the average [scale\nheight](/wiki/Scale_height \"Scale height\") of the atmosphere below 70 km (43\nmi; 230,000 ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a\ncustomized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature,\nmolecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.\n\nIn summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as\nfollows:[28]\n\n  * 50% is below 5.6 km (18,000 ft).\n  * 90% is below 16 km (52,000 ft).\n  * 99.99997% is below 100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the [Kármán line](/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line \"Kármán line\"). By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered [astronauts](/wiki/Astronaut \"Astronaut\").\n\nBy comparison, the summit of Mt.

The various\nlayers of Earth's [ionosphere](/wiki/Ionosphere \"Ionosphere\"), important to\n[HF radio](/wiki/HF_radio \"HF radio\") propagation, begin below 100 km and\nextend beyond 500 km. By comparison, the [International Space\nStation](/wiki/International_Space_Station \"International Space Station\") and\n[Space Shuttle](/wiki/Space_Shuttle \"Space Shuttle\") typically orbit at\n350–400 km, within the [F-layer](/wiki/F-layer \"F-layer\") of the ionosphere\nwhere they encounter enough [atmospheric drag](/wiki/Atmospheric_drag\n\"Atmospheric drag\") to require reboosts every few months.

The\ninstruments record microwaves emitted from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere.\nSource:[29]\n\nThe division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature\nis discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level,\nbut variations in this trend begin above 11 km, where the temperature\nstabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the\ntroposphere. In the [stratosphere](/wiki/Stratosphere \"Stratosphere\"),\nstarting above about 20 km, the temperature increases with height, due to\nheating within the [ozone layer](/wiki/Ozone_layer \"Ozone layer\") caused by\ncapture of significant [ultraviolet](/wiki/Ultraviolet \"Ultraviolet\")\nradiation from the [Sun](/wiki/Sun \"Sun\") by the dioxygen and ozone gas in\nthis region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude\noccurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named\n[thermosphere](/wiki/Thermosphere \"Thermosphere\") above 90 km.\n\nBecause in an [ideal gas](/wiki/Ideal_gas \"Ideal gas\") of constant composition\nthe [speed of sound](/wiki/Speed_of_sound \"Speed of sound\") depends only on\ntemperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the\natmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature\nprofile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal\nchanges in density or pressure.\n\n### Density and mass\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Atmosphere_model.png/220px-\nAtmosphere_model.png)](/wiki/File:Atmosphere_model.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Atmosphere_model.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nTemperature and mass density against altitude from the\n[NRLMSISE-00](/wiki/NRLMSISE-00 \"NRLMSISE-00\") [standard\natmosphere](/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere \"International Standard\nAtmosphere\") model (the eight dotted lines in each \"decade\" are at the eight\ncubes 8, 27, 64, ..., 729)\n\nMain article: [Density of air](/wiki/Density_of_air \"Density of air\")\n\nThe density of air at sea level is about 1.2 kg/m3 (1.2 g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3).\nDensity is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of\ntemperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form\nof the [ideal gas law](/wiki/Ideal_gas_law \"Ideal gas law\")). Atmospheric\ndensity decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be\napproximately modeled using the [barometric formula](/wiki/Barometric_formula\n\"Barometric formula\"). More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital\ndecay of satellites.\n\nThe average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5×1015)\n[tonnes](/wiki/Tonne \"Tonne\") or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to\nthe American [National Center for Atmospheric\nResearch](/wiki/National_Center_for_Atmospheric_Research \"National Center for\nAtmospheric Research\"), \"The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480×1018\nkg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5×1015 kg, depending on\nwhether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than\nthe previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27×1016\nkg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 ±0.0003×1018 kg.\"\n\n## Optical properties\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Earth also emits radiation\nback into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the\nincoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In\nMay 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a\nmillion miles away, were found to be [reflected\nlight](/wiki/Reflection_\\(physics\\) \"Reflection \\(physics\\)\") from [ice\ncrystals](/wiki/Ice_crystals \"Ice crystals\") in the atmosphere.[30][31]\n\n### Scattering\n\nMain article: [Scattering](/wiki/Scattering \"Scattering\")\n\nWhen light passes through Earth's atmosphere, [photons](/wiki/Photon \"Photon\")\ninteract with it through _scattering_. If the light does not interact with the\natmosphere, it is called _direct radiation_ and is what you see if you were to\nlook directly at the Sun. _Indirect radiation_ is light that has been\nscattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an [overcast](/wiki/Overcast\n\"Overcast\") day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation\nreaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a\nphenomenon called [Rayleigh scattering](/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering \"Rayleigh\nscattering\"), shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red)\nwavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue\nlight. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the\nhorizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your\neye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a\nsunset.\n\n### Absorption\n\nMain article: [Absorption (electromagnetic\nradiation)](/wiki/Absorption_\\(electromagnetic_radiation\\) \"Absorption\n\\(electromagnetic radiation\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg/220px-\nAtmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRough plot of Earth's atmospheric [transmittance](/wiki/Transmittance\n\"Transmittance\") (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic\nradiation, including [visible light](/wiki/Visible_light \"Visible light\").\n\nDifferent molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O2\nand O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300\n[nanometers](/wiki/Nanometer \"Nanometer\"). Water (H2O) absorbs many\nwavelengths above 700 nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the\nenergy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also\ncools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.\n\nThe combined [absorption spectra](/wiki/Absorption_spectra \"Absorption\nspectra\") of the gases in the atmosphere leave \"windows\" of low\n[opacity](/wiki/Opacity_\\(optics\\) \"Opacity \\(optics\\)\"), allowing the\ntransmission of only certain bands of light. The [optical\nwindow](/wiki/Optical_window \"Optical window\") runs from around 300 nm\n([ultraviolet](/wiki/Ultraviolet \"Ultraviolet\")-C) up into the range humans\ncan see, the [visible spectrum](/wiki/Visible_spectrum \"Visible spectrum\")\n(commonly called light), at roughly 400–700 nm and continues to the\n[infrared](/wiki/Infrared \"Infrared\") to around 1100 nm. There are also\n[infrared](/wiki/Infrared_window \"Infrared window\") and [radio\nwindows](/wiki/Radio_window \"Radio window\") that transmit some infrared and\n[radio waves](/wiki/Radio_waves \"Radio waves\") at longer wavelengths. For\nexample, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter\nwaves.\n\n### Emission\n\nMain article: [Emission (electromagnetic\nradiation)](/wiki/Emission_\\(electromagnetic_radiation\\) \"Emission\n\\(electromagnetic radiation\\)\")\n\n_Emission_ is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits\nradiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending\non their \"[black body](/wiki/Black_body \"Black body\")\" emission curves,\ntherefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter\nwavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For\nexample, the Sun is approximately 6,000 [K](/wiki/Kelvin \"Kelvin\") (5,730\n[°C](/wiki/Celsius \"Celsius\"); 10,340 [°F](/wiki/Fahrenheit \"Fahrenheit\")),\nits radiation peaks near 500 nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is\napproximately 290 K (17 °C; 62 °F), so its radiation peaks near 10,000 nm, and\nis much too long to be visible to humans.\n\nBecause of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For\nexample, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy\nnights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of\ninfrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher\nelevations.\n\nThe [greenhouse effect](/wiki/Greenhouse_effect \"Greenhouse effect\") is\ndirectly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the\natmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with\nsunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO2 and H2O.\n\n### Refractive index\n\nSee also: [Scintillation (astronomy)](/wiki/Scintillation_\\(astronomy\\)\n\"Scintillation \\(astronomy\\)\")\n\nThe [refractive index](/wiki/Refractive_index \"Refractive index\") of air is\nclose to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index\ncan lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is\nthat, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels\njust over the [horizon](/wiki/Horizon \"Horizon\") because light is refracted in\nthe same direction as the [curvature](/wiki/Curvature \"Curvature\") of Earth's\nsurface.\n\nThe refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction\neffects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is\nthe [mirage](/wiki/Mirage \"Mirage\").\n\n## Circulation\n\nMain article: [Atmospheric circulation](/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation\n\"Atmospheric circulation\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/AtmosphCirc2.png/220px-\nAtmosphCirc2.png)](/wiki/File:AtmosphCirc2.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AtmosphCirc2.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn idealised view of three large circulation cells.\n\n_Atmospheric circulation_ is the large-scale movement of air through the\ntroposphere, and the means (with [ocean circulation](/wiki/Ocean_circulation\n\"Ocean circulation\")) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large-\nscale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but\nthe basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by\nEarth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the\nequator and poles.\n\n## Evolution of Earth's atmosphere\n\nSee also: [History of Earth](/wiki/History_of_Earth \"History of Earth\") and\n[Paleoclimatology](/wiki/Paleoclimatology \"Paleoclimatology\")\n\n### Earliest atmosphere\n\nThe [first atmosphere](/wiki/Paleoatmosphere \"Paleoatmosphere\") consisted of\ngases in the [solar nebula](/wiki/Solar_nebula#Formation_of_planets \"Solar\nnebula\"), primarily [hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen \"Hydrogen\"). There were probably\nsimple hydrides such as those now found in the [gas giants](/wiki/Gas_giant\n\"Gas giant\") ([Jupiter](/wiki/Jupiter \"Jupiter\") and [Saturn](/wiki/Saturn\n\"Saturn\")), notably water vapor, [methane](/wiki/Methane \"Methane\") and\n[ammonia](/wiki/Ammonia \"Ammonia\"). As the solar nebula dissipated, these\ngases escaped, partly driven off by the [solar wind](/wiki/Solar_wind \"Solar\nwind\").[32]\n\n### Second atmosphere\n\nOutgassing from [volcanism](/wiki/Volcanism \"Volcanism\"), supplemented by\ngases produced during the [late heavy\nbombardment](/wiki/Late_heavy_bombardment \"Late heavy bombardment\") of Earth\nby huge [asteroids](/wiki/Asteroids \"Asteroids\"), produced the next\natmosphere, consisting largely of [nitrogen](/wiki/Nitrogen \"Nitrogen\") plus\n[carbon dioxide](/wiki/Carbon_dioxide \"Carbon dioxide\") and inert gases.[32] A\nmajor part of carbon-dioxide emissions soon dissolved in water and built up\ncarbonate sediments.[_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\n\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_]\n\nResearchers have found water-related sediments dating from as early as 3.8\nbillion years ago.[33] About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major\npart of the then stable \"second atmosphere\". An influence of life has to be\ntaken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints\nof early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago.[34] How Earth at\nthat time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the\nearly Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as\nthe \"[faint young Sun paradox](/wiki/Faint_young_Sun_paradox \"Faint young Sun\nparadox\")\".\n\nThe geological record however shows a continually relatively warm surface\nduring the complete early [temperature record](/wiki/Temperature_record\n\"Temperature record\") of Earth - with the exception of one cold glacial phase\nabout 2.4 billion years ago. In the late [Archean](/wiki/Archean \"Archean\")\n[Eon](/wiki/Eon_\\(geology\\) \"Eon \\(geology\\)\") an oxygen-containing atmosphere\nbegan to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing\n[cyanobacteria](/wiki/Cyanobacteria \"Cyanobacteria\") (see [Great Oxygenation\nEvent](/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event \"Great Oxygenation Event\")), which have\nbeen found as [stromatolite](/wiki/Stromatolite \"Stromatolite\") fossils from\n2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy ([isotope\nratio](/wiki/Isotope_ratio \"Isotope ratio\") proportions) strongly suggests\nconditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the\n[carbon cycle](/wiki/Carbon_cycle \"Carbon cycle\") became established as early\nas 4 billion years ago.\n\n[Ancient sediments](/wiki/Proxy_\\(climate\\)#Lake_and_ocean_sediments \"Proxy\n\\(climate\\)\") in the [Gabon](/wiki/Gabon \"Gabon\") dating from between about\n2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic\noxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by\nthe [Lomagundi carbon isotope\nexcursion](/w/index.php?title=Lomagundi_carbon_isotope_excursion&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion \\(page does not exist\\)\").[35]\n\n### Third atmosphere\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Sauerstoffgehalt-1000mj2.png/220px-\nSauerstoffgehalt-1000mj2.png)](/wiki/File:Sauerstoffgehalt-1000mj2.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sauerstoffgehalt-1000mj2.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nOxygen content of the atmosphere over the last billion years[36][37]\n\nThe constant re-arrangement of continents by [plate\ntectonics](/wiki/Plate_tectonics \"Plate tectonics\") influences the long-term\nevolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large\ncontinental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere\nuntil about 2.4 billion years ago during the [Great Oxygenation\nEvent](/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event \"Great Oxygenation Event\") and its\nappearance is indicated by the end of the [banded iron\nformations](/wiki/Banded_iron_formations \"Banded iron formations\").\n\nBefore this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by\noxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not\nstart to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen\nbegan to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen.\nThis point signifies a shift from a [reducing](/wiki/Redox \"Redox\") atmosphere\nto an [oxidizing](/wiki/Oxidizing \"Oxidizing\") atmosphere. O2 showed major\nvariations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the\nPrecambrian.[38] The following time span from 541 million years ago to the\npresent day is the [Phanerozoic](/wiki/Phanerozoic \"Phanerozoic\") Eon, during\nthe earliest period of which, the [Cambrian](/wiki/Cambrian \"Cambrian\"),\noxygen-requiring [metazoan](/wiki/Metazoan \"Metazoan\") life forms began to\nappear.\n\nThe amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600\nmillion years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago,\nsignificantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in\nthe atmosphere: Plants [use carbon dioxide from the\natmosphere](/wiki/Photosynthesis \"Photosynthesis\"), releasing oxygen.\nBreakdown of [pyrite](/wiki/Pyrite \"Pyrite\") and [volcanic\neruptions](/wiki/Volcanic_eruption \"Volcanic eruption\") release\n[sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur \"Sulfur\") into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence\nreduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions\nalso release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact\ncause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known.\nPeriods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid\ndevelopment of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high\nenough for this rapid development of animals.[39]\n\n![File:Watching the Earth\nBreathe.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Watching_the_Earth_Breathe.ogv/220px\n--Watching_the_Earth_Breathe.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Watching_the_Earth_Breathe.ogv\n\"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Watching_the_Earth_Breathe.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\nAnimation shows the buildup of tropospheric CO2 in the Northern Hemisphere\nwith a maximum around May.
