The size of a screen is usually\ndescribed by the length of its [diagonal](/wiki/Diagonal \"Diagonal\"), which is\nthe distance between opposite corners, usually in inches. It is also sometimes\ncalled the **logical image size** to distinguish it from the \"logical image\nsize,\" which describes a screen's [display\nresolution](/wiki/Display_resolution \"Display resolution\") and is measured in\npixels.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Optimal screen size and viewing distance\n  * 2 Display sizes of common TVs and computer monitors\n  * 3 History\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## Optimal screen size and viewing\ndistance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Display_size&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Optimal screen size and viewing distance\")]\n\nThe TV image is composed of many lines of pixels. Ideally, the TV watcher sits\nfar enough away from the screen that the individual lines merge into one solid\nimage. The watcher may sit even farther away and still see a good picture, but\nit will be a smaller portion of their visual field. However, note that viewing\nbehavior is dependent on screen size [1]. With increasing screen sizes visual\nexploration is enhanced with an increased number of fixations of shorter\nduration and a tendency to view only the center of the display.\n\nThe resolution of the human eye (with [20/20 vision](/wiki/20/20_vision \"20/20\nvision\")) is about one [minute of arc](/wiki/Minute_of_arc \"Minute of arc\").\nFor full [HDTV](/wiki/HDTV \"HDTV\") resolution, this one minute of arc implies\nthat the TV watcher should sit **4 times the height of the screen away.** At\nthis distance the individual pixels can not be resolved while simultaneously\nmaximising the viewing area. So the ideal set size can be determined from the\nchart below by measuring the distance from where the watcher would sit to the\nscreen in centimeters (or inches), dividing that by 4, and comparing with the\nscreen heights below. Do not be surprised if the observer can see the pixels\nat this viewing distance as most normal people see far better than 6/6 ([20/20\nvision]). If the user is replacing a standard definition TV with an HDTV this\nimplies that the best visual experience will be with a set that is twice as\ntall as the standard definition set. As the average size LCD TV being sold is\nnow\n38\"[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_], which is only about 15%\ntaller than a 27\" standard definition TV, this means that most consumers buy\nHDTV sets that are smaller than what they could utilize. Cost and budget also\nlimit screen size.\n\n## Display sizes of common TVs and computer\nmonitors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Display_size&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Display sizes of common TVs and computer monitors\")]\n\n[![Display size\nmeasurements.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Display_size_measurements.png/220px-\nDisplay_size_measurements.png)](/wiki/File:Display_size_measurements.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Display_size_measurements.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nKnowing the actual height and width of a screen is useful when deciding which\none to purchase.

History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Display_size&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nThe method of measuring screen size by its diagonal was inherited from the\nmethod used for the first generation of CRT television, when picture tubes\nwith circular faces were in common use. Being circular, the external diameter\nof the bulb was used to describe their size. Since these circular tubes were\nused to display rectangular images, the diagonal measurement of the visible\nrectangle was smaller than the diameter of the tube due to the thickness of\nthe glass surrounding the phosphor screen (which was hidden from the viewer by\nthe casing and bezel). This method continued even when cathode ray tubes were\nmanufactured as rounded rectangles; it had the advantage of being a single\nnumber specifying the size, and was not confusing when the aspect ratio was\nuniversally 4:3. In the US, when virtually all TV tubes were 4:3, the size of\nthe screen was given as the true screen diagonal with a V following it (this\nwas a requirement in the US market but not elsewhere). In virtually all other\nmarkets, the size of the outer diameter of the tube was given. What was a 27V\nin the US could be a 28\" elsewhere. However the V terminology was frequently\ndropped in US advertising referring to a 27V as a 27\". This was not misleading\nfor the consumer as the seller had to give the actual screen size by law.\n[Flat panel displays](/wiki/Flat_panel_display \"Flat panel display\") by\ncontrast use the actual diagonal of their visible display size, thus the size\nis the actual size presented to the viewer in all markets. This means that a\nsimilarly specified size of display will be larger as a flat panel display\ncompared with a cathode ray tube display.\n\nWhen the common aspect ratio went from 4:3 to 16:9, the new widescreens were\nlabeled with a W in the US. A screen that is approximately the same height as\na 27V would be a 32W. Vizio and other US TV manufacturers have introduced even\nwider screens with a 21:9 aspect ratio in order to match aspect ratios used in\ncinemas. In order to gauge the relative sizes of these new screens, the screen\naspect must be considered. In a commercial market where multiple aspect ratios\nare being sold, it will always take two numbers to describe the screen size,\nsome combination of diagonal, aspect ratio, height or width.\n\nSet sizes are frequently given as a \"class\" as screens from different\nmanufacturers will have slight differences in size. However the \"class\" should\nbe within 1/2\" of the actual size. The reasons for the different sizes within\na class stem from differences in the manufacturers' equipment. As\nmanufacturers move from one size to another, newer larger sizes must fit on\nthe same size glass, though with fewer displays being cut from it. Some sizes\nfit well and maximize glass utilization, other sizes fit more poorly and waste\nglass. As an example, in some cases, increasing the screen size by even 0.1\"\ncan cause an LCD manufacturer to go from 12 screens fitting on their glass\nsheet to 9. This would make them uncompetitive with other screen makers.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Display_size&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Display resolution](/wiki/Display_resolution \"Display resolution\")\n  * [Computer display standard](/wiki/Computer_display_standard \"Computer display standard\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Display_size&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Ramos Gameiro, R; Kaspar, K; König, SU; Nordholt, S; König, P (2017). \"Exploration and exploitation in natural viewing behavior\". _Sci Rep_. **7** : 2311.
