The show, narrated by [Future Ted](/wiki/Future_Ted\n\"Future Ted\"), tells the story of how [Ted Mosby](/wiki/Ted_Mosby \"Ted Mosby\")\nmet The Mother. Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from \"[Lucky\nPenny](/wiki/Lucky_Penny \"Lucky Penny\")\" to \"[The Time\nTravelers](/wiki/The_Time_Travelers_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\) \"The Time\nTravelers \\(How I Met Your Mother\\)\")\" as an [unseen\ncharacter](/wiki/Unseen_character \"Unseen character\"); she was first seen\nfully in \"[Something New](/wiki/Something_New_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\)\n\"Something New \\(How I Met Your Mother\\)\")\" and was promoted to a main\ncharacter in [season 9](/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother_\\(season_9\\) \"How I Met\nYour Mother \\(season 9\\)\"). The Mother is played by [Cristin\nMilioti](/wiki/Cristin_Milioti \"Cristin Milioti\").\n\nThe story of how Ted met The Mother is the [framing\ndevice](/wiki/Framing_device \"Framing device\") behind the series; many facts\nabout her are revealed throughout the series, including the fact that Ted once\nunwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her\napartment. Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following\n[Barney Stinson](/wiki/Barney_Stinson \"Barney Stinson\") and [Robin\nScherbatsky](/wiki/Robin_Scherbatsky \"Robin Scherbatsky\")'s wedding; this\nscene is shown in \"[Last Forever](/wiki/Last_Forever \"Last Forever\")\", the\nseries finale. The Mother's death from an unspecified [terminal\nillness](/wiki/Terminal_illness \"Terminal illness\") in 2024, also revealed in\nthe series finale, received a mixed reaction from fans.\n\nAn alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD. In the alternate\nending, Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in\n2030.[1][2] In the video, future Ted is heard saying, \"...When I think how\nlucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning, I can't help but be\namazed how easy it all really was...\", indirectly stating that The Mother is\nalive. The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and\ncredits start rolling, implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived\na successful married life with Tracy Mosby.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Casting\n  * 2 Character history\n    * 2.1 Name\n  * 3 Death\n  * 4 Notes\n  * 5 References\n\n##\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mother_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\nDuring its first eight seasons, the successful sitcom _[How I Met Your\nMother](/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother \"How I Met Your Mother\")_ often hinted at\nthe [unseen character](/wiki/Unseen_character \"Unseen character\") of The\nMother. Well-known actresses often made guest appearances on the show. Many\nfans expected that another would play one of the most-wanted roles in\nHollywood, but creators [Carter Bays](/wiki/Carter_Bays \"Carter Bays\") and\n[Craig Thomas](/wiki/Craig_Thomas_\\(screenwriter\\) \"Craig Thomas\n\\(screenwriter\\)\") wanted an unknown. Using [Anne\nHathaway](/wiki/Anne_Hathaway \"Anne Hathaway\") and [Amy Adams](/wiki/Amy_Adams\n\"Amy Adams\") as examples, Thomas said that \"We didn’t want it to be a big\nfamous star because we didn’t want the wider audience to have associations\nwith whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted’s never\nseen this woman before, so it better feel that way to the audience\", similar\nto how [Cobie Smulders](/wiki/Cobie_Smulders \"Cobie Smulders\") being cast as\n[Robin Scherbatsky](/wiki/Robin_Scherbatsky \"Robin Scherbatsky\") had \"kept the\nshow alive\" when it began. Bays and Thomas also did not want a large [casting\ncall](/wiki/Casting_call \"Casting call\").[4][5]\n\nThey chose [Cristin Milioti](/wiki/Cristin_Milioti \"Cristin Milioti\") after\n[seeing her on _30 Rock_](/wiki/TGS_Hates_Women \"TGS Hates Women\") and\n_[Once](/wiki/Once_\\(musical\\) \"Once \\(musical\\)\")_ ; her musical ability was\nalso helpful, as The Mother had been described as a band member. After\ncompeting for the role against at least two others, Milioti filmed her first\nscene—for [the last episode of season\n8](/wiki/Something_New_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\) \"Something New \\(How I Met\nYour Mother\\)\")—having never watched _How I Met Your Mother_ ; she recalled,\n\"I had ignorance on my side. So I didn’t know what it meant.\" Milioti learned\nof the character's importance only after [binge watching](/wiki/Binge_watching\n\"Binge watching\") the show during the summer.[5][6]\n\n## Character\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mother_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Character history\")]\n\nThe Mother was born on September 19, 1984.[note 1]\n\nThe Mother, joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend\nMax only to receive a call informing her of his death. After the funeral\nservice, she returns to the apartment to open Max's last gift to her — a\nukulele. The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man\nshe believes was her one true love.[7]\n\nIn \"[Wait for It](/wiki/Wait_for_It_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother_episode\\) \"Wait\nfor It \\(How I Met Your Mother episode\\)\")\", it is revealed that the short\nstory of how they met involved her yellow umbrella. In \"[No\nTomorrow](/wiki/No_Tomorrow_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\) \"No Tomorrow \\(How I Met\nYour Mother\\)\")\", Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after\nattending a [St. Patrick's Day](/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_Day \"St. Patrick's Day\")\nparty which she also attended, as it had been two and a half years since the\ndeath of Max, her late boyfriend. She is still grieving, but her roommate\nKelly encourages her to go out and date again, bringing her to the same bar\nwhere Ted and [Barney](/wiki/Barney_Stinson \"Barney Stinson\") are celebrating.\nThe two women run into Mitch, her old orchestra instructor; The Mother offers\nto give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her\napartment. After they start talking, Mitch encourages her to pursue her\ndreams. The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics\nin college.[7]\n\nOn his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby, as seen in the season 4\nfinale \"[The Leap](/wiki/The_Leap_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\) \"The Leap \\(How I\nMet Your Mother\\)\")\", he is seen in front of the classroom of students, one of\nwhich Future Ted says is the titular mother. But in the first episode of\nseason 5, \"[Definitions](/wiki/Definitions_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\)\n\"Definitions \\(How I Met Your Mother\\)\")\", it is revealed that he was actually\nin the wrong classroom — Economics instead of Architecture. At the same time\nin \"[How Your Mother Met Me](/wiki/How_Your_Mother_Met_Me \"How Your Mother Met\nMe\")\", the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another\ngraduate student named [Cindy](/wiki/Cindy_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother_character\\)\n\"Cindy \\(How I Met Your Mother character\\)\") ([Rachel\nBilson](/wiki/Rachel_Bilson \"Rachel Bilson\")), whom she offers to move in with\nher as her roommate. They see Ted enter the room, but when he announces the\nsubject, The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off. She heads\nback to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom.\n\nLater, in \"[Girls Versus Suits](/wiki/Girls_Versus_Suits \"Girls Versus\nSuits\")\", Ted dates Cindy, not knowing that her roommate is his future wife.\nThroughout the episode, Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first\ndate talking jealously about her roommate. When in Cindy and the mother's\napartment he picks up many of The Mother's belongings, attempting to show how\ncompatible he and Cindy are (thinking the items are Cindy's) and glimpses the\nmother's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower. Ted finds\nout at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band. Ted forgets to take the\nyellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions, \"this is\nhow your mother got her yellow umbrella back.\" In \"[How Your Mother Met\nMe](/wiki/How_Your_Mother_Met_Me \"How Your Mother Met Me\")\", it is revealed\nthat, after Ted left the apartment, the Mother had discovered the umbrella\nand, upon going to question Cindy, finds her in a state. As she tried to\nconsole her, Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted, and began to\nlovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive,\nbefore spontaneously kissing her, revealing that her jealousy towards her\nroommate was actually a crush. While this incident made Cindy realise that she\nis a [lesbian](/wiki/Lesbian \"Lesbian\"), it also made the Mother decide to go\nback into dating, as the kiss was her first in a long time.\n\nSome time after this, a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed\ninto her band named Superfreakonomics. Darren gradually takes over the\nband.[7]\n\nIn the season 6 opener \"[Big Days](/wiki/Big_Days \"Big Days\")\" it is revealed\nTed meets his future wife \"the day of\" the wedding at which he is the best\nman. In the episode \"[False\nPositive](/wiki/False_Positive_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\) \"False Positive \\(How\nI Met Your Mother\\)\")\" Robin asks Ted to be her future best man, should she\never get married. In the episode \"[Challenge\nAccepted](/wiki/Challenge_Accepted \"Challenge Accepted\")\", it is revealed that\nTed meets the mother of his children the day of Barney's wedding. In the last\nepisode of season 7, \"[The Magician's Code](/wiki/The_Magician%27s_Code \"The\nMagician's Code\")\" it is shown that Barney will marry Robin, and Ted will meet\nthe mother \"the day of\" their wedding. On the premiere of season 8, Ted's wife\nappears after Barney and Robin's wedding, outside at the\n\"[Farhampton](/wiki/Farhampton \"Farhampton\")\" station while holding a yellow\numbrella and her bass guitar.\n\nIn the season 8 episode \"[Band or DJ?](/wiki/Band_or_DJ%3F \"Band or DJ?\"),\"\nTed runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin\nhired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute. The end result of\nthe encounter is that Cindy's (now ex-) roommate's band plays at Barney and\nRobin's wedding.\n\nThe Mother is first shown meeting Louis in \"[How Your Mother Met\nMe](/wiki/How_Your_Mother_Met_Me \"How Your Mother Met Me\")\" as she is left to\ncarry the band equipment while the now-lead band member Darren talks to his\nfans. Later at MacLaren's Pub, she tells him she's not yet ready to date.\nLouis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin\ndating not long after.\n\nThe Mother meets all of Ted's best friends (Barney, Lily, Marshall and Robin)\nbefore she meets him. The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to\npursue Robin, as revealed through a flashback in \"[Platonish](/wiki/Platonish\n\"Platonish\")\". In \"[The Locket](/wiki/The_Locket_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\)\n\"The Locket \\(How I Met Your Mother\\)\")\", Tracy meets Lily on a train journey.\n\nIn \"[Bass Player Wanted](/wiki/Bass_Player_Wanted \"Bass Player Wanted\")\", the\nMother picks up a hitchhiking [Marshall](/wiki/Marshall_Eriksen \"Marshall\nEriksen\"), carrying his son Marvin, on her way to Farhampton Inn. On their\nway, it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band, that is\nscheduled to play at the wedding reception. But the band's leader, Darren,\nforced her to quit. The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and\nretake the band. She ends up alone at the bar, and while practicing a speech\nto give Darren, Darren walks up to her furious the groom's best man punched\nhim for \"no reason.\" Amused by this, the Mother laughs, and Darren quits the\nband in anger.\n\nIn \"[How Your Mother Met Me](/wiki/How_Your_Mother_Met_Me \"How Your Mother Met\nMe\")\", it is shown that after this incident, the Mother returns to Louis'\nsummer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for\nthe duration of the wedding weekend. As she walks in the door, Louis proposes\nto her, but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes. She declines\nLouis' proposal and leaves his cottage, going to check in at Farhampton Inn.\nOn her room's balcony, she plays the ukulele and sings \"[La Vie en\nRose](/wiki/La_Vie_en_Rose \"La Vie en Rose\")\". Ted hears her singing from his\nroom next door.\n\nIn \"[Gary Blauman](/wiki/Gary_Blauman \"Gary Blauman\")\", Ted and the Mother are\non their first date. Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they\nproceed to walk to a Scottish-Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner. On the way\nthere, Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run-in with Louis.\nShe says that she is in the \"weirdest place on earth\" right now and that it is\ntoo soon for her to be dating. Ted walks her back to her apartment. They say\ngoodnight and Ted begins to walk away. The Mother then stops him and asks him\nto finish the story he was telling her. When the story is over, they say\ngoodnight again. The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the\nfirst time, before deciding to carry on their date.\n\nIn a flashforward in \"[The\nLighthouse](/wiki/The_Lighthouse_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\) \"The Lighthouse\n\\(How I Met Your Mother\\)\")\", Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the\nlighthouse near Farhampton Inn. She immediately accepts. In another\nflashfoward in \"[Unpause](/wiki/Unpause \"Unpause\")\", the Mother is revealed to\nbe pregnant with their second child, Luke, in the year 2017. She goes into\nlabor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton.\n\n###\nName[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mother_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Name\")]\n\nThe Mother's real name is not revealed until the series finale, \"[Last\nForever](/wiki/Last_Forever \"Last Forever\")\". When Ted meets her at the\nFarhampton train station, she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell. In the\nseason 1 episode \"[Belly Full of Turkey](/wiki/Belly_Full_of_Turkey \"Belly\nFull of Turkey\")\", Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says \"...that, kids,\nis the true story of how I met your mother\". The children react in surprise\nand appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking,[9] which led some\nfans to correctly guess that The Mother's name is Tracy.[10]\n\n##\nDeath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mother_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Death\")]\n\nSee also: [Last Forever](/wiki/Last_Forever \"Last Forever\")\n\nIn the series finale, it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the\nstory to his children, Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness. In the\nfinale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead. Ted says\nthat she \"became sick\" and his children saying that she has been \"gone\" for\nsix years. Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother's\ndeath.[11] Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die,\nbut came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the\nbeginning.[12] Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was \"an\namazing character\"[9] and that \"over the course of this final season _HIMYM_\nmade us care about Tracy.[13] Kuchman said that \"asking fans to drop all of\nthat with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a\nvery difficult request\", that the finale \"advanced too quickly\" and that\n\"_HIMYM_ was a victim of its own success on this issue\".[9]\n\nA petition was started, aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale. The petition\nhas over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage.[14][15] On\nApril 5, 2014, Carter Bays announced on [Twitter](/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\")\nthat an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD. No new\nmaterial was shot for this scene.[16][17] In the alternate ending, the mother\nis still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030.[18][1]\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mother_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that \"[Pilot](/wiki/Pilot_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\) \"Pilot \\(How I Met Your Mother\\)\")\" is set.[7] The pilot is set on September 19, 2005.[8]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mother_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Debnath, Neela (7 September 2014).
