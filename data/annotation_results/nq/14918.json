the **Resistance War Against America**\n([Vietnamese](/wiki/Vietnamese_language \"Vietnamese language\"): _Kháng chiến\nchống Mỹ_) or simply the **American War** , was a conflict that occurred in\n[Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam \"Vietnam\"), [Laos](/wiki/Laos \"Laos\"), and\n[Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia \"Cambodia\") from 1 November 1955[A 1] to the [fall\nof Saigon](/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon \"Fall of Saigon\") on 30 April 1975. It was the\nsecond of the [Indochina Wars](/wiki/Indochina_Wars \"Indochina Wars\") and was\nofficially fought between [North Vietnam](/wiki/North_Vietnam \"North Vietnam\")\nand the government of [South Vietnam](/wiki/South_Vietnam \"South Vietnam\").\nThe North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union, China,[29] and\nother communist allies; the South Vietnamese army was supported by the United\nStates, South Korea, Australia, Thailand and other [anti-\ncommunist](/wiki/Anti-communism \"Anti-communism\")\n[allies](/wiki/Free_World_Military_Forces \"Free World Military Forces\").[77]\nThe war is considered a [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\")-era [proxy\nwar](/wiki/Proxy_war \"Proxy war\") by some US perspectives.[78] The war would\nlast approximately 19 years and would also form the [Laotian Civil\nWar](/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War \"Laotian Civil War\") as well as the [Cambodian\nCivil War](/wiki/Cambodian_Civil_War \"Cambodian Civil War\"), which resulted in\nall 3 countries becoming communist states in 1975.\n\nThere are several competing views on the conflict. Some on the [North\nVietnamese](/wiki/North_Vietnam \"North Vietnam\") and [National Liberation\nFront](/wiki/Viet_Cong \"Viet Cong\") side view the struggle against U.S. forces\nas a [colonial war](/wiki/Colonial_war \"Colonial war\") and a continuation of\nthe [First Indochina War](/wiki/First_Indochina_War \"First Indochina War\")\nagainst forces from France and later on the United States,[79] especially in\nlight of the failed [1954 Geneva Conference](/wiki/1954_Geneva_Conference\n\"1954 Geneva Conference\") calls for elections. Other interpretations of the\nNorth Vietnamese side include viewing it as a [civil war](/wiki/Civil_war\n\"Civil war\"), especially in the early and later phases following the U.S.\ninterlude between 1965 and 1970,[80] as well as a war of liberation.[79] In\nthe perspective of some, the [Provisional Revolutionary Government of the\nRepublic of South\nVietnam](/wiki/Provisional_Revolutionary_Government_of_the_Republic_of_South_Vietnam\n\"Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam\"), the\nsuccessor to the Việt Cộng, was motivated in part by significant social\nchanges in the [post-World War II](/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_II \"Aftermath\nof World War II\") Vietnam, and had initially seen it as a [revolutionary\nwar](/wiki/Revolution \"Revolution\") supported by Hanoi.[81][82] The pro-\ngovernment side in [South Vietnam](/wiki/South_Vietnam \"South Vietnam\") viewed\nit as a civil war, a defensive war against communism,[80][83] or were\nmotivated to fight to defend their homes and families.[84] The U.S. government\nviewed its involvement in the war as a way to prevent a communist takeover of\nSouth Vietnam. This was part of the [domino theory](/wiki/Domino_theory\n\"Domino theory\") of a wider [containment](/wiki/Containment \"Containment\")\npolicy, with the stated aim of stopping the spread of communism.[85]\n\nBeginning in 1950, American [military advisors](/wiki/Military_advisor\n\"Military advisor\") arrived in what was then [French\nIndochina](/wiki/French_Indochina \"French Indochina\").[86][A 3] Most of the\nfunding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S.[87] The [Việt\nCộng](/wiki/Viet_Cong \"Viet Cong\"), also known as _Front national de\nlibération du Sud-Viêt Nam_ or _FNL_ (the National Liberation Front), a South\nVietnamese communist [common front](/wiki/Common_front \"Common front\") aided\nby the North, fought a [guerrilla war](/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare \"Guerrilla\nwarfare\") against anti-communist forces in the region, while the [People's\nArmy of Vietnam](/wiki/People%27s_Army_of_Vietnam \"People's Army of Vietnam\"),\nalso known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), engaged in more [conventional\nwarfare](/wiki/Conventional_warfare \"Conventional warfare\"), and had launched\narmed struggles from 1959 onward. U.S. involvement escalated in 1960 under\nPresident [John F. Kennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F. Kennedy\"), with\ntroop levels gradually surging under the\n[MAAG](/wiki/Military_Assistance_Advisory_Group \"Military Assistance Advisory\nGroup\") program from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963.[88][89]\n\nBy 1964 there were 23,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, but this escalated further\nfollowing the 1964 [Gulf of Tonkin incident](/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident\n\"Gulf of Tonkin incident\"), in which a U.S. destroyer was alleged to have\nclashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. In response the [Gulf of\nTonkin Resolution](/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_Resolution \"Gulf of Tonkin\nResolution\") gave [Lyndon B. Johnson](/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson \"Lyndon B.\nJohnson\") authorization to increase U.S. military presence, deploying ground\n[combat units](/wiki/Military_organization \"Military organization\") for the\nfirst time and increasing troop levels to 184,000.[88] Every year onward there\nwas significant build-up despite little progress, with [Robert\nMcNamara](/wiki/Robert_McNamara \"Robert McNamara\"), one of the principal\narchitects of the war, beginning to express doubts of victory by the end of\n1966.[90] U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on [air\nsuperiority](/wiki/Air_supremacy \"Air supremacy\") and overwhelming firepower\nto conduct [search and destroy](/wiki/Search_and_destroy \"Search and destroy\")\noperations, involving [ground forces](/wiki/Army \"Army\"),\n[artillery](/wiki/Artillery \"Artillery\"), and [airstrikes](/wiki/Airstrike\n\"Airstrike\"). The U.S. conducted a large-scale [strategic\nbombing](/wiki/Strategic_bombing \"Strategic bombing\") campaign against North\nVietnam. Following the Tết Offensive, U.S. forces began withdrawal under the\n[Vietnamization](/wiki/Vietnamization \"Vietnamization\") phase; the [Army of\nthe Republic of Vietnam](/wiki/Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam \"Army of the\nRepublic of Vietnam\") unconventional and conventional capabilities increased\nfollowing a period of neglect and became modeled on heavy fire-power focused\ndoctrines like US forces. Operations crossed international borders: bordering\nareas of Laos and Cambodia were used by North Vietnam as supply routes and\nwere heavily bombed by U.S. forces.\n\nGradual withdrawal of U.S. ground forces began as part of\n\"[Vietnamization](/wiki/Vietnamization \"Vietnamization\")\", which aimed to end\nAmerican involvement in the war while transferring the task of fighting the\ncommunists to the South Vietnamese themselves and begun the task of\nmodernizing their armed forces. Morale declined significantly among U.S.\nforces during the wind-down period and incidents of [fragging](/wiki/Fragging\n\"Fragging\"), drug-use and [insubordination](/wiki/Insubordination\n\"Insubordination\") increased[91] with General [Creighton\nAbrams](/wiki/Creighton_Abrams \"Creighton Abrams\") remarking \"I need to get\nthis army home to save it\".[92] From 1969 onwards the military actions of the\nViệt Cộng insurgency decreased as the role and engagement of the NVA grew.\nInitially fielding less conventional and poorer weaponry, from 1970 onward the\n[People's Army of Vietnam](/wiki/People%27s_Army_of_Vietnam \"People's Army of\nVietnam\") and its branch [People's Liberation Armed Forces of South\nVietnam](/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Armed_Forces_of_South_Vietnam \"People's\nLiberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam\") had increasingly became mechanised\nand armoured, capable of modernised [combined arms](/wiki/Combined_arms\n\"Combined arms\") and mobile warfare and begun to widely deploy newer, untested\nweapons.[93] These two sides would see significant, rapid changes throughout\nits lifetime from their original post-colonial armies, and by mid-1970s the\nARVN became the fourth largest army[94] with the PAVN became the fifth largest\narmy in the world[95] in two countries with a population of roughly 20 million\neach.[96]\n\nDespite the [Paris Peace Accord](/wiki/Paris_Peace_Accord \"Paris Peace\nAccord\"), which was signed by all parties in January 1973, [the fighting\ncontinued](/wiki/War_of_the_flags \"War of the flags\") in which both Saigon and\nHanoi attempted to take territory before and after the accord and the\nceasefire was broken just days after its signing.[97] In the U.S. and the\nWestern world, a large [anti-Vietnam War\nmovement](/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War\n\"Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War\") developed as\npart of a larger [counterculture](/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s\n\"Counterculture of the 1960s\"), the largest such anti-war movement up to that\npoint in history.[98] The war changed the dynamics between the\n[Eastern](/wiki/Eastern_Bloc \"Eastern Bloc\") and [Western\nBlocs](/wiki/Western_Bloc \"Western Bloc\"), and altered [North–South\nrelations](/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide \"North–South divide\"),[99] and had\nsignificantly influenced the political landscape in the United States,[100]\nacross much of Western Europe[101] and U.S. ground-force intervention spurred\nthe rise of transnational political movements and campaigning.[102]\n\nDirect U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973 as a result of the\n[Case–Church Amendment](/wiki/Case%E2%80%93Church_Amendment \"Case–Church\nAmendment\") passed by the U.S. Congress.[103] The [capture of\nSaigon](/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon \"Fall of Saigon\") by the North Vietnamese Army in\nApril 1975 marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were\nreunified the following year. The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of\nfatalities (see [Vietnam War casualties](/wiki/Vietnam_War_casualties \"Vietnam\nWar casualties\")). Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and\ncivilians killed vary from 966,000[43] to 3.8 million.[72] Some\n275,000–310,000 [Cambodians](/wiki/Khmer_people \"Khmer people\"),[73][74][75]\n20,000–62,000 [Laotians](/wiki/Lao_people \"Lao people\"),[72] and 58,220 U.S.\nservice members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing\nin action.[A 2] The [Sino-Soviet split](/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split \"Sino-Soviet\nsplit\") re-emerged following the lull during the Vietnam War and ties between\nthe DRV and its Cambodian allies in the [Royal Government of the National\nUnion of Kampuchea](/wiki/GRUNK \"GRUNK\"), the newly-formed [Democratic\nKampuchea](/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea \"Democratic Kampuchea\") begun almost\nimmediately in a series of border raids by the [Khmer Rouge](/wiki/Khmer_Rouge\n\"Khmer Rouge\") and erupted into the [Cambodian–Vietnamese\nWar](/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War \"Cambodian–Vietnamese War\"), with\n[Chinese forces](/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army \"People's Liberation Army\")\ndirectly intervening in the [Sino-Vietnamese War](/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War\n\"Sino-Vietnamese War\"). The end of the war and resumption of the [Third\nIndochina War](/wiki/Third_Indochina_War \"Third Indochina War\") would\nprecipitate the [Vietnamese boat people](/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people\n\"Vietnamese boat people\") and the bigger [Indochina refugee\ncrisis](/wiki/Indochina_refugee_crisis \"Indochina refugee crisis\"), which saw\nan estimated 250,000 people perish at sea.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Names for the war\n  * 2 Background\n  * 3 Transition period\n  * 4 Diệm era, 1954–63\n    * 4.1 Rule\n    * 4.2 Insurgency in the South, 1954–60\n      * 4.2.1 North Vietnamese involvement\n  * 5 Kennedy's escalation, 1961–63\n    * 5.1 Ousting and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm\n  * 6 Johnson's escalation, 1963–69\n    * 6.1 Gulf of Tonkin incident\n    * 6.2 Bombing of Laos\n    * 6.3 The 1964 Offensive\n    * 6.4 American ground war\n    * 6.5 Tet Offensive\n  * 7 Nixon Doctrine and Vietnamization, 1969–72\n    * 7.1 Nuclear threats and diplomacy\n    * 7.2 Hanoi's war strategy\n    * 7.3 U.S. domestic controversies\n    * 7.4 Collapsing U.S. morale\n    * 7.5 ARVN taking the lead and U.S. ground-force withdrawal\n    * 7.6 Cambodia\n    * 7.7 Laos\n    * 7.8 Easter Offensive and Paris Peace Accords, 1972\n  * 8 U.S. exit and final campaigns, 1973–75\n    * 8.1 Campaign 275\n    * 8.2 Final North Vietnamese offensive\n    * 8.3 Fall of Saigon\n  * 9 Opposition to U.S. involvement in the war, 1964–73\n  * 10 Involvement of other countries\n    * 10.1 Pro-Hanoi\n      * 10.1.1 China\n      * 10.1.2 Soviet Union\n      * 10.1.3 Czechoslovakia\n      * 10.1.4 North Korea\n      * 10.1.5 Cuba\n      * 10.1.6 East Germany\n      * 10.1.7 Poland\n    * 10.2 Pro-Saigon\n      * 10.2.1 South Korea\n      * 10.2.2 Thailand\n      * 10.2.3 Australia and New Zealand\n      * 10.2.4 Philippines\n      * 10.2.5 Taiwan\n      * 10.2.6 Brazil\n    * 10.3 Neutral and non-belligerent nations\n      * 10.3.1 Canada and the ICC\n  * 11 United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (FULRO)\n  * 12 War crimes\n    * 12.1 Allied war crimes\n    * 12.2 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong war crimes\n  * 13 Women in the Vietnam War\n    * 13.1 American nurses\n    * 13.2 Vietnamese women\n    * 13.3 Female journalists\n  * 14 Black servicemen in Vietnam\n  * 15 Weapons\n    * 15.1 Radio communications\n    * 15.2 Extent of U.S. bombings\n  * 16 Aftermath\n    * 16.1 Events in Southeast Asia\n    * 16.2 Effect on the United States\n      * 16.2.1 Views on the war\n      * 16.2.2 Cost of the war\n      * 16.2.3 Impact on the U.S. military\n    * 16.3 Effects of U.S. chemical defoliation\n    * 16.4 Casualties\n    * 16.5 In popular culture\n      * 16.5.1 Myths\n    * 16.6 Commemoration\n  * 17 See also\n  * 18 Annotations\n  * 19 Notes\n  * 20 References\n    * 20.1 Secondary sources\n    * 20.2 Primary sources\n    * 20.3 Historiography\n  * 21 External links\n\n## Names for the war\n\nFurther information: [Terminology of the Vietnam\nWar](/wiki/Terminology_of_the_Vietnam_War \"Terminology of the Vietnam War\")\n\nVarious names have been applied to the conflict. _Vietnam War_ is the most\ncommonly used name in English. It has also been called the _Second Indochina\nWar_[76] and the _Vietnam Conflict_.\n\nAs there have been several conflicts in Indochina, this particular conflict is\nknown by the names of its primary protagonists to distinguish it from\nothers.[104] In [Vietnamese](/wiki/Vietnamese_language \"Vietnamese language\"),\nthe war is generally known as _Kháng chiến chống Mỹ_ (Resistance War Against\nAmerica),[105] but less formally as 'Cuộc chiến tranh Mỹ' (The American War).\nIt is also called _Chiến tranh Việt Nam_ (The Vietnam War).[106]\n\n## Background\n\nSee also: [History of Vietnam](/wiki/History_of_Vietnam \"History of Vietnam\"),\n[Cochinchina Campaign](/wiki/Cochinchina_Campaign \"Cochinchina Campaign\"),\n[Cần Vương](/wiki/C%E1%BA%A7n_V%C6%B0%C6%A1ng \"Cần Vương\"), [Việt Nam Quốc Dân\nĐảng](/wiki/Vi%E1%BB%87t_Nam_Qu%E1%BB%91c_D%C3%A2n_%C4%90%E1%BA%A3ng \"Việt Nam\nQuốc Dân Đảng\"), [Yên Bái mutiny](/wiki/Y%C3%AAn_B%C3%A1i_mutiny \"Yên Bái\nmutiny\"), [Vietnam during World War II](/wiki/Vietnam_during_World_War_II\n\"Vietnam during World War II\"), [War in Vietnam\n(1945–46)](/wiki/War_in_Vietnam_\\(1945%E2%80%9346\\) \"War in Vietnam\n\\(1945–46\\)\"), [1940–46 in the Vietnam\nWar](/wiki/1940%E2%80%9346_in_the_Vietnam_War \"1940–46 in the Vietnam War\"),\n[1947–50 in the Vietnam War](/wiki/1947%E2%80%9350_in_the_Vietnam_War \"1947–50\nin the Vietnam War\"), [First Indochina War](/wiki/First_Indochina_War \"First\nIndochina War\"), [Operation Vulture](/wiki/Operation_Vulture \"Operation\nVulture\"), [Operation Passage to Freedom](/wiki/Operation_Passage_to_Freedom\n\"Operation Passage to Freedom\"), and [1954 in the Vietnam\nWar](/wiki/1954_in_the_Vietnam_War \"1954 in the Vietnam War\")\n\nThe primary military organizations involved in the war were, on one side, the\n[Army of the Republic of Vietnam](/wiki/Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam \"Army\nof the Republic of Vietnam\") (ARVN) and the [United States armed\nforces](/wiki/United_States_armed_forces \"United States armed forces\"), and,\non the other side, the [People's Army of\nVietnam](/wiki/People%27s_Army_of_Vietnam \"People's Army of Vietnam\") (PAVN)\n(more commonly called the North Vietnamese Army, or NVA, in English-language\nsources), and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF,\nmore commonly known as the [Viet Cong](/wiki/Viet_Cong \"Viet Cong\") in English\nlanguage sources), a South Vietnamese communist guerrilla force.[107]\n\n[Daniel Ellsberg](/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg \"Daniel Ellsberg\") contends that U.S.\nparticipation in Vietnam had begun in 1945 when it gave support to a French\neffort to reconquer its colony in Vietnam, a nation which had just declared\nindependence in August 1945.[108]\n\nIndochina was a [French colony](/wiki/French_Indochina \"French Indochina\")\nduring the 19th century. When the Japanese invaded during [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the [Viet Minh](/wiki/Viet_Minh \"Viet\nMinh\") opposed them with support from the US, the Soviet Union and China. They\nreceived some Japanese arms when Japan surrendered. The Viet Minh, a\nCommunist-led common front under the leadership of [Ho Chi\nMinh](/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh \"Ho Chi Minh\"), then initiated an insurgency against\nFrench rule. Hostilities escalated into the [First Indochina\nWar](/wiki/First_Indochina_War \"First Indochina War\") (beginning in December\n1946). By the 1950s, the conflict had become entwined with the Cold War. In\nJanuary 1950, China and the Soviet Union recognized the Viet Minh's\n[Democratic Republic of Vietnam](/wiki/North_Vietnam \"North Vietnam\"), based\nin [Hanoi](/wiki/Hanoi \"Hanoi\"), as the legitimate government of Vietnam. The\nfollowing month the United States and Great Britain recognized the French-\nbacked [State of Vietnam](/wiki/State_of_Vietnam \"State of Vietnam\") in\n[Saigon](/wiki/Saigon \"Saigon\"), led by former Emperor [Bảo\nĐại](/wiki/B%E1%BA%A3o_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i \"Bảo Đại\"), as the legitimate\nVietnamese government.[109][110] The outbreak of the [Korean\nWar](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\") in June 1950 convinced many Washington\npolicymakers that the war in Indochina was an example of communist\nexpansionism directed by the Soviet Union.[111]\n\nMilitary advisors from the People's Republic of China (PRC) began assisting\nthe Viet Minh in July 1950.[112] PRC weapons, expertise, and laborers\ntransformed the Viet Minh from a guerrilla force into a regular army.[113] In\nSeptember 1950, the United States created a [Military Assistance and Advisory\nGroup](/wiki/Military_Assistance_Advisory_Group \"Military Assistance Advisory\nGroup\") (MAAG) to screen French requests for aid, advise on strategy, and\ntrain Vietnamese soldiers.[114] By 1954, the United States had spent US$1\nbillion in support of the French military effort, shouldering 80 percent of\nthe cost of the war.[115]\n\nDuring the [Battle of Dien Bien Phu](/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu \"Battle of\nDien Bien Phu\") U.S. carriers sailed to the [Gulf of\nTonkin](/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin \"Gulf of Tonkin\") and the U.S. conducted\nreconnaissance flights. There were also talks between the French and Americans\nin which the possible use of three [tactical nuclear\nweapons](/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon \"Tactical nuclear weapon\") was\nconsidered, though reports of how seriously this was considered and by whom\nare vague and contradictory.[116][117] According to U.S. Vice-President\n[Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\"), the plan involved the\nJoint Chiefs of Staff drawing up plans to use three small tactical nuclear\nweapons in support of the French.[116] Nixon, a so-called\n\"[hawk](/wiki/War_Hawk \"War Hawk\")\" on Vietnam, suggested that the United\nStates might have to \"put American boys in\".[118] U.S. President [Dwight D.\nEisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\") made American\nparticipation contingent on British support, but the British were\nopposed.[118] Eisenhower decided against U.S. military intervention, being\nwary of getting the United States involved in a land war in Asia.[119]\nThroughout the conflict, U.S. intelligence estimates remained skeptical of\nFrench chances of success.[120]\n\nOn 7 May 1954, the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu surrendered. The defeat\nmarked the end of French military involvement in Indochina. At the [Geneva\nConference](/wiki/Geneva_Conference_\\(1954\\) \"Geneva Conference \\(1954\\)\"),\nthe French negotiated a ceasefire agreement with the Viet Minh, and\nindependence was granted to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.\n\n## Transition period\n\nMain articles: [Geneva Conference (1954)](/wiki/Geneva_Conference_\\(1954\\)\n\"Geneva Conference \\(1954\\)\"); [Operation Passage to\nFreedom](/wiki/Operation_Passage_to_Freedom \"Operation Passage to Freedom\");\n[Battle of Saigon (1955)](/wiki/Battle_of_Saigon_\\(1955\\) \"Battle of Saigon\n\\(1955\\)\"); [Ba Cụt](/wiki/Ba_C%E1%BB%A5t \"Ba Cụt\"); [State of Vietnam\nreferendum, 1955](/wiki/State_of_Vietnam_referendum,_1955 \"State of Vietnam\nreferendum, 1955\"); [Land reform in Vietnam](/wiki/Land_reform_in_Vietnam\n\"Land reform in Vietnam\"); and [Land reform in North\nVietnam](/wiki/Land_reform_in_North_Vietnam \"Land reform in North Vietnam\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Gen-\ncommons.jpg/220px-Gen-commons.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gen-commons.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gen-commons.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Geneva Conference](/wiki/Geneva_Conference_\\(1954\\) \"Geneva Conference\n\\(1954\\)\"), 1954\n\nAt the [1954 Geneva peace conference](/wiki/Geneva_Conference_\\(1954\\) \"Geneva\nConference \\(1954\\)\"), Vietnam was [temporarily\npartitioned](/wiki/Partition_of_Vietnam \"Partition of Vietnam\") at the [17th\nparallel](/wiki/17th_parallel_north \"17th parallel north\"). Ho Chi Minh had\nwished to continue the war in the south, but was restrained by his Chinese\nallies who convinced him that he could win control by electoral\nmeans.[121][122] Under the terms of the Geneva Accords, civilians were to be\ngiven the opportunity to move freely between the two provisional states for a\n300-day period. Elections throughout the country were to be held in 1956 to\nestablish a unified government.[123] Around one million northerners, mainly\nminority Catholics, fled south, fearing persecution by the communists.[124]\nThis followed an American [psychological warfare](/wiki/Psychological_warfare\n\"Psychological warfare\") campaign, designed by [Edward\nLansdale](/wiki/Edward_Lansdale \"Edward Lansdale\") for the CIA, which\nexaggerated anti-Catholic sentiment among the Viet Minh and which falsely\nclaimed the US was about to drop atomic bombs on Hanoi.[125][126][127] The\nexodus was coordinated by a U.S.-funded $93 million relocation program, which\nincluded the use of the [Seventh Fleet](/wiki/Seventh_Fleet \"Seventh Fleet\")\nto ferry refugees.[128] The northern, mainly Catholic refugees gave the later\n[Ngô Đình Diệm](/wiki/Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Di%E1%BB%87m \"Ngô Đình Diệm\")\nregime a strong anti-communist constituency.[129] Diệm staffed his\ngovernment's key posts mostly with northern and central Catholics.\n\nIn addition to the Catholics flowing south, up to 130,000 \"Revolutionary\nRegroupees\" went to the north for \"regroupment\", expecting to return to the\nsouth within two years.[130] The Viet Minh left roughly 5,000 to 10,000\n[cadres](/wiki/Cadre_\\(politics\\) \"Cadre \\(politics\\)\") in the south as a\n\"politico-military substructure within the object of its\n[irredentism](/wiki/Irredentism \"Irredentism\").\"[131] The last French soldiers\nwere to leave Vietnam in April 1956.[113] The PRC completed its withdrawal\nfrom North Vietnam at around the same time.[112] Around 52,000 Vietnamese\ncivilians moved from south to north.[132]\n\nBetween 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various\nagrarian reforms, including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which resulted\nin significant political oppression. During the land reform, testimony from\nNorth Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160\nvillage residents, which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000\nexecutions. Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River\nDelta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by\nscholars at the time.[133][134][135][136] However, declassified documents from\nthe Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions\nwas much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than\n13,500.[137] In 1956, leaders in Hanoi admitted to \"excesses\" in implementing\nthis program and restored a large amount of the land to the original\nowners.[138]\n\nThe south, meanwhile, constituted the State of Vietnam, with Bảo Đại as\nEmperor and [Ngô Đình Diệm](/wiki/Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Di%E1%BB%87m \"Ngô\nĐình Diệm\") (appointed in July 1954) as his prime minister. Neither the United\nStates government nor Ngô Đình Diệm's State of Vietnam signed anything at the\n[1954 Geneva Conference](/wiki/1954_Geneva_Conference \"1954 Geneva\nConference\"). With respect to the question of reunification, the non-communist\nVietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam, but\nlost out when the French accepted the proposal of Viet Minh delegate [Phạm Văn\nĐồng](/wiki/Ph%E1%BA%A1m_V%C4%83n_%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng \"Phạm Văn Đồng\"),[139] who\nproposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision\nof \"local commissions\".[140] The United States countered with what became\nknown as the \"American Plan\", with the support of South Vietnam and the United\nKingdom.[141] It provided for unification elections under the supervision of\nthe United Nations, but was rejected by the Soviet delegation.[141] The United\nStates said, \"With respect to the statement made by the representative of the\nState of Vietnam, the United States reiterates its traditional position that\npeoples are entitled to determine their own future and that it will not join\nin any arrangement which would hinder this\".[142] U.S. President [Dwight D.\nEisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D.

In early 1957\nSouth Vietnam enjoyed its first peace in over a decade. Incidents of political\nviolence began to occur in mid-1957, but the government \"did not construe it\nas a campaign, considering the disorders too diffuse to warrant committing\nmajor GVN [Government of Vietnam] resources.\" By early 1959, however, Diệm had\ncome to regard the (increasingly frequent) disorders as an organized campaign\nand implemented Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death\nand property confiscation.[155] There had been some division among former Viet\nMinh whose main goal was to hold the elections promised in the Geneva Accords,\nleading to \"[wildcat](/wiki/Wildcat_strike \"Wildcat strike\")\" activities\nseparate from the other communists and anti-GVN activists.[25]\n\nIn December 1960, the [National Liberation Front](/wiki/Viet_Cong \"Viet Cong\")\n(NLF, a.k.a. the Viet Cong) was formally created with the intent of uniting\nall anti-GVN activists, including non-communists. It was formed in [Memot,\nCambodia](/wiki/Memot_District \"Memot District\"), and directed through a\ncentral office known as [COSVN](/wiki/Central_Office_for_South_Vietnam\n\"Central Office for South Vietnam\"). According to the _Pentagon Papers_ , the\nViet Cong \"placed heavy emphasis on the withdrawal of American advisors and\ninfluence, on land reform and liberalization of the GVN, on [coalition\ngovernment](/wiki/Coalition_government \"Coalition government\") and the\nneutralization of Vietnam.\" Often the leaders of the organization were kept\nsecret.[25]\n\nSupport for the NLF was driven by peasant resentment of Diem's reversal of\nland reforms in the countryside. The vast majority of the population lived in\nvillages in the countryside, where a key demand was for land reform. In areas\nthey controlled, the [Viet Minh](/wiki/Viet_Minh \"Viet Minh\") had confiscated\nlarge private landholdings, reduced rents and debts, and leased communal\nlands, mostly to the poorer peasants. Diem brought the landlords back to the\nvillages. People who were farming land they had held for years now had to\nreturn it to landlords and pay years of back rent. This rent collection was\nenforced by the South Vietnamese army. The divisions within villages\nreproduced those that had existed against the French: _\" 75 percent support\nfor the NLF, 20 percent trying to remain neutral and 5 percent firmly pro-\ngovernment\"_.[156]\n\n#### North Vietnamese involvement\n\nSee also: [North Vietnamese invasion of\nLaos](/wiki/North_Vietnamese_invasion_of_Laos \"North Vietnamese invasion of\nLaos\") and [Ho Chi Minh trail](/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_trail \"Ho Chi Minh trail\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/HoCMT.png/200px-\nHoCMT.png)](/wiki/File:HoCMT.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HoCMT.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Ho Chi Minh trail](/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_trail \"Ho Chi Minh trail\"), known as\nthe Truong Son Road by the North Vietnamese, cuts through Laos.

In\n1961, the U.S. had 50,000 troops based in South Korea, and Kennedy faced a\nthree-part crisis—the failure of the [Bay of Pigs\nInvasion](/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion \"Bay of Pigs Invasion\"), the construction\nof the [Berlin Wall](/wiki/Berlin_Wall \"Berlin Wall\"), and a negotiated\nsettlement between the pro-Western government of Laos and the [Pathet\nLao](/wiki/Pathet_Lao \"Pathet Lao\") communist movement.[165] These crises made\nKennedy believe that another failure on the part of the United States to gain\ncontrol and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility\nwith its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy was thus determined to \"draw a\nline in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James\nReston of _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York\nTimes\")_ immediately after his Vienna meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a\nproblem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"[166][167]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/South_Vietnam_Map.jpg/220px-\nSouth_Vietnam_Map.jpg)](/wiki/File:South_Vietnam_Map.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:South_Vietnam_Map.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[South Vietnam](/wiki/South_Vietnam \"South Vietnam\"), Military Regions, 1967\n\nKennedy's policy toward South Vietnam rested on the assumption that Diệm and\nhis forces had to ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their own. He was\nagainst the deployment of American combat troops and observed that \"to\nintroduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today, while it might have an\ninitially favorable military impact, would almost certainly lead to adverse\npolitical and, in the long run, adverse military consequences.\"[168] The\nquality of the South Vietnamese military, however, remained poor. Poor\nleadership, corruption, and political promotions all played a part in\nweakening the South Vietnamese Army (formally Army of the Republic of Vietnam\nor ARVN). The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered\nsteam. While Hanoi's support for the Viet Cong played a role, South Vietnamese\ngovernmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis.[169]\n\nOne major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile\nprograms had surpassed those of the United States. Although Kennedy stressed\nlong-range missile parity with the Soviets, he was also interested in using\n[special forces](/wiki/Special_forces \"Special forces\") for\n[counterinsurgency](/wiki/Counterinsurgency \"Counterinsurgency\") warfare in\nThird World countries threatened by communist insurgencies. Although they were\noriginally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional Soviet\ninvasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by\nspecial forces such as the [Green\nBerets](/wiki/Special_Forces_\\(United_States_Army\\) \"Special Forces \\(United\nStates Army\\)\") would be effective in a \"brush fire\" war in Vietnam.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/President_meets_with_Secretary_of_Defense._President_Kennedy%2C_Secretary_McNamara._White_House%2C_Cabinet_Room_-\n_NARA_-_194244.jpg/220px-\nPresident_meets_with_Secretary_of_Defense._President_Kennedy%2C_Secretary_McNamara._White_House%2C_Cabinet_Room_-\n_NARA_-_194244.jpg)](/wiki/File:President_meets_with_Secretary_of_Defense._President_Kennedy,_Secretary_McNamara._White_House,_Cabinet_Room_-\n_NARA_-_194244.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:President_meets_with_Secretary_of_Defense._President_Kennedy,_Secretary_McNamara._White_House,_Cabinet_Room_-\n_NARA_-_194244.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Kennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F.

In April 1962, [John Kenneth Galbraith](/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith\n\"John Kenneth Galbraith\") warned Kennedy of the \"danger we shall replace the\nFrench as a colonial force in the area and bleed as the French did.\"[171] By\nNovember 1963, there were 16,000 American military personnel in South Vietnam,\nup from Eisenhower's 900 advisors.[172]\n\nThe [Strategic Hamlet Program](/wiki/Strategic_Hamlet_Program \"Strategic\nHamlet Program\") was initiated in late 1961. This joint U.S.–South Vietnamese\nprogram attempted to resettle the rural population into fortified camps. It\nwas implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village\ninternment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities\nwhere the peasantry would be isolated from Communist insurgents. It was hoped\nthese new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen\nthe tie between them and the central government. However, by November 1963 the\nprogram had waned, and it officially ended in 1964.[173]\n\nOn 23 July 1962, fourteen nations, including China, South Vietnam, the Soviet\nUnion, North Vietnam and the United States, signed an\n[agreement](/wiki/International_Agreement_on_the_Neutrality_of_Laos\n\"International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos\") promising to respect the\nneutrality of Laos.\n\n### Ousting and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm\n\nMain articles: [Cable 243](/wiki/Cable_243 \"Cable 243\"), [Arrest and\nassassination of Ngô Đình\nDiệm](/wiki/Arrest_and_assassination_of_Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Di%E1%BB%87m\n\"Arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm\"), [Buddhist\ncrisis](/wiki/Buddhist_crisis \"Buddhist crisis\"), [Krulak Mendenhall\nmission](/wiki/Krulak_Mendenhall_mission \"Krulak Mendenhall mission\"),\n[McNamara Taylor mission](/wiki/McNamara_Taylor_mission \"McNamara Taylor\nmission\"), [1963 South Vietnamese coup](/wiki/1963_South_Vietnamese_coup \"1963\nSouth Vietnamese coup\"), and [Reaction to the 1963 South Vietnamese\ncoup](/wiki/Reaction_to_the_1963_South_Vietnamese_coup \"Reaction to the 1963\nSouth Vietnamese coup\")\n\nSee also: [Role of the United States in the Vietnam War § John F.

Cao was\na Catholic who had been promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than\nskill, and his main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coup attempts;\nhe had earlier vomited during a communist attack. Some policymakers in\nWashington began to conclude that Diệm was incapable of defeating the\ncommunists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh. He seemed concerned\nonly with fending off coups, and had become more paranoid after attempts in\n1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to U.S. encouragement. As [Robert F.\nKennedy](/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy \"Robert F. Kennedy\") noted, \"Diệm wouldn't\nmake even the slightest concessions.

This resulted in mass\nprotests against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to the Catholic\nChurch and its adherents over the Buddhist majority. Diệm's elder brother [Ngô\nĐình Thục](/wiki/Pierre_Martin_Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Th%E1%BB%A5c \"Pierre\nMartin Ngô Đình Thục\") was the Archbishop of Huế and aggressively blurred the\nseparation between church and state. Thuc's anniversary celebrations shortly\nbefore Vesak had been bankrolled by the government, and Vatican flags were\ndisplayed prominently. There had also been reports of Buddhist pagodas being\ndemolished by Catholic paramilitaries throughout Diệm's rule. Diệm refused to\nmake concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the\ndeaths. On 21 August 1963, the [ARVN Special\nForces](/wiki/Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam_Special_Forces \"Army of the\nRepublic of Vietnam Special Forces\") of Colonel [Lê Quang\nTung](/wiki/L%C3%AA_Quang_Tung \"Lê Quang Tung\"), loyal to Diệm's younger\nbrother [Ngô Đình Nhu](/wiki/Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Nhu \"Ngô Đình Nhu\"),\n[raided pagodas](/wiki/X%C3%A1_L%E1%BB%A3i_Pagoda_raids \"Xá Lợi Pagoda raids\")\nacross Vietnam, causing widespread damage and destruction and leaving a death\ntoll estimated to range into the hundreds.\n\nU.S. officials began discussing the possibility of a [regime\nchange](/wiki/Regime_change \"Regime change\") during the middle of 1963. The\n[United States Department of State](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State\n\"United States Department of State\") was generally in favor of encouraging a\ncoup, while the Defense Department favored Diệm. Chief among the proposed\nchanges was the removal of Diệm's younger brother Nhu, who controlled the\nsecret police and special forces, and was seen as the man behind the Buddhist\nrepression and more generally the architect of the Ngô family's rule. This\nproposal was conveyed to the U.S. embassy in Saigon in [Cable\n243](/wiki/Cable_243 \"Cable 243\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Corpse_of_Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Di%E1%BB%87m_in_the_1963_coup.jpg/220px-\nCorpse_of_Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Di%E1%BB%87m_in_the_1963_coup.jpg)](/wiki/File:Corpse_of_Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Di%E1%BB%87m_in_the_1963_coup.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Corpse_of_Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Di%E1%BB%87m_in_the_1963_coup.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Ngô Đình Diệm](/wiki/Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Di%E1%BB%87m \"Ngô Đình Diệm\")\nafter being shot and killed in a coup on 2 November 1963\n\nThe [Central Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency \"Central\nIntelligence Agency\") (CIA) was in contact with generals planning to remove\nDiệm. They were told that the United States would not oppose such a move nor\npunish the generals by cutting off aid. President Diệm was overthrown and\nexecuted, along with his brother, on 2 November 1963. When Kennedy was\ninformed, Maxwell Taylor remembered that he \"rushed from the room with a look\nof shock and dismay on his face.\"[177] Kennedy had not anticipated Diệm's\nmurder. The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, [Henry Cabot\nLodge](/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr. \"Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.\"), invited the coup\nleaders to the embassy and congratulated them. Ambassador Lodge informed\nKennedy that \"the prospects now are for a shorter war\".[178] Kennedy wrote\nLodge a letter congratulating him for \"a fine job\".[179]\n\nFollowing the coup, chaos ensued. Hanoi took advantage of the situation and\nincreased its support for the guerrillas. South Vietnam entered a period of\nextreme political instability, as one military government toppled another in\nquick succession. Increasingly, each new regime was viewed by the communists\nas a puppet of the Americans; whatever the failings of Diệm, his credentials\nas a nationalist (as Robert McNamara later reflected) had been\nimpeccable.[180]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Viet_Cong002.jpg/220px-\nViet_Cong002.jpg)](/wiki/File:Viet_Cong002.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Viet_Cong002.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nViet Cong fighters crossing a river\n\nU.S. military advisors were embedded at every level of the South Vietnamese\narmed forces. They were however criticized for ignoring the political nature\nof the insurgency.[181] The Kennedy administration sought to refocus U.S.\nefforts on pacification and [\"winning over the hearts and\nminds\"](/wiki/Winning_hearts_and_minds \"Winning hearts and minds\") of the\npopulation. The military leadership in Washington, however, was hostile to any\nrole for U.S. advisors other than conventional troop training.[182] General\n[Paul Harkins](/wiki/Paul_D._Harkins \"Paul D.

This was despite there being over 25,000 South\nVietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period.[307]\n\nThe success of the 1973–74 dry season offensive inspired Trà to return to\nHanoi in October 1974 and plead for a larger offensive the next dry season.\nThis time, Trà could travel on a drivable highway with regular fueling stops,\na vast change from the days when the Ho Chi Minh trail was a dangerous\nmountain trek.[308] Giáp, the North Vietnamese defence minister, was reluctant\nto approve of Trà's plan since a larger offensive might provoke U.S. reaction\nand interfere with the big push planned for 1976. Trà appealed over Giáp's\nhead to first secretary [Lê Duẩn](/wiki/L%C3%AA_Du%E1%BA%A9n \"Lê Duẩn\"), who\napproved of the operation. Trà's plan called for a limited offensive from\nCambodia into [Phước Long Province](/wiki/Ph%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc_Long_Province\n\"Phước Long Province\"). The strike was designed to solve local logistical\nproblems, gauge the reaction of South Vietnamese forces, and determine whether\nU.S. would return.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/Victory_Central_Highlands.JPG/170px-\nVictory_Central_Highlands.JPG)](/wiki/File:Victory_Central_Highlands.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Victory_Central_Highlands.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nMemorial commemorating the 1974 Buon Me Thuot campaign, depicting a\n[Montagnard](/wiki/Degar \"Degar\") of the [Central\nHighlands](/wiki/Central_Highlands,_Vietnam \"Central Highlands, Vietnam\"), a\nPAVN soldier and a [T-54 tank](/wiki/T-54/T-55 \"T-54/T-55\")\n\nAt the start of 1975, the South Vietnamese had three times as much artillery\nand twice the number of tanks and armoured cars as the opposition. They also\nhad 1,400 aircraft and a two-to-one numerical superiority in combat troops\nover their Communist enemies.[309] However, the rising oil prices meant that\nmuch of this could not be used, and the rushed nature of Vietnamization,\nintended to cover the US retreat, saw a lack of spare parts, ground-crew and\nmaintenance personnel, rendering most of the equipment given inoperable.[310]\n[Gerald Ford](/wiki/Gerald_Ford \"Gerald Ford\") took over as U.S. president on\n9 August 1974 after President Nixon resigned due to the [Watergate\nscandal](/wiki/Watergate_scandal \"Watergate scandal\") and Congress cut\nfinancial aid to South Vietnam from $1 billion a year to $700 million.\nCongress also voted in further restrictions on funding to be phased in through\n1975 and to culminate in a total cutoff in 1976.\n\nOn 13 December 1974, North Vietnamese forces [attacked Route 14 in Phước Long\nProvince](/wiki/Battle_of_Phuoc_Long \"Battle of Phuoc Long\"). Phuoc Binh, the\nprovincial capital, fell on 6 January 1975. Ford desperately asked Congress\nfor funds to assist and re-supply the South before it was overrun.[311]\nCongress refused.[311] The fall of Phuoc Binh and the lack of an American\nresponse left the South Vietnamese elite demoralized.\n\nThe speed of this success led the Politburo to reassess its strategy. It was\ndecided that operations in the Central Highlands would be turned over to\nGeneral [Văn Tiến Dũng](/wiki/V%C4%83n_Ti%E1%BA%BFn_D%C5%A9ng \"Văn Tiến Dũng\")\nand that Pleiku should be seized, if possible.

If the town could be taken, the provincial capital of\n[Pleiku](/wiki/Pleiku \"Pleiku\") and the road to the coast would be exposed for\na planned campaign in 1976. The ARVN proved incapable of resisting the\nonslaught, and its forces collapsed on 11 March. Once again, Hanoi was\nsurprised by the speed of their success. Dung now urged the Politburo to allow\nhim to seize Pleiku immediately and then turn his attention to [Kon\nTum](/wiki/Kon_Tum \"Kon Tum\"). He argued that with two months of good weather\nremaining until the onset of the monsoon, it would be irresponsible to not\ntake advantage of the situation.[56]\n\nPresident [Nguyễn Văn Thiệu](/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_V%C4%83n_Thi%E1%BB%87u\n\"Nguyễn Văn Thiệu\"), a former general, was fearful that his forces would be\ncut off in the north by the attacking communists; Thieu ordered a retreat,\nwhich soon turned into a bloody rout. While the bulk of ARVN forces attempted\nto flee, isolated units fought desperately. ARVN General Phu abandoned Pleiku\nand Kon Tum and retreated toward the coast, in what became known as the\n\"column of tears\".[56]\n\nOn 20 March, Thieu reversed himself and ordered Huế, Vietnam's third-largest\ncity, be held at all costs, and then changed his policy several times. As the\nNorth Vietnamese launched their attack, panic set in, and ARVN resistance\nwithered. On 22 March, the NVA opened the siege of Huế. Civilians flooded the\nairport and the docks hoping for any mode of escape.[56] As resistance in Huế\ncollapsed, North Vietnamese rockets rained down on [Da Nang](/wiki/Hue-\nDa_Nang_Campaign \"Hue-Da Nang Campaign\") and its airport. By 28 March 35,000\nVPA troops were poised to attack the suburbs. By 30 March 100,000 leaderless\nARVN troops surrendered as the NVA marched victoriously through Da Nang.

The\noperational plan for the [Ho Chi Minh Campaign](/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_Campaign \"Ho\nChi Minh Campaign\") called for the capture of Saigon before 1 May. Hanoi\nwished to avoid the coming monsoon and prevent any redeployment of ARVN forces\ndefending the capital. Northern forces, their morale boosted by their recent\nvictories, rolled on, taking Nha Trang, Cam Ranh, and Da Lat.\n\nOn 7 April, three North Vietnamese divisions attacked [Xuân\nLộc](/wiki/Battle_of_Xu%C3%A2n_L%E1%BB%99c \"Battle of Xuân Lộc\"), 40 miles (64\nkm) east of Saigon. For two bloody weeks, severe fighting raged as the ARVN\ndefenders made a [last stand](/wiki/Last_stand \"Last stand\") to try to block\nthe North Vietnamese advance. By 21 April, however, the exhausted garrison\nwere ordered to withdraw towards Saigon. An embittered and tearful president\nThieu resigned on the same day, declaring that the United States betrayed\nSouth Vietnam. In a scathing attack, he suggested U.S. Secretary of State\nHenry Kissinger had tricked him into signing the Paris peace agreement two\nyears earlier, promising military aid that failed to materialize. Having\ntransferred power to [Trần Văn\nHương](/wiki/Tr%E1%BA%A7n_V%C4%83n_H%C6%B0%C6%A1ng \"Trần Văn Hương\"), he left\nfor [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\") on 25 April.\n\nBy the end of April, the ARVN collapsed on all fronts except in the [Mekong\nDelta](/wiki/Mekong_Delta \"Mekong Delta\"). Thousands of refugees streamed\nsouthward, ahead of the main communist onslaught. On 27 April 100,000 North\nVietnamese troops encircled Saigon. The city was defended by about 30,000 ARVN\ntroops. To hasten a collapse and foment panic, the NVA shelled the airport and\nforced its closure.

American support of Diệm in refusing elections was seen\nas thwarting the democracy America claimed to support. John F.

Some advocates within the peace movement advocated a\n[unilateral](/wiki/Unilateral \"Unilateral\") withdrawal of U.S. forces from\nVietnam.

Points he makes on\nthe latter topic include: the higher proportion of combat casualties in\nVietnam among African American servicemen than among American soldiers of\nother races, the shift toward and different attitudes of black military\ncareerists versus black draftees, the discrimination encountered by black\nservicemen \"on the battlefield in decorations, promotion and duty assignments\"\nas well as their having to endure \"the racial insults, cross-burnings and\nConfederate flags of their white comrades\"—and the experiences faced by black\nsoldiers stateside, during the war and after America's withdrawal.[422] Civil\nrights leaders protested the disproportionate casualties and the over-\nrepresentation in hazardous duty and combat roles experienced by African\nAmerican servicemen, prompting reforms that were implemented beginning in\n1967–68. As a result, by the war's completion in 1975, black casualties had\ndeclined to 12.5% of US combat deaths, approximately equal to percentage of\ndraft-eligible black men, though still slightly higher than the 10% who served\nin the military.[423]\n\n## Weapons\n\nMain article: [Weapons of the Vietnam War](/wiki/Weapons_of_the_Vietnam_War\n\"Weapons of the Vietnam War\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/HoChiMinhTrail003.jpg/170px-\nHoChiMinhTrail003.jpg)](/wiki/File:HoChiMinhTrail003.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HoChiMinhTrail003.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGuerillas assemble shells and rockets delivered along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\n\nDuring the early stages the Viet Cong mainly sustained itself with captured\narms, often of American manufacture[424] or crude, self-made weapons [425] and\n[shotguns](/wiki/Shotgun \"Shotgun\") made of galvanized pipes.[426] Most arms\nwere captured from poorly defended ARVN militia outposts.[427] In 1967, all\nViet Cong battalions were reequipped with arms of Soviet design such as the\n[AK-47](/wiki/AK-47 \"AK-47\") assault rifle and the [RPG-2](/wiki/RPG-2\n\"RPG-2\") anti-tank weapon.[428] Their weapons were principally of Chinese[429]\nor Soviet manufacture.[430] The period up to the conventional phase in the\n1970, the Viet Cong and NVA were primarily limited to mortars 81-mm mortars,\nrecoil-less rifles and small-arms and had significantly lighter equipment and\nfirepower in comparison with the US arsenal, relying on ambushes alongside\nsuperior stealth, planning, marksmanship and small-unit tactics to face the\ndisproportionate US technological advantage.[431]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/M41-walker-bulldog-\ntank.jpg/220px-M41-walker-bulldog-tank.jpg)](/wiki/File:M41-walker-bulldog-\ntank.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:M41-walker-bulldog-tank.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[M41 Walker Bulldog](/wiki/M41_Walker_Bulldog \"M41 Walker Bulldog\"), the\nprimary tank of the US and ARVN\n\nAfter the Tet Offensive, many North Vietnamese units incorporated [light\ntanks](/wiki/Light_tank \"Light tank\") such as the [Type 62](/wiki/Type_62\n\"Type 62\") [Type 59 tank](/wiki/Type_59_tank \"Type 59 tank\").,\n[BTR-60](/wiki/BTR-60 \"BTR-60\"), [Type 60\nartillery](/wiki/D-74_122_mm_field_gun \"D-74 122 mm field gun\"), [amphibious\ntanks](/wiki/Amphibious_vehicle \"Amphibious vehicle\") (such as the\n[PT-76](/wiki/PT-76 \"PT-76\")) and integrated into new war doctrines as a\nmobile combined-arms force.[432] The North Vietnamese started receiving\nexperimental Soviet weapons against ARVN forces including [MANPADS](/wiki/Man-\nportable_air-defense_system \"Man-portable air-defense system\") [9K32\nStrela-2](/wiki/9K32_Strela-2 \"9K32 Strela-2\"), and [anti-tank\nmissiles](/wiki/Anti-tank_missile \"Anti-tank missile\"), [9M14\nMalyutka](/wiki/9M14_Malyutka \"9M14 Malyutka\").[93] By 1975 they had fully\ntransformed from the strategy of mobile light-infantry and using the people's\nwar concept used against the United States.[432]\n\nThe US service rifle was initially the [M14](/wiki/M14_rifle \"M14 rifle\")\nuntil it was replaced by the [M16 rifle](/wiki/M16_rifle \"M16 rifle\").

Taylor\"), one of the principal architects of the war, noted,\n\"First, we didn't know ourselves. We thought that we were going into another\n[Korean War](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\"), but this was a different country.\nSecondly, we didn't know our South Vietnamese allies… And we knew less about\nNorth Vietnam. Who was [Ho Chi Minh](/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh \"Ho Chi Minh\")? Nobody\nreally knew.

According to a\n2004 Gallup poll, 62 percent of Americans believed it was an unjust war.[469]\nUS public polling in 1978 reveal nearly 72% of Americans believing the war was\n\"fundamentally wrong and immoral\", nearly a decade later the number reduced to\n66% and by 1985 to 2000 surveys consistently show 34–35% believing the war was\nfundamentally wrong and immoral.[470] Nearly a third of Americans believed the\nwar was a noble cause when surveyed in 2000.[470]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Marine_da_nang.jpg/170px-\nMarine_da_nang.jpg)](/wiki/File:Marine_da_nang.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Marine_da_nang.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA young [Marine](/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps \"United States Marine\nCorps\") private waits on the beach during the Marine landing, [Da\nNang](/wiki/Da_Nang \"Da Nang\"), 3 August 1965\n\nFailure of the war is often placed at different institutions and levels. Some\nhave suggested that the failure of the war was due to political failures of\nU.S. leadership.[471] The official history of the [United States\nArmy](/wiki/United_States_Army \"United States Army\") noted that\n\"[tactics](/wiki/Military_tactics \"Military tactics\") have often seemed to\nexist apart from larger issues, strategies, and objectives. Yet in Vietnam the\nArmy experienced tactical success and strategic failure... success rests not\nonly on military progress but on correctly analysing the nature of the\nparticular conflict, understanding the enemy's strategy, and assessing the\nstrengths and weaknesses of allies. A new humility and a new sophistication\nmay form the best parts of a complex heritage left to the Army by the long,\nbitter war in Vietnam.\"[181]\n\nOthers point to a failure of U.S. military doctrine. Secretary of Defense\nRobert McNamara stated that \"the achievement of a military victory by U.S.\nforces in Vietnam was indeed a dangerous illusion.\"[472] The inability to\nbring Hanoi to the bargaining table by bombing also illustrated another U.S.\nmiscalculation, and demonstrated the limitations of U.S. military abilities in\nachieving political goals.[473] As [Army Chief of\nStaff](/wiki/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Army \"Chief of Staff of the\nUnited States Army\") [Harold Keith Johnson](/wiki/Harold_Keith_Johnson \"Harold\nKeith Johnson\") noted, \"if anything came out of Vietnam, it was that air power\ncouldn't do the job.\"[474] Even General William Westmoreland admitted that the\nbombing had been ineffective. As he remarked, \"I still doubt that the North\nVietnamese would have relented.\"[474] U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\nwrote in a secret memo to President Gerald Ford that \"in terms of military\ntactics, we cannot help draw the conclusion that our armed forces are not\nsuited to this kind of war. Even the Special Forces who had been designed for\nit could not prevail.\"[475]\n\nHanoi had persistently sought unification of the country since the Geneva\nAccords, and the effects of U.S. bombings had negligible diplomatic impacts on\nthe goals of the North Vietnamese government.[476] The effects of U.S. bombing\ncampaigns had mobilised the people throughout North Vietnam and mobilised\ninternational support for North Vietnam due to the perception of a super-power\nattempting to bomb a significantly smaller, agrarian society into\nsubmission.[477]\n\nThe [Vietnam War POW/MIA issue](/wiki/Vietnam_War_POW/MIA_issue \"Vietnam War\nPOW/MIA issue\"), concerning the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as\n[missing in action](/wiki/Missing_in_action \"Missing in action\"), persisted\nfor many years after the war's conclusion. The costs of the war loom large in\nAmerican popular consciousness; a 1990 poll showed that the public incorrectly\nbelieved that more Americans lost their lives in Vietnam than in [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\").[478]\n\n#### Cost of the war\n\nBetween 1953 and 1975, the United States was estimated to have spent $168\nbillion on the war ($1.02 trillion in FY2015 dollars).[479] This resulted in a\nlarge federal [budget deficit](/wiki/United_States_public_debt \"United States\npublic debt\"). Other figures point to $138.9 billion from 1965 to 1974 (not\ninflation-adjusted), ten times the amount of support for all education\nspending in the US and 50 times more than housing and community development\nspending within that time period.[480] General record-keeping was reported to\nhave been sloppy for government spending during the war.[480] It was stated\nthat war-spending could have paid off every mortgage in the US at that time,\nwith money leftover.[480]\n\nMore than 3 million Americans served in the Vietnam War, some 1.5 million of\nwhom actually saw combat in Vietnam.[481] James E.

Furthermore, throughout\nthe war there was found to be considerable flaws and dishonesty by officers\nand commanders due to promotions being tied to the [body count\nsystem](/wiki/Body_count#Vietnam_War \"Body count\") touted by Westmoreland and\nMcNamara.[493]\n\nRon Milam has questioned the severity of the \"breakdown\" of the U.S. armed\nforces, especially among combat troops, as reflecting the opinions of \"angry\ncolonels\" who deplored the erosion of traditional military values during the\nVietnam War.[494] Although acknowledging serious problems, he questions the\nalleged \"near mutinous\" conduct of junior officers and enlisted men in combat.\nInvestigating one combat refusal incident, a journalist declared, \"A certain\nsense of independence, a reluctance to behave according to the military's\ninsistence on obedience, like pawns or puppets...The grunts [infantrymen] were\ndetermined to survive...they insisted of having something to say about the\nmaking of decisions that determined whether they might live or die.\"[495] The\nmorale and discipline problems and resistance to\n[conscription](/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States \"Conscription in the\nUnited States\") (the draft) were important factors leading to the creation of\nan all-volunteer military force by the United States and the termination of\nconscription.

These chemicals continue to\nchange the landscape, cause diseases and birth defects, and poison the food\nchain.[499][500]\n\nEarly in the American military effort, it was decided that since the enemy\nwere hiding their activities under triple-canopy jungle, a useful first step\nmight be to defoliate certain areas.

About 11–12 million\ngallons (41.6–45.4 million L) of Agent Orange were sprayed over southern\nVietnam between 1961 and 1971.[503] A prime area of Ranch Hand operations was\nin the [Mekong Delta](/wiki/Mekong_Delta \"Mekong Delta\"), where the U.S. Navy\npatrol boats were vulnerable to attack from the undergrowth at the water's\nedge.\n\nIn 1961 and 1962, the Kennedy administration authorized the use of chemicals\nto destroy rice crops. Between 1961 and 1967, the U.S. Air Force sprayed 20\nmillion U.S. gallons (75,700,000 L) of concentrated herbicides over 6 million\nacres (24,000 km2) of crops and trees, affecting an estimated 13% of South\nVietnam's land. In 1965, 42% of all herbicide was sprayed over food crops.\nAnother purpose of herbicide use was to drive civilian populations into RVN-\ncontrolled areas.[504]\n\nVietnamese victims affected by Agent Orange attempted a class action lawsuit\nagainst Dow Chemical and other U.S. chemical manufacturers, but [District\nCourt](/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_New_York\n\"United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York\") Judge\n[Jack B.

In some areas of southern\nVietnam, dioxin levels remain at over 100 times the accepted international\nstandard.[507]\n\nIn 2006, Anh Duc Ngo and colleagues of the [University of Texas Health Science\nCenter](/wiki/University_of_Texas_Health_Science_Center \"University of Texas\nHealth Science Center\") published a [meta-analysis](/wiki/Meta-analysis \"Meta-\nanalysis\") that exposed a large amount of heterogeneity (different findings)\nbetween studies, a finding consistent with a lack of consensus on the issue on\nthe effect of Agent Orange in Vietnam.[508] Despite this, statistical analysis\nof the studies they examined resulted in data that the increase in birth\ndefects/[relative risk](/wiki/Relative_risk \"Relative risk\") (RR) from\nexposure to agent orange/dioxin \"appears\" to be on the order of 3 in\nVietnamese-funded studies, but 1.29 in the rest of the world.

Another notable work was the diary of [Đặng Thùy\nTrâm](/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BA%B7ng_Th%C3%B9y_Tr%C3%A2m \"Đặng Thùy Trâm\"), a\nVietnamese doctor who enlisted in the Southern battlefield, and was killed at\nthe age of 27 by US forces near [Quảng Ngãi](/wiki/Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_Ng%C3%A3i\n\"Quảng Ngãi\").

In Vietnam the diary has often been compared to _[The Diary of\nAnne Frank](/wiki/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl \"The Diary of a Young Girl\")_ and\nboth are used in literary education.[536] Another Vietnamese film produced was\n_[The Abandoned Field: Free Fire\nZone](/wiki/The_Abandoned_Field:_Free_Fire_Zone \"The Abandoned Field: Free\nFire Zone\")_ (_Cánh đồng hoang)_ in 1979 which weaves the narrative of living\non the ground in a US \"free-fire zone\" as well as perspectives from US\nhelicopters.\n\nIn American popular culture, the \"Crazy Vietnam Veteran\", who was suffering\nfrom [posttraumatic stress disorder](/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder\n\"Posttraumatic stress disorder\"), became a common [stock\ncharacter](/wiki/Stock_character \"Stock character\") after the war.\n\nOne of the first major films based on the Vietnam War was [John\nWayne](/wiki/John_Wayne \"John Wayne\")'s pro-war film, _[The Green\nBerets](/wiki/The_Green_Berets_\\(film\\) \"The Green Berets \\(film\\)\")_ (1968).\nFurther cinematic representations were released during the 1970s and 1980s,\nincluding [Michael Cimino](/wiki/Michael_Cimino \"Michael Cimino\")'s _[The Deer\nHunter](/wiki/The_Deer_Hunter \"The Deer Hunter\")_ (1978), [Francis Ford\nCoppola](/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola \"Francis Ford Coppola\")'s _[Apocalypse\nNow](/wiki/Apocalypse_Now \"Apocalypse Now\")_ (1979), [Oliver\nStone](/wiki/Oliver_Stone \"Oliver Stone\")'s _[Platoon](/wiki/Platoon_\\(film\\)\n\"Platoon \\(film\\)\")_ (1986) – based on his service in the [U.S.\nmilitary](/wiki/U.S._military \"U.S. military\") during the Vietnam War,\n[Stanley Kubrick](/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick \"Stanley Kubrick\")'s _[Full Metal\nJacket](/wiki/Full_Metal_Jacket \"Full Metal Jacket\")_ (1987), _[Hamburger\nHill](/wiki/Hamburger_Hill \"Hamburger Hill\")_ (1987), _[Born on the Fourth of\nJuly](/wiki/Born_on_the_Fourth_of_July_\\(film\\) \"Born on the Fourth of July\n\\(film\\)\")_ (1989), and _[Casualties of War](/wiki/Casualties_of_War\n\"Casualties of War\")_ (1989).

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954–1956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954–1955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper \"Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953–1956\" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper Moise (7–9) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however).\" cf.

A study by Jacqueline Desbarats and Karl D. Jackson estimated that 65,000 South Vietnamese were executed for political reasons between 1975 and 1983, based on a survey of 615 Vietnamese refugees who claimed to have personally witnessed 47 executions. However, \"their methodology was reviewed and criticized as invalid by authors [Gareth Porter](/wiki/Gareth_Porter \"Gareth Porter\") and James Roberts.\" 16 of the 47 names used to extrapolate this \"bloodbath\" were duplicates; this extremely high duplication rate (34%) strongly suggests Desbarats and Jackson were drawing from a small number of total executions. Rather than arguing that this duplication rate proves there were very few executions in post-war Vietnam, Porter and Roberts suggest it is an artifact of the self-selected nature of the participants in the Desbarats-Jackson study, as the authors followed subjects's recommendations on other refugees to interview.
