He is frequently ridiculed by\neveryone around him, except for his [Jack Russell\nTerrier](/wiki/Jack_Russell_Terrier \"Jack Russell Terrier\") Milo, and his co-\nworker and best friend Charlie Schumaker. Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell,\nowner of the Coco Bongo nightclub, plots to overthrow his boss Niko. One day,\nTyrell sends his singer girlfriend Tina Carlyle into Stanley's bank to record\nits layout, in preparation to rob the bank.\n\nStanley is attracted to Tina, and she seems to reciprocate. Unable to enter\nthe Coco Bongo to watch Tina perform, Stanley finds a wooden mask near the\ncity's harbor. Placing it on his face transforms him into a green-faced,\n[zoot-suited](/wiki/Zoot_suit \"Zoot suit\"), bizarre, wisecracking trickster\nknown as the Mask, who is able to cartoonishly alter himself and his\nsurroundings at will. Stanley exacts revenge on his tormentors and scares off\na street gang that attempts to rob him by [turning a\nballoon](/wiki/Balloon_modelling \"Balloon modelling\") into a [Tommy\ngun](/wiki/Tommy_gun \"Tommy gun\").\n\nThe next morning, Stanley encounters detective Lieutenant Kellaway and\nnewspaper reporter Peggy Brandt investigating the Mask's activity of the\nprevious night. To attend Tina's performance, he again becomes the Mask to\nraid the bank, inadvertently foiling Tyrell's plan in the process. At the Coco\nBongo, Stanley dances exuberantly with Tina, whom he ends up kissing.\nFollowing a confrontation with Tyrell for disrupting the bank robbery, Stanley\nflees leaving behind a scrap of cloth from his suit that transforms back into\nhis pajamas, while Tyrell and his men are arrested by Kellaway and his partner\nDoyle.\n\nBased on the piece of cloth, Kellaway suspects Stanley to be the bank robber.\nStanley later consults a psychiatrist who has recently published a book on\nmasks and is discovered that the object may be a depiction of\n[Loki](/wiki/Loki \"Loki\"), the [Norse](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse\nmythology\") god of darkness and mischief. The same night, Stanley meets Tina\nat a local park as the Mask, but the meeting is interrupted by Kellaway, who\nattempts to capture him. Stanley tricks a large group of police officers into\njoining him in a mass-performance of the [Desi Arnaz](/wiki/Desi_Arnaz \"Desi\nArnaz\") song \"Cuban Pete\" and flees with Peggy, but she betrays him to Tyrell\nfor a $50,000 bounty. Using the mask, Tyrell becomes a malevolent green-faced\nmonster. Tyrell's henchmen ends up in the possession of the stolen money after\nStanley is forced to reveal its location; and they turn Stanley in to the\npolice.\n\nWhen Tina visits Stanley in the station, he urges her to flee the city. Tina\nthanks Stanley for his generosity and tells him that she knew he was the Mask\nall along. She attempts to leave the city, but is captured by Tyrell's men and\nforcibly taken to a charity ball at the Coco Bongo hosted by Niko and attended\nby the city's elite, including Mayor Tilton. Upon arrival, the masked Tyrell\nkills Niko and prepares to destroy both the club and Tina with dynamite. Milo\nhelps Stanley escape from the station, and Stanley brings Kellaway as a cover\nand hostage in a desperate attempt to stop Tyrell.\n\nAfter locking Kellaway in his car, Stanley enters the club and manages to\nenlist the help of Charlie, but is soon after discovered and captured. Tina\ntricks Tyrell into taking off the mask, which is recovered and donned by Milo,\nwho fights Tyrell's men, while Stanley fights Tyrell, himself. After\nrecovering the mask, Stanley uses its special powers to rescue Tina by\nswallowing Tyrell's bomb and flushing Tyrell down the drain of the club's\nornamental fountain. The police arrive and arrest Tyrell's remaining henchmen\nand attempt to capture Stanley once again. However, Tilton tells Kellaway to\nrelease Stanley because Tyrell was the Mask the whole time and Tilton calls\nStanley a hero for his actions.\n\nAs the sun rises the following day, all charges against Stanley are dropped.\nTo avoid getting involved with the police again, Stanley decides to return the\nmask back to the harbor. Tina throws the mask into the water, and she and\nStanley kiss. Charlie then jumps in the water to retrieve the mask for\nhimself, only to find Milo swimming away with it.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mask_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Jim Carrey](/wiki/Jim_Carrey \"Jim Carrey\") as [Stanley Ipkiss / The Mask](/wiki/The_Mask \"The Mask\").

The main character\nwent through several transformations, and the project was stalled a couple of\ntimes.[3]\n\nOne unused \"Mask\" idea, according to Mike Richardson, was to transform the\nstory into one about a mask-maker who took faces off of corpses to put them on\nteens and turn them into zombies.[4]\n\nInitially intended to become a new horror franchise, New Line Cinema offered\nthe job of directing the film to Chuck Russell.[5] However, Russell found the\nviolence of the comic to be off-putting, and wanted the film be less grim and\nmore fun than the source material.[6]\n\nMike Werb says Chuck Russell tapped him after reading his script for _[Curious\nGeorge](/wiki/Curious_George_\\(film\\) \"Curious George \\(film\\)\")_ for\n[Imagine](/wiki/Imagine_Entertainment \"Imagine Entertainment\"). The two\ndecided to turn _The Mask_ into a wild romantic comedy.[7] Mike Werb wrote his\nfirst draft of _The Mask_ in less than six weeks, and less than two months\nlater it was green-lit.[8]\n\nAccording to Mike Verheiden, they had a first draft screenplay for a film\nversion done back in 1990. Verheiden then wrote the second draft in early\n1991, adding more humor, and that ended up being the only work he did on _The\nMask_. After that the film went into [development hell](/wiki/Development_hell\n\"Development hell\").[9]\n\nThere were a lot of VFX scenes that had to be cut for budget.[10]\n\n### Visual\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mask_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Visual effects\")]\n\n_The Mask_ 's visual effects were handled by [Industrial Light &\nMagic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic \"Industrial Light & Magic\") (ILM) and\n[Digital Domain](/wiki/Digital_Domain \"Digital Domain\").

Its audio is a 5.1 [Dolby\nTrueHD](/wiki/Dolby_TrueHD \"Dolby TrueHD\") encoded at a 16 bit / 48 kHz sample\nrate. Special features include additional scenes, production details and two\n[commentary tracks](/wiki/Commentary_track \"Commentary track\"), one by\ndirector Chuck Russell and the other by the rest of the production crew.\n\n##\nAdaptations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mask_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Adaptations\")]\n\nAn animated television series was made, _[The Mask: Animated\nSeries](/wiki/The_Mask:_Animated_Series \"The Mask: Animated Series\")_ , and a\nvideo game for the Super Nintendo, _[The Mask](/wiki/The_Mask_\\(video_game\\)\n\"The Mask \\(video game\\)\")_ , were both based on the film.\n\n## Sequel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mask_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Sequel\")]\n\nAfter the success of the original, a sequel was planned, with magazine\n[Nintendo Power](/wiki/Nintendo_Power \"Nintendo Power\") offering readers a\nchance, via [sweepstakes](/wiki/Sweepstakes \"Sweepstakes\"), to win a cameo\nrole in the film.[17] However Jim Carrey eventually bailed on the project\nforcing, amongst other things, for Nintendo Power to give the winner of the\ncontest the equivalent cash value instead.[17] A critically panned sequel,\n_[Son of the Mask](/wiki/Son_of_the_Mask \"Son of the Mask\")_ , not featuring\nCarrey, was eventually released in 2005.\n\n## Possible third\nfilm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mask_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: Possible third film\")]\n\nOn the possibility of a third film, Mike Richardson has said, \"We've been\ntalking about reviving _The Mask_ , both in film and in comics. We've had a\ncouple of false starts.\"[18]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mask_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"The Mask\"](http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/mask-1970-8).
