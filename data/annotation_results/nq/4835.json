History\")]\n\n###\nComposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lady_Jane_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\nThe song was written at a milestone in [The Rolling\nStones](/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones \"The Rolling Stones\") recording career that\nsaw the [musical collaboration](/wiki/Jagger/Richards \"Jagger/Richards\") of\n[Mick Jagger](/wiki/Mick_Jagger \"Mick Jagger\"),and [Keith\nRichards](/wiki/Keith_Richards \"Keith Richards\") emerge as the group's chief\nsongwriters. On the band's previous album, _[Out of Our\nHeads](/wiki/Out_of_Our_Heads \"Out of Our Heads\")_ , the duo shared writing\ncredits on just three tracks. On\n_[Aftermath](/wiki/Aftermath_\\(The_Rolling_Stones_album\\) \"Aftermath \\(The\nRolling Stones album\\)\")_ , however, the two were credited together on every\ntrack, making it the first album to be composed solely of original band\nmaterial.[7] It was also during this period [Brian Jones](/wiki/Brian_Jones\n\"Brian Jones\"), despite losing control of the band's output, was integrating\ndifferent instruments into the group's repertoire. Joe S. Harrington has noted\nthat [The Beatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\")'\n[harpsichord](/wiki/Harpsichord \"Harpsichord\") arrangement featured on the\nsong \"[In My Life](/wiki/In_My_Life \"In My Life\")\", in 1965, opened\nconsiderations for Jones to include baroque rock instrumentals.[5]\n\n\"Lady Jane\" was written and composed by Jagger in early 1966 after reading the\nthen controversial book _[Lady Chatterley's\nLover](/wiki/Lady_Chatterley%27s_Lover \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\")_, which uses\nthe term \"Lady Jane\" to mean [female genitalia](/wiki/Female_genitalia \"Female\ngenitalia\").[8] According to Jagger, \"the names [in the song] are historical,\nbut it was really unconscious that they should fit together from the same\nperiod.\"[9] At the time, it was widely thought that an inspiration for the\nsong was [Jane Ormsby-Gore](/w/index.php?title=Jane_Ormsby-\nGore&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Jane Ormsby-Gore \\(page does not exist\\)\"),\ndaughter of [David Ormsby-Gore](/wiki/David_Ormsby-Gore \"David Ormsby-Gore\"),\nformer British ambassador in Washington, who later married [Michael\nRainey](/wiki/Michael_Rainey \"Michael Rainey\"), founder of the Hung on You\nboutique in [Chelsea](/wiki/Chelsea,_London \"Chelsea, London\") that was\nfrequented by the Stones.[10] Its most impactful development was by Jones, no\nlonger the principal musical force for the band, searching for methods to\nimprove upon The Rolling Stones' musical textures.[11] He expressed an\nintrigue in incorporating culturally diverse instruments into the band's\nmusic, investigating the [sitar](/wiki/Sitar \"Sitar\"),\n[koto](/wiki/Koto_\\(instrument\\) \"Koto \\(instrument\\)\"),\n[marimba](/wiki/Marimba \"Marimba\"), and testing electronics. In the press\nJones talked about applying the [Appalachian\ndulcimer](/wiki/Appalachian_dulcimer \"Appalachian dulcimer\") into\ncompositions, although he seemed uncertain of the instrument, saying \"It's an\nold English instrument used at the beginning of the century\". The dulcimer was\nfirst brought to his attention in March 1966 when Jones began listening to\nrecordings of [Richard Fariña](/wiki/Richard_Fari%C3%B1a \"Richard Fariña\").\nThe influence of these recordings would manifest itself in _Aftermath_ , where\nJones performed with the dulcimer on two tracks, \"I Am Waiting\" and, more\ndistinctively, \"Lady Jane\". This later contributed to Jones's status as an\nearly pioneer in [world music](/wiki/World_music \"World music\"), and\neffectively shifted the band from [blues rock](/wiki/Blues_rock \"Blues rock\")\nto a versatile pop group.[12][13]\n\n###\nRecording[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lady_Jane_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Recording\")]\n\nThe master recording of \"Lady Jane\" was recorded from 6 to 9 March 1966, at\nRCA Studios in Los Angeles, with [sound engineer](/wiki/Sound_engineer \"Sound\nengineer\") [Dave Hassinger](/wiki/Dave_Hassinger \"Dave Hassinger\") guiding the\nband through the process (despite [Andrew Loog\nOldham](/wiki/Andrew_Loog_Oldham \"Andrew Loog Oldham\") being credited as\nproducer).[14] Mark Brend has indicated that the influence of Fariña's\ndulcimer playing can be clearly heard - most noticeably in Jones's recurring\ncounter-melody to a call and response with Jagger's [vocals](/wiki/Vocals\n\"Vocals\"). Jones plays the instrument in the traditional style, with it placed\non his knees fretted with a biter and plucked with a quill.[12] In addition to\nthe striking dulcimer [motif](/wiki/Motif_\\(music\\) \"Motif \\(music\\)\"), \"Lady\nJane\" is also highlighted by [Jack Nitzche](/wiki/Jack_Nitzche \"Jack\nNitzche\")'s harpsichord accompaniment halfway through the song.[15] \"Lady\nJane\" also exhibits influences of [author](/wiki/Author \"Author\") [Geoffry\nChaucer](/wiki/Geoffry_Chaucer \"Geoffry Chaucer\"), particularly in Jagger's\ncomic vocal delivery and diction. To Richards, \"Lady Jane is very Elizabethan.\nThere are a few places in England where people still speak that way, Chaucer\nEnglish\".[15][16] The vocal melody is set in the [subtonic](/wiki/Subtonic\n\"Subtonic\") range, rather than the conventional major seventh scale degree,\nwhich presents a Renaissance-style modal. Although stylistically the two songs\nhave little in common, the modality connects the Eastern-melody and harmonies\nof \"Lady Jane\" to \"[Paint It Black](/wiki/Paint_It_Black \"Paint It\nBlack\")\".[17]\n\n## Release[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lady_Jane_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Release\")]\n\nIn the U.S., \"Lady Jane\" was the B-side to \"[Mother's Little\nHelper](/wiki/Mother%27s_Little_Helper \"Mother's Little Helper\")\", but \"Lady\nJane\" reached number 24 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart. \"Mother's Little\nHelper\" reached number eight, making the release one of the few singles with\nboth songs becoming hits in the US.[18]\n\n##\nPersonnel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lady_Jane_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Personnel\")]\n\n  * [Mick Jagger](/wiki/Mick_Jagger \"Mick Jagger\") – [lead vocals](/wiki/Lead_vocals \"Lead vocals\")\n  * [Keith Richards](/wiki/Keith_Richards \"Keith Richards\") – [acoustic guitar](/wiki/Acoustic_guitar \"Acoustic guitar\")\n  * [Brian Jones](/wiki/Brian_Jones \"Brian Jones\") – [dulcimer](/wiki/Appalachian_dulcimer \"Appalachian dulcimer\")\n  * [Jack Nitzsche](/wiki/Jack_Nitzsche \"Jack Nitzsche\") – [harpsichord](/wiki/Harpsichord \"Harpsichord\")\n\n## Charts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lady_Jane_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Charts\")]\n\nChart (1966) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nBelgium ([Ultratop 50](/wiki/Ultratop \"Ultratop\") Flanders)[19] | 12  \nCanada Top Singles (_[RPM](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\")_)[20] | 91  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[21] | 24  \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lady_Jane_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Brend, Mark (2005).
