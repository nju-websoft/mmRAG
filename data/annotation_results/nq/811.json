Financial investigations include counterfeit U.S. currency, bank & financial institution fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, illicit financing operations, and major conspiracies. Electronic investigations include cybercrime, network intrusions, identity theft, access device fraud, credit card fraud, and intellectual property crimes. The Secret Service is a key member of the FBI's [Joint Terrorism Task Force](/wiki/Joint_Terrorism_Task_Force \"Joint Terrorism Task Force\") (JTTF) which investigates and combats terrorism on a national and international scale, as well as of the [High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas](/wiki/High_Intensity_Drug_Trafficking_Areas \"High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas\") (HIDTA) task force which seeks to reduce and eliminate drug trafficking in critical regions of the United States. The Service also investigates missing and exploited children and is a core partner of the [National Center for Missing & Exploited Children](/wiki/National_Center_for_Missing_%26_Exploited_Children \"National Center for Missing & Exploited Children\") (NCMEC).[4]\n\n  * **Protective Mission** – The protective mission of the USSS is to ensure the safety of the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, the President's and Vice President's immediate families, former presidents, their spouses, and their minor children under the age of 16, major presidential and vice presidential candidates and their spouses, and foreign heads of state. The USSS also provides physical security for the White House Complex, the neighboring Treasury Department building, the Vice President's residence, and all foreign diplomatic missions in Washington, D.C. The protective mission includes protective operations to coordinate manpower and logistics with state and local law enforcement, protective advances to conduct site and venue assessments for protectees, and protective intelligence to investigate all manners of threats made against protectees. The Secret Service is the lead agency in charge of the planning, coordination, and implementation of security operations for events designated as [National Special Security Events (NSSEs)](/wiki/National_Special_Security_Event \"National Special Security Event\"). As part of the Service's mission of preventing an incident before it occurs, the agency relies on meticulous advance work and threat assessments developed by its Intelligence Division to identify potential risks to protectees.[5]\n\nThe Secret Service's initial responsibility was to investigate the\ncounterfeiting of U.S. currency, which was rampant following the [American\nCivil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\"). The agency then\nevolved into the United States' first domestic intelligence and\n[counterintelligence](/wiki/Counterintelligence \"Counterintelligence\") agency.\nMany of the agency's missions were later taken over by subsequent agencies\nsuch as the [Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation](/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation \"Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation\") (FBI), [Central Intelligence\nAgency](/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency \"Central Intelligence Agency\")\n(CIA), [Drug Enforcement Administration](/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration\n\"Drug Enforcement Administration\") (DEA), [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nFirearms and\nExplosives](/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives \"Bureau\nof Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\") (ATF), and [IRS Criminal\nInvestigation Division](/wiki/IRS_Criminal_Investigation_Division \"IRS\nCriminal Investigation Division\") (IRS-CI).\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Dual mission\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Early years\n    * 2.2 20th century\n      * 2.2.1 Taft assassination attempt\n      * 2.2.2 1950s\n      * 2.2.3 1960s\n      * 2.2.4 1980s\n      * 2.2.5 1990s\n    * 2.3 21st century\n      * 2.3.1 2000s\n        * 2.3.1.1 September 11 attacks\n        * 2.3.1.2 Domestic expansion\n        * 2.3.1.3 International expansion\n      * 2.3.2 2010s\n  * 3 Attacks on presidents\n  * 4 Significant investigations\n  * 5 Structure\n  * 6 Special Agent\n  * 7 Uniformed Division Officer\n  * 8 Special Officer\n  * 9 Weapons and equipment\n    * 9.1 Previous firearms\n    * 9.2 Current weapons\n    * 9.3 Badges\n    * 9.4 Attire\n    * 9.5 Vehicles\n  * 10 Field offices\n  * 11 Misconduct\n  * 12 In popular culture\n    * 12.1 Films\n    * 12.2 Television\n    * 12.3 Video games\n  * 13 Other U.S. federal law enforcement agencies\n  * 14 See also\n  * 15 References\n  * 16 Bibliography\n  * 17 Further reading\n  * 18 External links\n\n## Dual\nmission[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Secret_Service&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Dual mission\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Secret_Service_agents_conducting_investigations.jpg/220px-\nSecret_Service_agents_conducting_investigations.jpg)](/wiki/File:Secret_Service_agents_conducting_investigations.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Secret_Service_agents_conducting_investigations.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSecret Service agents conducting electronic investigations.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/US_Secret_Service_Agent.jpg/220px-\nUS_Secret_Service_Agent.jpg)](/wiki/File:US_Secret_Service_Agent.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:US_Secret_Service_Agent.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSecret Service agents protecting President George W.

The two core missions of investigations\nand protection synergize with the other, providing crucial benefits to special\nagents during the course of their careers. Skills developed during the course\nof investigations which are also used in an agent’s protective duties include\nbut are not limited to:\n\n  * Proficiency in analyzing handwriting and forgery techniques being applied in protective investigations of handwritten letters and suspicious package threats.\n  * Expertise in investigating electronic and financial crimes being applied in protective investigations of threats made against the nation's leaders on the Internet.\n  * Tactical operation (i.e. surveillance, arrests, and search warrants) and law enforcement writing (i.e. affidavits, after action reports, and operations plans) skills being applied to both investigative and protective duties.\n  * Partnerships that are created between field offices and local law enforcement during the course of investigations being used to gather both protective intelligence and in coordinating protection events.\n\nThe Secret Service's primary investigative mission is to protect the payment\nand financial systems of the United States from a wide range of financial and\nelectronic-based crimes including counterfeit U.S. currency, bank & financial\ninstitution fraud, illicit financing operations, cybercrime, identity theft,\nintellectual property crimes, and any other violations that may affect the\nUnited States economy and financial systems. The agency's key focus is on\nlarge, high-dollar economic impact cases involving organized criminal groups.\nFinancial criminals include embezzling bank employees, armed robbers at\nautomatic teller machines, heroin traffickers, and criminal organizations that\ncommit bank fraud on a global scale.\n\nThe USSS plays a leading role in facilitating relationships between other law\nenforcement entities, the private sector, and academia. The Service maintains\nthe Electronic Crimes Task Forces, which focus on identifying and locating\ninternational cyber criminals connected to cyber intrusions, bank fraud, data\nbreaches, and other computer-related crimes. Additionally, the Secret Service\nruns the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI), which provides law\nenforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges with cyber training and\ninformation to combat cybercrime.\n\nProtection of the nation's highest elected leaders and other government\nofficials remains the other key mission of the United States Secret Service.\nAfter the 1901 [assassination of President William\nMcKinley](/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley \"Assassination of William\nMcKinley\"), Congress also directed the Secret Service to protect the\n[President of the United States](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States\n\"President of the United States\").\n\nThe Secret Service is authorized by law to protect:[6]\n\n  * The President, Vice President (or other officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President, should the Vice Presidency be vacant), President-elect and Vice President-elect\n  * The immediate families of the above individuals\n  * Former Presidents and their spouses for their lifetimes (except when the spouse divorces or remarries), under the [Former Presidents Act](/wiki/Former_Presidents_Act \"Former Presidents Act\"). From 1997 until 2013, legislation was in place limiting Secret Service protection to former Presidents and their spouses to a period of 10 years from the date the former President leaves office. President [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\") signed legislation on January 10, 2013, reversing this limit and reinstating lifetime protection.[7][8]\n  * The widow or widower of a former President who dies in office or dies within a year of leaving office for a period of one year after the President's death (the Secretary of Homeland Security can extend the protection time)\n  * Children of former Presidents until age 16 or 10 years after the presidency\n  * Former Vice Presidents, their spouses, and their children under 16 years of age, for up to 6 months from the date the former Vice President leaves office (the Secretary of Homeland Security can extend the protection time)\n  * Visiting heads of states or governments and their spouses traveling with them\n  * Other distinguished foreign visitors to the United States and official representatives of the United States performing special missions abroad, as directed by the President\n  * Major presidential and vice presidential candidates[9]\n  * The spouses of major presidential and vice presidential candidates (within 120 days of a general presidential election)\n  * Other individuals as designated per executive order of the President\n  * [National Special Security Events](/wiki/National_Special_Security_Event \"National Special Security Event\"), when designated as such by the Secretary of Homeland Security\n\nThe laws states that individuals other than the President, the Vice President\n(or other officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President),\nthe President-elect, and the Vice President-elect may decline Secret Service\nprotection, but the law neither allows nor disallows these excepted offices\nfrom declining.[6]\n\nWhen [Hillary Clinton](/wiki/Hillary_Clinton \"Hillary Clinton\") became\n[Secretary of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United States\nSecretary of State\") in 2009, the Secret Service continued to protect her at\nhome; however the [Diplomatic Security\nService](/wiki/Diplomatic_Security_Service \"Diplomatic Security Service\")\nprotected her while she was performing her duties as the Secretary of State,\nincluding foreign travel.\n\nThe Secret Service investigates thousands of incidents each year of\nindividuals [threatening the President of the United\nStates](/wiki/Threatening_the_President_of_the_United_States \"Threatening the\nPresident of the United States\").\n\nIn the face of budget pressure, hiring challenges and some high-profile lapses\nin its protective service role in 2014, the [Brookings\nInstitution](/wiki/Brookings_Institution \"Brookings Institution\") and some\nmembers of Congress are asking whether the agency's focus should shift more to\nthe protective mission, leaving more of its original mission to other\nagencies.[10][11]\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Secret_Service&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Early\nyears[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Secret_Service&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Early years\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Logo_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service.svg/180px-\nLogo_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Logo_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Logo_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLogo of the United States Secret Service\n\nWith a reported one third of the currency in circulation being counterfeit at\nthe time,[12] the Secret Service was created on July 5, 1865 in [Washington,\nD.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\"), to suppress counterfeit\ncurrency. Chief [William P. Wood](/wiki/William_P._Wood \"William P. Wood\") was\nsworn in by [Secretary of the\nTreasury](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury \"United States\nSecretary of the Treasury\") [Hugh McCulloch](/wiki/Hugh_McCulloch \"Hugh\nMcCulloch\"). It was commissioned in Washington, D.C. as the \"Secret Service\nDivision\" of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing\ncounterfeiting. The legislation creating the agency was on [Abraham\nLincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\")'s desk the night he was\n[assassinated](/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln \"Assassination of\nAbraham Lincoln\").[13] At the time, the only other federal law enforcement\nagencies were the [United States Customs\nService](/wiki/United_States_Customs_Service \"United States Customs Service\"),\nthe [United States Park Police](/wiki/United_States_Park_Police \"United States\nPark Police\"), the [U.S. Post Office\nDepartment](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service \"United States Postal\nService\")'s Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (now known as the\n[United States Postal Inspection\nService](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Inspection_Service \"United States Postal\nInspection Service\")), and the [United States Marshals\nService](/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service \"United States Marshals\nService\"). The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime\nunder federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began to investigate\neverything from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling. After the\n[assassination](/wiki/William_McKinley_assassination \"William McKinley\nassassination\") of President [William McKinley](/wiki/William_McKinley\n\"William McKinley\") in 1901, [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United\nStates Congress\") informally requested that the Secret Service provide\npresidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time\nresponsibility for presidential protection. In 1902, [William\nCraig](/wiki/William_Craig_\\(Secret_Service\\) \"William Craig \\(Secret\nService\\)\") became the first Secret Service agent to die while serving, in a\nroad accident while riding in the presidential carriage.\n\nThe Secret Service was the first U.S. domestic intelligence and\ncounterintelligence agency. Domestic intelligence collection and\ncounterintelligence responsibilities were vested in the [Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation](/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation \"Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation\") (FBI) upon the FBI's creation in 1908.\n\nThe Secret Service assisted in arresting Japanese American leaders and in the\n[Japanese American internment](/wiki/Japanese_American_internment \"Japanese\nAmerican internment\") during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War\nII\").[14] The U.S. Secret Service is not a part of the [U.S. Intelligence\nCommunity](/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community \"United States\nIntelligence Community\").[15]\n\n### 20th\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Secret_Service&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 20th century\")]\n\n#### Taft assassination\nattempt[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Secret_Service&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Taft assassination attempt\")]\n\nIn 1909, President [William H.

Moore, and the two\nmen captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and\nTaft, preventing the shooting of both Presidents.[20]\n\n####\n1950s[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Secret_Service&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: 1950s\")]\n\nIn 1950, President [Harry S.

Applicants are directed to list their\noffice location preference during the application process, and upon receiving\na final job offer, usually have several locations to choose from.[51] After\ntheir field office experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective\nassignment where they will stay for three to five years. Following their\nprotective assignment, many agents return to a field office for the rest of\ntheir careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in\nWashington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to\nwork overseas in one of the agency's international field offices. This\ntypically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency\nwhen working alongside the agency's foreign law enforcement counterparts.[51]\n\nSpecial agents are hired at either the GL-07 or GL-09 grade level, depending\non individual qualifications and/or education.[51] Agents are eligible for\npromotion on a yearly basis, from GL-07, to GL-09, to GS-11, to GS-12, to\nGS-13 (GL-08 and GS-10 grade levels are skipped). The full performance grade\nlevel for a journeyman agent is GS-13, which a GL-07 and GL-09 agent may reach\nin as little as four and three years respectively. GS-13 agents are eligible\nfor competitive promotion to supervisory agent positions, which compasses the\nGS-14, GS-15, and SES grade levels. GS-13 agents who wish to remain as senior\nfield agents continue to advance the GS-13 step level, capping at GS-13\nStep-10.\n\nSpecial agents also receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), a type of\npremium overtime pay which provides them with an additional 25% bonus pay on\ntop of their salary, as agents are required to work an average workweek of 50\nhours as opposed to 40.[54] Therefore, an agent living in the Greater New York\nCity area will earn an annual salary of approximately $65,733 (GL-07), $74,850\n(GL-09), $87,639 (GS-11), $105,044 (GS-12), $124,909 (GS-13), $147,606\n(GS-14), and $164,200 (GS-15).[55]\n\nMoreover, due to the nature of their work and unique among their federal law\nenforcement counterparts (e.g. FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE), Secret Service agents are\nregularly eligible for scheduled overtime pay (SOT pay) in addition to LEAP\nfor hours they work beyond 50 per week, and enjoy a raised statutory pay cap\nof $189,600 per year (Level II of the Executive Schedule) as opposed to\n$164,200 per year (Level IV of the Executive Schedule).[56]\n\n## Uniformed Division\nOfficer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Secret_Service&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Uniformed Division Officer\")]\n\nMain article: [United States Secret Service Uniformed\nDivision](/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service_Uniformed_Division \"United States\nSecret Service Uniformed Division\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Secret_Service_officer_and_his_police_dog_as_part_of_the_Emergency_Response_Team_%28ERT%29.png/220px-\nSecret_Service_officer_and_his_police_dog_as_part_of_the_Emergency_Response_Team_%28ERT%29.png)](/wiki/File:Secret_Service_officer_and_his_police_dog_as_part_of_the_Emergency_Response_Team_\\(ERT\\).png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Secret_Service_officer_and_his_police_dog_as_part_of_the_Emergency_Response_Team_\\(ERT\\).png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nSecret Service officer and his police dog as part of the Emergency Response\nTeam (ERT)\n\nThe Secret Service Uniformed Division is a [security\npolice](/wiki/Security_police \"Security police\") similar to the [U.S. Capitol\nPolice](/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police \"United States Capitol Police\") or\n[DHS Federal Protective\nService](/wiki/Federal_Protective_Service_\\(United_States\\) \"Federal\nProtective Service \\(United States\\)\") and is in charge of protecting the\nphysical [White House](/wiki/White_House \"White House\") grounds and foreign\ndiplomatic missions in the [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C.\n\"Washington, D.C.\") area.
