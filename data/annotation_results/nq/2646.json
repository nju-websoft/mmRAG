Since only one [Vince Lombardi\nTrophy](/wiki/Vince_Lombardi_Trophy \"Vince Lombardi Trophy\") is awarded to the\nteam (ownership) itself, the Super Bowl ring offers a collectable memento for\nthe actual players and team members to keep for themselves to symbolise their\nvictory.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Details\n  * 2 Value and resale\n  * 3 Most Super Bowl rings\n  * 4 Players with Super Bowl and Grey Cup rings\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Details[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_ring&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Details\")]\n\nThese rings are typically made of [yellow](/wiki/Gold \"Gold\") or [white\ngold](/wiki/White_gold \"White gold\") with [diamonds](/wiki/Diamonds\n\"Diamonds\"). They usually include the team name, team logo, and Super Bowl\nnumber (usually indicated in [Roman numerals](/wiki/Roman_numeral \"Roman\nnumeral\")). The NFL contributes up to $5,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for\nthe winning team; any additional costs are borne by the team.[1] Most rings\nare manufactured by memorabilia company [Jostens](/wiki/Jostens \"Jostens\"). In\n2015, the rings for the New England Patriots reportedly cost $36,500 each,\nmaking them the most expensive rings Jostens has ever produced.[2]\n\nThe winning team can typically present rings to whomever they choose,\nincluding usually, but not limited to: players (active roster or injured),\ncoaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general staff. Some teams have\ngiven rings to former players and coaches that were on the team at some point\nduring the season, despite not having been on the winning roster for the Super\nBowl itself.[3][4] Sometimes a team will give rings to fans as part of a\ncharity raffle.[5] Teams can distribute any number of rings. A recent trend\nover the last 15–20 years has been lesser rings awarded to front office staff.\nThese are commonly called \"B\" and \"C\" level rings and are smaller and contain\nfewer diamonds or contain faux diamonds. The first instance of this was the\n[Redskins](/wiki/Washington_Redskins \"Washington Redskins\") [Super Bowl\nXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XVII \"Super Bowl XVII\") ring when many in the front\noffice received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia\nstones (which resemble diamonds). When [Tampa Bay](/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers\n\"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\") won [Super Bowl XXXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVII \"Super\nBowl XXXVII\"), the players and coaches received rings with a diamond-centered\nLombardi trophy. Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy and\nreal diamonds surrounding the trophy and the \"C\" level ring did not contain\nany diamonds.\n\nMany rings feature diamonds in the shape of the [Vince Lombardi\nTrophy](/wiki/Vince_Lombardi_Trophy \"Vince Lombardi Trophy\") or a\n[football](/wiki/American_football_ball \"American football ball\"). Some\nfeature diamonds or gold in the shape of a team logo. Others illustrate the\nnumber of Super Bowls that franchise has won. Also, the rings are customized\nwith the player's name and uniform number.\n\nThe [Green Bay Packers](/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers \"Green Bay Packers\") [Super\nBowl XLV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLV \"Super Bowl XLV\") ring[6] contained more than\n100 diamonds. The Packer logo, in the center of the ring, made up 13 diamonds,\none for each title the team has won, dating back to 1929. In a break from\ntradition, this is the first Super Bowl ring to be made of\n[platinum](/wiki/Platinum \"Platinum\"), not gold.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe [New England Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\")\n[Super Bowl LI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_LI \"Super Bowl LI\") ring has 283 diamonds, to\ncommemorate their comeback from being down 28-3 versus the [Atlanta\nFalcons](/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons \"Atlanta Falcons\") late in the 3rd quarter.[7]\n\n## Value and\nresale[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_ring&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Value and resale\")]\n\nReplicas of the rings for various years are popular collectibles, along with\ngenuine rings. [Dave Meggett](/wiki/Dave_Meggett \"Dave Meggett\") is known to\nhave placed his ring for sale on [eBay](/wiki/EBay \"EBay\"). Two Super Bowl\nrings from the 1970 [Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh\nSteelers\") sold on eBay for over $69,000 apiece in mid-2008.[8]\n[Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\") safety [Je'Rod\nCherry](/wiki/Je%27Rod_Cherry \"Je'Rod Cherry\") raffled his ring from [Super\nBowl XXXVI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVI \"Super Bowl XXXVI\") in November 2008 to\nbenefit several charities working to help children in Africa and Asia.[9]\nTight end [Shannon Sharpe](/wiki/Shannon_Sharpe \"Shannon Sharpe\"), meanwhile,\ngave his [first](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXII \"Super Bowl XXXII\") Super Bowl ring to\nhis brother [Sterling](/wiki/Sterling_Sharpe \"Sterling Sharpe\"), who had his\ncareer cut short by injury.[10]\n\nIn 2011, a Super Bowl ring belonging to Steve Wright, a lineman for the Green\nBay Packers in the 1960s, sold for over $73,000 at auction. Three Super Bowl\nrings belonging to former Raiders' [punter](/wiki/Punter_\\(football\\) \"Punter\n\\(football\\)\") [Ray Guy](/wiki/Ray_Guy \"Ray Guy\") brought over $96,000 at\nauction. In 2012, [Lawrence Taylor](/wiki/Lawrence_Taylor \"Lawrence Taylor\")'s\nson sold his father's Super Bowl ring from 1990 for more than $250,000.\n\n## Most Super Bowl\nrings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_ring&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Most Super Bowl rings\")]\n\n  * **Seven** : two people. \n    * [Bill Belichick](/wiki/Bill_Belichick \"Bill Belichick\"): two as [defensive coordinator](/wiki/Defensive_coordinator \"Defensive coordinator\") of the [New York Giants](/wiki/New_York_Giants \"New York Giants\") and five as [head coach](/wiki/Head_coach \"Head coach\") of [New England Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\")\n    * [Neal Dahlen](/wiki/Neal_Dahlen \"Neal Dahlen\"):[11][12] five with [San Francisco 49ers](/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers \"San Francisco 49ers\") (staff and player personnel) and two with [Denver Broncos](/wiki/Denver_Broncos \"Denver Broncos\") (general manager)\n  * **Six** : six people. \n    * [Dan Rooney](/wiki/Dan_Rooney \"Dan Rooney\") and [Art Rooney II](/wiki/Art_Rooney_II \"Art Rooney II\"): each as an executive with [Pittsburgh Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")\n    * [Chuck Noll](/wiki/Chuck_Noll \"Chuck Noll\"): four as head coach and two as a team consultant with [Pittsburgh Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")\n    * [Bill Nunn](/wiki/Bill_Nunn_\\(American_football\\) \"Bill Nunn \\(American football\\)\"): each as a scout with [Pittsburgh Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")[13][14]\n    * [\"Mean Joe\" Greene](/wiki/Joe_Greene_\\(American_football\\) \"Joe Greene \\(American football\\)\"): four as a [defensive tackle](/wiki/Defensive_tackle \"Defensive tackle\"), two as a special assistant for player personnel, all with the [Pittsburgh Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")[15]\n    * [Conditioning coach](/wiki/Athletic_trainer \"Athletic trainer\") [Mike Woicik](/wiki/Mike_Woicik \"Mike Woicik\"): three with [Dallas Cowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\") and three with [New England Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\")\n  * **Five** : twenty people. \n    * [Charles Haley](/wiki/Charles_Haley \"Charles Haley\"), five (two as a linebacker with the [San Francisco 49ers](/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers \"San Francisco 49ers\") and three as a defensive end with the [Dallas Cowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\"))\n    * [Tom Brady](/wiki/Tom_Brady \"Tom Brady\"), five as starting quarterback with [New England Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\"); he has the most rings of any active player (as of the end of the 2017–18 season), he is the only player to win five playing for one team, and he has more than any other quarterback in Super Bowl history.\n    * [Robert Kraft](/wiki/Robert_Kraft \"Robert Kraft\"), five as owner of [New England Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\")\n    * [Edward J.
