The death of [Queen Victoria](/wiki/Queen_Victoria \"Queen\nVictoria\") in January 1901 marked the end of the [Victorian\nera](/wiki/Victorian_era \"Victorian era\"). The new king Edward VII was already\nthe leader of a fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and\nfashions of continental Europe. [Samuel Hynes](/wiki/Samuel_Hynes \"Samuel\nHynes\") described the Edwardian era as a \"leisurely time when women wore\n[picture hats](/wiki/Picture_hat \"Picture hat\") and did not vote, when the\nrich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun really never set on\nthe British flag'\".[1] The Liberals returned to power in\n[1906](/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1906 \"United Kingdom general\nelection, 1906\") and made [significant reforms](/wiki/Liberal_welfare_reforms\n\"Liberal welfare reforms\"). Below the upper class, the era was marked by\nsignificant shifts in politics among sections of society that were largely\nexcluded from wielding power in the past, such as common labourers.

This perception was\ncreated in the 1920s and later by those who remembered the Edwardian age with\nnostalgia, looking back to their childhoods across the abyss of the [Great\nWar](/wiki/Great_War \"Great War\").[3] The Edwardian age was also seen as a\nmediocre period of pleasure between the great achievements of the preceding\nVictorian age and the catastrophe of the following war.[4] Since 2000\nhistoriographical assessments emphasise the great differences between the\nwealthy and the poor during this period and describe the age as heralding\ngreat changes in political and social life.[2][5] Historian [Lawrence\nJames](/wiki/Lawrence_James \"Lawrence James\") has argued that the leaders felt\nincreasingly threatened by rival powers such as Germany, Russia, and the\nUnited States.[6] The sudden arrival of world war in summer 1914 was\ncompletely unexpected; only the Royal Navy was prepared for war.\n\n## Politics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Politics\")]\n\nThere was a growing political awareness of the [working-class](/wiki/Working-\nclass \"Working-class\"), leading to a rise in [trade unions](/wiki/Trade_unions\n\"Trade unions\"), the [Labour movement](/wiki/Labour_movement \"Labour\nmovement\") and demands for better working conditions. The aristocracy remained\nin control of top government offices.[7]\n\n### Conservative\nParty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Conservative Party\")]\n\nMain article: [History of the Conservative Party\n(UK)](/wiki/History_of_the_Conservative_Party_\\(UK\\) \"History of the\nConservative Party \\(UK\\)\")\n\nThe [Conservatives](/wiki/Conservative_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Conservative Party\n\\(UK\\)\") – at the time called \"Unionists\" – were the dominant political party\nfrom the 1890s until [1906](/wiki/1906_UK_general_election \"1906 UK general\nelection\"). The party had many strengths, appealing to voters supportive of\n[imperialism](/wiki/Imperialism \"Imperialism\"), tariffs, the [Church of\nEngland](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of England\"), a powerful [Royal\nNavy](/wiki/Royal_Navy \"Royal Navy\"), and traditional hierarchical society.\nThere was a powerful leadership base in the landed aristocracy and landed\ngentry in rural England, plus strong support from the Church of England and\nmilitary interests. Historians have used election returns to demonstrate that\nConservatives did surprisingly well in working-class districts.[8][9] They had\nan appeal as well to the better-off element of traditional working-class\nBritons in the larger cities.[10] In rural areas, the national headquarters\nmade highly effective use of paid traveling lecturers, with pamphlets,\nposters, and especially lantern slides, who were able to communicate\neffectively with rural voters – particularly the newly enfranchised\nagricultural workers.[11] In the first years of the twentieth century, the\nConservative government, with [Arthur Balfour](/wiki/Arthur_Balfour \"Arthur\nBalfour\") as [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom\n\"Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\"), had numerous successes in foreign\npolicy, defence, and education, as well as solutions for the issues of alcohol\nlicensing and land ownership for the peasants of Ireland.[12]\n\nNevertheless, the weaknesses were accumulating, and proved so overwhelming in\n1906 that they did not return to complete power until\n[1922](/wiki/1922_UK_general_election \"1922 UK general election\").[13] The\nConservative Party was losing its drive and enthusiasm, especially after the\nretirement of the charismatic [Joseph Chamberlain](/wiki/Joseph_Chamberlain\n\"Joseph Chamberlain\"). There was a bitter split on [\"tariff\nreform\"](/wiki/Protectionism \"Protectionism\") (that is, imposing tariffs or\ntaxes on all imports), that drove many of the free traders over to the\n[Liberal](/wiki/Liberal_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Liberal Party \\(UK\\)\") camp. Tariff\nreform was a losing issue that the Conservative leadership inexplicably clung\nto.[14] Support among the top tier of the working-class, and in lower middle-\nclass weakened, and there was dissatisfaction among the intellectuals. The\n1906 general election was a landslide victory for the Liberal Party, which saw\nits total vote share increase by 25%, while the Conservative total vote held\nsteady.[15]\n\n### Liberal\nParty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Liberal Party\")]\n\nMain article: [Liberal Party (UK)](/wiki/Liberal_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Liberal Party\n\\(UK\\)\")\n\nThe Liberal Party lacked a unified ideological base in 1906.[16] It contained\nnumerous contradictory and hostile factions, such as imperialists and\nsupporters of the Boers;[17] near-socialists and laissez-faire classical\nliberals; suffragettes and opponents of women's suffrage;[18] antiwar elements\nand supporters of the military alliance with France.[19] Non-Conformist\nDissenters – Protestants outside the Anglican fold – were a powerful element,\ndedicated to opposing the established church in terms of education and\ntaxation. However, the Dissenters were losing support and society at large and\nplayed a lesser and lesser role in party affairs after 1900.[20] The Party,\nfurthermore, also included [Irish Catholics](/wiki/Irish_Catholics \"Irish\nCatholics\"), and secularists from the labour movement. The middle-class\nbusiness, professional and intellectual communities were generally\nstrongholds, although some old aristocratic families played important roles as\nwell. The working-class element was moving rapidly toward the newly emerging\n[Labour Party](/wiki/Labour_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Labour Party \\(UK\\)\"). One uniting\nelement was widespread agreement on the use of politics and Parliament as a\ndevice to upgrade and improve society and to reform politics.[21]\n\n### Labour Party[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Labour Party\")]\n\nMain article: [History of the Labour Party\n(UK)](/wiki/History_of_the_Labour_Party_\\(UK\\) \"History of the Labour Party\n\\(UK\\)\")\n\nThe Labour Party was emerging from the rapidly growing trade union movement\nafter 1890. In 1903 it entered the [Gladstone–MacDonald\npact](/wiki/Gladstone%E2%80%93MacDonald_pact \"Gladstone–MacDonald pact\") with\nthe Liberals, allowing for cross-party support in elections, and the emergence\nof a small Labour contingent in Parliament. It was a temporary arrangement\nuntil the 1920s, when the Labour Party was strong enough to act on its own,\nand the Liberals were in an irreversible decline. Subtle social changes in the\nworking-class were producing a younger generation that wanted to act\nindependently. Michael Childs argues that the younger generation had reason to\nprefer Labour over Liberal political styles. Social factors included\nsecularised elementary education (with a disappearing role for Dissenting\nschools that inculcated Liberal viewpoints); the \"New Unionism\" after 1890\nbrought unskilled workers into a movement previously dominated by the skilled\nworkers;[22] and new leisure activities, especially the [music\nhall](/wiki/Music_hall \"Music hall\") and sports, involved youth while\nrepelling the older generation of Liberal voters.[23]\n\n### Boer War[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Boer War\")]\n\nMain article: [Opposition to the Second Boer\nWar](/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Second_Boer_War \"Opposition to the Second Boer\nWar\")\n\nThe government entered the [Second Boer War](/wiki/Second_Boer_War \"Second\nBoer War\") with great confidence, little expecting that the two small rural\nBoer republics in southern Africa with a combined White population less than\nLondon would hold off the concentrated power of the [British\nEmpire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") for two and half years, and\ntake 400,000 Imperial troops to secure victory.[24] The war split the Liberal\nParty into anti- and pro-war factions. Great orators, such as Liberal [David\nLloyd George](/wiki/David_Lloyd_George \"David Lloyd George\"), who spoke\nagainst the war, became increasingly influential. Nevertheless Liberal\nUnionist [Joseph Chamberlain](/wiki/Joseph_Chamberlain \"Joseph Chamberlain\"),\nwho was largely in charge of the war, maintained his hold on power. When\n[General Kitchener](/wiki/Herbert_Kitchener \"Herbert Kitchener\") took command\nin 1900, he initiated a scorched earth policy in order to foil Boer guerilla\ntactics. Captured Boer combatants were transported overseas to other British\npossessions as prisoners of war. However he relocated noncombatant\nBoers—mostly women and children—into heavily guarded internment camps. The\ninternment camps were overcrowded with bad sanitation and meagre food rations.\nContagious diseases such as measles, typhoid and dysentery were endemic. Many\nof the internees died. [Emily Hobhouse](/wiki/Emily_Hobhouse \"Emily Hobhouse\")\nvisited the camps and brought the conditions to the attention of the British\npublic. Public outcry resulted in the [Fawcett\nCommission](/wiki/Millicent_Fawcett \"Millicent Fawcett\") which corroborated\nHobhouse's report and eventually led to improved conditions.[25] The Boers\nsurrendered and the Boer Republics were annexed by the British Empire. [Jan\nSmuts](/wiki/Jan_Smuts \"Jan Smuts\")—a leading Boer general—became a senior\nofficial of the new government and even became a top British official in the\nWorld War.[26]\n\nIn 1901, the six British self-governing colonies of Queensland, New South\nWales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia united to\nform the Commonwealth of Australia, with almost complete control of its\ninternal affairs, but with foreign policy and defence handled by London.\n[Edmund Barton](/wiki/Edmund_Barton \"Edmund Barton\") was the first prime\nminister.[27]\n\n### The Liberal\nreforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: The Liberal reforms\")]\n\nFurther information: [Liberal welfare reforms](/wiki/Liberal_welfare_reforms\n\"Liberal welfare reforms\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Ten_Years_of_Toryism.jpg/220px-\nTen_Years_of_Toryism.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ten_Years_of_Toryism.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ten_Years_of_Toryism.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLiberal poster c.1905–10\n\nThe [Liberal Party](/wiki/Liberal_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Liberal Party \\(UK\\)\") under\n[Henry Campbell-Bannerman](/wiki/Henry_Campbell-Bannerman \"Henry Campbell-\nBannerman\") rallied Liberals around the traditional platform of free trade and\nland reform and led them to [the greatest electoral\nvictory](/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1906 \"United Kingdom general\nelection, 1906\") in Liberal Party history.[28] The [Prime\nMinister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Prime Minister of the\nUnited Kingdom\") was overshadowed by his frontbench, most notably [H. H.\nAsquith](/wiki/H._H._Asquith \"H. H.

Campbell-Bannerman retired in\n1908 and was succeeded by Asquith. He stepped up the government's radicalism,\nespecially in the \"[People's Budget](/wiki/People%27s_Budget \"People's\nBudget\")\" of 1909 that proposed to fund expanded social welfare programmes\nwith new taxes on land and high incomes. It was blocked by the Conservative-\ndominated [House of Lords](/wiki/House_of_Lords \"House of Lords\"), but\neventually became law in April 1910.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Asquith_Q_42036.jpg/220px-\nAsquith_Q_42036.jpg)](/wiki/File:Asquith_Q_42036.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Asquith_Q_42036.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[H.

At first it applied to four industries:\nchain-making, ready-made tailoring, paper-box making, and the machine-made\nlace and finishing trade.[31] It was later expanded to coal mining and then to\nother industries with preponderance of unskilled manual labour by the [Trade\nBoards Act 1918](/wiki/Trade_Boards_Act_1918 \"Trade Boards Act 1918\"). Under\nthe leadership of [David Lloyd George](/wiki/David_Lloyd_George \"David Lloyd\nGeorge\") Liberals extended minimum wages to farm workers.[32]\n\nConservative peers in the House of Lords tried to stop the [People's\nBudget](/wiki/People%27s_Budget \"People's Budget\"). The Liberals passed the\n[Parliament Act 1911](/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911 \"Parliament Act 1911\") to\nsharply reduce the power of the [House of Lords](/wiki/House_of_Lords \"House\nof Lords\") to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government\nwas required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its\nposition and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, with the\nbalance of power held by [Labour](/wiki/Labour_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Labour Party\n\\(UK\\)\") and [Irish Parliamentary Party](/wiki/Irish_Parliamentary_Party\n\"Irish Parliamentary Party\") members.\n\n## Foreign\nrelations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Foreign relations\")]\n\nMain articles: [International relations of the Great Powers\n(1814–1919)](/wiki/International_relations_of_the_Great_Powers_\\(1814%E2%80%931919\\)\n\"International relations of the Great Powers \\(1814–1919\\)\"), [Causes of World\nWar I](/wiki/Causes_of_World_War_I \"Causes of World War I\"), and [Timeline of\nBritish diplomatic history](/wiki/Timeline_of_British_diplomatic_history\n\"Timeline of British diplomatic history\")\n\n### Diplomatic ties with France and Russia against\nGermany[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Diplomatic ties with France and Russia against Germany\")]\n\nMain articles: [France–United Kingdom\nrelations](/wiki/France%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations \"France–United\nKingdom relations\") and [Germany–United Kingdom\nrelations](/wiki/Germany%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations \"Germany–United\nKingdom relations\")\n\nGermany's Chancellor [Otto von Bismarck](/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck \"Otto von\nBismarck\") dominated European diplomacy from 1872-1890, with the determination\nto use the balance of power to keep the peace. There were no wars. Bismarck\nwas removed by an aggressive young Kaiser Wilhelm in 1890, effectively\ndecentralizing the Bismarckian Order that had been shrewdly managed and\nempowering French efforts to isolate Germany. With the formation of the\n[Triple Entente](/wiki/Triple_Entente \"Triple Entente\"), Germany began to feel\nencircled: to the West lay France, with whom rivalry was awakening after a\ngeneration of dormancy following the Franco-Prussian War, to the East sat\nRussia, whose rapid industrialization worried leaders across the Continent,\nand in the seas, British primacy threatened a unified Germany's efforts to\ndevelop its ports and maintain its new global empire.[33] [Joseph\nChamberlain](/wiki/Joseph_Chamberlain \"Joseph Chamberlain\"), who played a\nmajor role in foreign policy in the late 1890s under the Salisbury government,\nrepeatedly tried to open talks with Germany about some sort of an alliance.\nGermany was not interested.[34] Meanwhile Paris went to great pains to woo\nRussia and Great Britain. Key markers were the [Franco-Russian\nAlliance](/wiki/Franco-Russian_Alliance \"Franco-Russian Alliance\") of 1894,\nthe 1904 [Entente Cordiale](/wiki/Entente_Cordiale \"Entente Cordiale\") linking\nFrance and Great Britain, and finally the [Anglo-Russian Entente](/wiki/Anglo-\nRussian_Entente \"Anglo-Russian Entente\") in 1907 which became the [Triple\nEntente](/wiki/Triple_Entente \"Triple Entente\"). France thus had a formal\nalliance with Russia, and an informal alignment with Britain, against Germany\nand Austria.[35] By 1903 good relations had been established with the United\nStates and Japan.[36]\n\nBritain abandoned the policy of holding aloof from the continental powers, so\ncalled \"[Splendid Isolation](/wiki/Splendid_Isolation \"Splendid Isolation\")\",\nin the 1900s after being isolated during the [Boer War](/wiki/Boer_War \"Boer\nWar\"). Britain concluded agreements, limited to colonial affairs, with her two\nmajor colonial rivals: the [Entente Cordiale](/wiki/Entente_Cordiale \"Entente\nCordiale\") with France in 1904 and the [Anglo-Russian Entente](/wiki/Anglo-\nRussian_Entente \"Anglo-Russian Entente\") of 1907. Britain's alignment a\nreaction to an assertive German foreign policy and the buildup of its navy\nfrom 1898 which led to the [Anglo-German naval arms race](/wiki/Anglo-\nGerman_naval_arms_race \"Anglo-German naval arms race\").[37] British diplomat\n[Arthur Nicolson](/wiki/Arthur_Nicolson,_1st_Baron_Carnock \"Arthur Nicolson,\n1st Baron Carnock\") argued it was \"far more disadvantageous to us to have an\nunfriendly France and Russia than an unfriendly Germany\".[38] The impact of\nthe Triple Entente was to improve British relations with France and its ally\nRussia and to demote the importance to Britain of good relations with Germany.\nAfter 1905, foreign policy was tightly controlled by The Liberal foreign\nminister [Edward Grey](/wiki/Edward_Grey,_1st_Viscount_Grey_of_Fallodon\n\"Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon\") (1862-1933), who seldom\nconsulted with his party leadership. Grey shared the strong Liberal policy\nagainst all wars and against military alliances that would force Britain to\ntake a side in war. However, in the case of the Boer War, Grey held that the\nBoers had committed an aggression that it was necessary to repulse. The\nLiberal party split on the issue, with a large faction strongly opposed to the\nwar in Africa [39]\n\nThe Triple Entente between Britain, France and Russia is often compared to the\n[Triple Alliance](/wiki/Triple_Alliance_\\(1882\\) \"Triple Alliance \\(1882\\)\")\nbetween Germany, Austria–Hungary and Italy, but historians caution against the\ncomparison. The Entente, in contrast to the Triple Alliance or the [Franco-\nRussian Alliance](/wiki/Franco-Russian_Alliance \"Franco-Russian Alliance\"),\nwas not an alliance of mutual defence and Britain therefore felt free to make\nher own foreign policy decisions in 1914. The Liberals were highly moralistic,\nand by 1914 they have been increasingly convinced that German aggression\nviolated international norms, and specifically that its invasion of neutral\nBelgium was completely unacceptable in terms of morality, Britain and\nGermany's obligations under the [Treaty of\nLondon](/wiki/Treaty_of_London_\\(1839\\) \"Treaty of London \\(1839\\)\"), and in\nterms of British policy against any one power controlling the continent of\nEurope.[40]\n\nUntil the last few weeks before it started in August 1914, almost no one saw a\nworld war coming. The expectation among the generals was that because of\nindustrial advances any future war would produce a quick victory for the side\nthat was better-prepared, better armed, and faster to move. No one saw that\nthe innovations of recent decades—high explosives, long-range artillery and\nmachine guns—were defensive weapons that practically guaranteed defeat of\nmassed infantry attacks with very high casualties.[41]\n\n### Naval race with\nGermany[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Naval race with Germany\")]\n\nMain article: [Anglo-German naval arms race](/wiki/Anglo-\nGerman_naval_arms_race \"Anglo-German naval arms race\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/HMS_Dreadnought_1906_H61017.jpg/300px-\nHMS_Dreadnought_1906_H61017.jpg)](/wiki/File:HMS_Dreadnought_1906_H61017.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HMS_Dreadnought_1906_H61017.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe British _Dreadnought_ (1906) made all battleships obsolete because it had\nten long-range 12-inch big guns, mechanical computer-like range finders, high\nspeed turbine engines that could make 21 knots, and armour plates 11 inches\nthick.\n\nAfter 1805 the dominance of Britain's Royal Navy was unchallenged; in the\n1890s Germany decided to match it. Grand Admiral [Alfred von\nTirpitz](/wiki/Alfred_von_Tirpitz \"Alfred von Tirpitz\") (1849 – 1930)\ndominated German naval policy from 1897 until 1916.[42] Before the Germany\nEmpire formed in 1871, Prussia never had a real navy, nor did the other German\nstates. Tirpitz turned the modest little fleet into a world-class force that\ncould threaten the British Royal Navy. The British responded with new\ntechnology typified by the [Dreadnought\nrevolution](/wiki/HMS_Dreadnought_\\(1906\\) \"HMS Dreadnought \\(1906\\)\"). It\nmade every battleship obsolete and, supplemented by the global network of\ncoaling stations and telegraph cables, enabled Britain to stay well in the\nlead in naval affairs.[43][44]\n\nApart from a determination to retain a strong naval advantage, the British\nlacked a military strategy or plans for a major war. [45]\n\n## Economy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Economy\")]\n\nThe Edwardian era stands out as a time of peace and prosperity. There were no\nsevere depressions, and prosperity was widespread. Britain's growth rate,\nmanufacturing output and [GDP](/wiki/GDP \"GDP\") (but not GDP per capita) fell\nbehind its rivals, the United States and Germany, but the nation still led the\nworld in trade, finance and shipping, and had strong bases in manufacturing\nand mining.[46] The industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes,\nand there was a striking preference for leisure over entrepreneurship among\nthe elite. However, major achievements should be underlined.\n[London](/wiki/London \"London\") was the financial centre of the world—far more\nefficient and wide-ranging than New York, Paris or Berlin. Britain had built\nup a vast reserve of overseas credits in its formal Empire, as well as in its\ninformal empire in Latin America and other nations. It had huge financial\nholdings in the United States, especially in railways. These assets proved\nvital in paying for supplies in the first years of the World War. The\namenities, especially in urban life, were accumulating—prosperity was highly\nvisible. The working classes were beginning to protest politically for a\ngreater voice in government, but the level of industrial unrest on economic\nissues was not high until about 1908.[47]\n\n## Social change and improved\nhealth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Social change and improved health\")]\n\nBy the late-1880s, the [Industrial Revolution](/wiki/Industrial_Revolution\n\"Industrial Revolution\") had created new technologies that changed the way\npeople lived. The growth of industry shifts in manufacturing factories,\nspecial-purpose machinery and technological innovations, which led to\nincreased productivity. [Gender roles](/wiki/Gender_roles \"Gender roles\")\nshifted as women made use of the new technology to upgrade their lifestyle and\ntheir career opportunities.\n\nMortality declined steadily in urban England and Wales 1870–1917. Robert\nMillward and Frances N. Bell looked statistically at those factors in the\nphysical environment (especially population density and overcrowding) that\nraised death rates directly, as well as indirect factors such as price and\nincome movements that affected expenditures on sewers, water supplies, food,\nand medical staff. The statistical data show that increases in the incomes of\nhouseholds and increases in town tax revenues helped cause the decline of\nmortality. The new money permitted higher spending on food, and also on a wide\nrange of health-enhancing goods and services such as medical care. The major\nimprovement in the physical environment was the quality of the housing stock,\nwhich rose faster than the population; its quality was increasingly regulated\nby central and local government.[48] [Infant mortality](/wiki/Infant_mortality\n\"Infant mortality\") fell faster in England and Wales than in Scotland. Clive\nLee argues that one factor was the continued overcrowding in Scotland's\nhousing.[49] During the First World War, infant mortality fell sharply across\nthe country. J.M. Winter attributes this to the full employment and higher\nwages paid to war workers.[50]\n\n### Rising status of\nwomen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Rising status of women\")]\n\nFor housewives, sewing machines enabled the production of ready made clothing\nand made it easier for women to sew their own clothes; more generally, argues\nBarbara Burman, \"home dressmaking was sustained as an important aid for women\nnegotiating wider social shifts and tensions in their lives.\"[51] Increased\nliteracy in the [middle-class](/wiki/Middle-class \"Middle-class\") gave women\nwider access to information and ideas. Numerous new magazines appealed to her\ntastes and help define femininity.[52]\n\nThe inventions of the typewriter, telephone, and new filing systems offered\nmiddle-class women increased employment opportunities.[53][54] So too did the\nrapid expansion of the school system,[55] and the emergence of the new\nprofession of nursing. Education and status led to demands for female roles in\nthe rapidly expanding world of sports.[56]\n\nWomen were very active in church affairs, including attendance at services,\nSunday school teaching, fund raising, pastoral care, social work and support\nfor international missionary activities. They quietly submitted to their\nalmost complete exclusion from practically all leadership roles.[57]\n\n#### Women's\nsuffrage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Women's suffrage\")]\n\nMain article: [Women's suffrage in the United\nKingdom](/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Women's suffrage in\nthe United Kingdom\")\n\nAs middle-class women rose in status they increasingly supported demands for a\npolitical voice.[58][59] There was significant support for woman suffrage in\nall the parties, but the Liberal Party was in control after 1906 and a handful\nof its leaders, especially [H. H. Asquith](/wiki/H._H._Asquith \"H. H.\nAsquith\"), blocked it.[60]\n\nThere were numerous organisations which did their work quietly. After 1897\nthey were increasingly linked together by the [National Union of Women's\nSuffrage Societies](/wiki/National_Union_of_Women%27s_Suffrage_Societies\n\"National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies\") (NUWSS) led by [Millicent\nFawcett](/wiki/Millicent_Fawcett \"Millicent Fawcett\"). However front page\npublicity was seized by the [Women's Social and Political\nUnion](/wiki/Women%27s_Social_and_Political_Union \"Women's Social and\nPolitical Union\") (WSPU). Founded in 1903, it was tightly controlled by the\nthree Pankhursts, [Emmeline Pankhurst](/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst \"Emmeline\nPankhurst\") (1858–1928), and her daughters [Christabel\nPankhurst](/wiki/Christabel_Pankhurst \"Christabel Pankhurst\") (1880–1958) and\n[Sylvia Pankhurst](/wiki/Sylvia_Pankhurst \"Sylvia Pankhurst\") (1882–1960).[61]\nIt specialized in highly visible publicity campaigns such as large parades.\nThis had the effect of energizing all dimensions of the suffrage movement.\nWhile there was a majority of support for suffrage in parliament, the ruling\nLiberal Party refused to allow a vote on the issue; the result of which was an\nescalation in the suffragette campaign. The WSPU, in dramatic contrast to its\nallies, embarked on a campaign of violence to publicize the issue, even to the\ndetriment of its own aims.[62][63]\n\n#### Birth\ncontrol[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Birth control\")]\n\nAlthough abortion was illegal, it was nevertheless the most widespread form of\nbirth control in use.[64] Used predominantly by [working-class](/wiki/Working-\nclass \"Working-class\") women, the procedure was used not only as a means of\nterminating pregnancy, but also to prevent poverty and unemployment. Those who\ntransported [contraceptives](/wiki/Contraceptive \"Contraceptive\") could be\nlegally punished. Contraceptives became more expensive over time and had a\nhigh failure rate. Unlike contraceptives, abortion did not need any prior\nplanning and was less expensive. Newspaper advertisements were used to promote\nand sell [abortifacients](/wiki/Abortifacient \"Abortifacient\") indirectly.[65]\n\nNot all of society was accepting of contraceptives or abortion, and the\nopposition viewed both as part of one and the same sin. Abortion was much more\ncommon among the middle-classes than among those living in rural areas, where\nthe procedure was not readily available. Women were often tricked into\npurchasing ineffective pills. In addition to fearing legal reprimands, many\nphysicians did not condone abortion because they viewed it as an immoral\nprocedure potentially endangering a woman's life.[65] Because abortion was\nillegal and physicians refused to perform the procedure, local women acted as\nabortionists, often using crochet hooks or similar instruments.[64]\n\nFeminists of the era focused on educating and finding jobs for women, leaving\naside the controversial issues of contraceptives and abortion, which in\npopular opinion were often related to promiscuity and prostitution. The Church\ncondemned abortion as immoral and a form of rebellion against the child-\nbearing role women were expected to assume. Many considered abortion to be a\nselfish act that allowed a woman to avoid personal responsibility,\ncontributing to a decline in moral values.[64] Abortion was often a solution\nfor women who already had children and did not want more. Consequently, the\nsize of families decreased drastically.[65]\n\n#### Poverty among working-class\nwomen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: Poverty among working-class women\")]\n\nThe [1834 Poor Law](/wiki/1834_Poor_Law \"1834 Poor Law\") defined who could\nreceive monetary relief. The act reflected and perpetuated prevailing gender\nconditions. In Edwardian society, men were the source of wealth. The law\nrestricted relief for unemployed, able-bodied male workers, due to the\nprevailing view that they would find work in the absence of financial\nassistance. However, women were treated differently. After the Poor Law was\npassed, women and children received most of the aid. The law did not recognise\nsingle independent women, and lumped women and children into the same\ncategory. If a man was physically disabled, his wife was also treated as\ndisabled under the law. Unmarried mothers were sent to the workhouse,\nreceiving unfair social treatment such as being restricted from attending\nchurch on Sundays. During marriage disputes women often lost the rights to\ntheir children, even if their husbands were abusive.[66]\n\nAt the time, single mothers were the poorest sector in society, disadvantaged\nfor at least four reasons. First, women had longer lifespans, often leaving\nthem widowed with children. Second, women's work opportunities were few, and\nwhen they did find work, their wages were lower than male workers' wages.\nThirdly, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed,\nleaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members. Finally,\npoor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received\ndisproportionately large shares of food. Many women were malnourished and had\nlimited access to health care.[66]\n\n#### Female\nservants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Female servants\")]\n\nEdwardian Britain had large numbers of male and female [domestic\nservants](/wiki/Domestic_servant \"Domestic servant\"), in both urban and rural\nareas.[67] Middle and upper-class women relied on servants to run their homes\nsmoothly. Servants were provided with food, clothing, housing, and a small\nwage, and lived in a self-enclosed social system inside the mansion.[68] The\nnumber of domestic servants fell in the Edwardian era due to a declining\nnumber of young people willing to be employed in this area.[69]\n\n### Fashion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Fashion\")]\n\nMain article: [1900s in fashion](/wiki/1900s_in_fashion \"1900s in fashion\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Women_dress-1901-1911-Punch.jpg/300px-\nWomen_dress-1901-1911-Punch.jpg)](/wiki/File:Women_dress-1901-1911-Punch.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Women_dress-1901-1911-Punch.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\ncartoon in _Punch_ (1911) compares changes in fashion between 1901 and 1911.\n\"The dowdy voluminous clothes of the earlier date, making the grandmother an\nold lady and the mother seem plain, had been replaced by much simpler looser\nwear producing a sense of release for all three females.\"[70]\n\nThe upper-classes embraced leisure sports, which resulted in rapid\ndevelopments in fashion, as more mobile and flexible clothing styles were\nneeded.[71][72] During the Edwardian era, women wore a very tight\n[corset](/wiki/Corset \"Corset\"), or [bodice](/wiki/Bodice \"Bodice\"), and\ndressed in long skirts. The Edwardian era was the last time women wore corsets\nin everyday life. According to [Arthur Marwick](/wiki/Arthur_Marwick \"Arthur\nMarwick\"), the most striking change of all the developments that occurred\nduring the Great War was the modification in women's dress, \"for, however far\npoliticians were to put the clocks back in other steeples in the years after\nthe war, no one ever put the lost inches back on the hems of women's\nskirts\".[73]\n\nThe Edwardians developed new styles in clothing design.[74] While the\nVictorian Era is associated with large, ankle-length, heavy, dark velvet gowns\nand bustles for the classes that could afford them, the Edwardian era favored\nmore tightly fitting skirts and dresses made of lightweight fabrics designed\nfor a more active lifestyle.[75]\n\n  * The 2 pieces dress came into vogue. Skirts hung tight at the hips and flared at the hem, creating a trumpet of lily-like shape.\n  * Skirts in 1901 had decorated hems with ruffles of fabric and lace.\n  * Some dresses and skirts featured trains.\n  * Tailored jackets, first introduced in 1880, increased in popularity and by 1900, tailored suits became popular.[76]\n  * By 1904, skirts became fuller and less clingy.\n  * In 1905, skirts fell in soft folds that curved in, then flared out near the hemlines.\n  * From 1905 – 1907, waistlines rose.\n  * In 1901, the [hobble skirt](/wiki/Hobble_skirt \"Hobble skirt\") was introduced; a tight fitting skirt that restricted a woman's stride.\n  * [Lingerie dresses](/wiki/Lingerie_dress \"Lingerie dress\"), or tea gowns made of soft fabrics, festooned with ruffles and lace were worn indoors.[77]\n  * Around 1913 women's dresses acquired a lower and sometimes V-shaped neckline in opposition to the high collars a generation before. This was considered a scandal and caused an outrage among the clergy throughout Europe.[78]\n\n### Newspapers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Edwardian_era&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Newspapers\")]\n\nThe turn of the century saw the rise of popular journalism aimed at the lower\nmiddle class and tending to deemphasise highly detailed political and\ninternational news, which remain the focus of a handful of low-circulation\nprestige newspapers. They were family-owned and operated, and were primarily\ninterested not in profits but in influence on the nation's elite by their\ncontrol of the news and editorials on serious topics. The new press they\nreached vastly larger audiences by emphasis on sports, crime, sensationalism,\nand gossip about famous personalities. Detailed accounts of major speeches and\ncomplex international events were not printed. [Alfred Harmsworth, 1st\nViscount Northcliffe](/wiki/Alfred_Harmsworth,_1st_Viscount_Northcliffe\n\"Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe\") was the chief innovator.[79].\nHe used his _[Daily Mail](/wiki/Daily_Mail \"Daily Mail\")_ and _[Daily\nMirror](/wiki/Daily_Mirror \"Daily Mirror\")_ to transform the media along the\nAmerican model of \"[Yellow Journalism](/wiki/Yellow_Journalism \"Yellow\nJournalism\")\".
