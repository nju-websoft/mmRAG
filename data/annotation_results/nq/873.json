The first episode aired on January 18, 2015 on [Disney\nChannel](/wiki/Disney_Channel \"Disney Channel\") as a special preview, becoming\nthe most-watched animated series debut in Disney XD’s history; the first\nseason subsequently officially premiered on Disney XD on March 30, 2015.[4][1]\nThe third season started on July 15, 2017 and concluded on April 7, 2018.[5]\nOn February 28, 2017, the series was officially renewed for a fourth\nseason.[6] Nearly a year after the renewal, it was announced that the show\nwould be moving to Disney Channel for its fourth season.[7]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Background and production\n  * 3 Promotion and release\n    * 3.1 International\n  * 4 Episodes\n  * 5 Reception\n    * 5.1 Awards and nominations\n  * 6 Other media\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n##\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil_characters \"List of Star\nvs. the Forces of Evil characters\")\n\nStar Butterfly is a [magical princess](/wiki/Magical_girl \"Magical girl\") from\nthe dimension of Mewni, and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly\nKingdom. As per tradition, she is given the family heirloom wand on her 14th\nbirthday. After she accidentally sets fire to the family castle, her parents\nKing and Queen Butterfly decide that a safer option is to send her to Earth as\na [foreign exchange student](/wiki/Foreign_exchange_student \"Foreign exchange\nstudent\"), so she can continue her magic training there. She befriends Marco\nDiaz and lives with his family while attending Echo Creek Academy. Going in a\nseries of misadventures using \"dimensional scissors\" that can open\n[portals](/wiki/Portals_in_fiction \"Portals in fiction\"), Star and Marco must\ndeal with everyday school life while protecting Star's wand from falling into\nthe hands of Ludo, a villain from Mewni who commands a group of monsters.\nBesides also dealing with her ex-boyfriend Tom, in Season 3, Star goes up\nagainst more serious villains like Toffee and Miss Heinous while uncovering\nthe mystery behind her relative Eclipsa Butterfly.\n\n## Background and\nproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Background and production\")]\n\nNefcy said she originally created Star as a girl who wanted to be a [magical\ngirl](/wiki/Magical_girl \"Magical girl\") like _[Sailor\nMoon](/wiki/Sailor_Moon_\\(character\\) \"Sailor Moon \\(character\\)\")_ , and\nMarco as a boy who was obsessed with _[Dragon Ball Z](/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z\n\"Dragon Ball Z\")_ and karate; they would be enemies instead of friends. In\nthis earlier version, Star did not have any actual magical powers; she instead\nwould approach and solve problems primarily through the force of her\ndetermination alone.[8][9] Nefcy began pitching the show when she was in her\nthird year of college, when Cartoon Network was actively soliciting the\ncreation of pilots for prospective new shows.[10] Nefcy originally placed Star\nin the fourth grade, reflecting on a time in her own childhood when she held a\nself-described obsession with the animated series _[Sailor\nMoon](/wiki/Sailor_Moon_\\(anime\\) \"Sailor Moon \\(anime\\)\")_. However, Nefcy\nlater adjusted the character's age to fourteen during the time she made her\nseries proposition to Disney.[10][8][11] An executive at that time made the\nsuggestion for Star to have actual magical powers. Nefcy worked this concept\ninto the show's current iteration, along with the idea of different dimensions\nas show locations, the framing device of Star being a foreign exchange\nstudent, and the plot aspects relating to Star being a princess and the\nsubsequent consequences of her royal birthright.[9] Nefcy said that the\noverall concept has evolved over about six years.[11]\n\nIn addition to _[Sailor Moon](/wiki/Sailor_Moon_\\(anime\\) \"Sailor Moon\n\\(anime\\)\")_ and _[Dragon Ball Z](/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z \"Dragon Ball Z\")_ ,\nNefcy has said that she had heavy influence in her youth from the animated\nJapanese shows _[Magic Knight Rayearth](/wiki/Magic_Knight_Rayearth \"Magic\nKnight Rayearth\")_ , _[Revolutionary Girl\nUtena](/wiki/Revolutionary_Girl_Utena \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\")_ and\n_[Unico](/wiki/Unico \"Unico\")_ , the last of which featured a pink unicorn.\nShe also cited shows unrelated to Japanese animation such as _[Buffy the\nVampire Slayer](/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\")_\n,[9] and was influenced by independent comic series such as _[Scott\nPilgrim](/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim \"Scott Pilgrim\")_ and _The Dungeon_.[11] With\nregards to the development of more strong female characters, Nefcy said that\nshe \"looked at TV over the years and I have had to go to Japan when I was\nyounger to find the cartoons that had the characters that I wanted to see. It\nwas always a question of 'Well, why isn't that on TV in the U.S.?'\"[8]\n\nOne of the concepts she likes about the show is that it doesn't make high\nschool the most important experience for teenagers. She also likes that Star\ndoes her own thing instead of being concerned about fitting in.[9] Nefcy did\nnot want the gimmick about keeping the magic powers a secret from others as\ntypical of magical girl shows, so she had the students already know about it\nand Marco's parents as well. She also portrays Star as not really a superhero\nas she does not specifically go after super-villains except when they attack\nher, and that she doesn't really save people.[10] Nefcy said that the episodes\nbalance comedy and drama: \"we really want our characters to feel like\nteenagers and have them going through the normal emotions that teenagers go\nthrough, but in this magical setting.\"[8]\n\nStoryboarding and design are done in Los Angeles.[11] In describing the\nprocess, Nefcy said that the show is storyboard-driven, with each episode\nmapped out by the storyboard artists. The storyboarders also do the writing,\ntaking a two-page outline and turning it into a full script. A storyboard for\n11 minutes would require about 2000 drawings to be done in a six-week\nperiod.[12] After pre-production in the US, the first season animation was\ndone at [Mercury Filmworks](/wiki/Mercury_Filmworks \"Mercury Filmworks\") in\nOttawa, Canada. Mercury had also done _[Wander Over\nYonder](/wiki/Wander_Over_Yonder \"Wander Over Yonder\")_ and the _[Mickey\nMouse](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_\\(TV_series\\) \"Mickey Mouse \\(TV series\\)\")_\nseries.[11] For the rest of first season, the animation was done in the\nPhilippines.[12] The second season was animated by Sugarcube and [Rough Draft\nStudios](/wiki/Rough_Draft_Studios \"Rough Draft Studios\"), both located in\nSouth Korea.[13][14]\n\nThe theme song was done by Brad Breeck, who also did _[Gravity\nFalls](/wiki/Gravity_Falls \"Gravity Falls\")_ ' opening theme; Nefcy said:\n\"when we were listening to it we didn't know, because we just listened\n[blind](/wiki/Blind_experiment \"Blind experiment\")\". Brian Kim was chosen\namong a group of about ten people as the show's composer.[10][15] Kim\ndescribes the music for each dimension as having a different sound and\nrelating it to indie rock in Los Angeles.[16]\n\nThe show was initially scheduled to premiere on [Disney\nChannel](/wiki/Disney_Channel \"Disney Channel\") after being greenlighted in\nMarch 2013, for a premiere in the Fall of 2014, before being switched over to\nDisney XD.[10][17] However, on February 23, 2018, it was announced that the\nshow would be moving to Disney Channel for its fourth season.[7]\n\n## Promotion and\nrelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Promotion and release\")]\n\nThe show's title sequence was promoted at [Comic-Con\n2014](/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International \"San Diego Comic-Con\nInternational\") six months prior to its scheduled broadcast premiere. As a\nresult, the footage was uploaded by fans to YouTube who then started\ngenerating fan art and fan fiction.[11] The first episode premiered on Disney\nChannel in January 2015. The positive reaction on social media prompted Disney\nXD to order a second season of the series in February 2015, six weeks ahead of\nits launch of the series on Disney XD in March.[18] Disney sitcom actors\n[Olivia Holt](/wiki/Olivia_Holt \"Olivia Holt\") and [Kelli\nBerglund](/wiki/Kelli_Berglund \"Kelli Berglund\") participated in promoting the\nseries the weeks before its Disney XD premiere, with Holt dressing up as\nStar.[19][20]\n\nThe second season premiered on July 11, 2016,[21] The show's third season was\nordered ahead in March 2016.[22] It premiered on July 15, 2017 with a two-hour\nlong television movie entitled \"The Battle for Mewni\" and consisted of the\nfirst four episodes.[23][24] A live chat featuring Star and Marco was aired on\nDisney XD on July 17.[25] The remaining third-season episodes starting airing\non November 6, 2017.[26][27] A fourth season was also ordered ahead of the\nthird season premiere.[6]\n\n###\nInternational[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: International\")]\n\n_Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ premiered in Canada on [the DHX-owned Disney\nXD](/wiki/Family_Chrgd \"Family Chrgd\") on April 6, 2015,[28] and was later\nmoved to [the Corus-owned Disney XD](/wiki/Disney_XD_\\(Canada\\) \"Disney XD\n\\(Canada\\)\") on December 1.[29] The series premiered on Disney XD channels in\nthe [United Kingdom and Ireland](/wiki/Disney_XD_\\(UK_and_Ireland\\) \"Disney XD\n\\(UK and Ireland\\)\") on April 16, 2015,[30][_[better source\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS \"Wikipedia:NOTRS\")_] in\n[Australia](/wiki/Disney_XD_\\(Australia\\) \"Disney XD \\(Australia\\)\") on August\n3,[31] and in the [Middle East and Africa](/wiki/Disney_XD_\\(Africa\\) \"Disney\nXD \\(Africa\\)\") on October 5.[32] It also premiered on November 8 on [Disney\nChannel](/wiki/Disney_Channel_\\(Asia\\) \"Disney Channel \\(Asia\\)\") in Southeast\nAsia.[33][34] The series premiered on March 6, 2016, as _Star Butterfly_ in\nFrench on [Disney La Chaîne](/wiki/Disney_La_Cha%C3%AEne \"Disney La Chaîne\")\nin Canada.[35] The show premiered on November 2 on [Disney\nXD](/wiki/Disney_XD_\\(Italy\\) \"Disney XD \\(Italy\\)\") in Italy, and on [Disney\nChannel](/wiki/Disney_Channel_\\(Italy\\) \"Disney Channel \\(Italy\\)\") on\nNovember 2, 2016.[36]\n\n##\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil\nepisodes](/wiki/List_of_Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil_episodes \"List of Star vs.\nthe Forces of Evil episodes\")\n\nSeason| Segments| Episodes| Originally aired  \n---|---|---|---  \nFirst aired| Last aired  \n| [1](/wiki/List_of_Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil_episodes#Season_1_\\(2015\\)\n\"List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil episodes\")| 24| 13| January 18, 2015\n(2015-01-18)| September 21, 2015 (2015-09-21)  \n| [2](/wiki/List_of_Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil_episodes#Season_2_\\(2016–17\\)\n\"List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil episodes\")| 41| 22| July 11, 2016\n(2016-07-11)| February 27, 2017 (2017-02-27)  \n| [3](/wiki/List_of_Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil_episodes#Season_3_\\(2017–18\\)\n\"List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil episodes\")| 38| 21| July 15, 2017\n(2017-07-15)| April 7, 2018 (2018-04-07)  \n  \n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\n_Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ has received positive reviews by critics.\n\nKevin Johnson of _[The A.V. Club](/wiki/The_A.V._Club \"The A.V. Club\")_ gave\nthe pilot episode a B+, saying that the show was something children could have\na lot of fun with, noting how the show follows current trends in western\nanimation \"towards large-eyed characters and quirky visual trends\". Johnson\nstated that _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ \"excels on wild, silly, and clever\nset-pieces to bring the laughs and action\", but expected that adult viewers\nwon't get much out of it.[37] Furthermore, the premiere of _Star vs. the\nForces of Evil_ became the most-watched animated series debut in Disney XD’s\nhistory.[4] Following the end of the second season, Disney XD announced it had\nordered a fourth season of the show, and that in 2016, _Star_ and another\nanimated show _[Milo Murphy's Law](/wiki/Milo_Murphy%27s_Law \"Milo Murphy's\nLaw\")_ had reached over 100 million consumer views combined across its media\nplatforms.[6]\n\nIn reviewing episodes from the first season, Marcy Cook of _[The Mary\nSue](/wiki/The_Mary_Sue \"The Mary Sue\")_ described the show as a blend of\nothers such as _[Invader Zim](/wiki/Invader_Zim \"Invader Zim\")_ and a\nsanitized _[Ren& Stimpy](/wiki/Ren_%26_Stimpy \"Ren & Stimpy\")_, with great\nappeal to tween and teen girls as well some laugh out loud moments for adults.\nShe said, \"[I]t's really cool to see a girl who is into cuteness and rainbows\nalso kick-ass and enjoy it\". Cook was bothered by the short episodes that made\nthe plot seem rushed or underdeveloped. Cook was bugged by Marco's\n[retconned](/wiki/Retcon \"Retcon\") personality from the pilot episode where he\nwas a safety conscious kid to the series where he was a martial arts fight\nseeker.[38] Caitlin Donovan of entertainment website Epicstream listed it\namong her top 10 animated series of 2015. She found the first few episodes to\nbe \"a little rough for me, like the show was trying too hard to be funny and\nweird\", but that the show got better with character development and\nrelationship building, with \"a really dramatic, high-tension finale to the\nfirst season\".[39]\n\n### Awards and\nnominations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Awards and nominations\")]\n\nThe episode \"Party with a Pony\" was showcased in the [Annecy International\nAnimated Film Festival](/wiki/Annecy_International_Animated_Film_Festival\n\"Annecy International Animated Film Festival\") in June 2015.[40][41]\n\nYear  | Award  | Category  | Nominee  | Result  | Ref   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n2015  | Annecy International Animated Film Festival  | TV Series  | For \"Party with a Pony\" | Nominated  | [41]  \n2016  | Annie Awards  | Best Animated TV/Broadcast Production for Children's Audience  | For \"Blood Moon Ball\" | Nominated  | [42]  \n  \n## Other\nmedia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_vs._the_Forces_of_Evil&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Other media\")]\n\nA comic book series titled _Deep Trouble_ was written by storyboarder Zach\nMarcus and illustrated by character designer Devin Taylor, both of whom are\npart of the _Star_ crew.
