Soon after the\nRevolution, the motto was sometimes written as \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\nor Death\". The \"death\" part was later dropped for being too strongly\nassociated with the [Reign of Terror](/wiki/Reign_of_Terror \"Reign of\nTerror\").\n\nThe first to express this motto was [Maximilien\nRobespierre](/wiki/Maximilien_Robespierre \"Maximilien Robespierre\") in his\nspeech _\" On the organization of the National Guard\"_\n([French](/wiki/French_language \"French language\"): _Discours sur l\n'organisation des gardes nationales_) on 5 December 1790, article XVI, and\ndisseminated widely throughout France by the popular Societies.\n\n> **Discours sur l 'organisation des gardes nationales**  \n> Article XVI.  \n> On their uniforms engraved these words: FRENCH PEOPLE, & below: LIBERTY,\n> EQUALITY, FRATERNITY.

In 1839, the philosopher\n[Pierre Leroux](/wiki/Pierre_Leroux \"Pierre Leroux\") claimed it had been an\nanonymous and popular creation.[2][_[page\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] The\nhistorian Mona Ozouf underlines that, although _Liberté_ and _Égalité_ were\nassociated as a motto during the 18th century, _Fraternité_ wasn't always\nincluded in it, and other terms, such as _Amitié_ (Friendship), _Charité_\n(Charity) or _Union_ were often added in its place.[2]\n\nThe emphasis on _Fraternité_ during the French Revolution led [Olympe de\nGouges](/wiki/Olympe_de_Gouges \"Olympe de Gouges\"), a female journalist, to\nwrite the [Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female\nCitizen](/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Woman_and_the_Female_Citizen\n\"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen\")[8][_[page\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] as a\nresponse. The tripartite motto was neither a creative collection, nor really\ninstitutionalized by the French Revolution.[2] As soon as 1789, other terms\nwere used, such as \"_la Nation, la Loi, le Roi_ \" (The Nation, The Law, The\nKing), or \"_Union, Force, Vertu_ \" (Union, Strength, Virtue), a slogan used\nbeforehand by [masonic lodges](/wiki/Freemasonry \"Freemasonry\"), or \"_Force,\nÉgalité, Justice_ \" (Strength, Equality, Justice), \"_Liberté, Sûreté,\nPropriété_ \" (Liberty, Security, Property), etc.[2]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Enseigne_Alsacienne_revolutionnaire.jpg/170px-\nEnseigne_Alsacienne_revolutionnaire.jpg)](/wiki/File:Enseigne_Alsacienne_revolutionnaire.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Enseigne_Alsacienne_revolutionnaire.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAlsatian sign, 1792:  \n_Freiheit Gleichheit Brüderlichk. od. Tod_ (Liberty Equality Fraternity or\nDeath)  \n_Tod den Tyranen_ (Death to Tyrants)  \n_Heil den Völkern_ (Long live the Peoples)\n\nIn other words, _liberté, égalité, fraternité_ was only one slogan among many\nothers.[2] During the [Jacobin](/wiki/Jacobin_Club \"Jacobin Club\")\nrevolutionary period itself, various mottos were used, such as _liberté,\nunité, égalité_ (liberty, unity, equality); _liberté, égalité, justice_\n(liberty, equality, justice); _liberté, raison, égalité_ (liberty, reason,\nequality), etc.[2] The only solid association was that of _liberté_ and\n_égalité_ , _fraternité_ being ignored by the _[Cahiers de\ndoléances](/wiki/Cahiers_de_dol%C3%A9ances \"Cahiers de doléances\")_ as well as\nby the 1789 [Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the\nCitizen](/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen\n\"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\"). It was only alluded to\nin the 1791 [Constitution](/wiki/French_Constitution \"French Constitution\"),\nas well as in [Robespierre](/wiki/Robespierre \"Robespierre\")'s draft\nDeclaration of 1793, placed under the invocation of (in that order) _égalité,\nliberté, sûreté_ and _propriété_ (equality, liberty, safety, property — though\nit was used not as a motto, but as articles of declaration), as the\npossibility of a universal extension of the Declaration of Rights: \"Men of all\ncountries are brothers, he who oppresses one nation declares himself the enemy\nof all.\"[2][a] Finally, it did not figure in the August 1793 Declaration.[2]\n\nThe [Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the\nCitizen](/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen\n\"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\") of 1789 defined liberty\nin Article 4 as follows:\n\n> Liberty consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others:\n> thus, the exercise of the natural rights of every man or woman has no bounds\n> other than those that guarantee other members of society the enjoyment of\n> these same rights.\n\nEquality, on the other hand, was defined by the 1789 Declaration in terms of\njudicial equality and merit-based entry to government (art. 6):\n\n> [The law] \"must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All\n> citizens, being equal in its eyes, shall be equally eligible to all high\n> offices, public positions and employments, according to their ability, and\n> without other distinction than that of their virtues and talents.\"\n\n_Liberté, égalité, fraternité_ actually finds its origins in a May 1791\nproposition by the _[Club des Cordeliers](/wiki/Cordeliers \"Cordeliers\")_ ,\nfollowing a speech on the Army by the [marquis de\nGuichardin](/w/index.php?title=Marquis_de_Guichardin&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Marquis de Guichardin \\(page does not exist\\)\").[2] A British marine held\nprisoner on the French ship _Le Marat_ in 1794 wrote home in letters published\nin 1796:[9]\n\n> The republican spirit is inculcated not in songs only, for in every part of\n> the ship I find emblems purposely displayed to awaken it. All the orders\n> relating to the discipline of the crew are hung up, and prefaced by the\n> words _Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, ou la Mort_ , written in capital\n> letters.\n\nThe compatibility of _liberté_ and _égalité_ was not doubted in the first days\nof the Revolution, and the problem of the antecedence of one term on the other\nnot lifted.[2] Thus, the [Abbé Sieyès](/wiki/Abb%C3%A9_Siey%C3%A8s \"Abbé\nSieyès\") considered that only liberty ensured equality, unless the latter was\nto be the equality of all dominated by a [despot](/wiki/Despotism\n\"Despotism\"); while liberty followed equality ensured by the rule of law.[2]\nThe abstract generality of law (theorized by [Jean-Jacques\nRousseau](/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau \"Jean-Jacques Rousseau\") in _[The Social\nContract](/wiki/The_Social_Contract \"The Social Contract\")_) thus ensured the\nidentification of liberty to equality, liberty being negatively defined as an\nindependence from arbitrary rule, and equality considered abstractly in its\njudicial form.[2]\n\nThis identification of liberty and equality became problematic during the\nJacobin period, when equality was redefined (for instance by [François-Noël\nBabeuf](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-No%C3%ABl_Babeuf \"François-Noël Babeuf\")) as\n[equality of results](/wiki/Equality_of_outcome \"Equality of outcome\"), and\nnot only judicial equality of rights.[2] Thus, [Marc Antoine\nBaudot](/wiki/Marc_Antoine_Baudot \"Marc Antoine Baudot\") considered that\nFrench temperament inclined rather to equality than liberty, a theme which\nwould be re-used by [Pierre Louis Roederer](/wiki/Pierre_Louis_Roederer\n\"Pierre Louis Roederer\") and [Alexis de\nTocqueville](/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville \"Alexis de Tocqueville\"), while\n[Jacques Necker](/wiki/Jacques_Necker \"Jacques Necker\") considered that an\nequal society could only be found on coercion.[2]\n\nThe third term, _fraternité_ , was the most problematic to insert in the\ntriad, as it belonged to another sphere, that of moral obligations rather than\nrights, links rather than statutes, harmony rather than\n[contract](/wiki/Freedom_of_contract \"Freedom of contract\"), and community\nrather than individuality.[2] Various interpretations of _fraternité_ existed.\nThe first one, according to Mona Ozouf, was one of \"_fraternité de rébellion_\n\" (Fraternity of Rebellion),[2] that is the union of the deputies in the _[Jeu\nde Paume Oath](/wiki/Tennis_Court_Oath \"Tennis Court Oath\")_ of June 1789,\nrefusing the dissolution ordered by the King [Louis XVI](/wiki/Louis_XVI\n\"Louis XVI\"): \"We swear never to separate ourselves from the [National\nAssembly](/wiki/National_Assembly_\\(French_Revolution\\) \"National Assembly\n\\(French Revolution\\)\"), and to reassemble wherever circumstances require,\nuntil the constitution of the realm is drawn up and fixed upon solid\nfoundations.\" Fraternity was thus issued from Liberty and oriented by a common\ncause.[2]\n\nAnother form of _fraternité_ was that of the patriotic Church, which\nidentified social link with religious link and based fraternity on Christian\nbrotherhood.[2] In this second sense, _fraternité_ preceded both _liberté_ and\n_égalité_ , instead of following them as in the first sense.[2][_[page\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] Thus, two\nsenses of Fraternity: \"one, that followed liberty and equality, was the object\nof a free pact; the other preceded liberty and equality as the mark on its\nwork of the divine craftsman.\"[2]\n\nAnother hesitation concerning the compatibility of the three terms arose from\nthe opposition between liberty and equality as\n[individualistic](/wiki/Individualism \"Individualism\") values, and fraternity\nas the realization of a happy community, devoided of any conflicts and opposed\nto any form of [egotism](/wiki/Egotism \"Egotism\").[2] This fusional\ninterpretation of Fraternity opposed it to the project of [individual\nautonomy](/wiki/Self-ownership \"Self-ownership\") and manifested the precedence\nof Fraternity on individual will.[2]\n\nIn this sense, it was sometimes associated with death, as in _Fraternité, ou\nla Mort!_ (Fraternity or Death!), excluding liberty and even equality, by\nestablishing a strong dichotomy between those who were brothers and those who\nwere not (in the sense of \"[you are with me or against\nme](/wiki/You%27re_either_with_us,_or_against_us \"You're either with us, or\nagainst us\")\", brother or foe).[2][_[page\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] [Louis de\nSaint-Just](/wiki/Louis_de_Saint-Just \"Louis de Saint-Just\") thus stigmatized\n[Anarchasis Cloots](/wiki/Anarchasis_Cloots \"Anarchasis Cloots\")'\n[cosmopolitanism](/wiki/Cosmopolitanism \"Cosmopolitanism\"), declaring \"Cloots\nliked the universe, except France.\"[2]\n\nWith [Thermidor](/wiki/Thermidorian_Reaction \"Thermidorian Reaction\") and the\nexecution of Robespierre, _fraternité_ disappeared from the slogan, reduced to\nthe two terms of liberty and equality, re-defined again as simple judicial\nequality and not as the equality upheld by the sentiment of fraternity.[2] The\n[First Consul](/wiki/First_Consul \"First Consul\") ([Napoleon\nBonaparte](/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte \"Napoleon Bonaparte\")) then established\nthe motto _liberté, ordre public_ (liberty, public order).\n\n## 19th\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: 19th century\")]\n\nFollowing Napoleon's rule, the triptych dissolved itself, as none believed\npossible to conciliate individual liberty and equality of rights with\n[equality of results](/wiki/Equality_of_outcome \"Equality of outcome\") and\nfraternity.[2] The idea of [individual sovereignty](/wiki/Self-ownership\n\"Self-ownership\") and of [natural rights](/wiki/Natural_rights \"Natural\nrights\") possessed by man before being united in the collectivity contradicted\nthe possibility of establishing a transparent and fraternal community.[2]\n[Liberals](/wiki/Liberalism \"Liberalism\") accepted liberty and equality,\ndefining the latter as equality of rights and ignoring fraternity.[2]\n\n[Early Socialists](/wiki/Utopian_Socialism \"Utopian Socialism\") rejected an\nindependent conception of liberty, opposed to the social, and also despised\nequality, as they considered, as [Fourier](/wiki/Charles_Fourier \"Charles\nFourier\"), that one had only to orchestrate individual discordances, to\nharmonize them, or they believed, as [Saint-\nSimon](/wiki/Claude_Henri_de_Rouvroy,_comte_de_Saint-Simon \"Claude Henri de\nRouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon\"), that equality contradicted\n[equity](/wiki/Equity_\\(economics\\) \"Equity \\(economics\\)\") by a brutal\nlevelling of individualities.[2] Utopian Socialism thus only cared about\nFraternity, which was, in [Cabet](/wiki/Etienne_Cabet \"Etienne Cabet\")'s\n[Icarie](/wiki/Icarians \"Icarians\") the sole commandment.[2]\n\nThis opposition between liberals and socialists was mirrored in rival\nhistorical interpretations of the Revolution, liberals admiring 1789, and\nSocialists 1793.[2] The [July Revolution](/wiki/July_Revolution \"July\nRevolution\") of 1830, establishing a constitutional monarchy headed by [Louis-\nPhilippe](/wiki/Louis-Philippe_of_France \"Louis-Philippe of France\"),\nsubstituted _ordre et liberté_ (order and liberty) to the Napoleonic motto\n_Liberté, Ordre public_.[2] Despite this apparent disappearance of the\ntriptych, the latter was still being thought in some underground circles, in\nRepublican [secret societies](/wiki/Secret_societies \"Secret societies\"),\nmasonic lodges such as the \"Indivisible Trinity,\" far-left booklets or during\nthe [Canuts Revolt](/wiki/Canuts_Revolt \"Canuts Revolt\") in Lyon.[2] In 1834,\nthe lawyer of the [Society of the Rights of\nMan](/wiki/Society_of_the_Rights_of_Man \"Society of the Rights of Man\")\n(Société des droits de l'homme), [Dupont](/wiki/Jacques-\nCharles_Dupont_de_l%27Eure \"Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure\"), a liberal\nsitting in the far-left during the [July Monarchy](/wiki/July_Monarchy \"July\nMonarchy\"), associated the three terms together in the _[Revue\nRépublicaine](/w/index.php?title=Revue_R%C3%A9publicaine&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Revue Républicaine \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ which he edited:\n\n> Any man aspires to liberty, to equality, but he can not achieve it without\n> the assistance of other men, without fraternity[2][b]\n\nThe triptych resurfaced during the 1847 _[Campagne des\nBanquets](/wiki/Campagne_des_Banquets \"Campagne des Banquets\")_ , upheld for\nexample in [Lille](/wiki/Lille \"Lille\") by [Ledru-Rollin](/wiki/Ledru-Rollin\n\"Ledru-Rollin\").[2]\n\nTwo interpretations had attempted to conciliate the three terms, beyond the\nantagonism between liberals and socialists. One was upheld by Catholic\ntraditionalists, such as [Chateaubriand](/wiki/Chateaubriand \"Chateaubriand\")\nor [Ballanche](/wiki/Ballanche \"Ballanche\"), the other by socialist and\nrepublicans such as [Pierre Leroux](/wiki/Pierre_Leroux \"Pierre Leroux\").[2]\nChateaubriand thus gave a Christian interpretation of the revolutionary motto,\nstating in the 1841 conclusion to his _Mémoires d 'outre-tombe_:\n\n> Far from being at its term, the religion of the Liberator is now only just\n> entering its third phase, the political period, liberty, equality,\n> fraternity[2][c]\n\nNeither Chateaubriand nor Ballanche considered the three terms to be\nantagonistic. Rather, they took them for being the achievement of\nChristianity. On the other hand, Pierre Leroux did not disguise the\ndifficulties of associating the three terms, but superated it by considering\nliberty as the aim, equality as the principle and fraternity as the means.[2]\nLeroux thus ordered the motto as Liberty, Fraternity, Equality,[2] an order\nalso supported by [Christian socialists](/wiki/Christian_socialism \"Christian\nsocialism\"), such as [Buchez](/wiki/Buchez \"Buchez\").[2]\n\nAgainst this new order of the triptych, [Michelet](/wiki/Jules_Michelet \"Jules\nMichelet\") supported the traditional order, maintaining the primordial\nimportance of an original individualistic right.[2] Michelet attempted to\nconciliate a rational communication with a fraternal communication, \"right\nbeyond right\",[2][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] and thus the rival traditions of Socialism and\nLiberalism.[2] The [Republican](/wiki/Republicanism \"Republicanism\") tradition\nwould strongly inspire itself from Michelet's synchretism.[2]\n\n### 1848\nRevolution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1848 Revolution\")]\n\n_Liberté, égalité, fraternité_ on French coins\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/France_5_francs_1849.jpg/200px-\nFrance_5_francs_1849.jpg)](/wiki/File:France_5_francs_1849.jpg)\n\n5-franc piece, 1849\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/France_20_francs_1851.jpg/200px-\nFrance_20_francs_1851.jpg)](/wiki/File:France_20_francs_1851.jpg)\n\n20-franc piece, 1851\n\nWith the [1848 February Revolution](/wiki/1848_February_Revolution \"1848\nFebruary Revolution\"), the motto was officially adopted,[10] mainly under the\npressure of the people who had attempted to impose the [red\nflag](/wiki/Red_flag_\\(politics\\) \"Red flag \\(politics\\)\") over the [tricolor\nflag](/wiki/Flag_of_France \"Flag of France\") (the 1791 red flag was, however,\nthe symbol of martial law and of order, not of insurrection).[2]\n[Lamartine](/wiki/Lamartine \"Lamartine\") opposed popular aspirations, and in\nexchange of the maintaining of the tricolor flag, conceded the Republican\nmotto of _Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité_ , written on the flag, on which a red\nrosette was also to be added.[2]\n\nFraternity was then considered to resume and to contain both Liberty and\nEquality, being a form of civil religion (which, far from opposing itself to\nChristianity, was associated with it in 1848[2][_[page\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_])\nestablishing social link (as called for by Rousseau in the conclusion of the\n_Social Contract_).[2]\n\nHowever, Fraternity was not devoid of its previous sense of opposition between\nbrothers and foes, images of blood haunting revolutionary Christian\npublications, taking in [Lamennais](/wiki/Lamennais \"Lamennais\")' themes.[2]\nThus, the newspaper _[Le Christ\nrépublicain](/w/index.php?title=Le_Christ_r%C3%A9publicain&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Le Christ républicain \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ (The Republican Christ)\ndeveloped the idea of the Christ bringing forth peace to the poor and war to\nthe rich.[2][11]\n\nAs soon as 6 January 1852, the future [Napoleon\nIII](/wiki/Napoleon_III_of_France \"Napoleon III of France\"), first President\nof the Republic, ordered all [prefects](/wiki/Prefects_of_France \"Prefects of\nFrance\") to erase the triptych from all official documents and buildings,\nconflated with insurrection and disorder.[2] [Auguste\nComte](/wiki/Auguste_Comte \"Auguste Comte\") applauded Napoleon, claiming\nequality to be the \"symbol of metaphysical anarchism\", and preferring to it\nhis diptych \"_ordre et progrès_ \" (\"order and progress\", which would then\nbecome the motto of Brazil, [Ordem e Progresso](/wiki/Ordem_e_Progresso \"Ordem\ne Progresso\")).[12] On the other hand, [Proudhon](/wiki/Proudhon \"Proudhon\")\ncriticized fraternity as an empty word, which he associated with idealistic\ndreams of [Romanticism](/wiki/Romanticism \"Romanticism\").[2] He preferred to\nit the sole term of liberty.\n\n### Paris Commune and Third\nRepublic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Paris Commune and Third Republic\")]\n\nPache, mayor of the [Paris Commune](/wiki/Paris_Commune \"Paris Commune\"),\npainted the formula \"Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, ou la mort\" on the walls of\nthe commune.

Pétain had taken this motto from the [colonel de la\nRocque](/wiki/Colonel_de_la_Rocque \"Colonel de la Rocque\")'s _[Parti social\nfrançais](/wiki/Parti_social_fran%C3%A7ais \"Parti social français\")_ (PSF),\nalthough the latter considered it more appropriate for a movement than for a\nregime.[2]\n\nFollowing the Liberation, the [Provisional Government of the French\nRepublic](/wiki/Provisional_Government_of_the_French_Republic \"Provisional\nGovernment of the French Republic\") (GPRF) re-established the Republican motto\n_Liberté, égalité, fraternité_ , which is incorporated into both the 1946 and\nthe 1958 French constitutions.[1]\n\n## Other\nnations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Other nations\")]\n\nMany other nations have adopted the French slogan of \"liberty, equality, and\nfraternity\" as an ideal. These words appear in the\n[preamble](/wiki/Preamble_to_the_Constitution_of_India \"Preamble to the\nConstitution of India\") to the [Constitution of\nIndia](/wiki/Constitution_of_India \"Constitution of India\"), enforced in 1950.\nSince its founding, \"Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood\" has been the lemma of\nthe Social Democratic Party of Denmark. In the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") the political party the\n[Liberal Democrats](/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_\\(UK\\) \"Liberal Democrats \\(UK\\)\")\nrefer to \"the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community\" in the\npreamble of the party's Federal Constitution, and this is printed on party\nmembership cards.[14]\n\nThe Philippine national flag has a rectangular design that consists of a white\nequilateral triangle, symbolizing liberty, equality, and fraternity; a\nhorizontal blue stripe for peace, truth, and justice; and a horizontal red\nstripe for patriotism and valor . In the center of the white triangle is an\neight- rayed golden sun symbolizing unity, freedom, people's democracy, and\nsovereignty.\n\nThe idea of the slogan \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" has also given an\ninfluence as [natural law](/wiki/Natural_law \"Natural law\") to the First\nArticle of the [Universal Declaration of Human\nRights](/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights \"Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights\"):\n\n> All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are\n> endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a\n> spirit of brotherhood.[15]\n\n##\nCulture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Culture\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Liberte-egalite-\nfraternite-tympanum-church-saint-pancrace-aups-var.jpg/300px-Liberte-egalite-\nfraternite-tympanum-church-saint-pancrace-aups-var.jpg)](/wiki/File:Liberte-\negalite-fraternite-tympanum-church-saint-pancrace-aups-var.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Liberte-egalite-fraternite-tympanum-church-saint-pancrace-aups-\nvar.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Tympanum](/wiki/Tympanum_\\(architecture\\) \"Tympanum \\(architecture\\)\") of a\nstate-owned [church](/wiki/Church_\\(building\\) \"Church \\(building\\)\")\n\nAt one point the motto was used to mark churches which were controlled by the\nstate, rather than the Catholic Church.\n\nSome former colonies of the French Republic (such as [Haiti](/wiki/Haiti\n\"Haiti\"), [Chad](/wiki/Chad \"Chad\"), [Niger](/wiki/Niger \"Niger\"), and\n[Gabon](/wiki/Gabon \"Gabon\")) have adopted similar three-word mottos.\n\nThe terms are also referred to in the film trilogy [Three\nColors](/wiki/Three_Colors \"Three Colors\") by [Krzysztof\nKieślowski](/wiki/Krzysztof_Kie%C5%9Blowski \"Krzysztof Kieślowski\").\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Give me liberty or give me death](/wiki/Give_me_liberty_or_give_me_death \"Give me liberty or give me death\")\n  * [Life, liberty, and property](/wiki/Life,_liberty,_and_property \"Life, liberty, and property\")\n  * [Brotherhood and unity](/wiki/Brotherhood_and_unity \"Brotherhood and unity\")\n  * [Travail, Famille, Patrie](/wiki/Travail,_Famille,_Patrie \"Travail, Famille, Patrie\")\\- the national motto of [Vichy France](/wiki/Vichy_France \"Vichy France\")\n  * Salazar's [Estado Novo](/wiki/Estado_Novo_\\(Portugal\\) \"Estado Novo \\(Portugal\\)\")'s motto _Deus, Pátria e Familia_ (meaning \"God, Fatherland, and Family\")\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** French: \"_Les hommes de tous les pays sont frères, celui qui opprime une seule nation se déclare l 'ennemi de toutes._\"\n  2. **Jump up ^** French: \"_Tout homme aspire à la liberté, à l 'égalité, mais on ne peut y atteindre sans le secours des autres hommes, sans la fraternité._\"\n  3. **Jump up ^** French: \"_Loin d 'être à son terme, la religion du Libérateur entre à peine dans sa troisième période, la période politique, liberté, égalité, fraternité._\"\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ [\"Liberty, Égalité, Fraternité\"](http://www.ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article620).
