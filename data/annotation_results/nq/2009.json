A powerful creature called\n[Godzilla](/wiki/Godzilla \"Godzilla\") appeared which destroyed humans and\nmonsters alike. Two species of aliens, the Exif and the Bilusaludo, arrived\nwith the former attempting to convert humanity to their religion and the\nlatter seeking to emigrate to Earth with promises to defeat Godzilla with\n[Mechagodzilla](/wiki/Mechagodzilla \"Mechagodzilla\"), should humanity accept\nthem. However, the Bilusaludo were unable to activate Mechagodzilla, which\nforced the aliens and humanity to abandon Earth and emigrate to [Tau Ceti\ne](/wiki/Tau_Ceti_e \"Tau Ceti e\").\n\n20 years later and 11.9 light years away, Captain Haruo Sakaki locks himself\nin a shuttle, threatening to bomb the area unless the ship leaves Planet Tau-e\nand abandons the emigration project. Haruo believes the planet is\nuninhabitable and the emigration crew only consists of the elderly, including\nhis grandfather, because he believes the ship's committee are trying to reduce\nthe population due to limited resources. Haruo fails, is arrested and thrown\nin a cell where he witnesses the emigration shuttle exploding upon leaving the\nplanet.\n\nMetphies, an Exif priest, visits Haruo, where he hands him classified data\nregarding Godzilla. Haruo anonymously publishes an essay detailing Godzilla's\nweak points, which convinces the central committee to return to Earth after\nconcluding that finding another habitable planet seems unlikely. Upon\nreturning to Earth, the ship sends recon drones to scout the Earth but reveal\nthat Godzilla is still alive after all these years.\n\nMetphies explains to the committee that they cannot co-exist with Godzilla and\nsuggests killing it. He also explains that the anonymous essay was the result\nof a thorough investigation and is sound, promising to reveal the author under\nthe condition that Haruo is released.\n\nHaruo is released on bail and explains to the committee that a certain unknown\norgan in Godzilla's body can emit a high frequency electromagnetic pulse that\ngenerates an asymmetrical permeable shield. Haruo proposes shoving an EMP\nprobe within the cracked organ before it regenerates so Godzilla can implode.\nHowever, Haruo stresses that close quarters combat would be needed for\naccurately coordinated attacks in order to find its weak organ, as well as 600\npeople.\n\nThe committee reluctantly accepts and upon landing two battalions on Earth,\ndiscovering that 20,000 years have passed and that Godzilla's presence has\nradically altered Earth's biosphere. They are attacked by a group of flying\ncreatures called Servums and Leland, the company's commander, orders a retreat\nbut Metphies stresses that they would need to rendezvous with Companies D and\nE through a pass where Godzilla frequents.\n\nHowever, once the group mobilizes, they encounter Godzilla. Haruo proceeds\nwith the original plan on his own and attacks Godzilla. Leland manages to\nprovoke Godzilla to use its atomic breath, but at the cost of his life.\nLeland's actions reveal that Godzilla's weak point is its dorsal fins. Command\nfalls to Metphies, who promotes Haruo to commander. In a speech, Haruo\nconvinces the remaining survivors to continue with the plan and defeat\nGodzilla.\n\nThe group attacks Godzilla and manage to trap it within a collapsed mountain\npass. EMP probes are drilled into Godzilla's dorsal fins which causes it to\nimplode. Martin Lazzari, the group's environmental biologist, theorizes that\nthis Godzilla may be different from the one that drove humanity away,\nbelieving it to be an offspring. Subsequently, the original Godzilla, which\nhas grown several times larger, surfaces from beneath a nearby mountain and\ndestroys the remaining crew. Trapped beneath rubble, Haruo watches Godzilla\nleave, vowing to kill it.\n\nIn a [post-credits scene](/wiki/Post-credits_scene \"Post-credits scene\"),\nHaruo wakes up in a secluded area, finding an indigenous girl next to him.\n\n## Voice\ncast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Godzilla:_Planet_of_the_Monsters&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Voice cast\")]\n\nCharacters  | Japanese[7][8] | English[4]  \n---|---|---  \nHaruo Sakaki  | [Mamoru Miyano](/wiki/Mamoru_Miyano \"Mamoru Miyano\") (adult), [Aya Suzaki](/wiki/Aya_Suzaki \"Aya Suzaki\") (young)[9] | Chris Niosi (adult), Rachelle Heger (young)   \nMetphies  | [Takahiro Sakurai](/wiki/Takahiro_Sakurai \"Takahiro Sakurai\") | [Lucien Dodge](/wiki/Lucien_Dodge \"Lucien Dodge\")  \nMartin Lazzari  | [Tomokazu Sugita](/wiki/Tomokazu_Sugita \"Tomokazu Sugita\") | Edward Bosco   \nMulu Elu Galu Gu  | [Junichi Suwabe](/wiki/Junichi_Suwabe \"Junichi Suwabe\") | [Jamieson Price](/wiki/Jamieson_Price \"Jamieson Price\")  \nRilu-Elu Belu-be  | [Kenta Miyake](/wiki/Kenta_Miyake \"Kenta Miyake\") | Rich Brown   \nYuko Tani  | [Kana Hanazawa](/wiki/Kana_Hanazawa \"Kana Hanazawa\") | [Cristina Vee](/wiki/Cristina_Vee \"Cristina Vee\")  \nAdam Bindewald  | [Yūki Kaji](/wiki/Y%C5%ABki_Kaji \"Yūki Kaji\") | [Robbie Daymond](/wiki/Robbie_Daymond \"Robbie Daymond\")  \nEliott Leland  | [Daisuke Ono](/wiki/Daisuke_Ono \"Daisuke Ono\") | [Ray Chase](/wiki/Ray_Chase_\\(voice_actor\\) \"Ray Chase \\(voice actor\\)\")  \nUnberto Mori  | [Kenyu Horiuchi](/wiki/Kenyu_Horiuchi \"Kenyu Horiuchi\") | [Keith Silverstein](/wiki/Keith_Silverstein \"Keith Silverstein\")  \nHalu-Elu Dolu-do  | [Kazuya Nakai](/wiki/Kazuya_Nakai \"Kazuya Nakai\") | [Doug Stone](/wiki/Doug_Stone_\\(voice_actor\\) \"Doug Stone \\(voice actor\\)\")  \nEndurphe  | [Kazuhiro Yamaji](/wiki/Kazuhiro_Yamaji \"Kazuhiro Yamaji\") | [Joe Ochman](/wiki/Joe_Ochman \"Joe Ochman\")  \n  \n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Godzilla:_Planet_of_the_Monsters&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nIn August 2016, [Toho](/wiki/Toho \"Toho\") announced that an animated Godzilla\nfilm was being developed, targeted for a 2017 release.
