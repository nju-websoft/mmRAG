This history is given in the table below. Unless otherwise noted, if\ndifferent alcohol categories have different minimum purchase ages, the age\nlisted below is set at the _lowest age given_ (e.g. if the purchase age is 18\nfor beer and 21 for wine or spirits, as was the case in several states, the\nage in the table will read as \"18\", not \"21\"). In addition, the _purchase age_\nis not necessarily the same as the minimum age for _consumption_ of alcoholic\nbeverages, although they have often been the same.\n\nAs one can see in the table below, there has been much volatility in the\nstates' drinking ages since the [repeal](/wiki/Repeal_of_Prohibition \"Repeal\nof Prohibition\") of [Prohibition](/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States\n\"Prohibition in the United States\") in 1933. Shortly after the ratification of\nthe [21st amendment](/wiki/Twenty-\nfirst_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-first Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution\") in December, most states set their purchase\nages at 21 since that was the [Voting age](/wiki/Voting_age \"Voting age\") at\nthe time. Most of these limits remained constant until the early 1970s. From\n1969 to 1976, some 30 states lowered their purchase ages, generally to 18.\nThis was primarily because the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1971\nwith the [26th amendment](/wiki/Twenty-\nsixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-sixth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution\"). Many states started to lower their minimum\ndrinking age in response, most of this occurring in 1972 or 1973.[1][2][3]\nTwelve states kept their purchase ages at 21 since repeal of Prohibition and\nnever changed them.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1983, several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19\n(or, less commonly, 20 or 21), in part to combat [drunk\ndriving](/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence \"Driving under the influence\")\nfatalities.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In 1984, Congress passed the [National Minimum\nDrinking Age Act](/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act_of_1984 \"National\nMinimum Drinking Age Act of 1984\"), which required states to raise their ages\nfor purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their\nfederal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia\nhad raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin\nIslands, see Additional Notes below). [South Dakota](/wiki/South_Dakota \"South\nDakota\") and [Wyoming](/wiki/Wyoming \"Wyoming\") were the final two states to\ncomply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point\nof contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of\nmajority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other\ncountries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a\ncongressional sidestep of the [tenth\namendment](/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Tenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\"). Although debates have not been\nhighly publicized, a few states have proposed legislation to lower their\ndrinking age,[4] while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010.[5]\n\nState | [Pre-Prohibition](/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\")  \n(prior to 1919) | [Post-Prohibition](/wiki/Twenty-first_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution\")  \n(after 1933) | 1970s / [26th Amendment](/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\")  \n(adopted in 1971) | 1980s /  \n[Drinking Age Act of 1984](/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act_of_1984 \"National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984\") | 21st century   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n[Alabama](/wiki/Alabama \"Alabama\") | **Pre 1881:**  \nNone  \n**1881:**  \n21 (none with consent of parent)[6] | 21 | **1975:**  \nLowered to 19[7] | **1986:**  \nRaised to 21[8] | 21 (no one underage is allowed consumption Section 28-1)   \n[Alaska](/wiki/Alaska \"Alaska\") | ? | 21[7] | **1970:**  \nLowered to 19[9] | **1984:**  \nRaised to 21 with grandfather clause (if born before January 1, 1965)[10][11] | 21   \n[Arizona](/wiki/Arizona \"Arizona\") | ? | 21[11] | **1972:**  \nLowered to 19[12][13] | **1985:**  \nRaised to 21[8] | 21   \n[Arkansas](/wiki/Arkansas \"Arkansas\") | **Pre 1925:**  \nNone[7]  \n**1925:**  \n21[7] | 21 | 21[14] | 21[8] | 21   \n[California](/wiki/California \"California\") | **Pre 1891:**  \nRegulated by municipality/county (common age was 16)[15][16][17]  \n**1891:**  \n18 (statewide)[18] | **1933:**  \n21[7] | 21 | 21[8] | 21 (except small amounts for religious ceremonies)   \n[Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\") | None[11] | **1945:**  \n18: for beer  \n21: for wine and liquor[7] | 18[19] | Raised to 21 in 1987[8] | 21   \n[Connecticut](/wiki/Connecticut \"Connecticut\") | ? | 21[11] | **1972:**  \nLowered to 18[20] | **1982:**  \nRaised to 19  \n**1983:**  \nRaised to 20  \n**1985:**  \nRaised to 21[21] | 21 (exemptions: (1) a person over age eighteen who is an employee or permit holder under section 30-90a and who possesses alcoholic liquor in the course of such person's employment or business, (2) a minor who possesses alcoholic liquor on the order of a practicing physician, or (3) a minor who possesses alcoholic liquor while accompanied by a parent, guardian or spouse of the minor, who has attained the age of twenty-one.

That is because the federal law is concerned only with purchase and public possession, not private consumption, and contains several exceptions. As of January 1, 2007, 14 states and the District of Columbia ban underage consumption outright, 19 states do not specifically ban underage consumption outright, and 17 states have family member or location exceptions to their underage consumption laws. Federal law explicitly provides for religious, medical, employment and private club possession exceptions; as of 2005, 31 states have family member or location exceptions to their underage possession laws.[41]\n  * In the 1960s the age for buying or drinking beer and wine in the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) was 18; the age for hard liquor was 21.[23][24] Residents from Virginia and Maryland would often drive to D.C. to obtain alcohol. In [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\"), the 1987 law raising the age from 18 to 21 was deliberately written solely to comply with the [National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984](/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act_of_1984 \"National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984\") to avoid losing highway funding, while still allowing 18- to 20-year-olds to drink as before. Not only did it still allow 18- to 20-year-olds to consume in private, it contained a major loophole allowing bars and stores to _sell_ alcohol to 18- to 20-year-olds without penalty (despite _purchase_ being technically illegal) which meant that the _de facto_ age was still 18.[39] In other words, the drinking age was 21 only on paper. This loophole was closed in 1995, but in 1996 the Louisiana Supreme Court declared a drinking age of 21 unconstitutional.[39] That briefly lowered the _de jure_ purchase age to 18, causing an uproar which prompted the Louisiana Supreme Court to reverse its decision, raising the age to 21 three months later.[40] Other exceptions still remain to this day, including drinking in a private residence,[41] and Louisiana still has some of the most liberal general alcohol laws of any state.\n  * Some states were \"dry\" well before national [Prohibition](/wiki/Prohibition \"Prohibition\") was enacted in 1919, in some cases since achieving statehood. Also, some states did not become fully \"wet\" until several years after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 (e.g. Mississippi in 1966). Since 1966, all states and territories of the USA have been \"wet\", but [dry counties](/wiki/Dry_counties \"Dry counties\") and towns still exist in some states.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=U.S._history_of_alcohol_minimum_purchase_age_by_state&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"NIH Fact Sheets - Underage Drinking\"](https://report.nih.gov/nihfactsheets/viewfactsheet.aspx?csid=21). _Report.nih.gov_. 2013-03-29.
