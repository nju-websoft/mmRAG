        "# Tourism in Iceland\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**Tourism in Iceland** has grown considerably in [economic\nsignificance](/wiki/Economy_of_Iceland \"Economy of Iceland\") in the past 15\nyears. As of 2016, the tourism industry is estimated to contribute about 10\npercent to the Icelandic GDP[1]; the number of foreign visitors is set to\nexceed 2,000,000 by the end of 2017; tourism is responsible for a share of\nnearly 30 percent of the country's [export\nrevenue](/wiki/Economy_of_Iceland#Exports \"Economy of Iceland\").[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Tourist Demographics\n  * 3 Popular Tourist Destinations\n  * 4 Arrivals by country\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tourism_in_Iceland&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Number_of_tourists_in_Iceland_and_population.svg/350px-\nNumber_of_tourists_in_Iceland_and_population.svg.png)](/w/index.php?title=File:Number_of_tourists_in_Iceland_and_population.svg&lang=en)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Number_of_tourists_in_Iceland_and_population.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nEvolution of the annual number of foreign visitors to Iceland, as compared to\nthe growth of the resident population.\n\nServices provided to foreign tourists were for a long time an insignificant\npart of the Icelandic economy, rarely contributing more than 2 percent to GDP,\neven long after the advent of international air travel.[3] Until the early\n1980s, the number of foreign visitors to Iceland increased slowly and\nerratically, never exceeding 80,000 in a single year,[4] and for many years\nafter that only barely kept pace with the increase in the number of Icelanders\ntraveling to and from the country. This situation lasted until the turn of the\ncentury, when the annual number of visitors exceeded the total resident\npopulation for the first time, at around 300,000.\n\nA few years later the Icelandic tourism industry started to experience a boom\nwhich to this day shows no signs of abating, as witnessed by the fact that the\nnumber of foreign visitors grew on average by 6 percent per year between 2003\nand 2010, and by some 20 percent per year on average between 2010 and\n2014.[5][6] In 2015, this rapid increase has continued, with the number of\nforeign visitors already exceeding 1 million in the period January to October.\nAccording to the Icelandic Tourist Board, the total number of overnight stays\nby foreign visitors to Iceland grew from 595,000 in 2000 to 2.1 million in\n2010, before rising to 4.4 million in 2014.[7]\n\nThe number of people working in tourism-related industries in Iceland was\n21,600 in 2014, representing nearly 12 percent of the total workforce, and\ntourism's direct contribution to GDP is now close to 5 percent.[8]\n\n## Tourist\nDemographics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tourism_in_Iceland&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Tourist Demographics\")]\n\nIceland is well known for its untouched nature and unique atmosphere.[9]\nIceland receives the highest number of tourists during summer (June–August).\nIn 2014, around 42% of visitors arrived in Iceland during its summer months,\nproportionally a slight decrease compared to the previous two years, the\npercentage of winter visitors having increased by over 4% in the same\nperiod.[10] As of year 2014, Iceland's largest tourism markets comprises\ntourists from Central/South Europe, followed by those from other regions:\nNorth America, the UK, then the Nordic countries. In terms of visitors from\nindividual countries, the top five for 2014 were the UK, USA, Germany, France\nand Norway. Canada had the largest percentage increase in visitor numbers in\nthe 2013-2014 period, with an increase of over 60% year on year. [11]\n\n## Popular Tourist\nDestinations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tourism_in_Iceland&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Popular Tourist Destinations\")]\n\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Icelandic Tourist Board in 2014, the\nfollowing 10 destinations are the ones most frequently visited in Iceland, out\nof 39 specifically mentioned in the survey (the percentages indicate the\nproportion of all foreign tourists visiting the destination in question and\nrelate to the summer season, some of the destinations being less easily\naccessible in winter).
