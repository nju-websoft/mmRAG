Collaborating with\nlyricist [Don Black](/wiki/Don_Black_\\(lyricist\\) \"Don Black \\(lyricist\\)\"),\nit was written for the song cycle show _[Tell Me on a\nSunday](/wiki/Tell_Me_on_a_Sunday \"Tell Me on a Sunday\")_ in 1978. It was sung\nand released by [Marti Webb](/wiki/Marti_Webb \"Marti Webb\") in 1980, and\nbecame a No.3 hit in the UK charts. The song was also popular in Ireland, and\nspent six weeks at number one. Later, _Tell Me on a Sunday_ was combined with\nanother Lloyd Webber work,\n_[Variations](/wiki/Variations_\\(Andrew_Lloyd_Webber_album\\) \"Variations\n\\(Andrew Lloyd Webber album\\)\")_ , to form an entire new show, _[Song and\nDance](/wiki/Song_and_Dance \"Song and Dance\")_.\n\nThe song is about a woman being told of her boyfriend's infidelity. The woman\ndenies this initially, before rebuking her newsbearer (a girlfriend) with the\nrevelation that she \"knew before\" and had done for some time. She also spends\nmuch of the song criticising her friend for rushing to break the \"bad news\" to\nher.\n\nDespite having been written during the creative process for _Tell Me on a\nSunday_ , the song wasn't recorded during the album's principal sessions.\nBlack reminded Lloyd Webber that they had missed a track, then entitled \"You\nMust Be Mistaken\". [John Mole](/wiki/John_Mole_\\(musician\\) \"John Mole\n\\(musician\\)\"), the [bass guitar](/wiki/Bass_guitar \"Bass guitar\") player,\nimprovised a part reminiscent of the arrangement style of [Phil\nSpector](/wiki/Phil_Spector \"Phil Spector\"), inspiring the rest of the\norchestration. The track was recorded in one take, apart from a [double\ntracking](/wiki/Double_tracking \"Double tracking\") of the orchestra.\n\nA briefer 3:02 edit of the song is included on the album, however, a longer\n3:29 version remixed with greater [dynamic range\ncompression](/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression \"Dynamic range\ncompression\")[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] was released as the\n[single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\").\n\n## Track\nlisting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Take_That_Look_Off_Your_Face&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Track listing\")]\n\n  * Side A: \"Take That Look Off Your Face\"\n  * Side B: \"Sheldon Bloom\"\n\n##\nRevisions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Take_That_Look_Off_Your_Face&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Revisions\")]\n\nThe lyrics were substantially rewritten by [Richard Maltby,\nJr](/wiki/Richard_Maltby,_Jr. \"Richard Maltby, Jr.\") for the original Broadway\nproduction of _Song and Dance_. The British productions of the show have\nalways used the lyrics written by Black.\n\nBlack himself amended the line, \"He's doing some deal up in Baltimore now\"\nafter realising that Baltimore is south of New York. In subsequent versions,\nthe song's protagonist is said to be \"down\" in Baltimore.\n\nFor the 2003 production of _Tell Me on a Sunday_ , the storyline instead\nplaced the action in England prior to an emigration to New York, requiring\nsome further revision of the lyrics to reference London instead.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Take_That_Look_Off_Your_Face&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  \n\n[![Stub icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Musical_notes.svg/30px-Musical_notes.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Musical_notes.svg) | _This 1970s song-related article is a[stub](/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub \"Wikipedia:Stub\").
