Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of\nstates has expanded from [the original 13](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies \"Thirteen\nColonies\") to 50. Each new state has been admitted on an [equal\nfooting](/wiki/Equal_footing \"Equal footing\") with the existing states.[5]\n\nThe following table is a list of all 50 states and their respective dates of\nstatehood. The first 13 became states in July 1776 upon agreeing to the\n[United States Declaration of\nIndependence](/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence \"United States\nDeclaration of Independence\"), and each joined the first Union of states\nbetween 1777 and 1781, upon ratifying the [Articles of\nConfederation](/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation \"Articles of Confederation\"),\nits first constitution.[6] (A separate table is included below showing AoC\nratification dates.) These states are presented in the order in which each\n[ratified](/wiki/Article_Seven_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article\nSeven of the United States Constitution\") the 1787 Constitution, thus joining\nthe present federal Union of states. The date of admission listed for each\nsubsequent state is the official date set by Act of Congress.[a]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 List of U.S. states\n  * 2 Articles of Confederation

for the [secession](/wiki/Secession \"Secession\") of 11 states (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas) during the [Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") to form the [Confederate States of America](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of America\"), nor for the subsequent restoration of those states to the Union, or each state's \"readmission to representation in Congress\" [after the war](/wiki/Reconstruction_Era \"Reconstruction Era\"), as the federal government does not give legal recognition to their having left the Union. Also, the Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede from the Union, but the [Supreme Court](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United States\") held that a state cannot unilaterally do so in _[Texas v. White](/wiki/Texas_v._White \"Texas v. White\")_ (1869).[7]\n  2. **Jump up ^** Also known as the \"Three Lower Counties Upon Delaware.\" Delaware became a state on June 15, 1776, when the Delaware Assembly formally adopted a resolution declaring an end to Delaware's status as a colony of Great Britain and establishing the three counties as an independent state under the authority of \"the Government of the Counties of New Castle, Kent and Sussex Upon Delaware.\"[9]\n  3. **Jump up ^** Between 1749 and 1764 the provincial governor of [New Hampshire](/wiki/Province_of_New_Hampshire \"Province of New Hampshire\"), [Benning Wentworth](/wiki/Benning_Wentworth \"Benning Wentworth\"), issued approximately 135 grants for unoccupied land claimed by New Hampshire west of the [Connecticut River](/wiki/Connecticut_River \"Connecticut River\") (in what is today southern Vermont), territory that was also claimed by [New York](/wiki/Province_of_New_York \"Province of New York\"). The resulting \"[New Hampshire Grants](/wiki/New_Hampshire_Grants \"New Hampshire Grants\")\" dispute led to the rise of the [Green Mountain Boys](/wiki/Green_Mountain_Boys \"Green Mountain Boys\"), and the later establishment of the Vermont Republic. New Hampshire's claim upon the land was extinguished in 1764 by [royal order](/wiki/Order_in_Council \"Order in Council\") of [George III](/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom \"George III of the United Kingdom\"), and in 1790 the State of New York [ceded](/wiki/Cession \"Cession\") its land claim to Vermont for 30,000 [Dollars](/wiki/Spanish_dollar \"Spanish dollar\").\n  4. **Jump up ^** The [Virginia General Assembly](/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly \"Virginia General Assembly\") adopted legislation on December 18, 1789 separating its \"District of Kentucky\" from the rest of the State and approving its statehood.[17]\n  5. **Jump up ^** The exact date upon which Ohio became a state is unclear. On April 30, 1802 the [7th Congress](/wiki/7th_United_States_Congress \"7th United States Congress\") had passed an [act](/wiki/Act_of_Congress \"Act of Congress\") \"authorizing the inhabitants of Ohio to form a Constitution and state government, and admission of Ohio into the Union.\" (Sess. 1, ch. 40, 2 [Stat.](/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large \"United States Statutes at Large\") [173](http://legislink.org/us/stat-2-173)) On February 19, 1803 the same Congress passed an act \"providing for the execution of the laws of the United States in the State of Ohio.\" (Sess. 2, ch. 7, 2 [Stat.](/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large \"United States Statutes at Large\") [201](http://legislink.org/us/stat-2-201)) Neither act, however, set a formal date of statehood. An official statehood date for Ohio was not set until 1953, when the [83rd Congress](/wiki/83rd_United_States_Congress \"83rd United States Congress\") passed a [Joint resolution](/wiki/Joint_resolution \"Joint resolution\") \"for admitting the State of Ohio into the Union\", ([Pub.L. 83–204](http://legislink.org/us/pl-83-204), 67 [Stat.](/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large \"United States Statutes at Large\") [407](http://legislink.org/us/stat-67-407), enacted August 7, 1953) which designated March 1, 1803, as that date.[20]\n  6. **Jump up ^** The [Massachusetts General Court](/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Court \"Massachusetts General Court\") passed enabling legislation on June 19, 1819 separating the \"District of Maine\" from the rest of the State (an action approved by the voters in Maine on July 19, 1819 by 17,001 to 7,132); then, on February 25, 1820, passed a follow-up measure officially accepting the fact of Maine's imminent statehood.[17]\n  7. **Jump up ^** On May 13, 1862, the General Assembly of the [Restored Government of Virginia](/wiki/Restored_Government_of_Virginia \"Restored Government of Virginia\") passed an act granting permission for creation of West Virginia.[34] Later, by its ruling in _[Virginia v. West Virginia](/wiki/Virginia_v._West_Virginia \"Virginia v. West Virginia\")_ (1871), the Supreme Court implicitly affirmed that the breakaway Virginia counties did have the proper consents necessary to become a separate state.[35]\n  8. **Jump up ^** When President [Benjamin Harrison](/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison \"Benjamin Harrison\") signed the statehood proclamations for North and South Dakota he shuffled the papers on his desk and covered up all but the signature line of the documents. No one knows which state he signed into existence first. North Dakota's proclamation was published first in the _[Statutes at Large](/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large \"United States Statutes at Large\")_ , as it is first in alphabetical order.[37]\n  9. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Brought into existence within moments of each other on the same day, North and South Dakota are the nation's only twin-born states.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_U.S._states_by_date_of_admission_to_the_Union&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Erler, Edward.

                "Answer Analysis": "The answer indicates that Hawaii is the youngest state.",
                "Document Content Analysis": "The document appears to be a webpage link or reference related to a list of U.S. states by their date of admission to the Union. It includes links to other language versions of the content.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document title suggests it covers 'U.S. states by date of admission to the Union', directly related to the query.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The content suggests it would list all states, which should include Hawaii, but the document details provided are insufficient to confirm this.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document likely contains key information about the dates of state admissions to the Union, relevant for determining the youngest state.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, based on the snippet alone, the document content is not visible, so it cannot be confirmed if it directly answers the query.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Yes, the document likely lists dates of admission, which can help infer which state is the youngest.",

                "Explanation": "The document provides potentially relevant context by listing states by admission date, which suffices for answering the query. However, the document content is insufficiently detailed in the snippet provided to confirm it directly names Hawaii as the youngest state."
