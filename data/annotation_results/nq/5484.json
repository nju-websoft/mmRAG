A bull rope is a fiber rope wrapped\naround the chest of the bull directly behind the bull's front legs, which the\nrider grips while riding. If he does that, it is a qualified ride. If he gets\nbucked off before eight seconds, it is a no score. In most bull riding\ncircuits, four judges mark scores for the rider and the bull. Two judges score\nthe rider based on his ability up to 25 points each for up to a total of 50\npoints. The other two judges score the bull on his bucking performance for up\nto 25 points each for a total of up to 50 points. Thus, the ride is scored up\nto 100 points. Most professional riders score between the mid-70s and high\n80s. American bull riding has been called \"the most dangerous eight seconds in\nsports.\"[1]\n\nOutside of the United States, bull riding traditions with varying rules and\nhistories also exist in Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,\nNicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Australia and\nNew Zealand with the majority of them following similar rules, especially with\nthe [Professional Bull Riders](/wiki/Professional_Bull_Riders \"Professional\nBull Riders\") organization.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Rules and regulations\n    * 2.1 Points and scoring\n  * 3 Equipment\n    * 3.1 Rider equipment\n    * 3.2 Bull equipment\n    * 3.3 The arena\n  * 4 North America\n  * 5 Australia and New Zealand\n  * 6 Animal welfare\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nThe taming of bulls has ancient roots in contests dating as far back as\n[Minoan](/wiki/Minoan_civilization \"Minoan civilization\") culture.[3] Bull\nriding itself has its direct roots in Mexican contests of equestrian and\nranching skills now collectively known as [charreada](/wiki/Charreada\n\"Charreada\").[3] During the 16th century, a hacienda contest called\n[jaripeo](/wiki/Jaripeo \"Jaripeo\") developed. Originally considered a variant\nof [bull fighting](/wiki/Bull_fighting \"Bull fighting\"), in which riders\nliterally rode a bull to death, the competition evolved into a form where the\nbull was simply ridden until it stopped bucking.[3] By the mid-19th century,\ncharreada competition was popular on Texas and California cattle ranches where\nAnglo and Hispanic ranch hands often worked together.[3]\n\nMany early [Texas rangers](/wiki/Texas_Ranger_Division \"Texas Ranger\nDivision\"), who had to be expert horsemen and later went on to become\n[ranchers](/wiki/Rancher \"Rancher\"), learned and adapted Hispanic techniques\nand traditions to ranches in the United States. Many also enjoyed traditional\nMexican celebrations, and H. L. Kinney, a rancher, promoter and former Texas\nRanger staged what is thought to be the first Anglo-American organized\nbullfight in the southwest in 1852. This event also included a jaripeo\ncompetition and was the subject of newspaper reports from as far away as the\n[New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\") Daily Delta.[3] However,\npopular sentiment shifted away from various [blood sports](/wiki/Blood_sport\n\"Blood sport\") and both bullfighting and prize fighting were banned by the\nTexas legislature in 1891.[3] In the same time period, however, [Wild West\nShows](/wiki/Wild_West_Show \"Wild West Show\") began to add steer riding to\ntheir exhibitions, choosing to use castrated animals because steers were\neasier to handle and transport than bulls.[3] Additionally, informal\n[rodeos](/wiki/Rodeo \"Rodeo\") began as competitions between neighboring\nranches in the [American Old West](/wiki/American_Old_West \"American Old\nWest\"). The location of the first formal Rodeo is debated. [Deer\nTrail](/wiki/Deer_Trail,_Colorado \"Deer Trail, Colorado\"), Colorado claims the\nfirst rodeo in 1869 but so does [Cheyenne, WY](/wiki/Cheyenne,_WY \"Cheyenne,\nWY\") in 1872.[4]\n\nAlthough steer riding contests existed into the 1920s, the sport did not gain\npopularity until bulls were returned to the arena and replaced steers as the\nmount of choice.[3] The first-known rodeo to use\n[brahma](/wiki/Brahman_\\(cattle\\) \"Brahman \\(cattle\\)\") bulls was in Columbia,\nMississippi, produced in 1935 by Canadian brothers [Earl and Weldon\nBascom](/wiki/Earl_W._Bascom \"Earl W. Bascom\") with Jake Lybbert and Waldo\nRoss. This rodeo was the first to feature a bull riding event at a night rodeo\nheld outdoors under electric lights. A pivotal moment for modern bull riding,\nand rodeo in general, came with the founding of the Rodeo Cowboy Association\n(RCA) in 1936, which later became the [Professional Rodeo Cowboys\nAssociation](/wiki/Professional_Rodeo_Cowboys_Association \"Professional Rodeo\nCowboys Association\") (PRCA). Through this organization many hundreds of\nrodeos are held each year. Since that time, the popularity of all aspects of\nthe rodeo has risen. In addition to the PRCA, which has PRCA ProRodeo with\nbull riding and the Xtreme Bulls events for bull riding only, there are two\nseparate organizations that promote and produce shows for stand-alone\nprofessional bull riding in the United States: [Championship Bull\nRiding](/wiki/Championship_Bull_Riding \"Championship Bull Riding\") (CBR) and\n[Professional Bull Riders](/wiki/Professional_Bull_Riders \"Professional Bull\nRiders\") (PBR). CBR tours all over the United States and its major league\ntour, the Road to Cheyenne Tour, is broadcast on [Fox Sports\nNetworks](/wiki/Fox_Sports_Networks \"Fox Sports Networks\"). The CBR world\nchampionships take place at [Cheyenne Frontier\nDays](/wiki/Cheyenne_Frontier_Days \"Cheyenne Frontier Days\"). The\n[Professional Bull Riders](/wiki/Professional_Bull_Riders \"Professional Bull\nRiders\") (PBR) stages a large number of events in the United States, Canada,\nMexico, Brazil, and Australia. For many years the annual [PBR World\nFinals](/wiki/PBR_World_Finals \"PBR World Finals\") were held at the [Thomas\nand Mack Center](/wiki/Thomas_and_Mack_Center \"Thomas and Mack Center\") in\n[Las Vegas, Nevada](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley \"Las Vegas Valley\"). However,\nstarting in 2016, the Finals are now held at the [T-Mobile\nArena](/wiki/T-Mobile_Arena \"T-Mobile Arena\") in Las Vegas.[5] The PBR's major\nleague tour, the [Built Ford Tough Series](/wiki/Built_Ford_Tough_Series\n\"Built Ford Tough Series\"), is broadcast on [CBS Sports\nNetwork](/wiki/CBS_Sports_Network \"CBS Sports Network\"), with the primary\nbroadcast network televising selected bonus rounds (known as 15/15 bucking\nbattles). From these roots, bull riding as a competitive sport has spread to a\nnumber of other nations worldwide.\n\n## Rules and\nregulations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Rules and regulations\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Bull-Riding-\nSzmurlo.jpg/220px-Bull-Riding-Szmurlo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bull-Riding-\nSzmurlo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bull-Riding-Szmurlo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBull riding at the [Calgary Stampede](/wiki/Calgary_Stampede \"Calgary\nStampede\"). The \"bullfighter\" or \"rodeo clown\" is standing just to the right\nof the bull\n\nEach bull has a unique name and number used to help identify it. A sufficient\nnumber of bulls, each judged to be of good strength, health, agility, and age,\nare selected to perform. The rider and bull are matched randomly before the\ncompetition, although starting in 2008, some ranked riders are allowed to\nchoose their own bulls from a bull draft for selected rounds in PBR events.\n\nA rider mounts a bull and grips a flat braided rope. After they secure a good\ngrip on the rope, the rider nods to signal they are ready. The bucking chute\n(a small enclosure which opens from the side) is opened and the bull storms\nout into the arena. The rider must attempt to stay on the bull for at least\neight seconds, while only touching the bull with their riding hand. The other\nhand must remain free for the duration of the ride. Originally, the rules\nrequired a 10-second ride, but that was changed to the current eight seconds.\n\nThe bull bucks, rears, kicks, spins, and twists in an effort to throw the\nrider off. This continues for a number of seconds until the rider bucks off or\ndismounts after completing the ride. A loud buzzer or whistle announces the\ncompletion of an eight-second ride.\n\nThroughout the ride, bullfighters, also popularly known as [rodeo\nclowns](/wiki/Rodeo_clown \"Rodeo clown\"), stay near the bull to aid the rider\nif necessary. When the ride ends, either intentionally or not, the\nbullfighters distract the bull to protect the rider from harm.\n\nMany competitions have a format that involves multiple rounds, sometimes\ncalled \"go-rounds\". Generally, events span two to three nights. The rider is\ngiven a chance to ride one bull per night. The total points scored by the end\nof the event are recorded, and after the first or first two go rounds, the top\n20 riders are given a chance to ride one more bull. This final round is called\nthe \"short go\". After the end of the short go, the rider with the most total\npoints wins the event.\n\n### Points and\nscoring[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Points and scoring\")]\n\nThe ride is scored from 0–100 points. Both the rider and the bull are awarded\npoints. There are usually two judges, each judge scoring the bull from 0–50\npoints, and the rider from 0–50 points. The combined point totals from both\njudges make up the final score for the ride. This system was spearheaded by\nformer PRCA president [Dale Smith](/wiki/Dale_Smith_\\(cowboy\\) \"Dale Smith\n\\(cowboy\\)\").[6] Scores of zero are quite common as many riders lose control\nof the animal almost immediately after the bull leaves the bucking chute. Many\nexperienced professionals are able to earn scores of 75 or more. Scores above\n80 are considered excellent, and a score in the 90s exceptional.\n\n[Judges](/wiki/Adjudicator \"Adjudicator\") award points based on several key\naspects of the ride. Judges look for constant control and rhythm in the rider\nin matching their movements with the bull. Points are usually deducted if a\nrider is constantly off balance. For points actually to be awarded the rider\nmust stay mounted for a minimum of 8 seconds, and they are scored only for\nactions during those 8 seconds. The ability to control the bull well allows\nriders to gain extra _style_ points. These are often gained by spurring the\nanimal. A rider is disqualified for touching the bull, the rope, or themselves\nwith their free arm.[7]\n\nBulls have more raw power and a different style of movement from [bucking\nhorses](/wiki/Saddle_bronc \"Saddle bronc\"). One move particular to bulls is a\nbelly roll or _sunfishing_ , in which the bull is completely off the ground\nand kicks either his hind feet or all four feet to the side in a twisting,\nrolling motion. Bulls also are more likely than horses to spin in tight, quick\ncircles, while they are less likely to run or to jump extremely high and\n\"break in two\".\n\nFor the bull, judges look at the animal's overall agility, power and speed;\nits back end kicks; and its front end drops. In general, if a bull gives a\nrider a very hard time, more points will be awarded. If a rider fails to stay\nmounted for at least 8 seconds the bull is still awarded a score.[7] The\n[PBR](/wiki/Professional_Bull_Riders \"Professional Bull Riders\"),\n[CBR](/wiki/Championship_Bull_Riding \"Championship Bull Riding\"),\n[PRCA](/wiki/Professional_Rodeo_Cowboys_Association \"Professional Rodeo\nCowboys Association\"), IPRA and [PRS](/wiki/Professional_Roughstock_Series\n\"Professional Roughstock Series\") record bulls' past scores so that the best\nbulls can be brought to the finals, ensuring that riders will be given a\nchance to score highly. All five organizations also award one bull the\n\"Bucking Bull of the Year\" award, decided by scores and the number of riders\nit has bucked off. The award brings prestige to the ranch at which the bull\nwas raised.\n\nIf a rider scores sufficiently low due to poor bull performance, the judges\nmay offer the rider the option of a re-ride. By taking the option, the rider\ngives up the score received, waits until all other riders have ridden, and\nrides again. This can be risky because the rider loses their score and risks\nbeing bucked off and receiving no score. A re-ride may also be given if a bull\nstumbles or runs into the fence or gate.\n\n## Equipment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Equipment\")]\n\n### Rider\nequipment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Rider equipment\")]\n\nBull riders use many pieces of equipment both functionally and to ensure\nmaximum [safety](/wiki/Safety \"Safety\"), both to themselves and to the animals\ninvolved.\n\nThe primary piece of equipment used is the _bull rope_. The bull rope is a\nbraided rope made of polypropylene, grass, or some combination. A handle is\nbraided into the center of the rope and is usually stiffened with leather. One\nside of the rope is tied in an adjustable knot that can be changed for the\nsize of bull. The other side of the rope (the tail) is a flat braid and is\nusually coated with [rosin](/wiki/Rosin \"Rosin\") to keep it from sliding\nthrough the rider's hand. A metallic bell is strapped to the knot and hangs\ndirectly under the bull throughout the ride. In addition to the sound the bell\nproduces, it also gives the rope some weight, allowing it to fall off the bull\nonce a rider has dismounted.\n\n[Chaps](/wiki/Chaps \"Chaps\") are probably the most noticeable piece of bull\nrider clothing, as their distinctive coloring and patterns add flair to the\nsport. Usually made of leather, chaps also provide protection for the rider's\nlegs and thighs.\n\nBull riders are required to wear a protective vest, most usually wear one made\nof high impact foam that allows the shock to disperse over a wide area,\nthereby reducing pain and injury.\n\nTo prevent a [rope burn](/wiki/Rope_burn \"Rope burn\"), riders must wear a\nprotective [glove](/wiki/Glove \"Glove\"), usually of [leather](/wiki/Leather\n\"Leather\"). This glove must be fastened to the rider's hand since the force\nthe animal is able to exert could tear the glove away. The rider often applies\n[rosin](/wiki/Rosin \"Rosin\") to the glove, which allows for additional grip.\n\n[Cowboy boots](/wiki/Cowboy_boot \"Cowboy boot\") are also worn. The dull and\nloosely locked spurs help keep the rider balanced and is crucial piece of\nequipment to the sport as a whole. The bulls are unharmed by the\n[rowels](/wiki/Spur#Design \"Spur\"), as their hide is roughly seven times\nthicker than a human being's skin. Truly skilled riders will often _spur_ the\nbull in the hope of achieving extra style points from the judges.\n\n[Cowboy hats](/wiki/Cowboy_hat \"Cowboy hat\") remain the primary headwear used.\nWhile the professional organizations permit protective helmets and masks, some\nriders continue to believe that this equipment can detrimentally affect\nbalance, and many professionals still avoid wearing them. However, the trend\nis changing, as more champion riders begin to wear helmets for added safety.\n\nPublic health researchers found evidence suggesting that bull riding helmets\nare protective, when riders wearing one particular type of helmet suffered\napproximately 50% fewer head and facial injuries.[8][9] In 2004, at the 1st\nInternational Rodeo Research and Clinical Care Conference in Calgary, Alberta,\nCanada, a group of top rodeo medicine researchers and clinical care providers\ncame to a consensus on the use of helmets declaring that all youth rodeo\nparticipants should wear helmets, and that helmets should be recommended for\nadult bull riders.[10]\n\nFor competitors under the age of 18, protective headgear incorporating a\n[helmet](/wiki/Helmet \"Helmet\") and [ice hockey](/wiki/Ice_hockey \"Ice\nhockey\") style face mask are worn. While optional at the upper levels of the\nsport, it has become mandatory at younger levels, and riders who use helmets\nand face masks as youths tend to continue to wearing them as they reach\nadulthood and turn professional.[11]\n\n### Bull equipment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Bull equipment\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/California_rodeo_Salinas_lasso_bull_p1050544.jpg/220px-\nCalifornia_rodeo_Salinas_lasso_bull_p1050544.jpg)](/wiki/File:California_rodeo_Salinas_lasso_bull_p1050544.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:California_rodeo_Salinas_lasso_bull_p1050544.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThis bull is wearing a flank strap.\n\nThe _flank strap_ is a rope made of a soft cotton rope at least 5/8” in\ndiameter is acceptable as a flank strap and does not require extra padding\nwith sheepskin or neoprene. It is tied around the bull's flank.[12] Contrary\nto popular belief, the flank strap is not tied around the bull's testicles.\nThis rope is to encourage the bull to use its hind legs more in a bucking\nmotion, as this is a true test of a rider's skill in maintaining the ride. If\nit is applied improperly a rider may request to ride again, as the bull will\nnot buck well if the flank strap is too tight. The flank strap is applied by\nthe [stock contractor](/wiki/Stock_contractor \"Stock contractor\") or his\ndesignate.\n\n### The arena[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: The arena\")]\n\nThe _arenas_ used in professional bull riding vary. Some are rodeo arenas that\nare used only for bull riding and other rodeo events. Others are event centers\nthat play host to many different sports. Common to all arenas is a large, open\narea that gives the bulls, bull riders, and bull fighters plenty of room to\nmaneuver. The area is fenced, usually 6 to 7 feet high, to protect the\naudience from escaped bulls. There are generally exits on each corner of the\narena for riders to get out of the way quickly. Riders can also hop onto the\nfence to avoid danger. One end of the arena contains the bucking chutes from\nwhich the bulls are released. There is also an exit chute where the bulls can\nexit the arena.\n\n## North America[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: North America\")]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, most professional bull riders start out\nriding in [high school rodeo](/wiki/NHSRA \"NHSRA\") or other junior\nassociations. From there, riders may go on the [college rodeo\ncircuit](/wiki/National_Intercollegiate_Rodeo_Association \"National\nIntercollegiate Rodeo Association\") or to one of several semi-pro associations\nincluding the [Southern Extreme Bull Riding Association](/wiki/SEBRA \"SEBRA\")\n(SEBRA), the Southern States Bull Riders Association (SSBR), the International\nBull Riders Association (IBR), the Professional Championship Bull Riders Tour\n(PCB), Bull Riders Canada (BRC), the American Bull Riders Tour (ABT), the\nInternational Professional Rodeo Association (IPRA), the United Professional\nRodeo Association (UPRA), the Southern Rodeo Association (SRA), the\nProfessional Western Rodeo Association (PWRA), the Canadian Cowboys\nAssociation (CCA), among others. Bull riders compete in these organizations as\nthey are climbing the ladder to the professional ranks and to supplement their\nincome.\n\nThe top bull riders in the world compete on the Professional Bull Riders\n(PBR), Championship Bull Riding (CBR) and Professional Rodeo Cowboys\nAssociation (PRCA) circuits. Most of the riders who compete in the CBR tour\nalso compete in the PRCA's rodeos and 'Xtreme Bulls' tour (a small series of\none day bull riding events sanctioned by the PRCA), while only a handful of\nPBR riders also compete in the PRCA. Professional bull riders can win in\nexcess of $100,000 a year while competing in any of these three organizations.\n\nIn Mexico, there are several local American-style bull riding organizations.\n\n## Australia and New\nZealand[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Australia and New Zealand\")]\n\nThere are approximately 200 rodeos and bushmen's carnivals held annually\nacross Australia. At most of these events bull riding is one of the featured\ncompetitions.\n\nInitially [bullocks](/wiki/Ox \"Ox\") and steers were used for roughriding\nevents and these were owned by local graziers that lent them for these events.\nNowadays bulls are used for the open events and [stock\ncontractors](/wiki/Stock_contractor \"Stock contractor\") supply the various\nroughriding associations. Contract stock has produced a more uniform range of\nbucking stock which is also quieter to handle. The competitions are run and\nscored in a similar style to that used in the United States.[13]\n\nIn May 1992 the National Rodeo Council of Australia (NRCA) was formed to\npromote and further the sport of rodeo and has represented the following\nassociations, which also control bull riding:\n\n  * Australian Bushmen’s Campdraft & Rodeo Association (ABCRA)\n  * Australian Professional Bull Riders Association (APBA)\n  * Central Rodeo Cowboys Association (CRCA)\n  * Indigenous Rodeo Riders Australia (IRRA)\n  * National Student Rodeo Association (NSRA)\n  * National Rodeo Association (NRA)\n  * Northern Cowboys Association (NCA)\n  * Queensland Rodeo Association (QRA)\n  * Rodeo Services Association (RSA)\n  * West Coast Rodeo Circuit (WCRC)[14]\n\nThere are strict standards for the selection, care and treatment of rodeo\nlivestock, arenas, plus equipment requirements and specifications.[15]\n\nChainsaw was one of Australia's most famous bucking bulls. Only nine\ncontestants scored on him and he won the Australian national title of Bull of\nthe Year a world record eight times during 1987 to 1994.[16]\n\nSome of Australia’s best bull riders travel and compete internationally in\nCanada, [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\") and the United States.\nSome of Australia's leading bull riders conduct bull riding clinics to assist\nlearners and novice riders.[17]\n\nA World Challenge of Professional Bull Riders (PBR) was held on 29 May 2010 at\nthe [Brisbane Entertainment Centre](/wiki/Brisbane_Entertainment_Centre\n\"Brisbane Entertainment Centre\") (BEC). The 2010 PBR Finals were held over two\nnights at the [Australian Equine and Livestock Events\nCentre](/wiki/Australian_Equine_and_Livestock_Events_Centre \"Australian Equine\nand Livestock Events Centre\") (AELEC), with five top-ranked professional bull\nriders from the United States and 25 of Australia’s best bull riders\ncontesting the event.[18]\n\nRodeo is also popular in country regions of New Zealand where approximately 32\nrodeos, which include bull riding contests, are held each summer.[19]\n\n## Animal welfare[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Animal welfare\")]\n\nFor more details on this topic, see [Rodeo § Animal treatment\ncontroversies](/wiki/Rodeo#Animal_treatment_controversies \"Rodeo\").\n\nThere is debate between animal rights/welfare organizations and bull riding\nenthusiasts over many aspects of the sport. One source of controversy is the\nflank strap. The flank strap is placed around a bull's flank, just in front of\nthe hind legs, to encourage bucking. Critics say that the flank strap\nencircles or otherwise binds the genitals of the bull. However, the flank\nstrap is anatomically impossible to place over the testicles. Many point out\nthat the bull's genes are valuable and that there is a strong economic\nincentive to keep the animal in good reproductive health. Further,\nparticularly in the case of bulls, an animal that is sick and in pain usually\nwill not want to move at all, will not buck as well, and may even lie down in\nthe chute or ring rather than buck.[20]\n\nCritics also claim that electric [cattle prods](/wiki/Cattle_prods \"Cattle\nprods\") (\"hot shots\") are used to injure and torture bulls, while supporters\nof bull riding claim that the cattle prod simply gets the bull out of the\nchute quickly and is only a moderate irritation due to the thickness of the\nanimal's hide. Cattle prods have not been used in the [Professional Bull\nRiders](/wiki/Professional_Bull_Riders \"Professional Bull Riders\") (PBR) tour\nfor several years. However, in smaller associations, a cattle prod is still\nsometimes used to ensure that the animal leaves the chute as soon as the rider\nnods their head. Cattle prods are not allowed by any major association.\n\n[Spurs](/wiki/Spur \"Spur\") are also a source of controversy, though modern\nrodeo rules place strict regulations on the type and use of spurs and\nparticipants point out that they are a tool commonly used in other non-rodeo\n[equestrian](/wiki/Equestrianism \"Equestrianism\") disciplines. Spurs used in\nbull riding do not have a fixed rowel, nor can they be sharpened. The PBR\ncurrently allows only two types of rowels to ensure the safety of the animals.\n\nBull riding has the highest rate of injury to humans of any rodeo sport. It\naccounts for approximately 50% of all traumatic injuries to rodeo contestants,\nand the bullfighters have the highest injury rate of any non-contestant\ngroup.[21]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Steer riding](/wiki/Steer_riding \"Steer riding\")\n  * [Mechanical bull](/wiki/Mechanical_bull \"Mechanical bull\")\n  * [Bronc riding](/wiki/Bronc_riding \"Bronc riding\")\n  * [Jineteada gaucha](/wiki/Jineteada_gaucha \"Jineteada gaucha\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bull_riding&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Facing the Bull: The Most Dangerous Eight Seconds in Sports\"](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/02/0225_040225_TVbullrider.html). _news.nationalgeographic.com_.
