In 1754, 22 noblemen, professors, and landowners founded\nthe Society of St Andrews Golfers. This society would eventually become the\nprecursor to the [Royal and Ancient](/wiki/Royal_and_Ancient \"Royal and\nAncient\") which is the governing body for golf everywhere outside of the\n[United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") and [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico\n\"Mexico\").[6] St Andrews Links had a scare when they went bankrupt in 1797.[6]\nThe Town Council of St. Andrews decided to allow rabbit farming on the golf\ncourse to challenge golf for popularity. Twenty years of legal battling\nbetween the golfers and rabbit farmers ended in 1821 when a local landowner\nand golfer named James Cheape of [Strathtyrum](/wiki/Strathtyrum\n\"Strathtyrum\") bought the land and is credited with saving the links for\ngolf.[4] The course evolved without the help of any one architect for many\nyears, though notable contributions to its design were made by Daw Anderson in\nthe 1850s and Old Tom Morris (1865–1908), who designed the 1st and 18th holes.\nOriginally, it was played over the same set of fairways out and back to the\nsame holes. As interest in the game increased, groups of golfers would often\nbe playing the same hole, but going in different directions.[4]\n\n### Influence on modern\ngolf[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Old_Course_at_St_Andrews&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Influence on modern golf\")]\n\nThe Old Course was pivotal to the development of how the game is played today.\nFor instance, in 1764, the course had 22 holes. The members would play the\nsame hole going out and in with the exception of the 11th and 22nd holes. The\nmembers decided that the first four and last four holes on the course were too\nshort and should be combined into four total holes (two in and two out). St\nAndrews then had 18 holes and that was how the standard of 18 holes was\ncreated.[7] Around 1863, [Old Tom Morris](/wiki/Old_Tom_Morris \"Old Tom\nMorris\") had the 1st green separated from the 17th green, producing the\ncurrent 18-hole layout with seven double greens and four single greens. The\nOld Course is home of [The Open Championship](/wiki/The_Open_Championship \"The\nOpen Championship\"), the oldest of golf's major championships. The Old Course\nhas hosted this major 29 times since 1873, most recently in 2015. The 29 [Open\nChampionships](/wiki/Open_Championship \"Open Championship\") that the Old\nCourse has hosted is more than any other course, and The Open is currently\nplayed there every five years.\n\n### Old Course and Bobby\nJones[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Old_Course_at_St_Andrews&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Old Course and Bobby Jones\")]\n\n[Bobby Jones](/wiki/Bobby_Jones_\\(golfer\\) \"Bobby Jones \\(golfer\\)\") (who\nlater founded [Augusta National](/wiki/Augusta_National \"Augusta National\"))\nfirst played St Andrews in the 1921 [Open\nChampionship](/wiki/Open_Championship \"Open Championship\"). During the third\nround, he infamously hit his ball into a bunker on the 11th hole. After he\ntook four swings at the ball and still could not get out, after losing his\ntemper, he continued the round, but did not turn in score card, thus\ndisqualifying himself. However, he did continue to play in the fourth round.\nSix years later, when the Open Championship returned to St Andrews, Jones also\nreturned. Not only did he win, he also became the first amateur to win back-\nto-back Open Championships. He won wire-to-wire, shooting a 285 (7-under-par),\nwhich was the lowest score at either a [U.S. Open](/wiki/U.S._Open_\\(golf\\)\n\"U.S. Open \\(golf\\)\") or Open Championship at the time. He ended up winning\nthe tournament by a decisive six strokes.\n\nIn 1930, Jones returned to St Andrews for the [British\nAmateur](/wiki/The_Amateur_Championship \"The Amateur Championship\").[8] He\nwon, beating [Roger Wethered](/wiki/Roger_Wethered \"Roger Wethered\") by a\nscore of 7 and 6 in the final match. He subsequently won the other three\nmajors, making him the only man in the history of the sport to win the [Grand\nSlam](/wiki/Grand_Slam_\\(golf\\) \"Grand Slam \\(golf\\)\"). Jones went on to fall\nin love with the Old Course for the rest of his life. Years later, he said \"If\nI had to select one course upon which to play the match of my life, I should\nhave selected the Old Course.\" In 1958 the town of St Andrews gave Jones the\n[key to the city](/wiki/Freedom_of_the_City#Key_to_the_City \"Freedom of the\nCity\"); he was only the second American to receive the honour (after [Benjamin\nFranklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\") in 1759). After he\nreceived the key, he said \"I could take out of my life everything but my\nexperiences here in St. Andrews and I would still have had a rich and full\nlife.\"[9]\n\n##\nFeatures[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Old_Course_at_St_Andrews&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Features\")]\n\n\"I'm very sentimental and the place gets to me every time I go there.

The\n[Swilcan Bridge](/wiki/Swilcan_Bridge \"Swilcan Bridge\"), spanning the first\nand 18th holes, has become a famous icon for golf in the world.[11] Everyone\nwho plays the 18th hole walks over this 700-year-old bridge, and many iconic\npictures of the farewells of the most iconic golfers in history have been\ntaken on this bridge.[12] A life-size stone replica of the Bridge is situated\nat the [World Golf Hall of Fame](/wiki/World_Golf_Hall_of_Fame \"World Golf\nHall of Fame\") museum in [St. Augustine, Florida](/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida\n\"St. Augustine, Florida\").[12] Only the 1st, 9th, 17th and 18th holes have\ntheir own greens. Another unique feature is that the course can be played in\neither direction, clockwise or anti-clockwise. Along with that, the Old Course\nhas 112 bunkers which are all individually named and have their own unique\nstory and history behind them. The two most famous are the 10 ft deep \"Hell\nBunker\"[13] on the 14th hole, and the \"Road Bunker\" on the 17th hole.\nCountless professional golfers have seen their dreams of winning the [Open\nChampionship](/wiki/Open_Championship \"Open Championship\") squandered by\nhitting their balls into those bunkers.\n\nThe Old Course is also home of _The Road Hole_ , the par-4 17th, one of the\nworld's most famous golf holes. Among its unique features are:\n\n  * Players using the back tees cannot see where their tee shots land. This is not unusual except that they must take aim over a corner of replica railway sheds which lie beyond the out of bounds wall. The original sheds were torn down when the rail line running next to the course closed, and after several Opens were played without the tee shot being blind, replicas of the sheds were created in preparation for the 1984 Open.\n  * Other than [rough](/wiki/Rough_\\(golf\\) \"Rough \\(golf\\)\"), the primary hazard in front of the green is a sand trap known as the \"Road Bunker.\"\n  * Over the back of the green, hazards include a [tarmac](/wiki/Tarmac \"Tarmac\") roadway, as well as an old stone wall. Both are in play; a wayward shot can lead a player to take their next stroke off the roadway or to hit the face of the wall and take their chances with the ensuing bounce.\n\nThe general method of play today is counterclockwise, although clockwise play\nhas been permitted on one day each year in recent years, and for several\nspecial one off events since. Originally, the course was reversed every week\nin order to let the grass recover better. One other unusual thing about the\nOld Course is that it is closed on Sundays to let the course rest.[14] On some\nSundays, the course turns into a park for all the townspeople who come out to\nstroll, picnic and otherwise enjoy the grounds. As a general rule, Sunday play\nis allowed on the course on only four occasions:\n\n  * The final day of the [Dunhill Links Championship](/wiki/Dunhill_Links_Championship \"Dunhill Links Championship\"), an annual event on the [European Tour](/wiki/European_Tour \"European Tour\").\n  * The final day of any R&A sanctioned Open Championships – [men](/wiki/The_Open_Championship \"The Open Championship\") and [women](/wiki/Women%27s_British_Open \"Women's British Open\"), and the [men over 50](/wiki/Senior_Open_Championship \"Senior Open Championship\") when it is held at the Old Course; this happens roughly once every five years for the men; the women's championship began its turn on the rotation in 2007, and the over-50 championship began in 2018.\n  * The final day of two top amateur events, the [St Andrews Links Trophy](/wiki/St_Andrews_Links_Trophy \"St Andrews Links Trophy\") and the St Rule Trophy.\n\nSunday play may also occur when the Old Course hosts other major events; for\nexample, when it hosted the [Curtis Cup](/wiki/Curtis_Cup \"Curtis Cup\") in\n2008.\n\nWhile winning the Open Championship is a crowning achievement for any golfer,\na win at St Andrews is considered particularly important due to the course's\nlong tradition. Past winners at St Andrews include [Tiger\nWoods](/wiki/Tiger_Woods \"Tiger Woods\") (twice), [Louis\nOosthuizen](/wiki/Louis_Oosthuizen \"Louis Oosthuizen\"), [John\nDaly](/wiki/John_Daly_\\(golfer\\) \"John Daly \\(golfer\\)\"), [Zach\nJohnson](/wiki/Zach_Johnson \"Zach Johnson\") (first Monday finish since 1988),\n[Nick Faldo](/wiki/Nick_Faldo \"Nick Faldo\"), [Seve\nBallesteros](/wiki/Seve_Ballesteros \"Seve Ballesteros\"), [Jack\nNicklaus](/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus \"Jack Nicklaus\") (twice), [Tony\nLema](/wiki/Tony_Lema \"Tony Lema\"), [Kel Nagle](/wiki/Kel_Nagle \"Kel Nagle\"),\n[Bobby Locke](/wiki/Bobby_Locke \"Bobby Locke\"), [Peter\nThomson](/wiki/Peter_Thomson_\\(golfer\\) \"Peter Thomson \\(golfer\\)\"), [Sam\nSnead](/wiki/Sam_Snead \"Sam Snead\"), [Dick\nBurton](/wiki/Dick_Burton_\\(golfer\\) \"Dick Burton \\(golfer\\)\"), [Denny\nShute](/wiki/Denny_Shute \"Denny Shute\"), [Bobby\nJones](/wiki/Bobby_Jones_\\(golfer\\) \"Bobby Jones \\(golfer\\)\"), [Jock\nHutchison](/wiki/Jock_Hutchison \"Jock Hutchison\"), [James\nBraid](/wiki/James_Braid_\\(golfer\\) \"James Braid \\(golfer\\)\") (twice), [John\nHenry Taylor](/wiki/John_Henry_Taylor \"John Henry Taylor\") (twice), [Hugh\nKirkaldy](/wiki/Hugh_Kirkaldy \"Hugh Kirkaldy\"), [Jack\nBurns](/wiki/Jack_Burns_\\(golfer\\) \"Jack Burns \\(golfer\\)\"), [Bob\nMartin](/wiki/Bob_Martin_\\(golfer\\) \"Bob Martin \\(golfer\\)\") (twice), [Jamie\nAnderson](/wiki/Jamie_Anderson_\\(golfer\\) \"Jamie Anderson \\(golfer\\)\"), [Tom\nKidd](/wiki/Tom_Kidd_\\(golfer\\) \"Tom Kidd \\(golfer\\)\"), [Lorena\nOchoa](/wiki/Lorena_Ochoa \"Lorena Ochoa\"), and most recently [Stacy\nLewis](/wiki/Stacy_Lewis \"Stacy Lewis\") at the [2013 Women's British\nOpen](/wiki/2013_Women%27s_British_Open \"2013 Women's British Open\").\n\nIn 2005 the Old Course was ranked as the greatest golf course outside the\nUnited States, by _[Golf Digest](/wiki/Golf_Digest \"Golf Digest\")_.\n\nSince 1990, the Old Course has been unique on the Open roster in holding the\nChampionship every five years. However, this sequence has been broken with the\nannouncement that the 2020 Championship will be at [Royal St.\nGeorge's](/wiki/Royal_St._George%27s \"Royal St. George's\"). The reason for\nthis is that the 2021 Championship will be the 150th, and is expected to be\nplayed on the Old Course although no official announcement has yet been made.\n\n## The Open\nChampionship[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Old_Course_at_St_Andrews&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: The Open Championship\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Road_hole_bunker.jpg/220px-\nRoad_hole_bunker.jpg)](/wiki/File:Road_hole_bunker.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Road_hole_bunker.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe \"road bunker\" at the 17th hole.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Old_Course_Clubhouse_St_Andrews.JPG/220px-\nOld_Course_Clubhouse_St_Andrews.JPG)](/wiki/File:Old_Course_Clubhouse_St_Andrews.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Old_Course_Clubhouse_St_Andrews.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nR&A Clubhouse on the Old Course.\n\n[The Open Championship](/wiki/The_Open_Championship \"The Open Championship\")\nhas been staged at the Old Course at St Andrews 29 times.
