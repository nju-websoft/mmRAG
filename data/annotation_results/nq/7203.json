It is the fifth major\ninstallment in the _[Assassin's Creed](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed \"Assassin's\nCreed\")_ series, and a direct sequel to 2011's _[Assassin's Creed:\nRevelations](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Revelations \"Assassin's Creed:\nRevelations\")_. The game was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Xbox\n360, beginning in North America on October 30, 2012, with a Wii U and\nMicrosoft Windows release following in November 2012.\n\nThe plot is set in a [fictional history](/wiki/Historical_fiction \"Historical\nfiction\") of real world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between\nthe [Assassins](/wiki/Assassins \"Assassins\"), who fight for peace with free\nwill, and the [Templars](/wiki/Knights_Templar \"Knights Templar\"), who desire\npeace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and\nfeatures series protagonist [Desmond Miles](/wiki/Desmond_Miles \"Desmond\nMiles\") who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the\nmemories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [2012\napocalypse](/wiki/2012_phenomenon \"2012 phenomenon\"). The story is set in the\n18th century, before, during and after the [American\nRevolution](/wiki/American_Revolution \"American Revolution\") from 1754 to\n1783, and follows Desmond's half-English, half-[Mohawk](/wiki/Mohawk_people\n\"Mohawk people\") ancestor,\n[Ratonhnhaké:ton](/wiki/List_of_Assassin%27s_Creed_characters#Ratonhnhaké:ton\n\"List of Assassin's Creed characters\")\n([/ˈrəduːnˈhəɡeɪduːn/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\")), also known\nas Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain control in the\ncolonies.\n\n_Assassin 's Creed III_ is set in an [open world](/wiki/Open_world \"Open\nworld\") and presented from the [third-person perspective](/wiki/Third-\nperson_perspective \"Third-person perspective\") with a primary focus on using\nDesmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and\nexplore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston,\nNew York City, and the American frontier to complete side missions away from\nthe primary storyline. The game also features a multiplayer component,\nallowing players to compete online to complete solo and team based objectives\nincluding assassinations and evading pursuers. Ubisoft developed a new game\nengine, [Anvil Next](/wiki/Anvil_\\(game_engine\\) \"Anvil \\(game engine\\)\"), for\nthe game.[9]\n\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, who praised it for its\ngameplay, narrative, diverse cast of characters, visuals and grand, ambitious\nscale, while criticism was directed at the unevenly developed gameplay\nmechanics and the glitches within the game. It was a massive commercial\nsuccess, selling more than 12 million copies worldwide. Its sequel,\n_[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_IV:_Black_Flag\n\"Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag\")_, was released in October 2013, and follows\nRatonhnhaké:ton's grandfather – [Edward Kenway](/wiki/Edward_Kenway \"Edward\nKenway\") – a pirate and Assassin operating in the [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean\n\"Caribbean\") during the [Golden Age of Piracy](/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Piracy\n\"Golden Age of Piracy\").[10]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Gameplay\n  * 2 Synopsis\n    * 2.1 Setting\n    * 2.2 Characters\n    * 2.3 Plot\n  * 3 Development\n    * 3.1 Origins\n    * 3.2 Pre-announcement\n      * 3.2.1 Internal leaks\n    * 3.3 Post-announcement\n  * 4 Music\n  * 5 Marketing\n    * 5.1 Allegations of pro-American and anti-British prejudice\n    * 5.2 Retail editions\n  * 6 Downloadable content\n    * 6.1 Uplay content\n    * 6.2 _The Hidden Secrets_ Pack\n    * 6.3 _The Battle Hardened_ Pack\n    * 6.4 _The Tyranny of King Washington_\n  * 7 Reception\n    * 7.1 Awards\n    * 7.2 Sales\n    * 7.3 Technical issues\n  * 8 Series continuation\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nGameplay[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Assassin%27s_Creed_III&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Gameplay\")]\n\nMain article: [Gameplay in the Assassin's Creed\nseries](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed#Gameplay \"Assassin's Creed\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1c/Assassins-creed-iii-\nscreenshot.jpg/220px-Assassins-creed-iii-\nscreenshot.jpg)](/wiki/File:Assassins-creed-iii-screenshot.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Assassins-creed-iii-screenshot.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Assassin’s Creed III_ features new gameplay elements such as hunting and dual\nwielding of weaponry. Here the protagonist Connor uses two weapons, a tomahawk\nand a flintlock pistol, against a group of\n[redcoats](/wiki/Red_coat_\\(British_army\\) \"Red coat \\(British army\\)\").\n\n_Assassin 's Creed III_ is a third-person action-adventure title set in an\nopen world in which the player uses a combination of stealth, parkour, and\ncombat to complete various missions. The player takes the role of three\ncharacters during the course of the game. The main character is Desmond Miles,\na 21st-century Assassin, working to uncover the secrets of a mysterious\nPrecursor Vault that will protect the Earth from an upcoming solar flare on\n[December 21, 2012](/wiki/2012_phenomenon \"2012 phenomenon\"). To uncover the\nsecrets, Desmond uses the Animus to live out memories of two of his ancestors\nwhich the player controls during these sequences, both set at the time of the\n[American Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American\nRevolutionary War\"). The first, briefly played at the start of the game, is\nHaytham Kenway, a British Templar who seeks the location of the Vault. The\nsecond, and the primary character for the game, is Ratonhnhaké:ton, the result\nof a brief liaison between Kenway and a Native American woman. Ratonhnhaké:ton\ntakes on the name Connor to blend in better with colonial society. When\nplaying as Connor, the player has access to a huge wilderness known as the\nFrontier (which is 1.5 times bigger than [Rome](/wiki/Rome \"Rome\") in\n_[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Brotherhood\n\"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\")_), the cities of [Boston](/wiki/Boston\n\"Boston\") and [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"). Portions\nof the [Eastern Seaboard](/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States \"East Coast of\nthe United States\") and [Caribbean Sea](/wiki/Caribbean_Sea \"Caribbean Sea\")\ncan be explored via the flagship of the Assassins' navy, the _Aquila_ ,\ncaptained by Connor Kenway himself, with Robert Faulkner his first-mate\nadvising and teaching him in the ways of the sea.\n\n[Free running](/wiki/Free_running \"Free running\") has been simplified to allow\nfor more fluid [parkour](/wiki/Parkour \"Parkour\") in the cities and\nwilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, mountains, cliffs, etc.\nClose combat has been modified, allowing Connor to dual-wield weapons and take\ndown multiple opponents at once and players no longer need to manage the lock-\non mechanic. Aiding this, Connor has access to a wide range of weapons which\ninclude muskets, swords, pistols, native weapons such as the tomahawk and bow\nand arrow, a rope dart (used to pull foes or hang them, while on a tree) as\nwell as the Hidden Blades. In addition, the left Hidden Blade has a folding\nmechanism for blocking attacks, skinning an animal, and performing high-\nprofile assassinations. Human shields can be used against firing lines of\nenemies. Medicine is no longer used as health recovers automatically. Stealth\nis also revamped, allowing players to use natural elements such as tall grass\nand trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people.\n\n_Assassin 's Creed III_ features new weather simulations such as\n[snow](/wiki/Snow \"Snow\"), [fog](/wiki/Fog \"Fog\"), and [rain](/wiki/Rain\n\"Rain\"). The seasons can also change i.e., Summer and Winter, which not only\naffect visuals but also gameplay, as the player will find that they run slower\nin deep snow. Snowfall can reduce visibility for the player and enemies,\naiding stealth. Unlike the past games, this one includes animals varying from\ndomestic (horses, cows, dogs) to wild (deer, wolves, bears). The wild ones are\nfound in the Frontier, and can be hunted for meat or marrow in order to be\nsold. The quality of the kill determines the price, encouraging the player to\nhunt silently. For this, traps and bait can also be used.\n\nEconomy is now based on the Davenport Homestead, which also acts as Connor's\nadoptive home. The site can be visited by people such as carpenters, tailors\netc. suffering from displacement due to the war. Helping and interacting with\nthese [non-player characters](/wiki/Non-player_character \"Non-player\ncharacter\") (NPCs) will encourage them to settle in the Homestead. From there\non, the player can craft various items and trade with them, and then sell the\ngoods to the cities via caravan. The player can also help them build\nrelationships with each other, which will then result in the formation of a\nsmall village. The player can also upgrade the Homestead manor as well as\nConnor's ship, the Aquila.\n\nA revamped version of _[Assassin's Creed:\nBrotherhood](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Brotherhood \"Assassin's Creed:\nBrotherhood\")_'s recruitment feature returns as players can enlist citizens to\nthe Assassins' cause by completing \"Liberation\" missions. They also have a\nmuch larger skill set, which allows them to start a riot, provide a covert\nescort, act as a personal bodyguard etc. Other side missions include\ncollecting Almanac pages, exploring underground tunnels to locate fast-travel\nstations, joining hunting and fighting clubs, investigating frontiersman\nrumors about [UFOs](/wiki/UFO \"UFO\") and [Sasquatch](/wiki/Sasquatch\n\"Sasquatch\"), \"peg-leg\" missions in which Connor goes to underground forts and\nwastelands to uncover the legend of [Captain Kidd](/wiki/William_Kidd \"William\nKidd\")'s treasure, and others.\n\n_Assassin 's Creed III_ also features naval expeditions. Using Connor's\nwarship, the _Aquila_ , the player can navigate the high seas. Control of the\nship relies on environmental factors such as wind direction and speed, local\npresence of storms, high waves, and rocks. Engagements are by cannon, with\n[broadsides](/wiki/Broadside \"Broadside\") covering both flanks of the ship,\n[swivel guns](/wiki/Swivel_gun \"Swivel gun\") that can be used to damage\nsmaller ships which can also be boarded to find treasure, and chain shots from\nthe broadsides as well to take down the masts of larger ships and disable\nthem. The _Aquila_ is used in the side missions known as\n\"[Privateer](/wiki/Privateer \"Privateer\") missions\" and is also used in some\nof the main missions.\n\nThe [Wii U](/wiki/Wii_U \"Wii U\") version of the game has extra features. The\nplayer has the ability to change weapons on the go and the map is always\nvisible on the [Wii U Gamepad](/wiki/Wii_U_Gamepad \"Wii U Gamepad\"). The Wii U\nversion also supports [Off TV Play](/wiki/Off_TV_Play \"Off TV Play\"). With\nthis feature enabled, the main screen is redirected to the Wii U Gamepad.\n\nOnline multiplayer returns in this installment by Ubisoft Annecy. Along with\nreturning modes, new ones feature a co-operative mode named Wolfpack, in which\n1–4 players are charged with killing certain NPCs within a time limit, through\na sequence of 25 stages. It also features Domination, a team mode where\nplayers will have to capture certain areas of the map, protecting them from\nthe opposing team.\n\n##\nSynopsis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Assassin%27s_Creed_III&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Synopsis\")]\n\n###\nSetting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Assassin%27s_Creed_III&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Setting\")]\n\nFollowing the events of _Assassin 's Creed: Revelations_, the game explores\nthe life of an 18th-century assassin in [Colonial\nAmerica](/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States \"Colonial history of the\nUnited States\") during the [American Revolution](/wiki/American_Revolution\n\"American Revolution\"); a half-English, half-[Mohawk](/wiki/Mohawk_Nation\n\"Mohawk Nation\") man named Ratonhnhaké:ton, also known as Connor,[11] whose\nfather is Grand Master of the Templar Order in the colonies. Connor is caught\nup in the Assassins' conflict with the Templar order when his Native American\nvillage is attacked by the Templars, who intend to seize control of the newly\nforming country.\n\nConnor's story spans through two decades of his life. From his childhood in\n1760 to 1783.[12] [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\") and [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") are cities that can be\nexplored,[13] as well as the American Colonial Frontier, spanning forest,\ncliffs, rivers, Connor's [Mohawk](/wiki/Mohawk_people \"Mohawk people\")\nvillage, and the settlements of [Lexington](/wiki/Lexington,_Massachusetts\n\"Lexington, Massachusetts\"), and [Concord](/wiki/Concord,_Massachusetts\n\"Concord, Massachusetts\"). The player can hunt small and large animals, and\napproximately one third of the story takes place in the Frontier.[14] The city\nof [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\") can also be visited at\none point during the game, as can [The Caribbean](/wiki/The_Caribbean \"The\nCaribbean\") during several naval missions.[15] The entire Eastern seaboard is\nalso explorable via Connor's captaining his naval warship, the _Aquila_.[2]\n\n###\nCharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Assassin%27s_Creed_III&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Characters\")]\n\n_Assassin 's Creed III_ features a large cast of characters. The main\ncharacter is Ratonhnhaké:ton ([Noah Watts](/wiki/Noah_Watts \"Noah Watts\")),\nalso known as Connor, an 18th-century assassin.\n\nThe 18th century characters include Achilles Davenport ([Roger Aaron\nBrown](/wiki/Roger_Aaron_Brown \"Roger Aaron Brown\")), Connor's mentor and a\nretired assassin; Connor's mother Kaniehtí:io or Ziio ([Kaniehtiio\nHorn](/wiki/Kaniehtiio_Horn \"Kaniehtiio Horn\")); Connor's first mate aboard\nthe _Aquila_ Robert Faulkner ([Kevin McNally](/wiki/Kevin_McNally \"Kevin\nMcNally\")); and the French taverner Stephane Chapheau (Shawn Baichoo). The\nColonial Templars are led by Connor's father, the English nobleman [Haytham\nKenway](/wiki/Haytham_Kenway \"Haytham Kenway\") (Adrian Hough). He is aided by\nseveral historical figures who are portrayed as members of the Templar order\nincluding [Charles Lee](/wiki/Charles_Lee_\\(general\\) \"Charles Lee\n\\(general\\)\") (Neil Napier), [Thomas Hickey](/wiki/Thomas_Hickey_\\(soldier\\)\n\"Thomas Hickey \\(soldier\\)\") ([Allen Leech](/wiki/Allen_Leech \"Allen Leech\")),\n[John Pitcairn](/wiki/John_Pitcairn \"John Pitcairn\") ([Robert\nLawrenson](/wiki/Robert_Lawrenson \"Robert Lawrenson\")), [Benjamin\nChurch](/wiki/Benjamin_Church_\\(physician\\) \"Benjamin Church \\(physician\\)\")\n([Harry Standjofski](/wiki/Harry_Standjofski \"Harry Standjofski\")), [William\nJohnson](/wiki/Sir_William_Johnson,_1st_Baronet \"Sir William Johnson, 1st\nBaronet\") (Julian Casey), and [Nicholas\nBiddle](/wiki/Nicholas_Biddle_\\(naval_officer\\) \"Nicholas Biddle \\(naval\nofficer\\)\"). The era also features several other historical figures such as\n[Israel Putnam](/wiki/Israel_Putnam \"Israel Putnam\") (Andreas Apergis),\n[George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\") ([Robin Atkin\nDownes](/wiki/Robin_Atkin_Downes \"Robin Atkin Downes\")), [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") (John Emmet Tracy),\n[Mason Weems](/wiki/Parson_Weems \"Parson Weems\") ([Tod\nFennell](/wiki/Tod_Fennell \"Tod Fennell\")), [Paul Revere](/wiki/Paul_Revere\n\"Paul Revere\") (Bruce Dinsmore), [Edward Braddock](/wiki/Edward_Braddock\n\"Edward Braddock\"), [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin\nFranklin\") (Rick Jones), and [Samuel Adams](/wiki/Samuel_Adams \"Samuel Adams\")\n([Mark Lindsay Chapman](/wiki/Mark_Lindsay_Chapman \"Mark Lindsay Chapman\")).\n\nOther characters include Minerva ([Margaret Easley](/wiki/Margaret_Easley\n\"Margaret Easley\")) and Juno (Nadia Verrucci), members of Those Who Came\nBefore; and the Grand Master of the 18th century Templar Order in England,\nReginald Birch ([Gideon Emery](/wiki/Gideon_Emery \"Gideon Emery\")).\n\n###\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Assassin%27s_Creed_III&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nImmediately after the events of [the previous\ngame](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Revelations \"Assassin's Creed: Revelations\"),\nassassin Desmond Miles, his father William, with allies Rebecca Crane and\nShaun Hastings find the Temple of the First Civilization in a cave in [New\nYork](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New York \\(state\\)\") and access it using their\nApple of Eden, an ancient artifact of immense power. After partially\nactivating the temple, Juno uses it to communicate with Desmond. Desmond is\nplaced in the Animus where Juno's influence causes him to experience the life\nof his ancestor in 1754 England: the Templar Grand Master, Haytham Kenway.\n\nHaytham assassinates a patron at the [Royal Opera\nHouse](/wiki/Royal_Opera_House \"Royal Opera House\") and steals a medallion;\nthe Key to the Temple's inner chamber. Haytham is dispatched to the [American\nColonies](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies \"Thirteen Colonies\") to locate the Temple.\nWhile in Boston, he kills a slave trader, freeing a group of Mohawks including\na woman named Kaniehti:io, who asks Haytham to refer to her as Ziio after he\nproves unable to pronounce her full name. She helps Haytham find the Temple in\nexchange for him killing [General Braddock](/wiki/Edward_Braddock \"Edward\nBraddock\"). Haytham and Ziio find that the Key is not able to open the temple\nitself. The pair develop a romantic relationship during their time together,\nwhich results in a son, Ratonhnhaké:ton. The perspective then shifts to\nRatonhnhaké:ton's childhood in 1760. His mother dies during an attack on his\nvillage which Ratonhnhaké:ton believes was led by the Templar [Charles\nLee](/wiki/Charles_Lee_\\(general\\) \"Charles Lee \\(general\\)\"). Years later,\nthe village Elder informs a teenage Ratonhnhaké:ton that their tribe's duty is\nto prevent the Temple's discovery. The Elder gives him a transparent Sphere\nwhich allows Juno to communicate with him; she tells him of his importance and\nshows him the Assassins' symbol. The symbol leads him to the retired Assassin\nAchilles Davenport, who reluctantly begins training him as an assassin.\n\nAchilles suggests Ratonhnhaké:ton rename himself \"Connor\" to enable him to\nmove more freely throughout the Colonies, in fear that some colonists might\nreject him as a tribe member. While seeking supplies in Boston, Connor is\nframed by the Templars for instigating the [Boston\nMassacre](/wiki/Boston_Massacre \"Boston Massacre\"). Over the following years,\nConnor kills several Templars, and aids in the Revolutionary War between the\nPatriots and the British. Connor meets with his father, and the two forge a\ntemporary alliance to eliminate a rogue Templar. Later, Haytham uncovers a\nletter detailing [George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George\nWashington\")'s plan to remove the Indigenous population, including Connor's\ntribe, from the frontier to prevent them supporting [the\nLoyalists](/wiki/Loyalist_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Loyalist \\(American\nRevolution\\)\"). Connor returns to his village and learns that Lee has\nrecruited several Mohawk warriors to turn back the Patriots sent to eradicate\nthem. Connor neutralizes the warriors to avoid conflict, but his childhood\nfriend Kanen'tó:kon cannot be reasoned with and Connor is forced to kill him.\n\nMeanwhile, Desmond is occasionally roused from the Animus to retrieve power\ncells from Manhattan and Brazil, necessary for activating the Temple, before\nthe Templar Daniel Cross can take them. William goes after the final cell\nhimself, but is captured by the Templars' modern day front, Abstergo. Desmond\nassaults the facility, kills Cross and [Warren Vidic](/wiki/Warren_Vidic\n\"Warren Vidic\"), and rescues his father.\n\nConnor becomes conflicted about eliminating the Templars, and hopes to work\nwith Haytham towards a common vision of peace and freedom. However, Haytham\nremains convinced of the chaos of freedom and the necessity to control the\nnation by replacing Washington with Lee. Lee is disgraced by Washington for\nattempting to sabotage the outcome of the [Battle of\nMonmouth](/wiki/Battle_of_Monmouth \"Battle of Monmouth\") and takes refuge in\nthe heavily fortified [Fort George](/wiki/Fort_George,_New_York \"Fort George,\nNew York\"). Connor infiltrates the fort and is confronted by Haytham; they\nduel, and Connor kills him. Connor later kills Lee and recovers the Key. With\nthe Colonial Templars eliminated, Connor returns to his village only to find\nit empty, and the Sphere left behind. Using it, Juno instructs him to conceal\nthe Key where it cannot be found; Connor buries the Key in the grave of\nAchilles' son, Connor Davenport.\n\nIn 2012, Desmond retrieves the Key and accesses the Temple's inner chambers.\nJuno informs him that activating the pedestal will save the world, but at the\ncost of his life. Minerva appears before them, opposing the plan as it will\nfree Juno, who was sealed away in the temple to prevent her conquering\nhumanity. Juno and Minerva explain that if the [solar flare](/wiki/Solar_flare\n\"Solar flare\") occurs, Desmond will be one of the few survivors in a post-\napocalyptic world. After Desmond's later death, he will become revered as a\ngod, whose well-intended legacy will be manipulated to control future\ngenerations, restarting the cycle. Desmond chooses to sacrifice himself in\norder to save humanity and give them the opportunity to fight Juno rather than\nbe destroyed. William, Shaun, and Rebecca leave the temple as Desmond\nactivates the pedestal; a global aurora protects the planet from the solar\neruption. Juno commends Desmond's choice and declares that it is time for her\npart to begin.\n\nIn an epilogue, Connor takes down the Templar portraits in the Davenport\nManor's basement and burns them, signifying the end of his journey. In\naddition, his return to his village is detailed further, showing he spoke to a\nhunter there, who revealed that the land had been sold to settlers in order to\nsettle the new United States government's war debts. Connor also travels to\nthe pier in New York, where he witnesses the last of the British Regulars\nleave America for good.

According to the developers, _Brotherhood_ was not _Assassin 's Creed\nIII_, and the third installment would not star a \"pre-existing\ncharacter.\"[18][19] Ubisoft Montreal's developers stated in their interviews\nthat _Assassin 's Creed III_ would be released eventually.\n\nJean-François Boivin of Ubisoft also stated that each numbered title in the\nseries will introduce a new lead character and a new setting.[20] Patrice\nDésilets, former series' creative director, said that the series has always\nbeen planned as a trilogy. He also commented on the story of _Assassin 's\nCreed III_, saying that it would focus on Assassins' quest to prevent the end\nof the world in 2012, and their race against time to find temples and Apples\nof Eden built by \"Those Who Came Before\". Desmond would be searching for clues\nas to the locations of these temples, by exploring memories of one (or more)\nof his other ancestors.[21]\n\nIn October 2011 Alexandre Amacio, creative director of _[Assassin's Creed:\nRevelations](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Revelations \"Assassin's Creed:\nRevelations\")_, announced that the next installment of the franchise was to be\nreleased before December 2012, however, Amacio himself would not be directing\nthe game.[22] This comes from the idea that Desmond Miles, the modern day\nprotagonist of the series, was to finish his tale by December 2012. Amacio\nsaid that gamers should not have to play a futuristic game after the time\nperiod in which it is set.[23]\n\n### Pre-\nannouncement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Assassin%27s_Creed_III&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Pre-announcement\")]\n\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed during an earnings call on November 8,\n2011, that a new \"major\" _Assassin 's Creed_ game would be released in 2012.\nGuillemot refused to go into any further detail on the title beyond its\nconfirmation.[24] Speaking to MCV, Guillemot dismissed the notion that annual\n_Assassin 's Creed_ installments are diluting the brands, stating instead that\nthey're necessary to \"satisfy the demand\". Guillemot also claimed in the same\ninterview that this year's _Assassin 's Creed_ will be the series' \"biggest to\ndate.\"[25]\n\nIn February 2012, Ubisoft officially confirmed the existence of _Assassin 's\nCreed III_, and its North American release date of October 30, 2012.[26]\nGuillemot described _Assassin 's Creed III_ as \"the true next generation of\nboth the _Assassin 's Creed_ brand and interactive entertainment/storytelling\nin general. We will push the title a lot because it's a fantastic product that\nthe team has been working on for three years. What we have seen is just\nfabulous.\"[26][27] Guillemot went on to say the publisher's investing more\nheavily in the game than in any other title in the series.[27]\n\n#### Internal\nleaks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Assassin%27s_Creed_III&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Internal leaks\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/AC3_canoe_-\n_a_lost_feature.jpeg/220px-AC3_canoe_-\n_a_lost_feature.jpeg)](/wiki/File:AC3_canoe_-_a_lost_feature.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AC3_canoe_-_a_lost_feature.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn early screenshot of _Assassin 's Creed III_ showed Connor paddling a canoe.\nHowever, the feature was removed from the final version.\n\nReports that _Assassin 's Creed III_ would take place during the American\nRevolution surfaced following a supposed \"inside source\" at Ubisoft, who made\nsuch a claim in January 2012.[28] On February 29, 2012, an upcoming\npromotional image of the game was sent to [Kotaku](/wiki/Kotaku \"Kotaku\") by a\n[Best Buy](/wiki/Best_Buy \"Best Buy\") employee, along with information from\nthe retailer that a full reveal was imminent.[29] The leaked promotional image\nled to a general consensus that the game was set in North America during the\nAmerican Revolution, and at least in part, a snowy setting.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Around\nthe same time, Ubisoft mentioned \"a major announcement from Assassin's Creed\"\nwas \"only days away\" via the series' official Facebook. The page's cover photo\nalso depicted a snowy and bleak setting.[29] Furthermore, _[Game\nInformer](/wiki/Game_Informer \"Game Informer\")_ appeared ready to confirm the\nfresh details via an advertising banner posted on its site. Images showed the\nnew assassin standing next to American revolutionary leader [George\nWashington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\").[29]\n\nFollowing the reports, Ubisoft released _Assassin 's Creed III_'s official box\nart on March 1, 2012, which confirmed the game's American Revolution\nsetting.[30] The company said it will announce \"all the details\" at 5pm on\nMarch 5.[31] Additionally, _Game Informer_ revealed its latest cover feature,\nwhich included more artwork of the game's new main character.[32] On March 2,\nseveral screenshots were leaked ahead of Ubisoft's official reveal, and the\nfirst gameplay details emerged via _Game Informer_.[33]\n\n### Post-\nannouncement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Assassin%27s_Creed_III&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Post-announcement\")]\n\n_Assassin 's Creed III_ was unveiled with a cinematic trailer on March 5,\n2012. Ubisoft described the game as the \"most ambitious\" project in the\ncompany's history, with twice the production capacity of any previous title\nfrom the publisher. The game's engine, AnvilNext, delivers improved visuals,\ncharacter models and AI, allowing for battlefields full of fighters.[5]\nUbisoft later said it's aiming to make _Assassin 's Creed III_ \"look next-gen\"\non current-gen consoles using the new AnvilNext engine.[34]\n\nUbisoft said that when Rockstar's _[Red Dead\nRedemption](/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption \"Red Dead Redemption\")_ released midway\nthrough _Assassin 's Creed III_'s development, it was surprised to see\nRockstar had included wild animal hunting and a giant frontier to\nexplore—features both planned for its own sequel. Lead writer Corey May said\nUbisoft's now looking at _Red Dead_ 's success and trying to take the formula\nin \"new directions\". Similarities between these two games are down to \"a\nconvergence of minds\", said _Assassin 's Creed III_ writer Matt Turner.[35]\nCreative Director [Alex\nHutchinson](/wiki/Alex_Hutchinson_\\(video_game_director\\) \"Alex Hutchinson\n\\(video game director\\)\") said Ubisoft steered clear of making the _Assassin\n's Creed III_ protagonist a female character because the game's setting is not\na strong match. Hutchinson said while many people wanted to see female\nassassins in the series, the American Revolution setting makes it difficult\nthis time round.[36]\n\nUbisoft recommends the PC version of the game to be played with a controller\neven though it will still support keyboard and mouse setup. Ubisoft Montreal's\ncreative director Alex Hutchinson admitted: \"We're definitely supporting PC,\nwe love PC, but I think it'll be PC with a controller. I don't see us\ninvesting hugely in a mouse and keyboard setup. I think if you want to play on\nPC and you want to play Assassin's Creed, you have a controller.\"[37]\n\n##\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Assassin%27s_Creed_III&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\nThe score to _Assassin 's Creed III_ was composed by Scottish composer [Lorne\nBalfe](/wiki/Lorne_Balfe \"Lorne Balfe\"), who previously co-composed the\nsoundtrack of _[Assassin's Creed:\nRevelations](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Revelations \"Assassin's Creed:\nRevelations\")_ with longtime _[Assassin's Creed](/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed\n\"Assassin's Creed\")_ series composer, [Jesper Kyd](/wiki/Jesper_Kyd \"Jesper\nKyd\").

The survey asked participants how they\nwould feel about a return of Desmond, Connor and the American Revolution\nsetting, and if they would purchase such a title if it were to be released\nnext year, suggesting that Ubisoft had its eye on repeating the _Brotherhood_\nand _Revelations_ route of the Ezio trilogy. The survey was also said to ask\nhow participants would feel about the introduction of a co-op mode, and how\nthey feel about Naughty Dog's _Uncharted 3: Drake 's Deception_, possibly\nsuggesting a move to more scripted gameplay.[125][126]\n\nOn February 28, 2013, Ubisoft posted their first promotional picture and cover\nfor their next _Assassin 's Creed_ game, following leaked marketing material\ndays before.[127] Titled _Assassin 's Creed IV: Black Flag_, it serves as a\nsequel to _Assassin 's Creed III_'s modern story and a prequel to its\nancestral storyline.
