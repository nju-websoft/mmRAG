It was used in such applications as\n[electrical insulation](/wiki/Electrical_insulation \"Electrical insulation\")\nfor hotplate wiring and in [building insulation](/wiki/Building_insulation\n\"Building insulation\"). When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or\nheat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats.\nThese desirable properties made asbestos very widely used. Asbestos use\ncontinued to grow through most of the 20th century until public knowledge\n(acting through courts and legislatures) of the health hazards of asbestos\ndust outlawed asbestos in mainstream construction and\n[fireproofing](/wiki/Fireproofing \"Fireproofing\") in most countries.\n\n[Inhalation](/wiki/Inhalation \"Inhalation\") of asbestos fibers can cause\nserious and fatal illnesses including [lung cancer](/wiki/Lung_cancer \"Lung\ncancer\"), [mesothelioma](/wiki/Mesothelioma \"Mesothelioma\"), and\n[asbestosis](/wiki/Asbestosis \"Asbestosis\") (a type of\n[pneumoconiosis](/wiki/Pneumoconiosis \"Pneumoconiosis\")).[4][5] Concern of\nasbestos-related illness in modern times began with the 20th century and\nescalated during the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1980s and 1990s, asbestos trade\nand use were heavily restricted, phased out, or banned outright in an\nincreasing number of countries.[6]\n\nDespite the severity of asbestos-related diseases, the material has extremely\nwidespread use in many areas.

Crocidolite is\nseen under a microscope as a blue fiber.\n\n[Crocidolite](/wiki/Crocidolite \"Crocidolite\") commonly occurs as soft\n[friable](/wiki/Friability \"Friability\") fibers. Asbestiform amphibole may\nalso occur as soft friable fibers but some varieties such as amosite are\ncommonly straighter. All forms of asbestos are fibrillar in that they are\ncomposed of fibers with breadths less than 1 [micrometer](/wiki/Micrometre\n\"Micrometre\") in bundles of very great widths.

For example, according to\n[Tabari](/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Jarir_al-Tabari \"Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari\"),\none of the curious items belonging to [Khosrow II](/wiki/Khosrow_II \"Khosrow\nII\") Parviz, the great [Sassanian](/wiki/Sassanian \"Sassanian\") king (r.\n531–579), was a napkin ([Persian](/wiki/Persian_language \"Persian language\"):\nمنديل‎) that he cleaned simply by throwing it into fire. Such cloth is\nbelieved to have been made of asbestos imported over the [Hindu\nKush](/wiki/Hindu_Kush \"Hindu Kush\").[23] According to\n[Biruni](/wiki/Biruni#ref-16 \"Biruni\") in his book, _Gems_ , any cloths made\nof asbestos ([Persian](/wiki/Persian_language \"Persian language\"): آذرشست‎,\n_āzarshost_) were called _shostakeh_ ([Persian](/wiki/Persian_language\n\"Persian language\"): شستكه‎).[24] Some Persians believed the fiber was the fur\nof an animal, called the _[samandar](/wiki/Salamander_\\(legendary_creature\\)\n\"Salamander \\(legendary creature\\)\")_ ([Persian](/wiki/Persian_language\n\"Persian language\"): سمندر‎), which lived in fire and died when exposed to\nwater,[25][26] which was where the former belief that the\n[salamander](/wiki/Salamander \"Salamander\") could tolerate fire\noriginated.[27]\n\n[Charlemagne](/wiki/Charlemagne \"Charlemagne\"), the first [Holy Roman\nEmperor](/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Holy Roman Emperor\") (800–814), is said to\nhave had a tablecloth made of asbestos.[28]\n\n[Marco Polo](/wiki/Marco_Polo \"Marco Polo\") recounts having been shown, in a\nplace he calls _Ghinghin talas_ , \"a good vein from which the cloth which we\ncall of salamander, which cannot be burnt if it is thrown into the fire, is\nmade ...\"[29]\n\nSome archaeologists believe that ancients made shrouds of asbestos, wherein\nthey burned the bodies of their kings, in order to preserve only their ashes,\nand prevent them being mixed with those of wood or other combustible materials\ncommonly used in funeral pyres.[30][31] Others assert that the ancients used\nasbestos to make perpetual wicks for [sepulchral](/wiki/Sepulchre \"Sepulchre\")\nor other lamps.[25] A famous example is the golden lamp _asbestos lychnis_ ,\nwhich the sculptor [Callimachus](/wiki/Callimachus_\\(sculptor\\) \"Callimachus\n\\(sculptor\\)\") made for the [Erechtheion](/wiki/Erechtheion\n\"Erechtheion\").[32] In more recent centuries, asbestos was indeed used for\nthis purpose. Although asbestos causes skin to itch upon contact, [ancient\nliterature](/wiki/Ancient_literature \"Ancient literature\") indicates that it\nwas prescribed for diseases of the skin, and particularly for the itch. It is\npossible that they used the term _asbestos_ for [soapstone](/wiki/Soapstone\n\"Soapstone\"), because the two terms have often been confused throughout\nhistory.[30][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\")_]\n\n### Industrial era[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Industrial era\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Asbestos_mining_1876.jpg/220px-\nAsbestos_mining_1876.jpg)](/wiki/File:Asbestos_mining_1876.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Asbestos_mining_1876.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIndustrial scale asbestos mining began in 1878 in [Thetford\ntownship](/wiki/Thetford_Mines \"Thetford Mines\"), [Quebec](/wiki/Quebec\n\"Quebec\"). By 1895, mining was increasingly mechanized.\n\nThe large scale asbestos industry began in the mid-19th century. Early\nattempts at producing asbestos paper and cloth in Italy began in the 1850s,\nbut were unsuccessful in creating a market for such products. Canadian samples\nof asbestos were displayed in London in 1862, and the first companies were\nformed in England and Scotland to exploit this resource. Asbestos was first\nused in the manufacture of yarn, and German industrialist Louis Wertheim\nadopted this process in his factories in Germany. [33] In 1871, the Patent\nAsbestos Manufacturing Company was established in Glasgow, and within the\nfollowing decades, the [Clydebank](/wiki/Clydebank \"Clydebank\") area became a\ncentre for the nascent industry.[34]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Asbestos%2C_Quebec%2C_Canada.jpg/220px-\nAsbestos%2C_Quebec%2C_Canada.jpg)](/wiki/File:Asbestos,_Quebec,_Canada.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Asbestos,_Quebec,_Canada.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCanada's biggest power shovel loading an ore train with asbestos at the\nJeffrey Mine, Johns-Manville Co., Asbestos, Quebec, June 1944.\n\nIndustrial scale mining began in the [Thetford hills](/wiki/Thetford_Mines\n\"Thetford Mines\"), [Quebec](/wiki/Quebec \"Quebec\") from the 1870s.

Mining also took off in\n[South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\") from 1893 under the aegis of\nthe British businessman Francis Oates, the Director of the [De\nBeers](/wiki/De_Beers \"De Beers\") company.[38] It was in South Africa that the\nproduction of amosite began in 1910. The U.S. asbestos industry had an early\nstart in 1858, when fibrous anthophyllite was mined for use as asbestos\ninsulation by the Johns Company, a predecessor to the current Johns Manville,\nat a quarry at Ward's Hill on Staten Island, New York.[39] US production began\nin earnest in 1899, with the discovery of large deposits in the [Belvidere\nMountain](/wiki/Eden,_Vermont#Belvidere_Mountain \"Eden, Vermont\").\n\nThe use of asbestos became increasingly widespread towards the end of the 19th\ncentury, when its diverse applications included fire retardant coatings,\nconcrete, bricks, pipes and fireplace cement, heat, fire, and acid resistant\ngaskets, pipe insulation, ceiling insulation, fireproof drywall, flooring,\nroofing, lawn furniture, and drywall joint compound. In 2011 it was reported\nthat over 50% of UK houses still contained asbestos, despite a ban on asbestos\nproducts some years earlier.[40]\n\nIn Japan, particularly after [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War\nII\"), asbestos was used in the manufacture of [ammonium\nsulfate](/wiki/Ammonium_sulfate \"Ammonium sulfate\") for purposes of rice\nproduction, sprayed upon the ceilings, iron skeletons, and walls of railroad\ncars and buildings (during the 1960s), and used for energy efficiency reasons\nas well. Production of asbestos in Japan peaked in 1974 and went through ups\nand downs until about 1990, when production began to drop dramatically.[41]\n\n### Discovery of\ntoxicity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Discovery of toxicity\")]\n\nFor additional chronological citations, see [List of asbestos disease medical\narticles](/wiki/List_of_asbestos_disease_medical_articles \"List of asbestos\ndisease medical articles\").\n\nIn 1899, Montague Murray noted the negative health effects of asbestos.[42]\nThe first documented death related to asbestos was in 1906.[43]\n\nIn the early 1900s researchers began to notice a large number of early deaths\nand lung problems in asbestos-mining towns. The first such study was conducted\nby H. Montague Murray at the [Charing Cross\nHospital](/wiki/Charing_Cross_Hospital \"Charing Cross Hospital\"),\n[London](/wiki/London \"London\"), in 1900, in which a postmortem investigation\nof a young man who had died from [pulmonary fibrosis](/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis\n\"Pulmonary fibrosis\") after having worked for 14 years in an asbestos textile\nfactory, discovered asbestos traces in the victim's lungs. [Adelaide\nAnderson](/wiki/Adelaide_Anderson \"Adelaide Anderson\"), the Inspector of\nFactories in Britain, included asbestos in a list of harmful industrial\nsubstances in 1902. Similar investigations were conducted in France and Italy,\nin 1906 and 1908, respectively.[44]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Heat-\nresistant_asbestos_fabric.jpg/220px-Heat-\nresistant_asbestos_fabric.jpg)](/wiki/File:Heat-resistant_asbestos_fabric.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Heat-resistant_asbestos_fabric.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAsbestos fabric\n\nThe first diagnosis of asbestosis was made in the UK in 1924.[43][45][46]\n[Nellie Kershaw](/wiki/Nellie_Kershaw \"Nellie Kershaw\") was employed at\n[Turner Brothers Asbestos](/wiki/Turner_%26_Newall \"Turner & Newall\") in\n[Manchester](/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\"), [England](/wiki/England\n\"England\") from 1917, spinning raw asbestos fibre into yarn.[46][47] Her death\nin 1924 led to a formal inquest. [Pathologist](/wiki/Pathology \"Pathology\")\nWilliam Edmund Cooke testified that his examination of the lungs indicated old\nscarring indicative of a previous, healed, tuberculosis infection, and\nextensive [fibrosis](/wiki/Fibrosis \"Fibrosis\"), in which were visible\n\"particles of mineral matter ... of various shapes, but the large majority\nhave sharp angles.\"[45] Having compared these particles with samples of\nasbestos dust provided by S. A. Henry, His Majesty's Medical Inspector of\nFactories, Cooke concluded that they \"originated from asbestos and were,\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, the primary cause of the fibrosis of the lungs and\ntherefore of death\".[46][48]\n\nAs a result of Cooke's paper,\n[parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Parliament of the United\nKingdom\") commissioned an inquiry into the effects of asbestos dust by E. R.\nA. Merewether, Medical Inspector of Factories, and C. W. Price, a [factory\ninspector](/wiki/History_of_labour_law_in_the_United_Kingdom#Factory_and_Workshop_Act_1901\n\"History of labour law in the United Kingdom\") and pioneer of dust monitoring\nand control.[2] Their subsequent report, _Occurrence of Pulmonary Fibrosis &\nOther Pulmonary Affections in Asbestos Workers_, was presented to parliament\non 24 March 1930.[49] It concluded that the development of asbestosis was\nirrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of asbestos dust, and included\nthe first health study of asbestos workers, which found that 66% of those\nemployed for 20 years or more suffered from asbestosis.[2] The report led to\nthe publication of the first Asbestos Industry Regulations in 1931, which came\ninto effect on 1 March 1932.[50] These regulated ventilation and made\n[asbestosis](/wiki/Asbestosis \"Asbestosis\") an excusable work-related\ndisease.[12] The term [mesothelioma](/wiki/Mesothelioma \"Mesothelioma\") was\nfirst used in medical literature in 1931; its association with asbestos was\nfirst noted sometime in the 1940s. Similar legislation followed in the U.S.\nabout ten years later.\n\nApproximately 100,000 people in the United States have died, or are terminally\nill, from asbestos exposure related to ship building. In the [Hampton\nRoads](/wiki/Hampton_Roads \"Hampton Roads\") area, a shipbuilding center,\nmesothelioma occurrence is seven times the national rate.[51] Thousands of\ntons of asbestos were used in World War II ships to insulate piping, boilers,\nsteam engines, and steam turbines. There were approximately 4.3 million\nshipyard workers in the United States during WWII; for every 1,000 workers\nabout 14 died of mesothelioma and an unknown number died from asbestosis.[52]\n\nThe United States government and asbestos industry have been criticized for\nnot acting quickly enough to inform the public of dangers, and to reduce\npublic exposure. In the late 1970s, court documents proved that asbestos\nindustry officials knew of asbestos dangers since the 1930s and had concealed\nthem from the public.[52]\n\nIn Australia, asbestos was widely used in construction and other industries\nbetween 1946 and 1980. From the 1970s there was increasing concern about the\ndangers of asbestos, and its use was phased out. Mining ceased in 1983. The\nuse of asbestos was phased out in 1989 and banned entirely in December 2003.\nThe dangers of asbestos are now well known in Australia and there is help and\nsupport for sufferers from asbestosis or mesothelioma.[53]\n\n### Usage by industry and product\ntype[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section:\nUsage by industry and product type\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-\nnew.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg)|\nThis section **needs additional citations\nfor[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.\nPlease help [improve this\narticle](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&action=edit) by [adding\ncitations to reliable\nsources](/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing_with_Wiki_Markup/1\n\"Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1\").

A notable\nexception is the United States, where asbestos continues to be used in\nconstruction such as cement asbestos pipes. The 5th Circuit Court prevented\nthe EPA from banning asbestos in 1991 because EPA research showed the ban\nwould cost between $450 and 800 million while only saving around 200 lives in\na 13-year timeframe, and that the EPA did not provide adequate evidence for\nthe safety of alternative products.[60] Until the mid-1980s, small amounts of\nwhite asbestos were used in the manufacture of [Artex](/wiki/Artex \"Artex\"), a\ndecorative stipple finish,[61] however, some of the lesser-known suppliers of\nArtex were still adding white asbestos until 1999.[62]\n\nPrior to the ban, asbestos was widely used in the construction industry in\nthousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due\nto the amount of asbestos and the material's friable nature. Sprayed coatings,\npipe insulation and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most\ndangerous due to their high content of asbestos and friable nature. Many older\nbuildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States,\nthere is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by\n[ASTM](/wiki/ASTM \"ASTM\") Standard E 2356–04.

Renovation and demolition of asbestos-\ncontaminated buildings is subject to EPA [NESHAP](/wiki/NESHAP \"NESHAP\") and\nOSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under\n[CERCLA](/wiki/CERCLA \"CERCLA\")'s innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the\nremoval and disposal of asbestos and of substances containing it are covered\nby the [Control of Asbestos Regulations\n2006](/wiki/Control_of_Asbestos_Regulations_2006 \"Control of Asbestos\nRegulations 2006\").[64]\n\nU.S. asbestos consumption hit a peak of 804,000 tons in 1973; world asbestos\ndemand peaked around 1977, with 25 countries producing nearly 4.8 million\nmetric tons annually.[65]\n\nIn older buildings (e.g. those built prior to 1999 in the UK, before white\nasbestos was banned), asbestos may still be present in some areas. Being aware\nof asbestos locations reduces the risk of disturbing asbestos.[66]\n\nRemoval of asbestos building components can also remove the fire protection\nthey provide, therefore fire protection substitutes are required for proper\nfire protection that the asbestos originally provided.[66][67]\n\n#### Outside Europe and North\nAmerica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: Outside Europe and North America\")]\n\nSome countries, such as [India](/wiki/India \"India\"), Indonesia, China, Russia\nand [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil \"Brazil\"), have continued widespread use of\nasbestos.

In general, people who become ill from\ninhaling asbestos have been regularly exposed in a job where they worked\ndirectly with the material.\n\nThe most common diseases associated with chronic exposure to asbestos are\n[asbestosis](/wiki/Asbestosis \"Asbestosis\") and\n[mesothelioma](/wiki/Mesothelioma \"Mesothelioma\").[102]\n\n## Substitutes for asbestos in\nconstruction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit\nsection: Substitutes for asbestos in construction\")]\n\n[Fiberglass](/wiki/Glass_wool \"Glass wool\") insulation was invented in 1938\nand is now the most commonly used type of [insulation\nmaterial](/wiki/Building_insulation_materials \"Building insulation\nmaterials\"). The safety of this material has also been called into question\ndue to similarities in material structure.[103] However, the [International\nAgency for Research on\nCancer](/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer \"International\nAgency for Research on Cancer\") removed fiberglass from its list of possible\nhuman carcinogens in 2001[104] and a scientific review article from 2011\nclaimed epidemiology data was inconsistent and concluded that the IARC's\ndecision to downgrade the carcinogenic potential of fiberglass was valid\n(however, this study was funded by sponsored research contract from the North\nAmerican Insulation Manufacturer’s Association).[105]\n\nIn 1978, a highly texturized fiberglass fabric was invented by [Bal\nDixit](/wiki/Bal_Dixit \"Bal Dixit\"), called [Zetex](/wiki/Zetex_\\(fabric\\)\n\"Zetex \\(fabric\\)\"). This fabric is lighter than asbestos, but offers the same\nbulk, thickness, hand, feel, and abrasion resistance as asbestos. The\nfiberglass was texturized to eliminate some of the problems that arise with\nfiberglass, such as poor abrasion resistance and poor seam strength.[106]\n\nIn Europe, [mineral wool](/wiki/Mineral_wool \"Mineral wool\") and [glass\nwool](/wiki/Glass_wool \"Glass wool\") are the main insulators in houses.\n\nMany companies that produced asbestos-cement products that were reinforced\nwith asbestos fibers have developed products incorporating organic fibers. One\nsuch product was known as \"[Eternit](/wiki/Eternit \"Eternit\")\" and another\n\"Everite\" now use \"[Nutec](/wiki/Nutec \"Nutec\")\" fibers which consist of\norganic fibers, [portland cement](/wiki/Portland_cement \"Portland cement\") and\n[silica](/wiki/Silica \"Silica\"). [Cement-bonded wood fiber](/wiki/Cement-\nbonded_wood_fiber \"Cement-bonded wood fiber\") is another substitute. Stone\nfibers are used in gaskets and friction materials.\n\nAnother potential fiber is [polybenzimidazole](/wiki/Polybenzimidazole\n\"Polybenzimidazole\") or PBI fiber. [Polybenzimidazole\nfiber](/wiki/Polybenzimidazole_fiber \"Polybenzimidazole fiber\") is a\n[synthetic fiber](/wiki/Synthetic_fiber \"Synthetic fiber\") with a high\n[melting point](/wiki/Melting_point \"Melting point\") of 760 °C (1,400 °F) that\nalso does not ignite. Because of its exceptional thermal and chemical\nstability, it is often used by [fire departments](/wiki/Fire_departments \"Fire\ndepartments\") and [space agencies](/wiki/Space_agencies \"Space agencies\").\n\n## Recycling and\ndisposal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit\nsection: Recycling and disposal\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/AsbestosContainment.JPG/220px-\nAsbestosContainment.JPG)](/wiki/File:AsbestosContainment.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AsbestosContainment.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nOld [Wailuku](/wiki/Wailuku \"Wailuku\") Post Office sealed off for [asbestos\nremoval](/wiki/Asbestos_removal \"Asbestos removal\")\n\nAsbestos alternatives for industrial use include sleeves, rope, tape, fabric,\ntextiles and [insulation batt materials](/wiki/Insulation_batt_materials\n\"Insulation batt materials\") made from [fiberglass](/wiki/Fiberglass\n\"Fiberglass\") and silica.\n\nIn most developed countries, asbestos is typically disposed of as [hazardous\nwaste](/wiki/Hazardous_waste \"Hazardous waste\") in [landfill\nsites](/wiki/Landfill_site \"Landfill site\").\n\nThe [demolition](/wiki/Demolition \"Demolition\") of buildings containing large\namounts of asbestos based materials pose particular problems for builders and\nproperty developers – such buildings often have to be deconstructed piece by\npiece, or the asbestos has to be painstakingly removed before the structure\ncan be razed by mechanical or explosive means. One such example is the [Red\nRoad Flats](/wiki/Red_Road_Flats \"Red Road Flats\") in [Glasgow](/wiki/Glasgow\n\"Glasgow\"), Scotland which used huge amounts of asbestos cement board for wall\npanelling – here British health and safety regulations stipulate that asbestos\nmaterial has to be removed to a landfill site via an approved route at certain\ntimes of the day in specially adapted vehicles.\n\nAsbestos can be recycled by transforming it into harmless [silicate\nglass](/wiki/Silicate_glass \"Silicate glass\"). A process of thermal\ndecomposition at 1000–1250 °C produces a mixture of non-hazardous silicate\nphases, and at temperatures above 1250 °C it produces silicate glass.[107]\nMicrowave thermal treatment can be used in an industrial manufacturing process\nto transform asbestos and asbestos-containing waste into porcelain stoneware\ntiles, porous single-fired wall tiles, and ceramic bricks.[108]\n\nThe combination of [oxalic acid](/wiki/Oxalic_acid \"Oxalic acid\") with\n[ultrasound](/wiki/Ultrasound \"Ultrasound\") fully degrades chrysotile asbestos\nfibers.[109]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&action=edit&section=27 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Asbestine](/wiki/Asbestine \"Asbestine\")\n  * [List of minerals](/wiki/List_of_minerals \"List of minerals\")\n  * [Asbestos abatement](/wiki/Asbestos_abatement \"Asbestos abatement\")\n  * [Asbestos and the law](/wiki/Asbestos_and_the_law \"Asbestos and the law\")\n  * [Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization](/wiki/Asbestos_Disease_Awareness_Organization \"Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization\")\n  * [Asbestos-ceramic](/wiki/Asbestos-ceramic \"Asbestos-ceramic\")\n  * [Asbestos cement](/wiki/Asbestos_cement \"Asbestos cement\")\n  * [Medical geology](/wiki/Medical_geology \"Medical geology\")\n  * [Red List building materials](/wiki/Red_List_building_materials \"Red List building materials\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Asbestos&action=edit&section=28 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ Alleman, James E.; Mossman, Brooke T (July 1997).
