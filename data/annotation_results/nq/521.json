Rudolph is usually depicted as the lead reindeer pulling Santa's\nsleigh on [Christmas Eve](/wiki/Christmas_Eve \"Christmas Eve\"), though he is a\nyoung buck who has only adolescent antlers and a glowing red nose. Though he\nreceives scrutiny for it, the luminosity of his nose is so great that it\nilluminates the team's path through harsh [winter\nweather](/wiki/Winter_weather \"Winter weather\").\n\nRudolph first appeared in a 1939 booklet written by [Robert L.\nMay](/wiki/Robert_L._May \"Robert L. May\") and published by [Montgomery\nWard](/wiki/Montgomery_Ward \"Montgomery Ward\"), the department store.[1][2][3]\n\nThe story is owned by The Rudolph Company, LP and has been adapted in numerous\nforms including [a popular song](/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_\\(song\\)\n\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer \\(song\\)\"), [the iconic 1964 television\nspecial](/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_\\(TV_special\\) \"Rudolph the Red-\nNosed Reindeer \\(TV special\\)\") and sequels, and [a feature\nfilm](/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer:_The_Movie \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed\nReindeer: The Movie\") and sequel. Character Arts, LLC manages the licensing\nfor the Rudolph Company, LP. In many countries, Rudolph has become a figure of\nChristmas [folklore](/wiki/Folklore \"Folklore\"). 2014 marked the 75th\nanniversary of the character[4] and the 50th anniversary of the television\nspecial.[5] A series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the\n[United States Postal Service](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service \"United\nStates Postal Service\") on November 6, 2014.[6][7]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Publication history\n  * 2 The story\n  * 3 In media\n    * 3.1 Theatrical cartoon short (1948)\n    * 3.2 Song (1949)\n    * 3.3 Comic books (beginning in 1950)\n    * 3.4 Children's book (1958)\n    * 3.5 Stop-motion animation television special (1964) and sequels (1976–79)\n    * 3.6 Animated feature-length films\n    * 3.7 Other\n  * 4 Homages in media\n    * 4.1 Film\n    * 4.2 Games\n    * 4.3 Music\n    * 4.4 Television and webisodes\n  * 5 Relatives in different adaptations\n    * 5.1 Parents\n    * 5.2 Offspring\n    * 5.3 Siblings\n    * 5.4 Aunts, uncles, and cousins\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Publication history[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Publication history\")]\n\nRobert L. May created Rudolph in 1939 as an assignment for\n[Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\")-based [Montgomery\nWard](/wiki/Montgomery_Ward \"Montgomery Ward\"). The retailer had been buying\nand giving away [coloring books](/wiki/Coloring_book \"Coloring book\") for\nChristmas every year and it was decided that creating their own book would\nsave money. May considered naming the reindeer \"Rollo\" or \"Reginald\" before\ndeciding upon using the name \"Rudolph.\"[8] In its first year of publication,\nMontgomery Ward distributed 2.4 million copies of Rudolph's story.[9] The\nstory is written as a poem in [anapestic\ntetrameter](/wiki/Anapestic_tetrameter \"Anapestic tetrameter\"), the same meter\nas \"[A Visit from St. Nicholas](/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas \"A Visit from\nSt. Nicholas\")\" (also known as \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nPublication and reprint rights for the book _Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer_\nare controlled by [Pearson PLC](/wiki/Pearson_PLC \"Pearson PLC\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nWhile May was pondering how best to craft a Christmas story about a reindeer,\nwhile staring out his office window in downtown Chicago, a thick fog from\n[Lake Michigan](/wiki/Lake_Michigan \"Lake Michigan\") blocked his view—giving\nhim a flash of inspiration. \"Suddenly I had it!\" he recalled. \"A nose! A\nbright red nose that would shine through fog like a spotlight.\"[10]\n\nThe cultural significance of a red nose has changed since the story's\npublication. In 1930's popular culture, a bright red nose was closely\nassociated with chronic alcoholism and drunkards, so the story idea was\ninitially rejected. May asked his illustrator friend at Montgomery Ward,\nDenver Gillen, to draw \"cute reindeer\", using zoo deer as models. The alert,\nbouncy character Gillen developed convinced management to support the\nidea.[11]\n\nMaxton Books published the first mass-market edition of _Rudolph_ in\n1947[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] and a sequel, _Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Shines Again_ , in\n1954.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] In 1992, Applewood Books published _Rudolph 's Second Christmas_,\nan unpublished sequel that Robert May wrote in 1947.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\n2003, [Penguin Books](/wiki/Penguin_Books \"Penguin Books\") issued a reprint\nversion of the original _Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer_ with new artwork by\nLisa Papp.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Penguin also reprinted May's sequels, _Rudolph\nShines Again_ and _Rudolph 's Second Christmas_ (now retitled _Rudolph to the\nRescue_).[12]\n\n## The story[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: The story\")]\n\nThe story chronicles the experiences of Rudolph, a youthful reindeer buck\n(male) who possesses an unusual luminous red nose. Mocked and excluded by his\npeers because of this trait, Rudolph proves himself one [Christmas\nEve](/wiki/Christmas_Eve \"Christmas Eve\") with poor visibility due to\ninclement weather after [Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus \"Santa Claus\") catches\nsight of Rudolph's nose and asks Rudolph to lead his sleigh for the evening.\nRudolph agrees and is finally favored by his fellow reindeer for his heroism\nand accomplishment.\n\n## In media[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: In media\")]\n\n### Theatrical cartoon short (1948)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Theatrical cartoon short\n\\(1948\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1948\nfilm)](/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_\\(1948_film\\) \"Rudolph the Red-\nNosed Reindeer \\(1948 film\\)\")\n\nRudolph made his first screen appearance in 1948, in a cartoon short produced\nby [Max Fleischer](/wiki/Max_Fleischer \"Max Fleischer\") for the [Jam\nHandy](/wiki/Jam_Handy \"Jam Handy\") Corporation that was more faithful to\nMay's original story than Marks' song, which had not yet been written.[13] It\nwas reissued in 1951 with the song added.[13]\n\n### Song (1949)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Song \\(1949\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)](/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer_\\(song\\) \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer \\(song\\)\")\n\nMay's brother-in-law, [Johnny Marks](/wiki/Johnny_Marks \"Johnny Marks\"),\nadapted the story of Rudolph into a song.

As the producers of the special only had\nthe song as source material and did not have a copy of the original book, they\ninterpolated an original story around the central narrative of the song, one\nthat differed from the book. This re-telling chronicles Rudolph's social\nrejection among his peers and his decision to run away from home. Rudolph is\naccompanied by a similarly outcast elf named Hermey, who skipped elf practice\nto become a dentist, along with a loud, boisterous, eager prospector named\nYukon Cornelius who was in search of wealth. Additional original characters\ninclude Rudolph's love interest, Clarice; the antagonistic \"Abominable Snow\nMonster\"; and, as narrator, the living Sam the Snowman, voiced by [Burl\nIves](/wiki/Burl_Ives \"Burl Ives\").\n\nIn the 1964 stop-motion movie, Rudolph is born to Donder the Reindeer and\nDonder's wife. He is discovered by Santa to have a shiny, glowing red nose.\nDonder, regardless of Rudolph's defect, trains him to be a normal reindeer\nwith skills such as gathering food and hiding from the \"Abominable Snow\nMonster\", a giant, furry white beast. To hide Rudolph's nose, Donder puts dirt\non it to cover it with a black coating. This causes Rudolph to talk in a funny\naccent, as told by the Rudolph's peers. A short time later, Rudolph joins his\npeers at the Reindeer Games, where he meets Fireball, who is initially\nfriendly and has a shock of strawberry blond hair on his head, and Clarice, a\nfemale spectator who takes a liking to Rudolph. Clarice's flirtation inspires\nRudolph to perform better than all of his peers at flying, but in his\nexcitement he knocks the black cover off his nose, revealing a red glow that\ncauses Fireball and the others to turn against him; this distraction, in turn,\nprompts the coach (Comet) to ban Rudolph from the Reindeer Games. Clarice\nremains loyal to him, only to be ordered by her father not to shame the family\nby associating with \"a red-nosed reindeer.\"\n\nRudolph soon runs into Hermey, an elf who was forced out of his job at the\nNorth Pole's toy factory; Hermey showed a total lack of interest in the\ntoymaking and singing aspects of being an elf and instead wanted to pursue\ndentistry. They come to the conclusion that they're both misfits and decide to\nrun away together. On their aimless journey, they run into Yukon Cornelius,\nthe self-described \"greatest prospector of the North\" who nevertheless seems\nto never find any silver or gold, and attempt to stay away from the Bumble, a\nhuge [abominable snow monster](/wiki/Yeti \"Yeti\"). Their journey leads them to\nthe Island of Misfit Toys, where sentient but unorthodox toys go when they are\nabandoned by their owners. King Moonracer, the winged lion that lords over the\nIsland, refuses to let them stay there permanently, instead telling the trio\nto return home and tell Santa Claus of the toys' plight, in exchange for one\nnight's stay on the island. Rudolph refuses the offer and, fearing for his\nfriends' life, runs off alone.\n\nA now older Rudolph, still unable to find a place in the world, returns home\nto the North Pole, only to find that his family and Clarice had left to look\nfor him and are now about to be eaten by the Bumble. With the help of Hermey\nand Yukon (who arrived separately), they lure the Bumble away and pacify him\nby knocking him unconscious and allowing Hermey (with dental skills he has\nacquired by reading books) to remove his sharp teeth. Everyone eventually\nreturns to Santa's workshop, where a dismayed Santa Claus breaks the bad news\nthat the weather is too bad to take the sleigh out and that Christmas would be\ncanceled. Santa changes his mind when he notices Rudolph's red nose and asks\nRudolph to lead the sleigh team, which he happily accepts.\n\nAfter the story's initial broadcast, its closing credits were revised. Images\nof wrapped presents being dropped from Santa's sleigh were replaced by a scene\nin which Santa stops to pick up the Misfit Toys and delivers them to the homes\nof children below, where they were found by children who loved them. The\nchanges were prompted by viewer feedback pleading for a happy ending for each\ntoy. The special now airs annually on CBS, rather than NBC, and is hailed as a\nclassic by many. The special's original assortment of characters have acquired\niconic status, and an uncertainty surrounding an error in the special's\ncopyright has allowed the special to be widely parodied and imitated in the\ndecades since its original airing.\n\nThe sequel _[Rudolph's Shiny New Year](/wiki/Rudolph%27s_Shiny_New_Year\n\"Rudolph's Shiny New Year\")_ (premier air date December 10, 1976) continued\nthe reindeer's journeys, and the series was made into a trilogy with the 1979\nfeature-length film _[Christmas in\nJuly](/wiki/Rudolph_and_Frosty%27s_Christmas_in_July \"Rudolph and Frosty's\nChristmas in July\")_ , which integrated the _Rudolph_ universe into that of\nRankin/Bass's adaptation of _[Frosty the\nSnowman](/wiki/Frosty_the_Snowman_\\(TV_special\\) \"Frosty the Snowman \\(TV\nspecial\\)\")_.\n\n### Animated feature-length films[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Animated feature-length\nfilms\")]\n\nMain article: [Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The\nMovie](/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer:_The_Movie \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed\nReindeer: The Movie\")\n\n_[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie](/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer:_The_Movie \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie\")_ (1998)\nis an animated feature film.

Its inclusion\nof a [villain](/wiki/Villain \"Villain\"), a love interest, a sidekick, and a\nstrong protector are more derivative of the Rankin/Bass adaptation of the\nstory than the original tale and song (the characters of Stormella, Zoey,\nArrow, Slyly, and Leonard parallel the Rankin/Bass characters of the Bumble,\nClarice, Fireball, Hermey, and Yukon, respectively).

In the paper, Dominy noted that reindeer eyes can perceive shorter\nwavelengths of light than humans, allowing them to see ultraviolet light;\nultraviolet light, however, is much more easily scattered in fog, which would\nblind reindeer. Thus, Rudolph's red nose, emitting longer-wavelength red\nlight, would penetrate the fog more easily.

In slow motion, you can clearly count nine reindeer.\n\n### Games[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: Games\")]\n\n  * Rudolph is mentioned in the video game _[Army of Two](/wiki/Army_of_Two \"Army of Two\")_ (2008) during a tutorial video about the use of the game's Aggro feature.\n  * In _[Guild Wars Nightfall](/wiki/Guild_Wars_Nightfall \"Guild Wars Nightfall\")_ (2006), player characters are accompanied by a reindeer named Rudy whose nose begins to glow red when coming into range of presents that the player is tasked to find in a holiday themed quest.\n\n### Music[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Music\")]\n\n  * Rudolph is mentioned in the [Beach Boys](/wiki/The_Beach_Boys \"The Beach Boys\")' song \"[Little Saint Nick](/wiki/Little_Saint_Nick \"Little Saint Nick\")\" (1963) in the following lyric: \"Now haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed with a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead.\"[25]\n  * \"[Run Rudolph Run](/wiki/Run_Rudolph_Run \"Run Rudolph Run\")\" (1958) is a [Christmas song](/wiki/Christmas_song \"Christmas song\") popularized by [Chuck Berry](/wiki/Chuck_Berry \"Chuck Berry\") and written by [Johnny Marks](/wiki/Johnny_Marks \"Johnny Marks\") and Marvin Brodie and published by St. Nicholas Music (ASCAP). The song was released as a single on Chess Records (label no. 1714) and has since been covered by numerous other artists, sometimes under the title \"Run, Run, Rudolph\". The song is a 12-bar blues and has a clear musical parallel to Chuck Berry's popular and recognizable song, \"[Johnny B. Goode](/wiki/Johnny_B._Goode \"Johnny B. Goode\")\" (1958);[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] it is also melodically identical to Berry's \"[Little Queenie](/wiki/Little_Queenie \"Little Queenie\")\" (1959).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n  * In [Ray Stevens](/wiki/Ray_Stevens \"Ray Stevens\")' novelty song \"Santa Claus Is Watching You\" (1962), Rudolph is replaced on Santa's team by \"Clyde the Camel\", a character from Steven's earlier hit, \"[Ahab the Arab](/wiki/Ahab_the_Arab \"Ahab the Arab\")\". In the original version, aimed at children in a similar fashion to \"[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town](/wiki/Santa_Claus_Is_Coming_to_Town \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\")\", Rudolph was said to be recuperating from an injury sustained during \"a [twist](/wiki/Twist_\\(dance\\) \"Twist \\(dance\\)\") contest\"; a later version, warning a lover away from [infidelity](/wiki/Infidelity \"Infidelity\") because Santa is watching, has Rudolph on a \"[stakeout](/wiki/Stakeout \"Stakeout\") at (the lover's) house\".\n\n### Television and webisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: Television and\nwebisodes\")]\n\n  * In the _[Doctor Who](/wiki/Doctor_Who \"Doctor Who\")_ promotional mini-webisode, \"[Songtaran Carols](/wiki/The_Snowmen#Prequels \"The Snowmen\")\" (2012), the [Sontaran](/wiki/Sontaran \"Sontaran\") warrior-nurse-detective, Strax, stated: \"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, had a very shiny nose. It proved to be a tactical disadvantage, because it enabled me to punch him in the dark.\"\n  * Rudolph along with Donder and Blitzen appear in the _Doctor Who_ Christmas special, _[Last Christmas](/wiki/Last_Christmas_\\(Doctor_Who\\) \"Last Christmas \\(Doctor Who\\)\")_.\n  * The anime and manga series [One Piece](/wiki/One_Piece \"One Piece\") has a main character called [Tony Tony Chopper](/wiki/Tony_Tony_Chopper \"Tony Tony Chopper\"), a shapeshifter born on Christmas Eve, who was often discriminated against because of his blue nose. However his background and story is otherwise very different.\n  * [MadTV](/wiki/MadTV \"MadTV\") featured Rudolph in a parody of the 1964 Rankin-Bass special called _Raging Rudolph_. Rudolph is beaten up for his red nose, and decides to get revenge on Santa Claus with Hermie the Elf by hiring Yukon Cornelius (a hitman in the special) to kill and decapitate Santa. Rudolph then takes over the North Pole. A sequel to the skit, _The Reinfather_ , shows Rudolph exacting revenge for his hitman's death in a nod to _[The Godfather](/wiki/The_Godfather_\\(film\\) \"The Godfather \\(film\\)\")_.\n\n## Relatives in different\nadaptations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Relatives in different\nadaptations\")]\n\nMain article: [Santa Claus's reindeer § Additional\nreindeer](/wiki/Santa_Claus%27s_reindeer#Additional_reindeer \"Santa Claus's\nreindeer\")\n\n### Parents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Parents\")]\n\n  * Robert L. May's original book does not name Rudolph's parents.\n  * The animated specials produced by both Rankin/Bass and GoodTimes Entertainment have given Rudolph different sets of parents: \n    * In Rankin/Bass's holiday special, he is [Donder](/wiki/Donder_the_reindeer#The_original_eight_reindeer \"Donder the reindeer\")'s son, and his mother is a tan doe who is called Mrs. Donder.\n    * In GoodTimes' retelling, Rudolph's father is [Blitzen](/wiki/Blitzen_the_Reindeer \"Blitzen the Reindeer\"), and his mother is named Mitzi.\n\n### Offspring[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Offspring\")]\n\nThree [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\") animations carry on the legend by introducing\nRudolph's son, [Robbie the Reindeer](/wiki/Robbie_the_Reindeer \"Robbie the\nReindeer\"). However, Rudolph is never directly mentioned by name (references\nare replaced by the first and second films' villain Blitzen interrupting with\nthe phrase, \"Don't say that name!\", or something similar, presumably for\n[copyright](/wiki/Copyright \"Copyright\") reasons.)\n\n### Siblings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Siblings\")]\n\nRudolph is also given a younger brother, Rusty Reindeer, in the American\nspecial, _[Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn't\nHappen](/wiki/Holidaze:_The_Christmas_That_Almost_Didn%27t_Happen \"Holidaze:\nThe Christmas That Almost Didn't Happen\")_ (2006). Unlike in the \"Robbie the\nReindeer\" cartoons, Rudolph's name is mentioned in the film.\n\nMichael Fry and [T. Lewis](/wiki/T._Lewis \"T.

Ralph's red nose is good for\ndefrosting Santa's sleigh and warming up toast and waffles; he enviously\ncomplains about his brother Rudolph's publicity and his own anonymity.\n\n### Aunts, uncles, and cousins[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Aunts, uncles, and\ncousins\")]\n\n  * Rudolph has a cousin, Leroy, in [Joe Diffie](/wiki/Joe_Diffie \"Joe Diffie\")'s 1995 song, \"[Leroy the Redneck Reindeer](/wiki/Leroy_the_Redneck_Reindeer \"Leroy the Redneck Reindeer\")\" (1995), which tells the story of Leroy's joining the sleigh team to substitute for Rudolph, who was ill.\n  * In GoodTimes' retelling, three of Santa's reindeer (Dasher, Comet, and Cupid) are his uncles, and Cupid's son Arrow is Rudolph's cousin and rival.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Calendar_icon.svg/22px-Calendar_icon.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Calendar_icon.svg)[Holidays portal](/wiki/Portal:Holidays \"Portal:Holidays\")\n\n  * [Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus \"Santa Claus\")\n  * [Santa Claus's reindeer](/wiki/Santa_Claus%27s_reindeer \"Santa Claus's reindeer\")\n  * [_Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer_ video game](/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_\\(video_game\\) \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer \\(video game\\)\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rudolph_the_Red-\nNosed_Reindeer&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Mikkelson, Barbara; Mikkelson, David P.
