        "# Tuberculosis vaccines\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**Tuberculosis (TB) vaccines** are [vaccinations](/wiki/Vaccination\n\"Vaccination\") intended for the prevention of\n[tuberculosis](/wiki/Tuberculosis \"Tuberculosis\"). Immunotherapy as a defence\nagainst TB was first proposed in 1890 by [Robert Koch](/wiki/Robert_Koch\n\"Robert Koch\").[1] Today, the only effective tuberculosis vaccine in common\nuse is [bacilli Calmette-Guérin](/wiki/BCG_vaccine \"BCG vaccine\") (BCG), first\nused in 1921.[2] About three out of every 10,000 people who get the vaccine\nexperience side effects, which are usually minor except in severely immuno-\ndepressed individuals. While BCG immunization provides fairly effective\nprotection for infants and young children,[3] (including defence against TB\nmeningitis and miliary TB),[4][5] its efficacy in adults is variable,[6]\nranging from 0% to 80%.[4][7] Several variables have been considered as\nresponsible for the varying outcomes.[4] Demand for TB immunotherapy\nadvancement exists because the disease has become increasingly drug-\nresistant.[1]\n\nOther tuberculosis vaccines are at various stages of development, including:\n\n  * [MVA85A](/wiki/MVA85A \"MVA85A\")\n  * [rBCG30](/wiki/RBCG30 \"RBCG30\")\n  * [72F fusion protein](/wiki/72F_fusion_protein \"72F fusion protein\")\n  * [ESAT6-Ag85b fusion protein](/w/index.php?title=ESAT6-Ag85b_fusion_protein&action=edit&redlink=1 \"ESAT6-Ag85b fusion protein \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n\nNew vaccines are being developed by the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative,\nincluding [TBVI](/wiki/TBVI \"TBVI\") and\n[Aeras](/w/index.php?title=Aeras&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Aeras \\(page does not\nexist\\)\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Vaccine development\n    * 1.1 Divisions\n    * 1.2 Sub-unit vaccines\n    * 1.3 Delivery alternatives\n    * 1.4 Obstacles in development\n  * 2 References\n\n## Vaccine\ndevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tuberculosis_vaccines&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Vaccine development\")]\n\nTo promote successful and lasting management of the TB epidemic, effective\nvaccination is required.[8] Although the World Health Organization (WHO)\nendorses a singular dose of [BCG](/wiki/BCG_vaccine \"BCG vaccine\"),\nrevaccination with BCG has been standardized in most, but not all\ncountries.[1][6] However, improved efficacy of multiple dosages has yet to be\ndemonstrated.[6]\n\n###\nDivisions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tuberculosis_vaccines&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Divisions\")]\n\n  * New priming vaccine to replace [BCG](/wiki/BCG_vaccine \"BCG vaccine\")\n  * Sub-unit/booster vaccines to supplement BCG\n\n### Sub-unit\nvaccines[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tuberculosis_vaccines&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Sub-unit vaccines\")]\n\n  1. Pre-infection\n  2. Booster to BCG\n  3. Post-infection\n  4. Therapeutic vaccine\n\nSince the BCG vaccine does not offer complete protection against TB, vaccines\nhave been designed to bolster BCG’s effectiveness. The industry has now\ntransitioned from developing new alternatives, to selecting the best options\ncurrently available to advance into clinical testing.[5] MVA85A is\ncharacterized as the “most advanced ‘boost’ candidate” to date.[2]\n\n### Delivery\nalternatives[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tuberculosis_vaccines&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Delivery alternatives\")]\n\nBCG is currently administered intradermally.[2] To improve efficacy, research\napproaches have been directed at modifying the delivery method of\nvaccinations.\n\nPatients can receive MVA85A intradermally or as an oral aerosol.[2] This\nparticular combination proved to be protective against mycobacterial invasion\nin animals, and both modes are well tolerated.[2] The design incentive behind\naerosol delivery is to target the lungs rapidly, easily and painlessly[7] in\ncontrast to intradermal immunization. In murine studies, intradermal\nvaccination caused localized inflammation at the site of injection whereas\nMVA85A did not cause unfavourable effects.[2] A correlation has been found\nbetween the mode of delivery and vaccine protection efficacy.[2] Research data\nsuggests aerosol delivery has not only physiological and economic\nadvantages,[7] but also the potential to supplement systemic vaccination.[2]\n\n### Obstacles in\ndevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tuberculosis_vaccines&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Obstacles in development\")]\n\nTreatment and prevention of TB has been delayed compared to the resources and\nresearch efforts put into other diseases. Large pharmaceutical companies do\nnot see profitable investment because of TB’s association with the developing\nworld.[4] 2 vaccination are required for tb Progression of vaccine designs\nrelies heavily on outcomes in animal models. Appropriate animal models are\nscarce because it is difficult to imitate TB in non-human species.[3][4] It is\nalso challenging finding a species to test on a large-scale.[3] Most animal\ntesting for TB vaccines has been conducted on murine, bovine and non-primate\nspecies.[3] Recently, a study deemed [zebrafish](/wiki/Zebrafish \"Zebrafish\")\na potentially suitable model organism for preclinical vaccine development.[3]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tuberculosis_vaccines&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Prabowo, S. et al. \"Targeting multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) by therapeutic vaccines.\" Med Microbiol Immunol 202 (2013): 95–1041.
