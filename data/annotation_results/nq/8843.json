In practice, almost all computers use a [storage\nhierarchy](/wiki/Memory_hierarchy \"Memory hierarchy\"),[1]:468–473 which puts\nfast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but\nlarger and cheaper options farther away. Generally the fast volatile\ntechnologies (which lose data when off power) are referred to as \"memory\",\nwhile slower persistent technologies are referred to as \"storage\".\n\nIn the [Von Neumann architecture](/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture \"Von Neumann\narchitecture\"), the CPU consists of two main parts: The [control\nunit](/wiki/Control_unit \"Control unit\") and the [arithmetic logic\nunit](/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit \"Arithmetic logic unit\") (ALU). The former\ncontrols the flow of data between the CPU and memory, while the latter\nperforms arithmetic and [logical operations](/wiki/Bitwise_operations \"Bitwise\noperations\") on data.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Functionality\n  * 2 Data organization and representation\n  * 3 Hierarchy of storage\n    * 3.1 Primary storage\n    * 3.2 Secondary storage\n    * 3.3 Tertiary storage\n    * 3.4 Off-line storage\n  * 4 Characteristics of storage\n    * 4.1 Volatility\n    * 4.2 Mutability\n    * 4.3 Accessibility\n    * 4.4 Addressability\n    * 4.5 Capacity\n    * 4.6 Performance\n    * 4.7 Energy use\n  * 5 Storage media\n    * 5.1 Semiconductor\n    * 5.2 Magnetic\n    * 5.3 Optical\n    * 5.4 Paper\n    * 5.5 Other storage media or substrates\n  * 6 Related technologies\n    * 6.1 Redundancy\n    * 6.2 Network connectivity\n    * 6.3 Robotic storage\n  * 7 See also\n    * 7.1 Primary storage topics\n    * 7.2 Secondary, tertiary and off-line storage topics\n    * 7.3 Data storage conferences\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 Further reading\n\n##\nFunctionality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Functionality\")]\n\nWithout a significant amount of memory, a computer would merely be able to\nperform fixed operations and immediately output the result. It would have to\nbe reconfigured to change its behavior. This is acceptable for devices such as\ndesk [calculators](/wiki/Calculator \"Calculator\"), [digital signal\nprocessors](/wiki/Digital_signal_processing \"Digital signal processing\"), and\nother specialized devices. [Von Neumann](/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture \"Von\nNeumann architecture\") machines differ in having a memory in which they store\ntheir operating [instructions](/wiki/Instruction_\\(computer_science\\)\n\"Instruction \\(computer science\\)\") and data.[1]:20 Such computers are more\nversatile in that they do not need to have their hardware reconfigured for\neach new program, but can simply be [reprogrammed](/wiki/Computer_programming\n\"Computer programming\") with new in-memory instructions; they also tend to be\nsimpler to design, in that a relatively simple processor may keep\n[state](/wiki/Program_state \"Program state\") between successive computations\nto build up complex procedural results. Most modern computers are von Neumann\nmachines.\n\n## Data organization and\nrepresentation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Data organization and representation\")]\n\nA modern [digital computer](/wiki/Computer \"Computer\") represents\n[data](/wiki/Data \"Data\") using the [binary numeral\nsystem](/wiki/Binary_numeral_system \"Binary numeral system\"). Text, numbers,\npictures, audio, and nearly any other form of information can be converted\ninto a string of [bits](/wiki/Bit \"Bit\"), or binary digits, each of which has\na value of 1 or 0. The most common unit of storage is the [byte](/wiki/Byte\n\"Byte\"), equal to 8 bits. A piece of information can be handled by any\ncomputer or device whose storage space is large enough to accommodate _the\nbinary representation of the piece of information_ , or simply\n[data](/wiki/Data_\\(computing\\) \"Data \\(computing\\)\"). For example, the\n[complete works of Shakespeare](/wiki/Complete_works_of_Shakespeare \"Complete\nworks of Shakespeare\"), about 1250 pages in print, can be stored in about five\n[megabytes](/wiki/Megabyte \"Megabyte\") (40 million bits) with one byte per\ncharacter.\n\nData are [encoded](/wiki/Encoding \"Encoding\") by assigning a bit pattern to\neach [character](/wiki/Character_\\(computing\\) \"Character \\(computing\\)\"),\n[digit](/wiki/Numerical_digit \"Numerical digit\"), or\n[multimedia](/wiki/Multimedia \"Multimedia\") object. Many standards exist for\nencoding (e.g., [character encodings](/wiki/Character_encoding \"Character\nencoding\") like [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII \"ASCII\"), image encodings like\n[JPEG](/wiki/JPEG \"JPEG\"), video encodings like [MPEG-4](/wiki/MPEG-4\n\"MPEG-4\")).\n\nBy adding bits to each encoded unit, redundancy allows the computer to both\ndetect errors in coded data and correct them based on mathematical algorithms.\nErrors generally occur in low probabilities due to [random](/wiki/Random\n\"Random\") bit value flipping, or \"physical bit fatigue\", loss of the physical\nbit in storage of its ability to maintain a distinguishable value (0 or 1), or\ndue to errors in inter or intra-computer communication. A random [bit\nflip](/wiki/RAM_parity \"RAM parity\") (e.g., due to random\n[radiation](/wiki/Radiation \"Radiation\")) is typically corrected upon\ndetection. A bit, or a group of malfunctioning physical bits (not always the\nspecific defective bit is known; group definition depends on specific storage\ndevice) is typically automatically fenced-out, taken out of use by the device,\nand replaced with another functioning equivalent group in the device, where\nthe corrected bit values are restored (if possible). The [cyclic redundancy\ncheck](/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check \"Cyclic redundancy check\") (CRC) method\nis typically used in communications and storage for [error\ndetection](/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction \"Error detection and\ncorrection\"). A detected error is then retried.\n\n[Data compression](/wiki/Data_compression \"Data compression\") methods allow in\nmany cases (such as a database) to represent a string of bits by a shorter bit\nstring (\"compress\") and reconstruct the original string (\"decompress\") when\nneeded. This utilizes substantially less storage (tens of percents) for many\ntypes of data at the cost of more computation (compress and decompress when\nneeded). Analysis of trade-off between storage cost saving and costs of\nrelated computations and possible delays in data availability is done before\ndeciding whether to keep certain data compressed or not.\n\nFor [security reasons](/wiki/Data_security \"Data security\") certain types of\ndata (e.g., credit-card information) may be kept [encrypted](/wiki/Encryption\n\"Encryption\") in storage to prevent the possibility of unauthorized\ninformation reconstruction from chunks of storage snapshots.\n\n## Hierarchy of\nstorage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Hierarchy of storage\")]\n\nMain article: [Memory hierarchy](/wiki/Memory_hierarchy \"Memory hierarchy\")\n\n![Accuracy\ndispute](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Ambox_contradict.svg/40px-\nAmbox_contradict.svg.png)| This article **appears to contradict the\narticle[Memory hierarchy](/wiki/Memory_hierarchy \"Memory hierarchy\")**.

The fundamental components of a general-purpose computer are\n[arithmetic and logic unit](/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit \"Arithmetic logic\nunit\"), [control circuitry](/wiki/Control_unit \"Control unit\"), storage space,\nand [input/output](/wiki/Input/output \"Input/output\") devices. Technology and\ncapacity as in common [home computers](/wiki/Home_computer \"Home computer\")\naround 2005.\n\nGenerally, the lower a storage is in the hierarchy, the lesser its\n[bandwidth](/wiki/Bandwidth_\\(computing\\) \"Bandwidth \\(computing\\)\") and the\ngreater its access [latency](/wiki/Latency_\\(engineering\\) \"Latency\n\\(engineering\\)\") is from the CPU. This traditional division of storage to\nprimary, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage is also guided by cost per\nbit.\n\nIn contemporary usage, \"memory\" is usually [semiconductor](/wiki/Semiconductor\n\"Semiconductor\") storage read-write [random-access memory](/wiki/Random-\naccess_memory \"Random-access memory\"), typically [DRAM](/wiki/DRAM \"DRAM\")\n(dynamic RAM) or other forms of fast but temporary storage. \"Storage\" consists\nof storage devices and their media not directly accessible by the\n[CPU](/wiki/CPU \"CPU\") ([secondary](/wiki/Secondary_storage \"Secondary\nstorage\") or [tertiary storage](/wiki/Tertiary_storage \"Tertiary storage\")),\ntypically [hard disk drives](/wiki/Hard_disk_drive \"Hard disk drive\"),\n[optical disc](/wiki/Optical_disc \"Optical disc\") drives, and other devices\nslower than RAM but [non-volatile](/wiki/Non-volatile_memory \"Non-volatile\nmemory\") (retaining contents when powered down).[2]\n\nHistorically, _memory_ has been called _core memory_ , _main memory_ , _real\nstorage_ or _internal memory_. Meanwhile, non-volatile storage devices have\nbeen referred to as _secondary storage_ , _external memory_ or\n_auxiliary/peripheral storage_.\n\n### Primary\nstorage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Primary storage\")]\n\nMain article: [Computer memory](/wiki/Computer_memory \"Computer memory\")\n\n_Primary storage_ (also known as _main memory_ or _internal memory_), often\nreferred to simply as _memory_ , is the only one directly accessible to the\nCPU. The CPU continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as\nrequired. Any data actively operated on is also stored there in uniform\nmanner.\n\nHistorically, [early computers](/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware \"History\nof computing hardware\") used [delay lines](/wiki/Delay_line_memory \"Delay line\nmemory\"), [Williams tubes](/wiki/Williams_tube \"Williams tube\"), or rotating\n[magnetic drums](/wiki/Drum_memory \"Drum memory\") as primary storage. By 1954,\nthose unreliable methods were mostly replaced by [magnetic core\nmemory](/wiki/Magnetic_core_memory \"Magnetic core memory\"). Core memory\nremained dominant until the 1970s, when advances in [integrated\ncircuit](/wiki/Integrated_circuit \"Integrated circuit\") technology allowed\n[semiconductor memory](/wiki/Semiconductor_memory \"Semiconductor memory\") to\nbecome economically competitive.\n\nThis led to modern [random-access memory](/wiki/Random-access_memory \"Random-\naccess memory\") (RAM). It is small-sized, light, but quite expensive at the\nsame time. (The particular types of RAM used for primary storage are also\n[volatile](/wiki/Volatile_memory \"Volatile memory\"), i.e. they lose the\ninformation when not powered).\n\nAs shown in the diagram, traditionally there are two more sub-layers of the\nprimary storage, besides main large-capacity RAM:\n\n  * [Processor registers](/wiki/Processor_register \"Processor register\") are located inside the processor. Each register typically holds a [word](/wiki/Word_\\(computer_architecture\\) \"Word \\(computer architecture\\)\") of data (often 32 or 64 bits). CPU instructions instruct the [arithmetic logic unit](/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit \"Arithmetic logic unit\") to perform various calculations or other operations on this data (or with the help of it). Registers are the fastest of all forms of computer data storage.\n  * [Processor cache](/wiki/CPU_cache \"CPU cache\") is an intermediate stage between ultra-fast registers and much slower main memory. It was introduced solely to improve the performance of computers. Most actively used information in the main memory is just duplicated in the cache memory, which is faster, but of much lesser capacity. On the other hand, main memory is much slower, but has a much greater storage capacity than processor registers. Multi-level [hierarchical cache](/wiki/Memory_hierarchy \"Memory hierarchy\") setup is also commonly used— _primary cache_ being smallest, fastest and located inside the processor; _secondary cache_ being somewhat larger and slower.\n\nMain memory is directly or indirectly connected to the central processing unit\nvia a _memory bus_. It is actually two buses (not on the diagram): an [address\nbus](/wiki/Address_bus \"Address bus\") and a [data bus](/wiki/Bus_\\(computing\\)\n\"Bus \\(computing\\)\"). The CPU firstly sends a number through an address bus, a\nnumber called [memory address](/wiki/Memory_address \"Memory address\"), that\nindicates the desired location of data. Then it reads or writes the data in\nthe [memory cells](/wiki/Memory_cell_\\(computing\\) \"Memory cell\n\\(computing\\)\") using the data bus. Additionally, a [memory management\nunit](/wiki/Memory_management_unit \"Memory management unit\") (MMU) is a small\ndevice between CPU and RAM recalculating the actual memory address, for\nexample to provide an abstraction of [virtual memory](/wiki/Virtual_memory\n\"Virtual memory\") or other tasks.\n\nAs the RAM types used for primary storage are volatile (uninitialized at start\nup), a computer containing only such storage would not have a source to read\ninstructions from, in order to start the computer. Hence, [non-volatile\nprimary storage](/wiki/Non-volatile_memory \"Non-volatile memory\") containing a\nsmall startup program ([BIOS](/wiki/BIOS \"BIOS\")) is used to\n[bootstrap](/wiki/Bootstrapping_\\(computing\\) \"Bootstrapping \\(computing\\)\")\nthe computer, that is, to read a larger program from non-volatile _secondary_\nstorage to RAM and start to execute it. A non-volatile technology used for\nthis purpose is called ROM, for [read-only memory](/wiki/Read-only_memory\n\"Read-only memory\") (the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM\ntypes are also capable of _[random access](/wiki/Random_access \"Random\naccess\")_).\n\nMany types of \"ROM\" are not literally _read only_ , as updates to them are\npossible; however it is slow and memory must be erased in large portions\nbefore it can be re-written. Some [embedded systems](/wiki/Embedded_system\n\"Embedded system\") run programs directly from ROM (or similar), because such\nprograms are rarely changed. Standard computers do not store non-rudimentary\nprograms in ROM, and rather, use large capacities of secondary storage, which\nis non-volatile as well, and not as costly.\n\nRecently, _primary storage_ and _secondary storage_ in some uses refer to what\nwas historically called, respectively, _secondary storage_ and _tertiary\nstorage_.[3]\n\n### Secondary\nstorage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Secondary storage\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/35-Desktop-Hard-\nDrive.jpg/220px-35-Desktop-Hard-Drive.jpg)](/wiki/File:35-Desktop-Hard-\nDrive.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:35-Desktop-Hard-Drive.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [hard disk drive](/wiki/Hard_disk_drive \"Hard disk drive\") with protective\ncover removed\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-\nMergefrom.svg.png)| It has been suggested that _[Auxiliary\nmemory](/wiki/Auxiliary_memory \"Auxiliary memory\")_ be\n[merged](/wiki/Wikipedia:Merging \"Wikipedia:Merging\") into this article.\n([Discuss](/wiki/Talk:Auxiliary_memory#Merge_to_Secondary_Storage\n\"Talk:Auxiliary memory\"))_Proposed since November 2017._  \n---|---  \n  \nMain article: [Auxiliary memory](/wiki/Auxiliary_memory \"Auxiliary memory\")\n\n_Secondary storage_ (also known as _external memory_ or _auxiliary storage_),\ndiffers from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU.\nThe computer usually uses its [input/output](/wiki/Input/output\n\"Input/output\") channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired\ndata using [intermediate area](/wiki/Data_buffer \"Data buffer\") in primary\nstorage. Secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered\ndown—it is non-volatile. Per unit, it is typically also two orders of\nmagnitude less expensive than primary storage. Modern computer systems\ntypically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary\nstorage and data are kept for a longer time there.\n\nIn modern computers, [hard disk drives](/wiki/Hard_disk_drive \"Hard disk\ndrive\") are usually used as secondary storage. The time taken to access a\ngiven byte of information stored on a hard disk is typically a few thousandths\nof a second, or milliseconds. By contrast, the time taken to access a given\nbyte of information stored in random-access memory is measured in billionths\nof a second, or nanoseconds. This illustrates the significant access-time\ndifference which distinguishes solid-state memory from rotating magnetic\nstorage devices: hard disks are typically about a million times slower than\nmemory. Rotating [optical storage](/wiki/Optical_disc_drive \"Optical disc\ndrive\") devices, such as [CD](/wiki/Compact_Disc \"Compact Disc\") and\n[DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") drives, have even longer access times. With disk\ndrives, once the disk read/write head reaches the proper placement and the\ndata of interest rotates under it, subsequent data on the track are very fast\nto access. To reduce the seek time and rotational latency, data are\ntransferred to and from disks in large contiguous blocks.\n\nWhen data reside on disk, accessing them in large blocks to hide latency\noffers an opportunity to design efficient [external memory\nalgorithms](/wiki/External_memory_algorithms \"External memory algorithms\").\nSequential or block access on disks is orders of magnitude faster than random\naccess, and many sophisticated paradigms have been developed to design\nefficient algorithms based upon sequential and block access. Another way to\nreduce the I/O bottleneck is to use multiple disks in parallel in order to\nincrease the bandwidth between primary and secondary memory.[4]\n\nSome other examples of secondary storage technologies are [flash\nmemory](/wiki/Flash_memory \"Flash memory\") (e.g. [USB flash\ndrives](/wiki/USB_flash_drive \"USB flash drive\") or keys), [floppy\ndisks](/wiki/Floppy_disk \"Floppy disk\"), [magnetic\ntape](/wiki/Magnetic_tape_data_storage \"Magnetic tape data storage\"), [paper\ntape](/wiki/Punched_tape \"Punched tape\"), [punched cards](/wiki/Punched_card\n\"Punched card\"), standalone [RAM disks](/wiki/RAM_disk \"RAM disk\"), and\n[Iomega Zip drives](/wiki/Iomega_Zip_drive \"Iomega Zip drive\").\n\nThe secondary storage is often formatted according to a [file\nsystem](/wiki/File_system \"File system\") format, which provides the\nabstraction necessary to organize data into [files](/wiki/Computer_file\n\"Computer file\") and [directories](/wiki/Directory_\\(computing\\) \"Directory\n\\(computing\\)\"), providing also additional information (called\n[metadata](/wiki/Metadata \"Metadata\")) describing the owner of a certain file,\nthe access time, the access permissions, and other information.\n\nMost computer [operating systems](/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\")\nuse the concept of [virtual memory](/wiki/Virtual_memory \"Virtual memory\"),\nallowing utilization of more primary storage capacity than is physically\navailable in the system. As the primary memory fills up, the system moves the\nleast-used chunks (_[pages](/wiki/Page_\\(computing\\) \"Page \\(computing\\)\")_)\nto secondary storage devices (to a [swap file](/wiki/Paging \"Paging\") or [page\nfile](/wiki/Paging \"Paging\")), retrieving them later when they are needed. As\nmore of these retrievals from slower secondary storage are necessary, the more\nthe overall system performance is degraded.\n\n### Tertiary\nstorage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Tertiary storage\")]\n\nSee also: [Nearline storage](/wiki/Nearline_storage \"Nearline storage\") and\n[Cloud storage](/wiki/Cloud_storage \"Cloud storage\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/StorageTek_Powderhorn_tape_library.jpg/220px-\nStorageTek_Powderhorn_tape_library.jpg)](/wiki/File:StorageTek_Powderhorn_tape_library.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:StorageTek_Powderhorn_tape_library.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA large [tape library](/wiki/Tape_library \"Tape library\"), with tape\ncartridges placed on shelves in the front, and a robotic arm moving in the\nback. Visible height of the library is about 180 cm.\n\n_Tertiary storage_ or _tertiary memory_[5] provides a third level of storage.\nTypically, it involves a robotic mechanism which will _mount_ (insert) and\n_dismount_ removable mass storage media into a storage device according to the\nsystem's demands; such data are often copied to secondary storage before use.\nIt is primarily used for archiving rarely accessed information since it is\nmuch slower than secondary storage (e.g. 5–60 seconds vs. 1–10 milliseconds).\nThis is primarily useful for extraordinarily large data stores, accessed\nwithout human operators. Typical examples include [tape\nlibraries](/wiki/Tape_library \"Tape library\") and [optical\njukeboxes](/wiki/Optical_jukebox \"Optical jukebox\").\n\nWhen a computer needs to read information from the tertiary storage, it will\nfirst consult a catalog [database](/wiki/Database \"Database\") to determine\nwhich tape or disc contains the information. Next, the computer will instruct\na [robotic arm](/wiki/Industrial_robot \"Industrial robot\") to fetch the medium\nand place it in a drive. When the computer has finished reading the\ninformation, the robotic arm will return the medium to its place in the\nlibrary.\n\nTertiary storage is also known as _[nearline storage](/wiki/Nearline_storage\n\"Nearline storage\")_ because it is \"near to online\". The formal distinction\nbetween online, nearline, and offline storage is:[6]\n\n  * Online storage is immediately available for I/O.\n  * Nearline storage is not immediately available, but can be made online quickly without human intervention.\n  * Offline storage is not immediately available, and requires some human intervention to become online.\n\nFor example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while\nspinning drives that spin down automatically, such as in massive arrays of\nidle disks ([MAID](/wiki/MAID \"MAID\")), are nearline storage. Removable media\nsuch as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in [tape\nlibraries](/wiki/Tape_library \"Tape library\"), are nearline storage, while\ntape cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline storage.\n\n### Off-line\nstorage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Off-line storage\")]\n\n_Off-line storage_ is a computer data storage on a medium or a device that is\nnot under the control of a [processing unit](/wiki/Central_processing_unit\n\"Central processing unit\").[7] The medium is recorded, usually in a secondary\nor tertiary storage device, and then physically removed or disconnected. It\nmust be inserted or connected by a human operator before a computer can access\nit again. Unlike tertiary storage, it cannot be accessed without human\ninteraction.\n\n[Off-line](/wiki/Online_and_offline \"Online and offline\") storage is used to\n[transfer information](/wiki/Data_transmission \"Data transmission\"), since the\ndetached medium can be easily physically transported. Additionally, in case a\ndisaster, for example a fire, destroys the original data, a medium in a remote\nlocation will probably be unaffected, enabling [disaster\nrecovery](/wiki/Disaster_recovery \"Disaster recovery\"). Off-line storage\nincreases general [information security](/wiki/Information_security\n\"Information security\"), since it is physically inaccessible from a computer,\nand data confidentiality or integrity cannot be affected by computer-based\nattack techniques. Also, if the information stored for archival purposes is\nrarely accessed, off-line storage is less expensive than tertiary storage.\n\nIn modern personal computers, most secondary and tertiary storage media are\nalso used for off-line storage. Optical discs and flash memory devices are\nmost popular, and to much lesser extent removable hard disk drives. In\nenterprise uses, magnetic tape is predominant. Older examples are floppy\ndisks, Zip disks, or punched cards.\n\n## Characteristics of\nstorage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Characteristics of storage\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Samsung-1GB-\nDDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg/250px-Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-\nRAM.jpg)](/wiki/File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA 1 GB module of [laptop](/wiki/SO-DIMM \"SO-DIMM\") [DDR2](/wiki/DDR2_SDRAM\n\"DDR2 SDRAM\") [RAM](/wiki/Random-access_memory \"Random-access memory\").\n\nStorage technologies at all levels of the storage hierarchy can be\ndifferentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring\ncharacteristics specific to a particular implementation. These core\ncharacteristics are volatility, mutability, accessibility, and addressability.\nFor any particular implementation of any storage technology, the\ncharacteristics worth measuring are capacity and performance.\n\n###\nVolatility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Volatility\")]\n\n[Non-volatile memory](/wiki/Non-volatile_memory \"Non-volatile memory\") retains\nthe stored information even if not constantly supplied with electric power.[8]\nIt is suitable for long-term storage of information. [Volatile\nmemory](/wiki/Volatile_memory \"Volatile memory\") requires constant power to\nmaintain the stored information. The fastest memory technologies are volatile\nones, although that is not a universal rule. Since the primary storage is\nrequired to be very fast, it predominantly uses volatile memory.\n\n[Dynamic random-access memory](/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory \"Dynamic\nrandom-access memory\") is a form of volatile memory that also requires the\nstored information to be periodically reread and rewritten, or\n[refreshed](/wiki/Memory_refresh \"Memory refresh\"), otherwise it would vanish.\n[Static random-access memory](/wiki/Static_random-access_memory \"Static\nrandom-access memory\") is a form of volatile memory similar to DRAM with the\nexception that it never needs to be refreshed as long as power is applied; it\nloses its content when the power supply is lost.\n\nAn [uninterruptible power supply](/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply\n\"Uninterruptible power supply\") (UPS) can be used to give a computer a brief\nwindow of time to move information from primary volatile storage into non-\nvolatile storage before the batteries are exhausted. Some systems, for example\n[EMC Symmetrix](/wiki/EMC_Symmetrix \"EMC Symmetrix\"), have integrated\nbatteries that maintain volatile storage for several minutes.\n\n###\nMutability[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Mutability\")]\n\nRead/write storage or mutable storage\n\n    Allows information to be overwritten at any time. A computer without some amount of read/write storage for primary storage purposes would be useless for many tasks. Modern computers typically use read/write storage also for secondary storage.\nRead only storage\n\n    Retains the information stored at the time of manufacture, and _write once storage_ ([write once read many](/wiki/Write_once_read_many \"Write once read many\")) allows the information to be written only once at some point after manufacture. These are called _immutable storage_. Immutable storage is used for tertiary and off-line storage. Examples include [CD-ROM](/wiki/CD-ROM \"CD-ROM\") and [CD-R](/wiki/CD-R \"CD-R\").\nSlow write, fast read storage\n\n    Read/write storage which allows information to be overwritten multiple times, but with the write operation being much slower than the read operation. Examples include [CD-RW](/wiki/CD-RW \"CD-RW\") and [swayne memory](/w/index.php?title=Swayne_memory&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Swayne memory \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n\n###\nAccessibility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Accessibility\")]\n\n[Random access](/wiki/Random_access \"Random access\")\n\n    Any location in storage can be accessed at any moment in approximately the same amount of time. Such characteristic is well suited for primary and secondary storage. Most semiconductor memories and disk drives provide random access.\n[Sequential access](/wiki/Sequential_access \"Sequential access\")\n\n    The accessing of pieces of information will be in a serial order, one after the other; therefore the time to access a particular piece of information depends upon which piece of information was last accessed. Such characteristic is typical of off-line storage.\n\n###\nAddressability[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Addressability\")]\n\nLocation-addressable\n\n    Each individually accessible unit of information in storage is selected with its numerical [memory address](/wiki/Memory_address \"Memory address\"). In modern computers, location-addressable storage usually limits to primary storage, accessed internally by computer programs, since location-addressability is very efficient, but burdensome for humans.\n[File addressable](/wiki/File_system \"File system\")\n\n    Information is divided into _[files](/wiki/Computer_file \"Computer file\")_ of variable length, and a particular file is selected with [human-readable](/wiki/Human-readable \"Human-readable\") directory and file names. The underlying device is still location-addressable, but the [operating system](/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\") of a computer provides the file system [abstraction](/wiki/Abstraction_\\(computer_science\\) \"Abstraction \\(computer science\\)\") to make the operation more understandable. In modern computers, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage use file systems.\n[Content-addressable](/wiki/Content-addressable_memory \"Content-addressable\nmemory\")\n\n    Each individually accessible unit of information is selected based on the basis of (part of) the contents stored there. Content-addressable storage can be implemented using [software](/wiki/Software \"Software\") (computer program) or [hardware](/wiki/Personal_computer_hardware \"Personal computer hardware\") (computer device), with hardware being faster but more expensive option. Hardware content addressable memory is often used in a computer's [CPU cache](/wiki/CPU_cache \"CPU cache\").\n\n###\nCapacity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Capacity\")]\n\nRaw capacity\n\n    The total amount of stored information that a storage device or medium can hold. It is expressed as a quantity of [bits](/wiki/Bit \"Bit\") or [bytes](/wiki/Byte \"Byte\") (e.g. 10.4 [megabytes](/wiki/Megabyte \"Megabyte\")).\n[Memory storage density](/wiki/Memory_storage_density \"Memory storage\ndensity\")\n\n    The compactness of stored information. It is the storage capacity of a medium divided with a unit of length, area or volume (e.g. 1.2 megabytes per square inch).\n\n###\nPerformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Performance\")]\n\n[Latency](/wiki/Latency_\\(engineering\\) \"Latency \\(engineering\\)\")\n\n    The time it takes to access a particular location in storage. The relevant [unit of measurement](/wiki/Units_of_measurement \"Units of measurement\") is typically [nanosecond](/wiki/1_E-9_s \"1 E-9 s\") for primary storage, [millisecond](/wiki/Millisecond \"Millisecond\") for secondary storage, and [second](/wiki/Second \"Second\") for tertiary storage. It may make sense to separate read latency and write latency (especially for non-volatile memory[8]) and in case of sequential access storage, minimum, maximum and average latency.\n[Throughput](/wiki/Throughput \"Throughput\")\n\n    The rate at which information can be read from or written to the storage. In computer data storage, throughput is usually expressed in terms of megabytes per second (MB/s), though [bit rate](/wiki/Bit_rate \"Bit rate\") may also be used. As with latency, read rate and write rate may need to be differentiated. Also accessing media sequentially, as opposed to randomly, typically yields maximum throughput.\nGranularity\n\n    The size of the largest \"chunk\" of data that can be efficiently accessed as a single unit, e.g. without introducing additional latency.\nReliability\n\n    The probability of spontaneous bit value change under various conditions, or overall [failure rate](/wiki/Failure_rate \"Failure rate\").\n\nUtilities such as [hdparm](/wiki/Hdparm \"Hdparm\") and [sar](/wiki/Sar_\\(Unix\\)\n\"Sar \\(Unix\\)\") can be used to measure IO performance in Linux.\n\n### Energy\nuse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Energy use\")]\n\n  * Storage devices that reduce fan usage, automatically shut-down during inactivity, and low power hard drives can reduce energy consumption by 90 percent.[9]\n  * 2.5-inch hard disk drives often consume less power than larger ones.[10][11] Low capacity [solid-state drives](/wiki/Solid-state_drive \"Solid-state drive\") have no moving parts and consume less power than hard disks.[12][13][14] Also, memory may use more power than hard disks.[14] Large caches, which are used to avoid hitting [memory wall](/wiki/Random-access_memory#Memory_wall \"Random-access memory\"), may also consume a large amount of power.[15]\n\n## Storage\nmedia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Storage media\")]\n\nAs of\n2011[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit),\nthe most commonly used data storage media are semiconductor, magnetic, and\noptical, while paper still sees some limited usage.

The motivation behind developing this technology was the possibility of far greater storage capacities than either magnetic tape or optical discs.\n\n[Phase-change memory](/wiki/Phase-change_memory \"Phase-change memory\")\n\n    uses different mechanical phases of [phase-change material](/wiki/Phase-change_material \"Phase-change material\") to store information in an X-Y addressable matrix, and reads the information by observing the varying [electrical resistance](/wiki/Electrical_resistance \"Electrical resistance\") of the material. Phase-change memory would be non-volatile, random-access read/write storage, and might be used for primary, secondary and off-line storage. Most rewritable and many write once optical disks already use phase change material to store information.\n\n[Holographic data storage](/wiki/Holographic_data_storage \"Holographic data\nstorage\")\n\n    stores information optically inside [crystals](/wiki/Crystal \"Crystal\") or [photopolymers](/wiki/Photopolymer \"Photopolymer\"). Holographic storage can utilize the whole volume of the storage medium, unlike optical disc storage which is limited to a small number of surface layers.

The following solutions are commonly used and valid for\nmost storage devices:\n\n  * **Device[mirroring](/wiki/Disk_mirroring \"Disk mirroring\") (replication)** – A common solution to the problem is constantly maintaining an identical copy of device content on another device (typically of a same type). The downside is that this doubles the storage, and both devices (copies) need to be updated simultaneously with some overhead and possibly some delays. The upside is possible concurrent read of a same data group by two independent processes, which increases performance. When one of the replicated devices is detected to be defective, the other copy is still operational, and is being utilized to generate a new copy on another device (usually available operational in a pool of stand-by devices for this purpose).\n  * **Redundant array of independent disks** (**[RAID](/wiki/RAID \"RAID\")**) – This method generalizes the device mirroring above by allowing one device in a group of N devices to fail and be replaced with the content restored (Device mirroring is RAID with N=2). RAID groups of N=5 or N=6 are common. N>2 saves storage, when comparing with N=2, at the cost of more processing during both regular operation (with often reduced performance) and defective device replacement.\n\nDevice mirroring and typical RAID are designed to handle a single device\nfailure in the RAID group of devices. However, if a second failure occurs\nbefore the RAID group is completely repaired from the first failure, then data\ncan be lost. The probability of a single failure is typically small. Thus the\nprobability of two failures in a same RAID group in time proximity is much\nsmaller (approximately the probability squared, i.e., multiplied by itself).\nIf a database cannot tolerate even such smaller probability of data loss, then\nthe RAID group itself is replicated (mirrored). In many cases such mirroring\nis done geographically remotely, in a different storage array, to handle also\nrecovery from disasters (see disaster recovery above).\n\n### Network\nconnectivity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Network connectivity\")]\n\nA secondary or tertiary storage may connect to a computer utilizing [computer\nnetworks](/wiki/Computer_network \"Computer network\"). This concept does not\npertain to the primary storage, which is shared between multiple processors to\na lesser degree.\n\n  * [Direct-attached storage](/wiki/Direct-attached_storage \"Direct-attached storage\") (DAS) is a traditional mass storage, that does not use any network. This is still a most popular approach. This [retronym](/wiki/Retronym \"Retronym\") was coined recently, together with NAS and SAN.\n  * [Network-attached storage](/wiki/Network-attached_storage \"Network-attached storage\") (NAS) is mass storage attached to a computer which another computer can access at file level over a [local area network](/wiki/Local_area_network \"Local area network\"), a private [wide area network](/wiki/Wide_area_network \"Wide area network\"), or in the case of [online file storage](/wiki/File_hosting_service \"File hosting service\"), over the [Internet](/wiki/Internet \"Internet\"). NAS is commonly associated with the [NFS](/wiki/Network_File_System_\\(protocol\\) \"Network File System \\(protocol\\)\") and [CIFS/SMB](/wiki/Server_Message_Block \"Server Message Block\") protocols.\n  * [Storage area network](/wiki/Storage_area_network \"Storage area network\") (SAN) is a specialized network, that provides other computers with storage capacity. The crucial difference between NAS and SAN, is that NAS presents and manages file systems to client computers, while SAN provides access at block-addressing (raw) level, leaving it to attaching systems to manage data or file systems within the provided capacity. SAN is commonly associated with [Fibre Channel](/wiki/Fibre_Channel \"Fibre Channel\") networks.\n\n### Robotic\nstorage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Robotic storage\")]\n\nLarge quantities of individual magnetic tapes, and optical or magneto-optical\ndiscs may be stored in robotic tertiary storage devices. In tape storage field\nthey are known as [tape libraries](/wiki/Tape_library \"Tape library\"), and in\noptical storage field [optical jukeboxes](/wiki/Optical_jukebox \"Optical\njukebox\"), or optical disk libraries per analogy. Smallest forms of either\ntechnology containing just one drive device are referred to as\n[autoloaders](/wiki/Autoloader_\\(data_storage_device\\) \"Autoloader \\(data\nstorage device\\)\") or [autochangers](/wiki/Autochanger \"Autochanger\").\n\nRobotic-access storage devices may have a number of slots, each holding\nindividual media, and usually one or more picking robots that traverse the\nslots and load media to built-in drives. The arrangement of the slots and\npicking devices affects performance. Important characteristics of such storage\nare possible expansion options: adding slots, modules, drives, robots. Tape\nlibraries may have from 10 to more than 100,000 slots, and provide\n[terabytes](/wiki/Terabyte \"Terabyte\") or [petabytes](/wiki/Petabyte\n\"Petabyte\") of near-line information. Optical jukeboxes are somewhat smaller\nsolutions, up to 1,000 slots.\n\nRobotic storage is used for [backups](/wiki/Backup \"Backup\"), and for high-\ncapacity archives in imaging, medical, and video industries. [Hierarchical\nstorage management](/wiki/Hierarchical_storage_management \"Hierarchical\nstorage management\") is a most known archiving strategy of automatically\n_migrating_ long-unused files from fast hard disk storage to libraries or\njukeboxes. If the files are needed, they are _retrieved_ back to disk.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[Computer memory](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_memory \"commons:Category:Computer memory\")**_.  \n---|---  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png) | Wikiversity has learning resources about _**[Computer data storage](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage \"v:Computer data storage\")**_  \n---|---  \n  \n### Primary storage\ntopics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Primary storage topics\")]\n\n  * [Aperture (computer memory)](/wiki/Aperture_\\(computer_memory\\) \"Aperture \\(computer memory\\)\")\n  * [Dynamic random-access memory](/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory \"Dynamic random-access memory\") (DRAM)\n  * [Memory latency](/wiki/CAS_latency \"CAS latency\")\n  * [Mass storage](/wiki/Mass_storage \"Mass storage\")\n  * [Memory cell (disambiguation)](/wiki/Memory_cell_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Memory cell \\(disambiguation\\)\")\n  * [Memory management](/wiki/Memory_management \"Memory management\")\n    * [Dynamic memory allocation](/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation \"Dynamic memory allocation\")\n      * [Memory leak](/wiki/Memory_leak \"Memory leak\")\n    * [Virtual memory](/wiki/Virtual_memory \"Virtual memory\")\n  * [Memory protection](/wiki/Memory_protection \"Memory protection\")\n  * [Page address register](/wiki/Page_address_register \"Page address register\")\n  * [Static random-access memory](/wiki/Static_random-access_memory \"Static random-access memory\") (SRAM)\n  * [Stable storage](/wiki/Stable_storage \"Stable storage\")\n\n### Secondary, tertiary and off-line storage\ntopics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Secondary, tertiary and off-line storage topics\")]\n\n  * [Cloud storage](/wiki/Cloud_storage \"Cloud storage\")\n  * [Data deduplication](/wiki/Data_deduplication \"Data deduplication\")\n  * [Data proliferation](/wiki/Data_proliferation \"Data proliferation\")\n  * [Data storage tag](/wiki/Data_storage_tag \"Data storage tag\") used for capturing research data\n  * [File system](/wiki/File_system \"File system\")\n    * [List of file formats](/wiki/List_of_file_formats \"List of file formats\")\n  * [Flash memory](/wiki/Flash_memory \"Flash memory\")\n  * [Information repository](/wiki/Information_repository \"Information repository\")\n  * [Removable media](/wiki/Removable_media \"Removable media\")\n  * [Solid-state drive](/wiki/Solid-state_drive \"Solid-state drive\")\n  * [Spindle](/wiki/Spindle_\\(computer\\) \"Spindle \\(computer\\)\")\n  * [Virtual tape library](/wiki/Virtual_tape_library \"Virtual tape library\")\n  * [Wait state](/wiki/Wait_state \"Wait state\")\n  * [Write buffer](/wiki/Write_buffer \"Write buffer\")\n  * [Write protection](/wiki/Write_protection \"Write protection\")\n  * [Noise-predictive maximum-likelihood detection](/wiki/Noise-predictive_maximum-likelihood_detection \"Noise-predictive maximum-likelihood detection\")\n  * [Object(-based) storage](/wiki/Object_storage \"Object storage\")\n\n### Data storage\nconferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Data storage conferences\")]\n\n  * [Storage Networking World](/wiki/Storage_Networking_World \"Storage Networking World\")\n  * [Storage World Conference](/wiki/Storage_World_Conference \"Storage World Conference\")\n  * [USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies](http://static.usenix.org/events/fast/)\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Computer_data_storage&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-\nicon.svg.png) This article incorporates [public domain\nmaterial](/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government \"Copyright\nstatus of work by the U.S. government\") from the [General Services\nAdministration](/wiki/General_Services_Administration \"General Services\nAdministration\") document [\"Federal Standard\n1037C\"](http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm).\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Patterson, David A.; Hennessy, John L.
