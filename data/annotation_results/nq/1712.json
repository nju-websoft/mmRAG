The group initially included future Florida Governor [Jeb\nBush](/wiki/Jeb_Bush \"Jeb Bush\") and Jacksonville developer [Tom\nPetway](/wiki/Tom_Petway \"Tom Petway\"), and came to be led by shoe magnate\n[Wayne Weaver](/wiki/Wayne_Weaver \"Wayne Weaver\"), founder of [Nine\nWest](/wiki/Nine_West \"Nine West\"). In 1991, the NFL announced plans to add\ntwo expansion teams in 1994 (later delayed until 1995), its first expansion\nsince the 1976 addition of the [Seattle Seahawks](/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks\n\"Seattle Seahawks\") and the [Tampa Bay Buccaneers](/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers\n\"Tampa Bay Buccaneers\"). Touchdown Jacksonville! announced its bid for a team,\nand Jacksonville was ultimately chosen as one of five finalists, along with\n[Charlotte](/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina \"Charlotte, North Carolina\"), [St.\nLouis](/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri \"St. Louis, Missouri\"),\n[Baltimore](/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland \"Baltimore, Maryland\"), and\n[Memphis](/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee \"Memphis, Tennessee\").[8]\n\nJacksonville was considered the least likely expansion candidate for several\nreasons. The [Jacksonville metropolitan\narea](/wiki/Jacksonville_metropolitan_area \"Jacksonville metropolitan area\")\nand television market were smaller than those of nearly every team in the\nleague.[8] Although Jacksonville was the 15th largest city in the nation at\nthe time (It has since grown to become the 11th-largest), it has always been a\nmedium-sized market because the surrounding suburbs and rural areas are far\nsmaller than the city itself. There were 635,000 people in Jacksonville proper\naccording to the 1990 census, but only 900,000 people in the metropolitan\narea.[9][10] Additionally, the Gator Bowl was outdated, and the ownership\ngroup struggled to negotiate a lease with the city. The troubled negotiations\nover the Gator Bowl lease led the ownership group to withdraw from the NFL\nexpansion bidding in July 1993.[8]\n\nCharlotte was awarded the first franchise – the [Carolina\nPanthers](/wiki/Carolina_Panthers \"Carolina Panthers\") – in October 1993.\nSurprisingly, the naming of the second expansion city was delayed a month.\nMost pundits speculated that the delay was made to allow St. Louis to shore up\nits bid. At the time, St. Louis was considered the favorite for the second\nfranchise, with Baltimore's three bids also considered strong. However, in a\nsurprising move, the NFL owners voted 26–2 in favor of awarding the 30th\nfranchise to Jacksonville.[8]\n\nAfter the Gator Bowl game on December 31, 1993, the old stadium was\nessentially demolished and replaced with a reinforced concrete superstructure.\nAll that remained of the old stadium was the west upper concourse and a\nportion of the ramping system.[11] To accommodate construction, the 1994 and\n1995 games of \"The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party\" were split between\nthe home fields of Florida and Georgia, and the [1994 Gator\nBowl](/wiki/1994_Gator_Bowl \"1994 Gator Bowl\") was played at [Ben Hill Griffin\nStadium](/wiki/Ben_Hill_Griffin_Stadium \"Ben Hill Griffin Stadium\") in\n[Gainesville](/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida \"Gainesville, Florida\").[12]\n\n###\n1995–2002[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacksonville_Jaguars&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1995–2002\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Army.Coughlin.jpg/220px-\nArmy.Coughlin.jpg)](/wiki/File:Army.Coughlin.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Army.Coughlin.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Tom Coughlin](/wiki/Tom_Coughlin \"Tom Coughlin\") was Jacksonville's head\ncoach for its first eight seasons\n\nIn January 1994 [Wayne Weaver](/wiki/Wayne_Weaver \"Wayne Weaver\") chose [Tom\nCoughlin](/wiki/Tom_Coughlin \"Tom Coughlin\") as the first-ever head coach of\nthe Jaguars. Coughlin had worked in the NFL as a position coach, but he had\nbeen neither a head coach nor a coordinator in the NFL.[13]\n\nThe Jaguars' hiring of Coughlin contrasted with the hiring moves made by their\nfellow expansion team. The same month that Weaver hired Coughlin as his head\n_coach_ , [Carolina Panthers](/wiki/Carolina_Panthers \"Carolina Panthers\")\nowner [Jerry Richardson](/wiki/Jerry_Richardson \"Jerry Richardson\") went a\nmore conventional route and hired former [Buffalo Bills](/wiki/Buffalo_Bills\n\"Buffalo Bills\") general manager [Bill Polian](/wiki/Bill_Polian \"Bill\nPolian\") as the Panthers' first GM (the Panthers' head coach, [Dom\nCapers](/wiki/Dom_Capers \"Dom Capers\"), would not be hired until a full year\nafter Coughlin). As it emerged that Weaver had no intention of hiring a\ngeneral manager, it became apparent that Coughlin would have most of the\nauthority regarding hiring decisions. Coughlin spent his year as \"head coach\nwithout a team\"[13] preparing for the personnel moves that would come from the\nexpansion draft, free agency, and the rookie draft in the spring of 1995.\n\n#### 1995[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacksonville_Jaguars&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 1995\")]\n\nMain article: [1995 Jacksonville Jaguars\nseason](/wiki/1995_Jacksonville_Jaguars_season \"1995 Jacksonville Jaguars\nseason\")\n\n[![A david\ngarrard.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b6/JaguarsInauguralSeasonlogo.gif/215px-\nJaguarsInauguralSeasonlogo.gif)](/wiki/File:JaguarsInauguralSeasonlogo.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:JaguarsInauguralSeasonlogo.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe inaugural logo of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nAlong with the [Carolina Panthers](/wiki/Carolina_Panthers \"Carolina\nPanthers\"), the Jacksonville Jaguars entered the [NFL](/wiki/NFL \"NFL\") as the\nfirst expansion teams in almost 20 years.

Despite being a heavy\nunderdog, the Jaguars won 30–27, and knocked Buffalo quarterback [Jim\nKelly](/wiki/Jim_Kelly \"Jim Kelly\") out of what would turn out to be the last\ngame of his career.

On June 15, 2007, the Jaguars\nreleased veteran strong safety [Donovin Darius](/wiki/Donovin_Darius \"Donovin\nDarius\"), who had seen diminished playing time in previous years due to\nmounting injuries. On August 31, 2007, the Jaguars announced that long time\nback-up quarterback [David Garrard](/wiki/David_Garrard \"David Garrard\") would\nstart for the team, ahead of former first round draft pick [Byron\nLeftwich](/wiki/Byron_Leftwich \"Byron Leftwich\"), who was released in the\nteam's final roster cuts.

[Tom Brady](/wiki/Tom_Brady \"Tom Brady\") completed 26 of 28 passes\nin this game, being pressured by the Jaguars' defense only once, on the first\nplay. This game, more than any other, gave the Jaguars' front office a strong\ndesire to upgrade the pass rush during the offseason.\n\nThe team's offense in 2007 was largely a run-first offense, with [Maurice\nJones-Drew](/wiki/Maurice_Jones-Drew \"Maurice Jones-Drew\") and [Fred\nTaylor](/wiki/Fred_Taylor_\\(American_football\\) \"Fred Taylor \\(American\nfootball\\)\") each putting up a lot of yards.

(Porter was\nreleased the following year and Groves was traded to Oakland in 2010.)\nJournalists including ESPN.com's Kevin Seifert predicted the Jaguars were\npoised to make a Super Bowl run.[33]\n\nHowever, the Jaguars failed to live up to those expectations, struggling to a\n5–11 finish, the franchise's worst record since 2003. The team's struggles\nwere in part, the result of a rash of injuries to the team's offensive line.\nThe Jaguars lost starting guards [Vince Manuwai](/wiki/Vince_Manuwai \"Vince\nManuwai\") and [Maurice Williams](/wiki/Maurice_Williams_\\(offensive_tackle\\)\n\"Maurice Williams \\(offensive tackle\\)\") for the season within the first\nquarter of the opening game. Tackle [Richard Collier](/wiki/Richard_Collier\n\"Richard Collier\")'s career ended in early September when he was brutally\nattacked and shot 14 times.[34] Center Brad Meester missed the first two\nmonths of the season and guard Chris Naeole, signed to the roster mid-season\nin response to these injuries, was injured in pregame warmups before playing a\nsingle snap. The 2008 season marked the end of running back [Fred\nTaylor](/wiki/Fred_Taylor_\\(American_football\\) \"Fred Taylor \\(American\nfootball\\)\")'s 11-year career as a Jaguar. Taylor, who is considered to be one\nof the greatest Jaguars in the history of the franchise, rushed for over\n10,000 yards during his tenure with Jacksonville and earned one trip to the\n[Pro Bowl](/wiki/Pro_Bowl \"Pro Bowl\"). In 2009, he signed with the [New\nEngland Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\"). Taylor's\ndeparture opened up the door for [Maurice Jones-Drew](/wiki/Maurice_Jones-Drew\n\"Maurice Jones-Drew\") to become the team's feature running back.

From 2008 the team further suffered from the [late-2000s\nrecession](/wiki/Late-2000s_recession \"Late-2000s recession\"), which hit\nFlorida particularly hard, and structural changes within the NFL that\ndisadvantage teams in smaller markets.[36]\n\nIn 2010, to address this issue, the team and the City of Jacksonville\nundertook several measures aimed at ensuring the franchise's continued\nviability in Jacksonville. Supporters began the \"Team Teal\" drive to drum up\nticket sales.[40][41] The city negotiated a five-year, $16.6 million naming\nrights deal with Jacksonville-based [EverBank](/wiki/EverBank \"EverBank\") to\nrename the stadium [EverBank Field](/wiki/EverBank_Field \"EverBank\nField\").[36][42] As a result, the Jaguars' attendance increased dramatically\nin 2010.

The team's colors were to be teal, gold,\nand silver with black accents. However, this jersey and helmet design, with a\ngold leaping jaguar, created controversy. [Ford Motor\nCompany](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford Motor Company\"), then-parent of the\nautomaker [Jaguar](/wiki/Jaguar_\\(car\\) \"Jaguar \\(car\\)\"), believed that the\nJaguars' logo bore too much resemblance to the automaker's logo. Though no\nlawsuit was brought to trial, lawyers from the team and the automaker\nnegotiated an ultimately amicable agreement whereby Jaguar would be named the\nofficial car of the Jaguars, and the Jaguars would redesign their uniforms.\n\nThe new logo was a snarling jaguar head with a teal tongue, which Weaver said\nwas his wife's touch. He also claimed that the teal tongue came from \"feeding\nPanthers to our Jaguars\" — an obvious jab at [their expansion\nbrethren](/wiki/Carolina_Panthers \"Carolina Panthers\"). During the Jaguars'\nfirst ever preseason game teal-colored candies were handed out to all the fans\nwho attended, turning their tongues a teal color just like on the logo.\nAdditionally, raspberry lollipops were handed out by the \"Candy Man\" in\nsection 142 to also turn the home fans' tongues teal.\n\nIn 2009, Weaver announced that he wanted to 'clean up' the team's image. This\nmeant the elimination of the full-body crawling Jaguar logo, the clawing\nJaguar, and the two previous wordmarks which bent the text around these logos.\n\nIn February 2013, Jaguars owner [Shahid Khan](/wiki/Shahid_Khan \"Shahid\nKhan\"), who had acquired the team in late 2011, introduced a new brand\nidentity for the team that included a new logo, wordmark, and secondary logo.\nThe new [Jaguar](/wiki/Jaguar \"Jaguar\") head logo was intended to be \"fiercer\"\nand more realistic.[79] The secondary logo incorporated the new Jaguar head\nlogo along with the first official usage of the team's popular nickname\n\"Jags\". The two images were incased in a shield-style shape, designed to be a\ntribute to Jacksonville's military community.[2]\n\nBeginning in 2013, the Jaguars began to feature gold more prominently than in\nthe past.

The only exceptions were in 2004 and\n2008–10, when the Jaguars chose to wear teal for all home games. In the\npreseason, the Jaguars typically wear teal at home since these games are\nplayed at night when there is very little advantage with the heat.\n\n####\n1995–2001[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacksonville_Jaguars&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: 1995–2001\")]\n\nFollowing the logo change, the redesigned uniforms featured an all-black\nhelmet, white pants with teal, black, and gold stripes, and numbers with gold\ninner trim and black outer trim. The home jersey was teal with white numbers\nand the away jersey was white with teal numbers. Both jerseys had a black\ncollar and no sleeve stripes.\n\nA prowling jaguar on each sleeve replaced the leaping jaguar going across both\nshoulders in the original design. The Jaguars in 1995 were the first NFL team\nto have 2-tone borders on their numbers and lettering, and the first NFL team\nto show a complex logo (the crawling Jaguar) on the sleeve.\n\nMinor modifications were introduced to the Jaguars uniform during this time,\nmost notably the font of the jersey numbers, replacing the original block\nnumbers with a unique font. Two stripes were also added to the end of the\nsleeves below the prowling jaguar.\n\n####\n2002–2008[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacksonville_Jaguars&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: 2002–2008\")]\n\nDuring this period, the Jaguars made minor changes to their uniform, each time\nadding more black to the look.\n\nThe team introduced a black alternate jersey in 2002. During that same year,\nthe team also introduced alternate black pants, worn with either the white or\nthe teal jersey. After the black pants were introduced, the white pants would\nonly be seen for the first few games of the year, presumably due to the heat.\nThe black pants originally included two teal stripes down each side. The fan\nreaction to the extra black in the alternate jersey and alternate pants was\npositive, so in 2004 the Jaguars went through a formal uniform change, which\nteams are only allowed to do once every five years. These changes were mostly\nto the away look. Before 2004, the white away jerseys had teal numbers with\nblack and gold trim, but after, the white jerseys had black numbers with teal\nand gold trim. The black pants were also changed. The teal stripes were\nreplaced with the Jaguar logo on each hip. Teal almost disappeared from the\naway uniform.\n\nThe stripes on the white pants were altered in 2008 so that the center,\nthickest stripe was black, and its accents were teal. In the 2008 year, the\ngold in the uniforms noticeably shifted from a bright yellow metallic\nappearance to more beige.\n\n####\n2009–2011[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacksonville_Jaguars&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: 2009–2011\")]\n\nThe Jaguars unveiled new uniforms for the [2009\nseason](/wiki/2009_Jacksonville_Jaguars_season \"2009 Jacksonville Jaguars\nseason\").[15][80] Team owner [Wayne Weaver](/wiki/Wayne_Weaver \"Wayne Weaver\")\nreportedly wanted to \"clean up\" the look, feeling that the team had too many\nuniform styles.[15] The new uniforms were introduced in a press conference on\nApril 22.[81]\n\nAt this press conference, Weaver elaborated that different people had taken\ndifferent liberties with the Jaguars' image over the years, singling out the\n'All Black' look which the team wore for every prime-time home game from 2003\nto 2007 as a point of regret. He also said that the team would wear their teal\njerseys at home even on hot days, saying that the practice of choosing to wear\nwhite on hot days had also diluted the team's image. The new uniform reflected\na simpler look overall. The collar and sleeve ends are the same color as the\nrest of the jersey. The crawling jaguar was removed. The numbers on the\njerseys were changed to a simpler, block font with a thicker, single color\nborder. After all of these subtractions, two features were added. The first\nwas a \"JAGUARS\" wordmark underneath the NFL insignia on the chest. The second\nwas two thin 'stripes' of off-color fabric which were added to each midseam of\nthe jersey, curling up to the neckline on the front and below the number on\nthe back. The stripe on the home jersey is a white line next to a black line,\nmatching the color of the numbers, and the stripe on the away jersey is a\nblack line next to a teal line, again matching the numbers. The pants have\nsimilar stripes, both for the home and away uniform. The away uniforms were\nstill black pants and numbers on a white jersey, but they now used teal as the\nonly accent color as opposed to using gold in previous years. The Jaguars'\nidentity, in terms of colors, beginning in 2009 is exclusively teal and black,\nwith gold only being used in the logo. The final change made to the Jaguars'\nuniforms in 2009 was to the helmet. The new helmet and facemask were black\njust like the old ones, but when light hit the new ones a certain way, both\nthe helmet and face mask sparkled with a shiny teal appearance. These were the\nfirst helmets in professional football which changed color with different\nangles of light.
