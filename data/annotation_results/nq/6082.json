Women are divided into a small range of\nsocial categories, each one signified by a [plain dress](/wiki/Plain_dress\n\"Plain dress\") in a specific color: Handmaids wear red, Marthas (who are\nhousekeepers and cooks, named after [the biblical figure](/wiki/Martha\n\"Martha\")) wear green, and Wives (who are expected to run their households)\nwear blue and turquoise.\n\nEconowives, the lower-class women who still have minimal agency, are a sort of\nmixture of all these categories, and they wear gray (a departure from the book\nin which Econowives wear clothing striped with the aforementioned colors).\nWomen prisoners are called Unwomen and are worked to death clearing toxic\nwaste in the Colonies.\n\nAnother class of women, Aunts (who train and oversee the Handmaids), wear\nbrown. Additionally, the Eyes are a secret police watching over the general\npopulace for signs of rebellion, Hunters track down people attempting to flee\nthe country, and Jezebels are prostitutes in secret brothels catering to the\nelite ruling class.\n\nJune Osborne, renamed Offred ([Elisabeth Moss](/wiki/Elisabeth_Moss \"Elisabeth\nMoss\")), is the Handmaid assigned to the home of the Gileadan Commander Fred\nWaterford ([Joseph Fiennes](/wiki/Joseph_Fiennes \"Joseph Fiennes\")) and his\nwife Serena Joy ([Yvonne Strahovski](/wiki/Yvonne_Strahovski \"Yvonne\nStrahovski\")). Offred is subject to strict rules and constant scrutiny; an\nimproper word or deed on her part can lead to brutal punishment.\n\nOffred, who is named after her male master (\"Of Fred\") like all Handmaids, can\nremember the \"time before\", when she was married and had a daughter, a job, a\nbank account, and her own name and identity, but all she can safely do now is\nfollow the rules of Gilead in hopes that she can someday live free again and\nbe reunited with her daughter. The Waterfords, key players in the rise of\nGilead, have their own conflicts with the realities of the society they have\nhelped create.\n\n## Cast and\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast and characters\")]\n\nMain article: [List of The Handmaid's Tale\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_characters \"List of The\nHandmaid's Tale characters\")\n\n###\nMain[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Main\")]\n\n  * [Elisabeth Moss](/wiki/Elisabeth_Moss \"Elisabeth Moss\") as June Osborne / Offred, a woman who was captured while attempting to escape to Canada with her husband, Luke, and daughter, Hannah.

She is desperate to become a mother.\n  * [Alexis Bledel](/wiki/Alexis_Bledel \"Alexis Bledel\") as Emily / Ofglen / Ofsteven, June's shopping partner. Although June is initially wary of her, it is revealed Ofglen is not as pious as she seems, and the two become friends. Ofglen had a wife and son, and was a university lecturer in cellular biology.

Fagbenle\") as Lucas \"Luke\" Bankole, June's husband from before Gilead. Because he and June began their relationship before his divorce from his first wife, their union is considered invalid in the new society.

She initially follows the rules and does not wish to upset the status quo, but this is because she believes her life as a Handmaid is better than the difficult, impoverished life she led prior to Gilead, rather than out of religious piety.\n  * Nina Kiri as Alma / Ofrobert, another Handmaid who trained at the Red Center with June, Moira, and Janine. She is frank and chatty, and often trades gossip and news with June.

The woman is caught, and\nseparated from her young daughter and husband as shots are fired in the\ndistance. She is now known as Offred, the Handmaid to Commander Fred\nWaterford. While walking with another Handmaid, Ofglen, they pass by a wall on\nwhich men have been hanged for crimes such as being gay, working in an\nabortion clinic, and being a Catholic priest.[17] In a flashback, various\nwomen are indoctrinated into their Handmaid roles by Aunt Lydia, and Offred\nnotices Moira, a woman she knew in college. Handmaid Janine taunts Aunt Lydia\nand is shocked with a cattle prod, later her right eye is removed as\npunishment. In the present, Commander Waterford tries to impregnate Offred\nduring \"the Ceremony\" as she lies in the lap of his wife, Serena Joy. The next\nday, the Handmaids are encouraged to beat a man to death after Lydia announces\nhe raped a pregnant Handmaid. Janine tells Offred that her friend Moira is\ndead. On the way home, Ofglen tells Offred that she had a wife and son, and\nwarns her there is an Eye in the Waterford house. Offred affirms to herself\nthat her true name is June and that she intends to survive to find her\ndaughter.  \n2| 2| \"Birth Day\"| Reed Morano| Bruce Miller| April 26, 2017 (2017-04-26)  \nOffred and Ofglen go shopping, and they reveal more personal information about\nthemselves to each other.

When Offred asks how Ofglen knows this information, she reveals that\nshe is part of a resistance movement against the government, but Offred\ndeclines to join.[19] Commander Waterford's driver, Nick, tells Offred that\nthe Commander wants to see her alone later that night, which is forbidden, and\nwarns her that Ofglen is dangerous. Offred and other Handmaids visit a home to\nwitness the birth of Ofwarren (Janine)'s child, named Angela by the Puttnams,\nbut Charlotte by Ofwarren. In flashbacks, June (Offred) remembers the birth of\nher and Luke's daughter, Hannah. At that time healthy births were already\nrare, and a woman who tried to kidnap baby Hannah was arrested. Warily, Offred\ngoes to the Commander's office, but he just wants to play\n_[Scrabble](/wiki/Scrabble \"Scrabble\")_ , to her relief. The next day, when\nOffred prepares to tell Ofglen what happened that night, a different woman\nintroduces herself as Ofglen.  \n3| 3| \"Late\"| Reed Morano| Bruce Miller| April 26, 2017 (2017-04-26)  \nIn flashbacks, the rise of Gilead is detailed. June and all the other women at\nher office were fired, and the government froze women's bank accounts and\nruled they could no longer own property. In the present, Serena takes Offred\nto see Ofwarren and the baby, and Offred fears Ofwarren is delusional. Back\nhome, Offred is interrogated by an Eye and Aunt Lydia about her knowledge of\nOfglen. Offred eventually reveals she knew Ofglen was gay and for this, Aunt\nLydia shocks Offred with a cattle prod. Before she can leave the room, Offred\nquotes one of the [Beatitudes](/wiki/Beatitudes \"Beatitudes\") from the\n[Bible](/wiki/Bible \"Bible\"), which would have earned her a much more serious\nbeating, but Serena intervenes, believing that Offred is pregnant. When Offred\nlater tells Serena that she's not pregnant, Serena angrily locks her in her\nroom. In a flashback, June and Moira attend a protest against the new laws\namidst automatic gunfire and explosives. In the present, Ofglen and the Martha\nshe's in a relationship with are charged with \"gender treachery\". The fertile\nOfglen receives a lesser sentence, but the Martha is executed by hanging as\nOfglen watches, sobbing and horrified.

When Rita, the Commander's housekeeper, finds Offred\nlying on the closet floor, Offred tells her that she fainted. Serena then has\nOffred sent to the hospital for a check-up. During the examination the\nphysician remarks that the Commander is most likely sterile, as is common. He\noffers to personally impregnate her but she declines. In flashbacks, Aunt\nLydia teaches the Handmaids about The Ceremony in which a Commander endeavours\nto fertilize a Handmaid. Later, June and Moira assault Aunt Elizabeth, and\nMoira takes Elizabeth's outfit. June and Moira plan to escape via train to\nBoston, which has safe houses. Moira manages to catch the train without June,\nwho lets Moira know it's okay. June is later caught and punished by having her\n[feet whipped](/wiki/Foot_whipping \"Foot whipping\"). Commander Waterford has\nan unsuccessful Ceremony night with Offred, but later that night, they have\nanother game of _Scrabble_. She asks him about the Latin phrase, and he tells\nher it means, _Don 't let the bastards grind you down_.

In their\nensuing conversation, the Commander admits that while they thought they were\nbuilding a better world, they knew that \"better never means better for\neveryone.\" Nick reveals to Offred that he is indeed an Eye. At an open-air\nmarket, Offred questions Ofsteven about the resistance group called Mayday.\nOfsteven jumps behind the steering wheel of a security car and drives\nerratically around the plaza.

She reluctantly\nobeys his demand to kiss him, but ferociously brushes her teeth afterward. The\nHandmaids and children are then taken to a function to demonstrate Gilead's\nsuccess. Offred's friend remarks that the delegates are only interested in\nfertile women. The next day, as the delegates are leaving, Offred tells them\nthe brutal truth about Gilead. She pleads for their help, but in response, the\nMexican ambassador explains her own country's dire situation. However, the\nambassador's assistant quietly claims June's husband is alive and that he can\ndeliver a message to Luke.

This is\nGilead. No one gets out.\" Offred reveals to Moira that she knows Luke is\nalive. Flashbacks detail how Nick got involved with the Gilead movement and\nhow he became an Eye after reporting a Commander for breaking protocol with\nhis Handmaids.

Offred convinces Waterford to take her to Jezebel's again\nthat night. After Offred and Waterford have sex in their room, Waterford\npresents Moira, as he believes they have a sexual attraction.

The next day Offred is taken to a bridge where Ofdaniel is standing on\nthe edge with baby Charlotte, while Gileadan guards, the Putnams, the\nWaterfords, and Aunt Lydia stand fearfully by. Ofdaniel shouts that Commander\nPutnam promised to leave his wife for her. Offred convinces Ofdaniel to give\nher the child, and Ofdaniel then jumps into the icy water below. Later, while\nOfdaniel lies comatose in hospital, Commander Putnam is led away by guards.\nWhen Serena Joy tries to offer comfort to Mrs. Putnam, she reminds Serena of\nthe first Offred's fate, causing Serena to doubt her husband's loyalty.

Later, an emotional\nAunt Lydia gathers the Handmaids for the execution of Janine/Ofdaniel. The\nHandmaids hesitate, and Ofglen No. 2 is brutally beaten when she voices her\nangry refusal. Offred, then the other Handmaids, drop their stones. The guards\nprepare to kill them all, but Aunt Lydia saves them, although assuring them\nthat there will be consequences. Not long afterward, a black van comes for\nOffred. Nick urges her to trust him and go with them.

During another punishment, Offred is\nfreed after Aunt Lydia is told of her pregnancy. When she rejects a meal Aunt\nLydia gives her, she is shown a pregnant handmaid, Ofwyatt, chained in a\nprison room due to her attempt to kill herself with drain cleaner. Offred\nagrees to eat, and during her meal Aunt Lydia, who had told her that her\nfriends would be punished for their disobedience but her pregnancy would mean\nthat she would be exempted, brings the other handmaids into the room, and one\nby one they are burned with a gas flame. Later, Offred is at a pregnancy\ncheck-up, where she is visited by Fred and Serena, but afterwards finds a key\nin one of her boots, which she uses to escape to a van parked underneath the\nhospital. The van drops her off to a safe house in [Back\nBay](/wiki/Back_Bay,_Boston \"Back Bay, Boston\") where she meets Nick, while\nFred authorizes a highly resourced search for her.

A commander's wife\narrives at the Colonies and is not welcomed by the unwomen: Emily befriends\nher and finds that she was taken to the colonies for committing a \"sin of the\nflesh\". Emily gives her tablets that turn out to be poison, which leads to her\ndeath. Emily blames her for \"holding a woman down while her husband rapes\nher\".[25] The unwomen are warned that there will be consequences for this\ndeath. Janine arrives at the Colonies, where she is briefly greeted by Emily.\nNick visits June and she gets upset when he tells her she needs to wait for\nseveral weeks before she can leave because everyone is looking for her. Nick\nends up giving her the keys to a car and a gun but she decides to stay, and\nthey have sex. In a flashback, after the attack on the Capitol Building and\nthe White House, Emily is told by her boss, Professor Dan, that she will not\nbe teaching the following semester at the university, giving her a lower\nprofile to avoid attracting criticism for her sexual orientation. Professor\nDan is later seen hanged at the university with the word \"faggot\" spray\npainted underneath him. While Emily, along with her wife Sylvia and son\nOliver, attempt to emigrate to [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\"), she is unable\nto leave the country because their same-sex marriage is no longer recognized,\nand it becomes known that she is the biological mother of Oliver. June makes a\nmemorial for _The Boston Globe_ employees who were executed at the newspaper's\nformer headquarters and [prays](/wiki/Christian_prayer \"Christian prayer\") to\nGod to send an angel to watch over it.[25]  \n13| 3| \"Baggage\"| [Kari Skogland](/wiki/Kari_Skogland \"Kari Skogland\")|\nDorothy Fortenberry| May 2, 2018 (2018-05-02)  \nHaving spent two months at _The Boston Globe_ offices, June has found evidence\nin their archives of the early emergence of the Gilead movement.

He takes her to his apartment, where she meets his wife, Heather,\nand their son, Adam. Left alone when his family goes to church, June finds a\nhidden [Qur'an](/wiki/Qur%27an \"Qur'an\") and [prayer rug](/wiki/Prayer_rug\n\"Prayer rug\") under the bedsprings; Omar and his family do not return. She\ndons Heather's Econowife outfit and gets out of the apartment, blending in\nwith other Econowives. After a train ride, June runs into the woods.

Moira and June learned\nduring their training at the Red Center that Holly had been declared an\nUnwoman and was sent to the Colonies to be worked to death.  \n14| 4| \"Other Women\"| Kari Skogland| Yahlin Chang| May 9, 2018 (2018-05-09)  \nJune is taken back and chained in a room where Aunt Lydia explains that she\nmust choose between this imprisonment, followed by execution after the birth\nof her child, or return as a handmaid to the Waterfords. She chooses the\nlatter and is under close supervision from Lydia.

She notices vaginal bleeding, which continues and gets worse but\ndoes not inform anyone, although Rita notices her unsteadiness. Nick notices\nOffred's apparent depression and lets Mrs. Waterford know about it. Mrs.\nWaterford becomes alarmed at Nick's interest in Offred and informs Commander\nWaterford, who arranges for him to be married at a Prayvaganza where loyal\nGuardians are issued a wife as a reward for their work. Nick's new bride,\nEden, moves into his room. Nick later finds Offred unconscious and drenched in\nthe bushes outside the Waterfords' house and she is taken to the hospital.\nOffred, still pregnant, promises to her baby that they both will escape\nGilead. Meanwhile, in the Colonies, Janine assures Emily that God is\nprotecting them through their struggles in Gilead, and helps to arrange a\nsmall wedding for a dying worker, officiated by another Unwoman who is a\n[rabbi](/wiki/Rabbi \"Rabbi\"). Emily, who has begun to lose her teeth, argues\nwith her for wishing to bring brightness to a place that otherwise seems so\nbleak. When the newlywed Unwoman dies, the rabbi officiates at the burial as\nshe is lowered into her grave in a [cemetery](/wiki/Cemetery \"Cemetery\")\nadorned with crosses.  \n16| 6| \"First Blood\"| Mike Barker| Eric Tuchman| May 23, 2018 (2018-05-23)  \nAdvised by a doctor that a harmonious household would be good for the child,\nSerena shows increased care for Offred, giving her the sitting room as a\nbedroom and inviting some handmaids to have lunch with her. When Serena shows\nOffred the nursery for the baby, Offred asks to see Hannah, upon which Serena\nmoves her back to her previous room, and sets about humiliating her. Eden\nreveals to Offred that she fears Nick may be a \"gender traitor\" due to his\nreluctance to have sex with her, so Offred warns him and he has sex with Eden\nto avoid suspicion, but only after he tells Offred that he loves her. Fred\nvisits Offred in secret and gives her a photograph of Hannah, and wants to\nhave sex with her, but Offred refuses. At the opening of the Rachel and Leah\nCenter, a construction and ceremony overseen by Waterford, Nick asks Commander\nPryce to be reassigned, and that Offred be protected, to which he agrees.\nOfglen runs toward the stage, and detonates a bomb: only Handmaids are seen to\nhave escaped. Flashbacks show Serena being verbally attacked while promoting\nher book _A Woman 's Place_, and being shot by a protester, and Fred's\npunishment of those he believes to have been involved.  \n17| 7| \"After\"| Kari Skogland| Lynn Renee Maxcy| May 30, 2018 (2018-05-30)  \n31 handmaids and 26 commanders, and an unspecified number of civilians, have\nbeen killed in Ofglen's attack on the Rachel and Leah Center, including\nCommander Pryce, while others, such as Commander Waterford, were seriously\ninjured. Following the attack, Commander Cushing takes Commander Pryce's role,\ninstituting an increased number of checkpoints and having numerous people\nsummarily executed. He questions Offred, asking who aided her when she tried\nto flee the country. Offred responds that she was kidnapped, an answer that\nCommander Cushing does not believe. Mrs. Waterford is alarmed at the\npossibility of her household being targeted, and is angry at his heavy-handed\nresponse to the bombing. She forges orders from her husband to have Commander\nCushing arrested for treason and apostasy. Because so many handmaids were\nkilled, some fertile women are taken back from the Colonies and are made to\nserve as handmaids once again, including Janine and Emily. Both reunite with\nOffred in the grocery store, with Janine happily telling her that it was God's\nplan that she be rescued. Offred, who had been sad to discover that none of\nthe handmaids had known Ofglen's name, tells her real name, June, to Emily and\nanother handmaid and following this, several of the handmaids whisper their\nreal names to one another, which Eden overhears. Later, Mrs. Waterford enlists\nOffred's help in illicitly performing the Commander's work for him while he is\nin the hospital. At the refugee center, Moira looks through records to try to\nconfirm whether her fiancée, Odette, has died. Through flashbacks Moira is\nrevealed to have been a surrogate for a couple before the war. She met Odette,\na doctor, during this process.

Serena tells June that the Putnams'\nchild, Angela, (called Charlotte by Janine, who is her biological mother) is\nsick. June advocates for Janine to be able to see the baby, and Serena agrees\nto ask about it for the baby's sake. Naomi Putnam dislikes the idea, but she\nis overruled by her husband, Warren. Serena petitions Fred to allow the sick\nchild to be seen by a Martha who, prior to the Sons of Jacob coup, was one of\nthe nation's top [neonatologists](/wiki/Neonatology \"Neonatology\"). Fred\ndenies the request, saying that whatever happens to the child must now be left\nto God's will. A dismayed Serena forges Fred's signature to a written order\nthat transfers the Martha to the hospital for a day. Aunt Lydia tells June\nthat she will hold her personally responsible if anything goes wrong with\nJanine's visit to the hospital. The neonatologist can find nothing physically\nwrong with the child, and she advises them to simply unplug the baby from all\nof the machines and help her to feel safe and warm. When Fred discovers that\nSerena forged his signature on an order to temporarily transfer the\nphysician/Martha, he beats Serena with his belt as June is forced to watch.\nSerena later tearfully rejects June's offer of sympathy. Meanwhile, Eden is\nworking hard to please Nick, but after she rearranges his garret and uncovers\nthe bundle of handmaids' letters he recovered from June, he becomes angry,\ndemanding that she never touch his belongings.

Later, Serena is approached by Mark Tuello, who works for\nthe remnant of the US government in [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\"), and\noffers to help Serena defect from Gilead, but Serena declines. As Offred and\nJanine are walking, Janine objects loudly to Offred's news that she is to be\ndismissed: Isaac hits her with his rifle butt, and brings Offred back to the\nhouse without shopping.[27] At a protest, Luke confronts Commander Waterford.\nAfterwards, Nick finds Luke and tells him June is pregnant by Waterford, but\nsafe, and gives him the bundle of letters from women enslaved in Gilead. Luke,\nMoira, and Erin make the letters public, causing an outcry that prompts the\nCanadians to cancel the rest of the summit. Moira holds a sign up to the\nWaterfords' car that says \"My name is Moira\" and Fred recognises her from\nJezebel's. June pleads with Rita, and then with Aunt Lydia, to protect her\nchild from the Waterfords when she is expelled from the house. Nick gives June\nnews of Luke and Moira, and tells her that the letters were instrumental in\ngetting the talks curtailed: he tells her he loves her, and tries to kiss her,\nbut she does not allow him to.  \n20| 10| \"The Last Ceremony\"| Jeremy Podeswa| Yahlin Chang| June 20, 2018\n(2018-06-20)  \nEmily begins her new life as a handmaiden for a new commander, her spirit\nbroken by the experiences in the Colonies.

Later, Fred rapes\nJune with Serena holding her down, under the guise of inducing the labor. Eden\nfinds herself attracted to Isaac, a guard, and meets with him late at night.\nThey kiss, but she breaks off once she sees Nick watching.
