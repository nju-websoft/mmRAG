The name, which\nalters \"poodle\" to \"doodle\" by analogy to \"[Labradoodle](/wiki/Labradoodle\n\"Labradoodle\")\", was coined in 1992.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Appearance\n    * 2.1 Shedding\n    * 2.2 Coat\n  * 3 Breed status\n  * 4 Health\n  * 5 Usage\n  * 6 References\n    * 6.1 Citations\n    * 6.2 Bibliography\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Goldendoodle&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nThe Goldendoodle was first bred by [Monica Dickens](/wiki/Monica_Dickens\n\"Monica Dickens\") in 1969.[1] Popularity for the goldendoodle grew in the\n1990s[2] when breeders in North America and Australia began crossing Golden\nRetrievers with Standard Poodles.[3] The original purpose of the cross was to\ndevelop guide dogs suitable for visually impaired individuals with allergies.\nPoodles are considered to be [hypoallergenic](/wiki/Hypoallergenic\n\"Hypoallergenic\"). Their coats do not shed, which reduces\n[dander](/wiki/Dander \"Dander\").[4] Dander is a protein that sheds from the\nskin and causes allergies in humans.\n\nThe goldendoodle is referred to as a [designer dog](/wiki/Designer_dog\n\"Designer dog\"). The [Encyclopædia\nBritannica](/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica \"Encyclopædia Britannica\")\ntraces the term \"designer dog\" to the late 20th century when breeders began to\ncross purebred [Poodles](/wiki/Poodle \"Poodle\") with other purebred breeds in\norder to obtain a dog with the poodle's non-shedding coat, along with various\ndesirable characteristics from other breeds.[5] In regards to goldendoodles,\ngolden retrievers are considered a great family dog,[6] which is why they have\nbeen used to cross breed with poodles.\n\n## Appearance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Goldendoodle&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Appearance\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/2770692200812301939581Goldendoodle_pup_7_weeks_old.jpg/220px-2770692200812301939581Goldendoodle_pup_7_weeks_old.jpg)](/wiki/File:2770692200812301939581Goldendoodle_pup_7_weeks_old.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2770692200812301939581Goldendoodle_pup_7_weeks_old.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nGoldendoodle puppy at 6 weeks old--the coat starts out quite flat and becomes\nmore curly as the puppy grows older\n\n### Shedding[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Goldendoodle&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Shedding\")]\n\nAlthough not all goldendoodles exhibit the hypoallergenic coat type of the\n[Standard Poodle](/wiki/Standard_Poodle \"Standard Poodle\"), most goldendoodles\ndo have a low to non-shedding coat.[3] While the degree of shedding varies\nfrom dog to dog, overall, the goldendoodle exhibits less shedding than other\ndogs. Grooming requirements include regular brushing, occasional bathing and\nsome fur trimming. Due to minimal shedding, Goldendoodles tend to have less\n[dander](/wiki/Dander \"Dander\"), reducing allergic responses.[7]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Finnegan_the_Goldendoodle_having_fun_in_the_snow.jpg/220px-\nFinnegan_the_Goldendoodle_having_fun_in_the_snow.jpg)](/wiki/File:Finnegan_the_Goldendoodle_having_fun_in_the_snow.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Finnegan_the_Goldendoodle_having_fun_in_the_snow.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1 Year-old Goldendoodle with medium length hair\n\n### Coat[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Goldendoodle&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Coat\")]\n\nThere are three main coat types. There is the straight coat, which is flat and\nresembles more of a golden retriever coat. The wavy coat type is a mixture of\na poodle's curls, and a golden retriever's straighter coat. The last coat type\nis curly, which tends to look more like the poodle coat. A goldendoodle's size\nis generally somewhere between that of its poodle parent and golden retriever\nparent. The ranges of size include standard, medium, and miniature (if the\npoodle parent was miniature). Upon reaching adulthood, a standard goldendoodle\nwill often weigh 60 to 100 pounds. A medium goldendoodle will weigh between 30\nand 45 pounds and a miniature goldendoodle will weigh approximately 15 to 30\npounds. The standard in height at the shoulder for a male goldendoodle is\nabout 24-26 inches. For females, it is 22-23 inches. Often, taller\ngoldendoodles inherit more from the golden retriever and will weigh\nsubstantially more. It is very common for the goldendoodle to inherit the\n\"golden retriever bump\" on top of his/her head.[3][8] Common coat colors\ninclude white, cream, apricot, gold, red, and sometimes gray and black (also\ncalled phantom). Goldendoodles may also be black or a light sandy brown.[9]\nThey are classified into types according to the breed of its parents. An F1\ngoldendoodle is the offspring of a poodle mated with a golden retriever. An\nF1B goldendoodle is the offspring of a poodle with an F1 goldendoodle.[10] An\nF2 goldendoodle is the offspring of an F1 and another F1 goldendoodle, and an\nF2B goldendoodle is the offspring of an F1 and an F1B goldendoodles.\n\n## Breed status[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Goldendoodle&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Breed status\")]\n\nSee also: [Selective breeding](/wiki/Selective_breeding \"Selective breeding\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/3100489919_06e44ec1da_Goldendoodles.jpg/220px-3100489919_06e44ec1da_Goldendoodles.jpg)](/wiki/File:3100489919_06e44ec1da_Goldendoodles.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:3100489919_06e44ec1da_Goldendoodles.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGolden retriever and her litter of goldendoodle puppies, after having mated\nwith a poodle.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Twelve-\nweek_old_goldendoodle_pup.JPG/220px-Twelve-\nweek_old_goldendoodle_pup.JPG)](/wiki/File:Twelve-\nweek_old_goldendoodle_pup.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Twelve-week_old_goldendoodle_pup.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nTwelve-week-old Goldendoodle puppy\n\nSome breeders prefer to restrict breeding to the first generation (F1) and\nfirst generation cross-back (F1B).[7] This is done in an attempt to maximize\ngenetic diversity and avoid the inherited health problems that have plagued\nmany dog breeds.[10]\n\nEstablished breed associations such as the [AKC](/wiki/American_Kennel_Club\n\"American Kennel Club\"), the [UKC](/wiki/United_Kennel_Club \"United Kennel\nClub\"), and the [CKC](/wiki/Canadian_Kennel_Club \"Canadian Kennel Club\"), do\nnot recognize this hybrid, nor any other designer cross, as a breed. However,\nsome major kennel clubs do accept registration of crossbreed and mixed-breed\ndogs for performance events such as agility and obedience such as the\nContinental Kennel Club. The Continental Kennel Club will accept and grant a\npedigree on a goldendoodle as long as the parents have registration.\n\n## Health[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Goldendoodle&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Health\")]\n\nWith knowledgeable breeding, the goldendoodle tends to be a rather healthy\ndog, but Poodles and Golden Retrievers are both susceptible to [hip\ndysplasia](/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_\\(canine\\) \"Hip dysplasia \\(canine\\)\").\nTherefore, an [OFA](/wiki/Orthopedic_Foundation_for_Animals \"Orthopedic\nFoundation for Animals\") or [PennHIP](/wiki/PennHIP \"PennHIP\") exam is highly\nrecommended to check for this problem before dogs are bred.\n\nBoth breeds can also suffer from a number of inheritable eye disorders, so it\nis important that annual CERF (Canine Eye Registration Foundation) exams are\nperformed before breeding.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The goldendoodle inherits the ears of Golden\nRetrievers; because their ears hang and do not allow water to drain, they are\nprone to ear infections and yeast infections in the ears from swimming. [Von\nWillebrands disease](/wiki/Von_Willebrands_disease \"Von Willebrands disease\")\n(vWD), a bleeding disorder, can also be found in the Poodle and should be\nscreened through DNA tests before breeding.\n\n## Usage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Goldendoodle&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Usage\")]\n\nSince 2005, Goldendoodles have been used as pets, agility dogs, [guide\ndogs](/wiki/Guide_dog \"Guide dog\"), [therapy dogs](/wiki/Therapy_dog \"Therapy\ndog\"), diabetic dogs, [search dogs and rescue\ndogs](/wiki/Search_and_rescue_dog \"Search and rescue dog\"), as they have\ninherited the poodle's intelligence and the golden retriever's ease of\ntraining.[11] Goldendoodles have also become increasingly used as domestic\npets due to their affection towards families, as well as their friendliness\nand patience with children and strangers.[12]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Goldendoodle&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[Goldendoodle](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Goldendoodle \"commons:Special:Search/Goldendoodle\")**_.  \n---|---  \n  \n### Citations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Goldendoodle&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Citations\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Vonnegut 2012, p. 151\n  2. **Jump up ^** Wheeler 2008, p. 11\n  3. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ [\"FAQ: Goldendoodles\"](http://www.goldendoodles.com/faqs/goldendoodle_faq.htm).
