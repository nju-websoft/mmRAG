He is a lawyer\nand was once known as \"the deadliest shot in Maycomb County\". Although he was\na good shot, he does not like to mention the fact as he does not like the\nthought of having an advantage over people. He appears to support racial\nequality and was appointed to represent Tom Robinson, a black man who has been\naccused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. The town disapproves of\nhim defending Tom especially when he makes clear his intent to defend Tom\nRobinson to the best of his abilities. He is portrayed by [Gregory\nPeck](/wiki/Gregory_Peck \"Gregory Peck\") in the film adaptation of _To Kill a\nMockingbird_.\n\n### \"Scout\"\nFinch[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: \"Scout\" Finch\")]\n\nJean Louise \"Scout\" Finch is the [narrator](/wiki/Narrator \"Narrator\") and _To\nKill a Mockingbird_ is told by an adult Scout who often comments on how she\ncould not understand something at the time but now can appreciate it. Scout is\nconsidered bright for her age and loves to read. She gets in trouble with her\nteacher Miss Caroline because Miss Caroline expects Scout to learn reading and\nwriting her way. She is a [tomboy](/wiki/Tomboy \"Tomboy\") and spends the most\nof her time with her brother Jem and best friend Dill. She matures from age 6\nto age 9 as the novel progresses but remains naive and idealistic, despite an\nincreased understanding of human nature and racism in her town. At the\nbeginning of the book, Scout is confused by some of the words and names she\nhears people directing towards her father, such as \"nigger-lover\". Being only\nsix, Scout does not know how to handle such situations so she tries to resolve\nher problems by fighting, or by talking to Atticus about what she has heard.\nBy the end of the book, Scout realizes that racism does exist and comes to\nterms with its presence in her town. Scout also learns how to deal with\nothers, including the Finch family housekeeper, Calpurnia, and her aunt,\nAlexandra. Scout is the only one of the novel's primary three children (Dill,\nJem, and herself) to see and speak to Boo Radley during the course of the\nnovel and realize that he is harmless, despite her initial fear of him. She\nalso stops a mob that is trying to lynch Tom Robinson by talking to the mob\nleader, Mr. Cunningham, about inviting his son, Walter, over for dinner. Mr.\nCunningham then tells the other mob members to get back in their cars and\nleave them alone. The members listen, and Scout unintentionally saves Tom\nRobinson's life. She is portrayed by [Mary Badham](/wiki/Mary_Badham \"Mary\nBadham\") in the film adaption of _To Kill a Mockingbird_.\n\n_Notable quote: \"Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One\ndoes not love breathing.\"_ [2]\n\n### \"Jem\"\nFinch[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: \"Jem\" Finch\")]\n\nJeremy Atticus \"Jem\" Finch is Atticus' son and Scout's older brother by four\nyears. Jem matures greatly throughout the course of the novel, much more\naffected by events than Scout seems to be. Being four years Scout's senior,\nJem is seen to have a greater understanding of - and therefore greater\ndifficulty in navigating - the obstacles thrown their way. Jem is seen\nexplaining many things to Scout throughout the novel. Bob Ewell breaks Jem's\narm, subsequently resulting in it being shorter than it had been, in an\nattempt to protect his sister. He is portrayed by [Phillip\nAlford](/wiki/Phillip_Alford \"Phillip Alford\") in the film adaptation of _To\nKill a Mockingbird_.\n\n### Dill\nHarris[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Dill Harris\")]\n\nCharles Baker \"Dill\" Harris is a short, smart boy who visits Maycomb every\nsummer from [Meridian](/wiki/Meridian,_Mississippi \"Meridian, Mississippi\"),\n[Mississippi](/wiki/Mississippi \"Mississippi\"), and stays with his Aunt Rachel\n(Aunt Stephanie in the film). Dill is the best friend of both Jem and Scout,\nand his goal throughout the novel is to get Boo Radley to come out of his\nhouse. The children concoct many plans to lure Boo Radley out of his house for\na few summers until Atticus tells them to stop. In chapter 5 of the novel,\nDill promises to marry Scout and they become \"engaged\". One night Dill runs\naway from his home in Meridian, arriving in Maycomb County where he hides\nunder Scout's bed. When she finds Dill, he tells both Scout and Atticus that\nhe was chained to a wall in his father's basement; later, he confesses he\nactually ran away because he felt he was being replaced by his stepfather.\nBefore Dill returned to Meridian after the summer, he went swimming with Jem\nat the Barker's Eddy creek. Scout, unfortunately, was unable to participate,\nbecause both boys were doing it naked.\n\nUnlike Scout and Jem, Dill lacks the security of family support. He is\nunwanted and unloved by his mother and stepfather: \"They do get on a lot\nbetter without me, I cannot help them any.\" As Francis (a cousin of Jem and\nScout) says, \"He hasn't got a home, he just gets passed around from relative\nto relative.\" Dill maintains he has no father; he doesn't know where his\nfather might live, or if he will ever come back. He is played by [John\nMegna](/wiki/John_Megna \"John Megna\") in the film adaption of _To Kill a\nMockingbird_.\n\nThis character is believed to be based on author [Truman\nCapote](/wiki/Truman_Capote \"Truman Capote\"), a childhood friend of Harper\nLee.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n###\nCalpurnia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Calpurnia\")]\n\nCalpurnia, nicknamed Cal, is the Finch family's African-American housekeeper,\nwhom the children love and Atticus deeply respects (he remarks in her defense\nthat she \"never indulged [the children] like most colored nurses\"). She is\nhighly regarded by Atticus. She is an important figure in Scout's life,\nproviding discipline, instruction, and love. She also fills the maternal role\nfor the children after their mother's death. Calpurnia is a mother herself and\nraised her son, Zeebo, to adulthood. Calpurnia is one of the few black\ncharacters in the novel who is able to read and write, and it is she who\ntaught Scout to write. She learned how to read from Miss Maudie's aunt, Miss\nBuford, who taught her how to read out of _[Blackstone's\n_Commentaries_](/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England \"Commentaries on the\nLaws of England\")_ , a book given to her. [Aunt\nAlexandra](/wiki/Aunt_Alexandra \"Aunt Alexandra\") despised Calpurnia because\nAlexandra believed that Calpurnia was not a \"maternal figure\" for Jem and\nScout, especially for Scout.\n\nCalpurnia is a member of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in Maycomb.\nWhile Scout always hears her speak proper English, she is surprised to learn\nthat Calpurnia does not do so at church, especially with the uneducated\nmembers of the congregation.\n\nWhile everyone in the novel is filtered through Scout’s perception, Calpurnia\nin particular appears for a long time more as Scout’s idea of her than as a\nreal person. At the beginning of the novel, Scout appears to think of\nCalpurnia as the wicked stepmother to Scout’s own Cinderella. However, towards\nthe end of the book, Scout views Calpurnia as someone she can look up to, and\nrealizes Calpurnia has only protected her over the years. She is played by\n[Estelle Evans](/wiki/Estelle_Evans \"Estelle Evans\") in the film.\n\n### [Arthur] Boo\nRadley[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: \\[Arthur\\] Boo Radley\")]\n\nArthur \"Boo\" Radley is a [recluse](/wiki/Recluse \"Recluse\") in _To Kill a\nMockingbird_ who slowly reveals himself to Jem and Scout.\n\nMaycomb children believe he is a horrible person, due to the rumors spread\nabout him and a trial he underwent as a teenager. It is implied during the\nstory that Boo is a very lonely man who attempts to reach out to Jem and Scout\nfor love and friendship, such as leaving them small gifts and figures in a\ntree knothole. Scout finally meets him at the very end of the book, when he\nsaves the children's lives from Bob Ewell. Scout describes him as being sickly\nwhite, with a thin mouth, thin and feathery hair, and grey eyes, almost as if\nhe were blind. During the same night, when Boo whispers to Scout to walk him\nback to the Radley house, Scout takes a moment to picture what it would be\nlike to be Boo Radley. While standing on his porch, she realizes his \"exile\"\ninside his house is really not that lonely.\n\nBoo Radley's heroics in protecting the children from Bob Ewell are covered up\nby Atticus, Sheriff Tate, and Scout. This can be read as a wise refusal of\nfame. As Tate notes, if word got out that Boo killed Ewell, Boo would be\ninundated with gifts and visits, calamitous for him due to his reclusive\npersonality. The precocious Scout recognizes the danger: renown would \"kill\nthe mockingbird\". Boo Radley is a ghost who haunts the book yet manifests\nhimself at just the right moments in just the right way. He is, arguably, the\nmost potent character in the whole book and as such, inspires the other key\ncharacters to save him when he needs saving.\n\nAfter the Tom Robinson trial, Jem and Scout have a different understanding of\nBoo Radley. “Scout, I think I'm beginning to understand something. I think I'm\nbeginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this\ntime… it's because he wants to stay inside.\" (23.117) Having seen a sample of\nthe horrible things their fellow townspeople can do, choosing to stay out of\nthe mess of humanity doesn’t seem like such a strange choice.[3]\n\nWhen Boo finally does come out, he has a good reason: Bob Ewell is trying to\nmurder the Finch children. No one sees what happens in the scuffle, but at the\nend of it, Ewell is dead and Boo carries an unconscious Jem to the Finch\nhouse. Finally faced with Boo, Scout doesn’t recognize him at first, but\nsuddenly realizes who he is. Boo Radley is played by [Robert\nDuvall](/wiki/Robert_Duvall \"Robert Duvall\") in the film.\n\n### Judge John\nTaylor[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Judge John Taylor\")]\n\nJudge John Taylor is a white-haired old man with a reputation for running his\ncourt in an informal fashion and an enjoyment of singing and dipping tobacco.\nHe is unimportant to the children until he presides over the Tom Robinson\ntrial, in which he shows great distaste for the Ewells and great respect for\nAtticus. Because of the judge's sympathies for Tom, Bob Ewell breaks into the\njudge's house while the judge's wife is at church. After the trial, Miss\nMaudie points out to the children that the judge had tried to help Tom by\nappointing Atticus to the case instead of Maxwell Green, the new, untried\nlawyer who usually received court-appointed cases. Judge Taylor knew that\nAtticus was the only man who would stand a chance at acquitting Tom, or at\nleast would be able to keep the jury thinking for more than a few minutes. By\ndoing this, Judge Taylor was not giving in or supporting racism. He is\nportrayed in the film by Paul Fix.\n\n### Miss Maudie\nAtkinson[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Miss Maudie Atkinson\")]\n\nMiss Maude \"Maudie\" Atkinson lives across the street from the Finch family.\nShe had known the Finches for many years, having been brought up on the Buford\nplace, which was near the Finches' ancestral home, Finch's Landing. She is\ndescribed as a woman of about 40 who enjoys baking and gardening; her cakes\nare especially held in high regard. However, she is frequently harassed by\ndevout [\"Foot-Washing Baptists\"](/wiki/Primitive_Baptists \"Primitive\nBaptists\"), who tell her that her enjoyment of gardening is a sin. Miss Maudie\nbefriends Scout and Jem and tells them stories about Atticus as a boy. Also,\nshe is one of the few adults that Jem and Scout hold in high regard and\nrespect. She does not act condescendingly towards them, even though they are\nyoung children. During the course of the novel, her house burns down; however,\nshe shows remarkable courage throughout this (even saying that she wanted to\nburn it down herself to make more room for her flowers). She is not\nprejudiced, though she talks caustically to Miss Stephanie Crawford, unlike\nmany of her Southern neighbors, and teaches Scout important lessons about\nracism and human nature. It is important to note that Miss Maudie fully\nexplains that \"it is a sin to kill a mockingbird\", whereas [Atticus\nFinch](/wiki/Atticus_Finch \"Atticus Finch\") initially brings up the subject\nbut doesn't go into depth. When Jem gets older, and doesn't want to be\nbothered by Scout, Miss Maudie keeps her from getting angry. Maudie is played\nby [Rosemary Murphy](/wiki/Rosemary_Murphy \"Rosemary Murphy\") in the film.\n\n### Bob\nEwell[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Bob Ewell\")]\n\nRobert E. Lee \"Bob\" Ewell is the main [antagonist](/wiki/Antagonist\n\"Antagonist\") of _To Kill a Mockingbird_. He has a daughter named Mayella and\na younger son named Burris, as well as six other unnamed children. He is an\nalcoholic, poaching game to feed his family because he spends whatever money\nthey legally gain via government \"relief checks\" on alcohol. It is implied,\nand evidence suggests, that he was the one who abused his daughter Mayella,\nnot Tom Robinson (the African American man accused of doing so). Although most\neverybody in town knows that the Ewells are a disgrace and not to be trusted,\nit is made clear that Tom Robinson was convicted because he is a Negro whose\naccuser is white. Upon hearing of Tom's death, Bob is absolutely gleeful,\ngloating about his success. After being humiliated at the trial, however, he\ngoes on a quest for revenge, becoming increasingly violent. He begins by\nspitting in Atticus' face, followed by a failed attempt to break into the home\nof Judge Taylor, then finally menacing Helen, the poor widow of Tom Robinson.\nEwell later attempts to murder Jem and Scout Finch with a knife to complete\nhis revenge. Fortunately, Boo Radley saves Jem and Scout and it is believed\nthat he kills Ewell with the knife. Heck Tate, the sheriff, puts in the\nofficial report that Bob Ewell fell on his own knife and died after lying\nunder a tree for 45 minutes. Ewell is played by [James\nAnderson](/wiki/James_Anderson_\\(American_actor\\) \"James Anderson \\(American\nactor\\)\") in the film.\n\n### Mayella\nEwell[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Mayella Ewell\")]\n\nMayella Violet Ewell, 19, is the oldest of the eight Ewell children. Before\nthe trial, Mayella is noted for growing red [geraniums](/wiki/Geraniums\n\"Geraniums\") outside her otherwise dirty home in order to bring some beauty\ninto her life. Due to her family's living situation, Mayella has no\nopportunity for human contact or love. She eventually gets so desperate that\nshe attempts to seduce a black man, Tom Robinson, by saving up nickels to send\nthe children that play nearby to go get ice cream so that Mayella can be alone\nwith Tom. Her father sees this through a window and in punishment he beats\nher. Ewell then finds the sheriff, Heck Tate, and tells him that his daughter\nhas been raped and beaten by Tom. At the trial, Atticus points out that only\nthe right side of Mayella's face is injured, suggesting a left-handed\nassailant; Tom's left arm is mangled and useless, but Bob Ewell is left-\nhanded. When Atticus asks her if she has any friends, she becomes confused\nbecause she does not know what a friend is. During her testimony she is\nconfused by Atticus' polite speech and thinks that his use of \"Miss Mayella\"\nis meant to mock her. She testifies against Tom Robinson. Mayella is played by\n[Collin Wilcox](/wiki/Collin_Wilcox_\\(actress\\) \"Collin Wilcox \\(actress\\)\")\nin the film.\n\n### Tom\nRobinson[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Tom Robinson\")]\n\nThomas \"Tom\" Robinson is an African-American who is put on trial for the rape\nof a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands\nup to a [lynch mob](/wiki/Lynching \"Lynching\") intent on exacting their own\njustice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and\nuseless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child.\nAtticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing\nout that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-\nhanded assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with\nhousehold chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life\n- a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled\ndefense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus\nplans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed\nwhile trying to escape the prison where he is being held. Tom Robinson is\nplayed by [Brock Peters](/wiki/Brock_Peters \"Brock Peters\").\n\n### Aunt\nAlexandra[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Aunt Alexandra\")]\n\nAlexandra Hancock (_née_ Finch) is Atticus' and Jack's sister, married to\nJames \"Uncle Jimmy\" Hancock. She has a son named Henry and a very\n[spoiled](/wiki/Spoiled \"Spoiled\") grandson named Francis. Around the middle\nof the book, Aunt Alexandra decides to leave her husband at Finch's Landing,\nthe Finch family homestead to come stay with the Finches. Aunt Alexandra\ndoesn't consider the [black](/wiki/African_American \"African American\")\nCalpurnia to be a very good motherly figure for Jem and Scout; she disapproves\nof Scout being a [tomboy](/wiki/Tomboy \"Tomboy\") and wants to make Scout into\na [southern belle](/wiki/Southern_belle \"Southern belle\") (encouraging her to\nact more 'lady like').[4] This is the cause of many conflicts between Scout\nand Alexandra throughout the course of the novel. However, as the trial\nprogresses, Scout comes to see how much her aunt cares for her father and what\na strong woman she is. This is especially evidenced by a tea party when Scout\nis horrified by the racism displayed, and her aunt and Miss Maudie help her\ndeal with her feelings. By the end of the book, it's clear that Alexandra\ncares very much for her niece and nephew, though she and Scout will probably\nnever really get along.\n\n## Minor\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Minor characters\")]\n\n### Jack\nFinch[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Jack Finch\")]\n\nJohn Hale \"Jack\" Finch is Atticus' and Alexandra's younger brother. (He is\nabout 40, which is 10 years younger than Atticus.) Jack smells like alcohol\nand something sweet, and is said that he and Alexandra have similar features.\nJack is a childless doctor who can always make Scout and Jem laugh, and they\nadore him. He and Miss Maudie are close to the same age; he frequently teases\nher with marriage proposals, which she always declines. Jack also has a pet\ncat named Rose Aylmer, who is mentioned during the Christmas visit.\n\n### Francis\nHancock[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Francis Hancock\")]\n\nFrancis Hancock is the spoiled grandson of Aunt Alexandra. (The son of her\nson, Henry Hancock.) Every Christmas, Henry and his wife drop Francis at\nFinch's Landing, which is the only time Scout and Jem see him. Francis lives\nin [Mobile, Alabama](/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama \"Mobile, Alabama\"), and is a bit of\na tattle-tale. He gets along well with Jem, but often spars with Scout. One\nChristmas, Francis calls Atticus a \"nigger-lover,\" as well as insisting that\nhe was ruining the family and the likes, which infuriates Scout and causes\nthem to get into a fight. Francis lies about his role in it, telling Uncle\nJack that Scout started it by calling him a \"whore lady\", and Jack therefore\npunishes Scout. However, she explains the full story and charitably persuades\nher uncle not to punish Francis about it, but to let Atticus think they had\nbeen fighting about something else (although Atticus later discovers the\ntruth).\n\n### Mrs. Henry Lafayette\nDubose[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose\")]\n\nMrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose is an elderly woman who lives near the Finches.\nShe is hated by the children, who run by her house to avoid her. Scout\ndescribes Mrs. Dubose as \"plain hell.\" A virulent [racist](/wiki/Racism\n\"Racism\"), she calls Atticus a \"nigger-lover\" to his children's faces, and Jem\nflies into a rage and ravages Mrs. Dubose's [camellia](/wiki/Camellia\n\"Camellia\") bushes. As a punishment, Jem is required to read to Mrs. Dubose\neach day for a month. As Jem reads, she experiences a fit of drooling and\ntwitching and does not seem to pay any attention to the words. When an alarm\nrings, Jem is allowed to leave for the day. She extends the punishment for one\nextra week and dies shortly after letting Jem go for the last time. Atticus\ninforms him that Mrs. Dubose was terminally ill and had become\n[addicted](/wiki/Substance_dependence \"Substance dependence\") to\n[morphine](/wiki/Morphine \"Morphine\"). By reading to her, Jem had distracted\nher so that she could break the addiction. In thanks, she leaves him a candy\nbox with a camellia flower in it; Jem burns the box in anger, but is later\nseen by Scout admiring the flower. Atticus tells Jem that Mrs. Dubose was the\nbravest person he ever knew, and she was trying to teach Jem the importance of\nbravery and true courage to endure anything when the situation is hopeless, as\nin her morphine addiction.\n\n### Mr. Heck\nTate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Mr. Heck Tate\")]\n\nMr. Heck Tate is a friend of Atticus and also the sheriff of Maycomb County.\nHe believes in protecting the innocent although he doesn't usually show it.\nWhen Tom has been locked in jail and a lynch mob turns up to kill him, the\nsheriff refuses to hand Tom over, instead dispersing the crowd. At the end of\nthe book, the two men argue over whether Jem or Boo Radley should be held\nresponsible for the death of Bob Ewell. Heck eventually persuades Atticus to\naccept the theory that Ewell accidentally fell on his own knife, thus saving\nthe harmless, reclusive Boo from the public exposure of a criminal trial.\n\n### Mr. Braxton\nUnderwood[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Mr. Braxton Underwood\")]\n\nMr. Braxton Bragg Underwood is a news reporter and a friend of Atticus. He\nowns and also publishes _The Maycomb Tribune_. Being a racist, he disagrees\nwith Atticus on principle. He also has a strong belief in justice, as\nexemplified when he defends Atticus from the Cunningham mob by having his\ndouble barrel shotgun loaded and ready to shoot them. He also demonstrates\nsome humanity when he publishes a scathing editorial comparing the killing of\nTom Robinson (a cripple) to \"the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters\nand children\".\n\n### Mr. Horace\nGilmer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Mr. Horace Gilmer\")]\n\nMr. Horace Gilmer is a lawyer from Abbottsville, and is the prosecuting\nattorney in the Tom Robinson case. Mr. Gilmer is between the ages of forty and\nsixty. Mr. Gilmer has a slight cast with one eye, which he uses to his\nadvantage in trial. Mr. Gilmer appeared to be racist in his harsh cross-\nexamination of Tom Robinson, but it is hinted at that he is in fact going easy\non Tom. He and Atticus are not rivals and talk to each other during recesses\nduring the case.\n\n### Dr. Scott\nReynolds[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Dr. Scott Reynolds\")]\n\nDr. Reynolds is the Maycomb doctor. He is well known to Scout and Jem. Scout\nsays that he \"had brought Jem and me into the world, had led us through every\nchildhood disease known to man including the time Jem fell out of the tree\nhouse, and he had never lost our friendship. Dr. Reynolds said that if we were\nboil-prone things would have been different _... \" (ch. 28)_.

In fact, he has children\nwith a black woman. Dolphus pretends he is an alcoholic so that the people of\nMaycomb will have an excuse for his behavior, but in fact he only drinks [Coca\nCola](/wiki/Coca-Cola \"Coca-Cola\") out of a paper bag to try to hide it. When\nDill and Scout discover that he is not a drunk, they are amazed. He shows\nScout how sometimes you can pretend to be someone you're not so people will be\nmore understanding of you.\n\n### Link\nDeas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Link Deas\")]\n\nLink Deas owns cotton fields and a store in Maycomb who employs Tom and later\nHelen because she does not get accepted by any other employers in the county\ndue to Tom Robinson's legal troubles. He announces to the court (in defense of\nTom) at one point in the trial that he hadn't “had a speck o' trouble outta\nhim” in the eight years Tom had been working for him, and gets sent out by\nJudge John Taylor for doing so. When Bob Ewell starts threatening Helen after\nthe trial, Mr. Deas fiercely defends her and threatens several times to have\nMr. Ewell arrested if he keeps bothering her. He is on Tom Robinson's side\nduring the trial and remains loyal to the family afterwards.\n\n### Miss Caroline\nFisher[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Miss Caroline Fisher\")]\n\nMiss Caroline Fisher is Scout's first grade teacher and is new to Maycomb,\nAlabama and its ways. She attempts to teach the first grade class using a new\nsystem which she learned from taking certain college courses (Jem mistakenly\nrefers to it as the \"[Dewey Decimal System](/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification\n\"Dewey Decimal Classification\")\", which is really how library books are\norganized.). She is upset by Scout's advanced reading capabilities and\nbelieves that Scout is receiving lessons from Atticus. She feels as though\nScout is trying to outsmart and mock her. In an effort to standardize the\nclass, she forbids Scout from reading with her father. Atticus asks Scout to\nstep into Miss Caroline's skin. However, he continues to allow Scout to read\nwith him at night so long as she continues to go to school. Miss Caroline has\ngood intentions but proves quite incompetent as a teacher. When Scout tells\nMiss Fisher that she shamed a student (Walter Cunningham, Jr.) by giving him\nlunch money, she raps Scout's palms with a ruler (a punishment unheard of in\nMaycomb). She is also very sensitive and gets emotionally hurt quite easily,\nas seen when she cries after Burris Ewell yells at her, \"Report and be damned\nto ye! Ain't no snot-nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do\nnothin'! You ain't makin' me go nowhere, missus. You just remember that, you\nain't makin' me go nowhere!\" After the Burris Ewell incident, Miss Caroline is\nseldom seen and soon forgotten.\n\n### Reverend\nSykes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Reverend Sykes\")]\n\nReverend Sykes is the reverend of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in\nMaycomb County. This is the church Tom Robinson attended. Reverend Sykes\nforces the congregation to donate 10 dollars for Tom Robinson's family since\nat the time, Tom's wife, Helen, was having trouble finding work. During the\ntrial, when the courtroom was too packed for the children to find seats,\nReverend Sykes lets the kids sit with him up in the colored balcony and even\nsaves their seats for them.\n\n### Miss Stephanie\nCrawford[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Miss Stephanie Crawford\")]\n\nStephanie Crawford is the neighborhood gossip who claimed that she saw Boo\nRadley from her bedroom standing outside of her cleaned window one night.\nCrawford is one of the first on the scene after a loud gunshot is heard behind\nthe Radley house. Because she is the neighborhood gossip, it is unwise to\nthink of anything that she says as true, because most of the time it is not\ntrue at all. She is a friend of Alexandra Hancock. She lets Miss Maudie live\nwith her when Miss Maudie's house burns down, supposedly in order to steal\nMiss Maudie's Lane cake recipe. She is thrilled to pass on gossip to the kids\nabout Boo Radley. She claimed to have witnessed Bob Ewell's threatening\nAtticus at the Post Office corner as she was returning from the local Jitney\nJungle grocery store.\n\nIn the film she takes the place of Rachel Haverford and is now Dill's aunt.\n\n### Miss Rachel\nHaverford[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Miss Rachel Haverford\")]\n\nMiss Rachel Haverford is Dill's aunt and the Finches' next door neighbor. She\ndrank neat whiskey heavily after seeing a rattlesnake coiled in her closet, on\nher washing, when she hung her negligee up. Even though she can be very hard\nto deal with, she truly does love her nephew. Her family name, in the legends\nof Maycomb County, is synonymous with jackass.\n\nIn the film, she is not a character and Miss Stephanie takes her place as\nDill's aunt.\n\n### Helen\nRobinson[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Helen Robinson\")]\n\nHelen Robinson is the wife of Tom Robinson. She is spoken about many times.\nShe has three children. Employed by Link Deas following the death of her\nhusband, she is repeatedly harassed by Bob Ewell when traveling to work. Upon\nlearning of this, Deas threatens Ewell, forcing him to stop. She is an example\nof how one person's actions can have an effect on a lot of people and she\nelucidates the hardships that surround the Tom Robinson case.\n\n### Nathan\nRadley[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Nathan Radley\")]\n\nNathan Radley is the brother of Arthur \"Boo\" Radley and another difficult\ncharacter to understand in _To Kill a Mockingbird_. When the children try to\ncatch a view of \"Boo\" late one night through a window, he shoots over their\nheads with a shotgun (albeit thinking he was aiming at a black person). Nathan\nalso cements up the knothole in which Arthur leaves little gifts for the\nchildren. On the other hand, he helps Miss Maudie by saving some of her\nbelongings when her house is on fire. He is more present than his brother, but\nequally mysterious.\n\n###\nJessie[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Jessie\")]\n\nJessie is Mrs. Dubose's black nurse.

When Jem is forced to stay reading to Mrs. Dubose, Jessie kindly leads\nJem and Scout to the door when Mrs. Dubose's alarm goes off. The rumors about\nMrs. Dubose concealing a gun about her person involves Jessie; the book says\n\"and even if Mrs. Dubose missed, her girl Jessie wouldn't\".\n\n### Burris\nEwell[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Burris Ewell\")]\n\nBurris Ewell is a son of Bob Ewell and a younger sibling of Mayella Ewell as\nwell as the first antagonist of the novel. Burris is described as being\nchiefly antagonistic of Little Chuck Little and his teacher Miss Caroline\nFisher. He comes to the first day of school, but departs just as everyone else\nin his family does. Burris is also poor. He has live lice in his hair. Burris\nalso scared his teacher Caroline Fisher. He behaves rudely when she tells him\nto go home, wash his hair, and come back clean the next day. He refuses, and a\nstudent explains to Miss Caroline that Ewell children don't attend school. All\nthey do is show up for the first day, get marked down on the register, and\nthen they miss the entire school year until the first day of the next year.\nHis famous quote was, \"Report and be damned to ye! Ain't no snot-nosed slut of\na schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do nothin'! You ain't makin' me go\nnowhere, missus. You just remember that, you ain't makin' me go nowhere!\" As\nof Scout's first year of school (the first grade), Burris has repeated the\nfirst grade three times.

She doesn't\nlike the idea of Calpurnia bringing Atticus Finch's children, Jem and Scout,\nwith her to church and tells her so but is overruled by the other congregants.\nAccording to James Zeebo, Calpurnia's son, Lula's said to be, \"a troublemaker\nfrom way back, with fancy ideas and haughty ways.\" She's threatened with being\n\"churched\" (subjected to church discipline) by Reverend Sykes.\n\n### Mrs. Grace\nMerriweather[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Mrs. Grace Merriweather\")]\n\nMrs. Grace Merriweather is the producer of the play in which Scout plays as a\nham. She tells Everett that \"the ladies of the South Maycomb Alabama Methodist\nEpiscopal Church are behind him one hundred percent.\" She is mostly known for\nher devotion to the church and is widely held as the most devout lady in\nMaycomb; however, like many of her peers, she is very hypocritical and loves\nto gossip with all the other women.\n\n### Walter Cunningham,\nJr.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Walter Cunningham, Jr.\")]\n\nWalter Cunningham, Jr is a child who is almost as old as Jem but is in Scout's\nclass. He is too poor to even pay off a 25-cent debt because the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\") hit his poor family\nhard. Walter is not only too poor but also his family is too proud to take any\nmoney. He is invited over to the Finches' house once, after engaging in a\nfight with Scout, where he covers up all of his dinner with molasses, much to\nScout's vocal dismay. This teaches Scout a lesson in humility and compassion.\n\n### Walter Cunningham,\nSr.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Walter Cunningham, Sr.\")]\n\nWalter Cunningham, Sr. is Walter Cunningham Jr.'s father. He appears only\ntwice, once at the beginning of the story when he has to pay off the debt to\nAtticus (Walter Cunningham Sr. was his client) by giving him firewood,\nvegetables and other supplies. He also leads the mob that comes to lynch Tom\nRobinson the night before the trial. Only when Scout talks to him about his\nson and how much he owes to Atticus does he reconsider and call off the mob.\nScout innocently shames him because Scout reminds him of all the things that\nAtticus has done for him and for Maycomb County. After the verdict is given in\nthe trial, Atticus tells Jem that one of the Cunninghams had changed his\nthoughts about Tom and pleaded that Tom was not guilty to the jury.\n\n### Little Chuck\nLittle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=36\n\"Edit section: Little Chuck Little\")]\n\nLittle Chuck Little is a student in Scout's first grade class who has the\nmindset of an adult. His real name is Charles. He is depicted as chiefly\nantagonistic of Burris Ewell. He is presented in the novel when Miss Caroline\nis frightened by Burris' lice. He warned Miss Caroline that if Burris wasn't\nreleased from class, he might try something that would put their classmates at\nrisk. When Burris starts advancing on Little Chuck after his warning/veiled\ninsult, Little Chuck's hand moved to his pocket (implying that he was going to\npull out a knife) while saying, \"Watch your step, Burris. I'd soon's kill you\nas look at you. Now go home.\" Scared by Little Chuck's bravery and his implied\nknife, Burris retreats. From this we see, through the narrative view of Scout,\nhis gentlemanly attitude and how it calms Miss Caroline down. Little Chuck may\nbe even more intelligent than originally meets the eye, as he easily could\nhave been bluffing about the aforementioned implied knife to scare Burris into\nretreating.\n\n### Mr. Dick\nAvery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=37\n\"Edit section: Mr. Dick Avery\")]\n\nMr. Dick Avery is an overweight neighbor who tells Jem and Scout that dramatic\nchanges in the weather are caused by disobedient and misbehaving children.\nAfter it snows, they build a snowman that resembles him. Mr. Avery can also be\nseen in the story pushing a mattress out of a window when Miss Maudie's house\ncatches fire.

For instance, Jem claims that one night he urinated\nfrom his front porch in an impressive arc.\n\n### Miss\nGates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=38\n\"Edit section: Miss Gates\")]\n\nMiss Gates is a third grade teacher at Scout's school who insists that America\nisn't prejudiced like [Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler \"Adolf Hitler\")'s\n[Germany](/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi Germany\"). Despite this, Scout has heard\nher say that the blacks need to be taught a lesson after Tom's trial.\n\n### Eula\nMay[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=39\n\"Edit section: Eula May\")]\n\nEula May is Maycomb's most prominent telephone operator.

He and Scout then pair up at the\ncarnival. At the Halloween pageant afterwards, Cecil was a cow. He hints that\nblack people are not as good as white people while talking about Hitler during\ncurrent events. He also tends to take jokes too far. However importantly he\nshows how prejudice is passed on from parent to child.\n\n### Tim\nJohnson[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=41\n\"Edit section: Tim Johnson\")]\n\nTim Johnson is a dog belonging to Harry Johnson (a character in the book who\nis mentioned once but is never seen).

X is his name, and not his initial. He was asked\nrepeated times what his name was until he signed it. X was the name he had\nbeen given when he was born because his parents marked his birth certificate\nwith an X instead of a name.\n\n### The Barber Sisters (Miss \"Tutti\" and Miss\n\"Frutti\")[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&action=edit&section=45\n\"Edit section: The Barber Sisters \\(Miss \"Tutti\" and Miss \"Frutti\"\\)\")]\n\nThe Barber Sisters (Miss Sarah, nicknamed \"Tutti\" and Miss Frances, nicknamed\n\"Frutti\") are maiden sisters who live in the only house in Maycomb with a\ncellar.
