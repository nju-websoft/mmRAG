Between 2010 and\n2012, demand was thought to have doubled, leading to some butlers fetching\nsalaries as high as £150,000.[111]\n\nIn 2014, China's first school for butlers opened to meet a demand again\nattributed to the influence of _Downton Abbey_.[112]\n\nSome of the fashion items worn by characters on the show have seen a strong\nrevival of interest in the UK and elsewhere during the show's run, including\n[starched collars](/wiki/Starched_collar \"Starched collar\"), [midi\nskirts](/wiki/Broomstick_skirt \"Broomstick skirt\"), beaded\n[gowns](/wiki/Ball_gown \"Ball gown\"), and [hunting plaids](/wiki/Tartan\n\"Tartan\").[113]\n\nThe [Equality (Titles) Bill](/wiki/Equality_\\(Titles\\)_Bill \"Equality\n\\(Titles\\) Bill\") was an unsuccessful piece of legislation introduced in the\n[UK Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Parliament of the\nUnited Kingdom\") in 2013 that would have allowed equal succession of female\nheirs to [hereditary titles and peerages](/wiki/British_nobility \"British\nnobility\"). It was nicknamed the \"_Downton Abbey_ law\" because it addressed\nthe same issue that affects Lady Mary Crawley, who cannot inherit the estate\nbecause it must pass to a male heir.\n\nThe decor used on _Downton Abbey_ inspired [US Representative Aaron\nSchock](/wiki/Aaron_Schock \"Aaron Schock\") to redecorate his congressional\noffices in a more luxurious style.[114][115][116] He repaid the $40,000 cost\nof redecoration following scrutiny of his expenses and questions about his use\nof public money for personal benefit,[117] and subsequently resigned in March\n2015.[118]\n\n## Other media[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Downton_Abbey&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Other media\")]\n\n_The World of Downton Abbey_ , a book featuring a behind-the-scenes look at\n_Downton Abbey_ and the era in which it is set, was released on 15 September\n2011. It was written by [Jessica Fellowes](/wiki/Jessica_Fellowes \"Jessica\nFellowes\") (the niece of [Julian Fellowes](/wiki/Julian_Fellowes \"Julian\nFellowes\")) and was published by [HarperCollins](/wiki/HarperCollins\n\"HarperCollins\").[110][119]\n\nA second book also written by Jessica Fellowes and published by HarperCollins,\n_The Chronicles of Downton Abbey_ , was released on 13 September 2012. It is a\nguide to the show's characters through the early part of the third\nseries.[120]\n\nIn September 2012, _The Daily Telegraph_ reported Julian Fellowes as saying\nthat he was working on a spin-off prequel of _Downton Abbey_ that revolves\naround Lord Grantham and Cora's romance and eventual marriage as the earl and\ncountess of Downton Abbey. Initially planned as a book, it was then picked up\nby ITV.[121]\n\nDue to the show's popularity, there have been a number of references and\nspoofs on it, such as _[Family Guy](/wiki/Family_Guy \"Family Guy\")_ episode\n[Chap Stewie](/wiki/Chap_Stewie \"Chap Stewie\"), which has Stewie Griffin\nreborn in a household similar to Downton Abbey, and _[How I Met Your\nMother](/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother \"How I Met Your Mother\")_ episode [The\nFortress](/wiki/The_Fortress_\\(How_I_Met_Your_Mother\\) \"The Fortress \\(How I\nMet Your Mother\\)\"), where the gang watch a television show called 'Woodworthy\nManor', which is remarkably similar to Downton Abbey. In the episode the\ncharacter, Lily, celebrates by viewing an episode of 'Woodworthy Manor'.[122]\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that a spin-off prequel television series was in\nplanning. In April 2015, _[The Hollywood\nReporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_ reported\nthat Fellowes was planning to be at work on a new period drama series for [NBC\ntelevision](/wiki/NBC_television \"NBC television\"), to be set in late 19th-\ncentury [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), titled _The\nGilded Age_.[123]\n\nIn a 2015 interview with _[The Mail on Sunday](/wiki/The_Mail_on_Sunday \"The\nMail on Sunday\")_ , Fellowes suggested that a younger version of [Maggie\nSmith](/wiki/Maggie_Smith \"Maggie Smith\")'s Dowager Countess character from\nhis _Downton Abbey_ drama might appear in the new series, saying: \"Robert\nCrawley would be in his early teens, Cora would be a child. A young Violet\n[the Dowager Countess] could make an appearance.\"[123] As the title suggests,\nthe series is to be set during the time of America's so-called [Gilded\nAge](/wiki/Gilded_Age \"Gilded Age\") – the industrial boom era in the United\nStates in the late 19th and early 20th centuries – and portray the upper\nechelons of New York's [high society](/wiki/High_society_\\(group\\) \"High\nsociety \\(group\\)\") during that period.[123]\n\nProduction and writing for _The Gilded Age_ was updated in January 2016\nindicating that filming would start at the end of 2016. As reported in\nRadioTimes: \"NBC's _The Gilded Age_ is set to start shooting later this year,\nFellowes tells RadioTimes.com. Asked whether he'd written the script yet,\nFellowes said, 'No I haven't, no. I'm doing that this year', before adding:\n'And then hopefully shooting at the end of the year.'\"[124]\n\nOn 4 June 2016, Fellowes was asked by _The Los Angeles Times_ , \"Where does\n_The Gilded Age_ stand?\" Fellowes replied, \"It stands really with me up to my\nneck in research, and I’m clearing the decks, so that when I start _Gilded\nAge_ , I’m only doing _Gilded Age._ These people were extraordinary. You can\nsee why they frightened the old guard, because they saw no boundaries. They\nwanted to build a palace, they built a palace. They wanted to buy a yacht,\nthey bought a yacht. And the old guard in New York weren’t like that at all,\nand suddenly this whirlwind of couture descended on their heads. They\nredesigned being rich. They created a rich culture that we still have — people\nwho are rich are rich in a way that was established in America in the 1880s,\n’90s, 1900s. It was different from Europe. Something like Newport would never\nhave happened in any other country, where you have huge palaces, and then\nabout 20 yards away, another huge palace, and 20 yards beyond that another\nhuge palace. In England right up to the 1930s, when people made good money,\nthey would buy an estate of 5,000 acres and they’d have to look after Nanny.\nThe Americans of the 1880s and ’90s didn’t want too much of that.\"[125]\n\nFellowes and other co-workers on _Downton Abbey_ have indicated in April 2016\nan openness to consider possibilities for a feature film production of the\ntelevision series after the completion of its final season in 2015.[126]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Downton_Abbey&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of awards and nominations received by Downton Abbey](/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Downton_Abbey \"List of awards and nominations received by Downton Abbey\")\n  * _[Gosford Park](/wiki/Gosford_Park \"Gosford Park\")_\n  * _[The Cherry Orchard](/wiki/The_Cherry_Orchard \"The Cherry Orchard\")_\n  * _[The Duchess of Duke Street](/wiki/The_Duchess_of_Duke_Street \"The Duchess of Duke Street\")_\n  * _[The Shooting Party](/wiki/The_Shooting_Party \"The Shooting Party\")_\n  * _[The Remains of the Day](/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day_\\(film\\) \"The Remains of the Day \\(film\\)\")_\n  * _[Upstairs, Downstairs](/wiki/Upstairs,_Downstairs_\\(1971_TV_series\\) \"Upstairs, Downstairs \\(1971 TV series\\)\")_\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Downton_Abbey&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** For example, these structure changes resulted in the character of entail heir Matthew Crawley (played by Dan Stevens) coming into the storyline in the first episode in the United States broadcast, rather than in the second as he had in the UK broadcast.[45]\n  2. **Jump up ^** The series aired in the U.K. with commercial breaks, which required PBS, according to a spokeswoman, \"to plug those holes\".[46]\n  3. **Jump up ^** American heiresses who married into the British aristocracy during the [Gilded Age](/wiki/Gilded_Age \"Gilded Age\")—see: _[The Buccaneers](/wiki/The_Buccaneers \"The Buccaneers\")_ , a novel by Edith Wharton.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Downton_Abbey&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Downton Abbey (Masterpiece)\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20130413112333/http://www.emmys.com/shows/downton-abbey-masterpiece).
