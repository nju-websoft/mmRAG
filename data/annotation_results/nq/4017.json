Gran Colombia's monetary regulations retained\nthe old Spanish colonial system, with both milled and hammered coin\ncirculating. Gold and silver were minted at Popayán and Bogotá, copper at\nCaracas. On July 28, 1823, Bolívar authorized a mint at Quito, but almost a\ndecade would pass before one opened there. Cobs (macuquina) were ordered\nwithdrawn in 1826, but because of the lack of other coin, they continued to\ncirculate. All kinds of foreign coin circulated on the coast as a result of\nforeign trade, but in the interior provinces only old Spanish colonial coin\nand macuquina circulated, mostly Peruvian.\n\n## 1830–1850\nPeso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: 1830–1850 Peso\")]\n\nSee also: [Ecuadorian peso](/wiki/Ecuadorian_peso \"Ecuadorian peso\")\n\n### 1830–1836 State of\nEcuador[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1830–1836 State of Ecuador\")]\n\n#### Countermarked\ncoin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Countermarked coin\")]\n\nThe 1832 countermark was intended solely for coin minted at Bogotá\n(Cundinamarca) between 1815 and 1821.

A\n4-real coin was authorized October 8, 1841, with the same features as the\nother denominations, but with the added inscription \"MORAL INDUSTRIA\" around\nthe circumference, making the coin more difficult to counterfeit.\n\nPoor quality and counterfeit coin from Colombia and Bolivia entered\ncirculation in Ecuador, and the coins produced by the Quito mint had many\nflaws, so that currency standards were difficult to maintain. The use of\n[merchant tokens](/wiki/Token_coin \"Token coin\") became widespread. In an\nattempt to end the use of tokens, the government introduced a cuartillo (1/4\nreal) in 1842. The cuartillo was 333 fine and was called a _calé_ (the name\ngiven in Spain to the 4-maravedí coin and which in Ecuador came to be applied\nto any small coin of low value).\n\n#### Silver\ncoin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Silver coin\")]\n\nsilver 333 fine\n\n  * cuartillo, 16 mm (1842)\n\nsilver 666 fine\n\n  * 1/2 real, 17 mm (1838, 1840)\n  * real, 20 mm (1836–1841)\n  * 2 reales, 25 mm, 5.80–6.10 g (1836–1841)\n  * 4 reales, 31.5 mm (1841–1843)\n\n#### Gold\ncoin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Gold coin\")]\n\ngold 875 fine\n\n  * 1/2 onza (4 escudos), 28 mm, 13.500 (1836–1839, 1841)\n  * onza (8 escudos), 34 mm, 27.064 g (1838–1843)\n\n### 1843 monetary law and\ncoin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: 1843 monetary law and coin\")]\n\nCounterfeiting had reached alarming proportions during 1842. At this time,\nEcuador was on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nThe National Convention passed a new monetary law in June 1843, changing the\ncoin type (design) in an effort to distinguish good money from bad. It adopted\na new coat of arms for the obverse and placed a bust of Simón Bolívar on the\nreverse on both gold and silver. It authorized a gold onza (E.8), 1/2 onza\n(E.4), doblón (E.2), escudo, and 1/2 escudo (never minted). Silver coins were\nthe peso fuerte (R.8), medio peso (R.4), peseta (R.2), real, medio (R.1/2),\nand cuarto (R.1/4). But the absurdly low quantities of coin minted in\n1844–1845 resulted in an influx of worn coin and coin of inferior quality from\nneighboring countries.\n\n  * medio peso (R.4), 33 mm (1844, 1845)\n  * onza (E.8), 36 mm (1844, 1845)\n\n## 1846–1856 Peso\nfuerte[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: 1846–1856 Peso fuerte\")]\n\n###\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nOn December 29, 1845, President [Vicente Ramón\nRoca](/wiki/Vicente_Ram%C3%B3n_Roca \"Vicente Ramón Roca\") authorized a coin to\ncompete with the _fuertes_ (full-bodied coin) of other countries. This was the\npeso fuerte, 903 fine. The standard of 875 fine for gold was identical to that\nof Ecuador's neighbors and presented no problem. The standard of 903 fine for\nsilver, however, resulted in a heavy export of the coin. It disappeared as\nsoon as it entered circulation ([Gresham's law](/wiki/Gresham%27s_law\n\"Gresham's law\")), grabbed up by the merchants of [Guayaquil](/wiki/Guayaquil\n\"Guayaquil\"). On July 7, 1846, the value of the fuerte was raised from 8 to 9\nreales in a vain attempt to keep it in circulation.\n\nThe November 1846 monetary law adopted a new type with a bust of Bolívar for\ngold and a Liberty bust for silver. These appeared on coins dated 1847. The\nbulk of the circulating currency consisted of poor quality, worn coins. As\nsoon as the new silver coins appeared, they were clipped and perforated in\norder to reduce their value to that of the circulating currency, while gold\ncoins immediately disappeared abroad.\n\nBy the 1850s the Quito mint was not receiving enough precious metals to\njustify its operation. It had to coin a minimum of 6,000 pesos a year just to\nmeet overhead. The mint was shut down during 1853 while the government\nconsidered the options of keeping it open or shutting it down. The mint\nequipment was worn and could not produce coin in sufficient quantity to\ncompete with the foreign coin that entered Ecuador, especially through the\nport of Guayaquil.\n\nMany coins in circulation were pierced with a hole, and this was causing\nproblems in financial transactions. The governor of [Pichincha\nProvince](/wiki/Pichincha_Province \"Pichincha Province\") proclaimed that\nanyone piercing a coin minted after 1855 would be punished according to\nexisting penal regulations and that anyone receiving such a pierced coin had\nto make note of the person passing it.\n\n### Silver\ncoin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Silver coin\")]\n\nsilver 666 fine dated 1847–1852\n\n  * 1/4 real, 12 mm, 1849–1862\n  * 1/2 real, 17 mm, 1848–1849\n  * 2 reales, 27 mm, 1847–1852\n\nsilver 903 fine dated 1846\n\n  * peso fuerte, 38 mm, 27.000 g (1,386 pieces)\n\n### Gold\ncoin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Gold coin\")]\n\ngold, 875 fine dated 1847–1856\n\n  * onza, 37 mm, 27.064 g\n\n## 1856–1871\nFranco[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: 1856–1871 Franco\")]\n\nPeso = 5 Francos = 10 Reales\n\nSee also: [Ecuadorian peso](/wiki/Ecuadorian_peso \"Ecuadorian peso\")\n\n###\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nCongress passed a new monetary law on December 5, 1856, adopting the French\ndecimal system, a standard of 0.900 for silver, and the Ecuadorian Franco,\nequal to 4.500 g fine silver or 290.3225 mg fine gold. The peso remained a\nunit of account equal to 5 francos. This measure was intended to avoid the\nerror committed with the peso fuerte of 1846. Only decimal standard coins were\nto be accepted after October 15, 1866.\n\nThe Ecuadorian silver coinage had been debased ever since 1833. The government\nwanted to produce coins of high silver content to finance foreign exchange, so\nthe debased silver had to be withdrawn and replaced with 900 fine silver. This\nwas the reason for the 5-Franco coin, but its appearance in October 1858\ncaused some confusion. The decimal system was quite unfamiliar to the public\nand, despite the Franco's introduction, the custom of counting in pesos of 8\nreales or tostones of 4 reales continued.\n\nProduction of the 5 francos could not be sustained and it proved impossible to\nreplace all the poor coin (_moneda feble_ , i.e., coin 666 fine). The 1859\nearthquake closed the Quito mint until 1861.\n\nBanco Particular de Guayaquil obtained permission in June 1861 to have 200,000\npesos in coin 666 fine minted on the pre-1856 octal system (_Sistema\nOctavario_). Dies for the coins were engraved in Paris and arrived in Quito in\nOctober 1862. These were the last coins produced at the Quito mint. In\nFebruary 1863 the mint equipment gave out and the government did not attempt\nto replace it. Besides, Banco de Guayaquil had no wish to continue minting: in\nminting 35,580 pesos, it had suffered a loss of 6,776 pesos (19%). Thus, after\n1863, all Ecuadorian coin was minted abroad.\n\nTo keep coin in circulation, President [Gabriel García\nMoreno](/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_Moreno \"Gabriel García Moreno\") prohibited\nthe export of coin 666 fine. The circulation of various kinds of tokens became\ncommon. [Imbabura Province](/wiki/Imbabura_Province \"Imbabura Province\"), in\nthe north, was authorized to allow the free circulation of Colombian francos.\n\n### Paper[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Currency_of_Ecuador&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Paper\")]\n\n_Banco de Circulación y Descuento de Manuel Antonio de Luzarraga_ , Guayaquil,\nissued Ecuador's first banknotes in 1859 in denominations of 1, 4, 5, 10, and\n20 pesos.

The Sucre was named\nafter the Latin American revolutionary [Antonio José de\nSucre](/wiki/Antonio_Jos%C3%A9_de_Sucre \"Antonio José de Sucre\"). The 1884\nmonetary law permitted free circulation of gold coin of France, Italy,\nBelgium, Switzerland, Colombia, Peru, and the United States. As for silver,\nthe law permitted the import of 5-franc pieces of France, Italy, Belgium, and\nSwitzerland, of the pesos of Chile and Colombia, of the Peruvian sol, and of\nthe United States dollar and its fractions. Copper (_vellón_) was made legal\ntender to 5 décimos. Bank reserves were in silver coin and banknotes were\nconvertible solely into silver. Ecuador was on a _de facto_ [silver\nstandard](/wiki/Silver_standard \"Silver standard\") and did not coin any gold\nbetween 1884 and 1892. The government had silver coin minted abroad through\nthe offices of the private banks, usually taking 25% of the profit.\n\nThe Government signed a contract, October 6, 1887, with Banco del Ecuador to\nwithdraw Chilean coin and low-quality national coin and replace it with coin\nof standard fineness. A decree of April 12, 1889, made the Bolivian coin\ncirculating in the southern part of Ecuador equal to other coin, since its\nholders had been losing 20% on exchange. Banco Internacional was entrusted\nwith withdrawing the Bolivian coin, paying partly in good coin and partly in\nnotes. In 1890 Colombian coin 835 fine was exchanged at its face value.\n\nBetween 1887 and 1892 over 1.75 million sucres worth of substandard coin was\nwithdrawn, so that only high quality silver coin remained in circulation.\nPresident [Antonio Flores Jijón](/wiki/Antonio_Flores_Jij%C3%B3n \"Antonio\nFlores Jijón\") (son of Presidente Juan José Flores) announced that from August\n15, 1890, only national coin was allowed to circulate in Ecuador, and\nEcuador's monetary system was finally unified. But the total face value of\ncoin in circulation had been reduced. In order to alleviate the shortage of\nsmall change, the President authorized (June 14, 1890) the minting of 30,000\nsucres in copper coins of 1/2 and 1 centavo.\n\nThe fall in the price of silver had been gradual in 1884–1890, but became very\npronounced after 1893, and the government began looking at ways to adopt the\ngold standard.
