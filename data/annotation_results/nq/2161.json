The first Carmelites were Christian\n[hermits](/wiki/Hermits \"Hermits\") living on [Mount Carmel](/wiki/Mount_Carmel\n\"Mount Carmel\") in the [Holy Land](/wiki/Holy_Land \"Holy Land\") during the\nlate 12th and early to mid-13th century. They built in the midst of their\nhermitages a [chapel](/wiki/Stella_Maris_Monastery \"Stella Maris Monastery\")\nwhich they dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, whom they conceived of in\nchivalric terms as the \"Lady of the place.\" Our Lady of Mount Carmel was\nadopted in the 19th century as the patron saint of [Chile](/wiki/Chile\n\"Chile\"), in South America.\n\nSince the 15th century, popular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel has\ncentered on the [Scapular of Our Lady of Mount\nCarmel](/wiki/Scapular_of_Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel \"Scapular of Our Lady of\nMount Carmel\"), also known as the Brown Scapular, a\n[sacramental](/wiki/Sacramentals \"Sacramentals\") associated with promises of\nMary's special aid for the salvation of the devoted wearer. Traditionally,\nMary is said to have given the Scapular to an early Carmelite named Saint\n[Simon Stock](/wiki/Simon_Stock \"Simon Stock\"). The liturgical feast of Our\nLady of Mount Carmel is celebrated on 16 July.[1][2]\n\nThe solemn liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was probably first\ncelebrated in England in the later part of the 14th century. Its object was\nthanksgiving to Mary, the patroness of the Carmelite Order, for the benefits\nshe had accorded to it through its difficult early years. The institution of\nthe feast may have come in the wake of the vindication of their title\n\"Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary\" at Cambridge, England in 1374. The date\nchosen was 17 July; on the European mainland this date conflicted with the\nfeast of [St. Alexis](/wiki/Alexius_of_Rome \"Alexius of Rome\"), requiring a\nshift to 16 July, which remains the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel\nthroughout the [Catholic Church](/wiki/Catholic_Church \"Catholic Church\"). The\n[Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") poem _\"[Flos Carmeli](/wiki/Flos_Carmeli \"Flos\nCarmeli\")\"_ (meaning \"Flower of Carmel\") first appears as the\n[sequence](/wiki/Sequentia \"Sequentia\") for this [Mass](/wiki/Mass_\\(liturgy\\)\n\"Mass \\(liturgy\\)\").[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Carmelite devotion to Mary\n  * 3 Prayer to the Blessed Mother of Mount Carmel\n  * 4 Church teaching\n  * 5 Association with Purgatory\n  * 6 Apparitions\n  * 7 Miracles\n  * 8 Use in the peace movement\n  * 9 Gallery of statues\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe Carmelite Order was the only religious order to be started in the\n[Crusader States](/wiki/Crusader_States \"Crusader States\"). In the 13th\ncentury, some of its people migrated west to England, setting up a chapter and\nbeing documented there about 1241-1242. A tradition first attested to in the\nlate 14th century says that [Saint Simon Stock](/wiki/Saint_Simon_Stock \"Saint\nSimon Stock\"), believed to be an early English prior general of the Carmelite\nOrder soon after its migration to England,[3][4] had a vision of the Blessed\nVirgin Mary in which she gave him the Brown Scapular. This formed part of the\nCarmelite [habit](/wiki/Habit \"Habit\") after 1287.[5] In Stock's vision, Mary\npromised that those who died wearing the scapular would be saved.[3]\n\nThe Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is known to many Catholic faithful as\nthe \"scapular feast,\" associated with the Brown [Scapular](/wiki/Scapular\n\"Scapular\") of the Carmelite order. This is a devotional sacramental\nsignifying the wearer's consecration to Mary and affiliation with the\nCarmelite order.\n\nBased on available historical documentation, the liturgical feast of Our Lady\nof Mount Carmel did not originally have a specific association with the Brown\nScapular or the tradition of Stock's vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This\ntradition grew gradually, as did the liturgical cult of St. Simon. The latter\nhas been documented in Bordeaux, where Stock died, from the year 1435; in\nIreland and England, from 1458; and in the rest of the Order, from 1564.\nHistorians have long questioned whether Stock had the vision of Mary and the\nscapular.[1][6] Although Simon Stock was never officially canonized, his feast\nday was celebrated in the church.[7]\n\nIn 1642, a Carmelite named Fr. John Cheron published a document which he said\nwas a 13th-century letter written by Saint Simon Stock's secretary, Peter\nSwanington. Since the early 20th century, historians have concluded that this\nletter was forged, likely by Cheron himself.[6][7][8]\n\nBut Stock's vision was long embraced by many promoters of the scapular\ndevotion. The forged Swanington letter claimed that 16 July 1251 was the date\nof the vision (16 July being the date of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount\nCarmel), which led for centuries to a strong association between this feast\nday and the scapular devotion.\n\nAlso associated with Our Lady of Carmel was a papal bull saying that there was\na _[Sabbatine privilege](/wiki/Sabbatine_privilege \"Sabbatine privilege\")_\nassociated with devotion to the saint; that is, that Until the late 1970s, the\nCatholic liturgy for that day expressed the scapular devotion. [Vatican\nII](/wiki/Vatican_II \"Vatican II\") resulted in scrutiny of the Feast of Our\nLady of Mount Carmel, as well as that of Saint Simon Stock, because of the\nhistorical uncertainties about the origins. The liturgies were revised and, in\nthe 21st century, neither, even in the Carmelite proper, makes reference to\nthe scapular.[7] The Carmelite convent of [Aylesford](/wiki/Aylesford\n\"Aylesford\"), [England](/wiki/England \"England\"), was restored and a relic of\nSaint Simon Stock was placed there in 1951. The saint's feast is celebrated in\nthe places dedicated to him.[6]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Virgen_del_Carmen_-\n_Paucartambo_Peru.jpg/220px-Virgen_del_Carmen_-\n_Paucartambo_Peru.jpg)](/wiki/File:Virgen_del_Carmen_-_Paucartambo_Peru.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Virgen_del_Carmen_-_Paucartambo_Peru.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [saqra](/wiki/Saqra \"Saqra\") (animal figure) dancer watching the procession\nof _Mamacha Carmen_ from a balcony\n\nIn Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries, there has been particular\ndevotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, who has been adopted as a patron saint\nof several places, as she has been in other Catholic-majority countries. In\naddition, [Carmen](/wiki/Carmen \"Carmen\") and Mar√≠a del Carmen have been\npopular given names for girls in Spanish-speaking countries. For example, an\nannual festival, known as _Mamacha Carmen,_ is held in the highland\n[Paucartambo District](/wiki/Paucartambo_District,_Paucartambo \"Paucartambo\nDistrict, Paucartambo\"), [Peru](/wiki/Peru \"Peru\"), featuring a procession\nwith the Virgin and traditional dancers. Veneration of the Virgen del Carmen\n(often also associated with the Stella Maris) is particularly strong in\ncoastal towns of Spain.\n\n## Carmelite devotion to\nMary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Carmelite devotion to Mary\")]\n\nThe Carmelites consider the Blessed Virgin Mary to be a perfect model of the\ninterior life of [prayer](/wiki/Prayer \"Prayer\") and\n[contemplation](/wiki/Contemplation \"Contemplation\") to which Carmelites\naspire, as well as a model of virtue, in the person who was closest in life to\n[Jesus Christ](/wiki/Jesus_Christ \"Jesus Christ\"). She is seen as the one who\npoints Christians most surely to Christ. As she says to the servants at the\n[wedding at Cana](/wiki/Wedding_at_Cana \"Wedding at Cana\"), \"Do whatever he\n[Jesus] tells you.\" Carmelites look to the Virgin Mary as a Spiritual\nMother.[9] The [Stella Maris Monastery](/wiki/Stella_Maris_Monastery \"Stella\nMaris Monastery\") (Star of the Sea) on Mount Carmel, named after a traditional\ntitle of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is considered the spiritual headquarters of\nthe order.\n\nFr. Gabriel of St. Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi, OCD, a revered authority on\nCarmelite spirituality, wrote that devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel means:\n\n> a special call to the interior life, which is preeminently a Marian life.\n> Our Lady wants us to resemble her not only in our outward vesture but, far\n> more, in heart and spirit. If we gaze into Mary's soul, we shall see that\n> grace in her has flowered into a spiritual life of incalculable wealth: a\n> life of recollection, prayer, uninterrupted oblation to God, continual\n> contact, and intimate union with him. Mary's soul is a sanctuary reserved\n> for God alone, where no human creature has ever left its trace, where love\n> and zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of mankind reign supreme.\n> [...] Those who want to live their devotion to Our Lady of Mt. Carmel to the\n> full must follow Mary into the depths of her interior life. Carmel is the\n> symbol of the contemplative life, the life wholly dedicated to the quest for\n> God, wholly orientated towards intimacy with God; and the one who has best\n> realized this highest of ideals is Our Lady herself, 'Queen and Splendor of\n> Carmel'.\"[1]\n\n## Prayer to the Blessed Mother of Mount\nCarmel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Prayer to the Blessed Mother of Mount Carmel\")]\n\n> O most beautiful flower of Mt. Carmel, fruitful vine, splendor of Heaven,\n> Blessed Mother of the Son of God, Immaculate Virgin, assist me in my\n> necessity. O Star of the Sea, help me and show me you are my Mother. O Holy\n> Mary, Mother of God, Queen of Heaven and earth, I humbly beseech you from\n> the bottom of my heart to succor me in this necessity (make request). There\n> are none that can withstand your power. O Mary, conceived without sin, pray\n> for us who have recourse to thee. Sweet Mother I place this cause in your\n> hands. Amen.\n\n## Church\nteaching[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Church teaching\")]\n\nA 1996 doctrinal statement approved by the [Congregation for Divine Worship\nand the Discipline of the\nSacraments](/wiki/Congregation_for_Divine_Worship_and_the_Discipline_of_the_Sacraments\n\"Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments\") states\nthat\n\n> \"Devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel is bound to the history and spiritual\n> values of the Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount\n> Carmel and is expressed through the scapular. Thus, whoever receives the\n> scapular becomes a member of the order and pledges him/herself to live\n> according to its spirituality in accordance with the characteristics of\n> his/her state in life.\"[10]\n\nAccording to the Church on the Brown Scapular:\n\n> \"The scapular is a Marian habit or garment. It is both a sign and pledge. A\n> sign of belonging to Mary; a pledge of her motherly protection, not only in\n> this life but after death. As a sign, it is a conventional sign signifying\n> three elements strictly joined: first, belonging to a religious family\n> particularly devoted to Mary, especially dear to Mary, the Carmelite Order;\n> second, consecration to Mary, devotion to and trust in her Immaculate Heart;\n> third, an urge to become like Mary by imitating her virtues, above all her\n> humility, chastity, and spirit of prayer.\"[11]\n\n## Association with\nPurgatory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Association with Purgatory\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/V.Carmen_de_Beniajan-\ngeneral.jpg/220px-V.Carmen_de_Beniajan-\ngeneral.jpg)](/wiki/File:V.Carmen_de_Beniajan-general.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:V.Carmen_de_Beniajan-general.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel with angels and souls in [Purgatory](/wiki/Purgatory\n\"Purgatory\"). Baroque sculpture from [Beniaj√°n](/wiki/Beniaj%C3%A1n\n\"Beniaj√°n\") (Spain).\n\nSince the Middle Ages, Our Lady of Mount Carmel has been related to Purgatory,\nwhere souls are purged of sins in the fires. In some images, she is portrayed\nas accompanied with angels and souls wearing Brown Scapulars, who plead for\nher mediation. In 1613, the Church forbade images to be made of Our Lady of\nMt. Carmel descending into purgatory, due to errors being preached about\ncertain privileges associated with the Brown Scapular (known as \"the\n[Sabbatine Privilege](/wiki/Sabbatine_Privilege \"Sabbatine Privilege\")\").[12]\n\nThat privilege appears in the noted Decree of the Holy Office (1613). It was\ninserted in its entirety (except for the words forbidding the painting of the\npictures) into the list of the indulgences and privileges of the Confraternity\nof the Scapular of Mount Carmel.[13] In the 21st century, the Carmelites do\nnot promote the Sabbatine Privilege. They encourage a belief in Mary's general\naid and prayerful assistance for their souls beyond death, especially her aid\nto those who devoutly wear the Brown Scapular, and commend devotion to Mary\nespecially on Saturdays, which are dedicated to her.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Statua_Maria_del_Carmelo.jpg/200px-\nStatua_Maria_del_Carmelo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Statua_Maria_del_Carmelo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Statua_Maria_del_Carmelo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel, [Palmi](/wiki/Palmi \"Palmi\")\n\n##\nApparitions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Apparitions\")]\n\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel was seen in the apparitions of [Cova da\nIria](/wiki/Cova_da_Iria \"Cova da Iria\") in [F√°tima,\nPortugal](/wiki/F%C3%A1tima,_Portugal \"F√°tima, Portugal\"), by [L√∫cia\nSantos](/wiki/Sister_L%C3%BAcia \"Sister L√∫cia\") during the [Miracle of the\nSun](/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun \"Miracle of the Sun\").

An associated event has been\nclassified as the \"miracle of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\" For 17 days preceding\nthis earthquake, many of the faithful had reported strange eye movements and\nchanges in the coloring of the face in a statue of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\nThe local and national press reported these occurrences.\n\nIn the evening of 16 November, the faithful improvised a procession carrying\nthe statue of the Virgin of Carmel on their shoulders through the streets.\nWhen the procession reached the end of the city, a violent earthquake shook\nthe whole district of Palmi,[16] ruining most of the old houses along the way.\nBut, only nine people died out of a population of about 15,000 inhabitants, as\nalmost all of the population had been on the street to watch the procession\nand were not trapped inside the destroyed buildings. Therefore, the city\ncommemorates the 1894 procession each year, accompanied by firecrackers,\nlights, and festive stalls.\n\nThe Catholic Church has officially recognized the miracle.[17] On November 16,\n1896 the statue of the Virgin was crowned, based on the decree issued\nSeptember 22, 1895 by the [Vatican](/wiki/Holy_See \"Holy See\") Chapter.\n\n## Use in the peace\nmovement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Our_Lady_of_Mount_Carmel&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Use in the peace movement\")]\n\nThe first atomic bomb was exploded in the United States at the Trinity test\nsite on 16 July 1945, near [Alamogordo, New\nMexico](/wiki/Alamogordo,_New_Mexico \"Alamogordo, New Mexico\").

[Emmanuel Charles\nMcCarthy](/wiki/Emmanuel_Charles_McCarthy \"Emmanuel Charles McCarthy\"), a\npriest of the Eastern Rite (Byzantine-Melkite) of the Catholic Church,\ninitiated the \"16 July Twenty-Four Hours Day of Prayer,\" for Forgiveness and\nProtection with Our Lady of Mount Carmel, at Trinity Site in the New Mexico\ndesert.
