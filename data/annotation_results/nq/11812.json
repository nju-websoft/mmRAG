Hillary was immediately\nimpressed by Hunt's energy and determination.[22] Hillary had intended to\nclimb with Lowe, but Hunt named two teams for the assault: [Tom\nBourdillon](/wiki/Tom_Bourdillon \"Tom Bourdillon\") and [Charles\nEvans](/wiki/Charles_Evans_\\(mountaineer\\) \"Charles Evans \\(mountaineer\\)\");\nand Hillary and Tenzing.[23] Hillary, therefore, made a concerted effort to\nforge a working friendship with Tenzing.[22]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Tenzing_and_Hillary.jpg/220px-\nTenzing_and_Hillary.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tenzing_and_Hillary.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tenzing_and_Hillary.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTenzing and Hillary\n\nThe Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362\n[porters](/wiki/Porter_\\(carrier\\) \"Porter \\(carrier\\)\"), 20\n[Sherpa](/wiki/Sherpa_people \"Sherpa people\") guides, and 10,000 pounds (4,500\nkg) of baggage.[24][25] Lowe supervised the preparation of the [Lhotse\nFace](/wiki/Lhotse \"Lhotse\"), a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary\nforged a route through the treacherous [Khumbu Icefall](/wiki/Khumbu_Icefall\n\"Khumbu Icefall\").[26][27]\n\nThe expedition set up [base camp](/wiki/Base_camp \"Base camp\") in March 1953\nand, working slowly, set up its final camp at the [South Col](/wiki/South_Col\n\"South Col\") at 25,900 feet (7,890 m). On 26 May, Bourdillon and Evans\nattempted the climb but turned back when Evans' [oxygen\nsystem](/wiki/Oxygen_system \"Oxygen system\") failed. The pair had reached the\nSouth Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit.[25][28]\nHunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to attempt the summit.[28]\n\nSnow and wind delayed them at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28\nMay with the support of Lowe, [Alfred Gregory](/wiki/Alfred_Gregory \"Alfred\nGregory\"), and Ang Nyima.[29] The two pitched a tent at 27,900 feet (8,500 m)\non 28 May, while their support group returned down the mountain.[30] On the\nfollowing morning Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside\nthe tent. He spent two hours warming them over a stove before he and Tenzing,\nwearing 30-pound (14 kg) packs, attempted the final ascent.[31] The final\nobstacle was the 40-foot (12 m) rock face now called \"[Hillary\nStep](/wiki/Hillary_Step \"Hillary Step\")\"; Hillary later wrote:\n\n> I noticed a crack between the rock and the snow sticking to the East Face.

Hillary took a photo of Tenzing\nposing with his ice-axe, but there is no photo of Hillary.

A 2.3-metre (7.5 ft) bronze statue of Hillary\nwas erected outside [The Hermitage\nHotel](/wiki/The_Hermitage_Hotel,_Mount_Cook_Village \"The Hermitage Hotel,\nMount Cook Village\") at [Mount Cook Village](/wiki/Mount_Cook_Village \"Mount\nCook Village\"); it was unveiled by Hillary himself in 2003.[76] Various\nstreets, institutions and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are\nnamed after him – for example, the [Sir Edmund Hillary\nCollegiate](/wiki/Sir_Edmund_Hillary_Collegiate \"Sir Edmund Hillary\nCollegiate\") in [Otara](/wiki/Otara \"Otara\"), which was established by Hillary\nin 2001.[77]\n\nTwo Antarctic features are named after Hillary.

In each venue, school\nchildren and members of the public were invited to join together to climb a\nsignificant hill or site in their area to show their respect for Hillary. The\npublic were also invited to bring small rocks or pebbles that had special\nsignificance to them, that would be included in a memorial to Hillary at the\nbase of Mt Ruapehu, in the grounds of the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits\nCentre. Funds donated during the tour are used by the foundation to sponsor\nyoung New Zealanders on outdoor courses.

The track was opened on 11 January 2010, the second anniversary of\nHillary's death.[97][117] Rose Track, descending from Anawhata Road to Whites\nBeach, is named after the Rose family.[89][118]\n\nThe South Ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain, was\nrenamed Hillary Ridge on 18 August 2011. Hillary and three other climbers were\nthe first party to successfully climb the ridge in 1948.[119] In September\n2013 the Government of Nepal proposed naming a 7,681 metres (25,200 ft)\nmountain in Nepal [Hillary Peak](/wiki/Hillary_Peak \"Hillary Peak\") in his\nhonour.[120] After the _[New Horizons](/wiki/New_Horizons \"New Horizons\")_\nmission discovered a mountain range on [Pluto](/wiki/Pluto \"Pluto\") on 14 July\n2015, it was informally named [Hillary Montes](/wiki/Hillary_Montes \"Hillary\nMontes\") (Hillary Mountains) by [NASA](/wiki/NASA \"NASA\").[121]\n\nThe [Sir Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy\nMedal](/wiki/Sir_Edmund_Hillary_Mountain_Legacy_Medal \"Sir Edmund Hillary\nMountain Legacy Medal\"), awarded by the Nepalese NGO Mountain Legacy \"for\nremarkable service in the conservation of culture and nature in mountainous\nregions\" was inaugurated in 2003, with the approval of Sir Edmund Hillary.
