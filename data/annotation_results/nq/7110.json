The first European explorer\nknown to have sailed up the Saint Lawrence River itself was [Jacques\nCartier](/wiki/Jacques_Cartier \"Jacques Cartier\"). At that time, the land\nalong the river was inhabited by the [St. Lawrence\nIroquoians](/wiki/St._Lawrence_Iroquoians \"St. Lawrence Iroquoians\"); at the\ntime of Cartier's second voyage in 1535. Because Cartier arrived in the\nestuary on [Saint Lawrence](/wiki/Lawrence_of_Rome \"Lawrence of Rome\")'s feast\nday, he named it the _Gulf of Saint Lawrence_.[9] The Saint Lawrence River is\npartly within the U.S. and as such is that country's sixth oldest surviving\nEuropean place-name.[10]\n\nThe earliest regular Europeans in the area were the\n[Basques](/wiki/History_of_the_Basque_people#Modern_Period \"History of the\nBasque people\"), who came to the St Lawrence Gulf and River in pursuit of\nwhales from the early 16th century. The [Basque\nwhalers](/wiki/History_of_Basque_whaling \"History of Basque whaling\") and\nfishermen traded with indigenous Americans and set up settlements, leaving\nvestiges all over the coast of eastern Canada and deep into the Saint Lawrence\nRiver. Basque commercial and fishing activity reached its peak before the\n_[Armada Invencible](/wiki/Armada_Invencible \"Armada Invencible\")'_s disaster\n(1588), when the Spanish Basque whaling fleet was confiscated by King [Philip\nII of Spain](/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain \"Philip II of Spain\") and largely\ndestroyed. Initially, the whaling galleons from [Labourd](/wiki/Labourd\n\"Labourd\") were not affected by the Spanish defeat.\n\nUntil the early 17th century, the French used the name _Rivière du Canada_ to\ndesignate the Saint Lawrence upstream to Montreal and the Ottawa River after\nMontreal. The Saint Lawrence River served as the main route for European\nexploration of the North American interior, first pioneered by French explorer\n[Samuel de Champlain](/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain \"Samuel de Champlain\").\n\nControl of the river was crucial to [British strategy to capture New\nFrance](/wiki/Great_Britain_in_the_Seven_Years_War \"Great Britain in the Seven\nYears War\") in the [Seven Years' War](/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War \"Seven Years'\nWar\"). Having [captured Louisbourg](/wiki/Siege_of_Louisbourg_\\(1758\\) \"Siege\nof Louisbourg \\(1758\\)\") in 1758, the British sailed up to Quebec the\nfollowing year thanks to charts drawn up by [James Cook](/wiki/James_Cook\n\"James Cook\"). British troops were ferried via the Saint Lawrence to attack\nthe city from the west, which they successfully did at the [Battle of the\nPlains of Abraham](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Plains_of_Abraham \"Battle of the Plains\nof Abraham\"). The river was used again by the British [to\ndefeat](/wiki/Battle_of_Neuville \"Battle of Neuville\") the French siege of\nQuebec under the [Chevalier de Lévis](/wiki/Chevalier_de_L%C3%A9vis \"Chevalier\nde Lévis\") in 1760.\n\nBecause of the virtually impassable [Lachine Rapids](/wiki/Lachine_Rapids\n\"Lachine Rapids\"), the Saint Lawrence was once continuously navigable only as\nfar as Montreal. Opened in 1825, the [Lachine Canal](/wiki/Lachine_Canal\n\"Lachine Canal\") was the first to allow ships to pass the rapids. An extensive\nsystem of canals and locks, known as the [Saint Lawrence\nSeaway](/wiki/Saint_Lawrence_Seaway \"Saint Lawrence Seaway\"), was officially\nopened on 26 June 1959 by [Elizabeth II](/wiki/Elizabeth_II \"Elizabeth II\")\n(representing Canada) and President [Dwight D.\nEisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\") (representing\nthe United States). The Seaway now permits ocean-going vessels to pass all the\nway to [Lake Superior](/wiki/Lake_Superior \"Lake Superior\").\n\nDuring the [Second World War](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the [Battle\nof the St. Lawrence](/wiki/Battle_of_the_St._Lawrence \"Battle of the St.\nLawrence\") involved submarine and anti-submarine actions throughout the lower\nSaint Lawrence River and the entire [Gulf of Saint\nLawrence](/wiki/Gulf_of_Saint_Lawrence \"Gulf of Saint Lawrence\"), [Strait of\nBelle Isle](/wiki/Strait_of_Belle_Isle \"Strait of Belle Isle\") and [Cabot\nStrait](/wiki/Cabot_Strait \"Cabot Strait\") from May to October 1942, September\n1943, and again in October and November 1944. During this time, German\n[U-boats](/wiki/U-boat \"U-boat\") sank several merchant marine ships and three\nCanadian warships.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the river was the subject of a successful ecological\ncampaign (called \"Save the River\"), originally responding to planned\ndevelopment by the [United States Army Corps of\nEngineers](/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers \"United States Army\nCorps of Engineers\").
