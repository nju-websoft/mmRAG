However, after\n[Greg](/wiki/Greg_Heffley \"Greg Heffley\") rescues Manny, who got stuck inside\na tube in the play area, Greg ends up in a ball pit with a diaper stuck on his\nhand. He subsequently becomes infamous after the people around him record him\nand post the footage on the internet, leading Greg to be dubbed as 'Diaper\nHands.'\n\nLater, at the Heffley residence, Greg learns that Player Expo is taking place\nnot very far from Meemaw's house in [Indianapolis](/wiki/Indianapolis\n\"Indianapolis\"). Greg's gaming star, Mac Digby, will be attending, and Greg\nhopes to meet him and get in one of his videos so people will forget about his\nmeme-age as Diaper Hands. He acknowledges that he will have to somehow sneak\noff from the road trip and attend the Expo without his parents' knowledge,\nhowever. The Heffley family hits the road, where Greg, Rodrick, Frank, and\nManny's devices are immediately confiscated by Susan, who wants the road trip\nto be absolutely technology-free.\n\nAfter arriving at a motel, Rodrick accidentally locks a pizza, which is for\ndinner, inside a mini-safe, mistaking it for a\n[microwave](/wiki/Microwave_oven \"Microwave oven\"). Discouraged, Greg and\nRodrick are allowed to get in the hot tub, after another family (which Greg\nnicknames the Beardo family) have finished using it. But before that, Greg\ngets into the car and takes his phone out of the bag Susan had put it in and\nplans to use it discreetly. Later, when Greg and Rodrick are relaxing in the\nhot tub, Rodrick hears a notification from Greg's phone and discovers his\nplans to go to Player Expo. Greg discourages Rodrick from telling Susan,\nsaying that they had a rock band video game tournament there that Rodrick\ncould participate in. Liking the idea, Rodrick opts to go with Greg to the\nExpo.\n\nGoing to sleep, Greg is annoyed by a loud bang noise created by the Beardo\nsiblings, who playfully crash a trolley into a wall, and storms out of the\nroom. He confronts them but Brandi, the eldest sibling, crashes the trolley\ninto their car, leaving a huge scratch. Just as Mr. Beardo comes out of his\nmotel room, Brandi blames Greg responsible and Mr. Beardo goes after him but\nhe manages to outrun him. Greg returns to his room, but the next morning, he\nactually slept next to Mr. Beardo, who chases him again, but he manages to\nescape from the motel with his family.\n\nThe Heffleys attend a county fair where Manny wins a pig, but Mr. Beardo and\nhis family notices them and begins chasing after Greg but manages to outrun\nagain. Back at the road, the Heffleys, unable to take care of the pig, drop it\noff at the petting zoo, much to Manny's dismay, but not before Greg reroutes\nthe GPS to the Player Expo convention. Checking at the hotel room, Greg and\nRodrick sneak out to go to Player Expo using the excuse that they are going to\nget a present for Meemaw. However, after Frank and Susan sees their children\non live TV, they go to get the boys themselves.\n\nGreg finally sees Mac Digby participating in a video game competition.\nDesperate to be in one of his videos, Greg instructs Rodrick to record him\ngoing up on stage with Mac so his popularity will boost. But the attempt fails\nwhen Susan storms into the stage and inadvertently reveals that he is Diaper\nHands to the public, causing them to chant him. Susan opens up to Greg and\nsays that all she wanted was a nice road trip that would bring the family\ncloser together, and she accuses Greg of not caring. Greg snaps back at Susan,\nsaying that she doesn't care about what he wants, which is why he had to sneak\nout to the Expo in the first place. Hurt by her son's words, Susan hands her\nphone to Greg because she doesn't care anymore.\n\nOn the road again, the tarp on the boat that had been carrying the majority of\ntheir belongings, hitched to the car, flies off all across the road. The\nHeffleys recover their belongings when the Beardo van pulls up and begins\nstealing suitcases and clothes. They quickly pursue them into the motel room,\nwhere the Beardos occupied, and successfully retrieve their belongings.\n\nAfter encountering some trouble, the Heffleys celebrate happily at Meemaw's\nand get their car fixed, but the radiator breaks due to the AC not being\ncranked up all the way. A Spanish-speaking man who works for a towing company\npulls over to assist them, but none of the Heffleys can understand him, except\nManny, who speaks in fluent Spanish to the man and explains their current\nsituation. It's implied that he learned this skill from a CD Susan put in\nduring the road trip, which was a guide to learning Spanish.\n\nThe man, Mr. Luis, tows their car, but Manny gives him instructions to the\npetting zoo where his pig is, and the two reunite. At the end, Greg explains\nthat although the road trip wasn't perfect, he still wouldn't change a thing.\nHe says that Manny was allowed to keep his pig as a pet, Rodrick was able to\nget a new van, and Dad was able to explain having time off from work to bond\nwith family. Greg expresses excitement for where they'll be going next year,\nbut Susan steps in to say they will be flying.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, two girls take selfies with Greg, who they recognize\nas Diaper Hands.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * [Jason Drucker](/wiki/Jason_Drucker \"Jason Drucker\") as [Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley](/wiki/Greg_Heffley \"Greg Heffley\")\n  * [Alicia Silverstone](/wiki/Alicia_Silverstone \"Alicia Silverstone\") as Susan Heffley, Greg's mother\n  * [Tom Everett Scott](/wiki/Tom_Everett_Scott \"Tom Everett Scott\") as Frank Heffley, Greg's father\n  * [Charlie Wright](/wiki/Charlie_Wright_\\(actor\\) \"Charlie Wright \\(actor\\)\") as Rodrick Heffley, Greg's older brother\n  * Owen Asztalos as Rowley Jefferson, Greg's best friend\n  * Wyatt and Dylan Walters as Manny Heffley, Greg's little brother[5]\n  * Joshua Hoover as Mac Digby, a popular internet gamer who Greg idolizes\n  * [Chris Coppola](/wiki/Chris_Coppola \"Chris Coppola\") as Mr. Beardo, the main antagonist of the film\n  * Kimberli Lincoln as Mrs. Beardo, Mr. Beardo's wife\n  * Mira Silverman as Brandi Beardo, Mr. Beardo's rude and spoiled daughter who blames Greg for damaging their car\n  * Mimi Gould as Meemaw, Susan's grandmother and Greg's great-grandmother\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nIn 2012, the series' third entry, _[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog\nDays](/wiki/Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid:_Dog_Days_\\(film\\) \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog\nDays \\(film\\)\")_ was described as the last [live action film](/wiki/Live-\naction_film \"Live-action film\") in the franchise.[6][7] In August 2012, while\ndoing press for the film, author [Jeff Kinney](/wiki/Jeff_Kinney_\\(author\\)\n\"Jeff Kinney \\(author\\)\") and actors [Zachary Gordon](/wiki/Zachary_Gordon\n\"Zachary Gordon\") and [Robert Capron](/wiki/Robert_Capron \"Robert Capron\")\neach indicated that there were no plans for a fourth movie, but did not\ndismiss the possibility entirely.[6][7][8]\n\nKinney replied to inquiries regarding the possibility of another sequel,\nstating, \"At present, we don’t have a fourth film in development, but you\nnever know!\"[8] When describing the likelihood of starring in another film in\nthe series, Gordon explained, \"_Dog Days_ most likely will be the last movie.\nThe main problem is [the cast] is getting older. You can't stop it. There's no\nway to temporarily stop us from changing and growing up. You know, that's the\nproblem because the characters are supposed to be timeless.\"[6]\n\nIn March 2013, Gordon stated in a Spreecast live stream that there would not\nbe a fourth live action film. Previously, Kinney had indicated that instead of\nmaking a live action film of the 3rd novel, _[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last\nStraw](/wiki/Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid:_The_Last_Straw \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The\nLast Straw\")_ , instead he would like to see _[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin\nFever](/wiki/Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid:_Cabin_Fever \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin\nFever\")_ adapted into an animated film, stating in an interview, \"I hope that\nit gets made into an animated movie. but I'd really like to see it turn into\nan animated television special.\"\n\n### Pre-production\n\nOn July 29, 2016, it was announced that a fourth live-action _[Diary of a\nWimpy Kid](/wiki/Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\")_ film was in\nproduction, and will have a completely different cast, as many of the members\nfrom the original cast were too old and have outgrown from their\nroles.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] [Jason Drucker](/wiki/Jason_Drucker \"Jason Drucker\") and Owen\nAsztalos portray Greg and Rowley, with [David\nBowers](/wiki/David_Bowers_\\(director\\) \"David Bowers \\(director\\)\") returning\nas the director. [Alicia Silverstone](/wiki/Alicia_Silverstone \"Alicia\nSilverstone\") and [Tom Everett Scott](/wiki/Tom_Everett_Scott \"Tom Everett\nScott\") portray Greg's parents, Susan and Frank, and [Charlie\nWright](/wiki/Charlie_Wright_\\(actor\\) \"Charlie Wright \\(actor\\)\") portrays\nGreg's older brother\nRodrick.[[4]](/wiki/Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid_\\(film_series\\)#cite_note-4 \"Diary of\na Wimpy Kid \\(film series\\)\")\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming of _The Long Haul_ began on September 20, 2016, in\n[Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta \"Atlanta\"), and concluded on November 18, 2016.\n\n### Cultural references\n\nThe film somewhat acts as a [parody film](/wiki/Parody_film \"Parody film\"),\nreferencing two films directed by [Alfred Hitchcock](/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock\n\"Alfred Hitchcock\"). The film in one scene parodies the film _[The\nBirds](/wiki/The_Birds_\\(film\\) \"The Birds \\(film\\)\")_ , where the Heffley\nfamily getting mauled by seagulls. The film also parodies the film\n_[Psycho](/wiki/Psycho_\\(1960_film\\) \"Psycho \\(1960 film\\)\")_ in the third\nact, where Greg Heffley is caught by Mr. Beardo in the shower, which Greg is\nstuck in, which Mr. Beardo nearly catches him, and wet mud goes down the\ndrain. Additionally, _Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul_ also referenced a\nscene of the film _[Are We There Yet?](/wiki/Are_We_There_Yet%3F_\\(film\\) \"Are\nWe There Yet? \\(film\\)\")_.\n\n## Release\n\nThe film was released on May 17, 2017, in the Philippines, May 19, 2017, in\nthe United States, and May 20, 2017, in the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\").[4]\n\n### Trailer reactions\n\nOn February 23, 2017, a theatrical poster and teaser trailer were released,\nand the following month, the official trailer was released. Both trailers\nreceived negative feedback from fans for its recasting of the main characters,\nmost notably Charlie Wright as Rodrick. To further express their outrage, the\nfans took to social media and started the hashtag \"#NotMyRodrick\" (a parody of\nthe \"#NotMyPresident\" trend that followed the election of [U.S.\npresident](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\") [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\")), which has spawned\ncountless online memes. Other hashtags included \"#NotMyHeffleys\" and\n\"#NotMyRowley\".[9]\n\nBoth trailers received significant backlash from audiences, and the official\ntrailer received over 43 thousand dislikes, compared to only 8 thousand\nlikes.[10]\n\n### Box office\n\nAs of August 12,\n2017[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid:_The_Long_Haul_\\(film\\)&action=edit),\n_Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul_ had grossed $20.7 million in the United\nStates and Canada and $17.5 million in other countries for a worldwide total\nof $38.2 million, against a production budget of $22 million thus making the\nfilm the lowest grossing film of the _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_ series.[2]\n\nIn North America, the film was released alongside _[Everything,\nEverything](/wiki/Everything,_Everything_\\(film\\) \"Everything, Everything\n\\(film\\)\")_ and _[Alien: Covenant](/wiki/Alien:_Covenant \"Alien: Covenant\")_ ,\nand was initially projected to gross around $12 million from 3,129 theaters\nduring its opening weekend.[3] However, after grossing $2 million on its first\nday, projections were lowered to $7 million. It ended up finishing with $7.1\nmillion, placing 6th at the box office and marking the lowest opening of the\nfranchise.[11]\n\n### Critical response\n\n_Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul_ has received mostly negative reviews. On\n[review aggregator](/wiki/Review_aggregator \"Review aggregator\") website\n[Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\"), the film has an\napproval rating of 20% based on 65 reviews and an average rating of 4.2/10.\nThe site's critical consensus reads, \"With an all-new cast but the same\njuvenile humor, _Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul_ finds the franchise\nstill stuck in arrested – and largely unfunny – development.\"[12] On\n[Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\"), the film has a score of 39 out of\n100 based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[13]\nAudiences polled by [CinemaScore](/wiki/CinemaScore \"CinemaScore\") gave the\nfilm an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[14]\n\n### Home media\n\n_Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul_ was released on [Digital\nHD](/wiki/Digital_distribution \"Digital distribution\") from [Amazon\nVideo](/wiki/Amazon_Video \"Amazon Video\") and [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\")\non August 1, 2017, and on [Blu-ray](/wiki/Blu-ray \"Blu-ray\") and\n[DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") on August 8, 2017.[15][16]\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Rechtshaffen, Michael (May 15, 2017).
