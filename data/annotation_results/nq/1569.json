The term can also denote an estimate of the\nmaximum amount of time that a member of a given [species](/wiki/Species\n\"Species\") could survive between birth and death, provided circumstances that\nare optimal to that member's [longevity](/wiki/Longevity \"Longevity\").\n\nMost living species have at least one upper limit on the number of times the\n[cells](/wiki/Cell_\\(biology\\) \"Cell \\(biology\\)\") of a member can\n[divide](/wiki/Mitosis \"Mitosis\"). This is called the [Hayflick\nlimit](/wiki/Hayflick_limit \"Hayflick limit\"), although number of cell\ndivisions does not strictly control lifespan.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Definition\n  * 2 In humans\n  * 3 In other animals\n    * 3.1 Exceptions\n  * 4 In plants\n  * 5 Increasing maximum life span\n  * 6 Correlation with DNA repair capacity\n  * 7 Research data\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nDefinition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maximum_life_span&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Definition\")]\n\nIn animal studies, maximum span is often taken to be the [mean life\nspan](/wiki/Mean_life_span \"Mean life span\") of the most long-lived 10% of a\ngiven [cohort](/wiki/Cohort_study \"Cohort study\"). By another definition,\nhowever, maximum life span corresponds to the age at which the oldest known\nmember of a [species](/wiki/Species \"Species\") or experimental group has died.\nCalculation of the maximum life span in the latter sense depends upon initial\nsample size.[1]\n\n_Maximum life span_ contrasts with _[mean life span](/wiki/Mean_life_span\n\"Mean life span\") ([average life span](/wiki/Average_life_span \"Average life\nspan\")_, _[life expectancy](/wiki/Life_expectancy \"Life expectancy\"))_, and\n_[longevity](/wiki/Longevity \"Longevity\")_. Mean life span varies with\nsusceptibility to disease, [accident](/wiki/Accident \"Accident\"),\n[suicide](/wiki/Suicide \"Suicide\") and [homicide](/wiki/Murder \"Murder\"),\nwhereas maximum life span is determined by \"rate of aging\".[2] Longevity\nrefers only to the characteristics of the especially long lived members of a\npopulation, such as infirmities as they age or _[compression of\nmorbidity](/wiki/Compression_of_morbidity \"Compression of morbidity\")_ , and\nnot the specific life span of an individual.\n\n## In humans[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maximum_life_span&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: In humans\")]\n\nMain articles: [Oldest people](/wiki/Oldest_people \"Oldest people\") and [List\nof the verified oldest people](/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people \"List\nof the verified oldest people\")\n\nThe [longest-living person](/wiki/Oldest_people \"Oldest people\") whose dates\nof birth and death were verified to the modern norms of _[Guinness World\nRecords](/wiki/Guinness_World_Records \"Guinness World Records\")_ and the\n[Gerontology Research Group](/wiki/Gerontology_Research_Group \"Gerontology\nResearch Group\") was [Jeanne Calment](/wiki/Jeanne_Calment \"Jeanne Calment\")\n(1875-1997), a [French](/wiki/France \"France\") woman who lived to 122.\nReduction of infant mortality has accounted for most of the increased average\nlife span [longevity](/wiki/Longevity \"Longevity\"), but since the 1960s\n[mortality rates](/wiki/Mortality_rate \"Mortality rate\") among those over 80\nyears have decreased by about 1.5% per year. \"The progress being made in\nlengthening lifespans and postponing [senescence](/wiki/Senescence\n\"Senescence\") is entirely due to medical and public-health efforts, rising\nstandards of living, better education, healthier nutrition and more salubrious\nlifestyles.\"[3] Animal studies suggest that further lengthening of human\nlifespan could be achieved through \"[calorie restriction\nmimetic](/wiki/Caloric_restriction_mimetic \"Caloric restriction mimetic\")\"\ndrugs or by directly reducing food consumption. Although calorie restriction\nhas not been proven to extend the maximum human life span, as of 2014, results\nin ongoing primate studies have demonstrated that the assumptions derived from\nrodents are valid in primates as well [Reference: Nature 1 April 2014].[4]\n\nNo fixed theoretical limit to human longevity is apparent today.[5][6] \"A\nfundamental question in aging research is whether humans and other species\npossess an immutable life-span limit.\"[7] \"The assumption that the maximum\nhuman life span is fixed has been justified, [but] is invalid in a number of\nanimal models and ... may become invalid for humans as well.\"[8] Studies in\nthe [biodemography of human longevity](/wiki/Biodemography_of_human_longevity\n\"Biodemography of human longevity\") indicate a _late-life mortality\ndeceleration law_ : that death rates level off at advanced ages to a late-life\nmortality plateau. That is, there is no fixed upper limit to human longevity,\nor fixed maximal human lifespan.[9] This law was first quantified in 1939,\nwhen researchers found that the one-year probability of death at advanced age\nasymptotically approaches a limit of 44% for women and 54% for men.[10]\n\nScientists have observed that a person's [VO2max](/wiki/VO2_max \"VO2 max\")\nvalue (a measure of the volume of oxygen flow to the cardiac muscle) decreases\nas a function of age. Therefore, the maximum lifespan of a person could be\ndetermined by calculating when the person's VO2max value drops below the basal\nmetabolic rate necessary to sustain life, which is approximately 3\n[ml](/wiki/Millilitre \"Millilitre\") per [kg](/wiki/Kilogram \"Kilogram\") per\nminute.[11][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\")_] On the basis of this hypothesis, athletes with a VO2max value\nbetween 50 and 60 at age 20 would be expected \"to live for 100 to 125 years,\nprovided they maintained their physical activity so that their rate of decline\nin VO2max remained constant\".[12]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Age_dynamics_of_the_body_mass.svg/220px-\nAge_dynamics_of_the_body_mass.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Age_dynamics_of_the_body_mass.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Age_dynamics_of_the_body_mass.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAverage and commonly accepted maximum lifespans correspond to the extremums of\nthe body mass (1, 2) and mass normalized to height (3, 4) of men (1, 3) and\nwomen (2, 4).[13]\n\nA theoretical study suggested the maximum human lifespan to be around 125\nyears using a modified [stretched exponential\nfunction](/wiki/Stretched_exponential_function \"Stretched exponential\nfunction\") for human survival curves.[14] The analysis of dynamics of the body\nmass in human population indicates extremums, which correspond to mean (70-75\nyears), the commonly accepted maximum (100–110 years) and maximum known\n(140–160 years) lifespan.[13] In another study, researchers claimed that there\nexists a maximum lifespan for humans, and that the human maximal lifespan has\nbeen declining since the\n1990s.[15][_[dubious](/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement\n\"Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute\") – [discuss](/wiki/Talk:Maximum_life_span#Dubious\n\"Talk:Maximum life span\")_] This study is now disputed on the basis of simple\ncoding errors and biased sampling.[16] This study also supports a continuing\nincrease in both theoretical and observed upper human lifespan, based on\nobserved data from 200 national populations. However, a theoretical study also\nsuggested that the maximum human [life expectancy](/wiki/Life_expectancy \"Life\nexpectancy\") at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ,\nwhich is around 104 years.[17]\n\nThe United Nations has undertaken an important [Bayesian sensitivity analysis\nof global population burden based on life expectancy projection at birth in\nfuture\ndecades](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_TechnicalPaperNo7.pdf).\nThe 2017 95% prediction interval of 2090 average life expectancy rises as high\nas +6 (106, in Century Representation Form) by 2090, with dramatic, ongoing,\nlayered consequences on world population and demography should that happen.\nThe prediction interval is extremely wide, and the United Nations can not be\ncertain. Organizations like the [Methuselah\nFoundation](/wiki/Methuselah_Foundation \"Methuselah Foundation\") are working\ntoward an end to senescence and practically unlimited human lifespan. If\nsuccessful, the demographic implications for human population will be greater\nin effective multiplier terms than any experienced in the last five centuries\nif maximum lifespan remains unlimited by law.\n\n## In other\nanimals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maximum_life_span&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: In other animals\")]\n\nMain article: [List of longest-living organisms](/wiki/List_of_longest-\nliving_organisms \"List of longest-living organisms\")\n\nSmall animals such as [birds](/wiki/Bird \"Bird\") and\n[squirrels](/wiki/Squirrel \"Squirrel\") rarely live to their maximum life span,\nusually dying of [accidents](/wiki/Accident \"Accident\"),\n[disease](/wiki/Disease \"Disease\") or [predation](/wiki/Predation\n\"Predation\").\n\nThe maximum life span of most species is documented in the Anage\nrepository.[18]\n\nMaximum life span is usually longer for species that are larger or have\neffective defenses against predation, such as bird flight,[19] chemical\ndefenses[20] or living in social groups.[21]\n\nThe differences in life span between species demonstrate the role of\n[genetics](/wiki/Genetics \"Genetics\") in determining maximum life span (\"rate\nof aging\").

[Rats](/wiki/Rat \"Rat\"),\n[mice](/wiki/Mouse \"Mouse\"), and [hamsters](/wiki/Hamster \"Hamster\")\nexperience maximum life-span extension from a diet that contains all of the\nnutrients but only 40–60% of the calories that the animals consume when they\ncan eat as much as they want.

To date, both in absolute and relative terms, these\nAmes and Snell mice have the maximum lifespan of any mouse not on caloric\nrestriction (see below on GhR). Mutations/knockout of other genes affecting\nthe GH/IGF1 axis, such as Lit, Ghr and Irs1 have also shown extension in\nlifespan, but much more modest both in relative and absolute terms.

The theory that DNA damage is the primary cause of aging,\nand thus a principal determinant of maximum life span, has attracted increased\ninterest in recent years. This is based, in part, on evidence in human and\nmouse that inherited deficiencies in DNA repair genes often cause accelerated\naging.[52][53][54] There is also substantial evidence that DNA damage\naccumulates with age in mammalian tissues, such as those of the brain, muscle,\nliver and kidney (reviewed by Bernstein et al.[55] and see [DNA damage theory\nof aging](/wiki/DNA_damage_theory_of_aging \"DNA damage theory of aging\") and\n[DNA damage (naturally occurring)](/wiki/DNA_damage_\\(naturally_occurring\\)\n\"DNA damage \\(naturally occurring\\)\")). One expectation of the theory (that\nDNA damage is the primary cause of aging) is that among species with differing\nmaximum life spans, the capacity to repair DNA damage should correlate with\nlifespan. The first experimental test of this idea was by Hart and Setlow[56]\nwho measured the capacity of cells from seven different mammalian species to\ncarry out DNA repair. They found that nucleotide excision repair capability\nincreased systematically with species longevity. This correlation was striking\nand stimulated a series of 11 additional experiments in different laboratories\nover succeeding years on the relationship of nucleotide excision repair and\nlife span in mammalian species (reviewed by Bernstein and Bernstein[57]). In\ngeneral, the findings of these studies indicated a good correlation between\nnucleotide excision repair capacity and life span. The association between\nnucleotide excision repair capability and longevity is strengthened by the\nevidence that defects in nucleotide excision repair proteins in humans and\nrodents cause features of premature aging, as reviewed by Diderich.[53]\n\nFurther support for the theory that DNA damage is the primary cause of aging\ncomes from study of [Poly ADP ribose\npolymerases](/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase \"Poly ADP ribose polymerase\")\n(PARPs). PARPs are enzymes that are activated by DNA strand breaks and play a\nrole in DNA base excision repair. Burkle et al. reviewed evidence that PARPs,\nand especially PARP-1, are involved in maintaining mammalian longevity.[58]\nThe life span of 13 mammalian species correlated with poly(ADP ribosyl)ation\ncapability measured in mononuclear cells. Furthermore, lymphoblastoid cell\nlines from peripheral blood lymphocytes of humans over age 100 had a\nsignificantly higher poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capability than control cell lines\nfrom younger individuals.\n\n## Research\ndata[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maximum_life_span&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Research data\")]\n\n  * A comparison of the heart [mitochondria](/wiki/Mitochondria \"Mitochondria\") in rats (7-year maximum life span) and pigeons (35-year maximum life span) showed that pigeon mitochondria leak fewer [free-radicals](/wiki/Radical_\\(chemistry\\) \"Radical \\(chemistry\\)\") than rat mitochondria, despite the fact that both animals have similar [metabolic rate](/wiki/Metabolic_rate \"Metabolic rate\") and [cardiac](/wiki/Cardiac \"Cardiac\") output[59]\n  * For [mammals](/wiki/Mammal \"Mammal\") there is a direct relationship between mitochondrial membrane fatty acid saturation and maximum life span[60]\n  * Studies of the [liver](/wiki/Liver \"Liver\") [lipids](/wiki/Lipid \"Lipid\") of [mammals](/wiki/Mammal \"Mammal\") and a bird (pigeon) show an inverse relationship between maximum life span and number of [double bonds](/wiki/Double_bond \"Double bond\")[61]\n  * Selected species of birds and mammals show an inverse relationship between [telomere](/wiki/Telomere \"Telomere\") rate of change (shortening) and maximum life span[62]\n  * Maximum life span correlates negatively with [antioxidant](/wiki/Antioxidant \"Antioxidant\") [enzyme](/wiki/Enzyme \"Enzyme\") levels and [free-radicals](/wiki/Radical_\\(chemistry\\) \"Radical \\(chemistry\\)\") production and positively with rate of [DNA repair](/wiki/DNA_repair \"DNA repair\")[63]\n  * Female mammals express more Mn−SOD and glutathione peroxidase antioxidant enzymes than males.
