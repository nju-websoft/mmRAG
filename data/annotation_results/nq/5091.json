An [anthropomorphic](/wiki/Anthropomorphism \"Anthropomorphism\") mouse\nwho typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey\nis one of the world's most recognizable characters.\n\nMickey first appeared in the short _[Plane Crazy](/wiki/Plane_Crazy \"Plane\nCrazy\")_ , debuting publicly in the [short film](/wiki/Short_film \"Short\nfilm\") _[Steamboat Willie](/wiki/Steamboat_Willie \"Steamboat Willie\")_ (1928),\none of the first [sound cartoons](/wiki/Sound_film \"Sound film\").

Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the [Academy Award\nfor Best Animated Short Film](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Animated_Short_Film\n\"Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film\"), one of which, _[Lend a\nPaw](/wiki/Lend_a_Paw \"Lend a Paw\")_ , won the award in\n[1942](/wiki/14th_Academy_Awards \"14th Academy Awards\"). In 1978, Mickey\nbecame the first cartoon character to have a star on the [Hollywood Walk of\nFame](/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame \"Hollywood Walk of Fame\").\n\nBeginning in 1930, Mickey has also been featured extensively as a [comic\nstrip](/wiki/Comic_strip \"Comic strip\") character. His self-titled newspaper\nstrip, drawn primarily by [Floyd Gottfredson](/wiki/Floyd_Gottfredson \"Floyd\nGottfredson\"), ran for 45 years. Mickey has also appeared in comic books such\nas [Disney Italy](/wiki/Disney_comics#Italy \"Disney comics\")'s\n_[Topolino](/wiki/Topolino \"Topolino\")_ , _[MM Mickey Mouse Mystery\nMagazine](/wiki/MM_Mickey_Mouse_Mystery_Magazine \"MM Mickey Mouse Mystery\nMagazine\")_ , and _[Wizards of Mickey](/wiki/Wizards_of_Mickey \"Wizards of\nMickey\")_ , and in television series such as _[The Mickey Mouse\nClub](/wiki/The_Mickey_Mouse_Club \"The Mickey Mouse Club\")_ (1955–1996) and\nothers. He also appears in other media such as video games as well as\nmerchandising and is a meetable character at the Disney parks.\n\nMickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend [Minnie\nMouse](/wiki/Minnie_Mouse \"Minnie Mouse\"), his pet dog\n[Pluto](/wiki/Pluto_\\(Disney\\) \"Pluto \\(Disney\\)\"), his friends [Donald\nDuck](/wiki/Donald_Duck \"Donald Duck\") and [Goofy](/wiki/Goofy \"Goofy\"), and\nhis nemesis [Pete](/wiki/Pete_\\(Disney\\) \"Pete \\(Disney\\)\"), among others (see\n[Mickey Mouse universe](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_universe \"Mickey Mouse universe\")).\nThough originally characterized as a mischievous [antihero](/wiki/Antihero\n\"Antihero\"), Mickey was rebranded over time as an [everyman](/wiki/Everyman\n\"Everyman\"), usually seen as a flawed, but adventurous hero. In 2009, Disney\nbegan to rebrand the character again by putting less emphasis on his pleasant,\ncheerful side and reintroducing the more mischievous and adventurous sides of\nhis personality, beginning with the video game _[Epic\nMickey](/wiki/Epic_Mickey \"Epic Mickey\")_.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Origin\n  * 2 Design\n  * 3 Animation history\n    * 3.1 Debut (1928)\n    * 3.2 Black and white films (1929–1935)\n    * 3.3 Color films (1935–1953)\n    * 3.4 Television and later films\n  * 4 Voice actors\n  * 5 Mickey in comics\n  * 6 Merchandising\n  * 7 Mickey at the Disney parks\n  * 8 Mickey in video games\n  * 9 Awards and honors\n  * 10 Social impact\n    * 10.1 Use in politics\n    * 10.2 Pejorative use of Mickey's name\n    * 10.3 Parodies and criticism\n  * 11 Legal issues\n    * 11.1 _Walt Disney Productions v.

But Mintz instead demanded that\nWalt take a 20 percent budget cut, and as leverage, he reminded Disney that\nUniversal owned the character, and revealed that he had already signed most of\nDisney's current employees to his new contract. Angrily, Disney refused the\ndeal and returned to produce the final Oswald cartoons he contractually owed\nMintz. Disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to\nrestart from scratch. The new Disney Studio initially consisted of animator\n[Ub Iwerks](/wiki/Ub_Iwerks \"Ub Iwerks\") and a loyal apprentice artist, [Les\nClark](/wiki/Les_Clark \"Les Clark\"), who together with [Wilfred\nJackson](/wiki/Wilfred_Jackson \"Wilfred Jackson\") were among the few who\nremained loyal to Walt. One lesson Disney learned from the experience was to\nthereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters\nproduced by his company.\n\nIn the spring of 1928, Disney asked Ub Iwerks to start drawing up new\ncharacter ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of various animals, such as dogs and\ncats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were\nalso rejected. They would later turn up as [Clarabelle\nCow](/wiki/Clarabelle_Cow \"Clarabelle Cow\") and [Horace\nHorsecollar](/wiki/Horace_Horsecollar \"Horace Horsecollar\"). A male frog was\nalso rejected. It would later show up in Iwerks' own _[Flip the\nFrog](/wiki/Flip_the_Frog \"Flip the Frog\")_ series.[5] Walt Disney got the\ninspiration for Mickey Mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram\nStudio in Kansas City, Missouri.[6] In 1925, [Hugh Harman](/wiki/Hugh_Harman\n\"Hugh Harman\") drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney.\nThese inspired Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney.[5]\n\"[Mortimer Mouse](/wiki/Mortimer_Mouse \"Mortimer Mouse\")\" had been Disney's\noriginal name for the character before his wife, Lillian, convinced him to\nchange it, and ultimately Mickey Mouse came to be.[7][8] The actor [Mickey\nRooney](/wiki/Mickey_Rooney \"Mickey Rooney\") claimed that, during his Mickey\nMcGuire days, he met cartoonist Walt Disney at the Warner Brothers studio, and\nthat Disney was inspired to name Mickey Mouse after him.[9] This claim,\nhowever, has been debunked by Disney historian Jim Korkis, since at the time\nof Mickey Mouse's development, Disney Studios had been located on Hyperion\nAvenue for several years, and Walt Disney never kept an office or other\nworking space at Warner Brothers, having no professional relationship with\nWarner Brothers, as the Alice Comedies and Oswald cartoons were distributed by\nUniversal.[10][11]\n\n## Design\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Disney employees\n[John Hench](/wiki/John_Hench \"John Hench\") and [Marc\nDavis](/wiki/Marc_Davis_\\(animator\\) \"Marc Davis \\(animator\\)\") believed that\nthis design was part of Mickey's success as it made him more dynamic and\nappealing to audiences.\n\nMickey's circular design is most noticeable in his ears. In animation in the\n1940s, Mickey's ears were animated in a more realistic perspective. Later,\nthey were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way Mickey was\nfacing. This made Mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an\nunofficial personal trademark. The circular rule later created a dilemma for\ntoy creators who had to recreate a three-dimensional Mickey.\n\nIn 1938, animator [Fred Moore](/wiki/Fred_Moore_\\(animator\\) \"Fred Moore\n\\(animator\\)\") redesigned Mickey's body away from its circular design to a\npear-shaped design. Colleague [Ward Kimball](/wiki/Ward_Kimball \"Ward\nKimball\") praised Moore for being the first animator to break from Mickey's\n\"[rubber hose](/wiki/Rubber_hose_animation \"Rubber hose animation\"), round\ncircle\" design. Although Moore himself was nervous at first about changing\nMickey, Walt Disney liked the new design and told Moore \"that's the way I want\nMickey to be drawn from now on.\"\n\nEach of Mickey's hands has only three fingers and a thumb. Disney said that\nthis was both an artistic and financial decision, explaining \"Artistically\nfive digits are too many for a mouse. His hand would look like a bunch of\nbananas. Financially, not having an extra finger in each of 45,000 drawings\nthat make up a six and one-half minute short has saved the Studio millions.\"\nIn the film _[The Opry House](/wiki/The_Opry_House \"The Opry House\")_ (1929),\nMickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally\nblack hands against his black body. The use of white gloves would prove to be\nan influential design for cartoon characters, particularly with later Disney\ncharacters, but also with non-Disney characters such as [Bugs\nBunny](/wiki/Bugs_Bunny \"Bugs Bunny\"), [Woody\nWoodpecker](/wiki/Woody_Woodpecker \"Woody Woodpecker\"), [Mighty\nMouse](/wiki/Mighty_Mouse \"Mighty Mouse\"), and [Mario](/wiki/Mario \"Mario\").\n\nMickey's eyes, as drawn in _[Plane Crazy](/wiki/Plane_Crazy \"Plane Crazy\")_\nand _[The Gallopin' Gaucho](/wiki/The_Gallopin%27_Gaucho \"The Gallopin'\nGaucho\")_, were large and white with black outlines. In _[Steamboat\nWillie](/wiki/Steamboat_Willie \"Steamboat Willie\"),_ the bottom portion of the\nblack outlines was removed, although the upper edges still contrasted with his\nhead. Mickey's eyes were later re-imagined as only consisting of the small\nblack dots which were originally his pupils, while what were the upper edges\nof his eyes became a hairline. This is evident only when Mickey blinks. Fred\nMoore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave\nhis face a Caucasian skin tone instead of plain white. This new Mickey first\nappeared in 1938 on the cover of a party program, and in animation the\nfollowing year with the release of _[The Pointer](/wiki/The_Pointer \"The\nPointer\")_.[15] Mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in _[The Simple\nThings](/wiki/The_Simple_Things \"The Simple Things\")_ (1953) and in the comic\nstrip, although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances.\n\nSome of Mickey's early appearance, particularly the gloves, and facial\ncharacteristics, evolved from [blackface](/wiki/Blackface \"Blackface\")\ncaricatures used in [minstrel shows](/wiki/Minstrel_show \"Minstrel\nshow\").[16][17][18][19][20]\n\nBesides Mickey's gloves and shoes, he typically wears only a pair of shorts\nwith two large buttons in the front. Before Mickey was seen regularly in color\nanimation, Mickey's shorts were either red or a dull blue-green. With the\nadvent of Mickey's color films, the shorts were always red. When Mickey is not\nwearing his red shorts, he is often still wearing red clothing such as a red\nbandmaster coat (_[The Band Concert](/wiki/The_Band_Concert \"The Band\nConcert\")_ , _[The Mickey Mouse Club](/wiki/The_Mickey_Mouse_Club \"The Mickey\nMouse Club\")_), red overalls (_[Clock Cleaners](/wiki/Clock_Cleaners \"Clock\nCleaners\")_ , _[Boat Builders](/wiki/Boat_Builders_\\(film\\) \"Boat Builders\n\\(film\\)\")_), a red cloak (_[Fantasia](/wiki/Fantasia_\\(1940_film\\) \"Fantasia\n\\(1940 film\\)\")_ , _[Fun and Fancy Free](/wiki/Fun_and_Fancy_Free \"Fun and\nFancy Free\")_), a red coat (_[Squatter's\nRights](/wiki/Squatter%27s_Rights_\\(film\\) \"Squatter's Rights \\(film\\)\")_,\n_[Mickey's Christmas Carol](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Christmas_Carol \"Mickey's\nChristmas Carol\")_), or a red shirt (_Mickey Down Under_ , _[The Simple\nThings](/wiki/The_Simple_Things \"The Simple Things\")_).\n\n## Animation history\n\nSee also: [Mickey Mouse film series](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_film_series \"Mickey\nMouse film series\")\n\n### Debut (1928)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4e/Steamboat-\nwillie.jpg/220px-Steamboat-willie.jpg)](/wiki/File:Steamboat-willie.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Steamboat-willie.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMickey's first appearance in _[Steamboat Willie](/wiki/Steamboat_Willie\n\"Steamboat Willie\")_ (1928).\n\nDisney had Ub Iwerks secretly begin animating a new cartoon while still under\ncontract with Universal. The cartoon was co-directed by Walt Disney and Ub\nIwerks. Iwerks was the main [animator](/wiki/Animator \"Animator\") for the\nshort and reportedly spent six weeks working on it. In fact, Iwerks was the\nmain animator for every Disney short released in 1928 and 1929. Hugh Harman\nand [Rudolf Ising](/wiki/Rudolf_Ising \"Rudolf Ising\") also assisted Disney\nduring those years. They had already signed their contracts with Charles\nMintz, but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for\nthe time being they were still employed by Disney. This short would be the\nlast they animated under this somewhat awkward situation.[21]\n\nMickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short _[Plane\nCrazy](/wiki/Plane_Crazy \"Plane Crazy\")_ , on May 15, 1928, but it failed to\nimpress the audience and to add insult to injury, Walt could not find a\ndistributor. Though understandably disappointed, Walt went on to produce a\nsecond Mickey short, _[The Gallopin' Gaucho](/wiki/The_Gallopin%27_Gaucho \"The\nGallopin' Gaucho\")_, which was also not released for lack of a\ndistributor.[22]\n\n_[Steamboat Willie](/wiki/Steamboat_Willie \"Steamboat Willie\")_ was first\nreleased on November 18, 1928, in New York. It was co-directed by Walt Disney\nand Ub Iwerks. Iwerks again served as the head animator, assisted by Johnny\nCannon, [Les Clark](/wiki/Les_Clark \"Les Clark\"), Wilfred Jackson and [Dick\nLundy](/wiki/Dick_Lundy_\\(animator\\) \"Dick Lundy \\(animator\\)\"). This short\nwas intended as a parody of [Buster Keaton](/wiki/Buster_Keaton \"Buster\nKeaton\")'s _[Steamboat Bill, Jr.](/wiki/Steamboat_Bill,_Jr. \"Steamboat Bill,\nJr.\")_ , first released on May 12 of the same year. Although it was the third\nMickey cartoon produced, it was the first to find a distributor, and thus is\nconsidered by The Disney Company as Mickey's debut. _Willie_ featured changes\nto Mickey's appearance (in particular, simplifying his eyes to large dots)\nthat established his look for later cartoons and in numerous Walt Disney\nfilms.[23][24]\n\nThe cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the\naction. [Fleischer Studios](/wiki/Fleischer_Studios \"Fleischer Studios\"),\nheaded by brothers [Dave](/wiki/Dave_Fleischer \"Dave Fleischer\") and [Max\nFleischer](/wiki/Max_Fleischer \"Max Fleischer\"), had already released a number\nof sound cartoons using the [DeForest](/wiki/Lee_De_Forest \"Lee De Forest\")\nsystem in the mid-1920s. However, these cartoons did not keep the sound\nsynchronized throughout the film. For _Willie_ , Disney had the sound recorded\nwith a [click track](/wiki/Click_track \"Click track\") that kept the musicians\non the beat. This precise timing is apparent during the \"Turkey in the Straw\"\nsequence when Mickey's actions exactly match the accompanying instruments.\nAnimation historians have long debated who had served as the\n[composer](/wiki/Composer \"Composer\") for the film's original music. This role\nhas been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson, [Carl\nStalling](/wiki/Carl_Stalling \"Carl Stalling\") and Bert Lewis, but\nidentification remains uncertain. Walt Disney himself was [voice\nactor](/wiki/Voice_actor \"Voice actor\") for both Mickey and Minnie and would\nremain the source of Mickey's voice through 1946 for theatrical cartoons.\n[Jimmy MacDonald](/wiki/Jimmy_MacDonald_\\(sound_effects_artist\\) \"Jimmy\nMacDonald \\(sound effects artist\\)\") took over the role in 1946, but Walt\nprovided Mickey's voice again from 1955 to 1959 for _[The Mickey Mouse\nClub](/wiki/The_Mickey_Mouse_Club \"The Mickey Mouse Club\")_ television series\non [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\").\n\nAudiences at the time of _Steamboat Willie '_s release were reportedly\nimpressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes. [Sound\nfilms](/wiki/Sound_film \"Sound film\") or \"talkies\" were still considered\ninnovative. The first feature-length movie with dialogue sequences, _[The Jazz\nSinger](/wiki/The_Jazz_Singer_\\(1927_film\\) \"The Jazz Singer \\(1927 film\\)\")_\nstarring [Al Jolson](/wiki/Al_Jolson \"Al Jolson\"), was released on October 6,\n1927. Within a year of its success, most United States movie theaters had\ninstalled sound film equipment. Walt Disney apparently intended to take\nadvantage of this new trend and, arguably, managed to succeed. Most other\ncartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to\neffectively act as competition to Disney. As a result, Mickey would soon\nbecome the most prominent animated character of the time. Walt Disney soon\nworked on adding sound to both _Plane Crazy_ and _The Gallopin ' Gaucho_\n(which had originally been silent releases) and their new release added to\nMickey's success and popularity. A fourth Mickey short, _The Barn Dance_ , was\nalso put into production; however, Mickey does not actually speak until _[The\nKarnival Kid](/wiki/The_Karnival_Kid \"The Karnival Kid\")_ in 1929 when his\nfirst spoken words were \"Hot dogs, Hot dogs!\" After _Steamboat Willie_ was\nreleased, Mickey became a close competitor to [Felix the\nCat](/wiki/Felix_the_Cat \"Felix the Cat\"), and his popularity would grow as he\nwas continuously featured in sound cartoons. By 1929, Felix would lose\npopularity among theater audiences, and Pat Sullivan decided to produce all\nfuture Felix cartoons in sound as a result.[25] Unfortunately, audiences did\nnot respond well to Felix's transition to sound and by 1930, Felix had faded\nfrom the screen.[26]\n\n### Black and white films (1929–1935)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Mickey_and_Minnie_-\n_Building_a_Building.png/220px-Mickey_and_Minnie_-\n_Building_a_Building.png)](/wiki/File:Mickey_and_Minnie_-\n_Building_a_Building.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mickey_and_Minnie_-_Building_a_Building.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nMickey with [Minnie Mouse](/wiki/Minnie_Mouse \"Minnie Mouse\") in _[Building a\nBuilding](/wiki/Building_a_Building \"Building a Building\")_ (1933).\n\nIn Mickey's early films he was often characterized not as a hero, but as an\nineffective young suitor to [Minnie Mouse](/wiki/Minnie_Mouse \"Minnie Mouse\").\n_[The Barn Dance](/wiki/The_Barn_Dance \"The Barn Dance\")_ (March 14, 1929) is\nthe first time in which Mickey is turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete.\n\n_[The Opry House](/wiki/The_Opry_House \"The Opry House\")_ (March 28, 1929) was\nthe first time in which Mickey wore his white gloves. Mickey wears them in\nalmost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed\nsuit. The three lines on the back of Mickey's gloves represent\n[darts](/wiki/Dart_\\(sewing\\) \"Dart \\(sewing\\)\") in the gloves' fabric\nextending from between the digits of the hand, typical of glove design of the\nera.\n\n_[When the Cat's Away](/wiki/When_the_Cat%27s_Away_\\(1929_film\\) \"When the\nCat's Away \\(1929 film\\)\")_ (April 18, 1929), essentially a remake of the\n_[Alice Comedy](/wiki/Alice_Comedies \"Alice Comedies\")_ , \"Alice Rattled by\nRats\", was an unusual appearance for Mickey. Although Mickey and Minnie still\nmaintained their anthropomorphic characteristics, they were depicted as the\nsize of regular mice and living with a community many other mice as pests in a\nhome. Mickey and Minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their\nown setting. In appearances with real humans, Mickey has been shown to be\nabout two to three feet high.[27] The next Mickey short was also unusual.\n_[The Barnyard Battle](/wiki/The_Barnyard_Battle \"The Barnyard Battle\")_\n(April 25, 1929) was the only film to depict Mickey as a soldier and also the\nfirst to place him in combat. _[The Karnival Kid](/wiki/The_Karnival_Kid \"The\nKarnival Kid\")_ (1929) was the first time Mickey spoke. Before this he had\nonly whistled, laughed, and grunted. His first words were \"Hot dogs! Hot\ndogs!\" said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival. _Mickey 's Follies_\n(1929) introduced the song \"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo\" which would become the theme\nsong for _Mickey Mouse_ films for the next several years. The \"Minnie's Yoo-\nHoo\" song sequence was also later reused with different background animation\nas its own special short shown only at the commencement of 1930s theater-based\nMickey Mouse Clubs.[28][29] Mickey's dog [Pluto](/wiki/Pluto_\\(Disney\\) \"Pluto\n\\(Disney\\)\") first appeared as Mickey's pet in _The Moose Hunt_ (1931) after\npreviously appearing as Minnie's dog \"Rover\" in _The Picnic_ (1930).\n\n_[The Cactus Kid](/wiki/The_Cactus_Kid \"The Cactus Kid\")_ (April 11, 1930) was\nthe last film to be animated by [Ub Iwerks](/wiki/Ub_Iwerks \"Ub Iwerks\") at\nDisney. Shortly before the release of the film, Iwerks left to start his own\nstudio, bankrolled by Disney's then-distributor [Pat\nPowers](/wiki/Pat_Powers_\\(businessman\\) \"Pat Powers \\(businessman\\)\"). Powers\nand Disney had a falling out over money due Disney from the distribution deal.\nIt was in response to losing the right to distribute Disney's cartoons that\nPowers made the deal with Iwerks, who had long harbored a desire to head his\nown studio. The departure is considered a turning point in Mickey's career, as\nwell as that of Walt Disney. Walt lost the man who served as his closest\ncolleague and confidant since 1919. Mickey lost the man responsible for his\noriginal design and for the direction or animation of several of the shorts\nreleased till this point. Advertising for the early Mickey Mouse cartoons\ncredited them as \"A Walt Disney Comic, drawn by Ub Iwerks\". Later Disney\nCompany reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone.\n\nDisney and his remaining staff continued the production of the Mickey series,\nand he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks. As\nthe [Great Depression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\") progressed\nand Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen, Mickey's popularity would rise,\nand by 1932 The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members.[30] At the\n[5th Academy Awards](/wiki/5th_Academy_Awards \"5th Academy Awards\") in 1932,\nMickey received his first Academy Award nomination, received for _Mickey 's\nOrphans_ (1931). Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the\ncreation of Mickey Mouse. Despite being eclipsed by the Silly Symphonies short\nthe _[Three Little Pigs](/wiki/Three_Little_Pigs \"Three Little Pigs\")_ in\n1933, Mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too,\nuntil 1935, when polls showed that [Popeye](/wiki/Popeye \"Popeye\") was more\npopular than Mickey.[31][32][33] By 1934, Mickey merchandise had earned\n$600,000.00 a year.[34] In 1935, Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse\nClubs, due to administration problems.[35]\n\nAbout this time, story artists at Disney were finding it increasingly\ndifficult to write material for Mickey. As he had developed into a role model\nfor children, they were limited in the types of gags they could make. This led\nto Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing\nfor more emphasis on other characters. In _[Orphan's\nBenefit](/wiki/Orphan%27s_Benefit \"Orphan's Benefit\")_ (August 11, 1934)\nMickey first appeared with [Donald Duck](/wiki/Donald_Duck \"Donald Duck\") who\nhad been introduced earlier that year in the _[Silly\nSymphonies](/wiki/Silly_Symphonies \"Silly Symphonies\")_ series. The\ntempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and\nwould remain a recurring character in Mickey's cartoons.\n\n### Color films (1935–1953)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Mickey_-\n_The_Band_Concert.png/220px-Mickey_-\n_The_Band_Concert.png)](/wiki/File:Mickey_-_The_Band_Concert.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mickey_-_The_Band_Concert.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nMickey in _[The Band Concert](/wiki/The_Band_Concert \"The Band Concert\")_\n(1935).\n\nMickey first appeared animated in color in _[Parade of the Award\nNominees](/wiki/Parade_of_the_Award_Nominees \"Parade of the Award Nominees\")_\nin 1932, however, the film strip was created for the [5th Academy\nAwards](/wiki/5th_Academy_Awards \"5th Academy Awards\") ceremony and was not\nreleased to the public. Mickey's official first color film came in 1935 with\n_[The Band Concert](/wiki/The_Band_Concert \"The Band Concert\")_. The\n[Technicolor](/wiki/Technicolor \"Technicolor\") film process was used in the\nfilm production. Here Mickey conducted the _William Tell Overture_ , but the\nband is swept up by a tornado. It is said that conductor [Arturo\nToscanini](/wiki/Arturo_Toscanini \"Arturo Toscanini\") so loved this short\nthat, upon first seeing it, he asked the projectionist to run it again. In\n1994, _The Band Concert_ was voted the third-greatest cartoon of all time in a\npoll of animation professionals. By colorizing and partially redesigning\nMickey, Walt would put Mickey back on top once again, and Mickey would reach\npopularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal.[36]\nAlso in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations\nfor creating Mickey.\n\nHowever, by 1938, the more manic [Donald Duck](/wiki/Donald_Duck \"Donald\nDuck\") would surpass the passive Mickey, resulting in a redesign of the mouse\nbetween 1938 and 1940 that put Mickey at the peak of his popularity.[36] The\nsecond half of the 1930s saw the character [Goofy](/wiki/Goofy \"Goofy\")\nreintroduced as a series regular. Together, Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy\nwould go on several adventures together. Several of the films by the comic\ntrio are some of Mickey's most critically acclaimed films, including _Mickey\n's Fire Brigade_ (1935), _[Moose Hunters](/wiki/Moose_Hunters \"Moose\nHunters\")_ (1937), _[Clock Cleaners](/wiki/Clock_Cleaners \"Clock Cleaners\")_\n(1937), _[Lonesome Ghosts](/wiki/Lonesome_Ghosts \"Lonesome Ghosts\")_ (1937),\n_[Boat Builders](/wiki/Boat_Builders_\\(film\\) \"Boat Builders \\(film\\)\")_\n(1938), and _[Mickey's Trailer](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Trailer \"Mickey's Trailer\")_\n(1938). Also during this era, Mickey would star in _[Brave Little\nTailor](/wiki/Brave_Little_Tailor \"Brave Little Tailor\")_ (1938), an\nadaptation of _[The Valiant Little Tailor](/wiki/The_Valiant_Little_Tailor\n\"The Valiant Little Tailor\")_ , which was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nMickey was redesigned by animator [Fred Moore](/wiki/Fred_Moore_\\(animator\\)\n\"Fred Moore \\(animator\\)\") which was first seen in _[The\nPointer](/wiki/The_Pointer \"The Pointer\")_ (1939). Instead of having solid\nblack eyes, Mickey was given white eyes with pupils, a Caucasian skin colored\nface, and a pear-shaped body. In the 40's, he changed once more in _[The\nLittle Whirlwind](/wiki/The_Little_Whirlwind \"The Little Whirlwind\")_ , where\nhe used his trademark pants for the last time in decades, lost his tail, got\nmore realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body\nanatomy. But this change would only last for a short period of time before\nreturning to the one in \"_The Pointer_ \", with the exception of his pants. In\nhis final theatrical cartoons in the 1950s, he was given eyebrows, which were\nremoved in the more recent cartoons.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Mickey_-\n_Fantasia.jpg/220px-Mickey_-_Fantasia.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mickey_-_Fantasia.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mickey_-_Fantasia.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMickey in _[Fantasia](/wiki/Fantasia_\\(1940_film\\) \"Fantasia \\(1940 film\\)\")_\n(1940).\n\nIn 1940 Mickey appeared in his first feature-length film,\n_[Fantasia](/wiki/Fantasia_\\(1940_film\\) \"Fantasia \\(1940 film\\)\")_. His\nscreen role as [The Sorcerer's Apprentice](/wiki/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice\n\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\"), set to the [symphonic poem](/wiki/Symphonic_poem\n\"Symphonic poem\") of the same name by [Paul Dukas](/wiki/Paul_Dukas \"Paul\nDukas\"), is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey's\nmost iconic roles. The segment features no dialogue at all, only the music.\nThe apprentice (Mickey), not willing to do his chores, puts on the sorcerer's\nmagic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom, which\ncauses the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up\na deep well using two buckets of water. When the well eventually overflows,\nMickey finds himself unable to control the broom, leading to a near-flood.\nAfter the segment ends, Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with\n[Leopold Stokowski](/wiki/Leopold_Stokowski \"Leopold Stokowski\"), who conducts\nall the music heard in _Fantasia_. Mickey has often been pictured in the red\nrobe and blue sorcerer's hat in merchandising. It was also featured into the\nclimax of [Fantasmic!](/wiki/Fantasmic! \"Fantasmic!\"), an attraction at the\nDisney theme parks.\n\nAfter 1940, Mickey's popularity would decline until his 1955 re-emergence as a\ndaily children's television personality.[37] Despite this, the character\ncontinued to appear regularly in animated shorts until 1943 (winning his only\ncompetitive Academy Award—with canine companion [Pluto](/wiki/Pluto_\\(Disney\\)\n\"Pluto \\(Disney\\)\")—for a short subject, _Lend a Paw_) and again from 1946 to\n1952.\n\nThe last regular installment of the _Mickey Mouse_ film series came in 1953\nwith _[The Simple Things](/wiki/The_Simple_Things \"The Simple Things\")_ in\nwhich Mickey and Pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls.\n\n### Television and later films\n\nIn the 1950s, Mickey became more known for his appearances on television,\nparticularly with _The Mickey Mouse Club_. Many of his theatrical cartoon\nshorts were rereleased on television series such as _Ink & Paint Club_,\nvarious forms of the [Walt Disney anthology television\nseries](/wiki/Walt_Disney_anthology_television_series \"Walt Disney anthology\ntelevision series\"), and on home video. Mickey returned to theatrical\nanimation in 1983 with _[Mickey's Christmas\nCarol](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Christmas_Carol \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\")_, an\nadaptation of [Charles Dickens](/wiki/Charles_Dickens \"Charles Dickens\")' _[A\nChristmas Carol](/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol \"A Christmas Carol\")_ in which Mickey\nplayed [Bob Cratchit](/wiki/Bob_Cratchit \"Bob Cratchit\"). This was followed up\nin 1990 with _[The Prince and the\nPauper](/wiki/The_Prince_and_the_Pauper_\\(1990_film\\) \"The Prince and the\nPauper \\(1990 film\\)\")_.\n\nThroughout the decades, Mickey Mouse competed with [Warner\nBros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\")' [Bugs Bunny](/wiki/Bugs_Bunny \"Bugs\nBunny\") for animated popularity. But in 1988, the two rivals finally shared\nscreen time in the [Robert Zemeckis](/wiki/Robert_Zemeckis \"Robert Zemeckis\")\n[Disney](/wiki/Disney \"Disney\")/[Amblin](/wiki/Amblin \"Amblin\") film _[Who\nFramed Roger Rabbit](/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit \"Who Framed Roger\nRabbit\")_. Disney and Warner signed an agreement stating that each character\nhad the same amount of screen time in the scene.\n\nSimilar to his animated inclusion into a live-action film on _Roger Rabbit_ ,\nMickey made a featured cameo appearance in the 1990 television special _[The\nMuppets at Walt Disney World](/wiki/The_Muppets_at_Walt_Disney_World \"The\nMuppets at Walt Disney World\")_ where he met [Kermit the\nFrog](/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog \"Kermit the Frog\"). The two are established in the\nstory as having been old friends. [The Muppets](/wiki/The_Muppets \"The\nMuppets\") have otherwise spoofed and referenced Mickey over a dozen times\nsince the 1970s. Eventually, The Muppets were purchased by the Walt Disney\nCompany in 2004.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a3/Mickey_-\n_House_of_Mouse.png/220px-Mickey_-_House_of_Mouse.png)](/wiki/File:Mickey_-\n_House_of_Mouse.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mickey_-_House_of_Mouse.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nMickey in _[Disney's House of Mouse](/wiki/Disney%27s_House_of_Mouse \"Disney's\nHouse of Mouse\")_ (2001–2003).\n\nHis most recent theatrical cartoon short was 2013's _[Get a\nHorse!](/wiki/Get_a_Horse! \"Get a Horse!\")_ which was preceded by 1995's\n_[Runaway Brain](/wiki/Runaway_Brain \"Runaway Brain\")_ , while from 1999 to\n2004, he appeared in direct-to-video features like _[Mickey's Once Upon a\nChristmas](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Once_Upon_a_Christmas \"Mickey's Once Upon a\nChristmas\")_, _[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three\nMusketeers](/wiki/Mickey,_Donald,_Goofy:_The_Three_Musketeers \"Mickey, Donald,\nGoofy: The Three Musketeers\")_ and the computer-animated _[Mickey's Twice Upon\na Christmas](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Twice_Upon_a_Christmas \"Mickey's Twice Upon a\nChristmas\")_.\n\nMany television series have centered on Mickey, such as the ABC shows _[Mickey\nMouse Works](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_Works \"Mickey Mouse Works\")_ (1999–2000),\n_[Disney's House of Mouse](/wiki/Disney%27s_House_of_Mouse \"Disney's House of\nMouse\")_ (2001–2003), [Disney Channel](/wiki/Disney_Channel \"Disney\nChannel\")'s _[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_Clubhouse \"Mickey\nMouse Clubhouse\")_ (2006–2016), and _[Mickey and the Roadster\nRacers](/wiki/Mickey_and_the_Roadster_Racers \"Mickey and the Roadster\nRacers\")_ (2017–). Prior to all these, Mickey was also featured as an [unseen\ncharacter](/wiki/Unseen_character \"Unseen character\") in the\n_[Bonkers](/wiki/Bonkers_\\(TV_series\\) \"Bonkers \\(TV series\\)\")_ episode \"You\nOughta Be In Toons\".\n\nMickey has recently been announced to star in two films. One is being based on\nthe [Magic Kingdom](/wiki/Magic_Kingdom \"Magic Kingdom\") theme park at the\n[Walt Disney World Resort](/wiki/Walt_Disney_World_Resort \"Walt Disney World\nResort\"), while the other is a film idea pitched by [Walt Disney Animation\nStudios](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios \"Walt Disney Animation Studios\")\nveteran [Burny Mattinson](/wiki/Burny_Mattinson \"Burny Mattinson\") centering\non Mickey, Donald, and Goofy.[38]\n\nSince June 28, 2013, [Disney Channel](/wiki/Disney_Channel \"Disney Channel\")\nhas been airing new 3-minute _[Mickey Mouse](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_\\(TV_series\\)\n\"Mickey Mouse \\(TV series\\)\")_ shorts, with animator [Paul\nRudish](/wiki/Paul_Rudish \"Paul Rudish\") at the helm, incorporating elements\nof Mickey's late twenties-early thirties look with a contemporary twist.[39]\nThe creative team behind the [2017 _DuckTales_\nreboot](/wiki/DuckTales_\\(2017_TV_series\\) \"DuckTales \\(2017 TV series\\)\") had\nhoped to have Mickey Mouse in the series, but this idea was rejected by Disney\nexecutives.[40]\n\n## Voice actors\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Walt_disney_portrait.jpg/220px-\nWalt_disney_portrait.jpg)](/wiki/File:Walt_disney_portrait.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Walt_disney_portrait.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWalt Disney (1901–1966), the co-creator of Mickey Mouse and founder of [The\nWalt Disney Company](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company \"The Walt Disney Company\"),\nwas the original voice of Mickey.\n\nA large part of Mickey's screen persona is his famously shy,\n[falsetto](/wiki/Falsetto \"Falsetto\") voice. From 1928 onward, Mickey was\nvoiced by Walt Disney himself, a task in which Disney took great personal\npride. However, by 1946, Disney was becoming too busy with running the studio\nto do regular voice work which meant he could not do Mickey's voice on a\nregular basis anymore. It is also speculated that his [cigarette\nhabit](/wiki/Tobacco_smoking \"Tobacco smoking\") had damaged his voice over the\nyears. After recording the _Mickey and the Beanstalk_ section of _[Fun and\nFancy Free](/wiki/Fun_and_Fancy_Free \"Fun and Fancy Free\")_ , Mickey's voice\nwas handed over to veteran Disney musician and actor [Jimmy\nMacDonald](/wiki/Jimmy_MacDonald_\\(sound_effects_artist\\) \"Jimmy MacDonald\n\\(sound effects artist\\)\"). MacDonald voiced Mickey in the remainder of the\ntheatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until\nhis retirement in 1977, although Walt would reprise Mickey's voice\noccasionally until his passing in 1966, such as in the introductions to the\noriginal 1955–1959 run of _[The Mickey Mouse Club](/wiki/The_Mickey_Mouse_Club\n\"The Mickey Mouse Club\")_ TV series, the \"Fourth Anniversary Show\" episode of\nthe [Disneyland](/wiki/Disneyland \"Disneyland\") TV series that aired on\nSeptember 11, 1958 and the _Disneyland USA at Radio City Music Hall_ show from\n1962.[41]\n\nComposer [Carl W. Stalling](/wiki/Carl_W._Stalling \"Carl W. Stalling\") was the\nvery first person to provide lines for Mickey in the 1929 short _[The Karnival\nKid](/wiki/The_Karnival_Kid \"The Karnival Kid\")_. [Clarence\nNash](/wiki/Clarence_Nash \"Clarence Nash\") voiced Mickey in the 1934 short\n_[The Dognapper](/wiki/The_Dognapper \"The Dognapper\")_ since Walt was\ntraveling in Europe at the time and was unavailable to record his lines for\nMickey for that short. Along with Disney, J. Donald Wilson and Joe Twerp\nprovided the voice in 1938 broadcasts of _[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the\nAir](/wiki/The_Mickey_Mouse_Theater_of_the_Air \"The Mickey Mouse Theater of\nthe Air\")_.[42] [Stan Freberg](/wiki/Stan_Freberg \"Stan Freberg\") voiced\nMickey in the Freberg-produced record _Mickey Mouse 's Birthday Party_. [Alan\nYoung](/wiki/Alan_Young \"Alan Young\") voiced Mickey in the Disneyland record\nalbum _An Adaptation of Dickens ' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt\nDisney Players_ in 1974, which would be the first and only time that Alan\nYoung voiced him.[43][44]\n\nThe 1983 short film _[Mickey's Christmas\nCarol](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Christmas_Carol \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\")_ marked\nthe theatrical debut of [Wayne Allwine](/wiki/Wayne_Allwine \"Wayne Allwine\")\nas Mickey Mouse, who was the official voice of Mickey from 1977 until his\ndeath in 2009.[45] Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him\nabout voicing Mickey: \"The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey\nhelped me keep things in perspective. He said, 'Just remember kid, you're only\nfilling in for the boss.' And that's the way he treated doing Mickey for years\nand years. From Walt, and now from Jimmy.\"[46] In 1991, Allwine married [Russi\nTaylor](/wiki/Russi_Taylor \"Russi Taylor\"), the voice of [Minnie\nMouse](/wiki/Minnie_Mouse \"Minnie Mouse\") since 1986.\n\nLes Perkins did the voice of Mickey in two TV specials, \"Down and Out with\nDonald Duck\" and \"DTV Valentine\", in the mid-1980s. [Peter\nRenaday](/wiki/Peter_Renaday \"Peter Renaday\") voiced Mickey in the 1980s\nDisney albums _Yankee Doodle Mickey_ and _Mickey Mouse Splashdance_.[47][48]\nHe also provided his voice for _[The Talking Mickey\nMouse](/wiki/The_Talking_Mickey_Mouse \"The Talking Mickey Mouse\")_ toy in\n1986.[49][50] [Quinton Flynn](/wiki/Quinton_Flynn \"Quinton Flynn\") briefly\nfilled in for Allwine as the voice of Mickey in a few episodes of the first\nseason of _[Mickey Mouse Works](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_Works \"Mickey Mouse\nWorks\")_ whenever Allwine was unavailable to record.[51]\n\n[Bret Iwan](/wiki/Bret_Iwan \"Bret Iwan\"), a former\n[Hallmark](/wiki/Hallmark_Cards \"Hallmark Cards\") greeting card artist, is the\ncurrent voice of Mickey. Iwan was originally cast as an understudy for Allwine\ndue to the latter’s declining health; however, Allwine died before Iwan could\nmeet him and Iwan became the new official voice of the character. Iwan’s early\nrecordings in 2009 included work for the [Disney Cruise\nLine](/wiki/Disney_Cruise_Line \"Disney Cruise Line\"), Mickey toys, the Disney\ntheme parks and the [Disney on Ice: Celebrations!](/wiki/Disney_on_Ice \"Disney\non Ice\") ice show.[52] He directly replaced Allwine as Mickey for the\n[_Kingdom Hearts_ video game series](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts \"Kingdom Hearts\")\nand the TV series _[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_Clubhouse\n\"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\")_. His first video game voice-over of Mickey Mouse\ncan be heard in _[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by\nSleep](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts:_Birth_by_Sleep \"Kingdom Hearts: Birth by\nSleep\")_. Iwan also became the first voice actor to portray Mickey during\nDisney’s rebranding of the character, providing the vocal effects of Mickey in\n_[Epic Mickey](/wiki/Epic_Mickey \"Epic Mickey\")_ as well as his voice in\n_[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two](/wiki/Epic_Mickey_2:_The_Power_of_Two \"Epic\nMickey 2: The Power of Two\")_ and the remake of _[Castle of\nIllusion](/wiki/Castle_of_Illusion_Starring_Mickey_Mouse_\\(2013_video_game\\)\n\"Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse \\(2013 video game\\)\")_.

Walt\nDisney was approached by [King Features\nSyndicate](/wiki/King_Features_Syndicate \"King Features Syndicate\") with the\noffer to license Mickey and his [supporting\ncharacters](/wiki/Supporting_character \"Supporting character\") for use in a\ncomic strip. Disney accepted and Mickey made his first comic strip appearance\non January 13, 1930. The comical plot was credited to Disney himself, art to\nUb Iwerks and inking to [Win Smith](/wiki/Win_Smith \"Win Smith\"). The first\nweek or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of \"_Plane Crazy_ \".\nMinnie soon became the first addition to the cast. The strips first released\nbetween January 13, 1930, and March 31, 1930, has been occasionally reprinted\nin [comic book](/wiki/Comic_book \"Comic book\") form under the collective title\n_\" Lost on a Desert Island_\". Animation historian Jim Korkis notes \"After the\neighteenth strip, Iwerks left and his inker, Win Smith, continued drawing the\ngag-a-day format...\"[55]\n\nIn early 1930, after Iwerks' departure, Disney was at first content to\ncontinue scripting the Mickey Mouse comic strip, assigning the art to Win\nSmith. However, Disney's focus had always been in animation and Smith was soon\nassigned with the scripting as well. Smith was apparently discontent at the\nprospect of having to script, draw, and ink a series by himself as evidenced\nby his sudden resignation.\n\nDisney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the\nStudio. He selected [Floyd Gottfredson](/wiki/Floyd_Gottfredson \"Floyd\nGottfredson\"), a recently hired employee. At the time Gottfredson was\nreportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new\nassignment. Disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and\nthat he would eventually return to animation. Gottfredson accepted and ended\nup holding this \"temporary\" assignment from May 5, 1930, to November 15, 1975.\n\nWalt Disney's last script for the strip appeared May 17, 1930.[55]\nGottfredson's first task was to finish the storyline Disney had started on\nApril 1, 1930. The storyline was completed on September 20, 1930, and later\nreprinted in comic book form as _Mickey Mouse in Death Valley_. This early\nadventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included\nMickey and Minnie. Among the characters who had their first comic strip\nappearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, and [Black\nPete](/wiki/Pete_\\(Disney\\) \"Pete \\(Disney\\)\") as well as the debuts of\ncorrupted [lawyer](/wiki/Lawyer \"Lawyer\") [Sylvester\nShyster](/wiki/Sylvester_Shyster \"Sylvester Shyster\") and Minnie's uncle\n[Mortimer Mouse](/wiki/Mortimer_Mouse \"Mortimer Mouse\"). The Death Valley\nnarrative was followed by _Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers_ , first printed\nbetween September 22 and December 26, 1930, which introduced [Marcus\nMouse](/wiki/Marcus_Mouse \"Marcus Mouse\") and his wife as Minnie's parents.\n\nStarting with these two early comic strip stories, Mickey's versions in\nanimation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other. While\nDisney and his [cartoon](/wiki/Cartoon \"Cartoon\") shorts would continue to\nfocus on [comedy](/wiki/Comedy \"Comedy\"), the comic strip effectively combined\ncomedy and adventure. This adventurous version of Mickey would continue to\nappear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the 20th and into the\n21st century.\n\nFloyd Gottfredson left his mark with stories such as _Mickey Mouse Joins the\nForeign Legion_ (1936) and _The Gleam_ (1942). He also created the [Phantom\nBlot](/wiki/Phantom_Blot \"Phantom Blot\"), [Eega Beeva](/wiki/Eega_Beeva \"Eega\nBeeva\"), Morty and Ferdie, Captain Churchmouse, and Butch. Besides Gottfredson\nartists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula, Rick Hoover,\n[Manuel Gonzales](/wiki/Manuel_Gonzales \"Manuel Gonzales\"), [Carson Van\nOsten](/wiki/Carson_Van_Osten \"Carson Van Osten\"), Jim Engel, Bill Wright, Ted\nThwailes and [Daan Jippes](/wiki/Daan_Jippes \"Daan Jippes\"); writers included\n[Ted Osborne](/wiki/Ted_Osborne \"Ted Osborne\"), [Merrill De\nMaris](/wiki/Merrill_De_Maris \"Merrill De Maris\"), [Bill\nWalsh](/wiki/Bill_Walsh_\\(producer\\) \"Bill Walsh \\(producer\\)\"), Dick Shaw,\n[Roy Williams](/wiki/Roy_Williams_\\(artist\\) \"Roy Williams \\(artist\\)\"), Del\nConnell, and [Floyd Norman](/wiki/Floyd_Norman \"Floyd Norman\").\n\nThe next artist to leave his mark on the character was [Paul\nMurry](/wiki/Paul_Murry \"Paul Murry\") in [Dell Comics](/wiki/Dell_Comics \"Dell\nComics\"). His first Mickey tale appeared in 1950 but Mickey did not become a\nspecialty until Murry's first serial for _[Walt Disney's Comics and\nStories](/wiki/Walt_Disney%27s_Comics_and_Stories \"Walt Disney's Comics and\nStories\")_ in 1953 (\"The Last Resort\"). In the same period, [Romano\nScarpa](/wiki/Romano_Scarpa \"Romano Scarpa\") in Italy for the magazine\n_Topolino_ began to revitalize Mickey in stories that brought back the\n[Phantom Blot](/wiki/Phantom_Blot \"Phantom Blot\") and [Eega\nBeeva](/wiki/Eega_Beeva \"Eega Beeva\") along with new creations such as the\nAtomo Bleep-Bleep. While the stories at [Western\nPublishing](/wiki/Western_Publishing \"Western Publishing\") during the [Silver\nAge](/wiki/Silver_Age_of_Comic_Books \"Silver Age of Comic Books\") emphasized\nMickey as a detective in the style of [Sherlock Holmes](/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes\n\"Sherlock Holmes\"), in the modern era several editors and creators have\nconsciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous Mickey in the mold of the\nclassic Gottfredson adventures. This renaissance has been spearheaded by\n[Byron Erickson](/wiki/Byron_Erickson \"Byron Erickson\"), [David\nGerstein](/wiki/David_Gerstein \"David Gerstein\"), [Noel Van\nHorn](/wiki/Noel_Van_Horn \"Noel Van Horn\"), [Michael T.\nGilbert](/wiki/Michael_T._Gilbert \"Michael T. Gilbert\") and [César\nFerioli](/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Ferioli \"César Ferioli\").\n\nIn Europe, Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics\nmagazines, the most famous being _[Topolino](/wiki/Topolino \"Topolino\")_ in\nItaly from 1932 on, _[Le Journal de Mickey](/wiki/Le_Journal_de_Mickey \"Le\nJournal de Mickey\")_ in France from 1934 on, _[Don\nMiki](/w/index.php?title=Don_Miki&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Don Miki \\(page does\nnot exist\\)\")_ in Spain and the Greek _[Miky Maous](/wiki/Miky_Maous \"Miky\nMaous\")_.\n\nMickey was the main character for the series _[MM Mickey Mouse Mystery\nMagazine](/wiki/MM_Mickey_Mouse_Mystery_Magazine \"MM Mickey Mouse Mystery\nMagazine\")_ , published in Italy from 1999 to 2001.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in the Italian fantasy comic saga _[Wizards of\nMickey](/wiki/Wizards_of_Mickey \"Wizards of Mickey\")_.\n\nIn 1958, Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic\nbook called “Sameer”. He became very popular in Egypt and got a comic book\nwith his name. Mickey’s comics in Egypt are licensed by Disney and were\npublished since 1959 by “Dar Al-Hilal” and they were success, however Dar Al-\nHilal stopped the publication in 2003 because of problems with Disney. The\ncomics were re-released by \"Nahdat Masr\" in 2004 and the first issues were\nsold out in less than 8 hours.[56]\n\n## Merchandising\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Mickey_Mouse_Ingersoll_watch_1933.jpg/120px-\nMickey_Mouse_Ingersoll_watch_1933.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mickey_Mouse_Ingersoll_watch_1933.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mickey_Mouse_Ingersoll_watch_1933.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA 1933 [Ingersoll](/wiki/Ingersoll_Watch_Company \"Ingersoll Watch Company\")\nMickey Mouse wrist watch.\n\nSince his early years, Mickey Mouse has been licensed by Disney to appear on\nmany different kinds of merchandise. Mickey was produced as plush toys and\nfigurines, and Mickey's image has graced almost everything from T-shirts to\nlunchboxes. Largely responsible for Disney merchandising in the 1930s was [Kay\nKamen](/wiki/Kay_Kamen \"Kay Kamen\") (1892–1949) who was called a \"stickler for\nquality.\" Kamen was recognized by The Walt Disney Company as having a\nsignificant part in Mickey's rise to stardom and was named a [Disney\nLegend](/wiki/Disney_Legend \"Disney Legend\") in 1998.[57] At the time of his\n80th-anniversary celebration in 2008, _[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ declared Mickey Mouse one of the world's most recognized\ncharacters, even when compared against [Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus \"Santa\nClaus\").[58] Disney officials have stated that 98% of children aged 3–11\naround the world are at least aware of the character.[58]\n\nMickey was most famously featured on wrist watches and alarm clocks, typically\nutilizing his hands as the actual hands on the face of the clock. The first\nMickey Mouse watches were manufactured in 1933 by the [Ingersoll Watch\nCompany](/wiki/Ingersoll_Watch_Company \"Ingersoll Watch Company\"). The seconds\nwere indicated by a turning disk below Mickey. The first Mickey watch was sold\nat the [Century of Progress](/wiki/Century_of_Progress \"Century of Progress\")\nin Chicago, 1933 for $3.75. Mickey Mouse watches have been sold by other\ncompanies and designers throughout the years, including\n[Timex](/wiki/Timex_Group_USA \"Timex Group USA\"), Elgin, Helbros, Bradley,\nLorus, and [Gérald Genta](/wiki/G%C3%A9rald_Genta \"Gérald Genta\")[59] The\nfictional character [Robert Langdon](/wiki/Robert_Langdon \"Robert Langdon\")\nfrom Dan Brown's novels was said to wear a Mickey Mouse watch as a reminder\n\"to stay young at heart.\"[60]\n\nIn 1989, [Milton Bradley](/wiki/Milton_Bradley \"Milton Bradley\") released the\nelectronic talking game titled _Mickey Says_ , with three modes featuring\nMickey Mouse as its host. Mickey also appeared in other toys and games,\nincluding the [Worlds of Wonder](/wiki/Worlds_of_Wonder_\\(toy_company\\)\n\"Worlds of Wonder \\(toy company\\)\") released _[The Talking Mickey\nMouse](/wiki/The_Talking_Mickey_Mouse \"The Talking Mickey Mouse\")_.\n\n[Fisher-Price](/wiki/Fisher-Price \"Fisher-Price\") has recently produced a line\nof talking animatronic Mickey dolls including \"Dance Star Mickey\" (2010)[61]\nand \"Rock Star Mickey\" (2011).[62]\n\nIn total, approximately 40% of Disney's revenues for consumer products are\nderived from Mickey Mouse merchandise, with revenues peaking in 1997.[58]\n\n## Mickey at the Disney parks\n\n[![HKMickeyMinnieMainStreetSummer07.JPG](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/81/HKMickeyMinnieMainStreetSummer07.JPG/200px-\nHKMickeyMinnieMainStreetSummer07.JPG)](/wiki/File:HKMickeyMinnieMainStreetSummer07.JPG)[![Disneyland\npark - Anaheim Los Angeles California USA\n\\(9894366226\\).jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Disneyland_park_-\n_Anaheim_Los_Angeles_California_USA_%289894366226%29.jpg/200px-\nDisneyland_park_-\n_Anaheim_Los_Angeles_California_USA_%289894366226%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Disneyland_park_-\n_Anaheim_Los_Angeles_California_USA_\\(9894366226\\).jpg)\n\nMinnie and Mickey at [Hong Kong Disneyland](/wiki/Hong_Kong_Disneyland \"Hong\nKong Disneyland\") (left) and Mickey's house at [Mickey's\nToontown](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Toontown \"Mickey's Toontown\") (right)\n\nAs the official Walt Disney mascot, Mickey has played a central role in the\n[Disney parks](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Parks_and_Resorts \"Walt Disney Parks and\nResorts\") since the opening of [Disneyland](/wiki/Disneyland \"Disneyland\") in\n1955. As with other characters, Mickey is often portrayed by a non-speaking\ncostumed actor. In this form, he has participated in ceremonies and countless\nparades. A popular activity with guests is getting to meet and pose for\nphotographs with the mouse. As of the presidency of [Barack\nObama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\") (who jokingly referred to him as \"a\nworld leader who has bigger ears than me\")[63] Mickey has met every U.S.\nPresident since [Harry Truman](/wiki/Harry_Truman \"Harry Truman\"), with the\nexception of [Lyndon B. Johnson](/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson \"Lyndon B.\nJohnson\").[14]\n\nMickey also features in several specific attractions at the Disney parks.\n[Mickey's Toontown](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Toontown \"Mickey's Toontown\") (Disneyland\nand [Tokyo Disneyland](/wiki/Tokyo_Disneyland \"Tokyo Disneyland\")) is a themed\nland which is a recreation of Mickey's neighborhood.

This is a common place to meet\nthe characters.[64]\n\n[Mickey's PhilharMagic](/wiki/Mickey%27s_PhilharMagic \"Mickey's PhilharMagic\")\n(Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, [Hong Kong\nDisneyland](/wiki/Hong_Kong_Disneyland \"Hong Kong Disneyland\")) is a [4D\nfilm](/wiki/4D_film \"4D film\") which features Mickey in the familiar role of\nsymphony conductor. At [Main Street Cinema](/wiki/Main_Street_Cinema \"Main\nStreet Cinema\") several of Mickey's short films are shown on a rotating basis;\nthe sixth film is always _[Steamboat Willie](/wiki/Steamboat_Willie \"Steamboat\nWillie\")_. Mickey plays a central role in _[Fantasmic!](/wiki/Fantasmic!\n\"Fantasmic!\")_ ([Disneyland Resort](/wiki/Disneyland_Resort \"Disneyland\nResort\"), [Disney's Hollywood Studios](/wiki/Disney%27s_Hollywood_Studios\n\"Disney's Hollywood Studios\")) a live nighttime show which famously features\nMickey in his role as the [Sorcerer's Apprentice](/wiki/Fantasia_\\(1940_film\\)\n\"Fantasia \\(1940 film\\)\"). Mickey was also a central character in the now-\ndefunct [Mickey Mouse Revue](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_Revue \"Mickey Mouse Revue\")\n(Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland) which was an indoor show featuring\nanimatronic characters. Mickey's face currently graces the [Mickey's Fun\nWheel](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Fun_Wheel \"Mickey's Fun Wheel\") at [Disney California\nAdventure Park](/wiki/Disney_California_Adventure_Park \"Disney California\nAdventure Park\"), where a figure of him also stands on top of [Silly Symphony\nSwings](/wiki/Silly_Symphony_Swings \"Silly Symphony Swings\").\n\nIn addition to Mickey's overt presence in the parks, numerous images of him\nare also subtly included in sometimes unexpected places. This phenomenon is\nknown as \"[Hidden Mickey](/wiki/Hidden_Mickey \"Hidden Mickey\")\", involving\nhidden images in Disney films, theme parks, and merchandise.\n\n## Mickey in video games\n\nMain article: [List of Disney video games (Mickey Mouse\nSeries)](/wiki/List_of_Disney_video_games#Mickey_Mouse_Series \"List of Disney\nvideo games\")\n\nLike many popular characters, Mickey has starred in many [video\ngames](/wiki/Video_games \"Video games\"), including _[Mickey\nMousecapade](/wiki/Mickey_Mousecapade \"Mickey Mousecapade\")_ on the [Nintendo\nEntertainment System](/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System \"Nintendo\nEntertainment System\"), _[Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey\nMouse](/wiki/Mickey_Mania:_The_Timeless_Adventures_of_Mickey_Mouse \"Mickey\nMania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse\")_ , _[Mickey's Ultimate\nChallenge](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Ultimate_Challenge \"Mickey's Ultimate\nChallenge\")_, and _[Disney's Magical Quest](/wiki/Disney%27s_Magical_Quest\n\"Disney's Magical Quest\")_ on the [Super Nintendo Entertainment\nSystem](/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System \"Super Nintendo\nEntertainment System\"), _[Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey\nMouse](/wiki/Castle_of_Illusion_Starring_Mickey_Mouse \"Castle of Illusion\nStarring Mickey Mouse\")_ on the [Mega Drive/Genesis](/wiki/Mega_Drive \"Mega\nDrive\"), _[Mickey Mouse: Magic Wands!](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse:_Magic_Wands!\n\"Mickey Mouse: Magic Wands!\")_ on the [Game Boy](/wiki/Game_Boy \"Game Boy\"),\nand many others.

These are _Mickey 's Orphans_ (1931),\n_[Building a Building](/wiki/Building_a_Building \"Building a Building\")_\n(1933), _[Brave Little Tailor](/wiki/Brave_Little_Tailor \"Brave Little\nTailor\")_ (1938), _The Pointer_ (1939), _[Lend a Paw](/wiki/Lend_a_Paw \"Lend a\nPaw\")_ (1941), _[Squatter's Rights](/wiki/Squatter%27s_Rights_\\(film\\)\n\"Squatter's Rights \\(film\\)\")_ (1946), _[Mickey and the\nSeal](/wiki/Mickey_and_the_Seal \"Mickey and the Seal\")_ (1948), _[Mickey's\nChristmas Carol](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Christmas_Carol \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\")_\n(1983), _[Runaway Brain](/wiki/Runaway_Brain \"Runaway Brain\")_ (1995), and\n_[Get a Horse!](/wiki/Get_a_Horse! \"Get a Horse!\")_ (2013). Among these, _Lend\na Paw_ was the only film to actually win the award. Additionally, in 1932 Walt\nDisney received an honorary Academy Award in recognition of Mickey's creation\nand popularity.\n\nIn 1994, four of Mickey's cartoons were included in the book _[The 50 Greatest\nCartoons](/wiki/The_50_Greatest_Cartoons \"The 50 Greatest Cartoons\")_ which\nlisted the greatest cartoons of all time as voted by members of the animation\nfield. The films were _[The Band Concert](/wiki/The_Band_Concert \"The Band\nConcert\")_ (#3), _[Steamboat Willie](/wiki/Steamboat_Willie \"Steamboat\nWillie\")_ (#13), _Brave Little Tailor_ (#26), and _[Clock\nCleaners](/wiki/Clock_Cleaners \"Clock Cleaners\")_ (#27).\n\nOn November 18, 1978, in honor of his 50th anniversary, Mickey became the\nfirst cartoon character to have a star on the [Hollywood Walk of\nFame](/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame \"Hollywood Walk of Fame\"). The star is\nlocated on 6925 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n[Melbourne (Australia)](/wiki/Melbourne \"Melbourne\") runs the annual\n[Moomba](/wiki/Moomba \"Moomba\") festival street procession and appointed\nMickey Mouse as their _King of Moomba_ (1977).[65]:17–22 Although immensely\npopular with children, there was controversy with the appointment: some\nMelburnians wanted a 'home-grown' choice, e.g. [Blinky Bill](/wiki/Blinky_Bill\n\"Blinky Bill\"); when it was revealed that Patricia O'Carroll (from\nDisneyland's Disney on Parade show) was performing the mouse, Australian\nnewspapers reported \"Mickey Mouse is really a girl!\"[65]:19–20\n\nMickey was the [Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses\nParade](/wiki/Grand_Marshal_of_the_Tournament_of_Roses_Parade \"Grand Marshal\nof the Tournament of Roses Parade\") on New Year's Day 2005. He was the first\ncartoon character to receive the honor and only the second fictional character\nafter [Kermit the Frog](/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog \"Kermit the Frog\") in 1996.\n\n## Social impact\n\n### Use in politics\n\nIn the United States, [protest votes](/wiki/Protest_votes \"Protest votes\") are\noften made in order to indicate dissatisfaction with the slate of candidates\npresented on a particular ballot or to highlight the inadequacies of a\nparticular voting procedure. Since most states' electoral systems do not\nprovide for blank balloting or a choice of \"[None of the\nAbove](/wiki/None_of_the_Above \"None of the Above\")\", most protest votes take\nthe form of a clearly non-serious candidate's name entered as a [write-in\nvote](/wiki/Write-in_vote \"Write-in vote\"). Mickey Mouse is often selected for\nthis purpose.[66][67] As an election supervisor in Georgia observed, \"If\n[Mickey Mouse] doesn’t get votes in our election, it’s a bad election.\"[68]\nThe earliest known mention of Mickey Mouse as a write-in candidate dates back\nto the 1932 [New York City mayoral\nelections](/wiki/New_York_City_mayoral_elections \"New York City mayoral\nelections\").[69]\n\nMickey Mouse's name has also been known to appear fraudulently on voter\nregistration lists, such as in the [2008 U.S. Presidential\nElection](/wiki/2008_U.S._Presidential_Election \"2008 U.S. Presidential\nElection\").[70][71]\n\n### Pejorative use of Mickey's name\n\n\"Mickey Mouse\" is a slang expression meaning small-time, amateurish or\ntrivial. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it also means poor quality or\ncounterfeit. However, in parts of Australia it can mean excellent or very good\n(rhyming slang for \"grouse\").[72] Examples of the former two of the three\nusages include the following:\n\n  * In _[The Godfather Part II](/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II \"The Godfather Part II\")_ , [Fredo](/wiki/Fredo_Corleone \"Fredo Corleone\")'s justification of betraying Michael is that his orders in the family usually were \"Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo off to do that! Let Fredo take care of some Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere!\" as opposed to more meaningful tasks.\n  * In an early episode of the 1978–82 [sitcom](/wiki/Sitcom \"Sitcom\") _[Mork& Mindy](/wiki/Mork_%26_Mindy \"Mork & Mindy\")_, Mork stated that [Pluto](/wiki/Pluto \"Pluto\") was \"a Mickey Mouse planet\", referring to the future [dwarf planet](/wiki/Dwarf_planet \"Dwarf planet\") having the same name as Mickey's pet dog [Pluto](/wiki/Pluto_\\(Disney\\) \"Pluto \\(Disney\\)\"). Actually, the planet was named shortly before the dog was.\n  * In 1984, just after an [ice hockey](/wiki/Ice_hockey \"Ice hockey\") game in which [Wayne Gretzky](/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky \"Wayne Gretzky\")'s [Edmonton Oilers](/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers \"Edmonton Oilers\") beat the [New Jersey Devils](/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils \"New Jersey Devils\") 13–4, Gretzky was quoted as saying to a reporter, \"Well, it's time they got their act together, they're ruining the whole league. They had better stop running a _Mickey Mouse organization_ and put somebody on the ice\". Reacting to Gretzky's comment, Devils fans wore Mickey Mouse apparel when the Oilers returned to New Jersey.[73]\n  * In the 1993 Warner Bros. film _[Demolition Man](/wiki/Demolition_Man_\\(film\\) \"Demolition Man \\(film\\)\")_ , as [Sylvester Stallone](/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone \"Sylvester Stallone\")'s character is fighting the malfunctioning [AI](/wiki/AI \"AI\") of his out-of-control police car, he shouts for the system to \"Brake! Brake! Brake now, you _Mickey Mouse piece of shit!_ \"[74]\n  * In the 1996 Warner Bros. film _[Space Jam](/wiki/Space_Jam \"Space Jam\")_ , [Bugs Bunny](/wiki/Bugs_Bunny \"Bugs Bunny\") derogatorily comments on [Daffy Duck](/wiki/Daffy_Duck \"Daffy Duck\")'s idea for the name of their basketball team, asking: \"What kind of Mickey Mouse organization would name a team 'The Ducks?'\" (This also referenced the [Mighty Ducks of Anaheim](/wiki/Anaheim_Ducks \"Anaheim Ducks\"), an [NHL](/wiki/National_Hockey_League \"National Hockey League\") team that was then owned by Disney, as well as the Disney-made [\"The Mighty Ducks\"](/wiki/The_Mighty_Ducks_\\(film_series\\) \"The Mighty Ducks \\(film series\\)\") movie franchise. This was referencing the Disney/Warner Brothers rivalry.)\n  * In the United States armed forces, actions that look good but have little or no practical use (such as the specific manner of making beds in basic training or the polishing of brass fittings on board ship) are commonly referred to as \"Mickey Mouse work.\"[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n  * In schools a \"Mickey Mouse course\", \"Mickey Mouse major\", or \"[Mickey Mouse degree](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_degrees \"Mickey Mouse degrees\")\" is a class, college major, or degree where very little effort is necessary in order to attain a good grade (especially an A) or one where the subject matter of such a class is not of any importance in the labor market.[75]\n  * Musicians often refer to a film score that directly follows each action on screen as _[Mickey Mousing](/wiki/Mickey_Mousing \"Mickey Mousing\")_ (also _mickey-mousing_ and _mickeymousing_).[76]\n  * Software company [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\") has been derogatorily called \"Mickeysoft\".[77]\n  * In the beginning of the 1980s, then-British [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister \"Prime Minister\") [Margaret Thatcher](/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher \"Margaret Thatcher\") once called the [European Parliament](/wiki/European_Parliament \"European Parliament\") a \"Mickey Mouse parliament\", meaning a discussion club without influence.[78]\n  * In the British sitcom _[Red Dwarf](/wiki/Red_Dwarf \"Red Dwarf\")_ , in the episode [\"Quarantine\"](/wiki/Quarantine_\\(Red_Dwarf\\) \"Quarantine \\(Red Dwarf\\)\"), after the team's substandard equipment nearly cost them their lives, Lister pointed out, \"We're a real Mickey Mouse operation, aren't we?\" The Cat replied, \"Mickey Mouse?

For this reason, Mickey has been used frequently in\n[anti-American](/wiki/Anti-American \"Anti-American\") [satire](/wiki/Satire\n\"Satire\"), such as the infamous underground cartoon \"_[Mickey Mouse in\nVietnam](/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_in_Vietnam \"Mickey Mouse in Vietnam\")_ \" (1969).\nThere have been numerous [parodies](/wiki/Parody \"Parody\") of Mickey Mouse,\nsuch as the 2-page parody _\" Mickey Rodent\"_ by [Will Elder](/wiki/Will_Elder\n\"Will Elder\") (published in _[Mad](/wiki/Mad_\\(magazine\\) \"Mad \\(magazine\\)\")_\n#19, 1955) in which the mouse walks around unshaven and jails [Donald\nDuck](/wiki/Donald_Duck \"Donald Duck\") out of jealousy over the duck's larger\npopularity.[80] The grotesque [Rat Fink](/wiki/Rat_Fink \"Rat Fink\") character\nwas created by [Ed \"Big Daddy\" Roth](/wiki/Ed_%22Big_Daddy%22_Roth \"Ed \"Big\nDaddy\" Roth\") over his hatred of Mickey Mouse. In _[The Simpsons\nMovie](/wiki/The_Simpsons_Movie \"The Simpsons Movie\")_ , [Bart\nSimpson](/wiki/Bart_Simpson \"Bart Simpson\") puts a black bra on his head to\nmimic Mickey Mouse and says: \"I'm the mascot of an [evil\ncorporation](/wiki/Evil_corporation \"Evil corporation\")!\"[81] On the [Comedy\nCentral](/wiki/Comedy_Central \"Comedy Central\") series _[South\nPark](/wiki/South_Park \"South Park\")_ , Mickey is depicted as the sadistic,\ngreedy, foul-mouthed boss of [The Walt Disney\nCompany](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company \"The Walt Disney Company\"), only\ninterested in money. He also appears briefly with [Donald\nDuck](/wiki/Donald_Duck \"Donald Duck\") in the comic _[Squeak the\nMouse](/wiki/Squeak_the_Mouse \"Squeak the Mouse\")_ by the Italian cartoonist\n[Massimo Mattioli](/wiki/Massimo_Mattioli \"Massimo Mattioli\").\n\nIn the 1969 parody novel _[Bored of the Rings](/wiki/Bored_of_the_Rings \"Bored\nof the Rings\")_ , Mickey Mouse is satirized as Dickey Dragon.\n\n## Legal issues\n\nLike all major Disney characters, Mickey Mouse is not only\n[copyrighted](/wiki/Copyright \"Copyright\") but also\n[trademarked](/wiki/Trademark \"Trademark\"), which lasts in perpetuity as long\nas it continues to be used commercially by its owner. So, whether or not a\nparticular Disney cartoon goes into the [public domain](/wiki/Public_domain\n\"Public domain\"), the characters themselves may not be used as trademarks\nwithout authorization.\n\nBecause of the [Copyright Term Extension\nAct](/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act \"Copyright Term Extension Act\") of the\nUnited States (sometimes called the 'Mickey Mouse Protection Act' because of\nextensive lobbying by the Disney corporation) and similar legislation within\nthe [European Union](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\") and other\njurisdictions where [copyright terms](/wiki/Copyright_term \"Copyright term\")\nhave been extended, works such as the early Mickey Mouse cartoons will remain\nunder copyright until at least 2023. However, some copyright scholars argue\nthat Disney's copyright on the earliest version of the character may be\ninvalid due to ambiguity in the copyright notice for _[Steamboat\nWillie](/wiki/Steamboat_Willie \"Steamboat Willie\")_.[82]\n\nThe Walt Disney Company has become well known for protecting its trademark on\nthe Mickey Mouse character—whose likeness is closely associated with the\ncompany—with particular zeal. In 1989, Disney threatened legal action against\nthree daycare centers in [Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\") for having Mickey\nMouse and other Disney characters painted on their walls. The characters were\nremoved, and rival [Universal Studios](/wiki/Universal_Studios \"Universal\nStudios\") replaced them with Universal cartoon characters.[83]\n\n### _Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates_\n\nIn 1971, a group of [underground cartoonists](/wiki/Underground_comix\n\"Underground comix\") calling themselves the [Air Pirates](/wiki/Air_Pirates\n\"Air Pirates\"), after a group of villains from early Mickey Mouse films,\nproduced a comic called _Air Pirates Funnies_. In the first issue, cartoonist\n[Dan O'Neill](/wiki/Dan_O%27Neill \"Dan O'Neill\") depicted Mickey and Minnie\nMouse engaging in explicit sexual behavior and consuming drugs. As O'Neill\nexplained, \"The air pirates were…some sort of bizarre concept to steal the\nair, pirate the air, steal the media….Since we were cartoonists, the logical\nthing was Disney.\"[84] Rather than change the appearance or name of the\ncharacter, which O'Neill felt would dilute the parody, the mouse depicted in\n_Air Pirates Funnies_ looks like and is named \"Mickey Mouse\". Disney sued for\ncopyright infringement, and after a series of appeals, O'Neill eventually lost\nand was ordered to pay Disney $1.9 million. The outcome of the case remains\ncontroversial among free-speech advocates. New York Law School professor\nEdward Samuels said, \"[The Air Pirates] set parody back twenty\nyears.\"[85][_[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS \"Wikipedia:NOTRS\")_]\n\n### Censorship\n\nIn 1930, The [German](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\") Board of Film Censors\nprohibited any presentations of the Mickey Mouse cartoon _[The Barnyard\nBattle](/wiki/The_Barnyard_Battle \"The Barnyard Battle\")_ (1929). The animated\nshort, which features the mouse as a [kepi](/wiki/Kepi \"Kepi\")-wearing soldier\nfighting cat enemies in German-style helmets, was viewed by censors as a\nnegative portrayal of Germany.[86] It was claimed by the board that the film\nwould \"reawaken the latest anti-German feeling existing abroad since the\nWar\".[87] The _Barnyard Battle_ incident did not incite wider anti-Mickey\nsentiment in Germany in 1930; however, after [Adolf Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler\n\"Adolf Hitler\") came to power several years later, the Nazi regime\nunambiguously propagandized against Disney. A mid-1930s German newspaper\narticle read:\n\n> \"Mickey Mouse is the most miserable ideal ever revealed...Healthy emotions\n> tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty\n> and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal\n> kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal...Away with Jewish brutalization\n> of the people! Down with Mickey Mouse! Wear the [Swastika\n> Cross](/wiki/Nazi_swastika \"Nazi swastika\")!\"[88][89][90]\n\nAmerican cartoonist and writer [Art Spiegelman](/wiki/Art_Spiegelman \"Art\nSpiegelman\") would later use this quote on the opening page of the second\nvolume of his graphic novel _[Maus](/wiki/Maus \"Maus\")_.\n\nIn 1935 Romanian authorities also [banned](/wiki/Ban_\\(legal\\) \"Ban\n\\(legal\\)\") Mickey Mouse films from [cinemas](/wiki/Movie_theater \"Movie\ntheater\"), purportedly fearing that children would be \"scared to see a ten-\nfoot mouse in the movie theatre\".[91] In 1938, based on the [Ministry of\nPopular Culture](/wiki/Ministry_of_Popular_Culture \"Ministry of Popular\nCulture\")'s recommendation that a reform was necessary \"to raise children in\nthe firm and imperialist spirit of the Fascist revolution,\" the [Italian\nGovernment](/wiki/Italian_Government \"Italian Government\") banned foreign\n[children's literature](/wiki/Children%27s_literature \"Children's\nliterature\")[92] except Mickey; Disney characters were exempted from the\ndecree for the \"acknowledged artistic merit\" of Disney's work.[93] Actually,\nMussolini's children were fond of Mickey Mouse, so they managed to delay his\nban as long as possible.[94] In 1942, after Italy declared war on the United\nStates, fascism immediately forced Italian publishers to stop printing any\nDisney stories. Mickey's stories were replaced by the adventures of\n_Tuffolino_ , a new human character created by Federico Pedrocchi (script) and\nPier Lorenzo De Vita (art). After the downfall of Italy's fascist government\nin 1945, the ban was removed.\n\n## Filmography\n\nMain article: [List of Mickey Mouse films and\nappearances](/wiki/List_of_Mickey_Mouse_films_and_appearances \"List of Mickey\nMouse films and appearances\")\n\nMickey has been announced to star in two films.
