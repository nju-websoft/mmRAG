Commanded by Governor Tarkin, it is the\n[Galactic Empire](/wiki/Galactic_Empire_\\(Star_Wars\\) \"Galactic Empire \\(Star\nWars\\)\")'s \"ultimate weapon\",[12] a huge spherical space station over 100\nkilometers in diameter capable of destroying a planet with one shot of its\nsuperlaser.

Tarkin orders the Death Star to destroy Leia's home\nworld of [Alderaan](/wiki/Alderaan \"Alderaan\") in an attempt to press her into\ngiving him the location of the secret Rebel base; she gives them the false\nlocation of [Dantooine](/wiki/Dantooine \"Dantooine\"), but Tarkin has Alderaan\ndestroyed anyway, as a demonstration of the Death Star's firepower and the\nEmpire's resolve.

As they make their escape, Obi-Wan dies fighting Darth\nVader, enabling the others to flee the station. Later, Luke returns as part of\na fighter force to attack its only weak point: a ray-shielded particle exhaust\nvent leading straight from the surface directly into its reactor core. Luke\nwas able to successfully launch his fighter's torpedoes into the vent,\nimpacting the core and triggering a catastrophic explosion, which completely\ndestroyed the station before it could use its superlaser weapon to annihilate\nits intended target, the rebel base on Yavin IV.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n_[The Clone Wars](/wiki/The_Clone_Wars \"The Clone Wars\")_ Legacy story reel\nfrom the unfinished _Crystal Crisis on Utapau_ episodes revealed that the\nreason [General Grievous](/wiki/General_Grievous \"General Grievous\") was on\nUtapau in _Revenge of the Sith_ was to acquire enormous [kyber\ncrystals](/wiki/Kyber_crystal \"Kyber crystal\"), which were required to power\nthe Death Star's superlaser.[13]\n\nThe first Death Star's schematics are visible in the scenes on Geonosis in\n_[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the\nClones](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_II_%E2%80%93_Attack_of_the_Clones \"Star Wars:\nEpisode II – Attack of the Clones\")_ showcasing the early development of the\nDeath Star prototype, the Death Star plans were designed by\n[Geonosians](/wiki/Geonosian \"Geonosian\") led by Archduke [Poggle the\nLesser](/wiki/Poggle_the_Lesser \"Poggle the Lesser\"), a member of the\n[Confederacy of Independent Systems](/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems\n\"Confederacy of Independent Systems\"), and is shown early in construction at\nthe end of _[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the\nSith](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_III_%E2%80%93_Revenge_of_the_Sith \"Star Wars:\nEpisode III – Revenge of the Sith\")_.

[Saw Gerrera](/wiki/Saw_Gerrera \"Saw Gerrera\"), having been sent to\nGeonosis to investigate, deduced the Empire possesses a superweapon and\nresolved to discover the Death Star as depicted in the final season two-parter\n\"In the Name of the Rebellion.\" Though it was a dead end, finding only\nscientists being abducted by the Empire, Saw learned the weapon is powered by\nkyber crystals taken from the Jedha system.\n\nThe [anthology film](/wiki/Star_Wars#Anthology_series \"Star Wars\") _[Rogue\nOne](/wiki/Rogue_One \"Rogue One\")_ focuses on a band of Rebels stealing the\nplans for the first Death Star prior to the events of _A New Hope_. The Death\nStar project was overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons\nResearch for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project\nwas beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen\nErso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the\ndesign; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the Death Star was\noperational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals\nmined from the desert moon of [Jedha](/wiki/Jedha \"Jedha\"), and is first used\nto destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the\nplanet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the\nEmpire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the\nDeath Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project.\nIt is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by\nbuilding a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that\nLuke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of _A New Hope_. After the\nDeath Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star\nlaser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian\nAndor.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nThe canonical population of the first Death Star was 1.7 million military\npersonnel, 400,000 maintenance droids, and 250,000 civilians/independent\ncontractors.[1][2]\n\nThe 2014 book _[Star Wars: Tarkin](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Tarkin \"Star Wars:\nTarkin\")_ detailed the life of [Grand Moff Tarkin](/wiki/Grand_Moff_Tarkin\n\"Grand Moff Tarkin\"), and prominently featured the first Death Star. The theme\nof the construction of the Death Star is continued in the 2016 book,\n_[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel](/wiki/Catalyst:_A_Rogue_One_Novel \"Catalyst: A\nRogue One Novel\")_ , which tells the story of the development of the Death\nStar's superweapon by the scientist, [Galen Erso](/wiki/Galen_Erso \"Galen\nErso\") and Krennic's deception of him. It also reveals how Poggle worked with\nKrennic on the Project but then turned on him.[14]\n\nIn the film _[Rogue One](/wiki/Rogue_One \"Rogue One\"),_ it is revealed that\nthe Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to\nvary its destructive power depending on the target. Skeptical of the station's\npower, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single\nreactor. Subsequently, a second single-reactor test would destroy their\ninstallation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully\nstolen the station's plans. The destruction of the planet\n[Alderaan](/wiki/Alderaan \"Alderaan\") would be the first time the Death Star\nwas tested with all reactors employed.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n#### _DS-2_ Platform - (Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the\nJedi)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Death_Star&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: DS-2 Platform - \\(Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi\\)\")]\n\n_[Return of the Jedi](/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi \"Return of the Jedi\")_ features\na second Death Star still under construction in orbit around the second moon\nof [Endor](/wiki/Endor_\\(Star_Wars\\) \"Endor \\(Star Wars\\)\"). [Emperor\nPalpatine](/wiki/Palpatine \"Palpatine\") and [Darth Vader](/wiki/Darth_Vader\n\"Darth Vader\") send the Rebels false information that the station's weapons\nsystems are not operational in order to lure them into a trap. When the\nstation's protective shield is disabled by a ground assault team on the forest\nmoon of the planet Endor (led by Han Solo) with the help of the native\n[Ewoks](/wiki/Ewoks \"Ewoks\"), rebel fighters flew into the unfinished station\ntargeting its reactor core chamber and damaged the reactor core itself, which\neventually explodes and destroys the station. It was destroyed by [Wedge\nAntilles](/wiki/Wedge_Antilles \"Wedge Antilles\") and [Lando\nCalrissian](/wiki/Lando_Calrissian \"Lando Calrissian\") (with [Nien\nNunb](/wiki/Nien_Nunb \"Nien Nunb\") as his _[Millennium\nFalcon](/wiki/Millennium_Falcon \"Millennium Falcon\")_ co-pilot), the former\ndestroying a power regulator and the latter destroying the main\nreactor.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe Death Star II is featured in the cover of the book _[Star Wars:\nAftermath](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Aftermath \"Star Wars: Aftermath\")_ (2015), which\nalso features many flashbacks to the destruction of the Death Star II, as well\nas the events directly after its destruction. One of the main characters in\nthe story personally escaped the explosion of the Death Star. The destruction\nof the second Death Star was also shown in holograms in the book. The 2015\ncomic book _[Star Wars: Shattered Empire](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Shattered_Empire\n\"Star Wars: Shattered Empire\")_ also explores the days following the\ndestruction of the Death Star II from the perspective of [Poe\nDameron](/wiki/Poe_Dameron \"Poe Dameron\")'s parents, who were pilots during\nthe event. The video game _[Star Wars: Uprising](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Uprising\n\"Star Wars: Uprising\")_ also takes place during the aftermath of the second\nDeath Star's destruction, and features a hologram of its description on\nmultiple occasions in and out of cutscenes.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Similar super weapons of mass\ndestruction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Death_Star&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Similar super weapons of mass destruction\")]\n\n#### Malachor Sith Temple - (_Star Wars\nRebels_)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Death_Star&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Malachor Sith Temple - \\(Star Wars Rebels\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Star Wars Rebels](/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels \"Star Wars Rebels\")\n\nThe _[Star Wars Rebels](/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels \"Star Wars Rebels\")_ episode\n_Twilight of the Apprentice_ features a forbidden planet called Malachor,[15]\nhome of an ancient [Sith](/wiki/Sith \"Sith\") Temple.[16] This temple contained\na Battle Station capable of destroying planets, and could only be activated by\nplacing a special Sith Holocron[17] in an [obelisk](/wiki/Obelisk \"Obelisk\")\nat the summit of the pyramid inside the temple. Thousands of years prior, a\nbattle was waged on Malachor that resulted in the deaths of its inhabitants.\nSomewhere between the events of his last appearance in [The Clone\nWars](/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_\\(2008_TV_series\\) \"Star Wars: The Clone\nWars \\(2008 TV series\\)\") and this episode, [Darth Maul](/wiki/Darth_Maul\n\"Darth Maul\") had become stranded on Malachor. When [Ahsoka\nTano](/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano \"Ahsoka Tano\"), Kanan and Ezra arrived, Ezra was\nseparated from them. He was discovered by a character who later revealed\nhimself to be Maul. Together, they solved a series of test chambers that\nrequired cooperation between two Force wielders, and retrieved a Sith\nHolocron. With the help of Kanan and Ahsoka, they fought three Inquisitors,\nall of whom were killed by Maul. Maul then betrayed his allies, blinding\nKanan, and proceeded to activate the Battle Station. Once Maul was defeated by\na sightless Kanan, Darth Vader arrived with the intention of retrieving the\nholocron, but was challenged by Ahsoka Tano, his former Padawan. While the\nstation was preparing to fire, Kanan and Ezra retrieved the holocron\nthemselves and escaped, preventing this weapon of mass destruction from being\nused. Even though the temple was destabilized, Ahsoka and Vader kept fighting\nto the death within the rapidly-crumbling building, until it eventually\nexploded, wounding Darth Vader and almost killing Ahsoka.[18]\n\n#### Starkiller Base - (_Star Wars: The Force\nAwakens_)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Death_Star&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Starkiller Base - \\(Star Wars: The Force Awakens\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Star Wars: The Force\nAwakens](/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\")\n\n_[Star Wars: The Force Awakens](/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens \"Star Wars:\nThe Force Awakens\")_ features [Starkiller Base](/wiki/Starkiller_Base\n\"Starkiller Base\"), a planet turned into a battle station built by the [First\nOrder](/wiki/First_Order_\\(Star_Wars\\) \"First Order \\(Star Wars\\)\").\nSignificantly larger than either the first or second Death Star, and unlike\neither of those cost-prohibitive space stations, this battle station cut-costs\nby [terraforming](/wiki/Terraforming \"Terraforming\") an existing planet and\ndraws its fire power directly from a sun, but it requires time to draw enough\nenergy. Once fired, it has the power to destroy up to five planets within the\nsame [star system](/wiki/Star_system \"Star system\") simultaneously, making it\na far deadlier superweapon than the Death Star.

Anderson\")'s novel\n_[Darksaber](/wiki/Darksaber_\\(novel\\) \"Darksaber \\(novel\\)\")_ (1995), and a\nprototype version of the Death Star can be found in his novel _[Jedi\nSearch](/wiki/Jedi_Search \"Jedi Search\")_ (1994).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe first Death Star is depicted in various sources of having a crew of\n265,675, as well as 52,276 gunners, 607,360 troops, 30,984 stormtroopers,\n42,782 ship support staff, and 180,216 pilots and support crew.[21] Its\nhangars contain assault shuttles, blastboats, Strike cruisers, land vehicles,\nsupport ships, and 7,293 [TIE fighters](/wiki/TIE_fighter \"TIE fighter\").[22]\nIt is also protected by 10,000 turbolaser batteries, 2,600 [ion\ncannons](/wiki/Ion_cannon \"Ion cannon\"), and at least 768 [tractor\nbeam](/wiki/Tractor_beam \"Tractor beam\") projectors.[22] Various sources state\nthe first Death Star has a [diameter](/wiki/Diameter \"Diameter\") of between\n140 and 160 kilometers.[21][23][24] There is a broader range of figures for\nthe second Death Star's diameter, ranging from 160 to 900 kilometers.[25][26]\n\n#### _DS-X_ Prototype Battle\nStation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Death_Star&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: DS-X Prototype Battle Station\")]\n\nIn the _Legends_ novels _Death Star_ , _Dark Empire II_ , _Jedi Search_ and\n_Champions of the Force_ , an experimental _Death Star_ prototype, _**DS-X**_\n(a durasteel frame surrounding a reactor core, superlaser, engines and a\ncontrol room) was conceived by [Grand Moff Wilhuff\nTarkin](/wiki/Grand_Moff_Tarkin \"Grand Moff Tarkin\") as a test bed for the\nfirst Death Star. It was constructed by Bevel Lemelisk and his engineers at\nthe Empire's secret Maw Installation. The prototype measured 120 kilometers in\ndiameter. Its superlaser was only powerful enough to destroy a planet's core,\nrendering it an uninhabitable \"dead planet\". The targeting system on the\nprototype was never calibrated and the superlaser was inefficient, leaving the\nweapon's batteries drained. The prototype had no interior except a slave-\nlinked control room, hyperdrive engines and other components; the station\noperated with skeleton-crew of 75 personnel.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nGeorge Lucas himself confirmed that the plans featured in _Attack of the\nClones_ and the under-construction facility in _Revenge of the Sith_ was\nindeed the original _Death Star_.

In the original Star Tours, a\n_**Death Star III**_ is seen and destroyed during the ride sequence by the New\nRepublic. [Leland Chee](/wiki/Leland_Chee \"Leland Chee\") originally created\nthe third _Death Star_ to explain why a _Death Star_ is present on the _[Star\nTours](/wiki/Star_Tours \"Star Tours\")_ ride when both of the stations in the\nmovies were destroyed.[27] The station being built near the Forest Moon of\nEndor like the second _Death Star_ before it is similar to an original concept\nfor Return of the Jedi, where two _Death Star_ s would have been built near\nHad Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). The _Habitation_ spheres, based\non the Imperials' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for\npeaceful purposes, were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the\nDeath Star III. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the\nStarWars.com Blog series _The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire_. In\nthe _[Star Wars Legends](/wiki/Star_Wars_Legends \"Star Wars Legends\")_ game\n_[Tiny Death Star](/wiki/Tiny_Death_Star \"Tiny Death Star\")_ , a random\nHoloNet entry states that one of the residents of the _Death Star_ is simply\nstaying there until he can afford to stay at the third _Death\nStar_.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n## Cultural\ninfluence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Death_Star&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Cultural influence\")]\n\nThe Death Star placed ninth in a 2008 [20th Century\nFox](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox \"20th Century Fox\") poll of the most popular movie\nweapons.[28] It is also referred to outside of the _Star Wars_\ncontext.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[KTCK](/wiki/KTCK_\\(AM\\) \"KTCK \\(AM\\)\") (SportsRadio 1310 The Ticket) in\nDallas were the first to use the term \"Death Star\" to describe the new mammoth\nCowboys Stadium, now [AT&T Stadium](/wiki/AT%26T_Stadium \"AT&T Stadium\"), in\n[Arlington, Texas](/wiki/Arlington,_Texas \"Arlington, Texas\").
