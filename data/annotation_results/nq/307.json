        "# Foreign official\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**Foreign official** or **foreign public official** refers to a person who\nacts in an official capacity for a foreign government. The term is chiefly\nused in connection with international conventions and national laws against\ncorruption in international trade.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 International law\n  * 2 National jurisdictions\n    * 2.1 US Department of Justice definition\n  * 3 Risks of business with foreign officials\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## International\nlaw[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Foreign_official&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: International law\")]\n\nMembers of the _Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development_\n([OECD](/wiki/OECD \"OECD\")) agreed the [OECD Anti-Bribery\nConvention](/wiki/OECD_Anti-Bribery_Convention \"OECD Anti-Bribery Convention\")\nin 1999 and this treaty has been ratified by 39 countries.[1] The document[2]\ndefines a foreign public official as follows:\n\n> _\" Foreign public official\" means any person holding a legislative,\n> administrative or judicial office of a foreign country, whether appointed or\n> elected; any person exercising a public function for a foreign country,\n> including for a public agency or public enterprise; and any official or\n> agent of a public international organisation_\n\nAnd expands the definition as such:\n\n> _\" Public function\" includes any activity in the public interest, delegated\n> by a foreign country, such as the performance of a task delegated by it in\n> connection with public procurement._\n\n> _A \"public agency\" is an entity constituted under public law to carry out\n> specific tasks in the public interest._\n\n> _A \"public enterprise\" is any enterprise, regardless of its legal form, over\n> which a government, or governments, may, directly or indirectly, exercise a\n> dominant influence. This is deemed to be the case, inter alia, when the\n> government or governments hold the majority of the enterprise's subscribed\n> capital, control the majority of votes attaching to shares issued by the\n> enterprise or can appoint a majority of the members of the enterprise's\n> administrative or managerial body or supervisory board._\n\nThe definition of a foreign official defined in the OECD agreement is now\nreferenced in enforcement actions by the United States Department of\nJustice.[3]\n\n## National\njurisdictions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Foreign_official&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: National jurisdictions\")]\n\n### US Department of Justice\ndefinition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Foreign_official&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: US Department of Justice definition\")]\n\nAccording to the [US Department of Justice](/wiki/US_Department_of_Justice \"US\nDepartment of Justice\"), the term \"foreign official\" is defined as:\n\n> _any officer or employee of a foreign government or any department, agency,\n> or instrumentality thereof, or of a public international organization, or\n> any person acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any such\n> government or department, agency, or instrumentality, or for or on behalf of\n> any such public international organization._\n>\n> — [4]\n\nThe intent of the law is to stop the [bribing](/wiki/Bribing \"Bribing\") of\nforeign officials so that the actual providing of funds to foreign governments\ndirectly would not constitute a violation.\n\nThe FCPA applies to US companies and foreign organisations or persons doing\nbusiness within the borders of the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United\nStates\"). This definition also applies to issuers of publicly traded\nsecurities (companies traded on US stock exchanges and in other US markets).\n\n## Risks of business with foreign\nofficials[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Foreign_official&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Risks of business with foreign officials\")]\n\nThe process of recognising if an entity is doing business with an individual\nwho would be considered a foreign official is not only necessary from a\ncompliance perspective, but also necessary when evaluating the risks in a\ncompany's business model. This process can be very simple or may be quite\ncomplex depending on how many relationships an entity has in place. The\nprocess of identifying foreign officials is typically carried out by the\ncomparisons of client or third-party lists with lists of foreign officials\nthat contain the names and positions of such officials, as well as unique\nidentifiers such as dates of birth, photos, and contact numbers.\n\nThe term foreign official should not be confused with the term \"[politically\nexposed person](/wiki/Politically_exposed_person \"Politically exposed\nperson\")\", as this term relates to the financial sector and its clients. The\nterm \"foreign official\" relates to all industries.[5][_[not in citation\ngiven](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Foreign_official&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Bribery Act 2010](/wiki/Bribery_Act_2010 \"Bribery Act 2010\") (United Kingdom)\n  * [Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act](/wiki/Corruption_of_Foreign_Public_Officials_Act \"Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act\") (Canada)\n  * [OECD Anti-Bribery Convention](/wiki/OECD_Anti-Bribery_Convention \"OECD Anti-Bribery Convention\")\n  * [Politically Exposed Person](/wiki/Politically_Exposed_Person \"Politically Exposed Person\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Foreign_official&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Russia - OECD Anti-Bribery Convention](http://www.oecd.org/daf/briberyininternationalbusiness/anti-briberyconvention/russia-oecdanti-briberyconvention.htm), OECD\n  2. **Jump up ^** [CONVENTION ON COMBATING BRIBERY OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS and Related Documents](http://www.oecd.org/daf/briberyininternationalbusiness/anti-briberyconvention/38028044.pdf), OECD\n  3. **Jump up ^** [\"'Majority' Report - The FCPA Blog - The FCPA Blog\"](http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2011/3/15/majority-report.html).\n  4. **Jump up ^** <http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/opinion/1997/9702.html>\n  5. **Jump up ^** <http://www.worldcompliance.com/global-pep-list.html>\n\n![](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1)\n\nRetrieved from\n\"[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreign_official&oldid=749332099](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreign_official&oldid=749332099)\"\n\n[Categories](/wiki/Help:Category \"Help:Category\"):\n\n  * [United States foreign relations legislation](/wiki/Category:United_States_foreign_relations_legislation \"Category:United States foreign relations legislation\")\n  * [Corruption in the United States](/wiki/Category:Corruption_in_the_United_States \"Category:Corruption in the United States\")\n  * [Regulatory compliance](/wiki/Category:Regulatory_compliance \"Category:Regulatory compliance\")\n\nHidden categories:\n\n  * [All articles with failed verification](/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_failed_verification \"Category:All articles with failed verification\")\n  * [Articles with failed verification from November 2011](/wiki/Category:Articles_with_failed_verification_from_November_2011 \"Category:Articles with failed verification from November 2011\")\n\n## Navigation menu\n\n### Personal tools\n\n  * Not logged in\n  * [Talk](/wiki/Special:MyTalk \"Discussion about edits from this IP address \\[ctrl-alt-n\\]\")\n  * [Contributions](/wiki/Special:MyContributions \"A list of edits made from this IP address \\[ctrl-alt-y\\]\")\n  * [Create account](/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Foreign+official \"You are encouraged to create an account and log in;
