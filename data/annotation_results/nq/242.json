The\nrivers that created the marsh eventually went underground, and the marsh\nreceded. The valley then evolved into a parched, arid landscape that only\nsupported the hardiest animals and plants.\n\nAt some point in the valley's early [geologic history](/wiki/Geology\n\"Geology\"), the water resurfaced and flowed into what is now the Colorado\nRiver. This created a luxurious plant life, forming a [wetland](/wiki/Wetlands\n\"Wetlands\") [oasis](/wiki/Oasis \"Oasis\") in the [Mojave Desert\nlandscape](/wiki/Mojave_Desert \"Mojave Desert\").\n\nEvidence of prehistoric life in Las Vegas Valley was found in 1993, when a\ngroup of construction workers discovered the remains of a [Columbian\nmammoth](/wiki/Columbian_mammoth \"Columbian mammoth\").\n[Palaeontologists](/wiki/Palaeontologists \"Palaeontologists\") estimate that\nthe mammoth roamed the area some 8,000 to 15,000 years ago.\n\n[Native Americans](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native\nAmericans in the United States\") lived in the Las Vegas Valley, beginning over\n10,000 years ago. Archaeologists have discovered baskets,\n[petroglyphs](/wiki/Petroglyph \"Petroglyph\"), [pictographs](/wiki/Pictograph\n\"Pictograph\") and other evidence in diverse locations, including [Gypsum\nCave](/wiki/Gypsum_Cave \"Gypsum Cave\") and [Tule\nSprings](/wiki/Tule_Springs_Archaeological_Site \"Tule Springs Archaeological\nSite\"). [Paiutes](/wiki/Paiute \"Paiute\") moved into the area as early as AD\n700, migrating between nearby mountains in the summer and spending winter in\nthe valley, near [Big Springs](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Springs \"Las Vegas\nSprings\").[5]\n\n## 1829–1905:\norigins[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: 1829–1905: origins\")]\n\nA trade caravan of 60 men led by the Mexican merchant [Antonio\nArmijo](/wiki/Antonio_Armijo \"Antonio Armijo\") was charged with establishing a\ntrade route to Los Angeles.[6][7] Las Vegas was named by Mexicans in the\nAntonio Armijo party.[8] By following the Pike and Smith routes through a\ntributary of Colorado River they came upon the Las Vegas Valley, described by\nSmith as the best point to re-supply before going onto California. The\ntravelers named the area \"Las Vegas\" which is Spanish for \"The Meadows\".[9]\n\n[John C. Frémont](/wiki/John_C._Fr%C3%A9mont \"John C. Frémont\") traveled into\nthe Las Vegas Valley on May 3, 1844, while it was still part of\n[Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\"). He was appointed by President [John\nTyler](/wiki/John_Tyler \"John Tyler\") to lead a group of\n[scientists](/wiki/Scientist \"Scientist\"), [scouts](/wiki/Reconnaissance\n\"Reconnaissance\"), and [spies](/wiki/Espionage \"Espionage\") for the [United\nStates Army Corps of Engineers](/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers\n\"United States Army Corps of Engineers\") who were preparing for a possible war\nwith Mexico. Upon arriving in the valley they made camp at the [Las Vegas\nSprings](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Springs \"Las Vegas Springs\"), establishing a\nclandestine fort there. A [war with Mexico](/wiki/Mexican-American_war\n\"Mexican-American war\") did occur, resulting in the region becoming United\nStates territory. The fort was used in later years by travellers, [mountain\nmen](/wiki/Mountain_man \"Mountain man\"), hunters, and traders seeking shelter,\nbut was never permanently inhabited.\n\nIn 1855, William Bringhurst led a group of 29 Mormon missionaries from Utah to\nthe Las Vegas Valley. The missionaries built a 150-square-foot (14 m2) adobe\nfort near a creek and used flood irrigation to water their crops, a process\nstill used at the park. However, because of tensions rising between leaders of\nthe small Mormon community, the summer heat and difficulty growing crops, the\nmissionaries returned to Utah in 1857, abandoning the fort.\n\nFor the next few years the area remained unoccupied by Americans except for\ntravelers and traders. Then the [U.S. Army](/wiki/United_States_Army \"United\nStates Army\"), in an attempt to deceive\n[Confederate](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of\nAmerica\") spies active in southern California in 1864, falsely publicized that\nit reclaimed the fort and had renamed it [Fort\nBaker](/w/index.php?title=Fort_Baker_\\(Nevada\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fort\nBaker \\(Nevada\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\"), briefly recalling the area to\nnational attention. After the end of the war in 1865, [Octavius\nGass](/wiki/Octavius_Gass \"Octavius Gass\"), with a commission from the federal\ngovernment, re-occupied the fort. The Paiute nation had declined in numbers\nand negotiated a new treaty with the United States, ceding the area around the\nfort to the United States in return for relocation and supplies of food and\nfarming equipment. Consequently, Gass started irrigating the old fields and\nrenamed the area 'Las Vegas Rancho.' Gass made wine at his ranch and Las Vegas\nbecame known as the best stop on the [Old Spanish\nTrail](/wiki/Old_Spanish_Trail_\\(trade_route\\) \"Old Spanish Trail \\(trade\nroute\\)\"). In 1881, because of mismanagement and intrigue with a Mormon\nsyndicate, Gass lost his ranch to [Archibald\nStewart](/w/index.php?title=Archibald_Stewart_\\(American_pioneer\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Archibald Stewart \\(American pioneer\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\") to pay off a\nlien Stewart had on the property.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\n1884, Archibald's wife, [Helen J. Stewart](/wiki/Helen_J._Stewart \"Helen J.\nStewart\") became the [Las Vegas Postmaster](/wiki/Postmaster \"Postmaster\").\n\nThe property (increased to 1,800 acres (730 ha)), stayed with the family\n(despite Archibald Stewart's murder in July 1884) until it was purchased in\n1902 by the [San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake\nRailroad](/wiki/Los_Angeles_and_Salt_Lake_Railroad \"Los Angeles and Salt Lake\nRailroad\"), then being built across southern Nevada. The railroad was a\nproject of [Montana](/wiki/Montana \"Montana\")\n[Senator](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\") [William Andrews\nClark](/wiki/William_Andrews_Clark \"William Andrews Clark\"). Clark enlisted\nUtah's U.S. Senator and mining magnate [Thomas Kearns](/wiki/Thomas_Kearns\n\"Thomas Kearns\") to ensure the line's completion through Utah to Las Vegas.\nThe State Land Act of 1885 offered land at $1.25 per acre ($3.09/hectare).\nClark and Kearns promoted the area to American farmers who quickly expanded\nthe farming plots of the areas. Not until 1895 did the first large-scale\nmigration of Mormons begin in the area, at long last fulfilling Brigham\nYoung's early dream. Through wells and arid irrigation, agriculture became the\nprimary industry for the next 20 years and in return for his development, the\nfarmers named the area Clark County in honor of the railroad tycoon and\nSenator.\n\n## 1905–1929: birth, growth and\ncrisis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1905–1929: birth, growth and crisis\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/StJoanofArcCatholicChurch_in_Las_Vegas_founded_1910.jpg/220px-\nStJoanofArcCatholicChurch_in_Las_Vegas_founded_1910.jpg)](/wiki/File:StJoanofArcCatholicChurch_in_Las_Vegas_founded_1910.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:StJoanofArcCatholicChurch_in_Las_Vegas_founded_1910.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nSt. Joan of Arc Catholic Church near 4th and Bridger in downtown was founded\nin 1910.[10]\n\nBy the early 20th century, water from wells was piped into the town, providing\nboth a reliable source of fresh water and the means for additional growth. The\nincreased availability of water in the area allowed Las Vegas to become a\n[water stop](/wiki/Water_stop \"Water stop\"), first for [wagon\ntrains](/wiki/Wagon_train \"Wagon train\") and later [railroads](/wiki/Railroad\n\"Railroad\"), on the trail between [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California\n\"Los Angeles, California\"), [California](/wiki/California \"California\"), and\npoints east such as [Albuquerque](/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico \"Albuquerque,\nNew Mexico\"), [New Mexico](/wiki/New_Mexico \"New Mexico\").\n\nThe [San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt\nLake](/wiki/Los_Angeles_and_Salt_Lake_Railroad \"Los Angeles and Salt Lake\nRailroad\") Railroad was completed in 1905, linking Salt Lake City to [southern\nCalifornia](/wiki/Southern_California \"Southern California\"). U.S. Senator\n[William Andrews Clark](/wiki/William_Andrews_Clark \"William Andrews Clark\")\nwas the majority owner of the railroad, which was a corporation based in Utah.\nAmong its original incorporators were Utah's U.S. Senator [Thomas\nKearns](/wiki/Thomas_Kearns \"Thomas Kearns\") and his business partner David\nKeith. Kearns, one of the richest and most powerful men in Utah, and Keith\nwere the owners of Utah's Silver King Coalition Mine, several mines in Nevada\nand _[The Salt Lake Tribune](/wiki/The_Salt_Lake_Tribune \"The Salt Lake\nTribune\")_ newspaper. Kearns and Keith helped Clark ensure the success of the\nnew railroad across Utah and into Nevada to California. Curiously, for a time\nthere were two towns named Las Vegas. The east-side of Las Vegas (which\nencompassed the modern Main Street and [Las Vegas\nBoulevard](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Boulevard \"Las Vegas Boulevard\")) was owned by\nClark, and the west-side Las Vegas (which encompassed the area north of\nmodern-day [Bonanza Road](/wiki/Bonanza_Road \"Bonanza Road\")) was owned by\nJ.T. McWilliams, who was hired by the Stewart family during the sale of the\nLas Vegas Rancho and bought available land west of the ranch. It was from\ntheir property that Las Vegas took form.\n\nClark subsequently built another railroad branching off from Las Vegas to the\nboomtown of [Bullfrog](/wiki/Bullfrog,_Nevada \"Bullfrog, Nevada\") called the\n[Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad](/wiki/Las_Vegas_and_Tonopah_Railroad \"Las\nVegas and Tonopah Railroad\"). With the revenue coming down both railways that\nintersected there, the area of Las Vegas was quickly growing. On May 15, 1905,\nLas Vegas officially was founded as a city, when 110 acres (45 ha), in what\nwould later become downtown, were auctioned to ready buyers. Las Vegas was the\ndriving force in the creation of [Clark County](/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada\n\"Clark County, Nevada\"), [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada \"Nevada\") in 1909 and the city\nwas incorporated in 1911 as a part of the county. The first mayor of Las Vegas\nwas [Peter Buol](/wiki/Peter_Buol \"Peter Buol\") who served from 1911-1913.\n\nShortly after the city's incorporation, the State of Nevada reluctantly became\nthe last western state to outlaw gaming. This occurred at midnight, October 1,\n1910, when a strict anti-gambling law became effective in Nevada. It even\nforbade the western custom of flipping a coin for the price of a drink.\nNonetheless, Las Vegas had a diversified economy and a stable and prosperous\nbusiness community, and therefore continued to grow until 1917. In that year,\na combination of economic influences and the redirection of resources by the\nfederal government in support of the war effort forced the [Las Vegas and\nTonopah Railroad](/wiki/Las_Vegas_and_Tonopah_Railroad \"Las Vegas and Tonopah\nRailroad\") to declare bankruptcy. Although William Clark sold the remains of\nthe company to the [Union Pacific Railroad](/wiki/Union_Pacific_Railroad\n\"Union Pacific Railroad\"), a nationwide strike in 1922 left Las Vegas in a\ndesperate state.\n\n## 1930–1941: Hoover Dam and the first\ncasinos[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 1930–1941: Hoover Dam and the first casinos\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Adams_Boulder_Dam_1942.jpg/220px-\nAdams_Boulder_Dam_1942.jpg)](/wiki/File:Adams_Boulder_Dam_1942.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Adams_Boulder_Dam_1942.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nHoover Dam in 1942\n\nOn July 3, 1930, President [Herbert Hoover](/wiki/Herbert_Hoover \"Herbert\nHoover\") signed the appropriation bill for the [Boulder Dam](/wiki/Hoover_Dam\n\"Hoover Dam\"). The dam was later renamed the Hoover Dam during the Truman\nadministration. Work started on the dam in 1931 and Las Vegas' population\nswelled from around 5,000 citizens to 25,000, with most of the newcomers\nlooking for a job building the dam. However, the demographic of the work force\nconsisting of males from across the country with no attachment to the area\ncreated a market for large scale entertainment. A combination of local Las\nVegas business owners, and Mafia crime lords helped develop the casinos and\n[showgirl](/wiki/Showgirl \"Showgirl\") theaters to entertain the largely male\ndam construction workers.[11]\n\nDespite the influx of known crime figures, the local business community tried\nto cast Las Vegas in a respectable light when the [Secretary of the\nInterior](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior \"United States\nSecretary of the Interior\") [Ray Lyman Wilbur](/wiki/Ray_Lyman_Wilbur \"Ray\nLyman Wilbur\") visited in 1929 to inspect the dam site. However a subordinate\nwas found with [alcohol](/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage \"Alcoholic beverage\") on his\nbreath (this was during the time of [Prohibition](/wiki/Prohibition\n\"Prohibition\")) after a visit to [Block\n16](/w/index.php?title=Block_16&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Block 16 \\(page does\nnot exist\\)\") in Las Vegas. The government ultimately decided that a federal-\ncontrolled town, [Boulder City](/wiki/Boulder_City,_Nevada \"Boulder City,\nNevada\"), would be erected for the dam workers.\n\nRealizing that gambling would be profitable for local business, the Nevada\nstate legislature legalized gambling at the local level in 1931. Las Vegas,\nwith a small but already well-established illegal gambling industry, was\npoised to begin its rise as the gaming capital of the world. The county issued\nthe first gambling license in 1931 to the [Northern\nClub](/wiki/Northern_Club_\\(casino\\) \"Northern Club \\(casino\\)\"), and soon\nother casinos were licensed on [Fremont Street](/wiki/Fremont_Street \"Fremont\nStreet\") like the [Las Vegas Club](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Club \"Las Vegas Club\") and\nthe [Apache Hotel](/w/index.php?title=Apache_Hotel&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Apache Hotel \\(page does not exist\\)\"). Fremont Street became the first paved\nstreet in Las Vegas[12] and received the city's first traffic light in 1931.\n\nIn reply, the federal government restricted movement of the dam workers to Las\nVegas. Smuggling and circuitous routes then were developed. In 1934, to\ncurtail these activities and the resulting growth of criminal figures in the\ngambling industry, the city's leading figures purged gambling dens and started\nan effort to stem the flow of workers from the dam. This only emboldened some\ndam workers who still contrived to visit Las Vegas. A celebration of this era\nhas become known as [Helldorado Days](/wiki/Helldorado_Days_\\(Las_Vegas\\)\n\"Helldorado Days \\(Las Vegas\\)\").[13]\n\nAlthough the suppression efforts resulted in declines at gambling venues and\nresulted in a business downturn, the city was recharged — both literally and\nfiguratively — when the dam was completed in 1935. In 1937, [Southern Nevada\nPower](/wiki/Nevada_Power \"Nevada Power\") became the first utility to supply\npower from the dam, and Las Vegas was its first customer. Electricity flowed\ninto Las Vegas and Fremont Street became known as [Glitter\nGulch](/wiki/Fremont_Street_Experience \"Fremont Street Experience\") due to the\nmany bright lights powered by electricity from Hoover Dam. Meanwhile, although\nthe dam worker population disappeared, Hoover Dam and its reservoir, [Lake\nMead](/wiki/Lake_Mead \"Lake Mead\"), turned into tourist attractions on their\nown and the need for additional higher class hotels became clear.\n\nIn 1940, [U.S. Route 95](/wiki/U.S._Route_95_\\(Nevada\\) \"U.S. Route 95\n\\(Nevada\\)\") was finally extended south into Las Vegas, giving the city two\nmajor access roads. Also in 1940 Las Vegas's first permanent [radio\nstation](/wiki/Radio_station \"Radio station\"), [KENO](/wiki/KENO \"KENO\"),\nbegan broadcasting replacing the niche occupied earlier by transient\nbroadcasters.\n\n## 1941–1945 war\nyears[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 1941–1945 war years\")]\n\nMain article: [Las Vegas in the 1940s](/wiki/Las_Vegas_in_the_1940s \"Las Vegas\nin the 1940s\")\n\nOn January 25, 1941 the [U.S. Army](/wiki/United_States_Army \"United States\nArmy\") established a flexible [gunnery\nschool](/w/index.php?title=Gunnery_school&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Gunnery\nschool \\(page does not exist\\)\") for the [United States Army Air\nCorps](/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Corps \"United States Army Air Corps\") in\nLas Vegas.

The gunnery school later would become [Nellis\nAir Force Base](/wiki/Nellis_Air_Force_Base \"Nellis Air Force Base\"). The U.S\nArmy was not pleased with the legal [prostitution](/wiki/Prostitution\n\"Prostitution\") in Las Vegas and in 1942 forced Las Vegas to outlaw the\npractice, putting Block 16, the local [red light\ndistrict](/wiki/Red_light_district \"Red light district\") permanently out of\nbusiness.\n\nOn April 3, 1941, hotel owner Thomas Hull opened the [El Rancho\nVegas](/wiki/El_Rancho_Vegas \"El Rancho Vegas\"). It was the first resort on\nwhat would become the [Las Vegas Strip](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip \"Las Vegas\nStrip\"). The hotel gained much of its fame from the gourmet\n[buffet](/wiki/Buffet \"Buffet\") that it offered.\n\nOn October 30, 1942, [R. E.\nGriffith](/w/index.php?title=R._E._Griffith&action=edit&redlink=1 \"R.

A few more resorts were built on and around Fremont Street but the\nnext hotel on the Strip publicly demonstrated the influence of [organized\ncrime](/wiki/Organized_crime \"Organized crime\") on Las Vegas. Although ethnic\norganized crime figures had been involved in some of the operations at the\nhotels, the Mafia bosses never owned or controlled the hotels and clubs which\nremained monopolized by hard-bitten local Las Vegas families who were\nunwilling to cede ground to the crime bosses and proved strong enough to push\nback. This changed in post-war Las Vegas when Jewish gangster [Bugsy\nSiegel](/wiki/Bugsy_Siegel \"Bugsy Siegel\"), with help from friend and fellow\nmob boss [Meyer Lansky](/wiki/Meyer_Lansky \"Meyer Lansky\"), poured money\nthrough Mormon-owned banks for cover of legitimacy and built [The\nFlamingo](/wiki/Flamingo_Las_Vegas \"Flamingo Las Vegas\") in 1946.\n\n## 1946–1955: postwar\nboom[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: 1946–1955: postwar boom\")]\n\nMain articles: [Las Vegas in the 1940s](/wiki/Las_Vegas_in_the_1940s \"Las\nVegas in the 1940s\") and [Las Vegas in the 1950s](/wiki/Las_Vegas_in_the_1950s\n\"Las Vegas in the 1950s\")\n\nThe Flamingo initially lost money and [Siegel](/wiki/Bugsy_Siegel \"Bugsy\nSiegel\") died in a hail of gunfire in Beverly Hills, California in the summer\nof 1947. Additionally, local police and Clark County Sheriff deputies were\nnotorious for their heavy-handed tactics toward mobsters who \"grew too big for\ntheir pants.\" However, many mobsters saw the potential that gambling offered\nin Las Vegas.

In\n1948, [McCarran Field](/wiki/McCarran_International_Airport \"McCarran\nInternational Airport\") was established for commercial air traffic. In 1957\nthe [University of Nevada, Las Vegas](/wiki/University_of_Nevada,_Las_Vegas\n\"University of Nevada, Las Vegas\") was first established, initially as a\nbranch of the [University of Nevada, Reno](/wiki/University_of_Nevada,_Reno\n\"University of Nevada, Reno\") and becoming independent in 1969. In 1959 the\n[Clark County Commission](/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada#Clark_County_Commission\n\"Clark County, Nevada\") built the [Las Vegas Convention\nCenter](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Convention_Center \"Las Vegas Convention Center\"),\nwhich would become a vital part of the area's economy.

Initially staying in the [Desert Inn](/wiki/Desert_Inn\n\"Desert Inn\"), he refused to vacate his room and instead decided to purchase\nthe entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas\nreal estate, hotels and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million and\nusing his considerable powers to take over many of the well known hotels,\nespecially the organized crime connected venues and he quickly became one of\nthe most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image\nof Las Vegas from its Wild West roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city.\n\n### Hank\nGreenspun[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Hank Greenspun\")]\n\nThe local newspaper _[Las Vegas Sun](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Sun \"Las Vegas Sun\")_ and\nits editor [Hank Greenspun](/wiki/Hank_Greenspun \"Hank Greenspun\") led a\ncrusade in those days to expose all the criminal ties, activities, and\ngovernment corruption in Las Vegas. His [investigative\nreporting](/wiki/Investigative_reporting \"Investigative reporting\") and\neditorials led to the exposure of [Clark County](/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada\n\"Clark County, Nevada\") Sheriff [Glen Jones](/wiki/Glen_Jones \"Glen Jones\")'\nownership of a [brothel](/wiki/Brothel \"Brothel\") and the resignation of\n[Lieutenant Governor](/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Nevada \"Lieutenant Governor\nof Nevada\") [Clifford A. Jones](/wiki/Clifford_A._Jones \"Clifford A. Jones\")\nas the state's national committeeman for the [Democratic\nParty](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party \\(United\nStates\\)\"). Before his death in 1989, Hank Greenspun founded [The Greenspun\nCorporation](/wiki/The_Greenspun_Corporation \"The Greenspun Corporation\") to\nmanage his family's assets, and it remains a major influence in Las Vegas,\nwith media holdings in print, television and the Internet; substantial real\nestate holdings; and ownership stakes in a number of casinos.\n\n### Local\ngovernment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Local government\")]\n\nOne problem for the City of Las Vegas was that the Strip did not reside in Las\nVegas . Because of this, the city lost tax revenue. There was a push to annex\nthe Strip by the City of Las Vegas, but [The Syndicate](/wiki/Organized_crime\n\"Organized crime\") used the Clark County Commissioners to pull a legal\nmaneuver by organizing the [Las Vegas Strip](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip \"Las Vegas\nStrip\") properties into an unincorporated township called\n[Paradise](/wiki/Paradise,_Nevada \"Paradise, Nevada\"). Under Nevada Law, an\nincorporated town, Las Vegas, cannot annex an unincorporated township. To this\nday, virtually all of the Strip remains outside the City of Las Vegas.\n\n###\nDesegregation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Desegregation\")]\n\nMuch like in other American settled counties and towns throughout the United\nStates, entertainment venues were segregated between black- and white-owned\nbusinesses. With almost all of the businesses owned and operated by whites,\n[Black Americans](/wiki/Black_Americans \"Black Americans\") were barred from\nentering the venues which remained focused, regardless of their legitimacy or\ncriminality, on entertaining a white-only clientele. As a result of property\ndeeds, businesses owned by or mainly serving non-whites were confined to clubs\non the \"west side\" of the tracks. This also was enforced in many of the work\npositions. Thus, [African Americans](/wiki/African_Americans \"African\nAmericans\") (except those who provided the labor for low-paying menial\npositions or entertainment) and Hispanics were limited in employment\noccupations at the white-owned clubs. However, because of employment deals\nwith black worker groups, many clubs favored black workers, and the\n[Hispanic](/wiki/Hispanic \"Hispanic\") population actually decreased ninety\npercent from 2,275 to just 236 by the mid-1950s.\n\nOrganized crime-owned businesses saw an opportunity in not dividing their\nclientele by race and, despite property deeds and city and county codes\nbarring such activities, made several attempts at\n[desegregating](/wiki/Desegregation \"Desegregation\") their businesses in the\nhopes of putting out of operation the non-white owned clubs and expanding\ntheir own market share. An attempt was made at forming an all-integrated\nnight-club modeled on the [Harlem](/wiki/Harlem \"Harlem\") Clubs of New York\nCity during the 1920s and 1930s, like those owned by German-Jewish gangster\n[Dutch Schultz](/wiki/Dutch_Schultz \"Dutch Schultz\"). On May 24, 1955, Jewish\ncrime boss Will Max Schwartz, along with other investors, opened the [Moulin\nRouge](/wiki/Moulin_Rouge_Las_Vegas \"Moulin Rouge Las Vegas\"). It was a very\nupscale and racially integrated casino that actually competed against the\nresorts on the Strip, especially the non-white owned strips on the west side.\nBy the end of the year, the casino closed as Schwartz and his partners had a\nfalling out, but the seeds for racial integration were sown.\n\nMany sources have credited [Frank Sinatra](/wiki/Frank_Sinatra \"Frank\nSinatra\") and the [Rat Pack](/wiki/Rat_Pack \"Rat Pack\") as a significant\ndriving force behind desegregation in the casinos.[16] One famous story tells\nof Sinatra's refusal to perform at the Sands Hotel unless the hotel provided\n[Sammy Davis Jr.](/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr. \"Sammy Davis Jr.\") with a room.[17]\nThe famed performing group made similar demands at other venues, forcing\nowners to amend their policies over time.[18]\n\nHowever, it took political action, most often supported by Jewish crime\ngroups, for racial desegregation to occur. In 1960, the NAACP threatened a\nprotest of the city's casinos for their policies. A meeting between the NAACP,\nthe mayor and local businessmen resulted in citywide casino desegregation,\nstarting with the employees. Many whites were attritioned from positions and\ntheir jobs given to the black unions. Along with the rest of the country, Las\nVegas experienced the [struggle for civil rights](/wiki/Civil_rights_movement\n\"Civil rights movement\"). Activists like [James B.\nMcMillan](/wiki/James_B._McMillan \"James B. McMillan\"), [Grant\nSawyer](/wiki/Grant_Sawyer \"Grant Sawyer\"), Bob Bailey, and [Charles\nKeller](/wiki/Charles_Keller \"Charles Keller\") dragged Las Vegas to racial\nintegration.\n\nAside from seeing no business advantage to excluding non-white customers from\ncasinos and clubs, the organized crime groups themselves were composed of\npeople of ethnicities (Jewish and Italian) that faced discrimination from\n[WASP](/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant \"White Anglo-Saxon Protestant\")\nAmerica and thus could understand the plight of blacks. This was also a\ndriving force behind the integration advocated by ethnic performers such as\nSinatra and Martin.\n\nAnother big force for equality was Mayor [Oran Gragson](/wiki/Oran_Gragson\n\"Oran Gragson\"). Spurred into local politics by a vigilante ring of cops who\nrepeatedly broke into his appliance store, he implemented infrastructure\nimprovements for the minority neighborhoods in Las Vegas, backed the NAACP in\nits actions, and promoted black workers for jobs. He also championed the cause\nof the [Paiute\ntribe](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Tribe_of_Paiute_Indians_of_the_Las_Vegas_Indian_Colony\n\"Las Vegas Tribe of Paiute Indians of the Las Vegas Indian Colony\") that owned\na small portion of Las Vegas. Gragson stopped the U.S. government from\nevicting the tribe and actually made infrastructure improvements for them. His\nwork helped reverse the decrease of minority populations in Las Vegas.\n\nLocal legislation kept up with the national legislation and integration was\nfinally established. The only real violence came as a result of school\nintegration, with violent riots and fights occurring in [Clark High\nSchool](/wiki/Ed_W._Clark_High_School \"Ed W. Clark High School\") when black\ngangs and youths began attacking the whites. Integration sparked [white\nflight](/wiki/White_flight \"White flight\") from the school district from 1965\nto 1971.that school was then later destroyed.\n\n## 1970-1988: Explosive\ngrowth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: 1970-1988: Explosive growth\")]\n\nOn a percentage basis, Las Vegas and Clark County experienced incredibly high\ngrowth rates starting in the 1930s and lasting until the [late 2000s\nrecession](/wiki/Great_Recession \"Great Recession\"). During that period, the\npopulation of the city more than doubled in most decades. The rate slowed down\nin the 1970s with the decrease of the white birth rate, but never dropped\nbelow 60% (1980–1990), and even accelerated after 1990 due to immigration. By\n2000, Las Vegas was the largest city founded in the 20th century,[19] and by\n2006 it was the 28th largest city in the US, with a population of 552,000 in\nthe city and nearly 1.8 million in Clark County. The explosive growth resulted\nin rapid development of commercial and residential areas throughout the Las\nVegas Valley. The strong boom in the resort business led to many new\ncondominium developments all along the Strip and downtown area. Also [urban\nsprawl](/wiki/Urban_sprawl \"Urban sprawl\") development of single-family homes\ncontinued across the valley, building the areas of Henderson, [North Las\nVegas](/wiki/North_Las_Vegas \"North Las Vegas\"), Centennial Hills, and\n[Summerlin](/wiki/Summerlin \"Summerlin\"). The rapid development and population\ngrowth both halted abruptly in the late 2000s recession.[20][21]\n\nDuring this period of time, American author and journalist [Hunter S.\nThompson](/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson \"Hunter S. Thompson\") wrote and published\nhis seminal novel, _[Fear and Loathing in Las\nVegas](/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas_\\(novel\\) \"Fear and Loathing in\nLas Vegas \\(novel\\)\")_ , detailing the experience of his 1971 trip to the\ncity.\n\nOn November 21, 1980 the [MGM Grand Hotel and\nCasino](/wiki/MGM_Grand_Hotel_and_Casino \"MGM Grand Hotel and Casino\"),\nsuffered a [devastating fire](/wiki/MGM_Grand_fire \"MGM Grand fire\"). A total\nof 85 people died and 785 were injured in what remains the worst disaster in\nNevada history. The property was eventually sold and reopened as [Bally's Las\nVegas](/wiki/Bally%27s_Las_Vegas \"Bally's Las Vegas\"), while MGM moved south\nto [Tropicana Avenue](/wiki/Tropicana_Avenue \"Tropicana Avenue\").\n\n## Since 1989: the megaresort\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Since 1989: the megaresort era\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Las_Vegas_89.jpg/300px-\nLas_Vegas_89.jpg)](/wiki/File:Las_Vegas_89.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Las_Vegas_89.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Strip resorts in late 2009\n\nThe \"Mafia/Rat Pack\" Las Vegas of the mid-20th century came to a gradual end\nin the 1980s with the aging out of the World War II generation, the decline of\norganized crime elements, and the rise of baby boomer entrepreneurs who began\na new chapter in the city's history, the so-called\n[megaresort](/wiki/Megaresort \"Megaresort\") era. Las Vegas began to become a\nmore commercialized, family-oriented place with large corporations coming to\nown the hotels, casinos, and nightclubs in place of Mafia bosses. The\n[megaresort](/wiki/Megaresort \"Megaresort\") era kicked off in 1989 with the\nconstruction of [The Mirage](/wiki/The_Mirage \"The Mirage\").

Its 3,044 rooms,\neach with gold tinted windows, set a new standard for Vegas luxury and\nattracted tourists in droves, leading to additional financing and rapid growth\non the [Las Vegas Strip](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip \"Las Vegas Strip\").

Some of\nthese projects included the [MGM Mirage](/wiki/MGM_Mirage \"MGM Mirage\")\nproperty of [CityCenter](/wiki/CityCenter \"CityCenter\"),\n[Fontainebleau](/wiki/Fontainebleau_Resort_Las_Vegas \"Fontainebleau Resort Las\nVegas\"), [Echelon](/wiki/Echelon_Place \"Echelon Place\"), and [The\nPlaza](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Plaza \"Las Vegas Plaza\"). The global financial\nsituation also had a negative effect on gaming and tourism revenue, causing\nmany of the companies to report net loss. However starting in 2013, the sector\nbegan to turn around with the proposal of the Resorts World projects replacing\nthe Echelon currently under construction. The Alon resort is planned to resume\nthe site formerly the Frontier and originally planned for the Plaza.\nFontainbleau is currently being on the process of being sold and resumed. Wynn\nResorts is also planning an additional tower with a central lake planned for\n2020 and a new stadium opened near the New York New York hotel on 2016.\n\nLas Vegas has still managed to host many conventions and major events, such as\nthe annual [Latin Grammy Awards](/wiki/Latin_Grammy_Awards \"Latin Grammy\nAwards\"), & the [Consumer Electronics Show](/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show\n\"Consumer Electronics Show\").\n\nMany analysts agree that the Las Vegas economy is recovering, with improving\nconditions in tourism and the housing market for 2013.[22][23] Prices are\nrising and there has been a large increase in the million dollar home market,\nwith many new custom homes being built. January 2013 marks the 19th\nconsecutive month with home sales higher than the same month in the previous\nyear.[24] In addition, Las Vegas was named America's Top Turn Around Market\nfor 2012 by [Trulia](/wiki/Trulia \"Trulia\").[25]\n\nIn June 2017, a [heat wave](/wiki/2017_North_American_heat_wave \"2017 North\nAmerican heat wave\") grounded more than 40 airline flights of small aircraft\nwere grounded, with [American Airlines](/wiki/American_Airlines \"American\nAirlines\") reducing sales on certain flights to prevent the vehicles from\nbeing over the maximum weight permitted for safe takeoff and [Las\nVegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas \"Las Vegas\") tying its record high at 117 [degrees\nFahrenheit](/wiki/Degrees_Fahrenheit \"Degrees Fahrenheit\").[26]\n\nDuring the late evening of October 1, 2017, Las Vegas became the scene of the\ndeadliest [mass shooting](/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_Strip_shooting \"2017 Las Vegas\nStrip shooting\") in the history of the United States, when a gunman opened\nfire on country-music festival goers, killing 59 and injuring more than\n500.[27]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Timeline of Las Vegas](/wiki/Timeline_of_Las_Vegas \"Timeline of Las Vegas\")\n  * [Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign](/wiki/Welcome_to_Fabulous_Las_Vegas_sign \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Las_Vegas&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [History of Las Vegas](http://www.lvol.com/lvoleg/hist/lvhist.html)\n  2. **Jump up ^** Robert D.
