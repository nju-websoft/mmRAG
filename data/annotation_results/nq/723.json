        "# Internet in the Philippines\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\n**Internet in the Philippines** first became available on March 29, 1994, with\nthe Philippine Network Foundation (PHNet) connecting the country and its\npeople to [Sprint](/wiki/Sprint_Nextel \"Sprint Nextel\") in the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") via a 64 kbit/s link.[1][2][3] As\nof 2016, more than 44,000,000 people used the internet in the country,\naccounting for 43.5% of the total population.[4]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg/220px-\nInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg.png)](/wiki/File:InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWorld map of internet penetration (number of Internet users as a percentage of\na country's population), 2012[5]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/InternetUsersWorldMap.svg/220px-\nInternetUsersWorldMap.svg.png)](/wiki/File:InternetUsersWorldMap.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:InternetUsersWorldMap.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWorld map of internet users, 2012[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Timeline\n  * 2 Statistics\n  * 3 Wireless broadband\n    * 3.1 TD-LTE\n      * 3.1.1 Bandwidth caps\n      * 3.1.2 Lock-in period\n  * 4 IP peering\n  * 5 Internet speed\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Internet_in_the_Philippines&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nA year after the connection, The Public Telecommunications Act of the\nPhilippines was made into law. Securing a [franchise](/wiki/Franchising\n\"Franchising\") is now optional for [value-added service](/wiki/Value-\nadded_service \"Value-added service\") providers. This law enabled many other\norganizations to establish connections to the Internet, to create Web sites\nand have their own Internet services or provide Internet service and access to\nothers.\n\nHowever the growth of the Internet in the Philippines was hindered by many\nobstacles including unequal distribution of Internet infrastructure throughout\nthe country, its cost and corruption in the government.[6] But these obstacles\ndid not altogether halt all the developments. More connection types were made\navailable to more Filipinos. Increasing bandwidth and a growing number of\nFilipino Internet users were proof of the continuing development of the\nInternet in the country.\n\nThe [Cybercrime Prevention Act of\n2012](/wiki/Cybercrime_Prevention_Act_of_2012 \"Cybercrime Prevention Act of\n2012\"), codified as _Republic Act No. 10175_ , criminalized\n[cybersquatting](/wiki/Cybersquatting \"Cybersquatting\"),\n[cybersex](/wiki/Cybersex \"Cybersex\"), [child\npornography](/wiki/Child_pornography \"Child pornography\"), [identity\ntheft](/wiki/Identity_theft \"Identity theft\"), illegal access to data and\n[libel](/wiki/Libel \"Libel\").[7] The act has been criticized for its provision\non criminalizing libel, which is perceived to be a curtailment in freedom of\nexpression. After several petitions submitted to the [Supreme Court of the\nPhilippines](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines \"Supreme Court of the\nPhilippines\") questioned the constitutionality of the Act,[8] the Supreme\nCourt issued a [temporary restraining order](/wiki/Temporary_restraining_order\n\"Temporary restraining order\") on October 9, 2012, stopping implementation of\nthe Act for 120 days.[9]\n\nA [Magna Carta for Philippine Internet\nFreedom](/wiki/Magna_Carta_for_Philippine_Internet_Freedom \"Magna Carta for\nPhilippine Internet Freedom\") was filed in the Philippine legislature in 2013\nto, among others, repeal Republic Act No. 10175.[10] The Implementing Rules\nand Regulations of Republic Act No 10175 were promulgated on August 12,\n2015.[11]\n\n###\nTimeline[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Internet_in_the_Philippines&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Timeline\")]\n\nThe early history of the Internet in the Philippines started with the\nestablishment of Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) by computer hobbyist and\nenthusiast. They were able to link their BBS’s using a dial-up connection\nprotocol enabling them to participate in discussion forums, send messages and\nshare files. [12][13]\n\n**1986** : Establishment of first BBS in the Philippines, Star BBS was formed\nby Efren Tercias and James Chua of Wordtext Systems. Fox BBS was operated by\nJohnson Sumpio. First-Fil RBBS a public-access BBS went online with an annual\nsubscription fee of P1,000. A precursor to the local online forum, it ran an\nopen-source BBS software on an IBM XT Clone PC with a 1200bit/s modem and was\noperated by Dan Angeles and Ed Castañeda.\n\n**1987** : The Philippine FidoNet Exchange, a local network for communication\nbetween several BBSes in Metro Manila, was formed.\n\n**1990** : A committee helmed by Arnie del Rosario of the Ateneo Computer\nTechnology Center was tasked with exploring the possibility of creating an\nacademic network of universities and government institutions by the National\nComputer Center under Dr. William Torres. Recommendations were made but not\nimplemented.\n\n**1991-1993** : Emergence of email gateways and services in the Philippines,\nincluding some from multinational companies like Intel, Motorola, and Texas\nInstruments, which used a direct Internet connection, X.25, or UUCP protocol.\nLocal firms ETPI, Philcom, and [PLDT](/wiki/PLDT \"PLDT\") (Philippine Long\nDistance Telephone Company) also operated commercial X.25 networks. Another\nmilestone: Local and international email to FidoNet users was introduced.\n\n**June 1993** : With the support of the Department of Science and Technology\nand the Industrial Research Foundation, the Philnet project (now PHNET) was\nborn. The Philnet technical committee, composed of computer buffs working at\nthe DOST [MIS (Joseph Andres), PCASTRD (Merl Opena, Winnefredo Aggabao) and\nAdvanced Science and Technology Institute (Miguel Dimayuga)] and\nrepresentatives from the Ateneo de Manila University (Richie Lozada and Arnie\ndel Rosario), De La Salle University (Kelsey Hartigan-Go), University of the\nPhilippines Diliman (Rodel Atanacio), University of the Philippines Los Baños\n(Alfonso Carandang), Xavier University (Bombim Cadiz) and St. Louis University\n(Ian Generalao); would eventually play a significant role in connecting the\nPhilippines to the global Internet.[14]\n\n**July 1993** : Phase one of the Philnet project shifted into full gear after\nreceiving funding from the DOST. It proved to be successful, as students from\npartner universities were able to send emails to the Internet by routing them\nthrough Philnet's gateway at the Ateneo de Manila University, which was\nconnected to another gateway at the Victoria University of Technology in\nAustralia via IDD Dial-Up (Hayes Modem).[15]\n\n**November 1993** : An additional P12.5-million grant for the first year's\nrunning cost was awarded by the DOST to buy equipment and lease communication\nlines needed to kickstart the second phase of Philnet, now led by Dr. Rudy\nVillarica.\n\n**March 29, 1994** , 1:15 a.m.: Benjie Tan, who was working for ComNet, a\ncompany that supplied Cisco routers to the Philnet project, established the\nPhilippine's first connection to the Internet at a PLDT network center in\nMakati City. Shortly thereafter, he posted a short message to the Usenet\nnewsgroup soc.culture.filipino to alert Filipinos overseas that a link had\nbeen made. His message read: \"As of March 29, 1994 at 1:15 am Philippine time,\nunfortunately 2 days late due to slight technical difficulties, the\nPhilippines was FINALLY connected to the Internet via SprintLink. The\nPhilippine router, a Cisco 7000 router was attached via the services of PLDT\nand Sprint communications to SprintLink's router at Stockton Ca. The gateway\nto the world for the Philippines will be via NASA Ames Research Center. For\nnow, a 64K serial link is the information highway to the rest of the Internet\nworld.\"\n\n**March 29, 1994** , 10:18 a.m.: \"We're in,\" Dr. John Brule, a Professor\nEmeritus in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Syracuse University,\nannounced at The First International E-Mail Conference at the University of\nSan Carlos in Talamban, Cebu, signifying that Philnet's 64 kbit/s connection\nwas live.\n\n##\nStatistics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Internet_in_the_Philippines&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Statistics\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/USMC-101015-M-3989H-001.jpg/220px-\nUSMC-101015-M-3989H-001.jpg)](/wiki/File:USMC-101015-M-3989H-001.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:USMC-101015-M-3989H-001.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nInternet café in the Philippines\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Browser_Market_Map_June_2015.svg/220px-\nBrowser_Market_Map_June_2015.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Browser_Market_Map_June_2015.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Browser_Market_Map_June_2015.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWorldmap of internet browsers.

According to PLDT, they spent P2 billion of its\nP28.8 billion capital expenditure for 2013 to bring TD-LTE technology to\ncustomers’ homes. According to industry data, the Philippines’ TD-LTE network\nwas one of the largest deployments in Asia Pacific with over 200 base stations\nand an allocated bandwidth of 100 megabits per second (Mbps).[18]\n\nIn January 2015, both PLDT and Globe Telecom began phasing out WiMax services\nin favor for TD-LTE.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n#### Bandwidth\ncaps[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Internet_in_the_Philippines&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Bandwidth caps\")]\n\nIn October 2015, [PLDT](/wiki/PLDT \"PLDT\") introduced so-called \"volume\nboosters\" (instead of 30% bandwidth throttling in 2014 and 256kbit/s bandwidth\nthrottling in 2015) when exceeding monthly 30GB to 70GB bandwidth cap for TD-\nLTE connection plans (Ultera). \"In case your usage exceeds your monthly volume\nallowance, you can still enjoy the internet by purchasing additional volume\nboosters. Otherwise, connectivity will be halted until your monthly volume is\nrefreshed on your next billing cycle.\"[19] Globe followed the suit with a\nsimilar \"volume boost\" arrangement.[20]\n\n#### Lock-in\nperiod[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Internet_in_the_Philippines&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Lock-in period\")]\n\nIn 2015, [PLDT](/wiki/PLDT \"PLDT\") increased lock-in period for TD-LTE\nconnection plans from 24 to 36 months (3 years) with the pre-termination fee\nequal to the full balance for the remaining period. After the lock-in period\nthe contract is automatically renewed for another 36 months subject to the\nsame terms and conditions.[21] As of\nnow[_[timeframe?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Relative_time_references\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] the Globe lock-in period is\nstill 2 years with no pre-termination fee outside of the lock-in period.[22]\nThe PLDT TD-LTE contract allows PLDT to change the terms and conditions at any\ntime with the only way left for subscribers to opt out of the altered service\nthrough paying the full pre-termination fee: \"8.3 Modification.
