Its walls are rigid and has valves so the blood\ndoes not flow down via [gravity](/wiki/Gravity \"Gravity\"). It is formed by the\njoining of the right and the left [common iliac veins](/wiki/Common_iliac_vein\n\"Common iliac vein\"), usually at the level of the fifth [lumbar\nvertebra](/wiki/Lumbar_vertebra \"Lumbar vertebra\").\n\nThe inferior vena cava is the lower\n(\"[inferior](/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Superior_and_inferior\n\"Anatomical terms of location\")\") of the two [venae cavae](/wiki/Venae_cavae\n\"Venae cavae\"), the two large [veins](/wiki/Vein \"Vein\") that carry\ndeoxygenated [blood](/wiki/Blood \"Blood\") from the body: the inferior vena\ncava carries blood from the lower half of the body whilst the [superior vena\ncava](/wiki/Superior_vena_cava \"Superior vena cava\") carries blood from the\nupper half of the body.\n\nIt is a large [retroperitoneal](/wiki/Retroperitoneal \"Retroperitoneal\") vein\nthat lies [posterior](/wiki/Posterior_\\(anatomy\\) \"Posterior \\(anatomy\\)\") to\nthe [abdominal cavity](/wiki/Abdominal_cavity \"Abdominal cavity\") and runs\nalong the right side of the [vertebral column](/wiki/Vertebral_column\n\"Vertebral column\"). It enters the right atrium at the lower right, back side\nof the heart. The name derives from [Latin](/wiki/Latin_language \"Latin\nlanguage\"): _vena, \"vein\", cavus, \"hollow\"_.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Structure\n    * 1.1 Tributaries\n    * 1.2 Development\n    * 1.3 Variation\n  * 2 Function\n  * 3 Clinical significance\n  * 4 Additional images\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n##\nStructure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inferior_vena_cava&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Structure\")]\n\nThe inferior vena cava is formed by the joining of the left and right [common\niliac veins](/wiki/Common_iliac_vein \"Common iliac vein\") and brings collected\nblood into the [right atrium](/wiki/Right_atrium \"Right atrium\") of the heart.\nIt also [joins](/wiki/Anastomosis \"Anastomosis\") with the [azygos\nvein](/wiki/Azygos_vein \"Azygos vein\") (which runs on the right side of the\nvertebral column) and venous [plexuses](/wiki/Plexus \"Plexus\") next to the\n[spinal cord](/wiki/Spinal_cord \"Spinal cord\").\n\nThe inferior vena cava begins as the left and right common iliac veins behind\nthe [abdomen](/wiki/Abdomen \"Abdomen\") unite, at about the level of\n[L5](/wiki/Lumbar_vertebra \"Lumbar vertebra\"). It passes through the [thoracic\ndiaphragm](/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm \"Thoracic diaphragm\") at the [caval\nopening](/wiki/Caval_opening \"Caval opening\") at the level of\n[T8](/wiki/Thoracic_vertebra \"Thoracic vertebra\").\n\n###\nTributaries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inferior_vena_cava&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Tributaries\")]\n\nThe specific levels of the tributaries are as follows:\n\n**Level** | **Vein**  \n---|---  \nT8 | [hepatic veins](/wiki/Hepatic_veins \"Hepatic veins\"), [inferior phrenic vein](/wiki/Inferior_phrenic_vein \"Inferior phrenic vein\")  \nL1 | right [suprarenal vein](/wiki/Suprarenal_vein \"Suprarenal vein\"), [renal veins](/wiki/Renal_veins \"Renal veins\")  \nL2 | right [gonadal vein](/wiki/Gonadal_vein \"Gonadal vein\")  \nL1–L5 | [lumbar veins](/wiki/Lumbar_veins \"Lumbar veins\")  \nL5 | [common iliac veins](/wiki/Common_iliac_veins \"Common iliac veins\")  \n  \nBecause the inferior vena cava is located to the right of the midline,\ndrainage of the tributaries is not always symmetrical. On the right, the\n[gonadal veins](/wiki/Gonadal_vein \"Gonadal vein\") and [suprarenal\nveins](/wiki/Suprarenal_vein \"Suprarenal vein\") drain into the inferior vena\ncava directly. On the left, they drain into the [renal vein](/wiki/Renal_vein\n\"Renal vein\") which in turn drains into the inferior vena cava. By contrast,\nall the [lumbar veins](/wiki/Lumbar_veins \"Lumbar veins\") and [hepatic\nveins](/wiki/Hepatic_veins \"Hepatic veins\") usually drain directly into the\ninferior vena cava.\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inferior_vena_cava&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nIn the [embryo](/wiki/Embryo \"Embryo\"), the inferior vena cava and right\natrium are separated by the [valve of the inferior vena\ncava](/wiki/Valve_of_the_inferior_vena_cava \"Valve of the inferior vena\ncava\"), also known as the _Eustachian valve_. In the adult, this valve\ntypically has totally regressed or remains as a small fold of\n[endocardium](/wiki/Endocardium \"Endocardium\").[1]\n\n###\nVariation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inferior_vena_cava&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Variation\")]\n\nRarely, the inferior vena cava may vary in its size and position. In\n[transposition of the great\narteries](/wiki/Transposition_of_the_great_arteries \"Transposition of the\ngreat arteries\") the inferior vena cava may lie on the left. It may be\nreplaced by two vessels beneath the level of the renal veins.[2]\n\n## Function[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inferior_vena_cava&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Function\")]\n\nThe inferior vena cava is a [vein](/wiki/Vein \"Vein\"). It carries deoxygenated\nblood from the lower half of the body to the [right atrium](/wiki/Right_atrium\n\"Right atrium\") of the [heart](/wiki/Heart \"Heart\").[2]\n\nThe corresponding vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper half of\nthe body is the [superior vena cava](/wiki/Superior_vena_cava \"Superior vena\ncava\").\n\n## Clinical\nsignificance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inferior_vena_cava&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Clinical significance\")]\n\nHealth problems attributed to the IVC are most often associated with it being\ncompressed (ruptures are rare because it has a low\n[intraluminal](/wiki/Lumen_\\(anatomy\\) \"Lumen \\(anatomy\\)\")\n[pressure](/wiki/Pressure \"Pressure\")). Typical sources of external pressure\nare an enlarged [aorta](/wiki/Aorta \"Aorta\") ([abdominal aortic\naneurysm](/wiki/Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm \"Abdominal aortic aneurysm\")), the\n[gravid](/wiki/Pregnant \"Pregnant\") [uterus](/wiki/Uterus \"Uterus\")\n([aortocaval compression syndrome](/wiki/Aortocaval_compression_syndrome\n\"Aortocaval compression syndrome\")) and abdominal maligancies, such as\n[colorectal cancer](/wiki/Colorectal_cancer \"Colorectal cancer\"), [renal cell\ncarcinoma](/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma \"Renal cell carcinoma\") and [ovarian\ncancer](/wiki/Ovarian_cancer \"Ovarian cancer\"). Since the inferior vena cava\nis primarily a right-sided structure, unconscious pregnant women should be\nturned on to their left side (the [recovery position](/wiki/Recovery_position\n\"Recovery position\")), to relieve pressure on it and facilitate venous return\n{{citation needed}}. In rare cases, straining associated with\n[defecation](/wiki/Defecation \"Defecation\") can lead to restricted blood flow\nthrough the IVC and result in [syncope](/wiki/Fainting \"Fainting\")\n(fainting).[3]\n\nBlockage of the inferior vena cava is rare, and is treated urgently as a life-\nthreatening condition. It is associated with [deep vein\nthrombosis](/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis \"Deep vein thrombosis\"), [IVC\nfilters](/wiki/IVC_filter \"IVC filter\"), [liver\ntransplantation](/wiki/Liver_transplantation \"Liver transplantation\") and\n[surgical procedures](/wiki/Surgical_procedures \"Surgical procedures\") such as\nthe insertion of a [catheter](/wiki/Catheter \"Catheter\") in the [femoral\nvein](/wiki/Femoral_vein \"Femoral vein\") in the [groin](/wiki/Groin\n\"Groin\").[4]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Major_Veins.png/220px-\nMajor_Veins.png)](/wiki/File:Major_Veins.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Major_Veins.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nBranches of Inferior Vena Cava\n\nTrauma to the vena cava is usually fatal as unstoppable [excessive blood\nloss](/wiki/Exsanguination \"Exsanguination\") occurs.\n\n## Additional\nimages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inferior_vena_cava&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Additional images\")]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Inferiorvenacava.png/67px-Inferiorvenacava.png)](/wiki/File:Inferiorvenacava.png)\n\nInferior vena cava\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Slide10bek.JPG/120px-Slide10bek.JPG)](/wiki/File:Slide10bek.JPG)\n\nInferior vena cava front view\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inferior_vena_cava&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Atriocaval shunt](/wiki/Atriocaval_shunt \"Atriocaval shunt\")\n  * [Inferior vena cava syndrome](/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava_syndrome \"Inferior vena cava syndrome\")\n  * [Recovery position](/wiki/Recovery_position \"Recovery position\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inferior_vena_cava&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Turhan Yavuz; Nazli, C; Kinay, O; Kutsal, A (2002).
