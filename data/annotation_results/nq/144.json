Known as the \"**Father\nof Texas** \", and the founder of [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\"),[1][2] he led\nthe second, and ultimately, the successful colonization of the region by\nbringing [300 families](/wiki/Old_Three_Hundred \"Old Three Hundred\") from the\nUnited States to the region in 1825.\n\nBorn in [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\") and raised in southeastern\n[Missouri](/wiki/Missouri \"Missouri\"), Austin served in the Missouri\nterritorial legislature before moving to [Arkansas\nTerritory](/wiki/Arkansas_Territory \"Arkansas Territory\") and later\n[Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\"). His father, [Moses\nAustin](/wiki/Moses_Austin \"Moses Austin\"), received an empresario grant from\n[Spain](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\") to settle Texas. After Moses Austin's death in\n1821, Stephen Austin won recognition of the empresario grant from the newly-\nindependent state of [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\"). Austin convinced\nnumerous American settlers to move to Texas, and by 1825 Austin had brought\nthe first 300 American families into the territory. Throughout the 1820s,\nAustin sought to maintain good relations with the Mexican government, and he\nhelped suppress the [Fredonian Rebellion](/wiki/Fredonian_Rebellion \"Fredonian\nRebellion\"). He also helped ensure the introduction of [slavery](/wiki/Slavery\n\"Slavery\") into Texas despite the attempts of the Mexican government to ban\nthe institution.\n\nAs Texas settlers became increasingly dissatisfied with the Mexican\ngovernment, Austin advocated conciliation with the Mexican government, but the\ndissent against Mexico escalated into the [Texas\nRevolution](/wiki/Texas_Revolution \"Texas Revolution\"). Austin led Texas\nforces at the successful [Siege of Béxar](/wiki/Siege_of_B%C3%A9xar \"Siege of\nBéxar\") before serving as a commissioner to the United States. Austin ran in\nthe [1836 Texas presidential\nelection](/wiki/Republic_of_Texas_presidential_election,_1836 \"Republic of\nTexas presidential election, 1836\") but was defeated by [Sam\nHouston](/wiki/Sam_Houston \"Sam Houston\"). Houston appointed Austin as\nsecretary of state for the new republic, and Austin held that position until\nhis death in December 1836.\n\nNumerous places and institutions are named in his honor, including the capital\nof Texas, [Austin](/wiki/Austin,_Texas \"Austin, Texas\") in [Travis\nCounty](/wiki/Travis_County,_Texas \"Travis County, Texas\"), [Austin\nCounty](/wiki/Austin_County,_Texas \"Austin County, Texas\"), [Austin\nBayou](/wiki/Austin_Bayou \"Austin Bayou\"), [Stephen F.

Austin in his birthplace\n\nStephen F. Austin was born in the [mining](/wiki/Mining \"Mining\") region of\n[southwestern](/wiki/Ordinal_directions \"Ordinal directions\") Virginia ([Wythe\nCounty](/wiki/Wythe_County,_Virginia \"Wythe County, Virginia\")) in what is\nknown as [Austinville](/wiki/Austinville,_Virginia \"Austinville, Virginia\")\ntoday, some 256 miles (412 km) southwest of [Richmond,\nVirginia](/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia \"Richmond, Virginia\").[3] He was the second\nchild of [Mary Brown Austin](/wiki/Mary_Brown_Austin \"Mary Brown Austin\") and\n[Moses Austin](/wiki/Moses_Austin \"Moses Austin\"); the first, Eliza, lived\nonly one month. On June 8, 1798, when Stephen was four years old, his family\nmoved west to the lead-mining region of present-day [Potosi,\nMissouri](/wiki/Potosi,_Missouri \"Potosi, Missouri\"), 40 miles west of the\n[Mississippi River](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\"). His father\nMoses Austin received a _sitio_[4] from the Spanish government for the mining\nsite of _Mine à Breton_ , established by French colonists. His great-great-\ngrandfather, Anthony Austin (b.1636), was the son of [Richard\nAustin](/wiki/Richard_Austin_\\(colonist\\) \"Richard Austin \\(colonist\\)\")\n(b.1598 in [Bishopstoke](/wiki/Bishopstoke \"Bishopstoke\"),\n[Hampshire](/wiki/Hampshire \"Hampshire\"), England), he and his wife Esther\nwere original settlers of [Suffield,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Suffield,_Massachusetts \"Suffield, Massachusetts\"), which\nbecame Connecticut in 1749.[5]\n\nWhen Austin was eleven years old, his family sent him back east to be\neducated, first at the preparatory school of [Bacon\nAcademy](/wiki/Bacon_Academy \"Bacon Academy\") in [Colchester,\nConnecticut](/wiki/Colchester,_Connecticut \"Colchester, Connecticut\"), and\nthen at [Transylvania University](/wiki/Transylvania_University \"Transylvania\nUniversity\") in [Lexington, Kentucky](/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky \"Lexington,\nKentucky\"), from which he graduated in 1810.[6] After graduation, Austin began\nstudying to be a lawyer. At age 21, he served in the\n[legislature](/wiki/Legislature \"Legislature\") of the [Missouri\nTerritory](/wiki/Missouri_Territory \"Missouri Territory\"). As a member of the\nterritorial legislature, he was \"influential in obtaining a charter for the\nstruggling Bank of St. Louis.\"[7]\n\nLeft penniless after the [Panic of 1819](/wiki/Panic_of_1819 \"Panic of 1819\"),\nAustin decided to move south to the new [Arkansas\nTerritory](/wiki/Arkansas_Territory \"Arkansas Territory\").[6] He acquired\nproperty on the south bank of the Arkansas River, in the area that would later\nbecome [Little Rock](/wiki/Little_Rock,_Arkansas \"Little Rock, Arkansas\").\nAfter purchasing the property, he learned the area was being considered as the\nlocation for the new territorial capital, which could make his land worth a\ngreat deal more.[8] He made his home in [Hempstead County,\nArkansas](/wiki/Hempstead_County,_Arkansas \"Hempstead County, Arkansas\"). Two\nweeks before the first Arkansas territorial elections in 1820, Austin declared\nhis candidacy for Congress. His late entrance meant his name did not appear on\nthe ballot in two of the five counties, but he still placed second in the\nfield of six candidates. Later, he was appointed as a judge for the First\nCircuit Court.[8] Over the next few months, Little Rock did become the\nterritorial capital, but Austin's claim to land in the area was contested, and\nthe courts ruled against him. The Territorial Assembly reorganized the\ngovernment and abolished Austin's judgeship.[8]\n\nAustin left the territory, moving to [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\").\nHe reached [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans,_Louisiana \"New Orleans,\nLouisiana\") in November 1820, where he met and stayed with a New Orleans\nlawyer and former Kentucky congressman, [Joseph H.\nHawkins](/wiki/Joseph_H._Hawkins \"Joseph H. Hawkins\"), and made arrangements\nto study [law](/wiki/Law \"Law\").\n\n## Moving to Texas\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/The_Alamo_1936_Issue-3c.jpg/250px-\nThe_Alamo_1936_Issue-3c.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Alamo_1936_Issue-3c.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Alamo_1936_Issue-3c.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Sam Houston](/wiki/Sam_Houston \"Sam Houston\") and Stephen Austin depicted on\nthe [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\") Centennial Issue [postage\nstamp](/wiki/Postage_stamp \"Postage stamp\") of 1936\n\nDuring Austin's time in Arkansas, his father traveled to [Spanish\nTexas](/wiki/Spanish_Texas \"Spanish Texas\") and received an\n[empresarial](/wiki/Empresario \"Empresario\") grant that would allow him to\nbring 300 American families to Texas,[6] they would be called \"[The Old\n300](/wiki/Old_Three_Hundred \"Old Three Hundred\").\" Moses Austin caught\npneumonia soon after returning to Missouri.[6] He directed that his\n_empresario_ grant would be taken over by his son Stephen.\n\nAlthough Austin was reluctant to carry on his father's Texas venture, he was\npersuaded to pursue the colonization of Texas by a letter from his mother,\n[Mary Brown Austin](/wiki/Mary_Brown_Austin \"Mary Brown Austin\"), written two\ndays before Moses Austin would die.[9] Austin boarded the steamer, _Beaver_ ,\nand departed to New Orleans to meet Spanish officials led by [Erasmo\nSeguín](/wiki/Erasmo_Segu%C3%ADn \"Erasmo Seguín\"). He was at [Natchitoches,\nLouisiana](/wiki/Natchitoches,_Louisiana \"Natchitoches, Louisiana\"), on June\n31, 1821, when he learned of his father's death. \"This news has effected me\nvery much, he was one of the most feeling and affectionate Fathers that ever\nlived. His faults I now say, and always have, were not of the heart.\"[10]\n\nAt the age of 24, Austin led his party to travel 300 miles (480 km) in four\nweeks to [San Antonio](/wiki/San_Antonio \"San Antonio\") with the intent of\nreauthorizing his father's grant, arriving on August 12. While in transit,\nthey learned Mexico had declared its independence from Spain, and Texas had\nbecome a Mexican province, rather than a Spanish territory. [José Antonio\nNavarro](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Antonio_Navarro \"José Antonio Navarro\"), a San\nAntonio native with ambitious visions of the future of Texas, befriended\nStephen F. Austin, and the two developed a lasting association. Navarro,\nproficient in Spanish and Mexican law, assisted Austin in obtaining his\nempresario contracts.[11] In San Antonio, the grant was reauthorized by\nGovernor [Antonio María Martínez](/wiki/Antonio_Mar%C3%ADa_Mart%C3%ADnez\n\"Antonio María Martínez\"), who allowed Austin to explore the [Gulf\nCoast](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of Mexico\") between [San\nAntonio](/wiki/San_Antonio \"San Antonio\") and the [Brazos\nRiver](/wiki/Brazos_River \"Brazos River\") to find a suitable location for a\ncolony.[8] As guides for the party, [Manuel Becerra](/wiki/Manuel_Becerra\n\"Manuel Becerra\") and three [Aranama](/wiki/Aranama \"Aranama\") Indians, went\nwith the expedition.\n\nAustin advertised the Texas opportunity in [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans\n\"New Orleans\"), announcing that land was available along the\n[Brazos](/wiki/Brazos_River \"Brazos River\") and\n[Colorado](/wiki/Colorado_River_\\(Texas\\) \"Colorado River \\(Texas\\)\")\nrivers.[12] A family of a husband, wife, and two children would receive 1,280\nacres (520 ha) at twelve and a half cents per acre. Farmers could get 177\nacres (72 ha), and ranchers 4,428 acres (1,792 ha). In December 1821, the\nfirst U.S. colonists crossed into the granted territory by land and sea, on\nthe Brazos River in present-day [Brazoria County,\nTexas](/wiki/Brazoria_County,_Texas \"Brazoria County, Texas\").\n\n## Empresario Austin\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Stephen_Austin_and_dog.jpg/220px-\nStephen_Austin_and_dog.jpg)](/wiki/File:Stephen_Austin_and_dog.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Stephen_Austin_and_dog.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStephen F. Austin was an important figure in early Texas\n\nAustin's plan for an American colony was thrown into turmoil by Mexico's\ngaining [independence from Spain](/wiki/Treaty_of_C%C3%B3rdoba \"Treaty of\nCórdoba\") in 1821. Governor Martínez informed Austin that the _junta\ninstituyente_ , the new [rump congress](/wiki/Rump_legislature \"Rump\nlegislature\") of the government of [Agustín de\nIturbide](/wiki/Agust%C3%ADn_de_Iturbide \"Agustín de Iturbide\") of Mexico,\nrefused to recognize the [land grant](/wiki/Land_grant \"Land grant\")\nauthorized by Spain. His government intended to use a general [immigration\nlaw](/wiki/Immigration_law \"Immigration law\") to regulate new settlement in\nMexico. Austin traveled to [Mexico City](/wiki/Mexico_City \"Mexico City\"),\nwhere he persuaded the _junta instituyente_ to approve the grant to his\nfather, as well as the law signed by the Mexican Emperor on January 3, 1823.\n\nThe old imperial law offered heads of families a league and a labor of land,\n4,605 acres (1,864 ha), and other inducements. It also provided for the\nemployment of agents, called _[empresarios](/wiki/Empresario \"Empresario\")_ ,\nto promote [immigration](/wiki/Immigration \"Immigration\"). As an _empresario_\n, Austin was to receive 67,000 acres of land for each 200 families he brought\nto Texas. According to the law, immigrants were not required to pay fees to\nthe government. Some of the immigrants denied Austin's right to charge them\nfor services at the rate of 12.5 cents/acre (31 cents/ha).[13]\n\nWhen the Emperor of Mexico,[14] [Agustín de\nIturbide](/wiki/Agust%C3%ADn_de_Iturbide \"Agustín de Iturbide\"), abdicated in\nMarch 1823, the law was annulled once again. In April 1823, Austin induced the\ncongress to grant him a contract to bring 300 families into Texas. He wanted\nhonest, hard-working people who would make the colony a success. In 1824, the\ncongress passed a [new immigration law](/wiki/General_Colonization_Law\n\"General Colonization Law\") that allowed the individual states of Mexico to\nadminister public lands and open them to settlement under certain conditions.\nIn March 1825, the legislature of the Mexican state of [Coahuila y\nTejas](/wiki/Coahuila_y_Tejas \"Coahuila y Tejas\") passed a law similar to the\none authorized by Iturbide. The law continued the system of _empresarios_ , as\nwell as granting each married man a league of land, 4,428 acres (1,792 ha),\nwith the stipulation that he must pay the state $30 within six years.\n\nBy late 1825, Austin had brought the first 300 families to his settlement, the\nAustin Colony; these 300 are now known in [Texas\nhistory](/wiki/History_of_Texas \"History of Texas\") as the [Old Three\nHundred](/wiki/Old_Three_Hundred \"Old Three Hundred\"). Austin had obtained\nfurther contracts to settle an additional 900 families between 1825 and 1829.\nHe had effective civil and military authority over the\n[settlers](/wiki/Settlers \"Settlers\"), but he was quick to introduce a\nsemblance of American law - the Constitution of Coahuila y Tejas was agreed on\nin November 1827. Also, Austin organized small, informal armed groups to\nprotect the colonists, which evolved into the [Texas\nRangers](/wiki/Texas_Rangers_Division \"Texas Rangers Division\"). Despite his\nhopes, Austin was making little money from his endeavors; the colonists were\nunwilling to pay for his services as _empresario_ and most of his revenues\nwere spent on the processes of government and other public services.\n\nDuring these years, Austin, a member of Louisiana Lodge No. 111 at [Ste.\nGenevieve, Missouri](/wiki/Ste._Genevieve,_Missouri \"Ste. Genevieve,\nMissouri\"), sought to establish [Freemasonry](/wiki/Freemasonry \"Freemasonry\")\nin Texas. Freemasonry was well established among the educated classes of\nMexican society. It had been introduced among the aristocracy loyal to the\n[House of Bourbon](/wiki/House_of_Bourbon \"House of Bourbon\"), and the\nconservatives had total control over the Order. By 1827, Americans living in\n[Mexico City](/wiki/Mexico_City \"Mexico City\") had introduced the United\nStates [York Rite](/wiki/York_Rite \"York Rite\") of Freemasonry as a liberal\nalternative to the established European-style [Scottish\nRite](/wiki/Scottish_Rite \"Scottish Rite\").[15]\n\nOn February 11, 1828, Austin called a meeting of Freemasons at [San\nFelipe](/wiki/San_Felipe,_Texas \"San Felipe, Texas\") to elect officers and to\npetition the Masonic [Grand Lodge](/wiki/Grand_Lodge \"Grand Lodge\") in Mexico\nCity for a charter to form a lodge. Austin was elected [Worshipful\nMaster](/wiki/Worshipful_Master \"Worshipful Master\") of the new lodge.\nAlthough the petition reached [Matamoros](/wiki/Matamoros,_Tamaulipas\n\"Matamoros, Tamaulipas\"), and was to be forwarded to Mexico City, nothing more\nwas heard of it. By 1828, the ruling faction in Mexico was afraid the liberal\nelements in Texas might try to gain their independence. Fully aware of the\npolitical philosophies of American Freemasons, the [Mexican\ngovernment](/wiki/Mexican_government \"Mexican government\") outlawed\nFreemasonry on October 25, 1828. In 1829, Austin called another meeting, where\nit was decided that it was \"impolitic and imprudent, at this time, to form\nMasonic lodges in Texas.\"[16]\n\nHe was active in promoting trade and currying the good favor of the Mexican\nauthorities, aiding them in the suppression of the [Fredonian\nRebellion](/wiki/Republic_of_Fredonia \"Republic of Fredonia\") of [Haden\nEdwards](/wiki/Haden_Edwards \"Haden Edwards\"). Some historians consider the\nFredonian Rebellion to be the beginning of the [Texas\nRevolution](/wiki/Texas_Revolution \"Texas Revolution\"). Although \"premature\n... the Fredonian Rebellion sparked the powder for later success.\"[17] For\nthis event, Austin raised troops to fight with Mexican troops against the\nTexas rebels. With the colonists numbering more than 11,000 by 1832, they were\nbecoming less amenable to Austin's cautious leadership, and also, the Mexican\ngovernment was becoming less cooperative. It was concerned with the growth of\nthe colony and the efforts of the U.S. government to buy the state from them.\nThe Mexican government had attempted to stop further U.S. immigration as early\nas April 1830, but Austin's skills gained an exemption for his colonies. He\ngranted land to immigrants based on 640 acres (2.6 km2) to the husband, 320 to\nthe wife, 160 for every child, and 80 for every slave.\n\n## Slavery\n\nSlavery was a very important issue to Austin, one he called \"of great\ninterest\" to him.[18] Austin was a periodical slaveowner throughout his life;\nhowever, he had conflicting views about it.[19][20][21][22] Theoretically, he\nbelieved slavery was wrong and went against the American ideal of liberty. In\npractice, however, he agreed with the social, economic, and political\njustifications of it, and worked hard to defend and expand it.[23] Despite his\ndefense of it, he also harbored concerns that the long-term effects of slavery\nwould destroy American society. He grew particularly concerned following [Nat\nTurner](/wiki/Nat_Turner \"Nat Turner\")'s rebellion, stating:\n\n> _\" I sometimes shudder at the consequences and think that a large part of\n> America will be Santo Domingonized in 100, or 200 years. The idea of seeing\n> such a country as this overrun by a slave population almost makes me weep.\n> It is in vain to tell a North American that the white population will be\n> destroyed some fifty or eighty years hence by the negroes, and that his\n> daughters will be violated and Butchered by them.[24][25][26]\"_\n\nWhile Austin thought it would be advantageous some day for Texas to phase out\nof slavery, up until the [Texas Revolution](/wiki/Texas_Revolution \"Texas\nRevolution\"), he worked to ensure that his colony's immigrants could bypass\nthe Mexican government's resistance to it.[27] Doing so ensured the population\ngrowth and economic development of his colony, which was primarily dependent\non the [monocropping](/wiki/Monocropping \"Monocropping\") of\n[cotton](/wiki/Cotton#United_States \"Cotton\") and sugar.[28][29][30]\n\nArguing that the loss of slaves would be ruinous to the colony, he arranged\nfor his settlers to receive eighty acres of land for each slave they brought\nwith them to Texas. In August 1825, he recommended that the state government\nallow immigrants to bring their slaves with them through 1840, with the caveat\nthat female grandchildren of the slaves would be freed by the age of 15, and\nmales by age of 25.[31][32][33] His recommendation was rejected.\n\nIn 1826, when a state committee proposed abolishing slavery outright, 25\npercent of the people in Austin's colony were slaves.[34][35] Austin's\ncolonists, mostly pro-slavery immigrants from the south, threatened to leave\nTexas if the proposition passed, while prospective Southern immigrants\nhesitated to come to Texas until slavery was guaranteed there.[33]\n\nAustin conceded that the success of his colony was dependent on\nslavery.[19][33][36] Without slaves, the colonists would lack the mass labor\nto cultivate the land, which would stall the pace of immigration needed to\ndevelop and increase the value of the land, which would deflate the economy\nand motivate his colonists to leave.[33][37][38]\n\nAustin went before the legislature and pleaded that, at the least; his\noriginal 300 colonists should be allowed to keep their slaves.[33] He argued\nagainst the \"bad faith\" of freeing them, demanded\n[reparations](/wiki/Reparations_\\(transitional_justice\\) \"Reparations\n\\(transitional justice\\)\") to slaveowners for every slave emancipated by the\nstate, warned that the loss of slaves could leave some colonists destitute,\nand reasoned that freeing them would not only leave his settlers alone in the\nharsh Texas environment, but would also expose them to the discomfort and\nnuisance of living amongst freed slaves, who would become vagrants seeking\nretribution upon their former owners.[39] While he waited for the\nlegislature's verdict of his request, Austin went into a deep depression over\nthe issue and sent his brother, [Brown Austin](/wiki/James_E.B._Austin \"James\nE.B. Austin\"), to further lobby the legislature on his behalf.[40][41]\n\nIn March of 1827, the legislature signed [Article\n13](/wiki/Coahuila_y_Tejas#Immigration_and_slavery \"Coahuila y Tejas\") into\nlaw. Despite the law complying with some of his requests, Austin called it\n\"unconstitutional.\" He contested the law as it freed the children of slaves at\nbirth, established a six-month grace period before fully emancipating all\nslaves in the state, and included provisions to improve the conditions of\nslaves and transitioning freedmen.[42][43][44][45] Austin –– who had been so\neffective in persuading the legislature, however, that the author of Article\n13 (before its passage) requested to withdraw it –– helped his colonists evade\nthe law by advising them to legally supplant the word \"slave\" with the words\n\"workingmen,\" \"family servants,\" and \"laborers,\" and by working to pass a\ndecree that banned [freedmen](/wiki/Freedmen \"Freedmen\") from Texas and forced\nemancipated slaves to work for their former slaveowners until the accrued\n\"debt\" (e.g. clothing, food), incurred for their own enslavement, was worked\noff.[26][44][46]\n\nIn 1828, Austin petitioned the legislature to guarantee that slaveowners,\nimmigrating to Texas, could legally \"free\" their slaves before immigrating,\nand contract them into a lifetime term of indentured servitude, thereby\navoiding recognizing them as slaves.[47] He lobbied to help his colony elude\n[Vicente Guerrero](/wiki/Vicente_Guerrero \"Vicente Guerrero\")'s 1829 attempt\nto legally emancipate slaves in the province, and to bypass the government's\neffort to prohibit slavery when it passed the [Law of April 6,\n1830](/wiki/Law_of_April_6,_1830 \"Law of April 6, 1830\").[30][48][49] In 1830,\nAustin wrote that he would oppose Texas joining the United States without\nguarantees that he should \"insist on the perpetual exclusion of slavery from\nthis state [Texas].\"[49] In 1833, he wrote:\n\n> _\" Texas must be a slave country. Circumstances and unavoidable necessity\n> compel it. It is the wish of the people there, and it is my duty to do all I\n> can, prudently, in favor of it. I will do so.[33]\"_\n\nIn May 1835, Austin's colonists learned that Mexico's tolerance for the\nevasions of slaveowners was drawing to a close, with its proposal of new\nabolition legislation.[26] Alarmed, and with Austin imprisoned in Mexico for\npushing for independence, colonists turned against the Mexican government,\ncalling it \"oppressive\" and a \"plundering, robbing, autocratical government\"\nwithout regard for the security of \"life, liberty or property.\"[26][50]\nResisting the impact a changed slavery policy would have on economic growth,\nand fearing rumors of Mexico's plan to free the slaves and turn them loose\nupon the colonists, shortly after Austin returned from Mexico, he and his\ncolonists took up arms against the Mexican government. Austin later gained\nU.S. Government support for his revolution when he wrote to Senator [Lewis F.\nLinn](/wiki/Lewis_F._Linn \"Lewis F. Linn\") and pleaded that [Santa\nAnna](/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna \"Antonio López de Santa Anna\")\nplanned to \"exterminate\" all of the colonists and fill Texas \"with Indians and\nnegroes [freed slaves].\"[26][51][52]\n\n## Relations with Mexico\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/da/Stephen_F._Austin_at_the_Texas_State_Capitol.jpg/220px-\nStephen_F._Austin_at_the_Texas_State_Capitol.jpg)](/wiki/File:Stephen_F._Austin_at_the_Texas_State_Capitol.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Stephen_F._Austin_at_the_Texas_State_Capitol.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMarble sculpture of Stephen F. Austin (1903) by [Elisabet\nNey](/wiki/Elisabet_Ney \"Elisabet Ney\") at the Texas State Capitol\n\nThe application off the immigration control of the introduction of\n[tariff](/wiki/Tariff \"Tariff\") laws had done much to dissatisfy the\ncolonists, peaking in the [Anahuac Disturbances](/wiki/Anahuac_Disturbances\n\"Anahuac Disturbances\"). Austin became involved in Mexican politics,\nsupporting the upstart [Antonio López de Santa\nAnna](/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna \"Antonio López de Santa Anna\").\nFollowing the success of Santa Anna, the colonists sought a compensatory\nreward, proclaimed at the [Convention of 1832](/wiki/Convention_of_1832\n\"Convention of 1832\")—resumption of immigration, tariff exemption, separation\nfrom Coahuila, and a new state government for Texas. Austin did not support\nthese demands; he considered them ill-timed and tried his hardest to moderate\nthem. When they were repeated and extended at the [Convention of\n1833](/wiki/Convention_of_1833 \"Convention of 1833\"), Austin traveled to\n[Mexico City](/wiki/Mexico_City \"Mexico City\") on July 18, 1833, and met with\nVice President [Valentín Gomez Farías](/wiki/Valent%C3%ADn_Gomez_Far%C3%ADas\n\"Valentín Gomez Farías\"). Austin did gain certain important reforms; the\nimmigration ban was lifted, but a separate state government was not\nauthorized. Statehood in Mexico required a population of 80,000, and Texas had\nonly 30,000.\n\nBelieving that he was pushing for Texas independence and suspect that he was\ntrying to incite insurrection, Austin was arrested by the Mexican government\nin January 1834 in [Saltillo](/wiki/Saltillo \"Saltillo\"),\n[Coahuila](/wiki/Coahuila \"Coahuila\"), [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\"). He was\ntaken to [Mexico City](/wiki/Mexico_City \"Mexico City\") and imprisoned. No\ncharges were filed against him as no court would take jurisdiction. He was\nmoved from prison to prison. He was released under bond in December 1834 and\nrequired to stay in the [Federal District](/wiki/Federal_District \"Federal\nDistrict\"). He was fully freed under the general amnesty in July 1835 and in\nAugust 1835 left Mexico to return to Texas via [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans\n\"New Orleans\").\n\n## Texas Revolution\n\nMain article: [Texas Revolution](/wiki/Texas_Revolution \"Texas Revolution\")\n\nIn his absence, a number of events propelled the colonists toward\nconfrontation with Santa Anna's centralist government. Austin took temporary\ncommand of the Texan forces during the [Siege of\nBéxar](/wiki/Siege_of_B%C3%A9xar \"Siege of Béxar\") from October 12 to December\n11, 1835. After learning of the [Disturbances at\nAnahuac](/wiki/Anahuac_Disturbances \"Anahuac Disturbances\") and Velasco in the\nsummer of 1835, an enraged Santa Anna made rapid preparations for the Mexican\narmy to sweep Anglo settlers from Texas. War began in October 1835 at\n[Gonzales](/wiki/Gonzales,_Texas \"Gonzales, Texas\"). The [Republic of\nTexas](/wiki/Republic_of_Texas \"Republic of Texas\"), created by a new\nconstitution on March 2, 1836, won independence following a string of defeats\nwith the dramatic turnabout victory at the [Battle of San\nJacinto](/wiki/Battle_of_San_Jacinto \"Battle of San Jacinto\") on April 21,\n1836, and the capture of Santa Anna the following morning. He was then\nimprisoned.\n\n## Austin in the Republic of Texas\n\nFurther information: [Republic of Texas](/wiki/Republic_of_Texas \"Republic of\nTexas\")\n\nIn December 1835, Austin, Branch Archer, and [William H.\nWharton](/wiki/William_H._Wharton \"William H. Wharton\") were appointed\ncommissioners to the U.S. by the provisional government of the republic. On\nJune 10, 1836, Austin was in New Orleans, where he received word of Santa\nAnna's defeat by [Sam Houston](/wiki/Sam_Houston \"Sam Houston\") at the [Battle\nof San Jacinto](/wiki/Battle_of_San_Jacinto \"Battle of San Jacinto\"). Austin\nreturned to Texas to rest at Peach Point in August. On August 4, he announced\nhis candidacy for president of Texas. Austin felt confident he could win the\nelection until two weeks before the election, when on August 20, Houston\nentered the race. Austin wrote, \"Many of the old settlers who are too blind to\nsee or understand their interest will vote for him.\" Houston carried East\nTexas, the Red River region, and most of the soldiers' votes. Austin received\n587 votes to [Sam Houston](/wiki/Sam_Houston \"Sam Houston\")'s 5,119 and [Henry\nSmith](/wiki/Henry_Smith_\\(Texas_Governor\\) \"Henry Smith \\(Texas\nGovernor\\)\")'s 743 votes.\n\nHouston would appoint Austin as the first secretary of state of the new\nrepublic; however, Austin only served approximately two months before his\ndeath.\n\n## Death and estate\n\nIn December 1836, Austin was in the new capital of Columbia (now known as\n[West Columbia](/wiki/West_Columbia,_Texas \"West Columbia, Texas\")) where he\ncaught a severe cold; his condition worsened. Doctors were called in, but\ncould not help him. Austin died of [pneumonia](/wiki/Pneumonia \"Pneumonia\") at\nnoon on December 27, 1836. He was at the home of George B. McKinstry, near\nwhat is now West Columbia, Texas. He was 43. Austin's last words were \"The\nindependence of Texas is recognized! Don't you see it in the papers?...\" Upon\nhearing of Austin's death, Houston ordered an official statement proclaiming:\n\"The Father of Texas is no more; the first pioneer of the wilderness has\ndeparted.\" Originally, Austin was buried at [Gulf Prairie\nCemetery](/wiki/Gulf_Prairie_Cemetery \"Gulf Prairie Cemetery\") in [Brazoria\nCounty, Texas](/wiki/Brazoria_County,_Texas \"Brazoria County, Texas\"). In 1910\nAustin's body was reinterred at the [Texas State\nCemetery](/wiki/Texas_State_Cemetery \"Texas State Cemetery\") in\n[Austin](/wiki/Austin,_Texas \"Austin, Texas\").\n\nAustin never married, nor did he have any children. He bequeathed all his\nland, titles, and possessions, to his married sister, [Emily Austin\nPerry](/wiki/Emily_Austin_Perry \"Emily Austin Perry\").\n\n## Monuments\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/AustinStateOfficeBuildingAustinTX.JPG/200px-\nAustinStateOfficeBuildingAustinTX.JPG)](/wiki/File:AustinStateOfficeBuildingAustinTX.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AustinStateOfficeBuildingAustinTX.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nStephen F.
