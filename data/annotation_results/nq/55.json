Percy\nFawcett's [India](/wiki/India \"India\")-born father was a Fellow of the [Royal\nGeographical Society](/wiki/Royal_Geographical_Society \"Royal Geographical\nSociety\") (RGS). His elder brother [Edward Douglas\nFawcett](/w/index.php?title=Edward_Douglas_Fawcett&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Edward Douglas Fawcett \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1866–1960) was a mountain\nclimber, Eastern occultist and author of philosophical books and popular\n[adventure novels](/wiki/Adventure_fiction \"Adventure fiction\").[3]\n\nFawcett attended the [Royal Military Academy,\nWoolwich](/wiki/Royal_Military_Academy,_Woolwich \"Royal Military Academy,\nWoolwich\") as a cadet, being commissioned as a lieutenant of the [Royal\nArtillery](/wiki/Royal_Artillery \"Royal Artillery\") on 24 July 1886.[4] On 13\nJanuary 1896 he was appointed [adjutant](/wiki/Adjutant \"Adjutant\")[5] of the\n[1st Cornwall (Duke of Cornwall's) Artillery\nVolunteers](/wiki/1st_Cornwall_\\(Duke_of_Cornwall%27s\\)_Artillery_Volunteers\n\"1st Cornwall \\(Duke of Cornwall's\\) Artillery Volunteers\"),[6] and was\npromoted to captain on 15 June 1897.[7] He later served in\n[Trincomalee](/wiki/Trincomalee \"Trincomalee\"), [Ceylon](/wiki/Sri_Lanka \"Sri\nLanka\"), where he also met his future wife Nina Agnes Paterson, whom he\nmarried in January 1901 after having previously ended their engagement. They\nhad two sons, Jack (born 1903) and Brian (1906–1984), and one daughter, Joan\n(1910–2005). He joined the RGS himself in 1901 in order to study surveying and\nmapmaking. Later, he worked for the [British Secret\nService](/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service \"Secret Intelligence Service\") in\n[North Africa](/wiki/North_Africa \"North Africa\") while pursuing the\nsurveyor's craft. He served for the war office on [Spike Island, County\nCork](/wiki/Spike_Island,_County_Cork \"Spike Island, County Cork\") from 1903\nto 1906, where he was promoted to major on 11 January 1905.[8] He became\nfriends with authors [H. Rider Haggard](/wiki/H._Rider_Haggard \"H. Rider\nHaggard\") and [Arthur Conan Doyle](/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle \"Arthur Conan\nDoyle\"); the latter used Fawcett's [Amazonian](/wiki/Amazon_basin \"Amazon\nbasin\") field reports as an inspiration for his novel _[The Lost\nWorld](/wiki/The_Lost_World_\\(Conan_Doyle_novel\\) \"The Lost World \\(Conan\nDoyle novel\\)\")_.\n\n### Early\nexpeditions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Early expeditions\")]\n\nFawcett's first expedition to South America was in 1906 (being seconded for\nservice there on 2 May[9]) when at the age of 39 he travelled to Brazil to map\na jungle area at the border of Brazil and Bolivia at the behest of the Royal\nGeographical Society. The Society had been commissioned to map the area as a\nthird party unbiased by local [national interests](/wiki/Nationalism\n\"Nationalism\"). He arrived in [La Paz](/wiki/La_Paz \"La Paz\"),\n[Bolivia](/wiki/Bolivia \"Bolivia\") in June. Whilst on the expedition in 1907,\nFawcett claimed to have seen and shot a 62 foot long [giant\nanaconda](/wiki/Giant_anaconda \"Giant anaconda\"), a claim for which he was\nridiculed by scientists. He reported other mysterious animals unknown to\nzoology, such as a small [cat-like dog](/wiki/Mitla_\\(cryptid\\) \"Mitla\n\\(cryptid\\)\") about the size of a [foxhound](/wiki/Foxhound \"Foxhound\"), which\nhe claimed to have seen twice, or the giant Apazauca spider which was said to\nhave poisoned a number of locals.[10][11]\n\nFawcett made seven expeditions between 1906 and 1924. He was mostly amicable\nwith the locals through gifts, patience and courteous behaviour. In 1908, he\ntraced the source of the [Rio Verde](/wiki/Verde_River_\\(Guapor%C3%A9_River\\)\n\"Verde River \\(Guaporé River\\)\") (Brazil) and in 1910 made a journey to [Heath\nRiver](/wiki/Heath_River \"Heath River\") (on the border between\n[Peru](/wiki/Peru \"Peru\") and Bolivia) to find its source, having retired from\nthe British army on 19 January.[12] After a 1913 expedition, he supposedly\nclaimed to have seen dogs with double noses. These may have been [Double-nosed\nAndean tiger hounds](/wiki/Double-nosed_Andean_tiger_hound \"Double-nosed\nAndean tiger hound\").[13]\n\nBased on documentary research, Fawcett had by 1914 formulated ideas about a\n\"lost city\" he named \"Z\" somewhere in the [Mato Grosso](/wiki/Mato_Grosso\n\"Mato Grosso\") region of Brazil. He theorized that a complex civilization once\nexisted in the Amazon region and that isolated ruins may have survived.[14]\nFawcett also found a document known as [Manuscript 512](/wiki/Manuscript_512\n\"Manuscript 512\") ([pt](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscrito_512\n\"pt:Manuscrito 512\")), written after explorations made in the\n[sertão](/wiki/Sert%C3%A3o \"Sertão\") of the state of [Bahia](/wiki/Bahia\n\"Bahia\"), and housed at the National Library of [Rio de\nJaneiro](/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro \"Rio de Janeiro\"). It is believed to be by\nPortuguese [bandeirante](/wiki/Bandeirante \"Bandeirante\") [João da Silva\nGuimarães](/w/index.php?title=Jo%C3%A3o_da_Silva_Guimar%C3%A3es&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"João da Silva Guimarães \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n([pt](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_da_Silva_Guimar%C3%A3es \"pt:João\nda Silva Guimarães\")), who wrote that in 1753 he'd discovered the ruins of an\nancient city that contained arches, a statue, and a temple with hieroglyphics;\nthe city is described in great detail without providing a specific location.\nThis city became a secondary destination for Fawcett, after \"Z\". (See\nFawcett's own book _Exploration Fawcett_.)\n\nAt the beginning of the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War \"First World\nWar\") Fawcett returned to Britain to serve with the Army as a Reserve Officer\nin the Royal Artillery, volunteering for duty in [Flanders](/wiki/Flanders\n\"Flanders\"), and commanding an [artillery brigade](/wiki/Artillery_brigade\n\"Artillery brigade\") despite the fact that he was nearly fifty years of age.\nHe was promoted from major to lieutenant-colonel on 1 March 1918,[15] and\nreceived three [mentions in despatches](/wiki/Mentions_in_despatches \"Mentions\nin despatches\") from [Douglas Haig](/wiki/Douglas_Haig,_1st_Earl_Haig \"Douglas\nHaig, 1st Earl Haig\"), in November 1916,[16] November 1917,[17] and November\n1918,[18] and was also awarded the [Distinguished Service\nOrder](/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Order \"Distinguished Service Order\") in\nJune 1917.[19]\n\nAfter the war Fawcett returned to Brazil to study local wildlife and\n[archaeology](/wiki/Archaeology \"Archaeology\"). In 1920, he made a solo\nattempt to search for \"Z\", but ended after suffering from a fever and shooting\nhis pack animal.[14]\n\n### Final\nexpedition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Final expedition\")]\n\nIn 1925, with funding from a London-based group of financiers known as the\nGlove,[20] Fawcett returned to Brazil with his eldest son Jack and Jack's best\nand longtime friend, Raleigh Rimell, for an exploratory expedition to find\n\"Z\". Fawcett left instructions stating that if the expedition did not return,\nno rescue expedition should be sent lest the rescuers suffer his fate.\n\nFawcett was a man with years of experience travelling, and had brought\nequipment such as canned foods, powdered milk, guns, flares, a\n[sextant](/wiki/Sextant \"Sextant\"), and a\n[chronometer](/wiki/Marine_chronometer \"Marine chronometer\"). His travel\ncompanions were both chosen for their health, ability and loyalty to each\nother; Fawcett chose only two companions in order to travel lighter and with\nless notice to native tribes, as some were hostile towards outsiders.\n\nOn 20 April 1925 his final expedition departed from [Cuiabá](/wiki/Cuiab%C3%A1\n\"Cuiabá\"). In addition to his two principal companions, Fawcett was\naccompanied by two Brazilian labourers, two horses, eight mules, and a pair of\ndogs. The last communication from the expedition was on 29 May 1925 when\nFawcett wrote, in a letter to his wife delivered by a native runner, that he\nwas ready to go into unexplored territory with only Jack and Raleigh. They\nwere reported to be crossing the [Upper Xingu](/wiki/Xingu_River \"Xingu\nRiver\"), a [southeastern](/wiki/Ordinal_directions \"Ordinal directions\")\n[tributary](/wiki/Tributary \"Tributary\") river of the [River\nAmazon](/wiki/Amazon_River \"Amazon River\"). The final letter, written from\n[Dead Horse Camp](/wiki/Dead_Horse_Camp \"Dead Horse Camp\"), gave their\nlocation and was generally optimistic.\n\nMany people assumed that local [Indians](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Brazil\n\"Indigenous peoples in Brazil\") killed them, as several tribes were nearby at\nthe time: the [Kalapalos](/wiki/Kalapalo \"Kalapalo\"), the last tribe to have\nseen them, the Arumás, [Suyás](/wiki/Suy%C3%A1 \"Suyá\"), and the\n[Xavantes](/wiki/Xavante_people \"Xavante people\") whose territory they were\nentering. The Kalapalo have an oral story of the arrival of three explorers\nwhich states that the three went east, and after five days the Kalapalo\nnoticed that the group no longer made camp fires. The Kalapalo say that a very\nviolent tribe most likely killed them. However, both of the younger men were\nlame and ill when last seen, and there is not any proof that they were\nmurdered. It is plausible that they died of natural causes in the Brazilian\njungle.\n\nIn 1927, a name-plate of Fawcett was found with an Indian tribe. In June 1933,\na [theodolite](/wiki/Theodolite \"Theodolite\") compass belonging to Fawcett was\nfound near the Baciary Indians of [Mato Grosso](/wiki/Mato_Grosso \"Mato\nGrosso\") by Colonel Aniceto Botelho. However, the name-plate was from\nFawcett's expedition five years earlier and had most likely been given as a\ngift to the chief of that Indian tribe. The compass was proved to have been\nleft behind before he entered the jungle on his final journey.[21][22][23]\n\n#### Dead Horse\nCamp[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Dead Horse Camp\")]\n\n**Dead Horse Camp** , or **Fawcett’s camp** , is one of the major camps that\nFawcett made on his final journey. This encampment was his last known\nlocation.[24]\n\nFrom Dead Horse Camp, Fawcett wrote to his wife about the hardships that he\nand his companions had faced, his coordinates, his doubts in Raleigh Rimmel,\nand of his plans for the near future. He concludes his message with, “You need\nhave no fear of any failure...”[24]\n\nOne question remaining about Dead Horse Camp concerns a discrepancy in the\ncoordinates Fawcett gave for the camp. In the letter to his wife, he wrote:\n\"Here we are at Dead Horse Camp, latitude 11 degrees 43' South and longitude\n54 degrees 35' West, the spot where my horse died in 1920\" ([11°43′S 54°35′W﻿\n/ ﻿11.717°S 54.583°W﻿ / -11.717;\n-54.583](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Percy_Fawcett&params=11_43_S_54_35_W_)).\nHowever, in a report to the [North American Newspaper\nAlliance](/wiki/North_American_Newspaper_Alliance \"North American Newspaper\nAlliance\") he gave the coordinates as [13°43′S 54°35′W﻿ / ﻿13.717°S 54.583°W﻿\n/ -13.717;\n-54.583](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Percy_Fawcett&params=13_43_S_54_35_W_).[25]\n\nThe discrepancy may have been a [typographical](/wiki/Typographical\n\"Typographical\") error. However, he may have intentionally concealed the\nlocation to prevent others from using his notes to find the lost city.[26] It\nmay have also been an attempt to dissuade any rescue attempts; Fawcett had\nstated that if he disappeared, no [rescue party](/wiki/Search_and_rescue\n\"Search and rescue\") should be sent because the danger was too great.[25]\n\n## Posthumous controversy and\nspeculations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Posthumous controversy and speculations\")]\n\n### Rumours and unverified\nreports[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Rumours and unverified reports\")]\n\nDuring the ensuing decades, various groups mounted several rescue expeditions,\nwithout success. They heard only various rumours that could not be verified.\nIn addition to reports that Fawcett had been killed by Indians or wild\nanimals, there was a tale that Fawcett had [lost his memory](/wiki/Amnesia\n\"Amnesia\") and lived out his life as the chief of a tribe of\n[cannibals](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\").\n\nWhile a fictitious tale estimated that 100 would-be-rescuers died on several\nexpeditions attempting to discover Fawcett's fate[27], the actual toll was\nonly one - a sole man who ventured after him alone.[28] One of the earliest\nexpeditions was commanded by American explorer [George Miller\nDyott](/wiki/George_Miller_Dyott \"George Miller Dyott\"). In 1927 he claimed to\nhave found evidence of Fawcett's death at the hands of the\n[Aloique](/w/index.php?title=Aloique&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Aloique \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") Indians, but his story was unconvincing. From 1930–31,\n[Aloha Wanderwell](/wiki/Aloha_Wanderwell#Brazil \"Aloha Wanderwell\") used her\nseaplane to try to land on the Amazon River in the Matto Grosso to find him.\nAfter an emergency landing and living with the Bororo Tribe for 6 weeks, Aloha\nand Walter Flew back to Brazil, with no luck. A 1951 expedition unearthed\nhuman bones that were found later to be unrelated to Fawcett or his\ncompanions.\n\n### Villas-Bôas\nstory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Villas-Bôas story\")]\n\nDanish explorer [Arne Falk-Rønne](/wiki/Arne_Falk-R%C3%B8nne \"Arne Falk-\nRønne\") journeyed to the [Mato Grosso](/wiki/Mato_Grosso \"Mato Grosso\") during\nthe 1960s. In a 1991 book, he wrote that he learned of Fawcett's fate from\n[Orlando Villas-Bôas](/wiki/Villas-B%C3%B4as_brothers \"Villas-Bôas\nbrothers\")[29], who had heard it from one of Fawcett's murderers. Allegedly,\nFawcett and his companions had a mishap on the river and lost most of the\ngifts they'd brought along for the Indian tribes. Continuing without gifts was\na serious breach of protocol; since the expedition members were all more or\nless seriously ill at the time, the Kalapalo tribe they encountered decided to\nkill them. The bodies of Jack Fawcett and Raleigh Rimell were thrown into the\nriver; Colonel Fawcett, considered an old man and therefore distinguished,\nreceived a proper burial. Falk-Rønne visited the Kalapalo tribe and reported\nthat one of the tribesmen confirmed Villas-Bôas's story about how and why\nFawcett had been killed.\n\n### Fawcett's\nBones[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Fawcett's Bones\")]\n\nIn 1951, [Orlando Villas-Bôas](/wiki/Villas-B%C3%B4as_brothers \"Villas-Bôas\nbrothers\"), activist for indigenous peoples, supposedly received the actual\nremaining skeletal bones of Fawcett and had them analysed scientifically. The\nanalysis allegedly confirmed the bones to be Fawcett's, but his son Brian\nFawcett (1906–1984) refused to accept this. Villas-Bôas claimed that Brian was\ntoo interested in making money from books about his father's disappearance.\nLater scientific analysis confirmed that the bones were not Fawcett's.[30] As\nof 1965, the bones reportedly rested in a box in the flat of one of the\nVillas-Bôas brothers in [São Paulo](/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo \"São Paulo\").[31]\n\nIn 1998, English explorer [Benedict Allen](/wiki/Benedict_Allen \"Benedict\nAllen\") went to talk to the Kalapalo Indians, said by Villas-Bôas to have\nconfessed to having killed the three Fawcett expedition members. An elder of\nthe Kalapalo, Vajuvi, claimed during a filmed BBC interview with Allen that\nthe bones found by Villas-Bôas some 45 years before were not really\nFawcett's.[32][33] Vajuvi also denied that his tribe had any part in the\nFawcetts' disappearance. No conclusive evidence supports either statement.\n\n### Russian\ndocumentary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Russian documentary\")]\n\nIn 2003, a Russian documentary film, \"Проклятье золота инков / Экспедиция\nПерси Фоссета в Амазонку\" (_The Curse of the Incas ' Gold / Expedition of\nPercy Fawcett to the Amazon_), was released as a part of the television series\n\"Тайны века\" (_Mysteries of the Century_). Among other things, the film\nemphasizes the recent expedition of Oleg Aliyev to the presumed approximate\nplace of Fawcett's last whereabouts and Aliyev's findings, impressions and\npresumptions about Fawcett's fate.[34]\n\n### Commune in the\njungle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Commune in the jungle\")]\n\nOn 21 March 2004, the British newspaper _[The Observer](/wiki/The_Observer\n\"The Observer\")_ reported that television director Misha Williams, who had\nstudied Fawcett's private papers, believed that Fawcett had not intended to\nreturn to Britain but rather meant to found a\n[commune](/wiki/Commune_\\(intentional_community\\) \"Commune \\(intentional\ncommunity\\)\") in the jungle based on [theosophical](/wiki/Theosophy\n\"Theosophy\") principles and the worship of his son Jack.[35] Williams\nexplained his research in some detail in the preface to his play _AmaZonia_ ,\nfirst performed in April 2004.[36]\n\n### Grann's _Lost City of\nZ_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Grann's Lost City of Z\")]\n\nMain article: [_The Lost City of Z_ (book)](/wiki/The_Lost_City_of_Z_\\(book\\)\n\"The Lost City of Z \\(book\\)\")\n\nIn 2005, _[The New Yorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker \"The New Yorker\")_ staff\nwriter [David Grann](/wiki/David_Grann \"David Grann\") visited the Kalapalo\ntribe and reported that it had apparently preserved an oral history about\nFawcett, among the first Europeans the tribe had ever seen. The oral account\nsaid that Fawcett and his party had stayed at their village and then left,\nheading eastward. The Kalapalos warned Fawcett and his companions that if they\nwent that way they would be killed by the \"fierce Indians\" who occupied that\nterritory, but Fawcett insisted on going. The Kalapalos observed smoke from\nthe expedition’s campfire each evening for five days before it disappeared.\nThe Kalapalos said they were sure the fierce Indians had killed them.[14] The\narticle also reports that a monumental civilisation known as\n[Kuhikugu](/wiki/Kuhikugu \"Kuhikugu\") may have actually existed near where\nFawcett was searching, as discovered recently by archaeologist [Michael\nHeckenberger](/wiki/Michael_Heckenberger \"Michael Heckenberger\") and\nothers.[37] Grann's findings are further detailed in his book _[The Lost City\nof Z](/wiki/The_Lost_City_of_Z_\\(book\\) \"The Lost City of Z \\(book\\)\")_\n(2009).\n\n## Works[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Works\")]\n\n  * Fawcett, Percy and Brian Fawcett (1953), _Exploration Fawcett_ , Phoenix Press (2001 reprint), [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number_\\(identifier\\) \"International Standard Book Number \\(identifier\\)\") [1-84212-468-4](/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-84212-468-4 \"Special:BookSources/1-84212-468-4\")\n  * Fawcett, Percy and Brian Fawcett (1953), _Lost Trails, Lost Cities_ , Funk & Wagnalls ASIN B0007DNCV4\n  * Fawcett, Brian (1958), _Ruins in the Sky_ , Hutchinson of London\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Percy_Fawcett&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: In popular culture\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png) | This article **appears to contain[trivial, minor, or unrelated](/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information \"Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not\") references to [popular culture](/wiki/Wikipedia:%22In_popular_culture%22_content \"Wikipedia:\"In popular culture\" content\")**.
