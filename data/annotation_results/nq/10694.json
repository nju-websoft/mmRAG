She believed she was not right for the character and she did not\nwin the role.[1] However, the producers asked Minogue's manager Terry Blamey\nif they could write a part especially for her and they came up with Emma\nJackson.[1] Minogue wanted to accept the role, as she loved the character's\npersonality, but she was in the middle of recording her album and was nervous\nabout relocating to Sydney for filming.[2] Blamey decided that she should have\na short run on the show and negotiated a thirteen-week contract, with an\noption to extend once her album was finished.[2]\n\nMinogue stayed with the show for a year, before she quit to launch her music\ncareer in 1990.[3][4] In October 2007, it was rumoured that Minogue was due to\nreprise her role as Emma for the show's 20th anniversary in 2008.[5] However,\nshe did not appear.

Emma attempts to buy alcohol from the local store but Alf's sister\n[Celia](/wiki/Celia_Stewart \"Celia Stewart\") ([Fiona\nSpence](/wiki/Fiona_Spence \"Fiona Spence\")) refuses her the sale as she is\nunderage, which causes Emma to insult Celia. Emma tells Ailsa she thought she\nwould be more fun because she had been in jail and that was why she'd asked to\nstay with her. Ailsa refused to admit what she had been jailed for but reminds\nEmma that the experience was unpleasant. They both agree to stay out of each\nother's way.\n\nAilsa gives Emma a job at the Bayside Diner but she constantly winds up\nAilsa's business partner [Bobby Simpson](/wiki/Bobby_Simpson_\\(Home_and_Away\\)\n\"Bobby Simpson \\(Home and Away\\)\") ([Nicolle Dickson](/wiki/Nicolle_Dickson\n\"Nicolle Dickson\")) Emma proves to be a lazy employee and is threatened by\nBobby with the sack.

Emma is fired from the diner and begins attending Summer\nBay High, where she organises a student rebellion against the uniform. The\nplan fails when Donald turns up in punk clothing himself. Emma then encourages\nViv to skip school and accept a ride from two guys who drive them out to a\ndeserted forest.
