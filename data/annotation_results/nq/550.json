a [chemical element](/wiki/Chemical_element \"Chemical element\")\nwith symbol **Si** and [atomic number](/wiki/Atomic_number \"Atomic number\")\n14\\. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, it\nis a [tetravalent](/wiki/Tetravalence \"Tetravalence\")\n[metalloid](/wiki/Metalloid \"Metalloid\") and\n[semiconductor](/wiki/Semiconductor \"Semiconductor\"). It is a member of [group\n14](/wiki/Carbon_group \"Carbon group\") in the periodic table, along with\n[carbon](/wiki/Carbon \"Carbon\") above it and germanium, [tin](/wiki/Tin\n\"Tin\"), and [lead](/wiki/Lead \"Lead\") below. It is rather unreactive, though\nless so than germanium, and has a very large chemical affinity for oxygen; as\nsuch, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by\n[Jöns Jakob Berzelius](/wiki/J%C3%B6ns_Jakob_Berzelius \"Jöns Jakob\nBerzelius\").\n\nSilicon is the eighth most [common\nelement](/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements \"Abundance of the chemical\nelements\") in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element\nin the Earth's crust. It is most widely distributed in [dusts](/wiki/Dust\n\"Dust\"), [sands](/wiki/Sand \"Sand\"), [planetoids](/wiki/Planetoids\n\"Planetoids\"), and [planets](/wiki/Planet \"Planet\") as various forms of\n[silicon dioxide](/wiki/Silicon_dioxide \"Silicon dioxide\") (silica) or\n[silicates](/wiki/Silicate \"Silicate\"). Over 90% of the Earth's crust is\ncomposed of [silicate minerals](/wiki/Silicate_minerals \"Silicate minerals\"),\nmaking silicon the [second most abundant\nelement](/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust \"Abundance of elements\nin Earth's crust\") in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after\n[oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\").[9]\n\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, and often with\nlittle processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial\nconstruction with [clays](/wiki/Clays \"Clays\"), [silica\nsand](/wiki/Silica_sand \"Silica sand\"), and [stone](/wiki/Stone \"Stone\").\nSilicates are used in [Portland cement](/wiki/Portland_cement \"Portland\ncement\") for [mortar](/wiki/Mortar_\\(masonry\\) \"Mortar \\(masonry\\)\") and\n[stucco](/wiki/Stucco \"Stucco\"), and mixed with silica sand and\n[gravel](/wiki/Gravel \"Gravel\") to make [concrete](/wiki/Concrete \"Concrete\")\nfor walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware\n[ceramics](/wiki/Ceramic \"Ceramic\") such as [porcelain](/wiki/Porcelain\n\"Porcelain\"), and in traditional [quartz](/wiki/Quartz \"Quartz\")-based [soda-\nlime glass](/wiki/Soda-lime_glass \"Soda-lime glass\") and many other specialty\n[glasses](/wiki/Glass \"Glass\"). Silicon compounds such as [silicon\ncarbide](/wiki/Silicon_carbide \"Silicon carbide\") are used as abrasives and\ncomponents of high-strength ceramics.\n\nElemental silicon also has a large impact on the modern world economy. Most\nfree silicon is used in the [steel](/wiki/Steel \"Steel\") refining,\n[aluminium](/wiki/Aluminium \"Aluminium\")-casting, and fine chemical industries\n(often to make [fumed silica](/wiki/Fumed_silica \"Fumed silica\")). Even more\nvisibly, the relatively small portion of very highly purified silicon used in\nsemiconductor electronics (< 10%) is essential to [integrated\ncircuits](/wiki/Integrated_circuits \"Integrated circuits\") — most computers,\ncell phones, and modern technology depend on it. Silicon is the basis of the\nwidely used synthetic polymers called [silicones](/wiki/Silicone \"Silicone\").\n\nSilicon is an essential element in biology, although only tiny traces are\nrequired by animals.[10] However, various [sea sponges](/wiki/Sea_sponges \"Sea\nsponges\") and microorganisms, such as [diatoms](/wiki/Diatoms \"Diatoms\") and\n[radiolaria](/wiki/Radiolaria \"Radiolaria\"), secrete skeletal structures made\nof silica.

A few others\nuse instead a [calque](/wiki/Calque \"Calque\") of the Latin root (e.g.\n[Russian](/wiki/Russian_language \"Russian language\") _кремний_ , from\n_кремень_ \"flint\"; [Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\") _πυριτιο_\nfrom _πυρ_ \"fire\"; [Finnish](/wiki/Finnish_language \"Finnish language\") _pii_\nfrom _piikivi_ \"flint\").[15]\n\nIn 1811, [Gay-Lussac](/wiki/Gay-Lussac \"Gay-Lussac\") and\n[Thénard](/wiki/Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard \"Louis Jacques Thénard\") are\nthought to have prepared impure [amorphous silicon](/wiki/Amorphous_silicon\n\"Amorphous silicon\"), through the heating of recently isolated\n[potassium](/wiki/Potassium \"Potassium\") metal with [silicon\ntetrafluoride](/wiki/Silicon_tetrafluoride \"Silicon tetrafluoride\"), but they\ndid not purify and characterize the product, nor identify it as a new\nelement.[16] Silicon was given its present name in 1817 by Scottish chemist\n[Thomas Thomson](/wiki/Thomas_Thomson_\\(chemist\\) \"Thomas Thomson\n\\(chemist\\)\"). He retained part of Davy's name but added \"-on\" because he\nbelieved that silicon was a [nonmetal](/wiki/Nonmetal \"Nonmetal\") similar to\n[boron](/wiki/Boron \"Boron\") and [carbon](/wiki/Carbon \"Carbon\").[17] In 1823,\n[Jöns Jacob Berzelius](/wiki/J%C3%B6ns_Jacob_Berzelius \"Jöns Jacob Berzelius\")\nprepared amorphous silicon using approximately the same method as Gay-Lussac\n(reducing potassium fluorosilicate with molten potassium metal), but purifying\nthe product to a brown powder by repeatedly washing it.[18] As a result, he is\nusually given credit for the element's discovery.[19][20] The same year,\nBerzelius became the first to prepare [silicon\ntetrachloride](/wiki/Silicon_tetrachloride \"Silicon tetrachloride\"); [silicon\ntetrafluoride](/wiki/Silicon_tetrafluoride \"Silicon tetrafluoride\") had\nalready been prepared long before in 1771 by [Carl Wilhelm\nScheele](/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele \"Carl Wilhelm Scheele\") by dissolving\nsilica in [hydrofluoric acid](/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid \"Hydrofluoric\nacid\").[13]\n\nSilicon in its more common crystalline form was not prepared until 31 years\nlater, by [Deville](/wiki/Henri_Etienne_Sainte-Claire_Deville \"Henri Etienne\nSainte-Claire Deville\").[21][22] By [electrolyzing](/wiki/Electrolysis\n\"Electrolysis\") a mixture of [sodium chloride](/wiki/Sodium_chloride \"Sodium\nchloride\") and [aluminium chloride](/wiki/Aluminium_chloride \"Aluminium\nchloride\") containing approximately 10% silicon, he was able to obtain a\nslightly impure [allotrope](/wiki/Allotrope \"Allotrope\") of silicon in\n1854.[23] Later, more cost-effective methods have been developed to isolate\nseveral [allotrope](/wiki/Allotrope \"Allotrope\") forms, the most recent being\n[silicene](/wiki/Silicene \"Silicene\") in 2010.[24][25] Meanwhile, research on\nthe chemistry of silicon continued; [Friedrich\nWöhler](/wiki/Friedrich_W%C3%B6hler \"Friedrich Wöhler\") discovered the first\nvolatile hydrides of silicon, synthesising\n[trichlorosilane](/wiki/Trichlorosilane \"Trichlorosilane\") in 1857 and\n[silane](/wiki/Silane \"Silane\") itself in 1858, but a detailed investigation\nof the [silanes](/wiki/Silanes \"Silanes\") was only carried out in the early\n20th century by [Alfred Stock](/wiki/Alfred_Stock \"Alfred Stock\"), despite\nearly speculation on the matter dating as far back as the beginnings of\nsynthetic organic chemistry in the 1830s.[26] Similarly, the first\n[organosilicon compound](/wiki/Organosilicon_compound \"Organosilicon\ncompound\"),\n[tetraethylsilane](/w/index.php?title=Tetraethylsilane&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Tetraethylsilane \\(page does not exist\\)\"), was synthesised by [Charles\nFriedel](/wiki/Charles_Friedel \"Charles Friedel\") and [James\nCrafts](/wiki/James_Crafts \"James Crafts\") in 1863, but detailed\ncharacterisation of organosilicon chemisry was only done in the early 20th\ncentury by [Frederick Kipping](/wiki/Frederick_Kipping \"Frederick\nKipping\").[13]\n\nStarting in the 1920s, the work of [William Lawrence\nBragg](/wiki/William_Lawrence_Bragg \"William Lawrence Bragg\") on [X-ray\ncrystallography](/wiki/X-ray_crystallography \"X-ray crystallography\")\nsuccessfully elucidated the compositions of the silicates, which had\npreviously been known from [analytical chemistry](/wiki/Analytical_chemistry\n\"Analytical chemistry\") but had not yet been understood, together with [Linus\nPauling](/wiki/Linus_Pauling \"Linus Pauling\")'s development of [crystal\nchemistry](/wiki/Crystal_chemistry \"Crystal chemistry\") and [Victor\nGoldschmidt](/wiki/Victor_Goldschmidt \"Victor Goldschmidt\")'s development of\n[geochemistry](/wiki/Geochemistry \"Geochemistry\"). The middle of the 20th\ncentury saw the development of the chemistry and industrial use of\n[siloxanes](/wiki/Siloxane \"Siloxane\") and the growing use of\n[silicone](/wiki/Silicone \"Silicone\") [polymers](/wiki/Polymer \"Polymer\"),\n[elastomers](/wiki/Elastomer \"Elastomer\"), and [resins](/wiki/Resin \"Resin\").\nIn the late 20th century, the complexity of the crystal chemistry of\n[silicides](/wiki/Silicide \"Silicide\") was mapped, along with the solid-state\nchemistry of [doped](/wiki/Doping_\\(semiconductor\\) \"Doping\n\\(semiconductor\\)\") [semiconductors](/wiki/Semiconductor \"Semiconductor\").[13]\n\nBecause silicon is an important element in high-technology semiconductor\ndevices, many places in the world bear its name. For example, [Santa Clara\nValley](/wiki/Santa_Clara_Valley \"Santa Clara Valley\") in\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\") acquired the nickname [Silicon\nValley](/wiki/Silicon_Valley \"Silicon Valley\") since the element is the base\nmaterial used in the semiconductor industry located there. Since then, many\nother locations have been nicknamed for similar reasons.[27]\n\n## Characteristics\n\n### Physical and atomic\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Silicon-unit-\ncell-3D-balls.png/160px-Silicon-unit-cell-3D-balls.png)](/wiki/File:Silicon-\nunit-cell-3D-balls.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Silicon-unit-cell-3D-balls.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSilicon crystallizes in a diamond cubic crystal structure\n\nA silicon atom has fourteen electrons. In the ground state, they are arranged\nin the electron configuration [Ne]3s23p2. Of these, four are [valence\nelectrons](/wiki/Valence_electron \"Valence electron\"), occupying the 3s\norbital and two of the 3p orbitals. Like the other members of its group, the\nlighter [carbon](/wiki/Carbon \"Carbon\") and the heavier\n[germanium](/wiki/Germanium \"Germanium\"), [tin](/wiki/Tin \"Tin\"), and\n[lead](/wiki/Lead \"Lead\"), it has the same number of valence electrons as\nvalence orbitals: hence, it can complete its [octet](/wiki/Octet_rule \"Octet\nrule\") and obtain the stable [noble gas](/wiki/Noble_gas \"Noble gas\")\nconfiguration of [argon](/wiki/Argon \"Argon\") by forming [sp3 hybrid\norbitals](/wiki/Orbital_hybridization \"Orbital hybridization\"), forming\ntetrahedral SiX4 derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron\npair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to.[28] The first four\n[ionisation energies](/wiki/Ionisation_energy \"Ionisation energy\") of silicon\nare 786.3, 1576.5, 3228.3, and 4354.4 kJ/mol respectively; these figures are\nhigh enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the\nelement. Following [periodic trends](/wiki/Periodic_trend \"Periodic trend\"),\nits single-bond covalent radius of 117.6 pm is intermediate between those of\ncarbon (77.2 pm) and germanium (122.3 pm). The hexacoordinate ionic radius of\nsilicon may be considered to be 40 pm, although this must be taken as a purely\nnotional figure given the lack of a simple Si4+ cation in reality.[29]\n\nAt standard temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny\n[semiconductor](/wiki/Semiconductor \"Semiconductor\") with a bluish-grey\nmetallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with\ntemperature. This arises because silicon has a small energy gap between its\nhighest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied\nones (the conduction band). The [Fermi level](/wiki/Fermi_level \"Fermi level\")\nis about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is as likely\nto be occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at\nroom temperature. However, doping silicon with a [pnictogen](/wiki/Pnictogen\n\"Pnictogen\") such as [phosphorus](/wiki/Phosphorus \"Phosphorus\"),\n[arsenic](/wiki/Arsenic \"Arsenic\"), or [antimony](/wiki/Antimony \"Antimony\")\nintroduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into\nthe conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an\n[n-type](/wiki/Extrinsic_semiconductor \"Extrinsic semiconductor\")\nsemiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a [group 13\nelement](/wiki/Boron_group \"Boron group\") such as [boron](/wiki/Boron\n\"Boron\"), [aluminium](/wiki/Aluminium \"Aluminium\"), and\n[gallium](/wiki/Gallium \"Gallium\") results in the introduction of acceptor\nlevels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band,\ncreating a p-type semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon\ncreates a [p-n junction](/wiki/P-n_junction \"P-n junction\") with a common\nFermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n,\ncreating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a [diode](/wiki/Diode\n\"Diode\") that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more\neasily one way than the other. A [transistor](/wiki/Transistor \"Transistor\")\nis an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two\nn-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the\ncollector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a\n[triode](/wiki/Triode \"Triode\") amplifier.[30]\n\nSilicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions,\nspecifically in a [diamond cubic](/wiki/Diamond_cubic \"Diamond cubic\")\nlattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414 °C. It is not known to have\nany allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are\nknown at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing\n[coordination number](/wiki/Coordination_number \"Coordination number\") with\npressure, culminating in a [hexagonal close-packed](/wiki/Hexagonal_close-\npacked \"Hexagonal close-packed\") allotrope at about 40\n[gigapascals](/wiki/Gigapascal \"Gigapascal\") known as Si–VII (the standard\nmodification being Si–I). Silicon boils at 3265 °C: this, while high, is still\nlower than the temperature at which its lighter congener [carbon](/wiki/Carbon\n\"Carbon\") sublimes (3642 °C) and silicon similarly has a lower [heat of\nvaporisation](/wiki/Heat_of_vaporisation \"Heat of vaporisation\") than carbon,\nconsistent with the fact that the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.[30]\n\n### Isotopes\n\nMain article: [isotopes of silicon](/wiki/Isotopes_of_silicon \"Isotopes of\nsilicon\")\n\nNaturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable\n[isotopes](/wiki/Isotope \"Isotope\"), 28Si (92.23%), 29Si (4.67%), and 30Si\n(3.10%), with 28Si being the most abundant.[31] Out of these, only 29Si is of\nuse in [NMR](/wiki/NMR \"NMR\") and [EPR spectroscopy](/wiki/EPR_spectroscopy\n\"EPR spectroscopy\"),[32] as it is the only one with a nuclear spin (_I_ =\n1/2).[33] All three are produced in stars through the [oxygen-burning\nprocess](/wiki/Oxygen-burning_process \"Oxygen-burning process\").[34]\n\nTwenty [radioisotopes](/wiki/Radioisotopes \"Radioisotopes\") have been\ncharacterized, with the most stable being 32Si with a [half-life](/wiki/Half-\nlife \"Half-life\") of about 150 years, and 31Si with a half-life of 2.62\nhours.[31] All of the remaining [radioactive](/wiki/Radioactive_decay\n\"Radioactive decay\") isotopes have half-lives that are less than seven\nseconds, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than one\ntenth of a second.[31] Silicon does not have any known [nuclear\nisomers](/wiki/Nuclear_isomer \"Nuclear isomer\").[31] 32Si undergoes low-energy\n[beta decay](/wiki/Beta_decay \"Beta decay\") to [32P](/wiki/Phosphorus-32\n\"Phosphorus-32\") and then stable 32[S](/wiki/Sulfur \"Sulfur\"). 31Si may be\nproduced by the [neutron activation](/wiki/Neutron_activation \"Neutron\nactivation\") of natural silicon and is thus useful for quantitative analysis;\nit can be easily detected by its characteristic beta decay to stable\n31[P](/wiki/Phosphorus \"Phosphorus\"), in which the emitted electron carries up\nto 1.48 [MeV](/wiki/Electronvolt \"Electronvolt\") of energy.[33]\n\nThe known isotopes of silicon range in [mass number](/wiki/Mass_number \"Mass\nnumber\") from 22 to 44.[31] The most common [decay mode](/wiki/Decay_mode\n\"Decay mode\") of the isotopes with mass numbers lower than the three stable\nisotopes is [inverse beta decay](/wiki/Inverse_beta_decay \"Inverse beta\ndecay\"), primarily forming aluminium isotopes (13 protons) as [decay\nproducts](/wiki/Decay_product \"Decay product\").[31] The most common decay mode\nfor the heavier unstable isotopes is beta decay, primarily forming phosphorus\nisotopes (15 protons) as decay products.[31]\n\n## Chemistry and compounds\n\nC–X and Si–X bond energies (kJ/mol)[26] X = | C | Si | H | F | Cl | Br | I | O– | N<  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nC–X | 368 | 360 | 435 | 453 | 351 | 293 | 216 | ~360 | ~305  \nSi–X | 360 | 340 | 393 | 565 | 381 | 310 | 234 | 452 | 322  \n  \nCrystalline bulk silicon is rather inert, but becomes more reactive at high\ntemperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous\nsurface layer of [silicon dioxide](/wiki/Silicon_dioxide \"Silicon dioxide\")\n(SiO2) that protects the metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not\nmeasurably react with the air below 900 °C, but formation of the\n[vitreous](/wiki/Vitreous \"Vitreous\") dioxide rapidly increases between 950 °C\nand 1160 °C and when 1400 °C is reached, atmospheric [nitrogen](/wiki/Nitrogen\n\"Nitrogen\") also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si3N4. Silicon reacts\nwith gaseous [sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur \"Sulfur\") at 600 °C and gaseous\n[phosphorus](/wiki/Phosphorus \"Phosphorus\") at 1000 °C. This oxide layer\nnevertheless does not prevent reaction with the [halogens](/wiki/Halogen\n\"Halogen\"); [fluorine](/wiki/Fluorine \"Fluorine\") attacks silicon vigorously\nat room temperature, [chlorine](/wiki/Chlorine \"Chlorine\") does so at about\n300 °C, and [bromine](/wiki/Bromine \"Bromine\") and [iodine](/wiki/Iodine\n\"Iodine\") at about 500 °C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but\nis oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated [nitric\nacid](/wiki/Nitric_acid \"Nitric acid\") and [hydrofluoric\nacid](/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid \"Hydrofluoric acid\"); it readily dissolves in\nhot aqueous alkali to form [silicates](/wiki/Silicate \"Silicate\"). At high\ntemperatures, silicon also reacts with [alkyl halides](/wiki/Alkyl_halide\n\"Alkyl halide\"); this reaction can be catalysed by [copper](/wiki/Copper\n\"Copper\") to directly synthesise [organosilicon](/wiki/Organosilicon\n\"Organosilicon\") chlorides as precursors to [silicone](/wiki/Silicone\n\"Silicone\") polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive in the\nliquid state, alloying with most metals to form [silicides](/wiki/Silicide\n\"Silicide\"), and reducing most metal oxides because the [heat of\nformation](/wiki/Heat_of_formation \"Heat of formation\") of silicon dioxide is\nso large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of\n[refractory](/wiki/Refractory \"Refractory\"), unreactive materials such as\n[zirconium dioxide](/wiki/Zirconium_dioxide \"Zirconium dioxide\") or group 4,\n5, and 6 borides.[30]\n\nTetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just\nas it is for carbon chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse\nthan the 2p subshell and does not hybridise as well with the 3s subshell. As a\nresult, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant\ndifferences from that of carbon,[35] and thus octahedral coordination is also\nsignificant.[30] For example, the [electronegativity](/wiki/Electronegativity\n\"Electronegativity\") of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon\n(2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus\nthan those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of\nattraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a\nmuch lower tendency towards [catenation](/wiki/Catenation \"Catenation\")\n(formation of Si–Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon due to the concomitant\nweakening of the Si–Si bond compared to the C–C bond:[36] the average Si–Si\nbond energy is approximately 226 kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356 kJ/mol for\nthe C–C bond.[37] This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally\nbeing much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the\n[double bond rule](/wiki/Double_bond_rule \"Double bond rule\"). On the other\nhand, the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of silicon suggests the\npossibility of [hypervalence](/wiki/Hypervalence \"Hypervalence\"), as seen in\nfive- and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as SiX−  \n5 and SiF2−  \n6.[36] Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and\np orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance\nfrom carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for\nsilicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing\natomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group.\nSilicon already shows some incipient metallic behaviour, particularly in the\nbehaviour of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases\n(though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a\n[metalloid](/wiki/Metalloid \"Metalloid\") rather than a nonmetal.[36] However,\nmetallicity does not become clear until germanium and dominant until tin, with\nthe growing importance of the lower +2 oxidation state.[13]\n\nSilicon shows clear differences with carbon. For example, [organic\nchemistry](/wiki/Organic_chemistry \"Organic chemistry\") has very few analogies\nwith silicon chemistry, while [silicate](/wiki/Silicate \"Silicate\") minerals\nhave a structural complexity unseen in [oxocarbons](/wiki/Oxocarbon\n\"Oxocarbon\").[13] Silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does\ncarbon, and this resemblance is enhanced by the [d-block\ncontraction](/wiki/D-block_contraction \"D-block contraction\") resulting in the\nsize of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than\nperiodic trends would predict.[29] Nevertheless, there are still some\ndifferences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in\ngermanium compared to silicon, that result in germanium being significantly\nmore metallic than silicon. Additionally, the lower Ge–O bond strength\ncompared to the Si–O bond strength results in the absence of \"germanone\"\npolymers that would be analogous to [silicone](/wiki/Silicone \"Silicone\")\npolymers.[37]\n\n### Silicides\n\nMain articles: [Silicide](/wiki/Silicide \"Silicide\") and [Binary compounds of\nsilicon](/wiki/Binary_compounds_of_silicon \"Binary compounds of silicon\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Diagramme_binaire_Fe_Si_analyse_thermique_30.svg/400px-\nDiagramme_binaire_Fe_Si_analyse_thermique_30.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Diagramme_binaire_Fe_Si_analyse_thermique_30.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Diagramme_binaire_Fe_Si_analyse_thermique_30.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPhase diagram of the Fe–Si system\n\nMany metal [silicides](/wiki/Silicide \"Silicide\") are known, most of which\nhave formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to\n[valence](/wiki/Valence_\\(chemistry\\) \"Valence \\(chemistry\\)\"): their bonding\nranges from [metallic](/wiki/Metallic_bond \"Metallic bond\") to\n[ionic](/wiki/Ionic_bond \"Ionic bond\") and [covalent](/wiki/Covalent_bond\n\"Covalent bond\"). Some known stoichiometries are M6Si, M5Si, M4Si, M15Si4,\nM3Si, M5Si2, M2Si, M5Si3, M3Si2, MSi, M2Si3, MSi2, MSi3, and MSi6. They are\nstructurally more similar to the [borides](/wiki/Boride \"Boride\") than the\n[carbides](/wiki/Carbide \"Carbide\"), in keeping with the [diagonal\nrelationship](/wiki/Diagonal_relationship \"Diagonal relationship\") between\n[boron](/wiki/Boron \"Boron\") and silicon, although the larger size of silicon\nthan boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between. The\nheats of formation of the silicides are usually similar to those of the\nborides and carbides of the same elements, but they usually melt at lower\ntemperatures.[38] Silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1–10,\nwith the exception of [beryllium](/wiki/Beryllium \"Beryllium\"): in particular,\n[uranium](/wiki/Uranium \"Uranium\") and the transition metals of groups 4–10\nshow the widest range of stoichiometries. Except for [copper](/wiki/Copper\n\"Copper\"), the metals in groups 11–15 do not form silicides. Most instead form\n[eutectic mixtures](/wiki/Eutectic_mixture \"Eutectic mixture\"), although the\nheaviest [post-transition metals](/wiki/Post-transition_metal \"Post-transition\nmetal\") [mercury](/wiki/Mercury_\\(element\\) \"Mercury \\(element\\)\"),\n[thallium](/wiki/Thallium \"Thallium\"), [lead](/wiki/Lead \"Lead\"), and\n[bismuth](/wiki/Bismuth \"Bismuth\") are completely immiscible with liquid\nsilicon.[38]\n\nSilicides are usually prepared by direct reaction of the elements. For\nexample, the [alkali metals](/wiki/Alkali_metal \"Alkali metal\") and [alkaline\nearth metals](/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal \"Alkaline earth metal\") react with\nsilicon or silicon oxide to give silicides. Nevertheless, even with these\nhighly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable, and\nmost of these compounds are semiconductors. For example, the alkali metal\nsilicides (M+  \n)  \n4(E4−  \n4) contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the Si4−  \n4 anion, isoeelctronic with [white phosphorus](/wiki/White_phosphorus \"White\nphosphorus\"), P4.[38][39] Metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon\natoms (e.g. Cu5Si); with increasing silicon content, catenation increases,\nresulting in isolated clusters of two (e.g. U3Si2) or four silicon atoms (e.g.\n[K+]4[Si4]4−) at first, followed by chains (e.g. CaSi), layers (e.g. CaSi2),\nor three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space (e.g. α-ThSi2)\nas the silicon content rises even higher.[38]\n\nThe silicides of the group 1 and 2 metals are usually more reactive than the\ntransition metal silicides. The latter usually do not react with aqueous\nreagents, except for [hydrofluoric acid](/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid \"Hydrofluoric\nacid\"); however, they do react with much more aggressive reagents like liquid\n[potassium hydroxide](/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide \"Potassium hydroxide\"), or\ngaseous fluorine or [chlorine](/wiki/Chlorine \"Chlorine\") when red-hot. The\npre-transition metal silicides instead readily react with water and aqueous\nacids, usually producing hydrogen or silanes:[38]\n\n    Na2Si + 3 H2O → Na2SiO3 \\+ 3 H2\n    Mg2Si + 2 H2SO4 → 2 MgSO4 \\+ SiH4\n\nProducts often vary with the stoichiometry of the silicide reactant. For\nexample, Ca2Si is polar and non-conducting and has the anti-PbCl2 structure\nwith single isolated silicon atoms, and reacts with water to produce [calcium\nhydroxide](/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide \"Calcium hydroxide\"), hydrated silicon\ndioxide, and hydrogen gas. CaSi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms\ninstead reacts to give silanes and polymeric SiH2, while CaSi2 with its\npuckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water, but will react\nwith dilute hydrochloric acid: the product is a yellow polymeric solid with\nstoichiometry Si2H2O.[38]\n\n### Silanes\n\nMain article: [Silanes](/wiki/Silanes \"Silanes\")\n\nSpeculation on silicon hydride chemistry started from the 1830s, contemporary\nwith the development of synthetic [organic chemistry](/wiki/Organic_chemistry\n\"Organic chemistry\"). [Silane](/wiki/Silane \"Silane\") itself, as well as\n[trichlorosilane](/wiki/Trichlorosilane \"Trichlorosilane\"), were first\nsynthesised by [Friedrich Wöhler](/wiki/Friedrich_W%C3%B6hler \"Friedrich\nWöhler\") and [Heinrich\nBuff](/w/index.php?title=Heinrich_Buff&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heinrich Buff\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") in 1857 by reacting aluminium–silicon alloys with\n[hydrochloric acid](/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid \"Hydrochloric acid\"), and\ncharacterised as SiH4 and SiHCl3 by [Charles Friedel](/wiki/Charles_Friedel\n\"Charles Friedel\") and [Albert Ladenburg](/wiki/Albert_Ladenburg \"Albert\nLadenburg\") in 1867. [Disilane](/wiki/Disilane \"Disilane\") (Si2H6) followed in\n1902, when it was first made by [Henri Moissan](/wiki/Henri_Moissan \"Henri\nMoissan\") and [Samuel Smiles](/wiki/Samuel_Smiles \"Samuel Smiles\") by the\n[protonolysis](/wiki/Protonolysis \"Protonolysis\") of [magnesium\nsilicides](/wiki/Magnesium_silicide \"Magnesium silicide\"). Further\ninvestigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and\nthermal instability of the silanes; it was then that [Alfred\nStock](/wiki/Alfred_Stock \"Alfred Stock\") began the study of silicon hydrides\nin earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as\ncontaminants of his focus, the [boron hydrides](/wiki/Borane \"Borane\"). The\nnames _silanes_ and _boranes_ are due to him, based on analogy with the\n[alkanes](/wiki/Alkane \"Alkane\").[26][40][41] Moissan and Smiles' method of\npreparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal\nsilicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of\nthe products that occurs simultaneously, and thus the preferred route today is\nto treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as [lithium\naluminium hydride](/wiki/Lithium_aluminium_hydride \"Lithium aluminium\nhydride\") in etheric solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or\nRX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable\nmethod to produce substituted silanes.[26]\n\nThe silanes comprise a [homologous series](/wiki/Homologous_series \"Homologous\nseries\") of silicon hydrides with the general formula Si _n_ H2 _n_ \\+ 2. They\nare all strong [reducing agents](/wiki/Reducing_agent \"Reducing agent\").\nUnbranched and branched trains are known up to _n_ = 8, and the cycles Si5H10\nand Si6H12 are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless\ngases; the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids. All silanes are\nvery reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less\nthermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely\nstable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly\n(only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after eight months have passed).[26] They\ndecompose to form polymeric [polysilicon hydride](/wiki/Polysilicon_hydride\n\"Polysilicon hydride\") and hydrogen gas.[42][43] As expected from the\ndifference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the\ncorresponding alkanes and boranes, but more volatile than the corresponding\ngermanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because\nthe larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitates [nucleophilic\nattack](/wiki/Nucleophile \"Nucleophile\") at the silicon, the greater polarity\nof the Si–H bond compared to the C–H bond, and the ability of silicon to\nexpand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's [activation\nenergy](/wiki/Activation_energy \"Activation energy\").[26]\n\nSilane [pyrolysis](/wiki/Pyrolysis \"Pyrolysis\") gives polymeric species and\nfinally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is\ncommercially produced by the pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal\ndecomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C–H or C–C bond and the\nformation of radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating\n[silenes](/wiki/Silene \"Silene\") :SiH2 or :SiHR, as the activation energy of\nthis process (~210 kJ/mol) is much less than the Si–Si and Si–H bond energies.\nWhile pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of\nalkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the\nreaction is carried out in [methanol](/wiki/Methanol \"Methanol\"), controlled\nsolvolysis results in the products SiH2(OMe)2, SiH(OMe)3, and Si(OMe)4. The\nSi–H bond also adds to [alkenes](/wiki/Alkene \"Alkene\"), a reaction which\nproceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane\ninvolved. At 450 °C, silane participates in an [addition\nreaction](/wiki/Addition_reaction \"Addition reaction\") with\n[acetone](/wiki/Acetone \"Acetone\"), as well as a [ring-opening\nreaction](/wiki/Ring-opening_reaction \"Ring-opening reaction\") with [ethylene\noxide](/wiki/Ethylene_oxide \"Ethylene oxide\"). Direct reaction of the silanes\nwith chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the\nreaction of silane with bromine at −80 °C is controlled and yields bromosilane\nand dibromosilane. The monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with\nthe appropriate [hydrogen halide](/wiki/Hydrogen_halide \"Hydrogen halide\")\nwith an Al2X6 catalyst, or by reacting silane with a solid\n[silver](/wiki/Silver \"Silver\") halide in a heated flow reactor:[26]\n\n    SiH4 \\+ 2 AgCl 260 °C→ SiH3Cl + HCl + 2 Ag\n\nAmong the derivatives of silane, [iodosilane](/wiki/Iodosilane \"Iodosilane\")\n(SiH3I) and [potassium\nsilanide](/w/index.php?title=Potassium_silanide&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Potassium silanide \\(page does not exist\\)\") (KSiH3) are very useful\nsynthetic intermediates in the production of more complicated silicon-\ncontaining compounds: the latter is a colourless crystalline ionic solid\ncontaining K+ cations and SiH−  \n3 anions in the [NaCl](/wiki/Sodium_chloride \"Sodium chloride\") structure, and\nis made by the reduction of silane by [potassium](/wiki/Potassium \"Potassium\")\nmetal.[44] Additionally, the reactive hypervalent species SiH−  \n5 is also known.[26] With suitable organic substituents it is possible to\nproduce stable polysilanes: they have surprisingly high electric\nconductivities, arising from [sigma](/wiki/Sigma_bond \"Sigma bond\")\ndelocalisation of the electrons in the chain.[45]\n\n### Halides\n\nSilicon and [silicon carbide](/wiki/Silicon_carbide \"Silicon carbide\") readily\nreact with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, reactive and\nvolatile silicon tetrahalides.[46] [Silicon\ntetrafluoride](/wiki/Silicon_tetrafluoride \"Silicon tetrafluoride\") may also\nbe made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the\nattack of [hydrofluoric acid](/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid \"Hydrofluoric acid\") on\nglass.[47] Heating two different tetrahalides together also produce a random\nmixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange\nreactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with\nincreasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the\nmelting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr3 through SiFClBr2 to\nSiFCl2Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier\nto the group 14 elements is illustrated by the change from an infinite ionic\nstructure in [aluminium fluoride](/wiki/Aluminium_fluoride \"Aluminium\nfluoride\") to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as\ndictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the\nstoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and\nthe smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom.[46]\n[Silicon tetrachloride](/wiki/Silicon_tetrachloride \"Silicon tetrachloride\")\nis manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure\nsilicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon [esters](/wiki/Ester \"Ester\").[46]\nThe silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon\ntetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering\nit more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to\nexpand its octet which carbon lacks.[47] The reaction of silicon fluoride with\nexcess [hydrofluoric acid](/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid \"Hydrofluoric acid\")\nproduces the octahedral [hexafluorosilicate](/wiki/Hexafluorosilicic_acid\n\"Hexafluorosilicic acid\") anion SiF2−  \n6.[47]\n\nAnalogous to the silanes, halopolysilanes Si _n_ X2 _n_ \\+ 2 are also known.\nWhile catenation in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds\nrather than the halides, the opposite is true for silicon, so that the\nhalopolysilanes are known up to at least Si14F30, Si6Cl14, and Si4Br10. A\nsuggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron\nloss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by [pi\nbackbonding](/wiki/Pi_backbonding \"Pi backbonding\") from the filled pπ\norbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty dπ orbitals on silicon: this is\nsimilar to the situation of [carbon monoxide](/wiki/Carbon_monoxide \"Carbon\nmonoxide\") in [metal carbonyl complexes](/wiki/Metal_carbonyl_complex \"Metal\ncarbonyl complex\") and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be\nproduced by [comproportionation](/wiki/Comproportionation\n\"Comproportionation\") of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon, or by\ncondensation of lighter halopolysilanes\n([trimethylammonium](/wiki/Trimethylammonium \"Trimethylammonium\") being a\nuseful catalyst for this reaction).[46]\n\n### Silica\n\n[Silicon dioxide](/wiki/Silicon_dioxide \"Silicon dioxide\") (SiO2), also known\nas silica, is one of the most well-studied compounds, second only to\n[water](/wiki/Properties_of_water \"Properties of water\"). Twelve different\ncrystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being\nα-[quartz](/wiki/Quartz \"Quartz\"), a major constituent of many rocks such as\n[granite](/wiki/Granite \"Granite\") and [sandstone](/wiki/Sandstone\n\"Sandstone\"). It is also known to occur pure as [rock\ncrystal](/wiki/Rock_crystal \"Rock crystal\"); impure forms are known as [rose\nquartz](/wiki/Rose_quartz \"Rose quartz\"), [smoky quartz](/wiki/Smoky_quartz\n\"Smoky quartz\"), [morion](/wiki/Morion_\\(mineral\\) \"Morion \\(mineral\\)\"),\n[amethyst](/wiki/Amethyst \"Amethyst\"), and [citrine](/wiki/Citrine \"Citrine\").\nSome poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as\n[chalcedony](/wiki/Chalcedony \"Chalcedony\"), [chrysoprase](/wiki/Chrysoprase\n\"Chrysoprase\"), [carnelian](/wiki/Carnelian \"Carnelian\"), [agate](/wiki/Agate\n\"Agate\"), [onyx](/wiki/Onyx \"Onyx\"), [jasper](/wiki/Jasper \"Jasper\"),\n[heliotrope](/wiki/Heliotrope_\\(mineral\\) \"Heliotrope \\(mineral\\)\"), and\n[flint](/wiki/Flint \"Flint\"). Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known\nin some other minerals such as [tridymite](/wiki/Tridymite \"Tridymite\") and\n[cristobalite](/wiki/Cristobalite \"Cristobalite\"), as well as the much less\ncommon [coesite](/wiki/Coesite \"Coesite\") and [stishovite](/wiki/Stishovite\n\"Stishovite\"). Biologically generated forms are also known as\n[kieselguhr](/wiki/Kieselguhr \"Kieselguhr\") and [diatomaceous\nearth](/wiki/Diatomaceous_earth \"Diatomaceous earth\").\n[Vitreous](/wiki/Vitrification \"Vitrification\") silicon dioxide is known as\n[tectites](/wiki/Tectite \"Tectite\"), and [obsidian](/wiki/Obsidian\n\"Obsidian\"), and rarely as [lechatelierite](/wiki/Lechatelierite\n\"Lechatelierite\"). Some synthetic forms are known as [keatite](/wiki/Keatite\n\"Keatite\") and [W-silica](/w/index.php?title=W-silica&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"W-silica \\(page does not exist\\)\"). [Opals](/wiki/Opal \"Opal\") are composed\nof complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon\ndioxide.[48]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Quartz%2C_Tibet.jpg/120px-Quartz%2C_Tibet.jpg)](/wiki/File:Quartz,_Tibet.jpg)\n\nQuartz\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/USDA_Mineral_Sandstone_93c3955.jpg/120px-USDA_Mineral_Sandstone_93c3955.jpg)](/wiki/File:USDA_Mineral_Sandstone_93c3955.jpg)\n\nSandstone\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/USDA_Mineral_Smokey_Quartz_93v3949.jpg/80px-USDA_Mineral_Smokey_Quartz_93v3949.jpg)](/wiki/File:USDA_Mineral_Smokey_Quartz_93v3949.jpg)\n\nSmoky quartz\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Amethyst._Magaliesburg%2C_South_Africa.jpg/120px-Amethyst._Magaliesburg%2C_South_Africa.jpg)](/wiki/File:Amethyst._Magaliesburg,_South_Africa.jpg)\n\nAmethyst\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Citrine-sample2.jpg/120px-Citrine-sample2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Citrine-sample2.jpg)\n\nCitrine\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Quartz_-_Agateplate%2C_redbrown-white.jpg/120px-Quartz_-_Agateplate%2C_redbrown-white.jpg)](/wiki/File:Quartz_-_Agateplate,_redbrown-white.jpg)\n\nAgate\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Chryzopras_Polsko.jpg/120px-Chryzopras_Polsko.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chryzopras_Polsko.jpg)\n\nChrysoprase\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Onyx.jpg/120px-Onyx.jpg)](/wiki/File:Onyx.jpg)\n\nOnyx\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Jasper_outcrop_in_the_Bucegi_Mountains.jpg/120px-Jasper_outcrop_in_the_Bucegi_Mountains.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jasper_outcrop_in_the_Bucegi_Mountains.jpg)\n\nJasper\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Quarz_-_Heliotrop_%28Blutjaspis%29.JPG/120px-Quarz_-_Heliotrop_%28Blutjaspis%29.JPG)](/wiki/File:Quarz_-_Heliotrop_\\(Blutjaspis\\).JPG)\n\nHeliotrope\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Tridymite_tabulars_-_Ochtendung%2C_Eifel%2C_Germany.jpg/120px-Tridymite_tabulars_-_Ochtendung%2C_Eifel%2C_Germany.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tridymite_tabulars_-_Ochtendung,_Eifel,_Germany.jpg)\n\nTridymite\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Cristobalite-Fayalite-40048.jpg/120px-Cristobalite-Fayalite-40048.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cristobalite-Fayalite-40048.jpg)\n\nCristobalite\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Coesiteimage.jpg/120px-Coesiteimage.jpg)](/wiki/File:Coesiteimage.jpg)\n\nCoesite\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Lechatelierite_created_by_high_voltage_power_line_arcing_on_rocky_soil-_2014-02-12_23-02.jpg/120px-Lechatelierite_created_by_high_voltage_power_line_arcing_on_rocky_soil-_2014-02-12_23-02.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lechatelierite_created_by_high_voltage_power_line_arcing_on_rocky_soil-_2014-02-12_23-02.jpg)\n\nLechatelierite\n\nMost crystalline forms of silica are made of infinite arrangements of {SiO4}\ntetrahedra connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two\nsilicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form,\nα-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two\ndifferent Si–O distances (159.7 and 161.7 pm) with a Si–O–Si angle of 144°.\nThese helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual α-quartz\ncrystals are optically active. At 537 °C, this transforms quickly and\nreversibly into the similar β-quartz, with a change of the Si–O–Si angle to\n155° but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867 °C results in\nanother reversible phase transition to β-tridymite, in which some Si–O bonds\nare broken to allow for the arrangement of the {SiO4} tetrahedra into a more\nopen and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence\ntridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition\ntemperature; when cooled to about 120 °C it quickly and reversibly transforms\nby slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to α-tridymite,\nsimilarly to the transition from α-quartz to β-quartz. β-tridymite slowly\ntransforms to cubic β-cristobalite at about 1470 °C, which once again exists\nmetastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200–280 °C to\nα-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. β-cristobalite melts at 1713\n°C; the freezing of silica from themelt is quite slow and\n[vitrification](/wiki/Vitrification \"Vitrification\"), or the formation of a\n[glass](/wiki/Glass \"Glass\"), is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica,\nthe {SiO4} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and\nperiodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions\nbetween these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt β-quartz\n(1550 °C) or β-tridymite (1703 °C). Silica boils at approximately 2800 °C.\nOther high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite:\nthese are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite\nimpact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar\nmelting and cooling of silica occurs following [lightning](/wiki/Lightning\n\"Lightning\") strikes, forming glassy [lechatelierite](/wiki/Lechatelierite\n\"Lechatelierite\"). W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO4}\ntetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains\nsimilarly to [silicon disulfide](/wiki/Silicon_disulfide \"Silicon disulfide\")\n(SiS2) and [silicon\ndiselenide](/w/index.php?title=Silicon_diselenide&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Silicon diselenide \\(page does not exist\\)\") (SiSe2): it quickly returns to\nforming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.[48]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0_H2SiO3.JPG/220px-%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0_H2SiO3.JPG)](/wiki/File:%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0_H2SiO3.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0_H2SiO3.JPG\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nCondensed polysilicic acid\n\nSilica is rather inert chemically. It is not attacked by any acids other than\nhydrofluoric acid. However, it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis,\nand does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates to give\nmetal silicates. Among the elements, it is attacked only by fluorine at room\ntemperature to form silicon tetrafluoride: hydrogen and carbon also react, but\nrequire temperatures over 1000 °C to do so. Silica nevertheless reacts with\nmany metal and [metalloid](/wiki/Metalloid \"Metalloid\") oxides to form a wide\nvariety of compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all,\nbut also have many other uses: for example, [sodium\nsilicate](/wiki/Sodium_silicate \"Sodium silicate\") is often used in detergents\ndue to its [buffering](/wiki/Buffer_\\(chemistry\\) \"Buffer \\(chemistry\\)\"),\n[saponifying](/wiki/Saponification \"Saponification\"), and\n[emulsifying](/wiki/Emulsification \"Emulsification\") properties.[48]\n\n### Silicic acids\n\nAdding water to silica drops its melting point by around 800 °C due to the\nbreaking of the structure by replacing Si–O–Si linkages with terminating Si–OH\ngroups. Increasing water concentration results in the formation of hydrated\n[silica gels](/wiki/Silica_gel \"Silica gel\") and [colloidal](/wiki/Colloid\n\"Colloid\") silica dispersions. Many hydrates and [silicic\nacids](/wiki/Silicic_acid \"Silicic acid\") exist in the most dilute of aqueous\nsolutions, but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense\nand cross-link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations\nfollowing the formula [SiO _x_(OH)4−2 _x_]_n_ , similar to the behaviour of\n[boron](/wiki/Boron \"Boron\"), [aluminium](/wiki/Aluminium \"Aluminium\"), and\n[iron](/wiki/Iron \"Iron\"), among other elements. Hence, although some simple\nsilicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions, such as [orthosilicic\nacid](/wiki/Orthosilicic_acid \"Orthosilicic acid\") Si(OH)4 and [metasilicic\nacid](/w/index.php?title=Metasilicic_acid&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Metasilicic\nacid \\(page does not exist\\)\") SiO(OH)2, none of these are likely to exist in\nthe solid state.[48]\n\n### Silicate minerals\n\nMain article: [Silicate minerals](/wiki/Silicate_minerals \"Silicate minerals\")\n\nTypical coordination of metal cations in silicates (ionic radii in [pm](/wiki/Picometre \"Picometre\"))[49] CN 4 | LiI  \n(59) | BeII (27) | AlIII (39) | SiIV (26) |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCN 6 | NaI (102) | MgII (72) | AlIII (54) | TiIV (61) | FeII (78)  \nCN 8 | KI (151) | CaII (112) |  |  |   \nCN 12 | KI (164) |  |  |  |   \n  \nAbout 95% of the Earth's [crustal](/wiki/Crust_\\(geology\\) \"Crust\n\\(geology\\)\") rocks are made of silica or silicate and\n[aluminosilicate](/wiki/Aluminosilicate \"Aluminosilicate\") minerals, as\nreflected in oxygen, silicon, and aluminium being the three most common\nelements in the crust (in that order).[49] Measured by mass, silicon makes up\n27.7% of the [Earth's crust](/wiki/Earth%27s_crust \"Earth's crust\").[50] Pure\nsilicon crystals are very rarely found in nature, but notable exceptions are\ncrystals as large as to 0.3 mm across found during sampling gasses from the\n[Kudriavy](/wiki/Medvezhya \"Medvezhya\") volcano on the island of\n[Iturup](/wiki/Iturup \"Iturup\"), one of the [Kuril\nIslands](/wiki/Kuril_Islands \"Kuril Islands\").[51][52]\n\nSilicate and aluminosilicate minerals have many different structures and\nvarying stoichiometry, but they may be classified following some general\nprinciples. Tetrahedral {SiO4} units are common to almost all these compounds,\neither as discrete structures, or combined into larger units by the sharing of\ncorner oxygen atoms. These may be divided into _neso_ -silicates (discrete\n{SiO4} units) sharing no oxygen atoms, _soro_ -silicates (discrete {Si2O7}\nunits) sharing one, _cyclo_ -silicates (closed ring structures) and _ino_\n-silicates (continuous chain or ribbon structures) both sharing two, _phyllo_\n-silicates (continuous sheets) sharing three, and _tecto_ -silicates\n(continuous three-dimensional frameworks) sharing four. The lattice of oxygen\natoms that results is usually close-packed or close to it, with the charge\nbeing balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites\naccording to size.[49]\n\nThe [orthosilicates](/wiki/Orthosilicate \"Orthosilicate\") MII  \n2SiO  \n4 (M = Be, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn) and ZrSiO4 are _neso_ -silicates. Be2SiO4\n([phenacite](/wiki/Phenacite \"Phenacite\")) is rather unusual as both BeII and\nSiIV occupy tetrahedral four-coordinated sites; the other divalent cations\ninstead occupy six-coordinated octahedral sites and often isomorphously\nreplace each other as in [olivine](/wiki/Olivine \"Olivine\"), (Mg,Fe,Mn)2SiO4.\n[Zircon](/wiki/Zircon \"Zircon\"), ZrSiO4, demands eight-coordination of the\nZrIV cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius (84\npm). Also significant are the [garnets](/wiki/Garnet \"Garnet\"), [MII  \n3MIII  \n2(SiO  \n4)  \n3], in which the divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe) are eight-coordinated and\nthe trivalent ones are six-coordinated (e.g. Al, Cr, Fe). Regular coordination\nis not always present: for example, it is not found in Ca2SiO4, which mixes\nsix- and eight-coordinate sites for CaII. _Soro_ -silicates, involving\ndiscrete double or triple tetrahedral units, are quite rare: metasilicates\ninvolving cyclic \"[(SiO3)_n_]2 _n_ −\" units of corner-abutting tetrahedra\nforming a polygonal ring are also known.[49]\n\nChain metasilicates, {SiO2−  \n3}  \n∞, form by the corner-sharing of an indefinite chain of linked {SiO4}\ntetrahedra. Many differences arise due to the differing repeat distances of\nconformation across the line of tetrahedra. A repeat distance of two is most\ncommon, as in most [pyroxene](/wiki/Pyroxene \"Pyroxene\") minerals, but repeat\ndistances of one, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, and twelve are also\nknown. These chains can then link across each other to form double chains and\nribbons, as in the [asbestos](/wiki/Asbestos \"Asbestos\") minerals, involving\nrepeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings.[49]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Zeolite-\nZSM-5-vdW.png/220px-Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png)](/wiki/File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA typical zeolite structure\n\nLayer silicates, such as the clay minerals and the [micas](/wiki/Mica \"Mica\"),\nare very common, and are often formed by horizontal cross-linking of\nmetasilicate chains or planar condensation of smaller units. An example is\n[kaolinite](/wiki/Kaolinite \"Kaolinite\") [Al2(OH)4Si2O5]; in many of these\nminerals cation and anion replacement is common, so that for example\ntetrahedral SiIV may be replaced by AlIII, octahedral AlIII by MgII, and OH−\nby F−. Three-dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very\ncomplex; they may be conceived of as starting from the SiO2 structure, but\nhaving replaced up to one-half of the SiIV atoms with AlIII they require more\ncations to be included in the structure to balance charge. Examples include\n[feldspars](/wiki/Feldspar \"Feldspar\") (the most abundant minerals on the\nEarth), [zeolites](/wiki/Zeolite \"Zeolite\"), and\n[ultramarines](/wiki/Ultramarine \"Ultramarine\"). Many feldspars can be thought\nof as forming part of the ternary system NaAlSi3O8–KAlSi3O8–CaAl2Si2O8. Their\nlattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting AlIII to undergo six-\ncoordination rather than four-coordination, and this reaction destroying\nfeldspars may be a reason for the [Mohorovičić\ndiscontinuity](/wiki/Mohorovi%C4%8Di%C4%87_discontinuity \"Mohorovičić\ndiscontinuity\"), which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same\nchemical composition but different lattices, although this is not a\nuniversally held view. Zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their\nframeworks ([truncated cuboctahedra](/wiki/Truncated_cuboctahedron \"Truncated\ncuboctahedron\") being most common, but other polyhedra are also known as\nzeolite cavities), allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as\nwater in their structure. Ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms\nand include a variety of other anions such as Cl−, SO2−  \n4, and S2−  \n2, but are otherwise similar to the feldspars.[49]\n\n### Other inorganic compounds\n\n[Silicon disulfide](/wiki/Silicon_disulfide \"Silicon disulfide\") (SiS2) is\nformed by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at 100 °C; sublimation of the\nresulting compound in nitrogen results in white, flexible long fibres\nreminiscent of [asbestos](/wiki/Asbestos \"Asbestos\") with a structure similar\nto W-silica. This melts at 1090 °C and sublimes at 1250 °C; at high\ntemperature and pressure this transforms to a crystal structure analogous to\ncristobalite. However, SiS2 lacks the variety of structures of SiO2, and\nquickly hydrolyses to silica and [hydrogen sulfide](/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide\n\"Hydrogen sulfide\"). It is also ammonoloysed quickly and completely by liquid\n[ammonia](/wiki/Ammonia \"Ammonia\") as follows to form an [imide](/wiki/Imide\n\"Imide\"):[53]\n\n    SiS2 \\+ 4 NH3 → Si(NH)2 \\+ 2 NH4SH\n\nIt reacts with the sulfides of sodium, magnesium, aluminium, and iron to form\nmetal [thiosilicates](/w/index.php?title=Thiosilicate&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Thiosilicate \\(page does not exist\\)\"): reaction with [ethanol](/wiki/Ethanol\n\"Ethanol\") results in\n[ethylsilicate](/w/index.php?title=Ethylsilicate&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Ethylsilicate \\(page does not exist\\)\") Si(OEt)4 and hydrogen sulfide.\nEthylsilicate is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or\nfilm-like forms of silica. Reacting hydrogen sulfide with silicon tetrahalides\nyields silicon thiohalides such as S(SiCl)3, cyclic Cl2Si(μ-S)2SiCl2, and\ncrystalline (SiSCl2)4. Despite the [double bond rule](/wiki/Double_bond_rule\n\"Double bond rule\"), stable organosilanethiones RR'Si=S have been made thanks\nto the stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an\n[amine](/wiki/Amine \"Amine\") group.[53]\n\n[Silicon nitride](/wiki/Silicon_nitride \"Silicon nitride\"), Si3N4, can be\nformed by directly reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300 °C, but a more\neconomical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of\nnitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500 °C. It would make a promising\n[ceramic](/wiki/Ceramic \"Ceramic\") if not for the difficulty of working with\nand sintering it: it is chemically near-totally inert, and even above 1000 °C\nit keeps its strength, shape, and continues to be resistant to wear and\ncorrosion. It is very hard (9 on the [Mohs hardness\nscale](/wiki/Mohs_hardness_scale \"Mohs hardness scale\")), dissociates only at\n1900 °C at 1 atm, and is quite dense (density 3.185 g/cm3), because of its\ncompact structure similar to that of phenacite (Be2SiO4). A similar refractory\nmaterial is Si2N2O, formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450 °C in an\nargon stream containing 5% nitrogen gas, involving 4-coordinate silicon and\n3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by\nnon-linear Si–O–Si linkages to each other.[53]\n\nReacting silyl halides with ammonia or alkylammonia derivatives in the gaseous\nphase or in ethanolic solution produces various volatile silylamides, which\nare silicon analogues of the [amines](/wiki/Amine \"Amine\"):[53]\n\n    3 SiH3Cl + 4 NH3 → N(SiH3)3 \\+ 3 NH4Cl\n    SiH3Br + 2 Me2NH → SiH3NMe2 \\+ Me2NH2Br\n    4 SiH3I + 5 N2H4 → (SiH3)2NN(SiH3)2 \\+ 4 N2H5I\n\nMany such compounds have been prepared, the only known restriction being that\nthe nitrogen is always tertiary, and species containing the SiH–NH group are\nunstable at room temperature. The stoichiometry around the nitrogen atom in\ncompounds such as N(SiH3)3is planar, which has been attributed to a pπ–dπ\ninteraction between a lone pair on nitrogen and an empty dπ orbital on\nsilicon. Similarly, trisilylamines are weaker as ligands than their carbon\nanalogues, the tertiary [amines](/wiki/Amine \"Amine\"), although substitution\nof some SiH3 groups by CH3 groups mitigates this weakness. Thus, for example,\nN(SiH3)3 does not form an [adduct](/wiki/Adduct \"Adduct\") with\n[BH3](/wiki/Borane \"Borane\") at all, while MeN(SiH3)2 and Me2NSiH3 form\nadducts at low temperatures that decompose upon warming. Some silicon\nanalogues of [imines](/wiki/Imine \"Imine\"), with a Si=N double bond, are\nknown: the first found was Bu _t_ 2Si=N–SiBu _t_ 3, which was discovered in\n1986.[53]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/SiC_p1390066.jpg/220px-\nSiC_p1390066.jpg)](/wiki/File:SiC_p1390066.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:SiC_p1390066.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSilicon carbide\n\n[Silicon carbide](/wiki/Silicon_carbide \"Silicon carbide\") (SiC) was first\nmade by [Edward Goodrich Acheson](/wiki/Edward_Goodrich_Acheson \"Edward\nGoodrich Acheson\") in 1891, who named it carborundum to reference its\nintermediate hardness and abrasive power between [diamond](/wiki/Diamond\n\"Diamond\") (an allotrope of carbon) and [corundum](/wiki/Corundum \"Corundum\")\n([aluminium oxide](/wiki/Aluminium_oxide \"Aluminium oxide\")). He soon founded\na company to manufacture it, and today about one million tonnes are produced\neach year.[54] Silicon carbide exists in about 250 crystalline forms.[55] The\npolymorphism of SiC is characterized by a large family of similar crystalline\nstructures called polytypes. They are variations of the same chemical compound\nthat are identical in two dimensions and differ in the third. Thus, they can\nbe viewed as layers stacked in a certain sequence.[56] It is made industrially\nby reduction of quartz sand with excess coke or anthracite at 2000–2500 °C in\nan electric furnace:[54]\n\n    SiO2 \\+ 2 C → Si + 2 CO\n    Si + C → SiC\n\nIt is the most thermally stable binary silicon compound, only decomposing\nthrough loss of silicon starting from around 2700 °C. It is resistant to most\naqueous acids, [phosphoric acid](/wiki/Phosphoric_acid \"Phosphoric acid\")\nbeing an exception. It forms a protective layer of [silicon\ndioxide](/wiki/Silicon_dioxide \"Silicon dioxide\") on the surface and hence\nonly oxidises appreciably in air above 1000 °C; removal of this layer by\nmolten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is\nrapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl4 and carbon at 100 °C and\nSiCl4 and [CCl4](/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride \"Carbon tetrachloride\") at 1000\n°C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory materia, as it is\nchemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp\ncutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an\nextrinsic semiconductor upon being doped.[54] In its diamond-like behaviour it\nserves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and\nsilicon.[57]\n\n### Organosilicon compounds\n\nMain article: [Organosilicon](/wiki/Organosilicon \"Organosilicon\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/HydrosilylationTriphenylsilylhydride.png/400px-\nHydrosilylationTriphenylsilylhydride.png)](/wiki/File:HydrosilylationTriphenylsilylhydride.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HydrosilylationTriphenylsilylhydride.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nA hydrosilylation reaction, in which Si–H is added to an unsaturated substrate\n\nBecause the Si–C bond is close in strength to the C–C bond, organosilicon\ncompounds tend to be markedly thermally and chemically stable. For example,\n[tetraphenylsilane](/w/index.php?title=Tetraphenylsilane&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Tetraphenylsilane \\(page does not exist\\)\") (SiPh4) may be distilled in air\neven at its boiling point of 428 °C, and so can its substituted derivatives\nPh3SiCl and Ph2SiCl2, which boil at 378 °C and 305 °C respectively.\nFurthermore, since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners, organosilicon\nchemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry, for\nexample in the propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming\nmultiple bonds.[57] However, significant differences also arise: since silicon\nis more electropositive than carbon, bonds to more electronegative elements\nare generally stronger with silicon than with carbon, and vice versa. Thus the\nSi–F bond is significantly stronger than even the [C–F\nbond](/wiki/Carbon%E2%80%93fluorine_bond \"Carbon–fluorine bond\") and is one of\nthe strongest single bonds, while the Si–H bond is much weaker than the C–H\nbond and is readily broken. Furthermore, the ability of silicon to expand its\noctet is not shared by carbon, and hence some organosilicon reactions have no\norganic analogues. For example, nucleophilic attack on silicon does not\nproceed by the [SN2](/wiki/SN2_reaction \"SN2 reaction\") or\n[SN1](/wiki/SN1_reaction \"SN1 reaction\") processes, but instead goes through a\nnegatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a\nsubstitution at a hindered tertiary atom. This works for silicon, unlike for\ncarbon, because the long Si–C bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the\nd-orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack,\nunlike for example a C–O σ* antibonding orbital. Nevertheless, despite these\ndifferences, the mechanism is still often called \"SN2 at silicon\" for\nsimplicity.[58]\n\nOne of the most useful silicon-containing groups is\n[trimethylsilyl](/wiki/Trimethylsilyl \"Trimethylsilyl\"), Me3Si–. The Si–C bond\nconnecting it to the rest of the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to\nremain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so\nstrong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the\n[fluoride](/wiki/Fluoride \"Fluoride\") ion, which is a very weak nucleophile\nfor carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds. It may\nbe compared to acidic [protons](/wiki/Proton \"Proton\"); while trisilylmethyl\nis removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually\npromote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best\nattacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals\nfar down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, [selenium](/wiki/Selenium\n\"Selenium\"), or [iodine](/wiki/Iodine \"Iodine\")), or even both, silicon is\nbest attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such\nhighly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For\nexample, enolates react at the carbon in [haloalkanes](/wiki/Haloalkane\n\"Haloalkane\"), but at the oxygen in [silyl](/wiki/Silyl \"Silyl\") chlorides;\nand when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as\na nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would\nexpect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is\nstrongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the [silyl\nether](/wiki/Silyl_ether \"Silyl ether\")\n[hexamethyldisiloxane](/wiki/Hexamethyldisiloxane \"Hexamethyldisiloxane\"),\n(Me3Si)2O. Conversely, while the SN2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the\npresence of a partial positive charge (δ+) at the carbon, the analogous \"SN2\"\nreaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the silyl\n[triflates](/wiki/Triflate \"Triflate\") are so electrophilic that they react\n108 to 109 times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing\nnucleophiles. [Trimethylsilyl triflate](/wiki/Trimethylsilyl_triflate\n\"Trimethylsilyl triflate\") is in particular a very good [Lewis\nacid](/wiki/Lewis_acid \"Lewis acid\") and is used to convert\n[carbonyl](/wiki/Carbonyl \"Carbonyl\") compounds to [acetals](/wiki/Acetal\n\"Acetal\") and [silyl enol ethers](/wiki/Silyl_enol_ether \"Silyl enol ether\"),\nreacting them together analogously to the [aldol\nreaction](/wiki/Aldol_reaction \"Aldol reaction\").[58]\n\nSi–C bonds are commonly formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation\nis often carried out in small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with\n[organolithium](/wiki/Organolithium \"Organolithium\"),\n[Grignard](/wiki/Grignard_reagent \"Grignard reagent\"), or\n[organoaluminium](/wiki/Organoaluminium \"Organoaluminium\") reagents, or by\ncatalytic addition of Si–H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the\ndrawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and\nphenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl\nor aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic [copper](/wiki/Copper\n\"Copper\") as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many\nderivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive\nthan their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis,\nalcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.[57]\n\n### Silicone polymers\n\nMain article: [Silicone](/wiki/Silicone \"Silicone\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/PmdsStructure.png/220px-\nPmdsStructure.png)](/wiki/File:PmdsStructure.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PmdsStructure.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nStructure of [polydimethylsiloxane](/wiki/Polydimethylsiloxane\n\"Polydimethylsiloxane\"), the principal component of silicones\n\nThe word \"silicone\" was first used by [Frederick\nKipping](/wiki/Frederick_Kipping \"Frederick Kipping\") in 1901. He invented the\nword to illustrate the similarity of chemical formulae between Ph2SiO and\n[benzophenone](/wiki/Benzophenone \"Benzophenone\"), Ph2CO, although he also\nstressed the lack of chemical resemblance due to the polymeric structure of\nPh2SiO, which is not shared by Ph2CO.[57]\n\nSilicones may be considered analogous to mineral silicates, in which the\nmethyl groups of the silicones correspond to the\n[isoelectronic](/wiki/Isoelectronic \"Isoelectronic\") O− of the silicates.[57]\nThey are quite stable to extreme temperatures, oxidation, and water, and have\nuseful dielectric, antistick, and antifoam properties. Furthermore, they are\nresistant over long periods of time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering,\nand are inert physiologically. They are fairly unreactive, but do react with\nconcentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents, and\noccasionally can be even used as mild reagents for selective syntheses. For\nexample, (Me3Si)2O is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of\n[molybdenum](/wiki/Molybdenum \"Molybdenum\") and [tungsten](/wiki/Tungsten\n\"Tungsten\") oxyhalides, converting a [tungsten\nhexachloride](/wiki/Tungsten_hexachloride \"Tungsten hexachloride\") suspension\nin [dichloroethane](/wiki/Dichloroethane \"Dichloroethane\") solution\nquantitatively to WOCl4 in under an hour at room temperature, and then to\nyellow WO2Cl2 at 100 °C in light petroleum at a yield of 95% overnight.[57]\n\n## Occurrence\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Olivine-\ngem7-10a.jpg/220px-Olivine-gem7-10a.jpg)](/wiki/File:Olivine-gem7-10a.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Olivine-gem7-10a.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOlivine\n\nIn the universe, silicon is the seventh most abundant element, coming after\n[hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen \"Hydrogen\"), [helium](/wiki/Helium \"Helium\"),\n[carbon](/wiki/Carbon \"Carbon\"), [nitrogen](/wiki/Nitrogen \"Nitrogen\"),\n[oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\"), and [neon](/wiki/Neon \"Neon\"). These\nabundances are not replicated well on Earth due to substantial separation of\nthe elements taking place during the formation of the [Solar\nSystem](/wiki/Solar_System \"Solar System\"). Silicon makes up 27.2% of the\nEarth's crust by weight, second only to oxygen at 45.5%, with which it is\nalways associated in nature. Further fractionation took place in the formation\nof the Earth by [planetary differentiation](/wiki/Planetary_differentiation\n\"Planetary differentiation\"): [Earth's core](/wiki/Earth%27s_core \"Earth's\ncore\"), which makes up 31.5% of the mass of the Earth, has approximate\ncomposition Fe25Ni2Co0.1S3; the [mantle](/wiki/Mantle_\\(geology\\) \"Mantle\n\\(geology\\)\") makes up 68.1% of the Earth's mass and is composed mostly of\ndenser oxides and silicates, an example being [olivine](/wiki/Olivine\n\"Olivine\"), (Mg,Fe)2SiO4; while the lighter siliceous minerals rise to the\nsurface and form the crust, making up 0.4% of the Earth's mass.[59]\n\nThe crystallisation of [igneous rocks](/wiki/Igneous_rock \"Igneous rock\") from\nmagma depends on a number of factors; among them are the chemical composition\nof the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals\nto be formed, such as [lattice energy](/wiki/Lattice_energy \"Lattice energy\"),\nmelting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled,\n[olivine](/wiki/Olivine \"Olivine\") appears first, followed by\n[pyroxene](/wiki/Pyroxene \"Pyroxene\"), [amphibole](/wiki/Amphibole\n\"Amphibole\"), [biotite](/wiki/Biotite \"Biotite\") mica, [orthoclase\nfeldspar](/wiki/Orthoclase_feldspar \"Orthoclase feldspar\"), [muscovite\nmica](/wiki/Muscovite_mica \"Muscovite mica\"), [quartz](/wiki/Quartz \"Quartz\"),\n[zeolites](/wiki/Zeolite \"Zeolite\"), and finally hydrothermal minerals. This\nsequence shows a trend towards increasingly complex silicate units with\ncooling, and the introduction of [hydroxide](/wiki/Hydroxide \"Hydroxide\") and\n[fluoride](/wiki/Fluoride \"Fluoride\") anions in addition to oxides. Many\nmetals can substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo\n[weathering](/wiki/Weathering \"Weathering\"), transport, and deposition,\n[sedimentary rocks](/wiki/Sedimentary_rock \"Sedimentary rock\") like clay,\nshale, and sandstone are formed. [Metamorphism](/wiki/Metamorphism\n\"Metamorphism\") also can occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an\neven vaster variety of minerals.[59]\n\n## Production\n\nSilicon of 96–99% purity is made by reducing [quartzite](/wiki/Quartzite\n\"Quartzite\") or sand with highly pure [coke](/wiki/Coke_\\(fuel\\) \"Coke\n\\(fuel\\)\"). The reduction is carried out in an [electric arc\nfurnace](/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace \"Electric arc furnace\"), with an excess of\nSiO2 used to stop silicon carbide from accumulating:[33]\n\n    SiO2 \\+ 2 C → Si + 2 CO\n    2 SiC + SiO2 → 3 Si + 2 CO\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Ferrosilicon.JPG/200px-\nFerrosilicon.JPG)](/wiki/File:Ferrosilicon.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ferrosilicon.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nFerrosilicon alloy\n\nThis reaction, known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, is usually\nconducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of\n[phosphorus](/wiki/Phosphorus \"Phosphorus\") and [sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur\n\"Sulfur\"), produing [ferrosilicon](/wiki/Ferrosilicon \"Ferrosilicon\").[33]\nFerrosilicon, an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental\nsilicon and iron, accounts for about 80% of the world's production of\nelemental silicon, with China, the leading supplier of elemental silicon,\nproviding 4.6 million [tonnes](/wiki/Tonne \"Tonne\") (or 2/3 of the world\noutput) of silicon, most of which is in the form of ferrosilicon. It is\nfollowed by Russia (610,000 t), Norway (330,000 t), Brazil (240,000 t) and the\nUnited States (170,000 t).[60] Ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and\nsteel industry (see below) with primary use as alloying addition in iron or\nsteel and for de-oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants.[33] Another\nsometimes used reaction is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, as\nfollows:[61]\n\n    3 SiO2 \\+ 4 Al → 3 Si + 2 Al2O3\n\nLeaching powdered 96–97% pure silicon with water results in ~98.5% pure\nsilicon, which is used in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity\nis needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the\nreduction of tetrachlorosilane or trichlorosilane. The former is made by\nchlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of\n[silicone](/wiki/Silicone \"Silicone\") production. These compounds are volatile\nand hence can be purified by repeated [fractional\ndistillation](/wiki/Fractional_distillation \"Fractional distillation\"),\nfollowed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure [zinc](/wiki/Zinc\n\"Zinc\") metal as the reeducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus\nproduced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before\nbeing purified by [zone refining](/wiki/Zone_refining \"Zone refining\"). Other\nroutes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane. Another\nprocess used is the reduction of [sodium\nhexafluorosilicate](/wiki/Sodium_hexafluorosilicate \"Sodium\nhexafluorosilicate\"), a common waste product of the phosphate fertiliser\nindustry, by metallic [sodium](/wiki/Sodium \"Sodium\"): this is highly\nexothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source. Hyperfine silicon is\nmade at a higher purity than almost every other material:\n[transistor](/wiki/Transistor \"Transistor\") production requires impurity\nlevels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 1010, and in special cases\nimpurity levels below 1 part per 1012 are needed and attained.[33]\n\n## Applications\n\n### Compounds\n\nMost silicon is used industrially without being purified, and indeed often\nwith comparatively little processing from its natural form. Over 90% of the\nEarth's crust is composed of [silicate minerals](/wiki/Silicate_minerals\n\"Silicate minerals\"), which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with\nmetallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to\nbalance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays,\n[silica](/wiki/Silica \"Silica\") sand and most kinds of building stone. Thus,\nthe vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as\nthe silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in\nmaking [Portland cement](/wiki/Portland_cement \"Portland cement\") (made mostly\nof calcium silicates) which is used in [building\nmortar](/wiki/Mortar_\\(masonry\\) \"Mortar \\(masonry\\)\") and modern\n[stucco](/wiki/Stucco \"Stucco\"), but more importantly, combined with silica\nsand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals like granite), to make\nthe [concrete](/wiki/Concrete \"Concrete\") that is the basis of most of the\nvery largest industrial building projects of the modern world.[62]\n\nSilica is used to make [fire brick](/wiki/Fire_brick \"Fire brick\"), a type of\nceramic. Silicate minerals are also in whiteware [ceramics](/wiki/Ceramic\n\"Ceramic\"), an important class of products usually containing various types of\nfired [clay](/wiki/Clay \"Clay\") minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates).\nAn example is [porcelain](/wiki/Porcelain \"Porcelain\") which is based on the\nsilicate mineral [kaolinite](/wiki/Kaolinite \"Kaolinite\"). Traditional\n[glass](/wiki/Glass \"Glass\") (silica-based [soda-lime glass](/wiki/Soda-\nlime_glass \"Soda-lime glass\")) also functions in many of the same ways, and is\nalso used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based\n[glass fibers](/wiki/Glass_fiber \"Glass fiber\") are used for [optical\nfiber](/wiki/Optical_fiber \"Optical fiber\"), as well as to produce\n[fiberglass](/wiki/Fiberglass \"Fiberglass\") for structural support and [glass\nwool](/wiki/Glass_wool \"Glass wool\") for thermal insulation.\n\nSilicones are often used in [waterproofing](/wiki/Waterproofing\n\"Waterproofing\") treatments, [molding](/wiki/Molding_\\(process\\) \"Molding\n\\(process\\)\") compounds, mold-[release agents](/wiki/Release_agent \"Release\nagent\"), mechanical seals, high temperature [greases](/wiki/Lubricant\n\"Lubricant\") and waxes, and [caulking](/wiki/Caulking \"Caulking\") compounds.\nSilicone is also sometimes used in [breast implants](/wiki/Breast_implant\n\"Breast implant\"), contact lenses, [explosives](/wiki/Explosive \"Explosive\")\nand [pyrotechnics](/wiki/Pyrotechnics \"Pyrotechnics\").[63] [Silly\nPutty](/wiki/Silly_Putty \"Silly Putty\") was originally made by adding [boric\nacid](/wiki/Boric_acid \"Boric acid\") to [silicone oil](/wiki/Silicone_oil\n\"Silicone oil\").[64] Other silicon compounds function as high-technology\nabrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon [silicon\ncarbide](/wiki/Silicon_carbide \"Silicon carbide\"). Silicon is a component of\nsome [superalloys](/wiki/Superalloy \"Superalloy\").\n\n### Alloys\n\nElemental silicon is added to molten [cast iron](/wiki/Cast_iron \"Cast iron\")\nas [ferrosilicon](/wiki/Ferrosilicon \"Ferrosilicon\") or silicocalcium alloys\nto improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation\nof [cementite](/wiki/Cementite \"Cementite\") where exposed to outside air. The\npresence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so\nthat the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for\neach type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production\nand use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of\nelemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of\nfree silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of [electrical\nsteel](/wiki/Electrical_steel \"Electrical steel\"), modifying its\n[resistivity](/wiki/Resistivity \"Resistivity\") and\n[ferromagnetic](/wiki/Ferromagnetic \"Ferromagnetic\") properties.\n\nThe properties of silicon can be used to modify alloys with metals other than\niron. \"Metallurgical grade\" silicon is silicon of 95–99% purity. About 55% of\nthe world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of\naluminium-silicon alloys ([silumin](/wiki/Silumin \"Silumin\") alloys) for\naluminium part [casts](/wiki/Casting \"Casting\"), mainly for use in the\n[automotive industry](/wiki/Automotive_industry \"Automotive industry\").\nSilicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount\n(12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a [eutectic\nmixture](/wiki/Eutectic_mixture \"Eutectic mixture\") which solidifies with very\nlittle thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed\nfrom stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly\nimproves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.[65][66]\n\n### Electronics\n\nMain article: [Semiconductor device\nfabrication](/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication \"Semiconductor device\nfabrication\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Silicon_wafer_with_mirror_finish.jpg/220px-\nSilicon_wafer_with_mirror_finish.jpg)](/wiki/File:Silicon_wafer_with_mirror_finish.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Silicon_wafer_with_mirror_finish.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSilicon wafer with mirror finish\n\nMost elemental silicon produced remains as a ferrosilicon alloy, and only\nabout 20% is refined to metallurgical grade purity (a total of 1.3–1.5 million\nmetric tons/year). An estimated 15% of the world production of metallurgical\ngrade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity.[66] However, the\neconomic importance of this small very high-purity fraction (especially the ~\n5% which is processed to monocrystalline silicon for integrated circuits) is\ndisproportionately large.\n\nPure [monocrystalline silicon](/wiki/Monocrystalline_silicon \"Monocrystalline\nsilicon\") is used to produce [silicon wafers](/wiki/Wafer_\\(electronics\\)\n\"Wafer \\(electronics\\)\") used in the [semiconductor\nindustry](/wiki/Semiconductor_industry \"Semiconductor industry\"), in\nelectronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency\n[photovoltaic](/wiki/Photovoltaic \"Photovoltaic\") applications. Pure silicon\nis an [intrinsic semiconductor](/wiki/Intrinsic_semiconductor \"Intrinsic\nsemiconductor\"), which means that unlike metals, it conducts [electron\nholes](/wiki/Electron_hole \"Electron hole\") and electrons released from atoms\nby heat; silicon's [electrical conductivity](/wiki/Electrical_conductivity\n\"Electrical conductivity\") increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon\nhas too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a [resistivity](/wiki/Resistivity\n\"Resistivity\")) to be used as a circuit element in electronics. In practice,\npure silicon is [doped](/wiki/Doping_\\(semiconductors\\) \"Doping\n\\(semiconductors\\)\") with small concentrations of certain other elements,\nwhich greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by\ncontrolling the number and charge ([positive](/wiki/Electron_hole \"Electron\nhole\") or [negative](/wiki/Electron \"Electron\")) of activated carriers. Such\ncontrol is necessary for [transistors](/wiki/Transistor \"Transistor\"), [solar\ncells](/wiki/Solar_cell \"Solar cell\"), [semiconductor\ndetectors](/wiki/Semiconductor_detector \"Semiconductor detector\"), and other\n[semiconductor devices](/wiki/Semiconductor_device \"Semiconductor device\")\nused in the computer industry and other technical applications. In [silicon\nphotonics](/wiki/Silicon_photonics \"Silicon photonics\"), silicon can be used\nas a continuous wave [Raman laser](/wiki/Raman_laser \"Raman laser\") medium to\nproduce coherent light, though it is ineffective as an everyday light source.\n\nIn common [integrated circuits](/wiki/Integrated_circuit \"Integrated\ncircuit\"), a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support\nfor the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by\nthin layers of [silicon oxide](/wiki/Silicon_dioxide \"Silicon dioxide\"), an\ninsulator that is easily produced by exposing the element to oxygen under the\nproper conditions. Silicon has become the most popular material for both high\npower semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the\nhighest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering\n[avalanche breakdown](/wiki/Avalanche_breakdown \"Avalanche breakdown\") (an\n[electron avalanche](/wiki/Electron_avalanche \"Electron avalanche\") is created\nwhen heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current,\nwhich produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not\nsoluble in water, which gives it an advantage over [germanium](/wiki/Germanium\n\"Germanium\") (an element with similar properties which can also be used in\nsemiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.[67]\n\nMonocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only\nin production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can\ninterfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon\nmay be employed. These include [hydrogenated amorphous\nsilicon](/wiki/Hydrogenated_amorphous_silicon \"Hydrogenated amorphous\nsilicon\") and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the\nproduction of low-cost, [large-area electronics](/wiki/Large-area_electronics\n\"Large-area electronics\") in applications such as [liquid crystal\ndisplays](/wiki/Liquid_crystal_display \"Liquid crystal display\") and of large-\narea, low-cost, thin-film [solar cells](/wiki/Solar_cells \"Solar cells\"). Such\nsemiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or\npolycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable\nquatities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per\nyear. The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for\nmonocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used\nmostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year,\nwhile monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less\nthan 50,000 tons/year.[66]\n\n### Mechanical watches\n\nSince 2000, silicon has found a new use in mechanical watch movements. Several\nmanufacturers of mechanical watch movements have incorporated silicon parts,\nmainly in the escapements and balance wheel regions. Silicon hair-springs are\nbecoming more common as are silicon escapement wheels and forks. Silicon has\nseveral desirable properties when used in these contexts; It is thermally\nstable, shock resistant, and requires little to no lubrication. Ulysse Nardin\npioneered these applications, with Omega, Breguet, Patek, Rolex, Cartier, and\nDamasko following.[68] Most of these parts for watch movements are\nmanufactured by [deep reactive-ion etching](/wiki/Deep_reactive-ion_etching\n\"Deep reactive-ion etching\") (DRIE).[69]\n\n## Biological role\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/20110123_185042_Diatom.jpg/220px-20110123_185042_Diatom.jpg)](/wiki/File:20110123_185042_Diatom.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:20110123_185042_Diatom.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA diatom, enclosed in a silica cell wall\n\nAlthough silicon is readily available in the form of\n[silicates](/wiki/Silicate \"Silicate\"), very few organisms use it directly.\n[Diatoms](/wiki/Diatom \"Diatom\"), [radiolaria](/wiki/Radiolaria \"Radiolaria\")\nand [siliceous sponges](/wiki/Siliceous_sponge \"Siliceous sponge\") use\n[biogenic silica](/wiki/Biogenic_silica \"Biogenic silica\") as a structural\nmaterial for skeletons. In more advanced plants, the silica\n[phytoliths](/wiki/Phytolith \"Phytolith\") (opal phytoliths) are rigid\nmicroscopic bodies occurring in the cell; some plants, for example\n[rice](/wiki/Rice \"Rice\"), need silicon for their growth.[70][71][72] There is\nsome evidence that silicon is important to nail, hair, bone and skin health in\nhumans,[73] for example in studies that show that premenopausal women with\nhigher dietary silicon intake have higher [bone density](/wiki/Bone_density\n\"Bone density\"), and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and\ndensity in patients with [osteoporosis](/wiki/Osteoporosis\n\"Osteoporosis\").[74] Silicon is needed for synthesis of\n[elastin](/wiki/Elastin \"Elastin\") and [collagen](/wiki/Collagen \"Collagen\"),\nof which the [aorta](/wiki/Aorta \"Aorta\") contains the greatest quantity in\nthe human body.[75]\n\nSilicon is currently under consideration for elevation to the status of a\n\"plant beneficial substance by the Association of American Plant Food Control\nOfficials (AAPFCO).\"[76][77] Silicon has been shown in university and field\nstudies to improve plant cell wall strength and structural integrity,[78]\nimprove drought and frost resistance, decrease lodging potential, and boost\nthe plant's natural pest and disease fighting systems.[79] Silicon has also\nbeen shown to improve plant vigor and physiology by improving root mass and\ndensity, and increasing above-ground plant biomass and crop yields.[78]\n\n## Safety\n\nPeople can be exposed to silicon in the workplace by breathing it in,\nswallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The [Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration](/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration\n\"Occupational Safety and Health Administration\") (OSHA) has set the legal\nlimit ([Permissible exposure limit](/wiki/Permissible_exposure_limit\n\"Permissible exposure limit\")) for silicon exposure in the workplace as 15\nmg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday.\nThe [National Institute for Occupational Safety and\nHealth](/wiki/National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health \"National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health\") (NIOSH) has set a [Recommended\nexposure limit](/wiki/Recommended_exposure_limit \"Recommended exposure limit\")\n(REL) of 10 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an\n8-hour workday.[80]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Amorphous silicon](/wiki/Amorphous_silicon \"Amorphous silicon\")\n  * [Black silicon](/wiki/Black_silicon \"Black silicon\")\n  * [Covalent superconductors](/wiki/Covalent_superconductors \"Covalent superconductors\")\n  * [List of countries by silicon production](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_silicon_production \"List of countries by silicon production\")\n  * [List of silicon producers](/wiki/List_of_silicon_producers \"List of silicon producers\")\n  * [Monocrystalline silicon](/wiki/Monocrystalline_silicon \"Monocrystalline silicon\")\n  * [Silicon Nanowires (SiNWs)](/wiki/Silicon_Nanowire \"Silicon Nanowire\")\n  * [Polycrystalline silicon](/wiki/Polycrystalline_silicon \"Polycrystalline silicon\")\n  * [Printed silicon electronics](/wiki/Printed_silicon_electronics \"Printed silicon electronics\")\n  * [Silicon tombac](/wiki/Silicon_tombac \"Silicon tombac\")\n  * [Silicon Valley](/wiki/Silicon_Valley \"Silicon Valley\")\n  * [Silicon Wadi](/wiki/Silicon_Wadi \"Silicon Wadi\")\n  * [Transistor](/wiki/Transistor \"Transistor\")\n\n**[Books](/wiki/Wikipedia:Books \"Wikipedia:Books\")**  \nView or order collections of articles | \n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png)_**[Silicon](/wiki/Book:Silicon \"Book:Silicon\")**_\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png)_**[Period 3 elements](/wiki/Book:Period_3_elements \"Book:Period 3 elements\")**_\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png)_**[Carbon group](/wiki/Book:Carbon_group \"Book:Carbon group\")**_\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png)_**[Chemical elements (sorted alphabetically)](/wiki/Book:Chemical_elements_\\(sorted_alphabetically\\) \"Book:Chemical elements \\(sorted alphabetically\\)\")**_\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png)_**[Chemical elements (sorted by number)](/wiki/Book:Chemical_elements_\\(sorted_by_number\\) \"Book:Chemical elements \\(sorted by number\\)\")**_\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \n* * *  \n  \n**[Portals](/wiki/Portal:Contents/Portals \"Portal:Contents/Portals\")**  \nAccess related topics | \n\n  * [![Papapishu-Lab-icon-6.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Papapishu-Lab-icon-6.svg/30px-Papapishu-Lab-icon-6.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Papapishu-Lab-icon-6.svg)_**[Chemistry portal](/wiki/Portal:Chemistry \"Portal:Chemistry\")**_\n\n  \n  \n* * *  \n  \nFind out more on Wikipedia's  \n**[Sister projects](/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikimedia_sister_projects \"Wikipedia:Wikimedia sister projects\")** | \n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/22px-Commons-logo.svg.png)[Media](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Silicon \"commons:Special:Search/Silicon\")  \nfrom Commons\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/Wiktionary-logo-v2.svg/30px-Wiktionary-logo-v2.svg.png)[Definitions](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/silicon#English \"wiktionary:Special:Search/silicon\")  \nfrom Wiktionary\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg/30px-Wikibooks-logo.svg.png)[Textbooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Search/Wikijunior:The_Elements/Silicon \"wikibooks:Special:Search/Wikijunior:The Elements/Silicon\")  \nfrom Wikibooks\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/30px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png)[Learning resources](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Special:Search/Silicon \"wikiversity:Special:Search/Silicon\")  \nfrom Wikiversity\n\n  \n  \n## Bibliography\n\n  * [Clayden, Jonathan](/wiki/Jonathan_Clayden \"Jonathan Clayden\"); Greeves, Nick; [Warren, Stuart](/wiki/Stuart_Warren \"Stuart Warren\") (2012). _Organic Chemistry_ (2nd ed.).

Deville used two methods to prepare aluminium: heating aluminium chloride with sodium metal in an inert atmosphere (of hydrogen); and melting aluminum chloride with sodium chloride and then electrolyzing the mixture. In both cases, pure silicon was produced: the silicon dissolved in the molten aluminium, but crystallized upon cooling. Dissolving the crude aluminum in hydrochloric acid revealed flakes of crystallized silicon. See: Henri Sainte-Claire Deville (1854) [\"Note sur deux procédés de préparation de l'aluminium et sur une nouvelle forme du silicium\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=C3VFAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA321) (Note on two procedures for the preparation of aluminium and on a new form of silicon), _Comptes rendus_ , **39** : 321–326.  \nSubsequently Deville obtained crystalline silicon by heating the chloride or\nfluoride of silicon with sodium metal, isolating the amorphous silicon, then\nmelting the amorphous form with salt and heating the mixture until most of the\nsalt evaporated. See: H. Sainte-Claire Deville (1855) [\"Du silicium et du\ntitane\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=tZhDAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1034) (On silicon\nand titanium), _Comptes rendus_ , **40** : 1034–1036.\n\n  22. **Jump up ^** [Information on silicon – history,](http://elements.etacude.com/Si.php) [thermodynamic](/wiki/Thermodynamic \"Thermodynamic\"), chemical, physical and electronic properties: Etacude.com.
