He performed\nthe intro on a [twelve-string guitar](/wiki/Twelve-string_guitar \"Twelve-\nstring guitar\"), processed to sound like it was playing through an AM radio,\nand then overdubbed a fuller-sounding acoustic guitar solo. This passage was\nmixed to sound as though a guitarist were listening to the radio and playing\nalong. As the acoustic part becomes more complex, the 'radio broadcast' fades\naway and Gilmour's voice enters, becoming joined by the full band.[5]\n\nThe intro riff is repeated several times, before Gilmour plays further solos\nwith [scat singing](/wiki/Scat_singing \"Scat singing\") accompaniment. A third\nverse follows, featuring an increasingly expressive vocal from Gilmour and\naudible backing vocals. At the end of the recorded song, the final solo\n[crossfades](/wiki/Crossfader \"Crossfader\") with wind sound effects, and\nfinally segues into the second section of the multi-part suite \"[Shine On You\nCrazy Diamond](/wiki/Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond \"Shine On You Crazy\nDiamond\")\".\n\nLyrically, the song is often considered to be a direct tribute to [Syd\nBarrett](/wiki/Syd_Barrett \"Syd Barrett\"). However, on the documentary _[The\nStory of Wish You Were Here](/wiki/The_Story_of_Wish_You_Were_Here \"The Story\nof Wish You Were Here\")_ , Gilmour and Waters separately describe the original\nconcept that differs from this interpretation. Waters, who mainly wrote the\nlyrics complementing Gilmour's initial riff idea and subsequent joint\ncomposition, describes the lyrics as being directed at himself, as his lyrics\noften are. Being present in one's own life and freeing one's self in order to\ntruly experience life is a main topic in this song. Gilmour, on the other\nhand, recognizes that he does not ever perform the song without remembering\nSyd Barrett. Waters later adds that the song is nevertheless open to\ninterpretation.[6]\n\nBoth David Gilmour and Roger Waters have praised the song as one of Pink\nFloyd's finest. Roger Waters has noted that the collaboration between himself\nand David Gilmour on the song was \"...really good. All bits of it are really,\nreally good. I'm very happy about it.\"[7] David Gilmour has playfully called\n\"Wish You Were Here\" \"a very simple country song\" and stated that \"because of\nits resonance and the emotional weight it carries, it is one of our best\nsongs.\"[8]\n\n##\nRecording[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wish_You_Were_Here_\\(Pink_Floyd_song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Recording\")]\n\n\"Wish You Were Here\" was recorded at [Abbey Road\nStudios](/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios \"Abbey Road Studios\"), as part of the\nsessions for the entire album.\n\nA noted part of the song was a planned contribution by [Stéphane\nGrappelli](/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Grappelli \"Stéphane Grappelli\"). A jazz\nviolinist popular at the time and well known for his collaborations with\n[Yehudi Menuhin](/wiki/Yehudi_Menuhin \"Yehudi Menuhin\"), both violinists were\nrecording in a downstairs studio at Abbey Road at the time. Gilmour had\nsuggested that there be a little \"country fiddle\" at the end of the song and\ninvited them to participate. Grappelli duly obliged (Menuhin declined) on\narranging a session fee of £300, equivalent to £2,300 in 2018.[9] Ultimately\nduring mixing it was decided to almost remove his contribution, although it\ncan just be heard around 5:21. According to Waters it was decided that it\nwould be insulting to credit Grappelli in the sleeve notes for something so\ninaudible, although he did receive the agreed-upon fee.[10][11][12]\n\nAs part of the _[Why Pink Floyd...?](/wiki/Why_Pink_Floyd...%3F \"Why Pink\nFloyd...?\")_ campaign, the _Experience_ and _Immersion_ versions of the _Wish\nYou Were Here_ album include an alternative version of the song where\nGrappelli's part is heard in the instrumental break after the second verse and\nthroughout the third verse before a considerably extended outro. Other less\nobvious differences are audible, for example at the section leading into the\nsecond verse.\n\nThe master tape of the original recording includes an entire performance of\npedal steel guitar and electric guitar solos, played by Gilmour, that were not\nused in the final mix.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Live\nperformances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wish_You_Were_Here_\\(Pink_Floyd_song\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Live performances\")]\n\n\"Wish You Were Here\" made its stage debut on the band's [1977\ntour](/wiki/In_the_Flesh_\\(1977_Pink_Floyd_%27Animals%27_tour\\) \"In the Flesh\n\\(1977 Pink Floyd 'Animals' tour\\)\"), which featured a performance of the\nentire album at every show. It was not played live by the band for nearly ten\nyears after this, yet became a concert staple after its reappearance in 1987,\nand was performed at nearly all subsequent Pink Floyd concerts. In the\noriginal 1977 concert performances, Gilmour would play his [Fender\nStratocaster](/wiki/Fender_Stratocaster \"Fender Stratocaster\") instead of\nacoustic guitar, while [Snowy White](/wiki/Snowy_White \"Snowy White\") played a\ntwelve-string [Ovation](/wiki/Ovation_Guitar_Company \"Ovation Guitar Company\")\nacoustic guitar. At these shows, [Nick Mason](/wiki/Nick_Mason \"Nick Mason\")\ntuned an actual transistor radio on stage to a local radio station, seguing\ninto the pre-recorded part from the album to start the song and [Richard\nWright](/wiki/Richard_Wright_\\(musician\\) \"Richard Wright \\(musician\\)\") would\nperform an extended piano coda as the wind effects played. A live version is\nincluded on _[Pulse](/wiki/Pulse_\\(Pink_Floyd_album\\) \"Pulse \\(Pink Floyd\nalbum\\)\")_. When Pink Floyd were inducted into the [Rock and Roll Hall of\nFame](/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame \"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\"),[13]\nGilmour and Wright (Mason was in the audience) performed the song with the\nassistance of their presenter [Billy Corgan](/wiki/Billy_Corgan \"Billy\nCorgan\") on rhythm guitar.\n\nGilmour has made the song a part of most of his tours, and included a live\nversion on his _[Live in Gdansk](/wiki/Live_in_Gdansk \"Live in Gdansk\")_\nalbum.\n\nOn 13 December 2014 [David Gilmour](/wiki/David_Gilmour \"David Gilmour\") was a\nguest performer at a concert by the [Bombay Bicycle\nClub](/wiki/Bombay_Bicycle_Club \"Bombay Bicycle Club\") at [Earls Court\nArena](/wiki/Earl%27s_Court_Exhibition_Centre \"Earl's Court Exhibition\nCentre\"), their concert being the final event ever to take place there before\nits demolition. Band member Jamie MacColl introduced Gilmour, saying; \"This\nman gave me my first guitar and was one of the first people to play this venue\nand by my count has played here more than 27 times.\" Gilmour then played with\nthe band on their song \"Rinse Me Down\" before a performance of \"Wish You Were\nHere\".\n\nIn 2005, Waters and [Eric Clapton](/wiki/Eric_Clapton \"Eric Clapton\")\nperformed the song at the [Tsunami Aid](/wiki/Tsunami_Aid \"Tsunami Aid\")\nconcert, and in 2005's [Live 8](/wiki/Live_8 \"Live 8\"), Waters rejoined his\nformer bandmates in London to perform it, along with four other classic Pink\nFloyd songs. Waters sung half the verses during Live 8, while in the original\nversion Gilmour did all the vocals.[14][15]\n\n## Other recorded versions by Pink\nFloyd[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wish_You_Were_Here_\\(Pink_Floyd_song\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Other recorded versions by Pink Floyd\")]\n\n\"Wish You Were Here\" appeared as the fifth track on _[A Collection of Great\nDance Songs](/wiki/A_Collection_of_Great_Dance_Songs \"A Collection of Great\nDance Songs\")_ in 1981 (with the radio intro following the end of a heavily\nedited \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\") and as the 23rd track on the\n_[Echoes](/wiki/Echoes:_The_Best_of_Pink_Floyd \"Echoes: The Best of Pink\nFloyd\")_ compilation[16] in 2001 (with the radio intro following \"[Arnold\nLayne](/wiki/Arnold_Layne \"Arnold Layne\")\", and at the end crossfading with\n\"[Jugband Blues](/wiki/Jugband_Blues \"Jugband Blues\")\").\n\nA live recording included on the 1995 live album\n_[P•U•L•S•E](/wiki/Pulse_\\(Pink_Floyd_album\\) \"Pulse \\(Pink Floyd album\\)\")_\nwas issued as a [single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single\n\\(music\\)\")/[EP](/wiki/Extended_play \"Extended play\"). Its intro replicates\nthe sound of the original, semi-ambient intro. The cover of the EP features\ntwo men whose faces are distorted by fish bowls, referring to the line \"We're\njust two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after
