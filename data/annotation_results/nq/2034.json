The Bell-Wray group had to pay an entry\nfee of $3,500 (equal to $40,230 today) and assumed a total debt of $11,000\nthat was owed to three other NFL franchises.[11] Drawing inspiration from the\n[Blue Eagle](/wiki/Blue_Eagle \"Blue Eagle\") insignia of the [National Recovery\nAdministration](/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration \"National Recovery\nAdministration\")—the centerpiece of President [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\")'s [New\nDeal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\")[11]—Bell and Wray named the new franchise the\nPhiladelphia Eagles. Neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two\nfranchises as the same, citing the aforementioned period of dormancy.\nFurthermore, almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles' first\nroster. The Eagles, along with the [Pittsburgh\nSteelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") and the now-defunct\n[Cincinnati Reds](/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds_\\(NFL\\) \"Cincinnati Reds \\(NFL\\)\"),\njoined the NFL as [expansion teams](/wiki/Expansion_team \"Expansion team\").\n\nIn 1937, the Eagles moved to [Shibe Park](/wiki/Shibe_Park \"Shibe Park\")\n(renamed [Connie Mack Stadium](/wiki/Connie_Mack_Stadium \"Connie Mack\nStadium\") in 1954) and played their home games at the stadium through 1957,\nexcept for the 1941 season, which was played at [Municipal\nStadium](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Stadium_\\(Philadelphia\\) \"John F. Kennedy\nStadium \\(Philadelphia\\)\"), where they had played from 1936 to 1939.\n\n> To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management set up\n> stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20 feet high, these\n> \"east stands\" had 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base\n> line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged capacity of Shibe\n> Park to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25 to 30,000.[12]\n\nThe Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, enduring repeated\nlosing seasons. In December 1940, [Pittsburgh\nSteelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") owner [Art\nRooney](/wiki/Art_Rooney \"Art Rooney\") sold his franchise to [Alexis\nThompson](/wiki/Alexis_Thompson \"Alexis Thompson\") for $160,000 and then used\nhalf of the proceeds to buy a half interest in the Eagles from Bell, his\nlongtime friend.[13] Soon after, Bell and Rooney traded the Eagles franchise\nto Thompson and moved it to Pittsburgh (as the \"Steelers\"), while Thompson\nmoved the Steelers franchise to Philadelphia (as the \"Eagles\").[13]\n\nIn 1943, when manpower shortages stemming from World War II made it impossible\nto fill the roster, the team merged with the Pittsburgh Steelers forming the\n\"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \"[Steagles](/wiki/Steagles\n\"Steagles\").\" (The merger, never intended as a permanent arrangement, was\ndissolved at the end of the [1943 season](/wiki/1943_NFL_season \"1943 NFL\nseason\").) By the late 1940s, head coach [Earle \"Greasy\"\nNeale](/wiki/Greasy_Neale \"Greasy Neale\") and running back [Steve Van\nBuren](/wiki/Steve_Van_Buren \"Steve Van Buren\") led the team to three\nconsecutive NFL Championship Games, winning two of them in\n[1948](/wiki/1948_NFL_season \"1948 NFL season\") and\n[1949](/wiki/1949_NFL_season \"1949 NFL season\"). Those two championships mark\nthe Eagles as the only NFL team ever to win back-to-back championships by\nshutouts, defeating the [Chicago\nCardinals](/wiki/1948_Chicago_Cardinals_season \"1948 Chicago Cardinals\nseason\"), 7–0, in [1948](/wiki/1948_NFL_Championship_Game \"1948 NFL\nChampionship Game\")—in a blizzard—and the [Los Angeles\nRams](/wiki/1949_Los_Angeles_Rams_season \"1949 Los Angeles Rams season\"),\n14–0, in [1949](/wiki/1949_NFL_Championship_Game \"1949 NFL Championship\nGame\").\n\nAfter the [1957 season](/wiki/1957_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"1957\nPhiladelphia Eagles season\"), the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to\n[Franklin Field](/wiki/Franklin_Field \"Franklin Field\") at the University of\nPennsylvania. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles, whereas\nConnie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.[14] The stadium switched from grass to\n[AstroTurf](/wiki/AstroTurf \"AstroTurf\") in 1969. It was the first NFL stadium\nto use artificial turf.\n\nIn [1960](/wiki/1960_NFL_season \"1960 NFL season\"), the Eagles won their\n[third NFL championship](/wiki/1960_NFL_Championship_Game \"1960 NFL\nChampionship Game\"), under the leadership of future [Pro Football Hall of\nFamers](/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame \"Pro Football Hall of Fame\") [Norm Van\nBrocklin](/wiki/Norm_Van_Brocklin \"Norm Van Brocklin\") and [Chuck\nBednarik](/wiki/Chuck_Bednarik \"Chuck Bednarik\"); the head coach was [Buck\nShaw](/wiki/Buck_Shaw \"Buck Shaw\").

From 1999 until 2004, the team\ncontinually improved, going from 5–11 in 1999, returning to the playoffs in\nwith an 11–5 record in 2000, surpassing the Buccaneers in the Wild Card round\nbefore losing in the divisional. Moreover, the Eagles played in four straight\nNFC Championship Games between 2001 and 2004. In\n[2001](/wiki/2001_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2001 Philadelphia Eagles\nseason\"), the Eagles stayed at 11–5, beating the Buccaneers and Bears to\nadvance to the NFC championship, where they lost to the [St. Louis\nRams](/wiki/2001_St._Louis_Rams_season \"2001 St. Louis Rams season\").

In\n[2003](/wiki/2003_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2003 Philadelphia Eagles\nseason\"), they won the NFC first seed, but Westbrook went down in Week 17,\nculminating in a loss to the [Carolina\nPanthers](/wiki/2003_Carolina_Panthers_season \"2003 Carolina Panthers season\")\nin their 3rd straight NFC Championship.\n\n##### 2004 Season and Super Bowl XXXIX\n\nIn [2004](/wiki/2004_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2004 Philadelphia Eagles\nseason\"), the Philadelphia Eagles had their best season since 1960, going 13–1\nbefore resting their starters and losing their next 2, clinching the 1st seed\nfor the second year in a row. McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his\npasses for 3,875 yards, though he didn't play all 16 games. McNabb became the\nfirst quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10\ninterceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he\nhad a reliable receiver, [Terrell Owens](/wiki/Terrell_Owens \"Terrell Owens\"),\nwho got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After beating the Vikings\nand Falcons the Eagles advanced to [Super Bowl XXXIX](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIX\n\"Super Bowl XXXIX\"), where they dueled the [New England\nPatriots](/wiki/2004_New_England_Patriots_season \"2004 New England Patriots\nseason\").

McNabb had played with\na sports hernia and a broken thumb, starting 4–2 but losing three in a row,\nbefore McNabb finally succumbs to injury and is out for the rest of the\nseason. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended\nafter 7 games, eventually being cut. In\n[2006](/wiki/2006_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2006 Philadelphia Eagles\nseason\"), the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil, but\nWestbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under\nCoach Reid, with a 10–6 record and a win in the wild card round, but they had\nan 8–8 2007 season. In [2008](/wiki/2008_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2008\nPhiladelphia Eagles season\"), the team won their 500th game, and they also\ndrafted [DeSean Jackson](/wiki/DeSean_Jackson \"DeSean Jackson\"), a receiving\nthreat when paired with McNabb.[21]\n\nOn January 11, 2009, the team defeated the defending Super Bowl champion and\n1st seed [New York Giants](/wiki/2008_New_York_Giants_season \"2008 New York\nGiants season\") 23–11 en route to their 5th NFC Championship Game in 8 years\nand 5th in the 10 years the Eagles have been coached by Andy Reid. In the 2008\nNFC Championship Game, the Eagles made a rally, going from 24–6 at halftime to\n25–24 with three minutes left in the 4th, but they lost to the [Arizona\nCardinals](/wiki/2008_Arizona_Cardinals_season \"2008 Arizona Cardinals\nseason\") by a score of 32–25 after quarterback [Kurt Warner](/wiki/Kurt_Warner\n\"Kurt Warner\") scored a last minute touchdown. As of the conclusion of the\n2016 season, during the Lurie era, the Eagles are 1–4 in conference\nchampionship games and 0–1 in Super Bowls.\n\nOn August 13, 2009, the Eagles signed quarterback [Michael\nVick](/wiki/Michael_Vick \"Michael Vick\").[22] On December 6, 2009, [Andy\nReid](/wiki/Andy_Reid \"Andy Reid\") became only the 5th coach in NFL history to\nwin 100 or more games with a single team in a single decade. The other four\nare [Tom Landry](/wiki/Tom_Landry \"Tom Landry\"), [Don Shula](/wiki/Don_Shula\n\"Don Shula\"), [Tony Dungy](/wiki/Tony_Dungy \"Tony Dungy\"), and [Bill\nBelichick](/wiki/Bill_Belichick \"Bill Belichick\"), all Super Bowl winners.[23]\nMcNabb finally had a complete receiving corps, between first round draft pick\n[Jeremy Maclin](/wiki/Jeremy_Maclin \"Jeremy Maclin\"), DeSean Jackson's 1,000\nyard season, and [Brent Celek](/wiki/Brent_Celek \"Brent Celek\") ranking among\nthe top 5 tight ends in the league. Without Brian Dawkins, defensive end\n[Trent Cole](/wiki/Trent_Cole \"Trent Cole\") stepped up and became the dominant\nforce on defense with 12 sacks, earning him his second trip to the Pro Bowl\nand All-Pro honors. In 2009, the Eagles started 5–4, but moved up to 11–4, and\ncould clinch the NFC 2nd seed if they won their next game. After a shutout at\nthe hands of the Dallas Cowboys in week 17, the Eagles missed the 1st round\nbye. but with a record of 11–5, but they were the NFC 6th seed and they\nnarrowly made the playoffs. In the 2009 NFC Wild Card Game, the Eagles played\nagainst the Cowboys for the second consecutive week and lost 34–14. Despite\nmany errors from many players, and a great season before the breakdown in\nDallas, McNabb took the brunt of the blow and was heavily criticized. Coach\nAndy Reid said up until April 1, 2010, that McNabb would remain the starter.\n\nOn March 5, 2010, [Brian Westbrook](/wiki/Brian_Westbrook \"Brian Westbrook\")\nwas cut from the Eagles after eight seasons with the team. On April 4, 2010,\nthe team traded long-time starting quarterback [Donovan\nMcNabb](/wiki/Donovan_McNabb \"Donovan McNabb\") to the [Washington\nRedskins](/wiki/Washington_Redskins \"Washington Redskins\") in exchange for a\nsecond round draft pick.[24] [Kevin Kolb](/wiki/Kevin_Kolb \"Kevin Kolb\") was\nimmediately named the starter, but after suffering a concussion in week 1\nagainst the Packers, Vick took over as the starter. Vick led the Eagles to its\nsixth NFC East division title in ten seasons. With a record of 10–6 the Eagles\nclinched the 3rd seed and had to play a Wild Card Playoff Game. During the\n2010 NFC Wild Card Game, the Eagles faced off against the eventual Super Bowl\nchampion [Green Bay Packers](/wiki/2010_Green_Bay_Packers_season \"2010 Green\nBay Packers season\") and lost 21–16.\n\nThe [2011 season](/wiki/2011_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2011 Philadelphia\nEagles season\") for the Eagles was a major disappointment, as they only\nmanaged to finish 8–8 and did not qualify for the playoffs, although they did\nwin the last 4 games of the season. Because of several free agent\nacquisitions, [Vince Young](/wiki/Vince_Young \"Vince Young\"), a back up\nquarterback, stated that the Eagles were a Dream Team. The Philadelphia fan\nbase and faithful never did concur with the comment as some national outlets\nmay comment. Many Eagles fans believe that Vince Young saying that the Eagles\nwere a 'Dream Team' is the reason that the Eagles had such a horrible season.\n\nEagles fans had high expectations going into the [2012\nseason](/wiki/2012_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2012 Philadelphia Eagles\nseason\"). The Eagles started off winning three out of their four first games,\nbut that changed when they lost the next eight games, and were eliminated from\nthe playoff hunt. They only won one out of their last four games. After a loss\nto the [New York Giants](/wiki/New_York_Giants \"New York Giants\") on December\n30, 2012, longtime head coach [Andy Reid](/wiki/Andy_Reid \"Andy Reid\") was\nfired after fourteen seasons with the team.[25]\n\n#### Chip Kelly era (2013–2015)\n\nOn January 16, 2013, the Eagles brought in University of Oregon head coach\n[Chip Kelly](/wiki/Chip_Kelly \"Chip Kelly\") to succeed Reid as head coach\nafter a 4–12 season.[26] The Philadelphia Eagles named Michael Vick starting\nquarterback going into the 2013 season with much promise running Chip Kelly's\nfast-paced spread offense.\n\nThe 2013 season proved to be more successful for the Eagles. A hamstring\ninjury took Michael Vick out after a 1–3 start, but his backup, Nick Foles,\nled the team to a 10–6 regular season record, and its seventh NFC East title\nin 13 seasons. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles threw\n19 touchdowns, which was just one shy of the all-time NFL record of\nconsecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier\nin the season by [Peyton Manning](/wiki/Peyton_Manning \"Peyton Manning\").\nFoles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single-game with seven\nagainst the [Oakland Raiders](/wiki/Oakland_Raiders \"Oakland Raiders\") which\nalso made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw that many touchdowns\nin a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only\n2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That\nrecord was later broken by [Tom Brady](/wiki/Tom_Brady \"Tom Brady\"), in the\n2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third highest in\nleague history behind only [Aaron Rodgers](/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers \"Aaron\nRodgers\") in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second\nquarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards\nand a perfect passer rating. [LeSean McCoy](/wiki/LeSean_McCoy \"LeSean McCoy\")\nfinished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing\nyards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also\nbest in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in\nfranchise history passing the previous season high set back in 1948.\n\nThe Eagles opened the 2014 season winning their first three games and making\nNFL history as the only team ever to trail by ten or more points in their\nfirst three games and come back to win.[27] Nick Foles struggled with\nturnovers, but ultimately did well and led the Eagles to a 6–2 record, before\nbreaking his collarbone, resulting in his job getting taken over by [Mark\nSanchez](/wiki/Mark_Sanchez \"Mark Sanchez\"), who outplayed Foles despite\nfacing more playoff teams. The Eagles held the divisional title from week one\nto week 15 against the Cowboys. After going 9–3 with their crucial win over\nthe Cowboys, the Eagles lost their next 3, and a week after losing the NFC\nEast title, they lost an upset against the 3–11 Redskins and were eliminated\nfrom playoff contention with the Cowboys' win over the Colts.\n\nFollowing the 2014 season, Chip Kelly was given total control and made some\ncontroversial moves. He traded [LeSean McCoy](/wiki/LeSean_McCoy \"LeSean\nMcCoy\"), who had become the team's all-time leading rusher after the 2014\nseason, for linebacker [Kiko Alonso](/wiki/Kiko_Alonso \"Kiko Alonso\"), a\nplayer Kelly coached at Oregon who had missed the entire 2014 season.[28] He\nalso cut ten-year veteran and starter, Trent Cole, who was still a consistent\nthreat on defense and was second only to legend [Reggie\nWhite](/wiki/Reggie_White \"Reggie White\") on the Eagles all-time sack\nlist.[29] He also made a trade where the highly successful [Nick\nFoles](/wiki/Nick_Foles \"Nick Foles\") was traded for [Sam\nBradford](/wiki/Sam_Bradford \"Sam Bradford\"), who had missed the entire 2014\nseason with an ACL tear.[30] Kelly tried to re-sign Jeremy Maclin, who had\nstepped up as the team's leading wide receiver, but he signed with the [Kansas\nCity Chiefs](/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs \"Kansas City Chiefs\") instead. However,\nthe Eagles also acquired league leading rusher [DeMarco\nMurray](/wiki/DeMarco_Murray \"DeMarco Murray\"),[31] which not only helped the\nEagles, but hurt their rivals, the Dallas Cowboys. They also obtained Super\nBowl champion [Byron Maxwell](/wiki/Byron_Maxwell \"Byron Maxwell\"),[32] who\nleft the Seattle Seahawks in free agency to sign a six-year, $63 million\ncontract. The first two games of the season were disastrous, as they started\n0–2. Bradford had a 2–4 TD-INT ratio, Maxwell was constantly beaten by Falcons\nreceiver [Julio Jones](/wiki/Julio_Jones \"Julio Jones\"), and Murray was held\nto 11 yards on 21 carries. After Murray was injured, [Ryan\nMathews](/wiki/Ryan_Mathews_\\(American_football\\) \"Ryan Mathews \\(American\nfootball\\)\") rushed for over 100 yards in a Week 3 win against the New York\nJets. Kelly made Murray the unquestioned starter and although Murray's play\nimproved over the season, he never regained his dominant form and was held to\na career low 3.6 yards per carry average.\n\nOn December 29, 2015, with one game left in the season, head coach Chip Kelly\nwas released by the Eagles. Offensive Coordinator Pat Shurmur was named\nInterim Coach for the final game against the rival New York Giants, which\nShurmur won 35–30.[33] Former player and current running backs coach [Duce\nStaley](/wiki/Duce_Staley \"Duce Staley\") was the first coach to be interviewed\nfor the opening head coaching job on January 2, 2016.[34]\n\n#### Doug Pederson era (2016–present)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Carson_wentz_2016.jpg/220px-\nCarson_wentz_2016.jpg)](/wiki/File:Carson_wentz_2016.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Carson_wentz_2016.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Carson Wentz](/wiki/Carson_Wentz \"Carson Wentz\") made his debut in the [2016\nseason](/wiki/2016_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2016 Philadelphia Eagles\nseason\")\n\nThe Eagles hired [Chiefs](/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs \"Kansas City Chiefs\")\n[offensive coordinator](/wiki/Offensive_coordinator \"Offensive coordinator\")\n[Doug Pederson](/wiki/Doug_Pederson \"Doug Pederson\") as their next head coach.\nThe team made the official announcement on January 18, 2016.

All of these\n> factors were what initially attracted us to Doug and we believe that he is\n> the right man to help us achieve our ultimate goal.\"\n\nPederson had been with the Chiefs for the preceding three years after spending\nthe four seasons previous to those with the Eagles. He served as a quality\ncontrol assistant for the Eagles in 2009 and 2010 before being promoted to\nquarterbacks coach for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. He was praised for his work\nwith Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith over the preceding few seasons,\nparticularly 2015, as the Chiefs moved into the top 10 in scoring\noffense.[35][36]\n\nAt the end of the 2015 season, the Eagles had the 13th pick in the [2016 NFL\nDraft](/wiki/2016_NFL_Draft \"2016 NFL Draft\"). They traded [Byron\nMaxwell](/wiki/Byron_Maxwell \"Byron Maxwell\"), [Kiko Alonso](/wiki/Kiko_Alonso\n\"Kiko Alonso\"), and their pick to the [Miami Dolphins](/wiki/Miami_Dolphins\n\"Miami Dolphins\") for the #8 pick. Later, they traded the #8 pick, their\nthird-round pick, their fourth-round pick, a 2017 first-round pick, and a 2018\nsecond-round pick to the [Cleveland Browns](/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland\nBrowns\") for the #2 pick and a 2017 fourth-round pick. They used the #2 pick\nto draft [North Dakota State](/wiki/North_Dakota_State_Bison_football \"North\nDakota State Bison football\") quarterback [Carson Wentz](/wiki/Carson_Wentz\n\"Carson Wentz\"). On September 3, 2016, the Eagles traded starting quarterback\n[Sam Bradford](/wiki/Sam_Bradford \"Sam Bradford\") to the [Minnesota\nVikings](/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings \"Minnesota Vikings\"), who had lost [Teddy\nBridgewater](/wiki/Teddy_Bridgewater \"Teddy Bridgewater\") for the season, for\na 2017 first-round pick and a 2018 fourth-round pick. Following the trade, the\nEagles named Wentz the starting quarterback for Week 1 of the 2016 season.[37]\nFirst-time head coach Pederson led the Eagles to a 3–0 start to the season.\nHis rookie quarterback started with 5 touchdowns, no interceptions and over\n255 yards per game. The Week 4 bye took a toll on the Eagles, and they lost\nfour out of the next five games, including a loss to every rival team in their\ndivision. They also lost right tackle [Lane Johnson](/wiki/Lane_Johnson \"Lane\nJohnson\") to a 10-game suspension following the Week 5 loss againist the Lions\nwhich damaged Carson Wentz's hot start. In those four games, their average\nmargin of loss was just under 5 points.[38] Pederson and the Eagles won just 3\nof their last 7 games. Those included gruesome road losses against the\n[Seattle Seahawks](/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks \"Seattle Seahawks\"), the [Cincinnati\nBengals](/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals \"Cincinnati Bengals\"), and the [Baltimore\nRavens](/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens \"Baltimore Ravens\"). Although Wentz started off\nthe season well, the 6–5 quarterback finished with a TD–INT ratio of 16:14.\nThe rookie head coach and rookie quarterback tandem led the Eagles to a\ndisappointing year, finishing with a 7–9 record and coming in last in the\ndivision.\n\n##### 2017: First Super Bowl championship\n\nDuring the following offseason, the team made several acquisitions on the\noffensive side of the ball. The Eagles either traded or released notable\nplayers from the [Chip Kelly](/wiki/Chip_Kelly \"Chip Kelly\") era like [Ryan\nMathews](/wiki/Ryan_Mathews_\\(American_football\\) \"Ryan Mathews \\(American\nfootball\\)\"), [Matt Tobin](/wiki/Matt_Tobin \"Matt Tobin\"), [Allen\nBarbre](/wiki/Allen_Barbre \"Allen Barbre\"), [Jordan\nMatthews](/wiki/Jordan_Matthews \"Jordan Matthews\") and [Marcus Smith\nII](/wiki/Marcus_Smith_II \"Marcus Smith II\"). They signed more notable players\nto improve its wide receiver corps that have struggled the last two seasons\nlike [Alshon Jeffery](/wiki/Alshon_Jeffery \"Alshon Jeffery\"), and [Torrey\nSmith](/wiki/Torrey_Smith \"Torrey Smith\") as well as 2016 Super Bowl champion,\n[Legarrette Blount](/wiki/Legarrette_Blount \"Legarrette Blount\"). They also\nadded veterans on defense such as [Patrick\nRobinson](/wiki/Patrick_Robinson_\\(cornerback\\) \"Patrick Robinson\n\\(cornerback\\)\"), [Chris Long](/wiki/Chris_Long \"Chris Long\"), [Corey\nGraham](/wiki/Corey_Graham \"Corey Graham\"), [Tim Jernigan](/wiki/Tim_Jernigan\n\"Tim Jernigan\") and [Ronald Darby](/wiki/Ronald_Darby \"Ronald Darby\"). The\nteam addressed its defense mostly in the draft, using its top three picks on\ndefensive players. The Eagles drafted [Derek Barnett](/wiki/Derek_Barnett\n\"Derek Barnett\") with the 14th overall pick. The Eagles had completely\nrevamped their offense and strengthened their defense heading into the 2017\nseason. They opened the season on the road versus the [Washington\nRedskins](/wiki/Washington_Redskins \"Washington Redskins\") and won the game\n30–17. The team lost to the [Kansas City Chiefs](/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs\n\"Kansas City Chiefs\") the following week, 27–20, in Pederson's return to face\n[Andy Reid](/wiki/Andy_Reid \"Andy Reid\"). The Eagles then won six consecutive\ngames, including signature wins at the [Carolina\nPanthers](/wiki/Carolina_Panthers \"Carolina Panthers\"), 28–23, and versus the\n[Washington Redskins](/wiki/Washington_Redskins \"Washington Redskins\"), 34–24,\nin a Monday Night contest. On the morning of October 31, 2017, just before the\nNFL trade deadline, the Eagles made a blockbuster move sending a fourth-round\npick to the [Miami Dolphins](/wiki/Miami_Dolphins \"Miami Dolphins\") for star\nrunning back [Jay Ajayi](/wiki/Jay_Ajayi \"Jay Ajayi\"). The move immediately\npaid dividends for the Eagles heading into their next game versus the [Denver\nBroncos](/wiki/Denver_Broncos \"Denver Broncos\") as Ajayi rushed for 77 yards\non just eight attempts including a 46-yard TD near the end of the second\nquarter. Ajayi and Wentz led the Eagles to a 51–23 rout of the top defense in\nthe NFL.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Nick_Foles_Super_bowl_LII_pregame_huddle.jpg/206px-\nNick_Foles_Super_bowl_LII_pregame_huddle.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nick_Foles_Super_bowl_LII_pregame_huddle.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nick_Foles_Super_bowl_LII_pregame_huddle.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFoles in the Huddle before leaving the field before [Super Bowl\nLII](//commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_LII&action=edit&redlink=1).\n\nThe Eagles headed into their bye week with the best record in the NFL (8–1),\nand with Wentz leading the NFL MVP discussion with an NFL-leading 23\ntouchdowns to 5 interceptions. During their bye, the Eagles signed former\nGiants offensive tackle [Will Beatty](/wiki/Will_Beatty \"Will Beatty\") and\nformer Saints linebacker [Dannell Ellerbe](/wiki/Dannell_Ellerbe \"Dannell\nEllerbe\") to not only add depth but also players with Super Bowl experiences.\nComing off of the bye week, the Philadelphia Eagles entered a Sunday night\nshowdown with the defending NFC East champion [Dallas\nCowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\"). The Eagles came out sluggish\nand trailed 9–7 at the half. The team exploded in the second half though,\nrattling off 30 unanswered points to soundly defeat their rival by a final\nscore of 37–9. The Eagles were rolling on a nine-game winning streak after a\nhuge blowout win over the [Chicago Bears](/wiki/Chicago_Bears \"Chicago\nBears\").[28] The Eagles traveled to Seattle in Week 13 in a huge Sunday Night\nshowdown against [Russell Wilson](/wiki/Russell_Wilson \"Russell Wilson\") and\nthe [Seattle Seahawks](/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks \"Seattle Seahawks\"). The Eagles\nstruggled throughout the whole game, blowing many scoring opportunities and\nallowing Wilson to throw 3 touchdowns. The Eagles lost 24–10, ending their win\nstreak. However, the Eagles bounced back in Week 14 win over the [Los Angeles\nRams](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams \"Los Angeles Rams\") in a tough 43–35 win.\nHowever, Carson Wentz left the game in the third quarter with a knee injury.\nIt was later found out that Wentz tore his ACL, ending his MVP caliber season.\nBackup [Nick Foles](/wiki/Nick_Foles \"Nick Foles\") would once again take over\nas starting quarterback. In Foles's first start against the New York Giants,\nhe would lead them back from a 20–7 deficit and score 4 touchdowns and win the\ngame 34–29. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the\n[Oakland Raiders](/wiki/Oakland_Raiders \"Oakland Raiders\") and the [Dallas\nCowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\"), and threw a touchdown and 2\ninterceptions in that span. Despite this, the Eagles finished 13–3 and secured\nthe top seed in the NFC. The Eagles opened as the underdogs, the first time in\nhistory that a No. 1 seed has opened up the postseason as an underdog. Despite\nthis, Foles would lead the Eagles past the [Atlanta\nFalcons](/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons \"Atlanta Falcons\") in the Divisional Round\n15–10. In the next game Foles and the Eagles annihilated the [Minnesota\nVikings](/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings \"Minnesota Vikings\") 38–7 in the NFC\nChampionship nicknamed the Minneapolis Massacre, mocking the Minneapolis\nMiracle from their previous playoff victory. Foles had his best game since\nweek 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and 3 touchdowns including an\nimpressive flea flicker touchdown pass. This win marked the franchise's third\nSuper Bowl appearance and a berth in [Super Bowl LII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_LII\n\"Super Bowl LII\") for a 2005 rematch against [Tom Brady](/wiki/Tom_Brady \"Tom\nBrady\") and the [New England Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England\nPatriots\").\n\nWith Foles at the helm, the Eagles started off the game strong, leading the\nPatriots 22–12 at halftime. In the second half the Patriots gained momentum\nand for the first time took the lead in the 4th quarter 33–32. The Eagles\nrallied back and scored an 11-yard Touchdown to tight end [Zach\nErtz](/wiki/Zach_Ertz \"Zach Ertz\"). Later the Eagles converted on a 46-yard\nfield goal by [Jake Elliott](/wiki/Jake_Elliott \"Jake Elliott\") to lead 41–33.\nOn the final play of the game with 9 seconds left, Brady threw a hail-mary\npass directed toward tight end [Rob Gronkowski](/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski \"Rob\nGronkowski\") which was bobbled by Patrick Robinson before being dropped in the\nend-zone as time expired, securing the win for the Eagles 41–33, and ending\nthe 58-year long championship drought. This would be Philadelphia's first\nSuper Bowl win and their fourth league championship (their first championship\nsince [1960](/wiki/1960 \"1960\")). Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28–43 with\n373 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and an interception. [Nick\nFoles](/wiki/Nick_Foles \"Nick Foles\") became the first backup quarterback to\nstart and win a Super Bowl since his opponent [Tom Brady](/wiki/Tom_Brady \"Tom\nBrady\") won as the backup for [Drew Bledsoe](/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe \"Drew\nBledsoe\") in [2001](/wiki/2001 \"2001\").\n\n## Season records\n\nMain article: [List of Philadelphia Eagles\nseasons](/wiki/List_of_Philadelphia_Eagles_seasons \"List of Philadelphia\nEagles seasons\")\n\n  * Regular season record (all-time): 568–594–26\n  * Playoff record (all-time): 22–21 (last appearance after beating New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII)\n  * Most points in a season: 474 points (2014)\n  * NFL championships won: 4 (3 before the 1967 NFL-AFL merger created the Super Bowl)\n  * Super Bowls won: 1 out of 3 appearances\n  * Passing leader (all-time): Donovan McNabb – 32,873 yards\n  * Rushing leader (all-time): LeSean McCoy – 6,792 yards\n  * Receiving leader (all-time): Harold Carmichael – 8,978 yards\n  * Winningest coach (all-time): Andy Reid – 130 wins\n  * Top player by approximate value (all-time): Donovan McNabb – 126 AV\n\n## Rivalries\n\n### New York Giants\n\nMain article: [Eagles–Giants rivalry](/wiki/Eagles%E2%80%93Giants_rivalry\n\"Eagles–Giants rivalry\")\n\nOne of the NFL's oldest, this rivalry began on October 15, 1933[39] when the\nGiants defeated the newly founded Eagles 56–0. The Giants lead the all-time\nseries 84–82–2. Three of the best known comebacks against the Giants are\nlabeled as \"Miracle In The Meadowlands – Herm Edwards\", \"Miracle In The\nMeadowlands II – Brian Westbrook\" and \"Miracle In The New Meadowlands – DeSean\nJackson\".\n\n### Dallas Cowboys\n\nMain article: [Cowboys–Eagles rivalry](/wiki/Cowboys%E2%80%93Eagles_rivalry\n\"Cowboys–Eagles rivalry\")\n\nThe Cowboys have been one of the Eagles' biggest rivals. The Eagles won the\nfirst game in this rivalry 27–25 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-\ntime series 63–51–0. They have been close in recent years, with Dallas winning\n12 games from 2006 to the present while the Eagles have also won 12. There is\nmuch hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the\n1989 [Bounty Bowl](/wiki/Bounty_Bowl \"Bounty Bowl\").\n\n### Washington Redskins\n\nMain article: [Eagles–Redskins rivalry](/wiki/Eagles%E2%80%93Redskins_rivalry\n\"Eagles–Redskins rivalry\")\n\nNot as big as the rivalries between the Giants and Cowboys, that with division\nrivals Washington Redskins is still fierce. It started in 1934 when the\nWashington Redskins were first known as the Boston Redskin; the Redskins\ndefeated the Eagles 6–0, and lead the all-time series 85–76–6. The rivalry has\nbeen very even since 2010 overall. However, the Eagles swept the Redskins\nduring the 2017 season for the first time since the 2013 season.\n\n### Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nMain article: [Eagles–Steelers rivalry](/wiki/Eagles%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry\n\"Eagles–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nThe Eagles and [Pittsburgh Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh\nSteelers\") are both located in [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania\n\"Pennsylvania\") and began play in 1933. From that season, through 1966, this\nwas a major rivalry for both teams as both were part of the same division. In\n1967, they were placed in separate divisions but remained in the same\nconference for three years. Finally, in 1970, the Steelers (along with the\n[Cleveland Browns](/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland Browns\") and [Baltimore\nColts](/wiki/Baltimore_Colts \"Baltimore Colts\")) moved to the [American\nFootball Conference](/wiki/American_Football_Conference \"American Football\nConference\") while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams\nin the [National Football Conference](/wiki/National_Football_Conference\n\"National Football Conference\"). As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no\nlonger played each other every year. Currently they are scheduled to meet once\nevery four years in the regular season, the most recent meeting being in 2016\nat Philadelphia, with the Eagles winning 34-3. The Steelers have lost nine\nstraight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was\nalso the start of the [Super Bowl](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\") era. The\nEagles lead the all-time series 47–28–3.\n\n## Logo and uniforms\n\n    _See also:[Uniform (American football)](/wiki/Uniform_\\(American_football\\) \"Uniform \\(American football\\)\") and footnote about Eagles' uniform numbers._[40]\n\nFor several decades, the Eagles' [colors](/wiki/Away_colours \"Away colours\")\nwere [kelly green](/wiki/Kelly_green \"Kelly green\"), silver, and white. In\n1954, the Eagles, along with the [Baltimore Colts](/wiki/Baltimore_Colts\n\"Baltimore Colts\"), became the second team ever in the NFL to put a\n[logo](/wiki/Logo#Sports \"Logo\") on their [helmets](/wiki/Football_helmet\n\"Football helmet\"), with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969, the\nteam wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and\nwhite with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white\nhelmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly\ngreen helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the\nsilver wings took on a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet\nbecame standard for over two decades.\n\nFrom 1948–95, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its\nclaws, although from '69–72, the eagle took on a more stylized look. As the\ndesign was similar to the _[Apollo 11](/wiki/Apollo_11 \"Apollo 11\")_ emblem,\nand its [moon-landing craft](/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module \"Apollo Lunar Module\")\nwas dubbed _Eagle_ , players wore the flight's mission patch on their jerseys\nduring 1969.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn 1973, the team's name was added below the eagle, which returned to its\npre-'69 look.\n\nHowever, both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996. The\nprimary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described\nas \"midnight green.\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved\nto either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed\nto a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo\ncombination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed in 1996, with the\neagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic,\nmore cartoon-based style, and the lettering changing from calligraphic to\nblock letters.\n\nSince the 1996 alterations, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly\nrelating to jersey/pant combinations worn during specific games. For example,\nin 1997, against the [San Francisco\n49ers](/wiki/1997_San_Francisco_49ers_season \"1997 San Francisco 49ers\nseason\"), the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only\ntwo occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the\nfinal regular season game at [Veterans Stadium](/wiki/Veterans_Stadium\n\"Veterans Stadium\"), a win over the division-rival [Washington\nRedskins](/wiki/2002_Washington_Redskins_season \"2002 Washington Redskins\nseason\"). A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home\nlosses to the [Tampa Bay Buccaneers](/wiki/2003_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season\n\"2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season\") and [New England\nPatriots](/wiki/2003_New_England_Patriots_season \"2003 New England Patriots\nseason\")), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. Since 2003, the\nwhite jerseys along with white pants have been worn during preseason games.\n\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though only subtle) change to the\n1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver\ntrim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants\nchanged from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and\nfrom a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one\nsmall white stripe in between for the midnight blue pants. The 2003 season\nalso saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of\nblack) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been\nworn for two selected [home](/wiki/Home_\\(sports\\) \"Home \\(sports\\)\") games\neach season (usually the first home game after [bye](/wiki/Bye_\\(sports\\) \"Bye\n\\(sports\\)\") week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular season\nhome finales, the team wore the green [road](/wiki/Road_\\(sports\\) \"Road\n\\(sports\\)\") pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost each game. Since\nthen, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants.\nHowever, due to the special 75th anniversary uniforms serving as the\n\"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate\nblack jersey that season per league rules (alternate uniforms are permitted\ntwice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white\npants, however, re-appeared for the 2008\n[Thanksgiving](/wiki/NFL_on_Thanksgiving_Day \"NFL on Thanksgiving Day\") night\ngame against the [Arizona Cardinals](/wiki/2008_Arizona_Cardinals_season \"2008\nArizona Cardinals season\"). The black jerseys were most recently used in a\nDecember 21, 2016 game against the [New York Giants](/wiki/New_York_Giants\n\"New York Giants\"), in which they won 24-19. From 2006–2013, the Eagles have\nonly worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November\nhome game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010\nseasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates\nfor their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing\nblack shoes exclusively in 2004. Since 2014, the Eagles have worn the black\njersey twice per season. In 2016, they wore the black jersey three times.\n\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-\nseason logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore\n[\"throwback\" jerseys](/wiki/Throwback_uniform \"Throwback uniform\") in a 2007\ngame against the [Detroit Lions](/wiki/2007_Detroit_Lions_season \"2007 Detroit\nLions season\"). The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on\n[Philadelphia's city flag](/wiki/Flag_of_Philadelphia \"Flag of Philadelphia\"),\nare based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural\nseason, and were the same colors used by the former [Frankford Yellow\nJackets](/wiki/Frankford_Yellow_Jackets \"Frankford Yellow Jackets\") franchise\nprior to their suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit,\n56–21.[41]\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games\nand daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to\nmid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first\nhalf of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since\nthe temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the\nhome opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington\nRedskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in\nNovember, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they have\ndone it earlier before), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey.\nOn one occasion the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting\nagainst the [Dallas Cowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\") on\nNovember 4, 2007 to make the Cowboys wear their road blue jerseys. Since\nmoving to [Lincoln Financial Field](/wiki/Lincoln_Financial_Field \"Lincoln\nFinancial Field\") in 2003, the Eagles have worn white at home for at least\ntheir home opener, with the exceptions for the 2010 home opener (_see next\nparagraph_), the 2011 home opener against the [New York\nGiants](/wiki/2011_New_York_Giants_season \"2011 New York Giants season\"), the\n2016 home opener against the [Cleveland\nBrowns](/wiki/2016_Cleveland_Browns_season \"2016 Cleveland Browns season\"),\nand the 2017 home opener against the Giants.\n\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the\nEagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960\nchampionship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.[42] In weeks 4\nand 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up\nagainst the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons respectively before\nreverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\nFor the 2011 season, the Eagles did not wear white for any of their home\ngames.\n\nFor the 2012 season [Nike](/wiki/Nike,_Inc. \"Nike, Inc.\") took over from\n[Reebok](/wiki/Reebok \"Reebok\") as the NFL's official apparel licensee but the\nEagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \"Elite 51\" uniform\ntechnology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other\nchange is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing\nthe NFL Equipment logo), other than that the uniforms essentially remain\nunchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey.\n\nFor the 2013 season, the Eagles started to wear white pants, as an alternate\nto their green pants, with their white jerseys, in the regular season.\n\nFor the 2014 season the Eagles have officially adopted the \"Elite 51″ style\nuniform from Nike. Recently the team has discussed bringing back the \"Kelly\nGreen\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship\nseason and which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay.\nTraditionally kelly green, silver and white had been the official team color\nuntil 1996 season when it switched to the current \"Midnight Green\" uniforms.\nBut due to the NFL rules and restrictions having a team go through a waiting\nperiod before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, it would\nmost likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\n\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants\nto complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set, the\nEagles won the game 27–0. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. The\nblackout uniform was most recently worn in a Week 16 victory, 19-10, against\nthe Raiders in 2017. The Eagles are 6–3 in their blackout uniforms: winning\nthree times against the Giants and once against each of the [Minnesota\nVikings](/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings \"Minnesota Vikings\"), [Denver\nBroncos](/wiki/Denver_Broncos \"Denver Broncos\"), and Oakland Raiders, and\nlosing against the [Seattle Seahawks](/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks \"Seattle\nSeahawks\"), [Arizona Cardinals](/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals \"Arizona Cardinals\"),\nand [Green Bay Packers](/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers \"Green Bay Packers\").\n\n## Training camp\n\nThe Eagles previously held their preseason training camp from the end of July\nthrough mid-August each year at [Lehigh University](/wiki/Lehigh_University\n\"Lehigh University\") in [Bethlehem,\nPennsylvania](/wiki/Bethlehem,_Pennsylvania \"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania\") in the\n[Lehigh Valley](/wiki/Lehigh_Valley \"Lehigh Valley\").[43] With the addition of\nnew head coach [Chip Kelly](/wiki/Chip_Kelly \"Chip Kelly\"), the Eagles\nrecently moved their training camp to the [NovaCare\nComplex](/wiki/NovaCare_Complex \"NovaCare Complex\") in\n[Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\").[44][45] Training camps

\"Enlarge\")\n\nEagles fans celebrating along [Benjamin Franklin\nParkway](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_Parkway \"Benjamin Franklin Parkway\") at the\nEagles victory parade\n\n### Devotion\n\nAlthough the method may vary, studies that attempt to rank the 32 fan bases in\nthe NFL consistently place Eagles [fans](/wiki/Sports_fan \"Sports fan\") among\nthe best in the league, noting their \"unmatched fervor.\"[46] Eagles fans have\nnumerous dedicated web communities, ranking the Eagles just behind the\nPhillies as the dominant Philadelphia sports presence on the web.[47]\n\nThe [American City Business Journals](/wiki/American_City_Business_Journals\n\"American City Business Journals\"), which conducts a regular study to\ndetermine the most loyal fans in the NFL, evaluates fans based primarily on\nattendance-related factors,[48] and ranked Eagles fans third in both 1999[49]\nand 2006.[50] The 2006 study called the fans \"incredibly loyal\", noting that\nthey filled 99.8% of the seats in the stadium over the previous decade.[51]\n_[Forbes](/wiki/Forbes \"Forbes\")_ placed the Eagles fans first in its 2008\nsurvey,[52] which was based on the correlation between team performance and\nfan attendance.[53] [ESPN.com](/wiki/ESPN.com \"ESPN.com\") placed Eagles fans\nfourth in the league in its 2008 survey, citing the connection between the\nteam's performance and the mood of the city.[54] The last home game which was\nblacked out on television in the Philadelphia market as a result of not being\nsold out was against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, September 12, 1999,\nwhich was Andy Reid's first home game as new head coach of the\nEagles.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nThe studies note that—win or lose—Eagles fans can be counted on to pack their\nstadium. As of August 2008, the team had sold out 71 consecutive games, and\n70,000 were on the team's waiting list for season tickets.[54] Despite\nfinishing with a 6–10 record in the 2005 season, the Eagles ranked second in\nthe NFL in merchandise sales, and single-game tickets for the next season were\nsold out minutes after phone and Internet lines opened.[55]\n\nEagles fans have also been known to chant the famous, \"E-A-G-L-E-S – Eagles!!\"\nat [Flyers](/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers \"Philadelphia Flyers\"),\n[Phillies](/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies \"Philadelphia Phillies\"), and\n[76ers](/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers \"Philadelphia 76ers\") games when the team is\ngetting [blown out](/wiki/Blowout_\\(sports\\) \"Blowout \\(sports\\)\") late in a\ngame and a loss is inevitable, signifying their displeasure with the given\nteam's performance, and that they are instead putting their hope into the\nEagles.\n\n### Bad behavior\n\nAlong with their [fierce devotion](/wiki/Ultras \"Ultras\"), Eagles fans have [a\nreputation for bad behavior](/wiki/Hooliganism \"Hooliganism\") and [sports-\nrelated violence](/wiki/Violence_in_sports \"Violence in sports\"), especially\nwhen the team plays its rivals.[56] In _If Football 's a Religion, Why Don't\nWe Have a Prayer?_, Jereé Longman described the fans of the [700\nLevel](/wiki/700_Level \"700 Level\") of Veterans Stadium as having a reputation\nfor \"[hostile taunting](/wiki/Crowd_abuse \"Crowd abuse\"), fighting, public\nurination and general strangeness.\"[57] So many incidents occurred at a 1997\ngame against the 49ers that at the following home game, Judge [Seamus\nMcCaffery](/wiki/Seamus_McCaffery \"Seamus McCaffery\") began presiding over a\ntemporary courtroom at the stadium; 20 suspects came before him that day.[56]\nFan behavior improved after the team's move to Lincoln Financial Field, and\n\"Eagles Court\" ended in December 2003.[58]\n\n## Eagles

rock-formatted\nWYSP and sports-talk [Sports Radio 610 WIP](/wiki/WTEL_\\(AM\\) \"WTEL \\(AM\\)\"),\nas both stations are owned and operated by [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") Radio. In\n2011, CBS dropped the music on WYSP, renaming it [WIP-FM](/wiki/WIP-FM \"WIP-\nFM\") and making it a full simulcast of WIP. Later, 610 AM became a CBS Sports\nRadio national broadcast, and 94 WIP was broadcast on WIP FM. The Eagles\nextended their broadcasting contract with WIP-FM through 2024.[66]\n\n[Merrill Reese](/wiki/Merrill_Reese \"Merrill Reese\"), who joined the Eagles in\n1976, is the play-by-play announcer, and former Eagles wide receiver [Mike\nQuick](/wiki/Mike_Quick \"Mike Quick\"), who replaced the offense lineman Stan\nWalters beginning in 1998, is the color analyst. The post game show, which has\nconsisted of many Philadelphia sports personalities, as of the 2014 season is\nhosted by Kevin Riley, a former Eagles linebacker and special-teamer, and Rob\nEllis. Riley was the former post-game host for the show on 94 WYSP before the\nWIP change over; Rob Ellis hosts a weekly show nightly from 6–10 on 94.1 WIP-\nFM. No announcement was made prior to the start of preseason regarding who\nwould be the host(s) for 2015.\n\nIn 2015, the preseason games are being televised on [WCAU](/wiki/WCAU \"WCAU\"),\nthe local [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\") [owned and operated\nstation](/wiki/Owned_and_operated_station \"Owned and operated station\").\nTelevision announcers for these preseason games were not announced prior to\nthe start of preseason. During the regular season, games are governed by the\n[NFL's master broadcasting\ncontract](/wiki/National_Football_League_on_television \"National Football\nLeague on television\") with [FOX](/wiki/FOX \"FOX\"), [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\"),\n[NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\"), and [ESPN](/wiki/ESPN \"ESPN\"). Most games can be seen\non FOX-owned [WTXF-TV](/wiki/WTXF-TV \"WTXF-TV\"). When hosting an AFC team,\nthose games can be seen on CBS-owned [KYW-TV](/wiki/KYW-TV \"KYW-TV\").\n\n## Media and cultural reference\n\nIn the book _[MASH: A Novel About Three Army\nDoctors](/wiki/MASH:_A_Novel_About_Three_Army_Doctors \"MASH: A Novel About\nThree Army Doctors\")_ , the character [Captain Oliver Wendell \"Spearchucker\"\nJones](/wiki/Spearchucker_Jones \"Spearchucker Jones\") fictionally played for\nthe Philadelphia Eagles, though in the movie this was changed to San\nFrancisco.\n\nThe [1976](/wiki/1976_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"1976 Philadelphia Eagles\nseason\") draw was the subject of the movie\n_[Invincible](/wiki/Invincible_\\(2006_film\\) \"Invincible \\(2006 film\\)\")_. The\nmovie stars [Mark Wahlberg](/wiki/Mark_Wahlberg \"Mark Wahlberg\") as [Vince\nPapale](/wiki/Vince_Papale \"Vince Papale\"), a 30-year-old bartender and part-\ntime school teacher, and also a diehard Eagles fan who became an Eagles\nplayer. The film differs slightly from true events as the selection process\nwas invitation only, and Papale had at least some previous playing\nexperience.[67] The film _[Silver Linings\nPlaybook](/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook \"Silver Linings Playbook\")_ highlights\nthe [2008 Philadelphia Eagles season](/wiki/2008_Philadelphia_Eagles_season\n\"2008 Philadelphia Eagles season\"). The film was critically acclaimed and\nnominated for several awards including 8 [Academy Awards](/wiki/Academy_Awards\n\"Academy Awards\").\n\nIn the 1978 Academy Award-winning movie _[The Deer\nHunter](/wiki/The_Deer_Hunter \"The Deer Hunter\")_ , the Eagles are referenced\nwhen Nick talks to Stan in the bar, saying: \"Hey, I got a hundred bucks says\nthe Eagles never cross the fifty in the next half and Oakland wins by 20!\"\nStan responds; \"And I got an extra twenty says the Eagles' quarterback wears a\ndress!\"[68]\n\nThe award-winning comedy series _[It's Always Sunny in\nPhiladelphia](/wiki/It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia \"It's Always Sunny in\nPhiladelphia\")_ starring [Danny DeVito](/wiki/Danny_DeVito \"Danny DeVito\")\nmakes several references to the Philadelphia Eagles, most notably Season 3,\nEpisode 2 – \"The Gang Gets Invincible,\" the title being a reference to the\nWahlberg film.[69]\n\n## See also\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Libertybell_alone_small.jpg/22px-Libertybell_alone_small.jpg)[Philadelphia portal](/wiki/Portal:Philadelphia \"Portal:Philadelphia\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Sports_icon.png/31px-Sports_icon.png)[Sports portal](/wiki/Portal:Sports \"Portal:Sports\")\n\n  * [South Philadelphia Sports Complex](/wiki/South_Philadelphia_Sports_Complex \"South Philadelphia Sports Complex\")\n  * [Sports in Philadelphia](/wiki/Sports_in_Philadelphia \"Sports in Philadelphia\")\n  * [The Michael Vick Project](/wiki/The_Michael_Vick_Project \"The Michael Vick Project\")\n  * [Forbes' list of the most valuable sports teams](/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_most_valuable_sports_teams \"Forbes' list of the most valuable sports teams\")\n\n## Notes and references\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Philadelphia Eagles Team Facts\"](http://www.profootballhof.com/teams/philadelphia-eagles/team-facts/).
