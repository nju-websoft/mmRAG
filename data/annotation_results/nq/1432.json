Adel al-Jubeir told reporters the kingdom has been\nreassured by Washington while consultations continue about the deal, which he\nsaid stipulates effective inspections, and the possibility of snap-back\nsanctions if Iran violates the agreement. \"We are currently in talks with the\nAmerican government regarding these details, but it (the deal) generally seems\nto have achieved these objectives,\" said al-Jubeir, in\n[Washington](/wiki/Washington_D.C. \"Washington D.C.\") in July 2015.[36]\n\n### Russian involvement in Syria[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Adel_al-\nJubeir&action=edit&section=9&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro \"Edit section:\nRussian involvement in Syria\")]\n\nFollowing the [Russian intervention in\nSyria](/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War \"Russian\nmilitary intervention in the Syrian Civil War\") in support of\n[Syrian](/wiki/Syria \"Syria\") president in 2015, [Bashar al-\nAssad](/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad \"Bashar al-Assad\") al-Jubeir declared: “There is\nno future for Assad in Syria”. He spelled out that if the president did not\nstep down as part of a political transition, his country would embrace a\nmilitary option, “which also would end with the removal of Bashar al-Assad\nfrom power”.[37]\n\n### Removal of Assad[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Adel_al-\nJubeir&action=edit&section=10&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro \"Edit section:\nRemoval of Assad\")]\n\n\"Bashar al-Assad will leave - have no doubt about it,\" Saudi Arabia's Foreign\nMinister Adel al-Jubeir told CNN. \"He will either leave by a political process\nor he will be removed by force.\" Saudi Arabia has sent troops and fighter jets\nto a Turkish military base ahead of a possible ground invasion of Syria.\nJubeir said Saudi Arabia is prepared to contribute ground troops to the fight\nin Syria, but only as part of a US-led coalition. He added: \"We will push as\nmuch as we can to ensure that the political process works. But if that doesn't\nwork, it will be because of the obstinance of the Syrian regime and that of\nits allies. \"And should that prove to be the case, then it becomes clear that\nthere is no option to remove Bashar al-Assad except by force.\"[38]\n\n### Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Adel_al-\nJubeir&action=edit&section=11&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro \"Edit section:\nSaudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen\")]\n\nIn September 2016, al-Jubeir said that the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"), Saudi Arabia’s [close\nally](/wiki/Saudi_Arabia%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations \"Saudi Arabia–United\nKingdom relations\"), must continue to support Saudi Arabia’s [military\nintervention in Yemen](/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen \"Saudi\nArabian-led intervention in Yemen\"), saying: “Saudi Arabia is fighting a\nlegitimate war. We did not start this: the Iranian-backed Houthis started\nthis.
