The entrants are determined by the victors of the\n[Eastern](/wiki/Eastern_Conference_\\(NBA\\) \"Eastern Conference \\(NBA\\)\") and\n[Western](/wiki/Western_Conference_\\(NBA\\) \"Western Conference \\(NBA\\)\")\nconferences, who engage in a [best-of-seven](/wiki/Playoff_format#Best-of-\nseven_playoff \"Playoff format\") game series to determine the league champion.\nThe winners of the Finals are awarded the [Larry O'Brien Championship\nTrophy](/wiki/Larry_O%27Brien_Championship_Trophy \"Larry O'Brien Championship\nTrophy\"), which replaced the [Walter A. Brown\nTrophy](/wiki/Walter_A._Brown_Trophy \"Walter A. Brown Trophy\") in 1983.\n\nPrior to the 1949-50 season, the series was named the BAA Finals, before\nseeing alteration following the merger between the [Basketball Association of\nAmerica](/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America \"Basketball Association of\nAmerica\") (BAA) and the [National Basketball\nLeague](/wiki/National_Basketball_League_\\(United_States\\) \"National\nBasketball League \\(United States\\)\") (NBL) which created the modern NBA. The\ncompetition oversaw further name changes to NBA World Championship Series from\n1950 to 1982, as well as a brief stint as the Showdown, before settling on NBA\nFinals in 1986.[1]\n\nThe NBA Finals was initially structured to harbor a 2–3–2 format until 2013,\nwhere the first two and last two games of the series were played at the arena\nof the team who earned [home-court advantage](/wiki/Home_advantage \"Home\nadvantage\") by having the better record during the regular season. This was\nthen altered, because teams with the home-court advantage went 21–8 in all\nFinals appearances. The competition is currently structured under a 2–2–1–1–1\nformat, where the first two games are played at home for the higher-seeded\nteam, and the following two at the home of the lower-seeded team. The\nfollowing three are played at each team's home arena respectively.[2]\n\nA total of 19 franchises have won the NBA Finals. The [Boston\nCeltics](/wiki/Boston_Celtics \"Boston Celtics\") hold the record for the most\nvictories, having won the competition 17 times, as well as winning the\ncompetition the most times in a row, winning it eight times from 1959 to 1966.\nThe [Los Angeles Lakers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers \"Los Angeles Lakers\") have\nbeen runners-up the most times, winning 16 finals. The Eastern Conference has\nprovided the most champions, with 38 wins from ten franchises, while the\nWestern Conference have 32, from nine franchises.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 1947–56: Beginnings and Lakers dynasty\n    * 1.2 1957–69: Celtics dynasty\n    * 1.3 1970–79: Decade of parity\n    * 1.4 1980–90: Lakers–Celtics rivalry and the Bad Boys\n    * 1.5 1991–98: Bulls dynasty\n    * 1.6 1999–2010: Lakers' and Spurs' dominance\n    * 1.7 2011–14: Rise of the Heat\n    * 1.8 2015–present: Cavaliers–Warriors rivalry\n  * 2 Team records\n    * 2.1 Finals appearances\n    * 2.2 Active franchises with no Finals appearances\n    * 2.3 Most common matchups\n    * 2.4 Individual games records\n  * 3 Player records\n    * 3.1 Individual\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NBA_Finals&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nSee also: [List of NBA champions](/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions \"List of NBA\nchampions\")\n\n### 1947–56: Beginnings and Lakers\ndynasty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NBA_Finals&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: 1947–56: Beginnings and Lakers dynasty\")]\n\nDuring the first decade of the NBA, the [Minneapolis\nLakers](/wiki/Minneapolis_Lakers \"Minneapolis Lakers\") had the first NBA\ndynasty, winning five championships in six years under [Hall of\nFame](/wiki/Hall_of_Fame \"Hall of Fame\") head coach [John\nKundla](/wiki/John_Kundla \"John Kundla\").

They won eight straight NBA\nchampionships from 1959 through 1966.[3] This period marks the largest stretch\nof seasons that a single team made up over 65% of Finals appearances, and also\nincludes the [only ever time](/wiki/1957_NBA_Finals \"1957 NBA Finals\") the NBA\nFinals was decided in double overtime.\n\nWith the establishment of the Celtics dynasty in 1957 spearheaded by center\n[Bill Russell](/wiki/Bill_Russell \"Bill Russell\"), the team would see great\nsuccess, only ever encountering difficulty when up against teams led by [Wilt\nChamberlain](/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain \"Wilt Chamberlain\"). However, for most of\nthe late 1950s and 1960s, the Celtics and Russell managed to have an upper\nhand on teams led by Chamberlain.\n\nIn 1964, Chamberlain, who had moved to the state of California alongside [his\nteam](/wiki/Philadelphia_Warriors \"Philadelphia Warriors\"), led the [San\nFrancisco Warriors](/wiki/San_Francisco_Warriors \"San Francisco Warriors\") to\na Western Conference championship, but again failed to conquer the Celtics.\nThe following season, he returned to the [Eastern\nConference](/wiki/Eastern_Conference_\\(NBA\\) \"Eastern Conference \\(NBA\\)\") to\njoin the [Philadelphia 76ers](/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers \"Philadelphia 76ers\"),\nwho were the former Syracuse Nationals that had relocated to the city to cover\nthe vacancy created with the departure of the Warriors.\n\nThe first clash between the two stars in the playoffs was in 1966, with Boston\nwinning the series 4–1. In the following season, Philadelphia coach [Alex\nHannum](/wiki/Alex_Hannum \"Alex Hannum\") instructed Chamberlain to provide an\nincreased focus on playing a team game, to avoid drawing the double-teams that\ntroubled Chamberlain during the Finals. This tactical change brought the team\nto a new record of 68 wins the following season, as well as defeating the\nCeltics before winning the Finals. In 1968, Boston overcame a 3–1 deficit\nagainst Philadelphia to once again arrive in the Finals. They went on to\ndefeat the [Los Angeles Lakers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers \"Los Angeles Lakers\")\nin the Finals to again become NBA Champions.\n\nIn 1969, the Celtics faced great difficulty entering the postseason, as they\nhad an aging team and multiple injuries to a number of players. They qualified\nfor the playoffs as the fourth and final seed in the East, while the Lakers,\nwho in the added Chamberlain in the offseason to join stars [Jerry\nWest](/wiki/Jerry_West \"Jerry West\") and [Elgin Baylor](/wiki/Elgin_Baylor\n\"Elgin Baylor\"). The Lakers won the West and were prohibitive favorites to\nbecome Champions for the first time since relocating to Los Angeles. Despite\nholding a 2-1 advantage going into Game 4, the Lakers led 87–86 and had the\nball with 10 seconds to play. But after a turnover, [Sam\nJones](/wiki/Sam_Jones_\\(basketball\\) \"Sam Jones \\(basketball\\)\") scored to\ngive the Celtics a narrow 88–87 win and tying the series. The series was\neventually tied 3-3 going into Game 7 in Los Angeles, with Lakers owner [Jack\nCooke](/wiki/Jack_Kent_Cooke \"Jack Kent Cooke\") hanging balloons in the arena\nin anticipation of a Lakers victory. West also picked up injuries to his thigh\nand hamstring during the series, however, returned to play for the final game.\nRussell utilized this newly lacking mobility in West to organize fast breaks\nat every opportunity for the Celtics, which allowed them to gain an early\nlead. They held off a furious Lakers comeback to win 108–106 and win the\nseries, and win their eleventh championship in 13 years.\n\nAs many stars either declined or retired following this win, it is largely\nrecognized as the last NBA Finals conducted by the Celtics dynasty.\n\n### 1970–79: Decade of\nparity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NBA_Finals&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: 1970–79: Decade of parity\")]\n\nThe 1970s saw eight different teams win the title, with the Celtics and [New\nYork Knicks](/wiki/New_York_Knicks \"New York Knicks\") winning twice.\n\nIn [1970](/wiki/1970_NBA_Finals \"1970 NBA Finals\"), a classic final featured\nthe Knicks against the Lakers. In the waning moments of Game 3, with the\nseries tied, [Jerry West](/wiki/Jerry_West \"Jerry West\") hit a basket from 60\nfeet to tie the game, a shot which became one of the most famous ever.\nHowever, the Knicks won in [overtime](/wiki/Overtime_\\(sports\\) \"Overtime\n\\(sports\\)\") and continued their momentum for a 4–3 win, becoming the first\nteam after the Celtics dynasty to win an NBA championship. The [Milwaukee\nBucks](/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks \"Milwaukee Bucks\") also won their first franchise\ntitle, defeating the [Baltimore\nBullets](/wiki/Baltimore_Bullets_\\(1963%E2%80%9373\\) \"Baltimore Bullets\n\\(1963–73\\)\") in 1971.\n\nTwo seasons after losing in the Finals, the Lakers got a measure of revenge by\nwinning 33 straight games, the longest such streak in NBA history. By season's\nend, they broke the record for most wins in a season with 69, one more than\nthe [1966–67 Philadelphia 76ers](/wiki/1966-67_Philadelphia_76ers_season\n\"1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers season\"), before taking home the\n[championship](/wiki/1972_NBA_Finals \"1972 NBA Finals\") for the first time\nsince relocating to [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\"). The Knicks\nreturned to win the championship again a season later to record their second\never victorious season.\n\nDespite the rise of the Knicks, the [1974 championship](/wiki/1974_NBA_Finals\n\"1974 NBA Finals\") returned to the Celtics, as a newly formed cohort of\nplayers led by [Dave Cowens](/wiki/Dave_Cowens \"Dave Cowens\") demonstrated\nexcellent teamwork and resilience to win in seven games to secure another\ntitle.\n\nFollowing the success of the Lakers, the 1970s were characterized by a major\nbreakthrough of the league's western franchises. In 1975, after compiling a\n48–34 regular-season record, the [Golden State\nWarriors](/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors \"Golden State Warriors\") swept the\nheavily favored [Washington Bullets](/wiki/Washington_Bullets \"Washington\nBullets\") 4–0 in the [1975 NBA Finals](/wiki/1975_NBA_Finals \"1975 NBA\nFinals\"). In 1976, the [Phoenix Suns](/wiki/Phoenix_Suns \"Phoenix Suns\"), who\nonly enjoyed eight years of existence as a franchise, overcame a losing record\nearly in the season to build a remarkable win streak to finish 42–40. The\nevents culminated in upset victories over the [Seattle\nSuperSonics](/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics \"Seattle SuperSonics\") and the\nWarriors, before facing Boston in the Finals. The teams split the first four\ngames, before Game 5 went into three overtimes before Boston won 128–126. The\nCeltics managed to secure their 13th championship quickly after, defeating the\nSuns 87–80 in Game 6.\n\nOther western franchises that secured their first titles in the 1970s included\nthe [Portland Trail Blazers](/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers \"Portland Trail\nBlazers\") in 1977, and the Washington Bullets defeating the SuperSonics in\n1978. The SuperSonics managed to exact revenge in the following season,\nhowever, as they secured their first franchise title in 1979.\n\n### 1980–90: Lakers–Celtics rivalry and the Bad\nBoys[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NBA_Finals&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section:\n1980–90: Lakers–Celtics rivalry and the Bad Boys\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/1985_Finals_Lipofsky.jpg)](/wiki/File:1985_Finals_Lipofsky.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1985_Finals_Lipofsky.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe 1980s saw a renewal in the rivalry between the [Boston\nCeltics](/wiki/Boston_Celtics \"Boston Celtics\") (green) and the [Los Angeles\nLakers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers \"Los Angeles Lakers\") (gold), combining to\nwin eight titles.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1990, the Celtics, 76ers, Lakers, or the [Detroit\nPistons](/wiki/Detroit_Pistons \"Detroit Pistons\") won every NBA\nFinals.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] The Lakers won five titles from 1980 to 1990 (1980, 1982, 1985,\n1987, and 1988); the Celtics won three (1981, 1984, and 1986); the Pistons won\ntwice (1989 and 1990); and the 76ers won once (1983).\n\nThe [1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship\nGame](/wiki/1979_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship_Game \"1979\nNCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game\") featured [Magic\nJohnson](/wiki/Magic_Johnson \"Magic Johnson\")'s [Michigan State\nUniversity](/wiki/Michigan_State_University \"Michigan State University\") team\nfacing off against [Larry Bird](/wiki/Larry_Bird \"Larry Bird\")'s [Indiana\nState University](/wiki/Indiana_State_University \"Indiana State University\")\nteam. This meeting has been immortalized as the beginning of the Lakers and\nCeltics rivalry of the 1980s, which saw each team being represented by either\nplayer respectively. The game also attracted the largest ever TV rating for an\nNCAA Championship game, with 38 percent of all television viewers that night\ntuned to the game.\n\nBird had actually been drafted the year before, but later decided to stay an\nadditional year, and the two superstars both entered the league in 1979,\nleading their respective teams to dazzling heights. Johnson and the [Showtime\nLakers](/wiki/Showtime_Lakers \"Showtime Lakers\") reached the [1980 NBA\nFinals](/wiki/1980_NBA_Finals \"1980 NBA Finals\") against the 76ers, which was\nalso led by NBA superstar [Julius Erving](/wiki/Julius_Erving \"Julius\nErving\"). The Lakers took a 3–2 lead, but [Kareem Abdul-\nJabbar](/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar \"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\") could not play in\nGame 6 due to injury. Johnson, a natural point guard, was shifted to center,\nand ended up playing every position on the court during the game, scoring 42\npoints, while also attaining 15 rebounds and 7 assists[4] to win his first\nchampionship while being awarded his first NBA Finals MVP; a remarkable\nperformance in the annals of the sport.\n\nBoston reached the [1981 NBA Finals](/wiki/1981_NBA_Finals \"1981 NBA Finals\")\nled by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, [Kevin\nMcHale](/wiki/Kevin_McHale_\\(basketball\\) \"Kevin McHale \\(basketball\\)\"), and\n[Robert Parish](/wiki/Robert_Parish \"Robert Parish\"). During the [1980 NBA\ndraft](/wiki/1980_NBA_draft \"1980 NBA draft\"), the Celtics traded two first\nround picks to the Warriors for Parish and a first round pick later spent on\nMcHale. Considered to be one of the best front courts of all time, all three\nplayers would later make the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[5]\nThey met the [Houston Rockets](/wiki/Houston_Rockets \"Houston Rockets\") in the\n1981 Finals, practically single-handedly carried by [Moses\nMalone](/wiki/Moses_Malone \"Moses Malone\"), who upset the Lakers and Johnson\nin the first round. The Rockets were only the second team in NBA history to\nmake the Finals after posting a losing record in the regular season, and the\nCeltics had an NBA best record of 62–20. The Celtics would later win the\nFinals in 6 games.\n\nThe Lakers returned to the NBA Finals in [1982](/wiki/1982_NBA_Finals \"1982\nNBA Finals\"), time time led by new coach [Pat Riley](/wiki/Pat_Riley \"Pat\nRiley\"), in a rematch against the 76ers. The 76ers defeated the Celtics in the\nEastern Conference finals in a 7-game series, but were defeated by Lakers in 6\ngames, with Johnson being named Finals MVP. Upon losing their past three NBA\nFinals appearances, the 76ers decided that they needed one more piece to\nbecome champions, and enlisted Malone as their premier target. On September\n15, 1982, they traded for Malone, who was also the league's reigning MVP.\n\nWith the new duo of Malone and Erving, the 76ers won the [1983 NBA\nFinals](/wiki/1983_NBA_Finals \"1983 NBA Finals\"), losing only once in the\nentire playoffs, as well as sweeping the Lakers. However, the [1984 NBA\nFinals](/wiki/1984_NBA_Finals \"1984 NBA Finals\") was conducted by the Celtics\nand Lakers, who faced each other for the first time since 1969. After an\ninspired performance from Bird, the Celtics toppled the Lakers 4–3. The final\ngame of this series attracted the largest ever TV audience for an NBA game,\nand the second-largest ever for a basketball game, with only the game between\nthe two stars played five years earlier having a larger audience. It was the\nlast NBA Finals played in the 2–2–1–1–1 format, until 2014.\n\nIn the [1985 NBA Finals](/wiki/1985_NBA_Finals \"1985 NBA Finals\"), the Lakers\nmade amends for their previous eight losses to the Celtics by defeating them\nin six games. Even though the Lakers lost the first game by 34 points in the\n[Memorial Day Massacre](/wiki/Memorial_Day_Massacre \"Memorial Day Massacre\"),\nthey won 4 of the next 5 games, including Game 6 at the [Boston\nGarden](/wiki/Boston_Garden \"Boston Garden\"), to finally end the long years of\nfrustration of failing to defeat the Celtics. These finals were the first to\nbe played in the 2–3–2 format, which was suggested by Boston coach [Red\nAuerbach](/wiki/Red_Auerbach \"Red Auerbach\") to NBA commissioner [David\nStern](/wiki/David_Stern \"David Stern\"), as he hoped to cut back on the\nfrequent traveling from [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\") to Los Angeles.\n\nThe [1986 NBA Finals](/wiki/1986_NBA_Finals \"1986 NBA Finals\") saw the Celtics\nface off against the Rockets, with Boston winning in six games, as well as\nsecuring their 16th title. Bird was also named Finals MVP for the second time.\nIn [1987](/wiki/1987_NBA_Finals \"1987 NBA Finals\"), the Lakers and Celtics met\nagain, with both sides holding a win in the Finals apiece. With the third\nbeing contested, it is regarded as a rubber match between the two dynasties.\nThe Lakers won the first two games, but Boston won Game 3. In Game 4, Johnson\nhit an sky-hook with two seconds left to give the Lakers a 107–106 win and a\n3–1 series lead. The Lakers would lose Game 5, but would eventually win Game 6\nto clinch the series, and a 2-1 all time win against the Celtics. Johnson was\nalso named Finals MVP for the third time.\n\nIn the following two seasons, the aging Celtics failed to reach the Finals,\nbecoming overshadowed by the rise of the [Detroit\nPistons](/wiki/Detroit_Pistons \"Detroit Pistons\"). The Lakers would manage to\ndefend their title in the [1988 Finals](/wiki/1988_NBA_Finals \"1988 NBA\nFinals\"), winning the series in 7 games against the Pistons. They then became\nthe first team to win back-to-back NBA titles since 1969.[6] Seeking a three-\npeat in [1989](/wiki/1989_NBA_Finals \"1989 NBA Finals\"), the Lakers were swept\nby the Pistons in a rematch of the previous year's Finals. In\n[1990](/wiki/1990_NBA_Finals \"1990 NBA Finals\"), the Pistons then went back-\nto-back after defeating the Blazers in five games, attaining the nickname \"Bad\nBoys\" due to its rough, physical play. Led by a Hall of Fame back court in\n[Joe Dumars](/wiki/Joe_Dumars \"Joe Dumars\") and [Isiah\nThomas](/wiki/Isiah_Thomas \"Isiah Thomas\") and a rugged front court in [Dennis\nRodman](/wiki/Dennis_Rodman \"Dennis Rodman\") and [Bill\nLaimbeer](/wiki/Bill_Laimbeer \"Bill Laimbeer\"), the Pistons were attained\ngreat success.\n\n### 1991–98: Bulls\ndynasty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NBA_Finals&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: 1991–98: Bulls dynasty\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Phil_Jackson_Lipofsky.JPG/170px-\nPhil_Jackson_Lipofsky.JPG)](/wiki/File:Phil_Jackson_Lipofsky.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Phil_Jackson_Lipofsky.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Michael Jordan](/wiki/Michael_Jordan \"Michael Jordan\") combined with coach\n[Phil Jackson](/wiki/Phil_Jackson \"Phil Jackson\") to win six NBA\nchampionships.\n\nThe majority of the 1990s was marked by the supremacy of the [Chicago\nBulls](/wiki/Chicago_Bulls \"Chicago Bulls\"), which saw them appear in six\nFinals. Coached by [Phil Jackson](/wiki/Phil_Jackson \"Phil Jackson\") and led\nby NBA superstar [Michael Jordan](/wiki/Michael_Jordan \"Michael Jordan\"), the\nBulls won a title in every single appearance to the Finals from 1991 to 1998.\nJordan was also the Finals MVP every time. The only other team to win\nchampionships during this period was the [Houston\nRockets](/wiki/Houston_Rockets \"Houston Rockets\"), who went back-to-back in\n1994 and 1995 during Jordan's initial retirement from professional basketball.\n\nThe first championship came at the expense of the [Los Angeles\nLakers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers \"Los Angeles Lakers\"), which also saw the\nlast appearance in the Finals for [Magic Johnson](/wiki/Magic_Johnson \"Magic\nJohnson\"). Billed[_[by\nwhom?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] as a showdown between the aging\nJohnson and the upstart Jordan, the Lakers won the first game, 93–91. For the\nrest of the series, Pippen guarded Johnson, allowing Jordan to attain a free\nscoring role to lead Chicago to ultimately taking the next four games. The\nBulls returned to the Finals in the next year, pitted against [Clyde\nDrexler](/wiki/Clyde_Drexler \"Clyde Drexler\") and the [Portland Trail\nBlazers](/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers \"Portland Trail Blazers\"). Throughout\nthe 1991–1992 season, Jordan and Drexler led their teams to the best records\nin their respective conferences, leading to several comparisons between the\ntwo players in anticipation of a postseason match-up. Chicago defeated the\nTrail Blazers in Game 1 by 33 points, a game notable for Jordan breaking the\nrecord for the most three-pointer in a first half, with six. Game 2 went into\novertime, with the Trail Blazers outscoring the Bulls 18–7 in the final period\nto run away with the win. Game 3 and 4 were split between Chicago and\nPortland, respectively, but the Bulls took the final two games, clinching\ntheir second championship.\n\nIn 1993, Jordan was matched against close friend [Charles\nBarkley](/wiki/Charles_Barkley \"Charles Barkley\"), who was the league's\nreigning MVP at the [Phoenix Suns](/wiki/Phoenix_Suns \"Phoenix Suns\"). The\nBulls won the first two games in Phoenix, with 100–92 and 111–108 as the final\nscores, respectively. The Suns, rallying behind Barkley, won Game 3, 129–121,\nin Chicago in triple overtime. The Bulls took Game 4, 111–105, with Jordan\nscoring 55 points and tying [Rick Barry](/wiki/Rick_Barry \"Rick Barry\") for\nthe second-most points in an NBA Finals game. The Suns won Game 5, 108–98,\nsending the series back to Phoenix. Chicago won the series clincher in Game 6,\n99–98,on [John Paxson](/wiki/John_Paxson \"John Paxson\")'s three-pointer, as\nthe Bulls became the third team in history to [three-peat](/wiki/Three-peat\n\"Three-peat\"). After this win, Jordan would retire from basketball to pursue a\ncareer in baseball.\n\nFollowing Jordan's departure, the [Houston Rockets](/wiki/Houston_Rockets\n\"Houston Rockets\"), led by [Hakeem Olajuwon](/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon \"Hakeem\nOlajuwon\"), won the 1994 and 1995 NBA titles. During this period, Olajuwon\nbecame the only player in history to win the [NBA\nMVP](/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Most_Valuable_Player_Award\n\"National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award\"), [NBA Defensive\nPlayer of the Year](/wiki/NBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award \"NBA\nDefensive Player of the Year Award\") and Finals MVP awards in the same season.\nThat was the only year that both the NBA and [NHL\nfinals](/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals \"Stanley Cup Finals\") went to seven games\nwhile involving teams from the same city, with the Rockets facing the [New\nYork Knicks](/wiki/New_York_Knicks \"New York Knicks\") in 1994.
