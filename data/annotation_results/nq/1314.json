A lens with a larger\nmaximum aperture (that is, a smaller minimum f-number) is called a \"fast lens\"\nbecause it can achieve the same exposure with a faster [shutter\nspeed](/wiki/Shutter_speed \"Shutter speed\"). Conversely, a smaller maximum\naperture (larger minimum f-number) is \"slow\" because it delivers less light\nintensity and requires a slower (longer) shutter speed.\n\nA fast lens speed is desirable in taking pictures in dim light, or with long\n[telephoto](/wiki/Telephoto \"Telephoto\") lenses and for controlling [depth of\nfield](/wiki/Depth_of_field \"Depth of field\") and [bokeh](/wiki/Bokeh\n\"Bokeh\"), especially in portrait photography,[1] and for [sports\nphotography](/wiki/Sports_photography \"Sports photography\") and\n[photojournalism](/wiki/Photojournalism \"Photojournalism\").\n\nLenses may also be referred to as being \"faster\" or \"slower\" than one another;\nso an [f/3.5](/wiki/F-number \"F-number\") lens can be described as faster than\nan f/5.6.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Tradeoffs\n  * 2 Fast lenses\n    * 2.1 Maximum possible speed\n    * 2.2 List of ultrafast lenses\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n## Tradeoffs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lens_speed&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Tradeoffs\")]\n\nAttaining maximum lens speed requires engineering tradeoffs, and as such,\n\"[prime](/wiki/Prime_lens \"Prime lens\")\" (fixed focal length) lenses are\ngenerally faster than [zoom lenses](/wiki/Zoom_lens \"Zoom lens\"), and modern\nmanual-focus lenses are generally faster than their autofocus counterparts.[2]\n\nWith 35mm cameras, the fastest lenses are typically in the \"[normal\nlens](/wiki/Normal_lens \"Normal lens\")\" range near 50mm and there are several\nhigh-quality fast lenses available that are relatively inexpensive. For\nexample, the [Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II](/wiki/Canon_EF_50mm_f/1.8_II \"Canon EF\n50mm f/1.8 II\") or [Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm\nf/1.8D](/wiki/Nikon_AF_Nikkor_50_mm_f/1.8D \"Nikon AF Nikkor 50 mm f/1.8D\") are\nvery inexpensive, but quite fast and optically well-regarded. Old fast manual\nfocus lenses, just as the Nikkor-S(C) or Nikkor AI-S 50mm f/1.4, were\nhistorically produced abundantly, and are thus sold relatively inexpensively\non the used lens market.\n\nEspecially outside of the \"normal lenses\", lens speed also tends to correlate\nwith the price and/or quality of the lens. This is because lenses with larger\nmaximum apertures require greater care with regard to design, precision of\nmanufacture, special coatings and quality of glass. At wide apertures,\n[spherical aberration](/wiki/Spherical_aberration \"Spherical aberration\")\nbecomes more significant and must be corrected. Faster\n[telephoto](/wiki/Telephoto \"Telephoto\") and wide-angle\n[retrofocus](/wiki/Retrofocus \"Retrofocus\") designs tend to be much more\nexpensive.\n\n## Fast lenses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lens_speed&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Fast lenses\")]\n\nThe fastest lenses in general production now are f/1.2 or f/1.4, with more at\nf/1.8 and f/2.0, and many at f/2.8 or slower. What is considered \"fast\" has\nevolved to lower f-numbers over the years, due to advances in [lens\ndesign](/wiki/Lens_design \"Lens design\"), [optical\nmanufacturing](/wiki/Optical_manufacturing \"Optical manufacturing\"), quality\nof glass, [optical coatings](/wiki/Optical_coating \"Optical coating\"), and the\nmove toward smaller imaging formats. For example, the [1911 Encyclopædia\nBritannica](/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica \"1911 Encyclopædia\nBritannica\") states that \"...[Lenses] are also sometimes classified according\nto their rapidity, as expressed by their effective apertures, into extra\nrapid, with apertures larger than f/6; rapid, with apertures from f/6 to f/8;\nslow, with apertures less than f/11.\"\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Canon_85mm_comparison_%28front%29.jpg/250px-\nCanon_85mm_comparison_%28front%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Canon_85mm_comparison_\\(front\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Canon_85mm_comparison_\\(front\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Canon 85mm f/1.8 and f/1.2](/wiki/Canon_EF_85mm_lens \"Canon EF 85mm lens\")\nshowing their large [entrance pupils](/wiki/Entrance_pupil \"Entrance pupil\")\n\nFor scale, note that f/0.5, f/0.7, f/1.0, f/1.4, and f/2.0 are each 1 f-stop\napart (2× as fast), as an f-stop corresponds to a factor of [square root of\n2](/wiki/Square_root_of_2 \"Square root of 2\"), about 1.4. Thus around f/1.0, a\nchange of 0.1 corresponds to about 1/4 of an f-stop (by [linear\napproximation](/wiki/Linear_approximation \"Linear approximation\")): f/1.0 is\nabout 50% faster than f/1.2, which is about 50% faster than f/1.4.\n\nAs of\n2017[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lens_speed&action=edit),\nCanon, Nikon, Pentax and Sony all make an autofocus 50mm f/1.4 lens. These are\nnot unusual lenses and are relatively inexpensive. Canon also makes autofocus\n50mm and 85mm f/1.2 lenses, while Nikon makes a manual focus 50mm f/1.2 lens\nand an autofocus 85mm f/1.4; see [Canon EF 50mm\nlenses](/wiki/Canon_EF_50mm_lens \"Canon EF 50mm lens\") and [Canon EF 85mm\nlenses](/wiki/Canon_EF_85mm_lens \"Canon EF 85mm lens\") for details. Pentax\nmakes a 50mm f/1.4 lens and 55mm f/1.4 lens for [APS-C](/wiki/APS-C \"APS-C\")\ncameras; see [Pentax lenses](/wiki/Pentax_lenses \"Pentax lenses\"). Sony makes\na 50mm f/1.4 lens which is a continuation of the [Minolta AF 50mm f/1.4\nlens](/wiki/Minolta_AF_50mm_f/1.4_lens \"Minolta AF 50mm f/1.4 lens\"), and two\nlenses with Carl Zeiss: a 50mm f/1.4 and 85mm f/1.4.\n\nThe maximum [exposure time](/wiki/Exposure_time \"Exposure time\") in free-hand\nphotography can be enhanced even more also for fast lenses, if the camera is\nequipped with an [image stabilisation](/wiki/Image_stabilisation \"Image\nstabilisation\") system. In 2014 [Panasonic](/wiki/Panasonic \"Panasonic\")\nintroduced the fastest lens with in-built stabilisation, the\n[Leica](/wiki/Leica_Camera \"Leica Camera\") [Nocticron](/wiki/Nocticron\n\"Nocticron\") 42.5 mm f/1.2, which in the meantime even can be operated with\ndual image stabilisation (Dual I.S.), provided that the camera body has an\nadditional [stabilising system at the image\nsensor](/wiki/Image_stabilization#Sensor-shift \"Image stabilization\"), too.\n\nIn the mid 60s there was something of a fad for fast lenses among the major\nmanufacturers.[3] In 1966 in response to the trend [Carl\nZeiss](/wiki/Carl_Zeiss \"Carl Zeiss\") displayed a prop lens christened the\nSuper-Q-Gigantar 40mm f/0.33 at [photokina](/wiki/Photokina_1966 \"Photokina\n1966\").[3] Made from various parts found around the factory (the lenses came\nfrom a [darkroom condenser enlarger](/wiki/Enlarger#Types_of_Enlarger\n\"Enlarger\")), the claimed speed and focal lengths were purely nominal and it\nwasn't usable for photography.[3][4]\n\n### Maximum possible\nspeed[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lens_speed&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Maximum possible speed\")]\n\nUltimately, the speed of a lens is limited by mechanical constraints of the\ncamera system (shutter or mirror clearance, [mount](/wiki/Lens_mount \"Lens\nmount\") diameter). The smallest possible [working f-number](/wiki/Working_f-\nnumber \"Working f-number\") is\n\n     N min = 1 2 N A max = 1 2 n sin ⁡ θ {\\displaystyle N_{\\text{min}}={\\frac {1}{2\\;\\mathrm {NA} _{\\text{max}}}}={\\frac {1}{2\\,n\\sin \\theta }}} ![N_{\\\\text{min}}={\\\\frac {1}{2\\\\;\\\\mathrm {NA} _{\\\\text{max}}}}={\\\\frac {1}{2\\\\,n\\\\sin \\\\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e77288bc3a6fce874f67e9afda1ccb03be18d916)\n\nwhere\n\n  * NAmax is the largest possible [numerical aperture](/wiki/Numerical_aperture \"Numerical aperture\"),\n  * n is the [index of refraction](/wiki/Index_of_refraction \"Index of refraction\") of the medium behind the lens, most often air where n = 1,\n  * θ is the half-angle of the maximum cone of light that can reach the film or sensor.\n\nThis sets a limit close to f/1.0 to f/1.2 for most [SLR](/wiki/Single-\nlens_reflex_camera \"Single-lens reflex camera\") mounts, whereas lenses for\n[rangefinder](/wiki/Rangefinder_camera \"Rangefinder camera\") and\n[mirrorless](/wiki/Mirrorless_camera \"Mirrorless camera\") cameras can be\nfaster, as they can be brought closer to the image plane. Reproduction lenses\nincapable of infinity focus can have nominal f-numbers smaller than this\nlimit, as the limit applies to the _working_ f-number (the f-number corrected\nby the [bellows factor](/wiki/Bellows_\\(photography\\) \"Bellows\n\\(photography\\)\")), not to the nominal f-number. It should be noted that only\nthe working f-number correctly assesses the light gathering power of the lens.\n\nSince sin θ < 1, it follows that no lens can be faster than f/0.5 if it\noperates in air. Lenses can be made faster than this by requiring the film\nemulsion to be in physical contact with the rear element, thus eliminating the\nair gap between the lens and the emulsion. Another option is to use [oil\nimmersion](/wiki/Oil_immersion \"Oil immersion\") techniques.\n\n### List of ultrafast\nlenses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lens_speed&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: List of ultrafast lenses\")]\n\nSome of the fastest camera lenses in production as of\n2017[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lens_speed&action=edit)\nwere as follows:\n\n  * Handevision Ibelux 40mm f/0.85, Made for multiple camera mounts including Micro 4/3, Sony E-Mount and Fujifilm X-Mount\n  * [Fujinon](/wiki/Fujinon \"Fujinon\") 43mm f/0.85\n  * [Cosina Voigtländer](/wiki/Cosina_Voigtl%C3%A4nder \"Cosina Voigtländer\") Nokton 17.5mm f/0.95 Aspherical [Micro Four Thirds](/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system \"Micro Four Thirds system\") mount[5][6][7]\n  * [Cosina Voigtländer](/wiki/Cosina_Voigtl%C3%A4nder \"Cosina Voigtländer\") Nokton 25mm f/0.95 [Micro Four Thirds](/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system \"Micro Four Thirds system\") mount[6][8]\n  * [Cosina Voigtländer](/wiki/Cosina_Voigtl%C3%A4nder \"Cosina Voigtländer\") Nokton 42.5mm f/0.95 [Micro Four Thirds](/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system \"Micro Four Thirds system\") mount[6][9]\n  * [Leica](/wiki/Leica_Camera \"Leica Camera\") Noctilux-M 50mm f/0.95 ASPH announced on September 15, 2008, it is one of the fastest [aspherical lens](/wiki/Aspherical_lens \"Aspherical lens\") to have ever reached mass production, with a MSRP of £6290 (approximately US$10,000).[10]\n  * SLR Magic HyperPrime LM 50mm T0.95 (f/0.92)\n  * [Noktor](/wiki/Noktor \"Noktor\") 50mm f/0.95 'HyperPrime'[11] a fast CCTV lens design adapted for the [Micro Four Thirds system](/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system \"Micro Four Thirds system\")[12]\n  * SLR Magic 25mm T/0.95\n  * SLR Magic 35mm T/0.95\n  * [Mitakon 50mm](/wiki/Shenyang_Zhongyi_Mitakon_Speedmaster_50_mm_f/0.95 \"Shenyang Zhongyi Mitakon Speedmaster 50 mm f/0.95\") and 35mm f/0.95\n  * Vantage One T/1.0 Cine lenses - 17.5mm to 120mm Super35mm Spherical Primes.\n  * Metabones 0.58x BMPCC Speed Booster (for Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera) combined with an f/1.2 SLR lens to yield f/0.74 or combined with an f/1.4 SLR lens to yield f/0.80 [13]\n  * Metabones 0.64x Speed Booster XL (for Micro Four Thirds format) combined with an f/1.2 SLR lens to yield f/0.80 or combined with an f/1.4 SLR lens to yield f/0.90[14]\n  * Metabones 0.71x Speed Booster ULTRA (for either Micro Four Thirds or APS-C formats) combined with an f/1.2 SLR lens to yield f/0.90 or combined with an f/1.4 SLR lens to yield f/1.0[15][16]\n\nThe following camera lenses are no longer in production as of\n2010[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lens_speed&action=edit):\n\n  * [American Optical](/w/index.php?title=American_Optical&action=edit&redlink=1 \"American Optical \\(page does not exist\\)\") 81mm f/0.38 Solid Schmidt Mirror lens.
