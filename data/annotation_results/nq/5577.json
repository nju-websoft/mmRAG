A replacement for the ineffective [League of\nNations](/wiki/League_of_Nations \"League of Nations\"), the organization was\nestablished on 24 October 1945 after [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World\nWar II\") with the aim of preventing another such conflict. At its founding,\nthe UN had 51 [member states](/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations\n\"Member states of the United Nations\"); there are now 193. The [headquarters\nof the UN](/wiki/Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations \"Headquarters of the\nUnited Nations\") is in [Manhattan](/wiki/Manhattan \"Manhattan\"), [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), and is subject to\n[extraterritoriality](/wiki/Extraterritoriality \"Extraterritoriality\").\nFurther main offices are situated in\n[Geneva](/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Geneva \"United Nations Office at\nGeneva\"), [Nairobi](/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Nairobi \"United Nations\nOffice at Nairobi\"), and [Vienna](/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Vienna\n\"United Nations Office at Vienna\"). The organization is financed by assessed\nand voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include\nmaintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights,\nfostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and\nproviding humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed\nconflict. The UN is the largest, most familiar, most internationally\nrepresented and most powerful [intergovernmental\norganization](/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization \"Intergovernmental\norganization\") in the world.[3]\n\nThe [UN Charter](/wiki/United_Nations_Charter \"United Nations Charter\") was\ndrafted at [a\nconference](/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_International_Organization\n\"United Nations Conference on International Organization\") between April–June\n1945 in [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\"), and was signed\non 26 June 1945 at the conclusion of the conference;[4][5] this charter took\neffect on 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to\npreserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the [Cold\nWar](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\") between the US and Soviet Union and their\nrespective allies. The organization participated in major actions in\n[Korea](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\") and [the\nCongo](/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_the_Congo \"United Nations Operation\nin the Congo\"), as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in\n1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread\n[decolonization](/wiki/Decolonization \"Decolonization\") in the 1960s, and by\nthe 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far\noutstripped its spending on [peacekeeping](/wiki/Peacekeeping \"Peacekeeping\").\nAfter the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping\nmissions across the world with varying degrees of success.\n\nThe UN has six principal organs: the [General\nAssembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly \"United Nations General\nAssembly\") (the main deliberative assembly); the [Security\nCouncil](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council \"United Nations Security\nCouncil\") (for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security); the\n[Economic and Social Council](/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council\n\"United Nations Economic and Social Council\") (ECOSOC; for promoting\ninternational economic and social co-operation and development); the\n[Secretariat](/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat \"United Nations Secretariat\")\n(for providing studies, information, and facilities needed by the UN); the\n[International Court of Justice](/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice\n\"International Court of Justice\") (the primary judicial organ); and the [UN\nTrusteeship Council](/wiki/United_Nations_Trusteeship_Council \"United Nations\nTrusteeship Council\") (inactive since 1994). [UN\nSystem](/wiki/United_Nations_System \"United Nations System\") agencies include\nthe [World Bank Group](/wiki/World_Bank_Group \"World Bank Group\"), the [World\nHealth Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization \"World Health\nOrganization\"), the [World Food Programme](/wiki/World_Food_Programme \"World\nFood Programme\"), [UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO \"UNESCO\"), and [UNICEF](/wiki/UNICEF\n\"UNICEF\"). The UN's most prominent officer is the [Secretary-\nGeneral](/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations \"Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations\"), an office held by Portuguese politician and diplomat\n[António Guterres](/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres \"António Guterres\") since 2017.\nNon-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC\nand other agencies to participate in the UN's work.\n\nThe organization won the [Nobel Peace Prize](/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize \"Nobel\nPeace Prize\") in 2001, and a number of its officers and agencies have also\nbeen awarded the prize. Other evaluations of the UN's effectiveness have been\nmixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for\npeace and human development, while others have called the organization\nineffective, corrupt, or biased.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Background\n    * 1.2 1942 \"Declaration of United Nations\" by the Allies of World War II\n    * 1.3 Founding\n    * 1.4 Cold War Era\n    * 1.5 Post-Cold War\n  * 2 Structure\n    * 2.1 General Assembly\n    * 2.2 Security Council\n    * 2.3 Secretariat\n    * 2.4 International Court of Justice\n    * 2.5 Economic and Social Council\n    * 2.6 Specialized agencies\n  * 3 Membership\n    * 3.1 Group of 77\n  * 4 Objectives\n    * 4.1 Peacekeeping and security\n    * 4.2 Human rights\n    * 4.3 Economic development and humanitarian assistance\n    * 4.4 Other\n  * 5 Funding\n  * 6 Evaluations, awards, and criticism\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 References\n    * 9.1 Citations\n    * 9.2 Bibliography\n  * 10 Further reading\n  * 11 External links\n\n## History\n\nMain article: [History of the United\nNations](/wiki/History_of_the_United_Nations \"History of the United Nations\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/United_Nations_organization_sketch_by_Franklin_Roosevelt_with_the_Four_Policemen_in_1943.jpg/220px-\nUnited_Nations_organization_sketch_by_Franklin_Roosevelt_with_the_Four_Policemen_in_1943.jpg)](/wiki/File:United_Nations_organization_sketch_by_Franklin_Roosevelt_with_the_Four_Policemen_in_1943.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:United_Nations_organization_sketch_by_Franklin_Roosevelt_with_the_Four_Policemen_in_1943.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n1943 sketch by Franklin Roosevelt of the UN original three branches: The [Four\nPolicemen](/wiki/Four_Policemen \"Four Policemen\"), an executive branch, and an\ninternational assembly of forty UN member states.\n\n### Background\n\nIn the century prior to the UN's creation, several international treaty\norganizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between\nnations, such as the [International Committee of the Red\nCross](/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross \"International Committee\nof the Red Cross\") and the [Hague Conventions of 1899 and\n1907](/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907 \"Hague Conventions of 1899 and\n1907\").[6] Following the catastrophic loss of life in the [First World\nWar](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\"), the [Paris Peace\nConference](/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919 \"Paris Peace Conference, 1919\")\nestablished the [League of Nations](/wiki/League_of_Nations \"League of\nNations\") to maintain harmony between countries.[7] This organization resolved\nsome territorial disputes and created international structures for areas such\nas postal mail, aviation, and opium control, some of which would later be\nabsorbed into the UN.[8] However, the League lacked representation for\ncolonial peoples (then half the world's population) and significant\nparticipation from several major powers, including the US, USSR, Germany, and\nJapan; it failed to act against the [Japanese invasion of\nManchuria](/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria \"Japanese invasion of\nManchuria\") in 1931, the [Second Italo-Ethiopian War](/wiki/Second_Italo-\nEthiopian_War \"Second Italo-Ethiopian War\") in 1935, the [Japanese invasion of\nChina](/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War \"Second Sino-Japanese War\") in 1937, and\nGerman expansions under [Adolf Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler \"Adolf Hitler\") that\nculminated in the [Second World War](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\").[9]\n\n### 1942 \"Declaration of United Nations\" by the Allies of World War II\n\nMain article: [Declaration by United\nNations](/wiki/Declaration_by_United_Nations \"Declaration by United Nations\")\n\nThe earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis\nof the [US State Department](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State \"United\nStates Department of State\") in 1939.[10] The text of the \"Declaration by\nUnited Nations\" was drafted by President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime\nMinister Winston Churchill, and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins, while meeting at\nthe White House, 29 December 1941. It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but\nleft no role for France. \"[Four Policemen](/wiki/Four_Policemen \"Four\nPolicemen\")\" was coined to refer to four major Allied countries, [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"), [Soviet\nUnion](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\"), and [Republic of\nChina](/wiki/Republic_of_China_\\(1912%E2%80%931949\\) \"Republic of China\n\\(1912–1949\\)\"), which emerged in the Declaration by United Nations.[11]\nRoosevelt first coined the term _United Nations_ to describe the [Allied\ncountries](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II \"Allies of World War II\").[b] \"On New\nYear's Day 1942, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, [Maxim\nLitvinov](/wiki/Maxim_Litvinov \"Maxim Litvinov\"), of the USSR, and [T.

One major change from the [Atlantic\nCharter](/wiki/Atlantic_Charter \"Atlantic Charter\") was the addition of a\nprovision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt\ninsisted.[13][14] By 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed.[15]\n\n> A JOINT DECLARATION BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM OF\n> GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS,\n> CHINA, AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, COSTA RICA, CUBA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA,\n> DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, EL SALVADOR, GREECE, GUATEMALA, HAITI, HONDURAS, INDIA,\n> LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS, NEW ZEALAND, NICARAGUA, NORWAY, PANAMA, POLAND,\n> SOUTH AFRICA, YUGOSLAVIA\n>\n> The Governments signatory hereto,\n>\n> Having subscribed to a common program of purposes and principles embodied in\n> the Joint Declaration of the President of the United States of America and\n> the Prime Minister of Great Britain dated August 14, 1941, known as the\n> Atlantic Charter,\n>\n> Being convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to\n> defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve\n> human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands, and\n> that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal\n> forces seeking to subjugate the world,\n>\n> DECLARE:\n>\n>   1.

Its site—like UN headquarters buildings in [Geneva](/wiki/Geneva\n\"Geneva\"), [Vienna](/wiki/Vienna \"Vienna\"), and [Nairobi](/wiki/Nairobi\n\"Nairobi\")—is designated as [international\nterritory](/wiki/International_territory \"International territory\").[24] The\nNorwegian Foreign Minister, [Trygve Lie](/wiki/Trygve_Lie \"Trygve Lie\"), was\nelected as the first UN Secretary-General.[21]\n\n### Cold War Era\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Dag-\nhammarskjold_2.jpg/170px-Dag-hammarskjold_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dag-\nhammarskjold_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dag-hammarskjold_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Dag Hammarskjöld](/wiki/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld \"Dag Hammarskjöld\") was a\nparticularly active Secretary-General from 1953 until his death in 1961.\n\nThough the UN's primary mandate was [peacekeeping](/wiki/Peacekeeping\n\"Peacekeeping\"), the division between the US and USSR often paralysed the\norganization, generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant\nfrom the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\").[25] (A notable exception was a\nSecurity Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to repel\nthe [North Korean invasion of South Korea](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\"),\npassed in the absence of the USSR.)[21][26] In 1947, the General Assembly\napproved [a resolution to partition\nPalestine](/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine \"United Nations\nPartition Plan for Palestine\"), approving the creation of the state of\n[Israel](/wiki/Israel \"Israel\"). Two years later, [Ralph\nBunche](/wiki/Ralph_Bunche \"Ralph Bunche\"), a UN official, negotiated an\narmistice to the resulting conflict.[27] In 1956, the [first UN peacekeeping\nforce](/wiki/United_Nations_Emergency_Force \"United Nations Emergency Force\")\nwas established to end the [Suez Crisis](/wiki/Suez_Crisis \"Suez Crisis\");[28]\nhowever, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous\ninvasion of Hungary following [that country's\nrevolution](/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 \"Hungarian Revolution of\n1956\").[29]\n\nIn 1960, the UN deployed [United Nations Operation in the\nCongo](/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_the_Congo \"United Nations Operation\nin the Congo\") (UNOC), the largest military force of its early decades, to\nbring order to the breakaway [State of Katanga](/wiki/State_of_Katanga \"State\nof Katanga\"), restoring it to the control of the [Democratic Republic of the\nCongo](/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo \"Democratic Republic of the\nCongo\") by 1964.[30] While travelling to meet rebel leader [Moise\nTshombe](/wiki/Moise_Tshombe \"Moise Tshombe\") during the conflict, [Dag\nHammarskjöld](/wiki/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld \"Dag Hammarskjöld\"), often named as\none of the UN's most effective Secretaries-General,[31] [died in a plane\ncrash](/wiki/1961_Ndola_United_Nations_DC-6_crash \"1961 Ndola United Nations\nDC-6 crash\"); months later he was posthumously awarded the [Nobel Peace\nPrize](/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize \"Nobel Peace Prize\").[32] In 1964,\nHammarskjöld's successor, [U Thant](/wiki/U_Thant \"U Thant\"), deployed the [UN\nPeacekeeping Force in\nCyprus](/wiki/United_Nations_Peacekeeping_Force_in_Cyprus \"United Nations\nPeacekeeping Force in Cyprus\"), which would become one of the UN's longest-\nrunning peacekeeping missions.[33]\n\nWith the spread of [decolonization](/wiki/Decolonization \"Decolonization\") in\nthe 1960s, the organization's membership saw an influx of newly independent\nnations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from\nAfrica.[28] On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but\nwith the support of many [Third World](/wiki/Third_World \"Third World\")\nnations, the mainland, communist [People's Republic of China](/wiki/China\n\"China\") was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the\n[Republic of China](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\") that occupied Taiwan; the vote was\nwidely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization.[34] Third\nWorld nations organized into the [Group of 77](/wiki/Group_of_77 \"Group of\n77\") coalition under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a\ndominant power at the UN.[35] In 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and Third\nWorld nations passed [a\nresolution](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379 \"United\nNations General Assembly Resolution 3379\"), over strenuous US and Israeli\nopposition, declaring [Zionism](/wiki/Zionism \"Zionism\") to be racism; the\nresolution was repealed in 1991, shortly after the end of the Cold War.[36]\n\nWith an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in\nconflicts in the [Middle East](/wiki/Six-Day_War \"Six-Day War\"),\n[Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\"), and [Kashmir](/wiki/Indo-\nPakistani_War_of_1965 \"Indo-Pakistani War of 1965\"), the UN increasingly\nshifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic\ndevelopment and cultural exchange.[37] By the 1970s, the UN budget for social\nand economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.\n\n### Post-Cold War\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Kofi_Annan.jpg/170px-\nKofi_Annan.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kofi_Annan.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kofi_Annan.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Kofi Annan](/wiki/Kofi_Annan \"Kofi Annan\"), Secretary-General from 1997 to\n2006\n\nAfter the Cold War, the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties,\ntaking on more missions in ten years than it had in the previous four\ndecades.[38] Between 1988 and 2000, the number of adopted Security Council\nresolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more than\ntenfold.[39][40][41] The UN negotiated an end to the [Salvadoran Civil\nWar](/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War \"Salvadoran Civil War\"), launched a successful\n[peacekeeping mission in\nNamibia](/wiki/United_Nations_Transition_Assistance_Group \"United Nations\nTransition Assistance Group\"), and oversaw democratic elections in\npost-[apartheid](/wiki/Apartheid_in_South_Africa \"Apartheid in South Africa\")\nSouth Africa and post-[Khmer Rouge](/wiki/Khmer_Rouge \"Khmer Rouge\")\nCambodia.[42] In 1991, the UN authorized a [US-led coalition](/wiki/Gulf_War\n\"Gulf War\") that repulsed the Iraqi [invasion of\nKuwait](/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait \"Invasion of Kuwait\").[43] [Brian\nUrquhart](/wiki/Brian_Urquhart \"Brian Urquhart\"), Under-Secretary-General from\n1971 to 1985, later described the hopes raised by these successes as a \"false\nrenaissance\" for the organization, given the more troubled missions that\nfollowed.[44]\n\nThough the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one\nnation against another, in the early 1990s the UN faced a number of\nsimultaneous, serious crises within nations such as Somalia, Haiti,\nMozambique, and the former Yugoslavia.[45] The [UN mission in\nSomalia](/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_Somalia_II \"United Nations\nOperation in Somalia II\") was widely viewed as a failure after the US\nwithdrawal following casualties in the [Battle of\nMogadishu](/wiki/Battle_of_Mogadishu_\\(1993\\) \"Battle of Mogadishu \\(1993\\)\"),\nand the [UN mission to Bosnia](/wiki/United_Nations_Protection_Force \"United\nNations Protection Force\") faced \"worldwide ridicule\" for its indecisive and\nconfused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing.[46] In 1994, the [UN\nAssistance Mission for\nRwanda](/wiki/United_Nations_Assistance_Mission_for_Rwanda \"United Nations\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda\") failed to intervene in the [Rwandan\ngenocide](/wiki/Rwandan_genocide \"Rwandan genocide\") amid indecision in the\nSecurity Council.[47]\n\nBeginning in the last decades of the Cold War, American and European critics\nof the UN condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and\ncorruption.[48] In 1984, the US President, [Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan\n\"Ronald Reagan\"), withdrew his nation's funding from [UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO\n\"UNESCO\") (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by\nBritain and Singapore.[49][50] [Boutros Boutros-Ghali](/wiki/Boutros_Boutros-\nGhali \"Boutros Boutros-Ghali\"), Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated\na reform of the Secretariat, reducing the size of the organization\nsomewhat.[51][52] His successor, [Kofi Annan](/wiki/Kofi_Annan \"Kofi Annan\")\n(1997–2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from\nthe United States to withhold its UN dues.[52]\n\nIn the late 1990s and 2000s, international interventions authorized by the UN\ntook a wider variety of forms. The [UN\nmission](/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_in_Sierra_Leone \"United Nations Mission\nin Sierra Leone\") in the [Sierra Leone Civil War](/wiki/Sierra_Leone_Civil_War\n\"Sierra Leone Civil War\") of 1991–2002 was supplemented by British [Royal\nMarines](/wiki/Royal_Marines \"Royal Marines\"), and the [invasion of\nAfghanistan in 2001](/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_\\(2001%E2%80%932014\\) \"War in\nAfghanistan \\(2001–2014\\)\") was overseen by [NATO](/wiki/NATO \"NATO\").[53]In\n2003, the United States [invaded Iraq](/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq \"2003\ninvasion of Iraq\") despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution\nfor authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of the organization's\neffectiveness.[54] Under the eighth Secretary-General, [Ban Ki-\nmoon](/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon \"Ban Ki-moon\"), the UN has intervened with\npeacekeepers in crises including the [War in Darfur](/wiki/War_in_Darfur \"War\nin Darfur\") in Sudan and the [Kivu conflict](/wiki/Kivu_conflict \"Kivu\nconflict\") in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical\nweapons inspectors to the [Syrian Civil War](/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War \"Syrian\nCivil War\").[55] In 2013, [an internal review](/wiki/Secretary-\nGeneral%27s_Internal_Review_Panel_on_United_Nations_Action_in_Sri_Lanka\n\"Secretary-General's Internal Review Panel on United Nations Action in Sri\nLanka\") of UN actions in [the final\nbattles](/wiki/Alleged_war_crimes_during_the_final_stages_of_the_Sri_Lankan_Civil_War\n\"Alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War\") of\nthe [Sri Lankan Civil War](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War \"Sri Lankan Civil War\")\nin 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered \"systemic failure\".[56]\nOne hundred and one UN personnel died in the [2010 Haiti\nearthquake](/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake \"2010 Haiti earthquake\"), the worst\nloss of life in the organization's history.[57]\n\nThe [Millennium Summit](/wiki/Millennium_Summit \"Millennium Summit\") was held\nin 2000 to discuss the UN's role in the 21st century.[58] The three day\nmeeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history, and culminated\nin the adoption by all member states of the [Millennium Development\nGoals](/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals \"Millennium Development Goals\")\n(MDGs), a commitment to achieve international development in areas such as\n[poverty reduction](/wiki/Poverty_reduction \"Poverty reduction\"), [gender\nequality](/wiki/Gender_equality \"Gender equality\"), and [public\nhealth](/wiki/Public_health \"Public health\"). Progress towards these goals,\nwhich were to be met by 2015, was ultimately uneven. The [2005 World\nSummit](/wiki/2005_World_Summit \"2005 World Summit\") reaffirmed the UN's focus\non promoting development, peacekeeping, human rights, and global security.[59]\nThe [Sustainable Development Goals](/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals\n\"Sustainable Development Goals\") were launched in 2015 to succeed the\nMillennium Development Goals.[60]\n\nIn addition to addressing global challenges, the UN has sought to improve its\naccountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society\nand fostering a global constituency.[61] In an effort to enhance transparency,\nin 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for\nSecretary-General.[62] On January 1, 2017, Portuguese diplomat [António\nGuterres](/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres \"António Guterres\"), who previously\nserved as [UN High Commissioner for\nRefugees](/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees \"United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees\"), became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres\nhas highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an\nemphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping\nefforts, and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile\nto global needs.[63]\n\n## Structure\n\nMain article: [United Nations System](/wiki/United_Nations_System \"United\nNations System\")\n\nThe UN system is based on five principal organs: the [General\nAssembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly \"United Nations General\nAssembly\"), the [Security Council](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council\n\"United Nations Security Council\"), the [Economic and Social\nCouncil](/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council \"United Nations\nEconomic and Social Council\") (ECOSOC), the\n[Secretariat](/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat \"United Nations Secretariat\"),\nand the [International Court of Justice](/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice\n\"International Court of Justice\").[64] A sixth principal organ, the\n[Trusteeship Council](/wiki/United_Nations_Trusteeship_Council \"United Nations\nTrusteeship Council\"), suspended operations in 1994, upon the independence of\n[Palau](/wiki/Palau \"Palau\"), the last remaining UN trustee territory.[65]\n\nFour of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in\nNew York City.[66] The International Court of Justice is located in [The\nHague](/wiki/The_Hague \"The Hague\"), while other major agencies are based in\nthe [UN offices at Geneva](/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Geneva \"United\nNations Office at Geneva\"),[67] [Vienna](/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Vienna\n\"United Nations Office at Vienna\"),[68] and\n[Nairobi](/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Nairobi \"United Nations Office at\nNairobi\").[69] Other UN institutions are located throughout the world. The six\n[official languages](/wiki/Official_language \"Official language\") of the UN,\nused in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are Arabic, Chinese,\nEnglish, French, Russian, and Spanish.[70] On the basis of the [Convention on\nthe Privileges and Immunities of the United\nNations](/wiki/Convention_on_the_Privileges_and_Immunities_of_the_United_Nations\n\"Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations\"), the UN\nand its agencies are [immune](/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity \"Diplomatic immunity\")\nfrom the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's\nimpartiality with regard to the host and member countries.[71]\n\nBelow the six organs sit, in the words of the author Linda Fasulo, \"an amazing\ncollection of entities and organizations, some of which are actually older\nthan the UN itself and operate with almost complete independence from it\".[72]\nThese include specialized agencies, research and training institutions,\nprogrammes and funds, and other UN entities.[73]\n\nThe UN obey the _Noblemaire principle_ , which is binding on any organization\nthat belongs to the UN system. This principle calls for salaries that will\ndraw and keep citizens of countries where salaries are highest, and also calls\nfor equal pay for work of equal value independent of the employee's\nnationality.[74][75] In practice, the\n[ICSC](/wiki/International_Civil_Service_Commission \"International Civil\nService Commission\") takes reference to the highest-paying national civil\nservice.[76] Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is\nadministered by the UN organizations.[74][77]\n\n**Principal organs of the United Nations** [78]\n\n  * [v](/wiki/Template:United_Nations_organs \"Template:United Nations organs\")\n  * [t](/wiki/Template_talk:United_Nations_organs \"Template talk:United Nations organs\")\n  * [e](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:United_Nations_organs&action=edit)\n\n**[UN General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly \"United Nations\nGeneral Assembly\")**  \n— [Deliberative assembly](/wiki/Deliberative_assembly \"Deliberative assembly\") of all UN member states — |  | **[UN Secretariat](/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat \"United Nations Secretariat\")**  \n— Administrative organ of the UN — |  | **[International Court of Justice](/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice \"International Court of Justice\")**  \n— Universal court for [international law](/wiki/International_law\n\"International law\") —  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[![UN General Assembly hall](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/UN_General_Assembly_hall.jpg/260px-UN_General_Assembly_hall.jpg)](/wiki/File:UN_General_Assembly_hall.jpg \"UN General Assembly hall\") |  [![Headquarters of the UN in New York City](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/United_Nations_Headquarters_in_New_York_City%2C_view_from_Roosevelt_Island.jpg/260px-United_Nations_Headquarters_in_New_York_City%2C_view_from_Roosevelt_Island.jpg)](/wiki/File:United_Nations_Headquarters_in_New_York_City,_view_from_Roosevelt_Island.jpg \"Headquarters of the UN in New York City\") |  [![International Court of Justice](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/International_Court_of_Justice.jpg/260px-International_Court_of_Justice.jpg)](/wiki/File:International_Court_of_Justice.jpg \"International Court of Justice\")  \n  \n  * May resolve non-compulsory recommendations to states or suggestions to the Security Council (UNSC);\n  * Decides on the admission of new members, following proposal by the UNSC;\n  * Adopts the budget;\n  * Elects the non-permanent members of the UNSC; all members of ECOSOC; the [UN Secretary General](/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations \"Secretary-General of the United Nations\") (following his/her proposal by the UNSC); and the fifteen judges of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9-year\nterms and are appointed by the General Assembly; every sitting judge must be\nfrom a different nation.[95][96]\n\nIt is based in the [Peace Palace](/wiki/Peace_Palace \"Peace Palace\") in The\nHague, sharing the building with the [Hague Academy of International\nLaw](/wiki/Hague_Academy_of_International_Law \"Hague Academy of International\nLaw\"), a private centre for the study of international law.

The president is elected for a one-year term and chosen amongst the\nsmall or middle powers represented on ECOSOC. The council has one annual\nmeeting in July, held in either New York or Geneva. Viewed as separate from\nthe specialized bodies it co-ordinates, ECOSOC's functions include information\ngathering, advising member nations, and making recommendations.[98][99] Owing\nto its broad mandate of co-ordinating many agencies, ECOSOC has at times been\ncriticized as unfocused or irrelevant.[98][100]\n\nECOSOC's subsidiary bodies include the [United Nations Permanent Forum on\nIndigenous Issues](/wiki/United_Nations_Permanent_Forum_on_Indigenous_Issues\n\"United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues\"), which advises UN\nagencies on issues relating to [indigenous peoples](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples\n\"Indigenous peoples\"); the [United Nations Forum on\nForests](/wiki/United_Nations_Forum_on_Forests \"United Nations Forum on\nForests\"), which co-ordinates and promotes sustainable forest management; the\n[United Nations Statistical\nCommission](/wiki/United_Nations_Statistical_Commission \"United Nations\nStatistical Commission\"), which co-ordinates information-gathering efforts\nbetween agencies; and the [Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment](/wiki/Commission_on_Sustainable_Development \"Commission on\nSustainable Development\"), which co-ordinates efforts between UN agencies and\nNGOs working towards [sustainable development](/wiki/Sustainable_development\n\"Sustainable development\"). ECOSOC may also grant consultative status to non-\ngovernmental organizations;[98] by 2004, more than 2,200 organizations had\nreceived this status.[101]\n\n### Specialized agencies\n\nMain article: [List of specialized agencies of the United\nNations](/wiki/List_of_specialized_agencies_of_the_United_Nations \"List of\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations\")\n\nThe UN Charter stipulates that each primary organ of the United Nations can\nestablish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties.[102] Some best-\nknown agencies are the [International Atomic Energy\nAgency](/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency \"International Atomic Energy\nAgency\"), the [Food and Agriculture\nOrganization](/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization \"Food and Agriculture\nOrganization\"), [UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO \"UNESCO\") (United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization), the [World Bank](/wiki/World_Bank_Group\n\"World Bank Group\"), and the [World Health\nOrganization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization \"World Health Organization\")\n(WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies.\nExamples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of\nfamine and malnutrition (through the work of the WFP), and the protection of\nvulnerable and displaced people (for example, by\n[UNHCR](/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees \"United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees\")).[103]\n\n**Organizations and specialized agencies of the United Nations** No. | Acronym | Agency | Headquarters | Head | Established in  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | FAO | **[Food and Agriculture Organization](/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization \"Food and Agriculture Organization\")** | [![Italy](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg/23px-Flag_of_Italy.svg.png)](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\") [Rome](/wiki/Rome \"Rome\"), [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\") | [![Brazil](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/22px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png)](/wiki/Brazil \"Brazil\") [José Graziano da Silva](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Graziano_da_Silva \"José Graziano da Silva\") | 1945  \n2 | IAEA | **[International Atomic Energy Agency](/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency \"International Atomic Energy Agency\")** | [![Austria](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_Austria.svg/23px-Flag_of_Austria.svg.png)](/wiki/Austria \"Austria\") [Vienna](/wiki/Vienna \"Vienna\"), [Austria](/wiki/Austria \"Austria\") | [![Japan](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg/23px-Flag_of_Japan.svg.png)](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") [Yukiya Amano](/wiki/Yukiya_Amano \"Yukiya Amano\") | 1957  \n3 | ICAO | **[International Civil Aviation Organization](/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization \"International Civil Aviation Organization\")** | [![Canada](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/23px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png)](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") [Montreal, Quebec](/wiki/Montreal,_Quebec \"Montreal, Quebec\"), [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") | [![China](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png)](/wiki/China \"China\") [Fang Liu](/wiki/Fang_Liu \"Fang Liu\") | 1947  \n4 | IFAD | **[International Fund for Agricultural Development](/wiki/International_Fund_for_Agricultural_Development \"International Fund for Agricultural Development\")** | [![Italy](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg/23px-Flag_of_Italy.svg.png)](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\") [Rome](/wiki/Rome \"Rome\"), [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\") | [![Nigeria](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Flag_of_Nigeria.svg/23px-Flag_of_Nigeria.svg.png)](/wiki/Nigeria \"Nigeria\") Kanayo F.

These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed \"Blue\nHelmets\" for their distinctive gear.[112][113] The peacekeeping force as a\nwhole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.[114]\n\nIn September 2013, the UN had peacekeeping soldiers deployed on 15 missions.\nThe largest was the [United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the\nCongo](/wiki/United_Nations_Organization_Stabilization_Mission_in_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo\n\"United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo\") (MONUSCO), which included 20,688 uniformed personnel.

UN\npeacekeepers with the [United Nations Truce Supervision\nOrganization](/wiki/United_Nations_Truce_Supervision_Organization \"United\nNations Truce Supervision Organization\") (UNTSO) have been stationed in the\nMiddle East since 1948, the longest-running active peacekeeping mission.[115]\n\nA study by the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be successful in two\nout of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by\nthe UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN\ncases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace.[116]\nAlso in 2005, the [Human Security Report](/wiki/Human_Security_Report_2005\n\"Human Security Report 2005\") documented a decline in the number of wars,\ngenocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and\npresented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly\nspearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict\nin that period.[117] Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the\npeace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the\nauthorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).[118]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/GreenLine_BufferZone_Large.JPG/210px-\nGreenLine_BufferZone_Large.JPG)](/wiki/File:GreenLine_BufferZone_Large.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GreenLine_BufferZone_Large.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[UN Buffer Zone in Cyprus](/wiki/UN_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus \"UN Buffer Zone in\nCyprus\") was established in 1974 following the [Turkish invasion of\nCyprus](/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus \"Turkish invasion of Cyprus\").\n\nThe UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures. In many cases, member\nstates have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council\nresolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and\nintervention are seen as having failed to prevent the [Bangladesh genocide in\n1971](/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_Genocide \"1971 Bangladesh Genocide\"),[119] the\n[Cambodian genocide](/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia \"Khmer Rouge rule of\nCambodia\") in the 1970s,[120] and the Rwandan genocide in 1994.[121]\nSimilarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the [Srebrenica\nmassacre](/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre \"Srebrenica massacre\") in 1995 or complete\nthe peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the [Somali Civil\nWar](/wiki/Somali_Civil_War \"Somali Civil War\").[122] UN peacekeepers have\nalso been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse\nduring various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo,[123] Haiti,[124] Liberia,[125] Sudan and what is now South Sudan,[126]\nBurundi, and Ivory Coast.[127] Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as\nthe likely source of the [2010–13 Haiti cholera\noutbreak](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9313_Haiti_cholera_outbreak \"2010–13 Haiti cholera\noutbreak\"), which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti\nearthquake.[128]\n\nIn addition to peacekeeping, the UN is also active in encouraging\n[disarmament](/wiki/Disarmament \"Disarmament\"). Regulation of armaments was\nincluded in the writing of the UN Charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way\nof limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation.[83]\nThe advent of [nuclear weapons](/wiki/Nuclear_weapon \"Nuclear weapon\") came\nonly weeks after the signing of the charter, resulting in the first\n[resolution](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_resolution \"United Nations\nGeneral Assembly resolution\") of the first General Assembly meeting calling\nfor specific proposals for \"the elimination from national armaments of atomic\nweapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction\".[129]\nThe UN has been involved with arms-limitation treaties, such as the [Outer\nSpace Treaty](/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty \"Outer Space Treaty\") (1967), the\n[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons](/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-\nProliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons \"Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons\") (1968), the [Seabed Arms Control\nTreaty](/wiki/Seabed_Arms_Control_Treaty \"Seabed Arms Control Treaty\") (1971),\nthe [Biological Weapons Convention](/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention\n\"Biological Weapons Convention\") (1972), the [Chemical Weapons\nConvention](/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention \"Chemical Weapons Convention\")\n(1992), and the [Ottawa Treaty](/wiki/Ottawa_Treaty \"Ottawa Treaty\") (1997),\nwhich prohibits landmines.[130] Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation\nissues: the [International Atomic Energy\nAgency](/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency \"International Atomic Energy\nAgency\"), the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\nWeapons](/wiki/Organization_for_the_Prohibition_of_Chemical_Weapons\n\"Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\"), and the\n[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory\nCommission](/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-\nBan_Treaty_Organization_Preparatory_Commission \"Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty Organization Preparatory Commission\").[131]\n\n### Human rights\n\nOne of the UN's primary purposes is \"promoting and encouraging respect for\nhuman rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to\nrace, sex, language, or religion\", and member states pledge to undertake\n\"joint and separate action\" to protect these rights.[102][132]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png/220px-\nEleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png)](/wiki/File:EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Eleanor Roosevelt](/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt \"Eleanor Roosevelt\") with the\n[Universal Declaration of Human\nRights](/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights \"Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights\") in Spanish, 1949\n\nIn 1948, the General Assembly adopted a [Universal Declaration of Human\nRights](/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights \"Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights\"), drafted by a committee headed by Franklin D. Roosevelt's\nwidow, [Eleanor](/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt \"Eleanor Roosevelt\"), and including\nthe French lawyer [René Cassin](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Cassin \"René Cassin\"). The\ndocument proclaims basic civil, political, and economic rights common to all\nhuman beings, though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been\ndisputed since its drafting.[133] The Declaration serves as a \"common standard\nof achievement for all peoples and all nations\" rather than a legally binding\ndocument, but it has become the basis of two binding treaties, the 1966\n[International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights](/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights\n\"International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\") and [International\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural\nRights](/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights\n\"International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\").[134] In\npractice, the UN is unable to take significant action against human rights\nabuses without a Security Council resolution, though it does substantial work\nin investigating and reporting abuses.[135]\n\nIn 1979, the General Assembly adopted the [Convention on the Elimination of\nAll Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen](/wiki/Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Discrimination_against_Women\n\"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\"),\nfollowed by the [Convention on the Rights of the\nChild](/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child \"Convention on the Rights\nof the Child\") in 1989.[136] With the end of the Cold War, the push for human\nrights action took on new impetus.[137] The [United Nations Commission on\nHuman Rights](/wiki/United_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights \"United Nations\nCommission on Human Rights\") was formed in 1993 to oversee human rights issues\nfor the UN, following the recommendation of that year's [World Conference on\nHuman Rights](/wiki/World_Conference_on_Human_Rights \"World Conference on\nHuman Rights\"). Jacques Fomerand, a scholar of the UN, describes this\norganization's mandate as \"broad and vague\", with only \"meagre\" resources to\ncarry it out.[138] In 2006, it was replaced by a [Human Rights\nCouncil](/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council \"United Nations Human\nRights Council\") consisting of 47 nations.[139] Also in 2006, the General\nAssembly passed a [Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous\nPeoples](/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Indigenous_Peoples \"Declaration on\nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples\"),[140] and in 2011 it passed its first\nresolution recognizing the rights of [LGBT](/wiki/LGBT \"LGBT\") people.[141]\n\nOther UN bodies responsible for [women's rights](/wiki/Women%27s_rights\n\"Women's rights\") issues include [United Nations Commission on the Status of\nWomen](/wiki/United_Nations_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women \"United Nations\nCommission on the Status of Women\"), a commission of ECOSOC founded in 1946;\nthe [United Nations Development Fund for\nWomen](/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Fund_for_Women \"United Nations\nDevelopment Fund for Women\"), created in 1976; and the [United Nations\nInternational Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of\nWomen](/wiki/United_Nations_International_Research_and_Training_Institute_for_the_Advancement_of_Women\n\"United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the\nAdvancement of Women\"), founded in 1979.[142] The UN Permanent Forum on\nIndigenous Issues, one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues\nrelated to indigenous peoples, held its first session in 2002.[143]\n\n### Economic development and humanitarian assistance\n\n**Millennium Development Goals[144]**  \n---  \n  \n  1.

In 1980, the agency\nannounced that the eradication of [smallpox](/wiki/Smallpox \"Smallpox\") had\nbeen completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated\n[polio](/wiki/Polio \"Polio\"), [river blindness](/wiki/River_blindness \"River\nblindness\"), and [leprosy](/wiki/Leprosy \"Leprosy\").[154] The [Joint United\nNations Programme on\nHIV/AIDS](/wiki/Joint_United_Nations_Programme_on_HIV/AIDS \"Joint United\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS\") (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the\norganization's response to the AIDS epidemic.[155] The [UN Population\nFund](/wiki/UN_Population_Fund \"UN Population Fund\"), which also dedicates\npart of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of\nfunding for [reproductive health](/wiki/Reproductive_health \"Reproductive\nhealth\") and [family planning](/wiki/Family_planning \"Family planning\")\nservices.[156]\n\nAlong with the [International Red Cross and Red Crescent\nMovement](/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement\n\"International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement\"), the UN often takes a\nleading role in co-ordinating emergency relief.[157] The [World Food\nProgramme](/wiki/World_Food_Programme \"World Food Programme\") (WFP), created\nin 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed\nconflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million\npeople in 80 nations each year.[157][158] The [Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for\nRefugees](/wiki/Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees\n\"Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\") (UNHCR),\nestablished in 1950, works to protect the rights of refugees, asylum seekers,\nand stateless people.[159] UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary\ncontributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the\nUNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.[160]\n\n### Other\n\nSince the UN's creation, over 80 colonies have attained independence.

The UN works towards decolonization through groups including\nthe [UN Committee on Decolonization](/wiki/Special_Committee_on_Decolonization\n\"Special Committee on Decolonization\"), created in 1962.[161] The committee\nlists seventeen remaining \"Non-Self-Governing Territories\", the largest and\nmost populous of which is [Western Sahara](/wiki/Western_Sahara \"Western\nSahara\").[162]\n\nBeginning with the formation of the [UN Environmental\nProgramme](/wiki/UN_Environmental_Programme \"UN Environmental Programme\")\n(UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its\nagenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led\nto the 1992 [Earth Summit](/wiki/Earth_Summit \"Earth Summit\") in Rio de\nJaneiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts.[163] In\n1988, the UNEP and the [World Meteorological\nOrganization](/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization \"World Meteorological\nOrganization\") (WMO), another UN organization,

financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from member\nstates. The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the\nassessment for each member. This is broadly based on the relative capacity of\neach country to pay, as measured by its [gross national\nincome](/wiki/Gross_national_income \"Gross national income\") (GNI), with\nadjustments for external debt and low per capita income.[168] The two-year\nbudget for 2012–13 was $5.512 billion in total.[169]\n\nThe Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly\ndependent on any one member to finance its operations. Thus, there is a\n\"ceiling\" rate, setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for\nthe regular budget. In December 2000, the Assembly revised the scale of\nassessments in response to pressure from the United States. As part of that\nrevision, the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25% to 22%.[170] For the\n[least developed countries](/wiki/Least_developed_country \"Least developed\ncountry\") (LDCs), a ceiling rate of 0.01% is applied.[168] In addition to the\nceiling rates, the minimum amount assessed to any member nation (or \"floor\"\nrate) is set at 0.001% of the UN budget ($55,120 for the two year budget\n2013–2014).[171]\n\nA large share of the UN's expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and\nsecurity, and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational\nbudget.[172] The peacekeeping budget for the 2015–16 fiscal year was $8.27\nbillion, supporting 82,318 troops deployed in 15 missions around the\nworld.[115] UN peace operations are funded by assessments, using a formula\nderived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for\nthe five permanent Security Council members, who must approve all peacekeeping\noperations. This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment\nrates for less developed countries. In 2017, the top 8 providers of assessed\nfinancial contributions to [UN peacekeeping](/wiki/Peacekeeping\n\"Peacekeeping\") operations were the [United States](/wiki/United_States\n\"United States\") (28.47%), [China](/wiki/China \"China\") (10.25%),\n[Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") (9.68%), [Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\")\n(6.39%), [France](/wiki/France \"France\") (6.28%), [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") (5.77%), [Russian\nFederation](/wiki/Russian_Federation \"Russian Federation\") (3.99%) and\n[Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\") (3.75%).[173]\n\nSpecial UN programmes not included in the regular budget, such as UNICEF and\nthe World Food Programme, are financed by voluntary contributions from member\ngovernments, corporations, and private individuals.[174][175]\n\n## Evaluations, awards, and criticism\n\nMain articles: [Reform of the United\nNations](/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations \"Reform of the United Nations\")\nand [Reform of the United Nations Security\nCouncil](/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council \"Reform of the\nUnited Nations Security Council\")\n\nSee also: [Criticism of the United\nNations](/wiki/Criticism_of_the_United_Nations \"Criticism of the United\nNations\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Friedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg/220px-\nFriedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg)](/wiki/File:Friedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Friedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[2001 Nobel Peace Prize](/wiki/2001_Nobel_Peace_Prize \"2001 Nobel Peace\nPrize\") to the UN – diploma in the lobby of the [UN\nHeadquarters](/wiki/Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations \"Headquarters of the\nUnited Nations\") in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\")\n\nA number of agencies and individuals associated with the UN have won the\n[Nobel Peace Prize](/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize \"Nobel Peace Prize\") in\nrecognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi\nAnnan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were\nRalph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, René Cassin (1968), a contributor to the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State [Cordell\nHull](/wiki/Cordell_Hull \"Cordell Hull\") (1945), the latter for his role in\nthe organization's founding. [Lester B. Pearson](/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson\n\"Lester B. Pearson\"), the Canadian [Secretary of State for External\nAffairs](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_External_Affairs \"Secretary of State for\nExternal Affairs\"), was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing\nthe UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the\nprize in 1965, the [International Labour\nOrganization](/wiki/International_Labour_Organization \"International Labour\nOrganization\") in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported\n[Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\nWeapons](/wiki/Organization_for_the_Prohibition_of_Chemical_Weapons\n\"Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\") in 2013. The UN High\nCommissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only\ntwo recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize\nin 2001, sharing it with Annan.[176]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/UN70.JPG/220px-\nUN70.JPG)](/wiki/File:UN70.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:UN70.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nTo mark the UN's 70th anniversary – Budapest, 2015\n\nSince its founding, there have been many calls for [reform of the\nUN](/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations \"Reform of the United Nations\") but\nlittle consensus on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more\neffective role in world affairs, while others want its role reduced to\nhumanitarian work. There have also been numerous calls for the [UN Security\nCouncil's membership to be\nincreased](/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council \"Reform of the\nUnited Nations Security Council\"), for different ways of electing the UN's\nSecretary-General, and for a [UN Parliamentary\nAssembly](/wiki/United_Nations_Parliamentary_Assembly \"United Nations\nParliamentary Assembly\"). Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in\nviews of the UN is \"the North–South split\" between [richer Northern nations\nand developing Southern nations](/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide \"North–South\ndivide\"). Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger\nGeneral Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while\nNorthern nations prefer an economically [laissez-faire](/wiki/Laissez-faire\n\"Laissez-faire\") UN that focuses on transnational threats such as\nterrorism.[177]\n\nAfter [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the [French Committee\nof National Liberation](/wiki/French_Committee_of_National_Liberation \"French\nCommittee of National Liberation\") was late to be recognized by the US as the\ngovernment of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the\nconferences that created the new organization. The future French president\n[Charles de Gaulle](/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle \"Charles de Gaulle\") criticized\nthe UN, famously calling it a _machin_ (\"contraption\"), and was not convinced\nthat a [global security](/wiki/Global_security \"Global security\") alliance\nwould help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between\ncountries.[178] Throughout the Cold War, both the US and USSR repeatedly\naccused the UN of favouring the other. In 1953, the USSR effectively forced\nthe resignation of Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General, through its refusal to\ndeal with him, while in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular US bumper sticker read,\n\"You can't spell communism without U.N.\"[179] In a sometimes-misquoted\nstatement, President [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\")\nstated in February 2003 (referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi\nprovocations under the Saddam Hussein regime) that \"free nations will not\nallow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating\nsociety.\"[180][181][182] In contrast, the French President, [François\nHollande](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Hollande \"François Hollande\"), stated in 2012\nthat \"France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how\npowerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and bring an end to\nall crises... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance.\"[183]\nCritics such as [Dore Gold](/wiki/Dore_Gold \"Dore Gold\"), an Israeli diplomat,\n[Robert S. Wistrich](/wiki/Robert_S._Wistrich \"Robert S. Wistrich\"), a British\nscholar, [Alan Dershowitz](/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz \"Alan Dershowitz\"), an\nAmerican legal scholar, [Mark Dreyfus](/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus \"Mark Dreyfus\"), an\nAustralian politician, and the [Anti-Defamation League](/wiki/Anti-\nDefamation_League \"Anti-Defamation League\") consider UN attention to Israel's\ntreatment of Palestinians to be excessive.[184] In September 2015, [Saudi\nArabia](/wiki/Saudi_Arabia \"Saudi Arabia\")'s Faisal bin Hassan Trad has been\nelected Chair of the [UN Human Rights\nCouncil](/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council \"United Nations Human\nRights Council\") panel that appoints independent experts,[185] a move\ncriticized by human rights groups.[186][187]\n\nSince 1971, the [Republic of China](/wiki/Republic_of_China \"Republic of\nChina\") (Taiwan) has been excluded from the UN and since then has always been\nrejected in new applications. Citizens of this country are also not allowed to\nenter the buildings of the United Nations with the passport of Taiwan. In this\nway, critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and\nguidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the [People's Republic\nof China](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China \"People's Republic of China\"),\nwhich regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own\nterritory.[188][189]\n\nCritics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and\ncorruption. In 1976, the General Assembly established the [Joint Inspection\nUnit](/wiki/Joint_Inspection_Unit \"Joint Inspection Unit\") to seek out\ninefficiencies within the UN system. During the 1990s, the US withheld dues\nciting inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major\nreforms initiative was introduced. In 1994, the [Office of Internal Oversight\nServices](/wiki/United_Nations_Office_of_Internal_Oversight_Services \"United\nNations Office of Internal Oversight Services\") (OIOS) was established by the\nGeneral Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog.[190] In 1994, former\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN to\n[Somalia](/wiki/Somalia \"Somalia\") [Mohamed Sahnoun](/wiki/Mohamed_Sahnoun\n\"Mohamed Sahnoun\") published \"Somalia: The Missed Opportunities\",[191] a book\nin which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention\nin [Somalia](/wiki/Somalia \"Somalia\"), showing that, between the start of the\nSomali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the [Siad Barre](/wiki/Siad_Barre\n\"Siad Barre\") regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three\nopportunities to prevent major human tragedies; when the UN tried to provide\nhumanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by [NGOs](/wiki/NGO\n\"NGO\"), whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN's\nexcessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not\nundertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the UN would continue to respond to\nsuch crisis with inept improvisation.[192] In 2004, the UN faced accusations\nthat its recently ended [Oil-for-Food Programme](/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Programme\n\"Oil-for-Food Programme\")—in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for\nbasic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions—had suffered from widespread\ncorruption, including billions of dollars of\n[kickbacks](/wiki/Kickback_\\(bribery\\) \"Kickback \\(bribery\\)\"). An independent\ninquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved,\nas well as raising \"significant\" questions about the role of [Kojo\nAnnan](/wiki/Kojo_Annan \"Kojo Annan\"), the son of Kofi Annan.[193]\n\nIn evaluating the UN as a whole, Jacques Fomerand writes that the\n\"accomplishments of the United Nations in the last 60 years are impressive in\ntheir own terms. Progress in human development during the 20th century has\nbeen dramatic and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world\nbecome a more hospitable and livable place for millions.\"[194] Evaluating the\nfirst 50 years of the UN's history, the author Stanley Meisler writes that _\"\nthe United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders, but it\naccomplished a great deal nevertheless\"_, citing its role in decolonization\nand its many successful peacekeeping efforts.[195] The British historian [Paul\nKennedy](/wiki/Paul_Kennedy \"Paul Kennedy\") states that while the organization\nhas suffered some major setbacks, \"when all its aspects are considered, the UN\nhas brought great benefits to our generation and ... will bring benefits to\nour children's and grandchildren's generations as well.\"[196]\n\n## See also\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/UN_emblem_blue.svg/32px-UN_emblem_blue.svg.png)[United Nations portal](/wiki/Portal:United_Nations \"Portal:United Nations\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Terra.png/28px-Terra.png)[International relations portal](/wiki/Portal:International_relations \"Portal:International relations\")\n\n  * [International relations](/wiki/International_relations \"International relations\")\n  * [List of current Permanent Representatives to the United Nations](/wiki/List_of_current_Permanent_Representatives_to_the_United_Nations \"List of current Permanent Representatives to the United Nations\")\n  * [Model United Nations](/wiki/Model_United_Nations \"Model United Nations\")\n  * [United Nations in popular culture](/wiki/United_Nations_in_popular_culture \"United Nations in popular culture\")\n  * [United Nations television film series](/wiki/United_Nations_television_film_series \"United Nations television film series\")\n  * [World Summit on the Information Society](/wiki/World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society \"World Summit on the Information Society\")\n  * [List of country groupings](/wiki/List_of_country_groupings \"List of country groupings\")\n  * [List of multilateral free-trade agreements](/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free-trade_agreements \"List of multilateral free-trade agreements\")\n  * [United Nations Memorial Cemetery](/wiki/United_Nations_Memorial_Cemetery \"United Nations Memorial Cemetery\")\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** This map does not represent the view of its members or the UN concerning the legal status of any country,[1] nor does it accurately reflect which areas' governments have UN representation.
