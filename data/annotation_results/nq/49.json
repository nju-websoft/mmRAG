The song features vocals from English-Jamaican singer\n[Rikrok](/wiki/Rikrok \"Rikrok\").\n\nThe [lyrics](/wiki/Lyrics \"Lyrics\") of the song depict one man asking his\nfriend what to do after his girlfriend caught him [having sex with another\nwoman](/wiki/Infidelity \"Infidelity\"). His friend's advice is to deny\neverything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't\nme.\"\n\n\"It Wasn't Me\" has been regarded as Shaggy's breakthrough in the pop market,\nand is his highest-charting song to date, topping the charts in\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"), [Austria](/wiki/Austria \"Austria\"),\n[France](/wiki/France \"France\"), [Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic\nof Ireland\"), the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), the\n[Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands \"Netherlands\"), and the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"). It was the best-selling\nsingle of 2001 in the United Kingdom, selling over 1.15 million copies that\nyear[2] and over 1.42 million as of 2017. The song was also featured on the\n2001 compilation album _[Now That's What I Call Music!\n6](/wiki/Now_That%27s_What_I_Call_Music!_6_\\(U.S._series\\) \"Now That's What I\nCall Music! 6 \\(U.S. series\\)\")_.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Chart performance\n  * 3 Music video\n  * 4 Legacy\n  * 5 Track listings\n  * 6 Charts and sales\n    * 6.1 Weekly charts\n    * 6.2 Year-end charts\n    * 6.3 Certifications\n    * 6.4 Chart successions\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Background[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It_Wasn%27t_Me&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nThe [lyrics](/wiki/Lyrics \"Lyrics\") of \"It Wasn't Me\" depict one man asking\nhis friend what to do after his girlfriend catches him having sex with another\nwoman. His friend's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to\nthe contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't me.\" Ultimately, the narrator says\nthat the advice \"makes no sense at all\". The song was inspired by a bit called\n\"No Loyal Men,\" performed by [Eddie Murphy](/wiki/Eddie_Murphy \"Eddie Murphy\")\nin his 1987 comedy special _[Raw](/wiki/Eddie_Murphy_Raw \"Eddie Murphy\nRaw\")_.[3] In a 2016 interview, Shaggy acknowledged similarities with the\n[War](/wiki/War_\\(band\\) \"War \\(band\\)\") song \"Smile Happy\".[4] The connection\nis further supported by [Liam Payne](/wiki/Liam_Payne \"Liam Payne\")'s 2017\ndebut single \"[Strip That Down](/wiki/Strip_That_Down \"Strip That Down\")\",\nitself based on \"It Wasn't Me\", which credited both Shaggy (as Orville\nBurrell) and members of War as co-songwriters.[5][6]\n\nThe clean version of the song replaces the lyric _\" Picture this: we were both\nbutt-naked banging on the bathroom floor\"_ with _\" Picture this: we were both\ncaught making love on the bathroom floor\"_ and _\" Saw me banging on the sofa\"_\nwith _\" Saw me kissing on the sofa\"_. \"It Wasn't Me\" was originally never\nintended to be released as a single.\n\nBefore the original version of _Hot Shot_ was released in August 2000,\nHawaiian DJ Pablo Sato downloaded the album from \"a [Napster](/wiki/Napster\n\"Napster\")-like MP3 site he won't name\" and discovered that \"It Wasn't Me\" was\n\"the album's standout cut.\" He played the song on American radio the next day,\nand in an interview, claimed, \"The phone lines lit up right away. Within a\ncouple of days, it was our number-one requested song.\"[7] The song was then\nreleased as the album's first single in September 2000, following its radio\nsuccess. The song is written in the key of C, in the [Mixolydian\nmode](/wiki/Mixolydian_mode \"Mixolydian mode\").\n\nThe song was spoofed by [Bob Rivers](/wiki/Bob_Rivers \"Bob Rivers\"), as\n_Shaggy One Handed_ , making a reference to the _[Scooby-Doo](/wiki/Scooby-Doo\n\"Scooby-Doo\")_ character, [Shaggy Rogers](/wiki/Shaggy_Rogers \"Shaggy\nRogers\"). The video focused on him being caught\n[masturbating](/wiki/Masturbating \"Masturbating\") (about the girl next door)\nby his mother.[8] The song was also spoofed on _[Svengoolie](/wiki/Svengoolie\n\"Svengoolie\")_. On _[The Chris Moyles Show](/wiki/The_Chris_Moyles_Show \"The\nChris Moyles Show\")_ , the song was used as a prank call with Shaggy trying to\nbook a taxi, with the final line being \"Can you drop me off at _The Chris\nMoyles Show_ on [BBC Radio 1](/wiki/BBC_Radio_1 \"BBC Radio 1\")?, 97 to 99\nFM\".[9]\n\n## Chart\nperformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It_Wasn%27t_Me&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Chart performance\")]\n\n\"It Wasn't Me\" was Shaggy's first number-one hit in the United States. The\nsong peaked at number two for two weeks from December 16, 2000[10] to December\n23, 2000.[11] On December 30, 2000, it was bumped down one position to number\nthree.[12] It moved back up to the number two spot on January 4, 2001.[13]\n\nThe song also reached number one on the [UK Singles\nChart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\") on March 4, 2001, selling\n345,000 copies, making the song a transatlantic chart-topper.[14] It also\nreached number one in [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") on April 1,\n2001. It is also the [11th biggest selling single of the 21st century in the\nUnited Kingdom](/wiki/List_of_best-\nselling_singles_of_the_2000s_\\(century\\)_in_the_United_Kingdom \"List of best-\nselling singles of the 2000s \\(century\\) in the United Kingdom\"),[15] with\nsales of over 1.42 million as of September 2017.[15]\n\nAs of August 2014, it is the 49th best-selling single of the 21st century in\nFrance, with 399,500 units sold.[16]\n\n## Music video[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It_Wasn%27t_Me&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Music video\")]\n\nThe music video was directed by Stephen Scott.\n\nIt starts out with Rikrok running to Shaggy's mansion to explain to him what\nhas just happened. Rikrok tells him that he cheated on his girlfriend and got\ncaught. Shaggy tells him to tell her that \"It wasn't me.\" The video then cuts\ninto a flashback to earlier that day. Rikrok has been caught sleeping with\nanother woman, and his girlfriend is outside the apartment in her convertible\nwhen two women pull up next to her on their motorcycles (sport bikes).\n\nThen, the three women go into the building. He then sneaks out the window,\ntakes the motorcycle of one of his girlfriends accomplices and leaves. The\nwomen come out and the girlfriend and one of the accomplices get in the\nconvertible and the other gets on her motorcycle and they chase after him.\nFrom his mansion, Shaggy, using his futuristic technology, tracks down where\nRikrok is going and prepares an escape for him. Rikrok then gets on a bridge\nover the highway when the accomplice rode on the bridge in front of him.\n\nHe then hits the brakes to stop while she stops her motorcycle. Rikrok then\nhears a noise behind him and it's the other accomplices and the girlfriend\ndriving the convertible on the other side of the bridge with the highway down\nbelow. An eighteen-wheeler drives by, and Shaggy leaves Rikrok a text message\ntelling him to look behind and he notices the truck and jumps off the side of\noverhead and lands on the truck. He is then dropped off at Shaggy's mansion,\nshowing the same scene from the start of the video.\n\n## Legacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It_Wasn%27t_Me&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Legacy\")]\n\nThe lyrics of \"It Wasn't Me\" inspired _[Slate](/wiki/Slate_\\(magazine\\) \"Slate\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ writer [Josh Levin](/wiki/Josh_Levin \"Josh Levin\") to coin the\nterm the \"[Shaggy defense](/wiki/Shaggy_defense \"Shaggy defense\")\" to describe\n[R. Kelly](/wiki/R._Kelly \"R. Kelly\")'s defence at his child pornography trial\nstemming from the production of a sex tape: \"I predict that in the decades to\ncome, law schools will teach this as the 'Shaggy defense'. You allege that I\nwas caught on camera, butt naked, banging on the log cabin floor? It wasn't\nme.\"[17]\n\nLevin repeated the term on [NPR](/wiki/NPR \"NPR\").[18] The term describes a\nstrategy of flatly denying guilt and refusing to engage with the evidence\nagainst the defendant, no matter how overwhelming. R. Kelly was ultimately\nfound not guilty on all charges.[19]\n\nThe song is referenced by [Trevor Noah](/wiki/Trevor_Noah \"Trevor Noah\") on an\nepisode of _[The Daily Show with Trevor\nNoah](/wiki/The_Daily_Show_with_Trevor_Noah \"The Daily Show with Trevor\nNoah\")_ when he covered the vice-presidential debate between [Mike\nPence](/wiki/Mike_Pence \"Mike Pence\") and [Tim Kaine](/wiki/Tim_Kaine \"Tim\nKaine\"), as Pence vehemently kept denying his running mate [Donald\nTrump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\")'s claims, despite the fact that the\nclaims have been proved to be said by Trump on camera or through his Twitter\naccount.[20]\n\n## Track\nlistings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It_Wasn%27t_Me&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Track listings\")]\n\n
