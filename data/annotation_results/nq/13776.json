The Newfoundland CCF was founded in 1955 when\n[Sam Drover](/wiki/Sam_Drover \"Sam Drover\"), a member of the [Newfoundland\nHouse of Assembly](/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_House_of_Assembly\n\"Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly\") for [White\nBay](/wiki/White_Bay_\\(Newfoundland_and_Labrador\\) \"White Bay \\(Newfoundland\nand Labrador\\)\") (Trinity North) who left the provincial [Liberal\nParty](/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador \"Liberal Party of\nNewfoundland and Labrador\") to sit as a member of the CCF. Drover became\nleader of the new provincial party, which fielded ten candidates, mostly in\nrural districts, in the [1956 provincial\nelection](/wiki/Newfoundland_general_election,_1956 \"Newfoundland general\nelection, 1956\"). The CCF party failed to win any seats: Drover lost his own\nriding, winning 237 votes to the Liberal candidate's 1,437.[3]\n\nThe CCF did not run candidates in the 1959 election, but supported the\n**Newfoundland Democratic Party**. This party had been organised by the\n[Newfoundland Federation of Labour](/wiki/Newfoundland_Federation_of_Labour\n\"Newfoundland Federation of Labour\") with the support of the [Canadian Labour\nCongress](/wiki/Canadian_Labour_Congress \"Canadian Labour Congress\"), to\nprotest the Liberal government's decertification of the [International\nWoodworkers of America](/wiki/International_Woodworkers_of_America\n\"International Woodworkers of America\") in the course of a logging\n[strike](/wiki/Strike_action \"Strike action\"). The Newfoundland Democratic\nParty ran eighteen candidates, none of whom was elected. The party was led by\n[Ed Finn, Jr.](/wiki/Ed_Finn,_Jr. \"Ed Finn, Jr.\") and [Calvin\nNormore](/w/index.php?title=Calvin_Normore_\\(politician\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Calvin Normore \\(politician\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\"). In 1961, the federal\n[New Democratic Party](/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_\\(Canada\\) \"New Democratic\nParty \\(Canada\\)\") was founded in with the merger of the federal CCF and the\n[Canadian Labour Congress](/wiki/Canadian_Labour_Congress \"Canadian Labour\nCongress\"). The Newfoundland Democratic Party followed suit becoming the\nNewfoundland New Democratic Party with Finn leading the NL NDP into the [1962\nprovincial election](/wiki/Newfoundland_general_election,_1962 \"Newfoundland\ngeneral election, 1962\") and Normore doing so in\n[1966](/wiki/Newfoundland_general_election,_1966 \"Newfoundland general\nelection, 1966\").[3]\n\n###\n1962–1984[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Newfoundland_and_Labrador_New_Democratic_Party&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1962–1984\")]\n\nSince the 1962 general election, the party has run candidates in all of\n[Newfoundland and Labrador's general\nelections](/wiki/List_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_general_elections \"List of\nNewfoundland and Labrador general elections\"). From 1962 to 1984 the party was\nled by seven different leaders and contested seven provincial elections. The\nparty won an average of 3.3% of the vote in those elections and were unable to\nelect a candidate to the [Newfoundland and Labrador House of\nAssembly](/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_House_of_Assembly \"Newfoundland and\nLabrador House of Assembly\").\n\n### Peter Fenwick\nyears[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Newfoundland_and_Labrador_New_Democratic_Party&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Peter Fenwick years\")]\n\n[Peter Fenwick](/wiki/Peter_Fenwick_\\(politician\\) \"Peter Fenwick\n\\(politician\\)\") succeeded [Fonse Faour](/wiki/Fonse_Faour \"Fonse Faour\") as\nparty leader in 1981. In a 1984 [by-election](/wiki/By-election \"By-\nelection\"), Fenwick won the [Labrador](/wiki/Labrador \"Labrador\") riding of\n[Menihek](/wiki/Labrador_West_\\(electoral_district\\) \"Labrador West\n\\(electoral district\\)\") becoming the first New Democrat to be elected in the\nprovince. In the [1985 general\nelection](/wiki/Newfoundland_general_election,_1985 \"Newfoundland general\nelection, 1985\") the party won 14 per cent of the popular vote, nearly\nquadrupling their share of the vote they received three years earlier. Even\nwith their successful results Fenwick was the only NL NDP candidate\nelected.[4][5] In 1986, [Gene Long](/wiki/Gene_Long \"Gene Long\") won the\nparty's second seat in a by-election in the riding of [St. John's\nEast](/wiki/St._John%27s_East_\\(provincial_electoral_district\\) \"St. John's\nEast \\(provincial electoral district\\)\") (since renamed [Signal Hill-Quidi\nVidi](/wiki/Signal_Hill-Quidi_Vidi \"Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi\")). Also that year\nFenwick was arrested, along with union representatives, for participating in a\nstrike by the Newfoundland Association of Public Employees (NAPE). Fenwick\nretired from politics in 1989 and did not run in [that year's\nelection](/wiki/Newfoundland_general_election,_1989 \"Newfoundland general\nelection, 1989\"). [Cle Newhook](/wiki/Cle_Newhook \"Cle Newhook\") replaced\nFenwick as party leader and the NL NDP was once again left without\nrepresentation after the 1989 election when both ridings they had held were\nwon by [Progressive\nConservatives](/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador\n\"Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador\").\n\n### Jack Harris\nyears[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Newfoundland_and_Labrador_New_Democratic_Party&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Jack Harris years\")]\n\nSt. John's lawyer and former [Member of Parliament](/wiki/Member_of_Parliament\n\"Member of Parliament\") [Jack\nHarris](/wiki/Jack_Harris_\\(Newfoundland_and_Labrador_politician\\) \"Jack\nHarris \\(Newfoundland and Labrador politician\\)\") won back the riding of [St.\nJohn's East](/wiki/Signal_Hill-Quidi_Vidi \"Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi\") in a 1990\nby-election after Progressive Conservative MHA [Shannie\nDuff](/wiki/Shannie_Duff \"Shannie Duff\") resigned to run for Mayor. Harris\ntook nearly 50% of the vote in the by-election beating the Liberal candidate\nby 740 votes. In 1992, Harris succeed Newhook as party leader and led the\nparty into the [1993 general\nelection](/wiki/Newfoundland_general_election,_1993 \"Newfoundland general\nelection, 1993\"). For the first and only time in the party's history they ran\na full slate of candidates throughout the province, while they won almost\n10,000 more votes than the previous election and increased their share of the\npopular vote from 3.4% to 7.4% Harris remained the only New Democrat elected.\nThe [1996 general election](/wiki/Newfoundland_general_election,_1996\n\"Newfoundland general election, 1996\") resulted in a landslide majority\ngovernment for the [Liberal\nParty](/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador \"Liberal Party of\nNewfoundland and Labrador\"), the New Democrats received only 4.45% of the vote\nand nominated candidates in only 20 of the provinces 48 ridings. Though the\nparty suffered their worst electoral result in 14 years Harris was easily re-\nelected in the new riding of [Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi](/wiki/Signal_Hill-\nQuidi_Vidi \"Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi\").\n\n### Lorraine\nMichael[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Newfoundland_and_Labrador_New_Democratic_Party&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Lorraine Michael\")]\n\nLorraine Michael [won the leadership of the Newfoundland and Labrador\nNDP](/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_leadership_election,_2006\n\"New Democratic Party of Newfoundland and Labrador leadership election, 2006\")\nin 2006. After succeeding Harris as leader she was elected in his former\ndistrict of Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi several months later. In the [2007\nprovincial election](/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_general_election,_2007\n\"Newfoundland and Labrador general election, 2007\") Michael was the only New\nDemocrat elected, though she increased her party's share of the popular vote.\nBetween 2007 and 2011 polling for the NL NDP remained below 10 per cent in\npublic opinion polls behind the Liberal Party and governing Progressive\nConservatives. However, after the federal New Democrat's success in the [2011\nfederal election](/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_2011 \"Canadian federal\nelection, 2011\"), where they formed the official opposition, support for\nMichael's New Democrats saw a surge in support. In a Corporate Research\nAssociates (CRA) poll conducted just weeks after the federal election in May\n2011, the NL NDP support rose to 20 per cent. For the first time in its\nhistory the party was statistically tied for second place with the [Liberal\nParty](/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador \"Liberal Party of\nNewfoundland and Labrador\"), who were at 22 per cent. The New Democrats' gains\ncame at the expense of the governing Progressive Conservatives who fell to 57\nper cent.[6] The NL NDP surpassed the Liberals in polling in September 2011,\nand won just under 25 per cent of the popular vote, and five seats, in the\n[October 11, 2011, general\nelection](/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_general_election,_2011 \"Newfoundland\nand Labrador general election, 2011\"). The Progressive Conservatives won their\nthird straight majority government and while the New Democrats placed second\nin the popular vote, they finished third behind the Liberal Party in seats.[7]\n\nOn October 21, 2013, it was revealed that Michael had received a letter from\nher caucus over the previous weekend calling for a leadership election to be\nheld in 2014. The caucus felt that without renewal in the party they would\nhave trouble attracting quality candidates and public support in the 2015\nelection. In an interview with the [Canadian Broadcasting\nCorporation](/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation \"Canadian Broadcasting\nCorporation\") (CBC), Michael said she was shocked by the letter and felt\nbetrayed by her caucus. Michael said she planned to sit down with her caucus\nbefore making a decision on what to do.[8]\n\nThe letter led to a public fight within the NDP, particularly among the\ncaucus. Both [Gerry Rogers](/wiki/Gerry_Rogers \"Gerry Rogers\") and [George\nMurphy](/wiki/George_Murphy_\\(Canadian_politician\\) \"George Murphy \\(Canadian\npolitician\\)\") said they regretted sending the letter and supported Michael,\nwhile [Dale Kirby](/wiki/Dale_Kirby \"Dale Kirby\") and [Chris\nMitchelmore](/wiki/Chris_Mitchelmore \"Chris Mitchelmore\") stood behind what\nthey had written in the letter. Following the caucus meeting Michael agreed to\nhaving a vote on her leadership at the next annual general meeting of the\nparty. Both Kirby and Mitchelmore later announced they were leaving the caucus\nto sit as Independent MHAs, and both men joined the Liberal Party in February\n2014. The dispute over Michael's leadership also led to members of the\nprovincial executive to resign.[9][10][11] In May 2014 a party convention\nreaffirmed her leadership with the support of 75% of delegates. Michael\nannounced on January 6, 2015, that she would step down as leader after the\nparty performed poorly in four recent by-elections. While she was resigning as\nleader Michael also stated that she planned to seek re-election as an MHA.[12]\nHer term as leader ended when her successor was chosen in a leadership\nelection held on March 7, 2015.[13]\n\n### Earle\nMcCurdy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Newfoundland_and_Labrador_New_Democratic_Party&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Earle McCurdy\")]\n\nMain article: [New Democratic Party of Newfoundland and Labrador leadership\nelection,\n2015](/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_leadership_election,_2015\n\"New Democratic Party of Newfoundland and Labrador leadership election, 2015\")\n\nThree candidates sought to succeed Michael as leader: former [Fish, Food and\nAllied Workers Union](/wiki/Fish,_Food_and_Allied_Workers_Union \"Fish, Food\nand Allied Workers Union\") leader [Earle McCurdy](/wiki/Earle_McCurdy \"Earle\nMcCurdy\"), former [Labrador City](/wiki/Labrador_City \"Labrador City\") town\ncouncillor Mike Goosney and former NDP official Chris Bruce[14][15]\n\nMcCurdy won the election with 68 percent of the vote on March 7, 2015. He did\nnot win his seat in the 2015 provincial election. Therefore, Michael\nsubsequently served as NDP House Leader in the following parliamentary\nsessions.\n\nOn September 19, 2017, McCurdy announced his resignation as Leader, effective\nSeptember 30, 2017.[16]\n\n## Party\npolicies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Newfoundland_and_Labrador_New_Democratic_Party&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Party policies\")]\n\nThe New Democratic Party in Newfoundland and Labrador has long been a party\nthat has advocated [social democratic](/wiki/Social_democracy \"Social\ndemocracy\") policies that support working people and families and the labour\nmovement.
