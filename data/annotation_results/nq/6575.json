It is an\n[adaptation](/wiki/Film_adaptation \"Film adaptation\") of the 1964 novel\n_[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory](/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory\n\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\")_ by [Roald Dahl](/wiki/Roald_Dahl \"Roald\nDahl\"). Dahl was credited with writing the film's screenplay; however, [David\nSeltzer](/wiki/David_Seltzer \"David Seltzer\"), who went uncredited in the\nfilm, was brought in to re-work the screenplay against Dahl's wishes, making\nmajor changes to the ending and adding musical numbers. These changes and\nother decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film.[4][5]\n\nThe film tells the story of Charlie Bucket ([Peter Ostrum](/wiki/Peter_Ostrum\n\"Peter Ostrum\")) as he receives a Golden Ticket and visits Willy Wonka's\nchocolate factory with four other children from around the world. Filming took\nplace in [Munich](/wiki/Munich \"Munich\") in 1970, and the film was released by\n[Paramount Pictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\") on June\n30, 1971. With a budget of just $3 million, the film received generally\npositive reviews and earned $4 million by the end of its original run. The\nfilm became highly popular in part through repeated television airings and\nhome entertainment sales.[6] In 1972, the film received an [Academy\nAward](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\") nomination for [Best Original\nScore](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Original_Music_Score \"Academy Award for\nOriginal Music Score\"), and Wilder was nominated for a [Golden Globe as Best\nActor in a Musical or\nComedy](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_%E2%80%93_Motion_Picture_Musical_or_Comedy\n\"Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\"), but\nlost both to _[Fiddler on the Roof](/wiki/Fiddler_on_the_Roof_\\(film\\)\n\"Fiddler on the Roof \\(film\\)\")_. The film also introduced the song \"[The\nCandy Man](/wiki/The_Candy_Man \"The Candy Man\")\", which went on to become a\npopular hit when recorded by [Sammy Davis Jr.](/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr. \"Sammy\nDavis Jr.\") In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United\nStates [National Film Registry](/wiki/National_Film_Registry \"National Film\nRegistry\") by the [Library of Congress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library of\nCongress\") as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Cast\n    * 2.1 Oompa Loompas\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Development\n    * 3.2 Casting\n    * 3.3 Filming\n    * 3.4 Promotion\n  * 4 Reception\n    * 4.1 Dahl's reaction\n  * 5 Animated adaptation\n  * 6 Home media\n  * 7 Music\n  * 8 Soundtrack\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 Notes\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n##\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nIn a small town, Charlie Bucket, a poor paperboy, watches a group of children\nvisit a candy shop. Walking home, he passes [Willy Wonka](/wiki/Willy_Wonka\n\"Willy Wonka\")'s chocolate factory. A mysterious tinker recites the first\nlines of [William Allingham](/wiki/William_Allingham \"William Allingham\")'s\npoem \"The Fairies\", and tells Charlie, \"Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever\ncomes out.\" Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother and\n[bedridden](/wiki/Bedridden \"Bedridden\") grandparents. After telling Grandpa\nJoe about the tinker, Joe reveals that Wonka locked the factory because other\ncandy makers, including rival Arthur Slugworth, sent in spies to steal his\nrecipes. Wonka disappeared, but after three years resumed selling candy; the\norigin of Wonka's labor force is unknown.\n\nThe next day, Wonka announces that he hid five \"Golden Tickets\" in chocolate\n[Wonka Bars](/wiki/Wonka_Bar \"Wonka Bar\"). Finders of the tickets will receive\na factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four tickets are\nfound by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the gum-\nchewing Violet Beauregarde, and the television-obsessed Mike Teevee. As each\nwinner is announced on TV, a man whispers to them. Charlie opens two Wonka\nBars but finds no Golden Ticket. The newspapers announce the fifth ticket was\nfound by a millionaire in [Paraguay](/wiki/Paraguay \"Paraguay\") causing\nCharlie to lose hope. The next day, Charlie finds money in a sewer and uses it\nto buy a Scrumdiddlyumptious bar. With the change, he buys another Wonka Bar\nfor Joe. Walking home, as Charlie hears people reading the newspapers;\nrevealing that the Paraguayan millionaire's ticket is a fake, he opens the\nWonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket. While rushing home, he encounters\nthe same man seen whispering to the other winners, who introduces himself as\nSlugworth and offers a reward for a sample of Wonka's latest creation, the\n[Everlasting Gobstopper](/wiki/Everlasting_Gobstopper \"Everlasting\nGobstopper\").\n\nReturning home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Joe as his chaperone.\nThe next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners and leads them inside where each\nsigns a contract before the tour. The factory includes a river of chocolate,\nedible mushrooms, lickable wallpaper, and other sweets and inventions. As the\nvisitors sample these, they see Wonka's workers, small men known as [Oompa-\nLoompas](/wiki/Oompa-Loompa \"Oompa-Loompa\"). Augustus falls into the chocolate\nriver and is sucked up a pipe to the Fudge Room. In the Inventing Room,\neveryone receives an Everlasting Gobstopper. Violet becomes a large blueberry\nafter chewing an experimental gum containing a three-course meal, over Wonka's\nwarnings. The group reaches the Fizzy Lifting Drinks Room, where Charlie and\nJoe ignore Wonka's warning and sample the drinks. They float and have a near-\nfatal encounter with an exhaust fan before burping back to the ground. In the\nChocolate Eggs Room, Veruca demands a golden goose for herself before falling\ninto a garbage chute leading to the furnace, with her father falling in trying\nto rescue her. The group tests out Wonka's Wonkavision, only for Mike to\nteleport himself and become a few inches tall.\n\nWith Charlie and Joe remaining, Wonka says they are not getting anything\nbecause they violated the contract by stealing the Fizzy Lifting Drinks.\nInfuriated by this, Joe suggests to Charlie that he should give Slugworth the\nGobstopper in revenge, but Charlie returns the candy back to Wonka. With this\nselfless act, Wonka declares Charlie as the winner. He reveals that Slugworth\nis actually Mr. Wilkinson, an employee of Wonka, and the offer to buy the\nGobstopper was a morality test that only Charlie passed. The trio enter the\n\"Wonkavator\", a multi-directional glass elevator that flies out of the\nfactory. Soaring over the city, Wonka reveals that his actual prize is the\nfactory; Wonka created the contest to find an heir worthy enough, and so\nCharlie and his family can immediately move in. Wonka then reminds Charlie not\nto forget about the man who suddenly received everything he ever wanted.\nCharlie asks, \"What happened?\" to which Wonka replies, \"He lived happily ever\nafter.\"\n\n  \n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/Main_Cast_of_Willy_Wonka_and_the_Chocolate_Factory.jpg/220px-\nMain_Cast_of_Willy_Wonka_and_the_Chocolate_Factory.jpg)](/wiki/File:Main_Cast_of_Willy_Wonka_and_the_Chocolate_Factory.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Main_Cast_of_Willy_Wonka_and_the_Chocolate_Factory.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe main cast.  \nBack row (left to right): Michael Bollner, Ursula Reit, Gene Wilder  \nFront row (left to right): Leonard Stone, Denise Nickerson, Roy Kinnear, Julie\nDawn Cole, Dodo Denny, Paris Themmen, Peter Ostrum, Jack Albertson\n\nMain article: [List of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_characters \"List\nof Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters\")\n\n  * [Gene Wilder](/wiki/Gene_Wilder \"Gene Wilder\") as [Willy Wonka](/wiki/Willy_Wonka \"Willy Wonka\")\n  * [Jack Albertson](/wiki/Jack_Albertson \"Jack Albertson\") as [Grandpa Joe](/wiki/Grandpa_Joe \"Grandpa Joe\")\n  * [Peter Ostrum](/wiki/Peter_Ostrum \"Peter Ostrum\") as [Charlie Bucket](/wiki/Charlie_Bucket \"Charlie Bucket\")\n  * [Roy Kinnear](/wiki/Roy_Kinnear \"Roy Kinnear\") as Henry Salt\n  * [Julie Dawn Cole](/wiki/Julie_Dawn_Cole \"Julie Dawn Cole\") as [Veruca Salt](/wiki/Veruca_Salt_\\(character\\) \"Veruca Salt \\(character\\)\")\n  * [Leonard Stone](/wiki/Leonard_Stone \"Leonard Stone\") as Sam Beauregarde\n  * [Denise Nickerson](/wiki/Denise_Nickerson \"Denise Nickerson\") as [Violet Beauregarde](/wiki/Violet_Beauregarde \"Violet Beauregarde\")\n  * [Dodo Denney](/wiki/Nora_Denney \"Nora Denney\") as Mrs. Teevee\n  * [Paris Themmen](/wiki/Paris_Themmen \"Paris Themmen\") as [Mike Teevee](/wiki/Mike_Teavee \"Mike Teavee\")\n  * [Ursula Reit](/wiki/Ursula_Reit \"Ursula Reit\") as Mrs. Gloop\n  * Michael Bollner as [Augustus Gloop](/wiki/Augustus_Gloop \"Augustus Gloop\")\n  * [Diana Sowle](/wiki/Diana_Sowle \"Diana Sowle\") as Mrs. Bucket\n  * [Aubrey Woods](/wiki/Aubrey_Woods \"Aubrey Woods\") as Bill, the Candy Shop owner\n  * [David Battley](/wiki/David_Battley \"David Battley\") as [Mr. Turkentine](/wiki/List_of_Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_characters#Mr._Turkentine \"List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters\")\n  * [Günter Meisner](/wiki/G%C3%BCnter_Meisner \"Günter Meisner\") as Arthur Slugworth/Mr. Wilkinson\n  * [Peter Capell](/wiki/Peter_Capell \"Peter Capell\") as The Tinker\n  * [Werner Heyking](/wiki/Werner_Heyking \"Werner Heyking\") as Mr. Jopeck\n  * Peter Stuart as Winkelmann\n\n### Oompa\nLoompas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Oompa Loompas\")]\n\n  * [Rusty Goffe](/wiki/Rusty_Goffe \"Rusty Goffe\")\n  * Rudy Borgstaller\n  * [George Claydon](/wiki/George_Claydon \"George Claydon\")\n  * [Malcolm Dixon](/wiki/Malcolm_Dixon_\\(actor\\) \"Malcolm Dixon \\(actor\\)\")\n  * Ismed Hassan\n  * Norman McGlen\n  * [Angelo Muscat](/wiki/Angelo_Muscat \"Angelo Muscat\")\n  * Pepe Poupee\n  * Marcus Powell\n  * Albert Wilkinson\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nThe idea for [adapting the book into a film](/wiki/Film_adaptation \"Film\nadaptation\") came about when director [Mel Stuart's](/wiki/Mel_Stuart \"Mel\nStuart\") ten-year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a\nfilm out of it, with \"Uncle Dave\" (producer [David L.\nWolper](/wiki/David_L._Wolper \"David L.

Stuart showed\nthe book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the [Quaker\nOats Company](/wiki/Quaker_Oats_Company \"Quaker Oats Company\") regarding a\nvehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago\n\"Chicago\")-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (since renamed [the Willy\nWonka Candy Company](/wiki/The_Willy_Wonka_Candy_Company \"The Willy Wonka\nCandy Company\") and sold to [Nestlé](/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9 \"Nestlé\")). Wolper\npersuaded the company, which had no previous experience in the film industry,\nto buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of\npromoting a new Quaker Oats _Wonka Bar_.[7]\n\nIt was agreed that the film would be a children's musical, and that Dahl\nhimself would write the screenplay.[7] However, the title was changed to\n_Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory_.\n\nScreenwriter [David Seltzer](/wiki/David_Seltzer \"David Seltzer\") conceived a\ngimmick exclusively for the film that had Wonka quoting numerous literary\nsources, such as [Arthur O'Shaughnessy](/wiki/Arthur_O%27Shaughnessy \"Arthur\nO'Shaughnessy\")'s _[Ode](/wiki/Ode_\\(poem\\) \"Ode \\(poem\\)\")_ , [Oscar\nWilde](/wiki/Oscar_Wilde \"Oscar Wilde\")'s _[The Importance of Being\nEarnest](/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest \"The Importance of Being\nEarnest\")_ , [Samuel Taylor Coleridge](/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge \"Samuel\nTaylor Coleridge\")'s _[The Rime of the Ancient\nMariner](/wiki/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner \"The Rime of the Ancient\nMariner\")_ and [William Shakespeare](/wiki/William_Shakespeare \"William\nShakespeare\")'s _[The Merchant of Venice](/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice \"The\nMerchant of Venice\")_. Seltzer also worked Slugworth (only mentioned as a\nrival candy maker in the book) into the plot as an actual character (only to\nbe revealed to be Wilkinson, one of Wonka's agents, at the end of the\nfilm).[7]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\nAll six members of [Monty Python](/wiki/Monty_Python \"Monty Python\"): [Graham\nChapman](/wiki/Graham_Chapman \"Graham Chapman\"), [John\nCleese](/wiki/John_Cleese \"John Cleese\"), [Eric Idle](/wiki/Eric_Idle \"Eric\nIdle\"), [Terry Gilliam](/wiki/Terry_Gilliam \"Terry Gilliam\"), [Terry\nJones](/wiki/Terry_Jones \"Terry Jones\") and [Michael\nPalin](/wiki/Michael_Palin \"Michael Palin\"), expressed interest in playing\nWonka, but at the time they were deemed not big enough names for an\ninternational audience. Three of the members, Cleese, Idle and Palin, were\nlater seriously considered for the same role in [Tim Burton's\nversion](/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_\\(film\\) \"Charlie and the\nChocolate Factory \\(film\\)\").[8][9]\n\nBefore Wilder was officially cast for the role, producers considered [Fred\nAstaire](/wiki/Fred_Astaire \"Fred Astaire\"), [Joel Grey](/wiki/Joel_Grey \"Joel\nGrey\"), [Ron Moody](/wiki/Ron_Moody \"Ron Moody\") and [Jon\nPertwee](/wiki/Jon_Pertwee \"Jon Pertwee\").[9][10] [Spike\nMilligan](/wiki/Spike_Milligan \"Spike Milligan\") was Roald Dahl's original\nchoice to play Willy Wonka.[9] [Peter Sellers](/wiki/Peter_Sellers \"Peter\nSellers\") even begged Dahl for the role.[11]\n\nWhen Wilder was cast for the role, he accepted it on one condition:\n\n> When I make my first entrance, I'd like to come out of the door carrying a\n> cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy\n> Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly\n> quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I'm\n> walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I\n> realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just\n> before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back\n> up, to great applause.\n>\n> — Gene Wilder[12]\n\nThe reason why Wilder wanted this in the film was that \"from that time on, no\none will know if I'm lying or telling the truth.\"[12]\n\n[Jean Stapleton](/wiki/Jean_Stapleton \"Jean Stapleton\") turned down the role\nof Mrs. Teevee.[13][14] [Jim Backus](/wiki/Jim_Backus \"Jim Backus\") was\nconsidered for the role of Sam Beauregarde.[15] [Sammy Davis,\nJr.](/wiki/Sammy_Davis,_Jr. \"Sammy Davis, Jr.\") wanted to play Bill, the candy\nstore owner, but Stuart did not like the idea because he felt that the\npresence of a big star in the candy store scene would break the reality.[8]\nNevertheless, Davis' recording of the film's opening musical number, \"The\nCandy Man,\" would top the _[Billboard magazine](/wiki/Billboard_magazine\n\"Billboard magazine\")_ record charts in 1972, despite the fact that Davis\ninitially hated the song. [Anthony Newley](/wiki/Anthony_Newley \"Anthony\nNewley\") also wanted to play Bill, but Stuart also objected to this for the\nsame reason.[15]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\ncommenced on August 31, 1970, and ended on November 19, 1970. The primary\nshooting location was [Munich](/wiki/Munich \"Munich\"), [Bavaria](/wiki/Bavaria\n\"Bavaria\"), [West Germany](/wiki/West_Germany \"West Germany\"), because it was\nsignificantly cheaper than filming in the United States and the setting was\nconducive to Wonka's factory; Stuart also liked the ambiguity and\nunfamiliarity of the location. External shots of the factory were filmed at\nthe [gasworks](/wiki/Gasworks \"Gasworks\") of [Stadtwerke\nMünchen](/wiki/Stadtwerke_M%C3%BCnchen \"Stadtwerke München\") (Emmy-Noether-\nStraße 10); the entrance and side buildings still exist.
