Gabriel Oak ([Matthias\nSchoenaerts](/wiki/Matthias_Schoenaerts \"Matthias Schoenaerts\")), a new\nneighbour, sees Bathsheba riding her horse and falls in love with her. He\nproposes, but the headstrong Bathsheba declines, saying she is too independent\nand he would grow to despise her. One night a new sheepdog chases Gabriel's\nentire flock off a cliff. He settles his debts and is left penniless. He\nleaves in search of work. In contrast, Bathsheba inherits a farm from her\nuncle and leaves to take charge of it.\n\nWhile Gabriel is at a fair trying to find employment, local soldiers attempt\nto recruit him and other townsmen. A young girl, Fanny Robin, notices him and\npoints out one of the soldiers, Sergeant Frank Troy, her sweetheart. She\nsuggests Gabriel seek employment at a farm in Weatherbury. Gabriel arrives to\nfind several buildings on fire and saves the barn from destruction. At dawn\nthe next day he is introduced to the farm's new mistress: Bathsheba. She hires\nhim as a shepherd. In the meantime, Fanny goes to the wrong church for her\nwedding and Troy, apparently jilted, is devastated.\n\nIn town, Bathsheba proves to be a shrewd trader when selling her seed. She\nimmediately is drawn to her neighbour William Boldwood ([Michael\nSheen](/wiki/Michael_Sheen \"Michael Sheen\")), a prosperous and mature\nbachelor. Bathsheba sends Boldwood a [Valentine](/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day\n\"Valentine's Day\") as a joke, and he, both offended and intrigued, soon\nproposes marriage. Bathsheba says she does share his feelings but delays\ngiving him a final answer. Gabriel admonishes Bathsheba for being foolish and\nunkind by playing with Boldwood's affections. She is stung by his criticism,\nand fires him, but the next day, given a crisis with the sheep that only he\ncan manage, she sends after him and then pursues him to ask him to return.\nAfter her personal appeal, he comes back, saves some of the sheep, and stays\non the farm.\n\nOne night while walking around her land, Bathsheba meets Troy, who is\nmesmerized by her beauty. Uncomfortable, she tells him he should not be there,\nbut the next day he returns to help with the harvest. Bathsheba learns he is\nof a noble family, but tells him to leave. He flirts with her and flatters\nher, and arranges a secret meeting. At their rendezvous in the woods, he shows\noff his swordplay, telling her not to flinch as he swings his sword around her\nhead and body. He finally embraces her in a passionate kiss and Bathsheba is\nleft in a daze. Gabriel warns her that Frank is dangerous and dishonourable,\nbut she nevertheless elopes with him, and they share their wedding night\ntogether.\n\nReturning to the farm, the newly married couple celebrate with all the\nworkers. Gabriel warns of an approaching storm, but the belligerent and drunk\nFrank interrupts him and insists that the party will not allow it to rain.\nGabriel attempts by himself to cover the harvest with tarpaulins and\nBathsheba, ashamed of Frank's drunken behavior with the other men, comes out\ninto the wind and rain to help. Chastened, she tells Gabriel that she was a\nfool to fall prey to Frank's flattery.\n\nOne day in town, Frank sees Fanny begging. She tells him she had gone to the\nwrong church, and that she is pregnant with his baby. He promises her he will\nfind a home for them, and that she should stay in the\n[workhouse](/wiki/Workhouse \"Workhouse\") in the meantime. Frank, a degenerate\ngambler, asks Bathsheba for £20 and she refuses, saying the money is for farm\nexpenses. Fanny and her baby die in childbirth; their coffin is delivered to\nBathsheba's farm, which was her last known address. Bathsheba recognizes the\nname as one of her uncle's loyal servants and says the coffin should be\nbrought inside for mourning. The words \"Fanny Robin and child\" are written on\nthe coffin, but Gabriel surreptitiously erases \"and child\" from the slate\nwhile bringing it in. Bathsheba reads the erasure, opens the coffin, and\ndiscovers the mother and baby within. Frank, upon seeing Fanny and his dead\nbaby, bends over the coffin and kisses Fanny's lips. Bathsheba protests that\nshe is still his wife, but he coldly responds that even in death Fanny means\nmore to him than Bathsheba ever had meant or ever could mean. In grief Frank\ngoes to the beach, where he strips off his uniform and swims far into the\nocean. The next day the constable arrives to inform Bathsheba that Frank has\napparently drowned.\n\nLeft with Frank's gambling debts, Bathsheba worries she may lose the farm.\nBoldwood offers to buy it and merge it with his property, offering Gabriel a\nposition as bailiff, and again proposes marriage. Bathsheba agrees to consider\nhis offer. On the eve of the Christmas party he plans to throw, Boldwood\nshares with Gabriel that he knows of the affection he feels for Bathsheba, but\nadds he appreciates that he has been such a gentleman in the entire matter,\nand shows Gabriel the engagement ring he plans to offer her.\n\nAt the party, Boldwood graciously invites Gabriel and Bathsheba to share at\nleast one dance. As they dance, she again asks Gabriel what she should do, and\nhe answers simply to \"Do what is right\". She breaks off the dance and leaves,\nonly to discover Frank, alive and well, slumbering up the pathway, outside. He\nwas rescued from drowning but has faked his death for some weeks, preferring\nthe idea of being 'dead.' Regretting his decision, he has returned and demands\nmoney from Bathsheba, claiming it was unfair that he gave up his profession\nfor her and now lives off nothing while she has money and a house. When she\ninsists she has no money, Frank demands that she sell the farm and grabs her\nroughly, screaming that she is still his wife and must obey him. Enraged,\nBoldwood emerges from the house and kills Frank with a single blast from his\nrifle, for which he is promptly imprisoned. As Gabriel witnesses all the\nfinery, many dresses and jewellery, that Boldwood had already laid out\nupstairs in anticipation of Bathsheba's 'yes' answer, Bathsheba is remorseful\nand guiltridden. Gabriel tells her that if it's any consolation Boldwood is\nbound to be spared his life, for acting in a 'crime of passion'.\n\nSome time later, Gabriel announces that since the farm is now secure, he'll be\nemigrating to America in four days time. As he leaves on foot early in the\nmorning, Bathsheba stays at the farm battling her feelings and stubbornness.\nFinally, she chases after him on horseback and begs him not to leave, thanking\nhim for all he's done for her, and always believing in her. Gabriel tells her,\nif only she would accept his love, then asks her if she would agree were he to\npropose again. Bathsheba smiles and tells him he needs ask once more. Gabriel\nkisses her passionately in response, and they walk back hand in hand.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Far_from_the_Madding_Crowd_\\(2015_film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Carey Mulligan](/wiki/Carey_Mulligan \"Carey Mulligan\") as Bathsheba Everdene\n  * [Matthias Schoenaerts](/wiki/Matthias_Schoenaerts \"Matthias Schoenaerts\") as Gabriel Oak\n  * [Michael Sheen](/wiki/Michael_Sheen \"Michael Sheen\") as William Boldwood\n  * [Tom Sturridge](/wiki/Tom_Sturridge \"Tom Sturridge\") as Sergeant Frank Troy\n  * [Juno Temple](/wiki/Juno_Temple \"Juno Temple\") as Fanny Robin\n  * [Jessica Barden](/wiki/Jessica_Barden \"Jessica Barden\") as Liddy\n  * [Sam Phillips](/wiki/Sam_Phillips_\\(actor\\) \"Sam Phillips \\(actor\\)\") as Sergeant Doggett\n  * [Tilly Vosburgh](/wiki/Tilly_Vosburgh \"Tilly Vosburgh\") as Mrs. Hurst\n  * Rowan Hedley as Maryann Money\n  * Chris Gallarus as Billy Smallbury\n  * Connor Webb as Merchant\n  * Penny-Jane Swift as Mrs. Coggan\n  * Rosie Masson as Soberness Miller\n  * Alex Channon as Temperance Miller\n  * Shaun Ward as Farmer\n  * Roderick Swift as Everdene farmer\n  * Don J.
