        "# _The Natural_\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThis article is about the 1952 novel. For the 1984 film based on the novel,\nsee [The Natural (film)](/wiki/The_Natural_\\(film\\) \"The Natural \\(film\\)\").\nFor other uses, see [The Natural\n(disambiguation)](/wiki/The_Natural_\\(disambiguation\\) \"The Natural\n\\(disambiguation\\)\").\n\nThe Natural\n[![TheNaturalFirstEdition.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c7/TheNaturalFirstEdition.jpg)](/wiki/File:TheNaturalFirstEdition.jpg)\nCover page of _The Natural_ (first edition)  \n---  \nAuthor | [Bernard Malamud](/wiki/Bernard_Malamud \"Bernard Malamud\")  \nCover artist | Simon Goltche  \nCountry | United States  \nLanguage | English  \nPublisher | [Harcourt Brace and Company](/wiki/Harcourt_Trade_Publishers \"Harcourt Trade Publishers\")  \nPublication date | 1952  \nMedia type | Print (hardback & paperback)  \n[OCLC](/wiki/OCLC#Identifiers_and_linked_data \"OCLC\") | [11868356](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11868356)  \nFollowed by | _[The Assistant](/wiki/The_Assistant_\\(novel\\) \"The Assistant \\(novel\\)\") (1957)_  \n  \n_**The Natural**_ is a 1952 novel about baseball by [Bernard\nMalamud](/wiki/Bernard_Malamud \"Bernard Malamud\"), and is his [debut\nnovel](/wiki/Debut_novel \"Debut novel\"). The story follows Roy Hobbs, a\nbaseball prodigy whose career is sidetracked when he is shot by a woman whose\nmotivation remains mysterious. Whether she is acting alone or is part of a\nplot can be debated. Most of the story concerns itself with his attempts to\nreturn to baseball later in life, when he plays for the fictional New York\nKnights with his legendary bat \"Wonderboy\".\n\nBased upon the bizarre shooting incident and subsequent comeback of\n[Philadelphia Phillies](/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\nplayer [Eddie Waitkus](/wiki/Eddie_Waitkus \"Eddie Waitkus\"),[1][2] the story\nof Roy Hobbs takes some poetic license and embellishes what was truly a\nstrange, but memorable, account of a career lost too soon. Apart from the fact\nthat both Waitkus and fictional Hobbs were shot by women, there are few if any\nother similarities. It has been alternately suggested that the shooting\nincident might have been inspired by [Chicago Cubs](/wiki/Chicago_Cubs\n\"Chicago Cubs\") shortstop [Billy Jurges](/wiki/Billy_Jurges \"Billy\nJurges\"),[3] who was shot by a showgirl with whom he was romantically linked,\nbut there has been no evidence to support this claim.\n\nA [film adaptation](/wiki/The_Natural_\\(film\\) \"The Natural \\(film\\)\") of _The\nNatural_ starring [Robert Redford](/wiki/Robert_Redford \"Robert Redford\") as\nRoy Hobbs was released in 1984.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Major themes\n  * 3 Major characters\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Plot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Natural&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Plot\")]\n\nNineteen-year-old Roy Hobbs is traveling by train to Chicago with his manager\nSam to try out for the [Chicago Cubs](/wiki/Chicago_Cubs \"Chicago Cubs\").\nOther passengers include sportswriter Max Mercy, Walter \"The Whammer\"\nWhambold, the leading hitter in the [American League](/wiki/American_League\n\"American League\") and three-time American League Most Valuable Player (based\non [Babe Ruth](/wiki/Babe_Ruth \"Babe Ruth\")), and Harriet Bird, a beautiful\nbut mysterious woman. The train makes a quick stop at a carnival along the\nrail where The Whammer challenges Hobbs to strike him out. Hobbs does just\nthat, much to everyone's surprise and The Whammer's humiliation. Back on the\ntrain Harriet Bird strikes up a conversation with Hobbs, who never suspects\nthat Bird has any ulterior motive. In fact, she is a lunatic obsessed with\nshooting the best baseball player. Her intended target was Whammer, but after\nHobbs struck him out, her attention shifts to Hobbs.\n\nIn Chicago, Hobbs checks into his hotel and promptly receives a call from\nBird, who is also staying there. When he goes down to her room, she shoots him\nin the stomach.\n\nThe novel picks up 15 years later in the dugout of the New York Knights, a\nfictional [National League](/wiki/National_League \"National League\") baseball\nteam. The team has been on an extended losing streak and manager Pop Fisher's\nand assistant manager Red Blow's careers appear to be winding to an\nignominious end. During one losing game, Roy Hobbs emerges from the clubhouse\ntunnel and announces that he is the team's new right fielder, having just been\nsigned by Knights co-owner Judge Banner. Both Pop and Red take Hobbs under\ntheir wing, and Red later tells Hobbs about Fisher's plight as manager of the\nKnights. The Judge wants to take over Pop's share in the team but cannot do\nthat until the current season ends and provided the Knights fail to win the\nNational League pennant.\n\nBeing the newest player, Roy has a number of practical jokes played upon him,\nincluding the theft of his \"Wonderboy\" bat. Once Roy gets his first chance at\nbat, however, he proves to be a true \"natural\" at the game. During one game,\nPop substitutes Hobbs as a pinch hitter for team star Bump Baily. Pop is\ndisappointed with Baily, who has not been hustling and decides to teach him a\nlesson by pinch-hitting for him. Pop tells Roy to \"knock the cover off of the\nball.\" Roy literally does that—hitting a triple to right field. A few days\nlater, a newly-hustling Bump attempts to play a hard hit fly ball. He runs\ninto the outfield wall, later dying from the impact. Roy permanently takes\nover Bump's position.\n\nMax Mercy reappears, searching for details of Hobbs' past. Hobbs remains quiet\neven after Mercy offers five thousand dollars, telling him that, \"all the\npublic is entitled to is my best game of baseball.\" At the same time, Hobbs\nhas been attempting to negotiate a higher salary with the judge, arguing that\nhis success should be rewarded. Mercy introduces Hobbs to bookie Gus Sands,\nwho is keeping company with Memo Paris, Pop's niece. Hobbs has been infatuated\nwith Memo since he came to the Knights. Hobbs' magic tricks appear to impress\nher.\n\nMax Mercy writes a column about the judge's refusal to grant Hobbs a raise,\nand a fan uprising ensues. Hobbs, however, is more occupied with Memo and\nattempts to further their relationship. Pop warns Hobbs about Memo's tendency\nto impart bad luck on the people she associates with. Hobbs dismisses the\nwarning, but soon after, he falls into a hitting slump. Numerous attempts to\nreverse it fail until he finally hits a home run during a game where a\nmysterious woman rises from her seat. Before Hobbs can see who she is, she has\nleft. Roy eventually meets her, Iris Lemon, and proceeds to court her. Upon\nlearning she is a grandmother, however, he loses interest and returns his\nattention to Memo Paris.\n\nMemo rebuffs Roy's advances; Hobbs continues to play brilliantly and leads the\nKnights to a 17-game winning streak. With the Knights one game away from\nwinning the National League pennant, Roy attends a party hosted by Memo where\nhe collapses and awakens in the hospital. The doctor says he can play in the\nfinal game of the season, but must retire after that if he wants to live.\nHobbs wants to start a family with Memo and realizes he will need money.\n\nThe judge offers Hobbs a bribe to lose the Knight's final game. Hobbs makes a\ncounter-offer of $35,000, which is accepted. That night, unable to sleep, he\nreads a letter from Iris. After seeing the word 'grandmother' in the letter,\nhe discards it. He plays the next day and while at-bat, fouls a pitch into the\nstands that strikes Iris, injuring her, and splits the Wonderboy bat in two\nlengthwise. Iris tells Roy that she is pregnant with his child, and now he is\ndetermined to do his best for their future. At the end of the game, with a\nchance to win it, Hobbs, now trying to win, comes to bat against Herman\nYoungberry, a brilliant young pitcher similar to Hobbs at the same age.\nYoungberry strikes out Hobbs, ending the game and the season for the Knights.\nAs he sits bemoaning the end of the season and possibly his career, Mercy\nrediscovers the shooting and also finds out that Hobbs was paid to throw the\ngame. If this report from Mercy is true, Roy Hobbs will be expelled from the\ngame and all of his records removed.\n\n## Major themes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Natural&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Major themes\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/20px-Ambox_important.svg.png) |  This section **possibly contains[original research](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research \"Wikipedia:No original research\")**. _(March 2013)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this template message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal \"Help:Maintenance template removal\"))_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe novel draws upon several sources of mythology, most notably the story of\nThe [Fisher King](/wiki/Fisher_King \"Fisher King\").[4][5] In the story's\nearliest versions, the knight [Percival](/wiki/Percival \"Percival\") does not\nask the king about the grail, so he fails to cure the\n[Wasteland](/wiki/Wasteland_\\(mythology\\) \"Wasteland \\(mythology\\)\"). Pop\nFisher is the manager of the Knights and his team is trying to win the\n[pennant](/wiki/Pennant_race#Postseason \"Pennant race\"), something he has\nnever achieved in his career as both a player and a manager. His name is an\nobvious reference, along with his need to be \"cured\" by Roy. Roy Hobbs is the\ngreat knight Percival who is meant to return the Holy Grail (pennant) to Pop\nFisher. In Malamud’s version, Hobbs does not win the pennant and the reader is\nled to believe that Pop Fisher will fade into obscurity.\n\nAlternatively, Roy Hobbs might represent a composite of the flawed hero [King\nArthur](/wiki/King_Arthur \"King Arthur\") and [Lancelot](/wiki/Lancelot\n\"Lancelot\"). Each is a heroic character whose lusts lead to his downfall. The\nname \"Roy Hobbs\" is derived from the Latin roots of \"King\" and \"horse,\"\nimplying the chivalric ideal, and the Wonderboy bat has the same invincible\nproperties of both Lancelot's strength and Arthur's sword Excalibur, both of\nwhich fail in the final crisis due to the characters' flaws.\n\nThe main difference between the film and the novel is the relationship between\nHobbs and Iris and the ending. In the film, Hobbs and Iris have known each\nother since childhood and had a romantic relationship before Hobbs left to\npursue baseball. Their brief romance resulted in an out-of-wedlock child whom\nHobbs never knew existed. At the end of the film, Hobbs hits a home run to win\nthe game and complete his heroic journey and is reunited with Iris and their\nson. In the novel, however, Hobbs has a [tragic flaw](/wiki/Tragic_flaw\n\"Tragic flaw\"); he has a weakness to succumb to his appetites, women, and\ncaring too much about his own glory. These tragic flaws result in the\ndestruction of his [Excalibur](/wiki/Excalibur \"Excalibur\") (Wonderboy), and\nends with him failing at his final time at bat. While the film shows Hobbs\nvictorious and fulfilling his dreams of glory, the novel shows a Hobbs who is\ncrushed by his own hubris and must now live as a forgotten man.\n\n## Major\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Natural&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Major characters\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Bernard_Malamud_The_Natural_signed_copy.jpg/220px-\nBernard_Malamud_The_Natural_signed_copy.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bernard_Malamud_The_Natural_signed_copy.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bernard_Malamud_The_Natural_signed_copy.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA signed first edition copy of _The Natural_ held by [Oregon State\nUniversity](/wiki/Oregon_State_University \"Oregon State University\"), who\nemployed Malamud.[6]\n\n  * Roy Hobbs – “The Natural” – A former teenage pitching phenomenon whose career was sidelined and dreams were derailed when he was seriously injured after a meeting with a mysterious woman who shoots him as he travels to Chicago to try out for a Major League baseball team. The story revolves around Hobbs's quest to make a comeback years after the tragedy and, hopefully, finally to take his rightful place on the field and be remembered as one of the greatest ballplayers of all time.[7]\n  * Memo Paris – Roy’s main love interest throughout the story, Memo is Pop Fisher’s niece and is often in the company of Sands. She is generally unhappy and leads Roy on for most of the novel.\n  * Pop Fisher – The grizzled manager of the New York Knights, Pop was once a fine player who is remembered for making a crucial error in his playing career and for never winning the big game. His name and situation are suggestive of the [Fisher King](/wiki/Fisher_King \"Fisher King\") of legend.\n  * Max Mercy – A seedy journalist who is more concerned with unearthing facts about the player’s personal lives than covering the sport itself. Mercy meets Hobbs in the beginning of the novel and later spends most of his time trying to uncover his dark secrets.\n  * Sands – A [morally bankrupt](/wiki/Morally_bankrupt \"Morally bankrupt\") bookie who enjoys placing bets against Hobbs until he persuades him to take a dive in the final game. He is also always around Memo, despite Roy’s protests.\n  * Iris Lemon – A fan of Roy’s who helps him break his slump in the middle of the season. Iris makes a deep connection with Roy, although he favors Memo over her until the end of the novel.\n  * Harriet Bird – The mysterious woman the teen-aged Roy meets on the train when he is en route to Chicago at the beginning of the novel. She later shoots him in her hotel room before committing suicide. Her character is loosely based on [Ruth Ann Steinhagen](/wiki/Ruth_Ann_Steinhagen \"Ruth Ann Steinhagen\"), a disturbed 19-year-old baseball fan who, obsessed with [Eddie Waitkus](/wiki/Eddie_Waitkus \"Eddie Waitkus\"), shot and nearly killed him in 1949.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Natural&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Lalli (June 14, 2011).
