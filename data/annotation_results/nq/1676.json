An oval interior space was a\n[Baroque](/wiki/Baroque \"Baroque\") concept that was adapted by\n[Neoclassicism](/wiki/Neoclassicism \"Neoclassicism\"). Oval rooms became\npopular in eighteenth century neoclassical architecture.\n\nIn November 1800, [John Adams](/wiki/John_Adams \"John Adams\") became the first\nPresident to occupy the White House. He and his successor, President [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\"), used Hoban's oval rooms\nin the same ceremonial manner that Washington had used the Bow Window,\nstanding before the three windows at the south end to receive guests.[10]\n\nDuring the 19th century, a number of presidents used the White House's second-\nfloor [Yellow Oval Room](/wiki/Yellow_Oval_Room_\\(White_House\\) \"Yellow Oval\nRoom \\(White House\\)\") as a private office or library.\n\n### West Wing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oval_Office&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: West Wing\")]\n\nThe [West Wing](/wiki/West_Wing \"West Wing\") was the idea of President\n[Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\"), brought\nabout by his wife's opinion that the second floor of the White House, then\nshared between bedrooms and offices, should be just a domestic space. The one-\nstory Executive Office Building was intended to be a temporary structure, for\nuse until a permanent building was erected either on that site or\nelsewhere.[11] Building it to the west of the White House allowed the removal\nof a vast, dilapidated set of pre-[Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War\n\"American Civil War\") greenhouses that had been constructed by President\n[James Buchanan](/wiki/James_Buchanan \"James Buchanan\").[12] Roosevelt moved\nthe offices of the [executive branch](/wiki/Executive_branch \"Executive\nbranch\") to the newly constructed wing in 1902. His workspace was a two-room\nsuite of Executive Office and Cabinet Room, located just west of the present\n[Cabinet Room](/wiki/Cabinet_Room_\\(White_House\\) \"Cabinet Room \\(White\nHouse\\)\"). The furniture, including the [president's\ndesk](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_desk \"Theodore Roosevelt desk\"), was designed\nby architect [Charles Follen McKim](/wiki/Charles_Follen_McKim \"Charles Follen\nMcKim\") and executed by [A.

Nearly identical in size to the modern\noffice, it was damaged by fire in 1929 and demolished in 1933.\n\nPresident [William Howard Taft](/wiki/William_Howard_Taft \"William Howard\nTaft\") made the West Wing a permanent building, expanding it southward,\ndoubling its size, and building the first Oval Office.[14] Designed by [Nathan\nC. Wyeth](/wiki/Nathan_C._Wyeth \"Nathan C. Wyeth\") and completed in 1909, the\noffice was centered on the south side of the building, much as the oval rooms\nin the White House are. Taft intended it to be the hub of his administration,\nand, by locating it in the center of the West Wing, he could be more involved\nwith the day-to-day operation of his presidency. The Taft Oval Office had\nsimple Georgian Revival trim, and was likely the most colorful in history; the\nwalls were covered with vibrant seagrass green burlap.[15]\n\nOn December 24, 1929, during President [Herbert Hoover](/wiki/Herbert_Hoover\n\"Herbert Hoover\")'s administration, a fire severely damaged the West Wing.\nHoover used this as an opportunity to create more space, excavating a partial\nbasement for additional offices. He restored the Oval Office, upgrading the\nquality of trim and installing air-conditioning. He also replaced the\nfurniture, which had undergone no major changes in twenty years.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/West_Wing_between_1910_and_1920_cropped.jpg/120px-West_Wing_between_1910_and_1920_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:West_Wing_between_1910_and_1920_cropped.jpg)\n\nExterior of the West Wing (circa 1910s), showing the curve of the Taft Oval\nOffice.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/President_Hoover_views_West_Wing_fire_ruins_15_January_1930_cropped.jpg/120px-President_Hoover_views_West_Wing_fire_ruins_15_January_1930_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:President_Hoover_views_West_Wing_fire_ruins_15_January_1930_cropped.jpg)\n\nPresident Hoover views West Wing fire ruins, January 15, 1930.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/West-wing-1934-construction.jpg/120px-West-wing-1934-construction.jpg)](/wiki/File:West-wing-1934-construction.jpg)\n\nWest Wing construction, 1934.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Oval_Office_Exterior.jpg/120px-Oval_Office_Exterior.jpg)](/wiki/File:Oval_Office_Exterior.jpg)\n\nExterior of the Oval Office as viewed from the South Lawn, July 15, 2006.\n\n## Modern Oval Office:\n1934–present[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oval_Office&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Modern Oval Office: 1934–present\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/White_House_West_Wing_-_1st_Floor_with_the_Oval_Office_highlighted.png/230px-\nWhite_House_West_Wing_-_1st_Floor_with_the_Oval_Office_highlighted.png)](/wiki/File:White_House_West_Wing_-_1st_Floor_with_the_Oval_Office_highlighted.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:White_House_West_Wing_-_1st_Floor_with_the_Oval_Office_highlighted.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nLocation of the Oval Office in the [West Wing](/wiki/West_Wing \"West Wing\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/FDR_Oval_Office_in_1934_LOC37952v_cropped.jpg/230px-\nFDR_Oval_Office_in_1934_LOC37952v_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:FDR_Oval_Office_in_1934_LOC37952v_cropped.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FDR_Oval_Office_in_1934_LOC37952v_cropped.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe newly built FDR Oval Office in 1934.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/OvalMedallion.jpg/230px-\nOvalMedallion.jpg)](/wiki/File:OvalMedallion.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:OvalMedallion.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPlaster ceiling medallion installed in 1934 includes elements of the [Seal of\nthe President of the United\nStates](/wiki/Seal_of_the_President_of_the_United_States \"Seal of the\nPresident of the United States\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/REAGANEugeniaCharles.jpg/220px-\nREAGANEugeniaCharles.jpg)](/wiki/File:REAGANEugeniaCharles.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:REAGANEugeniaCharles.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\") discussing Grenada with\nPrime Minister [Eugenia Charles](/wiki/Eugenia_Charles \"Eugenia Charles\") of\n[Dominica](/wiki/Dominica \"Dominica\") in the Oval Office\n\nDissatisfied with the size and layout of the West Wing, President [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\") engaged New\nYork architect [Eric Gugler](/wiki/Eric_Gugler \"Eric Gugler\") to redesign it\nin 1933. To create additional space without increasing the apparent size of\nthe building, Gugler excavated a full basement, added a set of subterranean\noffices under the adjacent lawn, and built an unobtrusive \"penthouse\" story.\nThe directive to wring the most office space out of the existing building was\nresponsible for its narrow corridors and cramped staff offices. Gugler's most\nvisible addition was the expansion of the building eastward for a new Cabinet\nRoom and Oval Office.[16]\n\nThe modern Oval Office was built at the West Wing's southeast corner, offering\nFDR, who was physically disabled and used a [wheelchair](/wiki/Wheelchair\n\"Wheelchair\"), more privacy and easier access to the Residence. He and Gugler\ndevised a room architecturally grander than the previous two rooms, with more\nrobust Georgian details: doors topped with substantial pediments, bookcases\nset into niches, a deep bracketed cornice, and a ceiling medallion of the\n[Presidential Seal](/wiki/Seal_of_the_President_of_the_United_States \"Seal of\nthe President of the United States\"). Rather than a chandelier or ceiling\nfixture, the room is illuminated by light bulbs hidden within the cornice that\n\"wash\" the ceiling in light.[17] In small ways, hints of [Art\nModerne](/wiki/Art_Moderne \"Art Moderne\") can be seen, in the sconces flanking\nthe windows and the representation of the eagle in the ceiling medallion. FDR\nand Gugler worked closely together, often over breakfast, with Gugler\nsketching the president's ideas. One notion resulting from these sketches that\nhas become fixed in the layout of the room's furniture, is that of two high\nback chairs in front of the fireplace. The public sees this most often with\nthe president seated on the left, and a visiting head of state on the right.\nThis allowed FDR to be seated, with his guests at the same level, de-\nemphasizing his inability to stand. Construction of the modern Oval Office was\ncompleted in 1934.\n\n### Decoration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oval_Office&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Decoration\")]\n\nThe basic Oval Office furnishings have been a desk in front of the three\nwindows at the south end, a pair of chairs in front of the fireplace at the\nnorth end, a pair of sofas, and assorted tables and chairs. The\n[Neoclassical](/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture \"Neoclassical architecture\")\nmantel was made for the Taft Oval Office in 1909, and salvaged after the 1929\nWest Wing fire.[18] A tradition of displaying potted Swedish ivy\n(_[Plectranthus verticillatus](/wiki/Plectranthus_verticillatus \"Plectranthus\nverticillatus\")_) atop the [mantel](/wiki/Fireplace_mantel \"Fireplace mantel\")\ngoes back to the administration of [John F. Kennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy\n\"John F. Kennedy\"), and the current plants were rooted from the original\nplant.\n\nA [Federal](/wiki/Federal_furniture \"Federal furniture\") longcase clock, made\nin Boston by John and Thomas Seymour c. 1795–1805 – commonly known as the\n[Oval Office grandfather clock](/wiki/Oval_Office_grandfather_clock \"Oval\nOffice grandfather clock\") – was purchased by the White House Historical\nAssociation in 1972, and has stood next to the Oval Office's northeast door\nsince 1975.[19]\n\nThe carpet of the Oval Office bears the [Seal of the\nPresident](/wiki/Seal_of_the_President_of_the_United_States \"Seal of the\nPresident of the United States\"). President [Harry S.\nTruman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S. Truman\")'s oval carpet was the first\nto incorporate the presidential seal. In Truman's carpet, the seal was\nrepresented monochromatically through varying depths of the cut pile. His\ncarpet was used in the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. In recent years\nmost administrations have created their own rug, working with an interior\ndesigner and the [Curator of the White\nHouse](/wiki/White_House_Office_of_the_Curator \"White House Office of the\nCurator\"). As part of her overall restoration of the White House, Jacqueline\nKennedy had a redecoration of the Oval Office begun on November 21, 1963, when\nshe accompanied President John F. Kennedy on a trip to Texas. The next day,\nNovember 22, a new carpet was installed just as the Kennedys were making their\nway through Dallas and the President was assassinated.[20]\n\n#### Desks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oval_Office&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Desks\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Caroline_Kennedy_Kerry_Kennedy_Resolute_Desk_a.jpg/220px-\nCaroline_Kennedy_Kerry_Kennedy_Resolute_Desk_a.jpg)](/wiki/File:Caroline_Kennedy_Kerry_Kennedy_Resolute_Desk_a.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Caroline_Kennedy_Kerry_Kennedy_Resolute_Desk_a.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Caroline Kennedy](/wiki/Caroline_Kennedy \"Caroline Kennedy\") and [Kerry\nKennedy](/wiki/Kerry_Kennedy \"Kerry Kennedy\") beneath the [_Resolute_\ndesk](/wiki/Resolute_desk \"Resolute desk\") in 1963\n\n[Six desks](/wiki/List_of_Oval_Office_desks \"List of Oval Office desks\") have\nbeen used in the Oval Office by U.S. Presidents.

The ship had\nbeen frozen in [Arctic](/wiki/Arctic \"Arctic\") ice and abandoned but was later\nfound and freed by American seamen. It was refurbished and presented as a gift\nfrom the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") to [Queen\nVictoria](/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Victoria of the United\nKingdom\") in 1856. When the ship was decommissioned from the [British\nNavy](/wiki/British_Navy \"British Navy\") in 1879, Queen Victoria ordered twin\ndesks made from its timbers, keeping one and presenting the other as a gift to\nPresident [Rutherford B.

A portrait of Abraham Lincoln by\nGeorge Henry Story hung in George W. Bush's office, and continued in Barack\nObama's. Three landscapes/cityscapes by minor artists – _[City of Washington\nfrom Beyond the Navy Yard](/wiki/City_of_Washington_from_Beyond_the_Navy_Yard\n\"City of Washington from Beyond the Navy Yard\")_ by [George\nCooke](/wiki/George_Cooke_\\(painter\\) \"George Cooke \\(painter\\)\"), _Eastport\nand Passamaquoddy Bay_ by Victor de Grailly, and _The President 's House_, a\ncopy after [William Henry Bartlett](/wiki/William_Henry_Bartlett \"William\nHenry Bartlett\") – have adorned the walls in multiple administrations. _[The\nAvenue in the Rain](/wiki/The_Avenue_in_the_Rain \"The Avenue in the Rain\")_ by\n[Childe Hassam](/wiki/Childe_Hassam \"Childe Hassam\") and _[Working on the\nStatue of Liberty](/wiki/Working_on_the_Statue_of_Liberty \"Working on the\nStatue of Liberty\")_ by [Norman Rockwell](/wiki/Norman_Rockwell \"Norman\nRockwell\") flanked the _Resolute_ Desk in Bill Clinton's office, and did the\nsame in Barack Obama's.\n\nStatuettes, busts, heads, and figurines are frequently displayed in the Oval\nOffice. Abraham Lincoln has been the most common subject, in works by\nsculptors [Augustus Saint-Gaudens](/wiki/Augustus_Saint-Gaudens \"Augustus\nSaint-Gaudens\"), [Gutzon Borglum](/wiki/Gutzon_Borglum \"Gutzon Borglum\"),\n[Adolph Alexander Weinman](/wiki/Adolph_Alexander_Weinman \"Adolph Alexander\nWeinman\"), [Leo Cherne](/wiki/Leo_Cherne \"Leo Cherne\") and others. In recent\nadministrations, traditional busts of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson or\nBenjamin Franklin have given way to heads of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S.\nTruman or Dwight Eisenhower. Western bronzes by [Frederic\nRemington](/wiki/Frederic_Remington \"Frederic Remington\") have been frequent\nchoices: Harry S. Truman displayed _Fired On_ ; Lyndon Johnson displayed _[The\nBronco Buster](/wiki/Bronco_Buster \"Bronco Buster\")_ , as did Gerald Ford,\nJimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\nPresidents Reagan and Bush added its companion piece, _Rattlesnake_.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman displayed works related to his home state of\n[Missouri](/wiki/Missouri \"Missouri\"), illustrations of\n[biplanes](/wiki/Biplanes \"Biplanes\"), and models of jet-airplanes. He hung a\nlarge photograph of the White House portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, under\nwhom he had served as Vice-President, who died in office in 1945. President\nDwight Eisenhower filled the office walls with landscape paintings, as well as\na painting of [Robert E. Lee](/wiki/Robert_E._Lee \"Robert E. Lee\").[21]\nPresident John F. Kennedy surrounded himself with paintings of naval battles\nfrom the [War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\"), photographs of\nsailboats, and ship models. President Lyndon Johnson installed sconces on\neither side of the mantel, and added the office's first painting by a woman\nartist, _Franklin D. Roosevelt_ by [Elizabeth\nShoumatoff](/wiki/Elizabeth_Shoumatoff \"Elizabeth Shoumatoff\"). President\nRichard Nixon tried three different George Washington portraits over the\nmantel, and hung a copy of _[Earthrise](/wiki/Earthrise \"Earthrise\")_ – a\nphotograph of the earth taken from the moon's orbit during the [Apollo\n8](/wiki/Apollo_8 \"Apollo 8\") mission – beside his desk. President Gerald Ford\ndisplayed tasteful, conservative works; paintings that remained mostly in\nplace through the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. President\nGeorge H. W. Bush added [luminist](/wiki/Luminism_\\(American_art_style\\)\n\"Luminism \\(American art style\\)\") landscapes. President Bill Clinton chose\nthe Childe Hassam and Norman Rockwell paintings mentioned above, along with\n_Waiting for the Hour_ by William T. Carlton,[22] a genre painting showing\nAfrican-Americans gathered in anticipation of the [Emancipation\nProclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation Proclamation\")\ngoing into effect. President George W. Bush mixed traditional works with\npaintings by Texas artists and Western sculptures. Following the September 11,\n2001 attacks, British [Prime Minister Tony Blair](/wiki/Tony_Blair \"Tony\nBlair\") lent him a [bust of Winston\nChurchill](/wiki/Bust_of_Winston_Churchill_\\(Epstein\\) \"Bust of Winston\nChurchill \\(Epstein\\)\"), who had guided Great Britain through World War II.\nPresident Barack Obama honored Abraham Lincoln with the portrait by Story, a\nbust by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation.\nBelow the proclamation was a [bust of Martin Luther King\nJr.](/wiki/Bust_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr._\\(Alston\\) \"Bust of Martin Luther\nKing Jr. \\(Alston\\)\") by [Charles Alston](/wiki/Charles_Alston \"Charles\nAlston\"),[23] and in the nearby bookcase was a program from the [August 28,\n1963 March on Washington](/wiki/March_on_Washington \"March on Washington\"), at\nwhich Dr. King gave his \"[I Have a Dream Speech](/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream_Speech\n\"I Have a Dream Speech\").\"\n\n### Redecoration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oval_Office&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Redecoration\")]\n\nA tradition evolved in the latter part of the twentieth century of each new\nadministration redecorating the office to the President's liking. A new\nadministration usually selects an oval [carpet](/wiki/Carpet \"Carpet\"), new\n[drapery](/wiki/Drapery \"Drapery\"), the paintings on the walls, and some\nfurniture. Most incoming presidents continue using the rug of their\npredecessor until their new one is installed. The retired carpet very often is\nthen moved to the presidential library of the president for whom it was made.\n\nThe redecoration of the Oval Office is usually coordinated by the [First\nLady's](/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States \"First Lady of the United\nStates\") office in the [East Wing](/wiki/East_Wing \"East Wing\"), working with\nan interior designer and the [White House Curator](/wiki/White_House_Curator\n\"White House Curator\").\n\n### Alterations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oval_Office&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Alterations\")]\n\nSince the present Oval Office's construction in 1934 during the administration\nof President [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt\n\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt\") the room has remained mostly unchanged\narchitecturally.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] More than any president, FDR left an impression\non the room and its use. Doors and window frames have been modified\nslightly.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] A screen door on the east wall was removed\nafter the installation of air conditioning. President [Lyndon B.\nJohnson](/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson \"Lyndon B. Johnson\")'s row of wire service\nTeletype machines on the southeast wall required cutting plaster and flooring\nto accommodate wiring.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The Georgian style plaster ornament has been\ncleaned to remove accumulated paint, and a series of electrified wall\n[sconces](/wiki/Sconce_\\(light_fixture\\) \"Sconce \\(light fixture\\)\") have come\nand gone.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThough some presidents have chosen to do day-to-day work in a smaller study\njust west of the Oval Office, most use the actual Oval Office for work and\nmeetings. Traffic from the large numbers of staff, visitors, and pets over\ntime takes its toll. There have been four sets of flooring in the Oval Office.\nThe original floor was made of [cork](/wiki/Cork_\\(material\\) \"Cork\n\\(material\\)\") installed over soft wood; however, President [Dwight D.\nEisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\") was an avid\n[golfer](/wiki/Golf \"Golf\") and damaged the floor with his golf spikes.\nJohnson had the floor replaced in the mid-1960s with wood-grain\n[linoleum](/wiki/Linoleum \"Linoleum\"). In 1982, President [Ronald\nReagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\") had the floor replaced with\nquarter sawn oak and walnut, in a cross parquet pattern similar in design to\nEric Gugler's 1933 sketch, which had never been installed. In August 2005, the\nfloor was replaced again under President [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush\n\"George W. Bush\"), in exactly the same pattern as the Reagan floor.\n\n### Conservation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oval_Office&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Conservation\")]\n\nIn the late 1980s, a comprehensive assessment of the entire house, including\nthe Oval Office, was made as part of the [National Park\nService](/wiki/National_Park_Service \"National Park Service\")'s [Historic\nAmerican Buildings Survey](/wiki/Historic_American_Buildings_Survey \"Historic\nAmerican Buildings Survey\") (HABS).[24] Detailed photographs and measured\ndrawings were made documenting the interior and exterior and showing even\nslight imperfections.
