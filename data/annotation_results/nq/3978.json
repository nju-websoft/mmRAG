[British Army](/wiki/British_Army \"British Army\") Major\nDuncan Heyward arrives in Albany. He has been sent to serve under Colonel\nEdmund Munro, the commander of [Fort William Henry](/wiki/Fort_William_Henry\n\"Fort William Henry\"). Heyward is given the task of escorting the colonel’s\ntwo daughters, Cora and Alice, to their father. He is a family friend and in\nlove with Cora, to whom he proposes before they leave, but she does not give\nhim an answer.\n\nMajor Heyward, the two women, and a troop of British soldiers march through\nthe rugged countryside, guided by [Magua](/wiki/Magua \"Magua\"), a\n[Huron](/wiki/Wyandot_people \"Wyandot people\") warrior. Magua leads the party\ninto an ambush. All of the soldiers are killed or wounded, but Heyward and the\nwomen are rescued by the timely intervention of the [Mohican](/wiki/Mohican\n\"Mohican\") chief [Chingachgook](/wiki/Chingachgook \"Chingachgook\"), his son\n[Uncas](/wiki/Uncas \"Uncas\"), and his white, adopted son\n\"[Hawkeye](/wiki/Natty_Bumppo \"Natty Bumppo\")\", who kill all of the ambushers\nexcept Magua, who escapes. The rescuers agree to take the women and Heyward to\nthe fort. During the fight, Hawkeye noticed that Magua attempted to kill Cora\nand asks Duncan if he knows why. During the trek, Cora and Hawkeye are\nattracted to each other, as are Uncas and Alice.\n\nWhen the party nears the fort, they find it under siege by the French and\ntheir Huron allies. The party manages to sneak in and are greeted by Colonel\nMunro, who asks Major Heyward about the requested, desperately needed\nreinforcements. While there, Cora and Hawkeye share a passionate kiss, and\nHeyward becomes jealous. In response, Cora finally tells him she will not\nmarry him.\n\nWhen Munro refuses to allow the militiamen to sneak away to defend their own\nfamilies and homes, as he had earlier promised, Hawkeye arranges it anyway. He\nstays, however, and is condemned to death. Before that happens, during a\nparlay, French general [Louis-Joseph de Montcalm](/wiki/Louis-\nJoseph_de_Montcalm \"Louis-Joseph de Montcalm\") shows Munro an intercepted\nmessage which states that no reinforcements have been sent. Montcalm offers to\nallow the British to evacuate the fort with honor, keeping their weapons.\nMunro has little choice but to accept. However, Magua, a French ally, is\nfurious at this arrangement. He harbors great hatred for Munro, blaming him\nfor past wrongs done to him and his family.\n\nThe following day, Colonel Munro, his soldiers, and their women and children\nleave the fort. Magua and his Huron warriors ambush them. Magua personally\nkills Munro. Hawkeye and the Mohicans fight their way out, leading Cora,\nAlice, and Heyward to temporary safety. Later, however, Magua captures the\nmajor and the women. Magua takes his prisoners to a Huron settlement and\naddresses its [sachem](/wiki/Sachem \"Sachem\"). He is interrupted by Hawkeye,\nwho comes in alone to plead for their lives.\n\nThe sachem rules that Heyward be returned to the British, Alice given to\nMagua, and Cora [burned alive](/wiki/Execution_by_burning \"Execution by\nburning\"). Hawkeye, for his great bravery, may leave unharmed. Hawkeye tells\nHeyward, who is serving as translator, to beg the sachem to let Hawkeye take\nCora's place. Instead, Heyward trades his own life for Cora’s.\n\nOnce Cora and Hawkeye are far enough away, Hawkeye shoots Heyward to end his\nsuffering. Chingachgook, Uncas, and Hawkeye then set out after Magua's party\nto free Alice. Uncas races ahead and engages Magua in personal combat, but is\nkilled. Alice chooses to step off the cliff to her death rather than go to the\nbeckoning Magua. While Hawkeye holds Magua's remaining men at bay,\nChingachgook duels Magua and avenges his son. Chingachgook prays to the [Great\nSpirit](/wiki/Great_Spirit \"Great Spirit\") to receive Uncas, calling himself\n\"the last of the Mohicans\".\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Last_of_the_Mohicans_\\(1992_film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Daniel Day-Lewis](/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis \"Daniel Day-Lewis\") as Hawkeye/Nathaniel Poe\n  * [Madeleine Stowe](/wiki/Madeleine_Stowe \"Madeleine Stowe\") as Cora Munro\n  * [Russell Means](/wiki/Russell_Means \"Russell Means\") as [Chingachgook](/wiki/Chingachgook \"Chingachgook\")\n  * [Eric Schweig](/wiki/Eric_Schweig \"Eric Schweig\") as [Uncas](/wiki/Uncas \"Uncas\")\n  * [Jodhi May](/wiki/Jodhi_May \"Jodhi May\") as Alice Munro\n  * [Steven Waddington](/wiki/Steven_Waddington \"Steven Waddington\") as Maj.
