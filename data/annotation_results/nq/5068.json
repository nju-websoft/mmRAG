In the [human\nbody](/wiki/Human_body \"Human body\") there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, one\non each side of the [vertebral column](/wiki/Vertebral_column \"Vertebral\ncolumn\").

The dorsal root is the\n[afferent](/wiki/Afferent_nerve_fiber \"Afferent nerve fiber\") sensory root and\ncarries sensory information to the brain. The ventral root is the\n[efferent](/wiki/Efferent_nerve_fiber \"Efferent nerve fiber\") motor root and\ncarries motor information from the brain. The spinal nerve emerges from the\nspinal column through an opening ([intervertebral\nforamen](/wiki/Intervertebral_foramen \"Intervertebral foramen\")) between\nadjacent vertebrae. This is true for all spinal nerves except for the first\nspinal nerve pair (C1), which emerges between the [occipital\nbone](/wiki/Occipital_bone \"Occipital bone\") and the\n[atlas](/wiki/Atlas_\\(anatomy\\) \"Atlas \\(anatomy\\)\") (the first vertebra).\nThus the cervical nerves are numbered by the vertebra below, except spinal\nnerve C8, which exists below vertebra C7 and above vertebra T1. The thoracic,\nlumbar, and sacral nerves are then numbered by the vertebra above. In the case\nof a [lumbarized](/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae#Variation \"Lumbar vertebrae\") S1\nvertebra (aka L6) or a [sacralized](/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae#Variation \"Lumbar\nvertebrae\") L5 vertebra, the nerves are typically still counted to L5 and the\nnext nerve is S1.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Gray799.svg/300px-\nGray799.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Gray799.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gray799.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nScheme showing structure of a typical spinal nerve  \n1\\.

[Sympathetic afferent](/wiki/General_visceral_afferent_fibers \"General\nvisceral afferent fibers\")\n\nOutside the vertebral column, the nerve divides into branches. The [dorsal\nramus](/wiki/Dorsal_ramus_of_spinal_nerve \"Dorsal ramus of spinal nerve\")\ncontains nerves that serve the posterior portions of the trunk carrying\nvisceral motor, somatic motor, and somatic sensory information to and from the\nskin and muscles of the back ([epaxial muscles](/wiki/Epaxial_muscles \"Epaxial\nmuscles\")). The [ventral ramus](/wiki/Ventral_ramus \"Ventral ramus\") contains\nnerves that serve the remaining anterior parts of the trunk and the upper and\nlower limbs ([hypaxial muscles](/wiki/Hypaxial_muscles \"Hypaxial muscles\"))\ncarrying visceral motor, somatic motor, and sensory information to and from\nthe ventrolateral body surface, structures in the body wall, and the limbs.\nThe [meningeal branches (recurrent meningeal or sinuvertebral\nnerves)](/wiki/Meningeal_branches_of_spinal_nerve \"Meningeal branches of\nspinal nerve\") branch from the spinal nerve and re-enter the intervertebral\nforamen to serve the ligaments, dura, blood vessels, intervertebral discs,\nfacet joints, and periosteum of the vertebrae. The [rami\ncommunicantes](/wiki/Rami_communicantes \"Rami communicantes\") contain\nautonomic nerves that serve visceral functions carrying visceral motor and\nsensory information to and from the visceral organs.\n\nSome anterior rami merge with adjacent anterior rami to form a [nerve\nplexus](/wiki/Nerve_plexus \"Nerve plexus\"), a network of interconnecting\nnerves. Nerves emerging from a plexus contain fibers from various spinal\nnerves, which are now carried together to some target location. Major plexuses\ninclude the [cervical](/wiki/Cervical_plexus \"Cervical plexus\"),\n[brachial](/wiki/Brachial_plexus \"Brachial plexus\"),\n[lumbar](/wiki/Lumbar_plexus \"Lumbar plexus\"), and\n[sacral](/wiki/Sacral_plexus \"Sacral plexus\") plexuses.\n\n## Regional\nnerves[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spinal_nerve&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Regional nerves\")]\n\nFurther information: [Spinal cord § Spinal cord\nsegments](/wiki/Spinal_cord#Spinal_cord_segments \"Spinal cord\")\n\n### Cervical\nnerves[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spinal_nerve&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Cervical nerves\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Gray795.png/220px-\nGray795.png)](/wiki/File:Gray795.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gray795.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nCervical nerves\n\nThe cervical nerves are the spinal nerves from the cervical vertebrae in the\n[cervical segment](/wiki/Spinal_cord#Spinal_cord_segments \"Spinal cord\") of\nthe spinal cord. Although there are seven cervical vertebrae (C1-C7), there\nare eight cervical nerves [C1](/wiki/Cervical_spinal_nerve_1 \"Cervical spinal\nnerve 1\")–[C8](/wiki/Cervical_spinal_nerve_8 \"Cervical spinal nerve 8\"). All\ncervical nerves except C8 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while\nthe C8 nerve emerges below the C7 vertebra. Elsewhere in the spine, the nerve\nemerges below the vertebra with the same name.\n\nThe posterior distribution includes the [suboccipital\nnerve](/wiki/Suboccipital_nerve \"Suboccipital nerve\") (C1), the [greater\noccipital nerve](/wiki/Greater_occipital_nerve \"Greater occipital nerve\") (C2)\nand the [third occipital nerve](/wiki/Third_occipital_nerve \"Third occipital\nnerve\") (C3). The anterior distribution includes the [cervical\nplexus](/wiki/Cervical_plexus \"Cervical plexus\") (C1-C4) and [brachial\nplexus](/wiki/Brachial_plexus \"Brachial plexus\") (C5-T1).\n\nThe cervical nerves innervate the [sternohyoid](/wiki/Sternohyoid_muscle\n\"Sternohyoid muscle\"), [sternothyroid](/wiki/Sternothyroid_muscle\n\"Sternothyroid muscle\") and [omohyoid muscles](/wiki/Omohyoid_muscle \"Omohyoid\nmuscle\").\n\nA loop of nerves called [ansa cervicalis](/wiki/Ansa_cervicalis \"Ansa\ncervicalis\") is part of the cervical plexus.\n\n### Thoracic\nnerves[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spinal_nerve&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Thoracic nerves\")]\n\nThe thoracic nerves are the twelve spinal nerves emerging from the thoracic\nvertebrae. Each thoracic nerve T1 -T12 originates from below each\ncorresponding [thoracic vertebra](/wiki/Thoracic_vertebra \"Thoracic\nvertebra\"). Branches also exit the spine and go directly to the [paravertebral\nganglia](/wiki/Paravertebral_ganglia \"Paravertebral ganglia\") of the\n[autonomic nervous system](/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system \"Autonomic nervous\nsystem\") where they are involved in the functions of organs and glands in the\nhead, neck, thorax and abdomen.\n\nAnterior divisions: The [intercostal nerves](/wiki/Intercostal_nerves\n\"Intercostal nerves\") come from thoracic nerves T1-T11, and run between the\nribs. At T2 and T3, further branches form the [intercostobrachial\nnerve](/wiki/Intercostobrachial_nerve \"Intercostobrachial nerve\"). The\n[subcostal nerve](/wiki/Subcostal_nerve \"Subcostal nerve\") comes from nerve\nT12, and runs below the twelfth rib.\n\nPosterior divisions: The medial branches (ramus medialis) of the posterior\nbranches of the upper six thoracic nerves run between the [semispinalis\ndorsi](/wiki/Semispinalis_dorsi \"Semispinalis dorsi\") and\n[multifidus](/wiki/Multifidus \"Multifidus\"), which they supply; they then\npierce the [rhomboid](/wiki/Rhomboid_muscle \"Rhomboid muscle\") and [trapezius\nmuscles](/wiki/Trapezius_muscle \"Trapezius muscle\"), and reach the skin by the\nsides of the spinous processes. This sensitive branch is called the medial\ncutaneous ramus.\n\nThe medial branches of the lower six are distributed chiefly to the multifidus\nand [longissimus dorsi](/wiki/Longissimus_dorsi \"Longissimus dorsi\"),\noccasionally they give off filaments to the skin near the middle line. This\nsensitive branch is called the posterior cutaneous ramus.\n\n### Lumbar nerves[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spinal_nerve&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Lumbar nerves\")]\n\nFurther information: [List of lumbar nerves](/wiki/List_of_lumbar_nerves \"List\nof lumbar nerves\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Gray823.png/220px-\nGray823.png)](/wiki/File:Gray823.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gray823.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nLumbar plexus and branches\n\nThe lumbar nerves are the five spinal nerves emerging from the lumbar\nvertebrae. They are divided into posterior and anterior divisions.\n\n**Posterior divisions** : The medial branches of the posterior divisions of\nthe lumbar nerves run close to the articular processes of the vertebrae and\nend in the [multifidus muscle](/wiki/Multifidus_muscle \"Multifidus muscle\").\n\nThe laterals supply the [erector spinae muscles](/wiki/Erector_spinae_muscles\n\"Erector spinae muscles\").\n\nThe upper three give off cutaneous nerves which pierce the aponeurosis of the\n[latissimus dorsi](/wiki/Latissimus_dorsi \"Latissimus dorsi\") at the lateral\nborder of the erector spinae muscles, and descend across the posterior part of\nthe [iliac crest](/wiki/Iliac_crest \"Iliac crest\") to the skin of the\n[buttock](/wiki/Buttock \"Buttock\"), some of their twigs running as far as the\nlevel of the [greater trochanter](/wiki/Greater_trochanter \"Greater\ntrochanter\").\n\n**Anterior divisions** : The anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves (rami\nanteriores) increase in size from above downward. They are joined, near their\norigins, by [gray rami communicantes](/wiki/Gray_rami_communicantes \"Gray rami\ncommunicantes\") from the [lumbar ganglia](/wiki/Lumbar_ganglia \"Lumbar\nganglia\") of the [sympathetic trunk](/wiki/Sympathetic_trunk \"Sympathetic\ntrunk\"). These rami consist of long, slender branches which accompany the\n[lumbar arteries](/wiki/Lumbar_arteries \"Lumbar arteries\") around the sides of\nthe vertebral bodies, beneath the [psoas major](/wiki/Psoas_major \"Psoas\nmajor\"). Their arrangement is somewhat irregular: one ganglion may give rami\nto two lumbar nerves, or one lumbar nerve may receive rami from two\n[ganglia](/wiki/Ganglia \"Ganglia\").\n\nThe first and second, and sometimes the third and fourth lumbar nerves are\neach connected with the lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk by a [white ramus\ncommunicans](/wiki/White_ramus_communicans \"White ramus communicans\").\n\nThe nerves pass obliquely outward behind the psoas major, or between its\n[fasciculi](/wiki/Muscle_fascicle \"Muscle fascicle\"), distributing filaments\nto it and the [quadratus lumborum](/wiki/Quadratus_lumborum \"Quadratus\nlumborum\").\n\nThe first three and the greater part of the fourth are connected together in\nthis situation by anastomotic loops, and form the [lumbar\nplexus](/wiki/Lumbar_plexus \"Lumbar plexus\").\n\nThe smaller part of the fourth joins with the fifth to form the [lumbosacral\ntrunk](/wiki/Lumbosacral_trunk \"Lumbosacral trunk\"), which assists in the\nformation of the [sacral plexus](/wiki/Sacral_plexus \"Sacral plexus\"). The\nfourth nerve is named the [furcal\nnerve](/w/index.php?title=Furcal_nerve&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Furcal nerve\n\\(page does not exist\\)\"), from the fact that it is subdivided between the two\nplexuses.\n\n### Sacral nerves[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spinal_nerve&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Sacral nerves\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Gray828.png/220px-\nGray828.png)](/wiki/File:Gray828.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gray828.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nPlan of sacral and pudendal plexuses\n\nThe **sacral nerves** are the five pairs of spinal nerves which exit the\n[sacrum](/wiki/Sacrum \"Sacrum\") at the lower end of the [vertebral\ncolumn](/wiki/Human_vertebral_column \"Human vertebral column\"). The roots of\nthese nerves begin inside the vertebral column at the level of the [L1\nvertebra](/wiki/L1_vertebra \"L1 vertebra\"), where the [cauda\nequina](/wiki/Cauda_equina \"Cauda equina\") begins, and then descend into the\nsacrum.[2][3]\n\nThere are five paired sacral nerves, half of them arising through the sacrum\non the left side and the other half on the right side. Each nerve emerges in\ntwo divisions: one division through the [anterior sacral\nforamina](/wiki/Anterior_sacral_foramina \"Anterior sacral foramina\") and the\nother division through the [posterior sacral\nforamina](/wiki/Posterior_sacral_foramina \"Posterior sacral foramina\").[4]\n\nThe nerves divide into branches and the branches from different nerves join\nwith one another, some of them also joining with lumbar or coccygeal nerve\nbranches. These anastomoses of nerves form the [sacral\nplexus](/wiki/Sacral_plexus \"Sacral plexus\") and the [lumbosacral\nplexus](/wiki/Lumbosacral_plexus \"Lumbosacral plexus\"). The branches of these\nplexus give rise to nerves that supply much of the [hip](/wiki/Hip \"Hip\"),\n[thigh](/wiki/Thigh \"Thigh\"), [leg](/wiki/Leg \"Leg\") and [foot](/wiki/Foot\n\"Foot\").[5][6]\n\nThe sacral nerves have both [afferent](/wiki/Afferent_nerve_fiber \"Afferent\nnerve fiber\") and [efferent fibers](/wiki/Efferent_fibers \"Efferent fibers\"),\nthus they are responsible for part of the [sensory\nperception](/wiki/Sensory_perception \"Sensory perception\") and the movements\nof the lower extremities of the human body. From the S2, S3 and S4 arise the\npudendal nerve and parasympathetic fibers whose electrical potential supply\nthe [descending colon](/wiki/Descending_colon \"Descending colon\") and\n[rectum](/wiki/Rectum \"Rectum\"), [urinary bladder](/wiki/Urinary_bladder\n\"Urinary bladder\") and [genital organs](/wiki/Genital_organs \"Genital\norgans\"). These pathways have both afferent and efferent fibers and, this way,\nthey are responsible for conduction of sensory information from these pelvic\norgans to the [central nervous system](/wiki/Central_nervous_system \"Central\nnervous system\") (CNS) and motor impulses from the CNS to the pelvis that\ncontrol the movements of these pelvic organs.[7]\n\n### Coccygeal\nnerve[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spinal_nerve&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Coccygeal nerve\")]\n\nThe coccygeal nerve is the 31st pair of spinal nerves. It arises from the\nconus medullaris, and its anterior root helps form the [coccygeal\nplexus](/wiki/Coccygeal_plexus \"Coccygeal plexus\"). It does not divide into a\nmedial and lateral branch. It is distributed to the skin over the back of the\n[coccyx](/wiki/Coccyx \"Coccyx\").\n\n## Function[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Spinal_nerve&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Function\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Gray802.png/220px-\nGray802.png)](/wiki/File:Gray802.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gray802.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nAreas of distribution of the cutaneous branches of the posterior divisions of\nthe spinal nerves.
