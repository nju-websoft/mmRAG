She resided in a care home\n(first Stowey House and then Elm Tree House), affectionately nicknamed \"The\nDumping Ground\", and was a resident there for some time. Tracy is a tomboy\nwith behavioural problems, probably a consequence of her mother's abandonment\nof her and failure to show an interest in her. Known for her lies which\nexaggerate her mother's fame and fortune, she tried to convince herself\ncontinually her mother would one day appear. She was often reluctant to show\nher emotions, attributing tears to [hayfever](/wiki/Hayfever \"Hayfever\"). In\nlater series, writer Cam Lawson (portrayed by [Lisa\nColeman](/wiki/Lisa_Coleman_\\(actress\\) \"Lisa Coleman \\(actress\\)\")) and her\nnew husband Gary adopted Tracy.

Cam withdrew her accusation of fraud and Tracy was cleared of\nall charges, but was ordered to undergo community service by writing a column\nfor the local newspaper. Finding herself threatened by her adopted mother's\nangry answerphone messages, she returned to Elm Tree House seeking solace in\nMike, who offered her a job as a careworker.\n\nAlthough her new career did not begin well, she soon began to improve as a\ncareworker, although her actions put her boss Mike's career in jeopardy after\na protest she led resulted in Lily Kettle (Jess Williams) falling off the\nroof. Also, Tracy finds it hard to cope when Cam goes to [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), and ends up suffering a panic\nattack. Following this, Tracy continued working at Elm Tree House, using\namateur detective skills to unmask new careworker Denis Stockle as a smoker,\nsustaining minor injuries falling down stairs in panics, and meeting her\nchildhood rival Justine Littlewood ([Montana Thompson](/wiki/Montana_Thompson\n\"Montana Thompson\")) again.\n\nThe final episode saw Tracy preparing to leave Elm Tree House to leave for\nwork in another care home with better pay, soon after gaining a qualification\nas a care worker. After causing an accident which resulted in a roof\ncollapsing on Mike, and making sure everybody was alright, she left Elm Tree\nHouse for the last time.\n\nTracy is often mentioned in the spin-off 'The Dumping Ground'.

She has dark\nblonde, almost brown, hair and brown eyes.

Eventually, Tee decides not to be fostered as\nshe doesn’t want to leave her brother behind.\n\nIn \"Shadows\", Tee finds a trail of riddles, each leading to a different clue,\nwhich eventually leads her to the time capsule which was buried at The Dumping\nGround in _The Story of Tracy Beaker_.\n\nIn \"Summer Holiday\", she ruins a holiday by accidentally forgetting to close a\ngate and letting sheep get into the farm house where they are staying. When\nLily and Carmen plan to go to Lily's dads campsite, Tee goes on the bus to\nstop them but the bus moves and they are stuck on the bus until Wales.

Carmen goes with Tee leaving Lily on\nthe bus by herself. 5 seconds later the bus stops again and it's Lily. They\nwalk off through a wood. And Tee finds herself at a holiday place. Later they\nare on their new holiday, all thanks to Tee.\n\nIn _Oh, Mo_ , Tee was made to look after new, eccentric resident, Mo. She soon\nregretted her decision when Mo started clamouring for her company and saying\nthey were best friends. This led to an accident in which Mo was injured. Mike\ndecided that Mo shouldn't live in Elm Tree House after the incident, but the\nyoung people beg for Mo to stay, so he did.\n\nIn \"Hope\" Tee gets a letter from her mum, who wants to meet up with her and\nJohnny. Johnny tells her not to, as he thinks it might be a trap, but Tee goes\nto see her mum at the women's refuge and meets her baby sister, Hope. It is\nrevealed that Tee's mum has left her abusive boyfriend Keith.

He departed in [series 4](/wiki/The_Dumping_Ground_\\(series_4\\) \"The\nDumping Ground \\(series 4\\)\") during the episode _Two For Joy_.\n\nMo is a kind, eccentric kid in the Dumping Ground. He first appeared in \"Oh,\nMo!\" His age is 10, as of series 3 of [The Dumping\nGround](/wiki/The_Dumping_Ground \"The Dumping Ground\"). In series 4, Mo has\nshown an annoyance to younger residents like Joseph. Which is quite\nhypocritical, been as how Mo was when he first arrived at the dumping ground.\n\nThe Dumping Ground Series 1 - Mo arrived at the Elm Tree House prior to the\nepisode Oh, Mo! where he was made to share a room with Tyler. To Tyler's ire,\nMo enjoyed collecting rubbish from the bins (which he dubbed treasure, which\nhe made arts and crafts from) and would take it into their bedroom,\neffectively turning the bedroom into a rubbish dump. This eventually annoyed\nTyler to the point that one day, he took Mo's \"treasure\" and dumped it over\nthe stairs onto the ground floor, declaring that it was what he had to put up\nwith. Mo was told to take his \"treasure\" to the attic and Tyler ended up being\nmoved to Rick's bedroom, leading to Mo getting the room to himself, with which\nhe was very pleased and tried to give Tyler a hug (to Tyler's disgust). Whilst\nthe others (except Jody and Elektra) were out, Mo took belongings from the\nother residents' rooms and (with Floss's help) built an \"Ant Theme Park\" by\nplacing jam on the belongings to attract the ants, which he had brought into\nthe house. This unfortunately led to Mo receiving more ire from the Dumping\nGround residents, only to be stopped by Tee. Later, Mo offered to build a\nscarecrow to help scare birds away from Gina's vegetables, which he would\nbuild out of his \"treasure\". Mo did this with Tee's help, as she had\nbefriended Mo to help him settle in. Mo decided to declare Tee his \"best\nfriend\" and wanted to hang around her including sitting next to her at dinner,\nmuch to Tee's ire and the amusement of the other DG residents. The following\nmorning, Mo wanted to give his grandmother's pearls (which Jody and Elektra\nhad stolen) to Tee, but could not find him, so he went to ask Tee for help.\nUnfortunately, Tee had reached the end of her tether with Mo and went to\ndestroy Mo's scarecrow with a cricket bat. Tee succeeded in knocking the\nscarecrow down, which unfortunately landed on top of Mo, who had followed Tee.\nMo was taken to hospital and Mike intended for him to be moved into emergency\nfoster care as Mo was clearly not settling down at Elm Tree House. However,\nthe other kids realised that Mo was no different to them in that they all had\na rough start in life, so they rebuilt his scarecrow as a welcome home\npresent, saying that they wanted Mo to stay. Jody also returned the pearls she\nand Elektra had stolen (to Elektra's annoyance) so Mo could present them to\nTee as a gift. Tee refuses but agrees to take them in the end.\n\nIn \"Seriously Funny\", Tee and Carmen left for a sleepover at Lily's flat, Mo\ngave Tee a hug (as he was fond of doing) as the girls hugged each other. After\nthe girls left, he said that he wished he could go. The following day, Mo took\nTyler's practical joke toys on learning that Tyler no longer wished to play\npractical jokes.\n\nPrior to Scary Beasts, Mo purchased a \"magic\" egg, thinking that it would\nhatch into a bird. One night, the egg hatched. Mo declared this to the house\nthe following morning, declaring that it had hatched into a bird and it had\ngone missing. It later transpired that Mo's \"bird\" was in fact a snake, which\nJohnny and Elektra found. Mo decided to call his snake \"Mike\", which the\nothers joked would lead to confusion.\n\nThe Dumping Ground Series 2 - When Faith was admitted to hospital, Mo decided\nto make her a \"get well soon\" card, but ended up with glitter over his face in\nthe process. When Faith later returned from hospital, Mo greeted her saying\nthat they had made her a surprise. Faith was then heard trashing her room\n(annoyed about being in a wheelchair), leading to Mo commenting that she would\nnot like his invention (a watering can attached to a pole). Later, Mo decided\nto use one of Bailey's football boots to make shoe prints with, only for it to\nbe taken by Tyler and Rick, who were trying to sell Bailey's boots. The\nfollowing day, he, Harry and Floss (with whom he had become friends with by\nthis point) were watching the TV when Faith ordered them out to watch a film.\nWhen a training video for care children was being filmed at the Dumping\nGround, Mo was given an old camera for him to use. After getting the camera to\nwork, Mo filmed the other residents (including Johnny making a \"Care Kid\nSandwich\") which was later seen by the lady making the training video. On the\nday of Lily's leaving barbecue, Carmen tricked Mo into thinking that there was\ngold underneath the potatoes in the vegetable patch, as a way of getting out\nof her chores. Later that day, Mo found a golden wrapper in the vegetable\npatch and believed it to be treasure (when really it was from one of Floss's\nsweets). On the day the older residents went out to look for Frank, Mo was due\nto have a dentist appointment. Mo, fearing the dentist, hid in the garden, but\nwas found by Floss and Harry. Mo was coaxed out, only for a bird to poo on\nhim. Harry cheered up Mo, saying that when a bird pooed on you, it was lucky\n(something Sapphire had told him). Mo then found a pound coin on the ground\nand was then told by May-Li that his appointment had been cancelled as the\ndentist was ill. On learning that Frank had gone missing, Mo, Floss and Harry\nwaited for birds to poo on them, thinking that the lucky bird poo would lead\nto Frank being found. However, this initially did not work as Mo ended up\nchasing the birds away by running toward them and shouting at them to pick\nhim. Instead, Floss had Mo and Harry untie one of May-Li's washing lines while\nshe took bread to attract the birds while May-Li was distracted. Consequently,\nall three children were punished (by being made to tidy up the garden and take\nthe sheets in) when May-Li discovered what had happened with the bread. Some\ntime afterwards, the other DG residents teased Mo's snake, now renamed\n\"Rocky\", saying that he was boring. Out to prove otherwise, Mo purchased a box\nof locusts that escaped after Mike untapped the box and left it on the piano\nwith the lid open. Consequently, Mo, with Harry and Floss, set about rounding\nup the 50+ locusts from other places in the Dumping Ground. After finally\nrounding them up, Mo revealed to the rest of the DG why he had bought them:\nthey were bait for Rocky to perform tricks in a show he was putting on.\nUnfortunately, Rocky refused to respond to Mo's commands (despite having\nresponded in practice) even when Mo attempted to charm him with a recorder.\nFaith later suggested to Mo that Rocky was depressed, prompting Mo to give\nRocky to a man who owned numerous other snakes, on the reasoning that Mo could\nplay with his friends whenever he wanted and so wanted to let Rocky do the\nsame thing. When the DG residents held the \"Touch The Telly\" challenge, Mo was\nthe only care kid to not pick a side. Instead, he was appointed the referee\nand was responsible for seeing who was out of the game, how long people had\ntaken on their toilet breaks and how many they had been on. Like the other\nkids, Mo fell asleep in the lounge the following night and saw neither the\nfootball game nor the talent show. In I Have a Dream, the DG residents were\ninformed of a short story competition and May-Li decided to hold a competition\nin the house and would send off the winning entry. Mo decided that he wanted\nto submit a story, but had trouble deciding what it would be on (though he did\nget as far as the first line \"I like cheese\"). He was also made to go shopping\nwith Bailey, whom he annoyed by asking who decided where everything in the\nsupermarket was positioned. Mo later pestered Bailey by asking why he had not\nyet read his letter, saying that he would be excited to receive one, and\neventually sussed out that Bailey was dyslexic, going on to say that his dad\nwas dyslexic and that he had to read letters for him. Bailey initially denied\nbeing dyslexic, then later asked for Mo's help in reading it (albeit, claiming\nhe could not read it because the writing was untidy). Mo then decided to help\nBailey write a short story at the cost of writing his own story. Bailey went\non to win the short story. However, Mo revealed the plot when he started\nreading Bailey's story and when Carmen read the story for herself, she\nwondered how Mo could have known the plot it was Bailey's story. This led to\nJohnny accusing Bailey of bullying Mo to write his story, which led to Mo\nshouting that they had got it all wrong and storming out of the kitchen,\nleading to him telling May-Li about Bailey's problem afterwards. Bailey went\non to win the competition and won tickets for himself and another person to\ntake with him, so he picked Mo, who proceeded to give him a hug. When Harry\nwas told that he could not go to a wrestling tournament, he came up with the\nidea of having a wrestling tournament with one of the other DG kids. Mo\ndeclined to be Harry's opponent, but they both went to find Tyler, who agreed\nto be the announcer. Later, after Harry had had his costume made by Tee, Mo\nsuggested that Harry have a tattoo on his face, which he agreed to. On\nlearning that Floss was to be adopted, Mo asked her if she would still live at\nthe DG, only to be told by Harry that adoption meant Floss would be leaving\nand never coming back. This upset Mo, who told May-Li that she needed to turn\naway any parents who wanted to adopt him, to which May-Li said to him that Mo\nwas not going to be adopted and was only living at Ashdene Ridge until his\nparents were fit to take care of him. Some time afterwards, when Liam came to\nthe Dumping Ground to look for Frank, Mo answered to door to him. When asked\nwhere Frank was, Mo told Liam that he was at the cinema with Johnny, prompting\nLiam to leave, despite Mo offering to get Mike. Later when Liam came to\ntemporarily stay at the DG, Mo's part in the plan to get Faith her work\nplacement back was to sing \"Twelve Tiny Hours\" (a song Liam had written) with\nJohnny and Rick, but Mo's singing was so atrocious he decided that he did not\nwant to sing at all.\n\nThe Dumping Ground Series 3 - On the day of The Dumping Ground's open day in\n\"Party Games\", Mo helped to add food colouring some cupcakes for the guests.\nLater in the day, however, Mo decided to run a bath and poured the food\ncolouring that he had used on the cupcakes. The water overflowed the bath,\nfell into the living room downstairs (soaking Matt, Stephanie Brantston and\nCarmen) and also soaked Johnny'd bedroom as well. Mo was caught after he tried\nto get away from the living room and was made to show his hands which were\ncoloured red by the food colouring. Mo explained that he did this to stop the\nfostering party and prevent Carmen being fostered by the Brantstons, calling\nthem \"nasty people\". The day after the events in \"Grand Theft DG\", Mo was made\nto share with new boy, Ryan. Who arrived the following day. On the same day,\nMo discovered the purses that had gone missing had been dumped in a bin\noutside the DG. He was going to tell Mike, but was stopped by Ryan who\nconvinced him to show him first, then was convinced to keep quiet by Ryan on\nthe grounds that the police would implicate him as his fingerprints would be\non the purses, as Mo had told Ryan he had touched them a bit. Tee managed to\nget the truth out of Mo eventually after Mo started to talk at the kitchen\ntable, but then kept quiet. They searched the bins only to find the purses\nwere now gone. Tee and Mo confronted Ryan, who lied that he had not moved the\npurses. Later that day, while Ryan was speaking to Maude Gordon (Harry's\npotential foster sister, who had taken the money from the purses) in the\nattic, Mo followed Tee (who was recording Ryan and Maude's conversation) and\nsneezed, prompting Ryan to get Maude to turn herself in. In \"Stuck With You\",\nKazima noticed Mo was feeling down and not being his usual cheery self. Kazima\nbought Mo a \"Build Your Own Robot\" from a yard sale in the neighbour hood to\ncheer Mo up. But when Mo found that there were some pieces missing this made\nhim worse, causing him to shout at Kazima. Mo locked himself in Faith's old\nbedroom and built a fort out of boxes with some of her old belongings in. But\nall the boxes ended up falling on Mo. Mike and May-Li find Mo and manage to\nrescue him.
