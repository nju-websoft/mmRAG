It took its current name\nin 1935, then moved to a larger facility in [Williamsburg,\nBrooklyn](/wiki/Williamsburg,_Brooklyn \"Williamsburg, Brooklyn\") in 1952.[4]\nThe school moved to its current location in [Fresh Meadows,\nQueens](/wiki/Fresh_Meadows,_Queens \"Fresh Meadows, Queens\") in 1974 when it\nacquired the facility that formerly housed Bishop Reilly High School, a co-\neducational Catholic high school.
