The current\nsituation is different only in that six Indiana counties have since been moved\nfrom the Central time zone to the Eastern time zone.\n\nThe **history of standard time in the United States** began November 18, 1883,\nwhen [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") and\n[Canadian](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") railroads instituted [standard\ntime](/wiki/Standard_time \"Standard time\") in [time zones](/wiki/Time_zone\n\"Time zone\"). Before then, time of day was a local matter, and most cities and\ntowns used some form of local [solar time](/wiki/Solar_time \"Solar time\"),\nmaintained by some well-known clock (for example, on a church steeple or in a\njeweler's window). The new standard time system was not immediately embraced\nby all.\n\nUse of standard time gradually increased because of its obvious practical\nadvantages for communication and travel. Standard time in time zones was not\nestablished in U.S. law until the [Standard Time Act of\n1918](/wiki/1918_Standard_Time_Act \"1918 Standard Time Act\") of March 19,\n1918, also known as the Calder Act (15 USC 260).[1][2] The act also\nestablished [daylight saving time](/wiki/Daylight_saving_time \"Daylight saving\ntime\"), itself a contentious idea.\n\nDaylight saving time was repealed in 1919, but standard time in time zones\nremained in law, with the [Interstate Commerce\nCommission](/wiki/Interstate_Commerce_Commission \"Interstate Commerce\nCommission\") (ICC) having the authority over time zone boundaries. Daylight\ntime became a local matter. It was re-established nationally early in [World\nWar II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), and was continuously observed\nuntil the end of the war.\n\nAfter the war its use varied among states and localities. The [Uniform Time\nAct](/wiki/Uniform_Time_Act \"Uniform Time Act\") of 1966 provided\nstandardization in the dates of beginning and end of daylight time in the U.S.\nbut allowed for local exemptions from its observance. The act also continued\nthe authority of the ICC over time zone boundaries. In subsequent years, the\n[United States Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States\nCongress\") transferred the authority over time zones to the [U.S. Department\nof Transportation](/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Transportation \"U.S. Department of\nTransportation\") (DOT), modified (several times) the beginning date of\ndaylight time, and renamed the three westernmost time zones.\n\nTime zone boundaries have changed greatly since their original introduction\nand changes still occasionally occur. DOT issues press releases when these\nchanges are made. Generally, time zone boundaries have tended to shift\nwestward. Places on the eastern edge of a time zone can effectively move\nsunset an hour later (by the clock) by shifting to the time zone immediately\nto their east.\n\nIf they do so, the boundary of that zone is locally shifted to the west; the\naccumulation of such changes results in the long-term westward trend. The\nprocess is not inexorable, however, since the late sunrises experienced by\nsuch places during the winter may be regarded as too undesirable. Furthermore,\nunder the law, the principal standard for deciding on a time zone change is\nthe \"convenience of commerce\". Proposed time zone changes have been both\napproved and rejected based on this criterion, although most such proposals\nhave been accepted.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 War Time 1918 and 1942\n  * 2 Daylight Saving Time 1945 to 1966\n  * 3 DST 1966\n  * 4 DST 2007\n  * 5 Start and end dates of United States Daylight Saving Time\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 Notes\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## War Time 1918 and\n1942[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_time_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: War Time 1918 and 1942\")]\n\n\"War Time\" redirects here. This usage refers to the changes of the US War Time\nAct, not a general period of [war](/wiki/War \"War\").\n\nDaylight saving time was established by the [Standard Time\nAct](/wiki/Standard_Time_Act \"Standard Time Act\") of 1918. The Act was\nintended to save electricity for seven months of the year, during [World War\nI](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\").[3] DST was repealed in 1919 over a\nPresidential veto,[4] but standard time in time zones remained in law, with\nthe [Interstate Commerce Commission](/wiki/Interstate_Commerce_Commission\n\"Interstate Commerce Commission\") (ICC) having the authority over time zone\nboundaries. Daylight time became a local matter.\n\nDuring [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), Congress enacted the\n[War Time Act](/w/index.php?title=War_Time_Act&action=edit&redlink=1 \"War Time\nAct \\(page does not exist\\)\") (56 Stat. 9) on January 20, 1942. Year-round DST\nwas reinstated in the United States on February 9, 1942, again as a wartime\nmeasure to conserve energy resources.[5] This remained in effect until after\nthe end of the war. The Amendment to the War Time Act (59 Stat. 537), enacted\nSeptember 25, 1945, ended DST as of September 30, 1945. During this period,\nthe official designation War Time was used for year-round DST. For example,\nEastern War Time (EWT) would be the equivalent of Eastern Daylight Time during\nthis period.\n\n## Daylight Saving Time 1945 to\n1966[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_time_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Daylight Saving Time 1945 to 1966\")]\n\nFrom 1945 to 1966 U.S. federal law did not address DST. States and cities were\nfree to observe DST or not, and most places that did observe DST did so from\nthe last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in September. In the mid-1950s\nmany areas in the northeastern United States began extending DST to the last\nSunday in October. The lack of standardization led to a patchwork where some\nareas observed DST while adjacent areas did not, and it was not unheard of to\nhave to reset a clock several times during a short trip (e.g., bus drivers\noperating on [West Virginia Route 2](/wiki/West_Virginia_Route_2 \"West\nVirginia Route 2\") between [Moundsville, West\nVirginia](/wiki/Moundsville,_West_Virginia \"Moundsville, West Virginia\"), and\n[Steubenville, Ohio](/wiki/Steubenville,_Ohio \"Steubenville, Ohio\") had to\nreset their watches seven times over 35 miles).[6]\n\nIn summer 1960 Aprilâ€“October Daylight Time was nearly universal in\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and states east and north of there. In\nMinnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky and Virginia and states north and east of\nthere, some areas had it and some did not. Except for California and Nevada,\nwhich had April-Sept Daylight Time, 99% of the rest of the country used\nStandard Time year-round. (The Official Guide says \"State law prohibits the\nobservance of \"Daylight Saving\" time in Kentucky but Anchorage, Louisville and\nShelbyville will advance their clocks one hour from Central Standard time for\nthe period April 24 to October 29, inclusive.\")\n\nIn the middle 1960s the airline and other transportation industries lobbied\nfor uniformity of Daylight dates in the United States.\n\n## DST\n1966[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_time_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: DST 1966\")]\n\nThe U.S. federal [Uniform Time Act](/wiki/Uniform_Time_Act \"Uniform Time Act\")\nbecame law on April 13, 1966 and it mandated that DST begin nationwide on the\nlast Sunday in April and end on the last Sunday in October, effective in 1967.\nThe act explicitly preempted all previously enacted state laws related to the\nbeginning and ending of DST. Any state that wanted to be exempt from DST could\ndo so by passing a state law, provided that it exempted the entire state, and\nAlaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Indiana, and Michigan chose to do so. However,\nAlaska, Indiana, and Michigan subsequently chose to observe DST. The law was\namended in 1972 to permit states that straddle a time zone boundary to exempt\nthe entire area of the state lying in one time zone. Indiana chose to exempt\nthe portion of the state lying in the Eastern Time Zone; however, that\nexemption was eliminated in 2006 and the entire state of Indiana now observes\nDST, leaving Arizona (with the exception of the [Navajo Indian\nReservation](/wiki/Navajo_Indian_Reservation \"Navajo Indian Reservation\")) and\nHawaii as the only two states not to observe DST. On July 8, 1986, President\n[Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\") signed the Federal Fire\nPrevention and Control Act of 1986 into law that contained a daylight saving\n[rider](/wiki/Rider_\\(legislation\\) \"Rider \\(legislation\\)\") authored by\nSenator [Slade Gorton](/wiki/Slade_Gorton \"Slade Gorton\") (R-WA).[3] The\nstarting date of DST was amended to the first Sunday in April effective in\n1987. DST continued to end on the last Sunday in October. While the states\nretain the capability to exempt themselves from DST, they are forbidden by the\n1966 federal law (15 USC 260a(b))[7] from increasing a state's time spent on\nDST, unless the [United States Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United\nStates Congress\") does this for the entire nation.\n\nIn response to the [1973 energy crisis](/wiki/1973_energy_crisis \"1973 energy\ncrisis\"), DST in the United States began earlier in both 1974 and 1975,\ncommencing on the first Sunday in January (January 6) in the former year and\nthe last Sunday in February (February 23) in the latter. The extension of\ndaylight saving time was not continued due to public opposition to late\nsunrise times during the winter months. In 1976, the United States reverted to\nthe schedule set in the Uniform Time Act.\n\n## DST\n2007[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_time_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: DST 2007\")]\n\nStarting March 11, 2007, DST was extended another four to five weeks, from the\nsecond Sunday of March to the first Sunday of November. The change was\nintroduced by [Representatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"United States House of Representatives\") [Fred Upton](/wiki/Fred_Upton \"Fred\nUpton\") (R-MI) and [Edward Markey](/wiki/Edward_Markey \"Edward Markey\") (D-MA)\nand added to the [Energy Policy Act of 2005](/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005\n\"Energy Policy Act of 2005\"); the [House](/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives\n\"U.S. House of Representatives\") had originally approved a motion that would\nhave extended DST even farther from the first Sunday in March to the last\nSunday in November, but Senators [Jeff Bingaman](/wiki/Jeff_Bingaman \"Jeff\nBingaman\") (D-NM) and [Pete Domenici](/wiki/Pete_Domenici \"Pete Domenici\")\n(R-NM) agreed to scale back the proposal in [conference\ncommittee](/wiki/Conference_committee \"Conference committee\") due to\ncomplaints from farmers and the airline industry. Proponents claimed that the\nextension would save \"the equivalent of\" 10,000 barrels (1,600 m3) of\n[oil](/wiki/Petroleum \"Petroleum\") per day, but this figure was based on [U.S.\nDepartment of Energy](/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Energy \"U.S. Department of\nEnergy\") information from the 1970s, the accuracy and relevance of which the\nDoE no longer stands by. Later studies by the U.S. Department of Energy and\nthe California Energy Commission have predicted much smaller energy\nbenefits.[8] There is very little recent research on what the actual positive\neffects, if any, might be.\n\nSince DST moves [sunrise](/wiki/Sunrise \"Sunrise\") one hour later by the\nclock, late sunrise times become a problem when DST is observed either too far\nbefore the [vernal equinox](/wiki/Vernal_equinox \"Vernal equinox\") or too far\nafter the [autumnal equinox](/wiki/Autumnal_equinox \"Autumnal equinox\").\nBecause of this, the extension was greeted with criticism by those concerned\nfor the safety of children who would have been forced to travel to school\nbefore sunrise, especially in the month of March. In addition, the airline\nindustry was especially concerned if DST were to be extended through to the\nlast Sunday in November, as this is very often (6 out of every 7 years) the\nSunday after Thanksgiving. This is one of the busiest travel days at American\nairports, and could have resulted in much havoc among travelers who forgot\nthat the clocks were changing that day.\n\nIf the original proposal to extend DST through the last Sunday in November had\nbeen adopted, the entire United States, with the exception of the states that\nexempted themselves, would have experienced the latest sunrises of the year\nduring the month of November, which would have approached the extremely late\nsunrise times when DST went into effect on January 6, 1974 due to the [1973\nenergy crisis](/wiki/1973_energy_crisis \"1973 energy crisis\") creeping after 9\nam in places like [New Salem, North Dakota](/wiki/New_Salem,_North_Dakota \"New\nSalem, North Dakota\") at the northwestern edges of time zones.\n\n## Start and end dates of United States Daylight Saving\nTime[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_time_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Start and
