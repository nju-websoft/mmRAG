He worked with a number of musicians\nand vocal coach Roger Love.[6] Cooper said, \"by the end he just kind of\nstarted developing into his own sort of creation. If I had another year of\nprep, it would have been complete rock, but now it's some sort of hybrid.\"[6]\n\n## Writing and\nrecording[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Star_Is_Born_\\(2018_soundtrack\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Writing and recording\")]\n\nCooper described the soundtrack \"an evolution, like the story.\"[7] Gaga and\nCooper were writing songs for the soundtrack during filming, leading to \"so\nmany different incarnations of each song.\"[7] Cooper added that \"the music\nreally became a character in the movie. There is no lyric that's ever in any\npoint of the movie that doesn't have exactly to do with where one of them is\nor hopes to be or regrets being. That was our launching pad and then it was\njust about discovering what songs fit in the right places.\"[7] [Jason\nIsbell](/wiki/Jason_Isbell \"Jason Isbell\") wrote a song for Cooper's\ncharacter, which became \"the sword with which a lot of the music spawned from\n[Cooper]\". Isbell sent the song through [Dave Cobb](/wiki/Dave_Cobb \"Dave\nCobb\"), a [Nashville](/wiki/Nashville \"Nashville\")-based producer with whom\nCooper had been collaborating.[8]\n\nCooper approached [Lukas Nelson](/wiki/Lukas_Nelson_%26_Promise_of_the_Real\n\"Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real\") (son of country music singer [Willie\nNelson](/wiki/Willie_Nelson \"Willie Nelson\")) after seeing him perform at\n[Desert Trip](/wiki/Desert_Trip \"Desert Trip\") in October 2016 and asked him\nto work on the film as a music consultant.[9] Nelson said he began \"writing\nsongs for the movie, just for the heck of it, and sending them over to the\nproducer, and they started liking them. Then Lady Gaga came by and I met her\nand we clicked. We became good friends, and we started writing together.\"[10]\nGaga, in turn, provided backing vocals on two tracks on Nelson's self-titled\nalbum released in 2017.[11] Nelson and his band, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the\nReal, appear in the film as Cooper's backing band.[6]\n\nGaga reunited with producer [Mark Ronson](/wiki/Mark_Ronson \"Mark Ronson\") and\nsongwriter [Hillary Lindsey](/wiki/Hillary_Lindsey \"Hillary Lindsey\"), who had\nboth contributed to her previous studio album _[Joanne](/wiki/Joanne_\\(album\\)\n\"Joanne \\(album\\)\")_ (2016).[6] She worked with recurring collaborator [DJ\nWhite Shadow](/wiki/DJ_White_Shadow \"DJ White Shadow\") on the soundtrack's\nmore pop-oriented numbers performed by her character Ally. Much of the album\nwas recorded live on set, at Gaga's insistence.[1][6]\n\n## Music and\nlyrics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Star_Is_Born_\\(2018_soundtrack\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Music and lyrics\")]\n\n_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_ described\nthe soundtrack as \"integral to the plotline\", adding that \"many of the lyrics\nare about wanting and longing for change, but noting the struggle. Some\nexpress the great love and beautiful bond the booze-addled rock star (Jackson\nMaine, played by Cooper) and neophyte singer-songwriter (Ally, played by Lady\nGaga) have for each other\", and concluding that \"the music stands up, movie or\nno movie. They are timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like\nsongs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit\nto the core of the listener.\"[12]\n\n##\nRelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Star_Is_Born_\\(2018_soundtrack\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Release\")]\n\nThe soundtrack's track list and release date were announced on August 30,\n2018.[4] [Interscope Records](/wiki/Interscope_Records \"Interscope Records\")\ntweeted that the album \"features 19 songs in a wide range of musical styles +\n15 dialogue tracks that will take you on a journey that mirrors the experience\nof seeing the film.\"[13] Its track\n\"[Shallow](/wiki/Shallow_\\(Lady_Gaga_and_Bradley_Cooper_song\\) \"Shallow \\(Lady\nGaga and Bradley Cooper song\\)\")\" was released on September 27 as the album's\nlead single.[14]\n\n## Critical\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Star_Is_Born_\\(2018_soundtrack\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Critical reception\")]\n\nProfessional ratings  \n---  \nAggregate scores  \nSource| Rating  \n[Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\")| 78/100[15]  \nReview scores  \nSource| Rating  \n[AllMusic](/wiki/AllMusic \"AllMusic\")| ![4/5\nstars](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-\nStar_empty.svg.png)[16]  \n_[The Daily Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph \"The Daily Telegraph\")_|\n![3/5\nstars](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-\nStar_empty.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-\nStar_empty.svg.png)[17]  \n_[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_| ![4/5\nstars](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-\nStar_empty.svg.png)[18]  \n_[NME](/wiki/NME \"NME\")_| ![4/5\nstars](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-\nStar_empty.svg.png)[19]  \n_[Pitchfork](/wiki/Pitchfork_\\(website\\) \"Pitchfork \\(website\\)\")_|\n7.4/10[20]  \n_[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_| ![4/5\nstars](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-\nStar_empty.svg.png)[21]  \n_[Slant Magazine](/wiki/Slant_Magazine \"Slant Magazine\")_| ![2.5/5\nstars](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-\nStar_full.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-\nStar_half.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-\nStar_empty.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-\nStar_empty.svg.png)[22]  \n  \nThe soundtrack received positive response from critics.

It became Gaga's fourth album to reach\nnumber one in the nation and first since _[Artpop](/wiki/Artpop \"Artpop\")_\n(2013), as well as Cooper's first entry on the chart.[30][31] The soundtrack\nwas then displaced by [Jess Glynne](/wiki/Jess_Glynne \"Jess Glynne\")'s\n_[Always In Between](/wiki/Always_In_Between \"Always In Between\")_ the\nfollowing week, and it fell to number two, selling 24,732 equivalent\nunits.[32][33] For the week ending November 1, 2018, the soundtrack moved back\natop the chart with 24,982 copies sold (including 6,645 from sales-equivalent\nstreams). \"Shallow\" also reached the top of the [UK Singles\nChart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\") that week, making Gaga and\nCooper score an [Official UK Chart\ndouble](/wiki/List_of_artists_who_have_achieved_simultaneous_number-\none_UK_Single_and_Album \"List of artists who have achieved simultaneous\nnumber-one UK Single and Album\"), this being Gaga's third time to do\nso.[34][35]\n\n_A Star Is Born_ opened at number one in Ireland and Scotland,[36][37] and was\nGaga's third number one in the former.[38] During its third week atop the\nIrish chart, the soundtrack attained its highest sales tally.[39] In France,\nthe soundtrack sold 8,700 units and debuted at number seven on the [SNEP\nAlbums Chart](/wiki/SNEP \"SNEP\"), and held the same position the next week\nwith another 8,000 units.[40][41] In Australia, _A Star Is Born_ entered at\nnumber three on the [ARIA Albums Chart](/wiki/ARIA_Charts \"ARIA Charts\"),\ngiving Gaga her seventh top 10 album in the country and her sixth to reach the\ntop three.[42] Two weeks later, the soundtrack reached the top of the charts,\nbecoming Gaga's third album to reach the Australian charts summit after _The\nFame Monster_ and _Born This Way_.[43] The soundtrack debuted at number six in\nthe [New Zealand Albums Chart](/wiki/Recorded_Music_NZ \"Recorded Music NZ\"),\nand after two weeks reached the top.[44]\n\n## Track\nlisting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Star_Is_Born_\\(2018_soundtrack\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Track listing\")]\n\nStandard version[45]  \n---  \nNo.| Title| Writer(s)| Producer(s)| Length  \n1.| \"Intro\"|  |  | 0:20  \n2.| \"Black Eyes\" (performed by [Bradley Cooper](/wiki/Bradley_Cooper \"Bradley\nCooper\"))|\n\n  * Cooper\n  * [Lukas Nelson](/wiki/Lukas_Nelson \"Lukas Nelson\")\n\n|\n\n  * Cooper\n  * Nelson\n  * [Lady Gaga](/wiki/Lady_Gaga \"Lady Gaga\")[a][b]\n\n| 3:03  \n3.| \"[Somewhere Over the Rainbow](/wiki/Over_the_Rainbow \"Over the Rainbow\")\"\n(dialogue; featuring [Lady Gaga](/wiki/Lady_Gaga \"Lady Gaga\"))|\n\n  * [Harold Arlen](/wiki/Harold_Arlen \"Harold Arlen\")\n  * [E.Y.
