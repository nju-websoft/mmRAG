Each episode is based around a series of\ncyclical events that occur along the way during Dora's travels, along with\nobstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have\nto solve (with \"assistance\" from the viewing audience) relating to\n[riddles](/wiki/Riddles \"Riddles\"), the Spanish language, or counting. Common\nrituals may involve Dora's encounters with Swiper, a [bipedal](/wiki/Bipedal\n\"Bipedal\"), [anthropomorphic](/wiki/Anthropomorphic \"Anthropomorphic\") masked\nthieving [fox](/wiki/Fox \"Fox\") whose theft of the possessions of others must\nbe prevented through [fourth wall](/wiki/Fourth_wall \"Fourth wall\")-breaking\ninteraction with the viewer. To stop Swiper, Dora must say \"Swiper no swiping\"\nthree times. However, on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other\npeople, the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora\nlocate the stolen items. Another obstacle involves encounters with another one\nof the program's antagonists; the \"Grumpy Old Troll\" dwelling beneath a\n[bridge](/wiki/Bridge \"Bridge\") that Dora and Boots must cross, who challenges\nthem with a riddle before permitting them the past that needs to be solved\nwith the viewer's help. Known for the constant breaking of the fourth-wall\ndepicted in every episode, the audience is usually presented to two primary\nlandmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination, normally\nbeing challenged with games or puzzles along the way. The episode always ends\nwith Dora successfully reaching the locale, singing the \"We Did It!\" song with\nBoots in triumph.\n\nOn numerous occasions, television specials have been aired for the series in\nwhich the usual events of regular episodes are altered, threatened, or\nreplaced. Usually said specials will present Dora with a bigger, more\nwhimsical adventure than usual or with a magical task that must be fulfilled,\nor perhaps even offer a series of different adventures for Boots and Dora to\ntravel through. They might be presented with an unusual, difficult task (such\nas assisting Swiper in his attempts to be erased from Santa Claus's Naughty\nList) that normally is not featured in average episodes, or challenge Dora\nwith a goal that must be achieved (such as the emancipation of a trapped\n[mermaid](/wiki/Mermaid \"Mermaid\")). Sometimes, the specials have involved the\ndebut of new characters, such as the birth of Dora's superpowered twin baby\nsiblings and the introduction of the enchanted anthropomorphic\n[stars](/wiki/Stars \"Stars\") that accompany Dora on many of her quests.\n\n## Voices\n\n  * **Dora Márquez**[2] (aka **Dora the Explorer**): [Kathleen Herles](/wiki/Kathleen_Herles \"Kathleen Herles\") (2000–2007), [Caitlin Sanchez](/wiki/Caitlin_Sanchez \"Caitlin Sanchez\") (2008–2011), [Fátima Ptacek](/wiki/F%C3%A1tima_Ptacek \"Fátima Ptacek\") (2012–2014)\n  * **Boots:** [Harrison Chad](/wiki/Harrison_Chad \"Harrison Chad\") (2000–2007), [Regan Mizrahi](/wiki/Regan_Mizrahi \"Regan Mizrahi\") (2008–2012), Koda Gursoy (2012-2014)\n  * **Backpack:** Sasha Toro (2000–2007), Alexandria Suarez (2008–2014)\n  * **Swiper:** [Marc Weiner](/wiki/Marc_Weiner \"Marc Weiner\") (2000–2014)\n  * **Map:** [Marc Weiner](/wiki/Marc_Weiner \"Marc Weiner\") (2000–2014)\n  * **Isa the Iguana:** Ashley Fleming (2000–2007), Lenique Vincent (2008–2011), [Skai Jackson](/wiki/Skai_Jackson \"Skai Jackson\") (2012–2014)\n  * **Tico the Squirrel:** Jose Zelaya (2002–2007), Jean Carlos Celi (2008–2014)\n  * **Benny the Bull:** [Jake Burbage](/wiki/Jake_Burbage \"Jake Burbage\") (2000–2007), [Matt Gumley](/wiki/Matthew_Gumley \"Matthew Gumley\") (2008–2014)\n  * **Big Red Chicken** : Chris Gifford (2000–2014)\n  * **Explorer Stars:** Christiana Anbri, Henry Gifford, Katie Gifford, Aisha Shickler, Muhammed Cunningham, Jose Zeleya\n  * **Diego:** Felipe and Andre Dieppa (2003–2006), [Jake T.
