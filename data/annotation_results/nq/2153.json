Due\nto their different [ontogenetic](/wiki/Ontogenetic \"Ontogenetic\") origins, the\nepithalamus and the perithalamus are formally distinguished from the thalamus\nproper.\n\nThe thalamus comprises a system of [lamellae](/wiki/Lamella_\\(anatomy\\)\n\"Lamella \\(anatomy\\)\") (made up of [myelinated](/wiki/Myelin \"Myelin\")\n[fibers](/wiki/Axon \"Axon\")) separating different thalamic subparts.

It transmits information to\nthe thalamus about pain, temperature, itch and crude touch. There are two main\nparts: the [lateral spinothalamic tract](/wiki/Lateral_spinothalamic_tract\n\"Lateral spinothalamic tract\"), which transmits pain and temperature, and the\n[anterior (or ventral) spinothalamic tract](/wiki/Anterior_spinothalamic_tract\n\"Anterior spinothalamic tract\"), which transmits crude touch and pressure.\n\n## Function[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thalamus&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Function\")]\n\nThe thalamus has multiple functions, generally believed to act as a relay\nstation, or [hub](/wiki/Hub_\\(network_science\\) \"Hub \\(network science\\)\"),\nrelaying information between different subcortical areas and the [cerebral\ncortex](/wiki/Cerebral_cortex \"Cerebral cortex\").[13] In particular, every\nsensory system (with the exception of the [olfactory\nsystem](/wiki/Olfactory_system \"Olfactory system\")) includes a thalamic\nnucleus that receives sensory signals and sends them to the associated primary\ncortical area.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] For the visual system, for example, inputs from\nthe [retina](/wiki/Retina \"Retina\") are sent to the [lateral geniculate\nnucleus](/wiki/Lateral_geniculate_nucleus \"Lateral geniculate nucleus\") of the\nthalamus, which in turn projects to the [visual cortex](/wiki/Visual_cortex\n\"Visual cortex\") in the [occipital lobe](/wiki/Occipital_lobe \"Occipital\nlobe\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] The thalamus is believed to both process sensory information as\nwell as relay it—each of the primary sensory relay areas receives strong\nfeedback connections from the cerebral cortex.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nSimilarly the [medial geniculate nucleus](/wiki/Medial_geniculate_nucleus\n\"Medial geniculate nucleus\") acts as a key [auditory](/wiki/Auditory_system\n\"Auditory system\") relay between the [inferior\ncolliculus](/wiki/Inferior_colliculus \"Inferior colliculus\") of the\n[midbrain](/wiki/Midbrain \"Midbrain\") and the [primary auditory\ncortex](/wiki/Primary_auditory_cortex \"Primary auditory cortex\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\n[ventral posterior nucleus](/wiki/Ventral_posterior_nucleus \"Ventral posterior\nnucleus\") is a key [somatosensory](/wiki/Somatosensory \"Somatosensory\") relay,\nwhich sends touch and [proprioceptive](/wiki/Proprioceptive \"Proprioceptive\")\ninformation to the [primary somatosensory\ncortex](/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex \"Primary somatosensory\ncortex\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe thalamus also plays an important role in regulating states of [sleep and\nwakefulness](/wiki/Neuroscience_of_sleep \"Neuroscience of sleep\").[14]\nThalamic nuclei have strong reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex,\nforming [thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits](/wiki/Thalamo-cortico-\nthalamic_circuits \"Thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits\") that are believed to be\ninvolved with [consciousness](/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nthalamus plays a major role in regulating arousal, the level of awareness, and\nactivity. Damage to the thalamus can lead to permanent [coma](/wiki/Coma\n\"Coma\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe role of the thalamus in the more anterior [pallidal](/wiki/Pallidal\n\"Pallidal\") and [nigral](/wiki/Nigral \"Nigral\") territories in the [basal\nganglia](/wiki/Basal_ganglia \"Basal ganglia\") system disturbances is\nrecognized but still poorly understood. The contribution of the thalamus to\nvestibular or to [tectal](/wiki/Tectal \"Tectal\") functions is almost ignored.\nThe thalamus has been thought of as a \"relay\" that simply forwards signals to\nthe cerebral cortex. Newer research suggests that thalamic function is more\nselective.[15] Many different functions are linked to various regions of the\nthalamus. This is the case for many of the sensory systems (except for the\nolfactory system), such as the [auditory](/wiki/Auditory_system \"Auditory\nsystem\"), [somatic](/wiki/Somatic_sensory_system \"Somatic sensory system\"),\n[visceral](/wiki/Visceral \"Visceral\"), [gustatory](/wiki/Gustatory\n\"Gustatory\") and [visual systems](/wiki/Visual_system \"Visual system\") where\nlocalized lesions provoke specific sensory deficits. A major role of the\nthalamus is support of motor and language systems, and much of the circuitry\nimplicated for these systems is shared. The thalamus is _functionally\nconnected_ to the [hippocampus](/wiki/Hippocampus \"Hippocampus\")[16] as part\nof the extended hippocampal system at the thalamic anterior nuclei[17] with\nrespect to spatial memory and spatial sensory datum they are crucial for human\nepisodic memory and rodent event memory.[18][19] There is support for the\nhypothesis that thalamic regions connection to particular parts of the mesio-\ntemporal lobe provide differentiation of the functioning of recollective and\nfamiliarity memory.[11]\n\nThe neuronal information processes necessary for motor control were proposed\nas a network involving the thalamus as a subcortical motor center.[20] Through\ninvestigations of the anatomy of the brains of primates[21] the nature of the\ninterconnected tissues of the [cerebellum](/wiki/Cerebellum \"Cerebellum\") to\nthe multiple motor cortices suggested that the thalamus fulfills a key\nfunction in providing the specific channels from the basal ganglia and\n[cerebellum](/wiki/Cerebellum \"Cerebellum\") to the cortical motor\nareas.[22][23] In an investigation of the saccade and antisaccade[24] motor\nresponse in three monkeys, the thalamic regions were found to be involved in\nthe generation of antisaccade eye-movement.[25]\n\n## Development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thalamus&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Development\")]\n\nThe thalamic complex is composed of the perithalamus (or prethalamus,\npreviously also known as ventral thalamus), the mid-diencephalic organiser\n(which forms later the [zona limitans\nintrathalamica](/wiki/Zona_limitans_intrathalamica \"Zona limitans\nintrathalamica\") (ZLI) ) and the thalamus (dorsal thalamus).[26][27] The\ndevelopment of the thalamus can be subdivided into three steps.[28] The\nthalamus is the largest structure deriving from the embryonic\n[diencephalon](/wiki/Diencephalon \"Diencephalon\"), the posterior part of the\nforebrain situated between the midbrain and the cerebrum.\n\n### Early brain\ndevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thalamus&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Early brain development\")]\n\nAfter [neurulation](/wiki/Neurulation \"Neurulation\") the anlage of the\n[prethalamus](/wiki/Prethalamus \"Prethalamus\") and the thalamus is induced\nwithin the neural tube. Data from different vertebrate model organisms support\na model in which the interaction between two [transcription\nfactors](/wiki/Transcription_factor \"Transcription factor\"), Fez and Otx, are\nof decisive importance. Fez is expressed in the prethalamus, and functional\nexperiments show that Fez is required for prethalamus formation.[29][30]\nPosteriorly, Otx1 and Otx2 abut the expression domain of Fez and are required\nfor proper development of the thalamus.[31][32]\n\n### Formation of progenitor\ndomains[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thalamus&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Formation of progenitor domains\")]\n\nEarly in thalamic development two progenitor domains form, a caudal domain\n(TH-C) and a rostral domain (TH-R). The caudal domain gives rise to all of the\nglutamatergic neurons in the adult thalamus while the rostral domain gives\nrise to all of the GABAergic neurons in the adult thalamus.[33]\n\n### The formation of the mid-diencephalic organiser\n(MDO)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thalamus&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section:\nThe formation of the mid-diencephalic organiser \\(MDO\\)\")]\n\nAt the interface between the expression domains of Fez and Otx, the mid-\ndiencephalic organizer (MDO, also called the ZLI organiser) is induced within\nthe thalamic [anlage](/wiki/Primordium \"Primordium\"). The MDO is the central\nsignalling organizer in the thalamus. A lack of the organizer leads to the\nabsence of the thalamus. The MDO matures from ventral to dorsal during\ndevelopment. Members of the [SHH](/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog \"Sonic hedgehog\")\nfamily and of the [Wnt](/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway \"Wnt signaling pathway\")\nfamily are the main principal signals emitted by the MDO.\n\nBesides its importance as signalling center, the organizer matures into the\nmorphological structure of the [zona limitans intrathalamica\n(ZLI)](/wiki/Zona_limitans_intrathalamica \"Zona limitans intrathalamica\").\n\n### Maturation and parcellation of the\nthalamus[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thalamus&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Maturation and parcellation of the thalamus\")]\n\nAfter its induction, the MDO starts to orchestrate the development of the\nthalamic anlage by release of signalling molecules such as\n[SHH](/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog \"Sonic hedgehog\").[34] In mice, the function of\nsignaling at the MDO has not been addressed directly due to a complete absence\nof the [diencephalon](/wiki/Diencephalon \"Diencephalon\") in SHH mutants.[35]\n\nStudies in chicks have shown that SHH is both necessary and sufficient for\nthalamic gene induction.[36] In [zebrafish](/wiki/Zebrafish \"Zebrafish\"), it\nwas shown that the expression of two SHH genes, SHH-a and SHH-b (formerly\ndescribed as twhh) mark the MDO territory, and that SHH signaling is\nsufficient for the molecular differentiation of both the prethalamus and the\nthalamus but is not required for their maintenance and SHH signaling from the\nMDO/alar plate is sufficient for the maturation of prethalamic and thalamic\nterritory while ventral Shh signals are dispensable.[37]\n\nThe exposure to SHH leads to differentiation of thalamic neurons. SHH\nsignaling from the MDO induces a posterior-to-anterior wave of expression the\nproneural gene [Neurogenin1](/wiki/Neurogenins \"Neurogenins\") in the major\n(caudal) part of the thalamus, and Ascl1 (formerly Mash1) in the remaining\nnarrow stripe of rostral thalamic cells immediately adjacent to the MDO, and\nin the prethalamus.[38][39]\n\nThis zonation of proneural gene expression leads to the differentiation of\nglutamatergic relay neurons from the Neurogenin1+ precursors and of GABAergic\ninhibitory neurons from the Ascl1+ precursors. In fish, selection of these\nalternative neurotransmitter fates is controlled by the dynamic expression of\nHer6 the homolog of [HES1](/wiki/HES1 \"HES1\"). Expression of this hairy-like\nbHLH [transcription factor](/wiki/Transcription_factor \"Transcription\nfactor\"), which represses Neurogenin but is required for Ascl1, is\nprogressively lost from the caudal thalamus but maintained in the prethalamus\nand in the stripe of rostral thalamic cells. In addition, studies on chick and\nmice have shown that blocking the Shh pathway leads to absence of the rostral\nthalamus and substantial decrease of the caudal thalamus. The rostral thalamus\nwill give rise to the reticular nucleus mainly whereby the caudal thalamus\nwill form the relay thalamus and will be further subdivided in the [thalamic\nnuclei](/wiki/Thalamic_nuclei \"Thalamic nuclei\").[28]\n\nIn humans, a common genetic variation in the promotor region of the [serotonin\ntransporter](/wiki/Serotonin_transporter \"Serotonin transporter\") (the SERT-\nlong and -short allele: [5-HTTLPR](/wiki/5-HTTLPR \"5-HTTLPR\")) has been shown\nto affect the development of several regions of the thalamus in adults. People\nwho inherit two short [alleles](/wiki/Allele \"Allele\") (SERT-ss) have more\nneurons and a larger volume in the [pulvinar](/wiki/Pulvinar_nucleus \"Pulvinar\nnucleus\") and possibly the limbic regions of the thalamus. Enlargement of the\nthalamus provides an anatomical basis for why people who inherit two SERT-ss\nalleles are more vulnerable to [major\ndepression](/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder \"Major depressive disorder\"),\n[posttraumatic stress disorder](/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder\n\"Posttraumatic stress disorder\"), and suicide.[40]\n\n## Clinical\nsignificance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thalamus&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Clinical significance\")]\n\nA cerebrovascular accident ([stroke](/wiki/Stroke \"Stroke\")) can lead to the\n[thalamic syndrome](/wiki/Thalamic_syndrome \"Thalamic syndrome\"),[41] which\ninvolves a one-sided burning or aching sensation often accompanied by [mood\nswings](/wiki/Mood_disorder \"Mood disorder\"). Bilateral\n[ischemia](/wiki/Ischemia \"Ischemia\") of the area supplied by the paramedian\nartery can cause serious problems including [akinetic\nmutism](/wiki/Akinetic_mutism \"Akinetic mutism\"), and be accompanied by\n[oculomotor](/wiki/Oculomotor \"Oculomotor\") problems. A related concept is\n[thalamocortical dysrhythmia](/wiki/Thalamocortical_dysrhythmia\n\"Thalamocortical dysrhythmia\"). The occlusion of the [artery of\nPercheron](/wiki/Artery_of_Percheron \"Artery of Percheron\") can lead to a\nbilateral thalamus infarction.\n\n[Korsakoff's syndrome](/wiki/Korsakoff%27s_syndrome \"Korsakoff's syndrome\")\nstems from damage to the [mammillary body](/wiki/Mammillary_body \"Mammillary\nbody\"), the [mammillothalamic fasciculus](/wiki/Mammillothalamic_fasciculus\n\"Mammillothalamic fasciculus\") or the thalamus.\n\n[Fatal familial insomnia](/wiki/Fatal_familial_insomnia \"Fatal familial\ninsomnia\") is a hereditary [prion](/wiki/Prion \"Prion\") disease in which\ndegeneration of the thalamus occurs, causing the patient to gradually lose his\nability to sleep and progressing to a state of total [insomnia](/wiki/Insomnia\n\"Insomnia\"), which invariably leads to death.

                "Answer Analysis": "The answer provided suggests 'thalamus', which is known for relaying motor and sensory signals to the cerebral cortex.",
                "Document Content Analysis": "The document provides details about various components and functions of neuron anatomy, such as dendrites, axons, synapses, and myelin sheaths, which contribute to neuron signal transmission.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document mentions neurons, axons, dendrites, and synapses, all of which are related to the function of relaying signals.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document does not mention 'thalamus', specifically focusing on structures more directly involved with neurons rather than broader brain structures.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document provides detailed information about neuron structures which play roles in signal transmission, including axons and dendrites, which are relevant to the concept of transmitting signals between neurons and other cells.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not mention the thalamus or explicitly discuss the broader functions of relaying signals beyond basic neuronal structures.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Yes, the document provides context on neuron function, such as axons and synapses facilitating signal passage, which are foundational to understanding signal relaying mechanisms.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "1",
                "Explanation": "The document contains information pertinent to neuron function and signal relay mechanisms but lacks explicit reference to broader brain structures like the thalamus, which was identified as the answer. It is partially relevant as it offers context about how neurons transmit signals, a foundational concept to signal relay across cells."
