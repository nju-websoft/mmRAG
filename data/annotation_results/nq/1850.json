After Haller has an encounter\nwith a fellow psychiatric patient, he is confronted with the possibility that\nthere may be more to him than mental illness.[4]\n\n## Cast and\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast and characters\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Legion characters](/wiki/List_of_Legion_characters\n\"List of Legion characters\")\n\n  * [Dan Stevens](/wiki/Dan_Stevens \"Dan Stevens\") as [David Haller](/wiki/Legion_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Legion \\(Marvel Comics\\)\"): \n\nThe [mutant](/wiki/Mutant_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Mutant \\(Marvel Comics\\)\") son of\n[Charles Xavier](/wiki/Professor_X \"Professor X\"), Haller was diagnosed with\nschizophrenia at a young age and meets the \"girl of his dreams\" in a\npsychiatric hospital.[5][6] The character possesses various\n[psychic](/wiki/Psychic \"Psychic\") abilities, including\n[telepathy](/wiki/Telepathy \"Telepathy\") and [telekinesis](/wiki/Telekinesis\n\"Telekinesis\").[7] Stevens joined the series because of showrunner [Noah\nHawley](/wiki/Noah_Hawley \"Noah Hawley\")'s involvement,[6] and did extensive\nresearch on mental health to prepare for the role, talking to both mentally\nill persons and doctors.[8] Hawley and the cast kept secrets from Stevens\nabout the character and plot so that he could identify with Haller's confusion\nabout himself and reality.[9]\n\n  * [Rachel Keller](/wiki/Rachel_Keller_\\(actress\\) \"Rachel Keller \\(actress\\)\") as Sydney \"Syd\" Barrett: \n\nA young woman who becomes Haller's girlfriend.[5][6] Syd's mind trades places\nwith that of anyone she touches, with hers entering their body, and vice\nversa.[7] Because of her abilities, the character is portrayed as \"withdrawn\",\nthe opposite of Keller's breakout performance in the [second\nseason](/wiki/Fargo_\\(season_2\\) \"Fargo \\(season 2\\)\") of Hawley's\n_[Fargo](/wiki/Fargo_\\(TV_series\\) \"Fargo \\(TV series\\)\")_.[10] She is named\nafter [Roger \"Syd\" Barrett](/wiki/Syd_Barrett \"Syd Barrett\") of the rock band\n[Pink Floyd](/wiki/Pink_Floyd \"Pink Floyd\"), whose music was an important\ninfluence on the series for Hawley.[11]\n\n  * [Aubrey Plaza](/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza \"Aubrey Plaza\") as Lenny Busker: \n\nHaller's friend, an \"impossible optimist\" despite a history of drug and\nalcohol abuse.[5][6] The character dies in the first episode, but returns as\none form of the powerful mutant [Amahl Farouk / Shadow King](/wiki/Shadow_King\n\"Shadow King\"), who appears in Haller's mind using several forms in addition\nto Busker.[12] Busker was originally written for a middle aged man, until\nHawley met Plaza and rethought the character. However, Plaza insisted that the\ncharacter's dialogue not be changed for her, instead choosing to play the\ncharacter as both male and female. This led to Busker \"making crass remarks\nabout women and muttering vintage phrases\".[13]\n\n  * [Bill Irwin](/wiki/Bill_Irwin \"Bill Irwin\") as Cary Loudermilk: \n\nA mutant scientist,[14][6][15] one of the founders of Summerland and one of\nBird's specialists.[16] The character is introduced in the second episode, but\nHawley sought to cast Irwin, for his \"playful approach to characters\", during\nfilming on the pilot, before the character's role had been written.[17][6]\nHawley \"had to pitch him the weird, crazy character dynamic and that the show\nis about memory and identity\", and Irwin agreed to join the project.[18]\n\n  * Jeremie Harris as Ptonomy Wallace: \n\nA former child prodigy,[19][6] one of Bird's specialists.[16] A \"memory\nartist\", Ptonomy \"remembers everything, and has the ability to take people\nback into their own memories\".[7]\n\n  * [Amber Midthunder](/wiki/Amber_Midthunder \"Amber Midthunder\") as Kerry Loudermilk: \n\nA [savant](/wiki/Savant_syndrome \"Savant syndrome\") who lives inside Cary's\nbody; their mutant power allows them to coexist in one body or to become\nseparate physical persons.[20][6] Kerry only ages when she is outside Cary,\nleaving her physically much younger than he is.\n\n  * [Katie Aselton](/wiki/Katie_Aselton \"Katie Aselton\") as Amy Haller: \n\nDavid's older sister, who tries to remain positive despite his history of\nmental illness.[21][6] Hawley said that she defined herself as normal \"against\nher brother. She finds herself being looked at as if she might be crazy, as\nwell.\"[15]\n\n  * [Jean Smart](/wiki/Jean_Smart \"Jean Smart\") as Melanie Bird: \n\nA demanding psychiatric therapist.[5][16] Smart joined the series immediately\nwhen asked by Hawley, despite knowing nothing about the show and its source\nmaterial, due to her previous [Emmy](/wiki/Emmy \"Emmy\")-nominated work with\nhim on the second season of _Fargo_.[22]\n\n##\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\n### Season 1\n(2017)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Season 1 \\(2017\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Legion (season 1)](/wiki/Legion_\\(season_1\\) \"Legion \\(season\n1\\)\")\n\nNo. | Title | Directed by | Written by | Original air date | Prod.  \ncode | U.S. viewers  \n(millions)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | \"[Chapter 1](/wiki/Chapter_1_\\(Legion\\) \"Chapter 1 \\(Legion\\)\")\" | [Noah Hawley](/wiki/Noah_Hawley \"Noah Hawley\") | Noah Hawley | February 8, 2017 (2017-02-08) | XLN01001 | 1.62[23]  \n2 | \"Chapter 2\" | [Michael Uppendahl](/wiki/Michael_Uppendahl \"Michael Uppendahl\") | Noah Hawley | February 15, 2017 (2017-02-15) | XLN01002 | 1.13[24]  \n3 | \"Chapter 3\" | Michael Uppendahl | Peter Calloway | February 22, 2017 (2017-02-22) | XLN01003 | 1.04[25]  \n4 | \"Chapter 4\" | [Larysa Kondracki](/wiki/Larysa_Kondracki \"Larysa Kondracki\") | Nathaniel Halpern | March 1, 2017 (2017-03-01) | XLN01004 | 0.75[26]  \n5 | \"Chapter 5\" | Tim Mielants | Peter Calloway | March 8, 2017 (2017-03-08) | XLN01005 | 0.80[27]  \n6 | \"Chapter 6\" | [Hiro Murai](/wiki/Hiro_Murai \"Hiro Murai\") | Nathaniel Halpern | March 15, 2017 (2017-03-15) | XLN01006 | 0.73[28]  \n7 | \"Chapter 7\" | [Dennie Gordon](/wiki/Dennie_Gordon \"Dennie Gordon\") | Jennifer Yale | March 22, 2017 (2017-03-22) | XLN01007 | 0.72[29]  \n8 | \"Chapter 8\" | Michael Uppendahl | Noah Hawley | March 29, 2017 (2017-03-29) | XLN01008 | 0.81[30]  \n  \n### Season\n2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Season 2\")]\n\nFX renewed _Legion_ for a second season on March 15, 2017.[31] At the end of\nthat month, Hawley explained that he planned for the season to have ten\nepisodes, and to focus more on the series' other characters in addition to\nDavid Haller.[32] Filming is set to begin in July 2017,[33] with the season\nexpected to begin airing in February 2018.[32]\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nSee also: [Production of season 1](/wiki/Legion_\\(season_1\\)#Production\n\"Legion \\(season 1\\)\")\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Noah_Hawley_%2815042030244%29.jpg/170px-\nNoah_Hawley_%2815042030244%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Noah_Hawley_\\(15042030244\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Noah_Hawley_\\(15042030244\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCreator Noah Hawley set out to create a fresh take on the [superhero\ngenre](/wiki/Superhero_fiction \"Superhero fiction\").\n\nAfter completing work on the [first season](/wiki/Fargo_\\(season_1\\) \"Fargo\n\\(season 1\\)\") of _[Fargo](/wiki/Fargo_\\(TV_series\\) \"Fargo \\(TV series\\)\")_\nat [FX](/wiki/FX_\\(TV_channel\\) \"FX \\(TV channel\\)\") in 2014, [Noah\nHawley](/wiki/Noah_Hawley \"Noah Hawley\") was presented with the opportunity to\ndevelop the first live-action television series based on the\n[X-Men](/wiki/X-Men \"X-Men\") comics, of which Hawley was a fan when growing\nup.[34] Hawley was initially pitched two different ideas for the potential\nseries,[10] including an adaptation of the comics' [Hellfire\nClub](/wiki/Hellfire_Club_\\(comics\\) \"Hellfire Club \\(comics\\)\"), but the\nideas did not interest Hawley. Instead, he worked with [_X-Men_ film\nseries](/wiki/X-Men_\\(film_series\\) \"X-Men \\(film series\\)\") writer and\nproducer [Simon Kinberg](/wiki/Simon_Kinberg \"Simon Kinberg\") to reverse-\nengineer an idea for the series. After discussing an \"interesting show in this\ngenre ... that isn't being done\", the two settled on the character of [David\nHaller / Legion](/wiki/Legion_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Legion \\(Marvel Comics\\)\").\nHawley found the character interesting because of his mental illness, and for\nthe potential of the series to depict his unique mindset.[34] He pitched the\nseries as \"a deconstruction of a villain ... and a love story\".[10]\n\nIn October 2015, FX ordered a [pilot](/wiki/Television_pilot \"Television\npilot\") for _Legion_ , with [Marvel Television](/wiki/Marvel_Television\n\"Marvel Television\") and [FX Productions](/wiki/Fox_Entertainment_Group \"Fox\nEntertainment Group\") producing; FX Productions would handle the physical\nproduction. Hawley was set to write the pilot, and executive produce the\nseries alongside _X-Men_ film producers [Lauren Shuler\nDonner](/wiki/Lauren_Shuler_Donner \"Lauren Shuler Donner\"), [Bryan\nSinger](/wiki/Bryan_Singer \"Bryan Singer\"), and Kinberg, Marvel Television\nexecutives [Jeph Loeb](/wiki/Jeph_Loeb \"Jeph Loeb\") and Jim Chory, and\nHawley's _Fargo_ collaborator John Cameron.[4] Steve Blackman, [Alan\nFine](/wiki/Alan_Fine_\\(executive\\) \"Alan Fine \\(executive\\)\"), [Stan\nLee](/wiki/Stan_Lee \"Stan Lee\"), [Joe Quesada](/wiki/Joe_Quesada \"Joe\nQuesada\"), and Karim Zreik also executive produce.[35] Hawley's initial script\nfor the series was described as \"less fractured\", \"cohesive [and] much more\nregular.\" However, he quickly reconceived the series \"and decided more\n_[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless\nMind](/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind \"Eternal Sunshine of the\nSpotless Mind\")_ , [Terrence Malick](/wiki/Terrence_Malick \"Terrence Malick\"),\nmore whimsy, more impressionistic and went in that direction.\"[10] By January\n2016, FX President [John Landgraf](/wiki/John_Landgraf \"John Landgraf\") was\nconfident that the series would be picked up by the network, saying that \"the\nvast majority of things that we pilot do go forward to series\" and \"the\nscripts [for _Legion_] are extraordinary.\"[36] That May, FX ordered an eight-\nepisode first season of _Legion_.[14]\n\nIn June, Landgraf said that the series, if successful, could run for as many\nseasons as Hawley feels it needs to tell the story.[37] Discussing future\nseasons, Hawley said in January 2017 that he was open to continuing the story\npast the first season, but didn't want the audience to get to the end of the\nfirst run and have \"no resolution of any kind at the end of it.\" Star [Dan\nStevens](/wiki/Dan_Stevens \"Dan Stevens\") said, \"I know for a fact that there\nare more issues that David has to deal with than the one that we really\naddress in the first season.\"[8] Also at that time, Singer explained the\nexecutive producers' roles in the series, saying that he, Donner, and Kinberg\nbrought their experience from making the _X-Men_ films, but their involvement\ngenerally consisted of giving small notes on scripts and early cuts of\nepisodes.[38] In March, FX ordered a second season of the series.[31] With the\nend of the first season, Hawley said that the second season would consist of\nten episodes, and explained that he was unsure at that time how long he would\nlike the series to run: \"I think there were things about the first season that\n[I felt] would unfold faster than they did, and things that I thought would\ntake longer that I dealt with more quickly. I think by the end of the second\nyear I’ll have a better sense of how many more years there are to go\".[32]\n\n###\nWriting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Writing\")]\n\nKinberg teased in November 2015 that the series would tell \"X-Men stories in a\nslightly different way and even with a slightly different tone\" from the\nfilms, noting the differences in tone between the \"operatic\" _X-Men_ films and\nthe \"irreverent and hysterical\" _[Deadpool](/wiki/Deadpool_\\(film\\) \"Deadpool\n\\(film\\)\")_ , and feeling that _Legion_ gives \"us an opportunity to go even\nfurther ... in some ways to sort of blow up the paradigm of comic book or\nsuperhero stories and almost do our _[Breaking Bad](/wiki/Breaking_Bad\n\"Breaking Bad\")_ of superhero stories.\"[39] Loeb noted that \"the core\" of all\n_X-Men_ comic books has always been that \"the X-Men were different ... We live\nin a world right now where diversity and uniqueness and whether or not we fit\nin is something that's on our minds twenty-four hours a day. The X-Men have\nnever been more relevant than they are right now.\" Hawley added, \"The great\nthing about exploring this character is before he has an opinion about anyone\nelse, he has to figure out his own shit. That's what we all have to do. This\njourney isn't necessarily racing toward a battle with an entity, so much as\nembracing the battle within.\"[6]\n\nIn May 2016, Hawley described his take on the series as being inspired by the\nworks of [David Lynch](/wiki/David_Lynch \"David Lynch\"), and said that \"the\nstructure of a story should reflect the content of the story. If the story, as\nin this case, is about a guy who is either schizophrenic or he has these\nabilities, i.e., he doesn’t know what’s real and what’s not real, then the\naudience should have the same experience ... my goal with this is to do\nsomething whimsical and imaginative and unexpected. Not just because I want to\ndo something different, but because it feels like the right way to tell this\nstory.\"[40] Elaborating on structuring the series to reflect Haller's point of\nview, Hawley said, \"I love the idea that even when you're in it on the\njourney, there is this _[Alice in Wonderland](/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland \"Alice\nin Wonderland\")_ quality to it, of a story within a story.\"[34] Discussing the\nincreasing popularity of [unreliable narrators](/wiki/Unreliable_narrators\n\"Unreliable narrators\") in television, Hawley said that he wanted to avoid\nmaking the audience think that the series is a puzzle that needs to be solved\nby solving the mysteries for them upfront—\"We’re going to take a character out\nof confusion into clarity and an audience out of mystery into clarity.\"[17]\nHawley deliberately chose not to directly adapt any storylines from the\ncomics, feeling that \"you're bound to offend somebody, no matter what you do\"\nin that situation. Instead, he wanted to take the character of Legion and\nbasic set-up around him, and \"play\" with that,[34] which he described in\nrelation to _Fargo_ —\"my job was not to remake [the\nmovie](/wiki/Fargo_\\(film\\) \"Fargo \\(film\\)\"), to sort of retell a story that\nhad already been told, but to try to tell a different story with the same\neffect, the same impact.\"[41]\n\nConcerning the mental illness aspects of the character, Hawley said, \"It’s a\ntragic condition that people have, and so I don’t want to use it for\nentertainment purposes ... if we can ground that [aspect] for the audience,\nthen the idea that he’s fallen in love and that he’s not ill, there’s a hope\nto that that the audience is gonna grab onto.\"[41] In January 2017, Hawley\nexplained that he was willing to use different tropes from the superhero genre\nin the series, such as superhero costumes with capes, if necessary, but did\nwant to avoid \"sending a message that all conflict can only be resolved\nthrough battle. There is a sense in a lot of these stories that everything\nalways builds to a big fight ... I wanted to find a story that was just as\nexciting and interesting but doesn’t send the message that in the end that\n'might makes right'.\"[7] At the end of the first season, Hawley said, \"I like\nthis idea of having to face our demons\", with the first season seeing Haller\ngo through an internal struggle with the malevolent [Shadow\nKing](/wiki/Shadow_King \"Shadow King\") occupying his mind, and then the second\nseason seeing that character possess someone else \"making it an exterior\nagent. And there’s going to be something very complicated about going to war\nwith himself. It’s been with him since he was a baby, it’s like a [phantom\nlimb](/wiki/Phantom_limb \"Phantom limb\") now, it’s part of him.\" Hawley said\nhe preferred this idea of a villain \"worthy of creating a whole story around\",\nrather than a villain-of-the year. He was unsure at the time how long that\nstoryline would continue throughout the show, but said \"it’s a fascinating\nsetup to follow.\"[32]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\nIn January 2016, [Rachel Keller](/wiki/Rachel_Keller_\\(actress\\) \"Rachel\nKeller \\(actress\\)\") was cast as the female lead of the series, after her\nbreakout role in _Fargo_.[42] In early February, Stevens, [Aubrey\nPlaza](/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza \"Aubrey Plaza\"), and [Jean Smart](/wiki/Jean_Smart\n\"Jean Smart\") were cast as Haller, his friend Lenny Busker, and therapist\nMelanie Bird, respectively. Keller's role was revealed to be Syd\nBarrett.[5][6][16] Later that month, Jeremie Harris was cast in the regular\nrole of Ptonomy Wallace,[19] and [Amber Midthunder](/wiki/Amber_Midthunder\n\"Amber Midthunder\") was cast as the [savant](/wiki/Savant_syndrome \"Savant\nsyndrome\") Kerry Loudermilk.[20][6] In March, [Katie\nAselton](/wiki/Katie_Aselton \"Katie Aselton\") was cast as Haller's older\nsister Amy.[21] With the full series order in May 2016, [Bill\nIrwin](/wiki/Bill_Irwin \"Bill Irwin\") was added to the cast,[14] in the role\nof Cary Loudermilk.[6]\n\n###\nDesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Thursday_Comic-\nCon_2017_%2835259629313%29.jpg/220px-Thursday_Comic-\nCon_2017_%2835259629313%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Thursday_Comic-\nCon_2017_\\(35259629313\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Thursday_Comic-Con_2017_\\(35259629313\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn advertisement for the series at [San Diego Comic-\nCon](/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con \"San Diego Comic-Con\") 2017\n\nThough he put little thought into the aesthetics of the series when writing\nthe pilot,[43] as a director Hawley wanted the series to be highly stylized,\ndescribing his vision for it as \"a 1964 [Terence Stamp](/wiki/Terence_Stamp\n\"Terence Stamp\") movie\".[44] It was not feasible to literally translate [Bill\nSienkiewicz](/wiki/Bill_Sienkiewicz \"Bill Sienkiewicz\")'s iconic artwork of\nthe character to the screen, and Hawley wanted the series to have \"its own\nvisual aesthetic to it, and part of that is being a story kind of out of time\nand out of place\". He stated that \"the design of a show has to have its own\ninternal logic\", and compared this sensibility to the series\n_[Hannibal](/wiki/Hannibal_\\(TV_series\\) \"Hannibal \\(TV series\\)\")_ , which he\nsaid was \"a great example of something that had this almost fetishistic beauty\nto everything that you saw, whether it was food or violence.\"[41] Hawley\nelaborated that the design choice of 60s British films came about because\n\"this whole show is not the world, it’s David’s _experience_ of the world.\nHe’s piecing his world together from nostalgia and memory and the world\nbecomes that.\"[7]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\nFilming for the pilot took place in [Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver\n\"Vancouver\"),[45] with Hawley directing and [Dana\nGonzales](/wiki/Dana_Gonzales \"Dana Gonzales\") serving as\ncinematographer.[40][46] With the series order, the rest of the first season\nwere set to also film in Vancouver,[14][47] with Craig Wrobleski also working\nas a cinematographer. Both Ganzales and Wrobleski previously worked with\nHawley on _Fargo_.[48] The pilot featured a large amount of in-camera effects,\nwhich Hawley admitted would be a challenge for the series' directors to\nmaintain,[18] given he had 21 days to film the pilot, but the subsequent\nepisodes were only scheduled 8 days of filming each. Some of these shoots\nultimately had to be extended to 10 or 11 days filming to meet Hawley's\nvision.[17] For the second season, the series relocated its production to\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\") to take advantage of tax\nincentives provided by the [California Film\nCommission](/wiki/California_Film_Commission \"California Film Commission\")\nunder its \"Program 2.0\" initiative.[49]\n\n###\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\n[Jeff Russo](/wiki/Jeff_Russo \"Jeff Russo\") was revealed to be composing the\nseries' score in October 2016.[11] Hawley stated that when first meeting with\nRusso about the series, he told the latter that he wanted the series to sound\nlike [Pink Floyd](/wiki/Pink_Floyd \"Pink Floyd\")'s _[The Dark Side of the\nMoon](/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon \"The Dark Side of the Moon\")_ ,\nexplaining \"that album more than anything is really the soundscape of mental\nillness to some degree\".[44][11] Russo felt that \"the important part is\nallowing the humanity of these characters to really shine through\", and in\naddition to an orchestra he used \"a bunch of old synthesizers\" and \"a lot of\ninteresting sound design\" to represent the \"otherworldly\" elements of the\nseries.[50] With the series' premiere, Russo reiterated that the \"through-\nline\" of the series is the relationship between Haller and Barrett, and said\nthat a love story \"lends itself to musical moments. It allows it to underscore\nthe character.\" After his early meetings with Hawley, Russo developed some\ninitial ideas for the score, and created three different themes to represent\nHaller. He adapted these ideas to fit the episodes once they had been\nedited.[51] A soundtrack album for the [first\nseason](/wiki/Legion_\\(season_1\\) \"Legion \\(season 1\\)\") was released\ndigitally on February 24, 2017, on [Amazon.com](/wiki/Amazon.com\n\"Amazon.com\").[52]\n\n### Shared universe\nconnections[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Shared universe connections\")]\n\nLandgraf stated, in January 2016, that the series would be set in a [universe\nparallel](/wiki/Parallel_universe_\\(fiction\\) \"Parallel universe \\(fiction\\)\")\nto the _X-Men_ films where \"the US government is in the early days of being\naware that something called mutants exist but the public is not\". He felt it\nwas unlikely that characters would cross over between the show and films, but\nnoted that this could change between then and the premiere of the series.[36]\nThat July, an article on [Marvel.com](/wiki/Marvel_Entertainment \"Marvel\nEntertainment\") referred to Legion as one of several characters joining the\n[Marvel Cinematic Universe](/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe \"Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse\") (MCU), suggesting that _Legion_ would be set in that [shared\nuniverse](/wiki/Shared_universe \"Shared universe\") like Marvel Television's\nother series.[53] The next month, Singer said that _Legion_ had actually been\ndesigned to fit into the _X-Men_ universe, but also to stand alone, so \"you\nwouldn't have to label\" the relationship between the series and the films. He\nteased plans to have the series \"relate to future _X-Men_ movies\".[54]\n\nAt [New York Comic-Con](/wiki/New_York_Comic-Con \"New York Comic-Con\") 2016,\nDonner said that the series is \"far from the _X-Men_ movies, but still lives\nin that universe. The only way for _X-Men_ to keep moving forward is to be\noriginal and to surprise. And this is a surprise. It is very, very different.\"\nHawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's\n\"subjective reality\", it would not have to address any connections to the\nfilms straight away, noting that _Fargo_ , which is connected to the 1996 film\nof the same name, at first \"had to stand on its own feet\" before exploring\nthose connections more; \"We have to earn the right to be part of this\nuniverse. My hope is we create something so strong that the people in the\nmovie studio call and say they would be foolish enough not to connect these\nthings.\" He did state that \"you can't tell this story without\" acknowledging\nthat Legion is the son of [Charles Xavier](/wiki/Professor_X \"Professor X\"),\nwho appears in the films. In regards to the MCU, Loeb stated that his\ninvolvement in the series was a sign that \"bridges are being made\" between\nMarvel and Fox, \"but I don't want to make any promises ... Marvel heroes at\ntheir core are people who are damaged and are trying to figure out who they\nare in life. It doesn't matter whether or not they're X-Men, [Tony\nStark](/wiki/Iron_Man \"Iron Man\"), [Matt\nMurdock](/wiki/Daredevil_\\(Marvel_Comics_character\\) \"Daredevil \\(Marvel\nComics character\\)\") or [Peter Parker](/wiki/Spider-Man \"Spider-Man\") ... If\nyou start at a place as strong as David's character is and you have a\nstoryteller like Noah, then it's Marvel. In that way, it _is_ all\nconnected.\"[6]\n\nLoeb and Donner stated in January 2017 that there were no plans to have\n_Legion_ be the first in a series of connected shows on FX, like Marvel\nTelevision's group of interconnected\n_[Defenders](/wiki/The_Defenders_\\(miniseries\\) \"The Defenders\n\\(miniseries\\)\")_ series on [Netflix](/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\"),[55] and that\n_Legion_ and the _X-Men_ series being developed for\n[Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting Company\") are \"not\ngoing to get in each other's way.\"[10] Donner stated that the series was just\na chance to bring an X-Men character to the screen who was not going to be\nused by the films. The producers hoped that audiences would watch the show\nbecause of its character-focus and the talents of Hawley and the cast, rather\nthan to \"see a Marvel franchise show.\"[55] Donner also noted that having\nHawley focus on Haller's perspective of reality rather than connections to the\n_X-Men_ films allowed the series to avoid the convoluted continuity of the\nfilms, \"because we play with so many different timelines, and we rebooted and\nnot really rebooted and all that\" throughout the films. Therefore, \"the\ncinematic universe will not worry about _Legion_. They will not worry about\nthese TV worlds at all. They will just continue in the way that they have been\ncontinuing.\"[10] For the onscreen confirmation that Xavier is Haller's father\nin \"[Chapter 7](/wiki/Chapter_7_\\(Legion\\) \"Chapter 7 \\(Legion\\)\")\", with\nXavier's signature wheelchair shown in a brief flashback, the series'\nproduction was able to choose from any of the variant wheelchairs used\nthroughout the film series. They settled on the version from _[X-Men:\nApocalypse](/wiki/X-Men:_Apocalypse \"X-Men: Apocalypse\")_ , with the prop used\nin that film being brought out of storage for the show.[12][22]\n\n##\nRelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Release\")]\n\nSeason | Episodes | Originally aired | [DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") and [Blu-ray](/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc \"Blu-ray Disc\") release dates  \n---|---|---|---  \nFirst aired | Last aired | [Region 1](/wiki/DVD_region_code#1 \"DVD region code\") | [Region 2](/wiki/DVD_region_code#2 \"DVD region code\") | [Region 4](/wiki/DVD_region_code#4 \"DVD region code\")  \n| [1](/wiki/Legion_\\(season_1\\)#Release \"Legion \\(season 1\\)\") | 8 | February 8, 2017 | March 29, 2017 | TBA | October 2, 2017[56] | TBA  \n| 2 | 10[32] | February 2018[32] | TBA | TBA | TBA | TBA  \n  \n###\nBroadcast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Broadcast\")]\n\n_Legion_ airs on FX in the United States,[16] while Fox channels in over 125\ncountries have picked up their respective airing rights for the series,\nreleasing the show using a \"day-and-date\" delivery system so that viewers\naround the world get the series on the same day as the U.S. Fox Networks\nGroup's sales division handle distribution of the series to third parties.[57]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Legion_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nSeason | [Nielsen ratings](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings \"Nielsen ratings\") | Critical response  \n---|---|---  \nPremiere total viewers  \n(in millions) | Finale total viewers  \n(in millions) | Season average total viewers,  \ninc.
