It began in 2003 with the launch of the two\n[rovers](/wiki/Rover_\\(space_exploration\\) \"Rover \\(space exploration\\)\"):\nMER-A _[Spirit](/wiki/Spirit_\\(rover\\) \"Spirit \\(rover\\)\")_ and MER-B\n_[Opportunity](/wiki/Opportunity_\\(rover\\) \"Opportunity \\(rover\\)\")_ —to\nexplore the Martian surface and [geology](/wiki/Geology_of_Mars \"Geology of\nMars\"); both landed on Mars at separate locations in January 2004. Both rovers\nfar outlived their planned missions of 90 [Martian solar\ndays](/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Sols \"Timekeeping on Mars\"): MER-A\n_[Spirit](/wiki/Spirit_\\(rover\\) \"Spirit \\(rover\\)\")_ was active until 2010,\nwhile MER-B _[Opportunity](/wiki/Opportunity_\\(rover\\) \"Opportunity\n\\(rover\\)\")_ is still active in 2018, and holds the record for the longest\ndistance driven by any off-Earth wheeled vehicle.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Objectives\n  * 2 History\n  * 3 Spacecraft design\n    * 3.1 Cruise stage\n      * 3.1.1 Navigation\n      * 3.1.2 Communication\n    * 3.2 Aeroshell\n      * 3.2.1 Parts\n      * 3.2.2 Composition\n    * 3.3 Parachute\n      * 3.3.1 Design\n      * 3.3.2 Composition\n      * 3.3.3 Connected systems\n    * 3.4 Airbags\n    * 3.5 Lander\n      * 3.5.1 Uprighting\n      * 3.5.2 Moving the payload onto Mars\n  * 4 Rover design\n    * 4.1 Drive system\n    * 4.2 Power and electronic systems\n    * 4.3 Communication\n    * 4.4 Scientific instrumentation\n  * 5 Naming of _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_\n  * 6 Test rovers\n  * 7 SAP\n  * 8 Planetary science findings\n    * 8.1 _Spirit_ Landing Site, Gusev Crater\n      * 8.1.1 Plains\n      * 8.1.2 Dust\n      * 8.1.3 Columbia Hills\n    * 8.2 _Opportunity_ Landing Site, Meridiani Planum\n  * 9 Landing locations\n  * 10 Glossary\n  * 11 See also\n  * 12 Notes\n  * 13 References\n  * 14 Further reading\n  * 15 External links\n\n##\nObjectives[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Objectives\")]\n\nThe mission's scientific objective was to search for and characterize a wide\nrange of [rocks](/wiki/Rock_\\(geology\\) \"Rock \\(geology\\)\") and\n[soils](/wiki/Soil \"Soil\") that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. The\nmission is part of NASA's [Mars Exploration\nProgram](/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Program \"Mars Exploration Program\"), which\nincludes three previous successful landers: the two [Viking\nprogram](/wiki/Viking_program \"Viking program\") landers in 1976 and [Mars\nPathfinder](/wiki/Mars_Pathfinder \"Mars Pathfinder\") probe in 1997.[3]\n\nThe total cost of building, launching, landing and operating the rovers on the\nsurface for the initial 90-[sol](/wiki/Martian_day#Sols \"Martian day\") primary\nmission was US$820 million.[4] Since the rovers have continued to function\nbeyond their initial 90 sol primary mission, they have each received five\nmission extensions. The fifth mission extension was granted in October 2007,\nand ran to the end of 2009.[4][5] The total cost of the first four mission\nextensions was $104 million, and the fifth mission extension is expected to\ncost at least $20 million.[4]\n\nIn July 2007, during the fourth mission extension, Martian dust storms blocked\nsunlight to the rovers and threatened the ability of the craft to gather\nenergy through their [solar panels](/wiki/Solar_panel \"Solar panel\"), causing\nengineers to fear that one or both of them might be permanently disabled.\nHowever, the dust storms lifted, allowing them to resume operations.[6]\n\nOn May 1, 2009, during its fifth mission extension, _Spirit_ became stuck in\nsoft soil on Mars.[7] After nearly nine months of attempts to get the rover\nback on track, including using test rovers on Earth, NASA announced on January\n26, 2010 that _Spirit_ was being retasked as a stationary science platform.\nThis mode would enable _Spirit_ to assist scientists in ways that a mobile\nplatform could not, such as detecting \"[wobbles](/wiki/Chandler_wobble\n\"Chandler wobble\")\" in the planet's rotation that would indicate a liquid\ncore.[8] Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) lost contact with Spirit after last\nhearing from the rover on March 22, 2010 and continued attempts to regain\ncommunications lasted until May 25, 2011, bringing the elapsed mission time to\n6 years 2 months 19 days, or over 25 times the original planned mission\nduration.[9]\n\nIn recognition of the vast amount of [scientific\ninformation](/wiki/Scientific_information_from_the_Mars_Exploration_Rover_mission\n\"Scientific information from the Mars Exploration Rover mission\") amassed by\nboth rovers, two [asteroids](/wiki/Asteroid \"Asteroid\") have been named in\ntheir honor: [37452 Spirit](/wiki/37452_Spirit \"37452 Spirit\") and [39382\nOpportunity](/wiki/39382_Opportunity \"39382 Opportunity\"). The mission is\nmanaged for [NASA](/wiki/NASA \"NASA\") by the [Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory](/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory \"Jet Propulsion Laboratory\"),\nwhich designed, built, and is operating the rovers.\n\nOn January 24, 2014, NASA reported that current studies by the remaining\n[rover](/wiki/Mars_rover \"Mars rover\")\n[_Opportunity_](/wiki/Opportunity_\\(rover\\) \"Opportunity \\(rover\\)\") as well\nas by the newer [Mars Science Laboratory](/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory \"Mars\nScience Laboratory\") rover [_Curiosity_](/wiki/Curiosity_\\(rover\\) \"Curiosity\n\\(rover\\)\") will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a\n[biosphere](/wiki/Biosphere \"Biosphere\") based on\n[autotrophic](/wiki/Autotroph \"Autotroph\"), [chemotrophic](/wiki/Chemotroph\n\"Chemotroph\") and/or [chemolithoautotrophic](/wiki/Lithotroph#Chemolithotrophs\n\"Lithotroph\") [microorganisms](/wiki/Microorganism \"Microorganism\"), as well\nas ancient water, including [fluvio-lacustrine\nenvironments](/wiki/Lacustrine_plain \"Lacustrine plain\") ([plains](/wiki/Plain\n\"Plain\") related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been\n[habitable](/wiki/Planetary_habitability \"Planetary\nhabitability\").[10][11][12][13] The search for evidence of\n[habitability](/wiki/Planetary_habitability \"Planetary habitability\"),\n[taphonomy](/wiki/Taphonomy \"Taphonomy\") (related to [fossils](/wiki/Fossils\n\"Fossils\")), and [organic carbon](/wiki/Organic_carbon \"Organic carbon\") on\nthe planet [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\") is now a primary [NASA](/wiki/NASA\n\"NASA\") objective.[10]\n\nThe scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover mission are to:[14]\n\n  * Search for and characterize a variety of rocks and soils that hold clues to past [water](/wiki/Water_on_Mars \"Water on Mars\") activity. In particular, samples sought include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [precipitation](/wiki/Precipitation_\\(meteorology\\) \"Precipitation \\(meteorology\\)\"), [evaporation](/wiki/Water_vapor \"Water vapor\"), [sedimentary cementation](/wiki/Sedimentary_rock \"Sedimentary rock\"), or [hydrothermal activity](/wiki/Hydrothermal_activity \"Hydrothermal activity\").\n  * Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.\n  * Determine what [geologic processes](/wiki/Geology_of_Mars \"Geology of Mars\") have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.\n  * Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter](/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\") instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey Martian geology from orbit.\n  * Search for iron-containing minerals, and to identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\n  * Characterize the [mineralogy](/wiki/Mineralogy \"Mineralogy\") and textures of rocks and soils to determine the processes that created them.\n  * Search for geological clues to the [environmental conditions](/wiki/Environmental_science \"Environmental science\") that existed when liquid water was present.\n  * Assess whether those environments were conducive to [life](/wiki/Life \"Life\").\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Lancement_Spirit_fusee_Delta_IIs_10062003.jpg/145px-\nLancement_Spirit_fusee_Delta_IIs_10062003.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lancement_Spirit_fusee_Delta_IIs_10062003.jpg)\n\nLaunch of MER-A Spirit\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Mer-b-final-\nlaunch.jpg/147px-Mer-b-final-launch.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mer-b-final-launch.jpg)\n\nLaunch of MER-B Opportunity\n\nThe [MER-A](/wiki/Spirit_\\(rover\\) \"Spirit \\(rover\\)\") and\n[MER-B](/wiki/Opportunity_\\(rover\\) \"Opportunity \\(rover\\)\") probes were\nlaunched on June 10, 2003 and July 7, 2003, respectively. Though both probes\nlaunched on [Boeing](/wiki/Boeing \"Boeing\") [Delta II](/wiki/Delta_II \"Delta\nII\") 7925-9.5 rockets from [Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch\nComplex 17](/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_17\n\"Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17\") (CCAFS SLC-17),\nMER-B was on the heavy version of that launch vehicle, needing the extra\nenergy for [Trans-Mars injection](/wiki/Trans-Mars_injection \"Trans-Mars\ninjection\"). The launch vehicles were integrated onto pads right next to each\nother,[15] with MER-A on CCAFS SLC-17A and MER-B on CCAFS SLC-17B. The dual\npads allowed for working the 15- and 21-day planetary launch periods close\ntogether; the last possible launch day for MER-A was June 19, 2003 and the\nfirst day for MER-B was June 25, 2003. [NASA](/wiki/NASA \"NASA\")'s [Launch\nServices Program](/wiki/Launch_Services_Program \"Launch Services Program\")\nmanaged the launch of both spacecraft.\n\nThe probes landed in January 2004 in widely separated equatorial locations on\nMars.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/MER_Timeline_English_2014.png/300px-\nMER_Timeline_English_2014.png)](/wiki/File:MER_Timeline_English_2014.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MER_Timeline_English_2014.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nTimeline of the Mars Exploration mission\n\nOn January 21, 2004, the [Deep Space Network](/wiki/Deep_Space_Network \"Deep\nSpace Network\") lost contact with _Spirit_ , for reasons originally thought to\nbe related to a [thunderstorm](/wiki/Thunderstorm \"Thunderstorm\") over\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"). The rover transmitted a message with\nno data, but later that day missed another communications session with the\n[Mars Global Surveyor](/wiki/Mars_Global_Surveyor \"Mars Global Surveyor\"). The\nnext day, [JPL](/wiki/JPL \"JPL\") received a beep from the rover, indicating\nthat it was in fault mode. On January 23, the flight team succeeded in making\nthe rover send. The fault was believed to have been caused by an error in the\nrover's [flash memory](/wiki/Flash_memory \"Flash memory\") subsystem. The rover\ndid not perform any scientific activities for ten days, while engineers\nupdated its software and ran tests. The problem was corrected by reformatting\n_Spirit '_s flash memory and using a [software patch](/wiki/Software_patch\n\"Software patch\") to avoid memory overload; _Opportunity_ was also upgraded\nwith the patch as a precaution. _Spirit_ returned to full scientific\noperations by February 5.\n\nOn March 23, 2004, a news conference was held announcing \"major discoveries\"\nof evidence of past liquid water on the Martian surface. A delegation of\nscientists showed pictures and data revealing a stratified pattern and [cross\nbedding](/wiki/Cross_bedding \"Cross bedding\") in the rocks of the outcrop\ninside a crater in [Meridiani Planum](/wiki/Meridiani_Planum \"Meridiani\nPlanum\"), landing site of [MER-B, _Opportunity_](/wiki/MER-B \"MER-B\"). This\nsuggested that water once flowed in the region. The irregular distribution of\n[chlorine](/wiki/Chlorine \"Chlorine\") and [bromine](/wiki/Bromine \"Bromine\")\nalso suggests that the place was once the shoreline of a salty sea, now\nevaporated.\n\nOn April 8, 2004, NASA announced that it was extending the mission life of the\nrovers from three to eight months. It immediately provided additional funding\nof US $15 million through September, and $2.8 million per month for continuing\noperations. Later that month, _Opportunity_ arrived at [Endurance\ncrater](/wiki/Endurance_\\(crater\\) \"Endurance \\(crater\\)\"), taking about five\ndays to drive the 200 meters. NASA announced on September 22 that it was\nextending the mission life of the rovers for another six months. _Opportunity_\nwas to leave Endurance crater, visit its discarded heat shield, and proceed to\n[Victoria crater](/wiki/Victoria_\\(crater\\) \"Victoria \\(crater\\)\"). _Spirit_\nwas to attempt to climb to the top of the [Columbia\nHills](/wiki/Columbia_Hills_\\(Mars\\) \"Columbia Hills \\(Mars\\)\").\n\nWith the two rovers still functioning well, NASA later announced another\n18-month extension of the mission to September 2006. _Opportunity_ was to\nvisit the \"Etched Terrain\" and _Spirit_ was to climb a rocky slope toward the\ntop of [Husband Hill](/wiki/Husband_Hill \"Husband Hill\"). On August 21, 2005,\n_Spirit_ reached the summit of Husband Hill after 581\n[sols](/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Sols \"Timekeeping on Mars\") and a journey of\n4.81 kilometers (2.99 mi).\n\n_Spirit_ celebrated its one Martian year anniversary (669 sols or 687 Earth\ndays) on November 20, 2005. _Opportunity_ celebrated its anniversary on\nDecember 12, 2005. At the beginning of the mission, it was expected that the\nrovers would not survive much longer than 90 Martian days. The Columbia Hills\nwere \"just a dream\", according to rover driver Chris Leger. _Spirit_ explored\nthe semicircular rock formation known as [Home\nPlate](/wiki/Home_Plate_\\(Mars\\) \"Home Plate \\(Mars\\)\"). It is a layered rock\noutcrop that puzzles and excites scientists.[16] It is thought that its rocks\nare explosive volcanic deposits, though other possibilities exist, including\nimpact deposits or sediment borne by wind or water.\n\n_Spirit 's_ front right wheel ceased working on March 13, 2006, while the\nrover was moving itself to [McCool Hill](/wiki/McCool_Hill \"McCool Hill\"). Its\ndrivers attempted to drag the dead wheel behind Spirit, but this only worked\nuntil reaching an impassable sandy area on the lower slopes. Drivers directed\n_Spirit_ to a smaller sloped feature, dubbed \"Low Ridge Haven\", where it spent\nthe long Martian winter, waiting for spring and increased solar power levels\nsuitable for driving. That September, _Opportunity_ reached the rim of\n[Victoria crater](/wiki/Victoria_crater \"Victoria crater\"), and Spaceflight\nNow reported that NASA had extended mission for the two rovers through\nSeptember 2007.[17][18] On February 6, 2007, _Opportunity_ became the first\nspacecraft to traverse ten kilometers (6.2 miles) on the surface of Mars.[19]\n\n_Opportunity_ was poised to enter Victoria Crater from its perch on the rim of\nDuck Bay on June 28, 2007,[20] but due to extensive dust storms, it was\ndelayed until the dust had cleared and power returned to safe levels.[21] Two\nmonths later, _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_ resumed driving after hunkering down\nduring raging dust storms that limited solar power to a level that nearly\ncaused the permanent failure of both rovers.[22]\n\nOn October 1, 2007,[23] both _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_ entered their fifth\nmission extension that extended operations into 2009,[24] allowing the rovers\nto have spent five years exploring the Martian surface, pending their\ncontinued survival.\n\nOn August 26, 2008, _Opportunity_ began its three-day climb out of Victoria\ncrater amidst concerns that power spikes, similar to those seen on _Spirit_\nbefore the failure of its right-front wheel, might prevent it from ever being\nable to leave the crater if a wheel failed. Project scientist Bruce Banerdt\nalso said, \"We've done everything we entered Victoria Crater to do and more.\"\n_Opportunity_ will return to the plains in order to characterize Meridiani\nPlanum's vast diversity of rocks—some of which may have been blasted out of\ncraters such as Victoria. The rover had been exploring Victoria Crater since\nSeptember 11, 2007.[25][26] As of January 2009, the two rovers had\ncollectively sent back 250,000 images and traveled over 21 kilometers (13\nmi).[27]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Driving_Distances_on_Mars_and_the_Moon.png/250px-\nDriving_Distances_on_Mars_and_the_Moon.png)](/wiki/File:Driving_Distances_on_Mars_and_the_Moon.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Driving_Distances_on_Mars_and_the_Moon.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nComparison of distances driven by various wheeled vehicles on the surface of\nEarth's [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\") and [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\") (July 28,\n2014).\n\nAfter driving about 3.2 kilometers (2.0 mi) since it left Victoria crater,\n_Opportunity_ first saw the rim of [Endeavour\ncrater](/wiki/Endeavour_\\(crater\\) \"Endeavour \\(crater\\)\") on March 7,\n2009.[28][29] It passed the 16 km (9.9 mi) mark along the way on sol 1897.[30]\nMeanwhile, at Gusev crater, _Spirit_ was dug in deep into the Martian sand,\nmuch as _Opportunity_ was at [Purgatory\nDune](/wiki/Opportunity_rover#Trouble_with_sand_trap \"Opportunity rover\") in\n2005.[31]\n\nOn January 3 and January 24, 2010, _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_ marked six years\non Mars, respectively.[32] On January 26, NASA announced that _Spirit_ will be\nused as a stationary research platform after several months of unsuccessful\nattempts to free the rover from soft sand.[33]\n\nNASA announced on March 24, 2010, that _Opportunity_ , which has an estimated\nremaining drive distance of 12 km to Endeavour Crater, has traveled over 20 km\nsince the start of its mission.[34] Each rover was designed with a mission\ndriving distance goal of just 600 meters.[34] One week later, they announced\nthat _Spirit_ may have gone into hibernation for the Martian winter and might\nnot wake up again for months.[35]\n\nOn September 8, 2010, it was announced that _Opportunity_ had reached the\nhalfway point of the 19-kilometer journey between Victoria crater and\nEndeavour crater.[36]\n\nOn May 22, 2011, NASA announced that it will cease attempts to contact\n_Spirit_ , which has been stuck in a sand trap for two years. The last\nsuccessful communication with the rover was on March 22, 2010. The final\ntransmission to the rover was on May 25, 2011.[37]\n\nIn April 2013, a photo sent back by one of the rovers became widely circulated\non social networking and news sites such as [Reddit](/wiki/Reddit \"Reddit\")\nthat appeared to depict a [human penis](/wiki/Human_penis \"Human penis\")\ncarved into the Martian dirt.[38][39]\n\nOn May 16, 2013, NASA announced that _Opportunity_ had driven further than any\nother NASA vehicle on a world other than Earth.[40] After _Opportunity 's_\ntotal odometry went over 35.744 km (22.210 mi), the rover surpassed the total\ndistance driven by the [Apollo 17](/wiki/Apollo_17 \"Apollo 17\") [Lunar Roving\nVehicle](/wiki/Lunar_Roving_Vehicle \"Lunar Roving Vehicle\").[40]\n\nOn July 28, 2014, NASA announced that _Opportunity_ had driven further than\nany other vehicle on a world other than Earth.[40][41][42] _Opportunity_\ncovered over 40 km (25 mi), surpassing the total distance of 39 km (24 mi)\ndriven by the [Lunokhod 2](/wiki/Lunokhod_2 \"Lunokhod 2\") [lunar\nrover](/wiki/Lunar_rover \"Lunar rover\"), the previous record-holder.[40][41]\n\nOn March 23, 2015, NASA announced that _Opportunity_ had driven the full 42.2\nkm (26.2 mi) distance of a marathon, with a finish time of roughly 11 years, 2\nmonths.[43]\n\n## Spacecraft\ndesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Spacecraft design\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Fusee_Delta_II_lancement_rover_Mars.jpg/220px-\nFusee_Delta_II_lancement_rover_Mars.jpg)](/wiki/File:Fusee_Delta_II_lancement_rover_Mars.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Fusee_Delta_II_lancement_rover_Mars.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMER launch configuration, break apart illustration\n\nThe Mars Exploration Rover was designed to be stowed in the nose of a [Delta\nII rocket](/wiki/Delta_II_rocket \"Delta II rocket\").

It is very similar to the Mars Pathfinder in design and is\napproximately 2.65 [meters](/wiki/Metre \"Metre\") (8.7 ft) in\n[diameter](/wiki/Diameter \"Diameter\") and 1.6 m (5.2 ft) tall, including the\nentry vehicle (see below).\n\nThe primary structure is aluminium with an outer ring of ribs covered by the\n[solar panels](/wiki/Photovoltaic_module \"Photovoltaic module\"), which are\nabout 2.65 m (8.7 ft) in diameter. Divided into five sections, the solar\narrays can provide up to 600 [watts](/wiki/Watt \"Watt\") of power near Earth\nand 300 W at Mars.\n\nHeaters and [multi-layer insulation](/wiki/Multi-layer_insulation \"Multi-layer\ninsulation\") keep the electronics \"warm\". A [freon](/wiki/Freon \"Freon\")\nsystem removes heat from the flight computer and communications hardware\ninside the rover so they do not overheat. Cruise avionics systems allow the\nflight computer to interface with other electronics, such as the sun sensors,\nstar scanner and heaters.\n\n####\nNavigation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Navigation\")]\n\nThe star scanner (without a backup system) and [sun sensor](/wiki/Sun_sensor\n\"Sun sensor\") allowed the spacecraft to know its orientation in space by\nanalyzing the position of the Sun and other stars in relation to itself.\nSometimes the craft could be slightly off course; this was expected, given the\n500-million-kilometer (320 million mile) journey. Thus navigators planned up\nto six trajectory correction maneuvers, along with health checks.\n\nTo ensure the spacecraft arrived at Mars in the right place for its landing,\ntwo light-weight, aluminium-lined tanks carried about 31 kg (about 68 lb) of\n[hydrazine](/wiki/Hydrazine \"Hydrazine\") [propellant](/wiki/Propellant\n\"Propellant\"). Along with cruise guidance and control systems, the propellant\nallowed navigators to keep the spacecraft on course. Burns and pulse firings\nof the propellant allowed three types of maneuvers:\n\n  * An axial burn uses pairs of thrusters to change spacecraft velocity;\n  * A lateral burn uses two \"thruster clusters\" (four thrusters per cluster) to move the spacecraft \"sideways\" through seconds-long pulses;\n  * Pulse mode firing uses coupled thruster pairs for spacecraft [precession](/wiki/Precession \"Precession\") maneuvers (turns).\n\n####\nCommunication[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Communication\")]\n\nThe spacecraft used a high-frequency [X band](/wiki/X_band \"X band\")\n[radio](/wiki/Radio \"Radio\") [wavelength](/wiki/Wavelength \"Wavelength\") to\ncommunicate, which allowed for less power and smaller\n[antennas](/wiki/Antenna_\\(electronics\\) \"Antenna \\(electronics\\)\") than many\nolder craft, which used [S band](/wiki/S_band \"S band\").\n\nNavigators sent commands through two antennas on the cruise stage: a cruise\n[low-gain antenna](/wiki/Low-gain_antenna \"Low-gain antenna\") mounted inside\nthe inner ring, and a cruise medium-gain antenna in the outer ring. The low-\ngain antenna was used close to Earth. It is omni-directional, so the\ntransmission power that reached Earth fell faster with increasing distance. As\nthe craft moved closer to Mars, the Sun and Earth moved closer in the sky as\nviewed from the craft, so less energy reached Earth. The spacecraft then\nswitched to the medium-gain antenna, which directed the same amount of\ntransmission power into a tighter beam toward Earth.\n\nDuring flight, the spacecraft was [spin-stabilized](/wiki/Gyroscope\n\"Gyroscope\") with a spin rate of two [revolutions per\nminute](/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute \"Revolutions per minute\") (rpm). Periodic\nupdates kept antennas pointed toward Earth and solar panels toward the Sun.\n\n###\nAeroshell[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Aeroshell\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Mars_Rover_Aeroshell.jpg/250px-\nMars_Rover_Aeroshell.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mars_Rover_Aeroshell.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mars_Rover_Aeroshell.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOverview of the Mars Exploration Rover aeroshell\n\nThe aeroshell maintained a protective covering for the lander during the\nseven-month voyage to Mars. Together with the lander and the rover, it\nconstituted the \"entry vehicle\". Its main purpose was to protect the lander\nand the rover inside it from the intense heat of entry into the thin Martian\natmosphere. It was based on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Viking designs.\n\n####\nParts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Parts\")]\n\nThe aeroshell was made of two main parts: a [heat shield](/wiki/Heat_shield\n\"Heat shield\") and a backshell. The heat shield was flat and brownish, and\nprotected the lander and rover during entry into the Martian atmosphere and\nacted as the first [aerobrake](/wiki/Aerobrake \"Aerobrake\") for the\nspacecraft. The backshell was large, cone-shaped and painted white. It carried\nthe [parachute](/wiki/Parachute \"Parachute\") and several components used in\nlater stages of entry, descent, and landing, including:\n\n  * A parachute (stowed at the bottom of the backshell);\n  * The backshell electronics and batteries that fire off pyrotechnic devices like separation nuts, rockets and the parachute mortar;\n  * A Litton LN-200 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which monitors and reports the orientation of the backshell as it swings under the parachute;\n  * Three large [solid rocket](/wiki/Solid_rocket \"Solid rocket\") motors called RAD rockets (Rocket Assisted Descent), each providing about a ton of force (10 [kilonewtons](/wiki/Kilonewton \"Kilonewton\")) for about 60 seconds;\n  * Three small solid rockets called TIRS (mounted so that they aim horizontally out the sides of the backshell) that provide a small horizontal kick to the backshell to help orient the backshell more vertically during the main RAD rocket burn.\n\n####\nComposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\nBuilt by the [Lockheed Martin](/wiki/Lockheed_Martin \"Lockheed Martin\")\nAstronautics Co. in Denver, Colorado, the aeroshell is made of an aluminium\nhoneycomb structure sandwiched between [graphite-epoxy](/wiki/Graphite-epoxy\n\"Graphite-epoxy\") face sheets. The outside of the aeroshell is covered with a\nlayer of [phenolic](/wiki/Phenol \"Phenol\") honeycomb. This honeycomb is filled\nwith an [ablative](/wiki/Ablation \"Ablation\") material (also called an\n\"ablator\"), that dissipates heat generated by atmospheric friction.\n\nThe ablator itself is a unique blend of [cork](/wiki/Cork_\\(material\\) \"Cork\n\\(material\\)\") wood, [binder](/wiki/Binder_\\(material\\) \"Binder \\(material\\)\")\nand many tiny [silica](/wiki/Silica \"Silica\") glass spheres. It was invented\nfor the heat shields flown on the Viking Mars lander missions. A similar\ntechnology was used in the first US [manned space\nmissions](/wiki/Manned_space_mission \"Manned space mission\")\n[Mercury](/wiki/Mercury_program \"Mercury program\"),\n[Gemini](/wiki/Gemini_program \"Gemini program\") and\n[Apollo](/wiki/Apollo_program \"Apollo program\"). It was specially formulated\nto react chemically with the Martian atmosphere during\n[entry](/wiki/Atmospheric_entry \"Atmospheric entry\") and carry heat away,\nleaving a hot wake of gas behind the vehicle. The vehicle slowed from 19,000\nto 1,600 km/h (5,300 to 440 m/s) in about a minute, producing about 60 m/s2 (6\n_[g](/wiki/G-force \"G-force\")_) of [acceleration](/wiki/Acceleration\n\"Acceleration\") on the lander and rover.\n\nThe backshell and heat shield are made of the same materials, but the heat\nshield has a thicker, 13 mm (1⁄2 in), layer of the ablator. Instead of being\npainted, the backshell was covered with a very thin aluminized [PET\nfilm](/wiki/PET_film_\\(biaxially_oriented\\) \"PET film \\(biaxially oriented\\)\")\nblanket to protect it from the cold of deep space. The blanket vaporized\nduring entry into the Martian atmosphere.\n\n###\nParachute[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Parachute\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Parachute1.jpg/220px-\nParachute1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Parachute1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Parachute1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMars Exploration Rover's parachute test\n\nThe parachute helped slow the spacecraft during entry, descent, and landing.\nIt is located in the backshell.[45]\n\n####\nDesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\nThe 2003 parachute design was part of a long-term Mars parachute technology\ndevelopment effort and is based on the designs and experience of the Viking\nand Pathfinder missions. The parachute for this mission is 40% larger than\nPathfinder's because the largest load for the Mars Exploration Rover is 80 to\n85 [kilonewtons](/wiki/Newton_\\(units\\) \"Newton \\(units\\)\") (kN) or 80 to 85\nkN (18,000 to 19,000 lbf) when the parachute fully inflates. By comparison,\nPathfinder's inflation loads were approximately 35 kN (about 8,000 lbf). The\nparachute was designed and constructed in [South Windsor,\nConnecticut](/wiki/South_Windsor,_Connecticut \"South Windsor, Connecticut\") by\n[Pioneer Aerospace](/wiki/Pioneer_Aerospace \"Pioneer Aerospace\"), the company\nthat also designed the parachute for the\n_[Stardust](/wiki/Stardust_\\(spacecraft\\) \"Stardust \\(spacecraft\\)\")_\nmission.[45]\n\n####\nComposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\nThe parachute is made of two durable, lightweight fabrics:\n[polyester](/wiki/Polyester \"Polyester\") and [nylon](/wiki/Nylon \"Nylon\"). A\ntriple bridle made of [Kevlar](/wiki/Kevlar \"Kevlar\") connects the parachute\nto the backshell.\n\nThe amount of space available on the spacecraft for the parachute is so small\nthat the parachute had to be pressure-packed. Before launch, a team tightly\nfolded the 48 suspension lines, three bridle lines, and the parachute. The\nparachute team loaded the parachute in a special structure that then applied a\nheavy weight to the parachute package several times. Before placing the\nparachute into the backshell, the parachute was heat set to\n[sterilize](/wiki/Sterilization_\\(microbiology\\) \"Sterilization\n\\(microbiology\\)\") it.[45]\n\n#### Connected\nsystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Connected systems\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Rocket_assisted_descent.jpg/220px-\nRocket_assisted_descent.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rocket_assisted_descent.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rocket_assisted_descent.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDescent is halted by [retrorockets](/wiki/Retrorocket \"Retrorocket\") and\nlander is dropped 10 m (33 ft) to the surface in this computer generated\nimpression.\n\n**Zylon Bridles** : After the parachute was deployed at an altitude of about\n10 km (6.2 mi) above the surface, the heatshield was released using 6\nseparation nuts and push-off springs. The lander then separated from the\nbackshell and \"rappelled\" down a metal tape on a [centrifugal braking\nsystem](/w/index.php?title=Centrifugal_brake&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Centrifugal brake \\(page does not exist\\)\") built into one of the lander\npetals. The slow descent down the metal tape placed the lander in position at\nthe end of another bridle (tether), made of a nearly 20 m (66 ft) long braided\n[Zylon](/wiki/Zylon \"Zylon\").[45]\n\nZylon is an advanced fiber material, similar to Kevlar, that is sewn in a\nwebbing pattern (like shoelace material) to make it stronger. The Zylon bridle\nprovides space for airbag deployment, distance from the solid rocket motor\nexhaust stream, and increased stability. The bridle incorporates an electrical\nharness that allows the firing of the solid rockets from the backshell as well\nas provides data from the backshell inertial measurement unit (which measures\nrate and tilt of the spacecraft) to the flight computer in the rover.[45]\n\n**Rocket assisted descent (RAD)** motors: Because the atmospheric density of\nMars is less than 1% of Earth's, the parachute alone could not slow down the\nMars Exploration Rover enough to ensure a safe, low landing speed. The\nspacecraft descent was assisted by rockets that brought the spacecraft to a\ndead stop 10–15 m (33–49 ft) above the Martian surface.[45]\n\n**Radar altimeter unit** : A [radar](/wiki/Radar \"Radar\")\n[altimeter](/wiki/Altimeter \"Altimeter\") unit was used to determine the\ndistance to the Martian surface. The radar's antenna is mounted at one of the\nlower corners of the lander tetrahedron. When the radar measurement showed the\nlander was the correct distance above the surface, the Zylon bridle was cut,\nreleasing the lander from the parachute and backshell so that it was free and\nclear for landing. The radar data also enabled the timing sequence on airbag\ninflation and backshell RAD rocket firing.[45]\n\n###\nAirbags[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Airbags\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Airbags.jpg/220px-\nAirbags.jpg)](/wiki/File:Airbags.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Airbags.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nArtist's concept of inflated airbags\n\n[Airbags](/wiki/Airbag \"Airbag\") used in the Mars Exploration Rover mission\nare the same type that Mars Pathfinder used in 1997. They had to be strong\nenough to cushion the spacecraft if it landed on rocks or rough terrain and\nallow it to bounce across Mars' surface at highway speeds (about 100 km/h)\nafter landing. The airbags had to be inflated seconds before touchdown and\ndeflated once safely on the ground.\n\nThe airbags were made of [Vectran](/wiki/Vectran \"Vectran\"), like those on\nPathfinder. Vectran has almost twice the strength of other synthetic\nmaterials, such as Kevlar, and performs better in cold temperatures. Six 100\n[denier](/wiki/Denier_\\(measure\\) \"Denier \\(measure\\)\") (10 mg/m) layers of\nVectran protected one or two inner bladders of Vectran in 200 denier (20\nmg/m). Using 100 denier (10 mg/m) leaves more fabric in the outer layers where\nit is needed, because there are more threads in the weave.\n\nEach rover used four airbags with six lobes each, all of which were connected.\nConnection was important, since it helped abate some of the landing forces by\nkeeping the bag system flexible and responsive to ground pressure. The airbags\nwere not attached directly to the rover, but were held to it by ropes\ncrisscrossing the bag structure. The ropes gave the bags shape, making\ninflation easier. While in flight, the bags were stowed along with three gas\ngenerators that are used for inflation.\n\n###\nLander[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Lander\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Opportunity_Lander_Petals_PIA04848.jpg/220px-\nOpportunity_Lander_Petals_PIA04848.jpg)](/wiki/File:Opportunity_Lander_Petals_PIA04848.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Opportunity_Lander_Petals_PIA04848.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMER lander petals opening (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nThe spacecraft lander is a protective shell that houses the rover, and\ntogether with the airbags, protects it from the forces of impact.\n\nThe lander is a [tetrahedron](/wiki/Tetrahedron \"Tetrahedron\") shape, whose\nsides open like petals. It is strong and light, and made of beams and sheets.\nThe beams consist of layers of [graphite](/wiki/Graphite \"Graphite\") fiber\nwoven into a fabric that is lighter than aluminium and more rigid than steel.\nTitanium fittings are glued and fitted onto the beams to allow it to be bolted\ntogether. The rover was held inside the lander by [bolts](/wiki/Screw \"Screw\")\nand special nuts that were released after landing with small explosives.\n\n####\nUprighting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Uprighting\")]\n\nAfter the lander stopped bouncing and rolling on the ground, it came to rest\non the base of the tetrahedron or one of its sides. The sides then opened to\nmake the base horizontal and the rover upright. The sides are connected to the\nbase by hinges, each of which has a motor strong enough to lift the lander.\nThe rover plus lander has a [mass](/wiki/Mass \"Mass\") of about 533 kilograms\n(1,175 [pounds](/wiki/Pound_\\(mass\\) \"Pound \\(mass\\)\")). The rover alone has a\nmass of about 185 kg (408 lb). The gravity on Mars is about 38% of Earth's, so\nthe motor does not need to be as powerful as it would on Earth.\n\nThe rover contains [accelerometers](/wiki/Accelerometer \"Accelerometer\") to\ndetect which way is down (toward the surface of Mars) by measuring the pull of\ngravity. The rover computer then commanded the correct lander petal to open to\nplace the rover upright. Once the base petal was down and the rover was\nupright, the other two petals were opened.\n\nThe petals initially opened to an equally flat position, so all sides of the\nlander were straight and level. The petal motors are strong enough so that if\ntwo of the petals come to rest on rocks, the base with the rover would be held\nin place like a bridge above the ground. The base will hold at a level even\nwith the height of the petals resting on rocks, making a straight flat surface\nthroughout the length of the open, flattened lander. The flight team on Earth\ncould then send commands to the rover to adjust the petals and create a safe\npath for the rover to drive off the lander and onto the Martian surface\nwithout dropping off a steep rock.\n\n#### Moving the payload onto\nMars[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Moving the payload onto Mars\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/MER_Spirit_Lander_Pan_Sol16-A18R1_br2.jpg/220px-\nMER_Spirit_Lander_Pan_Sol16-A18R1_br2.jpg)](/wiki/File:MER_Spirit_Lander_Pan_Sol16-A18R1_br2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MER_Spirit_Lander_Pan_Sol16-A18R1_br2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Spirit '_s lander on Mars\n\nThe moving of the rover off the lander is called the egress phase of the\nmission. The rover must avoid having its wheels caught in the airbag material\nor falling off a sharp incline. To help this, a retraction system on the\npetals slowly drags the airbags toward the lander before the petals open.\nSmall ramps on the petals fan out to fill spaces between the petals. They\ncover uneven terrain, rock obstacles, and airbag material, and form a circular\narea from which the rover can drive off in more directions. They also lower\nthe step that the rover must climb down. They are nicknamed \"batwings\", and\nare made of Vectran cloth.\n\nAbout three hours were allotted to retract the airbags and deploy the lander\npetals.\n\n## Rover\ndesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Rover design\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/MER_vs._Sojourner_PIA04827.jpg/220px-\nMER_vs._Sojourner_PIA04827.jpg)](/wiki/File:MER_vs._Sojourner_PIA04827.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MER_vs._Sojourner_PIA04827.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMars Exploration Rover (rear) vs. [_Sojourner_](/wiki/Mars_Pathfinder \"Mars\nPathfinder\") rover (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Mars_Exploration_Rover.stl/220px-\nMars_Exploration_Rover.stl.png)3D](/wiki/File:Mars_Exploration_Rover.stl)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mars_Exploration_Rover.stl \"Enlarge\")\n\nInteractive 3D model of the MER\n\nThe rovers are six-wheeled, solar-powered robots that stand 1.5 m (4.9 ft)\nhigh, 2.3 m (7.5 ft) wide and 1.6 m (5.2 ft) long.

The design reduces the range of motion of\nthe rover body by half, and allows the rover to go over obstacles or through\nholes that are more than a wheel diameter (250 millimeters (9.8 in)) in size.\nThe rover wheels are designed with integral compliant [flexures](/wiki/Flexure\n\"Flexure\") which provide shock absorption during movement.[47] Additionally,\nthe wheels have cleats which provide grip for climbing in soft sand and\nscrambling over rocks.\n\nEach wheel has its own drive motor. The two front and two rear wheels each\nhave individual steering motors. This allows the vehicle to turn in place, a\nfull revolution, and to swerve and curve, making arching turns. The rover is\ndesigned to withstand a tilt of 45 degrees in any direction without\noverturning. However, the rover is programmed through its \"fault protection\nlimits\" in its hazard avoidance software to avoid exceeding tilts of 30\ndegrees.\n\nEach rover can spin one of its front wheels in place to grind deep into the\nterrain. It is to remain motionless while the digging wheel is spinning. The\nrovers have a top speed on flat hard ground of 50 mm/s (2 in/s). The average\nspeed is 10 mm/s, because its hazard avoidance software causes it to stop\nevery 10 seconds for 20 seconds to observe and understand the terrain into\nwhich it has driven.\n\n### Power and electronic\nsystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Power and electronic systems\")]\n\nSee also: [Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars\nrovers](/wiki/Comparison_of_embedded_computer_systems_on_board_the_Mars_rovers\n\"Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Mars_Spirit_rover%27s_solar_panels_covered_with_Dust_-\n_October_2007.jpg/220px-Mars_Spirit_rover%27s_solar_panels_covered_with_Dust_-\n_October_2007.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mars_Spirit_rover%27s_solar_panels_covered_with_Dust_-\n_October_2007.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mars_Spirit_rover%27s_solar_panels_covered_with_Dust_-\n_October_2007.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCircular projection showing MER-A _Spirit '_s solar panels covered in dust in\nOctober 2007 on Mars. Unexpected [cleaning events](/wiki/Cleaning_event\n\"Cleaning event\") have periodically increased power.\n\nWhen fully illuminated, the rover\n[triplejunction](/wiki/Multijunction_photovoltaic_cell \"Multijunction\nphotovoltaic cell\")[48] solar arrays generate about 140 watts for up to four\nhours per Martian day ([sol](/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Sols \"Timekeeping on\nMars\")). The rover needs about 100 watts to drive. Its power system includes\ntwo rechargeable [lithium ion](/wiki/Lithium_ion \"Lithium ion\") batteries\nweighing 7.15 kg (15.8 lb) each, that provide energy when the sun is not\nshining, especially at night. Over time, the batteries will degrade and will\nnot be able to recharge to full capacity.\n\nFor comparison, the [Mars Science Laboratory](/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory\n\"Mars Science Laboratory\")'s power system is composed of a [Multi-Mission\nRadioisotope Thermoelectric Generator](/wiki/Multi-\nMission_Radioisotope_Thermoelectric_Generator \"Multi-Mission Radioisotope\nThermoelectric Generator\") (MMRTG) produced by Boeing.[49] The MMRTG is\ndesigned to provide 125W of electrical power at the start of the mission,\nfalling to 100W after 14 years of service.[50] It is used to power the MSL's\nmany systems and instruments. Solar panels were also considered for the MSL,\nbut RTGs provide constant power, regardless of the time of day, and thus the\nversatility to work in dark environments and high latitudes where solar energy\nis not readily available. The MSL generates 2.5 [kilowatt\nhours](/wiki/Kilowatt_hour \"Kilowatt hour\") per day, compared to the Mars\nExploration Rovers, which can generate about 0.6 kilowatt hours per day.[51]\n\nIt was thought that by the end of the 90-sol mission, the capability of the\nsolar arrays to generate power would likely be reduced to about 50 watts. This\nwas due to anticipated dust coverage on the solar arrays, and the change in\nseason. Over three Earth years later, however, the rovers' power supplies\nhovered between 300 [watt-hours](/wiki/Watt-hour \"Watt-hour\") and 900 watt-\nhours per day, depending on dust coverage. Cleaning events (dust removal by\nwind) have occurred more often than NASA expected, keeping the arrays\nrelatively free of dust and extending the life of the mission. During a 2007\nglobal dust storm on Mars, both rovers experienced some of the lowest power of\nthe mission; _Opportunity_ dipped to 128 watt-hours. In November 2008, Spirit\nhad overtaken this low-energy record with a production of 89 watt-hours, due\nto dust storms in the region of Gusev crater.[52]\n\nThe rovers run a [VxWorks](/wiki/VxWorks \"VxWorks\") [embedded operating\nsystem](/wiki/Embedded_operating_system \"Embedded operating system\") on a\n[radiation-hardened](/wiki/Radiation_hardened \"Radiation hardened\") 20\n[MHz](/wiki/Megahertz \"Megahertz\") [RAD6000](/wiki/RAD6000 \"RAD6000\")\n[CPU](/wiki/Central_processing_unit \"Central processing unit\") with 128\n[MB](/wiki/Megabyte \"Megabyte\") of [DRAM](/wiki/DRAM \"DRAM\") with error\ndetection and correction and 3 MB of [EEPROM](/wiki/EEPROM \"EEPROM\"). Each\nrover also has 256 MB of [flash memory](/wiki/Flash_memory \"Flash memory\"). To\nsurvive during the various mission phases, the rover's vital instruments must\nstay within a temperature of −40 °C to +40 °C (−40 °F to 104 °F). At night,\nthe rovers are heated by eight [radioisotope heater\nunits](/wiki/Radioisotope_heater_units \"Radioisotope heater units\") (RHU),\nwhich each continuously generate 1 [W](/wiki/Watt \"Watt\") of thermal energy\nfrom the decay of [radioisotopes](/wiki/Radioisotope \"Radioisotope\"), along\nwith electrical heaters that operate only when necessary.

Three are mounted on the Pancam Mast\nAssembly (PMA):\n\n  * Panoramic Cameras ([Pancam](/wiki/Pancam \"Pancam\")), two cameras with color filter wheels for determining the texture, color, [mineralogy](/wiki/Mineralogy \"Mineralogy\"), and structure of the local terrain.\n  * Navigation Cameras ([Navcam](/wiki/Navcam \"Navcam\")), two cameras that have larger fields of view but lower resolution and are monochromatic, for navigation and driving.\n  * A periscope assembly for the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer ([Mini-TES](/wiki/Mini-TES \"Mini-TES\")), which identifies promising rocks and soils for closer examination, and determines the processes that formed them. The Mini-TES was built by [Arizona State University](/wiki/Arizona_State_University \"Arizona State University\"). The periscope assembly features two beryllium fold mirrors, a shroud that closes to minimize dust contamination in the assembly, and stray-light rejection baffles that are strategically placed within the graphite epoxy tubes.\n\nThe cameras are mounted 1.5 meters high on the Pancam Mast Assembly. The PMA\nis deployed via the Mast Deployment Drive (MDD). The Azimuth Drive, mounted\ndirectly above the MDD, turns the assembly horizontally a whole revolution\nwith signals transmitted through a rolling tape configuration. The camera\ndrive points the cameras in elevation, almost straight up or down. A third\nmotor points the Mini-TES fold mirrors and protective shroud, up to 30° above\nthe horizon and 50° below. The PMA's conceptual design was done by Jason\nSuchman at JPL, the Cognizant Engineer who later served as Contract Technical\nManager (CTM) once the assembly was built by [Ball Aerospace & Technologies\nCorp.](/wiki/Ball_Aerospace_%26_Technologies_Corp. \"Ball Aerospace &\nTechnologies Corp.\"), [Boulder, Colorado](/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado \"Boulder,\nColorado\"). Raul Romero served as CTM once subsystem-level testing began.\nSatish Krishnan did the conceptual design of the High-Gain Antenna Gimbal\n(HGAG), whose detailed design, assembly, and test was also performed by Ball\nAerospace at which point Satish acted as the CTM.\n\nFour monochromatic hazard cameras ([Hazcams](/wiki/Hazcam \"Hazcam\")) are\nmounted on the rover's body, two in front and two behind.\n\nThe instrument deployment device (IDD), also called the rover arm, holds the\nfollowing:\n\n  * [Mössbauer spectrometer](/wiki/M%C3%B6ssbauer_spectrometer \"Mössbauer spectrometer\") (MB) [MIMOS II](/wiki/MIMOS_II \"MIMOS II\"), developed by Dr. Göstar Klingelhöfer at the [Johannes Gutenberg](/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg \"Johannes Gutenberg\") University in [Mainz](/wiki/Mainz \"Mainz\"), [Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\"), is used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils.[55][56]\n  * [Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer](/wiki/Alpha_particle_X-ray_spectrometer \"Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer\") (APXS), developed by the [Max Planck Institute for Chemistry](/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Chemistry \"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry\") in [Mainz](/wiki/Mainz \"Mainz\"), [Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\"), is used for close-up analysis of the abundances of elements that make up rocks and soils.[57] Universities involved in developing the APXS include the [University of Guelph](/wiki/University_of_Guelph \"University of Guelph\"), [University of California](/wiki/University_of_California \"University of California\"), and [Cornell University](/wiki/Cornell_University \"Cornell University\")\n  * Magnets, for collecting magnetic dust particles,[58] developed by [Jens Martin Knudsen](/wiki/Jens_Martin_Knudsen \"Jens Martin Knudsen\")'s group at the [Niels Bohr Institute](/wiki/Niels_Bohr_Institute_for_Astronomy,_Physics_and_Geophysics \"Niels Bohr Institute for Astronomy, Physics and Geophysics\"), [Copenhagen](/wiki/Copenhagen \"Copenhagen\"). The particles are analyzed by the Mössbauer Spectrometer and [X-ray](/wiki/X-ray \"X-ray\") Spectrometer to help determine the ratio of magnetic particles to non-magnetic particles and the composition of magnetic minerals in airborne dust and rocks that have been ground by the Rock Abrasion Tool. There are also magnets on the front of the rover, which are studied extensively by the Mössbauer spectrometer.\n  * Microscopic Imager (MI) for obtaining close-up, high-resolution images of rocks and soils. Development was led by Ken Herkenhoff's team at the [USGS](/wiki/USGS \"USGS\") [Astrogeology Research Program](/wiki/Astrogeology_Research_Program \"Astrogeology Research Program\").\n  * [Rock Abrasion Tool](/wiki/Rock_Abrasion_Tool \"Rock Abrasion Tool\") (RAT), developed by [Honeybee Robotics](/wiki/Honeybee_Robotics \"Honeybee Robotics\"), for removing dusty and weathered rock surfaces and exposing fresh material for examination by instruments on board.\n\nThe robotic arm is able to place instruments directly up against rock and soil\ntargets of interest.\n\n## Naming of _Spirit_ and\n_Opportunity_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Naming of Spirit and Opportunity\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Sofi_Collis_MER.jpg/220px-\nSofi_Collis_MER.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sofi_Collis_MER.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sofi_Collis_MER.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSofi Collis with a model of Mars Exploration Rover\n\nThe _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_ rovers were named through a student essay\ncompetition. The winning entry was by Sofi Collis,[59] a third-grade Russian-\nAmerican student from Arizona.\n\n> I used to live in an orphanage. It was dark and cold and lonely.

Internally, NASA also\nuses the mission designations MER-A (_Spirit_) and MER-B (_Opportunity_) based\non the order of landing on Mars (_Spirit_ first then _Opportunity_).\n\n## Test\nrovers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Test rovers\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Rover_testing.jpg/220px-\nRover_testing.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rover_testing.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rover_testing.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRover team members simulate _Spirit_ in a Martian sandtrap.\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory maintains a pair of rovers, the _Surface System\nTest-Beds_ (SSTB) at its location in Pasadena for testing and modeling of\nsituations on Mars. One test rover, SSTB1, weighing approximately 180\nkilograms (400 lb), is fully instrumented and nearly identical to _Spirit_ and\n_Opportunity_. Another test version, _SSTB-Lite_ , is identical in size and\ndrive characteristics but does not include all instruments. It weighs in at 80\nkilograms (180 lb), much closer to the weight of _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_ in\nthe reduced [gravity of Mars](/wiki/Gravity_of_Mars \"Gravity of Mars\"). These\nrovers were used in 2009 for a simulation of the incident in which _Spirit_\nbecame trapped in soft soil.[60][61][62]\n\n## SAP[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: SAP\")]\n\nThe NASA team uses a software application called _SAP_ to view images\ncollected from the rover, and to plan its daily activities.

The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of [basalt](/wiki/Basalt\n\"Basalt\"). They contain the minerals [olivine](/wiki/Olivine \"Olivine\"),\n[pyroxene](/wiki/Pyroxene \"Pyroxene\"), [plagioclase](/wiki/Plagioclase\n\"Plagioclase\"), and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are\nfine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and\nvugs).[64][65] Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the\nlocal rocks. Fairly high levels of [nickel](/wiki/Nickel \"Nickel\") were found\nin some soils; probably from [meteorites](/wiki/Meteorites \"Meteorites\").[66]\nAnalysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of\nwater. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited\nminerals, maybe [bromine](/wiki/Bromine \"Bromine\") compounds. All the rocks\ncontain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material. One\ntype can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the [Rock\nAbrasion Tool](/wiki/Rock_Abrasion_Tool \"Rock Abrasion Tool\") (RAT).[67]\n\nThere are a variety of rocks in the [Columbia\nHills](/wiki/Columbia_Hills_\\(Mars\\) \"Columbia Hills \\(Mars\\)\"), some of which\nhave been altered by water, but not by very much water.\n\nAdirondack\n[![Adirondacksquare.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Adirondacksquare.jpg/260px-\nAdirondacksquare.jpg)](/wiki/File:Adirondacksquare.jpg)  \n---  \nCoordinates|  [14°36′S 175°30′E﻿ / ﻿14.6°S 175.5°E﻿ / -14.6;\n175.5](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Mars_Exploration_Rover&params=14.6_S_175.5_E_globe:mars_type:landmark)[Coordinates](/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system\n\"Geographic coordinate system\"): [14°36′S 175°30′E﻿ / ﻿14.6°S 175.5°E﻿ /\n-14.6;\n175.5](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Mars_Exploration_Rover&params=14.6_S_175.5_E_globe:mars_type:landmark)  \n  \nThese rocks can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of\nminerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts. The\nrocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic\n[komatiites](/wiki/Komatiites \"Komatiites\"). Rocks of the plains also resemble\nthe basaltic [shergottites](/wiki/Shergottite \"Shergottite\"), meteorites which\ncame from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali\nelements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains\nrocks lie near the junction of basalt, [picrobasalt](/wiki/Picrobasalt\n\"Picrobasalt\"), and tephite. The Irvine-Barager classification calls them\nbasalts.[64] Plain’s rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin\nfilms of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored\nmaterial that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds. It is\nthought that small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing\nmineralization processes).[65][64] Coatings on the rocks may have occurred\nwhen rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust. One\nsign that they were altered was that it was easier to grind these rocks\ncompared to the same types of rocks found on Earth.\n\nThe first rock that _Spirit_ studied was Adirondack. It turned out to be\ntypical of the other rocks on the plains.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Spirit%27s_First_Color_Photograph_Mars.jpg/191px-Spirit%27s_First_Color_Photograph_Mars.jpg)](/wiki/File:Spirit%27s_First_Color_Photograph_Mars.jpg)\n\nFirst color picture from Gusev crater.

Veins of\nwater-deposited veins are visible, along with crystals of olivine. Veins may\ncontain bromine salts.\n\n####\nDust[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Dust\")]\n\nThe dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the\ndust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, _Spirit_ found the\n[magnetism](/wiki/Magnetism \"Magnetism\") was caused by the mineral\n[magnetite](/wiki/Magnetite \"Magnetite\"), especially magnetite that contained\nthe element [titanium](/wiki/Titanium \"Titanium\"). One magnet was able to\ncompletely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be\nmagnetic.[68] The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low\nthermal inertia regions like [Tharsis](/wiki/Tharsis \"Tharsis\") and Arabia\nthat have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe\nless than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a\nsmall amount of chemically bound water.[69][70]\n\n#### Columbia\nHills[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Columbia Hills\")]\n\nAs the rover climbed above the plains onto the Columbia Hills, the mineralogy\nthat was seen changed.[71][72] Scientists found a variety of rock types in the\nColumbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories. The six\nare: Clovis, Wishbone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence. They are\nnamed after a prominent rock in each group. Their chemical compositions, as\nmeasured by APXS, are significantly different from each other.[73] Most\nimportantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of\nalteration due to aqueous fluids.[74] They are enriched in the elements\nphosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine—all of which can be carried around\nin water solutions. The Columbia Hills’ rocks contain basaltic glass, along\nwith varying amounts of olivine and [sulfates](/wiki/Sulfate\n\"Sulfate\").[75][76] The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of\nsulfates. This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but\nhelps to produce sulfates.\n\nThe Clovis group is especially interesting because the [Mössbauer\nspectrometer](/wiki/M%C3%B6ssbauer_spectrometer \"Mössbauer spectrometer\") (MB)\ndetected [goethite](/wiki/Goethite \"Goethite\") in it.[77] Goethite forms only\nin the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of\npast water in the Columbia Hills's rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks\nand outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence,[75] although the\nrocks probably once contained much olivine.[78] Olivine is a marker for the\nlack of water because it easily decomposes in the presence of water. Sulfate\nwas found, and it needs water to form. Wishstone contained a great deal of\nplagioclase, some olivine, and [anhydrate](/wiki/Anhydrate \"Anhydrate\") (a\nsulfate). Peace rocks showed [sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur \"Sulfur\") and strong\nevidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class\nrocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The\nIndependence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member\nof the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to\nform. One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an\nevaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur,\n[phosphorus](/wiki/Phosphorus \"Phosphorus\"), [calcium](/wiki/Calcium\n\"Calcium\"), and iron.[79] Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles\nsoil was of the oxidized, Fe3+ form. Towards the middle of the six-year\nmission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of\npure [silica](/wiki/Silica \"Silica\") were found in the soil. The silica could\nhave come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic\nactivity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring\nenvironment.[80]\n\nAfter _Spirit_ stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature\nThermal Emission Spectrometer, or [Mini-TES](/wiki/Mini-TES \"Mini-TES\") and\nconfirmed the presence of large amounts of [carbonate](/wiki/Carbonate\n\"Carbonate\")-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once\nharbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called\n\"Comanche.\"[81][82]\n\nIn summary, _Spirit_ found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of\nGusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills\nthere was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The\nevidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only\nform in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held\na lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the\ndust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some\ntitanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars\nis the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n### _Opportunity_ Landing Site, Meridiani\nPlanum[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Opportunity Landing Site, Meridiani Planum\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/PIA17759-MarsOpportunityRover-\nSelfPortrait-20140106.jpg/220px-PIA17759-MarsOpportunityRover-\nSelfPortrait-20140106.jpg)](/wiki/File:PIA17759-MarsOpportunityRover-\nSelfPortrait-20140106.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PIA17759-MarsOpportunityRover-SelfPortrait-20140106.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nSelf-portrait of [_Opportunity_](/wiki/Opportunity_\\(rover\\) \"Opportunity\n\\(rover\\)\") near [Endeavour Crater](/wiki/Endeavour_\\(crater\\) \"Endeavour\n\\(crater\\)\") on the surface of [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\") (January 6, 2014).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/PIA21497capetrib.jpg/220px-\nPIA21497capetrib.jpg)](/wiki/File:PIA21497capetrib.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PIA21497capetrib.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Cape Tribulation](/wiki/Cape_Tribulation_\\(Mars\\) \"Cape Tribulation\n\\(Mars\\)\") southern end, as seen in 2017 by Opportunity rover\n\nThe _Opportunity_ rover landed in a small crater, dubbed \"Eagle\", on the flat\nplains of Meridiani. The plains of the landing site were characterized by the\npresence of a large number of small [spherules](/wiki/Martian_spherules\n\"Martian spherules\"), spherical [concretions](/wiki/Concretion \"Concretion\")\nthat were tagged \"blueberries\" by the science team, which were found both\nloose on the surface, and also embedded in the rock. These proved to have a\nhigh concentration of the mineral [hematite](/wiki/Hematite \"Hematite\"), and\nshowed the signature of being formed in an aqueous environment. The layered\nbedrock revealed in the crater walls showed signs of being sedimentary in\nnature, and compositional and microscopic-imagery analysis showed this to be\nprimarily with composition of [Jarosite](/wiki/Jarosite \"Jarosite\"), a ferrous\nsulfate mineral that is characteristically an [evaporite](/wiki/Evaporite\n\"Evaporite\") that is the residue from the evaporation of a salty pond or\nsea.[83][84]\n\nThe mission has provided substantial evidence of past water activity on Mars.\nIn addition to investigating the \"water hypothesis\", _Opportunity_ has also\nobtained astronomical observations and atmospheric data. The extended mission\ntook the rover across the plains to a series of larger craters in the south,\nwith the arrival at the edge of a 25-km diameter crater, Endeavour Crater,\neight years after landing. The orbital spectroscopy of this crater rim show\nthe signs of [phyllosilicate](/wiki/Phyllosilicate \"Phyllosilicate\") rocks,\nindicative of older sedimentary deposits.\n\n## Landing\nlocations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mars_Exploration_Rover&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Landing locations\")]\n\n![Map of Mars](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Mars_Map.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mars_Map.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n![The image above contains clickable\nlinks](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Interactive_icon.svg/12px-\nInteractive_icon.svg.png)[Interactive imagemap](/wiki/Image_map \"Image map\")\nof the [global topography of Mars](/wiki/Geography_of_Mars \"Geography of\nMars\"), overlain with [locations of Mars landers and\nrovers](/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_on_Mars \"List of artificial objects\non Mars\") (Red label = [Rover](/wiki/Mars_rover \"Mars rover\"); Blue label =\n[Lander](/wiki/Mars_landing \"Mars landing\"); bold red/blue = currently\nactive).
