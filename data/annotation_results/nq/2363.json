The Mikaelson family is\ncalled \"the Originals\" as they are the first vampires to ever exist. Niklaus\n\"Klaus\" Mikaelson is a descendant of a [witch](/wiki/Witch \"Witch\") and a\n[werewolf](/wiki/Werewolf \"Werewolf\"), and his quest to unleash his\n[hybrid](/wiki/Hybrid_\\(biology\\) \"Hybrid \\(biology\\)\") nature was detailed in\n_[The Vampire Diaries](/wiki/The_Vampire_Diaries \"The Vampire Diaries\")_.

Having originally built the city, they had\nbeen forced to abandon it when fleeing from their vengeful father.

Klaus resolves that they must take down Marcel and get back the city\nthat once belonged to them. While doing that they must also protect their city\nfrom a war brewing between vampires, werewolves, and witches. Over time, new\nand old friendships are formed, love is in the air, death surrounds them, and\nthe Originals learn more about their own family past. The first season\ndescribes how Klaus's mystical child is going to be born and speaks of the\nthreats that the Originals together must keep her safe from. The second season\ndeals with the return of Klaus and his siblings' parents, and the arrival of\nan aunt who threatens the baby's life. The third season shows the Mikaelsons\nfacing both a prophecy that speaks of their downfall, and the first-sired\nvampires who have wanted revenge for a millennium. The fourth season jumps\nahead five years, with the Mikaelsons returning to New Orleans and having to\nface a reawakened ancient menace set on destroying anything in its path. The\nfifth and final season of the series takes place seven years after the fourth\nseason, with Hope now being a teenager at a school for supernatural children,\nthe Salvatore Boarding School for the Young and Gifted.\n\n## Cast and\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Originals_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast and characters\")]\n\nMain article: [List of The Originals\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_The_Originals_characters \"List of The Originals\ncharacters\")\n\n  * [Joseph Morgan](/wiki/Joseph_Morgan_\\(actor\\) \"Joseph Morgan \\(actor\\)\") as [Niklaus \"Klaus\" Mikaelson](/wiki/List_of_The_Originals_characters#Klaus_Mikaelson \"List of The Originals characters\"): The self-proclaimed King of New Orleans and the Original Hybrid: half-Original Vampire and half-werewolf.
