However, the earlier event matched\nsmall college teams, so the Outback / Hall of Fame Bowl is the first major\nbowl game to be played in the area.\n\n### Hall of Fame\nBowl[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Outback_Bowl&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Hall of Fame Bowl\")]\n\nThe [Hall of Fame Classic](/wiki/All-American_Bowl \"All-American Bowl\") was\nheld at [Legion Field](/wiki/Legion_Field \"Legion Field\") in [Birmingham,\nAlabama](/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama \"Birmingham, Alabama\") from 1977 to 1985.\nIn the spring of 1986, the [National Football\nFoundation](/wiki/National_Football_Foundation \"National Football Foundation\")\nand [College Football Hall of Fame](/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame\n\"College Football Hall of Fame\") decided to discontinue their association with\nthe bowl and realign with a new bowl game to be played in [Tampa\nStadium](/wiki/Tampa_Stadium \"Tampa Stadium\") which would inherit the Hall of\nFame Bowl name. Initially, the Hall of Fame Bowl did not have agreements with\nany conferences, so it usually matched a school from either the [Southeastern\nConference](/wiki/Southeastern_Conference \"Southeastern Conference\") or the\n[Atlantic Coast Conference](/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference \"Atlantic Coast\nConference\") against a team from another region of the country.\n\n### Outback Bowl[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Outback_Bowl&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Outback Bowl\")]\n\n[Outback Steakhouse](/wiki/Outback_Steakhouse \"Outback Steakhouse\") became the\ngame's title sponsor in 1995. At the same time, the newly renamed Outback Bowl\nsigned agreements with the Southeastern Conference and the [Big Ten\nConference](/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference \"Big Ten Conference\"), creating an annual\ninter-sectional matchup that has continued ever since.\n\nIn 1999, the Outback Bowl moved from Tampa Stadium into [Raymond James\nStadium](/wiki/Raymond_James_Stadium \"Raymond James Stadium\"), which had\nrecently been built adjacent to the old stadium.\n\n## The game[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Outback_Bowl&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: The game\")]\n\nThe Outback Bowl is played on [New Year's Day](/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day \"New\nYear's Day\") unless January 1 falls on a Sunday, in which case it is moved to\nthe following Monday. It is usually the first game to start on a day which is\ntraditionally full of college bowl games, and has kicked off as early as 11AM.\n[ESPN](/wiki/ESPN \"ESPN\") has had television rights to the game since 1993.\nUnder an extension of those rights signed in 2010, ESPN broadcasts the game on\neither [ABC](/wiki/ESPN_on_ABC \"ESPN on ABC\"), ESPN, or [ESPN2](/wiki/ESPN2\n\"ESPN2\"), in conjunction with the [Citrus Bowl](/wiki/Citrus_Bowl \"Citrus\nBowl\") and the [New Year's\nSix](/wiki/College_Football_Playoff_New_Year%27s_Six \"College Football Playoff\nNew Year's Six\") bowl games.[3] Before 1993, the Hall of Fame Bowl aired on\n[NBC](/wiki/NBC_Sports \"NBC Sports\").\n\nUpon signing agreements with the SEC and Big 10 in 1995, the Outback Bowl had\nthe third pick of teams from each conference after the [Bowl Championship\nSeries](/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series \"Bowl Championship Series\") teams were\nplaced. Since 2014, both the SEC and Big 10 have worked with a group of\nseveral bowl games, including the Outback Bowl, to place their bowl-eligible\nteams after the [College Football Playoff](/wiki/College_Football_Playoff\n\"College Football Playoff\") and associated bowls have made their\nselections.[4][5]\n\nAs of 2017, the Outback Bowl payout was $3.5 million for each team.\n\n## Game results[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Outback_Bowl&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Game results\")]\n\nFor \"Hall of Fame Bowl\" results from 1977 to 1985, see
