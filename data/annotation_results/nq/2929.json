Wright Mills](/wiki/C._Wright_Mills \"C. Wright Mills\"), in\nwhich Mills calls attention to the interwoven interests of the leaders of the\n[military](/wiki/Military \"Military\"), [corporate](/wiki/Corporate\n\"Corporate\"), and [political](/wiki/Political \"Political\") elements of\n[society](/wiki/Society \"Society\") and suggests that the ordinary\n[citizen](/wiki/Citizen \"Citizen\") is a relatively powerless subject of\nmanipulation by those entities.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Summary\n  * 3 Reception and criticism\n  * 4 In popular culture\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Background[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Power_Elite&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nThe book is something of a counterpart of Mills' 1951 work, _[White Collar:\nThe American Middle Classes](/wiki/White_Collar:_The_American_Middle_Classes\n\"White Collar: The American Middle Classes\")_ , which examines the then-\ngrowing role of [middle managers](/wiki/Middle_management \"Middle management\")\nin American society. A main inspiration for the book was [Franz Leopold\nNeumann](/wiki/Franz_Leopold_Neumann \"Franz Leopold Neumann\")'s book\n_[Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National\nSocialism](/wiki/Behemoth:_The_Structure_and_Practice_of_National_Socialism\n\"Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism\")_ in 1942, a\nstudy of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state like\nGermany. _Behemoth_ had a major impact on Mills and he claimed that Behemoth\nhad given him the \"tools to grasp and analyse the entire total structure and\nas a warning of what could happen in a modern capitalist democracy\".[1]\n\n## Summary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Power_Elite&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Summary\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_1949.jpg/275px-\nJoint_Chiefs_of_Staff_1949.jpg)](/wiki/File:Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_1949.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_1949.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Joint Chiefs of Staff](/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff \"Joint Chiefs of\nStaff\"), pictured here in 1949, are four of six ruling elites Mills\nidentified.\n\nAccording to Mills, the eponymous \"power elite\" are those that occupy the\ndominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and\npolitical) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions)\nhave enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, \"the\nunderlying populations of the world.\" The institutions which they head, Mills\nposits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors:\n(1) \"two or three hundred giant corporations\" which have replaced the\ntraditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order\nthat has inherited power from \"a decentralized set of several dozen states\"\nand \"now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure,\" and (3)\nthe military establishment, formerly an object of \"distrust fed by state\nmilitia,\" but now an entity with \"all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a\nsprawling bureaucratic domain.\"\n\nImportantly, and in distinction from modern American [conspiracy\ntheory](/wiki/Conspiracy_theory \"Conspiracy theory\"), Mills explains that the\nelite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that\n\"often they are uncertain about their roles\" and \"without conscious effort,\nthey absorb the aspiration to be ... The Ones Who Decide.\" Nonetheless, he\nsees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite,\naccording to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through\neducations obtained at [eastern](/wiki/East_coast_of_the_United_States \"East\ncoast of the United States\") establishment universities like\n[Harvard](/wiki/Harvard \"Harvard\"), [Princeton](/wiki/Princeton_University\n\"Princeton University\"), and [Yale](/wiki/Yale \"Yale\"). But, Mills notes,\n\"Harvard or Yale or Princeton is not enough ... the point is not Harvard, but\nwhich Harvard?\" Mills identifies two classes of [Ivy League](/wiki/Ivy_League\n\"Ivy League\") alumni, those initiated into an upper echelon\n[fraternity](/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities_in_North_America \"Fraternities\nand sororities in North America\") or [final club](/wiki/Final_club \"Final\nclub\"), such as [Porcellian](/wiki/Porcellian \"Porcellian\") and [Fly\nClub](/wiki/Fly_Club \"Fly Club\"), and those who are not. Those so initiated,\nMills continues, receive their invitations based on social links first\nestablished in elite private [preparatory academies](/wiki/University-\npreparatory_school#United_States \"University-preparatory school\"), where they\nare enrolled as part of antebellum family traditions. In this manner, the\nmantle of the elite generally passes through families.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Joseph_and_Rose_Kennedy_1940.JPG/275px-\nJoseph_and_Rose_Kennedy_1940.JPG)](/wiki/File:Joseph_and_Rose_Kennedy_1940.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Joseph_and_Rose_Kennedy_1940.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nHistorically prominent families, such as the Kennedy family, form the\n\"Metropolitan 400.\" Shown here are Rose and Joseph Kennedy in 1940.\n\nThe resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military,\neconomy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types,\naccording to Mills:\n\n  * the \"Metropolitan 400\" \\- members of historically notable local families in the principal American cities, generally represented on the [Social Register](/wiki/Social_Register \"Social Register\")\n  * \"Celebrities\" \\- prominent entertainers and media personalities\n  * the \"Chief Executives\" \\- presidents and CEOs of the most important companies within each industrial sector\n  * the \"Corporate Rich\" \\- major landowners and corporate shareholders\n  * the \"Warlords\" \\- senior military officers, most importantly the [Joint Chiefs of Staff](/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff \"Joint Chiefs of Staff\")\n  * the \"Political Directorate\" \\- \"fifty-odd men of the executive branch\" of the U.S. federal government, including the senior leadership in the [Executive Office of the President](/wiki/Executive_Office_of_the_President \"Executive Office of the President\"), sometimes variously drawn from elected officials of the [Democratic](/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_the_United_States \"Democratic Party of the United States\") and [Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_of_the_United_States \"Republican Party of the United States\") parties but usually professional government [bureaucrats](/wiki/Bureaucrat \"Bureaucrat\")\n\nMills formulated a very short summary of his book: \"Who, after all, runs\nAmerica? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power\nelite.\"[2]\n\n## Reception and\ncriticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Power_Elite&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Reception and criticism\")]\n\nCommenting on _The Power Elite_ , [Arthur M. Schlesinger,\nJr.](/wiki/Arthur_M._Schlesinger,_Jr. \"Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.\") derisively\nsaid, \"I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands back his prophet's\nrobes and settles down to being a sociologist again.\"[3]\n\n[Adolf Berle](/wiki/Adolf_Berle \"Adolf Berle\") noted the book contained \"an\nuncomfortable degree of truth\", but Mills presented \"an angry cartoon, not a\nserious picture\".[3] [Dennis Wrong](/wiki/Dennis_Wrong \"Dennis Wrong\")\ndescribed _The Power Elite_ as \"an uneven blend of journalism, sociology, and\nmoral indignation\".[4]\n\nA review of the book in the _Louisiana Law Review_ bemoaned that the\n\"practical danger of Mr. Mills' pessimistic interpretation of the current\nsituation is that his readers will concentrate on answering his prejudicial\nassertions rather than ponder the results of his really formidable\nresearch\".[5]\n\nNonetheless, consideration of the book has become moderately more favorable\nover time. In 2006, [G. William Domhoff](/wiki/G._William_Domhoff \"G. William\nDomhoff\") wrote, \"Mills looks even better than he did 50 years ago\".[6] Mills'\nbiographer, John Summers, admitted that _The Power Elite_ was \"vulnerable to\nthe charge of conspiracy-mongering\" but declared that its historical value\n\"seems assured\".[3]In a purposeful extension of Mills' Power Elite, his\nproposed International System, and Comparative Sociology, Muhammed Asadi\n(2012) suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a\ncounterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor\nbased on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic\naccumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose economic\ngrowth stabilizes the World System run by the Command States (counterpart to\nWallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition\nto financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US\nstabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by\nthe Command States and facilitated by them just as suggested by Mills in The\nCauses of World War Three (1958), the preparation for war leads to wars.
