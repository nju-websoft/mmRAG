At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose\n([Michael Schur](/wiki/Michael_Schur \"Michael Schur\")) and Zeke ([Matt\nJones](/wiki/Matt_L._Jones \"Matt L.

The family learns\nthat Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate on the condition that\nthey all come back home to run it. Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting\nit, Fannie and Jeb are unwilling to move back in due to the lack of\nsophistication farm life offers. Nevertheless, Dwight convinces them to help\nhim run the farm.\n\nMeanwhile, [Todd Packer](/wiki/Todd_Packer \"Todd Packer\") ([David\nKoechner](/wiki/David_Koechner \"David Koechner\")) visits the office and\nannounces that he wants to make amends for his past behavior. He makes rude\nremarks masked as apologies and hands out store-bought cupcakes. [Pam\nHalpert](/wiki/Pam_Beesly \"Pam Beesly\") ([Jenna Fischer](/wiki/Jenna_Fischer\n\"Jenna Fischer\")) argues that they should not eat the cupcakes, to spite\nPacker. She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but once\nPam goes home the remaining employees eat the cupcakes. Packer reveals to the\ndocumentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs, supposedly as revenge\nfor getting him fired (though none of the employees present save Nellie had\nanything to do with his being fired). He then visits [Jim\nHalpert](/wiki/Jim_Halpert \"Jim Halpert\") ([John\nKrasinski](/wiki/John_Krasinski \"John Krasinski\")) and [Darryl\nPhilbin](/wiki/Darryl_Philbin \"Darryl Philbin\") ([Craig\nRobinson](/wiki/Craig_Robinson_\\(actor\\) \"Craig Robinson \\(actor\\)\")) at\nAthlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them.

As such, Wilson\nwas initially slated to appear in only 13 episodes of _The Office_ 's ninth\nseason before leaving for the spin-off.[4] Paul Lieberstein, the showrunner\nfor _The Office_ for seasons five through eight, stepped down at the start of\nseason nine in order to focus more energy on the potential spin-off.[5]\nHowever, upon review, the spin-off was not picked up by NBC.[6] Executive\nproducer [Greg Daniels](/wiki/Greg_Daniels \"Greg Daniels\") revealed that the\nepisode would have additional material shot so that it fits better into the\nseason, as the original version contained \"certain aspects that were\nappropriate for a pilot of a new show\".[7]\n\nThe episode guest stars Majandra Delfino, Blake Garrett Rosenthal, [Thomas\nMiddleditch](/wiki/Thomas_Middleditch \"Thomas Middleditch\"), Matt Jones, and\nTom Bower as members of Dwight's family; Delfino plays Dwight's sister Fannie,\nRosenthal plays Dwight's nephew Cammy, Middleditch portrays Dwight's brother\nJeb, Jones portrays Dwight's cousin Zeke, and Bower appears as Dwight's great\nuncle Heinrich, in a deleted scene.[2][6][8] Jones had previously appeared in\nthe ninth season entry, \"[Junior Salesman](/wiki/Junior_Salesman \"Junior\nSalesman\")\".[9]\n\n## Broadcast and\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Farm_\\(The_Office\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Broadcast and reception\")]\n\n###\nRatings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Farm_\\(The_Office\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Ratings\")]\n\n\"The Farm\" originally aired on NBC on March 14, 2013, after a four-week\nhiatus.[10] In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by an\nestimated 3.54 million viewers and received a 1.9 rating/5 percent share.[11]\nThis means that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5\npercent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the\nbroadcast. This marked a decrease in the ratings from the previous episode,\n\"[Moving On](/wiki/Moving_On_\\(The_Office\\) \"Moving On \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\".[11][12] _The Office_ ranked fourth in its timeslot, being beaten\nby an episode of the [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") police procedural _[Person of\nInterest](/wiki/Person_of_Interest_\\(TV_series\\) \"Person of Interest \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ which received a 2.9/8 percent rating, an entry of the\n[ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\")\nseries _[Grey's Anatomy](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy \"Grey's Anatomy\")_ which\nreceived a 2.6/7 percent rating, and an installment of the\n[Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting Company\") series\n_[Glee](/wiki/Glee_\\(TV_series\\) \"Glee \\(TV series\\)\")_ which received a 2.0/6\npercent rating.[11] Despite this, the episode was the highest-rated NBC series\nfor the night.[11] 1.90 million viewers watched the episode via DVR playback,\nbringing the total viewership to 5.36 million viewers and a 3.0 18–49\nrating.[13]\n\n###\nReviews[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Farm_\\(The_Office\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Reviews\")]\n\n\"Then there was the open-endedness of Dwight walking onto the farm with his\nbrother and sister, the beginning of the new life. The tone didn't match. None\nof this was necessarily bad on its own, but because we know what we know, it\ncame off less like a weird outing for Dwight and revealed the stitching of\npeople trying to patch in a standalone episode... which by mere approach made\nit feel larger and grander, the seams of the monster.\"\n\n—Nick Campbell, [TV.com](/wiki/TV.com \"TV.com\")[14]\n\n\"The Farm\" received mostly negative reviews from critics, many criticizing\nDwight's farm storyline and some critics calling it a \"Frankenstein\nepisode\".[14][15] M. Giant of [Television Without\nPity](/wiki/Television_Without_Pity \"Television Without Pity\") awarded the\nepisode a C.[16] [Alan Sepinwall](/wiki/Alan_Sepinwall \"Alan Sepinwall\") of\n_[HitFix](/wiki/HitFix \"HitFix\")_ considered NBC's decision not to pick the\nspin-off for more episodes the right decision, writing that the characters and\nscenes were \"barely sketches\" and featured too much \"cartoonishness\".\nSepinwall also criticized the Todd Packer scenes, and only saw Dwight's\ninteractions with his nephew, Cammy, in a positive light.[17]\n[TV.com](/wiki/TV.com \"TV.com\") columnist Nick Campbell called the farm\nstoryline \"unnatural\" compared to the episode and the series, as a whole, and\nwrote that the tone to the ending \"didn't match\". Despite this, he\ncomplimented the storyline for \"establishing tone, characters, and direction\nin literally half the time usually allotted\".[14] _[The A.V.\nClub](/wiki/The_A.V._Club \"The A.V. Club\")_ reviewer Erik Adams complimented\nthe episode for serving as a \"breather\" from the season's long arcs, and gave\ngood background information into Dwight's personality. He went on to criticize\nthe pilot's broad humor, writing that following the scene featuring Dwight\nshooting a shotgun into his aunt's casket, \"it would be next to impossible for\n_The Farm_ to heighten from that point\". Adams graded the episode a B.[18]\n\nDamon Houx of Screen Crush called the two storylines \"two pieces of that\n[_[sic](/wiki/Sic \"Sic\")_] didn't work all that well together\", which all\nadded to a \"dull\" episode. Houx complimented Koechner's performance, calling\nhim a \"great improviser\" but wrote that the whole plot was lacking. He also\nconsidered the farm plotline to be pointless and aimless, especially due to it\nairing in the last few episodes of the series.[19]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Farm_\\(The_Office\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Wilson, Rainn (December 13, 2012).
