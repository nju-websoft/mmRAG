of\n[England](/wiki/England \"England\").[3][4][5] The [Archbishop of\nCanterbury](/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury \"Archbishop of Canterbury\") is the\nmost senior cleric, although the\n[monarch](/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Monarchy of the United\nKingdom\") is the [supreme\ngovernor](/wiki/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England \"Supreme Governor of\nthe Church of England\"). The Church of England is also the [mother\nchurch](/wiki/Mother_church \"Mother church\") of the international [Anglican\nCommunion](/wiki/Anglican_Communion \"Anglican Communion\"). It traces its\nhistory to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of\nBritain by the third century, and to the 6th-century [Gregorian\nmission](/wiki/Gregorian_mission \"Gregorian mission\") to\n[Kent](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kent \"Kingdom of Kent\") led by [Augustine of\nCanterbury](/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury \"Augustine of Canterbury\").[6][7][8]\n\nThe English church renounced [papal](/wiki/Papal \"Papal\") authority when\n[Henry VIII](/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England \"Henry VIII of England\") failed to\nsecure an [annulment](/wiki/Annulment \"Annulment\") of his marriage to\n[Catherine of Aragon](/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon \"Catherine of Aragon\") in\n1534.[9] The [English Reformation](/wiki/English_Reformation \"English\nReformation\") accelerated under [Edward VI](/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England \"Edward\nVI of England\")'s regents, before a brief [restoration of papal\nauthority](/wiki/Second_Statute_of_Repeal \"Second Statute of Repeal\") under\n[Queen Mary I](/wiki/Mary_I_of_England \"Mary I of England\") and [King\nPhilip](/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain \"Philip II of Spain\"). The [Act of Supremacy\n1558](/wiki/Act_of_Supremacy_1558 \"Act of Supremacy 1558\") renewed the breach\nand the [Elizabethan Settlement](/wiki/Elizabethan_Settlement \"Elizabethan\nSettlement\") charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself\nas both catholic and reformed:\n\n  * _catholic_ in that it views itself as a part of the universal church of [Jesus Christ](/wiki/Jesus_Christ \"Jesus Christ\") in unbroken continuity with the early [apostolic](/wiki/Apostolic_Age \"Apostolic Age\") church. This is expressed in its emphasis on the teachings of the early [Church Fathers](/wiki/Church_Fathers \"Church Fathers\"), as formalised in the [Apostles'](/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed \"Apostles' Creed\"), [Nicene](/wiki/Nicene_Creed \"Nicene Creed\"), and [Athanasian](/wiki/Athanasian_Creed \"Athanasian Creed\") creeds.[10]\n  * _reformed_ in that it has been shaped by some of the doctrinal principles of the 16th-century [Protestant Reformation](/wiki/Protestant_Reformation \"Protestant Reformation\"), in particular in the [Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion](/wiki/Thirty-Nine_Articles_of_Religion \"Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion\") and the [Book of Common Prayer](/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer \"Book of Common Prayer\").[10]\n\nIn the earlier phase of the [English Reformation](/wiki/English_Reformation\n\"English Reformation\") there were both [Catholic\nmartyrs](/wiki/List_of_Catholic_martyrs_of_the_English_Reformation \"List of\nCatholic martyrs of the English Reformation\") and [radical\nProtestant](/wiki/List_of_Protestant_martyrs_of_the_English_Reformation \"List\nof Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation\") martyrs. The later phases\nsaw the [Penal Laws](/wiki/English_Penal_Laws \"English Penal Laws\") punish\nRoman Catholic and [nonconforming Protestants](/wiki/Nonconformist\n\"Nonconformist\"). In the 17th century, the [Puritan](/wiki/Puritan \"Puritan\")\nand [Presbyterian](/wiki/Presbyterian \"Presbyterian\") factions continued to\nchallenge the leadership of the Church which under the Stuarts veered towards\na more catholic interpretation of the Elizabethan Settlement especially under\nArchbishop Laud and the rise of the concept of Anglicanism as the Via Media.\nAfter the victory of the Parliamentarians the Prayer Book was abolished and\nthe Presbyterian and Independent factions dominated. The Episcopacy was\nabolished. The [Restoration](/wiki/Restoration_\\(1660\\) \"Restoration\n\\(1660\\)\") restored the Church of England, episcopacy and the Prayer Book.\nPapal recognition of [George III](/wiki/George_III_of_England \"George III of\nEngland\") in 1766 led to greater religious tolerance.\n\nSince the English Reformation, the Church of England has used a\n[liturgy](/wiki/Liturgy \"Liturgy\") in English. The church contains several\ndoctrinal strands, the main three known as [Anglo-Catholic](/wiki/Anglo-\nCatholic \"Anglo-Catholic\"), [Evangelical](/wiki/Evangelical_Anglicanism\n\"Evangelical Anglicanism\") and [Broad Church](/wiki/Broad_Church \"Broad\nChurch\"). Tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find\nexpression in debates over the [ordination of\nwomen](/wiki/Ordination_of_women_in_the_Anglican_Communion \"Ordination of\nwomen in the Anglican Communion\") and\n[homosexuality](/wiki/Homosexuality_and_Anglicanism \"Homosexuality and\nAnglicanism\"). The church includes both [liberal](/wiki/Liberal_Christianity\n\"Liberal Christianity\") and\n[conservative](/wiki/British_Conservative_Evangelicalism \"British Conservative\nEvangelicalism\") clergy and members.[11]\n\nThe governing structure of the church is based on [dioceses](/wiki/Diocese\n\"Diocese\"), each presided over by a bishop. Within each diocese are local\nparishes. The [General Synod of the Church of\nEngland](/wiki/General_Synod_of_the_Church_of_England \"General Synod of the\nChurch of England\") is the legislative body for the church and comprises\nbishops, other clergy and [laity](/wiki/Laity \"Laity\").

The earliest historical evidence\nof Christianity among the native [Britons](/wiki/Britons_\\(historical\\)\n\"Britons \\(historical\\)\") is found in the writings of such early Christian\nFathers as [Tertullian](/wiki/Tertullian \"Tertullian\") and\n[Origen](/wiki/Origen \"Origen\") in the first years of the [3rd\ncentury](/wiki/Christianity_in_the_3rd_century \"Christianity in the 3rd\ncentury\"). Three [Romano-British](/wiki/Romano-British \"Romano-British\")\nbishops, including [Restitutus](/wiki/Restitutus \"Restitutus\"), are known to\nhave been present at the [Council of Arles in\n314](/wiki/Council_of_Arles_\\(314\\) \"Council of Arles \\(314\\)\").[12] Others\nattended the [Council of Serdica](/wiki/Council_of_Serdica \"Council of\nSerdica\") in 347 and that of [Ariminum](/wiki/Council_of_Ariminum \"Council of\nAriminum\") in 360, and a number of references to the church in [Roman\nBritain](/wiki/Roman_Britain \"Roman Britain\") are found in the writings of\n[4th century](/wiki/Christianity_in_the_4th_century \"Christianity in the 4th\ncentury\") Christian fathers. Britain was the home of [Pelagius](/wiki/Pelagius\n\"Pelagius\"), who opposed [Augustine of Hippo](/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo\n\"Augustine of Hippo\")'s doctrine of [original sin](/wiki/Original_sin\n\"Original sin\").[13]\n\nWhile Christianity was long established as the religion of the Britons at the\ntime of the [Anglo-Saxon invasion](/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_invasion_of_Britain\n\"Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain\"), Christian Britons made little progress in\nconverting the newcomers from their [native paganism](/wiki/Anglo-\nSaxon_paganism \"Anglo-Saxon paganism\"). Consequently, in 597, [Pope Gregory\nI](/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I \"Pope Gregory I\") sent the [prior](/wiki/Prior\n\"Prior\") of the [Abbey of St Andrew's](/wiki/San_Gregorio_Magno_al_Celio \"San\nGregorio Magno al Celio\") (later canonised as [Augustine of\nCanterbury](/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury \"Augustine of Canterbury\")) from\nRome to evangelise the [Angles](/wiki/Angles \"Angles\"). This event is known as\nthe [Gregorian mission](/wiki/Gregorian_mission \"Gregorian mission\") and is\nthe date the Church of England generally marks as the beginning of its formal\nhistory. With the help of Christians already residing in\n[Kent](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kent \"Kingdom of Kent\"), Augustine established his\nchurch at [Canterbury](/wiki/Canterbury \"Canterbury\"), the capital of the\n[Kingdom of Kent](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kent \"Kingdom of Kent\"), and became the\nfirst in the series of [Archbishops of\nCanterbury](/wiki/Archbishops_of_Canterbury \"Archbishops of Canterbury\") in\n598. A later archbishop, the Greek [Theodore of\nTarsus](/wiki/Theodore_of_Tarsus \"Theodore of Tarsus\"), also contributed to\nthe organisation of Christianity in England. The Church of England has been in\ncontinuous existence since the days of St Augustine, with the Archbishop of\nCanterbury as its episcopal head. Despite the various disruptions of the\nReformation and the [English Civil War](/wiki/English_Civil_War \"English Civil\nWar\"), the Church of England considers itself to be the same church which was\nmore formally organised by Augustine.[6]\n\nWhile some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the [Synod of\nWhitby](/wiki/Synod_of_Whitby \"Synod of Whitby\"), the Christian in the British\nIsles was under papal authority from earliest times.[14] Queen [Bertha of\nKent](/wiki/Bertha_of_Kent \"Bertha of Kent\") was among the Christians in\nEngland who recognised papal authority before Augustine arrived,[15] and\nCeltic Christians were carrying out missionary work with papal approval long\nbefore the Synod of Whitby.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Hereford_Cathedral_Interior_May_2004.jpg/220px-\nHereford_Cathedral_Interior_May_2004.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hereford_Cathedral_Interior_May_2004.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hereford_Cathedral_Interior_May_2004.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Hereford](/wiki/Hereford_Cathedral \"Hereford Cathedral\") is one of the\nchurch's 43 cathedrals; many have histories stretching back centuries\n\nThe Synod of Whitby established the Roman date for Easter and the Roman style\nof monastic tonsure in England. This meeting of the ecclesiastics with Roman\ncustoms with local bishops was summoned in 664 at Saint Hilda's double\nmonastery of Streonshalh (Streanæshalch), later called [Whitby\nAbbey](/wiki/Whitby_Abbey \"Whitby Abbey\"). It was presided over by [King\nOswiu](/wiki/Oswiu \"Oswiu\"), who did not engage in the debate but made the\nfinal ruling.\n\n### Separation from\nRome[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Church_of_England&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Separation from Rome\")]\n\nIn 1534, [King Henry VIII](/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England \"Henry VIII of\nEngland\") separated the English Church from Rome.[9] A theological separation\nhad been foreshadowed by various movements within the English Church, such as\n[Lollardy](/wiki/Lollardy \"Lollardy\"), but the English Reformation gained\npolitical support when Henry VIII wanted an [annulment](/wiki/Annulment\n\"Annulment\") of his marriage to [Catherine of\nAragon](/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon \"Catherine of Aragon\") so he could marry\n[Anne Boleyn](/wiki/Anne_Boleyn \"Anne Boleyn\"). [Pope Clement\nVII](/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII \"Pope Clement VII\"), considering that the earlier\nmarriage had been entered under a [papal\ndispensation](/wiki/Dispensation_\\(canon_law\\) \"Dispensation \\(canon law\\)\")\nand how Catherine's nephew, [Emperor Charles\nV](/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor\"), might\nreact to such a move, refused the annulment. Eventually, Henry, although\ntheologically opposed to Protestantism, took the position of [Supreme Head of\nthe Church of England](/wiki/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England\n\"Supreme Governor of the Church of England\") to ensure the annulment of his\nmarriage. He was [excommunicated](/wiki/Excommunicated \"Excommunicated\") by\n[Pope Paul III](/wiki/Pope_Paul_III \"Pope Paul III\").[16]\n\nIn 1536–40 Henry VIII engaged in the [Dissolution of the\nMonasteries](/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries \"Dissolution of the\nMonasteries\"), which controlled much of the richest land. He disbanded\n[monasteries](/wiki/Monastery \"Monastery\"), [priories](/wiki/Priory \"Priory\"),\n[convents](/wiki/Convent \"Convent\") and [friaries](/wiki/Friary \"Friary\") in\nEngland, Wales and Ireland, appropriated their income, disposed of their\nassets, and provided pensions for the former residents. The properties were\nsold to pay for the wars. Bernard argues:\n\n    The dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s was one of the most revolutionary events in English history. There were nearly 900 religious houses in England, around 260 for monks, 300 for regular canons, 142 nunneries and 183 friaries; some 12,000 people in total, 4,000 monks, 3,000 canons, 3,000 friars and 2,000 nuns....one adult man in fifty was in religious orders.[17]\n\nThe population of England at the time is estimated to have been only 2.5\nmillion: half male of whom 750,000 adult. This is one in 75, not 1 in 50.\nHowever the latter figure is creditable if secular clergy are included.\n\nHenry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic practices and,\nduring his reign, Protestant reformers were unable to make many changes to the\npractices of the Church of England. Indeed, this part of Henry's reign saw\ntrials for heresy of Protestants as well as Roman Catholics.\n\nUnder his son, [King Edward VI](/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England \"Edward VI of\nEngland\"), more Protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted. Under the\nleadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury, [Thomas\nCranmer](/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer \"Thomas Cranmer\"), a more radical reformation\nproceeded. A new pattern of worship was set out in the [Book of Common\nPrayer](/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer \"Book of Common Prayer\") (1549 and 1552).\nThese were based on the older liturgy in particular the Prayer Book of 1549,\nbut both influenced by Protestant doctrines such as justification by faith\nalone, the rejection of the sacrifice of the Mass, and the Real Presence\nunderstood as physical presence (Cranmer was Calvinist in that he believed\nChrist was truly and really present in the Eucharist but after a spiritual\nmanner as in a sacrament). The confession of the reformed Church of England\nwas set out in the [Forty-two Articles](/wiki/Forty-two_Articles \"Forty-two\nArticles\") (later revised to thirty-nine). The reformation however was cut\nshort by the death of the king. [Queen Mary I](/wiki/Mary_I_of_England \"Mary I\nof England\"), who succeeded him, returned England again to the authority of\nthe papacy, thereby ending the first attempt at an independent Church of\nEngland.

The three-fold ministry in the Apostolic Succession was maintained;\nthe institutional continuity of the Church was preserved without break (at her\naccession almost all clergy had been ordained in Catholic Orders using the\nRoman Pontifical), although the character of the organization was changed by\nthe adoption of some reformed doctrines and the simplification of the outwards\nforms of worship and the abandonment of traditional vestments and art work;\nthe retention of medieval Canon Law, a much shortened Calendar of Saints and\nliturgical music.

The failure of political and\necclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive\nreform was one of the causes of open warfare. By Continental standards the\nlevel of violence over religion was not high, since the Civil was mainly about\npolitics, but the casualties included King Charles I and the Archbishop of\nCanterbury, [William Laud](/wiki/William_Laud \"William Laud\") and tens of\nthousands of civilians who died from the unsettled conditions. Under the\nCommonwealth and the Protectorate of England from 1649 to 1660, the bishops\nwere dethroned and former practices were outlawed, and\n[Presbyterian](/wiki/Presbyterian_polity \"Presbyterian polity\") ecclesiology\nwas introduced in place of the episcopate. The 39 Articles were replaced by\nthe [Westminster Confession](/wiki/Westminster_Confession \"Westminster\nConfession\"), the Book of Common Prayer by the Directory of Public Worship.\nDespite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this\nform of State Presbyterianism.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/CANTEBURY_ALTAR_HORIZONTAL_7424.jpg/220px-\nCANTEBURY_ALTAR_HORIZONTAL_7424.jpg)](/wiki/File:CANTEBURY_ALTAR_HORIZONTAL_7424.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CANTEBURY_ALTAR_HORIZONTAL_7424.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMajor repairs were done to Canterbury Cathedral after the Restoration in 1660\n\nWith the Restoration of Charles II, Parliament restored the Church of England\nto a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was\nthat the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious\norganisation, taken for granted by the Tudors, had to be abandoned. The\nreligious landscape of England assumed its present form, with the Anglican\nestablished church occupying the middle ground, and those Puritans and\nProtestants who [dissented](/wiki/English_Dissenters \"English Dissenters\")\nfrom the Anglican establishment, having to continue their existence outside\nthe national church rather than trying to influence or trying to gain control\nof it. One result of the Restoration was the ousting of 2,000 parish ministers\nwho had not been ordained by bishops in the Apostolic Succession or had been\nby presbyters (ministers in presbyter's orders). Continuing official suspicion\nand legal restrictions continued well into the 19th century. Roman Catholics,\nperhaps 5% of the English population (down from 20% in 1600) were grudgingly\ntolerated, having had little or no official representation after the Pope's\nexcommunication of Queen Elizabeth in 1570, though the Stuarts were\nsympathetic to them.

In addition, doctrine is also derived from the teachings of the\n[Church Fathers](/wiki/Church_Fathers \"Church Fathers\") and [ecumenical\ncouncils](/wiki/Ecumenical_councils \"Ecumenical councils\") (as well as the\n[ecumenical creeds](/wiki/Ecumenical_creeds \"Ecumenical creeds\")) in so far as\nthese agree with scripture. This doctrine is expressed in the [Thirty-Nine\nArticles of Religion](/wiki/Thirty-Nine_Articles_of_Religion \"Thirty-Nine\nArticles of Religion\"), the [Book of Common\nPrayer](/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer \"Book of Common Prayer\"), and the Ordinal\ncontaining the rites for the ordination of [deacons](/wiki/Deacon#Anglicanism\n\"Deacon\"), [priests](/wiki/Anglican_priest \"Anglican priest\"), and the\nconsecration of bishops.[29] Unlike other traditions, the Church of England\nhas no single theologian that it can look to as a founder. However, [Richard\nHooker](/wiki/Richard_Hooker \"Richard Hooker\")'s appeal to scripture, [church\ntradition](/wiki/Christian_tradition \"Christian tradition\"), and\n[reason](/wiki/Reason \"Reason\") as sources of authority continue to inform\nAnglican identity.[30]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Canterbury_Cathedral_-\n_Portal_Nave_Cross-spire.jpeg/220px-Canterbury_Cathedral_-_Portal_Nave_Cross-\nspire.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Canterbury_Cathedral_-_Portal_Nave_Cross-spire.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Canterbury_Cathedral_-_Portal_Nave_Cross-spire.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Canterbury Cathedral](/wiki/Canterbury_Cathedral \"Canterbury Cathedral\")\nhouses the _[cathedra](/wiki/Cathedra \"Cathedra\")_ or episcopal chair of the\n[Archbishop of Canterbury](/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury \"Archbishop of\nCanterbury\") and is the cathedral of the [Diocese of\nCanterbury](/wiki/Diocese_of_Canterbury \"Diocese of Canterbury\") and the\n[mother church](/wiki/Mother_church \"Mother church\") of the Church of England\nas well as a focus for the [Anglican Communion](/wiki/Anglican_Communion\n\"Anglican Communion\")\n\nThe Church of England's doctrinal character today is largely the result of the\nElizabethan Settlement, which sought to establish a comprehensive middle way\nbetween Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The Church of England affirms the\nProtestant Reformation principle that scripture contains all things necessary\nto salvation and is the final arbiter in doctrinal matters. The Thirty-nine\nArticles are the church's only official confessional statement. Though not a\ncomplete system of doctrine, the articles highlight areas of agreement with\n[Lutheran](/wiki/Lutheran \"Lutheran\") and [Reformed](/wiki/Calvinism\n\"Calvinism\") positions, while differentiating Anglicanism from Roman\nCatholicism and [Anabaptism](/wiki/Anabaptism \"Anabaptism\").[30]\n\nWhile embracing some themes of the Protestant Reformation, the Church of\nEngland also maintains Catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings\nof the Church Fathers, unless these are considered contrary to scripture. It\naccepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the\n[Trinity](/wiki/Trinity \"Trinity\") and the\n[Incarnation](/wiki/Incarnation_\\(Christianity\\) \"Incarnation\n\\(Christianity\\)\"). The Church of England also preserves Catholic Order by\nadhering to [episcopal polity](/wiki/Episcopal_polity \"Episcopal polity\"),\nwith ordained orders of bishops, priests and deacons. There are differences of\nopinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy. Some\nconsider it essential, while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering\nof the church.[30] In sum these express the 'Via Media' viewpoint that the\nfirst five centuries of doctrinal development and church order as approved as\nacceptable be a kind of yardstick by which to gauge authentic catholicity, as\nminimum and sufficient; Anglicanism did not emerge as the result of\ncharismatic leaders with particular doctrines. It is light on details compared\nto Roman Catholic, Reformed and Lutheran teachings. The Bible, the Creeds,\nApostolic Order, and the administration of the Sacraments are sufficient to\nestablish Catholicity. Indeed, not one major doctrinal development emerged\nfrom the English reformation, Diarmid MacCulloch, The Later Reformation in\nEngland, 1990, p. 55. The Reformation in England was initially much concerned\nabout doctrine but the Elizabethan Settlement tried to put a stop to doctrinal\ncontentions. The proponents of further changes, nonetheless, tried to get\ntheir way by making changes in Church Order (abolition of bishops), governance\n(Canon Law) and liturgy ('too Catholic'). They did not succeed because the\nMonarchy, the Church and resisted and the majority of the population were\nindifferent. Moreover, \"despite all the assumptions of the Reformation\nfounders of that Church, it had retained a catholic character.\" The\nElizabethan Settlement had created a cuckoo in a nest...\" a Protestant\ntheology and program within a largely pre-Reformation Catholic structure whose\ncontinuing life would arouse a theological interest in the Catholicism that\nhad created it; and would result in the rejection of predestinarian theology\nin favor of sacraments, especially the eucharist, ceremonial, and anti-\nCalvinist doctrine\" (ibid pp. 78–86). The existence of cathedrals \"without\nsubstantial alteration\" and \"where the \"old devotional world cast its longest\nshadow for the future of the ethos that would become Anglicanism,\" p. 79. This\nis \"One of the great mysteries of the English Reformation,\" ibid that there\nwas no complete break with the past but a muddle that was per force turned\ninto a virtue. The story of the English Reformation is the tale of retreat\nfrom the Protestant advance of 1550 which could not proceed further in the\nface of the opposition of the institution which was rooted in the medieval\npast, ibid. p. 142 and the adamant opposition of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe Church of England has, as one of its distinguishing marks, a breadth and\n\"open-mindedness\". This tolerance has allowed Anglicans who emphasise the\nCatholic tradition and others who emphasise the Reformed tradition to coexist.\nThe three \"parties\" (see [Churchmanship](/wiki/Churchmanship \"Churchmanship\"))\nin the Church of England are sometimes called [high church](/wiki/High_church\n\"High church\") (or [Anglo-Catholic](/wiki/Anglo-Catholic \"Anglo-Catholic\")),\n[low church](/wiki/Low_church \"Low church\") (or [evangelical\nAnglican](/wiki/Evangelical_Anglican \"Evangelical Anglican\")) and [broad\nchurch](/wiki/Broad_church \"Broad church\") (or\n[liberal](/wiki/Liberal_Christianity \"Liberal Christianity\")). The high church\nparty places importance on the Church of England's continuity with the pre-\nReformation Catholic Church, adherence to ancient liturgical usages and the\nsacerdotal nature of the priesthood. As their name suggests, Anglo-Catholics\nmaintain many traditional Catholic practices and liturgical forms.[31] The low\nchurch party is more Protestant in both ceremony and theology.[32]\nHistorically, broad church has been used to describe those of middle-of-the-\nroad ceremonial preferences who lean theologically towards liberal\nProtestantism.[33] The balance between these strands of churchmanship is not\nstatic: in 2013, 40% of Church of England worshippers attended evangelical\nchurches (compared with 26% in 1989), and 83% of very large congregations were\nevangelical. Such churches were also reported to attract higher numbers of men\nand young adults than others.[34]\n\n### Worship and\nliturgy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Church_of_England&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Worship and liturgy\")]\n\nThe Church of England's official book of liturgy as established in English Law\nis the _[Book of Common Prayer](/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer \"Book of Common\nPrayer\")_. In addition to this book the General Synod has also legislated for\na modern [liturgical book](/wiki/Liturgical_book \"Liturgical book\"), _[Common\nWorship](/wiki/Common_Worship \"Common Worship\")_ , dating from 2000, which can\nbe used as an alternative to the BCP. Like its predecessor, the 1980\n_[Alternative Service Book](/wiki/Alternative_Service_Book \"Alternative\nService Book\")_ , it differs from the _Book of Common Prayer_ in providing a\nrange of alternative services, mostly in modern language, although it does\ninclude some BCP-based forms as well, for example Order Two for Holy\nCommunion. (This is a revision of the BCP service, altering some words and\nallowing the insertion of some other liturgical texts such as the _[Agnus\nDei](/wiki/Agnus_Dei_\\(liturgy\\) \"Agnus Dei \\(liturgy\\)\")_ before communion.)\nThe Order One rite follows the pattern of more modern liturgical scholarship.\n\nThe liturgies are organised according to the traditional [liturgical\nyear](/wiki/Liturgical_year \"Liturgical year\") and the [calendar of\nsaints](/wiki/Calendar_of_saints_\\(Church_of_England\\) \"Calendar of saints\n\\(Church of England\\)\"). The [sacraments](/wiki/Anglican_sacraments \"Anglican\nsacraments\") of [baptism](/wiki/Baptism \"Baptism\") and the\n[Eucharist](/wiki/Eucharist \"Eucharist\") are generally thought necessary to\nsalvation. [Infant baptism](/wiki/Infant_baptism \"Infant baptism\") is\npractised. At a later age, individuals baptised as infants receive\n[confirmation](/wiki/Confirmation \"Confirmation\") by a bishop, at which time\nthey reaffirm the baptismal promises made by their parents or sponsors. The\nEucharist, consecrated by a thanksgiving prayer including Christ's [Words of\nInstitution](/wiki/Words_of_Institution \"Words of Institution\"), is believed\nto be \"a memorial of Christ's once-for-all redemptive acts in which Christ is\nobjectively present and effectually received in faith\".[35]\n\nThe use of hymns and [music in the Church of\nEngland](/wiki/Anglican_church_music \"Anglican church music\") has changed\ndramatically over the centuries. Traditional [Choral\nevensong](/wiki/Evening_Prayer_\\(Anglican\\) \"Evening Prayer \\(Anglican\\)\") is\na staple of most cathedrals.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nstyle of [psalm](/wiki/Psalm \"Psalm\") chanting harks back to the Church of\nEngland's pre-reformation roots. During the 18th century, clergy such as\n[Charles Wesley](/wiki/Charles_Wesley \"Charles Wesley\") introduced their own\nstyles of worship with poetic hymns.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the [Charismatic\nMovement](/wiki/Charismatic_Movement \"Charismatic Movement\") significantly\naltered the worship traditions of numerous Church of England parishes,\nprimarily affecting those of [evangelical](/wiki/Evangelical \"Evangelical\")\npersuasion. These churches now adopt a [contemporary\nworship](/wiki/Contemporary_worship \"Contemporary worship\") form of service,\nwith minimal liturgical or ritual elements, and incorporating [contemporary\nworship music](/wiki/Contemporary_worship_music \"Contemporary worship music\").\n\n### Women's\nministry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Church_of_England&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Women's ministry\")]\n\nWomen were appointed as deaconesses from 1861 but they could not function\nfully as deacons and were not considered ordained clergy. Women have been [lay\nreaders](/wiki/Lay_reader \"Lay reader\") for a long time. During the First\nWorld War, some women were appointed as lay readers, known as \"[bishop's\nmessengers](/wiki/Bishop%27s_messenger \"Bishop's messenger\")\", who also led\nmissions and ran churches in the absence of men. After that no more lay\nreaders were appointed until 1969.\n\nLegislation authorising the ordination of women as deacons was passed in 1986\nand they were first ordained in 1987.

In February 2006, the synod voted\noverwhelmingly for the \"further exploration\" of possible arrangements for\nparishes that did not want to be directly under the authority of a bishop who\nis a woman.[37] On 7 July 2008, the synod voted to approve the ordination of\nwomen as bishops and rejected moves for alternative episcopal oversight for\nthose who do not accept the ministry of bishops who are women.[38] Actual\nordinations of women to the episcopate required further legislation, which was\nnarrowly rejected in a vote at General Synod in November 2012.[39][40]\n\nOn 20 November 2013, the General Synod voted overwhelmingly in support of a\nplan to allow the ordination of women as bishops, with 378 in favour, 8\nagainst and 25 abstentions.[41]\n\nOn 14 July 2014, the General Synod approved the ordination of women as\nbishops.

Independent investigators are examining files as far\nback as the 1950s and Welby hopes this independence will prevent any\npossibility of a [cover-up](/wiki/Cover-up \"Cover-up\").[130]\n\n> We will systematically bring those transparently and openly first of all\n> working with the survivors where they are still alive and then seeing what\n> they want. The rule is survivors come first, not our own interests, and\n> however important the person was, however distinguished, however well-known,\n> survivors come first. (Justin Welby)\n\nThe personal files of all Anglican clergy since the 1950s are being audited in\nan effort to ensure no cover-up. Welby emphasised repeatedly that no cover-up\nwould be acceptable.[131]\n\nDespite such assurances there is concern that not enough may be done and\nhistoric abuse may still sometimes be covered up.

I hope that the Archbishop's review into the case of\n> Peter Ball will deal with such bullying and what appears to be the undue\n> influence exerted on the police and CPS by the Church in dealing with this\n> case. The total failure of procedures, outlined by Ian Elliott, echoes that\n> revealed in the totally damning Cahill Report about the conduct of the\n> Archbishop Hope of York in respect of Robert Waddington.

There have also been allegations of [child sex\nabuse](/wiki/Child_sex_abuse \"Child sex abuse\"), for example [Robert\nWaddington](/wiki/Robert_Waddington#Allegations_of_abuse \"Robert Waddington\").\nA complainant, known only as \"Joe\", tried for decades to have action taken\nover sadistic sex abuse which Garth Moore perpetrated against him in 1976 when\n\"Joe\" was 15 years old. None of the high ranking clergy who \"Joe\" spoke to\nrecall being told about the abuse, which \"Joe\" considers incredible.[134] A\nrepresentative of the solicitors firm representing \"Joe\" said:\n\n> The Church of England wants to bury and discourage allegations of non-recent\n> abuse.
