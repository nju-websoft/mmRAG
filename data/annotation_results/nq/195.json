Shelley started writing the story when she\nwas 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London\non 1 January 1818, when she was 20.[1] Her name first appeared on the second\nedition, published in France in 1823.\n\nShelley travelled through Europe in 1814, journeying along the river\n[Rhine](/wiki/Rhine \"Rhine\") in Germany with a stop in\n[Gernsheim](/wiki/Gernsheim \"Gernsheim\") which is 17 kilometres (11 mi) away\nfrom [Frankenstein Castle](/wiki/Frankenstein_Castle \"Frankenstein Castle\"),\nwhere, two centuries before, an [alchemist](/wiki/Alchemist \"Alchemist\") was\nengaged in experiments.[2][3][4] Later, she travelled in the region of\n[Geneva](/wiki/Geneva \"Geneva\") (Switzerland)—where much of the story takes\nplace—and the topic of [galvanism](/wiki/Galvanism \"Galvanism\") and other\nsimilar [occult](/wiki/Occult \"Occult\") ideas were themes of conversation\namong her companions, particularly her lover and future husband, [Percy\nShelley](/wiki/Percy_Shelley \"Percy Shelley\"). Mary, Percy, [Lord\nByron](/wiki/Lord_Byron \"Lord Byron\") and [John Polidori](/wiki/John_Polidori\n\"John Polidori\") decided to have a competition to see who could write the best\n[horror](/wiki/Horror_fiction \"Horror fiction\") story. After thinking for\ndays, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by\nwhat he had made; her dream later evolved into the novel's story.\n\n_Frankenstein_ is infused with elements of the [Gothic\nnovel](/wiki/Gothic_fiction \"Gothic fiction\") and the\n[Romantic](/wiki/Romanticism \"Romanticism\") movement. At the same time, it is\nan early example of [science fiction](/wiki/Science_fiction \"Science\nfiction\"). [Brian Aldiss](/wiki/Brian_Aldiss \"Brian Aldiss\") has argued that\nit should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in\ncontrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of\nlater science fiction, the central character \"makes a deliberate decision\" and\n\"turns to modern experiments in the laboratory\" to achieve fantastic\nresults.[5] It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular\nculture and spawned a complete genre of [horror](/wiki/Horror_fiction \"Horror\nfiction\") stories, films and plays.\n\nSince the novel's publication, the name \"Frankenstein\" has often been used to\nrefer to the monster itself. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but\nusage commentators regard it as well-established and acceptable.[6][7][8] In\nthe novel, the monster is identified by words such as \"creature\", \"monster\",\n\"demon\", \"wretch\", \"abortion\", \"fiend\" and \"it\". Speaking to Victor\nFrankenstein, the wretch refers to himself as \"the Adam of your labours\", and\nelsewhere as someone who \"would have [been] your Adam\", but is instead \"your\nfallen angel\" (which ties to [Lucifer](/wiki/Lucifer \"Lucifer\") in _[Paradise\nLost](/wiki/Paradise_Lost \"Paradise Lost\")_ , which the monster reads, and\nwhich relates to the disobedience of [Prometheus](/wiki/Prometheus\n\"Prometheus\") in the book's subtitle).\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Summary\n    * 1.1 Captain Walton's Introductory Frame Narrative\n    * 1.2 Victor Frankenstein's Narrative\n    * 1.3 The Creature's Narrative\n    * 1.4 Victor Frankenstein's Narrative Resumes\n    * 1.5 Captain Walton's Concluding Frame Narrative\n  * 2 Characters\n  * 3 Composition\n  * 4 Publication\n  * 5 Frankenstein and the Monster\n    * 5.1 The Creature\n    * 5.2 Victor Frankenstein's Surname\n    * 5.3 Victor Frankenstein's Given Name\n    * 5.4 Modern Prometheus\n  * 6 Shelley's sources\n  * 7 Reception\n  * 8 Derivative works\n  * 9 Films, plays and television\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 Notes\n  * 12 References\n  * 13 Further reading\n    * 13.1 Editions\n      * 13.1.1 1818 text\n      * 13.1.2 1831 text\n  * 14 External links\n\n## Summary\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Editions_of_Frankenstein.jpg/220px-\nEditions_of_Frankenstein.jpg)](/wiki/File:Editions_of_Frankenstein.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Editions_of_Frankenstein.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA variety of different editions\n\n_Frankenstein_ is written in the form of a [frame story](/wiki/Frame_story\n\"Frame story\") that starts with Captain Robert Walton writing letters to his\nsister. It takes place at an unspecified time in the 18th century, as the\nletters' dates are given as \"17—\".\n\n### Captain Walton's Introductory Frame Narrative\n\nThe novel _Frankenstein_ is written in [epistolary\nform](/wiki/Epistolary_novel \"Epistolary novel\"), documenting a fictional\ncorrespondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret Walton\nSaville. Walton is a failed writer and captain who sets out to explore the\n[North Pole](/wiki/North_Pole \"North Pole\") and expand his scientific\nknowledge in hopes of achieving fame. During the voyage, the crew spots a dog\nsled driven by a gigantic figure. A few hours later, the crew rescues a nearly\nfrozen and emaciated man named [Victor Frankenstein](/wiki/Victor_Frankenstein\n\"Victor Frankenstein\"). Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man\nobserved by Walton's crew. Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion;\nhe sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him, and recounts a\nstory of his life's miseries to Walton as a warning. The recounted story\nserves as the frame for Frankenstein's narrative.\n\n### Victor Frankenstein's Narrative\n\nVictor begins by telling of his childhood. Born in [Naples](/wiki/Naples\n\"Naples\"), into a wealthy [Genevan](/wiki/Geneva \"Geneva\") family, Victor and\nhis brothers, Ernest and William, all three being sons of Alphonse\nFrankenstein by the former Caroline Beaufort, are encouraged to seek a greater\nunderstanding of the world through chemistry. As a young boy, Victor is\nobsessed with studying outdated theories that focus on simulating natural\nwonders. When Victor is five years old, his parents adopt [Elizabeth\nLavenza](/wiki/Elizabeth_Lavenza \"Elizabeth Lavenza\"), the orphaned daughter\nof an expropriated Italian nobleman, with whom Victor later falls in love.\nDuring this period, Victor's parents, Alphonse and Caroline, take in yet\nanother orphan, Justine Moritz, who becomes William's nanny.\n\nWeeks before he leaves for the [University of\nIngolstadt](/wiki/University_of_Ingolstadt \"University of Ingolstadt\") in\nGermany, his mother dies of [scarlet fever](/wiki/Scarlet_fever \"Scarlet\nfever\"); Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief. At\nthe university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences, soon developing a\nsecret technique to impart life to non-living matter. Eventually, he\nundertakes the creation of a humanoid, but due to the difficulty in\nreplicating the minute parts of the human body, Victor makes the Creature\ntall, about 8 feet (2.4 m) in height and proportionally large. Despite his\nintentions, the beautiful creation of his dreams is instead hideous, with\nyellow eyes and skin that barely conceals the muscle tissue and blood vessels\nunderneath. Repulsed by his work, Victor flees and dismisses him when it\nawakens. While wandering the streets, he meets his childhood friend, Henry\nClerval, and takes Henry back to his apartment, fearful of Henry's reaction if\nhe sees the monster. Victor does not have to deal with that issue, however,\nbecause the monster has escaped.\n\nVictor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry.\nAfter a four-month recovery, he returns home when he learns of the murder of\nhis brother William. Upon arriving in Geneva, Victor sees the Creature near\nthe crime scene and climbing a mountain, leading him to believe his creation\nis responsible. Justine Moritz, William's nanny, is convicted of the crime\nafter William's locket, which had contained a miniature portrait of Caroline,\nis found in her pocket. Victor is helpless to stop her from being hanged, as\nhe knows no one would believe his story.\n\nRavaged by grief and guilt, Victor retreats into the mountains. The Creature\nfinds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale.\n\n### The Creature's Narrative\n\nIntelligent and articulate, the Creature relates his first days of life,\nliving alone in the wilderness and finding that people were afraid of and\nhated him due to his appearance, which led him to fear and hide from them.\nWhile living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage, he grew fond of\nthe poor family living there, and discreetly collected firewood for them.\nSecretly living among the family for months, the Creature learned to speak by\nlistening to them and he taught himself to read after discovering a lost\nsatchel of books in the woods. When he saw his reflection in a pool, he\nrealized his physical appearance was hideous, and it terrified him as it\nterrifies normal humans. Nevertheless, he approached the family in hopes of\nbecoming their friend. Initially he was able to befriend the blind father\nfigure of the family, but the rest of them were frightened and they all fled\ntheir home, resulting in the Creature burning the cottage in a fit of rage. He\nthen swore revenge on his creator for bringing him into a world that hated\nhim. He traveled to Victor's family estate using details from Victor's\njournal, murdered William, and framed Justine.\n\nThe Creature demands that Victor create a female companion like himself. He\nargues that as a living being, he has a right to happiness. The Creature\npromises that he and his mate will vanish into the South American wilderness,\nnever to reappear, if Victor grants his request. Should Victor refuse his\nrequest, The Creature also threatens to kill Victor's remaining friends and\nloved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him.\n\nFearing for his family, Victor reluctantly agrees. The Creature says he will\nwatch over Victor's progress.\n\n### Victor Frankenstein's Narrative Resumes\n\nClerval accompanies him to [England](/wiki/England \"England\"), but they\nseparate at Victor's insistence at [Perth](/wiki/Perth,_Scotland \"Perth,\nScotland\"), [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\"). Victor suspects that the\nCreature is following him. Working on the female creature on the [Orkney\nIslands](/wiki/Orkney \"Orkney\"), he is plagued by premonitions of disaster,\nsuch as the female hating the Creature or becoming more evil than him, but\nmore particularly the two creatures might lead to the breeding of a race that\ncould plague mankind. He tears apart the unfinished female creature after he\nsees the Creature, who had indeed followed Victor, watching through a window.\nThe Creature later confronts and tries to threaten Victor into working again,\nbut Victor is convinced that the Creature is evil and that its mate would be\nevil as well, and the pair would threaten all humanity. Victor destroys his\nwork and the Creature vows that he will \"be with [him] on [his] wedding\nnight\". Victor interprets this as a threat upon his life, believing that the\nCreature will kill him after finally becoming happy. When Victor lands in\n[Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\"), he is soon imprisoned for Clerval's\nmurder, as the Creature had strangled Clerval to death and left the corpse to\nbe found where his creator had arrived, causing the latter to suffer another\nmental breakdown in prison. After being acquitted, Victor returns home with\nhis father, who has restored to Elizabeth some of her father's fortune.\n\nIn Geneva, Victor is about to marry Elizabeth and prepares to fight the\nCreature to the death, arming himself with pistols and a dagger. The night\nfollowing their wedding, Victor asks Elizabeth to stay in her room while he\nlooks for \"the fiend\". While Victor searches the house and grounds, the\nCreature strangles Elizabeth to death. From the window, Victor sees the\nCreature, who tauntingly points at Elizabeth's corpse; Victor tries to shoot\nhim, but the Creature escapes. After getting back to Geneva, Victor's father,\nweakened by age and by the death of his precious Elizabeth, dies a few days\nlater. Seeking revenge, Victor pursues the Creature to the [North\nPole](/wiki/North_Pole \"North Pole\"), but collapses from exhaustion and\n[hypothermia](/wiki/Hypothermia \"Hypothermia\") before he can find his quarry.\n\n### Captain Walton's Concluding Frame Narrative\n\nAt the end of Victor's narrative, Captain Walton resumes the telling of the\nstory, closing the frame around Victor's recounting. A few days after the\nCreature vanished, the ship becomes trapped in [pack ice](/wiki/Pack_ice \"Pack\nice\") and multiple crewmen die in the cold, before the rest of Walton's crew\ninsists on returning south once it is freed. Walton sees Victor's story as a\nwarning, and decides to turn the ship around.\n\nVictor dies shortly thereafter, but not before telling Walton to \"avoid\nambition\". Walton discovers the Creature on his ship, mourning over Victor's\nbody. The Creature tells Walton that Victor's death has not brought him peace;\nrather, his crimes have left him completely alone. The Creature vows to kill\nhimself so that no others will ever know of his existence. Walton watches as\nthe Creature drifts away on an ice raft that is soon lost in darkness and\ndistance, never to be seen again.\n\n## Characters\n\n  * **[Victor Frankenstein](/wiki/Victor_Frankenstein \"Victor Frankenstein\")** \\- Protagonist and narrator of most of the story.

The weather was\nconsistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday\nactivities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn.\n\nSitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by\nreading German ghost stories translated into French from the book\n_[Fantasmagoriana](/wiki/Fantasmagoriana \"Fantasmagoriana\")_ ,[11] then Byron\nproposed that they \"each write a ghost story\".[12] Unable to think of a story,\nyoung Mary became anxious: \"_Have you thought of a story?_ I was asked each\nmorning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying\nnegative.\"[13] During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions\nturned to the nature of the principle of life. \"Perhaps a corpse would be re-\nanimated\", Mary noted, \"[galvanism](/wiki/Galvanism \"Galvanism\") had given\ntoken of such things\".[14] It was after midnight before they retired, and\nunable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the\n_grim terrors_ of her \"waking dream\".[15]\n\n> I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had\n> put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then,\n> on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an\n> uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful\n> would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism\n> of the Creator of the world.[16]\n\nIn September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva\nvilla the previous year, and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and\nstars, concluded that her \"waking dream\" took place \"between 2 a.m. and 3\na.m.\" on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that\nthey each write a ghost story.[17]\n\nShe began writing what she assumed would be a short story. With Percy\nShelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a full-fledged novel.[18]\nShe later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment \"when I first\nstepped out from childhood into life\".[19] Shelley wrote the first four\nchapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half-sister Fanny.[20] This\nwas one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's\nfirst child died in infancy, and when she began composing _Frankenstein_ in\n1816, she was likely nursing her second child, who would also be dead at\n_Frankenstein_ 's publication.[21]\n\nByron managed to write just a fragment based on the [vampire](/wiki/Vampire\n\"Vampire\") legends he heard while travelling the [Balkans](/wiki/Balkans\n\"Balkans\"), and from this [John Polidori](/wiki/John_Polidori \"John Polidori\")\ncreated _[The Vampyre](/wiki/The_Vampyre \"The Vampyre\")_ (1819), the\nprogenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two legendary horror\ntales originated from the conclave.\n\nThe group talked about [Enlightenment](/wiki/Enlightenment_\\(philosophy\\)\n\"Enlightenment \\(philosophy\\)\") and [Counter-Enlightenment](/wiki/Counter-\nEnlightenment \"Counter-Enlightenment\") ideas as well. Shelley believed the\nEnlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders\nused their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal\nthat misused power could destroy society (Bennett 36–42).[22]\n\nMary's and Percy Bysshe Shelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume\nedition in 1818 (written 1816–1817), as well as Mary Shelley's fair copy for\nher publisher, are now housed in the [Bodleian Library](/wiki/Bodleian_Library\n\"Bodleian Library\") in [Oxford](/wiki/Oxford \"Oxford\"). The Bodleian acquired\nthe papers in 2004, and they belong now to the [Abinger](/wiki/Baron_Abinger\n\"Baron Abinger\") Collection.[23] In 2008, the Bodleian published a new edition\nof _Frankenstein_ , edited by Charles E. Robinson, that contains comparisons\nof Mary Shelley's original text with Percy Shelley's additions and\ninterventions alongside.[24]\n\n## Publication\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley_Rothwell.tif/lossy-\npage1-220px-\nMary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley_Rothwell.tif.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley_Rothwell.tif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley_Rothwell.tif \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Mary Shelley](/wiki/Mary_Shelley \"Mary Shelley\") by [Richard\nRothwell](/wiki/Richard_Rothwell \"Richard Rothwell\") (1840–41)\n\nShelley completed her writing in April/May 1817, and _Frankenstein; or, The\nModern Prometheus_ was published on 1 January 1818[25] by the small London\npublishing house Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, & Jones.[26][27] It was\nissued anonymously, with a preface written for Mary by [Percy Bysshe\nShelley](/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley \"Percy Bysshe Shelley\") and with a\ndedication to philosopher [William Godwin](/wiki/William_Godwin \"William\nGodwin\"), her father. It was published in an edition of just 500 copies in\nthree volumes, the standard \"[triple-decker](/wiki/Three-volume_novel \"Three-\nvolume novel\")\" format for 19th-century first editions.\n\nThe second edition of _Frankenstein_ was published on 11 August 1822 in two\nvolumes (by G. and W. B. Whittaker) following the success of the stage play\n_Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein_ by [Richard Brinsley\nPeake](/wiki/Richard_Brinsley_Peake \"Richard Brinsley Peake\").[28] This\nedition credited Mary Shelley as the book's author on its title page.\n\nOn 31 October 1831, the first \"popular\" edition in one-volume appeared,\npublished by [Henry Colburn](/wiki/Henry_Colburn \"Henry Colburn\") & Richard\nBentley.[29] This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley, partially to\nmake the story less radical. It included a lengthy new preface by the author,\npresenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story. This\nedition is the one most widely published and read now, although a few editions\nfollow the 1818 text.[30] Some scholars prefer the original version, arguing\nthat it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley's vision (see Anne K. Mellor's\n\"Choosing a Text of _Frankenstein_ to Teach\" in the [W. W.\nNorton](/wiki/W._W._Norton \"W. W. Norton\") Critical edition).\n\nIn 2008, a new edition of the novel, titled _The Original Frankenstein_ ,\nedited by Charles E. Robinson, was published. Robinson examined the original\nmanuscript by Mary Shelley and noted the edits that Percy Bysshe Shelley made\nto it.[31]\n\n## Frankenstein and the Monster\n\n### The Creature\n\nMain article: [Frankenstein's monster](/wiki/Frankenstein%27s_monster\n\"Frankenstein's monster\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Punch_Anti-\nIrish_propaganda_%281882%29_Irish_Frankenstein.jpg/170px-Punch_Anti-\nIrish_propaganda_%281882%29_Irish_Frankenstein.jpg)](/wiki/File:Punch_Anti-\nIrish_propaganda_\\(1882\\)_Irish_Frankenstein.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Punch_Anti-Irish_propaganda_\\(1882\\)_Irish_Frankenstein.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nAn English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish [Fenian\nmovement](/wiki/Fenian \"Fenian\") as akin to Frankenstein's creature, in the\nwake of the [Phoenix Park murders](/wiki/Phoenix_Park_murders \"Phoenix Park\nmurders\").  \nIllustration from an 1882 issue of _[Punch](/wiki/Punch_\\(magazine\\) \"Punch\n\\(magazine\\)\")_[32]\n\nPart of Frankenstein's rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not\ngive it a name, which causes a lack of identity. Instead it is referred to by\nwords such as \"wretch\", \"monster\", \"creature\", \"demon\", \"devil\", \"fiend\", and\n\"it\". When Frankenstein converses with the creature in Chapter 10, he\naddresses it as \"vile insect\", \"abhorred monster\", \"fiend\", \"wretched devil\",\nand \"abhorred devil\".\n\nDuring a telling of Frankenstein, Shelley referred to the creature as\n\"[Adam](/wiki/Adam \"Adam\")\".[33][_[not in citation\ngiven](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_] Shelley was\nreferring to the [first\nman](/wiki/List_of_first_men_or_women_in_mythology_and_religion \"List of first\nmen or women in mythology and religion\") in the [Garden of\nEden](/wiki/Garden_of_Eden \"Garden of Eden\"), as in her epigraph:\n\n    Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay\n    To mould Me man? Did I solicit thee\n    From darkness to promote me? \n\n    [John Milton](/wiki/John_Milton \"John Milton\"), _[Paradise Lost](/wiki/Paradise_Lost \"Paradise Lost\")_ (X. 743–5)\n\nAlthough the creature would be described in later works as a composite of\nwhole body parts grafted together from cadavers and\n[reanimated](/wiki/Reanimation_\\(science_fiction\\) \"Reanimation \\(science\nfiction\\)\") by the use of electricity, this description is not entirely\nconsistent with Shelley's work; both the use of electricity and the cobbled-\ntogether image of Frankenstein's monster were more the result of [James\nWhale](/wiki/James_Whale \"James Whale\")'s popular 1931 [film adaptation of the\nstory](/wiki/Frankenstein_\\(1931_film\\) \"Frankenstein \\(1931 film\\)\"), and\nother early motion-picture works based upon the creature. In Shelley's\noriginal work, Dr. Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental\nprinciple of life, and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue\nvitality into inanimate matter, though the exact nature of the process is left\nlargely ambiguous. After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power,\nFrankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature's body\n(one anatomical feature at a time, from raw materials supplied by \"the\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house\"), which he then brings to life using\nhis unspecified process.\n\nThe creature has often been mistakenly called \"Frankenstein\". In 1908 one\nauthor said \"It is strange to note how well-nigh universally the term\n\"Frankenstein\" is misused, even by intelligent people, as describing some\nhideous monster\".[34] [Edith Wharton](/wiki/Edith_Wharton \"Edith Wharton\")'s\n_[The Reef](/wiki/The_Reef_\\(novel\\) \"The Reef \\(novel\\)\")_ (1916) describes\nan unruly child as an \"infant Frankenstein.\"[35] [David\nLindsay](/wiki/David_Lindsay_\\(novelist\\) \"David Lindsay \\(novelist\\)\")'s \"The\nBridal Ornament\", published in _The Rover_ , 12 June 1844, mentioned \"the\nmaker of poor Frankenstein.\" After the release of Whale's cinematic\n_Frankenstein_ , the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as\n\"Frankenstein\". This also occurs in Frankenstein films, including _[Bride of\nFrankenstein](/wiki/Bride_of_Frankenstein \"Bride of Frankenstein\")_ (1935) and\nseveral subsequent films, as well as in film titles such as _[Abbott and\nCostello Meet Frankenstein](/wiki/Abbott_and_Costello_Meet_Frankenstein\n\"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\")_. Furthermore, future renditions and\nadaptations of the story include an evil laboratory assistant\n[Igor](/wiki/Igor_\\(character\\) \"Igor \\(character\\)\") or Ygor, who does not\nactually exist within the original narrative.\n\n### Victor Frankenstein's Surname\n\nMary Shelley maintained that she derived the name _Frankenstein_ from a dream-\nvision. Despite her public claims of originality, however, a number of other\nsources have been suggested as Shelley's actual inspiration. The German name\n_Frankenstein_ means \"stone of the [Franks](/wiki/Franks \"Franks\")\", and it is\nassociated with various places in Germany, including [Frankenstein\nCastle](/wiki/Frankenstein_Castle \"Frankenstein Castle\") (_Burg Frankenstein_)\nin [Darmstadt](/wiki/Darmstadt \"Darmstadt\"), [Hesse](/wiki/Hesse \"Hesse\"), and\nFrankenstein Castle in [Frankenstein](/wiki/Frankenstein,_Rhineland-Palatinate\n\"Frankenstein, Rhineland-Palatinate\"), a town in the\n[Palatinate](/wiki/Palatinate_\\(region\\) \"Palatinate \\(region\\)\"). There is\nalso a castle called Frankenstein in [Bad Salzungen](/wiki/Bad_Salzungen \"Bad\nSalzungen\"), Thuringia, and a municipality called\n[Frankenstein](/wiki/Frankenstein,_Saxony \"Frankenstein, Saxony\") in Saxony.\nUntil 1945, [Ząbkowice Śląskie](/wiki/Z%C4%85bkowice_%C5%9Al%C4%85skie\n\"Ząbkowice Śląskie\"), now a city in [Lower Silesian\nVoivodeship](/wiki/Lower_Silesian_Voivodeship \"Lower Silesian Voivodeship\"),\n[Poland](/wiki/Poland \"Poland\"), was mainly populated by\n[Germans](/wiki/Germans \"Germans\") and named _Frankenstein_ in German, and was\nthe site of a [scandal involving\ngravediggers](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afera_grabarzy_z_Frankenstein\n\"pl:Afera grabarzy z Frankenstein\") in 1606, which has been suggested as an\ninspiration to the author.[36] Finally, the name is borne by the aristocratic\n[House of Franckenstein](/wiki/House_of_Franckenstein \"House of\nFranckenstein\") from [Franconia](/wiki/Franconia \"Franconia\").\n\n[Radu Florescu](/wiki/Radu_Florescu \"Radu Florescu\") argues that Mary and\nPercy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in 1814 during their\nreturn to England from their elopement to Switzerland. It was at this castle\nthat a notorious alchemist, [Conrad Dippel](/wiki/Johann_Conrad_Dippel \"Johann\nConrad Dippel\"), had experimented with human bodies, and Florescu reasons that\nMary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of\noriginality.[37] A literary essay by A. J. Day supports Florescu's position\nthat Mary Shelley knew of and visited Frankenstein Castle before writing her\ndebut novel.[38] Day includes details of an alleged description of the\nFrankenstein castle that exists in Mary Shelley's 'lost' journals. According\nto Jörg Heléne, the 'lost journals', as well as Florescu's claims, cannot be\nverified.[39]\n\n### Victor Frankenstein's Given Name\n\nMain article: [Victor Frankenstein](/wiki/Victor_Frankenstein \"Victor\nFrankenstein\")\n\nA possible interpretation of the name Victor is derived from _[Paradise\nLost](/wiki/Paradise_Lost \"Paradise Lost\")_ by [John Milton](/wiki/John_Milton\n\"John Milton\"), a great influence on Shelley (a quotation from _Paradise Lost_\nis on the opening page of _Frankenstein_ and Shelley even has the monster\nhimself read it).[40][41] Milton frequently refers to God as \"the Victor\" in\n_Paradise Lost_ , and Shelley sees Victor as playing God by creating life. In\naddition, Shelley's portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of\n[Satan](/wiki/Satan \"Satan\") in _Paradise Lost_ ; indeed, the monster says,\nafter reading the epic poem, that he empathizes with Satan's role in the\nstory.\n\nThere are many similarities between Victor and Percy Shelley, Mary's husband.\nVictor was a pen name of Percy Shelley's, as in the collection of poetry he\nwrote with his sister Elizabeth, _[Original Poetry by Victor and\nCazire](/wiki/Original_Poetry_by_Victor_and_Cazire \"Original Poetry by Victor\nand Cazire\")_.[42] There is speculation that one of Mary Shelley's models for\nVictor Frankenstein was Percy, who at Eton had \"experimented with electricity\nand magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions\", and\nwhose rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment.[43]\n\nPercy Shelley was the first-born son of a wealthy country squire with strong\npolitical connections and a descendant of Sir [Bysshe\nShelley](/wiki/Bysshe_Shelley \"Bysshe Shelley\"), 1st Baronet of [Castle\nGoring](/wiki/Castle_Goring \"Castle Goring\"), and Richard Fitzalan, 10th [Earl\nof Arundel](/wiki/Earl_of_Arundel \"Earl of Arundel\").[44] Victor's family is\none of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were\ncounselors and [syndics](/wiki/Syndic \"Syndic\"). Percy had a sister named\nElizabeth; Victor had an adopted sister named Elizabeth.\n\nOn 22 February 1815, Mary Shelley gave birth to a baby two months prematurely,\nand the baby died two weeks later. Percy did not care about the condition of\nthis premature infant and left with Claire, Mary's stepsister, for a lurid\naffair.[45] When Victor saw the creature come to life he fled the apartment,\nthough the newborn creature approached him, as a child would a parent. The\nquestion of Victor's responsibility to the creature is one of the main themes\nof the book.\n\n### Modern Prometheus\n\n_The Modern Prometheus_ is the novel's subtitle (though some modern editions\nnow drop the subtitle, mentioning it only in an introduction).[46]\n[Prometheus](/wiki/Prometheus \"Prometheus\"), in later versions of Greek\nmythology, was the [Titan](/wiki/Titan_\\(mythology\\) \"Titan \\(mythology\\)\")\nwho created mankind at the behest of [Zeus](/wiki/Zeus \"Zeus\"). He made a\nbeing in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it.[47]\nPrometheus taught man to hunt, read, and heal their sick, but after he tricked\nZeus into accepting poor-quality offerings from humans, Zeus kept fire from\nmankind. Prometheus, being the creator, took back the fire from Zeus to give\nto man. When Zeus discovered this, he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally\npunished by fixing him to a rock of [Caucasus](/wiki/Caucasus \"Caucasus\"),\nwhere each day an eagle would peck out his liver, only for the liver to regrow\nthe next day because of his immortality as a god. He was intended to suffer\nalone for eternity, but eventually [Heracles](/wiki/Heracles \"Heracles\")\n([Hercules](/wiki/Hercules \"Hercules\")) released him.\n\nPrometheus was also a myth told in Latin, but was a very different story. In\nthis version Prometheus makes man from clay and water, again a very relevant\ntheme to _Frankenstein_ , as Victor rebels against the laws of nature (how\nlife is naturally made) and as a result is punished by his creation.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Frankenstein1910.jpg/220px-\nFrankenstein1910.jpg)](/wiki/File:Frankenstein1910.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Frankenstein1910.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIn 1910, [Edison Studios](/wiki/Edison_Studios \"Edison Studios\") released the\n[first motion-picture adaptation](/wiki/Frankenstein_\\(1910_film\\)\n\"Frankenstein \\(1910 film\\)\") of Shelley's story.\n\nThe Titan in the Greek mythology of Prometheus parallels Victor Frankenstein.\nVictor's work by creating man by new means reflects the same innovative work\nof the Titan in creating humans.\n\nSome have argued that Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as\nsomething of a devil, and blamed him for bringing fire to man and thereby\nseducing the human race to the vice of eating meat (fire brought cooking which\nbrought hunting and killing).[48]\n\nByron was particularly attached to the play _[Prometheus\nBound](/wiki/Prometheus_Bound \"Prometheus Bound\")_ by\n[Aeschylus](/wiki/Aeschylus \"Aeschylus\"), and Percy Shelley would soon write\nhis own _[Prometheus Unbound](/wiki/Prometheus_Unbound_\\(Shelley\\) \"Prometheus\nUnbound \\(Shelley\\)\")_ (1820). The term \"Modern Prometheus\" was actually\ncoined by [Immanuel Kant](/wiki/Immanuel_Kant \"Immanuel Kant\") in reference to\n[Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\") and his\nexperiments with electricity.[49]\n\n## Shelley's sources\n\nShelley incorporated a number of different sources into her work, one of which\nwas the [Promethean](/wiki/Prometheus \"Prometheus\") myth from\n[Ovid](/wiki/Ovid \"Ovid\"). The influence of [John Milton](/wiki/John_Milton\n\"John Milton\")'s _[Paradise Lost](/wiki/Paradise_Lost \"Paradise Lost\")_ , and\n[Samuel Taylor Coleridge](/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge \"Samuel Taylor\nColeridge\")'s _[The Rime of the Ancient\nMariner](/wiki/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner \"The Rime of the Ancient\nMariner\")_ , are also clearly evident within the novel. Mary is likely to have\nacquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character from [Humphry\nDavy](/wiki/Humphry_Davy \"Humphry Davy\")'s book _Elements of Chemical\nPhilosophy_ , in which he had written that \"science has ... bestowed upon man\npowers which may be called creative; which have enabled him to change and\nmodify the beings around him ...\". References to the [French\nRevolution](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French Revolution\") run through the\nnovel; a possible source may lie in [François-Félix\nNogaret](/w/index.php?title=Fran%C3%A7ois-F%C3%A9lix_Nogaret&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"François-Félix Nogaret \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n([fr](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-F%C3%A9lix_Nogaret\n\"fr:François-Félix Nogaret\"))'s _Le Miroir des événemens actuels, ou la Belle\nau plus offrant_ (1790): a political parable about scientific progress\nfeaturing an inventor named Frankésteïn who creates a life-sized\nautomaton.[50]\n\nWithin the past thirty years or so, many writers and historians have attempted\nto associate several then popular natural philosophers (now called physical\nscientists) with Shelley's work on account of several notable similarities.\nTwo of the most notable natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries\nwere [Giovanni Aldini](/wiki/Giovanni_Aldini \"Giovanni Aldini\"), who made many\npublic attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in\nLondon[51] and [Johann Konrad Dippel](/wiki/Johann_Konrad_Dippel \"Johann\nKonrad Dippel\"), who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend\nthe life span of humans. While Shelley was obviously aware of both these men\nand their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their\nexperiments in any of her published or released notes.\n\n## Reception\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Frontispiece_to_Frankenstein_1831.jpg/170px-\nFrontispiece_to_Frankenstein_1831.jpg)](/wiki/File:Frontispiece_to_Frankenstein_1831.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Frontispiece_to_Frankenstein_1831.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIllustration by [Theodor von Holst](/wiki/Theodor_von_Holst \"Theodor von\nHolst\") from the frontispiece of the 1831 edition[52]\n\n_Frankenstein_ has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous\npublication in 1818. Critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two\nviews, along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author. [The\nBelle Assemblee](/wiki/Belle_Assemblee \"Belle Assemblee\") described the novel\nas \"very bold fiction\" (139). The _Quarterly Review_ stated that \"the author\nhas the power of both conception and language\" (185). [Sir Walter\nScott](/wiki/Sir_Walter_Scott \"Sir Walter Scott\"), writing in _[Blackwood's\nEdinburgh Magazine](/wiki/Blackwood%27s_Magazine \"Blackwood's Magazine\")_\ncongratulated \"the author's original genius and happy power of expression\"\n(620), although he is less convinced about the way in which the monster gains\nknowledge about the world and language.[53] The _Edinburgh Magazine_ and\n_Literary Miscellany_ hoped to see \"more productions from this author\" (253).\nOn the other hand, the _[Quarterly Review](/wiki/Quarterly_Review \"Quarterly\nReview\")_ described it \"a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity\".[54]\n\nIn two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of William\nGodwin, the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of\nMary Shelley. The _[British Critic](/wiki/British_Critic \"British Critic\")_\nattacks the novel's flaws as the fault of the author: \"The writer of it is, we\nunderstand, a female; this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing\nfault of the novel; but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex,\nit is no reason why we should; and we shall therefore dismiss the novel\nwithout further comment\" (438). _The Literary Panorama and National Register_\nattacks the novel as a \"feeble imitation of Mr. Godwin's novels\" produced by\nthe \"daughter of a celebrated living novelist\" (414). Despite the reviews,\n_Frankenstein_ achieved an almost immediate popular success. It became widely\nknown especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations—Mary Shelley saw\na production of _Presumption; or The Fate of Frankenstein_ , a play by\n[Richard Brinsley Peake](/wiki/Richard_Brinsley_Peake \"Richard Brinsley\nPeake\"), in 1823. A French translation appeared as early as 1821\n(_Frankenstein: ou le Prométhée Moderne_ , translated by Jules Saladin).\n\nCritical reception of _Frankenstein_ has been largely positive since the\nmid-20th century.[55] Major critics such as M. A. Goldberg and [Harold\nBloom](/wiki/Harold_Bloom \"Harold Bloom\") have praised the \"aesthetic and\nmoral\" relevance of the novel,[56] although there are also critics such as\n[Germaine Greer](/wiki/Germaine_Greer \"Germaine Greer\"), who criticized the\nnovel as terrible due to technical and narrative defects (such as it featuring\nthree narrators that speak in the same way).[57] In more recent years the\nnovel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist\ncriticism:Lawrence Lipking states 'even the [Lacanian](/wiki/Lacanian\n\"Lacanian\") subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism, for instance, has produced\nat least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel'[58] The novel today is\ngenerally considered to be a landmark work of romantic and gothic literature,\nas well as science fiction.[59]\n\nFilm director [Guillermo del Toro](/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro \"Guillermo del\nToro\") describes _Frankenstein_ as \"the quintessential teenage book\", adding\n\"You don't belong. You were brought to this world by people that don't care\nfor you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering, and tears and\nhunger. It's an amazing book written by a teenage girl. It's mind\nblowing.\"[60] Professor of philosophy [Patricia\nMacCormack](/wiki/Patricia_MacCormack \"Patricia MacCormack\") says the\ncreature, brought to life by Victor Frankenstein, addresses the most\nfundamental human questions: \"It's the idea of asking your maker what your\npurpose is. Why are we here, what can we do?\"[60]\n\n## Derivative works\n\nThere are numerous novels retelling or continuing the story of Frankenstein\nand his monster.\n\nFurther information on derivative works: [Frankenstein in popular\nculture](/wiki/Frankenstein_in_popular_culture \"Frankenstein in popular\nculture\")\n\n## Films, plays and television\n\nSee also: [List of films featuring Frankenstein's\nmonster](/wiki/List_of_films_featuring_Frankenstein%27s_monster \"List of films\nfeaturing Frankenstein's monster\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Charles_Ogle_In_Frankenstein_1910.jpg/170px-\nCharles_Ogle_In_Frankenstein_1910.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charles_Ogle_In_Frankenstein_1910.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charles_Ogle_In_Frankenstein_1910.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA photo of [Charles Ogle](/wiki/Charles_Stanton_Ogle \"Charles Stanton Ogle\")\nas the monster in _[Frankenstein](/wiki/Frankenstein_\\(1910_film\\)\n\"Frankenstein \\(1910 film\\)\")_ (1910)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Frankenstein%27s_monster_%28Boris_Karloff%29.jpg/170px-\nFrankenstein%27s_monster_%28Boris_Karloff%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Frankenstein%27s_monster_\\(Boris_Karloff\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Frankenstein%27s_monster_\\(Boris_Karloff\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA promotional photo of [Boris Karloff](/wiki/Boris_Karloff \"Boris Karloff\"),\nas Frankenstein's monster, using [Jack\nPierce's](/wiki/Jack_Pierce_\\(makeup_artist\\) \"Jack Pierce \\(makeup artist\\)\")\nmakeup design\n\n  * 1823: [Richard Brinsley Peake](/wiki/Richard_Brinsley_Peake \"Richard Brinsley Peake\")'s adaptation, _[Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein](/wiki/Presumption;_or,_the_Fate_of_Frankenstein \"Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein\")_ , was seen by [Mary Shelley](/wiki/Mary_Shelley \"Mary Shelley\") and her father [William Godwin](/wiki/William_Godwin \"William Godwin\") at the [English Opera House](/wiki/Lyceum_Theatre,_London \"Lyceum Theatre, London\").\n  * 1826: [Henry M.
