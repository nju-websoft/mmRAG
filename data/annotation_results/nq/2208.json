The company employs more than 32,400 people worldwide.\n\nFruit of the Loom also controls another long-known underwear brand,\n[B.V.D.](/wiki/B.V.D. \"B.V.D.\") (Bradley, Voorhees, and Day). Other brands\nalso manufactured and sold by the company are [Funpals](/wiki/Funpals\n\"Funpals\")/[FunGals](/wiki/FunGals \"FunGals\"), Screen Stars and\n[Underoos](/wiki/Underoos \"Underoos\"). Brands once owned or marketed by Fruit\nof the Loom include Gitano, Munsingwear, Salem Sportswear, and Pro Player,\nwhich once had the [naming rights](/wiki/Naming_rights \"Naming rights\") to\nwhat is now [Hard Rock Stadium](/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium \"Hard Rock Stadium\")\n(originally [Joe Robbie](/wiki/Joe_Robbie \"Joe Robbie\") Stadium) in [Miami\nGardens, Florida](/wiki/Miami_Gardens,_Florida \"Miami Gardens, Florida\") from\n1996 to 2005, despite bankruptcy by the parent company in 1999.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[Hanes](/wiki/Hanes \"Hanes\") and [Jockey](/wiki/Jockey_International \"Jockey\nInternational\") are the main competitors of Fruit of the Loom.\n\nThe company's familiar logo comprising a red apple, leaves, green grapes,\ncurrants, and purple grapes forms a widely recognizable trademark. The company\nis a [vertically integrated](/wiki/Vertical_integration \"Vertical\nintegration\") manufacturer. In TV commercials for the brand, actors play the\nroles of only four of the logo's parts: the apple, green grapes, purple\ngrapes, and leaves. The role of \"Apple\" is played by [Rad\nDaly](/w/index.php?title=Rad_Daly&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Rad Daly \\(page does\nnot exist\\)\"), and the \"Leaf\" was at one time played by [Academy\nAward](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\")-winning actor [F. Murray\nAbraham](/wiki/F._Murray_Abraham \"F. Murray Abraham\"), and has been played by\nGene Steichen since the Fruit Guys were re-introduced to the public in 2001.\n\"Green Grapes\" is played by [Richard Steven\nHorvitz](/wiki/Richard_Steven_Horvitz \"Richard Steven Horvitz\"). \"Purple\nGrapes\" is played by Wayne Wilderson.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Robert_Knight_Rhode_Island_textile_industrialist.jpg/187px-\nRobert_Knight_Rhode_Island_textile_industrialist.jpg)](/wiki/File:Robert_Knight_Rhode_Island_textile_industrialist.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Robert_Knight_Rhode_Island_textile_industrialist.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Robert Knight](/wiki/Robert_Knight_\\(industrialist\\) \"Robert Knight\n\\(industrialist\\)\"), founder of Fruit of the Loom\n\nFruit of the Loom acquired [Russell](/wiki/Russell_Brands \"Russell Brands\").\nBrands includes [Russell Athletic](/wiki/Russell_Athletic_\\(brand\\) \"Russell\nAthletic \\(brand\\)\"), [Brooks Running](/wiki/Brooks_Sports \"Brooks Sports\")\nand [Spalding](/wiki/Spalding_\\(sports_equipment\\) \"Spalding \\(sports\nequipment\\)\") among other names in athletic wear.\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fruit_of_the_Loom&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Fruit_of_the_Loom_Muslin_newspaper_ad.png/220px-\nFruit_of_the_Loom_Muslin_newspaper_ad.png)](/wiki/File:Fruit_of_the_Loom_Muslin_newspaper_ad.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Fruit_of_the_Loom_Muslin_newspaper_ad.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n1921 newspaper ad for Fruit of the Loom [muslin](/wiki/Muslin \"Muslin\") fabric\n\nThe Fruit of the Loom brand dates back to 1851 in [Rhode\nIsland](/wiki/Rhode_Island \"Rhode Island\")[1][2] when [Robert\nKnight](/wiki/Robert_Knight_\\(industrialist\\) \"Robert Knight\n\\(industrialist\\)\"), a textile mill owner, visited his friend, Rufus Skeel.\nSkeel owned a small shop in [Providence](/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island\n\"Providence, Rhode Island\") that sold cloth from Knight's mill. Skeel's\ndaughter painted images of apples and applied them to the bolts of cloth. The\nones with the apple emblems proved most popular. Mr. Knight thought the labels\nwould be the perfect symbol for his trade name, Fruit of the [Loom](/wiki/Loom\n\"Loom\") – an expression referring to clothes, paralleling the phrase \"[fruit\nof the womb](/w/index.php?title=Fruit_of_the_womb&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fruit\nof the womb \\(page does not exist\\)\")\" meaning \"children\", which can be traced\nback to use in the [Bible](/wiki/Bible \"Bible\") (Psalm 127:3).\n\nIn 1871, just one year after the first trademark laws were passed by Congress,\nKnight received trademark number 418 for the brand \"Fruit of the Loom\".\n\nMuch of its athletic outerwear was sold under the \"Pro Player\" label, a now\ndefunct division.\n\nThe company was part of [Northwest Industries](/wiki/Northwest_Industries\n\"Northwest Industries\"), Inc., until NWI was purchased by [William F.\nFarley](/wiki/William_F._Farley \"William F. Farley\") in 1985 and renamed\nFarley Industries, Inc.[3] Farley served as president, [chief executive\nofficer](/wiki/Chief_executive_officer \"Chief executive officer\") (CEO), and\nmajority shareholder for 15 years. Fruit of the Loom's sales revenue rose from\napproximately $500 million at the time of NWI's purchase to roughly $2.5\nbillion nearly 15 years later. Debt financing, once seen as brilliant, proved\ndifficult to manage even as sales revenue quintupled.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOn March 23, 1987, it sold its subsidiary [General\nBattery](/w/index.php?title=General_Battery&action=edit&redlink=1 \"General\nBattery \\(page does not exist\\)\") to [Exide Corporation](/wiki/Exide\n\"Exide\").[4]\n\nFruit of the Loom filed for Chapter 11 [bankruptcy](/wiki/Bankruptcy\n\"Bankruptcy\") protection in 1999 shortly after posting a net loss of $576.2\nmillion.[5] Its 66 million shares of outstanding common stock dropped in value\nfrom about $44 per share in early 1997 to just more than $1 by spring 2000.\nReasons for the bankruptcy are varied. A large debt load which was assumed in\nthe 1980s, a common practice at the time, did not help. William F. Farley, the\ncompany's former [chairman](/wiki/Chairman \"Chairman\"), CEO, and [chief\noperating officer](/wiki/Chief_operating_officer \"Chief operating officer\")\n(COO), was forced out prior to bankruptcy in late 1999, after having piloted\nthe company into massive debt and unproductive business ventures, including\nstructuring the company into an off-shore entity in the Cayman Islands to\navoid taxes.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe company was bought from bankruptcy by [Berkshire\nHathaway](/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway \"Berkshire Hathaway\") Corporation,\ncontrolled by investor [Warren Buffett](/wiki/Warren_Buffett \"Warren\nBuffett\"), who wanted the valuable brand. He agreed in January 2002 to\npurchase the company for approximately $835 million in cash. The deal was\nconcluded on April 29, 2002. A condition of the purchase required that former\nCOO and then interim CEO John Holland remain available to be the CEO for the\ncompany.[6]\n\nThe company purchased [Russell Corporation](/wiki/Russell_Corporation \"Russell\nCorporation\"), effectively taking the former competitor private, in a deal\nvalued at $598.3 million that was completed August 1, 2006.[7]\n\nThe company announced the purchase of [VF Corporation](/wiki/VF_Corporation\n\"VF Corporation\")'s intimate apparel company named Vanity Fair Intimates for\n$350 million in cash on January 23, 2007.[8]\n\nIn 2010, Rick Medlin was named president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom.\nLongtime CEO John Holland became the company's chairman.[9]\n\nIn 2014, the company closed its Jamestown (Kentucky) plant, which had once\nbeen the second manufacturing plant in the state, and laid off all 600\nemployees.[10] The company said it was moving the plant's operations to\n[Honduras](/wiki/Honduras \"Honduras\") to reduce production costs.[11]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fruit_of_the_Loom&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Fruit of the Loom\"](http://www.fotlinc.com/pages/fruit-of-the-loom-underwear-activewear-socks.html#.V1tK4TWiOYw). fotlinc.com.
