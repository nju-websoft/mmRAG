Using an example of \"75%\neffective\", the effectiveness calculation thus:\n\n> ... these numbers do not translate into a pregnancy rate of 25 percent.\n> Rather, they mean that if 1,000 women have unprotected intercourse in the\n> middle two weeks of their menstrual cycles, approximately 80 will become\n> pregnant. Use of emergency contraceptive pills would reduce this number by\n> 75 percent, to 20 women.[13]\n\nThe progestin-only regimen (using levonorgestrel) has an 89% effectiveness. As\nof\n2006[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit),\nthe labeling on the U.S. brand Plan B explained this effectiveness rate by\nstating, \"Seven out of every eight women who would have gotten pregnant will\nnot become pregnant.\"[14]\n\nIn 1999, a meta-analysis of eight studies of the combined (Yuzpe) regimen\nconcluded that the best point estimate of effectiveness was 74%.[15] A 2003\nanalysis of two of the largest combined (Yuzpe) regimen studies, using a\ndifferent calculation method, found effectiveness estimates of 47% and\n53%.[16]\n\nFor both the progestin-only and Yuzpe regimens, the effectiveness of emergency\ncontraception is highest when taken within 12 hours of intercourse and\ndeclines over time.[17][18][19] The [World Health\nOrganization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization \"World Health Organization\")\n(WHO) suggested that reasonable effectiveness may continue for up to 120 hours\n(5 days) after intercourse.[20]\n\nFor 10 mg of mifepristone taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse,\nthe combined estimate from three trials was an effectiveness of 83%.[21] A\nreview found that a moderate dose of mifepristone is better than LNG or\nYuzpe.[22]\n\nHRA Pharma changed its packaging information for Norlevo (which has dosage and\nchemical makeup identical to many other EHCs) in November 2013 warning that\nthe drug loses effectiveness in women who weigh more than 165 pounds and is\ncompletely ineffective for women who weigh over 176 pounds.[23][24]\n\n###\nSafety[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Safety\")]\n\nThe most common side effect reported by users of emergency contraceptive pills\nwas [nausea](/wiki/Nausea \"Nausea\") (50.5% of 979 Yuzpe regimen users and\n23.1% of 977 levonorgestrel-only users in the 1998 WHO trial; 14.3% of 2,720\nlevonorgestrel-only users in the 2002 WHO trial); [vomiting](/wiki/Vomiting\n\"Vomiting\") is much less common and unusual with levonorgestrel-only ECPs\n(18.8% of 979 Yuzpe regimen users and 5.6% of levonorgestrel-only users in the\n1998 WHO trial; 1.4% of 2,720 levonorgestrel-only users in the 2002 WHO\ntrial).[17][20][25] [Anti-emetics](/wiki/Antiemetic \"Antiemetic\") are not\nroutinely recommended with levonorgestrel-only ECPs.[25][26] If a woman vomits\nwithin 2 hours of taking a levonorgestrel-only ECP, she should take a further\ndose as soon as possible.[25][27]\n\nOther common side effects (each reported by less than 20% of levonorgestrel-\nonly users in both the 1998 and 2002 WHO trials) were [abdominal\npain](/wiki/Abdominal_pain \"Abdominal pain\"),\n[fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_\\(physical\\) \"Fatigue \\(physical\\)\"),\n[headache](/wiki/Headache \"Headache\"), [dizziness](/wiki/Dizziness\n\"Dizziness\"), and [breast tenderness](/wiki/Mastalgia\n\"Mastalgia\").[17][20][25] Side effects usually do not occur for more than a\nfew days after treatment, and they generally resolve within 24 hours.[6]\n\nTemporary disruption of the menstrual cycle is also commonly experienced. If\ntaken before ovulation, the high doses of progestogen in levonorgestrel\ntreatments may induce [progestogen withdrawal\nbleeding](/wiki/Progestogen#Progestogen_withdrawal_bleeding \"Progestogen\") a\nfew days after the pills are taken. One study found that about half of women\nwho used levonorgestrel ECPs experienced bleeding within 7 days of taking the\npills.[28] If levonorgestrel is taken after ovulation, it may increase the\nlength of the [luteal phase](/wiki/Luteal_phase \"Luteal phase\"), thus delaying\nmenstruation by a few days.[29] Mifepristone, if taken before ovulation, may\ndelay ovulation by 3–4 days[30] (delayed ovulation may result in a delayed\nmenstruation). These disruptions only occur in the cycle in which ECPs were\ntaken; subsequent cycle length is not significantly affected.[28] If a woman's\nmenstrual period is delayed by two weeks or more, it is advised that she take\na [pregnancy test](/wiki/Pregnancy_test \"Pregnancy test\").[31] (Earlier\ntesting may not give accurate results.)\n\nExisting pregnancy is not a [contraindication](/wiki/Contraindication\n\"Contraindication\") in terms of safety, as there is no known harm to the\nwoman, the course of her pregnancy, or the fetus if progestin-only or combined\nemergency contraception pills are accidentally used, but EC is not\n[indicated](/wiki/Indication_\\(medicine\\) \"Indication \\(medicine\\)\") for a\nwoman with a known or suspected pregnancy because it is not effective in women\nwho are already pregnant.[6][32][33][31][34][35][36][37][38]\n\nThe [World Health Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization \"World Health\nOrganization\") (WHO) lists no medical condition for which the risks of\nemergency contraceptive pills outweigh the benefits.[35] The [American Academy\nof Pediatrics](/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics \"American Academy of\nPediatrics\") (AAP) and experts on emergency contraception have concluded that\nprogestin-only ECPs may be preferable to combined ECPs containing estrogen in\nwomen with a history of blood clots, stroke, or migraine.[6][32][33]\n\nThere are no medical conditions in which progestin-only ECPs are\ncontraindicated.[6][32][33][31][34][35][36] Current [venous\nthromboembolism](/wiki/Venous_thrombosis \"Venous thrombosis\"), current or past\nhistory of [breast cancer](/wiki/Breast_cancer \"Breast cancer\"), [inflammatory\nbowel disease](/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease \"Inflammatory bowel disease\"),\nand [acute intermittent porphyria](/wiki/Acute_intermittent_porphyria \"Acute\nintermittent porphyria\") are conditions where the advantages of using\nemergency contraceptive pills generally outweigh the theoretical or proven\nrisks.[36]\n\nECPs, like all other contraceptives, reduce the absolute risk of [ectopic\npregnancy](/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy \"Ectopic pregnancy\") by preventing\npregnancies and there is no increase in the relative risk of ectopic pregnancy\nin women who become pregnant after using progestin-only ECPs.[6][39][40]\n\n####\nInteractions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Interactions\")]\n\nThe herbal preparation of [St John's wort](/wiki/Hypericum_perforatum\n\"Hypericum perforatum\") and some [enzyme-inducing](/wiki/Enzyme_induction\n\"Enzyme induction\") drugs (e.g. [anticonvulsants](/wiki/Anticonvulsant\n\"Anticonvulsant\") or [rifampicin](/wiki/Rifampicin \"Rifampicin\")) may reduce\nthe effectiveness of ECP, and a larger dose may be required.[25][41]\n\n## Intrauterine\ndevice[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Intrauterine device\")]\n\nAn alternative to emergency contraceptive pills is the copper-T [intrauterine\ndevice](/wiki/Intrauterine_device \"Intrauterine device\") (IUD) which can be\nused up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse to prevent pregnancy.\nInsertion of an IUD is more effective than use of Emergency Contraceptive\nPills - pregnancy rates when used as emergency contraception are the same as\nwith normal IUD use. IUDs may be left in place following the subsequent\nmenstruation to provide ongoing contraception (3–10 years depending upon\ntype).[42]\n\n## As regular\ncontraception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: As regular contraception\")]\n\nOne brand of [levonorgestrel](/wiki/Levonorgestrel \"Levonorgestrel\") pills was\nmarketed as an ongoing method of postcoital contraception.[43] However, there\nare serious drawbacks to such use of postcoital high-dose progestin-only oral\ncontraceptive pills, especially if they are not used according to their\npackage directions, but are instead used according to the package directions\nof emergency contraceptive pills:\n\n  * Due to the increasing severity of side effects with frequent use, Postinor is only recommended for women who have intercourse four or fewer times per month.[43][44]\n  * If not used according to their package directions, but instead used according to the directions of levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills (up to 72 hours after intercourse), they would be estimated to have a \"perfect-use\" (when not used according to their package directions but used as directed on the package directions for levonorgestrel emergency contraception pills) pregnancy rate of 20% per year when used as the sole means of contraception (as compared to a 40% annual pregnancy rate for the Yuzpe regimen).[45] These failure rates would be higher than those of almost all other birth control methods, including the [rhythm method](/wiki/Calendar-based_methods \"Calendar-based methods\") and [withdrawal](/wiki/Coitus_interruptus \"Coitus interruptus\").[46]\n  * Like all hormonal methods, postcoital high-dose progestin-only oral contraceptive pills do not protect against [sexually transmitted infections](/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection \"Sexually transmitted infection\").[47]\n\nECPs are generally recommended for backup or \"emergency\" use, rather than as\nthe primary means of contraception. They are intended for use when other means\nof contraception have failed—for example, if a woman has forgotten to take a\nbirth control pill or when a [condom](/wiki/Condom \"Condom\") is torn during\nsex.[45]\n\n## Relationship to high risk sex and\nabortion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Relationship to high risk sex and abortion\")]\n\nThe current (December 2012) [American Academy of\nPediatrics](/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics \"American Academy of\nPediatrics\") (AAP) Policy Statement on Emergency Contraception says: \"Despite\nmultiple studies showing no increased risk behavior and evidence that hormonal\nemergency contraception will not disrupt an established pregnancy, public and\nmedical discourse reflects that personal values of physicians and pharmacists\ncontinue to affect emergency-contraception access, particularly for\nadolescents.\"[48]\n\nThe latest (December 2013) review by emergency contraception experts Trussell\nand Raymond says: \"Published evidence would seem to demonstrate convincingly\nthat making ECPs more widely available does not increase risk-taking or\nadversely affect regular contraceptive use\". . . .\"However, reanalysis of one\nof the randomized trials suggests that easier access to ECPs may have\nincreased the frequency of coital acts with the potential to lead to\npregnancy.\"[6] and notes that four [randomized controlled\ntrials](/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial \"Randomized controlled trial\") have\nfound that advanced provision of emergency contraceptive pills did not\nincrease rates of sexually transmitted infections or sexual risk\ntaking.[49][50][51][52] Trussell and Raymond noted that after one of the four\nstudies had been reanalysed later, the data did show higher sexual risk-\ntaking,[6] specifically substituting in some cases emergency contraceptives\nfor contraceptives such as condoms that are more effective.\n\nIn France, Sweden, and Britain—where Yuzpe-regimen EC had been available by\nprescription for more than a decade and progestin-only EC has been available\nwithout a prescription for 8, 6, and 2 years respectively—the abortion rate\nwas stable or higher during that time period.[53] Another study concluded that\ndistribution of free, advance supplies of EC to large numbers of women in\nScotland did not reduce abortion rates.[54] A [randomized controlled\ntrial](/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial \"Randomized controlled trial\") of\n2000 women in China compared women with advance access to EC to women without\naccess, and noted that the pregnancy rate was the same between the two groups.\nThe study observed that \"...providing EC in advance increases use, but there\nis no direct evidence that it reduces unintended pregnancy\" and concluded that\nEC may not lower abortion rates.[55]\n\nIn September 2006, emergency contraception expert [Anna\nGlasier](/wiki/Anna_Glasier \"Anna Glasier\") wrote a\n_[BMJ](/wiki/British_Medical_Journal \"British Medical Journal\")_ editorial\nentitled \"Emergency Contraception. Is it worth all the fuss?\" that said in\nclosing: \"So is emergency contraception worth the fuss? If you are a woman who\nhas had unprotected sex then of course it is, because emergency contraception\nwill prevent pregnancy in some women some of the time—and if you don’t want to\nget pregnant anything is better than nothing. If you are the\n_[CMAJ](/wiki/Canadian_Medical_Association_Journal \"Canadian Medical\nAssociation Journal\")’_s editor or FDA commissioner then yes, because\nscientific freedom is worth the fight. If you are looking for an intervention\nthat will reduce abortion rates, emergency contraception may not be the\nsolution, and perhaps you should concentrate most on encouraging people to use\ncontraception before or during sex, not after it.\"[56]\n\n## EC and sexual\nassault[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: EC and sexual assault\")]\n\nBefore EC was used in the general population or defined as \"emergency\ncontraception,\" it was used, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, specifically for\nwomen who had been sexually assaulted.[57][58] Pregnancy rates among rape\nvictims of child-bearing age are around 5%; in the U.S., about half of rape\nvictims who become pregnant have abortions.[59] Although EC is commonly used\nas an option for victims of sexual assault, some researchers believe such use\nis a public health measure that is not sufficiently widespread.[60]\n\n## Mechanism of\naction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Mechanism of action\")]\n\nThe primary mechanism of action of progestogen-only emergency contraceptive\npills is to prevent fertilization by inhibition of\novulation.[3][25][39][61][62][63] The best available evidence is that they do\nnot have any post-fertilization effects such as the prevention of\n[implantation](/wiki/Implantation_\\(human_embryo\\) \"Implantation \\(human\nembryo\\)\").[3][25][39][61][62][63] The U.S.\n[FDA](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration \"Food and Drug\nAdministration\")-approved labels and European\n[EMA](/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency \"European Medicines Agency\")-approved\nlabels (except for HRA Pharma's _NorLevo_) levonorgestrel emergency\ncontraceptive pills (based on labels for regular [oral contraceptive\npills](/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill \"Combined oral contraceptive\npill\")) say they may cause [endometrial](/wiki/Endometrium \"Endometrium\")\nchanges that discourage implantation.[64][65][66] Daily use of regular oral\ncontraceptive pills can alter the endometrium (although this has not been\nproven to interfere with implantation), but the isolated use of a\nlevonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pill does not have time to alter the\nendometrium.[64] In March 2011, the [International Federation of Gynecology\nand Obstetrics](/wiki/International_Federation_of_Gynecology_and_Obstetrics\n\"International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics\") (FIGO) issued a\nstatement that: \"review of the evidence suggests that LNG [levonorgestreol]\nECPs cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Language on implantation\nshould not be included in LNG ECP product labeling.\"[64][67] In June 2012, a\n_[New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ editorial\ncalled on the FDA to remove from the label the unsupported suggestion that\nlevonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills inhibit implantation.[68] In\nNovember 2013, the [European Medicines Agency](/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency\n\"European Medicines Agency\") (EMA) approved a change to the label for HRA\nPharma's _NorLevo_ saying it cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized\negg.[69]\n\nProgestogen-only emergency contraceptive does not appear to affect the\nfunction of the Fallopian tubes or increase the rate of ectopic\npregnancies.[70]\n\nThe primary mechanism of action of [progesterone receptor\nmodulator](/wiki/Selective_progesterone_receptor_modulator \"Selective\nprogesterone receptor modulator\") emergency contraceptive pills like low-dose\nand mid-dose [mifepristone](/wiki/Mifepristone \"Mifepristone\") and [ulipristal\nacetate](/wiki/Ulipristal_acetate \"Ulipristal acetate\") is to prevent\nfertilization by inhibition or delay of ovulation.[3][25][61][62][63][71] One\nclinical study found that post-ovulatory administration of ulipristal acetate\naltered the endometrium, but whether the changes would inhibit implantation is\nunknown.[3][72] The European EMA-approved labels for ulipristal acetate\nemergency contraceptive pills do not mention an effect on implantation, but\nthe U.S. FDA-approved label says: \"alterations to the endometrium that may\naffect implantation may also contribute to efficacy.\"[64][73][74]\n\nThe primary mechanism of action of [copper-releasing intrauterine\ndevices](/wiki/IUD_with_copper \"IUD with copper\") (IUDs) as emergency\ncontraceptives is to prevent fertilization because of copper toxicity to\n[sperm](/wiki/Spermatozoon \"Spermatozoon\") and [ova](/wiki/Ovum\n\"Ovum\").[3][25] The very high effectiveness of copper-releasing IUDs as\nemergency contraceptives implies that they must also prevent some pregnancies\nby post-fertilization effects such as prevention of implantation.[3][25][61]\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nIn 1966, gynecologist [John McLean Morris](/wiki/John_McLean_Morris \"John\nMcLean Morris\") and biologist [Gertrude Van\nWagenen](/wiki/Gertrude_Van_Wagenen \"Gertrude Van Wagenen\") at the [Yale\nSchool of Medicine](/wiki/Yale_School_of_Medicine \"Yale School of Medicine\")\nreported the successful use of oral high-dose estrogen pills as post-coital\ncontraceptives in women and [rhesus macaque](/wiki/Rhesus_macaque \"Rhesus\nmacaque\") monkeys, respectively.[75][76] A few different drugs were studied,\nwith a focus on high-dose estrogens, and it was originally hoped that\npostcoital contraception would prove viable as an ongoing contraceptive\nmethod.[77]\n\nThe first widely used methods were five-day treatments with high-dose\nestrogens, using [diethylstilbestrol](/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol\n\"Diethylstilbestrol\") (DES) in the US and ethinylestradiol in the Netherlands\nby Dr. Haspels.[78][79]\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Yuzpe regimen was developed by [A. Albert\nYuzpe](/wiki/A._Albert_Yuzpe \"A. Albert Yuzpe\") in 1974;[80] progestin-only\npostcoital contraception was investigated (1975);[81] and the copper IUD was\nfirst studied for use as emergency contraception (1975).[82]\n[Danazol](/wiki/Danazol \"Danazol\") was tested in the early 1980s in the hopes\nthat it would have fewer side effects than Yuzpe, but was found to be\nineffective.[83]\n\nThe Yuzpe regimen became the standard course of treatment for postcoital\ncontraception in many countries in the 1980s. The first prescription-only\ncombined estrogen-progestin dedicated product, Schering PC4 (ethinylestradiol\nand norgestrel), was approved in the UK in January 1984 and first marketed in\nOctober 1984.[84] Schering introduced a second prescription-only combined\nproduct, Tetragynon (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) in Germany in\n1985.[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=3774816)\nBy 1997, [Schering AG](/wiki/Schering_AG \"Schering AG\") dedicated\nprescription-only combined products had been approved in only 9 countries: the\nUK (Schering PC4), New Zealand (Schering PC4), South Africa (E-Gen-C), Germany\n(Tetragynon), Switzerland (Tetragynon), Denmark (Tetragynon), Norway\n(Tetragynon), Sweden (Tetragynon) and Finland (Neoprimavlar); and had been\nwithdrawn from marketing in New Zealand in 1997 to prevent it being sold over-\nthe-counter.[[2]](http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/nda/99/21-045_Plan%20B_medr.pdf)\n[[3]](http://www.amwa-\ndoc.org/index.cfm?objectid=1413E9D2-D567-0B25-593F3D9007E7AA63)[_[permanent\ndead link](/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot \"Wikipedia:Link rot\")_]\n[[4]](http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/dedicated.html) Regular combined oral\ncontraceptive pills (which were less expensive and more widely available) were\nmore commonly used for the Yuzpe regimen even in countries where dedicated\nproducts were available.[85]\n\nOver time, interest in progestin-only treatments increased. The Special\nProgram on Human Reproduction (HRP), an international organization whose\nmembers include the [World Bank](/wiki/World_Bank \"World Bank\") and [World\nHealth Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization \"World Health\nOrganization\"), \"played a pioneering role in emergency contraception\" by\n\"confirming the effectiveness of levonorgestrel.\"[86] After the WHO conducted\na large trial comparing Yuzpe and levonorgestrel in 1998,[87][88] combined\nestrogen-progestin products were gradually withdrawn from some markets\n(_Preven_ in the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\")\ndiscontinued May 2004, _Schering PC4_ in the UK discontinued October 2001, and\n_Tetragynon_ in France) in favor of progestin-only EC, although prescription-\nonly dedicated Yuzpe regimen products are still available in some countries.\n\nIn 2002, China became the first country in which mifepristone was registered\nfor use as EC.\n\n### Calculating\neffectiveness[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Calculating effectiveness\")]\n\nEarly studies of emergency contraceptives did not attempt to calculate a\nfailure rate; they simply reported the number of women who became pregnant\nafter using an emergency contraceptive. Since 1980, clinical trials of\nemergency contraception have first calculated probable pregnancies in the\nstudy group if no treatment were given. The effectiveness is calculated by\ndividing observed pregnancies by the estimated number of pregnancies without\ntreatment.[89]\n\nPlacebo-controlled trials that could give a precise measure of the pregnancy\nrate without treatment would be unethical, so the effectiveness percentage is\nbased on estimated pregnancy rates. These are currently estimated using\nvariants of the [calendar method](/wiki/Calendar_method \"Calendar\nmethod\").[90] Women with irregular cycles for any reason (including recent\nhormone use such as oral contraceptives and\n[breastfeeding](/wiki/Breastfeeding \"Breastfeeding\")) must be excluded from\nsuch calculations. Even for women included in the calculation, the limitations\nof calendar methods of fertility determination have [long been\nrecognized](/wiki/Calendar-based_methods#Failure_rate \"Calendar-based\nmethods\"). In their February 2014 emergency review article, Trussell and\nRaymond note:\n\n> Calculation of effectiveness, and particularly the denominator of the\n> fraction, involves many assumptions that are difficult to validate...The\n> risk of pregnancy for women requesting ECPs appears to be lower than assumed\n> in the estimates of ECP efficacy, which are consequently likely to be\n> overestimates. Yet, precise estimates of efficacy may not be highly relevant\n> to many women who have had unprotected intercourse, since ECPs are often the\n> only available treatment.[6]\n\nIn 1999, hormonal assay was suggested as a more accurate method of estimating\nfertility for EC studies.[91]\n\n### United\nStates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: United States\")]\n\n####\nDES[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: DES\")]\n\n  * In 1971, a _[New England Journal of Medicine](/wiki/New_England_Journal_of_Medicine \"New England Journal of Medicine\")_ editorial calling attention to previously published studies on the use of [DES](/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol \"Diethylstilbestrol\") as a postcoital contraceptive at [Yale University](/wiki/Yale_University \"Yale University\"), and a large study published in _[JAMA](/wiki/Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Association \"Journal of the American Medical Association\")_ on the use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive at the [University of Michigan](/wiki/University_of_Michigan \"University of Michigan\"), led to off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive becoming prevalent at many university health services.[92][93]\n  * In May 1973, in an attempt to restrict off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive to emergency situations such as [rape](/wiki/Rape \"Rape\"), a _FDA Drug Bulletin_ was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES.[94] (In February 1975, the FDA Commissioner testified that the only error in the May 1973 _FDA Drug Bulletin_ was that the FDA had **not** approved postcoital contraceptive use of DES.)[95]\n  * In September 1973, the FDA published a proposed rule specifying patient labeling and special packaging requirements for any manufacturer seeking FDA approval to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, inviting manufacturers to submit abbreviated [new drug applications](/wiki/New_drug_application \"New drug application\") (ANDAs) for that indication, and notifying manufacturers that the FDA intended to order the withdrawal of DES 25 mg tablets (which were being used off-label as postcoital contraceptives).[96][97][97][98]\n  * In late 1973, [Eli Lilly](/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company \"Eli Lilly and Company\"), the largest U.S. manufacturer of DES, discontinued its DES 25 mg tablets and in March 1974 sent a letter to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists telling them it did not recommend use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive.[95]\n  * Only one pharmaceutical company, Tablicaps, Inc., a small manufacturer of [generic drugs](/wiki/Generic_drug \"Generic drug\"), ever submitted (in January 1974) an ANDA for use of DES as an emergency postcoital contraceptive, and the FDA never approved it.[95][99]\n  * In February 1975, the FDA said it had not yet approved DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would after March 8, 1975 permit marketing of DES for that indication in emergency situations such as rape or incest _if_ a manufacturer obtained an approved ANDA that provided patient labeling and special packaging as set out in a FDA final rule published in February 1975.[100] To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, in February 1975 the FDA ordered DES 25 mg (and higher) tablets removed from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5 mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications be changed to state: \"THIS DRUG PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A POSTCOITAL CONTRACEPTIVE\" in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label.[97][101]\n  * In March 1978, a _FDA Drug Bulletin_ was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists which said: \"FDA has not yet given approval for any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive. The Agency, however, will approve this indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provides patient labeling and special packaging. To discourage 'morning after' use of DES without patient labeling, FDA has removed from the market the 25 mg tablets of DES, formerly used for this purpose.\"[102]\n  * In the 1980s, off-label use of the Yuzpe regimen superseded off-label use of DES for postcoital contraception.[99][103][104]\n    * DES is no longer commercially available in the U.S.; Eli Lilly, the last U.S. manufacturer, ceased production in spring 1997.[105]\n\n####\nPreven[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Preven\")]\n\n  * On February 25, 1997, the FDA posted a notice in the _[Federal Register](/wiki/Federal_Register \"Federal Register\")_ saying it had concluded that the Yuzpe regimen was safe and effective for off-label use as postcoital EC, was prepared to accept NDAs for COCPs labeled as ECPs, and listed 6 then available COCPs (there are now 22) that could be used as ECPs.[5]\n  * On September 1, 1998, the FDA approved the prescription Yuzpe regimen Preven Emergency Contraception Kit (which contained a urine pregnancy test and 4 COCPs).[106] Preven was discontinued in May 2004.[107]\n\n#### Plan\nB[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Emergency_contraception&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Plan B\")]\n\n  * On July 28, 1999, the FDA approved the prescription progestin-only Plan B (two 750 µg [levonorgestrel](/wiki/Levonorgestrel \"Levonorgestrel\") pills) emergency contraceptive.[108]\n  * On August 24, 2006, the FDA approved nonprescription behind-the-counter access to Plan B from pharmacies staffed by a licensed pharmacist for women 18 or older; a prescription-only form of Plan B was made available for younger females aged 17 and younger.[109]\n  * On November 6, 2006, [Barr Pharmaceuticals](/wiki/Barr_Pharmaceuticals \"Barr Pharmaceuticals\") announced that its subsidiary, Duramed Pharmaceuticals, had initiated shipment of dual-label Plan B OTC/Rx and it would be available in pharmacies across the U.S. by mid-November 2006.[110]\n  * On March 23, 2009, a US judge ordered the FDA to allow 17-year-olds to acquire Plan B without a prescription.[111] This now changes the August 24, 2006 ruling and Plan B is now available \"behind the counter\" for men and women. There is a prescription method available for girls under 17.\n  * On April 30, 2013, the FDA approved (with three-year marketing exclusivity) [Teva Pharmaceutical Industries](/wiki/Teva_Pharmaceutical_Industries \"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries\") Plan B One-Step for sale without a prescription to anyone age 15 or over who can show proof of age such as a [driver's license](/wiki/Driver%27s_license \"Driver's license\"), [birth certificate](/wiki/Birth_certificate \"Birth certificate\"), or [passport](/wiki/Passport \"Passport\") to a drug store [retail clerk](/wiki/Retail_clerk \"Retail clerk\").[112] [Generic](/wiki/Generic_drug \"Generic drug\") one-pill levonorgestrel emergency contraceptives and all two-pill levonorgestrel emergency contraceptives will remain restricted to sale from a [pharmacist](/wiki/Pharmacist \"Pharmacist\")—without a prescription to anyone age 17 or over who can show proof of age.[112]\n  * On June 10, 2013, the Obama administration ceased trying to block the over-the-counter availability the pill for all women and girls.

Ulipristal acetate (ellaOne) has similar biologic\n> effects as mifepristone and is approved for emergency contraception in\n> Europe and is expected to become available in the U.S.in a single oral dose\n> of 30 mg.
