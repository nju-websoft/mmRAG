I'll do practically anything. I'm the biggest whore on the block. I live in a little town in Montana, and you have to drag me out of here to get to L.A., so I'm not readily available. But unless it's something sexist or cruel, I just love to work. I've done all sorts of things, but you just haven't seen them because they're often very bad and shown at 4 in the morning.[29] | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Margot_Kidder_in_June_2013.jpg/170px-\nMargot_Kidder_in_June_2013.jpg)](/wiki/File:Margot_Kidder_in_June_2013.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Margot_Kidder_in_June_2013.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nKidder in June 2013\n\nIn 2015 Kidder won an [Emmy](/wiki/Emmy \"Emmy\") award for [Outstanding\nPerformer in Children's\nProgramming](/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Performer_in_Children%27s_Programming\n\"Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in Children's Programming\") for\nher performance in _[R.L.

She was unable to work\nfor two years, causing her financial difficulties. She was diagnosed with\n[bipolar disorder](/wiki/Bipolar_disorder \"Bipolar disorder\"), which was the\ncause of a widely publicized [manic episode](/wiki/Mania \"Mania\") that she\nexperienced in April 1996. At the time, Kidder had been working on an\n[autobiography](/wiki/Autobiography \"Autobiography\") when her laptop computer\nbecame infected with a [virus](/wiki/Computer_virus \"Computer virus\"), which\ncaused it to crash and her to lose three years' worth of drafts.[26] Kidder\nflew to [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\") to have the computer\nexamined by a data retrieval company, who ultimately were unable to retrieve\nthe files.[26] She entered a manic state and disappeared for four days.

In the early 1990s, during the first [Gulf War](/wiki/Gulf_War \"Gulf\nWar\"), Kidder was branded a \"Baghdad Betty\" and subjected to abuse for her\nremarks questioning the war.[39] In a piece called \"Confessions of 'Baghdad\nBetty'\", styled as a letter to her mother and printed in _[The\nNation](/wiki/The_Nation \"The Nation\")_ , Kidder responded by explaining and\ndefending her statements.[40]\n\nAs of November 2009, Kidder was the [Montana](/wiki/Montana \"Montana\") State\nCoordinator for [Progressive Democrats of\nAmerica](/wiki/Progressive_Democrats_of_America \"Progressive Democrats of\nAmerica\").

I reject\nthe words I voiced at my citizenship ceremony.\"[47]\n\nIn addition to her campaigning in the United States, Kidder expressed support\nfor liberal causes in Canada. In 2011, she supported her brother, John Kidder,\nin British Columbia, who was running to be a member of Canada's Parliament for\nthe [Liberal Party](/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada \"Liberal Party of Canada\"):\n\n“ | I'm here not only because John is a dream candidate but because I'm living in the end game in the United States and it's not funny.
