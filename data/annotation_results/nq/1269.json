(However, in the Talmud and other sources of Jewish law\nthere is also a process, called _[kiddushin](/wiki/Kiddush \"Kiddush\")_ ,\ncorresponding to what today is called engagement. Marrying without such an\nagreement is considered immoral.[1] To complicate matters, _erusin_ in modern\nHebrew means engagement, not betrothal.)\n\nThis was later adopted in Ancient Greece as the _gamos_ and _engeysis_\nrituals, although unlike in Judaism the contract made in front of witness was\nonly verbal.[2] The giving of a ring was eventually borrowed from Judaism by\nRoman marriage law, with the fiancé presenting it after swearing the oath of\nmarriage intent, and presenting of the gifts at the engagement party.[3]\n\n## Betrothal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Engagement&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Betrothal\")]\n\n\"Betrothed\" redirects here.

Since the Middle Ages the two ceremonies have taken place as a\ncombined ceremony performed in public. The _betrothal_ is now generally part\nof the [Jewish wedding](/wiki/Jewish_wedding \"Jewish wedding\") ceremony,\naccomplished when the groom gives the bride the ring or another object of at\nleast nominal value.[4] As mentioned above, betrothal in Judaism is separate\nfrom engagement; breaking a betrothal requires a formal\n[divorce](/wiki/Get_\\(divorce_document\\) \"Get \\(divorce document\\)\"), and\nviolation of betrothal is considered [adultery](/wiki/Adultery \"Adultery\").\n\nTypical steps of a match were the following:\n\n  * Negotiation of a match, usually done by the couple's families with bride and groom having varying levels of input, from no input, to veto power, to a fuller voice in the selection of marriage partner. \n    * This is not as widely practiced as it was historically, although it is still common in culturally conservative communities in [Israel](/wiki/Israel \"Israel\"), [India](/wiki/India \"India\"), Africa, and Persian Gulf countries, although most of these have a requirement that the bride be at least allowed veto power.\n  * Negotiation of [bride price](/wiki/Bride_price \"Bride price\") or [dowry](/wiki/Dowry \"Dowry\")\n    * In most cultures evolved from Europe, bride prices or dowries have been reduced to the [engagement ring](/wiki/Engagement_ring \"Engagement ring\") accompanying the marriage contract, while in other cultures, such as those on the Arabian Peninsula, they are still part of negotiating a marriage contract.\n  * Blessing by the parents and [clergy](/wiki/Clergy \"Clergy\")\n  * Exchange of Vows and Signing of Contracts \n    * Often one of these is omitted\n  * Celebration\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Lionel_Logue_1906.jpg/220px-\nLionel_Logue_1906.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lionel_Logue_1906.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Lionel_Logue_1906.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nEngagement photograph of [Lionel Logue](/wiki/Lionel_Logue \"Lionel Logue\") and\nMyrtle Gruenert, 1906.\n\nThe exact duration of a betrothal varies according to culture and the\nparticipants’ needs and wishes. For adults, it may be anywhere from several\nhours (when the betrothal is incorporated into the wedding day itself) to a\nperiod of several years. A year and a day are common in [neo-pagan](/wiki/Neo-\npagan \"Neo-pagan\") groups today. In the case of [child\nmarriage](/wiki/Child_marriage \"Child marriage\"), betrothal might last from\ninfancy until the age of marriage.\n\nThe responsibilities and privileges of betrothal vary. In most cultures, the\nbetrothed couple is expected to spend much time together, learning about each\nother. In some historical cultures (including [colonial North\nAmerica](/wiki/Colonial_North_America \"Colonial North America\")), the\nbetrothal was essentially a trial marriage, with marriage only being required\nin cases of conception of a child. Almost all cultures are loosening\nrestrictions against physical contact between partners, even in cultures that\nnormally had strong prohibitions against it. The betrothal period was also\nconsidered to be a preparatory time, in which the groom built a house, started\na business or otherwise proved his readiness to enter adult society.\n\nIn [medieval Europe](/wiki/Medieval_Europe \"Medieval Europe\"), in [canon\nlaw](/wiki/Canon_law \"Canon law\"), a betrothal could be formed by the exchange\nof [vows](/wiki/Vow \"Vow\") in the future tense (\"I _will_ take you as my\nwife/husband,\" instead of \"I take you as my wife/husband\"), but sexual\nintercourse consummated the vows, making a binding marriage rather than a\nbetrothal. Although these betrothals could be concluded with only the vows\nspoken by the couple, they had legal implications: [Richard III of\nEngland](/wiki/Richard_III_of_England \"Richard III of England\") had his [older\nbrother's children](/wiki/Princes_in_the_Tower \"Princes in the Tower\")\ndeclared illegitimate on the grounds their father had been betrothed to\nanother woman when he married their mother.\n\nA betrothal is considered to be a 'semi-binding' contract. Normal reasons for\ninvalidation of a betrothal include:\n\n  * Revelation of a prior commitment or marriage\n  * Evidence of [infidelity](/wiki/Infidelity \"Infidelity\")\n  * Failure to conceive (in 'trial marriage' cultures)\n  * Failure of either party to meet the financial and property stipulations of the betrothal contract\n\nNormally, either party can break a betrothal, though some financial penalty\n(such as forfeit of the bride price) usually applies. In some [common\nlaw](/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") countries, including England and Wales and\nmany US states, it was once possible for the spurned partner (often only the\nwoman) to sue the other for [breach of promise](/wiki/Breach_of_promise\n\"Breach of promise\") or \"heart-balm\". This provided some protection in an age\nwhere virginity at marriage was considered important and having a failed\nengagement could damage one's reputation, but this [tort](/wiki/Tort \"Tort\")\nhas become obsolete in most jurisdictions as attitudes to premarital sex have\nsoftened and emphasis shifted to allowing people to leave loveless\nrelationships.[5]\n\n### Protestant\nChurches[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Engagement&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Protestant Churches\")]\n\nThe Rite of Betrothal in the [Anglican Communion](/wiki/Anglican_Communion\n\"Anglican Communion\") is found within [The Book of Common\nPrayer](/wiki/The_Book_of_Common_Prayer \"The Book of Common Prayer\"), first\npublished in 1549.[6] The Anglican Communion, as well as the Methodist Church\nand Presbyterian Church, has questions & responses for family members in its\nRite of Betrothal.[7]\n\n### Orthodox\nChurches[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Engagement&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Orthodox Churches\")]\n\nIn the [Eastern Orthodox](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox \"Eastern Orthodox\") and\n[Oriental Orthodox](/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox \"Oriental Orthodox\") Churches, the\nRite of Betrothal is traditionally performed in the [narthex](/wiki/Narthex\n\"Narthex\") (entranceway) of the church, to indicate the couple's first\nentrance into the married estate. The priest blesses the couple and gives them\nlit candles to hold. Then, after a [litany](/wiki/Ektenia \"Ektenia\"), and a\nprayer at which everyone bows, he places the bride's ring on the ring finger\nof the groom's right hand, and the groom's ring on the bride's finger. The\nrings are subsequently exchanged three times, either by the priest or by the\nbest man, after which the priest says a final prayer. Originally, the\nbetrothal service would take place at the time the engagement was announced.\nIn recent times, however, it tends to be performed immediately before the\nwedding ceremony itself. The exchange of rings is not a part of the wedding\nservice in the Eastern Churches, but only occurs at the betrothal.\nTraditionally, the groom's ring is gold and the bride's ring is silver.[8]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_avril.jpg/170px-\nLes_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_avril.jpg)](/wiki/File:Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_avril.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Les_Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_avril.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Très Riches Heures du Duc de\nBerry](/wiki/Tr%C3%A8s_Riches_Heures_du_Duc_de_Berry \"Très Riches Heures du\nDuc de Berry\") depicting a betrothal.

The concept of an official engagement period in [Western\nEuropean](/wiki/Western_European \"Western European\") culture may have begun in\n1215 at the [Fourth Lateran Council](/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council \"Fourth\nLateran Council\"), headed by [Pope Innocent III](/wiki/Pope_Innocent_III \"Pope\nInnocent III\"), which decreed that \"marriages are to be ... announced publicly\nin the churches by the priests during a suitable and fixed time so that, if\nlegitimate [impediments](/wiki/Canonical_impediment \"Canonical impediment\")\nexist, they may be made known.\"[10][11] Such a formal church announcement of\nthe intent to marry is known as [banns](/wiki/Banns \"Banns\"). In some\njurisdictions, reading the banns may be part of one type of legal marriage.\n\n## Engagement rings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Engagement&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Engagement rings\")]\n\nMain article: [Engagement ring](/wiki/Engagement_ring \"Engagement ring\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Wedding_and_Engagement_Rings_2151px.jpg/220px-\nWedding_and_Engagement_Rings_2151px.jpg)](/wiki/File:Wedding_and_Engagement_Rings_2151px.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Wedding_and_Engagement_Rings_2151px.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [white gold](/wiki/White_gold \"White gold\") [wedding\nring](/wiki/Wedding_ring \"Wedding ring\") and a single-[diamond](/wiki/Diamond\n\"Diamond\"), [gold](/wiki/Gold \"Gold\")-banded engagement ring. The engagement\nring is usually worn on the outside.\n\nCustoms for engagement rings vary according to time, place, and culture. An\nengagement ring has historically been uncommon, and when such a gift was\ngiven, it was separate from the wedding ring.\n\nThe first recorded tradition of giving a ring for marriage is in [Genesis\n24:22](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#22) of the [Hebrew\nBible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible \"Hebrew Bible\") when a golden nose ring ([Chayei\nSarah](/wiki/Chayei_Sarah_\\(parsha\\) \"Chayei Sarah \\(parsha\\)\") 24:22) was\ngiven by [Eliezer of Damascus](/wiki/Eliezer_of_Damascus \"Eliezer of\nDamascus\") to [Rebecca](/wiki/Rebecca\n\"Rebecca\"),[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_][12] with [Saadiah\nGaon](/wiki/Saadiah_Gaon \"Saadiah Gaon\") also citing as a possible source of\nthe practice in the phrase in [Nehemiah 7:46](http://www.mechon-\nmamre.org/p/pt/pt35b07.htm#46) _be’nei tabbaot_ (children of the\nrings).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] The latter case refers to betrothal (see above) rather than\nengagement; one of the three ways in which betrothal may be effected in\n[Judaism](/wiki/Judaism \"Judaism\") is by the husband giving the bride money or\nan object of at least nominal value. In fact, it is a long-standing practice\nwithin Judaism to contract the betrothal with a ring.\n\nRomantic rings from the time of the [Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman\nEmpire\") sometimes bore clasped hands symbolizing contract,[13] from which the\nlater [Celtic](/wiki/Celt \"Celt\") [Claddagh](/wiki/Claddagh_ring \"Claddagh\nring\") symbol (two hands clasping a heart) may have evolved as a symbol of\nlove and commitment between two people. Romans believed the circle was a bond\nbetween the two people who were to be married and signified eternity, but was\nfirst practiced on the [fourth finger/ring finger](/wiki/Ring_finger \"Ring\nfinger\") by the [Romans](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman Empire\"), who believed this\nfinger to be the beginning of the _[vena amoris](/wiki/Vena_amoris \"Vena\namoris\")_ (\"vein of love\"), the vein that leads to the heart.[14] In cultures\nwith European origin, and many other countries, an [engagement\nring](/wiki/Engagement_ring \"Engagement ring\") is worn following the practice\nof the Romans who \"...wore the ring either on the right middle finger or the\nleft ring [4th] finger, from which, according to ancient Egyptian physicians,\na nerve led directly to the heart.\"[14] The custom in [Continental\nEurope](/wiki/Continental_Europe \"Continental Europe\") and other countries is\nto wear it on the right hand. One historical exception arose in monarchical\nregimes, in which a nobleman entering into [morganatic\nmarriage](/wiki/Morganatic_marriage \"Morganatic marriage\"), a marriage in\nwhich the person, usually the woman, of lower rank stayed at the same rank\ninstead of rising ranks, would present their left hand to receive the ring,\nhence the alternative term 'marriage with the left hand' (Ger. _Ehe zur linken\nHand_), the offspring of such marriages considered to be disinherited from\nbirth.[15]\n\nThe modern Western form of the practice of giving or exchanging [engagement\nrings](/wiki/Engagement_ring \"Engagement ring\") is traditionally thought to\nhave begun in 1477 when [Maximilian I, Holy Roman\nEmperor](/wiki/Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Maximilian I, Holy Roman\nEmperor\"), gave [Mary of Burgundy](/wiki/Mary_of_Burgundy \"Mary of Burgundy\")\na [diamond](/wiki/Diamond \"Diamond\") ring as an engagement present.[16]\n\nIn other countries like [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina \"Argentina\"), men and\nwomen each wear a ring similar to wedding bands. They are made of silver\n(\"alianza de plata\") when manifesting an informal \"boyfriend-girlfriend\"\nrelationship, though this first step might not always happen; howbeit\ndepending on finances, this may be the only ring given at all. The gold band\n(\"anillo de compromiso\" or \"alianza de oro\") is given to the bride when the\ncommitment is formal and the [optional] diamond ring (\"cintillo\") is reserved\nfor the wedding ceremony when the groom gives it to the bride. The gold band\nthat the groom wore during the engagement – or a new one, as some men choose\nnot to wear them during engagement – is then given to the groom by the bride;\nand the bride receives both the original gold band and the new diamond at the\nceremony. The bride's diamond ring is worn on top of the engagement band at\nthe wedding and thereafter, especially at formal occasions or parties;\notherwise the engagement band suffices for daily wear for both parties. At the\nwedding, the rings are swapped from the right to the left hand. In\n[Brazil](/wiki/Brazil \"Brazil\"), they are always made of gold, and there is no\ntradition for the engagement ring. Both men and women wear the wedding band on\ntheir right hand while engaged, and, after they marry, they shift the rings to\ntheir left hands. In [Nordic countries](/wiki/Nordic_countries \"Nordic\ncountries\") such as [Finland](/wiki/Finland \"Finland\") and\n[Norway](/wiki/Norway \"Norway\"), both men and women wear an engagement ring.\n\nIn the modern era, some women's wedding rings are made into two separate\npieces. One part is given to her to wear as an engagement ring when she\naccepts the marriage proposal and the other during the wedding ceremony. When\nworn together, the two rings look like one piece of jewelry.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nengagement ring is not worn during the wedding ceremony, when the [wedding\nring](/wiki/Wedding_ring \"Wedding ring\") is put by the groom on the finger of\nthe bride, and sometimes by the bride onto the groom's finger. After the\nwedding, the engagement ring is put back on, and is usually worn on the\noutside of the wedding ring.\n\n## Engagement\nparties[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Engagement&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Engagement parties\")]\n\nMain article: [Engagement party](/wiki/Engagement_party \"Engagement party\")\n\nSome engagements are announced at an engagement party, traditionally hosted by\nthe bride's parents. These parties are given in the family's usual style of\nentertainment. Traditionally, engagement parties were normal parties at which\na surprise announcement of the engagement was made by the father of the bride\nto his guests. Therefore, it is not a traditional gift-giving occasion since\nno guests were supposed to be aware of the engagement until after their\narrival.\n\nIn modern times, engagement parties often celebrate a previously publicized\nengagement. Whether presents are given at these engagement parties varies from\nculture to culture.\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Engagement&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[Betrothal](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Betrothal \"commons:Category:Betrothal\")**_.  \n---|---  \n  \n  1. **Jump up ^** To be precise, _nesiuin_ is the process, and _chuppah_ is the method.\n\nSources\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Kaplan, Rabbi Aryeh (1983). _Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide_.
