It tells the story of\nAkeelah Anderson ([Keke Palmer](/wiki/Keke_Palmer \"Keke Palmer\")), an 11-year-\nold girl who participates in the [Scripps National Spelling\nBee](/wiki/Scripps_National_Spelling_Bee \"Scripps National Spelling Bee\"), her\nmother ([Angela Bassett](/wiki/Angela_Bassett \"Angela Bassett\")), her\nschoolmates, and her coach, Dr. Joshua Larabee ([Laurence\nFishburne](/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne \"Laurence Fishburne\")). The cast also\nfeatures [Curtis Armstrong](/wiki/Curtis_Armstrong \"Curtis Armstrong\"), J.R.\nVillarreal, Sean Michael Afable, [Erica Hubbard](/wiki/Erica_Hubbard \"Erica\nHubbard\"), [Lee Thompson Young](/wiki/Lee_Thompson_Young \"Lee Thompson\nYoung\"), Julito McCullum, Sahara Garey, [Eddie Steeples](/wiki/Eddie_Steeples\n\"Eddie Steeples\"), and [Tzi Ma](/wiki/Tzi_Ma \"Tzi Ma\").\n\nThe film was developed over a period of 10 years by Atchison, who came up with\nthe initial concept after seeing the 1994 [Scripps National Spelling\nBee](/wiki/Scripps_National_Spelling_Bee \"Scripps National Spelling Bee\") and\nnoting that a majority of the competitors came from good socioeconomic\nbackgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the\n[Nicholl Fellowships in\nScreenwriting](/wiki/Nicholl_Fellowships_in_Screenwriting \"Nicholl Fellowships\nin Screenwriting\") in 2000, which attracted producers [Sid\nGanis](/wiki/Sid_Ganis \"Sid Ganis\") and [Nancy Hult\nGanis](/wiki/Nancy_Hult_Ganis \"Nancy Hult Ganis\"). After an initial inability\nto secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of\nthe 2002 documentary film _[Spellbound](/wiki/Spellbound_\\(2002_film\\)\n\"Spellbound \\(2002 film\\)\")_. [Lionsgate Films](/wiki/Lionsgate_Films\n\"Lionsgate Films\") undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year\nit was filmed in [South Los Angeles](/wiki/South_Los_Angeles \"South Los\nAngeles\") on a budget of over $6 million.\n\nAtchison remarked that his theme for the film, deemed an inspirational film,\nwas about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He\nalso said that he wanted to portray African Americans in a manner that was not\nstereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some\nstereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to\nproblems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in\nschool while criticizes the public school system. Cast members said that\nalthough the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important\nlessons for the parents as well.\n\nReleased in the United States on April 28, 2006, _Akeelah and the Bee_ was\npositively received by critics and audiences. Reviewers praised its storyline\nand cast, lauding Palmer's performance, although a few critics panned the\nstory as familiar and formulaic, and were critical of the portrayal of Asian-\nAmerican characters. The film grossed almost $18 million, and received a\nnumber of awards and nominations, including the [Black Reel\nAwards](/wiki/Black_Reel_Awards \"Black Reel Awards\") and the [NAACP Image\nAwards](/wiki/NAACP_Image_Award \"NAACP Image Award\"). Film critics highly\npraised it for avoiding [African-American\nstereotypes](/wiki/Stereotypes_of_African_Americans \"Stereotypes of African\nAmericans\") common in Hollywood films, while scholars were less favorable,\neven saying it reinforces some clichés.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Writing\n    * 3.2 Development\n    * 3.3 Filming\n    * 3.4 Authenticity\n    * 3.5 Music\n  * 4 Themes and analysis\n  * 5 Release and reception\n    * 5.1 Marketing and release\n    * 5.2 Home media\n    * 5.3 Critical reaction\n      * 5.3.1 Racial issues\n    * 5.4 Accolades\n  * 6 Notes\n  * 7 References\n    * 7.1 Works cited\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Plot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nAkeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old spelling enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle\nSchool, a predominantly [black school](/wiki/Black_school \"Black school\") in\n[South](/wiki/South_Los_Angeles \"South Los Angeles\") [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\"). She lives with her\n[widowed](/wiki/Widow \"Widow\") mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older\nbrothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch\nsuggests that she sign up for the Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee. She\nfollows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting\nEnglish professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and\ndecides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee.\nNevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As\na result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee.\nAlthough Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she\nqualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating.\nAkeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old [Mexican\nAmerican](/wiki/Mexican_American \"Mexican American\") boy and fellow speller.\nJavier invites her to join the spelling club at his [Woodland\nHills](/wiki/Woodland_Hills,_Los_Angeles \"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles\") middle\nschool.\n\nAt Woodland Hills, Akeelah meets Dylan Chiu, a [Chinese\nAmerican](/wiki/Chinese_American \"Chinese American\") boy who had won second\nplace at the past two national spelling bees. Contemptuous, he asks her to\nspell \"[xanthosis](/wiki/Xanthosis \"Xanthosis\")\". When she starts with a \"z\",\nhe tells her she needs a coach. At the conclusion of the spelling club\nmeeting, Javier invites Akeelah to his birthday party. At the party, Akeelah\nnearly beats Dylan in [Scrabble](/wiki/Scrabble \"Scrabble\"). The boy is\nreprimanded by his father for nearly losing to \"a little black girl\". After\nthe party, Tanya is depressed over her husband's death and concerned about her\ndaughter's grades and frequent [truancy](/wiki/Truancy \"Truancy\"). As she\nfinds out about Akeelah going alone to Woodland Hills, she subsequently\nforbids Akeelah from participating in the upcoming state bee. To circumvent\nthis prohibition, Akeelah forges her deceased father's signature on the\nconsent form and secretly studies with Dr. Larabee. During the state bee,\nTanya comes inside and interrupts her daughter before she can spell her word.\nTanya relents after a side discussion with Dr. Larabee and Mr. Welch. Javier\nprotects Akeelah from disqualification by stalling until she can return.\nDylan, Javier and Akeelah advance to the Scripps National Spelling Bee.\n\nAs Christmas approaches, Akeelah goes out to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but\nwhen she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she\nreminds him of his deceased daughter Denise. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000\nflashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia,\nand feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud,\nAkeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells her that if she looked\naround her, she would realize that she has \"50,000 coaches\". Akeelah recruits\nher family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to\nprepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to\n[Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\") with him, along\nwith Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for\nfour of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she\ninvites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After\nall the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The\ntwo finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's\nfather harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to [intentionally\nlose](/wiki/Match_fixing \"Match fixing\") by deliberately misspelling\n\"xanthosis\". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally\nmisspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition,\nrejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every\nword listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together,\nwith Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling \"logorrhea\", much to\nhis father's delight. Akeelah spells the last word on the list, \"pulchritude\",\nand the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Laurence_Fishburne_2009_-_cropped.jpg/200px-\nLaurence_Fishburne_2009_-_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:Laurence_Fishburne_2009_-_cropped.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Angela_Bassett_by_Gage_Skidmoe.jpg/200px-\nAngela_Bassett_by_Gage_Skidmoe.jpg)](/wiki/File:Angela_Bassett_by_Gage_Skidmoe.jpg)\n\nLaurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett were the protagonists along with Keke\nPalmer. Both were attracted by its history; Fishburne said he was \"really\nmoved by it\", and Bassett \"just loved\" it.[5][6]\n\n  * [Keke Palmer](/wiki/Keke_Palmer \"Keke Palmer\") as Akeelah Anderson:\n\n    Three hundred girls auditioned for the role of Akeelah in Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta,[7] with Palmer having auditioned five times to get the part.[8][9] Atchison liked Palmer's acting, but the major factor in choosing her was the fact that at only age ten Palmer already had a profound interpretation of the script.[9] He chose her as he did not want a kid whom he would command but instead someone with whom he could have a collaboration: someone who would understand the role and \"would make this character her own.\"[10] He just assisted her to fully ensure that she would understand the character's feelings and would make \"the right emotional choices.\"[11]\n\n  * [Laurence Fishburne](/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne \"Laurence Fishburne\") as Dr. Joshua Larabee:\n\n    Fishburne was pleased by the concept of the film, stating he was \"really moved by it\", so that he accepted to take his part \"at an affordable rate\", according to producer Michael Romersa.[5] He first read the script in 2002 and moved by the fact that \"there were very few people with the courage\" to \"make this kind of movie\"[b] he also accepted to be a producer for the film.[14] About the character, Atchison said that Larabee is \"vulnerable\" and \"a very sensitive guy\" that has \"a quiet moral authority\".[15] He also asserted that Fishburne made Larabee \"a fairly buttoned-up, stoic type\" and \"subtly more animated\" than how he envisioned the character.[16] Larabee is based upon a teacher, Robert Larabell, Atchison had in [Phoenix, Arizona](/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona \"Phoenix, Arizona\").[14][17]\n\n  * [Angela Bassett](/wiki/Angela_Bassett \"Angela Bassett\") as Tanya Anderson:\n\n    Bassett's agent sent her the script which she \"just loved.\"[6][18] Atchison praised Bassett's portrayal of the character, asserting she \"made Tanya a real person\" after understanding \"the thought process of the character\".[5] The director said Tanya wants the best for Akeelah but is reticent because she thinks \"the dream will fail and make things worse.\"[19] Bassett stressed that her character has to handle the pain of her husband's death in addition to having bills paid[18] but that Tanya \"gain[s] some measure of courage herself\" inspired by Akeelah.[6]\n\n  * [Curtis Armstrong](/wiki/Curtis_Armstrong \"Curtis Armstrong\") as Bob Welch:\n\n    Atchison pointed Armstrong \"was the perfect choice for the school principal.\" About his character role in the film, he said, \"Welch is very excitable and provides a lot of the comic relief in our story.\"[20]\n\n  * J.R. Villarreal as Javier Mendez:\n\n    Villarreal was chosen by scouts at the [Sheraton Hotel](/wiki/Sheraton_Hotels_and_Resorts \"Sheraton Hotels and Resorts\") in south [McAllen](/wiki/McAllen,_Texas \"McAllen, Texas\") to go to the next phase in Dallas.[21] After doing well in Dallas, he was sent to auditions in California and finally got the part.[22] He commented that \"Javier is a very good friend to Akeelah ... And also like his charisma, his character, he can always put a smile on your face. He really doesn't care what people think of him that much and he helps Akeelah out with that little matter because she cares very much of what people think about her.\"[23]\n\n  * Sean Michael Afable as Dylan Chiu:\n\n    Afable argued that his character can be \"sometimes harsh and seemingly cutthroat\", but this is because of the pressure his father puts on him, noting Dylan's \"true character\" is seen at the end of the film.[24]\n\n  * Sahara Garey as Georgia Carver\n\n    Garey did \"about six auditions\" to take the role.[25] She commented that about her character: \"she encourages Akeelah, because she sees so many qualities in her that she doesn't think she herself has. Georgia aims lower, but she encourages Akeelah to aim higher.\"[26]\n\n[Erica Hubbard](/wiki/Erica_Hubbard \"Erica Hubbard\"), [Lee Thompson\nYoung](/wiki/Lee_Thompson_Young \"Lee Thompson Young\"), and Julito McCullum\nportray Akeelah's sister and brothers Kiana, Devon, and Terrence,\nrespectively.[27] Dalia Phillips appears as Akeelah's teacher, Ms.\nCross,[27][1] and [Eddie Steeples](/wiki/Eddie_Steeples \"Eddie Steeples\") as\nDerrick T.[27] [Tzi Ma](/wiki/Tzi_Ma \"Tzi Ma\") takes the role of Mr. Chiu,\nDylan's father,[27][1] while [Wolfgang Bodison](/wiki/Wolfgang_Bodison\n\"Wolfgang Bodison\") plays the deceased Akeelah's unnamed father.[27]\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nWriting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Writing\")]\n\nDoug Atchison first had the idea of making a film about spelling bees after\nwatching the [Scripps National Spelling\nBee](/wiki/Scripps_National_Spelling_Bee \"Scripps National Spelling Bee\") of\n1994 and noticing that most of the contestants had \"privileged\nbackgrounds\".[28] Atchison also considered spelling bees to contain \"all the\ndrama and tension and entertainment value of a sporting event\", and felt that\nthis could be made into a film.[29][30] From this, he got the idea to write a\nscript following the story of a child who had talent for spelling bee but was\nfrom a low-income neighborhood so did not \"have access to the resources or\ncoaching to pursue it as these other kids had.\"[11][28] He had the desire of\nmaking a \"_[Rocky](/wiki/Rocky \"Rocky\")_ -like story\" and although made it a\n\"dramatic\" plot, he declared it is \"essentially a sports movie\".[11]\n\nAtchison started his screenplay in 1999, when he wrote a five-page\n[treatment](/wiki/Film_treatment \"Film treatment\") in about a month.[28][29]\nIn addition to the fact he was working on other projects, Atchison said he\nwaited years before starting to write because he \"thought someone else would\ndo it first.\" This did not happen, so he began to write by himself.[30] Few\nchanges were made in the process of transitioning from the original draft to\nthe final product. One change was that at first, Akeelah's mother had a\nsmaller role and Akeelah's father was alive. Also, Larabee had been an older\nman (72 years old), and a few characters were cut. However, Atchison has\nsummarized that \"the steps she goes through, the friends she's got, those were\nalways the same.\"[29]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nIn 2000, Atchison submitted his script to the [Academy of Motion Picture Arts\nand Sciences](/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences \"Academy of\nMotion Picture Arts and Sciences\") along with about 4,500 others, in hopes of\nwinning the [Nicholl Fellowships in\nScreenwriting](/wiki/Nicholl_Fellowships_in_Screenwriting \"Nicholl Fellowships\nin Screenwriting\"). Atchison's script ended up being one of five scripts\nselected, and he won the grant.[28][31] Editor [Glenn Farr](/wiki/Glenn_Farr\n\"Glenn Farr\"), then a member of the committee, offered to edit Atchison's film\nas soon as it was finished.[16] Producer [Sid Ganis](/wiki/Sid_Ganis \"Sid\nGanis\") was also attracted to the story during the award presentation\nceremony.[28] [Nancy Hult Ganis](/wiki/Nancy_Hult_Ganis \"Nancy Hult Ganis\"),\nSid's wife who was interested in public education, encouraged him to follow\nthrough with the film.[7]\n\nThe film was produced by [Lionsgate Films](/wiki/Lionsgate_Films \"Lionsgate\nFilms\"), [2929 Entertainment](/wiki/2929_Entertainment \"2929 Entertainment\"),\n[Starbucks Entertainment](/wiki/Starbucks_Entertainment \"Starbucks\nEntertainment\"), Out of the Blue Entertainment, Reactor Films and Cinema Gypsy\nProductions,[a] with a budget around $6–8 million.[3][4] However, the Ganis\ncouple found it difficult to secure funding for the film.[7] In August 2001,\nDanny Llewelyn's Panoptic Pictures acquired the rights of Atchison's\nscript.[32] In 2002, documentary _[Spellbound](/wiki/Spellbound_\\(2002_film\\)\n\"Spellbound \\(2002 film\\)\")_ was released and attracted attention to spelling\nbees, which, according to Hult Ganis, \"helped us in some way\".[7] In November\n2004, Lionsgate Films announced they would fund and distribute the film;[33]\nand in collaboration with 2929 Entertainment they would co-finance the\nproduction.[34] In January 2006, Starbucks announced a partnership with\nLionsgate to market it.[35]\n\nAnother factor in not having a studio attached before was Atchison's desire to\ndirect it as he wanted to ensure his story would remain the one he envisioned.\nSeveral studios wanted to turn Larabee's character into a white character but\nAtchison felt \"it was important that Akeelah's mentor be someone that comes\nfrom her neighborhood, that looks like her.\"[11] Lionsgate's President of\nProduction Michael Paseornek agreed that Atchison should direct the script,\nclaiming that he was the only person who could do it because the story \"was in\nhis heart and in his mind\".[7]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\nFilming began in February 2005;[36] the crew filmed for ten hours a day for\nthirty-one days.[20][29] The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United\nStates' [child labor laws](/wiki/Child_labor_laws_in_the_United_States \"Child\nlabor laws in the United States\"), which necessitated spending at least three\nhours a day at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch.[20][29]\nNevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis\ncommented, \"I honestly don't know how we figured it out, but we did\".[20] To\nget the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time\nand chatted with cinematographer [David Mullen](/wiki/M._David_Mullen \"M.\nDavid Mullen\"), the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to\ncompile a list of scenes.[29] This way, the filming team began each day\nknowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances\nscheduled for each day.[20][29] Most of the filming took place in [South Los\nAngeles](/wiki/South_Los_Angeles \"South Los Angeles\"),[20] which Atchison\npicked as the filming location due to their low budget.[9] Scenes were also\nfilmed at the [University of Southern\nCalifornia](/wiki/University_of_Southern_California \"University of Southern\nCalifornia\"), [Hollywood Palladium](/wiki/Hollywood_Palladium \"Hollywood\nPalladium\")—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C.\nHyatt Hotel—and [Venice High School](/wiki/Venice_High_School_\\(Los_Angeles\\)\n\"Venice High School \\(Los Angeles\\)\").[37]\n\n###\nAuthenticity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Authenticity\")]\n\nTo bring authenticity to the film's portrayal of spelling bees, George\nHornedo, who competed in spelling bees in real life, was hired to play\ncontestant Roman and be \"an unofficial technical consultant.\" Hornedo helped\nthe actors to recreate \"certain habits and idiosyncrasies they do on stage to\nhelp them spell.\"[37] Thus, Akeelah skipping rope to memorize the words was\nadded as \"something that was normal for the spelling bee\" but Atchison tried\nto create it in a \"subtle\" way as he thought the audience could consider this\nunrealistic.[38] Hornedo and other children who had never acted before were\ncast because of their authentic portrayals of nervous contestants; other kids,\nin Atchison's eyes, were \"too old in how they acted\".[30] Also, [Jacques\nBailly](/wiki/Jacques_Bailly \"Jacques Bailly\"), who won the Scripps National\nSpelling Bee in 1980 and is currently the contest's official pronouncer, since\n2003, played himself in the film.[39]\n\nTo further help the staff, Atchison asked Paige Kimball, director of the\nScripps National Spelling Bee, to be a consultant. Kimball \"was amazed at not\nonly at how precise it was in its recreation, but also how authentic the\nindividuals and the casting for the event was.\"[37] However, she and the\norganization did have some disagreements. Atchison has admitted that he\noriginally created a more dramatic story than she wanted. However, he believed\nmost of the disagreements were about technical procedures, \"things you\nwouldn't even notice\". For example, the children were originally sponsored by\nnewspapers to compete, but Atchison felt this detail did not improve the\nstory, so he removed it. There were some concerns about the screenplay, and\nAtchison changed some of them \"because [he] thought it didn't matter one way\nor another so [he] just made them happy.\"[29]\n\n### Music[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\nThe film features a musical score by [Aaron Zigman](/wiki/Aaron_Zigman \"Aaron\nZigman\"), who wrote 45 minutes of compositions in two and a half weeks. He had\nplanned to score _Akeelah and the Bee_ over the holidays, but Lionsgate pushed\nits release date up, so Zigman was pressed for time to write the score.[40] He\ndrew inspiration from Fishburne's performance to write it.[41] A soundtrack\nalbum consisting of 16 tracks was released by Lionsgate Records in a deal with\n[BMG](/wiki/Bertelsmann_Music_Group \"Bertelsmann Music Group\")'s [RED\nDistribution](/wiki/RED_Distribution \"RED Distribution\") on April 4,\n2006.[42][43] It peaked at number 193 on the [_Billboard_\n200](/wiki/Billboard_200 \"Billboard 200\"), and reached the 19th and sixth spot\non the [_Billboard_ Top Independent\nAlbums](/wiki/Billboard_Top_Independent_Albums \"Billboard Top Independent\nAlbums\") and Top Soundtracks respectively.[44] The original score, consisting\nof 37 tracks, was also released on April 4 as an [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes\n\"ITunes\") exclusive.[45][46]\n\n## Themes and\nanalysis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Themes and analysis\")]\n\n“ | If you see African-American kids striving to do something in the movies, it's sports or singing or dancing. Here, we're engaging kids on their intellect. That, you don't see. These lies about black inferiority have been seeping into cinema, and that seeps into our kids. As a filmmaker, you can dig into these issues | ”  \n---|---|---  \n— Doug Atchison[3]  \n  \nCommentators on _Akeelah and the Bee_ opined it dealt with multiple themes,\nincluding race[47] and racism,[48] poverty,[49] educational system,[50][51]\ncompetition and sportsmanship,[51][52] self-esteem,[53] [self-\nimage](/wiki/Self-image \"Self-image\"),[54] stigma,[50] community,[50][55]\nfriendship,[56] gender[47] and sexism,[49] age,[47] [class](/wiki/Social_class\n\"Social class\")[57] and classism,[48] and [empowerment](/wiki/Empowerment\n\"Empowerment\").[50] Atchison affirmed that its focus is not the spelling but\n\"a kid who learns what she's good at, becomes proud of that and doesn't want\nto hide it anymore. It's overcoming the fear of being great, before you can be\ngreat.\"[58] Sid Ganis described it as a film \"about hope and doing great\nthings against all the odds,\"[7] while a _[New York\nPress](/wiki/New_York_Press \"New York Press\")_ reviewer declared it \"addresses\nthe human condition\".[57]\n\nAfter attending USC School of Cinematic Arts and working at a youth center in\nSouth Los Angeles,[29] Atchison incorporated his experiences from the\nneighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who do well in\nschool are said to be \"[acting white](/wiki/Acting_white \"Acting white\")\". As\na result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to\ndoubt their own abilities.[30] This doubts are shown through the\npreconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that \"Spelling Bee is\nfor someone else\".[34] She \"must first overcome her feelings of\ninadequacy,\"[34] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood\nand is a successful man, it \"empowers her to ... accomplish this task.\"[7]\nFishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of\nstruggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold\nagainst black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated,\n\"it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen\npeople who look like her doing\".[3] The director affirmed that African\nAmerican children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being\nsuccessful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has\ndisseminated \"lies about black inferiority\", so he was interested in focusing\nin their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison\nnoted he had created the project for all publics \"but particularly for kids\n[of color](/wiki/Person_of_color \"Person of color\") to see a little black girl\nwho does something powerful.\"[3]\n\nThe director also attributed Akeelah's low-esteem and doubt on her own\ncapacities to the public school system, where she is bullied and \"her\nintellectual curiosity is kind of crushed\".[11] As such, Akeelah is portrayed\nas \"undermotivated student\",[1] who \"[u]nwilling to be stigmatized as a freak\nor a brainiac,\" avoids showing her abilities.[50] According to Wesley Morris\nof _[The Boston Globe](/wiki/The_Boston_Globe \"The Boston Globe\")_ , the film\nshows \"the contradiction gifted students feel in an inhospitable\nenvironment.\"[59] Ann Hornaday from _[The Washington\nPost](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_ opined that Akeelah's\nsentence \"Why would I want to represent a school that doesn't even have doors\non the toilets?\" is \"one of the film's many subtle critiques of the country's\neducation policies.\"[55] Writing in the _[English\nJournal](/wiki/English_Journal \"English Journal\")_ , Amanda L. Hodges said it\nsuggests a new approach on teaching with the \"50,000 coaches\" part; she\ndeclared it deconstructs the image of teachers \"as those who keep order and\ndisseminate knowledge\" and shows that \"[t]eaching is not an isolated activity\nthat begins and ends at the classroom door.\"[60]\n\nVillarreal commented that the film \"teaches you not to let your friends\ndown\",[56] while Fishburne believed that the theme of community was\nimportant.[5] Marrit Ingman of _[The Austin\nChronicle](/wiki/The_Austin_Chronicle \"The Austin Chronicle\")_ said the film\nindicates \"a community-based, cooperative model of group success,\"[51] while\nJustin Chang of _[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_\nsaid it \"focuses ... on the bee's community-uniting impact.\"[1] Hodges said\nAkeelah goes to the spelling bee because she recognizes it \"proves that\nsomeone from their neighborhood can achieve success, and her achievementis, in\na real sense, their own\".[60] In contrast, Bernard Beck wrote for\n_Multicultural Perspectives_ that it depicts \"the success of individual\nperseverance\",[61] while _Red Feather Journall_ 's Kathryn Linder expressed a\nsimilar opinion about individual success.[62] Nevertheless, [Kenneth\nTuran](/wiki/Kenneth_Turan \"Kenneth Turan\") of the _Los Angeles Times_\ncommented \"it raises important points about the ... obstacles to success that\nkids from poor neighborhoods face.\"[50] The _New York Press_ 's reviewer went\nfurther and said social class was its \"real subject\" as it \"depicts the basics\nof class mobility that are routinely taken for granted\".[57] However, Chang\nasserted it shows the spelling bee contest as \"a democratizing force\",[1]\nwhile Rob Asghar, for _[The Seattle Times](/wiki/The_Seattle_Times \"The\nSeattle Times\")_ , wrote it treats English as \"the quintessential American\ntool for success.\"[63]\n\nBoth Fishburne and Bassett also remarked that an important message of _Akeelah\nand the Bee_ is to \"speak properly\" rather than strictly in vernacular,\nalthough Bassett emphasized the importance of the film's themes beyond\nspelling and spelling bees.[14][18] Atchison added that beyond learning how to\nspell words, Akeelah must learn the importance of the words. He said that\nLarabee \"looks at Akeelah as a potential leader. He wants her to understand\nher history. She needs to know the importance of language – and\ncompetition.\"[30] In spite of knowing its importance, it \"deconstruct[s] the\n'competition' paradigm of learning\", according to Ingman.[51] Fishburne noted\nnot only children but parents can learn from the film; in his opinion, the\nmost important is that they should pay attention to their children's\nabilities.[14] Villarreal also felt that, through Dylan's father, parents\nwould be able to ponder if they are \"push[ing] their kids to follow their own\ndreams and not the children's dreams.\"[23]\n\n## Release and\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Release and reception\")]\n\n### Marketing and\nrelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Marketing and release\")]\n\nThe film was promoted by coffee shop chain [Starbucks](/wiki/Starbucks\n\"Starbucks\") as a result of a partnership between [Lions Gate\nEntertainment](/wiki/Lions_Gate_Entertainment \"Lions Gate Entertainment\") and\nStarbucks Entertainment.[64] In January 2006, approximately 8,300 Starbucks\nlocations in the United States and Canada began a promotional campaign for the\nfilm involving spelling-related trivia games and promotions on cardboard cup\nsleeves.[35][65] _[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ stated that Lionsgate spent around $20 million with its market\nonly,[66] while _[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles\nTimes\")_ reported a $25 million cost to both produce and market the film.[67]\n[Ford Motor Company](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford Motor Company\") also\nsponsored the film by providing a [Lincoln Zephyr](/wiki/Lincoln_MKZ \"Lincoln\nMKZ\") to chauffeur the cast and creators to and from a screening.[68]\n\n_Akeelah and the Bee_ was first shown at the 2006 [ShoWest](/wiki/ShoWest\n\"ShoWest\") on March 14,[69] and later premiered as the opening film at the\n30th [Cleveland International Film\nFestival](/wiki/Cleveland_International_Film_Festival \"Cleveland International\nFilm Festival\") on March 16.[70] On April 20, the film was screened at [The\nAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and\nSciences](/wiki/The_Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences \"The Academy\nof Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\") in Beverly Hills,[68] and it had a\n[sneak preview](/wiki/Sneak_preview \"Sneak preview\") in 900 theaters on April\n22.[64][71] With predictions of strong box office returns by film\ncritics,[64][72] it was released nationwide in theaters on April 28, grossing\n$6,011,585 in its opening weekend from around 2,195 American theaters and\nranking eighth at the box office.[4] The film closed its run on July 14 and 20\ndomestically and internationally respectively, with $18,848,430 domestically\nand $110,994 internationally.[4] While the film received positive reviews,\ncritics noted that it was not doing as well financially as they had\npredicted,[73][74] and Lionsgate's Michael Burns characterized the film's\ngross with the word \"only\".[75]\n\nOutside the United States, the film debuted at the Sprockets Toronto\nInternational Film Festival for Children on April 23, 2006,[76] where it was\nelected the best film by the kids in the ages of 10 and 11.[77] In the United\nKingdom, _Akeelah and the Bee_ was first shown at the [Cambridge Film\nFestival](/wiki/Cambridge_Film_Festival \"Cambridge Film Festival\") on July\n7,[78] and it premiered in the British theaters on August 18.[79][80] The film\nwas also screened in October 2006 at the [Rome Film\nFestival](/wiki/Rome_Film_Festival \"Rome Film Festival\"), in which it competed\nat the Alicy in the City section.[81]\n\n### Home\nmedia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Akeelah_and_the_Bee&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Home media\")]\n\nThe film was released on DVD by [Lionsgate Home\nEntertainment](/wiki/Lionsgate_Home_Entertainment \"Lionsgate Home\nEntertainment\") on August 29, becoming the first [DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\")\noffered for sale at Starbucks.[82] Its bonus features on the single-disc DVD\ninclude seven deleted scenes and a 25-minute making-of video featuring\nAtchinson and the cast.[83] DVD sales in the United States reached $5,391,947\nas 317,942 copies were sold after one week on sale.

[critical discourse analysis](/wiki/Critical_discourse_analysis \"Critical\ndiscourse analysis\"), the authors argue that despite appearing to be an\n\"inoccent enough\" film, it has major approaches that make it racist.[110]\nFirst, it implies that African-Americans needs to be rescued by others;[110]\nsecond, depicts African-Americans community as \"marked by homelessness,\npoverty, criminality, unemployment, and remnants of gang activity\";[111]\nthird, indicates that black people usually only achieve success through sports\nby \"linking the very essence of Akeelah's phenomenal ability to

September 2011 paper \"Spelling Out Racial Difference: Moving\nBeyond the Inspirational Discourses in _Akeelah and the Bee_ \", also\ncriticizes it saying it \"acts as a platform for a racial melodrama through\nwhich ideals of whiteness are reinforced and strengthened.\"[114] Using [Linda\nWilliams](/wiki/Linda_Williams_\\(film_scholar\\) \"Linda Williams \\(film\nscholar\\)\")' categories of what constitutes a racial\n[melodrama](/wiki/Melodrama \"Melodrama\"), Linder argues that it is described\nas an \"inspirational\" film because of \"[its] portrayal of Akeelah's\nvictimization by the black community that surrounds her\" and of redemption\nonly achieved \"through the idealized discourse of young people's educational\nsuccess as defined by dominant (white) culture.\"[115] Linder said characters\n\"are mostly represented as having 'no interest in escape' from societal\noppressions and limitations\" and that \"there is no sign throughout the film of\nany kind of lasting change for Akeelah's school or her young peers.\"[116]\n\nLinder affirms that it creates a dichotomy between \"success (whiteness) versus\nfailure (blackness).\"[116] Pimentel and Sawyer, as well as Linder, identify\nLarabee as the one who makes this separation clear when he manifests his\ndisregard of [African American Vernacular\nEnglish](/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English \"African American\nVernacular English\").[117][111] The co-authors wrote that Larabee implies that\n\"legitimate forms of intelligence can only be achieved through a Eurocentric\nperspective, thus advancing the message that Akeelah must be rescued from her\nAfrican-American ways of knowing, in order to be considered\nintellectual.\"[111] Another contraposition commented by scholars was \"between\nthe supportive Dr. Larabee and Akeelah's skeptical mother.\"[118] Pimental and\nSawyer said she is portrayed as \"an African-American obstructionist\",[119]\nwhile scholar Gloria Ladson‐Billings asserted she represents the stereotype of\n\"ignorant Black woman\".[120] Although Fuchs said the film was able to avoid\nthe \"[white authority figure saves the underclass\nchild](/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film \"White savior narrative in film\")\"\nplotline by introducing Larabee,[99] Ladson‐Billings, Linder, and Pimentel and\nSawyer opined that it did not.[119][120] After all, Larabee, as Linder\ndescribed, is \"a non-threatening black man who has assimilated to white\nculture and who can be depended on to help assimilate
