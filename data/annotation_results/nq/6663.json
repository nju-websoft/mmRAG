**history of New Zealand** dates back at least 700 years to when it was\ndiscovered and settled by [Polynesians](/wiki/Polynesia \"Polynesia\"), who\ndeveloped a distinct [Māori culture](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_culture \"Māori culture\")\ncentred on kinship links and land. The first European explorer to sight [New\nZealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\") was Dutch navigator [Abel\nTasman](/wiki/Abel_Tasman \"Abel Tasman\") on 13 December 1642.[1] The Dutch\nwere also the first non-natives to explore and chart New Zealand's coastline.\nCaptain [James Cook](/wiki/James_Cook \"James Cook\"), who reached New Zealand\nin October 1769 on the first of his three voyages,[2] was the first European\nexplorer to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century,\nthe country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors,\nmissionaries, traders and adventurers. In 1840 the [Treaty of\nWaitangi](/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi \"Treaty of Waitangi\") was signed between\nthe British Crown and various Māori chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the\n[British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") and giving Māori the\nsame rights as British subjects. There was extensive British settlement\nthroughout the rest of the century and into the early part of the next\ncentury. War and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to\nmost of New Zealand's land passing from Māori to\n[Pākehā](/wiki/P%C4%81keh%C4%81 \"Pākehā\") (European) ownership, and most Māori\nsubsequently became impoverished.[3]\n\nFrom the 1890s the [New Zealand Parliament](/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament \"New\nZealand Parliament\") enacted a number of progressive initiatives, including\n[women's suffrage](/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_New_Zealand \"Women's suffrage\nin New Zealand\") and [old age pensions](/wiki/Old_age_pensions \"Old age\npensions\"). The country remained an enthusiastic member of the British Empire,\nand 110,000 men fought in [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\") (see\n[New Zealand Expeditionary Force](/wiki/New_Zealand_Expeditionary_Force \"New\nZealand Expeditionary Force\")). After the war New Zealand signed the [Treaty\nof Versailles](/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles \"Treaty of Versailles\") (1919),\njoined the [League of Nations](/wiki/League_of_Nations \"League of Nations\"),\nand pursued an independent foreign policy, while its defence was still\ncontrolled by Britain.\n\nWhen [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") broke out in 1939, New\nZealanders contributed to the defence of the British Empire; the country\ncontributed some 120,000 troops. From the 1930s the economy was highly\nregulated and an extensive [welfare state](/wiki/Welfare_in_New_Zealand\n\"Welfare in New Zealand\") was developed. Meanwhile, Māori culture underwent a\nrenaissance, and from the 1950s Māori began moving to the cities in large\nnumbers. This led to the development of a [Māori protest\nmovement](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_protest_movement \"Māori protest movement\") which in\nturn led to greater recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi in the late 20th\ncentury.\n\nThe country's economy suffered in the aftermath of the [1973 global energy\ncrisis](/wiki/1973_oil_crisis \"1973 oil crisis\"), the loss of New Zealand's\nbiggest export market upon Britain's entry to the [European Economic\nCommunity](/wiki/European_Economic_Community \"European Economic Community\"),\nand rampant inflation. In 1984, the [Fourth Labour\nGovernment](/wiki/Fourth_Labour_Government_of_New_Zealand \"Fourth Labour\nGovernment of New Zealand\") was elected amid a [constitutional and economic\ncrisis](/wiki/1984_New_Zealand_constitutional_crisis \"1984 New Zealand\nconstitutional crisis\"). The interventionist policies of the [Third National\nGovernment](/wiki/Third_National_Government_of_New_Zealand \"Third National\nGovernment of New Zealand\") were replaced by \"[Rogernomics](/wiki/Rogernomics\n\"Rogernomics\")\", a commitment to a [free market](/wiki/Free_market \"Free\nmarket\") economy. Foreign policy after 1980 became more independent especially\nin pushing for a [nuclear-free zone](/wiki/New_Zealand_nuclear-free_zone \"New\nZealand nuclear-free zone\"). Subsequent governments have generally maintained\nthese policies, although tempering the free market ethos somewhat.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Māori arrival and settlement\n  * 2 Early contact periods\n    * 2.1 Early European exploration\n    * 2.2 European settlement\n    * 2.3 Māori response\n  * 3 British sovereignty\n    * 3.1 Treaty of Waitangi\n    * 3.2 The colonisation project\n  * 4 Growth, conflict and depression\n    * 4.1 Colonial self-government, 1850s\n    * 4.2 Farming and mining\n    * 4.3 Women\n    * 4.4 Schools\n    * 4.5 Immigration\n    * 4.6 Māori adaptation and resistance\n    * 4.7 South Island predominance\n  * 5 Liberal to Labour\n    * 5.1 Liberal asendancy, 1890s\n    * 5.2 The state steps in\n    * 5.3 Economic developments\n    * 5.4 Dominion status\n    * 5.5 Temperance and prohibition\n    * 5.6 First World War\n    * 5.7 Imperial loyalties\n    * 5.8 Great Depression\n    * 5.9 Building the welfare state\n    * 5.10 Second World War\n  * 6 The later 20th century\n    * 6.1 National in power\n    * 6.2 The British connection\n    * 6.3 Māori urbanisation\n    * 6.4 The Muldoon years, 1975–1984\n    * 6.5 The radical 1980s reforms\n    * 6.6 Continuing reform under National\n  * 7 21st century\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Further reading\n  * 11 External links\n\n## Māori arrival and\nsettlement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Māori arrival and settlement\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Polynesian_Migration.svg/300px-\nPolynesian_Migration.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Polynesian_Migration.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Polynesian_Migration.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPolynesian expansion (from [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\") to the Polynesian\ntriangle.)\n\nNew Zealand was originally settled by [Polynesians](/wiki/Polynesians\n\"Polynesians\") from [Eastern Polynesia](/wiki/Eastern_Polynesia \"Eastern\nPolynesia\"). Genetic and archaeological evidence suggests that humans\nemigrated from [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\") to [Melanesia](/wiki/Melanesia\n\"Melanesia\") and then travelled east through to the [Society\nIslands](/wiki/Society_Islands \"Society Islands\"); after a pause of 70 to 265\nyears, a new wave of exploration led to the discovery and settlement of New\nZealand.[4] The most current reliable evidence strongly indicates that initial\nsettlement of New Zealand occurred around 1280 CE.[4] Previous dating of some\n[Kiore (Polynesian rat)](/wiki/Kiore \"Kiore\") bones at 50 – 150 CE has now\nbeen shown to have been unreliable; new samples of bone (and now also of\nunequivocally rat-gnawed woody seed cases) match the 1280 CE date of the\nearliest archaeological sites and the beginning of sustained, anthropogenic\ndeforestation.[5]\n\nThe descendants of these settlers became known as the\n[Māori](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people \"Māori people\"), forming a distinct culture of\ntheir own. The separate settlement of the tiny [Chatham\nIslands](/wiki/Chatham_Islands \"Chatham Islands\") in the east of New Zealand\nabout 1500 CE produced the [Moriori](/wiki/Moriori \"Moriori\"); linguistic\nevidence indicates that the Moriori were mainland Māori who ventured\neastward.[6]\n\nThe original settlers quickly exploited the abundant large game in New\nZealand, such as [moa](/wiki/Moa \"Moa\"), which were large\n[flightless](/wiki/Flightless_bird \"Flightless bird\") [ratites](/wiki/Ratite\n\"Ratite\") pushed to [extinction](/wiki/Extinction \"Extinction\") by about 1500.\nAs moa and other large game became scarce or extinct, Māori culture underwent\nmajor change, with regional differences. In areas where it was possible to\ngrow [taro](/wiki/Taro \"Taro\") and [kūmara](/wiki/Sweet_potato \"Sweet\npotato\"), horticulture became more important. This was not possible in the\nsouth of the South Island, but wild plants such as fernroot were often\navailable and cabbage trees were harvested and cultivated for food. Warfare\nalso increased in importance, reflecting increased competition for land and\nother resources. In this period, fortified [pā](/wiki/Pa_\\(Maori\\) \"Pa\n\\(Maori\\)\") became more common, although there is debate about the actual\nfrequency of warfare. As elsewhere in the Pacific,\n[cannibalism](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\") was part of warfare.[7]\n\n[![Māori whānau from Rotorua in the\n1880s](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Famille_Maori_1998-1361-139.jpg/220px-\nFamille_Maori_1998-1361-139.jpg)](/wiki/File:Famille_Maori_1998-1361-139.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Famille_Maori_1998-1361-139.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMāori whānau from [Rotorua](/wiki/Rotorua \"Rotorua\") in the 1880s. Many\naspects of Western life and culture, including European clothing and\narchitecture, became incorporated into Māori society during the 19th century.\n\nLeadership was based on a system of chieftainship, which was often but not\nalways hereditary, although chiefs (male or female) needed to demonstrate\nleadership abilities to avoid being superseded by more dynamic individuals.\nThe most important units of pre-European Māori society were the\n[whānau](/wiki/Wh%C4%81nau \"Whānau\") or extended family, and the\n[hapū](/wiki/Hap%C5%AB \"Hapū\") or group of whānau. After these came the\n[iwi](/wiki/Iwi \"Iwi\") or tribe, consisting of groups of hapū. Related hapū\nwould often trade goods and co-operate on major projects, but conflict between\nhapū was also relatively common. Traditional Māori society preserved history\n[orally](/wiki/Oral_history \"Oral history\") through narratives, songs, and\nchants; skilled experts could recite the tribal genealogies\n(_[whakapapa](/wiki/Whakapapa \"Whakapapa\")_) back for hundreds of years. Arts\nincluded whaikōrero ([oratory](/wiki/Public_speaking \"Public speaking\")), song\ncomposition in multiple genres, dance forms including [haka](/wiki/Haka\n\"Haka\"), as well as weaving, highly developed wood carving, and [tā\nmoko](/wiki/T%C4%81_moko \"Tā moko\") (tattoo).\n\nNew Zealand has no native land mammals (apart from some rare bats) so birds,\nfish and sea mammals were important sources of protein. Māori cultivated food\nplants which they had brought with them from Polynesia, including [sweet\npotatoes](/wiki/Sweet_potatoes \"Sweet potatoes\") (called kūmara),\n[taro](/wiki/Taro \"Taro\"), [gourds](/wiki/Gourds \"Gourds\"), and\n[yams](/wiki/Yam_\\(vegetable\\) \"Yam \\(vegetable\\)\"). They also cultivated the\n[cabbage tree](/wiki/Cabbage_tree_\\(Cordyline_australis\\) \"Cabbage tree\n\\(Cordyline australis\\)\"), a plant endemic to New Zealand, and exploited wild\nfoods such as fern root, which provided a starchy paste.\n\n## Early contact\nperiods[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Early contact periods\")]\n\n### Early European\nexploration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Early European exploration\")]\n\n[![Map depicts the western and northern coast of Australia \\(labelled \"Nova\nHollandia\"\\), Tasmania \\(\"Van Diemen's Land\"\\) and part of New Zealand's North\nIsland \\(labelled \"Nova\nZeelandia\"\\).](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Thevenot_-\n_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png/220px-Thevenot_-\n_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png)](/wiki/File:Thevenot_-\n_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png)\n\nAn early map of [Australasia](/wiki/Australasia \"Australasia\") during the\nGolden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s–1720s).

The track of the _[Endeavour](/wiki/HMS_Endeavour \"HMS Endeavour\")_\nis also shown.\n\nThe first Europeans known to reach New Zealand were the crew of Dutch explorer\n[Abel Tasman](/wiki/Abel_Tasman \"Abel Tasman\") who arrived in his ships\n_Heemskerck_ and _Zeehaen_. Tasman anchored at the northern end of the [South\nIsland](/wiki/South_Island \"South Island\") in [Golden Bay](/wiki/Golden_Bay\n\"Golden Bay\") (he named it Murderers' Bay) in December 1642 and sailed\nnorthward to [Tonga](/wiki/Tonga \"Tonga\") following an attack by local Māori.\nTasman sketched sections of the two main islands' west coasts. Tasman called\nthem _Staten Landt_ , after the _[States General of the\nNetherlands](/wiki/States_General_of_the_Netherlands \"States General of the\nNetherlands\")_ , and that name appeared on his first maps of the country. In\n1645 Dutch cartographers changed the name to _Nova Zeelandia_ in Latin, from\n_Nieuw Zeeland_ , after the [Dutch province](/wiki/Seventeen_Provinces\n\"Seventeen Provinces\") of _[Zeeland](/wiki/Zeeland \"Zeeland\")_. It was\nsubsequently anglicised as _New Zealand_ by British naval captain [James\nCook](/wiki/James_Cook \"James Cook\") of [HM Bark\n_Endeavour_](/wiki/HM_Bark_Endeavour \"HM Bark Endeavour\") who\n[visited](/wiki/First_voyage_of_James_Cook \"First voyage of James Cook\") the\nislands more than 100 years after Tasman during 1769–1770. Cook returned to\nNew Zealand on both of his subsequent voyages.\n\nVarious claims have been made that New Zealand was reached by other non-\nPolynesian voyagers before Tasman, but these are not widely accepted. Peter\nTrickett, for example, argues in _[Beyond Capricorn](/wiki/Beyond_Capricorn\n\"Beyond Capricorn\")_ that the Portuguese explorer [Cristóvão de\nMendonça](/wiki/Crist%C3%B3v%C3%A3o_de_Mendon%C3%A7a \"Cristóvão de Mendonça\")\n[reached New Zealand](/wiki/Theory_of_Portuguese_discovery_of_Australia\n\"Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia\") in the 1520s, and the [Tamil\nbell](/wiki/Tamil_bell \"Tamil bell\")[8] discovered by\n[missionary](/wiki/Missionary \"Missionary\") [William\nColenso](/wiki/William_Colenso \"William Colenso\") has given rise to a number\nof theories,[9][10] but historians generally believe the bell 'is not in\nitself proof of early Tamil contact with New Zealand'.[11][12][13]\n\nFrom the 1790s, the waters around New Zealand were visited by British, French\nand American [whaling](/wiki/History_of_whaling \"History of whaling\"),\n[sealing](/wiki/Seal_hunting \"Seal hunting\") and trading ships. Their crews\ntraded European goods, including guns and metal tools, for Māori food, water,\nwood, [flax](/wiki/New_Zealand_flax \"New Zealand flax\") and\n[sex](/wiki/Prostitution \"Prostitution\").[14] Māori were reputed to be\nenthusiastic and canny traders, even though the levels of technology,\ninstitutions and property rights differed greatly from the standards in\nEuropean societies.[15] Although there were some conflicts, such as the\nkilling of French explorer [Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne](/wiki/Marc-\nJoseph_Marion_du_Fresne \"Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne\") in 1772 and the\n[destruction of the _Boyd_](/wiki/Boyd_massacre \"Boyd massacre\") in 1809, most\ncontact between Māori and European was peaceful.\n\n### European\nsettlement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: European settlement\")]\n\nFurther information: [Pākehā settlers](/wiki/P%C4%81keh%C4%81_settlers \"Pākehā\nsettlers\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Mission_House_at_Kerikeri.jpg/220px-\nMission_House_at_Kerikeri.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mission_House_at_Kerikeri.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mission_House_at_Kerikeri.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Mission House](/wiki/Mission_House \"Mission House\") at Kerikeri is New\nZealand's oldest surviving building, having been completed in 1822\n\nEuropean ([Pākehā](/wiki/P%C4%81keh%C4%81 \"Pākehā\")) settlement increased\nthrough the early decades of the 19th century, with numerous trading stations\nestablished, especially in the North Island.\n[Christianity](/wiki/Christianity_in_New_Zealand \"Christianity in New\nZealand\") was introduced to New Zealand in 1814 by [Samuel\nMarsden](/wiki/Samuel_Marsden \"Samuel Marsden\"), who travelled to the [Bay of\nIslands](/wiki/Bay_of_Islands \"Bay of Islands\") where he founded a mission\nstation on behalf of the Church of England's [Church Missionary\nSociety](/wiki/Church_Missionary_Society \"Church Missionary Society\").[16] By\n1840 over 20 stations had been established. From missionaries, the Māori\nlearnt not just about Christianity but also about European farming practices\nand trades, and how to read and write.[17] Beginning in 1820, linguist [Samuel\nLee](/wiki/Samuel_Lee_\\(linguist\\) \"Samuel Lee \\(linguist\\)\") worked with\nMāori chief [Hongi Hika](/wiki/Hongi_Hika \"Hongi Hika\") to transcribe the\n[Māori language](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language \"Māori language\") into written\nform.[16]\n\nThe first full-blooded European infant in the territory, Thomas Holloway King,\nwas born on 21 Feb 1815 at the Oihi Mission Station near Hohi Bay[18] in the\nBay of Islands. [Kerikeri](/wiki/Kerikeri \"Kerikeri\"), founded in 1822, and\n[Bluff](/wiki/Bluff,_New_Zealand \"Bluff, New Zealand\") founded in 1823, both\nclaim to be the oldest European settlements in New Zealand.[19] Many European\nsettlers bought land from Māori, but misunderstanding and different concepts\nof land ownership led to conflict and bitterness.[17] In 1839, the [New\nZealand Company](/wiki/New_Zealand_Company \"New Zealand Company\") announced\nplans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand.[20]\nThis alarmed the missionaries, who called for British control of European\nsettlers in New Zealand.\n\n### Māori\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Māori response\")]\n\nThe effect of contact on Māori varied. In some inland areas life went on more\nor less unchanged, although a European metal tool such as a fish-hook or hand\naxe might be acquired through trade with other tribes. At the other end of the\nscale, tribes that frequently encountered Europeans, such as\n[Ngāpuhi](/wiki/Ng%C4%81puhi \"Ngāpuhi\") in [Northland](/wiki/Northland_Region\n\"Northland Region\"), underwent major changes.[16]\n\nPre-European Māori had no distance weapons except for\n[tao](/wiki/Tao_\\(spear\\) \"Tao \\(spear\\)\") (spears)[21] and the introduction\nof the [musket](/wiki/Musket \"Musket\") had an enormous impact on Māori\nwarfare. Tribes with muskets would attack tribes without them, killing or\nenslaving many.[22] As a result, guns became very valuable and Māori would\ntrade huge quantities of goods for a single musket. From 1805 to 1843 the\n[Musket Wars](/wiki/Musket_Wars \"Musket Wars\") raged until a new balance of\npower was achieved after most tribes had acquired muskets. In 1835, the\npeaceful [Moriori](/wiki/Moriori \"Moriori\") of the [Chatham\nIslands](/wiki/Chatham_Islands \"Chatham Islands\") were attacked, enslaved, and\nnearly exterminated by mainland [Ngāti Mutunga](/wiki/Ng%C4%81ti_Mutunga\n\"Ngāti Mutunga\") and [Ngāti Tama](/wiki/Ng%C4%81ti_Tama \"Ngāti Tama\")\nMāori.[23] In the 1901 census, only 35 Moriori were recorded although the\nnumbers subsequently increased.[24]\n\nAround this time, many Māori converted to Christianity.[16] The reasons for\nthis have been hotly debated, and may include social and cultural disruption\ncaused by the Musket Wars and European contact. Other factors may have been\nthe appeal of a religion that promotes peace and forgiveness, a desire to\nemulate the Europeans and to gain a similar abundance of material goods, and\nthe Māori's [polytheistic](/wiki/Polytheistic \"Polytheistic\") culture that\neasily accepted the new God.\n\n## British\nsovereignty[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: British sovereignty\")]\n\nIn 1788 the [Colony of New South Wales](/wiki/Colony_of_New_South_Wales\n\"Colony of New South Wales\") had been founded. According to the future\nGovernor, Captain [Arthur Phillip](/wiki/Arthur_Phillip \"Arthur Phillip\")'s\namended Commission, dated 25 April 1787 the colony of New South Wales included\n\"all the islands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean within the latitudes of 10°37'S\nand 43°39'S\" which included most of New Zealand except for the southern half\nof the South Island.[25] In 1825 with [Van Diemen's\nLand](/wiki/Van_Diemen%27s_Land \"Van Diemen's Land\") becoming a separate\ncolony, the southern boundary of New South Wales was altered[26] to the\nislands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean with a southern boundary of 39°12'S\nwhich included only the northern half of the North Island. However, these\nboundaries had no real impact as the New South Wales administration had little\ninterest in New Zealand.[27]\n\nNew Zealand was first mentioned in British statute in the [Murders Abroad Act\n1817](/wiki/Murders_Abroad_Act_1817 \"Murders Abroad Act 1817\"). It made it\neasier for a court to punish \"murders or manslaughters committed in places not\nwithin His Majesty's [dominions](/wiki/Dominion \"Dominion\")\",[28] and the\n[Governor of New South Wales](/wiki/Governor_of_New_South_Wales \"Governor of\nNew South Wales\") was given increased legal authority over New Zealand.[29]\nThe jurisdiction of the [Supreme Court of New South\nWales](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_New_South_Wales \"Supreme Court of New South\nWales\") over New Zealand was initiated in the [New South Wales Act\n1823](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Act_1823 \"New South Wales Act 1823\"), and lesser\noffences were included at that time.[30][31] In response to complaints from\nmissionaries, about lawless sailors and adventurers in New Zealand, the\n[British government](/wiki/British_government \"British government\") appointed\n[James Busby](/wiki/James_Busby \"James Busby\") as Official Resident in 1832.\nIn 1834 he encouraged Māori chiefs to assert their sovereignty with the\nsigning of the _[Declaration of\nIndependence](/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_New_Zealand\n\"Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand\")_ in 1835. This was\nacknowledged by King [William IV](/wiki/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom\n\"William IV of the United Kingdom\"). Busby was provided with neither legal\nauthority nor military support and was thus ineffective in controlling the\nEuropean population.\n\n### Treaty of\nWaitangi[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Treaty of Waitangi\")]\n\nMain article: [Treaty of Waitangi](/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi \"Treaty of\nWaitangi\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Treatyofwaitangi.jpg/220px-\nTreatyofwaitangi.jpg)](/wiki/File:Treatyofwaitangi.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Treatyofwaitangi.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOne of the few extant copies of the [Treaty of\nWaitangi](/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi \"Treaty of Waitangi\")\n\nIn 1839, the [New Zealand Company](/wiki/New_Zealand_Company \"New Zealand\nCompany\") announced its plans to establish colonies in New Zealand. This and\nthe increased commercial interests of merchants in Sydney and London spurred\nthe British to take stronger action. Captain [William\nHobson](/wiki/William_Hobson \"William Hobson\") was sent to New Zealand to\npersuade Māori to cede their [sovereignty](/wiki/Sovereignty \"Sovereignty\") to\nthe [British Crown](/wiki/British_Crown \"British Crown\"). In reaction to the\nNew Zealand Company's moves, on 15 June 1839 a new Letters patent was issued\nto expand the territory of New South Wales to include all of New Zealand.\n[Governor of New South Wales](/wiki/Governor_of_New_South_Wales \"Governor of\nNew South Wales\") [George Gipps](/wiki/George_Gipps \"George Gipps\") was\nappointed Governor over New Zealand. This was the first clear expression of\nBritish intent to annexe New Zealand.\n\nOn 6 February 1840, Hobson and about forty Māori chiefs signed the [Treaty of\nWaitangi](/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi \"Treaty of Waitangi\") at\n[Waitangi](/wiki/Waitangi,_Northland \"Waitangi, Northland\") in the [Bay of\nIslands](/wiki/Bay_of_Islands \"Bay of Islands\"). Copies of the Treaty were\nsubsequently taken around the country to be signed by other chiefs. A\nsignificant number refused to sign or were not asked but, in total, more than\nfive hundred Māori eventually signed.\n\nThe Treaty gave Māori sovereignty over their lands and possessions and all of\nthe rights of British citizens. What it gave the British in return depends on\nthe language-version of the Treaty that is referred to. The English version\ncan be said to give the British Crown sovereignty over New Zealand but in the\nMāori version the Crown receives _kawanatanga_ , which, arguably, is a lesser\npower (see [interpretations of the\nTreaty](/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi#Meaning_and_interpretation \"Treaty of\nWaitangi\")). Dispute over the true meaning and the intent of either party\nremains an issue.\n\nBritain was motivated by the desire to forestall other European powers (France\nestablished a very small settlement at [Akaroa](/wiki/Akaroa \"Akaroa\") in the\n[South Island](/wiki/South_Island \"South Island\") later in 1840), to\nfacilitate settlement by British subjects and, possibly, to end the\nlawlessness of European (predominantly British and American) whalers, sealers\nand traders. Officials and missionaries had their own positions and\nreputations to protect.\n\nMāori chiefs were motivated by a desire for protection from foreign powers,\nthe establishment of governorship over European settlers and traders in New\nZealand, and to allow for wider settlement that would increase trade and\nprosperity for Māori.[32]\n\nHobson died in September 1842. [Robert FitzRoy](/wiki/Robert_FitzRoy \"Robert\nFitzRoy\"), the new governor, took some legal steps to recognise Māori\ncustom.[33] However, his successor, [George Grey](/wiki/George_Grey \"George\nGrey\"), promoted rapid [cultural assimilation](/wiki/Cultural_assimilation\n\"Cultural assimilation\") and reduction of the land ownership, influence and\nrights of the Māori. The practical effect of the Treaty was, in the beginning,\nonly gradually felt, especially in predominantly Māori regions.\n\n### The colonisation\nproject[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: The colonisation project\")]\n\nAt first New Zealand was administered from Australia as part of the colony of\nNew South Wales.

His plans for\nsystematic British colonisation focused on a free labour system, in contrast\nto the slavery in the United States and the convict labour in Australia.\nInspired by evangelical Christianity and [abolitionism](/wiki/Abolitionism\n\"Abolitionism\"), Wakefield's essays (1829 to 1849), condemned both slavery and\nindentured and convict labour as immoral, unjust, and inefficient. Instead, he\nproposed a government sponsored system in which the price of farm land was set\nat a high enough level to prevent urban workers from easily purchasing it and\nthus leaving the labour market. His colonisation programmes were over-\nelaborate and operated on a much smaller scale than he hoped for, but his\nideas influenced law and culture, especially his vision for the colony as the\nembodiment of post-Enlightenment ideals, the notion of New Zealand as a model\nsociety, and the sense of fairness in employer-employee relations.[34][35]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/William_Allsworth_-\n_The_emigrants_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-William_Allsworth_-\n_The_emigrants_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)](/wiki/File:William_Allsworth_-\n_The_emigrants_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:William_Allsworth_-_The_emigrants_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nScottish Highland family migrating to New Zealand, 1844\n\nSettlement continued under British plans, inspired by a vision of New Zealand\nas a new land of opportunity; the Pākehā population grew explosively from\nfewer than 1000 in 1831 to 500,000 by 1881. Some 400,000 settlers came from\nBritain, of whom 300,000 stayed permanently. Most were young people and\n250,000 babies were born. The passage of 120,000 was paid by the colonial\ngovernment. After 1880 immigration reduced, and growth was due chiefly to the\nexcess of births over deaths.[36]\n\nIn 1846, the British Parliament drafted eleborate plans for a form of self-\ngovernment for the 13,000 settlers in New Zealand. The new Governor, [George\nGrey](/wiki/George_Grey \"George Grey\"), suspended the plans. He argued that\nthe Pākehā could not be trusted to pass laws that would protect the interests\nof the Māori majority — already there had been Treaty violations – and\npersuaded his political superiors to postpone its introduction for five\nyears.[37]\n\n## Growth, conflict and\ndepression[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Growth, conflict and depression\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Now only the government was allowed to purchase land\nfrom Māori, who received cash. The government bought practically all the\nuseful land, then resold it to the [New Zealand\nCompany](/wiki/New_Zealand_Company \"New Zealand Company\"), which promoted\nimmigration, or leased it for sheep runs. The Company resold the best tracts\nto British settlers; its profits were used to pay the travel of the immigrants\nfrom Britain.[41][42]\n\nBecause of the vast distances involved, the first settlers were self-\nsufficient farmers. By the 1840s, however, large scale sheep stations were\nexporting large quantities of wool to the textile mills of England. Most of\nthe early settlers were brought over by a programme operated by the New\nZealand Company and were located in the central region on either side of Cook\nStrait, and at Wellington, Wanganui, New Plymouth and Nelson. These\nsettlements had access to some of the richest plains in the country and after\nrefrigerated ships appeared in 1882, they developed into closely settled\nregions of small-scale farming. Outside these compact settlements were the\nsheep runs. Pioneer pastoralists, often men with experience as squatters in\nAustralia, leased lands from the government at the annual rate of £5 plus £1\nfor each 1,000 sheep above the first 5,000. The leases were renewed\nautomatically, which gave the wealthy pastoralists a strong landed interest\nand made them a powerful political force. In all between 1856 and 1876, 8.1\nmillion acres were sold for £7.6 million, and 2.2 million acres were given\nfree to soldiers, sailors and settlers.[43] With an economy based on\nagriculture, the landscape was transformed from forest to farmland.\n\nGold discoveries in Otago (1861) and Westland (1865), caused a worldwide gold\nrush that more than doubled the population in a short period, from 71,000 in\n1859 to 164,000 in 1863. The value of trade increased fivefold from £2 million\nto £10 million. As the gold boom ended Premier [Julius\nVogel](/wiki/Julius_Vogel \"Julius Vogel\") borrowed money from British\ninvestors and launched in 1870 an ambitious programme of public works and\ninfrastructure investment, together with a policy of assisted immigration.[44]\nSuccessive governments expanded the program with offices across Britain that\nenticed settlers and gave them and their families one-way tickets.[45]\n\nIn the 1870s, the economy lapsed into a long depression as a result of Vogel's\nborrowing and the associated debt burden (especially on land). Despite a brief\nboom in wheat, prices for farm products sagged. The market for land seized up.\nHard times led to urban unemployment and [sweated labour](/wiki/Sweated_labour\n\"Sweated labour\") (exploitative labour conditions) in industry.[46] The\ncountry lost people through emigration, mostly to Australia.\n\n###\nWomen[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Women\")]\n\nSee also: [Women's suffrage in New\nZealand](/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_New_Zealand \"Women's suffrage in New\nZealand\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Tribute_to_the_Suffragettes%2C_close_up.jpg/220px-\nTribute_to_the_Suffragettes%2C_close_up.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tribute_to_the_Suffragettes,_close_up.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tribute_to_the_Suffragettes,_close_up.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Tribute to the Suffragettes_ memorial in [Christchurch](/wiki/Christchurch\n\"Christchurch\") adjacent to [Our City](/wiki/Our_City,_Christchurch \"Our City,\nChristchurch\").

Prominent feminist writers\nincluded Mary Taylor,[48] [Mary Colclough](/wiki/Mary_Ann_Colclough \"Mary Ann\nColclough\") (pseud. Polly Plum),[49] and Ellen Ellis.[50] The first signs of a\npoliticised collective female identity came in crusades to pass the Contagious\nDiseases Prevention Act.[51][52]\n\nFeminists by the 1880s were using the rhetoric of \"white slavery\" to reveal\nmen's sexual and social oppression of women. By demanding that men take\nresponsibility for the right of women to walk the streets in safety, New\nZealand feminists deployed the rhetoric of white slavery to argue for women's\nsexual and social freedom.[53] Middle class women successfully mobilised to\nstop prostitution, especially during the First World War.[54]\n\nMāori women developed their own form of feminism, derived from [Māori\nnationalism](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_nationalism \"Māori nationalism\") rather than\nEuropean sources.[55][56]\n\nIn 1893 [Elizabeth Yates](/wiki/Elizabeth_Yates_\\(mayor\\) \"Elizabeth Yates\n\\(mayor\\)\") was elected mayor of Onehunga, making her the first woman in the\nBritish Empire to hold the office. She was an able administrator: she cut the\ndebt, reorganised the fire brigade, and improved the roads and sanitation.\nMany men were hostile however, and she was defeated for re-election.[57]\nHutching argues that after 1890 women were increasingly well organised through\nthe National Council of Women, the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU),\nthe Women's International League, and the Housewives Union, and others. By\n1910 they were campaigning for peace, and against compulsory military\ntraining, and conscription. They demanded arbitration and the peaceful\nresolution of international disputes. The women argued that womenhood (thanks\nto motherhood) was the repository of superior moral values and concerns and\nfrom their domestic experience they knew best how to resolve conflicts.[58]\n\n###\nSchools[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Schools\")]\n\nMain article: [History of education in New\nZealand](/wiki/History_of_education_in_New_Zealand \"History of education in\nNew Zealand\")\n\nPrior to 1877 schools were operated by the provincial government, churches, or\nby private subscription. Education was not a requirement and many children did\nnot attend any school, especially farm children whose labour was important to\nthe family economy. The quality of education provided varied substantially\ndepending on the school.

Others prospered – until about 1860\nthe city of [Auckland](/wiki/Auckland \"Auckland\") bought most of its food from\nMāori who grew and sold it themselves. Many _iwi_ owned flour mills, ships and\nother items of European technology, some exported food to Australia for a\nbrief period during the 1850s gold rush. Although race relations were\ngenerally peaceful in this period, there were conflicts over who had ultimate\npower in particular areas – the Governor or the Māori chiefs. One such\nconflict was the Northern or [Flagstaff War](/wiki/Flagstaff_War \"Flagstaff\nWar\") of the 1840s, during which [Kororareka](/wiki/Kororareka \"Kororareka\")\nwas sacked.\n\nAs the Pākehā population grew, pressure grew on Māori to sell more land. Land\nis not only an economic resource, but also one basis of Māori identity and a\nconnection with their ancestor's bones. Land was used communally, but under\nthe mana of chiefs. In Māori culture there was no such idea as selling land\nuntil the arrival of Europeans. The means of acquiring land was to defeat\nanother hapu or iwi in battle and seize their land. Te Rauparaha seized the\nland of many lower North Island and upper South Island iwi during the musket\nwars. Land was usually not given up without discussion and consultation. When\nan iwi was divided over the question of selling this could lead to great\ndifficulties as at Waitara.\n\nPākehā had little understanding of all that and accused Māori of holding onto\nland they did not use efficiently. Competition for land was one important\ncause of the [New Zealand Wars](/wiki/New_Zealand_Wars \"New Zealand Wars\") of\nthe 1860s and 1870s, in which the [Taranaki](/wiki/Taranaki \"Taranaki\") and\n[Waikato](/wiki/Waikato \"Waikato\") regions were invaded by colonial troops and\nMāori of these regions had some of their land taken from them. The wars and\nconfiscation left bitterness that remains to this day. After the conclusion of\nthe Land Wars some iwi, especially in the Waikato, such as Ngati Haua sold\nland freely. However, only the chiefs and their whanau benefited from this\nincome. The 2013 Ngati Haua treaty settlement recognised that many Ngati Haua\nhad not received any benefit from the large payments in the 1870s hence the\ngovernment was paying compensation.\n\nSome iwi sided with the government and, later, fought with the government.\nThey were motivated partly by the thought that an alliance with the government\nwould benefit them, and partly by old feuds with the iwi they fought against.\nOne result of their co-operation strategy was the establishment of the four\n[Māori electorates](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_electorates \"Māori electorates\") in the\nHouse of Representatives, in 1867.\n\nAfter the wars, some Māori began a strategy of [passive\nresistance](/wiki/Passive_resistance \"Passive resistance\"), most famously at\n[Parihaka](/wiki/Parihaka \"Parihaka\") in Taranaki. Most, such as NgaPuhi and\nArawa continued co-operating with Pākehā. For example, tourism ventures were\nestablished by [Te Arawa](/wiki/Te_Arawa \"Te Arawa\") around\n[Rotorua](/wiki/Rotorua \"Rotorua\"). Resisting and co-operating iwi both found\nthat Pākehā desire for land remained. In the last decades of the century, most\niwi lost substantial amounts of land through the activities of the [Native\nLand Court](/wiki/Native_Land_Court \"Native Land Court\"). This was set up to\ngive Māori land European-style titles and to establish exactly who owned it.\nDue to its Eurocentric rules, the high fees, its location remote from the\nlands in question, and unfair practices by some Pākehā land agents, its main\neffect was to allow Māori to sell their land without restraint from other\ntribal members.\n\nThe combination of war, confiscations, disease,[64] assimilation and\nintermarriage,[65] land loss leading to poor housing and alcohol abuse, and\ngeneral disillusionment, caused a fall in the Māori population from around\n86,000 in 1769 to around 70,000 in 1840 and around 48,000 by 1874, hitting a\nlow point of 42,000 in 1896.[66] Subsequently, their numbers began to recover.\n\n### South Island\npredominance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: South Island predominance\")]\n\nSee also: [South Island nationalism](/wiki/South_Island_nationalism \"South\nIsland nationalism\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/NZ_Religious_denominations_by_TA_2013.svg/250px-\nNZ_Religious_denominations_by_TA_2013.svg.png)](/wiki/File:NZ_Religious_denominations_by_TA_2013.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NZ_Religious_denominations_by_TA_2013.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe settlement of English in the North Island and northern South Island and\nScottish in the Deep South is reflected in the dominance of\n[Anglicanism](/wiki/Anglicanism \"Anglicanism\") and\n[Presbyterianism](/wiki/Presbyterianism \"Presbyterianism\") in the respective\nregions.\n\nWhile the North Island was convulsed by the Land Wars, the South Island, with\nits lower Māori population, was generally peaceful.

The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New\nZealand never had an aristocracy but it did have wealthy landowners who\nlargely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change\nthat by a policy it called \"populism.\" [Richard Seddon](/wiki/Richard_Seddon\n\"Richard Seddon\") had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: \"It is the rich\nand the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and\nlabouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New\nZealand.\"[70] The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small land-\nowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals.\n\nTo obtain land for farmers the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased\n3.1 million acres of Māori land. The government also purchased 1.3 million\nacres from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small\nfarmers. The Advances to Settlers Act of 1894 provided low-interest mortgages,\nwhile the Agriculture Department disseminated information on the best farming\nmethods.[71][72]\n\nThe 1909 Native Land Act allowed the Māori to sell land to private buyers.\nMāori still owned five million acres by 1920; they leased three million acres\nand used one million acres for themselves. The Liberals proclaimed success in\nforging an egalitarian, antimonopoly land policy. The policy built up support\nfor the Liberal party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903 the Liberals\nwere so dominant that there was no longer an organised opposition in\nParliament.[73][74]\n\n### The state steps\nin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: The state steps in\")]\n\nThe Liberal government laid the foundations of the later comprehensive welfare\nstate: introducing [old age pensions](/wiki/Old_age_pensions \"Old age\npensions\"); maximum hour regulations; pioneering minimum wage laws;[75] and\ndeveloping [a system for settling industrial\ndisputes](/wiki/Industrial_Conciliation_and_Arbitration_Act_1894 \"Industrial\nConciliation and Arbitration Act 1894\"), which was accepted by both employers\nand trade unions.[76] In 1893 it [extended voting rights to\nwomen](/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_New_Zealand \"Women's suffrage in New\nZealand\"), making New Zealand the first country in the world to enact\n[universal female suffrage](/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage \"Women's suffrage\").[77]\n\nNew Zealand gained international attention for its reforms, especially how the\nstate regulated labour relations.[78] The impact was especially strong on the\nreform movement in the United States.[79]\n\nColeman argues that the Liberals in 1891 lacked a clear-cut ideology to guide\nthem. Instead they approached the nation's problems pragmatically, keeping in\nmind the constraints imposed by democratic public opinion. To deal with the\nissue of land distribution, they worked out innovative solutions to access,\ntenure, and a graduated tax on unimproved values.[80]\n\n### Economic\ndevelopments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Economic developments\")]\n\nDuring the 1880s, New Zealand's economy grew from one based on wool and local\ntrade to the export of wool, cheese, butter and frozen beef and mutton to\nBritain. The change was enabled by the invention of refrigerated steamships in\n1882 and a result of the large market demands overseas. In order to increase\nproduction, alongside a more intensive use of factor inputs a transformation\nof production techniques was necessary. The required capital came mainly from\noutside of New Zealand.[81] Refrigerated shipping remained the basis of [New\nZealand's economy](/wiki/Economy_of_New_Zealand \"Economy of New Zealand\")\nuntil the 1970s. New Zealand's highly productive agriculture gave it probably\nthe world's highest standard of living, with fewer at the rich and poor ends\nof the scale.[82]\n\nDuring this era (c. 1880 – c. 1914) the banking system was weak and there was\nlittle foreign investment, so businessmen had to build up their own capital.\nHistorians have debated whether the \"long depression\" of the late 19th century\nstifled investment, but the New Zealanders found a way around adverse\nconditions. Hunter has studied the experiences of 133 entrepreneurs who\nstarted commercial enterprises between 1880 and 1910. The successful strategy\nwas to deploy capital economising techniques, and reinvesting profits rather\nthan borrowing. The result was slow but stable growth that avoided bubbles and\nled to long-lived family owned firms.[83][84]\n\n### Dominion\nstatus[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Dominion status\")]\n\nMain articles: [Dominion of New Zealand](/wiki/Dominion_of_New_Zealand\n\"Dominion of New Zealand\") and [Independence of New\nZealand](/wiki/Independence_of_New_Zealand \"Independence of New Zealand\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Australian_ogre_1900.jpg/220px-\nAustralian_ogre_1900.jpg)](/wiki/File:Australian_ogre_1900.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Australian_ogre_1900.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Zealandia](/wiki/Zealandia_\\(personification\\) \"Zealandia\n\\(personification\\)\") rejecting [Australian\nConstitution](/wiki/Australian_Constitution \"Australian Constitution\") in 1900\n\nNew Zealand initially expressed interest in joining the proposed\n[Federation](/wiki/Federation_of_Australia \"Federation of Australia\") of the\nAustralian colonies, attending the 1891 National Australia Convention in\nSydney. Interest in the proposed Australian Federation faded and New Zealand\ndecided against joining the [Commonwealth of\nAustralia](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia \"Commonwealth of Australia\") in\n1901.[85] New Zealand instead changed from being a colony to a separate\n\"Dominion\" in 1907, equal in status to Australia and Canada. Dominion status\nwas a public mark of the self-governance that had evolved over half a century\nthrough responsible government.[86] Just under one million people lived in New\nZealand in 1907 and cities such as Auckland and Wellington were growing\nrapidly.[87]\n\n### Temperance and\nprohibition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Temperance and prohibition\")]\n\nFurther information: [Temperance movement in New\nZealand](/wiki/Temperance_movement_in_New_Zealand \"Temperance movement in New\nZealand\")\n\nIn New Zealand, [prohibition](/wiki/Prohibition \"Prohibition\") was a\nmoralistic reform movement begun in the mid-1880s by the Protestant\nevangelical and Nonconformist churches and the [Woman's Christian Temperance\nUnion](/wiki/Woman%27s_Christian_Temperance_Union \"Woman's Christian\nTemperance Union\") and after 1890 by the [Prohibition\nLeague](/w/index.php?title=Prohibition_League&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Prohibition League \\(page does not exist\\)\").[88] It never achieved its goal\nof national prohibition. It was a middle-class movement which accepted the\nexisting economic and social order; the effort to legislate morality assumed\nthat individual redemption was all that was needed to carry the colony forward\nfrom a pioneering society to a more mature one. However, both the Church of\nEngland and the largely Irish Catholic Church rejected prohibition as an\nintrusion of government into the church's domain, while the growing labour\nmovement saw capitalism rather than alcohol as the enemy. Reformers hoped that\nthe women's vote, in which New Zealand was a pioneer, would swing the balance,\nbut the women were not as well organised as in other countries. Prohibition\nhad a majority in a national referendum in 1911, but needed a 60% majority to\npass.[89] The movement kept trying in the 1920s, losing three more referenda\nby close votes; it managed to keep in place a 6 pm closing hour for pubs and\nSunday closing (leading to the so-called [six o'clock\nswill](/wiki/Six_o%27clock_swill \"Six o'clock swill\")[90]).

New Zealand depended on Britain's Royal Navy for its military\nsecurity during the 1920s and 1930s. Officials in Wellington trusted\nConservative Party governments in London, but not Labour. When the British\nLabour Party took power in 1924 and 1929, the New Zealand government felt\nthreatened by Labour's foreign policy because of its reliance upon the League\nof Nations. The League was distrusted and Wellington did not expect to see the\ncoming of a peaceful world order under League auspices. What had been the\nEmpire's most loyal dominion became a dissenter as it opposed efforts the\nfirst and second British Labour governments to trust the League's framework of\narbitration and collective security agreements.[97]\n\nThe governments of the Reform and United parties between 1912 and 1935\nfollowed a \"realistic\" foreign policy. They made national security a high\npriority, were sceptical of international institutions, and showed no interest\non the questions of self-determination, democracy, and human rights. However\nthe opposition Labour Party was more idealistic and proposed a liberal\ninternationalist outlook on international affairs.[98]\n\nThe Labour Party emerged as a force in 1919 with a\n[socialist](/wiki/Socialism_in_New_Zealand \"Socialism in New Zealand\")\nplatform. It won about 25% of the vote. However its appeals to working class\nsolidarity were not effective because a large fraction of the working class\nvoted for conservative candidates of the Liberal and Reform parties. (They\nmerged in 1936 to form the [New Zealand National\nParty](/wiki/New_Zealand_National_Party \"New Zealand National Party\").) As a\nconsequence the Labour party was able to jettison its support for socialism in\n1927 (a policy made official in 1951), as it expanded its reach into middle\nclass constituencies. The result was a jump in strength to 35% in 1931, 47% in\n1935, and peaking at 56% in 1938.[99] From 1935 the [First Labour\nGovernment](/wiki/First_Labour_Government_of_New_Zealand \"First Labour\nGovernment of New Zealand\") showed a limited degree of idealism in foreign\npolicy, for example opposing the appeasement of Germany and Japan.[98]\n\n### Great\nDepression[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Great Depression\")]\n\nLike most other countries, New Zealand was hard hit by the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\") of the 1930s, which\naffected the country via its international trade, with farming export drops\nthen going on to affect the money supply and in turn consumption, investment\nand imports. The country was most affected around 1930–1932, when average farm\nincomes for a short time dipped below zero, and the unemployment rates peaked.\nThough actual unemployment numbers were not officially counted, the country\nwas affected especially strongly in the North Island.[100]\n\nUnlike later years, there were no public benefit ('dole') payments – the\nunemployed were given 'relief work', much of which was however not very\nproductive, partly because the size of the problem was unprecedented. Women\nalso increasingly registered as unemployed, while Māori received government\nhelp through other channels such as the land development schemes organised by\n[Āpirana Ngata](/wiki/%C4%80pirana_Ngata \"Āpirana Ngata\"). In 1933, 8.5% of\nthe unemployed were organised in work camps, while the rest received work\nclose to their homes. Typical occupations in relief work were road work\n(undertaken by 45% of all part-time and 19% of all full-time relief workers in\n1934, with park improvement works (17%) and farm work (31%) being the other\ntwo most common types of work for part-time and full-time relief workers\nrespectively).[100]\n\n### Building the welfare\nstate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Building the welfare state\")]\n\nFurther information: [Welfare in New Zealand](/wiki/Welfare_in_New_Zealand\n\"Welfare in New Zealand\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Labour_Cabinet%2C_1935.jpg/220px-\nLabour_Cabinet%2C_1935.jpg)](/wiki/File:Labour_Cabinet,_1935.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Labour_Cabinet,_1935.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [1935 Labour Cabinet](/wiki/First_Labour_Government_of_New_Zealand \"First\nLabour Government of New Zealand\").

The poster reads: \"When war broke out\n... industries were unprepared for munitions production. To-day New Zealand is\nnot only manufacturing many kinds of munitions for her own defence but is\nmaking a valuable contribution to the defence of the other areas in the\nPacific...\"\n\nNew Zealand, with a population of 1.7 million, including 99,000 Māori, was\nhighly mobilised during the war.[103] The Labour party was in power and\npromoted unionisation and the welfare state. Agriculture expanded, sending\nrecord supplies of meat, butter and wool to Britain. When American forces\narrived, they were fed as well.\n\nThe nation spent £574 million on the war, of which 43% came from taxes, 41%\nfrom loans and 16% from American [Lend Lease](/wiki/Lend_Lease \"Lend Lease\").\nIt was an era of prosperity as the national income soared from £158 million in\n1937 to £292 million in 1944. Rationing and price controls kept inflation to\nonly 14% during 1939–45.[104]\n\nOver £50 million was spent on defence works and military accommodation and\nhospitals, including 292 mi (470 km) of roads.[105]\n\nMontgomerie shows that the war dramatically increased the roles of women,\nespecially married women, in the labour force. Most of them took traditional\nfemale jobs. Some replaced men but the changes here were temporary and\nreversed in 1945. After the war, women left traditional male occupations and\nmany women gave up paid employment to return home. There was no radical change\nin gender roles but the war intensified occupational trends under way since\nthe 1920s.[106][107]\n\n## The later 20th\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: The later 20th century\")]\n\n### National in\npower[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: National in power\")]\n\nLabour remained in power after the Second World War and in 1945, Labour Prime\nMinister [Peter Fraser](/wiki/Peter_Fraser_\\(New_Zealand_politician\\) \"Peter\nFraser \\(New Zealand politician\\)\") played an important role in the\nestablishment of the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\"),\nof which New Zealand was [a founding\nmember](/wiki/New_Zealand_and_the_United_Nations \"New Zealand and the United\nNations\").[108] However, domestically Labour had lost the reforming zeal of\nthe 1930s and its electoral support ebbed after the war. After Labour lost\npower in 1949, the conservative National Party began an almost continuous\nthirty-year stint in government, interrupted by single-term Labour governments\nin 1957 to 60 and 1972 to 75. National Prime Minister [Sidney\nHolland](/wiki/Sidney_Holland \"Sidney Holland\") called a snap election as a\nresult of the [1951 waterfront\ndispute](/wiki/1951_New_Zealand_waterfront_dispute \"1951 New Zealand\nwaterfront dispute\"), an incident that reinforced National's dominance and\nseverely weakened the union movement.[109]\n\nCooperation with the United States set a direction of policy which resulted in\nthe [ANZUS](/wiki/ANZUS \"ANZUS\") Treaty between New Zealand, America and\nAustralia in 1951, as well as participation in the [Korean\nWar](/wiki/New_Zealand_in_the_Korean_War \"New Zealand in the Korean\nWar\").[110]\n\n### The British\nconnection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: The British connection\")]\n\nFedorowich and Bridge argue that the demands of the Second World War produced\nlong-term consequences for New Zealand's relationship with the government in\nLondon. The key component was the office of the [high\ncommissioner](/wiki/High_commissioner \"High commissioner\"). By 1950 it was the\nmain line of communications between the British and New Zealand\ngovernments.[111]\n\n1950s New Zealand culture was deeply British and conservative, with the\nconcept of \"fairness\" holding a central role.[112] New immigrants, still\nmainly British, flooded in while New Zealand remained prosperous by exporting\nfarm products to Britain. In 1953 New Zealanders took pride that a countryman,\n[Edmund Hillary](/wiki/Edmund_Hillary \"Edmund Hillary\"), gave [Queen Elizabeth\nII](/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II \"Queen Elizabeth II\") a [coronation\ngift](/wiki/Coronation_of_Elizabeth_II \"Coronation of Elizabeth II\") by\nreaching the summit of Mount Everest.[113]\n\nFrom the 1890s, the economy had been based almost entirely on the export of\nfrozen meat and dairy products to Britain, and in 1961, the share of New\nZealand exports going to the United Kingdom was still at slightly over 51%,\nwith approximately 15% more going to other European countries.[114] The 1960s\nwas a decade of rising prosperity for most New Zealanders, but from 1965 there\nwere also protests – in support of women's rights and the nascent ecological\nmovement, and against the [Vietnam War](/wiki/New_Zealand_in_the_Vietnam_War\n\"New Zealand in the Vietnam War\").[115] Irrespective of political\ndevelopments, many New Zealanders still perceived themselves as a distinctive\noutlying branch of the United Kingdom until at least the 1970s. In 1973\nBritain joined the European Community and abrogated its preferential trade\nagreements with New Zealand (see below), forcing New Zealand to not only find\nnew markets, but also re-examine its national identity and place in the\nworld.[116]\n\n### Māori\nurbanisation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Māori urbanisation\")]\n\nMāori always had a high birth rate; that was neutralised by a high death rate\nuntil modern public health measures became effective in the 20th century when\ntuberculosis deaths and infant mortality declined sharply. Life expectancy\ngrew from 49 years in 1926 to 60 years in 1961 and the total numbers grew\nrapidly.[117] Many Māori served in the Second World War and learned how to\ncope in the modern urban world; others moved from their rural homes to the\ncities to take up jobs vacated by Pākehā servicemen.[118] The shift to the\ncities was also caused by their strong birth rates in the early 20th century,\nwith the existing rural farms in Māori ownership having increasing difficulty\nin providing enough jobs.[118] Māori culture had meanwhile undergone a\nrenaissance thanks in part to politician [Āpirana\nNgata](/wiki/%C4%80pirana_Ngata \"Āpirana Ngata\").[119] By the 1980s 80% of the\nMāori population was urban, in contrast to only 20% before the Second World\nWar. The migration led to better pay, higher standards of living and longer\nschooling, but also exposed problems of racism and discrimination. By the late\n1960s a [protest movement](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_protest_movement \"Māori protest\nmovement\") had emerged to combat racism, promote Māori culture and seek\nfulfilment of the Treaty of Waitangi.[120]\n\nUrbanisation proceeded rapidly across the land. In the late 1940s, town\nplanners noted that the country was \"possibly the third most urbanised country\nin the world\",[121] with two-thirds of the population living in cities or\ntowns. There was also increasing concern that this trend was badly managed,\nwith it being noted that there was an \"ill-defined urban pattern that appears\nto have few of the truly desirable urban qualities and yet manifests no\ncompensating rural characteristics.\"[121]\n\n### The Muldoon years,\n1975–1984[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: The Muldoon years, 1975–1984\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/New_Zealand_Cabinet%2C_1981.jpg/250px-\nNew_Zealand_Cabinet%2C_1981.jpg)](/wiki/File:New_Zealand_Cabinet,_1981.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:New_Zealand_Cabinet,_1981.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Elizabeth II](/wiki/Elizabeth_II \"Elizabeth II\") and Muldoon's Cabinet, taken\nduring the Queen's 1981 tour of New Zealand\n\nThe country's economy suffered in the aftermath of the 1973 global energy\ncrisis, the loss of New Zealand's biggest export market upon Britain's entry\nto the [European Economic Community](/wiki/European_Economic_Community\n\"European Economic Community\"), and rampant inflation.[116] [Robert\nMuldoon](/wiki/Robert_Muldoon \"Robert Muldoon\"), Prime Minister from 1975 to\n1984, and his [Third National\nGovernment](/wiki/Third_National_Government_of_New_Zealand \"Third National\nGovernment of New Zealand\") responded to the crises of the 1970s by attempting\nto preserve the New Zealand of the 1950s. He attempted to maintain New\nZealand's \"cradle to the grave\" welfare state, which dated to 1935. His\ngovernment sought to give retirees 80% of the current wage, which would\nrequire large-scale borrowing; critics said it would bankrupt the treasury.\nMuldoon's response to the crisis also involved imposing a total freeze on\nwages, prices, interest rates and dividends across the national economy.[122]\n\nMuldoon's conservatism and antagonistic style exacerbated an atmosphere of\nconflict in New Zealand, most violently expressed during the [1981 Springbok\nTour](/wiki/1981_Springbok_Tour \"1981 Springbok Tour\").[123] In the 1984\nelections Labour promised to calm down the increasing tensions, while making\nno specific promises; it scored a landslide victory.[122]\n\nHowever, Muldoon's government was not entirely backward looking. Some\ninnovations did take place, for example the [Closer Economic\nRelations](/wiki/Closer_Economic_Relations \"Closer Economic Relations\") (CER)\nfree-trade programme with Australia to liberalise trade, starting in 1982. The\naim of total free trade between the two countries was achieved in 1990, five\nyears ahead of schedule.[124]\n\n### The radical 1980s\nreforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: The radical 1980s reforms\")]\n\nIn 1984, the [Fourth Labour\nGovernment](/wiki/Fourth_Labour_Government_of_New_Zealand \"Fourth Labour\nGovernment of New Zealand\"), led by [David Lange](/wiki/David_Lange \"David\nLange\"), was elected amid a [constitutional and economic\ncrisis](/wiki/1984_New_Zealand_constitutional_crisis \"1984 New Zealand\nconstitutional crisis\"). The crisis led the incoming government to review New\nZealand's constitutional structures, which resulted in the [Constitution Act\n1986](/wiki/Constitution_Act_1986 \"Constitution Act 1986\").[125] In power from\n1984 to 1990, the Labour government launched a major policy of restructuring\nthe economy, radically reducing the role of government.[126] A political\nscientist reports:\n\n> \"Between 1984 and 1993, New Zealand underwent radical economic reform,\n> moving from what had probably been the most protected, regulated and state-\n> dominated system of any capitalist democracy to an extreme position at the\n> open, competitive, free-market end of the spectrum.\"[127]\n\nThe economic reforms were led by finance minister [Roger\nDouglas](/wiki/Roger_Douglas \"Roger Douglas\") (1984–1988). Dubbed\n[Rogernomics](/wiki/Rogernomics \"Rogernomics\"), it was a rapid programme of\nderegulation and public-asset sales. Subsidies were phased out to farmers and\nconsumers. High finance was partly deregulated. Restrictions on foreign\nexchange were relaxed and the dollar was allowed to float and seek its natural\nlevel on the world market. The tax on high incomes was cut in half from 65% to\n33%. The shares exchange entered a bubble, [which then\nburst](/wiki/Black_Monday_\\(1987\\) \"Black Monday \\(1987\\)\"). Shares had a\ntotal value of $50 billion in 1987 and only $15 billion in 1991; at one point\nthe crash was \"the worst in world.\"[128] Overall the economic growth fell from\n2% a year to 1%.[129] Douglas's reforms resembled the contemporaneous policies\nof [Margaret Thatcher](/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher \"Margaret Thatcher\") in Britain\nand [Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\") in the United\nStates.[130]\n\nStrong criticism of Rogernomics came from [the left](/wiki/Left-wing_politics\n\"Left-wing politics\"), especially from Labour's traditional trade union\nsupport-base; Lange broke with Douglas's policies in 1987; both men were\nforced out and Labour was in confusion.[131]\n\nIn keeping with the mood of the 1980s[132] the government sponsored liberal\npolicies and initiatives in a number of social areas; this included\n[Homosexual Law Reform](/wiki/Homosexual_Law_Reform_Act_1986 \"Homosexual Law\nReform Act 1986\"),[133] the introduction of '[no-fault divorce](/wiki/No-\nfault_divorce \"No-fault divorce\")', reduction in the [gender pay\ngap](/wiki/Gender_pay_gap_in_New_Zealand \"Gender pay gap in New Zealand\")[132]\nand the drafting of a [Bill of\nRights](/wiki/New_Zealand_Bill_of_Rights_Act_1990 \"New Zealand Bill of Rights\nAct 1990\").[134] Immigration policy was liberalised, allowing an influx of\nimmigrants from Asia; previously most immigrants to New Zealand had been\nEuropean and especially British.[132]\n\nThe Fourth Labour Government also revolutionised New Zealand's foreign policy,\nmaking the country a [nuclear-free zone](/wiki/New_Zealand_nuclear-free_zone\n\"New Zealand nuclear-free zone\") and effectively leaving the ANZUS\nalliance.[135] The French intelligence service's [sinking of the _Rainbow\nWarror_](/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior \"Sinking of the Rainbow\nWarrior\"), and the diplomatic ramifications following the incident, did much\nto promote the anti-nuclear stance as an important symbol of New Zealand's\n[national identity](/wiki/National_identity \"National identity\").[136][137]\n\n### Continuing reform under\nNational[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Continuing reform under National\")]\n\nVoters unhappy with the rapid speed and far-reaching extent of reforms elected\na [National government](/wiki/Fourth_National_Government_of_New_Zealand\n\"Fourth National Government of New Zealand\") in 1990, led by [Jim\nBolger](/wiki/Jim_Bolger \"Jim Bolger\"). However the new government continued\nthe economic reforms of the previous Labour government, in what was known as\n[Ruthanasia](/wiki/Ruthanasia \"Ruthanasia\").[138] Unhappy with what seemed to\nbe a pattern of governments failing to reflect the mood of the electorate, New\nZealanders in 1992 and 1993 voted to [change the electoral\nsystem](/wiki/Electoral_reform_in_New_Zealand \"Electoral reform in New\nZealand\") to [mixed-member proportional](/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional\n\"Mixed-member proportional\") (MMP), a form of [proportional\nrepresentation](/wiki/Proportional_representation \"Proportional\nrepresentation\").[139] New Zealand's [first MMP\nelection](/wiki/New_Zealand_general_election,_1996 \"New Zealand general\nelection, 1996\") was held in 1996. Following the election National was\nreturned to power in coalition with the [New Zealand\nFirst](/wiki/New_Zealand_First \"New Zealand First\") Party.[140]\n\nWith the end of the Cold War in 1991, the nation's foreign policy turned\nincreasingly to issues of its nuclear-free status and other military issues;\nits adjustment to neoliberalism in international trade relations; and its\ninvolvement in humanitarian, environmental, and other matters of international\ndiplomacy.[141][142]\n\n## 21st\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: 21st century\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Helen_Clark_and_John_Key-3%2C_UNDP.jpg/220px-\nHelen_Clark_and_John_Key-3%2C_UNDP.jpg)](/wiki/File:Helen_Clark_and_John_Key-3,_UNDP.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Helen_Clark_and_John_Key-3,_UNDP.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPrime Ministers [John Key](/wiki/John_Key \"John Key\") and [Helen\nClark](/wiki/Helen_Clark \"Helen Clark\")\n\nThe [Fifth Labour Government](/wiki/Fifth_Labour_Government_of_New_Zealand\n\"Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand\") led by [Helen\nClark](/wiki/Helen_Clark \"Helen Clark\") was elected in\n[1999](/wiki/New_Zealand_general_election,_1999 \"New Zealand general election,\n1999\").[143] In power for nine years, it maintained most of the previous\ngovernments' economic reforms – restricting government intervention in the\neconomy much more so than previous governments – while putting more of an\nemphasis on social policy and outcomes. For example, employment law was\nmodified to give more protection to workers,[144] and the [student loan\nsystem](/wiki/Student_loans_in_New_Zealand \"Student loans in New Zealand\") was\nchanged to eliminate interest payments for New Zealand resident students and\ngraduates.[145]\n\nNew Zealand retains strong but informal links to Britain, with many young New\nZealanders travelling to Britain for their \"OE\" ([overseas\nexperience](/wiki/Overseas_experience \"Overseas experience\"))[146] due to\nfavourable working visa arrangements with Britain. Despite New Zealand's\nimmigration liberalisation in the 1980s, Britons are still the largest group\nof migrants to New Zealand, due in part to recent immigration law changes\nwhich privilege fluent speakers of English. One constitutional link to Britain\nremains – New Zealand's head of State, the [Queen in Right of New\nZealand](/wiki/Monarchy_in_New_Zealand \"Monarchy in New Zealand\"), is a\nBritish resident. However, British imperial honours were discontinued in 1996,\nthe Governor-General has taken a more active role in representing New Zealand\noverseas, and appeals from the [Court of\nAppeal](/wiki/New_Zealand_Court_of_Appeal \"New Zealand Court of Appeal\") to\nthe [Judicial Committee of the Privy\nCouncil](/wiki/Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council \"Judicial Committee of\nthe Privy Council\") were replaced by a local [Supreme Court of New\nZealand](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_New_Zealand \"Supreme Court of New Zealand\") in\n2003. There is public debate about whether New Zealand should [became a\nrepublic](/wiki/Republicanism_in_New_Zealand \"Republicanism in New Zealand\"),\nand public sentiment is divided on the issue.[147]\n\nForeign policy has been essentially independent since the mid-1980s. Under\nPrime Minister Clark, foreign policy reflected the priorities of liberal\ninternationalism. She stressed the promotion of democracy and human rights;\nthe strengthening of the role of the United Nations; the advancement of anti-\nmilitarism and disarmament; and the encouragement of free trade.[148] She sent\ntroops to the [War in\nAfghanistan](/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_\\(2001%E2%80%93present\\) \"War in\nAfghanistan \\(2001–present\\)\"), but did not contribute combat troops to the\n[Iraq War](/wiki/Iraq_War \"Iraq War\") although some medical and engineering\nunits were sent.[149]\n\n[John Key](/wiki/John_Key \"John Key\") led the National Party to victory in the\n[November 2008](/wiki/New_Zealand_general_election,_2008 \"New Zealand general\nelection, 2008\").[150] Key became Prime Minister of the [Fifth National\nGovernment](/wiki/Fifth_National_Government_of_New_Zealand \"Fifth National\nGovernment of New Zealand\") which entered government at the beginning of the\n[late-2000s recession](/wiki/Great_Recession \"Great Recession\").
