There did\nexist a previous version created by Rear Admiral George Balch, a veteran of\nthe Civil War, who later become auditor of the New York Board of Education.\nBalch's pledge, which existed contemporaneously with the Bellamy version until\nthe 1923 National Flag Conference, read:\n\n> We give our heads and hearts to God and our country; one country, one\n> language, one flag![3]\n\nBalch was a proponent of teaching children, especially those of immigrants,\nloyalty to the United States, even going so far as to write a book on the\nsubject and work with both the government and private organizations to\ndistribute flags to every classroom and school.[3][13] Balch's pledge, which\npredates Bellamy's by 5 years and was embraced by many schools, by the\nDaughters of the American Revolution until the 1910s, and by the Grand Army of\nthe Republic until the 1923 National Flag Conference, is often overlooked when\ndiscussing the history of the Pledge.[14] Bellamy, however, did not approve of\nthe pledge as Balch had written it, referring to the text as \"too juvenile and\nlacking in dignity.\"[15] The Bellamy \"Pledge of Allegiance\" was first\npublished in the September 8 issue of the popular children's magazine _[The\nYouth's Companion](/wiki/The_Youth%27s_Companion \"The Youth's Companion\")_ as\npart of the National Public-School Celebration of [Columbus\nDay](/wiki/Columbus_Day \"Columbus Day\"), a celebration of the 400th\nanniversary of [Christopher Columbus](/wiki/Christopher_Columbus \"Christopher\nColumbus\")'s arrival in the Americas. The event was conceived and promoted by\nJames B. Upham, a marketer for the magazine, as a campaign to instill the idea\nof American [nationalism](/wiki/Nationalism \"Nationalism\") in students and to\nsell flags to public schools.[16] According to author Margarette S. Miller,\nthis campaign was in line both with Upham's patriotic vision as well as with\nhis commercial interest. According to Miller, Upham \"would often say to his\nwife: 'Mary, if I can instill into the minds of our American youth a love for\ntheir country and the principles on which it was founded, and create in them\nan ambition to carry on with the ideals which the early founders wrote into\nThe Constitution, I shall not have lived in vain.'\"[17]\n\nBellamy's original Pledge read:\n\n> I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one\n> nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.[1][18]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/PledgeOfAllegiance1899.jpg/220px-\nPledgeOfAllegiance1899.jpg)](/wiki/File:PledgeOfAllegiance1899.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PledgeOfAllegiance1899.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStudents reciting a pledge on [Flag Day](/wiki/Flag_Day_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Flag Day \\(United States\\)\") in 1899\n\nThe Pledge was supposed to be quick and to the point. Bellamy designed it to\nbe recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered\nusing the words _equality_ and _fraternity_[16] but decided against it,\nknowing that the state superintendents of education on his committee were\nagainst equality for women and African Americans.[19]\n\nFrancis Bellamy and Upham had lined up the [National Education\nAssociation](/wiki/National_Education_Association \"National Education\nAssociation\") to support the _Youth 's Companion_ as a sponsor of the Columbus\nDay observance and the use in that observance of the American flag. By June\n29, 1892, Bellamy and Upham had arranged for Congress and [President Benjamin\nHarrison](/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison \"Benjamin Harrison\") to announce a\nproclamation making the public school flag ceremony the center of the Columbus\nDay celebrations. This arrangement was formalized when Harrison issued\nPresidential Proclamation 335. Subsequently, the Pledge was first used in\npublic schools on October 12, 1892, during Columbus Day observances organized\nto coincide with the opening of the [World's Columbian\nExposition](/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition \"World's Columbian\nExposition\") (the Chicago World's Fair), [Illinois](/wiki/Illinois\n\"Illinois\").[20]\n\n### Bellamy's account\n\nIn his recollection of the creation of the Pledge Francis Bellamy said, \"At\nthe beginning of the nineties patriotism and national feeling was (sic) at a\nlow ebb. The patriotic ardor of the [Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War\n\"American Civil War\") was an old story ... The time was ripe for a reawakening\nof simple Americanism and the leaders in the new movement rightly felt that\npatriotic education should begin in the public schools.\"[15] James Upham \"felt\nthat a flag should be on every schoolhouse,\"[15] so his publication \"fostered\na plan of selling flags to schools through the children themselves at cost,\nwhich was so successful that 25,000 schools acquired flags in the first year\n(1892-93).[15]\n\nAs the World's Columbian Exposition was set to celebrate the 400th anniversary\nthe arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas, Upham sought to link the\npublication's flag drive to the event, \"so that every school in the land ...\nwould have a flag raising, under the most impressive conditions.\"[15] Bellamy\nwas placed in charge of this operation and was soon lobbying \"not only the\nsuperintendents of education in all the States, but [he] also worked with\ngovernors, Congressmen, and even the President of the United States.\"[15] The\npublication's efforts paid off when [Benjamin\nHarrison](/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison \"Benjamin Harrison\") declared Wednesday\nOctober 12, 1892, to be Columbus Day for which _[The Youth's\nCompanion](/wiki/The_Youth%27s_Companion \"The Youth's Companion\")_ made \"an\nofficial program for universal use in all the schools.\"[15] Bellamy recalled\nthat the event \"had to be more than a list of exercises. The ritual must be\nprepared with simplicity and dignity.\"[15]\n\nEdna Dean Proctor wrote an ode for the event, and \"There was also an oration\nsuitable for declamation.\"[15] Bellamy held that \"Of course, the nub of the\nprogram was to be the raising of the flag, with a salute to the flag recited\nby the pupils in unison.\"[15] He found \"There was not a satisfactory enough\nform for this salute. The Balch salute, which ran, \"I give my heart and my\nhand to my country, one country, one language, one flag,\" seemed to him too\njuvenile and lacking in dignity.\"[15] After working on the idea with Upham,\nBellamy concluded, \"It was my thought that a vow of loyalty or allegiance to\nthe flag should be the dominant idea. I especially stressed the word\n'allegiance'. ... Beginning with the new word allegiance, I first decided that\n'pledge' was a better school word than 'vow' or 'swear'; and that the first\nperson singular should be used, and that 'my' flag was preferable to\n'the.'\"[15] Bellamy considered the words \"country, nation, or Republic,\"\nchoosing the last as \"it distinguished the form of government chosen by the\nfounding fathers and established by the Revolution. The true reason for\nallegiance to the flag is the Republic for which it stands.\"[15] Bellamy then\nreflected on the sayings of Revolutionary and Civil War figures, and concluded\n\"all that pictured struggle reduced itself to three words, one Nation\nindivisible.\"[15]\n\nBellamy considered the slogan of the [French\nRevolution](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French Revolution\"), _[Liberté, égalité,\nfraternité](/wiki/Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9 \"Liberté,\négalité, fraternité\")_ (\"liberty, equality, fraternity\"), but held that\n\"fraternity was too remote of realization, and … [that] equality was a dubious\nword.\"[15] Concluding \"Liberty and justice were surely basic, were\nundebatable, and were all that any one Nation could handle. If they were\nexercised for all. they involved the spirit of equality and fraternity.\"[15]\n\nAfter being reviewed by Upham and other members of _The Youth 's Companion_,\nthe Pledge was approved and put in the official Columbus Day program. Bellamy\nnoted that, \"In later years the words 'to my flag' were changed to 'to the\nflag of the United States of America' because of the large number of foreign\nchildren in the schools.\"[15] Bellamy disliked the change, as \"it did injure\nthe rhythmic balance of the original composition.\"[15]\n\n## Changes\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_Memorial_Plaque_and_Pledge_to_the_Flag_-\n_Lansing%2C_MI.jpg/220px-\nGrand_Army_of_the_Republic_Memorial_Plaque_and_Pledge_to_the_Flag_-\n_Lansing%2C_MI.jpg)](/wiki/File:Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_Memorial_Plaque_and_Pledge_to_the_Flag_-\n_Lansing,_MI.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_Memorial_Plaque_and_Pledge_to_the_Flag_-\n_Lansing,_MI.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA plaque in Lansing, MI, dated 1918, listing the Balch Pledge, which was used\nparallel to the Bellamy Pledge until the National Flag Conference in 1923.\n\nIn 1906, The Daughters of the American Revolution's magazine, _The American\nMonthly_ , listed the \"formula of allegiance\" as being the Balch Pledge of\nAllegiance, which reads:[14]\n\n> I pledge allegiance to my flag, and the republic for which it stands. I\n> pledge my head and my heart to God and my country. One country, one language\n> and one flag.\n>\n> — Balch Pledge of Allegiance\n\nIn subsequent publications of the Daughters of the American Revolution, such\nas in 1915's \"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Continental Congress of the\nDaughters of the American Revolution\" and 1916's annual \"National Report,\" the\nBalch Pledge, listed as official in 1906, is now categorized as \"Old Pledge\"\nwith Bellamy's version under the heading \"New Pledge.\"[21][22] However, the\n\"Old Pledge\" continued to be used by other organizations until the National\nFlag Conference established uniform flag procedures in 1923.\n\nIn 1923, the National Flag Conference called for the words \"my Flag\" to be\nchanged to \"the Flag of the United States,\" so that new immigrants would not\nconfuse loyalties between their birth countries and the US. The words \"of\nAmerica\" were added a year later. Congress officially recognized the Pledge\nfor the first time, in the following form, on June 22, 1942:[23]\n\n> I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the\n> Republic for which it stands, one Nation indivisible, with liberty and\n> justice for all.\n>\n> — 1942 Pledge of Allegiance\n\n### Addition of \"under God\"\n\n\"Under God\" redirects here. For the book, see [Under God\n(book)](/wiki/Under_God_\\(book\\) \"Under God \\(book\\)\").\n\nLouis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was the first to suggest the\naddition of \"under God\" to the pledge. The National Society of the [Daughters\nof the American Revolution](/wiki/Daughters_of_the_American_Revolution\n\"Daughters of the American Revolution\") gave him an Award of Merit as the\noriginator of this idea.[24][25] He spent his adult life in the Chicago area\nand was chaplain of the Illinois Society of the [Sons of the American\nRevolution](/wiki/Sons_of_the_American_Revolution \"Sons of the American\nRevolution\"). At a meeting on February 12, 1948,[24] he led the society in\nreciting the pledge with the two words \"under God\" added. He said that the\nwords came from Lincoln's [Gettysburg Address](/wiki/Gettysburg_Address\n\"Gettysburg Address\"). Although not all manuscript versions of the [Gettysburg\nAddress contain the words \"under\nGod\"](/wiki/Gettysburg_address#Usage_of_.22under_God.22 \"Gettysburg address\"),\nall the reporters' transcripts of the speech as delivered do, as perhaps\nLincoln may have deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when\nhe said \"that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom.\"\nBowman repeated his revised version of the Pledge at other meetings.[24]\n\nIn 1951, the [Knights of Columbus](/wiki/Knights_of_Columbus \"Knights of\nColumbus\"), the world's largest [Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church \"Roman\nCatholic Church\") [fraternal service\norganization](/wiki/Fraternal_and_service_organizations \"Fraternal and service\norganizations\"), also began including the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of\nAllegiance.[26] In New York City, on April 30, 1951, the board of directors of\nthe Knights of Columbus adopted a resolution to amend the text of their Pledge\nof Allegiance at the opening of each of the meetings of the 800 Fourth Degree\nAssemblies of the Knights of Columbus by addition of the words \"under God\"\nafter the words \"one nation.\" Over the next two years, the idea spread\nthroughout Knights of Columbus organizations nationwide. On August 21, 1952,\nthe Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus at its annual meeting adopted a\nresolution urging that the change be made universal, and copies of this\nresolution were sent to the President, the Vice President (as Presiding\nOfficer of the Senate), and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The\nNational Fraternal Congress meeting in Boston on September 24, 1952, adopted a\nsimilar resolution upon the recommendation of its president, Supreme Knight\n[Luke E. Hart](/wiki/Luke_E._Hart \"Luke E. Hart\"). Several State Fraternal\nCongresses acted likewise almost immediately thereafter. This campaign led to\nseveral official attempts to prompt Congress to adopt the Knights of Columbus\npolicy for the entire nation. These attempts were eventually a success.[27]\n\nIn 1952, Holger Christian Langmack suggested in a letter to President Truman\nadding \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. Langmack was a Danish\nphilosopher and educator who came to the US in 1911. He was one of the\noriginators of the [National Prayer Breakfast](/wiki/National_Prayer_Breakfast\n\"National Prayer Breakfast\") and a religious leader in Washington, D.C. Truman\nmet with Langmack and with several others to discuss the addition.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] At the\nsuggestion of a correspondent, Representative [Louis C.\nRabaut](/wiki/Louis_C._Rabaut \"Louis C.

The final successful push came from [George MacPherson\nDocherty](/wiki/George_MacPherson_Docherty \"George MacPherson Docherty\"). Some\nAmerican presidents honored Lincoln's birthday by attending services at the\nchurch Lincoln attended, [New York Avenue Presbyterian\nChurch](/wiki/New_York_Avenue_Presbyterian_Church \"New York Avenue\nPresbyterian Church\") by sitting in Lincoln's pew on the Sunday nearest\nFebruary 12. On February 7, 1954, with President Eisenhower sitting in\nLincoln's pew, the church's pastor, [George MacPherson\nDocherty](/wiki/George_MacPherson_Docherty \"George MacPherson Docherty\"),\ndelivered a sermon based on the Gettysburg Address entitled \"A New Birth of\nFreedom.\" He argued that the nation's might lay not in arms but rather in its\nspirit and higher purpose. He noted that the Pledge's sentiments could be\nthose of any nation: \"There was something missing in the pledge, and that\nwhich was missing was the characteristic and definitive factor in the American\nway of life.\" He cited Lincoln's words \"under God\" as defining words that set\nthe US apart from other nations.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nPresident [Eisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\") had\nbeen baptized a [Presbyterian](/wiki/Presbyterian \"Presbyterian\") very\nrecently, just a year before. He responded enthusiastically to Docherty in a\nconversation following the service. Eisenhower acted on his suggestion the\nnext day and on February 8, 1954, Rep. [Charles Oakman](/wiki/Charles_Oakman\n\"Charles Oakman\") ([R](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican\nParty \\(United States\\)\")-[Mich.](/wiki/Michigan \"Michigan\")), introduced a\nbill to that effect. [Congress](/wiki/83rd_United_States_Congress \"83rd United\nStates Congress\") passed the necessary legislation and Eisenhower signed the\nbill into law on [Flag Day](/wiki/Flag_Day_\\(United_States\\) \"Flag Day\n\\(United States\\)\"), June 14, 1954.[28] Eisenhower said:[29]\n\n> From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily\n> proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural school house, the\n> dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty.... In this way we\n> are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage\n> and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual\n> weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource, in peace\n> or in war.\n>\n> — Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nThe phrase \"under God\" was incorporated into the Pledge of Allegiance on June\n14, 1954, by a [Joint Resolution](/wiki/Joint_Resolution \"Joint Resolution\")\nof Congress amending § 4 of the [Flag Code](/wiki/United_States_Flag_Code\n\"United States Flag Code\") enacted in 1942.[28]\n\nOn October 6, 1954, the National Executive Committee of the American Legion\nadopted a resolution, first approved by the Illinois American Legion\nConvention in August 1954, which formally recognized the Knights of Columbus\nfor having initiated and brought forward the amendment to the Pledge of\nAllegiance.[27]\n\nEven though the movement behind inserting \"under God\" into the pledge might\nhave been initiated by a private religious fraternity and even though\nreferences to God appear in previous versions of the pledge, author Kevin\nKruse asserts that this movement was an effort by corporate America to instill\nin the minds of the people that capitalism and free enterprise were heavenly\nblessed. Kruse acknowledges the insertion of the phrase was influenced by the\npush-back against atheistic communism during the Cold War, but argues the\nlonger arc of history shows the conflation of Christianity and capitalism as a\nchallenge to the [New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\") played the larger\nrole.[30]\n\n## Salute\n\nSwearing of the Pledge is accompanied by a [salute](/wiki/Salute \"Salute\"). An\nearly version of the salute, adopted in 1887, known as the Balch Salute, which\naccompanied the Balch pledge, instructed students to stand with their right\nhand outstretched toward the flag, the fingers of which are then brought to\nthe forehead, followed by being placed flat over the heart, and finally\nfalling to the side.[3]\n\nIn 1892, Francis Bellamy created what was known as the [Bellamy\nsalute](/wiki/Bellamy_salute \"Bellamy salute\"). It started with the hand\noutstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended with the palm up. Because\nof the similarity between the Bellamy salute and the [Nazi\nsalute](/wiki/Nazi_salute \"Nazi salute\"), which was adopted in Germany later,\nthe US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute\nto be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the [national\nanthem](/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner \"The Star-Spangled Banner\") in the US\nwould be the salute to replace the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy\nsalute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag Code\nlanguage first passed into law on June 22, 1942.[31] Attached to bills passed\nin Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1)of title 36, United\nStates Code), language was included which authorized all active duty military\npersonnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute\nduring the raising and lowering of the flag, when the colors are presented,\nand during the National Anthem.[32]\n\n## Music\n\n[![Musical setting by Irving\nCaesar](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Pledge-of-\nAllegiance-to-the-Flag-by-Irving-Caesar.pdf/page1-220px-Pledge-of-Allegiance-\nto-the-Flag-by-Irving-Caesar.pdf.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pledge-of-Allegiance-to-the-\nFlag-by-Irving-Caesar.pdf)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pledge-of-Allegiance-to-the-Flag-by-Irving-Caesar.pdf \"Enlarge\")\n\nMusical setting by Irving Caesar\n\nA musical setting for \"The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag\" was created by\nIrving Caesar, at the suggestion of Congressman Louis C. Rabaut whose House\nResolution 243 to add the phrase \"under God\" was signed into law on Flag Day,\nJune 14, 1954.[33]\n\nThe composer, Irving Caesar, wrote and published over 700 songs in his\nlifetime. Dedicated to social issues, he donated all rights of the musical\nsetting to the U.S. government, so that anyone can perform the piece without\nowing royalties.[34][35]\n\nIt was sung for the first time on the floor of the House of Representatives on\nFlag Day, June 14, 1955 by the official Air Force choral group the \"Singing\nSergeants\". A July 29, 1955 House and Senate resolution authorized the U.S.\nGovernment Printing Office to print and distribute the song sheet together\nwith a history of the pledge.[36]\n\nOther musical versions of the Pledge have since been copyrighted, including by\nBeck (2003), Lovrekovich (2002 and 2001), Roton (1991), Fijol (1986), and\nGirardet (1983).[37]\n\n## Controversy\n\nMain article: [Criticism of the Pledge of\nAllegiance](/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Pledge_of_Allegiance \"Criticism of the\nPledge of Allegiance\")\n\nIn 1940, the [Supreme Court](/wiki/Supreme_Court_\\(United_States\\) \"Supreme\nCourt \\(United States\\)\"), in _[Minersville School District v.\nGobitis](/wiki/Minersville_School_District_v._Gobitis \"Minersville School\nDistrict v.

Jackson](/wiki/Robert_H._Jackson \"Robert H.\nJackson\"), writing for the 6 to 3 majority, went beyond simply ruling in the\nprecise matter presented by the case to say that public school students are\nnot required to say the Pledge on narrow grounds, and asserted that such\nideological dogmata are antithetical to the principles of the country,\nconcluding with:[38]\n\n> If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that\n> no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in\n> politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force\n> citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any\n> circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.\n>\n> — Robert H. Jackson, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\n\nIn a later case, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals held that students are also\nnot required to stand for the Pledge.[39]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/JapaneseAmericansChildrenPledgingAllegiance1942-2.jpg/220px-\nJapaneseAmericansChildrenPledgingAllegiance1942-2.jpg)](/wiki/File:JapaneseAmericansChildrenPledgingAllegiance1942-2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:JapaneseAmericansChildrenPledgingAllegiance1942-2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFirst graders of Japanese ancestry pledging allegiance to the American flag\n(1942, photo by [Dorothea Lange](/wiki/Dorothea_Lange \"Dorothea Lange\")).\n\nRequiring or promoting of the Pledge on the part of the government has\ncontinued to draw criticism and legal challenges on several grounds.\n\nOne objection is that a democratic republic built on freedom of\n[dissent](/wiki/Dissent \"Dissent\") should not require its citizens to pledge\nallegiance to it, and that the [First Amendment to the United States\nConstitution](/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") protects the right to refrain\nfrom speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech in the\ncontext of the ritual of pledging allegiance.[40][39] Another objection is\nthat the people who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small\nchildren in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely\nunderstand the Pledge they are making.[41] Another criticism is that a\ngovernment requiring or promoting this phrase violates protections against the\n[establishment of religion](/wiki/Establishment_of_religion \"Establishment of\nreligion\") guaranteed in the [Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment](/wiki/Establishment_Clause_of_the_First_Amendment \"Establishment\nClause of the First Amendment\").[42]\n\nIn 2004, linguist [Geoffrey Nunberg](/wiki/Geoffrey_Nunberg \"Geoffrey\nNunberg\") said the original supporters of the addition thought that they were\nsimply quoting Lincoln's [Gettysburg Address](/wiki/Gettysburg_Address\n\"Gettysburg Address\"), but to Lincoln and his contemporaries, \"under God\"\nmeant \"God willing\", so they would have found its use in the Pledge of\nAllegiance grammatically incorrect and semantically odd.[43][44]\n\n### Legal challenges\n\nProminent legal challenges were brought in the 1930s and 1940s by [Jehovah's\nWitnesses](/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses \"Jehovah's Witnesses\"), a denomination\nwhose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power other than God, and who\nobjected to policies in public schools requiring students to swear an oath to\nthe flag.[45] They said requiring the pledge violated their [freedom of\nreligion](/wiki/Freedom_of_religion \"Freedom of religion\") guaranteed by the\n[Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment](/wiki/Free_Exercise_Clause_of_the_First_Amendment \"Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment\"). The first case was in 1935, when two\nchildren, [Lillian and William\nGobitas](/wiki/Minersville_School_District_v._Gobitis \"Minersville School\nDistrict v. Gobitis\"), ages ten and twelve, were expelled from the\nMinersville, Pennsylvania, public schools that year for failing to salute the\nflag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.[46][47]\n\nIn a 2002 case brought by atheist [Michael Newdow](/wiki/Michael_Newdow\n\"Michael Newdow\"), whose daughter was being taught the Pledge in school, the\n[Ninth Circuit Court of\nAppeals](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit \"United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\") ruled the phrase \"under God\"\nan unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism when the Pledge was promoted in\npublic school. In 2004, the [Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/Supreme_Court_\\(United_States\\) \"Supreme Court \\(United\nStates\\)\") heard _[Elk Grove Unified School District v.\nNewdow](/wiki/Elk_Grove_Unified_School_District_v._Newdow \"Elk Grove Unified\nSchool District v. Newdow\")_ , an appeal of the ruling, and rejected Newdow's\nclaim on the grounds that he was not the custodial parent, and therefore\nlacked standing, thus avoiding ruling on the merits of whether the phrase was\nconstitutional in a school-sponsored recitation. On January 3, 2005, a new\nsuit was filed in the [U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of\nCalifornia](/wiki/U.S._District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_California\n\"U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California\") on behalf of\nthree unnamed families. On September 14, 2005, District Court Judge [Lawrence\nKarlton](/wiki/Lawrence_Karlton \"Lawrence Karlton\") ruled in their favor.\nCiting the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,\nJudge Karlton issued an Order stating that, upon proper motion, he would\nenjoin the school district defendants from continuing their practices of\nleading children in pledging allegiance to \"one Nation under God.\"[48]\n\nA 2005 [Bill](/wiki/Bill_\\(proposed_law\\) \"Bill \\(proposed law\\)\"), H.R. 2389,\nto prohibit the Supreme Court's and most federal courts from considering any\nlegal challenges to the government's requiring or promoting of the Pledge of\nAllegiance, died in the Senate after having passed in the House. This action\nis viewed[_[by\nwhom?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] in general as [court\nstripping](/wiki/Jurisdiction_stripping \"Jurisdiction stripping\") by Congress\nof the constitutional power of the Judiciary. Even if a similar bill is\nenacted, its practical effect may not be\nclear:[_[opinion](/wiki/Wikipedia:ASF#A_simple_formulation \"Wikipedia:ASF\")_]\nproponents of the bill have said that it is a valid exercise of Congress's\npower to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts under [Article\nIII](/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article Three of\nthe United States Constitution\"), Section 2 of the Constitution, but opponents\nsay Congress does not have the authority to prevent the Supreme Court from\nhearing claims based on the Bill of Rights, since amendments postdate the\noriginal text of the Constitution and may thus implicitly limit the scope of\nArticle III, Section 2. Judges and legal analysts have said that if Congress\ncan remove from the judicial branch the ability to determine if legislation is\nconstitutional, the US [separation of powers](/wiki/Separation_of_powers\n\"Separation of powers\") would be disturbed, or rendered non-functional.[49]\n\nMark J. Pelavin, former Associate Director of the [Religious Action Center of\nReform Judaism](/wiki/Religious_Action_Center_of_Reform_Judaism \"Religious\nAction Center of Reform Judaism\"), said of court stripping in regard to the\nPledge of Allegiance that:[50][51]\n\n> Today's House adoption of the so-called \"[Pledge Protection\n> Act](/wiki/Pledge_Protection_Act \"Pledge Protection Act\")\" is a shameful\n> effort to strip our federal courts of their ability to uphold the rights of\n> all Americans. By removing the jurisdiction of federal courts, including the\n> Supreme Court, from cases involving the Pledge, this legislation sets a\n> dangerous precedent: threatening religious liberty, compromising the vital\n> system of checks and balances upon which our government was founded, and\n> granting Congress the authority to strip the courts' jurisdiction on any\n> issue it wishes. Today, the issue was the Pledge of Allegiance, but tomorrow\n> it could be reproductive rights, civil rights, or any other fundamental\n> concern.\n>\n> — Mark J. Pelavin, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism\n\nIn 2006, in the Florida case _Frazier v. Alexandre_ , a federal district court\nin Florida ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite\nthe Pledge of Allegiance violates the\n[First](/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") and [Fourteenth\nAmendments](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_\\(United_States\\) \"Fourteenth Amendment\n\\(United States\\)\") of the U.S. Constitution.[52] As a result of that\ndecision, a Florida school district was ordered to pay $32,500 to a student\nwho chose not to say the pledge and was ridiculed and called \"unpatriotic\" by\na teacher.[53]\n\nIn 2009, a [Montgomery County, Maryland](/wiki/Montgomery_County,_Maryland\n\"Montgomery County, Maryland\"), teacher berated and had school police remove a\n13-year-old girl who refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom.\nThe student's mother, assisted by the American Civil Liberties Union of\nMaryland, sought and received an apology from the teacher, as state law and\nthe school's student handbook both prohibit students from being forced to\nrecite the Pledge.[54]\n\nOn March 11, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the words \"under\nGod\" in the Pledge of Allegiance in the case of _Newdow v. Rio Linda Union\nSchool District_.[55][56] In a 2–1 decision, the appellate court ruled that\nthe words were of a \"ceremonial and patriotic nature\" and did not constitute\nan establishment of religion.[55] Judge [Stephen\nReinhardt](/wiki/Stephen_Reinhardt \"Stephen Reinhardt\") dissented, writing\nthat \"the state-directed, teacher-led daily recitation in public schools of\nthe amended 'under God' version of the Pledge of Allegiance... violates the\nEstablishment Clause of the Constitution.\"[57]\n\nOn November 12, 2010, in a unanimous decision, the [United States Court of\nAppeals for the First\nCircuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_First_Circuit \"United\nStates Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\") in Boston affirmed a ruling by\na New Hampshire lower federal court which found that the pledge's reference to\nGod does not violate non-pledging students' rights if student participation in\nthe pledge is voluntary.[58][59] A [United States Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court \"United States Supreme Court\") appeal\nof this decision was denied on June 13, 2011.[60][61]\n\nIn September 2013, a case was brought before the [Massachusetts Supreme\nJudicial Court](/wiki/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court \"Massachusetts\nSupreme Judicial Court\"), arguing that the pledge violates the Equal Rights\nAmendment of the [Constitution of\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Constitution_of_Massachusetts \"Constitution of\nMassachusetts\").[62] In May 2014, Massachusetts' highest court ruled that the\npledge does not discriminate against atheists, saying that the words \"under\nGod\" represent a patriotic, not a religious, exercise.[63]\n\nIn February 2015 [New Jersey Superior Court](/wiki/New_Jersey_Superior_Court\n\"New Jersey Superior Court\") Judge [David F. Bauman](/wiki/David_F._Bauman\n\"David F. Bauman\") dismissed a lawsuit, ruling that \"… the Pledge of\nAllegiance does not violate the rights of those who don't believe in God and\ndoes not have to be removed from the patriotic message.\"[64] The case against\nthe [Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District](/wiki/Matawan-\nAberdeen_Regional_School_District \"Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District\")\nhad been brought by a student of the district and the [American Humanist\nAssociation](/wiki/American_Humanist_Association \"American Humanist\nAssociation\") that argued that the phrase \"under God\"in the pledge created a\nclimate of discrimination because it promoted religion, making non-believers\n\"second-class citizens.\"In a twenty-one page decision, Bauman wrote, \"Under\n[the association members'] reasoning, the very constitution under which [the\nmembers] seek redress for perceived atheistic marginalization could itself be\ndeemed unconstitutional, an absurd proposition which [association members] do\nnot and cannot advance here.\"[64] Bauman said the student could skip the\npledge, but upheld a New Jersey law that says pupils must recite the pledge\nunless they have \"conscientious scruples\"that do not allow it.[65][66] He\nnoted, \"As a matter of historical tradition, the words 'under God' can no more\nbe expunged from the national consciousness than the words '[In God We\nTrust](/wiki/In_God_We_Trust \"In God We Trust\")' from every coin in the land,\nthan the words 'so help me God' from every presidential oath since 1789, or\nthan the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative\nbusiness since 1787.”\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Australian citizenship affirmation](/wiki/Australian_citizenship_affirmation \"Australian citizenship affirmation\"), a similar concept\n  * [Ceremonial deism](/wiki/Ceremonial_deism \"Ceremonial deism\")\n  * [Flag Salute](/wiki/Flag_Salute \"Flag Salute\")\n  * [Loyalty oaths in the United States](/wiki/Loyalty_oaths_in_the_United_States \"Loyalty oaths in the United States\")\n  * [Youth's Companion Building](/wiki/Youth%27s_Companion_Building \"Youth's Companion Building\"), where the Pledge of Allegiance was written and published\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ [\"The Pledge of Allegiance\"](http://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm). _Historic Documents_.
