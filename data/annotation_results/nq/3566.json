Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed\n**The Bean** because of its shape. Made up of 168 [stainless\nsteel](/wiki/Stainless_steel \"Stainless steel\") plates welded together, its\nhighly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet\n(10 by 20 by 13 m), and weighs 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons).\n\nKapoor's design was inspired by liquid [mercury](/wiki/Mercury_\\(element\\)\n\"Mercury \\(element\\)\") and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the\ncity's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's\n12-foot (3.7 m) high arch. On the underside is the \"omphalos\" (Greek for\n\"navel\"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The\nsculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic\n[themes](/wiki/Theme_\\(visual_arts\\) \"Theme \\(visual arts\\)\"), and it is\npopular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective\nproperties.\n\nThe sculpture was the result of a design competition. After Kapoor's design\nwas chosen, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's\nconstruction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the\nsculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Various experts were consulted, some of\nwhom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible\nmethod was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. It\nwas unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening\ncelebration in 2004, before being concealed again while it was completed.\n_Cloud Gate_ was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and has since gained\nconsiderable popularity, both domestically and internationally.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Design\n  * 2 Construction and maintenance\n  * 3 Reception\n  * 4 Artistic themes\n    * 4.1 Relevant Kapoor themes\n    * 4.2 _Cloud Gate_ themes\n  * 5 In popular culture\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n    * 7.1 Notes\n    * 7.2 Bibliography\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Design[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Design\")]\n\n![Rectangular map of a park about 1.5 times as wide as it is tall.

American artist\n[Jeff Koons](/wiki/Jeff_Koons \"Jeff Koons\") submitted a proposal to erect a\npermanent 150-foot (46 m) sculpture of a [playground\nslide](/wiki/Playground_slide \"Playground slide\");[3][4] his glass and steel\ndesign featured an [observation deck](/wiki/Observation_deck \"Observation\ndeck\") 90 feet (27 m) above the ground that was accessible via an elevator.[5]\nThe committee chose the second design by internationally acclaimed artist\n[Anish Kapoor](/wiki/Anish_Kapoor \"Anish Kapoor\"). Measuring 33 by 66 by 42\nfeet (10 by 20 by 13 m) and weighing 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons), the\nproposal featured a seamless, [stainless steel](/wiki/Stainless_steel\n\"Stainless steel\") surface inspired by liquid\n[mercury](/wiki/Mercury_\\(element\\) \"Mercury \\(element\\)\").[6] This mirror-\nlike surface would reflect the Chicago skyline, but its elliptical shape would\ndistort and twist the reflected image.[7] As visitors walk around the\nstructure, its surface acts like a [fun-house mirror](/wiki/Curved_mirror\n\"Curved mirror\") as it distorts their reflections.[8]\n\n[![Headshot of an Indian man with gray hair and black\nshirt](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Kapoor_cropped.jpg/220px-\nKapoor_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kapoor_cropped.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kapoor_cropped.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Anish Kapoor](/wiki/Anish_Kapoor \"Anish Kapoor\")'s design proposal was chosen\nover works by thirty different artists.\n\nIn the underside of the sculpture is the [omphalos](/wiki/Omphalos\n\"Omphalos\"), an indentation whose mirrored surface provides multiple\nreflections of any subject situated beneath it.[9] The apex of the omphalos is\n27 feet (8.2 m) above the ground. The concave underside allows visitors to\nwalk underneath to see the omphalos, and through its arch to the other side so\nthat they view the entire structure.[10] During the grand opening week in July\n2004, press reports described the omphalos as the \"spoon-like\nunderbelly\".[11][12] The stainless steel sculpture was originally envisioned\nas the centerpiece of the [Lurie Garden](/wiki/Lurie_Garden \"Lurie Garden\") at\nthe southeast corner of the park. However, Park officials believed the piece\nwas too large for the Lurie Garden and decided to locate it at [AT&T\nPlaza](/wiki/AT%26T_Plaza \"AT&T Plaza\"), despite Kapoor's objections.[13]\n[Skyscrapers](/wiki/Skyscraper \"Skyscraper\") to the north along East [Randolph\nStreet](/wiki/Randolph_Street \"Randolph Street\"), including [The\nHeritage](/wiki/The_Heritage_at_Millennium_Park \"The Heritage at Millennium\nPark\"), the [Smurfit-Stone Building](/wiki/Smurfit-Stone_Building \"Smurfit-\nStone Building\"), [Two Prudential Plaza](/wiki/Two_Prudential_Plaza \"Two\nPrudential Plaza\"), [One Prudential Plaza](/wiki/One_Prudential_Plaza \"One\nPrudential Plaza\"), and [Aon Center](/wiki/Aon_Center_\\(Chicago\\) \"Aon Center\n\\(Chicago\\)\") are visible, reflected on both the east and west sides of the\nsculpture.\n\nAlthough Kapoor does not draw with computers, computer modeling was essential\nto the process of analyzing the complex form,[14] which created numerous\nissues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that\nit might retain and conduct heat in a way that would make it too hot to touch\nduring the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the\nwinter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to\nweaken the structure. [Graffiti](/wiki/Graffiti \"Graffiti\"), bird droppings\nand [fingerprints](/wiki/Fingerprint \"Fingerprint\") were also potential\nproblems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface.[4][15] The most\npressing issue was the need to create a single\n[seamless](/wiki/Seam_\\(metallurgy\\) \"Seam \\(metallurgy\\)\") exterior for the\nexternal shell, a feat architect [Norman\nFoster](/wiki/Norman_Foster,_Baron_Foster_of_Thames_Bank \"Norman Foster, Baron\nFoster of Thames Bank\") once believed to be nearly impossible.[15]\n\nWhile the sculpture was being constructed, public and media outlets nicknamed\nit \"The Bean\" because of its shape, a name that Kapoor described as\n\"completely stupid\".[13] Months later, Kapoor officially named the piece\n\"Cloud Gate\".[16] (Kapoor eventually accepted the nickname of \"The Bean\".[17])\nCritical reviews describe the sculpture as a passage between realms.[18]\nThree-quarters of the sculpture's external surface reflects the sky and the\nname refers to it acting as a type of gate that helps bridge the space between\nthe sky and the viewer.[19] The sculpture and plaza are sometimes referred to\njointly as \"_Cloud Gate_ on the AT&T Plaza\".[20] It is Kapoor's first public\noutdoor work in the United States,[20] and is the work by which he is best\nknown in the country according to the _[Financial Times](/wiki/Financial_Times\n\"Financial Times\")_.[21]\n\n## Construction and\nmaintenance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Construction and maintenance\")]\n\n[![A crane lifts a large, oval-shaped ring in front of several large\nbuildings](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Cloud_gate_construction.jpg/220px-\nCloud_gate_construction.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cloud_gate_construction.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cloud_gate_construction.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe first of two internal support rings for the sculpture is erected in\n[Millennium Park](/wiki/Millennium_Park \"Millennium Park\") at [AT&T\nPlaza](/wiki/AT%26T_Plaza \"AT&T Plaza\").\n\nThe British engineering firm [Atelier One](/wiki/Atelier_One \"Atelier One\")\nand freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later went on to form the\nengineering firm Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural\ndesign,[22][23] and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to\n[fabricate](/wiki/Fabrication_\\(metal\\) \"Fabrication \\(metal\\)\") it because of\ntheir ability to produce nearly invisible [welds](/wiki/Welding \"Welding\").[3]\nThe project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A\nhigh-density [polyurethane](/wiki/Polyurethane \"Polyurethane\") foam model was\nselected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure,\nincluding the interior structural components.[24] Initially, PSI planned to\nbuild and assemble the sculpture in [Oakland,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Oakland,_California \"Oakland, California\"), and ship it to\nChicago through the [Panama Canal](/wiki/Panama_Canal \"Panama Canal\") and [St.\nLawrence Seaway](/wiki/St._Lawrence_Seaway \"St. Lawrence Seaway\"). However,\nthis plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so the\ndecision was made to transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble\nthe structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.[3][24][25]\n\nThe sculpture's weight raised concerns. Estimating the thickness of the steel\nneeded to create the sculpture's desired aesthetics before fabrication was\ndifficult.[26] _Cloud Gate_ was originally estimated to weigh 60 short tons\n(54 t; 54 long tons) when completed.[27] However, the final figure was almost\ntwice as heavy at 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons). This extra weight\nrequired engineers to reconsider the sculpture's supporting structures. The\nroof of the [Park Grill](/wiki/Park_Grill \"Park Grill\"), upon which _Cloud\nGate_ sits, had to be built strong enough to bear the weight. The large\nretaining wall separating Chicago's [Metra](/wiki/Metra \"Metra\") train tracks\nfrom the North [Grant Park](/wiki/Grant_Park_\\(Chicago\\) \"Grant Park\n\\(Chicago\\)\") garage supports much of the weight of the sculpture and forms\nthe back side of the restaurant. This wall, along with the rest of the\ngarage's foundation, required additional bracing before the piece was\nerected.[26] _Cloud Gate_ is further [buttressed](/wiki/Buttress \"Buttress\")\nby lateral members underneath the plaza that are anchored to the sculpture's\ninterior structure by [tie rods](/wiki/Tie_rod \"Tie rod\").[24]\n\nInside _Cloud Gate_ 's polished exterior shell are several steel structures\nthat keep the sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two [type 304\nstainless steel](/wiki/Stainless_steel#Stainless_steel_grades \"Stainless\nsteel\") rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction\ncontinued, crisscrossing pipe [trusses](/wiki/Truss \"Truss\") were assembled\nbetween the two rings.[28] The trusses and supporting structures were only\npresent for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner\nbracing.[29] The supporting structural components were designed and\nconstructed to ensure that no specific point was overloaded, and to avoid\nproducing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also\ndesigned to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate.\nAs a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently\nof each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.[24]\n\nWhen _Cloud Gate '_s interior components were completed, construction crews\nprepared to work on the outer shell; this comprises 168 stainless steel\npanels, each 3⁄8 inch (10 mm) thick and weighing 1,000 to 2,000\n[pounds](/wiki/Pound_\\(mass\\) \"Pound \\(mass\\)\") (450 to 910\n[kg](/wiki/Kilogram \"Kilogram\")).[30] They were fabricated using three-\ndimensional modeling software.[24] Computers and robots were essential in the\nbending and shaping of the plates,[25] which was performed by [English\nwheel](/wiki/English_wheel \"English wheel\") and a robotic scanning device.[31]\nMetal stiffeners were welded to each panel's interior face to provide a small\ndegree of rigidity. About a third of the plates, along with the entire\ninterior structure, were fabricated in Oakland.[24] The plates were polished\nto 98 percent of their final state and covered with protective white film\nbefore being sent to Chicago via trucks.[32] Once in Chicago, the plates were\nwelded together on-site, creating 2,442 linear feet (744 m) of welded\nseams.[30] Welders used [keyhole welding machines](/wiki/Laser-hybrid_welding\n\"Laser-hybrid welding\") rather than traditional welding guns.[6] The plates\nwere fabricated so precisely that no on-site cutting or filing was necessary\nwhen lifting and fitting them into position.[30]\n\nWhen construction of the shell began in June 2004, a large tent was erected\naround the piece to shield it from public view.[33] Construction began with\nthe omphalos, where plates were attached to the supporting internal steel\nstructure, from the inside (underside) of the sculpture downward to the\noutermost surfaces.[32] This sequence caused the structure to resemble a large\n[sombrero](/wiki/Sombrero \"Sombrero\") when the bottom was complete.[34]\n\nThe shell of _Cloud Gate_ was fully erected for the grand opening of\nMillennium Park on July 15, 2004, although it was unpolished and thus\nunfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was\ntemporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy\nwith this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished\nstate.[35] The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for\npolishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park\nofficials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected\nin January 2005 as a 24-person crew from [Ironworkers Local\n63](/wiki/International_Association_of_Bridge,_Structural,_Ornamental_and_Reinforcing_Iron_Workers\n\"International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing\nIron Workers\") polished the seams between each plate.[30][36] In order to\ngrind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of\n[scaffolding](/wiki/Scaffolding \"Scaffolding\") were erected around the sides\nof the sculpture, while [climbing ropes](/wiki/Climbing_equipment \"Climbing\nequipment\") and [harnesses](/wiki/Climbing_harness \"Climbing harness\") were\nused to polish harder-to-reach areas.[30] When the upper and side portions of\nthe shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On\nOctober 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final\nsection.[37] Every weld on the _Cloud Gate_ underwent a five-stage process,\nrequired to produce the sculpture's mirror-like finish.[30]\n\nStage | Name | Equipment used | Sandpaper type | Purpose  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n1 | Rough cut | 5-pound (2.3 kg), 4½-inch (110 mm) electric grinder | 40-grit | Removed [welded](/wiki/Welding \"Welding\") seams  \n2 | Initial contour | 15-pound (6.8 kg), 2-inch (51 mm), air-driven [belt sander](/wiki/Belt_sander \"Belt sander\") | 80-grit, 100-grit and 120-grit | Shaped the weld contours  \n3 | Sculpting | air-driven 10-pound (4.5 kg), 1-inch (25 mm) belt sander | 80-grit, 120-grit, 240-grit and 400-grit | Smoothed the weld contours  \n4 | Refining | [double action sander](/wiki/Random_orbital_sander \"Random orbital sander\") | 400-grit, 600-grit and 800-grit | Removed the fine scratches that were left from the sculpting stage  \n5 | Polishing | 10-inch (250 mm) electric buffing wheel | 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of [rouge](/wiki/Iron\\(III\\)_oxide#Polishing \"Iron\\(III\\) oxide\") | Buffed and polished the surface to a mirror-like finish  \n  \nThe sculpture was finally completed on August 28, 2005, and officially\nunveiled on May 15, 2006.[38][39] The cost for the piece was first estimated\nat $6 million; this had escalated to $11.5 million by the time the park opened\nin 2004,[40] with the final figure standing at $23 million in 2006.[4] No\npublic funds were involved; all funding came from donations from individuals\nand corporations.[4]\n\nKapoor's contract states that the constructed piece should be expected to\nsurvive for 1,000 years.[41] The lower 6 feet (1.8 m) of _Cloud Gate_ is wiped\ndown twice a day by hand, while the entire sculpture is cleaned twice a year\nwith 40 U.S. gallons (33 imp gal; 150 L) of liquid detergent. The daily\ncleanings use a [Windex](/wiki/Windex \"Windex\")-like solution, while the semi-\nannual cleanings use [Tide](/wiki/Tide_\\(brand\\) \"Tide \\(brand\\)\").[42] A\nnotable February 2009 rare incident saw two names etched in letters about 1\ninch (25 mm) tall on the northeast side of the curved sculpture. The graffiti\nwas removed by the same firm that did the original polishing.[43]\n\n## Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Reception\")]\n\n[![A large white tent sits on the roof of a cafe building set in front of a\nskyscraper and blue\nsky.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Tented_cloud_gate.jpg/220px-\nTented_cloud_gate.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tented_cloud_gate.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tented_cloud_gate.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA tent was erected to cover _Cloud Gate_ while it was being polished in 2004\nand 2005.\n\n[Chicago Mayor](/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago \"Mayor of Chicago\") [Richard M.\nDaley](/wiki/Richard_M._Daley \"Richard M. Daley\") declared the day of the\nsculpture's dedication, May 15, 2006, to be \"Cloud Gate Day\". Kapoor attended\nthe celebration, while local jazz trumpeter and bandleader [Orbert\nDavis](/wiki/Orbert_Davis \"Orbert Davis\") and the Chicago Jazz Philharmonic\nplayed \"Fanfare for Cloud Gate\", which Davis composed.[44] The public took an\ninstant liking to the sculpture, affectionately referring to it as \"The\nBean\".[45] _Cloud Gate_ has become a popular piece of [public\nart](/wiki/Public_art \"Public art\")[8][46] and is now a fixture on many\nsouvenirs such as postcards, sweatshirts, and posters.[47] The sculpture has\nattracted a large number of locals, tourists, and art aficionados from around\nthe world.[48] The sculpture is now the piece by which Kapoor is most\nidentified in the United States.[49]\n\n_[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\")_ describes the piece as\nan essential photo opportunity, and more of a destination than a work of\nart.[8]_[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_\nwrites that it is both a \"tourist magnet\" and an \"extraordinary art\nobject\",[48][50] while _[USA Today](/wiki/USA_Today \"USA Today\")_ refers to\nthe sculpture as a monumental [abstract](/wiki/Abstract_art \"Abstract art\")\nwork.[51] Chicago art critic [Edward Lifson](/wiki/Edward_Lifson \"Edward\nLifson\") considers _Cloud Gate_ to be among the greatest pieces of public art\nin the world.[44] The [American Welding\nSociety](/wiki/American_Welding_Society \"American Welding Society\") recognized\n_Cloud Gate_ , MTH Industries and PSI with the group's Extraordinary Welding\nAward.[52] _Time_ named Millennium Park one of the ten best architectural\nachievements of 2004, citing _Cloud Gate_ as one of the park's major\nattractions.[53]\n\nWhat I wanted to do in Millennium Park is make something that would engage the\nChicago skyline ... so that one will see the clouds kind of floating in, with\nthose very tall buildings reflected in the work. And then, since it is in the\nform of a gate, the participant, the viewer, will be able to enter into this\nvery deep chamber that does, in a way, the same thing to one's reflection as\nthe exterior of the piece is doing to the reflection of the city around.\n\n—[Anish Kapoor](/wiki/Anish_Kapoor \"Anish Kapoor\")[20]\n\nWhen the park first opened in 2004, [Metra](/wiki/Metra \"Metra\") police\nstopped a [Columbia College Chicago](/wiki/Columbia_College_Chicago \"Columbia\nCollege Chicago\") [journalism](/wiki/Journalism \"Journalism\") student who was\nworking on a photography project in Millennium Park and confiscated his film\nbecause of fears of terrorism.[54] In 2005, the sculpture attracted some\ncontroversy when a professional [photographer](/wiki/Photographer\n\"Photographer\") without a paid permit was denied access to the piece.[55] As\nis the case for all works of art currently covered by United States\n[copyright](/wiki/Copyright \"Copyright\") law, the artist holds the copyright\nfor the sculpture. This allows the public to freely photograph _Cloud Gate_ ,\nbut permission from Kapoor or the City of Chicago (which has licensed the art)\nis required for any commercial reproductions of the photographs. The city\nfirst set a policy of collecting permit fees for photographs. These permits\nwere initially set at $350 per day for professional still photographers,\n$1,200 per day for professional [videographers](/wiki/Videographer\n\"Videographer\") and $50 per hour for wedding photographers. The policy has\nbeen changed so permits are only required for large-scale film, video and\nphotography requiring ten-person crews and equipment.[56]\n\nIn addition to restricting photography of public art, closing a public park\nfor a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all\nof Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both\noccasions, as one of the park's primary attractions, _Cloud Gate_ was the\nfocus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, [Toyota Motor Sales\nUSA](/wiki/Toyota_Motor_Sales_USA \"Toyota Motor Sales USA\") paid $800,000 to\nrent most venues in the park including _Cloud Gate_ on AT&T Plaza from 6 a.m.\nto 11 p.m.[57][58] On August 7, 2006, [Allstate](/wiki/Allstate \"Allstate\")\npaid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the\nvisitation rights to a different set of features and only had exclusive access\nto _Cloud Gate_ after 4 p.m.[59] These corporate closures denied tourists\naccess to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters who walk through the park\nwere forced to take alternative routes. City officials stated that the money\nwould help finance free public programs in Millennium Park.[57]\n\nIn 2015, a sculpture similar to Cloud Gate was reported in\n[Karamay](/wiki/Karamay \"Karamay\"), China at the site of an oil discovery,\nwhich according to Eduardo Peñalver, the Dean of Cornell Law School, \"very\nprobably\" is a copyright infringement against _Cloud Gate_.[60] Though\ndesigned to resemble an oil bubble, Kapoor hoped that legal action would be\ntaken against what he termed a Chinese knockoff.[61] Mayor [Rahm\nEmanuel](/wiki/Rahm_Emanuel \"Rahm Emanuel\") was less concerned and said that\nit was a flattering imitation.[62]\n\n## Artistic themes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Artistic themes\")]\n\n### Relevant Kapoor\nthemes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Relevant Kapoor themes\")]\n\nI hope what I have done is make a serious work, which deals with serious\nquestions about form, public space and an object in space. You can capture the\npopular imagination and hold other points of interest, but that is not what I\nset out to do, although there is inevitably a certain spectacular in an object\nlike this.\n\n—[Anish Kapoor](/wiki/Anish_Kapoor \"Anish Kapoor\")[41]\n\n[Anish Kapoor](/wiki/Anish_Kapoor \"Anish Kapoor\") has a reputation for\ncreating spectacles in urban settings by producing works of extreme size and\nscale.[21] Before creating _Cloud Gate_ , Kapoor had created art that\ndistorted images of the viewer instead of portraying images of its own. In so\ndoing, he acquired experience blurring the boundary between the limit and the\nlimitless.[63] Kapoor drew on past experience to design _Cloud Gate_ , in\nparticular the designing of _[Sky Mirror](/wiki/Sky_Mirror \"Sky Mirror\")_\n(2001), a 20-foot (6.1 m) 10-short-ton (9 t; 9-long-ton) concave stainless\nsteel mirror that also used a theme of distorted perception on a grand\nscale.[63]\n\nKapoor's objects often aim to evoke immateriality and the spiritual, an\noutcome he achieves either by carving dark voids into stone pieces, or more\nrecently, through the sheer shine and reflectivity of his objects.[45] This\nIndian artist's works have no fixed identity, but rather occupy an illusionary\nspace that is consistent with eastern theologies shared by\n[Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism \"Buddhism\"), [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism \"Hinduism\")\nand [Taoism](/wiki/Taoism \"Taoism\"), as well as [Albert\nEinstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein \"Albert Einstein\")'s views of a non-three-\ndimensional world.[18] Kapoor explores the theme of ambiguity with his works\nthat place the viewer in a state of \"in-betweenness\".[64] The artist often\nquestions and plays with such dualities as solidity–emptiness or\nreality–reflection, which in turn allude to such paired opposites as\nflesh–spirit, the here–the beyond, east–west, sky–earth, etc. that create the\nconflict between internal and external, superficial and subterranean, and\nconscious and unconscious.[65] Kapoor also creates a tension between masculine\nand feminine within his art by having concave points of focus that invite the\nentry of visitors and multiplies their images when they are positioned\ncorrectly.[65][66]\n\n### _Cloud Gate_\nthemes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Cloud Gate themes\")]\n\nKapoor often speaks of removing both the signature of the artist from his\nworks as well as any traces of their fabrication, or what he refers to as\n\"traces of the hand\".[18][45] He aspires to make his works look like they have\nindependent realities that he reveals rather than creates.[18] For him,\nremoving all the seams from _Cloud Gate_ was necessary in order to make the\nsculpture seem as though it was \"perfect\" and ready-made. These effects\nincrease the viewer's fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and\nwhere it came from.[46] His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist\nstand in contrast to [Frank Gehry](/wiki/Frank_Gehry \"Frank Gehry\")'s\narchitectural designs in the park, [Jay Pritzker\nPavilion](/wiki/Jay_Pritzker_Pavilion \"Jay Pritzker Pavilion\") and [BP\nPedestrian Bridge](/wiki/BP_Pedestrian_Bridge \"BP Pedestrian Bridge\"), which\ndisplay their seams prominently.[16]\n\n_Cloud Gate_ is described as a transformative, iconic work.[67] It is similar\nto many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses.\nWhile the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground\nmirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this\nvery large object, making it seem light and almost weightless.[8][68] _Cloud\nGate_ is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form\ndynamics.[69] Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through\nintellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and\nnon-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, _Cloud Gate_ limits its\nviewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer\nwho moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension.[64] The\nsculpture is described as a disembodied, luminous form,[64] which is also how\nhis earlier _1000 Names_ (1979–80) was described when it addressed the\nmetaphysical and mystical.[65]\n\nThe viewer physically enters the art when he walks underneath it into its\n\"navel\". The omphalos is a \"warped dimension of fluid space\". In this\ndimension, solid is transformed into fluid in a disorienting multiplicative\nmanner that intensifies the experience. It is emblematic of Kapoor's work to\ndeconstruct empirical space and venture into [manifold](/wiki/Manifold\n\"Manifold\") possibilities of [abstract space](/wiki/Abstract_space \"Abstract\nspace\").[69] The experience is described as a displaced or virtual depth that\nis composed of multiplied surfaces.[70]\n\nAccording to project manager Lou Cerny of MTH Industries, \"When the light is\nright, you can't see where the sculpture ends and the sky begins.\"[71] The\nsculpture challenges perception by distorting and deforming the surrounding\narchitecture.[72] The [skyscrapers](/wiki/Skyscraper \"Skyscraper\") along East\n[Randolph Street](/wiki/Randolph_Street \"Randolph Street\") to the northeast\n([Two Prudential Plaza](/wiki/Two_Prudential_Plaza \"Two Prudential Plaza\"),\nand [Aon Center](/wiki/Aon_Center_\\(Chicago\\) \"Aon Center \\(Chicago\\)\")),\nnorth ([One Prudential Plaza](/wiki/One_Prudential_Plaza \"One Prudential\nPlaza\")) and northwest ([The Heritage](/wiki/The_Heritage_at_Millennium_Park\n\"The Heritage at Millennium Park\"), [Crain Communications\nBuilding](/wiki/Crain_Communications_Building \"Crain Communications\nBuilding\")) are reflected on _Cloud Gate '_s surface when viewed from either\nthe east or the west. The sculpture also warps viewers' perception of time by\nchanging the speed of movements such as the passing of clouds.[72]\n\nAlthough in the conventional sense _Cloud Gate_ is not an opening that leads\nanywhere in the same way that monumental gates do, it frames a view and is\ncelebratory in the way it creates a ceremonial place. The work is credited\nwith achieving a new level or understanding described as a\n[transubstantiation](/wiki/Transubstantiation \"Transubstantiation\") of\nmaterial, reminiscent of that which the artist experienced during a 1979 trip\nto India. Kapoor's _1000 Names_ evolved immediately after this trip; twenty-\nfive years later he created _Cloud Gate_ , an object that emerged from\nmaterial forms to become immaterial.[18]\n\nKapoor often relies on tenets of Hinduism in his art and says that \"The\nexperience of opposites allows for the expression of wholeness.\"[18] Primal\ndualities that are one, such as the [lingam](/wiki/Lingam \"Lingam\") and\n[yoni](/wiki/Yoni \"Yoni\"), are important to Indian culture, and _Cloud Gate_\nrepresents both the male and female in one entity by symbolizing both the\n[vagina](/wiki/Vagina \"Vagina\") and [testicles](/wiki/Testicle\n\"Testicle\").[18] Thus, it represents the tension between the masculine and the\nfeminine.\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: In popular culture\")]\n\nThe sculpture has been used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the\n2006 Hollywood film _[The Break-Up](/wiki/The_Break-Up \"The Break-Up\")_ ,\nwhich had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for\nthe initial filming.[73] It is also prominently featured in the ending scene\nof _[Source Code](/wiki/Source_Code \"Source Code\")_. Director [Duncan\nJones](/wiki/Duncan_Jones \"Duncan Jones\") felt the structure was a metaphor\nfor the movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at the beginning\nand end of the movie.[74] The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic\nsetting for the 2012 film _[The Vow](/wiki/The_Vow_\\(2012_film\\) \"The Vow\n\\(2012 film\\)\")_ when the lead characters share a kiss under it.[75][76] It\nalso appears in the video to\n\"[Homecoming](/wiki/Homecoming_\\(Kanye_West_song\\) \"Homecoming \\(Kanye West\nsong\\)\")\", a song by Chicago native [Kanye West](/wiki/Kanye_West \"Kanye\nWest\"), featuring [Chris Martin](/wiki/Chris_Martin \"Chris Martin\") of the\nband [Coldplay](/wiki/Coldplay \"Coldplay\").[77] The sculpture is also featured\nin the 2008 [mumblecore](/wiki/Mumblecore \"Mumblecore\") film _[Nights and\nWeekends](/wiki/Nights_and_Weekends \"Nights and Weekends\")_. It was also\nfeatured in the Bollywood film _[Dhoom 3](/wiki/Dhoom_3 \"Dhoom 3\")_[78] and\nthe 2014 movie, _[Transformers: Age of\nExtinction](/wiki/Transformers:_Age_of_Extinction \"Transformers: Age of\nExtinction\")_ , the fourth installment in the [_Transformers_\nseries](/wiki/Transformers_\\(film_series\\) \"Transformers \\(film\nseries\\)\").[79] A modified reproduction of _Cloud Gate_ is also included in\n_[Watch Dogs](/wiki/Watch_Dogs \"Watch Dogs\")_ , a video game released in 2014\nthat takes place in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\").[80] Unlike the real\nsculpture, the in-game replica is a curved, white [torus](/wiki/Torus\n\"Torus\").[81] A movement to Windex the Bean was started in 2017, gaining the\nattention of over thirty thousand people on Facebook. The event took place on\nNovember 15th, 2017, because of a consensus that the Bean is dirty and needs\nto be cleaned.[82]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of public art in Chicago](/wiki/List_of_public_art_in_Chicago \"List of public art in Chicago\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n### Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Gate&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Gilfoyle, Timothy J.
