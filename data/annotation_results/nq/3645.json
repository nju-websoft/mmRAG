The novelization of the film expounds on George's history\nof weakness, describing two incidents in which he is unable to stand up for\nhimself. In 1955, in contrast with Marty, George did not have any friends for\nsupport and was targeted not only by Biff and his gang but also other kids in\nschool. He has a penchant for [science fiction](/wiki/Science_fiction \"Science\nfiction\"), and writes some of his own but never allows himself to share them\nwith anyone due to his fear of rejection. In 1955, with Marty's help, he gets\nthe courage to stand up to Biff, knocking him unconscious. As a result, he and\nLorraine fall in love and George becomes popular in school for defeating Biff\nin a fight. In the new future, they are both happily married with George\nworking as a college professor and being a successful writer who orders Biff\naround. In the alternate timeline in _Part II_ , George was murdered by Biff\nin 1973.\n\nGeorge's character was greatly reduced in the sequels, and the role was recast\nto [Jeffrey Weissman](/wiki/Jeffrey_Weissman \"Jeffrey Weissman\").[2] Weissman\nwore [prosthetics](/wiki/Prosthetics \"Prosthetics\") to resemble Glover and\nimitated Glover's rendering of McFly, and his scenes were spliced with shots\nof Glover from _Back to the Future_.[3] The result was so convincing that many\npeople were fooled by it.[3] Glover did not appreciate this, and sued.

Much like his descendants, Seamus is harassed by a member of the\nTannen family, Buford Tannen.\n\nMaggie McFly is played by Lea Thompson, who also plays Marty's mother\nLorraine, even though Maggie is not an ancestor of Lorraine; in a DVD\ncommentary track for [_Part III_](/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_III \"Back to\nthe Future Part III\"), [Bob Gale](/wiki/Bob_Gale \"Bob Gale\") states that the\ncreative team considered it important to include Thompson in the film, and he\nimagines that McFly men are simply \"genetically predisposed\" to be attracted\nto women who look like her.\n\n### Marty Jr. and Marlene\nMcFly[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Back_to_the_Future_characters&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Marty Jr. and Marlene McFly\")]\n\nMarty Jr. and Marlene McFly (both portrayed by Michael J.

Consequently, the opening scene of _[Back to the Future Part\nII](/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II \"Back to the Future Part II\")_ was re-\nshot with Shue taking Wells' place, rather than using the ending of _Back to\nthe Future_.

Only one of their\nreal names is mentioned in the movies – Biff refers to Skinhead as Joey in one\nof the 1955 scenes in _[Back to the Future Part\nII](/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II \"Back to the Future Part II\")_ , while\noutside of the \"Enchantment Under the Sea\" dance.\n\nIn the alternate 1985, the three work in Biff's casino as his bodyguards. Each\ngets his nickname from a distinctive character trait. Match often has a match\nsticking out of his mouth; Skinhead has very short, close-cropped hair; 3-D is\nalways wearing a pair of [anaglyphic 3-D](/wiki/Anaglyph_3D \"Anaglyph 3D\")\nglasses (a reference to the [3-D](/wiki/3-D_film \"3-D film\") movies that were\npopular in the 1950s).\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Back_to_the_Future_characters&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![United States film clapperboard.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/United_States_film_clapperboard.svg/24px-United_States_film_clapperboard.svg.png)](/wiki/File:United_States_film_clapperboard.svg)[Film in the United States portal](/wiki/Portal:Film_in_the_United_States \"Portal:Film in the United States\")\n  * [![Sf-userbox.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Sf-userbox.png/21px-Sf-userbox.png)](/wiki/File:Sf-userbox.png)[Science fiction portal](/wiki/Portal:Science_fiction \"Portal:Science fiction\")\n  * [![Friendly stickman.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Friendly_stickman.svg/24px-Friendly_stickman.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Friendly_stickman.svg)[Fictional characters portal](/wiki/Portal:Fictional_characters \"Portal:Fictional characters\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Back_to_the_Future_characters&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"_Empire 's_ The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\"](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/100-greatest-movie-characters/). _Empire_ Magazine.
