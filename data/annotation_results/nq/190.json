Mike Morris described the name as \"a piss-take\non all the ‘elegant’ groups at the time.\"[5] Later on, Morris proposed the\nname Faith In No Man, but, eventually, the band settled on Bordin's suggestion\nFaith No Man (stylized as Faith.

It was\noriginally designed by Billy Gould as an homage to the [Symbol of\nChaos](/wiki/Symbol_of_Chaos \"Symbol of Chaos\").[6]\n\nThey recorded \"[Quiet in Heaven/Song of\nLiberty](/wiki/Quiet_in_Heaven/Song_of_Liberty \"Quiet in Heaven/Song of\nLiberty\")\", released in 1983. The songs were recorded in [Matt\nWallace](/wiki/Matt_Wallace \"Matt Wallace\")'s parents' garage, where Wallace\nhad set up and been running a recording studio while the band was still\nrecording under the name Sharp Young Men,[7] with Mike Morris, Billy Gould,\nMike Bordin and Wade Worthington. Worthington left shortly thereafter. They\nchanged their name to Faith No Man for the release of the single, which\nfeatured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace's garage,[8] and hired\nRoddy Bottum to replace Worthington. Bottum, Gould and Bordin quit the band\nshortly after and formed Faith No More. They chose the name to accentuate the\nfact that \"The Man\" (Mike Morris) was \"No More\". They didn't have any constant\nguitarists or vocalists until they eventually settled on [Chuck\nMosley](/wiki/Chuck_Mosley \"Chuck Mosley\") in 1983 and later [Jim\nMartin](/wiki/Jim_Martin_\\(musician\\) \"Jim Martin \\(musician\\)\").[9]\n\n### _We Care a Lot_ and _Introduce Yourself_\n(1985–1988)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Faith_No_More&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: We Care a Lot and Introduce Yourself \\(1985–1988\\)\")]\n\nAfter the name change, the band initially started recording _We Care a Lot_\nwithout backing from a [record label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\") and,\nafter pooling their money, recorded five songs. This gained the attention of\nRuth Schwartz, who was then forming the independent label [Mordam\nRecords](/wiki/Mordam_Records \"Mordam Records\"), under which the band, after\ngetting the necessary financial support, finished and released the album.

Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic,\nparticularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him\nallegedly punching Billy Gould on stage,[12] the release party for the album\n_Introduce Yourself_ — during which he fell asleep on stage — and one of\nMosley's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during\nthe European tour.[13][12] Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned\nhome from Europe. Billy Gould reflected \"There was a certain point when I went\nto rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so\nfar off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band.\nI Just said: ‘I’m done – I can’t take this any longer. It’s just so\nridiculous’. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: ‘Well, I still\nwant to play with you’. Bottum did the same thing. It was another one of these\n‘firing somebody without firing them’ scenarios.\"[12]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/FNM_PP_TRT.jpg/220px-\nFNM_PP_TRT.jpg)](/wiki/File:FNM_PP_TRT.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FNM_PP_TRT.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFaith No More in a promotional photo for _[The Real\nThing](/wiki/The_Real_Thing_\\(Faith_No_More_album\\) \"The Real Thing \\(Faith No\nMore album\\)\")_ , c. 1989-1990\n\n### Mike Patton joins and _The Real Thing_\n(1989–1991)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Faith_No_More&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Mike Patton joins and The Real Thing \\(1989–1991\\)\")]\n\nChuck Mosley was replaced with singer [Mike Patton](/wiki/Mike_Patton \"Mike\nPatton\") in 1988.

Starting with\na rumor posted to the Faith No More [newsgroup](/wiki/Newsgroup \"Newsgroup\")\nalt.music.faith-no-more claiming Mike Patton had quit the band in favor of\nside projects, this rumor, although denied at the time, proved to be at least\npartly true. Faith No More played their last show in Lisbon, Portugal on April\n7, 1998.[16] The band cancelled their planned support tour for\n[Aerosmith](/wiki/Aerosmith \"Aerosmith\") and on April 20, Billy Gould released\na statement by email and fax, saying \"[T]he decision among the members is\nmutual\" and \"the split will now enable each member to pursue his individual\nproject(s) unhindered.\" The band \"thank[ed] all of those fans and associates\nthat have stuck with and supported the band throughout its history.\"\n\nImmediately after the dissolution of Faith No More, the members went on to\nnumerous different projects. Mike Patton notably co-founded the supergroups\n[Fantômas](/wiki/Fant%C3%B4mas_\\(band\\) \"Fantômas \\(band\\)\") and\n[Tomahawk](/wiki/Tomahawk_\\(band\\) \"Tomahawk \\(band\\)\") in 1998-99, as well as\ncontinuing his original band [Mr. Bungle](/wiki/Mr._Bungle \"Mr. Bungle\"), who\nwere still signed with [Warner Bros. Records](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records\n\"Warner Bros. Records\"). The sound of Tomahawk in particular has often been\ncompared to Faith No More's mid-late 1990s output.[30][31]\n\nWhen Faith No More was brought up in a 1999 interview with _[The A.V.\nClub](/wiki/The_A.V._Club \"The A.V. Club\")_ , Patton (then fronting [Mr.\nBungle](/wiki/Mr._Bungle \"Mr. Bungle\")) stated \"I'm definitely glad it's over:\nIt was a great thing while it lasted, but it really had to end. I think if it\nhad continued it would have gotten really ugly. No fistfights or bloody noses\nor anything like that, but the music would have been substandard. So the line\nmust be drawn there.\"[32] In another interview from 2001, he similarly stated\nthat the band had broken up \"because we were starting to make bad music.\"[33]\nHowever, Gould did not share the same sentiment as Patton on the quality of\nthe band's late material, stating in 1998 \"However many records we sold or\ndidn't, we maintained over a long period of time a high standard of music that\nwe're proud of, and we never sucked. Whatever shit that happened to us on the\nway, thank God it didn't get in the way of the music.\"[34]\n\n### Reformation\n(2009–2012)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Faith_No_More&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Reformation \\(2009–2012\\)\")]\n\nRumours that Faith No More would reunite for shows in the\n[UK](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") in the summer of 2009 were\ncirculating in late November 2008,[35] but were originally dismissed by\nbassist Billy Gould. He explained: \"If anything like this were to happen, it\nwould have to come from the band, and I haven't spoken with any of them in\nover a year. So as far as I know, there isn't anything to talk about, and I'm\npretty sure that if you were to contact Patton, he would tell you the same\nthing.\"[36]\n\nHowever, on February 24, 2009 after months of speculation and rumors, Faith No\nMore announced they would be reforming with a line-up identical to the _[Album\nof the Year](/wiki/Album_of_the_Year_\\(Faith_No_More_album\\) \"Album of the\nYear \\(Faith No More album\\)\")_ era,[37] embarking on a reunion tour called\n_[The Second Coming Tour](/wiki/The_Second_Coming_Tour \"The Second Coming\nTour\")_. To coincide with the band's reunion tour, Rhino released the sixth\nFaith No More compilation, _[The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits\nCollection](/wiki/The_Very_Best_Definitive_Ultimate_Greatest_Hits_Collection\n\"The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits Collection\")_ , a double\nalbum that includes their hit singles and b sides & rarities, in the UK on\nJune 8.[38] Faith No More then played in major European festivals including\n[Download Festival](/wiki/Download_Festival \"Download Festival\") in the UK in\nJune, [Hurricane](/wiki/Hurricane_Festival \"Hurricane Festival\") and\n[Southside](/wiki/Southside_Festival \"Southside Festival\") festivals in\nGermany,[39] [Greenfield Festival](/wiki/Greenfield_Festival \"Greenfield\nFestival\") in [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland \"Switzerland\"),[40] [Hove\nFestival](/wiki/Hove_Festival \"Hove Festival\") in [Norway](/wiki/Norway\n\"Norway\") and [Roskilde Festival](/wiki/Roskilde_Festival \"Roskilde Festival\")\nin [Denmark](/wiki/Denmark \"Denmark\"),[41] among other dates.

On the first date (November 8, 2011), the band played a\n\"mystery song,\" which led to speculation of new material.[44] They played\nSonisphere France on July 7, 2012.[45] Following several more shows in Europe\nduring 2012, Faith No More became temporarily inactive again.

If you listen to Korn, if you listen to how the\nbass and the drums lock up, it's quite similar to how Faith No More was doing\nit in their early years.\"[100]\n\nFaith No More have been covered by prominent metal acts such as [36\nCrazyfists](/wiki/36_Crazyfists \"36 Crazyfists\"),[101]\n[Apocalyptica](/wiki/Apocalyptica \"Apocalyptica\"),[102] [Atreyu](/wiki/Atreyu\n\"Atreyu\"),[103] [Between the Buried and Me](/wiki/Between_the_Buried_and_Me\n\"Between the Buried and Me\"),[104] [Disturbed](/wiki/Disturbed_\\(band\\)\n\"Disturbed \\(band\\)\"),[105] [Five Finger Death\nPunch](/wiki/Five_Finger_Death_Punch \"Five Finger Death Punch\"),[106]\n[Helloween](/wiki/Helloween \"Helloween\"),[107] [Ill Niño](/wiki/Ill_Ni%C3%B1o\n\"Ill Niño\"),[108] Korn,[109] [Machine Head](/wiki/Machine_Head_\\(band\\)\n\"Machine Head \\(band\\)\"),[110] Papa Roach,[111]\n[Redemption](/wiki/Redemption_\\(band\\) \"Redemption \\(band\\)\"),[112]\n[Revocation](/wiki/Revocation_\\(band\\) \"Revocation \\(band\\)\"),[113]\n[Sentenced](/wiki/Sentenced \"Sentenced\"),[114] [Slaves on\nDope](/wiki/Slaves_on_Dope \"Slaves on Dope\")[115] and [Trail of\nTears](/wiki/Trail_of_Tears_\\(band\\) \"Trail of Tears \\(band\\)\").[116] In 2002,\na tribute album titled _[Tribute of the\nYear](/wiki/Tribute_of_the_Year:_A_Tribute_to_Faith_No_More \"Tribute of the\nYear: A Tribute to Faith No More\")_ (a reference to Faith No More's _[Album of\nthe Year](/wiki/Album_of_the_Year_\\(Faith_No_More_album\\) \"Album of the Year\n\\(Faith No More album\\)\")_) was released by [Underground\nInc.](/wiki/Underground_Inc. \"Underground Inc.\") It featured 30 Faith No More\nsongs covered by mostly unknown independent [hardcore](/wiki/Hardcore_punk\n\"Hardcore punk\"), [industrial](/wiki/Industrial_metal \"Industrial metal\") and\nalternative metal acts.[117]\n\nThe band and their 1989[note1] single\n\"[Epic](/wiki/Epic_\\(Faith_No_More_song\\) \"Epic \\(Faith No More song\\)\")\" have\nfrequently been cited as an example of an '80s or '90s [one-hit\nwonder](/wiki/One-hit_wonder \"One-hit wonder\").[118][119][120] _Flavorwire_\nstated in 2014 \"Although the band always had a loyal fan base and Patton\nremains an indie hero, they only cracked the Billboard Hot 100 once, with\nEpic.\" Others have noted that after \"Epic\"'s success, the band still managed\nto remain highly popular in regions outside North America: including\nAustralia, South America, Europe and the UK.[121] The band's original final\nrecord _Album of the Year_ notably experienced high sales in countries such as\nAustralia (where it went platinum),[122] New Zealand and Germany, while being\ndeemed a critical and commercial failure in their native USA.\n\n### Relationship with Red Hot Chili\nPeppers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Faith_No_More&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers\")]\n\nMain article: [Anthony Kiedis § Feud with Mike\nPatton](/wiki/Anthony_Kiedis#Feud_with_Mike_Patton \"Anthony Kiedis\")\n\nAfter the release of _[The Real\nThing](/wiki/The_Real_Thing_\\(Faith_No_More_album\\) \"The Real Thing \\(Faith No\nMore album\\)\")_ , Faith No More developed somewhat of a rivalry with fellow\nCalifornian [funk rock](/wiki/Funk_rock \"Funk rock\") group [Red Hot Chili\nPeppers](/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers \"Red Hot Chili Peppers\"), whom they had\npreviously played with on [The Uplift Mofo Party\nTour](/wiki/The_Uplift_Mofo_Party_Tour \"The Uplift Mofo Party\nTour\").[123][124] Singer [Anthony Kiedis](/wiki/Anthony_Kiedis \"Anthony\nKiedis\") accused [Mike Patton](/wiki/Mike_Patton \"Mike Patton\") of stealing\nhis \"style\" in the \"[Epic](/wiki/Epic_\\(Faith_No_More_song\\) \"Epic \\(Faith No\nMore song\\)\")\" music video.[125][124] He told _[Kerrang!](/wiki/Kerrang!\n\"Kerrang!\")_ magazine \"My [drummer](/wiki/Chad_Smith \"Chad Smith\") says he’s\ngonna kidnap [Patton], shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so\nhe’ll be forced to find a style of his own\".[124] In a separate interview, he\nclarified his comment, remarking \"I love _The Real Thing_ , and I liked his\nvocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle\nsimilarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what\nthe fuck?.'\"[125] [Roddy Bottum](/wiki/Roddy_Bottum \"Roddy Bottum\") responded\nby saying \"To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If\nyou're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can\nsee similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them\nsince this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and\ni'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour\".[126] Mike Patton\nfinally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that \"It\njust kind of came out of the blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real\nbig kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me\nin interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate\nor old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him.\"[127]\nLater in 2001, Patton also theorized that \"I think Anthony, deep down, feels\nlike I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little\nbit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could\noutdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a [breakoff](/wiki/Breakdancing\n\"Breakdancing\"), just breakdance.\"[128]\n\nFollowing a period of silence, the feud between Patton and Kiedis quickly\nescalated again in 1999 with Patton's other band [Mr. Bungle](/wiki/Mr._Bungle\n\"Mr. Bungle\"), culminating in an infamous Halloween show during 1999 in which\nPatton (dressed as Kiedis) and his bandmates parodied the Red Hot Chili\nPeppers and their hit singles.[124] The performance was in response to getting\nkicked off a series of lucrative festival gigs shared with Red Hot Chili\nPeppers, due to Kiedis's staunch refusal to perform with Mike Patton.[124]\n\nDespite this, other members of both groups appear to have remained on good\nterms since the initial controversy. Regarding the perceived conflict, Red Hot\nChili Peppers bassist [Flea](/wiki/Flea_\\(musician\\) \"Flea \\(musician\\)\")\nstated \"There was never any fight between us, that was a bunch of bullshit\ncreated by the media. I mean I think they're a good band. Maybe there was some\nthings said between [Anthony](/wiki/Anthony_Kiedis \"Anthony Kiedis\") and the\nsinger [Patton], but it all means nothing to me. Those guys in the band are\nnice people and there's no fight.\"[129] At a 2014 show in\n[Brooklyn](/wiki/Brooklyn \"Brooklyn\"), the band also notably covered a portion\nof the [Chuck Mosley](/wiki/Chuck_Mosley \"Chuck Mosley\")-era song \"[We Care a\nLot](/wiki/We_Care_a_Lot_\\(song\\) \"We Care a Lot \\(song\\)\")\".[124]\n\n[Fox News](/wiki/Fox_News \"Fox News\") commentator [Greg\nGutfeld](/wiki/Greg_Gutfeld \"Greg Gutfeld\") attracted media attention in 2016\nwhen he stated \"You’re either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers\nfan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two\ndifferent people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony\nKiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the\nuniverse, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the\nuniverse.\"[130][131]\n\n## Concert\ntours[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Faith_No_More&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Concert tours\")]\n\n  * 1979–1984: Early shows\n  * 1985–1986: We Care a Lot Tour\n  * 1987–1988: Introduce Yourself Tour\n  * 1989–1991: The Real Thing Tour\n  * 1992–1993: Angel Dust Tour\n  * 1995: King for a Day Tour\n  * 1997–1998: Album of the Year Tour\n  * 2009–2012: [The Second Coming Tour](/wiki/The_Second_Coming_Tour \"The Second Coming Tour\")\n  * 2015: [Soundwave Tour](/wiki/Soundwave_\\(Australian_music_festival\\) \"Soundwave \\(Australian music festival\\)\")\n  * 2015: [Sol Invictus Tour](/w/index.php?title=Sol_Invictus_Tour&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Sol Invictus Tour \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n\n## Members[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Faith_No_More&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Members\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Faith No More band\nmembers](/wiki/List_of_Faith_No_More_band_members \"List of Faith No More band\nmembers\")\n\nCurrent members\n\n  * [Mike Bordin](/wiki/Mike_Bordin \"Mike Bordin\") – drums, percussion, backing vocals (1979–1998; 2009–present)\n  * [Billy Gould](/wiki/Billy_Gould \"Billy Gould\") – bass, backing vocals (1979–1998; 2009–present)\n  * [Roddy Bottum](/wiki/Roddy_Bottum \"Roddy Bottum\") – keyboards, rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1983[132]–1998; 2009–present)\n  * [Mike Patton](/wiki/Mike_Patton \"Mike Patton\") – [lead vocals](/wiki/Vocalist \"Vocalist\") (1988–1998; 2009–present)\n  * [Jon Hudson](/wiki/Jon_Hudson \"Jon Hudson\") – lead guitar, backing vocals (1996–1998; 2009–present)\n\nTimeline\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/69f2565d61307c686983eedd49076938.png)\n\n## Awards and\nnominations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Faith_No_More&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Awards and nominations\")]\n\n[Grammy Awards](/wiki/Grammy_Awards \"Grammy Awards\")\n\nYear | Nominee/work | Award | Result  \n---|---|---|---  \n1990 | \"[The Real Thing](/wiki/The_Real_Thing_\\(Faith_No_More_album\\) \"The Real Thing \\(Faith No More album\\)\")\" | [Best Metal Performance](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Metal_Performance \"Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance\") | Nominated  \n1991 | \"[Epic](/wiki/Epic_\\(Faith_No_More_song\\) \"Epic \\(Faith No More song\\)\")\" | [Best Hard Rock Performance](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Hard_Rock_Performance \"Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance\") | Nominated  \n1993 | \"[Angel Dust](/wiki/Angel_Dust_\\(Faith_No_More_album\\) \"Angel Dust \\(Faith No More album\\)\")\" | [Best Hard Rock Performance](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Hard_Rock_Performance \"Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance\") | Nominated  \n  \n  \n\n[MTV Video Music Awards](/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Awards \"MTV Video Music\nAwards\")\n\nYear | Nominee/work | Award | Result  \n---|---|---|---  \n1990 | \"[Epic](/wiki/Epic_\\(Faith_No_More_song\\) \"Epic \\(Faith No More song\\)\")\" | [Best Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Video](/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_Rock_Video \"MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video\") | Nominated  \n1991 | \"[Falling to Pieces](/wiki/Falling_to_Pieces \"Falling to Pieces\")\" | [Best Art Direction in a Video](/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_Art_Direction \"MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction\") | Nominated  \n1991 | \"[Falling to Pieces](/wiki/Falling_to_Pieces \"Falling to Pieces\")\" | [Best Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Video](/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_Rock_Video \"MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video\") | Nominated  \n1991 | \"[Falling to Pieces](/wiki/Falling_to_Pieces \"Falling to Pieces\")\" | [Best Visual Effects in a Video](/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_Visual_Effects \"MTV Video Music Award for Best Visual Effects\") | Won  \n1993 | \"[A Small Victory](/wiki/A_Small_Victory \"A Small Victory\")\" | [Best Art Direction in a Video](/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award_for_Best_Art_Direction \"MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction\") | Nominated  \n  \n## Discography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Faith_No_More&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Discography\")]\n\nMain article: [Faith No More discography](/wiki/Faith_No_More_discography\n\"Faith No More discography\")\n\nStudio albums\n\n  * _[We Care a Lot](/wiki/We_Care_a_Lot \"We Care a Lot\")_ (1985)\n  * _[Introduce Yourself](/wiki/Introduce_Yourself \"Introduce Yourself\")_ (1987)\n  * _[The Real Thing](/wiki/The_Real_Thing_\\(Faith_No_More_album\\) \"The Real Thing \\(Faith No More album\\)\")_ (1989)\n  * _[Angel Dust](/wiki/Angel_Dust_\\(Faith_No_More_album\\) \"Angel Dust \\(Faith No More album\\)\")_ (1992)\n  * _[King for a Day...
