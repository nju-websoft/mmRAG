He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested\nGaston Leroux's book _[The Phantom of the\nOpera](/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera \"The Phantom of the Opera\")_ as a basis.\nThey screened both the [1925 Lon\nChaney](/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1925_film\\) \"The Phantom of the Opera\n\\(1925 film\\)\") and the [1943 Claude\nRains](/wiki/Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1943_film\\) \"Phantom of the Opera \\(1943\nfilm\\)\") motion picture versions, but neither saw an effective way to make the\nleap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand\ncopy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the\nnecessary inspiration to develop a musical: \"I was actually writing something\nelse at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I\nwas trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that\never since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!\"[12]\n\n###\nLyricists[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1986_musical\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Lyricists\")]\n\nLloyd Webber first approached [Jim Steinman](/wiki/Jim_Steinman \"Jim\nSteinman\") to write the lyrics because of his \"dark obsessive side\", but he\ndeclined in order to fulfill his commitments on a [Bonnie\nTyler](/wiki/Bonnie_Tyler \"Bonnie Tyler\") album.[13] [Alan Jay\nLerner](/wiki/Alan_Jay_Lerner \"Alan Jay Lerner\") was then recruited, but he\nbecame seriously ill after joining the project and was forced to withdraw;\nnone of his contributions (mostly involving the song \"Masquerade\") are\ncredited in the show.[14][15] [Richard Stilgoe](/wiki/Richard_Stilgoe \"Richard\nStilgoe\"), the lyricist for _[Starlight Express](/wiki/Starlight_Express\n\"Starlight Express\"),_ wrote most of the original lyrics for the production.\n[Charles Hart](/wiki/Charles_Hart_\\(lyricist\\) \"Charles Hart \\(lyricist\\)\"), a\nyoung and then-relatively unknown lyricist, later rewrote many of the lyrics,\nalong with original lyrics for \"Think of Me\". Some of Stilgoe's original\ncontributions are still present in the final version, however.[16]\n\n###\nScore[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1986_musical\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Score\")]\n\nInspired in part by an [earlier musical\nversion](/wiki/Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1976_musical\\) \"Phantom of the Opera\n\\(1976 musical\\)\") of the same story by [Ken\nHill](/wiki/Ken_Hill_\\(playwright\\) \"Ken Hill \\(playwright\\)\"),[17] Lloyd\nWebber's score is sometimes operatic in style but maintains the form and\nstructure of a musical throughout. The full-fledged operatic passages are\nreserved principally for subsidiary characters such as Andre and Firmin,\nCarlotta, and Piangi. They are also used to provide the content of the\nfictional \"operas\" that are taking place within the show itself, viz.,\n_Hannibal_ , _Il Muto_ , and the Phantom's masterwork, _Don Juan Triumphant_.\n\"Here, Lloyd Webber pastiched various styles from the grand operas of\n[Meyerbeer](/wiki/Meyerbeer \"Meyerbeer\") through to [Mozart](/wiki/Mozart\n\"Mozart\") and even [Gilbert and Sullivan](/wiki/Gilbert_and_Sullivan \"Gilbert\nand Sullivan\").\"[18] These pieces are often presented as musical fragments,\ninterrupted by dialogue or action sequences in order to clearly define the\nmusical's \"show within a show\" format. The musical extracts from the Phantom's\nopera, \"Don Juan Triumphant\", during the latter stages of the show, are\ndissonant and modern—\"suggesting, perhaps, that the Phantom is ahead of his\ntime artistically\".[19]\n\n### Design, direction, and\nchoreography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1986_musical\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Design, direction, and choreography\")]\n\n[Maria Björnson](/wiki/Maria_Bj%C3%B6rnson \"Maria Björnson\") designed the sets\nand over 200 costumes, including the elaborate gowns in the \"Masquerade\"\nsequence.

This very preliminary production used Richard Stilgoe's\noriginal unaltered lyrics, and many songs sported names that were later\nchanged, such as \"What Has Time Done to Me\" (\"Think of Me\"), and \"Papers\"\n(\"Notes\"). The Phantom's original mask covered the entire face and remained in\nplace throughout the performance, obscuring the actor's vision and muffling\nhis voice. Björnson designed the now-iconic half-mask to replace it, and the\nunmasking sequence was added.[16] Clips of this preview performance were\nincluded on the DVD of the 2004 film production.[22]\n\n### West\nEnd[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1986_musical\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: West End\")]\n\n_Phantom_ began previews at [Her Majesty's\nTheatre](/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Theatre \"Her Majesty's Theatre\") in London's\nWest End on 27 September 1986 under the direction of Hal Prince, then opened\non 9 October.

As the porters\nremove the drop cloth covering the fixture, it flickers to life and ascends to\nthe ceiling as the auditorium's former grandeur is restored (\"Overture\").\n\n### Act\nI[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1986_musical\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Act I\")]\n\nIt is now 1881[37] and the cast of a new production, _Hannibal_ , are\nrehearsing onstage when they learn that new owners, Firmin and André, are\ntaking over the Opéra Populaire. Carlotta, the Opéra's resident soprano [prima\ndonna](/wiki/Prima_donna \"Prima donna\"), begins to perform an aria for the new\nmanagers when a backdrop inexplicably falls from the flies, barely missing her\nand prompting anxious chorus girls to whisper, \"He's here! The Phantom of the\nOpera!\". The managers try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta angrily\ninsists that such things happen all the time and she storms out _._ Madame\nGiry, the Opéra's ballet mistress, informs Firmin and André that [Christine\nDaaé](/wiki/Christine_Daa%C3%A9 \"Christine Daaé\"), a chorus girl and orphaned\ndaughter of a prominent violinist, has been \"well taught\" and can sing\nCarlotta's role. With cancellation of the sold out show being their only other\nalternative, the managers reluctantly audition Christine and are surprised to\ndiscover that she is indeed up to the challenge. As Christine sings the aria\nduring the evening performance, the Opéra's new patron, Raoul, the Vicomte de\nChagny, recognizes her as his childhood friend and playmate (\"Think of Me\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/PhantomoftheOpera-\nBoatScene.PNG/250px-PhantomoftheOpera-\nBoatScene.PNG)](/wiki/File:PhantomoftheOpera-BoatScene.PNG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PhantomoftheOpera-BoatScene.PNG \"Enlarge\")\n\nMichael Crawford and Sarah Brightman performing the title song\n\nBackstage after her triumphant début, Christine confesses to her best friend\nMeg (Madame Giry's daughter) that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an\ninvisible \"Angel of Music\" (\"Angel of Music\"). Raoul pays a visit to\nChristine's dressing room. The two reminisce about the \"Angel of Music\"\nstories that her late father used to tell them and Christine confides that the\nAngel has visited her and taught her to sing (\"Little Lotte\"). Raoul indulges\nwhat he assumes are fantasies and insists on taking Christine to dinner. When\nRaoul leaves to fetch his hat, Christine hears the jealous Phantom's voice and\nshe entreats him to reveal himself. The Phantom obliges by appearing as a\nghostly, partially masked face in her mirror (\"The Mirror/Angel of Music\n(Reprise)\"). Believing him to be the Angel of Music sent by her deceased\nfather, Christine is irresistibly drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who\nleads her down into the cellars of the Opéra house. The two then board a small\nboat and cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair (\"[The Phantom of the\nOpera](/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(Andrew_Lloyd_Webber_song\\) \"The\nPhantom of the Opera \\(Andrew Lloyd Webber song\\)\")\"). The Phantom explains\nthat he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her. When he\nreveals a mirror that reflects an image of her in a wedding dress, the figure\nin the mirror gestures to Christine and she faints. The Phantom then covers\nher tenderly with his cloak (\"[The Music of the\nNight](/wiki/The_Music_of_the_Night \"The Music of the Night\")\").\n\nAs the Phantom is composing music at his organ, Christine awakens to the sound\nof the monkey music box (\"I Remember\"). Overcome with curiosity, she slips\nbehind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his grotesquely disfigured\nface. The Phantom rails at her prying gesture, as Christine hides in fear. He\nthen ruefully expresses his longing to look normal, and to be loved by her\n(\"Stranger Than You Dreamt It\"). Moved by pity, Christine returns the\nPhantom's mask to him and the Phantom shepherds her back above ground.\n\nMeanwhile, [Joseph Buquet](/wiki/Joseph_Buquet \"Joseph Buquet\"), the Opéra's\nchief stagehand, regales the chorus girls with tales of the \"Opéra Ghost\" and\nhis terrible [Punjab lasso](/wiki/Punjab_lasso \"Punjab lasso\") (\"Magical\nLasso\"). Madame Giry arrives and warns Buquet to exercise restraint or face\nthe Phantom's wrath. In the managers' office, André and Firman read notes from\nthe Phantom aloud and are interrupted by Raoul, who accuses them of sending\nhim a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again.\nCarlotta and Piangi then burst into the office, demanding to know who sent\nCarlotta a note saying that her days at the Opera Populaire are numbered. As\nAndré and Firmin try to calm the distressed Carlotta, Madame Giry delivers\nanother note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta in\nthe new opera, _Il Muto_ , lest they face a \"disaster beyond imagination\"\n(\"Notes...\"). Firmin and André dismiss the threat and assure an enraged\nCarlotta that she will remain their star (\"Prima Donna\").\n\nThe première of _Il Muto_ initially goes well, until the voice of the Phantom\nsuddenly cuts through the performance, enraged that Box 5 was not kept empty\nfor him. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotta\nreminds her that her role is silent, calling her a \"little toad\". The Phantom\nstates that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces Carlotta's voice to a\nfrog-like croak. Firmin quickly tries to calm the situation by telling the\naudience that Christine will take over the starring role, moving forward the\nballet to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Joseph Buquet\ndrops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Firmin and André plead\nfor calm as mayhem erupts and the Phantom's diabolical laughter is heard\nthroughout the auditorium (\"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\").\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof and tells him\nabout her subterranean encounter with the Phantom (\"Why Have You Brought Me\nHere?/Raoul, I've Been There\"). Raoul is skeptical but promises to love and\nprotect her, and Christine reciprocates his vow (\"[All I Ask of\nYou](/wiki/All_I_Ask_of_You \"All I Ask of You\")\"). The heartbroken Phantom,\nhaving overheard their entire conversation, angrily vows revenge before\nreturning to the auditorium and bringing down the chandelier. (\"All I Ask of\nYou (Reprise)\").\n\n### Act\nII[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1986_musical\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Act II\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/PotOFinalScene.PNG/250px-\nPotOFinalScene.PNG)](/wiki/File:PotOFinalScene.PNG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PotOFinalScene.PNG \"Enlarge\")\n\nSteve Barton and Sarah Brightman in the final scene\n\nSix months later, in the midst of a [masquerade ball](/wiki/Masquerade_ball\n\"Masquerade ball\"), the Phantom makes his first appearance since the\nchandelier disaster, in costume as the [Red\nDeath](/wiki/The_Masque_of_the_Red_Death \"The Masque of the Red Death\"). He\nannounces that he has written an opera entitled _[Don Juan\nTriumphant](/wiki/Don_Juan_Triumphant \"Don Juan Triumphant\")_ and demands that\nit be produced immediately, with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to\nRaoul) in the lead role, and he warns of dire consequences if his demands are\nnot met (\"Masquerade/Why So Silent?\"). Noticing an engagement ring on a chain\naround Christine's neck, the Phantom angrily pulls it from her and vanishes in\na blinding flash of light. As the masquerade attendees scatter in fear, Raoul\naccosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the\nPhantom. Giry reluctantly explains that the Phantom is actually a brilliant\nscholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer who was born with a\nterrifyingly deformed face. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly\nexhibited in a cage as part of a travelling fair until he eventually escaped\nand disappeared. He has since taken refuge beneath the opera house, which has\nnow become his home.\n\nDuring rehearsals, Raoul – tired of the tyranny with which the Phantom rules\nthe Opera – thinks to use the première of _Don Juan Triumphant_ as a trap to\ncapture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all.\nCarlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind and that it is her\nplan so she can be the star. Christine angrily defends herself, saying she is\nnot the Phantom's accomplice, but his victim. Raoul, knowing of the Phantom's\nobsession with his fiancée, asserts that the Phantom will be sure to attend\nthe opera's première, and begs Christine to help him lure the Phantom into the\ntrap (\"Notes/Twisted Every Way\"). Torn between her love for Raoul and her fear\nof the Phantom, Christine visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance\nbut understanding that she must move on (\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here\nAgain\"). The Phantom appears atop the mausoleum, again under the guise of the\nAngel of Music (\"Wandering Child\"), and sings to Christine. Christine, tired\nand heartbroken, once again accepts her \"Angel\" as a friend, nearly succumbing\nto the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to both rescue her and confront\nThe Phantom. The Phantom taunts Raoul, hurling fire balls at him until\nChristine begs Raoul to leave with her (\"Bravo Monsieur\"). Furious, the\nPhantom declares war upon them both and causes flames to spring up around the\nmausoleum.\n\nWith armed policemen having secured the auditorium and watching for the\nPhantom, _Don Juan Triumphant_ premieres with Christine and Piangi singing the\nlead roles. During Don Juan's and Aminta's duet, Christine comes to the sudden\nrealization that she is singing not with Piangi, but with the Phantom himself\n(\"The Point of No Return\"). Mimicking Raoul's vow of devotion on the rooftop,\nthe Phantom once again expresses love for Christine and forces his ring onto\nher finger; Christine rips off his mask, exposing his horrifically deformed\nface to the shocked audience. The opera house is plunged into chaos. Piangi's\ngarroted body is revealed backstage, the cast and audience fly into a state of\npanic, and the Phantom seizes Christine and flees the theatre. An angry mob,\nvowing vengeance for the murders of Buquet and Piangi, searches the theatre\nfor the Phantom, while Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's\nsubterranean lair, and warns him to beware his magical lasso. (\"Down Once\nMore/Track Down This Murderer\").\n\nIn the lair, Christine is forced to don a wedding dress. Raoul finds the lair\nand attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine, begging him to show\ncompassion. The Phantom refuses, and captures Raoul with the Punjab lasso. The\nPhantom tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees to stay with him\nforever, but if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the\nPhantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and\nRaoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the\nPhantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him,\nshowing him compassion for the first time in his life. The Phantom, having\nexperienced kindness at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to\nlove him, and sets them both free. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair,\nbut she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom tells\nChristine he loves her, before she tearfully exits with Raoul. The weeping\nPhantom huddles on his throne and covers himself with his cloak. The mob, led\nby Meg, enters the lair. Meg pulls the Phantom's cloak from the throne,\nfinding only his mask on the seat. She lifts the mask up into the light and\ngazes at it in wonder as the curtain falls.[38]\n\n##\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_\\(1986_musical\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.
