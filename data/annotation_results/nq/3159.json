M. Montgomery). Written for all ages, it has been considered a classic\nchildren's novel since the mid-twentieth century. Set in the late 19th\ncentury, the novel recounts the adventures of [Anne\nShirley](/wiki/Anne_Shirley \"Anne Shirley\"), an 11-year-old\n[orphan](/wiki/Orphan \"Orphan\") girl who is mistakenly sent to Matthew and\nMarilla Cuthbert, a middle-aged brother and sister who had intended to\n[adopt](/wiki/Adopt \"Adopt\") a boy to help them on their farm in the fictional\ntown of Avonlea on [Prince Edward Island](/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island \"Prince\nEdward Island\"). The novel recounts how Anne makes her way with the Cuthberts,\nin school, and within the town.\n\nSince its publication, _Anne of Green Gables_ has sold more than 50 million\ncopies and has been translated into at least 36 languages. Montgomery wrote\nnumerous sequels, and since her death, another sequel has been published, as\nwell as an authorized prequel. The original book is taught to students around\nthe world.[4]\n\nThe book has been adapted as films, made-for-television movies, and animated\nand live-action television series. Musicals and plays have also been created,\nwith productions annually in Canada since 1964 of the first musical\nproduction, which has toured in Canada, the United States, Europe, and\nJapan.[5][6][7]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Plot summary\n  * 3 Characters\n    * 3.1 Green Gables household\n    * 3.2 Anne's schoolmates\n    * 3.3 Avonlea's locals\n    * 3.4 Others\n  * 4 Related works\n  * 5 Tourism and merchandising\n  * 6 Legacy and honours\n  * 7 Adaptations\n    * 7.1 Films\n    * 7.2 Literature\n    * 7.3 Radio productions\n    * 7.4 Stage productions\n    * 7.5 Television movies\n    * 7.6 Television series\n    * 7.7 Web productions\n  * 8 Parodies\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Bibliography\n  * 11 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Green_Gables&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Eickemeyer_nesbit.jpg/220px-\nEickemeyer_nesbit.jpg)](/wiki/File:Eickemeyer_nesbit.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Eickemeyer_nesbit.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe portrait of [Evelyn Nesbit](/wiki/Evelyn_Nesbit \"Evelyn Nesbit\") by\n[Rudolf Eickemeyer Jr.](/wiki/Rudolf_Eickemeyer_Jr. \"Rudolf Eickemeyer Jr.\")\nwhich inspired Montgomery.[8]\n\nIn writing the novel, Montgomery was inspired by notes she had made as a young\ngirl about a couple who were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of the boy\nthey had requested yet decided to keep her. She drew upon her own childhood\nexperiences in rural [Prince Edward Island](/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island \"Prince\nEdward Island\"), Canada. Montgomery used a photograph of [Evelyn\nNesbit](/wiki/Evelyn_Nesbit \"Evelyn Nesbit\"), which she had clipped from New\nYork’s _[Metropolitan Magazine](/wiki/Metropolitan_Magazine_\\(New_York\\)\n\"Metropolitan Magazine \\(New York\\)\")_ and put on the wall of her bedroom, as\nthe model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her \"youthful\nidealism and spirituality.\"[8]\n\nMontgomery was also inspired by the \"formula Ann\" orphan stories (called such\nbecause they followed such a predictable formula) which were popular at the\ntime and distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra\n\"e\".[9][10] She based other characters, such as [Gilbert\nBlythe](/wiki/Gilbert_Blythe \"Gilbert Blythe\"), in part on people she knew.\nShe said she wrote the novel in the twilight of the day, while sitting at her\nwindow and overlooking the fields of\n[Cavendish](/wiki/Cavendish,_Prince_Edward_Island \"Cavendish, Prince Edward\nIsland\").[11]\n\n## Plot\nsummary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Green_Gables&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Plot summary\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Thwack%21_-_M.A._and_W.A.J._Claus.jpg/220px-\nThwack%21_-_M.A._and_W.A.J._Claus.jpg)](/wiki/File:Thwack!_-_M.A._and_W.A.J._Claus.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Thwack!_-_M.A._and_W.A.J._Claus.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAnne attacks Gilbert\n\nAnne Shirley, a young orphan from the fictional community of Bolingbroke,\n[Nova Scotia](/wiki/Nova_Scotia \"Nova Scotia\") (based upon the real community\nof [New London, Prince Edward Island](/wiki/New_London,_Prince_Edward_Island\n\"New London, Prince Edward Island\")),[12][13] is sent to live with Marilla and\nMatthew Cuthbert, siblings in their fifties and sixties, after a childhood\nspent in strangers' homes and orphanages. Marilla and Matthew had originally\ndecided to adopt a boy from the orphanage to help Matthew run their farm at\n[Green Gables](/wiki/Green_Gables_\\(Prince_Edward_Island\\) \"Green Gables\n\\(Prince Edward Island\\)\"), which is set in the fictional town of Avonlea.\nThrough a misunderstanding, the orphanage sends Anne instead.\n\nAnne is highly imaginative, eager to please and, at times, quite a\n[dramatic](/wiki/Drama \"Drama\") individual. However, she is defensive about\nher appearance, despising her [red hair](/wiki/Red_hair \"Red hair\") and pale,\nthin frame. She is often quite talkative, especially when it comes to\ndescribing her fantasies and dreams. At first, stern and sharp Marilla says\nAnne must return to the orphanage, but after much observation and considering,\nalong with Matthew's strong liking to Anne, she decides to let her stay.\n\nAs a child of imagination, Anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly,\nthriving in the close-knit farming village. Her imagination and talkativeness\nsoon brighten up Green Gables.\n\nThe book recounts Anne's adventures in making a home: the country school where\nshe quickly excels in her studies; her friendship with Diana Barry, the girl\nliving next door (her best or \"bosom friend\" as Anne fondly calls her); her\nbudding literary ambitions; and her rivalry with her classmate [Gilbert\nBlythe](/wiki/Gilbert_Blythe \"Gilbert Blythe\"), who teases her about her red\nhair. For that, he earns her instant hatred, although he apologizes many\ntimes. As time passes, Anne realizes she no longer hates Gilbert but cannot\nbring herself to speak to him.\n\nThe book also follows Anne's adventures with her new-found friends. Episodes\ninclude her play-time with her friends Diana, a calm girl named Jane Andrews\nand a good-natured but often hysterical girl called Ruby Gillis, and her run-\nins with the unpleasant Pye sisters Gertie and Josie; and domestic mishaps\nsuch as dyeing her hair green while intending to dye it black, and\naccidentally getting Diana drunk by giving her what she thought was\n[raspberry](/wiki/Raspberry \"Raspberry\") [cordial](/wiki/Squash_\\(drink\\)\n\"Squash \\(drink\\)\") but turned out to be [currant](/wiki/Ribes \"Ribes\") wine.\n\nAt sixteen, Anne goes to Queen's Academy to earn a teaching license, along\nwith Gilbert, Ruby, Josie, Jane, and several other students, excluding Diana\nmuch to Anne's dismay. She obtains her license in one year instead of the\nusual two and wins the Avery Scholarship for the top student in English. Her\nattainment of this scholarship would allow her to pursue a Bachelor of Arts\n(B.A.) degree at the fictional Redmond College (based on the real [Dalhousie\nUniversity](/wiki/Dalhousie_University \"Dalhousie University\")) on the\nmainland in Nova Scotia.\n\nNear the end of the book however, tragedy strikes when Matthew dies of a heart\nattack after learning that all of his and Marilla's money has been lost in a\n[bank failure](/wiki/Bank_failure \"Bank failure\"). Out of devotion to Marilla\nand Green Gables, Anne gives up the scholarship to stay at home and help\nMarilla, whose eyesight is failing. She plans to teach at the Carmody school,\nthe nearest school available, and return to Green Gables on weekends. In an\nact of friendship, Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position at the\nAvonlea School to work at the White Sands School instead, knowing that Anne\nwants to stay close to Marilla after Matthew's death. After this kind act,\nAnne and Gilbert's friendship is cemented, and Anne looks forward to what life\nwill bring next.\n\n##\nCharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Green_Gables&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Characters\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/There%27s_Something_So_Stylish_About_You%2C_Anne_-\n_M.A._and_W.A.J._Claus.jpg/220px-\nThere%27s_Something_So_Stylish_About_You%2C_Anne_-\n_M.A._and_W.A.J._Claus.jpg)](/wiki/File:There%27s_Something_So_Stylish_About_You,_Anne_-\n_M.A._and_W.A.J._Claus.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:There%27s_Something_So_Stylish_About_You,_Anne_-\n_M.A._and_W.A.J._Claus.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDiana and Anne\n\n### Green Gables\nhousehold[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Green_Gables&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Green Gables household\")]\n\n  * **[Anne Shirley](/wiki/Anne_Shirley \"Anne Shirley\")** : An imaginative, talkative, red-headed orphan who comes to live with Matthew Cuthbert and Marilla Cuthbert. Anne is very sensitive and dislikes the color of her hair. She exhibits categorical interest in everything romantic.\n  * **Marilla Cuthbert** : Matthew's sister, she is an austere but fair woman who objects to Anne's imaginative, unusual conduct on the grounds of its being part of the same group of behavioral misconducts that bring about dereliction of responsibility or produce a disrespectful personal image. Life experience with Anne, however, profoundly affects Marilla's ways; in a very early instance, she experiences first-hand how worthless a confession under duress could be. Although conservative and austere, she is fond of Anne and has the glimmerings of a sense of humor.\n  * **Matthew Cuthbert** : Marilla's brother, he is an overly shy, albeit kind, old man with a lumbering frame and above-average strength. Matthew takes a liking to Anne from the start and the two become fast friends. Because Marilla has primary responsibility for rearing the girl, he has no qualms about \"spoiling\" her and indulging her in pretty clothes and other frivolities.\n\n### Anne's\nschoolmates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Green_Gables&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Anne's schoolmates\")]\n\n  * **Diana Barry** : Anne's bosom friend and a kindred spirit. Anne and Diana become best friends from the moment they meet. She is the only girl of Anne's age who lives close to Green Gables. Anne admires Diana for being pretty and for her amiable disposition. Diana lacks Anne's powerful imagination but is a loyal friend.\n  * **[Gilbert Blythe](/wiki/Gilbert_Blythe \"Gilbert Blythe\")** : A handsome, smart, witty and [chivalrous](/wiki/Chivalrous \"Chivalrous\") classmate who has a crush on Anne the moment he sees her. Unaware of Anne's near-pathological sensitivity about her red hair, he tries to get Anne's attention by holding her braid and calling her \"Carrots\". Anne's explosively hostile reaction only causes Gilbert to be more smitten. He makes several attempts to apologize, the failure of all of which do not seem to mar his admiration. He attempts to apologize one last time when he saves Anne from drowning; Anne crassly rebuffs this attempt, only to regret it almost immediately. Years later, he gives up his job offer of teaching at the Avonlea school so that Anne may live at Green Gables, upon which the two reconcile and become good friends (and eventually marry).\n  * **Ruby Gillis** : Another of Anne's friends. Having several \"grown up\" sisters, Ruby loves to share her knowledge of beaux with her friends. Ruby is portrayed as traditionally beautiful with long golden hair. She is hysterical and suffers from consumption ([tuberculosis](/wiki/Tuberculosis \"Tuberculosis\")).\n  * **Jane Andrews** : One of Anne's friends from school, she is plain and sensible. She does well enough academically to join Anne's class at Queen's.\n  * **Josie Pye** : A classmate generally disliked by the other girls (as are her siblings), Josie is vain, dishonest, and [jealous](/wiki/Jealous \"Jealous\") of Anne's popularity.\n\n### Avonlea's\nlocals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Green_Gables&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Avonlea's locals\")]\n\n  * **Mrs. Rachel Lynde** : A neighbour of Matthew and Marilla, Mrs. Lynde is an amalgamation of vices and virtues. She is industrious and helpful, and does work for the church, yet she is famous for being nosy and condescending. Although she and Anne start off the wrong foot, owing to Mrs. Lynde's blunt criticism and Anne's short temper, they soon become quite close. Mrs. Lynde is married and has raised ten children, although her husband, Thomas Lynde, is mentioned briefly and never speaks.\n  * **Mr. Phillips** : Anne's first teacher at Avonlea, Mr. Phillips is unpopular with students, because of his boring and crude ways. In Anne's case, he continually misspells her name (without the \"E\") and punishes only her among twelve pupils who arrive late. He is described as lacking discipline, and \"courts\" one of his pupils openly (this was less frowned upon then as opposed to more contemporary times).\n  * **Miss Muriel Stacy** : Anne's energetic replacement teacher. Her warm and sympathetic nature appeals to her students, but Avonlea's conservative parents disapprove of her liberal teaching methods. She forms a special relationship with Anne, who views her as a mentor. Miss Stacy encourages Anne to develop her character and intellect and helps prepare her for the entrance exam at Queen's Academy, where she finishes in a tie for first with Gilbert Blythe.\n  * **Reverend and Mrs. Allan** : The minister and his wife also befriend Anne, with Mrs. Allan becoming particularly close. She is described as pretty.\n  * **Mr. & Mrs. Barry**: Diana's parents. Mr. Barry farms. Near the end of the book, he offers to rent some tracts to help out Anne and Marilla, after Matthew's passing. Mrs. Barry has a severe personality, expecting her children to follow strict rules. After Anne accidentally gets Diana drunk, Mrs. Barry rejects the girl, forbidding Diana to have anything to do with Anne. This sanction is repealed after Anne saves Minnie May.\n  * **Minnie May Barry** : Diana's baby sister, whose life is saved by Anne when she comes down with [croup](/wiki/Croup \"Croup\").\n\n###\nOthers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Green_Gables&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Others\")]\n\n  * **Miss Josephine Barry** : Diana's great-aunt. Initially portrayed in a negative light, she is quickly charmed by Anne's imagination, and eventually invites her and Diana to tea. She refers to Anne as \"the Anne-girl\" and even sends Anne beaded slippers as a Christmas present.\n  * **Mrs Hammond** : Anne had lived with her for a portion of her pre-Green-Gables life. She was very mean as a result of her husband′s death. Anne was treated more as a maid in her home than as a daughter or friend.\n\n## Related\nworks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Anne_of_Green_Gables&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Related works\")]\n\nBased on the popularity of her first book, Montgomery wrote a series of\nsequels to continue the story of her heroine Anne Shirley.
