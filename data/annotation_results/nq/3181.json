For other uses, see [Antibody\n(disambiguation)](/wiki/Antibody_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Antibody\n\\(disambiguation\\)\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Antibody.svg/255px-\nAntibody.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Antibody.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Antibody.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nEach antibody binds to a specific [antigen](/wiki/Antigen \"Antigen\"); an\ninteraction similar to a lock and key.\n\nAn **antibody** (**Ab**), also known as an **immunoglobulin** (**Ig**),[1] is\na large, Y-shaped [protein](/wiki/Protein \"Protein\") produced mainly by\n[plasma cells](/wiki/Plasma_cell \"Plasma cell\") that is used by the [immune\nsystem](/wiki/Immune_system \"Immune system\") to neutralize\n[pathogens](/wiki/Pathogen \"Pathogen\") such as [pathogenic\nbacteria](/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria \"Pathogenic bacteria\") and\n[viruses](/wiki/Viral_disease \"Viral disease\"). The antibody recognizes a\nunique molecule of the pathogen, called an [antigen](/wiki/Antigen \"Antigen\"),\nvia the [Fab's variable region](/wiki/Fragment_antigen-binding \"Fragment\nantigen-binding\").[2][3] Each tip of the \"Y\" of an antibody contains a\n[paratope](/wiki/Paratope \"Paratope\") (analogous to a lock) that is specific\nfor one particular [epitope](/wiki/Epitope \"Epitope\") (similarly analogous to\na key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with\nprecision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can _tag_ a\n[microbe](/wiki/Microbe \"Microbe\") or an infected cell for attack by other\nparts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for\nexample, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion\nand survival). Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological\nprocess causing the disease or may activate [macrophages](/wiki/Macrophages\n\"Macrophages\") to destroy the foreign substance. The ability of an antibody to\ncommunicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its\n[Fc region](/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region \"Fragment crystallizable\nregion\") (located at the base of the \"Y\"), which contains a conserved\n[glycosylation](/wiki/Glycosylation \"Glycosylation\") site involved in these\ninteractions.[4] The production of antibodies is the main function of the\n[humoral immune system](/wiki/Humoral_immune_system \"Humoral immune\nsystem\").[5]\n\nAntibodies are secreted by [B cells](/wiki/B_cell \"B cell\") of the adaptive\nimmune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called [plasma\ncells](/wiki/Plasma_cell \"Plasma cell\"). Antibodies can occur in two physical\nforms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the [blood\nplasma](/wiki/Blood_plasma \"Blood plasma\"), and a\n[membrane](/wiki/Cell_membrane \"Cell membrane\")-bound form that is attached to\nthe surface of a B cell and is referred to as the [B-cell\nreceptor](/wiki/B-cell_receptor \"B-cell receptor\") (BCR). The BCR is found\nonly on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells\nand their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called\n[plasma cells](/wiki/Plasma_cell \"Plasma cell\") or [memory B\ncells](/wiki/Memory_B_cell \"Memory B cell\") that will survive in the body and\nremember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future\nexposure.[6] In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a [T helper\ncell](/wiki/T_cell \"T cell\") is necessary to produce full activation of the B\ncell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding.[7] Soluble\nantibodies are released into the [blood](/wiki/Blood \"Blood\") and tissue\nfluids, as well as many [secretions](/wiki/Secretion \"Secretion\") to continue\nto survey for invading microorganisms.\n\nAntibodies are [glycoproteins](/wiki/Glycoprotein \"Glycoprotein\") belonging to\nthe [immunoglobulin superfamily](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_superfamily\n\"Immunoglobulin superfamily\").[4] They constitute most of the [gamma\nglobulin](/wiki/Gamma_globulin \"Gamma globulin\") fraction of the [blood\nproteins](/wiki/Blood_proteins \"Blood proteins\"). They are typically made of\nbasic structural units—each with two large [heavy\nchains](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_heavy_chain \"Immunoglobulin heavy chain\") and two\nsmall [light chains](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain \"Immunoglobulin light\nchain\"). There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that\ndefine the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may be\nattached to the antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc\nregions allow antibodies to be grouped into five\n_[isotypes](/wiki/Isotype_\\(immunology\\) \"Isotype \\(immunology\\)\")_. Each Fc\nregion of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc\nReceptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the\nantigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it\nbinds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further\nmodulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within\nits Fc region.[4] The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct\nthe appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they\nencounter.[8] For example, [IgE](/wiki/IgE \"IgE\") is responsible for an\n[allergic](/wiki/Allergic \"Allergic\") response consisting of [mast\ncell](/wiki/Mast_cell \"Mast cell\") degranulation and\n[histamine](/wiki/Histamine \"Histamine\") release. IgE's\n[Fab](/wiki/Fragment_antigen-binding \"Fragment antigen-binding\") paratope\nbinds to allergic [antigen](/wiki/Antigen \"Antigen\"), for example [house dust\nmite](/wiki/House_dust_mite \"House dust mite\") particles, while its Fc region\nbinds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic\nsignal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.[9]\n\nThough the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region\nat the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of\nantibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites,\nto exist. This region is known as the _hypervariable region_. Each of these\nvariants can bind to a different antigen.[2] This enormous diversity of\nantibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system\nto recognize an equally wide variety of antigens.[1] The large and diverse\npopulation of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of\na set of [gene](/wiki/Gene \"Gene\") segments that encode different antigen-\nbinding sites (or _paratopes_), followed by random [mutations](/wiki/Mutation\n\"Mutation\") in this area of the antibody gene, which create further\ndiversity.[8][10] This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody\nparatope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the\nantibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each\nparatope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one\nallele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then\njoined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope.\nThe regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper\nvariable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.\n\nAntibody genes also re-organize in a process called [class\nswitching](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_class_switching \"Immunoglobulin class\nswitching\") that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another,\ncreating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific\nvariable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by different types\nof Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Forms\n  * 2 Antibody–antigen interactions\n  * 3 Isotypes\n  * 4 Structure\n    * 4.1 Immunoglobulin domains\n    * 4.2 Heavy chain\n    * 4.3 Light chain\n    * 4.4 CDRs, Fv, Fab and Fc regions\n  * 5 Function\n    * 5.1 Activation of complement\n    * 5.2 Activation of effector cells\n    * 5.3 Natural antibodies\n  * 6 Immunoglobulin diversity\n    * 6.1 Domain variability\n    * 6.2 V(D)J recombination\n    * 6.3 Somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation\n    * 6.4 Class switching\n    * 6.5 Affinity designations\n    * 6.6 Asymmetrical antibodies\n  * 7 Medical applications\n    * 7.1 Disease diagnosis\n    * 7.2 Disease therapy\n    * 7.3 Prenatal therapy\n  * 8 Research applications\n  * 9 Regulations\n    * 9.1 Production and testing\n    * 9.2 Before clinical trials\n    * 9.3 Preclinical studies\n  * 10 Structure prediction\n  * 11 History\n  * 12 Antibody mimetic\n  * 13 See also\n  * 14 References\n  * 15 External links\n\n## Forms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Forms\")]\n\nThe membrane-bound form of an antibody may be called a _surface\nimmunoglobulin_ (sIg) or a _membrane immunoglobulin_ (mIg). It is part of the\n_B cell receptor_ (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific\nantigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation.[11] The BCR is\ncomposed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β\n[heterodimers](/wiki/Heterodimer \"Heterodimer\"), which are capable of [signal\ntransduction](/wiki/Signal_transduction \"Signal transduction\").[12] A typical\nhuman B cell will have 50,000 to 100,000 antibodies bound to its surface.[12]\nUpon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1\nmicrometer in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other\ncell signaling receptors.[12] These patches may improve the efficiency of the\n[cellular immune response](/wiki/Cell-mediated_immunity \"Cell-mediated\nimmunity\").[13] In humans, the cell surface is bare around the B cell\nreceptors for several hundred nanometers,[12] which further isolates the BCRs\nfrom competing influences.\n\n## Antibody–antigen\ninteractions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Antibody–antigen interactions\")]\n\nThe antibody's paratope interacts with the antigen's epitope. An antigen\nusually contains different epitopes along its surface arranged\ndiscontinuously, and dominant epitopes on a given antigen are called\ndeterminants.\n\nAntibody and antigen interact by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The\nmolecular forces involved in the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-\nspecific – for example [electrostatic forces](/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law \"Coulomb's\nlaw\"), [hydrogen bonds](/wiki/Hydrogen_bond \"Hydrogen bond\"), [hydrophobic\ninteractions](/wiki/Hydrophobic_interactions \"Hydrophobic interactions\"), and\n[van der Waals forces](/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force \"Van der Waals force\"). This\nmeans binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's\n[affinity](/wiki/Affinity_\\(pharmacology\\) \"Affinity \\(pharmacology\\)\")\ntowards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding\nalso means it is possible for an antibody to cross-react with different\nantigens of different relative affinities.\n\nOften, once an antibody and antigen bind, they become an [immune\ncomplex](/wiki/Immune_complex \"Immune complex\"), which functions as a unitary\nobject and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other\nantibodies. Similarly, [haptens](/wiki/Hapten \"Hapten\") are small molecules\nthat provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins,\nthe resulting complex or hapten-carrier [adduct](/wiki/Adduct \"Adduct\") is\nantigenic.\n\n## Isotypes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Isotypes\")]\n\nAntibodies can come in different varieties known as\n[isotypes](/wiki/Isotype_\\(immunology\\) \"Isotype \\(immunology\\)\") or classes.\nIn [placental](/wiki/Eutheria \"Eutheria\") mammals there are five antibody\nisotypes known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. They are each named with an\n\"Ig\" prefix that stands for immunoglobulin, a name sometimes used\ninterchangeably with antibody, and differ in their biological properties,\nfunctional locations and ability to deal with different antigens, as depicted\nin the table.[14] The different suffixes of the antibody isotypes denote the\ndifferent types of heavy chains the antibody contains, with each heavy chain\nclass named alphabetically: α (alpha), γ (gamma), δ (delta), ε (epsilon), and\nμ (mu). This gives rise to IgA, IgG, IgD, IgE, and IgM, respectively.\n\nAntibody isotypes of mammals Name | Types | Description | Antibody complexes  \n---|---|---|---  \n[IgA](/wiki/IgA \"IgA\") | 2 | Found in [mucosal](/wiki/Mucosal \"Mucosal\") areas, such as the [gut](/wiki/Gut_\\(zoology\\) \"Gut \\(zoology\\)\"), [respiratory tract](/wiki/Respiratory_tract \"Respiratory tract\") and [urogenital tract](/wiki/Urogenital_tract \"Urogenital tract\"), and prevents colonization by [pathogens](/wiki/Pathogen \"Pathogen\").[15] Also found in saliva, tears, and breast milk. | [![Some antibodies form complexes that bind to multiple antigen molecules.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Mono-und-Polymere.svg/170px-Mono-und-Polymere.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Mono-und-Polymere.svg \"Some antibodies form complexes that bind to multiple antigen molecules.\")  \n[IgD](/wiki/IgD \"IgD\") | 1 | Functions mainly as an [antigen](/wiki/Antigen \"Antigen\") receptor on B cells that have not been exposed to antigens.[16] It has been shown to activate [basophils](/wiki/Basophil \"Basophil\") and [mast cells](/wiki/Mast_cell \"Mast cell\") to produce [antimicrobial](/wiki/Antimicrobial \"Antimicrobial\") factors.[17]  \n[IgE](/wiki/IgE \"IgE\") | 1 | Binds to [allergens](/wiki/Allergen \"Allergen\") and triggers [histamine](/wiki/Histamine \"Histamine\") release from [mast cells](/wiki/Mast_cell \"Mast cell\") and [basophils](/wiki/Basophil \"Basophil\"), and is involved in [allergy](/wiki/Allergy \"Allergy\"). Also protects against [parasitic worms](/wiki/Parasitic_worm \"Parasitic worm\").[5]  \n[IgG](/wiki/IgG \"IgG\") | 4 | In its four forms, provides the majority of antibody-based immunity against invading pathogens.[5] The only antibody capable of crossing the [placenta](/wiki/Placenta \"Placenta\") to give passive immunity to the [fetus](/wiki/Fetus \"Fetus\").  \n[IgM](/wiki/IgM \"IgM\") | 1 | Expressed on the surface of B cells (monomer) and in a secreted form (pentamer) with very high [avidity](/wiki/Avidity \"Avidity\"). Eliminates pathogens in the early stages of B cell-mediated (humoral) immunity before there is sufficient IgG.[5][16]  \n  \nThe antibody isotype of a [B cell](/wiki/B_cell \"B cell\") changes during cell\n[development](/wiki/Pre-pre_B_cell \"Pre-pre B cell\") and activation. Immature\nB cells, which have never been exposed to an antigen, express only the IgM\nisotype in a cell surface bound form. The B lymphocyte, in this ready-to-\nrespond form, is known as a \"naive B lymphocyte.\" The naive B lymphocyte\nexpresses both surface IgM and IgD. The co-expression of both of these\nimmunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen.[18] B\ncell activation follows engagement of the cell-bound antibody molecule with an\nantigen, causing the cell to divide and\n[differentiate](/wiki/Cellular_differentiation \"Cellular differentiation\")\ninto an antibody-producing cell called a [plasma cell](/wiki/Plasma_cell\n\"Plasma cell\"). In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody\nin a [secreted](/wiki/Secretion \"Secretion\") form rather than a\n[membrane](/wiki/Cell_membrane \"Cell membrane\")-bound form. Some [daughter\ncells](/wiki/Daughter_cell \"Daughter cell\") of the activated B cells undergo\n[isotype switching](/wiki/Isotype_switching \"Isotype switching\"), a mechanism\nthat causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the\nother antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA, or IgG, that have defined roles in the\nimmune system.\n\nAntibody isotypes not found in mammals Name | Types | Description  \n---|---|---  \n[IgY](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_Y \"Immunoglobulin Y\") |  | Found in [birds](/wiki/Bird \"Bird\") and [reptiles](/wiki/Reptile \"Reptile\"); related to mammalian [IgG](/wiki/IgG \"IgG\").[19]  \nIgW |  | Found in [sharks and skates](/wiki/Elasmobranchii \"Elasmobranchii\"); related to mammalian IgD.[20]  \n  \n## Structure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Structure\")]\n\nAntibodies are heavy (~150 k[Da](/wiki/Dalton_\\(unit\\) \"Dalton \\(unit\\)\"))\n[globular](/wiki/Globular_protein \"Globular protein\") [plasma\nproteins](/wiki/Plasma_protein \"Plasma protein\"). They have sugar chains\n(glycans) added to conserved [amino acid](/wiki/Amino_acid \"Amino acid\")\nresidues.[4][21] In other words, antibodies are\n_[glycoproteins](/wiki/Glycoprotein \"Glycoprotein\")_.[4] The attached glycans\nare critically important to the structure and function of the antibody.[4]\nAmong other things the expressed glycans can modulate an antibody's affinity\nfor its corresponding FcR(s).[4]\n\nThe basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig)\n[monomer](/wiki/Monomer \"Monomer\") (containing only one Ig unit); secreted\nantibodies can also be [dimeric](/wiki/Protein_dimer \"Protein dimer\") with two\nIg units as with IgA, [tetrameric](/wiki/Tetramer_protein \"Tetramer protein\")\nwith four Ig units like [teleost fish](/wiki/Teleost_fish \"Teleost fish\") IgM,\nor [pentameric](/wiki/Pentamer \"Pentamer\") with five Ig units, like mammalian\nIgM.[22]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Antibody_IgG2.png/220px-\nAntibody_IgG2.png)](/wiki/File:Antibody_IgG2.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Antibody_IgG2.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSeveral immunoglobulin domains make up the two heavy chains (red and blue) and\nthe two light chains (green and yellow) of an antibody. The immunoglobulin\ndomains are composed of between 7 (for constant domains) and 9 (for variable\ndomains) [β-strands](/wiki/%CE%92-strand \"Β-strand\").\n\nThe variable parts of an antibody are its V regions, and the constant part is\nits C region.\n\n### Immunoglobulin\ndomains[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Immunoglobulin domains\")]\n\nThe Ig monomer is a \"Y\"-shaped molecule that consists of four\n[polypeptide](/wiki/Polypeptide \"Polypeptide\") chains; two identical _heavy\nchains_ and two identical _light chains_ connected by [disulfide\nbonds](/wiki/Disulfide_bond \"Disulfide bond\").[14] Each chain is composed of\n[structural domains](/wiki/Structural_domain \"Structural domain\") called\n[immunoglobulin domains](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain \"Immunoglobulin domain\").\nThese domains contain about 70–110 [amino acids](/wiki/Amino_acid \"Amino\nacid\") and are classified into different categories (for example, variable or\nIgV, and constant or IgC) according to their size and function.[23] They have\na characteristic [immunoglobulin fold](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_fold\n\"Immunoglobulin fold\") in which two [beta sheets](/wiki/Beta_sheet \"Beta\nsheet\") create a \"sandwich\" shape, held together by interactions between\nconserved [cysteines](/wiki/Cysteine \"Cysteine\") and other charged amino\nacids.\n\n### Heavy chain[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Heavy chain\")]\n\nFor more details on this topic, see [Immunoglobulin heavy\nchain](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_heavy_chain \"Immunoglobulin heavy chain\").\n\nThere are five types of mammalian Ig [heavy\nchain](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_heavy_chain \"Immunoglobulin heavy chain\") denoted\nby the [Greek letters](/wiki/Greek_letters \"Greek letters\"): [α](/wiki/%CE%91\n\"Α\"), [δ](/wiki/%CE%94 \"Δ\"), [ε](/wiki/%CE%95 \"Ε\"), [γ](/wiki/%CE%93 \"Γ\"), and\n[μ](/wiki/%CE%9C \"Μ\").[2] The type of heavy chain present defines the _class_\nof antibody; these chains are found in IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies,\nrespectively.[1] Distinct heavy chains differ in size and composition; α and γ\ncontain approximately 450 amino acids, whereas μ and ε have approximately 550\n[amino acids](/wiki/Amino_acid \"Amino acid\").[2]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Immunoglobulin_basic_unit.svg/220px-\nImmunoglobulin_basic_unit.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Immunoglobulin_basic_unit.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Immunoglobulin_basic_unit.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n  1.

Hinge regions\n\nEach heavy chain has two regions, the _constant region_ and the _variable\nregion_. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same\nisotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α\nand δ have a constant region composed of _three_ tandem (in a line) Ig\n[domains](/wiki/Structural_domain \"Structural domain\"), and a hinge region for\nadded flexibility;[14] heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of\n_four_ immunoglobulin domains.[2] The variable region of the heavy chain\ndiffers in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is the same for all\nantibodies produced by a single B cell or [B cell\nclone](/wiki/Clone_\\(B-cell_biology\\) \"Clone \\(B-cell biology\\)\"). The\nvariable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and\nis composed of a single Ig domain.\n\n### Light chain[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Light chain\")]\n\nFor more details on this topic, see [Immunoglobulin light\nchain](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain \"Immunoglobulin light chain\").\n\nIn mammals there are two types of [immunoglobulin light\nchain](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain \"Immunoglobulin light chain\"), which\nare called [lambda](/wiki/Lambda \"Lambda\") (λ) and [kappa](/wiki/Kappa\n\"Kappa\") (κ).[2] A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain\nand one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217\namino acids.[2] Each antibody contains two light chains that are always\nidentical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in\nmammals. Other types of light chains, such as the [iota](/wiki/Iota \"Iota\")\n(ι) chain, are found in other [vertebrates](/wiki/Vertebrate \"Vertebrate\")\nlike sharks ([Chondrichthyes](/wiki/Chondrichthyes \"Chondrichthyes\")) and bony\nfishes ([Teleostei](/wiki/Teleostei \"Teleostei\")).\n\n### CDRs, Fv, Fab and Fc\nregions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: CDRs, Fv, Fab and Fc regions\")]\n\nSome parts of an antibody have the same functions. The arms of the Y, for\nexample, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical)\nand, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the\nantibody is called the _[Fab (fragment, antigen-binding)\nregion](/wiki/Fab_region \"Fab region\")_. It is composed of one constant and\none variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.[24] The\n[paratope](/wiki/Paratope \"Paratope\") is shaped at the [amino terminal\nend](/wiki/N-terminal_end \"N-terminal end\") of the antibody\n[monomer](/wiki/Monomer \"Monomer\") by the variable domains from the heavy and\nlight chains. The variable domain is also referred to as the FV region and is\nthe most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, variable\nloops of β-strands, there each on the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains are\nresponsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the\n[complementarity determining regions](/wiki/Complementarity_determining_region\n\"Complementarity determining region\") (CDRs). The structures of these CDRs\nhave been clustered and classified by Chothia et al.[25] and more recently by\nNorth et al.[26] and Nikoloudis et al.[27] In the framework of the [immune\nnetwork theory](/wiki/Immune_network_theory \"Immune network theory\"), CDRs are\nalso called idiotypes. According to immune network theory, the adaptive immune\nsystem is regulated by interactions between idiotypes.\n\nThe base of the Y plays a role in modulating immune cell activity. This region\nis called the _[Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region](/wiki/Fc_region \"Fc\nregion\")_ , and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three\nconstant domains depending on the class of the antibody.[2] Thus, the Fc\nregion ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for\na given antigen, by binding to a specific class of [Fc\nreceptors](/wiki/Fc_receptor \"Fc receptor\"), and other immune molecules, such\nas [complement](/wiki/Complement_system \"Complement system\") proteins. By\ndoing this, it mediates different [physiological](/wiki/Physiological\n\"Physiological\") effects including recognition of\n[opsonized](/wiki/Opsonization \"Opsonization\") particles (binding to FcγR),\n[lysis](/wiki/Lysis \"Lysis\") of cells (binding to complement), and\n[degranulation](/wiki/Degranulation \"Degranulation\") of [mast\ncells](/wiki/Mast_cell \"Mast cell\"), [basophils](/wiki/Basophil \"Basophil\"),\nand [eosinophils](/wiki/Eosinophil \"Eosinophil\") (binding to FcεR).[14][28]\n\nIn summary, the Fab region of the antibody determines antigen specificity\nwhile the Fc region of the antibody determines the antibody's class effect.\nSince only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of\nan antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class\neffects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma,\ndelta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E,\nand M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have\ndifferent class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and\nactivating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies\ninclude: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast\ncell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be\nmediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that\nFab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated\neffects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).\n\n## Function[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Function\")]\n\nFurther information: [Immune system](/wiki/Immune_system \"Immune system\")\n\nThe main categories of antibody action include the following:\n\n  * [Neutralisation](/wiki/Neutralisation_\\(immunology\\) \"Neutralisation \\(immunology\\)\"), in which [neutralizing antibodies](/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody \"Neutralizing antibody\") block parts of the surface of a bacterial cell or virion to render its attack ineffective\n  * [Agglutination](/wiki/Agglutination_\\(biology\\) \"Agglutination \\(biology\\)\"), in which antibodies \"glue together\" foreign cells into clumps that are attractive targets for [phagocytosis](/wiki/Phagocytosis \"Phagocytosis\")\n  * [Precipitation](/wiki/Precipitation_\\(chemistry\\) \"Precipitation \\(chemistry\\)\"), in which antibodies \"glue together\" [serum](/wiki/Blood_serum \"Blood serum\")-soluble antigens, forcing them to precipitate out of solution in clumps that are attractive targets for [phagocytosis](/wiki/Phagocytosis \"Phagocytosis\")\n  * [Complement activation](/wiki/Complement_system#Overview \"Complement system\") (fixation), in which antibodies that are latched onto a foreign cell encourage complement to attack it with a [membrane attack complex](/wiki/Membrane_attack_complex \"Membrane attack complex\"), which leads to the following: \n    * [Lysis](/wiki/Lysis \"Lysis\") of the foreign cell\n    * Encouragement of [inflammation](/wiki/Inflammation \"Inflammation\") by [chemotactically](/wiki/Chemotaxis \"Chemotaxis\") attracting inflammatory cells\n\nActivated B cells [differentiate](/wiki/Cellular_differentiation \"Cellular\ndifferentiation\") into either antibody-producing cells called [plasma\ncells](/wiki/Plasma_cell \"Plasma cell\") that secrete soluble antibody or\n[memory cells](/wiki/Memory_B_cell \"Memory B cell\") that survive in the body\nfor years afterward in order to allow the immune system to remember an antigen\nand respond faster upon future exposures.[29]\n\nAt the [prenatal](/wiki/Prenatal \"Prenatal\") and neonatal stages of life, the\npresence of antibodies is provided by [passive\nimmunization](/wiki/Passive_immunization \"Passive immunization\") from the\nmother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of\nantibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since\nantibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the\n[humoral immune system](/wiki/Humoral_immune_system \"Humoral immune system\").\nCirculating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically\nrespond to only one [antigen](/wiki/Antigen \"Antigen\") (an example is a\n[virus](/wiki/Virus \"Virus\") [capsid protein](/wiki/Capsid \"Capsid\")\nfragment). Antibodies contribute to [immunity](/wiki/Immunity_\\(medical\\)\n\"Immunity \\(medical\\)\") in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or\ndamaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by\n[macrophages](/wiki/Macrophages \"Macrophages\") and other cells by coating the\npathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other\n[immune responses](/wiki/Immune_response \"Immune response\") such as the\n[complement pathway](/wiki/Complement_system \"Complement system\").[30]\nAntibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to\nimmunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/IgM_white_background.png/220px-\nIgM_white_background.png)](/wiki/File:IgM_white_background.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:IgM_white_background.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe secreted mammalian [IgM](/wiki/IgM \"IgM\") has five Ig units. Each Ig unit\n(labeled 1) has two epitope binding [Fab regions](/wiki/Fab_region \"Fab\nregion\"), so IgM is capable of binding up to 10 epitopes.\n\n### Activation of\ncomplement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Activation of complement\")]\n\nAntibodies that bind to surface antigens (for example, on bacteria) will\nattract the first component of the [complement\ncascade](/wiki/Complement_cascade \"Complement cascade\") with their [Fc\nregion](/wiki/Fv_region \"Fv region\") and initiate activation of the\n\"classical\" complement system.[30] This results in the killing of bacteria in\ntwo ways.[5] First, the binding of the antibody and complement molecules marks\nthe microbe for ingestion by [phagocytes](/wiki/Phagocyte \"Phagocyte\") in a\nprocess called [opsonization](/wiki/Opsonization \"Opsonization\"); these\nphagocytes are attracted by certain complement molecules generated in the\ncomplement cascade. Second, some complement system components form a [membrane\nattack complex](/wiki/Complement_membrane_attack_complex \"Complement membrane\nattack complex\") to assist antibodies to kill the bacterium directly\n(bacteriolysis).[31]\n\n### Activation of effector\ncells[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section:\nActivation of effector cells\")]\n\nTo combat pathogens that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens\nto link them together, causing them to\n[agglutinate](/wiki/Agglutination_\\(biology\\) \"Agglutination \\(biology\\)\").\nSince an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can bind more than one\nantigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these\nantigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions\nagainst the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.[5]\n\nThose cells that recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, as the\nname suggests, interact with the [Fc region](/wiki/Fc_region \"Fc region\") of\nIgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the\nFc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell;\nphagocytes will [phagocytose](/wiki/Phagocytosis \"Phagocytosis\"), [mast\ncells](/wiki/Mast_cell \"Mast cell\") and [neutrophils](/wiki/Neutrophil\n\"Neutrophil\") will [degranulate](/wiki/Degranulation \"Degranulation\"),\n[natural killer cells](/wiki/Natural_killer_cell \"Natural killer cell\") will\nrelease [cytokines](/wiki/Cytokine \"Cytokine\") and [cytotoxic](/wiki/Cytotoxic\n\"Cytotoxic\") molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the\ninvading microbe. The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies\ninitiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as [antibody-dependent cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity](/wiki/Antibody-dependent_cell-mediated_cytotoxicity \"Antibody-\ndependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\") (ADCC) – this process may explain the\nefficacy of [monoclonal antibodies](/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody \"Monoclonal\nantibody\") used in [biological](/wiki/Biopharmaceutical \"Biopharmaceutical\")\ntherapies against [cancer](/wiki/Cancer \"Cancer\"). The Fc receptors are\nisotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system,\ninvoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.[2]\n\n### Natural\nantibodies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Natural antibodies\")]\n\nHumans and higher primates also produce \"natural antibodies\" that are present\nin serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as\nantibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination,\nother foreign antigen exposure or [passive\nimmunization](/wiki/Passive_immunization \"Passive immunization\"). These\nantibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of\nenveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is\nactivated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide\n[galactose](/wiki/Galactose \"Galactose\") α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is\nfound as a terminal sugar on [glycosylated](/wiki/Glycosylation\n\"Glycosylation\") cell surface proteins, and generated in response to\nproduction of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut.[32] Rejection\nof [xenotransplantated organs](/wiki/Organ_xenotransplantation \"Organ\nxenotransplantation\") is thought to be, in part, the result of natural\nantibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens\nexpressed on the donor tissue.[33]\n\n## Immunoglobulin\ndiversity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Immunoglobulin diversity\")]\n\nVirtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response. Successful\nrecognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires\ndiversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them\nto interact with many different antigens.[34] It has been estimated that\nhumans generate about 10 billion different antibodies, each capable of binding\na distinct epitope of an antigen.[35] Although a huge repertoire of different\nantibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of\n[genes](/wiki/Gene \"Gene\") available to make these proteins is limited by the\nsize of the human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that\nallow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a\nrelatively small number of antibody genes.[36]\n\n### Domain\nvariability[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Domain variability\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Complementarity_determining_regions.PNG/250px-\nComplementarity_determining_regions.PNG)](/wiki/File:Complementarity_determining_regions.PNG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Complementarity_determining_regions.PNG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe complementarity determining regions of the heavy chain are shown in red\n([PDB](/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank \"Protein Data Bank\"):\n[1IGT](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1IGT)​)\n\nThe chromosomal region that encodes an antibody is large and contains several\ndistinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region\ncontaining heavy chain genes ([IGH@](/wiki/IGH@ \"IGH@\")) is found on\n[chromosome 14](/wiki/Chromosome_14 \"Chromosome 14\"), and the loci containing\nlambda and kappa light chain genes ([IGL@](/wiki/IGL@ \"IGL@\") and\n[IGK@](/wiki/IGK@ \"IGK@\")) are found on chromosomes [22](/wiki/Chromosome_22\n\"Chromosome 22\") and [2](/wiki/Chromosome_2 \"Chromosome 2\") in humans. One of\nthese domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy\nand light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies\ngenerated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains,\nare located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and\nHV-3) or [complementarity determining\nregions](/wiki/Complementarity_determining_region \"Complementarity determining\nregion\") (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains\nby conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65\ndifferent variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these\ngenes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a\nlarge cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability. This\ncombination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.[37]\n\n### V(D)J\nrecombination[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: V\\(D\\)J recombination\")]\n\nFor more details on this topic, see [V(D)J\nrecombination](/wiki/V\\(D\\)J_recombination \"V\\(D\\)J recombination\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/VDJ_recombination.png/250px-\nVDJ_recombination.png)](/wiki/File:VDJ_recombination.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:VDJ_recombination.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSimplified overview of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin heavy chains\n\nSomatic recombination of immunoglobulins, also known as _V(D)J recombination_\n, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The\nvariable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in\nseveral pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called\nvariable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments.[36] V, D and J segments\nare found in [Ig heavy chains](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_heavy_chain\n\"Immunoglobulin heavy chain\"), but only V and J segments are found in [Ig\nlight chains](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain \"Immunoglobulin light chain\").\nMultiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly\narranged in the [genomes](/wiki/Genome \"Genome\") of [mammals](/wiki/Mammal\n\"Mammal\"). In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an\nimmunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one\nD and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As\nthere are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different\ncombinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin\nvariable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with\ndifferent [paratopes](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paratope\n\"wikt:paratope\"), and thus different antigen specificities.[8] Interestingly,\nthe rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain\nimmunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which\nfurther influences biology of B-cells.[38]\n\nRAG proteins play an important role with V(D)J recombination in cutting DNA at\na particular region.[39] Without the presence of these proteins, V(D)J\nrecombination would not occur.[39]\n\nAfter a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J\nrecombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as\n[allelic exclusion](/wiki/Allelic_exclusion \"Allelic exclusion\")) thus each B\ncell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.[2][40]\n\n### Somatic hypermutation and affinity\nmaturation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: Somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation\")]\n\nFurther information: [Somatic hypermutation](/wiki/Somatic_hypermutation\n\"Somatic hypermutation\") and [Affinity maturation](/wiki/Affinity_maturation\n\"Affinity maturation\")\n\nFollowing activation with antigen, B cells begin to\n[proliferate](/wiki/Cell_division \"Cell division\") rapidly. In these rapidly\ndividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light\nchains undergo a high rate of [point mutation](/wiki/Point_mutation \"Point\nmutation\"), by a process called _somatic hypermutation_ (SHM). SHM results in\napproximately one [nucleotide](/wiki/Nucleotide \"Nucleotide\") change per\nvariable gene, per cell division.[10] As a consequence, any daughter B cells\nwill acquire slight [amino acid](/wiki/Amino_acid \"Amino acid\") differences in\nthe variable domains of their antibody chains.\n\nThis serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the\nantibody's antigen-binding [affinity](/wiki/Chemical_affinity \"Chemical\naffinity\").[41] Some point mutations will result in the production of\nantibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen\nthan the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a\nstronger interaction (high affinity).[42] B cells that express high affinity\nantibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during\ninteractions with other cells, whereas those with low affinity antibodies will\nnot, and will die by [apoptosis](/wiki/Apoptosis \"Apoptosis\").[42] Thus, B\ncells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will\noutcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the\naverage affinity of antibodies to increase over time. The process of\ngenerating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called _affinity\nmaturation_. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J\nrecombination, and is dependent on help from [helper T\ncells](/wiki/Helper_T_cell \"Helper T cell\").[43]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Class_switch_recombination.png/250px-\nClass_switch_recombination.png)](/wiki/File:Class_switch_recombination.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Class_switch_recombination.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nMechanism of class switch recombination that allows isotype switching in\nactivated B cells\n\n### Class switching[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Class switching\")]\n\n[Isotype or class switching](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_class_switching\n\"Immunoglobulin class switching\") is a [biological\nprocess](/wiki/Biological_process \"Biological process\") occurring after\nactivation of the B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes\nof antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG).[8] The different classes of antibody, and thus\neffector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the\nimmunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface\nIgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted\nfor a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG,\nIgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an\nantigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same\nactivated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the\nconstant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching;\nthe variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged.\nThus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for\nthe same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function\nappropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by\ncytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the\nB cell environment.[44]\n\nClass switching occurs in the heavy chain gene\n[locus](/wiki/Locus_\\(genetics\\) \"Locus \\(genetics\\)\") by a mechanism called\nclass switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved\n[nucleotide](/wiki/Nucleotide \"Nucleotide\") motifs, called _switch (S)\nregions_ , found in [DNA](/wiki/DNA \"DNA\") upstream of each constant region\ngene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity of a\nseries of [enzymes](/wiki/Enzyme \"Enzyme\") at two selected S-regions.[45][46]\nThe variable domain [exon](/wiki/Exon \"Exon\") is rejoined through a process\ncalled [non-homologous end joining](/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining \"Non-\nhomologous end joining\") (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε).\nThis process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a\ndifferent isotype.[47]\n\n### Affinity\ndesignations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit\nsection: Affinity designations\")]\n\nA group of antibodies can be called _monovalent_ (or _specific_) if they have\naffinity for the same epitope,[48] or for the same antigen[49] (but\npotentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of\nmicroorganism[49] (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In\ncontrast, a group of antibodies can be called _polyvalent_ (or _unspecific_)\nif they have affinity for various antigens[50] or microorganisms.[50]\n[Intravenous immunoglobulin](/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin \"Intravenous\nimmunoglobulin\"), if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In\ncontrast, [monoclonal antibodies](/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies \"Monoclonal\nantibodies\") are monovalent for the same epitope.\n\n### Asymmetrical\nantibodies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: Asymmetrical antibodies\")]\n\nHeterodimeric antibodies, which are also asymmetrical and antibodies, allow\nfor greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to\nthe antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is\nthe “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part\nof the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by\nreplacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which\nis engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What\nconnects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each\nchain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell\nmediated cytotoxicity. [Single chain variable fragments](/wiki/Single-\nchain_variable_fragment \"Single-chain variable fragment\") ([scFv](/wiki/ScFv\n\"ScFv\")) are connected to the variable domain of the heavy and light chain via\na short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more\nflexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different\nscFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant\ndomain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain.[51] This\ngives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of\ntwo different antigens.[52] The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer\nformation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.\n\nTo further improve the function of heterodimeric antibodies, many scientists\nare looking towards artificial constructs. Artificial antibodies are largely\ndiverse protein motifs that use the functional strategy of the antibody\nmolecule, but aren’t limited by the loop and framework structural constraints\nof the natural antibody.[53] Being able to control the combinational design of\nthe sequence and three-dimensional space could transcend the natural design\nand allow for the attachment of different combinations of drugs to the arms.\n\nHeterodimeric antibodies have a greater range in shapes they can take and the\ndrugs that are attached to the arms don’t have to be the same on each arm,\nallowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment.\nPharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even\nmultispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive\ngiven that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased\nfunctionality.\n\n## Medical\napplications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit\nsection: Medical applications\")]\n\n### Disease\ndiagnosis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit\nsection: Disease diagnosis\")]\n\nDetection of particular antibodies is a very common form of medical\n[diagnostics](/wiki/Medical_diagnosis \"Medical diagnosis\"), and applications\nsuch as [serology](/wiki/Serology \"Serology\") depend on these methods.[54] For\nexample, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis,[55] a\n[titer](/wiki/Titer \"Titer\") of antibodies directed against [Epstein-Barr\nvirus](/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus \"Epstein-Barr virus\") or [Lyme\ndisease](/wiki/Lyme_disease \"Lyme disease\") is estimated from the blood. If\nthose antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected or the\ninfection occurred a _very_ long time ago, and the B cells generating these\nspecific antibodies have naturally decayed.\n\nIn [clinical immunology](/wiki/Clinical_immunology \"Clinical immunology\"),\nlevels of individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by\n[nephelometry](/wiki/Nephelometry \"Nephelometry\") (or turbidimetry) to\ncharacterize the antibody profile of patient.[56] Elevations in different\nclasses of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of\n[liver](/wiki/Liver \"Liver\") damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is\nunclear.[1] For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic\n[cirrhosis](/wiki/Cirrhosis \"Cirrhosis\"), elevated IgM indicates [viral\nhepatitis](/wiki/Viral_hepatitis \"Viral hepatitis\") and [primary biliary\ncirrhosis](/wiki/Primary_biliary_cirrhosis \"Primary biliary cirrhosis\"), while\nIgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, [autoimmune\nhepatitis](/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis \"Autoimmune hepatitis\") and cirrhosis.\n\n[Autoimmune disorders](/wiki/Autoimmune_disorder \"Autoimmune disorder\") can\noften be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own\n[epitopes](/wiki/Epitope \"Epitope\"); many can be detected through [blood\ntests](/wiki/Blood_test \"Blood test\").

Treatment of a\nmother with Anti-RhD antibodies prior to and immediately after trauma and\ndelivery destroys Rh antigen in the mother's system from the fetus. It is\nimportant to note that this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B\ncells to \"remember\" Rh antigen by generating memory B cells. Therefore, her\nhumoral immune system will not make anti-Rh antibodies, and will not attack\nthe Rh antigens of the current or subsequent babies. Rho(D) Immune Globulin\ntreatment prevents sensitization that can lead to [Rh\ndisease](/wiki/Rh_disease \"Rh disease\"), but does not prevent or treat the\nunderlying disease itself.[67]\n\n## Research\napplications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit\nsection: Research applications\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/FluorescentCells.jpg/200px-\nFluorescentCells.jpg)](/wiki/File:FluorescentCells.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FluorescentCells.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Immunofluorescence](/wiki/Immunofluorescence \"Immunofluorescence\") image of\nthe eukaryotic [cytoskeleton](/wiki/Cytoskeleton \"Cytoskeleton\").\n[Microtubules](/wiki/Microtubule \"Microtubule\") as shown in green, are marked\nby an antibody conjugated to a green fluorescing molecule,\n[FITC](/wiki/Fluorescein_isothiocyanate \"Fluorescein isothiocyanate\").\n\nSpecific antibodies are produced by injecting an [antigen](/wiki/Antigen\n\"Antigen\") into a [mammal](/wiki/Mammal \"Mammal\"), such as a\n[mouse](/wiki/Mouse \"Mouse\"), [rat](/wiki/Rat \"Rat\"), [rabbit](/wiki/Rabbit\n\"Rabbit\"), [goat](/wiki/Goat \"Goat\"), [sheep](/wiki/Sheep \"Sheep\"), or\n[horse](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\") for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated\nfrom these animals contains _[polyclonal\nantibodies](/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies \"Polyclonal antibodies\")_ —multiple\nantibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the [serum](/wiki/Blood_plasma\n\"Blood plasma\"), which can now be called [antiserum](/wiki/Antiserum\n\"Antiserum\"). Antigens are also injected into [chickens](/wiki/Chicken\n\"Chicken\") for generation of polyclonal antibodies in [egg\nyolk](/wiki/Egg_yolk \"Egg yolk\").[68] To obtain antibody that is specific for\na single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting\n[lymphocytes](/wiki/Lymphocyte \"Lymphocyte\") are isolated from the animal and\n[immortalized](/wiki/Biological_immortality \"Biological immortality\") by\nfusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called\n[hybridomas](/wiki/Hybridoma \"Hybridoma\"), and will continually grow and\nsecrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by [dilution\ncloning](/wiki/Dilution_cloning \"Dilution cloning\") to generate [cell\nclones](/wiki/Cloning#Cellular_cloning \"Cloning\") that all produce the same\nantibody; these antibodies are called _[monoclonal\nantibodies](/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies \"Monoclonal antibodies\")_.[69]\nPolyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using [Protein\nA/G](/wiki/Protein_A/G \"Protein A/G\") or [antigen-affinity\nchromatography](/wiki/Affinity_chromatography \"Affinity chromatography\").[70]\n\nIn research, purified antibodies are used in many applications. Antibodies for\nresearch applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or\nthrough use of a specialist search engine. Research antibodies are most\ncommonly used to identify and locate [intracellular](/wiki/Intracellular\n\"Intracellular\") and [extracellular](/wiki/Extracellular \"Extracellular\")\nproteins. Antibodies are used in [flow cytometry](/wiki/Flow_cytometry \"Flow\ncytometry\") to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express;\ndifferent types of cell express different combinations of [cluster of\ndifferentiation](/wiki/Cluster_of_differentiation \"Cluster of\ndifferentiation\") molecules on their surface, and produce different\nintracellular and secretable proteins.[71] They are also used in\n[immunoprecipitation](/wiki/Immunoprecipitation \"Immunoprecipitation\") to\nseparate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from\nother molecules in a [cell lysate](/wiki/Cell_lysate \"Cell lysate\"),[72] in\n[Western blot](/wiki/Western_blot \"Western blot\") analyses to identify\nproteins separated by [electrophoresis](/wiki/Electrophoresis\n\"Electrophoresis\"),[73] and in\n[immunohistochemistry](/wiki/Immunohistochemistry \"Immunohistochemistry\") or\n[immunofluorescence](/wiki/Immunofluorescence \"Immunofluorescence\") to examine\nprotein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells with\nthe assistance of a [microscope](/wiki/Microscope \"Microscope\").[71][74]\nProteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies, using\n[ELISA](/wiki/ELISA \"ELISA\") and [ELISPOT](/wiki/ELISPOT \"ELISPOT\")\ntechniques.[75][76]\n\nAntibodies used in research are some of the most powerful, yet most\nproblematic reagents with a tremendous number of factors that must be\ncontrolled in any experiment including cross reactivity, or the antibody\nrecognizing multiple epitopes and affinity, which can vary widely depending on\nexperimental conditions such as pH, solvent, state of tissue etc. Multiple\nattempts have been made to improve both the way that researchers validate\nantibodies[77][78] and ways in which they report on antibodies. Researchers\nusing antibodies in their work need to record them correctly in order to allow\ntheir research to be reproducible (and therefore tested, and qualified by\nother researchers). Less than half of research antibodies referenced in\nacademic papers can be easily identified.[79] Papers published in\n[F1000](/wiki/F1000 \"F1000\") in 2014 and 2015 provide researchers with a guide\nfor reporting research antibody use.[80][81] The RRID paper, is co-published\nin 4 journals that implemented the [RRIDs](/wiki/RRIDs \"RRIDs\") Standard for\nresearch resource citation, which draws data from the antibodyregistry.org as\nthe source of antibody identifiers[82] (see also group at Force11[83])\n\n## Regulations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit\nsection: Regulations\")]\n\n### Production and\ntesting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit\nsection: Production and testing\")]\n\nTraditionally, most antibodies are produced by hybridoma\n[cell](/wiki/Cell_\\(biology\\) \"Cell \\(biology\\)\") lines through\nimmortalization of antibody-producing cells by chemically-induced fusion with\nmyeloma cells.

This information is used for [protein\nengineering](/wiki/Protein_engineering \"Protein engineering\"), modifying the\nantigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody.\n[X-ray crystallography](/wiki/X-ray_crystallography \"X-ray crystallography\")\nis one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However,\ncrystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming. Computational\napproaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but\ntheir results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical\nstructures. Online web servers such as _Web Antibody Modeling_ (WAM)[84] and\n_Prediction of Immunoglobulin Structure_ (PIGS)[85] enables computational\nmodeling of antibody variable regions. Rosetta Antibody is a novel antibody FV\nregion structure prediction [server](/wiki/Server_\\(computing\\) \"Server\n\\(computing\\)\"), which incorporates sophisticated techniques to minimize CDR\nloops and optimize the relative orientation of the light and heavy chains, as\nwell as [homology](/wiki/Homology_\\(biology\\) \"Homology \\(biology\\)\") models\nthat predict successful docking of antibodies with their unique antigen.[86]\n\nThe ability to describe the antibody through binding affinity to the antigen\nis supplemented by information on antibody structure and amino acid sequences\nfor the purpose of patent claims.[87]\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=30 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nSee also: [History of immunology](/wiki/History_of_immunology \"History of\nimmunology\")\n\nThe first use of the term \"antibody\" occurred in a text by [Paul\nEhrlich](/wiki/Paul_Ehrlich \"Paul Ehrlich\"). The term _Antikörper_ (the German\nword for _antibody_) appears in the conclusion of his article \"Experimental\nStudies on Immunity\", published in October 1891, which states that, \"if two\nsubstances give rise to two different antikörper, then they themselves must be\ndifferent\".[88] However, the term was not accepted immediately and several\nother terms for antibody were proposed; these included _Immunkörper_ ,\n_Amboceptor_ , _Zwischenkörper_ , _substance sensibilisatrice_ , _copula_ ,\n_Desmon_ , _philocytase_ , _fixateur_ , and _Immunisin_.[88] The word\n_antibody_ has formal analogy to the word _[antitoxin](/wiki/Antitoxin\n\"Antitoxin\")_ and a similar concept to _Immunkörper_ (_immune body_ in\nEnglish).[88] As such, the original construction of the word contains a\nlogical flaw; the antitoxin is something directed against a toxin, while the\nantibody is a body directed against something.[88]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/AngeloftheWest.jpg/250px-\nAngeloftheWest.jpg)](/wiki/File:AngeloftheWest.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AngeloftheWest.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[Angel of the West](/wiki/Angel_of_the_West \"Angel of the West\")_ (2008) by\n[Julian Voss-Andreae](/wiki/Julian_Voss-Andreae \"Julian Voss-Andreae\") is a\nsculpture based on the antibody structure published by E. Padlan.[89] Created\nfor the Florida campus of [the Scripps Research\nInstitute](/wiki/The_Scripps_Research_Institute \"The Scripps Research\nInstitute\"),[90] the antibody is placed into a ring referencing [Leonardo da\nVinci's](/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci \"Leonardo da Vinci\") _[Vitruvian\nMan](/wiki/Vitruvian_Man \"Vitruvian Man\")_ thus highlighting the similarity of\nthe antibody and the human body.[91]\n\nThe study of antibodies began in 1890 when [Kitasato\nShibasaburō](/wiki/Kitasato_Shibasabur%C5%8D \"Kitasato Shibasaburō\") described\nantibody activity against [diphtheria](/wiki/Diphtheria \"Diphtheria\") and\n[tetanus toxins](/wiki/Tetanus_toxin \"Tetanus toxin\"). Kitasato put forward\nthe theory of [humoral immunity](/wiki/Humoral_immunity \"Humoral immunity\"),\nproposing that a mediator in serum could react with a foreign antigen.[92][93]\nHis idea prompted Paul Ehrlich to propose the [side-chain theory](/wiki/Side-\nchain_theory \"Side-chain theory\") for antibody and antigen interaction in\n1897, when he hypothesized that receptors (described as \"side-chains\") on the\nsurface of cells could bind specifically to [toxins](/wiki/Toxin \"Toxin\") – in\na \"lock-and-key\" interaction – and that this binding reaction is the trigger\nfor the production of antibodies.[94] Other researchers believed that\nantibodies existed freely in the blood and, in 1904, [Almroth\nWright](/wiki/Almroth_Wright \"Almroth Wright\") suggested that soluble\nantibodies coated [bacteria](/wiki/Bacteria \"Bacteria\") to label them for\n[phagocytosis](/wiki/Phagocytosis \"Phagocytosis\") and killing; a process that\nhe named [opsoninization](/wiki/Opsonin \"Opsonin\").[95]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Michael_Heidelberger_1954.jpg/200px-\nMichael_Heidelberger_1954.jpg)](/wiki/File:Michael_Heidelberger_1954.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Michael_Heidelberger_1954.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMichael Heidelberger\n\nIn the 1920s, [Michael Heidelberger](/wiki/Michael_Heidelberger \"Michael\nHeidelberger\") and [Oswald Avery](/wiki/Oswald_Avery \"Oswald Avery\") observed\nthat antigens could be precipitated by antibodies and went on to show that\nantibodies are made of protein.[96] The biochemical properties of antigen-\nantibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s\nby [John Marrack](/wiki/John_Marrack \"John Marrack\").[97] The next major\nadvance was in the 1940s, when [Linus Pauling](/wiki/Linus_Pauling \"Linus\nPauling\") confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing\nthat the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their\nshape than their chemical composition.[98] In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered\nthat B cells, in the form of [plasma cells](/wiki/Plasma_cell \"Plasma cell\"),\nwere responsible for generating antibodies.[99]\n\nFurther work concentrated on characterizing the structures of the antibody\nproteins. A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the\nearly 1960s by [Gerald Edelman](/wiki/Gerald_Edelman \"Gerald Edelman\") and\nJoseph Gally of the antibody [light chain](/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain\n\"Immunoglobulin light chain\"),[100] and their realization that this protein is\nthe same as the [Bence-Jones protein](/wiki/Bence-Jones_protein \"Bence-Jones\nprotein\") described in 1845 by [Henry Bence Jones](/wiki/Henry_Bence_Jones\n\"Henry Bence Jones\").[101] Edelman went on to discover that antibodies are\ncomposed of [disulfide bond](/wiki/Disulfide_bond \"Disulfide bond\")-linked\nheavy and light chains. Around the same time, antibody-binding (Fab) and\nantibody tail (Fc) regions of IgG were characterized by [Rodney\nPorter](/wiki/Rodney_Porter \"Rodney Porter\").[102] Together, these scientists\ndeduced the structure and complete [amino acid](/wiki/Amino_acid \"Amino acid\")\nsequence of IgG, a feat for which they were jointly awarded the 1972 [Nobel\nPrize in Physiology or Medicine](/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine\n\"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\").[102] The Fv fragment was prepared\nand characterized by David Givol.[103] While most of these early studies\nfocused on IgM and IgG, other immunoglobulin isotypes were identified in the\n1960s: Thomas Tomasi discovered secretory antibody ([IgA](/wiki/IgA\n\"IgA\"));[104] David S. Rowe and John L. Fahey discovered IgD;[105] and\n[Kimishige Ishizaka](/wiki/Kimishige_Ishizaka \"Kimishige Ishizaka\") and Teruko\nIshizaka discovered [IgE](/wiki/IgE \"IgE\") and showed it was a class of\nantibodies involved in allergic reactions.[106] In a landmark series of\nexperiments beginning in 1976, [Susumu Tonegawa](/wiki/Susumu_Tonegawa \"Susumu\nTonegawa\") showed that genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast\narray of available antibodies.[107]\n\n## Antibody mimetic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Antibody mimetic\")]\n\n[Antibody mimetics](/wiki/Antibody_mimetic \"Antibody mimetic\") are organic\ncompounds that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens. They are\nusually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20\nkDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody\nmimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion\nproteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better\nsolubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and\ncomparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics such as the\n[Affimer](/wiki/Affimer \"Affimer\") and the [DARPin](/wiki/DARPin \"DARPin\")\nhave being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and\ntherapeutic agents.[108]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Affimer](/wiki/Affimer \"Affimer\")\n  * [Antibody mimetic](/wiki/Antibody_mimetic \"Antibody mimetic\")\n  * [Anti-mitochondrial antibodies](/wiki/Anti-mitochondrial_antibodies \"Anti-mitochondrial antibodies\")\n  * [Anti-nuclear antibodies](/wiki/Anti-nuclear_antibodies \"Anti-nuclear antibodies\")\n  * [Aptamer](/wiki/Aptamer \"Aptamer\")\n  * [Colostrum](/wiki/Colostrum \"Colostrum\")\n  * [ELISA](/wiki/ELISA \"ELISA\")\n  * [Humoral immunity](/wiki/Humoral_immunity \"Humoral immunity\")\n  * [Immunology](/wiki/Immunology \"Immunology\")\n  * [Immunosuppressive drug](/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug \"Immunosuppressive drug\")\n  * [Intravenous immunoglobulin](/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin \"Intravenous immunoglobulin\") (IVIg)\n  * [Magnetic immunoassay](/wiki/Magnetic_immunoassay \"Magnetic immunoassay\")\n  * [Microantibody](/wiki/Microantibody \"Microantibody\")\n  * [Monoclonal antibody](/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody \"Monoclonal antibody\")\n  * [Neutralizing antibody](/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody \"Neutralizing antibody\")\n  * [Secondary antibodies](/wiki/Secondary_antibodies \"Secondary antibodies\")\n  * [Single-domain antibody](/wiki/Single-domain_antibody \"Single-domain antibody\")\n  * [Slope spectroscopy](/wiki/Slope_spectroscopy \"Slope spectroscopy\")\n  * [Western blot normalization](/wiki/Western_blot_normalization \"Western blot normalization\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antibody&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ Rhoades RA, Pflanzer RG (2002). _Human Physiology_ (4th ed.).
