The children heavily featured in the films are the\nPevensie siblings, and a prominent antagonist is the [White\nWitch](/wiki/White_Witch \"White Witch\") (also known as Jadis).\n\nThe first two films were directed by [Andrew Adamson](/wiki/Andrew_Adamson\n\"Andrew Adamson\") and the third film was directed by [Michael\nApted](/wiki/Michael_Apted \"Michael Apted\").

S. Lewis never sold the film rights to the _Narnia_ series during his\nlifetime, as he was skeptical that any cinematic adaptation could render the\nmore fantastical elements and characters of the story realistically.[a] Only\nafter seeing a demo reel of [CGI](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-\ngenerated imagery\") animals did [Douglas Gresham](/wiki/Douglas_Gresham\n\"Douglas Gresham\") (Lewis's stepson and [literary\nexecutor](/wiki/Literary_executor \"Literary executor\"), and film co-producer)\ngive approval for a film adaptation.\n\nAlthough the plan was originally to produce the films in the same order as the\nbook series' original publication, it was reported that _[The Magician's\nNephew](/wiki/The_Magician%27s_Nephew \"The Magician's Nephew\")_, which\nrecounts the creation of Narnia, would be the fourth feature film in the\nseries, instead of _[The Silver Chair](/wiki/The_Silver_Chair \"The Silver\nChair\")_. It was rumoured that _The Magician 's Nephew_ was chosen as an\nattempt to reboot the series, after the release of _The Voyage of the Dawn\nTreader_ grossed less when compared to the two previous films.[1] In March\n2011, Walden Media confirmed that they intended _The Magician 's Nephew_ to be\nnext in the series, but stressed that it was not yet in development.[2]\n\nIn October 2011, Douglas Gresham stated that Walden Media's contract with the\nC. S. Lewis estate had expired, hinting that Walden Media's lapse in\nrenegotiating their contract with the C. S. Lewis estate was due to internal\nconflicts between both companies about the direction of future films.[3]\n\nOn 1 October 2013, The C. S. Lewis Company announced a partnership with [The\nMark Gordon Company](/wiki/The_Mark_Gordon_Company \"The Mark Gordon Company\"),\nand that _The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair_ was officially in pre-\nproduction.[4]\n\n##\nFilms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_\\(film_series\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Films\")]\n\n### _The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe_\n(2005)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_\\(film_series\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe \\(2005\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the\nWardrobe](/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia:_The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe\n\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\")\n\n[_The Lion, the Witch and the\nWardrobe_](/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia:_The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe\n\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\"), based on\nthe [novel of the same title](/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe \"The\nLion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\"), is the first film in the series.
