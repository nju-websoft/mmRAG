The club was formed in [Woolwich](/wiki/Woolwich \"Woolwich\") in 1886\nas Dial Square before being renamed as Royal Arsenal, and then Woolwich\nArsenal in 1893.[1] In 1914, the club's name was shortened to Arsenal F.C.\nafter moving to [Highbury](/wiki/Arsenal_Stadium \"Arsenal Stadium\") a year\nearlier.[2] After spending their first four seasons solely participating in\ncup tournaments and [friendlies](/wiki/Friendly_match#Association_football\n\"Friendly match\"), Arsenal became the first southern member admitted into [the\nFootball League](/wiki/The_Football_League \"The Football League\") in 1893.[3]\nIn spite of finishing fifth in the [Second\nDivision](/wiki/Football_League_Second_Division \"Football League Second\nDivision\") in 1919, the club was voted to rejoin the [First\nDivision](/wiki/Football_League_First_Division \"Football League First\nDivision\") at the expense of local rivals [Tottenham\nHotspur](/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C. \"Tottenham Hotspur F.C.\").[4] Since that\ntime, they have not fallen below the first tier of the [English football\nleague system](/wiki/English_football_league_system \"English football league\nsystem\") and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top\nflight.[5] The club remained in the Football League until 1992, when its First\nDivision was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed\n[Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League \"Premier League\"), of which they were an\ninaugural member.[6]\n\nThe list encompasses the honours won by Arsenal at national, regional, county\nand friendly level, records set by the club, their managers and their players.\nThe player records section itemises the club's leading goalscorers and those\nwho have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records\nnotable achievements by Arsenal players on the international stage, and the\nhighest transfer fees paid and received by the club.

The\n[Kent Junior\nCup](/wiki/Kent_County_Football_Association#County_Cup_Competitions \"Kent\nCounty Football Association\"), won by Royal Arsenal's reserves, was the club's\nfirst trophy, while the

[2003–04](/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_in_English_football\n\"2003–04 in English football\"), Arsenal recorded an unbeaten top-flight league\nseason, something achieved only once before by [Preston
