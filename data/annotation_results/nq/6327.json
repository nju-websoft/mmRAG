                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not explicitly define a 'unit cube', but it provides an example of a cube with side 1 cm.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Yes, the document offers an example of a cube with sides of 1 cm, which helps infer the concept of a 'unit cube' with side 1 unit.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "1",
                "Explanation": "The document does not directly define a 'unit cube', but it provides context through the example of a cubic centimetre, implicitly suggesting what a unit cube with side length 1 unit could be. Thus, it is partially relevant, as it provides contextual information that helps understand the concept of a unit cube."
