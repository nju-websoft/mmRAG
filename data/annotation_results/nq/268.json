T. Barnum](/wiki/P._T._Barnum \"P. T. Barnum\")\nand his troupe perform a show at the circus (\"The Greatest Show\"). In a\nflashback to Barnum's childhood where he and his father Philo, a tailor, work\nfor the Hallett family, he becomes infatuated with their daughter, Charity.\nThough Charity is being sent to [finishing school](/wiki/Finishing_school\n\"Finishing school\"), Barnum reassures her they will not be separated. The two\nkeep in touch through letters until they meet again in adulthood (\"A Million\nDreams\"), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen,\nin New York City (\"A Million Dreams\" reprise). They live a humble life; though\nCharity is happy, Barnum dreams of more.\n\nBarnum loses his job as a clerk at a shipping company after the company goes\nbankrupt. Taking a risky bet, he takes out a large loan from a bank, deceiving\nthe bank into accepting his former employer's lost ships as collateral. He\nuses this loan to buy [Barnum's American\nMuseum](/wiki/Barnum%27s_American_Museum \"Barnum's American Museum\") in\ndowntown Manhattan, an attraction showcasing various wax models. Initially,\nsales are slow; on the suggestion of his children to showcase something\n\"alive\", Barnum searches for \"freaks\" to serve as performers for his museum\n(\"Come Alive\"). This attracts a large audience despite protests and poor\nreviews, prompting Barnum to rename his venture \"Barnum's Circus.\"\n\nSearching for ways to further his reputation amongst the upper class, Barnum\nmeets playwright Phillip Carlyle and convinces him to join his venture (\"The\nOther Side\"). Carlyle is enchanted with Anne Wheeler, an African-American\ntrapeze artist, but he hides his feelings. During a trip, Carlyle arranges for\nBarnum and his troupe to meet [Queen Victoria](/wiki/Queen_Victoria \"Queen\nVictoria\"). Afterwards, Barnum meets [Jenny Lind](/wiki/Jenny_Lind \"Jenny\nLind\"), a famed Swedish singer, whom he convinces to perform in America, with\nhim serving as her manager. Lind's first American performance is a rousing\nsuccess (\"Never Enough\"). While Barnum gains favor with the aristocratic\npatrons, he begins to distance himself from his original troupe, refusing to\nsocialize with them. Dejected, they decide to stand against their local\nharassers (\"This Is Me\").\n\nCarlyle and Wheeler attend the theater together one night, only to run into\nCarlyle's parents, who are blatantly racist toward Wheeler, causing her to\nleave. Carlyle chases her and tries to convince her that they can be together,\nbut she rejects him despite her feelings towards him (\"Rewrite the Stars\"). As\nBarnum takes Lind on a US tour, Charity feels isolated from her husband as she\nstays home with their daughters (\"Tightrope\"). While on tour, Lind begins\nfalling in love with Barnum, but when he refuses her advances, she calls off\nthe tour and kisses him at the end of her last show, which is photographed by\nthe press (\"Never Enough\" reprise). Barnum returns home to find his circus on\nfire, caused by a fight between the protesters and the troupe. Carlyle, who\nhad tried to save Anne not knowing she had already escaped, is rescued by\nBarnum amid the chaos but suffers severe burns. Most of the sets and props are\ndestroyed. Word of Lind's cancellation and Barnum's public intimacy also\nreaches New York, resulting in his mansion being foreclosed upon and Charity\ntaking Caroline and Helen to her parents' home.\n\nDepressed, Barnum retreats to a local bar, where his troupe find him there and\nexplain that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a\nfamily that needs him. An inspired Barnum resolves to start anew and not let\nambition overtake his loved ones anymore. Meanwhile, the injured Carlyle wakes\nin a hospital with Anne by his side and they share a kiss (\"From Now On\").\n\nBarnum leaves and finds his estranged wife, and they decide to mend their\nrelationship. Faced with the financial difficulty of rebuilding the circus,\nthe recovering Carlyle steps in, offering to use his earnings from his share\nof the circus's profits to rebuild it under the condition of becoming\npartners, which Barnum happily accepts. As rebuilding the circus in its\noriginal location would be too expensive, Barnum rebuilds it as an open-air\ntent circus by the docks. The revamped circus is a huge success, and Barnum\ngives full control of the show to Carlyle so he can focus on his family (\"The\nGreatest Show\" reprise).\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Greatest_Showman&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Hugh Jackman](/wiki/Hugh_Jackman \"Hugh Jackman\") as [P.
