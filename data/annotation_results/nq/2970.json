It is so fast-paced and basically it\nallows me to learn a lot about the industry.\"[2] Hemsworth appeared for three\nand a half years on _Home and Away_ , before leaving in 2007 to focus on his\nfilm career.[3][4] Hemsworth returned to the set of _Home and Away_ in\nNovember 2014 to film a scene in the [Pier Diner](/wiki/Summer_Bay#Pier_Diner\n\"Summer Bay\"), as an [extra](/wiki/Extra_\\(acting\\) \"Extra \\(acting\\)\") and\nnot as his character Kim Hyde, in which he was seen at a table in the\nbackground, wearing a black baseball cap.[5][6] He appeared in the episode\nbroadcast on 19 May 2015.[6]\n\n## Storylines[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kim_Hyde&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Storylines\")]\n\nKim arrives in Summer Bay after his father, Barry ([Ivar\nKants](/wiki/Ivar_Kants \"Ivar Kants\")) is appointed principal of Summer Bay\nHigh at the start of the school year. It is clear the two do not get along and\nalready had previous issues when Barry taught at Kim's previous school. He\nquickly befriends Robbie and embarrasses him in front of his girlfriend Tasha\nAndrews ([Isabel Lucas](/wiki/Isabel_Lucas \"Isabel Lucas\")) when he questions\nRobbie's virginity. The moment is interrupted when the three witness [Noah\nLawson](/wiki/Noah_Lawson \"Noah Lawson\") ([Beau Brady](/wiki/Beau_Brady \"Beau\nBrady\")) [wipe out](/wiki/Wipe_out_\\(surfing\\) \"Wipe out \\(surfing\\)\") while\nsurfing. Kim dives into the sea and saves Noah. Robbie and Tasha are impressed\nwith his heroics and suggest he join a swimming team, which Kim declines\nhaving previously been on one. Kim and Barry's relationship becomes more and\nmore strained to the point where Kim moves in with Tasha and [Irene\nRoberts](/wiki/Irene_Roberts \"Irene Roberts\"). His ex, Brooke McPherson\n([Alyssa McClelland](/wiki/Alyssa_McClelland \"Alyssa McClelland\")) returns,\ntelling him he is the father of her son Charlie. Kim is furious when realises\nBarry knew about the child but grows to love Charlie. The truth is revealed\nthat Charlie is not his son and Brooke leaves, with Kim and Barry's\nrelationship no better than before. He then drops out of school and begins\nworking at the gym after Tasha buys him a share much to his father's chagrin.\nHe re-enrolls after Noah's death and participates in a memorial concert.\n\n[Matilda Hunter](/wiki/Matilda_Hunter \"Matilda Hunter\") ([Indiana\nEvans](/wiki/Indiana_Evans \"Indiana Evans\")) takes an interest in Kim and\nfeigns drowning to get his attention only for it to backfire and end up\nstruggling for real. However, she is rescued. Matilda overhears Kim talking to\nRobbie and saying he will ask out his sister. However, Kim means Robbie and\nMatilda's older sister, [Kit](/wiki/Kit_Hunter \"Kit Hunter\") ([Amy\nMizzi](/wiki/Amy_Mizzi \"Amy Mizzi\")). Kim and Kit begin a relationship before\nshe heads to Paris. Kim gets his driver's license and takes a camping trip\nwith Robbie and Tasha. Robbie steps on a needle and fears he has contracted\nHIV. Kim supports him, but their friendship becomes somewhat strained when\nRobbie's behaviour becomes erratic. During this time, Kim becomes close to\nNoah's widow, [Hayley](/wiki/Hayley_Smith_\\(Home_and_Away\\) \"Hayley Smith\n\\(Home and Away\\)\") ([Bec Cartwright](/wiki/Bec_Cartwright \"Bec Cartwright\");\n[Ella Scott Lynch](/wiki/Ella_Scott_Lynch \"Ella Scott Lynch\")) and they have a\nbrief fling which ends.\n\nKim dates [Eve Jacobsen](/wiki/Eve_Jacobsen \"Eve Jacobsen\") ([Emily\nPerry](/wiki/Emily_Perry_\\(Australian_actress\\) \"Emily Perry \\(Australian\nactress\\)\")), who is using the identity of [Zoe\nMcCallister](/wiki/Zoe_McCallister \"Zoe McCallister\"). When Kim returns from\nthe city after a break, he is alarmed to learn that Eve has apparently died\nand was the Summer Bay Stalker. His next big shock is Hayley is pregnant and\nhe is possibly the father, [Scott Hunter](/wiki/Scott_Hunter_\\(Home_and_Away\\)\n\"Scott Hunter \\(Home and Away\\)\") ([Kip Gamblin](/wiki/Kip_Gamblin \"Kip\nGamblin\")) who is dating Hayley is also a possibility. Scott and Hayley break\nup, and Kim gets together with Hayley and he proposes, but some people suspect\nHayley is only with Kim because of the baby. On the day of the wedding, Hayley\ndiscovers she still loves Scott and jilts Kim at the altar. Scott proposes to\nHayley and they plan to leave Summer Bay with baby [Noah](/wiki/Noah_Smith\n\"Noah Smith\"), which infuriates Kim and he seeks legal advice. After a\nmeeting, Kim is run over by a car and it is revealed he does not share the\nbaby's blood type, meaning he is not the father despite paternity results\nsaying so (they were secretly swapped by Eve). Scott and Hayley leave for\nParis and Kim becomes depressed.\n\nHe then befriends [Kylie Kopperton](/wiki/Kylie_Kopperton \"Kylie Kopperton\")\n(Leah Etkind) who introduces him to ecstasy. Kim overdoses one night and is\nthrown out of a car outside the hospital during the storm. [Rachel\nArmstrong](/wiki/Rachel_Armstrong \"Rachel Armstrong\") ([Amy\nMathews](/wiki/Amy_Mathews \"Amy Mathews\")) finds him and he is revived. She\nbecomes his counsellor in order to help him handle his recent grief. They\nbecome closer and Kim steps up his quest to woo her and they become a couple.\n[Brian Helpman](/wiki/Brian_Helpman \"Brian Helpman\") (John Noble), Rachel's\nsuperior begins blackmailing her about the relationship and Rachel is forced\nto come clean and is luckily able to continue as a doctor. Kim is shocked when\nBarry is unmasked as the murderer of local mayor [Josh\nWest](/wiki/Josh_West_\\(Home_and_Away\\) \"Josh West \\(Home and Away\\)\")\n([Daniel Collopy](/wiki/Daniel_Collopy \"Daniel Collopy\")) who blackmailed him\nabout the death of Kim's mother, Kerry and stands by his father. During this\ntime, [Charlie McKinnon](/wiki/Charlie_McKinnon \"Charlie McKinnon\") (Matt\nLevett) befriends Kim and Rachel and becomes dangerously obsessed with Kim.\nCharlie kidnaps Rachel but he is foiled and instituationalised. When Eve\nreappears much to the shock of everyone at [Jack\nHolden](/wiki/Jack_Holden_\\(Home_and_Away\\) \"Jack Holden \\(Home and Away\\)\")\n([Paul O'Brien](/wiki/Paul_O%27Brien \"Paul O'Brien\")) and [Martha\nMacKenzie](/wiki/Martha_MacKenzie \"Martha MacKenzie\")'s ([Jodi\nGordon](/wiki/Jodi_Gordon \"Jodi Gordon\")) wedding and causes an explosion\nwhich kills her, [Tracey Thompson](/wiki/Tracey_Thompson \"Tracey Thompson\")\n(Sarah Enright) and Rachel's mother, [Elaine](/wiki/Elaine_Armstrong \"Elaine\nArmstrong\") (Julie Hudspeth), Kim is among the casualties. He, Robbie,\nMatilda, Martha, Kit and [Belle Taylor](/wiki/Belle_Taylor \"Belle Taylor\")\n([Jessica Tovey](/wiki/Jessica_Tovey \"Jessica Tovey\")) are airlifted to the\ncity but their helicopter crashes in the bush, leaving them stranded. While\nthe others go for help, Kim stays behind with Kit and fearing they will die,\nthe pair have sex. The party is found and Kim and Kit's liaison is revealed to\nRachel, who forgives Kim.\n\nFollowing an unfounded accusation from [Tara O'Neill](/wiki/Tara_O%27Neill\n\"Tara O'Neill\") (Cashelle Dunn) of sexual assault and his wedding to Rachel,\nthe drama in Kim's life escalates when Kit returns for the Christmas,\nannouncing she is pregnant with their child. Rachel has some difficulty\naccepting after plans to adopt [Lee Morton](/wiki/Lee_Morton \"Lee Morton\")'s\n([Natasha Lee](/w/index.php?title=Natasha_Lee&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Natasha\nLee \\(page does not exist\\)\")) newborn son\n[Joe](/wiki/Joe_Morton_\\(Home_and_Away\\) \"Joe Morton \\(Home and Away\\)\"), fall\nthrough. Kim and Kit grow closer together and Kim and Rachel's marriage begins\nto feel strained. Kim and Kit share a kiss, and following the revelation that\nRachel slept with [Hugh Sullivan](/wiki/Hugh_Sullivan \"Hugh Sullivan\")\n([Rodger Corser](/wiki/Rodger_Corser \"Rodger Corser\")), Kim decides to leave\nher and be with Kit and baby Archie in the city.\n\n## Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kim_Hyde&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Reception\")]\n\nFor his portrayal of Kim, Hemsworth won the Most Popular New Male Talent award\nat the [2005 Logie Awards](/wiki/Logie_Awards_of_2005 \"Logie Awards of 2005\"),\nhe also received a nomination for [Most Popular\nActor](/wiki/Logie_Award_for_Most_Popular_Actor \"Logie Award for Most Popular\nActor\").[7][8] The following year, Hemsworth was again nominated for Most\nPopular Actor.[9] At the first [Digital Spy Soap\nAwards](/wiki/Digital_Spy_Soap_Awards \"Digital Spy Soap Awards\"), Hemsworth\nearned a nomination for Best Exit.[10] Hannah Rand of _[The Daily\nTelegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph_\\(Sydney\\) \"The Daily Telegraph\n\\(Sydney\\)\")_ said Hemsworth was \"born to play hunky high school dropout\" Kim,\ndue to his physique and pin-up looks.[1]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kim_Hyde&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Rand, Hannah (25 January 2009).
