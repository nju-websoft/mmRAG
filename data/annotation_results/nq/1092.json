Hamilton almost single-handedly\nworked out the nation's early financial system, and for several years was a\nmajor presence in Washington's administration as well.

The Congress had no power to\nlevy and collect taxes, nor was there a tangible basis for securing funds from\nforeign investors or governments. The delegates resolved to issue paper money\nin the form of bills of credit, promising redemption in coin on faith in the\nrevolutionary cause. On June 22, 1775—only a few days after the [Battle of\nBunker Hill](/wiki/Battle_of_Bunker_Hill \"Battle of Bunker Hill\"), Congress\nissued $2 million in bills; on July 25, 28 citizens of Philadelphia were\nemployed by the Congress to sign and number the currency.\n\nOn July 29, 1775, the [Second Continental\nCongress](/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress \"Second Continental Congress\")\nassigned the responsibility for the administration of the revolutionary\ngovernment's finances to Joint Continental Treasurers, [George\nClymer](/wiki/George_Clymer \"George Clymer\") and [Michael\nHillegas](/wiki/Michael_Hillegas \"Michael Hillegas\"). The Congress stipulated\nthat each of the colonies contribute to the Continental government's funds. To\nensure proper and efficient handling of the growing national debt in the face\nof weak economic and political ties between the colonies, the Congress, on\nFebruary 17, 1776, designated a committee of five to superintend the Treasury,\nsettle the accounts, and report periodically to the Congress. On April 1, a\nTreasury Office of Accounts, consisting of an Auditor General and clerks, was\nestablished to facilitate the settlement of claims and to keep the public\naccounts for the government of the United Colonies. With the signing of the\n[Declaration of Independence](/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence \"Declaration\nof Independence\") on July 4, 1776, the new-born republic as a sovereign nation\nwas able to secure loans from abroad.\n\nDespite the infusion of foreign and domestic loans to pay for a war of\nindependence, the United Colonies were unable to establish a well-organized\nagency for financial administration. Michael Hillegas was first called\nTreasurer of the United States on May 14, 1777. The Treasury Office was\nreorganized three times between 1778 and 1781. The $241.5 million of paper\nContinental Dollars devalued rapidly. By May 1781, the dollar collapsed at a\nrate of from 500 to 1000 to 1 against hard currency. Protests against the\nworthless money swept the colonies and angry Americans coined the expression\n\"not worth a Continental\".\n\n[Robert Morris](/wiki/Robert_Morris_\\(financier\\) \"Robert Morris\n\\(financier\\)\") was designated Superintendent of Finance in 1781 and restored\nstability to the nation's finances. Morris, a wealthy colonial merchant, was\nnicknamed \"the Financier\" because of his reputation for procuring funds or\ngoods on a moment's notice. His staff included a Comptroller, a Treasurer, a\nRegister, and auditors, who managed the country's finances through 1784, when\nMorris resigned because of ill health. The Treasury Board of three\nCommissioners continued to oversee the finances of the confederation of former\ncolonies until September 1789.\n\n### Hamilton and the Establishment of the Department of the\nTreasury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Hamilton and the Establishment of the Department of the\nTreasury\")]\n\nThe First Congress of the United States was called to convene in New York on\nMarch 4, 1789, marking the beginning of government under the Constitution. On\nSeptember 2, 1789, Congress created a permanent institution for the management\nof government finances:\n\n> _Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\n> States of America in Congress assembled, That there shall be a Department of\n> Treasury, in which shall be the following officers, namely: a Secretary of\n> the Treasury, to be deemed head of the department; a Comptroller, an\n> Auditor, a Treasurer, a Register, and an Assistant to the Secretary of the\n> Treasury, which assistant shall be appointed by the said Secretary._[3]\n\n[Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\") took the\noath of office as the first [Secretary of the\nTreasury](/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury \"Secretary of the Treasury\") on\nSeptember 11, 1789. Hamilton had served as George Washington's aide-de-camp\nduring the Revolution, and was of great importance in the ratification of the\nConstitution. Because of his financial and managerial acumen, Hamilton was a\nlogical choice for solving the problem of the new nation's heavy war debt.\nHamilton's first official act was to submit a report to Congress in which he\nlaid the foundation for the nation's financial health.\n\nTo the surprise of many legislators, he insisted upon federal assumption and\ndollar-for-dollar repayment of the country's war debt of $75 million in order\nto revitalize the public credit: \"[T]he debt of the United States' was the\nprice of liberty. The faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it, and\nwith solemnities that give peculiar force to the obligation.\" Hamilton foresaw\nthe development of industry and trade in the United States, and suggested that\ngovernment revenues be based upon customs duties. His sound financial policies\nalso inspired investment in the Bank of the United States, which acted as the\ngovernment's fiscal agent.\n\n### 2003\nReorganization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 2003 Reorganization\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Treasury_departement.jpg/220px-\nTreasury_departement.jpg)](/wiki/File:Treasury_departement.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Treasury_departement.jpg \"Ingrandisci\")\n\n[Treasury Building](/wiki/Treasury_Building_\\(Washington,_D.C.\\) \"Treasury\nBuilding \\(Washington, D.C.\\)\")\n\nCongress transferred several agencies that had previously been under the aegis\nof the Treasury department to other departments as a consequence of the\n[September 11, 2001 terrorist\nattacks](/wiki/September_11,_2001_terrorist_attacks \"September 11, 2001\nterrorist attacks\").
