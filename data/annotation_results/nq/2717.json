He is adopted by [Regina Mills](/wiki/Regina_Mills\n\"Regina Mills\") (the Evil Queen), after Mr. Gold (Rumplestiltskin) procures\nhim, naming him after her late father. At first Regina had a little difficulty\nraising Henry but grew to love him, thus preventing Henry from being taken by\nthe Darling Brothers, who wanted to take Henry to Neverland on orders from\nPeter Pan.\n\nAs Henry gets older, his relationship with Regina became strained, and she\nsends him to regular therapy sessions. When he is ten, he receives his\ncherished book of fairy tales from his teacher [Mary Margaret\nBlanchard](/wiki/Mary_Margaret_Blanchard \"Mary Margaret Blanchard\") (Snow\nWhite), discovering that the residents of Storybrooke are characters from it\nafter noticing he is the only one in town who ages. Henry finds his biological\nmother Emma Swan in [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\") and brings her to\nStorybrooke. He eventually convinces her of the truth by consuming a sleeping\ncurse intended for her by Regina,[4] nearly resulting in him dying. However,\nhe is awoken with true love's kiss by Emma, which also breaks the curse. Emma\nand Mary Margaret are then dragged into a portal, leaving David (Prince\nCharming) to look after him. Following the death of Regina's mother Cora, and\nher vowing to avenge Mary Margaret, Henry seeks to remove magic from\nStorybrooke. When Emma and Regina stop the trigger enacted by Greg Mendell and\nTamara from destroying the town, he is kidnapped by the pair and taken to\nNeverland, where it is revealed that Peter Pan (Henry's great-grandfather)\nwants possession of him as he owns \"the heart of the truest believer\".[5][6]\n\n### Seasons\n3–4[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Henry_Mills_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Seasons 3–4\")]\n\nPan eventually persuades Henry to give him his heart, telling him it will save\nmagic.

Mr.\nGold returns Henry to his body, and Emma and Henry escape to New York City\nwhilst the remaining residents return to the Enchanted Forest. A year later,\nHook restores Emma's memories, leading her to return to Storybrooke with Henry\nto save their family from another curse. Henry is confused about Emma's\ndecision to relocate, until his past memories are restored with his book. Once\nhis memories are restored, Regina gives him true love's kiss breaking the\ncurse. Henry then moves back to Storybrooke where he splits his time living\nwith Regina and the Charmings. Henry later helps Regina to search for his\nstorybook's author, Isaac. Upon discovering the writer's manipulative actions,\nHenry being the only one born in the Land Without Magic is left behind in\nStorybrooke and goes to find Isaac and enters his new storybook \"Heroes and\nViilains\" to fix reality and after saving Emma who remembers everything they\nboth try to help Regina get her happy ending to fix reality but fail.

When he arrived\nwith his family, he comes up with a new plan called \"Operation Firebird,\" this\nafter learning that they have a chance to save the souls and help them move\nforward. However, when he comes across Cruella De Vil, he is offered a chance\nto help her return to the living as he is the Author, this after telling him\nthat despite having broken the quill in two he still has the ability to use\nthe quill and magically write her a new life while he was in the underworld\nand at the same time restore Emma's soul as forgiveness, but this would put\nHenry in a situation that would force him to break his vow not to tamper with\nhis family history. He then learns that he has the ability to bring others\nback from the dead when he came across the Apprentice, whose soul can't move\non until Henry makes the right choice, which is to record the events in the\nbook.

Before he returned to Storybrooke, he finished the unfinished\nbusinesses in the book, only to have Cruella hide it in Hades' lair.\n\nUpon returning to Storybrooke, Henry began to experience a roguish streak as\nhe believed magic is destroying his family in the wake of Robin Hood's death.\nThis prompts him and Violet to obtain the Olympian Crystal and flee to New\nYork City where magic can be destroyed. However, his actions also resulted in\nleaving Snow, David, Zelena, and Hook in the Land of Untold Stories when he\nused a holy grail to destroy it. Having regret what he did, Henry turned to a\nfountain and made a wish that he would reunite his family, and with the help\nof Emma, Regina, Violet, and Gold, along the New Yorkers who see him make this\nplea, the fountain succeeds in bringing Snow, David, Zelena, and Hook to New\nYork and with that restored magic. Upon returning to Storybrooke, Henry\nlearned that Violet, although born in Camelot, was actually from Connecticut,\ndue to her father having slipped into an unknown portal.
