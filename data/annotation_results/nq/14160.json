In particular, average income\nand population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some\neconomists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the\n[standard of living](/wiki/Standard_of_living \"Standard of living\") for the\ngeneral population began to increase consistently for the first time in\nhistory, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully\nimprove until the late 19th and 20th centuries.[5][6][7]\n\n[GDP per capita](/wiki/GDP_per_capita \"GDP per capita\") was broadly stable\nbefore the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern\n[capitalist](/wiki/Capitalism \"Capitalism\") economy,[8] while the Industrial\nRevolution began an era of per-capita [economic growth](/wiki/Economic_growth\n\"Economic growth\") in capitalist economies.[9] Economic historians are in\nagreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important\nevent in the [history of humanity](/wiki/History_of_the_world \"History of the\nworld\") since the [domestication](/wiki/Domestication \"Domestication\") of\nanimals and plants.[10]\n\nThe precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among\nhistorians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.[11][12][13][14]\n[Eric Hobsbawm](/wiki/Eric_Hobsbawm \"Eric Hobsbawm\") held that the Industrial\nRevolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the\n1830s or 1840s,[11] while [T. S. Ashton](/wiki/T._S._Ashton \"T. S. Ashton\")\nheld that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830.[12] Rapid\nindustrialization first began in Britain, starting with mechanized spinning in\nthe 1780s,[15] with high rates of growth in steam power and iron production\noccurring after 1800. Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain\nto continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with\nimportant centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in Belgium and the\nUnited States and later textiles in France.[1]\n\nAn economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the\nadoption of the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution, such as\nmechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. Innovations\ndeveloped late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives,\nsteamboats and steamships, hot blast iron smelting and new technologies\ntechnologies, such as the [electrical telegraph](/wiki/Electrical_telegraph\n\"Electrical telegraph\"), widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not\npowerful enough to drive high rates of growth. Rapid economic growth began to\noccur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been\ncalled the [Second Industrial Revolution](/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution\n\"Second Industrial Revolution\"). These new innovations included new steel\nmaking processes, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the use of\nincreasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.[1][16][17][18]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Etymology\n  * 2 Important technological developments\n    * 2.1 Textile manufacture\n      * 2.1.1 British textile industry statistics\n      * 2.1.2 Cotton\n      * 2.1.3 Wool\n      * 2.1.4 Silk\n    * 2.2 Metallurgy\n    * 2.3 Steam power\n    * 2.4 Machine tools\n    * 2.5 Chemicals\n    * 2.6 Cement\n    * 2.7 Gas lighting\n    * 2.8 Glass making\n    * 2.9 Paper machine\n    * 2.10 Agriculture\n    * 2.11 Mining\n    * 2.12 Other developments\n    * 2.13 Transportation\n      * 2.13.1 Canals\n      * 2.13.2 Roads\n      * 2.13.3 Railways\n  * 3 Social effects\n    * 3.1 Factory system\n    * 3.2 Impact on women and family life\n    * 3.3 Standards of living\n      * 3.3.1 Food and nutrition\n      * 3.3.2 Housing\n      * 3.3.3 Clothing and consumer goods\n    * 3.4 Population increase\n    * 3.5 Labour conditions\n      * 3.5.1 Social structure and working conditions\n      * 3.5.2 Factories and urbanisation\n      * 3.5.3 Child labour\n      * 3.5.4 Organisation of labour\n      * 3.5.5 Luddites\n      * 3.5.6 Destruction of hand textile production in India, China, etc.\n      * 3.5.7 Effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery\n    * 3.6 Impact on environment\n    * 3.7 Other effects\n  * 4 Industrialisation beyond the United Kingdom\n    * 4.1 Continental Europe\n      * 4.1.1 Belgium\n        * 4.1.1.1 Demographic effects\n      * 4.1.2 France\n      * 4.1.3 Germany\n      * 4.1.4 Sweden\n    * 4.2 Japan\n    * 4.3 United States\n  * 5 Second Industrial Revolution\n  * 6 Causes\n    * 6.1 Causes in Europe\n    * 6.2 Causes in Britain\n    * 6.3 Transfer of knowledge\n      * 6.3.1 Protestant work ethic\n  * 7 Opposition from Romanticism\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n    * 9.1 Sources\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe earliest recorded use of the term \"Industrial Revolution\" seems to have\nbeen in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy [Louis-Guillaume\nOtto](/wiki/Louis-Guillaume_Otto \"Louis-Guillaume Otto\"), announcing that\nFrance had entered the race to industrialise.[19] In his 1976 book _[Keywords:\nA Vocabulary of Culture and\nSociety](/wiki/Keywords:_A_Vocabulary_of_Culture_and_Society \"Keywords: A\nVocabulary of Culture and Society\")_ , [Raymond\nWilliams](/wiki/Raymond_Williams \"Raymond Williams\") states in the entry for\n\"Industry\": \"The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change\nwas clear in [Southey](/wiki/Robert_Southey \"Robert Southey\") and\n[Owen](/wiki/Robert_Owen \"Robert Owen\"), between 1811 and 1818, and was\nimplicit as early as [Blake](/wiki/William_Blake \"William Blake\") in the early\n1790s and [Wordsworth](/wiki/William_Wordsworth \"William Wordsworth\") at the\nturn of the [19th] century.\" The term _Industrial Revolution_ applied to\ntechnological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in\n[Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui](/wiki/J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me-Adolphe_Blanqui \"Jérôme-\nAdolphe Blanqui\")'s description in 1837 of _la révolution industrielle_.[20]\n[Friedrich Engels](/wiki/Friedrich_Engels \"Friedrich Engels\") in _[The\nCondition of the Working Class in\nEngland](/wiki/The_Condition_of_the_Working_Class_in_England \"The Condition of\nthe Working Class in England\")_ in 1844 spoke of \"an industrial revolution, a\nrevolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society\".\nHowever, although Engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into\nEnglish until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday\nlanguage until then. Credit for popularising the term may be given to [Arnold\nToynbee](/wiki/Arnold_Toynbee \"Arnold Toynbee\"), whose 1881 lectures gave a\ndetailed account of the term.[21]\n\nSome historians, such as [John\nClapham](/wiki/John_Clapham_\\(economic_historian\\) \"John Clapham \\(economic\nhistorian\\)\") and [Nicholas Crafts](/wiki/Nicholas_Crafts \"Nicholas Crafts\"),\nhave argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the\nterm _revolution_ is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among some\nhistorians.\n\n## Important technological developments\n\nThe commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small\nnumber of innovations,[22] beginning in the second half of the 18th century.\nBy the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies:\n\n  * **Textiles** – mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of around 500. The [power loom](/wiki/Power_loom \"Power loom\") increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40.[23] The [cotton gin](/wiki/Cotton_gin \"Cotton gin\") increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50.[17] Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen, but they were not as great as in cotton.[24]\n  * **Steam power** – the efficiency of [steam engines](/wiki/Steam_engine \"Steam engine\") increased so that they used between one-fifth and one-tenth as much fuel. The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses.[25] The high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio, making it suitable for transportation.[26] Steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800.\n  * **Iron making** – the substitution of [coke](/wiki/Coke_\\(fuel\\) \"Coke \\(fuel\\)\") for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost for pig iron and wrought iron production.[27] Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces,[28][29] resulting in economies of scale. The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760. It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher [blast furnace](/wiki/Blast_furnace \"Blast furnace\") temperatures. The [puddling process](/wiki/Puddling_\\(metallurgy\\) \"Puddling \\(metallurgy\\)\") produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the [finery forge](/wiki/Finery_forge \"Finery forge\").[30] The [rolling mill](/wiki/Rolling_\\(metalworking\\) \"Rolling \\(metalworking\\)\") was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. [Hot blast](/wiki/Hot_blast \"Hot blast\") (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.\n  * **Invention of machine tools** – The first [machine tools](/wiki/Machine_tools \"Machine tools\") were invented. These included the [screw cutting lathe](/wiki/Screw_cutting_lathe \"Screw cutting lathe\"), cylinder boring machine and the [milling machine](/wiki/Milling_\\(machining\\) \"Milling \\(machining\\)\").\n\n### Textile manufacture\n\nMain article: [Textile manufacture during the Industrial\nRevolution](/wiki/Textile_manufacture_during_the_Industrial_Revolution\n\"Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution\")\n\n#### British textile industry statistics\n\nThe share of value added by the cotton textile industry in Britain was 2.6% in\n1760, 17% in 1801 and 22.4% in 1831. Value added by the British woollen\nindustry was 14.1% in 1801. Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately\n900 in 1797. In 1760 approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in\nBritain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800. In 1781 cotton spun\namounted to 5.1 million pounds, which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800.\nIn 1800 less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery\ninvented in Britain. In 1788 there were 50,000 spindles in Britain, rising to\n7 million over the next 30 years.[31]\n\nWages in [Lancashire](/wiki/Lancashire \"Lancashire\"), a core region for\ncottage industry and later factory spinning and weaving, were about one-sixth\nthose in India in 1770, when overall [productivity](/wiki/Productivity\n\"Productivity\") in Britain was about three times higher than in India.[31]\n\n#### Cotton\n\nParts of India, China and the Middle-East have a long history of hand\nmanufacturing [cotton](/wiki/Cotton \"Cotton\") textiles, which became a major\nindustry sometime after 1000 AD. In tropical and subtropical regions where it\nwas grown, most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was\nspun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption. In the 15th\ncentury China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton\ncloth. By the 17th century almost all Chinese wore cotton clothing. Almost\neverywhere cotton cloth could be used as a [medium of\nexchange](/wiki/Medium_of_exchange \"Medium of exchange\"). In India a\nsignificant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets,\noften produced by professional weavers. Some merchants also owned small\nweaving workshops. India produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of\nexceptionally fine quality.[31]\n\nThe [Age of Discovery](/wiki/Age_of_Discovery \"Age of Discovery\") was followed\nby a period of [colonialism](/wiki/Colonialism \"Colonialism\") beginning around\nthe 16th century. Following the opening of a trade route to India around\nsouthern Africa by the Portuguese, the Dutch established the Verenigde\nOostindische Compagnie (abbr. VOC) or [Dutch East India\nCompany](/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company \"Dutch East India Company\") and the\nBritish founded the [East India Company](/wiki/East_India_Company \"East India\nCompany\"), along with smaller companies of different nationalities which\nestablished trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout\nthe Indian Ocean region and between the Indian Ocean region and North Atlantic\nEurope. One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles,\nwhich were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia, including the\nIndonesian archipelago, where spices were purchased for sale to Southeast Asia\nand Europe. By the mid 1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the East India\nCompany's exports. Indian textiles were in demand in North Atlantic region of\nEurope where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the\namount of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early\n19th century.[31]\n\nBy 1600 Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns where\ncottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established; however,\nthey were left alone by the guilds who did not consider cotton a threat.\nEarlier European attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in 12th century\nItaly and 15th century southern Germany, but these industries eventually ended\nwhen the supply of cotton was cut off. The Moors in Spain grew, spun and wove\ncotton beginning around the 10th century.[31]\n\nBritish cloth could not compete with Indian cloth because India's labor cost\nwas approximately one-fifth that of Britain's.[32] In 1700 and 1721 the\nBritish government passed [Calico Acts](/wiki/Calico_Acts \"Calico Acts\") in\norder to [protect](/wiki/Protectionism \"Protectionism\") the domestic woollen\nand linen industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported\nfrom India.[25][33]\n\nThe demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around\n[Lancashire](/wiki/Lancashire \"Lancashire\") that produced\n[fustian](/wiki/Fustian \"Fustian\"), a cloth with flax\n[warp](/wiki/Warp_\\(weaving\\) \"Warp \\(weaving\\)\") and cotton [weft](/wiki/Weft\n\"Weft\"). Flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have\nsufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100% cotton\nand was more difficult to sew.[33]\n\nOn the eve of the Industrial Revolution, spinning and weaving were done in\nhouseholds, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the\n[putting-out system](/wiki/Putting-out_system \"Putting-out system\").\nOccasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the\nputting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant\nsellers, who often supplied the raw materials. In the off season the women,\ntypically farmers' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving. Using\nthe [spinning wheel](/wiki/Spinning_wheel \"Spinning wheel\"), it took anywhere\nfrom four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver.[24][33][34]:823\nThe [flying shuttle](/wiki/Flying_shuttle \"Flying shuttle\") patented in 1733\nby [John Kay](/wiki/John_Kay_\\(flying_shuttle\\) \"John Kay \\(flying\nshuttle\\)\"), with a number of subsequent improvements including an important\none in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between\nspinning and weaving. It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when\nJohn's son, [Robert](/wiki/Robert_Kay_\\(inventor\\) \"Robert Kay \\(inventor\\)\"),\ninvented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors.[34]:821–22\n\n[Lewis Paul](/wiki/Lewis_Paul \"Lewis Paul\") patented the roller [spinning\nframe](/wiki/Spinning_frame \"Spinning frame\") and the flyer-and-bobbin system\nfor drawing wool to a more even thickness. The technology was developed with\nthe help of John Wyatt of [Birmingham](/wiki/Birmingham \"Birmingham\"). Paul\nand Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine\npowered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in\n[Northampton](/wiki/Northampton \"Northampton\") with 50 spindles on each of\nfive of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar\nmill was built by [Daniel Bourn](/wiki/Daniel_Bourn \"Daniel Bourn\") in\n[Leominster](/wiki/Leominster \"Leominster\"), but this burnt down. Both Lewis\nPaul and Daniel Bourn patented [carding](/wiki/Carding \"Carding\") machines in\n1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was\nlater used in the first [cotton spinning mill](/wiki/Cotton_mill \"Cotton\nmill\"). Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by [Richard\nArkwright](/wiki/Richard_Arkwright \"Richard Arkwright\") in his [water\nframe](/wiki/Water_frame \"Water frame\") and [Samuel\nCrompton](/wiki/Samuel_Crompton \"Samuel Crompton\") in his [spinning\nmule](/wiki/Spinning_mule \"Spinning mule\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Spinning_jenny.jpg/230px-\nSpinning_jenny.jpg)](/wiki/File:Spinning_jenny.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Spinning_jenny.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nModel of the [spinning jenny](/wiki/Spinning_jenny \"Spinning jenny\") in a\nmuseum in [Wuppertal](/wiki/Wuppertal \"Wuppertal\"). Invented by [James\nHargreaves](/wiki/James_Hargreaves \"James Hargreaves\") in 1764, the spinning\njenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution.\n\nIn 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, [James\nHargreaves](/wiki/James_Hargreaves \"James Hargreaves\") invented the [spinning\njenny](/wiki/Spinning_jenny \"Spinning jenny\"), which he patented in 1770. It\nwas the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.[35] The jenny\nworked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on\nthe fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting.[36] It was a\nsimple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model\nin 1792,[37] and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a\nlightly twisted yarn only suitable for [weft](/wiki/Weft \"Weft\"), not\n[warp](/wiki/Warp_\\(weaving\\) \"Warp \\(weaving\\)\").[34]:825–27\n\nThe spinning frame or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who,\nalong with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a\nspinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired\nby Arkwright.[34]:827–30 For each spindle, the water frame used a series of\nfour pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed,\nto draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle. The roller\nspacing was slightly longer than the fibre length. Too close a spacing caused\nthe fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread. The top\nrollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a\nweight. The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The\nbottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length. The water\nframe was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp,\nfinally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain. A horse powered the\nfirst factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water\npower at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its\nname.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Mule-jenny.jpg/220px-\nMule-jenny.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mule-jenny.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mule-jenny.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe only surviving example of a [spinning mule](/wiki/Spinning_mule \"Spinning\nmule\") built by the inventor [Samuel Crompton](/wiki/Samuel_Crompton \"Samuel\nCrompton\"). The mule produced high quality thread with minimal labour.\n\n[Samuel Crompton](/wiki/Samuel_Crompton \"Samuel Crompton\")'s [Spinning\nMule](/wiki/Spinning_mule \"Spinning mule\") was introduced in 1779. Mule\nimplies \"hybrid\" because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the\nwater frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went\nthrough an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the\ncarriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres\nas the spindles started rotating.[34]:832 Crompton's mule was able to produce\nfiner thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost. Mule spun thread was of\nsuitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce\nhighly competitive yarn in large quantities.[34]:832\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Marshall%27s_flax-\nmill%2C_Holbeck%2C_Leeds_-_interior_-_c.1800.jpg/220px-Marshall%27s_flax-\nmill%2C_Holbeck%2C_Leeds_-_interior_-\n_c.1800.jpg)](/wiki/File:Marshall%27s_flax-mill,_Holbeck,_Leeds_-_interior_-\n_c.1800.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Marshall%27s_flax-mill,_Holbeck,_Leeds_-_interior_-_c.1800.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nInterior of Marshall's [Temple Works](/wiki/Temple_Works \"Temple Works\")\n\nRealising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase\nthe supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright\ndeveloped a vertical [power loom](/wiki/Power_loom \"Power loom\") which he\npatented in 1785. In 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more\nconventional.[34]:834 Cartwright built two factories; the first burned down\nand the second was sabotaged by his workers. Cartwright's loom design had\nseveral flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. Samuel Horrocks\npatented a fairly successful loom in 1813. Horock's loom was improved by\nRichard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts,\nHill & Co.[38]\n\nThe demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern\nUnited States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a\nbetter way could be found to remove the seed. [Eli Whitney](/wiki/Eli_Whitney\n\"Eli Whitney\") responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive [cotton\ngin](/wiki/Cotton_gin \"Cotton gin\"). With a cotton gin a man could remove seed\nfrom as much upland cotton in one day as would have previously taken a woman\nworking two months to process at one pound per day.[17]\n\nThese advances were capitalised on by [entrepreneurs](/wiki/Entrepreneur\n\"Entrepreneur\"), of whom the best known is Richard Arkwright. He is credited\nwith a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as\n[Thomas Highs](/wiki/Thomas_Highs \"Thomas Highs\") and [John\nKay](/wiki/John_Kay_\\(spinning_frame\\) \"John Kay \\(spinning frame\\)\");\nArkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the\ninitiatives, and protected the machines. He created the [cotton\nmill](/wiki/Cotton_mill \"Cotton mill\") which brought the production processes\ntogether in a factory, and he developed the use of power – first horse power\nand then [water power](/wiki/Hydropower \"Hydropower\")—which made cotton\nmanufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of\nthe individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling)\nso that the supply of [yarn](/wiki/Yarn \"Yarn\") increased greatly. Before long\n[steam power](/wiki/Watt_steam_engine \"Watt steam engine\") was applied to\ndrive textile machinery. [Manchester](/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\") acquired\nthe nickname [Cottonopolis](/wiki/Cottonopolis \"Cottonopolis\") during the\nearly 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.[39]\n\nAlthough mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the\nmid-19th century machine woven cloth still could not equal the quality of hand\nwoven Indian cloth, in part due to the fineness of thread made possible by the\ntype of cotton used in India, which allowed high tread counts. However, the\nhigh productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of\nBritish cloth to undersell hand spun and woven fabric in low-wage India,\neventually destroying the industry.[31]\n\n#### Wool\n\nThe earliest attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool\nspinning proved more difficult to mechanize than cotton. Productivity\nimprovement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant,\nbut was far less that that of cotton.[40][41]\n\n#### Silk\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Silkmill1.jpg/220px-\nSilkmill1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Silkmill1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Silkmill1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLombe's Mill site today, rebuilt as [Derby Silk Mill](/wiki/Derby_Silk_Mill\n\"Derby Silk Mill\")\n\nArguably the first highly mechanised factory was [John Lombe](/wiki/John_Lombe\n\"John Lombe\")'s [water-powered silk mill](/wiki/Derby_Industrial_Museum \"Derby\nIndustrial Museum\") at [Derby](/wiki/Derby \"Derby\"), operational by 1721.\nLombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as\nan industrial spy; however, since the silk industry there was a closely\nguarded secret, the state of the industry there is unknown. Although Lombe's\nfactory was technically successful, the supply of raw silk from Italy was cut\noff to eliminate competition. In order to promote manufacturing the Crown paid\nfor models of Lombe's machinery which were exhibited in the [Tower of\nLondon](/wiki/Tower_of_London \"Tower of London\").[42][43]\n\n### Metallurgy\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Reverberatory_furnace_diagram.png/220px-\nReverberatory_furnace_diagram.png)](/wiki/File:Reverberatory_furnace_diagram.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Reverberatory_furnace_diagram.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [reverberatory furnace](/wiki/Reverberatory_furnace \"Reverberatory\nfurnace\") could produce [cast iron](/wiki/Cast_iron \"Cast iron\") using mined\ncoal. The burning coal remained separate from the iron ore and so did not\ncontaminate the iron with impurities like sulphur and ash. This opened the way\nto increased iron production.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Ironbridge_6.jpg/220px-\nIronbridge_6.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ironbridge_6.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ironbridge_6.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[The Iron Bridge](/wiki/The_Iron_Bridge \"The Iron Bridge\"),\n[Shropshire](/wiki/Shropshire \"Shropshire\"), England\n\nA major change in the metal industries during the era of the Industrial\nRevolution was the replacement of [wood](/wiki/Wood \"Wood\") and other bio-\nfuels with coal. For a given amount of heat, coal required much less labour to\nmine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal,[44] and coal was more\nabundant than wood.[24]\n\nIn the smelting and refining of iron, coal and to a lesser degree coke\nproduced inferior iron than charcoal because the impurities in coal, at least\nuntil solutions to contamination were developed. Use of coal in\n[smelting](/wiki/Smelting \"Smelting\") started somewhat before the Industrial\nRevolution, based on innovations by Sir [Clement Clerke](/wiki/Clement_Clerke\n\"Clement Clerke\") and others from 1678, using coal [reverberatory\nfurnaces](/wiki/Reverberatory_furnace \"Reverberatory furnace\") known as\ncupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the [ore](/wiki/Ore\n\"Ore\") and charcoal or [coke](/wiki/Coke_\\(fuel\\) \"Coke \\(fuel\\)\") mixture,\n[reducing](/wiki/Redox \"Redox\") the [oxide](/wiki/Oxide \"Oxide\") to metal.\nThis has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do\nnot migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to [lead](/wiki/Lead\n\"Lead\") from 1678 and to [copper](/wiki/Copper \"Copper\") from 1687. It was\nalso applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the\nreverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The [foundry\ncupola](/wiki/Cupola_furnace \"Cupola furnace\") is a different (and later)\ninnovation.)\n\nThis was followed by [Abraham Darby](/wiki/Abraham_Darby_I \"Abraham Darby I\"),\nwho made great strides using coke to fuel his [blast\nfurnaces](/wiki/Blast_furnace \"Blast furnace\") at\n[Coalbrookdale](/wiki/Coalbrookdale \"Coalbrookdale\") in 1709. However, the\ncoke [pig iron](/wiki/Pig_iron \"Pig iron\") he made was used mostly for the\nproduction of [cast iron](/wiki/Cast_iron \"Cast iron\") goods, such as pots and\nkettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his\npatented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs. Coke pig iron was\nhardly used to produce [wrought iron](/wiki/Wrought_iron \"Wrought iron\") in\nforges until the mid-1750s, when his son [Abraham Darby\nII](/wiki/Abraham_Darby_II \"Abraham Darby II\") built [Horsehay](/wiki/Horsehay\n\"Horsehay\") and [Ketley](/wiki/Ketley \"Ketley\") furnaces (not far from\nCoalbrookdale). By then, coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron.\nSince cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it began being a\nstructural material following the building of the innovative [Iron\nBridge](/wiki/The_Iron_Bridge \"The Iron Bridge\") in 1778 by [Abraham Darby\nIII](/wiki/Abraham_Darby_III \"Abraham Darby III\").\n\nWrought iron for smiths to forge into consumer goods was still made in [finery\nforges](/wiki/Finery_forge \"Finery forge\"), as it long had been. However, new\nprocesses were adopted in the ensuing years. The first is referred to today as\n[potting and stamping](/wiki/Potting_and_stamping \"Potting and stamping\"), but\nthis was superseded by [Henry Cort](/wiki/Henry_Cort \"Henry Cort\")'s\n[puddling](/wiki/Puddling_furnace \"Puddling furnace\") process. Cort developed\ntwo significant iron manufacturing processes:\n[rolling](/wiki/Rolling_\\(metalworking\\) \"Rolling \\(metalworking\\)\") in 1783\nand [puddling](/wiki/Puddling_\\(metallurgy\\) \"Puddling \\(metallurgy\\)\") in\n1784.[30] Rolling replaced hammering for consolidating wrought iron and\nexpelling some of the dross. Rolling was 15 times faster than hammering with a\ntrip hammer. Roller mills were first used for making sheets, but later were\ndeveloped for rolling structural shapes such as angles and rails.\n\nPuddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost. Puddling\nwas a means of decarburizing pig iron by slow oxidation as the iron was\nmanually stirred using a long rod. The decarburized iron, having a higher\nmelting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler. When the\nglob was large enough the puddler would remove it. Puddling was backbreaking\nand extremely hot work. Few puddlers lived to be 40.[45] Puddling was done in\na reverberatory furnace, allowing coal or coke to be used as fuel. The\npuddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron\nwas being displaced by steel. Because puddling required human skill in sensing\nthe iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised.\n\nUp to that time, British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of\nimported iron to supplement native supplies. This came principally from Sweden\nfrom the mid-17th century and later also from Russia from the end of the\n1720s. However, from 1785, imports decreased because of the new iron making\ntechnology, and Britain became an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured\nwrought iron [consumer goods](/wiki/Final_good \"Final good\").\n\n[Hot blast](/wiki/Hot_blast \"Hot blast\"), patented by [James Beaumont\nNeilson](/wiki/James_Beaumont_Neilson \"James Beaumont Neilson\") in 1828, was\nthe most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making\npig iron. By using waste exhaust heat to preheat combustion air, the amount of\nfuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third\nusing coal or two-thirds using coke;[46] however, the efficiency gains\ncontinued as the technology improved.[47] Hot blast also raised the operating\ntemperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity. Using less coal or coke\nmeant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron. This meant that lower\nquality coal or [anthracite](/wiki/Anthracite \"Anthracite\") could be used in\nareas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive;[48] however, by the\nend of the 19th century transportation costs fell considerably.\n\nTwo decades before the Industrial Revolution an improvement was made in the\nproduction of [steel](/wiki/Steel \"Steel\"), which was an expensive commodity\nand used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for\nsprings. [Benjamin Huntsman](/wiki/Benjamin_Huntsman \"Benjamin Huntsman\")\ndeveloped his [crucible steel](/wiki/Crucible_steel \"Crucible steel\")\ntechnique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by\nthe [cementation process](/wiki/Cementation_process \"Cementation process\").\n\nThe supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as\nthose making nails, hinges, wire and other hardware items. The development of\n[machine tools](/wiki/Machine_tool \"Machine tool\") allowed better working of\niron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and\nengine industries.\n\n### Steam power\n\nMain article: [Steam power during the Industrial\nRevolution](/wiki/Steam_power_during_the_Industrial_Revolution \"Steam power\nduring the Industrial Revolution\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg/270px-\nMaquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg)](/wiki/File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [Watt steam engine](/wiki/Watt_steam_engine \"Watt steam engine\"). [James\nWatt](/wiki/James_Watt \"James Watt\") transformed the [steam\nengine](/wiki/Steam_engine \"Steam engine\") from a [reciprocating\nmotion](/wiki/Reciprocating_motion \"Reciprocating motion\") that was used for\npumping to a [rotating motion](/wiki/Rotation \"Rotation\") suited to industrial\napplications. Watt and others significantly improved the efficiency of the\nsteam engine.\n\nThe development of the [stationary steam engine](/wiki/Stationary_steam_engine\n\"Stationary steam engine\") was an important element of the Industrial\nRevolution; however, during the early period of the Industrial Revolution,\nmost industrial power was supplied by water and wind. In Britain by 1800 an\nestimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam. By 1815 steam power\nhad grown to 210,000 hp.[49]\n\nThe first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to\n[Thomas Savery](/wiki/Thomas_Savery \"Thomas Savery\") in 1698. He constructed\nand patented in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump,\nthat generated about one [horsepower](/wiki/Horsepower \"Horsepower\") (hp) and\nwas used in numerous water works and in a few mines (hence its \"brand name\",\n_The Miner 's Friend_). Savery's pump was economical in small horsepower\nranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes. Savery pumps\ncontinued to be produced until the late 18th century.\n\nThe first successful piston steam engine was introduced by [Thomas\nNewcomen](/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen \"Thomas Newcomen\") before 1712. A number of\nNewcomen engines were installed in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable\ndeep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines,\nrequiring a lot of capital to build, and produced about 5 hp (3.7 kW). They\nwere also used to power municipal water supply pumps. They were extremely\ninefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit\nheads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go\ndeeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy\nto maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades\nof the 19th century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread\n(first) to Hungary in 1722, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. A total of 110 are\nknown to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14\nwere abroad. In the 1770s the engineer [John Smeaton](/wiki/John_Smeaton \"John\nSmeaton\") built some very large examples and introduced a number of\nimprovements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.[50]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Newcomens_Dampfmaschine_aus_Meyers_1890.png/170px-\nNewcomens_Dampfmaschine_aus_Meyers_1890.png)](/wiki/File:Newcomens_Dampfmaschine_aus_Meyers_1890.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Newcomens_Dampfmaschine_aus_Meyers_1890.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Newcomen's steam-powered atmospheric engine](/wiki/Newcomen_steam_engine\n\"Newcomen steam engine\") was the first practical piston steam engine.\nSubsequent steam engines were to power the Industrial Revolution.\n\nA fundamental change in working principles was brought about by\n[Scotsman](/wiki/Scottish_people \"Scottish people\") [James\nWatt](/wiki/James_Watt \"James Watt\"). With financial support from his business\npartner [Englishman](/wiki/English_people \"English people\") [Matthew\nBoulton](/wiki/Matthew_Boulton \"Matthew Boulton\"), he had succeeded by 1778 in\nperfecting his [steam engine](/wiki/Watt_steam_engine \"Watt steam engine\"),\nwhich incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off\nof the upper part of the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive\nthe top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the\ncelebrated separate steam condenser chamber. The separate condenser did away\nwith the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder,\nwhich cooled the cylinder and wasted steam. Likewise, the steam jacket kept\nsteam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency. These\nimprovements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton & Watts engines used\nonly 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt\nopened the [Soho Foundry](/wiki/Soho_Foundry \"Soho Foundry\") for the\nmanufacture of such engines in 1795.\n\nBy 1783 the Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a [double-\nacting](/wiki/Single-_and_double-acting_cylinders \"Single- and double-acting\ncylinders\") rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive\nthe rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types\nwere commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm [Boulton &\nWatt](/wiki/Boulton_and_Watt \"Boulton and Watt\") had constructed 496 engines,\nwith 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving [blast\nfurnaces](/wiki/Blast_furnace \"Blast furnace\"), and 308 powering mill\nmachinery; most of the engines generated from 5 to 10 hp (3.7 to 7.5 kW).\n\nUntil about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the [beam\nengine](/wiki/Beam_engine \"Beam engine\"), built as an integral part of a stone\nor brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative\nengines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the\n[table engine](/wiki/Table_engine \"Table engine\"). Around the start of the\n19th century, at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired, the Cornish\nengineer [Richard Trevithick](/wiki/Richard_Trevithick \"Richard Trevithick\")\nand the American [Oliver Evans](/wiki/Oliver_Evans \"Oliver Evans\") began to\nconstruct higher-pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the\natmosphere. High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be\nused on mobile road and rail [locomotives](/wiki/Locomotive \"Locomotive\") and\n[steam boats](/wiki/Steamboat \"Steamboat\").\n\nThe development of [machine tools](/wiki/Machine_tool \"Machine tool\"), such as\nthe engine [lathe](/wiki/Lathe \"Lathe\"),\n[planing](/wiki/Planer_\\(metalworking\\) \"Planer \\(metalworking\\)\"), milling\nand shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of\nthe engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to\nbuild larger and more powerful engines.\n\nSmall industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and\nhuman muscle until widespread [electrification](/wiki/Electrification\n\"Electrification\") in the early 20th century. These included\n[crank](/wiki/Crank_\\(mechanism\\) \"Crank \\(mechanism\\)\")-powered,\n[treadle](/wiki/Treadle \"Treadle\")-powered and horse-powered workshop and\nlight industrial machinery.[51]\n\n### Machine tools\n\nMain article: [Machine tool](/wiki/Machine_tool \"Machine tool\")\n\nSee also: [Interchangeable parts](/wiki/Interchangeable_parts \"Interchangeable\nparts\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maudslay_screw-\ncutting_lathes_of_circa_1797_and_1800.png/220px-Maudslay_screw-\ncutting_lathes_of_circa_1797_and_1800.png)](/wiki/File:Maudslay_screw-\ncutting_lathes_of_circa_1797_and_1800.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Maudslay_screw-cutting_lathes_of_circa_1797_and_1800.png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nMaudslay's famous early screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Middletown_milling_machine_1818\n--001.png/220px-Middletown_milling_machine_1818--\n001.png)](/wiki/File:Middletown_milling_machine_1818--001.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Middletown_milling_machine_1818--001.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Middletown [milling machine](/wiki/Milling_\\(machining\\) \"Milling\n\\(machining\\)\") of circa 1818, associated with Robert Johnson and Simeon North\n\nPre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen –\n[millwrights](/wiki/Millwright \"Millwright\") built water and wind mills,\n[carpenters](/wiki/Carpenter \"Carpenter\") made wooden framing, and smiths and\nturners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing\ndimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to\nrack (work loose) over time. As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines\nwith metal parts and frames became more common. Other important uses of metal\nparts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts\nand nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts. Precision\nwould allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and\nstandardization of threaded fasteners.\n\nThe demand for metal parts led to the development of several [machine\ntools](/wiki/Machine_tool \"Machine tool\"). They have their origins in the\ntools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and\nscientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms.\n\nBefore the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic\nhand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Consequently, the\nuse of metal was kept to a minimum. Hand methods of production were very\nlaborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve.\n\nThe first large machine tool was the cylinder [boring\nmachine](/wiki/Boring_\\(manufacturing\\) \"Boring \\(manufacturing\\)\") used for\nboring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. The [planing\nmachine](/wiki/Planer_\\(metalworking\\) \"Planer \\(metalworking\\)\"), the\n[milling machine](/wiki/Milling_\\(machining\\) \"Milling \\(machining\\)\") and the\n[shaping machine](/wiki/Shaper \"Shaper\") were developed in the early decades\nof the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time,\nit was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the\n19th century.\n\n[Henry Maudslay](/wiki/Henry_Maudslay \"Henry Maudslay\"), who trained a school\nof machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a mechanic with superior\nability who had been employed at the [Royal Arsenal](/wiki/Royal_Arsenal\n\"Royal Arsenal\"), [Woolwich](/wiki/Woolwich \"Woolwich\"). He worked as an\napprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of [Jan Verbruggen](/wiki/Jan_Verbruggen\n\"Jan Verbruggen\"). In 1774 [Jan Verbruggen](/wiki/Jan_Verbruggen \"Jan\nVerbruggen\") had installed a [horizontal boring\nmachine](/wiki/Horizontal_boring_machine \"Horizontal boring machine\") in\nWoolwich which was the first industrial size [Lathe](/wiki/Lathe \"Lathe\") in\nthe UK. He was hired away by [Joseph Bramah](/wiki/Joseph_Bramah \"Joseph\nBramah\") for the production of high security metal locks that required\nprecision craftsmanship. Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the\nslide rest lathe. Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut\nmachine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between\nthe spindle and the lead screw. Before its invention screws could not be cut\nto any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied\nfrom a template.[17][34]:392–95 The slide rest lathe was called one of\nhistory's most important inventions, although not entirely Maudslay's idea, he\nwas the first person to build a functional lathe using a combination of known\ninnovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.[17]:31, 36\n\nMaudslay left Bramah's employment and set up his own shop. He was engaged to\nbuild the machinery for making ships' pulley blocks for the [Royal\nNavy](/wiki/Royal_Navy \"Royal Navy\") in the [Portsmouth Block\nMills](/wiki/Portsmouth_Block_Mills \"Portsmouth Block Mills\"). These machines\nwere all-metal and were the first machines for [mass\nproduction](/wiki/Mass_production \"Mass production\") and making components\nwith a degree of [interchangeability](/wiki/Interchangeable_parts\n\"Interchangeable parts\"). The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for\nstability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in\nhis workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as\n[Richard Roberts](/wiki/Richard_Roberts_\\(engineer\\) \"Richard Roberts\n\\(engineer\\)\"), [Joseph Clement](/wiki/Joseph_Clement \"Joseph Clement\") and\n[Joseph Whitworth](/wiki/Joseph_Whitworth \"Joseph Whitworth\").\n\n[James Fox](/wiki/James_Fox_\\(engineer\\) \"James Fox \\(engineer\\)\") of\n[Derby](/wiki/Derby \"Derby\") had a healthy export trade in machine tools for\nthe first third of the century, as did [Matthew Murray](/wiki/Matthew_Murray\n\"Matthew Murray\") of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools\nand a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop\nmeasurement.\n\nThe impact of machine tools during the Industrial Revolution was not that\ngreat because other than firearms, threaded fasteners and a few other\nindustries there were few mass-produced metal parts. The techniques to make\nmass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be\n[interchangeable](/wiki/Interchangeable_parts \"Interchangeable parts\") is\nlargely attributed to a program of the U.S. Department of War which perfected\n[interchangeable parts](/wiki/Interchangeable_parts \"Interchangeable parts\")\nfor firearms in the early 19th century.[52]\n\nIn the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools\nthe [machine industry](/wiki/Machine_industry \"Machine industry\") became the\nlargest industrial sector of the U.S. economy, by value added.[53]\n\n### Chemicals\n\nThe large scale production of [chemicals](/wiki/Chemical_substance \"Chemical\nsubstance\") was an important development during the Industrial Revolution. The\nfirst of these was the production of [sulphuric acid](/wiki/Sulfuric_acid\n\"Sulfuric acid\") by the [lead chamber process](/wiki/Lead_chamber_process\n\"Lead chamber process\") invented by the Englishman [John\nRoebuck](/wiki/John_Roebuck \"John Roebuck\") ([James Watt](/wiki/James_Watt\n\"James Watt\")'s first partner) in 1746. He was able to greatly increase the\nscale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels\nformerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of\n[riveted](/wiki/Rivet \"Rivet\") sheets of [lead](/wiki/Lead \"Lead\"). Instead of\nmaking a small amount each time, he was able to make around 100 pounds (50 kg)\nin each of the chambers, at least a tenfold increase.\n\nThe production of an [alkali](/wiki/Alkali \"Alkali\") on a large scale became\nan important goal as well, and [Nicolas Leblanc](/wiki/Nicolas_Leblanc\n\"Nicolas Leblanc\") succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the\nproduction of [sodium carbonate](/wiki/Sodium_carbonate \"Sodium carbonate\").\nThe [Leblanc process](/wiki/Leblanc_process \"Leblanc process\") was a reaction\nof sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and\n[hydrochloric acid](/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid \"Hydrochloric acid\"). The [sodium\nsulphate](/wiki/Sodium_sulfate \"Sodium sulfate\") was heated with\n[limestone](/wiki/Limestone \"Limestone\") ([calcium\ncarbonate](/wiki/Calcium_carbonate \"Calcium carbonate\")) and coal to give a\nmixture of sodium carbonate and [calcium sulphide](/wiki/Calcium_sulfide\n\"Calcium sulfide\"). Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from\nthe calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the\nhydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a\nuseless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic [soda\nash](/wiki/Sodium_carbonate \"Sodium carbonate\") proved economical compared to\nthat from burning specific plants ([barilla](/wiki/Barilla \"Barilla\")) or from\n[kelp](/wiki/Kelp \"Kelp\"), which were the previously dominant sources of soda\nash,[54] and also to [potash](/wiki/Potash \"Potash\") ([potassium\ncarbonate](/wiki/Potassium_carbonate \"Potassium carbonate\")) produced from\nhardwood ashes.\n\nThese two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction\nof a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more\ncost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in\nthe glass, textile, soap, and [paper](/wiki/Paper \"Paper\") industries. Early\nuses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and\nfor [bleaching](/wiki/Bleach \"Bleach\") cloth.\n\nThe development of bleaching powder ([calcium\nhypochlorite](/wiki/Calcium_hypochlorite \"Calcium hypochlorite\")) by Scottish\nchemist [Charles Tennant](/wiki/Charles_Tennant \"Charles Tennant\") in about\n1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist [Claude Louis\nBerthollet](/wiki/Claude_Louis_Berthollet \"Claude Louis Berthollet\"),\nrevolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically\nreducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process\nthen in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields\nafter soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant's factory at St\nRollox, North [Glasgow](/wiki/Glasgow \"Glasgow\"), became the largest chemical\nplant in the world.\n\nAfter 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in [dyestuffs](/wiki/Dye\n\"Dye\"), and Germany took world leadership, building a strong chemical\nindustry.[55] Aspiring chemists flocked to German universities in the\n1860–1914 era to learn the latest techniques. British scientists by contrast,\nlacked research universities and did not train advanced students; instead the\npractice was to hire German-trained chemists.[56]\n\n### Cement\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Thamestunnel.jpg/220px-\nThamestunnel.jpg)](/wiki/File:Thamestunnel.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Thamestunnel.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Thames Tunnel](/wiki/Thames_Tunnel \"Thames Tunnel\") (opened 1843).  \n[Cement](/wiki/Cement \"Cement\") was used in the world's first underwater\ntunnel.\n\nIn 1824 [Joseph Aspdin](/wiki/Joseph_Aspdin \"Joseph Aspdin\"), a British\n[bricklayer](/wiki/Bricklayer \"Bricklayer\") turned builder, patented a\nchemical process for making [portland cement](/wiki/Portland_cement \"Portland\ncement\") which was an important advance in the building trades.

Though others made a similar\ninnovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this was the work of\n[William Murdoch](/wiki/William_Murdoch \"William Murdoch\"), an employee of\nBoulton & Watt, the [Birmingham](/wiki/Birmingham \"Birmingham\") [steam\nengine](/wiki/Watt_steam_engine \"Watt steam engine\") pioneers. The process\nconsisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the\npurification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons),\nand its storage and distribution. The first gas lighting utilities were\nestablished in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major\nconsumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial\norganisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer\nthan with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to\nflourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a\nlarger scale than before.\n\n### Glass making\n\nMain article: [Glass production](/wiki/Glass_production \"Glass production\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Crystal_Palace_interior.jpg/220px-\nCrystal_Palace_interior.jpg)](/wiki/File:Crystal_Palace_interior.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Crystal_Palace_interior.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Crystal Palace held the [Great Exhibition](/wiki/The_Great_Exhibition \"The\nGreat Exhibition\") of 1851\n\nA new method of producing glass, known as the [cylinder\nprocess](/wiki/Cylinder_blown_sheet_glass \"Cylinder blown sheet glass\"), was\ndeveloped in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process was\nused by the [Chance Brothers](/wiki/Chance_Brothers \"Chance Brothers\") to\ncreate sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate\nglass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created\nwithout interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well\nas the fenestration of buildings. [The Crystal\nPalace](/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace \"The Crystal Palace\") is the supreme example\nof the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.\n\n### Paper machine\n\nMain article: [Paper machine](/wiki/Paper_machine \"Paper machine\")\n\nA machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was\npatented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for [Saint-Léger\nDidot](/wiki/Saint-L%C3%A9ger_Didot \"Saint-Léger Didot\") family in France. The\npaper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers Sealy\nand [Henry Fourdrinier](/wiki/Henry_Fourdrinier \"Henry Fourdrinier\"), who were\n[stationers](/wiki/Stationers \"Stationers\") in London. Although greatly\nimproved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant\nmeans of paper production today.\n\nThe method of [continuous production](/wiki/Continuous_production \"Continuous\nproduction\") demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of\ncontinuous rolling of iron and later steel and other [continuous\nproduction](/wiki/Continuous_production \"Continuous production\")\nprocesses.[58]\n\n### Agriculture\n\nMain article: [British Agricultural\nRevolution](/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution \"British Agricultural\nRevolution\")\n\nThe [British Agricultural Revolution](/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution\n\"British Agricultural Revolution\") is considered one of the causes of the\nIndustrial Revolution because improved agricultural productivity freed up\nworkers to work in other sectors of the economy.[59] However, per-capita food\nsupply in Europe was stagnant or delining and did not improve in some parts of\nEurope until the late 18th century.[60]\n\nIndustrial technologies that affected farming included the [seed\ndrill](/wiki/Seed_drill \"Seed drill\"), the [Dutch\nplough](/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution#The_Dutch_and_Rotherham_swing_.28wheel-\nless.29_plough \"British Agricultural Revolution\"), which contained iron parts,\nand the threshing machine.\n\n[Jethro Tull](/wiki/Jethro_Tull_\\(agriculturist\\) \"Jethro Tull\n\\(agriculturist\\)\") invented an improved seed drill in 1701. It was a\nmechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and\nplanted them at the correct depth. This was important because the yield of\nseeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five. Tull's\nseed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have\nmuch of an impact. Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid\n18th century.[61]\n\nJoseph Foljambe's _Rotherham[plough](/wiki/Plough \"Plough\")_ of 1730 was the\nfirst commercially successful iron plough.[62][63][64][65] The [threshing\nmachine](/wiki/Threshing_machine \"Threshing machine\"), invented by [Andrew\nMeikle](/wiki/Andrew_Meikle \"Andrew Meikle\") in 1784, displaced hand threshing\nwith a [flail](/wiki/Flail \"Flail\"), a laborious job that took about one-\nquarter of agricultural labour.[66]:286 It took several decades to diffuse[67]\nand was the final straw for many farm labourers, who faced near starvation,\nleading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the [Swing\nRiots](/wiki/Swing_Riots \"Swing Riots\").\n\n[Machine tools](/wiki/Machine_tools \"Machine tools\") and metalworking\ntechniques developed during the Industrial Revolution eventually resulted in\nprecision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for mass-producing\nagricultural equipment, such as reapers, binders and combine harvesters.[52]\n\n### Mining\n\n[Coal mining](/wiki/History_of_coal_mining \"History of coal mining\") in\nBritain, particularly in [South Wales](/wiki/South_Wales \"South Wales\"),\nstarted early. Before the steam engine, [pits](/wiki/Open-pit_mining \"Open-pit\nmining\") were often shallow [bell pits](/wiki/Bell_pit \"Bell pit\") following a\nseam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was\nextracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined\nby means of an [adit](/wiki/Adit \"Adit\") or [drift mine](/wiki/Drift_mining\n\"Drift mining\") driven into the side of a hill. [Shaft\nmining](/wiki/Shaft_mining \"Shaft mining\") was done in some areas, but the\nlimiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling\nbuckets of water up the shaft or to a [sough](/wiki/Sough \"Sough\") (a tunnel\ndriven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be\ndischarged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by\ngravity. The introduction of the steam pump by [Savery](/wiki/Savery \"Savery\")\nin 1698 and the [Newcomen steam engine](/wiki/Newcomen_steam_engine \"Newcomen\nsteam engine\") in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled\nshafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were\ndevelopments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption\nof [John Smeaton](/wiki/John_Smeaton \"John Smeaton\")'s improvements to the\nNewcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the\n1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable. The\n[Cornish engine](/wiki/Cornish_engine \"Cornish engine\"), developed in the\n1810s, was much more efficient than the [Watt Steam\nengine](/w/index.php?title=Watt_Steam_engine&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Watt Steam\nengine \\(page does not exist\\)\").\n\nCoal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of\n[firedamp](/wiki/Firedamp \"Firedamp\") in many coal seams. Some degree of\nsafety was provided by the [safety lamp](/wiki/Safety_lamp \"Safety lamp\")\nwhich was invented in 1816 by Sir [Humphry Davy](/wiki/Humphry_Davy \"Humphry\nDavy\") and independently by [George Stephenson](/wiki/George_Stephenson\n\"George Stephenson\"). However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they\nbecame unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. Firedamp explosions\ncontinued, often setting off [coal dust](/wiki/Coal_dust \"Coal dust\")\n[explosions](/wiki/Explosion \"Explosion\"), so casualties grew during the\nentire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty\nrate from rock falls.\n\n### Other developments\n\nOther developments included more efficient [water wheels](/wiki/Water_wheel\n\"Water wheel\"), based on experiments conducted by the British engineer [John\nSmeaton](/wiki/John_Smeaton \"John Smeaton\")[68] the beginnings of a machine\nindustry[17][69] and the rediscovery of [concrete](/wiki/Concrete \"Concrete\")\n(based on [hydraulic lime mortar](/wiki/Lime_mortar \"Lime mortar\")) by [John\nSmeaton](/wiki/John_Smeaton \"John Smeaton\"), which had been lost for 1300\nyears.[70]\n\n### Transportation\n\nMain article: [Transport during the British Industrial\nRevolution](/wiki/Transport_during_the_British_Industrial_Revolution\n\"Transport during the British Industrial Revolution\")\n\nSee also: [Productivity improving technologies (economic history) §\nInfrastructures](/wiki/Productivity_improving_technologies_\\(economic_history\\)#Infrastructures\n\"Productivity improving technologies \\(economic history\\)\")\n\nAt the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by\nnavigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods\nby sea. Wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further\nshipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. Animals supplied all\nof the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.\nThe first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century,\nwith steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th\ncentury.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution improved Britain's transport infrastructure with a\nturnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network.\nRaw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply\nthan before. Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.\n\n#### Canals\n\nMain article: [History of the British canal\nsystem](/wiki/History_of_the_British_canal_system \"History of the British\ncanal system\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Barton-on-\nIrwell_11.05.02R.jpg/170px-Barton-on-Irwell_11.05.02R.jpg)](/wiki/File:Barton-\non-Irwell_11.05.02R.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Barton-on-Irwell_11.05.02R.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Bridgewater Canal](/wiki/Bridgewater_Canal \"Bridgewater Canal\"), famous\nbecause of its commercial success, crossing the [Manchester Ship\nCanal](/wiki/Manchester_Ship_Canal \"Manchester Ship Canal\"), one of the last\ncanals to be built.\n\nCanals were the first technology to allow bulk materials to be economically\ntransported long distances inland. This was because a horse could pull a barge\nwith a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a\ncart.[34][71]\n\nBuilding of canals dates to ancient times. The [Grand\nCanal](/wiki/Grand_Canal_\\(China\\) \"Grand Canal \\(China\\)\") in China, \"the\nworld's largest artificial waterway and oldest canal still in existence,\"\nparts of which were started between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, is 1,121\nmiles (1,804 km) long and links [Hangzhou](/wiki/Hangzhou \"Hangzhou\") with\nBeijing.[72]\n\nIn the UK, canals began to be built in the late 18th century to link the major\nmanufacturing centres across the country. Known for its huge commercial\nsuccess, the [Bridgewater Canal](/wiki/Bridgewater_Canal \"Bridgewater Canal\")\nin [North West England](/wiki/North_West_England \"North West England\"), which\nopened in 1761 and was mostly funded by [The 3rd Duke of\nBridgewater](/wiki/Francis_Egerton,_3rd_Duke_of_Bridgewater \"Francis Egerton,\n3rd Duke of Bridgewater\"). From [Worsley](/wiki/Worsley \"Worsley\") to the\nrapidly growing town of [Manchester](/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\") its\nconstruction cost £168,000 (£22,589,130 as of\n2013[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Industrial_Revolution&action=edit)),[73][74]\nbut its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of\nits opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half.[75]\nThis success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as\n[Canal Mania](/wiki/Canal_Mania \"Canal Mania\").[76] New canals were hastily\nbuilt in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the Bridgewater\nCanal, the most notable being the [Leeds and Liverpool\nCanal](/wiki/Leeds_and_Liverpool_Canal \"Leeds and Liverpool Canal\") and the\n[Thames and Severn Canal](/wiki/Thames_and_Severn_Canal \"Thames and Severn\nCanal\") which opened in 1774 and 1789 respectively.\n\nBy the 1820s a national network was in existence. Canal construction served as\na model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways.\nThey were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises\nby the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. The last major canal to be\nbuilt in the United Kingdom was the [Manchester Ship\nCanal](/wiki/Manchester_Ship_Canal \"Manchester Ship Canal\"), which upon\nopening in 1894 was the largest [ship canal](/wiki/Ship_canal \"Ship canal\") in\nthe world,[77] and opened Manchester as a [port](/wiki/Port_of_Manchester\n\"Port of Manchester\"). However it never achieved the commercial success its\nsponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an\nage dominated by railways, which were quicker and often cheaper.\n\nBritain's canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of\nthe most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in\nBritain.\n\n#### Roads\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Rakeman_%E2%80%93_First_American_Macadam_Road.jpg/220px-\nRakeman_%E2%80%93_First_American_Macadam_Road.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rakeman_%E2%80%93_First_American_Macadam_Road.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rakeman_%E2%80%93_First_American_Macadam_Road.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nConstruction of the first macadam road in the United States (1823). In the\nforeground, workers are breaking stones \"so as not to exceed 6 ounces in\nweight or to pass a two-inch ring\".[78]\n\nMuch of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of\nlocal parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier)\n[turnpike](/wiki/Toll_road \"Toll road\") trusts were set up to charge tolls and\nmaintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the\n1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the\nresponsibility of a [turnpike trust](/wiki/Turnpike_trusts \"Turnpike trusts\").\nNew engineered roads were built by [John\nMetcalf](/wiki/John_Metcalf_\\(civil_engineer\\) \"John Metcalf \\(civil\nengineer\\)\"), [Thomas Telford](/wiki/Thomas_Telford \"Thomas Telford\") and most\nnotably [John McAdam](/wiki/John_Loudon_McAdam \"John Loudon McAdam\"), with the\nfirst '[macadamised](/wiki/Macadam \"Macadam\")' stretch of road being Marsh\nRoad at Ashton Gate, Bristol in 1816.[79] The major turnpikes radiated from\nLondon and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest\nof the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow,\nbroad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by\nsmaller carts or by teams of [pack horse](/wiki/Packhorse \"Packhorse\"). Stage\ncoaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on [carriers\ncarts](/wiki/Un-sprung_cart \"Un-sprung cart\").\n\n#### Railways\n\nMain article: [History of rail transport in Great\nBritain](/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_Great_Britain \"History of rail\ntransport in Great Britain\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Opening_Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.jpg/220px-\nOpening_Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.jpg)](/wiki/File:Opening_Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Opening_Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPainting depicting the [opening of the Liverpool and Manchester\nRailway](/wiki/Opening_of_the_Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway \"Opening of the\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway\") in 1830, the first inter-city railway in\nthe world and which spawned [Railway Mania](/wiki/Railway_Mania \"Railway\nMania\") due to its success.\n\nReducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads\ncompared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden\ntramway in 1805 at Croydon, England.\n\n> “ A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or\n> one ton. A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that\n> the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular\n> demonstration. Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon\n> weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together. A horse was then\n> attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having\n> stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well\n> as drawing his great load.”[80]\n\nRailways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive\n[puddled iron](/wiki/Puddling_\\(metallurgy\\) \"Puddling \\(metallurgy\\)\") after\n1800, the [rolling mill](/wiki/Rolling_\\(metalworking\\) \"Rolling\n\\(metalworking\\)\") for making rails, and the development of the high pressure\nsteam engine also around 1800.\n\nWagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century\nand were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement\nof coal. These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary\nsteam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first\napplications of the steam [locomotive](/wiki/Locomotive \"Locomotive\") were on\nwagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates\nused). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the\n19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were\nlowering costs. See: [Metallurgy](/wiki/Industrial_Revolution#Metallurgy\n\"Industrial Revolution\")\n\nSteam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high pressure\nsteam engines after the expiration of the [Boulton and\nWatt](/wiki/Boulton_and_Watt \"Boulton and Watt\") patent in 1800. High pressure\nengines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere, doing away with the condenser\nand cooling water. They were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for\na given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines. A few of these\nearly locomotives were used in mines. Steam-hauled public railways began with\nthe [Stockton and Darlington Railway](/wiki/Stockton_and_Darlington_Railway\n\"Stockton and Darlington Railway\") in 1825.\n\nThe rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 [Rainhill\nTrials](/wiki/Rainhill_Trials \"Rainhill Trials\"), which demonstrated [Robert\nStephenson](/wiki/Robert_Stephenson \"Robert Stephenson\")'s successful\nlocomotive design and the 1828 development of [Hot blast](/wiki/Hot_blast \"Hot\nblast\"), which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and\nincreased the capacity the [blast furnace](/wiki/Blast_furnace \"Blast\nfurnace\").\n\nOn 15 September 1830, the [Liverpool and Manchester\nRailway](/wiki/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway \"Liverpool and Manchester\nRailway\") was opened, the first inter-city railway in the world and was\nattended by Prime Minister, the [Duke of\nWellington](/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington \"Arthur Wellesley,\n1st Duke of Wellington\").[81] The railway was engineered by [Joseph\nLocke](/wiki/Joseph_Locke \"Joseph Locke\") and [George\nStephenson](/wiki/George_Stephenson \"George Stephenson\"), linked the rapidly\nexpanding industrial town of [Manchester](/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\") with\nthe port town of [Liverpool](/wiki/Liverpool \"Liverpool\"). The\n[opening](/wiki/Opening_of_the_Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway \"Opening of\nthe Liverpool and Manchester Railway\") was marred by problems, due to the\nprimitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were\ngradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting\npassengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in\nthe transport of freight and commodities, led to [Railway\nMania](/wiki/Railway_Mania \"Railway Mania\").\n\nConstruction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in\nthe 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial\nRevolution. After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not\nreturn to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing\nadditional workers for the factories.\n\n## Social effects\n\nMain article: [Life in Great Britain during the Industrial\nRevolution](/wiki/Life_in_Great_Britain_during_the_Industrial_Revolution \"Life\nin Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution\")\n\n### Factory system\n\nMain article: [Factory system](/wiki/Factory_system \"Factory system\")\n\nPrior to the Industrial Revolution most of the workforce was employed in\nagriculture, either as self-employed farmers as land owners or tenants, or as\nlandless agricultural labourers. It was common for families in various parts\nof the world to spin yarn, weave cloth and make their own clothing. Households\nalso spun and wove for market production. At the beginning of the Industrial\nRevolution India, China and regions of Iraq and elsewhere in Asia and the\nMiddle East produced most of the world's cotton cloth while Europeans produced\nwool and linen goods.\n\nIn Britain by the 16th century the [putting-out system](/wiki/Putting-\nout_system \"Putting-out system\"), by which farmers and townspeople produced\ngoods for market in their homes, often described as _cottage industry_ , was\nbeing practiced. Typical putting out system goods included spinning and\nweaving. Merchant capitalist typically provided the raw materials, paid\nworkers by the [piece](/wiki/Piece_work \"Piece work\"), and were responsible\nfor the sale of the goods. Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor\nquality were common problems. The logistical effort in procuring and\ndistributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations\nof the putting out system.[82]\n\nSome early spinning and weaving machinery, such as a [40 spindle\njenny](/wiki/Spinning_jenny \"Spinning jenny\") for about six pounds in 1792,\nwas affordable for cottagers.[83] Later machinery such as spinning frames,\n[spinning mules](/wiki/Spinning_mule \"Spinning mule\") and power looms were\nexpensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership\nof factories.\n\nThe majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were\nunmarried women and children, including many orphans. They typically worked\nfor 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off. It was common for women take\nfactory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work. Lack of adequate\ntransportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and\nmaintain workers.[84] Many workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural\nworkers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out\nof necessity. (See: [British Agricultural\nRevolution](/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution \"British Agricultural\nRevolution\"), [Threshing machine](/wiki/Threshing_machine \"Threshing\nmachine\"))\n\nThe change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to\nfarmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by [Karl Marx](/wiki/Karl_Marx\n\"Karl Marx\"), however, he recognized the increase in productivity made\npossible by technology.[85]\n\n### Impact on women and family life\n\nWomen's historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and\ncapitalism generally on the status of women.[86][87] Taking a pessimistic\nside, [Alice Clark](/wiki/Alice_Clark \"Alice Clark\") argued that when\ncapitalism arrived in 17th century England, it lowered the status of women as\nthey lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th century\nEngland, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The\nhome was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running\nfarms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave\nthem a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as\ncapitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of\nlabour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home, and the wife\nreduced to unpaid household work. Middle- and upper-class women were confined\nto an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were\nforced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect\non powerful women.[88]\n\nIn a more positive interpretation, [Ivy Pinchbeck](/wiki/Ivy_Pinchbeck \"Ivy\nPinchbeck\") argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's\nemancipation.[89] Tilly and Scott have emphasised the continuity in the status\nof women, finding three stages in English history. In the pre-industrial era,\nproduction was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the\nhouseholds. The second stage was the \"family wage economy\" of early\nindustrialisation; the entire family depended on the collective wages of its\nmembers, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage\nis the \"family consumer economy,\" in which the family is the site of\nconsumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical\njobs to support rising standards of consumption.[90]\n\n### Standards of living\n\nSome economists, such as [Robert E. Lucas, Jr.](/wiki/Robert_Lucas,_Jr.\n\"Robert Lucas, Jr.\"), say that the real impact of the Industrial Revolution\nwas that \"for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of\nordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth ... Nothing remotely\nlike this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as\na theoretical possibility.\"[5] Others, however, argue that while growth of the\neconomy's overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial\nRevolution, living standards for the majority of the population did not grow\nmeaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries, and that in many ways\nworkers' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance,\nstudies have shown that real wages in Britain only increased 15% between the\n1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to\ndramatically increase until the 1870s.[6][7]\n\nThe effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very\ncontroversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from\nthe 1950s to the 1980s.[91] A series of 1950s essays by [Henry Phelps\nBrown](/wiki/Henry_Phelps_Brown \"Henry Phelps Brown\") and Sheila V. Hopkins\nlater set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at\nthe bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living\nstandards.[91] During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker\nwages.[92][93][94]\n\n#### Food and nutrition\n\nMain article: [British Agricultural\nRevolution](/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution \"British Agricultural\nRevolution\")\n\nChronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the\npopulation of the world including Britain and France, until the late 19th\ncentury. Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy\nin France was about 35 years and about 40 years in Britain. The United States\npopulation of the time was adequately fed, much taller on average and had life\nexpectancy of 45–50 years although U.S. life expectancy declined a few years\nby the mid 18th century.[95]\n\nThe initial technologies of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized\ntextiles, iron and coal, did little, if anything, to lower food prices.[96] In\nBritain and the Netherlands, food supply increased before the Industrial\nRevolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population grew too,\nas noted by [Thomas Malthus](/wiki/Thomas_Malthus \"Thomas\nMalthus\").[24][66][97][98] This condition is called the [Malthusian\ntrap](/wiki/Malthusian_trap \"Malthusian trap\"), and it finally started to\novercome by transportation improvements, such as canals, improved roads and\nsteamships. [99] Railroads and steamships were introduced near the end of the\nIndustrial Revolution.[66]\n\n#### Housing\n\nThe very rapid growth in population in the 19th century in the cities included\nthe new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centers such\nas Edinburgh and London.[100] The critical factor was financing, which was\nhandled by building societies that dealt directly with large contracting\nfirms.[101][102] Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant\ntenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants.[103] People\nmoved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate\nhousing for everyone, so low income newcomers squeezed into increasingly\novercrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were\ninadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and\ntuberculosis among young adults. [Cholera](/wiki/Cholera \"Cholera\") from\npolluted water and typhoid were endemic. Unlike rural areas, there were no\nfamines such as devastated Ireland in the 1840s.[104][105][106]\n\nA large exposé literature grew up condemning the unhealthy conditions. By far\nthe most famous publication was by one of the founders of the Socialist\nmovement, _[The Condition of the Working Class in\nEngland](/wiki/The_Condition_of_the_Working_Class_in_England \"The Condition of\nthe Working Class in England\")_ in 1844 [Friedrich\nEngels](/wiki/Friedrich_Engels \"Friedrich Engels\") described backstreet\nsections of Manchester and other mill towns, where people lived in crude\nshanties and shacks, some not completely enclosed, some with dirt floors.\nThese shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and\ndwellings. There were no sanitary facilities. Population density was extremely\nhigh.[107] Not everyone lived in such poor conditions. The Industrial\nRevolution also created a middle class of businessmen, clerks, foremen and\nengineers who lived in much better conditions.\n\nConditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public\nhealth acts regulating things such as sewage, hygiene and home construction.\nIn the introduction of his 1892 edition, Engels notes that most of the\nconditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved. For example, the\n[Public Health Act 1875](/wiki/Public_Health_Act_1875 \"Public Health Act\n1875\") led to the more sanitary [byelaw terraced\nhouse](/wiki/Byelaw_terraced_house \"Byelaw terraced house\").\n\n#### Clothing and consumer goods\n\nConsumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles\nsuch as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for\ncooking and space heating. Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and\ngrowth in wealth of the middle classes in Britain, Wedgwood created goods such\nas [tableware](/wiki/Tableware \"Tableware\"), which was starting to become a\ncommon feature on dining tables.[108]\n\n### Population increase\n\nAccording to Robert Hughes in _The Fatal Shore_ , the [population of\nEngland](/wiki/Demography_of_England \"Demography of England\") and Wales, which\nhad remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after\n1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801\nto 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5\nmillion.[109] Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing\nfrom 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s.[110][111] Europe's population\nincreased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.[112]\n\nThe Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there\nwas a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income.[113]\n\n### Labour conditions\n\n#### Social structure and working conditions\n\nIn terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph\nof a [middle class](/wiki/Middle_class \"Middle class\") of industrialists and\nbusinessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working\npeople found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and\nfactories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long\nhours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900,\nmost industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12\nhours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum\ndeemed necessary for a decent life;[114] however, most workers in textiles,\nwhich was by far the leading industry in terms of employment, were women and\nchildren.[31] Also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the\nIndustrial Revolution took place. [Pre-industrial society](/wiki/Pre-\nindustrial_society \"Pre-industrial society\") was very static and often cruel –\n[child labour](/wiki/Child_labour \"Child labour\"), dirty living conditions,\nand long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial\nRevolution.[115]\n\n#### Factories and urbanisation\n\nMain article: [Factory system](/wiki/Factory_system \"Factory system\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Cottonopolis1.jpg/220px-\nCottonopolis1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cottonopolis1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cottonopolis1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nManchester, England (\"[Cottonopolis](/wiki/Cottonopolis \"Cottonopolis\")\"),\npictured in 1840, showing the mass of factory chimneys\n\nIndustrialisation led to the creation of the [factory](/wiki/Factory\n\"Factory\"). The factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas, as\nlarge numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the\nfactories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated\nindustries of Manchester, nicknamed \"[Cottonopolis](/wiki/Cottonopolis\n\"Cottonopolis\")\", and the world's first industrial city.[116] Manchester\nexperienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831.\nBradford grew by 50% every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only\n50% of the population of Bradford was actually born there.[117]\n\nFor much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were\ntypically [water-powered](/wiki/List_of_watermills_in_the_United_Kingdom \"List\nof watermills in the United Kingdom\") and built to serve local needs. Later,\neach factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an\nefficient draft through its boiler.\n\nIn other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive.\nSome industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions\nfor their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was [Robert\nOwen](/wiki/Robert_Owen \"Robert Owen\"), known for his pioneering efforts in\nimproving conditions for workers at the [New Lanark\nmills](/wiki/Robert_Owen#Philanthropy_in_New_Lanark_.281800.29 \"Robert Owen\"),\nand often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the [early socialist\nmovement](/wiki/Utopian_socialism \"Utopian socialism\").\n\nBy 1746 an integrated [brass mill](/wiki/Brass_mill \"Brass mill\") was working\nat [Warmley](/wiki/Warmley \"Warmley\") near [Bristol](/wiki/Bristol \"Bristol\").\nRaw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into\npans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site.\n[Josiah Wedgwood](/wiki/Josiah_Wedgwood \"Josiah Wedgwood\") and [Matthew\nBoulton](/wiki/Matthew_Boulton \"Matthew Boulton\") (whose [Soho\nManufactory](/wiki/Soho_Manufactory \"Soho Manufactory\") was completed in 1766)\nwere other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.\n\n#### Child labour\n\nSee also: [Child labour § The Industrial\nRevolution](/wiki/Child_labour#The_Industrial_Revolution \"Child labour\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Coaltub.png)](/wiki/File:Coaltub.png)\n\nA young \"drawer\" pulling a coal tub along a mine gallery.[118] In Britain laws\npassed in 1842 and 1844 improved mine working conditions.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution led to a population increase but the chances of\nsurviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution,\nalthough _infant_ mortality rates were reduced markedly.[119][120] There was\nstill limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work.\nEmployers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity\nwas comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial\nmachine, and since the industrial system was completely new, there were no\nexperienced adult labourers. This made child labour the labour of choice for\nmanufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the\n18th and 19th centuries. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the\nworkers in 143 water-powered [cotton mills](/wiki/Cotton_mill \"Cotton mill\")\nwere described as children.[121]\n\n[Child labour](/wiki/Child_labour \"Child labour\") existed before the\nIndustrial Revolution but with the increase in population and education it\nbecame more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad\nconditions for much lower pay than their elders,[122] 10–20% of an adult\nmale's wage.[123] Children as young as four were employed.[123] Beatings and\nlong hours were common, with some child [coal miners](/wiki/Coal_mine \"Coal\nmine\") and [hurriers](/wiki/Hurrying \"Hurrying\") working from 4 am until 5\npm.[123] Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they dozed\noff and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas\nexplosions.[123] Many children developed [lung cancer](/wiki/Lung_cancer \"Lung\ncancer\") and other diseases and died before the age of 25.[123]\n[Workhouses](/wiki/Workhouses \"Workhouses\") would sell orphans and abandoned\nchildren as \"pauper apprentices\", working without wages for board and\nlodging.[123] Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their\nmasters, with some masters [shackling](/wiki/Shackle \"Shackle\") them to\nprevent escape.[123] Children employed as [mule\nscavengers](/wiki/Mule_scavenger \"Mule scavenger\") by [cotton\nmills](/wiki/Cotton_mill \"Cotton mill\") would crawl under machinery to pick up\ncotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs,\nothers were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated.[123] Young\ngirls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to\ndevelop [phossy jaw](/wiki/Phossy_jaw \"Phossy jaw\").[123] Children employed at\n[glassworks](/wiki/Glassblowing \"Glassblowing\") were regularly burned and\nblinded, and those working at [potteries](/wiki/Pottery \"Pottery\") were\nvulnerable to poisonous clay dust.[123]\n\nReports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal\nmines[124] and textile factories,[125] and these helped to popularise the\nchildren's plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle\nclasses, helped stir change in the young workers' welfare.\n\nPoliticians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory\nowners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their\nchildren money to buy food to avoid [starvation](/wiki/Starvation\n\"Starvation\"), and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844,\nthe first general laws against child labour, the [Factory\nActs](/wiki/Factory_Acts \"Factory Acts\"), were passed in Britain: Children\nyounger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to\nwork at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to\ntwelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law, however,\ntheir scarcity made enforcement difficult.[123] About ten years later, the\nemployment of children and women in mining was forbidden. These laws decreased\nthe number of child labourers, however child labour remained in Europe and the\nUnited States up to the 20th century.[126]\n\n#### Organisation of labour\n\nSee also: [Trade union § History](/wiki/Trade_union#History \"Trade union\")\n\nThe Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines,\nthus facilitating the organisation of _combinations_ or [trade\nunions](/wiki/Trade_union \"Trade union\") to help advance the interests of\nworking people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing\nall labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to\ndecide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or\nsuffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to\nreplace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their\nconditions through this kind of bargaining.\n\nThe main method the unions used to effect change was [strike\naction](/wiki/Strike_action \"Strike action\"). Many strikes were painful events\nfor both sides, the unions and the management. In Britain, the [Combination\nAct 1799](/wiki/Combination_Act_1799 \"Combination Act 1799\") forbade workers\nto form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. Even after this,\nunions were still severely restricted.\n\nIn 1832, the [Reform Act](/wiki/Reform_Act_1832 \"Reform Act 1832\") extended\nthe vote in Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men\nfrom [Tolpuddle](/wiki/Tolpuddle \"Tolpuddle\") in Dorset founded the Friendly\nSociety of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of\nwages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week,\nalthough by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and\nwere due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local\nlandowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, [Lord\nMelbourne](/wiki/Viscount_Melbourne \"Viscount Melbourne\"), to complain about\nthe union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing\noaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James\nBrine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George's brother James Loveless,\nGeorge's brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas's son John Standfield\nwere arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known\nas the [Tolpuddle Martyrs](/wiki/Tolpuddle_Martyrs \"Tolpuddle Martyrs\"). In\nthe 1830s and 1840s, the [Chartist](/wiki/Chartism \"Chartism\") movement was\nthe first large-scale organised working class political movement which\ncampaigned for political equality and social justice. Its _Charter_ of reforms\nreceived over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without\nconsideration.\n\nWorking people also formed [friendly societies](/wiki/Friendly_society\n\"Friendly society\") and [co-operative societies](/wiki/Cooperative\n\"Cooperative\") as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship.\nEnlightened industrialists, such as [Robert Owen](/wiki/Robert_Owen \"Robert\nOwen\") also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the\nworking class.\n\nUnions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842,\na [general strike](/wiki/General_strike \"General strike\") involving cotton\nworkers and colliers was organised through the Chartist movement which stopped\nproduction across Great Britain.[127]\n\nEventually, effective political organisation for working people was achieved\nthrough the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867\nand 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to\nbecome the British [Labour Party](/wiki/Labour_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Labour Party\n\\(UK\\)\").\n\n#### Luddites\n\nMain article: [Luddite](/wiki/Luddite \"Luddite\")\n\n[![Refer to\ncaption](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/FrameBreaking-1812.jpg/220px-\nFrameBreaking-1812.jpg)](/wiki/File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLuddites smashing a power loom in 1812\n\nThe rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers\ntheir jobs. The movement started first with [lace](/wiki/Lace \"Lace\") and\n[hosiery](/wiki/Hosiery \"Hosiery\") workers near [Nottingham](/wiki/Nottingham\n\"Nottingham\") and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early\nindustrialisation. Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed\nsince they could no longer compete with machines which only required\nrelatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single\nweaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers and others, turned their\nanimosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying\nfactories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly\nfollowers of [Ned Ludd](/wiki/Ned_Ludd \"Ned Ludd\"), a folklore figure. The\nfirst attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly\ngained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the\n[militia](/wiki/Militia \"Militia\") or [army](/wiki/Army \"Army\") to protect\nindustry. Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or\n[transported](/wiki/Penal_transportation \"Penal transportation\") for life.\n\nUnrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised, such as with\nagricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were\naffected by the [Captain Swing](/wiki/Captain_Swing \"Captain Swing\")\ndisturbances. Threshing machines were a particular target, and\n[hayrick](/wiki/Hay \"Hay\") burning was a popular activity. However, the riots\nled to the first formation of [trade unions](/wiki/Trade_union \"Trade union\"),\nand further pressure for reform.\n\n#### Destruction of hand textile production in India, China, etc.\n\nThe traditional centers of hand textile production such as India, parts of the\nMiddle East and later China could not withstand the competition from machine\nmade textiles, which over a period of decades destroyed the hand made textile\nindustries and left millions of people without work, many of whom starved.[31]\n\n#### Effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery\n\nCheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton, which had\npreviously been consumed mostly in regions where it was grown, with little raw\ncotton available for export. Consequently, prices of raw cotton rose. At the\nbeginning of the Industrial Revolution cotton was grown in small plots in the\nOld World, leaving the Americas with the only place having much available land\nwith the potential for new cotton production. Some cotton had been grown in\nthe West Indies, particularly in Haiti, but Haitian cotton production was\nhalted by the [Haitian Revolution](/wiki/Haitian_Revolution \"Haitian\nRevolution\") in 1791. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 allowed Georgia\ngreen seeded cotton to be profitable, leading to widespread growth of cotton\nplantations in the United States and Brazil. (A cotton seed brought to Natchez\nin 1806 of _[Gossypium hirsutum](/wiki/Gossypium_hirsutum \"Gossypium\nhirsutum\")_ would be the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton\nproduction. It produced bowls that were three to four times faster to pick.)\nThe Americas, particularly the U.S., had labor shortages and high priced\nlabor, which made slavery attractive. America's cotton plantations were highly\nefficient and profitable, and were able to keep up with demand.[128] The U.S.\nCivil war created a \"cotton famine\" that lead to increased production in other\nareas of the world, including new colonies in Africa.\n\n### Impact on environment\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/StRolloxChemical_1831.jpg/220px-\nStRolloxChemical_1831.jpg)](/wiki/File:StRolloxChemical_1831.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:StRolloxChemical_1831.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLevels of air pollution rose during the Industrial Revolution, sparking the\nfirst modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing\nlevels of [smoke](/wiki/Smoke \"Smoke\") [pollution](/wiki/Pollution\n\"Pollution\") in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence\nof great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [coal\nconsumption](/wiki/History_of_coal_mining \"History of coal mining\") gave rise\nto an unprecedented level of [air pollution](/wiki/Air_pollution \"Air\npollution\") in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial\n[chemical](/wiki/Chemical \"Chemical\") discharges added to the growing load of\nuntreated human waste.[129] The first large-scale, modern environmental laws\ncame in the form of Britain's [Alkali Acts](/wiki/Alkali_Acts \"Alkali Acts\"),\npassed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution\n([gaseous](/wiki/Gaseous \"Gaseous\") [hydrochloric\nacid](/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid \"Hydrochloric acid\")) given off by the [Leblanc\nprocess](/wiki/Leblanc_process \"Leblanc process\"), used to produce [soda\nash](/wiki/Soda_ash \"Soda ash\"). An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors\nwere appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the\ninspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958\nwhich placed all major heavy industries that emitted [smoke](/wiki/Smoke\n\"Smoke\"), grit, dust and fumes under supervision.\n\nThe manufactured gas industry began in British cities in 1812–1820. The\ntechnique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and\nrivers. The gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits. They\nusually lost and modified the worst practices. The City of London repeatedly\nindicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the Thames and poisoning its\nfish. Finally, Parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity.[130]\nThe industry reached the US around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits.[131]\n\nIn industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took\nthe lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and\ninitiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.[132] Typically\nthe highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [Coal Smoke\nAbatement Society](/wiki/Environmental_Protection_UK \"Environmental Protection\nUK\") was formed in Britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental\nNGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [William Blake\nRichmond](/wiki/William_Blake_Richmond \"William Blake Richmond\"), frustrated\nwith the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of\nlegislation, the [Public Health Act 1875](/wiki/Public_Health_Act_1875 \"Public\nHealth Act 1875\") required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own\nsmoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large\namounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with\nthe Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and\ngritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own\nregulations.[133]\n\n### Other effects\n\nThe application of steam power to the industrial processes of\n[printing](/wiki/Printing \"Printing\") supported a massive expansion of\nnewspaper and popular book publishing, which reinforced rising literacy and\ndemands for mass political participation.\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, the [life expectancy](/wiki/Life_expectancy\n\"Life expectancy\") of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the\nchildren born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5%\nin 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.[119]\n\nThe growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive\n[urbanisation](/wiki/Urbanisation \"Urbanisation\") and the rise of new great\ncities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities\nbrought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas. In\n1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities,[134] compared to\nnearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century).[135] Manchester had a\npopulation of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3\nmillion.[136]\n\n## Industrialisation beyond the United Kingdom\n\n### Continental Europe\n\nThe Industrial Revolution on [Continental Europe](/wiki/Continental_Europe\n\"Continental Europe\") came a little later than in Great Britain. In many\nindustries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain\nin new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British\nengineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By\n1809, part of the [Ruhr Valley](/wiki/Ruhr \"Ruhr\") in Westphalia was called\n'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of\nEngland. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state\nfunding to the new industries. In some cases (such as\n[iron](/wiki/Iron_and_steel_industry \"Iron and steel industry\")), the\ndifferent availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of\nthe British technology were adopted.\n\n#### Belgium\n\n[Belgium](/wiki/History_of_Belgium \"History of Belgium\") was the second\ncountry, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the\nfirst in continental Europe: [Wallonia](/wiki/Wallonia \"Wallonia\") (French\nspeaking southern Belgium) was the first region to follow the British model\nsuccessfully. Starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after\nBelgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke\nblast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal\nmining areas around [Liège](/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge \"Liège\") and\n[Charleroi](/wiki/Charleroi \"Charleroi\"). The leader was a transplanted\nEnglishman [John Cockerill](/wiki/John_Cockerill_\\(industrialist\\) \"John\nCockerill \\(industrialist\\)\"). His factories at [Seraing](/wiki/Seraing\n\"Seraing\") integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply\nof raw materials, as early as 1825.[137]\n\nWallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to\ncoal (the French word \"houille\" was coined in Wallonia),[138] the region\ngeared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain. But\nit is also pointed out by many researchers, with its _[Sillon\nindustriel](/wiki/Sillon_industriel \"Sillon industriel\")_ , 'Especially in the\n[Haine](/wiki/Haine \"Haine\"), [Sambre](/wiki/Sambre \"Sambre\") and\n[Meuse](/wiki/Meuse_\\(river\\) \"Meuse \\(river\\)\") valleys, between the\n[Borinage](/wiki/Borinage \"Borinage\") and [Liège](/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge \"Liège\"),\n(...) there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-\nmaking...'.[139] Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: \"It was\nnot propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second\nindustrial power all over the world after Britain.\"[140] \"The sole industrial\ncentre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth\nmaking town of [Ghent](/wiki/Ghent \"Ghent\").\"[141] Michel De Coster, Professor\nat the [Université de Liège](/wiki/University_of_Li%C3%A8ge \"University of\nLiège\") wrote also: \"The historians and the economists say that Belgium was\nthe second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and\nits territory (...) But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines,\nthe blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass\nindustry, the weapons industry... were concentrated.\" [142]\n\n##### Demographic effects\n\nWallonia was also the birthplace of a strong Socialist party and strong trade-\nunions in a particular sociological landscape. At the left, the _Sillon\nindustriel_ , which runs from [Mons](/wiki/Mons \"Mons\") in the west, to\n[Verviers](/wiki/Verviers \"Verviers\") in the east (except part of North\nFlanders, in another period of the industrial revolution, after 1920). Even if\nBelgium is the second industrial country after Britain, the effect of the\nindustrial revolution there was very different. In 'Breaking stereotypes',\nMuriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say:\n\n> The industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one,\n> but with a strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the\n> [Middle Ages](/wiki/Middle_Ages \"Middle Ages\") and the Early Modern Period,\n> Flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres (...) at\n> the beginning of the nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an\n> urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most\n> urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per\n> cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per\n> cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain.

Also, in\n> [Wallonia](/wiki/Wallonia \"Wallonia\") the traditional urban network was\n> largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the\n> proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and\n> 1910. Especially in the [Haine](/wiki/Haine \"Haine\"), [Sambre](/wiki/Sambre\n> \"Sambre\") and [Meuse](/wiki/Meuse_\\(river\\) \"Meuse \\(river\\)\") valleys,\n> between the [Borinage](/wiki/Borinage \"Borinage\") and\n> [Liège](/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge \"Liège\"), where there was a huge industrial\n> development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast.\n> During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000\n> inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating\n> nearly half of the Walloon population in this region.

Notably, most French\nhistorians argue France did not go through a clear _take-off_.[144] Instead,\nFrance's economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady\nthrough the 18th and 19th centuries. However, some stages were identified by\nMaurice Lévy-Leboyer:\n\n  * French Revolution and Napoleonic wars (1789–1815),\n  * industrialisation, along with Britain (1815–1860),\n  * economic slowdown (1860–1905),\n  * renewal of the growth after 1905.\n\n#### Germany\n\nMain article: [Economic history of Germany](/wiki/Economic_history_of_Germany\n\"Economic history of Germany\")\n\nBased on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and\nindustrial laboratories, Germany, which was unified in 1871, became dominant\nin the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century. At first the\nproduction of dyes based on [aniline](/wiki/Aniline \"Aniline\") was\ncritical.[145]\n\nGermany's political disunity – with three dozen states – and a pervasive\nconservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the\n1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each German state was responsible\nfor the lines within its own borders. Lacking a technological base at first,\nthe Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly\nlearned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities,\nthe new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and\ntraining, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands\nof railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth\nof the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their\nengineering was inferior to Britain's. However, German unification in 1870\nstimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and\nfurther rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of\nindustrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other\nindustrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of\nHamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000\npassengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of France[146]\n\n#### Sweden\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) | This section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

This led to economic growth benefiting large\nsections of the population and leading up to a _consumption revolution_\nstarting in the 1820s.\n\nDuring 1815–1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and\nlarger industries. This period witnessed increasing regional specialisation\nwith mining in [Bergslagen](/wiki/Bergslagen \"Bergslagen\"), textile mills in\nSjuhäradsbygden and forestry in [Norrland](/wiki/Norrland \"Norrland\"). Several\nimportant institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and\nmandatory schooling introduced 1842 (as first country in the world), the\nabolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846, and a\nstock company law in 1848.\n\nDuring 1850–1890, Sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export,\ndominated by crops, wood and steel. Sweden abolished most tariffs and other\nbarriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873.\n\nDuring 1890–1930, Sweden experienced the second industrial revolution. New\nindustries developed with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical\nengineering, power utilities, [papermaking](/wiki/Papermaking \"Papermaking\")\nand textile.\n\n### Japan\n\nMain articles: [Meiji Restoration](/wiki/Meiji_Restoration \"Meiji\nRestoration\") and [Economic history of Japan](/wiki/Economic_history_of_Japan\n\"Economic history of Japan\")\n\nThe industrial revolution began about 1870 as [Meiji\nperiod](/wiki/Meiji_period \"Meiji period\") leaders decided to catch up with\nthe West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a\nland reform programme to prepare the country for further development. It\ninaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent\nthousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than\n3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign\nlanguages in Japan ([Foreign government advisors in Meiji\nJapan](/wiki/Foreign_government_advisors_in_Meiji_Japan \"Foreign government\nadvisors in Meiji Japan\")).\n\nIn 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [Iwakura\nMission](/wiki/Iwakura_Mission \"Iwakura Mission\") toured Europe and the United\nStates to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led\nindustrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [Bank of\nJapan](/wiki/Bank_of_Japan \"Bank of Japan\"), founded in 1882,[147] used taxes\nto fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese\nstudents were sent to study in the west.\n\nModern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially\nsilk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.[148]\n\n### United States\n\nMain articles: [American system of\nmanufacturing](/wiki/American_system_of_manufacturing \"American system of\nmanufacturing\"), [Interchangeable parts](/wiki/Interchangeable_parts\n\"Interchangeable parts\"), [Economic history of the United\nStates](/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_States \"Economic history of the\nUnited States\"), [Technological and industrial history of the United\nStates](/wiki/Technological_and_industrial_history_of_the_United_States\n\"Technological and industrial history of the United States\"), and [Industrial\nRevolution in the United\nStates](/wiki/Industrial_Revolution_in_the_United_States \"Industrial\nRevolution in the United States\")\n\nSee also: [History of Lowell,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/History_of_Lowell,_Massachusetts \"History of Lowell,\nMassachusetts\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/SlaterMill.JPG/220px-\nSlaterMill.JPG)](/wiki/File:SlaterMill.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:SlaterMill.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nSlater's Mill\n\nDuring the late 18th an early 19th centuries when the UK and parts of Western\nEurope began to industrialise, the US was primarily an agricultural and\nnatural resource producing and processing economy.[149] The building of roads\nand canals, the introduction of steamboats and the building of railroads were\nimportant for handling agricultural and natural resource products in the large\nand sparsely populated country of the period.[150][151]\n\nImportant American technological contributions during the period of the\nIndustrial Revolution were the [cotton gin](/wiki/Cotton_gin \"Cotton gin\") and\nthe development of a system for making [interchangeable\nparts](/wiki/Interchangeable_parts \"Interchangeable parts\"), the latter aided\nby the development of the [milling machine](/wiki/Milling_\\(machining\\)\n\"Milling \\(machining\\)\") in the US. The development of machine tools and the\nsystem of interchangeable parts were the basis for the rise of the US as the\nworld's leading industrial nation in the late 19th century.\n\n[Oliver Evans](/wiki/Oliver_Evans \"Oliver Evans\") invented an automated flour\nmill in the mid 1780s that used [control mechanisms](/wiki/Process_control\n\"Process control\") and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time\ngrain was loaded into the elevator buckets until flour was discharged into a\nwagon. This is considered to be the first modern [materials handling\nsystem](/wiki/Bulk_material_handling \"Bulk material handling\") an important\nadvance in the progress toward [mass production](/wiki/Mass_production \"Mass\nproduction\").[52]\n\nThe United States originally used horse-powered machinery for small scale\napplications such as grain milling, but eventually switched to water power\nafter textile factories began being built in the 1790s. As a result,\nindustrialisation was concentrated in [New England](/wiki/New_England \"New\nEngland\") and the [Northeastern United\nStates](/wiki/Northeastern_United_States \"Northeastern United States\"), which\nhas fast-moving rivers. The newer water-powered production lines proved more\neconomical than horse-drawn production. In the late 19th century steam-powered\nmanufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to\nspread to the Midwest.\n\n[Thomas Somers](/wiki/Thomas_Somers \"Thomas Somers\") and the [Cabot\nBrothers](/wiki/Cabot_Brothers \"Cabot Brothers\") founded the [Beverly Cotton\nManufactory](/wiki/Beverly_Cotton_Manufactory \"Beverly Cotton Manufactory\") in\n1787, the first cotton mill in America, the largest cotton mill of its\nera,[152] and a significant milestone in the research and development of\ncotton mills in the future. This mill was designed to use horse power, but the\noperators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically\nunstable, and had economic losses for years. Despite the losses, the\nManufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large\namount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used\nin Slater's Mill.[153]\n\nIn 1793, [Samuel Slater](/wiki/Samuel_Slater \"Samuel Slater\") (1768–1835)\nfounded the [Slater Mill](/wiki/Slater_Mill \"Slater Mill\") at [Pawtucket,\nRhode Island](/wiki/Pawtucket,_Rhode_Island \"Pawtucket, Rhode Island\"). He had\nlearned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in\n[Derbyshire](/wiki/Derbyshire \"Derbyshire\"), England, and defied laws against\nthe emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to\nmake money with his knowledge. After founding Slater's Mill, he went on to own\n13 textile mills.[154] [Daniel Day](/wiki/Daniel_Day_\\(manufacturer\\) \"Daniel\nDay \\(manufacturer\\)\") established a wool carding mill in the [Blackstone\nValley](/wiki/Blackstone_Valley \"Blackstone Valley\") at [Uxbridge,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Uxbridge,_Massachusetts \"Uxbridge, Massachusetts\") in\n1809, the third woollen mill established in the US (The first was in\n[Hartford, Connecticut](/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut \"Hartford, Connecticut\"),\nand the second at [Watertown, Massachusetts](/wiki/Watertown,_Massachusetts\n\"Watertown, Massachusetts\").) The [John H. Chafee](/wiki/John_Chafee \"John\nChafee\") [Blackstone River Valley National Heritage\nCorridor](/wiki/Blackstone_Valley \"Blackstone Valley\") retraces the history of\n\"America's Hardest-Working River', the Blackstone. The [Blackstone\nRiver](/wiki/Blackstone_River \"Blackstone River\") and its tributaries, which\ncover more than 45 miles (72 km) from [Worcester,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts \"Worcester, Massachusetts\") to\n[Providence, Rhode Island](/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island \"Providence, Rhode\nIsland\"), was the birthplace of America's Industrial Revolution. At its peak\nover 1100 mills operated in this valley, including Slater's mill, and with it\nthe earliest beginnings of America's Industrial and Technological Development.\n\n[Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell](/wiki/Francis_Cabot_Lowell_\\(businessman\\)\n\"Francis Cabot Lowell \\(businessman\\)\") from [Newburyport,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Newburyport,_Massachusetts \"Newburyport, Massachusetts\")\nmemorised the design of textile machines on his tour of British factories in\n1810. Realising that the [War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\") had\nruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was\nemerging in America, on his return to the United States, he set up the [Boston\nManufacturing Company](/wiki/Boston_Manufacturing_Company \"Boston\nManufacturing Company\"). Lowell and his partners built America's second\ncotton-to-cloth textile mill at [Waltham,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Waltham,_Massachusetts \"Waltham, Massachusetts\"), second\nto the [Beverly Cotton Manufactory](/wiki/Beverly_Cotton_Manufactory \"Beverly\nCotton Manufactory\"). After his death in 1817, his associates built America's\nfirst planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was\ncapitalised in a [public stock offering](/wiki/Initial_public_offering\n\"Initial public offering\"), one of the first uses of it in the United States.\n[Lowell, Massachusetts](/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts \"Lowell, Massachusetts\"),\nusing 5.6 miles (9.0 km) of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the\n[Merrimack River](/wiki/Merrimack_River \"Merrimack River\"), is considered by\nsome as a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial\nRevolution. The short-lived utopia-like [Waltham-Lowell system](/wiki/Waltham-\nLowell_system \"Waltham-Lowell system\") was formed, as a direct response to the\npoor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the\n[Irish Potato Famine](/wiki/Great_Famine_\\(Ireland\\) \"Great Famine\n\\(Ireland\\)\"), the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.\n\nA major U.S. contribution to industrialization was the development of\ntechniques to make [interchangeable parts](/wiki/Interchangeable_parts\n\"Interchangeable parts\") from metal. Precision metal machining techniques were\ndeveloped by the U.S. Department of War to make interchangeable parts for\nsmall firearms. The development work took place at the Federal Arsenals at\nSpringfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory. Techniques for precision\nmachining using machine tools included using fixtures to hold the parts in\nproper position, jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and\ngauges to measure the accuracy. The [milling machine](/wiki/Milling_machine\n\"Milling machine\"), a fundamental machine tool, is believed to have been\ninvented by [Ely Whitney](/wiki/Ely_Whitney \"Ely Whitney\"), who was a\ngovernment contractor who built firearms as part of this program. Another\nimportant invention was the Blanchard lathe, invented by [Thomas\nBlanchard](/wiki/Thomas_Blanchard \"Thomas Blanchard\"). The Blanchard lathe, or\npattern tracing lathe, was actually a shaper that could produce copies of\nwooden gun stocks. The use of machinery and the techniques for producing\nstandardized and interchangeable parts became known as the [American system of\nmanufacturing](/wiki/American_system_of_manufacturing \"American system of\nmanufacturing\")[52]\n\nPrecision manufacturing techniques made it possible to build machines that\nmechanized the shoe industry.[155] and the watch industry. The\nindustrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in Waltham,\nMassachusetts, at the [Waltham Watch Company](/wiki/Waltham_Watch_Company\n\"Waltham Watch Company\"), with the development of machine tools, gauges and\nassembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches.\n\n## Second Industrial Revolution\n\nMain article: [Second Industrial\nRevolution](/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution \"Second Industrial Revolution\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Hartmann_Maschinenhalle_1868_%2801%29.jpg/220px-\nHartmann_Maschinenhalle_1868_%2801%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hartmann_Maschinenhalle_1868_\\(01\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hartmann_Maschinenhalle_1868_\\(01\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Sächsische Maschinenfabrik](/wiki/S%C3%A4chsische_Maschinenfabrik \"Sächsische\nMaschinenfabrik\") in [Chemnitz](/wiki/Chemnitz \"Chemnitz\"), Germany, 1868\n\n[Steel](/wiki/Steel \"Steel\") is often cited as the first of several new areas\nfor industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a \"Second\nIndustrial Revolution\", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass\nmanufacture of [steel](/wiki/Steel \"Steel\") was not invented until the 1860s,\nwhen [Sir Henry Bessemer](/wiki/Henry_Bessemer \"Henry Bessemer\") invented a\nnew furnace which could convert molten [pig iron](/wiki/Pig_iron \"Pig iron\")\ninto steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in\nthe 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform\nquality.[34][156] Bessemer steel was being displaced by the [open hearth\nfurnace](/wiki/Open_hearth_furnace \"Open hearth furnace\") near the end of the\n19th century.\n\nThis Second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include chemicals, mainly\nthe [chemical industries](/wiki/Chemical_industry \"Chemical industry\"),\n[petroleum](/wiki/Petroleum \"Petroleum\") (refining and distribution), and, in\nthe 20th century, the [automotive industry](/wiki/Automotive_industry\n\"Automotive industry\"), and was marked by a transition of technological\nleadership from Britain to the United States and Germany.\n\nThe increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the\nimportance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation.\n\nA new revolution began with electricity and\n[electrification](/wiki/Electrification \"Electrification\") in the [electrical\nindustries](/wiki/Electrical_power_industry \"Electrical power industry\"). The\nintroduction of [hydroelectric power](/wiki/Hydroelectricity\n\"Hydroelectricity\") generation in the [Alps](/wiki/Alps \"Alps\") enabled the\nrapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern Italy, beginning in the\n1890s.\n\nBy the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant\nindustrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like\n[U.S. Steel](/wiki/U.S._Steel \"U.S. Steel\"), [General\nElectric](/wiki/General_Electric \"General Electric\"), [Standard\nOil](/wiki/Standard_Oil \"Standard Oil\") and [Bayer AG](/wiki/Bayer \"Bayer\")\njoined the railroad and ship companies on the world's [stock\nmarkets](/wiki/Stock_market \"Stock market\").\n\n## Causes\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Historic_world_GDP_per_capita.svg/300px-\nHistoric_world_GDP_per_capita.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Historic_world_GDP_per_capita.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Historic_world_GDP_per_capita.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRegional [GDP](/wiki/Gross_domestic_product \"Gross domestic product\") per\ncapita changed very little for most of human history before the Industrial\nRevolution.\n\nThe causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic\nfor debate, with some historians believing the Revolution was an outgrowth of\nsocial and institutional changes brought by the end of\n[feudalism](/wiki/Feudalism \"Feudalism\") in [Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain\n\"Great Britain\") after the [English Civil War](/wiki/English_Civil_War\n\"English Civil War\") in the 17th century. The [Enclosure\nmovement](/wiki/Enclosure_movement \"Enclosure movement\") and the [British\nAgricultural Revolution](/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution \"British\nAgricultural Revolution\") made food production more efficient and less labour-\nintensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in\nagriculture into [cottage industry](/wiki/Cottage_industry \"Cottage\nindustry\"), for example [weaving](/wiki/Weaving \"Weaving\"), and in the longer\nterm into the cities and the newly developed [factories](/wiki/Factory\n\"Factory\").[157] The [colonial expansion](/wiki/Colonialism \"Colonialism\") of\nthe 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade,\ncreation of [financial markets](/wiki/Financial_market \"Financial market\") and\naccumulation of [capital](/wiki/Capital_\\(economics\\) \"Capital \\(economics\\)\")\nare also cited as factors, as is the [scientific\nrevolution](/wiki/Scientific_revolution \"Scientific revolution\") of the 17th\ncentury.[158] A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made\npeople able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby\nencouraging economic development.[159]\n\nUntil the 1980s, it was universally believed by academic historians that\ntechnological innovation was the heart of the Industrial Revolution and the\nkey enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam\nengine.[160] However, recent research into the Marketing Era has challenged\nthe traditional, supply-oriented interpretation of the Industrial\nRevolution.[161]\n\n[Lewis Mumford](/wiki/Lewis_Mumford \"Lewis Mumford\") has proposed that the\nIndustrial Revolution had its origins in the [Early Middle\nAges](/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages \"Early Middle Ages\"), much earlier than most\nestimates.[162] He explains that the model for standardised [mass\nproduction](/wiki/Mass_production \"Mass production\") was the [printing\npress](/wiki/Printing_press \"Printing press\") and that \"the archetypal model\nfor the industrial era was the clock\". He also cites the\n[monastic](/wiki/Monasticism \"Monasticism\") emphasis on order and time-\nkeeping, as well as the fact that [medieval](/wiki/Medieval \"Medieval\") cities\nhad at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being\nnecessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more\nphysical, manifestations such as the steam engine.\n\nThe presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important\ndriver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred\nin Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local\nregions, which often imposed tolls and [tariffs](/wiki/Tariff \"Tariff\") on\ngoods traded among them.[163] Internal tariffs were abolished by [Henry VIII\nof England](/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England \"Henry VIII of England\"), they\nsurvived in Russia till 1753, 1789 in France and 1839 in Spain.\n\nGovernments' grant of limited [monopolies](/wiki/Monopoly \"Monopoly\") to\ninventors under a developing [patent](/wiki/Patent \"Patent\") system (the\n[Statute of Monopolies](/wiki/Statute_of_Monopolies \"Statute of Monopolies\")\nin 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both\ngood and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated\nin the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for\npublicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded\ninventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of\nthe first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace\nof technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own\ninefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial\neffects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors.[164] Watt's monopoly\nprevented other inventors, such as [Richard\nTrevithick](/wiki/Richard_Trevithick \"Richard Trevithick\"), [William\nMurdoch](/wiki/William_Murdoch \"William Murdoch\"), or [Jonathan\nHornblower](/wiki/Jonathan_Hornblower \"Jonathan Hornblower\"), whom Boulton and\nWatt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the\nspread of steam power.[165][166]\n\n### Causes in Europe\n\nMain article: [Great Divergence](/wiki/Great_Divergence \"Great Divergence\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Microcosm_of_London_Plate_017_-_The_Coal_Exchange_%28tone%29.jpg/220px-\nMicrocosm_of_London_Plate_017_-_The_Coal_Exchange_%28tone%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Microcosm_of_London_Plate_017_-_The_Coal_Exchange_\\(tone\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Microcosm_of_London_Plate_017_-_The_Coal_Exchange_\\(tone\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nInterior of the [London Coal Exchange](/wiki/Coal_Exchange_\\(London\\) \"Coal\nExchange \\(London\\)\"), c. 1808.  \nEuropean 17th century colonial expansion, international trade, and creation of\nfinancial markets produced a new legal and financial environment, one which\nsupported and enabled 18th century industrial growth.\n\nOne question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution\noccurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century,\nparticularly China, [India](/wiki/Indian_subcontinent \"Indian subcontinent\"),\nand the Middle East, or at other times like in [Classical\nAntiquity](/wiki/Classical_antiquity \"Classical antiquity\")[167] or the\n[Middle Ages](/wiki/Middle_Ages \"Middle Ages\").[168] Numerous factors have\nbeen suggested, including education, technological changes[169] (see\n[Scientific Revolution](/wiki/Scientific_revolution \"Scientific revolution\")\nin Europe), \"modern\" government, \"modern\" work attitudes, ecology, and\nculture.[170]\n\nChina was the world's most technological advanced country for many centuries;\nhowever, China stagnated economically and technologically and was surpassed by\nWestern Europe before the Age of Exploration, by which time China banned\nimports and denied entry to foreigners. China was also a totalitarian\nsociety.[171][172] Modern estimates of per capita income on Western Europe in\nthe late 18th century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in [purchasing power\nparity](/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity \"Purchasing power parity\") (and Britain\nhad a [per capita income](/wiki/Per_capita_income \"Per capita income\") of\nnearly 2,000 dollars[173]) whereas China, by comparison, had only 450 dollars.\nIndia was essentially feudal, politically fragmented and not as economically\nadvanced as Western Europe.[174]\n\nHistorians such as [David Landes](/wiki/David_Landes \"David Landes\") and [Max\nWeber](/wiki/Max_Weber \"Max Weber\") credit the different belief systems in\nAsia and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred.[175] The\nreligion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of [Judaeo-\nChristianity](/wiki/Judeo-Christian \"Judeo-Christian\") and\n[Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greece \"Ancient Greece\") thought. Conversely, Chinese\nsociety was founded on men like [Confucius](/wiki/Confucius \"Confucius\"),\n[Mencius](/wiki/Mencius \"Mencius\"), [Han Feizi](/wiki/Han_Fei \"Han Fei\")\n([Legalism](/wiki/Legalism_\\(Chinese_philosophy\\) \"Legalism \\(Chinese\nphilosophy\\)\")), [Lao Tzu](/wiki/Laozi \"Laozi\") ([Taoism](/wiki/Taoism\n\"Taoism\")), and [Buddha](/wiki/Gautama_Buddha \"Gautama Buddha\")\n([Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism \"Buddhism\")), resulting in very different\nworldviews.[176] Other factors include the considerable distance of China's\ncoal deposits, though large, from its cities as well as the then unnavigable\n[Yellow River](/wiki/Yellow_River \"Yellow River\") that connects these deposits\nto the sea.[177]\n\nRegarding India, the Marxist historian [Rajani Palme\nDutt](/wiki/Rajani_Palme_Dutt \"Rajani Palme Dutt\") said: \"The capital to\nfinance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the\nIndustrial Revolution in Britain.\"[178] In contrast to China, India was split\nup into many competing kingdoms after the decline of the [Mughal\nEmpire](/wiki/Mughal_Empire \"Mughal Empire\"), with the major ones in its\naftermath including the [Marathas](/wiki/Maratha \"Maratha\"),\n[Sikhs](/wiki/Sikh \"Sikh\"), [Bengal Subah](/wiki/Bengal_Subah \"Bengal Subah\"),\nand [Kingdom of Mysore](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mysore \"Kingdom of Mysore\"). In\naddition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors – agriculture of\nsubsistence and cotton, and there appears to have been little technical\ninnovation. It is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored\naway in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the British take\nover.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nEconomic historian [Joel Mokyr](/wiki/Joel_Mokyr \"Joel Mokyr\") has argued that\npolitical fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states)\nmade it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators,\nideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event\nthat the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is\nwhat set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires\nsuch as China and India. China had both a printing press and movable type, and\nIndia had similar levels scientific and technological achievement as Europe in\n1700, yet the industrial revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India.\nIn Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an \"integrated market for\nideas\" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a\nshared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European\ninstitution of the [Republic of Letters](/wiki/Republic_of_Letters \"Republic\nof Letters\").[179]\n\n### Causes in Britain\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Graph_rel_share_world_manuf_1750_1900_02.png/300px-\nGraph_rel_share_world_manuf_1750_1900_02.png)](/wiki/File:Graph_rel_share_world_manuf_1750_1900_02.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Graph_rel_share_world_manuf_1750_1900_02.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nAs the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged\nahead of other economies.\n\nGreat Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled\n[entrepreneurs](/wiki/Entrepreneur \"Entrepreneur\") to pioneer the industrial\nrevolution.[180] Key factors fostering this environment were: (1) The period\nof peace and stability which followed the unification of England and Scotland;\n(2) no trade barriers between England and Scotland; (3) the rule of law\n(enforcing property rights and respecting the sanctity of contracts); (4) a\nstraightforward legal system that allowed the formation of joint-stock\ncompanies (corporations); (5) absence of tolls, which had largely disappeared\nfrom Britain by the 15th century, but were an extreme burden on goods\nelsewhere in the world, and (6) a free market (capitalism).[24]\n\n\"An unprecedented explosion of new ideas, and new technological inventions,\ntransformed our use of energy, creating an increasingly industrial and\nurbanised country. Roads, railways and canals were built. Great cities\nappeared. Scores of factories and mills sprang up. Our landscape would never\nbe the same again. It was a revolution that transformed not only the country,\nbut the world itself.\"\n\n– British historian [Jeremy Black](/wiki/Jeremy_Black_\\(historian\\) \"Jeremy\nBlack \\(historian\\)\") on the BBC's _Why the Industrial Revolution Happened\nHere_.[108]\n\nGeographical and natural resource advantages of Great Britain were the fact\nthat it had extensive coast lines and many navigable rivers in an age where\nwater was the easiest means of transportation and having the highest quality\ncoal in Europe.[24]\n\nThere were two main values that really drove the Industrial Revolution in\nBritain. These values were self-interest and an\n[entrepreneurial](/wiki/Entrepreneurial \"Entrepreneurial\") spirit. Because of\nthese interests, many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge\nincrease in personal wealth and a [consumer](/wiki/Consumer \"Consumer\")\nrevolution.[108] These advancements also greatly benefitted the British\nsociety as a whole. Countries around the world started to recognise the\nchanges and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their\nown Industrial Revolutions.[181]\n\nThe debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the\nmassive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed\nthe importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from\nits many overseas [colonies](/wiki/British_Empire#Colonization \"British\nEmpire\") or that profits from the British [slave\ntrade](/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade \"Atlantic slave trade\") between Africa and\nthe Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed\nout that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the\nBritish national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.[182]\nEven though slavery accounted for so little, Caribbean-based demand accounted\nfor 12% of Britain's industrial output.[183]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/William_Bell_Scott_-\n_Iron_and_Coal.jpg/210px-William_Bell_Scott_-\n_Iron_and_Coal.jpg)](/wiki/File:William_Bell_Scott_-_Iron_and_Coal.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:William_Bell_Scott_-_Iron_and_Coal.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[William Bell Scott](/wiki/William_Bell_Scott \"William Bell Scott\") _Iron and\nCoal_ , 1855–60\n\nInstead, the greater [liberalisation](/wiki/Liberalisation \"Liberalisation\")\nof trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and\nuse emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than\ncountries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain\nemerged from the [Napoleonic Wars](/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars \"Napoleonic Wars\") as\nthe only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic\ncollapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European\nmerchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the [Royal\nNavy](/wiki/Royal_Navy \"Royal Navy\")[184]). Britain's extensive exporting\ncottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early\nforms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare\nbeing conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial\nconquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's\ngeographical position – an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Thornhillvanda.jpg/220px-\nThornhillvanda.jpg)](/wiki/File:Thornhillvanda.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Thornhillvanda.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_William and Mary Presenting the Cap of Liberty to Europe_ , 1716, Sir [James\nThornhill](/wiki/James_Thornhill \"James Thornhill\"). Enthroned in heaven with\nthe Virtues behind them are the royals [William\nIII](/wiki/William_III_of_England \"William III of England\") and [Mary\nII](/wiki/Mary_II_of_England \"Mary II of England\") who had taken the throne\nafter the [Glorious Revolution](/wiki/Glorious_Revolution \"Glorious\nRevolution\") and signed the [English Bill of\nRights](/wiki/English_Bill_of_Rights \"English Bill of Rights\") of 1689.\nWilliam tramples on arbitrary power and hands the red cap of liberty to Europe\nwhere, unlike Britain, [absolute monarchy](/wiki/Absolute_monarchy \"Absolute\nmonarchy\") stayed the normal form of power execution. Below William is the\nFrench king [Louis XIV](/wiki/Louis_XIV \"Louis XIV\").[185]\n\nAnother theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial\nRevolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a\ndense population for its small geographical size. [Enclosure](/wiki/Enclosure\n\"Enclosure\") of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a\nsupply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of\nnatural resources in the [North of England](/wiki/Northern_England \"Northern\nEngland\"), the [English Midlands](/wiki/English_Midlands \"English Midlands\"),\n[South Wales](/wiki/South_Wales \"South Wales\") and the [Scottish\nLowlands](/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands \"Scottish Lowlands\"). Local supplies of\ncoal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in\nexcellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the\ndamp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal\nconditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for\nthe birth of the textiles industry.\n\nThe stable political situation in Britain from around 1688 following the\n[Glorious Revolution](/wiki/Glorious_Revolution \"Glorious Revolution\"), and\nBritish society's greater receptiveness to change (compared with other\nEuropean countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial\nRevolution. Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by\nthe Enclosure movement, and the landed upper classes developed commercial\ninterests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of\ncapitalism.[186] (This point is also made in [Hilaire\nBelloc](/wiki/Hilaire_Belloc \"Hilaire Belloc\")'s _[The Servile\nState](/wiki/The_Servile_State \"The Servile State\")_.)\n\nThe French philosopher [Voltaire](/wiki/Voltaire \"Voltaire\") wrote about\ncapitalism and religious tolerance in his book on English society, _[Letters\non the English](/wiki/Letters_on_the_English \"Letters on the English\")_\n(1733), noting why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to\nthe country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. \"Take a view of\nthe [Royal Exchange in London](/wiki/Royal_Exchange,_London \"Royal Exchange,\nLondon\"), a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the\nrepresentatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew,\nthe Mahometan [Muslim], and the Christian transact together, as though they\nall professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but\nbankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the\nChurchman depends on the Quaker’s word. If one religion only were allowed in\nEngland, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were\nbut two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a\nmultitude, they all live happy and in peace.\"[187]\n\nBritain's population grew 280% 1550–1820, while the rest of Western Europe\ngrew 50–80%. Seventy percent of European urbanisation happened in Britain\n1750–1800. By 1800, only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain. This\nwas only possible because coal, coke, imported cotton, brick and slate had\nreplaced wood, charcoal, flax, peat and thatch. The latter compete with land\ngrown to feed people while mined materials do not. Yet more land would be\nfreed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse's work was\nmechanised. A workhorse needs 3 to 5 acres (1.21 to 2.02 [ha](/wiki/Hectare\n\"Hectare\")) for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more\nmechanical energy.\n\nIn 1700, 5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in Britain, while the Netherlands had\nnone; so despite having Europe's best transport, most urbanised, well paid,\nliterate people and lowest taxes, it failed to industrialise. In the 18th\ncentury, it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank.\nWithout coal, Britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by\nthe 1830s.[188]\n\nEconomic historian Robert Allen has argued that high wages, cheap capital and\nvery cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial\nrevolution to occur.[189] These factors made it vastly more profitable to\ninvest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain\nthan other societies.[189]\n\n### Transfer of knowledge\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Wright_of_Derby%2C_The_Orrery.jpg/220px-\nWright_of_Derby%2C_The_Orrery.jpg)](/wiki/File:Wright_of_Derby,_The_Orrery.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Wright_of_Derby,_The_Orrery.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[A Philosopher Lecturing on the\nOrrery](/wiki/A_Philosopher_Lecturing_on_the_Orrery \"A Philosopher Lecturing\non the Orrery\") (ca. 1766). Informal philosophical societies spread scientific\nadvances\n\nKnowledge of innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained\nin the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common\nmethod was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he\ncould. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century\nbefore, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some\nnations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to\nundertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain\nand America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager\nto improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the\nkeeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of\nthe period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.\n\nAnother means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal\nphilosophical societies, like the [Lunar Society of\nBirmingham](/wiki/Lunar_Society_of_Birmingham \"Lunar Society of Birmingham\"),\nin which members met to discuss 'natural philosophy' (_i.e._ science) and\noften its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765\nto 1809, and it has been said of them, \"They were, if you like, the\nrevolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth\ncentury revolutions, the Industrial Revolution\".[190] Other such societies\npublished volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-\nbased [Royal Society of Arts](/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Arts \"Royal Society of\nArts\") published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers\nabout them in its annual _Transactions_.\n\nThere were publications describing technology.\n[Encyclopaedias](/wiki/Encyclopedia \"Encyclopedia\") such as\n[Harris](/wiki/John_Harris_\\(writer\\) \"John Harris \\(writer\\)\")'s _[Lexicon\nTechnicum](/wiki/Lexicon_Technicum \"Lexicon Technicum\")_ (1704) and [Abraham\nRees](/wiki/Abraham_Rees \"Abraham Rees\")'s\n_[Cyclopaedia](/wiki/Cyclopaedia,_or_an_Universal_Dictionary_of_Arts_and_Sciences\n\"Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences\")_ (1802–1819)\ncontain much of value. _Cyclopaedia_ contains an enormous amount of\ninformation about the science and technology of the first half of the\nIndustrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign\nprinted sources such as the _[Descriptions des Arts et\nMétiers](/wiki/Descriptions_des_Arts_et_M%C3%A9tiers \"Descriptions des Arts et\nMétiers\")_ and Diderot's _[Encyclopédie](/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die\n\"Encyclopédie\")_ explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.\n\nPeriodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in\nthe last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the\nlatest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the _Annales des Mines_ ,\npublished accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British\nmethods on study tours.\n\n#### Protestant work ethic\n\nMain article: [Protestant work ethic](/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic \"Protestant\nwork ethic\")\n\nAnother theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an\n[entrepreneurial](/wiki/Entrepreneur \"Entrepreneur\") class which believed in\nprogress, technology and hard work.[191] The existence of this class is often\nlinked to the [Protestant work ethic](/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic \"Protestant\nwork ethic\") (see [Max Weber](/wiki/Max_Weber \"Max Weber\")) and the particular\nstatus of the [Baptists](/wiki/Baptists \"Baptists\") and the dissenting\nProtestant sects, such as the [Quakers](/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends\n\"Religious Society of Friends\") and [Presbyterians](/wiki/Presbyterianism\n\"Presbyterianism\") that had flourished with the [English Civil\nWar](/wiki/English_Civil_War \"English Civil War\"). Reinforcement of confidence\nin the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of\nconstitutional monarchy in Britain in the [Glorious\nRevolution](/wiki/Glorious_Revolution \"Glorious Revolution\") of 1688, and the\nemergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the\n[national debt](/wiki/Government_debt \"Government debt\") by the [Bank of\nEngland](/wiki/Bank_of_England \"Bank of England\"), contributed to the capacity\nfor, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.\n\n[Dissenters](/wiki/English_Dissenters \"English Dissenters\") found themselves\nbarred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at\nEngland's [only two universities](/wiki/Oxbridge \"Oxbridge\") at the time\n(although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland's [four\nuniversities](/wiki/Ancient_universities_of_Scotland \"Ancient universities of\nScotland\")). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in\nthe official [Anglican Church](/wiki/Anglican_Communion \"Anglican Communion\")\nbecame mandatory due to the [Test Act](/wiki/Test_Act \"Test Act\"), they\nthereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The\n[Unitarians](/wiki/Unitarianism \"Unitarianism\"), in particular, were very\ninvolved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to\nthe universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow,\nmuch attention was given to mathematics and the sciences – areas of\nscholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.\n\nHistorians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important,\nalong with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of\nthese sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were\nconsidered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the [middle\nclass](/wiki/Middle_class \"Middle class\"), such as traditional financiers or\nother businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital,\nthe natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be\nto seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the\nscientific revolution of the 17th century.\n\n## Opposition from Romanticism\n\nMain article: [Romanticism](/wiki/Romanticism \"Romanticism\")\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility\ntowards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the Romantic\nmovement. Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled\nagainst the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the\nwretchedness of the working classes.[192] Its major exponents in English\nincluded the artist and poet [William Blake](/wiki/William_Blake \"William\nBlake\") and poets [William Wordsworth](/wiki/William_Wordsworth \"William\nWordsworth\"), [Samuel Taylor Coleridge](/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge \"Samuel\nTaylor Coleridge\"), [John Keats](/wiki/John_Keats \"John Keats\"), [Lord\nByron](/wiki/George_Gordon_Byron,_6th_Baron_Byron \"George Gordon Byron, 6th\nBaron Byron\") and [Percy Bysshe Shelley](/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley \"Percy\nBysshe Shelley\"). The movement stressed the importance of \"nature\" in art and\nlanguage, in contrast to \"monstrous\" machines and factories; the \"Dark satanic\nmills\" of Blake's poem \"[And did those feet in ancient\ntime](/wiki/And_did_those_feet_in_ancient_time \"And did those feet in ancient\ntime\")\". [Mary Shelley](/wiki/Mary_Shelley \"Mary Shelley\")'s novel\n_[Frankenstein](/wiki/Frankenstein \"Frankenstein\")_ reflected concerns that\nscientific progress might be two-edged. French Romanticism likewise was highly\ncritical of industry.[193]\n\n## See also\n\nGeneral\n\n  * [Automation](/wiki/Automation \"Automation\")\n  * [Capitalist mode of production](/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_\\(Marxist_theory\\) \"Capitalist mode of production \\(Marxist theory\\)\")\n  * [Deindustrialization](/wiki/Deindustrialization \"Deindustrialization\")\n  * [Division of labour](/wiki/Division_of_labour \"Division of labour\")\n  * [Dual revolution](/wiki/Dual_revolution \"Dual revolution\")\n  * [Economic history of the United Kingdom](/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Economic history of the United Kingdom\")\n  * [Capitalism in the nineteenth century](/wiki/History_of_capitalism#Nineteenth_century \"History of capitalism\")\n  * [Human timeline](/wiki/Template:Human_timeline \"Template:Human timeline\")\n  * [Industrial Age](/wiki/Industrial_Age \"Industrial Age\")\n  * [Information revolution](/wiki/Information_revolution \"Information revolution\")\n  * [Law of the handicap of a head start](/wiki/Law_of_the_handicap_of_a_head_start \"Law of the handicap of a head start\") – Dialectics of progress\n  * [Machine Age](/wiki/Machine_Age \"Machine Age\")\n  * [The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism](/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\")\n  * [Industrial society](/wiki/Industrial_society \"Industrial society\")\n  * [Digital Revolution](/wiki/Digital_Revolution \"Digital Revolution\")\n\nOther\n\n  * [Chinese industrialization](/wiki/Chinese_industrialization \"Chinese industrialization\")\n  * [Petroleum Revolution](/wiki/Petroleum_Revolution \"Petroleum Revolution\")\n  * [Science and invention in Birmingham](/wiki/Science_and_invention_in_Birmingham \"Science and invention in Birmingham\")\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ David S.

Among the first complex industrial manufacturing processes to arise in Britain were those that produced material for British warships. For instance, the average warship of the period used roughly 1000 pulley fittings. With a fleet as large as the Royal Navy, and with these fittings needing to be replaced ever 4 to 5 years, this created a great demand which encouraged industrial expansion. The industrial manufacture of rope can also be see as a similar factor.\n  185. **Jump up ^** [Old Naval College](http://www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/data/files/english-ph-june-06-offical-new-30.pdf) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20070626185300/http://www.oldroyalnavalcollege.org/data/files/english-ph-june-06-offical-new-30.pdf) 26 June 2007 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine \"Wayback Machine\").\n  186. **Jump up ^** [Barrington Moore, Jr.](/wiki/Barrington_Moore,_Jr. \"Barrington Moore, Jr.\"), _Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World_ , pp. 29–30, Boston, Beacon Press, 1966.\n  187. **Jump up ^** Voltaire, François Marie Arouet de.
