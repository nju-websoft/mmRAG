It was\nfirst published in 2008 and won the 40th [Man Booker\nPrize](/wiki/Man_Booker_Prize \"Man Booker Prize\") in the same year.[1] The\nnovel provides a darkly humorous perspective of India’s class struggle in a\nglobalized world as told through a retrospective narration from Balram Halwai,\na village boy. In detailing Balram's journey first to Delhi, where he works as\na chauffeur to a rich landlord, and then to Bangalore, the place to which he\nflees after killing his master and stealing his money, the novel examines\nissues of religion, caste, loyalty, corruption and [poverty in\nIndia](/wiki/Poverty_in_India \"Poverty in India\").[2] Ultimately, Balram\ntranscends his sweet-maker caste and becomes a successful entrepreneur,\nestablishing his own taxi service. In a nation proudly shedding a history of\npoverty and underdevelopment, he represents, as he himself says, \"tomorrow.\"\n\nThe novel has been well-received, making the _New York Times_ bestseller list\nin addition to winning the Man Booker Prize.[3] Aravind Adiga, 33 at the time,\nwas the second youngest writer as well as the fourth debut writer to win the\nprize in 2008.[4] Adiga says his novel \"attempt[s] to catch the voice of the\nmen you meet as you travel through India — the voice of the colossal\nunderclass.\"[5] According to Adiga, the exigence for _The White Tiger_ was to\ncapture the unspoken voice of people from \"the Darkness\" – the impoverished\nareas of rural India, and he \"wanted to do so without sentimentality or\nportraying them as mirthless humorless weaklings as they are usually.\"[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot summary\n  * 2 Themes\n    * 2.1 Globalization\n    * 2.2 Individualism\n    * 2.3 Freedom\n    * 2.4 Social class/caste\n    * 2.5 Critical Analysis\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 External links\n\n## Plot\nsummary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_White_Tiger&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Plot summary\")]\n\nBalram Halwai narrates his life in a letter, written in seven consecutive\nnights and addressed to the [Chinese Premier](/wiki/Chinese_Premier \"Chinese\nPremier\"), [Wen Jiabao](/wiki/Wen_Jiabao \"Wen Jiabao\"). In his letter, Balram\nexplains how he, the son of a [rickshaw](/wiki/Rickshaw \"Rickshaw\") puller,\nescaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing\nhimself as an entrepreneur.\n\nBalram was born in the rural village of [Laxmangarh](/wiki/Laxmangarh\n\"Laxmangarh\"), where he lived with his grandmother, parents, brother and\nextended family. He is a smart child but is forced to leave school in order to\nhelp pay for his cousin's [dowry](/wiki/Dowry \"Dowry\") and begins to work in a\nteashop with his brother in [Dhanbad](/wiki/Dhanbad \"Dhanbad\"). While working\nthere he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the\ncustomers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant but a good\nlistener and decides to become a driver.\n\nAfter learning how to drive, Balram finds a job driving Ashok, the son of one\nof Laxmangarh's landlords. He takes over the job of the main driver, from a\nsmall car to a heavy-luxury described [Honda City](/wiki/Honda_City \"Honda\nCity\"). He stops sending money back to his family and disrespects his\ngrandmother during a trip back to his village. Balram moves to [New\nDelhi](/wiki/New_Delhi \"New Delhi\") with Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam.\nThroughout their time in Delhi, Balram is exposed to extensive corruption,\nespecially in the government. In Delhi, the contrast between the poor and the\nwealthy is made even more evident by their proximity to one another.\n\nOne night Pinky Madam takes the wheel from Balram, while drunk, hits something\nin the road and drives away; we are left to assume that she has killed a\nchild. Ashok's family puts pressure on Balram to confess that he had been\ndriving alone. Ashok becomes increasingly involved in bribing government\nofficials for the benefit of the family coal business. Balram then decides\nthat killing Ashok will be the only way to escape India's _Rooster Coop_.\nAfter bludgeoning Ashok with a bottle and stealing a large bribe, Balram moves\nto [Bangalore](/wiki/Bangalore \"Bangalore\"), where he bribes the police in\norder to help start his own taxi business. Interestingly, Ashok too is\nportrayed to be trapped in the metaphorical Rooster Coop: his family controls\nwhat he does and society dictates how he acts. Just like Ashok, Balram pays\noff a family whose son one of his taxi drivers hit and killed. Balram explains\nthat his own family was almost certainly killed by Ashok's relatives as\nretribution for his murder. At the end of the novel, Balram rationalizes his\nactions and considers that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and of\nAshok. And thus ends the letter to Jiabao, letting the reader think of the\ndark humour of the tale, as well as the idea of life as a trap introduced by\nthe writer.\n\n## Themes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_White_Tiger&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Themes\")]\n\n###\nGlobalization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_White_Tiger&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Globalization\")]\n\n_The White Tiger_ takes place in a time in which increased technology has led\nto world globalization, and India is no exception. In the past decade, India\nhas had one of the fastest booming economies. Specifically\n[Americanization](/wiki/Americanization \"Americanization\") in India has played\nits role in the plot, since it provides an outlet for Balram to alter his\ncaste. To satisfy Pinky’s want for American culture, Ashok, Pinky, and Balram\nsimply move to [Gurgaon](/wiki/Gurgaon \"Gurgaon\") instead of back to America.\nGlobalization has assisted in the creation of an American atmosphere in India.\nAshok justifies this move by explaining \"Today it’s the _modernest_ suburb of\nDelhi. American Express, Microsoft, all the big American companies have\noffices there. The main road is full of shopping malls—each mall has a cinema\ninside! So if Pinky Madam missed America, this was the best place to bring\nher\".[6] By blackmailing Ram Persad, the other driver, Balram is promoted and\ndrives Ashok and Pinky to their new home.\n\nAshok is even convinced India is surpassing the USA, \"There are so many more\nthings I could do here than in New York now...The way things are changing in\nIndia now, this place is going to be like America in ten years\".[7] Balram is\nnoticing the rapid growth as well. From the beginning of his story he knows\nthat in order to rise above his caste he should become an entrepreneur.\nAlthough his taxi service is not an international business, Balram plans to\nkeep up with the pace of globalization and change his trade when need be. \"I‘m\nalways a man who sees ‘tomorrow’ when others see ‘today.’\"[8] Balram's\nrecognition of the increasing competition resulting from globalization\ncontributes to his corruption.\n\n###\nIndividualism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_White_Tiger&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Individualism\")]\n\nThroughout the book, there are references to how Balram is very different from\nthose back in his home environment. He is referred to as the \"white tiger\"[9]\n(which also happens to be the title of the book). A white tiger symbolizes\npower in East Asian cultures,[10] such as in Vietnam. It is also a symbol for\nfreedom and individuality. Balram is seen as different from those he grew up\nwith. He is the one who got out of the \"Darkness\" and found his way into the\n\"Light\".\n\n### Freedom[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_White_Tiger&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Freedom\")]\n\nIn an interview with Aravind Adiga, he talked about how \"The White Tiger\" was\na book about a man’s quest for freedom.[11] Balram, the protagonist in the\nnovel, worked his way out of his low social caste (often referred to as \"the\nDarkness\") and overcame the social obstacles that limited his family in the\npast. Climbing up the social ladder, Balram sheds the weights and limits of\nhis past and overcomes the social obstacles that keep him from living life to\nthe fullest that he can. In the book, Balram talks about how he was in a\n[rooster coop](/wiki/The_White_Tiger#The_rooster_coop \"The White Tiger\") and\nhow he broke free from his coop. The novel is somewhat of a memoir of his\njourney to finding his freedom in India’s modern day capitalist society.\nTowards the beginning of the novel, Balram cites a poem from the Muslim poet\nIqbal where he talks about slaves and says \"They remain slaves because they\ncan’t see what is beautiful in this world.\"[12] Balram sees himself embodying\nthe poem and being the one who sees the world and takes it as he rises through\nthe ranks of society, and in doing so finding his freedom.\n\n### Social\nclass/caste[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_White_Tiger&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Social class/caste\")]\n\nThe book shows a modern day, capitalist Indian society with free market and\nfree business. It also shows how it can create economic division. In India\nthere are not social classes, there are social castes. The novel portrays\nIndia’s society as very negative towards the lower social caste.\n\nThe novel is based on the disparities of two worlds: darkness, inhabited by\npoor and underprivileged who cannot even meet their bare minimums; and the\nlighted world, inhabited by zamindars, politicians, businessmen etc. who\nshamelessly exploits the ones from darkness, making them even more poor and\ngrows their own grandeur.[13]\n\nBalram refers to it as the \"Darkness\". When Balram was asked which caste he\nwas from, he knew that it could ultimately cause a biased stance in his\nemployer and determine the future of his employment. There is definitely a big\ndifference seen in Balram’s lower caste from back home and his current higher\ncaste in their lifestyles, habits, and standards of living. This novel is\nshowing how our economic system today creates socioeconomic gaps that create a\nbig division in society. It limits opportunity, social mobility, health, and\nother rights and pleasures that should be given to all. There is a big\ndifference in the amount of money spread around in society today and this book\nis alluding to that fact.\n\n### Critical\nAnalysis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_White_Tiger&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Critical Analysis\")]\n\nAravind Adiga’s White Tiger tells the story of Balram Halwei. Born in India’s\noverarching darkness of perpetual servanthood and poverty, Balram seeks a life\nin the light—a life of freedom and financial prosperity. Balram, a man of many\nnames and of strong conviction, is one of the few who are able to escape the\nDarkness. Unlike the majority of the poor in India, eternally pent up in the\nCoop, he is willing to sacrifice his family for his own self gain. His\nambition and inner drive propels him to commit murder to achieve freedom. To\nbe one’s own man, one must break free from the darkness and live life being\nable to choose his own path. When Balram says, “All I wanted was the chance to\nbe a man—and for that, one murder was enough,” he is technically correct.\nWhile murdering Ashok will result in the resultant murder of his family, the\none murder alone is enough to break free from the Darkness. By murdering\nAshok, therefore, Balram becomes his own man, free of the chains of servitude\nand finally able to control his own destiny.\n\nAccording to Balram, there are two different types of people in India. There\nare those in the light—politicians, businessmen, entrepreneurs, to name a few,\nwho prosper financially and sit at the top of society—and there are those in\nthe Darkness, trapped in lives of poverty and subservience. He explains,\n“Please understand, Your Excellency, that India is two countries in one: an\nIndia of Light, and an India of Darkness” (12). To explain this division he\nuses the metaphor of the Coop: “Go to Old Delhi… Hundred of pale hens and\nbrightly colored roosters, stuffed tightly into wire-mesh cages… They know\nthey are next, yet they cannot rebel. They do not try to get out of the coop.\nThe very same thing is done with humans in this country” (147). The Coop\nrepresents life in the Darkness: a life where the “roosters,” or people,\ncannot choose their own fate, where they live in poverty, where they see their\nfamily decimated around them and are unable to intervene, and in which they\ninevitably will live and die without ever the possibility of escape. Balram’s\nfamily is in the Darkness. While they are supposed to be sweetmakers, or\nHalweis, they live in poverty. His father works tenuously as a rickshaw\npuller, and his brother works in the local tea shop.\n\nBalram’s father implants in him early on this idea of breaking away from the\nDarkness, and of becoming his own man. He instates in Balram the goal of\nbecoming one of those men who are in the light. He says, “My whole life, I\nhave been treated like a donkey. All I want is that one son of mine—at least\none—should live like a man” (26). In the eyes of Balram’s father, a man should\nlive in the light, free from the grueling life of manual labor and servitude.\nBalram adopts this goal, and devotes his life towards attaining it. Later,\nBalram uses the metaphor: “There are just two castes: Men with Big Bellies,\nand Men with Small Bellies. And only two destinies: eat—or get eaten up” (54).\nBalram has a big belly, filled with the lust of freedom and of riches—the same\nbelly which will eventually propel him to murder Ashok and give up his family\nfor the sake of becoming a man.\n\nIn his childhood, Balram recognizes that he is special. When an official comes\nto evaluate his school, he singles out Balram because he is the only one who\ncan read and write. He sees great potential in the boy: “You, young man, are\nan intelligent, honest, vivacious fellow in this crowd of thugs and idiots…\nYou need to go to a real school” (30). The rest of the students are cast into\nthe lowly group of “thugs and idiots, because they will forever remain in the\ndarkness. They do not have the ambition, drive or intelligence that is needed\nto escape—the same characteristics which the inspector sees in Balram.\n\nThe inspector knows that Balram exceeds everyone else within the “jungle” of\nhis lowly school and town. He says, “In any jungle, what is the rarest of\nanimals – the creature that comes along only once in a generation? The white\ntiger” (30). Balram calls himself White Tiger permanently after this event. He\nfully takes on and embodies the life of a white tiger. In Balram’s opinion,\n“[Slaves] remain slaves because they can’t see what is beautiful in this\nworld” (34). A “white tiger” can never be a slave, because it can see and\npursue beauty. “Beauty,” in this case, is the life of financial prosperity and\nfreedom of choice that Balram yearns for. Amidst the other animals in the\ndarkness, amidst the other children in his school and the rest of India\ntrapped in lives of Darkness, all who are unable to see beauty, and who carry\nwith them small bellies, Balram, the “White Tiger,” knows that he must escape\nany means possible.\n\nBalram only faints twice in his life. Each time he faints it is because he\nrealizes that the Darkness is inescapable without some form of resistance. He\nfirst faints when he sees his mother’s dead body around the Ganges: “Soon she\nwould become part of the black mound… And then I understood: this was the real\ngod of Benaras—this black mud of the Ganga into which everything died, and\ndecomposed, and was reborn from, and died into again. The same would happen to\nme when I died and they brought me here. Nothing would get liberated here”\n(15). Balram cannot fathom the prospect of forever remaining in the Darkness.\nHe sees the overwhelming power that being in the Darkness has on the ones in\nit: that when surrounded by others marked by a lack of ambition, leading lives\nof destitute servitude, unable to choose the paths of their own lives, one\ninevitably surrenders to that same life. Balram faints thinking that this\ncould happen to him.\n\nBalram faints for a second time when he goes to the zoo. He sees the White\nTiger trapped in the cage and realizes that he sees himself: “[The tiger] was\nhypnotizing himself by walking like this - that was the way he could tolerate\nthis cage” (237). Balram’s current predicament of servitude serves as his own\ncage. Balram was “hypnotizing himself” by buying into his life of servitude.\nHe wholeheartedly embraced his master, with whom he treated with great love,\nto distract himself from the fact that he was living in a life that he and his\nfather wanted so desperately for him to break free of. “All at once, the tiger\nvanished” (237). When Balram sees himself in that cage, he has an epiphany. Up\nto this point, he had never seriously considered rebelling against or killing\nAshok. But the tiger vanishes from the cage because, at that moment, the caged\nversion of Balram ceased to exist. A changed man, he realizes that he must\nkill Ashok to become his own man and enter into a life of Light.\n\nAfter this epiphany, Balram quickly and deliberately frees himself from the\nDarkness by killing Ashok. Despite the fact that his family may be murdered,\nBalram commits this act because it will transport him to the life he has\ndreamed of and therefore make him a man. Balram has so much disdain for him\nfamily, since he sees the harsh ways by which they drain the life out of his\nfather, that they no longer remain a relevant part of his life. Therefore, he\nis justified in sacrificing them, at least in his eyes. His epiphany at the\nzoo puts in context that life is not worth living if it is lived in the\nDarkness. After killing Ashok with the glass shards of a broken liquor bottle,\nhe says, “I’ve made it! I’ve broken out of the coop!” (275). In this India of\nLight and Darkness, Balram is now in the light. By resisting the life of\nDarkness and by killing Ashok, he now leads a life in which he can choose his\nown fate. The difference between “this India,” Laxmangarh, and “that India,”\nBangalore, is that in “this India” Balram is a free independent man who can\nfinally control his own destiny (262).\n\nThe chandelier embodies Balram’s transformation into a man. Literally, it\nrepresents the materialistic success which he has encountered in his\nentrepreneurial ventures as an independent businessman. Figuratively, it sheds\nlight on him, amidst the Darkness still prevalent in the everyday life of\nIndia. It represents Balram's escape from the presence of Darkness which used\nto dominate his life. By killing Ashok, Balram becomes his own man, freeing\nhimself from servitude and entering a life of independence.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_White_Tiger&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Amitav Ghosh, Aravind Adiga in Booker shortlist\"](http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/sep/09booker.htm).
