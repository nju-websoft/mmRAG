In discrete terms the marginal product of labor is:\n\n     Δ Y Δ L . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\Delta Y}{\\Delta L}}.} ![{\\\\frac  {\\\\Delta Y}{\\\\Delta L}}.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f013a36cce8cfb4eac0504481adaf24b66879caf)\n\nIn continuous terms, the _MP L_ is the first [derivative](/wiki/Derivative\n\"Derivative\") of the [production function](/wiki/Production_function\n\"Production function\"):\n\n     ∂ Y ∂ L . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial Y}{\\partial L}}.} ![{\\\\frac  {\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial L}}.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e1258981e5a2ada060a8b487139a4386eeaf983)[2]\n\nGraphically, the _MP L_ is the slope of the production function.\n\n##\nExamples[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Marginal_product_of_labor&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Examples\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/Marginal_Product_of_Labor1_copy.png)](/wiki/File:Marginal_Product_of_Labor1_copy.png)\n\nMarginal product of labor table\n\nThere is a factory which produces toys. When there are no workers in the\nfactory, no toys are produced. When there is one worker in the factory, six\ntoys are produced per hour. When there are two workers in the factory, eleven\ntoys are produced per hour. There is a marginal product of labor of five when\nthere are two workers in the factory compared to one. When the marginal\nproduct of labor is increasing, this is called [increasing marginal\nreturns](/wiki/Increasing_marginal_returns \"Increasing marginal returns\").\nHowever, as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor may\nnot increase indefinitely. When not [scaled](/wiki/Scale_\\(social_sciences\\)\n\"Scale \\(social sciences\\)\") properly, the marginal product of labor may go\ndown when the number of employees goes up, creating a situation known as\n[diminishing marginal returns](/wiki/Diminishing_marginal_returns \"Diminishing\nmarginal returns\"). When the marginal product of labor becomes negative, it is\nknown as [negative marginal\nreturns](/w/index.php?title=Negative_marginal_returns&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Negative marginal returns \\(page does not exist\\)\").\n\n## Marginal\ncosts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Marginal_product_of_labor&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Marginal costs\")]\n\nThe marginal product of labor is directly related to [costs of\nproduction](/wiki/Cost-of-production_theory_of_value \"Cost-of-production\ntheory of value\"). [Costs](/wiki/Cost \"Cost\") are divided between\n[fixed](/wiki/Fixed_cost \"Fixed cost\") and [variable\ncosts](/wiki/Variable_cost \"Variable cost\"). Fixed costs are costs that relate\nto the fixed input, [capital](/wiki/Capital_\\(economics\\) \"Capital\n\\(economics\\)\"), or _rK_ , where _r_ is the rental cost of capital and _K_ is\nthe quantity of capital. Variable costs (VC) are the costs of the variable\ninput, labor, or _wL_ , where _w_ is the wage rate and _L_ is the amount of\nlabor employed. Thus, VC = wL . Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost\nper unit change in output or ∆C/∆Q. In the short run, production can be varied\nonly by changing the variable input. Thus only variable costs change as output\nincreases: ∆C = ∆VC = ∆(wL). Marginal cost is ∆(Lw)/∆Q. Now, ∆L/∆Q is the\nreciprocal of the marginal product of labor (∆Q/∆L). Therefore, marginal cost\nis simply the wage rate w divided by the marginal product of labor\n\n    MC = ∆VC∕∆Q;\n    ∆VC = w∆L;\n    ∆L∕∆Q (the change in quantity of labor to effect a one unit change in output) = 1∕MPL.\n    Therefore MC = w ∕ MPL\n\nThus if the marginal product of labor is rising then marginal costs will be\nfalling and if the marginal product of labor is falling marginal costs will be\nrising (assuming a constant wage rate).[3]\n\n## Relation between MPL and\nAPL[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Marginal_product_of_labor&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Relation between MPL and APL\")]\n\nThe average product of labor is the total product of labor divided by the\nnumber of units of labor employed, or _Q/L_.[2] The average product of labor\nis a common measure of labor productivity.[4][5] The APL curve is shaped like\nan inverted “u”. At low production levels the APL tends to increase as\nadditional labor is added. The primary reason for the increase is\nspecialization and division of labor.[6] At the point the APL reaches its\nmaximum value APL equals the MPL.[7] Beyond this point the APL falls.\n\nDuring the early stages of production MPL is greater than APL. When the MPL is\nabove the APL the APL will increase. Eventually the _MP L_ reaches it maximum\nvalue at the point of diminishing returns. Beyond this point MPL will\ndecrease. However, at the point of diminishing returns the MPL is still above\nthe APL and APL will continue to increase until MPL equals APL. When MPL is\nbelow APL, APL will decrease.\n\nGraphically, the _AP L_ curve can be derived from the total product curve by\ndrawing secants from the origin that intersect (cut) the total product curve.\nThe slope of the secant line equals the average product of labor, where the\nslope = dQ/dL.[6] The slope of the curve at each intersection marks a point on\nthe average product curve. The slope increases until the line reaches a point\nof tangency with the total product curve. This point marks the maximum average\nproduct of labor. It also marks the point where MPL (which is the slope of the\ntotal product curve)[8] equals the APL (the slope of the secant).[9] Beyond\nthis point the slope of the secants become progressively smaller as _AP L_\ndeclines. The MPL curve intersects the APL curve from above at the maximum\npoint of the APL curve. Thereafter, the MPL curve is below the APL curve.\n\n## Diminishing marginal\nreturns[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Marginal_product_of_labor&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Diminishing marginal returns\")]\n\nThe falling MPL is due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. The law\nstates, \"as units of one input are added (with all other inputs held constant)\na point will be reached where the resulting additions to output will begin to\ndecrease; that is marginal product will decline.\"[10] The law of diminishing\nmarginal returns applies regardless of whether the production function\nexhibits increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale. The key factor\nis that the variable input is being changed while all other factors of\nproduction are being held constant. Under such circumstances diminishing\nmarginal returns are inevitable at some level of production.[11]\n\nDiminishing marginal returns differs from diminishing returns. Diminishing\nmarginal returns means that the marginal product of the variable input is\nfalling. Diminishing returns occur when the marginal product of the variable\ninput is negative. That is when a unit increase in the variable input causes\ntotal product to fall. At the point that diminishing returns begin the MPL is\nzero.[12]\n\n## MPL, MRPL and profit\nmaximization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Marginal_product_of_labor&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: MPL, MRPL and profit maximization\")]\n\nThe general rule is that a firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of\noutput where [marginal revenue](/wiki/Marginal_revenue \"Marginal revenue\")\nequals marginal costs. The profit maximization issue can also be approached\nfrom the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the\nvariable input? To maximize profits the firm should increase usage \"up to the\npoint where the input’s marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs\".\nSo, mathematically the profit maximizing rule is MRPL = MCL.[10] The marginal\nprofit per unit of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor minus\nthe marginal cost of labor or MπL = MRPL − MCLA firm maximizes profits where\nMπL = 0.\n\nThe marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in\nthe variable input assume labor.[10] That is, MRPL = ∆TR/∆L. MRPL is the\nproduct of marginal revenue and the marginal product of labor or MRPL = MR ×\nMPL.\n\n  * Derivation:\n\n    MR = ∆TR/∆Q\n    MPL = ∆Q/∆L\n    MRPL = MR × MPL = (∆TR/∆Q) × (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L\n\n###\nExample[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Marginal_product_of_labor&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Example\")]\n\n  * Assume that the production function is  Q = 90 L − L 2 {\\displaystyle Q=90L-L^{2}} ![Q=90L-L^{2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63d390e77341e9f52d7e1868f77ecbdc99b25029)[10]\n\n•  M C L = 30 {\\displaystyle MC_{L}=30}\n![MC_{L}=30](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/495007989964ceb797ba96b9cc583b5c8926a35b)\n\n• Output price is $40 per unit.\n\n     M P L = 90 − 2 L {\\displaystyle MP_{L}=90-2L} ![MP_{L}=90-2L](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81a16983fcf6cecdc85434919387cec981d4b16b)\n     M R P L = 40 ( 90 − 2 L ) {\\displaystyle MRP_{L}=40(90-2L)} ![MRP_{L}=40\\(90-2L\\)](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f86bbc47b8d76f256f802ec5436f3316beb301ec)\n     M R P L = 3600 − 80 L {\\displaystyle MRP_{L}=3600-80L} ![MRP_{L}=3600-80L](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78a58f2391938e565c2749bd1eca56883e99a63b)\n     M R P L = M C L {\\displaystyle MRP_{L}=MC_{L}} ![MRP_{L}=MC_{L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b6355487ea31e1f8be4ec19e81702fec355671b) (Profit Max Rule)\n     3600 − 80 L = 30 {\\displaystyle 3600-80L=30} ![3600-80L=30](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f2dfc21d082f9c79061323dbf12c1cc9ad6b011)\n     3570 = 80 L {\\displaystyle 3570=80L} ![3570=80L](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a6f35548dee604f8f3c7c1432774e6834e49bae2)\n     L = 44.625 {\\displaystyle L=44.625} ![L=44.625](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff7286acc2c01146083239c6e67431af471c22bb)\n    44.625 is the profit maximizing number of workers.\n     Q = 90 L − L 2 {\\displaystyle Q=90L-L^{2}} ![Q=90L-L^{2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63d390e77341e9f52d7e1868f77ecbdc99b25029)\n     Q = 90 ( 44.625 ) − ( 44.625 ) 2 {\\displaystyle Q=90(44.625)-(44.625)^{2}} ![Q=90\\(44.625\\)-\\(44.625\\)^{2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43b854c02cf2c2a15361b8539f6d0d2a84dc997f)\n     Q = 4016.25 − 1991.39 {\\displaystyle Q=4016.25-1991.39} ![Q=4016.25-1991.39](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f1b3db21fb6de4dc2c6c9664c62c7a58d8389bf7)\n     Q = 2024.86 {\\displaystyle Q=2024.86} ![Q=2024.86](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76cfe8299089b0c655393ccb13714e6014777e4a)\n    Thus, the profit maximizing output is 2025 units\n\n• And the profit is\n\n     T R − T C = Π {\\displaystyle TR-TC=\\Pi } ![TR-TC=\\\\Pi ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdbf626ee5957ec2524612dd77c286d8d4a5ec7b)\n     Π = 40 ( 2025 ) − 30 ( 2025 ) {\\displaystyle \\Pi =40(2025)-30(2025)} ![\\\\Pi =40\\(2025\\)-30\\(2025\\)](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/364cd1a1da409ac031b2c3a8784571694625c0a7)\n     Π = 81 , 000 − 60 , 750 {\\displaystyle \\Pi =81,000-60,750} ![\\\\Pi =81,000-60,750](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45994f838aa76b34a37f5c98effee2895fd5a6a0)\n     Π = 20 , 250 {\\displaystyle \\Pi =20,250} ![\\\\Pi =20,250](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e11c4a7b18bc7f569c34d5a10a907fd4b28ec710)\n\n  * Some might be confused by the fact that  L = 44.625 {\\displaystyle L=44.625} ![L=44.625](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff7286acc2c01146083239c6e67431af471c22bb) as intuition would say that labor should be discrete.

In\nthe 20th century, marginal productivity ethics found few supporters among\neconomists, being criticised not only by egalitarians but by economists\nassociated with the [Chicago school](/wiki/Chicago_school_\\(economics\\)\n\"Chicago school \\(economics\\)\") such as [Frank Knight](/wiki/Frank_Knight\n\"Frank Knight\") (in _The Ethics of Competition_) and the [Austrian\nSchool](/wiki/Austrian_School \"Austrian School\"), such as [Leland\nYeager](/wiki/Leland_Yeager \"Leland Yeager\").[13] However, marginal\nproductivity ethics were defended by [George Stigler](/wiki/George_Stigler\n\"George Stigler\").\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Marginal_product_of_labor&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Marginal product of capital](/wiki/Marginal_product_of_capital \"Marginal product of capital\")\n\n##\nFootnotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Marginal_product_of_labor&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Footnotes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [O'Sullivan, Arthur](/wiki/Arthur_O%27Sullivan_\\(economist\\) \"Arthur O'Sullivan \\(economist\\)\"); Sheffrin, Steven M.
