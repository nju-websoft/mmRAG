[digital](/wiki/Digital_media\n\"Digital media\") [optical disc](/wiki/Optical_disc \"Optical disc\") [data\nstorage](/wiki/Data_storage \"Data storage\") format. It was designed to\nsupersede the [DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") format, and is capable of storing several\nhours of video in [high-definition](/wiki/HD_TV \"HD TV\") (HDTV 720p and 1080p)\nand [ultra high-definition](/wiki/4K_resolution \"4K resolution\") resolution\n([2160p](/wiki/2160p \"2160p\")). The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium\nfor video material such as [feature films](/wiki/Feature_film \"Feature film\")\nand for the physical distribution of video games for the [PlayStation\n3](/wiki/PlayStation_3 \"PlayStation 3\"), [PlayStation 4](/wiki/PlayStation_4\n\"PlayStation 4\") and [Xbox One](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox One\"). The name \"Blu-ray\"\nrefers to the [blue laser](/wiki/Blue_laser \"Blue laser\") (actually a\n[violet](/wiki/Violet_\\(color\\) \"Violet \\(color\\)\") laser) used to read the\ndisc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is\npossible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs.\n\nThe plastic disc is 120 millimetres (4.7 in) in diameter and 1.2 millimetres\n(0.047 in) thick, the same size as DVDs and [CDs](/wiki/Compact_disc \"Compact\ndisc\").[5] Conventional or pre-BD-XL Blu-ray discs contain 25\n[GB](/wiki/Gigabyte \"Gigabyte\") per layer, with dual layer discs (50 GB) being\nthe industry standard for feature-length video discs. Triple-layer discs (100\nGB) and quadruple-layer discs (200/300 GB) are available for _BD-XL_ re-writer\ndrives.[6]\n\nHigh-definition (HD) video may be stored on Blu-ray discs with up to 2160p\nresolution (3840×2160 pixels) and at up to 60 [frames per\nsecond](/wiki/Frames_per_second \"Frames per second\"). [DVD-Video](/wiki/DVD-\nVideo \"DVD-Video\") discs were limited to a maximum resolution of 480p\n([NTSC](/wiki/NTSC \"NTSC\"), 720×480 pixels) or 576p ([PAL](/wiki/PAL \"PAL\"),\n720×576 pixels).[7] Besides these hardware specifications, Blu-ray is\nassociated with a set of [multimedia](/wiki/Multimedia \"Multimedia\") formats.\n\nThe BD format was developed by the [Blu-ray Disc Association](/wiki/Blu-\nray_Disc_Association \"Blu-ray Disc Association\"), a group representing makers\nof consumer electronics, computer hardware, and motion pictures.\n[Sony](/wiki/Sony \"Sony\") unveiled the first Blu-ray disc prototypes in\nOctober 2000, and the first prototype player was released in April 2003 in\nJapan. Afterwards, it continued to be developed until its official release on\nJune 20, 2006, beginning the [high definition optical disc format\nwar](/wiki/High_definition_optical_disc_format_war \"High definition optical\ndisc format war\"), where Blu-ray Disc competed with the [HD DVD](/wiki/HD_DVD\n\"HD DVD\") format. [Toshiba](/wiki/Toshiba \"Toshiba\"), the main company\nsupporting HD DVD, conceded in February 2008,[8] and later released its own\nBlu-ray Disc player in late 2009.[9] According to Media Research, high-\ndefinition software sales in the United States were slower in the first two\nyears than DVD software sales.[10] Blu-ray faces competition from [video on\ndemand (VOD)](/wiki/Video_on_demand \"Video on demand\") and the continued sale\nof DVDs.[11] Notably, as of January 2016, 44% of U.S.\n[broadband](/wiki/Broadband \"Broadband\") households had a Blu-ray player.[12]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Early history\n    * 1.2 Launch and sales developments\n    * 1.3 Competition from HD DVD\n    * 1.4 Future scope and market trends\n      * 1.4.1 Beyond Blu-ray Disc\n      * 1.4.2 Ongoing development\n  * 2 Physical media\n    * 2.1 Laser and optics\n    * 2.2 Hard-coating technology\n    * 2.3 Drive speeds\n    * 2.4 Packaging\n    * 2.5 Variants\n      * 2.5.1 Mini Blu-ray Disc\n      * 2.5.2 Blu-ray Disc recordable\n      * 2.5.3 BD9 and BD5\n      * 2.5.4 BDXL\n      * 2.5.5 IH-BD\n  * 3 Data format standards\n    * 3.1 Filesystem\n    * 3.2 Application format\n    * 3.3 Directory and file structure\n    * 3.4 Media format\n      * 3.4.1 Container format\n      * 3.4.2 Codecs\n        * 3.4.2.1 Video\n        * 3.4.2.2 Audio\n      * 3.4.3 Bit rate\n    * 3.5 Java software interface\n    * 3.6 Player profiles\n      * 3.6.1 BD-Live\n    * 3.7 Region codes\n    * 3.8 Digital rights management\n      * 3.8.1 High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection\n      * 3.8.2 Advanced Access Content System\n      * 3.8.3 BD+\n      * 3.8.4 BD-ROM Mark\n  * 4 Backward compatibility\n  * 5 Variations\n    * 5.1 High Fidelity Pure Audio (BD-A)\n    * 5.2 AVCHD\n    * 5.3 AVCREC\n    * 5.4 Blu-ray 3D\n    * 5.5 Ultra HD Blu-ray\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-ray&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Blu-ray_disc_%28BD-\nRE%29.JPG/220px-Blu-ray_disc_%28BD-RE%29.JPG)](/wiki/File:Blu-ray_disc_\\(BD-\nRE\\).JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Blu-ray_disc_\\(BD-RE\\).JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA blank rewritable Blu-ray Disc ([BD-RE](/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc_recordable \"Blu-\nray Disc recordable\"))\n\n### Early history[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-ray&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Early history\")]\n\nThe information density of the [DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") format was limited by\nthe wavelength of the [laser diodes](/wiki/Laser_diode \"Laser diode\") used.\nFollowing protracted development, [blue laser](/wiki/Blue_laser \"Blue laser\")\ndiodes operating at 405 [nanometers](/wiki/Nanometre \"Nanometre\") became\navailable on a production basis. [Sony](/wiki/Sony \"Sony\") started two\nprojects in collaboration with [Philips](/wiki/Philips \"Philips\")[13] applying\nthe new diodes: [UDO](/wiki/Ultra_Density_Optical \"Ultra Density Optical\")\n(Ultra Density Optical),[14] and DVR Blue (together with\n[Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer_Corporation \"Pioneer Corporation\")),[15] a format of\nrewritable discs that would eventually become Blu-ray Disc (more specifically,\nBD-RE). The core technologies of the formats are similar. The first DVR Blue\nprototypes were unveiled at the [CEATEC](/wiki/CEATEC \"CEATEC\") exhibition in\nOctober 2000 by [Sony](/wiki/Sony \"Sony\").[16] A trademark for the \"Blue Disc\"\nlogo was filed February 9, 2001.[17] On February 19, 2002, the project was\nofficially announced as Blu-ray Disc,[18][19] and [Blu-ray Disc\nFounders](/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc_Founders \"Blu-ray Disc Founders\") was founded by\nthe nine initial members.\n\nThe first consumer device arrived in stores on April 10, 2003: the Sony\nBDZ-S77, a $3,800 (US) BD-RE recorder that was made available only in\nJapan.[20] But there was no standard for prerecorded video, and no movies were\nreleased for this player. Hollywood studios insisted that players be equipped\nwith [digital rights management](/wiki/Digital_rights_management \"Digital\nrights management\") before they would release movies for the new format, and\nthey wanted a new DRM system that would be more secure than the failed\n[Content Scramble System](/wiki/Content_Scramble_System \"Content Scramble\nSystem\") (CSS) used on DVDs. On October 4, 2004, the name \"Blu-ray Disc\nFounders\" was officially changed to the [Blu-ray Disc Association](/wiki/Blu-\nray_Disc_Association \"Blu-ray Disc Association\") (BDA), and [20th Century\nFox](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox \"20th Century Fox\") joined the BDA's Board of\nDirectors.[21] The Blu-ray Disc physical specifications were completed in\n2004.[22]\n\nIn January 2005, [TDK](/wiki/TDK \"TDK\") announced that they had now developed\nan ultra-hard yet very thin polymer coating (\"[Durabis](/wiki/Durabis\n\"Durabis\")\") for Blu-ray discs; this was a significant technical advance\nbecause a far tougher protection was desired in the consumer market to protect\nbare discs against scratching and damage compared to DVD, while technically\nBlu-ray Disc required a much _thinner_ layer for the denser and higher\nfrequency blue laser.[23] Cartridges, originally used for scratch protection,\nwere no longer necessary and were scrapped. The BD-ROM specifications were\nfinalized in early 2006.[24]\n\nAACS LA, a consortium founded in 2004,[25] had been developing the DRM\nplatform that could be used to securely distribute movies to consumers.\nHowever, the final AACS standard was delayed,[26] and then delayed again when\nan important member of the Blu-ray Disc group voiced concerns.[27] At the\nrequest of the initial hardware manufacturers, including Toshiba, Pioneer, and\nSamsung, an interim standard was published that did not include some features,\nsuch as managed copy.[28]\n\n### Launch and sales developments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-\nray&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Launch and sales developments\")]\n\nThe first BD-ROM players (Samsung BD-P1000) were shipped in mid-June 2006,\nthough [HD DVD](/wiki/HD_DVD \"HD DVD\") players beat them to market by a few\nmonths.[29][30] The first Blu-ray Disc titles were released on June 20, 2006:\n_[50 First Dates](/wiki/50_First_Dates \"50 First Dates\")_ , _[The Fifth\nElement](/wiki/The_Fifth_Element \"The Fifth Element\")_ ,\n_[Hitch](/wiki/Hitch_\\(film\\) \"Hitch \\(film\\)\")_ , _[House of Flying\nDaggers](/wiki/House_of_Flying_Daggers \"House of Flying Daggers\")_ ,\n_[Underworld: Evolution](/wiki/Underworld:_Evolution \"Underworld: Evolution\")_\n, _[xXx](/wiki/XXX_\\(2002_film\\) \"XXX \\(2002 film\\)\")_ (all [Sony](/wiki/Sony\n\"Sony\")), _[Twister](/wiki/Twister_\\(1996_film\\) \"Twister \\(1996 film\\)\")_\n([Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\")), and [MGM](/wiki/Metro-\nGoldwyn-Mayer \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\")'s _[The Terminator](/wiki/The_Terminator\n\"The Terminator\")_.[31] The earliest releases used [MPEG-2](/wiki/MPEG-2\n\"MPEG-2\") video compression, the same method used on standard DVDs. The first\nreleases using the newer [VC-1](/wiki/VC-1 \"VC-1\") and\n[AVC](/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC \"H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\") formats were introduced in\nSeptember 2006.[32] The first movies using 50 GB dual-layer discs were\nintroduced in October 2006.[33] The first audio-only albums were released in\nMay 2008.[34][35]\n\nThe first mass-market Blu-ray Disc rewritable drive for the PC was the\nBWU-100A, released by [Sony](/wiki/Sony \"Sony\") on July 18, 2006.[36] It\nrecorded both single and dual-layer BD-Rs as well as BD-REs and had a\nsuggested retail price of US $699. As of June\n2008[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blu-ray&action=edit), more\nthan 2,500 Blu-ray Disc titles were available in Australia and the United\nKingdom, with 3,500 in the United States and Canada.[37] In Japan, as of July\n2010[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blu-ray&action=edit), more\nthan 3,300 titles have been released.[38]\n\n### Competition from HD DVD[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-\nray&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Competition from HD DVD\")]\n\nMain article: [High definition optical disc format\nwar](/wiki/High_definition_optical_disc_format_war \"High definition optical\ndisc format war\")\n\nThe [DVD Forum](/wiki/DVD_Forum \"DVD Forum\"), chaired by\n[Toshiba](/wiki/Toshiba \"Toshiba\"), was split over whether to develop the more\nexpensive blue laser technology. In March 2002 the forum approved a proposal,\nwhich was endorsed by [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") and\nother [motion picture studios](/wiki/Film_studio \"Film studio\"). The proposal\ninvolved compressing HD video onto dual-layer standard [DVD-9](/wiki/DVD-9\n\"DVD-9\") discs.[39][40] In spite of this decision, however, the DVD Forum's\nSteering Committee announced in April that it was pursuing its own blue-laser\n[high-definition video](/wiki/High-definition_video \"High-definition video\")\nsolution. In August, Toshiba and NEC announced their competing standard,\nAdvanced Optical Disc.[41] It was finally adopted by the DVD Forum and renamed\n[HD DVD](/wiki/HD_DVD \"HD DVD\") the next year,[42] after being voted down\ntwice by DVD Forum members who were also Blu-ray Disc Association members—a\nsituation that drew preliminary investigations by the U.S. Department of\nJustice.[43]\n\nHD DVD had a head start in the high-definition video market, as Blu-ray Disc\nsales were slow to gain market share. The first Blu-ray Disc player was\nperceived as expensive and buggy, and there were few titles available.[44]\n\nThe appearance of the Sony [PlayStation 3](/wiki/PlayStation_3 \"PlayStation\n3\"), which contained a Blu-ray Disc player for primary storage, helped support\nBlu-ray.[45] Sony also ran a more thorough and influential marketing campaign\nfor the format.[46] [AVCHD](/wiki/AVCHD \"AVCHD\") camcorders were also\nintroduced in 2006. These recordings can be played back on many Blu-ray Disc\nplayers without re-encoding but are not compatible with HD DVD players. By\nJanuary 2007, Blu-ray Discs had outsold HD DVDs,[47] and during the first\nthree-quarters of 2007, BD outsold HD DVD by about two to one. At [CES\n2007](/wiki/International_CES \"International CES\"), Warner proposed [Total Hi\nDef](/wiki/Total_Hi_Def \"Total Hi Def\")—a hybrid disc containing Blu-ray on\none side and HD DVD on the other, but it was never released.\n\nIn a June 28, 2007, press release, Twentieth Century Fox cited Blu-ray Disc's\nadoption of the BD+ anticopying system as key to their decision to support the\nBlu-ray Disc format.[48][49] On January 4, 2008, a day before\n[CES](/wiki/International_CES \"International CES\") 2008, [Warner\nBros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") (the only major studio still\nreleasing movies in both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc format) announced that it\nwould release only in Blu-ray Disc after May 2008.[50] This effectively\nincluded other studios that came under the Warner umbrella, such as [New Line\nCinema](/wiki/New_Line_Cinema \"New Line Cinema\") and [HBO](/wiki/HBO\n\"HBO\")—though in Europe, HBO distribution partner, the [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\"),\nannounced it would, while keeping an eye on market forces, continue to release\nproduct on both formats.

A\nstudy by The [NPD Group](/wiki/NPD_Group \"NPD Group\") found that awareness of\nBlu-ray Disc had reached 60% of U.S. households. Nielsen VideoScan sales\nnumbers showed that for some titles, such as 20th Century Fox's _Hitman_ , up\nto 14% of total disc sales were from Blu-ray, although the average Blu-ray\nsales for the first half of the year were only around 5%. In December 2008,\nthe Blu-ray Disc version of _[The Dark Knight](/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_\\(film\\)\n\"The Dark Knight \\(film\\)\")_ sold 600,000 copies on the first day of its\nlaunch in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[59] A week after\nthe launch, _The Dark Knight_ BD had sold over 1.7 million copies worldwide,\nmaking it the first Blu-ray Disc title to sell over a million copies in the\nfirst week of release.[60]\n\nBlu-ray Disc sales in United States and Canada  Year  | Cumulative sales (millions)   \n---|---  \n2006 | 1.2[61]  \n2007 | 19.2[61]  \n2008 | 82.9[61]  \n2009 | 177.2[61]  \n2010 | 350[62]  \n  \nAccording to [Singulus Technologies](/wiki/Singulus_Technologies \"Singulus\nTechnologies\") AG, Blu-ray is being adopted faster than the DVD format was at\na similar period in its development. This conclusion was based on the fact\nthat Singulus Technologies has received orders for 21 Blu-ray dual-layer\nmachines during the first quarter of 2008, while 17 DVD machines of this type\nwere made in the same period in 1997.[63] According to GfK Retail and\nTechnology, in the first week of November 2008, sales of Blu-ray recorders\nsurpassed DVD recorders in Japan.[64] According to the Digital Entertainment\nGroup, the number of Blu-ray Disc playback devices (both set-top box and game\nconsole) sold in the U.S. had reached 28.5 million by the end of 2010.[62]\n\nBlu-ray faces competition from [video on demand](/wiki/Video_on_demand \"Video\non demand\")[65] and from new technologies that allow access to movies on any\nformat or device, such as [Digital Entertainment Content\nEcosystem](/wiki/Digital_Entertainment_Content_Ecosystem \"Digital\nEntertainment Content Ecosystem\") or Disney's [Keychest](/wiki/Keychest\n\"Keychest\").[66] Some commentators have suggested that renting Blu-ray will\nplay a vital part in keeping the technology affordable while allowing it to\nmove forward.[67] In an effort to increase sales, studios are releasing movies\nin combo packs with Blu-ray Discs and DVDs as well as [digital\ncopies](/wiki/Digital_copy \"Digital copy\") that can be played on computers and\nmobile devices. Some are released on \"flipper\" discs with Blu-ray on one side\nand DVD on the other.

By 2005, quad-layer (128 GB) discs had\nbeen demonstrated on a drive with modified optics[72] and standard unaltered\noptics.[73] Hitachi stated that such a disc could be used to store 7 hours of\n32 Mbit/s video (HDTV) or 3 hours and 30 minutes of 64 Mbit/s video ([Ultra\nhigh definition television](/wiki/Ultra_high_definition_television \"Ultra high\ndefinition television\")). In August 2006, [TDK](/wiki/TDK \"TDK\") announced\nthat they had created a working experimental Blu-ray Disc capable of holding\n200 GB of data on a single side, using six 33 GB data layers.[74]\n\nAlso, behind closed doors at [CES](/wiki/International_CES \"International\nCES\") 2007, [Ritek](/wiki/Ritek \"Ritek\") revealed that they had successfully\ndeveloped a High Definition optical disc process that extends the disc\ncapacity to ten layers, which increases the capacity of the discs to 250 GB.\nHowever, they noted that the major obstacle is that current read/write\ntechnology does not allow additional layers.[75] [JVC](/wiki/JVC \"JVC\") has\ndeveloped a three-layer technology that allows putting both standard-\ndefinition DVD data and HD data on a BD/(standard) DVD combination.[76] This\nwould have enabled the consumer to purchase a disc that can be played on DVD\nplayers and can also reveal its HD version when played on a BD player.[77]\nJapanese optical disc manufacturer Infinity announced the first \"hybrid\" Blu-\nray Disc/(standard) DVD combo, to be released February 18, 2009. This disc set\nof the TV series \"Code Blue\" featured four hybrid discs containing a single\nBlu-ray Disc layer (25 GB) and two DVD layers (9 GB) on the same side of the\ndisc.[78]\n\nIn January 2007, [Hitachi](/wiki/Hitachi \"Hitachi\") showcased a 100 GB Blu-ray\nDisc, consisting of four layers containing 25 GB each.[79] Unlike\n[TDK](/wiki/TDK \"TDK\") and [Panasonic](/wiki/Panasonic \"Panasonic\")'s 100 GB\ndiscs, they claim this disc is readable on standard Blu-ray Disc drives that\nare currently in circulation, and it is believed that a firmware update is the\nonly requirement to make it readable to current players and drives.[80] In\nDecember 2008, [Pioneer Corporation](/wiki/Pioneer_Corporation \"Pioneer\nCorporation\") unveiled a 400 GB Blu-ray Disc (containing 16 data layers, 25 GB\neach) that will be compatible with current players after a firmware update.\nIts planned launch was in the 2009–10 time frame for ROM and 2010–13 for\nrewritable discs. Ongoing development was underway to create a 1\n[TB](/wiki/Terabyte \"Terabyte\") Blu-ray Disc.[81]\n\nAt CES 2009, Panasonic unveiled the DMP-B15, the first portable Blu-ray Disc\nplayer, and [Sharp](/wiki/Sharp_Corporation \"Sharp Corporation\") introduced\nthe LC-BD60U and LC-BD80U series, the first LCD HDTVs with integrated Blu-ray\nDisc players. Sharp has also announced that they will sell HDTVs with\nintegrated Blu-ray Disc recorders in the United States by the end of 2009.\nSet-top box recorders were not being sold in the U.S. for fear of unauthorized\ncopying. However, personal computers with Blu-ray recorder drives were\navailable. On January 1, 2010, Sony, in association with Panasonic, announced\nplans to increase the storage capacity on their Blu-ray Discs from 25 GB to\n33.4 GB via a technology called i-MLSE ([Maximum\nlikelihood](/wiki/Maximum_likelihood \"Maximum likelihood\") Sequence\nEstimation). The higher-capacity discs, according to Sony, would be readable\non existing Blu-ray Disc players with a firmware upgrade.[82]This technology\nis later used on BDXL discs.[83]\n\nOn July 20, 2010, the research team of Sony and Japanese Tohoku University\nannounced the joint development of a blue-violet laser,[84] to help create\nBlu-ray discs with a capacity of 1 TB using only two layers (and potentially\nmore than 1 TB with additional layering). By comparison, the first blue laser\nwas invented in 1996, with the first prototype discs coming four years later.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/4K_Blu_Ray_early_Best_Buy_release.jpg/220px-4K_Blu_Ray_early_Best_Buy_release.jpg)](/wiki/File:4K_Blu_Ray_early_Best_Buy_release.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:4K_Blu_Ray_early_Best_Buy_release.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nEarly 4K Blu-ray release at [Best Buy](/wiki/Best_Buy \"Best Buy\").

The\nUltra HD Blu-ray format delivered high dynamic range content that\nsignificantly expanded the range between the brightest and darkest elements,\nexpanded color range, high frame rate (up to 60fps) and up to 3840×2160\nresolution, object-based sound formats, and an optional \"digital bridge\"\nfeature. New players were required to play this format, which were able to\nplay both DVDs, traditional Blu-rays and the new format.

Although the laser is called \"blue\",\nits color is actually in the [violet](/wiki/Violet_\\(color\\) \"Violet\n\\(color\\)\") range. The shorter wavelength can be focused to a smaller area,\nthus enabling it to read information recorded in pits that are less than half\nthe size of those on a DVD, and can consequently be spaced more closely,\nresulting in a shorter track pitch, enabling a Blu-ray Disc to hold about five\ntimes the amount of information that can be stored on a DVD. The lasers are\n[GaN](/wiki/Gallium_nitride \"Gallium nitride\") (gallium nitride) laser diodes\nthat produce 405 nm light directly, that is, without [frequency\ndoubling](/wiki/Second-harmonic_generation \"Second-harmonic generation\") or\nother [nonlinear optical](/wiki/Nonlinear_optics \"Nonlinear optics\")\nmechanisms.[91] Conventional [DVDs](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") use 650 nm red lasers,\nand [CDs](/wiki/Compact_Disc \"Compact Disc\") use 780 nm near-infrared lasers.\n\nThe minimum \"[spot size](/wiki/Angular_resolution \"Angular resolution\")\" on\nwhich a laser can be focused is limited by [diffraction](/wiki/Diffraction\n\"Diffraction\") and depends on the wavelength of the light and the [numerical\naperture](/wiki/Numerical_aperture \"Numerical aperture\") of the\n[lens](/wiki/Lens_\\(optics\\) \"Lens \\(optics\\)\") used to focus it. By\ndecreasing the wavelength, increasing the numerical aperture from 0.60 to\n0.85, and making the cover layer thinner to avoid unwanted optical effects,\ndesigners can cause the laser beam to focus on a smaller spot, which\neffectively allows more information to be stored in the same area.[92] For\nBlu-ray Disc, the spot size is 580 nm.[93] This allows a reduction of the pit\nsize from 400 nm for DVD to 150 nm for Blu-ray Disc, and of the track pitch\nfrom 740 nm to 320 nm.[92] See _[Compact Disc](/wiki/Compact_Disc \"Compact\nDisc\")_ for information on optical discs' physical structure. In addition to\nthe optical improvements, Blu-ray Discs feature improvements in data encoding\nthat further increase the amount of content that can be stored.[94]\n\n### Hard-coating technology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-\nray&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Hard-coating technology\")]\n\nSince the Blu-ray Disc data layer is closer to the surface of the disc\ncompared to the [DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") standard, it was more vulnerable to\nscratches in early designs.[95] The first discs were therefore housed in\n[cartridges](/wiki/Caddy_\\(hardware\\) \"Caddy \\(hardware\\)\") for protection,\nresembling [Professional Discs](/wiki/Professional_Disc \"Professional Disc\")\nintroduced by Sony in 2003. Using a cartridge would increase the price of an\nalready expensive medium, so designers chose hard-coating of the pickup\nsurface instead. [TDK](/wiki/TDK \"TDK\") was the first company to develop a\nworking scratch-protection coating for Blu-ray Discs, naming it\n[Durabis](/wiki/Durabis \"Durabis\"). In addition, both Sony's and Panasonic's\nreplication methods include proprietary hard-coat technologies. Sony's\nrewritable media are spin-coated, using a scratch-resistant and antistatic\ncoating. [Verbatim's](/wiki/Verbatim_Corporation \"Verbatim Corporation\")\nrecordable and rewritable Blu-ray Discs use their own proprietary technology,\ncalled Hard Coat.[96]\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc specification requires the testing of resistance to scratches\nby [mechanical abrasion](/wiki/Abrasion_\\(mechanical\\) \"Abrasion\n\\(mechanical\\)\").[92] In contrast, DVD media are not required to be scratch-\nresistant, but since development of the technology, some companies, such as\nVerbatim, implemented hard-coating for more expensive lines of recordable\nDVDs.\n\n### Drive speeds[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-ray&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Drive speeds\")]\n\nBD drive speeds  Drive speed  | Data rate  | ~Write time (minutes)   \n---|---|---  \n[Mbit/s](/wiki/Mbit/s \"Mbit/s\") | [MB/s](/wiki/MB/s \"MB/s\") | Single-Layer | Dual-Layer   \n1× | 36 | 4.5 | 90 | 180   \n2× | 72 | 9 | 45 | 90   \n4× | 144 | 18 | 22.5 | 45   \n6× | 216 | 27 | 15 | 30   \n8× | 288 | 36 | 11.25 | 22.5   \n10× | 360 | 45 | 9 | 18   \n12×  | 432 | 54 | 7.5 | 15   \n14×  | 504 | 63 | 6.5 | 13   \n16×  | 576 | 72 | 5.7 | 11.5   \n  \nThe table shows the speeds available.

The\ncurrent practical maximum speed for Blu-ray Discs is about 12× (54\nMB/s).[105](1.7) Higher speeds of rotation (10,000+ rpm) cause too much wobble\nfor the discs to be written properly,[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] as with\nthe 20× (27.7 MB/s) and 52×(7.8 MB/s) maximum speeds, respectively, of\nstandard [DVDs](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") and [CDs](/wiki/Compact_Disc \"Compact Disc\").\nSince September 2007, [BD-RE](/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc_recordable \"Blu-ray Disc\nrecordable\") is also available in the smaller 8 cm Mini Blu-ray Disc\nsize.[104][106]\n\nOn September 18, 2007, [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer_Corporation \"Pioneer\nCorporation\") and [Mitsubishi](/wiki/Mitsubishi \"Mitsubishi\") codeveloped BD-R\nLTH (\"Low to High\" in groove recording), which features an\n[organic](/wiki/Organic_compound \"Organic compound\") dye recording layer that\ncan be manufactured by modifying existing CD-R and DVD-R production equipment,\nsignificantly reducing manufacturing costs.[107] In February 2008, [Taiyo\nYuden](/wiki/Taiyo_Yuden \"Taiyo Yuden\"), Mitsubishi, and\n[Maxell](/wiki/Hitachi_Maxell \"Hitachi Maxell\") released the first BD-R LTH\nDiscs,[108] and in March 2008, Sony's PlayStation 3 officially gained the\nability to use BD-R LTH Discs with the 2.20 firmware update.[109] In May 2009\nVerbatim/Mitsubishi announced the industry's first 6X BD-R LTH media, which\nallows recording a 25 GB disc in about 16 minutes.[110] Unlike with the\nprevious releases of 120 mm [optical discs](/wiki/Optical_disc \"Optical disc\")\n(i.e. [CDs](/wiki/Compact_disc \"Compact disc\") and standard [DVDs](/wiki/DVD\n\"DVD\")), Blu-ray recorders hit the market almost simultaneously with Blu-ray's\ndebut.\n\n#### BD9 and BD5[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-ray&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: BD9 and BD5\")]\n\nThe BD9 format was proposed to the Blu-ray Disc Association by [Warner Home\nVideo](/wiki/Warner_Home_Video \"Warner Home Video\") as a cost-effective\nalternative to the 25/50 GB BD-ROM discs. The format was supposed to use the\nsame codecs and program structure as Blu-ray Disc video but recorded onto less\nexpensive 8.5 GB dual-layer DVD. This red-laser media could be manufactured on\nexisting DVD production lines with lower costs of production than the 25/50 GB\nBlu-ray media.[111]\n\nUsage of BD9 for releasing content on \"pressed\" discs never caught on. With\nthe end of the format war, manufacturers ramped production of Blu-ray Discs\nand lowered prices to compete with DVDs. On the other hand, the idea of using\ninexpensive DVD media became popular among individual users. A lower-capacity\nversion of this format that uses single-layer 4.7 GB DVDs has been\nunofficially called BD5. Both formats are being used by individuals for\nrecording high definition content in Blu-ray format onto recordable DVD\nmedia.[112][113] Despite the fact that the BD9 format has been adopted as part\nof the BD-ROM basic format, none of the existing Blu-ray player models\nexplicitly claim to be able to read it.

The BDAV format is used on BD-REs and BD-Rs for audio/video\nrecording.[136] BDMV format was later defined also for BD-RE and BD-R (in\nSeptember 2006, in the third revision of BD-RE specification and second\nrevision of BD-R specification).[119][120]\n\nBlu-ray Disc employs the MPEG transport stream recording method. That enables\ntransport streams of digital broadcasts to be recorded as they are broadcast,\nwithout altering the format.[137] It also enables flexible editing of a\ndigital broadcast that is recorded as is and where the data can be edited just\nby rewriting the playback stream.

The more-\nadvanced video formats (VC-1 and MPEG-4 AVC) typically achieve a video run\ntime twice that of MPEG-2, with comparable quality.\n\nMPEG-2 was used by many studios (including [Paramount\nPictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\"), which initially used\nthe [VC-1](/wiki/VC-1 \"VC-1\") format for [HD DVD](/wiki/HD_DVD \"HD DVD\")\nreleases) for the first series of Blu-ray Discs, which were launched\nthroughout 2006.[147] Modern releases are now often encoded in either MPEG-4\nAVC or VC-1, allowing film studios to place all content on one disc, reducing\ncosts and improving ease of use. Using these formats also frees a lot of space\nfor storage of bonus content in HD ([1080i](/wiki/1080i\n\"1080i\")/[p](/wiki/1080p \"1080p\")), as opposed to the [SD](/wiki/Standard-\ndefinition_television \"Standard-definition television\") ([480i](/wiki/480i\n\"480i\")/[p](/wiki/480p \"480p\")) typically used for most titles.

Among major U.S.\nstudios, [Walt Disney Pictures](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures \"Walt Disney\nPictures\"), [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\"), [Paramount\nPictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\"), [Universal\nStudios](/wiki/Universal_Studios \"Universal Studios\"), and [Sony\nPictures](/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment \"Sony Pictures Entertainment\")\nhave released most of their titles region-free.[168][169][170][171][172][173]\n[MGM](/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\") and [Lions Gate\nEntertainment](/wiki/Lions_Gate_Entertainment \"Lions Gate Entertainment\") have\nreleased a mix of region-free and region-coded titles.[174][175] [20th Century\nFox](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox \"20th Century Fox\") has released most of their\ntitles region-coded.[176] Vintage film restoration and distribution company\n[The Criterion Collection](/wiki/The_Criterion_Collection \"The Criterion\nCollection\") uses US region coding in all Blu-ray releases.[177][178]\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc region coding scheme divides the world into three regions,\nlabeled A, B, and C.\n\nRegion code  | Area   \n---|---  \nA | The [Americas](/wiki/Americas \"Americas\") and their [dependencies](/wiki/Dependent_territory \"Dependent territory\"), [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\"), [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong \"Hong Kong\"), [Macau](/wiki/Macau \"Macau\"), [Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\"), [Korea](/wiki/Korea \"Korea\") and [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia \"Southeast Asia\"); excludes instances that fall under Region C   \nB | [Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\"), [Middle East](/wiki/Middle_East \"Middle East\"), [Southwest Asia](/wiki/Western_Asia \"Western Asia\"), most of [Europe](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\"), [United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\"), [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"), [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\"), and their [dependencies](/wiki/Dependent_territory \"Dependent territory\"); excludes instances that fall under Region C   \nC | [Central Asia](/wiki/Central_Asia \"Central Asia\"), [mainland China](/wiki/Mainland_China \"Mainland China\"), [Mongolia](/wiki/Mongolia \"Mongolia\"), [South Asia](/wiki/South_Asia \"South Asia\"), [Belarus](/wiki/Belarus \"Belarus\"), [Russia](/wiki/Russia \"Russia\"), [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine \"Ukraine\"), [Kazakhstan](/wiki/Kazakhstan \"Kazakhstan\"), [Moldova](/wiki/Moldova \"Moldova\"), and their [dependencies](/wiki/Dependent_territory \"Dependent territory\")  \nFREE | Informal term meaning \"worldwide\". Region free is not an official setting; discs that bear the region FREE symbol either have no flags set or have all three flags set.   \nABC  \n  \nIn circumvention of region coding restrictions, stand-alone Blu-ray Disc\nplayers are sometimes modified by third parties to allow for playback of Blu-\nray Discs (and DVDs) with _any_ region code.[179] Instructions (\"hacks\")\ndescribing how to reset the Blu-ray region counter of computer player\napplications to make them multi-region indefinitely are also regularly posted\nto video enthusiast websites and forums. Unlike DVD region codes, Blu-ray\nregion codes are verified only by the player software, not by the [optical\ndrive's firmware](/wiki/Regional_Playback_Control \"Regional Playback\nControl\").\n\nThe latest type of Blu-Ray disc, suitable for [UltraHD](/wiki/UltraHD\n\"UltraHD\") content, is region-free.[180]\n\n### Digital rights management[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-\nray&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit section: Digital rights management\")]\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc format employs several layers of [digital rights\nmanagement](/wiki/Digital_rights_management \"Digital rights management\") (DRM)\nwhich restrict the usage of the discs.[181][182] This has led to extensive\ncriticism of the format by organizations [opposed to\nDRM](/wiki/Digital_rights_management \"Digital rights management\"), such as the\n[Free Software Foundation](/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation \"Free Software\nFoundation\"),[183] and consumers because new releases require player firmware\nupdates to allow disc playback.[184][185]\n\n#### High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-\nray&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit section: High-bandwidth Digital Content\nProtection\")]\n\nBlu-ray equipment is required to implement the High-bandwidth Digital Content\nProtection ([HDCP](/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection \"High-\nbandwidth Digital Content Protection\")) system to encrypt the data sent by\nplayers to rendering devices through physical connections. This is aimed at\npreventing the copying of copyrighted content as it travels across cables.\nThrough a [protocol flag](/wiki/Flag_\\(computing\\) \"Flag \\(computing\\)\") in\nthe media stream called the [Image Constraint\nToken](/wiki/Image_Constraint_Token \"Image Constraint Token\") (ICT), a Blu-ray\nDisc can enforce its reproduction in a lower resolution whenever a full HDCP-\ncompliant link is not used. In order to ease the transition to high definition\nformats, the adoption of this protection method was postponed until 2011.[186]\n\n#### Advanced Access Content System[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-\nray&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit section: Advanced Access Content System\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/AACS_dataflow.svg/220px-\nAACS_dataflow.svg.png)](/wiki/File:AACS_dataflow.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AACS_dataflow.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe AACS decryption process\n\nThe [Advanced Access Content System](/wiki/Advanced_Access_Content_System\n\"Advanced Access Content System\") (AACS) is a standard for [content\ndistribution](/wiki/Digital_distribution \"Digital distribution\") and [digital\nrights management](/wiki/Digital_rights_management \"Digital rights\nmanagement\"). It was developed by AS Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA), a\n[consortium](/wiki/Consortium \"Consortium\") that includes\n[Disney](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company \"The Walt Disney Company\"),\n[Intel](/wiki/Intel \"Intel\"), [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\"),\n[Panasonic](/wiki/Panasonic \"Panasonic\"), [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros.\n\"Warner Bros.\"), [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\"), [Toshiba](/wiki/Toshiba \"Toshiba\"),\nand [Sony](/wiki/Sony \"Sony\"). Since the appearance of the format on devices\nin 2006, [several successful\nattacks](/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy#TIMELINE \"AACS encryption key\ncontroversy\") have been made on it. The first known attack relied on the\n[trusted client](/wiki/Trusted_client \"Trusted client\") problem. In addition,\ndecryption keys have been extracted from a weakly protected player\n([WinDVD](/wiki/WinDVD \"WinDVD\")). Since keys can be revoked in newer\nreleases,[187] this is only a temporary attack, and new keys must continually\nbe discovered in order to decrypt the latest discs.\n\n#### BD+[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-ray&action=edit&section=36 \"Edit\nsection: BD+\")]\n\n[BD+](/wiki/BD%2B \"BD+\") was developed by [Cryptography Research\nInc.](/wiki/Cryptography_Research \"Cryptography Research\") and is based on\ntheir concept of [Self-Protecting Digital Content](/wiki/Self-\nProtecting_Digital_Content \"Self-Protecting Digital Content\").[188] BD+,\neffectively a small [virtual machine](/wiki/Virtual_machine \"Virtual machine\")\nembedded in authorized players, allows content providers to include executable\nprograms on Blu-ray Discs. Such programs can:[181]\n\n  * Examine the host environment to see if the player has been tampered with. Every licensed playback device manufacturer must provide the BD+ licensing authority with memory footprints that identify their devices.\n  * Verify that the player's keys have not been changed\n  * Execute native code, possibly to patch an otherwise insecure system\n  * Transform the audio and video output. Parts of the content will not be viewable without letting the BD+ program unscramble it.\n\nIf a playback device manufacturer finds that its devices have been hacked, it\ncan potentially release BD+ code that detects and circumvents the\nvulnerability. These programs can then be included in all new content\nreleases.[189] The specifications of the BD+ virtual machine are available\nonly to licensed device manufacturers. A list of licensed commercial adopters\nis available from the [BD+\nwebsite](https://web.archive.org/web/20071106054231/http://www.bdplusllc.com/home/list_of_adopters_content_participants_and_eligible_code_developers).\n\nThe first titles using BD+ were released in October 2007. Since November 2007,\nversions of BD+ protection have been circumvented by various versions of the\n[AnyDVD](/wiki/AnyDVD \"AnyDVD\") HD program.[190][191] Other programs known to\nbe capable of circumventing BD+ protection are [DumpHD](/wiki/DumpHD \"DumpHD\")\n(versions 0.6 and above, along with some supporting software),[192]\n[MakeMKV](/w/index.php?title=MakeMKV&action=edit&redlink=1 \"MakeMKV \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\"),[193] and two applications from DVDFab (Passkey and HD\nDecrypter[194]).\n\n#### BD-ROM Mark[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-ray&action=edit&section=37\n\"Edit section: BD-ROM Mark\")]\n\n[BD-ROM Mark](/wiki/ROM_Mark \"ROM Mark\") is a small amount of cryptographic\ndata that is stored separately from normal Blu-ray Disc data, aiming to\nprevent replication of the discs. The cryptographic data is needed to decrypt\nthe copyrighted disc content protected by AACS.[195] A specially licensed\npiece of hardware is required to insert the ROM-Mark into the media during\nmastering. During replication, this ROM Mark is transferred together with the\nrecorded data to the disc. In consequence, any copies of a disc made with a\nregular recorder will lack the ROM-Mark data and will be unreadable on\nstandard players.\n\n## Backward compatibility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-\nray&action=edit&section=38 \"Edit section: Backward compatibility\")]\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc Association recommends but does not require that Blu-ray Disc\ndrives be capable of reading standard DVDs and CDs, for [backward\ncompatibility](/wiki/Backward_compatibility \"Backward compatibility\").[196]\nMost Blu-ray Disc players are capable of reading both CDs and DVDs; however, a\nfew of the early Blu-ray Disc players released in 2006, such as the [Sony\nBDP-S1](/wiki/Sony_BDP-S1 \"Sony BDP-S1\"), could play DVDs but not\nCDs.[197][198][199] In addition, Blu-ray players cannot play [HD\nDVDs](/wiki/HD_DVD \"HD DVD\"), and [HD DVD](/wiki/HD_DVD \"HD DVD\") players\ncannot play Blu-ray discs. Some Blu-ray players can also play [Video\nCDs](/wiki/Video_CD \"Video CD\"), and all 4k Blu-ray players can play regular\nBlu-ray discs, and most can play [DVDs](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") and [CDs](/wiki/CD\n\"CD\").

Nevertheless, many such devices are capable of\nplaying AVCHD recordings from removable media, such as DVDs,\n[SD](/wiki/Secure_Digital \"Secure Digital\")/[SDHC](/wiki/Secure_Digital\n\"Secure Digital\") memory cards, \"[Memory Stick](/wiki/Memory_Stick \"Memory\nStick\")\" cards, and [hard disk drives](/wiki/Hard_disk_drive \"Hard disk\ndrive\").[200]\n\n### AVCREC[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Blu-ray&action=edit&section=42 \"Edit\nsection: AVCREC\")]\n\nMain article: [AVCREC](/wiki/AVCREC \"AVCREC\")\n\nAVCREC uses a BDAV container to record high definition content on conventional\nDVDs.[201] Presently AVCREC is tightly integrated with the Japanese\n[ISDB](/wiki/ISDB \"ISDB\") broadcast standard and is not marketed outside of\nJapan.
