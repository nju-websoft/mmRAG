The single remained at the\ntop of the [Billboard Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")\nchart for three consecutive weeks from March 9 to March 23, 1985.[3]\n\nThe song first appeared on REO Speedwagon's 1984 album _[Wheels Are\nTurnin'](/wiki/Wheels_Are_Turnin%27 \"Wheels Are Turnin'\")_. It was the group's\nsecond number-one hit on the U.S. charts (the first being 1981's \"[Keep on\nLoving You](/wiki/Keep_on_Loving_You_\\(song\\) \"Keep on Loving You \\(song\\)\")\",\nalso written by [Kevin Cronin](/wiki/Kevin_Cronin \"Kevin Cronin\")) and reached\nnumber sixteen in the UK.[4] \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" has appeared on dozens\nof 'various artists' [compilation albums](/wiki/Compilation_album \"Compilation\nalbum\"), as well as several REO Speedwagon greatest hits albums.[5]\n\nREO Speedwagon performed the song at the 1985 [Live Aid](/wiki/Live_Aid \"Live\nAid\") concert; they were introduced by [Chevy Chase](/wiki/Chevy_Chase \"Chevy\nChase\"), mentioning that the song was a number-one single at the moment in the\nUnited States.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Music video\n  * 2 In popular culture\n  * 3 Personnel\n  * 4 Chart performance\n    * 4.1 Weekly charts\n    * 4.2 Year-end charts\n    * 4.3 Certifications\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Music\nvideo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Can%27t_Fight_This_Feeling&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Music video\")]\n\nTwo different music videos exist for the song. One is a basic video, appearing\nalmost homemade, featuring the band in the studio. It begins with [Kevin\nCronin](/wiki/Kevin_Cronin \"Kevin Cronin\") playing the piano, attempting to\nfind the key in which he can best sing the song (starting off in G major, he\nlater decides he can sing it better in A). After Cronin exchanges some laughs\nwith his bandmates, the song officially begins; the video essentially consists\nof the band members lip-synching to the original track of the song. It then\nconcludes with Cronin uttering the line, \"That warmed the cockles of my\ncockles!\"[6] The other version of the video is much more \"professional,\" and\nmakes various references to the life-cycle.[7] Both videos have been shown at\nvarious times on VH1 Classic (now known as [MTV\nClassic](/wiki/MTV_Classic_\\(U.S._TV_network\\) \"MTV Classic \\(U.S. TV\nnetwork\\)\")).\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Can%27t_Fight_This_Feeling&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: In popular culture\")]\n\nIt was referred to in [The CW](/wiki/The_CW \"The CW\") show\n_[Supernatural](/wiki/Supernatural_\\(U.S._TV_series\\) \"Supernatural \\(U.S. TV\nseries\\)\")_ , in season 2 episode 5, \"Simon Said\".

Later, he\nsings it in the car (claiming the song had stuck in his head to a very\nconfused [Sam Winchester](/wiki/Sam_Winchester \"Sam Winchester\")).[8] It was\nalso featured in the [South Park](/wiki/South_Park \"South Park\") episode [Miss\nTeacher Bangs a Boy](/wiki/Miss_Teacher_Bangs_a_Boy \"Miss Teacher Bangs a\nBoy\").\n\nIt was featured prominently in advertisements for the film, _[Horton Hears a\nWho!](/wiki/Horton_Hears_a_Who!_\\(film\\) \"Horton Hears a Who! \\(film\\)\")_ ,\nand sung by the major characters near the end of the film as the titular\ncharacter celebrates his vindication and his charges' salvation.[9] In 2016,\nthe song was used in the UK and US on ads for [Sheba cat\nfood](/wiki/Sheba_\\(cat_food\\) \"Sheba \\(cat food\\)\").\n\n##\nPersonnel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Can%27t_Fight_This_Feeling&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Personnel\")]\n\n**REO Speedwagon**[10]\n\n  * [Kevin Cronin](/wiki/Kevin_Cronin \"Kevin Cronin\") \\- lead vocals\n  * [Gary Richrath](/wiki/Gary_Richrath \"Gary Richrath\") \\- guitar\n  * [Bruce Hall](/wiki/Bruce_Hall_\\(musician\\) \"Bruce Hall \\(musician\\)\") \\- bass, backing vocals\n  * [Neal Doughty](/wiki/Neal_Doughty \"Neal Doughty\") \\- keyboards\n  * [Alan Gratzer](/wiki/Alan_Gratzer \"Alan Gratzer\") \\- drums, backing vocals\n\n## Chart\nperformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Can%27t_Fight_This_Feeling&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Chart performance\")]\n\n### Weekly\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Can%27t_Fight_This_Feeling&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Weekly charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1984–85) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nAustralian [Kent Music Report](/wiki/Kent_Music_Report \"Kent Music Report\")[11] | 2  \nCanada ([_CHUM_](/wiki/CHUM_Chart \"CHUM Chart\"))[12] | 2  \nCanada Adult Contemporary ([RPM](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\"))[13] | 4  \nCanada ([_The Record_](/wiki/The_Record_\\(magazine\\) \"The Record \\(magazine\\)\"))[14] | 5  \n[Canadian _RPM_ Singles Chart](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\")[15] | 1  \nGermany [Media Control Charts](/wiki/Media_Control_Charts \"Media Control Charts\")[16] | 34  \n[Irish Singles Chart](/wiki/Irish_Singles_Chart \"Irish Singles Chart\")[17] | 5  \nRadio Luxemburg Singles[18] | 13  \n[New Zealand Singles Chart](/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_New_Zealand \"Recording Industry Association of New Zealand\")[19] | 33  \nPoland ([LP3](/wiki/Lista_Przeboj%C3%B3w_Programu_Trzeciego \"Lista Przebojów Programu Trzeciego\"))[20] | 21  \n[South African](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\") Singles Chart[21] | 8  \n[Swedish Singles Chart](/wiki/Sverigetopplistan \"Sverigetopplistan\")[22] | 15  \n[UK Singles Chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\")[23] | 16  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[24] | 1  \nUS [Adult Contemporary](/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_\\(chart\\) \"Adult Contemporary \\(chart\\)\")[25] | 3  \nUS [Top Rock Tracks](/wiki/Hot_Mainstream_Rock_Tracks \"Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks\")[25] | 5  \nUS [Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks](/wiki/Hot_R%26B/Hip-Hop_Singles_%26_Tracks \"Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks\")[25] | 89  \nUS [_Cash Box_](/wiki/Cashbox_\\(magazine\\) \"Cashbox \\(magazine\\)\") [26] | 1  \nUS _[Radio& Records (R&R)](/wiki/Radio_%26_Records \"Radio & Records\")_[27][28] | 1  \nChart (2011) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nUS [Rock Digital Songs](/wiki/Billboard_charts#Rock \"Billboard charts\")[29] | 32  \n  \n### Year-end\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Can%27t_Fight_This_Feeling&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Year-end charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1985) | Rank  \n---|---  \nAustralia ([Kent Music Report](/wiki/Kent_Music_Report \"Kent Music Report\"))[30] | 33  \nCanada ([_RPM_ Top 100 Singles](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\"))[31] | 33  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[32] | 13  \nUS [_Cash Box_](/wiki/Cashbox_\\(magazine\\) \"Cashbox \\(magazine\\)\") [33] | 10  \n  \n###\nCertifications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Can%27t_Fight_This_Feeling&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Certifications\")]\n\nRegion | Certification | [Certified units](/wiki/List_of_music_recording_certifications \"List of music recording certifications\")/Sales  \n---|---|---  \nCanada ([Music Canada](/wiki/Music_Canada \"Music Canada\"))[34] | Gold | 50,000^  \nUnited States ([RIAA](/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America \"Recording Industry Association of America\"))[35] | Gold | 500,000^  \n^shipments figures based on certification alone  \n  \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Can%27t_Fight_This_Feeling&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"VH1’s 40 Most Softsational Soft-Rock Songs\"](http://www.stereogum.com/5507/40_most_softsational_softrock_songs/franchises/list/). _[Stereogum](/wiki/Stereogum \"Stereogum\")_.
