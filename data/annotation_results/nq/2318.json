Camels have long been domesticated and, as\n[livestock](/wiki/Livestock \"Livestock\"), they provide food\n([milk](/wiki/Camel_milk \"Camel milk\") and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt\nfrom [hair](/wiki/Camel_hair \"Camel hair\")). As [working\nanimals](/wiki/Working_animal \"Working animal\"), camels—who are uniquely\nsuited to their desert habitats—are a vital means of transport for passengers\nand cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped\n[dromedary](/wiki/Dromedary \"Dromedary\") makes up 94% of the world's camel\npopulation, and the two-humped [Bactrian camel](/wiki/Bactrian_camel \"Bactrian\ncamel\") makes up the remainder. The [Wild Bactrian\ncamel](/wiki/Wild_Bactrian_camel \"Wild Bactrian camel\") is a separate species\nand is now critically endangered.\n\nThe word _camel_ is derived via [Latin](/wiki/Latin_language \"Latin\nlanguage\"): _camelus_ and [Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\"):\nκάμηλος (_kamēlos_) from Hebrew or Phoenician: _gāmāl_.[3][4] Used informally,\n\"camel\" (or, more correctly, \"camelid\") refers to any of the seven members of\nthe family Camelidae: the dromedary, the Bactrian, and the wild Bactrian (the\ntrue camels) plus the [llama](/wiki/Llama \"Llama\"), the [alpaca](/wiki/Alpaca\n\"Alpaca\"), the [guanaco](/wiki/Guanaco \"Guanaco\"), and the\n[vicuña](/wiki/Vicu%C3%B1a \"Vicuña\")[5] (the \"New World\" camelids).\n\nThe dromedary (_C. dromedarius_), also known as the _Arabian camel_ , inhabits\nthe [Middle East](/wiki/Middle_East \"Middle East\") and the [Horn of\nAfrica](/wiki/Horn_of_Africa \"Horn of Africa\"), while the Bactrian (_C.\nbactrianus_) inhabits [Central Asia](/wiki/Central_Asia \"Central Asia\"),\nincluding the historical region of [Bactria](/wiki/Bactria \"Bactria\"). The\ncritically endangered wild Bactrian (_C. ferus_) is found only in remote areas\nof [northwest China](/wiki/Northwest_China \"Northwest China\") and\n[Mongolia](/wiki/Mongolia \"Mongolia\").

It resembles a long,\nswollen, pink tongue hanging out of the side of its mouth.[13] Camels mate by\nhaving both male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from\nbehind.[14] The male usually [ejaculates](/wiki/Ejaculates \"Ejaculates\") three\nor four times within a single mating session.[15] Camelids are the only\nungulates to mate in a sitting position.[16]\n\n### Ecological and behavioral\nadaptations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Camel&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Ecological and behavioral adaptations\")]\n\nCamels do not directly store water in their humps as was once commonly\nbelieved. The humps are reservoirs of fatty tissue: concentrating [body\nfat](/wiki/Adipose_tissue \"Adipose tissue\") in their humps minimizes the\ninsulating effect fat would have if distributed over the rest of their bodies,\nhelping camels survive in hot climates.[17][18] When this tissue is\nmetabolized, it yields more than one gram of water for every gram of fat\nprocessed. This [fat metabolization](/wiki/Lipolysis \"Lipolysis\"), while\nreleasing energy, causes water to evaporate from the lungs during\n[respiration](/wiki/Breathing \"Breathing\") (as oxygen is required for the\nmetabolic process): overall, there is a net decrease in water.[19][20]\n\n[![A portrait of a camel with a visibly thick\nmane](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Camel_portrait.jpg/170px-\nCamel_portrait.jpg)](/wiki/File:Camel_portrait.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Camel_portrait.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA camel's thick coat is one of its many adaptations that aid it in desert-like\nconditions.\n\n[![A leashed pack\ncamel](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Eylcamel.jpg/220px-\nEylcamel.jpg)](/wiki/File:Eylcamel.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Eylcamel.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Somalia](/wiki/Wildlife_of_Somalia \"Wildlife of Somalia\") has the world's\nlargest population of camels.[21]\n\nCamels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand\nlong periods of time without any external source of water.[18] The dromedary\ncamel can drink as seldom as once every 10 days even under very hot\nconditions, and can lose up to 30% of its body mass due to dehydration.[22]\nUnlike other mammals, camels' [red blood cells](/wiki/Red_blood_cell \"Red\nblood cell\") are oval rather than circular in shape. This facilitates the flow\nof red blood cells during dehydration[23] and makes them better at\nwithstanding high [osmotic](/wiki/Osmosis \"Osmosis\") variation without\nrupturing when drinking large amounts of water: a 600 kg (1,300 lb) camel can\ndrink 200 L (53 US gal) of water in three minutes.[24][25]\n\nCamels are able to withstand changes in [body\ntemperature](/wiki/Body_temperature \"Body temperature\") and water consumption\nthat would kill most other animals. Their temperature ranges from 34 °C (93\n°F) at dawn and steadily increases to 40 °C (104 °F) by sunset, before they\ncool off at night again.[18] In general, to compare between camels and the\nother livestock, camels lose only 1.3 liters of fluid intake every day while\nthe other livestock lose 20 to 40 liters per day (Breulmann, et al., 2007)[26]\nMaintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for\nanimals; to assist this, camels have a [rete mirabile](/wiki/Rete_mirabile\n\"Rete mirabile\"), a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each\nother which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the\nbrain.[27] Camels rarely sweat, even when ambient temperatures reach 49 °C\n(120 °F).[8] Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather\nthan at the surface of their coat; the [heat of\nvaporization](/wiki/Heat_of_vaporization \"Heat of vaporization\") therefore\ncomes from body heat rather than ambient heat. Camels can withstand losing 25%\nof their body weight to sweating, whereas most other mammals can withstand\nonly about 12–14% dehydration before [cardiac\nfailure](/wiki/Congestive_heart_failure \"Congestive heart failure\") results\nfrom circulatory disturbance.[25]\n\nWhen the camel exhales, [water vapor](/wiki/Water_vapor \"Water vapor\") becomes\ntrapped in their [nostrils](/wiki/Nostrils \"Nostrils\") and is reabsorbed into\nthe body as a means to conserve water.[28] Camels eating green herbage can\ningest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies'\nhydrated state without the need for drinking.[29]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Camels_in_Dubai_2.jpg/220px-\nCamels_in_Dubai_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Camels_in_Dubai_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Camels_in_Dubai_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDomesticated camel calves lying in sternal recumbency, a position that aids\nheat loss\n\nThe camels' thick coats insulate them from the intense heat radiated from\ndesert sand; a shorn camel must sweat 50% more to avoid overheating.[30]\nDuring the summer the coat becomes lighter in color, reflecting light as well\nas helping avoid sunburn.[25] The camel's long legs help by keeping its body\nfarther from the ground, which can heat up to 70 °C (158 °F).[31][32]\nDromedaries have a pad of thick tissue over the [sternum](/wiki/Sternum\n\"Sternum\") called the _pedestal_. When the animal lies down in a sternal\nrecumbent position, the pedestal raises the body from the hot surface and\nallows cooling air to pass under the body.[27]\n\nCamels' mouths have a thick leathery lining, allowing them to chew thorny\ndesert plants. Long eyelashes and ear hairs, together with nostrils that can\nclose, form a barrier against sand. If sand gets lodged in their eyes, they\ncan dislodge it using their [transparent third\neyelid](/wiki/Nicitating_membrane \"Nicitating membrane\"). The camels' gait and\nwidened feet help them move without sinking into the sand.[31][33][34]\n\nThe [kidneys](/wiki/Kidney \"Kidney\") and [intestines](/wiki/Intestines\n\"Intestines\") of a camel are very efficient at reabsorbing water. Camels'\nkidneys have a 1:4 [cortex](/wiki/Renal_cortex \"Renal cortex\") to [medulla\nratio](/wiki/Renal_medulla \"Renal medulla\").[35] Thus medullary part of\ncamel's kidneys occupy twice as much area as a cow's kidney. Secondly, [renal\ncorpuscles](/wiki/Renal_corpuscles \"Renal corpuscles\") have a smaller\ndiameter, which reduces surface area for filtration. These two major\nanatomical characteristics enable camel to conserve water and limit the volume\nof urine in extreme desert conditions.[36] Camel urine comes out as a thick\nsyrup, and camel feces are so dry that they do not require drying when the\n[Bedouins](/wiki/Bedouins \"Bedouins\") use them to fuel fires.[37][38][39][40]\nThe camels are able to live in difficult conditions without drinking water due\nto their ability to produce small and dry droppings as well as they use the\nwater to maintain their body’s temperature to fit with the region surrounding\nthem (Breulmann, et al., 2007).[41]\n\nThe camel [immune system](/wiki/Immune_system \"Immune system\") differs from\nthose of other mammals. Normally, the Y-shaped [antibody](/wiki/Antibody\n\"Antibody\") molecules consist of two heavy (or long) chains along the length\nof the Y, and two light (or short) chains at each tip of the Y. Camels, in\naddition to these, also have antibodies made of only two heavy chains, a trait\nthat makes them smaller and more durable. These \"heavy-chain-only\" antibodies,\ndiscovered in 1993, are thought to have developed 50 million years ago, after\ncamelids split from ruminants and pigs.[42]\n\n### Genetics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Camel&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Genetics\")]\n\n[![Three camels in a line: a person rides on the leading\ncamel.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Camels_at_Giza.JPG/220px-\nCamels_at_Giza.JPG)](/wiki/File:Camels_at_Giza.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Camels_at_Giza.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nCaravan of dromedaries  \n_[Pyramids of Giza, Egypt](/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex \"Giza pyramid complex\")_\n\nThe [karyotypes](/wiki/Karyotype \"Karyotype\") of different camelid species\nhave been studied earlier by many groups,[43][44][45][46][47][48] but no\nagreement on chromosome nomenclature of camelids has been reached. A 2007\nstudy [flow sorted](/wiki/Flow_sorting \"Flow sorting\") camel chromosomes,\nbuilding on the fact that camels have 37 pairs of chromosomes (2n=74), and\nfound that the karyotime consisted of one\n[metacentric](/wiki/Centromere#Metacentric \"Centromere\"), three\nsubmetacentric, and 32 acrocentric autosomes. The [Y](/wiki/Y_chromosome \"Y\nchromosome\") is a small metacentric chromosome, while the\n[X](/wiki/X_chromosome \"X chromosome\") is a large metacentric chromosome.[49]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Camel_skull.jpg/220px-\nCamel_skull.jpg)](/wiki/File:Camel_skull.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Camel_skull.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSkull of an F1 hybrid camel  \n_[Museum of Osteology](/wiki/Museum_of_Osteology \"Museum of Osteology\"),\nOklahoma_\n\nThe [hybrid camel](/wiki/Hybrid_camel \"Hybrid camel\"), a hybrid between\nBactrian and dromedary camels, has one hump, though it has an indentation 4–12\ncm (1.6–4.7 in) deep that divides the front from the back. The hybrid is 2.15\nm (7 ft 1 in) at the shoulder and 2.32 m (7 ft 7 in) tall at the hump. It\nweighs an average of 650 kg (1,430 lb) and can carry around 400 to 450 kg (880\nto 990 lb), which is more than either the dromedary or Bactrian can.[50]\n\nAccording to molecular data, the New World and Old World camelids diverged\nabout 11 million years ago.[51] In spite of this, these species can hybridize\nand produce viable offspring.[52] The [cama](/wiki/Cama_\\(animal\\) \"Cama\n\\(animal\\)\") is a camel-lama hybrid bred by scientists to see how closely\nrelated the parent species are.[53] Scientists [collected\nsemen](/wiki/Collected_semen \"Collected semen\") from a camel via an artificial\nvagina and inseminated a llama after stimulating ovulation with\n[gonadotrophin](/wiki/Gonadotrophin \"Gonadotrophin\") injections.[54] The cama\nis halfway in size between a camel and a llama and lacks a hump. It has ears\nintermediate between those of camels and llamas, longer legs than the llama,\nand partially [cloven hooves](/wiki/Cloven-hoof \"Cloven-hoof\").[55][56] Like\nthe [mule](/wiki/Mule

(during the\n[Eocene](/wiki/Eocene \"Eocene\")).[15] It was about the size of a rabbit and\nlived in the open woodlands of what is now [South Dakota](/wiki/South_Dakota\n\"South Dakota\").[59][60] By 35 million years ago, the\n_[Poebrotherium](/wiki/Poebrotherium \"Poebrotherium\")_ was the size of a goat\nand had many more traits similar to camels and llamas.[61][62] The hoofed\n_[Stenomylus](/wiki/Stenomylus \"Stenomylus\")_ , which walked on the tips of\nits toes, also existed around this time, and the long-necked\n_[Aepycamelus](/wiki/Aepycamelus \"Aepycamelus\")_ evolved in the\n[Miocene](/wiki/Miocene \"Miocene\").[63]\n\nThe direct ancestor of all modern camels, _[Procamelus](/wiki/Procamelus\n\"Procamelus\")_ , existed in the upper Miocene and lower Pliocene.[64] Around\n3–5 million years ago, the North American Camelidae spread to South America as\npart of the [Great American Interchange](/wiki/Great_American_Interchange\n\"Great American

their extinction in their native land, camels spread\nacross the Bering land bridge, moving the opposite direction from the Asian\nimmigration to America, to survive in the Old World and eventually be\ndomesticated and spread globally by humans. Most camels surviving today are\ndomesticated.[40][70] Along with many other megafauna in North America, the\noriginal wild camels were wiped out during the spread of [Native\nAmericans](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas \"Indigenous peoples of the\nAmericas\") from Asia into North America, 12,000 to 10,000 years ago.[68][69]\nAlthough feral populations exist in Australia, India and Kazakhstan, the only\nwild camels left are the [wild Bactrian camels](/wiki/Wild_Bactrian_camel\n\"Wild Bactrian camel\") of the [Gobi Desert](/wiki/Gobi_Desert \"Gobi\nDesert\").[9]\n\nDromedaries may have first been domesticated by humans in Somalia and southern\nArabia, around 3,000 BC, the Bactrian in [central Asia](/wiki/Central_Asia\n\"Central Asia\") around 2,500 BC,[15][71][72][73] as at Shar-i Sokhta (also\nknown as the Burnt City), [Iran](/wiki/Iran \"Iran\").[74]\n\nDiscussions concerning camel domestication in [Mesopotamia](/wiki/Mesopotamia\n\"Mesopotamia\") are often related to mentions of camels in the [Hebrew\nBible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible \"Hebrew Bible\"). The _International Standard Bible\nEncyclopedia: E-J_ for instance mentions that \"In accord with patriarchal\ntraditions, cylinder seals from Middle Bronze Age Mesopotamia showed riders\nseated upon camels.\"[75][76]\n\nMartin Heide's 2010 work on the domestication of the camel tentatively\nconcludes that the bactrian camel was domesticated by at least the middle of\nthe third millennium somewhere east of the [Zagros\nMountains](/wiki/Zagros_Mountains \"Zagros Mountains\"), then moving into\nMesopotamia, and suggests that mentions of camels \"in the patriarchal\nnarratives may refer, at least in some places, to the Bactrian camel.\" while\nnoting that the camel is not mentioned in relationship to\n[Canaan](/wiki/Canaan \"Canaan\").[77]\n\nRecent excavations in the [Timna Valley](/wiki/Timna_Valley \"Timna Valley\") by\nLidar Sapir-Hen and Erez Ben-Yosef discovered what may be the earliest\ndomestic camel bones found in Israel or even outside the [Arabian\nPeninsula](/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula \"Arabian Peninsula\"), dating to around 930\nBC. This garnered considerable media coverage as it was described as evidence\nthat the stories of [Abraham](/wiki/Abraham \"Abraham\"), [Jacob](/wiki/Jacob\n\"Jacob\"), [Esau](/wiki/Esau \"Esau\"), and [Joseph](/wiki/Joseph_\\(Genesis\\)\n\"Joseph \\(Genesis\\)\") were written after this time.[78][79]\n\nThe existence of camels in Mesopotamia but not in Israel is not a new idea.\nThe historian [Richard Bulliet](/wiki/Richard_Bulliet \"Richard Bulliet\") did\nnot think that the occasional mention of camels meant that the domestic camels\nwere common in the Holy Land at that time.[80] The archaeologist [William F.\nAlbright](/wiki/William_F._Albright \"William F. Albright\") writing even\nearlier saw camels in the Bible as an [anachronism](/wiki/Anachronism\n\"Anachronism\").[81]\n\nThe official report by Sapir-Hen and Ben-Joseph notes that \"The introduction\nof the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) as a pack animal to the [southern\nLevant](/wiki/Southern_Levant \"Southern Levant\") ... substantially facilitated\ntrade across the vast deserts of Arabia, promoting both economic and social\nchange (e.g., Kohler 1984; Borowski 1998: 112–116; Jasmin 2005). This ... has\ngenerated extensive discussion regarding the date of the earliest domestic\ncamel in the southern Levant (and beyond) (e.g., Albright 1949: 207; Epstein\n1971: 558–584; Bulliet 1975; Zarins 1989; Köhler-Rollefson 1993; Uerpmann and\nUerpmann 2002; Jasmin 2005; 2006; Heide 2010; Rosen and Saidel 2010; Grigson\n2012). Most scholars today agree that the dromedary was exploited as a pack\nanimal sometime in the early [Iron Age](/wiki/Iron_Age \"Iron Age\") (not before\nthe 12th century [BC])\" and concludes that \"Current data from copper smelting\nsites of the [Aravah Valley](/wiki/Arabah \"Arabah\") enable us to pinpoint the\nintroduction of domestic camels to the southern Levant more precisely based on\nstratigraphic contexts associated with an extensive suite of [radiocarbon\ndates](/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating \"Radiocarbon dating\"). The data indicate that\nthis event occurred not earlier than the last third of the 10th century [BC]\nand most probably during this time. The coincidence of this event with a major\nreorganization of the copper industry of the region—attributed to the results\nof the campaign of Pharaoh [Shoshenq I](/wiki/Shoshenq_I \"Shoshenq I\")—raises\nthe possibility that the two were connected, and that camels were introduced\nas part of the efforts to improve efficiency by facilitating trade.\"[79]\n\n### Textiles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Camel&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Textiles\")]\n\nMain article: [Camel hair](/wiki/Camel_hair \"Camel hair\")\n\nDesert tribes and Mongolian nomads use camel hair for tents,\n[yurts](/wiki/Yurt \"Yurt\"), clothing, bedding and accessories. Camels have\nouter guard hairs and soft inner down, and the fibers are sorted by color and\nage of the animal. The guard hairs can be felted for use as waterproof coats\nfor the herdsmen, while the softer hair is used for premium goods.[82] The\nfiber can be spun for use in weaving or made into yarns for hand knitting or\ncrochet.

The carcass of a\nfemale dromedary weighs less than the male, ranging between 250 and 350 kg\n(550 and 770 lb).[15] The brisket, ribs and loin are among the preferred\nparts, and the hump is considered a delicacy.[118] The hump contains \"white\nand sickly fat\", which can be used to make the _khli_ (preserved meat) of\nmutton, beef, or camel.[119] On the other hand, camel milk and meat are rich\nin protein, vitamins, glycogen, and other nutrients making them essential in\nthe diet of many people. From chemical composition to meat quality, the\ndromedary camel is the preferred breed for meat production. It does well even\nin arid areas due to its unusual physiological behaviors and characteristics,\nwhich include tolerance to extreme temperatures, radiation from the sun, water\npaucity, rugged landscape and low vegetation (Aleme, 2013).[120] Camel meat is\nreported to taste like coarse beef, but older camels can prove to be very\ntough,[10][15] although camel meat becomes more tender the more it is\ncooked.[121] The [Abu Dhabi](/wiki/Abu_Dhabi \"Abu Dhabi\") Officers' Club\nserves a camel burger mixed with beef or lamb fat in order to improve the\ntexture and taste.[122] In [Karachi, Pakistan](/wiki/Karachi,_Pakistan\n\"Karachi, Pakistan\"), some restaurants prepare [nihari](/wiki/Nihari \"Nihari\")\nfrom camel meat.[123] In [Syria](/wiki/Syria \"Syria\") and [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt\n\"Egypt\"), there are specialist camel butchers.[124]\n\nCamel meat has been eaten for centuries.

These he commanded to advance in front of his other troops against the Lydian horse; behind them were to follow the foot soldiers, and last of all the cavalry. When his arrangements were complete, he gave his troops orders to slay all the other Lydians who came in their way without mercy, but to spare Croesus and not kill him, even if he should be seized and offer resistance. The reason why Cyrus opposed his camels to the enemy's horse was because the horse has a natural dread of the camel, and cannot abide either the sight or the smell of that animal. By this stratagem he hoped to make Croesus's horse useless to him, the horse being what he chiefly depended on for victory. The two armies then joined battle, and immediately the Lydian war-horses, seeing and smelling the camels, turned round and galloped off; and so it came to pass that all Croesus's hopes withered away.\"\n  93. **Jump up ^** [\"Cameliers and camels at war\"](http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/camel-corps). _New Zealand History online_.
