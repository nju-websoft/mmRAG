Established by the [Northern Ireland Act\n1998](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Act_1998 \"Northern Ireland Act 1998\") as part of\nthe [Good Friday Agreement](/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement \"Good Friday\nAgreement\"), the [Northern Ireland Assembly](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly\n\"Northern Ireland Assembly\") holds responsibility for a range of devolved\npolicy matters, while other areas are reserved for the [British\ngovernment](/wiki/British_government \"British government\"). Northern Ireland\nco-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement\ngranted the Republic the ability to \"put forward views and proposals\" with\n\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\".[14]\n\nNorthern Ireland was created in 1921, when [Ireland was\npartitioned](/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland \"Partition of Ireland\") between\nNorthern Ireland and [Southern\nIreland](/wiki/Southern_Ireland_\\(1921%E2%80%9322\\) \"Southern Ireland\n\\(1921–22\\)\") by the [Government of Ireland Act\n1920](/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920 \"Government of Ireland Act 1920\").\nUnlike Southern Ireland, which would become the [Irish Free\nState](/wiki/Irish_Free_State \"Irish Free State\") in 1922, the majority of\nNorthern Ireland's population were [unionists](/wiki/Unionism_in_Ireland\n\"Unionism in Ireland\"), who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom.[15]\nMost of these were the [Protestant](/wiki/Ulster_Protestants \"Ulster\nProtestants\") descendants of [colonists from Great\nBritain](/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster \"Plantation of Ulster\"). However, a\nsignificant minority, mostly [Catholics](/wiki/Irish_Catholic \"Irish\nCatholic\"), were [nationalists](/wiki/Irish_nationalism \"Irish nationalism\")\nwho wanted a [united Ireland](/wiki/United_Ireland \"United Ireland\")\nindependent of British rule.[16][17][18][19] Today, the former generally see\nthemselves as British and the latter generally see themselves as Irish, while\na distinct Northern Irish or [Ulster](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\") identity is\nclaimed both by a large minority of [Catholics](/wiki/Catholic_Church\n\"Catholic Church\") and [Protestants](/wiki/Protestantism \"Protestantism\") and\nby many of those who are non-aligned.[20]\n\nFor most of the 20th century, when it came into existence, Northern Ireland\nwas marked by discrimination and hostility between these two sides in what\n[First Minister of Northern Ireland](/wiki/First_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland\n\"First Minister of Northern Ireland\") [David Trimble](/wiki/David_Trimble\n\"David Trimble\") called a \"cold house\" for Catholics. In the late 1960s,\nconflict between state forces and chiefly Protestant unionists on the one\nhand, and chiefly Catholic nationalists on the other, erupted into three\ndecades of violence known as [the Troubles](/wiki/The_Troubles \"The\nTroubles\"), which claimed over 3,500 lives and caused over 50,000\ncasualties.[21][22] The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the\n[peace process](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process \"Northern Ireland peace\nprocess\"), including the [decommissioning of\nweapons](/wiki/Decommissioning_of_weapons \"Decommissioning of weapons\"),\nalthough [sectarianism](/wiki/Sectarianism \"Sectarianism\") and religious\nsegregation still remain major social problems, and sporadic violence has\ncontinued.[23]\n\nNorthern Ireland has historically been the most industrialised region of\nIreland. After declining as a result of the political and social turmoil of\nthe Troubles,[24] [its economy](/wiki/Economy_of_Northern_Ireland \"Economy of\nNorthern Ireland\") has grown significantly since the late 1990s. The initial\ngrowth came from the \"[peace dividend](/wiki/Peace_Dividend#Other_uses \"Peace\nDividend\")\" and the links which increased trade with the Republic of Ireland,\ncontinuing with a significant increase in tourism, investment and business\nfrom around the world. Unemployment in Northern Ireland peaked at 17.2% in\n1986, dropping to 6.1% for June–August\n2014[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Northern_Ireland&action=edit)\nand down by 1.2 percentage points over the year,[25] similar to the UK figure\nof 6.2%.[26] 58.2% of those unemployed had been unemployed for over a year.\n\nProminent [artists and sportspeople](/wiki/Culture_of_Northern_Ireland\n\"Culture of Northern Ireland\") from Northern Ireland include [Van\nMorrison](/wiki/Van_Morrison \"Van Morrison\"), [Rory\nMcIlroy](/wiki/Rory_McIlroy \"Rory McIlroy\"), [Joey Dunlop](/wiki/Joey_Dunlop\n\"Joey Dunlop\"), [Wayne McCullough](/wiki/Wayne_McCullough \"Wayne McCullough\")\nand [George Best](/wiki/George_Best \"George Best\"). Some people from Northern\nIreland prefer to identify as Irish (e.g., poet [Seamus\nHeaney](/wiki/Seamus_Heaney \"Seamus Heaney\") and actor [Liam\nNeeson](/wiki/Liam_Neeson \"Liam Neeson\")) while others prefer to identify as\nBritish (e.g. actor [Kenneth Branagh](/wiki/Kenneth_Branagh \"Kenneth\nBranagh\")). Cultural links between Northern Ireland, the rest of Ireland, and\nthe rest of the UK are complex, with Northern Ireland sharing both the\n[culture of Ireland](/wiki/Culture_of_Ireland \"Culture of Ireland\") and the\n[culture of the United Kingdom](/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Culture\nof the United Kingdom\"). In many sports, the island of Ireland fields a single\nteam, a notable exception being association football. Northern Ireland\n[competes separately](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_at_the_Commonwealth_Games\n\"Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games\") at the [Commonwealth\nGames](/wiki/Commonwealth_Games \"Commonwealth Games\"), and people from\nNorthern Ireland may compete for either [Great\nBritain](/wiki/Great_Britain_at_the_Olympics \"Great Britain at the Olympics\")\nor [Ireland](/wiki/Ireland_at_the_Olympics \"Ireland at the Olympics\") at the\n[Olympic Games](/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Partition of Ireland\n    * 1.2 Northern Ireland\n      * 1.2.1 The Troubles\n      * 1.2.2 Peace process\n  * 2 Politics\n    * 2.1 Background\n    * 2.2 Governance\n    * 2.3 Descriptions\n    * 2.4 Alternative names\n      * 2.4.1 Unionist\n      * 2.4.2 Nationalist\n      * 2.4.3 Other\n  * 3 Geography and climate\n    * 3.1 Counties\n  * 4 Economy\n  * 5 Transportation\n  * 6 Demographics\n    * 6.1 Religion\n    * 6.2 Citizenship and identity\n    * 6.3 Languages\n      * 6.3.1 English\n      * 6.3.2 Irish\n      * 6.3.3 Ulster Scots\n      * 6.3.4 Sign languages\n  * 7 Culture\n    * 7.1 Symbols\n  * 8 Sport\n    * 8.1 Field sports\n      * 8.1.1 Association football\n      * 8.1.2 Rugby union\n      * 8.1.3 Cricket\n      * 8.1.4 Gaelic games\n    * 8.2 Golf\n    * 8.3 Snooker\n    * 8.4 Motor sports\n    * 8.5 Rugby league\n    * 8.6 Professional wrestling\n  * 9 Education\n  * 10 Wildlife\n  * 11 Media and communications\n  * 12 See also\n  * 13 References\n  * 14 Further reading\n  * 15 External links\n\n## History\n\nSee also: [History of Ireland](/wiki/History_of_Ireland \"History of Ireland\")\nand [Ulster § History](/wiki/Ulster#History \"Ulster\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Cannon_on_Derry_City_Walls_SMC_2007.jpg/220px-\nCannon_on_Derry_City_Walls_SMC_2007.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cannon_on_Derry_City_Walls_SMC_2007.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cannon_on_Derry_City_Walls_SMC_2007.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCannon on [Derry](/wiki/Derry \"Derry\")'s [city walls](/wiki/Derry#City_walls\n\"Derry\")\n\nThe region that is now Northern Ireland was the bedrock of the [Irish war of\nresistance](/wiki/Nine_Years%27_War_\\(Ireland\\) \"Nine Years' War \\(Ireland\\)\")\nagainst [English](/wiki/Kingdom_of_England \"Kingdom of England\") [programmes\nof colonialism](/wiki/Plantations_of_Ireland \"Plantations of Ireland\") in the\nlate 16th century. The English-controlled [Kingdom of\nIreland](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland \"Kingdom of Ireland\") had been declared by\nthe English king [Henry VIII](/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England \"Henry VIII of\nEngland\") in 1542, but Irish resistance made English control fragmentary.\nFollowing Irish defeat at the [Battle of Kinsale](/wiki/Battle_of_Kinsale\n\"Battle of Kinsale\"), though, the region's [Gaelic](/wiki/Gaels \"Gaels\"),\nRoman Catholic [aristocracy](/wiki/Aristocracy \"Aristocracy\") [fled to\ncontinental Europe](/wiki/Flight_of_the_Earls \"Flight of the Earls\") in 1607\nand the region became subject to major programmes of colonialism by Protestant\nEnglish (mainly [Anglican](/wiki/Anglican \"Anglican\")) and Scottish (mainly\n[Presbyterian](/wiki/Presbyterianism \"Presbyterianism\")) settlers. [A\nrebellion in 1641](/wiki/Irish_Rebellion_of_1641 \"Irish Rebellion of 1641\") by\nIrish aristocrats against English rule resulted in a massacre of settlers in\nUlster in the context of a [war breaking out between England, Scotland and\nIreland](/wiki/Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms \"Wars of the Three Kingdoms\")\nfuelled by religious intolerance in government. Victories by English forces in\nthat war and further Protestant victories in the [Williamite War in\nIreland](/wiki/Williamite_War_in_Ireland \"Williamite War in Ireland\") toward\nthe close of the 17th century solidified [Anglican](/wiki/Church_of_Ireland\n\"Church of Ireland\") rule in Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the victories of\nthe [Siege of Derry](/wiki/Siege_of_Derry \"Siege of Derry\") (1689) and the\n[Battle of the Boyne](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Boyne \"Battle of the Boyne\") (1690)\nin this latter war are still celebrated by some Protestants (both Anglican and\nPresbyterian).[27][28]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/CIMG1495_ScraboHorizView.JPG/220px-\nCIMG1495_ScraboHorizView.JPG)](/wiki/File:CIMG1495_ScraboHorizView.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CIMG1495_ScraboHorizView.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Scrabo Tower](/wiki/Scrabo_Tower \"Scrabo Tower\"), [County\nDown](/wiki/County_Down \"County Down\")\n\nFollowing the victory of 1691, and contrary to the terms of the [Treaty of\nLimerick](/wiki/Treaty_of_Limerick \"Treaty of Limerick\"), after the Pope who\nhad been allied to William of Orange recognised James II as continuing king of\nGreat Britain and Ireland in place of William, a series of [penal\nlaws](/wiki/Penal_laws \"Penal laws\") was passed by the [Anglican ruling\nclass](/wiki/Protestant_Ascendancy \"Protestant Ascendancy\") in Ireland. Their\nintention was to materially disadvantage the Catholic community and, to a\nlesser extent, the Presbyterian community. In the context of open\ninstitutional discrimination, the 18th century saw [secret, militant\nsocieties](/wiki/Secret_societies \"Secret societies\") develop in communities\nin the region and act on [sectarian](/wiki/Sectarianism \"Sectarianism\")\ntensions in violent attacks. These events escalated at the end of the century\nfollowing an event known as the [Battle of the\nDiamond](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Diamond \"Battle of the Diamond\"), which saw the\nsupremacy of the Anglican and Presbyterian [Peep o'Day\nBoys](/wiki/Peep_o%27Day_Boys \"Peep o'Day Boys\") over the Catholic\n[Defenders](/wiki/Defenders_\\(Ireland\\) \"Defenders \\(Ireland\\)\") and leading\nto the formation of the Anglican [Orange Order](/wiki/Orange_Order \"Orange\nOrder\"). [A rebellion in 1798](/wiki/1798_Rebellion \"1798 Rebellion\") led by\nthe cross-community Belfast-based [Society of the United\nIrishmen](/wiki/Society_of_the_United_Irishmen \"Society of the United\nIrishmen\") and inspired by the [French Revolution](/wiki/French_Revolution\n\"French Revolution\") sought to break the constitutional ties between Ireland\nand Britain and unite Irish people of all religions. Following this, in an\nattempt to quell sectarianism and force the removal of discriminatory laws\n(and to prevent the spread of French-style republicanism to Ireland), the\ngovernment of the [Kingdom of Great Britain](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain\n\"Kingdom of Great Britain\") pushed for the two kingdoms to be merged. The new\nstate, formed in 1801, the [United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nIreland](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Ireland\"), was governed from a single government and\nparliament based in London.\n\nBetween 1717 and 1775 some 250,000 people from Ulster emigrated to the British\nNorth American colonies.[29] It is estimated that there are more than 27\nmillion [Scotch-Irish Americans](/wiki/Scotch-Irish_American \"Scotch-Irish\nAmerican\") now living in the US.[30]\n\n### Partition of Ireland\n\nMain article: [Partition of Ireland](/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland \"Partition of\nIreland\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Carson_signing_Solemn_League_and_Covenant.jpg/220px-\nCarson_signing_Solemn_League_and_Covenant.jpg)](/wiki/File:Carson_signing_Solemn_League_and_Covenant.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Carson_signing_Solemn_League_and_Covenant.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSigning of the [Ulster Covenant](/wiki/Ulster_Covenant \"Ulster Covenant\") in\n1912 in opposition to Home Rule\n\nDuring the 19th century, [legal reforms](/wiki/Catholic_Emancipation \"Catholic\nEmancipation\") started in the late 18th century continued to remove statutory\ndiscrimination against Catholics, and progressive programmes enabled tenant\nfarmers to buy land from landlords. By the close of the century, autonomy for\nIreland within the United Kingdom, known as _[Home\nRule](/wiki/Irish_Home_Rule_movement \"Irish Home Rule movement\")_ , was\nregarded as highly likely. In 1912, after decades of obstruction from the\n[House of Lords](/wiki/House_of_Lords \"House of Lords\"), Home Rule became a\nnear-certainty. A clash between the [House of\nCommons](/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom \"House of Commons of the\nUnited Kingdom\") and House of Lords over a controversial budget produced the\n[Parliament Act 1911](/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911 \"Parliament Act 1911\"), which\nenabled the veto of the Lords to be overturned. The House of Lords veto had\nbeen the unionists' main guarantee that Home Rule would not be enacted,\nbecause the majority of members of the House of Lords were unionists. In\nresponse, opponents to Home Rule, from [Conservative and Unionist\nParty](/wiki/Conservative_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Conservative Party \\(UK\\)\") leaders\nsuch as [Bonar Law](/wiki/Bonar_Law \"Bonar Law\") and Dublin-based\n[barrister](/wiki/Barrister \"Barrister\") [Sir Edward\nCarson](/wiki/Edward_Carson \"Edward Carson\") to militant working class\nunionists in Ireland, threatened the use of violence. In 1914, [they smuggled\nthousands of rifles and rounds of ammunition](/wiki/Larne_Gun_Running \"Larne\nGun Running\") from [Imperial Germany](/wiki/German_Empire \"German Empire\") for\nuse by the [Ulster Volunteers](/wiki/Ulster_Volunteers \"Ulster Volunteers\")\n(UVF), a paramilitary organisation opposed to the implementation of Home Rule.\n\nUnionists were in a minority in Ireland as a whole, but in the northern\nprovince of [Ulster](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\") they were a very large majority in\n[County Antrim](/wiki/County_Antrim \"County Antrim\") and [County\nDown](/wiki/County_Down \"County Down\"), small majorities in [County\nArmagh](/wiki/County_Armagh \"County Armagh\") and [County\nLondonderry](/wiki/County_Londonderry \"County Londonderry\") and a substantial\nminority in the rest of the province.[31] These four counties, as well as\n[County Fermanagh](/wiki/County_Fermanagh \"County Fermanagh\") and [County\nTyrone](/wiki/County_Tyrone \"County Tyrone\"), would later constitute Northern\nIreland. Most of the remaining 26 counties which later became the Republic of\nIreland were overwhelmingly majority-nationalist.\n\nDuring the [Home Rule Crisis](/wiki/Home_Rule_Crisis \"Home Rule Crisis\") the\npossibility was discussed of a \"temporary\" partition of these six counties\nfrom the rest of Ireland. In 1914, the _[Third Home Rule\nBill](/wiki/Third_Home_Rule_Bill \"Third Home Rule Bill\")_ received [Royal\nAssent](/wiki/Royal_Assent \"Royal Assent\") as the [Government of Ireland Act\n1914](/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1914 \"Government of Ireland Act 1914\").\nHowever, its implementation was suspended before it came into effect because\nof the outbreak of the [First World War](/wiki/WW_I \"WW I\"), and the Amending\nBill to partition Ireland was abandoned. The war was expected to last only a\nfew weeks but in fact lasted four years. By the end of the war (during which\nthe 1916 [Easter Rising](/wiki/Easter_Rising \"Easter Rising\") had taken\nplace), the Act was seen as unimplementable. Public opinion among nationalists\nhad shifted during the war from a demand for home rule to one for full\nindependence. In 1919, [David Lloyd George](/wiki/David_Lloyd_George \"David\nLloyd George\") proposed a new bill be established by the cabinet's _[Walter\nLong](/wiki/Walter_Long,_1st_Viscount_Long#Political_career.2C_1911.E2.80.931921\n\"Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long\") Committee_ on Ireland, which by adopting\nfindings of his (Lloyd George's) inconclusive 1917-18 [Irish\nConvention](/wiki/Irish_Convention#Home_Rule_after-life \"Irish Convention\")\nwould divide Ireland into two Home Rule areas: twenty-six counties being ruled\nfrom [Dublin](/wiki/Dublin \"Dublin\") and six being ruled from\n[Belfast](/wiki/Belfast \"Belfast\"). Straddling these two areas would be a\nshared [Lord Lieutenant of Ireland](/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland \"Lord\nLieutenant of Ireland\") who would appoint both governments and a [Council of\nIreland](/wiki/Council_of_Ireland \"Council of Ireland\"), which Lloyd George\nbelieved would evolve into an all-Ireland parliament.[32]\n\nEvents overtook the government. In the [general election of\n1918](/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1918 \"United Kingdom general\nelection, 1918\"), the pro-independence [Sinn Féin](/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in \"Sinn\nFéin\") won 73 of the 105 parliamentary seats in Ireland and unilaterally\nestablished the [First Dáil](/wiki/First_D%C3%A1il \"First Dáil\"), an\nextrajudicial parliament in Ireland. [Ireland was\npartitioned](/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland \"Partition of Ireland\") between\nNorthern Ireland and [Southern\nIreland](/wiki/Southern_Ireland_\\(1921%E2%80%9322\\) \"Southern Ireland\n\\(1921–22\\)\") in 1921 under the terms of Lloyd George's [Government of Ireland\nAct 1920](/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920 \"Government of Ireland Act\n1920\")[33] during the [Anglo-Irish War](/wiki/Anglo-Irish_War \"Anglo-Irish\nWar\") between Irish republican and British forces. The war ended on 6 December\n1921, with the signing of the [Anglo-Irish Treaty](/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty\n\"Anglo-Irish Treaty\"), which created the [Irish Free\nState](/wiki/Irish_Free_State \"Irish Free State\"). Under the terms of the\ntreaty, Northern Ireland would become part of the Free State unless the\ngovernment opted out by presenting an address to the king, although in\npractice partition remained in place.[34]\n\n### Northern Ireland\n\nMain article: [History of Northern Ireland](/wiki/History_of_Northern_Ireland\n\"History of Northern Ireland\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Coat_of_Arms_of_Northern_Ireland.svg/220px-\nCoat_of_Arms_of_Northern_Ireland.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_Northern_Ireland.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_Northern_Ireland.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Coat of Arms of Northern Ireland](/wiki/Coat_of_Arms_of_Northern_Ireland\n\"Coat of Arms of Northern Ireland\") used between 1924 and 1973\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Opening_of_the_new_Northern_Ireland_Parliament_Buildings.jpg/220px-\nOpening_of_the_new_Northern_Ireland_Parliament_Buildings.jpg)](/wiki/File:Opening_of_the_new_Northern_Ireland_Parliament_Buildings.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Opening_of_the_new_Northern_Ireland_Parliament_Buildings.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nOpening of [Stormont](/wiki/Parliament_Buildings_\\(Northern_Ireland\\)\n\"Parliament Buildings \\(Northern Ireland\\)\") in 1932\n\nAs expected, the Houses of the [Parliament of Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland \"Parliament of Northern\nIreland\") resolved on 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the\nIrish Free State) to exercise its right to opt out of the Free State by making\nan address to the [King](/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom \"George V of the\nUnited Kingdom\").[35] The text of the address was:\n\n> Most Gracious Sovereign, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,\n> the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having\n> learnt of the passing of the [Irish Free State Constitution Act\n> 1922](/wiki/Irish_Free_State_Constitution_Act_1922 \"Irish Free State\n> Constitution Act 1922\"), being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of\n> the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland,\n> do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the\n> Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to\n> Northern Ireland.[36][37]\n\nShortly afterwards, the [Boundary Commission](/wiki/Irish_Boundary_Commission\n\"Irish Boundary Commission\") was established to decide on the territorial\nboundaries between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Owing to the\noutbreak of [civil war in the Free State](/wiki/Irish_Civil_War \"Irish Civil\nWar\"), the work of the commission was delayed until 1925. Leaders in Dublin\nexpected a substantial reduction in the territory of Northern Ireland, with\nnationalist areas moving to the Free State. However the commission's report\nrecommended only that some small portions of land should be ceded from\nNorthern Ireland to the Free State and even that a small amount of land should\nbe ceded from the Free State to Northern Ireland. To prevent argument, this\nreport was suppressed and, in exchange for a waiver to the Free State's\nobligations to the UK's public debt and the dissolution of the Council of\nIreland (sought by the [Government of Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Government_of_Northern_Ireland \"Government of Northern\nIreland\")), the initial six-county border was maintained with no changes.\n\nIn June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the\n[Allies](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II \"Allies of World War II\"), British Prime\nMinister [Winston Churchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill \"Winston Churchill\")\nindicated to the [Taoiseach](/wiki/Taoiseach \"Taoiseach\") [Éamon de\nValera](/wiki/%C3%89amon_de_Valera \"Éamon de Valera\") that the United Kingdom\nwould push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de\nValera declined the offer.[38] The British did not inform the Government of\nNorthern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Dublin government, and De\nValera's rejection was not publicised until 1970.\n\nThe [Ireland Act 1949](/wiki/Ireland_Act_1949 \"Ireland Act 1949\") gave the\nfirst legal guarantee that the region would not cease to be part of the United\nKingdom without the consent of the [Parliament of Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland \"Parliament of Northern\nIreland\").\n\n#### The Troubles\n\nMain article: [The Troubles](/wiki/The_Troubles \"The Troubles\")\n\nThe Troubles, which started in the late 1960s, consisted of about thirty years\nof recurring acts of intense violence during which 3,254 people were\nkilled[39] with over 50,000 casualties.[40] From 1969 to 2003 there were over\n36,900 shooting incidents and over 16,200 bombings or attempted bombings\nassociated with The Troubles.[41] The conflict was caused by the disputed\nstatus of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom and the discrimination\nagainst the [Irish nationalist](/wiki/Irish_nationalist \"Irish nationalist\")\nminority by the dominant [unionist](/wiki/Unionism_in_Ireland \"Unionism in\nIreland\") majority.[42] From 1967 to 1972 the [Northern Ireland Civil Rights\nAssociation](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association \"Northern Ireland\nCivil Rights Association\") (NICRA), which modelled itself on the US civil\nrights movement, led a campaign of [civil resistance](/wiki/Civil_resistance\n\"Civil resistance\") to anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment,\npolicing, and electoral procedures. The franchise for local government\nelections included only rate-payers and their spouses, and so excluded over a\nquarter of the electorate. While the majority of disenfranchised electors were\nProtestant, but Catholics were over-represented since they were poorer and had\nmore adults still living in the family home.[43]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Troubles_deaths_by_perpetrator.png/440px-\nTroubles_deaths_by_perpetrator.png)](/wiki/File:Troubles_deaths_by_perpetrator.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Troubles_deaths_by_perpetrator.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nResponsibility for Troubles-related deaths between 1969 and 2001\n\nNICRA's campaign, seen by many unionists as an [Irish\nrepublican](/wiki/Irish_republican \"Irish republican\") front, and the violent\nreaction to it, proved to be a precursor to a more violent period.[44] As\nearly as 1969, armed campaigns of paramilitary groups began, including the\n[Provisional IRA campaign of\n1969–1997](/wiki/Provisional_IRA_campaign_1969-1997 \"Provisional IRA campaign\n1969-1997\") which was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland and\nthe creation of a [United Ireland](/wiki/United_Ireland \"United Ireland\"), and\nthe [Ulster Volunteer Force](/wiki/Ulster_Volunteer_Force \"Ulster Volunteer\nForce\"), formed in 1966 in response to the perceived erosion of both the\nBritish character and unionist domination of Northern Ireland. The state\nsecurity forces – the [British Army](/wiki/British_Army \"British Army\") and\nthe police (the [Royal Ulster Constabulary](/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary\n\"Royal Ulster Constabulary\")) – were also involved in the violence. The\nBritish government's position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict,\ntrying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people\nof Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Republicans regarded the\nstate forces as [combatants](/wiki/Combatants \"Combatants\") in the conflict,\npointing to the [collusion between the state forces and the loyalist\nparamilitaries](/wiki/The_Troubles#Collusion_between_security_forces_and_loyalist_paramilitaries\n\"The Troubles\") as proof of this. The \"Ballast\" investigation by the [Police\nOmbudsman](/wiki/Police_Ombudsman \"Police Ombudsman\") has confirmed that\nBritish forces, and in particular the RUC, did collude with\n[loyalist](/wiki/Ulster_Loyalism \"Ulster Loyalism\") paramilitaries, were\ninvolved in murder, and did obstruct the course of justice when such claims\nhad been investigated,[45] although the extent to which such collusion\noccurred is still hotly disputed.\n\nAs a consequence of the worsening security situation, autonomous regional\ngovernment for Northern Ireland was suspended in 1972. Alongside the violence,\nthere was a political deadlock between the major political parties in Northern\nIreland, including those who condemned violence, over the future status of\nNorthern Ireland and the form of government there should be within Northern\nIreland. In 1973, [Northern Ireland held a\nreferendum](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_referendum,_1973 \"Northern Ireland\nreferendum, 1973\") to determine if it should remain in the United Kingdom, or\nbe part of a united Ireland. The vote went heavily in favour (98.9%) of\nmaintaining the status quo. Approximately 57.5% of the total electorate voted\nin support, but only 1% of Catholics voted following a boycott organised by\nthe [Social Democratic and Labour\nParty](/wiki/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party \"Social Democratic and Labour\nParty\") (SDLP).[46]\n\n#### Peace process\n\nMain article: [Northern Ireland peace\nprocess](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process \"Northern Ireland peace\nprocess\")\n\nThe Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a [peace\nprocess](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process \"Northern Ireland peace\nprocess\") which included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary\norganisations and the complete decommissioning of their weapons, the reform of\nthe police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets\nand from sensitive border areas such as South Armagh and\n[Fermanagh](/wiki/Fermanagh \"Fermanagh\"), as agreed by the signatories to the\nBelfast Agreement (commonly known as the \"[Good Friday\nAgreement](/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement \"Good Friday Agreement\")\"). This\nreiterated the long-held British position, which had never before been fully\nacknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will\nremain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern\nIreland decides otherwise. The [Constitution of\nIreland](/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland \"Constitution of Ireland\") was amended\nin 1999 to remove a claim of the \"Irish nation\" to sovereignty over the entire\nisland (in Article 2), a claim qualified by an acknowledgement that Ireland\ncould only exercise legal control over the territory formerly known as the\nIrish Free State.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Scottish_and_Northern_Ireland_Ministers.jpg/220px-\nScottish_and_Northern_Ireland_Ministers.jpg)](/wiki/File:Scottish_and_Northern_Ireland_Ministers.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Scottish_and_Northern_Ireland_Ministers.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFirst Minister [Ian Paisley](/wiki/Ian_Paisley \"Ian Paisley\") (DUP) center,\nhis deputy [Martin McGuinness](/wiki/Martin_McGuinness \"Martin McGuinness\")\n(Sinn Féin) left, and Scottish First Minister [Alex\nSalmond](/wiki/Alex_Salmond \"Alex Salmond\") right in 2008.\n\nThe new [Articles 2 and\n3](/wiki/Articles_2_and_3_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland \"Articles 2 and 3 of\nthe Constitution of Ireland\"), added to the Constitution to replace the\nearlier articles, implicitly acknowledge that the status of Northern Ireland,\nand its relationships within the rest of the United Kingdom and with the\nRepublic of Ireland, would only be changed with the agreement of a majority of\nvoters in each jurisdiction. This aspect was also central to the Belfast\nAgreement which was signed in 1998 and ratified by referendums held\nsimultaneously in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. At the same time,\nthe British Government recognised for the first time, as part of the\nprospective, the so-called \"Irish dimension\": the principle that the people of\nthe island of Ireland as a whole have the right, without any outside\ninterference, to solve the issues between North and South by mutual\nconsent.[47] The latter statement was key to winning support for the agreement\nfrom nationalists. It established a devolved power-sharing government within\nNorthern Ireland, which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties.\nThese institutions were suspended by the [British\nGovernment](/wiki/British_Government \"British Government\") in 2002 after\n[Police Service of Northern Ireland](/wiki/Police_Service_of_Northern_Ireland\n\"Police Service of Northern Ireland\") (PSNI) allegations of spying by people\nworking for Sinn Féin at the Assembly ([Stormontgate](/wiki/Stormontgate\n\"Stormontgate\")). The resulting case against the accused Sinn Féin member\ncollapsed.[48][49]\n\nOn 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA declared an end to its campaign and has\nsince decommissioned what is thought to be all of its [arsenal](/wiki/Arsenal\n\"Arsenal\"). This final act of decommissioning was performed in accordance with\nthe Belfast Agreement of 1998, and under the watch of the [Independent\nInternational Commission on\nDecommissioning](/wiki/Independent_International_Commission_on_Decommissioning\n\"Independent International Commission on Decommissioning\") and two external\nchurch witnesses. Many unionists, however, remain sceptical. The\n[International\nCommission](/wiki/Independent_International_Commission_on_Decommissioning\n\"Independent International Commission on Decommissioning\") later confirmed\nthat the main loyalist paramilitary groups, the UDA, UVF and the Red Hand\nCommando, had decommissioned what is thought to be all of their arsenals,\nwitnessed by a [former archbishop](/wiki/Robin_Eames \"Robin Eames\") and a\nformer top civil servant.[50]\n\nPoliticians elected to the Assembly at the [2003 Assembly\nelection](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election,_2003 \"Northern Ireland\nAssembly election, 2003\") were called together on 15 May 2006 under the\nNorthern Ireland Act 2006[51] for the purpose of electing a [First Minister\nand deputy First Minister of Northern\nIreland](/wiki/First_Minister_and_deputy_First_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland\n\"First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland\") and choosing\nthe members of an Executive (before 25 November 2006) as a preliminary step to\nthe restoration of devolved government.\n\nFollowing the [election](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election,_2007\n\"Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2007\") held on 7 March 2007, devolved\ngovernment returned on 8 May 2007 with [Democratic Unionist\nParty](/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party \"Democratic Unionist Party\") (DUP)\nleader [Ian Paisley](/wiki/Ian_Paisley \"Ian Paisley\") and Sinn Féin deputy\nleader [Martin McGuinness](/wiki/Martin_McGuinness \"Martin McGuinness\") taking\noffice as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.[52] In its\nwhite paper on [Brexit](/wiki/Brexit \"Brexit\") the United Kingdom government\nreiterated its commitment to the Belfast Agreement. With regard to Northern\nIreland's status, it said that the UK Government's \"clearly-stated preference\nis to retain Northern Ireland’s current constitutional position: as part of\nthe UK, but with strong links to Ireland\".[53]\n\n## Politics\n\nMain article: [Politics of Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Politics_of_Northern_Ireland \"Politics of Northern Ireland\")\n\n### Background\n\nThe main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish\nto see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and\nnationalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland unified with the Republic of\nIreland, independent from the United Kingdom. These two opposing views are\nlinked to deeper cultural divisions. Unionists are predominantly [Ulster\nProtestant](/wiki/Ulster_Protestant \"Ulster Protestant\"), descendants of\nmainly [Scottish](/wiki/Scottish_people \"Scottish people\"), English, and\n[Huguenot](/wiki/Huguenot \"Huguenot\") settlers as well as [Gaels](/wiki/Gaels\n\"Gaels\") who converted to one of the Protestant denominations. Nationalists\nare overwhelmingly Catholic and descend from the population predating the\nsettlement, with a minority from the [Scottish\nHighlands](/wiki/Scottish_Highlands \"Scottish Highlands\") as well as some\nconverts from Protestantism. Discrimination against nationalists under the\n[Stormont](/wiki/Parliament_Buildings_\\(Northern_Ireland\\) \"Parliament\nBuildings \\(Northern Ireland\\)\") government (1921–1972) gave rise to the civil\nrights movement in the 1960s.[54]\n\nWhile some unionists argue that discrimination was not just due to religious\nor political bigotry, but also the result of more complex socio-economic,\nsocio-political and geographical factors,[55] its existence, and the manner in\nwhich nationalist anger at it was handled, were a major contributing factor to\nthe Troubles. The political unrest went through its most violent phase between\n1968 and 1994.[56]\n\nIn 2007, 36% of the population defined themselves as unionist, 24% as\nnationalist and 40% defined themselves as neither.[57] According to a 2015\nopinion poll, 70% express a long-term preference of the maintenance of\nNorthern Ireland's membership of the United Kingdom (either [directly\nruled](/wiki/Direct_rule \"Direct rule\") or with [devolved\ngovernment](/wiki/Devolution \"Devolution\")), while 14% express a preference\nfor membership of a united Ireland.[58] This discrepancy can be explained by\nthe overwhelming preference among Protestants to remain a part of the UK\n(93%), while Catholic preferences are spread across a number of solutions to\nthe constitutional question including remaining a part of the UK (47%), a\nunited Ireland (32%), Northern Ireland becoming an independent state (4%), and\nthose who \"don't know\" (16%).[59]\n\nOfficial voting figures, which reflect views on the \"national question\" along\nwith issues of candidate, geography, personal loyalty and historic voting\npatterns, show 54% of Northern Ireland voters vote for unionist parties, 42%\nvote for nationalist parties and 4% vote \"other\". Opinion polls consistently\nshow that the election results are not necessarily an indication of the\nelectorate's stance regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.\nMost of the population of Northern Ireland are at least nominally Christian,\nmostly Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations. Many voters (regardless of\nreligious affiliation) are attracted to unionism's\n[conservative](/wiki/National_conservatism \"National conservatism\") policies,\nwhile other voters are instead attracted to the traditionally leftist Sinn\nFéin and SDLP and their respective party platforms for [democratic\nsocialism](/wiki/Democratic_socialism \"Democratic socialism\") and [social\ndemocracy](/wiki/Social_democracy \"Social democracy\").[60]\n\nFor the most part, Protestants feel a strong connection with Great Britain and\nwish for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Many Catholics\nhowever, generally aspire to a United Ireland or are less certain about how to\nsolve the constitutional question. In the 2015 survey by Northern Ireland Life\nand Times, 47% of Northern Irish Catholics supported Northern Ireland\nremaining a part of the United Kingdom, either by direct rule (6%) or devolved\ngovernment (41%).\n\nProtestants have a slight majority in Northern Ireland, according to the\nlatest Northern Ireland Census. The make-up of the [Northern Ireland\nAssembly](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly \"Northern Ireland Assembly\")\nreflects the appeals of the various parties within the population. Of the 108\n[Members of the Legislative Assembly\n(MLAs)](/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_\\(Northern_Ireland\\) \"Member\nof the Legislative Assembly \\(Northern Ireland\\)\"), 56 are unionists and 40\nare nationalists (the remaining 12 are classified as \"other\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Governance\n\nMain articles: [Elections in Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Elections_in_Northern_Ireland \"Elections in Northern Ireland\")\nand [Northern Ireland law](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_law \"Northern Ireland law\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/StormontGeneral.jpg/220px-\nStormontGeneral.jpg)](/wiki/File:StormontGeneral.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:StormontGeneral.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Parliament Buildings](/wiki/Parliament_Buildings_\\(Northern_Ireland\\)\n\"Parliament Buildings \\(Northern Ireland\\)\") at\n[Stormont](/wiki/Parliament_Buildings_\\(Northern_Ireland\\) \"Parliament\nBuildings \\(Northern Ireland\\)\"), Belfast, seat of the assembly.\n\nSince 1998, Northern Ireland has had [devolved](/wiki/Devolution \"Devolution\")\ngovernment within the United Kingdom. The UK Government and UK Parliament are\nresponsible for [reserved and excepted\nmatters](/wiki/Reserved_and_excepted_matters \"Reserved and excepted matters\").\nReserved matters comprise listed policy areas (such as [civil\naviation](/wiki/Civil_aviation \"Civil aviation\"), [units of\nmeasurement](/wiki/Units_of_measurement \"Units of measurement\"), and [human\ngenetics](/wiki/Human_genetics \"Human genetics\")) that Parliament may devolve\nto the Northern Ireland Assembly some time in the future. Excepted matters\n(such as [international relations](/wiki/International_relations\n\"International relations\"), taxation and elections) are never expected to be\nconsidered for devolution. On all other governmental matters, the [Northern\nIreland Executive](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Executive \"Northern Ireland\nExecutive\") together with the 108-member [Northern Ireland\nAssembly](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly \"Northern Ireland Assembly\") may\nlegislate for and govern Northern Ireland.

However, not all of these take their seats. Sinn Féin MPs, currently\nfive, refuse to take the oath to serve the Queen that is required before MPs\nare allowed to take their seats. In addition, the upper house of the UK\nparliament, the [House of Lords](/wiki/House_of_Lords \"House of Lords\"),\ncurrently has some 25 appointed [members from Northern\nIreland](/wiki/List_of_Northern_Ireland_members_of_the_House_of_Lords \"List of\nNorthern Ireland members of the House of Lords\").

[Northern Ireland\nlaw](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_law \"Northern Ireland law\") developed from Irish\nlaw that existed before the [partition of Ireland](/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland\n\"Partition of Ireland\") in 1921. Northern Ireland is a [common\nlaw](/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") jurisdiction and its common law is similar\nto that in England and Wales. However, there are important differences in law\nand procedure between Northern Ireland and England and Wales. The body of\n[statute law](/wiki/Statutory_law \"Statutory law\") affecting Northern Ireland\nreflects the history of Northern Ireland, including Acts of the Parliament of\nthe United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the former [Parliament of\nNorthern Ireland](/wiki/Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland \"Parliament of Northern\nIreland\") and the [Parliament of Ireland](/wiki/Parliament_of_Ireland\n\"Parliament of Ireland\"), along with some Acts of the [Parliament of\nEngland](/wiki/Parliament_of_England \"Parliament of England\") and of the\n[Parliament of Great Britain](/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain \"Parliament of\nGreat Britain\") that were extended to Ireland under [Poynings'\nLaw](/wiki/Poynings%27_Law \"Poynings' Law\") between 1494 and 1782.\n\n### Descriptions\n\nThere is no generally accepted term to describe what Northern Ireland is:\nprovince, region, country or something else.[11][12][13] The choice of term\ncan be controversial and can reveal the writer's political preferences.[12]\nThis has been noted as a problem by several writers on Northern Ireland, with\nno generally recommended solution.[11][12][13]\n\nOwing in part to the way in which the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland,\ncame into being, there is no legally defined term to describe what Northern\nIreland 'is'. There is also no uniform or guiding way to refer to Northern\nIreland amongst the agencies of the UK government. For example, the websites\nof the Office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom[61] and the [UK\nStatistics Authority](/wiki/UK_Statistics_Authority \"UK Statistics Authority\")\ndescribe the United Kingdom as being made up of four countries, one of these\nbeing Northern Ireland.[62] Other pages on the same websites refer to Northern\nIreland specifically as a \"province\" as do publications of the UK Statistics\nAuthority.[63][64] The website of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research\nAgency also refers to Northern Ireland as being a province[65] as does the\nwebsite of the Office of Public Sector Information[66] and other agencies\nwithin Northern Ireland.[67] Publications of [HM Treasury](/wiki/HM_Treasury\n\"HM Treasury\")[68] and the Department of Finance and Personnel of the Northern\nIreland Executive,[69] on the other hand, describe Northern Ireland as being a\n\"region of the UK\". The UK's submission to the 2007 [United Nations Conference\non the Standardization of Geographical\nNames](/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_the_Standardization_of_Geographical_Names\n\"United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names\")\ndefines the UK as being made up of two countries (England and Scotland), one\n[principality](/wiki/Principality \"Principality\") (Wales) and one province\n(Northern Ireland).[70]\n\nUnlike England, Scotland and Wales, Northern Ireland has no history of being\nan independent country or of being a nation in its own right.[71] Some writers\ndescribe the United Kingdom as being made up of three countries and one\nprovince[72] or point out the difficulties with calling Northern Ireland a\ncountry.[73] Authors writing specifically about Northern Ireland dismiss the\nidea that Northern Ireland is a \"country\" in general terms,[11][13][74][75]\nand draw contrasts in this respect with England, Scotland and Wales.[76] Even\nfor the period covering the first 50 years of Northern Ireland's existence,\nthe term _country_ is considered inappropriate by some political scientists on\nthe basis that many decisions were still made in London.[71] The absence of a\ndistinct nation of Northern Ireland, separate within the island of Ireland, is\nalso pointed out as being a problem with using the term[13][77][78] and is in\ncontrast to England, Scotland, and Wales.[79]\n\nMany commentators prefer to use the term \"province\", although that is also not\nwithout problems. It can arouse irritation, particularly among nationalists,\nfor whom the title province is properly reserved for the traditional province\nof Ulster, of which Northern Ireland comprises six out of nine\ncounties.[12][73] The BBC style guide is to refer to Northern Ireland as a\nprovince, and use of the term is common in literature and newspaper reports on\nNorthern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Some authors have described the\nmeaning of this term as being equivocal: referring to Northern Ireland as\nbeing a province both of the United Kingdom and of the traditional country of\nIreland.[77]\n\n\"Region\" is used by several UK government agencies and the European Union.\nSome authors choose this word but note that it is \"unsatisfactory\".[12][13]\nNorthern Ireland can also be simply described as \"part of the UK\", including\nby UK government offices.[61]\n\n### Alternative names\n\nMain article: [Alternative names for Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Alternative_names_for_Northern_Ireland \"Alternative names for\nNorthern Ireland\")\n\nMany people inside and outside Northern Ireland use other names for Northern\nIreland, depending on their point of view. Disagreement on names, and the\nreading of political symbolism into the use or non-use of a word, also\nattaches itself to some urban centres. The most notable example is whether\nNorthern Ireland's second city should be called [\"Derry\" or\n\"Londonderry\"](/wiki/Derry-Londonderry_name_dispute \"Derry-Londonderry name\ndispute\").\n\nChoice of language and [nomenclature](/wiki/Nomenclature \"Nomenclature\") in\nNorthern Ireland often reveals the cultural, ethnic and religious identity of\nthe speaker. The first [Deputy First Minister of Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland \"Deputy First\nMinister of Northern Ireland\"), [Seamus Mallon](/wiki/Seamus_Mallon \"Seamus\nMallon\"), was criticised by unionist politicians for calling the region the\n\"North of Ireland\" while Sinn Féin has been criticised in a Dublin newspaper\nfor referring to the \"Six Counties\".[80]\n\nThose who do not belong to any group but lean towards one side often tend to\nuse the language of that group. Supporters of unionism in the British media\n(notably _[The Daily Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph \"The Daily\nTelegraph\")_ and the _[Daily Express](/wiki/Daily_Express \"Daily Express\")_)\nregularly call Northern Ireland \"Ulster\".[81] Some media outlets in the\nRepublic use \"North of Ireland\", \"the North\", or (less often) the \"Six\nCounties\".\n\nGovernment and cultural organisations in Northern Ireland often use the word\n\"Ulster\" in their title; for example, the [University of\nUlster](/wiki/University_of_Ulster \"University of Ulster\"), the [Ulster\nMuseum](/wiki/Ulster_Museum \"Ulster Museum\"), the [Ulster\nOrchestra](/wiki/Ulster_Orchestra \"Ulster Orchestra\"), and [BBC Radio\nUlster](/wiki/BBC_Radio_Ulster \"BBC Radio Ulster\").\n\nAlthough some news bulletins since the 1990s have opted to avoid all\ncontentious terms and use the official name, Northern Ireland, the term \"the\nNorth\" remains commonly used by broadcast media in the Republic. For Northern\nIreland's second largest city, broadcasting outlets which are unaligned to\neither community and broadcast to both use both names interchangeably, often\nstarting a report with \"Londonderry\" and then using \"Derry\" in the rest of the\nreport. However, within Northern Ireland, print media which are aligned to\neither ideology (the _[Belfast Telegraph](/wiki/Belfast_Telegraph \"Belfast\nTelegraph\")_ and _[News Letter](/wiki/News_Letter \"News Letter\")_ are unionist\nin outlook while the _[Irish News](/wiki/Irish_News \"Irish News\")_ is\nnationalist) generally use their preferred term. British newspapers with\nunionist leanings, such as _[The Daily Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph\n\"The Daily Telegraph\")_ , usually use unionist language. However the more\nleft-wing _[Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_ recommends in its\nstyle guide using \"Derry\" and \"County Derry\", and \"not Londonderry\".[82]\n\nThe division in nomenclature is sometimes seen in the names of organisations\nassociated with either side of the political divide, but there are exceptions.\nIn [Gaelic games](/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association \"Gaelic Athletic\nAssociation\"), followed mainly by nationalists, the [GAA\ncounty](/wiki/GAA_county \"GAA county\") is \"[Derry](/wiki/Derry_GAA \"Derry\nGAA\")\", but in sports followed mainly by unionists, clubs tend to avoid the\nuse of \"Londonderry\" in favour of more precise locales ([Glendermott Cricket\nClub](/wiki/Glendermott_Cricket_Club \"Glendermott Cricket Club\")) or neutral\nterms ([Foyle Hockey Club](/wiki/Ulster_Hockey_Union#Current_membership\n\"Ulster Hockey Union\")). \"Derry\" is also used in the names of both the [Church\nof Ireland](/wiki/Diocese_of_Derry_and_Raphoe \"Diocese of Derry and Raphoe\")\nand [Roman Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Derry \"Roman Catholic\nDiocese of Derry\") dioceses, and by one of the largest Protestant [fraternal\nsocieties](/wiki/Fraternal_organisation \"Fraternal organisation\"), the\n[Apprentice Boys of Derry](/wiki/Apprentice_Boys_of_Derry \"Apprentice Boys of\nDerry\"). There is no agreement on how to decide on a name. When the\nnationalist-controlled local council voted to rename the city \"Derry\",\nunionists objected, stating that as it owed its city status to a [Royal\nCharter](/wiki/Royal_Charter \"Royal Charter\"), only a charter issued by the\n[Queen](/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Elizabeth II of the United\nKingdom\") could change the name. The Queen has not intervened on the matter\nand thus the council is now called the Derry City Council while the city is\nstill officially Londonderry. Nevertheless, the council has printed two sets\nof stationery—one for each term—and its policy is to reply to correspondence\nusing whichever term the original sender used.\n\n#### Unionist\n\n  * **Ulster** , strictly speaking, refers to the province of [Ulster](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\"), of which six of nine historical counties are in Northern Ireland. The term \"Ulster\" is widely used by unionists and the British press as shorthand for Northern Ireland, and is also favoured by [Ulster nationalists](/wiki/Ulster_nationalism \"Ulster nationalism\").[83] In the past, calls have been made for Northern Ireland's name to be changed to Ulster. This proposal was formally considered by the Government of Northern Ireland in 1937 and by the UK Government in 1949 but no change was made.[84]\n  * **The Province** refers to the historic Irish province of Ulster but today is used by some as shorthand for Northern Ireland. The [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\"), in its editorial guidance for _Reporting the United Kingdom_ , states that \"the Province\" is an appropriate secondary synonym for Northern Ireland, while \"Ulster\" is not. It also suggests that \"people of Northern Ireland\" is preferred to \"British\" or \"Irish\", and the term \"mainland\" should be avoided in reference to Great Britain in relation to Northern Ireland.[85]\n\n#### Nationalist\n\n  * **North of Ireland** – used to avoid using the name given by the British-enacted Government of Ireland Act 1920.\n  * **The Six Counties** (na Sé Chontae) – the Republic of Ireland is similarly described as the Twenty-Six Counties.[86] Some of the users of these terms contend that using the official name of the region would imply acceptance of the legitimacy of the Government of Ireland Act.\n  * **The Occupied Six Counties** – used by some republicans.[87] The Republic, whose legitimacy is similarly not recognised by republicans opposed to the Belfast Agreement, is described as the \"Free State\", referring to the [Irish Free State](/wiki/Irish_Free_State \"Irish Free State\"), which gained independence (as a [Dominion](/wiki/Dominion \"Dominion\")) in 1922.[88]\n  * **British-Occupied Ireland** – Similar in tone to the Occupied Six Counties,[89] this term is used by more dogmatic republicans, such as [Republican Sinn Féin](/wiki/Republican_Sinn_F%C3%A9in \"Republican Sinn Féin\"),[90] who still hold that the [Second Dáil](/wiki/Second_D%C3%A1il \"Second Dáil\") was the last legitimate government of Ireland and that all governments since have been foreign-imposed usurpations of Irish national self-determination.[91]\n\n#### Other\n\n  * **Norn Iron** or \"Norniron\" – is an informal and affectionate[92] local nickname used by both nationalists[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] and unionists to refer to Northern Ireland, derived from the pronunciation of the words \"Northern Ireland\" in an exaggerated Ulster accent (particularly one from the greater Belfast area). The phrase is seen as a lighthearted way to refer to Northern Ireland, based as it is on regional pronunciation. It often refers to the [Northern Ireland national football team](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_national_football_team \"Northern Ireland national football team\").[93]\n\n## Geography and climate\n\nMain articles: [Geography of Ireland](/wiki/Geography_of_Ireland \"Geography of\nIreland\") and [Geography of the United\nKingdom](/wiki/Geography_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Geography of the United\nKingdom\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/NI_koeppen.png/220px-\nNI_koeppen.png)](/wiki/File:NI_koeppen.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NI_koeppen.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Köppen climate types](/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification \"Köppen\nclimate classification\") of Northern Ireland\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Lough_Neagh_-\n_geograph.org.uk_-_488526.jpg/220px-Lough_Neagh_-\n_geograph.org.uk_-_488526.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lough_Neagh_-\n_geograph.org.uk_-_488526.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Lough_Neagh_-_geograph.org.uk_-_488526.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Lough Neagh](/wiki/Lough_Neagh \"Lough Neagh\")\n\nNorthern Ireland was covered by an [ice sheet](/wiki/Ice_sheet \"Ice sheet\")\nfor most of the [last ice age](/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation \"Quaternary\nglaciation\") and on numerous previous occasions, the legacy of which can be\nseen in the extensive coverage of [drumlins](/wiki/Drumlin \"Drumlin\") in\nCounties Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim and particularly Down.\n\nThe centrepiece of Northern Ireland's geography is [Lough\nNeagh](/wiki/Lough_Neagh \"Lough Neagh\"), at 151 square miles (391 km2) the\nlargest freshwater lake both on the island of Ireland and in the [British\nIsles](/wiki/British_Isles \"British Isles\").

Average daytime maximums in Belfast are\n6.5 °C (43.7 °F) in January and 17.5 °C (63.5 °F) in July. The highest maximum\ntemperature recorded was 30.8 °C (87.4 °F) at Knockarevan, near [Garrison,\nCounty Fermanagh](/wiki/Garrison,_County_Fermanagh \"Garrison, County\nFermanagh\") on 30 June 1976 and at Belfast on 12 July 1983.[94] The lowest\nminimum temperature recorded was −18.7 °C (−1.7 °F) at\n[Castlederg](/wiki/Castlederg \"Castlederg\"), [County\nTyrone](/wiki/County_Tyrone \"County Tyrone\") on 23 December 2010.[95]\n\n### Counties\n\nMain article: [Counties of Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Counties_of_Northern_Ireland \"Counties of Northern Ireland\")\n\nNorthern Ireland consists of six historic [counties](/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland\n\"Counties of Ireland\"): [County Antrim](/wiki/County_Antrim \"County Antrim\"),\n[County Armagh](/wiki/County_Armagh \"County Armagh\"), [County\nDown](/wiki/County_Down \"County Down\"), [County\nFermanagh](/wiki/County_Fermanagh \"County Fermanagh\"), [County\nLondonderry](/wiki/County_Londonderry \"County Londonderry\"),[96] [County\nTyrone](/wiki/County_Tyrone \"County Tyrone\").\n\nThese counties are no longer used for local government purposes; instead there\nare eleven [districts of Northern Ireland](/wiki/Districts_of_Northern_Ireland\n\"Districts of Northern Ireland\") which have different geographical extents.\nThese were created in 2015, replacing the twenty-six districts which\npreviously existed.[97]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/MussendenTemple.jpg/220px-\nMussendenTemple.jpg)](/wiki/File:MussendenTemple.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MussendenTemple.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Mussenden Temple](/wiki/Mussenden_Temple \"Mussenden Temple\"), [County\nLondonderry](/wiki/County_Londonderry \"County Londonderry\")\n\nAlthough counties are no longer used for local governmental purposes, they\nremain a popular means of describing where places are. They are officially\nused while applying for an [Irish passport](/wiki/Irish_passport \"Irish\npassport\"), which requires one to state one's county of birth. The name of\nthat county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's\ninformation page, as opposed to the town or city of birth on the United\nKingdom passport. The [Gaelic Athletic\nAssociation](/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association \"Gaelic Athletic Association\")\nstill uses the counties as its primary means of organisation and fields\nrepresentative teams of each [GAA county](/wiki/GAA_county \"GAA county\").

In 2000, the\n[telephone numbering system](/wiki/Big_Number_Change#Northern_Ireland \"Big\nNumber Change\") was restructured into an 8 digit scheme with (except for\nBelfast) the first digit approximately reflecting the county.\n\nThe county boundaries still appear on Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland Maps\nand the Phillips Street Atlases, among others. With their decline in official\nuse, there is often confusion surrounding towns and cities which lie near\ncounty boundaries, such as Belfast and [Lisburn](/wiki/Lisburn \"Lisburn\"),\nwhich are split between counties Down and Antrim (the majorities of both\ncities, however, are in Antrim).\n\n## Economy\n\nMain articles: [Economy of Northern Ireland](/wiki/Economy_of_Northern_Ireland\n\"Economy of Northern Ireland\") and [Transport in Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Transport_in_Northern_Ireland \"Transport in Northern Ireland\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/%27Titanic_Quarter%27_development%2C_Abercorn_Basin%2C_Belfast_-\n_geograph.org.uk_-_1378153.jpg/220px-%27Titanic_Quarter%27_development%2C_Abercorn_Basin%2C_Belfast_-\n_geograph.org.uk_-_1378153.jpg)](/wiki/File:%27Titanic_Quarter%27_development,_Abercorn_Basin,_Belfast_-\n_geograph.org.uk_-_1378153.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:%27Titanic_Quarter%27_development,_Abercorn_Basin,_Belfast_-\n_geograph.org.uk_-_1378153.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGoliath crane of [Harland & Wolff](/wiki/Harland_%26_Wolff \"Harland & Wolff\")\nin [Belfast](/wiki/Belfast \"Belfast\").\n\nNorthern Ireland has traditionally had an industrial economy, most notably in\nshipbuilding, rope manufacture and textiles, but most heavy industry has since\nbeen replaced by services, primarily the public sector.

The demise of the Parliamentary Party stands in direct parallel to the just as rapidly diminishing power of its symbols. The green flag and 'God save Ireland' began to be discredited as symbols of constitutional nationalism and, instead, the symbols of revolutionary nationalism gained popularity as the majority of the Irish people identified itself with the political aims of the Easter revolutionaries. The use of symbols made apparent that the occurrences of 1916 initiated a new epoch in Irish history much in the same as the Union of 1801 and the Famine of 1845–8 did.\"\n\n\"Both the national flag and the national anthem of present-day Ireland drive\norigins directly from the Rising. At first it still appeared as if the\nrevolutionaries would take over the old symbols because on the roof of their\nheadquarters, the Dublin General Post Office, a green flag with the harp was\nhoisted next to the republican tricolour although with the inscription 'Irish\nRepublic'. Even 'Got save Ireland' was sung by the revolutionaries during\nEaster week. But after the failure of the Rising and the subsequent executions\nof the leading revolutionaries the tricolour and 'The Soldier's Song' became\nmore and more popular as symbols of the rebellion.\"\n\n  136. **Jump up ^** [Vandals curbed by plastic edging](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7748005.stm) BBC News, 25 November 2008.\n  137. **Jump up ^** [\"Statutory Rule 2000 No. 347\"](http://www.opsi.gov.uk/sr/sr2000/20000347.htm).
