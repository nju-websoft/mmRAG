When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960, resulting in the\n[International System of Units](/wiki/International_System_of_Units\n\"International System of Units\") (SI), the _are_ was not included as a\nrecognised unit. The hectare, however, remains as a non-SI unit accepted for\nuse with the SI units, mentioned in Section 4.1 of the SI Brochure as a unit\nwhose use is \"expected to continue indefinitely\".[1]\n\nComparison of [area units](/wiki/Template:Convert/list_of_units/area \"Template:Convert/list of units/area\") Unit | SI  \n---|---  \n1 ca | 1 m2  \n1 a | 100 m2  \n1 ha | 10,000 m2  \n100 ha | 1,000,000 m2  \n1 km2  \nnon-SI comparisons  \nnon-SI | metric  \n0.3861 sq mi | 1 km2  \n2.471 acre | 1 ha  \n107,639 sq ft | 1 ha  \n1 sq mi | 259.0 ha  \n1 acre | 0.4047 ha  \n  \n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Units\n    * 2.1 Centiare\n    * 2.2 Deciare\n    * 2.3 Are\n    * 2.4 Decare\n    * 2.5 Hectare\n  * 3 Conversions\n  * 4 Visualising a hectare\n    * 4.1 International rugby pitch\n    * 4.2 Statue of Liberty\n    * 4.3 Interior of all-weather athletics track\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 Notes\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hectare&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nThe metric system of measurement was first given a legal basis in 1795 by the\n[French Revolutionary](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French Revolution\")\ngovernment. The law of [18 Germinal, Year\nIII](/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar \"French Republican Calendar\") (7 April\n1795) defined five units of measure:[2]\n\n  * The [metre](/wiki/Metre \"Metre\") for length\n  * The [are](/wiki/Hectare#Are \"Hectare\") (100 m2) for area [of land]\n  * The [stère](/wiki/Stere \"Stere\") (1 m3) for volume of stacked firewood[3]\n  * The [litre](/wiki/Litre \"Litre\") (1 dm3) for volumes of liquid\n  * The gram for mass\n\nAlthough the law defined the length of the metre, there was no practical way\nof accurately measuring the metre (and hence the _are_) until 1799 when the\nfirst standard metre was manufactured and adopted.\n\nThe standard metre remained in the custody of successive French governments\nuntil 1875 when, under the [Convention of the Metre](/wiki/Metre_Convention\n\"Metre Convention\"), its supervision passed into international control under\nthe auspices of the [General Conference on Weights and\nMeasures](/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures \"General Conference\non Weights and Measures\") (CGPM). At the first meeting of the CGPM in 1889\nwhen a new standard metre, manufactured by [Johnson\nMatthey](/wiki/Johnson_Matthey \"Johnson Matthey\") & Co of London[4] was\nadopted, the _are_ and _hectare_ were automatically redefined.\n\nIn 1960, when the metric system was updated as the International System of\nUnits (SI), the _are_ did not receive international recognition. The\n[International Committee for Weights and\nMeasures](/wiki/Comit%C3%A9_International_des_Poids_et_Mesures \"Comité\nInternational des Poids et Mesures\") (CIPM) makes no mention of the _are_ in\nthe current (2006) definition of the SI, but classifies the hectare as a \"Non-\nSI unit accepted for use with the International System of Units\"[5]\n\nIn 1972, the [European Economic Community](/wiki/European_Economic_Community\n\"European Economic Community\") (EEC) passed directive 71/354/EEC,[6] which\ncatalogued the units of measure that might be used within the Community. The\nunits that were catalogued replicated the recommendations of the CGPM,\nsupplemented by a few other units including the _are_ (and implicitly the\n_hectare_) whose use was limited to the measurement of land.\n\nMany UK farmers, especially older ones, still use the [acre](/wiki/Acre\n\"Acre\") for everyday calculations, and convert to hectares only for official\n(especially European Union) paperwork. Farm fields can have very long\nhistories which are resistant to change, with names such as \"the six acre\nfield\" stretching back hundreds of years and across generations of family\nfarmers. Some younger agricultural workers are now beginning to think in\nhectares as their \"first language\", though this is more typical of\nprofessional consultants and managers than of traditional farming and land-\nowning families, and in some circles may be viewed as a social class\nindicator.\n\n## Units[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hectare&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Units\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Hectare_Diagram.svg/300px-\nHectare_Diagram.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Hectare_Diagram.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hectare_Diagram.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDefinition of a _hectare_ and of an _are_.\n\nThe names _centiare_ , _deciare_ , _decare_ and _hectare_ are derived by\nadding the standard [metric prefixes](/wiki/Metric_prefix \"Metric prefix\") to\nthe original base unit of area, the _are_.\n\n### Centiare[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hectare&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Centiare\")]\n\nThe **centiare** is one square metre.\n\n### Deciare[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hectare&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Deciare\")]\n\nThe **deciare** is ten square metres.\n\n### Are[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hectare&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section:\nAre\")]\n\nThe **are** ([/ɑːr/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\")[7] or\n[/ɛər/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\")[8]) is a unit of area,\nequal to 100 square metres (10 m × 10 m), used for measuring land area. It was\ndefined by older forms of the [metric system](/wiki/Metric_system \"Metric\nsystem\"), but is now outside the modern [International System of\nUnits](/wiki/International_System_of_Units \"International System of Units\")\n(SI).[9] It is still commonly used in colloquial speech to measure real\nestate, in particular in Indonesia, India, and in various European countries.\n\nIn [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language \"Russian language\") and other languages of\nthe former [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\"), the _are_ is\ncalled _sotka_ (Russian: сотка: 'a hundred', i.e. 100 m2). It is used to\ndescribe the size of suburban [dacha](/wiki/Dacha \"Dacha\") or [allotment\ngarden](/wiki/Allotment_garden \"Allotment garden\") plots or small city parks\nwhere the hectare would be too large.\n\nEtymologically, the word _are_ finds its roots in the\n[Talmudic](/wiki/Talmudic \"Talmudic\") [Aramaic](/wiki/Aramaic \"Aramaic\") word\nארעא (_araa_), meaning \"land\".[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Decare[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hectare&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Decare\")]\n\nThe **decare** ([/ˈdɛkɑːr, -ɛər/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\"))\nis derived from _[deca](/wiki/Deca- \"Deca-\")_ and _[are](/wiki/Hectare#Are\n\"Hectare\")_ , and is equal to 10 ares or 1000 square metres. It is used in\nNorway[10] and in the former [Ottoman](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman Empire\")\nareas of the Middle East and the Balkans (Bulgaria)[11] as a measure of land\narea. Instead of the name \"decare\", the names of traditional land measures are\nusually used, redefined as one decare:\n\n  * [Stremma](/wiki/Stremma \"Stremma\") in Greece[12]\n  * [Dunam](/wiki/Dunam \"Dunam\"), dunum, donum, or dönüm in Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey[13]\n  * Mål is sometimes used for decare in Norway, from the old measure of about the same area.\n\n### Hectare[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hectare&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Hectare\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Trafalgar_Square%2C_London_2_-_Jun_2009.jpg/300px-\nTrafalgar_Square%2C_London_2_-_Jun_2009.jpg)](/wiki/File:Trafalgar_Square,_London_2_-_Jun_2009.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Trafalgar_Square,_London_2_-_Jun_2009.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Trafalgar Square](/wiki/Trafalgar_Square \"Trafalgar Square\") has an area of\nabout one hectare.[14]\n\nThe **hectare** ([/ˈhɛktɛər, -tɑːr/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English\n\"Help:IPA/English\")[15]), although not a unit of SI, is the only named unit of\narea that is [accepted for use within the SI](/wiki/Non-\nSI_units_mentioned_in_the_SI#Units_officially_accepted_for_use_with_the_SI\n\"Non-SI units mentioned in the SI\").[16] In practice the hectare is fully\nderived from the SI, being equivalent to a square hectometre. It is widely\nused throughout the world for the measurement of large areas of land, and it\nis the legal unit of measure in domains concerned with land ownership,\nplanning, and [management](/wiki/Land_management \"Land management\"), including\nlaw ([land deeds](/wiki/Deed \"Deed\")), agriculture, [forestry](/wiki/Forestry\n\"Forestry\"), and [town planning](/wiki/Town_planning \"Town planning\")\nthroughout the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\").[17]\nThe United Kingdom,[18] United States, Burma,[19][20] and to some extent\nCanada use the acre instead.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nSome countries that underwent a general conversion from traditional\nmeasurements to [metric](/wiki/Metric_system \"Metric system\") measurements\n(e.g. Canada) required a resurvey when units of measure in legal descriptions\nrelating to land were converted to metric units.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Others,\nsuch as South Africa, published conversion factors which were to be used\nparticularly \"when preparing consolidation diagrams by compilation\".[21]\n\nIn many countries, metrication redefined or clarified existing measures in\nterms of metric units.
