Casada, the Tennessee House Republican caucus chairman,\nsaid that he believes Obama has further proof of eligibility, and would like\nhim to make it available: \"Yes, people may say, you're just chasing some\nconspiracy theory ... [but] it's a simple act on his part to just do, and\nwe're done—move on.\" The alternative newspaper _[Nashville\nScene](/wiki/Nashville_Scene \"Nashville Scene\")_ described Swafford as joining\na \"wacky legal action\" and quoted Tennessee house Democrat Larry Miller as\nsaying: \"What is the mentality of these kind of people who continuously make\nthese kind of goofy statements? It's embarrassing.\" Attorney Orly Taitz of\nCalifornia said she planned to file the suit, representing the Defend Our\nFreedoms Foundation.[73][74]\n\nLegislation proposed in January 2011 would require anyone running for elected\noffice to furnish a birth certificate before being declared an eligible\ncandidate.\"[75] It failed to be voted out of a subcommittee.[76]\n\nIn January 2016, two Democratic legislators proposed barring the Secretary of\nState from placing on the ballot any presidential or vice-presidential\ncandidate who was not a natural-born citizen.[77]\n\n###\nTexas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_eligibility_legislation&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Texas\")]\n\nOn November 16, 2010, Texas state representative [Leo Berman](/wiki/Leo_Berman\n\"Leo Berman\") introduced legislation requiring any candidate for president or\nvice president running in Texas to submit to the [Texas Secretary of\nState](/wiki/Texas_Secretary_of_State \"Texas Secretary of State\") an \"original\nbirth certificate indicating that the person is a natural-born United States\ncitizen.\" In introducing the bill, Berman said that the \"bill is necessary\nbecause we have a president whom the American people don't know whether he was\nborn in Kenya or some other place.\" If signed into law, the bill would take\neffect September 1, 2011, about 6 months ahead of the Texas presidential\nprimaries for the [2012 presidential\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012 \"United States\npresidential election, 2012\").[78]\n\nBy inserting the word \"original\" into the bill, Berman addressed concerns by\nconspiracy theorists that other bills that do not contain that word are\n\"flawed\". His bill would therefore specifically disallow the use of the\nreproduced certificate that Obama has used since June 2008 as evidence. The\nlegality of such a bill is unknown, as reproduced certificates are generally\naccepted by government agencies as proof of birth.[79]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_eligibility_legislation&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Barack Obama presidential eligibility litigation](/wiki/Barack_Obama_presidential_eligibility_litigation \"Barack Obama presidential eligibility litigation\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_eligibility_legislation&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [The U.S. Constitution With Declaration of Independence, US Government Printing Office](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_documents&docid=f:sd011.105.pdf)\n  2. **Jump up ^** [Smith, Ben](/wiki/Ben_Smith_\\(journalist\\) \"Ben Smith \\(journalist\\)\") (May 13, 2010).
