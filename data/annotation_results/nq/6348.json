However, most of the\nvillagers think he is insane for crafting devices believed ridiculous and\nimpossible to construct in reality.\n\nDuring the beginning of the movie, he is working on a machine that\nautomatically chops up firewood. Once it is successfully working, he leaves\nfor the County Fair to display his invention. However, he is unable to make it\nto the fair due to getting lost in the woods. After going down a path that\nresults in the loss of his horse and cart, and being attacked and nearly\nkilled by a pack of rabid [wolves](/wiki/Gray_wolf \"Gray wolf\"), he winds up\nat the gate of a dark castle. When he enters the castle to stay for the night,\nhe ends up being locked up by the Beast, the castle's master.\n\nBelle learns of what happened and goes to the castle, attempting to release\nher father. She then tries to convince the Beast to release him from the\ncastle. She succeeds in convincing the Beast to release him, under the\ncondition that she is to take her father's place, to Maurice's protests.\nMaurice is forcibly taken back to the village.\n\nUpon returning to the village, Maurice tries to seek the villagers' help in\ntrying to rescue Belle, but they don't believe him, and they consequently\nthrow him out of the tavern.\n\nDetermined to not give up on Belle, he decides to return to the castle alone.\nHowever, it doesn't take long before he succumbs to an unknown illness due to\nthe cold weather. Luckily, Belle discovers that her father is in trouble via\nthe Beast's Magic Mirror and is released by the Beast so she can save him.\nShortly after arriving back home, Le Fou has alarmed the villagers of their\nreturn. Shortly thereafter, Monsieur D'Arque, the keeper of the Maison de\nLunes Insane Asylum, and the other villagers come to take Maurice to the\ninsane asylum in an intricate plan to blackmail Belle into marrying Gaston.\nBelle reveals that Maurice's rants are true and that the Beast does exist.\nBoth she and Maurice are locked up by Gaston in the cellar, to stop them from\ninterfering with Gaston's goal to kill the Beast. Chip has managed to stow\naway in Belle's satchel and uses the automated firewood cutter to destroy the\ndoor to the cellar. Maurice and Belle leave for the castle to stop Gaston from\nkilling the Beast. He is last seen in the ballroom standing by Mrs. Potts as\nhe happily watches Belle and the Beast (who is now transformed back into a\nhandsome prince) dance while he laughs at Chip's question to his mother\nwhether he still has to 'stay in the cupboard'.\n\nIn the [2017 live-action remake](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2017_film\\)\n\"Beauty and the Beast \\(2017 film\\)\"), Maurice is played by Kevin Kline. He\nremains as an inventor, but makes music boxes to help Belle see the world from\nthe comfort of home in the village of Villeneuve. He fled [Paris](/wiki/Paris\n\"Paris\") and settled in the provinces with Belle when she was still a baby to\nprotect the both of them from a plague that took the life of Belle's mother\nand Maurice's wife. True to the original story, Maurice is imprisoned by the\nBeast for taking a rose from his garden instead of being caught trespassing in\nthe castle. Maurice returns to Villeneuve to find help, but only Gaston and\nLeFou are willing to do so. However, Gaston only wanted to help in order to\nget Maurice's blessing for his marriage to Belle. Knowing that Belle has no\ninterest in marrying Gaston, Maurice refuses her hand, prompting Gaston to\nleave him to die at the hands of the wolves. The Enchantress, disguised as a\nvillager named Agathe, rescues him and takes him back to Villeneuve. Upon his\nreturn, Maurice attempts to have Gaston arrested for attempted murder, but\nGaston in turn declares him insane and has him committed to an insane asylum.\nBelle arrives back in time to vindicate Maurice, but both are locked in the\nasylum wagon while the whole village goes to kill the Beast. After Maurice and\nBelle make amends regarding Belle now understanding why Maurice was so overly\nprotective of her, thanks to the Beast, Maurice uses his inventor skills to\npick the lock on the wagon, allowing Belle to take Phillipe back to the\nBeast's castle while Maurice remains behind with the dumbfounded Monsieur\nD'Arque. At the end of the movie, Maurice is seen painting the ballroom dance\nas everyone celebrates.\n\nHe only makes a cameo in _[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted\nChristmas](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast:_The_Enchanted_Christmas \"Beauty and the\nBeast: The Enchanted Christmas\")_ as one of the people listening to the story\nMrs. Potts is telling, and makes his debut appearance in the _[Kingdom\nHearts](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts \"Kingdom Hearts\")_ series in _[Kingdom Hearts\nχ](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_%CF%87 \"Kingdom Hearts χ\")_.\n\n### Lumière\n\nLumière  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Henri Lubatti](/wiki/Henri_Lubatti \"Henri Lubatti\") (_[Once\nUpon a Time](/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_\\(TV_series\\) \"Once Upon a Time \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_)  \n[Ewan McGregor](/wiki/Ewan_McGregor \"Ewan McGregor\") (live-action film)  \nVoiced by|  [Jerry Orbach](/wiki/Jerry_Orbach \"Jerry Orbach\") (films, [House\nof Mouse](/wiki/Disney%27s_House_of_Mouse \"Disney's House of Mouse\"))  \n[Jeff Bennett](/wiki/Jeff_Bennett \"Jeff Bennett\") (_[Kingdom Hearts\nII](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II \"Kingdom Hearts II\")_ , theme parks)  \n[Ewan McGregor](/wiki/Ewan_McGregor \"Ewan McGregor\") (live-action film)  \n[Masashi Ebara](/wiki/Masashi_Ebara \"Masashi Ebara\") (Japanese)  \n  \n**Lumière** is the Beast's kindhearted but rebellious [maître\nd'](/wiki/Ma%C3%AEtre_d%27h%C3%B4tel \"Maître d'hôtel\"), Cogsworth's\ncounterpart and rival. Because of the curse placed by the Enchantress, he was\ntransformed into a [candelabra](/wiki/Candelabra \"Candelabra\"). He allows\nMaurice to come into the castle to stay. Later, he and Cogsworth lure Belle to\nMaurice in hopes that she will break the spell. He suggests that Beast try and\nmove her to a better room. Lumière tries to help Beast become more civil for\nBelle, and sometimes rebels against the Beast if it suits the other\ncharacters' needs (like allowing Belle to have dinner despite Beast's refusal\nto let them feed her). Later, after the Beast rescues Belle from more wolves,\nand Belle nurses the beast back to health, earning his affections in the\nprocess, Lumière, aware of what would impress such a voracious reader,\nastutely suggests that the Beast give Belle the castle's immense library as a\ngift, which has the desired effect. He also tries to help the Beast learn how\nto do the waltz. He is initially upset that Belle leaves the castle, but he\nremains optimistic at the same time, since he's still convinced that she'll\nbreak the spell. When he discovers that the castle is going to be invaded by\nGaston's lynch mob, he plans the battle. He then decides to set up a trap\nwhere all of the furniture is in the foyer, and he gives the signal to attack.\nWhile he is unable to stop Gaston from deserting the battle to kill the Beast,\nLumière saves Fifi the Featherduster from being plucked apart by a villager\nand is earlier himself saved from Le Fou by Cogsworth. He, Cogsworth and Mrs.\nPotts rush to aid the Beast who is fighting against Gaston, but arrive after\nthe battle's end, when the Beast dies from a mortal wound from Gaston, who\nfell to his death from the West Wing. The spell breaks, however, reviving the\nBeast and returning Lumière and the others to their original forms. In the\nend, he gets into an argument with Cogsworth about who told who about Belle\nbreaking the spell (it was Lumière).\n\nIn _The Enchanted Christmas_ , he tries to help bring Christmas back into the\ncastle (even if it means disobeying his Master to do so). Also, he and\nCogsworth help get a Christmas tree with Belle upon Forte's suggestion\n(unaware of Forte's plan). When Forte decides to try to destroy the castle, he\nand Cogsworth try to save the rose.\n\nHe later appears in _[Kingdom Hearts II](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II \"Kingdom\nHearts II\")_ and _[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_358/2_Days\n\"Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\")_ as a supporting character in the Beast's Castle\nworld. In _358/2 Days_ , he and Cogsworth serve as the castle's patrol guards,\nforcing Roxas, Xion and Xaldin to evade their sight during missions in that\nworld, and in _Kingdom Hearts II_ , he is locked in the dungeon by the Beast\nalong with the other servants in an attempt to protect him by the Beast's\nrage, fueled by Xaldin, but he is freed by Sora, whom he helps by opening a\nsecret passage out of the undercroft. He later plays a small role in the final\nbattle against Xaldin.\n\nLumière is played by Scottish actor, Ewan McGregor in the live-action version\nof _Beauty and the Beast_. This depiction of Lumiere has him as a charismatic\n[bouteiller](/wiki/Grand_Butler_of_France \"Grand Butler of France\") who has\nbeen transformed into a human-shaped candelabra with a bronze human-like face,\narms tipped with candles and legs to walk with as well. Despite the\ndifferences, Lumiere's design as a candelabra with three branches still\nremains only by shape shifting and can be self litten. He is lover of Plumette\nwho has been transformed into a feather duster.\n\n### Cogsworth\n\nCogsworth  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Ian McKellen](/wiki/Ian_McKellen \"Ian McKellen\") (live-action\nfilm)  \nVoiced by|  [David Ogden Stiers](/wiki/David_Ogden_Stiers \"David Ogden\nStiers\") (film)  \n[Ian McKellen](/wiki/Ian_McKellen \"Ian McKellen\") (live-action film)  \n[Kazuo Kumakura](/wiki/Kazuo_Kumakura \"Kazuo Kumakura\") (Japanese)  \n  \n**Cogsworth** is the Beast's tightly wound and extremely loyal\n[Majordomo](/wiki/Majordomo \"Majordomo\"), and Lumière's counterpart and rival.\nWhen the Enchantress curses the Beast, he is transformed into a [pendulum\nclock](/wiki/Pendulum_clock \"Pendulum clock\"). He initially tries to stop the\nothers from allowing Maurice to stay at the castle (as he knows the Beast\nwould not approve), but ultimately gives in. When the Beast arrives, he tries\nto explain what happened, but the Beast is too angry to hear what happened. He\ntries to get Belle to come to dinner, but she refuses. When he reports to the\nBeast her refusal, he tries desperately to calm him down, as well as keep him\ncalm when trying to get her to join him for dinner. He follows the Beast's\norders to deny her dinner, but he eventually relents, telling them to at least\nkeep the noise down. He is eventually swept up in the boisterous \"Be Our\nGuest\" number. Later he learns that the Beast let Belle go, much to his\ndismay. He then tells everyone the bad news, and seems resigned to his fate\n(as the rose is nearing the last petal). When the residents of the castle\nlearn of the upcoming invasion, he tries to come up with a plan to stop the\nvillagers, but the others leave him before he can finish. He later\nparticipates in the battle and saves Lumiere from Le Fou by sliding down the\nbanister and prodding Le Fou's rear end with a pair of scissors. He, Lumiere\nand Mrs. Potts rush to aid the Beast who is fighting against Gaston, but\narrive after the battle's end, when the Beast dies from a mortal wound from\nGaston, who fell from the West Wing. The spell breaks, however, reviving the\nBeast and returning Cogsworth and the others to their original forms. In the\nend, he gets into an argument with Lumiere about who told who about Belle\nbreaking the spell (it was Lumiere).\n\nIn _The Enchanted Christmas_ , he is initially opposed to the idea of\nChristmas (mainly due to his master's opposition), but eventually decides that\nChristmas in the castle wouldn't be such a bad idea. He and Lumière try to\nhelp Belle find a Christmas tree under Forte's guidance, unaware of Forte's\nplans. Later, when Forte tries to destroy the castle, he attempts to save the\nrose.\n\nHe later appears in _Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days_ and _Kingdom Hearts II_ in\nhis homeworld, Beast's Castle. In theformer, he serves as a patrol guard in\nthe castle, and in the latter, he aids Sora in the brief fight against the\nBeast, under Xaldin's influence. He later plays a small role in the final\nbattle against Xaldin.\n\nCogsworth is played by Sir Ian McKellen in the live-action version of _Beauty\nand the Beast_. This version has a wife named Clothilde. In the ending, he is\nreunited with Clothilde after he transforms back into a human, much to his\ndismay. It is revealed that this version's first name is Henry.[1] The 2017\nlive-action version of Cogsworth is older than the 1991 animated version.\n\n### Mrs. Potts\n\nMrs. Potts  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Emma Thompson](/wiki/Emma_Thompson \"Emma Thompson\") (live-\naction film)  \nVoiced by|  [Angela Lansbury](/wiki/Angela_Lansbury \"Angela Lansbury\") (first\nand second films)  \n[Anne Rogers](/wiki/Anne_Rogers \"Anne Rogers\") (Belle's Magical World)  \n[Emma Thompson](/wiki/Emma_Thompson \"Emma Thompson\") (live-action film)  \n  \n**Mrs. Potts** is Chip's mother and the castle's head of the kitchen, and has\na loving, motherly feel. When the Enchantress curses [the\nBeast](/wiki/Beast_\\(Disney\\) \"Beast \\(Disney\\)\"), she is transformed into a\nteapot. In her first appearance, she helps Maurice get comfortable. She helps\ncomfort [Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\") when she is made to\nstay at the castle in exchange for her father's freedom. Mrs. Potts also tries\nto help the Beast try to become more civil to Belle, although the efforts fall\napart when Belle refuses to come to dinner. Later, Mrs. Potts entertains Belle\nwhen she's having dinner. When the Beast is wounded, she tries to tend to his\nwounds with Belle. After learning that there are invaders coming to the\ncastle, she tries to get the Beast to do something, but he declines, still\ndepressed about Belle leaving. She later participates in the battle of the\ncastle by having the rest of the dishes pour hot liquid on the villagers.\n\nIn _The Enchanted Christmas_ , she serves as the narrator of the tale. She\nlater appears in _Kingdom Hearts II_ in her homeworld, Beast's Castle. She\naids Sora, Lumiere and Cogsworth in opening the secret passage out of the\ndungeons by extinguishing the darkness surrounding the lanterns with the help\nof Sora's Keyblade.\n\nAngela Lansbury, who had been known for playing many \"despicable\" characters\nthroughout her Broadway career, noted that in the aftermath of her film role\nas Mrs Potts, children no longer hid behind their parents in fear when around\nher, and instead treated her like a heroine.[2]\n\nMrs. Potts is portrayed by Emma Thompson in the live-action version of _Beauty\nand the Beast_. During the final battle, she recognizes the potter Mr. Potts\namong the villagers storming the castle and is reunited with him after she\ntransforms back into a human. It is then revealed that her first name is\nBeatrice.\n\n### Chip Potts\n\nChip Potts  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Nathan Mack](/wiki/Nathan_Mack \"Nathan Mack\") (live-action\nfilm)  \nVoiced by|  [Bradley Pierce](/wiki/Bradley_Pierce \"Bradley Pierce\") (first\nfilm)  \n[Haley Joel Osment](/wiki/Haley_Joel_Osment \"Haley Joel Osment\") (second film)  \nGregory Grudt (Belle's Magical World)  \n[Tress MacNeille](/wiki/Tress_MacNeille \"Tress MacNeille\") (4 episodes of\n[House of Mouse](/wiki/Disney%27s_House_of_Mouse \"Disney's House of Mouse\"))  \n[Nikita Hopkins](/wiki/Nikita_Hopkins \"Nikita Hopkins\") (1 episode of [House\nof Mouse](/wiki/Disney%27s_House_of_Mouse \"Disney's House of Mouse\"))  \n[Nathan Mack](/wiki/Nathan_Mack \"Nathan Mack\") (live-action film)  \n  \n**Chip** is the son of Mrs. Potts. As a result of the Enchantress' spell, he\nis transformed into a teacup, with a small crack on the rim. He befriends\n[Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\") and looks up to her. He\ngets admonished by his mother when he does a bubble trick to Belle and when he\ngiggles at how [the Beast](/wiki/Beast_\\(Disney\\) \"Beast \\(Disney\\)\") handles\na spoon. Also, he stows away when she has to leave the castle to save her\nfather Maurice, and wants to find out why she left. He later frees Belle and\nMaurice, who are trapped in the cellar by Gaston, by commandeering Maurice's\ninvention, an automatic firewood chopper, to break open the cellar door but\ndestroying the invention in the process.\n\nIn _Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas_ , he is seen trying to open\npresents for Christmas. Also when Adam gives him a present, he's excited about\nit being a storybook. He helps Belle make a storybook to make the Beast feel\nbetter. Also, in the flashback depicting the Enchantress placing the spell on\nthe castle ten years earlier, he is present as a child, implying that the\nspell stopped him and the other servants from aging during the ten-year\nperiod.\n\nHe cameos in _Kingdom Hearts II_.\n\nIn the live-action version of _Beauty and the Beast_ , Chip is portrayed by\nNathan Mack. He is transformed into a teacup with a matching saucer, often\nusing the saucer to move around quickly (reminiscent of the droid\n[BB-8](/wiki/BB-8 \"BB-8\") from _[Star Wars: The Force\nAwakens](/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\")_).\nWhen the Enchantress's curse on the kingdom is not broken in time, Chip and\nall the other castle servants lose their last vestiges of humanity and become\ncompletely inanimate. Before Chip drops to the ground lifeless (his saucer\nalready shattering upon impact), his teacup form is saved at the last instant\nby an ailing Chapeau who is transformed into a lifeless coat rack. Shortly\nafterwards, the spell on the kingdom is broken and Chip along with the other\nservants are restored to their human forms. He and his mother are reunited\nwith Mr. Potts.\n\n### Featherduster\n\nThe Featherduster  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Gugu Mbatha-Raw](/wiki/Gugu_Mbatha-Raw \"Gugu Mbatha-Raw\")\n(live-action film)  \nVoiced by|  [Kimmy Robertson](/wiki/Kimmy_Robertson \"Kimmy Robertson\") (films,\n_House of Mouse_)  \n[Gugu Mbatha-Raw](/wiki/Gugu_Mbatha-Raw \"Gugu Mbatha-Raw\") (live-action film)  \nAliases|  Babette (musical, _House of Mouse_)  \nFifi (_Belle 's Magical World_)  \nMarie (_The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast_)  \nPlumette (live-action film)  \n  \n**The Featherduster** is a maid of the castle, who is also Lumière's\ngirlfriend.

He is apparently the [Yorkshire Terrier](/wiki/Yorkshire_Terrier\n\"Yorkshire Terrier\") of Madame Garderobe and Maestro Cadenza.\n\n### The Wardrobe\n\nWardrobe  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Audra McDonald](/wiki/Audra_McDonald \"Audra McDonald\") (live-\naction film)  \nVoiced by|  [Jo Anne Worley](/wiki/Jo_Anne_Worley \"Jo Anne Worley\")  \n[Audra McDonald](/wiki/Audra_McDonald \"Audra McDonald\") (live-action film)  \nAliases|  Amoire  \nGrande Bouche  \nGarderobe  \nTitle|  Madame  \n  \n**The Wardrobe** is a former opera singer, turned into a wardrobe. The\ncharacter of Wardrobe was introduced by visual development person Sue C.\nNichols to the then entirely male cast of servants, and was originally a more\nintegral character named \"Madame Armoire\". Her role was later expanded upon\nand ultimately taken over by Mrs. Potts.[3] Wardrobe is known as \"Madame de la\nGrande Bouche\" in the stage adaptation of the film. Her stage name supposedly\nmeans \"Mistress of the Big Mouth\" in a semi-literal English translation. The\nMarvel Comics serial for the movie, taking place during the movie, referred to\nher status as an opera singer that performed even to the king.\n\nShe later appears in _Kingdom Hearts II_ in her homeworld, Beast's Castle. In\nthe game, she blocks Sora's way to the undercroft to free the servants from\nthe dungeon, forcing Sora to push her out of the way while she is sleeping. As\nin the film, she is Belle's closest confidante in the castle after Lumiere.\n\nIn the [2017 live-action remake](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2017_film\\)\n\"Beauty and the Beast \\(2017 film\\)\"), the Wardrobe is portrayed by Audra\nMcDonald and is known as **Madame de Garderobe** , wife of court composer,\nMaestro Cadenza, and also a well-respected opera singer. The Enchantress'\ncurse separated her from her husband, and as the rose withered, she was prone\nto dozing off more often as she became more inanimate. After the Enchantress\nlifts the curse and restores everyone to human form, Garderobe is reunited\nwith her husband and sings at the celebratory ball at the end of the film.\n\n### Le Fou\n\nLe Fou  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Josh Gad](/wiki/Josh_Gad \"Josh Gad\") (live-action film)  \nVoiced by|  [Jesse Corti](/wiki/Jesse_Corti \"Jesse Corti\")  \n  \n**Le Fou** (French for \"The Madman\", and also a phonetic pun on \"The Fool\") is\na local villager who is Gaston's [bumbling-but-\nloyal](/wiki/Flying_monkeys_\\(psychology\\) \"Flying monkeys \\(psychology\\)\")\n[sidekick](/wiki/Sidekick \"Sidekick\") (and [punching bag](/wiki/Punching_bag\n\"Punching bag\")); he is often mistreated by Gaston, but he doesn't seem to\nmind. He seems unsure about Gaston marrying [Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\)\n\"Belle \\(Disney\\)\") (thinking that she and her father, Maurice, are \"crazy\"),\nbut helps him anyway. During the attempted wedding, he acts as a conductor to\nsignal the playing of a fast tempo version on \"[Here Comes the\nBride](/wiki/Bridal_Chorus \"Bridal Chorus\")\". Later, when Gaston comes up with\na plan to arrange for Maurice to be sent to the insane asylum to [force Belle\nto marry him](/wiki/Blackmail \"Blackmail\"), they head to Belle's house, but\nboth she and Maurice are gone. Gaston decides to have Le Fou [stay near the\nhouse and let him know when they return](/wiki/Ceremonial_Guard#Sentry_duty\n\"Ceremonial Guard\"), much to Le Fou's chagrin. After a while, when Belle\nbrings Maurice home, Le Fou alerts Gaston so he can put his plan into action.\nAfter learning that the Beast exists, he accompanies Gaston and the rest of\nthe lynch mob to the castle to kill the Beast singing \"The Mob Song\" with\neverybody. He picks up Lumière upon entering the castle, and Lumiere's signal\nbegins the battle. During the battle, Le Fou attempts to kill Lumiere by\nwaving a torch perilously close to Lumiere's head, but Cogsworth saves him by\njabbing scissors hard in Le Fou's rear end. He is last seen escaping with the\nrest of the villagers.\n\nIt is left unknown if he knew Gaston died against the Beast, though it's\npossible that Gaston's absence from then on gave him that message.\n\nIn the beginning of _The Enchanted Christmas_ , despite the rest of the\nvillagers being invited to the castle for a Christmas party, Le Fou is not\npresent.\n\nIn the movie, Le Fou was voiced by Venezuelan voice actor Jesse Corti, who\nalso voiced Le Fou in the Spanish-language dub of the film, making Le Fou one\nof the few characters to share the same voice actor in two different dubs of\nthe movie.\n\nIn the [2017 live-action adaptation](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2017_film\\)\n\"Beauty and the Beast \\(2017 film\\)\"), Le Fou is portrayed by [Josh\nGad](/wiki/Josh_Gad \"Josh Gad\"). In the version with Gad, the character is\ngay, becoming the first [homosexual](/wiki/Homosexuality \"Homosexuality\") in a\nDisney film.[4] In one deleted scene, Le Fou helped Gaston to break up the\nheadmaster leading the villagers into destroying Belle's laundry invention by\nshooting the gun in the air twice with the second time having a cow\naccidentally killed. Unlike in the original 1991 animated film during the\nfight at the Beast's castle, he saves Mrs. Potts when she falls from the\nchandelier and switches sides to helping the Beast's servants after Gaston\nabandons him while he takes a beating from the servants. One deleted scene had\nhim given a bad encounter with Monsieur Toilette which causes him to run out\nof the room he was in. In another deleted scene following the spell being\nbroken, Le Fou runs into Monsieur Toilette's true form which identified from\nthe bathroom smell. At the end of this version, he briefly dances with the\n(presumably gay) Stanley, who was also a friend and minion of Gaston's. In the\n2017 version, Le Fou is thus a rounder character, with complex motivations.\n\n### Monsieur D'Arque\n\nMonsieur D'Arque  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Adrian Schiller](/wiki/Adrian_Schiller \"Adrian Schiller\")\n(live-action film)  \nVoiced by|  [Tony Jay](/wiki/Tony_Jay \"Tony Jay\")  \n  \n**Monsieur D 'Arque** is the owner of the local madhouse or **Asylum for\nLoons**. Gaston bribes him to take part in a scheme to blackmail Belle into\nmarrying him in which D'Arque will threaten to have Belle's rather eccentric\nfather Maurice sent to the madhouse. After Belle returns from the Beast's\ncastle, Monsieur D'Arque appears to collect Maurice as Gaston, Le Fou, and\nmost of the villagers are present. He is only seen in these two scenes, and\nhis fate after the Beast's existence is revealed is left ambiguous.\n\nHe also appears in the 2017 version. He only appears after Gaston demands that\nMaurice be put into the asylum and also tries to lock up both Maurice and\nBelle on Gaston's orders while being told to make sure they don't get out.\nMonsieur D'Arque is dumbfounded when he discovers that the two had managed to\nescape. As Belle rides off, Maurice asks Monsieur D'Arque if he has children.\n\n### The Triplets\n\nClaudette, Laurette, and Paulette  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  Sophie Reid (Eliana)  \n[Rafaëlle Cohen](/wiki/Rafa%C3%ABlle_Cohen \"Rafaëlle Cohen\") (Elise)  \nCarla Nella (Eloïse)  \nVoiced by|  [Kath Soucie](/wiki/Kath_Soucie \"Kath Soucie\") (Paulette [1991\nfilm]; all characters [subsequent appearances])  \n[Mary Kay Bergman](/wiki/Mary_Kay_Bergman \"Mary Kay Bergman\") (Claudette and\nLaurette [1991 film])  \n  \n**The Triplets** , also known as the \"Bimbettes\", are a trio of beautiful\nblonde women who fawn over Gaston. The real names of the girls are\n**Claudette** , who wears a red dress, **Laurette** , who wears yellow dress,\nand **Paulette** , who wears a green dress. They think\n[Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\") is crazy when they see her\nrefusing Gaston's advances. They are also upset when Gaston decides to marry\nBelle, as they are seen crying when he is announcing that he will propose to\nBelle. They are later seen comforting and fawning over Gaston in the bar. They\nare not part of the mob who tries to kill [the Beast](/wiki/Beast_\\(Disney\\)\n\"Beast \\(Disney\\)\"). The end of the Gaston song implies that they acted as\n[waitresses](/wiki/Waiting_staff \"Waiting staff\") in the tavern due to\nPaulette being seen with a silver platter.\n\nIn the beginning of \"The Enchanted Christmas,\" despite the rest of the\nvillagers being invited to the castle for a Christmas party, the Triplets\naren't present.\n\nThe triplets also appear in the Marvel Comics serial for Beauty and the Beast,\nwhich was set during Belle's stay at the castle. They are generally within the\nB-stories, where they try to sabotage Gaston's plans to marry Belle, with\nvarying success.\n\nIn the Musical, their roles are the same, although they are given more\ndialogue and their role is expanded slightly.\n\nThey have made regular appearances on \"[Disney's House of\nMouse](/wiki/Disney%27s_House_of_Mouse \"Disney's House of Mouse\").\" They are\nnow all voiced by Kath Soucie (who had originally just voiced Paulette), due\nto [Mary Kay Bergman](/wiki/Mary_Kay_Bergman \"Mary Kay Bergman\")'s suicide by\nthe time the show was made.\n\nThey also appear in the [2017 live-action\nremake](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2017_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(2017\nfilm\\)\"). Although their overall roles were the same, they are in fact among\nthe mob late in the film unlike in the 1991 original. In addition, the\ntriplets were given a significantly different appearance, where they wore\nsimilarly-colored pink dresses, and possessed heavy makeup, a beauty spot, and\nbrunette hair, as well as explicitly disliking Belle (Bill Condon and Rafaëlle\nCohen both indicated the triplets' dislike of Belle dealt with their own mom\nneglecting them and doting on the latter). They are also depicted as being\nmore haughty and vain. Their occupations also changed, acting as\n[seamstresses](/wiki/Dressmaker \"Dressmaker\") in the remake. The three of them\nare among the villagers that accompany Gaston to the Beast's castle to kill\nthe Beast where they end up fighting the servants. One deleted scene had the\nTriplets chasing Frou-Frou into the kitchen where Cuisiner throws food on\nthem. It is left unknown if they knew Gaston died against the Beast, though\nit's possible that Gaston's absence from then on gave them that message.\nLastly, they were also given significantly different names by their actresses,\nbeing Elise (portrayed by Rafaëlle Cohen), Eliana (portrayed by Sophie Reid),\nand Eloïse (portrayed by Carla Nella), though the names have not currently\nbeen officiated.\n\n### The Baker\n\nThe Baker  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  Dale Branston  \nVoiced by|  Alec Murphy  \n  \nThe **Baker** is the head of a bakery in the village that Belle lived in. He\nsays good morning to Belle and asks where Belle is off to. When Belle states\nthat she is on her way to the bookstore to return a book about a beanstalk and\nan ogre, the Baker quotes \"That's nice\" and shouts into the bakery for Marie\nto hurry up with the baguettes. The Baker later provides the birthday cake for\nGaston's wedding proposal for Belle which doesn't go well. After Belle\nreturned from the Beast's castle, the Baker is among the villagers gathered by\nGaston at the time when Gaston as Monsieur D'Arque comes to collect Maurice.\nAfter Belle uses the Beast's mirror to show that the Beast exists, the Baker\nis among the villagers that accompany Gaston and Le Fou to the Beast's Castle\nto kill the Beast only for the villagers to be fended off by the transformed\nservants.\n\nIn the live-action film, Belle is seen during the first song buying one of the\nBaker's foods and his discussion to Belle was transferred to Jean Potts. The\nBaker was seen when the Headmaster had roused the villagers into destroying\nBelle's laundry invention after the Headmaster caught Belle teaching a girl\nhow to read. Like the animated film, the Baker is among the villagers that\naccompany Gaston and Le Fou to the Beast's castle to kill the Beast only for\nthe villagers to be fended off by the transformed servants.\n\n### The Bookseller\n\nThe Bookseller  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Ray Fearon](/wiki/Ray_Fearon \"Ray Fearon\") (live-action film)  \nVoiced by|  Alvin Epstein  \n  \nThe **Bookseller** is the owner of a small bookstore/library in the village\nthat Belle lived in. He is one of a few villagers that are friendly to Belle.\nWhen Belle visits his place of work, the Bookseller states that he hasn't\nreceived any new books yet. He does allow Belle to keep the book that she has\nborrowed twice.\n\nIn the live-action film, the Bookseller is replaced with **Père Robert** who\nis Villeneuve's local chaplain. He encourages Belle to borrow the books in the\nchapel's meager library. He later helps Belle pick up some laundry when the\ncruel headmaster had some villagers throw them on the street after he\ndiscovered her trying to teach a young girl how to read. When Gaston has\nMonsieur D'Arque take Maurice to the Asylum after being accused for leaving\nhim for dead, Père Robert insists that Maurice isn't insane and suggests that\nhe be brought to a hospital. As Gaston leads the villagers to the Beast's\ncastle with an intention to kill the Beast, Père Robert watched in horror as\nvillagers furiously marched toward their destination while he defiantly\nremains behind and shuns himself from participating. After the spell that was\ncast by the Enchantress was broken, Père Robert was among those seen attending\nthe ball.\n\n### The Enchantress\n\nThe Enchantress  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  [Hattie Morahan](/wiki/Hattie_Morahan \"Hattie Morahan\") (live-\naction film)  \nVoiced by|  [Kath Soucie](/wiki/Kath_Soucie \"Kath Soucie\") (second film)  \n  \n**The[Enchantress](/wiki/Magician_\\(fantasy\\) \"Magician \\(fantasy\\)\")** is an\noff-screen, minor character, but she is responsible for the events in the\nstory, as revealed in the prologue that it is she who curses Prince Adam as\n[the Beast](/wiki/Beast_\\(Disney\\) \"Beast \\(Disney\\)\"). She pays a visit to\nthe castle one cold winter night and poses as an ugly, old peddler woman,\noffering a single rose for shelter. After being turned away by the prince\ntwice, she reveals her true self (young and beautiful, yet cruel and\nhypocritical) and punishes him by transforming him into the Beast, his\nservants into objects, and his castle into a horrific version of itself laden\nwith ugly gargoyles and grotesque statues. The Enchantress left the Beast with\nonly two items, a magic mirror as the only window to the outside world, and\nthe rose she had tried to give him. It turns out the rose is enchanted,\nworking as an hourglass: it will bloom until his 21st birthday, when its\npetals will begin to fall. When the last petal falls, the prince will remain a\nBeast forever. The spell can only be broken if he can learn to love and\nreceives love in return. Her spell is broken at the last second by\n[Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\")'s confession of love for\nthe Beast.\n\nIn _The Enchanted Christmas_ , it is revealed that the Enchantress' visit that\nresulted in the curse occurred on Christmas Day, which resulted in Adam's\ndislike for the holiday. The Enchantress is voiced by [Kath\nSoucie](/wiki/Kath_Soucie \"Kath Soucie\") in the flashback scene of the film.\n\nIn the live-action version, the Enchantress is played by [Hattie\nMorahan](/wiki/Hattie_Morahan \"Hattie Morahan\"), who also serves as the\nnarrator of the prologue. She came to a debutante ball disguised as a beggar\nwoman (portrayed by Rita Davies) and offered a rose as payment for shelter\nfrom the storm. The Prince turned her away twice, prompting her to reveal her\ntrue self. She not only transformed the prince, his servants, and the castle,\nbut erased the villagers' memory of the prince. Years later, she reappeared\ndisguised as a hermit named Agathe. A deleted scene during the \"Belle\" song\nhad Belle giving bread and jam to Agathe. She later tended to Maurice when\nGaston left him for dead for the latter's refusal to hand Belle in marriage.\nLater, she came to the Beast's chamber while the Beast lay near death and\noverheard Belle profess her love for him despite it already being too late, as\nthe last petal on the rose had fallen. She turned the rose into enchanted dust\nwhich revived the Beast and transformed both him and his servants into humans\nonce again.\n\n### Phillipe\n\nPhillipe  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  Rusty (live-action film)  \nVoiced by|  [Hal Smith](/wiki/Hal_Smith_\\(actor\\) \"Hal Smith \\(actor\\)\")\n(original film)  \n[Frank Welker](/wiki/Frank_Welker \"Frank Welker\") (sequel)  \n  \n**Phillipe** is a [Belgian horse](/wiki/Belgian_horse \"Belgian horse\") owned\nby [Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\") and Maurice.

He\nwas disappointed that Beast cancelled dinner and he felt he had to throw away\nwhat he had made until Belle finally informed him, Lumière, Cogsworth and Mrs.\nPotts that she was hungry. When the villagers attacked the castle, he and the\nknives ended up scaring away the villagers that chased Sultan into the\nkitchen.\n\nIn the \"Belle's Magical World\" segment \"Mrs. Potts' Party,\" Chef Bouche is\ninstructed by Belle to bake a cake for Mrs. Potts. Even though he ran into\ndifficulty, Chef Bouche succeeded in making the cake as he and the kitchen\nstaff help Belle present it to Mrs. Potts.\n\nIn the live-action film, Chef Bouche was renamed **Cuisiner**. In addition to\nbeing changed into a stove, he also consists of various pots, pans, and other\nkitchen utensils as facial features and body parts. Cuisiner is shown\npreparing a dinner for Belle on Lumiere's orders without the Beast finding\nout. A deleted scene has Cuisiner taking part in the battle against the\nvillagers where he throws molasses and feathers all over the Triplets that\nchased Frou Frou into the kitchen. In the same deleted scene where Le Fou had\nfinished talking with Monsieur Toilette, Cuisiner is shown hugging a villager\nthat he knows as Monsieur Toilette passes them. When the villager reacts to\nthe hotness as a side effect of Cuisiner having been a stove, Cuisiner\napologizes to the villager. The villager gives him a forgiveness gesture.\n\n### Coat Rack\n\nCoat Rack  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \nPortrayed by|  Thomas Padden (live-action film)  \n  \nThe **Coat Rack** is an unnamed servant of the Beast who was turned into a\n[coat rack](/wiki/Coat_rack \"Coat rack\") that sports a green hat.\n\nHe was first seen amongst the castle's inhabitants welcoming Maurice and\ngiving him a blanket to help him warm up. The Coat Rack was seen helping Beast\nget ready for his dance with Belle. When Gaston leads the villagers into\nraiding the castle, the Coat Rack is among the servants seen fighting the\nvillagers where he boxes with one of the villagers.\n\nIn the live-action film, the Coat Rack has a larger role and is named\n**Chapeau**. He served as the Prince's aide (the junior novelization listed\nhim as a valet) who was turned into a coat rack. When Maurice first enters the\ncastle, he hands his coat on him. After Belle was frightened out of the West\nWing by Beast, Chapeau tries to prevent Belle from leaving the castle.\nChappeau later takes part in the fight against the villagers where he punches\nLe Fou. As the last petal falls, Chapeau catches Chip before being rendered\ninanimate like everyone else. After the spell is broken, Chapeau is restored\nto normal as he pulls his foot away from Frou-Frou who was urinating on it.\n\n### Palanquin\n\nPalanquin  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(1991\nfilm\\)\")_ (1991)  \n  \n**Palanquin** is an unidentified servant transformed into a\n[palanquin](/wiki/Litter_\\(vehicle\\) \"Litter \\(vehicle\\)\") that resides at the\nBeast's castle.

Beat then order\nPalanquin to drop Maurice back at the village. Palanquin did tha after ripping\nit's bindings off.\n\nIn _The New Adventures of Disney 's Beauty and the Beast_ comics, Mrs. Potts\nand Sultan enlist Palanquin to help rescue Beast and Chip when they fell off\nthe castle into the ravine.\n\n## Introduced in _Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas_\n\n### Forte\n\nForte  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted\nChristmas](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast:_The_Enchanted_Christmas \"Beauty and the\nBeast: The Enchanted Christmas\")_ (1997)  \nVoiced by|  [Tim Curry](/wiki/Tim_Curry \"Tim Curry\")  \n  \n**Forte** is the composer of the castle and serves as the main antagonist of\n_The Enchanted Christmas_. When the Enchantress curses [the\nBeast](/wiki/Beast_\\(Disney\\) \"Beast \\(Disney\\)\"), he is transformed into a\n[pipe organ](/wiki/Pipe_organ \"Pipe organ\"). Unlike the other cursed denizens,\nhe enjoys the new form that he has for its power, as he feels that he's more\nuseful to the Beast in this form than as his human form. As such, he intends\nto sabotage the Beast and [Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\")'s\nrelationship to ensure that the spell is never broken. He also uses Fife the\n[Piccolo](/wiki/Piccolo \"Piccolo\") to carry out his plan, promising him his\nown musical solo when he succeeds (though he never actually intends to give\nthe solo to him). He tries to lure Belle away from the castle to get a\nChristmas tree in an area beyond a frozen lake. While she's away, Forte tells\nthe Beast that Belle has abandoned him, thus fueling more anger into the\nBeast. He then proceeds to tell the Beast to destroy the Enchanted Rose, but\nthe Beast ultimately decides not to when a rose petal lands on the storybook\nfrom Belle, thus allowing the Beast to regain his senses.\n\nEnraged at this failure, and refusing to \"fade away\", he decides to destroy\nthe entire castle with his music, as the Beast and Belle can't fall in love if\nthey are both dead. He ultimately meets his end when the Beast rips out his\nkeyboard and wrecks it, causing Forte to try to kill the Beast by lunging at\nhim. He ends up being dislodged from the wall causing Forte to crash to the\nground.\n\n**NOTE** : When _The Enchanted Christmas_ was originally conceived as a direct\nsequel to the first film, the character of Forte was written as Avenant,\nGaston's vengeful younger brother who would also be determined to ruin Belle\nand Adam's lives before meeting his own end. Though plans for the sequel were\nscrapped, many of Avenant's characteristics were integrated into Forte.\n\n### Fife\n\nFife  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted\nChristmas](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast:_The_Enchanted_Christmas \"Beauty and the\nBeast: The Enchanted Christmas\")_ (1997)  \nVoiced by|  [Paul Reubens](/wiki/Paul_Reubens \"Paul Reubens\")  \n  \n**Fife** is a resident of the castle. When the Enchantress curses [the\nBeast](/wiki/Beast_\\(Disney\\) \"Beast \\(Disney\\)\"), he is transformed into a\n[piccolo](/wiki/Piccolo \"Piccolo\"). He is tricked by Forte into trying to\nsabotage the relationship under the promise of his own solo. Fife lures\n[Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\") into Forte's room for him\nto tell Belle where a suitable [Christmas tree](/wiki/Christmas_tree\n\"Christmas tree\") is located. However, shortly after she leaves, Forte tells\nFife to follow her to the tree (presumably so he can cause the ice to break\nwith his sound). Fife later regrets this action and decides to help Belle and\nBeast mend their relationship. Forte decides to destroy the castle and Fife\ntries to stop him. Forte reveals that he never intended to give him a musical\nsolo (via expelling blank note sheets). No longer loyal to Forte, Fife tells\nthe Beast that Forte's power comes from the keyboard and Beast uses this\nknowledge to depower him. In the ending of the movie (taking place in the\npresent), Fife seems to have taken over Forte's job as the composer of the\ncastle.\n\n### Angelique\n\nAngelique  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted\nChristmas](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast:_The_Enchanted_Christmas \"Beauty and the\nBeast: The Enchanted Christmas\")_ (1997)  \nVoiced by|  [Bernadette Peters](/wiki/Bernadette_Peters \"Bernadette Peters\")  \n  \n**Angelica** is the castle decorator. When the Enchantress curses [the\nBeast](/wiki/Beast_\\(Disney\\) \"Beast \\(Disney\\)\"), she transforms into a\nChristmas angel [ornament](/wiki/Decorative_arts \"Decorative arts\"). She\ninitially opposes the idea of Christmas, but then reconsiders after Belle\ntells her the joys of Christmas. She later comforts Belle in the dungeon.\n\n## Introduced in _Belle 's Magical World_\n\n### Webster\n\nWebster  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Belle's Magical World](/wiki/Belle%27s_Magical_World\n\"Belle's Magical World\")_ (1998)  \nVoiced by|  [Jim Cummings](/wiki/Jim_Cummings \"Jim Cummings\")  \n  \n**Webster** is the castle's [scribe](/wiki/Scribe \"Scribe\") who was\ntransformed into a dictionary by the Enchantress' spell. While he means well,\nhe has a rather long tongue, often speaking out of the right moment. This\nleads to the other servants, particularly Lumiere and Cogsworth, to dislike\nhim greatly.

In contrast, he is an intelligent [pigeon](/wiki/Columbidae\n\"Columbidae\") in charge of delivering the Beast's messages to the village for\nplacing orders or anything similar. While it is possible that he was already a\npigeon before the Enchantress placed the spell on the castle, his previously\nbeing a human servant may be the only possible explanation of his capability\nof understanding English with no apparent problem.\n\n## Introduced in the live-action film\n\n### Maestro Cadenza\n\nMaestro Cadenza  \n---  \nFirst appearance|  _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2017_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(2017\nfilm\\)\")_ (2017)  \nPortrayed by|  [Stanley Tucci](/wiki/Stanley_Tucci \"Stanley Tucci\") (live-\naction film)  \nVoiced by|  [Stanley Tucci](/wiki/Stanley_Tucci \"Stanley Tucci\")  \n  \nExclusive to the 2017 live-action film, **Maestro Cadenza** is the husband to\nthe opera singer Madame de Garderobe and is the castle's court composer.
