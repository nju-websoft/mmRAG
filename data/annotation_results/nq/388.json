In this episode, The _Enterprise_ rescues a\n[Starfleet](/wiki/Starfleet \"Starfleet\") admiral's grandson, long thought\ndead, but who had been adopted and raised by the enemies who killed the boy's\nparents.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Future _Deep Space Nine_ episode similarities\n  * 3 Reviews\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Plot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Suddenly_Human&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Plot\")]\n\nThe _[Enterprise](/wiki/USS_Enterprise_\\(NCC-1701-D\\) \"USS Enterprise\n\\(NCC-1701-D\\)\")_ responds to a distress call from a Talarian vessel. They\nrescue five teenaged members, four of whom are Talarian, and one human, Jono\n([Chad Allen](/wiki/Chad_Allen_\\(actor\\) \"Chad Allen \\(actor\\)\")).\n\nJono keeps to himself, but shows strict obedience to [Captain\nPicard](/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard \"Jean-Luc Picard\"), which together with some\nunexplained past injuries leads [Doctor Crusher](/wiki/Beverly_Crusher\n\"Beverly Crusher\") to suggest Jono may have been physically abused. It is\ndetermined that Jono is Jeremiah Rossa, a long-lost\n[Federation](/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets \"United Federation of\nPlanets\") citizen. His grandmother is a [Starfleet](/wiki/Starfleet\n\"Starfleet\") [admiral](/wiki/Admiral \"Admiral\"), and he was orphaned ten years\nago when his parents were killed in a skirmish with the Talarians.\n\nWhen the Captain introduces the topic of Jono's human family, Jono gets angry.\nAfter persistent effort by Picard, Jono's memories of the attack begin to\nreturn and a friendship develops between Jono and [Wesley\nCrusher](/wiki/Wesley_Crusher \"Wesley Crusher\").\n\nA Talarian ship arrives, and its Captain, Endar, asks for a status on his son,\nJono. Ten years ago, Endar claimed Jono after Jono's parents were killed. This\nis part of the Talarian custom of adopting the children of slain enemies to\nreplace their children who have died in battle. Endar explains Jono's injuries\nas the products of a boy trying to impress his father by participating in\nhigh-risk activities; Picard seems satisfied and observes that Endar seems to\ncare for Jono. Picard allows Endar to see Jono, but when Jono says he wants to\nstay with Endar, Picard suspects the boy is afraid to say he wants to stay in\nthe Federation. Endar insists that Jono will come back with him, even if the\nresult is war between the Talarians and the Federation.\n\nReturning to his vessel, Endar calls for reinforcements, as Picard decides to\ntry to convince Jono to stay. After Jono receives a message from his\ngrandmother, Picard takes the boy to play a form of racquetball, where Jono\nbreaks down and cries. The crew believes they are making progress with the\nboy, but that night, Jono stabs the Captain. The dagger is deflected by\nPicard's [sternum](/wiki/Sternum \"Sternum\"), and the wound is minor. The\nproblem of where Jono should live is now compounded as Jono has committed a\nFederation crime.\n\nWhen Picard learns that Jono feels he cannot betray Endar by befriending\nPicard, the Captain realizes he has been trying to impose his wishes on the\nboy. Just as Endar's patience is about to run out, Picard contacts the\nTalarians and lets them know he will let Jono go back. Jono bids Picard\nfarewell with a Talarian ritual that is normally reserved for family members.\n\n## Future _Deep Space Nine_ episode\nsimilarities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Suddenly_Human&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Future Deep Space Nine episode similarities\")]\n\n_Suddenly Human_ , which aired in 1990, has strong similarities to the second\nseason _[DS9](/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\")_\nepisode, _[Cardassians](/wiki/Cardassians_\\(Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine\\)\n\"Cardassians \\(Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\\)\")_ , which aired in 1993. In both\n_Suddenly Human_ and _Cardassians_ , a young male alien is living with a\nfamily of another species, who adopt him after the conclusion of a battle or\nwar. In both episodes, the adopting family insists on the return of the child,\nwhile the biological family also fights for custody. Tensions rise as the\nquestion of custody is decided. In both episodes, custody is decided by the\ncommanding officers present.\n\nHowever, the episodes have different conclusions. In _Suddenly Human_ ,\n[Captain Picard](/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard \"Jean-Luc Picard\") returns the young\nman Jono/Jeremiah Rossa to his adopting father because the young man is old\nenough to decide for himself with whom he wishes to live, and because it is\nthe only life he has ever known. In _Cardassians_ , Commander [Benjamin\nSisko](/wiki/Benjamin_Sisko \"Benjamin Sisko\") removes the child from his\ncaring Bajoran foster family when it is revealed that he was placed in foster\ncare under false pretenses by another Cardassian.\n\n## Reviews[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Suddenly_Human&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Reviews\")]\n\nJamahl Epsicokhan of [TrekNation](/wiki/TrekNation \"TrekNation\")'s Jammer's\nReviews, pointed out that this was the third TNG episode in a row to deal with\nfamily issues. Epsicokhan called _Suddenly Human_ the least effective of the\nthree family-oriented episodes, stating that the plot took too long to play\nout, that the storyline was flat in parts, and criticized the script. The\nreviewer was also disappointed that the Starfleet admiral's reaction to her\nrequest for custody being disregarded by Picard was left as an unresolved plot\npoint.[1]\n\nAs of March 22, 2017, _Suddenly Human_ has an average viewer rating of 6.5 out\nof 10 stars, on the [IMDb](/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database \"Internet Movie\nDatabase\").[2]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Suddenly_Human&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Epsicokhan, Jamahl.
