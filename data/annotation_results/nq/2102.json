When it is time to announce her name we will do it. Or his\nname. Or their names.\"[7] The NFL confirmed the announcement on October 22\nwith a video starring Timberlake and [Jimmy Fallon](/wiki/Jimmy_Fallon \"Jimmy\nFallon\").[8]\n\nThis was Timberlake's third appearance in a Super Bowl halftime show. As a\nmember of [NSYNC](/wiki/NSYNC \"NSYNC\"), Timberlake appeared in the [Super Bowl\nXXXV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXV \"Super Bowl XXXV\") (2001) halftime show, and as a\nguest artist in the [Super Bowl XXXVIII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII \"Super Bowl\nXXXVIII\") (2004), which performance featured a [controversial\nincident](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy \"Super Bowl\nXXXVIII halftime show controversy\") where Timberlake accidentally exposed one\nof [Janet Jackson](/wiki/Janet_Jackson \"Janet Jackson\")'s\n[breasts](/wiki/Breast \"Breast\") on national television, described as a\n[wardrobe malfunction](/wiki/Wardrobe_malfunction \"Wardrobe malfunction\").

Also part of the look is a [Prince of Wales-\ncheck](/wiki/Glen_plaid \"Glen plaid\") and camouflage splatter-print suit and\nmatching jacket. As usual for McCartney, these pieces were made from animal-\nfree leather and organic cotton.[11][12]\n\nTimberlake stated in a press conference that there would be no guest musicians\nin the halftime show and that the event would focus solely on himself and his\nbacking band, the Tennessee Kids.[13] Regarding the\n[Prince](/wiki/Prince_\\(entertainer\\) \"Prince \\(entertainer\\)\") tribute, the\nperformance's creative visual lead, Fireplay's Nick Whitehouse, told _[Rolling\nStone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ :\n\n> Paying tribute to Prince was something JT highlighted as an important moment\n> for this show, and we spent quite a bit of time ensuring this moment would\n> be true to his legacy. Ultimately, Justin decided that the only person who\n> could do Prince justice is Prince. The band held 50-hours worth of\n> rehearsals in preparation for the show.[14]\n\nPrince had previously stated he did not want to be included in new music after\ndeath in a 1998 interview, citing [The Beatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The\nBeatles\")' \"[Free as a Bird](/wiki/Free_as_a_Bird \"Free as a Bird\")\" as an\nexample of a practice he considered to be \"demonic.\" His family granted\npermission to use Prince's likeness on the condition that it not be used in a\n[hologram](/wiki/Hologram \"Hologram\"), and they approved of the final\nresult.[15][2] [Sheila E](/wiki/Sheila_E \"Sheila E\"), a former bandmate of\nPrince's who was involved in negotiations over the use of his likeness, stated\nthat \"a bigger company\" (she declined to specify whether it was Pepsi or the\nNFL) had insisted on including the Prince apparition and that the notion was\nnot originally Timberlake's idea.[16]\n\nDespite the lack of an individual guest artist, the more than 300-member\n[University of Minnesota Marching\nBand](/wiki/University_of_Minnesota_Marching_Band \"University of Minnesota\nMarching Band\") was featured in the show. The band's drumline, brass, and\nsaxophone sections pre-recorded and performed with Timberlake during his\nperformance of \"Suit & Tie.\" The upper woodwind and auxiliary sections led\ndrill formations and held large mirrors during Timberlake’s performance of his\nsong \"Mirrors\", and acted as fans and dancers throughout other portions of the\nshow, including the club scene at the show's opening. All members of the band\nwere featured on the field in the show's finale, \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\".\nThe band had previously performed in the halftime show of [Super Bowl\nXXVI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXVI \"Super Bowl XXVI\").[4]\n\n## Critical\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_LII_halftime_show&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Critical response\")]\n\nTimberlake’s performance received mixed reviews.[17] In a positive review,\nBruce R. Miller of _[Sioux City Journal](/wiki/Sioux_City_Journal \"Sioux City\nJournal\")_ wrote \"Timberlake is a masterful live performer – which made\nSunday's Super Bowl performance about the only sure bet,\" he continued\ncommenting the performer \"did a lot of infectious dancing and managed to play\nwith the crowd like no other.\" Although it did not have a moment that \"stuck,\"\nhe considered the Prince tribute the best moment of the show.[18] In a\nsimilarly positive review, Taylor Weatherby of\n_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_ said\n\"there is no denying that Timberlake absolutely rocked his first headlining\n[halftime]\", further adding \"Timberlake's halftime show was undeniably\nmesmerizing. From starting in the concourse to making his way into the crowd\n(and making #SelfieKid an instant superstar) for the ending.\" She also\nconsidered it \"is made for a TV experience\" rather than for the public in the\nstadium, mainly for the sound quality difficulties, but also criticized him\nfor including Rock Your Body in the set list.[19] From the same magazine, Nina\nBraca wrote \"his moves were on point,\"[17] and Andrew Ubterberger said two\nthings were \"relatively certain\" about the performance. \"most of America would\nlove it, and most of the Internet would hate it,\" and added Timberlake was \"in\na situation that was both a can't-lose and a can't-win. It would've been\nvirtually impossible for him to please the critics he'd alienated over the\nlast couple years.\"[20] Also from Billboard, Andrew Unterberge wrote,\n\"Timberlake's audio was somewhat lacking throughout...but the choreography,\nlive-band energy and song selection were all pretty impeccable\".[21]\n\nChris Willman of _[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ stated that, \"Timberlake turned in a more enjoyably physical\nperformance than just about anybody else who's done the Bowl show… and if it\nwas more a feat of athleticism than aestheticism, you can’t say that’s\nentirely inappropriate for the occasion.\"[22] Willman also wrote that the\nshow, \"wasn't one for the ages, but was impressive as a show of\nathleticism\"[22]\n\nJon Caramanica of _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York\nTimes\")_ wrote that Timberlake's performance was, \"heavy on dance spectacle,\nlight on vocal authority\".[23] Daniel Fienberg of _[The Hollywood\nReporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_ called the\nshow, \"energetic, but also entirely lacking in live excitement.\" Feinberg\ncriticized the show for largely lacking spontaneity and live vocals. Feinberg\nwrote that Timberlake delivered, \"one of the most over-planned, least\nsurprising performances imaginable.\"[24] Darren Franich of [Entertainment\nWeekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\") graded Timberlake's\nperformance a \"C\", calling it, \"dutiful, and empty\". Franich faulted\nTimberlake for playing too safe with his performance.[25] Similarly, Fran Guan\nof [Vulture.com](/wiki/Vulture.com \"Vulture.com\") wrote, \"Technically\nspeaking, Timberlake’s set was a testament to precision\". Guan, however,\ncriticized Timberlake's performance from lacking in personality, and regarded\nhis performance as unmemorable.[26]\n\n_[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_ gave Timberlake 3 out of 5\nstars, calling his performance forgettable but flashy.[27] In an interview\nwith NPR, Ann Powers said that \"the entire performance was shrouded in the\nsense of Timberlake not being right for this moment — and the Janet Jackson\ncontroversy haunted it.\"[28] Daniel D’Addarrio of\n[Time.com](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\") gave the performance a\nnegative review, criticizing Timberlake for singing Cry Me A River in addition\nto Rock Your Body, calling the song’s lyrics about an evil promiscuous woman\nout of step with the national mood, and said that the only message from\nTimberlake’s performance was that he loves his back catalog[29]\n_[Deadline](/wiki/Deadline_\\(magazine\\) \"Deadline \\(magazine\\)\")_ felt \"but\nyou could see the motions more than you felt the music.\"[30] Chris Richards of\n_[The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_\nregarded Timberlake’s performance as, “unambiguously underwhelming”.[31]\n\n_USA Today_ and _Vulture_ compared Timberlake's performance unfavorably to\nPrince's own [2007 halftime show](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLI#Halftime_show \"Super\nBowl XLI\").[32][26] Amanda Petrusich of _[The New Yorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker\n\"The New Yorker\")_ wrote that Timberlake’s decision to omit the end of \"Rock\nYour Body\" (which was performed during the controversial 2004 halftime) felt,\n“less like an apology than yet more spineless deflection”.[33] However, Andrew\nUnterberge of Billboard considered Timberlake's decision to cut the song short\nto be wise.[21] Timberlake's Stella McCartney-designed outfit received\nnegative reviews, with some critics regarding it as \"tacky\".[17][24][19][21]\nThe LA Times also gave a very critical review, one which also stated that\nTimberlake had nothing to say in his performance, and said that it lacked soul\nand meaning.[34] The Digital Journal gave him 2/5 stars and called it\nlackluster.[35]\n\n## Commercial\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl_LII_halftime_show&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Commercial reception\")]\n\nThe Super Bowl LII halftime show was seen by 106.6 million television viewers\nin the United States, 9% less than [Lady Gaga's in\n2017](/wiki/Super_Bowl_LI_halftime_show \"Super Bowl LI halftime show\").
