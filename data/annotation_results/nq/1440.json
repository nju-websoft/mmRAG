During\nfermentation, [yeasts](/wiki/Yeast \"Yeast\") transform [sugars](/wiki/Sugar\n\"Sugar\") present in the juice into [ethanol](/wiki/Ethanol \"Ethanol\") and\n[carbon dioxide](/wiki/Carbon_dioxide \"Carbon dioxide\") (as a [by-\nproduct](/wiki/By-product \"By-product\")). In winemaking, the\n[temperature](/wiki/Temperature \"Temperature\") and speed of fermentation are\nimportant considerations as well as the levels of [oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen\n\"Oxygen\") present in the [must](/wiki/Must \"Must\") at the start of the\nfermentation. The risk of [stuck fermentation](/wiki/Stuck_fermentation \"Stuck\nfermentation\") and the development of several [wine faults](/wiki/Wine_fault\n\"Wine fault\") can also occur during this stage, which can last anywhere from 5\nto 14 days for _primary fermentation_ and potentially another 5 to 10 days for\na _[secondary fermentation](/wiki/Secondary_fermentation_\\(wine\\) \"Secondary\nfermentation \\(wine\\)\")_. Fermentation may be done in stainless steel tanks,\nwhich is common with many white wines like [Riesling](/wiki/Riesling\n\"Riesling\"), in an open wooden vat, inside a [wine barrel](/wiki/Wine_barrel\n\"Wine barrel\") and inside the [wine bottle](/wiki/Wine_bottle \"Wine bottle\")\nitself as in [the production](/wiki/Sparkling_wine_production \"Sparkling wine\nproduction\") of many [sparkling wines](/wiki/Sparkling_wine \"Sparkling\nwine\").[1][2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Process\n    * 2.1 Other compounds involved\n  * 3 Winemaking considerations\n  * 4 Other types of fermentation\n    * 4.1 Bottle fermentation\n    * 4.2 Carbonic maceration\n    * 4.3 Malolactic fermentation\n  * 5 References\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fermentation_in_winemaking&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nSee also: [History of wine](/wiki/History_of_wine \"History of wine\")\n\nThe natural occurrence of fermentation means it was probably first observed\nlong ago by humans.[3] The earliest uses of the word \"fermentation\" in\nrelation to winemaking was in reference to the apparent \"boiling\" within the\nmust that came from the [anaerobic\nreaction](/wiki/Fermentation_\\(biochemistry\\) \"Fermentation \\(biochemistry\\)\")\nof the yeast to the [sugars](/wiki/Sugars_in_wine \"Sugars in wine\") in the\ngrape juice and the release of carbon dioxide. The [Latin](/wiki/Latin\n\"Latin\") _fervere_ means, literally, _to boil_. In the mid-19th century,\n[Louis Pasteur](/wiki/Louis_Pasteur \"Louis Pasteur\") noted the connection\nbetween yeast and the process of the fermentation in which the yeast act as\ncatalyst and mediator through a series of a reaction that convert sugar into\nalcohol. The discovery of the [Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas](/wiki/Glycolysis\n\"Glycolysis\") pathway by [Gustav Embden](/wiki/Gustav_Embden \"Gustav Embden\"),\n[Otto Fritz Meyerhof](/wiki/Otto_Fritz_Meyerhof \"Otto Fritz Meyerhof\") and\n[Jakub Karol Parnas](/wiki/Jakub_Karol_Parnas \"Jakub Karol Parnas\") in the\nearly 20th century contributed more to the understanding of the complex\nchemical processes involved in the conversion of sugar to alcohol.[4]\n\n##\nProcess[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fermentation_in_winemaking&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Process\")]\n\nSee also: [Yeast in winemaking](/wiki/Yeast_in_winemaking \"Yeast in\nwinemaking\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Yeast_on_grapes.jpg/220px-\nYeast_on_grapes.jpg)](/wiki/File:Yeast_on_grapes.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Yeast_on_grapes.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Bloom\", visible as a dusting on the berries\n\nIn winemaking, there are distinctions made between _ambient yeast_ s which are\nnaturally present in wine cellars, vineyards and on the grapes themselves\n(sometimes known as a grape's \"bloom\" or \"blush\") and _cultured yeast_ which\nare specifically isolated and inoculated for use in winemaking. The most\ncommon [genera](/wiki/Genus \"Genus\") of wild yeasts found in winemaking\ninclude _[Candida](/wiki/Candida_\\(genus\\) \"Candida \\(genus\\)\"),\n[Klöckera/Hanseniaspora](/w/index.php?title=Kl%C3%B6ckera/Hanseniaspora&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Klöckera/Hanseniaspora \\(page does not exist\\)\"),\n[Metschnikowiaceae](/wiki/Metschnikowiaceae \"Metschnikowiaceae\"),\n[Pichia](/wiki/Pichia \"Pichia\")_ and\n_[Zygosaccharomyces](/wiki/Zygosaccharomyces \"Zygosaccharomyces\")_. Wild\nyeasts can produce high-quality, unique-flavored wines; however, they are\noften unpredictable and may introduce less desirable traits to the wine, and\ncan even contribute to spoilage. It should be noted that few yeast, and lactic\nand acetic acid bacterial colonies naturally live on the surface of grapes,[5]\nbut traditional wine makers, particularly in Europe, advocate use of ambient\nyeast as a characteristic of the region's _[terroir](/wiki/Terroir \"Terroir\")_\n; nevertheless, many winemakers prefer to control fermentation with\npredictable cultured yeast. The cultured yeasts most commonly used in\nwinemaking belong to the _[Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae](/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\")_ (also\nknown as \"sugar yeast\") species. Within this species are several hundred\ndifferent [strains](/wiki/Strain_\\(biology\\) \"Strain \\(biology\\)\") of yeast\nthat can be used during fermentation to affect the heat or vigor of the\nprocess and enhance or suppress certain flavor characteristics of the\n[varietal](/wiki/Varietal \"Varietal\"). The use of different strains of yeasts\nis a major contributor to the diversity of wine, even among the same grape\nvariety.[6] Alternative, non-_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ , yeasts are being\nused more prevalently in the industry to add greater complexity to wine. After\na winery has been in operation for a number of years, few yeast strains are\nactively involved in the fermentation process. The use of active dry yeasts\nreduces the variety of strains that appear in spontaneous fermentation by\noutcompeting those strains that are naturally present.[7]\n\nThe addition of cultured yeast normally occurs with the yeast first in a dried\nor \"inactive\" state and is reactivated in warm water or diluted grape juice\nprior to being added to the [must](/wiki/Must \"Must\"). To thrive and be active\nin fermentation, the yeast needs access to a continuous supply of\n[carbon](/wiki/Carbon \"Carbon\"), [nitrogen](/wiki/Yeast_assimilable_nitrogen\n\"Yeast assimilable nitrogen\"), [sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur \"Sulfur\"),\n[phosphorus](/wiki/Phosphorus \"Phosphorus\") as well as access to various\n[vitamins](/wiki/Vitamins \"Vitamins\") and [minerals](/wiki/Dietary_mineral\n\"Dietary mineral\"). These components are naturally present in the grape\n[must](/wiki/Must \"Must\") but their amount may be corrected by adding\nnutrients to the wine, in order to foster a more encouraging environment for\nthe yeast. Newly formulated time-release nutrients, specifically manufactured\nfor wine fermentations, offer the most advantageous conditions for yeast.\n[Oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\") is needed as well, but in wine making, the\nrisk of [oxidation](/wiki/Oxidation \"Oxidation\") and the lack of alcohol\nproduction from oxygenated yeast requires the exposure of oxygen to be kept at\na minimum.[8]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Yeast_and_nutrients.JPG/220px-\nYeast_and_nutrients.JPG)](/wiki/File:Yeast_and_nutrients.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Yeast_and_nutrients.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nDry winemaking yeast (left) and yeast nutrients used in the rehydration\nprocess to stimulate yeast cells.\n\nUpon the introduction of active yeasts to the grape must,\n[phosphates](/wiki/Phosphate \"Phosphate\") are attached to the sugar and the\nsix-carbon sugar [molecules](/wiki/Molecule \"Molecule\") begin to be split into\nthree-carbon pieces and go through a series of [rearrangement\nreactions](/wiki/Rearrangement_reaction \"Rearrangement reaction\"). During this\nprocess, the [carboxylic](/wiki/Carboxylic \"Carboxylic\") carbon atom is\nreleased in the form of carbon dioxide with the remaining components becoming\n[acetaldehyde](/wiki/Acetaldehyde \"Acetaldehyde\"). The absence of oxygen in\nthis [anaerobic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anaerobic \"wikt:anaerobic\")\nprocess allows the acetaldehyde to be eventually converted, by reduction, to\n[ethanol](/wiki/Ethanol \"Ethanol\"). During the conversion of acetaldehyde, a\nsmall amount is converted, by oxidation, to [acetic acid](/wiki/Acetic_acid\n\"Acetic acid\") which, in excess, can contribute to the wine fault known as\n[volatile acidity](/wiki/Wine_fault#Acetic_acid \"Wine fault\") (vinegar taint).\nAfter the yeast has exhausted its life cycle, they fall to the bottom of the\nfermentation tank as sediment known as [lees](/wiki/Lees_\\(fermentation\\)\n\"Lees \\(fermentation\\)\").[9] Yeast ceases its activity whenever all of the\nsugar in must has been converted into other chemicals or whenever the alcohol\ncontent has reached 15% alcohol per unit volume; a concentration strong enough\nto halt the enzymatic activity of almost all strains of yeast.[10]\n\n### Other compounds\ninvolved[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fermentation_in_winemaking&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Other compounds involved\")]\n\nThe [metabolism](/wiki/Metabolism \"Metabolism\") of [amino\nacids](/wiki/Amino_acid \"Amino acid\") and breakdown of sugars by yeasts has\nthe effect of creating other biochemical compounds that can contribute to the\nflavor and [aroma of wine](/wiki/Aroma_of_wine \"Aroma of wine\"). These\ncompounds can be considered \"[volatile](/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound\n\"Volatile organic compound\")\" like [aldehydes](/wiki/Aldehyde \"Aldehyde\"),\n[ethyl acetate](/wiki/Ethyl_acetate \"Ethyl acetate\"), [ester](/wiki/Ester\n\"Ester\"), [fatty acids](/wiki/Fatty_acid \"Fatty acid\"), [fusel\noils](/wiki/Fusel_oils \"Fusel oils\"), [hydrogen\nsulfide](/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide \"Hydrogen sulfide\"), [ketones](/wiki/Ketone\n\"Ketone\") and [mercaptans](/wiki/Mercaptans \"Mercaptans\") or \"non-volatile\"\nlike [glycerol](/wiki/Glycerol \"Glycerol\"), acetic acid and [succinic\nacid](/wiki/Succinic_acid \"Succinic acid\"). Yeast also has the effect during\nfermentation of releasing [glycoside hydrolase](/wiki/Glycoside_hydrolase\n\"Glycoside hydrolase\") which can [hydrolyse](/wiki/Hydrolyse \"Hydrolyse\") the\nflavor precursors of [aliphatics](/wiki/Aliphatics \"Aliphatics\") (a flavor\ncomponent that reacts with [oak](/wiki/Oak_\\(wine\\) \"Oak \\(wine\\)\")),\n[benzene](/wiki/Benzene \"Benzene\") derivatives,\n[monoterpenes](/wiki/Monoterpene \"Monoterpene\") (responsible for floral aromas\nfrom grapes like [Muscat](/wiki/Muscat_\\(grape_and_wine\\) \"Muscat \\(grape and\nwine\\)\") and [Traminer](/wiki/Traminer \"Traminer\")),\n[norisoprenoids](/wiki/Norisoprenoid \"Norisoprenoid\") (responsible for some of\nthe spice notes in [Chardonnay](/wiki/Chardonnay \"Chardonnay\")), and\n[phenols](/wiki/Natural_phenols_in_wine \"Natural phenols in wine\").\n\nSome strains of yeasts can generate volatile [thiols](/wiki/Thiol \"Thiol\")\nwhich contribute to the fruity aromas in many wines such as the\n[gooseberry](/wiki/Gooseberry \"Gooseberry\") scent commonly associated with\n[Sauvignon blanc](/wiki/Sauvignon_blanc \"Sauvignon blanc\").  \n_[Brettanomyces](/wiki/Brettanomyces \"Brettanomyces\")_ yeasts are responsible\nfor the \"barnyard aroma\" characteristic in some red wines like\n[Burgundy](/wiki/Burgundy_wine \"Burgundy wine\") and [Pinot\nnoir](/wiki/Pinot_noir \"Pinot noir\").[11]\n\nMethanol is not a major constituent of wine. The usual concentration range is\nbetween 0.1 g/liter and 0.2 g/liter. These small traces have no adverse effect\non people and no direct effect on the senses.[12]\n\n## Winemaking\nconsiderations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fermentation_in_winemaking&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Winemaking considerations\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Fermenting.jpg/220px-\nFermenting.jpg)](/wiki/File:Fermenting.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Fermenting.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCarbon dioxide is visible during the fermentation process in the form of\nbubbles in the must.\n\nDuring fermentation, there are several factors that winemakers take into\nconsideration, with the most influential to ethanol production being sugar\ncontent in the must, the yeast strain used, and the fermentation\ntemperature.[13] The biochemical process of fermentation itself creates a lot\nof residual [heat](/wiki/Heat \"Heat\") which can take the must out of the ideal\ntemperature range for the wine. Typically, white wine is fermented between\n18-20 °C (64-68 °F) though a wine maker may choose to use a higher temperature\nto bring out some of the complexity of the wine. Red wine is typically\nfermented at higher temperatures up to 29 °C (85 °F). Fermentation at higher\ntemperatures may have adverse effect on the wine in stunning the yeast to\ninactivity and even \"boiling off\" some of the flavors of the wines. Some\nwinemakers may ferment their red wines at cooler temperatures, more typical of\nwhite wines, in order to bring out more fruit flavors.[9]\n\nTo control the heat generated during fermentation, the winemaker must choose a\nsuitable vessel size or else use a cooling device. Various kinds of cooling\ndevices are available, ranging from the ancient [Bordeaux](/wiki/Bordeaux_wine\n\"Bordeaux wine\") practice of placing the fermentation vat atop blocks of ice\nto sophisticated fermentation tanks that have built-in cooling rings.[14]\n\nA risk factor involved with fermentation is the development of chemical\nresidue and spoilage which can be corrected with the addition of [sulfur\ndioxide](/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide \"Sulfur dioxide\") (SO2), although excess SO2 can\nlead to a wine fault. A winemaker who wishes to make a wine with high levels\nof [residual sugar](/wiki/Residual_sugar \"Residual sugar\") (like a [dessert\nwine](/wiki/Dessert_wine \"Dessert wine\")) may stop fermentation early either\nby dropping the temperature of the must to stun the yeast or by adding a high\nlevel of alcohol (like [brandy](/wiki/Brandy \"Brandy\")) to the must to kill\noff the yeast and create a [fortified wine](/wiki/Fortified_wine \"Fortified\nwine\").[9]\n\nThe ethanol produced through fermentation acts as an important co-solvent to\nthe non-polar compound that water cannot dissolve, such as pigments from grape\nskins, giving wine varieties their distinct color, and other aromatics.\nEthanol and the acidity of wine act as an inhibitor to bacterial growth,\nallowing wine to be safely kept for years in the absence of air.[15]\n\n## Other types of\nfermentation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fermentation_in_winemaking&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Other types of fermentation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Barrel_fermented_California_Chard.jpg/220px-\nBarrel_fermented_California_Chard.jpg)](/wiki/File:Barrel_fermented_California_Chard.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Barrel_fermented_California_Chard.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA California Chardonnay that shows it has been barrel fermented.\n\nIn winemaking, there are different processes that fall under the title of\n\"Fermentation\" but might not follow the same procedure commonly associated\nwith wine fermentation.\n\n### Bottle\nfermentation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fermentation_in_winemaking&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Bottle fermentation\")]\n\nBottle fermentation is a method of [sparkling wine\nproduction](/wiki/Sparkling_wine_production \"Sparkling wine production\"),\noriginating in the [Champagne](/wiki/Champagne_\\(wine_region\\) \"Champagne\n\\(wine region\\)\") region where after the [cuvee](/wiki/Cuvee \"Cuvee\") has gone\nthrough a primary yeast fermentation the wine is then bottled and goes through\na secondary fermentation where sugar and additional yeast known as _liqueur de\ntirage_ is added to the wine. This secondary fermentation is what creates the\ncarbon dioxide bubbles that sparkling wine is known for.[16]\n\n### Carbonic\nmaceration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fermentation_in_winemaking&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Carbonic maceration\")]\n\nThe process of [carbonic maceration](/wiki/Carbonic_maceration \"Carbonic\nmaceration\") is also known as **whole grape fermentation** where instead of\nyeast being added, the grapes fermentation is encouraged to take place inside\nthe individual grape berries. This method is common in the creation of\n[Beaujolais](/wiki/Beaujolais \"Beaujolais\") wine and involves whole clusters\nof grapes being stored in a closed container with the oxygen in the container\nbeing replaced with carbon dioxide.[17] Unlike normal fermentation where yeast\nconverts sugar into alcohol, carbonic maceration works by enzymes within the\ngrape breaking down the cellular matter to form [ethanol](/wiki/Ethanol\n\"Ethanol\") and other chemical properties. The resulting wines are typically\nsoft and fruity.[18]\n\n### Malolactic\nfermentation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fermentation_in_winemaking&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Malolactic fermentation\")]\n\nInstead of yeast, [bacteria](/wiki/Bacteria \"Bacteria\") play a fundamental\nrole in [malolactic fermentation](/wiki/Malolactic_fermentation \"Malolactic\nfermentation\") which is essentially the conversion of [malic\nacid](/wiki/Malic_acid \"Malic acid\") into [lactic acid](/wiki/Lactic_acid\n\"Lactic acid\"). This has the benefit of reducing some of the tartness and\nmaking the resulting wine taste softer. Depending on the style of wine that\nthe winemaker is trying to produce, malolactic fermentation may take place at\nthe very same time as the yeast fermentation.[19] Alternatively, some strains\nof yeast may be developed that can convert L-malate to L-lactate during\nalcohol fermentation.[20] For example, _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ strain ML01\n(_S. cerevisiae strain_ ML01), which carries a gene encoding malolactic enzyme\nfrom _Oenococcus oeni_ and a gene encoding malate permease from\n_Schizosaccharomyces pombe_. _S. cerevisiae strain_ ML01 has received\nregulatory approval in both Canada and the United States.[21]\n\n  * [Co-fermentation](/wiki/Co-fermentation \"Co-fermentation\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Fermentation_in_winemaking&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** J.
