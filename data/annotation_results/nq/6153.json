canon\")]\n\n### _Dhammacakkappavattana\nSutta_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\")]\n\nIn the [Pāli Canon](/wiki/P%C4%81li_Canon \"Pāli Canon\") of [Theravada\nBuddhism](/wiki/Theravada \"Theravada\"), the term \"Middle Way\" was used in the\n_[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta](/wiki/Dhammacakkappavattana_Sutta\n\"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\")_ , which the Buddhist tradition regards to be\nthe first teaching that the Buddha delivered after his awakening.[b] In this\nsutta, the Buddha describes the [Noble Eightfold\nPath](/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path \"Noble Eightfold Path\") as the middle way of\nmoderation, between the extremes of sensual indulgence and self-\nmortification:[2]\n\n> Monks, these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone\n> forth from the household life. There is addiction to indulgence of sense-\n> pleasures, which is low, coarse, the way of ordinary people, unworthy, and\n> unprofitable; and there is addiction to self-mortification, which is\n> painful, unworthy, and unprofitable.  \n>\n>\n> Avoiding both these extremes, the [Tathagata](/wiki/Tath%C4%81gata\n> \"Tathāgata\") (the Perfect One) has realized the Middle Path; it gives\n> vision, gives knowledge, and leads to calm, to insight, to enlightenment and\n> to Nibbana. And what is that Middle Path realized by the Tathagata...? It is\n> the Noble Eightfold path, and nothing else, namely: right understanding,\n> right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,\n> right mindfulness and right concentration.[3]\n\nAccording to the scriptural account, when the Buddha delivered the\n_Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta_ , he was addressing five ascetics with whom he\nhad previously practiced severe austerities.[c] Thus, it is this personal\ncontext as well as the broader context of Indian [shramanic](/wiki/Shramana\n\"Shramana\") practices that gives particular relevancy to the caveat against\nthe extreme (Pali: _antā_) of self-mortification (Pali _attakilamatha_).\n\nLater [Pali literature](/wiki/Pali_literature \"Pali literature\") has also used\nthe phrase _Middle Way_ to refer to the Buddha's teaching of [dependent\norigination](/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da \"Pratītyasamutpāda\") as a view\nbetween the extremes[2] of [eternalism](/wiki/Sassatavada \"Sassatavada\") and\n[annihilationism](/wiki/Annihilationism \"Annihilationism\").\n\n### Dependent\nOrigination[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Dependent Origination\")]\n\nMain article: [Pratītyasamutpāda](/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da\n\"Pratītyasamutpāda\")\n\n[Pratītyasamutpāda](/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da \"Pratītyasamutpāda\"), or\n\"dependent origination\", describes the existence of objects and phenomena as\nthe result of causes. When one of these causes changes or disappears, the\nresulting object or phenomena will also change or disappear, as will the\nobjects or phenomena depending on the changing object or phenomena. Thus,\nthere is nothing with an eternal self or atman, only mutually dependent\norigination and existence. However, the absence of an eternal atman does not\nmean there is nothing at all. Early Buddhism adheres to a realistic approach\nwhich does not deny existence as such, but denies the existence of eternal and\nindependent substances. This view is the Middle Way between eternalism and\nannihilationism:\n\n> The understanding that sees a \"person\" as subsisting in the causal\n> connectedness of dependent arising is often presented in Buddhist thought as\n> \"the middle\" (_madhyama/majjhima_) between the views of \"eternalism\"\n> (_śaśvata-/sassata-vāda_) and \"annihilationism\" (_uccheda-vāda_).[4][d]\n\n### Anatta[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Anatta\")]\n\nDependent origination views human persons too as devoid of a personal essence\nor _atman_. In Theravadin literature, this usage of the term \"Middle Way\" can\nbe found in 5th century CE [Pali commentaries](/wiki/Atthakatha \"Atthakatha\"):\n\n> The Tathāgata teaches the [Dhamma](/wiki/Dharma \"Dharma\") by the middle\n> without veering to either of these extremes – eternalism or annihilationism\n> – having abandoned them without reservation. He teaches while being\n> established in the middle way. What is that Dhamma? By the formula of\n> dependent origination, the effect is shown to occur through the cause and to\n> cease with the cessation of the cause, but no agent or experiencer [...] is\n> described.[5]\n\nIn the _[Visuddhimagga](/wiki/Visuddhimagga \"Visuddhimagga\")_ , the following\nis found :\n\n> \"Dependent origination\" (_paticca-samuppada_) represents the middle way,\n> which rejects the doctrines, 'He who acts is he who reaps' and 'One acts\n> while another reaps' (S.ii.20) ...\"[6]\n\nIn the Pali Canon itself, this view is not explicitly called the \"Middle Way\"\nbut is literally referred to as \"teaching by the middle\" (_majjhena dhamma_).\n\n### Rebirth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Rebirth\")]\n\n[Paticcasamuppāda](/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da \"Pratītyasamutpāda\")\n\"dependent origination\" also gives a rationale for\n[rebirth](/wiki/Rebirth_\\(Buddhism\\) \"Rebirth \\(Buddhism\\)\"):\n\n> Conditioned Arising is [...] a 'Middle Way' which avoids the extremes of\n> 'eternalism' and 'annihilationism': the survival of an eternal self, or the\n> total annihilation of a person at death.[7]\n\nIn Theravadin [soteriology](/wiki/Soteriology \"Soteriology\"), the principle of\n[anattā](/wiki/Anatta \"Anatta\") means there is neither a permanent self nor\ncomplete annihilation of the person at death; there is only the arising and\nceasing of causally related phenomena.[e] Paticcasamuppāda also describes the\n[Twelve Nidānas](/wiki/Twelve_Nid%C4%81nas \"Twelve Nidānas\") of\n[dukkha](/wiki/Dukkha \"Dukkha\") \"suffering\" that lead to rebirth, from\n[avijjā](/wiki/Avidy%C4%81_\\(Buddhism\\) \"Avidyā \\(Buddhism\\)\") \"ignorance\" to\n[jarāmaraṇa](/wiki/Jar%C4%81mara%E1%B9%87a \"Jarāmaraṇa\") \"aging and death\",\nand the parallel reverse-order interdependent cessation of these factors.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, only [nibbana](/wiki/Nirvana_\\(Buddhism\\) \"Nirvana\n\\(Buddhism\\)\") is unconditioned; nonetheless, even the [arahant](/wiki/Arhat\n\"Arhat\") or [tathāgata](/wiki/Tath%C4%81gata \"Tathāgata\"), upon passing,\nneither exists nor non-exists according to the Pāli Canon.\n\n## Mahayana[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Mahayana\")]\n\nIn [Mahayana Buddhism](/wiki/Mahayana \"Mahayana\"), the _Middle Way_ refers to\nthe insight into [śūnyatā](/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81 \"Śūnyatā\") \"emptiness\"\nthat transcends the extremes of existence and non-existence, the [two truths\ndoctrine](/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine \"Two truths doctrine\"). According to\nKalupahana,\n\n> Two aspects of the Buddha's teachings, the philosophical and the practical,\n> which are mutually dependent, are clearly enunciated in two discourses, the\n> _Kaccāyanagotta-sutta_ and the _Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta_ , both of which\n> are held in high esteem by almost all schools of Buddhism in spite of their\n> sectarian rivalries. The _Kaccāyanagotta-sutta_ , quoted by almost all the\n> major schools of Buddhism, deals with the philosophical \"middle path\",\n> placed against the backdrop of two absolutistic theories in Indian\n> philosophy, namely, permanent existence (atthitaa) propounded in the early\n> Upanishads and nihilistic non-existence (natthitā) suggested by the\n> Materialists.[8]\n\n### Madhyamaka[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Madhyamaka\")]\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, the [Madhyamaka](/wiki/Madhyamaka \"Madhyamaka\") (\"Middle\nWay\") school portrays a \"middle way\" position between metaphysical claims that\nthings ultimately either exist or do not exist.[9] [Nagarjuna](/wiki/Nagarjuna\n\"Nagarjuna\")'s influential\n_[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā](/wiki/M%C5%ABlamadhyamakak%C4%81rik%C4%81\n\"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\")_ deconstructs the usage of terms describing reality,\nleading to the insight into [śūnyatā](/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81 \"Śūnyatā\")\n\"emptiness\". It contains only one reference to a sutta, the _Kacc _ā_\nyanagotta Sutta_ from the [Samyutta Nikaya](/wiki/Samyutta_Nikaya \"Samyutta\nNikaya\"):\n\n\"Everything exists\": That is one extreme.  \n\"Everything doesn't exist\": That is a second extreme.  \nAvoiding these two extremes,  \nThe Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle.[10]\n\n### East Asian\nconceptions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: East Asian conceptions\")]\n\n#### Tendai[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Tendai\")]\n\nIn the [Tendai](/wiki/Tendai \"Tendai\") school, the _Middle Way_ refers to the\nsynthesis of the thesis that all things are śūnyatā and the antithesis that\nall things have phenomenal existence.[11]\n\n#### Chan Buddhism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Chan Buddhism\")]\n\nIn [Chan Buddhism](/wiki/Chan_Buddhism \"Chan Buddhism\"), the Middle Way\ndescribes the realization of being free of the one-sidedness of perspective\nthat takes the extremes of any polarity as objective reality. In chapter ten\nof the _[Platform Sutra](/wiki/Platform_Sutra \"Platform Sutra\")_ ,\n[Huineng](/wiki/Huineng \"Huineng\") gives instructions for the teaching of the\nDharma. Huineng enumerates 36 basic oppositions of consciousness and explains\nhow the Way is free from both extremes:\n\n> If one asks about the worldly, use the paired opposite of the saintly; if\n> asking about the saintly use the paired opposite of the worldly. The mutual\n> causation of the Way of dualities, gives birth to the meaning of the Middle\n> Way. So, for a single question, a single pair of opposites, and for other\n> questions the single [pair] that accords with this fashion, then you do not\n> lose the principle.[12][f]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png) | [Wikisource](/wiki/Wikisource \"Wikisource\") has original text related to this article: **[Saṃyukta Āgama 301: Kātyāyana Gotra Sūtra](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83yukta_%C4%80gama_301:_K%C4%81ty%C4%81yana_Gotra_S%C5%ABtra \"wikisource:Saṃyukta Āgama 301: Kātyāyana Gotra Sūtra\")**  \n---|---  \n  \n  * [moderation](/wiki/Moderation \"Moderation\")\n  * [Argument to moderation](/wiki/Argument_to_moderation \"Argument to moderation\")\n  * [Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta](/wiki/Dhammacakkappavattana_Sutta \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\")\n  * [Golden Mean](/wiki/Golden_mean_\\(philosophy\\) \"Golden mean \\(philosophy\\)\")\n  * [Sirat al-Mustaqim](/wiki/Sirat_al-Mustaqim \"Sirat al-Mustaqim\"), Straight Path or Middle Way in Islam\n  * [Undue burden standard](/wiki/Undue_burden_standard \"Undue burden standard\") \\- \"a 'middle way' forward\" in [Constitutional law](/wiki/Constitutional_law \"Constitutional law\")\n  * [Via media](/wiki/Via_media \"Via media\") ‘Middle Road’\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Middle_Way&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Also see the Pali version of the _Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta_ (available on-line at [SLTP, n.d.-b, sutta 12.2.1](http://www.mettanet.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/3Samyutta-Nikaya/Samyutta5/55-Sacca-Samyutta/02-Dhammacakkappavattanavaggo-p.html)) where the phrase _majjhimā patipadā_ is repeatedly used.\n  2. **Jump up ^** _[Samyutta Nikaya](/wiki/Samyutta_Nikaya \"Samyutta Nikaya\")_ , 56:11.

It is a 'teaching by the middle' because it transcends two extreme views that polarize philosophical reflection on the human condition. One extreme, the metaphysical thesis of eternalism (_sassatavāda_), asserts that the core of human identity is an indestructible and eternal self, whether individual or universal [...] The other extreme, annihilationism (_ucchedavāda_), holds that at death the person is utterly annihilated.... Dependent origination offers a radically different perspective that transcends the two extremes. It shows that individual existence is constituted by a current of conditioned phenomena devoid of a metaphysical self yet continuing on from birth to birth as long as the causes that sustain it remain effective.\n  6. **Jump up ^** For example: \"Suppose there is a person who asks, ‘What is taken for and called darkness?’ Reply and say, ‘Light is the proximate cause and darkness is the contributory cause.
