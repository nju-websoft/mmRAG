Every ancient\nreference to Balaam considers him a [non-Israelite](/wiki/Gentile \"Gentile\"),\na [prophet](/wiki/Prophet \"Prophet\"), and the _son of Beor_ , though _Beor_ is\nnot clearly identified. Though some sources may only describe the positive\nblessings he delivers upon the [Israelites](/wiki/Israelites \"Israelites\"), he\nis reviled as a \"[wicked](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wicked \"wikt:wicked\")\nman\"[2] in both Torah and its commentaries, as well as in the New Testament.\nBalaam refused to speak what God did not speak and would not curse the\nIsraelites, even though King [Balak](/wiki/Balak \"Balak\") of [Moab](/wiki/Moab\n\"Moab\") offered him money to do so (Numbers 22–24). But Balaam's error and the\nsource of his wickedness came from sabotaging the Israelites as they entered\nthe [Promised Land](/wiki/Promised_Land \"Promised Land\"). According to\n[Revelation](/wiki/Book_of_Revelation \"Book of Revelation\") 2:14, Balaam told\nKing Balak how to get the Israelites to commit sin by enticing them with\nsexual immorality and food sacrificed to idols. The Israelites fell into\ntransgression due to these traps and God sent a deadly plague to them as a\nresult (Numbers 31:16).\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Balaam and Balak\n  * 2 Prophecies\n  * 3 Balaam in rabbinic literature\n  * 4 Balaam in the New Testament, Josephus, and Philo\n  * 5 Balaam in the Quran\n  * 6 Balaam and the Deir Alla inscription\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Balaam and Balak[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Balaam&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Balaam and Balak\")]\n\nThe main story of Balaam occurs during the sojourn of the Israelites in the\nplains of [Moab](/wiki/Moab \"Moab\"), east of the [Jordan\nRiver](/wiki/Jordan_River \"Jordan River\"), at the close of 40 years of\nwandering, shortly before the death of Moses and the crossing of the Jordan.\nThe Israelites have already defeated two kings in Transjordan:\n[Sihon](/wiki/Sihon \"Sihon\"), king of the [Amorites](/wiki/Amorites\n\"Amorites\"), and [Og](/wiki/Og \"Og\"), king of [Bashan](/wiki/Bashan \"Bashan\").\n[Balak](/wiki/Balak \"Balak\"), king of [Moab](/wiki/Moab \"Moab\"),[3]\nconsequently becomes alarmed, and sends elders of Midian and his Moabite\nmessengers,[4] to Balaam, son of Beor, to induce him to come and curse Israel.\nBalaam's location, [Pethor](/wiki/Pethor \"Pethor\"), is simply given as \"which\nis by the river of the land of the children of his people\" in the [Masoretic\nText](/wiki/Masoretic_Text \"Masoretic Text\") and the\n[Septuagint](/wiki/Septuagint \"Septuagint\"), though the [Samaritan\nPentateuch](/wiki/Samaritan_Pentateuch \"Samaritan Pentateuch\"),\n[Vulgate](/wiki/Vulgate \"Vulgate\"), and [Peshitta](/wiki/Peshitta \"Peshitta\")\nall identify his land as [Ammon](/wiki/Ammon \"Ammon\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Nuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2.png/220px-\nNuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2.png)](/wiki/File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nBalaam and the angel. _[Nuremberg Chronicle](/wiki/Nuremberg_Chronicle\n\"Nuremberg Chronicle\")_ (1493)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/John_Linnell_-\n_The_Prophet_Balaam_and_the_Angel_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-\nJohn_Linnell_-_The_Prophet_Balaam_and_the_Angel_-\n_Google_Art_Project.jpg)](/wiki/File:John_Linnell_-\n_The_Prophet_Balaam_and_the_Angel_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:John_Linnell_-_The_Prophet_Balaam_and_the_Angel_-\n_Google_Art_Project.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Prophet Balaam and the Angel\n\nBalaam sends back word that he can only do what [YHWH](/wiki/YHWH \"YHWH\")\ncommands, and God has, via a nocturnal dream, told him not to go. Balak\nconsequently sends higher-ranking priests and offers Balaam honours; Balaam\ncontinues to press God, and God finally permits him to go but with\ninstructions to say only what he commands. Balaam then sets out in the morning\nwith the princes of Moab. God becomes angry that he went, and sends the [Angel\nof the Lord](/wiki/Angel_of_the_Lord \"Angel of the Lord\") (Numbers 22:22) to\nprevent him. At first, the angel is seen only by the [donkey](/wiki/Donkey\n\"Donkey\") Balaam is riding, which tries to avoid the angel. After Balaam\nstarts punishing the donkey for refusing to move, it is miraculously given the\npower to speak to Balaam (Numbers 22:28), and it complains about Balaam's\ntreatment. At this point, Balaam is allowed to see the angel, who informs him\nthat the donkey is the only reason the angel did not kill Balaam. Balaam\nimmediately repents, but is told to go on.\n\nBalak meets with Balaam at [Kirjat Huzoth](/wiki/Kirjath-huzoth \"Kirjath-\nhuzoth\"), and they go to the \"high places of [Baal](/wiki/Baal \"Baal\")\", and\noffer sacrifices on seven altars, leading to Balaam being given a prophecy by\n[Yahweh](/wiki/Yahweh \"Yahweh\"), which he speaks to Balak. However, the\nprophecy blesses Israel; Balak remonstrates, but Balaam reminds him that he\ncan only speak the words put in his mouth, so Balak takes him to another \"high\nplace\" at [Pisgah](/wiki/Mount_Pisgah_\\(Bible\\) \"Mount Pisgah \\(Bible\\)\"), to\ntry again. Building another seven altars here, and making sacrifices on each,\nBalaam provides another prophecy blessing Israel.\n\nBalaam finally gets taken by a now very frustrated Balak to [Peor](/wiki/Peor\n\"Peor\"), and, after the seven sacrifices there, decides not to \"seek\nenchantments\" but instead looks upon the Israelites from the peak. The Spirit\nof God comes upon Balaam and he delivers a third positive prophecy concerning\nIsrael. Balak's anger rises to the point where he threatens Balaam, but Balaam\nmerely offers a prediction of fate. Balaam then looks upon the\n[Kenites](/wiki/Kenite \"Kenite\"), and [Amalekites](/wiki/Amalekite\n\"Amalekite\") and offers two more predictions of their fates. Balak and Balaam\nthen go to their respective homes.\n\nLater, Numbers 25:1-9 describes how Israel engaged in sexual immorality and\nidolatry with the women of Moab, resulting in God's anger and a deadly plague.\nNumbers 31:16 attributes this to the advice of Balaam: \"Behold, these caused\nthe children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass\nagainst the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the\ncongregation of the LORD.\"\n\n[Book of Deuteronomy](/wiki/Book_of_Deuteronomy \"Book of Deuteronomy\") 23:3–6\nsummarises these incidents, and further states that the Ammonites were\nassociated with the Moabites. [Joshua](/wiki/Joshua \"Joshua\"), in his farewell\nspeech, also makes reference to it. With God's protection taken from him,\nBalaam is later listed among the Midianites who were killed in revenge for the\n\"matter of Peor\". [Joshua](/wiki/Book_of_Joshua \"Book of Joshua\") 13:22\nrecords that Balaam died \"by the sword\" during a battle for the\n[Reubenite](/wiki/Tribe_of_Reuben \"Tribe of Reuben\") occupation of Moabite\nland.\n\n[Revelation](/wiki/Book_of_Revelation \"Book of Revelation\") also states that\nBalaam \"taught Balak to cast a [stumbling block](/wiki/Stumbling_block\n\"Stumbling block\") before the children of Israel.\"[5]\n\n## Prophecies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Balaam&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Prophecies\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/P1150002_Cognacq-\nJay_Rembrandt_anesse_de_Balaam_rwk.jpg/290px-P1150002_Cognacq-\nJay_Rembrandt_anesse_de_Balaam_rwk.jpg)](/wiki/File:P1150002_Cognacq-\nJay_Rembrandt_anesse_de_Balaam_rwk.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:P1150002_Cognacq-Jay_Rembrandt_anesse_de_Balaam_rwk.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n_[Balaam and the Ass](/wiki/Balaam_and_the_Ass \"Balaam and the Ass\")_ , by\n[Rembrandt van Rijn](/wiki/Rembrandt_van_Rijn \"Rembrandt van Rijn\"), 1626.\n\nAll the prophecies which Balaam makes take the form of (Hebrew) poems:\n\n  * The first, Numbers 23:7–10, prophesies the unique exaltation of the Kingdom of Israel, and its countless numbers.\n  * The second, Numbers 23:18–24, celebrates the moral virtue of Israel, its monarchy, and military conquests.\n  * The third, Numbers 24:3–9, celebrates the glory and conquests of Israel's monarchy.\n  * The fourth, Numbers 24:14–19, prophesies the coming of a king who will conquer Edom and Moab.\n  * The fifth, Numbers 24:20, concerns the ruins of Amalek.\n  * The sixth, Numbers 24:21–22, concerns the destruction of the Kenites by Assyria.\n  * The seventh, Numbers 24:23–24, concerns \"ships of Kittim\" coming from the west to attack Assyria and Eber.\n\nThe poems fall into three groups. The first group consists of two poems which\ncharacteristically start immediately. The third group of three poems also\nstart immediately, but are much shorter. The second group, however, consists\nof two poems which both start:\n\n> Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:\n> He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the\n> Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open ...\n\nOf these, the first and third groups are considered, according to the\n[Documentary Hypothesis](/wiki/Documentary_Hypothesis \"Documentary\nHypothesis\"), to originate within the [Elohist](/wiki/Elohist \"Elohist\") text,\nwhereas the second group is considered to belong to the\n[Jahwist](/wiki/Jahwist \"Jahwist\"). Thus the Elohist describes Balaam giving\ntwo blessings, making sacrifices on seven altars, at the high places of Baal,\nbefore each, then deciding not to \"seek enchantments\" after the third set of\nsacrifices, but to \"set his face upon the wilderness,\" which Balak views as a\nthird blessing, and so Balaam then gives the three final predictions of fate.\nConversely, in the Jahwist source, Balaam arrives, the spirit of God comes\nupon him, and he simply delivers a blessing and a prophecy, in succession.\n\nThe poems themselves are considered to predate the Jahwist and\nElohist,[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] and simply to have been embedded by them in\ntheir works. While the Elohist took off whatever introduction was present in\nthe poems they chose, the Jahwist left it on. An archaeological discovery in\n1967 uncovered references to a _Book of Balaam_ , from which these poems may\nhave originally been taken. The first four poems are commonly regarded as\nancient lyrics of the early monarchy of Israel and Judah, although several\ncritics suspect that they have been edited either from less edifying oracles\nor from oracles which did not refer to Israel.\n\n_Agag_ , mentioned in the third poem, is described as a great king, which does\nnot correspond to the king of the Amalekites who was named [Agag](/wiki/Agag\n\"Agag\"), and described in [I Samuel](/wiki/I_Samuel \"I Samuel\") 15, since that\ndescription considers Amalek to be small and obscure. While it is the\n[Masoretic text](/wiki/Masoretic_text \"Masoretic text\") of the poem that uses\nthe word _Agag_ , the [Septuagint](/wiki/Septuagint \"Septuagint\"), other Greek\nversions, and the Samaritan Pentateuch, all have _Gog_ (i.e., king\n[Gyges](/wiki/Gyges_of_Lydia \"Gyges of Lydia\") of [Lydia](/wiki/Lydia\n\"Lydia\"), 716 BC to 678 BC), implying a very late date for the poem. These\nnames are consequently thought to be textual corruptions, and _[Og](/wiki/Og\n\"Og\")_ has been suggested as the original.\n\nThe final three poems do not refer either to Israel or to Moab, and are thus\nconsidered unusual, since they seem to have little relevance to the narrative.\nIt is thought that they may have been added to bring the number of poems\neither up to five, if inserted into the Elohist source, or up to seven, if\nonly inserted once [JE](/wiki/JE \"JE\") was constructed. While the sixth poem\nrefers to Assyria, it is uncertain whether it is an historical reference to\nancient [Ninevah](/wiki/Ninevah \"Ninevah\"), or a prophecy, which some\nreligious commentators consider refers to the [Seleucid](/wiki/Seleucid\n\"Seleucid\") kingdom of Syria, which also took the name Assyria. The seventh is\nalso ambiguous, and may either be a reference to the [Sea\nPeoples](/wiki/Sea_People \"Sea People\"), or, again in the view of some\nreligious commentators, to the conquest of Persia by [Alexander the\nGreat](/wiki/Alexander_the_Great \"Alexander the Great\").\n\nIn the view of textual criticism[6] the narrative, excepting the episode\ninvolving the donkey, is simply a framework invented in order to be able to\ninsert much older poems.\n\n## Balaam in rabbinic\nliterature[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Balaam&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Balaam in rabbinic literature\")]\n\nIn [rabbinic literature](/wiki/Rabbinic_literature \"Rabbinic literature\")\nBalaam is represented as one of seven [gentile](/wiki/Gentile \"Gentile\")\n[prophets](/wiki/Prophet \"Prophet\"); the other six being Beor (Balaam's\nfather), [Job](/wiki/Book_of_Job \"Book of Job\"), and Job's four friends\n(Talmud, B. B. 15b). In this literature, Balaam gradually acquired a position\namong the non-Jews, which was exalted as much as that of Moses among the Jews\n(Midrash Numbers Rabbah 20); at first being a mere interpreter of dreams, but\nlater becoming a magician, until finally the spirit of prophecy descended upon\nhim (ib. 7).\n\nAccording to a negative view of Balaam in the [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\"),\nBalaam possessed the gift of being able to ascertain the exact moment during\nwhich God is wroth — a gift bestowed upon no other creature. Balaam's\nintention was to curse the Israelites at this moment of wrath, and thus cause\nGod himself to destroy them; but God purposely restrained His anger in order\nto baffle the wicked prophet and to save the nation from extermination\n(Talmud, Berachot 7a). The Talmud also recounts a more positive view of\nBalaam, stating that when the Law was given to Israel, a mighty voice shook\nthe foundations of the earth, so much so that all kings trembled, and in their\nconsternation turned to Balaam, inquiring whether this upheaval of nature\nportended a second deluge; the prophet assured them that what they heard was\nthe voice of God, giving the sacred law to the Israelites (Talmud, Zeb. 116a).\n\nAccording to Jewish legend, Balaam was made this powerful in order to prevent\nthe non-Jewish tribes from saying: \"If we had only had our own Moses, we would\nbe as pious as the Jews.\" The _wicked Balaam_ is included in the list of\npersons born circumcised along with Moses in the book _Abbot De-Rabbi\nNatan_.[7]\n\nIn rabbinical literature the epithet _rasha_ , translating as _the wicked one_\n, is often attached to the name of Balaam (Talmud Berachot l.c.; Taanit 20a;\nMidrash Numbers Rabbah 20:14). Balaam is pictured as blind in one eye and lame\nin one foot (Talmud Sanhedrin 105a); and his disciples (followers) are\ndistinguished by three morally corrupt qualities:\n\n  * an [evil eye](/wiki/Evil_eye \"Evil eye\")\n  * a [haughty](/wiki/Hubris \"Hubris\") bearing\n  * an [avaricious](/wiki/Greed \"Greed\") spirit\n\nDue to his behavior with the Midianites, the Rabbis interpret Balaam as\nresponsible for the behavior during the [Heresy of Peor](/wiki/Heresy_of_Peor\n\"Heresy of Peor\"), which they consider to have been\n[unchastity](/wiki/Unchastity \"Unchastity\"), and consequently the death of\n24,000 victims of the plague which God sent as punishment. When Balaam saw\nthat he could not curse the children of Israel, the Rabbis assert that he\nadvised Balak, as a last resort, to tempt the Hebrew nation to immoral acts\nand, through these, to the worship of Baal-peor. _The God of the Hebrews_ ,\nadds Balaam, according to the Rabbis, _hates lewdness; and severe chastisement\nmust follow_ (San. 106a; Yer. ib. x. 28d; Num. R. l.c.).\n\nThe Rabbis, playing on the name Balaam, call him \"Belo 'Am\" (without people;\nthat is, without a share with the people in the world to come), or \"Billa'\n'Am\" (one that ruined a people); and this hostility against his memory finds\nits climax in the dictum that whenever one discovers a feature of wickedness\nor disgrace in his life, one should preach about it (Sanh. 106b). In the\nprocess of killing Balaam (Num. xxxi. 8), all four legal methods of\nexecution—stoning, burning, decapitating, and strangling—were employed (Sanh.\nl.c.). He met his death at the age of thirty-three (ib.); and it is stated\nthat he had no portion in the world to come (Sanh. x. 2; 90a). The book\ndevotes a special section to the history of the prophet discussing why God has\ntaken away the power of prophecy from the Gentiles (Tan., Balak, 1). Moses is\nexpressly mentioned as the author of this episode in the Pentateuch (B. B.\n14b).J. Sr. H. M.\n\n\"[Ahithophel](/wiki/Ahithophel \"Ahithophel\") of the house of Israel and Balaam\nof the heathen nations were the two great sages of the world who, failing to\nshow gratitude to God for their wisdom, perished in dishonor. To them the\nprophetic word finds application: 'Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,'\nJer. ix. 23\" (Num. R. xxii.).[8]\n\nIn ([Sanhedrin](/wiki/Sanhedrin \"Sanhedrin\") 106b) and\n([Giṭtin](/wiki/Gi%E1%B9%ADtin \"Giṭtin\") 57a) Balaam may be likened to Jesus.\nSome have theorized that Balaam became used as a [pseudonym](/wiki/Pseudonym\n\"Pseudonym\") for [Jesus](/wiki/Jesus \"Jesus\") in Jewish\nliterature.[9][10][11][12]\n\n## Balaam in the New Testament, Josephus, and\nPhilo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Balaam&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section:\nBalaam in the New Testament, Josephus, and Philo\")]\n\nIn the [New Testament](/wiki/New_Testament \"New Testament\"), Balaam is cited\nas a type of avarice; for example in [Book of\nRevelation](/wiki/Book_of_Revelation \"Book of Revelation\") 2:14 we read of\nfalse teachers at Pergamum who held the \"teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak\nto cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things\nsacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.\" Balaam has attracted much\ninterest, alike from Jews, Christians, and Muslims. [Josephus](/wiki/Josephus\n\"Josephus\") paraphrases the story more so, and speaks of Balaam as the best\nprophet of his time, but with a disposition ill-adapted to resist\n[temptation](/wiki/Temptation \"Temptation\").[13] [Philo](/wiki/Philo \"Philo\")\ndescribes him as a great magician in the _Life of Moses_ ;[14] elsewhere he\nspeaks of \"the [sophist](/wiki/Sophist \"Sophist\") Balaam, being,\" i.e.\nsymbolizing \"a vain crowd of contrary and warring opinions\" and again as \"a\nvain people\" — both phrases being based on a mistaken etymology of the name\nBalaam.\n\nA man also named Balaam also figures as an example of a false prophet\nmotivated by greed or avarice in both [2 Peter](/wiki/2_Peter \"2 Peter\") 2:15\nand in [Jude](/wiki/Jude_the_Apostle \"Jude the Apostle\") 1:11. This Balaam is\nlisted as the son of Bezer, which is usually identified as\nBeor.[15][16][17][18] Some authors claim that Bezer was the Aramaic\npronunciation of Beor,[17] while others hold that Peter was attempting to play\noff the Hebrew word _basar_ or \"flesh\" to insult Balaam. Later Jewish\ntradition similarly played with Balaam's name to call him corrupt and imply\nbestiality. Still other authors hold that Bezer and Beor are distinct, while\nstill identifying the Balaams of the Old and New Testaments, claiming that\nBeor is Balaam's father and Bezer is Balaam's home town.[18]\n\n## Balaam in the Quran[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Balaam&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Balaam in the Quran\")]\n\n  * [Musa](/wiki/Moses_in_Islam \"Moses in Islam\")\n  * _Mūsa_ ٰمُوسَى\n  * Moses\n\n  \n---  \n[![Musa](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Musa_%28Moses%291.png/200px-\nMusa_%28Moses%291.png)](/wiki/File:Musa_\\(Moses\\)1.png \"Musa\")  \n  \n  * [Ten Commandments](/wiki/Ten_Commandments#Islam \"Ten Commandments\")\n  * [Tawrat](/wiki/Torah_in_Islam \"Torah in Islam\")\n  * [Ṣuḥuf Mūsā](/wiki/Scrolls_of_Moses \"Scrolls of Moses\")\n  * [Biblical and Quranic narratives](/wiki/Biblical_and_Quranic_narratives#Moses_\\(Mūsā_ٰمُوسَى\\) \"Biblical and Quranic narratives\")\n  * [Prophets and messengers in Islam](/wiki/Prophets_and_messengers_in_Islam \"Prophets and messengers in Islam\")\n  * [Golden calf](/wiki/Golden_calf#Islamic_narrative \"Golden calf\")\n  * [Asiya](/wiki/Asiya \"Asiya\")\n\n  * [Balaam](/wiki/Balaam#Balaam_in_the_Quran \"Balaam\")\n  * [Samiri](/wiki/Samiri_\\(Islamic_figure\\) \"Samiri \\(Islamic figure\\)\")\n\n  * [Ulu'l azm prophets](/wiki/Ulu%27l_azm_prophets \"Ulu'l azm prophets\")\n\n  \n  \n  * [Category](/wiki/Category:Prophets_of_Islam \"Category:Prophets of Islam\")\n  * [Islam portal](/wiki/Portal:Islam \"Portal:Islam\")\n\n  \n  \n  * [v](/wiki/Template:Musa \"Template:Musa\")\n  * [t](/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Musa&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Template talk:Musa \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n  * [e](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Musa&action=edit)\n\n  \n  \nRegarding the **[Islamic](/wiki/Islam \"Islam\") view of Balaam**, no clear\nreference is made to Balaam in the [Qur'an](/wiki/Qur%27an \"Qur'an\"). However,\nthe commentators argue that he is the one to whom the following text is\nreferring:\n\n> Relate to them the story of the man to whom We sent Our signs, but he passed\n> them by: so Satan followed him up, and he went astray.  \n>  If it had been Our will, We should have elevated him with Our signs; but he\n> inclined to the earth, and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is\n> that of a dog: if you attack him, he lolls out his tongue, or if you leave\n> him alone, he (still) lolls out his tongue. That is the similitude of those\n> who reject Our signs; So relate the story; perchance they may reflect.\n>\n> — Qur'an, [sura](/wiki/Sura \"Sura\") 7 ([Al-A'raf](/wiki/Al-A%27raf\n> \"Al-A'raf\")), [ayat](/wiki/Ayah \"Ayah\") 175–176[19]\n\nThe [Muslim](/wiki/Muslim \"Muslim\") commentators explain that Balaam was a\n[Canaanite](/wiki/Canaan \"Canaan\") who had been given knowledge of some of the\nbooks of [God](/wiki/God_in_Islam \"God in Islam\"). His people asked him to\ncurse [Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\") ([Musa](/wiki/Islamic_view_of_Moses\n\"Islamic view of Moses\")) and those who were with him, but he said, \"How can I\ncurse one who has [angels](/wiki/Angel \"Angel\") with him?\" They continued to\npress him, however, until he cursed the [Israelites](/wiki/Israelites\n\"Israelites\"), and, as a consequence, they remained 40 years in the Wilderness\nof the Wanderings. Then, when he had cursed Moses, his tongue came out and\nfell upon his breast, and he began to pant like a dog.\n\nThe story as told by [Tabari](/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Jarir_al-Tabari \"Muhammad ibn\nJarir al-Tabari\")[20] is somewhat more [Biblical](/wiki/Bible \"Bible\"). Balaam\nhad the knowledge of the [Most Sacred Name of God](/wiki/Names_of_God \"Names\nof God\"), and whatever he asked of God was granted to him. The story of Balaam\nand the ass, then follows at length. When it came to the actual cursing, God\n\"turned his tongue\" so that the cursing fell upon his own people and the\nblessing upon Israel. Then his tongue came out and hung down on his breast.\nFinally, he advised his people to adorn and beautify their women and to send\nthem out to ensnare the Israelites. The story of the plague at [Baal-\npeor](/wiki/Heresy_of_Peor \"Heresy of Peor\") and of [Cozbi](/wiki/Cozbi\n\"Cozbi\") and [Zimri](/wiki/Zimri_\\(prince\\) \"Zimri \\(prince\\)\")[21] follows.\n\nAccording to another story which al-Tabari gives, Balaam was a renegade\nIsraelite who knew the Most Sacred Name, and to gain the things of this world,\nwent over to the Canaanites. [Al-Tha'labi](/wiki/Ahmad_ibn_Muhammad_al-\nTha%27labi \"Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tha'labi\")[22] adds that Balaam was\ndescended from Lot. He gives, too, the story of Balaam's dream, his being\nforbidden by God to curse Israel. Another version is that [Balak](/wiki/Balak\n\"Balak\"), the king of [Bal'a](/wiki/Bal%27a \"Bal'a\"), compelled Balaam to use\nthe Most Sacred Name against Israel. The curse fell automatically, and Moses,\nhaving learned from whence it came, entreated God to take from Balaam his\nknowledge of the Name and his faith. This being done, they went out from him\nin the form of a white dove.\n\n## Balaam and the Deir Alla\ninscription[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Balaam&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Balaam and the Deir Alla inscription\")]\n\nFurther information: [Deir Alla Inscription](/wiki/Deir_Alla_Inscription \"Deir\nAlla Inscription\")\n\nIn 1967, at [Deir Alla](/wiki/Deir_Alla \"Deir Alla\"), [Jordan](/wiki/Jordan\n\"Jordan\"), archaeologists found an inscription with a story relating visions\nof the seer of the gods Bala'am, son of Be'or, who may be the same Bala'am\nmentioned in [Numbers](/wiki/Book_of_Numbers \"Book of Numbers\") 22–24 and in\nother passages of the Bible. This Bala'am differs from the one in Numbers in\nthat rather than being a prophet of Yahweh he is associated with\n[Ashtar](/wiki/Ashtar-Chemosh \"Ashtar-Chemosh\"), a god named Shgr, and Shadday\ngods and goddesses.[23]\n\n_The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies_ describes it as \"the oldest example\nof a book in a West Semitic language written with the alphabet, and the oldest\npiece of Aramaic literature.\"[24] The inscription is datable to ca. 840–760\nBCE; it was painted in red and black inks, apparently to emphasize the text,\non fragments of a plastered wall: 119 pieces of inked plaster were recovered.\nAccording to the story in the inscription,[25] Balaam wakes up weeping and\ntells his people that the gods appeared to him in the night telling him about\na goddess threatening to destroy the land. She is to cover the sky and reduce\nthe world to complete darkness. Meindert Dijkstra suggests that \"the reticence\nof OT scholarship to take account of the text may be attributable to its\ndamaged state, the difficulty of reconstructing and reading it, and the many\nquestions it raises of script, language, literary form and religious\ncontent.\"[26]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Balaam&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Balak (parsha)](/wiki/Balak_\\(parsha\\) \"Balak \\(parsha\\)\")\n  * [Biblical archaeology](/wiki/Biblical_archaeology \"Biblical archaeology\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Balaam&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section:\nNotes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Mangold, Max.
