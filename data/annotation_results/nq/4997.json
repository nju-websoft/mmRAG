Despite\nwidespread concern about the impacts of gun violence on public health,\nCongress has prohibited the [Centers for Disease\nControl](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control \"Centers for Disease Control\")\n(CDC) from conducting research that advocates in favor of gun control.[20] The\nCDC has interpreted this ban to extend to all research on gun violence\nprevention, and so has not funded any research on this subject since 1996.[21]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Gun ownership\n    * 1.1 Self-protection\n  * 2 Suicides\n  * 3 Homicides\n  * 4 Accidental and negligent injuries\n  * 5 Violent crime\n    * 5.1 U.S. presidential assassinations and attempts\n    * 5.2 Other violent crime\n  * 6 Offenders\n    * 6.1 Vectors\n  * 7 Victims\n  * 8 Public policy\n    * 8.1 Access to firearms\n    * 8.2 Firearms market\n    * 8.3 Federal legislation\n    * 8.4 State legislation\n      * 8.4.1 Right-to-carry\n      * 8.4.2 Child Access Prevention (CAP)\n    * 8.5 Local restrictions\n  * 9 Prevention programs\n    * 9.1 Hotline\n    * 9.2 Gun safety parent counseling\n    * 9.3 Children\n    * 9.4 Community programs\n  * 10 Intervention programs\n    * 10.1 Gun buyback programs\n    * 10.2 Operation Ceasefire\n    * 10.3 Project Exile\n    * 10.4 Project Safe Neighborhoods\n    * 10.5 Americans for Responsible Solutions\n  * 11 Research limitations\n  * 12 See also\n  * 13 Notes and references\n  * 14 External links\n\n## Gun\nownership[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Gun ownership\")]\n\nThe [Congressional Research Service](/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service\n\"Congressional Research Service\") in 2009 estimated there were 310 million\nfirearms in the U.S., not including weapons owned by the military. Of these,\n114 million were handguns, 110 million were rifles, and 86 million were\nshotguns.[22] In that same year, the Census bureau stated the population of\npeople in the U.S. at 306 million.[23]\n\nAccurate figures for civilian gun ownership are difficult to determine.[24]\nWhile the number of guns in civilian hands has been on the increase, the\npercentage of Americans and American households who claim to own guns has been\nin long-term decline, according to the [General Social\nSurvey](/wiki/General_Social_Survey \"General Social Survey\"). It found that\ngun ownership by households has declined steadily from about half, in the late\n1970s and early 1980s, down to 32% in 2015. The percentage of individual\nowners declined from 31% in 1985 to 22% in 2014.[25] However, the Gallup\norganization has been performing similar polls for the same interval, and\nfinds that household ownership of firearms was approximately the same in 2013\nas it was in 1970 - 43%, and individual ownership numbers rose from 27% in\n2000, to 29% in 2013.[24] Pew found that fewer Americans are dying as a result\nof gun violence: In 1993, there were seven homicides using firearms for every\n100,000; by 2013, that figure had fallen to 3.6.[26]\n\nWhat the Pew research does not account for though, is that household firearms\nownership hit a high again in the 1993-1994 timeframe where household gun\nownership exceeded 50% according to Gallup polls. The Gallup polls further\nshow that household firearm ownership currently exceeds 40% and that the long-\nterm trend is a sharp decline in polling for stricter gun control laws.\nLastly, Gallup polling has consistently been over 65% against, when asking\nwhether there should be bans on possession of handguns.[27]\n\nGun ownership figures are generally estimated via polling, by such\norganizations as the [General Social Survey](/wiki/General_Social_Survey\n\"General Social Survey\") (GSS), [Harris Interactive](/wiki/Harris_Interactive\n\"Harris Interactive\"), and [Gallup](/wiki/Gallup_\\(company\\) \"Gallup\n\\(company\\)\"). There are significant disparities in the results across polls\nby different organizations, calling into question their reliability.[28] In\nGallup's 1972 survey, 43% reported having a gun in their home, while GSS's\n1973 survey resulted in 49% reporting a gun in the home; in 1993, Gallup's\npoll results were 51%, while GSS's 1994 poll showed 43%.[29] In 2012, Gallup's\nsurvey showed 47% of Americans reporting having a gun in their home,[30] while\nthe GSS in 2012 reports 34%.[29]\n\nIn 1997, estimates were approximately 44 million gun owners in the United\nStates. These owners possessed approximately 192 million firearms, of which an\nestimated 65 million were handguns.[31] A National Survey on Private Ownership\nand Use of Firearms (NSPOF), conducted in 1994, indicated that Americans owned\n192 million guns: 36% rifles, 34% handguns, 26% shotguns, and 4% other types\nof long guns.[31] Most firearm owners owned multiple firearms, with the NSPOF\nsurvey indicating 25% of adults owned firearms.[31] In the U.S., 11% of\nhouseholds reported actively being involved in [hunting](/wiki/Hunting\n\"Hunting\"),[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] with the remaining firearm owners having guns\nfor self-protection and other reasons. Throughout the 1970s and much of the\n1980s, the rate of gun ownership in the home ranged from 45-50%.[29] Rapid\nincreases in gun purchases characterized by exceptionally large crowds\naccruing at gun vendors and gun shows is consistently observed due to the\npossibility of increased gun control following highly publicized mass\nmurders.[32][33][34][35][36]\n\nGun ownership also varied across geographic regions, ranging from 25% rates of\nownership in the [Northeastern United States](/wiki/Northeastern_United_States\n\"Northeastern United States\") to 60% rates of ownership in the [East South\nCentral States](/wiki/East_South_Central_States \"East South Central\nStates\").[37] A [Gallup](/wiki/Gallup_\\(company\\) \"Gallup \\(company\\)\") poll\n(2004) indicated that 49% of men reported gun ownership, compared to 33% of\nwomen, and 44% of whites owned a gun, compared to only 24% of nonwhites.[38]\nMore than half of those living in rural areas (56%) owned a gun, compared with\n40% of suburbanites and 29% of those in urban areas.[38] More than half (53%)\nof Republicans owned guns, compared with 36% of political independents and 31%\nof Democrats.[38] One criticism of the GSS survey and other proxy measures of\ngun ownership, is that they do not provide adequate macro-level detail to\nallow conclusions on the relationship between overall firearm ownership and\ngun violence.[39] [Kleck](/wiki/Gary_Kleck \"Gary Kleck\") compared various\nsurvey and proxy measures and found no correlation between overall firearm\nownership and gun violence.[40][41] In contrast, studies by [David\nHemenway](/wiki/David_Hemenway \"David Hemenway\") and his colleagues, which\nused GSS data and the fraction of suicides committed with a gun as a proxy for\ngun ownership rates, found a strong positive association between gun ownership\nand homicide in the United States.[42][43] Similarly, a 2006 study by [Philip\nJ. Cook](/wiki/Philip_J._Cook \"Philip J. Cook\") and [Jens\nLudwig](/wiki/Jens_Ludwig_\\(economist\\) \"Jens Ludwig \\(economist\\)\"), which\nalso used the percent of suicides committed with a gun as a proxy, found that\ngun prevalence increased homicide rates. This study also found that the\nelasticity of this effect was between +0.1 and +0.3.[44]\n\n### Self-\nprotection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Self-protection\")]\n\nMain article: [Defensive gun use](/wiki/Defensive_gun_use \"Defensive gun use\")\n\nThe effectiveness and safety of guns used for personal defense is debated.\nStudies place the instances of guns used in personal defense as low as 65,000\ntimes per year, and as high as 2.5 million times per year. Under President\nClinton, the Department of Justice conducted a survey in 1994 that placed the\nusage rate of guns used in personal defense at 1.5 million times per year, but\nnoted this was likely to be an overestimate.[41]\n\nBetween 1987 and 1990, [McDowall](/wiki/David_McDowall_\\(criminologist\\)\n\"David McDowall \\(criminologist\\)\") et al. found that guns were used in\ndefense during a crime incident 64,615 times annually (258,460 times total\nover the whole period).[45] This equated to two times out of 1,000 criminal\nincidents (0.2%) that occurred in this period, including criminal incidents\nwhere no guns were involved at all.[45] For violent crimes,\n[assault](/wiki/Assault \"Assault\"), [robbery](/wiki/Robbery \"Robbery\"), and\n[rape](/wiki/Rape \"Rape\"), guns were used 0.83% of the time in self-\ndefense.[45] Of the times that guns were used in self-defense, 71% of the\ncrimes were committed by strangers, with the rest of the incidents evenly\ndivided between offenders that were acquaintances or persons well known to the\nvictim.[45] In 28% of incidents where a gun was used for self-defense, victims\nfired the gun at the offender.[45] In 20% of the self-defense incidents, the\nguns were used by [police officers](/wiki/Police_officer \"Police\nofficer\").[45] During this same period, 1987 to 1990, there were 46,319 gun\nhomicides,[46] and the [National Crime Victimization\nSurvey](/wiki/National_Crime_Victimization_Survey \"National Crime\nVictimization Survey\") estimated that 2,628,532 nonfatal crimes involving guns\noccurred.[45]\n\nMcDowall's study for the _[American Journal of Public\nHealth](/wiki/American_Journal_of_Public_Health \"American Journal of Public\nHealth\")_ contrasted with a 1995 study by [Kleck](/wiki/Gary_Kleck \"Gary\nKleck\") and Gertz, who found that 2.45 million crimes were thwarted each year\nin the U.S. using guns, and in most cases, the potential victim never fired a\nshot.[47] The results of the Kleck studies have been cited many times in\nscholarly and popular media.[48][49][50][51][52][53][54] The methodology of\nthe Kleck and Gertz study has been criticized by some researchers.[55]\n\n##\nSuicides[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Suicides\")]\n\nSee also: [Suicide methods § Firearms](/wiki/Suicide_methods#Firearms \"Suicide\nmethods\")\n\nThere were 19,392 firearm-related suicides in the U.S. in 2010.[10] The U.S.\nDepartment of Justice reports that approximately 60% of all adult firearm\ndeaths are by suicide, 61% more than deaths by homicide.[56] In the U.S.,\nfirearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for 51% of all\nsuicides committed in 2006.[57] One study found that military veterans used\nfirearms in about 67% of suicides in 2014.[58] Firearms are the most lethal\nmethod of suicide, with a lethality rate 2.6 times higher than suffocation\n(the second-most lethal method).[59]\n\nIn the United States, access to firearms is associated with an increased risk\nof completed suicide.[60] A 1992 case-control study in the _[New England\nJournal of Medicine](/wiki/New_England_Journal_of_Medicine \"New England\nJournal of Medicine\")_ showed an association between estimated household\nfirearm ownership and [suicide](/wiki/Suicide \"Suicide\") rates, finding that\nindividuals living in a home where firearms are present are more likely to\ncommit suicide than those individuals who do not own firearms, by a factor of\n3 or 4.[1][61] A 2006 study by researchers from the [Harvard School of Public\nHealth](/wiki/Harvard_School_of_Public_Health \"Harvard School of Public\nHealth\") found a significant association between changes in estimated\nhousehold gun ownership rates and suicide rates in the United States among\nmen, women, and children.[62] A 2007 study by the same research team found\nthat in the United States, estimated household gun ownership rates were\nstrongly associated with overall suicide rates and gun suicide rates, but not\nwith non-gun suicide rates.[63] A 2013 study reproduced this finding, even\nafter controlling for different underlying rates of suicidal behavior by\nstates.[64] A 2015 study also found a strong association between estimated gun\nownership rates in American cities and rates of both overall and gun suicide,\nbut not with non-gun suicide.[65] Correlation studies comparing different\ncountries do not always find a statistically significant effect.[66]:30 A 2016\ncross-sectional study showed a strong association between estimated household\ngun ownership rates and gun-related suicide rates among men and women in the\nUnited States. The same study found a strong association between estimated gun\nownership rates and overall suicide rates, but only in men.[67] During the\n1980s and early 1990s, there was a strong upward trend in adolescent suicides\nwith guns[68]:29 as well as a sharp overall increase in suicides among those\nage 75 and over.[69]\n\nDavid Hemenway, professor of health policy at Harvard University's School of\nPublic Health, and director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and\nthe Harvard Youth Violence Prevention Center, stated\n\n> Differences in overall suicide rates across cities, states and regions in\n> the United States are best explained not by differences in mental health,\n> suicide ideation, or even suicide attempts, but by availability of firearms.\n> Many suicides are impulsive, and the urge to die fades away. Firearms are a\n> swift and lethal method of suicide with a high case-fatality rate.[13]\n\nThere are over twice as many gun-related suicides than gun-related homicides\nin the United States.[70] Firearms are the most popular method of suicide due\nto the lethality of the weapon. 90% of all suicides attempted using a firearm\nresult in a fatality, as opposed to less than 3% of suicide attempts involving\ncutting or drug-use.[71] The risk of someone attempting suicide is also 4.8\ntimes greater if they are exposed to a firearm on a regular basis; for\nexample, in the home.Kellermann, A. L., & Reay, D. T. (1986). Protection or\nperil: An analysis of firearm-related deaths in the home.

Youths and [Hispanic](/wiki/Hispanic\n\"Hispanic\") and [African American](/wiki/African_American \"African American\")\nmales in the U.S. were the most represented, with the injury and death rates\ntripling for black males aged 13 through 17 and doubling for black males aged\n18 through 24.[68][73] The rise in [crack cocaine](/wiki/Crack_cocaine \"Crack\ncocaine\") use in cities across the U.S. is often cited as a factor for\nincreased gun violence among youths during this time period.[86][87][88]\n\nPrevalence of homicide and violent crime is higher in [statistical\nmetropolitan areas](/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area \"Metropolitan\nstatistical area\") of the U.S. than it is in non-metropolitan counties;[89]\nthe vast majority of the U.S. population lives in statistical metropolitan\nareas.[90] In [metropolitan areas](/wiki/United_States_metropolitan_area\n\"United States metropolitan area\"), the homicide rate in 2013 was 4.7 per\n100,000 compared with 3.4 in non-metropolitan\n[counties](/wiki/County_\\(United_States\\) \"County \\(United States\\)\").[91]\nMore narrowly, the rates of murder and non-negligent manslaughter are\nidentical in metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan counties.[92] In U.S.\ncities with populations greater than 250,000, the mean homicide rate was 12.1\nper 100,000.[93] According to FBI statistics, the highest per capita rates of\ngun-related homicides in 2005 were in D.C. (35.4/100,000), Puerto Rico\n(19.6/100,000), Louisiana (9.9/100,000), and Maryland (9.9/100,000).[94] In\n2017, according to the Associated Press, Baltimore broke a record for\nhomicides.[95]\n\nIn 2005, the 17 through 24 age group remains significantly over-represented in\nviolent [crime statistics](/wiki/Crime_statistics \"Crime statistics\"),\nparticularly homicides involving firearms.[96] In 2005, 17- through 19-year-\nolds were 4.3% of the overall\n[population](/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States \"Demographics of the\nUnited States\") of the U.S.[97] This same age group accounted for 11.2% of\nthose killed in firearm homicides.[98] This age group also accounted for 10.6%\nof all homicide offenses.[99] The 20- through 24-year-old age group accounted\nfor 7.1% of the population,[97] while accounting for 22.5% of those killed in\nfirearm homicides.[98] The 20 through 24 age group also accounted for 17.7% of\nall homicide offenses.[99] Those under age 17 are not overrepresented in\nhomicide statistics.

In the year of 2014,\nthousands of Americans were killed by guns. There was a total of 8,124 gun\nhomicides.[111] In 2015, there were 372 mass shootings and 33,636 deaths due\nto firearms in the U.S, while guns were used to kill about 50 people in the\nU.K.[106] More people are typically killed with guns in the U.S. in a day\n(about 85) than in the U.K. in a year.[106]\n\nDeadly mass shootings have resulted in considerable coverage by the media.\nThese shootings have represented 1% of all deaths using gun between 1980 and\n2008.[112] Although mass shootings have been covered extensively in the media,\nmass shootings account for a small fraction of gun-related deaths[17] and the\nfrequency of these events had steadily declined between 1994 and 2007. Between\n2007 and 2013, the rate of active shooter incidents per year in the US has\nincreased.[18][19]\n\nHandguns figured in the [Virginia Tech massacre](/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre\n\"Virginia Tech massacre\"), [Binghamton shootings](/wiki/Binghamton_shootings\n\"Binghamton shootings\"), [2009 Fort Hood\nshooting](/wiki/2009_Fort_Hood_shooting \"2009 Fort Hood shooting\"), [Oikos\nUniversity shooting](/wiki/Oikos_University_shooting \"Oikos University\nshooting\"), and [2011 Tucson shooting](/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting \"2011 Tucson\nshooting\").

In an experiment performed\nby Berkowitz and LePage in 1967, this “weapons effect” was examined.\nUltimately, when study participants were provoked their reaction was\nsubstantially more aggressive when a gun was visibly present in the room as\nopposed to a more benign object like a tennis racket.[113] Other similar\nexperiments like those conducted by Carson, Marcus-Newhall and Miller yield\nsimilar results. [114]Such results imply that the presence of a gun in an\naltercation could illicit an aggressive reaction which may result in the\ncommitting of a homicide. However, such a reaction has only been proved in an\nexperimental setting and there is no evidence that suggests this would be true\nin a practical or realistic setting.\n\n## Accidental and negligent\ninjuries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Accidental and negligent injuries\")]\n\nThe perpetrators and victims of accidental and negligent gun discharges may be\nof any age.

The five\nmain areas of focus were gun violence, risk factors, prevention/intervention,\ngun safety and how media and violent video games influence the public. They\nalso researched the area of accidental firearm deaths. According to this study\nnot only have the number of accidental firearm deaths been on the decline over\nthe past century but they now account for less than 1% of all unintentional\ndeaths, half of which are self-inflicted.[117]\n\n## Violent\ncrime[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Violent crime\")]\n\nSee also: [Gun violence in the United States by\nstate](/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state \"Gun violence in the\nUnited States by state\")\n\nIn the United States, areas with higher levels of gun ownership also have\nhigher rates of gun assault and gun robbery.[75]\n\n### U.S. presidential assassinations and\nattempts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: U.S. presidential assassinations and attempts\")]\n\nMain article: [List of United States presidential assassination attempts and\nplots](/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_assassination_attempts_and_plots\n\"List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots\")\n\nAt least eleven assassination attempts with firearms have been made on U.S.\npresidents (over one-fifth of all presidents); four were successful, three\nwith handguns and one with a rifle.\n\n[Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\") survived an earlier\nattack,[118] but was killed using a .44-caliber\n[Derringer](/wiki/Philadelphia_Derringer \"Philadelphia Derringer\") pistol\nfired by [John Wilkes Booth](/wiki/John_Wilkes_Booth \"John Wilkes\nBooth\").[119] [James A.

Despite bleeding from his chest, Roosevelt refused to\ngo to a hospital until he delivered the speech.[125] On February 15, 1933,\n[Giuseppe Zangara](/wiki/Giuseppe_Zangara \"Giuseppe Zangara\") attempted to\nassassinate president-elect [Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt \"Franklin Delano Roosevelt\"), who\nwas giving a speech from his car in Miami, Florida.[126] Although Roosevelt\nwas unharmed, Chicago mayor [Anton Cermak](/wiki/Anton_Cermak \"Anton Cermak\")\ndied in that attempt, and several other bystanders received non-fatal\ninjuries.[127]\n\nResponse to these events has resulted in federal legislation to regulate the\npublic possession of firearms. For example, the attempted assassination of\nFranklin Roosevelt contributed to passage of the [National Firearms Act of\n1934](/wiki/National_Firearms_Act \"National Firearms Act\"),[127] and the\n[Kennedy assassination](/wiki/Kennedy_assassination \"Kennedy assassination\")\n(along with [others](/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968#History \"Gun Control Act of\n1968\")) resulted in the [Gun Control Act of\n1968](/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968 \"Gun Control Act of 1968\"). The GCA is a\nfederal law signed by President Lyndon Johnson that broadly regulates the\nfirearms industry and firearms owners. It primarily focuses on regulating\ninterstate commerce in firearms by largely prohibiting interstate firearms\ntransfers except among licensed manufacturers, dealers, and importers. The\nassassination attempt on Ronald Reagan largely contributed to the passage of\nthe [Firearm Owners Protection Act](/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act\n\"Firearm Owners Protection Act\") in 1986.[128]\n\n### Other violent\ncrime[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Other violent crime\")]\n\nA quarter of [robberies](/wiki/Robbery \"Robbery\") of commercial premises in\nthe U.S. are committed with guns.[129] Fatalities are three times as likely in\nrobberies committed with guns than where other, or no, weapons are\nused,[129][130][131] with similar patterns in cases of family violence.[132]\nCriminologist [Philip J. Cook](/wiki/Philip_J._Cook \"Philip J.

Only\nsix studies controlled at least six statistically significant confounding\nvariables, and none of them showed a significant positive effect.

A report by the ATF released in 1999 found\nthat 0.4% of federally licensed dealers sold half of the guns used criminally\nin 1996 and 1997.[164][165] This is sometimes done through \"[straw\npurchases](/wiki/Straw_purchase \"Straw purchase\").\"[164] State laws, such as\nthose in [California](/wiki/California \"California\"), that restrict the number\nof gun purchases in a month may help stem such \"straw purchases.\"[164] States\nwith gun registration and licensing laws are generally less likely to have\nguns initially sold there used in crimes.[166] Similarly, crime guns tend to\ntravel from states with weak gun laws to states with strict gun\nlaws.[167][168][169] An estimated 500,000 guns are [stolen](/wiki/Theft\n\"Theft\") each year, becoming available to prohibited users.[157][162] During\nthe ATF's [Youth Crime Gun Interdiction\nInitiative](/wiki/Youth_Crime_Gun_Interdiction_Initiative \"Youth Crime Gun\nInterdiction Initiative\") (YCGII), which involved expanded tracing of firearms\nrecovered by law enforcement agencies,[170] only 18% of guns used criminally\nthat were recovered in 1998 were in possession of the original owner.[171]\nGuns recovered by police during criminal investigations were often sold by\nlegitimate retail sales outlets to legal owners, and then diverted to criminal\nuse over relatively short times ranging from a few months to a few\nyears,[100][171][172] which makes them relatively new compared with firearms\nin general circulation.[162][173]\n\n### Federal\nlegislation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Federal legislation\")]\n\nMain article: [Gun law in the United\nStates](/wiki/Gun_law_in_the_United_States \"Gun law in the United States\")\n\nThe first Federal legislation related to firearms was the [Second Amendment to\nthe United States\nConstitution](/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Second\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") ratified in 1791. For 143 years,\nthis was the only major Federal legislation regarding firearms. The next\nFederal firearm legislation was the [National Firearms\nAct](/wiki/National_Firearms_Act \"National Firearms Act\") of 1934, which\ncreated regulations for the sale of firearms, established\n[taxes](/wiki/Excise_tax_in_the_United_States \"Excise tax in the United\nStates\") on their sale, and required registration of some types of firearms\nsuch as [machine guns](/wiki/Machine_gun \"Machine gun\").[174]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\nassassinations, the [Gun Control Act of 1968](/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968\n\"Gun Control Act of 1968\") was enacted. This Act regulated gun commerce,\nrestricting [mail order](/wiki/Mail_order \"Mail order\") sales, and allowing\nshipments only to licensed firearm dealers. The Act also prohibited sale of\nfirearms to [felons](/wiki/Felony \"Felony\"), those under\n[indictment](/wiki/Indictment \"Indictment\"), [fugitives](/wiki/Fugitive\n\"Fugitive\"), [illegal aliens](/wiki/Alien_\\(law\\) \"Alien \\(law\\)\"),\n[drug](/wiki/Narcotics \"Narcotics\") users, those [dishonorably\ndischarged](/wiki/Military_discharge \"Military discharge\") from the\n[military](/wiki/Military_of_the_United_States \"Military of the United\nStates\"), and those in [mental institutions](/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital\n\"Psychiatric hospital\").[133] The law also restricted importation of so-called\n[Saturday night specials](/wiki/Saturday_night_special \"Saturday night\nspecial\") and other types of guns, and limited the sale of [automatic\nweapons](/wiki/Automatic_weapon \"Automatic weapon\") and [semi-automatic\nweapon](/wiki/Semi-automatic_weapon \"Semi-automatic weapon\") conversion\nkits.[164]\n\nThe [Firearm Owners Protection Act](/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act\n\"Firearm Owners Protection Act\"), also known as the McClure-Volkmer Act, was\npassed in 1986. It changed some restrictions in the 1968 Act, allowing\nfederally licensed gun dealers and individual unlicensed private sellers to\nsell at [gun shows](/wiki/Gun_show \"Gun show\"), while continuing to require\nlicensed gun dealers to require background checks.[164] The 1986 Act also\nrestricted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms from conducting\nrepetitive inspections, reduced the amount of record-keeping required of gun\ndealers, raised the burden of proof for convicting gun law violators, and\nchanged restrictions on convicted [felons](/wiki/Felony \"Felony\") from owning\nfirearms.[164]\n\nIn the years following the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968, people\nbuying guns were required to show [identification](/wiki/Identity_document\n\"Identity document\") and sign a statement affirming that they were not in any\nof the prohibited categories.[133] Many [states](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S.\nstate\") enacted [background check](/wiki/Background_check \"Background check\")\nlaws that went beyond the federal requirements.[175] The [Brady Handgun\nViolence Prevention Act](/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act \"Brady\nHandgun Violence Prevention Act\") passed by\n[Congress](/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States \"Congress of the United\nStates\") in 1993 imposed a waiting period before the purchase of a handgun,\ngiving time for, but not requiring, a background check to be made.[176] The\nBrady Act also required the establishment of a national system to provide\ninstant criminal background checks, with checks to be done by firearms\ndealers.[177] The Brady Act only applied to people who bought guns from\nlicensed dealers, whereas felons buy some percentage of their guns from [black\nmarket](/wiki/Black_market \"Black market\") sources.[172] Restrictions, such as\nwaiting periods, impose costs and inconveniences on legitimate gun purchasers,\nsuch as hunters.[162]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/AK47.jpg/250px-\nAK47.jpg)](/wiki/File:AK47.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AK47.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSemi-automatic versions of the [AK-47](/wiki/AK-47 \"AK-47\") [assault\nrifle](/wiki/Assault_rifle \"Assault rifle\") were affected under the 1994 ban\n\nThe [Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement\nAct](/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act \"Violent Crime\nControl and Law Enforcement Act\"), enacted in 1994, included the [Federal\nAssault Weapons Ban](/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban \"Federal Assault\nWeapons Ban\"), and was a response to public concern over [mass\nshootings](/wiki/Mass_murder \"Mass murder\").[178] This provision prohibited\nthe manufacture and importation of some semiautomatic firearms with certain\nfeatures relevant to military use such as a folding stock, pistol grip, flash\nsuppressor, and [magazines](/wiki/Magazine_\\(firearms\\) \"Magazine\n\\(firearms\\)\") holding more than ten rounds.[178] A [grandfather\nclause](/wiki/Grandfather_clause \"Grandfather clause\") was included that\nallowed firearms manufactured before 1994 to remain legal.

It\nwas passed in 1996, and became effective in 1997. The law does not exempt\npeople who use firearms as part of their duties, such as police officers or\nmilitary personnel with applicable criminal convictions; they may not carry\nfirearms.[182]\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of [Hurricane Katrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina\n\"Hurricane Katrina\"), police and National Guard units in New Orleans\nconfiscated firearms from private citizens in an attempt to prevent violence.\nIn reaction, [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\")\npassed the [Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of\n2006](/wiki/Disaster_Recovery_Personal_Protection_Act_of_2006 \"Disaster\nRecovery Personal Protection Act of 2006\") in the form of an amendment to\n[Department of Homeland\nSecurity](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security \"United States\nDepartment of Homeland Security\") Appropriations Act, 2007. Section 706 of the\nAct prohibits federal employees and those receiving federal funds from\nconfiscating legally possessed firearms during a disaster.[183]\n\nOn Jan. 5, 2016, President Obama unveiled his new strategy to curb gun\nviolence in America.

Right-to-\ncarry laws expanded in the 1990s as homicide rates from gun violence in the\nU.S. increased, largely in response to incidents such as the [Luby's\nshooting](/wiki/Luby%27s_shooting \"Luby's shooting\") of 1991 in Texas which\ndirectly resulted in the passage of a _[carrying concealed\nweapon](/wiki/Carrying_concealed_weapon \"Carrying concealed weapon\")_ , or\n_CCW_ , law in Texas in 1995.[188] As Rorie Sherman, staff reporter for the\n_National Law Journal_ wrote in an article published on April 18, 1994, \"It is\na time of unparalleled desperation about crime. But the mood is decidedly\n'I'll do it myself' and 'Don't get in my way.'\"[189]\n\nThe result was laws, or the lack thereof, that permitted persons to carry\nfirearms openly, known as _[open carry](/wiki/Open_carry \"Open carry\")_ ,\noften without any permit required, in 22 states by 1998.[190] Laws that\npermitted persons to carry concealed [handguns](/wiki/Handgun \"Handgun\"),\nsometimes termed a _concealed handgun license_ , _CHL_ , or _concealed pistol\nlicense_ , _CPL_ in some jurisdictions instead of _CCW_ , existed in 34 states\nin the U.S. by 2004.[1] Since then, the number of states with CCW laws has\nincreased; as of\n2014[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit),\nall 50 states have some form of CCW laws on the books.[191][192]\n\nEconomist [John Lott](/wiki/John_Lott \"John Lott\") has argued that right-to-\ncarry laws create a perception that more potential crime victims might be\ncarrying firearms, and thus serve as a\n[deterrent](/wiki/Deterrence_\\(psychological\\) \"Deterrence \\(psychological\\)\")\nagainst crime.[193] Lott's study has been criticized for not adequately\ncontrolling for other factors, including other state laws also enacted, such\nas [Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\")'s laws requiring background checks and\nwaiting period for handgun buyers.[194] When Lott's data was re-analyzed by\nsome researchers, the only statistically significant effect of concealed-carry\nlaws found was an increase in [assaults](/wiki/Assault \"Assault\"),[194] with\nsimilar findings by [Jens Ludwig](/wiki/Jens_Ludwig_\\(economist\\) \"Jens Ludwig\n\\(economist\\)\").[195] Lott and Mustard's 1997 study has also been criticized\nby [Paul Rubin](/wiki/Paul_Rubin \"Paul Rubin\") and Hashem Dezhbakhsh for\ninappropriately using a [dummy variable](/wiki/Dummy_variable_\\(statistics\\)\n\"Dummy variable \\(statistics\\)\"); Rubin and Dezhbakhsh reported in a 2003\nstudy that right-to-carry laws have much smaller and more inconsistent effects\nthan those reported by Lott and Mustard, and that these effects are usually\nnot crime-reducing.[196] Since concealed-carry permits are only given to\nadults, Philip J. Cook suggested that analysis should focus on the\nrelationship with adult and not [juvenile](/wiki/Juvenile_\\(law\\) \"Juvenile\n\\(law\\)\") gun incident rates.[133] He found no [statistically\nsignificant](/wiki/Statistical_significance \"Statistical significance\")\neffect.[133] A 2004 [National Academy of\nScience](/wiki/National_Academy_of_Science \"National Academy of Science\")\nsurvey of existing literature found that the data available \"are too weak to\nsupport unambiguous conclusions\" about the impact of right-to-carry laws on\nrates of [violent crime](/wiki/Violent_crime \"Violent crime\").[1] NAS\nsuggested that new analytical approaches and datasets at the county or local\nlevel are needed to adequately evaluate the impact of right-to-carry\nlaws.[197] A 2014 study found that Arizona's SB 1108, which allowed adults in\nthe state to concealed carry without a permit and without passing a training\ncourse, was associated with an increase in gun-related fatalities.[198] A 2015\n[NBER](/wiki/NBER \"NBER\") working paper found that the apparent effects of RTC\nlaws on crime rates depend significantly on the assumptions made in the\nanalysis.[199]\n\n#### Child Access Prevention\n(CAP)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Child Access Prevention \\(CAP\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Child access prevention law](/wiki/Child_access_prevention_law\n\"Child access prevention law\")\n\nChild Access Prevention (CAP) laws, enacted by many states, require parents to\nstore firearms safely, to minimize access by children to guns, while\nmaintaining ease of access by adults.[200] CAP laws hold gun owners\n[liable](/wiki/Legal_liability \"Legal liability\") should a child gain access\nto a loaded gun that is not properly stored.[200] The [Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention\n\"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\") (CDC) claimed that, on average,\none child died every three days in accidental incidents in the U.S. from 2000\nto 2005.[201] In most states, CAP law violations are considered\n[misdemeanors](/wiki/Misdemeanor \"Misdemeanor\").[200] [Florida](/wiki/Florida\n\"Florida\")'s CAP law, enacted in 1989, permits [felony](/wiki/Felony \"Felony\")\nprosecution of violators.[200] Research indicates that CAP laws are correlated\nwith a reduction in unintentional gun deaths by 23%,[202] and gun suicides\namong those aged 14 through 17 by 11%.[203] A study by [Lott](/wiki/John_Lott\n\"John Lott\") did not detect a relationship between CAP laws and accidental gun\ndeaths or suicides among those age 19 and under between 1979 and 1996.[204]\nHowever, two studies disputed Lott's findings.[203][205] A 2008 [National\nBureau of Economic Research](/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research\n\"National Bureau of Economic Research\") working paper found that CAP laws are\ncorrelated with a reduction of non-fatal gun injuries among both children and\nadults by 30-40%.[200] In 2016 the [American Academy of\nPediatrics](/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics \"American Academy of\nPediatrics\") found that safe gun storage laws were associated with lower\noverall adolescent suicide rates.[206] Research also indicated that CAP laws\nwere most highly correlated with reductions of non-fatal gun injuries in\nstates where violations were considered felonies, whereas in states that\nconsidered violations as misdemeanors, the potential impact of CAP laws was\nnot statistically significant.[207] All of these studies were correlational,\nand do not account for other potential contributing factors.\n\n### Local\nrestrictions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Local restrictions\")]\n\nSome local jurisdictions in the U.S. have more restrictive laws, such as\n[Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\")'s [Firearms\nControl Regulations Act of\n1975](/wiki/Firearms_Control_Regulations_Act_of_1975 \"Firearms Control\nRegulations Act of 1975\"), which banned residents from owning handguns, and\nrequired permitted firearms be disassembled and locked with a trigger lock. On\nMarch 9, 2007, a [U.S. Appeals Court](/wiki/Parker_v._District_of_Columbia\n\"Parker v.

The [Eddie Eagle](/wiki/Eddie_Eagle \"Eddie Eagle\") Gun Safety\nProgram, administered by the [National Rifle\nAssociation](/wiki/National_Rifle_Association \"National Rifle Association\")\n(NRA), is geared towards younger children from\npre-[kindergarten](/wiki/Kindergarten \"Kindergarten\") to sixth grade, and\nteaches kids that real guns are not toys by emphasizing a \"just say no\"\napproach.[210] The Eddie Eagle program is based on training children in a\nfour-step action to take when they see a firearm: (1) Stop! (2) Don't touch!\n(3) Leave the area. (4) Go tell an adult. Materials, such as coloring books\nand posters, back the lessons up and provide the repetition necessary in any\nchild-education program. The ineffectiveness of the \"just say no\" approach\npromoted by the NRA's Eddie the Eagle program was highlighted in an\ninvestigative piece by ABC's Diane Sawyer in 1999.[223] Sawyer's piece was\nbased on academic studies conducted by Dr. Marjorie Hardy, assistant professor\nof psychology at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania.[224] Dr.\nHardy's study tracked the behavior of elementary age schoolchildren who spent\na day learning the Eddie the Eagle four-step action plan from a uniformed\npolice officer. The children were then placed into a playroom which contained\na hidden gun. When the children found the gun, they did not run away from the\ngun, but rather, they inevitably played with it, pulled the trigger while\nlooking into the barrel, or aimed the gun at a playmate and pulled the\ntrigger. The study concluded that children's natural curiosity was far more\npowerful than the parental admonition to \"Just say no\".[225]\n\n### Community\nprograms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Community programs\")]\n\nPrograms targeted at entire [communities](/wiki/Community \"Community\"), such\nas community revitalization, after-school programs, and [media\ncampaigns](/wiki/Public_service_announcement \"Public service announcement\"),\nmay be more effective in reducing the general level of violence that children\nare exposed to.[226][227] Community-based programs that have specifically\ntargeted gun violence include Safe Kids/Healthy Neighborhoods Injury\nPrevention Program in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York\nCity\"),[228][229] and Safe Homes and Havens in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago\n\"Chicago\").[210] Evaluation of such community-based programs is difficult, due\nto many confounding factors and the multifaceted nature of such programs.[210]\nA Chicago-based program, \"BAM\" (Becoming a Man) has produced positive results,\naccording to the University of Chicago Crime Lab, and is expanding to Boston\nin 2017.[230]\n\n## Intervention\nprograms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Intervention programs\")]\n\n[Sociologist](/wiki/Sociology \"Sociology\") James D. Wright suggests that to\nconvince inner-city youths not to carry guns \"requires convincing them that\nthey can survive in their neighborhood without being armed, that they can come\nand go in peace, that being unarmed will not cause them to be victimized,\nintimidated, or slain.\"[16] Intervention programs, such as [CeaseFire\nChicago](/wiki/CeaseFire_\\(organization\\) \"CeaseFire \\(organization\\)\"),\n[Operation Ceasefire](/wiki/Operation_Ceasefire \"Operation Ceasefire\") in\n[Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\") and [Project Exile](/wiki/Project_Exile\n\"Project Exile\") in [Richmond, Virginia](/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia \"Richmond,\nVirginia\") during the 1990s, have been shown to be effective.[1][231] Other\nintervention strategies, such as gun \"buy-back\" programs have been\ndemonstrated to be ineffective.[232]\n\n### Gun buyback\nprograms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Gun buyback programs\")]\n\nMain article: [Gun buyback program](/wiki/Gun_buyback_program \"Gun buyback\nprogram\")\n\nGun \"buyback\" programs are a strategy aimed at influencing the firearms market\nby taking guns \"off the streets\".[232] Gun \"buyback\" programs have been shown\nto be effective to prevent suicides, but ineffective to prevent\nhomicides[233][234] with the [National Academy of\nSciences](/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences \"United States\nNational Academy of Sciences\") citing theory underlying these programs as\n\"badly flawed.\"[232] Guns surrendered tend to be those least likely to be\ninvolved in crime, such as old, [malfunctioning](/wiki/Firearm_malfunction\n\"Firearm malfunction\") guns with little resale value, muzzleloading or other\nblack-powder guns, antiques chambered for obsolete cartridges that are no\nlonger commercially manufactured or sold, or guns that individuals\n[inherit](/wiki/Inheritance \"Inheritance\") but have little value in\npossessing.[235] Other limitations of gun buyback programs include the fact\nthat it is relatively easy to obtain gun replacements, often of better guns\nthan were relinquished in the buyback.[232] Also, the number of handguns used\nin crime (approximately 7,500 per year) is very small compared to the\napproximately 70 million handguns in the U.S.. (i.e., 0.011%).[232]\n\n\"Gun bounty\" programs launched in several Florida cities have shown more\npromise. These programs involve cash rewards for anonymous tips about illegal\nweapons that lead to an arrest and a weapons charge. Since its inception in\nMay 2007, the Miami program has led to 264 arrests and the confiscation of 432\nguns owned illegally and $2.2 million in drugs, and has solved several murder\nand burglary cases.[236]\n\n### Operation\nCeasefire[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Operation Ceasefire\")]\n\nIn 1995, [Operation Ceasefire](/wiki/Operation_Ceasefire \"Operation\nCeasefire\") was established as a strategy for addressing youth gun violence in\nBoston. Violence was particularly concentrated in poor, inner-city\nneighborhoods including [Roxbury](/wiki/Roxbury,_Massachusetts \"Roxbury,\nMassachusetts\"), [Dorchester](/wiki/Dorchester,_Massachusetts \"Dorchester,\nMassachusetts\"), and [Mattapan](/wiki/Mattapan \"Mattapan\").[237] There were 22\nyouths (under the age of 24) killed in Boston in 1987, with that figure rising\nto 73 in 1990.[237] Operation Ceasefire entailed a [problem-oriented\npolicing](/wiki/Problem-oriented_policing \"Problem-oriented policing\")\napproach, and focused on specific places that were crime hot spots—two\nstrategies that when combined have been shown to be quite\neffective.[238][239][240] Particular focus was placed on two elements of the\ngun violence problem, including illicit gun trafficking[241] and [gang\nviolence](/wiki/Gang_violence \"Gang violence\").[237] Within two years of\nimplementing Operation Ceasefire in Boston, the number of youth homicides\ndropped to ten, with only one handgun-related youth homicide occurring in 1999\nand 2000[164] The Operation Ceasefire strategy has since been replicated in\nother cities, including [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\").[242]\nErica Bridgeford, spearheaded a \"72-hour ceasefire\" in August 2017, but the\nceasefire was broken with a homicide. Councilman Brandon Scott, Mayor\nCatherine Pugh and others talked of community policing models that might work\nfor Baltimore.[243][95]\n\n### Project\nExile[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Project Exile\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Psnlogo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Psnlogo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Psnlogo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFederally supported gun violence intervention program\n\n[Project Exile](/wiki/Project_Exile \"Project Exile\"), conducted in Richmond,\nVirginia during the 1990s, was a coordinated effort involving federal, state,\nand local officials that targeted gun violence. The strategy entailed\n[prosecution](/wiki/Prosecution \"Prosecution\") of gun violations in Federal\ncourts, where [sentencing guidelines](/wiki/Sentencing_guidelines \"Sentencing\nguidelines\") were tougher. Project Exile also involved outreach and education\nefforts through media campaigns, getting the message out about the\ncrackdown.[244] Research analysts offered different opinions as to the\nprogram's success in reducing gun crime. Authors of a 2003 analysis of the\nprogram argued that the decline in gun homicide was part of a \"general\nregression to the mean\" across U.S. cities with high homicide rates.[245]\nAuthors of a 2005 study disagreed, concluding that Richmond's gun homicide\nrate fell more rapidly than the rates in other large U.S. cities with other\ninfluences controlled.[244][246]\n\n### Project Safe\nNeighborhoods[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Project Safe Neighborhoods\")]\n\n[Project Safe Neighborhoods](/wiki/Project_Safe_Neighborhoods \"Project Safe\nNeighborhoods\") (PSN) is a national strategy for reducing gun violence that\nbuilds on the strategies implemented in Operation Ceasefire and [Project\nExile](/wiki/Project_Exile \"Project Exile\").[247] PSN was established in 2001,\nwith support from the [Bush\nadministration](/wiki/George_W._Bush_administration \"George W.

The [Federal\ngovernment](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal government\nof the United States\") has spent over [US$](/wiki/United_States_dollar \"United\nStates dollar\")1.5 billion since the program's inception on the hiring of\n[prosecutors](/wiki/Prosecutor \"Prosecutor\"), and providing assistance to\nstate and local jurisdictions in support of training and community outreach\nefforts.[248][249]\n\n### Americans for Responsible\nSolutions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Americans for Responsible Solutions\")]\n\nMain article: [Americans for Responsible\nSolutions](/wiki/Americans_for_Responsible_Solutions \"Americans for\nResponsible Solutions\")\n\nAmericans for Responsible Solutions was started in January 2013 as a [not-for-\nprofit organization](/wiki/Nonprofit_organization \"Nonprofit organization\")\nwhose mission is to \"encourage elected officials to stand up for solutions to\nprevent gun violence and protect responsible gun ownership by communicating\ndirectly with the constituents that elect them.\"[250] The organization was\nannounced on January 8, 2013 by [Gabrielle \"Gabby\"\nGiffords](/wiki/Gabrielle_Giffords \"Gabrielle Giffords\"), a former\n[Democratic](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party\n\\(United States\\)\") member of the [United States House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") for [Arizona's 8th congressional\ndistrict](/wiki/Arizona%27s_8th_congressional_district \"Arizona's 8th\ncongressional district\"), and [Mark Kelly](/wiki/Mark_Kelly \"Mark Kelly\"), a\nretired American [astronaut](/wiki/Astronaut \"Astronaut\").[251] In an [op-\ned](/wiki/Op-ed \"Op-ed\") published in [USA Today](/wiki/USA_Today \"USA\nToday\"), Gifford and Kelly referred to the\n[NRA](/wiki/National_Rifle_Association \"National Rifle Association\") lobby and\nsought to counter it by creating a lobby dedicated to responsible [gun\ncontrol](/wiki/Gun_control \"Gun control\") measures.[252]\n\n## Research\nlimitations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Research limitations\")]\n\nIn the United States, [research](/wiki/Research \"Research\") into firearms and\nviolent crime is fraught with difficulties, associated with limited\n[data](/wiki/Data \"Data\") on gun ownership and use,[37] firearms markets, and\naggregation of crime data.[1] Research studies into gun violence have\nprimarily taken one of two approaches: [case-control](/wiki/Case-control\n\"Case-control\") studies and [social\necology](/wiki/Social_ecology_\\(academic_field\\) \"Social ecology \\(academic\nfield\\)\").[1] Gun ownership is usually determined through\n[surveys](/wiki/Statistical_survey \"Statistical survey\"),\n[proxy](/wiki/Proxy_\\(statistics\\) \"Proxy \\(statistics\\)\") variables, and\nsometimes with [production](/wiki/Mass_production \"Mass production\") and\n[import](/wiki/Import \"Import\") figures. In statistical analysis of homicides\nand other types of crime which are rare events, these data tend to have\n[poisson distributions](/wiki/Poisson_distribution \"Poisson distribution\"),\nwhich also presents methodological challenges to researchers. With data\naggregation, it is difficult to make inferences about individual\nbehavior.[253] This problem, known as [ecological\nfallacy](/wiki/Ecological_fallacy \"Ecological fallacy\"), is not always handled\nproperly by researchers; this leads some to jump to conclusions that their\ndata do not necessarily support.[254]\n\nIn 1996 the NRA lobbied Congressman [Jay Dickey](/wiki/Jay_Dickey \"Jay\nDickey\") (R-Ark.) to include budget provisions that prohibited the Centers for\nDisease Control (CDC) from advocating or promoting gun control and that\ndeleted $2.6 million from the CDC budget, the exact amount the CDC had spent\non firearms research the previous year. The ban was later extended to all\nresearch funded by the [Department of Health and Human\nServices](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services \"United\nStates Department of Health and Human Services\") (DHHS). According to an\narticle in [Nature](/wiki/Nature_\\(journal\\) \"Nature \\(journal\\)\"), this made\ngun research more difficult, reduced the number of studies, and discouraged\nresearchers from even talking about gun violence at medical and scientific\nconferences. In 2013, after the December 2012 [Sandy Hook Elementary School\nshooting](/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting \"Sandy Hook Elementary\nSchool shooting\"), President [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\")\nordered the CDC to resume funding research on gun violence and prevention, and\nput $10 million in the 2014 budget request for it.[255] Prior to this, U.S.\npublic funding directed towards gun violence prevention was less than $2\nmillion annually, a disproportionately low total compared to public funding\ntotals for other leading public health burdens with respect to potential years\nof life lost.[256]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Crime in the United States](/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States \"Crime in the United States\")\n  * [Mass shootings in the United States](/wiki/Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States \"Mass shootings in the United States\")\n  * [Firearm death rates in the United States by state](/wiki/Firearm_death_rates_in_the_United_States_by_state \"Firearm death rates in the United States by state\")\n  * [Gun violence and gun control in Texas](/wiki/Gun_violence_and_gun_control_in_Texas \"Gun violence and gun control in Texas\")\n  * [Sullivan Law](/wiki/Sullivan_Law \"Sullivan Law\") of 1911, one of the broadest and oldest existing gun control laws in the United States.\n  * [Index of gun politics articles](/wiki/Index_of_gun_politics_articles \"Index of gun politics articles\")\n  * \"[Thoughts and prayers](/wiki/Thoughts_and_prayers \"Thoughts and prayers\")\"\n\n## Notes and\nreferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Notes and references\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ _**h**_ _**i**_ _**j**_ _**k**_ National Research Council (2004).
