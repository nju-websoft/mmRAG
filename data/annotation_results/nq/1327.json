From there, the aqueous\nhumour exits the eye through the [trabecular\nmeshwork](/wiki/Trabecular_meshwork \"Trabecular meshwork\") into [Schlemm's\ncanal](/wiki/Schlemm%27s_canal \"Schlemm's canal\") (a channel at the limbus,\ni.e., the joining point of the cornea and sclera, which encircles the\ncornea[5]) It flows through 25–30 collector canals into the episcleral veins.\nThe greatest resistance to aqueous flow is provided by the trabecular meshwork\n(esp. the juxtacanalicular part), and this is where most of the aqueous\noutflow occurs. The internal wall of the canal is very delicate and allows the\nfluid to filter due to high pressure of the fluid within the eye.[5] The\nsecondary route is the uveoscleral drainage, and is independent of the\nintraocular pressure, the aqueous flows through here, but to a lesser extent\nthan through the trabecular meshwork (approx. 10% of the total drainage\nwhereas by trabecular meshwork 90% of the total drainage).\n\nThe fluid is normally 15 mmHg (0.6 inHg) above atmospheric pressure, so when a\nsyringe is injected the fluid flows easily. If the fluid is leaking, due to\ncollapse and wilting of cornea, the hardness of the normal eye is therefore\ncorroborated.[5]\n\n## Clinical\nsignificance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aqueous_humour&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Clinical significance\")]\n\nMain article: [Glaucoma](/wiki/Glaucoma \"Glaucoma\")\n\n[Glaucoma](/wiki/Glaucoma \"Glaucoma\") is a progressive optic neuropathy where\nretinal ganglion cells and their axons die causing a corresponding visual\nfield defect. An important risk factor is increased [intraocular\npressure](/wiki/Intraocular_pressure \"Intraocular pressure\") (pressure within\nthe eye) either through increased production or decreased outflow of aqueous\nhumour.[6] Increased resistance to outflow of aqueous humour may occur due to\nan abnormal trabecular mesh work or to obliteration of the meshwork due to\ninjury or disease of the iris. However, increased interocular pressure is\nneither sufficient nor necessary for development of primary open angle\nglaucoma, although it is a major risk factor. Uncontrolled glaucoma typically\nleads to visual field loss and ultimately [blindness](/wiki/Blindness\n\"Blindness\").\n\n## Additional\nImages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aqueous_humour&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Additional Images\")]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Three_Main_Layers_of_the_Eye.png/120px-Three_Main_Layers_of_the_Eye.png)](/wiki/File:Three_Main_Layers_of_the_Eye.png)\n\nStructures of the eye labeled\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Three_Internal_chambers_of_the_Eye.png/117px-Three_Internal_chambers_of_the_Eye.png)](/wiki/File:Three_Internal_chambers_of_the_Eye.png)\n\nThis image shows another labeled view of the structures of the eye\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aqueous_humour&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Vitreous Humour](/wiki/Vitreous_humour \"Vitreous humour\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Aqueous_humour&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Vitreous and Aqueous Humor\"](http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/eye-vitreous-and-aqueous-humor#seoBlock).\n  2. **Jump up ^** _Human Physiology.

                "Document Content Analysis": "The document describes the chambers of the eye and the fluids that fill them, specifically mentioning the aqueous humor as filling the anterior and posterior chambers. It also discusses the cornea and its layers.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document mentions 'aqueous humor', 'anterior chamber', and 'posterior chamber', which directly relate to the query.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "The document does not specifically mention 'ciliary epithelium', but discusses 'aqueous humor' in relation to the eye chambers.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document provides information that the aqueous humor is located in the anterior and posterior chambers, which are parts of a cow's eye, implying its location in a general anatomical context but not explicitly linking it to the ciliary epithelium.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "Yes, the document explains where the aqueous humor is located within the eye, specifically in the anterior and posterior chambers.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Yes, it provides context about the function and flow of the aqueous humor in the eye.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "2",
                "Explanation": "The document directly addresses the query by identifying the chambers of the eye where the aqueous humor is located, which can be relevant for understanding the general anatomical placement of the aqueous humor in a cow's eye."
