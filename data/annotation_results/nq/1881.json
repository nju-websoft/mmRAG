Baby,\nthe younger of two daughters, plans to study economics in underdeveloped\ncountries and enter the [Peace Corps](/wiki/Peace_Corps \"Peace Corps\"). Her\nfather, Jake, is the doctor and friend of Max Kellerman, the resort\nproprietor. Baby develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor, Johnny\nCastle, and meets his cousin, Billy. The staff holds secret after-hours\nparties in their quarters, and Baby is surprised by their \"dirty dancing\".\nIntrigued, Baby receives a brief, impromptu dance lesson from Johnny.\n\nBaby discovers that Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson, is pregnant by\nRobbie Gould, a womanizing waiter who is cheating on Baby's older sister,\nLisa. Baby borrows money from her father to pay for Penny's illegal\n[abortion](/wiki/Abortion \"Abortion\") without explaining why. Penny eventually\naccepts the money but identifies another issue. Penny will miss her weekly\ndance performance if she goes for the abortion, forfeiting Penny's and\nJohnny's salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her.\nJohnny's scoffing overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist\nthat Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny teaches Baby the\n[mambo](/wiki/Mambo_\\(dance\\) \"Mambo \\(dance\\)\"), and the two spend several\nawkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually improves, and they develop\na romantic attraction.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/Dirty-dancing-coverx-\nlarge.jpg/220px-Dirty-dancing-coverx-large.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dirty-dancing-\ncoverx-large.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dirty-dancing-coverx-large.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA scene from the dancing finale[6][7]\n\nBilly takes Penny to an abortionist. Johnny's and Baby's performance is mostly\nsuccessful, although Baby is too nervous to accomplish the dance's climactic\nlift. Johnny and Baby return to Kellerman's and find Penny in agony. Billy\nexplains that the \"doctor\" turned out to be a back-alley hack. Baby brings her\nfather to help Penny. Johnny claims responsibility for her pregnancy out of\nfear that Penny will be fired if her relationship with Robbie is revealed.\nJake treats Penny but forbids Baby from associating with Johnny or his\nfriends. After Baby apologizes to Johnny for her father's behavior, they dance\nand have sex. Jake tells his family they will be leaving early for breakfast\nbut relents when they object. Baby continues to see Johnny despite her\nfather's warning. She pulls Johnny off the footpath when her father is nearby,\nand Johnny is hurt that she will not stand up for him. After Robbie taunts\nthem, Johnny assaults him.\n\nDue to his growing feelings for Baby, Johnny refuses payment for sex with\nanother guest, Vivian Pressman. Vivian has sex with Robbie in his cabin, and\nLisa accidentally interrupts them. When Vivian leaves the cabin the next\nmorning, she sees Baby leave Johnny's cabin. Over breakfast, Max and Neil\nKellerman reveal to the Housemans that Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen.\nVivian accuses Johnny of the theft in a fit of jealousy. Johnny is unable to\nprovide a verifiable alibi, to protect his relationship with Baby. To save\nJohnny from being fired, Baby confesses she was with him. Johnny is cleared of\nthe theft after it is revealed that two elderly guests, Mr. and Mrs.\nSchumacher, stole several guests' wallets. Max fires Johnny anyway for having\na fraternizing affair with Baby. Baby and Johnny embrace and bid farewell to\neach other, saying they will never regret their affair. Baby pointedly\napologizes to Jake for lying about her relationship with Johnny but not for\nthe relationship itself.\n\nBaby and her parents watch the end-of-season talent show. Jake gives Robbie a\ntip in an envelope. Robbie thanks Jake, willingly reveals that he got Penny\npregnant; Jake yanks the envelope back. Staff and guests (including Lisa) are\nsinging the closing song together when Johnny interrupts them to perform the\nlast dance of the season. Johnny leads Baby onstage and makes a brief speech\nabout how \"Frances\" has made him a better man. Baby and Johnny dance a more\nprovocative version of their mambo duet, and the other \"dirty dancers\" join\nin. Baby runs to Johnny and executes the elusive lift move they practiced. The\ndirty dancers pull guests from their seats to join in the celebration. Jake\napologizes to Johnny for thinking he got Penny pregnant and reconciles with\nBaby. All dance joyously to \"[(I've Had) The Time of My\nLife](/wiki/\\(I%27ve_Had\\)_The_Time_of_My_Life \"\\(I've Had\\) The Time of My\nLife\")\".\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Jennifer Grey](/wiki/Jennifer_Grey \"Jennifer Grey\") as Frances \"Baby\" Houseman\n  * [Patrick Swayze](/wiki/Patrick_Swayze \"Patrick Swayze\") as Johnny Castle\n  * [Cynthia Rhodes](/wiki/Cynthia_Rhodes \"Cynthia Rhodes\") as Penny Johnson\n  * [Jerry Orbach](/wiki/Jerry_Orbach \"Jerry Orbach\") as Doctor Jake Houseman\n  * [Jane Brucker](/wiki/Jane_Brucker \"Jane Brucker\") as Lisa Houseman\n  * [Jack Weston](/wiki/Jack_Weston \"Jack Weston\") as Max Kellerman\n  * [Lonny Price](/wiki/Lonny_Price \"Lonny Price\") as Neil Kellerman\n  * [Kelly Bishop](/wiki/Kelly_Bishop \"Kelly Bishop\") as Marjorie Houseman\n  * [Antone Pagán](/w/index.php?title=Antone_Pag%C3%A1n&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Antone Pagán \\(page does not exist\\)\") as The Staff Kid\n  * [Max Cantor](/wiki/Max_Cantor \"Max Cantor\") as Robbie Gould\n  * [Charles Coles](/wiki/Charles_Coles \"Charles Coles\") as Tito Suarez\n  * [Neal Jones](/wiki/Neal_Jones \"Neal Jones\") as Billy Kostecki\n  * [Miranda Garrison](/wiki/Miranda_Garrison \"Miranda Garrison\") as Vivian Pressman\n  * [Garry Goodrow](/wiki/Garry_Goodrow \"Garry Goodrow\") as Moe Pressman\n  * [Wayne Knight](/wiki/Wayne_Knight \"Wayne Knight\") as Stan\n  * [Paula Trueman](/wiki/Paula_Trueman \"Paula Trueman\") as Mrs. Schumacher\n  * Alvin Myerovich as Mr. Schumacher\n\n## Soundtrack[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Soundtrack\")]\n\n  1. \"[Be My Baby](/wiki/Be_My_Baby \"Be My Baby\")\" – [The Ronettes](/wiki/The_Ronettes \"The Ronettes\")\n  2. \"[Big Girls Don't Cry](/wiki/Big_Girls_Don%27t_Cry_\\(The_Four_Seasons_song\\) \"Big Girls Don't Cry \\(The Four Seasons song\\)\")\" – [Frankie Valli](/wiki/Frankie_Valli \"Frankie Valli\") and [The Four Seasons](/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_\\(band\\) \"The Four Seasons \\(band\\)\")\n  3. \"Where Are You Tonight?\" – [Tom Johnston](/wiki/Tom_Johnston_\\(musician\\) \"Tom Johnston \\(musician\\)\")\n  4. \"[Do You Love Me](/wiki/Do_You_Love_Me \"Do You Love Me\")\" – [The Contours](/wiki/The_Contours \"The Contours\")\n  5. \"[Love Man](/wiki/Love_Man \"Love Man\")\" – [Otis Redding](/wiki/Otis_Redding \"Otis Redding\")\n  6. \"[Stay](/wiki/Stay_\\(Maurice_Williams_song\\) \"Stay \\(Maurice Williams song\\)\")\" – [Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs](/wiki/Maurice_Williams_and_the_Zodiacs \"Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs\")\n  7. \"[Hungry Eyes](/wiki/Hungry_Eyes \"Hungry Eyes\")\" – [Eric Carmen](/wiki/Eric_Carmen \"Eric Carmen\")\n  8. \"Overload\" – [Zappacosta](/wiki/Zappacosta \"Zappacosta\")\n  9. \"[Hey!

In 1980, Bergstein wrote a screenplay\nfor the [Michael Douglas](/wiki/Michael_Douglas \"Michael Douglas\") film,\n_[It's My Turn](/wiki/It%27s_My_Turn_\\(film\\) \"It's My Turn \\(film\\)\")_.\nHowever, the producers cut an erotic dancing scene from the script, much to\nher dismay. She then conceived a new story, focused almost exclusively on\ndancing. In 1984, she pitched the idea to [MGM](/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\") executive Eileen Miselle, who liked it and teamed\nBergstein with producer Linda Gottlieb. They set the film in 1963, with the\ncharacter of Baby based on Bergstein's own life, and the character of Johnny\nbased on the stories of [Michael Terrace](/wiki/Michael_Terrace \"Michael\nTerrace\"), a dance instructor whom Bergstein met in the Catskills in 1985\nwhile she was researching the story.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] She\nfinished the script in November 1985, but management changes at MGM put the\nscript into [turnaround](/wiki/Turnaround_\\(filmmaking\\) \"Turnaround\n\\(filmmaking\\)\"), or limbo.\n\nBergstein then shopped the script around to other studios but was repeatedly\nrejected, until she brought it to Vestron Pictures, the newly formed studio\ndivision of [Stamford, Connecticut](/wiki/Stamford,_Connecticut \"Stamford,\nConnecticut\"), based Vestron Inc., the leading independent home video\ndistribution company.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb\nand Bergstein chose [Emile Ardolino](/wiki/Emile_Ardolino \"Emile Ardolino\") as\nthe film's director, who had won the 1983 [Academy\nAward](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Documentary_Feature \"Academy Award for\nDocumentary Feature\") for the documentary, _[He Makes Me Feel Like\nDancin'](/wiki/He_Makes_Me_Feel_Like_Dancin%27 \"He Makes Me Feel Like\nDancin'\")_. Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely\npassionate about the project; he even sent a message from where he was\nsequestered on jury duty, insisting that he was the best choice as director.\nThe team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for\nthe film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice\npresident for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting,\nPeisinger had greenlighted the project to become Vestron's first feature film\nproduction. The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $5\nmillion, at a time when the average cost for a film was $12 million.[9]\n\nFor choreographer, Bergstein chose [Kenny Ortega](/wiki/Kenny_Ortega \"Kenny\nOrtega\"), who had been trained by [Gene Kelly](/wiki/Gene_Kelly \"Gene\nKelly\").[10] For a location, they did not find anything suitable in the\nCatskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they\ndecided on a combination of two locations: [Lake Lure, North\nCarolina](/wiki/Lake_Lure,_North_Carolina \"Lake Lure, North Carolina\") and the\n[Mountain Lake Hotel](/wiki/Mountain_Lake_Hotel_\\(Virginia\\) \"Mountain Lake\nHotel \\(Virginia\\)\") near [Pembroke, Virginia](/wiki/Pembroke,_Virginia\n\"Pembroke, Virginia\"), and with careful editing made it look like all shooting\nwas done in the same area.[11]\n\n### Casting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\nDirector Ardolino was adamant that they choose dancers who could also act, as\nhe did not want to use the \"stand-in\" method that had been used with\n_[Flashdance](/wiki/Flashdance \"Flashdance\")_ (1983). For the female lead of\nFrances \"Baby\" Houseman, Bergstein chose the 26-year-old [Jennifer\nGrey](/wiki/Jennifer_Grey \"Jennifer Grey\"), daughter of the Oscar-winning\nactor and dancer [Joel Grey](/wiki/Joel_Grey \"Joel Grey\") (_e.g._ , of the\nfilm _[Cabaret](/wiki/Cabaret_\\(1972_film\\) \"Cabaret \\(1972 film\\)\")_ (1972)),\nwho, like her father, was a trained dancer. They then sought a male lead,\ninitially considering 20-year-old [Billy Zane](/wiki/Billy_Zane \"Billy Zane\"),\nwho had the visual look desired (originally the Johnny character was to be\nItalian and have a dark exotic look), but initial dancing tests when he was\npartnered with Grey did not meet expectations. The next choice was 34-year-old\n[Patrick Swayze](/wiki/Patrick_Swayze \"Patrick Swayze\"), who had been noticed\nfor his roles in _[Grandview, U.S.A.](/wiki/Grandview,_U.S.A. \"Grandview,\nU.S.A.\")_ (1984) and _[Red Dawn](/wiki/Red_Dawn \"Red Dawn\")_ (1984). He was a\nseasoned dancer, with experience from the [Joffrey\nBallet](/wiki/Joffrey_Ballet \"Joffrey Ballet\"). The producers were thrilled\nwith him, but his agent was opposed to the idea. However, Swayze read the\nscript, liked the multi-level character of Johnny, and took the part anyway,\nand Johnny was changed from being Italian to Irish. Grey was initially not\nhappy about the choice, as she and Swayze had difficulty getting along on _Red\nDawn_ , but when they did their dancing screen test, the chemistry between\nthem was obvious. Bergstein described it as \"breathtaking\".[12]\n\nOther casting choices were [Broadway](/wiki/Broadway_theatre \"Broadway\ntheatre\") actor [Jerry Orbach](/wiki/Jerry_Orbach \"Jerry Orbach\") as Dr. Jake\nHouseman, Baby's father; and [Jane Brucker](/wiki/Jane_Brucker \"Jane Brucker\")\nas Lisa Houseman, her older sister. Bergstein also attempted to cast her\nfriend, sex therapist Dr. [Ruth Westheimer](/wiki/Ruth_Westheimer \"Ruth\nWestheimer\"), to play Mrs. Schumacher, and [Joel Grey](/wiki/Joel_Grey \"Joel\nGrey\") as her husband. However, Westheimer backed out when she learned the\nrole involved being a thief. The role went instead to 89-year-old [Paula\nTrueman](/wiki/Paula_Trueman \"Paula Trueman\"), and Joel Grey was not cast.\nAnother role went to Bergstein's friend, New York radio personality [\"Cousin\nBrucie\"](/wiki/Bruce_Morrow \"Bruce Morrow\"). She initially wanted him to\nportray the social director but then later asked him to play the part of the\nmagician. The role of the social director went to the then unknown [Wayne\nKnight](/wiki/Wayne_Knight \"Wayne Knight\") (of later\n_[Seinfeld](/wiki/Seinfeld \"Seinfeld\")_ and _[3rd Rock from the\nSun](/wiki/3rd_Rock_from_the_Sun \"3rd Rock from the Sun\")_ fame).[13] The part\nof Baby's mother was originally given to [Lynne Lipton](/wiki/Lynne_Lipton\n\"Lynne Lipton\"), who is briefly visible in the beginning, when the Houseman\nfamily first pulls into Kellerman's (she is in the front seat for a few\nseconds; her blonde hair is the only indication), but she became ill during\nthe first week of shooting and was replaced by actress [Kelly\nBishop](/wiki/Kelly_Bishop \"Kelly Bishop\"), who had already been cast to play\nVivian Pressman, the highly sexed resort guest. Bishop moved into the role of\nMrs. Houseman, and the film's assistant choreographer [Miranda\nGarrison](/wiki/Miranda_Garrison \"Miranda Garrison\") took on the role of\nVivian.[14][15]\n\n### Filming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Otrada4.JPG/220px-\nOtrada4.JPG)](/wiki/File:Otrada4.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Otrada4.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA typical family resort in the [Catskill Mountains](/wiki/Catskill_Mountains\n\"Catskill Mountains\")\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\nfor _Dirty Dancing_ took place in [Lake Lure, North\nCarolina](/wiki/Lake_Lure,_North_Carolina \"Lake Lure, North Carolina\"), and\n[Mountain Lake, Virginia](/wiki/Mountain_Lake_\\(Virginia\\) \"Mountain Lake\n\\(Virginia\\)\"). Scenes in Lake Lure were filmed at the old Boys Camp, which is\nnow a private, residential community known as Firefly Cove. These scenes\nincluded the interior dancing scenes, Baby carrying the watermelon and\npracticing on the signature stairs, Johnny's cabin, the staff cabins, the golf\nscene where Baby asks her father for $250. Scenes filmed at Mountain Lake\nincluded the famous \"water lift\" scene, dining scenes, Kellerman's Hotel, the\nbeach games, Penny crying in the kitchen, and the Houseman family's\ncabins.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nThe tight schedule allowed only two weeks for rehearsal and 44 days for\nfilming, as it was already the tail end of summer. The cast stayed in the same\nhotel at Mountain Lake Lodge in [Pembroke, Virginia](/wiki/Pembroke,_Virginia\n\"Pembroke, Virginia\") and at the 1927 Lake Lure Inn & Spa in [Lake\nLure](/wiki/Lake_Lure \"Lake Lure\"), N.C. Rehearsals quickly turned into disco\nparties involving nearly every cast member, even non-dancers such as [Jack\nWeston](/wiki/Jack_Weston \"Jack Weston\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe dancing and drinking went on almost non-stop and, immersed in the\nenvironment, the lead actors, Grey and Swayze, began identifying with their\ncharacters. Bergstein built upon this, encouraging the actors to improvise in\ntheir scenes. She also built the sexual tension by saying that no matter how\nintimate or \"grinding\" the dance steps, that none of the dancers were to have\nany other kind of physical contact with each other for the next six\nmonths.[12]\n\nFilming started on September 5, 1986 but was plagued by the weather, which\nranged from pouring rain to sweltering heat. The outside temperature rose to\n105 °F (41 °C), and with all the additional camera and lighting equipment\nneeded for filming, the temperature inside could be as high as 120 °F (49 °C).\nAccording to choreographer Kenny Ortega, on one day 10 people passed out\nwithin 25 minutes of shooting. The elderly Paula Trueman collapsed and was\ntaken to the local emergency room to be treated for dehydration. Patrick\nSwayze also required a hospital visit; insisting on doing his own stunts, he\nrepeatedly fell off the log during the \"balancing\" scene and injured his knee\nso badly he had to have fluid drained from the swelling.[12]\n\nDelays in the shooting schedule pushed filming into the autumn, which required\nthe set decorators to spray-paint the autumn leaves green. The uncooperative\nweather then took a different turn, plunging from oppressive heat to down near\n40 °F (4 °C), causing frigid conditions for the famous swimming scene in\nOctober. The crew wore warm coats, gloves, and boots. Swayze and Grey stripped\ndown to light summer clothing, to repeatedly dive into the cold water.[11]\nDespite her character's enjoyment, Grey later described the water as\n\"horrifically\" cold, and she might not have gone into the lake, except that\nshe was \"young and hungry\".[14]\n\nRelations between the two main stars varied throughout production. They had\nalready had trouble getting along in their previous project, _[Red\nDawn](/wiki/Red_Dawn \"Red Dawn\")_ (1984), and worked things out enough to have\nan extremely positive screen test, but that initial cooperation soon faded,\nand they were soon \"facing off\" before every scene.[12] There was concern\namong the production staff that the animosity between the two stars would\nendanger the filming of the love scenes. To address this, producer Bergstein\nand director Ardolino forced the stars to re-watch their initial screen-\ntests—the ones with the \"breathtaking\" chemistry. This had the desired effect,\nand Swayze and Grey were able to return to the film with renewed energy and\nenthusiasm.[14]\n\nDirector Ardolino encouraged the actors to improvise and often kept the\ncameras rolling, even if actors went \"off script\". One example of this was the\nscene where Grey was to stand in front of Swayze with her back to him and put\nher arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar\nto the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and\ntender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop\ngiggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked\nfor. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior\nannoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it\ninto the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression.\nIt became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as\nchoreographer Kenny Ortega put it, \"as one of the most delicate and honest\nmoments in the film.\"[12]\n\n### Post-\nproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Post-production\")]\n\nThe shooting [wrapped](/wiki/Wrap_\\(film_industry\\) \"Wrap \\(film industry\\)\")\non October 27, 1986, both on-time and on-budget. No one on the team, however,\nliked the rough cut that was put together, and Vestron executives were\nconvinced the film was going to be a flop. Thirty-nine percent of people who\nviewed the film did not realize abortion was the subplot. In May 1987, the\nfilm was screened for producer [Aaron Russo](/wiki/Aaron_Russo \"Aaron Russo\").\nAccording to Vestron executive Mitchell Cannold, Russo's reaction at the end\nwas to say simply, \"Burn the negative, and collect the insurance.\"[12]\n\nFurther disputes arose over whether a corporate sponsor could be found to\npromote the film. Marketers of the [Clearasil](/wiki/Clearasil \"Clearasil\")\nacne product liked the film, seeing it as a vehicle to reach a teen target\naudience. However, when they learned the film contained an abortion scene,\nthey asked for that part of the plot to be cut. As Bergstein refused, the\nClearasil promotion was dropped. Consequently, Vestron promoted the film\nthemselves and set the premiere on August 16, 1987. The Vestron executives had\nplanned to release the film in theaters for a weekend, and then send it to\nhome video, since Vestron had been in the video distribution business before\nfilm production.[6] Considering how many people disliked the film at that\npoint, producer Gottlieb's recollection of her feelings at the time was, \"I\nwould have only been grateful, _if_ when it was released, people didn't yell\nat me.\"[12]\n\n## Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\n### Critical\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Critical response\")]\n\nReview aggregator [Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\")\ngives the film a rating of 72% based on reviews from 61 critics and a rating\naverage of 6.1/10.

By November, it was also\nachieving international fame. Within seven months of release, it had brought\nin $63 million in the US and boosted attendance in dance classes across\nAmerica.[12] It was one of the highest-grossing films of 1987, earning $170\nmillion worldwide.[26][27]\n\nThe film's popularity continued to grow after its initial release. It was the\nnumber one video rental of 1988[28] and became the first film to sell a\nmillion copies on video. When the film was re-released in 1997, ten years\nafter its original release, Swayze received his own star on the [Hollywood\nWalk of Fame](/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame \"Hollywood Walk of Fame\"),[29] and\nvideos were still selling at the rate of over 40,000 per month.[29] As of\n2005[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit),\nit was selling a million DVDs per year,[30] with over ten million copies sold\nas of\n2007[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit).[31]\n\nA May 2007 survey by Britain's [Sky Movies](/wiki/Sky_Movies \"Sky Movies\")\nlisted _Dirty Dancing_ as number one on \"Women's most-watched films\", above\nthe [_Star Wars_ trilogy](/wiki/Star_Wars#Original_trilogy \"Star Wars\"),\n_[Grease](/wiki/Grease_\\(film\\) \"Grease \\(film\\)\")_ , _[The Sound of\nMusic](/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_\\(film\\) \"The Sound of Music \\(film\\)\")_ , and\n_[Pretty Woman](/wiki/Pretty_Woman \"Pretty Woman\")_.[32] The film's popularity\nhas also caused it to be called \"the _Star Wars_ for girls.\"[7][33][34] An\nApril 2008 article in Britain's _[Daily Mail](/wiki/Daily_Mail \"Daily Mail\")_\nlisted _Dirty Dancing_ as number one on a list of \"most romantic movie quotes\never\", for Baby's line: \"I'm scared of walking out of this room and never\nfeeling the rest of my whole life the way I feel when I'm with you.\"[35]\n\nThe film's music has also had considerable impact.

Ienner, who had previously produced albums and\nsongs for [John Lennon](/wiki/John_Lennon \"John Lennon\") and [Three Dog\nNight](/wiki/Three_Dog_Night \"Three Dog Night\"), opted to stick with much of\nthe music that had already been used during filming and obtained licenses for\nthe songs from Bergstein's collection. He also enlisted Swayze to sing the new\nsong \"[She's Like the Wind](/wiki/She%27s_Like_the_Wind \"She's Like the\nWind\")\". Swayze had written the song a few years earlier with Stacy Widelitz,\noriginally intending for it to be used in the film _[Grandview,\nU.S.A.](/wiki/Grandview,_U.S.A. \"Grandview, U.S.A.\")_ (1984).[12]\n\n[John Morris](/wiki/John_Morris_\\(composer\\) \"John Morris \\(composer\\)\")\ncomposed the film's score.

The series was canceled after only a few episodes.\n\n### Prequel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Prequel\")]\n\nIn 2004, a prequel of the film was released, entitled _[Dirty Dancing: Havana\nNights](/wiki/Dirty_Dancing:_Havana_Nights \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\")_.\nIt tells the story of a sheltered American teenager learning about life\nthrough dance, when her family relocates to Havana, Cuba just before the [1959\nCuban Revolution](/wiki/1959_Cuban_Revolution \"1959 Cuban Revolution\"). Swayze\nwas paid $5 million to appear in a cameo role as a dance teacher[67]\n—considerably more than the $200,000 he earned for the first film.[68]\n\n### 20th anniversary\nreleases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit\nsection: 20th anniversary releases\")]\n\nFor the 20th anniversary in 2007, the film was re-released in theatres with\nadditional footage, while the original film version was re-released on DVD\nwith deleted scenes, and included writer commentary.[69] At the same time,\nCodemasters released _Dirty Dancing: The Video Game_.[70] In the United\nKingdom, the anniversary was marked by a [reality TV](/wiki/Reality_TV\n\"Reality TV\") show based on the film; titled _[Dirty Dancing: The Time of Your\nLife](/wiki/Dirty_Dancing:_The_Time_of_Your_Life \"Dirty Dancing: The Time of\nYour Life\")_ , the TV show was filmed at the Mountain Lake resort.\n\nIn the UK, to mark the 20th anniversary of the film, Channel Five broadcast a\nspecial documentary called _Seriously Dirty Dancing_. It was presented by Dawn\nPorter, an investigative journalist and a self-confessed _Dirty Dancing_\naddict. The documentary was very successful, being Channel Five's highest\nrated documentary of 2007. Porter visited the set of the film, met other\n_Dirty Dancing_ fanatics, and learned the last dance, which she performed at\nthe end of the documentary in front of family and friends.\n\n## Remake[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: Remake\")]\n\nMain article: [Dirty Dancing (2017 film)](/wiki/Dirty_Dancing_\\(2017_film\\)\n\"Dirty Dancing \\(2017 film\\)\")\n\nIn August 2011, [Lionsgate](/wiki/Lionsgate \"Lionsgate\"), who owns the film\nrights, announced their plan to remake the film. It was confirmed that the\nstudio had hired the film's choreographer, [Kenny Ortega](/wiki/Kenny_Ortega\n\"Kenny Ortega\"), to direct. \"We believe that the timing couldn't be better to\nmodernize this story on the big screen, and we are proud to have Kenny Ortega\nat the helm,\" Joe Drake, president of Lionsgate's Motion Picture Group,\nexplained about the project. A miniseries version of \"Dirty Dancing\" had been\nscheduled to be shot in Western North Carolina.[71] As of July 29, 2015, the\nminiseries has been put on hold.[72]\n\nIn December 2015, [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American\nBroadcasting Company\") ordered a three-hour musical remake of _Dirty Dancing_\n, starring [Abigail Breslin](/wiki/Abigail_Breslin \"Abigail Breslin\"), Colt\nPrattes, [Debra Messing](/wiki/Debra_Messing \"Debra Messing\"), [Sarah\nHyland](/wiki/Sarah_Hyland \"Sarah Hyland\"), [Nicole\nScherzinger](/wiki/Nicole_Scherzinger \"Nicole Scherzinger\"), [Billy Dee\nWilliams](/wiki/Billy_Dee_Williams \"Billy Dee Williams\") & [Shane\nHarper](/wiki/Shane_Harper \"Shane Harper\").[73][74][75][76][77] It aired on\nMay 24, 2017.[4] It received negative reviews from a majority of critics.[78]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dirty_Dancing&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"_DIRTY DANCING_ (15)\"](http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/dirty-dancing-1970-7). _[British Board of Film Classification](/wiki/British_Board_of_Film_Classification \"British Board of Film Classification\")_.
