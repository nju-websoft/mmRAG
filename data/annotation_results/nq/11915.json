She always had a\nclose relationship with her mother, having been introduced to her love for\nbooks[9] and taught different skills such as how to translate fairy\nlanguage.[10] Belle also had a childhood friend by the name of Samuel.[11]\nHowever, besides this, not much else is known about Belle's life growing up.\nNearing adulthood, Belle is startled to learn that war is ready to break out\nbetween her father's kingdom and the ogres.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Belle_BTC_5x17.jpg/220px-\nBelle_BTC_5x17.jpg)](/wiki/File:Belle_BTC_5x17.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Belle_BTC_5x17.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBelle gets to know Gaston ([Wes Brown](/wiki/Wes_Brown_\\(actor\\) \"Wes Brown\n\\(actor\\)\")), her future betrothed.\n\nHer father arranges for her to marry [Sir\nGaston](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Gaston \"List of Once Upon a\nTime characters\") ([Wes Brown](/wiki/Wes_Brown_\\(actor\\) \"Wes Brown\n\\(actor\\)\")), a union that Belle openly objects, though she agrees to go out\non a walk with him and she surprisingly takes a liking to him. This all\nchanges when she finds him torturing a young ogre, but she reluctantly agrees\nto marry him once the war does officially break out.[12] At one point during\nthe war, Belle and her family are forced to flee their castle; however, she\nand her mother spend time packing up all of their important books. An ogre\nstorms the castle and kills Colette, and a traumatized Belle is left without\nany memory of the event. Desperate to know the truth, she travels to Arendelle\nwhere she meets [Princess Anna](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Anna\n\"List of Once Upon a Time characters\") ([Elizabeth Lail](/wiki/Elizabeth_Lail\n\"Elizabeth Lail\")).

However, due to an encounter with\nthe [Snow Queen](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Ingrid/Snow_Queen\n\"List of Once Upon a Time characters\") ([Elizabeth\nMitchell](/wiki/Elizabeth_Mitchell \"Elizabeth Mitchell\")), Belle loses the\nrock and returns home empty handed. Maurice confesses the truth to Belle,\nexplaining how Colette sacrificed herself to save her. This sets Belle on the\ntrack of becoming a hero, as she reveals to her father that on her trip she\nlearned of a man who could help them: [Rumplestiltskin](/wiki/Mr._Gold \"Mr.\nGold\") ([Robert Carlyle](/wiki/Robert_Carlyle \"Robert Carlyle\")).[9]\n\nRumplestiltskin agrees to protect Belle's kingdom if she agrees to leave her\nlife behind and live with him as his caretaker. Both Maurice and Gaston object\nto this, but Belle ignores their pleas and leaves with the Dark One. Belle is\nfrightened of Rumplestiltskin and his Dark Castle, as he shows her to her\n\"room\": a ghastly dungeon. Belle starts to see the softer side of her captor\nwhen she accidentally chips a teacup and he brushes it off as nothing.[13] At\none point during Belle's stay in the Dark Castle, she and Rumplestiltskin are\nvisited by an intruder, [Robin Hood](/wiki/Robin_Hood_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\)\n\"Robin Hood \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\") ([Tom Ellis](/wiki/Tom_Ellis_\\(actor\\) \"Tom\nEllis \\(actor\\)\")), who the Dark One proceeds to torture for trying to steal\nfrom him. Feeling compassion for the thief, Belle releases Robin in her\nmaster's absence. When Rumplestiltskin returns, he demands she accompany him\non his journey to find and kill the thief for stealing a magic wand from his\ncastle. When Belle and Rumple see that Robin had only stolen the wand to cure\nhis sick and [pregnant wife](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Marian\n\"List of Once Upon a Time characters\") ([Christie Laing](/wiki/Christie_Laing\n\"Christie Laing\")), Rumple spares the thief's life. Belle embraces\nRumplestiltskin in a hug, seeing that there's a man behind the beast, and he\nlater gifts her with a library.[14] It is implied that Belle and Robin Hood\nshare an encounter sometime in the future where Belle meets the thief in his\ntrue form ([Sean Maguire](/wiki/Sean_Maguire \"Sean Maguire\")).[15] Some time\nlater, Rumplestiltskin returns home one day with a stolen baby, which he\nleaves for Belle to take care of. She's appalled and frightened by whatever he\nplans to do with the child, and so she sets out to unveil his plans and save\nthe baby's life. Belle sneaks into Rumple's study and translates a scroll\nwritten in ancient fairy language. This, however, was all part of\nRumplestiltskin's plan, as he needed her to translate the text, and he locks\nher in the library. The [Blue\nFairy](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Reul_Ghorm/Blue_Fairy \"List\nof Once Upon a Time characters\") ([Keegan Connor\nTracy](/wiki/Keegan_Connor_Tracy \"Keegan Connor Tracy\")) subsequently frees\nBelle, and she finds Rumplestiltskin using the child to summon the [Black\nFairy](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Black_Fairy \"List of Once\nUpon a Time characters\") ([Jaime Murray](/wiki/Jaime_Murray \"Jaime Murray\")),\nhis mother. Belle is horrified by the Black Fairy's treatment of\nRumplestiltskin, but nonetheless chides him for stealing a child. She's later\ngiven permission to return the child to his parents, Jack (Nick Hunnings) and\nJill ([Tammy Gillis](/wiki/Tammy_Gillis \"Tammy Gillis\")).[10]\n\nBelle and Rumplestiltskin's bond is further explored when Belle is targeted by\nthe Queens of Darkness -\n[Maleficent](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Maleficent \"List of\nOnce Upon a Time characters\") ([Kristin Bauer van\nStraten](/wiki/Kristin_Bauer_van_Straten \"Kristin Bauer van Straten\")),\n[Ursula](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Ursula \"List of Once Upon a\nTime characters\") ([Merrin Dungey](/wiki/Merrin_Dungey \"Merrin Dungey\")), and\n[Cruella De Vil](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Cruella_De_Vil\n\"List of Once Upon a Time characters\") ([Victoria\nSmurfit](/wiki/Victoria_Smurfit \"Victoria Smurfit\")) - who ransom her for\nRumplestiltskin's enchanted gauntlet. The Dark One meets the three women at\nDemon's Bluff with the gauntlet, and is given no choice but to hand it over\nwhen Ursula threatens Belle's life. Once again, she sees something good in him\nbeneath the beast.[16] One day, Belle is sent out to the market in order to\npick up things for Rumplestiltskin when she stumbles upon her old friend\nSamuel, injured, so she brings him back to the Dark Castle to nurse him back\nto health. As it turns out however, he was only there to steal\nRumplestiltskin's dagger, giving him control over the Dark One, and so Belle\nbetrays him to protect Rumple.[11] As Belle and Rumple grow closer, his\nattitude towards her becomes more playful and lighthearted. Belle opens up\nRumple's nailed down curtains and even convinces him to share the story of his\n[lost son](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Baelfire \"List of Once\nUpon a Time characters\") (Dylan Schmid). The Dark One agrees to tell Belle\neverything if she returns home from town with straw, this being his subtle way\nof setting her free, having developed genuine feelings for her. Though Belle\nplans not to return at first, she runs into the [Evil\nQueen](/wiki/Regina_Mills \"Regina Mills\") ([Lana Parrilla](/wiki/Lana_Parrilla\n\"Lana Parrilla\")) on the road and learns that Rumplestiltskin's curse can be\nbroken with a kiss of true love. Realizing that she's in love with the Dark\nOne and that he loves her back, Belle returns and attempts to break his curse,\nonly for it to backfire when Rumplestiltskin learns it was the Queen's idea.\nHe lashes out at Belle and sends her back to the dungeon, and eventually kicks\nher out of his castle altogether. Belle argues that power won't be enough for\nRumple and that he is only doing this because he doesn't believe anyone could\ntruly love him. Before leaving, she says, \"Now, you've made your choice. And\nyou're going to regret it. Forever. All you'll have is an empty heart... and a\nchipped cup.\" [13][17]\n\nRather than return home to her friends and family, Belle spends some days in a\nlocal tavern where she meets a dwarf named\n[Dreamy](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Grumpy \"List of Once Upon a\nTime characters\") ([Lee Arenberg](/wiki/Lee_Arenberg \"Lee Arenberg\")). After\nconvincing him to go after his love ([Amy Acker](/wiki/Amy_Acker \"Amy\nAcker\")), he encourages her to seek out adventure and join a group of men on\nthe hunt for a beast known as the Yaoguai. She does so, but these men\nignorantly discredit a woman's ability to hunt and kick her off their wagon,\nso she sends them in the wrong direction and proceeds to hunt the creature\nherself. She winds up befriending a warrior named\n[Mulan](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Mulan \"List of Once Upon a\nTime characters\") ([Jamie Chung](/wiki/Jamie_Chung \"Jamie Chung\")), and she is\neventually able to track the Yaoguai down. However, as it turns out, this\nbeast has merely been trying to communicate with them. With the aid of some\nfairy dust given to her by Dreamy, Belle restores the creature to its true\nform: [Prince\nPhillip](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Prince_Phillip \"List of\nOnce Upon a Time characters\") ([Julian Morris](/wiki/Julian_Morris \"Julian\nMorris\")).

She's unable to\ndo so, however, when the Evil Queen arrives to take her captive. Belle vows\nthat the Queen cannot keep her and Rumple apart forever.[18][19] Regina visits\nRumple in his castle and convinces him that Belle was rejected by her father\nupon returning home and committed suicide by throwing herself off a tower,\nleaving him utterly heartbroken, while secretly Belle remains a prisoner in\nthe Queen's castle.[13] Belle is later sought out by [Captain\nHook](/wiki/Hook_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Hook \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\") ([Colin\nO'Donoghue](/wiki/Colin_O%27Donoghue \"Colin O'Donoghue\")), an old enemy of\nRumplestiltskin's who believes that the Dark One's former maid may know the\nkey to his undoing. Belle refuses to aid in his quest, so Hook knocks her\nunconscious and prepares to kill her, but Regina intervenes as she believes\nBelle to be a \"valuable chess piece\".[20] It is assumed that Belle remained in\nthe Queen's captivity until the casting of the First Curse.\n\n### Season\n1[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Belle_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Season 1\")]\n\nWhen the Evil Queen enacts a powerful Dark Curse that puts everyone in the\ntown of Storybrooke, Maine with false memories for the next 28 years, Belle\nspends that entire span of time locked away in the psychiatric ward beneath\nthe town's hospital. Unlike the other townspeople, Belle was left a blank\nslate and set to serve merely as a prisoner in order to keep her away from\nRumplestiltskin or, as he's known in Storybrooke, Mr. Gold. However, when time\nstarts moving again and Mr. Gold regains his memories of his past life in the\nEnchanted Forest, he forms a vendetta against Belle's father, believing he\ndrove her to suicide. Sheriff [Emma Swan](/wiki/Emma_Swan \"Emma Swan\")\n([Jennifer Morrison](/wiki/Jennifer_Morrison \"Jennifer Morrison\")) arrests\nGold when he beats Moe French nearly to death, but when behind bars, Regina\nreturns to him the chipped teacup in exchange for confirming to her that he\nknows the truth about the curse. She then proceeds to check up on a locked up\nBelle, who appears absolutely miserable.[21][13]\n\nAs the Dark Curse nears its end with the Savior beginning to believe in magic,\nthings start to fall apart for Regina. This includes her alliance with\n[Jefferson](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Jefferson/Mad_Hatter\n\"List of Once Upon a Time characters\"), the Mad Hatter ([Sebastian\nStan](/wiki/Sebastian_Stan \"Sebastian Stan\")), whom she refuses to hold up her\nend of a deal with after he procured her the poisoned apple she once used on\n[Snow White](/wiki/Mary_Margaret_Blanchard \"Mary Margaret Blanchard\")\n([Ginnifer Goodwin](/wiki/Ginnifer_Goodwin \"Ginnifer Goodwin\")).[22] Wanting\nto hurt Regina, Jefferson breaks Belle out of her cell and instructs that she\nseek out Mr. Gold, insisting that he will protect her. Belle does so, shocking\nGold beyond belief as he spent years believing she was dead. He embraces her\nwith a hug, though she has no memory of him, but he assures her that she soon\nwill. The two are seen headed towards the town's wishing well when the curse\nis officially broken. Belle's memories are restored, as she embraces Gold and\ndeclares her love for him, which he reciprocates. Gold puts their reunion on a\nshort hold though, as he proceeds to drop a vial of True Love into the well,\nbringing magic to Storybrooke.[23]\n\n### Season\n2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Belle_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Season 2\")]\n\nThough Belle has been reunited with Rumplestiltskin, he continues to struggle\nwith his dark impulses. Upon learning that Regina had locked Belle up for 28\nyears, he summons a Wraith to kill the Queen. A disappointed Belle temporarily\nleaves him. She soon returns though, deciding she can't give up on him just\nyet, and they continue to pursue a relationship.[24] Belle moves in with\nRumple, as she is oblivious to her father trying to find her; however, when he\ndoes, he attempts to force her over the town line to make her forget about her\nlife with Rumplestiltskin, refusing to bless their relationship. This makes\nher both upset with him and Rumple, who she's learned is continuing to\npractice dark magic. Though she cuts ties with both of them, she eventually\ngives Rumple another chance upon realizing that he's attempting to change,\ngiving her the town's library and setting her up with the apartment above it.\nThey agree to then go out and get a hamburger, as Belle has never had one\nbefore.[25] As Belle explores life in Storybrooke, she comes to befriend\n[Ruby](/wiki/List_of_Once_Upon_a_Time_characters#Red_Riding_Hood \"List of Once\nUpon a Time characters\") ([Meghan Ory](/wiki/Meghan_Ory \"Meghan Ory\")), who\nturns into a werewolf during every full moon. Belle stands by Ruby and insists\nthat she is not the monster many believe her to be, as Belle sees the goodness\nin her heart.[26] Meanwhile, Belle and Rumple grow closer, as they continue to\ngo out on dates like lunch at Granny's Diner and a picnic in Rumple's\npawnshop.

After Rumple spares Hook's life and\nprepares to leave town, Hook shoots Belle in an attempt at revenge. This sends\nher tumbling across the town line, causing her to lose her memory, just as an\noutsider drives into Storybrooke.[19] Though Rumple is able to heal Belle's\ngunshot wound immediately, she's escorted to the hospital in order to be kept\nunder intensive care while suffering from amnesia. Rumple attempts to get\nthrough to Belle by showing her the chipped teacup, a remnant of their life\ntogether, but a scared and confused Belle throws and smashes the cup.\nHeartbroken, Rumple leaves.[29] Ruby visits Belle in the hospital but is\ndisappointed that she doesn't remember who she is. When Belle recalls Rumple\nhealing her wound with magic, as well as creating a fireball to throw at Hook,\nRuby acts as though Belle isn't making any sense. Belle knows what she saw\nthough, sending her into a frenzy, prompting a nurse sedating her.

Their call ends, but Rumple is\ncured when Mary Margaret sacrifices Cora's life for Rumple's.[32] Belle is\nrelieved when Rumple visits her, seeing that he's still alive. Their happiness\ndoes not last though, as Regina magically instills a new persona in Belle - a\nparty girl with loose morals by the name of Lacey - who Rumple soon finds at\nthe local bar, after being discharged from the hospital. The two don't\ninitially click, but Rumple is soon able to make it work when he discovers\nthat Lacey is attracted to his dark side.[14] They continue to pursue a\nrelationship, but Hook learns that Rumple is still alive when he sees the\ncouple out walking the streets of Storybrooke.[33] Lacey serves as a bad\ninfluence for Rumple, which goes noticed by Baelfire, now known as Neal\n([Michael Raymond-James](/wiki/Michael_Raymond-James \"Michael Raymond-\nJames\")), who Rumple has found and brought back to Storybrooke. Lacey soon\nlearns that Rumple has magic, as well as the ability to grant her eternal\nyouth.

Rumple absorbs Neal's body and\nconsciousness into himself before Neal can die, however, and the Wicked Witch\nof the West obtains Rumple's dagger.

In Storybrooke, Emma separates Neal from\nRumple's body in order to learn the identity of the Wicked Witch, and Neal\ndies shortly after.

Later, Belle helps Emma and Elsa\ndeduce the Snow Queen's ultimate goal. Belle eventually learns of Rumple's\ndeception, tearfully banishing her husband from the town with the power of the\nreal dagger before he is able to kill Hook. While Gold is gone, Belle and Hook\nform a kind of friendship as they work together to find a way to free the\nfairies from the Sorcerer's Hat. Gold manages to return to Storybrooke with\nUrsula and Cruella de Vil, only to find Belle involved in a romantic\nrelationship with Will Scarlet. In an attempt to threaten Gold, who is now\nworking with the Queens of Darkness, Regina steals Belle's heart. Gold and\nWill work together to get it back, and Gold returns the heart to Belle and\napologizes once again for his actions, telling Will that it is now his job to\nprotect Belle's heart. In the alternate reality temporarily created by The\nAuthor, Belle and Rumple are living happily together with a child of their\nown. When Henry undoes The Author's actions and returns everyone to reality,\nBelle tells Gold that they could have truly had that happiness if not for his\nactions. As Gold's condition worsens, and he is consumed by the Dark One's\npowers, Belle confesses to him that she does not love Will and vows not to let\nhim die alone. The Sorcerer's Apprentice removes the darkness from Gold's\nheart, though he remains in a comatose state whilst the darkness is taken in\nby Emma Swan.\n\n### Season\n5[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Belle_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Season 5\")]\n\nWith the other residents of Storybrooke, Belle travels to the Enchanted\nForest, taking Emma to Camelot in order to find Merlin and remove the Dark\nOne's power from within her. However, weeks later, they return to Storybrooke\nwith missing memories as to how they failed. During her time in Camelot,\nBelle's growing knowledge of spells helped to free Lancelot and Merida from\nKing Arthur's prison. Belle subsequently helped Merida of Dunbroch win back\nher kingdom and save her three brothers from the other clans. In Storybrooke,\nDark Emma awakens Rumple from his coma. Emma then steals Merida's heart and\ncommands her to kill Belle in hopes that it will inspire Rumple to become a\nhero. Rumple insists that he and Belle leave town, but she refuses to run away\nfrom her life and the people she cares about. Dark Emma transforms Merida into\na bear that chases Belle through the woods until the bear is stopped by\nRumple, who feeds it anti-transformation powder in order to revert Merida to\nhuman form. Belle witnesses Rumple embrace his newfound heroism and remove\nExcalibur from its stone. After everyone's memory is restored and Rumple\nheroically faces Dark Hook, Rumple tells Belle that he is ready to finally be\nthe man she deserves. Belle declines his offer to rekindle their relationship,\nstating that she has spent too long trying to heal his heart and that she has\nlost track of her own in the process. Upon the arrival of all previous Dark\nOnes in Storybrooke, Rumple sends Belle out of town so that she may escape the\nimmediate threat and finally see the world as she has always wanted to. Belle\naccepts the offer and leaves, but returns once the threat is vanquished and\ntells Rumple that she wants to be with him because he has proven to be truly\nselfless, though she is unaware that Rumple has now reclaimed the powers of\nthe Dark One.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Belle_5x17.jpg/220px-\nBelle_5x17.jpg)](/wiki/File:Belle_5x17.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Belle_5x17.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBelle and Rumple work together to protect their unborn child.\n\nBelle remains in Storybrooke when Rumple travels with Emma to the Underworld\nto rescue Hook, but is unaware that she is pregnant with their first child\n(although it is Rumple's second born child). It is revealed that, many years\nago, Rumple promised his second born child to a healer back in the Enchanted\nForest in exchange for saving young Baelfire's life. Now the healer has died\nand signed the contract over to Hades, whom the baby is now owed to. After she\nis sent through a portal along with Zelena and her daughter, Belle learns the\ntruth from Gold about his reacquired powers and her pregnancy as well as the\ncontract, putting her life and that of their unborn child in jeopardy once\nagain. Belle is horrified by Rumple's embracing of his inner darkness, but\nagrees to work with him to save their child from Hades. Motivated by Hades,\nGaston makes multiple attempts to kill Rumplestiltskin, reuniting Belle with\nher ex-fiancé. After confronting Gold about his murder of Gaston decades\nearlier, Belle intends to help Gaston move on from the Underworld, only to\nlearn that Gaston blames her for his death. In an attempt to rescue\nRumplestiltskin, Belle inadvertently pushes Gaston into the River of Lost\nSouls, damning him to eternal torment. Consumed with guilt over what she did\nto Gaston and fearing for her child's safety, Belle places herself under a\nsleeping curse given to her by Zelena, believing it would give Gold enough\ntime to save their child from Hades. Before falling under, Belle makes Gold\npromise to return her to her father. Gold attempts to wake Belle with True\nLove's Kiss and fails, for Belle had begun losing faith in him again. To keep\nher and his unborn child safe, Rumple places Belle inside of Pandora's Box. In\nthe season five finale, Pandora's Box is stolen by Mr. Hyde from the Land of\nUntold Stories. Hyde agrees to return the box containing Belle to Gold if he\nallows Hyde to conquer Storybrooke, a deal which Gold readily accepts.\n\n### Season\n6[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Belle_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Season 6\")]\n\nBelle remains in her self-induced sleeping curse in Pandora's Box. Rumple\nenters her dreamworld to try to wake her, but fails in doing so. Her unborn\nson wakes her instead, and she once again rejects Rumple's offer to make a\nhome together. As she seeks a new place to stay, Hook offers for Belle to stay\non the Jolly Roger in repentance for attacking her in the past. Belle forgives\nhim and accepts, recognizing that Hook is a changed man. After making a deal\nwith Gold, David delivers a cassette tape to Belle which plays a Scottish\nlullaby recorded by Rumple for their son. Soon after, Rumple casts a spell\nforbidding Belle to leave the boat due to a serious threat from Mr. Hyde.\nHowever, the spell puts her in danger when she cannot flee from the true\nthreat, Dr. Jekyll. This further deteriorates Belle and Rumple's relationship,\nas she insists she does not need his protection and Rumple argues that she\nwill come back to him when she needs him. When Zelena notifies Belle of\nRumple's relationship with the Evil Queen (Regina's newly-separated \"evil\nhalf\") and his plans to use the Shears of Destiny on their son to keep him\nfrom growing to hate Rumple, Belle confronts him. She tells him to stop trying\nto take their son's love, but to be worthy of it instead. Belle briefly forges\nan alliance with Zelena in order to escape Storybrooke, but Rumple stops them\nbefore she can. In the episode \"[Changelings](/wiki/Changelings\n\"Changelings\")\", the Evil Queen speeds up Belle's pregnancy and Belle gives\nbirth to Gideon. She gives her son to the Blue Fairy, fearing Rumple will try\nto take the child as he previously threatened. But the Blue Fairy is ambushed\nby Rumple's mother, the Black Fairy. Gideon is taken to the Dark Realm where\nhe grows up very quickly and develops an immoral persona. Rumple apologizes\nfor his villainous actions and tells Belle that they need to start trusting\neach other in order to save their son. In the mid-season finale, an adult\nGideon arrives in Storybrooke and is shown confronting his mother and father\nin Gold's shop.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Belle_6x22.jpg/220px-\nBelle_6x22.jpg)](/wiki/File:Belle_6x22.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Belle_6x22.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBelle and Rumple finally get their \"happy beginning\".\n\nGideon explains to his parents that he has arrived in Storybrooke to kill the\nSavior and take her powers for himself in order to defeat the Black Fairy and\nfree the Dark Realm. Belle agrees to work with Rumple in order to save their\nson from the darkness growing inside of him and to prevent the looming \"war\"\nin Storybrooke. Rumple and Belle later learn that Gideon has been under the\ncontrol of the Black Fairy, who has stolen his heart. After Rumple secretly\nforges an alliance with his mother in order to retrieve Gideon's heart, he\nreturns the heart and Gideon happily reunites with his parents. The Black\nFairy then casts her curse to begin the Final Battle, which separates Belle\nfrom her husband and son and turns her into a recluse and a hermit, afraid to\nleave the confines of her home. This is in direct contrast to Belle's true\nnature and love of travel and adventure. In addition, the Black Fairy once\nagain steals Gideon's heart and commands him to kill the Savior. To break the\ncurse, Rumple kills the Black Fairy, and he and Belle happily reunite.\nTogether they enter the mines to once again retrieve Gideon's heart and stop\nhim before he can kill Emma. Upon finding the heart and considering the power\nhe could gain from Emma's death, Rumple makes the decision to ignore his dark\nimpulses and commands Gideon to let Emma live. The end of the Final Battle\nsees adult Gideon disappear and reappear to Belle and Rumple as the baby she\noriginally gave up. Belle and Rumple celebrate their \"happy beginning\"\ntogether with the Charmings, Emma, Hook, Regina, and Zelena at Granny's Diner.\n\n### Season\n7[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Belle_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Season 7\")]\n\nOne year after the events of the season six finale, Belle and Rumple are\nplanning baby Gideon’s first birthday party. Rumple gives Belle a travel book\nand promises her that he’s going to give her what she’s always wanted: a\nchance to see the world. Ten years later, along their travels, Belle, Rumple,\nand Gideon explore an ancient bridge above a river said to grant people’s\ngreatest wishes. Rumple reveals to Belle that he no longer wishes to have the\npowers of the Dark One, because he wants to live out a mortal life with her.\nHe drops the dagger into the river, but it instantly reappears. Belle vows to\nhelp Rumple find a way to be rid of his curse forever. Eight years later,\nBelle, Rumple, and Gideon are living in a castle or large estate in an\nunspecified location. Belle and Rumple are ecstatic to discover that (a now\n18-year-old) Gideon has been accepted into a prestigious academy. Belle then\nreveals to Rumple that she has discovered and translated a fairy prophecy,\nwhich states: “When the Dark One finds eternal love, at the sun’s brightest\nset, where time stops, the path will appear to where the darkness shall rest.”\nRumple tells Belle that the place referred to by the prophecy is the Edge of\nRealms, the edge of all existence where the sun never sets and time passes\ndifferently. Belle understands at this time that “the sun’s brightest set”\nmeans her own death, but purposely withholds this information from Rumple as\nshe knows he would do anything to prevent it. Belle decides she would rather\nlive a long, happy life with Rumple rather than endlessly seeking another\nanswer. The two travel to the Edge of Realms and decide to build their home\nthere without the use of magic. Many blissful years pass, as Belle ages into\nan elderly woman and Rumple remains immortal. On her deathbed, Belle reveals\nto a distraught Rumple that only by letting her go may he finally find the\nanswer to getting rid of the Dark One curse and ultimately reunite with her in\ndeath. Rumple tells Belle that he is too afraid to let her go, but she reminds\nhim of their timeless tale. As she passes, Belle’s final words to Rumple are:\n“You let me go once before, and we found our way back to each other. You’re a\ngood man, Rumple. Your heart is pure. You will find the answer you need to get\nrid of the dagger, and you will find your way back to me, okay? I promise.”\n(\"[Beauty](/wiki/Beauty_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Beauty \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\")\n\nAs the season progresses, Rumple's quest to reunite with her seems hopeless,\nuntil the series finale \"[Leaving Storybrooke](/wiki/Leaving_Storybrooke\n\"Leaving Storybrooke\")\", in which he sacrifices his heart to save the Captain\nHook from the Wish Realm. Upon his death, Belle appears to him in the\nafterlife in her signature golden dress. The two kiss, as Belle says, “I knew\nyou’d make it home.”\n\n## Character development and\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Belle_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Character development and reception\")]\n\nThe producers had planned to make the Belle only a recurring role in the\nseries,[37] but after sporadic appearances in the first season and an\noverwhelmingly positive reaction from fans to Belle and Rumplestiltskin's\nrelationship, she was promoted to a series regular in the second season.[38]\n\nHad de Ravin not accepted the role of Belle, she would've gone on to star in a\ntelevision series called _[Americana](/wiki/Americana_\\(TV_pilot\\) \"Americana\n\\(TV pilot\\)\")_ ; ABC decided to pass on the pilot in 2012.[39]\n\nde Ravin's return as Belle in the season seven episode\n[\"Beauty\"](/wiki/Beauty_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Beauty \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\nreceived widespread critical acclaim. In [an interview with _Entertainment\nWeekly_](http://ew.com/tv/2017/10/27/once-upon-a-time-emilie-de-ravin-belle-\ndead/), de Ravin said, \"I was so excited to be able to bring their story to\nthe fans and to bring their later years in love, and to be able to play that\nwas really beautiful. They’ve had quite a tumultuous relationship, so for them\nto be able to get to a place of such acceptance with each other and\nthemselves, and with life, and this inner peace that has washed over them. […]\nHer acceptance of mortality is shining a lot brighter than his acceptance or\nnon-acceptance of immortality, which you’d expect to be the reverse in a way.\nThat’s quite beautiful and was lovely to play.\"\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Belle_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Abrams, Natalie (July 22, 2017).
