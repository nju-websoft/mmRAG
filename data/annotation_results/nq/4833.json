They played in the\n[West](/wiki/National_League_West \"National League West\") Division from 1969\nto 1993, and the [Central](/wiki/National_League_Central \"National League\nCentral\") Division from 1994 to 2012.

They formed the Houston Sports Association as their vehicle\nfor attaining a big league franchise for the city of Houston.[6]\n\nGiven MLB's refusal to consider expansion, Kirksey, Cullinan, Smith, and\nHofheinz joined forces with would-be owners from other cities and announced\nthe formation of a new league to compete with the established National and\nAmerican Leagues. They called the new league the [Continental\nLeague](/wiki/Continental_League \"Continental League\"). Wanting to protect\npotential new markets, both existing leagues chose to expand from eight teams\nto ten. However, plans eventually fell through for the Houston franchise after\nthe Houston Buffaloes owner, [Marty Marion](/wiki/Marty_Marion \"Marty\nMarion\"), could not come to an agreement with the HSA to sell the team.[7] To\nmake matters worse, the Continental League as a whole folded in August 1960.\n\nHowever, on October 17, 1960, the [National League](/wiki/National_League\n\"National League\") [granted an expansion\nfranchise](/wiki/1962_Major_League_Baseball_expansion \"1962 Major League\nBaseball expansion\") to the Houston Sports Association in which their team\ncould begin play in the 1962 season. According to the [Major League Baseball\nConstitution](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Constitution \"Major League Baseball\nConstitution\"), the Houston Sports Association was required to obtain\nterritorial rights from the Houston Buffaloes in order to play in the Houston\narea, and again negotiations began to purchase the team.[8][9] Eventually, the\nHouston Sports Association succeeded in purchasing the Houston Buffaloes, at\nthis point majority-owned by William Hopkins, on January 17, 1961.[10] The\nBuffs played one last minor league season as the top farm team of the [Chicago\nCubs](/wiki/Chicago_Cubs \"Chicago Cubs\") in 1961 before being succeeded by the\ncity's NL club.\n\nThe new Houston team was named the Colt .45s after a \"Name The Team\" contest\nwas won by William Irving Neder. The [Colt .45](/wiki/Colt_Single_Action_Army\n\"Colt Single Action Army\") was well known as \"the gun that won the west.\"[11]\nThe colors selected were navy blue and orange. The first team was formed\nmostly through an [expansion\ndraft](/wiki/1961_Major_League_Baseball_expansion_draft \"1961 Major League\nBaseball expansion draft\") after the 1961 season. The Colt .45s and their\nexpansion cousins, the [New York Mets](/wiki/New_York_Mets \"New York Mets\"),\ntook turns choosing players left unprotected by the other National League\nfranchises.\n\nMany of those associated with the Houston Buffaloes organization were allowed\nby the ownership to continue in the major league. Manager [Harry\nCraft](/wiki/Harry_Craft \"Harry Craft\"), who had joined Houston in 1961,\nremained in the same position for the team until the end of the [1964\nseason](/wiki/1964_Houston_Colt_.45s_season \"1964 Houston Colt .45s season\").\nGeneral manager [Spec Richardson](/wiki/Spec_Richardson \"Spec Richardson\")\nalso continued with the organization as business manager, but was later\npromoted again to the same position with the Astros from 1967 until 1975.\nAlthough most players for the major league franchise were obtained through the\n[1961 Major League Baseball expansion\ndraft](/wiki/1961_Major_League_Baseball_expansion_draft \"1961 Major League\nBaseball expansion draft\"), Buffs players [J.C. Hartman](/wiki/J.C._Hartman\n\"J.C.

Loel Passe worked alongside [Gene Elston](/wiki/Gene_Elston\n\"Gene Elston\") as a color commentator until he retired from broadcasting in\n1976. Elston continued with the Astros until 1986.\n\nThe Colt .45s began their existence playing at [Colt\nStadium](/wiki/Colt_Stadium \"Colt Stadium\"), a temporary venue built just\nnorth of the construction site of the indoor stadium.\n\n### 1962–1964: The Colt\n.45s[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: 1962–1964: The Colt .45s\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ce/HOU_1094.gif/220px-\nHOU_1094.gif)](/wiki/File:HOU_1094.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HOU_1094.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nColt .45s logo, 1962–1964\n\nThe Colt .45s started their inaugural season on April 10, 1962, against the\n[Chicago Cubs](/wiki/1962_Chicago_Cubs_season \"1962 Chicago Cubs season\") with\n[Harry Craft](/wiki/Harry_Craft \"Harry Craft\") as the Colt .45s' manager. [Bob\nAspromonte](/wiki/Bob_Aspromonte \"Bob Aspromonte\") scored the first run for\nthe Colt .45s on an [Al Spangler](/wiki/Al_Spangler \"Al Spangler\") triple in\nthe first inning.[12] They started the season with a three-game sweep of the\nCubs but eventually finished eighth among the National League's ten teams. The\nteam's best pitcher, [Richard \"Turk\" Farrell](/wiki/Turk_Farrell \"Turk\nFarrell\"), lost 20 games despite an [ERA](/wiki/Earned_run_average \"Earned run\naverage\") of 3.02. A starter for the Colt .45s, Farrell was primarily a relief\npitcher prior to playing for Houston. He was selected to both All-Star Games\nin 1962.[13]\n\nThe 1963 season saw more young talent mixed with seasoned veterans. [Jimmy\nWynn](/wiki/Jimmy_Wynn \"Jimmy Wynn\"), [Rusty Staub](/wiki/Rusty_Staub \"Rusty\nStaub\"), and [Joe Morgan](/wiki/Joe_Morgan \"Joe Morgan\") all made their major\nleague debuts in the [1963 season](/wiki/1963_Major_League_Baseball_season\n\"1963 Major League Baseball season\"). However, Houston's position in the\nstandings did not improve. In fact, the Colt .45s finished in ninth place with\na 66–96 record. The team was still building, trying to find that perfect mix\nto compete.[6] The 1964 campaign began on a sad note, as relief pitcher [Jim\nUmbricht](/wiki/Jim_Umbricht \"Jim Umbricht\") died of cancer at the age of 33\non April 8, just before [Opening Day](/wiki/Opening_Day \"Opening Day\").[14]\nUmbricht was the only Colt .45s pitcher to post a winning record in Houston's\nfirst two seasons. He was so well liked by players and fans that the team\nretired his jersey number, 32, in 1965.[15]\n\nJust on the horizon, the structure of the new domed stadium was more prevalent\nand it would soon change the way that baseball was watched in Houston and\naround the league. On December 1, 1964, the team announced the name change\nfrom Colt .45s to \"Astros.\"[16][17][18]\n\n### 1965–1970: The Great\nIndoors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: 1965–1970: The Great Indoors\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/HOU_1093.gif/220px-\nHOU_1093.gif)](/wiki/File:HOU_1093.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HOU_1093.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nAstros logo, 1965–1974 with the Astrodome\n\nWith Judge [Roy Hofheinz](/wiki/Roy_Hofheinz \"Roy Hofheinz\") now the sole\nowner of the franchise and the new venue complete, the renamed \"Astros\" moved\ninto their new domed stadium, the [_Astro_ dome](/wiki/Astrodome \"Astrodome\"),\nin 1965. The name honored Houston's position as the center of the nation's\nspace program; [NASA](/wiki/NASA \"NASA\")'s new [Manned Spacecraft\nCenter](/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson_Space_Center \"Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\")\nhad recently opened southeast of the city. The Astrodome, coined the \"Eighth\nWonder of the World\", did little to improve the home team's results on the\nfield. While several \"indoor\" firsts were accomplished, the team still\nfinished ninth in the standings. The attendance was high not because of the\nteam accomplishments, but because people came from miles around to see the\nAstrodome.\n\nJust as the excitement was settling down over the Astrodome, the [1966\nseason](/wiki/1966_Major_League_Baseball_season \"1966 Major League Baseball\nseason\") found something new to put the domed stadium in the spotlight once\nagain – the field. Grass would not grow in the new park, since the roof panels\nhad been painted to reduce the glare that was causing players on both the\nAstros and the visiting teams to miss routine pop flies. A new artificial turf\nwas created called \"[AstroTurf](/wiki/AstroTurf \"AstroTurf\")\" and Houston\nwould be involved in yet another change in the way the game was played.[19]\n\nWith new manager [Grady Hatton](/wiki/Grady_Hatton \"Grady Hatton\") the Astros\nstarted the 1966 season strong. By May they were in second place in the\nNational League and looked like a team that could contend. [Joe\nMorgan](/wiki/Joe_Morgan \"Joe Morgan\") was named as a starter on the [All-Star\nTeam](/wiki/1966_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game \"1966 Major League\nBaseball All-Star Game\"). The success did not last as they lost [Jimmy\nWynn](/wiki/Jimmy_Wynn \"Jimmy Wynn\") for the season after he crashed into an\noutfield fence in [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\") and Morgan\nhad broken his knee cap.[6] [1967](/wiki/1967_Houston_Astros_season \"1967\nHouston Astros season\") saw first baseman [Eddie Mathews](/wiki/Eddie_Mathews\n\"Eddie Mathews\") join the Astros. The slugger hit his 500th home run while in\nHouston. He would be traded late in the season and [Doug\nRader](/wiki/Doug_Rader \"Doug Rader\") would be promoted to the big leagues.\nRookie [Don Wilson](/wiki/Don_Wilson_\\(baseball\\) \"Don Wilson \\(baseball\\)\")\npitched a no-hitter on June 18. Wynn also provided some enthusiasm in 1967.\nThe 5 ft 9 in Wynn was becoming known not only for how often he hit home runs,\nbut also for how far he hit them. Wynn set club records with 37 home runs, and\n107 RBIs. It was also in 1967 that Wynn hit his famous home run onto\n[Interstate 75](/wiki/Interstate_75 \"Interstate 75\") in\n[Cincinnati](/wiki/Cincinnati \"Cincinnati\").[20] As the season came to a\nclose, the Astros found themselves again in ninth place and with a winning\npercentage below .500. The team looked good on paper, but could not make it\nwork on the field.\n\nApril 15, 1968 saw a pitching duel for the ages. The Astros' [Don\nWilson](/wiki/Don_Wilson_\\(baseball\\) \"Don Wilson \\(baseball\\)\") and the Mets'\n[Tom Seaver](/wiki/Tom_Seaver \"Tom Seaver\") faced each other in a pitching\nduel that lasted six hours. Seaver went ten innings, allowing no walks and\njust two hits. Wilson went nine innings, allowing five hits and three walks.\nAfter the starters exited, eleven relievers (seven for the Mets and four for\nthe Astros) tried to end the game. The game finally ended in the 24th inning\nwhen Aspromonte hit a shot toward Mets shortstop [Al Weis](/wiki/Al_Weis \"Al\nWeis\"). Weis had been perfect all night at short, but he was not quick enough\nto make the play. The ball zipped into left field, allowing [Norm\nMiller](/wiki/Norm_Miller_\\(baseball\\) \"Norm Miller \\(baseball\\)\") to\nscore.[21]\n\nWith baseball expansion and trades, the Astros had dramatically changed in\n[1969](/wiki/1969_Houston_Astros_season \"1969 Houston Astros season\").\nAspromonte was sent to the Braves and Staub was traded to the expansion\n[Montreal Expos](/wiki/Montreal_Expos \"Montreal Expos\"), in exchange for\noutfielder [Jesús Alou](/wiki/Jes%C3%BAs_Alou \"Jesús Alou\") and first baseman\n[Donn Clendenon](/wiki/Donn_Clendenon \"Donn Clendenon\"). However, Clendenon\nrefused to report to Houston, electing to retire and take job with a pen\nmanufacturing company. The Astros asked Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to void the\ntrade, but he refused. Instead, he awarded Jack Billingham and a left-handed\nrelief pitcher to the Astros to complete the trade. Cuellar was traded to the\n[Baltimore Orioles](/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles \"Baltimore Orioles\") for [Curt\nBlefary](/wiki/Curt_Blefary \"Curt Blefary\"). Other new players included\ncatcher [Johnny Edwards](/wiki/Johnny_Edwards_\\(baseball\\) \"Johnny Edwards\n\\(baseball\\)\"), infielder [Denis Menke](/wiki/Denis_Menke \"Denis Menke\"), and\npitcher [Denny Lemaster](/wiki/Denny_Lemaster \"Denny Lemaster\"). Wilson\ncontinued to pitch brilliantly and on May 1 threw the second no-hitter of his\ncareer. In that game, he struck out 18 batters, tying what was then the all-\ntime single-game mark. He was just 24 years of age and was second to only\n[Sandy Koufax](/wiki/Sandy_Koufax \"Sandy Koufax\") for career no-hit wins.\nWilson's no-hitter lit the Astros' fire after a miserable month of April, and\nsix days later the team tied a major league record by turning seven double\nplays in a game. By May's end the Astros had put together a ten-game winning\nstreak. The Houston infield tandem of Menke and Joe Morgan continued to\nimprove, providing power at the plate and great defense. Morgan had 15 homers\nand stole 49 bases while Menke led the Astros with 90 RBIs. The Menke/Morgan\npunch was beginning to come alive, and the team was responding to Walker's\nmanagement style. The Astros dominated the season series against their\nexpansion twins, the New York Mets, that season. In one game at New York,\nDenis Menke and Jimmy Wynn hit [grand slams](/wiki/Grand_slam_\\(baseball\\)\n\"Grand slam \\(baseball\\)\") in the same inning, against a Mets team that would\ngo on to win the World Series that same year. The Astros finished the 1969\nseason with a record of 81 wins, 81 losses, marking their first season of .500\nball.\n\nIn [1970](/wiki/1970_Houston_Astros_season \"1970 Houston Astros season\"), the\nAstros were expected to be a serious threat in the National League West. In\nJune, 19-year-old [César Cedeño](/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Cede%C3%B1o \"César Cedeño\")\nwas called up and immediately showed signs of being a superstar. The Dominican\noutfielder batted .310 after being called up. Not to be outdone, [Denis\nMenke](/wiki/Denis_Menke \"Denis Menke\") batted .304 and [Jesús\nAlou](/wiki/Jes%C3%BAs_Alou \"Jesús Alou\") batted .306. The Astros' batting\naverage was up by 19 points compared to the season before.[20][22] The team\nlooked good, but the Astros' ERA was up. [Larry Dierker](/wiki/Larry_Dierker\n\"Larry Dierker\") and [Don Wilson](/wiki/Don_Wilson_\\(baseball\\) \"Don Wilson\n\\(baseball\\)\") had winning records, but the pitching staff as a whole had an\noff season. Houston finished in fourth place in 1970.\n\n### 1971–1974: The boys in\norange[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: 1971–1974: The boys in orange\")]\n\nThe fashion trends of the 1970s had started taking root in baseball. Long hair\nand loud colors were starting to appear on team uniforms, including the\nAstros'. In 1971 the Astros made some changes to their uniform: they kept the\nsame style they had in previous seasons, but inverted the colors. What was\nnavy blue was now orange and what was orange was now a lighter shade of blue.\nThe players' last names were added to the back of the jerseys. In 1972, the\nuniform fabric was also changed to what was at the time revolutionizing the\nindustry – polyester. Belts were replaced by elastic waistbands, and jerseys\nzipped up instead of having buttons. The uniforms became popular with fans,\nbut would last only until 1975, when the Astros would shock baseball and the\nfashion world.[23]\n\nThe uniforms were about the only thing that did change in 1971. The\nacquisition of [Roger Metzger](/wiki/Roger_Metzger \"Roger Metzger\") from the\n[Chicago Cubs](/wiki/Chicago_Cubs \"Chicago Cubs\") in the off-season moved\nMenke to first base and [Bob Watson](/wiki/Bob_Watson \"Bob Watson\") to the\noutfield. The Astros got off to a slow start and the pitching and hitting\naverages were down. [Larry Dierker](/wiki/Larry_Dierker \"Larry Dierker\") was\nselected to the All-Star game in 1971, but due to an arm injury he could not\nmake it. [César Cedeño](/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Cede%C3%B1o \"César Cedeño\") led the\nclub with 81 RBIs and the league with 40 doubles, but batted just .264 and had\n102 strikeouts in his second season with the Astros.[24] Pitcher [J. R.\nRichard](/wiki/J._R._Richard \"J. R. Richard\") made his debut in September of\nthe 1971 season against the [Giants](/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants \"San Francisco\nGiants\").\n\n#### The Big\nTrade[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: The Big Trade\")]\n\nSee also: [The Big Red Machine](/wiki/The_Big_Red_Machine \"The Big Red\nMachine\")\n\nIn November [1971](/wiki/1971_Houston_Astros_season \"1971 Houston Astros\nseason\") the Astros and [Cincinnati Reds](/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds \"Cincinnati\nReds\") made one of the biggest blockbuster trades in the history of the\nsport,[25] and helped create The Big Red Machine of the 1970s,[26] with the\nReds getting the better end of the deal. Houston sent second baseman [Joe\nMorgan](/wiki/Joe_Morgan \"Joe Morgan\"), infielder [Denis\nMenke](/wiki/Denis_Menke \"Denis Menke\"), pitcher [Jack\nBillingham](/wiki/Jack_Billingham \"Jack Billingham\"), outfielder [César\nGerónimo](/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Ger%C3%B3nimo \"César Gerónimo\") and prospect [Ed\nArmbrister](/wiki/Ed_Armbrister \"Ed Armbrister\") to Cincinnati for first\nbaseman [Lee May](/wiki/Lee_May \"Lee May\"), second baseman [Tommy\nHelms](/wiki/Tommy_Helms \"Tommy Helms\") and infielder [Jimmy\nStewart](/wiki/Jimmy_Stewart_\\(baseball\\) \"Jimmy Stewart \\(baseball\\)\"). The\ntrade left Astros fans and the baseball world scratching their heads as to why\n[General Manager](/wiki/General_manager_\\(baseball\\) \"General manager\n\\(baseball\\)\") [Spec Richardson](/wiki/Spec_Richardson \"Spec Richardson\")\nwould give up so much for so little. The Reds, on the other hand, would shore\nup many problems. They had an off year in 1971, but were the National League\nPennant winner in [1972](/wiki/1972_Cincinnati_Reds_season \"1972 Cincinnati\nReds season\").[25]\n\nThe Astros' acquisition of Lee May added more power to the lineup in\n[1972](/wiki/1972_Houston_Astros_season \"1972 Houston Astros season\"). May,\nWynn, Rader and Cedeño all had 20 or more home runs and Watson hit 16. Cedeño\nalso led the Astros with a .320 batting average, 55 stolen bases and made\nspectacular plays on the field. Cedeño made his first All-Star game in 1972\nand became the first Astros player in team history to hit for the cycle in\nAugust versus the Reds. The Astros finished the strike-shortened season at\n84-69, their first winning season.[6]\n\nAstros fans had hoped for more of the same in\n[1973](/wiki/1973_Major_League_Baseball_season \"1973 Major League Baseball\nseason\"), but it was not to be. The Astros run production was down, even\nthough the same five sluggers the year before were still punching the ball out\nof the park. Lee May led the Astros with 28 home runs and Cesar Cedeño batted\n.320 with 25 home runs. [Bob Watson](/wiki/Bob_Watson \"Bob Watson\") hit the\n.312 mark and drove in 94 runs. [Doug Rader](/wiki/Doug_Rader \"Doug Rader\")\nand [Jimmy Wynn](/wiki/Jimmy_Wynn \"Jimmy Wynn\") both had 20 or more home runs.\nHowever, injuries to their pitching staff limited the Astros to an 82–80\nfourth-place finish. The Astros again finished in fourth place the next year\nunder new manager [Preston Gómez](/wiki/Preston_G%C3%B3mez \"Preston\nGómez\").[6][27]\n\n### 1975–1979: The rainbow\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: 1975–1979: The rainbow era\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Houston_Astros_logo.gif/220px-\nHouston_Astros_logo.gif)](/wiki/File:Houston_Astros_logo.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Houston_Astros_logo.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nAstros logo, 1975–1993 with the Astrodome\n\nWith the $38 million deficit of the Astrodome, control of the\nAstrodomain[_[further explanation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\n\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_] was passed from Judge [Roy\nHofheinz](/wiki/Roy_Hofheinz \"Roy Hofheinz\") to GE Credit and Ford Motor\nCredit. This included the Astros. The creditors were just interested in\npreserving asset value of the team, so any money spent had to be found or\nsaved somewhere else.[28] [Tal Smith](/wiki/Tal_Smith \"Tal Smith\") returned to\nthe Astros from the [New York Yankees](/wiki/New_York_Yankees \"New York\nYankees\") to find a team that needed a lot of work and did not have a lot of\nmoney. However, there would be some bright spots that would prove to be good\ninvestments in the near future.\n\nThe year started on a sad note. Pitcher Don Wilson was found dead in the\npassenger seat of his car on January 5, 1975. Cause of death was asphyxiation\nby carbon monoxide. Wilson was 29 years old. Wilson's number 40 was retired on\nApril 13, 1975.[23]\n\nThe 1975 season saw the introduction of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams\nwere going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception.\nThe uniforms had multishade stripes of orange, red and yellow in front and in\nback behind a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same stripes ran\ndown the pant legs. Players numbers not only appeared on the back of the\njersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a\nfiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were\npanned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at\nthe high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from\nwhat other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road\nuntil 1980.[23]\n\nBesides the bright new uniforms there were some other changes. [Lee\nMay](/wiki/Lee_May \"Lee May\") was traded to\n[Baltimore](/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles \"Baltimore Orioles\") for much talked about\nrookie second baseman [Rob Andrews](/wiki/Rob_Andrews_\\(baseball\\) \"Rob\nAndrews \\(baseball\\)\") and utility player [Enos Cabell](/wiki/Enos_Cabell\n\"Enos Cabell\"). In Baltimore, Cabell was stuck behind third baseman [Brooks\nRobinson](/wiki/Brooks_Robinson \"Brooks Robinson\"), but he took advantage of\nhis opportunity in Houston and became their everyday third baseman.[29] Cabell\nwould go on to become a big part of the team's success in later years. With\nMay gone, [Bob Watson](/wiki/Bob_Watson \"Bob Watson\") was able to move to\nfirst base and was a bright spot in the line up, batting .324 with 85 RBI.\n\nThe two biggest moves the Astros made in the offseason were the acquisitions\nof [Joe Niekro](/wiki/Joe_Niekro \"Joe Niekro\") and [José\nCruz](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Cruz \"José Cruz\"). The Astros bought Niekro from the\n[Braves](/wiki/Atlanta_Braves \"Atlanta Braves\") for almost nothing. Niekro had\nbounced around the big leagues with minimal success. His older brother [Phil\nNiekro](/wiki/Phil_Niekro \"Phil Niekro\") had started teaching Joe how to throw\nhis knuckleball and Joe was just starting to use it when he came to the\nAstros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07.[30]\n[José Cruz](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Cruz \"José Cruz\") was also a steal, in retrospect,\nfrom the [Cardinals](/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals \"St. Louis Cardinals\").[31]\nCruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would\neventually have his number 25 retired.\n\nDespite high expectations, [1975](/wiki/1975_Houston_Astros_season \"1975\nHouston Astros season\") was among the Astros' worst in franchise history.\nTheir record of 64–97 was far worse than even the expansion Colt .45's and\nwould remain the worst record in franchise history until\n[2011](/wiki/2011_Houston_Astros_season \"2011 Houston Astros season\"). It was\nthe worst record in baseball and manager [Preston\nGómez](/wiki/Preston_G%C3%B3mez \"Preston Gómez\") was fired late in the season\nand replaced by [Bill Virdon](/wiki/Bill_Virdon \"Bill Virdon\"). The Astros\nplayed .500 ball under Virdon in the last 34 games of the season.[23] With\nVirdon as the manager the Astros improved greatly in 1976 finishing in third\nplace with an 80–82 record. A healthy [César\nCedeño](/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Cede%C3%B1o \"César Cedeño\") was a key reason for the\nAstros' success in 1976. [Bob Watson](/wiki/Bob_Watson \"Bob Watson\") continued\nto show consistency and led the club with a .313 average and 102 RBI. [José\nCruz](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Cruz \"José Cruz\") became Houston's everyday left fielder\nand hit .303 with 28 stolen bases.[32][33] 1976 saw the end of [Larry\nDierker](/wiki/Larry_Dierker \"Larry Dierker\")'s playing career as an Astro,\nbut before it was all over he would throw a no-hitter and win the 1,000th game\nin the Astrodome.[34] The Astros finished in third place again in\n[1977](/wiki/1977_Houston_Astros_season \"1977 Houston Astros season\") with a\nrecord of 81–81.[23]\n\nOne of the big problems the Astros had in the late 1970s was that they were\nunable to compete in the free agent market. Ford Motor Credit Company was\nstill in control of the team and was looking to sell the Astros, but they were\nnot going to spend money on better players. Most of the talent was either farm\ngrown or bought on the cheap.\n\nThe [1979 season](/wiki/1979_Houston_Astros_season \"1979 Houston Astros\nseason\") would prove to be a big turnaround in Astros history. During the\noffseason, the Astros made an effort to fix some of their problem areas. They\ntraded [Floyd Bannister](/wiki/Floyd_Bannister \"Floyd Bannister\") to\n[Seattle](/wiki/Seattle_Mariners \"Seattle Mariners\") for shortstop [Craig\nReynolds](/wiki/Craig_Reynolds_\\(baseball\\) \"Craig Reynolds \\(baseball\\)\") and\nacquired catcher [Alan Ashby](/wiki/Alan_Ashby \"Alan Ashby\") from\n[Toronto](/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays \"Toronto Blue Jays\") for pitcher [Mark\nLemongello](/wiki/Mark_Lemongello \"Mark Lemongello\"). Reynolds and Ashby were\nboth solid in their positions and gave Houston some much needed\nconsistency.[35] The season started with a boost from pitcher [Ken\nForsch](/wiki/Ken_Forsch \"Ken Forsch\"), who threw a [no-hitter](/wiki/No-\nhitter \"No-hitter\") the [Braves](/wiki/Atlanta_Braves \"Atlanta Braves\") the\nsecond game of the season.[23] In May 1979, New Jersey shipping tycoon Dr.\n[John McMullen](/wiki/John_McMullen_\\(engineer\\) \"John McMullen \\(engineer\\)\")\nhad agreed to buy the Astros. Now with an investor in charge, the Astros would\nbe more likely to compete in the free agent market.[36]\n\nThe Astros were playing great baseball throughout the season. [José\nCruz](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Cruz \"José Cruz\") and [Enos Cabell](/wiki/Enos_Cabell\n\"Enos Cabell\") both stole 30 bases. [Joe Niekro](/wiki/Joe_Niekro \"Joe\nNiekro\") had a great year with 21 wins and 3.00 ERA. [J. R.\nRichard](/wiki/J._R._Richard \"J. R. Richard\") won 18 games and set a new\npersonal strikeout record at 313. [Joe Sambito](/wiki/Joe_Sambito \"Joe\nSambito\") came into his own with 22 saves as the Astros closer. Things were\ngoing as they should for a team that could win the west.[23] The Astros and\nReds battled the final month of the season. The Reds pulled ahead of the\nAstros by a game and a half. Later that month they split a pair and the Reds\nkept the lead. That would be how it would end. The Astros finished with their\nbest record to that point at 89–73 and 1½ games behind the NL winner Reds.[23]\n\nWith Dr. McMullen as sole owner of the Astros, the team would now benefit in\nways a corporation could not give them. The rumors of the Astros moving out of\nHouston started to crumble and the Astros were now able to compete in the\nfree-agent market. McMullen showed the city of Houston that he too wanted a\nwinning team, signing nearby [Alvin, Texas](/wiki/Alvin,_Texas \"Alvin, Texas\")\nnative [Nolan Ryan](/wiki/Nolan_Ryan \"Nolan Ryan\") to the first million-\ndollar-a-year deal. Ryan had four career no-hitters already and had struck out\n383 in one season.[23]\n\n### 1980: On the\nBrink[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: 1980: On the Brink\")]\n\n[Joe Morgan](/wiki/Joe_Morgan \"Joe Morgan\") returned in 1980. Now back in\nHouston with two MVP awards and two [World Series\nrings](/wiki/World_Series_ring \"World Series ring\"), Morgan wanted to help\nmake the Astros a pennant winner.\n\nThe 1980 pitching staff was one of the best Houston ever had, with the\nfastball of Ryan, the knuckleball of [Joe Niekro](/wiki/Joe_Niekro \"Joe\nNiekro\") and the terrifying 6 ft 8 in frame of [J. R.\nRichard](/wiki/J._R._Richard \"J. R. Richard\"). Teams felt lucky to face [Ken\nForsch](/wiki/Ken_Forsch \"Ken Forsch\"), who was a double-digit winner in the\nprevious two seasons. Richard became the first Astros pitcher to start an All-\nStar game. After a medical examination three days later, Richard was told to\nrest his arm and he collapsed during a July 30 workout. He had suffered a\nstroke after a blood clot in the arm apparently moved to his neck and cut off\nblood flow to the brain. Surgery was done to save his life, but the Astros had\nlost their ace pitcher after a 10–4 start with a stingy 1.89 ERA. Richard\nattempted a comeback, but would never again pitch a big league game.[23][37]\n\nAfter the loss of Richard and some offensive struggles, the Astros slipped to\nthird place in the division behind the Dodgers and the Reds. They bounced back\nto first with a ten-game winning streak, but the Dodgers had regained a two-\ngame lead when they arrived in Houston on September 9. The Astros won the\nfirst two games of that series and the two teams were tied for the division\nlead. The Astros held a three-game lead over the Dodgers with three games left\nin the season against the Dodgers. The Dodgers swept the series games, forcing\na one-game playoff the next day.[38] The Astros would however win the one-game\nplayoff 7-1, and advance to their first post-season.\n\nThe team would face the [Philadelphia Phillies](/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies\n\"Philadelphia Phillies\") in the [1980 National League Championship\nSeries](/wiki/1980_National_League_Championship_Series \"1980 National League\nChampionship Series\"). The Phillies sent out [Steve\nCarlton](/wiki/Steve_Carlton \"Steve Carlton\") in game one of the NLCS after a\nsix-hour flight the night before.[23][39] The Phillies would win the opener\nafter the Astros got out to a 1-0 third-inning lead. Ken Forsch pitched\nparticularly strong fourth and fifth innings, but [Greg\nLuzinski](/wiki/Greg_Luzinski \"Greg Luzinski\") hit a sixth-inning two-run bomb\nto the 300 level seats of [Veterans Stadium](/wiki/Veterans_Stadium \"Veterans\nStadium\"). The Phillies added an insurance run on the way to a 3–1 win.[6]\nHouston bounced back to win games two and three. Game four went into extra\ninnings, with the Phillies taking the lead and the win in the tenth inning.\n[Pete Rose](/wiki/Pete_Rose \"Pete Rose\") started a rally with a one-out\nsingle, then Luzinski doubled off the left field wall and Rose bowled over\ncatcher Bruce Bochy to score the go-ahead run. The Phillies got an insurance\nrun on the way to tying the series.[6]\n\nRookie Phillies pitcher [Marty Bystrom](/wiki/Marty_Bystrom \"Marty Bystrom\")\nwas sent out by Philadelphia manager [Dallas\nGreen](/wiki/Dallas_Green_\\(baseball\\) \"Dallas Green \\(baseball\\)\") to face\nveteran [Nolan Ryan](/wiki/Nolan_Ryan \"Nolan Ryan\") in Game Five. The rookie\ngave up a run in the first inning, then held the Astros at bay until the sixth\ninning. An Astros lead was lost when [Bob Boone](/wiki/Bob_Boone \"Bob Boone\")\nhit a two-out single in the second, but the Astros tied the game in the sixth\nwith an [Alan Ashby](/wiki/Alan_Ashby \"Alan Ashby\") single scoring [Denny\nWalling](/wiki/Denny_Walling \"Denny Walling\"). Houston took a 5–2 lead in the\nseventh, however the Phillies came back with five runs in the inning. The\nAstros came back against [Tug McGraw](/wiki/Tug_McGraw \"Tug McGraw\") with four\nsingles and two two-out runs. Now in extra innings, [Garry\nMaddox](/wiki/Garry_Maddox \"Garry Maddox\") doubled in [Del\nUnser](/wiki/Del_Unser \"Del Unser\") with one out to give the Phillies an 8–7\nlead. The Astros failed to score in the bottom of the tenth.[6][40]\n\n### 1981–1985[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: 1981–1985\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Nolan_Ryan_in_Atlanta_close-\nup.jpg/220px-Nolan_Ryan_in_Atlanta_close-\nup.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nolan_Ryan_in_Atlanta_close-up.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nolan_Ryan_in_Atlanta_close-up.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAstros starting pitcher [Nolan Ryan](/wiki/Nolan_Ryan \"Nolan Ryan\") in 1983\n\nA 1981 player strike ran between June 12 and August 10. Ultimately, the strike\nwould help the Astros get into the playoffs. [Nolan Ryan](/wiki/Nolan_Ryan\n\"Nolan Ryan\") and [Bob Knepper](/wiki/Bob_Knepper \"Bob Knepper\") picked up\nsteam in the second half of the season. Ryan threw his fifth no-hitter on\nSeptember 26 and finished the season with a 1.69 ERA. Knepper finished with an\nERA of 2.18.[6] In the wake of the strike, Major League Baseball took the\nwinners of each \"half\" season and set up a best-of-five divisional playoff.\nThe [Reds](/wiki/1981_Cincinnati_Reds_season \"1981 Cincinnati Reds season\")\nwon more games than any other team in the National League, but they won\nneither half of the strike-divided season. The\n[Astros](/wiki/1981_Houston_Astros_season \"1981 Houston Astros season\")\nfinished 61–49 overall, which would have been third in the division behind the\nReds and the [Dodgers](/wiki/1981_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_season \"1981 Los Angeles\nDodgers season\"). Advancing to the playoffs as winners of the second half,\nHouston beat Los Angeles in their first two playoff games at home, but the\nDodgers took the next three in Los Angeles to advance to the\n[NLCS](/wiki/1981_National_League_Championship_Series \"1981 National League\nChampionship Series\").\n\nBy [1982](/wiki/1982_Houston_Astros_season \"1982 Houston Astros season\"), only\nfour players and three starting pitchers remained from the 1980 squad. The\nAstros were out of pennant contention by August and began rebuilding for the\nnear future. [Bill Virdon](/wiki/Bill_Virdon \"Bill Virdon\") was fired as\nmanager and replaced by original Colt .45 [Bob Lillis](/wiki/Bob_Lillis \"Bob\nLillis\"). [Don Sutton](/wiki/Don_Sutton \"Don Sutton\") asked to be traded and\nwas sent to the [Milwaukee Brewers](/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers \"Milwaukee\nBrewers\") for cash and the team gained three new prospects, including [Kevin\nBass](/wiki/Kevin_Bass \"Kevin Bass\"). Minor league player [Bill\nDoran](/wiki/Bill_Doran_\\(second_baseman\\) \"Bill Doran \\(second baseman\\)\")\nwas called up in September. Bass also got a look in the outfield. The Astros\nfinished fourth in the west, but new talent was starting to appear.[6]\n\nBefore the [1983 season](/wiki/1983_Houston_Astros_season \"1983 Houston Astros\nseason\"), the Astros traded [Danny Heep](/wiki/Danny_Heep \"Danny Heep\") to the\nMets for pitcher [Mike Scott](/wiki/Mike_Scott_\\(baseball\\) \"Mike Scott\n\\(baseball\\)\"), a 28-year-old who had struggled with New York. [Art\nHowe](/wiki/Art_Howe \"Art Howe\") sat out the 1983 season with an injury,\nforcing [Phil Garner](/wiki/Phil_Garner \"Phil Garner\") to third and [Ray\nKnight](/wiki/Ray_Knight \"Ray Knight\") to first. Doran took over at second,\nbecoming the everyday second baseman for the next seven seasons.[41] The\nAstros finished third in the National League West.[6] The [1984\nseason](/wiki/1984_Houston_Astros_season \"1984 Houston Astros season\") started\noff badly when shortstop [Dickie Thon](/wiki/Dickie_Thon \"Dickie Thon\") was\nhit in the head by a pitch and was lost for the season. In September, the\nAstros called up rookie [Glenn Davis](/wiki/Glenn_Davis_\\(baseball\\) \"Glenn\nDavis \\(baseball\\)\") after he posted impressive numbers in AAA. The Astros\nfinished in second place. In [1985](/wiki/1985_Houston_Astros_season \"1985\nHouston Astros season\"), [Mike Scott](/wiki/Mike_Scott_\\(baseball\\) \"Mike\nScott \\(baseball\\)\") learned a new pitch, the split-finger fastball. Scott,\nwho was coming off of a 5–11 season, had found his new pitch and would become\none of Houston's most celebrated hurlers. In June, Davis made the starting\nlineup at first base, adding power to the team. In September, [Joe\nNiekro](/wiki/Joe_Niekro \"Joe Niekro\") was traded to the Yankees for two minor\nleague pitchers and lefty [Jim Deshaies](/wiki/Jim_Deshaies \"Jim Deshaies\").\nThe Astros finished in fourth place in 1985.[6]\n\n### 1986: Lighting a\nFire[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: 1986: Lighting a Fire\")]\n\nAfter finishing fourth in 1985, the Astros fired general manager [Al\nRosen](/wiki/Al_Rosen \"Al Rosen\") and manager [Bob Lillis](/wiki/Bob_Lillis\n\"Bob Lillis\"). The former was supplanted by [Dick\nWagner](/wiki/Dick_Wagner_\\(baseball\\) \"Dick Wagner \\(baseball\\)\"), the man\nwhose [Reds](/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds \"Cincinnati Reds\") defeated the Astros to\nwin the 1979 NL West title. The latter was replaced by [Hal\nLanier](/wiki/Hal_Lanier \"Hal Lanier\") who, like his manager mentor in St.\nLouis, [Whitey Herzog](/wiki/Whitey_Herzog \"Whitey Herzog\"), had a hard-nosed\napproach to managing and espoused a playing style that focused on pitching,\ndefense, and speed rather than home runs to win games. This style of baseball,\nknown as [Whiteyball](/wiki/Whiteyball \"Whiteyball\"), took advantage of\nstadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, both of which were\ncharacteristics of the Astrodome. Lanier's style of baseball took Houston by\nstorm. Before Lanier took over, fans were accustomed to Houston's occasional\nslow starts, but with Lanier leading the way, Houston got off to a hot start,\nwinning 13 of their first 19 contests.[6][42][43]\n\nPrior to the start of the season the Astros acquired outfielder [Billy\nHatcher](/wiki/Billy_Hatcher \"Billy Hatcher\") from the Cubs for [Jerry\nMumphrey](/wiki/Jerry_Mumphrey \"Jerry Mumphrey\"). Lainer also made a change in\nthe pitching staff, going with a three-man rotation to start the season.

Lainer knew the Astros had talent and he put it to work.[6][44]\n\nThe Astrodome was host to the [1986 All-Star\nGame](/wiki/1986_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game \"1986 Major League\nBaseball All-Star Game\") in which Astros [Mike\nScott](/wiki/Mike_Scott_\\(baseball\\) \"Mike Scott \\(baseball\\)\"), [Kevin\nBass](/wiki/Kevin_Bass \"Kevin Bass\"), [Glenn\nDavis](/wiki/Glenn_Davis_\\(baseball\\) \"Glenn Davis \\(baseball\\)\"), and [Dave\nSmith](/wiki/Dave_Smith_\\(pitcher,_born_1955\\) \"Dave Smith \\(pitcher, born\n1955\\)\") represented the host field. The Astros kept pace with the NL West\nafter the All-Star break. They went on a streak of five straight come-from-\nbehind wins. Houston swept a key 3-game series over the [San Francisco\nGiants](/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants \"San Francisco Giants\") in late September\nto clinch the division title. [Mike Scott](/wiki/Mike_Scott_\\(baseball\\) \"Mike\nScott \\(baseball\\)\") took the mound in the final game of the series and\npitched a no-hitter – the only time in MLB history that any division was\nclinched via a no-hitter. Scott would finish the season with an 18–10 record\nand a [Cy Young Award](/wiki/Cy_Young_Award \"Cy Young Award\").[6][45][46]\n\nThe [1986 National League Championship\nSeries](/wiki/1986_National_League_Championship_Series \"1986 National League\nChampionship Series\") against the [New York Mets](/wiki/New_York_Mets \"New\nYork Mets\") was noted for great drama and is considered one of the best\npostseason series ever.[_[by\nwhom?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] In Game 3, the Astros were ahead\nat [Shea Stadium](/wiki/Shea_Stadium \"Shea Stadium\"), 5–4, in the bottom of\nthe 9th when closer [Dave Smith](/wiki/Dave_Smith_\\(pitcher,_born_1955\\) \"Dave\nSmith \\(pitcher, born 1955\\)\") gave up a two-run home run to [Lenny\nDykstra](/wiki/Lenny_Dykstra \"Lenny Dykstra\"), giving the Mets a dramatic 6–5\nwin.\n\nHowever, the signature game of the series was Game 6. Needing a win to get to\nMike Scott (who had been dominant in the series) in Game 7, the Astros jumped\noff to a 3–0 lead in the first inning but neither team would score again until\nthe 9th inning. In the 9th, starting pitcher [Bob Knepper](/wiki/Bob_Knepper\n\"Bob Knepper\") would give up two runs, and once again the Astros would look to\nDave Smith to close it out. However, Smith would walk [Gary\nCarter](/wiki/Gary_Carter \"Gary Carter\") and [Darryl\nStrawberry](/wiki/Darryl_Strawberry \"Darryl Strawberry\"), giving up a\nsacrifice fly to [Ray Knight](/wiki/Ray_Knight \"Ray Knight\"), tying the game.\nDespite having the go-ahead runs on base, Smith was able to escape the inning\nwithout any further damage.\n\nThere was no scoring until the 14th inning when the Mets would take the lead\non a [Wally Backman](/wiki/Wally_Backman \"Wally Backman\") single and an error\nby left fielder [Billy Hatcher](/wiki/Billy_Hatcher \"Billy Hatcher\"). The\nAstros would get the run back in the bottom of the 14th when Hatcher (in a\nclassic goat-to-hero-conversion-moment) hit one of the most dramatic home runs\nin [NLCS](/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series \"National League\nChampionship Series\") history, off the left field foul pole. In the 16th\ninning, Darryl Strawberry doubled to lead off the inning and Ray Knight drove\nhim home in the next at-bat. The Mets would score a total of three runs in the\ninning to take what appeared an insurmountable 7–4 lead. With their season on\nthe line, the Astros would nonetheless rally for two runs to come to within\n7–6. Kevin Bass came up with the tying and winning runs on base; however\n[Jesse Orosco](/wiki/Jesse_Orosco \"Jesse Orosco\") would strike him out, ending\nthe game. At the time the 16-inning game held the record for the longest in\nMLB postseason history. The Mets won the series, 4-2.\n\n### 1987–1990: Out with the old, in with the\nnew[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: 1987–1990: Out with the old, in with the new\")]\n\nAfter the 1986 season, the team had difficulty finding success again. Several\nchanges occurred. The \"rainbow\" uniforms were phased out, the team electing to\nkeep a five-stripe \"rainbow\" design on the sleeves. From 1987 to 1993, the\nAstros wore the same uniform for both home and away games; the only team in\nMajor League Baseball to do so during that period.[47] Its favorites [Nolan\nRyan](/wiki/Nolan_Ryan \"Nolan Ryan\") and [José Cruz](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Cruz\n\"José Cruz\") [48] moved on and the team entered a rebuilding phase. [Craig\nBiggio](/wiki/Craig_Biggio \"Craig Biggio\") debuted in June 1988, joining new\nprospects [Ken Caminiti](/wiki/Ken_Caminiti \"Ken Caminiti\") and [Gerald\nYoung](/wiki/Gerald_Young_\\(baseball\\) \"Gerald Young \\(baseball\\)\"). Biggio\nwould become the everyday catcher by 1990. A trade acquiring [Jeff\nBagwell](/wiki/Jeff_Bagwell \"Jeff Bagwell\") in exchange for [Larry\nAndersen](/wiki/Larry_Andersen \"Larry Andersen\") would become one of the\nbiggest deals in Astros history. Glenn Davis was traded to\n[Baltimore](/wiki/Baltimore \"Baltimore\") for [Curt\nSchilling](/wiki/Curt_Schilling \"Curt Schilling\"), [Pete\nHarnisch](/wiki/Pete_Harnisch \"Pete Harnisch\") and [Steve\nFinley](/wiki/Steve_Finley \"Steve Finley\") in 1990.1990–1999: Fine tuning\n\nThe early 1990s were marked by the Astros' growing discontent with their home,\nthe Astrodome. After the Astrodome was renovated for the primary benefit of\nthe [NFL](/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\")'s\n[Houston Oilers](/wiki/Houston_Oilers \"Houston Oilers\") (who shared the\nAstrodome with the Astros since the 1960s), the Astros began to grow\nincreasingly disenchanted with the facility. Faced with declining attendance\nat the Astrodome and the inability of management to obtain a new stadium, in\nthe [1991](/wiki/1991_in_baseball \"1991 in baseball\") off-season Astros\nmanagement announced its intention to sell the team and move the franchise to\nthe Washington, D.C. area. However, the move was not approved by other\nNational League owners, thus compelling the Astros to remain in Houston.\nShortly thereafter, McMullen (who also owned the\n[NHL](/wiki/National_Hockey_League \"National Hockey League\")'s [New Jersey\nDevils](/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils \"New Jersey Devils\")) sold the team to Texas\nbusinessman [Drayton McLane](/wiki/Drayton_McLane,_Jr. \"Drayton McLane, Jr.\")\nin 1993, who committed to keeping the team in Houston.\n\nShortly after McLane's arrival, which coincided with the maturation of Bagwell\nand Biggio, the Astros began to show signs of consistent success. After\nfinishing second in their division in 1994 (in a [strike\nyear](/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_Major_League_Baseball_strike \"1994–95 Major League\nBaseball strike\")), 1995, and 1996, the Astros won consecutive division titles\nin 1997, 1998, and 1999. In the 1998 season, the Astros set a team record with\n102 victories. However, each of these titles was followed by a first-round\nplayoff elimination, in [1998](/wiki/1998_National_League_Division_Series\n\"1998 National League Division Series\") by the [San Diego\nPadres](/wiki/San_Diego_Padres \"San Diego Padres\") and in\n[1997](/wiki/1997_National_League_Division_Series \"1997 National League\nDivision Series\") and [1999](/wiki/1999_National_League_Division_Series \"1999\nNational League Division Series\") against the [Atlanta\nBraves](/wiki/Atlanta_Braves \"Atlanta Braves\"). The manager of these title\nteams was [Larry Dierker](/wiki/Larry_Dierker \"Larry Dierker\"), who had\npreviously been a broadcaster and pitcher for the Astros. During this period,\nBagwell, Biggio, [Derek Bell](/wiki/Derek_Bell_\\(baseball\\) \"Derek Bell\n\\(baseball\\)\"), and Sean Berry earned the collective nickname \"The Killer Bs\".\nIn later seasons, the name came to include other Astros, especially [Lance\nBerkman](/wiki/Lance_Berkman \"Lance Berkman\").[49]\n\nCoinciding with the change in ownership, the team switched uniforms and team\ncolors after the [1993](/wiki/1993_in_baseball \"1993 in baseball\") season in\norder to go for a new, more serious image. The team's trademark rainbow\nuniforms were retired, and the team's colors changed to midnight blue and\nmetallic gold. The \"Astros\" font on the team logo was changed to a more\naggressive one, and the team's traditional star logo was changed to a\nstylized, \"flying\" star with an open left end. It marked the first time since\nthe team's inception that orange was not part of the team's colors. Despite\ngeneral agreement that the rainbow uniforms identified with the team had\nbecome tired (and looked too much like a minor league team according to the\nnew owners), the new uniforms and caps were never especially popular with many\nAstros fans.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/HOU_1078.gif/220px-\nHOU_1078.gif)](/wiki/File:HOU_1078.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HOU_1078.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nAstros logo, 1994–1999\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Astros_clinch_playoff_berth%21.jpg/300px-\nAstros_clinch_playoff_berth%21.jpg)](/wiki/File:Astros_clinch_playoff_berth!.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Astros_clinch_playoff_berth!.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFinal Astros regular season game in the Astrodome on October 3, 1999\n\nOff the field, in 1994, the Astros hired one of the first [African\nAmerican](/wiki/African_American \"African American\") general managers, former\nfranchise player [Bob Watson](/wiki/Bob_Watson \"Bob Watson\"). Watson would\nleave the Astros after the 1995 season to become general manager of the [New\nYork Yankees](/wiki/New_York_Yankees \"New York Yankees\") and helped to lead\nthe Yankees to a [World Championship](/wiki/1996_World_Series \"1996 World\nSeries\") in 1996. He would be replaced by [Gerry\nHunsicker](/wiki/Gerry_Hunsicker \"Gerry Hunsicker\"), who until 2004 would\ncontinue to oversee the building of the Astros into one of the better and most\nconsistent organizations in the Major Leagues.\n\nHowever, in 1996, the Astros again nearly left Houston. By the mid-1990s,\nMcLane (like McMullen before him) wanted his team out of the Astrodome and was\nasking the city to build the Astros a new stadium. When things did not\nprogress quickly toward that end, he put the team up for sale. He had nearly\nfinalized a deal to sell the team to businessman William Collins, who planned\nto move them to [Northern Virginia](/wiki/Northern_Virginia \"Northern\nVirginia\"). However, Collins was having difficulty finding a site for a\nstadium himself, so Major League owners stepped in and forced McLane to give\nHouston another chance to grant his stadium wish. Houston voters, having\nalready lost the [Houston Oilers](/wiki/Houston_Oilers \"Houston Oilers\") in a\nsimilar situation, responded positively via a stadium referendum and the\nAstros stayed put.\n\n### 2000–2004: New\nstadium[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: 2000–2004: New stadium\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Houston_Astros_Logo.svg/220px-\nHouston_Astros_Logo.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Houston_Astros_Logo.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Houston_Astros_Logo.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAstros logo, 2000–2012\n\nThe 2000 season saw a move to a new stadium. Originally to be named _The\nBallpark at Union Station_ due to being located on the site of [Union Station\n(Houston)](/wiki/Union_Station_\\(Houston\\) \"Union Station \\(Houston\\)\"), it\nwas renamed _[Enron Field](/wiki/Enron_Field \"Enron Field\")_ by the season\nopening after the naming rights were sold to energy corporation\n[Enron](/wiki/Enron \"Enron\"). The stadium was to feature a retractable roof, a\nparticularly useful feature with unpredictable Houston weather. The ballpark\nalso featured more intimate surroundings than the Astrodome. In 2002, naming\nrights were purchased by Houston-based [Minute Maid](/wiki/Minute_Maid \"Minute\nMaid\"), after [Enron](/wiki/Enron \"Enron\") went bankrupt. The park was built\non the grounds of the old [Union Station](/wiki/Union_Station_\\(Houston\\)\n\"Union Station \\(Houston\\)\"). A locomotive moves across the outfield and\nwhistles after home runs, paying homage to a Houston history which had eleven\nrailroad company lines running through the city by 1860. The ballpark\npreviously contained quirks such as \"Tal's Hill\", which was a hill in deep\ncenter field on which a flagpole stood, all in fair territory. Tal's Hill was\nreplaced in the 2016–2017 offseason. The wall was moved in to 409 feet, which\nthe team hoped would generate more home runs. A similar feature was located in\n[Crosley Field](/wiki/Crosley_Field \"Crosley Field\"). Over the years, many\nhighlight reel catches have been made by center fielders running up the hill\nto make catches. With the change in location also came a change in attire.\nGone were the blue and gold uniforms of the 1990s in favor a more\n\"[retro](/wiki/Retro \"Retro\")\" look with pinstripes, a traditional baseball\nfont, and the colors of brick red, sand and black. These colors were chosen\nbecause ownership originally wanted to rename the team the **Houston\nDiesels**.[50] The \"shooting star\" logo was modified but still retained its\ndefinitive look.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Minute_Maid_Park_2010.JPG/220px-\nMinute_Maid_Park_2010.JPG)](/wiki/File:Minute_Maid_Park_2010.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Minute_Maid_Park_2010.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Astros moved into Minute Maid Park in 2000\n\nAfter two fairly successful seasons without a playoff appearance, the Astros\nwere early favorites to win the 2004 NL pennant. They added star pitcher [Andy\nPettitte](/wiki/Andy_Pettitte \"Andy Pettitte\") to a roster that already\nincluded standouts like [Lance Berkman](/wiki/Lance_Berkman \"Lance Berkman\")\nand [Jeff Kent](/wiki/Jeff_Kent \"Jeff Kent\") as well as veterans Bagwell and\nBiggio. [Roger Clemens](/wiki/Roger_Clemens \"Roger Clemens\"), who had retired\nafter the [2003](/wiki/2003_in_baseball \"2003 in baseball\") season with the\n[New York Yankees](/wiki/New_York_Yankees \"New York Yankees\"), agreed to join\nformer teammate Pettitte on the Astros for 2004. The one-year deal included\nunique conditions, such as the option for Clemens to stay home in Houston on\nselect road trips when he wasn't scheduled to pitch. Despite the early\npredictions for success, the Astros had a mediocre 44–44 record at the All-\nStar break. A lack of run production and a poor record in close games were\nmajor issues. After being booed at the 2004 [All-Star\nGame](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game \"Major League Baseball All-\nStar Game\") held in Houston, manager [Jimy Williams](/wiki/Jimy_Williams \"Jimy\nWilliams\") was fired and replaced by [Phil Garner](/wiki/Phil_Garner \"Phil\nGarner\"), a star on the division-winning 1986 Astros. The Astros enjoyed a\n46–26 record in the second half of the season under Garner and earned the NL\nwild card spot. The Astros defeated the [Braves](/wiki/Atlanta_Braves \"Atlanta\nBraves\") 3–2 in the [Division\nSeries](/wiki/2004_National_League_Division_Series \"2004 National League\nDivision Series\"), but would lose the [National League Championship\nSeries](/wiki/2004_National_League_Championship_Series \"2004 National League\nChampionship Series\") to the [St. Louis Cardinals](/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals\n\"St. Louis Cardinals\") in seven games. Clemens earned a record seventh Cy\nYoung Award in 2004. Additionally, the mid-season addition of [Carlos\nBeltrán](/wiki/Carlos_Beltr%C3%A1n \"Carlos Beltrán\") in a trade with the\n[Kansas City Royals](/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals \"Kansas City Royals\") helped the\nAstros tremendously in their playoff run. Despite midseason trade rumors,\nBeltrán would prove instrumental to the team's hopes, hitting eight home runs\nin the postseason. Though he had asserted a desire to remain with the Astros,\nBeltrán signed a long-term contract with the [New York\nMets](/wiki/New_York_Mets \"New York Mets\") on January 9, 2005.\n\n### 2005: First World Series in\nTexas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: 2005: First World Series in Texas\")]\n\nMain article: [2005 Houston Astros season](/wiki/2005_Houston_Astros_season\n\"2005 Houston Astros season\")\n\nIn 2005, the Astros started poorly and found themselves with a 15-30 record in\nlate May. The [Houston Chronicle](/wiki/Houston_Chronicle \"Houston Chronicle\")\nhad written them off with a tombstone emblazoned with \"RIP 2005 Astros\".\nHowever, from that low point until the end of July, Houston went 42–17 and\nfound themselves in the lead for an NL wild card spot. July saw the best\nsingle month record in the club's history at 22-7. Offensive production had\nincreased greatly after a slow start in the first two months. The Astros had\nalso developed an excellent pitching staff, anchored by [Roy\nOswalt](/wiki/Roy_Oswalt \"Roy Oswalt\") (20–12, 2.94), [Andy\nPettitte](/wiki/Andy_Pettitte \"Andy Pettitte\") (17–9, 2.39), and [Roger\nClemens](/wiki/Roger_Clemens \"Roger Clemens\") (13–8 with a league-low ERA of\nonly 1.87). The contributions of the other starters—[Brandon\nBacke](/wiki/Brandon_Backe \"Brandon Backe\") (10–8, 4.76) and rookie starters\n[Ezequiel Astacio](/wiki/Ezequiel_Astacio \"Ezequiel Astacio\") (3–6, 5.67) and\n[Wandy Rodríguez](/wiki/Wandy_Rodr%C3%ADguez \"Wandy Rodríguez\") (10–10,\n5.53)—were less remarkable, but enough to push the Astros into position for a\nplayoff run. The Astros won a wild card berth on the final day of the regular\nseason, becoming the first team since the world champion 1914 Boston Braves to\nqualify for the postseason after being 15 games under .500.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe Astros won the [National League Division\nSeries](/wiki/2005_National_League_Division_Series \"2005 National League\nDivision Series\") against the [Atlanta Braves](/wiki/Atlanta_Braves \"Atlanta\nBraves\"), 3-1, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings\n(18), most players used by a single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours\nand 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6-1, [Lance\nBerkman](/wiki/Lance_Berkman \"Lance Berkman\") hit an eighth inning grand slam\nto narrow the score to 6–5. In the bottom of the ninth, catcher [Brad\nAusmus](/wiki/Brad_Ausmus \"Brad Ausmus\"), hit a game tying home run that\nallowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth\ninning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but\nwas inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In\nthe top of the fifteenth inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career\nrelief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out [Julio\nFranco](/wiki/Julio_Franco \"Julio Franco\"), at the time the oldest player in\nthe MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the\neighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be\npitching in the nineteenth inning, if it came to that. Clemens struck out, but\nthe next batter, [Chris Burke](/wiki/Chris_Burke_\\(baseball\\) \"Chris Burke\n\\(baseball\\)\"), hit a home run to left field for the Astros win, 7–6. Oddly\nenough, a fan in the \"Crawford Boxes\" in left field had previously caught\nBerkman's grand slam and this same fan caught Burke's home run.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\n[National League Championship\nSeries](/wiki/2005_National_League_Championship_Series \"2005 National League\nChampionship Series\") featured a rematch of the [2004\nNLCS](/wiki/2004_National_League_Championship_Series \"2004 National League\nChampionship Series\"). The Astros lost the first game in [St.\nLouis](/wiki/St._Louis \"St. Louis\"), but would win the next three games, with\nRoy Oswalt getting the win. Though the Astros were poised to close out the\nseries in Game Five in Houston, Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two-out three-\nrun home run to [Albert Pujols](/wiki/Albert_Pujols \"Albert Pujols\"), forcing\nthe series to a sixth game in St. Louis, where the Astros clinched a World\nSeries appearance. [Roy Oswalt](/wiki/Roy_Oswalt \"Roy Oswalt\") was named NLCS\nMVP, having gone 2–0 with a 1.29 ERA in the series. Current honorary NL\nPresident William Y.

Chicago had been considered the slight favorite but would win all\nfour games, the first two at [U.S. Cellular Field](/wiki/U.S._Cellular_Field\n\"U.S. Cellular Field\") in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\") and the final two\nin Houston. Game 3 marked the first World Series game held in the state of\nTexas, and was the longest game in World Series history, lasting 5 hours and\n41 minutes.\n\nThis World Series was marked by a controversy involving the Minute Maid Park\nroof. MLB & Commissioner Bud Selig insisted that the Astros must play with the\nroof open which mitigated the intensity and enthusiasm of the cheering Astros\nfans.[51]\n\n### 2006–2010: The\ndecline[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Houston_Astros&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: 2006–2010: The decline\")]\n\nIn the 2006 offseason, the team signed Preston Wilson and moved Berkman to\nfirst base, ending the long tenure of Jeff Bagwell.

By August, Preston\nWilson complained about his playing time after the return of [Luke\nScott](/wiki/Luke_Scott \"Luke Scott\") from AAA Round Rock. The Astros released\nWilson and he was signed by St. Louis. A dramatic season end included wins in\n10 of their last 12 games, but the Astros missed a playoff appearance when\nthey lost the final game of the season to the Atlanta Braves.\n\nOn October 31, the Astros declined a contract option on [Jeff\nBagwell](/wiki/Jeff_Bagwell \"Jeff Bagwell\") for 2007, ending his 15-year\nAstros career and leading to his retirement. [Roger\nClemens](/wiki/Roger_Clemens \"Roger Clemens\") and [Andy\nPettitte](/wiki/Andy_Pettitte \"Andy Pettitte\") filed for free agency. On\nDecember 12, the Astros traded [Willy Taveras](/wiki/Willy_Taveras \"Willy\nTaveras\"), [Taylor Buchholz](/wiki/Taylor_Buchholz \"Taylor Buchholz\"), and\n[Jason Hirsh](/wiki/Jason_Hirsh \"Jason Hirsh\") to the [Colorado\nRockies](/wiki/Colorado_Rockies \"Colorado Rockies\") for Rockies pitchers\n[Jason Jennings](/wiki/Jason_Jennings \"Jason Jennings\") and [Miguel\nAsencio](/wiki/Miguel_Asencio \"Miguel Asencio\"). A trade with the White Sox,\ninvolving the same three Astros in exchange for Jon Garland, had been nixed a\nfew days earlier when Buchholz reportedly failed a physical.

On June 28, second\nbaseman [Craig Biggio](/wiki/Craig_Biggio \"Craig Biggio\") became the 27th MLB\nplayer to accrue 3,000 career hits. Biggio needed three hits to reach 3,000\nand on that night he had five hits. That night, [Carlos Lee](/wiki/Carlos_Lee\n\"Carlos Lee\") hit a towering walk-off grand slam in the eleventh inning. Lee\nlater quipped to the newsmedia that \"he had hit a walk-off grand slam and he\ngot second billing\", considering Biggio's achievement. On July 24, Biggio\nannounced that he would retire at the end of the season. He hit a grand slam\nin that night's game which broke a 3–3 tie and led to an Astros win.

The Astros struggled throughout a season that was marked by\ntrade-deadline deals that sent longtime Astros to other teams. On July 29, the\nAstros' ace starting pitcher, [Roy Oswalt](/wiki/Roy_Oswalt \"Roy Oswalt\"), was\ndealt to the [Philadelphia Phillies](/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies \"Philadelphia\nPhillies\") for [J.

Cardinals pitcher\n[Chris Carpenter](/wiki/Chris_Carpenter \"Chris Carpenter\") pitched a complete\ngame, two-hit shutout in the game, enabling the Cardinals to win the National\nLeague Wild Card, where they went on to beat the Texas Rangers in the World\nSeries, with [Lance Berkman](/wiki/Lance_Berkman \"Lance Berkman\") being a key\nplayer in their championship victory. The Astros finished with a record of\n56–106, the worst single-season record in franchise history (a record which\nwould be broken the following season).\n\nIn November 2010, Drayton McLane announced that the Astros were being put up\nfor sale. McLane stated that because the Astros were one of the few franchises\nin Major League Baseball with only one family as the owners, he was planning\nhis estate. McLane was 75 years old as of November 2011.[56] In March 2011,\nlocal Houston businessman [Jim Crane](/wiki/Jim_Crane \"Jim Crane\") emerged as\nthe front-runner to purchase the franchise. In the 1980s, Crane founded an air\nfreight business which later merged with [CEVA\nLogistics](/w/index.php?title=CEVA_Logistics&action=edit&redlink=1 \"CEVA\nLogistics \\(page does not exist\\)\"), and later founded Crane Capital Group.\nMcLane and Crane had a previous handshake agreement for the franchise in 2008,\nbut Crane abruptly changed his mind and broke off discussions.

This delayed MLB's\napproval process. During the summer of 2011, a frustrated Crane hinted that\nthe delays might threaten the deal.[58] In October 2011, Crane met personally\nwith MLB Commissioner [Bud Selig](/wiki/Bud_Selig \"Bud Selig\"), in a meeting\nthat was described as \"constructive\".[59]\n\nOn November 15, 2011, it was announced that Crane had agreed to move the\nfranchise to the American League for the 2013 season. The move was part of an\noverall divisional realignment of MLB, with the National and American leagues\neach having 15 teams in three geographically balanced divisions. Crane was\ngiven a $70 million concession by MLB for agreeing to the switch; the move was\na condition for the sale to the new ownership group.[60] Two days later, the\nAstros were officially sold to Crane after the other owners unanimously voted\nin favor of the sale.[2] It was also announced that 2012 would be the last\nseason for the Astros in the NL.[61] After over fifty years of the Astros\nbeing a part of the National League, this move was unpopular with many Astros\nfans.[62][63]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Jose_Altuve_at_MMP_Sept_2013.jpg/220px-\nJose_Altuve_at_MMP_Sept_2013.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jose_Altuve_at_MMP_Sept_2013.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jose_Altuve_at_MMP_Sept_2013.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAstros second baseman [José Altuve](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Altuve \"José Altuve\") in\n2013\n\nIn 2012, the Astros were eliminated from the playoffs before September 5.
