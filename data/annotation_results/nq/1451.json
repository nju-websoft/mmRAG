        "# Quarterback U\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**Quarterback U** is a nickname used by\n[sportswriters](/wiki/Sports_journalist \"Sports journalist\") to refer to\ncolleges that have trained a series of notable football\n[quarterbacks](/wiki/Quarterback \"Quarterback\") (QBs). It is a literary device\ninvoked in the individual discretion of sportswriters and does not represent\nany formal decision-making process or organized sportswriters' poll. Generally\nspeaking, the term implies that many of the school's former quarterbacks later\nhad successful careers in professional football, particularly in the [National\nFootball League](/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\")\n(NFL).\n\nA _Wall Street Journal_ article on November 18, 2012, pointed out that 'Purdue\nmay be the ultimate Quarterback U. Since the 1970 merger (between the AFL and\nNFL), quarterbacks from Purdue have started 724 NFL games, easily the most of\nany major-conference program.' After Purdue QBs' 724 NFL games, the next best\nschools were the University of Washington (623 starts), Miami (573),\nUniversity of Southern California (547) and Notre Dame (543).[1]\n\nIn August 2009, an _[Altoona Mirror](/wiki/Altoona_Mirror \"Altoona Mirror\")_\nwriter sought to name \"Quarterback U\" by player achievements, such as NFL\nstarts, Pro Bowl appearances, and Heisman Trophies won. He noted that, in the\nSuper Bowl era, [USC](/wiki/USC_Trojans_football \"USC Trojans football\") (15),\n[Notre Dame](/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football \"Notre Dame Fighting\nIrish football\") (13), [Washington](/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football\n\"Washington Huskies football\") (12), [Miami](/wiki/Miami_Hurricanes_football\n\"Miami Hurricanes football\") (10), [Stanford](/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal_football\n\"Stanford Cardinal football\") (10), and [UCLA](/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_football\n\"UCLA Bruins football\") (10) produced at least ten starting NFL quarterbacks,\nwhile [Purdue](/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_football \"Purdue Boilermakers\nfootball\") recorded the most combined NFL career starts (704). The article\nconcluded that no single program deserved the title significantly more than\nothers.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Examples\n    * 1.1 Brigham Young University\n    * 1.2 Purdue University\n    * 1.3 Stanford University\n    * 1.4 Texas Tech University\n    * 1.5 University of Maryland\n    * 1.6 University of Miami\n    * 1.7 University of Michigan\n    * 1.8 University of Southern California\n    * 1.9 University of Washington\n  * 2 References\n\n## Examples[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quarterback_U&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Examples\")]\n\n### Brigham Young\nUniversity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quarterback_U&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Brigham Young University\")]\n\nSports writers dubbed the [BYU](/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football \"BYU Cougars\nfootball\") as a Quarterback U from the mid-1980s through the 1990s,[3] during\nwhich time it produced [Jim McMahon](/wiki/Jim_McMahon \"Jim McMahon\"), [Steve\nYoung](/wiki/Steve_Young_\\(American_football\\) \"Steve Young \\(American\nfootball\\)\"), [Gifford Nielsen](/wiki/Gifford_Nielsen \"Gifford Nielsen\"),\n[Robbie Bosco](/wiki/Robbie_Bosco \"Robbie Bosco\") and [Ty\nDetmer](/wiki/Ty_Detmer \"Ty Detmer\"). The _[Deseret News](/wiki/Deseret_News\n\"Deseret News\")_ wrote that the last great BYU signal caller was 2001 [Heisman\nTrophy](/wiki/Heisman_Trophy \"Heisman Trophy\") runner-up [Brandon\nDoman](/wiki/Brandon_Doman \"Brandon Doman\"), who also later served as the\nCougars' [offensive coordinator](/wiki/Offensive_coordinator \"Offensive\ncoordinator\"). It also asserted that, upon Doman's graduation, head coach\n[Gary Crowton](/wiki/Gary_Crowton \"Gary Crowton\") rotated quarterbacks so\nfrequently that it adversely affected their performance.[4][5]\n\n### Purdue\nUniversity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quarterback_U&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Purdue University\")]\n\nIn the 1960s, [Purdue](/wiki/Purdue \"Purdue\") became known as 'Quarterback U'\nand 'Cradle of Quarterbacks' by media and rivals such as [Ohio\nState](/wiki/Ohio_State \"Ohio State\") and [Notre\nDame](/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame \"University of Notre Dame\") due to its\nprominent QBs. Between 1967 and 1974, Purdue QBs [Len Dawson](/wiki/Len_Dawson\n\"Len Dawson\") and [Bob Griese](/wiki/Bob_Griese \"Bob Griese\") started five\n[Super Bowls](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\"), winning three; [Cecil\nIsbell](/wiki/Cecil_Isbell \"Cecil Isbell\") led the [Green Bay\nPackers](/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers \"Green Bay Packers\") to a NFL title in 1939,\n[Elmer Oliphant](/wiki/Elmer_Oliphant \"Elmer Oliphant\") led the [Buffalo All-\nAmericans](/wiki/Buffalo_All-Americans \"Buffalo All-Americans\") to a disputed\nNFL title in 1921; Purdue has produced NFL starting QBs in [Mike\nPhipps](/wiki/Mike_Phipps \"Mike Phipps\"), [Gary\nDanielson](/wiki/Gary_Danielson \"Gary Danielson\"), [Jim\nEverett](/wiki/Jim_Everett \"Jim Everett\"), [Mark Hermann](/wiki/Mark_Hermann\n\"Mark Hermann\"), and [Kyle Orton](/wiki/Kyle_Orton \"Kyle Orton\"); [Scott\nCampbell](/wiki/Scott_Campbell_\\(American_football\\) \"Scott Campbell\n\\(American football\\)\") and [Curtis Painter](/wiki/Curtis_Painter \"Curtis\nPainter\") were well-known backup quarterbacks, [Joey\nElliott](/wiki/Joey_Elliott \"Joey Elliott\") is a starting QB in the [Canadian\nFootball League](/wiki/Canadian_Football_League \"Canadian Football League\").\nThe tradition has continued through to this day with [Drew\nBrees](/wiki/Drew_Brees \"Drew Brees\") winning the [Super Bowl\nXLIV](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLIV \"Super Bowl XLIV\"), in which he was also named\n[MVP](/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award \"Super Bowl Most Valuable\nPlayer Award\").[6][7][8][9][10][11] 15 Purdue QBs went on to the NFL; Purdue\nis tied for first with Alabama in producing Super Bowl winning\nquarterbacks.[12][13] According to ESPN.com, Purdue QBs have won (and\nstarted)[14] more NFL games than any other school; thrown for the most\ntouchdowns and yards in the NFL. Purdue QBs have won more League TD titles (14\nthrough the 2012 NFL season) than any other school.\n\n### Stanford\nUniversity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quarterback_U&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Stanford University\")]\n\nAs early as 1975, the term Quarterback U had been applied to [Stanford\nUniversity](/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal_football \"Stanford Cardinal football\"),\nwhich had produced such players as [Frankie Albert](/wiki/Frankie_Albert\n\"Frankie Albert\"), [John Brodie](/wiki/John_Brodie \"John Brodie\"), [Jim\nPlunkett](/wiki/Jim_Plunkett \"Jim Plunkett\"), [Don Bunce](/wiki/Don_Bunce \"Don\nBunce\"), and [Mike Boryla](/wiki/Mike_Boryla \"Mike Boryla\").[15] This\nreputation was enhanced when [Bill\nWalsh](/wiki/Bill_Walsh_\\(American_football_coach\\) \"Bill Walsh \\(American\nfootball coach\\)\") joined the Cardinal as head coach, and quarterbacks [Guy\nBenjamin](/wiki/Guy_Benjamin \"Guy Benjamin\"), [Steve Dils](/wiki/Steve_Dils\n\"Steve Dils\"), and [Turk Schonert](/wiki/Turk_Schonert \"Turk Schonert\")\npromptly led the NCAA in passing in 1977, 1978, and 1979.[16] They were\nfollowed by perhaps Stanford's best-known quarterback, [John\nElway](/wiki/John_Elway \"John Elway\"), who played at the university from 1979\nto 1982, finishing second in the Heisman voting his senior season.[17] Elway\nwould go on to have a Hall of Fame career with the Broncos and win the Super\nBowl in 1997 and 1998.[18] By 1989, the _[San Jose Mercury\nNews](/wiki/San_Jose_Mercury_News \"San Jose Mercury News\")_ surmised that\nStanford's \"once bright legacy\" as Quarterback U appeared \"to be flickering\nout\".[19] However, recently Stanford's quarterback tradition has experienced\nsomething of a revival under [Andrew Luck](/wiki/Andrew_Luck \"Andrew Luck\").\n[Luck](/wiki/Luck \"Luck\") finished second in the voting for the Heisman\ntrophy, the award given to college football's most outstanding player, in both\n2010 and 2011.[20] When drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in the [2012 NFL\nDraft](/wiki/2012_NFL_Draft \"2012 NFL Draft\"), he became the fourth Stanford\nquarterback taken with the first overall pick, following Elway, Plunkett and\n[Bobby Garrett](/wiki/Bobby_Garrett \"Bobby Garrett\"),[21] but the first since\nElway was taken by the Colts in 1983. Stanford quarterbacks have started 7\nSuper Bowls, winning 4, and garnering two [Super Bowl Most Valuable Player\nAwards](/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award \"Super Bowl Most Valuable\nPlayer Award\").\n\n### Texas Tech\nUniversity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quarterback_U&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Texas Tech University\")]\n\nIn 2005, a _[Sporting News](/wiki/Sporting_News \"Sporting News\")_ writer\ndescribed [Texas Tech](/wiki/Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders_football \"Texas Tech Red\nRaiders football\") as Quarterback U in an article that bestowed several\npositional \"U\" monikers with the criteria being college performance since\n2000. Its author cited head coach [Mike\nLeach](/wiki/Mike_Leach_\\(American_football_coach\\) \"Mike Leach \\(American\nfootball coach\\)\")'s numerous 4,000-yard-plus passers.[22]\n\n### University of\nMaryland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quarterback_U&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: University of Maryland\")]\n\nDuring the 1980s, the term was also applied to\n[Maryland](/wiki/Maryland_Terrapins_football \"Maryland Terrapins football\"),\nwhich produced several NFL-caliber quarterbacks during the tenures of head\ncoach [Bobby Ross](/wiki/Bobby_Ross \"Bobby Ross\") and offensive coordinator\nand quarterbacks/receivers coach [Joe Krivak](/wiki/Joe_Krivak \"Joe Krivak\").\nThese [Maryland quarterbacks](/wiki/Maryland_Terrapins_quarterbacks \"Maryland\nTerrapins quarterbacks\") included [Boomer Esiason](/wiki/Boomer_Esiason\n\"Boomer Esiason\"), [Frank Reich](/wiki/Frank_Reich \"Frank Reich\"), [Neil\nO'Donnell](/wiki/Neil_O%27Donnell \"Neil O'Donnell\"), [Scott\nZolak](/wiki/Scott_Zolak \"Scott Zolak\"), and [Stan\nGelbaugh](/wiki/Stan_Gelbaugh \"Stan Gelbaugh\").[23][24][25] In 2005, _[The\nWashington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_ reapplied\nthe label to the Terrapins under head coach [Ralph\nFriedgen](/wiki/Ralph_Friedgen \"Ralph Friedgen\") and offensive coordinator\n[Charlie Taaffe](/wiki/Charlie_Taaffe \"Charlie Taaffe\"), after [Sam\nHollenbach](/wiki/Sam_Hollenbach \"Sam Hollenbach\") became the [Atlantic Coast\nConference](/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference \"Atlantic Coast Conference\")'s\nleading passer.

In 2008, all three Miami quarterbacks entered the\nseason with no game experience, and pundits charged head coach [Randy\nShannon](/wiki/Randy_Shannon \"Randy Shannon\") with rebuilding the program's\nreputation of producing high-quality signalcallers.[31][32][33]\n\n### University of\nMichigan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quarterback_U&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: University of Michigan\")]\n\nIn recent years, sportswriters have mentioned several schools as being\nappropriate for the designation. A 2005 [ESPN](/wiki/ESPN \"ESPN\") article\ncited that, since 1988, [Michigan](/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football\n\"Michigan Wolverines football\") sent as many starting quarterbacks to the NFL\nas the University of Miami. It argued that \"three yards and a cloud of dust\"\nis no longer the offensive philosophy at Michigan.[34] A year later,\n[Rivals.com](/wiki/Rivals.com \"Rivals.com\") proclaimed that Michigan was \"the\nnew Quarterback U.\"[35][36] [Elvis Grbac](/wiki/Elvis_Grbac \"Elvis Grbac\"),\n[Todd Collins](/wiki/Todd_Collins_\\(quarterback\\) \"Todd Collins\n\\(quarterback\\)\"), [Tom Brady](/wiki/Tom_Brady \"Tom Brady\"), [Jim\nHarbaugh](/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh \"Jim Harbaugh\"), [Brian\nGriese](/wiki/Brian_Griese \"Brian Griese\") and [Chad Henne](/wiki/Chad_Henne\n\"Chad Henne\") are some of the Wolverine quarterbacks who have gone on to start\nin the NFL.[34]\n\n### University of Southern\nCalifornia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quarterback_U&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: University of Southern California\")]\n\nAfter the 2008 season, _[The Los Angeles Times](/wiki/The_Los_Angeles_Times\n\"The Los Angeles Times\")_ claimed that [USC](/wiki/USC_Trojans_football \"USC\nTrojans football\"), more traditionally known as \"Tailback U\", was the school\nmost deserving of the designation.[37][38] In 2009, 4 former USC quarterbacks\nstarted in an NFL game: [Matt Leinart](/wiki/Matt_Leinart \"Matt Leinart\"),\n[Matt Cassell](/wiki/Matt_Cassell \"Matt Cassell\"), [Carson\nPalmer](/wiki/Carson_Palmer \"Carson Palmer\"), and [Mark\nSanchez](/wiki/Mark_Sanchez \"Mark Sanchez\").\n\n### University of\nWashington[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quarterback_U&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: University of Washington\")]\n\n[Washington](/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football \"Washington Huskies football\")\nquarterbacks have consistently advanced to the NFL, with [16 of the previous\n18 starting\nquarterbacks](/wiki/List_of_Washington_Huskies_starting_quarterbacks \"List of\nWashington Huskies starting quarterbacks\") as of 2012 having started in the\nNFL.[39][40] Washington's [Pro Football Hall of\nFame](/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame \"Pro Football Hall of Fame\") member\n[Warren Moon](/wiki/Warren_Moon \"Warren Moon\") is [fourth in all-time passing\nyardage](/wiki/List_of_gridiron_football_quarterbacks_passing_statistics \"List\nof gridiron football quarterbacks passing statistics\"), reflecting his CFL and\nNFL careers.
