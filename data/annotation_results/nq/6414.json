The Act also stipulated the partition of the\n[Provinces of British India](/wiki/Presidencies_and_provinces_of_British_India\n\"Presidencies and provinces of British India\") into two new sovereign\n[dominions](/wiki/Dominion \"Dominion\"): the [Union of\nIndia](/wiki/Union_of_India \"Union of India\") and the [Dominion of\nPakistan](/wiki/Dominion_of_Pakistan \"Dominion of Pakistan\").\n\nThe Indian Independence Act, passed by the British parliament, abandoned the\n[suzerainty](/wiki/Suzerainty \"Suzerainty\") of the British Crown over the\n[princely states](/wiki/Princely_state \"Princely state\") and dissolved the\nIndian Empire, so that the rulers of the states found themselves fully\nindependent and were free to decide for themselves whether to\n[accede](/wiki/Instrument_of_Accession \"Instrument of Accession\") to one of\nthe new dominions or to remain independent.[2]\n\nPakistan was intended as a Muslim homeland, while the [Union of\nIndia](/wiki/Union_of_India \"Union of India\") remained [secular](/wiki/Secular\n\"Secular\"). Muslim-majority British provinces in the north were to become the\nfoundation of Pakistan. The provinces of\n[Baluchistan](/wiki/Balochistan_\\(Pakistan\\) \"Balochistan \\(Pakistan\\)\")\n(91.8% Muslim before partition) and Sindh (72.7%) were granted entirely to\nPakistan. However, two provinces did not have an overwhelming\nmajority—[Bengal](/wiki/Bengal \"Bengal\") in the north-east (54.4% Muslim) and\nthe [Punjab](/wiki/Punjab_region \"Punjab region\") in the north-west (55.7%\nMuslim).[3] The western part of the [Punjab](/wiki/Punjab_\\(British_India\\)\n\"Punjab \\(British India\\)\") became part of [West Pakistan](/wiki/West_Pakistan\n\"West Pakistan\") and the eastern part became the Indian state of [East\nPunjab](/wiki/East_Punjab_\\(state\\) \"East Punjab \\(state\\)\"), which was later\ndivided between a smaller [Punjab State](/wiki/Punjab_\\(India\\) \"Punjab\n\\(India\\)\") and two other states. Bengal was also partitioned, into [East\nBengal](/wiki/East_Bengal \"East Bengal\") (in Pakistan) and [West\nBengal](/wiki/West_Bengal \"West Bengal\") (in India). Following independence,\nthe [North-West Frontier Province](/wiki/North-\nWest_Frontier_Province_\\(1901%E2%80%931955\\) \"North-West Frontier Province\n\\(1901–1955\\)\") (whose borders with [Afghanistan](/wiki/Afghanistan\n\"Afghanistan\") had earlier been demarcated by the [Durand\nLine](/wiki/Durand_Line \"Durand Line\")) voted in a\n[referendum](/wiki/Referendum \"Referendum\") to join Pakistan.[4] This\ncontroversial referendum was boycotted by [the most popular Pukhtun\nmovement](/wiki/Khudai_Khidmatgar \"Khudai Khidmatgar\") in the province at that\ntime. The area is now a province in Pakistan called [Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa](/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa \"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\").\n\nThe Punjab's population distribution was such that there was no line that\ncould neatly divide Hindus, Muslims, and [Sikhs](/wiki/Sikhs \"Sikhs\").\nLikewise, no line could appease the [Muslim League](/wiki/All-\nIndia_Muslim_League \"All-India Muslim League\"), headed by\n[Jinnah](/wiki/Jinnah \"Jinnah\"), and the Indian National Congress led by\n[Jawaharlal Nehru](/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru \"Jawaharlal Nehru\") and [Vallabhbhai\nPatel](/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel \"Vallabhbhai Patel\"), and by the British.\nMoreover, any division based on religious communities was sure to entail\n\"cutting through road and rail communications, irrigation schemes, electric\npower systems and even individual landholdings.\"[5] However, a well-drawn line\ncould minimize the separation of farmers from their fields, and also minimize\nthe numbers of people who might feel forced to relocate.\n\nAs it turned out, on \"the sub-continent as a whole, some 14 million people\nleft their homes and set out by every means possible—by air, train, and road,\nin cars and lorries, in buses and bullock carts, but most of all on foot—to\nseek refuge with their own kind.\"[6] Many of them were slaughtered by an\nopposing side, some starved or died of exhaustion, while others were afflicted\nwith \"[cholera](/wiki/Cholera \"Cholera\"), [dysentery](/wiki/Dysentery\n\"Dysentery\"), and all those other diseases that afflict undernourished\nrefugees everywhere\".[7] Estimates of the number of people who died range\nbetween 200,000 (official British estimate at the time) and two million, with\nthe consensus being around one million dead.[7]\n\n### Prior ideas of\npartition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Prior ideas of partition\")]\n\nThe idea of partitioning the provinces of Bengal and Punjab had been present\nsince the beginning of the 20th century. Bengal had in fact been\n[partitioned](/wiki/Partition_of_Bengal_\\(1905\\) \"Partition of Bengal\n\\(1905\\)\") by the then viceroy [Lord Curzon](/wiki/Lord_Curzon \"Lord Curzon\")\nin 1905, along with its adjoining regions. The resulting 'Eastern Bengal and\nAssam' province, with its capital at [Dhaka](/wiki/Dhaka \"Dhaka\"), had a\nMuslim majority and the 'West Bengal' province, with its capital at\n[Calcutta](/wiki/Calcutta \"Calcutta\"), had a Hindu majority. However, this\npartition of Bengal was reversed in 1911 in an effort to mollify Bengali\nnationalism.[8]\n\nProposals for partitioning Punjab had been made starting from 1908. Its\nproponents included the Hindu leader [Bhai Parmanand](/wiki/Bhai_Parmanand\n\"Bhai Parmanand\"), Congress leader [Lala Lajpat Rai](/wiki/Lala_Lajpat_Rai\n\"Lala Lajpat Rai\"), industrialist [G. D. Birla](/wiki/G._D._Birla \"G. D.\nBirla\"), and various Sikh leaders. After the [Lahore\nresolution](/wiki/Lahore_resolution \"Lahore resolution\") (1940) of the Muslim\nLeague demanding Pakistan, [B. R. Ambedkar](/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar \"B. R.\nAmbedkar\") wrote a 400-page tract titled _Thoughts on Pakistan_ , wherein he\ndiscussed the boundaries of the Muslim and non-Muslim regions of Punjab and\nBengal. His calculations showed a Muslim majority in 16 western districts of\nPunjab and non-Muslim majority in 13 eastern districts. In Bengal, he showed\nnon-Muslim majority in 15 districts. He thought the Muslims could have no\nobjection to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite\n\"understand the nature of their own demand\".[9][10]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Punjab-\nreligion-2.jpg/220px-Punjab-religion-2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Punjab-religion-2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Punjab-religion-2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDistricts of Punjab with Muslim (green) and non-Muslim (pink) majorities, as\nper 1941 census\n\nAfter the breakdown of the 1945 [Simla Conference](/wiki/Simla_Conference\n\"Simla Conference\") of viceroy [Lord\nWavell](/wiki/Archibald_Wavell,_1st_Earl_Wavell \"Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl\nWavell\"), the idea of Pakistan began to be contemplated seriously. Sir [Evan\nJenkins](/wiki/Evan_Meredith_Jenkins \"Evan Meredith Jenkins\"), the private\nsecretary of the viceroy (later the governor of Punjab), wrote a memorandum\ntitled \"Pakistan and the Punjab\", where he discussed the issues surrounding\nthe partition of Punjab. [K. M. Panikkar](/wiki/K._M._Panikkar \"K. M.\nPanikkar\"), then prime minister of the [Bikaner State](/wiki/Bikaner_State\n\"Bikaner State\"), sent a memorandum to the viceroy titled \"Next Step in\nIndia\", wherein he recommended that the British government concede the\nprinciple of 'Muslim homeland' but carry out territorial adjustments to the\nPunjab and Bengal to meet the claims of the Hindus and Sikhs. Based on these\ndiscussions, the viceroy sent a note on \"Pakistan theory\" to the [Secretary of\nState](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_India \"Secretary of State for India\").[11]\nThe viceroy informed the Secretary of State that Jinnah envisaged _full\nprovinces_ of Bengal and Punjab going to Pakistan with only minor adjustments,\nwhereas Congress was expecting _almost half_ of these provinces to remain in\nIndia. This essentially framed the problem of partition.[12]\n\nThe Secretary of State responded by directing Lord Wavell to send 'actual\nproposals for defining genuine Muslim areas'. The task fell on [V. P.\nMenon](/wiki/V._P._Menon \"V. P. Menon\"), the Reforms Commissioner, and his\ncolleague Sir [B. N. Rau](/wiki/B._N._Rau \"B. N. Rau\") in the Reforms Office.\nThey prepared a note called \"Demarcation of Pakistan Areas\", where they\ndefined the western zone of Pakistan as consisting of Sindh, N.W.F.P., British\nBaluchistan and three western divisions of Punjab\n([Rawalpindi](/wiki/Rawalpindi_Division \"Rawalpindi Division\"),\n[Multan](/wiki/Multan_Division \"Multan Division\") and\n[Lahore](/wiki/Lahore_Division \"Lahore Division\")). However, they noted that\nthis allocation would leave 2.2 million Sikhs in the Pakistan area and about\n1.5 million in India. Excluding the [Amritsar](/wiki/Amritsar_district\n\"Amritsar district\") and [Gurdaspur](/wiki/Gurdaspur_district \"Gurdaspur\ndistrict\") districts of the Lahore Division from Pakistan would put a majority\nof Sikhs in India. (Amritsar had a non-Muslim majority and Gurdaspur a\nmarginal Muslim majority.) To compensate for the exclusion of the Gurdaspur\ndistrict, they included the entire [Dinajpur district](/wiki/Dinajpur_district\n\"Dinajpur district\") in the eastern zone of Pakistan, which similarly had a\nmarginal Muslim majority. After receiving comments from John Thorne, member of\nthe Executive Council in charge of Home affairs, Wavell forwarded the proposal\nto the Secretary of State. He justified the exclusion of the Amritsar district\nbecause of its sacredness to the Sikhs and that of Gurdaspur district because\nit had to go with Amritsar for 'geographical reasons'.[13][14][a] The\nSecretary of State commended the proposal and forwarded it to the India and\nBurma Committee, saying, \"I do not think that any better division than the one\nthe Viceroy proposes is likely to be found\".[15]\n\n### Sikh\nconcerns[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Sikh concerns\")]\n\n[![\\[icon\\]](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg) |  **This section needs expansion**.

He espoused the doctrine of self-reliance,\nopposed partition and called for independence on the grounds that no single\nreligious community should control Punjab. Other Sikhs argued that just as\nMuslims feared Hindu domination the Sikhs also feared Muslim domination. Sikhs\nwarned the British government that the morale of Sikh troops in the British\nArmy would be affected if Pakistan was forced on them. Since Hindus seemed\nmore concerned about the rest of India than Punjab, Master Tara Singh refused\nto ally with them and preferred to approach the British directly. Giani Kartar\nSingh drafted the scheme of a separate Sikh state if India was divided.[16]\n\nDuring the Partition developments Jinnah offered Sikhs to live in Pakistan\nwith safeguards for their rights. Sikhs refused because they opposed the\nconcept of Pakistan and also because they were opposed to being a small\nminority within a Muslim majority. There are various reasons for the Sikh\nrefusal to join Pakistan but one clear fact was that the Partition of Punjab\nleft a deep impact on the Sikh psyche with many Sikh holy sites ending up in\nPakistan.[17]\n\nWhile the Congress had insisted for an India which was united and the Muslim\nLeague asked for a separate country, Sikh leader Dr. Vir Singh Bhatti proposed\nthe creation of a separate Sikh state \"Khalistan\".[18] Sikh leaders who were\nunanimous in their opposition to Pakistan wanted a Sikh state to be created.\nMaster Tara Singh wanted the right for an independent Khalistan to federate\nwith either Hindustan or Pakistan. However, the Sikh state being proposed was\nfor an area where no religion was in absolute majority.[19] Negotiations for\nthe independent Sikh state had commenced at the end of World War II and the\nBritish initially agreed but the Sikhs withdrew this demand after pressure\nfrom Indian nationalists.[20] The proposals of the Cabinet Mission Plan had\nseriously jolted the Sikhs because while both the Congress and League could be\nsatisfied the Sikhs saw nothing in it for themselves. as they would be\nsubjected to a Muslim majority. Master Tara Singh protested this to Pethic-\nLawrence on May 5. By early September the Sikh leaders accepted both the long\nterm and interim proposals despite their earlier rejection.[19] The Sikhs\nattached themselves to the Indian state with the promise of religious and\ncultural autonomy.[20]\n\n### Final\nnegotiations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Final negotiations\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Punjab-\nDistricts_1911.png/220px-Punjab-Districts_1911.png)](/wiki/File:Punjab-\nDistricts_1911.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Punjab-Districts_1911.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nPre-partition Punjab province\n\nIn March 1946, the British government sent a [Cabinet\nMission](/wiki/1946_Cabinet_Mission_to_India \"1946 Cabinet Mission to India\")\nto India to find a solution to resolve the conflicting demands of Congress and\nthe Muslim League. Congress agreed to allow Pakistan to be formed with\n'genuine Muslim areas'. The Sikh leaders asked for a Sikh state with\n[Ambala](/wiki/Ambala_Division \"Ambala Division\"),\n[Jalandher](/wiki/Jalandhar_Division \"Jalandhar Division\"),\n[Lahore](/wiki/Lahore_Division \"Lahore Division\") Divisions with some\ndistricts from the [Multan Division](/wiki/Multan_Division \"Multan Division\"),\nwhich, however, did not meet the Cabinet delegates' agreement. In discussions\nwith Jinnah, the Cabinet Mission offered either a 'smaller Pakistan' with all\nthe Muslim-majority districts _except Gurdaspur_ or a 'larger Pakistan' under\nthe sovereignty of the Indian Union.[21] The Cabinet Mission came close to\nsuccess with its proposal for an Indian Union under a federal scheme, but it\nfell apart in the end because of Nehru's opposition to a heavily decentralised\nIndia.[22]\n\nHindus and Sikhs in Punjab and Bengal clamoured for the division of these two\nprovinces, arguing that if India could be divided along religious lines then\nso should these provinces because the Muslim majorities in both provinces were\nsmall.[23] Scholar Akbar Ahmed says that the basic unit of administration in\nIndia was the province and not the district and that the district level\ndivision reduced the principle of partition to absurdity. According to Ahmed,\nsuch a division should have meant that Muslim estates in the United Provinces\nbe separated and given to Pakistan.[24]\n\nScholar Sialkoti writes that V.P Menon decided with Sardar Patel to only give\nMuslims a 'moth-eaten Pakistan'. Nehru then discussed partitioning Punjab and\nBengal with Wavell. Nehru told Menon that the partition of Punjab and Bengal\nwould bring the more fertile parts of these two provinces into the Indian\nUnion so that a truncated Pakistan would not be worth having. [23] Nehru told\nGandhi that ' 'it is unlikely that Jinnah and the Muslim League will agree to\nthis truncated Pakistan which can never succeed economically or otherwise' '.\nSir Cripps remarked ' ' the Pakistan they are likely to get would be very\ndifferent from what they wanted and it may not be worth their while.' _[25] On\nMarch 8 the Congress passed a resolution to divide Punjab.[25]_\n\nIn March 1947, [Lord Mountbatten](/wiki/Lord_Mountbatten \"Lord Mountbatten\")\narrived in India as the next viceroy, with an explicit mandate to achieve\ntransfer of power before June 1948. Scholar Sialkoti states that Mountbatten\nand his staff had already evaluated all the recommendations for the partition\nof Punjab and done their homework prior to their arrival. Within ten days,\nMountbatten's staff had categorically stated that Congress had conceded the\nPakistan demand except for the 13 eastern districts of Punjab (including\nAmritsar and Gurdaspur).[26]\n\nHowever, Jinnah held out. Through a series of six meetings with Mountbatten,\nhe continued to maintain that his demand was for six full provinces. He\n\"bitterly complained\" that the Viceroy was ruining his Pakistan by cutting\nPunjab and Bengal in half as this would mean a 'moth-eaten Pakistan'. But\nMountbatten insisted on a partition.[27]\n\nThe Gurdaspur district remained a key contentious issue for the non-Muslims.\nTheir members of the Punjab legislature made representations to Mountbatten's\nchief of staff [Lord Ismay](/wiki/Lord_Ismay \"Lord Ismay\") as well as the\nGovernor telling them that Gurdaspur was a \"non-Muslim district\". They\ncontended that even if it had a marginal Muslim majority of 51%, which they\nbelieved to be erroneous, the Muslims paid only 35% of the land revenue in the\ndistrict.[28]\n\nIn April, Governor [Evan Jenkins](/wiki/Evan_Meredith_Jenkins \"Evan Meredith\nJenkins\") wrote a note to Mountbatten proposing that Punjab be divided along\nMuslim and non-Muslim majority districts, but \"adjustments could be made by\nagreement\" regarding the tehsils (subdistricts) contiguous to these districts.\nHe proposed that a Boundary Commission be set up consisting of two Muslim and\ntwo non-Muslim members recommended by the Punjab Legislative Assembly. He also\nproposed that a British judge of the High Court be appointed as the chairman\nof the Commission.[29] Jinnah and the Muslim League continued to oppose the\nidea of partitioning the provinces, and the Sikhs were disturbed about the\npossibility of getting only 12 districts (without Gurdaspur). In this context\nthe Partition Plan of 3 June was announced with a notional partition showing\n17 districts of Punjab in Pakistan and 12 districts in India, along with the\nestablishment of a Boundary Commission to decide the final boundary. In\nSialkoti's view, this was done mainly to placate the Sikhs.[30]\n\nMountbatten decided to threaten Jinnah by drawing a line less favourable to\nMuslims and more favourable to Sikhs if he did not agree to partitioning\nPunjab and Bengal. However, Lord Ismay prevailed that he should use 'hurt\nfeelings' rather than threats to persuade Jinnah for partition. They\nultimately succeeded.[31] On the 2nd of June Jinnah once again approached\nMountbatten to plead for the unity of Punjab and Bengal but Mountbatten\nthreatened that ' 'You will lose Pakistan probably for good.' '[24]\n\n## Process and key\npeople[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Process and key people\")]\n\nA crude border had already been drawn up by [Lord\nWavell](/wiki/Archibald_Wavell,_1st_Earl_Wavell \"Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl\nWavell\"), the [Viceroy of India](/wiki/Viceroy_of_India \"Viceroy of India\")\nprior to his replacement as Viceroy, in February 1947, by [Lord Louis\nMountbatten.](/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma \"Louis\nMountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma\") In order to determine exactly\nwhich territories to assign to each country, in June 1947, Britain appointed\n[Sir Cyril Radcliffe](/wiki/Sir_Cyril_Radcliffe \"Sir Cyril Radcliffe\") to\nchair two Boundary Commissions—one for Bengal and one for Punjab.[32]\n\nThe Commission was instructed to \"demarcate the boundaries of the two parts of\nthe Punjab on the basis of ascertaining the contiguous majority areas of\nMuslims and non-Muslims. In doing so, it will also take into account other\nfactors.\"[33] Other factors were undefined, giving Radcliffe leeway, but\nincluded decisions regarding \"natural boundaries, communications, watercourses\nand irrigation systems\", as well as socio-political consideration.[34] Each\ncommission also had 4 representatives—2 from the [Indian National\nCongress](/wiki/Indian_National_Congress \"Indian National Congress\") and 2\nfrom the [Muslim League](/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League \"All-India Muslim\nLeague\"). Given the deadlock between the interests of the two sides and their\nrancorous relationship, the final decision was essentially Radcliffe's.\n\nAfter arriving in India on 8 July 1947, Radcliffe was given just five weeks to\ndecide on a border.[32] He soon met with his fellow college alumnus\nMountbatten and travelled to [Lahore](/wiki/Lahore \"Lahore\") and\n[Calcutta](/wiki/Calcutta \"Calcutta\") to meet with commission members, chiefly\nNehru from the Congress and Jinnah, president of the Muslim League.[35] He\nobjected to the short time frame, but all parties were insistent that the line\nbe finished by the 15 August British withdrawal from India. Mountbatten had\naccepted the post as Viceroy on the condition of an early deadline.[36] The\ndecision was completed just a couple of days before the withdrawal, but due to\npolitical manoeuvring, not published until 17 August 1947, two days after the\ngrant of independence to India and Pakistan.[32]\n\n### Members of the\nCommissions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Members of the Commissions\")]\n\nEach boundary commission consisted of 5 people – a chairman\n([Radcliffe](/wiki/Cyril_Radcliffe,_1st_Viscount_Radcliffe \"Cyril Radcliffe,\n1st Viscount Radcliffe\")), 2 members nominated by the [Indian National\nCongress](/wiki/Indian_National_Congress \"Indian National Congress\") and 2\nmembers nominated by the [Muslim League](/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League \"All-\nIndia Muslim League\").[37]\n\nThe Bengal Boundary Commission consisted of Justices C.

They had no\nadvisers to inform them of the well-established procedures and information\nneeded to draw a boundary. Nor was there time to gather the survey and\nregional information. The absence of some experts and advisers, such as the\nUnited Nations, was deliberate, to avoid delay.[39] Britain's new Labour\ngovernment \"deep in wartime debt, simply couldn’t afford to hold on to its\nincreasingly unstable empire.\"[40] \"The absence of outside participants—for\nexample, from the United Nations—also satisfied the British Government's\nurgent desire to save face by avoiding the appearance that it required outside\nhelp to govern—or stop governing—its own empire.\"[41]\n\n### Political\nrepresentation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Political representation\")]\n\nThe equal representation given to politicians from Indian National Congress\nand the Muslim League appeared to provide balance, but instead created\ndeadlock. The relationships were so tendentious that the judges \"could hardly\nbear to speak to each other\", and the agendas so at odds that there seemed to\nbe little point anyway. Even worse, \"the wife and two children of the Sikh\njudge in Lahore had been murdered by Muslims in Rawalpindi a few weeks\nearlier.\"[42]\n\nIn fact, minimizing the numbers of Hindus and Muslims on the wrong side of the\nline was not the only concern to balance. The Punjab Border Commission was to\ndraw a border through the middle of an area home to the Sikh community.[43]\nLord Islay was rueful for the British not to give more consideration to the\ncommunity who, in his words, had \"provided many thousands of splendid recruits\nfor the Indian Army\" in its service for the crown in World War I.[44] However,\nthe Sikhs were militant in their opposition to any solution which would put\ntheir community in a Muslim ruled state. Moreover, many insisted on their own\nsovereign state, something no-one else would agree to.[45]\n\nLast of all, were the communities without any representation. The Bengal\nBorder Commission representatives were chiefly concerned with the question of\nwho would get Calcutta. The Buddhist tribes in the [Chittagong Hill\nTracts](/wiki/Chittagong_Hill_Tracts \"Chittagong Hill Tracts\") in Bengal had\nno official representation and were left totally without information to\nprepare for their situation until two days after the partition.[46]\n\nPerceiving the situation as intractable and urgent, Radcliffe went on to make\nall the difficult decisions himself. This was impossible from inception, but\nRadcliffe seems to have had no doubt in himself and raised no official\ncomplaint or proposal to change the circumstances.[1]\n\n### Local\nknowledge[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Local knowledge\")]\n\nBefore his appointment, Radcliffe had never visited India and knew no one\nthere. To the British and the feuding politicians alike, this neutrality was\nlooked upon as an asset; he was considered to be unbiased toward any of the\nparties, except of course Britain.[1] Only his private secretary, Christopher\nBeaumont, was familiar with the administration and life in the Punjab. Wanting\nto preserve the appearance of impartiality, Radcliffe also kept his distance\nfrom [Viceroy Mountbatten](/wiki/Lord_Mountbatten \"Lord Mountbatten\").[5]\n\nNo amount of knowledge could produce a line that would completely avoid\nconflict; already, \"sectarian riots in Punjab and Bengal dimmed hopes for a\nquick and dignified British withdrawal\".[47] \"Many of the seeds of\npostcolonial disorder in South Asia were sown much earlier, in a century and\nhalf of direct and indirect British control of large part of the region, but,\nas book after book has demonstrated, nothing in the complex tragedy of\npartition was inevitable.\"[48]\n\n### Haste and\nindifference[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Haste and indifference\")]\n\nRadcliffe justified the casual division with the [truism](/wiki/Truism\n\"Truism\") that no matter what he did, people would suffer. The thinking behind\nthis justification may never be known since Radcliffe \"destroyed all his\npapers before he left India\".[49] He departed on Independence Day itself,\nbefore even the boundary awards were distributed. By his own admission,\nRadcliffe was heavily influenced by his lack of fitness for the Indian climate\nand his eagerness to depart India.[50]\n\nThe implementation was no less hasty than the process of drawing the border.\nOn 16 August 1947 at 5:00 pm, the Indian and Pakistani representatives were\ngiven two hours to study copies, before the Radcliffe award was published on\n17 August.[51]\n\n### Secrecy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Secrecy\")]\n\nTo avoid disputes and delays, the division was done in secret. The final\nAwards were ready on 9 August and 12 August, but not published until two days\nafter the partition.\n\nAccording to Read and Fisher, there is some circumstantial evidence that Nehru\nand Patel were secretly informed of the Punjab Award's contents on August 9 or\n10, either through Mountbatten or Radcliffe's Indian assistant secretary.[52]\nRegardless of how it transpired, the award was changed to put a salient east\nof the Sutlej canal within India's domain instead of Pakistan's. This area\nconsisted of two Muslim-majority tehsils with a combined population of over\nhalf a million. There were two apparent reasons for the switch: the area\nhoused an army arms depot, and contained the headwaters of a canal which\nirrigated the princely state of Bikaner, which would accede to\nIndia.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n###\nImplementation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Implementation\")]\n\nAfter the partition, the fledgling governments of India and Pakistan were left\nwith all responsibility to implement the border. After visiting Lahore in\nAugust, Viceroy Mountbatten hastily arranged a [Punjab Boundary\nForce](/wiki/Punjab_Boundary_Force \"Punjab Boundary Force\") to keep the peace\naround Lahore, but 50,000 men was not enough to prevent thousands of killings,\n77% of which were in the rural areas. Given the size of the territory, the\nforce amounted to less than one soldier per square mile. This was not enough\nto protect the cities much less the caravans of the hundreds of thousands of\nrefugees who were fleeing their homes in what would become Pakistan.[53]\n\nBoth India and Pakistan were loath to violate the agreement by supporting the\nrebellions of villages drawn on the wrong side of the border, as this could\nprompt a loss of face on the international stage and require the British or\nthe UN to intervene. Border conflicts led to three wars, in [1947](/wiki/Indo-\nPakistani_War_of_1947 \"Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\"), [1965](/wiki/Indo-\nPakistani_War_of_1965 \"Indo-Pakistani War of 1965\"), and [1971](/wiki/Indo-\nPakistani_War_of_1971 \"Indo-Pakistani War of 1971\"), and the [Kargil conflict\nof 1999](/wiki/Kargil_War \"Kargil War\").\n\n## Disputes along the Radcliffe\nLine[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Disputes along the Radcliffe Line\")]\n\nThere were disputes regarding the Radcliffe Line's award of the [Chittagong\nHill Tracts](/wiki/Chittagong_Hill_Tracts \"Chittagong Hill Tracts\") and the\n[Gurdaspur district](/wiki/Gurdaspur_district \"Gurdaspur district\"). Disputes\nalso evolved around the districts of [Malda](/wiki/Malda_district \"Malda\ndistrict\"), [Khulna](/wiki/Khulna \"Khulna\"), and\n[Murshidabad](/wiki/Murshidabad \"Murshidabad\") in Bengal and the sub-division\nof [Karimganj](/wiki/Karimganj \"Karimganj\") of Assam.\n\nIn addition to Gurdaspur's Muslim majority tehsils, Radcliffe also gave the\nMuslim majority tehsils of Ajnala (Amritsar District), Zira, Ferozpur (in\nFerozpur District), Nakodar and Jullander (in Jullander District) to India\ninstead of Pakistan.[54]\n\n### Punjab[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Punjab\")]\n\n#### Ferozpur\nDistrict[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Ferozpur District\")]\n\nIndian historians now accept that Mountbatten probably did influence the\nFerozpur award in India's favour.[55]\n\n#### Gurdaspur\nDistrict[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit\nsection: Gurdaspur District\")]\n\nUnder [British control](/wiki/British_Raj \"British Raj\"), the Gurdaspur\ndistrict was the northernmost district of the [Punjab\nProvince](/wiki/Punjab_Province_\\(British_India\\) \"Punjab Province \\(British\nIndia\\)\"). The district itself was administratively subdivided into four\n[tehsils](/wiki/Tehsils \"Tehsils\"): [Shakargarh](/wiki/Shakargarh_Tehsil\n\"Shakargarh Tehsil\") and [Pathankot](/wiki/Pathankot_district \"Pathankot\ndistrict\") tehsils to the north, and [Gurdaspur and Batala\ntehsils](/wiki/Gurdaspur_district \"Gurdaspur district\") to the south. Of the\nfour, only the Shakargarh tehsil, which was separated from the rest of the\ndistrict by the [Ravi river](/wiki/Ravi_river \"Ravi river\"), was awarded to\nPakistan. (It was subsequently merged into the [Narowal\ndistrict](/wiki/Narowal_District \"Narowal District\") of [West\nPunjab](/wiki/West_Punjab \"West Punjab\").[56]) The Gurdaspur, Batala and\nPathankot tehsils became part of India's [East Punjab\nstate](/wiki/East_Punjab_\\(state\\) \"East Punjab \\(state\\)\"). The division of\nthe district was followed by a population transfer between the two nations,\nwith Muslims leaving for Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs leaving for India.\n\nThe entire district of Gurdaspur had a bare majority of 50.2% Muslims.[57] (In\nthe `notional' award attached to the Indian Independence Act, all of Gurdaspur\ndistrict was marked as Pakistan with 51.14% Muslim majority.[58] In the 1901\ncensus, the population of Gurdaspur district was 49% Muslim, 40% Hindu, and\n10% Sikh.[59]) The Pathankot tehsil was predominantly Hindu while the other\nthree tehsils were Muslim majority.[60] In the event, only Shakargarh was\nawarded to Pakistan.\n\nRadcliffe explained that the reason for deviating from the notional award in\ncase of Gurdaspur was that the headwaters of the canals that irrigated the\nAmritsar district lay in the Gurdaspur district and it was important to keep\nthem under one administration.[58] Lord Wavell had stated in February 1946\nthat Gurdaspur had to go with the Amritsar district, and the latter could not\nbe in Pakistan due to its Sikh religious shrines.[58] In addition, the railway\nline from Amritsar to Pathankot passed through the Batala and Gurdaspur\ntehsils.[61]\n\nPakistanis have alleged that the award of the three tehsils to India was a\nmanipulation of the Award by Lord Mountbatten in an effort to provide a land\nroute for India to [Jammu and\nKashmir](/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_\\(princely_state\\) \"Jammu and Kashmir\n\\(princely state\\)\").[57] However, Shereen Ilahi points out that the land\nroute to Kashmir was entirely within the Pathankot tehsil, which had a Hindu\nmajority. The award of the Batala and Gurdaspur tehsils to India did not\naffect Kashmir.[62]\n\n#### Pakistani View on the Award of Gurdaspur to\nIndia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: Pakistani View on the Award of Gurdaspur to India\")]\n\nPakistan maintains that the Radcliffe Award was altered by\n[Mountbatten](/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten \"Louis Mountbatten\"); Gurdaspur was\nhanded over to India and thus was manipulated the accession of Kashmir to\nIndia.[63][_[not in citation given](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_] As per the `notional' award that had already been\nput into effect for purposes of administration ad interim, all of Gurdaspur\ndistrict, owing to its Muslim majority, was assigned to Pakistan.[64] From\nAugust 14th to 17th, Mushtaq Ahmed Cheema acted as the [Deputy\nCommissioner](/wiki/Deputy_commissioner#India_and_Pakistan \"Deputy\ncommissioner\") of the Gurdaspur District, but when, after a delay of two days,\nit was announced that the major portion of the district had been awarded to\nIndia instead of Pakistan, Cheema left for Pakistan.[65] The major part of\nGurdaspur district, i.e. three of the four sub-districts and a small part of\nthe fourth, had been handed over to India giving India practical land access\nto Kashmir, thus making the Indian intervention in Kashmir possible.[66] It\ncame as a great blow to Pakistan. Jinnah and other leaders of Pakistan, and\nparticularly its officials, criticized the Award as ‘extremely unjust and\nunfair’.[67][_[need quotation to verify](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\n[Muhammad Zafarullah Khan](/wiki/Muhammad_Zafarullah_Khan \"Muhammad Zafarullah\nKhan\"), who represented the Muslim League in July 1947 before the Radcliffe\nBoundary Commission, stated that the Boundary Commission was a farce. A secret\ndeal between Mountbatten and Congress leaders had already been struck.[68]\n[Mehr Chand Mahajan](/wiki/Mehr_Chand_Mahajan \"Mehr Chand Mahajan\"), one of\nthe two Non Muslim members of the Boundary Commission, in his autobiography,\nhas acknowledged that when he was selected for the boundary commission, he was\nnot inclined to accept the invitation as he believed that the commission was\njust a farce and that decisions were actually to be taken by Mountbatten\nhimself.[69] It was only under British pressure that the charges against\nMountbatten of last minute alterations in the Radcliffe Award were not\nofficially brought forward by Pakistani Government in the UN Security Council\nwhile presenting its case on Kashmir.[70]\n\nZafrullah Khan states that, in actual fact, adopting the tehsil as a unit\nwould have given Pakistan the Ferozepur and Zira tehsils of the Ferozpur\nDistrict, the Jullundur and Rahon tehsils of Jullundur district and the Dasuya\ntehsil of the Hoshiarpur district. The line so drawn would also give Pakistan\nthe State of Kapurthala (which had a Muslim majority) and would enclose within\nPakistan the whole of the Amritsar district of which only one tehsil, Ajnala,\nhad a Muslim majority. It would also give Pakistan the Shakargarh, Batala and\nGurdaspur tehsils of the Gurdaspur district. If the boundary went by Doabs,\nPakistan could get not only the 16 districts which had already under the\nnotional partition been put into West Punjab, including the Gurdaspur\nDistrict, but also get the Kangra District in the mountains, to the north and\neast of Gurdaspur. Or one could go by Commissioners' divisions. Any of these\nunits being adopted would have been more favourable to Pakistan than the\npresent boundary line. The tehsil was the most favourable unit.[64] But all of\nthe aforementioned Muslim majority tehsils, with the exception of Shakargarh,\nwere handed over to India while Pakistan didn't receive any Non-Muslim\nmajority district or tehsil in Punjab.[54] Zafruallh Khan states that\nRadcliffe used district, tehsil, thana, and even village boundaries to divide\nPunjab in such a way that the boundary line was drawn much to the prejudice of\nPakistan.[64]\n\nAccording to Zafrullah Khan, the assertion that the award of the Batala and\nGurdaspur tehsils to India did not 'affect' Kashmir is far-fetched. If Batala\nand Gurdaspur had gone to Pakistan, Pathankot tehsil would have been isolated\nand blocked. Even though it would have been possible for India to get access\nto Pathankot through the Hoshiarpur district, it would have taken quite long\ntime to construct the roads, bridges and communications that would have been\nnecessary for military movements.[66]\n\n#### Assessments on the 'Controversial Award of Gurdaspur to India and the\nKashmir\nDispute'[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit\nsection: Assessments on the 'Controversial Award of Gurdaspur to India and the\nKashmir Dispute'\")]\n\n[Stanley Wolpert](/wiki/Stanley_Wolpert \"Stanley Wolpert\") writes that\nRadcliffe in his initial maps awarded Gurdaspur district to Pakistan but one\nof Nehru’s and Mountbatten’s greatest concerns over the new Punjab border was\nto make sure that Gurdaspur would not go to Pakistan, since that would have\ndeprived India of direct road access to Kashmir.[71] As per \"The Different\nAspects of Islamic Culture\", a part of [UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO \"UNESCO\")’s\nHistories flagship project, recently disclosed documents of the history of the\npartition reveal British complicity with the top Indian leadership to wrest\nKashmir from Pakistan. Alastair Lamb, based on the study of recently\ndeclassified documents, has convincingly proven that Mountbatten, in league\nwith Nehru, was instrumental in pressurizing Radcliffe to award the Muslim-\nmajority district of Gurdaspur in East Punjab to India which could provide\nIndia with the only possible access to Kashmir.[72] [Andrew\nRoberts](/wiki/Andrew_Roberts_\\(historian\\) \"Andrew Roberts \\(historian\\)\")\nbelieves that Mountbatten cheated over India-Pak frontier[73] and states that\nif gerrymandering took place in the case of Ferozepur, it is not too hard to\nbelieve that Mountbatten also pressurized Radcliffe to ensure that Gurdaspur\nwound up in India to give India road access to Kashmir.[74][75][76]\n\n[Perry Anderson](/wiki/Perry_Anderson \"Perry Anderson\") states that\nMountbatten, who was officially supposed to neither exercise any influence on\nRadcliffe nor to have any knowledge of his findings, intervened behind the\nscenes – probably at Nehru’s behest – to alter the award. He had little\ndifficulty in getting Radcliffe to change his boundaries to allot the Muslim-\nmajority district of Gurdaspur to India instead of Pakistan, thus giving India\nthe only road access from Delhi to Kashmir.[77]\n\nHowever, some British works suggest that the 'Kashmir State was not in\nanybody's mind'[78] when the Award was being drawn and that even the\nPakistanis themselves had not realized the importance of Gurdaspur to Kashmir\nuntil the Indian forces actually entered Kashmir.[79] Both Mountbatten and\nRadcliffe, of course, have strongly denied those charges. It is impossible to\naccurately quantify the personal responsibility for the tragedy of Kashmir as\nthe Mountbatten papers relating to the issue at the India Office Library and\nrecords are closed to scholars for an indefinite period.[80]\n\n### Bengal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Bengal\")]\n\n#### Chittagong Hill\nTracts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit\nsection: Chittagong Hill Tracts\")]\n\n[Chittagong Hill Tracts](/wiki/Chittagong_Hill_Tracts \"Chittagong Hill\nTracts\") had a majority non-Muslim population of 97% (most of them\n[Buddhists](/wiki/Buddhists \"Buddhists\")), but was given to Pakistan. The\nChittagong Hill Tracts People's Association (CHTPA) petitioned the Bengal\nBoundary Commission that, since the CHTs were inhabited largely by non-\nMuslims, they should remain within India. Since they had no official\nrepresentation, there was no official discussion on the matter, and many on\nthe Indian side assumed the CHT would be awarded to India.\n\nOn 15 August 1947, many of the tribes did not know to which side of the border\nthey belonged. On 17 August, the publication of the Radcliffe Award put the\nCHTs in Pakistan. The rationale of giving the Chittagong Hill Tracts to\nPakistan was that they were inaccessible to India and to provide a substantial\nrural [buffer](/wiki/Buffer_zone \"Buffer zone\") to support\n[Chittagong](/wiki/Chittagong \"Chittagong\") (now in\n[Bangladesh](/wiki/Bangladesh \"Bangladesh\")), a major city and port; advocates\nfor Pakistan forcefully argued to the Bengal Boundary Commission that the only\napproach was through Chittagong.\n\nTwo days later, the CHTPA resolved not to abide by the award and hoisted the\nIndian flag. The Pakistani army dealt with the protest but its\n[polemic](/wiki/Polemic \"Polemic\") somewhat remains with some of its non-\nMuslim majority arguing for its secession.[81]\n\n#### Malda\nDistrict[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit\nsection: Malda District\")]\n\nAnother disputed decision made by Radcliffe was division of the [Malda\ndistrict](/wiki/Malda_district \"Malda district\") of [Bengal](/wiki/Bengal\n\"Bengal\"). The district overall had a slight Muslim majority, but was divided\nand most of it, including Malda town, went to India. The district remained\nunder East Pakistan administration for 3–4 days after 15 August 1947. It was\nonly when the award was made public that the Pakistani flag was replaced by\nthe Indian flag in Malda.\n\n#### Khulna and Murshidabad\nDistricts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Khulna and Murshidabad Districts\")]\n\nThe entire [Khulna District](/wiki/Khulna_District \"Khulna District\") with a\nmarginal Hindu majority of 51% was also given to East Pakistan in lieu of a\nsmaller [Murshidabad district](/wiki/Murshidabad_district \"Murshidabad\ndistrict\") with a 70% Muslim majority, which went to India.\n\n#### Karimganj[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Karimganj\")]\n\n[Sylhet](/wiki/Sylhet \"Sylhet\") district of [Assam](/wiki/Assam \"Assam\")\njoined Pakistan in accordance with a referendum.[82] However, the\n[Karimganj](/wiki/Karimganj \"Karimganj\") sub-division with a Muslim majority\nwas severed from Sylhet and given to India. As of the 2001 Indian Census,\nKarimganj now has a Muslim majority of 52.3%.\n\n## Legacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Legacy\")]\n\n### Legacy and\nhistoriography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Radcliffe_Line&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Legacy and historiography\")]\n\nThe Partition of India is one of the central events in the collective memory\nin India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

The specific commemoration of the\naward or the recounting of the story of the process and the people involved in\nit has been comparatively rare.\n\nOne notable depiction is _[Drawing the Line](/wiki/Drawing_the_Line_\\(play\\)\n\"Drawing the Line \\(play\\)\")_ , written by British playwright Howard Brenton.\nDefending his portrayal of Cyril Radcliffe as a man who struggled with his\nconscience, Brenton said, \"There were clues that Radcliffe had a dark night of\nthe soul in the bungalow: he refused to accept his fee, he did collect all the\npapers and draft maps, took them home to England and burnt them. And he\nrefused to say a word, even to his family, about what happened.

But in the British elections at the end of the war, the reactionaries unexpectedly lost to the Labour Party, and a new era in British politics began. As von Tunzelmann writes, 'By 1946, the subcontinent was a mess, with British civil and military officers desperate to leave, and a growing hostility to their presence among Indians.' ... The British could not now rely on brute force without imperiling their own sense of legitimacy. Besides, however much they 'preferred the illusion of imperial might to the admission of imperial failure,' as von Tunzelmann puts it, the country, deep in wartime debt, simply couldn’t afford to hold on to its increasingly unstable empire.
