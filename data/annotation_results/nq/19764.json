Each province has\nits own ruler, but the realm itself has always been ruled by a single monarch.\nAfter [The Marvelous Land of Oz](/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz \"The Marvelous\nLand of Oz\"), this monarch is [Princess Ozma](/wiki/Princess_Ozma \"Princess\nOzma\").\n\nOriginally, Baum did not intend for [The Wonderful Wizard of\nOz](/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\") to have any\nsequels, but it achieved a greater popularity than any of the other fairylands\nhe created, including the land of [Merryland](/wiki/Merryland_\\(Oz\\)\n\"Merryland \\(Oz\\)\") in Baum's children's novel _[Dot and Tot in\nMerryland](/wiki/Dot_and_Tot_of_Merryland \"Dot and Tot of Merryland\")_ ,\nwritten a year later. Due to Oz's worldwide success, Baum decided to return to\nit four years after The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was published. For the next two\ndecades, he described and expanded upon the land in [the Oz\nBooks](/wiki/List_of_Oz_books \"List of Oz books\"),[2] a series which\nintroduced many fictional characters and creatures. Baum intended to end the\nseries with the sixth Oz book _[The Emerald City of\nOz](/wiki/The_Emerald_City_of_Oz \"The Emerald City of Oz\")_ (1910), in which\nOz is forever sealed off and made invisible to the outside world, but this did\nnot sit well with fans, and he quickly abandoned the idea, writing eight more\nsuccessful Oz books, and even naming himself the \"Royal Historian of Oz\".[3]\n\nIn all, Baum wrote fourteen best-selling [children's\nbooks](/wiki/Children%27s_books \"Children's books\") about Oz and its enchanted\ninhabitants, as well as a spin off-series of [six early\nreaders](/wiki/Little_Wizard_Stories_of_Oz \"Little Wizard Stories of Oz\").\nAfter his death in 1919, author [Ruth Plumly\nThompson](/wiki/Ruth_Plumly_Thompson \"Ruth Plumly Thompson\"), illustrator\n[John R. Neill](/wiki/John_R._Neill \"John R. Neill\") (who had previously\ncollaborated with Baum on his Oz books) and several other writers and artists\ncontinued the series. There are now over 50 novels based upon Baum's original\nOz saga.\n\nBaum characterized Oz as a real place, unlike [MGM's 1939 musical movie\nadaptation](/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_\\(1939_film\\) \"The Wizard of Oz \\(1939\nfilm\\)\"), which presents it as a dream of lead character [Dorothy\nGale](/wiki/Dorothy_Gale \"Dorothy Gale\"). According to the Oz books, it is a\nhidden fairyland cut off from the rest of the world by a [deadly\ndesert](/w/index.php?title=Deadly_desert&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Deadly desert\n\\(page does not exist\\)\").[4]\n\nThe canonical [demonym](/wiki/Demonym \"Demonym\") for Oz is \"Ozite\". The term\nappears in _Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz_ , _The Road to Oz_ , and _The\nEmerald City of Oz_. Elsewhere in the canon, \"Ozmie\" is also used. In the\nanimated 1974 semi-sequel to the MGM film, _[Journey Back to\nOz](/wiki/Journey_Back_to_Oz \"Journey Back to Oz\")_ , \"Ozonian\" is used. The\nterm \"Ozian\" appears in the script for the Royal Shakespeare Company's stage\nadaptation of the MGM movie and in the non-canonical modern work\n_[Wicked](/wiki/Wicked_\\(musical\\) \"Wicked \\(musical\\)\")_. \"Ozmite\" was used\nin [Reilly & Lee](/wiki/Reilly_%26_Lee \"Reilly & Lee\") marketing in the 1920s,\nwhich has suggested to some critics that \"Ozmie\" may have been a\n[typographical error](/wiki/Typographical_error \"Typographical error\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Characteristics\n  * 2 Geography\n    * 2.1 The Land of Oz\n    * 2.2 West and East\n    * 2.3 Location\n    * 2.4 Inspiration\n    * 2.5 Witches and wizards\n    * 2.6 Animals\n    * 2.7 Other races\n  * 3 History\n    * 3.1 Prehistory\n    * 3.2 History through the first six books\n  * 4 Economy and politics\n  * 5 Defense\n  * 6 Characters\n  * 7 Other media\n    * 7.1 The 1939 MGM film's Oz\n    * 7.2 Gregory Maguire's revisionist Oz\n    * 7.3 Alexander Melentyevich Volkov's Magic Land\n    * 7.4 March Laumer's Oz\n    * 7.5 Philip José Farmer's Oz\n    * 7.6 Robert A.

In\nthe center of Oz, where the diagonals cross, is the fabled [Emerald\nCity](/wiki/Emerald_City \"Emerald City\"), capital of the land of Oz and seat\nto the monarch of Oz, [Princess Ozma](/wiki/Princess_Ozma \"Princess Ozma\").[7]\n\nThe regions have a color schema: blue for Munchkins, yellow for Winkies, red\nfor Quadlings, green for the Emerald city, and (in works after the first)\npurple for the Gillikins, which region was also not named in the first\nbook.[8] (This contrasts with Kansas; Baum, describing it, used \"gray\" nine\ntimes in four paragraphs.[9]) In _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ , this is merely\nthe [favorite color](/wiki/Favorite_color \"Favorite color\"), used for clothing\nand other man-made objects, and having some influence on their choice of\ncrops, but the basic colors of the world are natural colors.[8] The effect is\nless consistent in later works. In _[The Marvelous Land of\nOz](/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\")_ , the book\nstates that everything in the land of the Gillikins is purple, including the\nplants and mud, and a character can see that he is leaving when the grass\nturns from purple to green, but it also describes pumpkins as orange and corn\nas green in that land.[10] Baum, indeed, never used the color schema\nconsistently; in many books, he alluded to the colors to orient the characters\nand readers to their location, and then did not refer to it again.[11] His\nmost common technique was to depict the man-made articles and flowers as the\ncolor of the country, leaving leaves, grass, and fruit their natural\ncolors.[12]\n\nMost of these regions are settled with prosperous and contented people.\nHowever, this naturally is lacking in scope for plot. Numerous pockets\nthroughout the land of Oz are cut off from the main culture, for geographic or\ncultural reasons. Many have never heard of Ozma, making it impossible for them\nto acknowledge her as their rightful queen. These regions are concentrated\naround the edges of the country, and constitute the main settings for books\nthat are set entirely within Oz.[13] _[The Lost Princess of\nOz](/wiki/The_Lost_Princess_of_Oz \"The Lost Princess of Oz\")_ , for instance\nis set entirely in rough country in Winkie Country, between two settled\nareas.[14] In _[Glinda of Oz](/wiki/Glinda_of_Oz \"Glinda of Oz\")_ , Ozma\nspeaks of her duty to discover all these stray corners of Oz.[15]\n\nIn _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ , a [yellow brick\nroad](/wiki/Yellow_brick_road \"Yellow brick road\") leads from the lands of the\nMunchkins to the Emerald City. Other such roads featured in other works: one\nfrom Gillikin Country in _The Marvelous Land of Oz_ , and a second one from\nMunchkin Land in _The Patchwork Girl of Oz_.[16]\n\nOz is completely surrounded on all four sides by a desert which insulates the\ncitizens of the Land of Oz from discovery and invasion. In the first two\nbooks, this is merely a natural desert, with only its extent making it\ndangerous to the traveler, but in _The Road to Oz_ it is said to turn anyone\nwho touches it to sand.[17] Indeed, in _The Marvelous Land of Oz_ , Mombi\ntries to escape through it and Glinda chases her over the sands. Still, it is\nthe dividing land between the magic of Oz and the outside world, and the\n[Winged Monkeys](/wiki/Winged_monkeys \"Winged monkeys\") can not obey Dorothy's\ncommand to carry her home because it would take them outside the lands of\nOz.[18] In _[Ozma of Oz](/wiki/Ozma_of_Oz \"Ozma of Oz\")_ , it has become a\nmagical desert called the [Deadly Desert](/wiki/Deadly_Desert \"Deadly Desert\")\nwith life-destroying sands and noxious fumes, a feature that remained constant\nthrough the rest of the series, although no actual destruction is depicted in\nthe Oz books, unlike in the film _[Return to Oz](/wiki/Return_to_Oz \"Return to\nOz\")_.[19] The desert has nonetheless been breached numerous times, both by\nchildren from our world (mostly harmless), by the Wizard of Oz himself, and by\nmore sinister characters, such as the [Nome King](/wiki/Nome_King \"Nome\nKing\"), who attempted to conquer Oz. After such an attempt in _[The Emerald\nCity of Oz](/wiki/The_Emerald_City_of_Oz \"The Emerald City of Oz\")_ , the book\nends with [Glinda](/wiki/Glinda \"Glinda\") creating a barrier of invisibility\naround the Land of Oz, for further protection.[20] This was, indeed, an\nearnest effort on Baum's part to end the series, but the insistence of readers\nmeant the continuation of the series, and therefore the discovery of many ways\nfor people to pass through this barrier as well as over the sands.[3] Despite\nthis continual evasion, the barrier itself remained; nowhere in any Oz book\ndid Baum hint that the inhabitants were even considering removing the magical\nbarrier.[15]\n\n### West and East[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: West and East\")]\n\nThe first known map of Oz was a glass slide used in Baum's _Fairylogue and\nRadio-Play_ traveling show, showing the blue land of the Munchkins in the east\nand the yellow land of the Winkies in the west. These directions are confirmed\nby the text of all of Baum's Oz books, especially the first, in which the\n[Wicked Witch of the East](/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_East \"Wicked Witch of the\nEast\") rules over the [Munchkins](/wiki/Munchkin \"Munchkin\"), and the [Wicked\nWitch of the West](/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_West \"Wicked Witch of the West\")\nrules over the [Winkies](/wiki/Winkie_Country \"Winkie Country\").\n\nLike traditional western maps, the _Fairylogue and Radio-Play_ map showed the\nwest on the left, and the east on the right. However, the first map of Oz to\nappear in an Oz book had those directions reversed, and the [compass\nrose](/wiki/Compass_rose \"Compass rose\") adjusted accordingly.[21] It is\nbelieved that this is a result of Baum copying the map from the wrong side of\nthe glass slide, effectively getting a mirror image of his intended map. When\nhe realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the compass rose to\nmake the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the\ncompass rose, thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further\nconfusion.[22] Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who\nfrequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result.\n\nAnother speculation stems from the original conception of Oz, which at first\nappeared to be situated in an American desert. If Baum thought of the country\nof the Munchkins as the nearest region to him, it would have been in the east\nwhile he lived in Chicago, but when he moved to California, it would have been\nin the west.[23]\n\nModern maps of Oz are almost universally drawn with the Winkies in the west\nand the Munchkins in the east, although west and east often appear reversed.\nMany Oz fans believe this is the correct orientation, perhaps as a result of\nGlinda's spell, which has the effect of confusing most standard compasses;\nperhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found [through the\nlooking glass](/wiki/Through_the_looking_glass \"Through the looking glass\") in\nwhich everything was a mirror image; or perhaps just reflecting the alien\nnature of Oz. In [Robert A. Heinlein](/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein \"Robert A.\nHeinlein\")'s book _[The Number of the\nBeast](/wiki/The_Number_of_the_Beast_\\(novel\\) \"The Number of the Beast\n\\(novel\\)\")_ he posits that Oz is on a\n[retrograde](/wiki/Retrograde_and_direct_motion \"Retrograde and direct\nmotion\") planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so\nthat the sun seems to rise on one's left as one faces north. [March\nLaumer](/wiki/March_Laumer \"March Laumer\")'s _The Magic Mirror of Oz_\nattributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to\nturn the Land of Oz orange.\n\n### Location[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Location\")]\n\nOz, like all of Baum's fantasy countries, was presented as existing as part of\nthe real world, albeit protected from civilization by natural barriers.[24]\nIndeed, in the first books, nothing indicated that it was not hidden in the\ndeserts of the United States.[7] It gradually acquired neighboring magical\ncountries, often from works of Baum's that had been independent, as\n[Ix](/wiki/Ix_\\(Oz\\) \"Ix \\(Oz\\)\") from _[Queen Zixi of\nIx](/wiki/Queen_Zixi_of_Ix \"Queen Zixi of Ix\")_ , and [Mo](/wiki/Mo_\\(Oz\\) \"Mo\n\\(Oz\\)\") from _[The Magical Monarch of Mo](/wiki/The_Magical_Monarch_of_Mo\n\"The Magical Monarch of Mo\")_.[25] The first of these is [Ev](/wiki/Land_of_Ev\n\"Land of Ev\"), introduced in _[Ozma of Oz](/wiki/Ozma_of_Oz \"Ozma of\nOz\")_.[19]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Oz-and-surrounding-\ncountrie.jpg/400px-Oz-and-surrounding-countrie.jpg)](/wiki/File:Oz-and-\nsurrounding-countrie.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Oz-and-surrounding-countrie.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOz and surrounding countries, on the map from _[Tik-Tok of Oz](/wiki/Tik-\nTok_of_Oz \"Tik-Tok of Oz\")_ (The directional indicator in the map's corner\nshows North and South correctly, but it flips East to the left, and West to\nthe right).\n\nIn _[Tik-Tok of Oz](/wiki/Tik-Tok_of_Oz \"Tik-Tok of Oz\")_ , Baum included maps\nin the endpapers which definitively situated Oz on a continent with its\nneighboring countries.[26] Oz is the largest country on the continent\nunofficially known as [Nonestica](/wiki/Nonestica \"Nonestica\") (this name was\nproposed by Robert R. Pattrick for the whole of the countries surrounding Oz;\nPattrick proposed \"Ozeria\" for the whole continent,[27] but that name is\ngenerally unused in fan discussions), which also includes the countries of Ev,\nIx, and Mo, which has also been known as Phunniland, among others. Nonestica\nis, according to the map, in the [Nonestic Ocean](/wiki/Nonestic_Ocean\n\"Nonestic Ocean\"). A fair amount of evidence in the books point to this\ncontinent as being envisioned as somewhere in the southern [Pacific\nOcean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean \"Pacific Ocean\").[28] At the opening of _[Ozma of\nOz](/wiki/Ozma_of_Oz \"Ozma of Oz\"),_ [Dorothy Gale](/wiki/Dorothy_Gale\n\"Dorothy Gale\") is sailing to [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") with\nher [Uncle Henry](/wiki/Uncle_Henry_\\(Oz\\) \"Uncle Henry \\(Oz\\)\") when she is\nwashed overboard (in a chicken coop, with [Billina](/wiki/Billina \"Billina\")\nthe yellow hen), and lands on the shore of Ev—a rare instance in which an\noutsider reaches the Oz landmass through non-magical (or _apparently_ non-\nmagical) means. Palm trees grow outside the Royal Palace in the Emerald City,\nand horses are not native to Oz, both points of consistency with a South-\nPacific location; illustrations and descriptions of round-shaped and domed\nOzite houses suggest a non-Western architecture. Conversely, Oz has\ntechnological, architectural, and urban elements typical of Europe and North\nAmerica around the turn of the twentieth century; but this may involve\ncultural input from unusual external sources (see History below). Ruth Plumly\nThompson asserts in her first Oz book, _[The Royal Book of\nOz](/wiki/The_Royal_Book_of_Oz \"The Royal Book of Oz\")_ , that the language of\nOz is English, which also suggests European or American influence.\n\nAn argument against the South Pacific is that the seasons in Oz are shown as\nthe same seasons in the United States at the same time. In addition, in _[The\nWishing Horse of Oz](/wiki/The_Wishing_Horse_of_Oz \"The Wishing Horse of Oz\")_\n, [Pigasus](/wiki/Pigasus_\\(literature\\) \"Pigasus \\(literature\\)\") follows the\n[North Star](/wiki/North_Star \"North Star\") when he flies to Thunder Mountain,\nwhich could only be done in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n### Inspiration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Inspiration\")]\n\nBaum's creation of the Emerald City may have been inspired by the White City\nof the [World Columbian Exposition](/wiki/World_Columbian_Exposition \"World\nColumbian Exposition\"), which he visited frequently. Its quick building, in\nless than a year, may have been an element in the quick construction of the\nEmerald City in the first book.[29]\n\nSchematically, Oz is much like the United States, with the Emerald City taking\nthe place of Chicago: to the East, mixed forest and farmland; to the West,\ntreeless plains and fields of wheat; to the South, warmth and lush growth, and\nred earth.[29]\n\nRuth Plumly Thompson took a different direction with her Oz books, introducing\nEuropean elements such as the title character of _[The Yellow Knight of\nOz](/wiki/The_Yellow_Knight_of_Oz \"The Yellow Knight of Oz\")_ , a knight\nstraight out of [Arthurian Legend](/wiki/Arthurian_Legend \"Arthurian Legend\").\n\n### Witches and\nwizards[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Witches and wizards\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Wicked_Witch2.jpg/250px-\nWicked_Witch2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Wicked_Witch2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Wicked_Witch2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Wicked Witch of the West](/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_West \"Wicked Witch of\nthe West\") melts, from the [William Wallace\nDenslow](/wiki/William_Wallace_Denslow \"William Wallace Denslow\") illustration\nin the first edition of _[The Wonderful Wizard of\nOz](/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\")_ (1900)\n\nAt the time of _[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz](/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz\n\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\")_ , the lands in the North, South, East and West\nof Oz are each ruled by a [Witch](/wiki/Witchcraft \"Witchcraft\"). The Witches\nof the North and South are good, while the Witches of the East and West are\nwicked. [Glinda](/wiki/Glinda_the_Good_Witch \"Glinda the Good Witch\") (the\nGood Witch of the South) is later revealed to be the most powerful of the\nfour, although later Oz books reveal that the [Wicked Witch of the\nWest](/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_West \"Wicked Witch of the West\") was so\npowerful, even Glinda feared her. After Dorothy's house crushes the [Wicked\nWitch of the East](/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_East \"Wicked Witch of the East\"),\nthereby liberating the Munchkins from bondage, the [Good Witch of the\nNorth](/wiki/Good_Witch_of_the_North \"Good Witch of the North\") tells Dorothy\nthat she (the Witch of the North) is not as powerful as the Wicked Witch of\nthe East had been, or she would have freed the Munchkins herself.\n\nDuring the first scene in Oz in _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ , the Good Witch\nof the North (Locasta or Tattypoo) explains to Dorothy that Oz still has\nwitches and wizards, not being civilized, and goes on to explain that witches\nand wizards can be both good and evil, unlike the evil witches that Dorothy\nhad been told of.[30] That book contained only the four witches (besides the\nhumbug wizard), but despite Ozma's prohibition on magic, many more magicians\nfeature in later works.\n\nBaum tended to capitalize the word \"Witch\" when referring to the Witches of\nthe North, South, East or West, but did not do so when referring to witches in\ngeneral. For example, in the aforementioned first scene of _The Wonderful\nWizard of Oz_ , Locasta (or Tattypoo) thanks Dorothy for killing the \"Wicked\nWitch of the East\", and introduces herself as \"the Witch of the North\", with\nthe word \"Witch\" capitalized in both cases. However, when she goes on to tell\nDorothy that \"I [the Witch of the North] am a good witch, and the people love\nme\", the word \"witch\" is not capitalized.\n\nWhite is the traditional color of witches in Oz. The Good Witch of the North\nwears a pointed white hat and a white gown decorated with stars, while Glinda,\nthe Good Witch of the South (called a \"sorceress\" in later books), wears a\npure white dress. Dorothy is taken for a witch not only because she had killed\nthe Wicked Witch of the East, but because her dress is blue and white\nchecked.[31]\n\nOzma, once on the throne, prohibits the use of magic by anyone other than\n[Glinda](/wiki/Glinda \"Glinda\") the Good, the [Wizard of\nOz](/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_\\(character\\) \"Wizard of Oz \\(character\\)\"), and\nherself – as, earlier, the Good Witch of the North had prohibited magic by any\nother witch in her domains.[32] The illicit use of magic is a frequent feature\nof villains in later works in the series, appearing in _[The Scarecrow of\nOz](/wiki/The_Scarecrow_of_Oz \"The Scarecrow of Oz\")_ , _[Rinkitink in\nOz](/wiki/Rinkitink_in_Oz \"Rinkitink in Oz\")_ , _[The Lost Princess of\nOz](/wiki/The_Lost_Princess_of_Oz \"The Lost Princess of Oz\")_ , _[The Tin\nWoodman of Oz](/wiki/The_Tin_Woodman_of_Oz \"The Tin Woodman of Oz\")_ , and\n_[The Magic of Oz](/wiki/The_Magic_of_Oz \"The Magic of Oz\")_.[33]\n\n### Animals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Animals\")]\n\nThere are different kinds of animals living in Oz. According to Baum, all\nanimals in Oz have the ability to speak because it is a \"fairy\" kingdom. When\nasked by his readers why Dorothy's dog [Toto](/wiki/Toto_\\(Oz\\) \"Toto \\(Oz\\)\")\ndid not speak, Baum insisted that he had the ability to, but did not choose to\nspeak, but he finally does so in _[Tik-Tok of Oz](/wiki/Tik-Tok_of_Oz \"Tik-Tok\nof Oz\")_.\n\nAmong the many animals in Oz are:\n\n  * **A-B-Sea Serpent** – A 200 feet (61 m) long sea serpent that is composed of alphabet blocks.\n  * **Chiss** – An evil [porcupine](/wiki/Porcupine \"Porcupine\") spirit that can launch his quills.\n  * **Choggenmugger** \\- Thick, hard scales cover its body.

Among the known races are:\n\n  * **The Bun People of Bunbury** – The Bun People are made of baked goods.\n  * **The[Bunnies](/wiki/Rabbit \"Rabbit\") of Bunnybury** – A race of civilized rabbits.\n  * **The[China](/wiki/Chinese_ceramics \"Chinese ceramics\") People** – A race of beings that are made of china (porcelain) that live in Quadling Country.\n  * **The Cuttenclips** – A race of living paper dolls that live in Quadling Country.\n  * **The Dicks** – The topsy-turvy inhabitants of Dicksy Land.\n  * **The Equinots** – A race of [centaurs](/wiki/Centaur \"Centaur\").\n  * **The Flatheads** – A race of flat-headed humans who carry their brains in cans.\n  * **The Flutterbudgets** – A race of people who entertain foolish fears and spend time worrying over nothing.\n  * **The Fuddles** – A race of anthropomorphic [jigsaw puzzles](/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle \"Jigsaw puzzle\") that live in Fuddlecumjig.\n  * **The Hammerheads** – An armless race with extensible necks and hard heads.\n  * **The Hoopers** – A race of 10 ft. tall humanoids that live in the Purple Forest of Gillikin Country and can roll into hoops by grabbing their toes with their hands.\n  * **The Hoppers** – A race of one-legged people that live inside a mountain in Quadling Country.\n  * **The Horners** – A race of strange one-horned people that live inside a mountain in Quadling Country.\n  * **The Hyups** – A subspecies of Munchkins that live on Mount Munch.\n  * **The Loons** – A race of living balloon people that live in Loonville.\n  * **The Magical Mimics** – A race of evil shape-shifting creatures that are a type of Erb that live on Mount Illuso.\n  * **The Phanfasms** – A magically powerful race of Erb spirits that change their appearance into beasts.\n  * **The Rigmaroles** – A race of people that make long deliberate speeches which makes use of many words.\n  * **The Scares** – A race of grotesque beings that reside in Scare City within Quadling Country.\n  * **The Scooters** – A race of people that live on the waters of the Gillikin River.

Despite the overlordship of Ozma, many of the communities\nlive autonomously. Oz has great tolerance for eccentricity and oddness.[34]\n\nMany characters in Oz are animated objects. Such figures as the Glass Cat, the\n[Scarecrow](/wiki/Scarecrow_\\(Oz\\) \"Scarecrow \\(Oz\\)\"), [Jack\nPumpkinhead](/wiki/Jack_Pumpkinhead \"Jack Pumpkinhead\"), the\n[Sawhorse](/wiki/Sawhorse_\\(Oz\\) \"Sawhorse \\(Oz\\)\"), and others are common.[7]\nEntire regions are the homes of such animated beings. The Dainty China Country\nis entirely filled with creatures made of china, who would freeze into\nfigurines if removed. The China princess lives in fear of breaking, because\nshe would never be as pretty even if repaired.[35]\n\nMany other characters are highly individual, even unique members of a species.\nMany such people from the outer worlds find refuge in Oz, which is highly\ntolerant of eccentricity.[36]\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n### Prehistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Prehistory\")]\n\nThe history of Oz prior to _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ (often called the\nprehistory of Oz as it takes place before Baum's \"histories\") is often the\nsubject of dispute, as Baum himself gave conflicting accounts. In _The\nWonderful Wizard of Oz_ , the title character recounts that he was a\nventriloquist and a circus balloonist from [Omaha](/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska\n\"Omaha, Nebraska\"), and during one flight the rope for his [parachute\nvent](/wiki/Hot_air_balloons#Vents \"Hot air balloons\") became tangled,\npreventing him from descending until the next morning, and he awoke to find\nthat he was floating over a strange land. When he landed, the people thought\nhe was a great wizard because of his ability to fly. He did not disabuse them\nof this notion, and with his new power over them, he had them build a city\nwith a palace in the center of Oz. He also ordered them to wear green glasses\nso it would appear to be made entirely of emeralds.[29] However, in the later\nOz books the city is depicted as actually being made of emerald or other green\nmaterials.[11] The Wizard was a young man when he first arrived in Oz, and\ngrew old while he was there.[37] Afraid of the Wicked Witches of the West and\nthe East, who, unlike him, could do real magic, the Wizard hid away in a room\nof his palace and refused to see visitors. He lived in this way until the\narrival of Dorothy in the first book.\n\nIn _[The Marvelous Land of Oz](/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz \"The Marvelous\nLand of Oz\")_ the prehistory was changed slightly. Glinda, the Good Witch of\nthe South, reveals that the Wizard usurped the previous king of Oz\n[Pastoria](/wiki/Pastoria \"Pastoria\") and hid away his daughter Ozma. This was\nBaum's reaction to the popular 1903 Broadway extravaganza Baum adapted from\nhis book, _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ , in which the Wizard took the role of\nthe main antagonist and the Wicked Witch of the West was left out.[38]\n\nThe Wizard, however, had been more popular with his readers than he thought.\nIn _[Ozma of Oz](/wiki/Ozma_of_Oz \"Ozma of Oz\")_ , he omitted any mention of\nthe Wizard's having usurped the throne of Ozma's father,[39] but the largest\nchanges occurred in the next book.\n\nIn the preface to _[Dorothy and the Wizard in\nOz](/wiki/Dorothy_and_the_Wizard_in_Oz \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\")_ , Baum\nremarks that the Wizard had turned out to be a popular character with the\nchildren who had read the first book and so he brought the Wizard back. During\nit, the Wizard relates yet another account of his history in Oz, telling Ozma\nthat his birth name was Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle Emmanuel\nAmbroise Diggs, which, being a very long and cumbersome name, and as his other\ninitials spelled out \"PINHEAD,\" he preferred to leave just as O.Z. The balloon\npart of his story was unchanged, except for the detail added by Ozma, that the\npeople probably saw his initials on his balloon and took them as a message\nthat he was to be their king. She relates that the country was already named\nOz (a word which in their language means \"great and good\"), and that it was\ntypical for the rulers to have names that are variations of Oz (King Pastoria\nbeing a notable exception to this rule).\n\nOzma elaborates further, saying that there were once four Wicked Witches in\nOz, who leagued together to depose the King, but the Wicked Witches of the\nNorth and South were defeated by Good Witches before the Wizard arrived in Oz.\nAccording to this version, the King at the time was Ozma's grandfather. This\nversion of prehistory restores the Wizard's reputation,[37] but adds the\nawkwardness of both Ozma and her father having been born in captivity.\n\nIn _[The Tin Woodman of Oz](/wiki/The_Tin_Woodman_of_Oz \"The Tin Woodman of\nOz\")_ Baum writes how Oz came to be a fairyland:\n\n    _Oz was not always a fairyland, I am told. Once it was much like other lands, except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it, thus preventing its people from all contact with the rest of the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of[Queen Lurline](/wiki/Queen_Lurline \"Queen Lurline\"), passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about it._\n\nThenceforward, no one in Oz would ever age, get sick, or die. After becoming a\nfairyland, Oz harbored many Witches, Magicians, and Sorcerers until the time\nwhen Ozma made magic illegal without a permit. In yet another inconsistency,\nit is implied that Ozma was the fairy left behind by Queen Lurline to rule the\ncountry, contradicting the story where she was Pastoria's daughter. This is\nlater confirmed in _[Glinda of Oz](/wiki/Glinda_of_Oz \"Glinda of Oz\")_ :\n\n    _\" If you are really Princess Ozma of Oz,\" the Flathead said, \"you are one of that band of fairies who, under Queen Lurline, made all Oz a Fairyland. I have heard that Lurline left one of her own fairies to rule Oz, and gave the fairy the name of Ozma.\"_\n\nWhile this explains why no one dies or ages, and nevertheless there are people\nof differing ages in Oz, it is completely inconsistent with the earlier\nversions of the prehistory.[40]\n\nMaguire, author of\n_[Wicked](/wiki/Wicked:_The_Life_and_Times_of_the_Wicked_Witch_of_the_West\n\"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\")_ addresses this\ninconsistency by saying that the people of Oz believe that Ozma is\nreincarnated—that her spirit was left behind by Lurline, but her body is\nreborn to different mortal queens.\n\nIn [Jack Snow](/wiki/Jack_Snow_\\(writer\\) \"Jack Snow \\(writer\\)\")'s _[The\nMagical Mimics in Oz](/wiki/The_Magical_Mimics_in_Oz \"The Magical Mimics in\nOz\")_ , the prehistory story is retold. This version relates that Ozma was\ngiven to the king of Oz as an adoptive daughter, for he was old and had no\nchildren.\n\nIn the Magic Land stories of Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the prehistory is\nquite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000 years ago by a wizard named\nHurricap, who was tired of people coming to him with requests, so he decided\nto find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and\nseparated it from the rest of the world, along with putting the enchantments\nof eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov's version doesn't include any\nforms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already\ncontained people (since he was a giant, already suffering from nearsightedness\nin his advanced age, and the people in the Magic Land were much shorter than\nin other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the\nenchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away\nfrom his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by\na sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an\nenchanted sleep for 5,000 years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth\nbook in Volkov's series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to\noverthrow his father about 1,000 years ago (He and his accomplices were\nbanished to an underground cave and became the Magic Land's main source of\nmetal and gems, an analogue to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches\n(which only occurred about 500 years ago in this continuity).\n\n### History through the first six\nbooks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: History through the first six books\")]\n\nEventually, Dorothy Gale and her whole house are blown into Oz from\n[Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\") by a tornado. When the house lands, it crushes\nthe [Wicked Witch of the East](/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_East \"Wicked Witch of\nthe East\") (in Gregory Maguire's book, _[Wicked: The Life and Times of the\nWicked Witch of the\nWest](/wiki/Wicked:_The_Life_and_Times_of_the_Wicked_Witch_of_the_West\n\"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\")_ , she is given\na name, Nessarose), ruler of the [Munchkins](/wiki/Munchkins \"Munchkins\"). In\nan attempt to get back to her home, she journeys to the Emerald City. Along\nthe way, she meets the [Tin Woodman](/wiki/Tin_Woodman \"Tin Woodman\"), the\n[Cowardly Lion](/wiki/Cowardly_Lion \"Cowardly Lion\"), and the\n[Scarecrow](/wiki/Scarecrow_\\(Oz\\) \"Scarecrow \\(Oz\\)\"), all of whom accompany\nher. Once there, they become the first people to gain an audience with the\nWizard since he went into seclusion, although he disguises himself because\nDorothy now has the Wicked Witch of the East's magic silver slippers, and he\nis afraid of her. The Wizard sends Dorothy and her party to destroy the\n[Wicked Witch of the West](/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_West \"Wicked Witch of the\nWest\") and in exchange promises to grant her request to be sent home.\nSurprisingly, Dorothy \"destroys\" the Witch by throwing a pail of water on her,\ncausing her to melt. Defeated, the Wizard reveals to the group that he is in\nfact not a real wizard and has no magical powers, but he promises to grant\nDorothy's wish and take her home himself in his balloon. He leaves the\nScarecrow in his place to rule Oz.\n\nFinally, it is discovered that the wizard had given the daughter of the last\nking of Oz, Princess Ozma, to the old witch [Mombi](/wiki/Mombi \"Mombi\") to\nhave her hidden away. Mombi had turned Ozma into a boy named Tip, whom she\nraised. When all of this is revealed Tip is turned back into Ozma and takes\nher rightful place as the benevolent ruler of all of Oz. Ozma successfully\nwards off several attempts by various armies to overthrow her. To prevent any\nupheaval of her rule over Oz, she outlaws the practice of all magic in Oz\nexcept by herself, the returned and reformed wizard, and by Glinda, and she\nhas Glinda make all of Oz invisible to outsiders. Ozma remains the ruler of Oz\nfor the entire series.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Royal_Oz_flag.svg/220px-\nRoyal_Oz_flag.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Royal_Oz_flag.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Royal_Oz_flag.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Royal flag of Oz, as described in _[Dorothy and the Wizard in\nOz](/wiki/Dorothy_and_the_Wizard_in_Oz \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\")_\n\n## Economy and\npolitics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Economy and politics\")]\n\nSome political analysts have claimed that Oz is a thinly disguised\n[socialist](/wiki/Socialism \"Socialism\") [utopia](/wiki/Utopia \"Utopia\"),\nthough some Baum scholars disagree.[41] Advocates of this theory support it\nusing this quotation from _[The Emerald City of\nOz](/wiki/The_Emerald_City_of_Oz \"The Emerald City of Oz\")_ :\n\n    There were no poor people in the land of Oz, because there was no such thing as money, and all property of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.\n\nThis is a revision of the original society: in the first two books, the people\nof Oz lived in a money-based economy.[5] For instance, the people of the\nEmerald City use \"green pennies\" as coinage.[42] Money was not abolished in\nthe course of the series, but excised from the conception of Oz.[43] Indeed,\nin _[The Magic of Oz](/wiki/The_Magic_of_Oz \"The Magic of Oz\")_ , a character\nfrom Oz gets into trouble when he goes to Ev because he was unaware of the\nconcept of money.[44] This decision to remove money from Oz may reflect Baum's\nown financial difficulties in the times when he was writing these books.[42]\n\nSince Oz is ruled by a [monarch](/wiki/Monarch \"Monarch\"), benevolent though\nshe may be, Oz is closer in nature to an [absolute\nmonarchy](/wiki/Absolute_monarchy \"Absolute monarchy\") than a communist or\nMarxist state.[45] When she was first introduced, Ozma was the monarch\nspecifically of the Emerald City, but in the description of _Ozma of Oz_ , Oz\nis presented as a federal state, rather like the [German\nEmpire](/wiki/German_Empire \"German Empire\"), in monarchies rather than\nrepublics: having an [overall ruler](/wiki/Emperor \"Emperor\") in Ozma, and\nindividual kings and queens of smaller portions.[46]\n\nThe society grew steadily more utopian, in that its peace and prosperity were\norganized, but from the first book, it was a stupendously wealthy country, in\ncontrast to Kansas's crop failures, droughts, and mortgages—just as it also is\ncolorful to contrast with Kansas's gray.[47] On the other hand, despite the\npresence of the Emerald City, Oz is an agrarian country, similar to Kansas;\nthe story has been interpreted as a [populist](/wiki/Populism \"Populism\")\nparable, and certainly contains many populist themes.[48]\n\nIn _[The Wonder City of Oz](/wiki/The_Wonder_City_of_Oz \"The Wonder City of\nOz\")_ , Princess Ozma (called \"Queen Ozma\" in this book) is seen running for\nelection (\"ozlection\") to her office as ruler against [Jenny\nJump](/wiki/List_of_Oz_characters#Jenny_Jump \"List of Oz characters\"), a half-\nfairy newcomer from [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey \"New Jersey\"). However, this\nbook was not written by Baum, but by John R. Neill, Baum's second successor.\nFurther, the concept of the \"ozlection\" was not in Neill's manuscript for the\nbook, but was added by an editor at Reilly and Lee, the publisher.\n\nAt times the rulers of Oz's territories have grander titles than would\nnormally be customary, but this is done mostly for the satisfaction of the\nincumbents. The ruler of the Winkie Country is the Emperor, the Tin Woodman.\nThe ruler of the [Quadling Country](/wiki/Quadling_Country \"Quadling Country\")\nis Glinda the Good. The Munchkin Country is ruled by a king, later identified\nas Cheeriobed, who is revealed to be married to the Good Witch of the North,\nwho, a spell broken, abdicates leadership of the Gillikin Country to Joe King\nand Queen Hyacinth of Up Town.[49]\n\nThe Royal Flag of Oz is based on the map of the Land of Oz; the four colors\nrepresent the four countries, and the green star represents the Emerald City.\n\n## Defense[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Defense\")]\n\nOz is mostly a peaceful land and the idea of subversion is largely unknown to\nits people. Most military positions are only formal. This has caused many\nproblems, such as in _[The Marvelous Land of\nOz](/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\")_ when the\nEmerald City (which was only guarded by an elderly doorman and one soldier who\nwas the entire Army of Oz at the time) was easily conquered by the Army of\nRevolt led by [General Jinjur](/wiki/Jinjur \"Jinjur\"). This army was in turn\noverwhelmed by another army of girls led by Glinda.\n\nSecurity of Oz is mostly maintained by magic such as Glinda's spell making Oz\ncompletely invisible. Oz also has a natural barrier in the form of a desert\nthat surrounds the land: anyone who touches the desert turns to sand. The\n[Nome King](/wiki/Nome_King \"Nome King\") has tried to conquer Oz on several\noccasions. A nominal army once existed, but it had an extremely large\nofficers/privates ratio; other than its commander the Tin Woodman and one\nprivate, the portion of it seen in _Ozma of Oz_ was composed entirely of\ncowardly officers. In the end of the book it was said that there are three\nprivates all in all, and it is unknown how many—if any—officers were left at\nhome during Ozma's travel to Ev. The private seen in the book, named [Omby\nAmby](/wiki/Omby_Amby \"Omby Amby\"), is later promoted to Captain General.\n\nIn the book _Emerald City of Oz_ , there are 2 towns called Rigmarole Town and\nFlutterbudgets that are the defensive settlements of Oz.\n\nIn the movie _[Return to Oz](/wiki/Return_to_Oz \"Return to Oz\"),_ the\nmechanical man [Tik-Tok](/wiki/Tik-Tok_\\(Oz\\) \"Tik-Tok \\(Oz\\)\") is the entire\nRoyal Army of Oz.\n\nAttempts by outsiders to conquer the Land of Oz are frequent, particularly in\nthe Oz books by Ruth Plumly Thompson. But these attempts are always\nsuccessfully thwarted in the end, usually by Ozma or by forces sympathetic to\nher.\n\n## Characters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Characters\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Oz characters](/wiki/List_of_Oz_characters \"List of Oz\ncharacters\")\n\nRecurring characters in the classic Oz series include:\n\n  * **[Dorothy Gale](/wiki/Dorothy_Gale \"Dorothy Gale\")** – A heroic little orphan girl from [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\"). In later Oz books, she eventually moves to Oz permanently after visiting the land several times and having several adventures there.

The most notable\ndifference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up\nby [Dorothy Gale](/wiki/Dorothy_Gale \"Dorothy Gale\") (thus making it a [dream\nworld](/wiki/Dream_world_\\(plot_device\\) \"Dream world \\(plot device\\)\")),\nalthough, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed\nthere, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is\npresented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one's home, no\nmatter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for\nhaving a home and a family is not something that should be taken for granted.\nThis contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are\neventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm,\nshowing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the\nprairies of [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\").\n\nThere are many other small differences between the books and the movie. For\nexample, when Dorothy arrives in [Munchkinland](/wiki/Munchkin_Country\n\"Munchkin Country\") the [Munchkins](/wiki/Munchkins \"Munchkins\") are seen\nwearing colorful costumes, but in the book Munchkins are said to only wear\nblue as blue is the official dominant color of the east. The first witch\nDorothy meets in Oz in the book is the [Good Witch of the\nNorth](/wiki/Good_Witch_of_the_North \"Good Witch of the North\"), a minor\ncharacter that only had one other appearance in Baum's books but is an\nimportant figure of Oz nonetheless. In the movie this character is conflated\nwith that of [Glinda](/wiki/Glinda \"Glinda\"), who is the Good Witch of the\nSouth and does not make an appearance until the very end of Baum's story. The\ncharacter of Glinda in the books dresses in all white silk, as white is the\ntraditional color for good witches, whereas in the film she is seen in pink.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that the Dorothy of the books is only a little girl\nwho is no older than twelve-years-old. However, she is mature and very\nresourceful, only crying when faced with ultimate despair, whereas the older\nDorothy of the movie (portrayed as a twelve-year-old by sixteen-year-old [Judy\nGarland](/wiki/Judy_Garland \"Judy Garland\")) spends several portions of the\nfilm crying and being told by others what to do, however her fear was\novershadowed by the Cowardly Lion's. This is more consistent with Thompson's\nportrayal of Dorothy—Baum is known for his strong and independent female\ncharacters.[50]\n\n[The Wicked Witch of the West](/wiki/The_Wicked_Witch_of_the_West \"The Wicked\nWitch of the West\") also changes significantly between books and movie. In the\nbooks no mention is ever made of her skin color, whereas in the movie she is\ngreen without explanation, although the [Winkies](/wiki/Winkie_Country \"Winkie\nCountry\") she has enslaved and turned into soldiers are also green. In the\nbook it is implied but not stated that she dresses in yellow, as yellow is the\nofficial dominant color of the [Winkie Country](/wiki/Winkie_Country \"Winkie\nCountry\") where she rules, whereas in the movie she dresses entirely in black.\nIn the book she is portrayed as having only one eye, which is so powerful it\ncould see distant objects like a telescope, but in the movie she uses a\ncrystal ball to watch Dorothy and her friends from afar. The 1939 MGM film\nmakes the first reference to The Witches of the East and West being sisters,\nwhich was not the case in the book; none of the Witches in Baum's Oz are\nrelated.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz does not resort to anywhere near as much trickery in the\nmovie as the book. In the book he entertains each member of Dorothy's party on\na different day, and takes a different form for each; appearing as a giant\ngreen head, a beautiful fairy, a great beast, and a levitating ball of fire.\nIn the movie he takes only one of these forms—that of the giant green head.\n\nThe nature of the [Emerald City](/wiki/Emerald_City \"Emerald City\") is changed\nin the film. In the book, the city is not actually all green, but everyone is\nforced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from\nthe glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear\ngreen. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the\nEmerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than\nBaum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in\nglittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie there is\nonly a gate opening.\n\nThe movie replaces the charmed [Silver Shoes with pointed\ntoes](/wiki/Silver_Shoes \"Silver Shoes\") of the book with [Ruby-Red\nSlippers](/wiki/Ruby_Slippers \"Ruby Slippers\"). This was because full color\nmotion pictures were still a relatively new technology in 1939, and MGM wanted\nto show off the visually dazzling process. Shiny red shoes were more\nimpressive in a color motion picture compared to silver ones.[51] Due to the\npopularity of the movie, the green witch and the Ruby Slippers are more well\nknown to the general public and pop culture than their book counterparts, and\nare even considered iconic.\n\n### Gregory Maguire's revisionist\nOz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section:\nGregory Maguire's revisionist Oz\")]\n\nIn his [revisionist](/wiki/Revisionism_\\(fictional\\) \"Revisionism\n\\(fictional\\)\") Oz novels _[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of\nthe West](/wiki/Wicked:_The_Life_and_Times_of_the_Wicked_Witch_of_the_West\n\"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\")_ , _[Son of a\nWitch](/wiki/Son_of_a_Witch \"Son of a Witch\")_ , _[A Lion Among\nMen](/wiki/A_Lion_Among_Men \"A Lion Among Men\")_ and _[Out of\nOz](/wiki/Out_of_Oz \"Out of Oz\")_ , [Gregory Maguire](/wiki/Gregory_Maguire\n\"Gregory Maguire\") portrays a very different version of the Land of Oz.\nMaguire's Oz is not Baum's utopia, but a land troubled by political unrest and\neconomic hardship. One political issue in Maguire's novels is the oppression\nof the Animals (Maguire distinguishes speaking Animals from non-speaking\nanimals by the use of initial capital letters). There are many religious\ntraditions in Maguire's Oz, including Lurlinism (which regards the Fairy\nLurline as Oz's creator), Unionism, which worships the Unnamed God, and the\npleasure faiths which had swept Oz during the time that the witches were at\nShiz. An example of the pleasure faiths were tic-toc (where creatures were\nenchanted to tell secrets or the future and run by clockwork), and sorcery.\n\nMaguire's presentation of Oz's geography is also tinged with politics. A large\npolitical prison, Southstairs, exists in caverns below the Emerald City.\nGillikin, home of Shiz University, has more industrial development than other\nparts of Oz. Munchkinland is Oz's breadbasket and at one point declares its\nindependence from the rule of the Emerald City. Quadling Country is largely\nmarshland, inhabited by the artistic and sexually free Quadlings. The Vinkus\n(Maguire's name for Winkie Country) is largely open grassland, populated by\nsemi-nomadic tribes with brown skin.\n\nThe musical _[Wicked](/wiki/Wicked_\\(musical\\) \"Wicked \\(musical\\)\")_ , based\non Maguire's first Oz novel, portrays an Oz slightly closer to the version\nseen in Baum's novels and the 1939 [film](/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_\\(1939_film\\)\n\"The Wizard of Oz \\(1939 film\\)\"). The oppression of the Animals is still a\ntheme, but the geographical and religious divisions portrayed in Maguire's\nnovel are barely present.\n\nIn both the book and musical, several characters from the traditional Oz\nstories are present with different names. Glinda is originally called Galinda,\nbut changes her name. The Wicked Witch of the West is called\n[Elphaba](/wiki/Elphaba \"Elphaba\"), the Wicked Witch of the East is called\n[Nessarose](/wiki/Nessarose \"Nessarose\"). In the musical, but not in the book,\n[Boq](/wiki/Boq \"Boq\") becomes the Tin Man, and [Fiyero](/wiki/Fiyero\n\"Fiyero\") becomes the Scarecrow.\n\n### Alexander Melentyevich Volkov's Magic\nLand[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: Alexander Melentyevich Volkov's Magic Land\")]\n\n[Alexander Melentyevich Volkov](/wiki/Alexander_Volkov_\\(writer\\) \"Alexander\nVolkov \\(writer\\)\") was a Russian author best known for his translation of\n_The Wizard of Oz_ into Russian, and for writing his own original sequels,\nwhich were based only loosely on Baum's. Volkov's books have been translated\ninto many other languages, and are better known than Baum's in some countries.\nThe books, while still aimed at children, feature many mature political and\nethical elements. They have been retranslated into English by Peter L.\nBlystone and partially by March Laumer, who used elements of them in his own\nbooks.\n\n### March Laumer's\nOz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section:\nMarch Laumer's Oz\")]\n\n[March Laumer](/wiki/March_Laumer \"March Laumer\") was one of the first authors\nto continue the Oz series after the Famous Forty. His books were written with\nthe permission of Contemporary Books, who owned [Reilly &\nLee](/wiki/Reilly_%26_Lee \"Reilly & Lee\"), the original publisher.[52] His\ncanon includes everything he knew of that was set in the land of Oz, including\nVolkov's Russian Oz, the MGM movie, the Disney sequel, and many of Baum's own\nbooks that most fans do not consider canonical.\n\nLaumer also made several controversial changes to Oz. He married off several\nof the major characters, often to unlikely prospects. For example, the\nintelligent and mature sorceress Glinda was married to Button Bright, who had\nbeen a small and dim-witted child throughout Baum's books. He also aged\nDorothy to a teenager to make her a romantic prospect for several characters,\nmade Ozma a [lesbian](/wiki/Lesbian \"Lesbian\") based on her upbringing as a\nboy, and made the Shaggy Man an [ephebophile](/wiki/Ephebophile \"Ephebophile\")\nbased on his frequent travels with young girls.\n\nLaumer's books do not portray one consistent version of Oz. Because most of\nhis books were collaborations, he often included elements of other author's\nvisions of Oz which may have been inconsistent with his own. For example,\nwhile he explicitly made Dorothy sixteen in _A Fairy Queen in Oz_ , he had her\nphysically eight in _Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz_ ; and while he portrayed\nVolkov's Oz as a parallel universe in _Farewell to Oz_ he also showed Volkov's\ncharacters living in Baum's Oz in many of his other books, such as _Aunt Em\nand Uncle Henry in Oz_. Despite these discrepancies, many of his books are\nconsistent with each other, and characters introduced in some often appear in\nothers.[53]\n\n### Philip José Farmer's\nOz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section:\nPhilip José Farmer's Oz\")]\n\n[Philip José Farmer](/wiki/Philip_Jos%C3%A9_Farmer \"Philip José Farmer\")\nportrays a very different Oz in his book _[A Barnstormer in\nOz](/wiki/A_Barnstormer_in_Oz \"A Barnstormer in Oz\")_. The premise is that\nnothing after the first book occurred—Dorothy never returned to Oz, and\ninstead grew up, got married, and had a son. Her son, Hank Stover, is the main\ncharacter, a [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\") veteran flier and\nthe titular barnstormer. While flying in his [Curtiss JN-4](/wiki/Curtiss_JN-4\n\"Curtiss JN-4\") [biplane](/wiki/Biplane \"Biplane\") he enters a green haze and\nemerges in the civil war-stricken land of Oz.\n\nFarmer portrays the land of Oz as a [science fiction](/wiki/Science_fiction\n\"Science fiction\") author, attempting to explain scientifically many of the\n\"magical\" elements of Baum's story.\n\n### Robert A. Heinlein's\nOz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section:\nRobert A. Heinlein's Oz\")]\n\n[Robert A. Heinlein](/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein \"Robert A. Heinlein\")'s book,\n_[The Number of the Beast](/wiki/The_Number_of_the_Beast_\\(novel\\) \"The Number\nof the Beast \\(novel\\)\")_ passes through many famous fictional worlds\nincluding those of [Alice in Wonderland](/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland \"Alice in\nWonderland\"); [Gulliver's Travels](/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels \"Gulliver's\nTravels\"), specifically [Lilliput](/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu \"Lilliput and\nBlefuscu\"); [E.E. \"Doc\" Smith](/wiki/E.E._%22Doc%22_Smith \"E.E. \"Doc\"\nSmith\")'s [Lensman](/wiki/Lensman \"Lensman\") universe; [Asgard](/wiki/Asgard\n\"Asgard\"), connected to Heinlein's own Future History universe by the Rainbow\nBridge for one specific reason in one specific location; and\n[Ringworld](/wiki/Ringworld \"Ringworld\")[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]; as\nwell as some of Heinlein's own works, specifically those set in his Future\nHistory through which Lazarus Long moves; and of course the Land of Oz itself.\n\nThe Oz portrayed in the book is very close to Baum's Oz, although Heinlein\ndoes make an attempt to explain some things from the standpoint of a science\nfiction author. He explains that Oz is on a retrograde planet, where the\ndirection of rotation relative to the poles is reversed, resulting in the sun\nseeming to rise in what would normally be the west.\n\nHeinlein also explains that the population remains steady in Oz despite the\nlack of death because it is impossible for children to be born in Oz. When the\npopulation does increase through immigration, Glinda just extends the borders\nan inch or two in each direction, which makes more than enough space for all\nadditional people.\n\n### L. Sprague de Camp's\nOz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section:\nL. Sprague de Camp's Oz\")]\n\n[L. Sprague de Camp](/wiki/L._Sprague_de_Camp \"L. Sprague de Camp\"), like\nHeinlein, brings his own characters to Oz in his book _[Sir Harold and the\nGnome King](/wiki/Sir_Harold_and_the_Gnome_King \"Sir Harold and the Gnome\nKing\")_ , part of the originally collaborative [Harold Shea](/wiki/Harold_Shea\n\"Harold Shea\") series. Unlike Heinlein, he does not attempt to explain Oz as\nscience fiction, though he does deviate from the original corpus. He follows\nThompson's Oz books, thus using her spelling of \"Gnome\" and her final fate of\nthe character, but he postulates an incident that has removed the Ozites'\nimmortality, with the result that both Ozma and Dorothy have aged and married\nby the time his story takes place.\n\n### Tad Williams' Otherland\nOz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit section:\nTad Williams' Otherland Oz\")]\n\nIn the [Otherland](/wiki/Otherland \"Otherland\") series, by [Tad\nWilliams](/wiki/Tad_Williams \"Tad Williams\"), a virtual reality version of Oz\nexists, wherein real-world antagonists play sadistic versions of the roles of\nthe Tin Man, The Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion, in a twisted, martial, and\npost-apocalyptic version of Oz, populated both by characters from the novels,\nand a large quantity of male and female humans who go by the names \"Henry\" and\n\"Em\" respectively.

It is implied, by reference to centuries\nhaving elapsed since Dorothy came to the O.Z., that time has progressed at\ndifferent rates in the O.Z. and \"the other side\".

In particular, there are many\nmagic items which play an important role in the series.\n\n### Silver Shoes/Ruby\nSlippers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=29 \"Edit\nsection: Silver Shoes/Ruby Slippers\")]\n\nWhen Dorothy leaves Oz after having several adventures there and befriending\nmany of Oz's natives, she is magically carried over the [Deadly\nDesert](/wiki/Deadly_Desert \"Deadly Desert\") by means of the charmed [Silver\nShoes](/wiki/Silver_Shoes \"Silver Shoes\") she had been given shortly after her\nunexpected arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair's\nowner, the [Wicked Witch of the East](/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_East \"Wicked\nWitch of the East\"). After knocking her heels together three times and wishing\nto return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The\nshoes however, slip off of Dorothy's feet and are lost forever in the desert.\nBaum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film the shoes\nare changed to [Ruby Slippers](/wiki/Ruby_Slippers \"Ruby Slippers\"). When\nDorothy clicks her heels together she closes her eyes and says: _\" Theres no\nplace like home_\". She then wakes up in her bedroom in Kansas believing her\nexperience in Oz to be an elaborate dream.\n\nThe silver shoes and ruby slippers are also used in several other versions\nincluding _Wicked_ by [Gregory Maguire](/wiki/Gregory_Maguire \"Gregory\nMaguire\"). Here the shoes are constructed as a gift and have a chameleon\neffect. They are decorated with thousands of glittering glass beads that\nchange colors according to the lighting. They can also appear to be several\ndifferent colors all at once. The shoes are also lost when Dorothy is\nteleported back home just like in Baum's novel. The Broadway musical based on\nMaguire's book further shows that they were all silver, but were changed to\nruby red by a spell put upon them by the Witch of the West\n[Elphaba](/wiki/Elphaba \"Elphaba\"), enabling her sister the Witch of the East\n[Nessarose](/wiki/Nessarose \"Nessarose\"), who prior had been confined to a\nwheelchair, to magically walk.\n\nA little-known adaptation of the original story made for British television in\nthe mid-90's starring [Denise van Outen](/wiki/Denise_van_Outen \"Denise van\nOuten\") explained that they had belonged to a visitor from over the rainbow\nwho came to Oz before Dorothy and they were obtained by the Witch when the\nvisitor wished herself home and they fell off her feet on the return trip.\n\n### Powder of Life[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Powder of Life\")]\n\nThe **Powder of Life** is a magic substance from the book series, which first\nappears in _[The Marvelous Land of Oz](/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz \"The\nMarvelous Land of Oz\")_.\n\nIt is a magical powder that brings inanimate objects to life. The\n[witch](/wiki/Witchcraft \"Witchcraft\") [Mombi](/wiki/Mombi \"Mombi\") first\nobtained it from a \"crooked magician.\" Later in the series it is revealed that\nthe substance is made by a [Dr. Pipt](/wiki/Dr._Pipt_\\(Oz\\) \"Dr. Pipt\n\\(Oz\\)\"). In order to make the substance, Dr. Pipt had to stir four large\n[cauldrons](/wiki/Cauldron \"Cauldron\") for six years. Only a few grains of the\npowder could be made at a time. It is always described as being carried in a\n[pepper](/wiki/Black_pepper \"Black pepper\") box.\n\nIn _[The Marvelous Land of Oz](/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz \"The Marvelous\nLand of Oz\")_ , the Powder of Life was used to bring Jack Pumpkinhead, the\nSawhorse, and [the Gump](/wiki/The_Gump_\\(Oz\\) \"The Gump \\(Oz\\)\") to life. In\n_[The Patchwork Girl of Oz](/wiki/The_Patchwork_Girl_of_Oz \"The Patchwork Girl\nof Oz\")_ it brings the title character to life, also the glass cat and a\nphonograph.\n\nMombi's shaker also contained three \"wishing pills\" fabricated by Dr. Nikidik.\n\nThe Powder has been used by Volkov in his series. There, it is produced from a\ncertain plant of such viability that the smallest piece can grow into a plant\nwithin a day, on any surface except for solid metal. However, if it is sun\ndried on such a surface, it turns into the Powder of Life. No incantation is\nrequired to make the powder work. The second book of the series is centered\naround a man who animates an army of wooden soldiers with the Powder and uses\nthem for conquering the Magic Land.\n\nIn _[Return to Oz](/wiki/Return_to_Oz \"Return to Oz\")_ , the magic words to\nbring the inanimate object to life were \"WEAUGH, TEAUGH, PEAUGH\".\n\n### Magic Belt[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Magic Belt\")]\n\nThe **Magic Belt** is first introduced in _[Ozma of Oz](/wiki/Ozma_of_Oz \"Ozma\nof Oz\")_. Originally the belt belonged to the [Nome King](/wiki/Nome_King\n\"Nome King\"), but [Dorothy Gale](/wiki/Dorothy_Gale \"Dorothy Gale\") stole it\nand defeated him. When she leaves Oz, she gives it to\n[Ozma](/wiki/Princess_Ozma \"Princess Ozma\") for safekeeping.\n\nIn most Oz books, the Magic Belt grants its wearer the ability to transform\nanyone into any form, and the ability to transport anyone anywhere, and also\nmakes its wearer impervious to harm. In some books, it also grants limited\nwishes.\n\nIn _[Ozma of Oz](/wiki/Ozma_of_Oz \"Ozma of Oz\")_ , its power is limited: its\nmagic cannot affect objects which are made of wood.\n\nIn non-canonical _[The Oz Kids](/wiki/The_Oz_Kids \"The Oz Kids\")_ animated\nseries, the Magic Belt belonged to Dot.\n\n### Magic Picture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Magic Picture\")]\n\nIn Ozma's boudoir hangs a picture in a radium frame. This picture usually\nappears to be of a pleasant countryside, but when anyone wishes for the\npicture to show a particular person or place, the scene will display what is\nwished for. Sometimes the onlooker is able to hear sounds from the scene\nwithin the Magic Picture and sometimes an additional device is necessary to\ntransmit sound.\n\nA similar device is present in Volkov's series. There, it is given as a\npresent to the Scarecrow by the [Good Witch of the\nSouth](/wiki/Glinda_the_Good_Witch \"Glinda the Good Witch\"). It is a box of\npink wood with a thick frosted glass screen. The device is password activated,\nand limited in range to the Magic Land (with the exception of deep underground\ncaverns and certain types of magical interference). The box is shown to be\nvirtually indestructible; it withstood repeated abuse from a villain\nattempting to use it.\n\n### Great Book of\nRecords[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit\nsection: Great Book of Records\")]\n\n\"Great Book of Records\" redirects here. It is not to be confused with\n[Guinness World Records](/wiki/Guinness_World_Records \"Guinness World\nRecords\").\n\nGlinda's **Great Book of Records** is introduced in Chapter 29 of _[The\nEmerald City of Oz](/wiki/The_Emerald_City_of_Oz \"The Emerald City of Oz\")_ :\n\" 'It is a record of everything that happens,' replied the Sorceress. 'As soon\nas an event takes place, anywhere in the world, it is immediately found\nprinted in my Magic Book. So when I read its pages I am well informed.' \" The\nBook proves useful in _[The Scarecrow of Oz](/wiki/The_Scarecrow_of_Oz \"The\nScarecrow of Oz\")_ and _[Glinda of Oz](/wiki/Glinda_of_Oz \"Glinda of Oz\")_ ;\nand it recurs in many of the stories of Baum's successors and imitators. It is\none of the prime magic devices of Oz; villains steal it when they can (as in\n_[The Lost Princess of Oz](/wiki/The_Lost_Princess_of_Oz \"The Lost Princess of\nOz\")_ or in _[Handy Mandy in Oz](/wiki/Handy_Mandy_in_Oz \"Handy Mandy in\nOz\")_). Since it covers the planet and not merely Oz, the Book's entries are\ncompressed and sometimes cryptic, and difficult to decipher (as in _[Paradox\nin Oz](/wiki/Paradox_in_Oz \"Paradox in Oz\")_ or _[Queen Ann in\nOz](/wiki/Queen_Ann_in_Oz \"Queen Ann in Oz\")_).\n\nThe book is also featured in fantasy series Once Upon a Time. Zelena reads the\nbook ignoring Glinda's warning and turns green again because she felt betrayed\nas it was mentioned in the book that Dorothy would save Oz from a great evil\n(Zelena thought that evil was her but this was never revealed).\n\n### The Love\nMagnet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit\nsection: The Love Magnet\")]\n\nA rusty-looking horseshoe magnet which causes everyone to love its owner. It\nis closely associated with the [Shaggy Man](/wiki/Shaggy_Man \"Shaggy Man\"). In\n_[The Road to Oz](/wiki/The_Road_to_Oz \"The Road to Oz\")_ , he finds that\nbeing loved by everyone can be inconvenient. In _[Tik-Tok of Oz](/wiki/Tik-\nTok_of_Oz \"Tik-Tok of Oz\")_ he reveals that Ozma has modified its powers so\nthat it only works when it is displayed and affects only the feelings of those\nwho see it. It is an essential plot-element in _[The Shaggy Man of\nOz](/wiki/The_Shaggy_Man_of_Oz \"The Shaggy Man of Oz\")_. Ozma keeps it hanging\nover the gate into the Emerald City, so that all who enter will come with\nlove, although this does not always seem to happen.\n\n### Magic Fan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Magic Fan\")]\n\nThe Magic Fan is brought to Oz by Dorothy in _[The Royal Book of\nOz](/wiki/The_Royal_Book_of_Oz \"The Royal Book of Oz\")_. Several subsequent\nbooks mention it. It creates a powerful wind, capable of blowing away an\ninvading army.\n\n### Fountain of\nOblivion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=36 \"Edit\nsection: Fountain of Oblivion\")]\n\nA fountain in the Emerald City, anyone who drinks from it forgets everything\nhe knows, including his own name. It is used against the Nome King in _[The\nEmerald City of Oz](/wiki/The_Emerald_City_of_Oz \"The Emerald City of Oz\")_\nand again in _[The Magic of Oz](/wiki/The_Magic_of_Oz \"The Magic of Oz\")_.\n\n### Magic Dinner\nBell[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=37 \"Edit\nsection: Magic Dinner Bell\")]\n\nCreated by the [Red Jinn](/wiki/Jinnicky \"Jinnicky\"), it summons a slave named\nGinger, who appears bearing a tray full of delicious food when the bell is\nrung. Besides providing food, the bell also provides a means of escape from\ndanger: anyone who holds onto the slave when he disappears after bringing the\nfood is transported with him to the Red Jinn's castle. There are actually two\nmagic dinner bells, one in the Emerald City and another which the Red Jinn\nkeeps for himself and uses while traveling. The bell is first introduced in\n_[Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz](/wiki/Jack_Pumpkinhead_of_Oz \"Jack Pumpkinhead of\nOz\")_ and also appears in _[The Purple Prince of\nOz](/wiki/The_Purple_Prince_of_Oz \"The Purple Prince of Oz\")_ and _[The Silver\nPrincess in Oz](/wiki/The_Silver_Princess_in_Oz \"The Silver Princess in Oz\")_.\n\n## Miscellaneous[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=38\n\"Edit section: Miscellaneous\")]\n\n### Death in Oz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=39\n\"Edit section: Death in Oz\")]\n\nIn the later Oz books, no one can die. One of the books assures us that while\nyou are in the Land of Oz, you cannot die. Unfortunately, this information\ncomes _after_ characters in the books have been chopped into pieces, beheaded,\nmelted, and so forth and it is mentioned that you could be transformed into an\ninanimate object, turned into sand, and buried. Even so, you would still be\nalive and presumably conscious.\n\nBaum puts it this way in the third chapter of _[The Emerald City of\nOz](/wiki/The_Emerald_City_of_Oz \"The Emerald City of Oz\")_ :\n\n    \"No disease of any sort was ever known among the Ozites, and so no one ever died unless he met with an accident that prevented him from living.\"\n\nNote also the spell which caused this also prevented aging, and took effect on\neveryone in Oz at the same time; this means that any babies in Oz are\neternally babies, and that anyone who was at the moment of death is\npermanently caught there, and so on.\n\n#### Theories[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=40\n\"Edit section: Theories\")]\n\nDeath is treated inconsistently; in some books it is said that it is\nimpossible to die, in others, people die. Problematically, the plot often\ndepends on something either dying, or not being killable.\n\n_The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ shows an early example of the problem: although\nthe Tin Woodman does not die when his limbs and head are severed, the two\nwicked witches are killed (The Wicked Witch of the East could be explained\nthat she was simply crushed and not really dead, but couldn't do anything\nanyway, and in _[The Oz\nOdyssey](/w/index.php?title=The_Oz_Odyssey&action=edit&redlink=1 \"The Oz\nOdyssey \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ , the Wicked Witch of the West comes back\nto life.) One theory brought forth as to why the Tin Woodman does not die is\ndiscussed in [Edward Einhorn](/wiki/Edward_Einhorn \"Edward Einhorn\")'s book\n\"[Paradox in Oz](/wiki/Paradox_in_Oz \"Paradox in Oz\")\", where King Oz says\nthat the Tin Woodman (then Nick Chopper) would have died were it not for his\ntime magic. When the Tin Woodman rescues the Queen of the Field Mice by\nchopping off the head of a pursuing wildcat, it seems unlikely the cat's\nunjoined head and body continue to live independently of each other, although\nthis goes unmentioned. Again, although the Tin Woodman survived losing all his\nbody, prior to that, he had grown up and lost his parents in a manner\ninconsistent with later descriptions of Oz.[57] Again, in _[Ozma of\nOz](/wiki/Ozma_of_Oz \"Ozma of Oz\")_ , Jack Pumpkinhead was described as \"a\nlittle overripe\", and in _[Dorothy and the Wizard in\nOz](/wiki/Dorothy_and_the_Wizard_in_Oz \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\")_ , he\ndoes not appear at all, although all the other characters do reappear; the\nimplication is that he spoiled, as he feared from his creation.[58] It is\nunlikely, however, since, according to the [previous\nbook](/wiki/The_Road_to_Oz \"The Road to Oz\"), while a pumpkin which serves as\nJack's head can spoil, it can be replaced, which was done several times\nwithout a problem.\n\nBoth _Ozma of Oz_ and _Tik-Tok of Oz_ describe trees with meat growing on\nthem, so it is possible that no animal was killed for most of the meat eaten\nin Oz. However, in _Tin Woodman of Oz_ a hungry Jaguar tries to eat a live\nmonkey, suggesting that occasionally (among non-human animals, at least)\nanimal flesh is preferred to that of plants.\n\nAnother of Baum's attempts to explain death in Oz is the following passage\nfrom _The Emerald City of Oz_.\n\n    _No disease of any sort was ever known among the Ozites, and no one ever died unless he met with an accident that prevented him from living._\n\nThis passage has been translated by some fans to mean that one ceases to live\nif one's body is damaged to the extent that it cannot be repaired. However, in\n_Tik-Tok of Oz_ Baum suggested that Oz people could go on living after being\neaten and digested, and also that Nomes would continue to live after being cut\ninto tiny pieces, which disproves the destruction theory.\n\n### Talking\nanimals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=41 \"Edit\nsection: Talking animals\")]\n\nIn Oz, animals such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger can talk, and\nall native animals appear to be capable of speech. _[Wicked: The Life and\nTimes of the Wicked Witch of the\nWest](/wiki/Wicked:_The_Life_and_Times_of_the_Wicked_Witch_of_the_West\n\"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\")_ emphasized the\ndifference between Animals and animals. Animals (capitalized) are sentient\nbeings that can talk. Several theories exist as to how animals gained the gift\nof speech.\n\nThe treatment of non-native animals was inconsistent. In the first book, the\n[dog](/wiki/Dog \"Dog\") [Toto](/wiki/Toto_\\(dog\\) \"Toto \\(dog\\)\") never speaks,\nalthough brought to Oz; in _The Patchwork Girl of Oz_ , Dorothy specifies that\nhe cannot speak because he is not a fairy dog. However, in _Ozma of Oz_ , the\n[chicken](/wiki/Chicken \"Chicken\") [Billina](/wiki/Billina \"Billina\") acquires\nspeech merely by being swept to the lands near Oz, and in _[Dorothy and the\nWizard in Oz](/wiki/Dorothy_and_the_Wizard_in_Oz \"Dorothy and the Wizard in\nOz\")_ , the same is true of the kitten Eureka and the cab [horse](/wiki/Horse\n\"Horse\") Jim when reaching the land of Mangaboos, a similarly magical land. In\n_[Tik-Tok of Oz](/wiki/Tik-Tok_of_Oz \"Tik-Tok of Oz\")_ , Baum restored the\n[continuity](/wiki/Continuity_\\(fiction\\) \"Continuity \\(fiction\\)\"): Toto can\nspeak, and always could, but never bothered to, because it was unnecessary.\n\nAn additional inconsistency is introduced with _Tik-Tok of Oz_ : Hank the Mule\ncannot speak until reaching the Land of Oz, although he lands on the shore of\nEv first, where Billina the chicken gained the ability to speak. This might be\nbecause _Tik-Tok of Oz_ was originally a stageplay version of _Ozma of Oz_ ;\nDorothy was replaced by Betsy because he had sold the stage rights for\nDorothy, and Billina was replaced by Hank because a mule could more\nconvincingly be played by two people in a costume.[59] Hank probably could not\ntalk because Baum already had two speaking comedy characters, the Shaggy Man\nand Tik-Tok. Thus Hank would fill a better niche as a visual comedy character,\nin the tradition of British pantomime. The part of Hank was also an analog to\nthe part of Dorothy's cow Imogene, Toto's replacement on stage in the\nimmensely successful 1903 Broadway version of _[The Wizard of\nOz](/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_\\(1902_stage_play\\) \"The Wizard of Oz \\(1902 stage\nplay\\)\")_ , a success that Baum sought to duplicate for the rest of his life.\n\nThere is one small kingdom in Oz where animals are unable to talk:\nCorumbia.[60]\n\n### Origin of the name\nOz[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=42 \"Edit section:\nOrigin of the name Oz\")]\n\nA legend of uncertain validity is that when relating bedtime stories (the\nearliest form of the Oz books) Baum was asked by his niece, Ramona Baxter\nBowden, the name of the magical land. He glanced at a nearby filing cabinet,\nwhich had three drawers, labeled A–G, H–N, and O–Z. Thus he named the land Oz.\nThis story was first told in 1903, but his wife always insisted that the part\nabout the filing cabinet was not true.[61] In _[Dorothy and the Wizard in\nOz](/wiki/Dorothy_and_the_Wizard_in_Oz \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\")_ , the\nname is translated as \"great and good\". It has also been speculated that Oz\nwas named after the abbreviation for [ounce](/wiki/Ounce \"Ounce\"), in the\ntheory that Oz is an allegory for the populist struggle against the illusion\n(the wizard) of the [gold standard](/wiki/Gold_standard \"Gold\nstandard\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOthers have said that Oz stands for [New York](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New\nYork \\(state\\)\")[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_], since the letters of the alphabet before O and\nZ are N and Y respectively. However, this works just as well with Oz standing\nfor [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"), because the letters\nfollowing O and Z are P and A (starting again at the beginning of the\nalphabet).[_[original research?](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research\n\"Wikipedia:No original research\")_]\n\nSeveral of Baum's fairy stories that take place in the United States were\nsituated on the [Ozark Plateau](/wiki/Ozark_Plateau \"Ozark Plateau\"), and the\nsimilarity of name may not be a coincidence.[62]\n\n_Oz_ is a common vernacular contraction of _[Australia](/wiki/Australia\n\"Australia\")_ (Australia—Aussie—Aus—Oz). Australia is a large continent\npredominated by desert regions, with pockets of intense green tropical, sub-\ntropical and sub-alpine greenlands and rainforests. It is quite possible that\nBaum took the popular nickname of Australia as the national name for his\nfictional world. Also note that many fans place Oz in the South Pacific, see\n[Location](/wiki/Land_of_Oz#Location \"Land of Oz\") above. However, according\nto the [Oxford English dictionary](/wiki/Oxford_English_dictionary \"Oxford\nEnglish dictionary\"), the first references to Australia by this name were made\nin 1902—after the first book had been published. Nevertheless, spoken\nreferences would certainly have been in use before first appearing in print\n(as noted by Oxford), hence possibly before the writing of the book.\n\nIt is also possible that it is based on the\n\"[Óg](/w/index.php?title=%C3%93g&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Óg \\(page does not\nexist\\)\")\" in [Tír na nÓg](/wiki/T%C3%ADr_na_n%C3%93g \"Tír na nÓg\"). While no\ndirect link between the mythology of Oz and the realm of Irish folklore has\nbeen conclusively proven, certain similarities, for instance [Ogma](/wiki/Ogma\n\"Ogma\") and [Princess Ozma](/wiki/Princess_Ozma \"Princess Ozma\"), are\ncompelling.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Land_of_Oz&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** _Emerald City of Oz_ , p. 30\n  2. **Jump up ^** James Thurber, \"The Wizard of Chitenango\", in _Fantasists on Fantasy_ , edited by Robert H.
