The event is organised by the sport's governing\nbody, [World Rugby](/wiki/World_Rugby \"World Rugby\"), and is contested by 12\nmen's junior national teams with an under-20 age requirement. This event\nreplaced the IRB's former age-grade world championships, the [Under\n19](/wiki/Under_19_Rugby_World_Championship \"Under 19 Rugby World\nChampionship\") and [Under 21](/wiki/Under_21_Rugby_World_Championship \"Under\n21 Rugby World Championship\") World Championships.\n\nThe inaugural tournament was held in June 2008, hosted by [Wales](/wiki/Wales\n\"Wales\") and with 16 teams participating. Wales was announced as host for the\ninaugural tournament in November 2007.[1] The number of participating nations\nwas reduced to 12 before the 2010 tournament due to financial reasons.[2]\n\nThe U20 Championship is the upper level of the World Rugby tournament\nstructure for under-20 national sides. At the same time that the U20\nChampionship was launched, World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby\nBoard) also launched a second-level competition, the [U20\nTrophy](/wiki/World_Rugby_Under_20_Trophy \"World Rugby Under 20 Trophy\"),\nfeaturing eight teams.\n\nPromotion and relegation between the Trophy and the Championship is in place.\nThe winner of the Trophy will play in next year's Championship, while the last\nplaced team at the Championship will be relegated to the Trophy for the next\nyear.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Tournament results\n  *
