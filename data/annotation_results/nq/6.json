\"[Judah](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah \"Kingdom of\nJudah\")\";[1][2] via [Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") and\n[Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek \"Ancient Greek\")) is the religion of the [Jewish\npeople](/wiki/Jews \"Jews\"). It is an ancient,\n[monotheistic](/wiki/Monotheistic \"Monotheistic\"), [Abrahamic\nreligion](/wiki/Abrahamic_religion \"Abrahamic religion\") with the\n[Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") as its foundational text.[3] It encompasses the\n[religion](/wiki/Religion \"Religion\"), [philosophy](/wiki/Philosophy\n\"Philosophy\"), and [culture](/wiki/Culture \"Culture\") of the [Jewish\npeople](/wiki/Jewish_people \"Jewish people\").[4] Judaism is considered by\nreligious Jews to be the expression of the [covenant](/wiki/Mosaic_covenant\n\"Mosaic covenant\") that [God](/wiki/God_in_Judaism \"God in Judaism\")\nestablished with the [Children of Israel](/wiki/Children_of_Israel \"Children\nof Israel\").[5] Judaism encompasses a wide corpus of texts, practices,\ntheological positions, and forms of organization. The Torah is part of the\nlarger text known as the [Tanakh](/wiki/Tanakh \"Tanakh\") or the [Hebrew\nBible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible \"Hebrew Bible\"), and supplemental oral tradition\nrepresented by later texts such as the [Midrash](/wiki/Midrash \"Midrash\") and\nthe [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\"). With between 14.5 and 17.4 million\nadherents worldwide,[6] Judaism is [the tenth largest religion in the\nworld](/wiki/Major_religious_groups#Religious_demographics \"Major religious\ngroups\").\n\nWithin Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from\n[Rabbinic Judaism](/wiki/Rabbinic_Judaism \"Rabbinic Judaism\"), which holds\nthat God revealed his laws and [commandments](/wiki/613_Mitzvot \"613 Mitzvot\")\nto [Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\") on [Mount Sinai](/wiki/Biblical_Mount_Sinai\n\"Biblical Mount Sinai\") in the form of both the [Written](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\")\nand [Oral Torah](/wiki/Oral_Torah \"Oral Torah\").[7] Historically, this\nassertion was challenged by various groups such as the\n[Sadducees](/wiki/Sadducees#General \"Sadducees\") and [Hellenistic\nJudaism](/wiki/Hellenistic_Judaism \"Hellenistic Judaism\") during the [Second\nTemple period](/wiki/Second_Temple_period \"Second Temple period\"); the\n[Karaites](/wiki/Karaite_Judaism#Karaite_interpretations_of_the_Torah \"Karaite\nJudaism\") and [Sabbateans](/wiki/Sabbateans \"Sabbateans\") during the early and\nlater medieval period;[8] and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox\ndenominations. Modern branches of Judaism such as [Humanistic\nJudaism](/wiki/Humanistic_Judaism \"Humanistic Judaism\") may be\n[nontheistic](/wiki/Nontheistic \"Nontheistic\").[9] Today, the largest [Jewish\nreligious movements](/wiki/Jewish_religious_movements \"Jewish religious\nmovements\") are [Orthodox Judaism](/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism \"Orthodox Judaism\")\n([Haredi Judaism](/wiki/Haredi_Judaism \"Haredi Judaism\") and [Modern Orthodox\nJudaism](/wiki/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism \"Modern Orthodox Judaism\")),\n[Conservative Judaism](/wiki/Conservative_Judaism \"Conservative Judaism\"), and\n[Reform Judaism](/wiki/Reform_Judaism \"Reform Judaism\"). Major sources of\ndifference between these groups are their approaches to [Jewish\nlaw](/wiki/Jewish_law \"Jewish law\"), the authority of the [Rabbinic\ntradition](/wiki/Rabbinic_tradition \"Rabbinic tradition\"), and the\nsignificance of the [State of Israel](/wiki/State_of_Israel \"State of\nIsrael\").[10] Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are\ndivine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly\nfollowed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more\n[liberal](/wiki/Religious_liberalism \"Religious liberalism\"), with\nConservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation\nof Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is\nthat Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as\na set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all\nJews.[11][12] Historically, [special courts](/wiki/Beth_din \"Beth din\")\nenforced Jewish law; today, these courts still exist but the practice of\nJudaism is mostly voluntary.[13] Authority on theological and legal matters is\nnot vested in any one person or organization, but in the sacred texts and the\n[rabbis](/wiki/Rabbis \"Rabbis\") and scholars who interpret them.[14]\n\nThe [history of Judaism](/wiki/History_of_Judaism \"History of Judaism\") spans\nmore than 3,000 years.[15] Judaism has its roots as an [organized\nreligion](/wiki/Organized_religion \"Organized religion\") in the [Middle\nEast](/wiki/Middle_East \"Middle East\") during the [Bronze\nAge](/wiki/Bronze_Age \"Bronze Age\").[16] Judaism is considered one of the\noldest monotheistic religions.[17][18] The [Hebrews](/wiki/Hebrews \"Hebrews\")\nand [Israelites](/wiki/Israelites \"Israelites\") were already referred to as\n\"Jews\" in later books of the Tanakh such as the [Book of\nEsther](/wiki/Book_of_Esther \"Book of Esther\"), with the term Jews replacing\nthe title \"Children of Israel\".[19] Judaism's texts, traditions and values\nstrongly influenced later [Abrahamic religions](/wiki/Abrahamic_religions\n\"Abrahamic religions\"), including [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity\n\"Christianity\"), [Islam](/wiki/Islam \"Islam\") and the [Baha'i\nFaith](/wiki/Baha%27i_Faith \"Baha'i Faith\").[20][21] Many aspects of Judaism\nhave also directly or indirectly influenced [secular](/wiki/Secular \"Secular\")\n[Western](/wiki/Western_world \"Western world\") [ethics](/wiki/Ethics \"Ethics\")\nand [civil law](/wiki/Civil_law_\\(legal_system\\) \"Civil law \\(legal\nsystem\\)\").[22][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] [Hebraism](/wiki/Hebraism \"Hebraism\") was just\nas important a factor in the ancient era development of [Western\ncivilization](/wiki/Western_civilization \"Western civilization\") as\n[Hellenism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hellenism \"wikt:Hellenism\"), and\nJudaism, as the background of [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity\n\"Christianity\"), has considerably shaped Western ideals and morality since\n[Early Christianity](/wiki/Early_Christianity \"Early Christianity\").[23]\n\nJews are an [ethnoreligious group](/wiki/Ethnoreligious_group \"Ethnoreligious\ngroup\")[24] including those born Jewish, in addition to [converts to\nJudaism](/wiki/Converts_to_Judaism \"Converts to Judaism\").

consequently, the Hebrew God's principal relationships are not\nwith other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he\ncreated.[26][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\")_] Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God\nis one and is concerned with the actions of mankind.[27] According to the\n[Tanakh](/wiki/Tanakh \"Tanakh\") (Hebrew Bible), God promised\n[Abraham](/wiki/Abraham \"Abraham\") to make of his offspring a great\nnation.[28] Many generations later, he commanded the nation of\n[Israel](/wiki/Israelites \"Israelites\") to love and worship only one God; that\nis, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world.[29] He\nalso commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to\nimitate God's love for people.[30] These commandments are but two of a large\ncorpus of [commandments](/wiki/613_mitzvot \"613 mitzvot\") and\n[laws](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\") that constitute this\n[covenant](/wiki/Covenant_\\(biblical\\) \"Covenant \\(biblical\\)\"), which is the\nsubstance of Judaism.\n\nThus, although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism\n([Kabbalah](/wiki/Kabbalah \"Kabbalah\")), Rabbinic scholar [Max\nKadushin](/wiki/Max_Kadushin \"Max Kadushin\") has characterized normative\nJudaism as \"normal mysticism\", because it involves everyday personal\nexperiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews.[31] This\nis played out through the observance of the [Halakha](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\")\n(Jewish law) and given verbal expression in the [Birkat Ha-\nMizvot](/wiki/List_of_Jewish_prayers_and_blessings \"List of Jewish prayers and\nblessings\"), the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive\ncommandment is to be fulfilled.\n\n    The ordinary, familiar, everyday things and occurrences we have, constitute occasions for the experience of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the _Berakhot_. _Kedushah_ , holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The _Birkat Ha-Mitzwot_ evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are [non-theurgic.](/wiki/Theurgy \"Theurgy\") And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a _Berakah_ is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the _occasions_ for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.[32]\n\nWhereas [Jewish philosophers](/wiki/Jewish_philosophy \"Jewish philosophy\")\noften debate whether God is [immanent](/wiki/Immanence \"Immanence\") or\n[transcendent](/wiki/Transcendence_\\(religion\\) \"Transcendence \\(religion\\)\"),\nand whether people have free will or their lives are determined,\n[Halakha](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\") is a system through which any Jew acts to\nbring God into the world.\n\nEthical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism.\nHowever, monotheism has not always been followed in practice. The Jewish Bible\n([Tanakh](/wiki/Tanakh \"Tanakh\")) records and repeatedly condemns the\nwidespread worship of other gods in [ancient Israel](/wiki/Ancient_Israel\n\"Ancient Israel\").[33] In the Greco-Roman era, many different interpretations\nof monotheism existed in Judaism, including the interpretations that gave rise\nto Christianity.[34]\n\nMoreover, some have argued that Judaism is a non-creedal religion that does\nnot require one to believe in God.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] For\nsome, observance of Jewish law is more important than belief in God _per\nse_.[35] In modern times, some liberal Jewish movements do not accept the\nexistence of a personified deity active in history.[36][37] The debate about\nwhether one can speak of authentic or normative Judaism is not only a debate\namong religious Jews but also among historians.[38]\n\n### Core tenets\n\nMain article: [Jewish principles of faith](/wiki/Jewish_principles_of_faith\n\"Jewish principles of faith\")\n\n13 Principles of Faith:\n\n  1.

According to Maimonides, any Jew who rejects even one of\nthese principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic.[40][41] Jewish\nscholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides'\nprinciples.[42][43]\n\nIn Maimonides' time, his list of tenets was criticized by [Hasdai\nCrescas](/wiki/Hasdai_Crescas \"Hasdai Crescas\") and [Joseph\nAlbo](/wiki/Joseph_Albo \"Joseph Albo\"). Albo and [the\nRaavad](/wiki/Abraham_ben_David \"Abraham ben David\") argued that Maimonides'\nprinciples contained too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of\nthe faith.\n\nAlong these lines, the ancient historian [Josephus](/wiki/Josephus \"Josephus\")\nemphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs,\nassociating [apostasy](/wiki/Apostasy \"Apostasy\") with a failure to observe\nJewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism\nincluded [circumcision](/wiki/Circumcision \"Circumcision\") and adherence to\ntraditional customs. Maimonides' principles were largely ignored over the next\nfew centuries.[44] Later, two poetic restatements of these principles (\"_[Ani\nMa'amin](/wiki/Ani_Ma%27amin \"Ani Ma'amin\")_\" and \"_[Yigdal](/wiki/Yigdal\n\"Yigdal\")_ \") became integrated into many Jewish liturgies,[45] leading to\ntheir eventual near-universal acceptance.[46][47]\n\nIn modern times, Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an\nexact religious dogma.[14][48] Because of this, many different variations on\nthe basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism.[42] Even so, all\n[Jewish religious movements](/wiki/Jewish_religious_movements \"Jewish\nreligious movements\") are, to a greater or lesser extent, based on the\nprinciples of the [Hebrew Bible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible \"Hebrew Bible\") and\nvarious commentaries such as the [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\") and\n[Midrash](/wiki/Midrash \"Midrash\"). Judaism also universally recognizes the\nBiblical [Covenant](/wiki/Covenant_\\(biblical\\) \"Covenant \\(biblical\\)\")\nbetween God and the [Patriarch](/wiki/Patriarchs_\\(Bible\\) \"Patriarchs\n\\(Bible\\)\") [Abraham](/wiki/Abraham \"Abraham\") as well as the additional\naspects of the Covenant revealed to [Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\"), who is\nconsidered Judaism's greatest [prophet](/wiki/Prophet\n\"Prophet\").[42][49][50][51][52] In the [Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah \"Mishnah\"), a\ncore text of [Rabbinic Judaism](/wiki/Rabbinic_Judaism \"Rabbinic Judaism\"),\nacceptance of the Divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential\naspect of Judaism and those who reject the Covenant forfeit their share in the\n[World to Come](/wiki/World_to_Come \"World to Come\").[53]\n\nEstablishing the core tenets of Judaism in the modern era is even more\ndifficult, given the number and diversity of the contemporary [Jewish\ndenominations](/wiki/Jewish_religious_movements \"Jewish religious movements\").\nEven if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of\nthe nineteenth and twentieth century, the matter remains complicated. Thus for\ninstance, [Joseph Soloveitchik's](/wiki/Joseph_B._Soloveitchik \"Joseph B.\nSoloveitchik\") (associated with the [Modern Orthodox\nmovement](/wiki/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism \"Modern Orthodox Judaism\")) answer to\nmodernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the\n[halakha](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\") whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the\nholiness down to the world. [Mordecai Kaplan](/wiki/Mordecai_Kaplan \"Mordecai\nKaplan\"), the founder of the [Reconstructionist\nJudaism](/wiki/Reconstructionist_Judaism \"Reconstructionist Judaism\"),\nabandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with\n[civilization](/wiki/Civilization \"Civilization\") and by means of the latter\nterm and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many\nJewish denominations as possible. In turn, [Solomon\nSchechter](/wiki/Solomon_Schechter \"Solomon Schechter\")'s [Conservative\nJudaism](/wiki/Conservative_Judaism \"Conservative Judaism\") was identical with\nthe tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the\nhistory of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means\nof the creative interpretation. Finally, [David\nPhilipson](/wiki/David_Philipson \"David Philipson\") draws the outlines of the\n[Reform movement](/wiki/Reform_Judaism \"Reform Judaism\") in Judaism by\nopposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes\nto the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement.[54]\n\n## Jewish religious texts\n\nThe following is a basic, structured list of the central works of Jewish\npractice and thought.\n\n  * [Tanakh](/wiki/Tanakh \"Tanakh\")[55] ([Hebrew Bible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible \"Hebrew Bible\")) and [Rabbinic literature](/wiki/Rabbinic_literature \"Rabbinic literature\")\n    * [Mesorah](/wiki/Masoretic_Text \"Masoretic Text\")\n    * [Targum](/wiki/Targum \"Targum\")\n    * Jewish Biblical [exegesis](/wiki/Exegesis \"Exegesis\") (also see [Midrash](/wiki/Midrash \"Midrash\") below)\n  * Works of the Talmudic Era (classic rabbinic literature) \n    * [Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah \"Mishnah\") and commentaries\n    * [Tosefta](/wiki/Tosefta \"Tosefta\") and the [minor tractates](/wiki/Minor_tractates \"Minor tractates\")\n    * [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\"): \n      * The Babylonian Talmud and commentaries\n      * [Jerusalem Talmud](/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud \"Jerusalem Talmud\") and commentaries\n  * [Midrashic](/wiki/Midrash \"Midrash\") literature: \n    * [Halakhic Midrash](/wiki/Midrash_Halakha \"Midrash Halakha\")\n    * [Aggadic Midrash](/wiki/Midrash#Aggadic_midrashim \"Midrash\")\n  * [Halakhic](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\") literature \n    * Major Codes of Jewish Law and Custom \n      * [Mishneh Torah](/wiki/Mishneh_Torah \"Mishneh Torah\") and commentaries\n      * [Tur](/wiki/Arba%27ah_Turim \"Arba'ah Turim\") and commentaries\n      * [Shulchan Aruch](/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch \"Shulchan Aruch\") and commentaries\n    * [Responsa](/wiki/Responsa \"Responsa\") literature\n  * Jewish Thought and Ethics \n    * [Jewish philosophy](/wiki/Jewish_philosophy \"Jewish philosophy\")\n    * [Musar literature](/wiki/Musar_literature \"Musar literature\") and other works of [Jewish ethics](/wiki/Jewish_ethics \"Jewish ethics\")\n    * [Kabbalah](/wiki/Kabbalah \"Kabbalah\")\n    * [Hasidic](/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism \"Hasidic Judaism\") works\n  * [Siddur](/wiki/Siddur \"Siddur\") and [Jewish liturgy](/wiki/Jewish_services \"Jewish services\")\n  * _[Piyyut](/wiki/Piyyut \"Piyyut\")_ (Classical Jewish poetry)\n\nMany traditional Jewish texts are available online in various [Torah\ndatabases](/wiki/Torah_database \"Torah database\") (electronic versions of the\nTraditional Jewish Bookshelf). Many of these have advanced search options\navailable.\n\n### Jewish legal literature\n\nMain article: [Halakha](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\")\n\nThe basis of Jewish law and tradition (halakha) is the [Torah](/wiki/Torah\n\"Torah\") (also known as the [Pentateuch](/wiki/Pentateuch \"Pentateuch\") or the\nFive Books of Moses). According to rabbinic tradition, there are [613\ncommandments](/wiki/613_mitzvot \"613 mitzvot\") in the Torah. Some of these\nlaws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly\ngroups, the [Kohanim](/wiki/Kohen \"Kohen\") and [Leviyim](/wiki/Levite\n\"Levite\") (members of the tribe of [Levi](/wiki/Levi \"Levi\")), some only to\nfarmers within the [Land of Israel](/wiki/Land_of_Israel \"Land of Israel\").\nMany laws were only applicable when the [Temple in\nJerusalem](/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem \"Temple in Jerusalem\") existed, and only\n369 of these commandments are still applicable today.[56]\n\nWhile there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written\ntext of the Torah alone (e.g., the [Sadducees](/wiki/Sadducees \"Sadducees\"),\nand the [Karaites](/wiki/Karaite_Judaism \"Karaite Judaism\")), most Jews\nbelieve in the [oral law](/wiki/Oral_law#Oral_law_in_Judaism \"Oral law\").\nThese oral traditions were transmitted by the [Pharisee](/wiki/Pharisees\n\"Pharisees\") school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in\nwritten form and expanded upon by the rabbis.\n\nAccording to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the\n[Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\")) and the [Oral law](/wiki/Oral_law \"Oral law\") to\nMoses on [Mount Sinai](/wiki/Biblical_Mount_Sinai \"Biblical Mount Sinai\"). The\nOral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him,\ntransmitted and taught to the sages ([rabbinic](/wiki/Rabbi \"Rabbi\") leaders)\nof each subsequent generation.\n\nFor centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in\nparallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral teachings might be\nforgotten, Rabbi [Judah haNasi](/wiki/Judah_haNasi \"Judah haNasi\") undertook\nthe mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which\nbecame known as the _Mishnah_.[57]\n\nThe Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law, which are the basis\nof the _Talmud._ According to [Abraham ben David](/wiki/Abraham_ben_David\n\"Abraham ben David\"), the _[Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah \"Mishnah\")_ was compiled by\nRabbi [Judah haNasi](/wiki/Judah_the_Prince \"Judah the Prince\") after the\ndestruction of Jerusalem, in [anno mundi](/wiki/Anno_mundi \"Anno mundi\") 3949,\nwhich corresponds to 189 CE.[58]\n\nOver the next four centuries, the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in\nboth of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and\n[Babylonia](/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Iraq \"History of the Jews in Iraq\")).\nThe commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into\nthe two [Talmuds](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\"), the Jerusalem Talmud (_Talmud\nYerushalmi_) and the Babylonian Talmud (_Talmud Bavli_). These have been\nfurther expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.\n\nIn the text of the Torah, many words are left undefined and many procedures\nare mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are\nsometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always\nbeen transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption\nthat the reader is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral,\nsources.[59]\n\nHalakha, the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading\nof the Torah, and the oral tradition—the Mishnah, the halakhic\n[Midrash](/wiki/Midrash \"Midrash\"), the Talmud and its commentaries. The\nHalakha has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature\nof questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as\n[responsa](/wiki/Responsa \"Responsa\") (in [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language\n\"Hebrew language\"), _Sheelot U-Teshuvot_.) Over time, as practices develop,\ncodes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa; the most\nimportant code, the [Shulchan Aruch](/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch \"Shulchan Aruch\"),\nlargely determines Orthodox religious practice today.\n\n### Jewish philosophy\n\nMain article: [Jewish philosophy](/wiki/Jewish_philosophy \"Jewish philosophy\")\n\nJewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of\nphilosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include [Solomon ibn\nGabirol](/wiki/Solomon_ibn_Gabirol \"Solomon ibn Gabirol\"), [Saadia\nGaon](/wiki/Saadia_Gaon \"Saadia Gaon\"), [Judah Halevi](/wiki/Judah_Halevi\n\"Judah Halevi\"), [Maimonides](/wiki/Maimonides \"Maimonides\"), and\n[Gersonides](/wiki/Gersonides \"Gersonides\"). Major changes occurred in\nresponse to the [Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment \"Age of\nEnlightenment\") (late 18th to early 19th century) leading to the post-\nEnlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both\nOrthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish\nphilosophers are [Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler](/wiki/Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler\n\"Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler\"), [Joseph B.\nSoloveitchik](/wiki/Joseph_B._Soloveitchik \"Joseph B. Soloveitchik\"), and\n[Yitzchok Hutner](/wiki/Yitzchok_Hutner \"Yitzchok Hutner\"). Well-known non-\nOrthodox Jewish philosophers include [Martin Buber](/wiki/Martin_Buber \"Martin\nBuber\"), [Franz Rosenzweig](/wiki/Franz_Rosenzweig \"Franz Rosenzweig\"),\n[Mordecai Kaplan](/wiki/Mordecai_Kaplan \"Mordecai Kaplan\"), [Abraham Joshua\nHeschel](/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel \"Abraham Joshua Heschel\"), [Will\nHerberg](/wiki/Will_Herberg \"Will Herberg\"), and [Emmanuel\nLévinas](/wiki/Emmanuel_L%C3%A9vinas \"Emmanuel Lévinas\").\n\n### Rabbinic hermeneutics\n\n13 Principles of Hermeneutics:\n\n  1. A law that operates under certain conditions will surely be operative in other situations where the same conditions are present in a more acute form\n  2. A law operating in one situation will also be operative in another situation if the text characterizes both situations in identical terms.\n  3. A law that clearly expresses the purpose it was meant to serve will also apply to other situations where the identical purpose may be served.\n  4. When a general rule is followed by illustrative particulars, only those particulars are to be embraced by it.\n  5. A law that begins with specifying particular cases, and then proceeds to an all-embracing generalization, is to be applied to particulars cases not specified but logically falling into the same generalization.\n  6. A law that begins with a generalization as to its intended applications, then continues with the specification of particular cases, and then concludes with a restatement of the generalization, can be applied only to the particular cases specified.\n  7. The rules about a generalization being followed or preceded by specifying particulars (rules 4 and 5) will not apply if it is apparent that the specification of the particular cases or the statement of the generalization is meant purely for achieving a greater clarity of language.\n  8. A particular case already covered in a generalization that is nevertheless treated separately suggests that the same particularized treatment be applied to all other cases which are covered in that generalization.\n  9. A penalty specified for a general category of wrongdoing is not to be automatically applied to a particular case that is withdrawn from the general rule to be specifically prohibited, but without any mention of the penalty.\n  10. A general prohibition followed by a specified penalty may be followed by a particular case, normally included in the generalization, with a modification in the penalty, either toward easing it or making it more severe.\n  11. A case logically falling into a general law but treated separately remains outside the provisions of the general law except in those instances where it is specifically included in them.\n  12. Obscurities in Biblical texts may be cleared up from the immediate context or from subsequently occurring passages\n  13. Contradictions in Biblical passages may be removed through the mediation of other passages.\n\n—[R. Ishmael](/wiki/Rabbi_Ishmael \"Rabbi Ishmael\")[60]\n\n[Orthodox](/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism \"Orthodox Judaism\") and many other\n[Jews](/wiki/Jews \"Jews\") do not believe that the revealed [Torah](/wiki/Torah\n\"Torah\") consists solely of its written contents, but of its interpretations\nas well. The study of [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") (in its widest sense, to\ninclude both poetry, narrative, and law, and both the [Hebrew\nBible](/wiki/Tanakh \"Tanakh\") and the [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\")) is in\nJudaism itself a sacred act of central importance. For the sages of the\n[Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah \"Mishnah\") and [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\"), and\nfor their successors today, the study of Torah was therefore not merely a\nmeans to learn the contents of God's revelation, but an end in itself.\nAccording to the [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\"),\n\n    These are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come; they are: honoring parents, loving deeds of kindness, and making peace between one person and another. But the study of the Torah is equal to them all. (Talmud Shabbat 127a).\n\nIn Judaism, \"the study of [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") can be a means of\nexperiencing God\".[61] Reflecting on the contribution of the\n[Amoraim](/wiki/Amoraim \"Amoraim\") and [Tanaim](/wiki/Tanaim \"Tanaim\") to\ncontemporary Judaism, Professor Jacob Neusner observed:\n\n    The rabbi's logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic-chopping. It is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of God to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world .... Here is the mystery of Talmudic Judaism: the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification.\"[62]\n\nTo study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus\nalso to study _how_ to study the word of God.\n\nIn the study of Torah, the sages formulated and followed various\n[logical](/wiki/Logic \"Logic\") and [hermeneutical](/wiki/Hermeneutics\n\"Hermeneutics\") principles. According to David Stern, all Rabbinic\nhermeneutics rest on two basic axioms:\n\n    first, the belief in the omni-significance of Scripture, in the meaningfulness of its every word, letter, even (according to one famous report) scribal flourish; second, the claim of the essential unity of Scripture as the expression of the single divine will.[63]\n\nThese two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations.\nAccording to the Talmud,\n\n    A single verse has several meanings, but no two verses hold the same meaning. It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael: 'Behold, My word is like fire—declares the Lord—and like a hammer that shatters rock' (Jer 23:29). Just as this hammer produces many sparks (when it strikes the rock), so a single verse has several meanings.\" (Talmud Sanhedrin 34a).\n\nObservant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic, because it contains within it a\nhost of interpretations[64]\n\nAccording to Rabbinic tradition, all valid interpretations of the [written\nTorah](/wiki/Written_Torah \"Written Torah\") were revealed to Moses at Sinai in\n[oral form](/wiki/Oral_Torah \"Oral Torah\"), and handed down from teacher to\npupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself).\nWhen different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes\nappealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis\nclaim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at\nSinai.[65]\n\nThus, [Hillel](/wiki/Hillel_the_Elder \"Hillel the Elder\") called attention to\nseven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws\n([baraita](/wiki/Baraita \"Baraita\") at the beginning of [Sifra](/wiki/Sifra\n\"Sifra\")); [R. Ishmael](/wiki/R._Ishmael \"R. Ishmael\"), thirteen (baraita at\nthe beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of\nHillel).[66] [Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili](/wiki/Eliezer_b._Jose_ha-Gelili\n\"Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili\") listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of\nnarrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the\n[Talmudim](/wiki/Talmudim \"Talmudim\") and [Midrashim](/wiki/Midrashim\n\"Midrashim\") have been collected by [Malbim](/wiki/Malbim \"Malbim\") in\n_Ayyelet ha-Shachar_ , the introduction to his commentary on the\n[Sifra](/wiki/Sifra \"Sifra\"). Nevertheless, R. Ishmael's 13 principles are\nperhaps the ones most widely known; they constitute an important, and one of\nJudaism's earliest, contributions to [logic](/wiki/Logic \"Logic\"),\n[hermeneutics](/wiki/Hermeneutics \"Hermeneutics\"), and\n[jurisprudence](/wiki/Jurisprudence \"Jurisprudence\").[67] [Judah\nHadassi](/wiki/Judah_Hadassi \"Judah Hadassi\") incorporated Ishmael's\nprinciples into [Karaite Judaism](/wiki/Karaite_Judaism \"Karaite Judaism\") in\nthe 12th century.[68] Today R. Ishmael's 13 principles are incorporated into\nthe Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily\nbasis.[69][70][71][72]\n\n## Jewish identity\n\n### Origin of the term \"Judaism\"\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Macedonian_Mezuzah.jpg/220px-\nMacedonian_Mezuzah.jpg)](/wiki/File:Macedonian_Mezuzah.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Macedonian_Mezuzah.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [mezuzah](/wiki/Mezuzah \"Mezuzah\") case\n\nThe term \"Judaism\" derives from _Iudaismus_ , a Latinized form of the Ancient\nGreek [Ioudaismos](/wiki/Ioudaismos \"Ioudaismos\") (Ἰουδαϊσμός) (from the verb\nἰουδαΐζειν, \"to side with or imitate the [Judeans]\"),[73] and it was\nultimately inspired by the [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\")\nיהודה, _Yehudah_ , \"[Judah](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah \"Kingdom of\nJudah\")\";[74][75] in Hebrew: יַהֲדוּת, _Yahadut_. The term _Ἰουδαϊσμός_ first\nappears in the [Hellenistic Greek](/wiki/Hellenistic_Greek \"Hellenistic\nGreek\") book of [2 Maccabees](/wiki/2_Maccabees \"2 Maccabees\") in the 2nd\ncentury BCE. In the context of the age and period it meant \"seeking or forming\npart of a cultural entity\"[76] and it resembled its antonym\n_[hellenismos](/wiki/Hellenismos \"Hellenismos\")_ , a word that signified a\npeople's submission to [Hellenic](/wiki/Hellenistic_period \"Hellenistic\nperiod\") ([Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greece \"Ancient Greece\")) cultural norms. The\nconflict between _iudaismos_ and _hellenismos_ lay behind the [Maccabean\nrevolt](/wiki/Maccabean_revolt \"Maccabean revolt\") and hence the invention of\nthe term _iudaismos_.[76]\n\n[Shaye J. D. Cohen](/wiki/Shaye_J._D._Cohen \"Shaye J. D. Cohen\") writes in his\nbook _The Beginnings of Jewishness_ :\n\n> We are tempted, of course, to translate [_Ioudaïsmós_] as \"Judaism,\" but\n> this translation is too narrow, because in this first occurrence of the\n> term, _Ioudaïsmós_ has not yet been reduced to the designation of a\n> religion. It means rather \"the aggregate of all those characteristics that\n> makes Judaeans Judaean (or Jews Jewish).\" Among these characteristics, to be\n> sure, are practices and beliefs that we would today call \"religious,\" but\n> these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term. Thus\n> _Ioudaïsmós_ should be translated not as \"Judaism\" but as Judaeanness.[77]\n\nThe earliest instance in Europe where the term was used to mean \"the\nprofession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or polity\nof the Jews\"[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] is Robert Fabyan's _The newe cronycles of\nEnglande and of Fraunce a 1513_. \"Judaism\" as a direct translation of the\nLatin _Iudaismus_ first occurred in a 1611 English translation of the\n[apocrypha](/wiki/Biblical_apocrypha \"Biblical apocrypha\")\n([Deuterocanon](/wiki/Deuterocanon \"Deuterocanon\") in\n[Catholic](/wiki/Catholic \"Catholic\") and [Eastern\nOrthodoxy](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church \"Eastern Orthodox Church\")), 2 Macc.\nii. 21: \"Those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for\nIudaisme.\"[78]\n\n### Distinction between Jews as a people and Judaism\n\nAccording to [Daniel Boyarin](/wiki/Daniel_Boyarin \"Daniel Boyarin\"), the\nunderlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism\nitself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its\norigin in [Platonic](/wiki/Plato \"Plato\") philosophy and that permeated\n[Hellenistic Judaism](/wiki/Hellenistic_Judaism \"Hellenistic Judaism\").[79]\nConsequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional\nWestern categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests\nthat this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than\n3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside\nthe West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During\nthis time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government,\nconquest, occupation, and exile. In the Diaspora, they were in contact with,\nand influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic\ncultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see\n[Haskalah](/wiki/Haskalah \"Haskalah\")) and the rise of nationalism, which\nwould bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the\n[Land of Israel](/wiki/Land_of_Israel \"Land of Israel\"). They also saw an\nelite population convert to Judaism (the [Khazars](/wiki/Khazar \"Khazar\")),\nonly to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that\nelite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Thus,\nBoyarin has argued that \"Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity,\nbecause it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these,\nin dialectical tension.\"[80]\n\nIn contrast to this point of view, practices such as [Humanistic\nJudaism](/wiki/Humanistic_Judaism \"Humanistic Judaism\") reject the religious\naspects of Judaism, while retaining certain cultural traditions.\n\n### Who is a Jew?\n\nMain article: [Who is a Jew?](/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F \"Who is a Jew?\")\n\nAccording to [Rabbinic Judaism](/wiki/Rabbinic_Judaism \"Rabbinic Judaism\"), a\nJew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who [converted to\nJudaism](/wiki/Conversion_to_Judaism \"Conversion to Judaism\") in accordance\nwith Jewish Law. [Reconstructionist Judaism](/wiki/Reconstructionist_Judaism\n\"Reconstructionist Judaism\") and the larger denominations of worldwide\n[Progressive Judaism](/wiki/Reform_Judaism \"Reform Judaism\") (also known as\nLiberal or Reform Judaism) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is\nJewish, if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity, but not the\nsmaller regional branches.[_[clarification\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_] All\nmainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, although\nconversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud.\nThe conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is\nexamined on his or her sincerity and knowledge.[81] Converts are called \"ben\nAbraham\" or \"bat Abraham\", (son or daughter of Abraham). Conversions have on\noccasion been overturned. In 2008, Israel's highest religious court\ninvalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant\nfamilies, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.[82]\n\nRabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a\nJew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another\nreligion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. According to\nsome sources, the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted\nto another religion is no longer a Jew,[83][84] and the Israeli Government has\nalso taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes.[85] However,\nthe Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried, and\ndifferent situations call for consideration and differing actions. For\nexample, Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to\nJudaism \"without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the\nJewish community\" and \"A proselyte who has become an apostate remains,\nnevertheless, a Jew\".[86]\n\n[Karaite Judaism](/wiki/Karaite_Judaism \"Karaite Judaism\") believes that\nJewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. Although a\nminority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both\nparents be Jewish, and not only the father. They argue that only patrilineal\ndescent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the\nTorah went according to the male line.[87]\n\nThe question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was\ngiven new impetus when, in the 1950s, [David Ben-Gurion](/wiki/David_Ben-\nGurion \"David Ben-Gurion\") requested opinions on _mihu Yehudi_ (\"Who is a\nJew\") from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order\nto settle citizenship questions. This is still not settled, and occasionally\nresurfaces in [Israeli politics](/wiki/Politics_of_Israel \"Politics of\nIsrael\").\n\nHistorical definitions of [Jewish identity](/wiki/Jewish_identity \"Jewish\nidentity\") have traditionally been based on _[halakhic](/wiki/Halakha\n\"Halakha\")_ definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions.\nHistorical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the\n[Oral Torah](/wiki/Oral_Torah \"Oral Torah\") into the [Babylonian\nTalmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\"), around 200 [CE](/wiki/Common_Era \"Common\nEra\"). Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as\n[Deuteronomy](/wiki/Book_of_Deuteronomy \"Book of Deuteronomy\") 7:1–5, by\nJewish sages, are used as a warning against\n[intermarriage](/wiki/Interfaith_marriage_in_Judaism \"Interfaith marriage in\nJudaism\") between Jews and [Canaanites](/wiki/Canaanites \"Canaanites\") because\n\"[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they\nwill worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others.\" [Leviticus\n24:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+24%3A10&version=NRSV)\nsays that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an\n[Egyptian](/wiki/Egyptians \"Egyptians\") man is \"of the community of Israel.\"\nThis is complemented by [Ezra\n10:2–3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+10%3A2%E2%80%933&version=NRSV),\nwhere Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their\n[gentile](/wiki/Gentile \"Gentile\") wives and their children.[88][89] A popular\ntheory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of\nJewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars\nchallenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the\npre-exile period.[90][91] Since the anti-religious _[Haskalah](/wiki/Haskalah\n\"Haskalah\")_ movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, _halakhic_\ninterpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.[92]\n\n### Jewish demographics\n\nMain article: [Jewish population by\ncountry](/wiki/Jewish_population_by_country \"Jewish population by country\")\n\nThe total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the\ndefinition of \"who is a Jew\" is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves\nas Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other\nJews. According to the _Jewish Year Book_ (1901), the global Jewish population\nin 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World\nJewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002,\naccording to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3 million Jews around\nthe world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6 million. Jewish population\ngrowth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001.\n\n## Jewish religious movements\n\nMain article: [Jewish religious movements](/wiki/Jewish_religious_movements\n\"Jewish religious movements\")\n\n### Rabbinic Judaism\n\nRabbinic Judaism (or in some Christian traditions, Rabbinism) (Hebrew:\n\"Yahadut Rabanit\" – יהדות רבנית) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since\nthe 6th century CE, after the codification of the [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud\n\"Talmud\"). It is characterised by the belief that the [Written\nTorah](/wiki/Written_Torah \"Written Torah\") (Written Law) cannot be correctly\ninterpreted without reference to the [Oral Torah](/wiki/Oral_Torah \"Oral\nTorah\") and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned\nby the [Law](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\").\n\nThe [Jewish Enlightenment](/wiki/Jewish_Enlightenment \"Jewish Enlightenment\")\nof the late 18th century resulted in the division of\n[Ashkenazi](/wiki/Ashkenazi \"Ashkenazi\") (Western) Jewry into religious\nmovements or denominations, especially in North America and Anglophone\ncountries. The main denominations today outside Israel (where the situation is\nrather different) are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.\n\n  * [Orthodox Judaism](/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism \"Orthodox Judaism\") holds that both the Written and [Oral Torah](/wiki/Oral_Torah \"Oral Torah\") were divinely revealed to [Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\") and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging. Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the _[Shulchan Aruch](/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch \"Shulchan Aruch\")_ (a condensed codification of halakha that largely favored Sephardic traditions) to be the definitive codification of Jewish law. Orthodoxy places a high importance on [Maimonides' 13 principles](/wiki/13_Principles_of_Faith \"13 Principles of Faith\") as a definition of Jewish faith.\n\n    \n\n  * Orthodoxy is often divided into [Modern Orthodox Judaism](/wiki/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism \"Modern Orthodox Judaism\") and [Haredi Judaism](/wiki/Haredi_Judaism \"Haredi Judaism\"). [Haredi Judaism](/wiki/Haredi_Judaism \"Haredi Judaism\") is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines, and it may be distinguished from [Modern Orthodox Judaism](/wiki/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism \"Modern Orthodox Judaism\") in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices. Subsets of [Haredi Judaism](/wiki/Haredi_Judaism \"Haredi Judaism\") include [Hasidic Judaism](/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism \"Hasidic Judaism\"), which is rooted in the [Kabbalah](/wiki/Kabbalah \"Kabbalah\") and distinguished by reliance on a [Rebbe](/wiki/Rebbe \"Rebbe\") or religious teacher; and [Sephardic Haredi](/wiki/Sephardic_Haredi \"Sephardic Haredi\") Judaism, which emerged among [Sephardic](/wiki/Sephardic \"Sephardic\") (Asian and North African) Jews in Israel.\n\n  * [Conservative Judaism](/wiki/Conservative_Judaism \"Conservative Judaism\") is characterized by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs, including observance of [Shabbat](/wiki/Shabbat \"Shabbat\") and [kashrut](/wiki/Kashrut \"Kashrut\"), a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, a positive attitude toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses.[93][94] Conservative Judaism holds that the [Oral Law](/wiki/Oral_Torah \"Oral Torah\") is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.\n  * [Reform Judaism](/wiki/Reform_Judaism \"Reform Judaism\"), called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries, defines Judaism in relatively universalist terms, rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") while observing moral laws, and emphasizes the ethical call of the [Prophets](/wiki/Nevi%27im \"Nevi'im\"). Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular (along with [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\") in many cases) and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/ReformJewishService.jpg/230px-\nReformJewishService.jpg)](/wiki/File:ReformJewishService.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ReformJewishService.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [Reform synagogue](/wiki/Reform_Judaism \"Reform Judaism\") with mixed seating\nand equal participation of men and women\n\n  * [Reconstructionist Judaism](/wiki/Reconstructionist_Judaism \"Reconstructionist Judaism\"), like Reform Judaism, does not hold that Jewish law, as such, requires observance, but unlike Reform, Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow.\n  * [Jewish Renewal](/wiki/Jewish_Renewal \"Jewish Renewal\") is a recent North American movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice but does not address issues of Jewish law. Men and women participate equally in prayer.\n  * [Humanistic Judaism](/wiki/Humanistic_Judaism \"Humanistic Judaism\") is a small non-theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity.\n\n#### Sephardi and Mizrahi Judaism\n\nWhile [traditions and customs](/wiki/Minhag \"Minhag\") (see also \"[Sephardic\nlaw and customs](/wiki/Sephardic_law_and_customs \"Sephardic law and\ncustoms\")\") vary between discrete communities, it can be said that\n[Sephardi](/wiki/Sephardi \"Sephardi\") and [Mizrahi](/wiki/Mizrahi \"Mizrahi\")\nJewish communities do not generally adhere to the \"movement\" framework popular\nin and among [Ashkenazi](/wiki/Ashkenazi \"Ashkenazi\") Jewry.[95] Historically,\nSephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a\n\"big tent\" approach.[96] This is particularly the case in contemporary\n[Israel](/wiki/State_of_israel \"State of israel\"), which is home to the\nlargest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world. (However,\nindividual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews may be members of or attend synagogues\nthat do adhere to one Ashkenazi-inflected movement or another.)\n\nSephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the conservative, and\n[prayer rites](/wiki/Nusach#Sephardi_and_Mizrachi_nuschaot \"Nusach\") are\nreflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since\ntheir respective inception. Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a\nparticular rabbi or school of thought; for example, the Sephardic [Chief Rabbi\nof Israel](/wiki/Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel \"Chief Rabbinate of Israel\").\n\n#### Jewish movements in Israel\n\nMain article: [Religion in Israel](/wiki/Religion_in_Israel \"Religion in\nIsrael\")\n\nMost Jewish Israelis classify themselves as \"secular\" (_hiloni_),\n[\"traditional\" (_masorti_)](/wiki/Masortim \"Masortim\"), \"religious\" (_dati_)\nor _[Haredi](/wiki/Haredi_Judaism \"Haredi Judaism\")_. The term \"secular\" is\nmore popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western\n(European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their\nlives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief\nand practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized\nreligious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the\nliberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).\n\nThe term \"traditional\" (_masorti_) is most common as a self-description among\nIsraeli families of \"eastern\" origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and\nNorth Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with the\n[Conservative Judaism](/wiki/Conservative_Judaism \"Conservative Judaism\"),\nwhich also names itself \"Masorti\" outside North America. There is a great deal\nof ambiguity in the ways \"secular\" and \"traditional\" are used in Israel: they\noften overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview\nand practical religious observance. The term \"Orthodox\" is not popular in\nIsraeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that\ncategory is far greater than in the [diaspora](/wiki/Jewish_Diaspora \"Jewish\nDiaspora\"). What would be called \"Orthodox\" in the diaspora includes what is\ncommonly called _dati_ (religious) or _haredi_ (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The\nformer term includes what is called \"[Religious\nZionism](/wiki/Religious_Zionism \"Religious Zionism\")\" or the \"National\nReligious\" community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or\nso as _haredi-leumi_ ([nationalist](/wiki/Nationalism \"Nationalism\")\n_haredi_), or \"Hardal\", which combines a largely _haredi_ lifestyle with\nnationalist ideology. (Some people, in [Yiddish](/wiki/Yiddish \"Yiddish\"),\nalso refer to observant Orthodox Jews as _frum_ , as opposed to _frei_ (more\nliberal Jews)).\n\n_Haredi_ applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate\ngroups along both ethnic and ideological lines: (1) \"Lithuanian\" (non-hasidic)\n_haredim_ of [Ashkenazic](/wiki/Ashkenazim \"Ashkenazim\") origin; (2) Hasidic\n_haredim_ of Ashkenazic origin; and (3) [Sephardic](/wiki/Sephardim\n\"Sephardim\") _haredim_.\n\n### Karaites and Samaritans\n\n[Karaite Judaism](/wiki/Karaite_Judaism \"Karaite Judaism\") defines itself as\nthe remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the [Second\nTemple](/wiki/Second_Temple \"Second Temple\") period, such as the\n[Sadducees](/wiki/Sadducees \"Sadducees\"). The Karaites (\"Scripturalists\")\naccept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the [Peshat](/wiki/Peshat\n\"Peshat\") (\"simple\" meaning); they do not accept non-biblical writings as\nauthoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the\nJewish community at all, although most do.\n\nThe [Samaritans](/wiki/Samaritan \"Samaritan\"), a very small community located\nentirely around [Mount Gerizim](/wiki/Mount_Gerizim \"Mount Gerizim\") in the\n[Nablus](/wiki/Nablus \"Nablus\")/[Shechem](/wiki/Shechem \"Shechem\") region of\nthe [West Bank](/wiki/West_Bank \"West Bank\") and in [Holon](/wiki/Holon\n\"Holon\"), near [Tel Aviv](/wiki/Tel_Aviv \"Tel Aviv\") in Israel, regard\nthemselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age [kingdom of\nIsrael](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_\\(Samaria\\) \"Kingdom of Israel \\(Samaria\\)\").\nTheir religious practices are based on the literal text of the written\n[Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") (Five Books of Moses), which they view as the\nonly authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the [Samaritan\nBook of Joshua](/wiki/Book_of_Joshua_\\(Samaritan\\) \"Book of Joshua\n\\(Samaritan\\)\")).\n\n### Haymanot (Ethiopian Judaism)\n\n_See also:[Haymanot](/wiki/Haymanot \"Haymanot\"); [Beta\nIsrael](/wiki/Beta_Israel \"Beta Israel\")._\n\nHaymanot (meaning \"religion\" in Ge'ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism\npracticed by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially\nfrom Rabbinic, Karaite, and Samaritan Judaisms, Ethiopian Jews having diverged\nfrom their coreligionists earlier. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in\nGe'ez, not Hebrew, and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the\nOrit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ,\nwith some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and\nsome additional holidays, like [Sigd](/wiki/Sigd \"Sigd\").\n\n## Jewish observances\n\n### Jewish ethics\n\nMain article: [Jewish ethics](/wiki/Jewish_ethics \"Jewish ethics\")\n\nJewish ethics may be guided by [halakhic](/wiki/Halakhic \"Halakhic\")\ntraditions, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish\nethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as\njustice, truth, peace, loving-kindness ([chesed](/wiki/Chesed \"Chesed\")),\ncompassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish ethical practices\ninclude practices of charity ([tzedakah](/wiki/Tzedakah \"Tzedakah\")) and\nrefraining from negative speech ([lashon hara](/wiki/Lashon_hara \"Lashon\nhara\")). Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues\nare subjects of dispute among Jews.\n\n### Prayers\n\nMain article: [Jewish services](/wiki/Jewish_services \"Jewish services\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/YemeniJew1914.jpg/200px-\nYemeniJew1914.jpg)](/wiki/File:YemeniJew1914.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:YemeniJew1914.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA Yemenite Jew at morning prayers, wearing a [kippah](/wiki/Kippah \"Kippah\")\nskullcap, prayer shawl and [tefillin](/wiki/Tefillin \"Tefillin\")\n\nTraditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily,\n[Shacharit](/wiki/Shacharit \"Shacharit\"), [Mincha](/wiki/Mincha \"Mincha\"), and\n[Ma'ariv](/wiki/Ma%27ariv \"Ma'ariv\") with a fourth prayer,\n[Mussaf](/wiki/Mussaf \"Mussaf\") added on [Shabbat](/wiki/Shabbat \"Shabbat\")\nand [holidays](/wiki/Jewish_holiday \"Jewish holiday\"). At the heart of each\nservice is the _[Amidah](/wiki/Amidah \"Amidah\")_ or _Shemoneh Esrei_. Another\nkey prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the _[Shema\nYisrael](/wiki/Shema_Yisrael \"Shema Yisrael\")_ (or _Shema_). The _Shema_ is\nthe recitation of a verse from the Torah ([Deuteronomy](/wiki/Deuteronomy\n\"Deuteronomy\") 6:4): _Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad_ —\"Hear, O\nIsrael! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!\"\n\nMost of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary\nprayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a\n[quorum](/wiki/Quorum \"Quorum\") of ten adult Jews, called a\n_[minyan](/wiki/Minyan \"Minyan\")_. In nearly all Orthodox and a few\nConservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a _minyan_ ; most\nConservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews\nas well.\n\nIn addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite [prayers and\nbenedictions](/wiki/List_of_Jewish_prayers_and_blessings \"List of Jewish\nprayers and blessings\") throughout the day when [performing various\nacts](/wiki/List_of_Jewish_prayers_and_blessings#Everyday_prayers_and_blessings\n\"List of Jewish prayers and blessings\"). Prayers are recited upon [waking up\nin the morning](/wiki/Modeh_ani \"Modeh ani\"), before eating or drinking\ndifferent foods, [after eating a meal](/wiki/Birkat_Hamazon \"Birkat Hamazon\"),\nand so on.\n\nThe approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can\ninclude the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers\nrecited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral\nmusic, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages\nor the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere\nmost closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are\nmore likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their\nservices. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and\nReconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an\n[equal basis](/wiki/Egalitarianism \"Egalitarianism\") with men, including roles\ntraditionally filled only by men, such as [reading from the\nTorah](/wiki/Torah_reading \"Torah reading\"). In addition, many Reform temples\nuse musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.\n\n### Religious clothing\n\nFurther information: [kippah](/wiki/Kippah \"Kippah\"), [tzitzit](/wiki/Tzitzit\n\"Tzitzit\"), and [tefillin](/wiki/Tefillin \"Tefillin\")\n\nA _[kippah](/wiki/Kippah \"Kippah\")_ (Hebrew: כִּפָּה, plural _kippot_ ;\nYiddish: יאַרמלקע, _yarmulke_) is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by\nmany Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish\nreligious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities,\nonly men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear\nkippot. _Kippot_ range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the\nback of the head to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.\n\n_[Tzitzit](/wiki/Tzitzit \"Tzitzit\")_ (Hebrew: צִיציִת) ([Ashkenazi\npronunciation](/wiki/Ashkenazi_Hebrew \"Ashkenazi Hebrew\"): _tzitzis_) are\nspecial knotted \"fringes\" or \"tassels\" found on the four corners of the\n_[tallit](/wiki/Tallit \"Tallit\")_ (Hebrew: טַלִּית) (Ashkenazi pronunciation:\n_tallis_), or prayer [shawl](/wiki/Shawl \"Shawl\"). The _tallit_ is worn by\nJewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary\nregarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys\nwear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities, it is\ncustomary to wear one only after marriage. A _tallit katan_ (small tallit) is\na fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox\ncircles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.\n\n[Tefillin](/wiki/Tefillin \"Tefillin\") (Hebrew: תְפִלִּין), known in English as\nphylacteries (from the Greek word φυλακτήριον, meaning _safeguard_ or\n_amulet_), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached\nto the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn\nduring weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish\nwomen.[97]\n\nA _[kittel](/wiki/Kittel \"Kittel\")_ (Yiddish: קיטל), a white knee-length\novergarment, is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on\nthe [High Holidays](/wiki/High_Holidays \"High Holidays\"). It is traditional\nfor the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some\ncommunities, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males\nare buried in a _tallit_ and sometimes also a _kittel_ which are part of the\n_[tachrichim](/wiki/Tachrichim \"Tachrichim\")_ (burial garments).\n\n### Jewish holidays\n\nMain article: [Jewish holiday](/wiki/Jewish_holiday \"Jewish holiday\")\n\nJewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar, which celebrate\nmoments in Jewish history, as well as central themes in the relationship\nbetween God and the world, such as [creation](/wiki/Creation_myth \"Creation\nmyth\"), [revelation](/wiki/Revelation \"Revelation\"), and\n[redemption](/wiki/Salvation \"Salvation\").\n\n#### Shabbat\n\nMain article: [Shabbat](/wiki/Shabbat \"Shabbat\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Shabbat_Challos.jpg/250px-\nShabbat_Challos.jpg)](/wiki/File:Shabbat_Challos.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Shabbat_Challos.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTwo braided Shabbat [challahs](/wiki/Challah \"Challah\") placed under an\nembroidered [challah cover](/wiki/Challah_cover \"Challah cover\") at the start\nof the Shabbat meal\n\n_[Shabbat](/wiki/Shabbat \"Shabbat\")_ , the weekly day of rest lasting from\nshortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night,\ncommemorates God's day of rest after six days of creation.[98] It plays a\npivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious\nlaw. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by\nlighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins\nwith the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi,\na blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have\n[challah](/wiki/Challah \"Challah\"), two braided loaves of bread, on the table.\nDuring Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under\n[39 categories of\n_melakhah_](/wiki/39_categories_of_activity_prohibited_on_Shabbat \"39\ncategories of activity prohibited on Shabbat\"), translated literally as\n\"work\". In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not \"work\" in the\nusual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using\nmoney and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire\nhas been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning\nfuel and using electricity.\n\n#### Three pilgrimage festivals\n\nMain article: [Shalosh regalim](/wiki/Shalosh_regalim \"Shalosh regalim\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Jerusalemsukkas.jpg/250px-\nJerusalemsukkas.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jerusalemsukkas.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jerusalemsukkas.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSome [sukkot](/wiki/Sukkah \"Sukkah\") in Jerusalem\n\nJewish holy days (_chaggim_), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history,\nsuch as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark\nthe change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three\nmajor festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called \"regalim\" (derived\nfrom the Hebrew word \"regel\", or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary\nfor the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the\nTemple.\n\n  * [Passover](/wiki/Passover \"Passover\") (_Pesach_) is a week-long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of [Nisan](/wiki/Nisan \"Nisan\") (the first month in the Hebrew calendar), that commemorates the [Exodus](/wiki/Book_of_Exodus \"Book of Exodus\") from Egypt. Outside Israel, Passover is celebrated for eight days. In ancient times, it coincided with the barley harvest. It is the only holiday that centers on home-service, the [Seder](/wiki/Passover_Seder \"Passover Seder\"). [Leavened](/wiki/Leavening_agent \"Leavening agent\") products ([chametz](/wiki/Chametz \"Chametz\")) are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week. Homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by-products remain, and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder. [Matzo](/wiki/Matzo \"Matzo\") is eaten instead of bread.\n  * [Shavuot](/wiki/Shavuot \"Shavuot\") (\"Pentecost\" or \"Feast of Weeks\") celebrates the revelation of the [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") to the [Israelites](/wiki/Israelite \"Israelite\") on Mount Sinai. Also known as the Festival of Bikurim, or first fruits, it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest. Shavuot customs include all-night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot, eating dairy foods (cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites), reading the Book of Ruth, decorating homes and synagogues with greenery, and wearing white clothing, symbolizing purity.\n  * [Sukkot](/wiki/Sukkot \"Sukkot\") (\"Tabernacles\" or \"The Festival of Booths\") commemorates the Israelites' forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land. It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called _sukkot_ (sing. _[sukkah](/wiki/Sukkah \"Sukkah\")_) that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering. It coincides with the fruit harvest and marks the end of the agricultural cycle. Jews around the world eat in _sukkot_ for seven days and nights. Sukkot concludes with [Shemini Atzeret](/wiki/Shemini_Atzeret \"Shemini Atzeret\"), where Jews begin to pray for rain and [Simchat Torah](/wiki/Simchat_Torah \"Simchat Torah\"), \"Rejoicing of the Torah\", a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again. The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls. Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are technically considered to be a separate holiday and not a part of Sukkot.\n\n#### High Holy Days\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Maurycy_Gottlieb_-\n_Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg/200px-Maurycy_Gottlieb_-\n_Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg)](/wiki/File:Maurycy_Gottlieb_-\n_Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Maurycy_Gottlieb_-\n_Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[Yom Kippur](/wiki/Yom_Kippur \"Yom Kippur\")_ by [Maurycy\nGottlieb](/wiki/Maurycy_Gottlieb \"Maurycy Gottlieb\") (1878)\n\nMain article: [High Holidays](/wiki/High_Holidays \"High Holidays\")\n\nThe High Holidays (_Yamim Noraim_ or \"Days of Awe\") revolve around judgment\nand forgiveness.\n\n  * [Rosh Hashanah](/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah \"Rosh Hashanah\"), (also _Yom Ha-Zikkaron_ or \"Day of Remembrance\", and _Yom Teruah_ , or \"Day of the Sounding of the [Shofar](/wiki/Shofar \"Shofar\")\"). Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year (literally, \"head of the year\"), although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the [Hebrew calendar](/wiki/Hebrew_calendar \"Hebrew calendar\"), [Tishri](/wiki/Tishri \"Tishri\"). Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10-day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur, during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed, intentionally or not, throughout the year. Holiday customs include blowing the shofar, or ram's horn, in the synagogue, eating apples and honey, and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods, such as pomegranates.\n  * [Yom Kippur](/wiki/Yom_Kippur \"Yom Kippur\"), (\"Day of Atonement\") is the holiest day of the Jewish year. It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one's sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a \"Machzor\". Many non-religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the \"seuda mafseket\", is eaten. Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called \"Ne'ilah\", ends with a long blast of the shofar.\n\n#### Purim\n\nMain article: [Purim](/wiki/Purim \"Purim\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Jerusalem_Purim_street_scene.jpg/220px-\nJerusalem_Purim_street_scene.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jerusalem_Purim_street_scene.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jerusalem_Purim_street_scene.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPurim street scene in Jerusalem\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Pr%C3%A9sentation_de_la_Loi%2C_Edouard_Moyse_%281860%29_-_Mus%C3%A9e_d%27art_et_d%27histoire_du_Juda%C3%AFsme.jpg/200px-\nPr%C3%A9sentation_de_la_Loi%2C_Edouard_Moyse_%281860%29_-_Mus%C3%A9e_d%27art_et_d%27histoire_du_Juda%C3%AFsme.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pr%C3%A9sentation_de_la_Loi,_Edouard_Moyse_\\(1860\\)_-_Mus%C3%A9e_d%27art_et_d%27histoire_du_Juda%C3%AFsme.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pr%C3%A9sentation_de_la_Loi,_Edouard_Moyse_\\(1860\\)_-_Mus%C3%A9e_d%27art_et_d%27histoire_du_Juda%C3%AFsme.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") reading, France, 1860 [Museum of Jewish Art and\nHistory](/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_d%27Art_et_d%27Histoire_du_Juda%C3%AFsme \"Musée\nd'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme\")\n\n[Purim](/wiki/Purim \"Purim\") ([Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew\nlanguage\"): [![About this\nsound](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-\nLoudspeaker.svg.png)](/wiki/File:He-Purim.ogg \"About this sound\")\n[פורים](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/He-Purim.ogg \"He-\nPurim.ogg\") ([help](/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_help \"Wikipedia:Media\nhelp\")·[info](/wiki/File:He-Purim.ogg \"File:He-Purim.ogg\")) _Pûrîm_\n\"[lots](/wiki/Cleromancy \"Cleromancy\")\") is a joyous Jewish holiday that\ncommemorates the deliverance of the [Persian Jews](/wiki/Persian_Jews \"Persian\nJews\") from the plot of the evil [Haman](/wiki/Haman_\\(Bible\\) \"Haman\n\\(Bible\\)\"), who sought to [exterminate](/wiki/Genocide \"Genocide\") them, as\nrecorded in the biblical [Book of Esther](/wiki/Book_of_Esther \"Book of\nEsther\"). It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther,\nmutual gifts of food and drink, [charity](/wiki/Alms \"Alms\") to the poor, and\na celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating\nspecial pastries called [hamantashen](/wiki/Hamantash \"Hamantash\"), dressing\nup in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.\n\nPurim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of\n[Adar](/wiki/Adar \"Adar\"), which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian\ncalendar.\n\n#### Hanukkah\n\nMain article: [Hanukkah](/wiki/Hanukkah \"Hanukkah\")\n\n[Hanukkah](/wiki/Hanukkah \"Hanukkah\") ([Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew\nlanguage\"): חֲנֻכָּה‎, \"dedication\") also known as the Festival of Lights, is\nan eight-day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of\n[Kislev](/wiki/Kislev \"Kislev\") ([Hebrew calendar](/wiki/Hebrew_calendar\n\"Hebrew calendar\")). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling\nof lights on each of the festival's eight nights, one on the first night, two\non the second night and so on.\n\nThe holiday was called Hanukkah (meaning \"dedication\") because it marks the\nre-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by [Antiochus IV\nEpiphanes](/wiki/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes \"Antiochus IV Epiphanes\").\nSpiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the \"Miracle of the Oil\". According to the\nTalmud, at the re-dedication of the [Temple in\nJerusalem](/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem \"Temple in Jerusalem\") following the\nvictory of the [Maccabees](/wiki/Maccabees \"Maccabees\") over the [Seleucid\nEmpire](/wiki/Seleucid_Empire \"Seleucid Empire\"), there was only enough\nconsecrated [oil](/wiki/Oil \"Oil\") to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for\none day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days – which was the length of\ntime it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.\n\nHanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major\nholiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated\nin modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and\nhas national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the\nestablishment of the State of Israel.\n\n#### Fast days\n\nMain articles: [Tisha B'Av](/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av \"Tisha B'Av\"), [Seventeenth of\nTamuz](/wiki/Seventeenth_of_Tamuz \"Seventeenth of Tamuz\"), [10th of\nTevet](/wiki/10th_of_Tevet \"10th of Tevet\"), and [Tzom\nGedaliah](/wiki/Tzom_Gedaliah \"Tzom Gedaliah\")\n\n[Tisha B'Av](/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av \"Tisha B'Av\") ([Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language\n\"Hebrew language\"): תשעה באב‎ or ט׳ באב, \"the Ninth of [Av](/wiki/Av_\\(month\\)\n\"Av \\(month\\)\")\") is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the\ndestruction of the [First](/wiki/First_Temple \"First Temple\") and [Second\nTemples](/wiki/Second_Temple \"Second Temple\"), and in later times, the\n[expulsion of the Jews from Spain](/wiki/Alhambra_Decree \"Alhambra Decree\").\n\nThere are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of\nthe destruction of the Temples.

The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples.\nSome traditional features of a synagogue are:\n\n  * The [ark](/wiki/Ark_\\(synagogue\\) \"Ark \\(synagogue\\)\") (called _aron ha-kodesh_ by [Ashkenazim](/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews \"Ashkenazi Jews\") and _hekhal_ by [Sephardim](/wiki/Sephardi_Jews \"Sephardi Jews\")) where the [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") scrolls are kept (the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain (_[parochet](/wiki/Parochet \"Parochet\")_) outside or inside the ark doors);\n  * The elevated reader's platform (called _[bimah](/wiki/Bema#Judaism \"Bema\")_ by Ashkenazim and _tebah_ by Sephardim), where the Torah is read (and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues);\n  * The [eternal light](/wiki/Sanctuary_lamp \"Sanctuary lamp\") (_ner tamid_), a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit [menorah](/wiki/Menorah_\\(Temple\\) \"Menorah \\(Temple\\)\") of the [Temple in Jerusalem](/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem \"Temple in Jerusalem\")\n  * The pulpit, or _amud_ , a lectern facing the Ark where the [hazzan](/wiki/Hazzan \"Hazzan\") or prayer leader stands while praying.\n\nIn addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include\n[yeshivas](/wiki/Yeshiva \"Yeshiva\"), or institutions of Jewish learning, and\n[mikvahs](/wiki/Mikvah \"Mikvah\"), which are ritual baths.\n\n### Dietary laws: _kashrut_\n\nMain article: [Kashrut](/wiki/Kashrut \"Kashrut\")\n\nThe Jewish dietary laws are known as _[kashrut](/wiki/Kashrut \"Kashrut\")_.\nFood prepared in accordance with them is termed [kosher](/wiki/Kosher_foods\n\"Kosher foods\"), and food that is not kosher is also known as _treifah_ or\n_treif_. People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be \"keeping\nkosher\".[99]\n\nMany of the laws apply to animal-based foods. For example, in order to be\nconsidered kosher, [mammals](/wiki/Mammals \"Mammals\") must have split\n[hooves](/wiki/Hooves \"Hooves\") and [chew their cud](/wiki/Ruminants\n\"Ruminants\"). The [pig](/wiki/Pig \"Pig\") is arguably the most well-known\nexample of a non-kosher animal.[100] Although it has split hooves, it does not\nchew its cud.[101] For [seafood](/wiki/Seafood \"Seafood\") to be kosher, the\nanimal must have [fins](/wiki/Fins \"Fins\") and\n[scales](/wiki/Scale_\\(zoology\\) \"Scale \\(zoology\\)\"). Certain types of\nseafood, such as [shellfish](/wiki/Shellfish \"Shellfish\"),\n[crustaceans](/wiki/Crustaceans \"Crustaceans\"), and [eels](/wiki/Eel \"Eel\"),\nare therefore considered non-kosher. Concerning birds, a list of non-kosher\nspecies is given in the [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\"). The exact\n[translations](/wiki/Translations \"Translations\") of many of the species have\nnot survived, and some non-kosher birds' identities are no longer certain.\nHowever, [traditions](/wiki/Traditions \"Traditions\") exist about the _kashrut_\nstatus of a few birds. For example, both [chickens](/wiki/Chickens \"Chickens\")\nand [turkeys](/wiki/Turkeys \"Turkeys\") are permitted in most communities.\nOther types of animals, such as [amphibians](/wiki/Amphibians \"Amphibians\"),\n[reptiles](/wiki/Reptiles \"Reptiles\"), and most [insects](/wiki/Insects\n\"Insects\"), are prohibited altogether.[99]\n\nIn addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and\npoultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a\nprocess known as _[shechitah](/wiki/Shechitah \"Shechitah\")_. Without the\nproper [slaughtering](/wiki/Animal_slaughter \"Animal slaughter\") practices\neven an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered _treif_. The slaughtering\nprocess is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal.\nForbidden parts of animals include the [blood](/wiki/Blood \"Blood\"), some\n[fats](/wiki/Fat \"Fat\"), and the area in and around the [sciatic\nnerve](/wiki/Sciatic_nerve \"Sciatic nerve\").[99]\n\nJewish law also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together.\nThe waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in\nwhich they are consumed and by community, and can extend for up to six hours.\nBased on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother's milk,\nthis rule is mostly derived from the [Oral Torah](/wiki/Oral_Torah \"Oral\nTorah\"), the [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\") and [Rabbinic\nlaw](/wiki/Rabbinic_law \"Rabbinic law\").[99] Chicken and other kosher birds\nare considered the same as meat under the laws of _kashrut_ , but the\nprohibition is Rabbinic, not Biblical.[102]\n\nThe use of [dishes](/wiki/Dishware \"Dishware\"), serving utensils, and\n[ovens](/wiki/Oven \"Oven\") may make food _treif_ that would otherwise be\nkosher. Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food, or dishes\nthat have held meat and are now used for dairy products, render the food\n_treif_ under certain conditions.[99]\n\nFurthermore, all [Orthodox](/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism \"Orthodox Judaism\") and\nsome [Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Judaism \"Conservative Judaism\")\nauthorities forbid the consumption of processed [grape](/wiki/Grape \"Grape\")\nproducts made by non-Jews, due to ancient [pagan](/wiki/Pagan \"Pagan\")\npractices of using wine in rituals.[99] Some Conservative authorities permit\nwine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.[103]\n\nThe [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") does not give specific reasons for most of\nthe laws of _kashrut_.[99] However, a number of explanations have been\noffered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control,\nencouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing [cruelty to\nanimals](/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals \"Cruelty to animals\") and preserving the\ndistinctness of the Jewish community.[104] The various categories of dietary\nlaws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple\nreasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds\nand mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are\ncontained.[105] In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-\nkosher species because \"they are unclean\".[106] The [Kabbalah](/wiki/Kabbalah\n\"Kabbalah\") describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of\neating kosher foods, but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be\nreleased by eating.[107]\n\nSurvival concerns supersede all the laws of _kashrut_ , as they do for most\n[halakhot](/wiki/Halakha \"Halakha\").[108][109]\n\n### Laws of ritual purity\n\nMain article: [Tumah](/wiki/Tumah \"Tumah\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/%D0%A8%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0_-_Shabbat_matchbox_holder.jpg/250px-%D0%A8%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0_-_Shabbat_matchbox_holder.jpg)](/wiki/File:%D0%A8%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0_-_Shabbat_matchbox_holder.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:%D0%A8%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0_-_Shabbat_matchbox_holder.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nA silver matchbox holder for ritual use on [Shabbat](/wiki/Shabbat \"Shabbat\")\nwith inscription in [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\")\n\nThe [Tanakh](/wiki/Tanakh \"Tanakh\") describes circumstances in which a person\nwho is _tahor_ or ritually pure may become _tamei_ or ritually impure. Some of\nthese circumstances are contact with human [corpses](/wiki/Corpses \"Corpses\")\nor [graves](/wiki/Grave_\\(burial\\) \"Grave \\(burial\\)\"), seminal flux, vaginal\nflux, [menstruation](/wiki/Menstruation \"Menstruation\"), and contact with\npeople who have become impure from any of these.[110][111] In Rabbinic\nJudaism, [Kohanim](/wiki/Kohanim \"Kohanim\"), members of the hereditary\n[caste](/wiki/Caste \"Caste\") that served as [priests](/wiki/Priests \"Priests\")\nin the time of the Temple, are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and\ntouching dead bodies.[112] During the Temple period, such priests\n([Kohanim](/wiki/Kohanim \"Kohanim\")) were required to eat their bread offering\n([Terumah](/wiki/Terumah \"Terumah\")) in a state of ritual purity, which laws\neventually led to more rigid laws being enacted, such as [hand-\nwashing](/wiki/Handwashing_in_Judaism \"Handwashing in Judaism\") which became a\nrequisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread.\n\n#### Family purity\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Fauteuil_de_circoncision_%28%22Fauteuil_d%27Elie%22%29.jpg/250px-\nFauteuil_de_circoncision_%28%22Fauteuil_d%27Elie%22%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Fauteuil_de_circoncision_\\(%22Fauteuil_d%27Elie%22\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Fauteuil_de_circoncision_\\(%22Fauteuil_d%27Elie%22\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n18th-century circumcision chair [Museum of Jewish Art and\nHistory](/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_d%27Art_et_d%27Histoire_du_Juda%C3%AFsme \"Musée\nd'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme\")\n\nMain article: [Niddah](/wiki/Niddah \"Niddah\")\n\nAn important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation\nof menstruating [women](/wiki/Women \"Women\"). These laws are also known as\n_[niddah](/wiki/Niddah \"Niddah\")_ , literally \"separation\", or family purity.\nVital aspects of halakha for traditionally observant Jews, they are not\nusually followed by Jews in liberal denominations.[113]\n\nEspecially in [Orthodox Judaism](/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism \"Orthodox Judaism\"),\nthe Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the\n[Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual\nperiod must abstain from [sexual intercourse](/wiki/Sexual_intercourse \"Sexual\nintercourse\") for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must\ncontinue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped.[110] The\nRabbis conflated ordinary _niddah_ with this extended menstrual period, known\nin the Torah as _[zavah](/wiki/Zavah \"Zavah\")_ , and mandated that a woman may\nnot have sexual intercourse with her [husband](/wiki/Husband \"Husband\") from\nthe time she begins her [menstrual](/wiki/Menstrual_cycle \"Menstrual cycle\")\nflow until seven days after it ends. In addition, [Rabbinical\nlaw](/wiki/Rabbinical_law \"Rabbinical law\") forbids the\n[husband](/wiki/Husband \"Husband\") from touching or sharing a bed with his\nwife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath\ncalled a [mikveh](/wiki/Mikveh \"Mikveh\").[113]\n\nTraditional [Ethiopian Jews](/wiki/Ethiopian_Jews \"Ethiopian Jews\") keep\nmenstruating women in separate [huts](/wiki/Huts \"Huts\") and, similar to\n[Karaite practice](/wiki/Karaite_Judaism \"Karaite Judaism\"), do not allow\nmenstruating women into their [temples](/wiki/Temples \"Temples\") because of a\ntemple's special sanctity. Emigration to [Israel](/wiki/Israel \"Israel\") and\nthe influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews\nadopting more normative Jewish practices.[114][115]\n\n### Life-cycle events\n\nLife-cycle events, or [rites of passage](/wiki/Rites_of_passage \"Rites of\npassage\"), occur throughout a Jew's life that serves to strengthen Jewish\nidentity and bind him/her to the entire community.\n\n  * [Brit milah](/wiki/Brit_milah \"Brit milah\") – Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of [circumcision](/wiki/Circumcision \"Circumcision\") on their eighth day of life. The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony. A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls, named _[zeved habat](/wiki/Zeved_habat \"Zeved habat\")_ or brit bat, enjoys limited popularity.\n  * [Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah](/wiki/Bar_Mitzvah_/_Bat_Mitzvah \"Bar Mitzvah / Bat Mitzvah\") – This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations. In the Reform movement, both girls and boys have their bat/bar mitzvah at age thirteen. This is often commemorated by having the new adults, male only in the Orthodox tradition, lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a \"portion\" of the Torah.\n  * [Marriage](/wiki/Jewish_views_of_marriage \"Jewish views of marriage\") – Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event. A wedding takes place under a _[chuppah](/wiki/Chuppah \"Chuppah\")_ , or wedding canopy, which symbolizes a happy house. At the end of the ceremony, the groom breaks a glass with his foot, symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple, and the scattering of the Jewish people.\n  * [Death and Mourning](/wiki/Bereavement_in_Judaism \"Bereavement in Judaism\") – Judaism has a multi-staged [mourning](/wiki/Mourning \"Mourning\") practice. The first stage is called the [shiva](/wiki/Shiva_\\(Judaism\\) \"Shiva \\(Judaism\\)\") (literally \"seven\", observed for one week) during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family, the second is the _shloshim_ (observed for one month) and for those who have lost one of their parents, there is a third stage, _avelut yud bet chodesh_ , which is observed for eleven months.\n\n## Community leadership\n\n### Classical priesthood\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Jewish_Children_with_their_Teacher_in_Samarkand.jpg/220px-\nJewish_Children_with_their_Teacher_in_Samarkand.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jewish_Children_with_their_Teacher_in_Samarkand.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jewish_Children_with_their_Teacher_in_Samarkand.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJewish students with their teacher in [Samarkand](/wiki/Samarkand\n\"Samarkand\"), [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan \"Uzbekistan\") c. 1910.\n\nThe role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the\ndestruction of the [Second Temple](/wiki/Second_Temple \"Second Temple\") in 70\nCE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an\ninherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial\nduties, they are still honored in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox\nJewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future [Third\nTemple](/wiki/Third_Temple \"Third Temple\") and need to remain in readiness for\nfuture duty.\n\n  * [Kohen](/wiki/Kohen \"Kohen\") (priest) – patrilineal descendant of [Aaron](/wiki/Aaron \"Aaron\"), brother of [Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\"). In the Temple, the _kohanim_ were charged with performing the sacrifices. Today, a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah, performs the [Priestly Blessing](/wiki/Priestly_Blessing \"Priestly Blessing\"), as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies, including the ceremony of redemption of the first-born.\n  * Levi ([Levite](/wiki/Levite \"Levite\")) – Patrilineal descendant of [Levi](/wiki/Levi \"Levi\") the son of [Jacob](/wiki/Jacob \"Jacob\"). In the [Temple in Jerusalem](/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem \"Temple in Jerusalem\"), the levites sang [Psalms](/wiki/Psalms \"Psalms\"), performed construction, maintenance, janitorial, and guard duties, assisted the priests, and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public. Today, a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah.\n\n### Prayer leaders\n\nFrom the time of the [Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah \"Mishnah\") and\n[Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\") to the present, Judaism has required\nspecialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies.\nA Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some\nactivities—reading the [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") and _haftarah_ (a\nsupplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners,\nthe blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals—require\na _[minyan](/wiki/Minyan \"Minyan\")_ , the presence of ten Jews.\n\nThe most common professional clergy in a [synagogue](/wiki/Synagogue\n\"Synagogue\") are:\n\n  * [Rabbi](/wiki/Rabbi \"Rabbi\") of a congregation – Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation. This role requires ordination by the congregation's preferred authority (i.e., from a respected Orthodox rabbi or, if the congregation is Conservative or Reform, from academic seminaries). A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi. Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as _shatz_ or _baal kriyah_ (see below). \n    * Hassidic _[Rebbe](/wiki/Rebbe \"Rebbe\")_ – rabbi who is the head of a [Hasidic](/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism \"Hasidic Judaism\") dynasty.\n  * [Hazzan](/wiki/Hazzan \"Hazzan\") (note: the \"h\" denotes [voiceless pharyngeal fricative](/wiki/Voiceless_pharyngeal_fricative \"Voiceless pharyngeal fricative\")) (cantor) – a trained vocalist who acts as _shatz_. Chosen for a good voice, knowledge of traditional tunes, understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them. A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan.\n\nJewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes,\nbut not always, filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations. In other\ncongregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the\ncongregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:\n\n  * Shaliach tzibur or _Shatz_ (leader—literally \"agent\" or \"representative\"—of the congregation) leads those assembled in prayer and sometimes prays on behalf of the community. When a _shatz_ recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation, he is _not_ acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator. The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying _amen_ at their conclusion; it is with this act that the _shatz 's_ prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation. Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as _shatz_. In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations, only men can be prayer leaders, but all [Progressive](/wiki/Progressive_Judaism \"Progressive Judaism\") communities now allow women to serve in this function.\n  * The Baal kriyah or _baal koreh_ (master of the reading) reads the weekly [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") portion. The requirements for being the _baal kriyah_ are the same as those for the _shatz_. These roles are not mutually exclusive. The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does. Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services (or parts of services) will be led by each.\n\nMany congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:\n\n  * [Gabbai](/wiki/Gabbai \"Gabbai\") (sexton) – Calls people up to the Torah, appoints the _shatz_ for each prayer session if there is no standard _shatz_ , and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied.\n\nThe three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor.\nSince the [Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment \"Age of Enlightenment\")\nlarge synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans\nto act as _shatz_ and _baal kriyah_ , and this is still typically the case in\nmany Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox\nsynagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc\nbasis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a\nprofessional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the\nuse of professionals for other offices is rarer still.\n\n### Specialized religious roles\n\n  * _[Dayan](/wiki/Beth_din#Officers_of_a_beth_din \"Beth din\")_ (judge) – An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a _[beth din](/wiki/Beth_din \"Beth din\")_ (rabbinical court). In Israel, religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases, conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community.\n  * [Mohel](/wiki/Mohel \"Mohel\") (circumciser) – An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training from a previously qualified _mohel_ and performs the _[brit milah](/wiki/Brit_milah \"Brit milah\")_ (circumcision).\n  * [Shochet](/wiki/Shechita \"Shechita\") (ritual slaughterer) – In order for meat to be kosher, it must be slaughtered by a _shochet_ who is an expert in the laws of kashrut and has been trained by another _shochet._\n  * [Sofer](/wiki/Sofer_\\(scribe\\) \"Sofer \\(scribe\\)\") (scribe) – [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") scrolls, _[tefillin](/wiki/Tefillin \"Tefillin\")_ (phylacteries), _[mezuzot](/wiki/Mezuzah \"Mezuzah\")_ (scrolls put on doorposts), and _gittin_ (bills of divorce) must be written by a _sofer_ who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts.\n  * [Rosh yeshiva](/wiki/Rosh_yeshiva \"Rosh yeshiva\") – A Torah scholar who runs a [yeshiva](/wiki/Yeshiva \"Yeshiva\").\n  * [Mashgiach](/wiki/Mashgiach_ruchani \"Mashgiach ruchani\") of a yeshiva – Depending on which yeshiva, might either be the person responsible for ensuring attendance and proper conduct, or even supervise the emotional and spiritual welfare of the students and give lectures on [mussar](/wiki/Mussar_movement \"Mussar movement\") (Jewish ethics).\n  * [Mashgiach](/wiki/Mashgiach \"Mashgiach\") – Supervises manufacturers of kosher food, importers, caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher. Must be an expert in the laws of [kashrut](/wiki/Kashrut \"Kashrut\") and trained by a rabbi, if not a rabbi himself.\n\n## History\n\nMain article: [Jewish history](/wiki/Jewish_history \"Jewish history\")\n\nThis section is about the history of Judaism.

[Abraham](/wiki/Abraham \"Abraham\") is hailed as the\nfirst [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrews \"Hebrews\") and the father of the Jewish people.\nAs a reward for his act of faith in one God, he was promised that\n[Isaac](/wiki/Isaac \"Isaac\"), his second son, would inherit the [Land of\nIsrael](/wiki/Land_of_Israel \"Land of Israel\") (then called\n[Canaan](/wiki/Canaan \"Canaan\")). Later, the descendants of Isaac's son\n[Jacob](/wiki/Jacob \"Jacob\") were enslaved in [Egypt](/wiki/Ancient_Egypt\n\"Ancient Egypt\"), and God commanded [Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\") to lead [the\nExodus](/wiki/The_Exodus \"The Exodus\") from Egypt. At [Mount\nSinai](/wiki/Biblical_Mount_Sinai \"Biblical Mount Sinai\"), they received the\n[Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\")—the five books of Moses. These books, together\nwith [Nevi'im](/wiki/Nevi%27im \"Nevi'im\") and [Ketuvim](/wiki/Ketuvim\n\"Ketuvim\") are known as _Torah Shebikhtav_ as opposed to the [Oral\nTorah](/wiki/Oral_Torah \"Oral Torah\"), which refers to the Mishnah and the\nTalmud. Eventually, God led them to the [land of Israel](/wiki/Land_of_Israel\n\"Land of Israel\") where the [tabernacle](/wiki/Tabernacle \"Tabernacle\") was\nplanted in the city of [Shiloh](/wiki/Shiloh_\\(Biblical\\) \"Shiloh\n\\(Biblical\\)\") for over 300 years to rally the nation against attacking\nenemies. As time went on, the spiritual level of the nation declined to the\npoint that God allowed the [Philistines](/wiki/Philistines \"Philistines\") to\ncapture the tabernacle. The people of Israel then told\n[Samuel](/wiki/Samuel_\\(Bible\\) \"Samuel \\(Bible\\)\") the\n[prophet](/wiki/Prophet \"Prophet\") that they needed to be governed by a\npermanent king, and Samuel appointed [Saul](/wiki/Saul_the_King \"Saul the\nKing\") to be their King. When the people pressured Saul into going against a\ncommand conveyed to him by Samuel, God told Samuel to appoint\n[David](/wiki/David \"David\") in his stead.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Western_wall_jerusalem_night.jpg/220px-\nWestern_wall_jerusalem_night.jpg)](/wiki/File:Western_wall_jerusalem_night.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Western_wall_jerusalem_night.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Western Wall](/wiki/Western_Wall \"Western Wall\") in\n[Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\") is a remnant of the wall encircling\nthe [Second Temple](/wiki/Second_Temple \"Second Temple\").

However, as\nthe persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being\nforgotten, these oral laws were recorded by [Rabbi](/wiki/Rabbi \"Rabbi\")\n[Judah HaNasi](/wiki/Judah_HaNasi \"Judah HaNasi\") (Judah the Prince) in the\n[Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah \"Mishnah\"), redacted _circa_ 200 CE. The\n[Talmud](/wiki/Talmud \"Talmud\") was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the\n[Gemara](/wiki/Gemara \"Gemara\"), rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next\nthree centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish\nscholarship, [Palestine](/wiki/Talmudic_Academies_in_Syria_Palaestina\n\"Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina\") and\n[Babylonia](/wiki/Talmudic_Academies_in_Babylonia \"Talmudic Academies in\nBabylonia\").[116] Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two\nworks of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the [Jerusalem\nTalmud](/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud \"Jerusalem Talmud\"). It was compiled sometime\nduring the 4th century in\n[Palestine](/wiki/Talmudic_Academies_in_Syria_Palaestina \"Talmudic Academies\nin Syria Palaestina\").[116] The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from\ndiscussions in the houses of study by the scholars [Ravina I](/wiki/Ravina_I\n\"Ravina I\"), [Ravina II](/wiki/Ravina_II \"Ravina II\"), and [Rav\nAshi](/wiki/Rav_Ashi \"Rav Ashi\") by 500 CE, although it continued to be edited\nlater.\n\nSome critical scholars oppose the view that the sacred texts, including the\n[Hebrew Bible](/wiki/Tanakh \"Tanakh\"), were divinely inspired. Many of these\nscholars accept the general principles of the [documentary\nhypothesis](/wiki/Documentary_hypothesis \"Documentary hypothesis\") and suggest\nthat the [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") consists of inconsistent texts edited\ntogether in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts.[117][_[page\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_][118][119]\nMany suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel\nbelieved that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to\nother gods.[120][_[page needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_][121][_[page\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] Some\nsuggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps\nin reaction to [Zoroastrian](/wiki/Zoroastrian \"Zoroastrian\") dualism.[122] In\nthis view, it was only by the [Hellenic period](/wiki/Hellenic_period\n\"Hellenic period\") that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only\ngod and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the\nJewish religion formed.[123]\n\n[John Day](/wiki/John_Day_\\(Old_Testament_scholar\\) \"John Day \\(Old Testament\nscholar\\)\") argues that the origins of biblical [Yahweh](/wiki/Yahweh\n\"Yahweh\"), [El](/wiki/El_\\(deity\\) \"El \\(deity\\)\"), [Asherah](/wiki/Asherah\n\"Asherah\"), and [Ba'al](/wiki/Ba%27al \"Ba'al\"), may be rooted in earlier\n[Canaanite religion](/wiki/Canaanite_religion \"Canaanite religion\"), which was\ncentered on a pantheon of gods much like the [Greek\npantheon](/wiki/Greek_pantheon \"Greek pantheon\").[124]\n\n### Antiquity\n\nMain articles: [Ancient Israel and Judah](/wiki/Ancient_Israel_and_Judah\n\"Ancient Israel and Judah\"), [Babylonian captivity](/wiki/Babylonian_captivity\n\"Babylonian captivity\"), [Hellenistic Judaism](/wiki/Hellenistic_Judaism\n\"Hellenistic Judaism\"), [Hasmonean Kingdom](/wiki/Hasmonean_Kingdom \"Hasmonean\nKingdom\"), [Iudaea Province](/wiki/Iudaea_Province \"Iudaea Province\"), and\n[Bar Kokhba revolt](/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt \"Bar Kokhba revolt\")\n\nAccording to the [Hebrew Bible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible \"Hebrew Bible\"), the\n[United Monarchy](/wiki/United_Monarchy \"United Monarchy\") was established\nunder [Saul](/wiki/Saul_the_King \"Saul the King\") and continued under [King\nDavid](/wiki/King_David \"King David\") and [Solomon](/wiki/Solomon \"Solomon\")\nwith its capital in [Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\"). After Solomon's\nreign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the [Kingdom of\nIsrael](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_\\(Samaria\\) \"Kingdom of Israel \\(Samaria\\)\")\n(in the north) and the [Kingdom of Judah](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah \"Kingdom of\nJudah\") (in the south). The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the\n[Assyrian](/wiki/Assyria \"Assyria\") ruler [Sargon II](/wiki/Sargon_II \"Sargon\nII\") in the late 8th century BCE with many people from the capital Samaria\nbeing taken captive to Media and the [Khabur River](/wiki/Khabur_\\(Euphrates\\)\n\"Khabur \\(Euphrates\\)\") valley. The [Kingdom of Judah](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah\n\"Kingdom of Judah\") continued as an independent state until it was conquered\nby a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE, destroying the [First\nTemple](/wiki/First_Temple \"First Temple\") that was at the center of ancient\nJewish worship. The Judean elite was exiled to [Babylonia](/wiki/Babylonia\n\"Babylonia\") and this is regarded as the first Jewish Diaspora. Later many of\nthem returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by\nthe [Persians](/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire \"Achaemenid Empire\") seventy years\nlater, a period known as the [Babylonian Captivity](/wiki/Babylonian_Captivity\n\"Babylonian Captivity\"). A new [Second Temple](/wiki/Second_Temple \"Second\nTemple\") was constructed, and old religious practices were resumed.\n\nDuring the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority\nwas a council known as the Great Assembly, led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra.\nAmong other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Bible\nwere written at this time and the canon sealed.\n\n[Hellenistic Judaism](/wiki/Hellenistic_Judaism \"Hellenistic Judaism\") spread\nto [Ptolemaic Egypt](/wiki/Ptolemaic_Egypt \"Ptolemaic Egypt\") from the 3rd\ncentury BCE. After [the Great Revolt](/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War\n\"First Jewish–Roman War\") (66–73 CE), the Romans destroyed the Temple.\n[Hadrian](/wiki/Hadrian \"Hadrian\") built a pagan idol on the Temple grounds\nand prohibited circumcision; these acts of ethnocide provoked the [Bar Kokhba\nrevolt](/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt \"Bar Kokhba revolt\") 132–136 CE after which\nthe Romans banned the study of the [Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") and the\ncelebration of Jewish holidays, and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from\nJudea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was\nrecognized as a _[religio licita](/wiki/Religio_licita \"Religio licita\")_\n(\"legitimate religion\") until the rise of [Gnosticism](/wiki/Gnosticism\n\"Gnosticism\") and [Early Christianity](/wiki/Early_Christianity \"Early\nChristianity\") in the fourth century.\n\nFollowing the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish\nworship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the\nplace of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around the community (represented\nby a minimum of ten adult men) and the establishment of the authority of\nrabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities (see\n[Jewish diaspora](/wiki/Jewish_diaspora \"Jewish diaspora\")).\n\n### Historical Jewish groupings (to 1700)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Parochet_of_Beth_Jakov_Macedonia.jpg/220px-\nParochet_of_Beth_Jakov_Macedonia.jpg)](/wiki/File:Parochet_of_Beth_Jakov_Macedonia.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Parochet_of_Beth_Jakov_Macedonia.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Torah Ark](/wiki/Torah_Ark \"Torah Ark\") of the Beth Jakov synagogue in\n[Macedonia](/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia \"Republic of Macedonia\")\n\nAround the 1st century CE, there were several small Jewish sects: the\n[Pharisees](/wiki/Pharisees \"Pharisees\"), [Sadducees](/wiki/Sadducees\n\"Sadducees\"), [Zealots](/wiki/Zealots \"Zealots\"), [Essenes](/wiki/Essenes\n\"Essenes\"), and [Christians](/wiki/Early_Christianity \"Early Christianity\").\nAfter the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects\nvanished.[125] [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity \"Christianity\") survived, but\nby breaking with Judaism and [becoming a separate\nreligion](/wiki/Schism_\\(religion\\) \"Schism \\(religion\\)\"); the\n[Pharisees](/wiki/Pharisees \"Pharisees\") survived but in the form of [Rabbinic\nJudaism](/wiki/Rabbinic_Judaism \"Rabbinic Judaism\") (today, known simply as\n\"Judaism\"). The [Sadducees](/wiki/Sadducees \"Sadducees\") rejected the [divine\ninspiration](/wiki/Revelation \"Revelation\") of the [Prophets](/wiki/Nevi%27im\n\"Nevi'im\") and the [Writings](/wiki/Ketuvim \"Ketuvim\"), relying only on the\n[Torah](/wiki/Torah \"Torah\") as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of\nother core tenets of the Pharisees' belief system (which became the basis for\nmodern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. (The\n[Samaritans](/wiki/Samaritans \"Samaritans\") practiced a similar religion,\nwhich is traditionally considered separate from Judaism.)\n\nLike the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th\ncenturies rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the [oral\nlaw](/wiki/Oral_law \"Oral law\") as recorded in the [Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah\n\"Mishnah\") (and developed by later rabbis in the two [Talmuds](/wiki/Talmud\n\"Talmud\")), relying instead only upon the [Tanakh](/wiki/Tanakh \"Tanakh\").\nThese included the Isunians, the Yudganites, the [Malikites](/wiki/Malikites\n\"Malikites\"), and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own,\nwhich differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the\n[Karaite](/wiki/Karaism \"Karaism\") sect. Karaites exist in small numbers\ntoday, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the\nothers are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.\n\nOver a long time, Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different\ngeographic areas—amongst others, the [Ashkenazi Jews](/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews\n\"Ashkenazi Jews\") (of [central](/wiki/Central_Europe \"Central Europe\") and\n[Eastern Europe](/wiki/Eastern_Europe \"Eastern Europe\")), the [Sephardi\nJews](/wiki/Sephardi_Jews \"Sephardi Jews\") (of Spain,\n[Portugal](/wiki/Portugal \"Portugal\"), and [North Africa](/wiki/North_Africa\n\"North Africa\")), the [Beta Israel](/wiki/Beta_Israel \"Beta Israel\") of\n[Ethiopia](/wiki/Ethiopia \"Ethiopia\"), and the [Yemenite\nJews](/wiki/Yemenite_Jews \"Yemenite Jews\") from the southern tip of the\n[Arabian Peninsula](/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula \"Arabian Peninsula\"). Many of\nthese groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and\naccepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result of their\nbeing formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism,\nrather than based on any doctrinal dispute.\n\n### Persecutions\n\nMain articles: [Persecution of Jews](/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews \"Persecution of\nJews\"), [Antisemitism](/wiki/Antisemitism \"Antisemitism\"), and [History of\nantisemitism](/wiki/History_of_antisemitism \"History of antisemitism\")\n\n[Antisemitism](/wiki/Antisemitism \"Antisemitism\") arose during the [Middle\nAges](/wiki/Middle_Ages \"Middle Ages\"), in the form of persecutions,\n[pogroms](/wiki/Pogrom \"Pogrom\"), [forced conversions](/wiki/Forced_conversion\n\"Forced conversion\"), expulsions, social restrictions and\n[ghettoization](/wiki/Ghetto \"Ghetto\").\n\nThis was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred\nin ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were\ntreated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With the rise of the\nChurches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to\nreligion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived\nfrom Christian views about Jews and Judaism.[126] During the [Middle\nAges](/wiki/Middle_Ages \"Middle Ages\"), Jewish people who lived under Muslim\nrule generally experienced tolerance and integration,[127] but there were\noccasional outbreaks of violence like [Almohad's\npersecutions](/wiki/Almohads#Status_of_non-Muslims \"Almohads\").[128]\n\n### Hasidism\n\nMain article: [Hasidic Judaism](/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism \"Hasidic Judaism\")\n\nHasidic Judaism was founded by [Yisroel ben\nEliezer](/wiki/Yisroel_ben_Eliezer_\\(The_Baal_Shem_Tov\\) \"Yisroel ben Eliezer\n\\(The Baal Shem Tov\\)\") (1700–1760), also known as the _Ba 'al Shem Tov_ (or\n_Besht_). It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when\nEuropean Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most\nexpressions of Jewish life had become too \"academic\", and that they no longer\nhad any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favored small and\ninformal gatherings called [Shtiebel](/wiki/Shtiebel \"Shtiebel\"), which, in\ncontrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship\nand for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing.[129] Ba'al\nShem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established\nnumerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically\nexpanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely\nowing to [Tzadiks](/wiki/Tzadik \"Tzadik\"), who used their influence to\nencourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans\nbecause it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and\npresented a compelling spectacle.[130] Hasidic Judaism eventually became the\nway of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in\nthe 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be\nnothing new, but a _refreshment_ of original Judaism. As some have put it: _\"\nthey merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost\"_. Nevertheless,\nearly on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews.\nEuropean Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as\n[Misnagdim](/wiki/Misnagdim \"Misnagdim\"), (lit. \"opponents\"). Some of the\nreasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic\nworship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles\nto their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over\ntime differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly\ndiminished and both groups are now considered part of [Haredi\nJudaism](/wiki/Haredi_Judaism \"Haredi Judaism\").\n\n### The Enlightenment and new religious movements\n\nMain articles: [Haskalah](/wiki/Haskalah \"Haskalah\") and [Jewish religious\nmovements](/wiki/Jewish_religious_movements \"Jewish religious movements\")\n\nIn the late 18th century CE, Europe was swept by a group of intellectual,\nsocial and political movements known as the\n[Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment \"Age of Enlightenment\"). The\nEnlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to\ninteract with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular\neducation and experience. A parallel Jewish movement,\n[Haskalah](/wiki/Haskalah \"Haskalah\") or the \"Jewish Enlightenment\", began,\nespecially in [Central Europe](/wiki/Central_Europe \"Central Europe\") and\n[Western Europe](/wiki/Western_Europe \"Western Europe\"), in response to both\nthe Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration\nwith secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason.\nWith the promise of political emancipation, many Jews saw no reason to\ncontinue to observe Jewish law and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into\nChristian Europe. Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction\nto this trend.\n\nIn [Central Europe](/wiki/Central_Europe \"Central Europe\"), followed by [Great\nBritain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\") and the United States, [Reform\n(or Liberal) Judaism](/wiki/Reform_Judaism \"Reform Judaism\") developed,\nrelaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations\nwith non-Jews), emulating [Protestant](/wiki/Protestant \"Protestant\") decorum\nin prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic\ntradition. [Modern Orthodox Judaism](/wiki/Modern_Orthodox_Judaism \"Modern\nOrthodox Judaism\") developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who\nargued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to\nChristians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law. Meanwhile, in the\nUnited States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox\nin practice but critical (and skeptical) in their study of the Bible and\nTalmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern\nEurope. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform\nrabbis who felt that Jewish law should not be entirely abandoned, to form the\n[Conservative movement](/wiki/Conservative_Judaism \"Conservative Judaism\").\nOrthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed [Haredi Orthodox\nJudaism](/wiki/Haredi_Orthodox_Judaism \"Haredi Orthodox Judaism\"). After\nmassive movements of Jews following [The Holocaust](/wiki/The_Holocaust \"The\nHolocaust\") and the creation of [the state of Israel](/wiki/Israel \"Israel\"),\nthese movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or\nfrom other countries.\n\n### Spectrum of observance\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/KnesetEliyahooSynagogue.JPG/220px-\nKnesetEliyahooSynagogue.JPG)](/wiki/File:KnesetEliyahooSynagogue.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:KnesetEliyahooSynagogue.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nJudaism is practised in all parts of the world, for example in a synagogue in\ndowntown [Mumbai](/wiki/Mumbai \"Mumbai\").\n\nCountries such as the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"),\n[Israel](/wiki/Israel \"Israel\"), [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\"), [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"), [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina\n\"Argentina\") and [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\") contain\nlarge Jewish populations. Jewish religious practice varies widely through all\nlevels of observance. According to the 2001 edition of the [National Jewish\nPopulation Survey](/wiki/National_Jewish_Population_Survey \"National Jewish\nPopulation Survey\"), in the United States' Jewish community—the world's second\nlargest—4.3 million Jews out of 5.1 million had some sort of connection to the\nreligion.[131] Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some\nsort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a congregation,\nand fewer than 16% attend regularly.[132]\n\nBirth rates for American Jews have dropped from 2.0 to 1.7.[133] (Replacement\nrate is 2.1.) Intermarriage rates range from 40–50% in the US, and only about\na third of children of intermarried couples are raised as Jews. Due to\nintermarriage and low birth rates, the Jewish population in the US shrank from\n5.5 million in 1990 to 5.1 million in 2001. This is indicative of the general\npopulation trends among the Jewish community in the [Diaspora](/wiki/Diaspora\n\"Diaspora\"), but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some\ndenominations and communities, such as [Haredi Judaism](/wiki/Haredi_Judaism\n\"Haredi Judaism\"). The [Baal teshuva](/wiki/Baal_teshuva \"Baal teshuva\")\nmovement is a movement of Jews who have \"returned\" to religion or become more\nobservant.\n\n## Judaism and other religions\n\n### Christianity and Judaism\n\nMain article: [Christianity and Judaism](/wiki/Christianity_and_Judaism\n\"Christianity and Judaism\")\n\nSee also: [Christianity and antisemitism](/wiki/Christianity_and_antisemitism\n\"Christianity and antisemitism\") and [Christian–Jewish\nreconciliation](/wiki/Christian%E2%80%93Jewish_reconciliation\n\"Christian–Jewish reconciliation\")\n\n[Christianity](/wiki/Christianity \"Christianity\") was originally a sect of\n[Second Temple Judaism](/wiki/Second_Temple_Judaism \"Second Temple Judaism\"),\nbut the two religions [diverged in the first\ncentury](/wiki/Split_of_early_Christianity_and_Judaism \"Split of early\nChristianity and Judaism\"). The differences between Christianity and Judaism\noriginally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually\nbecame irreconcilable. Major differences between the two faiths include the\nnature of the Messiah, of [atonement](/wiki/Atonement_in_Judaism \"Atonement in\nJudaism\") and [sin](/wiki/Jewish_views_on_sin \"Jewish views on sin\"), the\nstatus of God's commandments to Israel, and perhaps most significantly of the\n[nature of God](/wiki/God_in_Judaism \"God in Judaism\") himself. Due to these\ndifferences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as\n[Shituf](/wiki/Shituf \"Shituf\") or worship of the God of Israel which is not\nmonotheistic. Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with\nthe invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church,\nthough a Christian belief in [dual-covenant theology](/wiki/Dual-\ncovenant_theology \"Dual-covenant theology\") emerged as a phenomenon following\nChristian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi\n[Holocaust](/wiki/The_Holocaust \"The Holocaust\").[134]\n\nSince the time of the [Middle\nAges](/wiki/History_of_Christianity_during_the_Middle_Ages \"History of\nChristianity during the Middle Ages\"), the [Catholic\nChurch](/wiki/Catholic_Church \"Catholic Church\") upheld the _[Constitution pro\nJudæis](/wiki/Sicut_Judaeis \"Sicut Judaeis\")_ (Formal Statement on the Jews),\nwhich stated\n\n> We decree that no Christian shall use violence to force them to be baptized,\n> so long as they are unwilling and refuse. ... Without the judgment of the\n> political authority of the land, no Christian shall presume to wound them or\n> kill them or rob them of their money or change the good customs that they\n> have thus far enjoyed in the place where they live.\"[135]\n\nUntil [their emancipation](/wiki/Jewish_emancipation \"Jewish emancipation\") in\nthe late 18th and the 19th century, Jews in Christian lands were subject to\nhumiliating legal restrictions and limitations. They included provisions\nrequiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the [Jewish\nhat](/wiki/Jewish_hat \"Jewish hat\") and the [yellow badge](/wiki/Yellow_badge\n\"Yellow badge\"), restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain\nparts of towns ([ghettos](/wiki/Jewish_ghettos_in_Europe \"Jewish ghettos in\nEurope\")), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling\nnew clothes in medieval [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden \"Sweden\")). Disabilities also\nincluded special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints\non the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some\ncountries went even further and completely expelled Jews, for example,\n[England](/wiki/Edict_of_Expulsion \"Edict of Expulsion\") in 1290 (Jews were\nreadmitted in 1655) and [Spain](/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Jews_from_Spain\n\"Expulsion of the Jews from Spain\") in 1492 (readmitted in 1868). The first\nJewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of [New\nAmsterdam](/wiki/New_Amsterdam \"New Amsterdam\") in 1654; they were forbidden\nto hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the\ncolony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but\nby 1671 [Asser Levy](/wiki/Asser_Levy \"Asser Levy\") was the first Jew to serve\non a jury in North America.[136] In 1791, [Revolutionary\nFrance](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French Revolution\") was the first country to\nabolish disabilities altogether, followed by [Prussia](/wiki/Prussia\n\"Prussia\") in 1848. [Emancipation of the Jews in the United\nKingdom](/wiki/Emancipation_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Emancipation of\nthe Jews in the United Kingdom\") was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year\nstruggle championed by [Isaac Lyon Goldsmid](/wiki/Isaac_Lyon_Goldsmid \"Isaac\nLyon Goldsmid\")[137] with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the\npassing of the [Jews Relief Act 1858](/wiki/Jews_Relief_Act_1858 \"Jews Relief\nAct 1858\"). The newly united [German Empire](/wiki/German_Empire \"German\nEmpire\") in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany, which were\nreinstated in the [Nuremberg Laws](/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws \"Nuremberg Laws\") in\n1935.\n\nJewish life in Christian lands was marked by frequent [blood\nlibels](/wiki/Blood_libel \"Blood libel\"), expulsions, [forced\nconversions](/wiki/Forced_conversion \"Forced conversion\") and\n[massacres](/wiki/Massacre \"Massacre\"). An underlying source of prejudice\nagainst Jews in Europe was religious. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards\nJews developed in the [early years of Christianity](/wiki/Apostolic_Age\n\"Apostolic Age\") and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures\nover the [ensuing centuries](/wiki/Early_Christianity \"Early Christianity\").\nThe action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence, and\nmurder culminating in the [Holocaust](/wiki/Holocaust\n\"Holocaust\").[138]:21[139]:169[140] These attitudes were reinforced in\nChristian preaching, art and popular teaching for two millennia, containing\ncontempt for Jews,[141] as well as statutes which were designed to humiliate\nand stigmatise Jews. The [Nazi Party](/wiki/Nazi_Party \"Nazi Party\") was known\nfor its [persecution of Christian Churches](/wiki/Kirchenkampf\n\"Kirchenkampf\"); many of them, such as the Protestant [Confessing\nChurch](/wiki/Confessing_Church \"Confessing Church\") and the Catholic\nChurch,[142] as well as [Quakers](/wiki/Quakers \"Quakers\") and [Jehovah's\nWitnesses](/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses \"Jehovah's Witnesses\"), aided and\nrescued Jews who were being targeted by the antireligious régime.[143]\n\nThe attitude of Christians and Christian Churches toward the Jewish people and\nJudaism, have been changed mostly positive since [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"). Pope [John Paul II](/wiki/John_Paul_II\n\"John Paul II\") and the Catholic Church have \"upheld the Church's acceptance\nof the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people\" as well as a\n[reaffirmation of the covenant](/wiki/Dual-covenant_theology \"Dual-covenant\ntheology\") between [God](/wiki/God_in_Christianity \"God in Christianity\") and\nthe Jews.[144] In December 2015, the [Vatican](/wiki/Holy_See \"Holy See\")\nreleased a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that\nCatholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.[145]\n\n### Islam and Judaism\n\nMain article: [Islam and Judaism](/wiki/Islam_and_Judaism \"Islam and Judaism\")\n\nBoth Judaism and [Islam](/wiki/Islam \"Islam\") arose from the patriarch\n[Abraham](/wiki/Abraham \"Abraham\"), and they are therefore considered\n[Abrahamic religions](/wiki/Abrahamic_religions \"Abrahamic religions\"). In\nboth Jewish and [Muslim](/wiki/Muslim \"Muslim\") tradition, the Jewish and\n[Arab peoples](/wiki/Arabs \"Arabs\") are descended from the two sons of\nAbraham—[Isaac](/wiki/Isaac \"Isaac\") and [Ishmael](/wiki/Ishmael \"Ishmael\"),\nrespectively. While both religions are [monotheistic](/wiki/Monotheism\n\"Monotheism\") and share many commonalities, they differ based on the fact that\nJews do not consider [Jesus](/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam \"Jesus in Islam\") or\n[Muhammad](/wiki/Muhammad \"Muhammad\") to be prophets. The religions' adherents\nhave interacted with each other since the 7th century when [Islam](/wiki/Islam\n\"Islam\") originated and spread in the [Arabian\npeninsula](/wiki/Arabian_peninsula \"Arabian peninsula\"). Indeed, the years 712\nto 1066 CE under the [Ummayad](/wiki/Ummayad \"Ummayad\") and the\n[Abbasid](/wiki/Abbasid \"Abbasid\") rulers have been called the [Golden age of\nJewish culture in Spain](/wiki/Golden_age_of_Jewish_culture_in_Spain \"Golden\nage of Jewish culture in Spain\"). Non-Muslim monotheists living in these\ncountries, including Jews, were known as [dhimmis](/wiki/Dhimmis \"Dhimmis\").\nDhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own\ninternal affairs, but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not\nimposed on Muslims.[146] For example, they had to pay the [jizya](/wiki/Jizya\n\"Jizya\"), a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males,[146] and\nthey were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving\nMuslims.[147] Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic. For\nexample, dhimmis in some countries were required to wear [distinctive\nclothing](/wiki/Yellow_badge \"Yellow badge\"), a practice not found in either\nthe [Qur'an](/wiki/Qur%27an \"Qur'an\") or the [hadiths](/wiki/Hadiths\n\"Hadiths\") but invented in [early medieval](/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages \"Early\nMiddle Ages\") [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\") and inconsistently\nenforced.[148] Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from\npersecution—for example, many were killed, exiled or forcibly converted in the\n12th century, in [Persia](/wiki/Persia \"Persia\"), and by the rulers of the\n[Almohad](/wiki/Almohad \"Almohad\") dynasty in North Africa and [Al-\nAndalus](/wiki/Al-Andalus \"Al-Andalus\"),[149] as well as by the Zaydi imams of\nYemen in the 17th century (see: [Mawza Exile](/wiki/Mawza_Exile \"Mawza\nExile\")). At times, Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence—in\n[Morocco](/wiki/Morocco \"Morocco\"), for example, Jews were confined to walled\nquarters ([mellahs](/wiki/Mellah \"Mellah\")) beginning in the 15th century and\nincreasingly since the early 19th century.[150]\n\nIn the mid-20th century, Jews were expelled from nearly all of the Arab\ncountries.[151][152][153] Most have chosen to live in [Israel](/wiki/Israel\n\"Israel\"). Today, antisemitic themes including [Holocaust\ndenial](/wiki/Holocaust_denial \"Holocaust denial\") have become commonplace in\nthe propaganda of Islamic movements such as [Hizbullah](/wiki/Hizbullah\n\"Hizbullah\") and [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas \"Hamas\"), in the pronouncements of\nvarious agencies of the [Islamic Republic of\nIran](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran \"Islamic Republic of Iran\"), and even in\nthe newspapers and other publications of [Refah Partisi](/wiki/Refah_Partisi\n\"Refah Partisi\").[154]\n\n### Syncretic movements incorporating Judaism\n\nThere are some movements that combine elements of Judaism with those of other\nreligions. The most well-known of these is [Messianic\nJudaism](/wiki/Messianic_Judaism \"Messianic Judaism\"), a religious movement,\nwhich arose in the 1960s,[155][156][157][158] that incorporates elements of\nJudaism with the [tenets of Christianity](/wiki/Christianity#Beliefs\n\"Christianity\").[158][159][160][161][162] The movement generally states that\n[Jesus](/wiki/Jesus \"Jesus\") is the Jewish Messiah, that he is one of the\n[Three Divine Persons](/wiki/Trinity \"Trinity\"),[163][164] and that\n[salvation](/wiki/Salvation_\\(Christianity\\) \"Salvation \\(Christianity\\)\") is\nonly achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior.[165] Some members\nof the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism.[166] Jewish\norganizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic\nJudaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to\nthose of [Pauline Christianity](/wiki/Pauline_Christianity \"Pauline\nChristianity\").[167]\n\nOther examples of [syncretism](/wiki/Syncretism \"Syncretism\") include [Semitic\nneopaganism](/wiki/Semitic_neopaganism \"Semitic neopaganism\"), a loosely\norganized sect which incorporates [pagan](/wiki/Paganism \"Paganism\") or\n[Wiccan](/wiki/Wicca \"Wicca\") beliefs with some Jewish religious practices;\n[Jewish Buddhists](/wiki/Jewish_Buddhists \"Jewish Buddhists\"), another loosely\norganized group that incorporates elements of Asian spirituality in their\nfaith; and some [Renewal Jews](/wiki/Jewish_Renewal \"Jewish Renewal\") who\nborrow freely and openly from [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism \"Buddhism\"),\n[Sufism](/wiki/Sufism \"Sufism\"), [Native\nAmerican](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas \"Indigenous peoples of the\nAmericas\") religions, and other faiths.\n\nThe [Kabbalah Centre](/wiki/Kabbalah_Centre \"Kabbalah Centre\"), which employs\nteachers from multiple religions, is a [New Age](/wiki/New_Age \"New Age\")\nmovement that claims to popularize the [kabbalah](/wiki/Kabbalah \"Kabbalah\"),\npart of the [Jewish esoteric tradition](/wiki/Jewish_mysticism \"Jewish\nmysticism\").\n\n## See also\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_of_David.svg/24px-Star_of_David.svg.png)[Judaism portal](/wiki/Portal:Judaism \"Portal:Judaism\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/P_religion_world.svg/31px-P_religion_world.svg.png)](/wiki/File:P_religion_world.svg)[Religion portal](/wiki/Portal:Religion \"Portal:Religion\")\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png) | \n\n  * [Book: Abrahamic religions](/wiki/Book:Abrahamic_religions \"Book:Abrahamic religions\")\n  * [Book: Judaism](/wiki/Book:Judaism \"Book:Judaism\")\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \n  * [Anti-Judaism](/wiki/Anti-Judaism \"Anti-Judaism\")\n  * [Criticism of Judaism](/wiki/Criticism_of_Judaism \"Criticism of Judaism\")\n  * [Frankism](/wiki/Frankism \"Frankism\")\n  * [Jewish assimilation](/wiki/Jewish_assimilation \"Jewish assimilation\")\n  * [Jewish culture](/wiki/Jewish_culture \"Jewish culture\")\n  * [Jewish views of religious pluralism](/wiki/Jewish_views_of_religious_pluralism \"Jewish views of religious pluralism\")\n  * [Judaism by country](/wiki/Judaism_by_country \"Judaism by country\")\n  * [List of converts to Judaism](/wiki/List_of_converts_to_Judaism \"List of converts to Judaism\")\n  * [Outline of Judaism](/wiki/Outline_of_Judaism \"Outline of Judaism\")\n  * [Sabbateanism](/wiki/Sabbateanism \"Sabbateanism\")\n  * [Sumer](/wiki/Sumer \"Sumer\")\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"The Bible and Interpretation\"](http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/mason3.shtml).\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Oxford Dictionaries – Dictionary, Thesaurus, & Grammar\"](http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/judaism?view=uk).\n  3. **Jump up ^** Shaye J.D.

This universal humanity, however, was predicated (and still is) on the dualism of the flesh and the spirit, such that while the body is particular, marked through practice as Jew or Greek, and through anatomy as male or female, the spirit is universal. Paul did not, however, reject the body—as did, for instance, the gnostics—but rather promoted a system whereby the body had its place, albeit subordinated to the spirit. Paul's anthropological dualism was matched by a hermeneutical dualism as well. Just as the human being is divided into a fleshy and a spiritual component, so also is language itself. It is composed of outer, material signs and inner, spiritual significations. When this is applied to the religious system that Paul inherited, the physical, fleshy signs of the Torah, of historical Judaism, are re-interpreted as symbols of that which Paul takes to be universal requirements and possibilities for humanity.\"\n  80. **Jump up ^** Boyarin, Daniel (1994).

One of these was the Confessing Church, a Protestant denomination formed in May 1934, the year after Hitler became chancellor of Germany. One of its goals was to repeal the Nazi law \"which required that the civil service would be purged of all those who were either Jewish or of partly Jewish descent.\" Another was to help those \"who suffered through repressive laws, or violence.\" About 7,000 of the 17,000 Protestant clergy in Germany joined the Confessing Church. Much of their work has one unrecognized, but two who will never forget them are Max Krakauer and his wife. Sheltered in sixty-six houses and helped by more than eighty individuals who belonged to the Confessing Church, they owe them their lives. German Catholic churches went out of their way to protect Catholics of Jewish ancestry. More inclusive was the principled stand taken by Catholic Bishop Clemens Count von Galen of Munster. He publicly denounced the Nazi slaughter of Jews and actually succeeded in having the problem halted for a short time. ... Members of the Society of Friends—German Quakers working with organizations of Friends from other countries—were particularly successful in rescuing Jews. ... Jehovah's Witnesses, themselves targeted for concentration camps, also provided help to Jews.\"\n  144. **Jump up ^** Wigoder, Geoffrey (1988).

Missionaries such as the Southern Baptist Robert Lindsey noted that for Israeli Jews, the term _nozrim_ , \"Christians\" in Hebrew, meant, almost automatically, an alien, hostile religion. Because such a term made it nearly impossible to convince Jews that Christianity was their religion, missionaries sought a more neutral term, one that did not arouse negative feelings. They chose _Meshichyim_ , Messianic, to overcome the suspicion and antagonism of the term _nozrim_. _Meshichyim_ as a term also had the advantage of emphasizing messianism as a major component of the Christian evangelical belief that the missions and communities of Jewish converts to Christianity propagated. It conveyed the sense of a new, innovative religion rather that _[_[sic](/wiki/Sic \"Sic\") _]_ an old, unfavorable one. The term was used in reference to those Jews who accepted Jesus as their personal savior, and did not apply to Jews accepting Roman Catholicism who in Israel have called themselves Hebrew Christians. The term Messianic Judaism was adopted in the United States in the early 1970s by those converts to evangelical Christianity who advocated a more assertive attitude on the part of converts towards their Jewish roots and heritage.\"\n  161. **Jump up ^** [Cohn-Sherbok, Dan](/wiki/Dan_Cohn-Sherbok \"Dan Cohn-Sherbok\") (2000).

The rise of Messianic Judaism was, in many ways, a logical outcome of the ideology and rhetoric of the movement to evangelize the Jews as well as its early sponsorship of various forms of Hebrew Christian expressions. The missions have promoted the message that Jews who had embraced Christianity were not betraying their heritage or even their faith but were actually fulfilling their true Jewish selves by becoming Christians. The missions also promoted the dispensationalist idea that the Church equals the body of the true Christian believers and that Christians were defined by their acceptance of Jesus as their personal Savior and not by their affiliations with specific denominations and particular liturgies or modes of prayer. Missions had been using Jewish symbols in their buildings and literature and called their centers by Hebrew names such as Emanuel or Beth Sar Shalom. Similarly, the missions' publications featured Jewish religious symbols and practices such as the lighting of a menorah. Although missionaries to the Jews were alarmed when they first confronted the more assertive and independent movement of Messianic Judaism, it was they who were responsible for its conception and indirectly for its birth. The ideology, rhetoric, and symbols they had promoted for generations provided the background for the rise of a new movement that missionaries at first rejected as going too far but later accepted and even embraced.\"\n  163. **Jump up ^** [\"What are the Standards of the UMJC?\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20151020172143/http://www.umjc.org/what-are-the-standards-of-the-umjc/).
