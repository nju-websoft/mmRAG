The main methods of determining a winner in a tied game are the\novertime period (commonly referred to as **overtime**), the\n[shootout](/wiki/Penalty_shootout \"Penalty shootout\"), or a combination of\nboth. If league rules dictate a finite time in which overtime may be played,\nwith no penalty shoot-out to follow, the game's winning team may or may not be\nnecessarily determined.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Overtime periods\n    * 1.1 North American overtime\n    * 1.2 International overtime\n  * 2 Shootout\n    * 2.1 International shootouts\n    * 2.2 North American shootouts\n    * 2.3 Tactics\n  * 3 List of notable overtime games\n    * 3.1 NHL\n      * 3.1.1 Notable NHL playoff overtime games\n    * 3.2 Swedish hockey\n    * 3.3 KHL\n    * 3.4 Olympics – Men's Gold Medal Game\n    * 3.5 Olympics – Women's Gold Medal Game\n    * 3.6 Czech hockey\n    * 3.7 DEL\n    * 3.8 Norwegian hockey\n    * 3.9 Notable minor league, college and junior overtimes\n      * 3.9.1 AHL\n      * 3.9.2 Canadian Interuniversity Sport – men\n      * 3.9.3 Canadian Interuniversity Sport – women\n      * 3.9.4 ECHL\n      * 3.9.5 International Hockey League\n      * 3.9.6 VHL\n      * 3.9.7 NCAA\n      * 3.9.8 NCAA Women\n      * 3.9.9 Canadian Hockey League\n      * 3.9.10 2007 RBC Cup – Canadian Jr A Championship\n      * 3.9.11 OPJHL\n      * 3.9.12 GHJHL\n      * 3.9.13 High school\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Overtime\nperiods[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overtime periods\")]\n\n**Overtime periods** are extra [periods](/wiki/Ice_hockey#Periods_and_overtime\n\"Ice hockey\") beyond the third regulation period during a game, where normal\nhockey rules apply. Although in the past, full-length overtime periods were\nplayed, overtimes today are _[golden goal](/wiki/Golden_goal \"Golden goal\")_\n(a form of _[sudden death](/wiki/Sudden_death_\\(sport\\) \"Sudden death\n\\(sport\\)\")_), meaning that the game ends immediately when a player scores a\n[goal](/wiki/Goal_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"Goal \\(ice hockey\\)\").\n\n### North American\novertime[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: North American overtime\")]\n\nFrom November 21, 1942,[1] when overtime was eliminated due to war time\nrestrictions and continuing until the\n[1983–84](/wiki/1983%E2%80%9384_NHL_season \"1983–84 NHL season\") season, all\n[NHL](/wiki/National_Hockey_League \"National Hockey League\") regular-season\ngames tied after 60 minutes of play ended as ties. On June 23, 1983, the NHL\nintroduced a regular-season overtime period of five minutes. If the five-\nminute overtime period ended with no scoring, the game ended as a tie (the\nWorld Hockey Association had used a 10-minute regular season overtime period,\nas had the NHL prior to World War II). In the first games to go to overtime,\non October 5, 1983, the Minnesota North Stars and Los Angeles Kings skated to\na 3–3 tie, and the Detroit Red Wings and Winnipeg Jets tied 6–6. The first\nregular-season game decided by overtime was on October 8, 1983, as the New\nYork Islanders beat the Washington Capitals 8–7.[2]\n\nIn [1987–88](/wiki/1987%E2%80%9388_AHL_season \"1987–88 AHL season\") and since\n[1995](/wiki/1995%E2%80%9396_AHL_season \"1995–96 AHL season\"), the [American\nHockey League](/wiki/American_Hockey_League \"American Hockey League\") has\nawarded teams one point in the standings for an overtime loss (OTL). In 1998,\nthe AHL introduced a rule where teams will play the five-minute overtime\nperiod with four skaters and a goaltender, rather than at full strength (five\nskaters), except in two-man advantage situations. In a two-man advantage\nsituation, the team with the advantage will play with five skaters against\nthree skaters. The rule was popular and adopted by the NHL and\n[ECHL](/wiki/ECHL \"ECHL\") the next season.\n\n[Alex Ovechkin](/wiki/Alexander_Ovechkin \"Alexander Ovechkin\") has the record\nfor most NHL overtime goals with 20.\n\nIn the [Stanley Cup playoffs](/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"Stanley Cup\nplayoffs\") and in all [one-game playoffs](/wiki/One-game_playoff \"One-game\nplayoff\"), overtime periods are played like regulation periods except for the\n[golden goal](/wiki/Golden_goal \"Golden goal\") rule – in an overtime period,\nthe game ends when one team scores a goal; the teams are at full strength\n(five skaters, barring penalties), there is no shootout, and each overtime\nperiod is 20 minutes with full intermissions between overtime periods. Three\nof the game's legendary players, [Mark Messier](/wiki/Mark_Messier \"Mark\nMessier\") (109 playoff goals), [Mario Lemieux](/wiki/Mario_Lemieux \"Mario\nLemieux\") (77 goals), and [Gordie Howe](/wiki/Gordie_Howe \"Gordie Howe\") (68\ngoals) never scored a playoff overtime goal.\n\nIn many leagues (including the NHL for regular-season games since the [2005–06\nseason](/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_NHL_season \"2005–06 NHL season\")) and in\ninternational competitions, a failure to reach a decision in a single overtime\nmay lead to a shootout. Some leagues may eschew overtime periods altogether\nand end games in shootout should teams be tied at the end of regulation. In\nthe [ECHL](/wiki/ECHL \"ECHL\"), regular season overtime periods are played four\non four for one five-minute period. In the [Southern Professional Hockey\nLeague](/wiki/Southern_Professional_Hockey_League \"Southern Professional\nHockey League\"), regular season overtime periods are played three on three for\none five-minute period, with penalties resulting in the opponents skating one\nadditional player on ice (up to two additional players) for the penalty for\nthe first three minutes, and a penalty shot in the final two minutes. The AHL,\nsince the [2014–15 season](/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_AHL_season \"2014–15 AHL\nseason\"), extended the overtime to seven minutes, with the last three minutes\nreduced further to three men aside and teams getting an additional skater for\neach opponent's penalty.[3] The idea of using 3-on-3 skaters for the entirety\nof a five-minute overtime period for a regular season game was adopted by the\nNHL on June 24, 2015, for use in the [2015–16 NHL\nseason](/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_NHL_season \"2015–16 NHL season\").[4]\n\n### International\novertime[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: International overtime\")]\n\nIn IIHF play, rules for overtime depend on the stage of the competition. For a\nround robin or preliminary round game that goes to overtime, the teams will\nplay a maximum of five minutes of 3-on-3 hockey in the \"golden goal\" format.\nIf no one scores in the five minute overtime, a three-round shootout will\ndecide the winner. In the case of a playoff game or a bronze medal game, the\nteams will play a maximum of ten minutes of 4-on-4 hockey in the \"golden goal\"\nformat. If there is no score in the overtime, a five-round shootout will\ndecide the winner. If the gold medal game of a top category IIHF championship\ngoes to overtime, the teams will play a maximum of twenty minutes of 5-on-5\nhockey in the \"golden goal\" format. If there is no winner after the overtime,\na five-round shootout will decide the winner. In all cases, the teams must\nchange ends, and defend the same side that they did in the second period.[5]\n\n##\nShootout[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Shootout\")]\n\n### International\nshootouts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: International shootouts\")]\n\nIn international competition, **shootouts** (or more formally, **game-winning\nshots (GWS)** , and, in some European countries, **bullets,** or\n**bullits**[6][7]), are often used. Each coach selects three skaters from\ntheir team to take [penalty shots](/wiki/Penalty_shot_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"Penalty\nshot \\(ice hockey\\)\") one at a time against the opposing\n[goaltender](/wiki/Goaltender \"Goaltender\"), with teams alternating shots.\nEach team gets one shot per round. The winner is the team with more goals\nafter three rounds or the team that amasses an unreachable advantage before\nthen (ex. a team gains a two-goal lead with only one round left). If the\nshootout is tied after three rounds, tie-breaker rounds are played one at a\ntime (with each team taking one additional shot) until there is a winner.\n\nThe IIHF first adopted the game-winning-shot procedure in 1992 when a new\nplayoff procedure in the Winter Olympics and World Championships required a\nwinner for each game. At that time, the shootout was five rounds and only used\nfor knock-out games. In 2006, it was reduced to three rounds and used for all\ngames, eliminating the possibility of tied games at IIHF events. Tie-breaker\nrounds are still used as needed, and the same or new players can take the tie-\nbreak shots, which is also done in reverse order.[8] As of May 2016, all IIHF\npreliminary round games that are not decided by overtime, are decided by a\nthree-round shootout. However, all playoff, bronze medal games and gold medal\ngames of IIHF top level championships (especially the Olympics) are decided by\nfive round shootouts.[5]\n\n### North American\nshootouts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: North American shootouts\")]\n\nMost lower minor leagues (ECHL, Central, [UHL](/wiki/United_Hockey_League\n\"United Hockey League\")) have featured a shootout where, at the end of\nregulation, a shootout similar to the international tournament format is used.\n\nHowever, in 2000, the ECHL adopted the AHL's four-on-four overtime before the\nshootout.\n\nFor the [2004–05 AHL season](/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_AHL_season \"2004–05 AHL\nseason\"), the AHL adopted a five-man shootout, which was first used in that\nleague in 1986–87. The standard five-man shootout is used after four-on-four\novertime for all minor leagues in North America. The AHL switched to the NHL\nformatted three-man shootout for the 2014–15 season.[3]\n\nThe Central Collegiate Hockey Association added the shootout as of the 2008–09\nseason.\n\nFollowing the lead of minor leagues, as of the [2005–06\nseason](/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_NHL_season \"2005–06 NHL season\"), the NHL ends\nexhibition and regular season games still tied after a five-minute-length,\nthree-skaters-per-side overtime period (as of the [2015–16 NHL\nseason](/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_NHL_season \"2015–16 NHL season\") onwards) with a\nshootout. The NHL format is a three-round shootout with tiebreaker rounds as\nneeded. All skaters (except goalies) on a team's roster must shoot before any\nplayer can shoot a second time. On December 16, 2014 the longest shootout in\nNHL history went to 20 rounds before [Nick Bjugstad](/wiki/Nick_Bjugstad \"Nick\nBjugstad\") of the [Florida Panthers](/wiki/Florida_Panthers \"Florida\nPanthers\") scored to defeat the [Washington\nCapitals](/wiki/Washington_Capitals \"Washington Capitals\"); the previous\nrecord was 15 rounds.[9]\n\nThe shootout is not used in the playoffs for any North American league.\nInstead, full 20-minute overtime periods are played until [one team scores a\ngoal](/wiki/Golden_goal \"Golden goal\").\n\nIn the [National Hockey League](/wiki/National_Hockey_League \"National Hockey\nLeague\") and [American Hockey League](/wiki/American_Hockey_League \"American\nHockey League\") All-Star Skills Competitions, the competition ends in a\npenalty shootout known as the _Breakaway Relay_.\n\n###\nTactics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Tactics\")]\n\nTactics are very important during penalty shots and overtime shootouts for\nboth the shooter and the goalie. Both shooters and goalies commonly consult\ntheir teammates and coaches for advice on the opposing player's style of play.\nShooters often consider the goalie's strengths and weaknesses (such as a fast\nglove or stick [save](/wiki/Save_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"Save \\(ice hockey\\)\")),\npreferred goaltending style (such as [butterfly](/wiki/Butterfly_style\n\"Butterfly style\") or [stand-up](/wiki/Stand-up_style \"Stand-up style\")) and\nmethod of challenging the shooter. Goaltenders often consider the shooter's\nshot preference, expected angle of attack, a patented move a shooter commonly\nuses and even handedness of the shooter.\n\nMost shooters attempt to [out-deke](/wiki/Deke_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"Deke \\(ice\nhockey\\)\") the goalie in order to create a better scoring chance. Former\n[Detroit Red Wings](/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings \"Detroit Red Wings\") forward\n[Pavel Datsyuk](/wiki/Pavel_Datsyuk \"Pavel Datsyuk\") and [New York\nRangers](/wiki/New_York_Rangers \"New York Rangers\") forward [Martin St.\nLouis](/wiki/Martin_St._Louis \"Martin St. Louis\") are examples of players who\ncommonly use this tactic. However, it is not uncommon for a shooter to simply\nshoot for an opening without deking. This is commonly referred to as\n[sniping](/wiki/List_of_ice_hockey_terminology \"List of ice hockey\nterminology\"). This is most commonly performed when a goalie challenges a\nshooter by giving them an open hole (by keeping a glove, pad or stick out of\nposition or being out of sound goaltending position altogether to tempt the\nshooter to aim for the given opening). Former NHL forwards [Markus\nNäslund](/wiki/Markus_N%C3%A4slund \"Markus Näslund\") and [Brett\nHull](/wiki/Brett_Hull \"Brett Hull\") are two players commonly referred to as\n[snipers](/wiki/List_of_ice_hockey_terminology \"List of ice hockey\nterminology\"). Very rarely a shooter may take a [slapshot](/wiki/Slapshot\n\"Slapshot\") or [wrist shot](/wiki/Wrist_shot \"Wrist shot\") from the\n[point](/wiki/Point_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"Point \\(ice hockey\\)\") or top of the\n[slot](/wiki/Slot_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"Slot \\(ice hockey\\)\"). This is almost\nexclusively performed when a shooter either has a high level of confidence in\ntheir shot or they attempt to catch the goalie by surprise. Retired player\n[Brian Rolston](/wiki/Brian_Rolston \"Brian Rolston\"), [Detroit Red\nWings](/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings \"Detroit Red Wings\") winger [Todd\nBertuzzi](/wiki/Todd_Bertuzzi \"Todd Bertuzzi\"), [Philadelphia\nFlyers](/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers \"Philadelphia Flyers\") defenseman [Chris\nPronger](/wiki/Chris_Pronger \"Chris Pronger\"), and [Vancouver\nCanucks](/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks \"Vancouver Canucks\") winger [Daniel\nSedin](/wiki/Daniel_Sedin \"Daniel Sedin\") have all used this tactic with\nsuccess.\n\n## List of notable overtime\ngames[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: List of notable overtime games\")]\n\nThe [longest overtime game](/wiki/Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)#Norwegian_hockey\n\"Overtime \\(ice hockey\\)\") in history was an in Norwegian [GET-\nligaen](/wiki/GET-ligaen \"GET-ligaen\"). The game ended after 157:14 of\novertime, in the 8th overtime period.\n\n###\nNHL[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: NHL\")]\n\nThis is a list

overtime\ngames[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Overtime_\\(ice_hockey\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Notable NHL playoff overtime games\")]\n\n  * March 24, 1936: The [Detroit Red Wings](/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings \"Detroit Red Wings\")' [Mud Bruneteau](/wiki/Mud_Bruneteau \"Mud Bruneteau\") ends the longest Stanley Cup playoff game to date, scoring the game's only goal in a 1–0 victory over the [Montreal Maroons](/wiki/Montreal_Maroons \"Montreal Maroons\"). The goal comes at 16:30 of sextuple overtime for a total of 176:30 of game play. It is also the longest NHL ice hockey game ever played. The game is a mere 3:30 short of the equivalent of playing three games back-to-back-to-back.\n  * February 4, 1939: The [Boston Bruins](/wiki/Boston_Bruins \"Boston Bruins\")' [Mel Hill](/wiki/Mel_Hill \"Mel Hill\") scores his third overtime goal of the Bruins' Stanley Cup semi-final series against the [New York Rangers](/wiki/New_York_Rangers \"New York Rangers\"), setting an unsurpassed (as of now) NHL record for most overtime goals in a single playoff series, earning him the nickname thereafter of \"Sudden Death\" Hill. The series itself involves four overtime games, two of which go to triple overtime.\n  * April 23, 1950: [Pete Babando](/wiki/Pete_Babando \"Pete Babando\") scores at 8:31 of double overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 4–3 win in the seventh game of the [1950 Stanley Cup Finals](/wiki/1950_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"1950 Stanley Cup Finals\") over the New York Rangers. It is the first time that a seventh game of a Final series goes to overtime.\n  * April 21, 1951: [Bill Barilko](/wiki/Bill_Barilko \"Bill Barilko\") scores at 2:53 of overtime to give the [Toronto Maple Leafs](/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs \"Toronto Maple Leafs\") a 3–2 win in the fifth game of the [1951 Stanley Cup Finals](/wiki/1951_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"1951 Stanley Cup Finals\") over the [Montreal Canadiens](/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens \"Montreal Canadiens\"). All five games in the series need to have overtime to be decided.\n  * April 16, 1954: [Tony Leswick](/wiki/Tony_Leswick \"Tony Leswick\")'s shot hit Montreal Canadiens' defenceman [Doug Harvey](/wiki/Doug_Harvey_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"Doug Harvey \\(ice hockey\\)\")'s glove and went into the net at 4:20 of overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 2–1 win in the seventh game of the [1954 Stanley Cup Finals](/wiki/1954_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"1954 Stanley Cup Finals\") over the Canadiens. No seventh game of a Final series has gone to overtime since.\n  * April 23, 1964: [Bobby Baun](/wiki/Bobby_Baun \"Bobby Baun\") of the [Toronto Maple Leafs](/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs \"Toronto Maple Leafs\") nets a game winner against Detroit 1:43 into overtime in game six of the Finals to tie the series 3–all. The goal is notable because Baun broke his ankle earlier in the game. It was frozen and taped, and Baun returned to the ice to score the winning goal.\n  * May 10, 1970: One of the most indelible moments in sports history is the sight of [Bobby Orr](/wiki/Bobby_Orr \"Bobby Orr\")'s \"in flight\" goal that gave the Boston Bruins a 4–3 win and a four-game sweep of the [St. Louis Blues](/wiki/St._Louis_Blues \"St. Louis Blues\") in the Stanley Cup Finals.\n  * May 24, 1980: [Bob Nystrom](/wiki/Bob_Nystrom \"Bob Nystrom\") of the [New York Islanders](/wiki/New_York_Islanders \"New York Islanders\") scores the Stanley Cup clinching goal at 7:11 of overtime, beating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games for the title.\n  * April 14, 1981: After sitting on the bench for the entire game, [Mike Crombeen](/wiki/Mike_Crombeen \"Mike Crombeen\") scored the winning goal at 5:16 of double overtime to give the [St. Louis Blues](/wiki/St._Louis_Blues \"St. Louis Blues\") a 4-3 win over the [Pittsburgh Penguins](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh Penguins\").\n  * April 10, 1982: \"[Miracle on Manchester](/wiki/Miracle_on_Manchester \"Miracle on Manchester\")\" – Rookie [Daryl Evans](/wiki/Daryl_Evans \"Daryl Evans\") gives the [Los Angeles Kings](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings \"Los Angeles Kings\") a 6–5 win over the [Edmonton Oilers](/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers \"Edmonton Oilers\") at 2:35 of overtime. The Kings had trailed the Oilers 5–0 after the second period of game three of the Smythe Division Semi-final. This still remains the largest single game playoff comeback in NHL history.\n  * May 5, 1986: [Doug Wickenheiser](/wiki/Doug_Wickenheiser \"Doug Wickenheiser\")'s overtime goal gives the St. Louis Blues a 6–5 win over the [Calgary Flames](/wiki/Calgary_Flames \"Calgary Flames\") in game six of the Campbell Conference Final. The goal, known as the \"Monday Night Miracle\", caps a 5–2 comeback and makes it more impressive that the three goals needed to tie the game were scored in the last ten minutes of the third period.\n  * May 18, 1986: A [Brian Skrudland](/wiki/Brian_Skrudland \"Brian Skrudland\") goal ends the shortest overtime in NHL history at just nine seconds. The winning goal gives the Montreal Canadiens a 3–2 victory over the Calgary Flames in game two of the [1986 Stanley Cup Finals](/wiki/1986_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"1986 Stanley Cup Finals\").\n  * April 18, 1987: \"[Easter Epic](/wiki/Easter_Epic \"Easter Epic\")\" – [Pat LaFontaine](/wiki/Pat_LaFontaine \"Pat LaFontaine\") of [New York Islanders](/wiki/New_York_Islanders \"New York Islanders\") scores a goal against [Washington Capitals](/wiki/Washington_Capitals \"Washington Capitals\") at 8:47 of quadruple overtime which ends the longest game seven in NHL playoff history. Islanders goaltender [Kelly Hrudey](/wiki/Kelly_Hrudey \"Kelly Hrudey\") makes a record 73 saves.\n  * May 15, 1990: After hardly playing in overtime, [Petr Klima](/wiki/Petr_Kl%C3%ADma \"Petr Klíma\") came off the bench late in triple overtime and scored almost immediately to end the longest overtime in NHL Finals history, with 4:47 left. The goal gave the Edmonton Oilers a 3–2 victory over the Boston Bruins to open the [1990 Stanley Cup Finals](/wiki/1990_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"1990 Stanley Cup Finals\"), setting the stage for the Oilers' fifth cup in seven years.\n  * April 24, 1993: In game four of the Adams division semi-final between the [Buffalo Sabres](/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres \"Buffalo Sabres\") and the Boston Bruins, Sabres forward [Brad May](/wiki/Brad_May \"Brad May\") scores in overtime to give Buffalo a 6–5 win and sweep the Bruins in the series, four games to none. Due to Buffalo commentator [Rick Jeanneret](/wiki/Rick_Jeanneret \"Rick Jeanneret\")'s colorful play call when May scored, this game has been referred to in Buffalo as \"May Day\".\n  * April to June 1993: After losing in overtime of game one of the Adams division semi-final to the [Quebec Nordiques](/wiki/Quebec_Nordiques \"Quebec Nordiques\"), the Montreal Canadiens go on to win ten consecutive overtime games en route to winning the [Stanley Cup](/wiki/Stanley_Cup \"Stanley Cup\"). The Habs score another overtime winner the following year against the Boston Bruins, making it eleven consecutive playoff overtime wins.\n  * May 14, 1993: In game seven of the Patrick Division Finals, [David Volek](/wiki/David_Volek \"David Volek\") who spent most of the season as a healthy scratch, scored the series winning goal to give the [New York Islanders](/wiki/New_York_Islanders \"New York Islanders\") a 4-3 victory ending the [Pittsburgh Penguins](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh Penguins\") chances at a threepeat.\n  * April 27, 1994: [Dominik Hašek](/wiki/Dominik_Ha%C5%A1ek \"Dominik Hašek\") of the Buffalo Sabres stops all 70 shots produced by the [New Jersey Devils](/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils \"New Jersey Devils\") as [Dave Hannan](/wiki/Dave_Hannan \"Dave Hannan\") scores the lone goal over a sprawling [Martin Brodeur](/wiki/Martin_Brodeur \"Martin Brodeur\") at 5:43 of quadruple overtime in game six of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal matchup.\n  * April 30, 1994: [Pavel Bure](/wiki/Pavel_Bure \"Pavel Bure\") scores 2:20 into double overtime of the seventh game of the opening round of Vancouver's playoff series with Calgary. The win gives the [Vancouver Canucks](/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks \"Vancouver Canucks\") three consecutive overtime wins over the favored [Calgary Flames](/wiki/Calgary_Flames \"Calgary Flames\"), who squander a 3–1 series lead.\n  * May 27, 1994: [Stéphane Matteau](/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Matteau \"Stéphane Matteau\") scores the game-winning goal at 4:24 of double overtime with a wrap-around, beating [Martin Brodeur](/wiki/Martin_Brodeur \"Martin Brodeur\") and the New Jersey Devils in game seven, advancing the [New York Rangers](/wiki/New_York_Rangers \"New York Rangers\") to the Stanley Cup Finals (where they would ultimately win it for the first time since 1940). It is Matteau's second goal in double overtime periods of the series.\n  * April 24, 1996: [Petr Nedved](/wiki/Petr_Nedv%C4%9Bd \"Petr Nedvěd\") scores with 44.6 seconds remaining in quadruple overtime to give the [Pittsburgh Penguins](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh Penguins\") a 3–2 win over the [Washington Capitals](/wiki/Washington_Capitals \"Washington Capitals\") to tie their Eastern Conference quarter-final series at two games apiece.\n  * June 6, 1996: [Uwe Krupp](/wiki/Uwe_Krupp \"Uwe Krupp\") became the 12th player in NHL history to end the Stanley Cup Finals in overtime, scoring a goal at 4:31 of triple overtime, giving the [Colorado Avalanche](/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche \"Colorado Avalanche\") a 1–0 win and a sweep of the [Florida Panthers](/wiki/Florida_Panthers \"Florida Panthers\").\n  * June 19, 1999: [Brett Hull](/wiki/Brett_Hull \"Brett Hull\") scores with 5:09 left in triple overtime of game six to win the Stanley Cup for the [Dallas Stars](/wiki/Dallas_Stars \"Dallas Stars\") over the [Buffalo Sabres](/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres \"Buffalo Sabres\"). The goal is considered controversial by some fans due to disagreement on if the goal by Hull was legal or not. (see [1999 Stanley Cup Finals](/wiki/1999_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"1999 Stanley Cup Finals\")).\n  * May 5, 2000: [Keith Primeau](/wiki/Keith_Primeau \"Keith Primeau\") of the [Philadelphia Flyers](/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers \"Philadelphia Flyers\") put a shot over the left shoulder of [Pittsburgh Penguins](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh Penguins\") goaltender [Ron Tugnutt](/wiki/Ron_Tugnutt \"Ron Tugnutt\") with 7:59 left in quintuple overtime, ending the longest game since 1936.\n  * June 6, 2000: [Jason Arnott](/wiki/Jason_Arnott \"Jason Arnott\") scores on Dallas Stars' goalie [Ed Belfour](/wiki/Ed_Belfour \"Ed Belfour\") in double overtime of game six to give the New Jersey Devils their second Stanley Cup.\n  * April 12, 2007: [Roberto Luongo](/wiki/Roberto_Luongo \"Roberto Luongo\"), goaltender for the Vancouver Canucks, wins his first career playoff game while making 72 saves, one shy of Kelly Hrudey's record. The game is the sixth longest ever, going into quadruple overtime. [Henrik Sedin](/wiki/Henrik_Sedin \"Henrik Sedin\") scores the winning goal in the Western Quarterfinals, beating the Dallas Stars 5–4 in game 1. The game is Vancouver's longest in history, and the Star's second longest, behind their five-overtime loss to Anaheim in 2003.\n  * May 5, 2008: [Brenden Morrow](/wiki/Brenden_Morrow \"Brenden Morrow\") scores on [San Jose Sharks](/wiki/San_Jose_Sharks \"San Jose Sharks\") goalie [Evgeni Nabokov](/wiki/Evgeni_Nabokov \"Evgeni Nabokov\") at 9:03 of quadruple overtime in game six of the Western Conference Semi-final between the Sharks and Stars. The game sees an incredible goaltending duel as Nabokov makes 53 saves in the loss while [Marty Turco](/wiki/Marty_Turco \"Marty Turco\") of Dallas makes 61 saves for the win.\n  * June 6, 2008: In game five of the [2008 Stanley Cup Finals](/wiki/2008_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"2008 Stanley Cup Finals\"), the [Pittsburgh Penguins](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh Penguins\")' [Petr Sykora](/wiki/Petr_S%C3%BDkora \"Petr Sýkora\") told [Pierre Maguire](/wiki/Pierre_Maguire \"Pierre Maguire\") of [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\") that he would score the winning goal in overtime. At 9:57 of triple overtime, Sykora scored on Detroit Red Wings' goaltender [Chris Osgood](/wiki/Chris_Osgood \"Chris Osgood\") and sent the series back to Pittsburgh for game six.\n  * June 6, 2010: [Patrick Kane](/wiki/Patrick_Kane \"Patrick Kane\") of the [Chicago Blackhawks](/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks \"Chicago Blackhawks\") shoots a goal past [Philadelphia Flyers](/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers \"Philadelphia Flyers\") goalie [Michael Leighton](/wiki/Michael_Leighton \"Michael Leighton\") 4:10 into overtime of game six of the Stanley Cup Finals to give the Blackhawks a 4–3 win over the Flyers for their first Stanley Cup Championship since 1961.\n  * April 26, 2011: [Alexandre Burrows](/wiki/Alexandre_Burrows \"Alexandre Burrows\") of the [Vancouver Canucks](/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks \"Vancouver Canucks\") scored at 5:22 of overtime past [Corey Crawford](/wiki/Corey_Crawford \"Corey Crawford\") of the Chicago Blackhawks to win the series 4–3 and the game 2–1, sending the Canucks to the Western Conference Semifinals, avoiding squandering a 3–0 series lead and a 1–0 lead in game seven in the third period.\n  * June 6, 2011: Another Burrows goal ends the second-shortest overtime in NHL history at just eleven seconds. The winning goal gives the Vancouver Canucks a 3–2 victory over the Boston Bruins in game two of the Stanley Cup Finals.\n  * May 25, 2012: [Adam Henrique](/wiki/Adam_Henrique \"Adam Henrique\") of the New Jersey Devils scored at 1:03 into overtime past [Henrik Lundqvist](/wiki/Henrik_Lundqvist \"Henrik Lundqvist\") of the [New York Rangers](/wiki/New_York_Rangers \"New York Rangers\") in game six of the Eastern Conference Final to send the Devils to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 2003.\n  * May 13, 2013: [Patrice Bergeron](/wiki/Patrice_Bergeron \"Patrice Bergeron\") of the Boston Bruins scored at 6:05 of overtime past [James Reimer](/wiki/James_Reimer_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"James Reimer \\(ice hockey\\)\") of the Toronto Maple Leafs to win the series 4–3 and the game 5–4, to send the Bruins to the Conference Semifinals to face the Rangers. It also capped a historic comeback in a game seven, coming back from a three-goal deficit in the third period. With fifty–one seconds to go, they tied the game. The tying goal was also scored by Bergeron. The 2012–13 Boston Bruins became the first team in NHL history to do so in the [Stanley Cup playoffs](/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"Stanley Cup playoffs\").\n  * June 6, 2013: [Andrew Shaw](/wiki/Andrew_Shaw_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"Andrew Shaw \\(ice hockey\\)\") scored with 7:52 left in triple overtime as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the [Boston Bruins](/wiki/Boston_Bruins \"Boston Bruins\") 4-3 to open the Stanley Cup Finals, ending the fifth-longest game in Stanley Cup Finals history.\n  * June 13, 2014: [Alec Martinez](/wiki/Alec_Martinez \"Alec Martinez\") scored with 5:17 left in double overtime in game five of the [2014 Stanley Cup Finals](/wiki/2014_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"2014 Stanley Cup Finals\"), becoming the 16th player to win the Stanley Cup with an overtime goal as the [Los Angeles Kings](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings \"Los Angeles Kings\") beat the Rangers 3–2, clinching the title 4–1. He became the first player to score two series-clinching playoff overtime goals in the same season since [Martin Gelinas](/wiki/Martin_Gelinas \"Martin Gelinas\") in 2004; on June 1, he scored 5:47 into overtime to defeat the Chicago Blackhawks 5–4 in game seven of the Western Conference Finals.\n  * May 13, 2015: [Derek Stepan](/wiki/Derek_Stepan \"Derek Stepan\") scored with 8:36 left in the first overtime in game seven in the Eastern Conference Second Round against the [Washington Capitals](/wiki/Washington_Capitals \"Washington Capitals\") to send the [New York Rangers](/wiki/New_York_Rangers \"New York Rangers\") to the Eastern Conference Finals. The Capitals also had a 3–1 series lead before losing the final three games and ultimately losing the series.\n  * May 19, 2015: [Marcus Kruger](/wiki/Marcus_Kr%C3%BCger \"Marcus Krüger\") scored with 3:48 left in the third overtime in game two of the Western Conference Finals, as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the [Anaheim Ducks](/wiki/Anaheim_Ducks \"Anaheim Ducks\"), 3–2, tying the series at 1–1.
