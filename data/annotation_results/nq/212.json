        "# Accounting Standards Codification\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\n[![Stub icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Accountancy_template.svg/40px-Accountancy_template.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Accountancy_template.svg) | _This[accounting](/wiki/Accounting \"Accounting\")-related article is a [stub](/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub \"Wikipedia:Stub\"). You can help Wikipedia by [expanding it](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Accounting_Standards_Codification&action=edit)._\n\n  * [v](/wiki/Template:Accounting-stub \"Template:Accounting-stub\")\n  * [t](/wiki/Template_talk:Accounting-stub \"Template talk:Accounting-stub\")\n  * [e](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Accounting-stub&action=edit)\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \nIn [US](/wiki/US \"US\") [accounting](/wiki/Accounting \"Accounting\") practices,\nthe Accounting Standards Codification is the current single source of United\nStates [Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples](/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles \"Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles\") (GAAP). It is maintained by the [Financial Accounting\nStandards Board](/wiki/Financial_Accounting_Standards_Board \"Financial\nAccounting Standards Board\") (FASB).\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 FASB accounting standards codification\n  * 2 Goal\n  * 3 Leading up to the codification process\n  * 4 Public access to codification\n  * 5 Structure\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## FASB accounting standards\ncodification[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Accounting_Standards_Codification&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: FASB accounting standards codification\")]\n\nThe codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after\nSeptember 15, 2009. All prior accounting standards documents were superseded\nas described in FASB Statement No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards\nCodification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\nAccounting literature not included in the Codification is non-authoritative.\n\nThe Codification reorganizes the thousands of U.S. GAAP pronouncements into\nroughly 90 accounting topics and displays all topics using a consistent\nstructure. It also includes relevant [U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission](/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission \"U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission\") (SEC) guidance that follows the same topical structure\nin separate sections in the Codification.\n\nTo prepare constituents for the change, the FASB provided a number of tools\nand training resources.[1]\n\nThe Codification did not change GAAP, but it introduced a new structure,\norganized in an easily accessible, user-friendly online research system. The\nFASB expected the system to reduce the amount of time and effort required to\nresearch accounting issues, mitigate the risk of noncompliance with standards\nthrough improved usability of the literature, provide accurate information\nwith real-time updates as new standards are released, and assist the FASB with\nthe research efforts required during the standard-setting process.[2]\n\n##\nGoal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Accounting_Standards_Codification&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Goal\")]\n\nThe three primary goals of the codification are \"simplify user access by\ncodifying all authoritative U.S. GAAP in one spot, ensure that the\ncodification content accurately represented authoritative U.S. GAAP as of July\n1, 2009, and to create a codification research system that is up to date for\nthe released results of standard-setting activity.\"[2] The codification was\nmade to make accounting standards easier to find through a single data base.\n\n## Leading up to the codification\nprocess[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Accounting_Standards_Codification&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Leading up to the codification process\")]\n\nBefore the Codification, accounting standards lacked a consistent and logical\nstructure. For the last 50 years, U.S. GAAP consisted of thousands of\nstandards with multiple standard setters. The old U.S. GAAP were difficult to\ninterpret, and the complexity of the standards made it hard for users to stay\nup to date. Problems with the old standards increased financial reporting risk\nand led to inefficiencies that increased cost. FASAC then voiced its concerns\ndue to the increase of financial reporting guidance from the old U.S. GAAP\nstandards, and the FASB responded by launching a new project to codify the\nstandards. The project was approved in September 2004 by the Trustees of the\nFinancial Accounting Foundation.[2]\n\n## Public access to\ncodification[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Accounting_Standards_Codification&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Public access to codification\")]\n\nAll users must register to view any codification information. The codification\nallows a free basic view or paid professional view to the public. The\nprofessional view requires an annual subcription up to $940 depending on\nconcurrent users. [3] Discounts may apply to multiple concurrent users. [4]The\ncodification is used by accounting and reporting professionals, analysts and\ninvestors.\n\n##\nStructure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Accounting_Standards_Codification&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Structure\")]\n\nEach ASC reference is structured as a series of four numbers separated by\nhyphens: a three-digit Topic (the first digit of which represents an Area), a\ntwo-digit Subtopic, a two-digit Section, and a two- or three-digit Paragraph.\n[5]\n\nTopic Series | Area  \n---|---  \n100 | General Principles  \n200 | Presentation  \n300 | Assets  \n400 | Liabilities  \n500 | Equity  \n600 | Revenue  \n700 | Expenses  \n800 | Broad Transactions  \n900 | Industry  \n  \nSubtopic 10 is always \"Overall.\"\n\nSection numbers are standardized across topics (not all subtopics have all\nsections):\n\nSection number | Section title  \n---|---  \n00 | Status  \n05 | Overview and Background  \n10 | Objectives  \n15 | Scope and Scope Exceptions  \n20 | Glossary  \n25 | Recognition  \n30 | Initial Measurement  \n35 | Subsequent Measurement  \n40 | Derecognition  \n45 | Other Presentation Matters  \n50 | Disclosure  \n55 | Implementation Guidance and Illustrations  \n60 | Relationships  \n65 | Transition and Open Effective Date Information  \n70 | Grandfathered Guidance  \n75 | XBRL Elements  \n  \nFor instance, 210-10-20 is Balance Sheet, Overall, Glossary. 605-40-25-1 is\nRevenue Recognition, Gains and Losses, Recognition, first paragraph.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Accounting_Standards_Codification&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of FASB pronouncements](/wiki/List_of_FASB_pronouncements \"List of FASB pronouncements\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Accounting_Standards_Codification&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Financial Accounting Standards Board.
