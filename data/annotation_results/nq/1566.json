        "# List of largest sports contracts\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe following is a **list of the largest sports contracts**. These figures\ninclude [signing bonuses](/wiki/Signing_bonus \"Signing bonus\") but exclude\noptions, buyouts, and endorsement deals. This list does not reflect the\nhighest annual salaries or career earnings, only the largest contracts and\nthus is limited to athletes in [team sports](/wiki/Team_sports \"Team sports\")\nand [auto racing](/wiki/Auto_racing \"Auto racing\"). Athletes in [individual\nsports](/wiki/Individual_sport \"Individual sport\"), such as [golf](/wiki/Golf\n\"Golf\"), [tennis](/wiki/Tennis \"Tennis\"), and [boxing](/wiki/Boxing \"Boxing\")\nare not employed by a team and usually earn money primarily through event\nwinnings. This list also does not necessarily reflect actual money collected\nby the athletes, since some contracts are eventually terminated (usually due\nto an athlete either retiring or invoking their opt-out clause).\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Largest sports contracts\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 Notes\n  * 4 References\n\n## Largest
