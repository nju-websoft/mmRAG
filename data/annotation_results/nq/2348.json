This [plasma](/wiki/Plasma_\\(physics\\)\n\"Plasma \\(physics\\)\") consists of mostly [electrons](/wiki/Electron\n\"Electron\"), [protons](/wiki/Proton \"Proton\") and [alpha\nparticles](/wiki/Alpha_particle \"Alpha particle\") with [kinetic\nenergy](/wiki/Kinetic_energy \"Kinetic energy\") between 0.5 and 10\n[keV](/wiki/Electronvolt \"Electronvolt\"). Embedded within the solar-wind\nplasma is the [interplanetary magnetic\nfield](/wiki/Interplanetary_magnetic_field \"Interplanetary magnetic\nfield\").[2] The solar wind varies in [density](/wiki/Density \"Density\"),\n[temperature](/wiki/Temperature \"Temperature\") and [speed](/wiki/Speed\n\"Speed\") over time and over solar latitude and longitude. Its particles can\nescape the Sun's [gravity](/wiki/Gravity \"Gravity\") because of their high\nenergy resulting from the high temperature of the corona, which in turn is a\nresult of the coronal magnetic field.\n\nAt a distance of more than a few solar radii from the Sun, the solar wind is\n[supersonic](/wiki/Supersonic \"Supersonic\") and reaches speeds of 250 to 750\nkilometers per second.[3] The flow of the solar wind is no longer supersonic\nat the [termination shock](/wiki/Termination_shock \"Termination shock\").

In [1859, Carrington and Richard Hodgson independently made the\nfirst observation](/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859 \"Solar storm of 1859\") of what\nwould later be called a [solar flare](/wiki/Solar_flare \"Solar flare\"). This\nis a sudden, localised increase in brightness on the solar disc, which is now\nknown[7] to often occur in conjunction with an episodic ejection of material\nand magnetic flux from the Sun's atmosphere, known as a [coronal mass\nejection](/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection \"Coronal mass ejection\"). On the\nfollowing day, a [geomagnetic storm](/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm \"Geomagnetic\nstorm\") was observed, and Carrington suspected that there might be a\nconnection, which is now attributed to the arrival of the coronal mass\nejection in near-Earth space and its subsequent interaction with the Earth's\nmagnetosphere. [George FitzGerald](/wiki/George_Francis_FitzGerald \"George\nFrancis FitzGerald\") later suggested that matter was being regularly\naccelerated away from the Sun and was reaching the Earth after several\ndays.[8]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Birkeland-anode-\nglobe-fig259.jpg/250px-Birkeland-anode-globe-\nfig259.jpg)](/wiki/File:Birkeland-anode-globe-fig259.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Birkeland-anode-globe-fig259.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLaboratory simulation of the magnetosphere's influence on the Solar Wind;\nthese auroral-like [Birkeland currents](/wiki/Birkeland_current \"Birkeland\ncurrent\") were created in a [terrella](/wiki/Terrella \"Terrella\"), a\nmagnetised anode globe in an evacuated chamber.\n\nIn 1910 British astrophysicist [Arthur Eddington](/wiki/Arthur_Eddington\n\"Arthur Eddington\") essentially suggested the existence of the solar wind,\nwithout naming it, in a footnote to an article on [Comet\nMorehouse](/wiki/Comet_Morehouse \"Comet Morehouse\").[9] The idea never fully\ncaught on even though Eddington had also made a similar suggestion at a Royal\nInstitution address the previous year. In the latter case, he postulated that\nthe ejected material consisted of electrons while in his study of Comet\nMorehouse he supposed them to be [ions](/wiki/Ion \"Ion\").[9]\n\nThe first person to suggest that the ejected material consisted of both ions\nand electrons was [Kristian Birkeland](/wiki/Kristian_Birkeland \"Kristian\nBirkeland\").[10] His geomagnetic surveys showed that auroral activity was\nnearly uninterrupted. As these displays and other geomagnetic activity were\nbeing produced by particles from the Sun, he concluded that the Earth was\nbeing continually bombarded by \"rays of electric corpuscles emitted by the\nSun\".[8] In 1916, Birkeland proposed that, \"From a physical point of view it\nis most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive\nrays, but of both kinds\". In other words, the solar wind consists of both\nnegative electrons and positive [ions](/wiki/Ions \"Ions\").[11] Three years\nlater in 1919, [Frederick Lindemann](/wiki/Frederick_Lindemann \"Frederick\nLindemann\") also suggested that particles of both polarities, protons as well\nas electrons, come from the Sun.[12]\n\nAround the 1930s, scientists had determined that the temperature of the solar\n[corona](/wiki/Corona \"Corona\") must be a million degrees\n[Celsius](/wiki/Anders_Celsius \"Anders Celsius\") because of the way it stood\nout into space (as seen during total eclipses). Later spectroscopic work\nconfirmed this extraordinary temperature. In the mid-1950s [Sydney\nChapman](/wiki/Sydney_Chapman_\\(astronomer\\) \"Sydney Chapman \\(astronomer\\)\")\ncalculated the properties of a gas at such a temperature and determined it was\nsuch a superb conductor of heat that it must extend way out into space, beyond\nthe orbit of Earth. Also in the 1950s, [Ludwig Biermann](/wiki/Ludwig_Biermann\n\"Ludwig Biermann\") became interested in the fact that no matter whether a\n[comet](/wiki/Comet \"Comet\") is headed towards or away from the Sun, its tail\nalways points away from the Sun. Biermann postulated that this happens because\nthe Sun emits a steady stream of particles that pushes the comet's tail\naway.[13] Wilfried Schröder claimed that [Paul\nAhnert](/wiki/Paul_Oswald_Ahnert \"Paul Oswald Ahnert\") was the first to relate\nsolar wind to comet tail direction based on observations of the comet Whipple-\nFedke (1942g).[14]\n\n[Eugene Parker](/wiki/Eugene_Parker \"Eugene Parker\") realised heat flowing\nfrom the Sun in Chapman's model and the comet tail blowing away from the Sun\nin Biermann's hypothesis had to be the result of the same phenomenon, which he\ntermed the \"solar wind\".[15][16] In 1957, Parker showed, even though the Sun's\ncorona is strongly attracted by solar gravity, it is such a good heat\nconductor that it is still very hot at large distances. Since gravity weakens\nas distance from the Sun increases, the outer coronal atmosphere escapes\nsupersonically into interstellar space. Furthermore, Parker was the first\nperson to notice that the weakening effect of the gravity has the same effect\non [hydrodynamic](/wiki/Hydrodynamic \"Hydrodynamic\") flow as a [de Laval\nnozzle](/wiki/De_Laval_nozzle \"De Laval nozzle\"): it incites a transition from\n[subsonic](/wiki/Speed_of_sound \"Speed of sound\") to\n[supersonic](/wiki/Supersonic \"Supersonic\") flow.[17]\n\nOpposition to Parker's hypothesis on the solar wind was strong. The paper he\nsubmitted to _[The Astrophysical Journal](/wiki/The_Astrophysical_Journal \"The\nAstrophysical Journal\")_ in 1958 was rejected by two reviewers. It was saved\nby the editor [Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar\n\"Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar\").\n\nIn January 1959, the [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") spacecraft\n_[Luna 1](/wiki/Luna_1 \"Luna 1\")_ first directly observed the solar wind and\nmeasured its strength,[18][19][20] using hemispherical ion traps. The\ndiscovery, made by Konstantin Gringauz, was verified by _[Luna 2](/wiki/Luna_2\n\"Luna 2\")_ , _[Luna 3](/wiki/Luna_3 \"Luna 3\")_ and by the more distant\nmeasurements of _[Venera 1](/wiki/Venera_1 \"Venera 1\")_. Three years later a\nsimilar measurement was performed by Neugebauer and collaborators using the\n_[Mariner 2](/wiki/Mariner_2 \"Mariner 2\")_ spacecraft.[21]\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer (UVCS) instrument on\nboard the [SOHO](/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory \"Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory\") spacecraft observed the acceleration region of the\nfast solar wind emanating from the poles of the Sun and found that the wind\naccelerates much faster than can be accounted for by thermodynamic expansion\nalone. Parker's model predicted that the wind should make the transition to\nsupersonic flow at an altitude of about 4 solar radii from the\n[photosphere](/wiki/Photosphere \"Photosphere\") (surface); but the transition\n(or \"sonic point\") now appears to be much lower, perhaps only 1 solar radius\nabove the photosphere, suggesting that some additional mechanism accelerates\nthe solar wind away from the Sun. The acceleration of the fast wind is still\nnot understood and cannot be fully explained by Parker's theory. The\ngravitational and electromagnetic explanation for this acceleration is,\nhowever, detailed in an earlier paper by 1970 [Nobel\nlaureate](/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates \"List of Nobel laureates\") for\n[Physics](/wiki/Physics \"Physics\"), [Hannes Alfvén](/wiki/Hannes_Alfv%C3%A9n\n\"Hannes Alfvén\").[22][23]\n\nThe first numerical simulation of the solar wind in the solar\n[corona](/wiki/Corona \"Corona\") including [closed and open field\nlines](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\") was performed by Pneuman and\nKopp in 1971. The [magnetohydrodynamics](/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics\n\"Magnetohydrodynamics\") equations in [steady state](/wiki/Steady_state \"Steady\nstate\") were solved iteratively starting with an initial\n[dipolar](/wiki/Dipole \"Dipole\") configuration.[24]\n\nIn 1990, the [_Ulysses_](/wiki/Ulysses_\\(spacecraft\\) \"Ulysses\n\\(spacecraft\\)\") probe was launched to study the solar wind from high solar\nlatitudes. All prior observations had been made at or near the Solar System's\n[ecliptic](/wiki/Ecliptic \"Ecliptic\") plane.[25]\n\nIn 2018, NASA launched the [Parker Solar Probe](/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe\n\"Parker Solar Probe\"), named in honor of Eugene Parker, on a mission to study\nthe structure and dynamics of the solar corona, in an attempt to understand\nthe mechanisms that cause particles to be heated and accelerated as solar\nwind. During its seven year mission, the probe will make twenty-four orbits of\nthe sun, passing further into the corona with each orbit's\n[perihelion](/wiki/Perihelion \"Perihelion\"), ultimately passing within 0.04\n[astronomical units](/wiki/Astronomical_units \"Astronomical units\") of the\nsun's surface. It is the first NASA spacecraft named for a living person, and\nParker himself, at age 91, was on hand to observe the launch.[26]\n\n## Acceleration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Acceleration\")]\n\nWhile early models of the solar wind relied primarily on\n[thermal](/wiki/Thermal \"Thermal\") energy to accelerate the material, by the\n1960s it was clear that thermal acceleration alone cannot account for the high\nspeed of solar wind. An additional unknown acceleration mechanism is required\nand likely relates to [magnetic fields](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\")\nin the solar atmosphere.\n\nThe Sun's [corona](/wiki/Corona \"Corona\"), or extended outer layer, is a\nregion of plasma that is heated to over a million [kelvin](/wiki/Kelvin\n\"Kelvin\"). As a result of thermal collisions, the particles within the inner\ncorona have a range and distribution of speeds described by a [Maxwellian\ndistribution](/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution \"Maxwell–Boltzmann\ndistribution\"). The mean velocity of these particles is about 145 km/s, which\nis well below the solar [escape velocity](/wiki/Escape_velocity \"Escape\nvelocity\") of 618 km/s. However, a few of the particles achieve energies\nsufficient to reach the terminal velocity of 400 km/s, which allows them to\nfeed the solar wind. At the same temperature, electrons, due to their much\nsmaller mass, reach escape velocity and build up an electric field that\nfurther accelerates ions away from the Sun.[27]\n\nThe total number of particles carried away from the Sun by the solar wind is\nabout 1.3×1036 per second.[28] Thus, the total mass loss each year is about\n(2–3)×10−14 [solar masses](/wiki/Solar_mass \"Solar mass\"),[29] or about\n(1.3–1.9) million tonnes per second. This is equivalent to losing a mass equal\nto the Earth every 150 million years.[30] However, only about 0.01% of the\nSun's total mass has been lost through the solar wind.[31] Other stars have\nmuch stronger [stellar winds](/wiki/Stellar_wind \"Stellar wind\") that result\nin significantly higher mass loss rates.\n\n## Properties and\nstructure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Properties and structure\")]\n\n### Fast and slow solar\nwind[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section:\nFast and slow solar wind\")]\n\nThe solar wind is observed to exist in two fundamental states, termed the slow\nsolar wind and the fast solar wind, though their differences extend well\nbeyond their speeds. In near-Earth space, the slow solar wind is observed to\nhave a velocity of 300–500 km/s, a temperature of 1.4–1.6×106 K and a\ncomposition that is a close match to the [corona](/wiki/Corona \"Corona\"). By\ncontrast, the fast solar wind has a typical velocity of 750 km/s, a\ntemperature of 8×105 K and it nearly matches the composition of the Sun's\n[photosphere](/wiki/Photosphere \"Photosphere\").[32] The slow solar wind is\ntwice as dense and more variable in nature than the fast solar wind.[28][33]\n\nThe slow solar wind appears to originate from a region around the Sun's\nequatorial belt that is known as the \"streamer belt\", where coronal streamers\nare produced by magnetic flux open to the heliosphere draping over closed\nmagnetic loops. The exact coronal structures involved in slow solar wind\nformation and the method by which the material is released is still under\ndebate.[34][35][36] Observations of the Sun between 1996 and 2001 showed that\nemission of the slow solar wind occurred at latitudes up to 30–35° during the\n[solar minimum](/wiki/Solar_minimum \"Solar minimum\") (the period of lowest\nsolar activity), then expanded toward the poles as the solar cycle approached\nmaximum. At [solar maximum](/wiki/Solar_maximum \"Solar maximum\"), the poles\nwere also emitting a slow solar wind.[1]\n\nThe fast solar wind originates from [coronal holes](/wiki/Coronal_hole\n\"Coronal hole\"),[37] which are funnel-like regions of open field lines in the\nSun's [magnetic field](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\").[38] Such open\nlines are particularly prevalent around the Sun's magnetic poles. The plasma\nsource is small magnetic fields created by [convection\ncells](/wiki/Convection_cell \"Convection cell\") in the solar atmosphere. These\nfields confine the plasma and transport it into the narrow necks of the\ncoronal funnels, which are located only 20,000 kilometers above the\nphotosphere. The plasma is released into the funnel when these magnetic field\nlines reconnect.[39]\n\n### Pressure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Pressure\")]\n\nThe wind exerts a pressure at 1 [AU](/wiki/Astronomical_unit \"Astronomical\nunit\") typically in the range of 1–6 nPa (1–6×10−9 N/m2), although it can\nreadily vary outside that range.\n\nThe [ram pressure](/wiki/Ram_pressure \"Ram pressure\") is a\n[function](/wiki/Function_\\(mathematics\\) \"Function \\(mathematics\\)\") of wind\nspeed and density. The formula is\n\nP = mp * n * V2= 1.6726×10−6 * n * V2\n\nwhere mp is the [proton](/wiki/Proton \"Proton\") mass, pressure P is in nPa\n(nanopascals), n is the density in particles/cm3 and V is the speed in km/s of\nthe solar wind.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_][40]\n\n### Coronal mass\nejection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Coronal mass ejection\")]\n\nMain article: [Coronal mass ejection](/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection \"Coronal\nmass ejection\")\n\nBoth the fast and slow solar wind can be interrupted by large, fast-moving\nbursts of plasma called [interplanetary coronal mass\nejections](/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection \"Coronal mass ejection\"), or ICMEs.\nICMEs are the interplanetary manifestation of solar [coronal mass\nejections](/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejections \"Coronal mass ejections\"), which are\ncaused by release of magnetic energy at the Sun. CMEs are often called \"solar\nstorms\" or \"space storms\" in the popular media. They are sometimes, but not\nalways, associated with [solar flares](/wiki/Solar_flare \"Solar flare\"), which\nare another manifestation of magnetic energy release at the Sun. ICMEs cause\nshock waves in the thin plasma of the heliosphere, launching electromagnetic\n[waves](/wiki/Wave \"Wave\") and accelerating particles (mostly\n[protons](/wiki/Proton \"Proton\") and [electrons](/wiki/Electrons \"Electrons\"))\nto form showers of [ionizing radiation](/wiki/Ionizing_radiation \"Ionizing\nradiation\") that precede the CME.\n\nWhen a CME impacts the Earth's [magnetosphere](/wiki/Magnetosphere\n\"Magnetosphere\"), it temporarily deforms the Earth's [magnetic\nfield](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\"), changing the direction of\n[compass](/wiki/Compass \"Compass\") needles and inducing large electrical\nground currents in Earth itself; this is called a [geomagnetic\nstorm](/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm \"Geomagnetic storm\") and it is a global\nphenomenon. CME impacts can induce [magnetic\nreconnection](/wiki/Magnetic_reconnection \"Magnetic reconnection\") in Earth's\n[magnetotail](/wiki/Magnetosphere#Magnetic_tails \"Magnetosphere\") (the\nmidnight side of the [magnetosphere](/wiki/Magnetosphere \"Magnetosphere\"));\nthis launches protons and electrons downward toward Earth's atmosphere, where\nthey form the [aurora](/wiki/Aurora_\\(phenomenon\\) \"Aurora \\(phenomenon\\)\").\n\nICMEs are not the only cause of [space weather](/wiki/Space_weather \"Space\nweather\"). Different patches on the Sun are known to give rise to slightly\ndifferent speeds and densities of wind depending on local conditions. In\nisolation, each of these different wind streams would form a spiral with a\nslightly different angle, with fast-moving streams moving out more directly\nand slow-moving streams wrapping more around the Sun. Fast moving streams tend\nto overtake slower streams that originate [westward](/wiki/West \"West\") of\nthem on the Sun, forming turbulent co-rotating interaction regions that give\nrise to wave motions and accelerated particles, and that affect Earth's\nmagnetosphere in the same way as, but more gently than, CMEs.\n\n## Solar System\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Solar System effects\")]\n\nMain article: [Space weather](/wiki/Space_weather \"Space weather\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Heliospheric-current-\nsheet.gif/250px-Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif)](/wiki/File:Heliospheric-\ncurrent-sheet.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [heliospheric current sheet](/wiki/Heliospheric_current_sheet\n\"Heliospheric current sheet\") results from the influence of the Sun's rotating\nmagnetic field on the plasma in the solar wind\n\nOver the Sun's lifetime, the interaction of its surface layers with the\nescaping solar wind has significantly decreased its surface rotation rate.[41]\nThe wind is considered responsible for comets' tails, along with the Sun's\nradiation.[42] The solar wind contributes to fluctuations in\n[celestial](/wiki/Sky \"Sky\") [radio waves](/wiki/Radio_wave \"Radio wave\")\nobserved on the Earth, through an effect called [interplanetary\nscintillation](/wiki/Interplanetary_scintillation \"Interplanetary\nscintillation\").[43]\n\n### Magnetospheres[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Magnetospheres\")]\n\nMain article: [Magnetosphere](/wiki/Magnetosphere \"Magnetosphere\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Structure_of_the_magnetosphere-\nen.svg/330px-Structure_of_the_magnetosphere-\nen.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere-en.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere-en.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSchematic of Earth's [magnetosphere](/wiki/Magnetosphere \"Magnetosphere\"). The\nsolar wind flows from left to right.\n\nWhere the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well-developed\n[magnetic field](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\") (such as Earth,\nJupiter or Saturn), the particles are deflected by the [Lorentz\nforce](/wiki/Lorentz_force \"Lorentz force\"). This region, known as the\n[magnetosphere](/wiki/Magnetosphere \"Magnetosphere\"), causes the particles to\ntravel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface. The\nmagnetosphere is roughly shaped like a [hemisphere](/wiki/Sphere \"Sphere\") on\nthe side facing the Sun, then is drawn out in a long wake on the opposite\nside. The boundary of this region is called the\n[magnetopause](/wiki/Magnetopause \"Magnetopause\"), and some of the particles\nare able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by partial\nreconnection of the magnetic field lines.[27]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Solar_Wind_and_Earth%27s_magnetic_field.png/220px-\nSolar_Wind_and_Earth%27s_magnetic_field.png)](/wiki/File:Solar_Wind_and_Earth%27s_magnetic_field.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Solar_Wind_and_Earth%27s_magnetic_field.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nNoon meridian section of magnetosphere\n\nThe solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of Earth's magnetosphere.\nFluctuations in its speed, density, direction, and [entrained magnetic\nfield](/wiki/Interplanetary_magnetic_field \"Interplanetary magnetic field\")\nstrongly affect Earth's local space environment. For example, the levels of\nionizing radiation and radio interference can vary by factors of hundreds to\nthousands; and the shape and location of the magnetopause and bow [shock\nwave](/wiki/Shock_wave \"Shock wave\") upstream of it can change by several\nEarth radii, exposing [geosynchronous](/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit\n\"Geosynchronous orbit\") satellites to the direct solar wind. These phenomena\nare collectively called [space weather](/wiki/Space_weather \"Space weather\").\n\nFrom the [European Space Agency](/wiki/European_Space_Agency \"European Space\nAgency\")'s [Cluster](/wiki/Cluster_II_\\(spacecraft\\) \"Cluster II\n\\(spacecraft\\)\") mission, a new study has taken place that proposes that it is\neasier for the solar wind to infiltrate the magnetosphere than previously\nbelieved. A group of scientists directly observed the existence of certain\nwaves in the solar wind that were not expected. A recent study shows that\nthese waves enable incoming charged particles of solar wind to breach the\nmagnetopause. This suggests that the magnetic bubble forms more as a filter\nthan a continuous barrier. This latest discovery occurred through the\ndistinctive arrangement of the four identical Cluster spacecraft, which fly in\na controlled configuration through near-Earth space. As they sweep from the\nmagnetosphere into interplanetary space and back again, the fleet provides\nexceptional three-dimensional insights on the phenomena that connect the sun\nto Earth.\n\nThe research characterised variances in formation of the [interplanetary\nmagnetic field](/wiki/Interplanetary_magnetic_field \"Interplanetary magnetic\nfield\") (IMF) largely influenced by [Kelvin–Helmholtz\ninstability](/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_instability \"Kelvin–Helmholtz\ninstability\") (which occur at the interface of two fluids) as a result of\ndifferences in thickness and numerous other characteristics of the boundary\nlayer. Experts believe that this was the first occasion that the appearance of\nKelvin-Helmholtz waves at the magnetopause had been displayed at high latitude\ndawnward orientation of the IMF. These waves are being seen in unforeseen\nplaces under solar wind conditions that were formerly believed to be undesired\nfor their generation. These discoveries show how Earth's magnetosphere can be\npenetrated by solar particles under specific IMF circumstances. The findings\nare also relevant to studies of magnetospheric progressions around other\nplanetary bodies. This study suggests that Kelvin-Helmholtz waves can be a\nsomewhat common, and possibly constant, instrument for the entrance of solar\nwind into terrestrial magnetospheres under various IMF orientations.[44]\n\n### Atmospheres[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Atmospheres\")]\n\nThe solar wind affects other incoming [cosmic rays](/wiki/Cosmic_ray \"Cosmic\nray\") interacting with planetary atmospheres. Moreover, planets with a weak or\nnon-existent magnetosphere are subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar\nwind.\n\n[Venus](/wiki/Venus \"Venus\"), the nearest and most similar planet to Earth,\nhas 100 times denser atmosphere, with little or no geo-magnetic field. Space\nprobes discovered a comet-like tail that extends to Earth's orbit.[45]\n\nEarth itself is largely protected from the solar wind by [its magnetic\nfield](/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field \"Earth's magnetic field\"), which\ndeflects most of the charged particles; however some of the charged particles\nare trapped in the [Van Allen radiation belt](/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt\n\"Van Allen radiation belt\"). A smaller number of particles from the solar wind\nmanage to travel, as though on an electromagnetic energy transmission line, to\nthe Earth's upper atmosphere and [ionosphere](/wiki/Ionosphere \"Ionosphere\")\nin the auroral zones. The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth\nis when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the\n[aurora](/wiki/Aurora_\\(astronomy\\) \"Aurora \\(astronomy\\)\") and [geomagnetic\nstorms](/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm \"Geomagnetic storm\"). Bright auroras strongly\nheat the ionosphere, causing its plasma to expand into the magnetosphere,\nincreasing the size of the plasma [geosphere](/wiki/Geosphere \"Geosphere\") and\ninjecting atmospheric matter into the solar wind. [Geomagnetic\nstorms](/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm \"Geomagnetic storm\") result when the pressure\nof plasmas contained inside the magnetosphere is sufficiently large to inflate\nand thereby distort the geomagnetic field.\n\nAlthough [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\") is larger than Mercury and four times\nfarther from the Sun, it is thought that the solar wind has stripped away up\nto a third of its original atmosphere, leaving a layer 1/100th as dense as the\nEarth's. It is believed the mechanism for this atmospheric stripping is gas\ncaught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.[46]\nIn 2015 the NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution ([MAVEN](/wiki/MAVEN\n\"MAVEN\")) mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping caused by the\nmagnetic field carried by the solar wind as it flows past Mars, which\ngenerates an electric field, much as a turbine on Earth can be used to\ngenerate electricity. This electric field accelerates electrically charged gas\natoms, called ions, in Mars' upper atmosphere and shoots them into space.[47]\nThe MAVEN mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping at about 100\ngrams (≈1/4 lb) per second.[48]\n\n### Moons and planetary\nsurfaces[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Moons and planetary surfaces\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Aldrin_Next_to_Solar_Wind_Experiment_-\n_GPN-2000-001211.jpg/170px-Aldrin_Next_to_Solar_Wind_Experiment_-\n_GPN-2000-001211.jpg)](/wiki/File:Aldrin_Next_to_Solar_Wind_Experiment_-\n_GPN-2000-001211.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Aldrin_Next_to_Solar_Wind_Experiment_-_GPN-2000-001211.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nApollo's [SWC](/wiki/Solar_Wind_Composition_Experiment \"Solar Wind Composition\nExperiment\") experiment\n\n[Mercury](/wiki/Mercury_\\(planet\\) \"Mercury \\(planet\\)\"), the nearest planet\nto the Sun, bears the full brunt of the solar wind, and since its atmosphere\nis vestigial and transient, its surface is bathed in radiation.\n\nMercury has an intrinsic magnetic field, so under normal solar wind\nconditions, the solar wind cannot penetrate its magnetosphere and particles\nonly reach the surface in the cusp regions. During coronal mass ejections,\nhowever, the magnetopause may get pressed into the surface of the planet, and\nunder these conditions, the solar wind may interact freely with the planetary\nsurface.\n\nThe Earth's [Moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\") has no atmosphere or intrinsic [magnetic\nfield](/wiki/Magnetosphere \"Magnetosphere\"), and consequently its surface is\nbombarded with the full solar wind. The [Project Apollo\nmissions](/wiki/Apollo_program \"Apollo program\") deployed passive aluminum\ncollectors in an attempt to sample the solar wind, and lunar soil returned for\nstudy confirmed that the lunar [regolith](/wiki/Regolith \"Regolith\") is\nenriched in atomic nuclei deposited from the solar wind. These elements may\nprove useful resources for lunar colonies.[49]\n\n## Outer limits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Outer limits\")]\n\nMain article: [Heliopause (astronomy)](/wiki/Heliopause_\\(astronomy\\)\n\"Heliopause \\(astronomy\\)\")\n\nThe solar wind \"blows a bubble\" in the [interstellar\nmedium](/wiki/Interstellar_medium \"Interstellar medium\") (the rarefied\nhydrogen and helium gas that permeates the galaxy). The point where the solar\nwind's strength is no longer great enough to push back the interstellar medium\nis known as the [heliopause](/wiki/Heliosphere \"Heliosphere\") and is often\nconsidered to be the outer border of the Solar System. The distance to the\nheliopause is not precisely known and probably depends on the current velocity\nof the solar wind and the local density of the interstellar medium, but it is\nfar outside [Pluto](/wiki/Pluto \"Pluto\")'s orbit. Scientists hope to gain\nperspective on the heliopause from data acquired through the [Interstellar\nBoundary Explorer](/wiki/Interstellar_Boundary_Explorer \"Interstellar Boundary\nExplorer\") (IBEX) mission, launched in October 2008.\n\n## Notable events[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Notable events\")]\n\n  * From May 10 to May 12, 1999, NASA's [Advanced Composition Explorer](/wiki/Advanced_Composition_Explorer \"Advanced Composition Explorer\") (ACE) and [WIND](/wiki/WIND_\\(spacecraft\\) \"WIND \\(spacecraft\\)\") spacecraft observed a 98% decrease of solar wind density. This allowed energetic electrons from the Sun to flow to Earth in narrow beams known as \"[strahl](/wiki/Strahl_\\(astronomy\\) \"Strahl \\(astronomy\\)\")\", which caused a highly unusual \"polar rain\" event, in which a visible [aurora](/wiki/Aurora_\\(astronomy\\) \"Aurora \\(astronomy\\)\") appeared over the North Pole. In addition, Earth's magnetosphere increased to between 5 and 6 times its normal size.[50]\n  * On 13 December 2010, _[Voyager 1](/wiki/Voyager_1 \"Voyager 1\")_ determined that the velocity of the solar wind, at its location 10.8 billion miles (17.4 billion km) from Earth had slowed to zero. \"We have gotten to the point where the wind from the Sun, which until now has always had an outward motion, is no longer moving outward; it is only moving sideways so that it can end up going down the tail of the heliosphere, which is a comet-shaped-like object,\" said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone.[51][52]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Earth-moon.jpg/32px-Earth-moon.jpg)[Space portal](/wiki/Portal:Space \"Portal:Space\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/He1523a.jpg/24px-He1523a.jpg)](/wiki/File:He1523a.jpg)[Star portal](/wiki/Portal:Star \"Portal:Star\")\n\n  * [Deep Space Climate Observatory](/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory \"Deep Space Climate Observatory\")\n  * [Dyson-Harrop satellite](/wiki/Dyson-Harrop_satellite \"Dyson-Harrop satellite\")\n  * [Electric sail](/wiki/Electric_sail \"Electric sail\")\n  * [Helium Focusing Cone](/wiki/Helium_Focusing_Cone \"Helium Focusing Cone\")\n  * [Interplanetary medium](/wiki/Interplanetary_medium \"Interplanetary medium\")\n  * [List of plasma (physics) articles](/wiki/List_of_plasma_\\(physics\\)_articles \"List of plasma \\(physics\\) articles\")\n  * [Magnetic sail](/wiki/Magnetic_sail \"Magnetic sail\")\n  * [Parker Solar Probe](/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe \"Parker Solar Probe\")\n  * [Parker spiral](/wiki/Parker_spiral \"Parker spiral\")\n  * [Plasmasphere](/wiki/Plasmasphere \"Plasmasphere\")\n  * [Solar Cycle](/wiki/Solar_Cycle \"Solar Cycle\")\n  * [Solar sail](/wiki/Solar_sail \"Solar sail\")\n  * [Solar Wind Composition Experiment](/wiki/Solar_Wind_Composition_Experiment \"Solar Wind Composition Experiment\")\n  * [STEREO](/wiki/STEREO \"STEREO\")\n  * [Sunspot](/wiki/Sunspot \"Sunspot\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_wind&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ McComas, D.
