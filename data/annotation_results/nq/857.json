This is due to Cardiff previously having a 5 digit code (01222)\nwith six-digit local numbers, and to the fact that all of its local numbers\nbegin with _20_ until 2005. This problem is also widespread in cities with\nother 02x codes such as [Coventry](/wiki/Coventry \"Coventry\"),\n[London](/wiki/London \"London\"), [Portsmouth](/wiki/Portsmouth \"Portsmouth\")\nand [Southampton](/wiki/Southampton \"Southampton\"), and in the region of\n[Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\").\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_UK_dialling_codes_covering_Wales&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of United Kingdom dialling codes](/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_dialling_codes \"List of United Kingdom dialling codes\")\n  * [UK telephone numbering plan](/wiki/UK_telephone_numbering_plan \"UK telephone numbering plan\")\n  * [Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom](/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom\")\n  * [Telecommunications in the United Kingdom](/wiki/Telecommunications_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Telecommunications in the United Kingdom\")\n  * [UK telephone code misconceptions](/wiki/UK_telephone_code_misconceptions \"UK telephone code misconceptions\")\n\n![](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1)\n\nRetrieved from\n\"[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_UK_dialling_codes_covering_Wales&oldid=696190870](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_UK_dialling_codes_covering_Wales&oldid=696190870)\"\n\n[Categories](/wiki/Help:Category \"Help:Category\"):\n\n  * [Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom](/wiki/Category:Telephone_numbers_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Category:Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom\")\n  * [Wales communications-related lists](/wiki/Category:Wales_communications-related_lists \"Category:Wales communications-related lists\")\n\n## Navigation menu\n\n### Personal tools\n\n  * Not logged in\n  * [Talk](/wiki/Special:MyTalk \"Discussion about edits from this IP address \\[ctrl-alt-n\\]\")\n  * [Contributions](/wiki/Special:MyContributions \"A list of edits made from this IP address \\[ctrl-alt-y\\]\")\n  * [Create account](/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=List+of+UK+dialling+codes+covering+Wales \"You are encouraged to create an account and log in;
