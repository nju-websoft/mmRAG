The confrontation is often considered [the\nclosest](/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls \"List of nuclear close calls\") the\n[Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\") came to escalating into a full-scale\n[nuclear war](/wiki/Nuclear_warfare \"Nuclear warfare\").[2]\n\nIn response to the failed [Bay of Pigs Invasion](/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion\n\"Bay of Pigs Invasion\") of 1961 and the presence of American [Jupiter\nballistic missiles](/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter \"PGM-19 Jupiter\") in Italy and\nTurkey, Soviet leader [Nikita Khrushchev](/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev \"Nikita\nKhrushchev\") decided to agree to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on\nthe island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during a\nsecret meeting between Khrushchev and [Fidel Castro](/wiki/Fidel_Castro \"Fidel\nCastro\") in July 1962 and construction of a number of [missile launch\nfacilities](/wiki/Missile_launch_facility \"Missile launch facility\") started\nlater that summer.\n\nThe [1962 United States elections](/wiki/United_States_elections,_1962 \"United\nStates elections, 1962\") were under way, and the White House had for months\ndenied charges that it was ignoring dangerous Soviet missiles 90 miles (140\nkm) from Florida. The missile preparations were confirmed when an Air Force\n[U-2 spy plane](/wiki/Lockheed_U-2 \"Lockheed U-2\") [produced clear\nphotographic evidence](/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance#Cold_War \"Aerial\nreconnaissance\") of [medium-range (SS-4)](/wiki/SS-4_Sandal \"SS-4 Sandal\") and\n[intermediate-range (R-14) ballistic missile](/wiki/R-14_Chusovaya \"R-14\nChusovaya\") facilities. The U.S. established a military blockade to prevent\nfurther missiles from reaching Cuba; Oval Office tapes during the crisis\nrevealed that Kennedy had also put the blockade in place as an attempt to\nprovoke Soviet-backed forces in Berlin as well. It announced that they would\nnot permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the\nweapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter a long period of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between\nU.S. President [John F. Kennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F. Kennedy\") and\nKhrushchev. Publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in\nCuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to [United\nNations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\") verification, in exchange for\na U.S. public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again.\nSecretly, the United States also agreed that it would dismantle all U.S.-built\n[Jupiter MRBMs](/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter \"PGM-19 Jupiter\"), which had been\ndeployed in Turkey against the Soviet Union; there has been debate on whether\nor not Italy was included in the agreement as well.\n\nWhen all offensive missiles and [Ilyushin Il-28](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-28\n\"Ilyushin Il-28\") light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was\nformally ended on November 21, 1962. The negotiations between the United\nStates and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and\ndirect communication line between Washington and Moscow. As a result, the\n[Moscow–Washington hotline](/wiki/Moscow%E2%80%93Washington_hotline\n\"Moscow–Washington hotline\") was established. A series of agreements reduced\nUS-Soviet tensions for several years.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Earlier US actions\n  * 2 Balance of power\n  * 3 Soviet deployment of missiles in Cuba\n  * 4 Missiles reported\n    * 4.1 Aerial images find Soviet missiles\n    * 4.2 President notified\n    * 4.3 Responses considered\n  * 5 Operational plans\n  * 6 Blockade\n    * 6.1 Speech to the nation\n    * 6.2 Crisis deepens\n    * 6.3 International response\n    * 6.4 Soviet broadcast\n    * 6.5 U.S. alert level raised\n    * 6.6 Blockade challenged\n    * 6.7 Stalemate\n  * 7 Secret negotiations\n    * 7.1 Crisis continues\n    * 7.2 Drafting response\n    * 7.3 Very close to launching thermonuclear war\n      * 7.3.1 Depth charges against a Soviet submarine armed with nuclear weapons\n      * 7.3.2 Unauthorized US spy flights\n  * 8 Crisis ends\n  * 9 Aftermath\n    * 9.1 Soviet leadership\n    * 9.2 Cuban leadership\n    * 9.3 US leadership\n    * 9.4 Human casualties\n  * 10 Later revelations\n  * 11 In popular culture\n    * 11.1 Media representations\n  * 12 See also\n  * 13 Notes\n  * 14 References\n  * 15 Further reading\n    * 15.1 Historiography\n    * 15.2 Primary sources\n    * 15.3 Lesson plans\n  * 16 External links\n\n## Earlier US\nactions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Earlier US actions\")]\n\nThe U.S. was concerned about an expansion of [communism](/wiki/Communism\n\"Communism\"), and a [Latin American](/wiki/Latin_American \"Latin American\")\ncountry openly allying with the Soviet Union was regarded by it as\nunacceptable since the end of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War\nII\"), and the start of the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\"). Such an\ninvolvement would also directly defy the [Monroe\nDoctrine](/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine \"Monroe Doctrine\"), a U.S. policy limiting\nU.S. involvement in European colonies and European affairs but holding that\nthe [Western Hemisphere](/wiki/Western_Hemisphere \"Western Hemisphere\") was in\nthe U.S. [sphere of influence](/wiki/Sphere_of_influence \"Sphere of\ninfluence\").\n\nThe Kennedy administration had been publicly embarrassed by the failed [Bay of\nPigs Invasion](/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion \"Bay of Pigs Invasion\") in May 1961,\nwhich had been launched under President [John F.\nKennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F. Kennedy\") by [CIA](/wiki/CIA\n\"CIA\")-trained forces of [Cuban exiles](/wiki/Cuban_exile \"Cuban exile\").\nAfterward, former President [Dwight Eisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_Eisenhower\n\"Dwight Eisenhower\") told Kennedy that \"the failure of the Bay of Pigs will\nembolden the Soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do.\"[3]:10\nThe half-hearted invasion left Soviet premier [Nikita\nKhrushchev](/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev \"Nikita Khrushchev\") and his advisers with\nthe impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet adviser wrote,\n\"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis\nsituations... too intelligent and too weak.\"[3] U.S. covert operations against\nCuba continued in 1961 with the unsuccessful [Operation\nMongoose](/wiki/Operation_Mongoose \"Operation Mongoose\").[4]\n\nIn addition, Khrushchev's impression of Kennedy's weaknesses was confirmed by\nthe President's response during the [Berlin Crisis of\n1961](/wiki/Berlin_Crisis_of_1961 \"Berlin Crisis of 1961\"), particularly to\nthe building of the [Berlin Wall](/wiki/Berlin_Wall \"Berlin Wall\"). Speaking\nto Soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, Khrushchev asserted, \"I\nknow for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally\nspeaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.\" He\nalso told his son [Sergei](/wiki/Sergei_Khrushchev \"Sergei Khrushchev\") that\non Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree.\"[5]\n\nIn January 1962, [US Army](/wiki/US_Army \"US Army\") General [Edward\nLansdale](/wiki/Edward_Lansdale \"Edward Lansdale\") described plans to\noverthrow the Cuban government in a top-secret report (partially declassified\n1989), addressed to Kennedy and officials involved with Operation Mongoose.[4]\nCIA agents or \"pathfinders\" from the [Special Activities\nDivision](/wiki/Special_Activities_Division \"Special Activities Division\")\nwere to be infiltrated into Cuba to carry out sabotage and organization,\nincluding radio broadcasts.[6] In February 1962, the US launched an [embargo\nagainst Cuba](/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba \"United States embargo\nagainst Cuba\"),[7] and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for\nimplementation of the overthrow of the Cuban government, mandating guerrilla\noperations to begin in August and September. \"Open revolt and overthrow of the\nCommunist regime\" would occur in the first two weeks of October.[4]\n\n## Balance of\npower[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Balance of power\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

In fact, the US led the Soviets by a wide margin that would only\nincrease. In 1961, the Soviets had only four [intercontinental ballistic\nmissiles](/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile \"Intercontinental ballistic\nmissile\") ([R-7 Semyorka](/wiki/R-7_Semyorka \"R-7 Semyorka\")). By October\n1962, they may have had a few dozen, with some intelligence estimates as high\nas 75.[8]\n\nThe U.S., on the other hand, had 170 ICBMs and was quickly building more. It\nalso had eight [_George Washington_](/wiki/George_Washington-class_submarine\n\"George Washington-class submarine\")\\- and [_Ethan Allen_\n-class](/wiki/Ethan_Allen-class_submarine \"Ethan Allen-class submarine\")\n[ballistic missile submarines](/wiki/Ballistic_missile_submarine \"Ballistic\nmissile submarine\"), with the capability to launch 16\n[Polaris](/wiki/UGM-27_Polaris \"UGM-27 Polaris\") missiles, each with a range\nof 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km).\n\nKhrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to\nthe world that the Soviets were building missiles \"like sausages\" but Soviet\nmissiles' numbers and capabilities actually were nowhere close to his\nassertions. The Soviet Union had [medium-range ballistic\nmissiles](/wiki/Medium-range_ballistic_missile \"Medium-range ballistic\nmissile\") in quantity, about 700 of them, but they were very unreliable and\ninaccurate. The US had a considerable advantage in total number of nuclear\nwarheads (27,000 against 3,600) and in the technology required for their\naccurate delivery.\n\nThe US also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power; but\nthe Soviets had a 2-1 advantage in conventional ground forces, more pronounced\nin field guns and tanks, particularly in the European theater.[8]\n\n## Soviet deployment of missiles in\nCuba[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Soviet deployment of missiles in Cuba\")]\n\nIn May 1961, Soviet Premier [Nikita Khrushchev](/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev\n\"Nikita Khrushchev\") was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing\nlead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet\nintermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the\nSoviet Ambassador in Havana, [Alexandr Ivanovich\nAlexeyev](/wiki/Alexandr_Ivanovich_Alexeyev \"Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev\"),\nwho argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.[9]\nKhrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a\n\"splendid [first strike](/wiki/First_strike \"First strike\")\" capability that\nput the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20\n[ICBMs](/wiki/ICBM \"ICBM\") capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US\nfrom inside the Soviet Union.[10] The poor accuracy and reliability of the\nmissiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more\nreliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.[10]\n\nTherefore, Soviet nuclear capability in 1962 placed less emphasis on ICBMs\nthan on medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles ([MRBMs](/wiki/MRBM\n\"MRBM\") and [IRBMs](/wiki/IRBM \"IRBM\")). The missiles could hit American\nallies and most of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska \"Alaska\") from Soviet territory but\nnot the [Contiguous US](/wiki/Contiguous_US \"Contiguous US\"). Graham Allison,\nthe director of [Harvard University](/wiki/Harvard_University \"Harvard\nUniversity\")'s [Belfer Center for Science and International\nAffairs](/wiki/Belfer_Center_for_Science_and_International_Affairs \"Belfer\nCenter for Science and International Affairs\"), points out, \"The Soviet Union\ncould not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new ICBMs on its own soil.\nIn order to meet the threat it faced in 1962, 1963, and 1964, it had very few\noptions. Moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could\nreach American targets was one.\"[11]\n\nA second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was because\nKhrushchev wanted to bring [West Berlin](/wiki/West_Berlin \"West Berlin\"),\ncontrolled by the American, British and French within Communist [East\nGermany](/wiki/East_Germany \"East Germany\"), into the Soviet orbit. The East\nGermans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of\n[Berlin](/wiki/Berlin \"Berlin\") a grave threat to East Germany. Khrushchev\nmade West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War. Khrushchev believed\nthat if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could\nmuscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western\ncountermeasures in Berlin. If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after\nit became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles\nfor West Berlin. Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the\ntrade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is,\nfrom Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite\nsome rewards to it.\"[12]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Jupiter_on_its_launch_pad.jpg/220px-\nJupiter_on_its_launch_pad.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jupiter_on_its_launch_pad.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jupiter_on_its_launch_pad.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMore than 100 US-built missiles having the capability to strike Moscow with\nnuclear warheads were [deployed in Italy and\nTurkey](/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter#Military_deployment \"PGM-19 Jupiter\") in 1961.\n\nKhrushchev was also reacting in part to the nuclear threat of obsolescent\n[Jupiter](/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter \"PGM-19 Jupiter\") intermediate-range ballistic\nmissiles that had been installed by the US in Turkey in April 1962.[8]\n\nIn early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists\naccompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with\nCuban leader [Fidel Castro](/wiki/Fidel_Castro \"Fidel Castro\"). The Cuban\nleadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and\nenthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba.\nHowever, according to another source, Castro objected to the missiles\ndeployment that would have made him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was\npersuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the\ninterests of the entire socialist camp.[13] Also, the deployment would include\nshort-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval\nvessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.\n\nBy May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles\nsecretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was\nimminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists,\nespecially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans \"with\nmore than words.... the logical answer was missiles.\"[14]:29 The Soviets\nmaintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were\napproved by [Rodion Malinovsky](/wiki/Rodion_Malinovsky \"Rodion Malinovsky\")\non July 4 and Khrushchev on July 7.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the Soviets' operation entailed elaborate [denial and\ndeception](/wiki/Denial_and_deception \"Denial and deception\"), known as\n\"[maskirovka](/wiki/Russian_military_deception \"Russian military\ndeception\")\".[15] All the planning and preparation for transporting and\ndeploying the missiles were carried out in the utmost secrecy, with only a\nvery few told the exact nature of the mission. Even the troops detailed for\nthe mission were given misdirection by being told that they were headed for a\ncold region and being outfitted with ski boots, fleece-lined parkas, and other\nwinter equipment.[15] The Soviet codename was [Operation\nAnadyr](/wiki/Operation_Anadyr \"Operation Anadyr\"). The [Anadyr\nRiver](/wiki/Anadyr_River \"Anadyr River\") flows into the [Bering\nSea](/wiki/Bering_Sea \"Bering Sea\"), and Anadyr is also the\n[capital](/wiki/Anadyr_\\(town\\) \"Anadyr \\(town\\)\") of [Chukotsky\nDistrict](/wiki/Chukotsky_District \"Chukotsky District\") and a bomber base in\nthe far eastern region. All the measures were meant to conceal the program\nfrom both internal and external audiences.[15]\n\nSpecialists in missile construction under the guise of \"machine operators,\"\n\"irrigation specialists,\" and \"agricultural specialists\" arrived in July.[15]\nA total of 43,000 foreign troops would ultimately be brought in.[16] Marshal\nSergei Biryuzov, chief of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that\nvisited Cuba. He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and\ncamouflaged by palm trees.[8]\n\nThe Cuban leadership was further upset when in September, the [US\nCongress](/wiki/US_Congress \"US Congress\") approved Joint Resolution 230,\nwhich expressed Congress's resolve to prevent the creation of an externally-\nsupported military establishment.[17][18] On the same day, the US announced a\nmajor military exercise in the Caribbean,\n[PHIBRIGLEX-62](/wiki/Operation_Ortsac \"Operation Ortsac\"), which Cuba\ndenounced as a deliberate provocation and proof that the US planned to invade\nCuba.[18][19][_[unreliable\nsource?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources \"Wikipedia:Identifying\nreliable sources\")_]\n\nThe Soviet leadership believed, based on its perception of Kennedy's lack of\nconfidence during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, that he would avoid confrontation\nand accept the missiles as a _fait accompli_.[3]:1 On September 11, the Soviet\nUnion publicly warned that a US attack on Cuba or on Soviet ships that were\ncarrying supplies to the island would mean war.[4] The Soviets continued the\n_Maskirovka_ program to conceal their actions in Cuba. They repeatedly denied\nthat the weapons being brought into Cuba were offensive in nature. On\nSeptember 7, [Soviet Ambassador to the United\nStates](/wiki/Soviet_Ambassador_to_the_United_States \"Soviet Ambassador to the\nUnited States\") [Anatoly Dobrynin](/wiki/Anatoly_Dobrynin \"Anatoly Dobrynin\")\nassured [United States Ambassador to the United\nNations](/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations \"United States\nAmbassador to the United Nations\") [Adlai Stevenson](/wiki/Adlai_Stevenson_II\n\"Adlai Stevenson II\") that the Soviet Union was supplying only defensive\nweapons to Cuba. On September 11, the [Telegrafnoe Agentstvo Sovetskogo\nSoyuza](/wiki/Telegraph_Agency_of_the_Soviet_Union \"Telegraph Agency of the\nSoviet Union\") (Soviet News Agency TASS) announced that the Soviet Union had\nno need or intention to introduce offensive nuclear missiles into Cuba. On\nOctober 13, Dobrynin was questioned by former Undersecretary of State [Chester\nBowles](/wiki/Chester_Bowles \"Chester Bowles\") about whether the Soviets\nplanned to put offensive weapons in Cuba. He denied any such plans.[18] On\nOctober 17, Soviet embassy official Georgy Bolshakov brought President Kennedy\na personal message from Khrushchev reassuring him that \"under no circumstances\nwould surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba.\"[18]:494\n\nAs early as August 1962, the US suspected the Soviets of building missile\nfacilities in Cuba. During that month, its intelligence services gathered\ninformation about sightings by ground observers of Russian-built\n[MiG-21](/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21 \"Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21\") fighters and\n[Il-28](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-28 \"Ilyushin Il-28\") light bombers.\n[U-2](/wiki/Lockheed_U-2 \"Lockheed U-2\") spyplanes found [S-75\nDvina](/wiki/S-75_Dvina \"S-75 Dvina\") (NATO designation _SA-2_) surface-to-air\nmissile sites at eight different locations. CIA director [John A.\nMcCone](/wiki/John_A._McCone \"John A. McCone\") was suspicious. Sending\nantiaircraft missiles into Cuba, he reasoned, \"made sense only if Moscow\nintended to use them to shield a base for ballistic missiles aimed at the\nUnited States.\"[20] On August 10, he wrote a memo to Kennedy in which he\nguessed that the Soviets were preparing to introduce ballistic missiles into\nCuba.[8]\n\nWith important Congressional elections scheduled for November, the crisis\nbecame enmeshed in American politics. On August 31, Senator [Kenneth\nKeating](/wiki/Kenneth_Keating \"Kenneth Keating\") (R-New York), who received\nhis information from Cuban exiles in Florida, warned on the Senate floor that\nthe Soviet Union may be constructing a missile base in Cuba. He charged the\nKennedy administration of covering up a major threat to the US.[21] Air Force\nGeneral [Curtis LeMay](/wiki/Curtis_LeMay \"Curtis LeMay\") presented a pre-\ninvasion bombing plan to Kennedy in September, and spy flights and minor\nmilitary harassment from US forces at [Guantanamo Bay Naval\nBase](/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base \"Guantanamo Bay Naval Base\") were the\nsubject of continual Cuban diplomatic complaints to the US government.[4]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/1962_Cuba_Missiles_%2830848755396%29.jpg/350px-1962_Cuba_Missiles_%2830848755396%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:1962_Cuba_Missiles_\\(30848755396\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1962_Cuba_Missiles_\\(30848755396\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMap created by American intelligence showing Surface-to-Air Missile activity\nin Cuba, September 5, 1962\n\nThe first consignment of [R-12](/wiki/R-12_\\(missile\\) \"R-12 \\(missile\\)\")\nmissiles arrived on the night of September 8, followed by a second on\nSeptember 16.

The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace\nreadily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of\nreports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of\ndubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as\ndescribing defensive missiles.\n\nOnly five reports bothered the analysts. They described large trucks passing\nthrough towns at night that were carrying very long canvas-covered cylindrical\nobjects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and\nmaneuvering. Defensive missiles could turn. The reports could not be\nsatisfactorily dismissed.[25]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/U2_Image_of_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg/220px-U2_Image_of_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg)](/wiki/File:U2_Image_of_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:U2_Image_of_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA U-2 reconnaissance photograph of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles,\ntheir transports and tents for fueling and maintenance.\n\n### Aerial images find Soviet\nmissiles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Aerial images find Soviet missiles\")]\n\nThe United States had been sending [U-2](/wiki/Lockheed_U-2 \"Lockheed U-2\")\nsurveillance over Cuba since the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.[26] The first\nissue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on August 30,\nwhen a U-2 operated by the U.S. Air Force's [Strategic Air\nCommand](/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command \"Strategic Air Command\") flew over\n[Sakhalin Island](/wiki/Sakhalin \"Sakhalin\") in the [Soviet Far\nEast](/wiki/Soviet_Far_East \"Soviet Far East\") by mistake. The Soviets lodged\na protest and the US apologized. Nine days later, a [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwan\n\"Taiwan\")-operated U-2[27][28] was lost over western China to an SA-2\n[surface-to-air missile](/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile \"Surface-to-air\nmissile\"). US officials were worried that one of the Cuban or Soviet SAMs in\nCuba might shoot down a CIA U-2, initiating another international incident. In\na meeting with members of the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance (COMOR) on\nSeptember 10, Secretary of State [Dean Rusk](/wiki/Dean_Rusk \"Dean Rusk\") and\nNational Security Advisor [McGeorge Bundy](/wiki/McGeorge_Bundy \"McGeorge\nBundy\") heavily restricted further U-2 flights over Cuban airspace. The\nresulting lack of coverage over the island for the next five weeks became\nknown to historians as the \"Photo Gap.\"[29] No significant U-2 coverage was\nachieved over the interior of the island. US officials attempted to use a\n[Corona photoreconnaissance satellite](/wiki/Corona_\\(satellite\\) \"Corona\n\\(satellite\\)\") to obtain coverage over reported Soviet military deployments,\nbut imagery acquired over western Cuba by a Corona KH-4 mission on October 1\nwas heavily covered by clouds and haze and failed to provide any usable\nintelligence.[30] At the end of September, Navy reconnaissance aircraft\nphotographed the Soviet ship _Kasimov_ , with large crates on its deck the\nsize and shape of [Il-28 light bomber](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-28 \"Ilyushin Il-28\")\nfuselages.[8]\n\nIn September 1962, analysts from the [Defense Intelligence\nAgency](/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency \"Defense Intelligence Agency\") (DIA)\nnoticed that Cuban surface-to-air missile sites were arranged in a pattern\nsimilar to those used by the Soviet Union to protect its [ICBM](/wiki/ICBM\n\"ICBM\") bases, leading DIA to lobby for the resumption of U-2 flights over the\nisland.[31] Although in the past the flights had been conducted by the CIA,\npressure from the Defense Department made the authority be transferred to the\nAir Force.[8] Following the loss of a CIA U-2 over the Soviet Union in May\n1960, it was thought that if another U-2 were shot down, an Air Force aircraft\narguably being used for a legitimate military purpose would be easier to\nexplain than a CIA flight.\n\nWhen the reconnaissance missions were reauthorized on October 9, poor weather\nkept the planes from flying. The US first obtained U-2 photographic evidence\nof the missiles on October 14, when a [U-2](/wiki/Lockheed_U-2 \"Lockheed U-2\")\nflight piloted by Major [Richard Heyser](/wiki/Richard_Heyser \"Richard\nHeyser\") took 928 pictures on a path selected by\n[DIA](/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency \"Defense Intelligence Agency\")\nanalysts, capturing images of what turned out to be an SS-4 construction site\nat [San Cristóbal](/wiki/San_Crist%C3%B3bal,_Cuba \"San Cristóbal, Cuba\"),\n[Pinar del Río Province](/wiki/Pinar_del_R%C3%ADo_Province \"Pinar del Río\nProvince\") (now in [Artemisa Province](/wiki/Artemisa_Province \"Artemisa\nProvince\")), in western Cuba.[32]\n\n### President\nnotified[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: President notified\")]\n\nOn October 15, the CIA's [National Photographic Interpretation\nCenter](/wiki/National_Photographic_Interpretation_Center \"National\nPhotographic Interpretation Center\") (NPIC) reviewed the U-2 photographs and\nidentified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles.\nThis identification was made, in part, on the strength of reporting provided\nby [Oleg Penkovsky](/wiki/Oleg_Penkovsky \"Oleg Penkovsky\"), a [double\nagent](/wiki/Double_agent \"Double agent\") in the [GRU](/wiki/GRU \"GRU\")\nworking for [CIA](/wiki/CIA \"CIA\") and [MI6](/wiki/MI6 \"MI6\"). Although he\nprovided no direct reports of the Soviet missile deployments to Cuba,\ntechnical and doctrinal details of Soviet missile regiments that had been\nprovided by Penkovsky in the months and years prior to the Crisis helped NPIC\nanalysts correctly identify the missiles on U-2 imagery.[33]\n\nThat evening, the CIA notified the [Department of\nState](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State \"United States Department of\nState\") and at 8:30 pm [EDT](/wiki/Eastern_Daylight_Time \"Eastern Daylight\nTime\"), Bundy chose to wait until the next morning to tell the President.\nMcNamara was briefed at midnight. The next morning, Bundy met with Kennedy and\nshowed him the U-2 photographs and briefed him on the CIA's analysis of the\nimages.[34] At 6:30 pm EDT, Kennedy convened a meeting of the nine members of\nthe National Security Council and five other key advisors,[35] in a group he\nformally named the [Executive Committee of the National Security\nCouncil](/wiki/EXCOMM \"EXCOMM\") (EXCOMM) after the fact on October 22 by the\nNational Security Action Memorandum 196.[36] Without informing the members of\nEXCOMM, President Kennedy tape recorded all of their proceedings, and Sheldon\nM.

The EXCOMM quickly\ndiscussed several possible courses of action:[39]\n\n  1. Do nothing: American vulnerability to Soviet missiles was not new.\n  2. Diplomacy: Use diplomatic pressure to get the Soviet Union to remove the missiles.\n  3. Secret approach: Offer Castro the choice of splitting with the Russians or being invaded.\n  4. Invasion: Full force invasion of Cuba and overthrow of Castro.\n  5. Air strike: Use the US Air Force to attack all known missile sites.\n  6. Blockade: Use the US Navy to block any missiles from arriving in Cuba.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Cuban_Missile_Crisis_Game_Tree.svg/220px-\nCuban_Missile_Crisis_Game_Tree.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Cuban_Missile_Crisis_Game_Tree.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cuban_Missile_Crisis_Game_Tree.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAs the article describes, both the US and the Soviet Union considered many\npossible outcomes of their actions and threats during the crisis (Allison,\nGraham T.; Zelikow, Philip D.). This [game tree](/wiki/Game_tree \"Game tree\")\nmodels how both actors would have considered their decisions. It is broken\ndown into a simple form for basic understanding.\n\nThe [Joint Chiefs of Staff](/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff \"Joint Chiefs of\nStaff\") unanimously agreed that a full-scale attack and invasion was the only\nsolution. They believed that the Soviets would not attempt to stop the US from\nconquering Cuba. Kennedy was skeptical:\n\n> They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something.\n> They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their\n> missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing. If they don't take\n> action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin.[40]\n\nKennedy concluded that attacking Cuba by air would signal the Soviets to\npresume \"a clear line\" to conquer Berlin. Kennedy also believed that US allies\nwould think of the country as \"trigger-happy cowboys\" who lost Berlin because\nthey could not peacefully resolve the Cuban situation.[41]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/McNamara_and_Kennedy.jpg/220px-\nMcNamara_and_Kennedy.jpg)](/wiki/File:McNamara_and_Kennedy.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:McNamara_and_Kennedy.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPresident Kennedy and Secretary of Defense McNamara in an EXCOMM meeting.\n\nThe EXCOMM then discussed the effect on the strategic balance of power, both\npolitical and military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the missiles\nwould seriously alter the military balance, but McNamara disagreed. An extra\n40, he reasoned, would make little difference to the overall strategic\nbalance. The US already had approximately 5,000 strategic warheads,[42]:261\nbut the Soviet Union had only 300. McNamara concluded that the Soviets having\n340 would not therefore substantially alter the strategic balance. In 1990, he\nreiterated that \"it made _no_ difference.... The military balance wasn't\nchanged. I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it now.\"[43]\n\nThe EXCOMM agreed that the missiles would affect the _political_ balance.\nKennedy had explicitly promised the American people less than a month before\nthe crisis that \"if Cuba should possess a capacity to carry out offensive\nactions against the United States... the United States would act.\"[44]:674–681\nAlso, credibility among US allies and people would be damaged if the Soviet\nUnion appeared to redress the strategic balance by placing missiles in Cuba.\nKennedy explained after the crisis that \"it would have politically changed the\nbalance of power. It would have appeared to, and appearances contribute to\nreality.\"[45]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/CMC_Gromyko.jpg/220px-\nCMC_Gromyko.jpg)](/wiki/File:CMC_Gromyko.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CMC_Gromyko.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPresident Kennedy meets with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in the\nOval Office (October 18, 1962)\n\nOn October 18, Kennedy met with Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, [Andrei\nGromyko](/wiki/Andrei_Gromyko \"Andrei Gromyko\"), who claimed the weapons were\nfor defensive purposes only. Not wanting to expose what he already knew and to\navoid panicking the American public,[46] Kennedy did not reveal that he was\nalready aware of the missile buildup.[47]\n\nBy October 19, frequent U-2 spy flights showed four operational sites.[48] On\nthe night of October 19 at 23:56 a helicopter from USS Essex CVS-9 squadron\nHSS-2 crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Lt. Cmdr. James Robert Hughes and AM-3\nGeorge Blythe perished. Their bodies were never recovered. On October 22, 1962\na second helicopter crashed into the Gulf, that also was from HSS-2 stationed\non the Essex. Lost that night were Lt. Cmdr. Witkowski and Enlisted Serviceman\n50 AZ Murphy. The details of the deaths of October 19, 1962 have never been\nprovided to the families affected. There are numerous rumors that exist from\nbad storms, Soviet interference with the flight, or a one-way suicide recon\nmission.

OPLAN 316 envisioned a full\ninvasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy following Air\nForce and naval airstrikes. However, Army units in the US would have had\ntrouble fielding mechanized and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not\nsupply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armored\ncontingent from the Army.\n\nOPLAN 312, primarily an Air Force and Navy carrier operation, was designed\nwith enough flexibility to do anything from engaging individual missile sites\nto providing air support for OPLAN 316's ground forces.[49]\n\n##\nBlockade[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Blockade\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/P-2H_Neptune_over_Soviet_ship_Oct_1962.jpg/220px-P-2H_Neptune_over_Soviet_ship_Oct_1962.jpg)](/wiki/File:P-2H_Neptune_over_Soviet_ship_Oct_1962.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:P-2H_Neptune_over_Soviet_ship_Oct_1962.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA US Navy [P-2H Neptune](/wiki/P-2_Neptune \"P-2 Neptune\") of VP-18 flying over\na Soviet cargo ship with crated [Il-28s](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-28 \"Ilyushin\nIl-28\") on deck during the Cuban Crisis.[50]\n\nKennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout October\n21, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the\nCuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba.[47] A full-scale invasion was\nnot the administration's first option. McNamara supported the naval\n[blockade](/wiki/Blockade \"Blockade\") as a strong but limited military action\nthat left the US in control. However, the term \"blockade\" was problematic.\nAccording to [international law](/wiki/International_law \"International law\"),\na blockade is an [act of war](/wiki/Casus_belli \"Casus belli\"), but the\nKennedy administration did not think that the Soviets would be provoked to\nattack by a mere blockade.[51] Additionally, legal experts at the [State\nDepartment](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State \"United States Department\nof State\") and [Justice Department](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice\n\"United States Department of Justice\") concluded that a declaration of war\ncould be avoided if another legal justification, based on the [Rio\nTreaty](/wiki/Inter-American_Treaty_of_Reciprocal_Assistance \"Inter-American\nTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance\") for defense of the Western Hemisphere, was\nobtained from a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members or the\n[Organization of American States](/wiki/Organization_of_American_States\n\"Organization of American States\") (OAS).[52]\n\n[Admiral](/wiki/Admiral \"Admiral\") [Anderson](/wiki/George_Whelan_Anderson_Jr.\n\"George Whelan Anderson Jr.\"), [Chief of Naval\nOperations](/wiki/Chief_of_Naval_Operations \"Chief of Naval Operations\") wrote\na position paper that helped Kennedy to differentiate between what they termed\na \"quarantine\"[53] of offensive weapons and a blockade of all materials,\nclaiming that a classic blockade was not the original intention. Since it\nwould take place in international waters, Kennedy obtained the approval of the\nOAS for military action under the hemispheric defense provisions of the Rio\nTreaty:\n\n> Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine\n> destroyers which were to report to the U.S. Commander South Atlantic\n> [COMSOLANT] at Trinidad on November 9.

Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all\n> types of goods and air transport. The action was to be backed up by\n> surveillance of Cuba. The CNO's scenario was followed closely in later\n> implementing the \"quarantine.\"\n\nOn October 19, the EXCOMM formed separate working groups to examine the air\nstrike and blockade options, and by the afternoon most support in the EXCOMM\nshifted to the blockade option. However, reservations about the plan continued\nto be voiced as late as the October 21, the paramount concern being that once\nthe blockade was put into effect, the Soviets would rush to complete some of\nthe missiles. Consequently, the US could find itself bombing operational\nmissiles if blockade failed to force Khrushchev to remove the missiles already\non the island.[55]\n\n### Speech to the\nnation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Speech to the nation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/President_Kennedy_signs_Cuba_quarantine_proclamation%2C_23_October_1962.jpg/220px-\nPresident_Kennedy_signs_Cuba_quarantine_proclamation%2C_23_October_1962.jpg)](/wiki/File:President_Kennedy_signs_Cuba_quarantine_proclamation,_23_October_1962.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:President_Kennedy_signs_Cuba_quarantine_proclamation,_23_October_1962.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nPresident Kennedy signs the Proclamation for Interdiction of the Delivery of\nOffensive Weapons to Cuba at the [Oval Office](/wiki/Oval_Office \"Oval\nOffice\") on October 23, 1962.[56]\n\nAt 3:00 pm EDT on October 22, President Kennedy formally established the\nExecutive Committee (EXCOMM) with National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM)\n196.

He\nnoted:\n\n> It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched\n> from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the\n> Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response\n> upon the Soviet Union.[60]\n\nKennedy described the administration's plan:\n\n> To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive\n> military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of\n> any kind bound for Cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to\n> contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back.

Castro reaffirmed\nCuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive\nand Cuba would not allow an inspection.[4]\n\n### International\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: International response\")]\n\nThree days after Kennedy's speech, the Chinese _[People's\nDaily](/wiki/People%27s_Daily \"People's Daily\")_ announced that \"650,000,000\nChinese men and women were standing by the Cuban people.\"[57] In West Germany,\nnewspapers supported the US's response by contrasting it with the weak\nAmerican actions in the region during the preceding months. They also\nexpressed some fear that the Soviets might retaliate in Berlin. In France on\nOctober 23, the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers. The\nnext day, an editorial in _[Le Monde](/wiki/Le_Monde \"Le Monde\")_ expressed\ndoubt about the authenticity of the CIA's photographic evidence. Two days\nlater, after a visit by a high-ranking CIA agent, the newspaper accepted the\nvalidity of the photographs. Also in France, in the October 29 issue of _[Le\nFigaro](/wiki/Le_Figaro \"Le Figaro\")_ , [Raymond Aron](/wiki/Raymond_Aron\n\"Raymond Aron\") wrote in support of the American response.[64] On October 24,\n[Pope John XXIII](/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII \"Pope John XXIII\") sent a message to\nthe Soviet embassy in Rome to be transmitted to the [Kremlin](/wiki/Kremlin\n\"Kremlin\") in which he voiced his concern for peace.

Khrushchev stated,\n\"if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to\npassion, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot afford not to\ndecline the despotic demands of the USA\" and that the Soviet Union views the\nblockade as \"an act of aggression\" and their ships will be instructed to\nignore it.[62]\n\n### U.S. alert level\nraised[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: U.S. alert level raised\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Adlai_Stevenson_shows_missiles_to_UN_Security_Council_with_David_Parker_standing.jpg/220px-\nAdlai_Stevenson_shows_missiles_to_UN_Security_Council_with_David_Parker_standing.jpg)](/wiki/File:Adlai_Stevenson_shows_missiles_to_UN_Security_Council_with_David_Parker_standing.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Adlai_Stevenson_shows_missiles_to_UN_Security_Council_with_David_Parker_standing.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Adlai Stevenson](/wiki/Adlai_Stevenson_II \"Adlai Stevenson II\") shows aerial\nphotos of Cuban missiles to the United Nations, October 25, 1962.\n\nThe US requested an emergency meeting of the [United Nations Security\nCouncil](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council \"United Nations Security\nCouncil\") on October 25. US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson\nconfronted Soviet Ambassador [Valerian Zorin](/wiki/Valerian_Zorin \"Valerian\nZorin\") in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, challenging him to\nadmit the existence of the missiles. Ambassador Zorin refused to answer. The\nnext day at 10:00 pm EDT, the US raised the readiness level of SAC forces to\nDEFCON 2. For the only confirmed time in US history,\n[B-52](/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress \"Boeing B-52 Stratofortress\") bombers\nwent on continuous airborne alert, and [B-47](/wiki/Boeing_B-47_Stratojet\n\"Boeing B-47 Stratojet\") medium bombers were dispersed to various military and\ncivilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15 minutes'\nnotice.[67][68] One eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, and\nsome 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of\nwhich targeted Cuba,[69] and [Air Defense Command](/wiki/Air_Defense_Command\n\"Air Defense Command\") (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16\ndispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining 15-minute alert\nstatus.[49] Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52s were sent to orbit points within\nstriking distance of the Soviet Union so that it would believe that the US was\nserious.[70] [Jack J. Catton](/wiki/Jack_J._Catton \"Jack J. Catton\") later\nestimated that about 80 percent of SAC's planes were ready for launch during\nthe crisis; [David A. Burchinal](/wiki/David_A._Burchinal \"David A.\nBurchinal\") recalled that, by contrast:[71]\n\n> the Russians were so thoroughly stood down, and we knew it. They didn't make\n> any move. They did not increase their alert; they did not increase any\n> flights, or their air defense posture. They didn't do a thing, they froze in\n> place.

However, TAC and the\n[Military Air Transport Service](/wiki/Military_Air_Transport_Service\n\"Military Air Transport Service\") had problems. The concentration of aircraft\nin Florida strained command and support echelons, which faced critical\nundermanning in security, armaments, and communications; the absence of\ninitial authorization for war-reserve stocks of conventional munitions forced\nTAC to scrounge; and the lack of airlift assets to support a major airborne\ndrop necessitated the call-up of 24 Reserve squadrons.[49]\n\nOn October 25 at 1:45 am EDT, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by\nstating that the US was forced into action after receiving repeated assurances\nthat no offensive missiles were being placed in Cuba, and when the assurances\nproved to be false, the deployment \"required the responses I have\nannounced.... I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit\na restoration of the earlier situation.\"\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Location_of_Navy_and_Soviet_ships_during_the_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg/220px-\nLocation_of_Navy_and_Soviet_ships_during_the_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg)](/wiki/File:Location_of_Navy_and_Soviet_ships_during_the_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Location_of_Navy_and_Soviet_ships_during_the_Cuban_Missile_Crisis.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nA declassified map used by the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet showing the position\nof American and Soviet ships at the height of the crisis.\n\n### Blockade\nchallenged[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Blockade challenged\")]\n\nAt 7:15 am EDT on October 25, [USS  _Essex_](/wiki/USS_Essex_\\(CV-9\\) \"USS\nEssex \\(CV-9\\)\") and [USS  _Gearing_](/wiki/USS_Gearing_\\(DD-710\\) \"USS\nGearing \\(DD-710\\)\") attempted to intercept _Bucharest_ but failed to do so.\nFairly certain that the [tanker](/wiki/Tanker_\\(ship\\) \"Tanker \\(ship\\)\") did\nnot contain any military material, the US allowed it through the blockade.\nLater that day, at 5:43 pm, the commander of the blockade effort ordered the\ndestroyer [USS  _Joseph P.

That\ntook place the next day, and _Marucla_ was cleared through the blockade after\nits cargo was checked.[72]\n\nAt 5:00 pm EDT on October 25, William Clements announced that the missiles in\nCuba were still actively being worked on. That report was later verified by a\nCIA report that suggested there had been no slowdown at all. In response,\nKennedy issued Security Action Memorandum 199, authorizing the loading of\nnuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of [SACEUR](/wiki/SACEUR\n\"SACEUR\"), which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the Soviet\nUnion. During the day, the Soviets responded to the blockade by turning back\n14 ships that were presumably carrying offensive weapons.[68]\n\n###\nStalemate[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Stalemate\")]\n\nThe next morning, October 26, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed\nonly an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba. However, he was\npersuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and\ndiplomatic pressure. He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the\nisland to be increased from two per day to once every two hours. He also\nordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an\ninvasion went ahead.\n\nAt this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. The Soviets had shown\nno indication that they would back down and had made several comments to the\ncontrary. The US had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early\nstages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the Soviet\nUnion if it responded militarily, which was assumed.[73]\n\n## Secret\nnegotiations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Secret negotiations\")]\n\nAt 1:00 pm EDT on October 26, [John A. Scali](/wiki/John_A._Scali \"John A.\nScali\") of [ABC News](/wiki/ABC_News \"ABC News\") had lunch with Aleksandr\nFomin, the cover name of [Alexander Feklisov](/wiki/Alexander_Feklisov\n\"Alexander Feklisov\"), the [KGB](/wiki/KGB \"KGB\") [station\nchief](/wiki/Resident_spy \"Resident spy\") in Washington, at Fomin's request.\nFollowing the instructions of the [Politburo of the\nCPSU](/wiki/Politburo_of_the_CPSU \"Politburo of the CPSU\"),[74] Fomin noted,\n\"War seems about to break out.\" He asked Scali to use his contacts to talk to\nhis \"high-level friends\" at the State Department to see if the US would be\ninterested in a diplomatic solution. He suggested that the language of the\ndeal would contain an assurance from the Soviet Union to remove the weapons\nunder UN supervision and that Castro would publicly announce that he would not\naccept such weapons again in exchange for a public statement by the US that it\nwould avoid invading Cuba.[75] The US responded by asking the\n[Brazilian](/wiki/Brazil \"Brazil\") government to pass a message to Castro that\nthe US would be \"unlikely to invade\" if the missiles were removed.[63]\n\nMr. President, we and you ought not now to pull on the ends of the rope in\nwhich you have tied the knot of war, because the more the two of us pull, the\ntighter that knot will be tied. And a moment may come when that knot will be\ntied so tight that even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it,\nand then it will be necessary to cut that knot, and what that would mean is\nnot for me to explain to you, because you yourself understand perfectly of\nwhat terrible forces our countries dispose. Consequently, if there is no\nintention to tighten that knot and thereby to doom the world to the\ncatastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax the forces\npulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that knot. We\nare ready for this.\n\nLetter From Chairman Khrushchev to President Kennedy, October 26, 1962[76]\n\nOn October 26 at 6:00 pm EDT, the State Department started receiving a message\nthat appeared to be written personally by Khrushchev. It was Saturday at 2:00\nam in Moscow. The long letter took several minutes to arrive, and it took\ntranslators additional time to translate and transcribe it.[63]\n\n[Robert F. Kennedy](/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy \"Robert F. Kennedy\") described the\nletter as \"very long and emotional.\" Khrushchev reiterated the basic outline\nthat had been stated to Scali earlier in the day: \"I propose: we, for our\npart, will declare that our ships bound for Cuba are not carrying any\narmaments. You will declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with\nits troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade\nCuba. Then the necessity of the presence of our military specialists in Cuba\nwill disappear.\" At 6:45 pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally\nheard and was interpreted as a \"set up\" for the arrival of Khrushchev's\nletter. The letter was then considered official and accurate although it was\nlater learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord\nwithout official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and\ncontinued into the night.[63]\n\n### Crisis\ncontinues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Crisis continues\")]\n\n> Direct aggression against Cuba would mean nuclear war.

An installation similar to this one shot down Major\nAnderson's U-2 over Cuba.\n\nCastro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion of Cuba was soon at\nhand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared to\ncall for a [pre-emptive nuclear strike](/wiki/Pre-emptive_nuclear_strike \"Pre-\nemptive nuclear strike\") on the US in case of attack. However, in a 2010\ninterview, Castro expressed regret about his earlier stance on [first\nuse](/wiki/No_first_use \"No first use\"): \"After I've seen what I've seen, and\n[knowing what I know now](/wiki/Nuclear_winter#Policy_implications \"Nuclear\nwinter\"), it wasn't worth it at all.\"[78] Castro also ordered all anti-\naircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft:[79] the orders had been\nto fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00 am EDT on October 27, the CIA\ndelivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San\nCristobal and the two sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully\noperational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organize for\naction but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAt 9:00 am EDT on October 27, [Radio Moscow](/wiki/Radio_Moscow \"Radio\nMoscow\") began broadcasting a message from Khrushchev. Contrary to the letter\nof the night before, the message offered a new trade: the missiles on Cuba\nwould be removed in exchange for the removal of the\n[Jupiter](/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter \"PGM-19 Jupiter\") missiles from Italy and\nTurkey. At 10:00 am EDT, the executive committee met again to discuss the\nsituation and came to the conclusion that the change in the message was\nbecause of internal debate between Khrushchev and other party officials in the\nKremlin.[80]:300 Kennedy realized that he would be in an \"insupportable\nposition if this becomes Khrushchev's proposal\" because the missiles in Turkey\nwere not militarily useful and were being removed anyway and \"It's gonna – to\nany man at the United Nations or any other rational man, it will look like a\nvery fair trade.\" Bundy explained why Khrushchev's public acquiescence could\nnot be considered: \"The current threat to peace is not in Turkey, it is in\nCuba.\"[81]\n\nMcNamara noted that another tanker, the _Grozny_ , was about 600 miles (970\nkm) out and should be intercepted. He also noted that they had not made the\nSoviets aware of the blockade line and suggested relaying that information to\nthem via [U Thant](/wiki/U_Thant \"U Thant\") at the [United\nNations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\").[82]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/U-2F_refueling_from_KC-135Q.jpg/220px-U-2F_refueling_from_KC-135Q.jpg)](/wiki/File:U-2F_refueling_from_KC-135Q.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:U-2F_refueling_from_KC-135Q.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [Lockheed](/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation \"Lockheed Corporation\") U-2F, the high\naltitude reconnaissance type shot down over Cuba, being refueled by a\n[Boeing](/wiki/Boeing \"Boeing\") [KC-135](/wiki/KC-135 \"KC-135\")Q. The aircraft\nin 1962 was painted overall gray and carried USAF military markings and\nnational insignia.\n\nWhile the meeting progressed, at 11:03 am EDT a new message began to arrive\nfrom Khrushchev. The message stated, in part:\n\n\"You are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is\nninety-nine miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America.\nBut... you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive,\nin Italy and Turkey, literally next to us.... I therefore make this proposal:\nWe are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive....\nYour representatives will make a declaration to the effect that the United\nStates... will remove its analogous means from Turkey... and after that,\npersons entrusted by the United Nations Security Council could inspect on the\nspot the fulfillment of the pledges made.\"\n\nThe executive committee continued to meet through the day.\n\nThroughout the crisis, Turkey had repeatedly stated that it would be upset if\nthe [Jupiter](/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter \"PGM-19 Jupiter\") missiles were removed.\nItaly's Prime Minister [Amintore Fanfani](/wiki/Amintore_Fanfani \"Amintore\nFanfani\"), who was also Foreign Minister _ad interim_ , offered to allow\nwithdrawal of the missiles deployed in [Apulia](/wiki/Apulia \"Apulia\") as a\nbargaining chip. He gave the message to one of his most trusted friends,\n[Ettore Bernabei](/wiki/Ettore_Bernabei \"Ettore Bernabei\"), the general\nmanager of [RAI-TV](/wiki/RAI \"RAI\"), to convey to [Arthur M.

Unknown to the Soviets, the US regarded the Jupiter missiles as\nobsolescent and already supplanted by the Polaris nuclear ballistic submarine\nmissiles.[8]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Engine_u2.jpg/220px-\nEngine_u2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Engine_u2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Engine_u2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe engine of the [Lockheed U-2](/wiki/Lockheed_U-2 \"Lockheed U-2\") shot down\nover Cuba on display at [Museum of the\nRevolution](/wiki/Museum_of_the_Revolution_\\(Cuba\\) \"Museum of the Revolution\n\\(Cuba\\)\") in [Havana](/wiki/Havana \"Havana\").\n\nOn the morning of October 27, a U-2F (the third CIA U-2A, modified for air-to-\nair refueling) piloted by USAF Major [Rudolf Anderson](/wiki/Rudolf_Anderson\n\"Rudolf Anderson\"),[83] departed its forward operating location at [McCoy\nAFB](/wiki/McCoy_AFB \"McCoy AFB\"), Florida. At approximately 12:00 pm EDT, the\naircraft was struck by a [S-75 Dvina](/wiki/S-75_Dvina \"S-75 Dvina\")\n([NATO](/wiki/NATO \"NATO\") designation _[SA-2 Guideline](/wiki/SA-2_Guideline\n\"SA-2 Guideline\")_) [surface-to-air missile](/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile\n\"Surface-to-air missile\") launched from Cuba. The aircraft was shot down, and\nAnderson was killed. The stress in negotiations between the Soviets and the US\nintensified; it was only later believed that the decision to fire the missile\nwas made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander, acting on his own\nauthority. Later that day, at about 3:41 pm EDT, several US Navy [RF-8A\nCrusader](/wiki/F8U_Crusader \"F8U Crusader\") aircraft, on low-level\n[photoreconnaissance](/wiki/Photoreconnaissance \"Photoreconnaissance\")\nmissions, were fired upon.\n\nOn October 28, 1962, Khrushchev told his son Sergei that the shooting down of\nAnderson's U-2 was by the \"Cuban military at the direction of [Raul\nCastro](/wiki/Raul_Castro \"Raul Castro\").\"[84][85][86][87]\n\nAt 4:00 pm EDT, Kennedy recalled members of EXCOMM to the [White\nHouse](/wiki/White_House \"White House\") and ordered that a message should\nimmediately be sent to U Thant asking the Soviets to suspend work on the\nmissiles while negotiations were carried out. During the meeting, General\n[Maxwell Taylor](/wiki/Maxwell_Taylor \"Maxwell Taylor\") delivered the news\nthat the U-2 had been shot down. Kennedy had earlier claimed he would order an\nattack on such sites if fired upon, but he decided to not act unless another\nattack was made. Forty years later, McNamara said:\n\n> We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the\n> Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 was\n> shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the\n> Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a\n> Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision\n> by the Soviets to escalate the conflict.

Unknown to most members of the EXCOMM, Robert Kennedy had been\nmeeting with the Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in Washington to discover whether\nthe intentions were genuine. The EXCOMM was generally against the proposal\nbecause it would undermine NATO's authority, and the Turkish government had\nrepeatedly stated it was against any such trade.\n\nAs the meeting progressed, a new plan emerged, and Kennedy was slowly\npersuaded. The new plan called for him to ignore the latest message and\ninstead to return to Khrushchev's earlier one. Kennedy was initially hesitant,\nfeeling that Khrushchev would no longer accept the deal because a new one had\nbeen offered, but [Llewellyn Thompson](/wiki/Llewellyn_Thompson \"Llewellyn\nThompson\") argued that it was still possible.[91] White House Special Counsel\nand Adviser [Ted Sorensen](/wiki/Ted_Sorensen \"Ted Sorensen\") and Robert\nKennedy left the meeting and returned 45 minutes later, with a draft letter to\nthat effect. The President made several changes, had it typed, and sent it.\n\nAfter the EXCOMM meeting, a smaller meeting continued in the [Oval\nOffice](/wiki/Oval_Office \"Oval Office\"). The group argued that the letter\nshould be underscored with an oral message to Dobrynin that stated that if the\nmissiles were not withdrawn, military action would be used to remove them.\nRusk added one proviso that no part of the language of the deal would mention\nTurkey, but there would be an understanding that the missiles would be removed\n\"voluntarily\" in the immediate aftermath. The President agreed, and the\nmessage was sent.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/EXCOMM_meeting%2C_Cuban_Missile_Crisis%2C_29_October_1962.jpg/220px-\nEXCOMM_meeting%2C_Cuban_Missile_Crisis%2C_29_October_1962.jpg)](/wiki/File:EXCOMM_meeting,_Cuban_Missile_Crisis,_29_October_1962.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:EXCOMM_meeting,_Cuban_Missile_Crisis,_29_October_1962.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nOctober 29, 1962 [EXCOMM](/wiki/EXCOMM \"EXCOMM\") meeting held in the White\nHouse Cabinet Room. President Kennedy, [Robert McNamara](/wiki/Robert_McNamara\n\"Robert McNamara\") and [Dean Rusk](/wiki/Dean_Rusk \"Dean Rusk\").\n\nAt Rusk's request, Fomin and Scali met again. Scali asked why the two letters\nfrom Khrushchev were so different, and Fomin claimed it was because of \"poor\ncommunications.\" Scali replied that the claim was not credible and shouted\nthat he thought it was a \"stinking double cross.\" He went on to claim that an\ninvasion was only hours away, and Fomin stated that a response to the US\nmessage was expected from Khrushchev shortly and urged Scali to tell the State\nDepartment that no treachery was intended. Scali said that he did not think\nanyone would believe him, but he agreed to deliver the message. The two went\ntheir separate ways, and Scali immediately typed out a memo for the\nEXCOMM.[92]\n\nWithin the US establishment, it was well understood that ignoring the second\noffer and returning to the first put Khrushchev in a terrible position.\nMilitary preparations continued, and all active duty Air Force personnel were\nrecalled to their bases for possible action. Robert Kennedy later recalled the\nmood: \"We had not abandoned all hope, but what hope there was now rested with\nKhrushchev's revising his course within the next few hours. It was a hope, not\nan expectation. The expectation was military confrontation by Tuesday (October\n30), and possibly tomorrow (October 29) ....\"[92]\n\nAt 8:05 pm EDT, the letter drafted earlier in the day was delivered. The\nmessage read, \"As I read your letter, the key elements of your proposals—which\nseem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as follows: 1) You would\nagree to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under appropriate United\nNations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe-guards,\nto halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into Cuba. 2) We, on\nour part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through\nthe United Nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these\ncommitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and\n(b) to give assurances against the invasion of Cuba.\" The letter was also\nreleased directly to the press to ensure it could not be \"delayed.\"[93] With\nthe letter delivered, a deal was on the table. However, as Robert Kennedy\nnoted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00 pm EDT, the\nEXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn\nup for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets,\nnotably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to \"have two things\nready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly,\nplans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell\nthey're going to do something there.\"[94]\n\nAt 12:12 am EDT, on October 27, the US informed its NATO allies that \"the\nsituation is growing shorter.... the United States may find it necessary\nwithin a very short time in its interest and that of its fellow nations in the\nWestern Hemisphere to take whatever military action may be necessary.\" To add\nto the concern, at 6:00 am, the CIA reported that all missiles in Cuba were\nready for action.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Soviet_b-59_submarine.jpg/220px-\nSoviet_b-59_submarine.jpg)](/wiki/File:Soviet_b-59_submarine.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Soviet_b-59_submarine.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA U.S. Navy [HSS-1 Seabat](/wiki/HSS-1_Seabat \"HSS-1 Seabat\") helicopter\nhovers over Soviet submarine _B-59_ , forced to the surface by U.S. Naval\nforces in the Caribbean near Cuba (October 28–29, 1962)\n\nOn October 27, Khrushchev also received a letter from Castro, what is now\nknown as the Armageddon Letter (dated the day before), which was interpreted\nas urging the use of nuclear force in the event of an attack on Cuba:[95] \"I\nbelieve the imperialists' aggressiveness is extremely dangerous and if they\nactually carry out the brutal act of invading Cuba in violation of\ninternational law and morality, that would be the moment to eliminate such\ndanger forever through an act of clear legitimate defense, however harsh and\nterrible the solution would be,\" Castro wrote.[96]\n\n### Very close to launching thermonuclear\nwar[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Very close to launching thermonuclear war\")]\n\n#### Depth charges against a Soviet submarine armed with nuclear\nweapons[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Depth charges against a Soviet submarine armed with nuclear\nweapons\")]\n\nLater that same day, what the White House later called \"Black Saturday,\" the\nUS Navy dropped a series of \"signaling [depth charges](/wiki/Depth_charge\n\"Depth charge\")\" (practice depth charges the size of hand grenades[97]) on a\nSoviet submarine ([_B-59_](/wiki/Soviet_submarine_B-59 \"Soviet submarine\nB-59\")) at the blockade line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear-tipped\ntorpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was \"hulled\"\n(a hole in the hull from depth charges or surface fire).[98] The decision to\nlaunch these required agreement from all three officers on board, but one of\nthem, [Vasili Arkhipov](/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov \"Vasili Arkhipov\"), objected and\nso the launch was narrowly averted.\n\n#### Unauthorized US spy\nflights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Unauthorized US spy flights\")]\n\nOn the same day a U-2 spy plane made an accidental, unauthorized ninety-minute\noverflight of the Soviet Union's far eastern coast.[99] The Soviets responded\nby scrambling MiG fighters from [Wrangel Island](/wiki/Wrangel_Island \"Wrangel\nIsland\"); in turn, the Americans launched [F-102](/wiki/F-102_Delta_Dagger\n\"F-102 Delta Dagger\") fighters armed with nuclear air-to-air missiles over the\n[Bering Sea](/wiki/Bering_Sea \"Bering Sea\").[100]\n\n## Crisis\nends[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Crisis ends\")]\n\nOn Saturday, October 27, after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and\nKennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in\nTurkey and possibly southern Italy, the former on the border of the Soviet\nUnion, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba.[101] There is\nsome dispute as to whether removing the missiles from Italy was part of the\nsecret agreement. Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that it was, and when the\ncrisis had ended McNamara gave the order to dismantle the missiles in both\nItaly and Turkey.[102]\n\nAt this point, Khrushchev knew things the US did not: First, that the shooting\ndown of the U-2 by a Soviet missile violated direct orders from Moscow, and\nCuban antiaircraft fire against other US reconnaissance aircraft also violated\ndirect orders from Khrushchev to Castro.[103] Second, the Soviets already had\n162 nuclear warheads on Cuba that the US did not then believe were there.[104]\nThird, the Soviets and Cubans on the island would almost certainly have\nresponded to an invasion by using those nuclear weapons, even though Castro\nbelieved that every human in Cuba would likely die as a result.[105]\nKhrushchev also knew but may not have considered the fact that he had\nsubmarines armed with nuclear weapons that the US Navy may not have known\nabout. (See the section above on \"[Depth charges against a Soviet submarine\narmed with nuclear\nweapons](/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis#Depth_charges_against_a_Soviet_submarine_armed_with_nuclear_weapons\n\"Cuban Missile Crisis\")\".)\n\nKhrushchev knew he was losing control. President Kennedy had been told in\nearly 1961 that a nuclear war would likely kill a third of humanity, with most\nor all of those deaths concentrated in the US, the USSR, Europe and\nChina;[106] Khrushchev may well have received similar reports from his\nmilitary.\n\nWith this background, when Khrushchev heard Kennedy's threats relayed by\nRobert Kennedy to Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, he immediately drafted his\nacceptance of Kennedy's latest terms from his dacha without involving the\nPolitburo, as he had previously, and had them immediately broadcasts over\nRadio Moscow, which he believed the US would hear. In that broadcast at 9:00\nam EST, on October 28, Khrushchev stated that \"the Soviet government, in\naddition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at\nthe building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling\nof the weapons which you describe as 'offensive' and their crating and return\nto the Soviet Union.\"[107][108]\n\nAt 10:00 am, October 28, Kennedy first learned of Khrushchev's solution to the\ncrisis with the US removing the 15 [Jupiters](/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter \"PGM-19\nJupiter\") in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba.\nKhrushchev had made the offer in a public statement for the world to hear.\nDespite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly\nembraced the Soviet offer. \"This is a pretty good play of his,\" Kennedy said,\naccording to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room\nmeeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March of the year, causing a\nstream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. \"Most people will think this is a\nrather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it,\" Kennedy said. Vice\nPresident [Lyndon Johnson](/wiki/Lyndon_Johnson \"Lyndon Johnson\") was the\nfirst to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer.\nFinally, Kennedy ended the debate. \"We can't very well invade Cuba with all\nits toil and blood,\" Kennedy said, \"when we could have gotten them out by\nmaking a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record,\nthen you don't have a very good war.\"[109]\n\nKennedy immediately responded, issuing a statement calling the letter \"an\nimportant and constructive contribution to peace.\" He continued this with a\nformal letter:\n\n> I consider my letter to you of October twenty-seventh and your reply of\n> today as firm undertakings on the part of both our governments which should\n> be promptly carried out.... The US will make a statement in the framework of\n> the Security Council in reference to Cuba as follows: it will declare that\n> the United States of America will respect the inviolability of Cuban\n> borders, its sovereignty, that it take the pledge not to interfere in\n> internal affairs, not to intrude themselves and not to permit our territory\n> to be used as a bridgehead for the invasion of Cuba, and will restrain those\n> who would plan to carry an aggression against Cuba, either from US territory\n> or from the territory of other countries neighboring to Cuba.[110]:103\n\nKennedy's planned statement would also contain suggestions he had received\nfrom his adviser Schlesinger Jr. in a \"Memorandum for the President\"\ndescribing the \"Post Mortem on Cuba.\"[111]\n\nKennedy's Oval Office telephone conversation with Eisenhower soon after\nKhrushchev's message arrived revealed that the President was planning to use\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis to escalate tensions with Khrushchev[112] and in the\nlong run, Cuba as well.[112] The President also claimed that he thought the\ncrisis would result in direct military confrontations in Berlin by the end of\nthe next month.[112] He also claimed in his conversation with Eisenhower that\nthe Soviet leader had offered to withdraw from Cuba in exchange for the\nwithdrawal of missiles from Turkey and that while the Kennedy Administration\nhad agreed not to invade Cuba,[112] they were only in process of determining\nKhrushchev's offer to withdraw from Turkey.[112]\n\nWhen former US President [Harry Truman](/wiki/Harry_Truman \"Harry Truman\")\ncalled President Kennedy the day of Khrushchev's offer, the President informed\nhim that his Administration had rejected the Soviet leader's offer to withdraw\nmissiles from Turkey and was planning on using the Soviet setback in Cuba to\nescalate tensions in Berlin.[113]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/Herblock.gif/220px-\nHerblock.gif)](/wiki/File:Herblock.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Herblock.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Herblock](/wiki/Herblock \"Herblock\") cartoon in _Washington Post_ , (November\n1962)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Removal_of_Missiles_in_Cuba_November_11%2C_1962_-_NARA_-_193868.tif/lossy-\npage1-220px-\nRemoval_of_Missiles_in_Cuba_November_11%2C_1962_-_NARA_-_193868.tif.jpg)](/wiki/File:Removal_of_Missiles_in_Cuba_November_11,_1962_-_NARA_-_193868.tif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Removal_of_Missiles_in_Cuba_November_11,_1962_-_NARA_-_193868.tif\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nRemoval of Missiles in Cuba November 11, 1962 – NARA – 193868\n\nThe US continued the blockade; in the following days, aerial reconnaissance\nproved that the Soviets were making progress in removing the missile systems.\nThe 42 missiles and their support equipment were loaded onto eight Soviet\nships. On November 2, 1962, Kennedy addressed the US via radio and television\nbroadcasts regarding the dismantlement process of the Soviet\n[R-12](/wiki/SS-4_Sandal \"SS-4 Sandal\") missile bases located in the Caribbean\nregion.[114] The ships left Cuba on November 5 to 9. The US made a final\nvisual check as each of the ships passed the blockade line. Further diplomatic\nefforts were required to remove the Soviet IL-28 bombers, and they were loaded\non three Soviet ships on December 5 and 6. Concurrent with the Soviet\ncommitment on the IL-28s, the US government announced the end of the blockade\nfrom 6:45 pm EST on November 20, 1962.[48]\n\nAt the time when the Kennedy administration thought that the Cuban Missile\nCrisis was resolved, nuclear tactical rockets stayed in Cuba since they were\nnot part of the Kennedy-Khrushchev understandings and the Americans did not\nknow about them. However, the Soviets changed their minds, fearing possible\nfuture Cuban militant steps, and on November 22, 1962, [Deputy Premier of the\nSoviet Union](/wiki/Deputy_Premier_of_the_Soviet_Union \"Deputy Premier of the\nSoviet Union\") [Anastas Mikoyan](/wiki/Anastas_Mikoyan \"Anastas Mikoyan\") told\nCastro that the rockets with the nuclear warheads were being removed as\nwell.[13]\n\nIn his negotiations with the Soviet Ambassador [Anatoly\nDobrynin](/wiki/Anatoly_Dobrynin \"Anatoly Dobrynin\"), Robert Kennedy\ninformally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed\n\"within a short time after this crisis was over.\"[115]:222 The last U.S.\nmissiles were disassembled by April 24, 1963 and were flown out of Turkey soon\nafterward.[116]\n\nThe practical effect of the Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that the US would not\ninvade Cuba. It is possible that Khrushchev placed the missiles in Cuba only\nto get Kennedy to remove the missiles from Italy and Turkey and that the\nSoviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned\nby the U.S.[117] Because the withdrawal of the Jupiter missiles from NATO\nbases in Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time, Khrushchev appeared\nto have lost the conflict and become weakened. The perception was that Kennedy\nhad won the contest between the superpowers and that Khrushchev had been\nhumiliated. However, both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avoid full\nconflict despite pressures from their respective governments. Khrushchev held\npower for another two years.[110]:102–105\n\n##\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Jupiter_IRBM.jpg/220px-\nJupiter_IRBM.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jupiter_IRBM.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jupiter_IRBM.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe nuclear-armed [Jupiter](/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter \"PGM-19 Jupiter\")\nintermediate-range ballistic missile. The US secretly agreed to withdraw the\nmissiles from Italy and Turkey.\n\n### Soviet\nleadership[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Soviet leadership\")]\n\nThe enormity of how close the world came to thermonuclear war impelled\nKrushchev to propose a far-reaching easing of tensions with the US.[118] In a\nletter to President Kennedy dated 30 October 1962, Krushchev outlined a range\nof bold initiatives to forestall the possibility of a further nuclear crisis,\nincluding proposing a non-aggression treaty between the [North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization](/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization \"North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization\") (NATO) and the [Warsaw Pact](/wiki/Warsaw_Pact \"Warsaw Pact\")\nor even the disbanding these military blocs, a treaty to cease all nuclear\nweapons testing and even the elimination of all nuclear weapons, resolution of\nthe hot-button issue of Germany by both East and West formally accepting the\nexistence of [West Germany](/wiki/West_Germany \"West Germany\") and [East\nGermany](/wiki/East_Germany \"East Germany\"), and US recognition of the\ngovernment of mainland China. The letter invited counter-proposals and further\nexploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations.\nKrushschev invited [Norman Cousins](/wiki/Norman_Cousins \"Norman Cousins\"),\nthe editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to\nserve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Krushchev for\nfour hours in December 1962.[119]\n\nKennedy's response to Krushchev's proposals was lukewarm but Kennedy expressed\nto Cousins that he felt constrained in exploring these issues due to pressure\nfrom hardliners in the US national security apparatus. The US and the USSR did\nshortly thereafter agree on a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear\nweapons, known as the \"[Partial Nuclear Test Ban\nTreaty](/wiki/Partial_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty \"Partial Nuclear Test Ban\nTreaty\")\".[120]\n\nFurther after the crisis, the U.S. and the Soviet Union created the\n[Moscow–Washington hotline](/wiki/Moscow%E2%80%93Washington_hotline\n\"Moscow–Washington hotline\"), a direct communications link between Moscow and\nWashington. The purpose was to have a way that the leaders of the two Cold War\ncountries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis.\n\nThe compromise embarrassed [Khrushchev](/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev \"Nikita\nKhrushchev\") and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from\n[Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\") and [Turkey](/wiki/Turkey \"Turkey\") was a secret\ndeal between Kennedy and Khrushchev. Khrushchev went to Kennedy as he thought\nthat the crisis was getting out of hand, but the Soviets were seen as\nretreating from circumstances that they had started.\n\nKhrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the\n[Soviet Politburo](/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union\n\"Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\")'s embarrassment at\nboth Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and this ineptitude in\nprecipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top\nSoviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering\non humiliation.\"[121]\n\n### Cuban\nleadership[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Cuban leadership\")]\n\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how\nto resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev.\nCastro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as\nthe status of the US Naval Base in Guantánamo, were not addressed. That caused\nCuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come.[122]:278 On the other\nhand, Cuba continued to be protected from invasion.\n\n### US\nleadership[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: US leadership\")]\n\nThe worldwide U.S. Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on November\n20, 1962. General Curtis LeMay told the President that the resolution of the\ncrisis was the \"greatest defeat in our history\", however his was a minority\nposition.[41] He had pressed for an immediate invasion of Cuba as soon as the\ncrisis began and still favored invading Cuba even after the Soviets had\nwithdrawn their missiles.[123] Twenty-five years later, LeMay still believed\nthat \"We could have gotten not only the missiles out of Cuba, we could have\ngotten the Communists out of Cuba at that time.\"[71]\n\nCritics, including Seymour Melman,[124] and Seymour Hersh [125] suggested that\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis encouraged the United States' use of military means,\nsuch as the case in the later [Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\").\n\n### Human\ncasualties[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Human casualties\")]\n\nU-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full\nmilitary honors in [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\"). He\nwas the first recipient of the newly created [Air Force\nCross](/wiki/Air_Force_Cross_\\(United_States\\) \"Air Force Cross \\(United\nStates\\)\"), which was awarded posthumously. Although Anderson was the only\ncombatant fatality during the crisis, 11 crew members of three reconnaissance\nBoeing [RB-47 Stratojets](/wiki/RB-47_Stratojet \"RB-47 Stratojet\") of the 55th\nStrategic Reconnaissance Wing were also killed in crashes during the period\nbetween September 27 and November 11, 1962.[126] Seven crew died when a\n[Military Air Transport Service](/wiki/Military_Air_Transport_Service\n\"Military Air Transport Service\") Boeing [C-135B\nStratolifter](/wiki/Boeing_C-135_Stratolifter \"Boeing C-135 Stratolifter\")\ndelivering ammunition to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base stalled and crashed on\napproach on October 23.[127]\n\n## Later\nrevelations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Later revelations\")]\n\nSchlesinger, a historian and adviser to Kennedy, told [National Public\nRadio](/wiki/National_Public_Radio \"National Public Radio\") in an interview on\nOctober 16, 2002 that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev\npressured Castro to accept them. Castro was not completely happy with the\nidea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both\nto protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union.[122]:272\nSchlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, Castro was more\nangry with Khrushchev than with Kennedy because Khrushchev had not consulted\nCastro before deciding to remove them.[note 2] Although Castro was infuriated\nby Khrushchev, he planned on striking the US with remaining missiles if an\ninvasion of the island occurred.[122]:311\n\nIn early 1992, it was confirmed that Soviet forces in Cuba had, when the\ncrisis broke, already received tactical nuclear warheads for their [artillery\nrockets](/wiki/Rocket_artillery \"Rocket artillery\") and [Il-28\nbombers](/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-28 \"Ilyushin Il-28\").[128] Castro stated that he\nwould have recommended their use if the US invaded despite Cuba being\ndestroyed.[128]\n\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the\nCuban Missile Crisis Havana conference, in October 2002. Attended by many of\nthe veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on October 27, 1962, [USS\n_Beale_](/wiki/USS_Beale_\\(DD-471\\) \"USS Beale \\(DD-471\\)\") had tracked and\ndropped signaling depth charges (the size of hand grenades) on\n[_B-59_](/wiki/Soviet_submarine_B-59 \"Soviet submarine B-59\"), a Soviet\nProject 641 (NATO designation [Foxtrot](/wiki/Foxtrot-class_submarine\n\"Foxtrot-class submarine\")) submarine. Unknown to the US, it was armed with a\n15-kiloton nuclear torpedo.[129] Running out of air, the Soviet submarine was\nsurrounded by American warships and desperately needed to surface. An argument\nbroke out among three officers aboard _B-59_ , including submarine captain\nValentin Savitsky, political officer Ivan Semonovich Maslennikov, and Deputy\nbrigade commander Captain 2nd rank (U.S. Navy Commander rank equivalent)\n[Vasili Arkhipov](/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov \"Vasili Arkhipov\"). An exhausted\nSavitsky became furious and ordered that the nuclear torpedo on board be made\ncombat ready. Accounts differ about whether Arkhipov convinced Savitsky not to\nmake the attack or whether Savitsky himself finally concluded that the only\nreasonable choice left open to him was to come to the surface.[130]:303, 317\nDuring the conference, McNamara stated that nuclear war had come much closer\nthan people had thought. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security\nArchive, said, \"A guy called [Vasili Arkhipov](/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov \"Vasili\nArkhipov\") saved the world.\"\n\nFifty years after the crisis, [Graham T.

We\n> now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear-armed ballistic missiles,\n> the Soviet Union had deployed 100 tactical nuclear weapons to Cuba, and the\n> local Soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without\n> additional codes or commands from Moscow. The US air strike and invasion\n> that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely\n> have triggered a nuclear response against American ships and troops, and\n> perhaps even [Miami](/wiki/Miami \"Miami\"). The resulting war might have led\n> to the deaths of over 100 million Americans and over 100 million\n> Russians.[131][132]\n\n[BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\") journalist Joe Matthews published the story, on October\n13, 2012, behind the 100 tactical nuclear warheads mentioned by Graham Allison\nin the excerpt above.[133] Khrushchev feared that Castro's hurt pride and\nwidespread Cuban indignation over the concessions he had made to Kennedy might\nlead to a breakdown of the agreement between the Soviet Union and the US. To\nprevent that, Khrushchev decided to offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical\nnuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range\nmissiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of U.S. intelligence.\nKhrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles\non their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba would be in the Soviet Union's\ninterests.[133]\n\n[Anastas Mikoyan](/wiki/Anastas_Mikoyan \"Anastas Mikoyan\") was tasked with the\nnegotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal that was designed to\nprevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While\nin Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was\nconvinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the US at the expense of\nCuba's defense. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his\nmilitary not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100\nHiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly\nintractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22,\n1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite\nMoscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law,\nwhich did not actually exist, to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban\nhands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was\nforced to give way and, much to the relief of Khrushchev and the rest of the\nSoviet government, the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by\nsea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.[133]\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: In popular culture\")]\n\nThe American popular media, especially television, made heavy use of the\nevents of the missile crisis and both fictional and documentary forms.[134]\nJim Willis includes the Crisis as one of the 100 \"media moments that changed\nAmerica.\"[135] Sheldon Stern finds that a half century later there are still\nmany \"misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies\" that have shaped media\nversions of what happened in the White House during those harrowing two\nweeks.[136]\n\nAccording to William Cohn, television programs are typically the main source\nused by the American public to know about and interpret the past.[137] The\nSoviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a\ncoherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the\nstory. Cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic David against the American\nGoliath. One contradiction that pervaded the Soviet media campaign was between\nthe pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement that emphasizes the horrors of\nnuclear war and the militancy of the need to prepare Soviets for war against\nAmerican aggression.[138]\n\n### Media\nrepresentations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cuban_Missile_Crisis&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Media representations\")]\n\n(Listed chronologically)\n\n  * _[Thirteen Days](/wiki/Thirteen_Days_\\(book\\) \"Thirteen Days \\(book\\)\")_ , Robert F.
