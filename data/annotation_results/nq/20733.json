On 18 March, it\nlaunched an attack from a position 100 mi (160 km) southeast of the island of\n[Kyūshū](/wiki/Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB \"Kyūshū\").

The Japanese located the American task force on 21 March,\nsending 48 planes to attack the ships. Twenty-four\n[fighters](/wiki/Fighter_aircraft \"Fighter aircraft\") from the task force\nintercepted and shot down all the Japanese aircraft.\n\nPre-invasion bombardment of Okinawa began on 24 March. _Indianapolis_ spent 7\ndays pouring 8-inch shells into the beach defenses. During this time, enemy\naircraft repeatedly attacked the American ships. _Indianapolis_ shot down six\nplanes and damaged two others.

In October 2000, the [United States\nCongress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") passed a\nresolution that Captain McVay's record should state that \"he is\n[exonerated](/wiki/Exoneration \"Exoneration\") for the loss of _Indianapolis_\n\".

Four\n_Indianapolis_ survivors accompanied the expedition, which was not successful.\nIn June 2005, a second expedition was mounted to find the wreck. _[National\nGeographic](/wiki/National_Geographic_\\(magazine\\) \"National Geographic\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ covered the story and released it in July.\n[Submersibles](/wiki/Submersible \"Submersible\") were launched to find any sign\nof wreckage. The only objects ever found, which have not been confirmed to\nhave belonged to _Indianapolis_ , were numerous pieces of metal of varying\nsize found in the area of the reported sinking position (this was included in\nthe National Geographic program \"Finding of the USS _Indianapolis_ \").\n\nIn July 2016, new information came out regarding the possible location of\n_Indianapolis_ when naval records said that\n[_LST-779_](/w/index.php?title=USS_LST-779&action=edit&redlink=1 \"USS LST-779\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") passed by the ship 11 hours before the torpedoes\nstruck. Using this information, _National Geographic_ planned to mount an\nexpedition to search for the wreck in the summer of 2017.[39] Reports\nestimated that _Indianapolis_ was actually 25 mi (40 km) west of the reported\nsinking position, in water over three mi (4,800 m) deep, and likely on the\nside of an underwater mountain.[40]\n\nA year after the discovery of the records, the wreck was located by [Paul\nAllen](/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\")’s \"USS _Indianapolis_ Project\" aboard\nResearch Vessel _Petrel_ [41] on 19 August 2017, at a depth of 18,000 feet\n(5,500 m).[42] The wreck is well preserved due to the great depth at which\n_Indianapolis_ rests, which is the rocky mountain ranges of the North\nPhilippine Sea.[43]\n\nIn September 2017, a map detailing the wreckage was released. The main part of\nthe wreck lies in an impact crater. Its bow, which broke off before the ship\nsank, lies 1.5 miles (2.4 km) east. The two forward 8-inch guns, which also\nbroke off on the surface and mark the ship's last position on the surface, lie\n0.5 miles (0.80 km) east of the main wreck. The single 8-inch gun turret on\nthe stern remains in place. Airplane wreckage from the ship lies about 0.6\nmiles (0.97 km) north of the main part of the wreck.[44]\n\n##\nReunions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=USS_Indianapolis_\\(CA-35\\)&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Reunions\")]\n\nSince 1960, surviving crew members have been meeting for reunions in\nIndianapolis. For the 70th reunion, held 23–26 July 2015, 14 of the 32\nremaining survivors attended. The reunions are open to anyone interested, and\nhave more attendees each year, even as the number of survivors decreases from\ndeath. Held only periodically at first, biannually later on, the reunions have\nbeen held annually for the past several years. Every year, the survivors, most\nof them in their nineties, vote whether to continue.[45][46][47] Seven out of\ntwenty living survivors attended the 2017 reunion.[48]\n\n## Popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=USS_Indianapolis_\\(CA-35\\)&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Popular culture\")]\n\nReferences to the _Indianapolis_ sinking and aftermath have been adapted to\nfilm, stage, television, and popular culture. The incident itself was the\nsubject of a 1991 [made-for-television](/wiki/Made-for-television \"Made-for-\ntelevision\") movie _Mission of the Shark: The Saga of the USS Indianapolis_ ,\nwith [Stacy Keach](/wiki/Stacy_Keach \"Stacy Keach\") portraying [Captain\nCharles Butler McVay III](/wiki/Charles_Butler_McVay_III \"Charles Butler McVay\nIII\").\n\nProbably the most well known fictional reference to the events occurs in the\n1975 thriller film _[Jaws](/wiki/Jaws_\\(film\\) \"Jaws \\(film\\)\")_ in a\n[monologue](/wiki/Monologue \"Monologue\") by actor [Robert\nShaw](/wiki/Robert_Shaw_\\(British_actor\\) \"Robert Shaw \\(British actor\\)\"),\nwhose character Quint is depicted as a survivor of the _Indianapolis_ sinking.\nThe monologue emphasizes the numerous deaths caused by shark attacks after the\nsinking. [John Milius](/wiki/John_Milius \"John Milius\") was specifically\nbrought into the production to write lines for this scene and he based them on\nsurvivor stories. However, there are several historical inaccuracies in the\nmonologue: The speech states the date of the sinking as 29 June 1945, when the\nship was actually sunk just after midnight on 30 July. The speech further\nstates that 1,100 men went into the water and 316 came out (321 came out, of\nwhom 317 survived) and that because of the secrecy of the atom bomb mission no\ndistress call was broadcast, while declassified Navy documents prove that the\nsignal had been sent but did not elicit a response.[49]\n\nA few years after the release of _Jaws_ , co-writer [Howard\nSackler](/wiki/Howard_Sackler \"Howard Sackler\") proposed making a prequel film\nbased on the sinking of _Indianapolis_. The idea was ultimately rejected by\nthen-[Universal Studios](/wiki/Universal_Studios \"Universal Studios\")\npresident [Sidney Sheinberg](/wiki/Sidney_Sheinberg \"Sidney Sheinberg\"); the\nfilm instead would eventually go on to become the sequel _[Jaws\n2](/wiki/Jaws_2 \"Jaws 2\")_.[50]\n\nScience fiction writer [Jack Chalker](/wiki/Jack_Chalker \"Jack Chalker\")'s\nhistorical novel _[The Devil's Voyage](/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Voyage \"The Devil's\nVoyage\")_ (1980) centers on the sinking of _Indianapolis_.\n\nSara Vladic directed _USS Indianapolis: The Legacy,_ which tells the fate of\nUSS _Indianapolis_ using exclusively first-person accounts from the survivors\nof the sinking. This film was released in December 2015.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n_[USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage](/wiki/USS_Indianapolis:_Men_of_Courage\n\"USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage\")_ , starring [Nicolas\nCage](/wiki/Nicolas_Cage \"Nicolas Cage\"), was released in October 2016, with\n[Mario Van Peebles](/wiki/Mario_Van_Peebles \"Mario Van Peebles\")\ndirecting.[51][52]\n\nIn _[The Burning Mountain](/wiki/The_Burning_Mountain \"The Burning\nMountain\"),_ an alternate history of the aborted invasion of Japan by [Alfred\nCoppel](/wiki/Alfred_Coppel \"Alfred Coppel\"), USS _Bethlehem_ is based on the\nsecret mission and sinking of USS _Indianapolis._[53]\n\n###\nMemorials[[edit](/w/index.php?title=USS_Indianapolis_\\(CA-35\\)&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Memorials\")]\n\nSee also: [U.S. Navy Museum § Other\nmuseums](/wiki/U.S._Navy_Museum#Other_museums \"U.S. Navy Museum\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/USS_Indianapolis_%28CA-35%29_Memorial.jpg/220px-\nUSS_Indianapolis_%28CA-35%29_Memorial.jpg)](/wiki/File:USS_Indianapolis_\\(CA-35\\)_Memorial.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:USS_Indianapolis_\\(CA-35\\)_Memorial.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUSS _Indianapolis_ National Memorial\n\nThe USS _Indianapolis_ Museum had its grand opening on 7 July 2007, with its\ngallery in the Indiana War Memorial Museum at the [Indiana World War Memorial\nPlaza](/wiki/Indiana_World_War_Memorial_Plaza#Indiana_World_War_Memorial_Military_Museum\n\"Indiana World War Memorial Plaza\").[54]\n\nThe USS _Indianapolis_ National Memorial was dedicated on 2 August 1995.
