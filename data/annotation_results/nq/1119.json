Where it is\njoined by the [Ouachita River](/wiki/Ouachita_River \"Ouachita River\"), its\nlargest tributary, the river later broadens into a complex network of\nmarshlands surrounding the Mississippi and\n[Atchafalaya](/wiki/Atchafalaya_River \"Atchafalaya River\") rivers. Its waters\neventually discharge into the Atchafalaya River[5] and flow eastward or\nsouthward into the [Gulf of Mexico](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of Mexico\").\n\nIn 1946, the Red River flood spilled over into Pineville because of\ninsufficient levee height and strength.

Its drainage basin is mostly in the states of Texas and\nOklahoma, but also covers parts of Arkansas and Louisiana. Its basin is\ncharacterized by flat, fertile [agricultural](/wiki/Agricultural\n\"Agricultural\") land, with only a few major cities. The drainage basin of the\nRed River is very arid and receives little\n[precipitation](/wiki/Precipitation_\\(meteorology\\) \"Precipitation\n\\(meteorology\\)\"). As a result, much of the river above the Texas-Oklahoma\nborder is intermittent, and until the river is past its great bend south in\nArkansas, the flow varies widely. Most of the agriculture in the basin is\nsustained by [groundwater](/wiki/Groundwater \"Groundwater\"), which is\nrecharged with rainfall and riverflow. The lower course of the river flows\nthrough a series of [marshes](/wiki/Marsh \"Marsh\") and [swamps](/wiki/Swamp\n\"Swamp\"), where its flow is dramatically moderated.\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_River_of_the_South&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Native\nAmericans[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_River_of_the_South&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Native Americans\")]\n\nNative American cultures along the river were diverse, developing specialized\nadaptations to the many different environments.[3] By the time of\n[European](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\") contact, the eastern [Piney\nWoods](/wiki/Piney_Woods \"Piney Woods\") were dominated by the numerous\nhistoric tribes of the [Caddoan](/wiki/Caddoan \"Caddoan\") Confederacy. They\nfound plentiful game and fish, and also had good land for cultivating staple\ncrops.[3] The middle part of the Red River was dominated by\n[Wichita](/wiki/Wichita_people \"Wichita people\") and [Tonkawa](/wiki/Tonkawa\n\"Tonkawa\"). This area was [prairie](/wiki/Prairie \"Prairie\"), where Native\nAmericans constructed portable and temporary [tepees](/wiki/Tepee \"Tepee\") for\nhousing. They practiced limited farming and followed game in seasonal,\n[nomadic](/wiki/Nomadic \"Nomadic\") hunting cycles.[3] The Plains division of\nthe [Lipan Apache](/wiki/Lipan_Apache_people \"Lipan Apache people\") dominated\nthe western Red River area until the 18th century, when they were displaced by\ninvading [Comanche](/wiki/Comanche \"Comanche\") from the north.[3]\n\n### European-American exploration and\nsettlement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_River_of_the_South&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: European-American exploration and settlement\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Theb0771_-_Flickr_-\n_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg/220px-Theb0771_-_Flickr_-\n_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg)](/wiki/File:Theb0771_-_Flickr_-\n_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Theb0771_-_Flickr_-_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCrossing the Red River near [Granite, Oklahoma](/wiki/Granite,_Oklahoma\n\"Granite, Oklahoma\"), 1921.\n\nIn 1806, President [Thomas Jefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas\nJefferson\") commissioned the [Red River\nExpedition](/wiki/Red_River_Expedition_\\(1806\\) \"Red River Expedition\n\\(1806\\)\") to explore parts of the new lands of the [Louisiana\nPurchase](/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase \"Louisiana Purchase\") by traveling up the\nRed River. He said it was \"in truth, next to the Missouri, the most\ninteresting water of the Mississippi\", in a letter to [William\nDunbar](/wiki/William_Dunbar \"William Dunbar\").[7] Having threaded the maze of\n[bayous](/wiki/Bayous \"Bayous\") at the river's confluence, and the \"[Great\nRaft](/wiki/Great_Raft \"Great Raft\")\" of lodged driftwood, the expedition, was\nstopped by the [Spanish](/wiki/Colonial_Mexico \"Colonial Mexico\") near what is\nnow [New Boston, Texas](/wiki/New_Boston,_Texas \"New Boston, Texas\").\n\nIn 1806, Lieutenant [Zebulon Pike](/wiki/Zebulon_Pike \"Zebulon Pike\"), under\norders to ascertain the source of the Red River, ascended the [Arkansas\nRiver](/wiki/Arkansas_River \"Arkansas River\"), made his way downstream on what\nturned out to be the [Rio Grande](/wiki/Rio_Grande \"Rio Grande\"), and was sent\nhome by the Spanish authorities. A more successful exploration of the river's\nupper reaches to both its sources was the 1852 expedition under Capt.\n[Randolph Barnes Marcy](/wiki/Randolph_Barnes_Marcy \"Randolph Barnes Marcy\"),\nassisted by Brevet Capt. [George B. McClellan](/wiki/George_B._McClellan\n\"George B. McClellan\").[8] The latter was important as a general in the\n[American Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\").\n\nIn April 1815, Captain Henry Miller Shreve was the first person to bring a\nsteamboat, the _Enterprise_ , up the Red River. Fulton and Livingston, who\nclaimed the exclusive right to navigate Louisiana waters by steamboat, sued\nShreve in the District Court of New Orleans. The judge ruled that the monopoly\nclaimed by the plaintiffs was illegal. That decision, along with a similar\noutcome in _Gibbons v. Ogden_ freed navigation on every river, lake or harbor\nin the United States from interference by monopolies.[9]\n\nWhen John Quincy Adams became Secretary of State in 1817, one of his highest\npriorities was to negotiate the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase with\nSpain. He negotiated with the Spanish Minister to the United States, [Luis de\nOnis](/wiki/Luis_de_Onis \"Luis de Onis\"), and finally concluded [Adams-Onis\nTreaty](/wiki/Adams-Onis_Treaty \"Adams-Onis Treaty\"), also known as the Treaty\nof 1819. The treaty defined the south bank of the river as the boundary\nbetween the United States and Spain. That boundary continued to be recognized\nwhen Mexico gained its independence from Spain, then again when Texas became\nindependent from Mexico. It remained so [9] until the United States Congress\nconsented to the Red River Boundary Compact adopted by the states of Oklahoma\nand Texas, which set the jurisdictional boundary between Texas and Oklahoma at\nthe vegetation line on the south bank, but left title of adjacent property\nowners at the south bank.\n\nIn Louisiana, the area of present-day [Natchitoches\nParish](/wiki/Natchitoches_Parish \"Natchitoches Parish\") was settled by French\nCreole and mixed-race [Louisiana Creole people](/wiki/Louisiana_Creole_people\n\"Louisiana Creole people\"), starting before 1800. The [Cane River National\nHeritage Area](/wiki/Cane_River_National_Heritage_Area \"Cane River National\nHeritage Area\") marks this area of influence, with\n[plantations](/wiki/Plantations_in_the_American_South \"Plantations in the\nAmerican South\") and churches founded by Louisiana Creoles. Some of the sites\nare designated as destinations on the [Louisiana African American Heritage\nTrail](/wiki/Louisiana_African_American_Heritage_Trail \"Louisiana African\nAmerican Heritage Trail\"), designed in the 21st century. For nearly 100 years\nafter the [American Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\"),\nsome of the plantations were the center of a large [African\nAmerican](/wiki/African_American \"African American\") and Creole community\nlife, whose people lived and worked in this area for generations.\n\nThe area along the lower Red River of [Grant Parish,\nLouisiana](/wiki/Grant_Parish,_Louisiana \"Grant Parish, Louisiana\"), and\nneighboring parishes were a mixture of hill country and cotton plantations,\nwith white [planters](/wiki/Planter_\\(American_South\\) \"Planter \\(American\nSouth\\)\") and subsistence farmers, and numerous African American\n[slaves](/wiki/Slaves \"Slaves\") working the plantations in the _ante bellum_\nyears. It was an area of heated social tensions and\n[insurgency](/wiki/Insurgency \"Insurgency\") during and after the\n[Reconstruction era](/wiki/Reconstruction_era_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Reconstruction era \\(United States\\)\"). Grant was a new parish created by the\nReconstruction legislature, which was trying to increase [Republican\nParty](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party \\(United\nStates\\)\") representation. In 1873, Grant Parish was the site of the [Colfax\nmassacre](/wiki/Colfax_massacre \"Colfax massacre\"), caused by the political\ntension and violence arising from the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election and\nefforts by local whites to keep white supremacy. White\n[militias](/wiki/Militias \"Militias\"), organized from nearby parishes, killed\nmore than 100 freedmen, some of whom had surrendered as prisoners.\n\nIn 1874, such militias organized as the [White League](/wiki/White_League\n\"White League\") in Grant Parish, and other chapters were soon founded across\nthe state. The [Coushatta Massacre](/wiki/Coushatta_Massacre \"Coushatta\nMassacre\") was attributed to the White League, which attacked Republican\nofficeholders to run them out of office. The paramilitary groups intimidated\nand terrorized freedmen to keep them from the polls, and by the late 1870s,\nconservative [Democrats](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic\nParty \\(United States\\)\") had retaken political control of the state.\n\n### Great\nRaft[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_River_of_the_South&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Great Raft\")]\n\nMain article: [Great Raft](/wiki/Great_Raft \"Great Raft\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Red_River_Texas.jpg/220px-\nRed_River_Texas.jpg)](/wiki/File:Red_River_Texas.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Red_River_Texas.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRed River, Texas\n\nIn the early 19th century, settlers found that much of the river's length in\n[Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\") was unnavigable because of a\ncollection of fallen trees that formed a \"Great Raft\" over 160 miles (260 km)\nlong. Captain [Henry Miller Shreve](/wiki/Henry_Miller_Shreve \"Henry Miller\nShreve\") began clearing the log jam in 1839. The log jam was not completely\ncleared until the 1870s, when [dynamite](/wiki/Dynamite \"Dynamite\") became\navailable. The river was thereafter navigable, but north of\n[Natchitoches](/wiki/Natchitoches,_Louisiana \"Natchitoches, Louisiana\") it was\nrestricted to small craft. Removal of the raft further connected the Red and\nAtchafalaya rivers, accelerating the development of the Atchafalaya River\nchannel.[5]\n\nIn the 20th century, the [interest group](/wiki/Interest_group \"Interest\ngroup\") known as the Red River Valley Association was formed to lobby the\n[United States Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States\nCongress\") to make the river fully navigable between\n[Alexandria](/wiki/Alexandria,_Louisiana \"Alexandria, Louisiana\") and\n[Shreveport, Louisiana](/wiki/Shreveport,_Louisiana \"Shreveport, Louisiana\").\nLeading supporters of the longstanding project were Louisiana\n[Democratic](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party\n\\(United States\\)\") senators [Allen J.
