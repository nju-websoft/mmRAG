It continued the\nproduction of Russo-Balt cars and launched a new model on October 8, 1922,\nwhile AMO built FIAT 15 Ter trucks under licence and released a more modern\nFIAT-derived truck developed by a team of AMO designers, the AMO-F-15. About\n6,000–6,500 F-15s were built in the years 1924–1931.[12][13]\n\nIn 1927, engineers from the [Scientific Automobile & Motor\nInstitute](/wiki/Central_Scientific_Research_Automobile_and_Automotive_Engines_Institute\n\"Central Scientific Research Automobile and Automotive Engines Institute\")\n(NAMI) created the first original Soviet car NAMI-I, which was produced in\nsmall numbers by the Spartak State Automobile Factory in Moscow, between 1927\nand 1931.[14] In 1929, due to a rapidly growing demand for automobiles and in\ncooperation with its trade partner, the [Ford Motor\nCompany](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford Motor Company\"), the [Supreme Soviet\nof the National Economy](/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_National_Economy \"Supreme\nSoviet of the National Economy\") established [GAZ](/wiki/GAZ \"GAZ\").[15][16] A\nyear later, a second automobile plant was founded in [Moscow](/wiki/Moscow\n\"Moscow\"), which would become a major Soviet car maker after [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") and earn nationwide fame under the name\n[Moskvitch](/wiki/Moskvitch \"Moskvitch\").\n\nThe beginning of the 1960s saw the release of the [Moskvitch\n408](/wiki/Moskvitch_408 \"Moskvitch 408\"), intended to be an [economy\ncar](/wiki/Economy_car \"Economy car\") that would spread the use of cars among\nthe population.[17] Other manufacturers such as MZMA, GAZ and ZAZ were\noffering a variety of cars intended for the mass market. The Soviet government\nopted to build an even larger car manufacturing plant that would produce a\npeople's car and help to meet the demand for personal transport.[18] For\nreasons of cost-efficiency, it was decided to produce the car on the basis of\nan existing, modern foreign model. After considering several options, the\n[Fiat 124](/wiki/FIAT_124 \"FIAT 124\") was chosen because of its simple and\nsturdy design, being easy to manufacture and repair.\n\nThe plant was built in just 4 years (1966–1970) in the small town of\n[Stavropol\nVolzhsky](/w/index.php?title=Stavropol_Volzhsky&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Stavropol Volzhsky \\(page does not exist\\)\"), which later grew to a\npopulation of more than half a million and was renamed\n[Togliatti](/wiki/Tolyatti \"Tolyatti\") to commemorate [Palmiro\nTogliatti](/wiki/Palmiro_Togliatti \"Palmiro Togliatti\").[18][19] At the same\ntime, the [Izhmash](/wiki/Lada_Izhevsk \"Lada Izhevsk\") car plant was\nestablished in the city of [Izhevsk](/wiki/Izhevsk \"Izhevsk\") as part of the\nIzhevsk Mechanical Plant, with the initiative coming from the [Minister of\nDefence](/wiki/Dmitriy_Ustinov \"Dmitriy Ustinov\")[20] and in order to increase\nthe overall production of cars in the Soviet Union. It produced\n[Moskvitchs](/wiki/Moskvitch \"Moskvitch\") and Moskvitch-based [_kombi_\nhatchbacks](/wiki/Izh_2125 \"Izh 2125\"). [KaMAZ](/wiki/KaMAZ \"KaMAZ\"), Europe's\nlargest heavy truck plant, was built in [Naberezhnye\nChelny](/wiki/Naberezhnye_Chelny \"Naberezhnye Chelny\"), while [GAZ](/wiki/GAZ\n\"GAZ\"), [ZIL](/wiki/ZiL \"ZiL\"), [UralAZ](/wiki/Ural_Automotive_Plant \"Ural\nAutomotive Plant\"), [KrAZ](/wiki/KrAZ \"KrAZ\"),\n[MAZ](/wiki/Minsk_Automobile_Plant \"Minsk Automobile Plant\"),\n[BelAZ](/wiki/BelAZ \"BelAZ\"), and plants continued to produce other types of\ntrucks.\n\nBy the early 1980s, Soviet automobile industry consisted of several main\nplants, which produced vehicles for various market segments. In late 1987, the\nindustry produced 2 million cars, satisfying 45% of the domestic demand.[21]\n\n### Post-Soviet\nadjustments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_industry_in_Russia&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Post-Soviet adjustments\")]\n\nIn the early 1990s the Russian car market expanded dramatically, largely due\nto a drastic cut on import duties, so that by 1993 foreign-made imported cars\nmade up 49% of all sales.[22] At the same time, Russian automakers were\nintegrated into a [market economy](/wiki/Market_economy \"Market economy\") and\nimmediately hit by a crisis due to the loss of financial support, economic\nturmoil, criminal activities[23][24][25] and stiffer competition in the\ndomestic market during the 1990s.\n\nThe main domestic manufacturers in the early 1990s were\n[AvtoVAZ](/wiki/AvtoVAZ \"AvtoVAZ\"), [AZLK](/wiki/AZLK \"AZLK\"),\n[IzhAvto](/wiki/IzhAvto \"IzhAvto\"), [GAZ](/wiki/GAZ \"GAZ\") and [UAZ](/wiki/UAZ\n\"UAZ\").[26] Some of them, like AvtoVAZ, turned to cooperation with other\ncompanies (such as [GM-AvtoVAZ](/wiki/GM-AvtoVAZ \"GM-AvtoVAZ\")) in order to\nobtain substantial capital investment and overcome the crisis.[27]\n\nBy 1993, total output was down 14% compared to 1990 levels. Lada's declining\nsales during the 1990s, and toughening [European Union](/wiki/European_Union\n\"European Union\") emissions requirements, saw exports to [Western\nEurope](/wiki/Western_Europe \"Western Europe\") discontinued by the end of the\ndecade. Lada had enjoyed particularly strong sales in Britain, peaking at more\nthan 30,000 sales a year in the late 1980s, but had failed to remain\ncompetitive with other budget brands over the subsequent few years.\n\n850,000 cars were sold in 1996.[28] As demand kept rising, local brands\ncontinued to be affected by a reputation for poor manufacturing quality. In\nwas estimated in 1996 that a newly bought AvtoVAZ car needed $1-2,000 worth of\nrepairs to bring it to a comfortable level of safety.[28]\n\nThe [1998 Russian financial crisis](/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis \"1998\nRussian financial crisis\") affected the industry, as car manufacturers stopped\nusing imported components because of higher import prices. Nevertheless, the\nindustry quickly recovered in subsequent years.[29]\n\nIn 1997, car production increased by 13.2% in comparison with 1996 and\nachieved 981,000. AvtoVAZ and UAZ extended their output by 8.8 and 52 percent\nrespectively, whereas KamAZ doubled it. The overall truck production in Russia\nincreased by 7 percent, reaching 148,000 in 1997[30] and 184,000 in 2000.[31]\nThe overall production of cars rose from about 800,000 in 1993 to more than\n1.16 million in 2000,[32] or 965,000[33] (969,235 according to\n[OICA](/wiki/Organisation_Internationale_des_Constructeurs_d%27Automobiles\n\"Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles\")[34]) excluding\ncommercial vehicles.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the unavailability of dealer financing meant that cars\nhad to be purchased in cash.[22]\n\n### 2000 to\n2008[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_industry_in_Russia&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 2000 to 2008\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%B5%D1%80_%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0_%27%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%27.jpg/220px-%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%B5%D1%80_%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0_%27%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%27.jpg)](/wiki/File:%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%B5%D1%80_%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0_%27%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%27.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%B5%D1%80_%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0_%27%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%27.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Lada Samara](/wiki/Lada_Samara \"Lada Samara\") assembly line in 2005\n\nIn the early 2000s, the [Russian economy](/wiki/Economy_of_Russia \"Economy of\nRussia\") recovered.

At the same time, [Severstal](/wiki/Severstal \"Severstal\") gained\ncontrol of [UAZ](/wiki/UAZ \"UAZ\").[35]\n\nIn 2001 Ford became the first western manufacturer to establish its own\nassembly plant in Russia, investing $150 million in their\n[Vsevolozhsk](/wiki/Vsevolozhsk \"Vsevolozhsk\") factory, manufacturing the\n[Ford Focus](/wiki/Ford_Focus \"Ford Focus\"), which briefly became the best-\nselling foreign-branded car in Russia.[36]\n\nIn 2003 Russian manufacturers still accounted for over 90% of car production\nin Russia, either under their own brand or in partnership with a foreign\ncompany. The six main automotive groups were [AvtoVAZ](/wiki/AvtoVAZ\n\"AvtoVAZ\"), [SOK Group](/wiki/SOK_Group \"SOK Group\"), [Kamaz](/wiki/Kamaz\n\"Kamaz\"), [RusPromAvto](/wiki/RusPromAvto \"RusPromAvto\"),\n[SeverstalAvto](/wiki/SeverstalAvto \"SeverstalAvto\") and [AZLK](/wiki/AZLK\n\"AZLK\").[37] Just 11,000 cars were locally assembled by foreign manufacturers\nin 2002.[38]\n\nMacroeconomic trends were strong and growing incomes of the population led to\na surging demand, and by 2005 the Russian car market was booming. In 2005,\n1,446,525 new cars were sold, including 832,200 Russian models and 614,325\nforeign ones.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2005, foreign-branded cars outsold local ones for\nthe first time in Russian history (including used imports).[36] Foreign\ncompanies started to massively invest in production in Russia: the number of\nforeign cars produced in the Russian Federation surged from 157,179 in 2005 to\n456,500 in 2007.[39] To keep up with the competition, local brands launched\nmore modern-looking models, such as [Lada Kalina](/wiki/Lada_Kalina \"Lada\nKalina\").[36]\n\nThe value of the Russian market grew at a brisk pace: 14% in 2005, 36% in 2006\nand 67% in 2007—making it the world's fastest growing automotive market by\n2008.[40] Foreign companies started flocking to enter Russia in the 2000s,\nseeing it as a local production location and export powerhouse. Russia's\nlabour, material and energy costs were only 1/6 compared to those in Western\nEurope.[41][42]\n\nTo boost the market share of locally produced vehicles, the [Russian\ngovernment](/wiki/Government_of_Russia \"Government of Russia\") implemented\nseveral [protectionist](/wiki/Protectionism \"Protectionism\") measures and\nlaunched programs to attract foreign producers into the country.

The benefits of\noperating in the special economic zones include tax allowances, exemption from\nasset and land taxes and protection against changes in the tax regime.

Lorry production fell from 256,000 to 91,000 in the same period.[43]\n\nIn late 2008, the Russian government introduced protectionist measures, worth\n$5 billion, to improve the situation in the industry. This included $2 billion\nof [bailouts](/wiki/Bailout \"Bailout\") for troubled companies and $3 billion\nof credits for buyers of Russian cars.[44] Prime minister [Vladimir\nPutin](/wiki/Vladimir_Putin \"Vladimir Putin\") described the move as vital in\norder to save jobs.[45] The tariffs for imported foreign cars and trucks were\nincreased to a minimum of 50% and go up to 100%. The tariffs are linked to the\nengine size of the vehicle. The increased duties led to protests in Russian\ncities, most notably in [Vladivostok](/wiki/Vladivostok \"Vladivostok\"), where\nthe importation of Japanese cars is an important sector of the city's\neconomy.[46] To compensate for the losses of the Vladivostok businesses, Prime\nMinister Putin ordered the car manufacturing company\n[Sollers](/wiki/Sollers_JSC \"Sollers JSC\") to move one of its factories from\n[Moscow](/wiki/Moscow \"Moscow\") to Vladivostok. The move was completed in\n2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It was planned to produce\n13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010.[47]\n\nThe most efficient anti-crisis measure executed by the Russian government was\nthe introduction of a [car scrappage scheme](/wiki/Car_scrappage_scheme \"Car\nscrappage scheme\") in March 2010. Under the scheme, buyers of new cars could\nreceive a subsidy of up to 600,000 rubles (20,000 USD).[48] Sales of Russia's\nlargest carmaker [Avtovaz](/wiki/Avtovaz \"Avtovaz\") doubled in the second\nquarter of 2010 as a result, and the company returned to profit.[49][50]\n\n### Recent\ndevelopments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_industry_in_Russia&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Recent developments\")]\n\nBy the end of 2010, automotive production had returned to pre-crisis\nlevels.[51][52] Nine out of the ten most sold models in Russia in 2010 were\ndomestically produced, with Avtovaz's Lada models topping the list.[51] In the\nfirst 7 months of 2010, sales of Lada cars increased by 60%, the Korean KIA\nreported a jump of 101%, and Chevrolet's sales rose by 15%.[53]\n\nIn 2010, Russia was the world's 15th largest producer of cars.

At the same time, the market share of foreign-branded cars made in\nRussia kept rising, reaching 45% in 2012.[55] Imported vehicles account for a\nsizable portion of the Russian automotive market: in 2014 they made up 27% of\ncars and 46% of trucks.[56]\n\nThe [2014 economic\ncrisis](/wiki/Russian_financial_crisis_\\(2014%E2%80%932017\\) \"Russian\nfinancial crisis \\(2014–2017\\)\") led to a new fall in car sales and production\nlevels, and reduced forecasts for future growth.[57]\n\nThe number of cars on Russian roads reached 40,629,200 in 2016.
