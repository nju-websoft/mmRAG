In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would\nclump together ([agglutinate](/wiki/Agglutination \"Agglutination\")) when mixed\nin test tubes, and not only that some human blood also agglutinated with\nanimal blood.[5] He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\n> The serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red cells,\n> but also often those of human origin, from other individuals. It remains to\n> be seen whether this appearance is related to inborn differences between\n> individuals or it is the result of some damage of bacterial kind.[6]\n\nThis was the first evidence that blood variation exists in humans – it was\nbelieved that all humans have similar blood. The next year, in 1901, he made a\ndefinitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate\nwith only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human\nbloods into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined\nthat group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type.\nSimilarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different\nin that it agglutinates with both A and B.[7] This was the discovery of blood\ngroups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or\nMedicine in 1930. In his paper, he called the specific blood group\ninteractions as isoagglutination, and also introduced the concept of\nagglutinins (antibodies), which is the actual basis of [antigen-antibody\nreaction](/wiki/Antigen-antibody_interaction \"Antigen-antibody interaction\")\nin ABO system.[8] He asserted:\n\n> [It] may be said that there exist at least two different types of\n> agglutinins, one in A, another one in B, and both together\n>\n> in C. The red blood cells are inert to the agglutinins which are present in\n> the same serum.[7]\n\nThus, he discovered two antigens (agglutinogens A and B) and two antibodies\n(agglutinins - anti-A and anti-B). His third group (C) indicated absence of\nboth A and B antigens, but contains anti-A and anti-B.[8] The following year,\nhis students Adriano Sturli and Alfred von Decastello discovered the fourth\ntype (but not naming it, and simply referred to it as \"no particular\ntype”).[9][10]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/UkrArmyBloodGroupIII%2B2000s.jpg/220px-\nUkrArmyBloodGroupIII%2B2000s.jpg)](/wiki/File:UkrArmyBloodGroupIII%2B2000s.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:UkrArmyBloodGroupIII%2B2000s.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine \"Ukraine\") marine uniform imprint, showing the\nwearer's blood type as \"B (III) Rh+\".\n\nIn 1910, [Ludwik Hirszfeld](/wiki/Ludwik_Hirszfeld \"Ludwik Hirszfeld\") and\n[Emil Freiherr von Dungern](/wiki/Emil_Freiherr_von_Dungern \"Emil Freiherr von\nDungern\") introduced the term 0 (null) for the group Landsteiner designated as\nC, and AB for the type discovered by Sturli and von Decastello. They were also\nthe first to explain the genetic inheritance of the blood groups.[11])\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Jan_Jansk%C3%BD%2C_1902.jpg/170px-\nJan_Jansk%C3%BD%2C_1902.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jan_Jansk%C3%BD,_1902.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jan_Jansk%C3%BD,_1902.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJan Janský, who invented type I, II, III, IV system.\n\nCzech serologist [Jan Janský](/wiki/Jan_Jansk%C3%BD \"Jan Janský\")\nindependently introduced blood type classification in 1907 in a local\njournal.[12] He used the Roman numerical I, II, III, and IV (corresponding to\nmodern O, A, B, and AB). Unbeknown to Janský, an American physician William L.\nMoss devised a slightly different classification using the same numerical;[13]\nhis I, II, III, and IV corresponding to modern AB, A, B, and O.[10] These two\nsystems created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. Moss's\nsystem was adopted in Britain, France, and US, while Janský's was preferred in\nmost European countries and some parts of US. To resolve the chaos, the\n[American Association of\nImmunologists](/wiki/American_Association_of_Immunologists \"American\nAssociation of Immunologists\"), the [Society of American\nBacteriologists](/wiki/American_Society_for_Microbiology \"American Society for\nMicrobiology\"), and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a\njoint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based\non priority.[14] But it was not followed particularly where Moss's system had\nbeen used. In 1927, Landsteiner, who had moved to the [Rockefeller Institute\nfor Medical Research](/wiki/Rockefeller_University \"Rockefeller University\")\nin New York, and as a member of a committee of the [National Research\nCouncil](/wiki/National_Research_Council_\\(United_States\\) \"National Research\nCouncil \\(United States\\)\") concerned with blood grouping suggested to\nsubstitute Janský's and Moss's systems with the letters 0, A, B, and AB.\n(There was another confusion on the use of figure 0 for German _null_ as\nintroduced by Hirszfeld and von Dungern, because others used the letter O for\n_ohne_ , meaning without or zero; Landsteiner chose the latter.[15]) This\nclassification was adopted by the National Research Council and became\nvariously known as the National Research Council classification, the\nInternational classification, and most popularly the \"new\" Landsteiner\nclassification. The new system was gradually accepted and by the early 1950s,\nit was universally followed.[16]\n\nThe first practical use of blood typing in transfusion was by an American\nphysician [Reuben Ottenberg](/wiki/Reuben_Ottenberg \"Reuben Ottenberg\") in\n1907. And the large-scale application started during the First World War\n(1914-1915) when [citric acid](/wiki/Citric_acid \"Citric acid\") was developed\nas [blood clot prevention](/wiki/Anticoagulant \"Anticoagulant\").[8] [Felix\nBernstein](/wiki/Felix_Bernstein_\\(mathematician\\) \"Felix Bernstein\n\\(mathematician\\)\") demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern\nof multiple [alleles](/wiki/Allele \"Allele\") at one locus in 1924.[17] Watkins\nand Morgan, in England, discovered that the ABO [epitopes](/wiki/Epitope\n\"Epitope\") were conferred by sugars, to be specific, N-acetylgalactosamine for\nthe A-type and galactose for the B-type.[18][19][20] After much published\nliterature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to\nglycosphingolipids, Finne _et al_. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte\nglycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains[21] that contains ABH substances\nattached and represent the majority of the antigens.[22][23][24] The main\nglycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and\nBand 4.5 proteins and glycophorin.[25] Later, Yamamoto's group showed the\nprecise glycosyl transferase set that confers the A, B and O epitopes.[26]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/ABO_blood_group_diagram.svg/310px-\nABO_blood_group_diagram.svg.png)](/wiki/File:ABO_blood_group_diagram.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ABO_blood_group_diagram.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDiagram showing the carbohydrate chains that determine the ABO blood group\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Type_A_blood.png)](/wiki/File:Type_A_blood.png)\n\nStudent blood test.

Red circles\nshow where there are differences in chemical structure in the antigen-binding\nsite (sometimes called the antibody-combining site) of human immunoglobulin.\nNotice the O-type antigen does not have a binding site.[27]\n\n## Alteration of ABO antigens for\ntransfusion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Alteration of ABO antigens for transfusion\")]\n\nIn April 2007, an international team of researchers announced in the journal\n_[Nature Biotechnology](/wiki/Nature_Biotechnology \"Nature Biotechnology\")_ an\ninexpensive and efficient way to convert types A, B, and AB blood into type\nO.[28] This is done by using [glycosidase](/wiki/Glycoside_hydrolase\n\"Glycoside hydrolase\") enzymes from specific bacteria to strip the blood group\nantigens from [red blood cells](/wiki/Red_blood_cell \"Red blood cell\"). The\nremoval of A and B antigens still does not address the problem of the\n[Rh](/wiki/Rh_blood_group_system \"Rh blood group system\") blood group antigen\non the blood cells of Rh positive individuals, and so blood from Rh negative\ndonors must be used. Patient trials will be conducted before the method can be\nrelied on in live situations.\n\nAnother approach to the blood antigen problem is the manufacture of\n[artificial blood](/wiki/Artificial_blood \"Artificial blood\"), which could act\nas a substitute in emergencies.[29]\n\n##\nGenetics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Genetics\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/ABO_system_codominance.svg/280px-\nABO_system_codominance.svg.png)](/wiki/File:ABO_system_codominance.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ABO_system_codominance.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA and B are [codominant](/wiki/Dominance_relationship#Co-dominance \"Dominance\nrelationship\"), giving the AB [phenotype](/wiki/Phenotype \"Phenotype\").\n\nBlood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled\nby a single [gene](/wiki/Gene \"Gene\") (the [ABO gene](/wiki/ABO_\\(gene\\) \"ABO\n\\(gene\\)\")) with three types of [alleles](/wiki/Allele \"Allele\") inferred from\n[classical genetics](/wiki/Classical_genetics \"Classical genetics\"): _i_ , _I\nA_, and _I B_. The _I_ designation stands for **isoagglutinogen** , another\nterm for [antigen](/wiki/Antigen \"Antigen\").[30] The gene encodes a\n[glycosyltransferase](/wiki/Glycosyltransferase \"Glycosyltransferase\")—that\nis, an [enzyme](/wiki/Enzyme \"Enzyme\") that modifies the\n[carbohydrate](/wiki/Carbohydrate \"Carbohydrate\") content of the [red blood\ncell](/wiki/Red_blood_cell \"Red blood cell\") antigens. The gene is located on\nthe long arm of the [ninth chromosome](/wiki/Chromosome_9_\\(human\\)\n\"Chromosome 9 \\(human\\)\") (9q34).\n\nThe _I A_ allele gives type A, _I B_ gives type B, and _i_ gives type O. As\nboth _I A_ and _I B_ are dominant over _i_ , only _ii_ people have type O\nblood. Individuals with _I AIA_ or _I Ai_ have type A blood, and individuals\nwith _I BIB_ or _I Bi_ have type B. _I AIB_ people have both\n[phenotypes](/wiki/Phenotype \"Phenotype\"), because A and B express a special\ndominance relationship: [codominance](/wiki/Dominance_relationship#Co-\ndominance \"Dominance relationship\"), which means that type A and B parents can\nhave an AB child. A couple with type A and type B can also have a type O child\nif they are both heterozygous (_I Bi_,_I Ai_) The _[cis-AB](/wiki/Cis_AB \"Cis\nAB\")_ phenotype has a single enzyme that creates both A and B antigens. The\nresulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same\nlevel that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which\ncan help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood\ngroup.[31]\n\n**Blood group inheritance**  \n---  \nBlood type  |  | **O** | **A** | **B** | **AB**  \n| Genotype  | **_ii_ (OO)** | **_I Ai_ (AO)** | **_I AIA_ (AA)** | **_I Bi_ (BO)** | **_I BIB_ (BB)** | **_I AIB_ (AB)**  \n**O** | **_ii_ (OO)** | O  \nOO OO OO OO | O or A  \nAO OO AO OO | A  \nAO AO AO AO | O or B  \nBO OO BO OO | B  \nBO BO BO BO | A or B  \nAO BO AO BO  \n**A** | **_I Ai_ (AO)** | O or A  \nAO AO OO OO | O or A  \nAA AO AO OO | A  \nAA AA AO AO | O, A, B or AB  \nAB AO BO OO | B or AB  \nAB AB BO BO | A, B or AB  \nAA AB AO BO  \n**_I AIA_ (AA)** | A  \nAO AO AO AO | A  \nAA AO AA AO | A  \nAA AA AA AA | A or AB  \nAB AO AB AO | AB  \nAB AB AB AB | A or AB  \nAA AB AA AB  \n**B** | **_I Bi_ (BO)** | O or B  \nBO BO OO OO | O, A, B or AB  \nAB BO AO OO | A or AB  \nAB AB AO AO | O or B  \nBB BO BO OO | B  \nBB BB BO BO | A, B or AB  \nAB BB AO BO  \n**_I BIB_ (BB)** | B  \nBO BO BO BO | B or AB  \nAB BO AB BO | AB  \nAB AB AB AB | B  \nBB BO BB BO | B  \nBB BB BB BB | B or AB  \nAB BB AB BB  \n**AB** | **_I AIB_ (AB)** | A or B  \nAO AO BO BO | A, B or AB  \nAA AO AB BO | A or AB  \nAA AA AB AB | A, B or AB  \nAB AO BB BO | B or AB  \nAB AB BB BB | A, B, or AB  \nAA AB AB BB  \n  \nThe table above summarizes the various blood groups that children may inherit\nfrom their parents.[32][33] Genotypes are shown in the second column and in\nsmall print for the offspring: AO and AA both test as type A; BO and BB test\nas type B. The four possibilities represent the combinations obtained when one\nallele is taken from each parent; each has a 25% chance, but some occur more\nthan once.\n\n**Blood group inheritance by phenotype only**  \n---  \nBlood type  | **O** | **A** | **B** | **AB**  \n**O** | O  | O or A  | O or B  | A or B   \n**A** | O or A  | O or A  | O, A, B or AB  | A, B or AB   \n**B** | O or B  | O, A, B or AB  | O or B  | A, B or AB   \n**AB** | A or B  | A, B or AB  | A, B or AB  | A, B or AB   \n  \nHistorically, ABO blood tests were used in [paternity\ntesting](/wiki/DNA_paternity_testing \"DNA paternity testing\"), but in 1957\nonly 50% of American men falsely accused were able to use them as evidence\nagainst paternity.[34] Occasionally, the blood types of children are not\nconsistent with expectations—for example, a type O child can be born to an AB\nparent—due to rare situations, such as [Bombay\nphenotype](/wiki/Bombay_phenotype \"Bombay phenotype\") and [cis\nAB](/wiki/Cis_AB \"Cis AB\").[35]\n\n###\nSubgroups[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Subgroups\")]\n\nThe A blood type contains about 20 subgroups, of which A1 and A2 are the most\ncommon (over 99%). A1 makes up about 80% of all A-type blood, with A2 making\nup almost all of the rest.[36] These two subgroups are not always\ninterchangeable as far as transfusion is concerned, as some A2 individuals\nproduce antibodies against the A1 antigen. Complications can sometimes arise\nin rare cases when typing the blood.[36]\n\nWith the development of [DNA sequencing](/wiki/DNA_sequencing \"DNA\nsequencing\"), it has been possible to identify a much larger number of alleles\nat the ABO locus, each of which can be categorized as A, B, or O in terms of\nthe reaction to transfusion, but which can be distinguished by variations in\nthe [DNA](/wiki/DNA \"DNA\") sequence. There are six common\n[alleles](/wiki/Allele \"Allele\") in white individuals of the [ABO\ngene](/wiki/ABO_gene \"ABO gene\") that produce one's blood type:[37][38]\n\nA | B | O   \n---|---|---  \n_A101_ (A1)  \n_A201_ (A2)  | _B101_ (B1)  | _O01_ (O1)  \n_O02_ (O1v)  \n_O03_ (O2)  \n  \nThe same study also identified 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker\nglycosylation activity. People with weak alleles of A can sometimes express\nanti-A antibodies, though these are usually not clinically significant as they\ndo not stably interact with the antigen at body temperature.[39]\n\n[Cis AB](/wiki/Cis_AB \"Cis AB\") is another rare variant, in which A and B\ngenes are transmitted together from a single parent.\n\n### Distribution and evolutionary\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Distribution and evolutionary history\")]\n\nMain article: [Blood type distribution by\ncountry](/wiki/Blood_type_distribution_by_country \"Blood type distribution by\ncountry\")\n\nThe distribution of the blood groups A, B, O and AB varies across the world\naccording to the population. There are also variations in blood type\ndistribution within human subpopulations.\n\nIn the UK, the distribution of blood type frequencies through the population\nstill shows some correlation to the distribution of\n[placenames](/wiki/Toponymy \"Toponymy\") and to the successive invasions and\nmigrations including [Norsemen](/wiki/Norsemen \"Norsemen\"),\n[Danes](/wiki/Danes_\\(Germanic_tribe\\) \"Danes \\(Germanic tribe\\)\"),\n[Saxons](/wiki/Saxons \"Saxons\"), [Celts](/wiki/Celts \"Celts\"), and\n[Normans](/wiki/Normans \"Normans\") who contributed the\n[morphemes](/wiki/Morpheme \"Morpheme\") to the placenames and the\n[genes](/wiki/Gene \"Gene\") to the population.[40]\n\nThe two common O alleles, O01 and O02, share their first 261\n[nucleotides](/wiki/Nucleotide \"Nucleotide\") with the group A allele A01.[41]\nHowever, unlike the group A allele, a [guanosine](/wiki/Guanosine \"Guanosine\")\nbase is subsequently deleted. A premature [stop codon](/wiki/Stop_codon \"Stop\ncodon\") results from this [frame-shift mutation](/wiki/Frame-shift_mutation\n\"Frame-shift mutation\"). This variant is found worldwide, and likely predates\nhuman migration from [Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\"). The O01 allele is\nconsidered to predate the O02 allele.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nSome evolutionary biologists theorize that there are four main lineages of the\nABO gene and that mutations creating type O have occurred at least three times\nin humans.[42] From oldest to youngest, these lineages comprise the following\nalleles: _A101/A201/O09_ , _B101_ , _O02_ and _O01_. The continued presence of\nthe O alleles is hypothesized to be the result of [balancing\nselection](/wiki/Balancing_selection \"Balancing selection\").[42] Both theories\ncontradict the previously held theory that type O blood evolved\nfirst.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n### Origin\ntheories[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Origin theories\")]\n\nIt is possible that food and environmental antigens (bacterial, viral, or\nplant antigens) have [epitopes](/wiki/Epitope \"Epitope\") similar enough to A\nand B glycoprotein antigens. The antibodies created against these\nenvironmental antigens in the first years of life can cross-react with ABO-\nincompatible red blood cells that it comes in contact with during blood\ntransfusion later in life. Anti-A antibodies are hypothesized to originate\nfrom immune response towards [influenza virus](/wiki/Influenza_virus\n\"Influenza virus\"), whose epitopes are similar enough to the α-D-N-\ngalactosamine on the A glycoprotein to be able to elicit a cross-reaction.\nAnti-B antibodies are hypothesized to originate from antibodies produced\nagainst [Gram-negative bacteria](/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria \"Gram-negative\nbacteria\"), such as _[E. coli](/wiki/Escherichia_coli \"Escherichia coli\")_ ,\ncross-reacting with the α-D-galactose on the B glycoprotein.[43]\n\nHowever, it is more likely that the force driving evolution of allele\ndiversity is simply negative frequency-dependent selection; cells with rare\nvariants of membrane antigens are more easily distinguished by the immune\nsystem from pathogens carrying antigens from other hosts. Thus, individuals\npossessing rare types are better equipped to detect pathogens. The high\nwithin-population diversity observed in human populations would, then, be a\nconsequence of natural selection on individuals.[44]\n\nHIV can be neutralized in _in vitro_ experiments using antibodies against\nblood group antigens specifically expressed on the HIV-producing cell\nlines.[45][46]\n\n## Clinical\nrelevance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Clinical relevance\")]\n\nThe carbohydrate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells have roles in\n[cell membrane](/wiki/Cell_membrane \"Cell membrane\") integrity, [cell\nadhesion](/wiki/Cell_adhesion \"Cell adhesion\"), membrane transportation of\nmolecules, and acting as receptors for extracellular ligands, and enzymes.

In fact,\nhaving type O blood predisposes to bleeding,[50] as 30% of the total genetic\nvariation observed in plasma vWF is explained by the effect of the ABO blood\ngroup,[51] and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly\nlower plasma levels of vWF (and [Factor VIII](/wiki/Factor_VIII \"Factor\nVIII\")) than do non-O individuals.[52][53] In addition, vWF is degraded more\nrapidly due to the higher prevalence of blood group O with the Cys1584 variant\nof vWF (an amino acid [polymorphism](/wiki/Polymorphism_\\(biology\\)\n\"Polymorphism \\(biology\\)\") in VWF):[54] the gene for\n[ADAMTS13](/wiki/ADAMTS13 \"ADAMTS13\") (vWF-cleaving [protease](/wiki/Protease\n\"Protease\")) maps to the [ninth chromosome](/wiki/Chromosome_9_\\(human\\)\n\"Chromosome 9 \\(human\\)\") (9q34), the same [locus](/wiki/Locus_\\(genetics\\)\n\"Locus \\(genetics\\)\") as ABO blood type. Higher levels of vWF are more common\namongst people who have had [ischemic stroke](/wiki/Ischemic_stroke \"Ischemic\nstroke\") (from blood clotting) for the first time.[55] The results of this\nstudy found that the occurrence was not affected by ADAMTS13 polymorphism, and\nthe only significant genetic factor was the person's blood group.\n\n### Disease\nrisks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Disease risks\")]\n\nCompared to O group individuals, non-O group (A, AB, and B) individuals have a\n14% reduced risk of [squamous cell carcinoma](/wiki/Squamous_cell_carcinoma\n\"Squamous cell carcinoma\") and 4% reduced risk of [basal cell\ncarcinoma](/wiki/Basal_cell_carcinoma \"Basal cell carcinoma\").[56] Conversely,\ntype O blood is associated with a reduced risk of [pancreatic\ncancer](/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer \"Pancreatic cancer\").[57][58] The B antigen\nlinks with increased risk of [ovarian cancer](/wiki/Ovarian_cancer \"Ovarian\ncancer\").[59] [Gastric cancer](/wiki/Gastric_cancer \"Gastric cancer\") has\nreported to be more common in blood group A and least in group O.[60]\n\nAccording to Glass, Holmgren, et al., those in the O blood group have an\nincreased risk of infection with [cholera](/wiki/Cholera \"Cholera\"), and those\nO-group individuals who are infected have more severe infections. The\nmechanisms behind this association with cholera are unclear in the\nliterature.[61]\n\n### ABO hemolytic disease of the\nnewborn[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn\")]\n\nMain article: [Hemolytic disease of the newborn\n(ABO)](/wiki/Hemolytic_disease_of_the_newborn_\\(ABO\\) \"Hemolytic disease of\nthe newborn \\(ABO\\)\")\n\nABO blood group incompatibilities between the mother and child does not\nusually cause [hemolytic disease of the\nnewborn](/wiki/Hemolytic_disease_of_the_newborn \"Hemolytic disease of the\nnewborn\") (HDN) because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are usually of the\n[IgM](/wiki/IgM \"IgM\") type, which do not cross the placenta.

In most human carcinomas,\nincluding oral carcinoma, a significant event as part of the underlying\nmechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens.[65] Several studies\nhave observed that a relative down-regulation of GTA and GTB occurs in oral\ncarcinomas in association with tumor development.[65][66] More recently, a\ngenome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus\nassociated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.[67]\n\n### Clinical\nmarker[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Clinical marker\")]\n\nA multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci,\nincluding the ABO gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both\nincident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced\nclinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community\ncohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized\ncontrolled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and\nsecondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).[68]\n\n##\nPseudoscience[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ABO_blood_group_system&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Pseudoscience\")]\n\nDuring the 1930s, connecting [blood groups to personality\ntypes](/wiki/Blood_types_in_Japanese_culture \"Blood types in Japanese\nculture\") became popular in Japan and other areas of the world.[69] Studies of\nthis association have yet to confirm its existence definitively.[70][71]\n\nOther popular but unsupported ideas include the use of a [blood type\ndiet](/wiki/Blood_type_diet \"Blood type diet\"), claims that group A causes\nsevere [hangovers](/wiki/Hangover \"Hangover\"), group O is associated with\nperfect teeth, and those with blood group A2 have the highest [IQs](/wiki/IQ\n\"IQ\").
