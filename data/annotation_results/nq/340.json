It\nwas found for the first time in 2011 in [Cologne](/wiki/Cologne \"Cologne\"),\nGermany.[9] It is originally from the [Canary Islands](/wiki/Canary_Islands\n\"Canary Islands\") and [Madeira](/wiki/Madeira \"Madeira\").[10] In England it\nhas been reported mostly in southern counties,[11][12] but its range appears\nto be expanding northwards.[13] In 2011, the spider was reported as an\nestablished [invasive species](/wiki/Invasive_species \"Invasive species\") in\nthe USA, in [Ventura County, California](/wiki/Ventura_County,_California\n\"Ventura County, California\").[14] In January 2016, it was reported that\n_Steatoda nobilis_ had been found in [Chile](/wiki/Chile \"Chile\"), the first\ntime that the species had been recorded in the southern hemisphere.[15][16]\n\nAs with other members of the family [Theridiidae](/wiki/Theridiidae\n\"Theridiidae\"), _Steatoda nobilis_ constructs a cobweb which is an irregular\ntangle of sticky silken fibres. Its 'scaffold web' differs from others of the\ngenus in the exceptional strength of the silk, and in the tubular retreat that\nis at least partly concealed in a deep crack or hole.[12] They have poor\neyesight and depend mostly on vibrations reaching them through their webs to\norient themselves to prey or warn them of larger animals that could injure or\nkill them.\n\n### Population expansion in UK and\nIreland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Steatoda_nobilis&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Population expansion in UK and Ireland\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Steatoda_nobilis.jpg/220px-\nSteatoda_nobilis.jpg)](/wiki/File:Steatoda_nobilis.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Steatoda_nobilis.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Steatoda nobilis_ , Hampshire, England\n\nThe distribution of _Steatoda nobilis_ is expected to increase northwards in\nthe UK, due to, at least partly, mild winters in recent years. This prediction\nwas reported by Stuart Hine of the [Natural History\nMuseum](/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London \"Natural History Museum,\nLondon\"),[17] and is substantiated by the National Recording Scheme.[12]\n\nThe spider is reported to be an established species in Ireland.[18]\n\n## Medical\nsignificance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Steatoda_nobilis&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Medical significance\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/SteatodaN.jpg/220px-\nSteatodaN.jpg)](/wiki/File:SteatodaN.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:SteatodaN.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFemale of _Steatoda nobilis_ in Hampshire\n\nLike almost all spiders, _Steatoda nobilis_ is venomous, but its bite is\nalmost exclusively of mild effect on humans, without the severe consequences\nthat can occur with [black widow spiders](/wiki/Latrodectus_mactans\n\"Latrodectus mactans\"). It is often alleged to be one of the spiders whose\nbite involves venom [medically\nsignificant](/wiki/List_of_medically_significant_spider_bites \"List of\nmedically significant spider bites\") for humans, even though the few recorded\nbites do not typically present long-lasting effects. The symptoms of a bite\nare typically similar to a bee or wasp sting.[8] The bite of this spider,\nalong with others in the genus _[Steatoda](/wiki/Steatoda \"Steatoda\")_ , can\nproduce a set of symptoms known as steatodism. Symptoms of bites include\nintense pain radiating from the bite site, along with feverishness or general\nmalaise.[19] Male bites are less severe than those of females.[16]\n\n## Media\nreaction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Steatoda_nobilis&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Media reaction\")]\n\nSensationalised stories about the bite of _Steatoda nobilis_ have featured in\nUK newspaper articles.[20][21] Stuart Hine from the [Natural History\nMuseum](/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London \"Natural History Museum,\nLondon\"), London responded on the naturenet blog, stating, \"Of course I also\nexplain the great value of spiders and how rare the event of spider bite in\nthe UK actually is. I also always explain that up to 12 people die from\nwasp/bee stings in the UK each year and we do not panic so much about wasps\nand bees â€“ but this never makes it past editing.\" [17] Steven Falk, an\n[entomologist](/wiki/Entomology \"Entomology\"), cautioned that without \"hard\nevidence\", it is difficult to know how many of the bites reported in the media\nhave been caused by false widow spiders.[22] The arrival of _Steatoda nobilis_\nin Chile in 2016 led to a similar media reaction.[23]\n\n### Alleged\nincidents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Steatoda_nobilis&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Alleged incidents\")]\n\n  * In 2006 a [Dorchester](/wiki/Dorchester,_Dorset \"Dorchester, Dorset\") man spent three days in [Dorset County Hospital](/wiki/Dorset_County_Hospital \"Dorset County Hospital\") with symptoms of heart seizure, after suffering a spider bite believed to be caused by _Steatoda nobilis_.[5]\n  * In 2013 a man in [Sidcup](/wiki/Sidcup \"Sidcup\"), [Kent](/wiki/Kent \"Kent\") was allegedly bitten in his sleep, reporting that his hand had turned black and yellow. His hand remained swollen for five weeks until doctors gave him a course of antibiotics.[24]\n  * In October 2013, it was reported that a man from [Romford](/wiki/Romford \"Romford\") in [Essex](/wiki/Essex \"Essex\") had been allegedly bitten by a false widow. He was treated for bacterial infection with [antibiotics](/wiki/Antibacterial \"Antibacterial\") and needed to have his leg drained of [pus](/wiki/Pus \"Pus\").[25]\n  * In October 2013, a British school in the [Forest of Dean](/wiki/Forest_of_Dean \"Forest of Dean\") was closed for a day for [fumigation](/wiki/Fumigation \"Fumigation\") as a result of a dense population of _Steatoda nobilis_ on the site.[26]\n  * In 2014, a woman from [County Durham](/wiki/County_Durham \"County Durham\") had her left index finger amputated after contracting the flesh-eating bug [necrotising fasciitis](/wiki/Necrotising_fasciitis \"Necrotising fasciitis\") following a claimed bite from a false widow spider.[27][28]\n  * In October 2014, an Irish man went into [cardiac arrest](/wiki/Cardiac_arrest \"Cardiac arrest\") and spent a day in intensive care after being bitten three times by what was claimed as a false widow, on the hip, side and shoulder.[29]\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Steatoda_nobilis&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n**a.** **^** The correct and full English name for _Steatoda nobilis_ is\n\"Noble false widow\".
