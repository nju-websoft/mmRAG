Compatible but different\nimplementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the [European\nUnion](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\") and the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), respectively.[6]\n\nThe VIN comprises the following sections:\n\nStandard | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nISO 3779 | World manufacturer identifier | VDS | VIS  \n[European Union](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\")[7] more than 500 vehicles/year | World manufacturer identifier | Indication of \"_the general characteristics of the vehicle_ \" | Indication that provides \"_clear identification of a particular vehicle_ \"  \n[European Union](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\")[7] 500 or fewer vehicles/year | World manufacturer identifier | 9 | Indication of \"_the general characteristics of the vehicle_ \" | Indication that provides \"_clear identification of a particular vehicle_ \"  \n[North America](/wiki/North_America \"North America\") more than 2000 vehicles/year | World manufacturer identifier | Vehicle attributes | Check digit | Model year | Plant code | Sequential number  \nNorth America 2000 or fewer vehicles/year | World manufacturer identifier | 9 | Vehicle attributes | Check digit | Model year | Plant code | Manufacturer identifier | Sequential number  \n  \n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/VIN_-\n_Fahrgestellnummer_IMG_0470.JPG/220px-VIN_-\n_Fahrgestellnummer_IMG_0470.JPG)](/wiki/File:VIN_-\n_Fahrgestellnummer_IMG_0470.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:VIN_-_Fahrgestellnummer_IMG_0470.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nVIN in a GM-T-Platform body next to a passenger seat\n\n### World manufacturer\nidentifier[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: World manufacturer identifier\")]\n\nThe first three characters uniquely identify the\n[manufacturer](/wiki/Manufacturer \"Manufacturer\") of the vehicle using the\nworld manufacturer identifier or WMI code. A manufacturer who builds fewer\nthan 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th\nand 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some\nmanufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g.,\nbus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within\n1G (assigned to [General Motors](/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation \"General\nMotors Corporation\") in the United States), 1G1 represents\n[Chevrolet](/wiki/Chevrolet \"Chevrolet\") passenger cars; 1G2,\n[Pontiac](/wiki/Pontiac \"Pontiac\") passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet\n[trucks](/wiki/Truck \"Truck\").\n\nThe [Society of Automotive Engineers](/wiki/Society_of_Automotive_Engineers\n\"Society of Automotive Engineers\") (SAE) in the U.S. assigns WMIs to countries\nand manufacturers.[8]\n\nThe first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is\nlocated. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although\nin Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign\nthe WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars\nwhether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI\nof _W0L_ because Adam Opel AG is based in Rüsselsheim, Germany).\n\nIn the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is\nthe last number. For example, 8X–82 denotes the range 8X, 8Y, 8Z, 81, 82,\nexcluding 80.

This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle\ntype, and may include information on the [automobile\nplatform](/wiki/Automobile_platform \"Automobile platform\") used, the model,\nand the [body style](/wiki/Car_body_styles \"Car body styles\"). Each\nmanufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers\nsince the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type\nwhenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for\nthe 2007 [Chevrolet Corvette](/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette \"Chevrolet Corvette\"),\nU is for a 6.0-liter [V8](/wiki/V8_engine \"V8 engine\") engine, and E is for a\n7.0 L V8.\n\n#### North American check\ndigits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: North American check digits\")]\n\nOne element that is fairly consistent is the use of position nine as a check\ndigit, compulsory for vehicles in North America, and used fairly consistently\nelsewhere.\n\n### Vehicle identifier\nsection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Vehicle identifier section\")]\n\nThe 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS).\nThis is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in\nquestion. This may include information on options installed or engine and\ntransmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In North\nAmerica, the last five digits must be numeric.\n\n#### Model year\nencoding[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Model year encoding\")]\n\nOne consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit, which is required\nworldwide to encode the model year of the vehicle. Besides the three letters\nthat are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and\nthe digit 0 are not used for the [model year](/wiki/Model_year \"Model year\")\ncode. The year code is the model year for the vehicle.\n\nThe year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially [General\nMotors](/wiki/General_Motors \"General Motors\") and [Chrysler](/wiki/Chrysler\n\"Chrysler\"), as \"A\" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and\nthe \"A\" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet\n[Ford](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford Motor Company\") and\n[AMC](/wiki/American_Motors_Corporation \"American Motors Corporation\") still\nused a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters,\nso that \"Y\" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1\nto 9, and subsequent years are encoded as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc.\n\nCode | Year |  | Code | Year |  | Code | Year |  | Code | Year |  | Code | Year |  | Code | Year  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nA = | 1980 |  | L = | 1990 |  | Y = | 2000 |  | A = | 2010 |  | L = | 2020 |  | Y = | 2030  \nB = | 1981 |  | M = | 1991 |  | 1 = | 2001 |  | B = | 2011 |  | M = | 2021 |  | 1 = | 2031  \nC = | 1982 |  | N = | 1992 |  | 2 = | 2002 |  | C = | 2012 |  | N = | 2022 |  | 2 = | 2032  \nD = | 1983 |  | P = | 1993 |  | 3 = | 2003 |  | D = | 2013 |  | P = | 2023 |  | 3 = | 2033  \nE = | 1984 |  | R = | 1994 |  | 4 = | 2004 |  | E = | 2014 |  | R = | 2024 |  | 4 = | 2034  \nF = | 1985 |  | S = | 1995 |  | 5 = | 2005 |  | F = | 2015 |  | S = | 2025 |  | 5 = | 2035  \nG = | 1986 |  | T = | 1996 |  | 6 = | 2006 |  | G = | 2016 |  | T = | 2026 |  | 6 = | 2036  \nH = | 1987 |  | V = | 1997 |  | 7 = | 2007 |  | H = | 2017 |  | V = | 2027 |  | 7 = | 2037  \nJ = | 1988 |  | W = | 1998 |  | 8 = | 2008 |  | J = | 2018 |  | W = | 2028 |  | 8 = | 2038  \nK = | 1989 |  | X = | 1999 |  | 9 = | 2009 |  | K = | 2019 |  | X = | 2029 |  | 9 = | 2039  \n  \nOn April 30, 2008, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nadopted a final rule amending 49 CFR Part 565, \"so that the current 17\ncharacter vehicle identification number (VIN) system, which has been in place\nfor almost 30 years, can continue in use for at least another 30 years\", in\nthe process making several changes to the VIN requirements applicable to all\nmotor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States. There are three\nnotable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:\n\n  * The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.\n  * In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980–2009.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010–2039.\n  * The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than 10,000 lb (4,500 kg), as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1–8 and 10 that were assigned from 1980–2009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.\n\n#### Plant\ncode[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Plant code\")]\n\nCompulsory in North America is the use of the 11th character to identify the\nfactory at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of\nplant codes.\n\n#### Production\nnumber[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Production number\")]\n\nIn the United States, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or\nproduction number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses\nits own sequence.\n\n## Check-digit\ncalculation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Check-digit calculation\")]\n\nCheck-digit validation is compulsory for all road vehicles sold in North\nAmerica.\n\nWhen trying to validate a VIN with a [check digit](/wiki/Check_digit \"Check\ndigit\"), first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of\ncalculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see below) to cancel it out. The\noriginal value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value.\nIf the calculated value is 0–9, the check digit must match the calculated\nvalue. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two\nvalues do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is\na mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct,\nbecause there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a\nmatching check digit: for example, the valid VINs `5GZCZ43D13S812715` (correct\nwith leading five) and `SGZCZ43D13S812715` (incorrect with leading character\n\"S\"). The VINs in the Porsche image, `WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124`, and the GM-T body\nimage, `KLATF08Y1VB363636`, do not pass the North American check-digit\nverification.\n\n### Transliterating the\nnumbers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Transliterating the numbers\")]\n\nTransliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and substituting them\nwith their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives\n(based on IBM's [EBCDIC](/wiki/EBCDIC \"EBCDIC\")) are in the following chart.\n_I_ , _O_ , and _Q_ are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have\nbeen filled in with _N/A_ (_not applicable_). Numerical digits use their own\nvalues.\n\nTransliteration key: values for VIN decoding **A** : 1 | **B** : 2 | **C** : 3 | **D** : 4 | **E** : 5 | **F** : 6 | **G** : 7 | **H** : 8 | N/A  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**J** : 1 | **K** : 2 | **L** : 3 | **M** : 4 | **N** : 5 | N/A | **P** : 7 | N/A | **R** : 9  \n| **S** : 2 | **T** : 3 | **U** : 4 | **V** : 5 | **W** : 6 | **X** : 7 | **Y** : 8 | **Z** : 9  \n  \n_S_ is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.\n\n### Weights used in\ncalculation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Weights used in calculation\")]\n\nThe following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th\nposition is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which\nwill cancel it out in the multiplication step.\n\nWeight factor table Position | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nWeight | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 10 | 0 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2  \n  \n### Worked\nexample[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Worked example\")]\n\nConsider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be\nthe check digit.\n\nVIN | 1 | M | 8 | G | D | M | 9 | A |  | K | P | 0 | 4 | 2 | 7 | 8 | 8  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nValue | 1 | 4 | 8 | 7 | 4 | 4 | 9 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 4 | 2 | 7 | 8 | 8  \nWeight | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 10 | 0 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2  \nProducts | 8  | 28 | 48 | 35 | 16 | 12 | 18 | 10 | 0  | 18 | 56 | 0  | 24 | 10 | 28 | 24 | 16  \n  \n  1.

In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as _X_.\n\nWith a check digit of _X_ , the VIN `1M8GDM9A_KP042788` is written `1M8GDM9A\n_X_ KP042788`.\n\nA VIN with _straight-ones_ (seventeen consecutive _1_ s) has the nice feature\nthat its check digit _1_ matches the calculated value _1_. This is because a\nvalue of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is\n8 with remainder  1⁄11; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a\nVIN-check algorithm.\n\n### Example\ncode[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Example code\")]\n\nJava\n\n    \n    \n    private static int transliterate(char c) {\n    \treturn \"0123456789.ABCDEFGH..JKLMN.P.R..STUVWXYZ\".indexOf(c) % 10;\n    }\n    \n    private static char getCheckDigit(String vin) {\n    \tString map = \"0123456789X\";\n    \tString weights = \"8765432X098765432\";\n    \tint sum = 0;\n    \tfor (int i = 0; i < 17; ++i) {\n    \t\tsum += transliterate(vin.charAt(i)) * map.indexOf(weights.charAt(i));\n    \t}\n    \treturn map.charAt(sum % 11);\n    }\n    \n    private static boolean validate(String vin) {\n        if(vin.length()!=17) return false;\n    \treturn getCheckDigit(vin) == vin.charAt(8);\n    }\n    \n\n  \n\n## VIN\nscanning[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vehicle_identification_number&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: VIN scanning\")]\n\nVINs may be optically read with barcode scanners or digital cameras, or\ndigitally read via [OBD-II](/wiki/OBD-II \"OBD-II\") in newer vehicles.
