She is based on [the Evil Queen](/wiki/Queen_\\(Snow_White\\)\n\"Queen \\(Snow White\\)\") character from the European [fairy\ntale](/wiki/Fairy_tale \"Fairy tale\") \"[Snow White](/wiki/Snow_White \"Snow\nWhite\")\".\n\nIn the film, similar to the [Brothers Grimm](/wiki/Brothers_Grimm \"Brothers\nGrimm\") story, the Evil Queen is cold, cruel, and extremely vain, and\nobsessively desires to remain the \"fairest in the land\". She becomes madly\nenvious over the beauty of her stepdaughter, Princess [Snow\nWhite](/wiki/Snow_White_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Snow White \\(Disney\ncharacter\\)\"), as well as the attentions of the Prince from another land; such\n[love triangle](/wiki/Love_triangle \"Love triangle\") element is one of\nDisney's changes to the story. This leads her to plot the death of Snow White\nand ultimately on the path to her own demise, which in the film is indirectly\ncaused by the [Seven Dwarfs](/wiki/Seven_Dwarfs \"Seven Dwarfs\"). The film's\nversion of the Queen character uses her dark magic powers to actually\ntransform herself into an old woman instead of just taking a disguise like in\nthe Grimms' story; this appearance of hers is commonly referred to as the\n**Wicked Witch** or alternatively as the **Old Hag** or just the **Witch**.\nThe Queen dies in the film, but lives on in a variety of non-canonical Disney\nworks.\n\nThe film's version of the Queen was created by [Walt Disney](/wiki/Walt_Disney\n\"Walt Disney\") and [Joe Grant](/wiki/Joe_Grant \"Joe Grant\"), and originally\nanimated by [Art Babbit](/wiki/Art_Babbit \"Art Babbit\") and voiced by [Lucille\nLa Verne](/wiki/Lucille_La_Verne \"Lucille La Verne\"). Inspiration for her\ndesign came from the characters of Queen Hash-a-Motep from\n_[She](/wiki/She_\\(1935_film\\) \"She \\(1935 film\\)\")_ and Princess\n[Kriemhild](/wiki/Kriemhild \"Kriemhild\") from _[Die\nNibelungen](/wiki/Die_Nibelungen \"Die Nibelungen\")_. The Queen has since been\nvoiced by [Eleanor Audley](/wiki/Eleanor_Audley \"Eleanor Audley\"), [June\nForay](/wiki/June_Foray \"June Foray\"), [Janet Waldo](/wiki/Janet_Waldo \"Janet\nWaldo\"), Eda Reiss Merin, [Louise Chamis](/wiki/Louise_Chamis \"Louise Chamis\")\nand [Susanne Blakeslee](/wiki/Susanne_Blakeslee \"Susanne Blakeslee\"), and was\nportrayed live by [Anne Francine](/wiki/Anne_Francine \"Anne Francine\")\n(musical), [Jane Curtin](/wiki/Jane_Curtin \"Jane Curtin\") (50th anniversary TV\nspecial), and [Olivia Wilde](/wiki/Olivia_Wilde \"Olivia Wilde\") (_Disney Dream\nPortraits_), [Kathy Najimy](/wiki/Kathy_Najimy \"Kathy Najimy\")\n(_[Descendants](/wiki/Descendants_\\(2015_film\\) \"Descendants \\(2015\nfilm\\)\")_), and in an alternative version, by [Lana\nParrilla](/wiki/Lana_Parrilla \"Lana Parrilla\") (_[Once Upon a\nTime](/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_\\(TV_series\\) \"Once Upon a Time \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_).\n\nThis version of the classic fairy tale character has been very well received\nby film critics and the public, and is considered one of Disney's most iconic\nand menacing villains. Besides in the film, the Evil Queen has made numerous\nappearances in Disney attractions and productions, including not only these\ndirectly related to the tale of Snow White, such as\n_[Fantasmic!](/wiki/Fantasmic! \"Fantasmic!\")_ , _[The Kingdom\nKeepers](/wiki/The_Kingdom_Keepers \"The Kingdom Keepers\")_ and _[Kingdom\nHearts Birth by Sleep](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_Birth_by_Sleep \"Kingdom Hearts\nBirth by Sleep\")_ , sometimes appearing in them alongside\n[Maleficent](/wiki/Maleficent \"Maleficent\") from _[Sleeping\nBeauty](/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_\\(1959_film\\) \"Sleeping Beauty \\(1959 film\\)\")_.\nThe film's version of the Queen has also become a popular\n[archetype](/wiki/Archetype \"Archetype\") that influenced a number of artists\nand non-Disney works.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 In _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_\n    * 1.1 Storyline\n    * 1.2 Conception, design and portrayal\n    * 1.3 Abandoned concepts\n  * 2 Other appearances\n    * 2.1 Attractions\n    * 2.2 Film and television\n    * 2.3 Books\n    * 2.4 Theatrical shows\n    * 2.5 Games\n    * 2.6 Comics\n    * 2.7 Merchandise\n  * 3 In _Once Upon a Time_\n  * 4 Reception\n    * 4.1 Critical reception and popularity\n    * 4.2 Cultural impact\n    * 4.3 Homage cameos and parodies\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n\n## In _Snow White and the Seven\nDwarfs_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evil_Queen_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: In Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\")]\n\nMain article: [Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937\nfilm)](/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_\\(1937_film\\) \"Snow White and the\nSeven Dwarfs \\(1937 film\\)\")\n\n###\nStoryline[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evil_Queen_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Storyline\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Evil_Queen_Grimhilde.png/170px-\nEvil_Queen_Grimhilde.png)](/wiki/File:Evil_Queen_Grimhilde.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Evil_Queen_Grimhilde.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Queen in her secret lair in an illustration by the [Brothers\nHildebrandt](/wiki/Brothers_Hildebrandt \"Brothers Hildebrandt\")\n\nIn \"another land, far away,\"[4] \"many, many years ago,\" about the time of\n[fairy tales](/wiki/Fairy_tale \"Fairy tale\") of castles, knights, fair\nmaidens, romance, magic and witches,\"[5] a mysterious and icily beautiful\nwoman with magical powers (a 1938 promotional brochure suggests she is able to\nwork her [witchcraft](/wiki/Witchcraft \"Witchcraft\") having sold \"herself body\nand soul to the bad spirits\" of the [Harz](/wiki/Harz \"Harz\") mountains[6])\nhas gained her royal position by seducing and marrying the widowed\n[King](/wiki/King_\\(Snow_White\\) \"King \\(Snow White\\)\"), giving her rule over\nhis kingdom before he died. \"From that time on the cruel Queen ruled all\nalone, her every word was law, and all trembled in mortal fear of her\nanger.\"[7] The vain Queen owned a magical mirror with which she could look\nupon whatever she wished. The [Magic Mirror](/wiki/Magic_Mirror_\\(Snow_White\\)\n\"Magic Mirror \\(Snow White\\)\") shows a haunted, smokey face of her [familiar\ndemon](/wiki/Familiar_spirit \"Familiar spirit\")[6] which replies to the\nQueen's requests. She regularly asks the mirror who is the fairest in the\nrealm (\"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" which is\noften misquoted as \"Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them\nall\"[8][9]), and the mirror would always reply that she is.\n\nOne day, however, the mirror tells her that there is a new fairest woman in\nthe land, her 14-year-old[10] stepdaughter, Princess [Snow\nWhite](/wiki/Snow_White_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Snow White \\(Disney\ncharacter\\)\"). She became obsessively jealous of the princess' emerging\nbeauty, therefore turning her into a [scullery maid](/wiki/Scullery_maid\n\"Scullery maid\") in her own home. After observing the handsome Prince from\nanother kingdom singing a love song to Snow White, the proud Queen, in a\njealous rage, commands her faithful [Huntsman](/wiki/Huntsman_\\(Snow_White\\)\n\"Huntsman \\(Snow White\\)\"), Humbert, to take the princess deep into the forest\nand kill her. He is ordered to bring back her heart in a box to prove that he\nhad done so. But Humbert cannot bear to kill the young princess upon realizing\nthat she is impervious to harm, so he tells Snow White of the Queen's plot and\ntells her to run away and never to come back. To escape the penalty, he comes\nback with a pig's heart and gives it to the Queen. When she questions her\nmirror, it again replies that Snow White is the fairest in the land, and that\nshe is living at the cottage of the [Seven Dwarfs](/wiki/Seven_Dwarfs \"Seven\nDwarfs\"), revealing that the box contains the heart of a pig. The Dwarfs are\nfearful of the Queen's [black magic](/wiki/Black_magic \"Black magic\") but\ndecide to take in Snow White anyway.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Snow_White_Witch.jpg/170px-\nSnow_White_Witch.jpg)](/wiki/File:Snow_White_Witch.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Snow_White_Witch.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Witch (right) offering a poisoned apple to [Snow\nWhite](/wiki/Snow_White_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Snow White \\(Disney\ncharacter\\)\") in [Gustaf Tenggren](/wiki/Gustaf_Tenggren \"Gustaf Tenggren\")'s\ninspirational art for the film\n\nFurious that Humbert tricked her, the Queen decides that first Snow White\nshall die by her own hand and at any cost. She goes down the dungeon to her\nsecret room where she practices her dark magic, complete with a pet raven that\n\"knows all her secrets,\"[11] and in desperation uses her spellbook and\ncauldron to mix a potion that transforms her into a [hag](/wiki/Hag \"Hag\").\nHer beauty is shrouded in ugliness and age, though presumably reversible.[12]\nShe then conjures a poison apple, which will cause \"the Sleeping Death\",[13]\nand proceeds to leave the castle via a moat boat. She is sure that no one\nwould know or perform the counter-curse to her spell, and believes the Dwarfs\nwould bury her rival alive, thinking her dead. The Queen comes to the cottage,\nfollowed by two vicious vultures, and finds Snow White baking a pie for Grumpy\nthe dwarf. Somehow Snow White's animal friends realize that the old hag is the\nQueen. After an unsuccessful attempt to warn Snow White by attacking the\nQueen, they go to warn the Dwarfs of the Queen's arrival. The Queen tricks the\nprincess into letting her inside the cottage and eating the bewitched apple,\ntelling her that it is a magic wishing apple. Snow White takes a bite and\nfalls to the floor, apparently dead.\n\nThe Queen rejoices in her victory, but is soon discovered by the angry Seven\nDwarfs, who grab pickaxes and chase her deep into the forest as a great storm\nbegins. She climbs up into the mountains, where she gets trapped upon a\nprecipice that overlooks a seemingly bottomless canyon. She tries to push down\na large boulder to crush the approaching Dwarfs. Before she can do so, a\nlightning bolt strikes between her and the boulder, destroying the precipice\nand sending the Queen (along with the boulder) down the cliff to her death,\nscreaming while she falls to the jagged rocks below (this scream was reused in\n_[Sleeping Beauty](/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_\\(1959_film\\) \"Sleeping Beauty \\(1959\nfilm\\)\")_ when [Maleficent](/wiki/Maleficent \"Maleficent\") is stabbed in the\nheart by the Sword of Truth). As the Dwarfs look wide-eyed over the cliff's\nedge, they cannot see her, but the vultures descend into the chasm. The\nQueen's dark reign is over, and her castle is then taken over and the revived\nSnow White and the Prince who broke the spell. (A 1936 pre-release _[Good\nHousekeeping](/wiki/Good_Housekeeping \"Good Housekeeping\")_ novelization by\nDorothy Ann Blank, a member of the film's story team, affirms that the Queen\nin fact dies: \"Far below, in a chasm as dark as her own wicked soul, lay the\nbody of the hateful Queen. No magic would ever bring her to life again.\"[7])\n\n### Conception, design and\nportrayal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evil_Queen_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Conception, design and portrayal\")]\n\nEarly concepts for the film called for a \"fat, batty, cartoon type, self-\nsatisfied\" Queen. However, [Walt Disney](/wiki/Walt_Disney \"Walt Disney\")\nbecame concerned that such an approach would make the character seem less\nplausible. Sensing that more time was needed for the development of the Queen,\nhe advised that attention be paid exclusively to \"scenes in which only Snow\nWhite, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear.\"[14] Disney\nfurther developed the main plot himself ([Ollie Johnston](/wiki/Ollie_Johnston\n\"Ollie Johnston\") said the film's story was based on the idea that the Queen's\ncharacter was going to murder \"another drawing\" and Disney decided to make it\nappear believable[15]), finding a dilemma in the characterization of the\nQueen, whom he envisioned as a mixture of [Lady Macbeth](/wiki/Lady_Macbeth\n\"Lady Macbeth\") and the [Big Bad Wolf](/wiki/Big_Bad_Wolf \"Big Bad\nWolf\"),[16][17] and decided to set on \"a high collar stately beautiful\ntype\"[18] whose \"beauty is sinister, mature, plenty of curves – she becomes\nugly and menacing when scheming.\"[10] According to the 1993 Disney Classics\nseries of trading cards, \"she is really two characters, the beautiful evil\nQueen and the grotesquely evil witch.\"\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Naumburg-\nUta.JPG/170px-Naumburg-Uta.JPG)](/wiki/File:Naumburg-Uta.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Naumburg-Uta.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nStatue

\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Joan Crawford](/wiki/Joan_Crawford \"Joan Crawford\") c. 1930\n\nThe Queen's appearance was inspired by the \"ageless ice goddess\"[19] character\nof Queen Ayesha (\"She who must be obeyed\") from the 1935 film\n_[She](/wiki/She_\\(1935_film\\) \"She \\(1935 film\\)\")_ , played by [Helen\nGahagan](/wiki/Helen_Gahagan \"Helen Gahagan\").[20][21] The Queen was\noriginally to be named Grimhilde[10] (but who is never actually named in the\nfilm[22]), was also modeled in part on Princess [Kriemhild](/wiki/Kriemhild\n\"Kriemhild\") in the 1924 film _[Die Nibelungen](/wiki/Die_Nibelungen \"Die\nNibelungen\")_.[23] It is also possible that the Queen's looks may have been\ninspired by the faces of [Joan Crawford](/wiki/Joan_Crawford \"Joan\nCrawford\")[24] and [Gale Sondergaard](/wiki/Gale_Sondergaard \"Gale\nSondergaard\");[25] her costume and figure may have been inspired by a column\nstatue at the [Naumburg Cathedral](/wiki/Naumburg_Cathedral \"Naumburg\nCathedral\") depicting [Uta von Ballenstedt](/wiki/Uta_von_Ballenstedt \"Uta von\nBallenstedt\"), the wife of [Eckard II, Margrave of\nMeissen](/wiki/Eckard_II,_Margrave_of_Meissen \"Eckard II, Margrave of\nMeissen\") who was widely regarded as the most beautiful woman of [Medieval\nGermany](/wiki/Germany_in_the_Middle_Ages \"Germany in the Middle\nAges\").[26][27] Also noted was her resemblance to two 1930s American movie\nstars from Europe, [Greta Garbo](/wiki/Greta_Garbo \"Greta Garbo\") and [Marlene\nDietrich](/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich \"Marlene Dietrich\").[28] The Queen and Snow\nWhite were refined by [Grim Natwick](/wiki/Grim_Natwick \"Grim Natwick\") and\n[Norm Ferguson](/wiki/Norm_Ferguson_\\(animator\\) \"Norm Ferguson\n\\(animator\\)\"), who would often override Walt Disney's instructions.[29] As in\nthe case of other characters for the film, the Queen's appearance had to be\napproved by Albert Hurter before being finalised.[14] One pre-final version of\nthe queen had her wear a looser hood and a different crown and the edge of her\ncape was fur trimmed, as it can be seen in [Gustaf\nTenggren](/wiki/Gustaf_Tenggren \"Gustaf Tenggren\")'s pictures.[30][31]\n\nNone of [Art Babbit](/wiki/Art_Babbit \"Art Babbit\")'s lead animation work on\nthe character was [rotoscoped](/wiki/Rotoscoping \"Rotoscoping\")[32][33] and\nthe animators were noted to prefer to draw the Queen over Snow White \"because\nshe was more real and complex as a woman, more erotic, and driven to desperate\nacts by her magic mirror.\"[34] The character, however, turned out to be\nespecially problematic for the animators, as she had to be \"regally beautiful,\nwith confined but graceful movements,\" and \"the experiments on her lovely\ncruel mouth and eyes alone represent drawings enough to fill a paper\nhouse.\"[35] The sequence of her transformation in particular was the film's\ntoughest to visualise using trick effects,[36] especially since Disney\ninsisted on showing how the Queen felt as she changed.[35]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Alc%C3%A1zar_de_Segovia-7.jpg/170px-\nAlc%C3%A1zar_de_Segovia-7.jpg)](/wiki/File:Alc%C3%A1zar_de_Segovia-7.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Alc%C3%A1zar_de_Segovia-7.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Alcázar of Segovia](/wiki/Alc%C3%A1zar_of_Segovia \"Alcázar of Segovia\") in\n2011\n\nAccording to a description in her card in the Disney Villains set, \"the\nWitch's ugliness symbolises the evil disguised by the Queen's beauty.\" Her\ncastle might have been inspired by Spain's [Alcázar of\nSegovia](/wiki/Alc%C3%A1zar_of_Segovia \"Alcázar of Segovia\")[37][38][39] and\nthe throne she is uses has a [peacock\nmotif](/wiki/Peafowl#Cultural_significance \"Peafowl\") to symbolise her extreme\nvanity.[40] The Queen is clad mostly in black and other \"negative\" dark\ncolors, providing a contrast to Snow White's bright colorful wardrobe,[41] and\nhas \"shiny black hair\" under her hood.[7] Her royal costume was painted with\nspecially developed paints made to look like satin for her collar and like\nvelvet for her robe.[35] The Queen's music tracks were created with low celio\nnotes, basses, and bassoons; the scribblings in her book of spells were\nwritten in Italian.[42]\n\nNotably, the Queen was the first character to ever speak in an animated\nfeature film.[43] She was voiced by [Lucille La Verne](/wiki/Lucille_La_Verne\n\"Lucille La Verne\"), who achieved her voice change for the role of the Witch\nby removing her false teeth.[44] [Joe Grant](/wiki/Joe_Grant \"Joe Grant\"), who\ncontributed the design for her Witch form,[45] noticed La Verne's changing\nattitude and posture when voicing the Queen and Witch, and sketched these\nposes and her [body language](/wiki/Body_language \"Body language\") down for\nanimation reference.[46] He also said he based the Witch's concept art on a\nwoman who lived across the street from him.[47] The character's foreign\ndubbing voice actresses included [Jiřina\nPetrovická](/wiki/Ji%C5%99ina_Petrovick%C3%A1 \"Jiřina Petrovická\") in\nCzechoslovakia, [Clara Pontoppidan](/wiki/Clara_Pontoppidan \"Clara\nPontoppidan\"), [Kirsten

in a Disney film.[48] As\npart of elimination of the original story's more gruesome aspects, and to make\nSnow White seem more a \"nice girl\",[6] the Wicked Queen is no longer\ncannibalistic and her destruction was made \"just as certain but more merciful\"\nthan in the original story, where she is forced to dance to her death in red-\nhot iron shoes on her feet as an invited guest at Snow White's\nwedding.[31][49] Snow White's role in the Queen's demise is removed, and the\nQueen \"dies more neatly and quickly,\"[6] as justice is served without\nresorting to killing or torture.

The envious Queen would\nalso decide to take possession of Snow White's attractive young suitor, the\n18-year-old[10] Prince (described in a press kit as \"every woman's dream\nman\"[36]) for herself, offering him an opportunity to share the throne with\nher through a marriage.[53][54] With the Prince refusing to marry her, the\nQueen would have him captured by her guards and taken to her dungeon to be\nsuspended in chains in a [torture chamber](/wiki/Torture_chamber \"Torture\nchamber\").[55] She would later visit him there and used her sorcery to taunt\nhim by bringing the dungeon's skeletons (also chained to the walls) to life\nand making them dance, identifying one skeleton as \"Prince Oswald\",[10] only\nfor the Prince to defy her again. She then has him given to the torturers,\ndescribed as \"the [Nubians](/wiki/Nubia \"Nubia\")\",[56] and \"exits with a dirty\nlaugh.\"[57]\n\nAccording to production story-meeting notes from October 1934, \"Queen wants to\nmarry Prince, but he refuses to acknowledge 'that she is the fairest in the\nland,' since he has seen Snow White.\"[58] It is written in story notes that\nthe Queen has magical power only over her own domain, which is the castle.[56]\nAnother note states about their meeting in the dungeon: \"This is a sequence of\ngruesome comedy ― of dancing skeletons ― fantastic shadows ― witchcraft and\ndeviltry.\"[59] The name Prince Oswald was an inside joke reference to [Oswald\nthe Lucky Rabbit](/wiki/Oswald_the_Lucky_Rabbit \"Oswald the Lucky\nRabbit\").[54] The Queen was originally intended to have seven [black\npanthers](/wiki/Black_panther \"Black panther\") guarding the entrance to her\nsecret room with the Mirror;[7] a concept art of the Queen walking a pet\npanther can be seen in [The Walt Disney Family\nMuseum](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Family_Museum \"The Walt Disney Family Museum\")\nand at [Disney California Adventure](/wiki/Disney_California_Adventure \"Disney\nCalifornia Adventure\").\n\nThe books _Snow White: Magic Mirror Book_ and _The Complete Story of Walt\nDisney 's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_ reveal that the Huntsman was afraid\nto disobey a command to kill Snow White because the Queen's might feed him to\nher panthers or shrink him magically \"to the size of a walnut\".[53][60] In one\n1937 novelization, the Queen vows the Huntsman would pay dearly for allowing\nher stepdaughter to escape, but first she would deal with Snow White\nherself.[61] In another version, the Huntsman would too be dragged to the\ndungeon when the Queen finds out that he has betrayed her,[53] and the Queen\nmight smash her own Mirror in anger.[54][62] Later, after transforming\nherself, she decides to punish the Prince for having scorned her. She informs\nthe Prince of her plan to have the Dwarfs bury Snow White alive and then\nleaves him to his death, still chained and trapped in a subterranean chamber\nfilling with water[45] to slowly drown. She then makes her way to the Dwarfs'\ncottage with the poisoned apple, while birds and forest animals were to help\nthe Prince escape the Queen's minions and find his horse as would race to try\nand save Snow White.[63][64]\n\nThis plotline described above was not used in the final film, although it was\ncarried out to the drawing and [cel](/wiki/Cel \"Cel\") stage,[65] and several\ninspirational sketch pictures of the dungeon scenes were drawn by Ferdinand\nHovarth. It is said that Disney \"knew that the Queen would have to look scary\nwithout being too scary.\"[16] Some skeletons are briefly featured in the\nfinished film in the other parts of the dungeon,[66] except in Australia's\ncensored original theatrical release version.[67] Similar motifs and scenes\nwere later used in _Sleeping Beauty_[31][64] and\n_[Aladdin](/wiki/Aladdin_\\(1992_Disney_film\\) \"Aladdin \\(1992 Disney\nfilm\\)\")_.

In 2013's [HD remake of _Castle of\nIllusion_](/wiki/Castle_of_Illusion_Starring_Mickey_Mouse_\\(2013_video_game\\)\n\"Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse \\(2013 video game\\)\"), Mizrabel\nlooks like a cross between the Queen and Maleficent in her youthful form and\nprofesses her ambition to be \"the fairest of them all\".\n\nThe Evil Queen is also featured in a number of traditional games, albeit\nusually as a mere obstacle for the players.[115][116][117] She is, however,\nplayable in some of them, such as _Snow White and the Severn Dwarfs Game_ in\nthe Disneykins franchise[118] and _Disney Villains Collector 's Edition\nMonopoly_.[119]\n\nJim Razzi's 1985 children's gamebook _Snow White in the Enchanted Forest\n(Choose Your Own Adventure: Walt Disney #1)_ features the Prince-like\ncharacter's confrontations with evil Queen as she is searching for Snow White,\nwho is hiding with the Dwarfs, to \"put an end to her, once and for all!\"[120]\nIn it, she has much greater powers than in the film, including being able to\ninstantly change between her hag and queen forms at will,[121] magically\ndisappear in a cloud of smoke,[122] change herself into an animal and back,\nand turn others into animals with magic beams from her hands.[123]\n\n###\nComics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evil_Queen_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Comics\")]\n\nThe 1937–1938 film tie-in serial comic strip \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\"\nwritten by [Merrill De Maris](/wiki/Merrill_De_Maris \"Merrill De Maris\"), one\nof the writers of the film,[124] is centred primarily around the relationship\nbetween Snow White and the Queen. It further explores the source of the\nQueen's descent into a murderous envy, as she learns that the Prince came to\nher castle seeking the most beautiful woman in all the world and is shocked\nwhen he says he meant Snow White. Like in the abandoned film concept, the\nQueen (here actually named Grimhilde) has the Prince arrested. In her Witch\nform, she later tells the captive Prince that she is going to get rid of Snow\nWhite and make him hers, while the Prince is defiant and calls her a\n\"miserable hag\".[10] This scene is followed by his escape from prison, in much\nless dramatic circumstances than the film's drowning concept.[125] The film\nwas also adapted into an other comics including in 1969,[126] 1983,[127] and\n1991.[128]\n\nThere is a number of comics set in the film's world. One early comic _Pamuk\nPrenses ile Sevimli Prens_ (1942) tells of the further adventures of Snow\nWhite and Prince Charming, the Witch returns to put a spell on the\nlatter.[129][130] In one American 1944 sequel comic, the dead Queen's castle\nis taken over by her brother, the Wicked Prince.[131] Later comics usually\nfeature the Queen in her Witch incarnation,[132] often with her still trying\nto eliminate either Snow White (\"The Seven Dwarfs and Thumper\",[133] \"No Ritmo\nDa Bruxa\",[134] \"A Maçã Superenfeitiçada\",[135] \"Kerstverhaal\"[136]) or the\ndwarfs (\"The Enchanted Mountain\",[137] \"Halloween\"[138]). Such stories include\n[Jack Bradbury](/wiki/Jack_Bradbury \"Jack Bradbury\")'s stand-alone 1958 comics\n_Mystery of the Missing Magic_[139] and _A New Adventure of Snow White and the\nSeven Dwarfs_.[140] In the comic \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Witch-Queen\",[141]\nthe Witch shrinks all the dwarfs except of Dopey who manages to save his\nbrothers.[142] In \"A Pirate's Tale\" (aka \"The Pirate\"[143]), the greedy old\nWitch transforms herself into a rat as she plans to steal a treasure and turn\nthe dwarfs into cheese and eat them, but Dopey destroys her with a cat.[144]\n\nUsually under the alias the Witch, she often comes back to interact (usually\nto antagonize, but sometimes also to occasionally cooperating with\nprotagonistic characters) with other Disney characters.[145] She has appeared\nin the comics of April, May and June,[146] the [Beagle Boys](/wiki/Beagle_Boys\n\"Beagle Boys\"),[147] [Br'er Rabbit](/wiki/Br%27er_Rabbit \"Br'er Rabbit\"),[148]\n[Chip 'n Dale](/wiki/Chip_%27n_Dale \"Chip 'n Dale\"),[149] [Donald\nDuck](/wiki/Donald_Duck \"Donald Duck\") & Mickey Mouse,[150]\n[Goofy](/wiki/Goofy \"Goofy\"),[151] [Huey, Dewey, and\nLouie](/wiki/Huey,_Dewey,_and_Louie \"Huey, Dewey, and Louie\"),[152] Jiminy\nCricket,[153] [José Carioca](/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Carioca \"José Carioca\"),[154]\nMickey & Minnie Mouse,[155] Li'l Bad Wolf,[156] [Tinker\nBell](/wiki/Tinker_Bell \"Tinker Bell\"),[157] the Three Little Pigs,[158] and\nthe fellow witches such as Madam Mim from _[The Sword in the\nStone](/wiki/The_Sword_in_the_Stone_\\(film\\) \"The Sword in the Stone\n\\(film\\)\")_ ,[159] Witch Hazel from _[Trick or\nTreat](/wiki/Trick_or_Treat_\\(1952_film\\) \"Trick or Treat \\(1952 film\\)\")_ ,\nand [Magica De Spell](/wiki/Magica_De_Spell \"Magica De Spell\") (especially in\nBrazilian comics).[160] She also starred in the 1970s-1980's comic book series\n_The Big Bad Wolf & The Wicked Witch_, including \"Mirror Mirror\",[161] \"Witch\nSwitch\",[162] \"The Apple Caper\",[163] \"The High-Hopping Wolf\",[164] \"Double\nTrouble\",[165] and \"Getting the Boot\".[166]\n\nSeveral comics include the Witch kidnapping another Disney character, either\nto be her slave or to exchange them for something, until they are rescued.\nExample of this include her abducting, besides Snow White (\"Diamond Dust\nDilemma\",[167] \"The Weather Witch\"[168]), such characters as Chip 'n' Dale\n(\"Witch Convention\",[169]), Tinker Bell (\"Pixie Dust Dilemma\"[170] \"The Big\nBust-out\"[171]), and _[Dumbo](/wiki/Dumbo \"Dumbo\")_ characters (\"Dumbo\".[172]\n\"The Chips Are Flying\",[173] \"A Witch in Time\"[174]). The Witch also captures\nDumbo in \"Dumbo l'échappe belle\",[175] but is defeated by Mickey and [Br'er\nBear](/wiki/Br%27er_Fox_and_Br%27er_Bear \"Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear\") and\nimprisoned by the Dwarfs.[176] In \"The Gingerbread House\", the Witch captures\nthe [Wicked Witch of the West](/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_West \"Wicked Witch of\nthe West\")'s children Witch Child and Warlock whom Magica De Spell was tasked\nto look after.[177] Another recurring motif is the Witch's attempts to turn\ncharacters into gold, for example Pinocchio (\"The Magic Brew\"[178]) or all the\nforest animals ( \"Get Rich Witch\"[179]). She may also simply try to steal the\ntreasures, from either the Dwarfs (\"Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs\",[180]\n\"Verjongingsdrank\"[181]) or other characters (\"Black Magic Menace\",[182]\n\"Pursuit of Plunder\"[166]). In the prequel story _Battle of Wits and Witches_\n, the Queen turns into the hag to steal a diamond from the Dwarfs but is foile\nby Mickey and Goofy.[183] She also repeatedly attempts to ruin Christmas, like\nin \"The Golden Christmas Tree\", where she lures Huey, Dewey and Louie to her\nlair use their tear drops in a magic potion to destroy all the Christmas trees\nin the world,[184] and in \"Delivery Problems\" where she plots to put Santa\nClaus' reindeer to sleep.[185]\n\nIn the _[Walt Disney's Comics and\nStories](/wiki/Walt_Disney%27s_Comics_and_Stories \"Walt Disney's Comics and\nStories\")_ parody of _[The Wonderful Wizard of\nOz](/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\")_ , \"The\nWizard of Bahs\" by [Vic Lockman](/wiki/Vic_Lockman \"Vic Lockman\") and\nStrobl,[186] the Witch is unexpectedly turned into an old tree trunk by [Daisy\nDuck](/wiki/Daisy_Duck \"Daisy Duck\") while her castle turns to sand.[187] In\n\"The Captured Castle\", the Witch captures Cinderella's castle,[188] and in\n\"It's Snow Joke\" she turns Dale's snow dragon alive.[189] In \"The Magic Spell\"\nChip 'n' Dale steal her flying powder.[190] The Witch's Magic Wand is obtained\nby Goofy in \"Magic-Mender\"[191] and stolen by the Big Bad Wolf in \"The Magic\nWand\".[192] In \"The Haunted House Caper\", the Witch turns Donald Duck's into a\nhaunted one,[193] a story continued in \"13 Blackcat Road\".[194] In _O\nSindicato Das Bruxas_ , José Carioca fights against her syndicate of\nwitches.[195] In \"The Washed-up Witch\",[196] where she ends up deprived of her\npowers and accepting [Scrooge McDuck](/wiki/Scrooge_McDuck \"Scrooge McDuck\")'s\noffer to become his private secretary.[197][198] In \"The Sitter Solution\",\nMickey hires the Witch as a babysitter for Morty and Ferdie.[199]\n\nMany stories, notably usually featuring the Queen in her youthful form, have\nbeen first published in Italian Disney digest comic series,[200] in particular\nin _[Topolino](/wiki/Topolino \"Topolino\")_. They include \"The Seven Dwarfs and\nthe Evil Witch\" (_I Sette Nani e la Strega Malvagia_), \"Snow White and the\nBroken Mirror\" (_Biancaneve e lo specchio infranto_),[201] \"The Seven Dwarfs\nand the Spell of the Queen\" (_I Sette Nani e l 'incantesimo della\nregina_),[202] \"Snow White and the Castle of Four Winds\" (_Biancaneve al\ncastello dei quattro venti_),[203] \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Heroic Antieve\"\n(_I Sette Nani e l 'eroica antivigilia_),[204] \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Brew\nof Seven Herbs\" (_I Sette Nani e l 'infuso delle sette erbe_ aka \"The Seven\nHerbs Spell!\"),[205] \"Snow White and the Silver Rose\" (_Biancaneve e la rosa d\n'argento_),[206] and \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Joker Wizard\" (_I Sette Nani e\nil mago burlone_),[207] among others. For instance, \"Snow White and the\nShattered Mirror\" (_Biancaneve e lo specchio infranto_),[208] has the old\nWitch, terminally ill, discover she has only one day to live, but she refuses\nto accept her destiny and finds a way to conquer death. In \"Goofy the Magician\nand the Seven Dwarfs\" (_Pippo mago e i Sette Nani_),[209] the Queen's four\ngoon henchmen attack the dwarfs and steal their treasure but then decide to\nkeep it for themselves and Grimhilde seeks help from the wizard Abracadabro to\nstop their run; eventually, it is the Prince who defeats the robbers. \"Donald\nFracasse: (_Paperin Fracassa_) is a parody of the adventure film _[Captain\nFracasse](/wiki/Captain_Fracasse_\\(1961_film\\) \"Captain Fracasse \\(1961\nfilm\\)\")_ in which Snow White is blinded by the Queen and Donald Duck needs to\nheal her. In \"The Seven Dwarfs and Christmas in Danger\" (_I Sette Nani e il\nNatale in pericolo_)[210] the Queen goes to steal a comet stardust as the last\ningredient for her spell to destroy Snow White. In \"The Seven Dwarfs and the\nCovenant of the Queen\" (_I Sette Nani e il patto della regina_),[211] she\nconjures the demon Shadow Lord Oren and makes a pact with him to take the soul\nof Snow White. She once again attempts to eliminate Snow White with the help\nof seven evil dwarfs, but in doing so she burns ends up burning all of her\nvital energy and Oren takes her with him.[212] \"The Seven Dwarfs and the\nChristmas Fairy\" (_I Sette Nani e la fatina di Natale_) presents a scenario in\nwhich the Queen successfully casts a forever-sleep enchantement on Snow White,\nbut while trying to zap Dopey she accidentally falls victim of her own\nwitchcraft and the Christmas fairy, freed from her prison, saves Snow\nWhite.[213][214] In Italian comics, the Queen is usually wearing a red robe.\nShe is also often shown using a [crystal ball](/wiki/Crystal_ball \"Crystal\nball\") to spy on the good characters.[205][206][215]\n\nMany of the _Topolino_ Snow White comics were the works of [Romano\nScarpa](/wiki/Romano_Scarpa \"Romano Scarpa\"). His 1986 comic \"The Seven Dwarfs\nand King Arbor's Crystal\" (_I Sette Nani e il cristallo di Re Arbor_) provides\nexplanation how the Queen would have survived her apparent death in the film\n(as some branches and bushes eased the fall and she was rescued by her loyal\nguards) and why she could not change back to her normal self (as her castle\nwas burned down by the Huntsman and her book of magic is gone). In this story,\nGrimhilde (Grimilde) enlists the aid of her great admirer and past suitor, the\nevil King Arbor of Vegetalia, in a plot to use a magic crystal device to swap\nher old body with Snow White's.[216][217] The intrigue is foiled by the\ndwarves who destroy the crystal, and the resigned Arbor allows the Witch to\nlive with her, saying he will try to remember she _was_ \"the most beautiful\namong queens\". The uneasy relationship between Grimhilde and Abor continued in\nthe comic \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Fountainhead\" (_I Sette nani e la fonte\nmeravigliosa_),[218][219] in which she desperately attempts to regain her\nyouth, but instead only turns into a childlike version of her Witch form for a\nshort time.\n\nOther comics by Romano Scarpa have the Queen in her youthful form.[220] In the\nthree-part \"Snow White and the Green Flame\" (_Biancaneve e verde\nfiamma_),[215][221][222] the Queen flies on a broom to the great gathering of\nwitches, who declare that her inability to deal with just a little girl and\nfew dwarfs has disgraced them all and she should be punished for this\naccording to the laws of Hell. The Queen begs the High Witch for mercy and is\ngiven a magic wand with the power of transformation, but if she would not\nsucceed this time she will be turned into a magic broom for a more \"honorable\"\nwitch to fly. The Queen uses the wand to gain trust of Snow White and turn her\na figurine, than takes the princess' form to ambush the dwarfs and do the same\nwith them, and waits for the Prince's arrival to kill him. Only Dopey escapes\nand eventually manages to outwit the Queen, using her want to restore his\nfriends and transform her into a figurine, which later turns into a broom when\nher sentence is carried over. In \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Throne of Diamonds\"\n(_I Sette Nani e il trono di diamanti_),[223] Jiminy Cricket is deeply\nenamored by the Queen's beauty and attempts to convince her to become good,\nbut the Queen refuses to be redeemed and orders her soldiers to steal the\nthrone the Dwarfs make for Snow White in a plot to turn her rival into an old\nwoman. Eventually, the Queen is defeated by another witch Tardona and Snow\nWhite is saved. \"Snow White and the Chained Fairy\" (_I Sette Nani e la fata\nincatenata_),[224] sees the dwarfs struggle to free the fairy Fawn who was\ncaptured by the Queen in an underground cavern for saving Snow White when\nGrimhilde flew to strike down the princess with a thunderbolt. She takes on\nmany forms trying to thwart them in various ways, and one-by-one the dwarfs\nsacrifice their lives, until only Dopey remains but he manages to get hold of\nmagical water that brings back all of them to life. The freed fairy's magic\nmakes the cavern collapse down on the helpless Queen to make sure she will\nnever hurt anyone again. In \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Birtch Ring\" (_I Sette\nNani e l 'anello di betulla_ by Romano Scarpa),[225] the Queen learns about\nthe eight Dwarf named Ginger (Zenzero), who has left the his companions to go\nin search of fortune traveling the world, and transforms into a pixie named\nFagottina to send him home and sow discord among his brothers.[226] The Queen\nalso transforms into a pixie, named Fogliolina, in \"Snow White and Easter in\nthe Woods\" (_Biancaneve e la Pasqua nel bosco_),[227] where, after her attempt\nto kill Snow White with magic is foiled by woodland creatures, she is so\nenraged that she calls upon the infernal powers to \"take her\" and her castle\nburns into flames and crumbles around her. In \"The Seven Dwarfs and the Wolf's\nCliff\" (_I Sette Nani e la balza del lupo_),[228] she sends three of her\nbandit minions (Bragia, Sghembo and Schidione) to kidnap Snow White. \"Snow\nWhite and the Bewitched Dress\" (_Biancaneve e l 'abito stregato_)[229] has the\nQueen magically disguise herself as an old gypsy to give Snow White a cursed\ndress and capture her, then start her work on the spell to rid of the dwarfs\nand all the forest creatures. But Dopey infiltrates her castle, frees Snow\nWhite, and locks up the Queen in her laboratory set ablaze, after which the\nwhole castle is consumed by fire and explodes after the dwarf and the princess\nescape.\n\nThe Queen also appears as one of the villains in the 2005 Disney manga series\n_[Kilala Princess](/wiki/Kilala_Princess \"Kilala Princess\")_ by Rika Tanaka\nand Nao Kodaka, where the protagonists Rei and Kilala Reno find themselves in\nthe world of Snow White, and meet and befriend the princess. They go the\nQueen's castle to ask the Magic Mirror how to find Kilala's friend Erika, but\ndiscover the Queen is still alive (and even commanding the two vultures, as\nwell as wolves) as she appears and demands Kilala's magical tiara. The\nchildren try to flee but are attacked by wolves and locked up in the dungeon,\nwhere the Queen transforms into the Witch and prepares to turn Kilala into an\nugly creature. Snow White appears and agrees to sacrifice herself to save\nthem, but Kilala stops her at last moment before she can eat a poison apple;\nRei then attacks the Queen, who falls into her cauldron, turns into a vulture,\nand flies away in a defeat.\n\n###\nMerchandise[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evil_Queen_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Merchandise\")]\n\nThe character was also featured in a wide variety of Disney merchandise, such\nas in the Designer Villains \"stylized and fashion-forward\" series of limited\nedition dolls and make-up products,[230] or the Wickedly Beautiful entry in\nthe Beautifully Disney collection of cosmetic products.[231] Various other\nsuch merchandise include many dolls,[232][233] figurines/statuettes,[234][235]\ncostumes,[236] clothing items,[237][238] watches/clocks/mirrors,[239][240] key\nchains/blanks,[241] mugs,[242][243] other tableware,[244][245]\nbags/purses/suitcases,[246][247] containers,[248][249]\nprints/posters/cards/stickers,[250][251] pins/buttons/magnets,[252][253]\nholiday ornaments,[254] plush toys,[255] puzzles,[256] other beauty\nproducts,[257][258] and so forth.[259] In one issue of _[Disney\nAdventures](/wiki/Disney_Adventures \"Disney Adventures\")_ in 1997, the Evil\nQueen appeared on the cover attempting to woo [Will Smith](/wiki/Will_Smith\n\"Will Smith\").[260][261]\n\nOne hand-made figure costing $2,000 was the most expensive out of 200,000\nitems being sold at the Disney World shopping village in 1985.[262] During an\nauction in 1988, an animation cel from the iconic scene of the Queen holding\nher heart box sold for a record-setting price of $30,000.[263] In 1997,\nanother cel from the same scene sold for $21,275 and a cel of the Witch\noffering an apple to Snow White realized $13,800.[264] Another cel showing the\nQueen reading her spellbook sold for $8,050 in an earlier in auction in\n1995.[265] In 2015, a Hag cell was sold on an aution for $48,000.[266]\n\n## In _Once Upon a\nTime_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Evil_Queen_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: In Once Upon a Time\")]\n\nMain article: [Regina Mills](/wiki/Regina_Mills \"Regina Mills\")\n\nAn almost entirely alternate take on the character of the Evil Queen is Regina\nMills, the main antagonist in the first season of the 2011\n[ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\")\nlive-action TV series _[Once Upon a Time](/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_\\(TV_series\\)\n\"Once Upon a Time \\(TV series\\)\")_ where she is played by [Lana\nParrilla](/wiki/Lana_Parrilla \"Lana Parrilla\").

An abandoned concept from _Snow White_ was that the Queen\nkidnap the Prince and lock him in her dungeon; similarly, in _Sleeping Beauty_\n, Maleficent kidnaps Prince Philip.[312] Lady Bane, a vain evil sorceress from\n_[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi\nBears](/wiki/Disney%27s_Adventures_of_the_Gummi_Bears \"Disney's Adventures of\nthe Gummi Bears\")_, too bears a similarity to the Evil Queen in her costume\nand character.
