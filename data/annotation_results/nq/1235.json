It\nis one of the few government agencies [explicitly\nauthorized](/wiki/Postal_Clause \"Postal Clause\") by the [United States\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\").\n\nThe U.S. Mail traces its roots to 1775 during the [Second Continental\nCongress](/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress \"Second Continental Congress\"),\nwhen [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\") was\nappointed the first [postmaster\ngeneral](/wiki/United_States_Postmaster_General \"United States Postmaster\nGeneral\"). The [Post Office\nDepartment](/wiki/United_States_Post_Office_Department \"United States Post\nOffice Department\") was created in [1792](/wiki/Postal_Service_Act \"Postal\nService Act\") from Franklin's operation, elevated to a [cabinet-\nlevel](/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States \"Cabinet of the United States\")\ndepartment in 1872, and transformed in 1971 into the U.S. Postal Service as an\nindependent agency.\n\nThe USPS as of February 2015 has 617,254 active employees and operated 211,264\nvehicles in 2014. The USPS is the operator of the largest civilian [vehicle\nfleet](/wiki/Vehicle_fleet \"Vehicle fleet\") in the world.[2] The USPS is\nlegally obligated to serve all Americans, regardless of geography, at uniform\nprice and quality. The USPS has exclusive access to [letter\nboxes](/wiki/Letter_box \"Letter box\") marked \"U.S. Mail\" and personal\nletterboxes in the United States, but now has to compete against private\n[package delivery](/wiki/Package_delivery \"Package delivery\") services, such\nas [United Parcel Service](/wiki/United_Parcel_Service \"United Parcel\nService\") and [FedEx](/wiki/FedEx \"FedEx\").[4]\n\nSince the early 1980s, many of the direct tax subsidies to the Post Office,\nwith the exception of subsidies for costs associated with the disabled and\noverseas voters, have been reduced or eliminated in favor of indirect\nsubsidies, in addition to the advantages associated with a government-enforced\nmonopoly on the delivery of first-class mail.[5] Since the 2006 all-time peak\nmail volume,[6] after which Congress passed the [Postal Accountability and\nEnhancement\nAct](/wiki/Postal_Regulatory_Commission#Changes_under_the_Postal_Accountability_and_Enhancement_Act_of_2006\n\"Postal Regulatory Commission\")[7] which mandated that $5.5 billion per year\nbe paid to fully prefund employee retirement health benefits,[8] revenue\ndropped sharply due to recession-influenced[9] declining mail volume,[10]\nprompting the postal service to look to other sources of revenue while cutting\ncosts to reduce its budget deficit.[11]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Foundations\n    * 1.2 The American Revolution\n    * 1.3 19th century\n    * 1.4 20th century\n  * 2 Current operations\n    * 2.1 Five-year plans\n    * 2.2 Initiatives\n  * 3 Budget\n    * 3.1 Revenue decline and planned cuts\n      * 3.1.1 Declining mail volume\n      * 3.1.2 Internal streamlining and delivery slowdown\n      * 3.1.3 Post office closures\n      * 3.1.4 Elimination of Saturday delivery averted\n    * 3.2 Retirement funding and payment defaults\n    * 3.3 Rate increases\n    * 3.4 Reform packages, delivery changes, and alcohol delivery\n  * 4 Governance and organization\n  * 5 Universal service obligation and monopoly status\n    * 5.1 Legal basis and rationale\n    * 5.2 2008 report on universal postal service and the postal monopoly\n    * 5.3 Competitors\n    * 5.4 Alternative transmission methods\n    * 5.5 Criticism of the universal service requirement and the postal monopoly\n  * 6 Law enforcement agencies\n    * 6.1 Postal Inspection Service\n    * 6.2 Office of Inspector General\n  * 7 How delivery services work\n    * 7.1 Elements of addressing and preparing domestic mail\n      * 7.1.1 Delivery Point Validation\n    * 7.2 Paying postage\n      * 7.2.1 Postage meters\n      * 7.2.2 PC postage\n    * 7.3 Other electronic postage payment methods\n      * 7.3.1 Stamp copyright and reproduction\n    * 7.4 Service level choices\n      * 7.4.1 General domestic services\n      * 7.4.2 Bulk mail\n      * 7.4.3 Extra services\n    * 7.5 International services\n      * 7.5.1 The discontinuation of international surface mail\n    * 7.6 Sorting and delivery process\n      * 7.6.1 Types of postal facilities\n        * 7.6.1.1 Automated Postal Centers\n      * 7.6.2 Evolutionary Network Development (END) program\n      * 7.6.3 Airline and rail division\n      * 7.6.4 Parcel forwarding and private interchange\n    * 7.7 Delivery timing\n      * 7.7.1 Delivery days\n      * 7.7.2 Direct delivery vs. customer pickup\n      * 7.7.3 Special delivery\n      * 7.7.4 Same-day trials\n      * 7.7.5 Forwarding and holds\n  * 8 Financial services\n  * 9 Employment in the USPS\n    * 9.1 Workplace violence\n  * 10 In fiction\n  * 11 See also\n  * 12 References\n  * 13 Further reading\n  * 14 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nFurther information: [Postage stamps and postal history of the United\nStates](/wiki/Postage_stamps_and_postal_history_of_the_United_States \"Postage\nstamps and postal history of the United States\")\n\n###\nFoundations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Foundations\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Seal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_the_Post_Office.svg/220px-\nSeal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_the_Post_Office.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Seal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_the_Post_Office.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Seal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_the_Post_Office.svg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nRunning pony logo used by the [U.S. Post Office\nDepartment](/wiki/U.S._Post_Office_Department \"U.S. Post Office Department\")\nbefore the creation of the USPS\n\nIn the early years of the [North American colonies](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies\n\"Thirteen Colonies\"), many attempts were made to initiate a postal service.\nThese early attempts were of small scale and usually involved a colony,\nMassachusetts Bay Colony for example, setting up a location in Boston where\none could post a letter back home to England. Other attempts focused on a\ndedicated postal service between two of the larger colonies, such as\nMassachusetts and Virginia, but the available services remained limited in\nscope and disjointed for many years. For example, informal independently-run\npostal routes operated in [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\") as early as 1639,\nwith a Boston to [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") service\nstarting in 1672.\n\nA central postal organization came to the colonies in 1691, when [Thomas\nNeale](/wiki/Thomas_Neale \"Thomas Neale\") received a 21-year grant from the\nBritish Crown for a **North American Postal Service**. On February 17, 1691, a\ngrant of _[letters patent](/wiki/Letters_patent \"Letters patent\")_ from the\njoint sovereigns, [William III](/wiki/William_III_of_England \"William III of\nEngland\") and [Mary II](/wiki/Mary_II_of_England \"Mary II of England\"),\nempowered him:\n\n> to erect, settle, and establish within the chief parts of their majesties'\n> colonies and plantations in America, an office or offices for receiving and\n> dispatching letters and pacquets, and to receive, send, and deliver the same\n> under such rates and sums of money as the planters shall agree to give, and\n> to hold and enjoy the same for the term of twenty-one years.[12]\n\nThe patent included the exclusive right to establish and collect a formal\npostal tax on official documents of all kinds. The tax was repealed a year\nlater. Neale appointed [Andrew Hamilton](/wiki/Andrew_Hamilton_\\(New_Jersey\\)\n\"Andrew Hamilton \\(New Jersey\\)\"), Governor of New Jersey, as his deputy\npostmaster. The first postal service in America commenced in February 1692.\nRates of postage were fixed and authorized, and measures were taken to\nestablish a post office in each town in [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\").\n[Massachusetts](/wiki/Massachusetts \"Massachusetts\") and the other colonies\nsoon passed postal laws, and a very imperfect post office system was\nestablished. Neale's patent expired in 1710, when Parliament extended the\nEnglish postal system to the colonies. The chief office was established in\n[New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), where letters were\nconveyed by regular packets across the Atlantic.\n\n### The American\nRevolution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: The American Revolution\")]\n\nBefore the Revolution, there was only a trickle of business or governmental\ncorrespondence between the colonies. Most of the mail went back and forth to\ncounting houses and government offices in London. The revolution made\nPhiladelphia, the seat of the Continental Congress, the information hub of the\nnew nation. News, new laws, political intelligence, and military orders\ncirculated with a new urgency, and a postal system was necessary. Journalists\ntook the lead, securing post office legislation that allowed them to reach\ntheir subscribers at very low cost, and to exchange news from newspapers\nbetween the thirteen states. Overthrowing the London-oriented imperial postal\nservice in 1774–1775, printers enlisted merchants and the new political\nleadership, and created a new postal system.[13] The _United States Post\nOffice_ (USPO) was created on July 26, 1775, by decree of the [Second\nContinental Congress](/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress \"Second Continental\nCongress\").[1] [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin\nFranklin\") headed it briefly.\n\nBefore the Revolution, individuals like [Benjamin\nFranklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\") and William Goddard\nwere the colonial postmasters who managed the mails then and were the general\narchitects of a postal system that started out as an alternative to the Crown\nPost.\n\n[The official post office was created in 1792](/wiki/Postal_Service_Act\n\"Postal Service Act\") as the [Post Office\nDepartment](/wiki/United_States_Post_Office_Department \"United States Post\nOffice Department\") (USPOD). It was based on the [Constitutional\nauthority](/wiki/Postal_Clause \"Postal Clause\") empowering Congress \"To\nestablish [post offices](/wiki/Post_office \"Post office\") and [post\nroads](/wiki/Post_road \"Post road\")\". The 1792 law provided for a greatly\nexpanded postal network, and served editors by charging newspapers an\nextremely low rate. The law guaranteed the sanctity of personal\ncorrespondence, and provided the entire country with low-cost access to\ninformation on public affairs, while establishing a right to personal\nprivacy.[14]\n\n[Rufus Easton](/wiki/Rufus_Easton \"Rufus Easton\") was appointed by [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") first postmaster of St.\nLouis under the recommendation of Postmaster General [Gideon\nGranger](/wiki/Gideon_Granger \"Gideon Granger\"). Rufus Easton was the first\npostmaster and built the first post office west of the Mississippi. At the\nsame time Easton was appointed by Thomas Jefferson, judge of [Louisiana\nTerritory](/wiki/Louisiana_Territory \"Louisiana Territory\"), the largest\nterritory in North America. Bruce Adamson wrote that: \"Next to Benjamin\nFranklin, Rufus Easton was one of the most colorful people in United States\nPostal History.\" It was Easton who educated Abraham Lincoln's Attorney\nGeneral, Edward Bates. In 1815 Edward Bates moved into the Easton home and\nlived there for years at Third and Elm. Today this is the site of the\nJefferson Memorial Park. In 1806 Postmaster General Gideon Granger wrote a\nthree-page letter to Easton, begging him not to partake in a duel with vice-\npresident [Aaron Burr](/wiki/Aaron_Burr \"Aaron Burr\"). Two years earlier it\nwas Burr who had shot and killed [Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton\n\"Alexander Hamilton\"). Many years later in 1852, Easton's son, Major-General\nLangdon Cheves Easton, was commissioned by William T. Sherman, at Fort Union\nto deliver a letter to Independence, Missouri. Sherman wrote: \"In the Spring\nof 1852, General Sherman mentioned that the quartermaster, Major L.C. Easton,\nat Fort Union, New Mexico, had occasion to send some message east by a certain\ndate, and contracted with Aubrey to carry it to the nearest post office (then\nIndependence, Missouri), making his compensation conditional on the time\nconsumed. He was supplied with a good horse, and an order on the outgoing\ntrains for exchange. Though the whole route was infested with hostile Indians,\nand not a house on it, Aubrey started alone with his rifle. He was fortunate\nin meeting several outward-bound trains, and thereby made frequent changes of\nhorses, some four or five, and reached Independence in six days, having hardly\nrested or slept the whole way.\"[15]\n\nTo cover long distances, the Post Office used a [hub-and-spoke](/wiki/Spoke-\nhub_distribution_paradigm \"Spoke-hub distribution paradigm\") system, with\nWashington as the hub and chief sorting center. By 1869, with 27,000 local\npost offices to deal with, it had changed to sorting mail en route in\nspecialized railroad mail cars, called [Railway Post\nOffices](/wiki/Railway_Post_Office \"Railway Post Office\"), or RPOs. The system\nof postal money orders began in 1864. Free mail delivery began in the larger\ncities in 1863.[16]\n\n### 19th\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 19th century\")]\n\nThe postal system played a crucial role in national expansion. It facilitated\n[expansion into the West](/wiki/American_frontier \"American frontier\") by\ncreating an inexpensive, fast, convenient communication system. Letters from\nearly settlers provided information and boosterism to encourage increased\nmigration to the West, helped scattered families stay in touch and provide\nassistance, assisted entrepreneurs in finding business opportunities, and made\npossible regular commercial relationships between merchants in the west and\nwholesalers and factories back east. The postal service likewise assisted the\nArmy in expanding control over the vast western territories. The widespread\ncirculation of important newspapers by mail, such as the _New York Weekly\nTribune,_ facilitated coordination among politicians in different states. The\npostal service helped integrate established areas with the frontier, creating\na spirit of nationalism and providing a necessary infrastructure.[17]\n\nThe Post Office in the 19th century was a major source of federal patronage.\nLocal postmasterships were rewards for local politicians—often the editors of\nparty newspapers. About three quarters of all federal civilian employees\nworked for the Post Office. In 1816 it employed 3341 men, and in 1841, 14,290.\nThe volume of mail expanded much faster than the population, as it carried\nannually 100 letters and 200 newspapers per 1000 white population in 1790, and\n2900 letters and 2700 newspapers per thousand in 1840.[18]\n\nThe Post Office Department was enlarged during the tenure of President [Andrew\nJackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\"). As the Post Office expanded,\ndifficulties were experienced due to a lack of employees and transportation.\nThe Post Office's employees at that time were still subject to the so-called\n\"spoils\" system, where faithful political supporters of the executive branch\nwere appointed to positions in the post office and other government\ncorporations as a reward for their patronage. These appointees rarely had\nprior experience in postal service and mail delivery. This system of political\npatronage was replaced in 1883, after passage of the [Pendleton Civil Service\nReform Act](/wiki/Pendleton_Civil_Service_Reform_Act \"Pendleton Civil Service\nReform Act\").[19]\n\nIn 1823, ten years after the Post Office had first begun to use steamboats to\ncarry mail between post towns where no roads existed, waterways were declared\npost roads.[20] Once it became clear that the postal system in the United\nStates needed to expand across the entire country, the use of the railroad to\ntransport the mail was instituted in 1832, on one line in Pennsylvania.[21]\nAll railroads in the United States were designated as post routes, after\npassage of the Act of July 7, 1838. Mail service by railroad increased rapidly\nthereafter.[22]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/First_US_Stamps_1847_Issue.jpg/220px-\nFirst_US_Stamps_1847_Issue.jpg)](/wiki/File:First_US_Stamps_1847_Issue.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:First_US_Stamps_1847_Issue.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_~[Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\") ~ [George\nWashington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\") ~_The First U.S.\nPostage StampsIssued 1847The first stamp issues were authorized by an act of\nCongress and approved on March 3, 1847.[23] The earliest known use of the\nFranklin 5¢ is July 7, 1847, while the earliest known use of the Washington\n10¢ is July 2, 1847. Remaining in postal circulation for only a few years,\nthese issues were declared invalid for postage on July 1, 1851.[24]\n\nAn Act of Congress provided for the issuance of stamps on March 3, 1847, and\nthe Postmaster General immediately let a contract to the New York City\nengraving firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch, and Edson. The first stamp issue of\nthe U.S. was offered for sale on July 1, 1847, in New York City, with Boston\nreceiving stamps the following day and other cities thereafter. The 5-cent\nstamp paid for a letter weighing less than 1 oz (28 g) and traveling less than\n300 miles, the 10-cent stamp for deliveries to locations greater than 300\nmiles, or twice the weight deliverable for the 5-cent stamp.\n\nIn 1847, the [U.S. Mail Steamship Company](/wiki/U.S._Mail_Steamship_Company\n\"U.S. Mail Steamship Company\") acquired the contract which allowed it to carry\nthe U.S. mails from New York, with stops in New Orleans and\n[Havana](/wiki/Havana \"Havana\"), to the [Isthmus of\nPanama](/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama \"Isthmus of Panama\") for delivery in\nCalifornia. The same year, the [Pacific Mail Steamship\nCompany](/wiki/Pacific_Mail_Steamship_Company \"Pacific Mail Steamship\nCompany\") had acquired the right to transport mail under contract from the\nUnited States Government from the Isthmus of Panama to California. In 1855,\n[William Henry Aspinwall](/wiki/William_Henry_Aspinwall \"William Henry\nAspinwall\") completed the [Panama Railway](/wiki/Panama_Canal_Railway \"Panama\nCanal Railway\"), providing rail service across the Isthmus and cutting to\nthree weeks the transport time for the mails, passengers and goods to\nCalifornia. This remained an important route until the completion of the\n[transcontinental railroad](/wiki/First_Transcontinental_Railroad \"First\nTranscontinental Railroad\") in 1869. Railroad companies greatly expanded mail\ntransport service after 1862, and the [Railway Mail\nService](/wiki/Railway_Mail_Service \"Railway Mail Service\") was inaugurated in\n1869.[21]\n\nRail cars designed to sort and distribute mail while rolling were soon\nintroduced.[21] RMS employees sorted mail \"on-the-fly\" during the journey, and\nbecame some of the most skilled workers in the postal service. An RMS sorter\nhad to be able to separate the mail quickly into compartments based on its\nfinal destination, before the first destination arrived, and work at the rate\nof 600 pieces of mail an hour. They were tested regularly for speed and\naccuracy.[25]\n\n[Parcel Post](/wiki/Parcel_Post \"Parcel Post\") service began with the\nintroduction of International Parcel Post between the USA and foreign\ncountries in 1887.[26] That same year, the [U.S. Post\nOffice](/wiki/United_States_Post_Office_Department \"United States Post Office\nDepartment\") (predecessor of the USPS) and the [Postmaster General of\nCanada](/wiki/Postmaster_General_of_Canada \"Postmaster General of Canada\")\nestablished parcel-post service between the two nations.[26] A bilateral\nparcel-post treaty between the independent (at the time) [Kingdom of\nHawaii](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hawaii \"Kingdom of Hawaii\") and the USA was signed on\n19 December 1888 and put into effect early in 1889.[27] Parcel-post service\nbetween the USA and other countries grew with the signing of successive postal\nconventions and treaties. While the Post Office agreed to deliver parcels sent\ninto the country under the UPU treaty, it did not institute a domestic parcel-\npost service for another twenty-five years.[28]\n\n### 20th\ncentury[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 20th century\")]\n\nThe advent of [Rural Free Delivery](/wiki/Rural_Free_Delivery \"Rural Free\nDelivery\") (RFD) in the U.S. in 1896, and the inauguration of a domestic\n[parcel post](/wiki/Parcel_post \"Parcel post\") service by [Postmaster\nGeneral](/wiki/United_States_Postmaster_General \"United States Postmaster\nGeneral\") [Frank H. Hitchcock](/wiki/Frank_Harris_Hitchcock \"Frank Harris\nHitchcock\") in 1913, greatly increased the volume of mail shipped nationwide,\nand motivated the development of more efficient postal transportation\nsystems.[29] Many rural customers took advantage of inexpensive Parcel Post\nrates to order goods and products from businesses located hundreds of miles\naway in distant cities for delivery by mail.[30] From the 1910s to the 1960s,\nmany college students and others used parcel post to mail home dirty laundry,\nas doing so was less expensive than washing the clothes themselves.[31]\n\nAfter four-year-old [Charlotte May Pierstorff](/wiki/Charlotte_May_Pierstorff\n\"Charlotte May Pierstorff\") was mailed from her parents to her grandparents in\nIdaho in 1914, mailing of people was prohibited.[30] In 1917, the Post Office\nimposed a maximum daily mailable limit of two hundred pounds per customer per\nday after a business entrepreneur, W. H. Coltharp, used inexpensive parcel-\npost rates to ship more than eighty thousand masonry bricks some four hundred\nseven miles via horse-drawn wagon and train for the construction of a [bank\nbuilding in Vernal, Utah](/wiki/Vernal,_Utah#Notable_buildings \"Vernal,\nUtah\").[32][33]\n\nThe advent of parcel post also led to the growth of [mail\norder](/wiki/Mail_order \"Mail order\") businesses that substantially increased\n[rural](/wiki/Rural_area \"Rural area\") access to modern goods over what was\ntypically stocked in local [general stores](/wiki/General_store \"General\nstore\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Historic_Post_Office_in_Mineral_Wells%2C_Texas.JPG/220px-\nHistoric_Post_Office_in_Mineral_Wells%2C_Texas.JPG)](/wiki/File:Historic_Post_Office_in_Mineral_Wells,_Texas.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Historic_Post_Office_in_Mineral_Wells,_Texas.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nHistoric [Mineral Wells, Texas](/wiki/Mineral_Wells,_Texas \"Mineral Wells,\nTexas\") post office built between 1911 and 1913\n\nIn 1912, carrier service was announced for establishment in towns of second\nand third class with $100,000 appropriated by Congress.[34] From January 1,\n1911, until July 1, 1967, the United States Post Office Department operated\nthe [United States Postal Savings\nSystem](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Savings_System \"United States Postal\nSavings System\"). An Act of Congress of June 25, 1910, established the Postal\nSavings System in designated Post Offices, effective January 1, 1911. The\nlegislation aimed to get money out of hiding, attract the savings of\nimmigrants accustomed to the [postal savings\nsystem](/wiki/Postal_savings_system \"Postal savings system\") in their native\ncountries, provide safe depositories for people who had lost confidence in\nbanks, and furnish more convenient depositories for working people. The law\nestablishing the system directed the Post Office Department to redeposit most\nof the money in the system in local banks, where it earned 2.5 percent\ninterest.\n\nThe system paid 2% interest per year on deposits. The half-percent difference\nin interest was intended to pay for the operation of the system. Certificates\nwere issued to depositors as proof of their deposit. Depositors in the system\nwere initially limited to hold a balance of $500, but this was raised to\n$1,000 in 1916 and to $2,500 in 1918. The initial minimum deposit was $1. In\norder to save smaller amounts for deposit, customers could purchase a 10-cent\npostal savings card and 10-cent postal savings stamps to fill it.

One of Lipsner's first acts was to hire four pilots, each with at\nleast 1,000 hours' flying experience, paying them an average of $4,000 per\nyear ($65.1 thousand today). The Post Office Department used new [Standard\nJR-1B biplanes](/wiki/Standard_J \"Standard J\") specially modified to carry the\nmail while the war was still in progress, but following the war operated\nmostly World War I surplus military [de Havilland DH-4](/wiki/Airco_DH.4\n\"Airco DH.4\") aircraft.[37]\n\nDuring 1918, the Post Office hired an additional 36 pilots. In its first year\nof operation, the Post Office completed 1,208 airmail flights with 90 forced\nlandings. Of those, 53 were due to weather and 37 to engine failure.

While other carriers may claim to\nvoluntarily provide delivery on a broad basis, the Postal Service is the only\ncarrier with a _legal obligation_ to provide all the various aspects of\nuniversal service.[95]\n\nProponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation\nmust be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the\npostal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it\nhas been in place for over a hundred years. It consists of two parts: the\n[Private Express Statutes](/wiki/Private_Express_Statutes \"Private Express\nStatutes\") (PES) and the mailbox access rule. The PES refers to the Postal\nService's monopoly on the delivery of letters, and the mailbox rule refers to\nthe Postal Service's exclusive access to customer mailboxes.[96]\n\nProponents of universal service principles further claim that eliminating or\nreducing the PES or mailbox rule would affect the ability of the Postal\nService to provide affordable universal service. If, for example, the PES and\nthe mailbox rule were to be eliminated, and the USO maintained, then either\nbillions of dollars in tax revenues or some other source of funding would have\nto be found.[97]\n\nSome proponents[_[by\nwhom?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] of universal service principles\nsuggest that private communications that are protected by the veil of\ngovernment promote the exchange of free ideas and communications. This\nseparates private communications from the ability of a private for-profit or\nnon-profit organization to corrupt. Security for the individual is in this way\nprotected by the United States Post Office, maintaining confidentiality and\nanonymity, as well as government employees being much less likely to be\ninstructed by superiors to engage in nefarious spying.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] It is\nseen by some[_[by\nwhom?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] as a dangerous step to extract\nthe universal service principle from the post office, as the untainted nature\nof private communications is preserved as assurance of the protection of\nindividual freedom of privacy.\n\nHowever, as the recent notice of a termination of mail service to residents of\nthe [Frank Church—River of No Return\nWilderness](/wiki/Frank_Church%E2%80%94River_of_No_Return_Wilderness \"Frank\nChurch—River of No Return Wilderness\") indicates, mail service has been\ncontracted to private firms such as Arnold Aviation for many decades. KTVB-TV\nreported:[98]\n\n> \"We cannot go out every week and pick up our mail ... it's impossible\", said\n> Heinz Sippel. \"Everyone gets their mail.

The report must include any\nrecommended changes. The Postal Service report supports the requirement that\nthe PRC is to consult with and solicit written comments from the Postal\nService. In addition, the Government Accountability Office is required to\nevaluate broader business model issues by 2011.\n\nOn October 15, 2008, the Postal Service submitted a report[100] to the PRC on\nits position related to the Universal Service Obligation (USO). It said no\nchanges to the USO and restriction on mailbox access were necessary at this\ntime, but increased regulatory flexibility was required to ensure affordable\nuniversal service in the future. In 2013, the Postal Service announced that\nstarting August 2013, Saturday delivery would be discontinued.\n\nObligations of the USO include uniform prices, quality of service, access to\nservices, and six-day delivery to every part of the country. To assure\nfinancial support for these obligations, the postal monopoly provides the\nPostal Service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox\naccess solely for mail. The report argued that eliminating or reducing either\naspect of the monopoly \"would have a devastating impact on the ability ... to\nprovide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly.\"\nRelaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns, increase\ndelivery costs, and hurt customer service, according to the Post Office. The\nreport notes:\n\n> It is somewhat misleading to characterize the mailbox rule as a \"monopoly,\"\n> because the enforcement of [18\n> U.S.C.](/wiki/Title_18_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 18 of the United\n> States Code\") [§ 1725](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1725)\n> leaves customers with ample alternative means of delivering their messages.\n> Customers can deliver their messages either by paying postage, by placing\n> messages on or under a door or a doormat, by using newspaper or non-postal\n> boxes, by telephoning or emailing, by engaging in person-to-person delivery\n> in public areas, by tacking or taping their notices on a door post, or by\n> placing advertisements in local newspapers. These methods are comparable in\n> efficacy to communication via the mailbox.\n\nMost of these alternatives are not actually free in some communities. For\nexample, in the [Chicago metropolitan area](/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area\n\"Chicago metropolitan area\") and many other [major metros](/wiki/Metropolis\n\"Metropolis\") one must get a background check from [police](/wiki/Police\n\"Police\") and pay a daily fee for the right to solicit or post\n[commercial](/wiki/Advertising \"Advertising\") messages on [private\nproperty](/wiki/Private_property \"Private property\").\n\nRegarding the monopoly on delivery of letters, the report notes that the\nmonopoly is not complete, as there is an exception for letters where either\n_the amount paid for private carriage of the letter equals at least six times\nthe current rate for the first ounce of a single-piece First-Class Mail letter\n(also known as the \"base rate\" or \"base tariff\")_ or _the letter weighs at\nleast 12.5 ounces._\n\nThe Postal Service said that the USO should continue to be broadly defined and\nthere should be no changes to the postal monopoly. Any changes would have far-\nreaching effects on customers and the trillion dollar mailing industry. \"A\nmore rigidly defined USO would ... ultimately harm the American public and\nbusinesses,\" according to the report, which cautions that any potential change\nmust be studied carefully and the effects fully understood.\n\n###\nCompetitors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Competitors\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/U.S._Post_Office_-\n_Los_Angeles_Terminal_Annex.jpg/220px-U.S._Post_Office_-\n_Los_Angeles_Terminal_Annex.jpg)](/wiki/File:U.S._Post_Office_-\n_Los_Angeles_Terminal_Annex.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:U.S._Post_Office_-_Los_Angeles_Terminal_Annex.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUSPS [Terminal Annex](/wiki/Terminal_Annex \"Terminal Annex\") building in Los\nAngeles\n\n[FedEx](/wiki/FedEx \"FedEx\") and [United Parcel\nService](/wiki/United_Parcel_Service \"United Parcel Service\") (UPS) directly\ncompete with USPS Express Mail and package delivery services, making\nnationwide deliveries of urgent letters and packages. Due to the postal\nmonopoly, they are not allowed to deliver non-urgent letters and may not\ndirectly ship to U.S. Mail boxes at residential and commercial destinations.\nHowever, both companies have transit agreements with the USPS in which an item\ncan be dropped off with either FedEx or UPS who will then provide shipment up\nto the destination post office serving the intended recipient where it will be\ntransferred for delivery to the U.S. Mail destination, including Post Office\nBox destinations.[101][102] These services also deliver packages which are\nlarger and heavier than USPS will accept. [DHL Express](/wiki/DHL_Express \"DHL\nExpress\") was the third major competitor until February 2009, when it ceased\ndomestic delivery operations in the United States.\n\nA variety of other [transportation companies in the United\nStates](/wiki/Category:Transportation_companies_of_the_United_States\n\"Category:Transportation companies of the United States\") move cargo around\nthe country, but either have limited geographic scope for delivery points, or\nspecialize in items too large to be mailed. Many of the thousands of\n[courier](/wiki/Courier \"Courier\") companies focus on same-day delivery, for\nexample, by [bicycle messenger](/wiki/Bicycle_messenger \"Bicycle messenger\").\n\nAlthough USPS and FedEx are direct competitors, USPS contracts with FedEx for\nair transport of 2–3 Day Priority Mail [103] and Priority Mail Express\n(typically delivered overnight).[104]\n\n### Alternative transmission\nmethods[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Alternative transmission methods\")]\n\nThe Post Office Department owned and operated the first public\n[telegraph](/wiki/Telegraph \"Telegraph\") lines in the United States, starting\nin 1844 from Washington to Baltimore, and eventually extending to New York,\nBoston, Buffalo, and Philadelphia. In 1847, the telegraph system was\nprivatized, except for a period during World War I, when it was used to\naccelerate the delivery of letters arriving at night.[105]\n\nBetween 1942 and 1945, \"[V-Mail](/wiki/V-Mail \"V-Mail\")\" (for \"Victory Mail\")\nservice was available for [military mail](/wiki/Military_mail \"Military\nmail\"). Letters were converted into [microfilm](/wiki/Microfilm \"Microfilm\")\nand reprinted near the destination, to save room on transport vehicles for\nmilitary cargo.[106]\n\nFrom 1982 to 1985, Electronic Computer Originated Mail, known as\n[E-COM](/wiki/E-COM \"E-COM\") was accepted for bulk mailings. Text was\ntransmitted electronically to one of 25 post offices nationwide. The Postal\nService would print the mail and put it in special envelopes bearing a blue\nE-COM logo. Delivery was assured within 2 days.[107]\n\nTo improve accuracy and efficiency, the Postal Service introduced the\n[Intelligent Mail program](/wiki/Intelligent_Mail_barcode \"Intelligent Mail\nbarcode\") to complement the ZIP code system. This system, which was intended\nto replace the depreciated [POSTNET](/wiki/POSTNET \"POSTNET\") system, allows\nbulk mailers to use pre-printed bar codes to assist in mail delivery and\nsorting. Additional features, called Enhanced, or Full-Service, Intelligent\nMail Barcodes allow for mail tracking of bulk mail through the postal system\nup to the final delivery Post Office.[108]\n\n### Criticism of the universal service requirement and the postal\nmonopoly[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Criticism of the universal service requirement and the postal\nmonopoly\")]\n\nCritics of the universal service requirement and the statutory postal monopoly\ninclude several professional economists advocating for the privatization of\nthe mail delivery system, or at least a relaxation of the universal service\nmodel that currently exists.[109] Rick Geddes argued in 2000:[110]\n\n>   * First, basic economics implies that rural customers are unlikely to be\n> without service under competition; they would simply have to pay the true\n> cost of delivery to them, which may or may not be lower than under monopoly.\n>   * Second, basic notions of fairness imply that the cross-subsidy should be\n> eliminated. To the extent that people make choices about where they live,\n> they should assume the costs of that decision.\n>   * Third, there is no reason why the government monopoly is necessary to\n> ensure service to sparsely populated areas. The government could easily\n> award competitive contracts to private firms for that service.\n>   * Fourth, early concerns that rural residents of the United States would\n> somehow become isolated without federally subsidized mail delivery today are\n> simply unfounded. ... Once both sender and receiver have access to a\n> computer, the marginal cost of sending an electronic message is close to\n> zero.\n>\n\nFurthermore, some economists have argued that because public enterprises may\npursue objectives different than profit maximization, they might have more of\nan incentive than profit-maximizing firms to behave anticompetitively through\npolicies such as predatory pricing, misstating costs, and creating barriers to\nentry.[111] To resolve those issues, one economist proposes a cost-allocation\nmodel that would determine the optimal allocation of USPS's [common\ncosts](/wiki/Fixed_cost \"Fixed cost\") by finding the share of costs that would\nmaximize USPS profits from its competitive products.[112] Postal regulators\ncould use such a cost model to ensure that the Postal Service is not abusing\nits statutory monopoly by subsidizing price cuts in competitive product\nmarkets with revenue obtained from the monopolized market.[113]\n\n## Law enforcement\nagencies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Law enforcement agencies\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/FDA_and_the_International_Mail_Facilities_%28IMFs%29_%2827057043228%29.jpg/220px-\nFDA_and_the_International_Mail_Facilities_%28IMFs%29_%2827057043228%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:FDA_and_the_International_Mail_Facilities_\\(IMFs\\)_\\(27057043228\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FDA_and_the_International_Mail_Facilities_\\(IMFs\\)_\\(27057043228\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration \"Food\nand Drug Administration\") inspects packages for illegal drug shipments\n\n### Postal Inspection\nService[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Postal Inspection Service\")]\n\nThe [United States Postal Inspection\nService](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Inspection_Service \"United States Postal\nInspection Service\") (USPIS) is one of the oldest [law enforcement\nagencies](/wiki/Law_enforcement_agencies \"Law enforcement agencies\") in the\nU.S. Founded by [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin\nFranklin\"), its mission is to protect the Postal Service, its employees, and\nits customers from crime and protect the nation's mail system from criminal\nmisuse.[114]\n\nPostal Inspectors enforce over 200 federal laws providing for the protection\nof mail in [investigations of crimes](/wiki/Criminal_procedure \"Criminal\nprocedure\") that may adversely affect or fraudulently use the U.S. Mail, the\npostal system or postal employees.\n\nThe USPIS has the power to enforce the USPS monopoly by conducting search and\nseizure raids on entities they suspect of sending non-urgent mail through\novernight delivery competitors. According to the [American Enterprise\nInstitute](/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute \"American Enterprise\nInstitute\"), a private conservative [think tank](/wiki/Think_tank \"Think\ntank\"), the USPIS raided [Equifax](/wiki/Equifax \"Equifax\") offices in 1993 to\nascertain if the mail they were sending through [Federal Express](/wiki/FedEx\n\"FedEx\") was truly \"extremely urgent.\" It was found that the mail was not, and\nEquifax was fined $30,000.[115][116]\n\nLastly, the PIS oversees the activities of the [Postal Police\nForce](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Inspection_Service#Police_Force \"United\nStates Postal Inspection Service\") who patrol in and around selected high-risk\npostal facilities in major metropolitan areas in the United States and its\nterritories.\n\n### Office of Inspector\nGeneral[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Office of Inspector General\")]\n\nThe [United States Postal Service Office of Inspector\nGeneral](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service_Office_of_Inspector_General\n\"United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General\") (OIG) was\nauthorized by law in 1996. Prior to the 1996 legislation, the Postal\nInspection Service performed the duties of the OIG. The Inspector General, who\nis independent of postal management, is appointed by and reports directly to\nthe nine [presidentially\nappointed](/wiki/List_of_positions_filled_by_presidential_appointment_with_Senate_confirmation\n\"List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate\nconfirmation\"), [Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States\nSenate\")–[confirmed](/wiki/Advice_and_consent \"Advice and consent\") members of\nthe [Board of Governors of the United States Postal\nService](/wiki/Board_of_Governors_of_the_United_States_Postal_Service \"Board\nof Governors of the United States Postal Service\").\n\nThe primary purpose of the OIG is to prevent, detect and report fraud, waste\nand program abuse, and promote efficiency in the operations of the Postal\nService.

More precisely, on a letter-size piece, the recommended address placement is within the optical character reader (OCR) read area, which is a space on the address side of the mailpiece defined by these boundaries: Left – 1/2 inch (13 mm) from the left edge of the piece; Right – 1/2 inch (13 mm) from the right edge of the piece; Top – 2-3/4 inches (70 mm) from the bottom edge of the piece; Bottom – 5/8 inch (16 mm) from the bottom edge of the piece.[120] Preferred placement of a return address is in the upper left portion of the mailpiece—on the side of the piece bearing postage.[121] Finally, postage (e.g., stamps, meter imprints, information-based indicia [IBI], etc.) is to be affixed in the upper right corner of the address side of the mail cover. It should be noted that any stamp/indicia partly concealed or otherwise obscured by an overlapping stamp/indicia may not be counted as valid postage.[122]\n  2. **Delivery Address (party receiving mail)** : The mail piece must have the address of the intended recipient, visible and legible, only on the side of the mail piece bearing postage. Generally, the name of the addressee should be included above the [address](/wiki/Address_\\(geography\\) \"Address \\(geography\\)\") itself. A [ZIP+4 code](/wiki/ZIP%2B4_code \"ZIP+4 code\") will facilitate delivery.[123]\n  3. **Return Address (party sending mail)** : A return address tells the USPS where the sender wants the mail returned if it is undeliverable. Usage of a return address is required for some postal services (including Priority Mail, Express Mail, Periodicals in envelopes or wrappers, Insured Mail, Registered Mail, and parcel services).[124]\n  4. **Postage Payment** : All mailpieces must include appropriate valid postage. Postage payment may be in the form of stamps, stamped stationery, precanceled stamps, postage meter imprints & PC Postage products (\"Postage Evidencing Systems\"), or permit imprint (indicia).[125] Members of the U.S. Congress, among others, have [franking privileges](/wiki/Franking \"Franking\"), which require only a signature.\n\nDomestic First-Class Mail costs 50¢ for [envelopes](/wiki/Envelope \"Envelope\")\n(35¢ for [post cards](/wiki/Postcard \"Postcard\")) and upwards, depending on\nthe weight and dimensions of the letter and the class.\n\nMail going to naval vessels is known as the [Fleet Post\nOffice](/wiki/Military_mail \"Military mail\") (FPO) and to Army or Air Force\ninstallations use the city abbreviation APO (Army Post Office or Air Force\nPost Office).\n\nUndeliverable mail that could not be readily returned, including mail without\na return address, is treated as [dead mail](/wiki/Dead_mail \"Dead mail\") at a\nMail Recovery Center in [Atlanta, Georgia](/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia \"Atlanta,\nGeorgia\") or [Saint Paul, Minnesota](/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota \"Saint Paul,\nMinnesota\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/UseZipCode.JPG/220px-\nUseZipCode.JPG)](/wiki/File:UseZipCode.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:UseZipCode.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nSticker promoting ZIP code use\n\nThe format of the address is as follows\n\n    \n    Line 1: Name of recipient\n    Line 2: Street address or [P.O.

Though some [style\nmanuals](/wiki/Style_manual \"Style manual\") recommend using a comma between\nthe city and state name when typesetting addresses in other contexts, for\noptimal automatic character recognition, the Post Office does not recommend\nthis when addressing mail. The official recommendation is to use all upper\ncase block letters with proper formats and abbreviations, and leave out all\npunctuation except for the [hyphen](/wiki/Hyphen \"Hyphen\") in the ZIP+4 code.\nIf the address is unusually formatted or illegible enough, it will require\nhand-processing, delaying that particular item. The USPS publishes the\nentirety of their postal addressing standards.[127]\n\n[Postal address verification](/wiki/Postal_address_verification \"Postal\naddress verification\") tools and services are offered by the USPS and third\nparty companies to help ensure mail is deliverable by fixing formatting,\nappending information such as ZIP code and validating the address is a valid\n[delivery point](/wiki/Postal_address_verification#Delivery_Point_Validation\n\"Postal address verification\").

In a DPV process, the address is checked against the AMS data file\nto ensure that it exists as an active delivery point.[129] The USPS does not\noffer DPV validation on their website; however, there are companies that offer\nservices to perform DPV verification.\n\n### Paying\npostage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Paying postage\")]\n\nThe actual postage can be paid via:[130]\n\n  * Stamps purchased online at usps.com, at a Post Office, from a stamp vending machine or \"Automated Postal Center\" which can also handle packages, or from a third party (such as a grocery store)\n  * [Pre-cancelled stamps](/wiki/Pre-cancelled_stamps \"Pre-cancelled stamps\") for bulk mailings[131]\n  * Postal meter\n  * Prepaid envelope\n  * Shipping label purchased online and printed by the customer on standard paper (e.g. with [Click-N-Ship](/wiki/Click-N-Ship \"Click-N-Ship\"), or via a third-party such as [PayPal](/wiki/PayPal \"PayPal\") or [Amazon shipping](/wiki/Amazon.com \"Amazon.com\"))\n\nAll unused [U.S. postage stamps](/wiki/U.S._postage_stamps \"U.S. postage\nstamps\") issued since 1861 are still valid as postage at their indicated\nvalue. Stamps with no value shown or denominated by a letter are also still\nvalid, although the value depends upon the particular stamp. For some stamps\nissued without a printed value, the current value is the original value. But\nsome stamps beginning in 1988 or earlier, including _Forever Stamps_ (issued\nfrom April 2007) and all first-class, first-ounce stamps issued from January\n21, 2011, the value is the current value of a first-class-mail first-ounce\nstamp. The USPS calls these Forever Stamps but the generic name is [non-\ndenominated postage](/wiki/Non-denominated_postage \"Non-denominated postage\").\n\nForever stamps are sold at the First-Class Mail postage rate at the time of\npurchase, but will always be valid for First-Class Mail (1 oz and under), no\nmatter how rates rise in the future.[132][133] Britain has had a similar stamp\nsince 1989. The cost of mailing a 1 oz (28 g) First-Class letter increased to\n50 cents on 28 January 2018[134]\n\n#### Postage\nmeters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Postage meters\")]\n\nMain article: [Postage meter](/wiki/Postage_meter \"Postage meter\")\n\nA postage meter is a mechanical device used to create and apply physical\nevidence of postage (or franking) to mailed matter. Postage meters are\nregulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States,\nthe United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation,\nsupport, and use of postage meters. A postage meter imprints an amount of\npostage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark\nall in one. The meter stamp serves as proof of payment and eliminates the need\nfor adhesive stamps.\n\n#### PC\npostage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: PC postage\")]\n\nIn addition to using standard stamps, postage can now be printed in the form\nof an electronic stamp, or e-stamp, from a personal computer using a system\ncalled [Information Based Indicia](/wiki/Information_Based_Indicia\n\"Information Based Indicia\"). This online PC Postage method relies upon\napplication software on the customer's computer contacting a postal security\ndevice at the office of the postal service.[135]\n\n### Other electronic postage payment\nmethods[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Other electronic postage payment methods\")]\n\nElectronic Verification System (eVS)[136] is the Postal Service's integrated\nmail management technology that centralizes payment processing and electronic\npostage reports. Part of an evolving suite of USPS electronic payment services\ncalled PostalOne!,[137] eVS allows mailers shipping large volumes of parcels\nthrough the Postal Service a way to circumvent use of hard-copy manifests,\npostage statements and drop-shipment verification forms. Instead, mailers can\npay postage automatically through a centralized account and track payments\nonline.\n\nBeginning in August 2007, the Postal Service began requiring mailers shipping\nParcel Select packages using a permit imprint to use eVS for manifesting their\npackages.\n\n#### Stamp copyright and\nreproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Stamp copyright and reproduction\")]\n\nAll U.S. postage stamps issued under the former [United States Post Office\nDepartment](/wiki/United_States_Post_Office_Department \"United States Post\nOffice Department\") and other postage items that were released before 1978 are\nnot subject to copyright, but stamp designs since 1978 are copyrighted.[138]\nThe [United States Copyright Office](/wiki/United_States_Copyright_Office\n\"United States Copyright Office\") in section 313.6(C)(1) of the Third Edition\nof the [Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office\nPractices](/wiki/Compendium_of_U.S._Copyright_Office_Practices \"Compendium of\nU.S. Copyright Office Practices\") holds that \"Works prepared by officers or\nemployees of the U.S. Postal Service ... are not considered works of the U.S.\nGovernment\"[139] and are therefore eligible for registration.

Formerly, USPS International services[146]\nwere categorized as Airmail (Letter Post), Economy (Surface) Parcel Post,\nAirmail Parcel Post, Global Priority, Global Express, and Global Express\nGuaranteed Mail. The former Airmail (Letter Post) is now First-Class Mail\nInternational,[147][148] and includes small packages weighing up to four\npounds (1.8 kg). Economy Parcel Post was discontinued for international\nservice, while Airmail Parcel Post was replaced by Priority Mail\nInternational. Priority Mail International Flat-Rate packaging in various\nsizes was introduced, with the same conditions of service previously used for\nGlobal Priority. Global Express is now Express Mail International, while\nGlobal Express Guaranteed is unchanged. The international mailing classes with\na tracking ability are Express, Express Guaranteed, and Priority (except that\ntracking is not available for Priority Mail International Flat Rate Envelopes\nor Priority Mail International Small Flat Rate Boxes).[149]\n\nOne of the major changes in the new naming and services definitions is that\nUSPS-supplied mailing boxes for Priority and Express mail are now allowed for\ninternational use. These services are offered to ship letters and packages to\nalmost every country and territory on the globe. The USPS provides much of\nthis service by contracting with a private parcel service, [FedEx](/wiki/FedEx\n\"FedEx\").[150]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/M-bag_Asendia.jpg/170px-\nM-bag_Asendia.jpg)](/wiki/File:M-bag_Asendia.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:M-bag_Asendia.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn m-bag\n\nThe USPS provides an **M-bag**[151] service for international shipment of\n[printed matter](/wiki/Printed_matter \"Printed matter\");[152] previously\nsurface M-bags existed, but with the 2007 elimination of surface mail, only\nairmail M-bags remain.[153] The term \"M-bag\" is not expanded in USPS\npublications; M-bags are simply defined as \"direct sacks of printed matter ...\nsent to a single foreign addressee at a single address\";[152] however, the\nterm is sometimes referred to informally as \"media bag\", as the bag can also\ncontain \"discs, tapes, and cassettes\", in addition to books, for which the\nusual umbrella term is \"media\"; some also refer to them as \"mail bags\".\n\n[Military mail](/wiki/Military_mail \"Military mail\") is billed at domestic\nrates when being sent from the United States to a military outpost, and is\nfree when sent by deployed military personnel. The overseas logistics are\nhandled by the [Military Postal Service\nAgency](/wiki/Military_Postal_Service_Agency \"Military Postal Service Agency\")\nin the Department of Defense.[154] Outside of forward areas and active\noperations, military mail First-Class takes 7–10 days, Priority 10–15 days,\nand Parcel Post about 24 days.[141]\n\nThree independent countries with a [Compact of Free\nAssociation](/wiki/Compact_of_Free_Association \"Compact of Free Association\")\nwith the U.S. ([Palau](/wiki/Palau \"Palau\"), the [Marshall\nIslands](/wiki/Marshall_Islands \"Marshall Islands\"), and the [Federated States\nof Micronesia](/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia \"Federated States of\nMicronesia\")) have a special relationship with the United States Postal\nService:\n\n  * Each associated state maintains its own government-run mail service for delivery to and pickup from retail customers.[155][156][157]\n  * The associated states are integrated into the USPS addressing and ZIP code system.\n  * The USPS is responsible for transporting mail between the United States and the associated states,[155] and between the individual states of the Federated States of Micronesia.[157]\n  * The associated states synchronize postal services and rates with the USPS.\n  * The USPS treats mail to and from the associated states as domestic mail, (as of November 19, 2007, after a 23-month period of being treated as international mail).[158] Incoming mail does require customs declarations because, like some U.S. territories, the associated states are outside the main [customs territory of the United States](/wiki/Customs_territory_of_the_United_States \"Customs territory of the United States\").[159]\n\n#### The discontinuation of international surface\nmail[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=41\n\"Edit section: The discontinuation of international surface mail\")]\n\nFor more information about surface mail, see [Surface mail](/wiki/Surface_mail\n\"Surface mail\").\n\nIn 2007, the US Postal Service discontinued its outbound international surface\nmail (\"sea mail\") service,[160] mainly because of increased costs. Returned\nundeliverable surface parcels had become an expensive problem for the\nUSPS.[161] The discontinuation has been criticized by independent booksellers,\nby other small businesses which ship internationally, by the Peace Corps, and\nby military personnel. Domestic surface mail (now \"Retail Ground\" or\n\"Commercial Parcel Select\") remains available.\n\nAlternatives to international surface mail include:\n\n  * [International Surface Air Lift](/wiki/Surface_Air_Lifted \"Surface Air Lifted\").

Mail from individual customers and\npublic postboxes is collected by mail carriers into plastic tubs, which are\ntaken to one of approximately 251 **Processing and Distribution Centers** (**P\n&DC**) across the United States. Each P&DC sorts mail for a given region\n(typically with a radius of around 200 miles (320 km)) and connects with the\nnational network for interregional mail.[163] The USPS has consolidated mail\nsorting for large regions into the P&DCs on the basis that most mail is\naddressed to faraway destinations,[164] but for cities at the edge of a P&DC's\nregion, this means all locally addressed mail must now travel long distances\n(that is, to and from the P&DC for sorting) to reach nearby addresses.[165]\n\nAt the P&DC, mail is emptied into hampers which are then automatically dumped\ninto a Dual Pass Rough Cull System (DPRCS). As mail travels through the DPRCS,\nlarge items, such as packages and mail bundles, are removed from the stream.\nAs the remaining mail enters the first machine for processing standard mail,\nthe [Advanced Facer-Canceler System](/wiki/Advanced_Facer-Canceler_System\n\"Advanced Facer-Canceler System\") (AFCS), pieces that passed through the DPRCS\nbut do not conform to physical dimensions for processing in the AFCS (e.g.,\nlarge envelopes or overstuffed standard envelopes) are automatically diverted\nfrom the stream. Mail removed from the DPRCS and AFCS is manually processed or\nsent to parcel sorting machines.\n\nIn contrast to the previous system, which merely canceled and postmarked the\nupper right corner of the envelope, thereby missing any stamps which were\ninappropriately placed, the Advanced Facer-Canceler System locates\n[indicia](/wiki/Indicia_\\(philately\\) \"Indicia \\(philately\\)\") (stamp or\nmetered [postage](/wiki/Postage \"Postage\") mark), regardless of the\norientation of the mail as it enters the machine, and cancels it by applying a\n[postmark](/wiki/Postmark \"Postmark\"). Detection of indicia enables the AFCS\nto determine the orientation of each mailpiece and sort it accordingly,\nrotating pieces as necessary so all mail is sorted right-side up and faced in\nthe same direction in each output bin.\n\nMail is output by the machine into three categories: mail already affixed with\na [bar code](/wiki/Bar_code \"Bar code\") and addressed (such as business reply\nenvelopes and cards); mail with machine printed (typed) addresses; and mail\nwith handwritten addresses. Additionally, machines with a recent [Optical\nCharacter Recognition](/wiki/Optical_Character_Recognition \"Optical Character\nRecognition\") (OCR) upgrade have the capability to read the address\ninformation, including handwritten, and sort the mail based on local or\noutgoing ZIP codes.\n\nMail with typed addresses goes to a [Multiline Optical Character\nReader](/wiki/Multiline_Optical_Character_Reader \"Multiline Optical Character\nReader\") (MLOCR) which reads the ZIP Code and address information and prints\nthe appropriate bar code onto the envelope. Mail (actually the scanned image\nof the mail) with handwritten addresses (and machine-printed ones that are not\neasily recognized) goes to the [Remote Bar Coding\nSystem](/wiki/Remote_Bar_Coding_System \"Remote Bar Coding System\"). It also\ncorrects spelling errors and, where there is an error, omission, or conflict\nin the written address, identifies the most likely correct address.\n\nWhen it has decided on a correct address, it prints the appropriate bar code\nonto the envelopes, similarly to the MLOCR system. RBCS also has facilities in\nplace, called [Remote Encoding Centers](/wiki/Remote_Encoding_Center \"Remote\nEncoding Center\"), that have humans look at images of mail pieces and enter\nthe address data. The address data is associated with the image via an ID Tag,\na [fluorescent](/wiki/Fluorescent \"Fluorescent\") [barcode](/wiki/Barcode\n\"Barcode\") printed by mail processing equipment on the back of mail pieces.\n\nProcessed mail is imaged by the [Mail Isolation Control and\nTracking](/wiki/Mail_Isolation_Control_and_Tracking \"Mail Isolation Control\nand Tracking\") (MICT) system to allow easier tracking of hazardous substances.\nImages are taken at more than 200 mail processing centers, and are destroyed\nafter being retained for 30 days.[166]\n\nIf a customer has filed a change of address card and his or her mail is\ndetected in the mailstream with the old address, the mailpiece is sent to a\nmachine that automatically connects to a Computerized Forwarding System\ndatabase to determine the new address. If this address is found, the machine\nwill paste a label over the former address with the current address. The mail\nis returned to the mailstream to forward to the new location.\n\nMail with addresses that cannot be resolved by the automated system are\nseparated for human intervention. If a local postal worker can read the\naddress, he or she manually sorts it out according to the ZIP code on the\narticle. If the address cannot be read, mail is either returned to the sender\n(First-Class Mail with a valid return address) or is sent to the Mail Recovery\nCenter in Atlanta, Georgia (formerly known as the [dead letter\noffice](/wiki/Dead_letter_office \"Dead letter office\")). At this office, the\nmail is opened to try to find an address to forward to. If an address is\nfound, the contents are resealed and delivered. Otherwise, the items are held\nfor 90 days in case of inquiry by the customer; if they are not claimed, they\nare either destroyed or auctioned off at the monthly Postal Service Unclaimed\nParcel auction to raise money for the service.\n\nOnce the mail is bar coded, it is automatically sorted by a [Delivery Bar Code\nSorter](/wiki/Delivery_bar_code_sorter \"Delivery bar code sorter\") (DBCS) that\nreads the bar code, identifies the destination of the mailpiece, and sends it\nto an appropriate tray that corresponds to the next segment of its journey.\n\nRegional mail is either trucked to the appropriate local post office, or kept\nin the building for carrier routes served directly from the P&DC. Out-of-\nregion mail is trucked to the airport and then flown, usually as baggage on\ncommercial airlines, to the airport nearest the destination station. At the\ndestination P&DC, mail is once again read by a DBCS which sorts items to local\npost offices; this includes grouping mailpieces by individual mail carrier.\n\nAt the carrier route level, 95% of letters arrive pre-sorted;[163] the\nremaining mail must be sorted by hand. The Post Office is working to increase\nthe percentage of automatically sorted mail, including a pilot program to sort\n\"flats\".[167]\n\nFedEx provides air transport service to USPS for Priority and Express Mail.\nPriority Mail and Express Mail are transported from Priority Mail processing\ncenters to the closest FedEx-served airport, where they are handed off to\nFedEx. FedEx then flies them to the destination airport and hands them back to\nUSPS for transport to the local post office and delivery.\n\n#### Types of postal\nfacilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: Types of postal facilities\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/OldPostOfficeTomahWI.JPG/220px-\nOldPostOfficeTomahWI.JPG)](/wiki/File:OldPostOfficeTomahWI.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:OldPostOfficeTomahWI.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nHistoric main post office in [Tomah, Wisconsin](/wiki/Tomah,_Wisconsin \"Tomah,\nWisconsin\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/LongPointStationHouston.JPG/220px-\nLongPointStationHouston.JPG)](/wiki/File:LongPointStationHouston.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:LongPointStationHouston.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA typical post office station in the [Spring\nBranch](/wiki/Spring_Branch,_Houston \"Spring Branch, Houston\") area of\n[Houston](/wiki/Houston \"Houston\"), Texas\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Galveston_Federal_Building_2009.jpg/220px-\nGalveston_Federal_Building_2009.jpg)](/wiki/File:Galveston_Federal_Building_2009.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Galveston_Federal_Building_2009.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA combined [Post Office, Customs House, and Federal Court\nHouse](/wiki/Galveston_United_States_Post_Office_and_Courthouse \"Galveston\nUnited States Post Office and Courthouse\") in [Galveston,\nTexas](/wiki/Galveston,_Texas \"Galveston, Texas\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Halibut_Cove_Post_Office.jpg/220px-\nHalibut_Cove_Post_Office.jpg)](/wiki/File:Halibut_Cove_Post_Office.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Halibut_Cove_Post_Office.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFloating post office, [Halibut Cove, Alaska](/wiki/Halibut_Cove,_Alaska\n\"Halibut Cove, Alaska\")\n\nAlthough its customer service centers are called post offices in regular\nspeech, the USPS recognizes several types of postal facilities, including the\nfollowing:\n\n  * A **main post office** (formerly known as a **general post office**) is the primary postal facility in a community.\n  * A **station** or **post office station** is a postal facility that is not the main post office, but that is within the corporate limits of the community.\n  * A **branch** or **post office branch** is a postal facility that is not the main post office and that is outside the corporate limits of the community.\n  * A **classified unit** is a station or branch operated by USPS employees in a facility owned or leased by the USPS.\n  * A **contract postal unit** (or **CPU**) is a station or branch operated by a contractor, typically in a store or other place of business.[168]\n  * A **community post office** (or **CPO**) is a contract postal unit providing services in a small community in which other types of post office facilities have been discontinued.\n  * A **finance unit** is a station or branch that provides window services and accepts mail, but does not provide delivery.\n  * A **village post office** (**VPO**) is an entity such as a local business or government center that provides postal services through a contract with the USPS.

In 1828, local religious\nleaders noticed a decline in Sunday-morning church attendance because of local\npost offices' doubling as gathering places. These leaders appealed to the\ngovernment to intervene and close post offices on Sundays. The government,\nhowever, declined, and mail was delivered 7 days a week until 1912.[183][184]\n\nToday, U.S. Mail (with the exception of Express Mail)[185] is not delivered on\nSunday.\n\nSaturday delivery was temporarily suspended in April 1957, because of lack of\nfunds, but quickly restored.[186][187]\n\nBudget problems prompted consideration of dropping Saturday delivery starting\naround 2009. This culminated in a 2013 announcement that regular mail services\nwould be cut to five days a week, which was reversed by Congress before it\ncould take effect. (See the section Revenue decline and planned cuts.)\n\n#### Direct delivery vs. customer\npickup[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=50\n\"Edit section: Direct delivery vs. customer pickup\")]\n\nOriginally, mail was not delivered to homes and businesses, but to post\noffices. In 1863, \"city delivery\" began in urban areas with enough customers\nto make this economical. This required streets to be named, houses to be\nnumbered, with sidewalks and lighting provided, and these street addresses to\nbe added to envelopes.[188] The number of routes served expanded over time. In\n1891, the first experiments with [Rural Free\nDelivery](/wiki/Rural_Free_Delivery \"Rural Free Delivery\") began in less\ndensely populated areas. There is currently an effort to reduce direct\ndelivery in favor of mailbox clusters.\n\nTo compensate for high mail volume and slow long-distance transportation which\nsaw mail arrive at post offices throughout the day, deliveries were made\nmultiple times a day. This ranged from twice for residential areas to up to\nseven times for the central business district of [Brooklyn](/wiki/Brooklyn\n\"Brooklyn\"), New York.[189] In the late 19th century, mail boxes were\nencouraged, saving carriers the time it took to deliver directly to the\naddressee in person; in the 1910s and 1920s, they were phased in as a\nrequirement for service.[188] In the 1940s, multiple daily deliveries began to\nbe reduced, especially on Saturdays. By 1990, the last twice-daily deliveries\nin New York City were eliminated.\n\nToday, mail is delivered once a day on-site to most private homes and\nbusinesses. The USPS still distinguishes between city delivery (where carriers\ngenerally walk and deliver to mailboxes hung on exterior walls or porches, or\nto commercial reception areas) and rural delivery (where carriers generally\ndrive).[190] With \"curbside delivery\", mailboxes are at the ends of driveways,\non the nearest convenient road. \"Central point delivery\" is used in some\nlocations, where several nearby residences share a \"cluster\" of individual\nmailboxes in a single housing.\n\nSome customers choose to use [post office boxes](/wiki/Post_office_box \"Post\noffice box\") for an additional fee, for privacy or convenience. This provides\na locked box at the post office to which mail is addressed and delivered\n(usually earlier in the day than home delivery). Customers in less densely\npopulated areas where there is no city delivery and who do not qualify for\nrural delivery may receive mail only through post office boxes. High-volume\nbusiness customers can also arrange for special pick-up.[191][192]\n\nAnother option is the old-style [general delivery](/wiki/General_delivery\n\"General delivery\"), for people who have neither post office boxes nor street\naddresses. Mail is held at the post office until they present identification\nand pick it up.\n\nSome customers receive free post office boxes if the USPS declines to provide\ndoor-to-door delivery to their location or a nearby box.[193] People with\nmedical problems can request door-to-door delivery.[194]\n[Homeless](/wiki/Homeless \"Homeless\") people are also eligible for post office\nboxes at the discretion of the local postmaster, or can use general\ndelivery.[195]\n\n#### Special\ndelivery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=51\n\"Edit section: Special delivery\")]\n\nFrom 1885 to 1997, a service called [special\ndelivery](/wiki/Special_delivery_\\(postal_service\\) \"Special delivery \\(postal\nservice\\)\") was available, which caused a separate delivery to the final\nlocation earlier in the day than the usual daily rounds.\n\n#### Same-day\ntrials[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=52\n\"Edit section: Same-day trials\")]\n\nIn December 2012, the USPS began a limited one-year trial of same-day\ndeliveries directly from retailers or distribution hubs to residential\naddresses in the same local area, a service it dubbed \"Metro Post\".[196][197]\nThe trial was initially limited to San Francisco and the only retailer to\nparticipate in the first few weeks was [1-800-FLOWERS](/wiki/1-800-FLOWERS\n\"1-800-FLOWERS\").[198]\n\nIn March 2013, the USPS faced new same-day competition for e-commerce\ndeliveries from [Google Shopping Express](/wiki/Google_Shopping_Express\n\"Google Shopping Express\").\n\nIn November 2013, the Postal Service began regular package delivery on Sundays\nfor Amazon customers in New York and Los Angeles,[199] which it expanded to 15\ncities in May 2014.[200] Amazon Sunday delivery has now been expanded to most\nmajor markets as of September 2015.\n\nOther competition in this area includes [online grocers](/wiki/Online_grocer\n\"Online grocer\") such as [AmazonFresh](/wiki/AmazonFresh \"AmazonFresh\"),\n[Webvan](/wiki/Webvan \"Webvan\"), and delivery services operated by grocery\nstores like [Peapod](/wiki/Peapod \"Peapod\") and [Safeway](/wiki/Safeway_Inc.\n\"Safeway Inc.\").\n\n#### Forwarding and\nholds[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=53\n\"Edit section: Forwarding and holds\")]\n\nResidential customers can fill out a form to forward mail to a new address,\nand can also send pre-printed forms to any of their frequent correspondents.\nThey can also put their mail on \"hold\", for example, while on vacation. The\nPost Office will store mail during the hold, instead of letting it overflow in\nthe mailbox. These services are not available to large buildings and customers\nof a [commercial mail receiving agency](/wiki/Commercial_mail_receiving_agency\n\"Commercial mail receiving agency\"),[201] where mail is subsorted by non-Post\nOffice employees into individual mailboxes.\n\n## Financial\nservices[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=54\n\"Edit section: Financial services\")]\n\nPostal [money orders](/wiki/Money_order \"Money order\") provide a safe\nalternative to sending [cash](/wiki/Cash \"Cash\") through the mail, and are\navailable in any amount up to $1,000. Like a bank [cheque](/wiki/Cheque\n\"Cheque\"), money orders are cashable only by the recipient.

They are divided into two categories: **City Letter Carriers** , who are represented by the NALC, and **[Rural Letter Carriers](/wiki/Rural_Letter_Carrier \"Rural Letter Carrier\")** , who are represented by the NRLCA. City Carriers are paid hourly with automatic overtime paid after 8 hours or 40 hours a week of duty. City Carriers are required to work in any kind of weather, daylight or dark and carry three bundles of mail (letters in one hand, magazines in the other and advertisements in a mailbag) in addition to parcels up to a total of 70 lbs. Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the Carriers' whereabouts up until the last 5 minutes of any given workday.\n  * **Rural carriers** are under a form of salary called \"evaluated hours\", usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted.\n  * **Mail handlers and processors** , prepare, separate, load and unload mail and parcels, by delivery ZIP code and station, for the clerks. They work almost exclusively at the plants or larger mail facilities now after having their duties excessed and reassigned to clerks in Post Offices and Station branches.\n  * **Clerks** , have a dual function by design of where their assignment is. Window clerks directly handle customer service needs at the counter, sort box mail and also sort first-class letters, standard and bulk-rate mail for the carriers on the work floor. Clerks may also work alongside mail handlers in large sorting facilities, outside of the public view, sorting mail. Data Conversion Operators, who encode address information at Remote Encoding Centers, are also members of the clerk craft. Mail handlers and Clerks are represented by the NPMHU and the APWU, respectively.\n\nOther non-managerial positions in the USPS include:\n\n  * **Maintenance and custodians** , who see to the overall operation and cleaning of mail sorting machines, work areas, public parking and general facility operations.\n  * **City Carrier Assistants**. (CCAs) With the Das Arbitration award the designation of PTF City Carrier has been abolished. TE City Carriers will have the opportunity to become CCAs. A CCA is a non-career employee who is hired for a 360-day term, similar to what TEs had. CCAs earn annual leave. CCAs, unlike TEs do have a direct path to becoming career employees. When excess City Carrier positions exist the CCA in that work installation with the highest \"relative standing\" will be promoted to a career employee and be assigned to the vacant position.\n  * **Career, Part Time Flexible and Transitional employees** (Career, PTF & TE) There are a variety of other non-managerial positions in such crafts as accounting, information technology, and the remote encoding center. These are under a different contract than plant workers or mail carriers.[207]\n\nThough the USPS employs many individuals, as more Americans send information\nvia email, fewer postal workers are needed to work dwindling amounts of mail.\nPost offices and mail facilities are constantly downsizing, replacing craft\npositions with new machines and consolidating mail routes through the MIARAP\n(Modified Interim Alternate Route Adjustment Process) agreement. A major round\nof job cuts, early retirements, and a construction freeze were announced on\nMarch 20, 2009.[208]\n\n### Workplace\nviolence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&action=edit&section=56\n\"Edit section: Workplace violence\")]\n\nMain article: [List of postal killings § United\nStates](/wiki/List_of_postal_killings#United_States \"List of postal killings\")\n\nIn the early 1990s, widely publicized [workplace\nshootings](/wiki/Workplace_violence \"Workplace violence\") by disgruntled\nemployees at USPS facilities led to a Human Resource effort to provide care\nfor stressed workers and resources for coworker conflicts.[209] Due to media\ncoverage, postal employees gained a reputation among the general public as\nmore likely to be [mentally ill](/wiki/Mental_disorder \"Mental disorder\"). The\nUSPS Commission on a Safe and Secure Workplace found that \"Postal workers are\nonly a third as likely as those in the national workforce to be victims of\nhomicide at work.\"[210] In the documentary _Murder by Proxy: How America Went\nPostal_ , it was argued that this number failed to factor out workers killed\nby external subjects rather than by fellow employees.\n\nThis series of events in turn has influenced American culture, as seen in the\nslang term \"[going postal](/wiki/Going_postal \"Going postal\")\"[211][212] (see\n[Patrick Sherrill](/wiki/Patrick_Sherrill \"Patrick Sherrill\") for information\non his August 20, 1986, rampage) and the computer game\n_[Postal](/wiki/Postal_\\(video_game\\) \"Postal \\(video game\\)\")_.

The contention was that it would have been illegal for the United States Post Office to deliver mail that was addressed to \"Santa Claus\" to the character \"Kris Kringle\" unless he were, in fact, the one and only Santa Claus. Judge Henry X. Harper (played by [Gene Lockhart](/wiki/Gene_Lockhart \"Gene Lockhart\")) ruled that since the U.S. Government had demonstrated through the delivery of the bags of mail that Kris Kringle was Santa Claus, the [State of New York](/wiki/State_of_New_York \"State of New York\") did not have the authority to overrule that decision.\n  * The novel _[Post Office](/wiki/Post_Office_\\(novel\\) \"Post Office \\(novel\\)\")_ (1971), written by poet and novelist [Charles Bukowski](/wiki/Charles_Bukowski \"Charles Bukowski\"), is a semi-autobiographical account of his life over the years as a mail carrier.
