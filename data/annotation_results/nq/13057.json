The\ndiameter of the appendix is usually between 7 and 8 mm. The longest appendix\never removed was 26 cm long. It was removed from a patient in\n[Zagreb](/wiki/Zagreb \"Zagreb\"), [Croatia](/wiki/Croatia \"Croatia\").[1] The\nappendix is usually located in the lower right\n[quadrant](/wiki/Quadrant_\\(anatomy\\) \"Quadrant \\(anatomy\\)\") of the\n[abdomen](/wiki/Abdomen \"Abdomen\"), near the right [hip\nbone](/wiki/Iliac_fossa \"Iliac fossa\"). The base of the appendix is located 2\ncm beneath the [ileocecal valve](/wiki/Ileocecal_valve \"Ileocecal valve\") that\nseparates the large intestine from the small intestine. Its position within\nthe abdomen corresponds to a point on the surface known as [McBurney's\npoint](/wiki/McBurney%27s_point \"McBurney's point\").\n\nThe appendix is connected to the [mesentery](/wiki/Mesentery \"Mesentery\") in\nthe lower region of the [ileum](/wiki/Ileum \"Ileum\"), by a short region of the\n[mesocolon](/wiki/Mesentery \"Mesentery\") known as the\n[mesoappendix](/wiki/Mesentery#Segments \"Mesentery\").[2]\n\n###\nVariation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Variation\")]\n\nSome identical twins—known as [mirror image\ntwins](/wiki/Twin#Mirror_image_twins \"Twin\")—can have a [mirror-imaged\nanatomy](/wiki/Situs_inversus \"Situs inversus\"), a [congenital\ncondition](/wiki/Congenital_disorder \"Congenital disorder\") with the appendix\nlocated in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen.[3][4][5] [Intestinal\nmalrotation](/wiki/Intestinal_malrotation \"Intestinal malrotation\") may also\ncause displacement of the appendix to the left side.\n\nWhile the base of the appendix is at a fairly constant location—2 cm below the\n[ileocecal valve](/wiki/Ileocecal_valve \"Ileocecal valve\"), the tip of the\nappendix can be variably located—in the [pelvis](/wiki/Pelvis \"Pelvis\"),\noutside the [peritoneum](/wiki/Peritoneum \"Peritoneum\") or behind the\ncecum.[6] The prevalence of the different positions varies amongst populations\nwith the retrocecal position being most common in [Ghana](/wiki/Ghana \"Ghana\")\nand [Sudan](/wiki/Sudan \"Sudan\"), with 67.3% and 58.3% occurrence\nrespectively, in comparison to [Iran](/wiki/Iran \"Iran\") and\n[Bosnia](/wiki/Bosnia \"Bosnia\") where the pelvic position is most common, with\n55.8% and 57.7% occurrence respectively.[7][8][9][10]\n\nIn very rare cases ([laparotomies](/wiki/Laparotomy \"Laparotomy\") for\nsuspected appendicitis have given a frequency of 1 in 100,000), the appendix\nmay not be present at all.[11]\n\nSometimes there is a semi-circular fold of [mucous\nmembrane](/wiki/Mucous_membrane \"Mucous membrane\") at the opening of the\nappendix. This _valve of the vermiform appendix_ is also called [Gerlach's\nvalve](/wiki/Joseph_von_Gerlach \"Joseph von Gerlach\").[2]\n\n##\nFunctions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Functions\")]\n\n### Maintaining gut\nflora[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Maintaining gut flora\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Appendix_function_diagram.svg/220px-\nAppendix_function_diagram.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Appendix_function_diagram.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Appendix_function_diagram.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA possible function of the human appendix is a \"safe house\" for beneficial\nbacteria in the recovery from [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea \"Diarrhea\").\n\nAlthough it has been long accepted that the immune tissue surrounding the\nappendix and elsewhere in the gut—called [gut associated lymphoid\ntissue](/wiki/Gut_associated_lymphoid_tissue \"Gut associated lymphoid\ntissue\")—carries out a number of important functions, explanations were\nlacking for the distinctive shape of the appendix and its apparent lack of\nspecific importance and function as judged by an absence of side effects\nfollowing [its removal](/wiki/Appendectomy \"Appendectomy\").[12] Therefore, the\nnotion that the appendix is only [vestigial](/wiki/Vestigiality\n\"Vestigiality\") became widely held.\n\nWilliam Parker, Randy Bollinger, and colleagues at [Duke\nUniversity](/wiki/Duke_University \"Duke University\") proposed in 2007 that the\nappendix serves as a haven for useful [bacteria](/wiki/Bacteria \"Bacteria\")\nwhen illness flushes those bacteria from the rest of the intestines.[13][14]\nThis proposal is based on an understanding that emerged by the early 2000s of\nhow the immune system supports the growth of beneficial [intestinal\nbacteria](/wiki/Gut_flora \"Gut flora\"),[15][16] in combination with many well-\nknown features of the appendix, including its architecture, its location just\nbelow the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine, and\nits association with copious amounts of immune tissue. Research performed at\n[Winthrop–University Hospital](/wiki/Winthrop%E2%80%93University_Hospital\n\"Winthrop–University Hospital\") showed that individuals without an appendix\nwere four times more likely to have a recurrence of _[Clostridium difficile\ncolitis](/wiki/Clostridium_difficile_colitis \"Clostridium difficile\ncolitis\")_.[17] The appendix, therefore, may act as a safe house for good\nbacteria.[13] This reservoir of bacteria could then serve to repopulate the\n[gut flora](/wiki/Gut_flora \"Gut flora\") in the [digestive\nsystem](/wiki/Human_digestive_system \"Human digestive system\") following a\nbout of [dysentery](/wiki/Dysentery \"Dysentery\") or [cholera](/wiki/Cholera\n\"Cholera\"), or boost it following a milder gastrointestinal illness.[14]\n\n### Immune and lymphatic\nsystem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Immune and lymphatic system\")]\n\nThe appendix has been identified as an important component of mammalian\n[mucosal immune function](/wiki/Mucosal_immunology \"Mucosal immunology\"),\nparticularly [B cell](/wiki/B_cell \"B cell\") mediated immune responses and\n[extrathymically](/wiki/Thymus \"Thymus\") derived [T cells](/wiki/T_cell \"T\ncell\"). This structure helps in the proper movement and removal of waste\nmatter in the digestive system, contains lymphatic vessels that regulate\npathogens, and lastly, might even produce early defences that prevent deadly\ndiseases. Additionally, it is thought that this may provide more immune\ndefences from invading pathogens and getting the lymphatic system's B and T\ncells to fight the viruses and bacteria that infect that portion of the bowel\nand training them, so that immune responses are targeted and more able to\nreliably and less dangerously fight off pathogens.[18] In addition there are\ndifferent immune cells called [innate lymphoid\ncells](/wiki/Innate_lymphoid_cell \"Innate lymphoid cell\") that function in the\ngut, to help the appendix maintain digestive health.[19][20]\n\n###\nVestigiality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Vestigiality\")]\n\nThe human appendix had been proposed to be a [vestigial\nstructure](/wiki/Human_vestigiality \"Human vestigiality\"), a structure that\nhas lost all or most of its original function, or that has evolved to take on\na new function. The suggestion was that it is the shrunken remnant of the\n[cecum](/wiki/Cecum \"Cecum\") thought to have been present in a remote ancestor\nof humans. This notion is still widely held. A 2013 study, however, refutes\nthe idea of an inverse relationship between cecum size and appendix size and\npresence.[21] Ceca, which occur in the digestive tracts of many herbivores\n(e.g. ox, horse), house mutualistic bacteria and ingested small stones that\nhelp animals digest the cellulose molecules found in plants.[22]\n\nIt is widely present in [euarchontoglires](/wiki/Euarchontoglires\n\"Euarchontoglires\") (a superorder of mammals that includes rodents and\nprimates) and has also evolved [independently](/wiki/Convergent_evolution\n\"Convergent evolution\") in the [diprotodont](/wiki/Diprotodont \"Diprotodont\")\n[marsupials](/wiki/Marsupials \"Marsupials\"), [monotremes](/wiki/Monotremes\n\"Monotremes\"), and is highly diverse in size and shape.[21][23]\n\nA possible scenario for the progression from a fully functional cecum to the\ncurrent human appendix was put forth by [Charles Darwin](/wiki/Charles_Darwin\n\"Charles Darwin\"). He suggested that the appendix was used for digesting\nleaves as [primates](/wiki/Primate \"Primate\"). It may be a vestigial organ of\nancient humans that has degraded to nearly nothing of its original purpose, or\nevolved to take on a new purpose over the course of evolution. The very long\ncecum of some herbivorous animals, such as found in the [horse](/wiki/Horse\n\"Horse\") or the [koala](/wiki/Koala \"Koala\"), appears to support this theory.\nThe koala's cecum enables it to host bacteria that specifically help to break\ndown cellulose. Human ancestors may have also relied upon this system when\nthey lived on a diet rich in foliage. As people began to eat more easily\ndigested foods, they may have become less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for\nenergy. As the cecum became less necessary for digestion, mutations that were\npreviously deleterious (and would have hindered evolutionary progress) were no\nlonger important, so the mutations survived. It is suggested that these\n[alleles](/wiki/Allele \"Allele\") became more frequent and the cecum continued\nto shrink. After millions of years, the once-necessary cecum degraded to be\nthe appendix of modern humans.[24]\n\n## Clinical\nsignificance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Clinical significance\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Appendiceal_carcinoid_1.JPG/220px-\nAppendiceal_carcinoid_1.JPG)](/wiki/File:Appendiceal_carcinoid_1.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Appendiceal_carcinoid_1.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn appendiceal carcinoid tumor\n\nThe most common [diseases](/wiki/Disease \"Disease\") of the appendix (in\nhumans) are [appendicitis](/wiki/Appendicitis \"Appendicitis\") and\n[carcinoid](/wiki/Carcinoid \"Carcinoid\") tumors (appendiceal carcinoid).[25]\n[Appendix cancer](/wiki/Appendix_cancer \"Appendix cancer\") accounts for about\n1 in 200 of all gastrointestinal malignancies. In rare cases,\n[adenomas](/wiki/Adenomas \"Adenomas\") are also present.[26]\n\n###\nAppendicitis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Appendicitis\")]\n\nMain article: [Appendicitis](/wiki/Appendicitis \"Appendicitis\")\n\n[Appendicitis](/wiki/Appendicitis \"Appendicitis\") is a condition characterized\nby [inflammation](/wiki/Inflammation \"Inflammation\") of the appendix. Pain\noften begins in the center of the abdomen, corresponding to the appendix's\ndevelopment as part of the embryonic [midgut](/wiki/Midgut \"Midgut\"). This\npain is typically a dull, poorly localized, [visceral](/wiki/Viscus \"Viscus\")\npain.[27]\n\nAs the inflammation progresses, the pain begins to localize more clearly to\nthe right lower quadrant, as the [peritoneum](/wiki/Peritoneum \"Peritoneum\")\nbecomes inflamed. This peritoneal inflammation, or\n[peritonitis](/wiki/Peritonitis \"Peritonitis\"), results in [rebound\ntenderness](/wiki/Rebound_tenderness \"Rebound tenderness\") (pain upon removal\nof pressure rather than application of pressure). In particular, it presents\nat [McBurney's point](/wiki/McBurney%27s_point \"McBurney's point\"), 1/3 of the\nway along a line drawn from the [anterior superior iliac\nspine](/wiki/Anterior_superior_iliac_spine \"Anterior superior iliac spine\") to\nthe [umbilicus](/wiki/Navel \"Navel\"). Typically, point (skin) pain is not\npresent until the [parietal peritoneum](/wiki/Parietal_peritoneum \"Parietal\nperitoneum\") is inflamed, as well. Fever and an immune system response are\nalso characteristic of appendicitis.[27]\n\nAppendicitis usually requires the removal of the inflamed appendix, in an\n[appendectomy](/wiki/Appendectomy \"Appendectomy\") either by\n[laparotomy](/wiki/Laparotomy \"Laparotomy\") or [laparoscopy](/wiki/Laparoscopy\n\"Laparoscopy\"). Untreated, the appendix may rupture, leading to\n[peritonitis](/wiki/Peritonitis \"Peritonitis\"), followed by shock, and, if\nstill untreated, death.[27]\n\n###\nSurgery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Surgery\")]\n\nMain article: [Appendectomy](/wiki/Appendectomy \"Appendectomy\")\n\nThe surgical removal of the appendix is called an\n[appendectomy](/wiki/Appendectomy \"Appendectomy\"). This removal is normally\nperformed as an emergency procedure when the patient is suffering from\n[acute](/wiki/Acute_\\(medical\\) \"Acute \\(medical\\)\") appendicitis. In the\nabsence of surgical facilities, [intravenous](/wiki/Intravenous \"Intravenous\")\n[antibiotics](/wiki/Antibiotics \"Antibiotics\") are used to delay or avoid the\nonset of [sepsis](/wiki/Sepsis \"Sepsis\"). In some cases, the appendicitis\nresolves completely; more often, an inflammatory mass forms around the\nappendix. This is a relative [contraindication](/wiki/Contraindication\n\"Contraindication\") to surgery.\n\nThe appendix is also used for the construction of an efferent urinary conduit,\nin an operation known as the [Mitrofanoff\nprocedure](/wiki/Mitrofanoff_procedure \"Mitrofanoff procedure\"),[28] in people\nwith a [neurogenic bladder](/wiki/Neurogenic_bladder \"Neurogenic bladder\").\n\nThe appendix is also used as a means to access the colon in children with\nparalysed bowels or major rectal sphincter problems. The appendix is brought\nout to the skin surface and the child/parent can then attach a catheter and\neasily wash out the colon (via normal defaecation) using an appropriate\nsolution.[29]\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nDr. Heather F. Smith of [Midwestern University](/wiki/Midwestern_University\n\"Midwestern University\") and colleagues explained:\n\n> Recently ... improved understanding of gut immunity has merged with current\n> thinking in biological and medical science, pointing to an apparent function\n> of the mammalian cecal appendix as a safe-house for symbiotic gut microbes,\n> preserving the flora during times of gastrointestinal infection in societies\n> without modern medicine. This function is potentially a selective force for\n> the evolution and maintenance of the appendix. Three morphotypes of cecal-\n> appendices can be described among mammals based primarily on the shape of\n> the cecum: a distinct appendix branching from a rounded or sac-like cecum\n> (as in many primate species), an appendix located at the apex of a long and\n> voluminous cecum (as in the rabbit, greater glider and Cape dune mole rat),\n> and an appendix in the absence of a pronounced cecum (as in the wombat). In\n> addition, long narrow appendix-like structures are found in mammals that\n> either lack an apparent cecum (as in monotremes) or lack a distinct junction\n> between the cecum and appendix-like structure (as in the koala). A cecal\n> appendix has evolved independently at least twice, and apparently represents\n> yet another example of convergence in morphology between Australian\n> marsupials and placentals in the rest of the world. Although the appendix\n> has apparently been lost by numerous species, it has also been maintained\n> for more than 80 million years in at least one clade.[23]\n\nIn a more recent paper, the appendix was found to have evolved at least 32\ntimes (and perhaps as many as 38 times) and to have been lost no more than six\ntimes.[21] This suggests that the cecal appendix has a selective advantage in\nmany situations and argues strongly against its vestigial nature. This complex\nevolutionary history of the appendix, along with a great heterogeneity in its\nevolutionary rate in various taxa, suggests that it is a recurrent trait.[30]\n\nSuch a function may be useful in a culture lacking modern sanitation and\nhealthcare practice, where [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea \"Diarrhea\") may be\nprevalent. Current [epidemiological](/wiki/Epidemiology \"Epidemiology\") data\non the cause of death in developed countries collected by the [World Health\nOrganization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization \"World Health Organization\") in\n2001 show that acute diarrhea is now the fourth leading cause of disease-\nrelated death in developing countries (data summarized by The [Bill and\nMelinda Gates Foundation](/wiki/Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation \"Bill and\nMelinda Gates Foundation\")). Two of the other leading causes of death are\nexpected to have exerted limited or no selection pressure.[31][32]\n\n## Additional\nimages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Additional images\")]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Blausen_0043_Appendix_Child.png/60px-Blausen_0043_Appendix_Child.png)](/wiki/File:Blausen_0043_Appendix_Child.png)\n\nIllustration depicting the location of the appendix in a child\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Stomach_colon_rectum_diagram-en.svg/116px-Stomach_colon_rectum_diagram-en.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Stomach_colon_rectum_diagram-en.svg)\n\nNormal location of the appendix relative to other organs of the digestive\nsystem (frontal view)\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Appendix_vermiformis.jpg/120px-Appendix_vermiformis.jpg)](/wiki/File:Appendix_vermiformis.jpg)\n\nVermiform appendix\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Ileocecal_orifice.JPG/120px-Ileocecal_orifice.JPG)](/wiki/File:Ileocecal_orifice.JPG)\n\n[Ileo-cecal valve](/wiki/Ileo-cecal_valve \"Ileo-cecal valve\") and vermiform\nappendix\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Appendixcancer.jpg/120px-Appendixcancer.jpg)](/wiki/File:Appendixcancer.jpg)\n\nMucinous [adenocarcinoma](/wiki/Adenocarcinoma \"Adenocarcinoma\") of the\nappendix tip\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Enterobius_-_very_low_mag.jpg/120px-Enterobius_-_very_low_mag.jpg)](/wiki/File:Enterobius_-_very_low_mag.jpg)\n\n[Cross section](/wiki/Cross_section_\\(geometry\\) \"Cross section \\(geometry\\)\")\nof the appendix with _[Enterobius](/wiki/Enterobius \"Enterobius\")_ with [H&E\nstain](/wiki/H%26E_stain \"H&E stain\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Histology_of_human_appendix.jpg/120px-Histology_of_human_appendix.jpg)](/wiki/File:Histology_of_human_appendix.jpg)\n\nHistology of vermiform appendix\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Meckel's diverticulum](/wiki/Meckel%27s_diverticulum \"Meckel's diverticulum\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Appendix_\\(anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Largest appendix removed\"](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-appendix-removed).
