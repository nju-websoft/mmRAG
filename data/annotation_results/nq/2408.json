The\n[National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation](/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National\nCollegiate Athletic Association\") (NCAA) [Men's Division I Basketball\nChampionship](/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship \"NCAA\nMen's Division I Basketball Championship\"), or NCAA Tournament, is a [single-\nelimination tournament](/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament \"Single-\nelimination tournament\") for men's [college\nbasketball](/wiki/College_basketball \"College basketball\") teams in the United\nStates. It determines the champion of [Division I](/wiki/NCAA_Division_I \"NCAA\nDivision I\"), the top level of play in the NCAA,[1] and the media often\ndescribes the winner as the national champion of college basketball.[2][3] The\nNCAA Tournament has been held annually since 1939, and its field grew from\neight teams in the beginning to sixty-five teams by 2001; as of 2011, sixty-\neight teams take part in the tournament.[4][5] Teams can [gain\ninvitations](/wiki/NCAA_basketball_tournament_selection_process \"NCAA\nbasketball tournament selection process\") by winning a conference championship\nor receiving an [at-large bid](/wiki/At-large_bid \"At-large bid\") from a\n10-person committee.[6] The semifinals of the tournament are known as the\n[Final Four](/wiki/Final_Four \"Final Four\") and are held in a different city\neach year, along with the championship game;[7]\n[Indianapolis](/wiki/Indianapolis \"Indianapolis\"), the city where the NCAA is\nbased, will host the Final Four every five years until 2040.[8] Each winning\nuniversity receives a rectangular, gold-plated trophy made of wood.[9]\n\nThe [first NCAA\nTournament](/wiki/1939_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament \"1939\nNCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament\") was organized by the [National\nAssociation of Basketball\nCoaches](/wiki/National_Association_of_Basketball_Coaches \"National\nAssociation of Basketball Coaches\").[10]\n[Oregon](/wiki/Oregon_Ducks_men%27s_basketball \"Oregon Ducks men's\nbasketball\") won the inaugural tournament, defeating [Ohio\nState](/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_men%27s_basketball \"Ohio State Buckeyes men's\nbasketball\") 46–33 in the first championship game. Before the 1941 tournament,\ncontrol of the event was given to the NCAA.[10] In the early years of the\ntournament, it was considered less important than the [National Invitation\nTournament](/wiki/National_Invitation_Tournament \"National Invitation\nTournament\") (NIT), a New York City-based event.[11][12] Teams were able to\ncompete in both events in the same year, and three of those that did\nso—[Utah](/wiki/Utah_Utes_men%27s_basketball \"Utah Utes men's basketball\") in\n1944, [Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men%27s_basketball \"Kentucky Wildcats\nmen's basketball\") in 1949, and [City College of New\nYork](/wiki/City_College_of_New_York \"City College of New York\") (CCNY) in\n1950—won the NCAA Tournament.[13] The [1949–50 CCNY\nteam](/wiki/1949%E2%80%9350_CCNY_Beavers_men%27s_basketball_team \"1949–50 CCNY\nBeavers men's basketball team\") won both tournaments (defeating\n[Bradley](/wiki/Bradley_Braves_men%27s_basketball \"Bradley Braves men's\nbasketball\") in both finals), and is the only college basketball team to\naccomplish this feat.[14] By the mid-1950s, the NCAA Tournament became the\nmore prestigious of the two events,[15] and in 1971 the NCAA barred\nuniversities from playing in other tournaments, such as the NIT, if they were\ninvited to the NCAA Tournament.[16]\n\nThe [University of California, Los\nAngeles](/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball \"UCLA Bruins men's basketball\")\n(UCLA) has been the most successful college in the NCAA Tournament, winning 11\nnational titles. Ten of those championships came during a 12-year stretch from\n1964 to 1975. UCLA also holds the record for the most consecutive\nchampionships, winning seven in a row from 1967 to 1973. Kentucky has the\nsecond-most titles, with eight. [North\nCarolina](/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_men%27s_basketball \"North Carolina\nTar Heels men's basketball\") is third with six championships, while\n[Duke](/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men%27s_basketball \"Duke Blue Devils men's\nbasketball\") and [Indiana](/wiki/Indiana_Hoosiers_men%27s_basketball \"Indiana\nHoosiers men's basketball\") follow with five each.\n[Villanova](/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men%27s_basketball \"Villanova Wildcats\nmen's basketball\") is the most recent champion, having defeated\n[Michigan](/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_men%27s_basketball \"Michigan Wolverines\nmen's basketball\") in the final of the 2018 tournament. Among [head\ncoaches](/wiki/Coach_\\(basketball\\) \"Coach \\(basketball\\)\"), [John\nWooden](/wiki/John_Wooden \"John Wooden\") is the all-time leader with 10\nchampionships; he coached UCLA during their period of success in the 1960s and\n1970s.
