Always\nat the center of the trouble and confusion is head of the clan and matriarch\n[Thelma Harper](/wiki/Thelma_Harper \"Thelma Harper\")—a buxom, blue-haired,\npurse-lipped, 65-year-old widow who is portrayed as explosively quick-\ntempered, abrasive and brash.[6] Thelma's snappy retorts and wisecracks are\nfeatured in a [running gag](/wiki/Running_gag \"Running gag\") in which the\nfinal scenes of each episode cut to an exterior shot of her house while she is\nheard riposting the comments of whomever had previously spoken, followed by\naudience laughter and [applause](/wiki/Applause \"Applause\"). In spite of\nThelma's brusqueness, she is nurturing and obliging at heart, allowing family\nmembers to live in her home who would otherwise have no place to live, while\nalso cooking for and cleaning up after them.[6] Thelma's family members can be\ningrates, even banding together and ganging up on Thelma on occasion.\n\n## Network run (seasons\n1–2)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Network run \\(seasons 1–2\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/81/Mama%27s_Family_sitcom%27s_first_life_cast.png/200px-\nMama%27s_Family_sitcom%27s_first_life_cast.png)](/wiki/File:Mama%27s_Family_sitcom%27s_first_life_cast.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mama%27s_Family_sitcom%27s_first_life_cast.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nCast of the first life of _Mama 's Family_ (clockwise from bottom left): Buzz,\nVinton, Naomi, Ed (recurring character), Ellen (recurring), Fran, Sonja, and\nThelma\n\n### Beginning the\nseries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Beginning the series\")]\n\nIn the ninth season of _The Carol Burnett Show_ , producer [Joe\nHamilton](/wiki/Joe_Hamilton_\\(producer\\) \"Joe Hamilton \\(producer\\)\") wanted\nto spin off Mama in her own series, but Lawrence turned him down. She did not\nwish to wear a fat suit portraying an old lady every week, and she had\nmisgivings about playing the role without [Harvey Korman](/wiki/Harvey_Korman\n\"Harvey Korman\") (who played Mama's son-in-law, [Ed Higgins](/wiki/Ed_Higgins\n\"Ed Higgins\")) and [Carol Burnett](/wiki/Carol_Burnett \"Carol Burnett\") (who\nplayed Mama's daughter [Eunice Higgins](/wiki/Eunice_Higgins \"Eunice\nHiggins\")) regularly by her side as in \"The Family\" sketches. Burnett and\nKorman told Lawrence that they would only appear as guest stars on the new\nseries, and that it was Lawrence's time to shine and take what she had learned\nfrom _The Carol Burnett Show_ and make it on her own. Shortly after the highly\nrated _[Eunice](/wiki/Eunice_\\(film\\) \"Eunice \\(film\\)\")_ TV movie, with\ncontinued urging by Korman and Burnett, Lawrence finally changed her mind and\naccepted the offer for her character's own sitcom.[7]\n\nThe writers had created Raytown to be its own \"cartoon-like\" world outside of\nreality. Even though the series was sold to NBC without a\n[pilot](/wiki/Television_pilot \"Television pilot\"), the network had its own\nrequirements, such as having \"normal\" teenagers as seen in other sitcoms of\nthe time, which is how the Buzz and Sonja characters came about.[8] However,\nLawrence had a great deal of creative input and made many important decisions,\nincluding bringing in Korman very early on to co-direct the series. Lawrence\nhad objections to the original script of the episode \"Mama Cries Uncle\", in\nwhich Thelma's brother-in-law comes to visit and the two are supposed to have\nwound up sleeping together:\n\n“ | I went to the writers and I said, 'I'm sorry, she is nothing if not [Bible Belt](/wiki/Bible_Belt \"Bible Belt\"). She would never sleep with her brother-in-law. I don't care how dead her husband is, This is wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong'. Well, threw everything into a tizzy and Joe [Hamilton] said, 'Gotta listen to her,' and they re-wrote the second half of the show.[7] | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \nAccording to her autobiography, Lawrence had a problem with the decision to\nfilm the series on Stage 33 at [CBS Television City](/wiki/CBS_Television_City\n\"CBS Television City\"), where _The Carol Burnett Show_ was\nproduced.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Plot\ndetails[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Plot details\")]\n\nFor one and a half seasons from 1983 through 1984, _Mama 's Family_ ran on\nNBC. In the series' first episode, Thelma Harper lives with her uptight\n[spinster](/wiki/Spinster \"Spinster\") sister Fran ([Rue\nMcClanahan](/wiki/Rue_McClanahan \"Rue McClanahan\")), a journalist for a local\npaper. Thelma's son, Vinton (whose wife, Mitzi, had left him to become a\ncocktail waitress in [Las Vegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada \"Las Vegas,\nNevada\")), stops by to inform Thelma that he and his two children, Sonja and\nBuzz, have been evicted from their home and need a place to stay. Much to\nFran's chagrin, Thelma allows Vint, Sonja and Buzz to move in.\n\nDuring the first season, Vinton forged a relationship with the Harpers'\nflirtatious next-door neighbor, Naomi Oates (whom Thelma disliked), and soon\nmarried her. After selling Naomi's house and losing the money in a bad\nbusiness deal, Naomi and Vint are forced to move into Thelma's basement, where\nthey remain for most of the show's run. Also seen on a recurring basis were\nThelma's two daughters: the snobbish Ellen ([Betty White](/wiki/Betty_White\n\"Betty White\")) and the ornery Eunice (Carol Burnett). Harvey Korman, who\ndirected many of the earlier episodes, made featured appearances as Eunice's\nhusband, Ed Higgins. (During the eleventh and final season of _The Carol\nBurnett Show_ , the Ed Higgins character was written out of \"The Family\"\nskits, having left Eunice).\n\n### Opening theme\ndiscrepancies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Opening theme discrepancies\")]\n\nKorman also appeared at the beginning of each episode as the stuffed shirt\nAlistair Quince (an obvious parody of [Alistair Cooke](/wiki/Alistair_Cooke\n\"Alistair Cooke\")), who would soberly introduce the program in the style of\n_[Masterpiece Theatre](/wiki/Masterpiece_Theatre \"Masterpiece Theatre\")_.\nThese monologues were cut out of the later syndicated reruns.[9] Korman also\nperformed the voice of Thelma's unseen late husband, Carl, in flashback\nepisodes.\n\nAn extended version of the show's opening theme song, with repeated melodies,\nwas used during the original NBC run, but was never used in reruns.\n\nThe house and neighborhood shown in the opening credits differed between the\noriginal NBC run and the syndicated shows, leading to discrepancies such as in\nthe episode \"[Mama for Mayor](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes \"List of\nMama's Family episodes\")\", in which Mama is shown in front of the house used\nin the original opening theme used for the first two seasons.\n\nIn 2013, [StarVista Entertainment](/wiki/StarVista_Entertainment \"StarVista\nEntertainment\") released the original NBC seasons with the Alistair Quince\nintros and original opening credits intact, except for two episodes in Season\n1 (\"Cellmates\" and \"Mama's Boyfriend\"), as the master prints of those episodes\nare lost and were replaced by the syndicated version in the re-release.\n\n###\nCancellation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Cancellation\")]\n\nWhile not a huge ratings success, the first season garnered solid enough\nnumbers to justify being renewed for a second season.[10] For instance, the\npremiere episode ranked #28 for the week with an 18.6/28 rating/share.\nHowever, during the second season, the show dropped out of the top 50 shows,\nlosing share to CBS' hit _[Magnum, P.I.](/wiki/Magnum,_P.I. \"Magnum, P.I.\")_\nAs a result, NBC canceled the series in May 1984.\n\n## First-run syndication (Seasons\n3–6)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: First-run syndication \\(Seasons 3–6\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/60/Mama%27s_Family_sitcom%27s_second_life_cast.png/220px-\nMama%27s_Family_sitcom%27s_second_life_cast.png)](/wiki/File:Mama%27s_Family_sitcom%27s_second_life_cast.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mama%27s_Family_sitcom%27s_second_life_cast.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nCast of the second life of _Mama 's Family_ (clockwise from center left):\nIola, Bubba, Vinton, Naomi, and Mama.\n\n### Series\nrebirth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Series rebirth\")]\n\nAfter _Mama 's Family_ was canceled by NBC in 1984, it was later relaunched in\n[first-run syndication](/wiki/First-run_syndication \"First-run syndication\")\nin 1986. [Lorimar](/wiki/Lorimar \"Lorimar\") had merged with\n[Telepictures](/wiki/Telepictures \"Telepictures\") and were looking for\nprojects for first-run syndication, and after seeing the show's ratings in the\nsummer reruns, it decided that the show needed a second chance and ordered 100\nepisodes for syndication.[7][11]\n\n### Plot\ndetails[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Plot details\")]\n\nSince the original set had been destroyed, a new set had to be constructed.\nThis led to some significant changes in [set design](/wiki/Set_construction\n\"Set construction\") details. Adjustments in the show's cast occurred as well,\nwith only Vicki Lawrence (Thelma), Ken Berry (Vinton) and Dorothy Lyman\n(Naomi) returning as regulars from the first life of the sitcom. Vinton's kids\nfrom his first marriage, Buzz (played by [Eric\nBrown](/wiki/Eric_Brown_\\(actor\\) \"Eric Brown \\(actor\\)\")) and Sonja (played\nby [Karin Argoud](/wiki/Karin_Argoud \"Karin Argoud\")), who were regulars in\nthe show's first life, did not reprise their roles for the show's revival;\ntheir characters, though mentioned briefly in the first episode of the show's\nsyndicated life, were never to be spoken of again.\n\nDuring the hiatus of the series, both [Rue McClanahan](/wiki/Rue_McClanahan\n\"Rue McClanahan\") (Aunt Fran) and [Betty White](/wiki/Betty_White \"Betty\nWhite\") (Ellen Jackson) had both gone on to star in the NBC sitcom _[The\nGolden Girls](/wiki/The_Golden_Girls \"The Golden Girls\")_ , rendering them\nunavailable to return. White, however, did return as Ellen for one episode in\n1986 while Fran was killed off in the first episode of the revival. [Carol\nBurnett](/wiki/Carol_Burnett \"Carol Burnett\") and [Harvey\nKorman](/wiki/Harvey_Korman \"Harvey Korman\"), meanwhile, did not reprise their\nroles either, resulting in their characters (Eunice and Ed Higgins) being\nwritten out as having moved to [Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\").\n\nTo fill the void left by Mama's grandchildren, [Allan\nKayser](/wiki/Allan_Kayser \"Allan Kayser\") was cast as Thelma's delinquent\nteenage grandson Mitchel \"Bubba\" Higgins. Bubba was the son of Ed and Eunice.\nBubba was ordered to live with his grandmother after being released from\njuvenile hall and placed on probation. Also added to the cast was [Beverly\nArcher](/wiki/Beverly_Archer \"Beverly Archer\"), who played the new character\nof Iola Boylen, the family's prissy neighbor and Mama's best friend. Her\ncatchphrase was calling out \"Knock, knock!\" in place of ringing the doorbell.\n\nThe second life of the show saw far less bickering than in its first life and\nparticularly \"The Family\" sketches. The Naomi and Vinton characters became far\nless [assertive](/wiki/Assertive \"Assertive\") and more dimwitted, and Mama was\nrepresented as more overpowering throughout the show's syndicated run. A\nrecurring theme throughout the fifth season was Naomi's desire to become a\nmother, and the penultimate season concluded with Naomi's announcement that\nshe was pregnant. Preparation for the baby became a central theme of the sixth\nand final season.\n\n### Absence of Carol Burnett as the \"Eunice\"\ncharacter[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Absence of Carol Burnett as the \"Eunice\" character\")]\n\nAccording to Lawrence's [autobiography](/wiki/Autobiography \"Autobiography\"),\n_Vicki!: The True-Life Adventures of Miss Fireball_ , Burnett resented\nLawrence for accepting the role of Mama for first-run syndication. It was\nduring this time that Burnett was involved in an acrimonious divorce with _The\nCarol Burnett Show_ and _Mama 's Family_ producer [Joe\nHamilton](/wiki/Joe_Hamilton_\\(producer\\) \"Joe Hamilton \\(producer\\)\").[12]\nBurnett felt Lawrence had been disloyal to her and held a grudge against her\nuntil Hamilton's death in 1991. By the time of Hamilton's death, Burnett and\nLawrence had reconciled. Lawrence's autobiography reads:\n\n“ | A funny thing happened the day I signed with Lorimar. Carol called and said, 'I think I'd like to put together maybe a little syndicated show with the family characters. I'll do Eunice, you do Mama. Doesn't that sound like fun?' I said, 'It does, but I just signed with Lorimar to do Mama's Family for Joe.' It became a very abrupt conversation, and Carol hung up. I then went to Al and asked him what he made of the whole thing. He agreed it was really weird. I wondered if I was about to get caught in the middle of yet another struggle between the two of them . . . During her divorce, Carol and I went through a 'cool' period. She 'divorced' everyone and remained distant for a lot of years. She called the house a few years ago. I was standing at the sink peeling carrots, fifteen feet from the phone, but Garrett got to it first and I only heard his half of the following conversation: 'Hello? Oh hi. Yeah, sure, he's in the other room, on the other line. You want me to tell him you're calling? My mom's here, you want to talk to her? No? Okay. Goodbye.' When he hung up I asked him who it was. 'Carol Burnett.' I was shocked. 'What did she say?' 'She didn't want to talk to you. She only wanted to talk to Dad.' Al called her back later that night, made a point of telling her how much we missed and loved her, and she told him, 'I'll be back. It's just going to take a while longer. Give me another year or so.\"[13] | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \n### Series\nend[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Series end\")]\n\nAfter _Mama 's Family_ was picked up in first-run syndication, ratings for the\nseries improved, becoming the highest-rated first-run program in\nsyndication.[14] Despite the show's success, Lawrence did not sign on for\nfurther seasons after completing her four-season contract in first-run\nsyndication. According to Ken Berry (who played Mama's son, Vinton Harper),\nLawrence had seemingly tired of playing the \"Mama\" role by 1990 and wanted to\nend the show.[15] According to Lawrence, who would reprise the Mama role on\nstage for many years thereafter, the series ended because the series had\nreached the standard threshold of [100 episodes](/wiki/100_episodes \"100\nepisodes\") and no longer needed to produce any more.[16] The [series\nfinale](/wiki/Series_finale \"Series finale\") featured Naomi giving birth to a\nbaby girl, who was named Tiffany Thelma.\n\n## Cast and\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Cast and characters\")]\n\n### Thelma Mae Crowley Harper\n(Mama)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Thelma Mae Crowley Harper \\(Mama\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Thelma Harper](/wiki/Thelma_Harper \"Thelma Harper\")\n\n#### Role[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Role\")]\n\nThelma Harper, also known as Mama, is the [title character](/wiki/Title_role\n\"Title role\")/[main character](/wiki/Protagonist \"Protagonist\") of _Mama 's\nFamily_. Despite the title of \"Mama,\" few characters in the sitcom actually\nrefer to Thelma as Mama. In actuality, Thelma plays miscellaneous roles in the\nseries, including grandmother, mother-in-law, sister, neighbor friend, and\nmother dependent on the supporting character in question.\n\nThelma is the widowed matriarch of a rural,\n[Southern](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\") family.[17]\nShe is a country elderly woman in her mid-to-late 60s, who speaks in a\nsouthern [drawl](/wiki/Drawl \"Drawl\").[6] Always active in the housework and\nnurturance of her family, Mama is usually seen cooking, cleaning, and\nproviding loving support to her family.\n\n####\nAppearance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Appearance\")]\n\nMama's appearance is based on that of a stereotypical elderly woman. She is a\nbuxom, purse-lipped widow with silvery blue curls. All of her daytime outfits\nwere short-sleeved, floral-print dresses that carried lace collars. Costumer\n[Ret Turner](/wiki/Ret_Turner \"Ret Turner\") color-coded Mama in lavender.[18]\nAs much of Mama's time was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often\nworn with an overlapping [apron](/wiki/Apron \"Apron\"). Mama's lower legs were\nalways clasped by visible support hose (a feature that was nonexistent during\n\"The Family\" sketches and the _Eunice_ movie).[19] For\n[footwear](/wiki/Footwear \"Footwear\"), Mama invariably wore white, orthopedic\nshoes of a [high heeled](/wiki/High-heeled_footwear \"High-heeled footwear\")\n[brogue](/wiki/Brogue_shoe \"Brogue shoe\") style.[20]\n\nMama invariably wore a few [fashion accessories](/wiki/Fashion_accessory\n\"Fashion accessory\"): a white pearl necklace and white pearl earrings.\n\nMama's outerwear always consisted of the same purple sweater, worn casually,\ndraped over her shoulders without arms in the sleeves; inconstant floral\n[headpieces](/wiki/Headpiece \"Headpiece\"); and a white purse, which she didn't\nhesitate to use as a weapon when given the opportunity.\n\n#### Persona\nevolution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Persona evolution\")]\n\nIn contrast to her more stereotypically elderly, dependent, invariably\nspiteful and cantankerous character on \"The Family\" skits, Mama's hostilities\nare significantly toned down by the sitcom's first life. Though still\ncantankerous in the sitcom's first life, Mama's character expanded with\nwisecracks and humor; pesky antics;\n[unseemliness](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unseemly \"wikt:unseemly\") and\n[naivete](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/na%C3%AFve \"wikt:naïve\"). Mama's\nunseemliness and naivete were exemplified by her inability to drive (episode\n\"[Mama Learns to\nDrive](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_2_\\(1983–84\\) \"List of\nMama's Family episodes\")\"); inability to act in socially acceptable ways out\nin public and in the presence of guests (episodes \"[The Mama Who Came to\nDinner](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_2_\\(1983–84\\) \"List of\nMama's Family episodes\")\", \"[Country\nClub](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_2_\\(1983–84\\) \"List of\nMama's Family episodes\")\" and \"[Ellen's\nBoyfriend](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_2_\\(1983–84\\) \"List\nof Mama's Family episodes\")\"); inability to work jobs outside of the home\n(episodes \"[Mama Gets a\nJob](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_1_\\(1983\\) \"List of Mama's\nFamily episodes\")\",\n\"[Supermarket](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_2_\\(1983–84\\)\n\"List of Mama's Family episodes\")\" and \"[Mama for\nMayor](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_2_\\(1983–84\\) \"List of\nMama's Family episodes\")\"); etc. These characteristics often resulted in the\nhumiliation or frustration of her loved ones.\n\nBy the show's second life, Mama was no longer naive (rather, Vinton\noverwhelmingly assumed this role) and far more capable of high spirits than\never before. This version of Mama had the least amount of stereotypically\nelderly traits. Rather conversely, Mama was dutiful in caring for her home,\ngarden and family; independent; and active in the community along with best\nfriend Iola Boylen. For example, Mama returned to high school and graduated\n(episodes \"[Educating\nMama](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_4_\\(1987–88\\) \"List of\nMama's Family episodes\")\" and \"[Pomp and\nCircumstance](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_4_\\(1987–88\\)\n\"List of Mama's Family episodes\")\"); Mama was heavily involved in the Church\nLadies League and at one point, its president (episode \"[Where There's\nSmoke](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_3_\\(1986–87\\) \"List of\nMama's Family episodes\")\"); Mama participated in dirty dancing (episode \"[Very\nDirty Dancing](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_5_\\(1988/89\\)\n\"List of Mama's Family episodes\")\"); Mama went on a trip (episode \"[Mama Goes\nHawaiian](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_4_\\(1987–88\\) \"List of\nMama's Family episodes\")\"), etc. Highlighting her much more relaxed nature\nduring the syndicated seasons, Mama's main character trait during this time\nwas her many fretful wisecracks typically made in high-pitched, whiny vocal\nqualities. Despite that, this era of Mama was also very rough, abrasive and\nbrash in manner; volatile and explosive in temper; and smart-mouthed with a\nproneness for making snappy retorts.[6]\n\nUnlike the precedent sketch comedy and television movie, Thelma had many\nlocutions on the program, _\" Good Lord!\"_ being her most frequently used. She\noccasionally stated this in alternate ways, such as _\" Good Lord in heaven!\"_\n_\" Good heavens!\"_ or _\" Good night Louise!\"_ Among some of Thelma's\nadditional locutions on the series include: _\" Hell's bells!\"_ _\" The hell you\nsay,\"_ _\" Now hear this,\"_ _\" God-awful,\"_ _\" In a pig's eye!\"_ _\" Shoot!\"_ _\"\nFor crying out loud!\"_ _\" For heaven's sake!\"_ _\" Real good!\"_ (sarcastically)\netc. Disparaging and impudent, Thelma had a series of name-calling\n[catchphrases](/wiki/Catchphrase \"Catchphrase\") she often used to refer to\ncertain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as _\" Nitwit,\"_\n_\" Dimwit,\"_ _\" Goon,\"_ _\" Goober goon,\"_ _\" Lamebrain,\"_ _\" Dunce,\"_ _\"\nTramp,\"_ _\" Floozy,\"_ etc.\n\n#### Vicki Lawrence on evolution of\nMama[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Vicki Lawrence on evolution of Mama\")]\n\nVicki Lawrence has stated that at the beginning of _Mama 's Family_, she\ndetected that the writers had made adjustments to her character from \"The\nFamily\" skits, significantly toning down Mama's hostilities and nastiness.\nLawrence originally disfavored Mama's change in character from \"The Family\"\nsketches to the series version, believing that toning down the character's\nthen-familiar aggression and spite in exchange for a less difficult, more\nagreeable nature, capable of humor and high spirits, wasn't funny.\n\nLawrence has revealed, however, that after counsel that the character needed\nto be reshaped for sitcom television from Harvey Korman, she came to accept\nthe adjustments made to \"Mama.\" Korman informed Lawrence that Mama had to be\nless one-dimensionally hostile since the entire show would revolve around\nher—that more characteristics would need to be added into the mix. Korman also\ninformed her that you can't expect people to come home from work, pop a beer,\nand put up their feet to a character that's so one-dimensional. He informed\nher that the character would have to be more than just disagreeable for a\nwhole half hour otherwise viewers would get bored. According to Korman, silly\nelements would need to be added to the character.\n\nLawrence has stated that it took her a while to warm up to this, but that she\nlater came to greatly appreciate how Mama \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from her\nearly years on \"The Family\". She added that she still favors the adjustments\nin Mama's character and has credited who Thelma Harper is today partly to\nKorman. \"The Family\" sketch writers, however, who based \"The Family\"\ncharacters on their real-life family members, disfavored the less aggressive\nMama. In February 2013, Lawrence remarked that \"The Family\" sketch version of\nMama was created by writers who hated their mothers.[2][21][22]\n\n### Family members and\nfriends[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit\nsection: Family members and friends\")]\n\nSee also: [List of Mama's Family\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters \"List of Mama's Family\ncharacters\")\n\nCharacter | Actor | Years | character rank | Description  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**[Vinton Harper](/wiki/Vinton_Harper \"Vinton Harper\")** | [Ken Berry](/wiki/Ken_Berry \"Ken Berry\") | 1983–1984  \n1986–1990 | Supporting character | The youngest of Thelma's three children. Dopey, buffoonish, and accident prone, Vint regularly makes a fool out of himself, particularly when he attempts to be assertive or knowledgeable.[6] Works at Kwik Keys as a [locksmith](/wiki/Locksmith \"Locksmith\"). Vinton was color-coded in tan in a short-sleeved button-down shirt and pants.[18]  \n**[Naomi Oates Harper](/wiki/Naomi_Harper \"Naomi Harper\")** | [Dorothy Lyman](/wiki/Dorothy_Lyman \"Dorothy Lyman\") | 1983–1984  \n1986–1990 | Supporting character | Vinton's lascivious, demonstrative, and maritally flirtatious second wife, who is often at odds with Thelma over his loyalty, also in part for her salaciousness.[6] Naomi works as a checker (later becoming the assistant manager) at Food Circus, a local supermarket. Vinton's nickname for her is \"Skeeter\" while Mama's nickname for her is \"tramp.\" While Naomi had straight hair in the first life of the sitcom, she had curls by the show's second life. Naomi was color-coded in yellow-colored, off-the-shoulder or [strapless dresses](/wiki/Strapless_dress \"Strapless dress\"),[18] which Thelma often referred to as \"gaudy.\"  \n**[Vinton\"Buzz\" Harper, Jr.](/wiki/Vinton_%22Buzz%22_Harper,_Jr. \"Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper, Jr.\")** | [Eric Brown](/wiki/Eric_Brown_\\(actor\\) \"Eric Brown \\(actor\\)\") | 1983–1984 | Supporting character | Vint's teenage son with his first wife, Mitzi. Buzz is very cheerful, spirited, patient, and obliging. Buzz was last mentioned in \"Farewell Frannie\", and subsequently [retconned](/wiki/Retcon \"Retcon\") as never to have existed.  \n**[Sonja Harper](/wiki/Sonja_Harper \"Sonja Harper\")** | [Karin Argoud](/wiki/Karin_Argoud \"Karin Argoud\") | 1983–1984 | Supporting character | Vint's teenage daughter with his first wife, Mitzi. Sonja starts out moody, whiny, lazy, and rather oblivious, but later becomes interested in boys and blossoms into a young lady interested in civic affairs. Like her brother, she later moved out, presumably going off to college. She was also crowned Miss Rayteen 1984 during the second season of the show's run. Sonja was last mentioned in \"Farewell Frannie\", and subsequently [retconned](/wiki/Retcon \"Retcon\") as never to have existed.  \n**[Ellen Harper-Jackson](/wiki/Ellen_Harper \"Ellen Harper\")** | [Betty White](/wiki/Betty_White \"Betty White\") | 1983–1984  \n1986 | Recurring character | The eldest of Thelma's three children. Ellen is a pretentious social elitist, who often avoids fraternizing with the rest of the family, unless it suits her purpose. Her birthday is June 30.  \n**[Eunice Harper Higgins](/wiki/Eunice_Harper_Higgins \"Eunice Harper Higgins\")** | [Carol Burnett](/wiki/Carol_Burnett \"Carol Burnett\") | 1983–1984 | Recurring character | The second of Thelma's three children. Seemingly never changing her outfit and always layered in tattered, raggedy green rags, Eunice is extremely tempestuous, antagonistic, and quarrelsome, constantly bickering with everyone in the family (especially her mother). Her birthday is December 19.  \n**[Ed Higgins](/wiki/Ed_Higgins \"Ed Higgins\")** | [Harvey Korman](/wiki/Harvey_Korman \"Harvey Korman\") | 1983–1984 | Recurring character | Eunice's mild mannered, browbeaten husband. The Ed character was toned down from his appearances in \"The Family\" sketches, formerly a fiercely ill-tempered man that had no qualms with regularly quarreling with his mother-in-law and Eunice, at one point even permanently up and leaving Eunice. In _Mama 's Family_, however, the two remained married.  \n**[Bubba Higgins](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Bubba_Higgins \"List of Mama's Family characters\")** | [Allan Kayser](/wiki/Allan_Kayser \"Allan Kayser\") | 1986–1990 | Supporting character | Ed and Eunice's teenage son who is forced to live with Thelma upon being released from juvenile hall, after his parents had moved to Florida. Although initially depicted as a frisky, hyperactive, and eccentric teen with a penchant for playing instruments along with friends Dwayne and T-Boy, he over time evolved into a calm, mature, and commonsensical teen, though still with a robust interest in the opposite sex. The character always wore extremely tight-fitting jeans and in the early going suspenders as well. This later progressed into tight-fitting jeans and conservative sweatshirts.[6] Bubba was color-coded in green.[18]  \n**[Frances Marie Crowley](/wiki/Fran_Crowley \"Fran Crowley\")** | [Rue McClanahan](/wiki/Rue_McClanahan \"Rue McClanahan\") | 1983–1984 | Supporting character | Thelma's younger uncomfortable and uptight spinster sister. Works as a newspaper reporter and free-lance writer. She later died by choking on a toothpick at the Bigger Jigger. McClanahan was unhappy with the role.[23]  \n**[Iola Lucille Boylen](/wiki/Iola_Boylan \"Iola Boylan\")** | [Beverly Archer](/wiki/Beverly_Archer \"Beverly Archer\") | 1986–1990 | Supporting character | The Harpers’ well-meaning but obnoxious, nice, chipper, quirky, and prissy neighbor. She is a spinster like Thelma's sister Frannie. Among her quirks, she constantly bestows the family with peculiar [handicraft](/wiki/Handicraft \"Handicraft\") items, predominately wears pink, and calls \"knock knock\" upon her every entrance. During her first appearances on the show, a running gag existed that saw her having loopy temper tantrums at odd intervals, described as \"spells\". She lives with her overbearing and aging parents, whom she seeks to escape by spending as much time at Thelma's home as possible. Iola is best friends with Thelma (her only friend). In her first couple of seasons, she was secretly infatuated with Vint; the two had known each other since their youth, which caused her and Naomi to have an adversarial relationship. Iola was color-coded in pink, usually [gingham](/wiki/Gingham \"Gingham\"), [shirtwaist dresses](/wiki/Shirtdress \"Shirtdress\").[18]  \n  \n## Harper family\ntree[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: Harper family tree\")]\n\n|  |  |  | Grandma Crowley* |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | unknown parents  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n|  | Frances Crowley |  | Thelma Crowley |  | Carl Harper |  | Effie Harper |  | Roy Harper  \n|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \nBruce Jackson (div.) |  | Ellen Harper |  | Eunice Harper |  | Ed Higgins |  | Vinton Harper |  | Naomi Oates |  | Leonard Oates (div.) |  |  | Mitzi (div.)  \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |   \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Bubba Higgins |  |  |  |  |  | Tiffany Thelma Harper |  | Sonja Harper |  | Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper, Jr. |  |   \n  \n  * Magenta = Crowleys\n  * Orange = Harpers\n  * Blue = Harper children\n  * Red = Harper in-laws\n  * Green = Harper grandchildren\n\n*Note: Thelma's mother was shown on two occasions on the show (once in a flashback and once as a ghost, played both times by Vicki Lawrence), but her name was never revealed.

While he's occasionally made mention of especially by Thelma, he only appears in flashback episodes. Though even in flashbacks, he's unseen for the most part, as he's usually only portrayed in voice as a man who spent the vast majority of his life nested on the [toilet](/wiki/Toilet \"Toilet\") in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, Carl died on the toilet. He's characterized as a grouch who screams from the bathroom about how he doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n  * **Effie Crowley Harper** , Thelma's cousin (in season 2) and later her sister-in-law (in season 4).

Played by Jennifer Richards. She is only seen once but mentioned several times.\n  * **Mr. and Mrs. Boylen** , Iola's elderly, predominately unseen parents, who live across the street from Thelma. Not much is mentioned of her father, while her mother is often alluded to as a grotesquely large, temperamental, T.V.-watching [invalid](/wiki/Disability \"Disability\"). The two characters are largely unseen; however, Mama once called out a greeting to an elderly woman, living next to her, she referred to as \"Ms. Boylen.\" This was a brief moment from the episode \"Mama Learns To Drive,\" from the show's first life (season 2), prior to the appearances of Iola.\n  * **Roselle Huplander** , an obese associate of Thelma and Iola who is never seen. On a few occasions Thelma has spoken to her over the phone but more often, she is gossiped about by Thelma and Iola.

She first appeared in the first life of the show (episode \"[Mama's Birthday](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_2_\\(1983–84\\) \"List of Mama's Family episodes\")\") as a buxom elderly woman with a surly nature. In this appearance, she spoke to a middle-aged Thelma over the phone. The conversation ended with Grandma Crowley hanging up on Thelma, following Thelma's resentful protests against Grandma Crowley's contemptuous remarks about her husband, Carl. Grandma Crowley's second appearance was in the show's second life (episode \"[My Mama, Myself](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_5_\\(1988/89\\) \"List of Mama's Family episodes\")\"). In this appearance, Grandma Crowley appeared as a slender ghost, haunting Mama. Taking on a menacing, overbearing, and harassing nature, she spent the entirety of the episode relentlessly criticizing, insulting, and ordering Thelma around. On more than one episode of the show's second life, Thelma alluded to having to possess forbearance in dealing with her mother's harassingly censorious nature growing up. For example, in the episode \"[Mama Makes Three](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_2_\\(1983–84\\) \"List of Mama's Family episodes\"),\" Thelma visited a psychiatrist with Vinton and Naomi. During the session, she began ranting and raving about her childhood and her mother, even referring to Grandma Crowley as a \"prune-face old harpy.\" Vinton has also described Grandma Crowley as being \"mean\" in her treatment of him, Eunice, and Ellen when they were all children.\n  * **Church Ladies League** , also known as **CLL**.

She listed Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, Betty White, Ken Berry and Dorothy Lyman. Admiring the episode, Lawrence remarked \"How much help does one girl get?\" and \"It's just an amazing supporting cast. Dear God, Carol was funny in that show!\"[21]\n  * Lawrence has stated that another favorite of hers from the early seasons is the episode \"[Rashomama](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_2_\\(1983–84\\) \"List of Mama's Family episodes\").\" Lawrence revealed that \"Rashomama\" is a takeoff of the Japanese film \"[Rashomon](/wiki/Rashomon \"Rashomon\").\" She explained that the episode is about Mama getting hit with a kettle in the kitchen and it is her, Betty, Dorothy, and Carol. At the emergency room, the three of them each have a different version of what happened to Mama. Lawrence explained, \". . . we redo the scene three different ways, and it's pretty funny.\"[21]\n  * As other episode favorites, Lawrence has named \"[Family Feud](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_1_\\(1983\\) \"List of Mama's Family episodes\")\" and \"[Mama on Jeopardy!](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_4_\\(1987–88\\) \"List of Mama's Family episodes\")\" Lawrence stated to loving this dysfunctional family getting sent out into the real world. In particular, she stated to loving this when [game shows](/wiki/Game_show \"Game show\") were involved because \". . . people know the format of these shows so perfectly, and to watch this crazy family get stuck in that format was really fun to me. Probably because I also love game shows so much.\" [21]\n  * As another episode favorite, Lawrence named \"[The Love Letter](/wiki/List_of_Mama%27s_Family_episodes#Season_3_\\(1986–87\\) \"List of Mama's Family episodes\").\" Stated Lawrence, \"It was a great episode, a record-holder actually. I think Bubba writes a love letter for Vint, who is having some problems with Naomi. In the course of the 22 minute episode, everybody thinks that the love letter is meant for them. Mama thinks it is for her from the repair guy who is there. Iola is sure Vint has written it to her. The show actually ran 22 minutes with no costume changes or anything. I remember the night that we did it. We did it in 22 minutes and were out at 7:25, and our director said 'good night, you're done!'\" Lawrence added \"Honestly, I have to say, by the time we finished the show, we had it down to a four day workweek, so I kind of felt like we got paid to play dress up really.\"[21]\n\n## Ratings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Ratings\")]\n\n  * Season 1: #22\n  * Season 2: #59\n\n## DVD\nreleases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mama%27s_Family&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: DVD releases\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/Mama%27s_Family.jpg/190px-\nMama%27s_Family.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mama%27s_Family.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mama%27s_Family.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDVD Cover Art\n\nDVD information  \n---  \n**Mama 's Family—The Complete First Season**\n\n  * Release date: September 26, 2006\n  * Studio: [Warner Home Video](/wiki/Warner_Home_Video \"Warner Home Video\")\n\n  \n  \nOn September 26, 2006, [Warner Bros.
