        "# England at the FIFA World Cup\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nThe [England national football team](/wiki/England_national_football_team\n\"England national football team\") has competed at the [FIFA World\nCup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup \"FIFA World Cup\") since 1950. The FIFA World Cup is\nthe premier competitive international football tournament, first played in\n[1930](/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup \"1930 FIFA World Cup\"), whose finals stage\nhas been held every four years since, except [1942 and\n1946](/wiki/History_of_the_FIFA_World_Cup#Cancellations_due_to_World_War\n\"History of the FIFA World Cup\"), due to the [Second World\nWar](/wiki/Second_World_War \"Second World War\").[1]\n\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the [qualification\nphase](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification \"FIFA World Cup qualification\") and\nthe final phase (officially called the _World Cup Finals_). The qualification\nphase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the finals,\nis used to determine which teams qualify for the finals. The current format of\nthe finals involves thirty-two teams competing for the title, at venues within\nthe host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup\nFinals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an\nestimated 715.1 million people watching the [2006\nFinal](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_Final \"2006 FIFA World Cup Final\").[2][3]\n\nEngland did not enter the competition until [1950](/wiki/1950_FIFA_World_Cup\n\"1950 FIFA World Cup\"), but have entered all eighteen subsequent\ntournaments.[a] They have failed to qualify for the finals on three occasions,\n[1974](/wiki/1974_FIFA_World_Cup \"1974 FIFA World Cup\") (West Germany),\n[1978](/wiki/1978_FIFA_World_Cup \"1978 FIFA World Cup\") (Argentina) and\n[1994](/wiki/1994_FIFA_World_Cup \"1994 FIFA World Cup\") (United States), and\nhave failed to advance from the group stages on three occasions; at the [1950\nFIFA World Cup](/wiki/1950_FIFA_World_Cup \"1950 FIFA World Cup\"), the [1958\nFIFA World Cup](/wiki/1958_FIFA_World_Cup \"1958 FIFA World Cup\") and the [2014\nFIFA World Cup](/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup \"2014 FIFA World Cup\"). Their best\never performance is winning the Cup in the [1966](/wiki/1966_FIFA_World_Cup\n\"1966 FIFA World Cup\") tournament held in England, whilst they also finished\nin fourth place in [1990](/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup \"1990 FIFA World Cup\"), in\nItaly, and in [2018](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup \"2018 FIFA World Cup\") in\nRussia. Other than that, the team have reached the quarter-finals on nine\noccasions, the latest of which were at the [2002](/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup\n\"2002 FIFA World Cup\") (South Korea/Japan) and the\n[2006](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup \"2006 FIFA World Cup\") (Germany).[b]\n\nEngland are the only team not representing a [sovereign\nstate](/wiki/Sovereign_state \"Sovereign state\") to win the World Cup, which\nthey did in [1966](/wiki/1966_FIFA_World_Cup \"1966 FIFA World Cup\") when they\nhosted the finals. They defeated [West\nGermany](/wiki/Germany_national_football_team \"Germany national football\nteam\") 4–2 after extra time to win the World Cup title. Since then, they have\ngenerally reached the knockout stages of almost every competition they have\nqualified for, including a fourth-place finish in the 1990 and 2018 World\nCups. At the world cup, England have had more goalless draws than any other\nteam.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Brazil 1950\n      * 1.1.1 1950 Finals\n    * 1.2 Switzerland 1954\n      * 1.2.1 1954 Finals\n    * 1.3 Sweden 1958\n    * 1.4 Chile 1962\n    * 1.5 England 1966\n    * 1.6 Mexico 1970\n    * 1.7 West Germany 1974\n    * 1.8 Argentina 1978\n    * 1.9 Spain 1982\n    * 1.10 Mexico 1986\n    * 1.11 Italy 1990\n    * 1.12 United States 1994\n    * 1.13 France 1998\n    * 1.14 South Korea/Japan 2002\n    * 1.15 Germany 2006\n    * 1.16 South Africa 2010\n    * 1.17 Brazil 2014\n    * 1.18 Russia 2018\n      * 1.18.1 2018 Finals\n  * 2 Records\n    * 2.1 By match\n    * 2.2 By opponent\n  * 3 Players' honours\n    * 3.1 List of England players with the most appearances at World Cups\n    * 3.2 List of England top goalscorers at World Cups\n    * 3.3 List of England goals by tournament\n    * 3.4 List of England players playing abroad at a World Cup\n  * 4 Team awards and records\n  * 5 Refereeing\n  * 6 Notes and references\n    * 6.1 Notes\n    * 6.2 References\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Brazil\n1950[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Brazil 1950\")]\n\nMain article: [1950 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/1950_FIFA_World_Cup \"1950 FIFA World\nCup\")\n\nSee also: [1949–50 British Home\nChampionship](/wiki/1949%E2%80%9350_British_Home_Championship \"1949–50 British\nHome Championship\")\n\nEngland's first qualifying campaign for the FIFA World Cup doubled as the\n[1950 British Home Championship](/wiki/1950_British_Home_Championship \"1950\nBritish Home Championship\"). The series kicked off for England on 15 October\n1949 at [Ninian Park](/wiki/Ninian_Park \"Ninian Park\"),\n[Cardiff](/wiki/Cardiff \"Cardiff\"), against\n[Wales](/wiki/Wales_national_football_team \"Wales national football team\").\n[Stan Mortensen](/wiki/Stan_Mortensen \"Stan Mortensen\") gave England the lead\nafter twenty two minutes, and just seven minutes later, [Jackie\nMilburn](/wiki/Jackie_Milburn \"Jackie Milburn\") doubled the lead. This was the\nfirst goal of Milburn's hat trick, which left England 4–0 up with 20 minutes\nto play. [Mal Griffiths](/wiki/Mal_Griffiths \"Mal Griffiths\") scored a\nconsolation goal for Wales ten minutes from time, but England held on for a\ncomfortable victory.\n\nA month later, England welcomed\n[Ireland](/wiki/Ireland_national_football_team_\\(1882%E2%80%931950\\) \"Ireland\nnational football team \\(1882–1950\\)\") to [Maine Road](/wiki/Maine_Road \"Maine\nRoad\"), and it began well for the home side as [Jack Rowley](/wiki/Jack_Rowley\n\"Jack Rowley\") scored inside six minutes. England were already 6–0 up, thanks\nto [Jack Froggatt](/wiki/Jack_Froggatt \"Jack Froggatt\"), two for [Stan\nPearson](/wiki/Stan_Pearson \"Stan Pearson\"), [Stan\nMortensen](/wiki/Stan_Mortensen \"Stan Mortensen\") and a second from Rowley, by\nthe time Ireland struck back through [Samuel Smyth](/wiki/Samuel_Smyth \"Samuel\nSmyth\") after 55 minutes. Rowley added a third and a fourth to his tally in\nthe three minutes following Smyth's goal, however, leaving the score at 8–1 at\nthe hour mark. The frantic scoring rate calmed down after that, with only one\napeice before the final whistle, with Stan Pearson completing his brace for\nEngland's ninth, and [Bobby Brennan](/wiki/Bobby_Brennan \"Bobby Brennan\")\nscoring for Ireland.\n\nIt was not until May 1950 that England travelled to [Hampden\nPark](/wiki/Hampden_Park \"Hampden Park\") to face\n[Scotland](/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team \"Scotland national football\nteam\"), who were also undefeated after their games against Ireland and Wales.\nWith the top two from the group qualifying, both teams were guaranteed\nprogression to the finals, and the game was solely for the honour of winning\nthe British Home Championship, and the seeding advantage to be enjoyed upon\nreaching Brazil. A solitary goal from [Roy Bentley](/wiki/Roy_Bentley \"Roy\nBentley\") gave England the victory, the title and the top spot in the group.\n\n#### 1950\nFinals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1950 Finals\")]\n\nEngland were seeded in pot one for the finals, which meant they were the\nfavourites to progress from [Group 2](/wiki/1950_FIFA_World_Cup#Group_2 \"1950\nFIFA World Cup\"), which also contained\n[Spain](/wiki/Spain_national_football_team \"Spain national football team\"),\n[Chile](/wiki/Chile_national_football_team \"Chile national football team\") and\nthe [United States](/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team \"United\nStates men's national soccer team\"). England's campaign kicked off against\nChile in [Rio de Janeiro](/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro \"Rio de Janeiro\"), and, as was\nexpected, England cruised to a 2–0 victory, courtesy of goals from [Stan\nMortensen](/wiki/Stan_Mortensen \"Stan Mortensen\") and [Wilf\nMannion](/wiki/Wilf_Mannion \"Wilf Mannion\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nMain article: [United States v England (1950 FIFA World\nCup)](/wiki/United_States_v_England_\\(1950_FIFA_World_Cup\\) \"United States v\nEngland \\(1950 FIFA World Cup\\)\")\n\nTheir troubles began four days later when they faced the Americans in [Belo\nHorizonte](/wiki/Belo_Horizonte \"Belo Horizonte\") in what has become one of\nthe most famous matches of all time. [Joe Gaetjens](/wiki/Joe_Gaetjens \"Joe\nGaetjens\") scored the only goal of the match to give the United States an\nunlikely victory, which has gone down as one of the World Cup's greatest\nupsets. A myth arose that the English newspapers were so confident of an\nEnglish victory that when the result was telegrammed back, they assumed a\nmisprint and printed the score as 10–1 in England's favour. However, this has\nproven to be untrue.[5]\n\nThis left England in a sticky situation prior to their final match, against\nSpain in Rio. They needed to win, and for Chile to beat the United States to\nstand any chance of going through, and even then they would need the goal\naverages to fall in their favour. As it turned out, no such calculations were\nnecessary, despite Chile's victory, as Spain's\n[Zarra](/wiki/Telmo_Zarraonaind%C3%ADa \"Telmo Zarraonaindía\") scored the only\ngoal of the game, eliminating England from the competition.\n\n### Switzerland\n1954[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Switzerland 1954\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-\nnew.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg)|\nThis section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

They played [Wales](/wiki/Wales_national_football_team\n\"Wales national football team\") at [Ninian Park](/wiki/Ninian_Park \"Ninian\nPark\") as their first match once again, and the 4–1 result was the same.\nHowever, unlike four years earlier, it was the home side that went into the\nlead, after twenty two minutes through [Ivor Allchurch](/wiki/Ivor_Allchurch\n\"Ivor Allchurch\"). Despite being 1–0 down at half time, England scored four\nwithin eight minutes of the restart; two each for [Dennis\nWilshaw](/wiki/Dennis_Wilshaw \"Dennis Wilshaw\") and [Nat\nLofthouse](/wiki/Nat_Lofthouse \"Nat Lofthouse\").\n\n[Goodison Park](/wiki/Goodison_Park \"Goodison Park\") was the venue for\nEngland's home clash against Ireland, who were newly renamed [Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_national_football_team \"Northern Ireland\nnational football team\"). [Harold Hassall](/wiki/Harold_Hassall \"Harold\nHassall\") got England off to a good start with a goal after just ten minutes.\nEddie McMorran put the Irish back on terms just before the hour mark, but\nHassall completed his brace six minutes later. Lofthouse completed a\ncomfortable 3–1 win for England.\n\nWith the top two in the group qualifying for the finals, the final game\nbetween England and [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team \"Scotland\nnational football team\"), at [Hampden Park](/wiki/Hampden_Park \"Hampden\nPark\"), settled nothing except the placings within the group, despite Scotland\nhaving dropped a point with a 3–3 draw at home to Wales. [Allan\nBrown](/wiki/Allan_Brown_\\(footballer\\) \"Allan Brown \\(footballer\\)\") put the\nhome side ahead after just seven minutes, but it was all square again thanks\nto [Ivor Broadis](/wiki/Ivor_Broadis \"Ivor Broadis\") just four minutes later.\n[Johnny Nicholls](/wiki/Johnny_Nicholls \"Johnny Nicholls\") gave England the\nlead for the first time just after half time, and they began to extend a lead\nafter [Ronnie Allen](/wiki/Ronnie_Allen \"Ronnie Allen\")'s 68th-minute goal.\n[Jimmy Mullen](/wiki/Jimmy_Mullen_\\(footballer,_born_1923\\) \"Jimmy Mullen\n\\(footballer, born 1923\\)\") made the game all but certain seven minutes from\ntime, and although [Willie Ormond](/wiki/Willie_Ormond \"Willie Ormond\") scored\na consolation for Scotland with just 1 minute to play, England topped the\ncompetition for the second time in a row.\n\n#### 1954\nFinals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 1954 Finals\")]\n\nEngland were drawn in [Group 4](/wiki/1954_FIFA_World_Cup#Group_4 \"1954 FIFA\nWorld Cup\") for the finals, with hosts\n[Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland_national_football_team \"Switzerland national\nfootball team\"), [Italy](/wiki/Italy_national_football_team \"Italy national\nfootball team\") and [Belgium](/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team \"Belgium\nnational football team\"). In an odd twist, unique to the 1954 tournament,\nEngland and Italy, as the two seeded teams in the group, did not have to play\neach other.\n\nEqually, Switzerland and Belgium did not have to play each other. England's\nfirst game in Switzerland was against Belgium in [Basel](/wiki/Basel \"Basel\"),\nand they suffered a shock as [Léopold Anoul](/wiki/L%C3%A9opold_Anoul \"Léopold\nAnoul\") put the Belgians into the lead after just five minutes. Ivor Broadis\nput the favourites back on terms just over twenty minutes later, and although\nNat Lofthouse gave England the lead 10 minutes later, it was proving to be\ntougher than they had expected against the Belgians.\n\nBroadis scored his second just after the hour, but [Henri\nCoppens](/wiki/Henri_Coppens \"Henri Coppens\") hit back four minutes later to\nkeep Belgium in the game at only 3–2 down. Anoul completed his brace another\nfour minutes after that to level the scores again. In another oddity peculiar\nto this World Cup, drawn matches in the group stage would go to extra time,\nand as such the teams played on with the score at 3–3.\n\nJust one minute into the added period, Lofthouse added a fourth for England\nand they seemed to have won it, but [Jimmy Dickinson](/wiki/Jimmy_Dickinson\n\"Jimmy Dickinson\") scored an own goal three minutes later to put the score\nback at 4–4. It stayed this way until the extra period was up, and as penalty\nshoot-outs were yet to be invented and replays were not used in the group, the\nmatch was recorded as a draw.\n\nEngland's second and final group game was against the hosts in\n[Bern](/wiki/Bern \"Bern\"). This proved to be an easier game for the Three\nLions, and they scored one goal in each half (from Jimmy Mullen and Dennis\nWilshaw respectively) to give them a comfortable win of 2–0. As Switzerland\n(against England), Italy (against Switzerland) and Belgium (against Italy) had\nall lost one game, England progressed as group winners, along with\nSwitzerland, who won a play-off against Italy.\n\nEngland faced the winners of group three and defending champions\n[Uruguay](/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team \"Uruguay national football\nteam\") in the [quarter-finals](/wiki/1954_FIFA_World_Cup#Knockout_stage \"1954\nFIFA World Cup\"). [Carlos Borges](/wiki/Carlos_Borges \"Carlos Borges\") gave\nthe South Americans the lead inside 5 minutes, but Lofthouse put England back\non terms ten minutes later. England were clearly struggling, but held on until\njust before half time, when [Obdulio Varela](/wiki/Obdulio_Varela \"Obdulio\nVarela\") gave the lead back Uruguay.\n\n[Juan Alberto Schiaffino](/wiki/Juan_Alberto_Schiaffino \"Juan Alberto\nSchiaffino\") doubled the lead just after the break, but [Tom\nFinney](/wiki/Tom_Finney \"Tom Finney\") kept England's foot in the door with\nhis sixty seventh-minute goal. However, it was all over after [Javier\nAmbrois](/wiki/Javier_Ambrois \"Javier Ambrois\") restored the two-goal lead\nwith twelve minutes to play. The score remained at 4–2, and England were\neliminated from the cup.\n\n### Sweden\n1958[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Sweden 1958\")]\n\nMain article: [1958 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/1958_FIFA_World_Cup \"1958 FIFA World\nCup\")\n\nFor the first time, England had to play against countries other than the Home\nNations to reach the Finals in Sweden. They were drawn against the [Republic\nof Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team \"Republic of\nIreland national football team\") and\n[Denmark](/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team \"Denmark national football\nteam\"). In the qualifying round, England won three out of the four games and\ndrew the other. Four months before the World Cup, [Roger\nByrne](/wiki/Roger_Byrne \"Roger Byrne\"), [Duncan Edwards](/wiki/Duncan_Edwards\n\"Duncan Edwards\"), [David Pegg](/wiki/David_Pegg \"David Pegg\") and [Tommy\nTaylor](/wiki/Tommy_Taylor \"Tommy Taylor\") all lost their lives in the [Munich\nair disaster](/wiki/Munich_air_disaster \"Munich air disaster\") while playing\nfor [Manchester United](/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C. \"Manchester United\nF.C.\"). At the finals, which is the only tournament to have seen all Home\nNations take part, the Home Nations were all drawn in different groups.\n\nEngland were drawn against the [Soviet\nUnion](/wiki/Soviet_Union_national_football_team \"Soviet Union national\nfootball team\") (2–2), [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team \"Brazil\nnational football team\") (0–0) and\n[Austria](/wiki/Austria_national_football_team \"Austria national football\nteam\") (2–2), who finished third in the 1954 World Cup. At the end of the\ngroup stage, Soviet Union and England each had three points, and had scored\nfour goals and conceded four goals. This meant there was a play-off to decide\nthe second-placed team in the group, the winner to qualify. England lost the\nplay-off 1–0 and were thus knocked out. The only consolation for England was\nthat they were the only team to play the eventual winners Brazil and not lose.\n\n### Chile\n1962[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Chile 1962\")]\n\nMain article: [1962 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/1962_FIFA_World_Cup \"1962 FIFA World\nCup\")\n\nThe [third World Cup](/wiki/1962_FIFA_World_Cup \"1962 FIFA World Cup\") which\ntook place in [South America](/wiki/South_America \"South America\"), saw\nEngland qualify by successfully qualifying from the group, which contained\n[Portugal](/wiki/Portugal_national_football_team \"Portugal national football\nteam\") and [Luxembourg](/wiki/Luxembourg_national_football_team \"Luxembourg\nnational football team\"), defeating Luxembourg on both occasions, and\ndefeating Portugal at home, and drawing in [Lisbon](/wiki/Lisbon \"Lisbon\").\n\nAt the finals, England were drawn in a group with\n[Hungary](/wiki/Hungary_national_football_team \"Hungary national football\nteam\"), [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team \"Argentina national\nfootball team\") and [Bulgaria](/wiki/Bulgaria_national_football_team \"Bulgaria\nnational football team\").

Brazil scored first through [Garrincha](/wiki/Garrincha \"Garrincha\"),\nbefore an equaliser for [Gerry Hitchens](/wiki/Gerry_Hitchens \"Gerry\nHitchens\") before half time. However, second-half goals from Garrincha and\n[Vavá](/wiki/Vav%C3%A1 \"Vavá\") meant Brazil won the game 3–1, and eliminated\nEngland from the competition.[8] This defeat was manager [Walter\nWinterbottom](/wiki/Walter_Winterbottom \"Walter Winterbottom\")'s last game in\ncharge.

Each of the matches only saw one goal, with England\ndefeating Romania and Czechoslovakia, and losing to Brazil. The quarter-final\nsaw a repeat of the 1966 final, with England playing West Germany. England\nwere hampered by the fact that first-choice goalkeeper [Gordon\nBanks](/wiki/Gordon_Banks \"Gordon Banks\") was ill, and [Peter\nBonetti](/wiki/Peter_Bonetti \"Peter Bonetti\") played instead.

Poland managed to withstand\nEngland's attacks in the first half, who had Martin Peters playing for them.\nPoland took the lead in the 57th minute with a goal from [Jan\nDomarski](/wiki/Jan_Domarski \"Jan Domarski\").\n\nEngland equalised six minutes later, with a penalty converted by [Allan\nClarke](/wiki/Allan_Clarke_\\(footballer\\) \"Allan Clarke \\(footballer\\)\").\nEngland were unable to score any more goals with goalkeeper [Jan\nTomaszewski](/wiki/Jan_Tomaszewski \"Jan Tomaszewski\") keeping England at bay.\nBrian Clough had previously called Tomaszewski a \"clown\".[10] The commentator\nof the game then said \"it's all over\".[11] Poland took this good form to the\nfinals and ended in third place. After failing to qualify, Alf Ramsey resigned\nfrom his post and after a time, where Ramsey and his predecessor had lasted a\ntotal of 29 years, no manager was able to last in the job for longer than\neight years.

The final group game, however, saw England\nbeat Poland 3–0, which is one of the three highest scores for England at the\nWorld Cup, with [Gary Lineker](/wiki/Gary_Lineker \"Gary Lineker\") scoring a\n[hat-trick](/wiki/Hat-trick \"Hat-trick\").\n\nThis result took England to second place and finished behind Morocco. England\nthen also beat [Paraguay](/wiki/Paraguay_national_football_team \"Paraguay\nnational football team\") 3–0 in the Round of 16. In the quarter-finals,\nEngland renewed their rivalry with Argentina in a game that has become\nnotorious for the Argentina goals, both scored by [Diego\nMaradona](/wiki/Diego_Maradona \"Diego Maradona\"). Maradona's first goal, known\nas the [Hand of God](/wiki/Argentina_v_England_\\(1986_FIFA_World_Cup\\)\n\"Argentina v England \\(1986 FIFA World Cup\\)\"), was illegal and should not\nhave counted, as he used his hand to punch the ball into the net. However, the\nreferee missed this infringement, and ruled that the goal should stand.\nMaradona then made the score 2-0, famously dribbling from inside Argentina's\nhalf and around several English players before scoring. [Gary\nLineker](/wiki/Gary_Lineker \"Gary Lineker\") pulled back the score to 2-1, but\nEngland ran out of time to equalise, and were eliminated. Nevertheless,\nLineker finished with the [Golden\nBoot](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards#Golden_Boot \"FIFA World Cup awards\") by\nscoring six goals and thereby becoming England's first Golden Boot winner.\n\n### Italy\n1990[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Italy 1990\")]\n\nMain article: [1990 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup \"1990 FIFA World\nCup\")\n\nBy winning three and drawing three, [England\nqualified](/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification \"1990 FIFA World Cup\nqualification\") for Italia '90, the second World Cup to be held in Italy,\nscoring ten goals and conceding none. England were unbeaten through\nqualification, winning three games, and drawing the remaining three, but still\nfinished second to Sweden, whom they drew with twice.[16] England profited\nfrom Romania's 3–1 win over Denmark, who, had they won, would have qualified\nas the third-best second-placed team. West Germany and England were able to\nqualify for Italia '90 as the best second-placed teams in the groups with four\nteams.\n\nBecause a few years previously saw English [hooligans](/wiki/Hooliganism\n\"Hooliganism\") at European competition matches, England were forced to play\ntheir group games on [Sardinia](/wiki/Sardinia \"Sardinia\") and\n[Sicily](/wiki/Sicily \"Sicily\").

After opening the tournament with a 1–1 draw against Ireland and a\n0–0 draw against the Dutch, England then beat Egypt 1–0. This was Egypt's\nfirst appearance since the 1934 World Cup.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] England\nwon the group with four points.[17]\n\nIn the [next\nround](/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage#England_vs_Belgium \"1990 FIFA\nWorld Cup knockout stage\"), England had to play Belgium.

Cameroon were the first African team to have\nreached the quarter-finals. England opened the scoring through [David\nPlatt](/wiki/David_Platt_\\(footballer\\) \"David Platt \\(footballer\\)\"), but\nCameroon quickly turned around the game to lead 2-1. Lineker subsequently won\nand scored a penalty in the 83rd minute to ensure the game went to extra time.\nHe then scored a second penalty, to see England reach the semi-finals.[19]\n\nIn the [semi-\nfinals](/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage#West_Germany_vs_England \"1990\nFIFA World Cup knockout stage\"), England met West Germany. There was no\nseparating the two teams after 90 minutes, which made England the first team\nto have played extra time in three successive World Cup games. There was also\nno separating the two teams after extra time, thereby taking the game to\n[penalties](/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_\\(association_football\\) \"Penalty shoot-\nout \\(association football\\)\").[20]\n\nAlthough English goalkeeper [Peter Shilton](/wiki/Peter_Shilton \"Peter\nShilton\") dived the right way for every penalty, he was unable to save any.\nGerman goalkeeper [Bodo Illgner](/wiki/Bodo_Illgner \"Bodo Illgner\"), having\nfailed to save any of England's first three penalties, saved England's fourth\npenalty, taken by [Stuart Pearce](/wiki/Stuart_Pearce \"Stuart Pearce\"). [Olaf\nThon](/wiki/Olaf_Thon \"Olaf Thon\") then scored for Germany, meaning that\nEngland's [Chris Waddle](/wiki/Chris_Waddle \"Chris Waddle\") would have to\nscore his fifth penalty and hope that Shilton saved the Germans' fifth\npenalty. However, Waddle's penalty missed completely, going high over the\ncrossbar, thereby resulting in England's being knocked out of the\ncompetition.[20] The [third-place\nplayoff](/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage#Third-place_play-off \"1990\nFIFA World Cup knockout stage\") between England and Italy saw England lose\ntheir only game of the tournament in normal time.

In a group with six teams,\nEngland lost to [Norway](/wiki/Norway \"Norway\") and [the\nNetherlands](/wiki/Netherlands \"Netherlands\"), finishing third above Poland,\nTurkey and [San Marino](/wiki/San_Marino_national_football_team \"San Marino\nnational football team\").\n\nEngland went into their final game with San Marino knowing they would need a\nseven-goal victory and for Poland to beat the Netherlands in the other match\nin order to qualify.[23] In the game against San Marino, [Davide\nGualtieri](/wiki/Davide_Gualtieri \"Davide Gualtieri\") scored against England\nafter nine seconds, taking the lead for the outsiders. England went on to win\n7–1, which was too small a goal margin. Additionally, despite the half-time\nscore between the Poles and the Dutch being 1-1, the Dutch went on to win 3-1,\nmeaning that however many goals England scored, they could still not qualify.\nTaylor's tenure in charge ended and he was replaced by [Terry\nVenables](/wiki/Terry_Venables \"Terry Venables\"), who was dismissed after\nEngland lost the semi-final of [Euro 1996](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_1996 \"UEFA Euro\n1996\"), hosted in England.[12]\n\n### France\n1998[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: France 1998\")]\n\nMain article: [1998 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/1998_FIFA_World_Cup \"1998 FIFA World\nCup\")\n\nAfter missing out on the World Cup in 1994, England, managed by [Glenn\nHoddle](/wiki/Glenn_Hoddle \"Glenn Hoddle\"), qualified for the World Cup in\nFrance.

England beat Poland, Georgia and Moldova both home and away, but a\nhome defeat to Italy in their fourth match meant they went into the final\nqualifier at the [Stadio Olimpico](/wiki/Stadio_Olimpico \"Stadio Olimpico\") in\nRome just a point ahead of the _Azzurri_ and only needing a draw to qualify\nautomatically; defeat would see them have to navigate a play-off to secure\nqualification. The match finished as a goalless draw and England finished top\nof the group.\n\nAt the finals in France, England played in [Group\nG](/wiki/1998_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_G \"1998 FIFA World Cup Group G\"). England\ndefeated [Tunisia](/wiki/Tunisia_national_football_team \"Tunisia national\nfootball team\") 2–0 in the first game, with goals from [Alan\nShearer](/wiki/Alan_Shearer \"Alan Shearer\") and [Paul\nScholes](/wiki/Paul_Scholes \"Paul Scholes\").[24] Their second match saw\nEngland lose 2–1 to Romania; despite an 81st-minute equaliser from [Michael\nOwen](/wiki/Michael_Owen \"Michael Owen\"), [Dan Petrescu](/wiki/Dan_Petrescu\n\"Dan Petrescu\") scored a winner shortly before injury time. In their final\ngroup game, England defeated [Colombia](/wiki/Colombia_national_football_team\n\"Colombia national football team\") 2–0 in the decisive match, thanks to goals\nfrom midfielders [Darren Anderton](/wiki/Darren_Anderton \"Darren Anderton\")\nand [David Beckham](/wiki/David_Beckham \"David Beckham\").[25] England finished\nsecond in Group G, which saw them qualify for the [last\n16](/wiki/1998_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage \"1998 FIFA World Cup knockout\nstage\") phase, and play the winner of [1998 FIFA World Cup Group\nH](/wiki/1998_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_H \"1998 FIFA World Cup Group H\"),\nArgentina.\n\nIn a fiery game containing six yellow cards and two penalties, [David\nBeckham](/wiki/David_Beckham \"David Beckham\") was controversially sent off in\nthe 47th minute for what many felt was at most a yellow card offence, knocking\nover [Diego Simeone](/wiki/Diego_Simeone \"Diego Simeone\").[26][27] [Gabriel\nBatistuta](/wiki/Gabriel_Batistuta \"Gabriel Batistuta\") opened the scoring\nfrom the penalty spot in the fifth minute of the game, before an equaliser\nalso from the spot by [Alan Shearer](/wiki/Alan_Shearer \"Alan Shearer\") four\nminutes later. England took the lead through Owen, in the 16th minute.\nArgentina drew level through [Javier Zanetti](/wiki/Javier_Zanetti \"Javier\nZanetti\") in injury time of the first half.\n\nThe game finished 2-2, and, as neither team were able to find a winner in\nextra time, penalties were needed to decide the team that qualified to the\nnext round. While [David Seaman](/wiki/David_Seaman \"David Seaman\") did save\none penalty, Argentine goalkeeper [Carlos Roa](/wiki/Carlos_Roa \"Carlos Roa\")\nmanaged to save two, including the vital one from [David\nBatty](/wiki/David_Batty \"David Batty\"), thereby knocking England out of the\nWorld Cup.

Germany, who could only draw 0–0 with Finland, had to play a\nplay-off game against [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine_national_football_team \"Ukraine\nnational football team\"), with England qualifying ahead winning the group.\n\nIn Japan, England had to play against Eriksson's homeland, Sweden, and both\nsettled out for a 1–1 draw.

However, England could only manage a disappointing 0-0 draw against\n[Nigeria](/wiki/Nigeria_national_football_team \"Nigeria national football\nteam\"), meaning that although they were able to qualify for the second round,\nwhere they played Denmark, they qualified as runners up, which meant that they\nwould meet favourites Brazil in the quarter-finals if they qualified.\n\nEngland played Denmark in the [round of\n16](/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage \"2002 FIFA World Cup knockout\nstage\") defeating Denmark 3–0, thanks to goals from Micheal Owen, [Rio\nFerdinand](/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand \"Rio Ferdinand\"), and [Emile\nHeskey](/wiki/Emile_Heskey \"Emile Heskey\").[31] England played four-time World\nCup winners and 1998 runners-up Brazil in the [quarter-\nfinals](/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage#England_vs_Brazil \"2002 FIFA\nWorld Cup knockout stage\").

By winning nine times and only losing to Ukraine, England\nqualified ahead of [Croatia](/wiki/Croatia_national_football_team \"Croatia\nnational football team\"), [Belarus](/wiki/Belarus_national_football_team\n\"Belarus national football team\"),\n[Kazakhstan](/wiki/Kazakhstan_national_football_team \"Kazakhstan national\nfootball team\") and [Andorra](/wiki/Andorra_national_football_team \"Andorra\nnational football team\"). England's group was seen as a favourable one,\ncontaining comparatively much weaker teams.[40] However, England opened up\ntheir campaign with a 1–1 draw against the United States, thanks to a major\nerror by goalkeeper [Robert Green](/wiki/Robert_Green \"Robert Green\"). They\nthen drew 0–0 against [Algeria](/wiki/Algeria_national_football_team \"Algeria\nnational football team\") and were booed off the field by their own fans,\ndrawing the ire of striker [Wayne Rooney](/wiki/Wayne_Rooney \"Wayne\nRooney\").[41] England eventually qualified for the next round by beating\n[Slovenia](/wiki/Slovenia_national_football_team \"Slovenia national football\nteam\") 1–0, but only qualified as runners up to the United States, thereby\nmeaning they would draw favourites Germany.\n\nIn the [second round\nmatch](/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage#Germany_vs_England \"2010 FIFA\nWorld Cup knockout stage\"), Germany took the lead after 20 minutes after\ngoalkeeper [Manuel Neuer](/wiki/Manuel_Neuer \"Manuel Neuer\") played the ball\ndown the pitch to [Miroslav Klose](/wiki/Miroslav_Klose \"Miroslav Klose\"), who\nopened the scoring. The score became 2–0 to Germany after 32 minutes. Shortly\nafter, England defender [Matthew Upson](/wiki/Matthew_Upson \"Matthew Upson\")\nscored a header. Later, [Frank Lampard](/wiki/Frank_Lampard \"Frank Lampard\")\nhad a shot at goal which was disallowed despite crossing the line; which was\nconfirmed on replays. German goalkeeper [Manuel Neuer](/wiki/Manuel_Neuer\n\"Manuel Neuer\") admitted subsequently he knew the ball had crossed the line,\nbut decided to deceive the referee.[42] The German media reported it was\n\"[revenge for Wembley](/wiki/1966_FIFA_World_Cup_Final \"1966 FIFA World Cup\nFinal\")\", while the English media criticised FIFA's refusal to implement goal-\nline technology. Ironically, despite his earlier opposition to [goal-line\ntechnology](/wiki/Video_assistant_referee \"Video assistant referee\"), [Sepp\nBlatter](/wiki/Sepp_Blatter \"Sepp Blatter\") said that it should be introduced\nafter a Ukrainian goal against England at [Euro 2012](/wiki/Euro_2012 \"Euro\n2012\") was ruled out.[43][42][44] As England tried to equalise, Germany used\nthis to their advantage and scored two more goals. This became Germany's\nbiggest win against England in a World Cup, winning 4-1.[45]\n\n### Brazil\n2014[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Brazil 2014\")]\n\nMain article: [2014 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup \"2014 FIFA World\nCup\")\n\nUnder [Roy Hodgson](/wiki/Roy_Hodgson \"Roy Hodgson\"), who replaced Fabio\nCapello after [Euro 2012](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012 \"UEFA Euro 2012\") after a\ndisagreement between Capello and [The FA](/wiki/The_Football_Association \"The\nFootball Association\"), England qualified for the second World Cup to be held\nin Brazil. Ukraine were again one of the opponents in the qualifying rounds.\nThe other opponents included\n[Montenegro](/wiki/Montenegro_national_football_team \"Montenegro national\nfootball team\"), Poland, Moldova and San Marino. After winning six games and\ndrawing four, England qualified unbeaten.[46]\n\nThe draw for the finals saw England have to play against\n[Italy](/wiki/Italy_national_football_team \"Italy national football team\") and\n[Uruguay](/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team \"Uruguay national football\nteam\"), both former world champions, which meant that it was the first ever\ntime three World Champions were drawn in the same group, along with [Costa\nRica](/wiki/Costa_Rica_national_football_team \"Costa Rica national football\nteam\"). England lost to Italy and Uruguay, and were thus knocked out after two\ngames. The final match against Costa Rica finished as a goalless draw. This\nperformance was statistically their worst ever performance at a World Cup,\nending up with just one point after two losses to Uruguay and Italy and a\ngoalless draw with Costa Rica in the [dead rubber](/wiki/Dead_rubber \"Dead\nrubber\") match, their lowest points total in the group stage of a world\ncup.[46]\n\n### Russia\n2018[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Russia 2018\")]\n\nMain article: [2018 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup \"2018 FIFA World\nCup\")\n\nEngland played in [UEFA Group\nF](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_%E2%80%93_UEFA_Group_F \"2018 FIFA\nWorld Cup qualification – UEFA Group F\") in [qualification for the 2018 World\nCup](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification \"2018 FIFA World Cup\nqualification\"), in a group of six with Slovakia, Slovenia, Scotland,\nLithuania and Malta, with only the winner of the group guaranteed\nqualification. England went into the qualification process under manager [Sam\nAllardyce](/wiki/Sam_Allardyce \"Sam Allardyce\"), only for Allardyce to leave\nthe post after just one game due to controversy regarding discussing breaking\nFIFA rules.[47]\n\nUnder Allardyce's replacement, [Gareth Southgate](/wiki/Gareth_Southgate\n\"Gareth Southgate\"), England went undefeated throughout qualification, winning\neight matches out of 10, drawing with Slovenia 0–0 in\n[Ljubljana](/wiki/Ljubljana \"Ljubljana\"), and drawing 2–2 with Scotland in\n[Glasgow](/wiki/Glasgow \"Glasgow\") thanks to a 90th-minute equaliser from\n[Harry Kane](/wiki/Harry_Kane \"Harry Kane\").[48] This was the third successive\nmajor tournament that England were undefeated, having been undefeated in [2014\nWorld Cup](/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_qualifying \"2014 FIFA World Cup\nqualifying\"), and [Euro 2016\nqualifying](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2016_qualifying_Group_E \"UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying\nGroup E\").\n\n#### 2018\nFinals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=England_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: 2018 Finals\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/England_national_team_Russia_2018.jpg/220px-\nEngland_national_team_Russia_2018.jpg)](/wiki/File:England_national_team_Russia_2018.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:England_national_team_Russia_2018.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nEngland national team at the [2018 World Cup](/wiki/2018_World_Cup \"2018 World\nCup\") in Russia\n\nUnder [Gareth Southgate](/wiki/Gareth_Southgate \"Gareth Southgate\"), the\nEngland team began their tournament in [group\nG](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_G \"2018 FIFA World Cup Group G\") against\nTunisia. The game started well for England with a goal from [Harry\nKane](/wiki/Harry_Kane \"Harry Kane\") in the 11th minute. Tunisia equalised\nthrough Sassi from the penalty spot in the 35th minute following a foul by\n[Kyle Walker](/wiki/Kyle_Walker \"Kyle Walker\"). Some controversy followed as\nvarious potential offences against Harry Kane, inside the penalty area were\nignored by the referee and no VAR checks were carried out. England persevered\nand scored a second goal in the 91st minute, again by Harry Kane, resulting in\na [2–1 victory](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_G#Tunisia_vs_England \"2018\nFIFA World Cup Group G\").[49]\n\nIn the second group stage match, England surpassed their record for goals\nscored in a World Cup match by beating [Panama\n6-1](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_G#England_vs_Panama \"2018 FIFA World Cup\nGroup G\"). [Jesse Lingard](/wiki/Jesse_Lingard \"Jesse Lingard\") scored the\nthird goal, [John Stones](/wiki/John_Stones \"John Stones\") scored the first\nand fourth goals and Harry Kane scored a hat-trick with the second, fifth and\nsixth goals.[50]\n\nIn the final group stage match, England narrowly lost 1-0 to Belgium. [Adnan\nJanuzaj](/wiki/Adnan_Januzaj \"Adnan Januzaj\") scored the sole goal of the\ngame; but with both teams having fielded reserve teams, with England\nspecificially making 9 changes. Before the game media outlets stating that a\nloss could potentially become beneficial, as the winner would be in the half\nof the draw with four of the top seven sides in the world.[c][51][52] The\nresult that meant Belgium topped the group and England finished second,\nsetting up a last 16 clash with [Group H](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_H\n\"2018 FIFA World Cup Group H\") winners\n[Colombia](/wiki/Colombia_national_football_team \"Colombia national football\nteam\").[53][54]\n\nEngland played their [last 16\nmatch](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage#Colombia_vs_England \"2018 FIFA\nWorld Cup knockout stage\") in the [Otkritie Arena](/wiki/Otkritie_Arena\n\"Otkritie Arena\"), [Moscow](/wiki/Moscow \"Moscow\"), with the same team as\nagainst Tunisia. Harry Kane scored his sixth goal of the tournament, and the\nthird penalty, after once again being fouled in the box from a corner,\nsimilarly as against Panama.[55] The score remained at 1-0, until stoppage\ntime, where a header from [Yerry Mina](/wiki/Yerry_Mina \"Yerry Mina\") beat\n[Jordan Pickford](/wiki/Jordan_Pickford \"Jordan Pickford\") in goal to bring\nthe game to extra time. Neither team managed to score in extra time, and the\nmatch went to penalties, which England won 4-3.[56] As well as being the first\nknockout match England had won at a major tournament since 2006 (last\ndefeating Ecuador in the last 16); it was the first time England won a World\nCup penalty shoot-out.[d][58] The match was notable for the heated atmosphere\nthe game was played in, with a total of eight yellow cards being shown in the\nmatch.[e][59]\n\nEngland played against Sweden in their [quarter-\nfinal](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage#Sweden_vs_England \"2018 FIFA\nWorld Cup knockout stage\") at [Cosmos Arena](/wiki/Cosmos_Arena \"Cosmos\nArena\"), [Samara](/wiki/Samara \"Samara\") on 7 July 2018.[57] They won the\nmatch 2–0, with defender [Harry Maguire](/wiki/Harry_Maguire \"Harry Maguire\")\nscoring his first England goal, a header scored from a corner, and [Dele\nAlli](/wiki/Dele_Alli \"Dele Alli\") a second header from close range. This\nwould send them through to their third World Cup semi-final and their first\nsince 1990, and third overall.[60] The team played\n[Croatia](/wiki/Croatia_national_football_team \"Croatia national football\nteam\") in the [semi-final](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage#Semi-\nfinals \"2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage\"), resulting in a 2–1 loss after\nextra time.[61] England would later finish fourth in the competition, the best\nresult since [1990](/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup \"1990 FIFA World Cup\"). England\nwould lose again to Belgium in the [3rd place\nplayoff](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage#Third_place_play-off \"2018\nFIFA World Cup knockout stage\"), thanks to goals from [Thomas\nMeunier](/wiki/Thomas_Meunier \"Thomas Meunier\") and [Eden\nHazard](/wiki/Eden_Hazard \"Eden Hazard\"), despite a [Eric\nDier](/wiki/Eric_Dier \"Eric Dier\") shot being cleared off the line
