        "# Clara Edwards\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nFor the composer, see [Clara Edwards\n(composer)](/wiki/Clara_Edwards_\\(composer\\) \"Clara Edwards \\(composer\\)\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Hope_Summers_as_Clara_Edwards.jpg/220px-\nHope_Summers_as_Clara_Edwards.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hope_Summers_as_Clara_Edwards.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hope_Summers_as_Clara_Edwards.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nClara Edwards (Hope Summers).\n\n**Clara Edwards** (originally **Bertha Edwards** , **Bertha Johnson** and then\n**Clara Johnson**) is a [fictional](/wiki/Fiction \"Fiction\") character on the\n[American](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") [television](/wiki/Television\n\"Television\") [sitcom](/wiki/Situation_comedy \"Situation comedy\") _[The Andy\nGriffith Show](/wiki/The_Andy_Griffith_Show \"The Andy Griffith Show\")_ (1960 â€“\n1968). Clara was portrayed by [actress](/wiki/Actress \"Actress\") [Hope\nSummers](/wiki/Hope_Summers \"Hope Summers\").\n\nSummers appeared as Bertha/Clara in 32 episodes of\n[TAGS](/wiki/The_Andy_Griffith_Show \"The Andy Griffith Show\") and was one of\nonly a few characters (the others being [Andy\nTaylor](/wiki/Andy_Taylor_\\(The_Andy_Griffith_Show\\) \"Andy Taylor \\(The Andy\nGriffith Show\\)\"), [Aunt Bee](/wiki/Aunt_Bee \"Aunt Bee\"), and [Opie\nTaylor](/wiki/Opie_Taylor \"Opie Taylor\")) who appeared in all eight seasons of\nthe show's run. The character migrated to the show's [spin-off](/wiki/Spin-\noff_\\(media\\) \"Spin-off \\(media\\)\") series _[Mayberry\nR.F.D.](/wiki/Mayberry_R.F.D. \"Mayberry R.F.D.\")_.\n\n## Overview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Clara_Edwards&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\nClara lives in the fictional community of\n[Mayberry](/wiki/Mayberry,_North_Carolina \"Mayberry, North Carolina\"), [North\nCarolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\") on \"The Andy Griffith Show\"\n(TAGS) and \"Mayberry RFD\". Clara's best friend is her past classmate Aunt Bee.\nThe two women have a warm, yet competitive relationship, which began on a high\nschool basketball team. The kinship would continue with such domestic contests\nas jarring pickles (TAGS, \"[The Pickle Story,\nEpisode#31)](/w/index.php?title=The_Pickle_Story,_Episode&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"The Pickle Story, Episode \\(page does not exist\\)\")\", and planting prize\nroses (TAGS, \"Only a Rose\", Episode #212). In \"The Pickle Story\", TAGS,\nepisode#31, Clara and Bee both compete for a blue ribbon at the county fair\nwith their entries of [pickles](/wiki/Pickled_cucumbers \"Pickled cucumbers\").\nClara wins the ribbon.\n\nClara is a descendant of the town's settlers, and a widow. (However, in\nEpisode 14 of Season 6, she pointedly tells the guest character, Harlan\nRobinson, played by [Woody Chambliss](/wiki/Woodrow_Chambliss \"Woodrow\nChambliss\"), that she is not \"Mrs.\" but \"Miss\" Edwards.) She has a brother\n(who never appears on the show), and an adult nephew Ferdie, who makes one\nappearance. She also has a son, Gale, who never appears on the show. She\noccasionally looks after [Sheriff Andy Taylor](/wiki/Sheriff_Andy_Taylor\n\"Sheriff Andy Taylor\") and son [Opie](/wiki/Opie_Taylor \"Opie Taylor\"), when\ntheir Aunt Bee is out of town.\n\nClara and Bee rival for the attentions of visiting single gentlemen, one of\nwhom is Hubert Saint John, who takes a fancy to Bee as she reminds him of his\nlate wife. When Bee cuts ties, Clara attempts to charm him.\n\nFor a dozen years straight, Clara won Blue Ribons for her pickles at the\nMayberry County Fair, and annoyingly trumps every Mayberry flower contest. She\nis the [organist](/wiki/Organ_\\(music\\) \"Organ \\(music\\)\") at All Souls\nChurch. Along with Bee, she composes a pro Mayberry anthem (\"My Home Town\").\nClara teaches Opie piano, and joins his rock group as pianist/ manager. She,\nBee and friend Myrtle, take a free trip to [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\"). As\na prominent church lady, and later, town council member (\"Mayberry RFD\"), she\nheavyhandedly asserts herself on such matters as parades (\"Mayberry's Float\",\nRFD episode #39), and scorning such locals as Howard (TAGS, \"Howard The\nComedian\", episode #216 and \"The Panel Show\", RFD episode #6), and Millie\n(\"The Church Play\", RFD episode #8).\n\nIn season one of TAGS, the character appeared twice (including Episode #23) as\n\"Bertha Edwards.\" In the second season she became \"Clara Johnson\" and remained\nso until the fifth-season episode \"The Pageant,\" when she morphed into \"Clara\nEdwards.\" She remained Clara Edwards until the end of the series' run. In\nspite of the name changes, the character was the same.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Clara_Edwards&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Aunt Bee](/wiki/Aunt_Bee \"Aunt Bee\")\n  * [Hope Summers](/wiki/Hope_Summers \"Hope Summers\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Clara_Edwards&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  * _The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Series_.
