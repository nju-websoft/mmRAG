Football is a widespread passion\namong the people of [Spain](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\").[1] Football is the sport\nwith the most registered players (a total of 942,674 of which 898,551 are men\nand 44,123 women), and most registered clubs (a total of 20,588) among all\nSpanish sport federations according to data issued by the sports\nadministration of Spain’s government in 2016.[2]\n\nIn a survey of sports habits of the Spanish population made in 2010, football\nwas the second most popular recreational sport practised by the population\n(17.9%). A total of 75.9% of people said they had ever bought tickets to\nattend a football match. In addition, a total of 67.3% of the people said that\nthey saw all, almost all, many, or some of the football matches broadcast on\ntelevision.[3] In another survey made in 2014, the practice of football\ndecreased to 14% of the population, being overtaken by other sports, such as\nrunning, cycling and swimming for recreation. However, in this survey football\nwas still the sport that interests the majority of Spain’s people (48%). A\ntotal of 67% of the population said they were fans or had sympathy for a\nparticular club. In addition, 74.9% said they watched, whenever possible, the\nmatches broadcast on television regarding their favorite teams; and 42.4% had,\nflags, badges or objects of their favorite teams.[4] Data of this survey\nconfirmed the widespread impression that most of Spain’s people are supporters\nof [Real Madrid](/wiki/Real_Madrid \"Real Madrid\") (37.9%) or [FC\nBarcelona](/wiki/FC_Barcelona \"FC Barcelona\") (25.4%), and the other teams\nhave fewer supporters nationwide, as [Atlético de\nMadrid](/wiki/Atl%C3%A9tico_de_Madrid \"Atlético de Madrid\") (16.1%), [Valencia\nCF](/wiki/Valencia_CF \"Valencia CF\") (3.5%), [Athletic\nBilbao](/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao \"Athletic Bilbao\") (3.3.) or [Sevilla\nFC](/wiki/Sevilla_FC \"Sevilla FC\") (3.2%).[4]\n\nA relationship between football, politics, identity and attitudes towards\nregionalism in Spain has also been reported.[1][5][6][7][8]\n\nThe [Royal Spanish Football\nFederation](/wiki/Royal_Spanish_Football_Federation \"Royal Spanish Football\nFederation\") (Spanish: Real Federación Española de Fútbol) is the national\ngoverning body, and it organises two Cup competitions (the [Copa del\nRey](/wiki/Copa_del_Rey \"Copa del Rey\"), and the [Supercopa de\nEspaña](/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa%C3%B1a \"Supercopa de España\")), and the [Spain\nnational football team](/wiki/Spain_national_football_team \"Spain national\nfootball team\"). The _[Liga de Fútbol\nProfesional](/wiki/Liga_de_F%C3%BAtbol_Profesional \"Liga de Fútbol\nProfesional\")_ (LFP) (English: Professional Football League), integrated by a\ntotal of 42 football clubs, forms part of the Royal Spanish Football\nFederation (RFEF) but has autonomy in its organisation and functioning. It is\nresponsible for the organisation of state football leagues, in coordination\nwith RFEF.[9]\n\nThe [Spanish national football team](/wiki/Spain_national_football_team \"Spain\nnational football team\") have won the [FIFA World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup\n\"FIFA World Cup\") once, and has also been successful in the [UEFA European\nChampionship](/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship \"UEFA European Championship\")\nand the [Olympic tournament](/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics \"Football\nat the Summer Olympics\"). The biggest success achieved by the [Spain national\nfootball team](/wiki/Spain_national_football_team \"Spain national football\nteam\") was the historic treble winning three tournaments in a row: [UEFA\nEuropean Championship](/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship \"UEFA European\nChampionship\") in 2008, [FIFA World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup \"FIFA World\nCup\") in 2010, and [UEFA European\nChampionship](/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship \"UEFA European Championship\")\nin 2012.[10][11][12][13] The men's national teams of Spain, in all categories,\nhave won a total of 26 titles in [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA \"FIFA\"), [UEFA](/wiki/UEFA\n\"UEFA\"), and [Olympic](/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics \"Football at the\nSummer Olympics\") tournaments.[14][15]\n\nThe First Division of the [Liga de Fútbol\nProfesional](/wiki/Liga_de_F%C3%BAtbol_Profesional \"Liga de Fútbol\nProfesional\"), commonly known in the English-speaking world as [La\nLiga](/wiki/La_Liga \"La Liga\"), is one of the strongest football leagues in\nboth Europe and the world.[16][17][18] At club level, the Spanish football\nclubs have won a total of 66 international tournaments. [19][20][21][22] They\nare the most successful in different current European competitions, such as\n[UEFA Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League \"UEFA Champions\nLeague\"),[23] [UEFA Super Cup](/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup \"UEFA Super Cup\")\n(shared),[24] and [UEFA Europa League](/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League \"UEFA Europa\nLeague\");[25] and they also were the most successful in the extinct [Inter-\nCities Fairs Cup](/wiki/Inter-Cities_Fairs_Cup \"Inter-Cities Fairs Cup\").[22]\n\nThe characteristic football style of play developed by [FC\nBarcelona](/wiki/FC_Barcelona \"FC Barcelona\"), and later by the [Spanish\nnational football team](/wiki/Spain_national_football_team \"Spain national\nfootball team\") is [Tiki-taka](/wiki/Tiki-taka \"Tiki-taka\"). This football\nstyle is characterised by possessing the ball for large portions of the game,\nmoving the ball quickly from one player to the next, with short and quick\npasses, keeping the ball away from your opponent, and then to deliver that\nkiller pass to score goal.[26][27]\n\nProfessional football in Spain is a sociocultural event that make a\nsignificant contribution to the Spanish economy in terms of both demand and\nsupply. In economic terms, during 2013 professional football generated more\nthan €7.6 billion including direct, indirect and induced effects, representing\n0.75% of Spanish GPD.[28] Moreover, as a result of financial crisis in the\nlast years, many Spanish football clubs in the top two divisions have been\nfacing serious economic troubles due to pay the bank debts. In addition, the\nEuropean Union authorities have warned to Spanish authorities in order to halt\npublic funding of debt-ridden clubs.[29]\n\n[Spain national futsal team](/wiki/Spain_national_futsal_team \"Spain national\nfutsal team\") is one of the strongest teams in the world, being six times\nchampion in the [UEFA Futsal Championship](/wiki/UEFA_Futsal_Championship\n\"UEFA Futsal Championship\"), and two times champion in the [FIFA Futsal World\nChampionship](/wiki/FIFA_Futsal_World_Championship \"FIFA Futsal World\nChampionship\").[15]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Spanish national football team (_La Roja_)\n  * 3 Football club competitions\n  * 4 League (La Liga)\n  * 5 King's Cup (Copa del Rey)\n  * 6 Spanish Supercup (Supercopa de España)\n  * 7 Spanish clubs in international competitions\n  * 8 Women's football\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Further reading\n  * 11 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Football_in_Spain&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nModern football was introduced to Spain in the late 19th century by a\ncombination of mostly British immigrant workers, visiting sailors and Spanish\nstudents coming from Britain.[30][31][32]\n\nThe oldest football clubs in Spain are [Recreativo de\nHuelva](/wiki/Recreativo_de_Huelva \"Recreativo de Huelva\") and [Sevilla\nFC](/wiki/Sevilla_FC \"Sevilla FC\").[33][34][35][36] Although [Gimnàstic de\nTarragona](/wiki/Gimn%C3%A0stic_de_Tarragona \"Gimnàstic de Tarragona\") was\nformed in 1886, the club did not form an actual football team until 1914. The\nfirst official football game played in Spain took place in\n[Seville](/wiki/Seville \"Seville\") on 8 March 1890 at the Tablada Hippodrome.\nSevilla FC played against Recreativo de Huelva. With the exception of two\nSpanish players on the [Huelva](/wiki/Huelva \"Huelva\") team and another two\nplayers on the [Seville](/wiki/Seville \"Seville\") team, all the players on\nboth sides were British. Sevilla FC won 2–0.[31]\n\nIn the [Basque Country](/wiki/Basque_Country_\\(autonomous_community\\) \"Basque\nCountry \\(autonomous community\\)\") during the early 1890s, British shipyard\nworkers and miners formed the [Bilbao Football Club](/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao\n\"Athletic Bilbao\") and [Basque](/wiki/Basque_people \"Basque people\") students\nreturning from Britain founded the [Athletic Club](/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao\n\"Athletic Bilbao\") in 1898.[31][32] This early British influence was reflected\nin the use of English names such as _Recreation Club_ , _Athletic Club_ and\n_Football Club_.[32]\n\nIn Catalonia, which had the most developed industry in Spain, there was an\nimportant British colony. The first games played by Britishmen and Catalan\npeople who had studied in the United Kingdom were documented in 1882 in\n[Barcelona](/wiki/Barcelona \"Barcelona\").[31] However, the first official and\nregistered football club was Palamós FC (Costa Brava, North of Catalonia) in\n1898.[31] The Swiss [Hans Gamper](/wiki/Joan_Gamper \"Joan Gamper\") founded [FC\nBarcelona](/wiki/FC_Barcelona \"FC Barcelona\") on 29 November 1899.[31] Other\nclubs were founded in 1900, such as Sant Andreu, Hispania FC and the Sociedad\nEspañola de Football (one year later the founders changed the name to [Real\nClub Deportivo Español](/wiki/RCD_Espanyol \"RCD Espanyol\")).[31] The [Catalan\nFootball Federation](/wiki/Catalan_Football_Federation \"Catalan Football\nFederation\") (Catalan: _Federació Catalana de Futbol_), responsible for\nadministering football in Catalonia, was the first football association\nfounded in Spain. It was formed on 11 November 1900 as the Football\nAssociation of Catalonia (Catalan: _Football Associació de Catalunya_).[31]\nThe Catalan Football Federation organised the [Catalan football\nchampionship](/wiki/Catalan_football_championship \"Catalan football\nchampionship\") (Catalan: _Campionat de Catalunya_) that was the first football\ncompetition in Spain.[31]\n\nIn [Madrid](/wiki/Madrid \"Madrid\"), the first games were promoted by\n[Institución Libre de\nEnseñanza](/wiki/Instituci%C3%B3n_Libre_de_Ense%C3%B1anza \"Institución Libre\nde Enseñanza\") (ILE) (English: Free Educational Institution), an educational\nand cultural centre. The first club of Madrid was Football Club Sky, founded\nin 1897, but the club separated into two new clubs in 1890. Then, several\nclubs also emerged in Madrid, most notably [_Madrid Football\nClub_](/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F. \"Real Madrid C.F.\"), founded in 1902 by Catalan\nbrothers Juan and Carlos Padrós.[31]\n\nThe [Copa del Rey](/wiki/Copa_del_Rey \"Copa del Rey\") (English: King's Cup)\ncompetition was founded in 1903, one year after a previous football tournament\nnamed Coronation Cup. It was Spain's football national Championship from 1903\nuntil the establishment of the League Championship in 1928.[37]\n\nThe Spanish Federation of Football Clubs was formed in 1909, but there were\ndiscrepancies between the member clubs years later, and some of the clubs\nformed other association called Royal Spanish Union of Clubs of Football.[38]\nFinally, the two associations reached an agreement and the [Royal Spanish\nFootball Federation](/wiki/Royal_Spanish_Football_Federation \"Royal Spanish\nFootball Federation\") was founded in 1913, which allowed the Spanish football\nto enter in [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA \"FIFA\").[39] In these years,\n[Athletic](/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao \"Athletic Bilbao\") was the most dominant club\nin the country, and the first idols in Spain began to appear, like\n[Pichichi](/wiki/Rafael_Moreno_Aranzadi \"Rafael Moreno Aranzadi\") and [Paulino\nAlcántara](/wiki/Paulino_Alc%C3%A1ntara \"Paulino Alcántara\").[39][40][41]\n\nThe [Spain national team](/wiki/Spain_national_football_team \"Spain national\nfootball team\") was created in 1920 on the occasion of the dispute of the\nOlympic Games in [Antwerp](/wiki/Antwerp \"Antwerp\").[32][41] The importance of\nthe success of the Spain national team in the Olympic games, which won the\nsilver medal, was huge in the development of football as mass social event in\nSpain.[41] The interest on football grew, more people attended to the\nstadiums, more informations about football appeared in the newspapers, and\nfootball was used as element of national prestige and political\npropaganda.[42]\n\nAfter the Olympic triumph, football was more popular among Spanish fans, the\nattendances to the stadiums increased, and the pressure of professionalism\ngrew.[43] Spanish football turned professional in 1925.[44] An agreement\nbetween several clubs was made on 23 November 1928 which officially\nestablished Spain's national football division, and the birth of the [Spanish\nLeague](/wiki/La_Liga \"La Liga\"). The first league championship began in\n1929.[32][45]\n\nThe [Spanish Civil War](/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War \"Spanish Civil War\")\n(1936–1939) brought disruption to the national competitions. Although the\nSpanish League was suspended, the Catalan and Valencian clubs continued\ncontesting in the Mediterranean League in early 1937. Barcelona later toured\nMexico and the United States, raising support for the Spanish Republic.[32]\n\nThe Spanish League and the Cup were restored in the 1939–40 season after Civil\nWar had ended. [Francisco Franco’s regime](/wiki/Francoist_Spain \"Francoist\nSpain\"), a fascist political system, began to use football as a propaganda\ntool for the new regime.[46] In 1941, as part of his policy of eradicating\nregional identities, the Franco's regime banned the use of non-Castilian\nnames. As a result, many clubs that had chosen English prefixes previously,\nsuch as Athletic or Football club, had to amend their initial names, for other\nCastilian (as Atlético, or Club de Fútbol). The [Catalan\nChampionship](/wiki/Catalan_football_championship \"Catalan football\nchampionship\") was banned and the Catalan shield taken from FC Barcelona's\nbadge. Spanish football began to rebuild slowly after the War, but Spain's\nisolated international position meant they did not properly re-enter\nInternational football until 1950.[32] Later, Franco's regime was able to use\nthe football, based on the European triumphs of Real Madrid in the 1950s for\npolitical purposes. In this manner, Real Madrid was used as a Spanish brand of\nsuccess to promote Spain’s image abroad, as well as the pride of being Spanish\nin the country itself.[7][47]\n\nSpain was selected as host of the [1982 FIFA World\nCup](/wiki/1982_FIFA_World_Cup \"1982 FIFA World Cup\").\n\nUntil the 1984–85 season, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) was\nresponsible for organizing the league tournament. Since then, the competition\nwas organized by the [Liga de Fútbol\nProfesional](/wiki/Liga_de_F%C3%BAtbol_Profesional \"Liga de Fútbol\nProfesional\") (LFP)(English: Professional Football League), an independent\nbody which was formed at the initiative of the clubs themselves after\ndisagreements with the RFEF regarding the management professionalization and\neconomic division of the League benefits.\n\nSince the entry into force of Spanish Law 10/1990, almost all of the clubs\ncompeting professionally in Spain are actually companies under the legal\nstatus of sports companies, whose ownership is in the hands of its\nshareholders. Only three professional clubs ([Athletic\nClub](/wiki/Atl%C3%A9tico_Madrid \"Atlético Madrid\"), Barcelona and Real\nMadrid) kept its original structure, such as sports clubs directly controlled\nby their members.\n\nAfter the appearance of private television in Spain, football clubs hugely\nincreased its income thanks to the lucrative contracts to broadcast matches on\ntelevision. This allowed them to hire many of the best players in the world,\nbut most of the clubs also increased vastly their spending. In the last years\n[La Liga](/wiki/La_Liga \"La Liga\") is living in a big financial turmoil.\nAlthough the two big powerful clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona, are at the top\nin _[Forbes](/wiki/Forbes \"Forbes\")'_ football rich list, the rest of Spanish\nclubs are weighed down by a colossal debt around €4.1 billion. For this\nreason, most of the clubs had to cut their budgets drastically.[48]\n\n## Spanish national football team (_La\nRoja_)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Football_in_Spain&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Spanish national football team \\(La Roja\\)\")]\n\nMain article: [Spain national football\nteam](/wiki/Spain_national_football_team \"Spain national football team\")\n\nMain article: [List of Spain international\nfootballers](/wiki/List_of_Spain_international_footballers \"List of Spain\ninternational footballers\")\n\nWithin Spain, regional teams, most notably the [football team of\nCatalonia](/wiki/Catalonia_national_football_team \"Catalonia national football\nteam\"), the [football team of Basque\nCountry](/wiki/Basque_Country_national_football_team \"Basque Country national\nfootball team\"), and even the [football team of\nGalicia](/wiki/Galicia_national_football_team \"Galicia national football\nteam\"), began to compete against each other from 1915 onwards. Despite not\nbeing officially recognised by [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA \"FIFA\"), these regional teams\nstill occasionally play friendly games with some national team players playing\nfor both teams. Some autonomous governments and social sectors in the\nhistorical communities (especially in [Catalonia](/wiki/Catalonia \"Catalonia\")\nand [Basque Country](/wiki/Basque_Country_\\(autonomous_community\\) \"Basque\nCountry \\(autonomous community\\)\")) prefer to call their regional teams as\nnational team, while claiming to participate in international tournaments.[49]\n\nThe [Spain national team](/wiki/Spain_national_football_team \"Spain national\nfootball team\"), commonly referred to as _La selección_ (English: The\nselection) or _La Roja_ (English: The Red one), made their international debut\nat the [1920 Olympic Games](/wiki/Football_at_the_1920_Summer_Olympics\n\"Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics\") in Belgium and came away with the\nsilver medal.[32][41] Since then the Spanish national team has participated in\na total of fourteen out twenty [FIFA World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup \"FIFA\nWorld Cup\") and nine out fourteen [UEFA European\nChampionship](/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship \"UEFA European Championship\").\nHistorically, the Spanish national team did not achieve important results, in\nterms of trophies or develop an attractive playing style. Surprisingly, this\nfact contrasted with the huge success obtained by the main Spanish football\nclubs at the European level. Nevertheless, the triumphs of Spanish national\nteam in [2008](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2008 \"UEFA Euro 2008\") and [2012 European\nChampionship](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012 \"UEFA Euro 2012\"), and in [2010 FIFA World\nCup](/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup \"2010 FIFA World Cup\"), with an [attractive\nplaying style](/wiki/Tiki-taka \"Tiki-taka\"), marked a point of inflection that\ndivided the history of Spanish national football team in two parts.\n\nThe Spanish national football team has been the winner of [FIFA Team of\nYear](/wiki/FIFA_World_Ranking \"FIFA World Ranking\") in 2008, 2009, 2010,\n2011, 2012 and 2013, as well as the winner of [Laureus World Sports Award for\nTeam of the Year](/wiki/Laureus_World_Sports_Award_for_Team_of_the_Year\n\"Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year\") in 2011.\n\nThe Spanish national football team have won four trophies in FIFA and\n[UEFA](/wiki/UEFA \"UEFA\") tournaments: one [FIFA World\nCup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup \"FIFA World Cup\") in 2010, and three [UEFA European\nChampionship](/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship \"UEFA European Championship\")\nin 1964, 2008 and 2012. In addition, it was runner-up in the UEFA European\nChampionship in [1984](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_1984 \"UEFA Euro 1984\") and in the [FIFA\nConfederations Cup](/wiki/FIFA_Confederations_Cup \"FIFA
