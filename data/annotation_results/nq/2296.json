She played an angel working for Heaven's overloaded phone\n(prayer) service. She also accompanied the Disko Bay Expedition of [Cape\nFarewell](/wiki/Cape_Farewell,_UK \"Cape Farewell, UK\").[32] On 20 October\n2008, she told [The Canadian Press](/wiki/The_Canadian_Press \"The Canadian\nPress\") that, following the success of her last album, _[The\nReminder](/wiki/The_Reminder \"The Reminder\")_ , she felt she needed to step\naway from the pressures of the music industry to consider her next career move\nand \"rest for a minute\".[33]\n\nIn March 2009, it was announced that she would make a guest appearance on the\ntrack \"You and I\" on [Wilco](/wiki/Wilco \"Wilco\")'s [seventh\nalbum](/wiki/Wilco_\\(The_Album\\) \"Wilco \\(The Album\\)\").[34]\n\nIn 2009, Feist was featured in the [CTV](/wiki/CTV_Television_Network \"CTV\nTelevision Network\") television film \"My Musical Brain\" with neuroscientist\nand writer [Daniel Levitin](/wiki/Daniel_Levitin \"Daniel Levitin\"), based on\nLevitin's bestselling book [This Is Your Brain on\nMusic](/wiki/This_Is_Your_Brain_on_Music \"This Is Your Brain on Music\").\n\nFeist collaborated with Brooklyn band [Grizzly\nBear](/wiki/Grizzly_Bear_\\(Band\\) \"Grizzly Bear \\(Band\\)\") on the song\n\"Service Bell\" for the AIDS charity the [Red Hot\nOrganization](/wiki/Red_Hot_Organization \"Red Hot Organization\").
