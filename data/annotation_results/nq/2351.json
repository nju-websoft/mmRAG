The gradient consists of two parts, the\nchemical gradient, or difference in [solute concentration](/wiki/Concentration\n\"Concentration\") across a membrane, and the electrical gradient, or difference\nin [charge](/wiki/Electric_charge \"Electric charge\") across a membrane. When\nthere are unequal concentrations of an ion across a permeable membrane, the\nion will move across the membrane from the area of higher concentration to the\narea of lower concentration through [simple\ndiffusion](/wiki/Molecular_diffusion \"Molecular diffusion\"). Ions also carry\nan electric charge that forms an [electric potential](/wiki/Electric_potential\n\"Electric potential\") across a membrane. If there is an unequal distribution\nof charges across the membrane, then the difference in electric potential\ngenerates a force that drives ion diffusion until the charges are balanced on\nboth sides of the membrane.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Overview\n  * 2 Chemistry\n  * 3 Biological context\n  * 4 Ion gradients\n  * 5 Proton gradients\n    * 5.1 Bacteriorhodopsin\n    * 5.2 Photophosphorylation\n    * 5.3 Oxidative Phosphorylation\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n\n##\nOverview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electrochemical_gradient&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\nElectrochemical potential is important in [electroanalytical\nchemistry](/wiki/Electroanalytical_chemistry \"Electroanalytical chemistry\")\nand industrial applications such as batteries and fuel cells. It represents\none of the many interchangeable forms of [potential\nenergy](/wiki/Potential_energy \"Potential energy\") through which energy may be\n[conserved](/wiki/Conservation_of_energy \"Conservation of energy\").\n\nIn biological processes, the direction an ion moves by\n[diffusion](/wiki/Diffusion \"Diffusion\") or [active\ntransport](/wiki/Active_transport \"Active transport\") across a membrane is\ndetermined by the electrochemical gradient. In\n[mitochondria](/wiki/Mitochondria \"Mitochondria\") and\n[chloroplasts](/wiki/Chloroplast \"Chloroplast\"), proton gradients are used to\ngenerate a **chemiosmotic potential** that is also known as a **proton motive\nforce**. This potential energy is used for the synthesis of ATP by [oxidative\nphosphorylation](/wiki/Oxidative_phosphorylation \"Oxidative phosphorylation\")\nor [photophosphorylation](/wiki/Photophosphorylation \"Photophosphorylation\"),\nrespectively.[2]\n\nAn electrochemical gradient has two components. First, the electrical\ncomponent is caused by a charge difference across the lipid membrane. Second,\na chemical component is caused by a differential concentration of\n[ions](/wiki/Ions \"Ions\") across the membrane. The combination of these two\nfactors determines the thermodynamically favourable direction for an ion's\nmovement across a membrane.[1][3]\n\nAn electrochemical gradient is analogous to the water\n[pressure](/wiki/Pressure \"Pressure\") across a [hydroelectric\ndam](/wiki/Hydroelectric_dam \"Hydroelectric dam\"). [Membrane transport\nproteins](/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein \"Membrane transport protein\") such\nas the [sodium-potassium pump](/wiki/Sodium-potassium_pump \"Sodium-potassium\npump\") within the membrane are equivalent to turbines that convert the water's\npotential energy to other forms of physical or chemical energy, and the ions\nthat pass through the membrane are equivalent to water that ends up at the\nbottom of the dam. Also, energy can be used to pump water up into the lake\nabove the dam. In similar manner, chemical energy in cells can be used to\ncreate electrochemical gradients.[4][5]\n\n##\nChemistry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electrochemical_gradient&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Chemistry\")]\n\nThe term is typically applied in contexts wherein a [chemical\nreaction](/wiki/Chemical_reaction \"Chemical reaction\") is to take place, such\nas one involving the transfer of an electron at a\n[battery](/wiki/Battery_\\(electricity\\) \"Battery \\(electricity\\)\") electrode.\nIn a battery, an electrochemical potential arising from the movement of ions\nbalances the reaction energy of the electrodes. The maximum voltage that a\nbattery reaction can produce is sometimes called the **standard\nelectrochemical potential** of that reaction (see also [Electrode\npotential](/wiki/Electrode_potential \"Electrode potential\") and [Table of\nstandard electrode potentials](/wiki/Table_of_standard_electrode_potentials\n\"Table of standard electrode potentials\")). In instances pertaining\nspecifically to the movement of electrically charged solutes, the potential is\noften expressed in units of [volts](/wiki/Volt \"Volt\"). See: [Concentration\ncell](/wiki/Concentration_cell \"Concentration cell\").\n\n## Biological\ncontext[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electrochemical_gradient&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Biological context\")]\n\nThe generation of a transmembrane electrical potential through ion movement\nacross a cell membrane drives [biological processes](/wiki/Biological_process\n\"Biological process\") like [nerve](/wiki/Nerve \"Nerve\") conduction, [muscle\ncontraction](/wiki/Muscle_contraction \"Muscle contraction\"),\n[hormone](/wiki/Hormone \"Hormone\") [secretion](/wiki/Secretion \"Secretion\"),\nand [sensory](/wiki/Sensory_system \"Sensory system\") processes. By convention,\na typical animal cell has a transmembrane electrical potential of -50 mV to\n-70 mV inside the cell relative to the outside.[6]\n\nElectrochemical gradients also play a role in establishing proton gradients in\noxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. The final step of cellular\nrespiration is the [electron transport chain](/wiki/Electron_transport_chain\n\"Electron transport chain\"). Four complexes embedded in the inner membrane of\nthe mitochondrion make up the electron transport chain. However, only\ncomplexes I, III, and IV pump protons from the\n[matrix](/wiki/Mitochondrial_matrix \"Mitochondrial matrix\") to the\n[intermembrane space](/wiki/Mitochondrial_intermembrane_space \"Mitochondrial\nintermembrane space\") (IMS). In total, there are ten protons translocated from\nthe matrix to the IMS which generates an electrochemical potential of more\nthan 200mV. This drives the flux of protons back into the matrix through [ATP\nsynthase](/wiki/ATP_synthase \"ATP synthase\") which produces\n[ATP](/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate \"Adenosine triphosphate\") by adding an\ninorganic [phosphate](/wiki/Phosphate \"Phosphate\") to\n[ADP](/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate \"Adenosine diphosphate\").[7] Thus,\ngeneration of a proton electrochemical gradient is crucial for energy\nproduction in mitochondria.[8] The total equation for the electron transport\nchain is:\n\n     N A D H + 11 H + ( m a t r i x ) + 1 / 2 O 2 ⟶ N A D + + 10 H + ( I M S ) + H 2 O {\\displaystyle NADH+11H^{+}(matrix)+1/2\\ O_{2}\\longrightarrow NAD^{+}+10H^{+}(IMS)+H_{2}O} ![{\\\\displaystyle NADH+11H^{+}\\(matrix\\)+1/2\\\\ O_{2}\\\\longrightarrow NAD^{+}+10H^{+}\\(IMS\\)+H_{2}O}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9803a3e718c3e3a39a6171e8af6c707387d7e610)[9]\n\nSimilar to the electron transport chain, the [light-dependent\nreactions](/wiki/Light-dependent_reactions \"Light-dependent reactions\") of\nphotosynthesis pump protons into the [thylakoid](/wiki/Thylakoid \"Thylakoid\")\n[lumen](/wiki/Lumen_\\(anatomy\\) \"Lumen \\(anatomy\\)\") of chloroplasts to drive\nthe synthesis of ATP by ATP synthase. The proton gradient can be generated\nthrough either noncyclic or cyclic photophosphorylation. Of the proteins that\nparticipate in noncyclic photophosphorylation, [photosystem\nII](/wiki/Photosystem_II \"Photosystem II\") (PSII),\n[plastiquinone](/wiki/Plastoquinone \"Plastoquinone\"), and [cytochrome b6f\ncomplex](/wiki/Cytochrome_b6f_complex \"Cytochrome b6f complex\") directly\ncontribute to generating the proton gradient. For each four photons absorbed\nby PSII, eight protons are pumped into the lumen.[10] The total equation for\nphotophosphorylation is shown:\n\n     2 H 2 O + 6 H + ( s t r o m a ) + 2 N A D P + ⟶ O 2 + 8 H + ( l u m e n ) + 2 N A D P H {\\displaystyle 2H_{2}O+6H^{+}(stroma)+2NADP^{+}\\longrightarrow O_{2}+8H^{+}(lumen)+2NADPH} ![{\\\\displaystyle 2H_{2}O+6H^{+}\\(stroma\\)+2NADP^{+}\\\\longrightarrow O_{2}+8H^{+}\\(lumen\\)+2NADPH}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be7a1b2790035685251a3017033df65b136ea6c6)[11]\n\nSeveral other transporters and ion channels play a role in generating a proton\nelectrochemical gradient. One is TPK3, a [potassium\nchannel](/wiki/Potassium_channel \"Potassium channel\") that is activated by\nCa2+ and conducts K+ from the thylakoid lumen to the\n[stroma](/wiki/Stroma_\\(fluid\\) \"Stroma \\(fluid\\)\") which helps establish the\n[pH](/wiki/PH \"PH\") gradient. On the other hand, the electro-neutral K+ efflux\n[antiporter](/wiki/Antiporter \"Antiporter\") (KEA3) transports K+ into the\nthylakoid lumen and H+ into the stroma which helps establish the [electric\nfield](/wiki/Electric_field \"Electric field\").[12]\n\n## Ion\ngradients[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electrochemical_gradient&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Ion gradients\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Scheme_sodium-\npotassium_pump-en-2.svg/220px-Scheme_sodium-potassium_pump-\nen-2.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Scheme_sodium-potassium_pump-en-2.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Scheme_sodium-potassium_pump-en-2.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDiagram of the Na+-K+-ATPase.\n\nSince the ions are charged, they cannot pass through the membrane via simple\ndiffusion. Two different mechanisms can transport the ions across the\nmembrane: [active](/wiki/Active_transport \"Active transport\") or\n[passive](/wiki/Passive_transport \"Passive transport\") transport. An example\nof active transport of ions is the [Na+-K+-ATPase](/wiki/Na%2B/K%2B-ATPase\n\"Na+/K+-ATPase\") (NKA). NKA catalyzes the [hydrolysis](/wiki/Hydrolysis\n\"Hydrolysis\") of ATP into ADP and an inorganic phosphate and for every\nmolecule of ATP hydrolized, three Na+ are transported outside and two K+ are\ntransported inside the cell. This makes the inside of the cell more negative\nthan the outside and more specifically generates a Vm of about -60mV.[5] An\nexample of passive transport is ion fluxes through Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl−\nchannels. These ions tend to move down their concentration gradient. For\nexample, since there is a high concentration of Na+ outside the cell, Na+ will\nflow through the Na+ channel into the cell. Since the electric potential\ninside the cell is negative, the influx of a positive ion depolarizes the\nmembrane which brings the transmembrane electric potential closer to zero.\nHowever, Na+ will continue moving down its concentration gradient as long as\nthe effect of the chemical gradient is greater than the effect of the\nelectrical gradient. Once the effect of both gradients are equal (for Na+ this\nat a Vm of about +70mV), the influx of Na+ stops because the [driving\nforce](/wiki/Reversal_potential \"Reversal potential\") (ΔG) is zero. The\nequation for the driving force is:[13][14]\n\nΔ G = R T l n ( C i n / C o u t ) + Z F V m {\\displaystyle \\Delta\nG=RTln(C_{in}/C_{out})+ZFV_{m}} ![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta\nG=RTln\\(C_{in}/C_{out}\\)+ZFV_{m}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85deffd7530c79ecfbd0934ff07efbb87a2f912e)[6]\n\nIn this equation, R represents the [gas constant](/wiki/Gas_constant \"Gas\nconstant\"), T represents [absolute\ntemperature](/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature \"Thermodynamic temperature\"), Z\nis the ionic charge, and F represents the [Faraday\nconstant](/wiki/Faraday_constant \"Faraday constant\").[15]\n\n## Proton\ngradients[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electrochemical_gradient&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Proton gradients\")]\n\nProton gradients in particular are important in many different types of cells\nas a form of energy storage. The gradient is usually used to drive ATP\nsynthase, [flagellar](/wiki/Flagellum \"Flagellum\") rotation, or transport of\n[metabolites](/wiki/Metabolite \"Metabolite\").[16] This section will focus on\nthree processes that help establish proton gradients in their respective\ncells: [bacteriorhodopsin](/wiki/Bacteriorhodopsin \"Bacteriorhodopsin\") and\nnoncyclic photophosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n###\nBacteriorhodopsin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electrochemical_gradient&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Bacteriorhodopsin\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Bacteriorhodopsin_retinal.png/220px-\nBacteriorhodopsin_retinal.png)](/wiki/File:Bacteriorhodopsin_retinal.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bacteriorhodopsin_retinal.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nDiagram of the conformational shift in retinal that initiates proton pumping\nin bacteriorhodopsin.\n\nThe way bacteriorhodopsin generates a proton gradient in\n[Archaea](/wiki/Archaea \"Archaea\") is through a [proton\npump](/wiki/Proton_pump \"Proton pump\"). The proton pump relies on proton\ncarriers to drive protons from the side of the membrane with a low H+\nconcentration to the side of the membrane with a high H+ concentration. In\nbacteriorhodopsin, the proton pump is activated by absorption of\n[photons](/wiki/Photon \"Photon\") of 568 nm [wavelength](/wiki/Wavelength\n\"Wavelength\") which leads to [isomerization](/wiki/Isomerization\n\"Isomerization\") of the [Schiff base](/wiki/Schiff_base \"Schiff base\") (SB) in\n[retinal](/wiki/Retinal \"Retinal\") forming the K state. This moves SB away\nfrom Asp85 and Asp212, causing H+ transfer from the SB to Asp85 forming the M1\nstate. The protein then shifts to the M2 state by separating Glu204 from\nGlu194 which releases a proton from Glu204 into the external medium. The SB is\n[reprotonated](/wiki/Protonation \"Protonation\") by Asp96 which forms the N\nstate. It is important that the second proton comes from Asp96 since its\n[deprotonated](/wiki/Deprotonation \"Deprotonation\") state is unstable and\nrapidly reprotonated with a proton from the [cytosol](/wiki/Cytosol\n\"Cytosol\"). The protonation of Asp85 and Asp96 causing re-isomerization of the\nSB forming the O state. Finally, bacteriorhodopsin returns to its resting\nstate when Asp85 releases its proton to Glu204.[16][17]\n\n###\nPhotophosphorylation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electrochemical_gradient&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Photophosphorylation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Cyclic_Photophosphorylation.svg/220px-\nCyclic_Photophosphorylation.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Cyclic_Photophosphorylation.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cyclic_Photophosphorylation.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSimplified diagram of photophosphorylation.\n\nPSII also relies on [light](/wiki/Light \"Light\") to drive the formation of\nproton gradients in chloroplasts, however PSII utilizes vectorial redox\nchemistry to achieve this goal. Rather than physically transporting protons\nthrough the protein, reactions requiring the binding of protons will occur on\nthe extracellular side while reactions requiring the release of protons will\noccur on the intracellular side. Absorption of photons of 680 nm wavelength is\nused to excite two electrons in [P680](/wiki/P680 \"P680\") to a higher [energy\nlevel](/wiki/Energy_level \"Energy level\"). These higher energy electrons are\ntransferred to protein-bound plastoquinone (PQA) and then to unbound\nplastoquinone (PQB). This reduces plastoquinone (PQ) to plastoquinol (PQH2)\nwhich is released from PSII after gaining two protons from the stroma. The\nelectrons in P680 are replenished by oxidizing [water](/wiki/Water \"Water\")\nthrough the [oxygen-evolving complex](/wiki/Oxygen-evolving_complex \"Oxygen-\nevolving complex\") (OEC). This results in release of O2 and H+ into the\nlumen.[16] The total reaction is shown:\n\n4 p h o t o n s ( 680 n m ) + 2 H 2 O + 2 P Q + 4 H + ( s t r o m a ) ⟶ O 2 +\n2 P Q H 2 + 4 H + ( l u m e n ) {\\displaystyle 4\\ photons(680nm)\\ +\\ 2H_{2}O\\\n+\\ 2PQ\\ +\\ 4H^{+}(stroma)\\longrightarrow O_{2}\\ +\\ 2PQH_{2}\\ +\\ 4H^{+}(lumen)}\n![{\\\\displaystyle 4\\\\ photons\\(680nm\\)\\\\ +\\\\ 2H_{2}O\\\\ +\\\\ 2PQ\\\\ +\\\\\n4H^{+}\\(stroma\\)\\\\longrightarrow O_{2}\\\\ +\\\\ 2PQH_{2}\\\\ +\\\\\n4H^{+}\\(lumen\\)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8b976f66ecea3240827bc23ea2cdc3fda613aebc)[16]\n\nAfter being released from PSII, PQH2 travels to the cytochrome b6f complex\nwhich then transfers two electrons from PQH2 to\n[plastocyanin](/wiki/Plastocyanin \"Plastocyanin\") in two separate reactions.\nThe process that occurs is similar to the Q-cycle in Complex III of the\nelectron transport chain. In the first reaction, PQH2 binds to the complex on\nthe lumen side and one electron is transferred to the [iron-sulfur\ncenter](/wiki/Iron%E2%80%93sulfur_protein \"Iron–sulfur protein\") which then\ntransfers it to [cytochrome f](/wiki/Cytochrome_f \"Cytochrome f\") which then\ntransfers it to plastocyanin. The second electron is transferred to [heme\nbL](/wiki/Heme_B \"Heme B\") which then transfers it to heme bH which then\ntransfers it to PQ. In the second reaction, a second PQH2 gets oxidized,\nadding an electron to another plastocyanin and PQ. Both reactions together\ntransfer four protons into the lumen.[18][19]\n\n### Oxidative\nPhosphorylation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Electrochemical_gradient&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Oxidative Phosphorylation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/ETC_electron_transport_chain.svg/220px-\nETC_electron_transport_chain.svg.png)](/wiki/File:ETC_electron_transport_chain.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ETC_electron_transport_chain.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDetailed diagram of the electron transport chain in mitochondria.\n\nIn the electron transport chain, Complex I (CI) [catalyzes](/wiki/Catalysis\n\"Catalysis\") the [reduction](/wiki/Redox \"Redox\") of\n[ubiquinone](/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10 \"Coenzyme Q10\") (UQ) to\n[ubiquinol](/wiki/Ubiquinol \"Ubiquinol\") (UQH2) by the transfer of two\n[electrons](/wiki/Electron \"Electron\") from reduced [nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide](/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide \"Nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide\") (NADH) which translocates four protons from the mitochondrial\nmatrix to the IMS:[20]\n\nN A D H + H + + U Q + 4 H + ( m a t r i x ) ⟶ N A D + + U Q H 2 + 4 H + ( I M\nS ) {\\displaystyle NADH+H^{+}+UQ+4H^{+}(matrix)\\longrightarrow\nNAD^{+}+UQH_{2}+4H^{+}(IMS)} ![{\\\\displaystyle\nNADH+H^{+}+UQ+4H^{+}\\(matrix\\)\\\\longrightarrow\nNAD^{+}+UQH_{2}+4H^{+}\\(IMS\\)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/073154f525e2bd9e3ac6bf288e4641e8a7f79277)[20]\n\nComplex III (CIII) catalyzes the [Q-cycle](/wiki/Q_cycle \"Q cycle\").

In the second step, two more electrons reduce UQ to UQH2 at the\nQi site.[20] The total reaction is shown:\n\n2 c y t o c h r o m e c ( o x i d i z e d ) + U Q H 2 + 2 H + ( m a t r i x )\n⟶ 2 c y t o c h r o m e c ( r e d u c e d ) + U Q + 4 H + ( I M S )\n{\\displaystyle 2\\ cytochrome\\ c\\ (oxidized)\\ +\\ UQH_{2}\\ +\\ 2H^{+}\\\n(matrix)\\longrightarrow 2\\ cytochrome\\ c\\ (reduced)\\ +\\ UQ\\ +\\ 4H^{+}\\ (IMS)}\n![{\\\\displaystyle 2\\\\ cytochrome\\\\ c\\\\ \\(oxidized\\)\\\\ +\\\\ UQH_{2}\\\\ +\\\\\n2H^{+}\\\\ \\(matrix\\)\\\\longrightarrow 2\\\\ cytochrome\\\\ c\\\\ \\(reduced\\)\\\\ +\\\\\nUQ\\\\ +\\\\ 4H^{+}\\\\\n\\(IMS\\)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ff3f59cb06631968b20c982903a04688985fcf6)[20]\n\nComplex IV (CIV) catalyzes the transfer of two electrons from the cytochrome c\nreduced by CIII to one half of a full oxygen.
