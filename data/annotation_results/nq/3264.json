Ballet spread from [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\") to\n[France](/wiki/France \"France\") with the help of [Catherine de'\nMedici](/wiki/Catherine_de%27_Medici \"Catherine de' Medici\"), where ballet\ndeveloped even further under her aristocratic influence. An early example of\nCatherine's development of ballet is through 'Le Paradis d' Amour', a piece of\nwork presented at her daughter's wedding, [Marguerite de\nValois](/wiki/Margaret_of_Valois \"Margaret of Valois\") to [Henry of\nNavarre](/wiki/Henry_of_Navarre \"Henry of Navarre\"). Aristocratic money was\nresponsible for the initial stages of development in 'court ballet', as it was\nroyal money that dictated the ideas, literature and music used in ballets that\nwere created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time. The first\nformal 'court ballet' ever recognized was staged in 1573, 'Ballet des\nPolonais'. In true form of royal entertainment, 'Ballet des Polonais' was\ncommissioned by Catherine de' Medici to honor the [Polish](/wiki/Poland\n\"Poland\") ambassadors who were visiting [Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\") upon the\naccession of [Henry of Anjou](/wiki/Henry_III_of_France \"Henry III of France\")\nto the throne of Poland. In 1581, Catherine de' Medici commissioned another\ncourt ballet, _[Ballet Comique de la Reine](/wiki/Ballet_Comique_de_la_Reine\n\"Ballet Comique de la Reine\")_ , however it was her compatriot, [Balthasar de\nBeaujoyeulx](/wiki/Balthasar_de_Beaujoyeulx \"Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx\"), who\norganized the ballet. Catherine de' Medici and Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx were\nresponsible for presenting the first court ballet ever to apply the principles\nof Baif's Academie, by integrating poetry, dance, music and set design to\nconvey a unified dramatic storyline. Moreover, the early organization and\ndevelopment of 'court ballet' was funded by, influenced by and produced by the\naristocrats of the time, fulfilling both their personal entertainment and\npolitical propaganda needs.\n\nIn the late 17th century [Louis XIV](/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France \"Louis XIV of\nFrance\") founded the Académie Royale de Musique (the [Paris\nOpera](/wiki/Paris_Opera \"Paris Opera\")) within which emerged the first\nprofessional theatrical [ballet company](/wiki/Ballet_company \"Ballet\ncompany\"), the [Paris Opera Ballet](/wiki/Paris_Opera_Ballet \"Paris Opera\nBallet\"). The predominance of French in the [vocabulary of\nballet](/wiki/Glossary_of_ballet \"Glossary of ballet\") reflects this history.\nTheatrical ballet soon became an independent form of art, although still\nfrequently maintaining a close association with opera, and spread from the\nheart of Europe to other nations. The [Royal Danish\nBallet](/wiki/Royal_Danish_Ballet \"Royal Danish Ballet\") and the [Imperial\nBallet](/wiki/Mariinsky_Ballet \"Mariinsky Ballet\") of the [Russian\nEmpire](/wiki/Russian_Empire \"Russian Empire\") were founded in the 1740s and\nbegan to flourish, especially after about 1850. In 1907 the Russian ballet in\nturn moved back to France, where the [Ballets Russes](/wiki/Ballets_Russes\n\"Ballets Russes\") of [Sergei Diaghilev](/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev \"Sergei\nDiaghilev\") and its successors were particularly influential. Soon ballet\nspread around the world with the formation of new companies, including\nLondon's [The Royal Ballet](/wiki/The_Royal_Ballet \"The Royal Ballet\") (1931),\nthe [San Francisco Ballet](/wiki/San_Francisco_Ballet \"San Francisco Ballet\")\n(1933), [American Ballet Theatre](/wiki/American_Ballet_Theatre \"American\nBallet Theatre\") (1937), The Royal Winnipeg Ballet (1939), [The Australian\nBallet](/wiki/The_Australian_Ballet \"The Australian Ballet\") (1940), the [New\nYork City Ballet](/wiki/New_York_City_Ballet \"New York City Ballet\") (1948),\nthe [National Ballet of Canada](/wiki/National_Ballet_of_Canada \"National\nBallet of Canada\") (1951), and the [National Ballet Academy and Trust of\nIndia](/wiki/National_Ballet_Academy_and_Trust_of_India \"National Ballet\nAcademy and Trust of India\") (2002).[1]\n\nIn the 20th century styles of ballet continued to develop and strongly\ninfluence broader [concert dance](/wiki/Concert_dance \"Concert dance\"), for\nexample, in the United States choreographer [George\nBalanchine](/wiki/George_Balanchine \"George Balanchine\") developed what is now\nknown as [neoclassical ballet](/wiki/Neoclassical_ballet \"Neoclassical\nballet\"), subsequent developments have included [contemporary\nballet](/wiki/Contemporary_ballet \"Contemporary ballet\") and [post-\nstructural](/wiki/Post-structuralism \"Post-structuralism\") ballet, for example\nseen in the work of [William Forsythe](/wiki/William_Forsythe_\\(dancer\\)\n\"William Forsythe \\(dancer\\)\") in Germany.\n\nThe [etymology](/wiki/Etymology \"Etymology\") of the word \"ballet\" reflects its\nhistory. The word _ballet_ comes from French and was borrowed into English\naround the 17th century. The French word in turn has its origins in Italian\n_balletto_ , a [diminutive](/wiki/Diminutive \"Diminutive\") of _ballo_ (dance).\n_Ballet_ ultimately traces back to [Italian](/wiki/Italian_language \"Italian\nlanguage\") _ballare_ , meaning _\" to dance\"_.[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Origins\n    * 1.1 Renaissance – Italy and France\n    * 1.2 17th century – France and Court Dance\n    * 1.3 Popularity throughout Europe\n  * 2 18th century\n    * 2.1 France and development as an art form\n    * 2.2 Outside France\n  * 3 19th century\n    * 3.1 Romantic movement\n    * 3.2 Russia\n    * 3.3 Argentina\n  * 4 20th century and modernism\n    * 4.1 Russia and the Ballets Russes\n    * 4.2 United States of America\n  * 5 Neoclassical ballet\n  * 6 Contemporary\n  * 7 Development of ballet method\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Further reading\n\n## Origins[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_ballet&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Origins\")]\n\n### Renaissance – Italy and\nFrance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_ballet&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Renaissance – Italy and France\")]\n\nMain article: [Renaissance dance](/wiki/Renaissance_dance \"Renaissance dance\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Ballet_1582.png/180px-\nBallet_1582.png)](/wiki/File:Ballet_1582.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ballet_1582.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nEngraving of the second scene of the _[Ballet Comique de la\nReine](/wiki/Ballet_Comique_de_la_Reine \"Ballet Comique de la Reine\")_ ,\nstaged in Paris in 1581 for the French court.\n\nBallet originated in the [Renaissance](/wiki/Renaissance \"Renaissance\")\n[court](/wiki/Royal_court \"Royal court\") as an outgrowth of court pageantry in\n[Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\"),[3] where aristocratic weddings were lavish\ncelebrations. [Tutus](/wiki/Tutu_\\(ballet\\) \"Tutu \\(ballet\\)\"), ballet\nslippers and pointe work were not yet used. The choreography was adapted from\ncourt dance steps.[4] Performers dressed in fashions of the times. For women\nthat meant formal gowns that covered their legs to the ankle.[5] Early ballet\nwas participatory, with the audience joining the dance towards the end.\n\n[Domenico da Piacenza](/wiki/Domenico_da_Piacenza \"Domenico da Piacenza\") (c.\n1400–c. 1470) was one of the first dancing masters. Along with his students,\n[Antonio Cornazzano](/wiki/Antonio_Cornazzano \"Antonio Cornazzano\") and\n[Guglielmo Ebreo](/wiki/Guglielmo_Ebreo \"Guglielmo Ebreo\"), he was trained in\ndance and responsible for teaching nobles the art. Da Piacenza left one work:\n_De arte saltandi et choreus ducendi_ (On the art of dancing and conducting\ndances), which was put together by his students.[6]\n\nIn 1489 [Galeazzo, Duke of Milan](/wiki/Gian_Galeazzo_Sforza \"Gian Galeazzo\nSforza\"), married [Isabella of\nAragon](/wiki/Isabella_of_Aragon,_Duchess_of_Milan \"Isabella of Aragon,\nDuchess of Milan\") in [Tortona](/wiki/Tortona \"Tortona\"). An elaborate dance\nentertainment was arranged for the celebrations by the Italian dance master\nBergonzio di Botta. The dances were linked by a slim narrative concerning\n[Jason](/wiki/Jason \"Jason\") and the [Argonauts](/wiki/Argonauts \"Argonauts\"),\nand each corresponded to a different course for the dinner. Tristano Calco of\nMilan wrote about the event, and it was considered so impressive, that many\nsimilar spectacles were organized elsewhere.[7][8]\n\nBallet was further shaped by the French _[ballet de cour](/wiki/Ballet_de_cour\n\"Ballet de cour\")_ , which consisted of social dances performed by the\nnobility in tandem with music, speech, verse, song, pageant, decor and\ncostume.[9] When [Catherine de' Medici](/wiki/Catherine_de%27_Medici\n\"Catherine de' Medici\"), an Italian aristocrat with an interest in the arts,\nmarried the French crown heir [Henry II](/wiki/Henry_II_of_France \"Henry II of\nFrance\"), she brought her enthusiasm for dance to France and provided\nfinancial support. [Catherine's glittering\nentertainments](/wiki/Catherine_de%27_Medici%27s_court_festivals \"Catherine\nde' Medici's court festivals\") supported the aims of court politics and\nusually were organized around mythological themes.[10] The first _ballet de\ncour_ was the _Ballet de Polonais._ This Ballet was performed in 1573 on the\noccasion of the visit of the Polish Ambassador. It was choreographed by\nBalthasar de Beaaujoyeulx and featured an hour-long dance for sixteen women,\neach representing a French province. _Ballet Comique de la Reine_ (1581),\nwhich was also choreographed and directed by [Balthasar de\nBeaujoyeulx](/wiki/Balthasar_de_Beaujoyeulx \"Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx\"), was\ncommissioned by [Louise of Lorraine](/wiki/Louise_of_Lorraine \"Louise of\nLorraine\"), queen consort of [King Henry III](/wiki/Henry_III_of_France \"Henry\nIII of France\"), son of Catherine, to celebrate the marriage of Henry's\nfavorite the [Duke de Joyeuse](/wiki/Anne_de_Joyeuse \"Anne de Joyeuse\") to\nMarguerite de Lorraine, the sister of Queen Louise. The ballet lasted for more\nthan five hours and was danced by twenty four dancers: twelve\n[naiades](/wiki/Naiad \"Naiad\") and twelve pages.[11][12]\n\nIn the same year, the publication of [Fabritio Caroso](/wiki/Fabritio_Caroso\n\"Fabritio Caroso\")'s _Il Ballarino_ , a technical manual on court dancing,\nboth performance and social, helped to establish [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\")\nas a centre of technical ballet development.[13]\n\n### 17th century – France and Court\nDance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_ballet&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: 17th century – France and Court Dance\")]\n\nMain article: [French ballet](/wiki/French_ballet \"French ballet\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Ballet_de_la_nuit_1653.jpg/180px-\nBallet_de_la_nuit_1653.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ballet_de_la_nuit_1653.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ballet_de_la_nuit_1653.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Louis XIV](/wiki/Louis_XIV \"Louis XIV\") in [Lully](/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lully\n\"Jean-Baptiste Lully\")'s _[Ballet Royal de la\nNuit](/wiki/Ballet_Royal_de_la_Nuit \"Ballet Royal de la Nuit\")_ (1653).\n\nBallet developed as a performance-focused art form in France during the reign\nof [Louis XIV](/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France \"Louis XIV of France\"), who was\npassionate about dance.[14] [Pierre Beauchamp](/wiki/Pierre_Beauchamp \"Pierre\nBeauchamp\"), the man who codified the five basic positions of the\n[feet](/wiki/Positions_of_the_feet_in_ballet \"Positions of the feet in\nballet\") in ballet, was the king's personal dance teacher and favorite partner\nin _[ballet de cour](/wiki/Ballet_de_cour \"Ballet de cour\")_ in the 1650s.[15]\nIn 1661 Louis XIV, who was determined to reverse a decline in dance standards\nthat began in the 17th century, established the [Académie Royale de\nDanse](/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Royale_de_Danse \"Académie Royale de Danse\").[14]\nBeauchamp was appointed _Intendant des ballets du roi_ and in 1680 became the\ndirector of the dance academy, a position he held until 1687.[15]\n\n[Jean-Baptiste Lully](/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lully \"Jean-Baptiste Lully\"), an\nItalian violinist, dancer, choreographer, and composer, who joined the court\nof Louis XIV in 1652,[16] played a significant role in establishing the\ngeneral direction ballet would follow for the next century. Supported and\nadmired by King Louis XIV, Lully often cast the king in his ballets. The title\nof _Sun King_ for the French monarch, originated in Louis XIV's role in\nLully's _[Ballet de la Nuit](/wiki/Ballet_de_la_Nuit \"Ballet de la Nuit\")_\n(1653). The fourteen-year-old Louis XIV danced five roles in this 12-hour\nballet.[17] This Ballet was lavish and featured a scene where a set piece of a\nhouse was burned down, included witches, werewolves, gypsies, shepherds,\nthieves, and the goddesses Venus and Diana. Lully's main contribution to\nballet were his nuanced compositions. His understanding of movement and dance\nallowed him to compose specifically for ballet, with musical phrasings that\ncomplemented physical movements.[18] Lully also collaborated with the French\nplaywright [Molière](/wiki/Moli%C3%A8re \"Molière\"). Together, they took an\nItalian theatre style, the _commedia dell 'arte_, and adapted it into their\nwork for a French audience, creating the _[comédie-ballet](/wiki/Com%C3%A9die-\nballet \"Comédie-ballet\")_. Among their greatest productions, with Beauchamp as\nthe choreographer,[15] was _[Le Bourgeois\nGentilhomme](/wiki/Le_Bourgeois_Gentilhomme \"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\")_\n(1670).[19]\n\nIn 1669 Louis XIV founded the [Académie\nd'Opéra](/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_d%27Op%C3%A9ra \"Académie d'Opéra\") with [Pierre\nPerrin](/wiki/Pierre_Perrin \"Pierre Perrin\") as director.[20] Louix XIV\nretired in 1670, largely because of excessive weight gain. Earlier, in 1661 he\nhad founded a school, the _Adacemie Royale de danse_. Beauchamp was the first\nballet-master of the Opéra and created the dances for the new company's first\nproduction _Pomone_ with music by [Robert Cambert](/wiki/Robert_Cambert\n\"Robert Cambert\").[15] Later, after Perrin went bankrupt, the king\nreestablished the Opéra as the Académie royale de Musique and made Lully the\ndirector.[20] Beauchamp was one of the principal choreographers.[15] In this\nposition Lully, with his librettist [Philippe\nQuinault](/wiki/Philippe_Quinault \"Philippe Quinault\"), created a new genre,\nthe _tragédie en musique_ , each act of which featured a _divertissement_ that\nwas a miniature ballet scene.[16] With almost all his important creations\nJean-Baptiste Lully brought together music and drama with Italian and French\ndance elements. His work created a legacy which would define the future of\nballet.\n\n### Popularity throughout\nEurope[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_ballet&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Popularity throughout Europe\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Daniel_Rabel_-\n_The_Royal_Ballet_of_the_Dowager_of_Bilbao%27s_Grand_Ball_-\n_WGA18593.jpg/220px-Daniel_Rabel_-\n_The_Royal_Ballet_of_the_Dowager_of_Bilbao%27s_Grand_Ball_-\n_WGA18593.jpg)](/wiki/File:Daniel_Rabel_-\n_The_Royal_Ballet_of_the_Dowager_of_Bilbao%27s_Grand_Ball_-_WGA18593.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Daniel_Rabel_-\n_The_Royal_Ballet_of_the_Dowager_of_Bilbao%27s_Grand_Ball_-_WGA18593.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Royal Ballet of the Dowager of [Bilbao](/wiki/Bilbao \"Bilbao\")'s Grand\nBall, 1626.\n\nFrance's court was in some ways the leading source of fashionable culture for\nmany other royal courts in Europe.

Central to this advance was the seminal work of [Jean-Georges\nNoverre](/wiki/Jean-Georges_Noverre \"Jean-Georges Noverre\"), _Lettres sur la\ndanse et les ballets_ (1760), which focused on developing the [ballet\nd'action](/wiki/Ballet_d%27action \"Ballet d'action\"), in which the movements\nof the dancers are designed to express character and assist in the narrative.\nNoverre believed that: ballet should be technical but also move the audience\nemotionally, plots need to be unified, the scenery and music need to support\nthe plot and be unified within the story, and that pantomime needs to be\nsimple and understandable.[22]\n\nReforms were made in ballet composition by composers such as [Christoph\nWillibald Gluck](/wiki/Christoph_Willibald_Gluck \"Christoph Willibald Gluck\").\nFinally, ballet was divided into three formal techniques _sérieux_ , _demi-\ncaractère_ and _comique_.

In 1834, Fanny Elssler arrived at the Paris Opera and became known\nas the \"Pagan Dancer,\" because of the fiery qualities of the _Cachucha_ dance\nthat made her famous.

These \"unreal\" ballets\nportrayed women as fragile unearthly beings, ethereal creatures who could be\nlifted effortlessly and almost seemed to float in the air. Ballerinas began to\nwear costumes with pastel, flowing skirts that bared the shins. The stories\nrevolved around uncanny, folkloric spirits. An example of one such romantic\nballet is _[La Sylphide](/wiki/La_Sylphide \"La Sylphide\")_ , one of the oldest\nromantic ballets still performed today.\n\nOne strain of the Romantic movement was a new exploration of folklore and\ntraditional ethnic culture. This influence was seen in the emergence of\nEuropean folk dance and western portrayals of African, Asian, and Middle East\npeoples on European stages. In ballets from this period, non-European\ncharacters were often created as villains or as silly divertisements to fit\nthe [orientalist](/wiki/Orientalism \"Orientalism\") western understanding of\nthe world.[26] The [National Opera of Ukraine](/wiki/National_Opera_of_Ukraine\n\"National Opera of Ukraine\"), a performing arts theatre with a resident opera\ncompany, was established in [Kiev](/wiki/Kiev \"Kiev\") in 1867. It also\nincluded a small resident troupe of ballet dancers, who would perform mainly\nfolk-style dancing during opera productions. By 1893, this grew to a troupe\nlarge enough to stage large ballets. Folk dancing and ballets with Ukrainian\nstories were among the early productions.[27]\n\nMany leading European professional ballet companies that survive today were\nestablished at new theatres in Europe's capital cities during the mid- to\nlate- 19th century, including the [Kiev Ballet](/wiki/Kiev_Ballet \"Kiev\nBallet\"), the [Hungarian National Ballet](/wiki/Hungarian_National_Ballet\n\"Hungarian National Ballet\"), the [National Theatre Ballet\n(Prague)](/wiki/National_Theatre_Ballet_\\(Prague\\) \"National Theatre Ballet\n\\(Prague\\)\") and the [Vienna State Ballet](/wiki/Vienna_State_Ballet \"Vienna\nState Ballet\") (formerly the [Vienna State Opera](/wiki/Vienna_State_Opera\n\"Vienna State Opera\") Ballet). These theatres usually combined large opera,\ndrama and ballet companies under the same roof. Composers, dramatists, and\nchoreographers were then able to create works that took advantage of the\nability to collaborate among these performance troupes.\n\n### Russia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_ballet&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Russia\")]\n\nMain article: [Russian ballet](/wiki/Russian_ballet \"Russian ballet\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Swanlakemordkin.jpg/180px-\nSwanlakemordkin.jpg)](/wiki/File:Swanlakemordkin.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Swanlakemordkin.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Mikhail Mordkin](/wiki/Mikhail_Mordkin \"Mikhail Mordkin\") as Prince Siegfried\nand [Adelaide Giuri](/w/index.php?title=Adelaide_Giuri&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Adelaide Giuri \\(page does not exist\\)\") as Odette with students as the\nlittle swans in the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre's production of the\nPetipa/Ivanov/Tchaikovsky _[Swan Lake](/wiki/Swan_Lake \"Swan Lake\")_. 1901\n\nWhile France was instrumental in early ballet, other countries and cultures\nsoon adopted the art form, most notably Russia. Russia has a recognized\ntradition of ballet, and Russian ballet has had great importance in its\ncountry throughout history. After 1850, ballet began to wane in Paris, but it\nflourished in [Denmark](/wiki/Denmark \"Denmark\") and [Russia](/wiki/Russia\n\"Russia\") thanks to masters such as [August\nBournonville](/wiki/August_Bournonville \"August Bournonville\"), [Jules\nPerrot](/wiki/Jules_Perrot \"Jules Perrot\"), [Arthur Saint-\nLéon](/wiki/Arthur_Saint-L%C3%A9on \"Arthur Saint-Léon\"), [Enrico\nCecchetti](/wiki/Enrico_Cecchetti \"Enrico Cecchetti\") and [Marius\nPetipa](/wiki/Marius_Petipa \"Marius Petipa\"). In the late nineteenth century,\n[orientalism](/wiki/Orientalism \"Orientalism\") was in vogue. Colonialism\nbrought awareness of Asian and African cultures, but distorted with\ndisinformation and fantasy. The East was often perceived as a faraway place\nwhere anything was possible, provided it was lavish, exotic and decadent.\nPetipa appealed to popular taste with _[The Pharaoh's\nDaughter](/wiki/The_Pharaoh%27s_Daughter \"The Pharaoh's Daughter\")_ (1862),\nand later _[The Talisman](/wiki/The_Talisman_\\(ballet\\) \"The Talisman\n\\(ballet\\)\")_ (1889), and _[La Bayadère](/wiki/La_Bayad%C3%A8re \"La\nBayadère\")_ (1877). Petipa is best remembered for his collaborations with\n[Tchaikovsky](/wiki/Tchaikovsky \"Tchaikovsky\"). He used his music for his\nchoreography of _[The Nutcracker](/wiki/The_Nutcracker \"The Nutcracker\")_\n(1892, though this is open to some debate among historians), _[The Sleeping\nBeauty](/wiki/The_Sleeping_Beauty_Ballet \"The Sleeping Beauty Ballet\")_\n(1890), and the definitive revival of _[Swan Lake](/wiki/Swan_Lake \"Swan\nLake\")_ (1895, with [Lev Ivanov](/wiki/Lev_Ivanov \"Lev Ivanov\")). These works\nwere all drawn from European folklore.\n\nThe female dancers' classical [tutu](/wiki/Ballet_tutu \"Ballet tutu\") as it is\nrecognized today began to appear at this time. It consisted of a short, stiff\nskirt supported by layers of crinoline or tulle that revealed the acrobatic\nlegwork, combined with a wide gusset that served to preserve modesty.\n\n###\nArgentina[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_ballet&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Argentina\")]\n\nBallet companies from Europe began lucrative tours of theatres in North,\nCentral and South America during the mid-19th century. The prestigious [Colon\nTheater](/wiki/Colon_Theater \"Colon Theater\") in Buenos Aires, Argentina had\nhosted foreign ballet artists on its stage, with touring companies from Europe\npresenting full ballets as early as 1867.[28] By the 1880s, the Colon Theater\nhad its own professional ballet company.

It was made up of dancers from\nthe Russian exile community in Paris after the Revolution.\n\nDiaghilev and composer [Igor Stravinsky](/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky \"Igor\nStravinsky\") merged their talents to bring Russian folklore to life in _[The\nFirebird](/wiki/The_Firebird \"The Firebird\")_ and _[Petrushka](/wiki/Petrushka\n\"Petrushka\")_ choreographed by Fokine. Diaghilev's next choreographic\ncommissions went to Nijinsky. His First ballet was _L 'apres-midi d'un Faune_\n(Afternoon of a Faun) to music by Debussy. It was notable for its two\ndimensional shapes and lack of ballet technique. It caused controversy by\ndepicting the faun rubbing the scarf of one of the maidens on himself, in\nsimulated masturbation. The most controversial work of the Ballets Russes\nhowever, was _[The Rite of Spring](/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring \"The Rite of\nSpring\")_ , choreographed by Nijinsky with music by Stravinsky. The ballet's\nmodern music, pigeon toed stomping and theme of human sacrifice shocked\naudiences so much they rioted.\n\nAfter the “golden age” of Petipa, [Michel Fokine](/wiki/Michel_Fokine \"Michel\nFokine\") began his career in St. Petersburg but moved to Paris and worked with\nDiaghilev and the Ballets Russes.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Vaslav_Nijinsky_in_Le_spectre_de_la_rose_1911_Royal_Opera_House.jpg/200px-\nVaslav_Nijinsky_in_Le_spectre_de_la_rose_1911_Royal_Opera_House.jpg)](/wiki/File:Vaslav_Nijinsky_in_Le_spectre_de_la_rose_1911_Royal_Opera_House.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Vaslav_Nijinsky_in_Le_spectre_de_la_rose_1911_Royal_Opera_House.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Vaslav Nijinsky](/wiki/Vaslav_Nijinsky \"Vaslav Nijinsky\") in _[The Spectre of\nthe Rose](/wiki/The_Spectre_of_the_Rose \"The Spectre of the Rose\")_ , 1911.\n\nRussian ballet continued development under Soviet rule. There was little\ntalent left in the country after the Revolution, but it was enough to seed a\nnew generation. After stagnation in the 1920s, by the mid-1930s that new\ngeneration of dancers and choreographers appeared on the scene. The technical\nperfection and precision of dance was promoted (and demanded) by [Agrippina\nVaganova](/wiki/Agrippina_Vaganova \"Agrippina Vaganova\"), who had been taught\nby Petipa and Cecchetti and headed the [Vaganova Ballet\nAcademy](/wiki/Vaganova_Ballet_Academy \"Vaganova Ballet Academy\"), the school\nto prepare dancers for the Kirov Ballet in St. Petersburg/Leningrad.\n\nBallet was popular with the public. Both the Moscow-based Bolshoi and the St.\nPetersburg (then Leningrad)-based Kirov ballet companies were active.\nIdeological pressure forced the creation of many [socialist\nrealist](/wiki/Socialist_realist \"Socialist realist\") pieces, most of which\nmade little impression on the public and were removed from the repertoire of\nboth companies later.\n\nSome pieces of that era, however, were remarkable. The _[Romeo and\nJuliet](/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet \"Romeo and Juliet\")_ by\n[Prokofiev](/wiki/Prokofiev \"Prokofiev\") and [Lavrovsky](/wiki/Lavrovsky\n\"Lavrovsky\") is a masterpiece. The _[Flames of Paris](/wiki/Flames_of_Paris\n\"Flames of Paris\")_ , while it shows all the faults of socialist realist art,\npioneered the active use of the corps de ballet in the performance and\nrequired stunning virtuosity. The [ballet\nversion](/wiki/The_Fountain_of_Bakhchisarai_\\(ballet\\) \"The Fountain of\nBakhchisarai \\(ballet\\)\") of the [Pushkin](/wiki/Pushkin \"Pushkin\") poem,\n_[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai](/wiki/The_Fountain_of_Bakhchisarai \"The\nFountain of Bakhchisarai\")_ with music from [Boris\nAsafiev](/wiki/Boris_Asafiev \"Boris Asafiev\") and choreography by [Rostislav\nZakharov](/wiki/Rostislav_Zakharov \"Rostislav Zakharov\") was also a hit.\n\nThe well-known ballet _[Cinderella](/wiki/Cinderella_\\(Prokofiev\\) \"Cinderella\n\\(Prokofiev\\)\")_ , for which Prokofiev provided the music, is also the product\nof the Soviet ballet. During the Soviet era, these pieces were mostly unknown\noutside the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") and later\noutside of the [Eastern Bloc](/wiki/Eastern_Bloc \"Eastern Bloc\"). However,\nafter the collapse of the Soviet Union they received more recognition.\n\nThe 1999 North American premiere of _[The Fountain of\nBakhchisarai](/wiki/The_Fountain_of_Bakhchisarai_\\(ballet\\) \"The Fountain of\nBakhchisarai \\(ballet\\)\")_ by the Kirov Ballet in New York was an outstanding\nsuccess, for example. The Soviet era of the Russian Ballet put a lot of\nemphasis on technique, virtuosity and strength. It demanded strength usually\nabove the norm of contemporary Western dancers. When watching restored old\nfootage, one can only marvel at the talent of their prima ballerinas such as\n[Galina Ulanova](/wiki/Galina_Ulanova \"Galina Ulanova\"), [Natalya\nDudinskaya](/wiki/Natalya_Dudinskaya \"Natalya Dudinskaya\") and [Maya\nPlisetskaya](/wiki/Maya_Plisetskaya \"Maya Plisetskaya\") and choreographers\nsuch as [Pyotr Gusev](/wiki/Pyotr_Gusev \"Pyotr Gusev\").\n\nRussian companies, particularly after World War II engaged in multiple tours\nall over the world that revitalized ballet in the West.\n\n_[Maiden Tower](/wiki/Maiden_Tower_\\(ballet\\) \"Maiden Tower \\(ballet\\)\")_[29]\nwritten by [Afrasiyab Badalbeyli](/wiki/Afrasiyab_Badalbeyli \"Afrasiyab\nBadalbeyli\") is the first ballet in the [Muslim](/wiki/Muslim \"Muslim\")\nEast.[30][31][29]\n\n### United States of\nAmerica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_ballet&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: United States of America\")]\n\nFollowing the move of the Ballets Russes to France, ballet began to have a\nbroader influence, particularly in the United States of America.\n\nFrom Paris, after disagreements with Diaghilev, Fokine went to Sweden and then\nthe USA and settled in New York. Diaghilev believed that traditional ballet\noffered little more than prettiness and athletic display. For Fokine that was\nnot enough. In addition to technical virtuosity he demanded drama, expression\nand historical authenticity. The choreographer must research the period and\ncultural context of the setting and reject the traditional tutu in favour of\naccurate period costuming.\n\nFokine choreographed _[Sheherazade](/wiki/Scheherazade_\\(Rimsky-Korsakov\\)\n\"Scheherazade \\(Rimsky-Korsakov\\)\")_ and _[Cleopatra](/wiki/Cleopatra_ballet\n\"Cleopatra ballet\")_. He also reworked _Petrouchka_ and _The Firebird_. One of\nhis most famous works was _[The Dying Swan](/wiki/The_Dying_Swan \"The Dying\nSwan\")_ , performed by [Anna Pavlova](/wiki/Anna_Pavlova \"Anna Pavlova\").\nBeyond her talents as a ballerina, Pavlova had the theatrical gifts to fulfill\nFokine's vision of ballet as drama. Legend has it that Pavlova identified so\nmuch with the swan role that she requested her swan costume from her deathbed.\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/La_Mort_du_Cygne_1_Anna_Pavlova_2_Yvette_Chauvire_3_Natalia_Makarova.mpg.ogv/192px\n--\nLa_Mort_du_Cygne_1_Anna_Pavlova_2_Yvette_Chauvire_3_Natalia_Makarova.mpg.ogv.jpg)\n\n[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/3/3c/La_Mort_du_Cygne_1_Anna_Pavlova_2_Yvette_Chauvire_3_Natalia_Makarova.mpg.ogv/La_Mort_du_Cygne_1_Anna_Pavlova_2_Yvette_Chauvire_3_Natalia_Makarova.mpg.ogv.160p.webm)\n\n[](/wiki/File:La_Mort_du_Cygne_1_Anna_Pavlova_2_Yvette_Chauvire_3_Natalia_Makarova.mpg.ogv\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n_[The Dying Swan](/wiki/The_Dying_Swan \"The Dying Swan\")_ choreographed by\n[Fokine](/wiki/Fokine \"Fokine\"), performed by three soloists (shown in order):\n1.

He adapted ballet to the new media, movies and\ntelevision.[32] A prolific worker, Balanchine rechoreographed classics such as\n_Swan Lake_ and _Sleeping Beauty_ as well as creating new ballets. He produced\noriginal interpretations of the dramas of [William\nShakespeare](/wiki/William_Shakespeare \"William Shakespeare\") such as _[Romeo\nand Juliet](/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet \"Romeo and Juliet\")_ and _[A Midsummer\nNight's Dream](/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream \"A Midsummer Night's\nDream\")_, and also of Franz Léhar's _[The Merry Widow](/wiki/The_Merry_Widow\n\"The Merry Widow\")_.\n\nIn 1967, Balanchine's _[Jewels](/wiki/Jewels_\\(ballet\\) \"Jewels \\(ballet\\)\")_\nbroke with the narrative tradition and dramatized a theme rather than a plot.\nThis focus fits with the state-sponsored funding sources in the United States\nwhich sought to encourage \"liberty and freethinking\" in contrast to narrative-\ndriven dance, which was seen as to be connected too closely with socialism,\nespecially [Soviet communism](/wiki/State_ideology_of_the_Soviet_Union \"State\nideology of the Soviet Union\").[33] Today, partly thanks to Balanchine, ballet\nis one of the most well-preserved dances in the world.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nBarbara Karinska was a Russian emigree and a skilled seamstress who\ncollaborated with Balanchine to elevate the art of costume design from a\nsecondary role to an integral part of a ballet performance. She introduced the\n[bias cut](/wiki/Bias_cut \"Bias cut\") and a simplified classic tutu that\nallowed the dancer more freedom of movement. With meticulous attention to\ndetail, she decorated her tutus with beadwork, embroidery, crochet and\nappliqué.\n\n## Neoclassical\nballet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_ballet&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Neoclassical ballet\")]\n\nMain article: [Neoclassical ballet](/wiki/Neoclassical_ballet \"Neoclassical\nballet\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Ballets_Russes_-\n_Apollo_musag%C3%A8te.jpg/200px-Ballets_Russes_-\n_Apollo_musag%C3%A8te.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ballets_Russes_-\n_Apollo_musag%C3%A8te.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ballets_Russes_-_Apollo_musag%C3%A8te.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Ballets Russes](/wiki/Ballets_Russes \"Ballets Russes\") with\n_[Apollo](/wiki/Apollo_\\(ballet\\) \"Apollo \\(ballet\\)\")_ (1928) choreographed\nby [George Balanchine](/wiki/George_Balanchine \"George Balanchine\").

Tim\nScholl, author of _From Petipa to Balanchine_ , considers Balanchine's\n_[Apollo](/wiki/Apollo_\\(ballet\\) \"Apollo \\(ballet\\)\")_ (1928) to be the first\nneoclassical ballet.

Tharp choreographed _Push\nComes To Shove_ for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976; in 1986 she created _In The\nUpper Room_ for her own company. Both these pieces were considered innovative\nfor their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of pointe\nshoes and classically trained dancers—for their use of contemporary ballet.\n\nTharp also worked with the [Joffrey Ballet](/wiki/Joffrey_Ballet \"Joffrey\nBallet\") company, founded in 1957 by [Robert Joffrey](/wiki/Robert_Joffrey\n\"Robert Joffrey\"). She choreographed _[Deuce Coupe](/wiki/Deuce_Coupe \"Deuce\nCoupe\")_ for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet\ntechniques.
