The highest recorded maximum temperature in Tasmania is 42.2 °C\n(108.0 °F) at [Scamander](/wiki/Scamander,_Tasmania \"Scamander, Tasmania\") on\n30 January 2009, during the [2009 southeastern Australia heat\nwave](/wiki/Early_2009_southeastern_Australia_heat_wave \"Early 2009\nsoutheastern Australia heat wave\"). Tasmania's lowest recorded minimum\ntemperature is −13.0 °C (8.6 °F) on 30 June 1983, at [Butlers\nGorge](/wiki/Butlers_Gorge_Power_Station \"Butlers Gorge Power Station\"),\nShannon, and [Tarraleah](/wiki/Tarraleah,_Tasmania \"Tarraleah, Tasmania\").[1]\n\nRainfall in Tasmania is highly differentiated for a relatively compact island.\nIt follows a complicated pattern rather analogous to that found on large\ncontinents at the same latitude in the northern hemisphere. Rainfall increases\nfrom around 506 millimetres (19.9 in) at Ouse in the centre to 2,690\nmillimetres (106 in) at [Cradle Valley](/wiki/Cradle_Mountain \"Cradle\nMountain\") in the northwestern highlands.[2]\n\nSunshine is also highly differentiated, with average quotients ranging from\naround 4 hours a day (under 1500 hours a year) in the South West of the\nisland, up to around 7 hours daily (2550 hours annually) in the North East\naround the Launceston area.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Climate data\n  * 2 Rainfall\n  * 3 Summer\n  * 4 Winter\n  * 5 Spring\n  * 6 Autumn\n  * 7 Locations\n    * 7.1 Hobart\n    * 7.2 Launceston\n    * 7.3 Ouse\n    * 7.4 Burnie\n    * 7.5 Queenstown\n    * 7.6 Liawenee\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Climate\ndata[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Climate_of_Tasmania&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Climate data\")]\n\n[hide]Climate data for Tasmania  \n---  \nMonth | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec | Year  \nRecord high °C (°F) | 42.2  \n(108) | 40.1  \n(104.2) | 38.0  \n(100.4) | 32.0  \n(89.6) | 28.8  \n(83.8) | 22.0  \n(71.6) | 24.0  \n(75.2) | 25.0  \n(77) | 31.1  \n(88) | 34.6  \n(94.3) | 38.5  \n(101.3) | 39.8  \n(103.6) | 42.2  \n(108)  \nRecord low °C (°F) | −4.0  \n(24.8) | −4.0  \n(24.8) | −6.9  \n(19.6) | −7.7  \n(18.1) | −10.5  \n(13.1) | −13.0  \n(8.6) | −12.5  \n(9.5) | −11.1  \n(12) | −10.7  \n(12.7) | −8.5  \n(16.7) | −6.8  \n(19.8) | −5.0  \n(23) | −13.0  \n(8.6)  \nSource: Bureau of Meteorology[3]  \n  \n##\nRainfall[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Climate_of_Tasmania&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Rainfall\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Annual_average_rainfall_for_Tasmania_%281961-1990%29.png/300px-\nAnnual_average_rainfall_for_Tasmania_%281961-1990%29.png)](/wiki/File:Annual_average_rainfall_for_Tasmania_\\(1961-1990\\).png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Annual_average_rainfall_for_Tasmania_\\(1961-1990\\).png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nAnnual average rainfall for Tasmania (1961-1990)\n\nIn southern Australia (which includes Tasmania), most rain falls during the\nwinter months and is normally associated with [frontal\nsystems](/wiki/Frontal_system \"Frontal system\"). Elevation also has an\nimportant influence on rainfall, with the mountain areas of western Tasmania\nreceiving higher rainfall totals.[4]\n\nThe wettest part of the State is the west coast, where there is a strong\nwinter maximum in rainfall: January and February typically averages only one-\nthird the rainfall of July and August, though even in the driest months rain\nusually falls on every second day and the number of rainy days per year is\nmuch greater than on any part of the Australian mainland. Further east in the\n[Lake Country](/wiki/Lake_Country,_Tasmania \"Lake Country, Tasmania\"), annual\nrainfall declines to around 900 millimetres (35 in), whilst in the Midlands\n(i.e. further east again), annual rainfall is as low as 450 millimetres (18\nin) at Ross and generally below 600 millimetres (24 in). The eastern part of\nTasmania has rainfall more evenly distributed throughout the year than in the\nwest, and most months receive very similar averages.\n\nThe densely populated northern coast is much drier than the western side, with\nannual rainfall ranging from 666 millimetres (26.2 in) in Launceston to 955\nmillimetres (37.6 in) in Burnie in the north west and 993 millimetres (39.1\nin) in Scottsdale located further to the east.[5][6] Most rain falls in\nwinter, and in summer the average can be as low as 31 millimetres (1.2 in) per\nmonth in Launceston. The east coast is wetter than the Midlands, with an\naverage annual rainfall ranging from 775 millimetres (30.5 in) in St. Helens\nto around 640 millimetres (25 in) in Swansea.[7][8] Here the rainfall is\nevenly distributed over the year but can be very erratic as heavy rainfalls\nfrom the warm Tasman Sea are quite frequent. Whereas a three-day fall of 125\nmillimetres (4.9 in) occurs only once every fifty years on the north coast, it\noccurs on average once every four or five years around Swansea and Bicheno. On\n7–8 June 1954, there were many falls as large as 230 millimetres (9.1 in) in\ntwo days in that area. The east coast is sometimes called the \"sun coast\"\nbecause of its sunny climate.[9]\n\nIn the south-east, including Hobart, Spring receives slightly more rainfall\nthan Winter, and Spring also has slightly more rainy days than Winter.\n\n## Summer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Climate_of_Tasmania&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Summer\")]\n\nSummer is from December to February when the average maximum sea temperature\nis 21 °C (70 °F). On land, maximum temperatures average 20 °C (68 °F) to 24 °C\n(75 °F) along the coast and in the lowlands, such as around\n[Launceston](/wiki/Launceston,_Tasmania \"Launceston, Tasmania\"). The hottest\nareas of the state are in the valleys west of [Hobart](/wiki/Hobart \"Hobart\"),\nwhere summer temperatures regularly rise above 25 °C (77 °F). During\nheatwaves, temperatures in this region can rise above 40 °C (104 °F). The\nTasmanian highlands are much cooler, with [Liawenee](/wiki/Liawenee\n\"Liawenee\"), located on the [Central\nPlateau](/wiki/Central_Plateau_\\(Tasmania\\) \"Central Plateau \\(Tasmania\\)\"),\none of the coldest places in [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") with\ntemperatures in February ranging between 4 °C (39 °F) to 17 °C (63 °F).[10]\n\n## Winter[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Climate_of_Tasmania&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Winter\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Mount_Wellington_Winter.JPG/220px-\nMount_Wellington_Winter.JPG)](/wiki/File:Mount_Wellington_Winter.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mount_Wellington_Winter.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nSnow at Mount Wellington.\n\nThe winter months are June, July, and August, and are generally the wettest\nand coolest months in the state, with most elevated areas receiving\nconsiderable [snowfall](/wiki/Snowfall \"Snowfall\"). Winter maximums range from\n12 °C (54 °F) along the coast, to 3 °C (37 °F) on the Central Plateau, thanks\nto frequent [cold fronts](/wiki/Cold_front \"Cold front\") from the [Southern\nOcean](/wiki/Southern_Ocean \"Southern Ocean\"). Minimum temperatures however\nare warmer than mainland Australia, most of coastal Tasmania rarely drops\nbelow freezing and daily temperature variation is often very narrow. Elevated,\ninland areas can however drop below −10 °C (14 °F) during clear nights between\nfronts, while during snowy weather the maximum temperature may not rise above\n0 °C (32 °F).[11]\n\n## Spring[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Climate_of_Tasmania&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Spring\")]\n\nThe Spring months are September, October, and November. It is a season of\nfrequent changes, as winter weather patterns begin to take the shape of summer\npatterns, although snowfall is still common in mountainous areas until\nOctober. Spring is the windiest time of the year with afternoon sea breezes\nstarting to take effect on the coast.\n\n## Autumn[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Climate_of_Tasmania&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Autumn\")]\n\nAutumn is from March to May and is a season of transition, as summer weather\npatterns gradually take on the shape of winter patterns.\n\n##\nLocations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Climate_of_Tasmania&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Locations\")]\n\n### Hobart[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Climate_of_Tasmania&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Hobart\")]\n\n[Hobart](/wiki/Hobart \"Hobart\") has a mild temperate [oceanic\nclimate](/wiki/Oceanic_climate \"Oceanic climate\") ([Köppen climate\nclassification](/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification \"Köppen climate\nclassification\")), with four distinct [seasons](/wiki/Season \"Season\"). The\nhighest temperature recorded was 41.8°C on 4 January 2013 and the lowest was\n−2.8°C on 25 June 1972. Compared to other major Australia cities Hobart has\nthe second least daily average hours of sunshine, with 5.9 hours. (Melbourne\nhas the least) [12] The city rarely receives snow in winter; however, the\nadjacent [Mount Wellington](/wiki/Mount_Wellington_\\(Tasmania\\) \"Mount\nWellington \\(Tasmania\\)\") is often seen with a covering in winter, and it has\nreceived unseasonal snowfalls in all seasons, including summer. Though snow is\nunusual in general at sea level in Australia, Hobart has most probably had the\nmost sea level snowfalls out of any State Capital.\n\n  \n\n[hide]\n\n  * [v](/wiki/Template:Hobart_weatherbox \"Template:Hobart weatherbox\")\n  * [t](/wiki/Template_talk:Hobart_weatherbox \"Template talk:Hobart weatherbox\")\n  * [e](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Hobart_weatherbox&action=edit)\n\nClimate data for Ellerslie Road ([Battery Point](/wiki/Battery_Point,_Tasmania\n\"Battery Point, Tasmania\"))  \n---  \nMonth | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec | Year  \nRecord high °C (°F) | 41.8  \n(107.2) | 40.1  \n(104.2) | 37.3  \n(99.1) | 31.0  \n(87.8) | 25.7  \n(78.3) | 20.6  \n(69.1) | 22.1  \n(71.8) | 24.5  \n(76.1) | 31.0  \n(87.8) | 34.6  \n(94.3) | 36.8  \n(98.2) | 40.6  \n(105.1) | 41.8  \n(107.2)  \nAverage high °C (°F) | 22.2  \n(72) | 22.1  \n(71.8) | 20.3  \n(68.5) | 17.8  \n(64) | 15.1  \n(59.2) | 12.4  \n(54.3) | 12.3  \n(54.1) | 13.7  \n(56.7) | 15.4  \n(59.7) | 17.3  \n(63.1) | 18.9  \n(66) | 20.4  \n(68.7) | 17.3  \n(63.1)  \nDaily mean °C (°F) | 17.4  \n(63.3) | 17.4  \n(63.3) | 15.9  \n(60.6) | 13.6  \n(56.5) | 11.4  \n(52.5) | 8.9  \n(48) | 8.6  \n(47.5) | 9.7  \n(49.5) | 11.2  \n(52.2) | 12.8  \n(55) | 14.4  \n(57.9) | 15.9  \n(60.6) | 13.1  \n(55.6)  \nAverage low °C (°F) | 12.6  \n(54.7) | 12.6  \n(54.7) | 11.4  \n(52.5) | 9.4  \n(48.9) | 7.6  \n(45.7) | 5.3  \n(41.5) | 4.9  \n(40.8) | 5.7  \n(42.3) | 6.9  \n(44.4) | 8.3  \n(46.9) | 9.9  \n(49.8) | 11.3  \n(52.3) | 8.8  \n(47.8)  \nRecord low °C (°F) | 3.3  \n(37.9) | 3.4  \n(38.1) | 1.8  \n(35.2) | 0.7  \n(33.3) | −1.6  \n(29.1) | −2.8  \n(27) | −2.8  \n(27) | −1.8  \n(28.8) | −0.8  \n(30.6) | 0.0  \n(32) | 0.3  \n(32.5) | 3.3  \n(37.9) | −2.8  \n(27)  \nAverage rainfall mm (inches) | 44.4  \n(1.748) | 36.3  \n(1.429) | 39.3  \n(1.547) | 43.4  \n(1.709) | 36.0  \n(1.417) | 42.9  \n(1.689) | 47.3  \n(1.862) | 60.5  \n(2.382) | 58.7  \n(2.311) | 56.1  \n(2.209) | 47.7  \n(1.878) | 56.2  \n(2.213) | 568.7  \n(22.39)  \nAverage rainy days (≥ 0.2 mm) | 10.1 | 8.6 | 11.0 | 11.4 | 11.5 | 11.9 | 13.8 | 14.1 | 15.5 | 15.1 | 12.6 | 12.1 | 147.7  \nAverage afternoon [relative humidity](/wiki/Relative_humidity \"Relative humidity\") (%) | 51 | 51 | 54 | 57 | 60 | 64 | 62 | 56 | 54 | 52 | 53 | 51 | 55.4  \nMean monthly [sunshine hours](/wiki/Sunshine_duration \"Sunshine duration\") | 257.3 | 225.9 | 204.0 | 177.0 | 148.8 | 132.0 | 151.9 | 179.8 | 195.0 | 232.5 | 234.0 | 248.0 | 2,386.2  \nSource #1: [Bureau of Meteorology](/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology \"Bureau of\nMeteorology\") (1981–2010 averages;[13] extremes 1882–present)[14]  \nSource #2: [Bureau of Meteorology](/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology \"Bureau of\nMeteorology\"), [Hobart Airport](/wiki/Hobart_International_Airport \"Hobart\nInternational Airport\") (sunshine hours)[15]  \n  \n  \n\n###\nLaunceston[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Climate_of_Tasmania&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Launceston\")]\n\nMain article: [Climate of Launceston,\nTasmania](/wiki/Climate_of_Launceston,_Tasmania \"Climate of Launceston,\nTasmania\")\n\n[Launceston](/wiki/Launceston,_Tasmania \"Launceston, Tasmania\") has a mild,\n[temperate climate](/wiki/Temperate_climate \"Temperate climate\"),[16] with\nfour distinct seasons.
