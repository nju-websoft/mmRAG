In May 2010, Airbus announced that A380-900 development was postponed, until production of the A380-800 has stabilised.[12]  \n[Beriev Be-2500](/wiki/Beriev_Be-2500 \"Beriev Be-2500\") | 1980s proposal | Would be the largest aircraft ever, if built; development started in the 1980s  \n[Boeing New Large Airplane](/wiki/Boeing_New_Large_Airplane \"Boeing New Large Airplane\") | 1990s proposal | Planned as a replacement for the 747, to be powered by the same engines used on the [777](/wiki/Boeing_777 \"Boeing 777\"). Project canceled in the 1990s due to the airline industry's lack of interest for very large aircraft.  \n[Boeing Pelican](/wiki/Boeing_Pelican \"Boeing Pelican\") | 1990s proposal | Concept only for ground effect transport  \n[Boeing 2707](/wiki/Boeing_2707 \"Boeing 2707\") SST | 1960s design. A mockup was built but no prototype. | Planned as an answer to the Anglo-French [Concorde](/wiki/Concorde \"Concorde\") supersonic transport (SST). At 306 feet (93 m) long it would have been one of the longest airframes ever flown. Problems with the weight of the swing-wing mechanism and air friction heating in Mach 3 flight provoked a drastic redesign, by which time airline interest in SSTs was dropping because of environmental concerns. There was also political opposition to funding private industry. The U.S. Congress cut government funding in 1971 and airlines began canceling orders.  \n[McDonnell Douglas MD-12](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_MD-12 \"McDonnell Douglas MD-12\") | 1990 proposal | Proposed passenger aircraft, Designed to compete with the 747, project canceled in mid-1990s  \n[Sukhoi KR-860](/wiki/Sukhoi_KR-860 \"Sukhoi KR-860\") | 1990s proposal | KR-860 (_Kryl 'ya Rossii_ or \"Wings of Russia\") early named as SKD-717 is super large transport aircraft with weights about 650 tonnes (Antonov An-225 weight is 600 tonnes), payload about 300 tonnes (An-225 payload is 250 tonnes) and 860 to 1000 passengers, a proposed Double decker wide-body superjumbo jet by Russian aerospace company Sukhoi.  \n[Conroy Virtus](/wiki/Conroy_Virtus \"Conroy Virtus\") | 1974 | Proposed 140-metre wingspan aircraft capable of carrying Space Shuttle orbiter, or boosters, or Shuttle main tank  \n\"[Victory Bomber](/wiki/Victory_Bomber \"Victory Bomber\")\" | 1940/41 | Proposed 50-ton 52-metre wingspan design by Barnes Wallis able to carry a ten-ton [earthquake bomb](/wiki/Earthquake_bomb \"Earthquake bomb\") (of his own design) and drop it from 14,000 m on strategic targets in Germany.
