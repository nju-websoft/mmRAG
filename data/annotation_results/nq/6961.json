The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced\nlabour, and by 212 BC ran from [Gansu](/wiki/Gansu \"Gansu\") to the coast of\nsouthern [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria \"Manchuria\").\n\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense.\nThe [Han](/wiki/Han_dynasty \"Han dynasty\") (202 BC – 220 AD), the [Northern\nQi](/wiki/Northern_Qi \"Northern Qi\") (550–574), the [Sui](/wiki/Sui_dynasty\n\"Sui dynasty\") (589–618), and particularly the [Ming](/wiki/Ming_dynasty \"Ming\ndynasty\") (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded\nthe Walls, although they rarely followed Qin's routes. The Han extended the\nfortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990\nmi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-\nbuilding efforts. Conversely, the [Tang](/wiki/Tang_dynasty \"Tang dynasty\")\n(618–907), the [Song](/wiki/Song_dynasty \"Song dynasty\") (960–1279), the\n[Yuan](/wiki/Yuan_dynasty \"Yuan dynasty\") (1271–1368), and the\n[Qing](/wiki/Qing_dynasty \"Qing dynasty\") (1644–1911) mostly did not build\nfrontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat\nlike military campaigning and diplomacy.\n\nAlthough a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its\nhistory the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the\n[Manchu](/wiki/Manchu \"Manchu\") Qing marched through the gates of [Shanhai\nPass](/wiki/Shanhai_Pass \"Shanhai Pass\") and replaced the most ardent of the\nwall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China.\n\nThe Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as\nthey rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line\nthrough challenging terrain.[2] Some sections remain in relatively good\ncondition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed\nfor ideological reasons,[3] deconstructed for their building materials,[3] or\nlost due to the ravages of time.[4] For long an object of fascination for\nforeigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist\ndestination.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Geographical considerations\n  * 2 Pre-imperial China (7th century–221 BC)\n  * 3 Qin dynasty (221–206 BC)\n  * 4 Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD)\n  * 5 Period of Disunity to the Sui dynasty (220–618)\n  * 6 Tang dynasty (618–907)\n  * 7 Northern Song (960-1127)\n  * 8 Conquest dynasties (907-1368)\n    * 8.1 Liao dynasty frontier\n    * 8.2 The two walls of Jin dynasty\n    * 8.3 The Tangut Great Wall\n    * 8.4 The onset of the Mongols\n  * 9 Ming dynasty (1368–1644)\n    * 9.1 The early walls\n    * 9.2 The Walls of Xuanfu–Datong and the western reaches\n    * 9.3 From Beijing to Shanhai Pass\n  * 10 Qing dynasty (1644–1911)\n    * 10.1 Western appreciation of the Wall\n  * 11 Modern China (1911–present)\n  * 12 Historiography\n  * 13 See also\n  * 14 References\n  * 15 Bibliography\n\n## Geographical\nconsiderations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Geographical considerations\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Gobi_desert_map.png/300px-\nGobi_desert_map.png)](/wiki/File:Gobi_desert_map.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gobi_desert_map.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nTopographical map of China's northern frontier area, with modern political\nboundaries. [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria \"Manchuria\"), unmarked, is to the east\nof [Inner Mongolia](/wiki/Inner_Mongolia \"Inner Mongolia\").\n\nThe conflict between the Chinese and the nomads, from which the need for the\nGreat Wall arose, stemmed from differences in geography. The 15\"\n[isohyet](/wiki/Isohyet \"Isohyet\") marks the extent of settled agriculture,\ndividing the fertile fields of China to the south and the [semi-\narid](/wiki/Semi-arid_climate \"Semi-arid climate\") grasslands of Inner Asia to\nthe north.[6] The climates and the topography of the two regions led to\ndistinct modes of societal development.[7]\n\nAccording to the model by sinologist [Karl August\nWittfogel](/wiki/Karl_August_Wittfogel \"Karl August Wittfogel\"), the\n[loess](/wiki/Loess \"Loess\") soils of [Shaanxi](/wiki/Shaanxi \"Shaanxi\") made\nit possible for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on.\nAlthough this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the [Yellow\nRiver](/wiki/Yellow_River \"Yellow River\") valley,[8] such extensive waterworks\non an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could\nonly be managed by some form of bureaucracy.[9] Thus the [scholar-\nbureaucrats](/wiki/Scholar-official \"Scholar-official\") came to the fore to\nkeep track of the income and expenses of the [granaries](/wiki/Granary\n\"Granary\"). [Walled cities](/wiki/Chinese_city_wall \"Chinese city wall\") grew\nup around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of\nadministration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained\nwithin.[10] These cities combined to become [feudal\nstates](/wiki/Ancient_Chinese_states \"Ancient Chinese states\"), which\neventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model,\nwalls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of\nthe feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide\nprotection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.[9]\n\nThe steppe societies of Inner Asia, whose climate favoured a\n[pastoral](/wiki/Pastoral \"Pastoral\") economy, stood in stark contrast to the\nChinese mode of development. As animal herds are migratory by nature,\ncommunities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads.\nAccording to the influential Mongolist [Owen Lattimore](/wiki/Owen_Lattimore\n\"Owen Lattimore\") this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese\neconomic model.[11] As the steppe population grew, pastoral agriculture alone\ncould not support the population, and tribal alliances needed to be maintained\nby material rewards. For these needs, the nomads had to turn to the settled\nsocieties to get grains, metal tools, and luxury goods, which they could not\nproduce by themselves. If denied trade by the settled peoples, the nomads\nwould resort to raiding or even conquest.[12]\n\nPotential nomadic incursion from three main areas of Inner Asia caused concern\nto northern China: [Mongolia](/wiki/Mongolia \"Mongolia\") to the north,\n[Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria \"Manchuria\") to the northeast, and\n[Xinjiang](/wiki/Xinjiang \"Xinjiang\") to the northwest.[13] Of the three,\nChina's chief concern since the earliest times had been Mongolia – the home of\nmany of the country's fiercest enemies including the [Xiongnu](/wiki/Xiongnu\n\"Xiongnu\"), the [Xianbei](/wiki/Xianbei \"Xianbei\"), the\n[Khitans](/wiki/Khitans \"Khitans\"), and the [Mongols](/wiki/Mongols\n\"Mongols\"). The [Gobi Desert](/wiki/Gobi_Desert \"Gobi Desert\"), which accounts\nfor two-thirds of Mongolia's area, divided the main northern and southern\ngrazing lands and pushed the pastoral nomads to the fringes of the steppe. On\nthe southern side ([Inner Mongolia](/wiki/Inner_Mongolia \"Inner Mongolia\")),\nthis pressure brought the nomads into contact with China.[14]\n\nFor the most part, barring intermittent passes and valleys (the major one\nbeing the corridor through [Zhangjiakou](/wiki/Zhangjiakou \"Zhangjiakou\") and\nthe [Juyong Pass](/wiki/Juyong_Pass \"Juyong Pass\")), the [North China\nPlain](/wiki/North_China_Plain \"North China Plain\") remained shielded from the\nMongolian steppe by the [Yin Mountains](/wiki/Yin_Mountains \"Yin\nMountains\").[15] However, if this defence were breached, China's flat terrain\noffered no protection to the cities on the plain, including the imperial\ncapitals of [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing \"Beijing\"), [Kaifeng](/wiki/Kaifeng\n\"Kaifeng\"), and [Luoyang](/wiki/Luoyang \"Luoyang\").[16] Heading west along the\nYin Mountains, the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards\nupstream in the area known as the [Ordos Loop](/wiki/Ordos_Loop \"Ordos\nLoop\")—technically part of the steppe, but capable of irrigated agriculture.\nAlthough the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the\nnorth, such a border so far into the steppe was difficult to maintain. The\nlands south of the Yellow River—the [Hetao](/wiki/Hetao \"Hetao\"), the [Ordos\nDesert](/wiki/Ordos_Desert \"Ordos Desert\"), and the [Loess\nPlateau](/wiki/Loess_Plateau \"Loess Plateau\")—provided no natural barriers on\nthe approach to the [Wei River](/wiki/Wei_River \"Wei River\") valley, the oft-\ncalled cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital\n[Xi'an](/wiki/Xi%27an \"Xi'an\") lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained\nextremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence\nover the steppe, but also for the security of [China\nproper](/wiki/China_proper \"China proper\"). The region's strategic importance\ncombined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls\nhere.[17]\n\nAlthough Manchuria is home to the agricultural lands of the [Liao\nRiver](/wiki/Liao_River \"Liao River\") valley, its location beyond the northern\nmountains relegated it to the relative periphery of Chinese concern. When\nChinese state control became weak, at various points in history Manchuria fell\nunder the control of the forest peoples of the area, including the\n[Jurchens](/wiki/Jurchens \"Jurchens\") and the [Manchus](/wiki/Manchus\n\"Manchus\"). The most crucial route that links Manchuria and the North China\nPlain is a narrow coastal strip of land, wedged between the [Bohai\nSea](/wiki/Bohai_Sea \"Bohai Sea\") and the [Yan Mountains](/wiki/Yan_Mountains\n\"Yan Mountains\"), called the [Shanhai Pass](/wiki/Shanhai_Pass \"Shanhai Pass\")\n(literally the \"mountain and sea pass\").[18] The pass gained much importance\nduring the later dynasties, when the capital was set in Beijing, a mere 300\nkilometres (190 miles) away. In addition to the Shanhai Pass, a handful of\nmountain passes also provide access from Manchuria into China through the [Yan\nMountains](/wiki/Yan_Mountains \"Yan Mountains\"), chief among them the\n[Gubeikou](/wiki/Gubeikou \"Gubeikou\") and\n[Xifengkou](/w/index.php?title=Xifengkou&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Xifengkou\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") ([Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters\n\"Traditional Chinese characters\"): 喜峰口).[19]\n\nXinjiang, considered part of the [Turkestan](/wiki/Turkestan \"Turkestan\")\nregion, consists of an amalgamation of deserts, oases, and dry steppe barely\nsuitable for agriculture.[18] When influence from the steppe powers of\nMongolia waned, the various [Central Asian](/wiki/Central_Asia \"Central Asia\")\noasis kingdoms and nomadic clans like the [Göktürks](/wiki/G%C3%B6kt%C3%BCrks\n\"Göktürks\") and [Uyghurs](/wiki/Uyghurs \"Uyghurs\") were able to form their own\nstates and confederations that threatened China at times. China proper is\nconnected to this area by the [Hexi Corridor](/wiki/Hexi_Corridor \"Hexi\nCorridor\"), a narrow string of oases bounded by the Gobi Desert to the north\nand the high [Tibetan Plateau](/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau \"Tibetan Plateau\") to the\nsouth.[20] In addition to considerations of frontier defence, the Hexi\nCorridor also formed an important part of the [Silk Road](/wiki/Silk_Road\n\"Silk Road\") trade route. Thus it was also in China's economic interest to\ncontrol this stretch of land, and hence the Great Wall's western terminus is\nin this corridor—the [Yumen Pass](/wiki/Yumen_Pass \"Yumen Pass\") during Han\ntimes and the [Jiayu Pass](/wiki/Jiayu_Pass \"Jiayu Pass\") during the Ming\ndynasty and thereafter.[21]\n\n## Pre-imperial China (7th century–221\nBC)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Pre-imperial China \\(7th century–221 BC\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Great_wall_of_qi_2008_07_14.jpg/220px-\nGreat_wall_of_qi_2008_07_14.jpg)](/wiki/File:Great_wall_of_qi_2008_07_14.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Great_wall_of_qi_2008_07_14.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRemnants of the [Great Wall of Qi](/wiki/Great_Wall_of_Qi \"Great Wall of Qi\")\non Dafeng Mountain, Changqing District, [Jinan](/wiki/Jinan \"Jinan\"), which\nwas once part of the ancient [State of Qi](/wiki/Qi_\\(state\\) \"Qi \\(state\\)\")\nduring the [Warring States Period](/wiki/Warring_States_Period \"Warring States\nPeriod\").\n\nOne of the first mentions of a wall built against northern invaders is found\nin a poem, dated from the seventh century BC, recorded in the _[Classic of\nPoetry](/wiki/Classic_of_Poetry \"Classic of Poetry\")_. The poem tells of a\nking, now identified as [King Xuan](/wiki/King_Xuan_of_Zhou \"King Xuan of\nZhou\") (r. 827 – 782 BC) of the [Western Zhou\ndynasty](/wiki/Western_Zhou_dynasty \"Western Zhou dynasty\") (1046 – 771 BC),\nwho commanded General Nan Zhong (南仲) to build a wall in the northern regions\nto fend off the [Xianyun](/wiki/Xianyun \"Xianyun\").[22] The Xianyun, whose\nbase of power was in the Ordos region, were regarded as part of the\ncharioteering [Rong](/wiki/Xirong_\\(people\\) \"Xirong \\(people\\)\") tribes,[23]\nand their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of\n[Haojing](/wiki/Haojing \"Haojing\") were probably the reason for King Xuan's\nresponse.[22] Nan Zhong's campaign was recorded as a great victory. However,\nonly a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people, the\n[Quanrong](/wiki/Quanrong \"Quanrong\"), responded to a summons by the renegade\n[Marquess of Shen](/wiki/Marquess_of_Shen \"Marquess of Shen\") by over-running\nthe Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital. The cataclysmic event\nkilled King Xuan's successor [King You](/wiki/King_You_of_Zhou \"King You of\nZhou\") (795–771 BC), forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou\n(成周, later known as [Luoyang](/wiki/Luoyang \"Luoyang\")) a year later, and thus\nushered in the [Eastern Zhou dynasty](/wiki/Eastern_Zhou_dynasty \"Eastern Zhou\ndynasty\") (770–256 BC). Most importantly, the fall of Western Zhou\nredistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou's nominal\nrulership. The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody\ninterstate anarchy. With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging\nconstant war upon one another, many rulers came to feel the need to erect\nwalls to protect their borders. Of the earliest textual reference to such a\nwall was the [State of Chu](/wiki/State_of_Chu \"State of Chu\")'s wall of 656\nBC, 1,400 metres (4,600 feet) of which were excavated in southern\n[Henan](/wiki/Henan \"Henan\") province in the modern era. However the Chu\nborder fortifications consisted of many individual mountain fortresses; they\ndo not constitute to a lengthy, single wall. The [State of\nQi](/wiki/State_of_Qi \"State of Qi\") also had fortified borders up by the 7th\ncentury BC, and the extant portions in [Shandong](/wiki/Shandong \"Shandong\")\nprovince had been christened the [Great Wall of Qi](/wiki/Great_Wall_of_Qi\n\"Great Wall of Qi\"). The [State of Wei](/wiki/State_of_Wei \"State of Wei\")\nbuilt two walls, the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356\nBC, with the extant western wall found in [Hancheng](/wiki/Hancheng\n\"Hancheng\"), [Shaanxi](/wiki/Shaanxi \"Shaanxi\").[24] Even non-Chinese peoples\nbuilt walls, such as the [Di](/wiki/Beidi \"Beidi\") state of\n[Zhongshan](/wiki/Zhongshan_\\(state\\) \"Zhongshan \\(state\\)\") and the\n[Yiqu](/wiki/Yiqu \"Yiqu\") Rong, whose walls were intended to defend against\nthe [State of Qin](/wiki/State_of_Qin \"State of Qin\").[25]\n\nOf these walls, those of the northern states [Yan](/wiki/Yan_\\(state\\) \"Yan\n\\(state\\)\"), [Zhao](/wiki/Zhao_\\(state\\) \"Zhao \\(state\\)\"), and Qin were\nconnected by Qin Shi Huang when he united the Chinese states in 221 BC.[25]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/GreatWallChina1.png/300px-\nGreatWallChina1.png)](/wiki/File:GreatWallChina1.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GreatWallChina1.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nMap of the Warring States and their frontier walls\n\nThe State of Yan, the easternmost of the three northern states, began to erect\nwalls after the general [Qin Kai](/wiki/Qin_Kai_\\(general\\) \"Qin Kai\n\\(general\\)\") drove the [Donghu](/wiki/Donghu_people \"Donghu people\") people\nback \"a thousand _[li](/wiki/Li_\\(unit\\) \"Li \\(unit\\)\")_ \" during the reign of\n[King Zhao](/w/index.php?title=King_Zhao_of_Yan&action=edit&redlink=1 \"King\nZhao of Yan \\(page does not exist\\)\") (燕昭王; r. 311–279 BC).[26] The Yan wall\nstretched from the [Liaodong peninsula](/wiki/Liaodong_peninsula \"Liaodong\npeninsula\"), through [Chifeng](/wiki/Chifeng \"Chifeng\"), and into northern\n[Hebei](/wiki/Hebei \"Hebei\"), possibly bringing its western terminus near the\nZhao walls.[27] Another Yan wall was erected to the south to defend against\nthe Zhao; it was southwest of present-day Beijing and ran parallel to the\n[Juma River](/wiki/Juma_River_\\(China\\) \"Juma River \\(China\\)\") for several\ndozen miles.[28]\n\nThe Zhao walls to the north were built under [King Wuling of\nZhao](/wiki/King_Wuling_of_Zhao \"King Wuling of Zhao\") (r. 325–299 BC), whose\ngroundbreaking introduction of nomadic cavalry into his army reshaped Chinese\nwarfare and gave Zhao an initial advantage over his opponents. He attacked the\n[Xiongnu](/wiki/Xiongnu \"Xiongnu\") tribes of Linhu (林胡) and Loufan (樓煩) to the\nnorth, then waged war on the state of Zhongshan until it was annexed in 296\nBC. In the process, he constructed the northernmost fortified frontier deep in\nnomadic territory.[29] The Zhao walls were dated in the 1960s to be from King\nWuling's reign:[30] a southern long wall in northern [Henan](/wiki/Henan\n\"Henan\") encompassing the [Yanmen Pass](/wiki/Yanmen_Pass \"Yanmen Pass\");[31]\na second line of barricades encircling the [Ordos Loop](/wiki/Ordos_Loop\n\"Ordos Loop\"), extending from [Zhangjiakou](/wiki/Zhangjiakou \"Zhangjiakou\")\nin the east to the ancient fortress of Gaoque (高闕) in the [Urad Front\nBanner](/wiki/Urad_Front_Banner \"Urad Front Banner\"); and a third,\nnorthernmost line along the southern slopes of the [Yin\nMountains](/wiki/Yin_Mountains \"Yin Mountains\"), extending from\n[Qinghe](/wiki/Qinghe_County,_Hebei \"Qinghe County, Hebei\") in the east,\npassing north of [Hohhot](/wiki/Hohhot \"Hohhot\"), and into\n[Baotou](/wiki/Baotou \"Baotou\").[32]\n\nQin was originally a state on the western fringe of the Chinese political\nsphere, but it grew into a formidable power in the later parts of the [Warring\nStates period](/wiki/Warring_States_period \"Warring States period\") when it\naggressively expanded in all directions. In the north, the state of Wei and\nthe Yiqu built walls to protect themselves from Qin aggression, but were still\nunable to stop Qin from eating into their territories. The Qin reformist\n[Shang Yang](/wiki/Shang_Yang \"Shang Yang\") forced the Wei out of their walled\narea west of the Yellow River in 340 BC, and [King Huiwen of\nQin](/wiki/King_Huiwen_of_Qin \"King Huiwen of Qin\") (r. 338–311 BC) took 25\nYiqu forts in a northern offensive.[33] When King Huiwen died, his widow the\n[Queen Dowager Xuan](/wiki/Queen_Dowager_Xuan \"Queen Dowager Xuan\") acted as\nregent because the succeeding sons were deemed too young to govern. During the\nreign of [King Zhaoxiang](/wiki/King_Zhaoxiang_of_Qin \"King Zhaoxiang of Qin\")\n(r. 306–251 BC), the queen dowager apparently entered illicit relations with\nthe Yiqu king and gave birth to two of his sons, but later tricked and killed\nthe Yiqu king. Following that coup, the Qin army marched into Yiqu territory\nat the queen dowager's orders; the Qin annihilated the Yiqu remnants and thus\ncame to possess the Ordos region.[34] At this point the Qin built a wall\naround their new territories to defend against the true nomads even further\nnorth, incorporating the Wei walls. As a result, an estimated total of 1,775\nkilometres (1,103 mi) of Qin walls (including spurts) extended from southern\n[Gansu](/wiki/Gansu \"Gansu\") to the bank of the Yellow River in the [Jungar\nBanner](/wiki/Jungar_Banner \"Jungar Banner\"), close to the border with Zhao at\nthe time.[35]\n\nThe walls, known as _Changcheng_ (長城) – literally \"long walls\", but often\ntranslated as \"Great Wall\"[36] – were mostly constructed of [tamped\nearth](/wiki/Tamped_earth \"Tamped earth\"), with some parts built with stones.\nWhere natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence, the walls\nwere erected sparingly, but long fortified lines were laid where such\nadvantageous terrains did not exist. Often in addition to the wall, the\ndefensive system included garrisons and [beacon\ntowers](/wiki/Beacon#For_defensive_communications \"Beacon\") inside the wall,\nand [watchtowers](/wiki/Watchtowers \"Watchtowers\") outside at regular\nintervals.[37] In terms of defence, the walls were generally effective at\ncountering cavalry [shock tactics](/wiki/Shock_tactics \"Shock tactics\"),[38]\nbut there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive\nin nature. Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were\nbuilt far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands, and so rather\nthan being defensive, the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three\nnorthern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial\nacquisitions.[39] This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of\nnomadic artifacts within the walls, suggesting the presence of pre-existing or\nconquered barbarian societies.[40] It is entirely possible, as Western\nscholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest, that nomadic aggression against\nthe Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism\nduring this period.[41]\n\n## Qin dynasty (221–206\nBC)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Qin dynasty \\(221–206 BC\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/GreatWallofQinDynasty.png/220px-\nGreatWallofQinDynasty.png)](/wiki/File:GreatWallofQinDynasty.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GreatWallofQinDynasty.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nQin dynasty frontier walls\n\nIn 221 BC, the state of Qin completed its [conquest over the other Warring\nStates](/wiki/Qin%27s_wars_of_unification \"Qin's wars of unification\") and\nunited China under [Qin Shi Huang](/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang \"Qin Shi Huang\"), the\nfirst [emperor of China](/wiki/Emperor_of_China \"Emperor of China\"). These\nconquests, combined with the [Legalist](/wiki/Legalism_\\(Chinese_philosophy\\)\n\"Legalism \\(Chinese philosophy\\)\") reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th\ncentury BC, transformed China from a loose confederation of [feudal\nstates](/wiki/Examples_of_feudalism#China \"Examples of feudalism\") to an\nauthoritarian [empire](/wiki/Empire \"Empire\"). With the transformation, Qin\nbecame able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in\npublic works than the prior feudal kingdoms.[42] Also, once unification was\nachieved, Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no\nmore internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them.[43]\nSoon after the conquests, in the year 215 BC, the emperor sent the famed\ngeneral [Meng Tian](/wiki/Meng_Tian \"Meng Tian\") to the Ordos region to drive\nout the [Xiongnu](/wiki/Xiongnu \"Xiongnu\") nomads settled there, who had risen\nfrom beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier. [Qin's\ncampaign against the Xiongnu](/wiki/Qin%27s_campaign_against_the_Xiongnu\n\"Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu\") was preemptive in nature, since there\nwas no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time; its aim was to annexe\nthe ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin's\nnorthern borders.[44] Once the Xiongnu were chased away, Meng Tian introduced\n30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories.[45]\n\nWall configurations were changed to reflect the new borders under the Qin.\nGeneral Meng Tian erected walls beyond the northern loop of the Yellow River,\neffectively linking the border walls of Qin, Zhao, and Yan. Concurrent to the\nbuilding of the frontier wall was the destruction of the walls within China\nthat used to divide one warring state from another—contrary to the outer\nwalls, which were built to stabilize the newly united China, the inner walls\nthreatened the unity of the empire. In the following year, 214 BC, Qin Shi\nHuang ordered new fortifications to be built along the Yellow River to the\nwest of the Ordos while work continued in the north. This work was completed\nprobably by 212 BC, signalled by Qin Shi Huang's imperial tour of inspection\nand the construction of the Direct Road (直道) connecting the capital\n[Xianyang](/wiki/Xianyang \"Xianyang\") with the Ordos.[46] The result was a\nseries of long walls running from Gansu to the seacoast in Manchuria.[47]\n\nDetails of the construction were not found in the [official\nhistories](/wiki/Official_history \"Official history\"),[48] but it could be\ninferred that the construction conditions were made especially difficult by\nthe long stretches of mountains and semi-desert that the Great Wall traversed,\nthe sparse populations of these areas, and the frigid winter climate. Although\nthe walls were rammed earth, so the bulk of the building material could be\nfound _in situ_ , transportation of additional supplies and labour remained\ndifficult for the reasons named above. The sinologist [Derk\nBodde](/wiki/Derk_Bodde \"Derk Bodde\") posits in _[The Cambridge History of\nChina](/wiki/The_Cambridge_History_of_China \"The Cambridge History of China\")_\nthat \"for every man whom Meng Tian could put to work at the scene of actual\nconstruction, dozens must have been needed to build approaching roads and to\ntransport supplies.\"[49] This is supported by the Han dynasty statesman [Zhufu\nYan](/wiki/Zhufu_Yan \"Zhufu Yan\")'s description of Qin Shi Huang's Ordos\nproject in 128 BC:\n\n> ... the land was brackish and arid, crops could not be grown on them. ... At\n> the time, the young men being drafted were forced to haul boats and barges\n> loaded with baggage trains upstream to sustain a steady supply of food and\n> fodder to the front. ... Commencing at the departure point a man and his\n> animal could carry thirty _zhong_ (about 176 kilograms (388 lb)) of food\n> supply, by the time they arrived at the destination, they merely delivered\n> one _[dan](/wiki/Picul \"Picul\")_ (about 29 kilograms (64 lb)) of supply. ...\n> When the populace had become tired and weary they started to dissipate and\n> abscond. The orphans, the frail, the widowed and the seniors were\n> desperately trying to escape from their appallingly derelict state and died\n> on the wayside as they wandered away from their home. People started to\n> revolt.[50]\n\nThe settlement of the north continued up to Qin Shi Huang's death in 210 BC,\nupon which Meng Tian was ordered to commit suicide in a succession conspiracy.\nBefore killing himself, Meng Tian expressed regret for his walls: \"Beginning\nat Lintao and reaching to Liaodong, I built walls and dug moats for more than\nten thousand _li_ ; was it not inevitable that I broke the earth's veins along\nthe way? This then was my offense.\"[51]\n\nMeng Tian's settlements in the north were abandoned, and the Xiongnu nomads\nmoved back into the Ordos Loop as the Qin empire became consumed by widespread\nrebellion due to public discontent. Owen Lattimore concluded that the whole\nproject relied upon military power to enforce agriculture on a land more\nsuited for herding, resulting in \"the anti-historical paradox of attempting\ntwo mutually exclusive forms of development simultaneously\" that was doomed to\nfail.[45]\n\n## Han dynasty (206 BC–220\nAD)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Han dynasty \\(206 BC–220 AD\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/GreatWallChina2.png/220px-\nGreatWallChina2.png)](/wiki/File:GreatWallChina2.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:GreatWallChina2.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nWestern Han dynasty frontier walls and the extent of its territory\n\nSee also: [History of the Han dynasty](/wiki/History_of_the_Han_dynasty\n\"History of the Han dynasty\")\n\nIn 202 BC, the former peasant [Liu Bang](/wiki/Liu_Bang \"Liu Bang\") emerged\nvictorious from the [Chu–Han Contention](/wiki/Chu%E2%80%93Han_Contention\n\"Chu–Han Contention\") that followed the rebellion that toppled the Qin\ndynasty, and proclaimed himself Emperor of the [Han dynasty](/wiki/Han_dynasty\n\"Han dynasty\"), becoming known as Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202–195 BC) to\nposterity. Unable to address the problem of the resurgent Xiongnu in the Ordos\nregion through military means, Emperor Gaozu was forced to appease the\nXiongnu. In exchange for peace, the Han offered tributes along with princesses\nto marry off to the Xiongnu chiefs. These diplomatic marriages would become\nknown as _[heqin](/wiki/Heqin \"Heqin\")_ , and the terms specified that the\nGreat Wall (determined to be either the Warring States period Qin state\nwall[52] or a short stretch of wall south of [Yanmen Pass](/wiki/Yanmen_Pass\n\"Yanmen Pass\")[53]) was to serve as the line across which neither party would\nventure.[54] In 162 BC, Gaozu's son [Emperor Wen](/wiki/Emperor_Wen_of_Han\n\"Emperor Wen of Han\") clarified the agreement, suggesting the Xiongnu\n_[chanyu](/wiki/Chanyu \"Chanyu\")_ held authority north of the Wall and the Han\nemperor held authority south of it.[55] [Sima Qian](/wiki/Sima_Qian \"Sima\nQian\"), the author of the _[Records of the Grand\nHistorian](/wiki/Records_of_the_Grand_Historian \"Records of the Grand\nHistorian\")_ , describes the result of this agreement as one of peace and\nfriendship: \"from the chanyu downwards, all the Xiongnu grew friendly with the\nHan, coming and going along the Long Wall\".[56] However, Chinese records show\nthat the Xiongnu often did not respect the agreement, as the Xiongnu cavalry\nnumbering up to 100,000 made several intrusions into Han territory despite the\nintermarriage.[57]\n\nTo Chinese minds, the _heqin_ policy was humiliating and ran contrary to the\n[Sinocentric](/wiki/Sinocentrism \"Sinocentrism\") world order like \"a person\nhanging upside down\", as the statesman [Jia Yi](/wiki/Jia_Yi \"Jia Yi\") (d. 169\nBC) puts it.[56] These sentiments manifested themselves in the Han court in\nthe form of the pro-war faction, who advocated the reversal of Han's policy of\nappeasement. By the reign of [Emperor Wu](/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Han \"Emperor Wu\nof Han\") (r. 141–87 BC), the Han felt comfortable enough to go to war with the\nXiongnu. After a botched attempt at luring the Xiongnu army into an ambush at\nthe [Battle of Mayi](/wiki/Battle_of_Mayi \"Battle of Mayi\") in 133 BC,[58] the\nera of _heqin_ -style appeasement was broken and the [Han–Xiongnu\nWar](/wiki/Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu_War \"Han–Xiongnu War\") went into full\nswing.[59]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Summer_Vacation_2007%2C_263%2C_Watchtower_In_The_Morning_Light%2C_Dunhuang%2C_Gansu_Province.jpg/250px-\nSummer_Vacation_2007%2C_263%2C_Watchtower_In_The_Morning_Light%2C_Dunhuang%2C_Gansu_Province.jpg)](/wiki/File:Summer_Vacation_2007,_263,_Watchtower_In_The_Morning_Light,_Dunhuang,_Gansu_Province.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Summer_Vacation_2007,_263,_Watchtower_In_The_Morning_Light,_Dunhuang,_Gansu_Province.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe ruins of a [Han dynasty](/wiki/Han_dynasty \"Han dynasty\") (202 BC – 220\nAD) Chinese watchtower made of [rammed earth](/wiki/Rammed_earth \"Rammed\nearth\"), Gansu province.

In 127 BC, General [Wei\nQing](/wiki/Wei_Qing \"Wei Qing\") invaded the much-contested Ordos region as\nfar as the Qin fortifications set up by Meng Tian. In this way, Wei Qing\nreconquered the irrigable lands north of the Ordos and restored the spur of\ndefences protecting that territory from the steppe.[60] In addition to\nrebuilding the walls, archeologists believe that the Han also erected\nthousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor\nWu's reign.[61] The fortifications here include embankments, beacon stations,\nand forts, all constructed with a combination of tamped-earth cores and stone\nfrontages.[62] From the Ordos Loop, the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great\nWall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of\n[Wuwei](/wiki/Wuwei,_Gansu \"Wuwei, Gansu\"), [Zhangye](/wiki/Zhangye\n\"Zhangye\"), and [Jiuquan](/wiki/Jiuquan \"Jiuquan\"), leading into the [Juyan\nLake Basin](/wiki/Juyan_Lake_Basin \"Juyan Lake Basin\"), and terminating in two\nplaces: the [Yumen Pass](/wiki/Yumen_Pass \"Yumen Pass\") in the north, or the\n[Yang Pass](/wiki/Yang_Pass \"Yang Pass\") to the south, both in the vicinity of\n[Dunhuang](/wiki/Dunhuang \"Dunhuang\").[63] Yumen Pass was the most westerly of\nall Han Chinese fortifications – further west than the western terminus of the\nMing Great Wall at [Jiayu Pass](/wiki/Jiayuguan_\\(pass\\) \"Jiayuguan\n\\(pass\\)\"), about 460 kilometres (290 mi) to the east. The garrisons of the\nwatchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military\nagricultural colonies known as _[tuntian](/wiki/Tuntian \"Tuntian\")_. Behind\nthis line of fortifications, the Han government was able to maintain its\nsettlements and its communications to the [Western\nRegions](/wiki/Western_Regions \"Western Regions\") in central Asia, generally\nsecure from attacks from the north.[64]\n\nThe campaigns against the Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples of the west\nexhausted the imperial treasury, and the expansionist policies were reverted\nin favour of peace under Emperor Wu's successors. The peace was largely\nrespected even when the Han throne was usurped by the minister [Wang\nMang](/wiki/Wang_Mang \"Wang Mang\") in 9 AD, beginning a brief 15-year\ninterregnum known as the [Xin dynasty](/wiki/Xin_dynasty \"Xin dynasty\")\n(9–23). Despite high tensions between the Xin and the Xiongnu resulting in the\ndeployment of 300,000 men on the Great Wall, no major fighting broke out\nbeyond minor raids.[65] Instead, popular discontent led to banditry and,\nultimately, full-scale rebellion. The civil war ended with the Liu clan on the\nthrone again, beginning the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220).[66]\n\nThe restorer [Emperor Guangwu](/wiki/Emperor_Guangwu_of_Han \"Emperor Guangwu\nof Han\") (r. 25–57 AD) initiated several projects to consolidate his control\nwithin the frontier regions. Defense works were established to the east of the\nYanmen Pass, with a line of fortifications and beacon fires stretching from\nPingcheng County (present-day [Datong](/wiki/Datong \"Datong\")) through the\nvalley of the [Sanggan River](/wiki/Sanggan_River \"Sanggan River\") to [Dai\nCounty](/wiki/Dai_County \"Dai County\"), Shanxi.[67] By 38 AD, as a result of\nraids by the Xiongnu further to the west against the Wei River valley, orders\nwere given for a series of walls to be constructed as defences for the [Fen\nRiver](/wiki/Fen_River \"Fen River\"), the southward course of the Yellow River,\nand the region of the former imperial capital, Chang'an.[68] These\nconstructions were defensive in nature, which marked a shift from the\noffensive walls of the preceding Emperor Wu and the rulers of the Warring\nStates. By the early 40s AD the northern frontiers of China had undergone\ndrastic change: the line of the imperial frontier followed not the advanced\npositions conquered by Emperor Wu but the rear defences indicated roughly by\nthe modern (Ming dynasty) Great Wall. The Ordos region, northern Shanxi, and\nthe upper [Luan River](/wiki/Luan_River \"Luan River\") basin around\n[Chengde](/wiki/Chengde \"Chengde\")[69] were abandoned and left to the control\nof the Xiongnu.[70] The rest of the frontier remained somewhat intact until\nthe [end of the Han dynasty](/wiki/End_of_the_Han_dynasty \"End of the Han\ndynasty\"), with the [Dunhuang manuscripts](/wiki/Dunhuang_manuscripts\n\"Dunhuang manuscripts\") (discovered in 1900) indicating that the military\nestablishment in the northwest was maintained for most of the Eastern Han\nperiod.[71]\n\n## Period of Disunity to the Sui dynasty\n(220–618)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Period of Disunity to the Sui dynasty \\(220–618\\)\")]\n\nFollowing the end of the Han dynasty in 220, China disintegrated into warlord\nstates, which in 280 were briefly reunited under the [Western\nJin](/wiki/Western_Jin \"Western Jin\") dynasty (265–316). There are ambiguous\naccounts of the Jin rebuilding the Qin wall,[72] but these walls apparently\noffered no resistance during the [Wu Hu uprising](/wiki/Wu_Hu_uprising \"Wu Hu\nuprising\"), when the nomadic tribes of the steppe evicted the Chinese court\nfrom northern China. What followed was a succession of short-lived states in\nnorthern China known as the [Sixteen Kingdoms](/wiki/Sixteen_Kingdoms \"Sixteen\nKingdoms\"), until they were all consolidated by the [Xianbei](/wiki/Xianbei\n\"Xianbei\")-led [Northern Wei](/wiki/Northern_Wei \"Northern Wei\") dynasty\n(386–535).[73]\n\nAs Northern Wei became more economically dependent on agriculture, the Xianbei\nemperors made a conscious decision to adopt Chinese customs, including passive\nmethods of frontier defence. In 423, a defence line over 2,000 _li_ (1,080\nkilometres (670 mi)) long was built to resist the [Rouran](/wiki/Rouran\n\"Rouran\"); its path roughly followed the old Zhao wall from\n[Chicheng](/wiki/Chicheng \"Chicheng\") County in Hebei Province to [Wuyuan\nCounty, Inner Mongolia](/wiki/Wuyuan_County,_Inner_Mongolia \"Wuyuan County,\nInner Mongolia\").[74] In 446, 100,000 men were put to work building an inner\nwall from [Yanqing](/wiki/Yanqing_County \"Yanqing County\"), passing south of\nthe Wei capital [Pingcheng](/wiki/Pingcheng \"Pingcheng\"), and ending up near\nPingguan on the eastern bank of the Yellow River. The two walls formed the\nbasis of the double-layered [Xuanfu](/wiki/Xuanfu\n\"Xuanfu\")–[Datong](/wiki/Datong \"Datong\") wall system that protected Beijing a\nthousand years later during the Ming dynasty.[75]\n\nThe Northern Wei collapsed in 535 due to civil insurrection to be eventually\nsucceeded by the [Northern Qi](/wiki/Northern_Qi \"Northern Qi\") (550–575) and\n[Northern Zhou](/wiki/Northern_Zhou \"Northern Zhou\") (557–580). Faced with the\nthreat of the [Göktürks](/wiki/G%C3%B6kt%C3%BCrks \"Göktürks\") from the north,\nfrom 552 to 556 the Qi built up to 3,000 _li_ (about 1,600 kilometres (990\nmi)) of wall from Shanxi to the sea at [Shanhai Pass](/wiki/Shanhai_Pass\n\"Shanhai Pass\").[76] Over the course of the year 555 alone, 1.8 million men\nwere mobilized to build the [Juyong Pass](/wiki/Juyong_Pass \"Juyong Pass\") and\nextend its wall by 450 kilometres (280 mi) through Datong to the eastern banks\nof the Yellow River.[77] In 557 a secondary wall was built inside the main\none.[72] These walls were built quickly from local earth and stones or formed\nby natural barriers. Two stretches of the stone-and-earth Qi wall still stand\nin Shanxi today, measuring 3.3 metres (11 ft) wide at their bases and 3.5\nmetres (11 ft) high on average.[77] In 577 the Northern Zhou conquered the\nNorthern Qi and in 580 made repairs to the existing Qi walls. The route of the\nQi and Zhou walls would be mostly followed by the later Ming wall west of\n[Gubeikou](/wiki/Gubeikou \"Gubeikou\"),[76] which includes reconstructed walls\nfrom Qi and Zhou.[72] In more recent times, the reddish remnants of the Zhou\nramparts in Hebei gave rise to the nickname \"Red Wall\".[77]\n\nThe [Sui](/wiki/Sui_dynasty \"Sui dynasty\") took power from the Northern Zhou\nin 581 before reuniting China in 589. Sui's founding emperor, [Emperor Wen of\nSui](/wiki/Emperor_Wen_of_Sui \"Emperor Wen of Sui\") (r. 581–604), carried out\nconsiderable wall construction in 581 in Hebei and Shanxi to defend against\n[Ishbara Qaghan](/wiki/Ishbara_Qaghan \"Ishbara Qaghan\") of the Göktürks. The\nnew walls proved insufficient in 582 when Ishbara Qaghan avoided them by\nriding west to raid Gansu and Shaanxi with 400,000 archers.[78] Between 585\nand 588 Emperor Wen sought to close this gap by putting walls up in the Ordos\nMountains (between [Suide](/wiki/Suide \"Suide\") and [Lingwu](/wiki/Lingwu\n\"Lingwu\")) and Inner Mongolia. In 586 as many as 150,000 men are recorded as\ninvolved in the construction.[79] Emperor Wen's son [Emperor\nYang](/wiki/Emperor_Yang_of_Sui \"Emperor Yang of Sui\") (r. 604–618) continued\nto build walls. In 607–608 he sent over a million men to build a wall from\n[Yulin](/wiki/Yulin,_Shaanxi \"Yulin, Shaanxi\") to near [Huhhot](/wiki/Huhhot\n\"Huhhot\")[72] to protect the newly refurbished eastern capital\n[Luoyang](/wiki/Luoyang \"Luoyang\").[80] Part of the Sui wall survives to this\nday in Inner Mongolia as earthen ramparts some 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) high\nwith towers rising to double that.[80] The [dynastic history of\nSui](/wiki/Book_of_Sui \"Book of Sui\") estimates that 500,000 people died\nbuilding the wall,[81] adding to the number of casualties caused by Emperor\nYang's projects including the aforementioned redesign of Luoyang, the [Grand\nCanal](/wiki/Grand_Canal_\\(China\\) \"Grand Canal \\(China\\)\"), and two ill-fated\n[campaigns against Goguryeo](/wiki/Goguryeo%E2%80%93Sui_War \"Goguryeo–Sui\nWar\"). With the economy strained and the populace resentful, the Sui dynasty\nerupted in rebellion and ended with the assassination of Emperor Yang in\n618.[82]\n\n## Tang dynasty\n(618–907)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Tang dynasty \\(618–907\\)\")]\n\n塞下曲 (望臨洮) **Under the Wall (Viewing Lintao)**\n\n    飲馬渡秋水 _My horse crosses the river in autumn,_\n    水寒風似刀 _The cold wind off the water cuts like a knife._\n    平沙日未沒 _Across the desert flats, the day is not yet finished,_\n    黯黯見臨洮 _I can dimly make out[Lintao](/wiki/Lintao \"Lintao\")._\n\n    昔日長城戰 _In olden days, battles along the Long Wall_\n    咸言意氣高 _Were described with praise and awe._\n    黃塵足今古 _But today, the past is no more than yellow dust_\n    白骨亂蓬蒿 _White bones jostled amongst the grass._\n\n—[Wang Changling](/wiki/Wang_Changling \"Wang Changling\") (698–755)[83]\n\nFrontier policy under the [Tang dynasty](/wiki/Tang_dynasty \"Tang dynasty\")\nreversed the wall-building activities of most previous dynasties that had\noccupied northern China since the third century BC, and no extensive wall\nbuilding took place for the next several hundred years.[84]\n\nSoon after the establishment of the Tang dynasty, during the reign of [Emperor\nTaizong](/wiki/Emperor_Taizong_of_Tang \"Emperor Taizong of Tang\") (r.\n626–649), the threat of Göktürk tribesmen from the north prompted some court\nofficials to suggest drafting [corvée](/wiki/Corv%C3%A9e \"Corvée\") labourers\nto repair the aging Great Wall. Taizong scoffed at the suggestion, alluding to\nthe Sui walls built in vain: \"The Emperor Yang of Sui made the people labor to\nconstruct the Great Wall in order to defend against the Turks, but in the end\nthis was of no use.\"[85] Instead of building walls, Taizong claimed he \"need\nmerely to establish [Li Shiji](/wiki/Li_Shiji \"Li Shiji\") in\n[Jinyang](/wiki/Taiyuan \"Taiyuan\") for the dust on the border to settle.\"[85]\nAccordingly, Taizong sent talented generals like Li Shiji with mobile armies\nto the frontier, while fortifications were mostly limited to a series of\nwalled garrisons, such as the euphemistically-named \"cities for accepting\nsurrender\" (受降城, _shòuxiáng chéng_) that were actually bases from which to\nlaunch attacks.[84] As a result of this military strategy, the Tang grew to\nbecome one of the largest of all the Chinese empires, destroying the Göktürks\nof the [Eastern Turkic Khaganate](/wiki/Eastern_Turkic_Khaganate \"Eastern\nTurkic Khaganate\") and acquiring territory stretching all the way to\n[Kazakhstan](/wiki/Kazakhstan \"Kazakhstan\").[85]\n\nNevertheless, records show that in the Kaiyuan [era](/wiki/Chinese_era_name\n\"Chinese era name\") (713–742) of [Emperor\nXuanzong](/wiki/Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Tang \"Emperor Xuanzong of Tang\")'s reign,\nthe general [Zhang Yue](/wiki/Zhang_Yue_\\(Tang_dynasty\\) \"Zhang Yue \\(Tang\ndynasty\\)\") built a wall 90 _li_ (48 kilometres (30 mi)) to the north of\nHuairong (懷戎; present-day [Huailai County](/wiki/Huailai_County \"Huailai\nCounty\"), Hebei), although it remains unclear whether he erected new walls or\nonly reinforced the existing Northern Qi walls.[86]\n\nThe Great Wall, or the ruins of it, features prominently in the subset of\n[Tang poetry](/wiki/Tang_poetry \"Tang poetry\") known as [_biansai\nshi_](/wiki/Classical_Chinese_poetry_genres#Frontier_Fortress_\\(邊塞,_出塞,_or_塞下曲\\)\n\"Classical Chinese poetry genres\") (邊塞詩, \"frontier verse\") written by scholar-\nofficials assigned along the frontier. Emphasizing the poets' loneliness and\nlonging for home while hinting at the pointlessness of their posts, these\nfrontier verses are characterized by imagery of desolate landscapes, including\nthe ruins of the now-neglected Great Wall—a direct product of Tang's frontier\npolicy.[87]\n\n## Northern Song\n(960-1127)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Northern Song \\(960-1127\\)\")]\n\nSee also: [History of the Song dynasty](/wiki/History_of_the_Song_dynasty\n\"History of the Song dynasty\")\n\nHan Chinese power during the tumultuous post-Tang era was represented by the\n[Song dynasty](/wiki/Song_dynasty \"Song dynasty\") (960–1279), which completed\nits unification of the Chinese states with the conquest of [Wuyue](/wiki/Wuyue\n\"Wuyue\") in 971. Turning to the north after this victory, in 979 the Song\neliminated the [Northern Han](/wiki/Northern_Han \"Northern Han\"), ultimate\nsuccessors to the Later Jin, but were unable to take the Sixteen Prefectures\nfrom the Liao dynasty.[88] As a result of Song's military aggression,\nrelations between the Song and Liao remained tense and hostile. One of the\nbattlegrounds in the [Song–Liao\nWar](/w/index.php?title=Song%E2%80%93Liao_War&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Song–Liao\nWar \\(page does not exist\\)\") was the Great Wall Gap (長城口), so named because\nthe southern Yan wall of the Warring States period crossed the Juma River here\ninto Liao territory.[28] The Great Wall Gap saw action in 979, 988–989, and\n1004, and a Song fortress was built there in 980.[89] Intermittent wars\nbetween the Song and the Liao lasted until January 1005, when a truce was\ncalled and led to the [Treaty of Chanyuan](/wiki/Treaty_of_Chanyuan \"Treaty of\nChanyuan\"). This agreement, among other things, required the Song to pay\ntribute to the Liao, recognized the Song and Liao as equals,[90] and\ndemarcated the Song–Liao border,[91] the course of which became more clearly\ndefined in a series of subsequent bilateral agreements. Several stretches of\nthe old Great Walls, including the Northern Qi Inner Wall near the [Hengshan\nmountain range](/wiki/Mount_Heng_\\(Shanxi\\) \"Mount Heng \\(Shanxi\\)\"), became\nthe border between the Song and the Liao.[92]\n\nIn the northwest, the Song were in conflict with the Western Xia, since they\noccupied what the Song considered as Chinese land lost during the Tang\ndynasty. The Song utilized the walls built during the reign of Qin's King\nZhaoxiang of the Warring States period, making it the Song–Western Xia\nborder,[93] but the topography of the area was not as sharp and distinct as\nthe Song–Liao defences to the east. The border general [Cao\nWei](/w/index.php?title=Cao_Wei_\\(Song_dynasty\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Cao\nWei \\(Song dynasty\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\") (曹瑋; 973–1030) deemed the Old\nWall itself insufficient to slow a Tangut cavalry attack, and had a deep\ntrench dug alongside.

Instead, when they could, the Mongols simply rode around the\nwalls; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211, when they circumvented\nthe substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon\nthe Jin armies at the [Battle of Yehuling](/wiki/Battle_of_Yehuling \"Battle of\nYehuling\").[110] The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment\nagainst the Jin; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls,\nsuch as those in [Gubeikou](/wiki/Gubeikou \"Gubeikou\"), often preferred to\nsurrender to the Mongols rather than fight them.[111] The only major\nengagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended\nJuyong Pass: instead of laying siege, the Mongol general [Jebe](/wiki/Jebe\n\"Jebe\") lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the\nopened gates.[111] In 1215, Genghis Khan besieged, captured, and sacked the\nJin capital of [Yanjing](/wiki/Yanjing \"Yanjing\") (modern-day Beijing). The\nJin dynasty eventually collapsed following the [siege of\nCaizhou](/wiki/Siege_of_Caizhou \"Siege of Caizhou\") in 1234.

Although he established garrisons along the steppe\nfrontier from the Juyan Lake Basin in the far west to\n[Yingchang](/wiki/Yingchang \"Yingchang\") in the east,[114] Khublai Khan and\nthe Yuan emperors after him did not add to the Great Wall (except for the\nornate [Cloud Platform](/wiki/Cloud_Platform_at_Juyongguan \"Cloud Platform at\nJuyongguan\") at Juyong Pass).

The Mongols fled back to\nMongolia, but even after numerous campaigns, the Mongol problem remained.[116]\n\nDuring his early reign, Hongwu set up the \"eight outer garrisons\" close to the\nsteppe and an inner line of forts more suitable for defence. The inner line\nwas the forerunner to the Ming Great Wall.[117] In 1373, as Ming forces\nencountered setbacks, Hongwu put more emphasis on defence and adopted [Hua\nYunlong](/w/index.php?title=Hua_Yunlong&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Hua Yunlong\n\\(page does not exist\\)\")'s (華雲龍) suggestion to establish garrisons at 130\npasses and other strategic points in the Beijing area.[118] More positions\nwere set up in the years up Hongwu's death in 1398, and watchtowers were\nmanned from the [Bohai Sea](/wiki/Bohai_Sea \"Bohai Sea\") to Beijing and\nfurther onto the Mongolian steppes.[118][119] These positions, however, were\nnot for a linear defence but rather a regional one in which walls did not\nfeature heavily, and offensive tactics remained the overarching policy at the\ntime.[118] In 1421, the Ming capital was relocated from\n[Nanjing](/wiki/Nanjing \"Nanjing\") in the south to Beijing in the north,\npartly to better manage the Mongol situation. Thus defenses were concentrated\naround Beijing, where stone and earth began to replace rammed earth in\nstrategic passes.[120] A wall was erected by the Ming in Liaodong to protect\nHan settlers from a possible threat from the Jurched-Mongol Oriyanghan around\n1442.[121] In 1467–68, expansion of the wall provided further protection for\nthe region from against attacks by the [Jianzhou\nJurchens](/wiki/Jianzhou_Jurchens \"Jianzhou Jurchens\") in the northeast.[122]\n\nMeanwhile, the outer defenses were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing\na vital foothold in the steppe transitional zone.[123] Despite the withdrawal\nfrom the steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position against the\nnomads until the [Tumu Crisis](/wiki/Tumu_Crisis \"Tumu Crisis\") in 1449, which\ncaused the collapse of the early Ming security system. Over half of the\ncampaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured\nthe [Zhengtong Emperor](/wiki/Zhengtong_Emperor \"Zhengtong Emperor\"). This\nmilitary debacle shattered the Chinese military might that had so impressed\nand given pause to the Mongols since the beginning of the dynasty, and caused\nthe Ming to be on the defensive ever after.[124]\n\nThe deterioration of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional\nzone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory, including the crucial\nOrdos region, on a level unprecedented since the dynasty's founding. After\ndecades of deliberation between an offensive strategy and an accommodative\npolicy, the decision to build the first major Ming walls in the Ordos was\nagreed upon as an acceptable compromise the 1470s.[125]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Jinshangling2.jpg/220px-\nJinshangling2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jinshangling2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jinshangling2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA section of the Great Wall at [Jinshanling](/wiki/Jinshanling \"Jinshanling\")\nin [Luanping County](/wiki/Luanping_County \"Luanping County\"),\n[Hebei](/wiki/Hebei \"Hebei\") province, China\n\n[Yu Zijun](/w/index.php?title=Yu_Zijun&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Yu Zijun \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") (余子俊; 1429–1489) first proposed constructing a wall in the\nOrdos region in August 1471,[126] but not until 20 December 1472 did the court\nand emperor approve the plan.

This wall, a\ncombined effort between Yu Zijun and Wang Yue, stretched from present day\nHengcheng (橫城) in [Lingwu](/wiki/Lingwu \"Lingwu\") (northwestern\n[Ningxia](/wiki/Ningxia \"Ningxia\") province) to Huamachi town (花馬池鎮) in\n[Yanchi County](/wiki/Yanchi_County \"Yanchi County\"), and from there to\nQingshuiying (清水營) in northeastern Shaanxi, a total of more than 2000 _li_\n(about 1,100 kilometres (680 mi)) long. Along its length were 800 strong\npoints, sentry posts, beacon-fire towers, and assorted defences. 40,000 men\nwere enlisted for this effort, which was completed in several months at a cost\nof over one million silver [taels](/wiki/Tael \"Tael\"). This defence system\nproved its initial worth in 1482, when a large group of Mongol raiders were\ntrapped within the double lines of fortifications and suffered a defeat by the\nMing generals. This was seen as a vindication of Yu Zijun's strategy of wall-\nbuilding by the people of the border areas.[127] By the mid-16th century, Yu's\nwall in the Ordos had seen expansion into an extensive defence system. It\ncontained two defence lines: Yu's wall, called the \"great border\" (大邊,\n_dàbiān_), and a \"secondary border\" (二邊, _èrbiān_) built by [Yang\nYiqing](/w/index.php?title=Yang_Yiqing&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Yang Yiqing\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") (楊一清; 1454–1530) behind it.[128]\n\nFollowing the success of the Ordos walls, Yu Zijun proposed construction of a\nfurther wall that would extend from the Yellow River bend in the Ordos to the\nSihaiye Pass (四海冶口; in present-day [Yanqing County](/wiki/Yanqing_County\n\"Yanqing County\")) near the capital Beijing, running a distance of more than\n1300 _li_ (about 700 kilometres (430 mi)).[129] The project received approval\nin 1485, but Yu's political enemies harped on the cost overruns and forced Yu\nto scrap the project and retire the same year. For more than 50 years after\nYu's resignation, political struggle prevented major wall constructions on a\nscale comparable to Yu's Ordos project.[130]\n\nHowever, wall construction continued regardless of court politics during this\ntime. The Ordos walls underwent extension, elaboration, and repair well into\nthe 16th century.[128] Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the\nwall building material, because they offered better protection and durability.\nThis change in material gave rise to a number of necessary accommodations with\nregard to logistics, and inevitably a drastic increase in costs. Instead of\nbeing able to draw on local resources, building projects now required brick-\nkilns, quarries, and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the work site.\nAlso, masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for\nthe level of sophistication that brick constructions required. Work that\noriginally could be done by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men\nto do in stone.[131]\n\n### The Walls of Xuanfu–Datong and the western\nreaches[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: The Walls of Xuanfu–Datong and the western reaches\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Dajingmen_03_July_2%2C2010.jpg/220px-\nDajingmen_03_July_2%2C2010.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dajingmen_03_July_2,2010.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dajingmen_03_July_2,2010.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Great Wall at [Dajingmen](/wiki/Dajingmen \"Dajingmen\"), part of the Xuanfu\nstretch of the Great Wall.

At its height, the Xuan–Da portion of the Great\nWall totalled about 850 kilometres (530 miles) of wall, with some sections\nbeing doubled-up with two lines of wall, some tripled or even quadrupled. The\nouter frontier was now protected by a wall called the \"outer border\" (外邊,\n_wàibiān_) that extended 380 kilometres (240 mi) from the Yellow River's edge\nat the Piantou Pass (偏頭關) along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into\nHebei province; the \"inner border\" wall (內邊, _nèibiān_) ran southeast from\nPiantou Pass for some 400 kilometres (250 mi), ending at the [Pingxing\nPass](/wiki/Pingxing_Pass \"Pingxing Pass\"); a \"river wall\" (河邊, _hébiān_) also\nran from the Piantou Pass and followed the Yellow River southwards for about\n70 kilometres (43 mi).[135]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Overhanging_Wall.JPG/220px-\nOverhanging_Wall.JPG)](/wiki/File:Overhanging_Wall.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Overhanging_Wall.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA section of the Great Wall on the Hanging Cliffs (懸壁長城) leading up to [Jiayu\nPass](/wiki/Jiayu_Pass \"Jiayu Pass\")\n\nAs with Yu Zijun's wall in the Ordos, the Mongols shifted their attacks away\nfrom the newly strengthened Xuan–Da sector to less well-protected areas.

However, despite several attempts,\nhe could not take Xuanfu due to Weng Wanda's double fortified line while the\ngarrison at Datong bribed him to not attack there.[133] Instead of continuing\nto operate in the area, he circled around Weng Wanda's wall to the relatively\nlightly defended [Gubeikou](/wiki/Gubeikou \"Gubeikou\"), northeast of Beijing.\nFrom there Altan Khan passed through the defences and raided the suburbs of\nBeijing. According to one contemporary source, the raid took more than 60,000\nlives and an additional 40,000 people became prisoners. As a response to this\nraid, the focus of the Ming's northern defences shifted from the Xuan–Da\nregion to the Jizhou (薊州鎮) and Changping Defence Commands (昌平鎮) where the\nbreach took place.[137] Later in the same year, the dry-stone walls of the\nJizhou–Changping area (abbreviated as \"Ji–Chang\") were replaced by stone and\nmortar. These allowed the Chinese to build on steeper, more easily defended\nslopes and facilitated construction of features such as\n[ramparts](/wiki/Defensive_wall \"Defensive wall\"),\n[crenelations](/wiki/Battlement \"Battlement\"), and [peepholes](/wiki/Peephole\n\"Peephole\").[138] The effectiveness of the new walls was demonstrated in the\nfailed Mongol raid of 1554, where raiders expecting a repeat of the events of\n1550 were surprised by the higher wall and stiff Chinese resistance.[139]\n\nIn 1567 [Qi Jiguang](/wiki/Qi_Jiguang \"Qi Jiguang\") and [Tan\nLun](/wiki/Tan_Lun \"Tan Lun\"), successful generals who fended off the [coastal\npirates](/wiki/Jiajing_wokou_raids \"Jiajing wokou raids\"), were reassigned to\nmanage the Ji–Chang Defense Commands and step up the defences of the capital\nregion. Under their ambitious and energetic management, 1200 brick watchtowers\nwere built along the Great Wall from 1569 to 1571.[140] These included the\nfirst large-scale use of hollow watchtowers on the Wall: up until this point,\nmost previous towers along the Great Wall had been solid, with a small hut on\ntop for a sentry to take shelter from the elements and Mongol arrows; the\nJi–Chang towers built from 1569 onwards were hollow brick structures, allowing\nsoldiers interior space to live, store food and water, stockpile weapons, and\ntake shelter from Mongol arrows.[141]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Shanhaiguan.gif/220px-\nShanhaiguan.gif)](/wiki/File:Shanhaiguan.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Shanhaiguan.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nIllustration of the Shanhai Pass garrison at the time of the Manchu conquests\n\nAltan Khan eventually made peace with China when it opened border cities for\ntrade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and\nTan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along\nthe border. However, minor raids still happened from time to time when the\nprofits of plunder outweighed those of trade,[137] prompting the Ming to close\nall gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once\nconsidered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas\nof a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists\nstill see today.[142]\n\nWall construction continued until the demise of the Ming dynasty in 1644.[143]\nIn the decades that led to the [fall of the Ming\ndynasty](/wiki/Fall_of_the_Ming_dynasty \"Fall of the Ming dynasty\"), the Ming\ncourt and the Great Wall itself had to deal with simultaneous internal\nrebellions and the [Manchu invasions](/wiki/Manchu_conquest_of_China \"Manchu\nconquest of China\"). In addition to their conquest of Liaodong, the Manchus\nhad raided across the Great Wall for the first time [in\n1629](/wiki/Jisi_Incident \"Jisi Incident\"),[144] and again in 1634,[145]\n1638,[146] and 1642.[147] Meanwhile, the rebels led by warlord [Li\nZicheng](/wiki/Li_Zicheng \"Li Zicheng\") had been gathering strength. In the\nearly months of 1644, Li Zicheng declared himself the founder of the\n[Shun](/wiki/Shun_dynasty \"Shun dynasty\") and marched towards the Ming capital\nfrom Shaanxi. His route roughly followed the line of the Great Wall, in order\nto neutralize its heavily fortified garrisons.[148] The crucial defences of\nDatong, Xuanfu, and Juyong Pass all surrendered without a fight, and the\n[Chongzhen Emperor](/wiki/Chongzhen_Emperor \"Chongzhen Emperor\") hanged\nhimself on 25 April as the Shun army entered Beijing.[149] At this point, the\nlargest remaining Ming fighting force in North China was in Shanhai Pass,\nwhere the Great Wall meets the Bohai Sea. Its defender [Wu\nSangui](/wiki/Wu_Sangui \"Wu Sangui\"), wedged between the Shun army within and\nthe Manchus without, decided to surrender to the Manchus and opened the gates\nfor them.[150] The Manchus, having thus entered through the Great Wall,\ndefeated Li Zicheng at the [Battle of Shanhai\nPass](/wiki/Battle_of_Shanhai_Pass \"Battle of Shanhai Pass\") and seized\nBeijing on June 5\\. They eventually defeated both the rebel-founded Shun\ndynasty and the [remaining Ming resistance](/wiki/Southern_Ming \"Southern\nMing\"), establishing their rule over all of China as the Qing dynasty.[151]\n\nOpinions about the Wall's role in the Ming dynasty's downfall are mixed.\nHistorians such as [Arthur Waldron](/wiki/Arthur_Waldron \"Arthur Waldron\") and\n[Julia Lovell](/wiki/Julia_Lovell \"Julia Lovell\") are critical of the whole\nwall-building exercise in light of its ultimate failure in protecting China;\nthe former compared the Great Wall with the failed [Maginot\nLine](/wiki/Maginot_Line \"Maginot Line\") of the French in [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\").[152] However, independent scholar\n[David Spindler](/wiki/David_Spindler \"David Spindler\") notes that the Wall,\nbeing only part of a complex foreign policy, received \"disproportionate blame\"\nbecause it was the most obvious relic of that policy.[153]\n\n## Qing dynasty\n(1644–1911)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Qing dynasty \\(1644–1911\\)\")]\n\nThe usefulness of the Great Wall as a defence line against northern nomads\nbecame questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed\nvast areas inside and outside the wall: China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia\nwere all under Qing control. So instead, the Great Wall became the means to\nlimit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria,\nconsidered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts\nof the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han\nChinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected [Willow\nPalisade](/wiki/Willow_Palisade \"Willow Palisade\").[154]\n\nCulturally, the wall's symbolic role as a line between civilized society and\nbarbarism was suppressed by the Qing, who were keen to weaken the Han\nculturalism that had been propagated by the Ming. As a result, no special\nattention was paid to the Great Wall until the mid-Qing dynasty, when\nWesterners started to show interest in the structure.[155]\n\n### Western appreciation of the\nWall[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Western appreciation of the Wall\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Kircher_-\n_China_Illustrata_-_217_-_Great_Wall.jpg/220px-Kircher_-\n_China_Illustrata_-_217_-_Great_Wall.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kircher_-\n_China_Illustrata_-_217_-_Great_Wall.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kircher_-_China_Illustrata_-_217_-_Great_Wall.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"A gate of the Wall of China, explaining its structure\".

The [late\nantiquity](/wiki/Late_antiquity \"Late antiquity\") historian [Ammianus\nMarcellinus](/wiki/Ammianus_Marcellinus \"Ammianus Marcellinus\") (330?–395?)\nmentioned \"summits of lofty walls\" enclosing the land of [Seres](/wiki/Seres\n\"Seres\"), the country that the Romans believed to be at the eastern end of the\n[Silk Road](/wiki/Silk_Road \"Silk Road\").[156] In legend, the tribes of [Gog\nand Magog](/wiki/Gog_and_Magog \"Gog and Magog\") were said to have been locked\nout by [Alexander the Great](/wiki/Alexander_the_Great \"Alexander the Great\")\nwith [walls of steel](/wiki/Gates_of_Alexander \"Gates of Alexander\"). Later\nArab writers and travellers, such as [Rashid-al-Din Hamadani](/wiki/Rashid-al-\nDin_Hamadani \"Rashid-al-Din Hamadani\") (1248–1318) and [Ibn\nBattuta](/wiki/Ibn_Battuta \"Ibn Battuta\") (1304–1377), would erroneously\nidentify the Great Wall in China with the walls of the [Alexander\nromances](/wiki/Alexander_romances \"Alexander romances\").[157] Soon after\nEuropeans reached Ming China in the early 16th century, accounts of the Great\nWall started to circulate in Europe, even though no European would see it with\ntheir own eyes for another century. The work _A Treatise of China and the\nAdjoyning Regions_ by [Gaspar da Cruz](/wiki/Gaspar_da_Cruz \"Gaspar da Cruz\")\n(c. 1520–70) offered an early discussion of the Great Wall in which he noted,\n\"a Wall of an hundred [leagues](/wiki/League_\\(unit\\) \"League \\(unit\\)\") in\nlength. And some will affirme to bee more than a hundred leagues.\"[158]\nAnother early account written by Bishop [Juan González de\nMendoza](/wiki/Juan_Gonz%C3%A1lez_de_Mendoza \"Juan González de Mendoza\")\n(1550–1620) reported a wall five hundred leagues long, but suggested that only\none hundred leagues were man-made, with the rest natural rock formations.[158]\nThe [Jesuit](/wiki/Jesuit \"Jesuit\") priest [Matteo Ricci](/wiki/Matteo_Ricci\n\"Matteo Ricci\") (1552–1610) mentioned the Great Wall once in his diary, noting\nthe existence of \"a tremendous wall four hundred and five miles long\" that\nformed part of the northern defences of the Ming Empire.[158]\n\nEuropeans first witnessed the Great Wall in the early 1600s. Perhaps the first\nrecorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall\ncame in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother [Bento de\nGóis](/wiki/Bento_de_G%C3%B3is \"Bento de Góis\") reached the northwestern\n[Jiayu Pass](/wiki/Jiayu_Pass \"Jiayu Pass\") from India.[159] [Ivan\nPetlin](/wiki/Ivan_Petlin \"Ivan Petlin\")'s 1619 deposition for his Russian\nembassy mission offers an early account based on a first-hand encounter with\nthe Great Wall, and mentions that in the course of the journey his embassy\ntravelled alongside the Great Wall for ten days.[160]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Allom_-\n_The_Great_Wall_of_China.jpg/250px-Allom_-\n_The_Great_Wall_of_China.jpg)](/wiki/File:Allom_-_The_Great_Wall_of_China.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Allom_-_The_Great_Wall_of_China.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Great Wall as depicted in [Thomas Allom](/wiki/Thomas_Allom \"Thomas\nAllom\")'s 1845 _China, in a series of views_\n\nEarly European accounts were mostly modest and empirical, closely mirroring\ncontemporary Chinese understanding of the Wall.[161] However, when the Ming\nGreat Wall began to take on a shape recognizable today, foreign accounts of\nthe Wall slid into hyperbole.[162] In the _[Atlas\nSinensis](/w/index.php?title=Atlas_Sinensis&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Atlas\nSinensis \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ published in 1665, the Jesuit [Martino\nMartini](/wiki/Martino_Martini \"Martino Martini\") described elaborate but\natypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications\nacross the whole northern frontier. Furthermore, Martini erroneously\nidentified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd\ncentury BC, thereby exaggerating both the Wall's antiquity and its size. This\nmisconception was compounded by the _[China Illustrata](/wiki/China_Illustrata\n\"China Illustrata\")_ of Father [Athanasius Kircher](/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher\n\"Athanasius Kircher\") (1602–80), which provided pictures of the Great Wall as\nimagined by a European illustrator.[162] All these and other accounts from\nmissionaries in China contributed to the [Orientalism](/wiki/Orientalism\n\"Orientalism\") of the eighteenth century, in which a mythical China and its\nexaggerated Great Wall feature prominently. The French philosopher\n[Voltaire](/wiki/Voltaire \"Voltaire\") (1694–1774), for example, frequently\nwrote about the Great Wall, although his feelings towards it oscillate between\nunreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a \"monument to fear\".[163] The\n[Macartney Embassy](/wiki/Macartney_Embassy \"Macartney Embassy\") of 1793\npassed through the Great Wall at [Gubeikou](/wiki/Gubeikou \"Gubeikou\") on the\nway to see the [Qianlong Emperor](/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor \"Qianlong Emperor\")\nin [Chengde](/wiki/Chengde \"Chengde\"), who was there for the annual [imperial\nhunt](/wiki/Imperial_hunt_of_the_Qing_dynasty \"Imperial hunt of the Qing\ndynasty\"). One of the embassy's members, [John\nBarrow](/wiki/Sir_John_Barrow,_1st_Baronet \"Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet\"),\nlater founder of the [Royal Geographical\nSociety](/wiki/Royal_Geographical_Society \"Royal Geographical Society\"),\nspuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to\n\"all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland\" and would suffice to\nencircle the Earth at the equator twice.[164] The illustrations of the Great\nWall by Lieutenant Henry William Parish during this mission would be\nreproduced in influential works such as [Thomas Allom](/wiki/Thomas_Allom\n\"Thomas Allom\")'s 1845 _China, in a series of views_.[165]\n\nExposure to such works brought many foreign visitors to the Great Wall after\nChina opened its borders as a result of the nation's defeat in the [Opium\nWars](/wiki/Opium_Wars \"Opium Wars\") of the mid-19th century at the hands of\nBritain and the other Western powers. The Juyong Pass near Beijing and the\n\"Old Dragon Head,\" where the Great Wall meets the sea at the [Shanhai\nPass](/wiki/Shanhai_Pass \"Shanhai Pass\"), proved popular destinations for\nthese wall watchers.[165]\n\nThe travelogues of the later 19th century in turn further contributed to the\nelaboration and propagation of the Great Wall myth.[165] Examples of this\nmyth's growth are the false but widespread belief that the Great Wall of China\nis visible from the Moon[166][167] or Mars.[168]\n\n## Modern China\n(1911–present)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Modern China \\(1911–present\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Greatwall_large.jpg/220px-\nGreatwall_large.jpg)](/wiki/File:Greatwall_large.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Greatwall_large.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Great Wall in 1907\n\nThe [Xinhai Revolution](/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution \"Xinhai Revolution\") in 1911\nforced the abdication of the last Qing Emperor [Puyi](/wiki/Puyi \"Puyi\") and\nended China's last imperial dynasty. The revolutionaries, headed by [Sun Yat-\nsen](/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen \"Sun Yat-sen\"), were concerned with creating a modern\nsense of national identity in the chaotic post-imperial era. In contrast to\nChinese academics such as [Liang Qichao](/wiki/Liang_Qichao \"Liang Qichao\"),\nwho tried to counter the West's fantastic version of the Great Wall,[168] Sun\nYat-sen held the view that Qin Shi Huang's wall preserved the Chinese race,\nand without it Chinese culture would not have developed enough to expand to\nthe south and assimilate foreign conquerors. Such an endorsement from the\n\"Father of Modern China\" started to transform the Great Wall into a national\nsymbol in the Chinese consciousness, though this transformation was hampered\nby conflicting views of nationalism with regard to the nascent \"new\nChina.\"[169]\n\nThe failure of the new [Republic of\nChina](/wiki/Republic_of_China_\\(1912%E2%80%9349\\) \"Republic of China\n\\(1912–49\\)\") fanned disillusionment with traditional Chinese culture and\nushered in the [New Culture Movement](/wiki/New_Culture_Movement \"New Culture\nMovement\") and the [May Fourth Movement](/wiki/May_Fourth_Movement \"May Fourth\nMovement\") of the mid-1910s and 1920s that aimed to dislodge China's future\ntrajectory from its past. Naturally, the Great Wall of China came under attack\nas a symbol of the past. For example, an influential writer of this period,\n[Lu Xun](/wiki/Lu_Xun \"Lu Xun\"), harshly criticized the \"mighty and accursed\nGreat Wall\"[169] in a short essay: \"In reality, it has never served any\npurpose than to make countless workers labour to death in vain ... [It]\nsurrounds everyone.\"[170]\n\nArise! All those who don't want to be slaves!  \nLet our flesh and blood forge our new Great Wall!\n\n\"[The March of the Volunteers](/wiki/The_March_of_the_Volunteers \"The March of\nthe Volunteers\")\"\n\nThe [Sino-Japanese conflict](/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War \"Second Sino-\nJapanese War\") (1931–45) gave the Great Wall a new lease of life in the eyes\nof the Chinese. During the 1933 [defence of the Great\nWall](/wiki/Defence_of_the_Great_Wall \"Defence of the Great Wall\"),\ninadequately-equipped Chinese soldiers held off double their number of\nJapanese troops for several months. Using the cover of the Great Wall, the\nChinese – who were at times only armed with broadswords – were able to beat\noff a Japanese advance that had the support of aerial bombardment.[171] With\nthe Chinese forces eventually overrun, the subsequent [Tanggu\nTruce](/wiki/Tanggu_Truce \"Tanggu Truce\") stipulated that the Great Wall was\nto become a demilitarized zone separating China and the newly created Japanese\n[puppet state](/wiki/Puppet_state \"Puppet state\") of\n[Manchukuo](/wiki/Manchukuo \"Manchukuo\"). Even so, the determined defence of\nthe Great Wall made it a symbol of Chinese patriotism and the resoluteness of\nthe Chinese people.[172] The [Chinese Communist](/wiki/Chinese_Communist\n\"Chinese Communist\") leader [Mao Zedong](/wiki/Mao_Zedong \"Mao Zedong\") picked\nup this symbol in [his poetry](/wiki/Poetry_of_Mao_Zedong \"Poetry of Mao\nZedong\") during his \"[Long March](/wiki/Long_March \"Long March\")\" escaping\nfrom [Kuomintang](/wiki/Kuomintang \"Kuomintang\") prosecution. Near the end of\nthe trek in 1935, Mao wrote the poem \"Mount Liupan\" that contains the well-\nknown line that would be carved in stone along the Great Wall in the present\nday: \"Those who fail to reach the Great Wall are not true men\" (不到长城非好汉).[173]\nAnother noteworthy reference to the Great Wall is in the song \"[The March of\nthe Volunteers](/wiki/The_March_of_the_Volunteers \"The March of the\nVolunteers\")\", whose words came from a stanza in [Tian Han](/wiki/Tian_Han\n\"Tian Han\")'s 1934 poem entitled \"The Great Wall\".[174] The song, originally\nfrom the anti-Japanese movie _[Children of Troubled\nTimes](/wiki/Children_of_Troubled_Times \"Children of Troubled Times\")_ ,\nenjoyed continued popularity in China and was selected as the provisional\n[national anthem](/wiki/National_anthem \"National anthem\") of the [People's\nRepublic of China](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China \"People's Republic of\nChina\") (PRC) at its establishment in 1949.[175][176]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/President_Richard_and_Pat_Nixon_on_Great_Wall.png/220px-\nPresident_Richard_and_Pat_Nixon_on_Great_Wall.png)](/wiki/File:President_Richard_and_Pat_Nixon_on_Great_Wall.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:President_Richard_and_Pat_Nixon_on_Great_Wall.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[US President Nixon](/wiki/1972_Nixon_visit_to_China \"1972 Nixon visit to\nChina\") visits the Great Wall, 1972\n\nIn 1952, the scholar-turned-bureaucrat [Guo Moruo](/wiki/Guo_Moruo \"Guo\nMoruo\") laid out the first modern proposal to repair the Great Wall. Five\nyears later, the renovated [Badaling](/wiki/Badaling \"Badaling\") became the\nfirst section to be opened to the public since the establishment of the\nPRC.[177] The Badaling Great Wall has since become a staple stop for foreign\ndignitaries who come to China, beginning with Nepali prime minister\n[Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala](/wiki/Bishweshwar_Prasad_Koirala \"Bishweshwar\nPrasad Koirala\") in 1960,[178] and most notably the American president\n[Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\") in his historic [1972\nvisit to China](/wiki/1972_Nixon_visit_to_China \"1972 Nixon visit to\nChina\").[179] To date, Badaling is still the most visited stretch of the Great\nWall.[180]\n\nOther stretches did not fare so well. During the [Cultural\nRevolution](/wiki/Cultural_Revolution \"Cultural Revolution\") (1966–76),\nhundreds of kilometres of the Great Wall—already damaged in the wars of the\nlast century and eroded by wind and rain—were deliberately destroyed by\nfervent [Red Guards](/wiki/Red_Guards_\\(China\\) \"Red Guards \\(China\\)\") who\nregarded it as part of the \"[Four Olds](/wiki/Four_Olds \"Four Olds\")\" to be\neradicated in the new China. Quarrying machines and even dynamite were used to\ndismantle the Wall, and the pilfered materials were used for construction.[3]\n\nAs China [opened up in the 1980s](/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform \"Chinese\neconomic reform\"), reformist leader [Deng Xiaoping](/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping \"Deng\nXiaoping\") initiated the \"Love our China and restore our Great Wall\" campaign\n(爱我中华，修我长城) to repair and preserve the Great Wall.[181] The Great Wall was\ndesignated as a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](/wiki/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site\n\"UNESCO World Heritage Site\") in 1987.[5] However, while tourism boomed over\nthe years, slipshod restoration methods have left sections of the Great Wall\nnear Beijing \"looking like a Hollywood set\" in the words of the _[National\nGeographic News](/wiki/National_Geographic_News \"National Geographic\nNews\")_.[182] The less prominent stretches of the Great Wall did not get as\nmuch attention. In 2002 the New York-based [World Monuments\nFund](/wiki/World_Monuments_Fund \"World Monuments Fund\") put the Great Wall on\nits list of the [World's 100 Most Endangered\nSites](/wiki/2002_World_Monuments_Watch \"2002 World Monuments Watch\"). In 2003\nthe Chinese government began to enact laws to protect the Great Wall.[182]\n\n##\nHistoriography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Historiography\")]\n\nSee also: [Chinese historiography](/wiki/Chinese_historiography \"Chinese\nhistoriography\") and [Sinology](/wiki/Sinology \"Sinology\")\n\nIn China, one of the first individuals to attempt a multi-dynastic history of\nthe Great Wall was the 17th-century scholar [Gu Yanwu](/wiki/Gu_Yanwu \"Gu\nYanwu\"). More recently, in the 1930s and 1940s, Wang Guoliang (王國良) and Shou\nPengfei (壽鵬飛) produced exhaustive studies that culled extant literary records\nto date and mapped the courses of early border walls. However, these efforts\nwere based solely on written records that contain obscure place names and\nelusive literary references.[183]\n\nThe rise of modern archeology has contributed much to the study of the Great\nWall, either in corroborating existing research or in refuting it. However\nthese efforts do not yet give a full picture of the Great Wall's history, as\nmany wall sites dating to the [Period of Disunity](/wiki/Period_of_Disunity\n\"Period of Disunity\") (220–589) had been overlaid by the extant Ming Great\nWall.[183]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Chinesische_Mauer_%28Ortelius_1584%29.jpg/220px-\nChinesische_Mauer_%28Ortelius_1584%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chinesische_Mauer_\\(Ortelius_1584\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chinesische_Mauer_\\(Ortelius_1584\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe first map of China printed in a European atlas, engraved by [Abraham\nOrtelius](/wiki/Abraham_Ortelius \"Abraham Ortelius\") (1584), shows a series of\nwalls wedged between mountains against the Tartars, represented by\n[yurts](/wiki/Yurt \"Yurt\").\n\nWestern scholarship of the Great Wall was, until recently, affected by\nmisconceptions derived from traditional accounts of the Wall. When the Jesuits\nbrought back the first reports of the Wall to the West, European scholars were\npuzzled that Marco Polo had not mentioned the presumably perennial \"Great\nWall\" in his _[Travels](/wiki/Travels_of_Marco_Polo \"Travels of Marco Polo\")_.\nSome 17th-century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the\nMing dynasty, after Marco Polo's departure. This view was soon replaced by\nanother that argued, against Polo's own account, that the Venetian merchant\nhad come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the\nWall.[115] Thus, Father [Martino Martini](/wiki/Martino_Martini \"Martino\nMartini\")'s mistaken claim that the Wall had \"lasted right up to the present\ntime without injury or destruction\"[184] since the time of Qin was accepted as\nfact by the 18th-century _[philosophes](/wiki/Philosophes\n\"Philosophes\")_.[185]\n\nSince then, many scholars have operated under the belief that the Great Wall\ncontinually defended China's border against the steppe nomads for two thousand\nyears.[186] For example, the 18th-century sinologist [Joseph de\nGuignes](/wiki/Joseph_de_Guignes \"Joseph de Guignes\") assigned\n[macrohistorical](/wiki/Macrohistorical \"Macrohistorical\") importance to such\nwalls when he advanced the theory that the Qin construction forced the Xiongnu\nto migrate west to Europe and, becoming known as the [Huns](/wiki/Huns\n\"Huns\"), ultimately contributed to the [decline of the Roman\nEmpire](/wiki/Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire \"Decline of the Roman Empire\").[187]\nSome have attempted to make general statements regarding Chinese society and\nforeign policy based on the conception of a perennial Great Wall: [Karl\nMarx](/wiki/Karl_Marx \"Karl Marx\") took the Wall to represent the stagnation\nof the Chinese society and economy,[188] [Owen Lattimore](/wiki/Owen_Lattimore\n\"Owen Lattimore\") supposed that the Great Wall demonstrated a need to divide\nthe nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China,[189] and\n[John K.

[Joseph\nNeedham](/wiki/Joseph_Needham \"Joseph Needham\") bemoaned this dearth when he\nwas compiling the section on walls for his _[Science and Civilisation in\nChina](/wiki/Science_and_Civilisation_in_China \"Science and Civilisation in\nChina\")_ : \"There is no lack of travelers' description of the Great Wall, but\nstudies based on modern scholarship are few and far between, whether in\nChinese or Western languages.\"[191] In 1990, [Arthur\nWaldron](/wiki/Arthur_Waldron \"Arthur Waldron\") published the influential _The\nGreat Wall: From History to Myth_ , where he challenged the notion of a\nunitary Great Wall maintained since antiquity, dismissing it as a modern myth.\nWaldron's approach prompted a re-examination of the Wall in Western\nscholarship.[192] Still, as of 2008, there is not yet a full authoritative\ntext in any language that is devoted to the Great Wall.[193] The reason for\nthis, according to _[The New Yorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker \"The New Yorker\")_\njournalist [Peter Hessler](/wiki/Peter_Hessler \"Peter Hessler\"), is that the\nGreat Wall fits into neither the study of political institutions (favoured by\nChinese historians) nor the excavation of tombs (favoured by Chinese\narcheologists).[194] Some of the void left by academia is being filled by\nindependent research from Great Wall enthusiasts such as\nex-[Xinhua](/wiki/Xinhua \"Xinhua\") reporter Cheng Dalin (成大林) and self-funded\nscholar [David Spindler](/wiki/David_Spindler \"David Spindler\").[195]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [History of China](/wiki/History_of_China \"History of China\")\n  * [History of Central Asia](/wiki/History_of_Central_Asia \"History of Central Asia\")\n  * [Military history of China before 1911](/wiki/Military_history_of_China_before_1911 \"Military history of China before 1911\")\n  * [Foreign relations of Imperial China](/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Imperial_China \"Foreign relations of Imperial China\")\n  * _[Lady Meng Jiang](/wiki/Lady_Meng_Jiang \"Lady Meng Jiang\")_ , a Chinese folk tale about the Great Wall\n  * [Battle of Shanhaiguan (1900)](/wiki/Battle_of_Shanhaiguan_\\(1900\\) \"Battle of Shanhaiguan \\(1900\\)\"), British forces occupy and damage parts of Shanhai Pass during the [Boxer Rebellion](/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion \"Boxer Rebellion\")\n  * [_The Great Wall of China_](/wiki/The_Great_Wall_of_China_\\(Kafka\\) \"The Great Wall of China \\(Kafka\\)\"), a short story by [Franz Kafka](/wiki/Franz_Kafka \"Franz Kafka\")\n  * [Great Wall of China hoax](/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China_hoax \"Great Wall of China hoax\"), published in 1899 and expanded in 1939\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Great_Wall_of_China&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Great Wall of China even longer than previously thought: Survey measures the wall at 21,196 km long\"](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/great-wall-of-china-even-longer-than-previously-thought-1.1263111).
