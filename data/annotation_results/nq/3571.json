Camera crews were given access\nto the accused's extended family, the defense attorneys, and the courtroom.[3]\nThe film features a brief appearance by [Mike Nifong](/wiki/Mike_Nifong \"Mike\nNifong\"), a future figure in the [Duke lacrosse case](/wiki/Duke_lacrosse_case\n\"Duke lacrosse case\"), working with the team prosecuting Peterson.\n\nAn abbreviated version was broadcast as special two-hour presentation of\nAmerican news show _[Primetime Thursday](/wiki/Primetime_\\(U.S._TV_program\\)\n\"Primetime \\(U.S. TV program\\)\")_ on July 22, 2004.[4] The miniseries was\ncompleted in September 2004,[5] and premiered in October on\n[Canal+](/wiki/Canal%2B \"Canal+\"),[6] from January 10–14, 2005, on BBC Four\n(as part of its _[Storyville](/wiki/Storyville_\\(TV_series\\) \"Storyville \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ documentary series),[7] and from April 4–25 on Sundance\nChannel.[8][9]\n\nThe BBC featured an interview with Lestrade in 2005.[10]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Reception\n  * 3 Sequels\n  * 4 Legacy\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Plot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Staircase&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Plot\")]\n\nIn December 2001, novelist Michael Peterson called to report that his wife\nKathleen had fallen down a set of stairs in their [Forest\nHills](/wiki/Forest_Hills_Historic_District_\\(Durham,_North_Carolina\\) \"Forest\nHills Historic District \\(Durham, North Carolina\\)\") mansion and died. The\nauthorities disbelieved Peterson's story that Kathleen had fallen while drunk\nand concluded instead that he had bludgeoned her to death, most likely with a\nfireplace poker which was discovered missing from the house. Peterson was soon\ncharged with murder. The film details the ensuing case from the point of view\nof Peterson and his defense team, led by David Rudolf. During the trial it is\ndiscovered that while Peterson was living in Germany, a family friend died\nfrom an [intra-cerebral haemorrhage](/wiki/Stroke \"Stroke\"), followed by the\nbody falling down stairs after collapsing, which resulted in similar head\ninjuries to those sustained by Peterson's wife. An investigation by German\npolice and US military authorities concluded that the death was accidental,\nand Peterson ended up adopting the woman's two daughters. The prosecution\nintroduce this death into the trial as an incident giving Peterson the idea of\nhow to \"fake\" Kathleen's accident. During the trial, Peterson's daughters\nstand steadfastly by their father. The prosecution argues that Kathleen had\ndiscovered that Michael was bisexual and had been having affairs with men,\nwhich led to an argument in which he bludgeoned her to death. Peterson claimed\nthat his wife knew about his sexuality and that they had an [open\nmarriage](/wiki/Open_marriage \"Open marriage\"). He claims to have been outside\nby their pool when Kathleen fell down the stairs and injured herself. A\ndefense team recreation shows that it would have been possible for Peterson to\nhave missed his wife's cries for help had he been by the pool. The jury\nultimately convicts Peterson.\n\n## Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Staircase&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nReviews for _The Staircase_ were generally positive.
