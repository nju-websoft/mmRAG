It is the third feature-length live-\naction/animation hybrid film to feature _[Looney Tunes](/wiki/Looney_Tunes\n\"Looney Tunes\")_ characters, after _[Who Framed Roger\nRabbit](/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\")_ (1988) and\n_[Space Jam](/wiki/Space_Jam \"Space Jam\")_ (1996). The plot follows [Daffy\nDuck](/wiki/Daffy_Duck \"Daffy Duck\") and [Bugs Bunny](/wiki/Bugs_Bunny \"Bugs\nBunny\") (both voiced by [Joe Alaskey](/wiki/Joe_Alaskey \"Joe Alaskey\")) as\nthey help aspiring [daredevil](/wiki/Stunt_performer \"Stunt performer\") Damian\n\"D.J.\" Drake, Jr. ([Brendan Fraser](/wiki/Brendan_Fraser \"Brendan Fraser\"))\nand [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") executive Kate Houghton\n([Jenna Elfman](/wiki/Jenna_Elfman \"Jenna Elfman\")) find the \"[blue\nmonkey](/wiki/Blue_monkey \"Blue monkey\")\" diamond in order to prevent the evil\nMr. Chairman ([Steve Martin](/wiki/Steve_Martin \"Steve Martin\")) of the [Acme\nCorporation](/wiki/Acme_Corporation \"Acme Corporation\") from using it to turn\nmankind into monkeys that will manufacture his products; the group also\nattempts to rescue D.J.'s father ([Timothy Dalton](/wiki/Timothy_Dalton\n\"Timothy Dalton\")), an actor and spy who has been captured by Mr. Chairman.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on November 14, 2003 with mixed-to-positive\ncritical reception.[3][4] However, the film was a [box office\nbomb](/wiki/Box_office_bomb \"Box office bomb\"),[5][6] grossing $68.5 million\nworldwide against an $80 million budget.[2] This was the final film to be\nscored by composer [Jerry Goldsmith](/wiki/Jerry_Goldsmith \"Jerry Goldsmith\"),\nwho died less than a year after the film's release. This was also the final\nfilm to be produced by [Warner Bros. Feature\nAnimation](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Animation \"Warner Bros.

Aspiring [stuntman](/wiki/Stuntman \"Stuntman\")\nDJ Drake is asked to escort Daffy off the studio lot, but the ensuing chase\nleads to the [Batmobile](/wiki/Batmobile \"Batmobile\") demolishing the studio\n[water tower](/wiki/Water_tower \"Water tower\"). DJ is also fired in the\nprocess, and returns home with Daffy hitching a ride, discovering his father,\n[action film](/wiki/Action_film \"Action film\") star, Damian Drake, is actually\na [secret agent](/wiki/Espionage \"Espionage\"). Damian instructs his son to\ntravel to [Las Vegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas \"Las Vegas\"), find his associate Dusty\nTails, and gain the mystical \"blue monkey\" [diamond](/wiki/Diamond \"Diamond\"),\nbut he is shortly thereafter captured by the [Acme\nCorporation](/wiki/Acme_Corporation \"Acme Corporation\"), led by the childish\nMr. Chairman. DJ and Daffy head for Vegas. Meanwhile, Bugs' routines fall\napart without Daffy, so \"Vice-President of Comedy,\" Kate Houghton, is sent to\nrehire Daffy or face being fired herself. Bugs informs Kate of the situation,\nso they steal Damian's spy car, and pursue DJ and Daffy.\n\nIn Las Vegas, DJ and Daffy meet Dusty in a [casino](/wiki/Casino \"Casino\")\nowned by Acme operative [Yosemite Sam](/wiki/Yosemite_Sam \"Yosemite Sam\").\nDusty gives them a strange playing card, but when Sam attempts to kill them,\nthey flee in the spy car with Bugs and Kate. The spy car, which can also\n[fly](/wiki/Flying_car_\\(aircraft\\) \"Flying car \\(aircraft\\)\"), crashes in the\nNevada desert. The group eventually stumbles upon [Area 52](/wiki/Area_51\n\"Area 51\"), run by a woman called 'mother', who informs them of the situation,\nand plays a video recording, which reveals that Acme intends on using the blue\nmonkey to transform mankind into monkeys to manufacture their products, before\nturning them back into human beings to purchase them. [Marvin the\nMartian](/wiki/Marvin_the_Martian \"Marvin the Martian\"), imprisoned in the\nfacility, escapes and leads a group of fellow alien inmates to obtain the\nplaying card, but the heroes escape. Seeing that the card has [Mona\nLisa](/wiki/Mona_Lisa \"Mona Lisa\")'s face on it, the group conclude they must\nview the painting in the [Louvre](/wiki/Louvre \"Louvre\"), located in\n[Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\").\n\nAt the Louvre, they discover that the card contains a viewing window, and\nlooking through it, the window reveals that the Mona Lisa has a map of\n[Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\") hidden beneath. [Elmer Fudd](/wiki/Elmer_Fudd\n\"Elmer Fudd\") appears, and, revealing himself as an Acme operative, chases\nBugs and Daffy through the gallery for the card whilst Kate is kidnapped by\nMr. Chairman's [bodyguard](/wiki/Bodyguard \"Bodyguard\"), Mr. Smith, to obtain\na photo of the African map. DJ rescues Kate. Elmer is disintegrated by Bugs\nafter jumping out of a pointillism artwork. Bugs and Daffy reunite with DJ and\nKate, and they leave Paris.\n\nDJ, Kate, Bugs, and Daffy travel to Africa, meeting Granny, Sylvester, and\nTweety, who escort them to the ruins of a jungle temple where they find the\nblue monkey. Granny and company reveal themselves to be Mr. Chairman, Smith,\nand the Tasmanian Devil in disguise. Mr. Chairman uses a [disintegration\ngun](/wiki/Duck_Dodgers_in_the_24%C2%BDth_Century \"Duck Dodgers in the 24Â½th\nCentury\") to transport himself and the heroes to the Acme headquarters where\nhe forces DJ to give him the diamond, when Damian is revealed to be his\nprisoner.\n\nMarvin is sent to place the blue monkey on an Acme satellite which will emit\nan energy beam around the world to turn everyone, except Mr. Chairman, into\nmonkeys. DJ and Kate rescue Damian from a death trap, whilst Bugs and Daffy\npursue Marvin into space. Bugs is incapacitated, prompting Daffy to become\n[Duck Dodgers](/wiki/Duck_Dodgers \"Duck Dodgers\"), in order to destroy the\nblue monkey. The transforming energy beam only strikes Mr. Chairman, turning\nhim into a monkey.\n\nBugs and Daffy return to Earth, where Daffy discovers the whole adventure was\nstaged to make a film. However, Bugs promises Daffy they will be equal\npartners, but just as Daffy's luck seems to be improving, he is flattened by\nthe Looney Tunes iris, where [Porky Pig](/wiki/Porky_Pig \"Porky Pig\") attempts\nto close the film with \"That's all folks!\" only for the studio to shut down\nbefore he can finish, and he tells the audience to go home.\n\n## Cast\n\n  * [Brendan Fraser](/wiki/Brendan_Fraser \"Brendan Fraser\") as D.J.

As development began, _Space Jam 2_ was going to\ninvolve a new [basketball](/wiki/Basketball \"Basketball\") competition between\nthe Looney Tunes and a new villain named Berserk-O!. Artist [Bob\nCamp](/wiki/Bob_Camp \"Bob Camp\") was tasked with designing Berserk-O! and his\nhenchmen. [Joe Pytka](/wiki/Joe_Pytka \"Joe Pytka\") would have returned to\ndirect and [Spike Brandt](/wiki/Spike_Brandt \"Spike Brandt\") and [Tony\nCervone](/wiki/Tony_Cervone \"Tony Cervone\") signed on as the animation\nsupervisors. However, [Michael Jordan](/wiki/Michael_Jordan \"Michael Jordan\")\ndid not agree to star in a sequel. According to Camp, a producer lied to\ndesign artists, claiming that Jordan had signed on in order to keep\ndevelopment going. Warner Bros. eventually canceled plans for _Space Jam\n2_.[10]\n\nThe film then re-entered development as _Spy Jam_ and was to star [Jackie\nChan](/wiki/Jackie_Chan \"Jackie Chan\"). Warner Bros. was also planning a film\ntitled _Race Jam_ which would have starred [Jeff Gordon](/wiki/Jeff_Gordon\n\"Jeff Gordon\"). Both projects were ultimately cancelled. Warner Bros.\neventually asked [Joe Dante](/wiki/Joe_Dante \"Joe Dante\") to direct _Back in\nAction_ , having had previous success with _[Gremlins](/wiki/Gremlins\n\"Gremlins\")_ (1984) and _[Innerspace](/wiki/Innerspace \"Innerspace\")_ (1987).\nIn the early 1990s, Dante wanted to produce a biographical comedy with\n[HBO](/wiki/HBO \"HBO\"), called _Termite Terrace_. It centered around director\n[Chuck Jones](/wiki/Chuck_Jones \"Chuck Jones\")' early years at Warner Bros. in\nthe 1930s. On the project, Dante recalled \"It was a hilarious story and it was\nvery good except that Warner Bros. said 'Look, itâs an old story. Itâs got\nperiod stuff in it. We donât want that. We want to rebrand our characters and\nwe want to do _Space Jam_.'\"[11]\n\nDante agreed to direct _Back in Action_ as tribute to Jones. He and\nscreenwriter [Larry Doyle](/wiki/Larry_Doyle_\\(writer\\) \"Larry Doyle\n\\(writer\\)\") reportedly wanted the film to the \"Anti-_Space Jam_ \" as Dante\ndisliked how that film represented the _Looney Tunes_ brand and personalities.\nDante said \"I was making a movie for them with those characters [_Looney\nTunes: Back in Action_] and they did not want to know about those characters.\nThey didnât want to know why [Bugs Bunny](/wiki/Bugs_Bunny \"Bugs Bunny\")\nshouldnât do hip-hop. It was a pretty grim experience all around.\" Warner\nBros. hired [Walt Disney Feature\nAnimation](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios \"Walt Disney Animation\nStudios\")'s [Eric Goldberg](/wiki/Eric_Goldberg_\\(film_director\\) \"Eric\nGoldberg \\(film director\\)\"), most known for his fast-paced, Warner\nBros.-inspired animation of the [Genie](/wiki/Genie_\\(Disney_character\\)\n\"Genie \\(Disney character\\)\") in _[Aladdin](/wiki/Aladdin_\\(1992_Disney_film\\)\n\"Aladdin \\(1992 Disney film\\)\")_ (1992), to direct the animation.\n\nOn the film, Dante stated \"It's a gagfest. Not having a particularly strong\nstory, it just goes from gag to gag and location to location. It's not a\nparticularly compelling narrative, but, of course, that's not where the charm\nof the movie is supposed to lie.\" On the subject of filming, Dante said \"[W]e\nwould shoot each scene three times. First we'd rehearse with a stand-inâa\n'stuffy,' we called it. Then, we'd shoot the scene without anything in it;\nthen, we'd shoot the scene again with this mirror ball in the shot which shows\nthe computers where the light sources are. Then the animators would go to work\nand put characters into the frame. The problem with that movie came when the\nstudio [executives] started to get tired of our jokes and wanted us to change\nthem. But, of course, the animation is done to the voices and not the other\nway around. It was difficult trying to convince them that you don't just bring\nin 25 gag writers and try to write a joke that's short enough to put in\nsomebody's mouth.\" Although the production had twenty-five gag writers, the\nfilm has only one credited writer.[12]\n\nDespite being directed by acknowledged fans of the original cartoons, Dante\nstated that he had no creative freedom on the project, and called it \"the\nlongest year and a half of my life.\" Dante felt that he and Goldberg managed\nto preserve the original personalities of the characters. However, the\nopening, middle, and end of the film are different from what Dante\nenvisioned.[13]\n\nGoldberg also provided the voices of [Tweety](/wiki/Tweety \"Tweety\"),\n[Michigan J. Frog](/wiki/Michigan_J._Frog \"Michigan J. Frog\"), [Marvin the\nMartian](/wiki/Marvin_the_Martian \"Marvin the Martian\") and [Speedy\nGonzales](/wiki/Speedy_Gonzales \"Speedy Gonzales\"). [Brendan\nFraser](/wiki/Brendan_Fraser \"Brendan Fraser\") provided the voice of the\n[Tazmanian Devil](/wiki/Tasmanian_Devil_\\(Looney_Tunes\\) \"Tasmanian Devil\n\\(Looney Tunes\\)\") and She-Devil, having impressed Dante with his Taz vocal\nimpression.\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nThis was the final film scored by composer [Jerry\nGoldsmith](/wiki/Jerry_Goldsmith \"Jerry Goldsmith\"). Due to Goldsmith's\nfailing health, the last reel of the film was actually scored by [John\nDebney](/wiki/John_Debney \"John Debney\"), though Goldsmith was the only\ncredited composer in marketing materials and the [VarÃ¨se\nSarabande](/wiki/Var%C3%A8se_Sarabande \"VarÃ¨se Sarabande\") soundtrack album\nonly contains Goldsmith's music (although the first and last cues are\nadaptations of compositions heard in Warner Bros. cartoons). Debney receives\nan \"Additional Music by\" credit in the closing titles of the film and \"Special\nThanks\" in the soundtrack album credits.[14] Goldsmith died in July 2004,\neight months after the film's release.\n\n  1.

The film grossed $68.5 million worldwide\nagainst a budget of $80 million.[15][5]\n\nWarner Bros. was hoping to start a revitalized franchise of _Looney Tunes_\nmedia and products with the success of _Back in Action_.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] New\nanimated shorts and [a _Duck Dodgers_ TV\nseries](/wiki/Duck_Dodgers_\\(TV_series\\) \"Duck Dodgers \\(TV series\\)\") were\ncommissioned to tie-in with _Back in Action_. The film instead triggered\nWarner Bros. to release new TV projects in an effort to re-brand the _Looney\nTunes_ such as _[Loonatics Unleashed](/wiki/Loonatics_Unleashed \"Loonatics\nUnleashed\")_ (2005â2007), _[The Looney Tunes Show](/wiki/The_Looney_Tunes_Show\n\"The Looney Tunes Show\")_ (2011â2014), and\n_[Wabbit](/wiki/Wabbit_\\(TV_series\\) \"Wabbit \\(TV series\\)\")_ (2015âpresent).\n\n### Critical response\n\nCritical response aggregation website [Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes\n\"Rotten Tomatoes\") gave the film an approval rating of 57% based on 134\nreviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"The plot is a nonsensical,\nhyperactive jumble and the gags are relatively uninspired compared to the\nclassic _Looney Tunes_ cartoons.\"[3] At [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic\n\"Metacritic\"), the film scored a 64/100, indicating \"generally favorable\nreviews\"[4] _[Chicago Sun-Times](/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times \"Chicago Sun-Times\")_\nmovie critics, [Roger Ebert](/wiki/Roger_Ebert \"Roger Ebert\") and [Richard\nRoeper](/wiki/Richard_Roeper \"Richard Roeper\"), gave the film \"Two Thumbs Up\";\nRoeper called it a \"cheerful and self-referential romp blending animation with\nlive action in a non-stop quest for silly laughs,\" while Ebert called it\n\"goofy fun.\"[16]\n\nThe film was also nominated for [Saturn Award for Best Animated\nFilm](/wiki/Saturn_Award_for_Best_Animated_Film \"Saturn Award for Best\nAnimated Film\"), [Annie Award for Best Animated\nFeature](/wiki/Annie_Award_for_Best_Animated_Feature \"Annie Award for Best\nAnimated Feature\") and [Satellite Award for Best Animated or Mixed Media\nFeature](/wiki/Satellite_Award_for_Best_Animated_or_Mixed_Media_Feature\n\"Satellite Award for Best Animated or Mixed Media Feature\").\n\n## Home media release\n\n[Warner Home Video](/wiki/Warner_Home_Video \"Warner Home Video\") released\n_Looney Tunes: Back in Action_ on [VHS](/wiki/VHS \"VHS\") and [DVD](/wiki/DVD\n\"DVD\") on March 2, 2004. The film was re-released on DVD in separate\n[widescreen](/wiki/Widescreen \"Widescreen\") and [full\nscreen](/wiki/Aspect_ratio_\\(image\\)#4:3_standard \"Aspect ratio \\(image\\)\")\neditions on September 7, 2010. It was also released on [Blu-ray](/wiki/Blu-ray\n\"Blu-ray\") with bonus features on December 2, 2014.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] A\ndouble DVD and [Blu-ray](/wiki/Blu-ray \"Blu-ray\") release, paired with _[Space\nJam](/wiki/Space_Jam \"Space Jam\")_ , was released on June 7, 2016.[17]\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Detail view of Movies Page\"](http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=62811). _afi.com_.
