It was released in February 1983 as\nthe lead single from his third studio album, _[Cuts Like a\nKnife](/wiki/Cuts_Like_a_Knife \"Cuts Like a Knife\")_. It was his breakthrough\nsong in the U.S., the first to make the [top 40](/wiki/Top_40 \"Top 40\"),\nreaching number 10.[1] It also peaked at #32 on the [Adult\nContemporary](/wiki/Hot_Adult_Contemporary_Tracks \"Hot Adult Contemporary\nTracks\") chart, the first Bryan Adams single to appear on that chart.\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Straight_from_the_Heart_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nAdams wrote the song when he was 18 in the late 1970s. Although Adams did not\nrelease his version of the song until 1983, the song was first recorded by\n[Ian Lloyd](/wiki/Ian_Lloyd_\\(musician\\) \"Ian Lloyd \\(musician\\)\") in 1980, on\nhis album _Third Wave Civilization_.[2] Australian singer [Jon\nEnglish](/wiki/Jon_English \"Jon English\") recorded the song for his 1981\nalbum, _[In Roads](/wiki/In_Roads \"In Roads\")_. The song peaked at number 72\nin Australia. Later, the song was covered by teen band Rosetta Stone in 1982\n(issued as a single in November that year, a month before Adams' version came\nout as a single). Welsh singer [Bonnie Tyler](/wiki/Bonnie_Tyler \"Bonnie\nTyler\") released it on a 45 in the US in May 1983. It was featured on her 1983\nalbum _[Faster Than the Speed of Night](/wiki/Faster_Than_the_Speed_of_Night\n\"Faster Than the Speed of Night\")_.\n\n## Chart\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Straight_from_the_Heart_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Chart history\")]\n\nChart (1983) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nAustralia ([Kent Music Report](/wiki/Kent_Music_Report \"Kent Music Report\"))[3] | 98  \nCanada Top Singles ([RPM](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\")) | 20  \nUK Singles ([The Official Charts Company](/wiki/The_Official_Charts_Company \"The Official Charts Company\")) | 51  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[4] | 10  \nUS _Billboard_ [Adult Contemporary](/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_\\(chart\\) \"Adult Contemporary \\(chart\\)\")[5] | 29  \nUS _Billboard_ [Mainstream Rock](/wiki/Mainstream_Rock_\\(chart\\) \"Mainstream Rock \\(chart\\)\")[4] | 32  \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Straight_from_the_Heart_\\(song\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Bryan Adams - Cuts Like A Knife](http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/albums-folder/pg-album-adams-03-cuts.html)\n  2. **Jump up ^** Viglione, Joe.
