So, it\nstarted blowing up all over the world and then we had a reason to tour all\nover the world. And that's how the whole international thing happened this\nearly. Which is awesome.\"\n\n—Amy Lee talking about the release and the worldwide success of the song.[1]\n\nAccording to Amy Lee, the song has several meanings, the first being an\nincident at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she\ntold _[The Boston Phoenix](/wiki/The_Phoenix_\\(newspaper\\) \"The Phoenix\n\\(newspaper\\)\")_ : \"I was inspired to write it when someone said something to\nme — I didn’t know him, and I thought he might be clairvoyant.[...] I was in a\nrelationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being\ncompletely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to\nmyself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a\nfriend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went\ninto a restaurant and got a table. And he looked at me and said, ‘Are you\nhappy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m\nthinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant.\nBut he _is_ a sociology major.\"[2] Lee said in a [VH1](/wiki/VH1 \"VH1\")\ninterview: \"Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've\nbeen missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart\nrace for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going\nthrough the motions of life.\"[3] During an interview with\n_[Blender](/wiki/Blender_\\(magazine\\) \"Blender \\(magazine\\)\")_ , Lee claimed\nthat she wrote \"Bring Me to Life\" about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler,\nwhom she married in 2007.[4]\n\n\"Bring Me to Life\" was released on April 22, 2003; it was the first single\nfrom the band's debut album, _[Fallen](/wiki/Fallen_\\(Evanescence_album\\)\n\"Fallen \\(Evanescence album\\)\")_. Wind-up Entertainment president/CEO Ed\nVetri, revealed that when the label was pushing the song to the radio, owners\nstated \"We don't play pianos and chicks on rock radio.\"[5] However, when\n\"Bring Me to Life\" was released on the _Daredevil_ soundtrack, listeners\ndemanded air play for the song.[5] The single includes \"Farther Away\" as a\n[B-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and B-side\"). The first pressing of\nthe Australian single contained the track \"Missing\" as a B-side,[6] but this\nwas omitted from later pressings and later released as a bonus track on the\nband's first live album, _[Anywhere but Home](/wiki/Anywhere_but_Home\n\"Anywhere but Home\")_.[7] An acoustic version was recorded and released on the\n\"Bring Me to Life\" DVD.
