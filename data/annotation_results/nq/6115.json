By volume, it is the\n[largest known living single stem tree](/wiki/List_of_largest_giant_sequoias\n\"List of largest giant sequoias\") on Earth.[1]\n\nWhile the General Sherman is the largest currently living tree, it is not the\nlargest historically-recorded tree. The Crannell Creek Giant, a coast redwood\n(_[Sequoia sempervirens](/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens \"Sequoia sempervirens\")_)\nnear [Trinidad, California](/wiki/Trinidad,_California \"Trinidad,\nCalifornia\"), is estimated to have been 15 to 25% larger than the General\nSherman tree by volume. That tree was cut down in the mid-1940s. Another\nlarger coast redwood, near 90,000 cubic feet, the [Lindsey Creek\ntree](/wiki/Lindsey_Creek_tree \"Lindsey Creek tree\"), was reported in a 1905\n_Humboldt Times Standard_ article.[2][3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Dimensions\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=General_Sherman_\\(tree\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe General Sherman was named after the [American Civil\nWar](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") general [William Tecumseh\nSherman](/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman \"William Tecumseh Sherman\"), in 1879\nby [naturalist](/wiki/Natural_history \"Natural history\") James Wolverton, who\nhad served as a [lieutenant](/wiki/Lieutenant \"Lieutenant\") in the 9th Indiana\nCavalry under Sherman. In 1931, following comparisons with the nearby [General\nGrant tree](/wiki/General_Grant_tree \"General Grant tree\"), General Sherman\nwas identified as the largest tree in the world. One result of this process\nwas that wood volume became widely accepted as the standard for establishing\nand comparing the size of different trees.[1][4]\n\nIn January 2006 the largest branch on the tree (seen most commonly, in older\nphotos, as an \"L\" or golf-club shape, protruding from about a quarter of the\nway down the trunk) broke off. There were no witnesses to the incident, and\nthe branch — larger than most tree trunks; diameter over 2 m (6.6 ft) and\nlength over 30 m (98 ft) — smashed part of the perimeter fence and cratered\nthe pavement of the surrounding walkway. The breakage is not believed to be\nindicative of any abnormalities in the tree's health, and may even be a\nnatural defense mechanism against adverse weather conditions.[5]\n\n##\nDimensions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=General_Sherman_\\(tree\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Dimensions\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/General_Sherman_tree_looking_up.jpg/170px-\nGeneral_Sherman_tree_looking_up.jpg)](/wiki/File:General_Sherman_tree_looking_up.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:General_Sherman_tree_looking_up.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLooking upward from the base of the General Sherman located in\n[California's](/wiki/California \"California\") [Sequoia National\nPark](/wiki/Sequoia_National_Park \"Sequoia National Park\")\n\nWhile it is the largest tree known, the General Sherman Tree is neither the\ntallest known living tree on Earth (that distinction belongs to the [Hyperion\ntree](/wiki/Hyperion_\\(tree\\) \"Hyperion \\(tree\\)\"), a [Coast\nredwood](/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens \"Sequoia sempervirens\")),[6] nor is it the\nwidest (both the largest [cypress](/wiki/Cypress \"Cypress\") and largest\n[baobab](/wiki/Baobab \"Baobab\") have a greater diameter), nor is it the oldest\nknown living tree on Earth ([that distinction](/wiki/List_of_oldest_trees\n\"List of oldest trees\") belongs to a [Great Basin bristlecone\npine](/wiki/Pinus_longaeva \"Pinus longaeva\")).[7] With a height of 83.8 meters\n(275 ft), a diameter of 7.7 m (25 ft), an estimated\n[bole](/wiki/Trunk_\\(botany\\) \"Trunk \\(botany\\)\") volume of 1,487 m3 (52,513\ncu ft), and an estimated age of 2,300–2,700 years,[8][9][10] it is\nnevertheless among the tallest, widest, and [longest-\nlived](/wiki/List_of_oldest_trees \"List of oldest trees\") of all trees on the\nplanet.\n\nHeight above base[1] | 274.9 ft | 83.8 m  \n---|---|---  \nCircumference at ground[1] | 102.6 ft | 31.3 m  \nMaximum diameter at base[1] | 36.5 ft | 11.1 m  \nDiameter 4.5 ft (1.4 m) above height point on ground[11] | 25.1 ft | 7.7 m  \nGirth Diameter 60 ft (18 m) above base[1] | 17.5 ft | 5.3 m  \nDiameter 180 ft (55 m) above base[1] | 14.0 ft | 4.3 m  \nDiameter of largest branch[1] | 6.8 ft | 2.1 m  \nHeight of first large branch above the base[1] | 130.0 ft | 39.6 m  \nAverage crown spread[1] | 106.5 ft | 32.5 m  \nEstimated [bole](/wiki/Trunk_\\(botany\\) \"Trunk \\(botany\\)\") volume[11] | 52,508 cu ft | 1,487 m3  \nEstimated mass (wet) (1938)[12] | 2,105 short tons | 1,910 t  \nEstimated [bole](/wiki/Trunk_\\(botany\\) \"Trunk \\(botany\\)\") mass (1938)[12] | 2,472,000 lb | 1,121 t  \n  \n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=General_Sherman_\\(tree\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of largest giant sequoias](/wiki/List_of_largest_giant_sequoias \"List of largest giant sequoias\")\n  * [List of superlative trees](/wiki/List_of_superlative_trees \"List of superlative trees\")\n  * [List of trees](/wiki/List_of_trees \"List of trees\")\n  * [National Register of Big Trees](/wiki/National_Register_of_Big_Trees \"National Register of Big Trees\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=General_Sherman_\\(tree\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ _**h**_ _**i**_ _**j**_ [\"The General Sherman Tree\"](http://www.nps.gov/seki/naturescience/sherman.htm). _Sequoia National Park_.
