A missile system that can be dispersed far and wide in the Indian\nmainland, its far flung islands or its blue water naval assets dispersed\nacross the world's oceans. Following this necessity India developed a larger\nAgni-III missile, with a heavier payload and a longer range but in a compact\nconfiguration, i.e. thicker but shorter length. This development is driven by\nneed for a more assured retaliation that can defeat emerging [anti ballistic\nmissile](/wiki/Anti_ballistic_missile \"Anti ballistic missile\") (ABM) defence\nand countermeasures. Such capability requires a compact missile that can also\ncarry ABM counter-measure payloads along with weapons, in a configuration\nsimilar to a [MIRV](/wiki/MIRV \"MIRV\"), albeit with state-of-the-art decoys.\nThe Deputy Project director who was responsible for the writing of the user\nhandbook manual was Lieutenant Colonel Rajeev Sharma.[17]\n\n## Description[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agni-III&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Description\")]\n\nAgni III was developed as the successor to [Agni-II](/wiki/Agni-II \"Agni-\nII\").[6] Designed by the [Indian government's](/wiki/Government_of_India\n\"Government of India\") [Defence Research and Development\nOrganisation](/wiki/Defence_Research_and_Development_Organisation \"Defence\nResearch and Development Organisation\"), Agni III is a [two-\nstage](/wiki/Multistage_rocket \"Multistage rocket\") [ballistic\nmissile](/wiki/Ballistic_missile \"Ballistic missile\") that is capable of\n[nuclear weapons delivery](/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_delivery \"Nuclear weapons\ndelivery\"). It was designed and developed by the Advanced Systems Laboratory\n(ASL),[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] a unit of DRDO, which was formed in September 2001 with its main\nobjective being the development of large-sized rocket motors. ASL developed\nthe propulsion plant for solid-fuel motors, including the infrastructure for\npropellant casting. The stubby two-stage solid fuel missile is compact and\nsmall enough for easy mobility and flexible deployment on various surface/sub-\nsurface platforms.[18]\n\nThe missile is equipped with sophisticated navigation, guidance and control\nsystems along with advanced on-board computer systems. The electronic systems\nare hardened for higher vibration, thermal and acoustic effects. A high\nperformance indigenous ring laser gyro-based navigation system was flight-\ntested for the first time during the Agni-III trial on 7 Feb 2010.[19]\n\nThe Agni-III has two stages with an overall diameter of two meters. Initially,\nthe first stage mass was about 32 tonnes and 7.7 m long, the second stage mass\nwas about 10 tonnes and 3.3 m long. The missile is likely to support a wide\nrange of [warhead](/wiki/Warhead \"Warhead\") configurations, with a 4,500 km\nrange and a total payload weight of 2490 kg.[6]\n\n## Weight reduction and missile redesign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agni-\nIII&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Weight reduction and missile\nredesign\")]\n\nDRDO carried out extensive technological enhancement to enhance the\nperformance and to reduce the weight of the Agni-III missile system and to\nachieve this the entire system was redesigned including the use of [maraging\nsteel](/wiki/Maraging_steel \"Maraging steel\") and a composite motor rocket.\nThe weight of the Agni-III missile has been reduced to 22 tonnes.[3]\n\n## Propulsion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agni-III&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Propulsion\")]\n\nThe Agni-III features two [solid fuelled](/wiki/Solid_rocket \"Solid rocket\")\nstages and with overall diameter of 2.0 meters. This diameter is compatible\nwith a recently tested Indian sub-surface launch system, which has a 2.3 meter\ndiameter launch tube aperture.\n\nThe first stage booster is made of advanced carbon composite materials to\nprovide high [payload fraction (mass fraction)](/wiki/Payload_fraction\n\"Payload fraction\"). It is 7.7 meters long, with a diameter of 2 metres. The\nsecond stage made of maraging steel and has a length of 3.3 metres. The second\nstage has [vectoring nozzles](/wiki/Vectoring_nozzles \"Vectoring nozzles\"), to\nprovide necessary flight trajectory control.\n\n## Maneuvering re-entry vehicle Agni RV Mk 4[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agni-\nIII&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Maneuvering re-entry vehicle Agni RV\nMk 4\")]\n\nAgni-III supports a wide range of weapons, with total payload weight ranging\nfrom ~600 kg to 1,800 kg including decoys and other ABM countermeasures.\nInstead of conventional bus architecture, the RV (Re-Entry Vehicle) is self-\ncontained with velocity correction package, [navigation](/wiki/Navigation\n\"Navigation\") and [re-entry](/wiki/Re-entry \"Re-entry\") control\nsystems.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe lighter and tougher RV body has an all-carbon composite re-entry heat\nshield with multi-directional carbon re-entry nose tip and control surfaces.\nThe new lightweight composites can withstand temperatures of up to 6000\ndegrees Celsius, and are capable of greater re-entry velocity.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## K-4 SLBM[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agni-III&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: K-4 SLBM\")]\n\nMain article: [K-4 (SLBM)](/wiki/K-4_\\(SLBM\\) \"K-4 \\(SLBM\\)\")\n\nThe K-4 missile is one of the series of missile developed under the [K-X\nseries](/wiki/K_Missile_family \"K Missile family\").[20] DRDO is working on a\nsubmarine-launched version of the Agni-III missile, which will provide India\nwith a credible sea-based second-strike capability.[21] The K-4 missile, with\na range of 3500 km, has been test-fired successfully multiple times-both from\nunderwater pontoons and from INS Arihant. The K-4 SLBM is expected to be the\nprincipal intermediate range missile for the Arihant class nuclear submarines.\nAn as-yet unnamed variant of K-4 with 5000 km range is under development.[22]\n\n## Flight tests[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agni-III&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Flight tests\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Agni_missile_range.svg/220px-\nAgni_missile_range.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Agni_missile_range.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Agni_missile_range.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAgni missile range\n\nThe first test for Agni III was conducted from [Abdul Kalam\nIsland](/wiki/Abdul_Kalam_Island \"Abdul Kalam Island\") (then known as Wheeler\nIsland) off the [Bhadrak](/wiki/Bhadrak \"Bhadrak\") coast on 9 July 2006.[6]\nThe launch proved to be unsuccessful, with the missile falling into the sea\noff the coast of [Odisha](/wiki/Odisha \"Odisha\"), short of reaching the\ntarget. According to [DRDO](/wiki/DRDO \"DRDO\"), the failure was due to a first\nstage anomaly that was caused by recirculating hot gases entering the missile-\nbase shroud and damaging the electronic components.[23] Indian Defence\nMinister [Pranab Mukherjee](/wiki/Pranab_Mukherjee \"Pranab Mukherjee\")\nreported it as \"partial success\" (a trade euphemism to indicate the test\ngenerated useful data for diagnosis and correction) as the missile was air-\nborne for only 5 minutes instead of the expected 15 minutes.[24]\n\nAgni-III was test fired again on 12 April 2007, from the Abdul Kalam Island\noff the coast of Odisha. This time, the launch was declared as a success.\nIndia's [Cabinet Committee on Security](/wiki/Cabinet_Committee_on_Security\n\"Cabinet Committee on Security\") announced that[25] \"This test confirms the\nextent of India's nuclear reach and India's [nuclear\ndeterrence](/wiki/Nuclear_deterrence \"Nuclear deterrence\") as the missile can\naccurately hit targets at distance more than 3000 km away\".[26]\n\nAlready the most powerful and capable in India's missile inventory, the Agni-\nIII is capable of carrying a variety of warheads, including nuclear warheads\nand can be launched from various platforms giving India intermediate range\nballistic missile firepower and greatly extending India's [power\nprojection](/wiki/Power_projection \"Power projection\") in the region.[27][28]\n\nAgni III was test fired successfully for third time on 7 May 2008.[29] The\nmissile was launched from Balasore, Odisha.[30] After a flight of roughly 15\nminutes defence scientists confirmed that the test fire was successful and\nthat the missile met all parameters. The missile has a velocity of 5,000\nmeters per second. Agni-III is a nuclear capable fully solid propellant\nfuelled surface-to-surface missile, and has a range of 3,500 km. A new\nsoftware for navigation system fitted on the missile will increase accuracy\nand lethality.[31] The successful test on 7 May opened the doors for the next\ngeneration Indian ICBM Agni V with a range of 5,000–6,000 kilometres.[32]\n\nThe development test of Agni III was put off for unknown reasons in August\n2009.[33]\n\nAgni III was tested successfully for the fourth time from Abdul Kalam Island\nin Odisha on 7 February 2010. The missile is said to have hit the target with\npin point accuracy and met all the mission objectives. Two down range ships\nlocated near the target tracked and witnessed the Missile reaching the target\naccurately.[34] The missile is likely to support a wide range of warhead\nconfigurations, with a 3,500 km range and a total payload weight of 2490\nkg.[7] The two-stage solid fuel missile is compact and small enough for easy\nmobility and flexible deployment on various surface/sub-surface platforms. The\ntest validated the nuclear triggering mechanism, meaning Agni-III is meant for\nstrategic nuclear deterrence.[7] The test launch is part of pre-induction of\nthe missile into the [Indian Army](/wiki/Indian_Army \"Indian Army\").[35]\n\nIn August 2010, the defence minister of India announced that Agni-III is ready\nfor induction[36] and in June 2011, it was reported that the Agni-III missile\nhad already been inducted into the armed forces.[15]\n\nIn September 2012, it is reported that a missile group is now being raised\nwith Agni-III missiles.[37]\n\nOn 21 September 2012, as part of regular user-training the [Strategic Forces\nCommand](/wiki/Strategic_Forces_Command \"Strategic Forces Command\") test fired\nan Agni III missile from a rail mobile launcher. The missile was randomly\nchosen from a production lot. All mission objectives were achieved and the\nmissile hit the pre-designated target with a two-digit accuracy.[38]\n\nOn 23 December 2013, the missile was tested by the Strategic Forces Command of\nthe Indian Army. The test was a success.[39]\n\nOn 16 April 2015, Agni-III was tested successfully from Abdul Kalam Island off\nOdisha coast. \"The trial, carried out by the Strategic Forces Command (SFC of\nthe Indian Army), was fully successful,\" ITR Director M V K V Prasad told\nPTI.[40]\n\nOn 27 April 2017, Agni-III was tested successfully the launch Pad No. 4 of the\nIntegrated Test Range at 9.12 a.m off Odisha coast. The Strategic Forces\nCommand (SFC) carried out test with support from DRDO.[41][42]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agni-III&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Subramanian, T.S.
