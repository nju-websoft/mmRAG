Matt,\nMary, Lucy, Simon, Ruthie, Sam, and David.\n\n### Eric\nCamden[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_7th_Heaven_characters&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Eric Camden\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Stephen_Collins_2014.jpg/150px-\nStephen_Collins_2014.jpg)](/wiki/File:Stephen_Collins_2014.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Stephen_Collins_2014.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStephen Collins as Rev. Eric Camden\n\nRev. Eric Camden (played by [Stephen Collins](/wiki/Stephen_Collins_\\(actor\\)\n\"Stephen Collins \\(actor\\)\")) was raised in [Binghamton, New\nYork](/wiki/Binghamton,_New_York \"Binghamton, New York\") by his parents,\nColonel John Camden and Ruth Lynch. Based on the episode \"Halloween\" (season\n1), it appears that Eric was born in 1954 (which would make him 42 years old\nat the time). According to the episode \"One Hundred\" (season 5), his birthday\nis in January. Eric attended college for five years and graduated from Cobell\nSeminary. Shortly thereafter, he married and began a family with Annie\nJackson. He has one sister, Julie Camden-Hastings, who ends up marrying the\ndoctor that delivered Eric and Annie's oldest (Matt), as well as the youngest\n(Sam and David) children. After his heart-bypass operation, he decides to\nleave the ministry and even stop attending church. He renews his faith and\nreturns to church in time to marry Kevin and Lucy (near the end of season 7).\n\n### Annie\nCamden[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_7th_Heaven_characters&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Annie Camden\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Catherine_Hicks2005.jpg/150px-\nCatherine_Hicks2005.jpg)](/wiki/File:Catherine_Hicks2005.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Catherine_Hicks2005.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCatherine Hicks as Annie Camden\n\nAnnie Camden (née Jackson) (played by [Catherine Hicks](/wiki/Catherine_Hicks\n\"Catherine Hicks\")) is the wife of Eric and mother of Matt, Mary, Lucy, Simon,\nRuthie, Sam, and David. She has a half-sister named Lily, through her father,\nCharles Jackson. Her mother is Jenny Jackson. During her college education,\nAnnie studied everything from art to business and economics, and in later\nseasons returned to school to earn a degree in early childhood education.\n\nThough she has chosen to be a stay-at-home mother, Annie is a jack of all\ntrades. She balances a family of nine on a minister's pay, is a plumber,\nbuilder, seamstress, cook, and much more. She also serves, from time to time,\nas the treasurer for the church.\n\nAnnie is the backbone of her family. The mother of seven, she is often the one\nwho the children come to talk to, often over milk and cookies. She tries, with\nher husband, to instill strong morals in her children. She is noted as hoping\nRuthie will not follow in her footsteps or of her two other daughters and\nmarry too young. She hopes Ruthie will take the time to travel first.\n\nAnnie is the only daughter of her parents. Her mother, Jenny, dies early in\nthe first season from cancer, a death that strikes Annie hard. Harder yet is\nher father's quick bounce to a relationship with Ginger. During one episode,\nAnnie leaves the church after her father brings Ginger to service. Mary chases\nher and is struck by a car. Annie accepts Ginger slowly and Ginger and her\nfather wed. Her father suffers from Alzheimer's disease and Annie spends more\nand more time with him in Arizona before he dies. Annie is quoted in later\nseasons as saying that she likes Ginger a lot more now that her parents are\nback together. In an early season, Annie learned of an illegitimate daughter\nher father had with his high school girlfriend. She eventually meets this\nhalf-sister, Lily, and the two form a relationship over time.\n\nIn 2009, she was included in [Yahoo!](/wiki/Yahoo! \"Yahoo!\")'s Top 10 TV Moms\nfrom Six Decades of Television for the decade 1996–2007.[3]\n\n### Matt\nCamden[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_7th_Heaven_characters&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Matt Camden\")]\n\nMatthew \"Matt\" Camden (played by [Barry Watson](/wiki/Barry_Watson_\\(actor\\)\n\"Barry Watson \\(actor\\)\")) (born 1980) is Annie and Eric's firstborn. In the\nbeginning of the series, Matt is a junior in high school. Matt sacrifices his\nschool time to help others; if they wished to remain anonymous, he would\nrespect that and not even tell his father. During high school, he bounces from\njob to job, including tutor and Dairy Shack delivery driver. He is not always\na star student, but he manages to graduate at the top of his class and get\naccepted for a White House internship in [Washington,\nD.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\") with First Lady [Hillary\nClinton](/wiki/Hillary_Clinton \"Hillary Clinton\"). He returns to Glenoak for\ncollege, rooming with friend and fellow \"P.K.\" John Hamilton. Matt's new\nuncle, Dr. Hank Hastings (who had actually delivered him), helps him get a job\nin the hospital cafeteria; during his time there, he decides to become a\ndoctor. He ends up working at a women's clinic with Hank, beginning by helping\nsave the life of a woman who could not get anyone but Matt to take her\nsymptoms of an [ectopic pregnancy](/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy \"Ectopic\npregnancy\") seriously.\n\nHe meets Sarah Glass (played by [Sarah Danielle\nMadison](/wiki/Sarah_Danielle_Madison \"Sarah Danielle Madison\")), a fellow\nmedical student, just when he really wished to meet the one who would be the\nlove of his life. Their first date ends with them getting married. Because\nSarah is the daughter of a rabbi (played by [Richard\nLewis](/wiki/Richard_Lewis_\\(comedian\\) \"Richard Lewis \\(comedian\\)\")) who\nwants his daughter to marry a Jewish man, they initially keep their marriage a\nsecret. They eventually have a large family wedding presided over jointly by\ntheir proud fathers, who almost called off the wedding feuding over Matt, who\nplans to convert to Judaism. Matt and Sarah move to New York to attend medical\nschool, and while there have been problems, they have remained happy together.\nNear the series' end, they graduate from medical school and announce that they\nare expecting twin boys, who are born the following summer. It is also shown\nthroughout the series that he knows [American Sign\nLanguage](/wiki/American_Sign_Language \"American Sign Language\"), a result of\nhis relationship with Heather, making him bilingual.\n\n### Simon\nCamden[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_7th_Heaven_characters&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Simon Camden\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/David_Gallagher.jpg/150px-\nDavid_Gallagher.jpg)](/wiki/File:David_Gallagher.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:David_Gallagher.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDavid Gallagher as Simon Camden\n\nSimon Camden (played by [David Gallagher](/wiki/David_Gallagher \"David\nGallagher\")) (born 1986) is the fourth child and second son. In the early part\nof the series, he is known to his siblings as \"The Bank of Simon\" because he\nalways seems to have money, and he loves to make money. His other interests\nhave included golf, magic, and cars.\n\nDuring the pilot episode, Simon's most fervent wish is for a dog. When asked\nto say grace before the family had dinner, he even includes a dog request in\nhis prayer. Although his parents do not think he is mature enough for the\nresponsibility of a pet, Annie goes to the pound \"just to look\" and falls in\nlove with a dog who was scheduled to be [euthanized](/wiki/Euthanized\n\"Euthanized\"). This dog became the Camdens' beloved \"Happy.\"\n\nHe meets a girl named Deena in sixth grade, and finds out that Eric consoled\nher family years ago when she was diagnosed with [leukemia](/wiki/Leukemia\n\"Leukemia\"). They date for the majority of middle school, but break up on the\nlast day of eighth grade, though they remain friends.\n\nHigh school is a rough transition for Simon, despite help from his bubbly,\npopular big sister Lucy. He dates a girl named Cecilia Smith ([Ashlee\nSimpson](/wiki/Ashlee_Simpson \"Ashlee Simpson\")), and they even consider\nfurthering their relationship sexually, but decide against it. The summer\nbefore his senior year, Simon accidentally hits and kills a boy named Paul\nSmith, who was Ruthie's age. Since Paul was on a bicycle with no helmet and\nlater proven to be under the influence of drugs, the death is ruled accidental\nand Simon is not brought up on criminal charges. However, Simon can't stop\nblaming himself for the accident and also fears retaliation from Paul's older\nbrother. He passes the [CHSPE](/wiki/CHSPE \"CHSPE\") and leaves school early to\nstart college. While in college, partly as a way to cope with his guilty\nfeelings and low self-esteem, he breaks the family's edict of not having\npremarital sex.\n\nSimon has three serious girlfriends over the course of the show: Deena,\nCecilia and Rose. Simon later gets involved with a girl that he knew from\ncollege named Sandy, who has a son named Aaron, fathered by Martin Brewer.\nSimon provides emotional and, at one point, maybe even physical support for\nSandy and her son.\n\nAfter a scare involving his girlfriend Georgia being pregnant (it is later\nrevealed that she only made the claim so Simon would stay with her), he meets\nRose. Rose and Simon fall deeply in love, get engaged, and plan a wedding.\nThey finally get to the wedding day, but they decide to not get married\nbecause neither is ready for marriage, and Rose still has feelings for an ex-\nboyfriend. Near the end of the series, Sandy and her son Aaron show up to the\nparty after the non-wedding, and Sandy says she needs to talk to him. However,\nit is not revealed what Sandy wanted to tell Simon, but it is assumed that it\nis about Aaron's paternity; it had been hinted that Simon was in fact Aaron's\nfather. Season 11, confirmed he is not the father. Simon eventually goes on to\nmarry someone else or get engaged (as hinted by Ruthie in season 11), but it\nis unknown who, although we do find out that he graduates from college.\n\n### Mary\nCamden[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_7th_Heaven_characters&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Mary Camden\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Jessica_Biel_2013.jpg/150px-\nJessica_Biel_2013.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jessica_Biel_2013.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jessica_Biel_2013.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJessica Biel as Mary Camden\n\nMary Camden-Rivera (played by [Jessica Biel](/wiki/Jessica_Biel \"Jessica\nBiel\")) (born 1982) is the eldest daughter of Eric and Annie. By the time she\nis 14, Mary is an aspiring athlete with an immense love for basketball. As the\nmonths progress, she seems to rise in both ability and confidence (so much so\nthat she wants to play in the [WNBA](/wiki/WNBA \"WNBA\") someday) until she is\nhit by a car before the end of her freshman year, critically injuring her\nknee. She has a series of different boyfriends. She dates Wilson West, a guy\nshe meets at the park while with Ruthie, who becomes her first love. He later\nreveals to Mary that he had sex with a sixteen-year-old girl, and got her\npregnant. The girl died in childbirth, leaving Wilson with a son, Billy\n(actually named Wilson Jr.). By her senior year, she and her basketball\nteammates allow their grades to slip, which causes their coach to impose a\nlockout on them. After a secret meeting, the team decides to enact their\nfrustrations by vandalizing the school gym. They are caught at the scene of\nthe crime, and are arrested. Through a special program for first offenders,\nMary is able to evade serious punishment by doing community service, which is\nwhere she meets Robbie Palmer. When she gets her driver's license, she can't\nparallel park but, on Lucy's advice, cries about it and the driving instructor\ncompassionately gives her a passing grade. Mary has a dream of playing pro for\nthe Lakers, and thinks that when her coach rings her up that this is the dream\ncoming true, but it's actually training disabled people for the [Special\nOlympics](/wiki/Special_Olympics \"Special Olympics\").\n\nMary decides not to go to college since she lost her scholarship, but work\ninstead. She cannot hold down a job, being fired everywhere, from The Pool\nHall to Pete’s Pizza. While working at Pete’s, she meets Frankie and Johnny, a\nyoung, drug-addicted married couple who have a baby girl named Mercy. Eric and\nAnnie learn that Mary has been caught drinking while babysitting her cousin,\nErica, pulled over by a cop, and given a warning, and that she has numerous\ndebts to credit card companies, insurance companies, and to her family. Not\nwanting Mary to hit rock bottom, Eric and Annie decide it is best that she go\nto Buffalo because they can't give her the attention she needs. She lives with\nher grandparents, works at a homeless shelter in the fall, and starts college\nin the winter. Her departure causes some people in the church community to\nthink that Mary had an unplanned pregnancy, but Eric quickly refutes the\nrumor. She leaves home angry at her entire family, whom she sees as betraying\nher, and refuses to speak to her father. In time, she calms down and plans to\nreturn home for the summer, as she and Robbie start dating again.\n\nWhile in New York, she discovers that Wilson is also living there. Instead of\nstaying in Glenoak for the summer like she originally planned, she breaks up\nwith Robbie and moves back to New York and starts dating Wilson. After getting\nadvice from the Colonel, she decides to get a job in public service. When she\ncan’t become a police officer because she is not old enough, she applies for a\nposition as a firefighter, and, after the Colonel pulls some strings, she gets\ninto the firefighter program. When she starts training, she meets Ben Kinkirk,\nwho is also in training. He comes over to her place and they kiss, which\nWilson walks in on. The two break up and she returns home to California for a\ntime, but on a trip to New York with Lucy, she reveals that she is moving back\nto New York to train to be a flight attendant. She begins dating a pilot,\nJack, who is the same age as her father, though this does not last. She moves\nto Florida for a time to get away from her family. While in Florida, Mary runs\ninto Carlos Rivera, a man she had met while volunteering at a homeless shelter\nyears earlier, and who the Camdens took in during the holiday season. Carlos\nand Mary get married shortly after Lucy, and they reveal her pregnancy and the\nmarriage to her family at that time. Her parents visit at the birth of her\nson, Charles Miguel \"Charlie\", named in honor of her and Carlos' late\ngrandfathers. They eventually divorce and Carlos takes Charlie back to [Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto Rico\") when Mary gives her parental rights up.\nIt is announced by Carlos when he attends Simon's wedding that the two are\nback together and that Mary is expecting twin girls. Though Mary is not at\nSimon's wedding, she is able to still see her family the next day, as she\nfinally graduates from college the same day as Matt and Sarah. During the\nfollowing summer, Mary gives birth to twin daughters.\n\n### Lucy Camden-\nKinkirk[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_7th_Heaven_characters&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Lucy Camden-Kinkirk\")]\n\nLucy Camden-Kinkirk (played by [Beverley Mitchell](/wiki/Beverley_Mitchell\n\"Beverley Mitchell\")) (born 1983) is the third Camden child, and second\ndaughter. Lucy is known (in the earlier seasons) for the many boyfriends she\nhas, as well as being overly dramatic. Until season 4, she is often seen as\n\"less than\" her sister Mary and her emotions often get her into trouble. By\nthe time she reaches her junior year in high school, however, Lucy becomes\nmuch more settled and switches positions with Mary, becoming the good kid. Her\nfirst boyfriend is Jimmy Moon. She has one \"normal\" relationship with him, but\nthey break up. In the beginning of season two, she is crying all summer and\nsays that Jimmy is dating Ashley. At one point, she gets arrested for being in\nthe area where Jimmy is dealing drugs. Later, Jimmy is shown when he had some\nproblems with drugs, and the last time is when Lucy had a case as juror\n(though nobody told her what it was about; because she knew the defendant\npersonally, she was dismissed). In school, she has lots of friends and is\npopular—including being nominated for homecoming queen in her senior year. She\nhas a very good relationship with her friend Mike, who is placed in a mental\nhospital and is otherwise ostracized. Although Mike likes Lucy, it never quite\nworks out. Later Lucy becomes engaged to Mike's friend, Jeremy, but they\neventually break it off.\n\nIn season seven, she marries Kevin Kinkirk and has a daughter named Savannah\n(Leigh) (season 9). They live in the apartment above the garage at the\nCamdens' house up until Savannah is a few months old.

At the end of the summer,\nshe tells Kevin that she doesn't want to have any more children. She is a\nworking mother (working as an associate pastor), while her husband Kevin is a\n[stay-at-home dad](/wiki/Stay-at-home_dad \"Stay-at-home dad\"). However, Kevin\nis offered a job as a police sheriff in \"Crossroads\". Later on, Lucy helps a\nyoung woman named Sandy with her pregnancy, and they soon become friends. In\nthe end, Lucy continues as a minister, friend, mother and wife. She is offered\nanother position in a different town as a minister, and announces that she is\npregnant once again with twin daughters.\n\n### Ruthie\nCamden[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_7th_Heaven_characters&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Ruthie Camden\")]\n\nRuthie Camden (played by [Mackenzie Rosman](/wiki/Mackenzie_Rosman \"Mackenzie\nRosman\")) (born 1991) is the youngest daughter.

She ages rapidly over the show's run, beginning pre-Kindergarten\nduring the first season and ending the series graduating high school a year\nearly at age 17. One of her teachers tries to call her \"Ruth\" as she assumes\nit is her given name, but Ruthie says her given name is \"Ruthie\". In later\nseasons, she tells Robbie she has never had a nickname. She and Simon have\nlots of fun together as children, and become very close as they move toward\nmaturity.\n\nRuthie is the only one to briefly attend a private school, but she leaves it\nin protest that her friend Yasmine is being denied admission because she is a\nMuslim. During her freshman year she develops feelings for Camden houseguest\nMartin Brewer and even tells him she loves him—but quickly covers by adding\n\"as a brother.\" In her sophomore year of high school she begins to wear makeup\nand dates older boys in the hope that this would lead to a relationship with\nMartin. In season ten's \"Love and Obsession\", she dreams everything from\nMartin telling her that a paternity test had proved that Simon, not Martin, is\nAaron's father; to there being no Aaron at all because Martin had never met\nSandy. When her former boyfriend and first love Peter returns during this\ntime, she realizes that she had moved on from him. After ignoring Sandy for\nmost of her pregnancy, Martin is present for Aaron's birth, as are both of\nAaron's grandfathers-to-be. Upon Aaron's birth Martin leaves Glenoak for\ncollege; he now lives near his son. This leaves Ruthie heartbroken, but by the\ntime Martin finally admits to her that he loves her, she is in love with new\nCamden houseguest T-Bone.
