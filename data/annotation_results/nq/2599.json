On\n28 April 1944, in south [Devon](/wiki/Devon \"Devon\") on the English coast, 749\nU.S. soldiers and sailors were killed when [German torpedo boats](/wiki/E-boat\n\"E-boat\") surprised one of these landing exercises, [Exercise\nTiger](/wiki/Exercise_Tiger \"Exercise Tiger\").[7]\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, the Allied forces conducted a\ndeception operation, [Operation Fortitude](/wiki/Operation_Fortitude\n\"Operation Fortitude\"), aimed at misleading the Germans with respect to the\ndate and place of the invasion.\n\nThere were several leaks prior to or on D-Day. Through the [Cicero\naffair](/wiki/Cicero_affair \"Cicero affair\"), the Germans obtained documents\ncontaining references to Overlord, but these documents lacked all detail.[8]\n[Double Cross](/wiki/Double_Cross_System \"Double Cross System\") agents, such\nas the Spaniard [Juan Pujol](/wiki/Juan_Pujol_Garc%C3%ADa \"Juan Pujol García\")\n(code-named Garbo), played an important role in convincing the German High\nCommand that Normandy was at best a diversionary attack. U.S. Major General\nHenry Miller, chief supply officer of the US 9th Air Force, during a party at\n[Claridge's](/wiki/Claridge%27s \"Claridge's\") Hotel in London complained to\nguests of the supply problems he was having but that after the invasion, which\nhe told them would be before 15 June, supply would be easier. After being\ntold, Eisenhower reduced Miller to lieutenant colonel [Associated Press, June\n10, 1944] and sent him back to the U.S. where he retired.[9] Another such leak\nwas General [Charles de Gaulle](/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle \"Charles de Gaulle\")'s\nradio message after D-Day. He, unlike all the other leaders, stated that this\ninvasion was the real invasion. This had the potential to ruin the Allied\ndeceptions Fortitude North and Fortitude South. In contrast, [Gen.\nEisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\") referred to the\nlandings as the initial invasion.\n\nOnly ten days each month were suitable for launching the operation: a day near\nthe [full moon](/wiki/Full_moon \"Full moon\") was needed both for illumination\nduring the hours of darkness and for the [spring\ntide](/wiki/Tide#Range_variation:_springs_and_neaps \"Tide\"), the former to\nilluminate navigational landmarks for the crews of aircraft, gliders and\nlanding craft, and the latter to expose defensive obstacles placed by the\nGerman forces in the surf on the seaward approaches to the beaches. A full\nmoon occurred on 6 June. [Allied Expeditionary Force Supreme\nCommander](/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force \"Supreme\nHeadquarters Allied Expeditionary Force\") Dwight D. Eisenhower had tentatively\nselected 5 June as the date for the assault. The weather was fine during most\nof May, but deteriorated in early June. On 4 June, conditions were clearly\nunsuitable for a landing; wind and high seas would make it impossible to\nlaunch landing craft from larger ships at sea, low clouds would prevent\naircraft finding their targets. The Allied troop convoys already at sea were\nforced to take shelter in bays and inlets on the south coast of Britain for\nthe night.\n\nIt seemed possible that everything would have to be cancelled and the troops\nreturned to their embarkation camps (which would be almost impossible, as the\nenormous movement of follow-up formations into them was already\nproceeding).[10] The next full moon period would be nearly a month away. At a\nvital meeting on 5 June, Eisenhower's chief meteorologist ([Group\nCaptain](/wiki/Group_Captain \"Group Captain\") [J.M. Stagg](/wiki/J.M._Stagg\n\"J.M. Stagg\")) forecast a brief improvement for 6 June.[11] Commander of all\nland forces for the invasion General Bernard Montgomery and Eisenhower's Chief\nof Staff General [Walter Bedell Smith](/wiki/Walter_Bedell_Smith \"Walter\nBedell Smith\") wished to proceed with the invasion. Commander of the Allied\nAir Forces [Air Chief Marshal](/wiki/Air_Chief_Marshal \"Air Chief Marshal\")\n[Leigh Mallory](/wiki/Trafford_Leigh_Mallory \"Trafford Leigh Mallory\") was\ndoubtful, but Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief [Admiral](/wiki/Admiral\n\"Admiral\") [Bertram Ramsay](/wiki/Bertram_Ramsay \"Bertram Ramsay\") believed\nthat conditions would be marginally favorable.[10] On the strength of Stagg's\nforecast, Eisenhower ordered the invasion to proceed.[12] As a result,\nprevailing overcast skies limited Allied air support, and no serious damage\nwould be done to the beach defences on Omaha and Juno.[13]\n\nThe Germans meanwhile took comfort from the existing poor conditions, which\nwere worse over Northern France than over the [English\nChannel](/wiki/English_Channel \"English Channel\") itself, and believed no\ninvasion would be possible for several days. Some troops stood down and many\nsenior officers were away for the weekend. Field Marshal [Erwin\nRommel](/wiki/Erwin_Rommel \"Erwin Rommel\") took a few days' leave to celebrate\nhis wife's birthday,[14] while dozens of division, regimental and battalion\ncommanders were away from their posts conducting war games just prior to the\ninvasion.[15]\n\n##\nCodenames[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Invasion_of_Normandy&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Codenames\")]\n\nThe Allies assigned codenames to the various operations involved in the\ninvasion. _Overlord_ was the name assigned to the establishment of a large-\nscale lodgement on the northern portion of the Continent. The first phase, the\nestablishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed _Neptune_. According to the\nD-day museum:\n\n    The armed forces use codenames to refer to the planning and execution of specific military operations. Operation Overlord was the codename for the Allied invasion of northwest Europe. The assault phase of Operation Overlord was known as Operation Neptune. (…) Operation Neptune began on D-Day (6 June 1944) and ended on 30 June 1944. By this time, the Allies had established a firm foothold in Normandy. Operation Overlord also began on D-Day, and continued until Allied forces crossed the [River Seine](/wiki/River_Seine \"River Seine\") on 19 August 1944.[16]\n\nOfficers with knowledge of D-Day were not to be sent where there was the\nslightest danger of being captured. These officers were given the codename of\n\"[Bigot](/wiki/BIGOT_list \"BIGOT list\")\", derived from the words \"To Gib\" (To\n[Gibraltar](/wiki/Gibraltar \"Gibraltar\")) that was stamped on the papers of\nofficers who took part in the [North African](/wiki/North_Africa \"North\nAfrica\") invasion in 1942.[17] On the night of 27 April, during [Exercise\nTiger](/wiki/Exercise_Tiger \"Exercise Tiger\"), a pre-invasion exercise off the\ncoast of [Slapton Sands](/wiki/Slapton,_Devon \"Slapton, Devon\") beach, several\nAmerican [LSTs](/wiki/Tank_Landing_Ship \"Tank Landing Ship\") were attacked by\nGerman [E boats](/wiki/E_boats \"E boats\") and among the 638 Americans killed\nin the attack and a further 308 killed by friendly fire, ten \"Bigots\" were\nlisted as missing.

Geyr argued for the standard\ndoctrine that the Panzer formations should be concentrated in a central\nposition around Paris and Rouen, and deployed _en masse_ against the main\nAllied beachhead when this had been identified.\n\nThe argument was eventually brought before Hitler for arbitration. He\ncharacteristically imposed an unworkable compromise solution. Only three\nPanzer divisions were given to Rommel, too few to cover all the threatened\nsectors. The remainder, nominally under Geyr's control, were actually\ndesignated as being in \"[OKW](/wiki/Oberkommando_der_Wehrmacht \"Oberkommando\nder Wehrmacht\") Reserve\". Only three of these were deployed close enough to\nintervene immediately against any invasion of Northern France; the other four\nwere dispersed in southern France and the Netherlands. Hitler reserved to\nhimself the authority to move the divisions in OKW Reserve, or commit them to\naction. On 6 June many Panzer division commanders were unable to move because\nHitler had not given the necessary authorisation, and his staff refused to\nwake him upon news of the invasion.\n\n#### Army Group B\nreserve[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Invasion_of_Normandy&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Army Group B reserve\")]\n\n  * [21st Panzer Division](/wiki/German_21st_Panzer_Division \"German 21st Panzer Division\") (Generalmajor [Edgar Feuchtinger](/wiki/Edgar_Feuchtinger \"Edgar Feuchtinger\")), was deployed near [Caen](/wiki/Caen \"Caen\") as a mobile striking force as part of the [Army Group B](/wiki/Army_Group_B \"Army Group B\") reserve. However, Rommel placed it so close to the coastal defenses that, under [standing orders](/wiki/General_order \"General order\") in case of invasion, several of its infantry and anti-aircraft units would come under the orders of the fortress divisions on the coast, reducing the effective strength of the division.\n\nThe other two armoured divisions over which Rommel had operational control,\nthe [2nd Panzer Division](/wiki/2nd_Panzer_Division_\\(Wehrmacht\\) \"2nd Panzer\nDivision \\(Wehrmacht\\)\") and [116th Panzer\nDivision](/wiki/116th_Panzer_Division_\\(Wehrmacht\\) \"116th Panzer Division\n\\(Wehrmacht\\)\"), were deployed near the Pas de Calais in accordance with\nGerman views about the likely Allied landing sites.

However, practically none of\nthese objectives had been achieved. It took six weeks for British and Canadian\ntroops to capture Caen, as they faced seven Panzer divisions, while their\nAmerican allies, although advancing more rapidly, faced only two of these\ndivisions. Overall the casualties had not been as heavy as some had feared\n(around 10,000 compared to the 20,000 Churchill had estimated) and the\nbridgeheads had withstood the expected counterattacks.\n\nOnce the beachhead was established, two artificial [Mulberry\nharbours](/wiki/Mulberry_harbour \"Mulberry harbour\") were towed across the\nEnglish Channel in segments and made operational around D+3 (9 June). One was\nconstructed at [Arromanches](/wiki/Arromanches \"Arromanches\") by British\nforces, the other at Omaha Beach by American forces. By 19 June, when severe\nstorms interrupted the landing of supplies for several days and destroyed the\nOmaha harbour, the British had landed 314,547 men, 54,000 vehicles, and\n102,000 tons of supplies, while the Americans put ashore 314,504 men, 41,000\nvehicles, and 116,000 tons of supplies.[29] Around 9,000 tons of\n[materiel](/wiki/Materiel \"Materiel\") were landed daily at the Arromanches\nharbour until the end of August 1944, by which time the port of\n[Cherbourg](/wiki/Cherbourg-Octeville \"Cherbourg-Octeville\") had been secured\nby the Allies and had begun to return to service.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn addition, with the installation of [PLUTO](/wiki/Operation_Pluto \"Operation\nPluto\") in August 1944 the Allies had fuel piped over directly from England\nwithout having to rely on vulnerable tankers.\n\n## Assessment of the\nbattle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Invasion_of_Normandy&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Assessment of the battle\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

They were\ncostly in terms of men, but the defeat inflicted on the Germans was one of the\nlargest of the war. Strategically, the campaign led to the loss of the German\nposition in most of France and the secure establishment of a new major front.\nIn larger context the Normandy landings helped the\n[Soviets](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") on the [Eastern\nFront](/wiki/Eastern_Front_\\(World_War_II\\) \"Eastern Front \\(World War II\\)\"),\nwho were facing the bulk of the German forces and, to a certain extent,\ncontributed to the shortening of the conflict there.\n\nAlthough there was a shortage of artillery ammunition, at no time were the\nAllies critically short of any necessity. This was a remarkable achievement\nconsidering they did not hold a port until Cherbourg fell. By the time of the\nbreakout the Allies also enjoyed a considerable superiority in numbers of\ntroops (approximately 7:2) and armoured vehicles (approximately 4:1) which\nhelped overcome the natural advantages the terrain gave to the German\ndefenders.\n\nAllied [intelligence and counterintelligence](/wiki/Espionage \"Espionage\")\nefforts were successful beyond expectations. The Operation Fortitude deception\nbefore the invasion kept German attention focused on the Pas de Calais, and\nindeed high-quality German forces were kept in this area, away from Normandy,\nuntil July. Prior to the invasion, few German reconnaissance flights took\nplace over Britain, and those that did saw only the dummy staging areas.\n[Ultra](/wiki/Ultra \"Ultra\") decrypts of German communications had been\nhelpful as well, exposing German dispositions and revealing their plans such\nas the [Mortain counterattack](/wiki/Operation_L%C3%BCttich \"Operation\nLüttich\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/The_British_Army_in_Normandy_1944_B6934.jpg/220px-\nThe_British_Army_in_Normandy_1944_B6934.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_British_Army_in_Normandy_1944_B6934.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_British_Army_in_Normandy_1944_B6934.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[General](/wiki/General_\\(United_Kingdom\\) \"General \\(United Kingdom\\)\")\n[Bernard\nMontgomery](/wiki/Bernard_Montgomery,_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein\n\"Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein\") with British troops\nin Normandy, July 1944\n\nAllied air operations also contributed significantly to the invasion, via\nclose tactical support, interdiction of German lines of communication\n(preventing timely movement of supplies and reinforcements—particularly the\ncritical Panzer units), and rendering the [Luftwaffe](/wiki/Luftwaffe\n\"Luftwaffe\") ineffective in Normandy.[nb 2] Although the impact upon armoured\nvehicles was less than expected, air activity intimidated these units and cut\ntheir supplies.\n\nDespite initial heavy losses in the assault phase, Allied morale remained\nhigh. Casualty rates among all the armies were tremendous, and the\nCommonwealth forces had to use a recently created category—Double Intense—to\nbe able to describe them.\n\n### German\nleadership[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Invasion_of_Normandy&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: German leadership\")]\n\nGerman commanders at all levels failed to react to the assault phase in a\ntimely manner. Communications problems exacerbated the difficulties caused by\nAllied air and naval firepower. Local commanders also seemed incapable of the\ntask of fighting an aggressive defense on the beach, as Rommel had envisioned.\n\nThe German High Command remained fixated on the Calais area, and von Rundstedt\nwas not permitted to commit the armoured reserve. When it was finally released\nlate in the day, its chance of success was greatly reduced. Overall, despite\nconsiderable Allied material superiority, the Germans kept the Allies bottled\nup in a small beachhead for nearly two months, aided immeasurably by terrain\nfactors.\n\nAlthough there were several known disputes among the Allied commanders, their\ntactics and strategy were essentially determined by agreement among the main\ncommanders. By contrast, the German leaders were bullied and their decisions\ninterfered with by OKW. Field Marshals von Rundstedt and Rommel repeatedly\nasked Hitler for more discretion but were refused. Rundstedt was removed from\nhis command on 29 June after he bluntly told the Chief of Staff at Hitler's\nArmed Forces HQ (Field Marshal [Keitel](/wiki/Wilhelm_Keitel \"Wilhelm\nKeitel\")) to \"Make peace, you idiots!\" Rommel was severely injured by Allied\naircraft on 17 July.\n\nSixty thousand of the 850,000 in Rundstedt's command were raised from the many\nprisoners of war taken on the Eastern Front.[30] Many surrendered or deserted\nat the first available opportunity.\n\n## War memorials and\ntourism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Invasion_of_Normandy&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: War memorials and tourism\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Beny-sur-\nMer_Cemetery.jpg/685px-Beny-sur-Mer_Cemetery.jpg)](/wiki/File:Beny-sur-\nMer_Cemetery.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Beny-sur-Mer_Cemetery.jpg \"File:Beny-sur-Mer Cemetery.jpg\")\n\nThe [Bény-sur-Mer Canadian War Cemetery](/wiki/B%C3%A9ny-sur-\nMer_Canadian_War_Cemetery \"Bény-sur-Mer Canadian War Cemetery\")\n\nThe beaches at Normandy are still referred to on maps and signposts by their\ninvasion codenames.
