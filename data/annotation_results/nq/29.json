Each series revolves around a team\nof youths recruited and trained by a mentor to morph into the eponymous Power\nRangers, able to utilize special powers and pilot immense assault machines,\ncalled Zords, to overcome the periodic antagonists. In the original series\n_Mighty Morphin_ , the wizard [Zordon](/wiki/Zordon \"Zordon\") recruits\n\"[teenagers](/wiki/Teenagers \"Teenagers\") with attitude\" against [Rita\nRepulsa](/wiki/Rita_Repulsa \"Rita Repulsa\").[4]\n\nWhen \"morphed,\" the rangers become powerful [superheroes](/wiki/Superhero\n\"Superhero\") wearing color-coded skin-tight [spandex](/wiki/Spandex \"Spandex\")\nsuits and helmets with [opaque](/wiki/Opacity_\\(optics\\) \"Opacity \\(optics\\)\")\n[visors](/wiki/Visor \"Visor\"); identical except in individual rangers' color\nand helmet design. Morphed Rangers generally possess enhanced strength,\ndurability, agility and combat prowess. Some possess superhuman or\n[psychic](/wiki/Psychic \"Psychic\") abilities such as super-speed, element\nmanipulation, [extra-sensory perception](/wiki/Extra-sensory_perception\n\"Extra-sensory perception\") or [invisibility](/wiki/Invisibility\n\"Invisibility\").[5] In addition, each individual ranger has a unique\n[weapon](/wiki/Weapon \"Weapon\"), as well as common weaponry used for ground\nfighting.[note 1] When enemies grow to incredible size (as nearly all do),\nRangers utilize individual Zords that combine into a larger Megazord.\n\nRangers teams operate in teams of five or three, with more Rangers joining the\nteam later. Each team of Rangers, with a few exceptions, obeys a general set\nof conventions, outlined at the beginning of _Mighty Morphin_ and implied by\nmentors throughout many of the other series: Power Rangers may not use their\nRanger powers for personal gain or for escalating a fight (unless the enemy\ndoes so), nor may the Power Rangers disclose their identities to the general\npublic.[note 2] The penalty for disobeying these rules, in _[Mighty Morphin\nPower Rangers](/wiki/Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers \"Mighty Morphin Power\nRangers\")_ , is the loss of their power.\n\nAs in _Super Sentai_ , the color palette of each _Power Rangers_ team changes\nevery series.[note 3] Only Red and Blue appear in every Ranger team, while a\nYellow Ranger has been present in every season except _[Power Rangers Dino\nCharge](/wiki/Power_Rangers_Dino_Charge \"Power Rangers Dino Charge\")_. Other\ncolors and designations also appear throughout the series.[note 4] A Rangers'\ncolor designation also influences their wardrobe throughout the series:\ncivilian clothing often matches Ranger color.[note 5]\n\n## History\n\n### Adapting the _Super Sentai_ series\n\n[![\\[icon\\]](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg) |  **This section needs expansion**. You can help by [adding to it](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Power_Rangers&action=edit&section=). _(October 2009)_  \n---|---  \n  \nProduction of _Power Rangers_ episodes involves extensive localization of and\nrevision of original _Super Sentai_ source material in order to incorporate\nAmerican culture and conform to American television standards. Rather than\nmaking an English [dub](/wiki/Dubbing_\\(filmmaking\\) \"Dubbing \\(filmmaking\\)\")\nor [translation](/wiki/Translation \"Translation\") of the Japanese footage,\n_Power Rangers_ programs consist of scenes featuring [English-\nspeaking](/wiki/English_Language \"English Language\") actors (either from the\n[United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), [Canada](/wiki/Canada\n\"Canada\"), [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"), [New\nZealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\"), or the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\")) spliced with scenes featuring\neither Japanese actors dubbed into English or the action scenes from the Super\nSentai Series featuring the Rangers fighting [monsters](/wiki/Kaiju \"Kaiju\")\nor the [giant robot](/wiki/Mecha \"Mecha\") (Zord and Megazord) battles with\nEnglish dubbing. In some series, original fight scenes are filmed to\nincorporate characters or items unique to the _Power Rangers_ production.[6]\nLike many of [Saban Entertainment](/wiki/Saban_Entertainment \"Saban\nEntertainment\") previous ventures in [localizing](/wiki/Language_localisation\n\"Language localisation\") Japanese television for a\n[Western](/wiki/Western_culture \"Western culture\") audience, the plot,\ncharacter names, and other names usually differ greatly from the source\nfootage, though a few seasons have stayed close to the story of the original\nSuper Sentai season.\n\nAlong with adapting the villains from the Super Sentai counterparts, most\n_Power Rangers_ series also feature villains with no Sentai counterpart.\nGenerally, the primary antagonist of a _Power Rangers_ series (for example,\nLord Zedd, Divatox, etc.) are not adapted from the Sentai. Exceptions to this\nincludes _Mighty Morphin_ , _Zeo_ , _Lightspeed Rescue_ and a few others which\nonly use villains adapted from the Japanese shows.\n\nThe series that began the [franchise](/wiki/Media_franchise \"Media\nfranchise\"), _[Mighty Morphin Power\nRangers](/wiki/Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\")_\n(an American adaptation of the 1992 Japanese [Super Sentai](/wiki/Super_Sentai\n\"Super Sentai\") Series, _[Kyōryū Sentai\nZyuranger](/wiki/Ky%C5%8Dry%C5%AB_Sentai_Zyuranger \"Kyōryū Sentai\nZyuranger\")_), began broadcasting as part of the [Fox Kids](/wiki/Fox_Kids\n\"Fox Kids\") block of programing that aired on the\n[FOX](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting Company\") network. It\nlasted for three seasons (from 1993 to 1996).[7]\n\n### Broadcast history\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/Power_rangers.png/250px-\nPower_rangers.png)](/wiki/File:Power_rangers.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Power_rangers.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Saban Entertainment run of the franchise—beginning with _[Power Rangers in\nSpace](/wiki/Power_Rangers_in_Space \"Power Rangers in Space\")_ —used this\nversion of the _Power Rangers_ logo (1998–2001).\n\n[Saban Entertainment](/wiki/Saban_Entertainment \"Saban Entertainment\")\ndistributed the _Power Rangers_ series from 1993 until the end of 2001, and\nFox broadcast it until the [fall](/wiki/Autumn \"Autumn\") of 2002. [The Walt\nDisney Company](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company \"The Walt Disney Company\")\npurchased the franchise as part of a buyout that took place in\n2001.[7][8][9][10] This resulted in Fox Family Worldwide becoming [ABC Family\nWorldwide Inc.](/wiki/ABC_Family_Worldwide_Inc. \"ABC Family Worldwide\nInc.\")[10] This buyout also saw Saban Entertainment becoming BVS Entertainment\nin 2002, from [News Corporation](/wiki/News_Corporation \"News Corporation\"),\nFox's parent company, and [Haim Saban](/wiki/Haim_Saban \"Haim Saban\").[10] The\nshow continued to air on Fox until the company replaced its [Fox\nKids](/wiki/Fox_Kids \"Fox Kids\") package with \"FoxBox\" in the United States.\nSince September 2002, all _Power Rangers_ shows had aired on various Disney-\nowned networks ([ABC Kids](/wiki/ABC_Kids_\\(United_States\\) \"ABC Kids \\(United\nStates\\)\"), [Toon Disney](/wiki/Toon_Disney \"Toon Disney\") and\n[Jetix](/wiki/Jetix \"Jetix\") channels worldwide).[7] When _[Wild\nForce](/wiki/Power_Rangers_Wild_Force \"Power Rangers Wild Force\")_ ended,\nDisney moved production of the franchise from Los Angeles to New Zealand. This\nresulted in the closure of MMPR Productions and the dismissal of many members\nof the production. From _[Ninja Storm](/wiki/Power_Rangers_Ninja_Storm \"Power\nRangers Ninja Storm\")_ to date, _Power Rangers_ is produced in New Zealand.\nABC Family, another Disney-owned network, also used to air _Power Rangers_\nuntil it did away with its Jetix timeslot after August 31, 2006. On February\n12, 2009, Toon Disney ended in the wake of [Disney XD](/wiki/Disney_XD \"Disney\nXD\"), ending cable airings of _Power Rangers_ in certain areas of the United\nStates. Several ABC affiliate broadcasting groups declined to air most of the\n_Power Rangers_ series since 2006 due to the lack of FCC-compliant\n[educational and informational content](/wiki/E/I \"E/I\") in the programs.[11]\n\nThe Saban era seasons, starting with _In Space_ , have gone under the \"Saban's\nPower Rangers\" moniker, up until _Time Force_. Since the re-acquisition of\n_Power Rangers_ by Saban in 2010, this practice has continued once again\nstarting with _Samurai_.\n\nStarting in 2005, up until 2007, during its run on Jetix, _Power Rangers_\nreruns were aired under the moniker _Power Rangers Generations_ , showcasing\nselect episodes from _Mighty Morphin_ through _Dino Thunder_.\n\nAn article in _[The New Zealand Herald](/wiki/The_New_Zealand_Herald \"The New\nZealand Herald\")_ published on March 7, 2009, identified _[Power Rangers\nRPM](/wiki/Power_Rangers_RPM \"Power Rangers RPM\")_ as the last season of the\n_Power Rangers_ run.

In many series, a Ranger is also given additional Zords or weapons. In some cases, one Ranger may receive something that other Rangers do not; an example is the [Battlizer](/wiki/Battlizer \"Battlizer\") given to the Red Ranger of each series since _[Power Rangers in Space](/wiki/Power_Rangers_in_Space \"Power Rangers in Space\")_ (until _[Operation Overdrive](/wiki/Power_Rangers_Operation_Overdrive \"Power Rangers Operation Overdrive\")_).\n  2. **Jump up ^** Public servants (rescue squad, police officers, etc.) appearing as Rangers disregard this convention in _[Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue](/wiki/Power_Rangers_Lightspeed_Rescue \"Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue\")_ , _[Power Rangers S.P.D.](/wiki/Power_Rangers_S.P.D. \"Power Rangers S.P.D.\")_ , _[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive](/wiki/Power_Rangers_Operation_Overdrive \"Power Rangers Operation Overdrive\")_ and _[Power Rangers RPM](/wiki/Power_Rangers_RPM \"Power Rangers RPM\")_.\n  3. **Jump up ^** An original Power Ranger, the [Titanium Ranger](/wiki/Titanium_Ranger \"Titanium Ranger\"), was created especially for _Lightspeed Rescue_ to add a sixth Power Ranger to the series.\n  4. **Jump up ^** Other color designations include [metallic](/wiki/Metal \"Metal\") colors, violet, and \"Shadow\", as well as protagonists who have powers and costumes similar to those of the Rangers but are not called \"Power Rangers\", such as the [Blue Senturion](/wiki/Blue_Senturion \"Blue Senturion\") and [Koragg the Knight Wolf](/wiki/Koragg_the_Knight_Wolf \"Koragg the Knight Wolf\").\n  5. **Jump up ^** A joke highlighted this correlation in _Dino Thunder_ when [Tommy Oliver](/wiki/Tommy_Oliver \"Tommy Oliver\") (a former Green Ranger, White Ranger, and Red Ranger) became the new Black Ranger; he said that he had to go shopping because he did not own enough black-colored clothing.\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Toei Company Profile| Toei\"](http://www.toei.co.jp/en/company/license.html).
