Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman Empire\"). After the fall of the\n[Roman Republic](/wiki/Roman_Republic \"Roman Republic\"), the constitutional\nbalance of power shifted from the \"[Roman Senate](/wiki/Roman_Senate \"Roman\nSenate\")\" to the \"[Roman Emperor](/wiki/Roman_emperor \"Roman emperor\").\"\nBeginning with the first emperor, [Augustus](/wiki/Augustus \"Augustus\"), the\nEmperor and the Senate were technically two co-equal branches of government.\nIn practice, however the actual authority of the imperial Senate was\nnegligible, as the Emperor held the true power of the state. As such,\nmembership in the Senate became sought after by individuals seeking prestige\nand social standing, rather than actual authority. During the reigns of the\nfirst Emperors, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers were all\ntransferred from the \"[Roman assemblies](/wiki/Roman_assemblies \"Roman\nassemblies\")\" to the Senate. However, since the control that the Emperor held\nover the senate was absolute, the Senate acted as a vehicle through which the\nEmperor exercised his autocratic powers.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Procedure\n  * 2 Powers\n  * 3 Post-Imperial period\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 Notes\n  * 7 Further reading\n    * 7.1 Primary sources\n    * 7.2 Secondary source material\n\n##\nProcedure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Senate_of_the_Roman_Empire&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Procedure\")]\n\nThe first emperor, Augustus, inherited a Senate whose membership had been\nincreased to 900 senators by his adoptive father, Julius Caesar. Augustus\nsought to reduce the size of the Senate, and did so through three revisions to\nthe list of senators.[1] By the time that these revisions had been completed,\nthe Senate had been reduced to 600 members, and after this point, the size of\nthe Senate was never again drastically altered. To reduce the size of the\nsenate, Augustus expelled senators who were of low birth,[1] and then he\nreformed the rules which specified how an individual could become a senator.\nUnder Augustus' reforms, a senator had to be a citizen of free birth, have not\nbeen convicted of any crimes under _lex Julia de vi privata_ , and have\nproperty worth at least 1,000,000 [sesterces](/wiki/Sesterce \"Sesterce\").[2]\n\nUnder the Empire, as was the case during the late Republic, one could become a\nsenator by being elected [quaestor](/wiki/Quaestor \"Quaestor\"). Under the\nEmpire, however, one could only stand for election to the\n[Quaestorship](/wiki/Quaestor \"Quaestor\") if one was of senatorial rank, and\nto be of senatorial rank, one had to be the son of a senator.[1] If an\nindividual was not of senatorial rank, there were two ways for that individual\nto become a senator. Under the first method, the Emperor granted that\nindividual the authority to stand for election to the Quaestorship,[1] while\nunder the second method, the Emperor appointed that individual to the senate\nby issuing a decree (the _adlectio_).[3]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Curia_Iulia.JPG/220px-\nCuria_Iulia.JPG)](/wiki/File:Curia_Iulia.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Curia_Iulia.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Curia Julia](/wiki/Curia_Julia \"Curia Julia\") in the [Roman\nForum](/wiki/Roman_Forum \"Roman Forum\"), the seat of the imperial Senate\n\nBeginning in 9 BC, with the passage of Augustus' _lex Julia de senatu habendo_\n,[2] an official list of senators (the _album senatorium_) was maintained and\nrevised each year. Individuals were added to the list if they had recently\nsatisfied the requirements for entry into the Senate, and were removed from\nthe list if they no longer satisfied the requirements necessary to maintain\nsenate membership.[3] The list named each senator by order of rank.[3] The\nEmperor always outranked all of his fellow senators, and was followed by\n\"[Consuls](/wiki/Roman_consul \"Roman consul\")\" (the highest ranking\nmagistrate) and former Consuls, then by \"[Praetors](/wiki/Praetor \"Praetor\")\"\n(the next highest ranking magistrate) and former Praetors, and so on. A\nsenator's tenure in elective office was considered when determining rank,\nwhile senators who had been elected to an office did not necessarily outrank\nsenators who had been appointed to that same office by the Emperor[3]\n\nMembers of the senatorial order were distinguished by a broad reddish-purple\nstripe edging their [togas](/wiki/Togas \"Togas\") – the formal dress of all\nRoman citizens.\n\nUnder the Empire, the power that the Emperor held over the Senate was\nabsolute, which was due, in part, to the fact that the Emperor held office for\nlife.[4] During senate meetings, the Emperor sat between the two Consuls,[5]\nand usually acted as the presiding officer. Senators of the early Empire could\nask extraneous questions or request that a certain action be taken by the\nSenate. Higher ranking senators spoke before lower ranking senators, although\nthe Emperor could speak at any time.[5] Besides the Emperor, Consuls and\nPraetors could also preside over the senate.\n\nThe Senate ordinarily met in the _[Curia Julia](/wiki/Curia_Julia \"Curia\nJulia\")_ , usually on either the [Kalends](/wiki/Kalends \"Kalends\") (the first\nday of the month), or the [Ides](/wiki/Ides_\\(calendar\\) \"Ides \\(calendar\\)\")\n(around the fifteenth day of the month), although scheduled meetings occurred\nmore frequently in September and October. Other meetings were held on an _[ad\nhoc](/wiki/Ad_hoc \"Ad hoc\")_ basis.[3] Under Augustus, a [quorum](/wiki/Quorum\n\"Quorum\") was set at 400 senators, although eventually excessive absenteeism\nforced the senate to lower the number of senators necessary for a quorum, and,\non some matters, to revoke the quorum rules altogether.[5]\n\nMost of the bills that came before the Senate were presented by the Emperor or\nhis supporters in the body. In the early principate, Augustus and Tiberius\nmade conscious efforts to hide their influence on the body, lobbying in\nprivate instead of directly proposing legislation.[2] Since no senator could\nstand for election to a magisterial office without the Emperor's approval,\nsenators usually did not vote against bills that had been presented by the\nEmperor.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] If a senator disapproved of a bill, he usually\nshowed his disapproval by not attending the Senate meeting on the day that the\nbill was to be voted on.[6] Each Emperor selected a _quaestor_ to compile the\nproceedings of the Senate into a document (the _acta senatus_), which included\nproposed bills, official documents, and a summary of speeches that had been\npresented before the Senate. The document was archived, while parts of it were\npublished (in a document called the _[acta diurna](/wiki/Acta_diurna \"Acta\ndiurna\")_ or \"daily doings\") and then distributed to the public.[6]\n\n##\nPowers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Senate_of_the_Roman_Empire&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Powers\")]\n\nWhile the [Roman assemblies](/wiki/Roman_assemblies \"Roman assemblies\")\ncontinued to meet after the founding of the Empire, their powers were all\ntransferred to the Senate, and so senatorial decrees (_senatus consulta_)\nacquired the full force of law.[4] The legislative powers of the Imperial\nSenate were principally of a financial and an administrative nature, although\nthe senate did retain a range of powers over the provinces.[4] The Senate\ncould also regulate festivals and religious cults, grant special honors,\nexcuse an individual (usually the Emperor) from legal liability, manage\ntemples and public games, and even enact tax laws (but only with the\nacquiescence of the Emperor).[4] However, it had no real authority over either\nthe state religion or over public lands.\n\nDuring the early Roman Empire, all judicial powers that had been held by the\nRoman assemblies were also transferred to the Senate. For example, the senate\nnow held jurisdiction over criminal trials. In these cases, a _consul_\npresided, the senators constituted the jury, and the verdict was handed down\nin the form of a decree (_senatus consultum_),[4][7] and, while a verdict\ncould not be appealed, the Emperor could pardon a convicted individual through\na veto. Each province that was under the jurisdiction of the Senate had its\nown court, and, upon the recommendation of a consul, decisions of these\nprovincial courts could be appealed to the Senate.[7]\n\nIn theory, the Senate elected new emperors, while in conjunction with the\npopular assemblies, it would then confer upon the new emperor his command\npowers (_[imperium](/wiki/Imperium \"Imperium\")_).[7] After an emperor had died\nor abdicated his office, the Senate would often deify him, although sometimes\nit would pass a decree (_[damnatio memoriae](/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae \"Damnatio\nmemoriae\")_ or \"damnation from memory\") which would attempt to cancel every\ntrace of that emperor from the life of Rome, as if he had never existed.[7]\nThe emperor [Tiberius](/wiki/Tiberius \"Tiberius\") transferred all electoral\npowers from the assemblies to the Senate,[7] and, while theoretically the\nSenate elected new magistrates, the approval of the Emperor was always needed\nbefore an election could be finalized. Despite this fact, however, elections\nremained highly contested and vigorously fought.[7]\n\nUnder [Vespasian](/wiki/Vespasian \"Vespasian\") (69-79 AD) senators were\naccorded an increased role as senior officials of the Imperial household in\nRome or as provincial rulers directly representing the emperor. At the same\ntime, members of the [Equestrian order](/wiki/Equestrian_order \"Equestrian\norder\") were employed in administrative positions that earlier emperors had\nreserved for freedmen. In the case of the Senate this expanded responsibility\nensured an increased opportunity for providing advice and exercising\nauthority. At the end of the [Flavian dynasty](/wiki/Flavian_dynasty \"Flavian\ndynasty\") the Senate was able to choose [Nerva](/wiki/Nerva \"Nerva\") as the\nnew emperor – the first time under the Empire that such an initiative had been\npossible.[8] However, after the death of [Marcus\nAurelius](/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius \"Marcus Aurelius\"), the Senate became\nincreasingly irrelevant, as Emperors become more hostile to its members and\nless frequently consulted it.[2] By the Severan dynasty, the Senatorial class\nwas also increasingly separated from the actual operations of government,\nwhich were increasingly taken over by equestrians and other members of the\nImperial bureaucracy.[2]\n\nAround 300 AD, the Emperor [Diocletian](/wiki/Diocletian \"Diocletian\") enacted\na series of constitutional reforms. In one such reform, Diocletian asserted\nthe right of the Emperor to take power without the theoretical consent of the\nSenate, thus depriving the Senate of its status as the ultimate depository of\nsupreme power. Diocletian's reforms also ended whatever illusion had remained\nthat the Senate had independent legislative, judicial, or electoral powers.\nThe Senate did, however, retain its legislative powers over public games in\nRome, and over the senatorial order. The Senate also retained the power to try\ntreason cases, and to elect some magistrates, but only with the permission of\nthe Emperor. In the final years of the Empire, the Senate would sometimes try\nto appoint their own emperor, such as in case of [Eugenius](/wiki/Eugenius\n\"Eugenius\") who was later defeated by forces loyal to [Theodosius\nI](/wiki/Theodosius_I \"Theodosius I\"). The Senate remained the last stronghold\nof the traditional Roman religion in the face of the spreading Christianity,\nand several times attempted to facilitate the return of the [Altar of\nVictory](/wiki/Altar_of_Victory \"Altar of Victory\"), first removed by\n[Constantius II](/wiki/Constantius_II \"Constantius II\"), to the senatorial\ncuria.\n\n## Post-Imperial\nperiod[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Senate_of_the_Roman_Empire&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Post-Imperial period\")]\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Senate continued to function\nunder the barbarian chieftain [Odoacer](/wiki/Odoacer \"Odoacer\"), and then\nunder [Theoderic the Great](/wiki/Theoderic_the_Great \"Theoderic the Great\")\nwho founded the [Ostrogothic Kingdom](/wiki/Ostrogothic_Kingdom \"Ostrogothic\nKingdom\"). The authority of the Senate rose considerably under barbarian\nleaders who sought to protect the institution. This period was characterized\nby the rise of prominent Roman senatorial families such as the Anicii, while\nthe Senate's leader, the [princeps senatus](/wiki/Princeps_senatus \"Princeps\nsenatus\"), often served as the right hand of the barbarian leader. It is known\nthat the Senate installed [Laurentius](/wiki/Antipope_Laurentius \"Antipope\nLaurentius\") as antipope in 498 despite the fact that both King Theodoric and\nEmperor Anastasius supported [Pope Symmachus](/wiki/Pope_Symmachus \"Pope\nSymmachus\").\n\nThe peaceful co-existence of senatorial and barbarian rule continued until the\nOstrogothic leader [Theodahad](/wiki/Theodahad \"Theodahad\") began an uprising\nagainst Emperor [Justinian I](/wiki/Justinian_I \"Justinian I\") and took the\nsenators as hostages. Several senators were executed in 552 as a revenge for\nthe death of the Ostrogothic king [Totila](/wiki/Totila \"Totila\"). After Rome\nwas recaptured by the Imperial ([Byzantine](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire \"Byzantine\nEmpire\")) army, the Senate was restored, but the institution (like classical\nRome itself) had been mortally weakened by the long war between the Byzantines\nand the Ostrogoths. Many senators had been killed and many of those who had\nfled to the East chose to remain there thanks to favorable legislation passed\nby emperor Justinian, who however abolished virtually all senatorial offices\nin Italy. The importance of the Roman Senate thus declined rapidly. In 578 and\nagain in 580, the Senate sent envoys to Constantinople who delivered 3000\npounds of gold as a gift to the new emperor [Tiberius II\nConstantinus](/wiki/Tiberius_II_Constantinus \"Tiberius II Constantinus\") along\nwith a plea for help against the [Langobards](/wiki/Langobards \"Langobards\")\nwho had invaded Italy ten years earlier. [Pope Gregory I](/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I\n\"Pope Gregory I\"), in a sermon from 593 (Senatus deest, or.18), lamented the\nalmost complete disappearance of the senatorial order and the decline of the\nprestigious institution. It is not clearly known when the Roman Senate\ndisappeared in the West, but it is known from Gregorian register that the\nSenate acclaimed new statues of Emperor [Phocas](/wiki/Phocas \"Phocas\") and\nEmpress [Leontia](/wiki/Leontia \"Leontia\") in 603.[9] The institution must\nhave vanished by 630 when the Curia was transformed into a church by [Pope\nHonorius I](/wiki/Pope_Honorius_I \"Pope Honorius I\"). The Senate did continue\nto exist in the [Eastern Roman Empire](/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire \"Eastern\nRoman Empire\")'s capital [Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople\n\"Constantinople\"), however, having been instituted there during the reign of\n[Constantine I](/wiki/Constantine_I \"Constantine I\"). The Byzantine Senate\nsurvived until at least the mid-14th century, before the ancient institution\nfinally vanished from history.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Senate_of_the_Roman_Empire&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Roman Kingdom](/wiki/Roman_Kingdom \"Roman Kingdom\")\n  * [Roman Republic](/wiki/Roman_Republic \"Roman Republic\")\n  * [Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman Empire\")\n  * [Roman Law](/wiki/Roman_Law \"Roman Law\")\n  * [Plebeian Council](/wiki/Plebeian_Council \"Plebeian Council\")\n  * [Centuria](/wiki/Centuria \"Centuria\")\n\n|  | \n\n  * [Curia](/wiki/Curia \"Curia\")\n  * [Roman consul](/wiki/Roman_consul \"Roman consul\")\n  * [Praetor](/wiki/Praetor \"Praetor\")\n  * [Roman censor](/wiki/Roman_censor \"Roman censor\")\n  * [Quaestor](/wiki/Quaestor \"Quaestor\")\n  * [Aedile](/wiki/Aedile \"Aedile\")\n\n|  | \n\n  * [Roman Dictator](/wiki/Roman_Dictator \"Roman Dictator\")\n  * [Master of the Horse](/wiki/Master_of_the_Horse \"Master of the Horse\")\n  * [Roman Senate](/wiki/Roman_Senate \"Roman Senate\")\n  * [Cursus honorum](/wiki/Cursus_honorum \"Cursus honorum\")\n  * [Byzantine Senate](/wiki/Byzantine_Senate \"Byzantine Senate\")\n  * [Pontifex Maximus](/wiki/Pontifex_Maximus \"Pontifex Maximus\")\n\n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Senate_of_the_Roman_Empire&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  * Abbott, Frank Frost (1901). _A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions_.
