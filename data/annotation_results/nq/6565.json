There are no\nprecise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and\nresearchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the\nmid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years. Millennials are sometimes\nreferred to as \"echo boomers\" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s\nand 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the [baby\nboomers](/wiki/Baby_boomers \"Baby boomers\"). The 20th-century trend toward\nsmaller families in developed countries continued, however, so the relative\nimpact of the \"baby boom echo\" was generally less pronounced than the\n[post–World War II baby boom](/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_baby_boom\n\"Post–World War II baby boom\").\n\nAlthough Millennial characteristics vary by region, depending on social and\neconomic conditions, the [generation](/wiki/Generation \"Generation\") is\ngenerally marked by an increased use and familiarity with communications,\nmedia, and digital technologies.[1] In most parts of the world, their\nupbringing was marked by an increase in a liberal approach to politics and\neconomics; the effects of this environment are disputed. The [Great\nRecession](/wiki/Great_Recession \"Great Recession\") has had a major impact on\nthis generation because it has caused historically high levels of unemployment\namong young people, and has led to speculation about possible long-term\neconomic and social damage to this generation.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Terminology\n  * 2 Date and age range definitions\n  * 3 Traits\n  * 4 Workplace attitudes\n  * 5 Political views\n    * 5.1 Political correctness\n  * 6 Demographics in the United States\n  * 7 Economic prospects\n  * 8 Peter Pan generation\n  * 9 Religion\n  * 10 Digital technology\n  * 11 Cultural identity\n  * 12 See also\n  * 13 References\n  * 14 Further reading\n\n## Terminology\n\nAuthors [William Strauss](/wiki/William_Strauss \"William Strauss\") and [Neil\nHowe](/wiki/Neil_Howe \"Neil Howe\") are widely credited with naming the\nmillennials.[2] They coined the term in 1987, around the time children born in\n1982 were entering preschool, and the media were first identifying their\nprospective link to the new [millennium](/wiki/Millennium \"Millennium\") as the\nhigh school graduating class of 2000.[3] They wrote about the cohort in their\nbooks _Generations: The History of America 's Future, 1584 to 2069_ (1991)[4]\nand _Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation_ (2000).[3]\n\nIn August 1993, an _[Advertising Age](/wiki/Advertising_Age \"Advertising\nAge\")_ editorial coined the phrase _Generation Y_ to describe those who were\naged 11 or younger as well as the teenagers of the upcoming ten years who were\ndefined as different from [Generation X](/wiki/Generation_X \"Generation\nX\").[5][6] According to journalist Bruce Horovitz, in 2012, _Ad Age_ \"threw in\nthe towel by conceding that millennials is a better name than Gen Y\",[2] and\nby 2014, a past director of data strategy at _Ad Age_ said to NPR \"the\nGeneration Y label was a placeholder until we found out more about them\".[7]\nMillennials are sometimes called _Echo Boomers_ ,[8] due to their being the\noffspring of the baby boomers and due to the significant increase in birth\nrates from the early 1980s to mid 1990s, mirroring that of their parents. In\nthe United States, [birth rates](/wiki/Birth_rates \"Birth rates\") peaked in\nAugust 1990[9][10] and a 20th-century trend toward smaller families in\ndeveloped countries continued.[11][12] In his book _The Lucky Few: Between\nthe[Greatest Generation](/wiki/Greatest_Generation \"Greatest Generation\") and\nthe Baby Boom_, author Elwood Carlson called this cohort the \"New\nBoomers\".[13]\n\n[Psychologist](/wiki/Psychologist \"Psychologist\") [Jean\nTwenge](/wiki/Jean_Twenge \"Jean Twenge\") described millennials as \"Generation\nMe\" in her 2006 book _Generation Me: Why Today’s Young Americans Are More\nConfident, Assertive, Entitled—and More Miserable Than Ever Before_ , which\nwas updated in 2014.[14][15] In 2013, _[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine ran a [cover\nstory](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cover_story \"wikt:cover story\") titled\n_Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation_.[16] _[Newsweek](/wiki/Newsweek\n\"Newsweek\")_ used the term _Generation 9/11_ to refer to young people who were\nbetween the ages of 10 and 20 years during the [terrorist acts of 11 September\n2001](/wiki/September_11_attacks \"September 11 attacks\"). The first reference\nto \"Generation 9/11\" was made in the cover story of the 12 November 2001 issue\nof _[Newsweek](/wiki/Newsweek \"Newsweek\")_.[17] Alternative names for this\ngroup proposed include _Generation We_ ,[18] _Global Generation_ , _Generation\nNext_[19] and the _Net Generation_.[20]\n\nChinese millennials are commonly called the 1980s and 1990s\n[generations](/wiki/Generations \"Generations\"). At a 2015 conference in\nShanghai organized by [University of Southern\nCalifornia](/wiki/University_of_Southern_California \"University of Southern\nCalifornia\")'s US-China Institute, millennials in China were examined and\ncontrasted with American millennials[21] Findings included millennials'\nmarriage, childbearing, and child raising preferences, life and career\nambitions, and attitudes towards volunteerism and activism.[22]\n\n## Date and age range definitions\n\nA minority of demographers and researchers start the generation in the mid-to-\nlate 1970s, such as [Synchrony Financial](/wiki/Synchrony_Financial \"Synchrony\nFinancial\") which describes millennials as starting as early as 1976 and\nending at 1992,[23][24] [Mobilize.org](/wiki/Mobilize.org \"Mobilize.org\")\nwhich uses 1976–1996,[25] [MetLife](/wiki/MetLife \"MetLife\") which uses birth\ndates ranging 1977–1994,[26] and [Nielsen Media\nResearch](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings \"Nielsen ratings\") which uses\n1977–1995.[27][28]\n\nA majority of researchers and demographers start the generation in the early\n1980s, with many ending the generation in the mid and late 1990s.\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\")'s McCrindle Research[29] regards\n1980–1994 as Generation Y birth years. A 2013\n[PricewaterhouseCoopers](/wiki/PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\"PricewaterhouseCoopers\")[30] report and Edelman Berland[31] use 1980–1995.\n[Gallup Inc.](/wiki/Gallup_\\(company\\) \"Gallup \\(company\\)\"),[32][33][34]\n[Eventbrite](/wiki/Eventbrite \"Eventbrite\")[35][36] and [Dale Carnegie\nTraining and MSW Research](/wiki/Dale_Carnegie \"Dale Carnegie\")[37] all use\n1980–1996. [Ernst and Young](/wiki/Ernst_%26_Young \"Ernst & Young\") uses\n1981–1996.[38]\n\nAnother majority end the generation in the late 1990s or early 2000s. A 2017\n[viral video](/wiki/Viral_video \"Viral video\") from [BuzzFeed](/wiki/BuzzFeed\n\"BuzzFeed\"), detailing the seven living generations of Americans, described\nmillennials as those born between 1981–1997.[39] On the American television\nprogram _[Survivor](/wiki/Survivor_\\(U.S._TV_series\\) \"Survivor \\(U.S. TV\nseries\\)\")_ , for their 33rd season, subtitled _[Millennials vs. Gen\nX](/wiki/Survivor:_Millennials_vs._Gen_X \"Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X\")_ ,\nthe \"Millennial tribe\" consisted of individuals born between 1984 and\n1997.[40] [Goldman Sachs](/wiki/Goldman_Sachs \"Goldman Sachs\"),[41]\n[Resolution Foundation](/wiki/Resolution_Foundation \"Resolution\nFoundation\"),[42][43] and a 2013 _[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine [cover\nstory](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cover_story \"wikt:cover story\")[44] all\nuse 1980–2000. Millennialpolicycenter.org and SYZYGY, a digital service agency\npartially owned by [WPP](/wiki/WPP_plc \"WPP plc\"), uses 1981–1998.[45][46][47]\nThe [United States Census Bureau](/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau \"United\nStates Census Bureau\") uses 1982–2000.[48] [Pew Research\nCenter](/wiki/Pew_Research_Center \"Pew Research Center\") defines millennials\nas being born from 1981 to about 1997, with no chronological end point firmly\nestablished.[49][50] Career[FAQ](/wiki/FAQ \"FAQ\") uses years between\n1982-2000.[51]\n\nDemographers [William Straus and Neil\nHowe](/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory \"Strauss–Howe\ngenerational theory\") define millennials as born between 1982–2004.[2]\nHowever, Howe described the dividing line between millennials and the\nfollowing [Generation Z](/wiki/Generation_Z \"Generation Z\") as \"tentative\",\nsaying \"you can’t be sure where history will someday draw a cohort dividing\nline until a generation fully comes of age\". He noted that the millennials'\nrange beginning in 1982 would point to the next generation's window starting\nbetween 2000 and 2006.[52]\n\nIn his 2008 book _The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby\nBoom_ , author Elwood Carlson defined this cohort as born between 1983–2001\nbased on the upswing in births after 1983 and finishing with the \"political\nand social challenges\" that occurred after the [September 11 terrorist\nacts](/wiki/September_11_attacks \"September 11 attacks\").[13] In 2016, [U.S\nPirg](/wiki/Public_Interest_Research_Group \"Public Interest Research Group\")\ndescribed millennials as those born between 1983 and 2000.[53][54][55]\n\nDue to birth-year overlap between definitions of Generation X and millennials,\nand the tentative nature of generations, some individuals born in the late\n1970s and early 1980s see themselves as being \"between\" the two\ngenerations.[56][57][58][59] Names given to those born in the Generation X and\nMillennial [cusp](/wiki/Cusper \"Cusper\") years include Xennials, The Lucky\nOnes, Generation Catalano, and the [Oregon Trail\nGeneration](/wiki/Oregon_Trail_Generation \"Oregon Trail\nGeneration\").[59][60][61][62][63] Individuals born between the years 1995-2000\nare said to belong to the generation \"YZ\" cusp. [64]\n\n## Traits\n\nAuthors [William Strauss and Neil Howe](/wiki/Strauss_and_Howe \"Strauss and\nHowe\") believe that each generation has common characteristics that give it a\nspecific character with four basic generational archetypes, repeating in a\ncycle. According to their hypothesis, they predicted millennials will become\nmore like the \"civic-minded\" [G.I. Generation](/wiki/G.I._Generation \"G.I.\nGeneration\") with a strong sense of community both local and global.[3]\nStrauss and Howe ascribe seven basic traits to the Millennial cohort: special,\nsheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, and achieving.\nArthur E. Levine, author of _When Hope and Fear Collide: A Portrait of Today\n's College Student_ describes these generational images as \"stereotypes\".[65]\n\nStrauss and Howe's research has been influential, but it also has critics.[65]\nPsychologist Jean Twenge says Strauss and Howe's assertions are overly-\ndeterministic, non-falsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. Twenge,\nthe author of the 2006 book _Generation Me_ , considers millennials, along\nwith younger members of Generation X, to be part of what she calls \"Generation\nMe\".[66] Twenge attributes millennials with the traits of confidence and\ntolerance, but also describes a sense of [entitlement](/wiki/Entitlement\n\"Entitlement\") and [narcissism](/wiki/Narcissism \"Narcissism\"), based on\npersonality surveys showing increased narcissism among millennials compared to\npreceding generations when they were teens and in their twenties. She\nquestions the predictions of Strauss and Howe that this generation will turn\nout civic-minded.[67][68] A 2016 study by _SYZYGY_ a digital service agency,\nfound millennials in the U.S. continue to exhibit elevated scores on the\n[Narcissistic Personality Inventory](/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Inventory\n\"Narcissistic Personality Inventory\") as they age, finding millennials\nexhibited 16% more narcissism than older adults, with males scoring higher on\naverage than females. The study examined two types of narcissism: grandiose\nnarcissism, described as “the narcissism of [extraverts](/wiki/Extraversion\n\"Extraversion\"), characterized by attention-seeking behavior, power and\ndominance”, and vulnerable narcissism, described as “the narcissism of\n[introverts](/wiki/Introversion \"Introversion\"), characterized by an acute\nsense of self-entitlement and defensiveness.”[45][46][69]\n\nThe [University of Michigan](/wiki/University_of_Michigan \"University of\nMichigan\")'s \"Monitoring the Future\" study of high school seniors (conducted\ncontinually since 1975) and the American Freshman survey, conducted by UCLA's\nHigher Education Research Institute of new college students since 1966, showed\nan increase in the proportion of students who consider wealth a very important\nattribute, from 45% for Baby Boomers (surveyed between 1967 and 1985) to 70%\nfor Gen Xers, and 75% for millennials. The percentage who said it was\nimportant to keep abreast of political affairs fell, from 50% for Baby Boomers\nto 39% for Gen Xers, and 35% for millennials. The notion of \"developing a\nmeaningful philosophy of life\" decreased the most across generations, from 73%\nfor Boomers to 45% for millennials. The willingness to be involved in an\nenvironmental cleanup program dropped from 33% for Baby Boomers to 21% for\nmillennials.[70] Millennials show a willingness to vote more than previous\ngenerations. With voter rates being just below 50% for the last four\npresidential cycles, they have already surpassed Gen Xers of the same age who\nwere at just 36%.[71]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Armstrong_Legalize_Marijuana_2001.jpg/220px-\nArmstrong_Legalize_Marijuana_2001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Armstrong_Legalize_Marijuana_2001.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Armstrong_Legalize_Marijuana_2001.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTwo early millennials advocate for the legalization of marijuana at a 2001\nevent\n\nA 2013 Pew Research Poll found that 84% of millennials, born since 1980, who\nwere at that time between the ages of 18 and 32, favored [legalizing the use\nof marijuana](/wiki/Legalization_of_marijuana \"Legalization of\nmarijuana\").[72] In 2015, the Pew Research Center also conducted research\nregarding generational identity that said a majority did not like the\n\"Millennial\" label.[73]\n\nIn March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how \"millennials\nin adulthood\" are \"detached from institutions and networked with\nfriends.\"[74][75] The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than\nolder adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the\ncountry’s best years are ahead though they're the first in the modern era to\nhave higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment.\n\nFred Bonner, a Samuel DeWitt Proctor Chair in Education at [Rutgers\nUniversity](/wiki/Rutgers_University \"Rutgers University\") and author of\n_Diverse Millennial Students in College: Implications for Faculty and Student\nAffairs_ , believes that much of the commentary on the Millennial Generation\nmay be partially accurate, but overly general and that many of the traits they\ndescribe apply primarily to \"white, affluent teenagers who accomplish great\nthings as they grow up in the suburbs, who confront anxiety when applying to\nsuper-selective colleges, and who multitask with ease as their [helicopter\nparents](/wiki/Helicopter_parents \"Helicopter parents\") hover reassuringly\nabove them.\" During class discussions, Bonner listened to black and Hispanic\nstudents describe how some or all of the so-called core traits did not apply\nto them. They often said that the \"special\" trait, in particular, is\nunrecognizable. Other socio-economic groups often do not display the same\nattributes commonly attributed to millennials. \"It's not that many diverse\nparents don't want to treat their kids as special,\" he says, \"but they often\ndon't have the [social](/wiki/Social_capital \"Social capital\") and [cultural\ncapital](/wiki/Cultural_capital \"Cultural capital\"), the time and resources,\nto do that.\"[65]\n\nIn his book _Fast Future_ , author David Burstein describes millennials'\napproach to social change as \"pragmatic idealism\" with a deep desire to make\nthe world a better place, combined with an understanding that doing so\nrequires building new institutions while working inside and outside existing\ninstitutions.[76]\n\nElza Venter, an educational psychologist and lecturer at Unisa, South Africa,\nin the Department of Psychology of Education, believes members of Generation Y\nare digital natives because they have grown up experiencing digital technology\nand have known it all their lives. Prensky [77] coined the concept ‘digital\nnatives’ because this generation are ‘native speakers of the digital language\nof computers, video games and the internet’. This generation spans 20 years\nand its older members use a combination of face-to-face communication and\ncomputer [mediated communication](/wiki/Mediated_communication \"Mediated\ncommunication\"), while its younger members use mainly electronic and digital\ntechnologies for interpersonal communication.[78]\n\n## Workplace attitudes\n\nThere are vast, and conflicting, amounts of literature and empirical studies\ndiscussing the existence of generational differences as it pertains to the\nworkplace.[79] The majority of research concludes millennials differ from both\ntheir generational cohort predecessors, and can be characterized by a\npreference for a flat corporate culture, an emphasis on [work-life\nbalance](/wiki/Work%E2%80%93life_balance \"Work–life balance\") and social\nconsciousness.\n\nAccording to authors from [Florida International\nUniversity](/wiki/Florida_International_University \"Florida International\nUniversity\"), original research performed by Howe and Strauss as well as Yu &\nMiller suggest Baby Boomers resonate primarily with loyalty, work ethic,\nsteady career path, and compensation when it comes to their professional\nlives.[80] Generation X on the other hand, started shifting preferences\ntowards an improved work-life balance with a heightened focus on individual\nadvancement, stability, and job satisfaction.[80] Meanwhile, millennials place\nan emphasis on producing meaningful work, finding a creative outlet, and have\na preference for immediate feedback.[80] In the article Challenges of the Work\nof the Future it is also stressed that millennials working at the knowledge-\nbased jobs very often assume personal responsibility in order to make the most\nof what they do. As they are not satisfied with remaining for a long of time\nat the same job, their career paths become more dynamic and less\npredictable.[81] Findings also suggest the introduction of social media has\naugmented collaborative skills and created a preference for a team-oriented\nenvironment.[80]\n\nIn the 2010 the _[Journal of Business and\nPsychology](/wiki/Journal_of_Business_and_Psychology \"Journal of Business and\nPsychology\"),_ contributors Myers and Sadaghiani find millennials \"expect\nclose relationships and frequent feedback from supervisors\" to be a main point\nof differentiation.[82] Multiple studies observe millennials’ associating job\nsatisfaction with free flow of information, strong connectivity to\nsupervisors, and more immediate feedback.[82] Hershatter and Epstein,\nresearchers from [Emory University](/wiki/Emory_University \"Emory\nUniversity\"), argue a lot of these traits can be linked to millennials\nentering the educational system on the cusp of academic reform, which created\na much more structured educational system.[83] Some argue in the wake of these\nreforms, such as the [No Child Left Behind Act](/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act\n\"No Child Left Behind Act\"), millennials have increasingly sought the aid of\nmentors and advisers, leading to 66% of millennials seeking a flat work\nenvironment.[83]\n\nHershatter and Epstein also stress a growing importance on work-life balance.\nStudies show nearly one-third of students' top priority is to \"balance\npersonal and professional life\".[83] The Brain Drain Study shows nearly 9 out\nof 10 millennials place an importance on work-life balance, with additional\nsurveys demonstrating the generation to favor familial over corporate\nvalues.[83] Studies also show a preference for work-life balance, which\ncontrasts to the Baby Boomers' work-centric attitude.[82]\n\nData also suggests millennials are driving a shift towards the public service\nsector. In 2010, Myers and Sadaghiani published research in the _Journal of\nBusiness and Psychology_ stating heightened participation in the [Peace\nCorps](/wiki/Peace_Corps \"Peace Corps\") and MeriCorps as a result of\nmillennials, with volunteering being at all-time highs.[82] Volunteer activity\nbetween 2007 and 2008 show the Millennial age group experienced almost three-\ntimes the increase of the overall population, which is consistent with a\nsurvey of 130 college upperclassmen depicting an emphasis on altruism in their\nupbringing.[82] This has led, according to a Harvard University Institute of\nPolitics, six out of ten millennials to consider a career in public\nservice.[82]\n\nThe 2014 Brookings publication shows a generational adherence to corporate\nsocial responsibility, with the National Society of High School Scholars\n(NSHSS) 2013 survey and Universum’s 2011 survey, depicting a preference to\nwork for companies engaged in the betterment of society.[84] Millennials'\nshift in attitudes has led to data depicting 64% of millennials would take a\n60% pay cut to pursue a career path aligned with their passions, and financial\ninstitutions have fallen out of favor with banks comprising 40% of the\ngeneration's least liked brands.[84]\n\nIn 2008, author Ron Alsop called the millennials \"Trophy Kids,\"[85] a term\nthat reflects a trend in competitive sports, as well as many other aspects of\nlife, where mere participation is frequently enough for a reward. It has been\nreported that this is an issue in corporate environments.[85] Some employers\nare concerned that millennials have too great expectations from the\nworkplace.[86] Some studies predict they will switch jobs frequently, holding\nmany more jobs than Gen Xers due to their great expectations.[87] Psychologist\nJean Twenge reports data suggests there are differences between older and\nyounger millennials regarding workplace expectations, with younger millennials\nbeing \"more practical\" and \"more attracted to industries with steady work and\nare more likely to say they are willing to work overtime” which Twenge\nattributes to younger millennials coming of age following the financial crisis\nof 2007-2008.[88]\n\nThere is also a contention that the major differences are found solely between\nmillennials and Generation X. Researchers from the [University of\nMissouri](/wiki/University_of_Missouri \"University of Missouri\") and The\n[University of Tennessee](/wiki/University_of_Tennessee \"University of\nTennessee\") conducted a study based on measurement equivalence to determine if\nsuch a difference does in fact exist.[89] The study looked at 1,860\nparticipants who had completed the Multidimensional Work Ethic Profile (MWEP),\na survey aimed at measuring identification with work-ethic characteristics,\nacross a 12-year period spanning from 1996 to 2008.[89] The results of the\nfindings suggest the main difference in work ethic sentiments arose between\nthe two most recent generational cohorts, Generation X and millennials, with\nrelatively small variances between the two generations and their predecessor,\nthe Baby Boomers.[89]\n\nThat said, some research fails to find convincing differences. A meta study\nconducted by researchers from The [George Washington\nUniversity](/wiki/George_Washington_University \"George Washington University\")\nand The [U.S. Army](/wiki/U.S._Army \"U.S. Army\") Research Institute for the\nBehavioral and Social Sciences questions the validity of workplace differences\nacross any generational cohort. According to the researchers, disagreement in\nwhich events to include when assigning generational cohorts, as well as varied\nopinions on which age ranges to include in each generational category are the\nmain drivers behind their skepticism.[90] The analysis of 20 research reports\nfocusing on the three work-related factors of job satisfaction, organizational\ncommitment and intent to turn over proved any variation was too small to\ndiscount the impact of employee tenure and aging of individuals.[90] Newer\nresearch shows that millennials change jobs for the same reasons as other\ngenerations—namely, more money and a more innovative work environment. They\nlook for versatility and flexibility in the workplace, and strive for a strong\nwork–life balance in their jobs[91] and have similar career aspirations to\nother generations, valuing financial security and a diverse workplace just as\nmuch as their older colleagues.[92]\n\n## Political views\n\nSurveys of political attitudes among millennials in the United Kingdom have\nsuggested increasingly [social liberal](/wiki/Social_liberalism \"Social\nliberalism\") views, as well as higher overall support for [classical\nliberal](/wiki/Classical_liberalism \"Classical liberalism\") economic policies\nthan preceding generations. They are more likely to support [same-sex\nmarriage](/wiki/Same-sex_marriage \"Same-sex marriage\") and the legalization of\ndrugs.[93] _The Economist_ parallels this with millennials in the United\nStates, whose attitudes are more supportive of social liberal policies and\nsame-sex marriage relative to other demographics.[93] They are also more\nlikely to oppose [animal testing](/wiki/Animal_testing \"Animal testing\") for\nmedical purposes than older generations.[94] [Bernie\nSanders](/wiki/Bernie_Sanders \"Bernie Sanders\"), a self-proclaimed [democratic\nsocialist](/wiki/Democratic_socialist \"Democratic socialist\") and democratic\ncandidate in the [2016 United States presidential\nelection](/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election \"2016 United States\npresidential election\"), was the most popular candidate among Millennial\nvoters in the [primary phase](/wiki/United_States_presidential_primary \"United\nStates presidential primary\"), having garnered more votes from people under 30\nin 21 states than the major parties' candidates, [Donald\nTrump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") and [Hillary\nClinton](/wiki/Hillary_Clinton \"Hillary Clinton\"), did combined.[95] In April\n2016, _[The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_\nviewed him as changing the way millennials viewed politics, saying, \"He's not\nmoving a party to the left. He's moving a generation to the left.\"[96][97]\nBernie Sanders referred to millennials as \"the least prejudiced generation in\nthe history of the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\")\".[98]\nA 2014 poll for the [libertarian](/wiki/Libertarianism_in_the_United_States\n\"Libertarianism in the United States\") _[Reason](/wiki/Reason_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Reason \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine suggested that American millennials were\n[social liberals](/wiki/Social_liberal \"Social liberal\") and [fiscal\ncentrists](/wiki/Fiscal_centrism \"Fiscal centrism\"), more often than their\nglobal peers.

Pew Research noted similar age related trends in the\nUnited Kingdom, but not in Germany and Spain, where millennials were less\nsupportive of restricting offensive speech than older groups, or France, Italy\nand Poland, where there were no noticeable age differences.[110] In the U.S.\nand UK, millennials have brought changes to higher education via drawing\nattention to [microaggressions](/wiki/Microaggressions \"Microaggressions\") and\nadvocating implementation of [safe spaces](/wiki/Safe_space \"Safe space\") and\n[trigger warnings](/wiki/Trigger_warnings \"Trigger warnings\") in the\nuniversity setting.

[William\nStrauss and Neil Howe](/wiki/William_Strauss_and_Neil_Howe \"William Strauss\nand Neil Howe\") projected in their 1991 book _Generations_ that the U.S.\nMillennial population would be 76 million.[113]\nLater,[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_] using dates ranging from 1982\nto 2004, Neil Howe revised the number to over 95 million people (in the\nU.S.).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] In a 2012 [_Time_ magazine](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time\n\\(magazine\\)\") article, it was estimated that there were approximately 80\nmillion U.S. millennials.[114] The [United States Census\nBureau](/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau \"United States Census Bureau\"),\nusing birth dates ranging from 1982 to 2000, stated the estimated number of\nU.S. millennials in 2015 was 83.1 million people.[115]\n\nIn 2016, the [Pew Research Center](/wiki/Pew_Research_Center \"Pew Research\nCenter\") found that millennials surpassed Baby Boomers to become the largest\nliving generation in the United States. By analyzing 2015 [U.S\nCensus](/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau \"United States Census Bureau\") data\nthey found there were 75.4 million millennials, based on Pew's definition of\nthe generation which ranges from 1981 to 1997, compared to 74.9 million Baby\nBoomers.[116][117]\n\n## Economic prospects\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/1_-_Hamburg_1._Mai_2014_07.JPG/220px-1_-_Hamburg_1._Mai_2014_07.JPG)](/wiki/File:1_-_Hamburg_1._Mai_2014_07.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1_-_Hamburg_1._Mai_2014_07.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nGerman young adults protest youth unemployment at a 2014 event\n\nEconomic prospects for some millennials have declined largely due to the\n[Great Recession](/wiki/Great_Recession \"Great Recession\") in the late\n2000s.[118][119][120] Several governments have instituted major youth\nemployment schemes out of fear of social unrest due to the dramatically\nincreased rates of [youth unemployment](/wiki/Youth_unemployment \"Youth\nunemployment\").[121] In Europe, youth unemployment levels were very high (56%\nin Spain,[122] 44% in Italy,[123] 35% in the Baltic states, 19.1% in\nBritain[124] and more than 20% in many more countries). In 2009, leading\ncommentators began to worry about the long-term social and economic effects of\nthe unemployment.[125] Unemployment levels in other areas of the world were\nalso high, with the youth [unemployment rate in the\nU.S.](/wiki/Unemployment_rate_in_the_U.S. \"Unemployment rate in the U.S.\")\nreaching a record 19.1% in July 2010 since the statistic started being\ngathered in 1948.[126] In [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\"), unemployment among\nyouths in July 2009 was 15.9%, the highest it had been in 11 years.[127]\n[Underemployment](/wiki/Underemployment \"Underemployment\") is also a major\nfactor. In the U.S. the economic difficulties have led to dramatic increases\nin youth poverty, unemployment, and the numbers of young people living with\ntheir parents.[128] In April 2012, it was reported that half of all new\ncollege graduates in the US were still either unemployed or\nunderemployed.[129] It has been argued that this unemployment rate and poor\neconomic situation has given millennials a rallying call with the 2011 [Occupy\nWall Street](/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street \"Occupy Wall Street\") movement.[130]\nHowever, according to Christine Kelly, Occupy is not a [youth\nmovement](/wiki/Youth_movement \"Youth movement\") and has participants that\nvary from the very young to very old.[131]\n\nA variety of names have emerged in various European countries hard hit\nfollowing the [financial crisis of\n2007–2008](/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008 \"Financial crisis of\n2007–2008\") to designate young people with limited employment and career\nprospects.[132] These groups can be considered to be more or less synonymous\nwith millennials, or at least major sub-groups in those countries. _The\nGeneration of €700_ is a term popularized by the [Greek mass\nmedia](/wiki/Media_in_Greece#Mass_media \"Media in Greece\") and refers to\neducated [Greek](/wiki/Greek_people \"Greek people\") [twixters](/wiki/Twixter\n\"Twixter\") of urban centers who generally fail to establish a\n[career](/wiki/Career \"Career\"). In Greece, young adults are being \"excluded\nfrom the labor market\" and some \"leave their country of origin to look for\nbetter options\". They're being \"marginalized and face uncertain working\nconditions\" in jobs that are unrelated to their educational background, and\nreceive the minimum allowable base [salary](/wiki/Salary \"Salary\") of €700 per\nmonth. This generation evolved in circumstances leading to the [Greek debt\ncrisis](/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis \"Greek government-debt crisis\") and\nsome participated in the [2010–2011 Greek protests](/wiki/Anti-\nausterity_movement_in_Greece \"Anti-austerity movement in Greece\").[133] In\nSpain, they're referred to as the _mileurista_ (for €1,000 per month),[134] in\nFrance \"The Precarious Generation,[135]\" and as in Spain, Italy also has the\n\"milleurista\"; generation of 1,000 euros (per month).[132]\n\nIn 2015, millennials in New York City were reported as earning 20% less than\nthe generation before them, as a result of entering the workforce during the\n[great recession](/wiki/Great_Recession_in_the_United_States \"Great Recession\nin the United States\"). Despite higher college attendance rates than\nGeneration X, many were stuck in low-paid jobs, with the percentage of degree-\neducated young adults working in low-wage industries rising from 23% to 33%\nbetween 2000 and 2014.[136] In 2016, research from the [Resolution\nFoundation](/wiki/Resolution_Foundation \"Resolution Foundation\") found\nmillennials in the UK earned £8,000 less in their 20s than Generation X,\ndescribing millennials as \"on course to become the first generation to earn\nless than the one before\".[137][138]\n\n_Generation Flux_ is a [neologism](/wiki/Neologism \"Neologism\") and\n[psychographic](/wiki/Psychographic \"Psychographic\") (not demographic)\ndesignation coined by _[Fast Company](/wiki/Fast_Company_\\(magazine\\) \"Fast\nCompany \\(magazine\\)\")_ for [American\nemployees](/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States \"Economy of the United States\")\nwho need to make several changes in [career](/wiki/Career \"Career\") throughout\ntheir working lives due to the chaotic nature of the job market following the\nGreat Recession.

Millennials are the most highly educated and culturally diverse group\nof all generations, and have been regarded as hard to please when it comes to\nemployers.[141] To address these new challenges, many large firms are\ncurrently studying the social and behavioral patterns of millennials and are\ntrying to devise programs that decrease intergenerational estrangement, and\nincrease relationships of reciprocal understanding between older employees and\nmillennials. The UK's [Institute of Leadership &\nManagement](/wiki/Institute_of_Leadership_%26_Management \"Institute of\nLeadership & Management\") researched the gap in understanding between\nMillennial recruits and their managers in collaboration with [Ashridge\nBusiness School](/wiki/Ashridge_Business_School \"Ashridge Business\nSchool\").[142] The findings included high expectations for advancement, salary\nand for a coaching relationship with their manager, and suggested that\norganizations will need to adapt to accommodate and make the best use of\nmillennials. In an example of a company trying to do just this, [Goldman\nSachs](/wiki/Goldman_Sachs \"Goldman Sachs\") conducted training programs that\nused actors to portray millennials who assertively sought more\n[feedback](/wiki/Feedback \"Feedback\"),\n[responsibility](/wiki/Moral_responsibility \"Moral responsibility\"), and\ninvolvement in decision making. After the performance, employees discussed and\ndebated the generational differences they saw played out.[85]\n\nMillennials have benefited the least from the economic recovery following the\n[Great Recession](/wiki/Great_Recession \"Great Recession\"), as average incomes\nfor this generation have fallen at twice the general adult population's total\ndrop and are likely to be on a path toward lower incomes for at least another\ndecade. A [Bloomberg L.P.](/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P. \"Bloomberg L.P.\") article\nwrote that \"Three and a half years after the worst recession since the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\"), the earnings and\nemployment gap between those in the under-35 population and their parents and\ngrandparents threatens to unravel the American dream of each generation doing\nbetter than the last. The nation's younger workers have benefited least from\nan economic recovery that has been the most uneven in recent history.\"[143]\n\nIn 2014, millennials were entering an increasingly multi-generational\nworkplace.[144] Even though research has shown that millennials are joining\nthe workforce during a tough economic time they still have remained\noptimistic, as shown when about nine out of ten millennials surveyed by the\nPew Research Center said that they currently have enough money or that they\nwill eventually reach their long-term financial goals.[145]\n\n## Peter Pan generation\n\nAmerican sociologist Kathleen Shaputis labeled millennials as the _[Boomerang\nGeneration](/wiki/Boomerang_Generation \"Boomerang Generation\")_ or _[Peter\nPan](/wiki/Peter_Pan \"Peter Pan\") generation_, because of the members'\nperceived tendency for delaying some [rites of passage](/wiki/Rites_of_passage\n\"Rites of passage\") into adulthood for longer periods than most generations\nbefore them. These labels were also a reference to a trend toward members\nliving with their parents for longer periods than previous generations.[146]\nKimberly Palmer regards the high cost of housing and higher education, and the\nrelative affluence of older generations, as among the factors driving the\ntrend.[147] Questions regarding a clear definition of what it means to be an\nadult also impacts a debate about delayed transitions into adulthood and the\nemergence of a new life stage, Emerging Adulthood. A 2012 study by professors\nat [Brigham Young University](/wiki/Brigham_Young_University \"Brigham Young\nUniversity\") found that college students were more likely to define \"adult\"\nbased on certain personal abilities and characteristics rather than more\ntraditional \"rite of passage\" events.[148] Larry Nelson noted that \"In prior\ngenerations, you get married and you start a career and you do that\nimmediately. What young people today are seeing is that approach has led to\ndivorces, to people unhappy with their careers … The majority want to get\nmarried […] they just want to do it right the first time, the same thing with\ntheir careers.\"[148] Their expectations have had a dampening effect on\nmillennials' rate of marriage.\n\nA 2013 joint study by sociologists at the [University of\nVirginia](/wiki/University_of_Virginia \"University of Virginia\") and [Harvard\nUniversity](/wiki/Harvard_University \"Harvard University\") found that the\ndecline and disappearance of stable full-time jobs with [health\ninsurance](/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States \"Health insurance in\nthe United States\") and pensions for people who lack a college degree has had\nprofound effects on [working-class Americans](/wiki/Working-class_Americans\n\"Working-class Americans\"), who now are less likely to marry and have children\nwithin marriage than those with college degrees.[149] Data from a 2014 study\nof U.S. millennials revealed over 56% of this cohort considers themselves as\npart of the working class, with only approximately 35% considering themselves\nas part of the middle class; this class identity is the lowest polling of any\ngeneration.[150]\n\nResearch by the [Urban Institute](/wiki/Urban_Institute \"Urban Institute\")\nconducted in 2014, projected that if current trends continue, millennials will\nhave a lower marriage rate compared to previous generations, predicting that\nby age 40, 30.7% of millennial women will remain single, approximately twice\nthe share of their single Gen X counterparts. The data showed similar trends\nfor males.[151][152] A 2016 study from [Pew Research](/wiki/Pew_Research \"Pew\nResearch\") showed millennials delay some activities considered rites of\npassage of adulthood with data showing young adults aged 18–34 were more\nlikely to live with parents than with a relationship partner, an unprecedented\noccurrence since data collection began in 1880. Data also showed a significant\nincrease in the percentage of young adults living with parents compared to the\nprevious demographic cohort, [Generation X](/wiki/Generation_X \"Generation\nX\"), with 23% of young adults aged 18–34 living with parents in 2000, rising\nto 32% in 2014. Additionally, in 2000, 43% of those aged 18–34 were married or\nliving with a partner, with this figure dropping to 31.6% in 2014. High\nstudent debt is described as one reason for continuing to live with parents,\nbut may not be the dominant factor for this shift as the data shows the trend\nis stronger for those without a college education. Richard Fry, a senior\neconomist for Pew Research said of millennials, “they're the group much more\nlikely to live with their parents.” furthering “they're concentrating more on\nschool, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or\npartners and children”.[153][154]\n\nAccording to a cross-generational study comparing millennials to Generation X\nconducted at [Wharton School of Business](/wiki/Wharton_School_of_Business\n\"Wharton School of Business\"), more than half of Millennial undergraduates\nsurveyed do not plan to have children. The researchers compared surveys of the\nWharton graduating class of 1992 and 2012. In 1992, 78% of women planned to\neventually have children dropping to 42% in 2012. The results were similar for\nmale students. The research revealed among both genders the proportion of\nundergraduates who reported they eventually planned to have children had\ndropped in half over the course of a generation.[155][156][157]\n\n## Religion\n\nIn the U.S., millennials are the least likely to be religious.[158] There is a\ntrend towards [irreligion](/wiki/Irreligion \"Irreligion\") that has been\nincreasing since the 1940s.[159] 29 percent of Americans born between 1983 and\n1994 are irreligious, as opposed to 21 percent born between 1963 and 1981, 15\npercent born between 1948 and 1962 and only 7 percent born before 1948.[160] A\n2005 study looked at 1,385 people aged 18 to 25 and found that more than half\nof those in the study said that they pray regularly before a meal. One-third\nsaid that they discussed [religion](/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States\n\"Religion in the United States\") with friends, attended religious services,\nand read religious material weekly. Twenty-three percent of those studied did\nnot identify themselves as religious practitioners.[161] A Pew Research Center\nstudy on millennials shows that of those between 18–29 years old, only 3% of\nthese emerging adults self-identified as \"[atheists](/wiki/Atheism \"Atheism\")\"\nand only 4% self-identified as \"[agnostics](/wiki/Agnosticism \"Agnosticism\")\".\nOverall, 25% of millennials are \"Nones\" and 75% are religiously\naffiliated.[162]\n\nOver half of millennials polled in the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom\n\"United Kingdom\") in 2013 said they had \"no religion nor attended a place of\nworship\", other than for a wedding or a funeral. 25% said they \"believe in a\n[God](/wiki/God \"God\")\", while 19% believed in a \"spiritual greater power\" and\n38% said they did not believe in God nor any other \"greater spiritual power\".\nThe poll also found 41% thought\n[religion](/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Religion in the United\nKingdom\") was \"the cause of evil\" in the world more often than good.[163] The\n[British Social Attitudes Survey](/wiki/British_Social_Attitudes_Survey\n\"British Social Attitudes Survey\") found that 71% of British 18-24 year-olds\nwere not religious, with just 3% affiliated to the once-dominant [Church of\nEngland](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of England\").[164]\n\n## Digital technology\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/People_using_cellphones_on_a_street_in_New_York.jpg/220px-\nPeople_using_cellphones_on_a_street_in_New_York.jpg)](/wiki/File:People_using_cellphones_on_a_street_in_New_York.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:People_using_cellphones_on_a_street_in_New_York.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThree people who appear to be millennials using smartphones\n\nIn their 2007 book, authors Junco and Mastrodicasa expanded on the work of\n[William Strauss](/wiki/William_Strauss \"William Strauss\") and [Neil\nHowe](/wiki/Neil_Howe \"Neil Howe\") to include research-based information about\nthe personality profiles of millennials, especially as it relates to higher\neducation. They conducted a large-sample (7,705) research study of\n[college](/wiki/College \"College\") [students](/wiki/Student \"Student\"). They\nfound that Next Generation college students, born between 1983–1992, were\nfrequently in touch with their parents and they used\n[technology](/wiki/Technology \"Technology\") at higher rates than people from\n[other generations](/wiki/List_of_Generations \"List of Generations\"). In their\nsurvey, they found that 97% of these students owned a\n[computer](/wiki/Computer \"Computer\"), 94% owned a [mobile\nphone](/wiki/Mobile_phone \"Mobile phone\"), and 56% owned an [MP3\nplayer](/wiki/MP3_player \"MP3 player\"). They also found that students spoke\nwith their parents an average of 1.5 times a day about a wide range of topics.\nOther findings in the Junco and Mastrodicasa survey revealed 76% of students\nused [instant messaging](/wiki/Instant_messaging \"Instant messaging\"), 92% of\nthose reported [multitasking](/wiki/Human_multitasking \"Human multitasking\")\nwhile instant messaging, 40% of them used [television](/wiki/Television\n\"Television\") to get most of their news, and 34% of students surveyed used the\n[Internet](/wiki/Internet \"Internet\") as their primary news source.[165][166]\nOlder millennials came of age prior to widespread usage and availability of\n[smartphones](/wiki/Smartphones \"Smartphones\"), defined as those born 1988 and\nearlier, in contrast to younger millennials, those born in 1989 and later, who\nwere exposed to this technology in their teen years.[88]\n\nGen Xers and millennials were the first to grow up with computers in their\nhomes. In a 1999 speech at the [New York Institute of\nTechnology](/wiki/New_York_Institute_of_Technology \"New York Institute of\nTechnology\"), [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\") Chairman and CEO [Bill\nGates](/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\") encouraged America's teachers to use\ntechnology to serve the needs of the first generation of kids to grow up with\nthe Internet.[167] Some millennials enjoy having hundreds of channels from\n[cable TV](/wiki/Cable_TV \"Cable TV\"). However, some other millennials do not\neven have a [TV](/wiki/TV \"TV\"), so they watch media over the Internet using\nsmartphones and tablets.[168] One of the most popular forms of media use by\nmillennials is social networking. In 2010, research was published in the Elon\nJournal of Undergraduate Research which claimed that students who used social\nmedia and decided to quit showed the same withdrawal symptoms of a drug addict\nwho quit their stimulant.[169] [Marc Prensky](/wiki/Marc_Prensky \"Marc\nPrensky\") coined the term \"[digital native](/wiki/Digital_native \"Digital\nnative\")\" to describe \"K through college\" students in 2001, explaining they\n\"represent the first generations to grow up with this new technology.\"[170]\nMillennials are identified as \"digital natives\" by the Pew Research Center\nwhich conducted a survey titled _Millennials in Adulthood._[75]\n\nMillennials use social networking sites, such as [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook\n\"Facebook\"), to create a different sense of belonging, make acquaintances, and\nto remain connected with friends.[171] In the\n[Frontline](/wiki/Frontline_\\(U.S._TV_series\\) \"Frontline \\(U.S. TV series\\)\")\nepisode \"Generation Like\" there is discussion about millennials, their\ndependence on technology, and the ways the social media sphere is\n[commoditized](/wiki/Commodity \"Commodity\").[172]\n\n## Cultural identity\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lesbian_Wedding_3.jpg/220px-\nLesbian_Wedding_3.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lesbian_Wedding_3.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Lesbian_Wedding_3.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTwo women celebrate a [same-sex marriage](/wiki/Same-sex_marriage \"Same-sex\nmarriage\") in 2007\n\n[Strauss & Howe](/wiki/Strauss_%26_Howe \"Strauss & Howe\")'s book titled\n_Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation_ describes the Millennial\ngeneration as \"civic-minded\", rejecting the attitudes of the [Baby\nBoomers](/wiki/Baby_Boomers \"Baby Boomers\") and [Generation\nX](/wiki/Generation_X \"Generation X\").[173] Since the 2000 U.S. Census, which\nallowed people to select more than one racial group, millennials in abundance\nhave asserted the ideal that all their heritages should be respected, counted,\nand acknowledged.[174][175] Millennials are the children of Baby Boomers or\nGeneration X, while some older members may have parents from the [Silent\nGeneration](/wiki/Silent_Generation \"Silent Generation\"). A 2013 poll in the\n[United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") found that Generation\nY was more \"open-minded than their parents on controversial topics\".[163][176]\nOf those surveyed, nearly 75% supported [same-sex marriage](/wiki/Same-\nsex_marriage \"Same-sex marriage\").\n\nA 2013 Pew Research Poll found that 84% of millennials, born since 1980, who\nwere at that time between the ages of 18 and 32, favored [legalizing the use\nof marijuana](/wiki/Legalization_of_marijuana \"Legalization of\nmarijuana\").[72] In 2015, the Pew Research Center also conducted research\nregarding generational identity.[73] It was discovered that millennials are\nless likely to strongly identify with the generational term when compared to\nGeneration X or to the Baby Boomers, with only 40% of those born between 1981\nand 1997 identifying as part of the Millennial Generation. Among older\nmillennials, those born 1981–1988, Pew Research found 43% personally\nidentified as members of the older demographic cohort, Generation X, while\nonly 35% identified as millennials. Among younger millennials (born\n1989–1997), generational identity was not much stronger, with only 45%\npersonally identifying as millennials. It was also found that millennials\nchose most often to define itself with more negative terms such as self-\nabsorbed, wasteful or greedy. In this 2015 report, Pew defined millennials\nwith birth years ranging from 1981 onwards.[73]\n\nMillennials came of age in a time where the entertainment industry began to be\naffected by the Internet.[177][178][179] In addition to millennials being the\nmost ethnically and racially diverse compared to the generations older than\nthey are, they are also on pace to be the most formally educated. As of\n2008[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Millennials&action=edit),\n39.6% of millennials between the ages of 18 and 24 were enrolled in college,\nwhich was an American record. Along with being educated, millennials also tend\nto upbeat. As stated above in the economic prospects section, about 9 out of\n10 millennials feel as though they have enough money or that they will reach\ntheir long-term financial goals, even during the tough economic times, and\nthey are more optimistic about the future of the U.S. Additionally,\nmillennials are also more open to change than older generations. According to\nthe Pew Research Center that did a survey in 2008, millennials are the most\nlikely of any generation to self-identify as\n[liberals](/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States \"Modern liberalism in\nthe United States\") and are also more supportive of\n[progressive](/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States \"Progressivism in the\nUnited States\") domestic social agenda than older generations. Finally,\nmillennials are less overtly religious than the older generations.
