Thomson's dramatic three-run homer came in the ninth inning of\nthe decisive third game of a [three-game playoff for the\npennant](/wiki/1951_National_League_tie-breaker_series \"1951 National League\ntie-breaker series\") in which the Giants trailed, 4–2.[1]\n\nThe game—the first ever televised nationally—was seen by millions of viewers\nacross America and heard on radio by millions more, including thousands of\nAmerican servicemen stationed in [Korea](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\"),\nlistening on [Armed Forces Radio](/wiki/Armed_Forces_Radio \"Armed Forces\nRadio\"). The classic drama of snatching victory from defeat to secure a\npennant was intensified by the epic [cross-town\nrivalry](/wiki/Dodgers%E2%80%93Giants_rivalry \"Dodgers–Giants rivalry\")\nbetween the Giants and Dodgers, and by a remarkable string of victories in the\nlast weeks of the regular season by the Giants, who won 37 of their last 44\ngames to catch the first-place Dodgers and force a playoff series to decide\nthe NL champion. The Giants' late-season rally and 2-to-1-game playoff\nvictory, capped by Thomson's moment of triumph, are collectively known in\nbaseball lore as \"The Miracle of [Coogan's Bluff](/wiki/Coogan%27s_Bluff\n\"Coogan's Bluff\")\", a descriptor coined by the legendary sports columnist [Red\nSmith](/wiki/Red_Smith_\\(sportswriter\\) \"Red Smith \\(sportswriter\\)\").[2]\n\nThe phrase \"[shot heard 'round the world](/wiki/Shot_heard_%27round_the_world\n\"Shot heard 'round the world\")\" is from the poem \"[Concord\nHymn](/wiki/Concord_Hymn \"Concord Hymn\")\" (1837) by [Ralph Waldo\nEmerson](/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson \"Ralph Waldo Emerson\") about the first\nclash of the [American Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War\n\"American Revolutionary War\"). It later became popularly associated with\nThomson's homer and several other dramatic historical moments.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 The game\n  * 3 The broadcasts\n    * 3.1 Russ Hodges\n    * 3.2 Ernie Harwell\n    * 3.3 Red Barber\n    * 3.4 Gordon McLendon\n    * 3.5 Other\n  * 4 Aftermath\n    * 4.1 Controversy\n  * 5 Artifacts\n  * 6 Legacy\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 Further reading\n  * 9 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nThe principal [National League](/wiki/National_League \"National League\") (NL)\ncontenders in [1951](/wiki/1951_Major_League_Baseball_season \"1951 Major\nLeague Baseball season\") were the [New York\nGiants](/wiki/New_York_Giants_\\(NL\\) \"New York Giants \\(NL\\)\"), [Brooklyn\nDodgers](/wiki/Brooklyn_Dodgers \"Brooklyn Dodgers\"), and [Philadelphia\nPhillies](/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies \"Philadelphia Phillies\"). The Dodgers\nquickly pulled into first place, and widened their lead as the season\nprogressed. On August 11, with a  13 1⁄2-game lead over the second-place\nGiants, they appeared certain to face the [New York\nYankees](/wiki/New_York_Yankees \"New York Yankees\") in the [World\nSeries](/wiki/1951_World_Series \"1951 World Series\").[4] \"Unless [the Dodgers]\ncompletely fold in their last 50 games\", wrote an Associated Press writer,\n\"they're in.\"[5] The Phillies,  14 1⁄2 [games back](/wiki/Games_back \"Games\nback\"), faded from contention; but the Giants won 16 straight games from\nAugust 12 to August 27, cutting the Dodgers' lead to six games.[6] By\nSeptember 20, they had pulled to within  4 1⁄2 games,[7] still a prohibitive\nmargin with only ten days remaining in the season; but the Giants won all of\ntheir final seven games, while the Dodgers lost six of their last ten. The two\nteams concluded the regular season deadlocked with 96–58 records.[8]\n\nThe NL used a three-game playoff at that time to break ties for the\n[pennant](/wiki/Pennant_\\(sports\\) \"Pennant \\(sports\\)\"). The Dodgers won the\ncoin toss to determine the playoff schedule; they elected to play the first\ngame at home and the second (and third if needed) at the Polo Grounds,\nreasoning that after a likely win in Brooklyn, they would need to win only one\nof two at the Giants' park.[9] Nevertheless, in game one at [Ebbets\nField](/wiki/Ebbets_Field \"Ebbets Field\"), the Giants, with [Jim\nHearn](/wiki/Jim_Hearn \"Jim Hearn\") on the mound, defeated the Dodgers' [Ralph\nBranca](/wiki/Ralph_Branca \"Ralph Branca\") 3–1,[10] thanks to [home\nruns](/wiki/Home_run \"Home run\") by [Bobby Thomson](/wiki/Bobby_Thomson \"Bobby\nThomson\") and [Monte Irvin](/wiki/Monte_Irvin \"Monte Irvin\").[11] In game two\nat the Polo Grounds, with the Yankees team in attendance as spectators,[12]\nthe Dodgers tied the series, winning 10–0 on home runs by [Jackie\nRobinson](/wiki/Jackie_Robinson \"Jackie Robinson\"), [Gil\nHodges](/wiki/Gil_Hodges \"Gil Hodges\"), [Andy Pafko](/wiki/Andy_Pafko \"Andy\nPafko\"), and [Rube Walker](/wiki/Rube_Walker \"Rube Walker\"), who was catching\nin place of an injured [Roy Campanella](/wiki/Roy_Campanella \"Roy\nCampanella\").

A Giants\nrally in the second inning, initiated by [Whitey Lockman](/wiki/Whitey_Lockman\n\"Whitey Lockman\")'s single, fizzled when Thomson, trying to stretch a single\ninto a double, failed to notice that Lockman had not advanced to third base,\nand was tagged out by Robinson.[2] The score remained 1–0 through the sixth\ninning.[16] In the seventh inning, Irvin led off with a double for the Giants.\nHe was bunted over to third, and scored on a [sacrifice\nfly](/wiki/Sacrifice_fly \"Sacrifice fly\") by Thomson, tying the score at one\nrun each.[16]\n\nIn the top of the eighth, the Dodgers came back with three runs. With Reese\nand [Duke Snider](/wiki/Duke_Snider \"Duke Snider\") on third and first after\nback-to-back singles, a Maglie [wild pitch](/wiki/Wild_pitch \"Wild pitch\")\nallowed Reese to score and Snider to advance to second. Robinson was walked\nintentionally to set up a double play, but Pafko's ground ball to third\nbounced off the heel of Thomson's glove; Snider scored and Robinson took\nthird. [Billy Cox](/wiki/Billy_Cox_\\(baseball\\) \"Billy Cox \\(baseball\\)\")\nadded another single to score Robinson, making the score 4–1 in favor of the\nDodgers.[16] Newcombe set down the Giants in order in the bottom of the\neighth, while [Larry Jansen](/wiki/Larry_Jansen \"Larry Jansen\") did the same\nin relief of Maglie in the top of the ninth.[17]\n\nNewcombe had pitched a complete game on September 29, four days earlier, in\nPhiladelphia, followed by 5⅔ innings in relief the following day during the\nlast game of the regular season. According to some accounts, after eight\ninnings on only two days' rest he attempted to take himself out of the game,\nbut Robinson demanded that he continue: \"You go out there and pitch until your\narm falls off!\" Newcombe himself insisted that he never asked to be relieved—a\nversion corroborated by Snider and Pafko.[18]\n\nGiants shortstop [Alvin Dark](/wiki/Alvin_Dark \"Alvin Dark\") singled off\nNewcombe to start the bottom-ninth rally. At that point, the Dodgers made a\ncrucial defensive mistake: With no outs, a runner on first, and a 3-run lead,\nthe normal strategy would be to position the infield for a possible double\nplay; but first baseman [Gil Hodges](/wiki/Gil_Hodges \"Gil Hodges\") played\nbehind Dark—apparently guarding against a highly unlikely steal\nattempt—leaving a large gap on the right side of the infield.[9] [Don\nMueller](/wiki/Don_Mueller \"Don Mueller\"), batting left-handed, hit a single\nthrough that gap, advancing Dark from first to third. Instead of a rally-\nkilling double play, the Dodgers found themselves facing the potential tying\nrun at the plate with two runners on base, nobody out, and Irvin—with 121\nregular-season RBIs—at bat; but Newcombe got Irvin to chase an outside pitch\nand foul out to Hodges.[9] (Sportswriter [Bud Greenspan](/wiki/Bud_Greenspan\n\"Bud Greenspan\") and others have argued that, had the Dodger infield played\nMueller at double-play depth, Irvin's pop-up would in all likelihood have been\nthe season-ending third out.[19])\n\nLockman followed with a double down the left field line, driving in Dark and\nadvancing Mueller to third. Mueller slid awkwardly into the base, injuring his\nankle, and was replaced by pinch runner [Clint Hartung](/wiki/Clint_Hartung\n\"Clint Hartung\").[9] With Thomson coming up, Dodgers manager [Chuck\nDressen](/wiki/Chuck_Dressen \"Chuck Dressen\") finally pulled the exhausted\nNewcombe. In the bullpen, where Branca and [Carl Erskine](/wiki/Carl_Erskine\n\"Carl Erskine\") were warming up, coach [Clyde Sukeforth](/wiki/Clyde_Sukeforth\n\"Clyde Sukeforth\") noticed that Erskine—who had been troubled by arm problems\nall season—was bouncing his curve balls short of the plate, and advised\nDressen to use Branca in relief. That decision has been continually second-\nguessed by fans, sportswriters, and baseball historians: Branca had lost six\nof his last seven decisions, and gave up a game-winning home run to Thomson in\nthe first playoff game. Dressen's options, however, were severely limited: the\nonly other available pitchers with crucial-situation experience were [Clyde\nKing](/wiki/Clyde_King \"Clyde King\"), who was sidelined with biceps\ntendonitis; [Preacher Roe](/wiki/Preacher_Roe \"Preacher Roe\"), who was left-\nhanded; and Labine, who had pitched a complete game the day before. This was\nthe second questionable decision that inning by Dressen.[20]\n\nThomson was now at bat, with first base open and [Willie\nMays](/wiki/Willie_Mays \"Willie Mays\") (soon to be named the NL [Rookie of the\nYear](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award \"Major League\nBaseball Rookie of the Year Award\")) on deck. Mays had gone 0-for-3 with two\nstrikeouts against Branca in the first playoff game, but Dressen was unwilling\nto put the winning run on base, and worried that a veteran pinch hitter might\nbe brought in to bat for Mays if he did so.[9] In the third controversial\ndecision, he elected to pitch to Thomson rather than walk him\nintentionally.[21] Thomson later recalled that as he left the on-deck circle,\nGiants manager [Leo Durocher](/wiki/Leo_Durocher \"Leo Durocher\") turned to him\nand said, \"If you ever hit one, hit it now.\"[22]\n\nBranca's first pitch was a called strike on the inside corner. His second was\na fastball high and inside, intended as a setup for his next, a breaking ball\ndown and away; but Thomson pulled the fastball down the left field line. The\nball disappeared into the lower-deck stands near the left field foul line for\na game-ending, three-run home run. Thomson ran the bases, then disappeared\ninto a mob of jubilant teammates gathered at home plate. The stunned Dodger\nplayers began the long walk toward the visitors' clubhouse under the center\nfield bleachers; Robinson turned to watch Thomson, making certain that he\ntouched every base, before following his teammates off the field.[9]\n\nLater, after the celebrations had calmed down, a delegation of Dodgers—Reese,\nSnider, Roe, and Robinson—visited the Giants' locker room to offer their\ncongratulations. \"I just want you to know that we didn't lose the pennant,\"\nRobinson told them. \"You guys won it.\"[9]\n\n## The\nbroadcasts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: The broadcasts\")]\n\nSeveral television and radio broadcasters captured the moment for baseball\nfans in the New York City area and nationwide.[23]\n\n### Russ\nHodges[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Russ Hodges\")]\n\nThe best known live description—\"arguably the most famous call in\nsports\"[24]—was delivered by [Russ Hodges](/wiki/Russ_Hodges \"Russ Hodges\"),\nwho was broadcasting the game on [WMCA-AM](/wiki/WMCA_\\(AM\\) \"WMCA \\(AM\\)\")\nradio for Giants fans. His call captured the suddenness and exultation of the\nhome run:\n\n“ | There's a long drive ... it's gonna be, I believe ... _The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!

The Giants won it by a score of 5 to 4, and they're picking Bobby Thomson up, and carrying him off the field![25] | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \nBroadcasts were not routinely taped in 1951, and no one at any of the local\nradio or television stations was recording the game. The WMCA call survives\nonly because a Brooklyn-based fan named Lawrence Goldberg asked his mother to\ntape-record the last half-inning of the radio broadcast while he was at\nwork.[26] In later years, Hodges told interviewers that Goldberg was a Dodgers\nfan who made the tape \"so he could hear the voice of the Giants weep when\nBrooklyn won\". In fact, Goldberg had been a Giants fan since\nchildhood.[26][27]\n\n### Ernie\nHarwell[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Ernie Harwell\")]\n\nHodges' broadcast partner, [Ernie Harwell](/wiki/Ernie_Harwell \"Ernie\nHarwell\"), called the game for the Giants' television flagship\n[WPIX](/wiki/WPIX \"WPIX\"); the independent station's broadcast was carried\nnationally on the [NBC](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_on_NBC \"Major League\nBaseball on NBC\") network, the first coast-to-coast live telecast of a Major\nLeague Baseball game. His description was not recorded; he later recalled\nsaying simply, \"It's gone!\" almost at the moment Thomson's bat struck the\nball—and then watching in dismay as the ball began to sink. \"I said to myself,\n'If that ball drops into Pafko's glove, I'm in deep trouble.' \"[9] As the ball\ndisappeared into the lower deck, he recalled, no further commentary was\nnecessary. \"The pictures took over.\"[28]\n\n### Red\nBarber[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Red Barber\")]\n\nDodgers announcer [Red Barber](/wiki/Red_Barber \"Red Barber\"), calling the\ngame for [WMGM-AM](/wiki/WEPN_\\(AM\\) \"WEPN \\(AM\\)\") radio, straightforwardly\nsaid, \"Branca pumps, delivers – a curve, swung on and belted, deep shot to\nleft field—it is—a home run!

McLendon's account\n(complete with a similarly enthusiastic yell of \"_The Giants win the pennant!\n\"_)—preserved on Harwell's \"Audio Scrapbook\"—remains the only professionally\nrecorded broadcast account of the entire third game.[29]\n\n###\nOther[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Other\")]\n\nThe game was also called on radio by [Al Helfer](/wiki/Al_Helfer \"Al Helfer\")\nfor the [Mutual](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_on_Mutual \"Major League Baseball\non Mutual\") network, by [Buck Canel](/wiki/Buck_Canel \"Buck Canel\") and [Felo\nRamírez](/wiki/Felo_Ram%C3%ADrez \"Felo Ramírez\") for a [Spanish\nlanguage](/wiki/Spanish_language \"Spanish language\") network, and by [Nat\nAllbright](/wiki/Nat_Allbright \"Nat Allbright\") in a studio re-creation for\nthe Dodgers' secondary network in the South.

He denied that his role in the final inning of the\nShot game had any bearing on his decision to leave.[35] Some historians have\nsince speculated otherwise, based on Dressen's post-game reply to why he\nbrought in Branca: \"Sukeforth said he was ready.\"[36] Sukeforth told a\njournalist in 2000—the last year of his life—that \"everybody knows the manager\nis responsible for decisions.\" He added, \"It didn't matter what anybody said\n... Branca was the only one who could come in when that big guy [Newcombe]\ncouldn't go any further.\"[37]\n\nIndividual recollections of Thomson's home run continued to emerge decades\nafter the event. In the 1990s, Thomson received a letter from a\n[Marine](/wiki/Marines \"Marines\") who had been stationed in\n[Korea](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\") in 1951:\n\n    \"I was in a bunker in the front line with my buddy listening to the radio. It was contrary to orders, but he was a Giants fanatic. He never made it home and I promised him if I ever got back I'd write and tell you about the happiest moment of his life. It's taken me this long to put my feelings into words. On behalf of my buddy, thanks, Bobby.\"[38]\n\nIn the fall of 2001, surviving members of the 1951 Giants and Dodgers,\nincluding Thomson and Branca, met at [Coogan's Bluff](/wiki/Coogan%27s_Bluff\n\"Coogan's Bluff\"), overlooking the site of the long since demolished ballpark,\nto celebrate the 50th anniversary of the game.[39]\n\nThomson's baseball legacy rests almost completely on the Shot, despite his\nother notable accomplishments, such as eight 20-home run seasons and three\n[All Star](/wiki/All-star_game \"All-star game\") selections. \"It was the best\nthing that ever happened to me\", he told a reporter toward the end of his\nlife. \"It may have been the best thing that ever happened to anybody.\"[40]\n\n###\nControversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Controversy\")]\n\nIn ensuing years, rumors began to circulate that during the second half of the\n1951 season, the Giants engaged in the systematic stealing of\n[signs](/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball#sign \"Glossary of baseball\")—the finger\nsignals transmitted from catcher to pitcher that determine the pitch to be\nthrown. The [Associated Press](/wiki/Associated_Press \"Associated Press\")\nreported the rumor in 1962, but with no specifics, and based on an anonymous\nsource.[41] In 2001, many of the 21 Giants players still alive at the time,\nand one surviving coach, told the _[Wall Street\nJournal](/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal \"Wall Street Journal\")_ that beginning on\nJuly 20, the team used a telescope in the Giants clubhouse behind center\nfield, manned by infielder [Hank Schenz](/wiki/Hank_Schenz \"Hank Schenz\") and\nlater by coach [Herman Franks](/wiki/Herman_Franks \"Herman Franks\"), to steal\nthe finger signals of opposing catchers. Stolen signs were relayed via a\nbuzzer wire connected from the clubhouse to telephones in the Giants\n[dugout](/wiki/Dugout_\\(baseball\\) \"Dugout \\(baseball\\)\") and\n[bullpen](/wiki/Bullpen \"Bullpen\")—one buzz for a fastball, two for an [off-\nspeed pitch](/wiki/Off-speed_pitch \"Off-speed pitch\"). \"Every hitter knew what\nwas coming,\" said pitcher [Al Gettel](/wiki/Al_Gettel \"Al Gettel\"). \"Made a\nbig difference.\"[41] [Joshua Prager](/wiki/Joshua_Prager_\\(writer\\) \"Joshua\nPrager \\(writer\\)\"), the author of the _Journal_ article, outlined the\nevidence in greater detail in a 2006 book.[42]\n\nAlthough backup catcher [Sal Yvars](/wiki/Sal_Yvars \"Sal Yvars\") told Prager\nthat he relayed Rube Walker's fastball sign to Thomson from the bullpen,\nThomson repeatedly insisted that he was concentrating on the situation, and\ndid not take the sign.[43] Branca made no public comment at the time. \"I made\na decision not to speak about it,\" he said. \"I didn't want to look like I was\ncrying over spilled milk.\"[41] Later he told _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ , \"I didn't want to\ndiminish a legendary moment in baseball. And even if Bobby knew what was\ncoming, he had to hit it ... Knowing the pitch doesn't always help.\"[44] In\nanother interview, Branca pointed out that luck and circumstance were involved\nas well; had the coin toss gone the other way, Thomson's Shot would not have\nbeen a home run at Ebbets Field—nor would the game-winner he hit in the first\nplayoff game have been a homer at the Polo Grounds.[9]\n\nWhether the telescope-and-buzzer system contributed significantly to the\nGiants' late-season 37–7 win streak remains a subject of debate.[45] Prager\nnotes in his book that sign stealing was not specifically forbidden by MLB\nrules at the time and, moral issues aside, \"...has been a part of baseball\nsince its inception\".[46] Sign stealing using optical or other mechanical aids\nwas outlawed by MLB in 1961.[43]\n\n##\nArtifacts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Artifacts\")]\n\nSome of the artifacts from the historic moment have been preserved. Thomson's\ngame bat and shoes are the centerpieces of an exhibit dedicated to the Shot at\nthe [National Baseball Hall of Fame and\nMuseum](/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum \"National Baseball\nHall of Fame and Museum\").[47] The exhibit is one of the Hall's most popular\nattractions, according to curators.[48]\n\nThomson's game jersey is most likely in the collection of Dan Scheinman, a\ncollector who owns a small minority stake in the Giants. In 2005, he bought\ntwo 1951 jerseys—one home and one road—from Thomson, who told him that he had\nworn them in the World Series, but could not remember whether he had worn the\nhome jersey for the Shot game. Scheinman has said that he is \"about 90\npercent\" confident that the home jersey is indeed the one Thomson was wearing\nwhen he hit the Shot: The Giants almost certainly wore the same uniforms for\nthe Series—which began the day after the Shot game—that they used during the\nsecond half of the season (as did the Yankees), and Scheinman's jersey\ndisplays distinct puckering around the numbers, probably as a result of steam\npressing, that is visible in photos of Thomson taken during and immediately\nafter the Shot game. According to a professional textile conservator, such\npuckering cannot be mimicked or reproduced, and would not repeat itself in\nexactly the same pattern on a different jersey.[48]\n\nThe location of the ball is unknown. Documentary filmmaker and author Brian\nBiegel attempted unsuccessfully to authenticate a vintage baseball,\nautographed by several 1951 Giants, that his father had purchased at a thrift\nstore for four dollars, and believed to be Thomson's home run ball. He\nchronicled the project in his 2011 book _Miracle Ball_ , followed by a\ndocumentary film of the same name.[47]\n\n##\nLegacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Legacy\")]\n\nThe Shot game placed second on [ESPN](/wiki/ESPN \"ESPN\")'s _SportsCentury_\nranking of the Ten Greatest Games of the 20th Century, behind the [1958 NFL\nChampionship Game](/wiki/1958_NFL_Championship_Game \"1958 NFL Championship\nGame\").[49] _[Sports Illustrated](/wiki/Sports_Illustrated \"Sports\nIllustrated\")_ ranked Thomson's home run fifteenth on its list of the 100\nGreatest Moments in Sports History.[50]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_\\(baseball\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Regan, Becky (August 9, 2007).
