The only known threat strong\nenough against the empire's power and plans is the legendary \"Defender of the\nUniverse\" Voltron, a 100-meter tall robot warrior composed of five lion mechas\nwhose pilots are known as the Paladins. At the crux of the war that ended with\nthe destruction of planet Altea, Voltron was separated by King Alfor of Altea\nin order to protect Voltron from falling into the Galran Emperor Zarkon's\npossession. King Alfor bonded the five lion's energies to his daughter\nAllura's life force and sent them across the universe to different locations\nuntil the time for the next generation of Paladins to appear and pilot Voltron\narrived. Princess Allura, her retainer Coran, and the Altean Castle of Lions\nwere hidden on planet Arus along with the Black Lion.\n\nIn the present, the Galra Empire's path of conquest and search for Voltron has\nled them to Earth's solar system. A group of space pilots – Shiro, Keith,\nLance, Pidge, and Hunk – discover the Blue Lion and immediately get swept up\ninto the Galran War. They meet Princess Allura, become Paladins, and reunite\nthe five lions to form Voltron to combat Emperor Zarkon's nefarious schemes,\nwith the hopes of ultimately defeating the entire Galra Empire.\n\n## Cast and\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Voltron:_Legendary_Defender&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast and characters\")]\n\nSee also: [List of Voltron characters](/wiki/List_of_Voltron_characters \"List\nof Voltron characters\")\n\n###\nMain[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Voltron:_Legendary_Defender&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Main\")]\n\n  * [Josh Keaton](/wiki/Josh_Keaton \"Josh Keaton\") as **Takashi \"Shiro\" Shirogane** \\- The Black Paladin, the pilot of the Black Lion and Guardian Spirit of Sky. The Leader of the Defenders of the Universe, Shiro was captured by the Galra Empire a year before the start of the series during which he was given a weaponized prosthetic right arm. A natural, decisive leader, Shiro is calm and always in control. At the end of season two, Shiro reclaims his personal bayard weapon from Zarkon that enables them to defeat him, but Shiro mysteriously vanishes afterwards. In season three, it is revealed he was teleported to a Galra ship, as he ended up on one before escaping and was eventually found by the team. After finding that the Black Lion no longer accepts him as its true paladin, he continues to aid the team by providing guidance and support to them from the Castle of the Lions. At the start of season four, Shiro manages to re-establish his bond with the Black Lion when Keith was absent during an intense battle. In season five, he has become an unwitting mole of Haggar, who can see through his eyes to keep an eye on Lotor.\n  * [Steven Yeun](/wiki/Steven_Yeun \"Steven Yeun\") as **Keith** \\- The Red Paladin, the pilot of the Red Lion and Guardian Spirit of Fire. Formerly a cadet at Galaxy Garrison academy before being expelled, Keith is an [orphan](/wiki/Orphan \"Orphan\") and a lone wolf as a result. Sullen and temperamental, Keith spends his free time honing his skills for battle. In season two, Keith discovers he has Galra blood, apparently from his maternal side of the family. The revelation comes from a knife which associated him with a secret rebel group of the Galra called the \"Blade of Marmora,\" but also ends up straining Allura's trust in him for a while. Due to Shiro's absence, Keith takes over as the head of Voltron as the new pilot of the Black Lion in season three. At the start of season four, Keith officially steps down as the leader of Voltron, handing the position back to Shiro so that he can continue to work with the Blade of Marmora. At the end of season five, Keith is reunited with the Galra who is his mother.\n  * [Jeremy Shada](/wiki/Jeremy_Shada \"Jeremy Shada\") as **Lance** \\- The Blue Paladin, the pilot of the Blue Lion and Guardian Spirit of Water. Lance was the fighter pilot of his team at Galaxy Garrison academy. Cocky and confident, Lance is the comic relief of the Defenders and likes to think of himself as a ladies' man as well as the sharpshooter. Lance has maintained a one-sided rivalry with Keith from when the two were at the Galaxy Garrison together, but the two have shown to be an effective team. Lance takes over piloting the Red Lion in season three.\n  * [Bex Taylor-Klaus](/wiki/Bex_Taylor-Klaus \"Bex Taylor-Klaus\") as **Katie \"Pidge\" Holt** \\- The Green Paladin, the pilot of the Green Lion and Guardian Spirit of Forest. Katie disguised herself as a boy named Pidge Gunderson to get into Galaxy Garrison academy to find out what happened to her father and brother who disappeared whilst on the same mission which Shiro was captured on. A technical genius, Pidge is the smartest member of the team able to create specialist modifications for the Green Lion such as a cloaking device (which only lasts thirty seconds) and she re-purposed a Galran drone to work for her, naming it Rover, who later sacrifice itself to protect her. During her time as a Paladin, she eventually rescues her family and while her brother, Matt keeps fighting for the alliance, her father returns to Earth to warn the Galaxy Garrison about the war against the Galra.\n  * [Tyler Labine](/wiki/Tyler_Labine \"Tyler Labine\") as **Hunk** \\- The Yellow Paladin, the pilot of the Yellow Lion and Guardian Spirit of Land. Hunk was the engineer of his team at Galaxy Garrison academy. A gentle giant with an equally large appetite, Hunk is the heart of the team, lifting them up and making peace between them. After witnessing first hand the devastation and misery that Zarkon's conquest of the universe has brought upon the people of various worlds, Hunk is determined to free those enslaved.\n  * [Kimberly Brooks](/wiki/Kimberly_Brooks \"Kimberly Brooks\") as **Princess Allura** \\- Crown Princess of Altea, the daughter of King Alfor, Allura is the last known female Altean. Pilot and keeper of the Castle of Lions, a structure that is both a castle and a spaceship, Allura granted the Defenders their titles and sent them on their mission to defeat Zarkon and liberate the universe. Allura wishes more than anything to finish her father's work in stopping Zarkon. In season three, she becomes the new pilot of the Blue Lion as the Pink Paladin. As an Altean, Allura's abilities include the chameleon-like ability to blend in with other species and magical abilities related to quintessence. She has a telepathic bond with some Altean mice that had ended up in the same cryo-pod that she was hibernating inside of.\n  * [Rhys Darby](/wiki/Rhys_Darby \"Rhys Darby\") as **Coran** \\- The Royal advisor to Princess Allura's family and the last known male Altean. Energetic and excitable, Coran serves Allura dutifully whilst being fiercely protective of her. He tends to ramble on and on about his past, particularly about his supposedly daring feats or past experiences. Despite his odd and quirky character, he is a reliable and steadfast ally to his princess and the Paladins.\n  * [Neil Kaplan](/wiki/Neil_Kaplan \"Neil Kaplan\") as **Emperor Zarkon** \\- The Emperor of the ruthless Galra Empire, and the ruler of most of the known universe after spending the last ten thousand years conquering it. He desires the Lions of Voltron, not only because they represent the biggest threat to his campaign, but because he is later revealed to be the former Black Paladin. As such, he views the Lions as his own property rather than seeing himself as a former chosen one to pilot the Black Lion. He is powerful enough to go toe-to-toe directly with the Lions themselves. At the end of season two, Zarkon faces Voltron and the Paladins in an experimental mecha armor and is defeated but left in critical condition, unconscious and requiring life-support. By the end of season three, his history is fully revealed and Haggar successfully reawakens him and he starts a manhunt for Lotor. In season five, Lotor seems to have killed him in a duel to the death, and he is declared dead by the empire.\n  * [Cree Summer](/wiki/Cree_Summer \"Cree Summer\") as **Witch Haggar** \\- Zarkon's primary advisor, and leader of the Druids, dark mystics who fanatically serve the Galra Empire. Haggar is both a dangerous sorceress and a mad scientist. She combines her unnatural magic with abominable science to arm Galra soldiers with powerful weapons, create terrible monsters (dubbed \"Ro-beasts\" in the second season) to fight Voltron, and leech all manner of living things, including entire planets, of the mystical energy known as Quintessence for the Galra to use in their conquest of the universe. In battle, her magical abilities allow her to teleport, cast illusions, fog the minds of others with hallucinations, and use her hands to project energy blasts and shields. Haggar is revealed to be Altean in the second-season finale, and after Zarkon's defeat, orders the remaining Galran commanders to summon their lord's son, Prince Lotor. By the end of season three, she is revealed to be Honerva, an Altean alchemist and wife to Zarkon before both of them were corrupted by dark creatures, that are linked to Voltron's origins, ten thousand years ago. Haggar seemed to have lost her memory of her former life, only recently discovering this knowledge with her magic and using it to gradually recover the rest of her memories, learning that Prince Lotor is her own son.\n  * [A.J. Locascio](/wiki/A.J._Locascio \"A.J. Locascio\") as **Prince Lotor** \\- The son of Zarkon and Honerva (Witch Haggar) and heir to the Galra Empire, who assumes control of the Galra following his father's defeat. Lotor follows a different philosophy than other Galra, believing that strength comes from bringing in worthy followers from the worlds they conquer rather than expending further resources to keep them subjugated. He has a personal all-female strike team consisting of individuals who are, like himself, only half-Galra. During his leadership of the Galra, he ignores matters that he deems a waste of time. It is eventually revealed that he has been working on his own plans to obtain Quintessence, and as a result, Zarkon declares him an outlaw. At the end of season 4, he provides assistance to the Paladins, saving them from an ambush by Haggar and offers an alliance with them. In season 5, Lotor defeats his father in a fight to the death and assumes control of the Empire, while forming an alliance with the Paladins and dealing with insurgents who question his authority.\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Voltron:_Legendary_Defender&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nOn January 5, 2016, [Netflix](/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\") and [DreamWorks\nAnimation](/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation \"DreamWorks Animation\") announced a new\noriginal animated _Voltron_ series to debut in 2016 as an expansion of their\nexisting multi-year agreement.[10] _Voltron_ is one of several series planned\nfor initial development and debut in 2016, including [Guillermo del\nToro](/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro \"Guillermo del Toro\")'s animated\n_[Trollhunters](/wiki/Trollhunters \"Trollhunters\")_.[11] [Lauren\nMontgomery](/wiki/Lauren_Montgomery \"Lauren Montgomery\") and [Joaquim Dos\nSantos](/wiki/Joaquim_Dos_Santos \"Joaquim Dos Santos\"), both known for their\nwork on the _[Avatar: The Last Airbender](/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender\n\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\")_ and its sequel _[The Legend of\nKorra](/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra \"The Legend of Korra\")_ , served as\nshowrunners while fellow crew member Tim Hedrick served as head writer.[12] On\nMarch 25, 2016, at WonderCon it was announced that the voice cast would\nconsist of [Steven Yeun](/wiki/Steven_Yeun \"Steven Yeun\") as Keith, [Jeremy\nShada](/wiki/Jeremy_Shada \"Jeremy Shada\") as Lance, [Bex Taylor-\nKlaus](/wiki/Bex_Taylor-Klaus \"Bex Taylor-Klaus\") as Pidge, [Josh\nKeaton](/wiki/Josh_Keaton \"Josh Keaton\") as Shiro, [Tyler\nLabine](/wiki/Tyler_Labine \"Tyler Labine\") as Hunk, [Kimberly\nBrooks](/wiki/Kimberly_Brooks \"Kimberly Brooks\") as Princess Allura; and [Rhys\nDarby](/wiki/Rhys_Darby \"Rhys Darby\") as Coran and [Neil\nKaplan](/wiki/Neil_Kaplan \"Neil Kaplan\") as King Zarkon.[13] [Cree\nSummer](/wiki/Cree_Summer \"Cree Summer\") later confirmed that she would be\nvoicing Witch Haggar.[14]\n\nIt was announced at [San Diego Comic-Con](/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con \"San Diego\nComic-Con\") that season two will premiere on Netflix in late 2016.[15] A few\nmonths later, at [New York Comic Con](/wiki/New_York_Comic_Con \"New York Comic\nCon\"), it was announced that the second season will premiere on January 20,\n2017.[3] The second season saw a special premiere at the New York Comic Con in\nOctober 7, 2016, where an episode was shown at the _Voltron_ panel.[16] The\nsecond season premiered on Netflix on January 20, 2017, and consisted of 13\nepisodes.[3]\n\nThe third season premiered on Netflix on August 4, 2017, and consisted of 7\nepisodes.
