Today they are supported by the [POSIX](/wiki/POSIX \"POSIX\") operating\nsystem standard, most [Unix-like](/wiki/Unix-like \"Unix-like\") [operating\nsystems](/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\") such as\n[FreeBSD](/wiki/FreeBSD \"FreeBSD\"), [Linux](/wiki/Linux \"Linux\"), and [Mac OS\nX](/wiki/Mac_OS_X \"Mac OS X\"). Limited support also exists in Windows\noperating systems such as [Windows Vista](/wiki/Windows_Vista \"Windows\nVista\"), [Windows 7](/wiki/Windows_7 \"Windows 7\") and to some degree in\n[Windows 2000](/wiki/Windows_2000 \"Windows 2000\") and [Windows\nXP](/wiki/Windows_XP \"Windows XP\") in the form of [shortcut\nfiles](/wiki/File_shortcut \"File shortcut\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Overview\n  * 2 POSIX and Unix-like operating systems\n    * 2.1 Storage of symbolic links\n    * 2.2 Mac OS aliases\n  * 3 Microsoft Windows\n    * 3.1 NTFS symbolic link\n    * 3.2 NTFS junction points\n    * 3.3 Shortcuts\n    * 3.4 Folder shortcuts\n    * 3.5 Shell objects\n    * 3.6 Cygwin symbolic links\n    * 3.7 Summary\n  * 4 Amiga\n  * 5 OS/2\n  * 6 Variable symbolic links\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Overview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\nA symbolic link contains a text string that is automatically interpreted and\nfollowed by the operating system as a path to another file or directory. This\nother file or directory is called the \"target\". The symbolic link is a second\nfile that exists independently of its target. If a symbolic link is deleted,\nits target remains unaffected. If a symbolic link points to a target, and\nsometime later that target is moved, renamed or deleted, the symbolic link is\nnot automatically updated or deleted, but continues to exist and still points\nto the old target, now a non-existing location or file. Symbolic links\npointing to moved or non-existing targets are sometimes called _broken_ ,\n_orphaned_ , _dead_ , or _dangling_.\n\nSymbolic links are different from [hard links](/wiki/Hard_link \"Hard link\").\nHard links do not link paths on different [volumes](/wiki/Volume_\\(computing\\)\n\"Volume \\(computing\\)\") or [file systems](/wiki/File_system_API \"File system\nAPI\"), whereas symbolic links may point to any file or directory irrespective\nof the [volumes](/wiki/Volume_\\(computing\\) \"Volume \\(computing\\)\") on which\nthe link and target reside. Hard links always refer to an existing file,\nwhereas symbolic links may contain an arbitrary path that does not point to\nanything.\n\nSymbolic links operate transparently for many operations: programs that read\nor write to files named by a symbolic link will behave as if operating\ndirectly on the target file. However, they have the effect of changing an\notherwise hierarchical filesystem from a [tree](/wiki/Tree_\\(graph_theory\\)\n\"Tree \\(graph theory\\)\") into a [directed graph](/wiki/Directed_graph\n\"Directed graph\"), which can have consequences for such simple operations as\nfiguring out the current directory of a process. Even the Unix .. convention\nfor navigating to a directory's parent directory no longer works reliably in\nthe face of symlinks. Some [shells](/wiki/Unix_shell \"Unix shell\")\n[heuristically](/wiki/Heuristic \"Heuristic\") try to uphold the illusion of a\ntree-shaped hierarchy, but when they do, this causes them to produce different\nresults from other programs that manipulate pathnames without such heuristic,\nrelying on the operating system instead.[2] Programs that need to handle\nsymbolic links specially (e.g., shells and backup utilities) thus need to\nidentify and manipulate them directly.\n\nSome Unix as well as Linux distributions use symbolic links extensively in an\neffort to reorder the [file system](/wiki/File_system \"File system\")\nhierarchy. This is accomplished with several mechanisms, such as variant,\ncontext-dependent symbolic links. This offers the opportunity to create a more\nintuitive or application-specific [directory tree](/wiki/Directory_tree\n\"Directory tree\") and to reorganize the system without having to redesign the\ncore set of system functions and utilities.\n\n## POSIX and Unix-like operating\nsystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: POSIX and Unix-like operating systems\")]\n\nIn [POSIX](/wiki/POSIX \"POSIX\")-compliant operating systems, symbolic links\nare created with the `symlink`[3] system call. The `[ln](/wiki/Ln_\\(Unix\\) \"Ln\n\\(Unix\\)\")` shell command normally uses the `link`[4] system call, which\ncreates a [hard link](/wiki/Hard_link \"Hard link\"). When the `ln _-s_` flag is\nspecified, the symlink() system call is used instead, creating a symbolic\nlink. Symlinks were introduced in [4.2BSD\nUnix](/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution \"Berkeley Software Distribution\")\nfrom [U.C. Berkeley](/wiki/Computer_Systems_Research_Group \"Computer Systems\nResearch Group\").\n\nThe following command creates a symbolic link at the [command-line\ninterface](/wiki/Command-line_interface \"Command-line interface\") (shell):\n\n    \n    \n     ln -s target_path link_path\n    \n\n`target_path` is the relative or absolute path to which the symbolic link\nshould point. Usually the target will exist, although symbolic links may be\ncreated to non-existent targets. `link_path` is the path of the symbolic link.\n\nAfter creating the symbolic link, it may generally be treated as an alias for\nthe target. Any file system management commands (e.g., `[cp](/wiki/Cp_\\(Unix\\)\n\"Cp \\(Unix\\)\")`, `[rm](/wiki/Rm_\\(Unix\\) \"Rm \\(Unix\\)\")`) may be used on the\nsymbolic link. Commands which read or write file contents will access the\ncontents of the target file. The `rm` (delete file) command, however, removes\nthe link itself, not the target file.\n\nThe POSIX directory listing application, `[ls](/wiki/Ls \"Ls\")`, denotes\nsymbolic links with an arrow after the name, pointing to the name of the\ntarget file (see following example), when the long directory list is requested\n(`-l` option). When a directory listing of a symbolic link that points to a\ndirectory is requested, only the link itself will be displayed. In order to\nobtain a listing of the linked directory, the path must include a trailing\ndirectory separator character ('/', slash).\n\nNote: In Below Example do not create \"three\" directory before creation of link\nin /tmp directory.\n\n    \n    \n    $ mkdir -p /tmp/one/two\n    $ echo \"test_a\" >/tmp/one/two/a\n    $ echo \"test_b\" >/tmp/one/two/b\n    $ cd /tmp/one/two\n    $ ls -l\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 a\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 b\n    \n    $ cd /tmp\n    $ ln -s /tmp/one/two three\n    $ ls -l three\n    lrwxrwxrwx 1 user group 12 Jul 22 10:02 /tmp/three -> /tmp/one/two\n    $ ls -l three/\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 a\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 b\n    \n    $ cd three\n    $ ls -l\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 a\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 b\n    $ cat a\n    test_a\n    $ cat /tmp/one/two/a\n    test_a\n    $ echo \"test_c\" >/tmp/one/two/a\n    $ cat /tmp/one/two/a\n    test_c\n    $ cat a\n    test_c\n    \n\n### Storage of symbolic\nlinks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Storage of symbolic links\")]\n\nEarly implementations of symbolic links stored the symbolic link information\nas data in regular files. The file contained the textual reference to the\nlink’s target, and an indicator[_[clarification\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_] denoting\nit as a symbolic link.\n\nThis method was slow and an inefficient use of [disk-space](/wiki/Disk_storage\n\"Disk storage\") on small systems. An improvement, called **fast symlinks** ,\nallowed storage of the target path within the [data\nstructures](/wiki/Data_structure \"Data structure\") used for storing file\ninformation on disk ([inodes](/wiki/Inode \"Inode\")). This space normally\nstores a list of disk [block](/wiki/Block_\\(data_storage\\) \"Block \\(data\nstorage\\)\") addresses allocated to a file. Thus, symlinks with short target\npaths are accessed quickly. Systems with fast symlinks often fall back to\nusing the original method if the target path exceeds the available inode\nspace. The original style is [retroactively termed](/wiki/Retronym \"Retronym\")\na **slow symlink**. It is also used for disk compatibility with other or older\nversions of operating systems.\n\nAlthough storing the link value inside the inode saves a disk block and a disk\nread, the operating system still needs to parse the path name in the link,\nwhich always requires reading additional inodes and generally requires reading\nother, and potentially many, directories, processing both the list of files\nand the inodes of each of them until it finds a match with the link's path\ncomponents. Only when a link points to a file in the same directory do \"fast\nsymlinks\" provide significantly better performance than other symlinks.\n\nThe vast majority of POSIX-compliant implementations use fast symlinks.\nHowever, the [POSIX](/wiki/POSIX \"POSIX\") standard does not require the entire\nset of file status information common to regular files to be implemented for\nsymlinks. This allows implementations to use other solutions, such as storing\nsymlink data in directory entries.\n\nThe [file system permissions](/wiki/File_system_permissions \"File system\npermissions\") of a symbolic link are not used, the access modes of the target\nfile are controlled by the target file's own permissions. Some operating\nsystems, such as FreeBSD, offer the ability to modify file permissions and\nfilesystem attributes of a symbolic link, through `lchmod`[5] and\n`lchflags`[6] system calls respectively.\n\nThe reported size of a symlink is the number of characters in the path it\npoints to.\n\n### Mac OS\naliases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Mac OS aliases\")]\n\nMain article: [Alias (Mac OS)](/wiki/Alias_\\(Mac_OS\\) \"Alias \\(Mac OS\\)\")\n\nIn Mac OS, applications or users can also employ\n_[aliases](/wiki/Alias_\\(Mac_OS\\) \"Alias \\(Mac OS\\)\")_ , which have the added\nfeature of following the target, even if it is moved to another location on\nthe same volume. This is not to be confused with the shell command\n[alias](/wiki/Alias_\\(command\\) \"Alias \\(command\\)\").\n\n## Microsoft\nWindows[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Microsoft Windows\")]\n\n### NTFS symbolic\nlink[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: NTFS symbolic link\")]\n\nMain article: [NTFS symbolic link](/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link \"NTFS symbolic\nlink\")\n\n[NTFS](/wiki/NTFS \"NTFS\") 3.1 introduced support symbolic links for any type\nof file. It was included with [Windows XP](/wiki/Windows_XP \"Windows XP\"), but\nwas only enabled by default for kernel mode programs; [Windows\nVista](/wiki/Windows_Vista \"Windows Vista\") and later versions of Windows\nenabled support for symbolic links to user mode applications, as well, and\nsupplied the command line utility `mklink` for creating them. Third-party\ndrivers are required to enable support for NTFS symbolic links in Windows\nXP.[7] Unlike [junction points](/wiki/NTFS_junction_point \"NTFS junction\npoint\"), a symbolic link can also point to a file or remote [Server Message\nBlock](/wiki/Server_Message_Block \"Server Message Block\") (SMB) network path.\nAdditionally, the NTFS symbolic link implementation provides full support for\ncross-filesystem links. However, the functionality enabling cross-host\nsymbolic links requires that the remote system also support them.\n\nSymbolic links are designed to aid in migration and application compatibility\nwith [POSIX](/wiki/POSIX \"POSIX\") operating systems. Microsoft aimed for\nWindows Vista's symbolic links to \"function just like UNIX links\".[8] However,\nthe implementation varies from Unix symbolic links in several ways. For\nexample, Windows Vista users must manually indicate when creating a symbolic\nlink whether it is a file or a directory.[9] Windows 7 and Vista support a\nmaximum of 31 [reparse points](/wiki/Reparse_point \"Reparse point\") (and\ntherefore symbolic links) for a given path (i.e. any given path can have at\nmost 31 indirections before Windows gives up).[10] Only users with the new\n_Create Symbolic Link_ privilege, which only administrators have by default,\ncan create symbolic links.[11] If this is not the desired behavior, it must be\nchanged in the Local Security Policy management console. Additionally, NTFS\nsymbolic links to files are distinct from NTFS symbolic links to directories\nand therefore cannot be used interchangeably, unlike on POSIX where the same\nsymbolic link can refer to either files or directories.\n\nIn Windows Vista and later, when the working directory path ends with a\nsymbolic link, the current parent path reference, `..`, will refer to the\nparent directory of the symbolic link rather than that of its target. This\nbehaviour is also found at the shell level in at least some POSIX systems,\nincluding [Linux](/wiki/Linux \"Linux\"), but never in accessing files and\ndirectories through operating system calls. For instance, bash builtin\ncommands `pwd` and `cd` operate on the current logical directory. `pwd` is\noften used in scripts to determine the actual current working directory. When\nany path is used with a system call, any use of `..` will use the actual\nfilesystem parent of the directory containing the `..` pseudo-directory entry.\nSo, `cd ..; cat something` and `cat ../something` may return completely\ndifferent results.\n\nExample:\n\n    \n    \n    mklink /D \"C:\\Users\\<yourusername>\\Appdata\\Local\\Plex Media Server\" \"G:\\Plex Media Server\"\n    \n\n### NTFS junction\npoints[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: NTFS junction points\")]\n\nMain article: [NTFS junction point](/wiki/NTFS_junction_point \"NTFS junction\npoint\")\n\nThe [Windows 2000](/wiki/Windows_2000 \"Windows 2000\") version of\n[NTFS](/wiki/NTFS \"NTFS\") introduced [reparse points](/wiki/NTFS_reparse_point\n\"NTFS reparse point\"), which enabled, among other things, the use of [Volume\nMount Points](/wiki/Volume_Mount_Point \"Volume Mount Point\") and junction\npoints. Junction points are for directories only, and moreover, local\ndirectories only; junction points to remote shares are unsupported.[12] The\nWindows 2000 and XP Resource Kits include a program called linkd to create\njunction points; a more powerful one named Junction was distributed by\n[Sysinternals](/wiki/Sysinternals \"Sysinternals\")' [Mark\nRussinovich](/wiki/Mark_Russinovich \"Mark Russinovich\").\n\nNot all standard applications support reparse points. Most noticeably, Backup\nsuffers from this problem and will issue an error message 0x80070003[13] when\nthe folders to be backed up contain a reparse point.\n\n### Shortcuts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Shortcuts\")]\n\n[Shortcuts](/wiki/Computer_shortcut \"Computer shortcut\"), which are supported\nby the graphical file browsers of some operating systems, may resemble\nsymbolic links but differ in a number of important ways. One difference is\nwhat type of software is able to follow them:\n\n  * Symbolic links are automatically resolved by the file system. Any software program, upon accessing a symbolic link, will see the target instead, whether the program is aware of symbolic links or not.\n  * Shortcuts are treated like ordinary files by the file system and by software programs that are not aware of them. Only software programs that understand shortcuts (such as the Windows shell and file browsers) treat them as references to other files.\n\nAnother difference are the capabilities of the mechanism:\n\n  * [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\") shortcuts normally refer to a destination by an [absolute path](/wiki/Absolute_path \"Absolute path\") (starting from the [root directory](/wiki/Root_directory \"Root directory\")), whereas POSIX symbolic links can refer to destinations via either an absolute or a [relative path](/wiki/Relative_path \"Relative path\"). The latter is useful if both the location and destination of the symbolic link share a common path [prefix](/wiki/Prefix \"Prefix\"), but that prefix is not yet known when the symbolic link is created (e.g., in an [archive file](/wiki/Archive_file \"Archive file\") that can be unpacked anywhere).\n  * Microsoft Windows application shortcuts contain additional metadata that can be associated with the destination, whereas POSIX symbolic links are just strings that will be interpreted as absolute or relative pathnames.\n  * Unlike symbolic links, Windows shortcuts maintain their references to their targets even when the target is moved or renamed. Windows domain clients may subscribe to a [Windows service](/wiki/Windows_service \"Windows service\") called _[Distributed Link Tracking](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc778822%28v=ws.10%29.aspx)_ to track the changes in files and folders to which they are interested. The service maintains the integrity of shortcuts, even when files and folders are moved across the network.[14] Additionally, in Windows 9x and later, [Windows shell](/wiki/Windows_shell \"Windows shell\") tries to find the target of a broken shortcut before proposing to delete it.\n\n### Folder\nshortcuts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Folder shortcuts\")]\n\nAlmost like shortcuts, but transparent to the Windows shell.[15] They are\nimplemented as ordinary folders (which need to have the _read only_ and/or\n_system_ attribute[16]) containing a shortcut named _target.lnk_ which refers\nto the target and a (hidden) _desktop.ini_ with (at least) the following\ncontents:\n\n    \n    \n     [.ShellClassInfo]\n     CLSID2={0AFACED1-E828-11D1-9187-B532F1E9575D}\n    \n\nFolder shortcuts are created and used from the Windows shell in the _network\nneighborhood_ for example.\n\n### Shell\nobjects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Shell objects\")]\n\nThe _shell objects_[17] or _shell folders_ are defined in the Windows registry\nand can be used to implement a sort of symbolic link too. Like folder\nshortcuts, they are transparent to the Windows shell.\n\nA minimal implementation is (the CLSID\n_{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}_ is used as a placeholder):\n\n    \n    \n     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID\\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}]\n     @=\"display name\"\n     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID\\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\\DefaultIcon]\n     @=\"...\" ; path to icon\n     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID\\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\\InProcServer32]\n     @=\"%SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\ShDocVw.Dll\"\n     \"ThreadingModel\"=\"Apartment\"\n     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID\\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\\Instance]\n     \"CLSID\"=\"{0AFACED1-E828-11D1-9187-B532F1E9575D}\"\n     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID\\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\\Instance\\InitPropertyBag]\n     \"Attributes\"=hex:15,00,00,00\n     \"Target\"=\"...\" ; absolute (WITHOUT \"TargetKnownFolder\" or \"TargetSpecialFolder\" only)\n                    ; or relative path to target\n     \"TargetKnownFolder\"=\"{guidguid-guid-guid-guid-guidguidguid}\" ; GUID of target folder, Windows Vista and later\n     \"TargetSpecialFolder\"=\"0x00xy\" ; CSIDL of target\n     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\CLSID\\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\\ShellFolder]\n     \"Attributes\"=hex:00,00,00,00\n    \n\nThe _My Documents_ folder on the _Desktop_ as well as the _Fonts_ and the\n_Administrative Tools_ folders in the _Control Panel_ are examples of _shell\nobjects_ redirected to file-system folders.\n\n### Cygwin symbolic\nlinks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Cygwin symbolic links\")]\n\n[Cygwin](/wiki/Cygwin \"Cygwin\") simulates POSIX-compliant symbolic links in\nthe Microsoft Windows file system. It uses identical programming and user\nutility interfaces as Unix (see above), but creates Windows shortcuts (.lnk\nfiles) with additional information used by Cygwin at the time of symlink\nresolution. Cygwin symlinks are compliant with both Windows and the POSIX\nstandard.[_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\n\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_]\n\nAdditionally, Cygwin can be set up to support native Windows symbolic links\nwhich can be used out of Cygwin without restrictions.[18] This requires:\n\n  1. Editing CYGWIN variable (or use another way to set Cygwin option);\n  2. Running the Cygwin with elevated rights because Windows restricts the creation of symbolic links to privileged users\n\nSome differences exist, however. Cygwin has no way to specify shortcut-related\ninformation – such as working directory or icon – as there is no place for\nsuch parameters in `ln -s` command. To create standard Microsoft .lnk files\nCygwin provides the `mkshortcut` and `readshortcut` utilities[19]\n\nThe Cygwin User's Guide[20] has more information on this topic.\n\n### Summary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Summary\")]\n\nProperty/Action | Symbolic link | [Junction](/wiki/NTFS_junction_point \"NTFS junction point\") | [Hard link](/wiki/Hard_link \"Hard link\")  \n---|---|---|---  \nWhen the link is deleted | Target remains unchanged | Target is deleted (except when using special tools) | Reference counter is decremented; when it reaches 0, the target is deleted  \nWhen target is moved | Symbolic link becomes invalid | Junction becomes invalid | Hard link remains valid  \nRelative path | Allowed | Not allowed (on saving, becomes an absolute path) | N/A  \nCrossing filesystem boundaries | Supported | Supported | Not supported (target must be on same filesystem)  \n[Windows](/wiki/Windows \"Windows\") | For files | Windows Vista and later[21]  \n(administrator rights required) | No | Yes  \nFor folders | Yes | No  \n[Unix](/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") | For files | Yes | N/A | Yes  \nFor directories | Yes | N/A | Partial[22]  \n  \n## Amiga[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Amiga\")]\n\nThe command creating symbolic links is `makelink`, which is also used for hard\nlinks. Internally the dos.library returns an error code indicating that a\ntarget is a soft link if you try to perform actions on it that are only legal\nfor a file, and applications that wish to follow the symbolic link then needs\nto explicitly make a call to follow the link and retry the operation. The\n[AmigaDOS](/wiki/AmigaDOS \"AmigaDOS\") shell will follow links automatically.\n\n## OS/2[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: OS/2\")]\n\nIn the [OS/2](/wiki/OS/2 \"OS/2\") operating system, symbolic links somewhat\nresemble [shadows](/wiki/Shadow_\\(OS/2\\) \"Shadow \\(OS/2\\)\") in the graphical\n[Workplace Shell](/wiki/Workplace_Shell \"Workplace Shell\"). However, shadows,\ndue to the fully object-oriented System Object Model, are considerably more\npowerful and robust than a simple link. For example, shadows do not lose their\ncapabilities when renamed or when either the object or subject of the link is\nrelocated.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Variable symbolic\nlinks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Variable symbolic links\")]\n\nSymbolic links may be implemented in a context-dependent or variable fashion,\nsuch that the link points to varying targets depending on a configuration\nparameter, run-time parameter, or other instantaneous condition.\n\nA _variable_ or _variant symbolic link_ is a symbolic link that has a variable\nname embedded in it. This allows some flexibility in filesystem order that is\nnot possible with a standard symbolic link. Variables embedded in a symbolic\nlink may include user and environment specific information.\n\n[Operating systems](/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\") that make use\nof variant symbolic links include [FreeBSD](/wiki/FreeBSD \"FreeBSD\"),\n[NetBSD](/wiki/NetBSD \"NetBSD\"), [DragonFly BSD](/wiki/DragonFly_BSD\n\"DragonFly BSD\"), [Domain/OS](/wiki/Domain/OS \"Domain/OS\").[23]\n\n[Tru64](/wiki/Tru64 \"Tru64\") uses a _context dependent symbolic link_ where\nthe context is the cluster member number.\n\n[Pyramid Technology](/wiki/Pyramid_Technology \"Pyramid Technology\")'s OSx\n[Operating System](/wiki/Operating_System \"Operating System\") implemented\n_conditional symbolic links_ which pointed to different locations depending on\nwhich [universe](/wiki/Universe_\\(Unix\\) \"Universe \\(Unix\\)\") a program was\nrunning in. The universes supported were [AT&T](/wiki/AT%26T_Corporation \"AT&T\nCorporation\")'s [SysV.3](/wiki/UNIX_System_V \"UNIX System V\") and the\n[Berkeley Software Distribution](/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution\n\"Berkeley Software Distribution\") (BSD 4.3). For example: if the\n[ps](/wiki/Ps_\\(Unix\\) \"Ps \\(Unix\\)\") command was run in the _att_ universe,\nthen the symbolic link for the directory _/bin_ would point to _/.attbin_ and\nthe program _/.attbin/ps_ would be executed. Whereas if the ps command was run\nin the _ucb_ universe, then _/bin_ would point to _/.ucbbin_ and _/.ucbbin/ps_\nwould be executed. Similar Conditional Symbolic Links were also created for\nother directories such as _/lib_ , _/usr/lib_ , _/usr/include_.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Symlink race](/wiki/Symlink_race \"Symlink race\") — a security-vulnerability caused by symbolic links\n  * [freedup](/wiki/Freedup \"Freedup\") — generates links between identical data automatically\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_link&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Pathname resolution](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_11), [POSIX](/wiki/POSIX \"POSIX\").\n  2. **Jump up ^** [Pike, Rob](/wiki/Rob_Pike \"Rob Pike\") (2000).
