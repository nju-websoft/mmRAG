        "# Rail Budget\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**Rail Budget of India** was the Annual Financial Statement of the state-owned\n[Indian Railways](/wiki/Indian_Railways \"Indian Railways\"), which handles\n[rail transport in India](/wiki/Rail_transport_in_India \"Rail transport in\nIndia\"). It was presented every year by the [Minister of\nRailways](/wiki/Minister_of_Railways_\\(India\\) \"Minister of Railways\n\\(India\\)\"), representing the [Ministry of\nRailways](/wiki/Ministry_of_Railways_\\(India\\) \"Ministry of Railways\n\\(India\\)\"), in the [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_India \"Parliament of\nIndia\").\n\nThe Railway Budget was presented every year, a few days before the [Union\nbudget](/wiki/Union_budget_of_India \"Union budget of India\"), till 2016. [Modi\ngovernment](/wiki/Modi_government \"Modi government\") on 21 September 2016\napproved merger of the Rail and [General budgets](/wiki/Union_budget_of_India\n\"Union budget of India\") from next year, ending a 92-year-old practice of a\nseparate budget for the nation’s largest transporter. Railways Minister\n[Suresh Prabhu](/wiki/Suresh_Prabhu \"Suresh Prabhu\") said that his merger\nproposal was in the long term interest of railways as well as the country’s\neconomy.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 References\n  * 4 Further reading\n  * 5 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rail_Budget&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Acworth Committee in 1920-21, headed by\nBritish railway economist [William Acworth](/wiki/William_Mitchell_Acworth\n\"William Mitchell Acworth\")[2] The \"Acworth Report\" led to reorganisation of\nrailways, the railway finances were separated from the general government\nfinances in 1921. After that in 1924 the budget was announced, a practice that\ncontinued till 2016.[3][4][5]\n\nJohn Mathai presented the first Railway Budget for independent India in\nNovember 1947.\n\nThe first live telecast took place on 24 March 1994.\n\n[Lalu Prasad Yadav](/wiki/Lalu_Prasad_Yadav \"Lalu Prasad Yadav\"), who remained\nRailways Minister from 2004 to May 2009, presented the railway budget 6 times\nin a row. In 2009, under his tenure a ₹108 billion (US$1.7 billion) budget was\npassed.[6]\n\nIn the year 2000, [Mamata Banerjee](/wiki/Mamata_Banerjee \"Mamata Banerjee\")\n(later [Chief Minister](/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_West_Bengal \"Chief Minister of\nWest Bengal\") of [West Bengal](/wiki/West_Bengal \"West Bengal\")) became the\nfirst female [Railway Minister](/wiki/Minister_of_Railways_\\(India\\) \"Minister\nof Railways \\(India\\)\"). In 2002, she became the first female to present the\nRailway budget and is the only woman to do so for two different governing\ncoalitions ([NDA](/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance_\\(India\\) \"National\nDemocratic Alliance \\(India\\)\") and [UPA](/wiki/United_Progressive_Alliance\n\"United Progressive Alliance\")).\n\nIn 2014 budget, Railway Minister [D. V. Sadananda\nGowda](/wiki/D._V._Sadananda_Gowda \"D. V. Sadananda Gowda\") announced the\nfirst [bullet train](/wiki/Shinkansen \"Shinkansen\") and 9 [High-Speed Rail\nroutes](/wiki/High-speed_rail_in_India \"High-speed rail in India\").[7]\n\nThe last [Railway Budget](/wiki/Railway_Budget \"Railway Budget\") [8] was\npresented on 25 February 2016 by Mr. [Suresh Prabhu](/wiki/Suresh_Prabhu\n\"Suresh Prabhu\").\n\nAlso, according to [Mid-day](/wiki/Mid_Day \"Mid Day\"), a mumbai centric local\ntabloid newspaper, [railway minister](/wiki/Minister_of_Railways_\\(India\\)\n\"Minister of Railways \\(India\\)\") [Piyush Goyal](/wiki/Piyush_Goyal \"Piyush\nGoyal\") is planning to introduce 210 air-conditioned suburban local trains and\nconvert the existing fleet into closed-door, cool trains at the cost of\nR16,3809 crore in the Rail Budget of 2018 which is to be presented on 1st\nFebruary 2018.[9]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rail_Budget&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Union budget of India](/wiki/Union_budget_of_India \"Union budget of India\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rail_Budget&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** <http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/railway-budget-to-be-merged-with-general-budget-from-2017/article8988441.ece>\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"No. 32188\"](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/32188/supplement/278). _[The London Gazette](/wiki/The_London_Gazette \"The London Gazette\")_ (Supplement). 11 January 1921. p. 278.\n  3. **Jump up ^** Powell Anstey, Vera (1952).
