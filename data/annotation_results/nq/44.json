Set in [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), the film is loosely based on\nevents in New York and Chicago from the early 1920s to 1931 during\n[Prohibition](/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States \"Prohibition in the\nUnited States\"), specifically the exploits of real-life\n[gangsters](/wiki/Gangster \"Gangster\") like [Al Capone](/wiki/Al_Capone \"Al\nCapone\") and [Bugs Moran](/wiki/Bugs_Moran \"Bugs Moran\"), as dramatized in\ncinema. Parker lightened the subject matter considerably for the children's\nmarket; in the U.S. the film received a [G rating](/wiki/MPAA_rating \"MPAA\nrating\").\n\nThe film was Parker's feature-length [directorial\ndebut](/wiki/Directorial_debut \"Directorial debut\"), introduced actor [Scott\nBaio](/wiki/Scott_Baio \"Scott Baio\"), and featured a 13-year old [Jodie\nFoster](/wiki/Jodie_Foster \"Jodie Foster\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Casting\n    * 3.2 Music\n    * 3.3 Filming\n  * 4 Release\n  * 5 Accolades\n  * 6 Home media\n  * 7 Soundtrack\n  * 8 Legacy\n  * 9 Stage adaptation\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 External links\n\n## Plot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bugsy_Malone&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Plot\")]\n\nA mobster named Roxy Robinson is \"splurged\" by members of a gang, using rapid-\nfire cream-shooting \"splurge guns\". Once splurged, a kid is \"all washed up...\nfinished\". [Speakeasy](/wiki/Speakeasy \"Speakeasy\") boss Fat Sam introduces\nhimself and Bugsy Malone, a boxing promoter with no money (\"Bugsy Malone\").\n\nAt Fat Sam's [speakeasy](/wiki/Speakeasy \"Speakeasy\"), there is much dancing\nand singing (\"Fat Sam's Grand Slam\"). Fat Sam is worried that his rival Dandy\nDan will try to take control of the speakeasy. Blousey Brown, an aspiring\nsinger, has come for an audition, but Sam is too distracted to see her. Bugsy\nmeets Blousey when he trips over her luggage. He is smitten and flirts with\nher. Fat Sam's is raided by Dandy Dan's men, who shoot up the place. Dandy\nDan's men continue to attack Fat Sam's empire, eventually taking away rackets\nand splurging members of Fat Sam's gang. Fat Sam sends all his available men\nto see if they can track down the guns. They are trapped at a laundry and all\nare splurged by Dandy Dan's gang.\n\nBugsy returns to Fat Sam's to arrange a new audition for Blousey. Fat Sam's\ngirlfriend, the chanteuse Tallulah, makes a pass at him. Although Bugsy\nrejects her flirtation, Tallulah plants a big kiss on Bugsy's forehead when\nBlousey enters; Blousey is jealous. Fat Sam hires Blousey after her audition,\nbut she refuses to speak to Bugsy (\"I'm Feelin' Fine\").\n\nFat Sam hires Bugsy to accompany him to a meeting with Dandy Dan. The meeting\nis a trap, but Bugsy helps Fat Sam escape. Gratefully, Fat Sam pays him $200.\nBugsy and Blousey reconcile and have a romantic outing on a lake; Bugsy\npromises to take her to Hollywood. When he returns Sam's car to the garage, he\nis attacked and his money is stolen. Bugsy is saved by Leroy Smith, who\nassaults the attackers and drives them away. Bugsy realizes that Leroy has the\npotential to be a great boxer. Bugsy introduces Leroy to Cagey Joe and helps\nhim train (\"So You Wanna Be a Boxer?\"). Fat Sam again seeks Bugsy's aid after\nhis assistant Knuckles is unintentionally killed. Bugsy resists, but Fat Sam\noffers $400, enough money to keep his promise to Blousey. Blousey is\ndisappointed when she learns that Bugsy hasn't bought the tickets to\nCalifornia yet (\"Ordinary Fool\"). Bugsy and Leroy follow Dandy Dan's men to a\nwarehouse, where the guns are being stashed. The two of them can't take the\nplace alone, so Bugsy recruits a large group of down-and-out workers at a soup\nkitchen (\"Down and Out\").\n\nThey steal the crates of guns and take them to Fat Sam's, arriving just as\nDandy Dan's gang arrives. Chaos ensues as a massive splurge gun fight erupts,\ncovering everyone (except Bugsy and Blousey) with cream. Unarmed patrons throw\ncream pies. The piano player is hit from behind and falls onto the keys,\nstriking a single bass note. The tone silences the room, and the cream-covered\ncrowd performs in a final number (\"You Give a Little Love\"). They realize they\ncan all be friends, and Bugsy and Blousey leave for Hollywood.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bugsy_Malone&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Scott Baio](/wiki/Scott_Baio \"Scott Baio\") as Bugsy Malone, an Italian-Irish ex-boxer/boxing scout.\n  * [Florrie Dugger](/wiki/Florrie_Dugger \"Florrie Dugger\") as Blousey Brown, a sassy young dame interested in Hollywood.\n  * [Jodie Foster](/wiki/Jodie_Foster \"Jodie Foster\") as Tallulah, Fat Sam's [gun moll](/wiki/Gun_moll \"Gun moll\"), the speakeasy's star [chanteuse](/wiki/Chanteuse \"Chanteuse\") and Bugsy's old flame.\n  * [John Cassisi](/wiki/John_Cassisi \"John Cassisi\") as Fat Sam Staccetto, crime boss.

Parker was trying to find a film project that was not\n\"parochial\" and decided upon an American gangster setting: \"I had four young\nchildren and we used to go to a cottage in Derbyshire at weekends. On the\nlong, boring car journey up there, I started telling them the story of a\ngangster called Bugsy Malone. They’d ask me questions and I’d make up answers,\nbased on my memories of watching old movie reruns as a kid.\" His eldest son\nsuggested children should be cast as the \"heroes\".[6]\n\n### Casting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bugsy_Malone&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Casting\")]\n\nThe director chose to cast several unknown actors in the film. To find his Fat\nSam, Parker visited a [Brooklyn](/wiki/Brooklyn \"Brooklyn\") classroom, asking\nfor \"the naughtiest boy in class\". The students were unanimous in selecting\n[John Cassisi](/wiki/John_Cassisi \"John Cassisi\"), and Parker gave him the\nrole. Florrie Dugger (Blousey) was originally cast in a smaller role; when the\nactress cast as Blousey suddenly grew taller than Baio, Dugger was promoted.\nShe had been \"discovered\" at [RAF Chicksands](/wiki/RAF_Chicksands \"RAF\nChicksands\"), an air force base in Bedfordshire where her American father was\nstationed.[7] At the time of filming, all of the cast were under 17 years\nold.[8]\n\nParker cast Baio after he slammed down the script and stormed out of his\naudition.[6] Baio later remembered:\n\n> I had quit the business, because I didn’t like driving into Manhattan. Well,\n> the long and the short of it is that I wanted to play with my friends after\n> school, but it happened to be raining that day, so I went to the city to\n> meet with Alan Parker. I read it, but I just barely read it. I didn’t even\n> want to be there. He was English, but I didn’t even know what that was. He\n> was just this weird guy with long hair, and I didn’t know what he was.\n> [Laughs.] So I sort of read the script, threw it at him, and walked out the\n> door. That was it: I’d gotten the part before I got home.[9]\n\n### Music[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bugsy_Malone&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Music\")]\n\nParker chose [Paul Williams](/wiki/Paul_Williams_\\(songwriter\\) \"Paul Williams\n\\(songwriter\\)\") to score the film in order to get a more \"palatable\" modern\nsound, and simply because he liked him.[10] Williams had scored [Brian De\nPalma](/wiki/Brian_De_Palma \"Brian De Palma\")'s commercial failure _[Phantom\nof the Paradise](/wiki/Phantom_of_the_Paradise \"Phantom of the Paradise\")_ ,\nbut had also written huge pop-radio hits (such as \"[We've Only Just\nBegun](/wiki/We%27ve_Only_Just_Begun \"We've Only Just Begun\")\" (lyrics), and\n\"[(Just An) Old Fashioned Love Song](/wiki/An_Old_Fashioned_Love_Song \"An Old\nFashioned Love Song\")\"). In fact, Williams would soon win an\n[Oscar](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\") for his song\n\"[Evergreen](/wiki/Evergreen_\\(Love_Theme_from_A_Star_Is_Born\\) \"Evergreen\n\\(Love Theme from A Star Is Born\\)\")\" from the film _[A Star Is\nBorn](/wiki/A_Star_Is_Born_\\(1976_film\\) \"A Star Is Born \\(1976 film\\)\")_\n(1976).\n\nWilliams felt that \"...the challenge for me was to provide songs that\nreflected the period ... and yet maintained an energy that would hold the\nyoung audiences attention.\" According to Parker, Williams was writing while on\ntour, recording songs in different cities, and sending the completed tapes to\nHollywood. Arriving during the first pre-shoot rehearsals, the songs had to be\naccepted and used as they were, with voices by Williams, Archie Hahn and\nothers.\n\nNeither the director nor the songwriter was entirely comfortable with the\nresults. Williams later wrote \"I'm really proud of the work and the only thing\nI've ever doubted is the choice of using adult voices. Perhaps I should have\ngiven the kids a chance to sing the songs.\" Parker also commented: \"Watching\nthe film after all these years, this is one aspect that I find the most\nbizarre. Adult voices coming out of these kids' mouths? I had told Paul that I\ndidn't want squeaky kids voices and he interpreted this in his own way.\nAnyway, as the tapes arrived, scarcely weeks away from filming, we had no\nchoice but to go along with it!\"[11]\n\n### Filming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bugsy_Malone&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Filming\")]\n\nThe film was rehearsed and shot in England, largely on [Pinewood\nStudios](/wiki/Pinewood_Studios \"Pinewood Studios\")' \"H\" stage, with locations\nin [Black Park Country Park](/wiki/Black_Park \"Black Park\") (Wexham,\nBuckinghamshire) and Reading, Berkshire.\n\nThe \"splurge firearm\" proved to be problematic. After initial experiments with\ncream-filled wax balls proved painful, Parker decided to abandon the idea of\nfilming the firearms directly. Instead, the firearms fired ping-pong balls,\nand a [fast cut](/wiki/Fast_cutting \"Fast cutting\") to a victim being pelted\nwith \"splurge\" was used to convey the impression of the rapid-firing\nfirearms.[8]\n\nBaio later said making the film was \"awesome\":\n\n> A kid’s fantasy: You get to dress up as gangster, you get to shoot guns that\n> fire whipped cream, you get to drive cars with pedals that look like real\n> cars, and you get to talk like a grown-up. I mean, you couldn’t ask for a\n> better first big gig. Talk about getting you hooked on a business! It was\n> fantastic.[9]\n\n## Release[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bugsy_Malone&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Release\")]\n\n_Bugsy Malone_ was released in late 1976 to generally positive reviews. On\n[Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten Tomatoes\"), it currently holds\na score of 83% based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.[12]\nDespite the positive critical reception, _Bugsy Malone_ was not a commercial\nsuccess in the US, bringing in just over $2.7 million. Paramount gave it a\n[limited release](/wiki/Limited_release \"Limited release\"), usually in second-\ntier theaters in a double-bill with _[The Bad News\nBears](/wiki/The_Bad_News_Bears \"The Bad News Bears\")_ , which had already\nbeen out for six months and was no longer much of a draw. According to Parker,\nthe film was \"quite successful\" in the United Kingdom. By 1985, it had earned\nan estimated profit of £1,854,000.[3]\n\n## Accolades[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bugsy_Malone&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Accolades\")]\n\nThe film garnered 15 award nominations, including \"Best Motion Picture\n(Musical/Comedy)\", \"Best Original Score\" and \"Best Original Song\" (for the\ntitle track) from the [Golden Globes](/wiki/Golden_Globe \"Golden Globe\"), and\nan [Oscar](/wiki/Academy_Awards \"Academy Awards\") for \"[Best Original Song\nScore](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score \"Academy Award for Best\nOriginal Score\")\" (Paul Williams).
