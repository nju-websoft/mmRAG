Human diploid cell rabies vaccines are [inactivated\nvaccines](/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine \"Inactivated vaccine\") made using the\nattenuated Pitman-Moore L503 strain of the virus.[7] Human diploid cell rabies\nvaccines have been given to more than 1.5 million people as of\n2006.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nIn addition to these developments, newer and less expensive purified chicken\nembryo cell vaccine, and purified [Vero cell](/wiki/Vero_cell \"Vero cell\")\nrabies vaccine are now available. The purified Vero cell rabies vaccine uses\nthe attenuated Wistar strain of the rabies virus, and uses the Vero cell line\nas its host.\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rabies_vaccine&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nVirtually all infections with rabies resulted in death until two French\nscientists, [Louis Pasteur](/wiki/Louis_Pasteur \"Louis Pasteur\") and [Émile\nRoux](/wiki/%C3%89mile_Roux \"Émile Roux\"), developed the first rabies\nvaccination in 1885. This vaccine was first used on a human on July 6, 1885,\non nine-year-old [Joseph Meister](/wiki/Joseph_Meister \"Joseph Meister\")\n(1876–1940), who had been mauled by a rabid dog.[8]\n\nTheir vaccine consisted of a sample of the virus harvested from infected (and\nnecessarily dead) rabbits that was weakened by allowing it to dry for 5 to 10\ndays. Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used now in some\ncountries, and while they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines,\nthey are not as effective.[9] Neural tissue vaccines also carry a certain risk\nof neurological complications.[10]\n\n## Veterinary\nuse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rabies_vaccine&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Veterinary use\")]\n\n![Unbalanced scales.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png) | **A major contributor to this article appears to have a[close connection](/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest \"Wikipedia:Conflict of interest\") with its subject.** It may require [cleanup](/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup \"Wikipedia:Cleanup\") to comply with Wikipedia's content policies, particularly [neutral point of view](/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view \"Wikipedia:Neutral point of view\").

In many jurisdictions, domestic dogs,\ncats, ferrets, and rabbits are required to be vaccinated.\n\n### Dogs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rabies_vaccine&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Dogs\")]\n\nAside from vaccinating humans, another approach was also developed by\nvaccinating dogs to prevent the spread of the virus. In 1979 the Van Houweling\nResearch Laboratory of the [Silliman University](/wiki/Silliman_University\n\"Silliman University\") Medical Center in [Dumaguete](/wiki/Dumaguete\n\"Dumaguete\") in the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\"),[11]\ndeveloped and produced a [dog vaccine](/wiki/Dog_vaccine \"Dog vaccine\") that\ngave a three-year immunity from [rabies](/wiki/Rabies \"Rabies\"). The\ndevelopment of the vaccine resulted in the elimination of rabies in many parts\nof the [Visayas](/wiki/Visayas \"Visayas\") and [Mindanao](/wiki/Mindanao\n\"Mindanao\") Islands. The successful program in the Philippines was later used\nas a model by other countries, such as [Ecuador](/wiki/Ecuador \"Ecuador\") and\nthe [Yucatan State](/wiki/Yucatan \"Yucatan\") of [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico\n\"Mexico\"), in their fight against rabies conducted in collaboration with the\n[World Health Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization \"World Health\nOrganization\").[12]\n\nIn [Tunisia](/wiki/Tunisia \"Tunisia\") a rabies control program was initiated\nto give dog owners free vaccination to promote mass vaccination which was\nsponsored by their government. The vaccine is known as Rabisin\n([Mérial](/wiki/Merial \"Merial\")), which is a [cell](/wiki/Cell_\\(biology\\)\n\"Cell \\(biology\\)\") based rabies vaccine only used countrywide. Vaccinations\nare often administered when owners take in their dogs for check-ups and visits\nat the vet.[13]\n\n### Wild\nanimals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rabies_vaccine&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Wild animals\")]\n\nThere is also vaccination in pellet form which can be left out for wild\nanimals to produce a [herd immunity](/wiki/Herd_immunity \"Herd immunity\")\neffect.[14] Oral rabies vaccination (ORV) is a preventive measure to eradicate\n[rabies](/wiki/Rabies \"Rabies\") in wild animal vectors of disease, mainly\n[foxes](/wiki/Fox \"Fox\"), [raccoons](/wiki/Raccoon \"Raccoon\"), [raccoon\ndogs](/wiki/Raccoon_dog \"Raccoon dog\"), [coyotes](/wiki/Coyote \"Coyote\") and\n[jackals](/wiki/Jackal \"Jackal\"), but also can be used for [dogs](/wiki/Dog\n\"Dog\") in [developing countries](/wiki/Developing_countries \"Developing\ncountries\").[15] Baits are distributed by [airplanes](/wiki/Airplanes\n\"Airplanes\") in rural areas and by hand in urban and suburban areas. The idea\nof [wildlife](/wiki/Wildlife \"Wildlife\") vaccination was conceived during the\n1960s, and modified-live rabies viruses were used for the experimental oral\nvaccination of [carnivores](/wiki/Carnivores \"Carnivores\") by the 1970s. The\ndevelopment of safe and effective rabies virus vaccines applied in attractive\n[baits](/wiki/Bait_\\(luring_substance\\) \"Bait \\(luring substance\\)\") resulted\nin the first field trials in [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland \"Switzerland\") in\n1978 to immunize red foxes.[16] ORV programs have seen success in preventing\nthe westward spread of raccoon variant rabies in the United States and even\neradicating rabies in red foxes in Switzerland.[17][18]\n\nImrab is an example of a veterinary rabies vaccine containing the Pasteur\nstrain of killed rabies virus. Several different types of Imrab exist,\nincluding Imrab, Imrab 3, and Imrab Large Animal. Imrab 3 has been approved\nfor [ferrets](/wiki/Ferret \"Ferret\") and, in some areas, [pet\nskunks](/wiki/Skunks_as_pets \"Skunks as pets\").[19][20]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rabies_vaccine&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ _**h**_ _**i**_ _**j**_ _**k**_ _**l**_ _**m**_ _**n**_ _**o**_ _**p**_ _**q**_ _**r**_ _**s**_ _**t**_ _**u**_ [\"Rabies vaccines: WHO position paper\"](http://www.who.int/wer/2010/wer8532.pdf?ua=1) (PDF). _Weekly epidemiological record_. **32** (85): 309–320.
