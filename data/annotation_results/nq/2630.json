normally known as **the Commonwealth** ,[2]\nis an [intergovernmental organisation](/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization\n\"Intergovernmental organization\") of [53 member\nstates](/wiki/Member_states_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations \"Member states of\nthe Commonwealth of Nations\") that are mostly former\n[territories](/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_British_Empire \"Territorial\nevolution of the British Empire\") of the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire\n\"British Empire\").[3] The chief institutions of the organisation are the\n[Commonwealth Secretariat](/wiki/Commonwealth_Secretariat \"Commonwealth\nSecretariat\"), which focuses on intergovernmental aspects, and the\n[Commonwealth Foundation](/wiki/Commonwealth_Foundation \"Commonwealth\nFoundation\"), which focuses on non-governmental relations between member\nstates.[4]\n\nThe Commonwealth dates back to the first half of the 20th century with the\n[decolonisation](/wiki/Decolonization \"Decolonization\") of the British Empire\nthrough increased [self-governance](/wiki/Self-governance \"Self-governance\")\nof its territories. It was originally created as the _British Commonwealth of\nNations_[5] through the [Balfour\nDeclaration](/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1926 \"Balfour Declaration of 1926\")\nat the [1926 Imperial Conference](/wiki/1926_Imperial_Conference \"1926\nImperial Conference\"), and formalised by the United Kingdom through the\n[Statute of Westminster](/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931 \"Statute of\nWestminster 1931\") in 1931. The current Commonwealth of Nations was formally\nconstituted by the [London Declaration](/wiki/London_Declaration \"London\nDeclaration\") in 1949, which modernised the community, and established the\nmember states as \"free and equal\".[6] The symbol of this free association is\n[Queen Elizabeth II](/wiki/Elizabeth_II \"Elizabeth II\"), who is the [Head of\nthe Commonwealth](/wiki/Head_of_the_Commonwealth \"Head of the Commonwealth\").\nThe Queen is [head of state](/wiki/Head_of_state \"Head of state\") of 16 member\nstates, known as the [Commonwealth realms](/wiki/Commonwealth_realms\n\"Commonwealth realms\"), while 32 other members are\n[republics](/wiki/Republics_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations \"Republics in the\nCommonwealth of Nations\") and five others have different monarchs.\n\nMember states have no legal obligations to one another. Instead, they are\nunited by [language](/wiki/English_language \"English language\"), history,\nculture and their shared values of [democracy](/wiki/Democracy \"Democracy\"),\n[human rights](/wiki/Human_rights \"Human rights\") and the [rule of\nlaw](/wiki/Rule_of_law \"Rule of law\").[4] These values are enshrined in the\n[Commonwealth Charter](/wiki/Charter_of_the_Commonwealth \"Charter of the\nCommonwealth\")[7] and promoted by the quadrennial [Commonwealth\nGames](/wiki/Commonwealth_Games \"Commonwealth Games\").\n\nThe countries of the Commonwealth covers more than 29,958,050 km2 (11,566,870\nsq mi), equivalent to 20% of the world's land area and spans all six inhabited\n[continents](/wiki/Continent \"Continent\").\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Origins of the concept and establishment of the term\n    * 1.2 Adoption and formalisation of the Commonwealth\n    * 1.3 Decolonisation and self-governance\n    * 1.4 Declining roles\n    * 1.5 Republics\n    * 1.6 New Commonwealth\n    * 1.7 Plan G and inviting Europe to join\n  * 2 Structure\n    * 2.1 Head of the Commonwealth\n    * 2.2 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting\n    * 2.3 Commonwealth Secretariat\n    * 2.4 Commonwealth citizenship and high commissioners\n  * 3 Membership\n    * 3.1 Criteria\n    * 3.2 Members\n    * 3.3 Applicants\n    * 3.4 Suspension\n    * 3.5 Termination\n  * 4 Politics\n    * 4.1 Objectives and activities\n    * 4.2 Competence\n    * 4.3 Proposed free movement policy\n  * 5 Economy\n    * 5.1 Economic data by member\n    * 5.2 Postwar\n      * 5.2.1 UK joins the European Economic Community\n    * 5.3 Trade\n  * 6 Commonwealth Family\n    * 6.1 Commonwealth Foundation\n    * 6.2 Commonwealth Games\n    * 6.3 Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n    * 6.4 Commonwealth of Learning\n    * 6.5 The Commonwealth Local Government Forum\n  * 7 Culture\n    * 7.1 Sport\n    * 7.2 Literature\n      * 7.2.1 English as official language\n    * 7.3 Political system\n    * 7.4 Symbols\n    * 7.5 Recognition\n    * 7.6 Commonwealth Anthem\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Further reading\n    * 10.1 Primary sources\n  * 11 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Origins of the concept and establishment of the\nterm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Origins of the concept and establishment of the term\")]\n\nMain articles: [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") and\n[Historiography of the British\nEmpire](/wiki/Historiography_of_the_British_Empire \"Historiography of the\nBritish Empire\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg/220px-\nCommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg)](/wiki/File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe prime ministers of five members at the 1944 [Commonwealth Prime Ministers'\nConference](/wiki/Commonwealth_Prime_Ministers%27_Conference \"Commonwealth\nPrime Ministers' Conference\").

She declared: \"So, it also marks the beginning of that free\nassociation of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of\nNations.\"[8] As long ago as 1884 [Lord\nRosebery](/wiki/Archibald_Primrose,_5th_Earl_of_Rosebery \"Archibald Primrose,\n5th Earl of Rosebery\") had described, while visiting Australia, the changing\nBritish Empire, as some of its colonies became more independent, as a\n\"Commonwealth of Nations\".[9] Conferences of British and colonial prime\nministers occurred periodically from [the first one in\n1887](/wiki/First_Colonial_Conference \"First Colonial Conference\"), leading to\nthe creation of the [Imperial Conferences](/wiki/Imperial_Conference \"Imperial\nConference\") in 1911.[10]\n\nThe Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences. A specific proposal\nwas presented by [Jan Smuts](/wiki/Jan_Smuts \"Jan Smuts\") in 1917 when he\ncoined the term \"the British Commonwealth of Nations\" and envisioned the\n\"future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence\" at the [Paris\nPeace Conference of 1919](/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919 \"Paris Peace\nConference, 1919\") by delegates from the Dominions as well as Britain.[11][12]\nThe term first received imperial statutory recognition in the [Anglo-Irish\nTreaty](/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty \"Anglo-Irish Treaty\") of 1921, when the term\n_British Commonwealth of Nations_ was substituted for _British Empire_ in the\nwording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish Free\nState.[13]\n\n### Adoption and formalisation of the\nCommonwealth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Adoption and formalisation of the Commonwealth\")]\n\nIn the [Balfour Declaration](/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1926 \"Balfour\nDeclaration of 1926\") at the [1926 Imperial\nConference](/wiki/1926_Imperial_Conference \"1926 Imperial Conference\"),\nBritain and its dominions agreed they were \"equal in status, in no way\nsubordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external\naffairs, though united by common allegiance to the Crown, and freely\nassociated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.\" The term\n\"[Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth \"Commonwealth\")\" was officially adopted to\ndescribe the community.[14]\n\nThese aspects to the relationship were formalised by the [Statute of\nWestminster](/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931 \"Statute of Westminster 1931\")\nin 1931, which applied to [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") without the need for\nratification, but [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"), [New\nZealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\"), and\n[Newfoundland](/wiki/Dominion_of_Newfoundland \"Dominion of Newfoundland\") had\nto ratify the statute for it to take effect. Newfoundland never did, as on 16\nFebruary 1934, with the consent of its parliament, the government of\nNewfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from\nLondon. Newfoundland later joined Canada as its [10th\nprovince](/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada \"Provinces and territories\nof Canada\") in 1949.[15] Australia and New Zealand ratified the Statute in\n[1942](/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_Adoption_Act_1942 \"Statute of Westminster\nAdoption Act 1942\") and [1947](/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_Adoption_Act_1947\n\"Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947\") respectively.[16][17]\n\nAlthough the Union of South Africa was not among the Dominions that needed to\nadopt the Statute of Westminster for it to take effect, two laws—the Status of\nthe Union Act, 1934, and the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act of\n1934—were passed to confirm South Africa's status as a sovereign state.[18]\n\n### Decolonisation and self-\ngovernance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Decolonisation and self-governance\")]\n\nMain article: [List of countries that have gained independence from the United\nKingdom](/wiki/List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom\n\"List of countries that have gained independence from the United Kingdom\")\n\nAfter [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") ended, the British\nEmpire was gradually dismantled.

More broadly,\nthere was the loss of a central role of the British Empire: the defence of the\nEmpire. That role was no longer militarily or financially feasible, as\n[Britain's withdrawal from Greece in 1947](/wiki/Truman_Doctrine \"Truman\nDoctrine\") had painfully demonstrated. Britain itself was now just one part of\nthe [NATO](/wiki/NATO \"NATO\") military alliance in which the Commonwealth had\nno role apart from Canada. The ANZUS treaty of 1955 linked Australia, New\nZealand, and the United States in a defensive alliance, with Britain and the\nCommonwealth left out. The second major function of the Empire made London the\nfinancial centre of the system. After the Second World War, the British\ntreasury was so weak that it could not operate independently of the United\nStates. The loss of defence and financial roles, furthermore, undermined\nJoseph Chamberlain's early 20th century vision of a world empire that could\ncombine Imperial preference, mutual defence, and social growth arm.\nFurthermore, Britain's cosmopolitan role in world affairs became increasingly\nlimited, especially with the losses of India and Singapore.[23] While British\nelites at first hoped the Commonwealth would preserve and project British\ninfluence, they gradually lost their enthusiasm, argues Krishnan Srinivasan.\nEarly enthusiasm waned as British policies came under fire in Commonwealth\nmeetings. Public opinion became troubled as immigration from non-white member\nstates became large-scale.[24]\n\n###\nRepublics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Republics\")]\n\nOn 18 April 1949, Ireland formally became a republic in accordance with the\nIrish [Republic of Ireland Act 1948](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948\n\"Republic of Ireland Act 1948\"). Because it did this, it was automatically\nexcluded from the Commonwealth. While Ireland had not actively participated in\nthe Commonwealth since the early 1930s and was content to leave the\nCommonwealth, other dominions wished to become republics without losing\nCommonwealth ties. The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a Commonwealth\nprime ministers' meeting in London. Under the [London\nDeclaration](/wiki/London_Declaration \"London Declaration\"),\n[India](/wiki/India \"India\") agreed that, when it became a republic in January\n1950, it would accept the British Sovereign as a \"symbol of the free\nassociation of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the\nCommonwealth\". Upon hearing this, King [George VI](/wiki/George_VI \"George\nVI\") told the Indian politician [Krishna Menon](/wiki/Krishna_Menon \"Krishna\nMenon\"): \"So, I've become 'as such'\".[25] The other Commonwealth countries\nrecognised India's continuing membership of the association. At Pakistan's\ninsistence, India was not regarded as an exceptional case and it was assumed\nthat other states would be accorded the same treatment as India.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe London Declaration is often seen as marking the beginning of the modern\nCommonwealth. Following India's precedent, other nations became\n[republics](/wiki/Republic \"Republic\"), or [constitutional\nmonarchies](/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy \"Constitutional monarchy\") with\ntheir own monarchs, while some countries retained the same monarch as the\nUnited Kingdom, but their monarchies developed differently and soon became\nfully independent of the British monarchy. The monarch is regarded as a\nseparate [legal personality](/wiki/Legal_personality \"Legal personality\") in\neach realm, even though the same person is monarch of each realm.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### New\nCommonwealth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: New Commonwealth\")]\n\nPlanners in the interwar period, like [Lord\nDavies](/wiki/David_Davies,_1st_Baron_Davies \"David Davies, 1st Baron\nDavies\"), who had also taken \"a prominent part in building up the League of\nNations Union\" in the United Kingdom, in 1932 founded the [New Commonwealth\nSociety](/wiki/New_Commonwealth_Society \"New Commonwealth Society\"), of which\nBritish section [Winston Churchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill \"Winston\nChurchill\") became the president.[26] This new society was aimed at the\ncreation of an international air force to be the arm of the [League of\nNations](/wiki/League_of_Nations \"League of Nations\"), to allow nations to\ndisarm and safeguard the peace.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe term **New Commonwealth** has been used in the UK (especially in the 1960s\nand 1970s) to refer to recently [decolonised](/wiki/Decolonization\n\"Decolonization\") countries, predominantly non-[white](/wiki/White_race \"White\nrace\") and [developing](/wiki/Developing_country \"Developing country\"). It was\noften used in debates about [immigration](/wiki/Immigration \"Immigration\")\nfrom these countries.[27] Britain and the pre-1945 dominions became informally\nknown as the **Old Commonwealth** , or more pointedly as the **white\nCommonwealth**.[28]\n\n### Plan G and inviting Europe to\njoin[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Plan G and inviting Europe to join\")]\n\nAt a time when Germany and France, together with Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg,\nand the Netherlands, were planning for what later became the [European\nUnion](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\"), and newly independent African\ncountries were joining the Commonwealth, new ideas were floated to prevent\nBritain from becoming isolated in economic affairs. British trade with the\nCommonwealth was four times larger than trade with Europe. The British\ngovernment under Prime Minister [Anthony Eden](/wiki/Anthony_Eden \"Anthony\nEden\") considered in 1956 and 1957 a \"plan G\" to create a European free trade\nzone while also protecting the favoured status of the\nCommonwealth.[29][30][31] Britain also considered inviting Scandinavian and\nother European countries to join the Commonwealth so it would become a major\neconomic common market.

Nevertheless, the closer association amongst\nCommonwealth countries is reflected at least in the diplomatic protocols of\nthe Commonwealth countries. For example, when engaging bilaterally with one\nanother, Commonwealth governments exchange [high\ncommissioners](/wiki/High_commissioner_\\(Commonwealth\\) \"High commissioner\n\\(Commonwealth\\)\") instead of [ambassadors](/wiki/Ambassador \"Ambassador\").\nBetween two Commonwealth realms, they represent the [head of\ngovernment](/wiki/Head_of_government \"Head of government\") rather than the\n[head of state](/wiki/Head_of_state \"Head of state\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn addition, some members treat resident citizens of other Commonwealth\ncountries preferentially to citizens of non-Commonwealth countries.

The [Statute of Westminster\n1931](/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931 \"Statute of Westminster 1931\"), as a\nfundamental founding document of the organisation, laid out that membership\nrequired dominionhood. The 1949 [London Declaration](/wiki/London_Declaration\n\"London Declaration\") ended this, allowing republican and indigenous monarchic\nmembers on the condition that they recognised the British monarch as the\n\"[Head of the Commonwealth](/wiki/Head_of_the_Commonwealth \"Head of the\nCommonwealth\")\".[43] In the wake of the wave of\n[decolonisation](/wiki/Decolonisation \"Decolonisation\") in the 1960s, these\nconstitutional principles were augmented by political, economic, and social\nprinciples. The first of these was set out in 1961, when it was decided that\nrespect for [racial equality](/wiki/Racial_equality \"Racial equality\") would\nbe a requirement for membership, leading directly to the withdrawal of South\nAfrica's re-application (which they were required to make under the formula of\nthe London Declaration upon becoming a republic). The 14 points of the 1971\n[Singapore Declaration](/wiki/Singapore_Declaration \"Singapore Declaration\")\ndedicated all members to the principles of [world peace](/wiki/World_peace\n\"World peace\"), [liberty](/wiki/Liberty \"Liberty\"), [human\nrights](/wiki/Human_rights \"Human rights\"), [equality](/wiki/Egalitarianism\n\"Egalitarianism\"), and [free trade](/wiki/Free_trade \"Free trade\").[44]\n\nThese criteria were unenforceable for two decades,[45] until, in 1991, the\n[Harare Declaration](/wiki/Harare_Declaration \"Harare Declaration\") was\nissued, dedicating the leaders to applying the Singapore principles to the\ncompletion of decolonisation, the end of the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold\nWar\"), and the end of [apartheid](/wiki/Apartheid \"Apartheid\") in South\nAfrica.[46] The mechanisms by which these principles would be applied were\ncreated, and the manner clarified, by the 1995 [Millbrook Commonwealth Action\nProgramme](/wiki/Millbrook_Commonwealth_Action_Programme \"Millbrook\nCommonwealth Action Programme\"), which created the [Commonwealth Ministerial\nAction Group](/wiki/Commonwealth_Ministerial_Action_Group \"Commonwealth\nMinisterial Action Group\") (CMAG), which has the power to rule on whether\nmembers meet the requirements for membership under the Harare Declaration.[47]\nAlso in 1995, an Inter-Governmental Group was created to finalise and codify\nthe full requirements for membership. Upon reporting in 1997, as adopted under\nthe [Edinburgh Declaration](/wiki/Edinburgh_Declaration \"Edinburgh\nDeclaration\"), the Inter-Governmental Group ruled that any future members\nwould have to have a direct constitutional link with an existing member.[48]\n\nIn addition to this new rule, the former rules were consolidated into a single\ndocument. These requirements are that members must accept and comply with the\n[Harare principles](/wiki/Harare_Declaration \"Harare Declaration\"), be fully\n[sovereign](/wiki/Sovereignty \"Sovereignty\") states, recognise the monarch of\nthe [Commonwealth realms](/wiki/Commonwealth_realms \"Commonwealth realms\") as\nthe [Head of the Commonwealth](/wiki/Head_of_the_Commonwealth \"Head of the\nCommonwealth\"), accept the [English language](/wiki/English_language \"English\nlanguage\") as the means of Commonwealth communication, and respect the wishes\nof the general population with regard to Commonwealth membership.[48] These\nrequirements had undergone review, and a report on potential amendments was\npresented by the [Committee on Commonwealth\nMembership](/wiki/Committee_on_Commonwealth_Membership \"Committee on\nCommonwealth Membership\") at the [2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government\nMeeting](/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting_2007 \"Commonwealth\nHeads of Government Meeting 2007\").[49] New members were not admitted at this\nmeeting, though applications for admission were considered at the [2009\nCHOGM](/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting_2009 \"Commonwealth Heads\nof Government Meeting 2009\").[50]\n\nNew members must \"as a general rule\" have a direct constitutional link to an\nexisting member. In most cases, this is due to being a former colony of the\nUnited Kingdom, but some have links to other countries, either exclusively or\nmore directly (e.g. [Samoa](/wiki/Samoa \"Samoa\") to New Zealand, [Papua New\nGuinea](/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea \"Papua New Guinea\") to Australia, and\n[Namibia](/wiki/Namibia \"Namibia\") to South Africa). The first member to be\nadmitted without having any constitutional link to the British Empire or a\nCommonwealth member was [Mozambique](/wiki/Mozambique \"Mozambique\"), a former\n[Portuguese colony](/wiki/Portuguese_Empire \"Portuguese Empire\"), in 1995\nfollowing its first democratic elections and South Africa's re-admission in\n1994. Mozambique's controversial entry led to the [Edinburgh\nDeclaration](/wiki/Edinburgh_Declaration \"Edinburgh Declaration\") and the\ncurrent membership guidelines.[51] In 2009, [Rwanda](/wiki/Rwanda \"Rwanda\")\nbecame the second Commonwealth member admitted not to have any such\nconstitutional links.

Sharma stated that Fiji would remain a member of the\nCommonwealth during its suspension, but would be excluded from emblematic\nrepresentation by the secretariat.[82] On 19 March 2014 Fiji's full suspension\nwas amended to a suspension from councils of the Commonwealth by the\nCommonwealth Ministerial Action Group, permitting Fiji to join a number of\nCommonwealth activities, including the Commonwealth Games.[86] Fiji's\nsuspension was lifted in September 2014.[87] The Commonwealth Ministerial\nAction Group fully reinstated Fiji as a member following\n[elections](/wiki/Fijian_general_election,_2014 \"Fijian general election,\n2014\") in September 2014.[88]\n\nMost recently, during 2013 and 2014, international pressure mounted to suspend\n[Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka \"Sri Lanka\") from the Commonwealth, citing grave\nhuman rights violations by the government of President [Mahinda\nRajapaksa](/wiki/Mahinda_Rajapaksa \"Mahinda Rajapaksa\").

\n###\nPostwar[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Postwar\")]\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Commonwealth played a major role in helping\nBritish finances. Foreign exchange reserves were pooled in London, to be used\nto fight the war. In effect Britain borrowed £2.3 billion, of which £1.3\nbillion was from India. The debt was held in the form of British government\nsecurities and became known as \"sterling balances.\" By 1950, India, Pakistan\nand Ceylon had spent much of their sterling, while other countries accumulated\nmore. The sterling area that included all of the Commonwealth except for\nCanada, together with some smaller countries especially in the Persian Gulf.\nThey held their foreign-exchange in sterling, protecting that currency from\nruns, and facilitating trade and investment inside the Commonwealth. It was a\nformal relationship with fixed exchange rates, and periodic meetings at\nCommonwealth summits to coordinate trade policy, and domestic economic\npolicies. Britain ran a trade surplus, and the other countries were mostly\nproducers of raw materials sold to Britain. However the British economy was\nsluggish, compared to Western Europe, by the 1960s, and the commercial\nrationale was gradually less attractive to the Commonwealth. Access to the\ngrowing London capital market, however, remained an important advantage to the\nnewly independent nations. As Britain moved increasingly close to Europe,\nhowever, the long-term ties began to be in doubt.[117]\n\n#### UK joins the European Economic\nCommunity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: UK joins the European Economic Community\")]\n\nBritain had focused on the Commonwealth after the war, and largely ignored\nlinks with Europe. By the 1960s with a sluggish economy Britain tried\nrepeatedly to join the [European Economic\nCommunity](/wiki/European_Economic_Community \"European Economic Community\"),\nbut this was repeatedly vetoed by [Charles de Gaulle](/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle\n\"Charles de Gaulle\").[118] After his death, [entry was finally achieved in\n1972.](/wiki/European_Communities_Act_1972_\\(UK\\) \"European Communities Act\n1972 \\(UK\\)\") Queen Elizabeth was one of the few remaining links between the\nUK and the Commonwealth. She tried to reassure the other countries that the\nCommonwealth family was joining forces with the Europeans, and that the new\nlinks would not replace the old Commonwealth ties based on historical\nattachments, which were too sacred to break. Historian [Ben\nPimlott](/wiki/Ben_Pimlott \"Ben Pimlott\") argues that she was mistaken, for\njoining Europe, \"constituted the most decisive step yet in the progress of\nseverance of familial ties between Britain and its former Empire....It reduced\nthe remaining links to sentimental and cultural ones, and legal\nniceties.\"[119]\n\nThe newly independent countries of Africa and Asia concentrated on their own\ninternal political and economic development, and sometimes with their role in\nthe [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\"). The United States, international\nagencies, and the Soviet Union became important players, and the British role\nreceded. Indeed, the British considered them burdensome and were themselves\nalienated from traditional imperialism. The former colonies would rather have\na prosperous Britain linked to a prosperous Europe, rather than a declining\nloner.[120] The dominions saw that their historic ties with Britain were\nrapidly fraying. The Canadian economy was increasingly integrated with the\nUnited States, and had less and less to do with Britain or other Commonwealth\nnations. Internal Canadian disputes revolved around the growing American\ncultural economic presence, and the strong force of Québec nationalism and\neven independence. In 1964 the [Maple Leaf flag](/wiki/Flag_of_Canada \"Flag of\nCanada\") replaced the old Union Jack to the sorrow of many Anglophiles—it was\n\"the last gasp of empire.\"[121] Australia and New Zealand were in deep shock\nbut kept a low profile not wanting to alienate London.[122][123] Nevertheless,\nthe implications of British entry into Europe:\n\n    seemed shattering to most Australians, particularly to older people and conservatives. In fact the United Kingdom, as Australia's chief trading partner, was being very rapidly replaced just at this time by the United States and an economically resurgent Japan, but most people were scarcely aware of this.... It was feared that British entry into the Common Market was bound to mean abolition, or at least scaling down, of preferential tariff arrangements for Australians goods.[124]\n\n###\nTrade[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Trade\")]\n\nFurther information: [Commonwealth free trade](/wiki/Commonwealth_free_trade\n\"Commonwealth free trade\")\n\nAlthough the Commonwealth does not have a multilateral trade agreement,\nresearch by the [Royal Commonwealth Society](/wiki/Royal_Commonwealth_Society\n\"Royal Commonwealth Society\") has shown that [trade](/wiki/Trade \"Trade\") with\nanother Commonwealth member is up to 50% more than with a non-member on\naverage, with smaller and less wealthy states having a higher propensity to\ntrade within the Commonwealth.[125] At the 2005 Summit in Malta, the heads of\ngovernment endorsed pursuing free trade among Commonwealth members on a\nbilateral basis.[126]\n\nThere have been various proposals for a Commonwealth free trade zone,[127]\nhowever none have so far come to pass. Following its vote in June 2016 to\nleave the EU, some politicians in the United Kingdom have suggested the idea\nas an alternative to its [membership](/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union\n\"Member state of the European Union\") in the [European\nUnion](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\"),[128][129] however it is far\nfrom clear that this would either offer sufficient economic benefit to replace\nthe impact of leaving the EU or be acceptable to other member states[130]\nAlthough the EU is already in the process of negotiating free trade agreements\nwith many Commonwealth countries such as India and Canada, it took the EU\nalmost ten years to come to an agreement with Canada,[131][132] due to the\nchallenge associated with achieving the necessary EU-wide approvals.\n\n## Commonwealth\nFamily[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Commonwealth Family\")]\n\nMain article: [Commonwealth Family](/wiki/Commonwealth_Family \"Commonwealth\nFamily\")\n\nCommonwealth countries share many links outside government, with over a\nhundred Commonwealth-wide non-governmental organisations, notably for sport,\nculture, education, law and charity.

Started in 1930 as the Empire\nGames, the games were founded on the Olympic model of\n[amateurism](/wiki/Amateurism \"Amateurism\"), but were deliberately designed to\nbe \"the Friendly Games\",[134] with the goal of promoting relations between\nCommonwealth countries and celebrating their shared sporting and cultural\nheritage.[135]\n\nThe games are the Commonwealth's most visible activity[134] and interest in\nthe operation of the Commonwealth increases greatly when the Games are\nheld.[136] There is controversy over whether the games—and sport\ngenerally—should be involved in the Commonwealth's wider political\nconcerns.[135] The 1977 [Gleneagles Agreement](/wiki/Gleneagles_Agreement\n\"Gleneagles Agreement\") was signed to commit Commonwealth countries to combat\n[apartheid](/wiki/Apartheid \"Apartheid\") through discouraging sporting contact\nwith [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\") (which was not then a\nmember), whilst the [1986 games](/wiki/1986_Commonwealth_Games \"1986\nCommonwealth Games\") were boycotted by most African, Asian, and Caribbean\ncountries for the failure of other countries to enforce the Gleneagles\nAgreement.[137]\n\n### Commonwealth War Graves\nCommission[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Commonwealth War Graves Commission\")]\n\nMain article: [Commonwealth War Graves\nCommission](/wiki/Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission \"Commonwealth War Graves\nCommission\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Azmak_Cemetery%2C_Gallipoli_Peninsula.JPG/220px-\nAzmak_Cemetery%2C_Gallipoli_Peninsula.JPG)](/wiki/File:Azmak_Cemetery,_Gallipoli_Peninsula.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Azmak_Cemetery,_Gallipoli_Peninsula.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Commonwealth War Graves\nCommission](/wiki/Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission \"Commonwealth War Graves\nCommission\") serves to commemorate 1.7 million Commonwealth war dead and\nmaintains 2,500 war cemeteries around the world, including this one in\n[Gallipoli](/wiki/Gallipoli \"Gallipoli\").\n\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is responsible for maintaining\nthe [war graves](/wiki/War_grave \"War grave\") of 1.7 million service personnel\nthat died in the First and Second World Wars fighting for Commonwealth member\nstates. Founded in 1917 (as the Imperial War Graves Commission), the\nCommission has constructed 2,500 [war cemeteries](/wiki/War_cemetery \"War\ncemetery\"), and maintains individual graves at another 20,000 sites around the\nworld.[138] The vast majority of the latter are civilian cemeteries in Great\nBritain. In 1998, the CWGC made the records of its buried online to facilitate\neasier searching.[139]\n\nCommonwealth war cemeteries often feature similar\n[horticulture](/wiki/Horticulture \"Horticulture\") and architecture, with\nlarger cemeteries being home to a [Cross of\nSacrifice](/wiki/Cross_of_Sacrifice \"Cross of Sacrifice\") and [Stone of\nRemembrance](/wiki/Stone_of_Remembrance \"Stone of Remembrance\"). The CWGC is\nnotable for marking the graves identically, regardless of the rank, country of\norigin, race, or religion of the buried.[139] It is funded by voluntary\nagreement by six Commonwealth members, in proportion to the nationality of the\ncasualties in the graves maintained,[138] with 75% of the funding coming from\nBritain.[139]\n\n### Commonwealth of\nLearning[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Commonwealth of Learning\")]\n\nMain article: [Commonwealth of Learning](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Learning\n\"Commonwealth of Learning\")\n\nThe Commonwealth of Learning (COL) is an intergovernmental organisation\ncreated by the [Heads of Government](/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government\n\"Commonwealth Heads of Government\") to encourage the development and sharing\nof open learning/distance education knowledge, resources and technologies.

CLGF works with national and [local\ngovernments](/wiki/Local_government \"Local government\") to support the\ndevelopment of [democratic values](/wiki/Democracy \"Democracy\") and good local\ngovernance and is the associated organisation officially recognised by\n[Commonwealth Heads of Government](/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government\n\"Commonwealth Heads of Government\") as the representative body for local\ngovernment in the Commonwealth.[140]\n\nCLGF is unique in bringing together central, provincial and local spheres of\ngovernment involved in local government policy and decision-making. CLGF\nmembers include local government associations, individual local authorities,\nministries dealing with local government, and research and professional\norganisations who work with local government. Practitioner to practitioner\nsupport is at the core of CLGF's work across the Commonwealth and within the\nregion, using CLGF's own members to support others both within and between\nregions. CLGF is a member of the Global Taskforce of Local and Regional\nGovernments, the formal partner of the UN Major Group of Local\nAuthorities.[141]\n\n##\nCulture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Culture\")]\n\nMany Commonwealth nations possess traditions and customs that are elements of\na shared Commonwealth culture. Examples include common sports such as\n[cricket](/wiki/Cricket \"Cricket\") and [rugby](/wiki/Rugby_football \"Rugby\nfootball\"), [driving on the left](/wiki/Driving_on_the_left \"Driving on the\nleft\"), the [Westminster system](/wiki/Westminster_system \"Westminster\nsystem\") of [parliamentary democracy](/wiki/Parliamentary_democracy\n\"Parliamentary democracy\"), [common law](/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\"),\n[widespread use of the English language](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-\nspeaking_population \"List of countries by English-speaking population\"),\n[designation of English as an official\nlanguage](/wiki/List_of_countries_where_English_is_an_official_language \"List\nof countries where English is an official language\"), [military and naval\nranks](/wiki/Military_rank \"Military rank\"), and the use of British rather\nthan American spelling conventions (see [English in the Commonwealth of\nNations](/wiki/English_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations \"English in the\nCommonwealth of Nations\")).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n###\nSport[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=36\n\"Edit section: Sport\")]\n\nMany Commonwealth nations play similar [sports](/wiki/Sports \"Sports\") that\nare considered quintessentially British in character, rooted in and developed\nunder British rule or hegemony, including\n[football](/wiki/Association_football \"Association football\"),\n[cricket](/wiki/Cricket \"Cricket\"), [rugby](/wiki/Rugby_football \"Rugby\nfootball\"), and [netball](/wiki/Netball \"Netball\").[142] This has led to the\ndevelopment of friendly national rivalries between the main sporting nations\nthat have often defined their relations with each another. Indeed, said\nrivalries preserved close ties by providing a constant in international\nrelationships, even as the Empire transformed into the Commonwealth.[143]\nExternally, playing these sports is seen to be a sign of sharing a certain\nCommonwealth culture; the adoption of [cricket at schools in\nRwanda](/wiki/Rwanda_Cricket_Association \"Rwanda Cricket Association\") is seen\nas symbolic of the country's move towards Commonwealth membership.[144][145]\n\nBesides the [Commonwealth Games](/wiki/Commonwealth_Games \"Commonwealth\nGames\"), other sporting competitions are organised on a Commonwealth basis,\nthrough championship tournaments such as the [Commonwealth Taekwondo\nChampionships](/wiki/Commonwealth_Taekwondo_Championships \"Commonwealth\nTaekwondo Championships\"), [Commonwealth Fencing\nChampionships](/wiki/Commonwealth_Fencing_Championships \"Commonwealth Fencing\nChampionships\"), [Commonwealth Judo\nChampionships](/wiki/Commonwealth_Judo_Championships \"Commonwealth Judo\nChampionships\"), [Commonwealth Rowing\nChampionships](/wiki/Commonwealth_Rowing_Championships \"Commonwealth Rowing\nChampionships\"), [Commonwealth Sailing\nChampionships](/wiki/Commonwealth_Sailing_Championships \"Commonwealth Sailing\nChampionships\"), [Commonwealth Shooting\nChampionships](/wiki/Commonwealth_Shooting_Championships \"Commonwealth\nShooting Championships\") and [Commonwealth Pool Lifesaving\nChampionships](/wiki/Commonwealth_Pool_Lifesaving_Championships \"Commonwealth\nPool Lifesaving Championships\").

Prizes are awarded for the best book and best first book in the\nCommonwealth, as well as regional prizes for the best book and best first book\nfrom each of four regions. Although not officially affiliated with the\nCommonwealth, the prestigious annual [Man Booker Prize](/wiki/Booker_Prize\n\"Booker Prize\"), one of the highest honours in literature,[148] used to be\nawarded only to authors from Commonwealth countries or former members such as\n[Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\") and\n[Zimbabwe](/wiki/Zimbabwe \"Zimbabwe\"). Since 2014, however, writers of any\nnationality have been eligible for the prize providing that they write\noriginally in English and their novels are published by established publishers\nin the United Kingdom[149] From 1950 on a significant number of writers from\nthe countries of the Commonwealth of Nations began gaining international\nrecognition, including some who migrated to the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\").

South Africa's [Alan\nPaton](/wiki/Alan_Paton \"Alan Paton\")'s famous _[Cry, the Beloved\nCountry](/wiki/Cry,_the_Beloved_Country \"Cry, the Beloved Country\")_ dates\nfrom 1948. [Doris Lessing](/wiki/Doris_Lessing \"Doris Lessing\") from [Southern\nRhodesia](/wiki/Southern_Rhodesia \"Southern Rhodesia\"), now\n[Zimbabwe](/wiki/Zimbabwe \"Zimbabwe\"), was a dominant presence in the English\nliterary scene, frequently publishing from 1950 on throughout the 20th\ncentury.

The Commonwealth\nrequires its members to be functioning democracies that respect [human\nrights](/wiki/Human_rights \"Human rights\") and the [rule of\nlaw](/wiki/Rule_of_law \"Rule of law\"). Most Commonwealth countries have the\nbicameral [Westminster system](/wiki/Westminster_system \"Westminster system\")\nof [parliamentary](/wiki/Parliamentary_system \"Parliamentary system\")\ndemocracy.

The English language is recognised as a symbol of\nthe members' heritage; as well as being considered a symbol of the\nCommonwealth, recognition of it as \"the means of Commonwealth communication\"\nis a prerequisite for Commonwealth membership. The [flag of the\nCommonwealth](/wiki/Flag_of_the_Commonwealth \"Flag of the Commonwealth\")\nconsists of the symbol of the Commonwealth Secretariat, a gold globe\nsurrounded by emanating rays, on a dark blue field; it was designed for the\n[second CHOGM](/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting_1973\n\"Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1973\") in 1973, and officially\nadopted on 26 March 1976. 1976 also saw the organisation agree to a common\ndate on which to commemorate [Commonwealth Day](/wiki/Commonwealth_Day\n\"Commonwealth Day\"), the second Monday in March, having developed separately\non different dates from [Empire Day](/wiki/Empire_Day \"Empire Day\")\ncelebrations.[155]\n\n###\nRecognition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=41\n\"Edit section: Recognition\")]\n\nIn 2009, to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Commonwealth, the\n[Royal Commonwealth Society](/wiki/Royal_Commonwealth_Society \"Royal\nCommonwealth Society\") commissioned a poll of public opinion in seven of the\nmember states: Australia, Canada, India, Jamaica, Malaysia, South Africa and\nthe United Kingdom. It found that most people in these countries were largely\nignorant of the Commonwealth's activities, aside from the [Commonwealth\nGames](/wiki/Commonwealth_Games \"Commonwealth Games\"), and indifferent toward\nits future.
