The\nsong is a critical profile of a self-absorbed lover about whom Simon asserts\n\"You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you.\" The title\nsubject's identity has long been a matter of speculation, with Simon stating\nthat the song refers to three men, only one of whom she has named publicly,\nactor [Warren Beatty](/wiki/Warren_Beatty \"Warren Beatty\").[3] The song is\nranked at #92 on _[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ 's Greatest Songs of All-Time.[4] \"You're So Vain\" was voted\n#216 in [RIAA](/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America \"Recording\nIndustry Association of America\")'s [Songs of the\nCentury](/wiki/Songs_of_the_Century \"Songs of the Century\"), and in August\n2014, the UK's [Official Charts Company](/wiki/Official_Charts_Company\n\"Official Charts Company\") crowned it the ultimate song of the 1970s.[5]\n\nThe distinctive [bass guitar](/wiki/Bass_guitar \"Bass guitar\") intro is played\nby [Klaus Voormann](/wiki/Klaus_Voormann \"Klaus Voormann\").[6] The strings\nwere arranged by Simon and orchestrated by [Paul\nBuckmaster](/wiki/Paul_Buckmaster \"Paul Buckmaster\"). Simon plays piano on the\ntrack.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Subject of the song\n  * 2 References in the song\n  * 3 Later versions and adaptations\n  * 4 Chart performance\n    * 4.1 Weekly charts\n    * 4.2 Year-end charts\n    * 4.3 All-time charts\n  * 5 Awards\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Subject of the\nsong[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27re_So_Vain&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Subject of the song\")]\n\nBefore the song became a hit single in 1972, Simon told an interviewer that\nthe song was about \"men,\" not a specific \"man\".[7]\n\nIn 1983, she said it is not about [Mick Jagger](/wiki/Mick_Jagger \"Mick\nJagger\"),[8] who contributed uncredited [backing\nvocals](/wiki/Backing_vocalist \"Backing vocalist\") to the song.[9] In a 1993\nbook, [Angie Bowie](/wiki/Angie_Bowie \"Angie Bowie\") claimed to be the \"wife\nof a close friend\" mentioned in \"You're So Vain\", and that Jagger, for a time,\nhad been \"obsessed\" with her.[10] Simon made another comment about the\nsubject's identity as a guest artist on [Janet Jackson](/wiki/Janet_Jackson\n\"Janet Jackson\")'s 2001 single, \"[Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is\nAbout You)](/wiki/Son_of_a_Gun_\\(I_Betcha_Think_This_Song_Is_About_You\\) \"Son\nof a Gun \\(I Betcha Think This Song Is About You\\)\")\", which\n[sampled](/wiki/Sampling_\\(music\\) \"Sampling \\(music\\)\") \"You're So Vain\".\nSimon said about the song, \"The apricot scarf was worn by Nick\n([Delbanco](/wiki/Nicholas_Delbanco \"Nicholas Delbanco\")). Nothing in the\nwords referred to Mick.\"\n\nIn a 2007 interview, [Warren Beatty](/wiki/Warren_Beatty \"Warren Beatty\")\nsaid, \"Let's be honest. That song was about me.\"[11] Simon had said in 1983\nthat Beatty \"certainly thought it was about him — he called me and said thanks\nfor the song...\"[8] In an interview for the 1978/1982 version of _[The History\nof Rock and Roll](/wiki/The_History_of_Rock_and_Roll \"The History of Rock and\nRoll\")_ radio series, producer [Richard Perry](/wiki/Richard_Perry \"Richard\nPerry\") acknowledges that Simon was essentially referring to Beatty while also\nevoking other previous relationships in her life.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOver the years Simon has divulged \"letter clues\" and has claimed that the\nsubject's name contains the letters A, E, and R.[12]\n\nShortly before the writing of the song, Simon was married to [James\nTaylor](/wiki/James_Taylor \"James Taylor\"); she has said that he was\n\"definitely not\" the subject of the song.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] [David\nBowie](/wiki/David_Bowie \"David Bowie\"), [David Cassidy](/wiki/David_Cassidy\n\"David Cassidy\") and [Cat Stevens](/wiki/Cat_Stevens \"Cat Stevens\") have all\nbeen cited by the press as speculative candidates.[13][14][15]\n\nIn August 2003 Simon agreed to reveal the name of the song's subject to the\nhighest bidder of the [Martha's Vineyard](/wiki/Martha%27s_Vineyard \"Martha's\nVineyard\") Possible Dreams charity auction. With the top bid of $50,000, [Dick\nEbersol](/wiki/Dick_Ebersol \"Dick Ebersol\"), president of [NBC\nSports](/wiki/NBC_Sports \"NBC Sports\") and a friend of Simon, won the right to\nknow the name of the subject of \"You're So Vain\". A condition of the prize was\nthat Ebersol not reveal the name.[16] Ebersol said Simon allowed him to\ndivulge a clue about the person's name: \"Carly told me that I could offer up\nto the entire world a clue as to what she'll tell me when we have this night\nin about two weeks. And the clue is: The letter 'E' is in the person's\nname.\"[17]\n\nIn 2004 Simon told [Regis Philbin](/wiki/Regis_Philbin \"Regis Philbin\"), \"If I\ntell it, it's going to come out in dribs and drabs. And I've given out two\nletters already, an 'A' and an 'E.' But I'm going to add one to it. I'm going\nto add an 'R,' in honor of you.\"[12]\n\nIn 2005 Simon's ex-husband Jim Hart said he was sure that the song was not\nabout anyone famous.[18]\n\nOn June 19, 2008, [Howard Stern](/wiki/Howard_Stern \"Howard Stern\") stated\nthat Simon had privately revealed to him about whom the song was written after\nher interview on his popular radio show on [Sirius Satellite\nRadio](/wiki/Sirius_Satellite_Radio \"Sirius Satellite Radio\"). Stern\ncommented, \"There is an odd aspect to it... he's not that vain.\" On March 17,\n2009, Stern stated that she had said it was a \"composite of three people.\"\nStern repeated this on May 5, 2014, stating, \"She takes me aside, pulls me\nclose, whispers in my ear... three names. She goes, it wasn't one person, it\nwas three people.\"[19] Simon herself confirmed that Stern was among \"a few\npeople\" that she had given the names to.[20]\n\nIn her 2008 book _Girls Like Us_ , author Sheila Weller includes a detailed\naccount of Simon's love affair with musician [Dan\nArmstrong](/wiki/Dan_Armstrong \"Dan Armstrong\"), and suggests that he was the\ninspiration for \"You're So Vain.\" Her heartbreak over eventually losing him\ninspired the song \"Dan, My Fling,\" which appears on her first album.[21]\nArmstrong's full name, Daniel Kent Armstrong, contains all three letters of\nSimon's clue.\n\nOn November 4, 2009, Simon said she had hidden the name of the subject in a\ncertain version of the song. The next day, the program's crew revealed the\nname concealed in a back-played whisper:[22] David. Simon denied that the\nwhisper was \"David,\" saying she had spoken \"Ovid\" both forwards and backwards,\nand that sounded like David.[23] In February 2010, Simon reiterated that the\nname of the subject was whispered in a re-recording of \"You're So Vain\":\n\"There's a little whisper—and it's the answer to the puzzle.\"[24] A\nrepresentative for Simon confirmed that the name whispered during the song is\n\"David\".[24] Multiple media outlets then speculated that the subject was\nSimon's former boss at [Elektra](/wiki/Elektra_Records \"Elektra Records\"),\n[David Geffen](/wiki/David_Geffen \"David Geffen\").[25] The following day Jim\nHart, Simon's ex-husband and close friend, denied that the song was about\nGeffen.[7] Simon said that when she wrote the song in 1971, she had not yet\nmet Geffen.[26] Simon's publicist also confirmed the song was not about\nGeffen, but that there was indeed \"a David who is connected to the song in\nsome way, shape, or form\".[7] _[Vanity Fair](/wiki/Vanity_Fair_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Vanity Fair \\(magazine\\)\")_ noted that in addition to \"David\", \"Warren\" and\nan unintelligible name are whispered during the recording.[27]\n\nAfter her live performance of the song with Simon in July 2013, [Taylor\nSwift](/wiki/Taylor_Swift \"Taylor Swift\") stated that Simon had revealed the\nidentity of the song's subject to her in confidence.[28]\n\nIn November 2015, Simon, promoting her about-to-be-published memoir, said, \"I\nhave confirmed that the second verse is Warren (Beatty)\" and added that while\n\"Warren thinks the whole thing is about him,\" he is the subject of that verse\nonly, with the remainder of the song referring to two other, still unnamed\nmen.[3]\n\n## References in the\nsong[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27re_So_Vain&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: References in the song\")]\n\n  * [Gavotte](/wiki/Gavotte \"Gavotte\") — used in the line \"You had one eye in the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte\" — is a French kissing dance. In this context it can be taken to mean moving in a pretentious manner.[29]\n  * Simon said the line \"clouds in my coffee\" came \"from an airplane flight that I took with Billy Mernit, who was my friend and piano player at the time. As I got my coffee, there were clouds outside the window of the airplane and you could see the reflection in the cup of coffee. Billy said to me, 'Look at the clouds in your coffee'.\"[30]\n  * The line \"I hear you went up to Saratoga and your horse naturally won\" refers to the [Saratoga Race Course](/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course \"Saratoga Race Course\") horse-racing season held in late July, August, and early September in [Saratoga Springs, New York](/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York \"Saratoga Springs, New York\"). The season is frequented by the rich and famous of New York and other East Coast cities.[31]\n  * Two [solar eclipses](/wiki/Solar_eclipse \"Solar eclipse\") (\"Then you flew your Lear jet up to [Nova Scotia](/wiki/Nova_Scotia \"Nova Scotia\") to see the total eclipse of the sun\") were visible from Nova Scotia in the early 1970s, on [March 7, 1970](/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_March_7,_1970 \"Solar eclipse of March 7, 1970\"),[32] and [July 10, 1972](/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_July_10,_1972 \"Solar eclipse of July 10, 1972\").[33] Simon said she wrote the song in 1971, but the 1972 eclipse (which could only be seen in Nova Scotia as opposed to the 1970 eclipse which traversed the entire East Coast, and also happened during the Saratoga racing season) better fits the narrative.\n\n## Later versions and\nadaptations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27re_So_Vain&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Later versions and adaptations\")]\n\n  * The song has been recorded by [Chocolate Starfish](/wiki/Chocolate_Starfish \"Chocolate Starfish\"), [The Mountain Goats](/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats \"The Mountain Goats\"), [David Axelrod](/wiki/David_Axelrod_\\(musician\\) \"David Axelrod \\(musician\\)\"), [John Barrowman](/wiki/John_Barrowman \"John Barrowman\"), [Liza Minnelli](/wiki/Liza_Minnelli \"Liza Minnelli\"), [Jack Klugman](/wiki/Jack_Klugman \"Jack Klugman\") and [Tony Randall](/wiki/Tony_Randall \"Tony Randall\") (as [\"The Odd Couple\"](/wiki/The_Odd_Couple_\\(1970_TV_series\\) \"The Odd Couple \\(1970 TV series\\)\")), Chimira, Venice, [The Feeling](/wiki/The_Feeling \"The Feeling\"), [Jann Arden](/wiki/Jann_Arden \"Jann Arden\"), [Janet Jackson](/wiki/Janet_Jackson \"Janet Jackson\") (who sampled the song in \"[Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)](/wiki/Son_of_a_Gun_\\(I_Betcha_Think_This_Song_Is_About_You\\) \"Son of a Gun \\(I Betcha Think This Song Is About You\\)\")\", with Simon providing featured vocals), [Trey Songz](/wiki/Trey_Songz \"Trey Songz\") (who sampled from Janet Jackson in his single \"About You),\" [Anna Waronker](/wiki/Anna_Waronker \"Anna Waronker\"), [Faster Pussycat](/wiki/Faster_Pussycat \"Faster Pussycat\"), [Dres](/wiki/Dres_\\(rapper\\) \"Dres \\(rapper\\)\"), [Daryll-Ann](/wiki/Daryll-Ann \"Daryll-Ann\"), [Smokie](/wiki/Smokie_\\(band\\) \"Smokie \\(band\\)\"), [Sally Seltmann](/wiki/Sally_Seltmann \"Sally Seltmann\"), [Asaro and Wolcott](/wiki/Donald_Wolcott#Current_work \"Donald Wolcott\"), [Matthew Sweet](/wiki/Matthew_Sweet \"Matthew Sweet\") and [Susanna Hoffs](/wiki/Susanna_Hoffs \"Susanna Hoffs\"), [Marilyn Manson](/wiki/Marilyn_Manson_\\(band\\) \"Marilyn Manson \\(band\\)\") (featuring [Johnny Depp](/wiki/Johnny_Depp \"Johnny Depp\")),[34] and Italian pop star [Mina](/wiki/Mina_Mazzini \"Mina Mazzini\") in her 1985 album _[Finalmente ho conosciuto il conte Dracula...](/wiki/Finalmente_ho_conosciuto_il_conte_Dracula... \"Finalmente ho conosciuto il conte Dracula...\")_.\n  * [Foo Fighters](/wiki/Foo_Fighters \"Foo Fighters\") performed the song live at the [50th Annual Grammy Awards](/wiki/50th_Annual_Grammy_Awards \"50th Annual Grammy Awards\") in 2008.\n  * On July 27, 2013, Simon performed \"You're So Vain\" with [Taylor Swift](/wiki/Taylor_Swift \"Taylor Swift\") on her [Red Tour](/wiki/Red_Tour \"Red Tour\").[35]\n  * The song \"[Starfuckers, Inc.](/wiki/Starfuckers,_Inc. \"Starfuckers, Inc.\")\" by [Nine Inch Nails](/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails \"Nine Inch Nails\"), released in 2000, references \"You're So Vain\", by quoting the chorus.\n  * Supporters of English football team [Everton F.C.](/wiki/Everton_F.C. \"Everton F.C.\") sang the song to player [Leighton Baines](/wiki/Leighton_Baines \"Leighton Baines\") at the 2009 football matches.[36][37]\n  * On their 2009 album _[Felony](/wiki/Felony_\\(album\\) \"Felony \\(album\\)\")_ , [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") metalcore band [Emmure](/wiki/Emmure \"Emmure\") had a song titled \"R2Deepthroat\" where vocalist Frankie says \"You're so vain, I bet you think this song is about you, don't you?\"\n  * In the lead-up to the [2016 US presidential election](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016 \"United States presidential election, 2016\"), Simon authorized the use of the song in an ad against [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\").[38]\n  * In a piece posted by [BBC News](/wiki/BBC_News \"BBC News\") on May 5, 2017, Simon sings a previously unreleased fourth verse to the song, which she states had been written on a pad some time ago but never made it into the song. It references a man, married multiple times, who \"called her once to ask her things she couldn't quite divine\".[39]\n  * On the October, 3, 2017, episode of the reality television singing competition program _[The Voice](/wiki/The_Voice_\\(U.S._series\\) \"The Voice \\(U.S. series\\)\")_ , Karli Webster performed a shortened version of the song for a Blind Audition, which turned the chairs of prospective coaches [Adam Levine](/wiki/Adam_Levine \"Adam Levine\") and [Miley Cyrus](/wiki/Miley_Cyrus \"Miley Cyrus\"). (The full version of Webster's rendition, even today, is available for purchase and download on [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\").)

The song was re-\nreleased in the UK in 1991 to cash in on its inclusion in a commercial for\n[Dunlop Tyres](/wiki/Dunlop_Tyres \"Dunlop Tyres\"), peaking at number 41.\n\n### Weekly\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27re_So_Vain&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Weekly charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1972–1973)  | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nAustralia ([Kent Music Report](/wiki/Kent_Music_Report \"Kent Music Report\"))[41] | 1   \nBelgium ([Ultratop 50](/wiki/Ultratop_50 \"Ultratop 50\") Flanders)[42] | 5   \nCanada Top Singles (_[RPM](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\")_)[43] | 1   \nCanada Adult Contemporary (_[RPM](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\")_)[44] | 1   \nGermany ([Official German Charts](/wiki/GfK_Entertainment_Charts \"GfK Entertainment Charts\"))[42] | 8   \nIreland ([IRMA](/wiki/Irish_Singles_Chart \"Irish Singles Chart\"))[45] | 4   \nNetherlands ([Single Top 100](/wiki/Single_Top_100 \"Single Top 100\"))[42] | 7   \nNew Zealand (_[Listener](/wiki/New_Zealand_Listener \"New Zealand Listener\")_)[46] | 1   \nSouth Africa ([Springbok Radio](/wiki/Springbok_Radio \"Springbok Radio\"))[47] | 4   \nUK Singles ([Official Chart Company](/wiki/Official_Chart_Company \"Official Chart Company\"))[48] | 3   \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[49] | 1   \nUS [Adult Contemporary](/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_\\(chart\\) \"Adult Contemporary \\(chart\\)\") (_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_)[50] | 1   \n  \n### Year-end\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27re_So_Vain&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Year-end charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1973)  | Position   \n---|---  \nAustralia (Kent Music Report)[51] | 3   \nCanada Top Singles (_RPM_)[52] | 8   \nUS _Billboard_ Hot 100[53] | 9   \nUS _Cash Box_ Top 100[54] | 7   \n  \n### All-time\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27re_So_Vain&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: All-time charts\")]\n\nChart (1958-2018)  | Position   \n---|---  \nUS [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[55] | 92   \n  \n## Awards[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27re_So_Vain&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Awards\")]\n\nYear  | Nominee/work  | Award  | Result   \n---|---|---|---  \n1974  | \"You're So Vain\" | [Record of the Year](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Record_of_the_Year \"Grammy Award for Record of the Year\") | Nominated   \n[Song of the Year](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Song_of_the_Year \"Grammy Award for Song of the Year\") | Nominated   \n[Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Female_Pop_Vocal_Performance \"Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\") | Nominated   \n2004  | [Grammy Hall of Fame Award](/wiki/Grammy_Hall_of_Fame_Award \"Grammy Hall of Fame Award\") | Inducted   \n  \n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27re_So_Vain&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1973](/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_number-one_singles_of_1973 \"List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1973\")\n  * [List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1973 (U.S.)](/wiki/List_of_number-one_adult_contemporary_singles_of_1973_\\(U.S.\\) \"List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1973 \\(U.S.\\)\")\n  * [List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1970s](/wiki/List_of_number-one_singles_in_Australia_during_the_1970s#1973 \"List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1970s\")\n  * [List of RPM number-one singles of 1973](/wiki/List_of_RPM_number-one_singles_of_1973 \"List of RPM number-one singles of 1973\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=You%27re_So_Vain&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Archived copy\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20131111090530/http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/music-softrockstars/14/).
