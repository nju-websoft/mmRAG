In\n[fish](/wiki/Fish \"Fish\"), the divisions of the small intestine are not as\nclear and the terms **posterior intestine** or **distal intestine** may be\nused instead of ileum.[2]\n\nThe ileum follows the [duodenum](/wiki/Duodenum \"Duodenum\") and\n[jejunum](/wiki/Jejunum \"Jejunum\") and is separated from the\n[cecum](/wiki/Cecum \"Cecum\") by the [ileocecal valve](/wiki/Ileocecal_valve\n\"Ileocecal valve\") (ICV). In humans, the ileum is about 2–4 m long, and the\n[pH](/wiki/PH \"PH\") is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline).\n\n_Ileum_ is derived from the Greek word _eilein_ , meaning \"to twist up\ntightly.\"[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Structure\n    * 1.1 Histology\n    * 1.2 Development\n  * 2 Function\n  * 3 Clinical significance\n  * 4 Other animals\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Structure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ileum&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Structure\")]\n\nThe ileum is the third and final part of the small intestine. It follows the\n[jejunum](/wiki/Jejunum \"Jejunum\") and ends at the ileocecal junction, where\nthe [terminal](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/terminal \"wiktionary:terminal\")\nileum communicates with the [cecum](/wiki/Cecum \"Cecum\") of the large\nintestine through the [ileocecal valve](/wiki/Ileocecal_valve \"Ileocecal\nvalve\"). The ileum, along with the jejunum, is suspended inside the\n[mesentery](/wiki/Mesentery \"Mesentery\"), a [peritoneal](/wiki/Peritoneum\n\"Peritoneum\") formation that carries the blood vessels supplying them (the\n[superior mesenteric artery](/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_artery \"Superior\nmesenteric artery\") and [vein](/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_vein \"Superior\nmesenteric vein\")), lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers.[3]\n\nThere is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum. There are,\nhowever, subtle differences between the two:[3]\n\n  * The ileum has more fat inside the mesentery than the jejunum.\n  * The diameter of its [lumen](/wiki/Lumen_\\(anatomy\\) \"Lumen \\(anatomy\\)\") is smaller and has thinner walls than the jejunum.\n  * Its [circular folds](/wiki/Circular_folds \"Circular folds\") are smaller and absent in the terminal part of the ileum.\n  * While the length of the intestinal tract contains [lymphoid tissue](/wiki/Lymphoid_tissue \"Lymphoid tissue\"), only the ileum has abundant [Peyer's patches](/wiki/Peyer%27s_patches \"Peyer's patches\"), unencapsulated [lymphoid nodules](/wiki/Lymphoid_nodule \"Lymphoid nodule\") that contain large numbers of [lymphocytes](/wiki/Lymphocyte \"Lymphocyte\") and other cells of the [immune system](/wiki/Immune_system \"Immune system\").\n\n### Histology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ileum&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Histology\")]\n\nMain article: [Gastrointestinal wall](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_wall\n\"Gastrointestinal wall\")\n\nThe four layers that make up the wall of the ileum are consistent with those\nof the [gastrointestinal tract](/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract \"Human\ngastrointestinal tract\"). From the inner to the outer surface, these\nare:[4]:589\n\n  * A [mucous membrane](/wiki/Mucous_membrane \"Mucous membrane\"), itself formed by three different layers: \n    * A single layer of [tall cells](/wiki/Simple_columnar_epithelium \"Simple columnar epithelium\") that line the [lumen](/wiki/Lumen_\\(anatomy\\) \"Lumen \\(anatomy\\)\") of the organ. The [epithelium](/wiki/Epithelium \"Epithelium\") that forms the innermost part of the mucosa has five distinct types of cells that serve different purposes, these are: [enterocytes](/wiki/Enterocytes \"Enterocytes\") with [microvilli](/wiki/Microvilli \"Microvilli\"), which digest and absorb nutrients; [goblet cells](/wiki/Goblet_cell \"Goblet cell\"), which secrete [mucin](/wiki/Mucin \"Mucin\"), a substance that lubricates the wall of the organ; [Paneth cells](/wiki/Paneth_cell \"Paneth cell\"), most common in the terminal part of the ileum, are only found at the bottom of the [intestinal glands](/wiki/Intestinal_glands \"Intestinal glands\") and release antimicrobial substances such as [alpha defensins](/wiki/Alpha_defensin \"Alpha defensin\") and [lysozyme](/wiki/Lysozyme \"Lysozyme\");[5] [microfold cells](/wiki/Microfold_cells \"Microfold cells\"), which take up and transport [antigens](/wiki/Antigen \"Antigen\") from the lumen to lymphatic cells of the lamina propria; and [enteroendocrine cells](/wiki/Enteroendocrine_cell \"Enteroendocrine cell\"), which secrete [hormones](/wiki/Hormones \"Hormones\").\n    * An underlying [lamina propria](/wiki/Lamina_propria \"Lamina propria\") composed of [loose connective tissue](/wiki/Loose_connective_tissue \"Loose connective tissue\") and containing [germinal centers](/wiki/Germinal_center \"Germinal center\") and large aggregates of lymphoid tissue called [Peyer's patches](/wiki/Peyer%27s_patches \"Peyer's patches\"), which are a distinctive feature of the ileum.[4]:589\n    * A thin layer of [smooth muscle](/wiki/Smooth_muscle \"Smooth muscle\") called [muscularis mucosae](/wiki/Muscularis_mucosae \"Muscularis mucosae\").\n  * A [submucosa](/wiki/Submucosa \"Submucosa\") formed by [dense irregular connective tissue](/wiki/Dense_irregular_connective_tissue \"Dense irregular connective tissue\") that carries the larger [blood vessels](/wiki/Blood_vessels \"Blood vessels\") and a nervous component called [submucosal plexus](/wiki/Submucosal_plexus \"Submucosal plexus\"), which is part of the [enteric nervous system](/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system \"Enteric nervous system\").\n  * An [external muscular layer](/wiki/Muscularis_externa \"Muscularis externa\") formed by two layers of [smooth muscle](/wiki/Smooth_muscle \"Smooth muscle\") arranged in circular bundles in the inner layer and in longitudinal bundles in the outer layer. Between the two layers is the [myenteric plexus](/wiki/Myenteric_plexus \"Myenteric plexus\"), formed by nervous tissue and also a part of the [enteric nervous system](/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system \"Enteric nervous system\").\n  * A [serosa](/wiki/Serosa \"Serosa\") composed of [mesothelium](/wiki/Mesothelium \"Mesothelium\"), a single layer of [flat cells](/wiki/Simple_squamous_epithelium \"Simple squamous epithelium\") with varying quantities of underlying [connective](/wiki/Connective_tissue \"Connective tissue\") and [adipose tissue](/wiki/Adipose_tissue \"Adipose tissue\").

The\n[proximal](/wiki/Proximal \"Proximal\") half of this loop will form the ileum.\nThe loop grows so fast in length that it outgrows the abdomen and protrudes\nthrough the [umbilicus](/wiki/Navel \"Navel\"). By week 10, the loop retracts\nback into the abdomen. Between weeks six and ten the small intestine rotates\nanticlockwise, as viewed from the front of the embryo. It rotates a further\n180 degrees after it has moved back into the abdomen. This process creates the\ntwisted shape of the [large intestine](/wiki/Large_intestine \"Large\nintestine\").[6]\n\nIn the [fetus](/wiki/Fetus \"Fetus\") the ileum is connected to the\n[navel](/wiki/Navel \"Navel\") by the [vitelline duct](/wiki/Vitelline_duct\n\"Vitelline duct\"). In roughly 2−4% of humans, this duct fails to close during\nthe first seven weeks after birth, leaving a remnant called [Meckel's\ndiverticulum](/wiki/Meckel%27s_diverticulum \"Meckel's diverticulum\").[7]\n\n## Function[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ileum&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Function\")]\n\nThe function of the ileum is mainly to absorb [vitamin B12](/wiki/Vitamin_B12\n\"Vitamin B12\") and [bile salts](/wiki/Bile_salts \"Bile salts\") and whatever\nproducts of digestion were not absorbed by the jejunum. The wall itself is\nmade up of folds, each of which has many tiny finger-like projections known as\n[villi](/wiki/Intestinal_villus \"Intestinal villus\") on its surface. In turn,\nthe epithelial cells that line these villi possess even larger numbers of\n[microvilli](/wiki/Microvilli \"Microvilli\"). Therefore, the ileum has an\nextremely large surface area both for the [adsorption](/wiki/Adsorption\n\"Adsorption\") (attachment) of [enzyme](/wiki/Enzyme \"Enzyme\") molecules and\nfor the [absorption](/wiki/Absorption_\\(chemistry\\) \"Absorption\n\\(chemistry\\)\") of products of [digestion](/wiki/Digestion \"Digestion\"). The\nDNES (diffuse neuroendocrine system) cells of the ileum secrete various\nhormones (gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin) into the blood. Cells in the\nlining of the ileum secrete the [protease](/wiki/Protease \"Protease\") and\n[carbohydrase](/wiki/Carbohydrase \"Carbohydrase\") enzymes responsible for the\nfinal stages of [protein](/wiki/Protein \"Protein\") and\n[carbohydrate](/wiki/Carbohydrate \"Carbohydrate\") digestion into the\n[lumen](/wiki/Lumen_\\(anatomy\\) \"Lumen \\(anatomy\\)\") of the intestine. These\nenzymes are present in the [cytoplasm](/wiki/Cytoplasm \"Cytoplasm\") of the\n[epithelial cells](/wiki/Epithelial_cells \"Epithelial cells\").\n\nThe villi contain large numbers of capillaries that take the amino acids and\nglucose produced by digestion to the [hepatic portal\nvein](/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein \"Hepatic portal vein\") and the liver.\n[Lacteals](/wiki/Lacteals \"Lacteals\") are small lymph vessels, and are present\nin villi. They absorb [fatty acid](/wiki/Fatty_acid \"Fatty acid\") and\n[glycerol](/wiki/Glycerol \"Glycerol\"), the products of fat digestion. Layers\nof circular and longitudinal [smooth muscle](/wiki/Smooth_muscle \"Smooth\nmuscle\") enable the [chyme](/wiki/Chyme \"Chyme\") (partly digested food and\nwater) to be pushed along the ileum by waves of muscle contractions called\n[peristalsis](/wiki/Peristalsis \"Peristalsis\"). The remaining chyme is passed\nto the [colon](/wiki/Colon_\\(anatomy\\) \"Colon \\(anatomy\\)\").\n\n## Clinical significance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ileum&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Clinical significance\")]\n\nIt is of importance in medicine as it can be affected in a number of\ndiseases,[8] including:\n\n  * [Crohn's disease](/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease \"Crohn's disease\")\n  * [Tuberculosis](/wiki/Tuberculosis \"Tuberculosis\")\n  * [Lymphoma](/wiki/Lymphoma \"Lymphoma\")\n  * [Neuroendocrine tumours](/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumours \"Neuroendocrine tumours\") (carcinoid)\n\n## Other animals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ileum&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Other animals\")]\n\nIn veterinary anatomy, the ileum is distinguished from the jejunum by being\nthat portion of the jejunoileum that is connected to the [caecum](/wiki/Caecum\n\"Caecum\") by the [ileocecal fold](/wiki/Ileocecal_fold \"Ileocecal fold\").\n\nThe ileum is the short terminal part of the small intestine and forms the\nconnection to the large intestine. It is suspended by the caudal part of the\nmesentery (mesoileum) and is attached, in addition, to the cecum by the\nileocecal fold. The ileum terminates at the cecocolic junction of the large\nintestine forming the ileal orifice. In the dog the ileal orifice is located\nat the level of the first or second lumbar vertebra, in the ox in the level of\nthe fourth lumbar vertebrae, in the sheep and goat at the level of the caudal\npoint of the costal arch.[9] By active muscular contraction of the ileum, and\nclosure of the ileal opening as a result of engorgement, the ileum prevents\nthe backflow of ingesta and the equalization of pressure between jejunum and\nthe base of the cecum. Disturbance of this sensitive balance is not uncommon\nand is one of the causes of colic in horses. During any intestinal surgery,\nfor instance, during appendectomy, distal 2 feet of ileum should be checked\nfor the presence of Meckel's diverticulum.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ileum&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Physiology: 6/6ch2/s6ch2_30](http://humanphysiology.tuars.com/program/section6/6ch2/s6ch2_30.htm) \\- Essentials of Human Physiology\n  2. **Jump up ^** Guillaume, Jean; Praxis Publishing; Sadasivam Kaushik; Pierre Bergot; Robert Metailler (2001).
