With a goal in each leg by the Portuguese, Madrid won\nthe Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against\nBarcelona.[142] Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a\n\"professional issue\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his\n150th goal for Madrid,[143] his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting\na hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo La Coruña, he scored\nhis first [hat-trick in the Champions\nLeague](/wiki/List_of_UEFA_Champions_League_hat-tricks \"List of UEFA Champions\nLeague hat-tricks\") in a 4–1 victory over [Ajax](/wiki/AFC_Ajax \"AFC\nAjax\").[144] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six\nsuccessive _Clásicos_ when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou.[145] His\nperformances in 2012 again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the\n[FIFA Ballon d'Or](/wiki/2012_FIFA_Ballon_d%27Or \"2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or\"),\nfinishing runner-up to four-time winner Messi.[146]\n\n#### 2013–15: Consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or wins and _La Décima_\n\nFollowing the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Real Madrid for the\nfirst time in an official match, scoring a brace to lift 10-man Madrid to a\n4–3 victory over Real Sociedad on 6 January.[147] He subsequently became the\nfirst non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in _El Clásico_ on 30\nJanuary, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[148] Three days\nprior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick\nagainst Getafe.[149] Following hat-tricks against Celta Vigo and\nSevilla,[150][151] he scored his 200th goal for Real Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2\nwin against Málaga, reaching the landmark in 197 games.[152] He helped Madrid\nreach the [Copa del Rey final](/wiki/2013_Copa_del_Rey_Final \"2013 Copa del\nRey Final\") by scoring a brace in _El Clásico_ , which marked the sixth\nsuccessive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[153] a Real Madrid\nrecord.[142] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1\ndefeat to Atlético Madrid,[154] but was shown a straight red card in the 114th\nminute for violent conduct.[155] Real Madrid also failed to defend their La\nLiga title, finishing runners up to Barcelona.\n\nIn the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former\nclub Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a\n1–1 draw at the Santiago Bernabéu,[156] he scored the match-winning goal in a\n2–1 victory at Old Trafford, his first return to his former home ground.[157]\nRonaldo scored three goals in Madrid's 5–3 aggregate victory over\n[Galatasaray](/wiki/Galatasaray_S.K._\\(football\\) \"Galatasaray S.K.\n\\(football\\)\") to see them advance to the semi-finals,[158][159] He scored\nMadrid's only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to [Borussia\nDortmund](/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund \"Borussia Dortmund\"),[160] but failed to\nincrease his side's 2–0 victory in the second leg, as they were eliminated at\nthe semi-final stage for the third consecutive year.[161] Ronaldo had scored\n12 goals, finishing as the Champions League top goalscorer for a second time\nin his career.

In the knockout phase of the competition, he scored\na brace in each leg of a 9–2 aggregate win against [Schalke\n04](/wiki/FC_Schalke_04 \"FC Schalke 04\"),[174] helping Madrid advance to the\nquarter-finals. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Borussia Dortmund—his 100th\nChampions League match—took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling\nthe record Messi had set two years before.[175] After hitting a brace in a 4–0\ndefeat of Bayern Munich at the [Allianz Arena](/wiki/Allianz_Arena \"Allianz\nArena\"),[176] he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1\nfinal victory over Atlético Madrid, becoming the first player to score in two\nEuropean Cup finals for two different winning teams.[177] His overall\nperformance in the final was subdued as a result of [patellar\ntendinitis](/wiki/Patellar_tendinitis \"Patellar tendinitis\") and related\nhamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign.\nRonaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \"In your\nlife you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks.\"[178] As the\nChampions League top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17\ngoals,[179][180] he was named the [UEFA Best Player in\nEurope](/wiki/UEFA_Best_Player_in_Europe \"UEFA Best Player in Europe\").[181]\n\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the\n[final](/wiki/2014_Copa_del_Rey_Final \"2014 Copa del Rey Final\") by scoring a\nbrace of penalties against Atlético Madrid at the [Vicente\nCalderón](/wiki/Vicente_Calder%C3%B3n_Stadium \"Vicente Calderón\nStadium\"),[182] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single\nminute of a 90-minute football match.[183] His continued issues with his knee\nand thigh caused him to miss the final,[178][184] where Real Madrid defeated\nBarcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy.[185] While Madrid were less successful in\nLa Liga, finishing third, Ronaldo was unmatched as a goalscorer. He scored 31\ngoals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European\nGolden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker [Luis\nSuárez](/wiki/Luis_Su%C3%A1rez \"Luis Suárez\").[186] Among his haul was his\n400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a\nbrace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot\n[Eusébio](/wiki/Eus%C3%A9bio \"Eusébio\"), who had died two days before.[187] A\nlast-minute, backheeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May—his 50th goal\nin all competitions—was recognised as the best goal of the season by the [Liga\nde Fútbol Profesional](/wiki/Liga_de_F%C3%BAtbol_Profesional \"Liga de Fútbol\nProfesional\"),[188] which additionally named Ronaldo the [Best Player in La\nLiga](/wiki/LFP_Awards \"LFP Awards\").[189]\n\nDuring the next campaign, the [2014–15 season](/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_La_Liga\n\"2014–15 La Liga\"), Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals in all\ncompetitions, starting with both goals in Real Madrid's 2–0 victory over\nSevilla in the [UEFA Super Cup](/wiki/2014_UEFA_Super_Cup \"2014 UEFA Super\nCup\").[190][191] He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a\nleague campaign, with a record 15 goals in the first eight rounds of La Liga,\nincluding a four-goal haul against [Elche](/wiki/Elche_CF \"Elche CF\") and hat-\ntricks against Deportivo La Coruña and Athletic Bilbao.[192][193][194][195]\nHis record 23rd hat-trick in La Liga, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December,\nmade him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in the Spanish league, as he\nreached the milestone in only his 178th game.[195][196] After lifting the\n[FIFA Club World Cup](/wiki/2014_FIFA_Club_World_Cup \"2014 FIFA Club World\nCup\") with Madrid in Morocco,[197] again winning the Silver Ball,[198][199]\nRonaldo received a second successive [FIFA Ballon\nd'Or](/wiki/2014_FIFA_Ballon_d%27Or \"2014 FIFA Ballon d'Or\"),[200] joining\n[Johan Cruyff](/wiki/Johan_Cruyff \"Johan Cruyff\"), [Michel\nPlatini](/wiki/Michel_Platini \"Michel Platini\"), and [Marco van\nBasten](/wiki/Marco_van_Basten \"Marco van Basten\") as a three-time Ballon d'Or\nwinner.[201]\n\n#### 2015–17: All-time Real Madrid top scorer and _La Undécima_\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Ronaldo_vs._FC_Schalke_04_%2816854146922%29.jpg/170px-\nRonaldo_vs._FC_Schalke_04_%2816854146922%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ronaldo_vs._FC_Schalke_04_\\(16854146922\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ronaldo_vs._FC_Schalke_04_\\(16854146922\\).jpg \"Powiększ\")\n\nRonaldo scored a personal best of 61 goals in all competitions during the\n2014–15 season.\n\nFollowing the winter break, Ronaldo's form faltered, concurrently with a\ndecline in performance by his team.[202] A 2–1 defeat against Valencia in the\nfirst match of 2015, despite his opening goal, ended Real Madrid's Spanish\nrecord winning streak of 22 matches in all competitions.[203] Their season\ncontinued unsuccessfully as they failed to win a major trophy, earning a\nsecond-place league finish and a semi-final exit in Europe.[204] In the latter\ncompetition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches\nwith his strike in a 2–0 win against Schalke 04,[205] before hitting a brace\nin the 3–4 return defeat that allowed Madrid to progress to the quarter-\nfinals.[206] He then scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals\nagainst [Juventus](/wiki/Juventus_F.C. \"Juventus F.C.\"), where Madrid were\neliminated 2–3 on aggregate.[207] With 10 goals, he finished the campaign as\ntop scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and\n[Neymar](/wiki/Neymar \"Neymar\").[208]\n\nIn La Liga, where Madrid finished second, Ronaldo went on a prolific\ngoalscoring run towards the very end of the season.

Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney\nwas sent off for stamping on Portugal defender [Ricardo\nCarvalho](/wiki/Ricardo_Carvalho \"Ricardo Carvalho\"). Although the referee\nlater clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction,[294]\nthe English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by\naggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at\nPortugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal.[295] Ronaldo went on to score\nthe vital winning penalty during the penalty shoot out which sent Portugal\ninto the semi-finals.[296] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0\nsemi-final defeat to [France](/wiki/France_national_football_team \"France\nnational football team\").[297] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for\nthe tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to\n[Germany](/wiki/Germany_national_football_team \"Germany national football\nteam\")'s [Lukas Podolski](/wiki/Lukas_Podolski \"Lukas Podolski\"), citing his\nbehaviour as a factor in the decision.[298] Following the 2006 World Cup,\nRonaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro\n2008, scoring two goals in the process.[299][300]\n\n### 2007–12: Assuming the captaincy\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Cristiano_Ronaldo_20120609.jpg/170px-\nCristiano_Ronaldo_20120609.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cristiano_Ronaldo_20120609.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cristiano_Ronaldo_20120609.jpg \"Powiększ\")\n\nRonaldo, pictured playing against\n[Germany](/wiki/Germany_national_football_team \"Germany national football\nteam\") at [Euro 2012](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012 \"UEFA Euro 2012\"), was made captain\nin 2008.\n\nOne day after his 22nd birthday, Ronaldo\n[captained](/wiki/List_of_Portugal_national_football_team_captains \"List of\nPortugal national football team captains\") Portugal for the first time in a\nfriendly game against [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team \"Brazil\nnational football team\") on 6 February 2007,[301] as requested by [Portuguese\nFootball Federation](/wiki/Portuguese_Football_Federation \"Portuguese Football\nFederation\") president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier.[302] Ahead\nof [Euro 2008](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2008 \"UEFA Euro 2008\"), he was given the number\n7 shirt for the first time.[303] While he scored eight goals in the\n[qualification](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2008_qualification \"UEFA Euro 2008\nqualification\"),[304] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the\ntournament, netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match\nagainst the [Czech Republic](/wiki/Czech_Republic_national_football_team\n\"Czech Republic national football team\");
