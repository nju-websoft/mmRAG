On July 6, 2010, Endemol USA announced that they had entered into a\npartnership with [Entertainment One](/wiki/Entertainment_One \"Entertainment\nOne\"), which would serve as the production studio on the project.[8]\n\nPart of the deal between the two companies included provisions of\ninternational distribution, with Endemol retaining rights to the series across\n[Europe](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\"), while Entertainment One acquired rights to\n_Hell on Wheels_ in all remaining territories.[8] As a result of the deal,\nEntertainment One also holds global rights for DVD and Blu-ray sales, as well\nas video-on-demand and other digital distribution services.[8] The Canadian\nproduction company Nomadic Pictures was brought onto the project to serve as\nco-producers alongside Entertainment One.[9] The pilot was delivered to AMC\nexecutives in November 2010.[9]\n\nOn November 12, 2010 it was reported by _[Deadline](/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood\n\"Deadline Hollywood\")_ that the executives at AMC were impressed with the\npilot, and, coupled with the fact that the network had just cancelled their\ndrama series, _[Rubicon](/wiki/Rubicon_\\(TV_series\\) \"Rubicon \\(TV series\\)\")_\n, were likely to order _Hell on Wheels_ to series.[9]\n\nOn December 15, 2010, AMC [green-lighted](/wiki/Green-light \"Green-light\") the\nseries with an order of 10 episodes.[10][11][12] Along with the series pickup,\nAMC announced that Nomadic Pictures would again co-produce the series, as they\nhad done for the pilot, with Mike Frislev and Chad Oakes joining the series as\nproducers, while John Shiban and David Von Ancken joined the series as\nexecutive producers; Von Ancken had previously served as director on the\npilot.[12][13] The network also announced that John Morayniss and Michael\nRosenberg would oversee production for Entertainment One, while Joel\nStillerman and Susie Fitzgerald would oversee production for AMC.[12][13]\n\nOn July 28, 2011, AMC announced that _Hell on Wheels_ would premiere on\nNovember 6, 2011.[2] The series is produced by Entertainment One and Nomadic\nPictures.\n\nOn November 8, 2011, co-creator Joe Gayton spoke of the series' origins: \"We\n[Tony and I] started talking and remembered this story, _[American\nExperience](/wiki/American_Experience \"American Experience\")_ , which was this\nreally great documentary, and I thought, 'God, that’s great. I just learned a\nbunch of stuff I had never learned before.' You just have this cursory\ninformation that the Chinese and the Irish built the railroad, but it got in\nunderneath all the dirt and stuff that went on, with the financing of it, and\nthe greed and corruption. And then, I heard about this Hell on Wheels place\nand I went, 'What a great setting for a western.' So, we pitched that to\nJeremy Gold [at Endemol] and ended up taking it to AMC, and they loved it,\" he\nsaid.[14]\n\nOn October 29, 2012, AMC renewed _Hell on Wheels_ for a third season,[15]\nhowever it was also announced that the series creators and showrunners, Joe\nand Tony Gayton, \"will no longer be involved day-to-day on the show\" and\nseries producer/writer/director [John Shiban](/wiki/John_Shiban \"John Shiban\")\nwould take over.[3] Following the departure of Shiban, the renewal was put on\nhold until a replacement could be found.[16] On December 12, 2012, AMC\nannounced that [John Wirth](/wiki/John_Wirth_\\(television_producer\\) \"John\nWirth \\(television producer\\)\"), a writer for _[Terminator: The Sarah Connor\nChronicles](/wiki/Terminator:_The_Sarah_Connor_Chronicles \"Terminator: The\nSarah Connor Chronicles\")_ , will be the new showrunner, starting with the\nshow's third season.[17]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hell_on_Wheels_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Hell-On-\nWheels-350x192.jpg/220px-Hell-On-Wheels-350x192.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hell-On-\nWheels-350x192.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hell-On-Wheels-350x192.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) is the central character of the series.\n\nCasting announcements began in July 2010, with\n[Common](/wiki/Common_\\(rapper\\) \"Common \\(rapper\\)\") first to be cast.

And for me, I felt like I owed it to the people that lived\nduring that time to bring something truthful to the character. And even just\nrevisiting some of the experiences of it, [there] was just a lot of emotion\nand a lot of pain. At the same time, a lot of strength came from it. What I\nenjoy most about the character is the fact that he was written so strong, not\nas just a person that was oppressed and kept his head down.\"[29]\n\nCanadian actor [Christopher Heyerdahl](/wiki/Christopher_Heyerdahl\n\"Christopher Heyerdahl\") talks about how he got his role and the rarity of a\nScandinavian character: \"Well, luck and providence, I suppose. They say,\n'What’s luck? Preparation and opportunity.' So, I guess the opportunity came,\nin the form of an audition. I put myself on tape, and they responded to it. I\nwent in and did a call-back audition, and they felt that we were on the same\ntrack. My idea of who The Swede was, was the same as theirs, and vice versa.\nThis kind of character is very rare, with the fact that it fit so well with my\nbackground and my understanding of a Norwegian man. It all just fell into\nplace. I still get a little choked up thinking about how often a character\nlike this comes along. For the viewer, it’s quite interesting. It’s not a\ncharacter that we see very often, and certainly not in this form. As an actor,\nit seemed to be tailor-made for me. It’s quite wonderful.\"[30]\n\nIrish actress [Dominique McElligott](/wiki/Dominique_McElligott \"Dominique\nMcElligott\") never expected to be cast in a period American role: \"I was\nhanging out in London, having drinks with friends who are all flight\nattendants, and they said that they would get me over to America for free, and\nI could stay and do some meetings and auditions. _Hell on Wheels_ was the\nfirst one. I arrived on the 5th of July, and the _Hell on Wheels_ audition was\non the 6th or the 7th. It was crazy! They didn’t know me, at all. Obviously, I\nloved the pilot and I loved the character, but I didn’t anticipate ever\nactually getting the chance to do it. When you go up for these brilliant\nparts, you just figure, 'Okay, well, they’re going to pick some American\nactress, and that will be that.' But, the opportunity was there, and I really\nenjoyed the audition.

Interior filming was in a building near the city's\nairport. Series producers expected the filming of the season's ten episodes to\ntake about 80 days.[1]\n\nFilming of the third season was suspended part way through the sixth episode\nwhen the location was included in the mandatory evacuation area due to the\n[flooding in southern Alberta](/wiki/2013_Alberta_floods \"2013 Alberta\nfloods\").[34] Originally, producers had announced a two-day shut down, when\nthe only road to the location was underwater.[35] Later, on June 21, producers\nannounced that the production hiatus, scheduled to begin June 27, would take\neffect immediately.[34] Anson Mount shared pictures of the nearby river and\nexterior sets flooding on June 20 and 21.[34][36][37]\n\nFilming of the fourth season's 13 episodes took place along the Bow River.\nFilming occurred from April 24 to September 24, 2014.[38]\n\nThe fifth season's production filming occurred on the CL Ranch, west of\nCalgary, for the [Truckee, California](/wiki/Truckee,_California \"Truckee,\nCalifornia\"), and [Laramie, Wyoming](/wiki/Laramie,_Wyoming \"Laramie,\nWyoming\"), locations.

Though imbued with epic sweep, _Hell on\nWheels_ is a western at heart, even if that heart is cold. Plenty of guns,\nknives, arrows, scalpings – mixed with the incendiary socio-psychological\nwounds left in the Civil War’s wake.\"[42]\n\nRobert Lloyd of the _[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles\nTimes\")_ says the show \"...takes its cues more from the movies than from life.\nNever, in the episodes I watched, did I feel as if I were actually seeing how\na railroad got built, and sometimes it took a bit of squinting not to see the\ncharacters as actors in a field, reading lines. Still, for all the unlikely\nthings [the creators] make happen in order to get their characters into place,\nand the dogged refusal of a couple of those characters to become interesting\nat all, the show gathers steam as it goes on.\"[43]\n\nThe _[Wall Street Journal](/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal \"Wall Street Journal\")_\n's Nancy Dewolf Smith comments: \" 'Hell on Wheels' finds enough beauty, danger\nand emotion to make some part of every episode seem fresh and worth waiting\nfor. Not that new is always a good thing. Despite striking performances even\nin many of the smaller roles, the actors sometimes are made to symbolize very\nmodern obsessions, e.g. with race and gender. The sight of modern\nsensibilities lurking behind the curtains can break ye olde spell.\"[44]\n\nBrian Lowry of _[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_\nwrites: \"While the diverse mix of characters could work to the program's\nadvantage over the long haul, jumping to and fro among them creates a diluted,\nherky-jerky ride in the early going.\"[45]\n\nThe _[Washington Post](/wiki/Washington_Post \"Washington Post\")_ reported that\nthe series has been criticized for not depicting [Chinese\nimmigrants](/wiki/Chinese_American#Influence_on_American_culture \"Chinese\nAmerican\") during the transcontinental railroad construction scenes. Creator\nJoe Gayton said \"budget-wise and time-wise . . . we could really only\nconcentrate on one side of [the railroad building], and that’s probably why\nwe, you know, that's why we chose the [emanating from the East Coast] Union\nPacific as opposed to the [emanating from the West Coast] Central\nPacific.\"[46] By the fifth season, the show expanded its focus to include a\nsignificant look at the role of Chinese immigrant workers in the growth of the\nrailroad.\n\n###\nRatings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hell_on_Wheels_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Ratings\")]\n\nThe pilot, premiering November 6. 2011, was watched by 4.4 million viewers –\nAMC's second-highest series premiere in history, following _[The Walking\nDead](/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Walking Dead \\(TV series\\)\")_.\nAmong key demographics, the pilot episode was viewed by 2.4 million viewers in\nthe adults 18–49 category, and 2.3 million viewers in the adults 25–54\ndemographics, according to Nielsen.
