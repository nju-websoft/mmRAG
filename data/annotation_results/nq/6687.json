Released by [20th Century\nFox](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox \"20th Century Fox\"), the film starred [Adam\nWest](/wiki/Adam_West \"Adam West\") as Batman and [Burt Ward](/wiki/Burt_Ward\n\"Burt Ward\") as [Robin](/wiki/Robin_\\(comics\\) \"Robin \\(comics\\)\"). The film\nhit theaters two months after the [last episode of the first\nseason](/wiki/List_of_Batman_television_episodes#Season_1:_1966 \"List of\nBatman television episodes\") of the television series. The film includes most\nmembers of the original TV cast, with the exception of [Lee\nMeriwether](/wiki/Lee_Meriwether \"Lee Meriwether\") as the Catwoman, the\ncharacter previously played by [Julie Newmar](/wiki/Julie_Newmar \"Julie\nNewmar\") in two episodes of the series' first season.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Tone\n    * 3.2 Vehicles\n  * 4 Soundtrack\n  * 5 Release\n  * 6 Reception\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Plot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batman_\\(1966_film\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nWhen Batman and Robin get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp is in danger aboard\nhis yacht, they launch a rescue mission using the [Batcopter](/wiki/Batcopter\n\"Batcopter\"). As Batman descends on the bat-ladder to land on the yacht, it\nsuddenly vanishes beneath him. He rises out of the sea with a shark attacking\nhis leg. After Batman dislodges it with bat-[shark\nrepellent](/wiki/Shark_repellent \"Shark repellent\"), the shark explodes.\nBatman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce\nthat the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the\nmost powerful villains in [Gotham City](/wiki/Gotham_City \"Gotham City\") ([The\nJoker](/wiki/Joker_\\(character\\) \"Joker \\(character\\)\"), [The\nPenguin](/wiki/Penguin_\\(character\\) \"Penguin \\(character\\)\"), [The\nRiddler](/wiki/Riddler \"Riddler\"), and [The Catwoman](/wiki/Catwoman\n\"Catwoman\")).\n\nThe United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans\ninto dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware that he has been\nkidnapped), a submarine made to resemble a [penguin](/wiki/Penguin \"Penguin\"),\nand their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). It is revealed\nthe yacht was really a projection. When Batman and Robin return to a buoy\nconcealing a projector, they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted\nby torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a\nporpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. The Catwoman, disguised\nas [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") journalist \"Miss Kitka\", helps\nthe group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of\na plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of the Penguin's\nexplosive animals (not knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After\nBruce Wayne escapes captivity, the Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore\nand schemes his way into the [Batcave](/wiki/Batcave \"Batcave\") along with\nfive dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly\ndisappear into [antimatter](/wiki/Antimatter \"Antimatter\") once struck: The\nPenguin mistakenly rehydrated them with [heavy water](/wiki/Heavy_water \"Heavy\nwater\"), used to recharge the Batcave's [atomic pile](/wiki/Atomic_pile\n\"Atomic pile\").\n\nUltimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the\ndehydrated [United World Organization's Security\nCouncil](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council \"United Nations Security\nCouncil\"). Giving chase in the [batboat](/wiki/Batboat \"Batboat\") to retrieve\nthem (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a\nsonic charge weapon to disable Penguin's submarine and force it to surface,\nwhere a fist fight ensues. Although Batman and Robin win the fight, Batman is\nheartbroken to find out that his \"true love\" Miss Kitka is actually the\nCatwoman when her mask falls off. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the\nvials containing the powdered Council members, mixing them together.\n\nBatman sets to work, constructing an elaborate filter to separate the mingled\ndust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world's best interests for\nthem to alter the dust samples, so that humans can no longer harm one another.\nIn response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate\nof the Penguin's henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for\npeople in general to learn to live together peacefully on their own.\n\nWith the world watching, the [Security Council](/wiki/Security_Council\n\"Security Council\") is re-hydrated. All of the members are restored alive and\nwell, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their\nsurroundings, but each of them now speaks the language and displays the\nstereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly\nexpresses his sincere hope to Robin that this \"mixing of minds\" does more good\nthan it does harm. The duo quietly leave [United World\nHeadquarters](/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters \"United Nations Headquarters\")\nby climbing out of the window and descending on their batropes.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batman_\\(1966_film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Batman_villains_The_Penguin_The_Riddler_The_Joker_1967.JPG/180px-\nBatman_villains_The_Penguin_The_Riddler_The_Joker_1967.JPG)](/wiki/File:Batman_villains_The_Penguin_The_Riddler_The_Joker_1967.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Batman_villains_The_Penguin_The_Riddler_The_Joker_1967.JPG\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Penguin ([Burgess Meredith](/wiki/Burgess_Meredith \"Burgess Meredith\")),\nthe Riddler ([Frank Gorshin](/wiki/Frank_Gorshin \"Frank Gorshin\")) and the\nJoker ([Cesar Romero](/wiki/Cesar_Romero \"Cesar Romero\")) in 1966.

Though [Julie Newmar](/wiki/Julie_Newmar\n\"Julie Newmar\") had at this point played [Catwoman](/wiki/Catwoman \"Catwoman\")\nin two episodes of [season\none](/wiki/List_of_Batman_television_episodes#Season_1:_1966 \"List of Batman\ntelevision episodes\") in the [TV series](/wiki/Batman_\\(TV_series\\) \"Batman\n\\(TV series\\)\"), she had other commitments at that time[5] and was replaced by\n[Lee Meriwether](/wiki/Lee_Meriwether \"Lee Meriwether\") in the film. According\nto the [Biography](/wiki/Biography_\\(TV_Series\\) \"Biography \\(TV Series\\)\")\nspecial [Catwoman](/wiki/Catwoman \"Catwoman\"): Her Many Lives, aired on July\n20, 2004, it was stated that Newmar was unable to reprise her role due to a\nreported back injury. [Catwoman](/wiki/Catwoman \"Catwoman\") was nonetheless\nplayed by Newmar once again in the following eleven episodes of [season\ntwo](/wiki/List_of_Batman_television_episodes#Season_2:_1966–67 \"List of\nBatman television episodes\") of the series; [Eartha Kitt](/wiki/Eartha_Kitt\n\"Eartha Kitt\") would then play [Catwoman](/wiki/Catwoman \"Catwoman\") in three\nepisodes of [season\nthree](/wiki/List_of_Batman_television_episodes#Season_3:_1967–68 \"List of\nBatman television episodes\").\n\nIn his autobiography, [Adam West](/wiki/Adam_West \"Adam West\") writes of his\nasking for more money to do the film and that the producers countered with the\nfact that another actor would be hired. _Batman_ was Denny's final film\nappearance. [Jack LaLanne](/wiki/Jack_LaLanne \"Jack LaLanne\") has a cameo as a\nman on a rooftop with bikini-clad women.[6]\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batman_\\(1966_film\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n[William Dozier](/wiki/William_Dozier \"William Dozier\") wanted to make a big-\nscreen film to generate interest in his proposed [Batman](/wiki/Batman\n\"Batman\") TV series by having the feature in theaters while the first season\nof the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, [20th Century\nFox](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox \"20th Century Fox\"), refused because it would have\nto cover the entire cost of a movie, while it would only have to share the\ncost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).[7]\n\nThe film features many characters from the show. It was written by series\nwriter [Lorenzo Semple, Jr.](/wiki/Lorenzo_Semple,_Jr. \"Lorenzo Semple, Jr.\")\nand directed by [Leslie H. Martinson](/wiki/Leslie_H._Martinson \"Leslie H.\nMartinson\").[8] Martinson had directed a pair of the television series season\none episodes: \"The Penguin Goes Straight\" and \"Not Yet, He Ain't\".\n\n### Tone[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batman_\\(1966_film\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Tone\")]\n\nEven though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody\nof a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy\nis not so tightly confined. They felt the film's depiction of the Caped\nCrusader \"captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly\".[9] The film\nwas, they remind us, made at a time when \"the Batman of the [Golden Age\ncomics](/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Comic_Books \"Golden Age of Comic Books\") was\nalready essentially neutered.\"[10]\n\nCertain elements verge into direct parody of the history of Batman. The movie,\nlike the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s\nserials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck.[10] The\npenchant for giving devices a \"Bat-\" prefix and the dramatic use of stylized\ntitle cards during fight scenes acknowledge some of the conventions that the\ncharacter had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of _Batman_\n's campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s\nculture in general.[11]\n\nFurthermore, the movie represented Batman's first major foray into [Cold\nWar](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\") issues paying heavy attention to [Polaris\nMissiles](/wiki/UGM-27_Polaris \"UGM-27 Polaris\"), [war surplus\nsubmarines](/wiki/War_surplus \"War surplus\") and taking a poke at [the\nPentagon](/wiki/The_Pentagon \"The Pentagon\"). The inclusion of a glory-hunting\npresidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of Security Council\nMembers marked Batman's first attempts to poke fun at domestic and\ninternational politics.[12]\n\n###\nVehicles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Batman_\\(1966_film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Vehicles\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/1960s_Batmobile_%28FMC%29.jpg/220px-1960s_Batmobile_%28FMC%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:1960s_Batmobile_\\(FMC\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1960s_Batmobile_\\(FMC\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Batmobile as seen in the 1960s _Batman_ TV series.\n\nBesides the [Batmobile](/wiki/Batmobile \"Batmobile\"), other vehicles used by\nThe Dynamic Duo include:\n\n  * [Batcycle](/wiki/Batcycle \"Batcycle\") with side car\n  * [Batboat](/wiki/Batboat \"Batboat\"), provided by [Glastron](/wiki/Glastron \"Glastron\")\n  * [Batcopter](/wiki/Batcopter \"Batcopter\")\n\nOf the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the _Batman_ film, only\nthe [Batcycle](/wiki/Batcycle \"Batcycle\") properly crossed over into the [TV\nseries](/wiki/Batman_\\(TV_series\\) \"Batman \\(TV series\\)\") as the budgetary\nlimits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others.
