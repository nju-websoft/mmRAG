In spite of Shripad Rao's self-\nnomination as the _Peshwa_ , Ambaji Pant nominates a young\n[Bajirao](/wiki/Bajirao_I \"Bajirao I\"). To test his spiritual wisdom and\nknowledge of weaponry, Shripad challenges Bajirao to split a peacock feather\nwith an arrow. Bajirao succeeds and is given the title of _Peshwa_. Ten years\nlater, his wife [Kashibai](/wiki/Kashibai \"Kashibai\") is visited by her\nwidowed friend Bhanu, whose husband was accused of spying and was ordered to\nbe executed by Bajirao. She predicts that just as she longs for her husband,\nKashibai will yearn for Bajirao.\n\nWhile travelling to [Sironja](/wiki/Sironj \"Sironj\"), an emissary from\n[Bundelkhand](/wiki/Bundelkhand \"Bundelkhand\") enters Bajirao's tent and\nrequests his help to fight invaders. She reveals herself to be\n[Mastani](/wiki/Mastani \"Mastani\"), the daughter of the Hindu\n[Rajput](/wiki/Rajput \"Rajput\") king [Chhatrasal](/wiki/Chhatrasal\n\"Chhatrasal\") and his [Persian](/wiki/Persian_people \"Persian people\") Muslim\nconsort Ruhani Bai. Impressed by her skills as a warrior, Bajirao assists her\nwith his army and defeats the invaders. Chhatrasal is overjoyed and insists\nBajirao spend [Holi](/wiki/Holi \"Holi\") with them in Bundelkhand. Mastani and\nBajirao fall in love with each other and he gives her his dagger, unaware it\nis a symbol of marriage among the Bundelkhand Rajputs. Bajirao departs for\n[Pune](/wiki/Pune \"Pune\"), where Kashibai greets him with a tour of their\nnewly-built [Shaniwar Wada](/wiki/Shaniwar_Wada \"Shaniwar Wada\") and shows him\nthe [Aaina Mahal](/wiki/Aina_Mahal \"Aina Mahal\") (hall of mirrors), which\nallows her to see him from her room.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Peshwa_Baji_Rao_I_riding_horse.jpg/153px-\nPeshwa_Baji_Rao_I_riding_horse.jpg)](/wiki/File:Peshwa_Baji_Rao_I_riding_horse.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Mastani_28tt13.jpg/150px-\nMastani_28tt13.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mastani_28tt13.jpg)\n\nA painting of Baji Rao I _(left)_ and Mastani _(right)_\n\nDetermined to pursue her love, Mastani arrives in Pune but is treated harshly\nby Bajirao's mother Radhabai and accommodated in the palace for\n[courtesans](/wiki/Courtesan \"Courtesan\"). Mastani tolerates this insult and\nappears to dance before Bajirao. Radhabai scornfully offers her the occupation\nof a royal dancer but refuses to accept her as a daughter-in-law. Mastani\ntravels to the Chhatrapati Shahu and expresses her desire to be with Bajirao,\nthen leaves to wait for him at a ruin across a river. During a storm, Bajirao\ncrosses the river and chides Mastani's persistence, reminding her he is\nalready married and that his court will never respect her if she is in a\nrelationship with him. She agrees, despite his warning, and he declares\nMastani his second wife.\n\nThe Marathas prepare to attack [Delhi](/wiki/Delhi \"Delhi\"), the capital of\nthe [Mughal Empire](/wiki/Mughal_Empire \"Mughal Empire\"), but must first\nensure the [Nizam of Hyderabad](/wiki/Nizam_of_Hyderabad \"Nizam of\nHyderabad\"), the Muslim ruler of [Hyderabad State](/wiki/Hyderabad_State\n\"Hyderabad State\"), will not attack them during their assault. Bajirao leaves\nto confront the Nizam, [Qamar ud-Din Khan](/wiki/Qamar-ud-din_Khan,_Asif_Jah_I\n\"Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I\"), and returns successful. In the Aaina Mahal,\nKashibai, who is pregnant, sees Bajirao embracing Mastani, who is also\nexpecting, and leaves for her mother's home. She returns to joyous\ncelebrations months later with her newborn son, who is named\n[Raghunath](/wiki/Raghunathrao \"Raghunathrao\"). Mastani also gives birth to a\nson, whom Mastani and Bajirao name Krishna Rao. After the head\n[Brahmin](/wiki/Brahmin \"Brahmin\") priest Krishna Bhatt refuses to conduct the\n_naamkaran_ (the Hindu naming ceremony) on the grounds that Krishna Rao is\nillegitimate, Bajirao renames his son [Shamsher\nBahadur](/wiki/Shamsher_Bahadur \"Shamsher Bahadur\"). A few years later,\nKashibai and Bajirao's eldest son [Balaji Baji Rao](/wiki/Balaji_Baji_Rao\n\"Balaji Baji Rao\"), also known as Nana Saheb, returns from\n[Satara](/wiki/Satara_\\(city\\) \"Satara \\(city\\)\") and expresses his hatred of\nMastani for disrupting his mother's marriage.\n\nShiva Bhatt, a Brahmin priest, informs Kashibai of a plan to murder Mastani\nand her son during a festival. Kashibai relays this news to Bajirao, who\nrescues both of them. Krishna Bhatt kills Shiva Bhatt, enraging Bajirao. To\nkeep Mastani's safe and to grant her a royal home, Bajirao builds the Mastani\nMahal for her. Bajirao, however, is heartbroken due to the betrayal of his\nmother Radhabai and his brother [Chimaji Appa](/wiki/Chimaji_Appa \"Chimaji\nAppa\"). Meanwhile, Pant tells Bajirao he must defeat [Nasir\nJung](/wiki/Nasir_Jung \"Nasir Jung\"), the vengeful son of the Nizam. Bajirao\nsays that although he loves Mastani, his life and allegiance is always to his\ncause and he leaves for the battlefield. Before leaving, he meets Kashibai in\ndeference to a tradition that the wife sent her husband off into battle.\nKashibai tells Bajirao he has broken her heart and compares their love with\nthat of [Krishna](/wiki/Krishna \"Krishna\") and [Rukmini](/wiki/Rukmini\n\"Rukmini\"). Kashibai orders him never to enter her chamber again, and Bajirao\naccepts and leaves.\n\nAfter Bajirao leaves for battle, Radhabai and Nana Saheb imprison Mastani and\nShamsher Bahadur. After Bajirao receives the news, he single-handedly defeats\nNasir Jung's army in his rage but collapses from his injuries. At his\ndeathbed, Kashibai sends a letter pleading with Radhabai to release Mastani so\nBajirao can recover, but Nana Saheb burns the letter and refuses to release\nMastani. Bajirao, delirious due to his sickness, dies from the trauma of his\nhallucinations; at the same time Mastani dies in captivity. The ill-fated\nlovers are shown to be united in death.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bajirao_Mastani&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Cast\")]\n\nThe cast is listed below:[3]\n\n  * [Ranveer Singh](/wiki/Ranveer_Singh \"Ranveer Singh\") as [Bajirao I](/wiki/Bajirao_I \"Bajirao I\")\n  * [Deepika Padukone](/wiki/Deepika_Padukone \"Deepika Padukone\") as [Mastani](/wiki/Mastani \"Mastani\")\n  * [Priyanka Chopra](/wiki/Priyanka_Chopra \"Priyanka Chopra\") as [Kashibai](/wiki/Kashibai \"Kashibai\")\n  * [Tanvi Azmi](/wiki/Tanvi_Azmi \"Tanvi Azmi\") as Radhabai\n  * [Milind Soman](/wiki/Milind_Soman \"Milind Soman\") as Ambaji Pant\n  * [Vaibhav Tatwawaadi](/wiki/Vaibhav_Tatwawaadi \"Vaibhav Tatwawaadi\") as [Chimaji Appa](/wiki/Chimaji_Appa \"Chimaji Appa\")\n  * [Ayush Tandon](/wiki/Ayush_Tandon \"Ayush Tandon\") as [Nana Saheb](/wiki/Balaji_Baji_Rao \"Balaji Baji Rao\")\n  * Rudra Soni as Young Nana Saheb\n  * [Mahesh Manjrekar](/wiki/Mahesh_Manjrekar \"Mahesh Manjrekar\") as [Chhatrapati Shahu](/wiki/Chhatrapati_Shahu \"Chhatrapati Shahu\")\n  * [Aditya Pancholi](/wiki/Aditya_Pancholi \"Aditya Pancholi\") as Shripad Rao\n  * [Raza Murad](/wiki/Raza_Murad \"Raza Murad\") as [Qamar ud-Din Khan](/wiki/Qamar-ud-din_Khan,_Asif_Jah_I \"Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I\")\n  * Sukhada Khandkekar as Anubai\n  * [Benjamin Gilani](/wiki/Benjamin_Gilani \"Benjamin Gilani\") as King [Chhatrasal](/wiki/Chhatrasal \"Chhatrasal\")\n  * [Anuja Sathe](/wiki/Anuja_Sathe \"Anuja Sathe\") as Bhiubai\n  * [Yatin Karyekar](/wiki/Yatin_Karyekar \"Yatin Karyekar\") as Krishna Bhatt\n  * Ganesh Yadav as Malhar Rao\n  * Snehlata Girish Vasaikar as Bhanu\n  * [Mousumi Saha](/wiki/Mousumi_Saha \"Mousumi Saha\") as Bhavana Rao\n  * [Irrfan Khan](/wiki/Irrfan_Khan \"Irrfan Khan\") as the narrator ([voice-over](/wiki/Voice-over \"Voice-over\"))\n\n## Production[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bajirao_Mastani&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bajirao_Mastani&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n[![A photograph of Sanjay Leela Bhansali looking towards the\ncamera](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Sanjay_Leela_Bhansali2.jpg/220px-\nSanjay_Leela_Bhansali2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sanjay_Leela_Bhansali2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sanjay_Leela_Bhansali2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Sanjay Leela Bhansali](/wiki/Sanjay_Leela_Bhansali \"Sanjay Leela Bhansali\")\n(_pictured in 2011_) had been longing to make the film for over a decade.\n\n[Sanjay Leela Bhansali](/wiki/Sanjay_Leela_Bhansali \"Sanjay Leela Bhansali\")\nhad conceived the historical romance about Maratha Peshwa\n[Bajirao](/wiki/Baji_Rao_I \"Baji Rao I\") and his second wife Mastani even\nbefore he had directed his first feature _[Khamoshi: The\nMusical](/wiki/Khamoshi:_The_Musical \"Khamoshi: The Musical\")_ in 1996.[4]\nSeveral other directors such as [Muzaffar Ali](/wiki/Muzaffar_Ali \"Muzaffar\nAli\"), [Manmohan Desai](/wiki/Manmohan_Desai \"Manmohan Desai\") and [Kamal\nAmrohi](/wiki/Kamal_Amrohi \"Kamal Amrohi\") had tried to make a film about the\ntwo historical figures but they were never made.[5] Bhansali had intended to\nmake _Bajirao Mastani_ after the release of\n_[Devdas](/wiki/Devdas_\\(2002_Hindi_film\\) \"Devdas \\(2002 Hindi film\\)\")_\n(2002) and had officially announced it in 2003, with filming scheduled to\nbegin in May 2004.[6] The film, however, was shelved indefinitely. Reports\nabout a possible revival had made headlines ever since; Bhansali had planned\nto revive it every other year but the project never came to fruition.[7] In an\ninterview with _[The Telegraph](/wiki/The_Telegraph_\\(Calcutta\\) \"The\nTelegraph \\(Calcutta\\)\")_ , Bhansali spoke about his intention to make\n_Bajirao Mastani_ after finishing every film he made in-between, saying \"I\nkept trying to revive it over and over again, but if there is one thing that\nfilmmaking has taught me, it's that every film has its own destiny. And I\nstrongly believe that the souls of ... Bajirao, Mastani and Kashibai wanted us\nto make this film only now.\"[5] In the process, the film became a passion\nproject for him.[5]\n\nAfter spending eleven years in [development hell](/wiki/Development_hell\n\"Development hell\"), Bhansali revived the project in 2014; the film was\nreported to be an adaptation of the Marathi-language novel _Raau_ (1976) by\n[Nagnath S. Inamdar](/wiki/Nagnath_S._Inamdar \"Nagnath S. Inamdar\").[4] After\nthe project was shelved, Bhansali said he struggled to put the film together\nand that he considered the project impossible to made. Nevertheless, he clung\nto his ambition to make the film someday, saying, \"there is magic to it\".[5]\nSome film industry professionals believed it would never be made, calling it\n\"jinxed\".[8] Bhansali always believed in the project, assuring himself the\nscript was so powerful he had to make it one day.[8] He told _The Telegraph_ ,\n\"Honestly, I want very few things in life ... so I know that I am resilient\nenough to get them all! Deep down, I kept asking for the universe to let me\nmake this film. When you dream very genuinely, then I believe you also get the\npower to fulfill it. In pursuing _Bajirao Mastani_ , I have been resilient and\nvery focused. I have sacrificed a lot of things\".[5]\n\nPrimarily known for making romantic dramas, Bhansali was intrigued about the\nromance between \"two people who defied everything, just to be in love with\neach other\", and was excited to tell a 200-year-old story.[5] He wanted to\nshow the relationship between Bajirao and Mastani because it was rarely\ndepicted in history books, and little was known about it.[5] He had long\nadmired the Maratha backdrop and the different religions of the\nprotagonists—Bajirao was Hindu and Mastani was Muslim—which further drove his\ninterest towards knowing more and telling the story.[5] He saw it as a chance\nto comment on religion and love, saying, \"In those times, people were offended\nby the same things that offend them today. Through this film, I want to show\nthat love is the greatest religion.\"[5]\n\nPrakash R. Kapadia wrote the screenplay.[9] The makers acquired the rights of\nthe novel and worked with historian [Ninad Bedekar](/wiki/Ninad_Bedekar \"Ninad\nBedekar\"). Kapadia said writing the screenplay was a difficult task and a huge\nresponsibility considering the historical context.[9] Kapadia and Bhansali had\nconsistently worked on the script since its conception, refining several\naspects of the film.[9] Considering the script was written twelve years\nbefore, several changes were made to it, such as the decreasing the length and\nincreasing the pace to suit the modern audiences.[9] Although adapted from the\nnovel, the romance between the film's protagonists has not been well\ndocumented in history books or archives and several versions of the story\nexist. Many cinematic liberties were taken to build drama and highlight\nincidents.[5]\n\n### Casting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bajirao_Mastani&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\nBhansali originally wanted to repeat his _[Hum Dil De Chuke\nSanam](/wiki/Hum_Dil_De_Chuke_Sanam \"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam\")_ (1999) pairing\nof [Salman Khan](/wiki/Salman_Khan \"Salman Khan\") with [Aishwarya\nRai](/wiki/Aishwarya_Rai \"Aishwarya Rai\") for the eponymous roles, but could\nnot cast them together after their highly publicised break-up.[10] Khan then\ntried to suggest his then-girlfriend [Katrina Kaif](/wiki/Katrina_Kaif\n\"Katrina Kaif\") for the role of Mastani but things did not materialise.[11]\nWhen the film was finally announced in 2003, Bhansali had cast Khan and\n[Kareena Kapoor](/wiki/Kareena_Kapoor \"Kareena Kapoor\") in the titular roles,\nwith [Rani Mukerji](/wiki/Rani_Mukerji \"Rani Mukerji\") playing Baji Rao's\nfirst wife Kashibai.[6] However, the idea was scrapped when Khan and Kapoor\nsigned other films together.

My picture would be there and the pictures for Bajirao and\nMastani would keep changing.\"[18][20]\n\n[Milind Soman](/wiki/Milind_Soman \"Milind Soman\") joined the cast in the late\nAugust 2014.[21] In late September 2014, it was confirmed that [Tanvi\nAzmi](/wiki/Tanvi_Azmi \"Tanvi Azmi\") was cast for the role of Bajirao's mother\nRadhabai; [Shabana Azmi](/wiki/Shabana_Azmi \"Shabana Azmi\"), [Dimple\nKapadia](/wiki/Dimple_Kapadia \"Dimple Kapadia\"), and [Supriya\nPathak](/wiki/Supriya_Pathak \"Supriya Pathak\") had also been considered for\nthe role.[22] The following month, [Aditya Pancholi](/wiki/Aditya_Pancholi\n\"Aditya Pancholi\") joined the cast as an antagonist.[23] In November 2014, the\ncasting of Bajirao's sisters were finalised; Sukhada Khandkekar was ast as\nAnubai and [Anuja Gokhale](/wiki/Anuja_Gokhale \"Anuja Gokhale\") as\nBhiubai.[24] The following month, [Mahesh Manjrekar](/wiki/Mahesh_Manjrekar\n\"Mahesh Manjrekar\") was cast to play Maratha Emperor Chhattrapati Shahu.[25]\nIt was announced in January 2015 that [Vaibhav\nTatwawaadi](/wiki/Vaibhav_Tatwawaadi \"Vaibhav Tatwawaadi\") was chosen to play\nBajirao's younger brother Chimaji Appa.[26] [Irrfan Khan](/wiki/Irrfan_Khan\n\"Irrfan Khan\") was cast as the film's narrator.[3]\n\nAll of the actors had to undergo training before filming began; Singh and\nPadukone learned sword-fighting, horse-riding and the ancient Indian martial\nart [Kalaripayattu](/wiki/Kalaripayattu \"Kalaripayattu\").[27][28] Singh was\nalso required to learn Marathi and shave his head for the part, whereas\nPadukone had to take [Kathak](/wiki/Kathak \"Kathak\") dance lessons.[27][29] In\npreparation for her role of Kashibai, Chopra had 15 days of language training\nin the Peshwai Marathi dialect spoken during the time of the ascension of the\nPeshwas to perfect the accent.[30] Azmi shaved her head completely for her\nrole.[31]\n\nSingh has described his character as a \"true Maratha\", saying, \"The deeper I\nget into it the more I realise what a great man he was. It is a great honour\nto be selected to play this character.\"[32] He has said he always wanted to\ntransform himself into a character and playing Bajirao gave him that scope,\nwhich he said was \"draining and tiring in every way\".[33] For portraying\nBajirao, Singh's preparations required him to isolate himself from his own\nbeing and living like Bajirao. He instructed the crew members to address him\nas Bajirao, which helped him to remain in his character.[33] Singh would not\nrespond to people who used his real name. He said, \"It takes a lot of work and\neffort to be different from whom I am, and two hours to get ready, complete\nwith makeup and the heavy costumes. After all this, if someone just tells me,\nRanveer, your shot is ready! all that goes to waste.\"[33] Padukone found her\ncharacter to be very relatable, saying, \"She was so brave, strong, determined\nand yet fragile and vulnerable\".[34] She was also inspired by her character\nand found playing the role challenging; it was physically demanding and\nrequired a lot of dancing.[34] Padukone said the character had different\nlayers; \"One minute she goes on the battlefield, the next minute she's\nromancing him\".[34] Chopra was drawn towards the film because of her character\nwhich she thought was \"very heart-breaking\".[18] She said playing Kashibai was\n\"emotionally difficult\" and a complete contrast to the strong women she has\nportrayed in most of her films.[35] She described her character as someone who\nis \"heartbroken, a silent sufferer, dignified, resilient, can't take charge of\nher life, goes with whatever life throws her way. Just grace under fire.\"[35]\n\n### Pre-\nproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bajirao_Mastani&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Pre-production\")]\n\nConsidering its scale, the film required detailed and extravagant pre-\nproduction work, which required extensive research and planning. Saloni\nDhatrak, Sriram Iyengar and Sujeet Sawant worked as [production\ndesigners](/wiki/Production_designer \"Production designer\") on the film.[36]\nIyengar and Sawant had heard about the film while working on another film,\nwhen it was first announced. Having never met Bhansali, they started\nresearching on their own by visiting Pune and [Satara](/wiki/Satara_\\(city\\)\n\"Satara \\(city\\)\") and learnt about Maratha architecture.[36] When the film\nwas shelved, they continued to research and formed a portfolio, hoping to\napproach other filmmakers for work. Several years later, when they heard about\nthe revival, they met Bhansali, who was impresses by their research and\npresentation.[36][37] Bhansali wanted more research on [Mughals](/wiki/Mughals\n\"Mughals\"); he engaged Dhatrak, who joined Iyengar and Sawant.[36] Bhansali\nthen shared the script with the art directors and described his vision and the\nscale of the production.[38] Pre-production work started as early as February\n2014, continued as the shoot progressed and lasted until the filming was\ncomplete in October 2015; it lasted nineteen months.[37] Before pre-production\nwork started, the art directors discussed with Bhansali about how much of the\nfilm would be filmed on set and outdoor locations, giving them an idea to how\nmany sets they needed to create. Once the number of sets and location shots\nwas decided, the production moved forward.[38]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Shaniwarwada_gate.JPG/300px-\nShaniwarwada_gate.JPG)](/wiki/File:Shaniwarwada_gate.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Shaniwarwada_gate.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe set for [Shaniwar Wada](/wiki/Shaniwar_Wada \"Shaniwar Wada\") was the\nbiggest set created for the film.\n\nAlong with the art directors, nineteen art assistant directors, including\narchitects, designers, sketch artists and props artists, were involved.[37]\nTwenty-two sets were created in [Film City](/wiki/Film_City \"Film City\")\nfollowing a flow chart that included around 960 sketches and countless\nlayouts. The two biggest sets were the exact replicas of [Shaniwar\nWada](/wiki/Shaniwar_Wada \"Shaniwar Wada\") and the Aaina Mahal, both of which\nwere \"high on grandeur and intricacy\".[37] The Shaniwar Wada set was the\nbiggest set they had constructed; it took 45,000 planks and 600 workers a day\nto erect.[36] It was constructed on Sunil Maidan, one of the biggest open\nspaces in Film City and took forty-five days to build.[37] Kashibai's room was\nthe first set to be constructed, which was approved after navigating through\ntwenty-five designs.[37] The art directors did architectural research from\nPune, [Nasik](/wiki/Nasik \"Nasik\") and Satara, studying fortifications, baston\nwalls and city gates to understand the interior and exterior designs of the\nancient period and incorporated those ideas into building Kashibai's villa.\nLotus motifs on mud-clad walls and handmade textures were used to give the set\na realistic appearance.[37]\n\nAina Mahal took 4,500 planks, with a hundred workers per day. The set was\ngiven a lotus-like design, with walls, ceiling and floor made out of handmade\nmud embedded with sparkling mirror designs.[37][39] The replica of Aina Mahal\nwas constructed in forty days, with more than 30,000 square feet of mirrors.\nMore than 700 design stencils were used to decorate the hall.[39] Although the\nmirror hall was a Mughal concept, the art directors designed it to look like\nMaratha architecture. Mastani Mahal was built as an amalgamation of Rajput and\nMaratha architecture.[37] The exterior of Mastani Mahal was built as a part of\nShaniwar Wada, whereas the interiors of were built on separate sets consisting\nof a courtyard and bedroom. Mastani's room in Bundelkhand was crafted using a\nmix of Persian, Mughal and Rajput motifs and architecture.[37]\n\nAll of the sets were furnished with opulent objects and props to give the\ninteriors a feel of the ancient [Maratha empire](/wiki/Maratha_empire \"Maratha\nempire\"). Only earthen diyas and torches were used to light the sets.[37]\nSilken saris were used, with bedsheets and hand-painted walls with 18th\ncentury motifs added.[39] Craftsmen were hired to recreate 18th-century\ntextures, fabrics, weaponry, jewellery and furniture. Almost 30,000 oil lamps\nwere made for the film and 500 suits of armour were designed for the war\nscenes.[39] There were also headgear and boots worn in that period. The armour\nand headgear weighed between ten-twenty kilos and two kilos, respectively.[39]\nThe team also designed props including different types of tents, lighting\nprops, and elephant and horse decors for the war sequences. The props were\nmade in Mumbai and had to be taken to Rajasthan, the outdoor location.[37]\n\n### Costumes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bajirao_Mastani&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Costumes\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Ravi_Varma-\nPrincess_Damayanthi_talking_with_Royal_Swan_about_Nala.jpg/200px-Ravi_Varma-\nPrincess_Damayanthi_talking_with_Royal_Swan_about_Nala.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ravi_Varma-\nPrincess_Damayanthi_talking_with_Royal_Swan_about_Nala.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ravi_Varma-\nPrincess_Damayanthi_talking_with_Royal_Swan_about_Nala.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe paintings of [Raja Ravi Varma](/wiki/Raja_Ravi_Varma \"Raja Ravi Varma\")\nwas used as an inspiration for creating Kashibai's look\n\nThe film's costumes were designed by Anju Modi and Maxima Basu.[40] Modi\ndesigned clothes for the three lead characters and Basu designed for the\nsupporting cast. The costumes for extras and war extras were done by Ajay and\nChandrakant, respectively.[40] Bhansali had detailed script-reading sessions\nwith the designers to help them understand the characters, their emotions and\npersonalities, which would mirror the costumes and the grandeur of the 18th\ncentury.[41] Basu started her research by visiting several ancient monuments\nsuch as the [Chowmahalla Palace](/wiki/Chowmahalla_Palace \"Chowmahalla\nPalace\"), [Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu\nSangrahalaya](/wiki/Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Maharaj_Vastu_Sangrahalaya\n\"Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya\"), [Salar Jung\nMuseum](/wiki/Salar_Jung_Museum \"Salar Jung Museum\") and\n[Ajanta](/wiki/Ajanta_Caves \"Ajanta Caves\")-[Ellora](/wiki/Ellora_Caves\n\"Ellora Caves\") caves, which gave her some perspective of ancient Maharastrian\nculture.[41] She also travelled to cities such as [Indore](/wiki/Indore\n\"Indore\"), [Chanderi](/wiki/Chanderi \"Chanderi\"), [Paithan](/wiki/Paithan\n\"Paithan\") and [Maheshwar](/wiki/Maheshwar \"Maheshwar\") to gather more\nknowledge about the history of clothing and textiles.[42]\n\nAbout 300 costumes were designed for the three leads alone.[39] Real\n[zari](/wiki/Zari \"Zari\") and [goldwires](/wiki/Goldwire \"Goldwire\") were used\nto weave the costumes.[41] Since no pictures of Kashibai existed, the\npaintings of [Raja Ravi Varma](/wiki/Raja_Ravi_Varma \"Raja Ravi Varma\") were\nused as a reference for designing her looks and costumes.[39] Modi had\ndesigned eighty [nauvari or nine-yard saris](/wiki/Kasta_sari \"Kasta sari\")\nwith bright colours such as yellows, hot pink, emerald green and purple,\ninspired from the Raja Ravi Varma paintings, for Chopra.[42] The custom-made\nnine-yard saris were weaved by craftsmen from [Maheshwar](/wiki/Maheshwar\n\"Maheshwar\"), [Chander](/wiki/Chander \"Chander\") and [Varanasi](/wiki/Varanasi\n\"Varanasi\"); they were made a little lighter than usual to avoid making Chopra\nPriyanka look large on screen.[43][44] For making the saris, fabrics such as\n[Mul-Mul](/wiki/Mul-Mul \"Mul-Mul\"), silk, muslin, [khadi](/wiki/Khadi \"Khadi\")\nand [chanderis](/wiki/Chanderi \"Chanderi\") worn in that period were\ndesigned.[39][42] For one song sequence featuring Chopra, Modi had created six\nsets of the same sari.[43]\n\nPeshwas used to wear _[Dhotis](/wiki/Dhoti \"Dhoti\")_ ,\n_[Jamas](/wiki/Jama_\\(coat\\) \"Jama \\(coat\\)\")_ and _[Angarkhas](/wiki/Angarkha\n\"Angarkha\")_ with a large flare in that period, so it was eminent for\nBajirao's character.[41][43] A wide palette of solid colours, such as white\nand cream, were used for the sombre and emotional scenes whereas red, orange,\nblue and deep purple were used for the celebratory scenes.[44] For designing\nthe Bajirao's armour, [chain mail](/wiki/Chain_Mail_Armor \"Chain Mail Armor\"),\nkhaki and [steel grey](/wiki/Steel_grey \"Steel grey\") were employed.[44] A\n[dandpatta](/wiki/Pata_\\(sword\\) \"Pata \\(sword\\)\") sword was also made for\nhim.[39] For Mastani, Modi used a mix of Persian and Muslim clothing of\nmuslin, khadi and thin Chanderi fabrics, with mukaish and\n[zardosi](/wiki/Zardozi \"Zardozi\") hand embroidery to depict her half-Muslim\nheritage.[41][42] Padukone was predominantly given [shararas](/wiki/Sharara\n\"Sharara\") and its derivatives such trailing shararas, shararas with less\nflare and crinkled shararas made of [chiffon](/wiki/Chiffon_\\(fabric\\)\n\"Chiffon \\(fabric\\)\"). She was given a [lehenga](/wiki/Lehenga \"Lehenga\") for\njust one scene.[41] She was also given Odhnis, [dupattas](/wiki/Dupatta\n\"Dupatta\"), [veils](/wiki/Veil \"Veil\"), floor-skimming\n[anarkalis](/wiki/Anarkali_Salwar_Suit \"Anarkali Salwar Suit\") and angrakhas\npaired with [Farshi pajamas](/wiki/Farshi_Pajama \"Farshi Pajama\").[45][43]\nSofter colours with Persian influences such as shades of powder blue, mint\ngreen, pale yellow, aqua blue, powder pink and other typical porcelain colours\nwere used for her clothes.[42][44] A [turban](/wiki/Turban \"Turban\")\nembellished with jewellery such as uncut diamonds and pearls was designed.[41]\nFor one of the Mastani costumes, Modu designed a five-layered outfit\nconsisting of an angrakha jacket, a woven [leheria](/wiki/Leheria \"Leheria\")\ndupatta, sharara and inner [kurti](/wiki/Kurta \"Kurta\").[45]\n\nExpensive and real jewellery was used in the film.[42] The designers created\nthe jewellery for each character.[45] Modi said they did not want to\ncompromise, so the best materials such as real Basra [pearls](/wiki/Pearls\n\"Pearls\"), antique stones and [uncut diamonds](/wiki/Uncut_diamond \"Uncut\ndiamond\") were used to give the royal look needed for the characters.[45]\nTraditional Marathi-style jewellery was used to style Kashibai, while for\nMastani [Nizami](/wiki/Nizam_\\(title\\) \"Nizam \\(title\\)\") and\n[polki](/wiki/Polki \"Polki\") Jewellery was used.[42] Several Indian jewellery\ndesigners, including PN Gadgil from Pune and Shri Hari Jewellers from Delhi,\nwere hired.[45] The costume and production designers also researched in\nmuseums, art galleries, history books, paintings, palaces, temples and forts\nto study the textiles, colour palettes and artwork of the ancient Maratha\nEmpire.[39][42]\n\n### Principal\nphotography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bajirao_Mastani&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Principal photography\")]\n\nCinematographer [Sudeep Chatterjee](/wiki/Sudeep_Chatterjee \"Sudeep\nChatterjee\") shot the film using [Arri Alexa XT](/wiki/Arri_Alexa \"Arri\nAlexa\") lenses.[46] Chatterjee had done extensive research before starting the\nfilm.[46] [Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal\nphotography\") began on 9 October 2014 with Chopra on the set in Film City,\n[Mumbai](/wiki/Mumbai \"Mumbai\").[47][48][49][50] Later that month, Singh\njoined the shoot.[51] Most of the film was shot on the highly detailed\nsets.[50] In late November, Chopra fainted on the set due to exhaustion while\nfilming a scene that needed to be filmed ten times continuously. A doctor was\ncalled and filming stopped for some time but she later resumed the shoot.[52]\nPadukone joined the cast for two days during in late December 2014 and resumed\nshooting in April 2015 after completing work for her other projects.[53][54]\n\nOutdoor location filming began in February 2015 at [Amer Fort](/wiki/Amer_Fort\n\"Amer Fort\") in [Jaipur](/wiki/Jaipur \"Jaipur\").[55] Crowd scenes were also\nfilmed there.[56] Singh fell off a horse while filming an action sequence and\nwas rushed to hospital; he was not seriously injured.[57] In May 2015,\nhowever, he injured his shoulder and needed surgery; he resumed shooting after\nbreak of two months.[58]\n\n[![A photograph of Amer\nFort](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Amber_Fort_%28%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE_%29.jpg/300px-\nAmber_Fort_%28%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE_%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Amber_Fort_\\(%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE_\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Amber_Fort_\\(%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE_\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nSome of the outdoor scenes were filmed at the [Amer Fort](/wiki/Amer_Fort\n\"Amer Fort\")\n\nChopra resumed filming in the first week of April 2015 for a month.[59] While\nworking on _Bajirao Mastani_ , Chopra was simultaneously filming the American\ntelevision series _[Quantico](/wiki/Quantico_\\(TV_series\\) \"Quantico \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ in [Montreal](/wiki/Montreal \"Montreal\"), requiring much back-and\nforth travel.[60] She would act for _Bajirao Mastani_ at weekends and return\nto Montreal on weekdays for her series, returning to India in the second week\nof October to complete the final schedule.[61]\n\nBefore starting the film, the team discussed which parts of it had to be\nfilmed and which parts needed to be made using visual effects.[46] They\ndecided that only sequences that were considered difficult or impossible to\nfilm would be created using visual effects in post production.[46] In one\nsequence, it was impossible to control the movements of the 300–400 horses\nstanding at one position in a battle scene; this sequence was filmed with a\nsmall number of horses and was later enhanced in post production.[46][62]\n\nSham Kaushal co-ordinated the action sequences for the war scenes.[39] Three\nwar sequences were filmed in [Rajasthan](/wiki/Rajasthan \"Rajasthan\"), [Madhya\nPradesh](/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh \"Madhya Pradesh\") and\n[Maharashtra](/wiki/Maharashtra \"Maharashtra\"). Chatterjee found the war\nsequences challenging and faced many difficulties while filming in the deserts\nof Rajasthan. Wanting to break with norms, Bhansali wanted a night-time war\nsequence; lighting a large, open field became very difficult and visibility\nissues were inevitable. Bhansali wanted very clear images. Instead, they\ndecided to shoot these scenes in the morning, aiming for a twilight look.[46]\nThe main war scene featuring 800 extras, 500 horses and twenty-five elephants\nwas filmed over twenty days near Jaipur.[39] The extras would begin costuming,\nwhich included beards for the Mughals, moustaches for the Marathas, armours,\nhelmets and uniforms, at 04:00 for the start of filming at 08:00.[39] After\nfinishing the shoot, the costumes would be washed in readiness for 04:00 the\nfollowing day. Kaushal has said extensive research was done before filming the\nwar sequences, and a rough graph was designed nine months before the\nfilming.[39] However, the entire sequence could not be filmed in one take on\nlocation and was completed later in a studio in Film City, and was enhanced in\npost production.[38]\n\n[Ganesh Acharya](/wiki/Ganesh_Acharya \"Ganesh Acharya\"), [Remo\nD'Souza](/wiki/Remo_D%27Souza \"Remo D'Souza\"), [Pony Verma](/wiki/Pony_Verma\n\"Pony Verma\"), Shampa Gopikrishna and [Pandit Birju\nMaharaj](/wiki/Pandit_Birju_Maharaj \"Pandit Birju Maharaj\") were the\nchoreographers for the film's song sequences.[3] Bhansali chose D'Souza, who\nhad only choreographed modern dance numbers at that time, to choreograph the\nsong \"Pinga\", which took weeks to complete. Chopra and Padukone had to\nrehearse for several days before shooting.[63] The filming was challenging for\nChopra and Padukone; they had to shoot for the dance sequences multiple times\nwhenever the [diyas](/wiki/Diya_\\(lamp\\) \"Diya \\(lamp\\)\") and torches used to\nlight up the background would snuff.[64] The song was shot at night on an\nopen-air set decorated with diyas and torches, many of which would snuff out\nwhile filming the song.[64] When it was suggested snuffed diyas should be\ncorrected in post production, Bhansali outright refused. More than twelve\npeople would run around the set with candles and oil to relight them.[64]\n\nThe sound recording was done on location. Sound designer Nihar Ranjan Samal\nsaid they had to be careful that sounds of vehicles and honking did not make\ntheir way into the recording. A number of scenes needed re-recording because\nof some disturbance.[65] _Bajirao Mastani_ was shot in 217 days between\nOctober 2014 and October 2015.[49]\n\n### Post-\nproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bajirao_Mastani&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Post-production\")]\n\nThe film contains 1,400 visual effects shots.[66] The company that worked on\nthe effects was [NY VFXWAALA](/wiki/NY_VFXWAALA \"NY VFXWAALA\"); this was the\nbiggest projects they had undertaken. [Prasad Sutar](/wiki/Prasad_Sutar\n\"Prasad Sutar\") was the visual effects supervisor; the effects took eight\nmonths and a team of sixty artists to create.[62] Although the film was shot\non highly detailed sets, visual effects and [CGI](/wiki/Computer-\ngenerated_imagery \"Computer-generated imagery\") was incorporated in post-\nproduction to enhance the imagery for the scenes that were impossible to shoot\nin live action.[62]\n\nThe effects included the creation of interior architecture, backgrounds, set\nextensions and war weapons; changes to lighting and time of day, weather\neffects and the multiplication of army soldiers.[66][62] The opening night-\ntime war scene, which had 300 visual effects shots, was [filmed in bright\ndaylight](/wiki/Day_for_night \"Day for night\") then converted into night.[38]\nArrows flying over the battlefield were created using CGI whereas the army,\nsoldiers and horses were multiplied. The war close-up shots were filmed in a\nstudio but were later mixed with the war scenes to form a detailed scene.[62]\nIn some shots, the sky was digitally replaced and CGI forts were added in\nothers.[38][46] Similarly, the climax sequence, which was shot live in water,\nwas enhanced using CGI horses, arrows and fireballs. The climax scene took\naround twenty days to complete with fine details.[62]\n\nBhansali wanted a grand opening title design, which the team decided to create\nusing animation.[62] They crafted hand-drawn storyboards and drew a narration\nof Bajirao and his kingdom, and designed it digitally using animation within a\nlimited timeline.[62] A sequence in which Singh crosses the sea in a boat at\nnight was created using visual effects. Splashing waves, falling rain falling\n(except for the water falling on Singh and the night sky were created in post\nproduction.[62] The scenes that were shot on set and featured outside views,\nsuch as views from windows, were completed in post production.[46] For dark,\nemotional scenes, a low-key background was created, whereas bright, colourful\nbackgrounds were created with effects for light scenes.[62] The film was\nedited by Rajesh G.

two\naccounts of Mastani exist– one which says she was a courtesan and Bajirao's\nmistress or concubine, and another that is depicted in the film.[143]\n\nAccording to historian Saili Palande-Datar, very little is known about the\nwomen of that era due to the [orthodoxy](/wiki/Orthodoxy \"Orthodoxy\"); women\nwere not given many privileges and rights, and most of the sources from that\nperiod are accounts of political battles, revenues and socio-economic\nrecords.[88] Palande-Datar also said there is no evidence of the way Bajirao\nand Mastani's political marriage became part of folklore and was later\ntransformed into a symbolic representation of great romance.[88] Historian\nPrachi Deshpande notes in her book _Creative Pasts: Historical Memory and\nIdentity in Western India, 1700–1960_ , that the public fascination started\nafter their romanticisation began in the 1890s, more than 150 years after they\nhad died, after Marathi playwrights began writing a series of nationalistic\nplays based on the historical figures. The first such play that portrayed them\nas a [star crossed](/wiki/Star-crossed \"Star-crossed\") couple was _Bajirao-\nMastani_ (1892) by N B Kanitkar.[88] _Quartz_ also said the play portrayed\nthem as star crossed lovers and others playwrights followed Kantikar, making\nit as familiar to Marathi audiences as that of other epic romances.[88] By the\n1930s, a number of historical novels that also added to the \"myth-making\" were\nwritten, fascinating another generation.[88] The film gives a more of a\npersonal account of Bajirao's life, which is hard to prove since it has not\nbeen covered much by the historians.[142] Bhansali has said it was his\ninterpretation of how Bajirao was in his home and in personal life, and there\nwas no way to know that.[142]\n\nBecause of this lack of information, Bhansali took liberties with historical\nfacts and exaggerated a few things for cinematic effects.[88][142] A\ndisclaimer on the film's credits stated it does not claim to be historically\naccurate.[144] The dance sequences have been widely seen as \"fictional\" and\n\"out of place\" in historical context.[145] Bajirao's dance sequence in\n\"Malhari\" has been criticised, saying a chief minister such as Bajirao would\nnever dance in public.[146] Similarly, the \"Pinga\" dance sequence between\nKashibai and Mastani has been deemed \"inappropriate\" for women of that\nera.[86]\n\nSome historians have said that apart from the inappropriateness of a woman of\nKashiabi's stature dancing in public, she suffered from a type of\n[arthritis](/wiki/Arthritis \"Arthritis\") and that dancing was not physically\npossible for her.[146] While some historians have claimed both women met\nsocially only once; others have said they never met at all.[146] Mastani was\nput under [house arrest](/wiki/House_arrest \"House arrest\") by Balaji while\nBajirao was on military campaign, as opposed to film's depiction of Mastani's\nimprisonment. The film shows Bajirao and Mastani dying at the same time in\ndifferent places, which did not happen in reality.[143] Bajirao died a few\ndays earlier than Mastani; however the cause of her death is not known. Some\nhave claimed she died from shock; other accounts say she committed suicide.\nThe film portrays Mastani being chained at the time of her death but she was\nnever chained and she and Kashibai were both present at Bajirao's last\nrites.[143][145] After the death of Mastani, Kashibai raised Mastani's son as\nher own, which is not shown in the film.[145] Other inaccuracies include\nMastani playing a [mandolin](/wiki/Mandolin \"Mandolin\"), an instrument that\noriginated in Europe during the 19th century.[144]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bajirao_Mastani&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Bajirao Mastani\"](http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/bajirao-mastani-film).
