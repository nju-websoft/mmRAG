The game, like most of the series, does\nnot have a defined final goal; gameplay is\n[nonlinear](/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay \"Nonlinear gameplay\"). The Create-a-Sim\nand Build Mode tools have been redesigned to allow more versatility when\ncreating game content. Emotional state plays a larger role in game play than\nin previous games in the series, with effects on social interaction, user\ninterface, and personality.[6][7] To date EA has released three expansion\npacks, with the most recent (_City Living_) being released in November 2016.\nThere have also been several \"game packs\" released, including _Parenthood_\nwhich allows the players to shape the characters' children and teenagers as\nthey go through life, as well as free updates that include major changes such\nas the addition of a toddler life stage.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Gameplay\n    * 1.1 Create a Sim (CAS)\n    * 1.2 Buy/build mode\n    * 1.3 The Gallery\n    * 1.4 Worlds\n  * 2 Development\n    * 2.1 Mac development\n    * 2.2 Features controversy\n  * 3 Marketing and release\n    * 3.1 Ratings\n  * 4 Expansions, add-ons and editions\n    * 4.1 Expansion packs\n    * 4.2 Game packs\n    * 4.3 Stuff packs\n    * 4.4 Additional downloadable content (DLC)\n    * 4.5 Editions\n    * 4.6 Expansion-only compilations\n  * 5 Reception\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Gameplay[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Sims_4&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Gameplay\")]\n\n_The Sims 4_ is a life simulation game, similar to its predecessors. Players\ncreate a Sim character and control their life to explore different\npersonalities which change the way the game plays out. Sims can\n[multitask](/wiki/Human_multitasking \"Human multitasking\") such as talk while\ndoing a task. Sims' moodlets also change the gameplay. For example, a Sim can\ndo a task while being either angry or totally excited.[6][7][8]\n\nSimilar to previous _Sims_ games, player-created challenges abound. One of the\nmost prevalent is the Legacy Challenge, in which players create a single Sim\nand try to make its family line last for ten generations.[9]\n\n### Create a Sim\n(CAS)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Sims_4&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Create a Sim \\(CAS\\)\")]\n\nOne major change to the _Sims 4_ Create A Sim functionality is that sliders\nhave been replaced by direct mouse click, drag and pull. Through mouse click,\ndrag and pull players may directly manipulate the facial features of a Sim.\nPlayers can also directly manipulate any body part including the abdomen,\nchest, legs, arms and feet. In previous Sims games only the fitness and\nfatness can be manipulated on a Sims body. However, fitness and fatness levels\nmay still be adjusted in _The Sims 4_ with sliders as in previous games. The\nbase games comes with over 40 hairstyles for both men and women. There are up\nto 18 hair colour options per hairstyle.\n\nSelections of premade designs of Sims are available to choose from, ranging\nfrom different body shapes to ethnicities.\n\nSeven life stages are available including baby, toddler, child, teenager,\nyoung adult, adult and elder. The baby life stage is accessible only through\nthe birth of a Sim and not available in Create A Sim. Toddlers were initially\nabsent from the original game release, but were added in the January 2017\npatch.[10][11]\n\nTraits have returned with each Sim having three traits and an aspiration\ncontaining its own hidden trait.\n\nCompared to previous Sims games where everyday, formal, sleepwear, athletic,\nparty and swimwear wardrobes were restricted to having their own clothing\noptions, all clothing options are now available across all forms of wardrobe\nand players are allowed up to 5 outfits per category. There is also a filter\npanel where clothing options can be sorted by color, material, outfit\ncategory, fashion choice, style, content and packs.\n\nIn a Summer 2016 update, gender options were expanded in the game, allowing\nany gender expression. Now all the haircuts and outfits can be worn by any Sim\nof any gender, and pregnancy can become a possibility regardless of the\ngender.\n\n### Buy/build mode[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Sims_4&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Buy/build mode\")]\n\nIn _The Sims 4_ , build and buy modes have been combined and is now treated as\na single feature.\n\nA detailed build-and-buy system is present along with neighborhoods and\nlandscaping. Some locked buy mode items may be unlocked through the\nprogression of career levels.\n\nEntire buildings and rooms can now be moved across the lot. Wall heights can\nalso now be adjusted.\n\nThere is also a pool tool feature, with a custom version and triangular,\nsquare and octagonal pool tools too.\n\nThere are build mode [cheats](/wiki/Cheat_code \"Cheat code\") such as\n\"motherlode\", which enables the player to automatically gain §50,000\n(simoleons) to buy things with.\n\nThere is now a search option to search for build and buy mode options. When\nbuilding a house for your sim you can buy already made rooms which can help\nbut costs a lot of money depending on the style of the room.\n\n### The Gallery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Sims_4&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: The Gallery\")]\n\n_The Sims 4_ includes social features, such as importing Sims and houses other\npeople have made from The Gallery into the player's game. This impacts the\nworld around the player's Sims. Players may publish their creations into the\nGallery for other players to download into their game instantly.\n\nOn January 9, 2015, EA released a version of The Gallery for iOS and Android\ndevices.[12]\n\n### Worlds[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Sims_4&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Worlds\")]\n\n_The Sims 4_ base game originally shipped with two worlds: Willow Creek and\nOasis Springs. Both worlds contain five neighborhoods and a total of 21 lots.\nWith the release of _Outdoor Retreat_ , the world Granite Falls was available\nfor visiting on outdoor vacations. Newcrest became available with a free\nupdate, having three neighborhoods with five empty lots in each, for a total\nof 15 lots.[13] Magnolia Promenade came with the _Get to Work_ Expansion Pack,\nand Windenburg was introduced in the _Get Together_ Expansion Pack.[14] The\n_City Living_ Expansion Pack, released in November 2016, introduced the new\nbustling city of San Myshuno. The _Vampires_ Game Pack added the neighborhood\nForgotten Hollow.\n\n## Development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Sims_4&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n_The Sims 4_ was developed by [The Sims Studio](/wiki/The_Sims_Studio \"The\nSims Studio\"), a division of the [Electronic Arts](/wiki/Electronic_Arts\n\"Electronic Arts\") subsidiary [Maxis](/wiki/Maxis \"Maxis\"), and was\ndistributed by Electronic Arts.[15] This is similar yet different to the\ndevelopment of _[The Sims 3](/wiki/The_Sims_3 \"The Sims 3\")_ , which was\ndeveloped by The Sims Studio standalone from the (at the time) diminished\nMaxis.\n\n_The Sims 4_ is a [single-player](/wiki/Single-player_video_game \"Single-\nplayer video game\") game,[16] and does not require a constant Internet\nconnection to play. Players will however need an\n[Origin](/wiki/Origin_\\(digital_distribution_software\\) \"Origin \\(digital\ndistribution software\\)\") account and Internet access during the initial\ninstallation process for game activation.[17] [Ilan\nEshkeri](/wiki/Ilan_Eshkeri \"Ilan Eshkeri\") serves as the composer for the\ngame's orchestral soundtrack, which was recorded at [Abbey Road\nStudios](/wiki/Abbey_Road_Studios \"Abbey Road Studios\") and performed by the\n[London Metropolitan Orchestra](/wiki/London_Metropolitan_Orchestra \"London\nMetropolitan Orchestra\").[18][19]\n\nOn April 25, 2013, several screenshots from mock-up flash videos of the user\ninterface were leaked online.[20] On May 3, 2013, Electronic Arts sent out an\ne-mail to several fansites stating that there would be a big announcement on\nMay 6, 2013, which many speculated would be _The Sims 4_.[21]\n\nOn August 20, 2013, _The Sims 4_ was revealed via gameplay demo and release\ntrailer at [Gamescom](/wiki/Gamescom \"Gamescom\"). Previews of the building and\ncharacter creation systems debuted earlier in 2014. Additional game footage\nand the release date were revealed at the [Electronic Entertainment\nExpo](/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo \"Electronic Entertainment Expo\") on\nJune 9, 2014.[1]\n\nGameplay was unveiled during [Gamescom 2013](/wiki/Gamescom \"Gamescom\"), held\nat the [Koelnmesse](/wiki/Koelnmesse \"Koelnmesse\") in [Cologne,\nGermany](/wiki/Cologne \"Cologne\"). Unveiled features focused on the improved\nCreate-a-Sim with an all-new click-and-drag feature omitting the use of\nsliders and the addition of emotion-based gameplay.[22] Select players called\nYibsims who mostly manage fan sites and YouTube videos were invited to Sims\nCamp to see the game before the public and press, consequently the game\nreceived minimal coverage outside fansites. Maxis stated the game would run\nbetter on lower-end PCs than _The Sims 3_ , which was plagued with performance\nissues on low-end and high-end PCs.[23]\n\nIt was suspected that _The Sims 4_ was scheduled to be released in early 2014,\nbut it was later revealed it would in fact be released September 2,\n2014.[1][24]\n\nOn May 14, 2014, producer Ryan Vaughan unveiled another Create-a-Sim trailer\non the official The Sims YouTube channel. This included a preview of what the\npremade Sims Bella Goth and Mortimer Goth would look like in _The Sims 4_.[25]\nThe development team unveiled another trailer on May 28, 2014 that showcased\nthe new Build Mode features. Players will now be able to choose between three\ndifferent wall heights and adjust the location of a window on a wall, as well\nas be able to move an entire room from one position to another.[26]\n\nEA unveiled another gameplay trailer including more gameplay footage and\nannounced the release date of the game, September 2, 2014, during a press\nconference at the [Electronic Entertainment\nExpo](/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo \"Electronic Entertainment Expo\") on\nJune 9, 2014. _The Sims 4_ was released on September 2 for North America and\nSeptember 4 for [EU](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\"),\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") and [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil\n\"Brazil\").[1]\n\nOn June 28, 2014, a video was released showing the \"originality\" of each sim\nand their emotions.[27]\n\nIn January 2015, Maxis announced _[Outdoor\nRetreat](/wiki/The_Sims_4:_Outdoor_Retreat \"The Sims 4: Outdoor Retreat\")_ ,\nthe first paid [DLC](/wiki/Downloadable_content \"Downloadable content\") for\n_The Sims 4_.[28] The DLC focuses on outdoor activities in the national park.\n\nUntil mid-2017, there were no plans for a console release.[29][30] However,\nversions of the game for the [PlayStation 4](/wiki/PlayStation_4 \"PlayStation\n4\") and [Xbox One](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox One\") were officially confirmed for\nrelease on 17 November 2017.[31]\n\n### Mac development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Sims_4&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Mac development\")]\n\nUpon first announcement, EA stated that _The Sims 4_ was in development for\nboth for Mac and [Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\"), both\nto be released in 2014.[32] However, closer to release date, the company\nstated that they were \"focused [on] Windows\"[33] and had \"no updates on the\nMac at this time\".[34] In October 2014 further information was disclosed\nsuggesting the future release of a Mac version. Vaughn told [International\nBusiness Times](/wiki/International_Business_Times \"International Business\nTimes\") that the team was \"working on a Mac version right now.\"[35] On January\n13, 2015, EA confirmed the release of the Mac version as being February\n2015.[36] On February 2, they announced via the official The Sims\n[Twitter](/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\") feed that the Mac version of The Sims 4\nwould be released on February 17.[2]\n\n### Features\ncontroversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Sims_4&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Features controversy\")]\n\nOn June 25, 2014, EA and Maxis announced the omission of several gameplay\nfeatures in _The Sims 4_ that had been included in previous games. These\nomitted features include swimming pools, swimming wear, and the \"toddler\" life\nstage; this announcement also noted the lack of an [open-\nworld](/wiki/Open_world \"Open world\") found in _The Sims 3_ , stating\nneighborhood gameplay would be separated by loading screens.[37][38] Earlier\nin the development process, a fan-site interview with a producer had revealed\nCreate-a-Style (CAS), a customization feature introduced in the previous\n_Sims_ game, would not be added to _The Sims 4_ in lieu of other features.[39]\nThe developers then announced through a series of tweets that the game would\nship with a 'stripped-down' version of story-progression (a gameplay mechanic\ncontrolling neighborhood autonomy), and that basements, grocery stores, and\nschool and work locations would not be featured in the game. While careers and\nschools would still be featured, they would be represented differently from\n_The Sims 3,_ more akin to the way they were featured in _[The Sims\n2](/wiki/The_Sims_2 \"The Sims 2\")_.[40][41][42]\n\nThese announcements sparked unrest among many fans who speculated that the\nexclusion of arguably core features were intended by the developers or parent\ncompany to be left out for later paid content, or in order to make rushed\ndeadlines.[43][44] A [petition](/wiki/Petition \"Petition\") was launched by\nsome fans to have the features restored for the initial release, even if the\nrelease date were to be pushed back.[45]\n\nMaxis contended that it was not possible to include every feature in the new\ngame that had been added over time in the six years _The Sims 3_ was in\ndevelopment, and that these could always be added at a later date, although\nthey did not confirm exactly how this would be done, or whether it would be\nfree or at a cost.[44] Some have speculated that many new features would be\nreleased through paid expansion packs, but others speculated that some of the\nmore \"basic, core\" content (i.e. pools, toddlers) may be released as free\npatch updates, similar to how some new features were patched free into _The\nSims 3,_ such as basement features.[46]\n\nQuestioned as to why some features, such as a cupcake machine, were\nimplemented over what many viewed as key gameplay, Maxis and _The Sims_\nproducer Graham Nardone attributed the sacrifice to time constraints, the\nworkload and distribution of developers (and the comparative lack of available\ndevelopers to some areas of production to other areas), as well as risk\nfactors:[47]\n\n> You can't weigh features by how much you want them in the game, you have to\n> consider how many development resources it takes to create them. The tram? A\n> couple of days from one of our FX guys and it's finished... very low risk,\n> very low complexity (using entirely existing tech), and adds a nice visual\n> punch to the neighborhood. I can’t recall ever scoping against FX... they\n> always have time to be adding more stuff.\n>\n> Our FX folks submitted their own long list of things they wanted to work on\n> because there wasn’t enough for them to do. Now, you can’t take the FX team\n> and ask them to add pools to the game. They don’t have the work skills to do\n> it; neither do I. Pools, toddlers... they’re extremely complex features that\n> require months of man hours of work across multiple disciplines and\n> introduce significant risk.\n>\n> If we were to have added one of those to the game, there would have been two\n> choices for us... cut many small features, or cut one other significantly\n> large feature.\n\nMaxis and _The Sims_ producer Rachel Rubin Franklin later elaborated in an\nofficial blog post, acknowledging the concerns of fans, and explained the\nissue on the developer's focus on _The Sims 4_ 's new core game engine\ntechnologies, and that the sacrifices the team had to make were a \"hard pill\nto swallow\":\n\n> It begins with new technology and systems that we built for this new base\n> game for _The Sims_... the vision for _The Sims 4_ is a new experience... to\n> do that, our technology base needed a major upgrade.\n>\n> ...when we sat down and looked at everything we wanted to do for this game,\n> all the new tech we wanted to build into it, the fact was that there would\n> be trade-offs, and these would disappoint some of our fans. Hard pill to\n> swallow, believe me, but delivering on the vision set out for _The Sims 4_\n> required focus.\n\nFranklin stated new features such as Sim emotions, advanced Sim animation,\ninteraction and behaviours, as well as the new Create-a-Sim and build mode\ntools as a large part of the reason that detracted focus from features such as\nswimming pools and the toddler life stage.[48]\n\nHowever, on October 1, 2014, Maxis confirmed that one of its missing features,\nswimming pools, along with other new updates and features, would be added into\nthe game for free in November, and this happened in the form of a [game\npatch](/wiki/Patch_\\(computing\\) \"Patch \\(computing\\)\").[49][50][51] Other\nfeatures like basements have later been added in subsequent patches, and the\nmissing \"toddler\" life stage was eventually added for free in a patch released\non January 12, 2017.[10][11]\n\nSignificant features added via game patches Patch release date | Significant features added[52][53][54]  \n---|---  \nOctober 1, 2014 | Added Ghost, a new type of sim that is an optional addition to the game, the Deathflower plant, and the \"Ambrosia\" cooking recipe; [Star Wars](/wiki/Star_Wars \"Star Wars\") costumes: [Yoda](/wiki/Yoda \"Yoda\"), [Princess Leia](/wiki/Princess_Leia \"Princess Leia\"), [Luke Skywalker](/wiki/Luke_Skywalker \"Luke Skywalker\"), and [Darth Vader](/wiki/Darth_Vader \"Darth Vader\").  \nNovember 4, 2014 | Swimming pools; various swimwear  \nDecember 16, 2014 | Two new active careers: Business and Athletic; Paid Time Off and Family Leave options.  \nFebruary 3, 2015 | Genealogy panel, displaying a Sim's family tree.  \nMarch 26, 2015 | Basements, down to two levels down, and an additional above ground floor, bringing the total floors available to six; the Notebook feature on the phone, which catalogs a Sim's gardening or fishing discoveries; Paint by Reference option on the easel  \nMay 4, 2015 | New Star Wars costumes: [Boba Fett](/wiki/Boba_Fett \"Boba Fett\"), [Darth Maul](/wiki/Darth_Maul \"Darth Maul\"), and [Aayla Secura](/wiki/Aayla_Secura \"Aayla Secura\"); revamped loading screen.  \nJune 11, 2015 | Newcrest, a new world containing fifteen empty lots within three new neighborhoods; the Welcome Wagon from new neighbors; the Custom Room Tool  \nJuly 9, 2015 | Half walls; locked doors; King’s and Queen’s Door, which allow only just the men or women to pass through it, respectively; towel full body outfits.  \nAugust 6, 2015 | A dishwasher is added to the appliances, which needs to be slotted into an existing non-island counter.  \nSeptember 24, 2015 | New trait Jealous; Limited Interaction Trick or Treat; Claiming beds; Resizeable rugs; Underground Saunas.  \nNovember 3, 2015 | New Hire Service: Repair Man.  \nDecember 4, 2015 | 64-bit executable; Automatically disable mods after patch; Change in Sims groups; New [NPC](/wiki/Non_playable_character \"Non playable character\") Interaction; Fire and Death Reaction Systems; New Venue Type: Pool and New Option to color water; World maps updated; Put grills in inventory.  \nJanuary 7, 2016 | Modified Sims reactions to inappropriate neighbors and fights; New Wall Decorations;  \nFebruary 4, 2016 | New Trait: Kleptomaniac; New Hire Service: Gardener; New Aspiration; New Content in Build Mode.  \nApril 21, 2016 | Returning NPC: Tragic Clown.  \nMay 19, 2016 | Females are given two male hairstyles.  \nJune 3, 2016 | All Create-a-Sim content is available to both sexes, as well as gender customization[55]  \nJune 23, 2016 | Child Sims can now experience a 'Monster-Under-The-Bed', appearing as tentacles which children can either befriend or ask Adults to Spray.

the game before release.[91] In the absence of\ninitial reviews it was indicated that players were generally dissatisfied with\nthe game, especially the ones who were familiar with the previous games in the\nfranchise.[92]\n\nAt the aggregator site [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\"), _The Sims\n4_ received a score of 70 based on 74 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average\"\nreception.[4]\n\n[Hardcore Gamer](/wiki/Hardcore_Gamer \"Hardcore Gamer\") gave _The Sims 4_ a\n2.5 score out of 5 and commented \"it’s a half-hearted experience wrapped in a\nneat and pretty package that beams a potential to both fulfill and crush your\ninner-Sims’ dreams.\" They criticized the game for the lack of content and\nhaving many [bugs](/wiki/Software_bug \"Software bug\").[93]\n\nJim Sterling of _[The Escapist](/wiki/The_Escapist_\\(magazine\\) \"The Escapist\n\\(magazine\\)\"),_ in a mixed review of the game, found there to be an \"overall\nlack of engagement.\" Although noting some positive changes he was critical of\nthe game in comparison to previous entries in the series, declaring that \"_The\nSims 4_ is basically _[The Sims 3](/wiki/The_Sims_3 \"The Sims 3\")_ , but\nshrunken and sterile,\" and recommending that game be played instead. He also\ncomplained of being \"harassed\" by tutorial messages. His final score for the\ngame was 2.5 out of 5 stars.[94]\n\n[ABCNews.com](/wiki/ABCNews.com \"ABCNews.com\")'s reviewer Derrik J. Lang\npraised the game for being \"remarkably more intuitive at the start,\" stating\nthat the Sims are now smarter than before, have emotions that affect their\nmoods, and are able to multi-task. Despite the praise, Lang awarded the game\nwith two stars stating that he encountered annoying glitches and that he\nmisses content from previous games, like dishwashers.[95]\n\nKevin VanOrd of [GameSpot](/wiki/GameSpot \"GameSpot\") gave this game a 6 out\nof 10. Despite praising the visuals, audio, and the new multi-tasking and\nmoods system, he states that he misses the two main features of _The Sims 3_ :\n\"Create-a-Style\" and the open world. His conclusion is: \"The Sims 4's biggest\nproblem is that The Sims 3 exists\".[96]\n\nOther reviews were more favorable. [CraveOnline](/wiki/CraveOnline\n\"CraveOnline\").co.uk mentioned in an article that \"the awful user reviews\nindicate a strong backlash.\" However, the website added that \"_Sims_ fans who\nhaven’t paid much attention to the ongoing controversy surrounding the game\nmay look at those [Amazon](/wiki/Amazon.com \"Amazon.com\") review scores and,\nwithout knowing that many are immediately dismissing the game due to its cut\ncontent, decide that they won’t purchase it.\"[97]\n\nKallie Plagge of [IGN](/wiki/IGN \"IGN\") gave _The Sims 4_ a 7.5 out of 10. She\nwas disappointed by the lack of content from previous games, and the lack of\n\"cool\" objects that could adequately replace them; and the too frequent,\nalbeit short, loading screens. The score she gave is relatively high, though,\nbecause \"The Sims 4 does succeed in being a deep and complex game when it\ncomes to Sim interactions, with lots of entertaining emotional potential [...]\nPlus, excellent building tools make architecture more fun than ever\". Her\nconclusion is that \"it’s a good start to what may eventually be expanded into\na great Sims game, but it’s not there yet\".[98]\n\n_[The Independent](/wiki/The_Independent \"The Independent\")'_s Jack Fleming\npraised the game for \"The Gallery\" feature that allows users to showcase their\ncreations easily, the new multitasking system, the visual design, the\npersonalities and emotions, the unusual careers (that, for example, allow the\nsim to travel into space), and the new build mode. On the other hand, he\nvoiced his frustration with the loading screens, the new camera controls\n(while noting they can be reverted to _The Sims 3_ style), and noted the lack\nof content from previous installments (such as swimming pools and toddlers)\nmade many fans upset. In conclusion he writes: \"_The Sims 4_ is an easy game\nto get into (though the constant tutorial-ising at the start can actually get\na bit frustrating) and the reasons that people love this series are still\npresent. The game’s creators have tried to make the appeal as diverse as\npossible and have in most ways succeeded. However, I couldn’t help but wish I\ncould actually go to space and drive that spaceship around...\"[99]\n\nNick Tan of [Game Revolution](/wiki/Game_Revolution \"Game Revolution\") states\nthat the game is a case study for [loss aversion](/wiki/Loss_aversion \"Loss\naversion\"). He explains that the reason for _Sims_ fans expressing so much\nanger and dissatisfaction with it is because people \"strongly prefer avoiding\nlosses than acquiring gains\". That, combined with the [hatred for Electronic\nArts](/wiki/Electronic_Arts#Controversies \"Electronic Arts\") that greatly\nintensified after the release of the latest\n_[SimCity](/wiki/SimCity_\\(2013_video_game\\) \"SimCity \\(2013 video game\\)\")_\ngame, resulted in such a backlash. Tan gave _The Sims 4_ a 3.5/5, calling it\n\"woefully incomplete, despite being unexpectedly solid and entertaining in its\ncurrent state\".[100]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Sims_4&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ Jackson, Leah B.
