        "# Xanthophyll\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Cryptoxanthin.png/400px-\nCryptoxanthin.png)](/wiki/File:Cryptoxanthin.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cryptoxanthin.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe chemical structure of [cryptoxanthin](/wiki/Cryptoxanthin \"Cryptoxanthin\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Raw_egg.jpg/220px-\nRaw_egg.jpg)](/wiki/File:Raw_egg.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Raw_egg.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe color of an egg yolk is from the xanthophyll carotenoids lutein and\nzeaxanthin\n\nThis article is about Xanthophylls. For the compound xanthophyll, see\n[lutein](/wiki/Lutein \"Lutein\").\n\n**Xanthophylls** (originally **phylloxanthins**) are yellow\n[pigments](/wiki/Pigment \"Pigment\") that occur widely in nature and form one\nof two major divisions of the [carotenoid](/wiki/Carotenoid \"Carotenoid\")\ngroup; the other division is formed by the [carotenes](/wiki/Carotene\n\"Carotene\"). The name is from Greek _xanthos_ (ξανθός, \"yellow\")[1] and\n_phyllon_ (φύλλον, \"leaf\"),[2] due to their formation of the yellow band seen\nin early [chromatography](/wiki/History_of_chromatography \"History of\nchromatography\") of [leaf](/wiki/Leaf \"Leaf\") pigments.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Molecular structure\n  * 2 Occurrence\n  * 3 Example compounds\n  * 4 Xanthophyll cycle\n  * 5 Food sources\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Molecular\nstructure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Xanthophyll&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Molecular structure\")]\n\nThe molecular structure of xanthophylls is similar to that of\n[carotenes](/wiki/Carotene \"Carotene\"), but xanthophylls contain\n[oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\") atoms, while _carotenes_ are purely\nhydrocarbons with no oxygen. Xanthophylls contain their oxygen either as\n[hydroxyl groups](/wiki/Hydroxyl_group \"Hydroxyl group\") and/or as pairs of\nhydrogen atoms that are substituted by oxygen atoms acting as a bridge\n([epoxide](/wiki/Epoxide \"Epoxide\")). For this reason, they are more\n[polar](/wiki/Polar_molecule \"Polar molecule\") than the purely hydrocarbon\ncarotenes, and it is this difference that allows their separations from\ncarotenes in many types of [chromatography](/wiki/Chromatography\n\"Chromatography\"). Typically, carotenes are more orange in color than\nxanthophylls.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Chromatography_of_chlorophyll_-\n_Step_7.jpg/100px-Chromatography_of_chlorophyll_-\n_Step_7.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chromatography_of_chlorophyll_-_Step_7.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chromatography_of_chlorophyll_-_Step_7.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThin layer chromatography is used to separate components of a plant extract,\nillustrating the experiment with plant pigments that gave chromatography its\nname. Plant xanthophylls form the bright yellow band next to the green\n\n## Occurrence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Xanthophyll&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Occurrence\")]\n\nLike other carotenoids, xanthophylls are found in highest quantity in the\n[leaves](/wiki/Leaves \"Leaves\") of most green [plants](/wiki/Plants \"Plants\"),\nwhere they act to modulate light energy and perhaps serve as a [non-\nphotochemical quenching](/wiki/Non-photochemical_quenching \"Non-photochemical\nquenching\") agent to deal with triplet [chlorophyll](/wiki/Chlorophyll\n\"Chlorophyll\") (an excited form of chlorophyll)[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_], which\nis overproduced at high light levels in photosynthesis. The xanthophylls found\nin the bodies of animals, and in dietary animal products, are ultimately\nderived from plant sources in the diet. For example, the yellow color of\nchicken [egg](/wiki/Egg_\\(biology\\) \"Egg \\(biology\\)\") [yolks](/wiki/Yolk\n\"Yolk\"), fat, and skin comes from ingested xanthophylls (primarily\n[lutein](/wiki/Lutein \"Lutein\"), which is often added to chicken feed for this\npurpose).\n\nThe yellow color of the human [macula lutea](/wiki/Macula_lutea \"Macula\nlutea\") (literally, _yellow spot_) in the [retina](/wiki/Retina \"Retina\") of\nthe eye results from the [lutein](/wiki/Lutein \"Lutein\") and\n[zeaxanthin](/wiki/Zeaxanthin \"Zeaxanthin\") it contains, both xanthophylls\nagain requiring a source in the human diet to be present in the eye. These\nxanthophylls protect the eye from ionizing blue and ultraviolet light, which\nthey absorb. These two specific xanthophylls do not function in the mechanism\nof sight, since they cannot be converted to [retinal](/wiki/Retinal \"Retinal\")\n(also called retinaldehyde or [vitamin A](/wiki/Vitamin_A \"Vitamin A\")\naldehyde). Their arrangement is believed to be the cause of [Haidinger's\nbrush](/wiki/Haidinger%27s_brush \"Haidinger's brush\"), an [entoptic\nphenomenon](/wiki/Entoptic_phenomenon \"Entoptic phenomenon\") that allows the\nperception of the [polarization](/wiki/Polarization_\\(waves\\) \"Polarization\n\\(waves\\)\") of light.\n\n## Example\ncompounds[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Xanthophyll&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Example compounds\")]\n\nThe group of xanthophylls includes (among many other compounds)\n[lutein](/wiki/Lutein \"Lutein\"), [zeaxanthin](/wiki/Zeaxanthin \"Zeaxanthin\"),\n[neoxanthin](/wiki/Neoxanthin \"Neoxanthin\"), [violaxanthin](/wiki/Violaxanthin\n\"Violaxanthin\"), [flavoxanthin](/wiki/Flavoxanthin \"Flavoxanthin\"), and α- and\nβ-[cryptoxanthin](/wiki/Cryptoxanthin \"Cryptoxanthin\"). The latter compound is\nthe only known **xanthophyll** to contain a beta-ionone ring, and thus\nβ-[cryptoxanthin](/wiki/Cryptoxanthin \"Cryptoxanthin\") is the only xanthophyll\nthat is known to possess pro-vitamin A activity for mammals. Even then, it is\na vitamin only for plant-eating mammals that possess the enzyme to make\nretinal from carotenoids that contain beta-ionone (some carnivores lack this\nenzyme). In species other than mammals, certain xanthophylls may be converted\nto hydroxylated retinal-analogues that function directly in vision. For\nexample, with the exception of certain flies, most insects use the xanthophyll\nderived R-isomer of 3-hydroxyretinal for visual activities, which means that\nβ-[cryptoxanthin](/wiki/Cryptoxanthin \"Cryptoxanthin\") and other xanthophylls\n(such as lutein and zeaxanthin) may function as forms of visual \"vitamin A\"\nfor them, while carotenes (such as beta carotene) do not.\n\n## Xanthophyll\ncycle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Xanthophyll&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Xanthophyll cycle\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Violaxanthin_cycle.png/400px-\nViolaxanthin_cycle.png)](/wiki/File:Violaxanthin_cycle.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Violaxanthin_cycle.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe xanthophyll cycle\n\nThe xanthophyll cycle involves the enzymatic removal of epoxy groups from\nxanthophylls (e.g. [violaxanthin](/wiki/Violaxanthin \"Violaxanthin\"),\n[antheraxanthin](/wiki/Antheraxanthin \"Antheraxanthin\"),\n[diadinoxanthin](/wiki/Diadinoxanthin \"Diadinoxanthin\")) to create so-called\nde-epoxidised xanthophylls (e.g. [diatoxanthin](/wiki/Diatoxanthin\n\"Diatoxanthin\"), [zeaxanthin](/wiki/Zeaxanthin \"Zeaxanthin\")). These enzymatic\ncycles were found to play a key role in stimulating energy dissipation within\nlight-harvesting antenna proteins by [non-photochemical quenching](/wiki/Non-\nphotochemical_quenching \"Non-photochemical quenching\")\\- a mechanism to reduce\nthe amount of energy that reaches the photosynthetic reaction centers. Non-\nphotochemical quenching is one of the main ways of protecting against\n[photoinhibition](/wiki/Photoinhibition \"Photoinhibition\").[3] In higher\nplants, there are three carotenoid pigments that are active in the xanthophyll\ncycle: violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin. During light stress,\nviolaxanthin is converted to zeaxanthin via the intermediate antheraxanthin,\nwhich plays a direct photoprotective role acting as a lipid-protective [anti-\noxidant](/wiki/Anti-oxidant \"Anti-oxidant\") and by stimulating non-\nphotochemical quenching within light-harvesting proteins. This conversion of\nviolaxanthin to zeaxanthin is done by the enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase,\nwhile the reverse reaction is performed by zeaxanthin epoxidase.[4]\n\nIn [diatoms](/wiki/Diatoms \"Diatoms\") and\n[dinoflagellates](/wiki/Dinoflagellates \"Dinoflagellates\"), the xanthophyll\ncycle consists of the pigment [diadinoxanthin](/wiki/Diadinoxanthin\n\"Diadinoxanthin\"), which is transformed into [diatoxanthin](/wiki/Diatoxanthin\n\"Diatoxanthin\") (diatoms) or [dinoxanthin](/wiki/Dinoxanthin \"Dinoxanthin\")\n(dinoflagellates) under high-light conditions.[5]\n\nWright et al. (Feb 2011) found that, \"The increase in zeaxanthin appears to\nsurpass the decrease in violaxanthin in spinach\" and commented that the\ndiscrepancy could be explained by \"a synthesis of zeaxanthin from beta-\ncarotene\", however they noted further study is required to explore this\nhypothesis.[6]\n\n## Food sources[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Xanthophyll&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Food sources\")]\n\nXanthophylls are found in all young leaves and in [etiolated](/wiki/Etiolation\n\"Etiolation\") leaves. Examples of other rich sources include papaya, peaches,\nprunes, and squash, which contain lutein diesters.[7][8][9]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Xanthophyll&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [ξανθός](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=canqo/s).
