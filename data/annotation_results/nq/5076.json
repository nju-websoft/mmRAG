Under Speegle's tutelage, the Cowboys compiled a record\nof 36–42–3, which included three winning seasons from 1957 to 1959.[3] The\nlosing record, combined with an 0–8 mark against rival Oklahoma, resulted in\nSpeegle's firing following the 1962 season.\n\nIn 1956, A&M announced it was joining (or rejoining, depending on one's view)\nwhat had become the Big Seven for the 1958–59 academic year. As part of a\ntransition period, the Cowboys went independent for two years. On May 15,\n1957, Oklahoma A&M changed its name to Oklahoma State University. They\nofficially became a part of the renamed [Big Eight\nConference](/wiki/Big_Eight_Conference \"Big Eight Conference\") in 1958.\n\n### Phil Cutchin era\n(1963–1968)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Phil Cutchin era \\(1963–1968\\)\")]\n\nLongtime [Bear Bryant](/wiki/Bear_Bryant \"Bear Bryant\") assistant [Phil\nCutchin](/wiki/Phil_Cutchin \"Phil Cutchin\") led Oklahoma State to its first\nwin over Oklahoma in 20 years, but failed to bring success to Stillwater,\ncompiling a mark of 19–38–2.

He coached them from 1973 to\n1978, amassing a career record of 35–31–2. Stanley's Cowboys earned a [Fiesta\nBowl](/wiki/Fiesta_Bowl \"Fiesta Bowl\") victory in 1974 and his 1976 team ended\nthe season 9–3 finishing as a Big Eight tri-champions on their way to a\n[Tangerine Bowl](/wiki/Tangerine_Bowl_\\(1947%E2%80%931982\\) \"Tangerine Bowl\n\\(1947–1982\\)\") victory.[7] His success at Oklahoma State earned him many\naccolades, including being invited to coach three collegiate all-star games:\nthe 1973 East–West Shrine Game, the 1977 Hula Bowl, and the 1977 Japan Bowl.\n\nIn 1978, the Big Eight Conference initiated an investigation into the OSU\nfootball program in response to allegations of violations of several NCAA\nrules and regulations while Stanley was head coach. Stanley successfully filed\nsuit against the conference to require them to provide various due process\nprotections in their final hearing on the charges.\n\n### Jimmy Johnson era\n(1979–1983)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Jimmy Johnson era \\(1979–1983\\)\")]\n\nIn 1979, [Jimmy Johnson](/wiki/Jimmy_Johnson_\\(American_football_coach\\)\n\"Jimmy Johnson \\(American football coach\\)\") got the head coaching job at\nOklahoma State. Johnson's successful rebuilding of the inconsistent Cowboys\nfootball program is a hallmark in the long history of Cowboy football. In his\nfinal season, he led the Cowboys to an 8–4 record and a 24–14 victory over\n20th-ranked [Baylor](/wiki/Baylor_Bears_football \"Baylor Bears football\") in\nthe Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl. The season included a season opening romp over then\n#12 ranked [Arizona State](/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_football \"Arizona\nState Sun Devils football\") in [Tempe](/wiki/Tempe,_Arizona \"Tempe, Arizona\"),\nand a [Bedlam](/wiki/Bedlam_Series \"Bedlam Series\") matchup between the #2\nranked [Oklahoma Sooners](/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners \"Oklahoma Sooners\") and the\n#3-ranked Cowboys on November 24, 1984. A game in which the Cowboys ultimately\nlost, 24–14.[8]\n\nIn 1984, when he was offered the head coaching job at Miami, Jimmy Johnson was\nunsure if he wanted to leave Stillwater. His good friend Larry Lacewell told\nJohnson that if he wanted to win a national championship and eventually coach\nin the NFL he had to take the Miami job. Johnson soon after accepted the head\ncoaching job at Miami.[9] Jimmy Johnson left OSU with an overall record of\n29–25–3.[10]\n\n### Pat Jones era\n(1984–1994)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Pat Jones era \\(1984–1994\\)\")]\n\n[Pat Jones](/wiki/Pat_Jones_\\(American_football\\) \"Pat Jones \\(American\nfootball\\)\") was promoted from assistant coach to head coach following\nJohnson's departure. He served as head coach of the Oklahoma State Cowboys\nfrom 1984 to 1994 after five years as an assistant under Jimmy Johnson. During\nhis 11 years at Oklahoma State, he compiled a 62–60–3 record, including a 3–1\nbowl game record. Jones was named Big Eight Coach of the Year in both 1984 and\n1992. From 1984 to 1988, Jones led the Cowboys to the most successful period\nin school history at the time. With a talented roster that included running\nbacks [Barry Sanders](/wiki/Barry_Sanders \"Barry Sanders\") and [Thurman\nThomas](/wiki/Thurman_Thomas \"Thurman Thomas\"), wide receiver [Hart Lee\nDykes](/wiki/Hart_Lee_Dykes \"Hart Lee Dykes\") and quarterback [Mike\nGundy](/wiki/Mike_Gundy \"Mike Gundy\"), they went 44–15 over this five-year\nstretch, including the school's first three-year stretch of ten-win seasons.\n\nRunning back Barry Sanders played for the Cowboys from 1986 to 1988. During\nhis first two seasons at Oklahoma State, he backed up All-American Thurman\nThomas. In 1987, Sanders led the nation in yards per kickoff return (31.6),\nwhile also rushing for over 600 yards and scoring 8 touchdowns. Thomas moved\non to the NFL, and Sanders became the starter for his junior year.\n\nIn 1988, in what has been called the greatest individual season in college\nfootball history,[11] Sanders led the nation by averaging 7.6 yards per carry\nand over 200 yards per game, including rushing for over 300 yards in four\ngames. Despite his massive workload of 344 carries, Sanders was still used as\nthe team's punt and kickoff returner, adding another 516 yards on special\nteams. He set college football season records with 2,628 yards rushing, 3,248\ntotal yards, 234 points, 39 touchdowns, 37 rushing touchdowns, 5 consecutive\n200 yard games, scored at least 2 touchdowns in 11 consecutive games, and 9\ntimes he scored at least 3 touchdowns.[12] Sanders also ran for 222 yards and\nscored 5 touchdowns in his three quarters of action in the [1988 Holiday\nBowl](/wiki/1988_Holiday_Bowl \"1988 Holiday Bowl\"), a game that is not\nincluded in the official NCAA season statistics.[13] Sanders learned of his\n[Heisman Trophy](/wiki/Heisman_Trophy \"Heisman Trophy\") win while he was with\nthe team in Tokyo, Japan, preparing to face [Texas\nTech](/wiki/1988_Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders_football_team \"1988 Texas Tech Red\nRaiders football team\") in the [Coca-Cola Classic](/wiki/Coca-\nCola_Classic_\\(college_football\\) \"Coca-Cola Classic \\(college\nfootball\\)\").[14] He chose to leave Oklahoma State before his senior season to\nenter the NFL draft.\n\nDays after the 1988 season, Oklahoma State and the NCAA released the results\nof an unusual joint investigation into the football program. The investigation\nrevealed several major violations dating prior to Johnson's tenure,\nprincipally involvement in a \"bidding war\" for Dykes out of high school. The\nCowboys were banned from bowl games for three years and from live television\nfor two years, and they were also limited to 20 scholarships from 1989 to\n1992. Jones was not directly implicated in any wrongdoing; indeed, the\ninvestigation found that no violations had taken place in two years. He was\nunable to put together another winning team due to the sanctions, and left OSU\nafter the 1994 season. In Jones' last six years, the Cowboys won only seven\ngames in Big Eight play, including three seasons of winless conference\nrecords. Oklahoma State would need almost the entire decade of the 1990s to\nrecover; with only one winning season coming between 1989 and 2001.\n\n### Bob Simmons era\n(1995–2000)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Bob Simmons era \\(1995–2000\\)\")]\n\n[Bob Simmons](/wiki/Bob_Simmons_\\(football_coach\\) \"Bob Simmons \\(football\ncoach\\)\") came to OSU from his post as defensive line coach at\n[Colorado](/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football \"Colorado Buffaloes football\") to\nreplace Jones. Simmons' teams were largely unsuccessful, and Simmons resigned\nunder pressure following the 2000 season. His final record in Stillwater was\n30–38 with just one winning campaign, an 8–4 season in 1997 that culminated in\na loss in the Alamo Bowl.[15] In 1996, OSU joined with the other Big Eight\nschools and four schools from the old Southwest Conference to form the [Big 12\nConference](/wiki/Big_12_Conference \"Big 12 Conference\").\n\n### Les Miles era\n(2001–2004)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Les Miles era \\(2001–2004\\)\")]\n\nAfter Simmons' resignation, a coaching search produced [Dirk\nKoetter](/wiki/Dirk_Koetter \"Dirk Koetter\") as the new head coach.

Miles was hired as head coach while Gundy was brought on as offensive\ncoordinator. In his first year as head coach, Miles would achieve a 4–7\nrecord. In the 2001 regular season finale, the underdog Cowboys would defeat\nthe reigning National Champion Oklahoma Sooners in\n[Norman](/wiki/Norman,_Oklahoma \"Norman, Oklahoma\") 16–13. In 2002, Miles\nwould post a 7–5 regular season record. The Cowboys again defeated the\nOklahoma Sooners, this time in Stillwater. The team would go on to three\nstraight bowl games in Miles's last three years as head coach ('02,'03,'04).\nMiles left after the 2004 season to take the head coaching position at\n[LSU](/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football \"LSU Tigers football\").[17]\n\n### Mike Gundy era\n(2005–present)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Mike Gundy era \\(2005–present\\)\")]\n\n[Mike Gundy](/wiki/Mike_Gundy \"Mike Gundy\") was promoted from offensive\ncoordinator and named immediately as Miles' successor and the 22nd head coach\nat Oklahoma State.

In 2007, the\nCowboys again posted a 6–6 regular season record and a bowl win over the\nIndiana Hoosiers in the [Insight Bowl](/wiki/Insight_Bowl \"Insight Bowl\").\nAfter their second straight bowl appearance, Gundy was rewarded with a\ncontract extension through the 2013 season.\n\nAfter posting a 9–3 regular season record in 2008, Coach Gundy received a new\nseven-year contract worth $15.7 million. The contract, which extends through\nthe 2015 season, was taken into effect on January 1, 2009.[18] Gundy's tenure\nas head coach of the Cowboys has seen the rise and expansion of not only his\nfootball program, but the football facilities as well. The Cowboys began the\n2009 season ranked #9 in the country in the AP Top 25, but the dreams of a\nmiracle season were crushed when the Pokes lost 45–35 to the unranked [Houston\nCougars](/wiki/Houston_Cougars_football \"Houston Cougars football\") at home\nthe following week, and later finding out that star wide receiver Dez Bryant\nwas ruled ineligible for the remainder of the season, for lying to the\n[NCAA](/wiki/NCAA \"NCAA\") about having contact with 8-time pro bowler [Deion\nSanders](/wiki/Deion_Sanders \"Deion Sanders\"), which wasn't an NCAA violation\nin the first place.

The nationally third-ranked\nCowboys eventually went on to win the [Tostitos Fiesta\nBowl](/wiki/Tostitos_Fiesta_Bowl \"Tostitos Fiesta Bowl\") by beating fourth-\nranked [Stanford](/wiki/Stanford \"Stanford\") in overtime, 41–38, on January 2,\n2012.\n\nOn October 29, 2016, Mike Gundy recorded his 100th victory as a head coach\nwith a 37–20 win over # 10 West Virginia. In the process, notching his sixth\nvictory over a top 10 ranked school.

The original\nfootball field was inaugurated in 1913, and the first stand was built in 1920.\nAt that time the field was repositioned from a north-south to an east-west\nconfiguration to avoid the strong prevailing winds of northern Oklahoma. To\nthis day Boone Pickens Stadium is one of a very few major college football\nstadiums with an east-west configuration. By 1930 the capacity had risen to\n13,000 and increased again in 1947. Major additions, including the first press\nbox, brought the capacity to 30,000. In 1950 again seats were added and the\ntotal capacity increased to 39,000. The next renovations came in 1972 and for\nthe next three decades the capacity hovered around 50,000. In 2003 alumnus [T.\nBoone Pickens](/wiki/T._Boone_Pickens \"T.

The announcement\nof the renovation came after two consecutive victories over the Oklahoma\nSooners in the [Bedlam Series](/wiki/Bedlam_Series \"Bedlam Series\"). The\nlatest renovation of the football stadium was completed in 2009, with the\ncurrent capacity at 60,218.\n\nIn 2007, plans to build the [Sherman E. Smith Training\nCenter](/wiki/Sherman_E._Smith_Training_Center \"Sherman E. Smith Training\nCenter\") were unveiled. The 92,000 square foot indoor practice facility was\ncompleted in 2013.[21]\n\n## Current coaching\nstaff[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Current coaching staff\")]\n\nName | Position  \n---|---  \n[Mike Gundy](/wiki/Mike_Gundy \"Mike Gundy\") | Head Coach  \nDan Hammerschmidt | Safeties  \nMike Yurcich | Offensive Coordinator/Quarterbacks Coach  \nGlenn Spencer | Defensive Coordinator/Linebackers Coach  \nJohn Wozniak | Running Backs Coach  \nTim Duffie | Cornerbacks Coach  \nKasey Dunn | Receivers Coach  \nJason McEndoo | Tight Ends/Cowboy Backs Coach  \nJosh Henson | Offensive Line Coach  \nJoe Bob Clements | Defensive Line Coach  \n  \n## Allegations of misconduct by _Sports\nIllustrated_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Allegations of misconduct by Sports Illustrated\")]\n\nOn September 10, 2013, _[Sports Illustrated](/wiki/Sports_Illustrated \"Sports\nIllustrated\")_ published the first of 5 stories alleging misconduct during Les\nMiles tenure and extending into the Mike Gundy era. Writers Thayer Evans and\n[George Dohrmann](/wiki/George_Dohrmann \"George Dohrmann\") reportedly engaged\nin a 10-month-long investigation into wrongdoing throughout the early-mid\n2000s of the Oklahoma State football program. The first installment \"The\nMoney\" made allegations of illicit gifts, overzealous boosters, no-show jobs,\nand a bounty system in place.[22] The second installment, \"The Academics\"\nalleged academic fraud, steering athletes into easy pass or no-show classes,\nand grade tampering. The third installment, \"The Drugs\" painted a picture of a\ndrug culture, in which the players were selling drugs, and the school did\nlittle to curtail drug usage. The fourth installment, \"The Sex\" was heavily\nedited by all accounts, considering its late online release time. This\ninstallment revealed a hostess program where the head coaches oversaw the\napplication process, and writers implied the hostesses were expected to have\nsex with recruits. The final installment \"The Fallout\" told the tale of\nArtrell Woods, who had left school after a horrific accident from which he had\nrecovered.\n\nWhile at first shocking to fans and media, Oklahoma State immediately pledged\ntransparency. Athletic Director Mike Holder held a press conference the day\nbefore the release and apologized for the bad publicity, and promised to\ninvestigate the claims. OSU then hired independent investigator, Charles Smrt\nto conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations. ESPN later debunked\nseveral of the claims in the story by simply calling OSU's registrar and\nobtaining a transcript from [Tatum Bell](/wiki/Tatum_Bell \"Tatum Bell\") that\nproved he was not in school during stated timelines. Further controversy began\nto surround the _Sports Illustrated_ article when [Jason\nWhitlock](/wiki/Jason_Whitlock \"Jason Whitlock\"), a former colleague of Evans,\nclaimed that he was a huge fan of the University of Oklahoma.[23] Dohrmann\nwent on national syndicated radio with [Doug Gottlieb](/wiki/Doug_Gottlieb\n\"Doug Gottlieb\") and stated that Fath' Carter had two degrees from OSU.[24]\nWhen questioned by ESPN's Brett McMurphy, the registrars' office later stated\nthat Fath' Carter had never graduated.[25] [Brandon\nWeeden](/wiki/Brandon_Weeden \"Brandon Weeden\") also was able to point to\nunprofessional behavior from Evans displayed during a press conference.[26]\nDeadSpin also found out that many crucial professors and tutors never were\ninterviewed for the story.[27]\n\nIn June 2014, John Talley, a spokesperson for the\n[FCA](/wiki/Fellowship_of_Christian_Athletes \"Fellowship of Christian\nAthletes\") chapter at Oklahoma State had filed a lawsuit against Dohrmann,\nTime Inc., and Evans for false-light accusations which painted him as an\noverzealous booster.[28] In his lawsuit, Talley is seeking damages of $75,000.\nIn July 2014, OSU confirmed that the NCAA had been investigating the\nallegations.[29]\n\nOn October 21, 2014, the NCAA and The Compliance Group, an independent\ninvestigation firm led by Charles Smrt, jointly released a statement that the\nallegations contained in the Sports Illustrated story were \"fundamentally\nunfounded\". The NCAA and the investigator had pored over 50,000 emails and had\nunfettered access to all areas of the compliance department and re-interviewed\nthose who were quoted in the story. The report stated _\" Overall, several\ninterviewees indicated that they reported to SI general information or\nincidents about college football but that the SI reporter indicated that the\nincident occurred at OSU.\"_ During the joint investigation, however, three\nlesser allegations – not related to the Sports Illustrated claims, and labeled\nas Level II violations- were uncovered\n\n_\" During the period of fall 2007 through the spring of 2013, approximately\n1,572 drug tests occurred of football players. There were 94 positives\ninvolving approximately 60 student-athletes per the policy. (According to the\ncompany used by the University to conduct its drug testing program, this\npositive rate per total number of tests is slightly less than the national\naverage)._\n\nThe institution examined the application of the policy in those 94 situations\nand believes that on four occasions, the applicable penalty per the policy was\nnot applied and reported this information to the Enforcement Staff.\"_[30]_\n\nAlso, it was deemed that the Orange Pride spirit program was chartered under\nthe football program, but a recent NCAA policy change in 2007 required spirit\nclubs to form under the admissions department. Because of these two minor\nviolations, OSU was cited for a failure to monitor in these two instances. The\ntotal cost for the independent investigation amounted to $221,055.18.[31]\n\nOn January 22, 2015, [Burns Hargis](/wiki/Burns_Hargis \"Burns Hargis\") and\nother OSU officials visited the NCAA offices in Indianapolis to appeal to the\nNCAA. Even as Level II allegations, OSU officials considered them harsh and\nsought to have them reduced further. Hargis stated OSU's intent on having\nthose Level II allegations reconsidered, possibly as Level III.\n\nOn April 24, 2015, the NCAA announced the sanctions against Oklahoma State\nwould include an $8,500 fine and one-year probation to avoid further citings.\nThe University self-imposed limits on the number of recruiting visits, off-\ncampus evaluations, and the number of evaluation days in the fall and spring\nrecruiting periods all of which will expire in 2016. The University is also\nnot allowed to use the Orange Pride program to assist with recruiting visits\nfor four years (2019–2020 season).[32] No scholarships were reduced and no\npostseason bans were put into place.[33]\n\n## Logos and\nuniforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Logos and uniforms\")]\n\nThroughout the 2000s, the Cowboys had four main uniform combinations. For the\n2011 football season, it was revealed that Nike had created new uniforms for\nthe Cowboys, offering three different helmet options in either gray, black, or\nwhite. New jerseys and pants consisting of black, orange, grey and white also\ncame aboard, allowing for up to 48 different variations. The Cowboys debuted\ntheir new gray uniforms for the first game of the 2011 season. In a 2012 home\ngame against Iowa State, the Cowboys debuted the new orange helmets, along\nwith a new Pistol Pete decal. This would bring the different uniform\ncombinations up to 64.[34]\n\nThe uniform combinations are chosen before the season by a committee of\nplayers and the Cowboys equipment manager, Wes Edwards. A few patterns have\nevolved since the origination of the multiple uniform era. Thursday night\ngames during 2009, 2010, 2011, and in 2014 have involved black uniforms.\nAnother trend has the Cowboys reverting to the traditional White\nHelmet/Traditional Brand Logo/Orange Jersey/White Pants for the home opener in\n2012, 2013, and 2014. Bowl games for the [2012 Fiesta\nBowl](/wiki/2012_Fiesta_Bowl \"2012 Fiesta Bowl\"), the [2013 Heart of Dallas\nBowl](/wiki/2013_Heart_of_Dallas_Bowl \"2013 Heart of Dallas Bowl\"), and the\nhigh-profile 2014 season opener in the [Cowboys Classic](/wiki/Cowboys_Classic\n\"Cowboys Classic\") featured Oklahoma State wearing all black.\n\nDuring the 2012 season, fans saw the addition of the orange helmet, and the\naddition of new decals. For the first time since 1979, the Cowboys took the\nfield in \"All Orange\" against Iowa State for Homecoming. Also during the 2012\nseason, new carbon fiber gray helmets replaced the matte gray that had been\nused in 2011.\n\nThe Cowboys helmet logos include a Pistol Pete logo, as well as what fans\nrefer to as \"Phantom Pete\". The \"OSU\" Branded logo was now featured in\ndifferent variants, to reflect the helmet being worn. During 2013, OSU began\nincorporating a stripe down the center of their helmets for different\nvariations. In 2014, OSU revealed two new helmet choices- a \"classic Aggie\"\nwhich paid homage to the bucking Aggie logo used in the 1940s and 1950s when\nthe school was still called Oklahoma A&M Aggies. The other helmet was an\nOrange-Chrome with an oversized, off-center Pistol Pete. This was worn in a\nThursday night victory over Texas Tech.\n\n### Past\nuniforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Past uniforms\")]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/Big12-Uniform-OSU-2010.png/120px-Big12-Uniform-OSU-2010.png)](/wiki/File:Big12-Uniform-OSU-2010.png)\n\nOklahoma State's Uniforms for 2010 Season\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/2011_Gray_Black_Gray.jpg/56px-2011_Gray_Black_Gray.jpg)](/wiki/File:2011_Gray_Black_Gray.jpg)\n\n2011 Season Opener Combination\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/2012_Carbon_Fiber.jpg/120px-2012_Carbon_Fiber.jpg)](/wiki/File:2012_Carbon_Fiber.jpg)\n\nCarbon Fiber Helmet\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/2014_Classic_Aggie.jpg/120px-2014_Classic_Aggie.jpg)](/wiki/File:2014_Classic_Aggie.jpg)\n\n2014 Bucking Aggie Logo\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/2014_Orange_Chrome.jpg/96px-2014_Orange_Chrome.jpg)](/wiki/File:2014_Orange_Chrome.jpg)\n\n2014 Orange Chrome Pete\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/2012_All_Orange.jpg/61px-2012_All_Orange.jpg)](/wiki/File:2012_All_Orange.jpg)\n\n2012 Oklahoma State Uniform\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/2013_Phantom_Pete_White.jpg/120px-2013_Phantom_Pete_White.jpg)](/wiki/File:2013_Phantom_Pete_White.jpg)\n\n2013 Oklahoma State Uniform\n\n## Paddle\npeople[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Paddle people\")]\n\nThe student section has a tradition of hitting orange paddles on the sideline\nwall at home games.

It was a\ncold, and very windy day with the temperatures well below the freezing mark.\nAt one moment in the game when the Oklahoma A&M Aggies were punting, the wind\ncarried the ball backwards behind the kicker. If the Oklahoma A&M squad\nrecovered the ball it would be a touchback and if the University of Oklahoma\nsquad recovered it, it would be a touchdown. The ball kept going backwards and\nrolled down a hill into the half-frozen creek. Since a touchdown was at stake,\nmembers of both teams dove into the icy waters to recover the ball. A member\nof the OU team came out with the ball and downed it for a touchdown,\neventually winning the game 75–0.[2] Thus was the beginning of Bedlam.\n\nAuthor Steve Budin, whose father was a New York bookie, has recently\npublicized the claim that the 1954 [\"Bedlam\" game](/wiki/Bedlam_Series \"Bedlam\nSeries\") against rival [OU](/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_football \"Oklahoma Sooners\nfootball\") was fixed by mobsters in his book _Bets, Drugs, and Rock & Roll_\n([ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number_\\(identifier\\) \"International\nStandard Book Number \\(identifier\\)\")\n[1-60239-099-1](/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-60239-099-1\n\"Special:BookSources/1-60239-099-1\")).[35] Allegedly, the mobsters threatened\nand paid off a cook to slip laxatives into a soup eaten by many OU Sooner\nstarting players, causing them to fall violently ill in the days leading up to\nthe game. OU was victorious in the end, but their 14–0 win did not cover the\n20-point spread they had in their favor. However, many people involved in the\n1954 contest do not recall any incident like the one purported by Budin to\nhave occurred.[36] The University of Oklahoma leads the Bedlam Series in\nfootball 86–18–7 after claiming their 10th Big XII Conference Championship\n38–20 against Oklahoma State on Dec 3, 2016.\n\n###\nTulsa[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Tulsa\")]\n\nMain article: [Oklahoma State-Tulsa football rivalry](/wiki/Oklahoma_State-\nTulsa_football_rivalry \"Oklahoma State-Tulsa football rivalry\")\n\nThe Cowboys also have a rivalry with\n[Tulsa](/wiki/Tulsa_Golden_Hurricane_football \"Tulsa Golden Hurricane\nfootball\"). Oklahoma State leads Tulsa in the all-time series 40–27–5, winning\nthe most recent match up in 2017, 59–24.[37] Since 1990 Tulsa is 3–9 versus\nOklahoma State with the Cowboys scoring at least 36 points in each of the last\nfour contests.
