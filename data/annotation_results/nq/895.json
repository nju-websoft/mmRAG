Two-thirds of the 7.4-acre (30,000 m2)\nsite is landscaping and water. Each pillar is inscribed with the name of one\nof the 48 [U.S. states](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S. state\") of 1945, as well as the\n[District of Columbia](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\"), the [Alaska\nTerritory](/wiki/Alaska_Territory \"Alaska Territory\") and [Territory of\nHawaii](/wiki/Territory_of_Hawaii \"Territory of Hawaii\"), the [Commonwealth of\nthe Philippines](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines \"Commonwealth of the\nPhilippines\"), [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto Rico\"),\n[Guam](/wiki/Guam \"Guam\"), [American Samoa](/wiki/American_Samoa \"American\nSamoa\"), and the [U.S. Virgin Islands](/wiki/U.S._Virgin_Islands \"U.S. Virgin\nIslands\"). The northern arch is inscribed with\n\"[Atlantic](/wiki/European_Theatre_of_World_War_II \"European Theatre of World\nWar II\")\"; the southern one, \"[Pacific](/wiki/Asiatic-Pacific_Theater\n\"Asiatic-Pacific Theater\").\" The plaza is 337 ft 10 in (102.97 m) long and 240\nfeet 2 inches (73.20 m) wide, is sunk 6 feet (1.8 m) below\n[grade](/wiki/Grade_\\(slope\\) \"Grade \\(slope\\)\"), and contains a pool that is\n246 feet 9 inches by 147 feet 8 inches (75.2 × 45.0 m).[5]\n\nThe memorial includes two[6] inconspicuously located \"[Kilroy was\nhere](/wiki/Kilroy_was_here \"Kilroy was here\")\" engravings. Their inclusion in\nthe memorial acknowledges the significance of the symbol to American soldiers\nduring World War II and how it represented their presence and protection\nwherever it was inscribed.[7]\n\nOn approaching the semicircle from the east, a visitor walks along one of two\nwalls (right side wall and left side wall) picturing scenes of the war\nexperience in bas relief. As one approaches on the left (toward the Pacific\narch), the scenes begin with soon-to-be servicemen getting physical exams,\ntaking the oath, and being issued military gear. The reliefs progress through\nseveral iconic scenes, including combat and burying the dead, ending in a\nhomecoming scene. On the right-side wall (toward the Atlantic arch) there is a\nsimilar progression, but with scenes generally more typical of the European\ntheatre. Some scenes take place in England, depicting the preparations for air\nand sea assaults. The last scene is of [a handshake between the American and\nRussian armies](/wiki/Elbe_Day \"Elbe Day\") when the western and eastern fronts\nmet in Germany.\n\n### Freedom\nWall[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Freedom Wall\")]\n\nThe Freedom Wall is on the west side of the memorial, with a view of the\n[Reflecting Pool](/wiki/Reflecting_Pool \"Reflecting Pool\") and Lincoln\nMemorial behind it.

In front of the wall lies the message \"Here we\nmark the price of freedom\".[8]\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Natww2.jpg/170px-\nNatww2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Natww2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Natww2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nView of The World War II Memorial (bottom) and the Lincoln Memorial (top) from\nthe Washington Monument\n\nIn 1987, World War II veteran Roger Durbin approached Representative [Marcy\nKaptur](/wiki/Marcy_Kaptur \"Marcy Kaptur\"), a\n[Democrat](/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party \"United States Democratic\nParty\") from [Ohio](/wiki/Ohio \"Ohio\"), to ask if a World War II memorial\ncould be constructed. Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act to the\n[House of Representatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"United States House of Representatives\") as HR 3742 on December 10. The\nresolution authorized the [American Battle Monuments\nCommission](/wiki/American_Battle_Monuments_Commission \"American Battle\nMonuments Commission\") (ABMC) to establish a World War II memorial in\n\"Washington, D.C., or its environs\", but the bill was not voted on before the\nend of the session, so it was not passed. Two more times, in 1989 and 1991,\nRep. Kaptur introduced similar legislation, but these bills suffered the same\nfate as the first, and did not become law.\n\nKaptur reintroduced legislation in the House a fourth time as HR 682 on\nJanuary 27, 1993, one day after Senator [Strom Thurmond](/wiki/Strom_Thurmond\n\"Strom Thurmond\") (a [Republican](/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party \"United\nStates Republican Party\") from [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South\nCarolina\")) introduced companion Senate legislation. On March 17, 1993, the\nSenate approved the act, and the House approved an amended version of the bill\non May 4. On May 12, the Senate also approved the amended bill, and the World\nWar II Memorial Act was signed into law by President [Bill\nClinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\") on May 25 of that year, becoming\nPublic Law 103-32.\n\n###\nFundraising[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Fundraising\")]\n\nOn September 30, 1994, President [Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill\nClinton\") appointed a 12-member Memorial Advisory Board (MAB) to advise the\nABMC in picking the site, designing the memorial, and raising money to build\nit. A [direct mail](/wiki/Direct_mail \"Direct mail\") fundraising effort\nbrought in millions of dollars from individual Americans. Additional large\ndonations were made by veterans' groups, including the [American\nLegion](/wiki/American_Legion \"American Legion\"), the [Veterans of Foreign\nWars](/wiki/Veterans_of_Foreign_Wars \"Veterans of Foreign Wars\"), Veterans of\nthe Battle of the Bulge and others. The majority of the corporate fundraising\neffort was led by two co-chairs: Senator [Bob Dole](/wiki/Bob_Dole \"Bob\nDole\"), a decorated World War II veteran and 1996 Republican nominee for\npresident; and [Frederick W. Smith](/wiki/Frederick_W._Smith \"Frederick W.\nSmith\"), the [president](/wiki/President \"President\") and [chief executive\nofficer](/wiki/Chief_executive_officer \"Chief executive officer\") of [FedEx\nCorporation](/wiki/FedEx_Corporation \"FedEx Corporation\") and a former [U.S.\nMarine Corps](/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps \"United States Marine Corps\")\nofficer. The [U.S. federal\ngovernment](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal government\nof the United States\") provided about $16 million. A total of $197 million was\nraised.\n\n### Picking the\nsite[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Picking the site\")]\n\nOn January 20, 1995, Colonel Kevin C. Kelley, project manager for the ABMC,\norganized the first meeting of the ABMC and the MAB, at which the project was\ndiscussed and initial plans made. The meeting was chaired by Commissioner F.\nHaydn Williams, chairman of ABMC's World War II Memorial Site and Design\nCommittee, who would go on to guide the project through the site selection and\napproval process and the selection and approval of the Memorial's design.\nRepresentatives from the [United States Commission of Fine\nArts](/wiki/United_States_Commission_of_Fine_Arts \"United States Commission of\nFine Arts\"), the [National Capital Planning\nCommission](/wiki/National_Capital_Planning_Commission \"National Capital\nPlanning Commission\"), the [National Capital Memorial\nCommission](/wiki/National_Capital_Memorial_Commission \"National Capital\nMemorial Commission\"), the [U.S. Army Corps of\nEngineers](/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers \"United States Army\nCorps of Engineers\"), and the National Park Service attended the meeting.\nSelection of an appropriate site was taken on as the first action.\n\nOver the next months, several sites were considered. Three quickly gained\nfavor:[9][10]\n\n  * [U.S. Capitol](/wiki/United_States_Capitol \"United States Capitol\") [Reflection Pool](/wiki/Capitol_Reflection_Pool \"Capitol Reflection Pool\") area – between 3rd Street and the [Ulysses S. Grant Memorial](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant_Memorial \"Ulysses S.

The\ndesign would incorporate the Rainbow Pool fountain, located across 17th Street\nfrom the Washington Monument and near the Constitution Gardens site.[11]\n\nThe location is itself a significant symbol. The memorial will be given a more\nprominent spot than any monument on the National Mall since the Lincoln\nMemorial opened in 1922. The location, between the Washington Monument and the\nLincoln Memorial, represents the first addition in more than 70 years to the\ngrand corridor of open space that stretches from the Capitol 2.1 miles west to\nthe Potomac River.[12]\n\n### Designing the\nmemorial[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Designing the memorial\")]\n\nA nationwide design competition drew 400 submissions from architects from\naround the country. [Friedrich St. Florian](/wiki/Friedrich_St._Florian\n\"Friedrich St. Florian\")'s initial design was selected in 1997. Over the next\nfour years, St. Florian's design was altered during the review and approval\nprocess required of proposed memorials in Washington, D.C. Ambassador Haydn\nWilliams guided the design development for ABMC.\n\nSt. Florian's design consists of an architectural sculpture that evokes a\nclassical monument. The two memorial arches, Pacific and Atlantic baldacchinos\neach have laurel wreaths suspended in the air with 4 eagles carrying it. The\nchandelier sculpture symbolizes the victory of the War with the Nation's bird\ncarrying a Grecian symbol of victory but with an American adaptation of oak\nlaurel wreaths to symbolize strength.\n\nEach of the 56 pillars all consists of oak laurel wreaths and wheat laurel\nwreath. The oak symbolizes military and industrial strength and the wheat\nsymbolizes agricultural and breadbasket during the U.S. part in the war.\n\n##\nConstruction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Construction\")]\n\nGround was broken in September 2001. The construction was managed by the\n[General Services Administration](/wiki/General_Services_Administration\n\"General Services Administration\").\n\nThe triumphal arches were crafted by [Rock of Ages\nCorporation](/wiki/Rock_of_Ages_Corporation \"Rock of Ages Corporation\").\nSculptor [Raymond Kaskey](/wiki/Raymond_Kaskey \"Raymond Kaskey\") created the\nbronze eagles and wreaths that were installed under the arches, as well as 24\nbronze [bas-relief](/wiki/Bas-relief \"Bas-relief\") panels that depict wartime\nscenes of combat and the home front.[13] The bronzes were cast over the course\nof two and a half years at Laran Bronze in [Chester,\nPennsylvania](/wiki/Chester,_Pennsylvania \"Chester, Pennsylvania\").[14] The\nstainless-steel armature that holds up the eagles and wreaths was designed at\nLaran, in part by sculptor [James Peniston](/wiki/James_Peniston \"James\nPeniston\"),[15] and fabricated by Apex Piping of [Newport,\nDelaware](/wiki/Newport,_Delaware \"Newport, Delaware\").[16]\n\n[The John Stevens Shop](/wiki/The_John_Stevens_Shop \"The John Stevens Shop\")\ndesigned the lettering for the memorial and most of the inscriptions were\nhand-carved in situ.\n\nThe memorial opened to the public on April 29, 2004, and was dedicated in a\nMay 29 ceremony attended by thousands of people. The memorial became a\n[national park](/wiki/National_park \"National park\") on November 1, when\nauthority over it was transferred to the National Park Service.\n\nIn 2012, the memorial's fountain was renovated.[17]\n\n  * The memorial under construction in August 2002\n  * [![Washington Monument August 2002 02.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Washington_Monument_August_2002_02.jpg/198px-Washington_Monument_August_2002_02.jpg)](/wiki/File:Washington_Monument_August_2002_02.jpg)\n\n  * [![WWII memorial construction.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/WWII_memorial_construction.jpg/235px-WWII_memorial_construction.jpg)](/wiki/File:WWII_memorial_construction.jpg)\n\n  * [![Washington DC August 2002 03.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Washington_DC_August_2002_03.jpg/198px-Washington_DC_August_2002_03.jpg)](/wiki/File:Washington_DC_August_2002_03.jpg)\n\n##\nControversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Controversy\")]\n\n### Criticism of the\nlocation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Criticism of the location\")]\n\nCritics such as the National Coalition to Save Our Mall opposed the location\nof the memorial. A major criticism of the location was that it would interrupt\nwhat had been an unbroken view between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln\nMemorial. The memorial was also criticized for taking up open space that had\nbeen historically used for major\n[demonstrations](/wiki/Demonstration_\\(people\\) \"Demonstration \\(people\\)\")\nand [protests](/wiki/Protest \"Protest\").[18][19][20]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Washington_Monument_View.jpg/220px-\nWashington_Monument_View.jpg)](/wiki/File:Washington_Monument_View.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Washington_Monument_View.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWashington Monument View\n\nCritics were particularly bothered by the expedited approval process, which is\nconsiderably lengthy most of the time.[21] The United States Congress, worried\nthat World War II veterans were dying before an appropriate memorial could be\nbuilt, passed legislation exempting the World War II Memorial from further\nsite and design review. Congress also dismissed pending legal challenges to\nthe memorial.[22]\n\n### Criticism of the design and\nstyle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Criticism of the design and style\")]\n\nThere were also aesthetic objections to the design. A critic from the _[Boston\nHerald](/wiki/Boston_Herald \"Boston Herald\")_ described the monument as\n\"vainglorious, demanding of attention and full of trite imagery.\"[23] _[The\nPhiladelphia Inquirer](/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Inquirer \"The Philadelphia\nInquirer\")_ argued that \"this pompous style was also favored by\n[Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler \"Adolf Hitler\") and\n[Mussolini](/wiki/Benito_Mussolini \"Benito Mussolini\")\"[24] (see [Nazi\narchitecture](/wiki/Nazi_architecture \"Nazi architecture\")). The _[Washington\nPost](/wiki/Washington_Post \"Washington Post\")_ described it as \"overbearing\",\n\"bombastic\", and a \"hodgepodge of cliche and Soviet-style pomposity\" with \"the\nemotional impact of a slab of granite\".[25]\n\nSome supporters said that the design evoked federal architecture during the\n[New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\") period, influenced by an austere\ninterpretation of [Art Deco](/wiki/Art_Deco \"Art Deco\")/[Beaux\nArts](/wiki/Beaux-Arts_architecture \"Beaux-Arts architecture\")\nstyles.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] This view, and the monument, were dismissed by one prominent\narchitecture critic as \"knee-jerk [historicism](/wiki/Historicism_\\(art\\)\n\"Historicism \\(art\\)\")\"[26]\n\n### FDR's D-Day\nprayer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=National_World_War_II_Memorial&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: FDR's D-Day prayer\")]\n\nOn May 23, 2013, Senator [Rob Portman](/wiki/Rob_Portman \"Rob Portman\")\nintroduced the [World War II Memorial Prayer Act of 2013 (S. 1044; 113th\nCongress)](/wiki/World_War_II_Memorial_Prayer_Act_of_2013_\\(S._1044;_113th_Congress\\)\n\"World War II Memorial Prayer Act of 2013 \\(S. 1044; 113th Congress\\)\"), a\nbill that would direct the [United States Secretary of the\nInterior](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Interior \"United States\nSecretary of the Interior\") to install at the World War II memorial in the\n[District of Columbia](/wiki/District_of_Columbia \"District of Columbia\") a\nsuitable plaque or an inscription with the words that President [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\") prayed with\nthe United States on June 6, 1944, the morning of [D-Day](/wiki/D-Day\n\"D-Day\").[27] The bill was opposed by the [American Civil

United for Separation of Church and\nState](/wiki/Americans_United_for_Separation_of_Church_and_State \"Americans\nUnited for Separation of Church and State\"), the [Hindu American\nFoundation](/wiki/Hindu_American_Foundation \"Hindu American Foundation\"), and\nthe [Interfaith Alliance](/wiki/Interfaith_Alliance \"Interfaith\nAlliance\").[28] Together the organizations argued that the bill \"endorses the\nfalse notion that all veterans will be honored by a war memorial that includes\na prayer proponents characterize as reflecting our country's 'Judeo-Christian\nheritage and values.'\"[28] The organizations argued that \"the memorial, as it\ncurrently stands, appropriately honors those who served and encompasses the\nentirety of the war\" and was carefully created, so no additional elements,\nsuch as FDR's prayer, need to be added.[28] But, they said, \"the effect of\nthis bill, however, is to co-opt religion for political purposes,
