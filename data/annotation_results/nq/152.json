These five cities, also known as the \"cities of\nthe plain\" (from Genesis in the [Authorized Version](/wiki/Authorized_Version\n\"Authorized Version\")), were situated on the [Jordan River](/wiki/River_Jordan\n\"River Jordan\") plain in the southern region of the land of\n[Canaan](/wiki/Canaan \"Canaan\"). The plain, which corresponds to the area just\nnorth of the modern-day [Dead Sea](/wiki/Dead_Sea \"Dead Sea\"),[5] was compared\nto the garden of\nEden[[Gen.13:10]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+13%3A10&version=NIV)\nas being well-watered and green, suitable for grazing livestock.\n\n[Divine judgment](/wiki/Divine_judgment \"Divine judgment\") by [God](/wiki/God\n\"God\") was passed upon Sodom and Gomorrah and two neighboring cities, which\nwere completely consumed by [fire and brimstone](/wiki/Fire_and_brimstone\n\"Fire and brimstone\"). Neighboring [Zoar](/wiki/Zoara \"Zoara\") (Bela) was the\nonly city to be spared. In [Abrahamic religions](/wiki/Abrahamic_religions\n\"Abrahamic religions\"), Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with\nimpenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of [divine\nretribution](/wiki/Divine_retribution \"Divine retribution\").[6][7][[Jude\n1:7]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude+1%3A7&version=NRSV)\nSodom and Gomorrah have been used historically and today as\n[metaphors](/wiki/Metaphor \"Metaphor\") for [vice](/wiki/Vice \"Vice\") and\n[homosexuality](/wiki/Homosexuality \"Homosexuality\"), although a close reading\nof the text and other Ancient Near Eastern sources suggest that this\nassociation may be incorrect.[8]\n\nThe story has therefore given rise to words in several languages. These\ninclude the English word _[sodomy](/wiki/Sodomy \"Sodomy\")_ , which is used in\n[sodomy laws](/wiki/Sodomy_law \"Sodomy law\") to describe sexual \"crimes\nagainst nature\", namely [anal](/wiki/Anal_sex \"Anal sex\") or [oral\nsex](/wiki/Oral_sex \"Oral sex\") (particularly [homosexual](/wiki/Homosexual\n\"Homosexual\")), or [bestiality](/wiki/Bestiality \"Bestiality\").[9][10][11]\nSome Islamic societies incorporate punishments associated with Sodom and\nGomorrah into [sharia](/wiki/Sharia \"Sharia\").[12]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Etymology\n  * 2 Historicity\n  * 3 In the Book of Genesis\n    * 3.1 Battle of Siddim\n    * 3.2 The Judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah\n  * 4 Other references\n    * 4.1 Moses\n    * 4.2 Major Prophets\n    * 4.3 Minor Prophets\n    * 4.4 New Testament\n    * 4.5 Deuterocanonical references\n  * 5 Religious views\n    * 5.1 Jewish\n    * 5.2 Christian\n    * 5.3 Islamic\n  * 6 Modern Sodom\n  * 7 Second World War\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nEtymology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sodom_and_Gomorrah&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Etymology\")]\n\nThe etymology of both names is uncertain.[13] The exact original meanings of\nthe names are also uncertain. Some believe, the name _Sodom_\n([Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\"): סְדֹם‎ _Səḏōm_) could be a\nword from an early Semitic language ultimately related to the Arabic _sadama_\n, meaning \"fasten\", \"fortify\", \"strengthen\", but that is unlikely as the\nGesenius' Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon defines the hebrew word Sodom (Cēdom) as\nburning.[14] Gomorrah ([Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\"):\nעֲמֹרָה‎ _‘Ămōrāh_) could be based on the root _gh m r_ , which means \"be\ndeep\", \"copious (water),\"[15] but this is also in dispute as it is classically\nknown as עֲמֹרָה ʻĂmôrâh, am-o-raw'; from H6014; a (ruined) heap; Amorah, a\nplace in Palestine:—Gomorrah.[16]\n\n##\nHistoricity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sodom_and_Gomorrah&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Historicity\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Pillar_of_salt_at_Usdum.jpg/220px-\nPillar_of_salt_at_Usdum.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pillar_of_salt_at_Usdum.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pillar_of_salt_at_Usdum.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPainting from [William Francis Lynch](/wiki/William_Francis_Lynch \"William\nFrancis Lynch\") book _The Narrative of the United States Expedition of the\nRiver Jordan and the Dead Sea_. Published in 1849\n\nThere are other stories and historical names which bear a resemblance to the\nBiblical stories of Sodom and Gomorrah. Some possible natural explanations for\nthe events described have been proposed, but no widely accepted or strongly\nverified sites for the cities have been found. Of the five \"cities of the\nplain\", only Bela, modern-day [Zoara](/wiki/Zoara \"Zoara\"), is securely\nidentified, and it remained a settlement long after the biblical period.\n\nThe ancient Greek historiographer [Strabo](/wiki/Strabo \"Strabo\") states that\nlocals living near Moasada (as opposed to [Masada](/wiki/Masada \"Masada\")) say\nthat \"there were once thirteen inhabited cities in that region of which Sodom\nwas the metropolis\". Strabo identifies [a limestone and salt\nhill](/wiki/Mount_Sodom \"Mount Sodom\") at the south western tip of the Dead\nSea, and [Kharbet Usdum](/wiki/Mount_Sodom \"Mount Sodom\") (Hebrew: הר סדום,\n_Har Sedom_ or Arabic: جبل السدوم, _Jabal(u) 'ssudūm_) ruins nearby as the\nsite of biblical Sodom.[17] [Archibald Sayce](/wiki/Archibald_Sayce \"Archibald\nSayce\") translated an [Akkadian](/wiki/Akkadian_language \"Akkadian language\")\npoem describing cities that were destroyed in a rain of fire, written from the\nview of a person who escaped the destruction; the names of the cities are not\ngiven.[18] However, Sayce later mentions that the story more closely resembles\nthe doom of [Sennacherib](/wiki/Sennacherib \"Sennacherib\")'s host.[19]\n\nIn 1976 [Giovanni Pettinato](/wiki/Giovanni_Pettinato \"Giovanni Pettinato\")\nclaimed that a [cuneiform](/wiki/Cuneiform \"Cuneiform\") tablet that had been\nfound in the newly discovered library at [Ebla](/wiki/Ebla \"Ebla\") contained\nthe names of all five of the cities of the plain (Sodom, Gomorrah,\n[Admah](/wiki/Admah \"Admah\"), [Zeboim](/wiki/Zeboim_\\(Hebrew_Bible\\) \"Zeboim\n\\(Hebrew Bible\\)\"), and [Bela](/wiki/Zoara \"Zoara\")), listed in the same order\nas in Genesis. The names _si-da-mu_ [TM.76.G.524] and _ì-ma-ar_ [TM.75.G.1570\nand TM.75.G.2233] were identified as representing Sodom and Gomorrah, which\ngained some acceptance at the time.[20] However, Alfonso Archi states that,\njudging from the surrounding city names in the cuneiform list, _si-da-mu_ lies\nin northern Syria and not near the Dead Sea, and _ì-ma-ar_ is a variant of _ì-\nmar_ , known to represent [Emar](/wiki/Emar \"Emar\"), an ancient city located\nnear Ebla.[21] Today, the scholarly consensus is that \"Ebla has no bearing on\n... Sodom and Gomorra.\"[22]\n\nCertain skeptics of the biblical account have theorized that, provided that\nthe cities existed at all, that they might have been destroyed by [natural\ndisaster](/wiki/Natural_disaster \"Natural disaster\"). One such idea is that\nthe Dead Sea was devastated by an [earthquake](/wiki/Earthquake \"Earthquake\")\nbetween 2100 and 1900 BCE. This might have unleashed showers of steaming\ntar.[23] It is possible that the towns were destroyed by an earthquake,\nespecially if they lay along a major fault such as the [Jordan Rift\nValley](/wiki/Jordan_Rift_Valley \"Jordan Rift Valley\"). There is a lack of\ncontemporary accounts of seismic activity within the necessary timeframe,\nhowever, to corroborate this theory.[24] Another idea is that the destruction\nwas caused by the plume of a [meteor](/wiki/Meteor \"Meteor\") that impacted in\nthe Alps, as possibly shown in a [planisphere](/wiki/Planisphere\n\"Planisphere\") inscribed on a cuneiform tablet. [25]\n\nIn 1973, Walter E. Rast and R. Thomas Schaub discovered or visited a number of\npossible sites of the cities, including [Bab edh-Dhra](/wiki/Bab_edh-Dhra \"Bab\nedh-Dhra\"), which was originally excavated in 1965 by archaeologist Paul Lapp,\nand later finished by Rast and Schaub following his death. Other possibilities\ninclude [Numeira](/wiki/Numeira \"Numeira\"), al-Safi, Feifa, and\n[Khanazir](/wiki/Khanazir \"Khanazir\"), which were also visited by Schaub and\nRast. Each of the sites were near the [Dead Sea](/wiki/Dead_Sea \"Dead Sea\")\nand showed evidence of burning and traces of [sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur\n\"Sulfur\").[26][27] According to Schaub, however, who dug at Bab edh-Dhra,\nNumeira was destroyed in 2600 BCE at a different time period than Bab edh-Dhra\n(2350–2067 BCE).[28] Archaeological remains excavated from Bab edh-Dhra are\ncurrently displayed in [Karak Archaeological\nMuseum](/wiki/Karak_Archaeological_Museum \"Karak Archaeological Museum\")\n(Karak Castle), [Amman Citadel](/wiki/Amman_Citadel \"Amman Citadel\") Museum,\nand the [British Museum](/wiki/British_Museum \"British Museum\").\n\nAnother candidate for Sodom is the [Tall el Hammam](/wiki/Tall_el-\nHammam_Excavation_Project \"Tall el-Hammam Excavation Project\") dig site which\nbegan in 2006 under the direction of [Steven\nCollins](/wiki/Steven_Collins_\\(archaeologist\\) \"Steven Collins\n\\(archaeologist\\)\"). Tall el Hammam is located in the southern Jordan river\nvalley approximately 14 kilometres (9 mi) northeast of the Dead Sea, and\naccording to Collins fits the biblical descriptions of the lands of\nSodom.[29][30] The ongoing dig is a result of joint cooperation between\n[Trinity Southwest University](/wiki/Trinity_Southwest_University \"Trinity\nSouthwest University\") and the Department of Antiquities of the [Hashemite\nKingdom of Jordan](/wiki/Hashemite_Kingdom_of_Jordan \"Hashemite Kingdom of\nJordan\").[31][_[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS\n\"Wikipedia:NOTRS\")_]\n\nProfessor [Eugene H. Merrill](/wiki/Eugene_H._Merrill_\\(academic\\) \"Eugene H.\nMerrill \\(academic\\)\") believes that the identification of Tall el-Hammam with\nSodom would require an unacceptable restructuring of the biblical\nchronology.[32][33][34]\n\nThe Jewish historian [Josephus](/wiki/Josephus \"Josephus\") identifies the\n[Dead Sea](/wiki/Dead_Sea \"Dead Sea\") in geographic proximity to the ancient\nbiblical city of Sodom. He refers to the lake by its Greek name,\nAsphaltites.[35]\n\n## In the Book of\nGenesis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sodom_and_Gomorrah&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: In the Book of Genesis\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

Sodom and Gomorrah's political situation is\ndescribed when [Lot](/wiki/Lot_\\(biblical_person\\) \"Lot \\(biblical person\\)\")\nhad encamped in Sodom's territory. At this time, \"the men of Sodom [were]\nwicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly\". Sodom was ruled by King\n[Bera](/wiki/Bera_\\(Bible\\) \"Bera \\(Bible\\)\") while Gomorrah was ruled by King\n[Birsha](/wiki/Birsha \"Birsha\"). Their kingship, however, was not sovereign,\nbecause all of the river Jordan plain was under [Elamite](/wiki/Elam \"Elam\")\nrule for 12 years. The kingdom of Elam was ruled by King\n[Chedorlaomer](/wiki/Chedorlaomer \"Chedorlaomer\"). In the 13th year of\nsubjugation to Elam, the five kings of the river Jordan plain allied to rebel\nagainst Elamite rule. These kings included those of Sodom and Gomorrah as well\nas their neighbors: King [Shinab](/wiki/Shinab \"Shinab\") of\n[Admah](/wiki/Admah \"Admah\"), King [Shemeber](/wiki/Shemeber \"Shemeber\") of\n[Zeboiim](/wiki/Zeboyim \"Zeboyim\"), and the unnamed king of [Bela](/wiki/Zoara\n\"Zoara\") (later called Zoar).\n\nIn response, Elam's King [Chedorlaomer](/wiki/Chedorlaomer \"Chedorlaomer\"),\ngathered additional forces from [Shinar](/wiki/Shinar \"Shinar\"),\n[Ellasar](/wiki/Ellasar \"Ellasar\") and [Goyim](/wiki/Goyim \"Goyim\") to\nsuppress this rebellion from the cities of the plain. They waged war in the\n[Vale of Siddim](/wiki/Battle_of_Siddim \"Battle of Siddim\") in the 14th year.\nThe battle was brutal with heavy losses in the cities of the plain, with their\nresultant defeat, [Genesis 14:10](http://www.mechon-\nmamre.org/p/pt/pt0114.htm#10). Sodom and Gomorrah were spoiled of their goods,\nand captives were taken, including Lot. The tide of war turned when Lot's\nuncle, [Abraham](/wiki/Abraham \"Abraham\"), gathered an elite force that\nslaughtered King Chedorlaomer's forces in Hobah, north of\n[Damascus](/wiki/Damascus \"Damascus\"). The success of his mission freed the\ncities of the plain from under Elam's rule.\n\n### The Judgment upon Sodom and\nGomorrah[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sodom_and_Gomorrah&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: The Judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah\")]\n\nSee also: [Hospitality § Judaism](/wiki/Hospitality#Judaism \"Hospitality\")\n\nThe story of the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah is told in [Genesis\n18-19](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm#1). Three men, thought by\nmost commentators to have been angels appearing as men,[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] came to\nAbraham in the plains of Mamre. After the angels received the hospitality of\nAbraham and Sarah, his wife, \"the Lord\" revealed to Abraham that he would\nconfirm what he had heard against Sodom and Gomorrah, \"and because their sin\nis very grievous\".\n\nIn response, Abraham inquired of the Lord if he would spare the city if 50\nrighteous people were found in it, to which the Lord agreed he would not\ndestroy it for the sake of the righteous yet dwelling therein. Abraham then\ninquired of God for mercy at lower numbers (first 45, then 40, then 30, then\n20, and finally at 10), with the Lord agreeing each time.[36] Two angels were\nsent to Sodom to investigate and were met by Abraham's nephew\n[Lot](/wiki/Lot_\\(biblical_person\\) \"Lot \\(biblical person\\)\"), who convinced\nthe angels to lodge with him, and they ate with Lot.\n\n[Genesis 19:4-5](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0119.htm#4) described what\nfollowed, which confirmed its end:\n\n> 4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,\n> compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every\n> quarter.  \n>  5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him: 'Where are the men that came\n> in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.'\n>\n> ([NRSV](/wiki/New_Revised_Standard_Version \"New Revised Standard Version\"):\n> know them, [NIV](/wiki/New_International_Version \"New International\n> Version\"): can have sex with them, [NJB](/wiki/New_Jerusalem_Bible \"New\n> Jerusalem Bible\"): can have intercourse with them).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Nuremberg_chronicles_f_21r.png/220px-\nNuremberg_chronicles_f_21r.png)](/wiki/File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_21r.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_21r.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSodom and Gomorrah from the [Nuremberg Chronicle](/wiki/Nuremberg_Chronicle\n\"Nuremberg Chronicle\") by [Hartmann Schedel](/wiki/Hartmann_Schedel \"Hartmann\nSchedel\"), 1493. [Lot's wife](/wiki/Lot%27s_wife \"Lot's wife\"), already\ntransformed into a salt pillar, is in the center.\n\nLot refused to give his guests to the inhabitants of Sodom and, instead,\noffered them his two [virgin](/wiki/Almah \"Almah\") daughters \"which have not\n_known_ man\" and to \"do ye to them as _[is]_ good in your eyes\". However, they\nrefused this offer, complained about this alien, namely Lot, giving orders,\nand then came near to break down the door. Lot's angelic guests rescued him\nand struck the men with blindness and they informed Lot of their mission to\ndestroy the city. Then (not having found even 10 righteous people in the\ncity), they commanded Lot to gather his family and leave. As they made their\nescape, one angel commanded Lot to \"look not behind thee\" (singular \"thee\").\nHowever, as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with [brimstone and\nfire](/wiki/Fire_and_brimstone \"Fire and brimstone\") from the Lord, [Lot's\nwife](/wiki/Lot%27s_wife \"Lot's wife\") looked back at the city, and she became\na pillar of salt.\n\n## Other\nreferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sodom_and_Gomorrah&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Other references\")]\n\n[Major](/wiki/Major_prophets \"Major prophets\") and [minor\nprophets](/wiki/Minor_prophets \"Minor prophets\") in the [Hebrew\nBible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible \"Hebrew Bible\") have referred to Sodom and Gomorrah\nto parallel their prophetic events.

The unfortunate\nstranger would end up starving and after his death, the people who gave him\nthe money would reclaim it.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[Jon D. Levenson](/wiki/Jon_D._Levenson \"Jon D. Levenson\") views a rabbinic\ntradition described in the [Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah \"Mishnah\") as postulating\nthat the sin of Sodom was a violation of conventional hospitality in addition\nto homosexual conduct, describing Sodom's lack of generosity with the saying,\n\"What is mine is mine; what is yours is yours\" (_m. Avot_ 5.10).[39]\n\nA modern orthodox position is one that holds, \"The paradigmatic instance of\nsuch aberrant behavior is found in the demand of the men of Sodom to 'know'\nthe men visiting Lot, the nephew of Abraham, thus lending their name to the\npractice of 'sodomy'.\"[40]\n\n[Jay Michaelson](/wiki/Jay_Michaelson \"Jay Michaelson\") proposes a reading of\nthe story of Sodom that emphasizes the violation of hospitality as well as the\nviolence of the Sodomites. \"Homosexual rape is the way in which they violate\nhospitality—not the essence of their transgression. Reading the story of Sodom\nas being about homosexuality is like reading the story of an ax murderer as\nbeing about an ax.\"[41] Michaelson places the story of Sodom in context with\nother Genesis stories regarding Abraham's hospitality to strangers, and argues\nthat when other texts in the Hebrew Bible mention Sodom, they do so without\ncommentary on homosexuality. The verses cited by Michaelson include Jeremiah\n23:14,[[Jeremiah\n23:14]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+23%3A14&version=KJ21)\nwhere the sins of Jerusalem are compared to Sodom and are listed as adultery,\nlying, and strengthening the hands of evildoers; Amos 4:1-11 (oppressing the\npoor and crushing the needy);[[Amos\n4:1-11]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+4%3A1-11&version=KJ21)\nand Ezekiel 16:49-50,[[Ezekiel\n16:49-50]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+16%3A49-50&version=KJ21)\nwhich defines the sins of Sodom as \"pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of\nidleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand\nof the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and did _toevah_ before me, and\nI took them away as I saw fit.\" Michaelson uses _toevah_ in place of\n_abomination_ to emphasize the original Hebrew, which he explains as being\nmore correctly translated as \"taboo\".[42]\n\n###\nChristian[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sodom_and_Gomorrah&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Christian\")]\n\nSeveral theories have been advanced in [Christian](/wiki/Christian\n\"Christian\") thought concerning the sin of Sodom. One area of dispute is\nwhether the mob was demanding the homosexual rape of Lot's guests. A second\narea of dispute is whether the act of homosexuality or the act of\ninhospitality and violence towards foreigners is the more significant ethical\ndownfall of Sodom.[43][44]\n\nThe first contention between the two positions primarily focuses upon the\nmeaning of the Hebrew verb ידע (yada), translated as _know_ in the King James\nVersion:\n\n> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where [are] the men which came\n> in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.\n> —[Genesis\n> 19:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19%3A5&version=9)\n\nHowever, the word \"know\" in the King James Version has been used to refer to\nsexual intercourse. One example can be found in [Genesis\n4:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4%3A1&version=KJV)\nbetween Adam and Eve:\n\n> And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I\n> have gotten a man from the LORD.—[Genesis\n> 4:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4%3A1&version=KJV)\n\nSome Hebrew scholars believe that _yada_ , unlike the English word _know_ ,\nrequires the existence of a \"personal and intimate relationship\".[45] For this\nreason, many of the most popular of the 20th century translations, including\nthe New International Version, the New King James Version, and the New Living\nTranslation, translate _yada_ as \"have sex with\" or \"know ... carnally\" in\n[Gen\n19:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+19%3A5&version=NRSV)[46]\n\nThose who favor the non-sexual interpretation argue against a denotation of\nsexual behavior in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for _know_\nappears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only approximately 1% (13–14\ntimes)[37][47] of those references is it clearly used as a euphemism for\nrealizing sexual intimacy.[48] Instead, those who hold to this interpretation\nusually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the\nstrangers.[49]\n\nCountering this is the observation that one of the examples of _know_ meaning\nto know sexually occurs when Lot responds to the [Gen\n19:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+19%3A5&version=NRSV)\nrequest, by offering his daughters for rape, only three verses later in the\nsame narrative:\n\n> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray\n> you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes:\n> only unto these men do nothing.... —[Genesis\n> 19:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19%3A8&version=NRSV)\n\nThe following is a major text in regard to these conflicting opinions:\n\n> Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving\n> themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth\n> for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. —[Jude\n> 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude+1%3A7&version=NRSV)\n\nThis reference to \"going after strange flesh\" is understood in different ways\nto include something akin to bestiality, having illicit sex with strangers,\nhaving sex with angels, but most often God's destruction of the populations of\nthe four cities is interpreted to mean [homosexual](/wiki/Homosexual\n\"Homosexual\") (same-sex) relations.[50]\n\nMany who interpret the stories in a non-sexual context contend that as the\nword for \"strange\" is akin to \"another\", \"other\", \"altered\" or even \"next\",\nthe meaning is unclear, and if the condemnation of Sodom was the result of\nsexual activities perceived to be perverse, then it is likely that it was\nbecause women sought to commit fornication with \"other than human\" angels,[51]\nperhaps referring to [Genesis\n6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6&version=NRSV) or the\napocryphal [Book of Enoch](/wiki/Book_of_Enoch \"Book of Enoch\"). Countering\nthis, it is pointed out that [Genesis\n6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6&version=NRSV) refers\nto angels seeking women, not men seeking angels, and that both Sodom and\nGomorrah were engaged in the sin Jude describes before the angelic visitation,\nand that, regardless, it is doubtful that the Sodomites knew they were angels.\nIn addition, it is argued the word used in the King James Version of the Bible\nfor \"strange\", can mean unlawful or corrupted ([Rm.\n7:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rm.+7%3A3&version=NRSV);\n[Gal.\n1:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.+1%3A6&version=NRSV)),\nand that the apocryphal [Second Book of Enoch](/wiki/Second_Book_of_Enoch\n\"Second Book of Enoch\") (different from the Book of Enoch which Jude quotes\nfrom) condemns \"sodomitic\" sex (2 Enoch 10:3; 34:1),[52] thus indicating that\nhomosexual relations was the prevalent _physical_ sin of Sodom.[53]\n\nBoth the non-sexual and the [homosexuality](/wiki/Homosexuality\n\"Homosexuality\") view invoke certain classical writings as well as other\nportions of the Bible.[54][55]\n\n> Now this was the sin of Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed\n> and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and\n> did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have\n> seen. —[Ezekiel\n> 16:49-50](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+16%3A49-50&version=NRSV)\n\nHere the nonsexual view focuses on the inhospitality aspect, while the other\nnotes the description _detestable_ or\n_[abomination](/wiki/Abomination_\\(Bible\\) \"Abomination \\(Bible\\)\")_ , the\nHebrew word for which often denotes moral sins, including those of a sexual\nnature.[56][57]\n\nIn the [Gospel of Matthew](/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew \"Gospel of Matthew\") (and\ncorresponding verse) when [Jesus](/wiki/Jesus \"Jesus\") warns of a worse\njudgment for some cities than Sodom, inhospitality is perceived by some as the\nsin, while others see it fundamentally being impenitence:\n\n> If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off\n> your feet when you leave that home or town. I tell you the truth, it will be\n> more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that\n> town. —[Matthew\n> 10:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A14-15&version=NRSV)\n\nThe nonsexual view focuses on the cultural importance of hospitality, which\nthis biblical story shares with other ancient civilizations, such as [Ancient\nGreece](/wiki/Ancient_Greece \"Ancient Greece\") and [Ancient\nRome](/wiki/Ancient_Rome \"Ancient Rome\"), where\n[hospitality](/wiki/Hospitality \"Hospitality\") was of singular importance and\nstrangers were under the protection of the gods.[58]\n\nWithin the Christian Churches that agree on the possible sexual interpretation\nof _know_ (yada) in this context, there is still a difference of opinion on\nwhether homosexuality is important. On its website, the [Anglican\nCommunion](/wiki/Anglican_Communion \"Anglican Communion\") presents the\nargument that the story is \"not even vaguely about homosexual love or\nrelationships\", but is instead \"about dominance and [rape](/wiki/Rape \"Rape\"),\nby definition an act of violence, not of sex or love\". This argument that the\nviolence and the threat of violence towards foreign visitors is the true\nethical downfall of Sodom (and not homosexuality), also observes the\nsimilarity between the Sodom and Gomorrah and the [Battle of\nGibeah](/wiki/Battle_of_Gibeah \"Battle of Gibeah\") Bible stories. In both\nstories, an inhospitable mob demands the homosexual rape of a foreigner or\nforeigners. As the mob instead settles for the rape and murder of the\nforeigner's female concubine in the Battle of Gibeah story, the homosexual\naspect is generally seen as inconsequential, and the ethical downfall is\nunderstood to be the violence and the threat of violence towards foreigners by\nthe mob. This [Exodus\n22:21-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+22%3A21-24&version=NRSV)\nlesson is viewed by Anglicans as a more historically accurate way to interpret\nthe Sodom and Gomorrah story.[43][59]\n\n###\nIslamic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sodom_and_Gomorrah&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Islamic\")]\n\nMain article: [Lot in Islam](/wiki/Lot_in_Islam \"Lot in Islam\")\n\nThe Quran contains twelve references to \"the people of Lut\", the biblical Lot,\nbut meaning the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah (references 6:86-90; 7:80–84;\n11:74–83; 15:58-77; 21:74-75; 26:160–173; 27:54–58; 29:28–30, 33-35;\n37:133-138; 51:32-37; 54:33-38 and 66:10), and their destruction by God is\nassociated explicitly with their sexual practices:[60][61]\n\nThe 'people of Lot' transgressed consciously against the bounds of God. Their\navarice led to inhospitality and robbery, which in turn led to the humiliation\nof strangers by mistreatment and rape. It was their [abominable\nsin](/wiki/Islamic_views_on_sin \"Islamic views on sin\") of homosexual sex\nwhich was seen as symptomatic of their attitudes,[62][63] and upon Lot's\nexhorting them to abandon their transgression against God, they ridiculed\nhim,[64] and threatened him with dire consequences;[63][65][66] Lot only\nprayed to God to be saved from doing as they did. Then Gabriel met Lot and\nsaid that he must leave the city quickly, as God had given this command to Lot\nfor saving his life. In the Quran it was written that Lot's wife stayed behind\nas she had transgressed. She met her fate in the disaster, and only Lot and\nhis family were saved during the destruction of their city,[67] with the\nunderstanding that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are identified in Genesis,\nbut \"the location remains unnamed in the Qur'an\"[68]\n\nIn the Quran, surah (chapter) 26 Ash-Shu`arā' (The Poets) –\n\n> So, We saved him and his family, all.
