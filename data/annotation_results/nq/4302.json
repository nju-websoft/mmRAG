Created by\n[Disney Consumer Products](/wiki/Disney_Consumer_Products \"Disney Consumer\nProducts\") chairman [Andy Mooney](/wiki/Andy_Mooney \"Andy Mooney\") in the\nearly 2000s, the franchise features a line-up of [fictional female\nprotagonists](/wiki/List_of_Disney_characters_by_film \"List of Disney\ncharacters by film\") who have appeared in various [Disney\nfranchises](/wiki/Disney_animated_features_canon \"Disney animated features\ncanon\").\n\nThe franchise does not include all princess characters from the whole of\nDisney-owned media, but rather refers to specific characters from the\ncompany's animated films. As of\n2017[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit),\nthe eleven characters considered part of the franchise are [Snow\nWhite](/wiki/Snow_White_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Snow White \\(Disney\ncharacter\\)\"), [Cinderella](/wiki/Cinderella_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Cinderella\n\\(Disney character\\)\"), [Aurora](/wiki/Aurora_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Aurora\n\\(Disney character\\)\"), [Ariel](/wiki/Ariel_\\(Disney\\) \"Ariel \\(Disney\\)\"),\n[Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\"),\n[Jasmine](/wiki/Princess_Jasmine \"Princess Jasmine\"),\n[Pocahontas](/wiki/Pocahontas_\\(character\\) \"Pocahontas \\(character\\)\"),\n[Mulan](/wiki/Mulan_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Mulan \\(Disney character\\)\"),\n[Tiana](/wiki/Tiana_\\(Disney\\) \"Tiana \\(Disney\\)\"),\n[Rapunzel](/wiki/Rapunzel_\\(Disney\\) \"Rapunzel \\(Disney\\)\"), and\n[Merida](/wiki/Merida_\\(Disney\\) \"Merida \\(Disney\\)\").[3][4]\n\nThe franchise has released dolls, sing-along videos, apparel, home decor,\ntoys, and a variety of other products featuring some of the Disney\nPrincesses.[5] Licensees for the franchise include\n[Glidden](/wiki/Glidden_\\(paints\\) \"Glidden \\(paints\\)\") (wall paint), [Stride\nRite](/wiki/Stride_Rite \"Stride Rite\") (sparkly shoes), [Hasbro](/wiki/Hasbro\n\"Hasbro\") (games and dolls), and plastic [Fisher-Price](/wiki/Fisher-Price\n\"Fisher-Price\") figurines.[6]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Conception\n    * 1.2 Expansions\n  * 2 Disney Princesses\n    * 2.1 Classic era\n      * 2.1.1 Snow White\n      * 2.1.2 Cinderella\n      * 2.1.3 Aurora\n    * 2.2 Renaissance era\n      * 2.2.1 Ariel\n      * 2.2.2 Belle\n      * 2.2.3 Jasmine\n      * 2.2.4 Pocahontas\n      * 2.2.5 Mulan\n    * 2.3 Modern era\n      * 2.3.1 Tiana\n      * 2.3.2 Rapunzel\n      * 2.3.3 Merida\n  * 3 Portrayals in culture and media\n    * 3.1 Theme park rides\n      * 3.1.1 Disneyland\n      * 3.1.2 Walt Disney World\n    * 3.2 Meet-and-greets and live events\n      * 3.2.1 Disneyland\n        * 3.2.1.1 Fantasy Faire\n      * 3.2.2 Walt Disney World\n      * 3.2.3 Shanghai Disneyland\n    * 3.3 Films and television\n    * 3.4 Literature\n      * 3.4.1 _Disney Princess_ Chapter Books\n        * 3.4.1.1 _A Jewel Story_\n    * 3.5 Comic adaptation\n    * 3.6 Video games\n      * 3.6.1 Kingdom Hearts\n  * 4 Reception\n    * 4.1 Ethnic reception\n    * 4.2 Feminist reception\n  * 5 Notes\n  * 6 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Conception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Conception\")]\n\nStanding in line in the arena [of a [Disney on Ice](/wiki/Disney_on_Ice\n\"Disney on Ice\") show], I was surrounded by little girls dressed head to toe\nas princesses...They weren’t even Disney products. They were generic princess\nproducts they’d appended to a Halloween costume. And the light bulb went off.\nClearly, there was latent demand here. So the next morning I said to my team,\n\"O.K., let's establish standards and a color palette and talk to licensees and\nget as much product out there as we possibly can that allows these girls to do\nwhat they're doing anyway: projecting themselves into the characters from the\nclassic movies.\"\n\n—Mooney, on his creation of the Disney Princess franchise as reported by _[The\nNew York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_[7]\n\nFormer [Nike, Inc.](/wiki/Nike,_Inc. \"Nike, Inc.\") executive [Andy\nMooney](/wiki/Andy_Mooney \"Andy Mooney\") was appointed chairman of [The Walt\nDisney Company](/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company \"The Walt Disney Company\")'s\n[Disney Consumer Products](/wiki/Disney_Consumer_Products \"Disney Consumer\nProducts\") division in the late 1990s.[7][8] While attending his first [Disney\non Ice](/wiki/Disney_on_Ice \"Disney on Ice\") show, Mooney noticed that several\nyoung girls attending the show were dressed in princess attire that were not\nauthentic Disney products.[9] \"They were generic princess products they’d\nappended to a Halloween costume,\" Mooney told _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_. Concerned by this,\nMooney addressed the company the following morning and encouraged them to\ncommence work on a legitimate Disney Princess franchise in January 2000.[7]\nWalt's nephew, [Roy E. Disney](/wiki/Roy_E._Disney \"Roy E. Disney\"), objected\nto the creation of the line, as the company has long \"avoided mingling\ncharacters from its classic fairy tales in other narratives, worrying that it\nwould weaken the individual mythologies\".[2]\n\nThe original line-up consisted of princesses [Snow\nWhite](/wiki/Snow_White_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Snow White \\(Disney\ncharacter\\)\"), [Cinderella](/wiki/Cinderella_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Cinderella\n\\(Disney character\\)\"), [Aurora](/wiki/Aurora_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Aurora\n\\(Disney character\\)\"), [Ariel](/wiki/Ariel_\\(Disney\\) \"Ariel \\(Disney\\)\"),\n[Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\"),\n[Jasmine](/wiki/Princess_Jasmine \"Princess Jasmine\"),\n[Pocahontas](/wiki/Pocahontas_\\(character\\) \"Pocahontas \\(character\\)\"),\n[Mulan](/wiki/Mulan_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Mulan \\(Disney character\\)\") and\n[Tinker Bell](/wiki/Tinker_Bell \"Tinker Bell\"). Five of them (Snow White,\nAurora, Jasmine, Pocahontas, and Ariel) were royal by blood, two (Cinderella\nand Belle) married into royalty, and two (Mulan and Tinker Bell) fit the\n\"princess mythology.\" Tinker Bell was soon removed from the latter category\nand the overall line-up. This was the first time the characters would be\nmarketed in a separate franchise than their original films. Mooney decided\nthat, when featured on marketing advertisements such as posters, the\nprincesses should never make eye contact with each other in an attempt to keep\ntheir individual \"mythologies\" intact. \"[Each] stares off in a slightly\ndifferent direction as if unaware of the others' presence.\"[7]\n\nIn an unconventional manner, Mooney and his team launched the Disney Princess\nline without utilizing any [focus groups](/wiki/Focus_group \"Focus group\") and\nwith minimal marketing. By 2001, Disney Consumer Products (DCP) generated\nabout 300 million dollars, but by 2012, the division had increased revenue to\n3 billion dollars, making it the top seller of consumer entertainment products\nglobally.[10] DCP issued princess product licenses to Hasbro for games, Mattel\ndolls, and plastic Fisher-Price figurines in 2000, allowing the franchise to\nmeet the $1 billion mark in revenue in three years.[6]\n\n### Expansions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Expansions\")]\n\nTiana became the first additional character to the Princess franchise\nofficially on March 14, 2010, taking Tinker Bell's short-lived place as the\nninth member. Her coronation took place at the [New York\nPalace](/wiki/Lotte_New_York_Palace_Hotel \"Lotte New York Palace Hotel\").[11]\nTinker Bell was already heading up another franchise started in 2005, [Disney\nFairies](/wiki/Disney_Fairies \"Disney Fairies\").[12]\n\nRapunzel was \"[crowned](/wiki/Coronation \"Coronation\")\" and inducted into the\nDisney Princess franchise as the tenth member on October 2, 2011, at\n[Kensington Palace](/wiki/Kensington_Palace \"Kensington Palace\") in [London,\nEngland](/wiki/London,_England \"London, England\").[13] On May 11, 2013, Disney\nadded the first [Pixar](/wiki/Pixar \"Pixar\") character Merida as the 11th\nPrincess to the franchise in a coronation ceremony in front of Cinderella\nCastle at [Magic Kingdom](/wiki/Magic_Kingdom \"Magic Kingdom\") in [Walt Disney\nWorld](/wiki/Walt_Disney_World \"Walt Disney World\").[3]\n\nWith [Target Corporation](/wiki/Target_Corporation \"Target Corporation\") as\nits marketing partner, Disney held the first National Princess Week the week\nof April 22, 2012. During the week, there was the release of _[The Princess\nDiaries](/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_\\(film\\) \"The Princess Diaries \\(film\\)\")_\nBlu-ray and _The Very Fairy Princess_ book.[14] Harrod, already have a [Disney\nstores](/wiki/Disney_Store#Disney_at_Harrods \"Disney Store\") within, followed\nwith their Christmas theme being Disney Princess by having Oscar de la Renta\ndesigned dress for the Princess on display.[15] In August, the dress were on\ndisplay at [D23 Expo](/wiki/D23_\\(Disney\\) \"D23 \\(Disney\\)\") before being\nauctioned on November 13 to benefit [Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's\nCharity](/wiki/Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital_Children%27s_Charity \"Great Ormond\nStreet Hospital Children's Charity\").[16]\n\n[Mattel](/wiki/Mattel \"Mattel\") adding a Barbie princess-themed line in\nlate-2010 then the fair and fantasy store based _[Ever After\nHigh](/wiki/Ever_After_High \"Ever After High\")_ in 2013. Mattel was only\nputting out Princesses Cinderella, Ariel and Belle plus Anna and Elsa during\nthe last year or so of its license. With these competing lines and an\nexpiration of the brand license at the end of 2015, Disney gave\n[Hasbro](/wiki/Hasbro \"Hasbro\") a chance to gain the license given their work\non Star Wars which lead to a _[Descendants](/wiki/Descendants_\\(2015_film\\)\n\"Descendants \\(2015 film\\)\")_ license. DCP was also attempting to evolve the\nbrand by making them less as damsels and more as heroines. In September 2014,\nDisney announced that Hasbro would be the licensed doll maker for the Disney\nPrincess line starting on January 1, 2016.[6]\n\nThe June 2013 release of the Disney Princess Palace Pets app from Disney\nPublishing, led DCP to turn Palace Pets into a Disney Princess franchise\nextension, with the release of The Palace Pets toy line in August from\nlicensee [Blip Toys](/w/index.php?title=Blip_Toys&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Blip\nToys \\(page does not exist\\)\"). The line was also selected by\nTimetoPlayMag.com for its Most Wanted List Holiday 2013.[1] In 2015 Disney\nPublishing released animated shorts series _[Whisker Haven Tales with the\nPalace Pets](/wiki/Whisker_Haven_Tales_with_the_Palace_Pets \"Whisker Haven\nTales with the Palace Pets\")_. The shorts journey to a magical world of\nWhisker Haven, a secret realm located in a fairy-tale space between the Disney\nPrincess kingdoms.[17]\n\n## Disney\nPrincesses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Disney Princesses\")]\n\nPrincesses were given an official number in the franchise lineup starting with\nSnow White as the first and original Disney princess, with Cinderella being\nthe second, followed by Aurora and so on.[18]\n\n### Classic\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Classic era\")]\n\n#### Snow\nWhite[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Snow White\")]\n\nMain article: [Snow White (Disney\ncharacter)](/wiki/Snow_White_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Snow White \\(Disney\ncharacter\\)\")\n\n[Snow White](/wiki/Snow_White_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Snow White \\(Disney\ncharacter\\)\") is the first and original Disney Princess.[18] A main character\nin [Walt Disney Animation Studios](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios \"Walt\nDisney Animation Studios\")' 1st animated feature film _[Snow White and the\nSeven Dwarfs](/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_\\(1937_film\\) \"Snow White\nand the Seven Dwarfs \\(1937 film\\)\")_ (1937), Snow White is a beautiful young\nprincess, described by her evil stepmother's Magic Mirror as having 'hair as\nblack as ebony, lips as red as the rose, skin as white as snow' and also\ndubbed by the Mirror as the 'Fairest Of Them All'.[19] She is forced to seek\nrefuge in the home of the [seven dwarfs](/wiki/Seven_Dwarfs \"Seven Dwarfs\")\nwhere she hides from her evil stepmother, [Queen\nGrimhilde](/wiki/Queen_Grimhilde \"Queen Grimhilde\"), who got angered by the\nfact that Snow White's beauty was greater than hers. She asked the Huntsman to\nkill the princess; however, as an act of pity, he ends up setting her free and\ntelling her the Evil Queen's plan. Snow White is often described as a kind,\noptimistic, tidy and happy person who sees the good in everyone. Originally\nvoiced by [Adriana Caselotti](/wiki/Adriana_Caselotti \"Adriana Caselotti\") and\nanimated by [Marc Davis](/wiki/Marc_Davis_\\(animator\\) \"Marc Davis\n\\(animator\\)\") and [Les Clark](/wiki/Les_Clark \"Les Clark\"), she and her movie\nare based on the heroine and story of the German fairy tale _[Snow\nWhite](/wiki/Snow_White \"Snow White\")_ (1812) by the [Brothers\nGrimm](/wiki/Brothers_Grimm \"Brothers Grimm\"). She has also been voiced by\n[Mary Kay Bergman](/wiki/Mary_Kay_Bergman \"Mary Kay Bergman\"), Carolyn\nGardener, and most recently Katherine Von Till. A crisp, blood red apple has\nbecome her trademark with years of exposure.\n\nSnow White is often known as one of the most anti-feminist Disney princesses\nthrough her goodness, which leads to passivity, her living with the [Seven\nDwarfs](/wiki/Seven_Dwarfs \"Seven Dwarfs\"), her tendency to clean, and her\nawaiting of a prince to save her from her oppressions, which critics have\nviewed as [misogyny](/wiki/Misogyny \"Misogyny\") and a danger to young women\nwho will want to replicate these behaviors in their own lives.[20][21] While\nmany argue that she was a reflection of the era in which she was created,\nothers claim that the complexity of animation of the time made it too\ndifficult to add complexity to the characters in the film. Janet Maslin of\n[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\") claims,\n\"Aside from her great daintiness and her credentials as a fervent housekeeper,\nSnow White has no distinct personality. She exists only to be victimized by\nher wicked stepmother - a far more interesting character - and to wait for Mr.\nRight,\" that supports feminist theory,[22] but despite public feminist\nresponses to the character, Disney regards Snow White as kind, sweet and\nrespectful, encouraging children to, \"be a friend to all,\" in the same way she\nis depicted in the film.[23]\n\n####\nCinderella[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Cinderella\")]\n\nMain article: [Cinderella (Disney\ncharacter)](/wiki/Cinderella_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Cinderella \\(Disney\ncharacter\\)\")\n\n[Cinderella](/wiki/Cinderella_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Cinderella \\(Disney\ncharacter\\)\") is the second Disney Princess.[18] Her movie, Disney's 12th\nanimated feature film, is named after her,\n_[Cinderella](/wiki/Cinderella_\\(1950_film\\) \"Cinderella \\(1950 film\\)\")_ ,\nreleased in 1950. She is often considered the \"Leader of the Disney\nPrincesses\". Forced into servitude by her evil stepmother, [Lady\nTremaine](/wiki/List_of_Disney%27s_Cinderella_characters#Lady_Tremaine \"List\nof Disney's Cinderella characters\"), and her two cruel stepsisters,\n[Drizella](/wiki/List_of_Disney%27s_Cinderella_characters#Drizella_Tremaine\n\"List of Disney's Cinderella characters\") and\n[Anastasia](/wiki/List_of_Disney%27s_Cinderella_characters#Anastasia_Tremaine\n\"List of Disney's Cinderella characters\"), after her father's death, her only\nsource of happiness was her animal friends, which consists of birds and mice.\nWhile scrubbing the floors of her late father's mansion, an invitation to the\nPrince's ball is delivered, inviting all of the eligible women to attend so\nthat he can find a wife. While Cinderella meets the requirements to attend,\nher stepfamily forbids her, going so far as to rip apart the clothes that the\nmice and birds had created for her as the carriage arrives. When all seems\nlost, her [fairy\ngodmother](/wiki/List_of_Disney%27s_Cinderella_characters#Fairy_Godmother\n\"List of Disney's Cinderella characters\") gives her the means to attend, where\nshe falls in love with [the\nPrince](/wiki/List_of_Disney%27s_Cinderella_characters#Prince_Charming \"List\nof Disney's Cinderella characters\").\n\nCinderella is based on the heroine of the French fairy tale\n_[Cinderella](/wiki/Cinderella#Plot \"Cinderella\")_ by [Charles\nPerrault](/wiki/Charles_Perrault \"Charles Perrault\") and the German fairy tale\nAshputtel by the Brothers Grimm. Originally voiced by [Ilene\nWoods](/wiki/Ilene_Woods \"Ilene Woods\") and animated by [Marc\nDavis](/wiki/Marc_Davis_\\(animator\\) \"Marc Davis \\(animator\\)\"), in recent\nanimated features she is currently voiced by [Jennifer\nHale](/wiki/Jennifer_Hale \"Jennifer Hale\"). In the original movie,\nCinderella's hair was intended to be more of a strawberry-blonde color, but\ntoday she is depicted as having blonde hair. Also, her iconic [ball\ngown](/wiki/Ball_gown \"Ball gown\") is depicted as light blue instead of silver\nin nearly all media and merchandise. Cinderella is also known as \"Cinderelly\"\nby the mice. These days, her legendary glass slipper, which was used by the\nPrince to find her, symbolizes Cinderella's timeless character and tale.\n\nAs part of a new launch of live-action Disney classic recreation films,\nCinderella was portrayed by [Lily James](/wiki/Lily_James \"Lily James\") in the\n[2015 motion-picture](/wiki/Cinderella_\\(2015_Disney_film\\) \"Cinderella \\(2015\nDisney film\\)\"). The film is commended for remaining close to the original\nplot line of the animated feature supplemented by added depth to give the\noriginal character more background and dimension. Reviews cite the movie's\nusage of the mantra, \"have courage and be kind\" (\"But at least [Cinderella's]\noutward beauty is poignantly augmented by an inner kindness and courage,\nthings she manages to hold on to despite the abuses heaped upon her by her\nstepmother and stepsisters\"),[24] claiming it to support and to help modern\naudiences reinvigorate their admiration of one of the earliest Disney\nprincesses.\n\nLike Snow White, Cinderella faces feminist criticism for chasing after a man\nfor freedom, displaying household chores, and means of beauty as the only way\nto attract a man that viewers may see the need to perpetuate.[25] Disney,\nhowever, cites Cinderella as a persistent princess in the light of injustice,\nbelieving she sends the message to \"never give up.\"[26]\n\n#### Aurora[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Aurora\")]\n\nMain article: [Aurora (Disney character)](/wiki/Aurora_\\(Disney_character\\)\n\"Aurora \\(Disney character\\)\")\n\n[Aurora](/wiki/Aurora_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Aurora \\(Disney character\\)\"),\noriginally voiced by [Mary Costa](/wiki/Mary_Costa \"Mary Costa\"), is the third\nDisney Princess.[18] She first appeared in Disney's 16th animated feature film\n_[Sleeping Beauty](/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_\\(1959_film\\) \"Sleeping Beauty \\(1959\nfilm\\)\")_ (1959). The motion picture is adapted from the French fairy tale\n_[The Sleeping Beauty](/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty \"Sleeping Beauty\")_ by [Charles\nPerrault](/wiki/Charles_Perrault \"Charles Perrault\") (1697), from the German\nfairy tale _[Little Briar Rose](/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty \"Sleeping Beauty\")_\n(1812) by [The Brothers Grimm](/wiki/The_Brothers_Grimm \"The Brothers Grimm\")\nand from _[The Sleeping Beauty](/wiki/The_Sleeping_Beauty_\\(ballet\\) \"The\nSleeping Beauty \\(ballet\\)\")_ ballet by [Pyotr Ilyich\nTchaikovsky](/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky \"Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\")\n(1890). Aurora is a princess by birth, daughter of her kingdom's rulers and\nbetrothed to another kingdom's prince. She is described as having hair of\nsunshine gold and lips that shame the red rose; she is also often described as\nbeing kind, shy, sophisticated, and a hopeless romantic. At first, she is seen\nas a little naive and insecure as a result of being sheltered for most of her\nlife but, unlike Snow White, she is somewhat pluckier and more opinionated. In\nlater media, she is shown to have matured and become more self-assured,\nindependent and confident. She was later voiced by [Erin\nTorpey](/wiki/Erin_Torpey \"Erin Torpey\") and [Jennifer\nHale](/wiki/Jennifer_Hale \"Jennifer Hale\"), and is currently voiced by [Kate\nHiggins](/wiki/Kate_Higgins \"Kate Higgins\").\n\nAurora was also portrayed by [Elle Fanning](/wiki/Elle_Fanning \"Elle Fanning\")\nin the film _[Maleficent](/wiki/Maleficent_\\(film\\) \"Maleficent \\(film\\)\")_ ,\nthe movie about the fairy's backstory played by [Angelina\nJolie](/wiki/Angelina_Jolie \"Angelina Jolie\"). This live-action film is a part\nof a new series that Disney has been launching in order to give their classic\nfilms modern twists to contemporary audiences.[27]\n\nLike her counterparts in the first wave of animated Disney films, Aurora is\ncriticized for feminist depictions, mainly in the fact that she had very\nlittle involvement both in the fairy tale and in her own Disney movie, where\nPrincess Aurora only appears for about 30 minutes. In many bloggers' opinions,\n\"Aurora in the film is not a person, per se; she is the prize that the other\ncharacters fight over. She is an object, really, and that is not feminist at\nall,\".[28] Disney, on their Disney princesses website, claims Aurora to\ninspire young girls to \"always wonder.\"[29]\n\n### Renaissance\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Renaissance era\")]\n\n#### Ariel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Ariel\")]\n\nMain article: [Ariel (Disney)](/wiki/Ariel_\\(Disney\\) \"Ariel \\(Disney\\)\")\n\n[Ariel](/wiki/Ariel_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Ariel \\(Disney character\\)\") is the\nfourth Disney Princess, as well as the title character in Disney's 28th\nanimated feature film _[The Little\nMermaid](/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_\\(1989_film\\) \"The Little Mermaid \\(1989\nfilm\\)\")_ , released in 1989. She is the youngest of [King\nTriton](/wiki/King_Triton \"King Triton\")'s seven daughters. Ariel is a mermaid\nprincess in the undersea kingdom Atlantica (according to later media in the\nfranchise). Fascinated by the human world and tired of life under the sea,\nAriel makes a deal with Ursula, an evil sea witch, trading her voice for the\nchance to experience the human world. Based on the Danish fairy tale _[The\nLittle Mermaid](/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid \"The Little Mermaid\")_ by [Hans\nChristian Andersen](/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen \"Hans Christian Andersen\"),\nAriel is voiced by [Jodi Benson](/wiki/Jodi_Benson \"Jodi Benson\") and animated\nby [Glen Keane](/wiki/Glen_Keane \"Glen Keane\") and [Mark Henn](/wiki/Mark_Henn\n\"Mark Henn\"). The character was inspired by the protagonist in Andersen's\nstory but was developed into a different personality for the film.[30] Ariel\nis fiercely independent and a dreamer, which is notable in her collecting of\nhuman world treasures in her private grotto. She is bold and a risk-taker,\ndistinguished by her bright red hair, purple/lavender seashell bra and green\ntail.\n\n_[The Little Mermaid](/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_\\(1989_film\\) \"The Little\nMermaid \\(1989 film\\)\")_ was the first animated Disney Princess film following\n_[Sleeping Beauty](/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_\\(1959_film\\) \"Sleeping Beauty \\(1959\nfilm\\)\")_ from 1959.[31] As such, Ariel's film marks a new \"Renaissance\" of\nDisney that created more progressive, independent princesses with higher\nlevels of depth and complexity.[32] However, of all of the progressive\nPrincesses, Ariel is regarded as one of the least feminist ones depicted. She\nsings \"Part of Your World\" which pleads for a chance to explore her curiosity\nin the outside world, though critics cite that curiosity is largely driven by\nher desire to marry a man that she has never even spoken to. However, in\ndirect contrast to this criticism, Ariel was depicted in the film as being\ninterested in the human world and species and sang the song long before\nfalling in love with Eric. Without her voice, many fear that she is reliant on\nher beauty and sexuality only and, in the end, is saved by her male lover,\nPrince Eric, only to spend the rest of her life on the human world.[33]\nDisney, however, claims Ariel spreads a message of, \"explor[ing] new\nworlds,\"[34] that many other viewers notice throughout the film.[35]\n\n#### Belle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Belle\")]\n\nMain article: [Belle (Disney)](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\")\n\n[Belle](/wiki/Belle_\\(Disney\\) \"Belle \\(Disney\\)\") is the fifth Disney\nPrincess, first introduced in Disney's 30th animated feature film _[Beauty and\nthe Beast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(1991_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast\n\\(1991 film\\)\")_ (1991).

At first frightened by the\nBeast's physical appearance and repulsed by his selfishness, Belle learns to\nappreciate him after he rescues her from a pack of hungry wolves, expressing\nher gratitude by tending to his wounds. While the Beast's love for Belle\ngradually results in him adapting a more friendly and civil manner, Belle\nbefriends him, eventually managing to fall in love with him by the time the\nlast petal falls off an enchanted rose, which ultimately breaks a spell cast\non him and transforms him back into a handsome prince.\n\n[Emma Watson](/wiki/Emma_Watson \"Emma Watson\") portrays Belle in the live-\naction adaptation, which is also titled _[Beauty and the\nBeast](/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\\(2017_film\\) \"Beauty and the Beast \\(2017\nfilm\\)\")_. This live-action film is a part of a new series that Disney has\nbeen launching in order to give their classic films modern twists to\ncontemporary audiences.[40]\n\nPersonality-wise, Belle has been regarded as an independent,[41]\nintelligent,[42] courageous[43] and headstrong,[44] as well as a\n[feminist](/wiki/Feminist \"Feminist\").[45] The character has been universally\nlauded by critics, garnering specific praise and recognition for her\nintelligence and bravery. The _[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times\n\"Los Angeles Times\")_ hailed Belle as one of the Disney Princesses responsible\nfor \"break[ing] the bonds of convention\".[46] _[The Globe and\nMail](/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail \"The Globe and Mail\")_ praised the character,\ncomplimenting her intellect and labeling her the \"main attraction of _Beauty\nand the Beast_ \".[47] _[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly\n\"Entertainment Weekly\")_ highlighted the character's independence, calling her\n\"the hero\" of the film and accrediting her with making _Beauty and the Beast_\nthe best Disney Princess film.[48] _[The Washington\nPost](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_ described Belle as\n\"more mature, more womanly and less blandly [asexual](/wiki/Asexuality\n\"Asexuality\")\" than previous Disney heroines.[49] The [American Film\nInstitute](/wiki/American_Film_Institute \"American Film Institute\") nominated\nBelle for its list of [100 Years...100 Heroes and\nVillains](/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Heroes_and_Villains \"AFI's 100\nYears...100 Heroes and Villains\").[50] Belle remains the best-received Disney\nPrincess to-date. Disney cites Belle as a role model for the mantra, \"don't\njudge a book by its cover.\"[4][51]\n\n#### Jasmine[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Jasmine\")]\n\nMain article: [Princess Jasmine](/wiki/Princess_Jasmine \"Princess Jasmine\")\n\n[Jasmine](/wiki/Princess_Jasmine \"Princess Jasmine\") is the sixth Disney\nPrincess and the leading lady of Disney's 31st animated feature film\n_[Aladdin](/wiki/Aladdin_\\(1992_Disney_film\\) \"Aladdin \\(1992 Disney film\\)\")_\n(1992). Jasmine is fierce, bold, and confident, rarely allowing anyone to tell\nher how to live her life. Jasmine hungers for independence, tired of the\nrestrictions laid before her by her father. She falls in love with Aladdin\nwhile he is disguised as a prince after he takes her on a romantic ride on a\nmagic carpet. Aladdin's genie companion is summoned by Jafar, who uses the\ngenie's magic to tyrannically overthrow Jasmine's father, the Sultan. Luckily,\nafter Jafar's defeat, the Sultan permits Jasmine to wed Aladdin despite his\nlack of royal heritage. [Princess Jasmine](/wiki/Princess_Jasmine \"Princess\nJasmine\") is voiced by [Linda Larkin](/wiki/Linda_Larkin \"Linda Larkin\"),\nanimated by [Mark Henn](/wiki/Mark_Henn \"Mark Henn\"), and her singing voice is\nprovided by [Lea Salonga](/wiki/Lea_Salonga \"Lea Salonga\") (in the feature\nfilm) and [Liz Callaway](/wiki/Liz_Callaway \"Liz Callaway\") (in the [direct-\nto-video](/wiki/Direct-to-video \"Direct-to-video\") [sequel](/wiki/Sequel\n\"Sequel\")).

While a part\nof the new line of progressive princesses, shown by how Jasmine is more likely\nto leave the castle and has immense curiosity about the world beyond the\npalace walls, critics have judged her for her reliance on a man, sexuality\nthat is displayed more than in the other princesses prior, and for her false\nrepresentation of Middle Eastern culture. Her sexual depiction, particularly\nin a scene where she seduces the villain [Jafar](/wiki/Jafar \"Jafar\"), as well\nas her Western features, makes critics fear the messages Disney is spreading\nabout culture, as well as the continued image of women winning over men with\ntheir bodies: \"Other than skin tone, this feature appears to be the only\nsignifier of racial difference. In terms of the body. Jasmine, although still\nsmall-waisted is \"filmed\" in more active sequences and appears, through both\nthe physical presence and activity in scenes, more athletic.\"[33] Disney\nclaims its intention with Jasmine is to inspire viewers to \"see the good in\nothers.\"[53]\n\n####\nPocahontas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Pocahontas\")]\n\nMain article: [Pocahontas (character)](/wiki/Pocahontas_\\(character\\)\n\"Pocahontas \\(character\\)\")\n\n[Pocahontas](/wiki/Pocahontas_\\(character\\) \"Pocahontas \\(character\\)\") is the\nseventh Disney Princess and first appeared in Disney's 33rd animated feature\nfilm _[Pocahontas](/wiki/Pocahontas_\\(1995_film\\) \"Pocahontas \\(1995 film\\)\")_\n(1995). Based on the Native American chief's daughter,\n[Pocahontas](/wiki/Pocahontas \"Pocahontas\") (c. 1595–1617), and the settlement\nof [Jamestown, Virginia](/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia \"Jamestown, Virginia\") in\n1607. Pocahontas is displayed as a noble, independent and highly spiritual\nyoung woman. She expresses wisdom beyond her years and offers kindness and\nguidance to those around her. An adventurer and nature lover, in the film she\nappears to have shamanic powers since she was able to communicate with nature,\nspirits, and animals and understand foreign languages. In the sequel,\nPocahontas, after hearing of John Smith's assumed death, is heartbroken.\nDespite this, she keeps her independent spirit and playfulness and is even\nmuch more mature and self-assured than she was in the first film. During her\nstay in England, she nearly loses herself in the hustle and bustle of the new\nworld, consequently falling victim to western culture assimilation. But in the\nend, she bravely intends to sacrifice herself for her people's safety and\nreturns to her homeland, finding herself, and love, once again. She was voiced\nby [Irene Bedard](/wiki/Irene_Bedard \"Irene Bedard\") and animated by [Glen\nKeane](/wiki/Glen_Keane \"Glen Keane\") while her singing was provided by [Judy\nKuhn](/wiki/Judy_Kuhn \"Judy Kuhn\").\n\nLike Jasmine, Pocahontas, and her film, are criticized for the depiction of\nover-sexualized females in a culturally diverse world. Both princesses are\nshown with small waists, large almond eyes, and incredible athletic ability\nthat none of the other, caucasian Disney princesses represent. Further, the\nfilm has been met with criticism from the Native American community as\nheralding colonialism and an invalid, romanticized representation of an\nimportant figure to the Powhatan people. In terms of its 90s debut, Buescher\nand Ono in their critical review of the film claim that Pocahontas's actions,\n\"appropriates contemporary social issues of feminism, environmentalism, and\nhuman freedom in order to make racial domination appear innocent and\npure.\"[54] Despite these issues, Pocahontas is the first Disney Princess to\nnot continue her romantic relationship at the conclusion of the film and even\nplays a direct role in rescuing her lover, John Smith. She is considered to be\none of the most independent Disney princesses.[55] Disney claims Pocahontas as\na role model to \"respect the earth.\"[4] Pocahontas is the first Disney\nPrincess based on a real person.\n\n#### Mulan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Mulan\")]\n\nMain article: [Mulan (Disney character)](/wiki/Mulan_\\(Disney_character\\)\n\"Mulan \\(Disney character\\)\")\n\n[Fa Mulan](/wiki/Mulan_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Mulan \\(Disney character\\)\"), or\nsimply Mulan is the eighth Disney Princess[56] and first appeared in Disney's\n36th animated feature film _[Mulan](/wiki/Mulan_\\(1998_film\\) \"Mulan \\(1998\nfilm\\)\")_ (1998). The movie is adapted from the legend of [Hua\nMulan](/wiki/Hua_Mulan \"Hua Mulan\") (6th century; 'Northern and Southern\nDynasties' period). Mulan, atypical and unlike most previous female roles, is\ncourageous and more self-reliant. She also does not fit in with the\nexpectations of a young Chinese girl of the time; despite her natural beauty,\nshe is clumsy, outspoken, and independent rather than graceful, silent and\ndemure. After her meeting with the matchmaker ended in chaos, the matchmaker\nclaimed that even though she had the looks of a bride, she would never find a\nmatch. However, her courage, intelligence, and determination helped her\nthrough her adventures, in which she disguises herself as a male soldier in\norder to fight in the Chinese army in place of her wounded father. She was\nvoiced by [Ming-Na Wen](/wiki/Ming-Na_Wen \"Ming-Na Wen\") and animated by [Mark\nHenn](/wiki/Mark_Henn \"Mark Henn\") while her singing was provided by [Lea\nSalonga](/wiki/Lea_Salonga \"Lea Salonga\"). [Liu Yifei](/wiki/Liu_Yifei \"Liu\nYifei\") is set to portray Mulan in a live-action adaptation of the 1998\nanimated film.[57]\n\nMulan saves her people and is the hero of her own story. Because of this, many\nsee Mulan as a positive role model in her determination, risk-taking, and her\nconclusion of saving all of China.[55] Disney promotes Mulan as role model who\ncan help \"find your inner warrior.\"[4]\n\n### Modern\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Modern era\")]\n\n#### Tiana[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Tiana\")]\n\nMain article: [Tiana (Disney)](/wiki/Tiana_\\(Disney\\) \"Tiana \\(Disney\\)\")\n\n[Tiana](/wiki/Tiana_\\(Disney\\) \"Tiana \\(Disney\\)\"), voiced by [Anika Noni\nRose](/wiki/Anika_Noni_Rose \"Anika Noni Rose\") and animated by [Mark\nHenn](/wiki/Mark_Henn \"Mark Henn\"), is the ninth Disney Princess character to\nbe incorporated into the franchise, appearing in Disney's 49th animated\nfeature film _[The Princess and the Frog](/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_Frog \"The\nPrincess and the Frog\")_ (2009). Her film is loosely based on the novel _[The\nFrog Princess](/wiki/The_Frog_Princess_\\(novel\\) \"The Frog Princess\n\\(novel\\)\")_ by [E. D. Baker](/wiki/E._D._Baker \"E. D. Baker\"), which is in\nturn based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale _[The Frog\nPrince](/wiki/The_Frog_Prince_\\(story\\) \"The Frog Prince \\(story\\)\")_. Tiana\nis portrayed as being a hardworking, ambitious, and beautiful young woman who\nhas no love interest (at the start of the film). Living in New Orleans,\nLouisiana, Tiana strives to achieve her goal of opening her own restaurant (an\nambition inspired by the accomplishments of real-life restaurateur [Leah\nChase](/wiki/Leah_Chase \"Leah Chase\")).[58] However, she is transformed into a\nfrog after trying to break a spell cast by a Bokor on Prince Naveen that had\nchanged him into a frog also. Throughout the film, the pair must embark on a\nquest to find a way to break the spell. Tiana was officially \"coronated\" and\nbecame a member of the Disney Princess line-up on March 14, 2010, at the [New\nYork Palace Hotel](/wiki/Lotte_New_York_Palace_Hotel \"Lotte New York Palace\nHotel\") in [Manhattan, New York](/wiki/Manhattan,_New_York \"Manhattan, New\nYork\").[11]\n\nTiana marks the first princess in the \"fourth-wave\" feminist movement that\ninitiated the most modern line of Disney films, including movies like\n_Tangled_ , _Brave_ and _Frozen_. Unlike her past counterparts, Tiana has\nreceived more praise than criticism for her depiction of female independence\nand of minority culture. Christopher Lehman, author of \"The Colored Cartoon,\"\nclaims that, \"Princess and the Frog\" [i]s a step in the right direction\nbecause it deviates from those polarized caricatures with characters that are\ncrafted with individuality,\" those characters being either \"mammy\" or over\nsexualized versions of female African Americans. Instead, Tiana offers a new\nperspective as simply a hard-working woman who bears no reliance on a man.[59]\nDisney says Tiana represents \"mak[ing] a dream real.\"[4]\n\n#### Rapunzel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Rapunzel\")]\n\nMain article: [Rapunzel (Disney)](/wiki/Rapunzel_\\(Disney\\) \"Rapunzel\n\\(Disney\\)\")\n\n[Rapunzel](/wiki/Rapunzel_\\(Disney\\) \"Rapunzel \\(Disney\\)\") is the tenth\nDisney Princess.

Incarcerated in an isolated\ntower for eighteen years, Rapunzel enlists the help of a wanted thief named\n[Flynn Rider](/wiki/Flynn_Rider \"Flynn Rider\") to see the floating lanterns in\ntime for her 18th birthday.\n\nRapunzel is notably the first Disney Princess to appear in a\n[CGI](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-generated imagery\") film but\nis frequently revamped to a traditionally animated design when appearing in\nmerchandising alongside fellow, classically animated Princesses.\n\nThe character has been generally well received by most critics. Particular\npraise was awarded to her spirited personality and contemporaneity. The _[Los\nAngeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles Times\")_ described\nRapunzel as \"a very modern young woman\".[62] _[The New\nYorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker \"The New Yorker\")_ called Rapunzel a witty and\nintelligent character,[63] while _[USA Today](/wiki/USA_Today \"USA Today\")_\nwrote, \"Rapunzel is more believable in her teenage histrionics\" than previous\nDisney heroines.[64] However, some reviews, such as the two provided by _[Time\nOut](/wiki/Time_Out_\\(magazine\\) \"Time Out \\(magazine\\)\")_ , were less\nfavorable in their opinions of the character, describing her as both a\n\"bland\"[65] and \"synthetic\" character.[66] Disney describes her as promoting\n\"jump[ing] into new adventures.\"[4]\n\n#### Merida[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Merida\")]\n\nMain article: [Merida (Disney)](/wiki/Merida_\\(Disney\\) \"Merida \\(Disney\\)\")\n\n[Merida](/wiki/Merida_\\(Disney\\) \"Merida \\(Disney\\)\") is the eleventh Disney\nprincess, first appearing in the [Pixar](/wiki/Pixar \"Pixar\") film\n_[Brave](/wiki/Brave_\\(2012_film\\) \"Brave \\(2012 film\\)\")_ (2012).[3] Voiced\nby [Kelly Macdonald](/wiki/Kelly_Macdonald \"Kelly Macdonald\"), the character's\nsinging voice is provided by [Julie Fowlis](/wiki/Julie_Fowlis \"Julie\nFowlis\").

Merida is the 16-year-old\ndaughter of Queen Elinor, who rules the kingdom alongside King Fergus. Queen\nElinor's expectations of her daughter make Merida see her mother as being\ndistant while also causing friction between the two. Despite Elinor's desire\nto see Merida as a proper royal lady, Merida is an impetuous girl who wants to\ntake control of her own destiny. She has honed her skill in archery and is one\nof the most skilled archers ever seen. She is also skilled in sword-fighting\nand cross-country horse riding on her horse, Angus. Merida was \"coronated\" and\nofficially became a part of the Disney Princess franchise on May 11, 2013, at\n[Walt Disney World](/wiki/Walt_Disney_World \"Walt Disney World\")'s [Magic\nKingdom](/wiki/Magic_Kingdom \"Magic Kingdom\").[67]\n\nShe is the first Disney princess in the line-up to not have a love interest in\nher film, and the first to not sing in her film. Further, her stubbornness and\nindependence have generally resonated with feminists, as well as her near\nentire rejection of \"princess duties\" like marrying a man and looking\nproper.[68] She is also the first [Pixar](/wiki/Pixar \"Pixar\") and the second\nCGI princess.

Orenstein also noted the pervasive nature of Princess\nmerchandise and that every facet of play has its princess equivalent.[7]\nTamara Weston of _Time_ magazine criticized the franchise, referring to the\nprincesses as \"[damsels in distress](/wiki/Damsel_in_distress \"Damsel in\ndistress\")\" and negative role models for young girls.[92] Anna Smith of _The\nGuardian_ disliked that Disney princesses were typically drawn with slender\nfigures and large eyes.[93] Other sources have also voiced concern that the\nfranchise could possibly give young girls the wrong message.[94] However,\nother parents who have young daughters say that they would eventually grow out\nof this phase.[95]\n\nMany articles describe Disney Princesses as the beginnings of feminism.

Most\nof their adventures began with the recognition that most of their adventures\nbegan with rebellion against the patriarchy.[97]\n\nAnother article from Highbrow Magazine titled \"How Fourth-Wave Feminism is\nChanging Disney Princesses\" explains how the connection of feminism and Disney\nPrincesses and the waves of feminism shape the way film and TV illustrate\nwomen. The first wave of feminism took place during the time the first three\nDisney princess films were produced. As said in the article, for these\noriginal Disney princesses, their beauty is their most defining\ncharacteristic. In all three films, the prince falls in love with and\nsaves/marries the princess based solely on her appearance. These princesses\nare beautiful women and suffer because of circumstances out of their control\nand finally find salvation in the love of a powerful man.[98]\n\nKaitlin Eberson, the author of the article, explains how the second waved of\nfeminism that lasted until the 1980s went hand in hand with the civil rights\nmovement and focused on women’s legal and social equality. During this time\nAriel, Belle, Jasmine, Pocahontas, and Mulan illustrated the ideology of\nsociety’s drastically altered beliefs about who women are and how they should\nact, as each princess has a distinct personality.[98]\n\nThe earlier Disney princess films were criticized for their representation of\ndomestication, romance, and dependence on a male hero. The next wave of Disney\nprincess films, part of the so-called 'Progressive' Disney of the studio's\nrenaissance era of animation, attempted to make more independent female\ncharacters, though romance still played a large role in all of these films.\nThere was a long-time gap between the releases of _Mulan_ and _The Princess\nand the Frog_ , but the fourth wave of feminism discusses the issues faced by\nwomen and how women acknowledged the inequality between genders. During this\nwave, the films showed strong, independent women that were powerful and were\nnot submissive to a patriarchal society.[98]\n\n[A. O. Scott](/wiki/A._O._Scott \"A. O. Scott\") of _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ in 2016 described the\n\"feisty\" and \"battle-ready\" [Princess Leia](/wiki/Princess_Leia \"Princess\nLeia\") as \"a foremother of [Hermione Granger](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione\nGranger\") and [Katniss Everdeen](/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen \"Katniss Everdeen\")\nand of countless latter-day Disney princesses\".[99] Studies evaluating the\nprevalence of classic male and female qualities represented by varying\ncharacters in Disney animated films showed that the earlier films tended to\nhave more of the female characters displaying feminine characteristics at 86%,\nwhile the middle films were more along the lines of 58%. _The Princess and the\nFrog_ alone had 53% of feminine qualities featured in its films in comparison\nto male characteristics, showing the progression that Disney has undergone in\nterms of feminism and escaping gendered norms.[31] There is little data on the\nmost recent films; however, general viewer reception has been positive in\nregards to the \"feminist\" qualities that these princesses display.[100]\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Disney_Princess&action=edit&section=38\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Goldman Getzler, Wendy (October 2, 2013).
