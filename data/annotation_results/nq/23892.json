While he recovers from his [hangover](/wiki/Hangover \"Hangover\")\nthe following morning, she will deposit the proceeds in their bank account.\n\n##\nCharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_Gonna_Hire_a_Wino_to_Decorate_Our_Home&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Charts\")]\n\nChart (1982) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nUS [Hot Country Songs](/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs \"Hot Country Songs\") (_[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_)[2] | 1  \nCanadian _RPM_ Country Tracks | 3  \nCanadian _RPM_ Top Singles | 20  \n  \n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I%27m_Gonna_Hire_a_Wino_to_Decorate_Our_Home&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [Whitburn, Joel](/wiki/Joel_Whitburn \"Joel Whitburn\") (2004). _The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition_.
