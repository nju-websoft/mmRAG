([/ˈʃɑːrlɪmeɪn/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\"))\nor **Charles the Great**[a] (2 April 742[1][b] – 28 January 814), numbered\n**Charles I** , was [King of the Franks](/wiki/King_of_the_Franks \"King of the\nFranks\") from 768, [King of the Lombards](/wiki/King_of_the_Lombards \"King of\nthe Lombards\") from 774 and [Emperor of the Romans](/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor\n\"Holy Roman Emperor\") from 800. He united much of Europe during the early\n[Middle Ages](/wiki/Middle_Ages \"Middle Ages\"). He was the first recognised\nemperor in western Europe since the [fall of the Western Roman\nEmpire](/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire \"Fall of the Western Roman\nEmpire\") three centuries earlier. The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne\nfounded is called the [Carolingian Empire](/wiki/Carolingian_Empire\n\"Carolingian Empire\").\n\nCharlemagne was the oldest son of [Pepin the Short](/wiki/Pepin_the_Short\n\"Pepin the Short\") and [Bertrada of Laon](/wiki/Bertrada_of_Laon \"Bertrada of\nLaon\"), having been born before their canonical marriage.[2] He became king in\n768 following his father's death, initially as co-ruler with his brother\n[Carloman I](/wiki/Carloman_I_of_the_Franks \"Carloman I of the Franks\").\nCarloman's sudden death in December 771 under unexplained circumstances left\nCharlemagne as the sole, undisputed ruler of the Frankish Kingdom.[3] He\ncontinued his father's policy towards the [papacy](/wiki/Pope \"Pope\") and\nbecame its protector, removing the [Lombards](/wiki/Lombards \"Lombards\") from\npower in northern Italy and leading an incursion into [Muslim Spain](/wiki/Al-\nAndalus \"Al-Andalus\"). He campaigned against the [Saxons](/wiki/Saxons\n\"Saxons\") to his east, [Christianising them upon penalty of\ndeath](/wiki/Capitulatio_de_partibus_Saxoniae \"Capitulatio de partibus\nSaxoniae\") and leading to events such as the [Massacre of\nVerden](/wiki/Massacre_of_Verden \"Massacre of Verden\"). Charlemagne reached\nthe height of his power in 800 when he was [crowned _Emperor of the\nRomans_](/wiki/Coronation_of_the_Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Coronation of the Holy\nRoman Emperor\") by [Pope Leo III](/wiki/Pope_Leo_III \"Pope Leo III\") on\nChristmas Day at Rome's [Old St. Peter's\nBasilica](/wiki/Old_St._Peter%27s_Basilica \"Old St. Peter's Basilica\").\n\nCharlemagne has been called the \"Father of Europe\" (_Pater Europae_),[c] as he\nunited most of Western Europe for the first time since the [Roman\nEmpire](/wiki/Roman_Empire \"Roman Empire\"). His rule spurred the [Carolingian\nRenaissance](/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance \"Carolingian Renaissance\"), a\nperiod of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western\nChurch. All [Holy Roman Emperors](/wiki/List_of_Holy_Roman_Emperors \"List of\nHoly Roman Emperors\") considered their kingdoms to be descendants of\nCharlemagne's empire, up to the last [Emperor Francis\nII](/wiki/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor\") and\nthe [French](/wiki/List_of_French_monarchs \"List of French monarchs\") and\n[German](/wiki/List_of_German_monarchs \"List of German monarchs\")\nmonarchies.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nHowever, the [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church \"Eastern\nOrthodox Church\") views Charlemagne more controversially, labeling as\n[heterodox](/wiki/Heterodoxy \"Heterodoxy\") his support of the\n[filioque](/wiki/Filioque \"Filioque\") and recognition by the [Bishop of\nRome](/wiki/Bishop_of_Rome \"Bishop of Rome\") as legitimate Roman Emperor,\nrather than recognising [Irene of Athens](/wiki/Irene_of_Athens \"Irene of\nAthens\") of the [Eastern Roman Empire](/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire \"Eastern\nRoman Empire\"). These and other machinations led to the eventual split of Rome\nand Constantinople in the [Great Schism of\n1054](/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism \"East–West Schism\").[4][d]\n\nCharlemagne died in 814, having ruled as emperor for thirteen years. He was\nlaid to rest in his imperial capital city of [Aachen](/wiki/Aachen \"Aachen\").\nHe married at least four times and had three legitimate sons, but only his son\n[Louis the Pious](/wiki/Louis_the_Pious \"Louis the Pious\") survived to succeed\nhim.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Political background\n  * 2 Rise to power\n    * 2.1 Early life\n      * 2.1.1 Date of birth\n      * 2.1.2 Place of birth\n    * 2.2 Ancestry\n    * 2.3 Ambiguous high office\n    * 2.4 Aquitaine rebellion\n      * 2.4.1 Formation of a new Aquitania\n      * 2.4.2 Acquisition of Aquitania by the Carolingians\n      * 2.4.3 Loss and recovery of Aquitania\n    * 2.5 Perforce union\n  * 3 Italian campaigns\n    * 3.1 Conquest of the Lombard kingdom\n    * 3.2 Southern Italy\n  * 4 Children\n  * 5 Carolingian expansion to the south\n    * 5.1 Vasconia and the Pyrenees\n    * 5.2 Roncesvalles campaign\n    * 5.3 Contact with the Saracens\n    * 5.4 Wars with the Moors\n  * 6 Eastern campaigns\n    * 6.1 Saxon Wars\n    * 6.2 Submission of Bavaria\n    * 6.3 Avar campaigns\n    * 6.4 Northeast Slav expeditions\n    * 6.5 Southeast Slav expeditions\n  * 7 Imperium\n    * 7.1 Coronation\n      * 7.1.1 Debate\n    * 7.2 Imperial title\n    * 7.3 Imperial diplomacy\n    * 7.4 Danish attacks\n    * 7.5 Death\n  * 8 Administration\n    * 8.1 Military\n    * 8.2 Economic and monetary reforms\n    * 8.3 Jews in Charlemagne's realm\n    * 8.4 Education reforms\n    * 8.5 Church reforms\n    * 8.6 Writing reforms\n    * 8.7 Political reforms\n      * 8.7.1 Organisation\n      * 8.7.2 Divisio regnorum\n  * 9 Personality\n    * 9.1 Manner\n    * 9.2 Language\n    * 9.3 Appearance\n    * 9.4 Dress\n    * 9.5 Homes\n  * 10 Family\n    * 10.1 Marriages and heirs\n    * 10.2 Ancestry\n  * 11 Name\n  * 12 Beatification\n  * 13 Cultural uses\n    * 13.1 Middle Ages\n    * 13.2 Modern era\n  * 14 Books and libraries\n  * 15 See also\n  * 16 Notes\n  * 17 References\n    * 17.1 Citations\n    * 17.2 Bibliography\n  * 18 External links\n\n## Political\nbackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Political background\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Francia_at_the_death_of_Pepin_of_Heristal%2C_714.jpg/275px-\nFrancia_at_the_death_of_Pepin_of_Heristal%2C_714.jpg)](/wiki/File:Francia_at_the_death_of_Pepin_of_Heristal,_714.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Francia_at_the_death_of_Pepin_of_Heristal,_714.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFrancia, early 8th century\n\nBy the 6th century, the western [Germanic](/wiki/Germanic_peoples \"Germanic\npeoples\") tribe of the [Franks](/wiki/Franks \"Franks\") had been\n[Christianised](/wiki/Germanic_Christianity \"Germanic Christianity\"), due in\nconsiderable measure to the Catholic conversion of Clovis I.[5]\n[Francia](/wiki/Francia \"Francia\"), ruled by the\n[Merovingians](/wiki/Merovingians \"Merovingians\"), was the most powerful of\nthe kingdoms that succeeded the [Western Roman\nEmpire](/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire \"Western Roman Empire\").[6] Following the\n[Battle of Tertry](/wiki/Battle_of_Tertry \"Battle of Tertry\") the Merovingians\ndeclined into powerlessness, for which they have been dubbed the _[rois\nfainéants](/wiki/Rois_fain%C3%A9ants \"Rois fainéants\")_ (\"do-nothing\nkings\").[7] Almost all government powers were exercised by their chief\nofficer, the [mayor of the palace](/wiki/Mayor_of_the_palace \"Mayor of the\npalace\").[e]\n\nIn 687, [Pepin of Herstal](/wiki/Pepin_of_Herstal \"Pepin of Herstal\"), mayor\nof the palace of [Austrasia](/wiki/Austrasia \"Austrasia\"), ended the strife\nbetween various kings and their mayors with his victory at Tertry.[8] He\nbecame the sole governor of the entire Frankish kingdom. Pepin was the\ngrandson of two important figures of the Austrasian Kingdom: Saint [Arnulf of\nMetz](/wiki/Arnulf_of_Metz \"Arnulf of Metz\") and [Pepin of\nLanden](/wiki/Pepin_of_Landen \"Pepin of Landen\").[9] Pepin of Herstal was\neventually succeeded by his illegitimate son Charles, later known as [Charles\nMartel](/wiki/Charles_Martel \"Charles Martel\") (Charles the Hammer).[10]\n\nAfter 737, Charles governed the Franks in lieu of a king and declined to call\nhimself _king_. Charles was succeeded in 741 by his sons\n[Carloman](/wiki/Carloman_\\(mayor_of_the_palace\\) \"Carloman \\(mayor of the\npalace\\)\") and [Pepin the Short](/wiki/Pepin_the_Short \"Pepin the Short\"), the\nfather of Charlemagne. In 743, the brothers placed [Childeric\nIII](/wiki/Childeric_III \"Childeric III\") on the throne to curb separatism in\nthe periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in\n746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of\nthe kingship before [Pope Zachary](/wiki/Pope_Zachary \"Pope Zachary\"), asking\nwhether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down\nhis decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king,\nas he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the\nhierarchy. He therefore ordered him to become the _true king_.[11]\n\nExternal video [![Charlemagne at dinner - British Library Royal MS 15 E vi\nf155r\n\\(detail\\).jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Charlemagne_at_dinner_-\n_British_Library_Royal_MS_15_E_vi_f155r_%28detail%29.jpg/210px-\nCharlemagne_at_dinner_-\n_British_Library_Royal_MS_15_E_vi_f155r_%28detail%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charlemagne_at_dinner_-\n_British_Library_Royal_MS_15_E_vi_f155r_\\(detail\\).jpg)  \n---  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/16px-\nNuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png) [The Early Middle Ages, 284--1000:\nCharlemagne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diwsP8eOpvE), 46:14, YaleCourses\non YouTube, [Yale University](/wiki/Yale_University \"Yale University\")  \n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/16px-\nNuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png) [Charlemagne: An\nIntroduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4PI8dEWTGE),\n[Smarthistory](/wiki/Smarthistory \"Smarthistory\"), 7:49, [Khan\nAcademy](/wiki/Khan_Academy \"Khan Academy\")  \n  \nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the\narchbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric\nIII as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian\ndynasty was thereby replaced by the [Carolingian](/wiki/Carolingian\n\"Carolingian\") dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [Pope Stephen\nII](/wiki/Pope_Stephen_II \"Pope Stephen II\") fled from Italy to Francia,\nappealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was\nsupported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother. In return, the pope\ncould provide only legitimacy. He did this by again anointing and confirming\nPepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to\nthe royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already\ncovered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation\nto visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the\n[Lombards](/wiki/Lombards \"Lombards\").[11][12]\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area\nincluding most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed\nthe basis for modern [France](/wiki/History_of_France \"History of France\") and\n[Germany](/wiki/History_of_Germany \"History of Germany\"). Orman[13] portrays\nthe [Treaty of Verdun](/wiki/Treaty_of_Verdun \"Treaty of Verdun\") (843)\nbetween the warring grandsons of Charlemagne as the foundation event of an\nindependent France under its first king [Charles the\nBald](/wiki/Charles_the_Bald \"Charles the Bald\"); an independent Germany under\nits first king [Louis the German](/wiki/Louis_the_German \"Louis the German\");\nand an independent intermediate state stretching from the [low\ncountries](/wiki/Low_countries \"Low countries\") along the borderlands to south\nof Rome under [Lothair I](/wiki/Lothair_I \"Lothair I\"), who retained the title\nof emperor and the capitals [Aachen](/wiki/Aachen \"Aachen\") and\n[Rome](/wiki/Rome \"Rome\") without the jurisdiction. The middle kingdom had\nbroken up by 890 and partly absorbed into Western kingdom (later France) and\nEastern kingdom (Germany) and the rest developing into smaller \"buffer\"\nnations that exist between France and Germany to this day, namely the\n[Benelux](/wiki/Benelux \"Benelux\") and [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland\n\"Switzerland\"). The concept and memory of a united Europe remains topical to\nthe current time and hence Charlemagne is often considered the forefather of\nmodern Europe.[14]\n\n## Rise to power[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Rise to power\")]\n\n### Early life[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Early life\")]\n\n#### Date of birth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Date of birth\")]\n\nThe most likely date of Charlemagne's birth is reconstructed from several\nsources. The date of 742—calculated from [Einhard](/wiki/Einhard \"Einhard\")'s\ndate of death of January 814 at age 72—predates the marriage of his parents in\n744. The year given in the _[Annales Petaviani](/wiki/Annales_Petaviani\n\"Annales Petaviani\")_ , 747, would be more likely, except that it contradicts\nEinhard and a few other sources in making Charlemagne seventy years old at his\ndeath. The month and day of 2 April are established by a calendar from [Lorsch\nAbbey](/wiki/Lorsch_Abbey \"Lorsch Abbey\").[15]\n\nIn 747, [Easter](/wiki/Easter \"Easter\") fell on 2 April, a coincidence that\nlikely would have been remarked upon by chroniclers but was not.[16] If Easter\nwas being used as the beginning of the calendar year, then 2 April 747 could\nhave been, by modern reckoning, April 748 (not on Easter). The date favoured\nby the preponderance of evidence[17] is 2 April 742, based on Charlemagne's\nage at the time of his death.[15] This date supports the concept that\nCharlemagne was technically an [illegitimate](/wiki/Illegitimacy\n\"Illegitimacy\") child, although that is not mentioned by Einhard, since he was\nborn out of wedlock; Pepin and Bertrada were bound by a private contract or\n[Friedelehe](/wiki/Friedelehe \"Friedelehe\")[18] at the time of his birth, but\ndid not marry until 744.[19]\n\n#### Place of\nbirth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Place of birth\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Spoorlijn37.png/275px-\nSpoorlijn37.png)](/wiki/File:Spoorlijn37.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Spoorlijn37.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nRegion of Aachen-Liège (contemporary borders, trade- and travel routes).\n\nCharlemagne's exact birthplace is unknown, although historians have suggested\n[Aachen](/wiki/Aachen \"Aachen\") in modern-day Germany, and\n[Liège](/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge \"Liège\") ([Herstal](/wiki/Herstal \"Herstal\")) in\npresent-day Belgium as possible locations.[20] Aachen and Liège are close to\nthe region from where the Merovingian and Carolingian families originated.\nOther cities have been suggested, including [Düren](/wiki/D%C3%BCren \"Düren\"),\n[Gauting](/wiki/Gauting \"Gauting\"), [Mürlenbach](/wiki/M%C3%BCrlenbach\n\"Mürlenbach\"),[21] [Quierzy](/wiki/Quierzy \"Quierzy\") and\n[Prüm](/wiki/Pr%C3%BCm \"Prüm\"). No definitive evidence resolves the question.\n\n### Ancestry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Ancestry\")]\n\nCharlemagne was the eldest child of [Pepin the Short](/wiki/Pepin_the_Short\n\"Pepin the Short\") (714 – 24 September 768, reigned from 751) and his wife\n[Bertrada of Laon](/wiki/Bertrada_of_Laon \"Bertrada of Laon\") (720 – 12 July\n783), daughter of [Caribert of Laon](/wiki/Caribert_of_Laon \"Caribert of\nLaon\") and [Bertrada of Cologne](/wiki/Bertrada_of_Cologne \"Bertrada of\nCologne\"). Many historians consider Charlemagne (Charles) to have been\nillegitimate, although some state that this is arguable,[22] because Pepin did\nnot marry Bertrada until 749, which was after Charles' birth; this status did\nnot exclude him from the succession.[23][24][25]\n\nRecords name only [Carloman](/wiki/Carloman_I,_King_of_the_Franks \"Carloman I,\nKing of the Franks\"), [Gisela](/wiki/Gisela_\\(daughter_of_Pepin_the_Short\\)\n\"Gisela \\(daughter of Pepin the Short\\)\"), and three short-lived children\nnamed Pepin, Chrothais and Adelais as his younger siblings.\n\n> It would be folly, I think, to write a word concerning Charles' birth and\n> infancy, or even his boyhood, for nothing has ever been written on the\n> subject, and there is no one alive now who can give information on it.\n> Accordingly, I determined to pass that by as unknown, and to proceed at once\n> to treat of his character, his deeds, and such other facts of his life as\n> are worth telling and setting forth, and shall first give an account of his\n> deeds at home and abroad, then of his character and pursuits, and lastly of\n> his administration and death, omitting nothing worth knowing or necessary to\n> know.\n>\n> — [Einhard](/wiki/Einhard \"Einhard\")[26]\n\n### Ambiguous high\noffice[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Ambiguous high office\")]\n\nFurther information: [Mayor of the Palace](/wiki/Mayor_of_the_Palace \"Mayor of\nthe Palace\")\n\nThe most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace\n(_Maior Domus_) and one or more kings (_rex_ , _reges_), were appointed by the\nelection of the people. Elections were not periodic, but were held as required\nto elect officers _ad quos summa imperii pertinebat_ , \"to whom the highest\nmatters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the\nPope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people\nthat met annually.[27]\n\nBefore he was elected king in 750, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office\nhe held \"as though hereditary\" (_velut hereditario fungebatur_). Einhard\nexplains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the\ndistinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received\nit as though hereditary, as had their father, [Charles\nMartel](/wiki/Charles_Martel \"Charles Martel\"). There was, however, a certain\nambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property:\none Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.[28] Each, however, had his own\ngeographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately\na Benedictine at [Monte Cassino](/wiki/Monte_Cassino \"Monte Cassino\"),[29] the\nquestion of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He\nconverted the Mayorship into a Kingship and awarded the joint property to\nPepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.[30]\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented\nto the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his\nson, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the\nPope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an\nheir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the\ndecision and was joined by [Grifo](/wiki/Grifo \"Grifo\"), a half-brother of\nPepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was\nstripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an\nattempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in\nthe Battle of [Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne](/wiki/Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne \"Saint-\nJean-de-Maurienne\") while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.[31]\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his\nsons, \"with divine assent\" (_divino nutu_).[32] According to the _Life_ ,\nPepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (_generali conventu_)\ngave them both the rank of a king (_reges_) but \"partitioned the whole body of\nthe kingdom equally\" (_totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur_). The\n_annals_[33] tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [St-\nDenis](/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis \"Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis\"),\nnear Paris. The two \"lords\" (_domni_) were \"elevated to kingship\" (_elevati\nsunt in regnum_), Charles on 9 October in [Noyon](/wiki/Noyon \"Noyon\"),\nCarloman on an unspecified date in [Soissons](/wiki/Soissons \"Soissons\"). If\nborn in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his\nfather's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his\nmilitary skill. [Carloman](/wiki/Carloman_I \"Carloman I\") was 17.\n\nThe language in either case suggests that there were not two inheritances,\nwhich would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a\nsingle joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings,\nCharles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were\nawarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of\nthe kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [Neustria](/wiki/Neustria\n\"Neustria\"), western [Aquitaine](/wiki/Aquitaine \"Aquitaine\"), and the\nnorthern parts of [Austrasia](/wiki/Austrasia \"Austrasia\"); while Carloman was\nawarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia,\n[Septimania](/wiki/Septimania \"Septimania\"), eastern Aquitaine,\n[Burgundy](/wiki/Burgundy_\\(region\\) \"Burgundy \\(region\\)\"), Provence, and\n[Swabia](/wiki/Swabia \"Swabia\"), lands bordering [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\").\nThe question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the\nother brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the\ndescendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up\nrepeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne\ncreated distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n### Aquitaine\nrebellion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Aquitaine rebellion\")]\n\nAn inheritance in the countries formerly under Roman law (_[ius](/wiki/Ius\n\"Ius\")_ or _iustitia_) represented not only a transmission of the properties\nand privileges but also the encumbrances and obligations attached to the\ninheritance. Pepin at his death had been in process of building an empire, a\ndifficult task. According to Russell:[34]\n\n> In those times, to build a kingdom from an aggregation of small states was\n> itself no great difficulty... But to keep the state intact after it had been\n> formed was a colossal task... Each of the minor states...had its little\n> sovereign...who...gave himself chiefly to...plotting, pillaging and\n> fighting.\n\n#### Formation of a new\nAquitania[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Formation of a new Aquitania\")]\n\nMain article: [Aquitaine](/wiki/Aquitaine \"Aquitaine\")\n\nAquitania under Rome had been in southern [Gaul](/wiki/Gaul \"Gaul\"), Romanised\nand speaking a [Romance language](/wiki/Romance_language \"Romance language\").\nSimilarly [Hispania](/wiki/Hispania \"Hispania\") had been populated by peoples\nwho spoke various languages, including [Celtic](/wiki/Celtic_language \"Celtic\nlanguage\"), but the area was now populated entirely by Romance language\nspeakers. Between Aquitania and Hispania were the [Euskaldunak](/wiki/Basques\n\"Basques\"), Latinised to [Vascones](/wiki/Vascones \"Vascones\"), or\n[Basques](/wiki/Basques \"Basques\"),[35] living in Basque country, Vasconia,\nwhich extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to\nthe Basques, most densely in the western [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees \"Pyrenees\")\nbut also as far south as the upper [Ebro River](/wiki/Ebro_River \"Ebro River\")\nin Spain and as far north as the [Garonne River](/wiki/Garonne_River \"Garonne\nRiver\") in France.[36] The French name, [Gascony](/wiki/Gascony \"Gascony\"),\nderives from [Vasconia](/wiki/Vasconia \"Vasconia\"). The Romans were never able\nto entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the\nregion's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for\ntheir fighting abilities. The border with Aquitania was\n[Toulouse](/wiki/Toulouse \"Toulouse\").\n\nAt about 660, the [Duchy of Vasconia](/wiki/Duchy_of_Vasconia \"Duchy of\nVasconia\") united with the [Duchy of Aquitania](/wiki/Duke_of_Aquitaine \"Duke\nof Aquitaine\") to form a single kingdom under [Felix of\nAquitaine](/wiki/Felix_of_Aquitaine \"Felix of Aquitaine\"), governing from\nToulouse. This was a joint kingship with a 28-year-old Basque king, [Lupus\nI](/wiki/Lupus_I_of_Aquitaine \"Lupus I of Aquitaine\"). _Lupus_ is the Latin\ntranslation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".[37] The kingdom was sovereign and\nindependent. Vasconia gave up predation to become a player on the field of\nEuropean politics. Whatever arrangements Felix had made with the Merovingians\nbecame null and void. At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the\nkingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint\ninheritance, but practised [primogeniture](/wiki/Primogeniture\n\"Primogeniture\"), Lupus in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque kings\nof an expanded Aquitania.[38]\n\n#### Acquisition of Aquitania by the\nCarolingians[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Acquisition of Aquitania by the Carolingians\")]\n\nFurther information: [Umayyad conquest of\nHispania](/wiki/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania \"Umayyad conquest of Hispania\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Al-\nAndalus732.jpg/250px-Al-Andalus732.jpg)](/wiki/File:Al-Andalus732.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Al-Andalus732.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMoorish Hispania in 732\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [Visigothic](/wiki/Visigoths \"Visigoths\")\n[Hispania](/wiki/Hispania \"Hispania\") omit many details, such as\nidentification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of\nnumerous contradictions.[39] Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent\nview, such as in the _Ta 'rikh iftitah al-Andalus_ (\"History of the Conquest\nof al-Andalus\") by [Ibn al-Qūṭiyya](/wiki/Ibn_al-Q%C5%AB%E1%B9%ADiyya \"Ibn al-\nQūṭiyya\") (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of\n[Wittiza](/wiki/Wittiza \"Wittiza\"), the last Visigothic king of a united\nHispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Qūṭiyya, who had another, much longer\nname, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Qūṭiyya[40] [Wittiza](/wiki/Wittiza \"Wittiza\"), |the last\nVisigothic king of a united Hispania, died before his three sons, Almund,\nRomulo and Ardabast, reached maturity. Their mother was regent at\n[Toledo](/wiki/Toledo,_Spain \"Toledo, Spain\"), but [Roderic](/wiki/Roderic\n\"Roderic\"), army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing\n[Córdoba](/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Spain \"Córdoba, Spain\"). He chose to impose a\njoint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a\ndivision of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with\nthe name of each king and in the king lists.[41] Wittiza was succeeded by\nRoderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila),\nwho reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the\nincursion of the [Saracens](/wiki/Saracens \"Saracens\"), then Roderic appears\nto have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's\nkingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken\nthe rest, notably modern [Portugal](/wiki/Portugal \"Portugal\").\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's\n[Septimania](/wiki/Septimania \"Septimania\"), only to encounter the Basque\ndynasty of Aquitania, always the allies of the Goths. [Odo the\nGreat](/wiki/Odo_the_Great \"Odo the Great\") of [Aquitania](/wiki/Aquitania\n\"Aquitania\") was at first victorious at the [Battle of\nToulouse](/wiki/Battle_of_Toulouse_\\(721\\) \"Battle of Toulouse \\(721\\)\") in\n721.[42] Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army\nunder Emir Abd al-Rahman abd Allah al-Ghafiqi advanced into Vasconia, and Odo\nwas defeated at the [Battle of the River\nGaronne](/wiki/Battle_of_the_River_Garonne \"Battle of the River Garonne\").\nThey took [Bordeaux](/wiki/Bordeaux \"Bordeaux\") and were advancing towards\n[Tours](/wiki/Tours \"Tours\") when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his\narch-enemy, [Charles Martel](/wiki/Charles_Martel \"Charles Martel\"), mayor of\nthe Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the\nCarolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of\nthe Saracens between Tours and [Poitiers](/wiki/Poitiers \"Poitiers\"), and in\nthe [Battle of Tours](/wiki/Battle_of_Tours \"Battle of Tours\") decisively\ndefeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time\nsuffering defeat at Charles' hands—at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737[43]\nand in the Dauphine in 740.[44] Odo's price for salvation from the Saracens\nwas incorporation into the Frankish kingdom, a decision that was repugnant to\nhim and also to his heirs.\n\n#### Loss and recovery of\nAquitania[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Loss and recovery of Aquitania\")]\n\nAfter the death of his father, [Hunald](/wiki/Hunald_of_Aquitaine \"Hunald of\nAquitaine\") allied himself with free [Lombardy](/wiki/Lombardy \"Lombardy\").\nHowever, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons,\n[Hunald](/wiki/Hunald \"Hunald\") and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now\nwent to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded\nand imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he\nresigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told un\n[Annales Mettenses priores](/wiki/Annales_Mettenses_priores \"Annales Mettenses\npriores\").[45] His son [Waifer](/wiki/Waiofar \"Waiofar\") took an early\ninheritance, becoming duke of Aquitania and ratified the alliance with\nLombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which\nhe justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid\non Martel's death. Since [Aquitania](/wiki/Aquitania \"Aquitania\") was now\nPepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance given by Charles Martel,\naccording to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down\nWaifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.[46]\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [Bavarians](/wiki/Bavaria\n\"Bavaria\") under [Tassilo III, Duke of\nBavaria](/wiki/Tassilo_III,_Duke_of_Bavaria \"Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria\"),\nan [Agilofing](/wiki/Agilofing \"Agilofing\"), the hereditary Bavarian ducal\nfamily. [Grifo](/wiki/Grifo \"Grifo\") had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria,\nbut Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo,\nwhose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of\nthe Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths\nof loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married\n[Liutperga](/wiki/Liutperga \"Liutperga\"), a daughter of\n[Desiderius](/wiki/Desiderius \"Desiderius\"), king of [Lombardy](/wiki/Lombardy\n\"Lombardy\"). At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with\nall his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to\nFrancia.[47] Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a\nfew weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians\nand [Gascons](/wiki/Gascony \"Gascony\"), in 769, in that territory split\nbetween the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated\n[Waifer](/wiki/Waifer_of_Aquitaine \"Waifer of Aquitaine\"), [Duke of\nAquitaine](/wiki/Duke_of_Aquitaine \"Duke of Aquitaine\"), after waging a\ndestructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, another Hunald (seemingly\nnot [Hunald](/wiki/Hunald_of_Aquitaine \"Hunald of Aquitaine\") the duke) led\nthe Aquitainians as far north as [Angoulême](/wiki/Angoul%C3%AAme\n\"Angoulême\"). Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and\nreturned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to\n[Bordeaux](/wiki/Bordeaux \"Bordeaux\"), where he set up a fort at Fronsac.\nHunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [Lupus II of\nGascony](/wiki/Lupo_II_of_Gascony \"Lupo II of Gascony\"). Lupus, fearing\nCharles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and was put in a monastery.\nGascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and\n[Gascony](/wiki/Duchy_of_Vasconia \"Duchy of Vasconia\") were finally fully\nsubdued by the Franks.\n\n### Perforce\nunion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Perforce union\")]\n\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother\nBertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [Tassilo III of\nBavaria](/wiki/Tassilo_III_of_Bavaria \"Tassilo III of Bavaria\") and married a\nLombard Princess (commonly known today as\n[Desiderata](/wiki/Desiderata,_wife_of_Charlemagne \"Desiderata, wife of\nCharlemagne\")), the daughter of King [Desiderius](/wiki/Desiderius\n\"Desiderius\"), to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [Pope Stephen\nIII](/wiki/Pope_Stephen_III \"Pope Stephen III\") first opposed the marriage\nwith the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard\nalliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and\nmarried a 13-year-old Swabian named\n[Hildegard](/wiki/Hildegard,_wife_of_Charlemagne \"Hildegard, wife of\nCharlemagne\"). The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at\n[Pavia](/wiki/Pavia \"Pavia\"). Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would\nhave gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open\nhostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771,\napparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow\n[Gerberga](/wiki/Gerberge,_wife_of_Carloman \"Gerberge, wife of Carloman\") fled\nto Desiderius' court in Lombardy with her sons for protection.\n\n## Italian\ncampaigns[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Italian campaigns\")]\n\n### Conquest of the Lombard\nkingdom[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Conquest of the Lombard kingdom\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Charlemagne_and_Pope_Adrian_I.jpg/220px-\nCharlemagne_and_Pope_Adrian_I.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charlemagne_and_Pope_Adrian_I.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charlemagne_and_Pope_Adrian_I.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic and maintained a close\nrelationship with the papacy throughout his life. In 772, when [Pope Adrian\nI](/wiki/Pope_Adrian_I \"Pope Adrian I\") was threatened by invaders, the king\nrushed to Rome to provide assistance. Shown here, the pope asks Charlemagne\nfor help at a meeting near Rome.\n\nAt his succession in 772, [Pope Adrian I](/wiki/Pope_Adrian_I \"Pope Adrian I\")\ndemanded the return of certain cities in the former [exarchate of\nRavenna](/wiki/Exarchate_of_Ravenna \"Exarchate of Ravenna\") in accordance with\na promise at the succession of Desiderius. Instead, Desiderius took over\ncertain papal cities and invaded the [Pentapolis](/wiki/Pentapolis\n\"Pentapolis\"), heading for Rome. Adrian sent ambassadors to Charlemagne in\nautumn requesting he enforce the policies of his father, Pepin. Desiderius\nsent his own ambassadors denying the pope's charges. The ambassadors met at\n[Thionville](/wiki/Thionville \"Thionville\"), and Charlemagne upheld the pope's\nside. Charlemagne demanded what the pope had requested, but Desiderius swore\nnever to comply. Charlemagne and his uncle\n[Bernard](/wiki/Bernhard,_son_of_Charles_Martel \"Bernhard, son of Charles\nMartel\") crossed the Alps in 773 and chased the Lombards back to [Pavia, which\nthey then besieged](/wiki/Siege_of_Pavia_\\(773%E2%80%9374\\) \"Siege of Pavia\n\\(773–74\\)\").[48] Charlemagne temporarily left the siege to deal with\n[Adelchis](/wiki/Adelchis \"Adelchis\"), son of Desiderius, who was raising an\narmy at [Verona](/wiki/Verona \"Verona\"). The young prince was chased to the\n[Adriatic](/wiki/Adriatic \"Adriatic\") littoral and fled to\n[Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople \"Constantinople\") to plead for\nassistance from [Constantine V](/wiki/Constantine_V \"Constantine V\"), who was\nwaging war with [Bulgaria](/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire \"First Bulgarian\nEmpire\").[49][30]\n\nThe siege lasted until the spring of 774, when Charlemagne visited the pope in\nRome. There he confirmed his father's grants of land,[50] with some later\nchronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting\n[Tuscany](/wiki/Tuscany \"Tuscany\"), [Emilia](/wiki/Emilia_\\(region_of_Italy\\)\n\"Emilia \\(region of Italy\\)\"), Venice and [Corsica](/wiki/Corsica \"Corsica\").\nThe pope granted him the title _[patrician](/wiki/Patrician_\\(post-\nRoman_Europe\\) \"Patrician \\(post-Roman Europe\\)\")_. He then returned to Pavia,\nwhere the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their\nlives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer.\nDesiderius was sent to the [abbey](/wiki/Abbey \"Abbey\") of\n[Corbie](/wiki/Corbie \"Corbie\"), and his son Adelchis died in\n[Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople \"Constantinople\"), a patrician. Charles,\nunusually, had himself crowned with the [Iron\nCrown](/wiki/Iron_Crown_of_Lombardy \"Iron Crown of Lombardy\") and made the\nmagnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [Arechis II of\nBenevento](/wiki/Arechis_II_of_Benevento \"Arechis II of Benevento\") refused to\nsubmit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as\nking of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few\nFrankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [Hrodgaud of\nFriuli](/wiki/Hrodgaud_of_Friuli \"Hrodgaud of Friuli\") and [Hildeprand of\nSpoleto](/wiki/Hildeprand_of_Spoleto \"Hildeprand of Spoleto\") rebelled.\nCharlemagne rushed back from [Saxony](/wiki/Saxony \"Saxony\") and defeated the\nduke of Friuli in battle; the duke was slain.[30] The duke of Spoleto signed a\ntreaty. Their co-conspirator, Arechis, was not subdued, and Adelchis, their\ncandidate in [Byzantium](/wiki/Byzantium \"Byzantium\"), never left that city.\nNorthern Italy was now faithfully his.\n\n### Southern\nItaly[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Southern Italy\")]\n\nIn 787, Charlemagne directed his attention towards the [Duchy of\nBenevento](/wiki/Duchy_of_Benevento \"Duchy of Benevento\"),[51] where [Arechis\nII](/wiki/Arechis_II_of_Benevento \"Arechis II of Benevento\") was reigning\nindependently with the self-given title of [Princeps](/wiki/Princeps\n\"Princeps\").

Tenth-century\ncopy of a lost original from about 830.\n\nDuring the first peace of any substantial length (780–782), Charles began to\nappoint his sons to positions of authority. In 781, he made his two youngest\nsons kings, crowned by the Pope. The elder of these two,\n[Carloman](/wiki/Pippin_of_Italy \"Pippin of Italy\"), was made [king of\nItaly](/wiki/King_of_Italy \"King of Italy\"), taking the Iron Crown that his\nfather had first worn in 774, and in the same ceremony was renamed\n\"Pepin\".[30][50] The younger of the two, [Louis](/wiki/Louis_the_Pious \"Louis\nthe Pious\"), became [king of Aquitaine](/wiki/King_of_Aquitaine \"King of\nAquitaine\"). Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs\nof their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their sub-\nkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit\ntheir realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he\nbanished his eldest, though possibly illegitimate, son, [Pippin the\nHunchback](/wiki/Pippin_the_Hunchback \"Pippin the Hunchback\"), to the\nmonastery of Prüm, because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters,\nas his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early\nage.[53] His children were also taught skills in accord with their\naristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his\nsons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.[54]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Charlemagne_et_Louis_le_Pieux.jpg/220px-\nCharlemagne_et_Louis_le_Pieux.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charlemagne_et_Louis_le_Pieux.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charlemagne_et_Louis_le_Pieux.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCharlemagne instructing his son [Louis the Pious](/wiki/Louis_the_Pious \"Louis\nthe Pious\")\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father.\n[Charles](/wiki/Charles_the_Younger \"Charles the Younger\") was mostly\npreoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at\nleast two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on\nmultiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the Böhmerwald (modern\n[Bohemia](/wiki/Bohemia \"Bohemia\")) to deal with the Slavs living there\n(Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [Czechs](/wiki/Czech_people \"Czech\npeople\")). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley\nof the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the\n[Avar](/wiki/Avars_\\(Carpathians\\) \"Avars \\(Carpathians\\)\") and Beneventan\nborders and fought the [Slavs](/wiki/Slavs \"Slavs\") to his north. He was\nuniquely poised to fight the [Byzantine Empire](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire\n\"Byzantine Empire\") when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial\ncoronation and a [Venetian](/wiki/Venetia_\\(region\\) \"Venetia \\(region\\)\")\nrebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [Spanish\nMarch](/wiki/Spanish_March \"Spanish March\") and fought the duke of Benevento\nin southern Italy on at least one occasion. He took\n[Barcelona](/wiki/Barcelona \"Barcelona\") in a great siege in 797.\n\nCharlemagne's attitude towards his daughters has been the subject of much\ndiscussion. He kept them at home with him and refused to allow them to\ncontract [sacramental marriages](/wiki/Marriage#Marriage_and_religion\n\"Marriage\") (though he originally condoned an engagement between his eldest\ndaughter Rotrude and [Constantine VI](/wiki/Constantine_VI \"Constantine VI\")\nof Byzantium, this engagement was annulled when Rotrude was 11).[55]\nCharlemagne's opposition to his daughters' marriages may possibly have\nintended to prevent the creation of [cadet branches](/wiki/Cadet_branch \"Cadet\nbranch\") of the family to challenge the main line, as had been the case with\n[Tassilo of Bavaria](/wiki/Tassilo_III_of_Bavaria \"Tassilo III of Bavaria\").\nHowever, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their\ncommon-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they\nproduced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their\nwild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the\ncourt by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents\nthey had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a\nrecognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [Angilbert](/wiki/Angilbert\n\"Angilbert\"), a member of Charlemagne's court circle.[56][57]\n\n## Carolingian expansion to the\nsouth[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit\nsection: Carolingian expansion to the south\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) | This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

He took refuge with the\nally duke [Lupus II of Gascony](/wiki/Lupus_II_of_Gascony \"Lupus II of\nGascony\"), but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, handed him over\nto the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to\nconfirm the peace in [the Basque area](/wiki/Duchy_of_Vasconia \"Duchy of\nVasconia\") south of the [Garonne](/wiki/Garonne \"Garonne\").\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain duke\nLupus's power by appointing [Seguin](/wiki/Seguin_I_of_Gascony \"Seguin I of\nGascony\") as count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background\nin bordering areas\n([Toulouse](/wiki/History_of_Toulouse#768.E2.80.93877:_Carolingian_Franks_and_the_Kingdom_of_Aquitaine\n\"History of Toulouse\"), [County of Fézensac](/wiki/County_of_F%C3%A9zensac\n\"County of Fézensac\")). The\n[Basque](/wiki/History_of_the_Basque_people#Early_Middle_Ages \"History of the\nBasque people\") duke in turn seems to have contributed decisively or schemed\nthe [Battle of Roncevaux Pass](/wiki/Battle_of_Roncevaux_Pass \"Battle of\nRoncevaux Pass\") (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of\nCharlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule\ndirectly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [Louis the\nPious](/wiki/Louis_the_Pious \"Louis the Pious\")) based on a power base of\nFrankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands\nto the Church, which he took as ally. A Christianisation programme was put in\nplace across the high [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees \"Pyrenees\") (778).\n\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords.\nAs of 788 [Adalric](/wiki/Adalric_of_Gascony \"Adalric of Gascony\") was\nfighting and capturing [Chorson](/wiki/Torson_of_Toulouse \"Torson of\nToulouse\"), Carolingian count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but\nCharlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed\nhis trustee [William of Gellone](/wiki/William_of_Gellone \"William of\nGellone\"). William in turn fought the Basques and defeated them after\nbanishing Adalric (790).\n\nFrom 781 ([Pallars](/wiki/County_of_Pallars \"County of Pallars\"),\n[Ribagorça](/wiki/County_of_Ribagorza \"County of Ribagorza\")) to 806\n([Pamplona](/wiki/Pamplona#Early_Middle_Ages \"Pamplona\") under Frankish\ninfluence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne\nasserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western\nmarches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern\nPyrenees that were to make up the [Marca Hispanica](/wiki/Marca_Hispanica\n\"Marca Hispanica\"). As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko\n(_al-Galashki_ , 'the Gaul') ruled [Álava](/wiki/%C3%81lava \"Álava\"), but\nPamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the\ncounties in the Marca Hispánica provided the necessary base to attack the\n[Andalusians](/wiki/Al-Andalus \"Al-Andalus\") (an expedition led by [William\nCount of Toulouse](/wiki/William_of_Gellone \"William of Gellone\") and Louis\nthe Pious to capture Barcelona in 801).

Seeing an opportunity to extend\n[Christendom](/wiki/Christendom \"Christendom\") and his own power and believing\nthe Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees\n\"Pyrenees\"), while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the\nEastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the\nhomage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the\ncity did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of\nhis career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home, since he\ncould not trust the [Basques](/wiki/Basques \"Basques\"), whom he had subdued by\nconquering [Pamplona](/wiki/Pamplona \"Pamplona\"). He turned to leave Iberia,\nbut as he was passing through the Pass of [Roncesvalles](/wiki/Roncesvalles\n\"Roncesvalles\") one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The\nBasques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [Battle of\nRoncevaux Pass](/wiki/Battle_of_Roncevaux_Pass \"Battle of Roncevaux Pass\"),\nthough less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the\n[seneschal](/wiki/Seneschal \"Seneschal\") Eggihard, the count of the palace\nAnselm, and the [warden](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/warden \"wikt:warden\")\nof the [Breton March](/wiki/Breton_March \"Breton March\"),\n[Roland](/wiki/Roland \"Roland\"), inspiring the subsequent creation of the\n[Song of Roland](/wiki/Song_of_Roland \"Song of Roland\") (_La Chanson de\nRoland_).\n\n### Contact with the\nSaracens[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit\nsection: Contact with the Saracens\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Harun-\nCharlemagne.jpg/300px-Harun-Charlemagne.jpg)](/wiki/File:Harun-\nCharlemagne.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Harun al-Rashid](/wiki/Harun_al-Rashid \"Harun al-Rashid\") receiving a\ndelegation of Charlemagne in [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\"), by [Julius\nKöckert](/w/index.php?title=Julius_K%C3%B6ckert&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Julius\nKöckert \\(page does not exist\\)\") (1864).\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the\n[Saracens](/wiki/Saracen \"Saracen\") who, at the time, controlled the\n[Mediterranean](/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea \"Mediterranean Sea\"). Pippin was much\noccupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [Corsica](/wiki/Corsica\n\"Corsica\") and [Sardinia](/wiki/Sardinia \"Sardinia\") at an unknown date and in\n799 the [Balearic Islands](/wiki/Balearic_Islands \"Balearic Islands\").

Charlemagne even\nhad contact with the [caliphal](/wiki/Caliph \"Caliph\") court in\n[Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\"). In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of\nBaghdad, [Harun al-Rashid](/wiki/Harun_al-Rashid \"Harun al-Rashid\"), presented\nCharlemagne with an [Asian elephant](/wiki/Asian_elephant \"Asian elephant\")\nnamed [Abul-Abbas](/wiki/Abul-Abbas \"Abul-Abbas\") and a [clock](/wiki/Clock\n\"Clock\").[58]\n\n### Wars with the\nMoors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit\nsection: Wars with the Moors\")]\n\nIn [Hispania](/wiki/Hispania \"Hispania\"), the struggle against the Moors\ncontinued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in\ncharge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and\nextended Frankish control into the [Catalan](/wiki/Catalonia \"Catalonia\")\nlittoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally\nFrankish until the [Treaty of Corbeil](/wiki/Treaty_of_Corbeil_\\(1258\\)\n\"Treaty of Corbeil \\(1258\\)\") in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of\n[Islamic Spain](/wiki/Al-Andalus \"Al-Andalus\") were constantly rebelling\nagainst Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The\nFrankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona,\n[Cardona](/wiki/Cardona,_Spain \"Cardona, Spain\"), [Ausona](/wiki/Ausona\n\"Ausona\") and [Urgell](/wiki/County_of_Urgell \"County of Urgell\") were united\ninto the new [Spanish March](/wiki/Spanish_March \"Spanish March\"), within the\nold duchy of [Septimania](/wiki/Septimania \"Septimania\").\n\nIn 797, [Barcelona](/wiki/Barcelona \"Barcelona\"), the greatest city of the\nregion, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova\nand, failing, handed it to them. The [Umayyad](/wiki/Umayyad \"Umayyad\")\nauthority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire\narmy of his kingdom over the [Pyrenees](/wiki/Pyrenees \"Pyrenees\") and\nbesieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it\ncapitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the\n[emir](/wiki/Emir \"Emir\"). They took [Tarragona](/wiki/Tarragona \"Tarragona\")\nin 809 and [Tortosa](/wiki/Tortosa \"Tortosa\") in 811.

In\nthe [Saxon Wars](/wiki/Saxon_Wars \"Saxon Wars\"), spanning thirty years and\neighteen battles, he conquered [Saxonia](/wiki/Old_Saxony \"Old Saxony\") and\nproceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [Germanic](/wiki/Germanic_peoples \"Germanic peoples\")\n[Saxons](/wiki/Saxons \"Saxons\") were divided into four subgroups in four\nregions. Nearest to [Austrasia](/wiki/Austrasia \"Austrasia\") was\n[Westphalia](/wiki/Westphalia \"Westphalia\") and furthest away was\n[Eastphalia](/wiki/Eastphalia \"Eastphalia\"). Between them was\n[Engria](/wiki/Engria \"Engria\") and north of these three, at the base of the\n[Jutland](/wiki/Jutland \"Jutland\") peninsula, was\n[Nordalbingia](/wiki/Nordalbingia \"Nordalbingia\").\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and\ncut down an [Irminsul](/wiki/Irminsul \"Irminsul\") pillar near\n[Paderborn](/wiki/Paderborn \"Paderborn\").[60] The campaign was cut short by\nhis first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia\nand conquering the Saxon fort at [Sigiburg](/wiki/Sigiburg \"Sigiburg\"). He\nthen crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in\nEastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader\n[Hessi](/w/index.php?title=Hessi&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Hessi \\(page does not\nexist\\)\") converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia,\nleaving encampments at Sigiburg and [Eresburg](/wiki/Eresburg \"Eresburg\"),\nwhich had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the\nexception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne\nreturned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his\nfortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main\nleader, [Widukind](/wiki/Widukind \"Widukind\"), escaped to Denmark, his wife's\nhome. Charlemagne built a new camp at [Karlstadt](/wiki/Karlstadt_am_Main\n\"Karlstadt am Main\"). In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to\nintegrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as\nChristians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia,\nEngria and Westphalia. At a diet near [Lippe](/wiki/Lippe \"Lippe\"), he divided\nthe land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass\nbaptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons\ndid not immediately revolt.

This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind\nreturned and led a new revolt. In response, at [Verden](/wiki/Verden,_Germany\n\"Verden, Germany\") in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered\nthe execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners, known as the [Massacre of\nVerden](/wiki/Massacre_of_Verden \"Massacre of Verden\") (\"Verdener\nBlutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare\n(783–785). During this war the [Frisians](/wiki/Frisians \"Frisians\") were\nfinally subdued and a large part of their fleet was burned. The war ended with\n[Widukind](/wiki/Widukind \"Widukind\") accepting baptism.\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792\nWestphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in\n793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian\nrebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons\nand [Slavs](/wiki/Slavic_peoples \"Slavic peoples\") quickly crushed it.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other\nmatters until 790, when he marched down the [Danube](/wiki/Danube \"Danube\")\nand ravaged Avar territory to the [Győr](/wiki/Gy%C5%91r \"Győr\").

Pippin and Duke [Eric of Friuli](/wiki/Eric_of_Friuli\n\"Eric of Friuli\") continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped\nstrongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken\ntwice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [Aachen](/wiki/Aachen\n\"Aachen\"), and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including\nKing [Offa of Mercia](/wiki/Offa_of_Mercia \"Offa of Mercia\"). Soon the Avar\n[tuduns](/wiki/Tudun \"Tudun\") had lost the will to fight and travelled to\nAachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne\naccepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to\nAvaria with the ancient title of [khagan](/wiki/Khagan \"Khagan\"). Abraham kept\nhis people in line, but in 800, the [Bulgarians](/wiki/First_Bulgarian_Empire\n\"First Bulgarian Empire\") under [Khan Krum](/wiki/Krum \"Krum\") attacked the\nremains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [Pannonia](/wiki/Pannonia\n\"Pannonia\"), defeating and bringing an end to the [Avar\nconfederation](/wiki/Avar_Khaganate \"Avar Khaganate\").[64]\n\nIn November of the same year, Charlemagne went to Regensburg where the Avar\nleaders acknowledged him as their ruler.[64] In 805, the Avar khagan, who had\nalready been baptised, went to Aachen to ask permission to settle with his\npeople south-eastward from [Vienna](/wiki/Vienna \"Vienna\").[64] The\n[Transdanubian](/wiki/Transdanubia \"Transdanubia\") territories became integral\nparts of the Frankish realm, which was abolished by the\n[Magyars](/wiki/Magyars \"Magyars\") in 899-900.\n\n### Northeast Slav\nexpeditions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit\nsection: Northeast Slav expeditions\")]\n\nIn 789, in recognition of his new pagan neighbours, the\n[Slavs](/wiki/Slavic_peoples \"Slavic peoples\"), Charlemagne marched an\nAustrasian-Saxon army across the [Elbe](/wiki/Elbe \"Elbe\") into\n[Obotrite](/wiki/Obotrite \"Obotrite\") territory. The Slavs ultimately\nsubmitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender\nof the [Wiltzes](/wiki/Wiltzes \"Wiltzes\") under Dragovit and demanded many\nhostages. He also demanded the permission to send missionaries into this pagan\nregion unmolested. The army marched to the [Baltic](/wiki/Baltic_region\n\"Baltic region\") before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much\nbooty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795,\nwhen the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Wiltzes rebelled with their\nnew ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged\nhim by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his\nmen to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to\nCharlemagne, who honoured him.

While\nfighting the Avars, the Franks had called for their support.[66] During the\n790s, he won a major victory over them in 796.[67] Pannonian Croat duke\n[Vojnomir of Pannonian Croatia](/wiki/Vojnomir_of_Pannonian_Croatia \"Vojnomir\nof Pannonian Croatia\") aided Charlemagne, and the Franks made themselves\noverlords over the Croats of northern Dalmatia, [Slavonia](/wiki/Slavonia\n\"Slavonia\") and Pannonia.[67]\n\nThe Frankish commander [Eric of Friuli](/wiki/Eric_of_Friuli \"Eric of Friuli\")\nwanted to extend his dominion by conquering the Littoral Croat Duchy. During\nthat time, Dalmatian Croatia was ruled by duke [Višeslav of\nCroatia](/wiki/Vi%C5%A1eslav_of_Croatia \"Višeslav of Croatia\"). In the [Battle\nof Trsat](/wiki/Siege_of_Trsat \"Siege of Trsat\"), the forces of Eric fled\ntheir positions and were routed by the forces of Višeslav.[68] Eric was among\nthose killed which was a great blow for the Carolingian Empire.[65][68][69]\n\nCharlemagne also directed his attention to the [Slavs](/wiki/South_Slavs\n\"South Slavs\") to the west of the Avar khaganate: the\n[Carantanians](/wiki/Carantania \"Carantania\") and [Carniolans](/wiki/Carniola\n\"Carniola\").

The Franks took pride in having \"fought against\nand thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the\nknowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of\nthe holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild\nanimals\", as [Pippin III](/wiki/Pepin_the_Short \"Pepin the Short\") described\nit in a law of 763 or 764.[78]\n\nFurthermore, the new title—carrying with it the risk that the new emperor\nwould \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of\ngovernment\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean\nconcerns more generally\"—risked alienating the Frankish leadership.[79]\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant\npower in European politics at this time. The Hellenic [Eastern\nEmpire](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire \"Byzantine Empire\"), based in\n[Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople \"Constantinople\"), continued to hold a\nsubstantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome.

According to\nthe latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was\nlimited in the same way as that of every other ruler; and when he made more\nfar-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of\nthe Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin\nof the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than\nby overarching theories.[87]\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time it had been the custom of Byzantium to\ndesignate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Byzantines. What might\nhave been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting\nto the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman\nemperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, in reality was no\ngreater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he\nhad entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge\nfinds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the\ninscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect\nCharles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the\nimperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating\nthat Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge\npoints out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only\nsurviving son, Louis, as emperor without recourse to Rome with only the\nacclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was\nFrankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome\nand a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.[88]\n\n### Imperial\ntitle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit\nsection: Imperial title\")]\n\nCharlemagne used these circumstances to claim that he was the renewer of the\nRoman Empire, which had declined under the [Byzantines](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire\n\"Byzantine Empire\"). In his official charters, Charles preferred the style\n_Karolus serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus magnus pacificus imperator\nRomanum gubernans imperium_[89] (\"Charles, most serene Augustus crowned by\nGod, the great, peaceful emperor ruling the Roman empire\") to the more direct\n_Imperator Romanorum_ (\"Emperor of the Romans\").\n\nThe title of Emperor remained in the Carolingian family for years to come, but\ndivisions of territory and in-fighting over supremacy of the Frankish state\nweakened its significance.[90] The papacy itself never forgot the title nor\nabandoned the right to bestow it. When the family of Charles ceased to produce\nworthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best\nprotect him from his local enemies. The empire would remain in continuous\nexistence for nearly a millennium, as the Holy Roman Empire, a true imperial\nsuccessor to Charles.[91]\n\n### Imperial\ndiplomacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit\nsection: Imperial diplomacy\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Europe_in_814%2C_Charlemagne%2C_Krum%2C_Nicephorus_I.png/300px-\nEurope_in_814%2C_Charlemagne%2C_Krum%2C_Nicephorus_I.png)](/wiki/File:Europe_in_814,_Charlemagne,_Krum,_Nicephorus_I.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Europe_in_814,_Charlemagne,_Krum,_Nicephorus_I.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nEurope around 814\n\nThe [iconoclasm of the Byzantine](/wiki/Iconoclasm_\\(Byzantine\\) \"Iconoclasm\n\\(Byzantine\\)\") [Isaurian Dynasty](/wiki/Leo_III_the_Isaurian \"Leo III the\nIsaurian\") was endorsed by the Franks.[92] The [Second Council of\nNicaea](/wiki/Second_Council_of_Nicaea \"Second Council of Nicaea\")\nreintroduced the veneration of icons under Empress\n[Irene](/wiki/Byzantine_Empress_Irene \"Byzantine Empress Irene\"). The council\nwas not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been\ninvited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the old\nRoman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And\nwhile the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he\npolitically digressed from Byzantium.[92] He certainly desired to increase the\ninfluence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the\nconstitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when\nRome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the\nimperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It\nwas, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and\nher successor [Nikephoros I](/wiki/Nikephoros_I \"Nikephoros I\")—neither of\nwhom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe Byzantines, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what\nwas left of the [Exarchate of Ravenna](/wiki/Exarchate_of_Ravenna \"Exarchate\nof Ravenna\")), [Reggio](/wiki/Reggio_Calabria \"Reggio Calabria\") (in\n[Calabria](/wiki/Calabria \"Calabria\")), [Brindisi](/wiki/Brindisi \"Brindisi\")\n(in [Apulia](/wiki/Apulia \"Apulia\")), and [Naples](/wiki/Naples \"Naples\") (the\n_[Ducatus Neapolitanus](/wiki/Ducatus_Neapolitanus \"Ducatus Neapolitanus\")_).\nThese regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the\nVenetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown\nof Pippin, Charles' son.

The conflict\nlasted until 810, when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back\nto the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace:\nCharlemagne received the [Istrian](/wiki/Istria \"Istria\") peninsula and in 812\nthe emperor [Michael I Rangabe](/wiki/Michael_I_Rangabe \"Michael I Rangabe\")\nrecognised his status as Emperor,[93] although not necessarily as \"Emperor of\nthe Romans\".[94]\n\n### Danish\nattacks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit\nsection: Danish attacks\")]\n\nAfter the conquest of Nordalbingia, the Frankish frontier was brought into\ncontact with Scandinavia.

There Charlemagne crowned his son as co-emperor\nand sent him back to Aquitaine. He then spent the autumn hunting before\nreturning to Aachen on 1 November. In January, he fell ill with\n[pleurisy](/wiki/Pleurisy \"Pleurisy\").[95] In deep depression (mostly because\nmany of his plans were not yet realised), he took to his bed on 21 January and\nas [Einhard](/wiki/Einhard \"Einhard\") tells it:\n\n> He died January twenty-eighth, the seventh day from the time that he took to\n> his bed, at nine o'clock in the morning, after partaking of the [Holy\n> Communion](/wiki/Holy_Communion \"Holy Communion\"), in the seventy-second\n> year of his age and the forty-seventh of his reign.\n\nHe was buried that same day, in [Aachen Cathedral](/wiki/Aachen_Cathedral\n\"Aachen Cathedral\"), although the cold weather and the nature of his illness\nmade such a hurried burial unnecessary. The earliest surviving\n_[planctus](/wiki/Planctus \"Planctus\")_ , the _[Planctus de obitu\nKaroli](/wiki/Planctus_de_obitu_Karoli \"Planctus de obitu Karoli\")_ , was\ncomposed by a monk of [Bobbio](/wiki/Bobbio_Abbey \"Bobbio Abbey\"), which he\nhad patronised.[96] A later story, told by Otho of Lomello, Count of the\nPalace at Aachen in the time of [Otto III](/wiki/Otto_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\n\"Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor\"), would claim that he and Emperor Otto had\ndiscovered Charlemagne's tomb: the emperor, they claimed, was seated upon a\nthrone, wearing a crown and holding a sceptre, his flesh almost entirely\nincorrupt. In 1165, [Frederick I](/wiki/Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\n\"Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor\") re-opened the tomb again and placed the\nemperor in a sarcophagus beneath the floor of the cathedral.[97] In 1215\n[Frederick II](/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Frederick II, Holy\nRoman Emperor\") re-interred him in a casket made of gold and silver.\n\nCharlemagne's death emotionally affected many of his subjects, particularly\nthose of the literary clique who had surrounded him at [Aachen](/wiki/Aachen\n\"Aachen\"). An anonymous monk of Bobbio lamented:[98]\n\n> From the lands where the sun rises to western shores, people are crying and\n> wailing ... the Franks, the Romans, all Christians, are stung with mourning\n> and great worry ... the young and old, glorious nobles, all lament the loss\n> of their Caesar ... the world laments the death of Charles ... O Christ, you\n> who govern the heavenly host, grant a peaceful place to Charles in your\n> kingdom. Alas for miserable me.\n\nLouis succeeded him as Charles had intended. He left a\n[testament](/wiki/The_Testament_of_Charlemagne \"The Testament of Charlemagne\")\nallocating his assets in 811 that was not updated prior to his death. His\nempire lasted only another generation in its entirety; its division, according\nto custom, between Louis's own sons after their father's death laid the\nfoundation for the modern states of Germany and France.[99]\n\n## Administration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Administration\")]\n\nAs an administrator, Charlemagne stands out for his many reforms:\n[monetary](/wiki/Monetary \"Monetary\"), governmental, military, cultural and\n[ecclesiastical](/wiki/Ecclesiastic \"Ecclesiastic\"). He is the main\nprotagonist of the \"Carolingian Renaissance\".\n\n### Military[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=36\n\"Edit section: Military\")]\n\nCharlemagne's success rested primarily on novel [siege](/wiki/Siege \"Siege\")\ntechnologies and excellent logistics[100] rather than the long-claimed\n\"[cavalry](/wiki/Heavy_cavalry \"Heavy cavalry\") revolution\" led by [Charles\nMartel](/wiki/Charles_Martel \"Charles Martel\") in 730s. However, the\n[stirrup](/wiki/Stirrup \"Stirrup\"), which made the \"shock cavalry\"\n[lance](/wiki/Lance \"Lance\") charge possible, was not introduced to the\nFrankish kingdom until the late eighth century.[101]\n\nHorses were used extensively by the Frankish military, because horses provided\na quick, long-distance method of [transporting troops](/wiki/Mounted_infantry\n\"Mounted infantry\"), which was critical to building and maintaining the large\nempire.[101]\n\n### Economic and monetary\nreforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=37 \"Edit\nsection: Economic and monetary reforms\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Karldergrossesignatur.svg/400px-\nKarldergrossesignatur.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Karldergrossesignatur.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Karldergrossesignatur.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Monogram](/wiki/Monogram \"Monogram\") of Charlemagne, including [signum\nmanus](/wiki/Signum_manus \"Signum manus\"), from the subscription of a royal\ndiploma: _Signum_ (monogr.: KAROLVS) _Karoli gloriosissimi regis_\n\nCharlemagne had an important role in determining Europe's immediate economic\nfuture. Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary\nsystem based on the gold _[sou](/wiki/Solidus_\\(coin\\) \"Solidus \\(coin\\)\")_.\nInstead he and the [Anglo-Saxon King](/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_monarchs \"Anglo-Saxon\nmonarchs\") [Offa of Mercia](/wiki/Offa_of_Mercia \"Offa of Mercia\") took up\nPippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with\nByzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing\ntheir trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically\nharmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at\nthe commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the _[livre\ncarolinienne](/wiki/French_livre \"French livre\")_ (from the Latin\n_[libra](/wiki/Ancient_Roman_units_of_measurement \"Ancient Roman units of\nmeasurement\")_ , the modern [pound](/wiki/Pound_\\(currency\\) \"Pound\n\\(currency\\)\")), which was based upon a pound of silver—a unit of both money\nand weight—worth 20 sous (from the Latin _[solidus](/wiki/Solidus_\\(coin\\)\n\"Solidus \\(coin\\)\")_ [which was primarily an accounting device and never\nactually minted], the modern [shilling](/wiki/Shilling \"Shilling\")) or 240\n_[deniers](/wiki/Denier_\\(coin\\) \"Denier \\(coin\\)\")_ (from the Latin\n_[denarius](/wiki/Denarius \"Denarius\")_ , the modern [penny](/wiki/Penny\n\"Penny\")). During this period, the _livre_ and the _sou_ were counting units;\nonly the _denier_ was a coin of the realm.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Charlemagne_denier_Tours_793_to_812.jpg/170px-\nCharlemagne_denier_Tours_793_to_812.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charlemagne_denier_Tours_793_to_812.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charlemagne_denier_Tours_793_to_812.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDenier from the era of Charlemagne, [Tours](/wiki/Tours \"Tours\"), 793–812\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [accounting practice](/wiki/Accountancy\n\"Accountancy\") by means of the [Capitulare de\nvillis](/wiki/Capitulare_de_villis \"Capitulare de villis\") of 802, which laid\ndown strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be\nrecorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's\nstandard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's\ndeath, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the\ncontinued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n### Jews in Charlemagne's\nrealm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=38 \"Edit\nsection: Jews in Charlemagne's realm\")]\n\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money\nlending. Then lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814, because it\nviolated Church law. Charlemagne introduced the _[Capitulary for the\nJews](/wiki/Capitulary_for_the_Jews \"Capitulary for the Jews\")_ , a\nprohibition on Jews engaging in money-lending due to the religious convictions\nof the majority of his constituents, in essence banning it across the board, a\nreversal of his earlier recorded general policy.[102] In addition to this\nbroad change, Charlemagne also performed a significant number of microeconomic\nreforms, such as direct control of prices and levies on certain goods and\ncommodities.\n\nHis _Capitulary for the Jews_ , however, was not representative of his overall\neconomic relationship or attitude towards the Frankish Jews, and certainly not\nhis earlier relationship with them, which evolved over his life. His personal\nphysician for example was Jewish,[103] he employed at least one Jew for\ndiplomatic missions and[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Isaac was his personal representative to the\nMuslim caliphate of Baghdad. Letters have been credited to him that invited\nJews to settle in his kingdom.[104][105][106]\n\n### Education\nreforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=39 \"Edit\nsection: Education reforms\")]\n\nPart of Charlemagne's success as a warrior, an administrator and ruler can be\ntraced to his admiration for learning and education. His reign are often\nreferred to as the [Carolingian Renaissance](/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance\n\"Carolingian Renaissance\") because of the flowering of scholarship,\nliterature, art and architecture that characterise it. Charlemagne came into\ncontact with the culture and learning of other countries (especially Moorish\nSpain, Anglo-Saxon England,[107] and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests.\nHe greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres\nfor book-copying) in Francia.\n\nMost of the presently surviving works of classical Latin were copied and\npreserved by Carolingian scholars. Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available\nfor many ancient texts are Carolingian. It is almost certain that a text which\nsurvived to the Carolingian age survives still.\n\nThe pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins\nof many of the men who worked for him: [Alcuin](/wiki/Alcuin \"Alcuin\"), an\n[Anglo-Saxon](/wiki/Anglo-Saxons \"Anglo-Saxons\") from [York](/wiki/York\n\"York\"); [Theodulf](/wiki/Theodulf \"Theodulf\"), a [Visigoth](/wiki/Visigoths\n\"Visigoths\"), probably from [Septimania](/wiki/Septimania \"Septimania\"); [Paul\nthe Deacon](/wiki/Paul_the_Deacon \"Paul the Deacon\"), Lombard;\n[Italians](/wiki/Italians \"Italians\") [Peter of Pisa](/wiki/Peter_of_Pisa\n\"Peter of Pisa\") and [Paulinus of Aquileia](/wiki/Saint_Paulinus_II \"Saint\nPaulinus II\"); and Franks [Angilbert](/wiki/Angilbert \"Angilbert\"), Angilram,\n[Einhard](/wiki/Einhard \"Einhard\") and [Waldo of\nReichenau](/wiki/Waldo_of_Reichenau \"Waldo of Reichenau\").\n\nCharlemagne promoted the [liberal arts](/wiki/Liberal_arts \"Liberal arts\") at\ncourt, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even\nstudying himself (in a time when even leaders who promoted education did not\ntake time to learn themselves) under the tutelage of Peter of Pisa, from whom\nhe learned grammar; Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialectic (logic),\nand astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars);\nand Einhard, who tutored him in arithmetic.[108]\n\nHis great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write:\nwhen in his old age he attempted to learn—practising the formation of letters\nin his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his\npillow—\"his effort came too late in life and achieved little success\", and his\nability to read – which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary\nsource supports—has also been called into question.[108]\n\nIn 800, Charlemagne enlarged the hostel at the [Muristan](/wiki/Muristan\n\"Muristan\") in [Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem \"Jerusalem\") and added a library to\nit. He certainly had not been personally in Jerusalem.[109][110]\n\n### Church\nreforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=40 \"Edit\nsection: Church reforms\")]\n\nSee also: [Charlemagne and church music](/wiki/Charlemagne_and_church_music\n\"Charlemagne and church music\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Aachen_Cathedral_top_floor.jpg/220px-\nAachen_Cathedral_top_floor.jpg)](/wiki/File:Aachen_Cathedral_top_floor.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Aachen_Cathedral_top_floor.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Charlemagne's chapel](/wiki/Palatine_Chapel_in_Aachen \"Palatine Chapel in\nAachen\") at [Aachen Cathedral](/wiki/Aachen_Cathedral \"Aachen Cathedral\").\n\nUnlike his father, Pippin, and uncle, Carloman, Charlemagne expanded the\nreform Church's programme. The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be\nseen as central to public policy and royal governance. His reform focused on\nstrengthening the church's power structure, improving clergy's skill and moral\nquality, standardising liturgical practices, improvements on the basic tenets\nof the faith and the rooting out of paganism. His authority extended over\nchurch and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property\nand define orthodox doctrine. Despite the harsh legislation and sudden change,\nhe had developed support from clergy who approved his desire to deepen the\npiety and morals of his subjects.[111]\n\nIn 809–810, Charlemagne called a church council in [Aachen](/wiki/Aachen\n\"Aachen\"), which confirmed the unanimous belief in the West that the Holy\nSpirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (_ex\nPatre[Filioque](/wiki/Filioque \"Filioque\")_) and sanctioned inclusion in the\n[Nicene Creed](/wiki/Nicene_Creed \"Nicene Creed\") of the phrase _Filioque_\n(and the Son). For this Charlemagne sought the approval of [Pope Leo\nIII](/wiki/Pope_Leo_III \"Pope Leo III\"). The Pope, while affirming the\ndoctrine and approving its use in teaching, opposed its inclusion in the text\nof the Creed as adopted in the 381 [First Council of\nConstantinople](/wiki/First_Council_of_Constantinople \"First Council of\nConstantinople\"). This spoke of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the\nFather, without adding phrases such as \"and the Son\", \"through the Son\", or\n\"alone\". Stressing his opposition, the Pope had the original text inscribed in\nGreek and Latin on two heavy shields that were displayed in [Saint Peter's\nBasilica](/wiki/Saint_Peter%27s_Basilica \"Saint Peter's\nBasilica\").[112][113][114]\n\n### Writing\nreforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=41 \"Edit\nsection: Writing reforms\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Codexaureus_04.jpg/170px-\nCodexaureus_04.jpg)](/wiki/File:Codexaureus_04.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Codexaureus_04.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPage from the [Lorsch Gospels](/wiki/Lorsch_Gospels \"Lorsch Gospels\") of\nCharlemagne's reign\n\nDuring Charles' reign, the [Roman half uncial](/wiki/Uncial \"Uncial\") script\nand its cursive version, which had given rise to various continental\n[minuscule](/wiki/Minuscule_cursive \"Minuscule cursive\") scripts, were\ncombined with features from the [insular scripts](/wiki/Insular_script\n\"Insular script\") in use in Irish and English monasteries. [Carolingian\nminuscule](/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule \"Carolingian minuscule\") was created\npartly under the patronage of Charlemagne. [Alcuin](/wiki/Alcuin \"Alcuin\"),\nwho ran the palace school and [scriptorium](/wiki/Scriptorium \"Scriptorium\")\nat Aachen, was probably a chief influence.\n\nThe revolutionary character of the Carolingian reform, however, can be over-\nemphasised; efforts at taming Merovingian and Germanic influence had been\nunderway before Alcuin arrived at Aachen. The new minuscule was disseminated\nfirst from Aachen and later from the influential scriptorium at\n[Tours](/wiki/Tours \"Tours\"), where Alcuin retired as an abbot.\n\n### Political\nreforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=42 \"Edit\nsection: Political reforms\")]\n\nCharlemagne engaged in many reforms of Frankish governance, while continuing\nmany traditional practices, such as the division of the kingdom among\nsons.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\n#### Organisation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: Organisation\")]\n\nMain article: [Government of the Carolingian\nEmpire](/wiki/Government_of_the_Carolingian_Empire \"Government of the\nCarolingian Empire\")\n\nThe Carolingian king exercised the _[bannum](/wiki/Bannum \"Bannum\")_ , the\nright to rule and command. He had supreme jurisdiction in judicial matters,\nmade legislation, led the army, and protected both the Church and the poor.\nHis administration was an attempt to organise the kingdom, church and nobility\naround him. However, the effort was heavily dependent upon the efficiency,\nloyalty, and support of his subjects.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n#### Divisio\nregnorum[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=44 \"Edit\nsection: Divisio regnorum\")]\n\nIn 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the\nempire on his death. For Charles the Younger he designated Austrasia and\nNeustria, Saxony, Burgundy and [Thuringia](/wiki/Thuringia \"Thuringia\"). To\nPippin he gave Italy, Bavaria and [Swabia](/wiki/Swabia \"Swabia\"). Louis\nreceived Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [Provence](/wiki/Provence\n\"Provence\"). The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion\nthat, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary\nachievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the\nmatter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of\nthe Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon\nCharlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not\npromised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's\nillegitimate son [Bernard](/wiki/Bernard_of_Italy \"Bernard of\nItaly\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Personality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=45\n\"Edit section: Personality\")]\n\n### Manner[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=46 \"Edit\nsection: Manner\")]\n\nEinhard tells in his twenty-fourth chapter:\n\n> Charles was temperate in eating, and particularly so in drinking, for he\n> abominated drunkenness in anybody, much more in himself and those of his\n> household; but he could not easily abstain from food, and often complained\n> that fasts injured his health.

When he was not working, he loved\nChristian books, horseback riding, swimming, bathing in natural hot springs\nwith his friends and family, and hunting.[115] Franks were well known for\nhorsemanship and hunting skills.[115] Charles was a light sleeper and would\nstay in his bed chambers for entire days at a time due to restless nights.\nDuring these days, he would not get out of bed when a quarrel occurred in his\nkingdom. Instead of handling business in a professional manner, he called all\nmembers of the situation into his bedroom to be given orders. Einhard tells\nagain in the twenty fourth chapter: \"In summer after the midday meal, he would\neat some fruit, drain a single cup, put off his clothes and shoes, just as he\ndid for the night, and rest for two or three hours. He was in the habit of\nawaking and rising from bed four or five times during the night.\"[115]\n\n### Language[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=47\n\"Edit section: Language\")]\n\nMain article: [Theodiscus](/wiki/Theodiscus \"Theodiscus\")\n\nBy Charlemagne's time the French vernacular had already diverged significantly\nfrom Latin. This is evidenced by one of the regulations of the [Council of\nTours](/wiki/Council_of_Tours \"Council of Tours\") (813), which required that\nparish priests preach either in the \"rusticam Romanam linguam\" (Romance) or\n\"Theotiscam\" (the Germanic vernacular) rather than in Latin. The goal of this\nrule was to make sermons comprehensible to the common people.[116] Charlemagne\nhimself probably spoke a Rhenish [Franconian](/wiki/Franconian_languages\n\"Franconian languages\") dialect.[117][118][119]\n\nHe also spoke [Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") and had at least some understanding\nof Greek, according to Einhard (_Grecam vero melius intellegere quam\npronuntiare poterat_ , \"he could understand Greek better than he could speak\nit\").[120]\n\nThe largely fictional account of Charlemagne's Iberian campaigns by [Pseudo-\nTurpin](/wiki/Pseudo-Turpin \"Pseudo-Turpin\"), written some three centuries\nafter his death, gave rise to the legend that the king also spoke\n[Arabic](/wiki/Arabic \"Arabic\").[121]\n\n### Appearance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=48\n\"Edit section: Appearance\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Charles_Marville%2C_H%C3%B4tel_Carnavalet%2C_statue_of_Charlemagne%2C_ca._1853%E2%80%9370.jpg/220px-\nCharles_Marville%2C_H%C3%B4tel_Carnavalet%2C_statue_of_Charlemagne%2C_ca._1853%E2%80%9370.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charles_Marville,_H%C3%B4tel_Carnavalet,_statue_of_Charlemagne,_ca._1853%E2%80%9370.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charles_Marville,_H%C3%B4tel_Carnavalet,_statue_of_Charlemagne,_ca._1853%E2%80%9370.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Carolingian-era [equestrian\nstatuette](/wiki/Equestrian_statuette_of_Charlemagne \"Equestrian statuette of\nCharlemagne\") thought to represent Charlemagne (from [Metz\nCathedral](/wiki/Metz_Cathedral \"Metz Cathedral\"), now in the Louvre)\n\nCharlemagne's personal appearance is known from a good description by Einhard\nafter his death in the biography _[Vita Karoli Magni](/wiki/Vita_Karoli_Magni\n\"Vita Karoli Magni\")_.

He was thought to enjoy the works of St. Augustine.[142] His court\nplayed a key role in producing books that taught elementary Latin and\ndifferent aspects of the church. It also played a part in creating a royal\nlibrary that contained in-depth works on language and Christian faith.[143]\n\nCharlemagne encouraged clerics to translate Christian creeds and prayers into\ntheir respective vernaculars as well to teach grammar and music. Due to the\nincreased interest of intellectual pursuits and the urging of their king, the\nmonks accomplished so much copying that almost every manuscript from that time\nwas preserved. At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were\nproducing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art,\nmusic, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private\nlibraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen\nwho could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was\nfounded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by\nCharlemagne.[144][131] Book production was completed slowly by hand, and took\nplace mainly in large monastic libraries. Books were so in demand during\nCharlemagne's time that these libraries lent out some books, but only if that\nborrower offered valuable collateral in return.[131] Most books, however, were\n[held by chains](/wiki/Chained_library \"Chained library\") in order to\ndiscourage theft. This made it difficult for multiple students to study one\ntitle, but helped ensure the safety of the tomes.\n\nAlcuin was a proponent of education and wrote thoughtfully on Christian\nreligion.[142] Considered the greatest scholar of his day, he became the\nking's confidant and adviser. He brought his interest in libraries to the\nking's court. He was also a tutor to the king and his sons, teaching them\nliberal arts, theology and astrology.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=60 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [![The Metropolitan M Stamp.PNG](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/The_Metropolitan_M_Stamp.PNG/28px-The_Metropolitan_M_Stamp.PNG)](/wiki/File:The_Metropolitan_M_Stamp.PNG) [Middle Ages portal](/wiki/Portal:Middle_Ages \"Portal:Middle Ages\")\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Charlemagne&action=edit&section=61 \"Edit\nsection: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** In [Latin](/wiki/Latin_language \"Latin language\"): _Karolus_ or _Carolus_ , whence Charles.

Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [Pierre Riché](/w/index.php?title=Pierre_Rich%C3%A9&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Pierre Riché \\(page does not exist\\)\") (_The Carolingians_ , p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter Hägemann (_Karl der Große. Herrscher des Abendlands_ , p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [Friedelehe](/wiki/Friedelehe \"Friedelehe\"), a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (_The Emperor Charlemagne_ , p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.\n  129. **Jump up ^** \"By [Hildigard] Charlemagne had four sons and four daughters, according to Paul the Deacon: one son, the twin of Lewis, called Lothar, died as a baby and is not mentioned by Einhard; two daughters, Hildigard and Adelhaid, died as babies, so that Einhard appears to err in one of his names, unless there were really five daughters.\" Thorpe, Lewis, _Two Lives of Charlemagne_ , p.185\n  130. **Jump up ^** Church historians of the period wrote universally in Latin, regardless of native language.
