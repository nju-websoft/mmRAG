The Cavs\nplayed there their first four seasons. It was replaced in 1974 by the\n20,273-seat [Richfield Coliseum](/wiki/Richfield_Coliseum \"Richfield\nColiseum\"), located in [Richfield](/wiki/Richfield,_Ohio \"Richfield, Ohio\"),\nbetween Cleveland and [Akron](/wiki/Akron,_Ohio \"Akron, Ohio\").[6]\n\nDuring the 1980s, the site of the Central Market, a fruit and vegetable market\nthat dated back to 1856, was selected for construction of a multi-purpose\ndomed stadium for the [Cleveland Browns](/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland\nBrowns\") and [Cleveland Indians](/wiki/Cleveland_Indians \"Cleveland Indians\"),\nbut the ballot measure to fund it was defeated by voters. The market site was\nacquired in 1985 and cleared in 1987 in a continued push for new downtown\nsports facilities by city and business leaders.

Around the seating there are two main concourses, one on the ground\nlevel to access the 100 level seating and 32 lower suites, and an upper\nconcourse for the top 200 level seating. The lower concourse also includes the\nticket office and the two-level main team shop. In between is the club level,\nwhich provides access to the 60 upper suites and club seating.

The sign was approved by the Cleveland\nCity Planning Commission in March 2016 with the stipulation that only the\narena's name or its naming rights sponsor can be shown. Any other use of the\nsign needs commission approval.
