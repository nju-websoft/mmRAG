I've never met him.\nWe were doing the voice for the second one and I still hadn't seen the first\none. I still didn't really know who the characters were and I didn't know what\nanything was. It's a voice job, for sure, and people assume I've spent my life\nworking on it, but I really know so little about it.\"[8] In 2012, Weaving said\nto _[Collider](/wiki/Collider_\\(website\\) \"Collider \\(website\\)\")_ : \"It was\none of the only things I've ever done where I had no knowledge of it, I didn't\ncare about it, I didn't think about it. They wanted me to do it. In one way, I\nregret that bit. I don't regret doing it, but I very rarely do something if\nit's meaningless. It was meaningless to me, honestly. I don't mean that in any\nnasty way.\"\n\nWeaving played a supporting role in [Joe Johnston](/wiki/Joe_Johnston \"Joe\nJohnston\")'s 2010 remake of the 1941 film _[The\nWolfman](/wiki/The_Wolfman_\\(2010_film\\) \"The Wolfman \\(2010 film\\)\")_ ,\nstarring [Benicio del Toro](/wiki/Benicio_del_Toro \"Benicio del Toro\").\nImmediately after _Wolfman_ wrapped in spring 2008, he returned home to\nAustralia to film a lead role in the film _[Last\nRide](/wiki/Last_Ride_\\(film\\) \"Last Ride \\(film\\)\")_ , directed by Glendyn\nIvin.
