Along with\n[Picasso](/wiki/Picasso \"Picasso\")'s _[Les Demoiselles\nd'Avignon](/wiki/Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\")_,\n_Le bonheur de vivre_ is regarded as one of the pillars of early\n[modernism](/wiki/Modernism \"Modernism\").[1] The monumental canvas was first\nexhibited at the [Salon des Indépendants](/wiki/Salon_des_Ind%C3%A9pendants\n\"Salon des Indépendants\") of 1906, where its cadmium colors and spatial\ndistortions caused a public expression of protest and outrage.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Description\n  * 2 Inspiration\n  * 3 Conservation\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n##\nDescription[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Le_bonheur_de_vivre&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Description\")]\n\nIn the central background of the piece is a group of figures that is similar\nto the group depicted in his painting _[The\nDance](/wiki/The_Dance_\\(second_version\\) \"The Dance \\(second version\\)\")_\n(1909–10). In the picture, there are several nude bodies of women and men in a\nlandscape drenched with vivid color.\n\n##\nInspiration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Le_bonheur_de_vivre&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Inspiration\")]\n\n\"The work is known to have invigorated fellow artists, especially [Pablo\nPicasso](/wiki/Pablo_Picasso \"Pablo Picasso\"), who, in an effort to outdo\nMatisse in terms of shock value, immediately began work on his watershed _Les\nDemoiselles D’Avignon_ \", writes Martha Lucy, associate curator at the Barnes\nFoundation.[1]\n\nJames B. Cuno and Thomas Puttfarken suggest that the inspiration for the work\nwas [Agostino Carracci](/wiki/Agostino_Carracci \"Agostino Carracci\")'s\nengraving of [_Reciproco Amore_ or _Love in the Golden\nAge_](/wiki/File:Agostino_Carracci_-\n_Reciproco_Amore_or_Love_in_the_Golden_Age.jpg \"File:Agostino Carracci -\nReciproco Amore or Love in the Golden Age.jpg\") after the [similarly named\npainting](/wiki/File:Pauwels_Franck_-_%22Amori%22-_Reciproco_amore_\\(Et%C3%A1_dell%27oro\\).jpg\n\"File:Pauwels Franck - \"Amori\"- Reciproco amore \\(Etá dell'oro\\).jpg\") by the\n16th-century Flemish painter [Paolo Fiammingo](/wiki/Paolo_Fiammingo \"Paolo\nFiammingo\"). Based on the many similarities with the engraving, in particular\nits theme of pastoral fantasy and its composition with the circle of dancers\nin the background, Cuno came to the conclusion that Carracci's engraving had a\ndecisive influence on the final composition of _Le Bonheur de Vivre_.[2][3][4]\n\nAccording to [Hilton Kramer](/wiki/Hilton_Kramer \"Hilton Kramer\") _Le bonheur\nde vivre_ , owing to its long sequestration in the collection of the [Barnes\nFoundation](/wiki/Barnes_Foundation \"Barnes Foundation\") which never permitted\nits reproduction in color, is the least familiar of modern masterpieces. Yet\nthis painting was Matisse's own response to the hostility his work had met\nwith in the [Salon d'Automne](/wiki/Salon_d%27Automne \"Salon d'Automne\") of\n1905, a response that entrenched his art even more deeply in the esthetic\nprinciples that had governed his [Fauvist](/wiki/Fauvist \"Fauvist\") paintings\nwhich had caused a furor and which did so on a far grander scale, too.\"[5]\n(The \"sequestration\" Kramer referred to relates to the very limited hours of\nthe museum, when its collection was located in suburban [Merion](/wiki/Merion\n\"Merion\"), [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"); in 2012, the\ncollection was moved to a new, more accessible facility in downtown\n[Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\").)\n\n##\nConservation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Le_bonheur_de_vivre&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Conservation\")]\n\n_Le bonheur de vivre_ features a large amount of cadmium sulfide-based yellow.\nPortions of the painting containing cadmium sulfide are turning white or\nbrown, degrading the work. [University of\nDelaware](/wiki/University_of_Delaware \"University of Delaware\") Prof. Robert\nL. Opila, in collaboration with Barbara Buckley, head of conservation at the\nBarnes, and Jennifer Mass, a senior scientist and head of the Scientific\nResearch and Analysis Laboratory at Winterthur, studied the paint’s material\nmicrostructure in an attempt to determine why the cadmium sulfide is changing\ncolor.[1][6]\n\n“It is a very disheartening phenomenon, considering the painting’s position in\nhistory,” says Opila, professor of materials science at UD.[1][6]\n\nPreliminary tests carried out by UD doctoral student Jonathan Church at the\nEuropean Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, show that\ncarbon dioxide is reacting with the cadmium sulfide, causing the formation of\ncadmium carbonate, which is white. Also, the presence of chloride in the paint\nappears to be acting as a catalyst for the deterioration. Opila and his\nresearch team theorize that the binder, an oil similar to linseed oil, may be\nturning brown.[1][6]\n\n“The scientific studies being undertaken will contribute significantly to the\npreservation of the painting and to our understanding of the change that has\ntaken place to the visual appearance of the painting,” says Buckley.[1][6]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Le_bonheur_de_vivre&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ [Martha Lucy, _Matisse Mystery_ , the Barnes Foundation](http://www.barnesfoundation.org/about/press/coverage/matisse-mystery)\n  2. **Jump up ^** James B.
