Meyer,\nher agent, and her editor all liked the character so much that they decided to\ngive him a larger role in the following book, _[New\nMoon](/wiki/New_Moon_\\(novel\\) \"New Moon \\(novel\\)\")_ , with Meyer referring\nto the character as, \"my favorite gift that _New Moon_ gave to me.\"[1]\n\n> \"Jacob was my first experience with a character taking over—a minor\n> character developing such roundness and life that I couldn't keep him locked\n> inside a tiny role....From the very beginning, even when Jacob only appeared\n> in chapter six of _Twilight_ , he was so _alive_. I liked him. More than I\n> should for such a small part.\"\n\nMeyer has said that after Jacob started emerging as a prominent character in\n_New Moon_.\n\n## Role in the\nbooks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Black&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Role in the books\")]\n\n### _Twilight\nSaga_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Black&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Twilight Saga\")]\n\nJacob is given a small role in [the first book](/wiki/Twilight_\\(novel\\)\n\"Twilight \\(novel\\)\") of the series. He is introduced as the son of [Billy\nBlack](/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters \"List of Twilight characters\"), an\nold Swan family friend. When Bella uses him to get information on [Edward\nCullen](/wiki/Edward_Cullen \"Edward Cullen\") and his family, Jacob tells her\nQuileute legends and introduces her to the idea that Edward is a\n[vampire](/wiki/Vampire_\\(Twilight\\) \"Vampire \\(Twilight\\)\"). Bella comes to\nlike Jacob, and he develops a crush on her.[2]\n\n### _New Moon_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Black&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: New Moon\")]\n\nIn _[New Moon](/wiki/New_Moon_\\(novel\\) \"New Moon \\(novel\\)\")_ , Jacob's\ncharacter is used as a device to help Bella emerge from her months-long\ndepression, brought on by her distress over Edward's departure. The friendship\nbetween the two characters grows strong, but Jacob also develops romantic\nfeelings for Bella that she does not reciprocate. It is revealed that, as a\nmember of the Quileute tribe, Jacob is descended from an ancient line of\n\"[shapeshifters](/wiki/Shapeshifting \"Shapeshifting\")\" that assume wolf form.\nIn their backstory, the Quileutes and vampires are mortal enemies. When Jacob\nundergoes his first transformation into a wolf in front of Bella, it is in\nresponse to Paul, one of the pack members who becomes enraged when he was\nslapped by Bella, causing him to phase and attempt to attack her. Jacob rushes\noutside to defend Bella, and he jumps high over her and phases in midair.\nJacob rushes at Paul first and bites and pushes him. Jacob is shown in this\nscene to be very talented even when this was his first transformation at\nattacking and countering Paul as he is able to hit him before he has a chance\nto attack. A scene shows him tackling Paul causing him to crash into a boat\nrack. He and Paul later arrive at Emily Young's house and Paul apologizes to\nBella. Soon, he becomes busy patrolling the forest with his pack, searching\nfor vampires in the area. When Bella is caught by the vampire\n[Laurent](/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Laurent \"List of Twilight\ncharacters\") alone in a clearing, she is saved by Jacob and the wolf pack, who\nchase and kill Laurent. Sam first emerges from the woods, Laurent noticing\nmore emerge runs away. Sam closes in on him but is struck back by Laurent just\nbefore he was about to tackle him. He later claims that Laurent was nothing\nbut a simple kill. During the chase, Laurent is cornered by part of the pack\nwhile Jacob goes for the kill. Jacob and his friends are able to cover a range\nof 1.67 miles in just 1 minute meaning they are able to run at nearly or close\nto 100 mph at full run.\n\nJacob serves as a rescue for Bella and a foil to Edward on multiple occasions\nin the narrative. When Bella, who has taken increasingly dangerous risks to\nfeel closer to Edward, impulsively jumps off a cliff and almost drowns, Jacob\nrescues her. After Edward mistakenly believes she has died and plans to kill\nhimself, Bella and [Alice\nCullen](/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Alice_Cullen \"List of Twilight\ncharacters\"), rush to Italy to prevent his suicide, leaving Jacob heartbroken.\nJacob is disgusted by Edward's return and by Bella's willingness to take\nEdward back after he left her. Jacob reminds Edward of his tribe's treaty with\nthe Cullen family, which states that the Cullens are not allowed to bite\nhumans. Bella interrupts and points out to Jacob that she wants to become a\nvampire, and it's her own decision. This angers Jacob, and he attempts to\nstart a fight with Edward. Edward decides to leave with Bella, but Jacob grabs\nhim and says: \"You don't speak for her.\" causing Edward to uppercut punch him\ninto the air, causing him to transform. Edward and Jacob are stopped\nimmediately by Bella as she says: \"You can't harm each other without harming\nme.\" Jacob, now feeling full of guilt and knowing that he would not harm her\ndue to him still having a tremendous crush on her and her being his best and\nclosest friend, decides to accept her wish, but he is feeling hurt by her\ndecision which causes him to run away.[3]\n\n### _Eclipse_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Black&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Eclipse\")]\n\nIn _[Eclipse](/wiki/Eclipse_\\(Meyer_novel\\) \"Eclipse \\(Meyer novel\\)\")_ ,\nJacob, enraged that Bella plans to become a vampire, attempts to distance\nhimself by not returning her phone calls and refusing to see her. Later,\nduring the scene when Jacob visits Bella and Edward to discuss the vampire\nVictoria's return, he tells Bella that he misses her and wishes that they\ncould remain friends. With Edward's approval, Bella begins to visit Jacob on a\nregular basis. On one of these visits, Jacob tells Bella that he is in love\nwith her and that he wants her to choose him over Edward. Bella is caught off\nguard by his confession and tells him she only thinks of him as a friend. He\nforcibly kisses her, and she reacts by punching him in the face. This breaks\nher hand, though it does not affect Jacob because he is a werewolf and doesn't\nget hurt easily. This act later enrages Edward, and the two get into a heated\nargument in front of Bella's house. They come extremely close to a physical\nfight, until Bella pushes Edward always and pleads for them to stop. Edward,\nstill fuming with rage, tells Jacob that if Bella gives him the word, he will\nharm him. Bella's father comes outside at that moment, and demands to know\nwhat's going on. Jacob admits that he kissed Bella, and she broke her hand\npunching him. Jacob apologizes and leaves.\n\nLater on, Jacob's shapeshifter wolf pack and the Cullen family join forces to\ndefeat Victoria and the army of newborn vampires she has created. The wolf\npack have agreed to meet at their house. They are in their wolf form as they\ndon't trust the Cullen's enough to be in their human form as they possibly\nbelieve this to be a plot to destroy the pack. Carlisle greets them and tells\nhow they should accurately and successfully attack a newborn. Sam\ntelepathically asks what a newborn is and what the difference is between them\nand the newborn. He tells them that the newborns are a fresh breed of vampires\nthat were humans forcibly turned with a combination of both human and vampire\nstrength with most of their human element relying on intelligence. Carlisle\ntells them that they should never let a single one get their arms around them\nas they are strong enough to crush their bodies. He also says that they should\nnever go for the \"obvious\" kill as they can get outnumbered easily and lose\nmost of the pack. As the Cullen's demonstrate their tactics to the wolves on\nhow they deal with newborns, Jacob also in his wolf form comes up to Bella. He\nnudges close to her as he still has a crush on her. She tells Jacob that if\nthey join this attack many of them could get hurt or even killed. In response\nJacob places his head in front of her and she pets him. Suddenly Edwards sees\nthis and Jacob looks at him with a disgusted and annoyed look and walks off.\nThe night before the battle, Edward and Jacob are alone with Bella on the top\nof a mountain. They are there, in a secluded spot, to protect her from\nVictoria and her blood-hungry army. It is night, and a blizzard beats at their\ntent. Bella is freezing to death, huddled in a blanket hold and shivering\nviolently. Edward watches on with despair, as he can do nothing to help\nbecause his vampire skin is ice-cold. Jacob, being a werewolf, is never cold\nand has very a warm body. Because of his enhanced senses he can hear Bella's\nteeth chattering as he claims that he \"can't sleep with all that teeth\nchattering going on.\" He moves forward to lay down with Bella, knowing his\nbody heat would keep her warm. Edward shoves him away, outraged, and says he\nwill not go near her. Jacob demands that Edward lets him go. Bella, hardly\nconscious, pleads for them not to fight. Jacob insists that Bella needs his\nwarmth, and reluctantly Edward lets him crawl into the blankets with her. She\ncuddles into his warmth, still hardly conscious. Bella stops shaking and\nchattering. She falls asleep in his arms. While she is sleeping, Edward and\nJacob begin to talk quietly. As the night wears on, their private conversation\nsoftens and the two become closer.\n\nRight before the battle the next morning, Jacob overhears Edward and Bella\ndiscussing their engagement. He did not know about this, because Bella was\ntrying to keep it a secret until the battle was over, for she knew he'd be\nreckless with his anger. Jacob is outraged, and refuses to believe that Bella\ntruly loves Edward more than him. He threatens suicide by hoping he'd be\nkilled in the battle. He is about to run off to join the soon-to-be-battle.\nBella, in an attempt to stop him from getting killed, demands to be kissed by\nhim. Jacob doesn't hesitate, and he kisses her passionately. Then, he leaves\nfor the battle and Bella feels relieved to know that he no longer wants to be\nkilled while fighting. After he is gone, she comes to the realization that she\ndoes love Jacob.\n\nIn the battle, Jacob fights ferociously and savagely. He is in his wolf form\nas is the rest of the pack. He kills many vampires and together, with the\nCullens, they defeat Victoria's newborn army. The battle is over, but one\nnewborn vampire who had remained hidden the whole time, emerges from hiding.\nLeah, one of the wolves, immediately attacks. The enemy vampire wraps his arms\naround her neck and tries to strangle her, but Jacob lunges forward and knocks\nhim off. They engage in a brief but vicious fight. Jacob falls and the vampire\ncrushes his body with violent force. At once the vampire is pulled off by the\nother wolves and killed. Jacob is now back in human form. He is writhing on\nthe ground naked and in extreme agony. Carlisle, the doctor vampire, announces\nthat the bones in the right half of his body are crushed. The other wolves,\nnow back in their human form too, stare in horror as Carlisle continues to\ninspect him. He tells the others that Jacob is healing from but at an\nextremely low rate and says that he needs to re-align Jacobs bones in order to\nspeed up his healing. Leah is full of guilt and shame, and insists that she\n\"had him\" [the vampire]. Sam tells her to shut up. Sam suggested that they\nbring Jacob back to Billy's house so he start helping Jacob. Then, they haul\nJacob off the ground and carry him off.\n\nAt Jacob's house, Bella overhears Jacob screaming in pain as Carlisle re-\naligns him. One of the pack tells Bella that Carlisle is doing this to speed\nup Jacobs healing. He is in bed with a high fever. Bella is worried and\napologizes to him, wishing he'll get better soon. She also admits that it was\na mistake to kiss him, and tries to tell him that even if she does love him,\nhe has to accept that it is Edward who truly lies in her heart. Then she\nleaves, and Jacob his angered and deeply hurt.\n\nThe epilogue is written from Jacob's point of view; angry and heartbroken at\nBella's decision to become a vampire. He runs away in his wolf form to escape\nhis pain.[4]\n\n### _Breaking\nDawn_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Black&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Breaking Dawn\")]\n\nJacob returns after an absence of several weeks to attend Bella and Edward's\nwedding in _[Breaking Dawn](/wiki/Breaking_Dawn \"Breaking Dawn\")_. Though\ndescribed as being still visibly pained by her decision, he tells Bella that\nhe wants her to be happy. Bella tells him that she and Edward plan to have a\nnormal honeymoon before she becomes a vampire. Jacob becomes enraged, because\nhe knows that Edward's vampire strength could kill her. Sam and the rest of\nthe pack stop him before he phases into wolf form and gets into a fight with\nEdward.\n\nWhen Bella and Edward return from their honeymoon, Jacob becomes the narrator\nof the story for several chapters, during which he learns that she is pregnant\nwith Edward's half-human, half-vampire baby and is extremely ill. When Jacob\ninforms the pack of Bella's pregnancy, their leader [Sam\nUley](/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Sam_Uley \"List of Twilight\ncharacters\") plans an attack on the Cullens in order to kill Bella and her\nunborn child because of the threat he believes the child presents. Jacob, who\nfeels that the Cullens are innocent, fights back against Sam and leaves the\npack. Fulfilling his birthright as Alpha wolf, he is joined in a new pack by\n[Seth](/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Seth_Clearwater \"List of Twilight\ncharacters\") and [Leah\nClearwater](/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Leah_Clearwater \"List of\nTwilight characters\"), who aid Jacob in protecting the Cullens. After the\nbirth of [Renesmee Carlie\nCullen](/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Renesmee_Cullen \"List of Twilight\ncharacters\"), Edward and Bella's daughter, Jacob \"imprints\" \\- an involuntary\nresponse in which a wolf finds his soulmate - on her. Afterward, Jacob is\ncompletely over Bella, and they remain close friends. The relationship between\nJacob and the Cullens is also dispelled, and he and Edward come to view each\nother as friends after Jacob emotionally bonds with Renesmee.[5]\n\n##\nCharacterization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Black&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Characterization\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-\nnew.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg)|\nThis section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

He has\nequivalent abilities to his brothers. He is shown to be very intelligent in\nboth reasoning and coordinating others. He is the largest and strongest wolf\nin the pack.\n\nHuman form: In the first film, Jacob has a very skinny physique that undergoes\nmajor physical changes by the second film. Being a werewolf, Jacob develops a\nmassive physique. He is able to lift heavy objects that no human is capable of\npicking up. For example, a dirt bike he easily picked up from his father's\ntruck. After becoming a wolf, he cuts off his long hair and gets the Quileute\ntattoo on his upper right arm.\n\n### Personality and\nabilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Black&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Personality and abilities\")]\n\nBella describes Jacob as a \"happy person\" who extends his happiness to the\npeople around him. As Jacob's character emerges in _New Moon_ , he is shown to\nbe cheery, passionate, and adventurous, but hot-headed. Jacob is also able to\nshape-shift at will into a giant wolf, and sometimes when angered he will\ninvoluntarily phase. His body temperature is warmer than a human's body should\nbe, reaching about 108.9 °F (42.7 °C), which allows him to withstand very cold\nweather. In human form, his body [heals](/wiki/Regeneration_\\(biology\\)\n\"Regeneration \\(biology\\)\") within seconds, he possesses [superhuman\nstrength](/wiki/Superhuman_strength \"Superhuman strength\") and speed, has a\nhigh [durability](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/durability \"wikt:durability\")\nrate, sharp [senses](/wiki/Senses \"Senses\") and [free\nrunning](/wiki/Free_running \"Free running\") abilities. In wolf form he can\ncommunicate with his wolf pack [telepathically](/wiki/Telepathically\n\"Telepathically\"), has enhanced [superhuman\nstrength](/wiki/Superhuman_strength \"Superhuman strength\") and speed and a\nsubstantial size increase. While in wolf form, his teeth can cut through the\n_granite-hard_ bodies of a\n[vampire](/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Vampires \"List of Twilight\ncharacters\") with ease.

Once they begin phasing, a\nQuileute shape-shifter may \"imprint\" \\- a method of finding one's soulmate -\non someone, and will act as whatever the imprintee wants or needs, whether it\nbe an older brother, friend, protector, or lover. Jacob imprints on Edward and\nBella's newborn daughter, Renesmee in _Breaking Dawn_.\n\nWhile treating Jacob in _Eclipse_ , Carlisle takes a blood sample and runs\nsome tests on it. He discovers that he has 24 pairs of chromosomes, one more\nthan a human. A distinction is made in _Breaking Dawn_ between the [old\nworld](/wiki/Old_world \"Old world\") [Children of the Moon](/wiki/Lycanthropy\n\"Lycanthropy\") (\"true werewolves\") and this [shape-shifting](/wiki/Shape-\nshifting \"Shape-shifting\") Quileute tribe. The former are held to be a more\nferocious and territorial type, with a transformative venomous bite and who\ninvoluntarily phase as do [traditional werewolves](/wiki/Werewolf \"Werewolf\")\non the full moon. The latter are implied as being blessed with the\nsupernatural ability to shapeshift into other [giant animals](/wiki/Shamanism\n\"Shamanism\") or \"spirits of nature\".\n\n## Film portrayal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Black&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Film portrayal\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Taylor_Lautner_H%C3%B4tel_de_Crillon_2009.jpg/220px-\nTaylor_Lautner_H%C3%B4tel_de_Crillon_2009.jpg)](/wiki/File:Taylor_Lautner_H%C3%B4tel_de_Crillon_2009.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Taylor_Lautner_H%C3%B4tel_de_Crillon_2009.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTaylor Lautner\n\n[Taylor Lautner](/wiki/Taylor_Lautner \"Taylor Lautner\") played the part of\nJacob Black in the film adaptation of\n[_Twilight_](/wiki/Twilight_\\(2008_film\\) \"Twilight \\(2008 film\\)\").[6] Due to\nmajor physical changes in the character of Jacob between _Twilight_ and _New\nMoon_ , director [Chris Weitz](/wiki/Chris_Weitz \"Chris Weitz\") considered\nreplacing Lautner in the sequel with an actor who could more accurately\nportray \"the new, larger Jacob Black.\"[7] In an attempt to keep the role,\nLautner stated, \"I have been working out.
