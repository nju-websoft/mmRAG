DO NOT POWER IT\nDOWN!!\"\n\nIn [computing](/wiki/Computing \"Computing\"), a **server** is a [computer\nprogram](/wiki/Computer_program \"Computer program\") or a\n[device](/wiki/Computer \"Computer\") that provides functionality for other\nprograms or devices, called \"[clients](/wiki/Client_\\(computing\\) \"Client\n\\(computing\\)\")\". This [architecture](/wiki/Systems_architecture \"Systems\narchitecture\") is called the [client–server\nmodel](/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model \"Client–server model\"), and a single\noverall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices.\nServers can provide various functionalities, often called \"services\", such as\nsharing data or [resources](/wiki/System_resource \"System resource\") among\nmultiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can\nserve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client\nprocess may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server\non a different device.[1] Typical servers are [database\nservers](/wiki/Database_server \"Database server\"), [file\nservers](/wiki/File_server \"File server\"), [mail servers](/wiki/Mail_server\n\"Mail server\"), [print servers](/wiki/Print_server \"Print server\"), [web\nservers](/wiki/Web_server \"Web server\"), [game servers](/wiki/Game_server\n\"Game server\"), and [application servers](/wiki/Application_server\n\"Application server\").[2]\n\nClient–server systems are today most frequently implemented by (and often\nidentified with) the [request–response](/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response\n\"Request–response\") model: a client sends a request to the server, which\nperforms some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a\nresult or acknowledgement. Designating a computer as \"server-class hardware\"\nimplies that it is specialized for running servers on it. This often implies\nthat it is more powerful and reliable than standard [personal\ncomputers](/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal computer\"), but alternatively,\nlarge [computing clusters](/wiki/Computing_cluster \"Computing cluster\") may be\ncomposed of many relatively simple, replaceable server components.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Operation\n  * 3 Purpose\n  * 4 Hardware requirement\n    * 4.1 Large servers\n    * 4.2 Clusters\n    * 4.3 Appliances\n  * 5 Operating systems\n  * 6 Energy consumption\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Further reading\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Server_\\(computing\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe use of the word _server_ in computing comes from [queueing\ntheory](/wiki/Queueing_theory \"Queueing theory\"),[3] where it dates to the mid\n20th century, being notably used in Kendall (1953) (along with \"service\"), the\npaper that introduced [Kendall's notation](/wiki/Kendall%27s_notation\n\"Kendall's notation\"). In earlier papers, such as the Erlang (1909), more\nconcrete terms such as \"[telephone] operators\" are used.\n\nIn computing, \"server\" dates at least to [RFC\n5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5) (1969),[4] one of the earliest documents\ndescribing [ARPANET](/wiki/ARPANET \"ARPANET\") (the predecessor of\n[Internet](/wiki/Internet \"Internet\")), and is contrasted with \"user\",\ndistinguishing two types of [host](/wiki/Host_\\(network\\) \"Host \\(network\\)\"):\n\"server-host\" and \"user-host\". The use of \"serving\" also dates to early\ndocuments, such as [RFC 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4),[5] contrasting\n\"serving-host\" with \"using-host\".\n\nThe [Jargon File](/wiki/Jargon_File \"Jargon File\") defines\n\"[server](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/server.html)\" in the common sense\nof a process performing service for requests, usually remote, with the 1981\n([1.1.0](http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg110.txt)) version reading:\n\n> SERVER n. A kind of [DAEMON](/wiki/Daemon_\\(computing\\) \"Daemon\n> \\(computing\\)\") which performs a service for the requester, which often runs\n> on a computer other than the one on which the server runs.\n\n##\nOperation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Server_\\(computing\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Operation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Server-based-\nnetwork.svg/220px-Server-based-network.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Server-based-\nnetwork.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Server-based-network.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA network based on the **[client–server\nmodel](/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model \"Client–server model\")** where\nmultiple individual _clients_ request services and resources from centralized\nservers\n\nStrictly speaking, the term _server_ refers to a [computer\nprogram](/wiki/Computer_program \"Computer program\") or\n[process](/wiki/Process_\\(computing\\) \"Process \\(computing\\)\") (running\nprogram). Through [metonymy](/wiki/Metonymy \"Metonymy\"), it refers to a device\nused for (or a device dedicated to) running one or several server programs. On\na network, such a device is called a _[host](/wiki/Host_\\(network\\) \"Host\n\\(network\\)\")_. In addition to _server_ , the words _serve_ and _service_ (as\nnoun and as verb) are frequently used, though _servicer_ and _servant_ are\nnot.[a] The word _service_ (noun) may refer to either the abstract form of\nfunctionality, e.g. [Web service](/wiki/Web_service \"Web service\").\nAlternatively, it may refer to a computer program that turns a computer into a\nserver, e.g. [Windows service](/wiki/Windows_service \"Windows service\").\nOriginally used as \"servers serve users\" (and \"users use servers\"), in the\nsense of \"obey\", today one often says that \"servers serve data\", in the same\nsense as \"give\". For instance, [web servers](/wiki/Web_server \"Web server\")\n\"serve [up] web pages to users\" or \"service their requests\".\n\nThe server is part of the [client–server\nmodel](/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model \"Client–server model\"); in this\nmodel, a server serves data for [clients](/wiki/Client_\\(computing\\) \"Client\n\\(computing\\)\"). The nature of communication between a client and server is\n[request and response](/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response \"Request–response\").\nThis is in contrast with [peer-to-peer](/wiki/Peer-to-peer \"Peer-to-peer\")\nmodel in which the relationship is on-demand reciprocation. In principle, any\ncomputerized process that can be used or called by another process\n(particularly remotely, particularly to share a resource) is a server, and the\ncalling process or processes is a client. Thus any general purpose computer\nconnected to a network can host servers. For example, if files on a device are\nshared by some process, that process is a [file server](/wiki/File_server\n\"File server\"). Similarly, [web server](/wiki/Web_server \"Web server\")\nsoftware can _run_ on any capable computer, and so a [laptop](/wiki/Laptop\n\"Laptop\") or a personal computer can host a web server.\n\nWhile request–response is the most common client–server design, there are\nothers, such as the [publish–subscribe\npattern](/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern \"Publish–subscribe pattern\").\nIn the publish–subscribe pattern, clients register with a pub–sub server,\nsubscribing to specified types of messages; this initial registration may be\ndone by request–response. Thereafter, the pub–sub server forwards matching\nmessages to the clients _without_ any further requests: the server\n_[pushes](/wiki/Push_technology \"Push technology\")_ messages to the client,\nrather than the client _[pulling](/wiki/Pull_technology \"Pull technology\")_\nmessages from the server as in request–response.[6]\n\nWhen referring to hardware, the word _server_ typically designates computer\nmodels specialized for their role. In general, a server performs its role\nbetter than a generic [personal computer](/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal\ncomputer\").\n\n##\nPurpose[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Server_\\(computing\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Purpose\")]\n\nMain category: [Servers (computing)](/wiki/Category:Servers_\\(computing\\)\n\"Category:Servers \\(computing\\)\")\n\nThe purpose of a server is to share data as well as to share\n[resources](/wiki/System_resource \"System resource\") and distribute work. A\nserver computer can serve its own computer programs as well; depending on the\nscenario, this could be part of a _[quid pro quo](/wiki/Quid_pro_quo \"Quid pro\nquo\")_ transaction, or simply a technical possibility. The following table\nshows several scenarios in which a server is used.\n\nServer type  | Purpose  | Clients   \n---|---|---  \n[Application server](/wiki/Application_server \"Application server\") | Hosts [web apps](/wiki/Web_app \"Web app\") (computer programs that run inside a [web browser](/wiki/Web_browser \"Web browser\")) allowing users in the network to run and use them, without having to install a copy on their own computers. Unlike what the name might imply, these servers need not be part of the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\"); any [local network](/wiki/Local_network \"Local network\") would do.  | Computers with a web browser   \n[Catalog server](/wiki/Catalog_server \"Catalog server\") | Maintains an index or table of contents of information that can be found across a large distributed network, such as computers, users, files shared on file servers, and web apps. [Directory servers](/wiki/Directory_server \"Directory server\") and [name servers](/wiki/Name_server \"Name server\") are examples of catalog servers.  | Any computer program that needs to find something on the network, such a [Domain member](/wiki/Windows_domain \"Windows domain\") attempting to log in, an [email client](/wiki/Email_client \"Email client\") looking for an email address, or a user looking for a file   \n[Communications server](/wiki/Communications_server \"Communications server\") | Maintains an environment needed for one communication endpoint (user or devices) to find other endpoints and communicate with them. It may or may not include a directory of communication endpoints and a presence detection service, depending on the openness and security parameters of the network  | Communication endpoints (users or devices)   \n[Computing server](/wiki/Supercomputer \"Supercomputer\") | Shares vast amounts of computing resources, especially [CPU](/wiki/Central_processing_unit \"Central processing unit\") and [random-access memory](/wiki/Random-access_memory \"Random-access memory\"), over a network.  | Any computer program that needs more CPU power and RAM than a personal computer can probably afford. The client must be a networked computer; otherwise, there would be no client–server model.   \n[Database server](/wiki/Database_server \"Database server\") | Maintains and shares any form of [database](/wiki/Database \"Database\") (organized collections of data with predefined properties that may be displayed in a table) over a network.  | [Spreadsheets](/wiki/Spreadsheet \"Spreadsheet\"), [accounting software](/wiki/Accounting_software \"Accounting software\"), [asset management software](/wiki/Digital_asset_management \"Digital asset management\") or virtually any computer program that consumes well-organized data, especially in large volumes   \n[Fax server](/wiki/Fax_server \"Fax server\") | Shares one or more [fax machines](/wiki/Fax_machine \"Fax machine\") over a network, thus eliminating the hassle of physical access  | Any fax sender or recipient   \n[File server](/wiki/File_server \"File server\") | Shares [files](/wiki/Computer_file \"Computer file\") and [folders](/wiki/Computer_folder \"Computer folder\"), storage space to hold files and folders, or both, over a network  | Networked computers are the intended clients, even though local programs can be clients   \n[Game server](/wiki/Game_server \"Game server\") | Enables several computers or gaming devices to play [multiplayer games](/wiki/Multiplayer_game \"Multiplayer game\") | Personal computers or [gaming consoles](/wiki/Video_game_console \"Video game console\")  \n[Mail server](/wiki/Mail_server \"Mail server\") | Makes [email](/wiki/Email \"Email\") communication possible in the same way that a [post office](/wiki/Post_office \"Post office\") makes [snail mail](/wiki/Snail_mail \"Snail mail\") communication possible  | Senders and recipients of email   \n[Media server](/wiki/Media_server \"Media server\") | Shares [digital video](/wiki/Digital_video \"Digital video\") or [digital audio](/wiki/Digital_audio \"Digital audio\") over a network through [media streaming](/wiki/Streaming_media \"Streaming media\") (transmitting content in a way that portions received can be watched or listened to as they arrive, as opposed to downloading an entire file and then using it)  | User-attended personal computers equipped with a monitor and a speaker   \n[Print server](/wiki/Print_server \"Print server\") | Shares one or more [printers](/wiki/Printer_\\(computing\\) \"Printer \\(computing\\)\") over a network, thus eliminating the hassle of physical access  | Computers in need of printing something   \n[Sound server](/wiki/Sound_server \"Sound server\") | Enables computer programs to play and record sound, individually or cooperatively  | Computer programs of the same computer and network clients.   \n[Proxy server](/wiki/Proxy_server \"Proxy server\") | Acts as an [intermediary](/wiki/Intermediary \"Intermediary\") between a client and a server, accepting incoming traffic from the client and sending it to the server. Reasons for doing so includes content control and filtering, improving traffic performance, preventing unauthorized network access or simply routing the traffic over a large and complex network.  | Any networked computer   \nVirtual server  | Shares hardware and software resources with other virtual servers. It exists only as defined within specialized software called hypervisor. The hypervisor presents virtual hardware to the server as if it were real physical hardware[7]. Server virtualization allows for a more efficient infrastructure.  | Any networked computer   \n[Web server](/wiki/Web_server \"Web server\") | Hosts [web pages](/wiki/Web_page \"Web page\"). A web server is what makes the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\") possible. Each [website](/wiki/Website \"Website\") has one or more web servers.  | Computers with a web browser   \n  \nAlmost the entire structure of the [Internet](/wiki/Internet \"Internet\") is\nbased upon a [client–server](/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server \"Client–server\")\nmodel. High-level [root nameservers](/wiki/Root_nameserver \"Root nameserver\"),\n[DNS](/wiki/Domain_Name_System \"Domain Name System\"), and routers direct the\ntraffic on the internet. There are millions of servers connected to the\nInternet, running continuously throughout the world[8] and virtually every\naction taken by an ordinary [Internet](/wiki/Internet \"Internet\") user\nrequires one or more interactions with one or more server. There are\nexceptions that do not use dedicated servers; for example [peer-to-peer file\nsharing](/wiki/File_sharing \"File sharing\"), some implementations of\n[telephony](/wiki/Telephony \"Telephony\") (e.g. pre-Microsoft\n[Skype](/wiki/Skype \"Skype\")).\n\n## Hardware\nrequirement[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Server_\\(computing\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Hardware requirement\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Inside_and_Rear_of_Webserver.jpg/220px-\nInside_and_Rear_of_Webserver.jpg)](/wiki/File:Inside_and_Rear_of_Webserver.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Inside_and_Rear_of_Webserver.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA rack-mountable server with the top cover removed to reveal internal\ncomponents\n\n[Hardware](/wiki/Computer_hardware \"Computer hardware\") requirement for\nservers vary widely, depending on the server's purpose and its software.\n\nSince servers are usually accessed over a network, many run unattended without\na [computer monitor](/wiki/Computer_monitor \"Computer monitor\") or input\ndevice, audio hardware and [USB](/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus \"Universal Serial\nBus\") interfaces. Many servers do not have a [graphical user\ninterface](/wiki/Graphical_user_interface \"Graphical user interface\") (GUI).\nThey are configured and managed remotely. Remote management can be conducted\nvia various methods including [Microsoft Management\nConsole](/wiki/Microsoft_Management_Console \"Microsoft Management Console\")\n(MMC), [PowerShell](/wiki/PowerShell \"PowerShell\"), [SSH](/wiki/Secure_Shell\n\"Secure Shell\") and [browser-based](/wiki/Web_browser \"Web browser\") [out-of-\nband management](/wiki/Out-of-band_management \"Out-of-band management\")\nsystems such as Dell's [iDRAC](/wiki/Dell_DRAC \"Dell DRAC\") or HP's\n[iLo](/wiki/HP_Integrated_Lights-Out \"HP Integrated Lights-Out\").\n\n### Large\nservers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Server_\\(computing\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Large servers\")]\n\nLarge traditional single servers would need to be run for long periods without\ninterruption. [Availability](/wiki/Availability \"Availability\") would have to\nbe very high, making hardware reliability and durability extremely important.\n[Mission-critical](/wiki/Mission-critical \"Mission-critical\") enterprise\nservers would be very [fault tolerant](/wiki/Fault_tolerance \"Fault\ntolerance\") and use specialized hardware with low [failure\nrates](/wiki/Failure_rate \"Failure rate\") in order to maximize\n[uptime](/wiki/Uptime \"Uptime\"). [Uninterruptible power\nsupplies](/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply \"Uninterruptible power supply\")\nmight be incorporated to insure against power failure. Servers typically\ninclude hardware [redundancy](/wiki/Redundancy_\\(engineering\\) \"Redundancy\n\\(engineering\\)\") such as dual [power supplies](/wiki/Power_supply \"Power\nsupply\"), [RAID](/wiki/RAID \"RAID\") [disk](/wiki/Hard_disk \"Hard disk\")\nsystems, and [ECC memory](/wiki/ECC_memory \"ECC memory\"),[9] along with\nextensive [pre-boot](/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment \"Preboot Execution\nEnvironment\") memory testing and verification. Critical components might be\n[hot swappable](/wiki/Hot_swappable \"Hot swappable\"), allowing technicians to\nreplace them on the running server without shutting it down, and to guard\nagainst overheating, servers might have more powerful fans or use [water\ncooling](/wiki/Water_cooling \"Water cooling\"). They will often be able to be\nconfigured, powered up and down or rebooted remotely, using [out-of-band\nmanagement](/wiki/Out-of-band_management \"Out-of-band management\"), typically\nbased on [IPMI](/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface \"Intelligent\nPlatform Management Interface\").
