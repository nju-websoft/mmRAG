The\n[mind–body problem](/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem \"Mind–body problem\") is a\nparadigm issue in philosophy of mind, although other issues are addressed,\nsuch as the [hard problem of\nconsciousness](/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness \"Hard problem of\nconsciousness\"), and the nature of particular mental states.[2][3][4] Aspects\nof the mind that are studied include [mental events](/wiki/Mental_event\n\"Mental event\"), [mental functions](/wiki/Mental_function \"Mental function\"),\n[mental properties](/wiki/Mental_property \"Mental property\"),\n[consciousness](/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\"), the ontology of the\nmind, the nature of thought, and the relationship of the mind to the body.\n\n[Dualism](/wiki/Dualism_\\(philosophy_of_mind\\) \"Dualism \\(philosophy of\nmind\\)\") and [monism](/wiki/Monism \"Monism\") are the two central [schools of\nthought](/wiki/Schools_of_thought \"Schools of thought\") on the mind–body\nproblem, although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other\ncategory neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the\n[Sankhya](/wiki/Sankhya \"Sankhya\") and [Yoga](/wiki/Yoga \"Yoga\") schools of\n[Hindu](/wiki/Hinduism \"Hinduism\") philosophy,[5] and [Plato](/wiki/Plato\n\"Plato\"),[6] but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to [René\nDescartes](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes \"René Descartes\") in the 17th century.[7]\nSubstance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently\nexisting [substance](/wiki/Substance_\\(philosophy\\) \"Substance\n\\(philosophy\\)\"), whereas [property dualists](/wiki/Property_dualism \"Property\ndualism\") maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that\n[emerge](/wiki/Emergentism \"Emergentism\") from and cannot be reduced to the\nbrain, but that it is not a distinct substance.[8]\n\nMonism is the position that mind and body are not\n[ontologically](/wiki/Ontology \"Ontology\") distinct entities (independent\nsubstances). This view was first advocated in [Western\nphilosophy](/wiki/Western_philosophy \"Western philosophy\") by\n[Parmenides](/wiki/Parmenides \"Parmenides\") in the 5th century BC and was\nlater espoused by the 17th century [rationalist](/wiki/Rationalism\n\"Rationalism\") [Baruch Spinoza](/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza \"Baruch Spinoza\").[9]\n[Physicalists](/wiki/Physicalism \"Physicalism\") argue that only entities\npostulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually\nbe explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to\nevolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing\nmental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms\nof property dualism),[10][11][12][13][14][15] and the ontological status of\nsuch mental properties remains unclear.[14][16][17]\n[Idealists](/wiki/Idealism_\\(philosophy\\) \"Idealism \\(philosophy\\)\") maintain\nthat the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental\nitself, or an illusion created by the mind. [Neutral\nmonists](/wiki/Neutral_monism \"Neutral monism\") such as [Ernst\nMach](/wiki/Ernst_Mach \"Ernst Mach\") and [William James](/wiki/William_James\n\"William James\") argue that events in the world can be thought of as either\nmental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships\ninto which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as\n[Spinoza](/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza \"Baruch Spinoza\") adhere to the position that\nthere is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are\nproperties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and\n21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions\ninclude [behaviorism](/wiki/Behaviorism \"Behaviorism\"), the [type identity\ntheory](/wiki/Type_physicalism \"Type physicalism\"), [anomalous\nmonism](/wiki/Anomalous_monism \"Anomalous monism\") and\n[functionalism](/wiki/Functionalism_\\(philosophy_of_mind\\) \"Functionalism\n\\(philosophy of mind\\)\").[18]\n\nMost modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or non-reductive\nphysicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not\nsomething separate from the body.[18] These approaches have been particularly\ninfluential in the sciences, especially in the fields of\n[sociobiology](/wiki/Sociobiology \"Sociobiology\"), [computer\nscience](/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\"), [evolutionary\npsychology](/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology \"Evolutionary psychology\") and the\nvarious [neurosciences](/wiki/Neuroscience \"Neuroscience\").[19][20][21][22]\nReductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will\neventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and\nstates.[23][24][25] Non-reductive physicalists argue that although the mind is\nnot a separate substance, mental properties [supervene](/wiki/Supervenience\n\"Supervenience\") on physical properties, or that the predicates and vocabulary\nused in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be\nreduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical\nscience.[26][27] Continued [neuroscientific](/wiki/Neuroscientific\n\"Neuroscientific\") progress has helped to clarify some of these issues;\nhowever, they are far from being resolved. Modern philosophers of mind\ncontinue to ask how the subjective qualities and the\n[intentionality](/wiki/Intentionality \"Intentionality\") of mental states and\nproperties can be explained in naturalistic terms.[28][29]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Mind–body problem\n  * 2 Dualist solutions to the mind–body problem\n    * 2.1 Arguments for dualism\n    * 2.2 Interactionist dualism\n    * 2.3 Other forms of dualism\n      * 2.3.1 Psychophysical parallelism\n      * 2.3.2 Occasionalism\n      * 2.3.3 Property dualism\n      * 2.3.4 Dual aspect theory\n      * 2.3.5 Experiential dualism\n      * 2.3.6 Hylomorphism\n  * 3 Monist solutions to the mind–body problem\n    * 3.1 Physicalistic monisms\n      * 3.1.1 Behaviorism\n      * 3.1.2 Identity theory\n      * 3.1.3 Functionalism\n      * 3.1.4 Non-reductive physicalism\n      * 3.1.5 Weak emergentism\n      * 3.1.6 Eliminative materialism\n    * 3.2 Non-physicalist monisms\n      * 3.2.1 Idealism\n      * 3.2.2 Neutral monism\n  * 4 Mysterianism\n  * 5 Linguistic criticism of the mind–body problem\n  * 6 Externalism and internalism\n  * 7 Naturalism and its problems\n    * 7.1 Qualia\n    * 7.2 Intentionality\n  * 8 Philosophy of perception\n  * 9 Philosophy of mind and science\n    * 9.1 Neurobiology\n    * 9.2 Computer science\n    * 9.3 Psychology\n    * 9.4 Cognitive science\n  * 10 Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition\n  * 11 Mind in Eastern philosophy\n    * 11.1 Mind in Hindu philosophy\n      * 11.1.1 Dualism\n      * 11.1.2 Vedanta monistic idealism\n      * 11.1.3 Materialism\n    * 11.2 Buddhist philosophy of mind\n      * 11.2.1 Abhidharma theories of mind\n      * 11.2.2 Indian Mahayana\n      * 11.2.3 Tibetan Buddhism\n      * 11.2.4 Zen Buddhism\n  * 12 Topics related to philosophy of mind\n    * 12.1 Free will\n    * 12.2 Self\n  * 13 See also\n  * 14 References\n  * 15 Further reading\n  * 16 External links\n\n## Mind–body\nproblem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Mind–body problem\")]\n\nMain article: [Mind–body problem](/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem \"Mind–body\nproblem\")\n\nThe mind–body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists\nbetween [minds](/wiki/Mind \"Mind\"), or [mental\nprocesses](/wiki/Mental_processes \"Mental processes\"), and bodily states or\nprocesses.[2] The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to\ndetermine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even\nif—minds are affected by and can affect the body.\n\nOur perceptual experiences depend on [stimuli](/wiki/Stimulation\n\"Stimulation\") that arrive at our various [sensory\norgans](/wiki/Sensory_system \"Sensory system\") from the external world, and\nthese stimuli cause changes in our mental states, ultimately causing us to\nfeel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a\nslice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her\nbody in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she\nwants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences\nto arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical\nproperties.[18]\n\nA related problem is how someone's [propositional\nattitudes](/wiki/Propositional_attitude \"Propositional attitude\") (e.g.\nbeliefs and desires) cause that individual's [neurons](/wiki/Neuron \"Neuron\")\nto fire and muscles to contract. These comprise some of the puzzles that have\nconfronted [epistemologists](/wiki/Epistemology \"Epistemology\") and\nphilosophers of mind from at least the time of [René\nDescartes](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes \"René Descartes\").[7]\n\n## Dualist solutions to the mind–body\nproblem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Dualist solutions to the mind–body problem\")]\n\n[Dualism](/wiki/Dualism_\\(philosophy_of_mind\\) \"Dualism \\(philosophy of\nmind\\)\") is a set of views about the relationship between [mind](/wiki/Mind\n\"Mind\") and [matter](/wiki/Matter \"Matter\") (or [body](/wiki/Human_body \"Human\nbody\")). It begins with the claim that mental [phenomena](/wiki/Phenomenon\n\"Phenomenon\") are, in some respects, non-[physical](/wiki/Nature \"Nature\").[8]\nOne of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in\nthe eastern [Sankhya](/wiki/Sankhya \"Sankhya\") and [Yoga](/wiki/Yoga \"Yoga\")\nschools of [Hindu philosophy](/wiki/Hindu_philosophy \"Hindu philosophy\") (c.\n650 BCE), which divided the world into [purusha](/wiki/Purusha \"Purusha\")\n(mind/spirit) and [prakriti](/wiki/Prakriti \"Prakriti\") (material\nsubstance).[5] Specifically, the [Yoga Sutra](/wiki/Yoga_Sutra \"Yoga Sutra\")\nof [Patanjali](/wiki/Patanjali \"Patanjali\") presents an analytical approach to\nthe nature of the mind.\n\nIn [Western Philosophy](/wiki/Western_Philosophy \"Western Philosophy\"), the\nearliest discussions of dualist ideas are in the writings of\n[Plato](/wiki/Plato \"Plato\") who maintained that humans' \"intelligence\" (a\nfaculty of the mind or soul) could not be identified with, or explained in\nterms of, their physical body.[6][30] However, the best-known version of\ndualism is due to [René Descartes](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes \"René Descartes\")\n(1641), and holds that the mind is a non-extended, non-physical substance, a\n\"[res cogitans](/wiki/Mental_substance \"Mental substance\")\".[7] Descartes was\nthe first to clearly identify the mind with\n[consciousness](/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\") and [self-\nawareness](/wiki/Self-awareness \"Self-awareness\"), and to distinguish this\nfrom the brain, which was the seat of intelligence. He was therefore the first\nto formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it still exists\ntoday.[7]\n\n### Arguments for\ndualism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Arguments for dualism\")]\n\nThe most frequently used argument in favor of dualism appeals to the common-\nsense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter.\nIf asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by\nidentifying it with their [self](/wiki/Self_\\(psychology\\) \"Self\n\\(psychology\\)\"), their personality, their [soul](/wiki/Soul \"Soul\"), or some\nother such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is\nthe brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that there is just one\n[ontological](/wiki/Ontology \"Ontology\") entity at play to be too mechanistic,\nor simply unintelligible.[8] Many modern philosophers of mind think that these\nintuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along\nwith [empirical evidence](/wiki/Empirical_evidence \"Empirical evidence\") from\nthe sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any\nreal basis to them.[8]\n\nAnother important argument in favor of dualism is that the mental and the\nphysical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable,\nproperties.[31] Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical\nevents do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger\nfeels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a\nperson. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the\nuptake of [glutamate](/wiki/Glutamate \"Glutamate\") in the dorsolateral portion\nof the [hippocampus](/wiki/Hippocampus \"Hippocampus\") feels like.\n\nPhilosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events\n\"[qualia](/wiki/Qualia \"Qualia\")\" or \"raw feels\".[31] There is something that\nit is like to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are\nqualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to\nreduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating\nthat we could conceivably know all the objective information about something,\nsuch as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the\ncolor red, but still not know something fundamental about the situation – what\nit is like to see the color red.[32]\n\nIf consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the\nbrain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning\nconsciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects\nphysical reality. One possible explanation is that of a miracle, proposed by\n[Arnold Geulincx](/wiki/Arnold_Geulincx \"Arnold Geulincx\") and [Nicolas\nMalebranche](/wiki/Nicolas_Malebranche \"Nicolas Malebranche\"), where all\nmind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.\n\nAnother possible argument that has been proposed by [C. S.\nLewis](/wiki/C._S._Lewis \"C. S. Lewis\")[33] is the [Argument from\nReason](/wiki/Argument_from_Reason \"Argument from Reason\"): if, as monism\nimplies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then we have\nno reason for assuming that they are also the [consequent](/wiki/Consequent\n\"Consequent\") of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by\nreasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there\nwould be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it,\nexcept by a fluke.\n\nThe [zombie argument](/wiki/P-zombie \"P-zombie\") is based on a [thought\nexperiment](/wiki/Thought_experiment \"Thought experiment\") proposed by Todd\nMoody, and developed by [David Chalmers](/wiki/David_Chalmers \"David\nChalmers\") in his book _[The Conscious Mind](/wiki/The_Conscious_Mind \"The\nConscious Mind\")_. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and\ntherefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states\nbeing associated with this body. Chalmers' argument is that it seems possible\nthat such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only\nthe things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of\nit. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to\nconsciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by\ndefinition described scientifically via [physics](/wiki/Physics \"Physics\"),\nthe move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one.[34]\nOthers such as Dennett have [argued](/wiki/Philosophical_zombie#Criticism\n\"Philosophical zombie\") that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an\nincoherent,[35] or unlikely,[36] concept. It has been argued under physicalism\nthat one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie,\nor that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own\nconviction about being (or not being) a zombie is a product of the physical\nworld and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been\nexpressed by Dennett who argues that \"Zombies think they are conscious, think\nthey have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to\nthis lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever\ndiscover!\"[35] See also the [problem of other\nminds](/wiki/Problem_of_other_minds \"Problem of other minds\").\n\n### Interactionist\ndualism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Interactionist dualism\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Frans_Hals_-\n_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg/220px-Frans_Hals_-\n_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg)](/wiki/File:Frans_Hals_-\n_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPortrait of [René Descartes](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes \"René Descartes\") by\n[Frans Hals](/wiki/Frans_Hals \"Frans Hals\") (1648)\n\nInteractionist dualism, or simply interactionism, is the particular form of\ndualism first espoused by Descartes in the _Meditations_.[7] In the 20th\ncentury, its major defenders have been [Karl Popper](/wiki/Karl_Popper \"Karl\nPopper\") and [John Carew Eccles](/wiki/John_Carew_Eccles \"John Carew\nEccles\").[37] It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires,\ncausally interact with physical states.[8]\n\nDescartes' famous argument for this position can be summarized as follows:\nSeth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no\nspatial extension (i.e., it cannot be measured in terms of length, weight,\nheight, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as\nsomething that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able\nto think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have\nradically different properties.[7]\n\nAt the same time, however, it is clear that Seth's mental states (desires,\nbeliefs, etc.) have [causal](/wiki/Causality \"Causality\") effects on his body\nand vice versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain\n(mental event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a\nsense of fear and protectiveness in the caregiver (mental event), and so on.\n\nDescartes' argument crucially depends on the premise that what Seth believes\nto be \"clear and distinct\" ideas in his mind are [necessarily\ntrue](/wiki/Logical_truth \"Logical truth\"). Many contemporary philosophers\ndoubt this.[38][39][40] For example, [Joseph Agassi](/wiki/Joseph_Agassi\n\"Joseph Agassi\") suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the\nearly 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own\nideas. [Freud](/wiki/Sigmund_Freud \"Sigmund Freud\") claimed that a\npsychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious\nmotivations better than the person himself does. [Duhem](/wiki/Pierre_Duhem\n\"Pierre Duhem\") has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's\nmethods of discovery better than that person herself does, while\n[Malinowski](/wiki/Bronis%C5%82aw_Malinowski \"Bronisław Malinowski\") has shown\nthat an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the\nperson whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern\npsychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there\nprovide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can\ndescribe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.[41][42]\n\n### Other forms of\ndualism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Other forms of dualism\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/DualismCausationViews3.svg/400px-\nDualismCausationViews3.svg.png)](/wiki/File:DualismCausationViews3.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:DualismCausationViews3.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFour varieties of dualism. The arrows indicate the direction of the causal\ninteractions. Occasionalism is not shown.\n\n#### Psychophysical\nparallelism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Psychophysical parallelism\")]\n\n[Psychophysical parallelism](/wiki/Psychophysical_parallelism \"Psychophysical\nparallelism\"), or simply **parallelism** , is the view that mind and body,\nwhile having distinct ontological statuses, do not causally influence one\nanother. Instead, they run along parallel paths (mind events causally interact\nwith mind events and brain events causally interact with brain events) and\nonly seem to influence each other.[43] This view was most prominently defended\nby [Gottfried Leibniz](/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz \"Gottfried Leibniz\"). Although\nLeibniz was an ontological monist who believed that only one type of\nsubstance, the [monad](/wiki/Monad_\\(Greek_philosophy\\) \"Monad \\(Greek\nphilosophy\\)\"), exists in the universe, and that everything is reducible to\nit, he nonetheless maintained that there was an important distinction between\n\"the mental\" and \"the physical\" in terms of causation. He held that God had\narranged things in advance so that minds and bodies would be in harmony with\neach other. This is known as the doctrine of [pre-established\nharmony](/wiki/Pre-established_harmony \"Pre-established harmony\").[44]\n\n####\nOccasionalism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Occasionalism\")]\n\n[Occasionalism](/wiki/Occasionalism \"Occasionalism\") is the view espoused by\n[Nicholas Malebranche](/wiki/Nicholas_Malebranche \"Nicholas Malebranche\") that\nasserts that all supposedly causal relations between physical events, or\nbetween physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body\nand mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are\nrelated to their effects by an act of God's intervention on each specific\noccasion.[45]\n\n#### Property\ndualism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Property dualism\")]\n\n[Property dualism](/wiki/Property_dualism \"Property dualism\") is the view that\nthe world is constituted of just one kind of\n[substance](/wiki/Substance_theory \"Substance theory\") – the physical kind –\nand there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [physical\nproperties](/wiki/Physical_properties \"Physical properties\") and [mental\nproperties](/wiki/Mental_properties \"Mental properties\"). In other words, it\nis the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and\nemotions) inhere in some physical bodies (at least, brains). How mental and\nphysical properties relate causally depends on the variety of property dualism\nin question, and is not always a clear issue. Sub-varieties of property\ndualism include:\n\n  1. [Strong emergentism](/wiki/Strong_emergentism \"Strong emergentism\") asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e. in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws. Hence, it is a form of [emergent materialism](/wiki/Emergent_materialism \"Emergent materialism\").[8] These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to, or explained in terms of, the physical substrate from which they emerge. They are dependent on the physical properties from which they emerge, but opinions vary as to the coherence of [top–down causation](/w/index.php?title=Top%E2%80%93down_causation&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Top–down causation \\(page does not exist\\)\"), i.e. the causal effectiveness of such properties. A form of property dualism has been espoused by [David Chalmers](/wiki/David_Chalmers \"David Chalmers\") and the concept has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years,[46] but was already suggested in the 19th century by [William James](/wiki/William_James \"William James\").\n  2. [Epiphenomenalism](/wiki/Epiphenomenalism \"Epiphenomenalism\") is a doctrine first formulated by [Thomas Henry Huxley](/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley \"Thomas Henry Huxley\").[47] It consists of the view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world.[43] This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by [Frank Jackson](/wiki/Frank_Cameron_Jackson \"Frank Cameron Jackson\").[48]\n  3. [Non-reductive Physicalism](/wiki/Property_dualism#Non-reductive_Physicalism \"Property dualism\") is the view that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia in the case of non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.\n  4. [Panpsychism](/wiki/Panpsychism \"Panpsychism\") is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of [complex](/wiki/Complexity \"Complexity\") structure in a compound object. So long as the _reduction_ of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.\n\n#### Dual aspect\ntheory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Dual aspect theory\")]\n\n[Dual aspect theory](/wiki/Dual_aspect_theory \"Dual aspect theory\") or dual-\naspect monism is the view that the [mental](/wiki/Mind \"Mind\") and the\n[physical](/wiki/Nature \"Nature\") are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the\nsame substance. (Thus it is a mixed position, which is monistic in some\nrespects). In modern philosophical writings, the theory's relationship to\n[neutral monism](/wiki/Neutral_monism \"Neutral monism\") has become somewhat\nill-defined, but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism\nallows the context of a given group of neutral elements and the relationships\ninto which they enter to determine whether the group can be thought of as\nmental, physical, both, or neither, dual-aspect theory suggests that the\nmental and the physical are manifestations (or aspects) of some underlying\nsubstance, entity or process that is itself neither mental nor physical as\nnormally understood. Various formulations of dual-aspect monism also require\nthe mental and the physical to be complementary, mutually irreducible and\nperhaps inseparable (though distinct).[49][50][51]\n\n#### Experiential\ndualism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Experiential dualism\")]\n\nThis is a philosophy of mind that regards the degrees of freedom between\nmental and physical well-being as not necessarily synonymous thus implying an\nexperiential dualism between body and mind. An example of these disparate\ndegrees of freedom is given by [Allan Wallace](/wiki/B._Alan_Wallace \"B. Alan\nWallace\") who notes that it is \"experientially apparent that one may be\nphysically uncomfortable—for instance, while engaging in a strenuous physical\nworkout—while mentally cheerful; conversely, one may be mentally distraught\nwhile experiencing physical comfort\".[52] Experiential dualism notes that our\nsubjective experience of merely seeing something in the physical world seems\nqualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from\nlosing a loved one. This philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism\nwhich is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to\naffect one another. Mental states can cause changes in physical states and\nvice versa.\n\nHowever, unlike cartesian dualism or some other systems, experiential dualism\ndoes not posit two fundamental substances in reality: mind and matter. Rather,\nexperiential dualism is to be understood as a conceptual framework that gives\ncredence to the qualitative difference between the experience of mental and\nphysical states. Experiential dualism is accepted as the conceptual framework\nof [Madhyamaka Buddhism](/wiki/Madhyamaka \"Madhyamaka\").\n\nMadhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding fault with the monist view of\nphysicalist philosophies of mind as well in that these generally posit matter\nand energy as the fundamental substance of reality. Nonetheless, this does not\nimply that the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as\nerror any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.\n\n> In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up\n> the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the\n> substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely,\n> physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism\n> propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real\n> world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental\n> phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of\n> themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and\n> reality.[52]\n\nIndeed physicalism, or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance\nof reality, is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.\n\n> In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical\n> events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do\n> exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have\n> mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical\n> attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For\n> example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another\n> person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more\n> appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from\n> one's childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any\n> sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, for\n> the simple reason that they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely\n> characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the\n> physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.[52]\n\n####\nHylomorphism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Hylomorphism\")]\n\nMain article: [Hylomorphism](/wiki/Hylomorphism \"Hylomorphism\")\n\nHylomorphism is a theory that originates with [Aristotelian\nphilosophy](/wiki/Aristotle \"Aristotle\"), which conceives [being](/wiki/Ousia\n\"Ousia\") as a compound of [matter](/wiki/Matter \"Matter\") and\n[form](/wiki/Substantial_form \"Substantial form\"). \"Hylomorphism\" is a 19th-\ncentury term formed from the Greek words ὕλη _hyle_ , \"wood, matter\", and\nμορφή, _morphē_ , \"form\".\n\n## Monist solutions to the mind–body\nproblem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Monist solutions to the mind–body problem\")]\n\nIn contrast to [dualism](/wiki/Dualism \"Dualism\"), [monism](/wiki/Monism\n\"Monism\") does not accept any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally\ndisparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies\nfor over two millennia. In [Indian](/wiki/Indian_philosophy \"Indian\nphilosophy\") and [Chinese philosophy](/wiki/Chinese_philosophy \"Chinese\nphilosophy\"), monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the\nmost common forms of monism in Western philosophy are\n[physicalist](/wiki/Physicalism \"Physicalism\").[18] Physicalistic monism\nasserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that\nterm to be clarified by our best science.[53] However, a variety of\nformulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism,\n[idealism](/wiki/Idealism \"Idealism\"), states that the only existing substance\nis mental. Although pure idealism, such as that of [George\nBerkeley](/wiki/George_Berkeley \"George Berkeley\"), is uncommon in\ncontemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called\n[panpsychism](/wiki/Panpsychism \"Panpsychism\"), according to which mental\nexperience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and\nproperties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as [Alfred North\nWhitehead](/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead \"Alfred North Whitehead\")[54] and\n[David Ray Griffin](/wiki/David_Ray_Griffin \"David Ray Griffin\").[46]\n\n[Phenomenalism](/wiki/Phenomenalism \"Phenomenalism\") is the theory that\nrepresentations (or [sense data](/wiki/Sense_data \"Sense data\")) of external\nobjects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by [Bertrand\nRussell](/wiki/Bertrand_Russell \"Bertrand Russell\") and many of the [logical\npositivists](/wiki/Logical_positivists \"Logical positivists\") during the early\n20th century.[55] A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic\nsubstance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would\nthen both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted\nby Baruch Spinoza[9] and was popularized by [Ernst Mach](/wiki/Ernst_Mach\n\"Ernst Mach\")[56] in the 19th century. This [neutral\nmonism](/wiki/Neutral_monism \"Neutral monism\"), as it is called, resembles\nproperty dualism.\n\n### Physicalistic\nmonisms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Physicalistic monisms\")]\n\n####\nBehaviorism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Behaviorism\")]\n\nMain article: [Behaviorism](/wiki/Behaviorism \"Behaviorism\")\n\nBehaviorism dominated philosophy of mind for much of the 20th century,\nespecially the first half.[18] In psychology, behaviorism developed as a\nreaction to the inadequacies of [introspectionism](/wiki/Introspection\n\"Introspection\").[53] Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life\nare not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form\npredictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of\nthird-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be\nscientific.[53] The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an\ninterior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether\nand focus instead on the description of observable behavior.[57]\n\nParallel to these developments in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism\n(sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed.[53] This is\ncharacterized by a strong [verificationism](/wiki/Verificationism\n\"Verificationism\"), which generally considers unverifiable statements about\ninterior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not\ninterior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just\ndescriptions of behavior or [dispositions](/wiki/Disposition \"Disposition\") to\nbehave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's\nbehavior.[58]\n\nPhilosophical behaviorism has fallen out of favor since the latter half of the\n20th century, coinciding with the rise of\n[cognitivism](/wiki/Cognitivism_\\(psychology\\) \"Cognitivism\n\\(psychology\\)\").[2] Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several perceived\nproblems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be\n[counterintuitive](/wiki/Counterintuitive \"Counterintuitive\") when it\nmaintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is\nexperiencing a painful headache.\n\n#### Identity\ntheory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Identity theory\")]\n\nMain article: [Type physicalism](/wiki/Type_physicalism \"Type physicalism\")\n\nType physicalism (or type-identity theory) was developed by [John\nSmart](/wiki/J._J._C._Smart \"J. J. C. Smart\")[25] and [Ullin\nPlace](/wiki/Ullin_Place \"Ullin Place\")[59] as a direct reaction to the\nfailure of behaviorism. These philosophers reasoned that, if mental states are\nsomething material, but not behavioral, then mental states are probably\nidentical to internal states of the brain. In very simplified terms: a mental\nstate _M_ is nothing other than brain state _B_. The mental state \"desire for\na cup of coffee\" would thus be nothing more than the \"firing of certain\nneurons in certain brain regions\".[25]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Anomalous_Monism.png/250px-\nAnomalous_Monism.png)](/wiki/File:Anomalous_Monism.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Anomalous_Monism.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe classic Identity theory and Anomalous Monism in contrast. For the Identity\ntheory, every token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds (as\nindicated by the arrows) to a physical token of a single physical type. For\nanomalous monism, the token–token correspondences can fall outside of the\ntype–type correspondences. The result is token identity.\n\nDespite its initial plausibility, the identity theory faces a strong challenge\nin the form of the thesis of [multiple\nrealizability](/wiki/Multiple_realizability \"Multiple realizability\"), first\nformulated by [Hilary Putnam](/wiki/Hilary_Putnam \"Hilary Putnam\").[27] It is\nobvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for\nexample, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these\ndiverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain\nstate. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific\nbrain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.[27]\n\nOn the other hand, even granted the above, it does not follow that identity\ntheories of all types must be abandoned. According to token identity theories,\nthe fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of\na person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between\ntypes of mental state and types of brain state. The type–token distinction can\nbe illustrated by a simple example: the word \"green\" contains four types of\nletters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter _e_ along\nwith one each of the others. The idea of token identity is that only\nparticular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular\noccurrences or tokenings of physical events.[60] Anomalous monism (see below)\nand most other non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories.[61]\nDespite these problems, there is a renewed interest in the type identity\ntheory today, primarily due to the influence of [Jaegwon\nKim](/wiki/Jaegwon_Kim \"Jaegwon Kim\").[25]\n\n####\nFunctionalism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Functionalism\")]\n\nMain article: [Functionalism (philosophy of\nmind)](/wiki/Functionalism_\\(philosophy_of_mind\\) \"Functionalism \\(philosophy\nof mind\\)\")\n\nFunctionalism was formulated by [Hilary Putnam](/wiki/Hilary_Putnam \"Hilary\nPutnam\") and [Jerry Fodor](/wiki/Jerry_Fodor \"Jerry Fodor\") as a reaction to\nthe inadequacies of the identity theory.[27] Putnam and Fodor saw mental\nstates in terms of an empirical [computational theory of the\nmind](/wiki/Computational_theory_of_mind \"Computational theory of mind\").[62]\nAt about the same time or slightly after, [D.M.\nArmstrong](/wiki/D.M._Armstrong \"D.M. Armstrong\") and [David Kellogg\nLewis](/wiki/David_Kellogg_Lewis \"David Kellogg Lewis\") formulated a version\nof functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms\nof functional roles.[63] Finally, [Wittgenstein](/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein\n\"Ludwig Wittgenstein\")'s idea of meaning as use led to a version of\nfunctionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by [Wilfrid\nSellars](/wiki/Wilfrid_Sellars \"Wilfrid Sellars\") and [Gilbert\nHarman](/wiki/Gilbert_Harman \"Gilbert Harman\"). Another one,\n[psychofunctionalism](/wiki/Functionalism_\\(philosophy_of_mind\\)#Psychofunctionalism\n\"Functionalism \\(philosophy of mind\\)\"), is an approach adopted by the\n[naturalistic philosophy of\nmind](/wiki/Naturalism_\\(philosophy\\)#Metaphysical_naturalism \"Naturalism\n\\(philosophy\\)\") associated with Jerry Fodor and [Zenon\nPylyshyn](/wiki/Zenon_Pylyshyn \"Zenon Pylyshyn\").\n\nWhat all these different varieties of functionalism share in common is the\nthesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with\nother mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is,\nfunctionalism abstracts away from the details of the physical implementation\nof a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional\nproperties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its\nfunctional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances.\nFrom this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made\nup of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that\nit plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.[62]\n\n#### Non-reductive\nphysicalism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Non-reductive physicalism\")]\n\nMain article: [Physicalism](/wiki/Physicalism \"Physicalism\")\n\nNon-reductionist philosophers hold firmly to two essential convictions with\nregard to mind–body relations: 1) Physicalism is true and mental states must\nbe physical states, but 2) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory:\nmental states cannot be reduced to behavior, brain states or functional\nstates.[53] Hence, the question arises whether there can still be a non-\nreductive physicalism. [Donald Davidson](/wiki/Donald_Davidson_\\(philosopher\\)\n\"Donald Davidson \\(philosopher\\)\")'s [anomalous monism](/wiki/Anomalous_monism\n\"Anomalous monism\")[26] is an attempt to formulate such a physicalism. He\n\"thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities\nof Reason, such as akrasia or self-deception, the personal psychology\nframework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one, but rather\nmust be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle\nof charity can be found elsewhere.\"[64]\n\nDavidson uses the thesis of [supervenience](/wiki/Supervenience\n\"Supervenience\"): mental states supervene on physical states, but are not\nreducible to them. \"Supervenience\" therefore describes a functional\ndependence: there can be no change in the mental without some change in the\nphysical–causal reducibility between the mental and physical without\nontological reducibility.[65]\n\nBecause non-reductive physicalist theories attempt to both retain the\nontological distinction between mind and body and to try to solve the \"surfeit\nof explanations puzzle\" in some way; critics often see this as a paradox and\npoint out the similarities to [epiphenomenalism](/wiki/Epiphenomenalism\n\"Epiphenomenalism\"), in that it is the brain that is seen as the root \"cause\"\nnot the mind, and the mind seems to be rendered inert.\n\nEpiphenomenalism regards one or more mental states as the byproduct of\nphysical brain states, having no influence on physical states. The interaction\nis one-way (solving the \"surfeit of explanations puzzle\") but leaving us with\nnon-reducible mental states (as a byproduct of brain states) – causally\nreducible, but ontologically irreducible to physical states. Pain would be\nseen by epiphenomenaliasts as being caused by the brain state but as not\nhaving effects on other brain states, though it might have effects on other\nmental states (i.e. cause distress).\n\n#### Weak\nemergentism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Weak emergentism\")]\n\nMain article: [Emergentism](/wiki/Emergentism \"Emergentism\")\n\nWeak emergentism is a form of \"non-reductive physicalism\" that involves a\nlayered view of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing\ncomplexity and each corresponding to its own special science. Some\nphilosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more\nfundamental levels, while others maintain that higher-order properties simply\nsupervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction. The latter\ngroup therefore holds a less strict, or \"weaker\", definition of emergentism,\nwhich can be rigorously stated as follows: a property P of composite object O\nis emergent if it is metaphysically impossible for another object to lack\nproperty P if that object is composed of parts with intrinsic properties\nidentical to those in O and has those parts in an identical configuration.\n\nSometimes emergentists use the example of water having a new property when\nHydrogen H and Oxygen O combine to form H2O (water). In this example there\n\"emerges\" a new property of a transparent liquid that would not have been\npredicted by understanding hydrogen and oxygen as gases. This is analogous to\nphysical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state. Emergentists\ntry to solve the notorious mind–body gap this way. One problem for emergentism\nis the idea of \"causal closure\" in the world that does not allow for a mind-\nto-body causation.[66]\n\n#### Eliminative\nmaterialism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Eliminative materialism\")]\n\nMain article: [Eliminative materialism](/wiki/Eliminative_materialism\n\"Eliminative materialism\")\n\nIf one is a materialist and believes that all aspects of our common-sense\npsychology will find reduction to a mature [cognitive\nneuroscience](/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience \"Cognitive neuroscience\"), and that\nnon-reductive materialism is mistaken, then one can adopt a final, more\nradical position: eliminative materialism.\n\nThere are several varieties of eliminative materialism, but all maintain that\nour common-sense \"[folk psychology](/wiki/Folk_psychology \"Folk psychology\")\"\nbadly misrepresents the nature of some aspect of cognition. Eliminativists\nsuch as [Patricia](/wiki/Patricia_Churchland \"Patricia Churchland\") and [Paul\nChurchland](/wiki/Paul_Churchland \"Paul Churchland\") argue that while folk\npsychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentence-like, the non-linguistic\nvector/matrix model of neural network theory or\n[connectionism](/wiki/Connectionism \"Connectionism\") will prove to be a much\nmore accurate account of how the brain works.[23]\n\nThe Churchlands often invoke the fate of other, erroneous popular theories and\n[ontologies](/wiki/Ontology \"Ontology\") that have arisen in the course of\nhistory.[23][24] For example, Ptolemaic astronomy served to explain and\nroughly predict the motions of the planets for centuries, but eventually this\nmodel of the solar system was eliminated in favor of the Copernican model. The\nChurchlands believe the same eliminative fate awaits the \"sentence-cruncher\"\nmodel of the mind in which thought and behavior are the result of manipulating\nsentence-like states called \"[propositional\nattitudes](/wiki/Propositional_attitude \"Propositional attitude\")\".\n\n### Non-physicalist\nmonisms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Non-physicalist monisms\")]\n\n####\nIdealism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Idealism\")]\n\n[Idealism](/wiki/Idealism \"Idealism\") is the form of monism that sees the\nworld as consisting of minds, mental contents and or consciousness. Idealists\nare not faced with explaining how minds arise from bodies: rather, the world,\nbodies and objects are regarded as mere appearances held by minds. However,\naccounting for the mind–body problem is not usually the main motivation for\nidealism; rather, idealists tend to be motivated by\n[skepticism](/wiki/Skepticism \"Skepticism\"), intentionality, and the unique\nnature of ideas. Idealism is prominent in Eastern religious and philosophical\nthought. It has gone through several cycles of popularity and neglect in the\nhistory of Western philosophy.\n\nDifferent varieties of idealism may hold that there are\n\n  * multiple minds ([pluralistic idealism](/wiki/Pluralistic_idealism \"Pluralistic idealism\"))\n  * only one human mind ([solipsism](/wiki/Solipsism \"Solipsism\"))\n  * or a single [Absolute](/wiki/Absolute_\\(philosophy\\) \"Absolute \\(philosophy\\)\"), [Anima Mundi](/wiki/Anima_Mundi \"Anima Mundi\"), [One](/wiki/Plotinus#One \"Plotinus\") or [Over-soul](/wiki/Over-soul \"Over-soul\").\n\n#### Neutral\nmonism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Neutral monism\")]\n\n[Neutral monism](/wiki/Neutral_monism \"Neutral monism\"), in\n[philosophy](/wiki/Philosophy \"Philosophy\"), is the\n[metaphysical](/wiki/Metaphysics \"Metaphysics\") view that the mental and the\nphysical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are\nthemselves \"neutral\", that is, neither physical nor mental. This view denies\nthat the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things.\nRather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff,\nin the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor\nphysical. These neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape,\njust as we experience those properties. But these shaped and colored elements\ndo not exist in a mind (considered as a substantial entity, whether\ndualistically or physicalistically); they exist on their own.\n\n##\nMysterianism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Mysterianism\")]\n\nMain article: [New mysterianism](/wiki/New_mysterianism \"New mysterianism\")\n\nSome philosophers take an epistemic approach and argue that the mind–body\nproblem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to\nhuman beings. This is usually termed [New mysterianism](/wiki/New_mysterianism\n\"New mysterianism\"). [Colin McGinn](/wiki/Colin_McGinn \"Colin McGinn\") holds\nthat human beings are [cognitively\nclosed](/wiki/Cognitive_closure_\\(philosophy\\) \"Cognitive closure\n\\(philosophy\\)\") in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human\nminds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties\nsuch as [consciousness](/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\") arise from their\ncausal basis.[67] An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in\nregards to particle physics.\n\nA more moderate conception has been expounded by [Thomas\nNagel](/wiki/Thomas_Nagel \"Thomas Nagel\"), which holds that the mind–body\nproblem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development\nand that it might take a future scientific [paradigm\nshift](/wiki/Paradigm_shift \"Paradigm shift\") or revolution to bridge the\n[explanatory gap](/wiki/Explanatory_gap \"Explanatory gap\"). Nagel posits that\nin the future a sort of \"objective\n[phenomenology](/wiki/Phenomenology_\\(philosophy\\) \"Phenomenology\n\\(philosophy\\)\")\" might be able to bridge the gap between subjective conscious\nexperience and its physical basis.[68]\n\n## Linguistic criticism of the mind–body\nproblem[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Linguistic criticism of the mind–body problem\")]\n\nEach attempt to answer the mind–body problem encounters substantial problems.\nSome philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual\nconfusion.[69] These philosophers, such as [Ludwig\nWittgenstein](/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein \"Ludwig Wittgenstein\") and his\nfollowers in the tradition of linguistic criticism, therefore reject the\nproblem as illusory.[70] They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and\nbiological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human\nexperience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in\na biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the\none in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in\nthe wrong contexts.[70] This is the case, for instance, if one searches for\nmental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use\nof mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a\n[category error](/wiki/Category_error \"Category error\") or a sort of fallacy\nof reasoning.[70]\n\nToday, such a position is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such\nas [Peter Hacker](/wiki/Peter_Hacker \"Peter Hacker\").[69] However, [Hilary\nPutnam](/wiki/Hilary_Putnam \"Hilary Putnam\"), the originator of functionalism,\nhas also adopted the position that the mind–body problem is an illusory\nproblem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein.[71]\n\n## Externalism and\ninternalism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Externalism and internalism\")]\n\nWhere is the mind located? If the mind is a physical phenomenon of some kind,\nit has to be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible\noptions: either the mind is internal to the body\n([internalism](/wiki/Internalism \"Internalism\")) or the mind is external to it\n([externalism](/wiki/Externalism \"Externalism\")). More generally, either the\nmind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's\nbody or it depends also on factors external to it.\n\nProponents of internalism are committed to the view that neural activity is\nsufficient to produce the mind. Proponents of externalism maintain that the\nsurrounding world is in some sense constitutive of the mind.\n\nExternalism differentiates into several versions. The main ones are [semantic\nexternalism](/wiki/Semantic_externalism \"Semantic externalism\"), [cognitive\nexternalism](/w/index.php?title=Cognitive_externalism&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Cognitive externalism \\(page does not exist\\)\") and [phenomenal\nexternalism](/w/index.php?title=Phenomenal_externalism&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Phenomenal externalism \\(page does not exist\\)\"). Each of these versions of\nexternalism can further be divided into whether they refer only to the content\nor to the vehicles of the mind.\n\nSemantic externalism holds that the semantic content of the mind is totally or\npartially defined by a state of affairs external to the body of the subject.\n[Hilary Putnam](/wiki/Hilary_Putnam \"Hilary Putnam\")'s [Twin Earth thought\nexperiment](/wiki/Twin_Earth_thought_experiment \"Twin Earth thought\nexperiment\") is a good example.\n\nCognitive externalism is a very broad collection of views that suggests the\nrole of the environment, of tools, of development, and of the body in fleshing\nout cognition. [Embodied cognition](/wiki/Embodied_cognition \"Embodied\ncognition\"), the [extended mind](/wiki/Extended_mind \"Extended mind\"), and\n[enactivism](/wiki/Enactivism \"Enactivism\") are good examples.\n\nPhenomenal externalism suggests that the phenomenal aspects of the mind are\nexternal to the body. Authors who addressed this possibility are Ted\nHonderich, Edwin Holt, Francois Tonneau, Kevin O'Regan, Riccardo Manzotti,\nTeed Rockwell and Max Velmans.\n\n## Naturalism and its\nproblems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Naturalism and its problems\")]\n\nThe thesis of physicalism is that the mind is part of the material (or\nphysical) world. Such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain\nproperties that no other material thing seems to possess. Physicalism must\ntherefore explain how it is possible that these properties can nonetheless\nemerge from a material thing. The project of providing such an explanation is\noften referred to as the \"[naturalization](/wiki/Naturalism_\\(philosophy\\)\n\"Naturalism \\(philosophy\\)\") of the mental\".[53] Some of the crucial problems\nthat this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the\nnature of intentionality.[53]\n\n### Qualia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Qualia\")]\n\nMain article: [Qualia](/wiki/Qualia \"Qualia\")\n\nMany mental states seem to be experienced subjectively in different ways by\ndifferent individuals.[32] And it is characteristic of a mental state that it\nhas some experiential _quality_ , e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the\nsensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since no one\nhas a perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly\nhow it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these\nexperiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves,\ncannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative\nexperiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an\naccompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to\nexplain.[31]\n\nYet it also seems to many that science will eventually have to explain such\nexperiences.[53] This [follows from](/wiki/Logical_consequence \"Logical\nconsequence\") an assumption about the possibility of [reductive\nexplanations](/wiki/Reductionism \"Reductionism\"). According to this view, if\nan attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g.,\nwater), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties\n(e.g., fluidity, transparency).[53] In the case of mental states, this means\nthat there needs to be an explanation of why they have the property of being\nexperienced in a certain way.\n\nThe 20th-century German philosopher [Martin Heidegger](/wiki/Martin_Heidegger\n\"Martin Heidegger\") criticized the [ontological](/wiki/Ontology \"Ontology\")\nassumptions underpinning such a reductive model, and claimed that it was\nimpossible to make sense of experience in these terms. This is because,\naccording to Heidegger, the nature of our subjective experience and its\n_qualities_ is impossible to understand in terms of\n[Cartesian](/wiki/Descartes \"Descartes\") \"substances\" that bear \"properties\".\nAnother way to put this is that the very concept of qualitative experience is\nincoherent in terms of—or is semantically\n[incommensurable](/wiki/Commensurability_\\(philosophy_of_science\\)\n\"Commensurability \\(philosophy of science\\)\") with the concept of—substances\nthat bear properties.[72]\n\nThis problem of explaining introspective first-person aspects of mental states\nand consciousness in general in terms of third-person quantitative\nneuroscience is called the [explanatory gap](/wiki/Explanatory_gap\n\"Explanatory gap\").[73] There are several different views of the nature of\nthis gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. [David\nChalmers](/wiki/David_Chalmers \"David Chalmers\") and the early [Frank\nJackson](/wiki/Frank_Cameron_Jackson \"Frank Cameron Jackson\") interpret the\ngap as [ontological](/wiki/Ontology \"Ontology\") in nature; that is, they\nmaintain that qualia can never be explained by science because\n[physicalism](/wiki/Physicalism \"Physicalism\") is false. There are two\nseparate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other.[74] An\nalternative view is taken by philosophers such as [Thomas\nNagel](/wiki/Thomas_Nagel \"Thomas Nagel\") and [Colin\nMcGinn](/wiki/Colin_McGinn \"Colin McGinn\"). According to them, the gap is\n[epistemological](/wiki/Epistemology \"Epistemology\") in nature. For Nagel,\nscience is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not\nyet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required. We are not\neven able to formulate the problem coherently.[32] For McGinn, on other hand,\nthe problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are\nnot able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective\nexperiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum\nphysics is cognitively closed to elephants.[75] Other philosophers liquidate\nthe gap as purely a semantic problem. This semantic problem, of course, led to\nthe famous \"_Qualia Question_ \", which is: _Does Red cause Redness_?\n\n###\nIntentionality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Intentionality\")]\n\nMain article: [Intentionality](/wiki/Intentionality \"Intentionality\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/John_Searle_2002.jpg/220px-\nJohn_Searle_2002.jpg)](/wiki/File:John_Searle_2002.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:John_Searle_2002.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[John Searle](/wiki/John_Searle \"John Searle\")—one of the most influential\nphilosophers of mind, proponent of [biological\nnaturalism](/wiki/Biological_naturalism \"Biological naturalism\") (Berkeley\n2002)\n\n[Intentionality](/wiki/Intentionality \"Intentionality\") is the capacity of\nmental states to be directed towards (_about_) or be in relation with\nsomething in the external world.[29] This property of mental states entails\nthat they have [contents](/wiki/Mental_content \"Mental content\") and [semantic\nreferents](/wiki/Semantics \"Semantics\") and can therefore be assigned [truth\nvalues](/wiki/Truth_value \"Truth value\"). When one tries to reduce these\nstates to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not\ntrue or false, they simply happen.[76] It would not make any sense to say that\na natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or\nfalse, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural\nprocesses? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that\nsuch ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that\n[Herodotus](/wiki/Herodotus \"Herodotus\") was a historian refers to Herodotus\nand to the fact that he was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is\ntrue; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the\nbrain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have\nanything to do with Herodotus.[28]\n\n## Philosophy of\nperception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Philosophy of perception\")]\n\nMain article: [Philosophy of perception](/wiki/Philosophy_of_perception\n\"Philosophy of perception\")\n\n[Philosophy of perception](/wiki/Philosophy_of_perception \"Philosophy of\nperception\") is concerned with the nature of [perceptual\nexperience](/wiki/Perception \"Perception\") and the status of perceptual\nobjects, in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and\nbeliefs about the world. The main contemporary views within philosophy of\nperception include naive realism, enactivism and representional\nviews.[3][4][77]\n\n## Philosophy of mind and\nscience[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Philosophy of mind and science\")]\n\nHumans are corporeal beings and, as such, they are subject to examination and\ndescription by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately\nrelated to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences\nfurnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind.[2]\nThere are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the\nmental. The list of such sciences includes: [biology](/wiki/Biology\n\"Biology\"), [computer science](/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\"),\n[cognitive science](/wiki/Cognitive_science \"Cognitive science\"),\n[cybernetics](/wiki/Cybernetics \"Cybernetics\"),\n[linguistics](/wiki/Linguistics \"Linguistics\"), [medicine](/wiki/Medicine\n\"Medicine\"), [pharmacology](/wiki/Pharmacology \"Pharmacology\"), and\n[psychology](/wiki/Psychology \"Psychology\").[78]\n\n###\nNeurobiology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Neurobiology\")]\n\nMain article: [Neuroscience](/wiki/Neuroscience \"Neuroscience\")\n\nThe theoretical background of biology, as is the case with modern [natural\nsciences](/wiki/Natural_science \"Natural science\") in general, is\nfundamentally materialistic. The objects of study are, in the first place,\nphysical processes, which are considered to be the foundations of mental\nactivity and behavior.[79] The increasing success of biology in the\nexplanation of mental phenomena can be seen by the absence of any empirical\nrefutation of its fundamental presupposition: \"there can be no change in the\nmental states of a person without a change in brain states.\"[78]\n\nWithin the field of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are\nconcerned with the relations between mental and physical states and\nprocesses:[79] [Sensory neurophysiology](/wiki/Neurophysiology\n\"Neurophysiology\") investigates the relation between the processes of\n[perception](/wiki/Perception \"Perception\") and\n[stimulation](/wiki/Stimulation \"Stimulation\").[80] [Cognitive\nneuroscience](/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience \"Cognitive neuroscience\") studies\nthe correlations between mental processes and neural processes.[80]\n[Neuropsychology](/wiki/Neuropsychology \"Neuropsychology\") describes the\ndependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the\nbrain.[80] Lastly, [evolutionary biology](/wiki/Evolutionary_biology\n\"Evolutionary biology\") studies the origins and development of the human\nnervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also\ndescribes the [ontogenetic](/wiki/Ontogenesis \"Ontogenesis\") and\n[phylogenetic](/wiki/Phylogenesis \"Phylogenesis\") development of mental\nphenomena beginning from their most primitive stages.[78] Evolutionary biology\nfurthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind,\nas the [gene](/wiki/Gene \"Gene\")-based mechanism of [natural\nselection](/wiki/Natural_selection \"Natural selection\") does not allow any\ngiant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but\nonly incremental steps over long time periods.[81]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging.jpg/220px-\nFunctional_magnetic_resonance_imaging.jpg)](/wiki/File:Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSince the 1980s, sophisticated [neuroimaging](/wiki/Neuroimaging\n\"Neuroimaging\") procedures, such as [fMRI](/wiki/FMRI \"FMRI\") (above), have\nfurnished increasing knowledge about the workings of the human brain, shedding\nlight on ancient philosophical problems.\n\nThe [methodological](/wiki/Methodology \"Methodology\") breakthroughs of the\nneurosciences, in particular the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging\nprocedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly\nambitious research programs: one of the main goals is to describe and\ncomprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see:\n[neural correlate](/wiki/Neural_correlate \"Neural correlate\")).[79] Several\ngroups are inspired by these advances.\n\n### Computer\nscience[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=32\n\"Edit section: Computer science\")]\n\nMain article: [Computer science](/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\")\n\nComputer science concerns itself with the automatic processing of\n[information](/wiki/Information \"Information\") (or at least with physical\nsystems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things\nas [computers](/wiki/Computer \"Computer\").[82] From the beginning, [computer\nprogrammers](/wiki/Computer_programmer \"Computer programmer\") have been able\nto develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic\nbeings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear\nwhether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to\nhave what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront\nof much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of\n[artificial intelligence](/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial\nintelligence\") (AI).\n\nWithin AI, it is common to distinguish between a modest research program and a\nmore ambitious one: this distinction was coined by [John\nSearle](/wiki/John_Searle \"John Searle\") in terms of a [weak AI and strong\nAI](/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence#Strong_AI_vs._weak_AI\n\"Philosophy of artificial intelligence\"). The exclusive objective of \"weak\nAI\", according to Searle, is the successful simulation of mental states, with\nno attempt to make computers become conscious or aware, etc. The objective of\nstrong AI, on the contrary, is a computer with consciousness similar to that\nof human beings.[83] The program of strong AI goes back to one of the pioneers\nof computation [Alan Turing](/wiki/Alan_Turing \"Alan Turing\"). As an answer to\nthe question \"Can computers think?\", he formulated the famous [Turing\ntest](/wiki/Turing_test \"Turing test\").[84] Turing believed that a computer\ncould be said to \"think\" when, if placed in a room by itself next to another\nroom that contained a human being and with the same questions being asked of\nboth the computer and the human being by a third party human being, the\ncomputer's responses turned out to be indistinguishable from those of the\nhuman. Essentially, Turing's view of machine intelligence followed the\nbehaviourist model of the mind—intelligence is as intelligence does. The\nTuring test has received many criticisms, among which the most famous is\nprobably the [Chinese room](/wiki/Chinese_room \"Chinese room\") [thought\nexperiment](/wiki/Thought_experiment \"Thought experiment\") formulated by\nSearle.[83]\n\nThe question about the possible sensitivity ([qualia](/wiki/Qualia \"Qualia\"))\nof computers or robots still remains open. Some computer scientists believe\nthat the specialty of AI can still make new contributions to the resolution of\nthe \"mind–body problem\". They suggest that based on the reciprocal influences\nbetween software and hardware that takes place in all computers, it is\npossible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand\nthe reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain\n([wetware](/wiki/Wetware_\\(brain\\) \"Wetware \\(brain\\)\")).[85]\n\n###\nPsychology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Psychology\")]\n\nMain article: [Psychology](/wiki/Psychology \"Psychology\")\n\nPsychology is the science that investigates mental states directly. It uses\ngenerally empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like\n[joy](/wiki/Joy \"Joy\"), [fear](/wiki/Fear \"Fear\") or\n[obsessions](/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder \"Obsessive–compulsive\ndisorder\"). Psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to\neach other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism.[86]\n\nAn example of this is the [psychology of perception](/wiki/Perception\n\"Perception\"). Scientists working in this field have discovered general\nprinciples of the [perception of forms](/wiki/Form_perception \"Form\nperception\"). A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in\nthe same direction are perceived as related to each other.[78] This law\ndescribes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states.\nHowever, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states.\nThe laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the\nmind–body problem already described.\n\n### Cognitive\nscience[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Cognitive science\")]\n\n[Cognitive science](/wiki/Cognitive_science \"Cognitive science\") is the\ninterdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines\nwhat [cognition](/wiki/Cognition \"Cognition\") is, what it does, and how it\nworks. It includes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing\non how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties\nsuch as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous\nsystems (human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers). Cognitive\nscience consists of multiple research disciplines, including\n[psychology](/wiki/Psychology \"Psychology\"), [artificial\nintelligence](/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\"),\n[philosophy](/wiki/Philosophy \"Philosophy\"), [neuroscience](/wiki/Neuroscience\n\"Neuroscience\"), [linguistics](/wiki/Linguistics \"Linguistics\"),\n[anthropology](/wiki/Anthropology \"Anthropology\"), [sociology](/wiki/Sociology\n\"Sociology\"), and [education](/wiki/Education \"Education\").[87] It spans many\nlevels of analysis, from low-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-\nlevel logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organisation.\n[Rowlands](/wiki/Mark_Rowlands \"Mark Rowlands\") argues that cognition is\nenactive, embodied, embedded, affective and (potentially) extended. The\nposition is taken that the \"classical sandwich\" of cognition sandwiched\nbetween perception and action is artificial; cognition has to be seen as a\nproduct of a strongly coupled interaction that cannot be divided this\nway.[88][89]\n\n## Philosophy of mind in the continental\ntradition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition\")]\n\nMost of the discussion in this article has focused on one style or tradition\nof philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called [analytic\nphilosophy](/wiki/Analytic_philosophy \"Analytic philosophy\") (sometimes\ndescribed as Anglo-American philosophy).[90] Many other schools of thought\nexist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label\nof [continental philosophy](/wiki/Continental_philosophy \"Continental\nphilosophy\").[90] In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, in\nrelation to the philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this\nlabel ([phenomenology](/wiki/Phenomenology_\\(philosophy\\) \"Phenomenology\n\\(philosophy\\)\"), [existentialism](/wiki/Existentialism \"Existentialism\"),\netc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they\nfocus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms\nof understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically\nto the discussion of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp\nthe concepts of [thought](/wiki/Thought \"Thought\") and [perceptual\nexperience](/wiki/Experience \"Experience\") in some sense that does not merely\ninvolve the analysis of linguistic forms.[90]\n\nImmanuel Kant's _[Critique of Pure Reason](/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason\n\"Critique of Pure Reason\")_ , first published in 1781 and presented again with\nmajor revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will\nlater become known as the philosophy of mind. Kant's first\n[critique](/wiki/Critique \"Critique\") is generally recognized as among the\nmost significant works of [modern philosophy](/wiki/Modern_philosophy \"Modern\nphilosophy\") in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both\n[continental](/wiki/Continental_philosophy \"Continental philosophy\") and\nanalytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of\n[transcendental](/wiki/Transcendental_idealism \"Transcendental idealism\")\nconsciousness, or the life of the mind as conceived through universal\n[categories](/wiki/Category_\\(Kant\\) \"Category \\(Kant\\)\") of consciousness.\n\nIn [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel](/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel \"Georg\nWilhelm Friedrich Hegel\")'s _Philosophy of Mind_ (frequently translated as\n_Philosophy of Spirit_ or [Geist](/wiki/Geist \"Geist\")),[91] the third part of\nhis _[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical\nSciences](/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_the_Philosophical_Sciences \"Encyclopedia of\nthe Philosophical Sciences\")_ , Hegel discusses three distinct types of mind:\nthe \"subjective mind/spirit\", the mind of an individual; the \"objective\nmind/spirit\", the mind of society and of the State; and the \"Absolute\nmind/spirit\", the position of religion, art, and philosophy. See also Hegel's\n_[The Phenomenology of Spirit](/wiki/The_Phenomenology_of_Spirit \"The\nPhenomenology of Spirit\")_. Nonetheless, Hegel's work differs radically from\nthe style of [Anglo-American](/wiki/Anglosphere \"Anglosphere\") philosophy of\nmind.\n\nIn 1896, [Henri Bergson](/wiki/Henri_Bergson \"Henri Bergson\") made in _[Matter\nand Memory](/wiki/Matter_and_Memory \"Matter and Memory\")_ \"Essay on the\nrelation of body and spirit\" a forceful case for the ontological difference of\nbody and mind by reducing the problem to the more definite one of memory, thus\nallowing for a solution built on the _empirical test case_ of\n[aphasia](/wiki/Aphasia \"Aphasia\").\n\nIn modern times, the two main schools that have developed in response or\nopposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism.\nPhenomenology, founded by [Edmund Husserl](/wiki/Edmund_Husserl \"Edmund\nHusserl\"), focuses on the contents of the human mind (see [noema](/wiki/Noema\n\"Noema\")) and how processes shape our experiences.[92] Existentialism, a\nschool of thought founded upon the work of [Søren\nKierkegaard](/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard \"Søren Kierkegaard\"), focuses on\nHuman predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive.\nExistential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy\n(they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in\nits fullest forms in the work of [Martin Heidegger](/wiki/Martin_Heidegger\n\"Martin Heidegger\"), [Jean-Paul Sartre](/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre \"Jean-Paul\nSartre\"), [Simone de Beauvoir](/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir \"Simone de Beauvoir\")\nand [Maurice Merleau-Ponty](/wiki/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty \"Maurice Merleau-\nPonty\").

In these schools a clear\ndifference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal\nand undergoes [samsara](/wiki/Samsara \"Samsara\"), a cycle of death and\nrebirth. The [Nyāya](/wiki/Ny%C4%81ya \"Nyāya\") school argued that qualities\nsuch as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by\nanything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong\nto a non-material self, the [atman](/wiki/%C4%80tman_\\(Hinduism\\) \"Ātman\n\\(Hinduism\\)\").[93] Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as\n[moksha](/wiki/Moksha \"Moksha\"), liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.\n\n#### Vedanta monistic\nidealism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=39\n\"Edit section: Vedanta monistic idealism\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Raja_Ravi_Varma_-\n_Sankaracharya.jpg/147px-Raja_Ravi_Varma_-\n_Sankaracharya.jpg)](/wiki/File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nŚaṅkara\n\nIn the [Advaita Vedanta](/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta \"Advaita Vedanta\") of the 8th\ncentury Indian philosopher [Śaṅkara](/wiki/%C5%9Aa%E1%B9%85kara \"Śaṅkara\"),\nthe mind, body and world are all held to be the same unchanging eternal\nconscious entity called [Brahman](/wiki/Brahman \"Brahman\"). Advaita, which\nmeans non-dualism, holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute\n[consciousness](/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\"). The fact that the world\nseems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion, or\n[Maya](/wiki/Maya_\\(illusion\\) \"Maya \\(illusion\\)\"). The only thing that\nexists is [Brahman](/wiki/Brahman \"Brahman\"), which is described as\n[Satchitananda](/wiki/Satchitananda \"Satchitananda\") (Being, consciousness and\nbliss). Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states \"Brahman is\nalone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is\nnot different from Brahman.\"[94]\n\nAnother form of monistic Vedanta is [Vishishtadvaita](/wiki/Vishishtadvaita\n\"Vishishtadvaita\") (qualified non-dualism) as posited by the eleventh century\nphilosopher [Ramanuja](/wiki/Ramanuja \"Ramanuja\"). Ramanuja criticized Advaita\nVedanta by arguing that consciousness is always\n[intentional](/wiki/Intentionality \"Intentionality\") and that it is also\nalways a property of something. Ramanuja's Brahman is defined by a\nmultiplicity of qualities and properties in a single monistic entity. This\ndoctrine is called \"[samanadhikaranya](/wiki/Samanadhikaranya\n\"Samanadhikaranya\")\" (several things in a common substrate).[95]\n\n####\nMaterialism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=40\n\"Edit section: Materialism\")]\n\nArguably the first exposition of [empirical](/wiki/Empiricism \"Empiricism\")\n[materialism](/wiki/Materialism \"Materialism\") in the history of philosophy is\nin the [Cārvāka](/wiki/C%C4%81rv%C4%81ka \"Cārvāka\") school (also called\nLokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter\n(which they defined as being made up of the [four\nelements](/wiki/Four_elements \"Four elements\")), including God and the soul.\nTherefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made\nup of atoms.

The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as\nan impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of\na single fixed self.

This seems to reject both [causal\ndeterminist](/wiki/Determinism \"Determinism\") and\n[epiphenomenalist](/wiki/Epiphenomenalism \"Epiphenomenalism\") conceptions of\nmind.[98]\n\n#### Abhidharma theories of\nmind[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=42 \"Edit\nsection: Abhidharma theories of mind\")]\n\nThree centuries after the death of the Buddha (c. 150 BCE) saw the growth of a\nlarge body of literature called the [Abhidharma](/wiki/Abhidharma\n\"Abhidharma\") in several contending [Buddhist schools](/wiki/Buddhist_schools\n\"Buddhist schools\"). In the Abhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought\nis defined as [prapañca](/wiki/Prapa%C3%B1ca \"Prapañca\") ('conceptual\nproliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is bound up\nin multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This\nproliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of\nconcepts like [self](/wiki/Self \"Self\") and [other](/wiki/Other_\\(philosophy\\)\n\"Other \\(philosophy\\)\") upon an ever changing stream of aggregate\nphenomena.[98] In this conception of mind no strict distinction is made\nbetween the conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various\nphenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense\nmodalities, five for the [five senses](/wiki/Five_senses \"Five senses\") and\nsixth for perception of mental phenomena.[98] The arising of cognitive\nawareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental\nfaculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness'\n(_manovijñāna_) and attention (_āvartana_), the picking out of objects out of\nthe constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.\n\nRejection of a permanent agent eventually led to the philosophical problems of\nthe seeming continuity of mind and also of explaining how\n[rebirth](/wiki/Rebirth_\\(Buddhism\\) \"Rebirth \\(Buddhism\\)\") and\n[karma](/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism \"Karma in Buddhism\") continue to be relevant\ndoctrines without an eternal mind. This challenge was met by the\n[Theravāda](/wiki/Therav%C4%81da \"Theravāda\") school by introducing the\nconcept of mind as a factor of existence. This \"life-stream\"\n([Bhavanga](/wiki/Bhavanga \"Bhavanga\")-sota) is an undercurrent forming the\ncondition of being. The continuity of a karmic \"person\" is therefore assured\nin the form of a [mindstream](/wiki/Mindstream \"Mindstream\") (citta-santana),\na series of flowing mental moments arising from the subliminal life-continuum\nmind ([Bhavanga](/wiki/Bhavanga \"Bhavanga\")-citta), mental content, and\nattention.[98]\n\n#### Indian\nMahayana[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: Indian Mahayana\")]\n\nThe [Sautrāntika](/wiki/Sautr%C4%81ntika \"Sautrāntika\") school held a form of\n[phenomenalism](/wiki/Phenomenalism \"Phenomenalism\") that saw the world as\nimperceptible. It held that external objects exist only as a support for\ncognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced\nthe later [Yogācāra](/wiki/Yog%C4%81c%C4%81ra \"Yogācāra\") school of [Mahayana\nBuddhism](/wiki/Mahayana_Buddhism \"Mahayana Buddhism\"). The Yogācāra school is\noften called the mind-only school because of its\n[internalist](/wiki/Internalism_and_externalism#Philosophy_of_mind\n\"Internalism and externalism\") stance that consciousness is the ultimate\nexisting reality. The works of [Vasubandhu](/wiki/Vasubandhu \"Vasubandhu\")\nhave often been interpreted as arguing for some form of\n[Idealism](/wiki/Idealism \"Idealism\"). Vasubandhu uses the [dream\nargument](/wiki/Dream_argument \"Dream argument\") and a\n[mereological](/wiki/Mereology \"Mereology\") refutation of atomism to attack\nthe reality of external objects as anything other than mental entities.[99]\nScholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include\nphenomenalism, [neutral monism](/wiki/Neutral_monism \"Neutral monism\") and\n[realist\nphenomenology](/wiki/Phenomenology_\\(philosophy\\)#Realist_phenomenology\n\"Phenomenology \\(philosophy\\)\").\n\nThe Indian [Mahayana schools](/wiki/Schools_of_Buddhism#Mahāyāna_schools\n\"Schools of Buddhism\") were divided on the issue of the possibility of\nreflexive awareness (_[svasaṃvedana](/wiki/Svasa%E1%B9%83vedana\n\"Svasaṃvedana\")_). [Dharmakīrti](/wiki/Dharmak%C4%ABrti \"Dharmakīrti\")\naccepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogācāra school,\ncomparing it to a lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other\nobjects. This was strictly rejected by [Mādhyamika](/wiki/M%C4%81dhyamika\n\"Mādhyamika\") scholars like [Candrakīrti](/wiki/Candrak%C4%ABrti\n\"Candrakīrti\"). Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and\nmental events are characterized by [emptiness](/wiki/Shunyata \"Shunyata\"),\nthey argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate\nreality since that would mean it was self-validating and therefore not\ncharacterized by emptiness.[98] These views were ultimately reconciled by the\n8th century thinker [Śāntarakṣita](/wiki/%C5%9A%C4%81ntarak%E1%B9%A3ita\n\"Śāntarakṣita\"). In Śāntarakṣita's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra\nviews of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the\n[two truths doctrine](/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine \"Two truths doctrine\"). Thus\nhe states: \"By relying on the Mind-Only system, know that external entities do\nnot exist. And by relying on this Middle Way system, know that no self exists\nat all, even in that [mind].\" [100]\n\nThe Yogācāra school also developed the theory of the [repository\nconsciousness](/wiki/Vij%C3%B1%C4%81na#Eight_vijñānas \"Vijñāna\")\n(_ālayavijñāna_) to explain continuity of mind in\n[rebirth](/wiki/Rebirth_\\(Buddhism\\) \"Rebirth \\(Buddhism\\)\") and accumulation\nof [karma](/wiki/Karma \"Karma\"). This repository consciousness acts as a\nstorehouse for karmic seeds ([bija](/wiki/B%C4%ABja \"Bīja\")) when all other\nsenses are absent during the process of death and rebirth as well as being the\ncausal potentiality of [dharmic\nphenomena](/wiki/Dharma_\\(Buddhism\\)#Dharmas_in_Buddhist_phenomenology \"Dharma\n\\(Buddhism\\)\").[98] Thus according to [B. Alan Wallace](/wiki/B._Alan_Wallace\n\"B. Alan Wallace\"):\n\n> No constituents of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into mental\n> states and processes. Such subjective experiences do not emerge from the\n> body, but neither do they emerge from nothing. Rather, all objective mental\n> appearances arise from the substrate, and all subjective mental states and\n> processes arise from the substrate consciousness.[101]\n\n#### Tibetan\nBuddhism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=44\n\"Edit section: Tibetan Buddhism\")]\n\n[Tibetan Buddhist](/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhist \"Tibetan Buddhist\") theories of mind\nevolved directly from the Indian Mahayana views. Thus the founder of the\n[Gelug](/wiki/Gelug \"Gelug\") school, [Je Tsongkhapa](/wiki/Je_Tsongkhapa \"Je\nTsongkhapa\") discusses the Yogācāra system of the [Eight\nConsciousnesses](/wiki/Eight_Consciousnesses \"Eight Consciousnesses\") in his\n_Explanation of the Difficult Points_.[102] He would later come to repudiate\n[Śāntarakṣita](/wiki/%C5%9A%C4%81ntarak%E1%B9%A3ita \"Śāntarakṣita\")'s\npragmatic [idealism](/wiki/Idealism \"Idealism\"). According to the [14th Dalai\nLama](/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama \"14th Dalai Lama\") the mind can be defined \"as an\nentity that has the nature of mere experience, that is, 'clarity and knowing'.\nIt is the knowing nature, or agency, that is called mind, and this is non-\nmaterial.\"[103] The simultaneously dual nature of mind is as follows:\n\n    \n\n    1\\. **Clarity** (_gsal_) – The mental activity which produces cognitive phenomena (_snang-ba_).\n    2\\. **Knowing** (_rig_) – The mental activity of perceiving cognitive phenomena.\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama has also explicitly laid out his theory of mind as\n**experiential dualism** which is described above under the different types of\ndualism.[52]\n\nBecause Tibetan philosophy of mind is ultimately\n[soteriological](/wiki/Soteriology \"Soteriology\"), it focuses on meditative\npractices such as [Dzogchen](/wiki/Dzogchen \"Dzogchen\") and\n[Mahamudra](/wiki/Mahamudra \"Mahamudra\") that allow a practitioner to\nexperience the true reflexive nature of their mind directly. This unobstructed\nknowledge of one's primordial, empty and non-dual [Buddha\nnature](/wiki/Buddha_nature \"Buddha nature\") is called [rigpa](/wiki/Rigpa\n\"Rigpa\"). The mind's innermost nature is described among various schools as\npure luminosity or \"clear light\" (['od gsal](/wiki/%C3%96sel_\\(yoga\\) \"Ösel\n\\(yoga\\)\")) and is often compared to a crystal ball or a mirror. [Sogyal\nRinpoche](/wiki/Sogyal_Rinpoche \"Sogyal Rinpoche\") speaks of mind thus:\n\"Imagine a sky, empty, spacious, and pure from the beginning; its essence is\nlike this. Imagine a sun, luminous, clear, unobstructed, and spontaneously\npresent; its nature is like this.\"\n\n#### Zen\nBuddhism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=45\n\"Edit section: Zen Buddhism\")]\n\nThe central issue in Chinese Zen philosophy of mind is in the difference\nbetween the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind. Chinese Chan master\n[Huangpo](/wiki/Huangbo_Xiyun \"Huangbo Xiyun\") described the mind as without\nbeginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was\nobscured by attachment to form and concepts.[104] The pure Buddha-mind is thus\nable to see things \"as they truly are\", as absolute and non-dual \"thusness\"\n([Tathatā](/wiki/Tathat%C4%81/Dharmat%C4%81 \"Tathatā/Dharmatā\")). This non-\nconceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no\ndifference between a defiled and a pure mind, as well as no difference between\n[samsara](/wiki/Samsara \"Samsara\") and [nirvana](/wiki/Nirvana\n\"Nirvana\").[104]\n\nIn the [Shobogenzo](/wiki/Shobogenzo \"Shobogenzo\"), the Japanese philosopher\n[Dogen](/wiki/Dogen \"Dogen\") argued that body and mind are neither\nontologically nor phenomenologically distinct but are characterized by a\noneness called _shin jin_ (bodymind). According to Dogen, \"casting off body\nand mind\" (_Shinjin datsuraku_) in [zazen](/wiki/Zazen \"Zazen\") will allow one\nto experience things-as-they-are (_genjokoan_) which is the nature of original\nenlightenment (_[hongaku](/wiki/Hongaku \"Hongaku\")_).[105]\n\n## Topics related to philosophy of\nmind[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=46 \"Edit\nsection: Topics related to philosophy of mind\")]\n\nThere are countless subjects that are affected by the ideas developed in the\nphilosophy of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of\n[death](/wiki/Death \"Death\") and its definitive character, the nature of\n[emotion](/wiki/Emotion \"Emotion\"), of [perception](/wiki/Perception\n\"Perception\") and of [memory](/wiki/Memory \"Memory\"). Questions about what a\n[person](/wiki/Person \"Person\") is and what his or her\n[identity](/wiki/Personal_identity \"Personal identity\") consists of also have\nmuch to do with the philosophy of mind. There are two subjects that, in\nconnection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention:\n[free will](/wiki/Free_will \"Free will\") and the\n[self](/wiki/Self_\\(philosophy\\) \"Self \\(philosophy\\)\").[2]\n\n### Free\nwill[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=47 \"Edit\nsection: Free will\")]\n\nMain article: [Free will](/wiki/Free_will \"Free will\")\n\nIn the context of philosophy of mind, the problem of free will takes on\nrenewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic\n[determinists](/wiki/Determinism \"Determinism\").[2] According to this\nposition, natural laws completely determine the course of the material world.\nMental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which\nmeans human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural\nlaws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by\nthemselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not\nfree.[106]\n\nThis argumentation is rejected, on the one hand, by the\n[compatibilists](/wiki/Compatibilism \"Compatibilism\"). Those who adopt this\nposition suggest that the question \"Are we free?\" can only be answered once we\nhave determined what the term \"free\" means. The opposite of \"free\" is not\n\"caused\" but \"compelled\" or \"coerced\". It is not appropriate to identify\nfreedom with indetermination. A free act is one where the agent could have\ndone otherwise if it had chosen otherwise. In this sense a person can be free\neven though determinism is true.[106] The most important compatibilist in the\nhistory of the philosophy was [David Hume](/wiki/David_Hume \"David\nHume\").[107] More recently, this position is defended, for example, by [Daniel\nDennett](/wiki/Daniel_Dennett \"Daniel Dennett\").[108]\n\nOn the other hand, there are also many\n[incompatibilists](/wiki/Incompatibilism \"Incompatibilism\") who reject the\nargument because they believe that the will is free in a stronger sense called\n[libertarianism](/wiki/Libertarianism_\\(metaphysics\\) \"Libertarianism\n\\(metaphysics\\)\").[106] These philosophers affirm the course of the world is\neither a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is\nintercepted by physically independent agency,[109] b) determined by\nindeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural\nlaw in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible\nagency.[110] Under Libertarianism, the will does not have to be deterministic\nand, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b)\naccuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They\nargue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire\nwhat we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we\nare not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not\nfree.[106]\n\n### Self[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=48\n\"Edit section: Self\")]\n\nMain article: [Philosophy of self](/wiki/Philosophy_of_self \"Philosophy of\nself\")\n\nThe philosophy of mind also has important consequences for the concept of\n\"self\". If by \"self\" or \"I\" one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of\nthe _person_ , some modern philosophers of mind, such as [Daniel\nDennett](/wiki/Daniel_Dennett \"Daniel Dennett\") believe that no such thing\nexists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, the self is considered\nan illusion.[111] The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives\nfrom the idea of an [immaterial soul](/wiki/Soul \"Soul\"). Such an idea is\nunacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their\ngeneral skepticism of the concept of \"self\" as postulated by [David\nHume](/wiki/David_Hume \"David Hume\"), who could never catch himself _not_\ndoing, thinking or feeling anything.[112] However, in the light of empirical\nresults from [developmental psychology](/wiki/Developmental_psychology\n\"Developmental psychology\"), [developmental\nbiology](/wiki/Developmental_biology \"Developmental biology\") and\n[neuroscience](/wiki/Neuroscience \"Neuroscience\"), the idea of an essential\ninconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed\nover changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.[113]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=49 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Animal consciousness](/wiki/Animal_consciousness \"Animal consciousness\")\n  * [Artificial consciousness](/wiki/Artificial_consciousness \"Artificial consciousness\")\n  * [Collective intentionality](/wiki/Collective_intentionality \"Collective intentionality\")\n  * [Outline of human intelligence](/wiki/Outline_of_human_intelligence \"Outline of human intelligence\")\n  * [Outline of thought](/wiki/Outline_of_thought \"Outline of thought\")\n  * [Theory of mind in animals](/wiki/Theory_of_mind_in_animals \"Theory of mind in animals\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philosophy_of_mind&action=edit&section=50\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Oliver Elbs, _Neuro-Esthetics: Mapological foundations and applications (Map 2003)_ , (Munich 2005)\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ Kim, J.
