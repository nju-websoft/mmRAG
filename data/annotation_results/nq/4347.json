This figure\nincludes the [oil sands](/wiki/Oil_sands \"Oil sands\") reserves that are\nestimated by government regulators to be economically producible at current\nprices using current technology.[1] According to this figure, Canada's\nreserves are third only to [Venezuela](/wiki/Oil_reserves_in_Venezuela \"Oil\nreserves in Venezuela\") and [Saudi Arabia](/wiki/Oil_reserves_in_Saudi_Arabia\n\"Oil reserves in Saudi Arabia\"). Over 95% of these reserves are in the [oil\nsands](/wiki/Oil_sands \"Oil sands\") deposits in the province of\n[Alberta](/wiki/Alberta \"Alberta\").[2] Alberta contains nearly all of Canada's\noil sands and much of its conventional oil reserves. The balance is\nconcentrated in several other provinces and territories.\n[Saskatchewan](/wiki/Saskatchewan \"Saskatchewan\") and offshore areas of\n[Newfoundland](/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador \"Newfoundland and Labrador\") in\nparticular have substantial oil production and reserves.[3] Alberta has 39% of\nCanada's remaining conventional oil reserves, offshore Newfoundland 28% and\nSaskatchewan 27%, but if oil sands are included, Alberta's share is over\n98%.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Status\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 External links\n  * 4 References\n\n##\nStatus[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oil_reserves_in_Canada&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Status\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Canadian_oil_production_1950_to_2030.svg/220px-\nCanadian_oil_production_1950_to_2030.svg.png)](/w/index.php?title=File:Canadian_oil_production_1950_to_2030.svg&lang=en)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Canadian_oil_production_1950_to_2030.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCanadian conventional oil production peaked in 1973, but oil sands production\nis forecast to increase to at least 2020\n\nCanada has a highly sophisticated energy industry and is both an importer and\nexporter of oil and refined products. In 2006, in addition to producing 1.2\nbillion barrels (190×10~~^~~ 6 m3), Canada imported 440 million barrels\n(70×10~~^~~ 6 m3), consumed 800 million barrels (130×10~~^~~ 6 m3) itself, and\nexported 840 million barrels (134×10~~^~~ 6 m3) to the U.S.[2] The excess of\nexports over imports was 400 million barrels (64×10~~^~~ 6 m3). Over 99% of\nCanadian oil exports are sent to the United States, and Canada is the United\nStates' largest supplier of oil.[5]\n\nThe decision of accounting 174 billion barrels (28×10~~^~~ 9 m3) of the\nAlberta oil sands deposits as proven reserves was made by the [Energy\nResources Conservation Board](/wiki/Energy_Resources_Conservation_Board\n\"Energy Resources Conservation Board\") (ERCB), now known as the [Alberta\nEnergy and Utilities Board](/wiki/Alberta_Energy_and_Utilities_Board \"Alberta\nEnergy and Utilities Board\") (AEUB).[6] Although now widely accepted, this\naddition was controversial at the time because oil sands contain an extremely\nheavy form of crude oil known as [bitumen](/wiki/Bitumen \"Bitumen\") which will\nnot flow toward a well under reservoir conditions. Instead, it must be mined,\nheated, or diluted with solvents to allow it to be produced, and must be\nupgraded to lighter oil to be usable by refineries.[6] Historically known as\nbituminous sands or sometimes as \"tar sands\", the deposits were exposed as\nmajor rivers cut through the oil-bearing formations to reveal the bitumen in\nthe river banks. In recent years technological breakthroughs have overcome the\neconomical and technical difficulties of producing the oil sands, and by 2007\n64% of Alberta's petroleum production of 1.86 million barrels per day (296,000\nm3/d) was from oil sands rather than conventional oil fields. The ERCB\nestimates that by 2017 oil sands production will make up 88% of Alberta's\npredicted oil production of 3.4 million barrels per day (540,000 m3/d).[6]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/WTI_Crude_Oil_Price_1998-2007.png/220px-\nWTI_Crude_Oil_Price_1998-2007.png)](/wiki/File:WTI_Crude_Oil_Price_1998-2007.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:WTI_Crude_Oil_Price_1998-2007.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe fivefold increase in oil prices from 1998 to 2007 made Canadian oil sands\nproduction profitable.\n\nAnalysts estimate that a price of $30 to $40 per barrel is required to make\nnew oil sands production profitable.[2] In recent years prices have greatly\nexceeded those levels and the Alberta government expects $116 billion worth of\nnew oil sands projects to be undertaken between 2008 and 2017.[6] However the\nbiggest constraint on oil sands development is a serious labor and housing\nshortage in Alberta as a whole and the oil sands centre of [Fort\nMcMurray](/wiki/Fort_McMurray \"Fort McMurray\") in particular. According to\n[Statistics Canada](/wiki/Statistics_Canada \"Statistics Canada\"), by\nSeptember, 2006 unemployment rates in Alberta had fallen to record low\nlevels[7] and per-capita incomes had risen to double the Canadian average.\nAnother hurdle has been Canada's capacity to rapidly increase its export\npipelines. The [National Energy Board](/wiki/National_Energy_Board \"National\nEnergy Board\") indicated that exporters faced pipeline\n[apportionment](/wiki/Rationing \"Rationing\") in 2007.[8] However, surging\ncrude oil prices sparked a jump in applications for oil pipelines in 2007, and\nnew pipelines were planned to carry Canadian oil as far south as U.S.\nrefineries on the Gulf of Mexico.[9]\n\nUp until 2010 Canada was the only major oil producer in the Organization for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development ([OECD](/wiki/OECD \"OECD\")) to have an\nincrease in oil production in recent years. Production in the other major OECD\nproducers (the United States, United Kingdom, Norway and Mexico) at that time\nhave been declining, as was conventional oil production in Canada. Total crude\noil production in Canada was projected to increase by an average of 8.6\npercent per year from 2008 to 2011 as a result of new non-conventional oil\nprojects.[10]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oil_reserves_in_Canada&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Athabasca Oil Sands](/wiki/Athabasca_Oil_Sands \"Athabasca Oil Sands\")\n  * [History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)](/wiki/History_of_the_petroleum_industry_in_Canada_\\(oil_sands_and_heavy_oil\\) \"History of the petroleum industry in Canada \\(oil sands and heavy oil\\)\")\n\n## External\nlinks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oil_reserves_in_Canada&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: External links\")]\n\n  * [Map of Canadian Oil and gas infrastructure](http://www.oilandgasinfrastructure.com/home/oilandgasnorthamerica/canada)\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Oil_reserves_in_Canada&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** EIA (2015).
