[Fashion\nhistorians](/wiki/History_of_fashion_design \"History of fashion design\")\nascribe the origins of the little black dress to the 1920s designs of [Coco\nChanel](/wiki/Coco_Chanel \"Coco Chanel\") and [Jean Patou](/wiki/Jean_Patou\n\"Jean Patou\")[1] intended to be long-lasting, versatile, affordable,\naccessible to the widest market possible and in a neutral colour. Its ubiquity\nis such that it is often simply referred to as the \"LBD\".[2][3][4]\n\nThe \"little black dress\" is considered essential to a complete\n[wardrobe](/wiki/Clothing \"Clothing\") by many women and fashion observers, who\nbelieve it a \"rule of fashion\" that every woman should own a simple, elegant\nblack dress that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion: for\nexample, worn with a jacket and pumps for daytime business wear or with more\nornate jewelry and accessories for evening or a formal event such as a\n[wedding](/wiki/Wedding \"Wedding\") or a [ball](/wiki/Ball_\\(dance_party\\)\n\"Ball \\(dance party\\)\"). Because it is meant to be a staple of the wardrobe\nfor a number of years, the style of the little black dress ideally should be\nas simple as possible: a short black dress that is too clearly part of a trend\nwould not qualify because it would soon appear dated.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Famous little black dresses\n  * 3 In popular culture\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 Further reading\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Little_black_dress&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

In the early 18th\ncentury, black represented romance and artistry. As [Ann\nDemeulemeester](/wiki/Ann_Demeulemeester \"Ann Demeulemeester\") said of it,\n\"Black is poetic. How do you imagine a poet? In a bright yellow jacket?\nProbably not.\" In the early 19th century, black was adopted by the\n[Romantics](/wiki/Romantics \"Romantics\") such as [Byron](/wiki/Byron \"Byron\"),\n[Shelley](/wiki/Shelley \"Shelley\"), and [Keats](/wiki/Keats \"Keats\"), due to\nits melancholic aura. As the [Victorian Era](/wiki/Victorian_Era \"Victorian\nEra\") began, black transitions from a color of art to one of grief and\nmourning - widows were expected to wear black for at least four years - and\nalso for service livery, as the uniform for [maids](/wiki/Maid \"Maid\").\n\n  \nIn 1926 [Gabrielle \"Coco\" Chanel](/wiki/Gabrielle_Chanel \"Gabrielle Chanel\")\npublished a picture of a short, simple black dress in American\n_[Vogue](/wiki/Vogue_\\(magazine\\) \"Vogue \\(magazine\\)\")_. It was calf-length,\nstraight and decorated only by a few diagonal lines. _Vogue_ called it\n\"Chanel's Ford\". Like the [Model T](/wiki/Model_T \"Model T\"), the little black\ndress was simple and accessible for women of all social classes. _Vogue_ also\nsaid that the LBD would become \"a sort of uniform for all women of taste\".[5]\nThis, as well as other designs by the house of Chanel helped disassociate\nblack with mourning, and reinvent it as the uniform of the high-class,\nwealthy, and chic. As Coco herself proclaimed, \"I imposed black; it's still\ngoing strong today, for black wipes out everything else around.\"[6] Chanel is\ncredited with the creation and popularization of the Little Black Dress, and\nrightfully so.\n\nThe little black dress continued to be popular through the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\"), predominantly through\nits economy and elegance, albeit with the line lengthened somewhat.\n[Hollywood](/wiki/Hollywood \"Hollywood\")'s influence on fashion helped the\nlittle black dress's popularity, but for more practical reasons: as\n[Technicolor](/wiki/Technicolor \"Technicolor\") films became more common,\nfilmmakers relied on little black dresses because other colors looked\ndistorted on screen and botched the coloring process. During [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the style continued in part due to\nwidespread rationing of textiles, and in part as a common uniform\n(accessorized for businesswear) for civilian women entering the workforce.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/12-promotional-\nmodels-Fenasucro-2010.JPG/200px-12-promotional-models-\nFenasucro-2010.JPG)](/wiki/File:12-promotional-models-Fenasucro-2010.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:12-promotional-models-Fenasucro-2010.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nModels wearing little black dresses in [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil \"Brazil\"), 2010\n\nThe rise of [Dior's \"New Look\"](/wiki/The_New_Look_\\(style\\) \"The New Look\n\\(style\\)\") in the post-war era and the sexual conservatism of the 1950s\nreturned the little black dress to its roots as a uniform and a symbol of the\ndangerous woman. Hollywood [femme fatales](/wiki/Femme_fatale \"Femme fatale\")\nand [fallen women](/wiki/Fallen_women \"Fallen women\") characters were\nportrayed often in black halter-style dresses in contrast to the more\nconservative dresses of housewives or more wholesome Hollywood stars.\nSynthetic fibres made popular in the 1940s and 1950s broadened the\navailability and affordability of many designs.\n\nThe generation gap of the 1960s created a dichotomy in the design of the\nlittle black dress. The younger \"[mod](/wiki/Mod \"Mod\")\" generation preferred,\nin general, a miniskirt on their versions of the dress and designers catering\nto the [youth culture](/wiki/Youth_culture \"Youth culture\") continued to push\nthe envelope - shortening the skirt even more, creating cutouts or slits in\nthe skirt or bodice of the dress, using sheer fabrics such as\n[netting](/wiki/Netting \"Netting\") or [tulle](/wiki/Tulle \"Tulle\"). Many women\naspired to simple black sheath dresses similar to the [black Givenchy\ndress](/wiki/Black_Givenchy_dress_of_Audrey_Hepburn \"Black Givenchy dress of\nAudrey Hepburn\") worn by [Audrey Hepburn](/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn \"Audrey\nHepburn\") in the film _[Breakfast at\nTiffany's](/wiki/Breakfast_at_Tiffany%27s_\\(film\\) \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\n\\(film\\)\")_.\n\nThe popularity of casual fabrics, especially knits, for dress and business\nwear during the 1980s brought the little black dress back into vogue. Coupled\nwith the fitness craze, the new designs incorporated details already popular\nat the time such as broad shoulders or [peplums](/wiki/Overskirt \"Overskirt\"):\nlater in the decade and into the 1990s, simpler designs in a variety of\nlengths and fullness were popular. The\n[grunge](/wiki/Grunge#Presentation_and_fashion \"Grunge\") culture of the 1990s\nsaw the combination of the little black dress with both sandals and [combat\nboots](/wiki/Combat_boots \"Combat boots\"), though the dress itself remained\nsimple in cut and fabric.\n\nThe new glamour of the late 1990s led to new variations of the dress but, like\nthe 1950s and the 1970s, colour re-emerged as a factor in fashion and\nformalwear and repeatedly shows an aversion to black. The resurgence of body\nconscious clothing, muted colour schemes, and the reemergence of predominant\nblack, along with the retrospective trends of the 1980s in the late 2000s\npaved way to the return of interest to the dress.\n\n## Famous little black\ndresses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Little_black_dress&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Famous little black dresses\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Lena_Oslo3_cropped.jpg/150px-\nLena_Oslo3_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lena_Oslo3_cropped.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Lena_Oslo3_cropped.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Eurovision Song Contest](/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest \"Eurovision Song\nContest\") winner, [Lena](/wiki/Lena_Meyer-Landrut \"Lena Meyer-Landrut\"),\nsporting a little black dress and black [stockings](/wiki/Stocking \"Stocking\")\nwhile singing her winning song \"[Satellite](/wiki/Satellite_\\(Lena_Meyer-\nLandrut_song\\) \"Satellite \\(Lena Meyer-Landrut song\\)\")\".\n\nThe [black Givenchy dress of Audrey\nHepburn](/wiki/Black_Givenchy_dress_of_Audrey_Hepburn \"Black Givenchy dress of\nAudrey Hepburn\") as Holly Golightly in _[Breakfast at\nTiffany’s](/wiki/Breakfast_at_Tiffany%27s_\\(film\\) \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\n\\(film\\)\")_ , designed by [Hubert de Givenchy](/wiki/Hubert_de_Givenchy\n\"Hubert de Givenchy\"), epitomized the standard for wearing little black\ndresses accessorized with pearls (together called \"basic black\"), as was\nfrequently seen throughout the early 1960s. The dress set a record in 2006\nwhen it was auctioned for £410,000, six times its original estimate.[7] [Betty\nBoop](/wiki/Betty_Boop \"Betty Boop\"), a cartoon character based in part on the\n1920s' \"It Girl\" [Clara Bow](/wiki/Clara_Bow \"Clara Bow\"), was drawn wearing a\nlittle black dress in her early films, though with\n[Technicolor](/wiki/Technicolor \"Technicolor\") later, Betty's dress became\nred.[5]\n\n[Wallis Simpson](/wiki/Wallis_Simpson \"Wallis Simpson\"), Duchess of Windsor,\nwas known to own several little black dresses and said much in praise of the\ngarments.
