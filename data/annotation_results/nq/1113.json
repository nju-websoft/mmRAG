The company also ruled the\nbeginnings of the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") in\nIndia.[3]\n\nThe company received a [Royal Charter](/wiki/Royal_Charter \"Royal Charter\")\nfrom [Queen Elizabeth I](/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England \"Elizabeth I of\nEngland\") on 31 December 1600, making it the oldest among several similarly\nformed European [East India\nCompanies](/wiki/East_India_Company_\\(disambiguation\\) \"East India Company\n\\(disambiguation\\)\"). Wealthy merchants and [aristocrats](/wiki/Aristocracy\n\"Aristocracy\") owned the company's shares.[4] Initially the government owned\nno shares and had only indirect control.\n\nDuring its first century of operation, the focus of the company was trade, not\nthe building of an empire in India. Company interests turned from trade to\nterritory during the 18th century as the [Mughal Empire](/wiki/Mughal_Empire\n\"Mughal Empire\") declined in power and the East India Company struggled with\nits French counterpart, the [French East India\nCompany](/wiki/French_East_India_Company \"French East India Company\")\n(_Compagnie française des Indes orientales_) during the [Carnatic\nWars](/wiki/Carnatic_Wars \"Carnatic Wars\") of the 1740s and 1750s. The [Battle\nof Plassey](/wiki/Battle_of_Plassey \"Battle of Plassey\") and [Battle of\nBuxar](/wiki/Battle_of_Buxar \"Battle of Buxar\"), in which the British, led by\n[Robert Clive](/wiki/Robert_Clive \"Robert Clive\"), defeated the Indian powers,\nleft the company in control of [Bengal](/wiki/Bengal_Presidency \"Bengal\nPresidency\") and a major military and political power in India. In the\nfollowing decades it gradually increased the extent of the territories under\nits control, ruling the whole Indian subcontinent either directly or\nindirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force by its\n[Presidency armies](/wiki/Presidency_armies \"Presidency armies\"), much of\nwhich were composed of native Indian [sepoys](/wiki/Sepoys \"Sepoys\").\n\nBy 1803, at the height of its rule in India, the British East India company\nhad a private army of about 260,000—twice the size of the [British\nArmy](/wiki/British_Army \"British Army\").[5] The company eventually came to\nrule large areas of India with [its private armies](/wiki/Presidency_armies\n\"Presidency armies\"), exercising military power and assuming administrative\nfunctions.[6] [Company rule in India](/wiki/Company_rule_in_India \"Company\nrule in India\") effectively began in 1757 and lasted until 1858, when,\nfollowing the [Indian Rebellion of 1857](/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857\n\"Indian Rebellion of 1857\"), the [Government of India Act\n1858](/wiki/Government_of_India_Act_1858 \"Government of India Act 1858\") led\nto the [British Crown](/wiki/British_Crown \"British Crown\")'s assuming direct\ncontrol of the Indian subcontinent in the form of the new [British\nRaj](/wiki/British_Raj \"British Raj\").\n\nDespite frequent government intervention, the company had recurring problems\nwith its finances. It was dissolved in 1874 as a result of the [East India\nStock Dividend Redemption\nAct](/wiki/East_India_Stock_Dividend_Redemption_Act_1873 \"East India Stock\nDividend Redemption Act 1873\") passed one year earlier, as the Government of\nIndia Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The\nofficial [government machinery](/wiki/Machinery_of_government \"Machinery of\ngovernment\") of [British India](/wiki/British_India \"British India\") had\nassumed its governmental functions and absorbed its armies.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Founding\n  * 2 Early voyages to the East Indies\n  * 3 Foothold in India\n  * 4 Expansion\n    * 4.1 Japan\n    * 4.2 Mughal convoy piracy incident of 1695\n  * 5 Forming a complete monopoly\n    * 5.1 Trade monopoly\n    * 5.2 Saltpetre trade\n  * 6 Basis for the monopoly\n    * 6.1 Colonial monopoly\n    * 6.2 East India Company Army and Navy\n      * 6.2.1 Expansion and Conquest\n    * 6.3 Opium trade\n  * 7 Regulation of the company's affairs\n    * 7.1 Writers\n    * 7.2 Financial troubles\n    * 7.3 Regulating Acts of Parliament\n      * 7.3.1 East India Company Act 1773\n      * 7.3.2 East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act)\n      * 7.3.3 Act of 1786\n      * 7.3.4 East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act)\n      * 7.3.5 East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act)\n      * 7.3.6 Government of India Act 1833\n      * 7.3.7 English Education Act 1835\n      * 7.3.8 Government of India Act 1853\n  * 8 Indian Rebellion and disestablishment\n  * 9 Establishments in Britain\n  * 10 Legacy and criticisms\n  * 11 Symbols\n    * 11.1 Flags\n    * 11.2 Coat of arms\n    * 11.3 Merchant mark\n  * 12 Ships\n  * 13 Records\n  * 14 See also\n  * 15 Notes and references\n  * 16 Further reading\n    * 16.1 Historiography\n  * 17 External links\n\n## Founding[[edit](/w/index.php?title=East_India_Company&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Founding\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Jameslancaster.jpg/170px-\nJameslancaster.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jameslancaster.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jameslancaster.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[James Lancaster](/wiki/James_Lancaster \"James Lancaster\") commanded the first\nEast India Company voyage in 1601\n\nSoon after the defeat of the [Spanish Armada](/wiki/Spanish_Armada \"Spanish\nArmada\") in 1588, London merchants presented a petition to [Queen Elizabeth\nI](/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England \"Elizabeth I of England\") for permission to\nsail to the Indian Ocean.[7] Permission was granted, and on 10 April 1591\nthree ships sailed from [Torbay](/wiki/Torbay \"Torbay\") around the [Cape of\nGood Hope](/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope \"Cape of Good Hope\") to the [Arabian\nSea](/wiki/Arabian_Sea \"Arabian Sea\") on one of the earliest English overseas\nIndian expeditions. One of them, _[Edward\nBonaventure](/wiki/English_ship_Bonaventure_\\(1567\\) \"English ship Bonaventure\n\\(1567\\)\")_ , then sailed around [Cape Comorin](/wiki/Cape_Comorin \"Cape\nComorin\") to the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula \"Malay Peninsula\")\nand returned to England in 1594.[7]\n\nIn 1596, three more ships sailed east but were all lost at sea.[7] Three years\nlater, on 22 September 1599,[8] another group of merchants met and stated\ntheir intention \"to venture in the pretended voyage to the East Indies (the\nwhich it may please the Lord to prosper), and the sums that they will\nadventure\", committing £30,133.[9] Two days later, on 24 September, \"the\nAdventurers\" reconvened and resolved to apply to the Queen for support of the\nproject.[9] Although their first attempt had not been completely successful,\nthey nonetheless sought the Queen's unofficial approval to continue, bought\nships for their venture and increased their capital to £68,373.\n\nThe Adventurers convened again a year later.[7] This time they succeeded, and\non 31 December 1600, the Queen granted a [Royal Charter](/wiki/Royal_Charter\n\"Royal Charter\") to \"[George, Earl of\nCumberland](/wiki/George_Clifford,_3rd_Earl_of_Cumberland \"George Clifford,\n3rd Earl of Cumberland\"), and 215 [Knights](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\"),\n[Aldermen](/wiki/Aldermen \"Aldermen\"), and [Burgesses](/wiki/Burgess_\\(title\\)\n\"Burgess \\(title\\)\")\" under the name, **Governor and Company of Merchants of\nLondon trading with the East Indies**.[10] For a period of fifteen years the\ncharter awarded the newly formed company a monopoly on trade with all\ncountries east of the [Cape of Good Hope](/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope \"Cape of\nGood Hope\") and west of the [Straits of Magellan](/wiki/Straits_of_Magellan\n\"Straits of Magellan\").[10] Any traders in breach of the charter without a\nlicence from the company were liable to forfeiture of their ships and cargo\n(half of which went to the Crown and the other half to the company), as well\nas imprisonment at the \"royal pleasure\".[11]\n\nThe governance of the company was in the hands of one governor and 24\n[directors](/wiki/British_East_India_Company_directors \"British East India\nCompany directors\") or \"committees\", who made up the Court of Directors. They,\nin turn, reported to the Court of Proprietors, which appointed them. Ten\ncommittees reported to the Court of Directors.

Thereafter two ships, _Ascension_ and\n_Union_ (captained by Richard Rowles) sailed from Woolwich on 14 March\n1607–08.[15]\n\nInitially, the company struggled in the [spice trade](/wiki/Spice_trade \"Spice\ntrade\") because of the competition from the already well-established [Dutch\nEast India Company](/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company \"Dutch East India\nCompany\"). The company opened a [factory](/wiki/Factory_\\(trading_post\\)\n\"Factory \\(trading post\\)\") in [Bantam](/wiki/Bantam_\\(city\\) \"Bantam\n\\(city\\)\") on the first voyage, and imports of [pepper](/wiki/Black_pepper\n\"Black pepper\") from [Java](/wiki/Java \"Java\") were an important part of the\ncompany's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683.\nDuring this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at\n[Surat](/wiki/Surat \"Surat\"), which was established as a trade transit point\nin 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south\nIndia in the town of [Machilipatnam](/wiki/Machilipatnam \"Machilipatnam\") on\nthe [Coromandel Coast](/wiki/Coromandel_Coast \"Coromandel Coast\") of the [Bay\nof Bengal](/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal \"Bay of Bengal\"). The high profits reported by\nthe company after landing in India initially prompted [King James\nI](/wiki/James_I_of_England \"James I of England\") to grant subsidiary licences\nto other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter\ngiven to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that\nspecified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned\nunprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n## Foothold in\nIndia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=East_India_Company&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Foothold in India\")]\n\nSee also: [Establishment of English trade in Bengal\n(1600–1700)](/wiki/History_of_Kolkata#Establishment_of_English_trade_in_Bengal_.281600.E2.80.931700.29\n\"History of Kolkata\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Reddragonship.jpg/220px-\nReddragonship.jpg)](/wiki/File:Reddragonship.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Reddragonship.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[_Red Dragon_](/wiki/Red_Dragon_\\(1595\\) \"Red Dragon \\(1595\\)\") fought the\nPortuguese at the [Battle of Swally](/wiki/Battle_of_Swally \"Battle of\nSwally\") in 1612, and made several voyages to the [East\nIndies](/wiki/East_Indies \"East Indies\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Jahangir_investing_a_courtier_with_a_robe_of_honour_watched_by_Sir_Thomas_Roe%2C_English_ambassador_to_the_court_of_Jahangir_at_Agra_from_1615-18%2C_and_others.jpg/220px-\nJahangir_investing_a_courtier_with_a_robe_of_honour_watched_by_Sir_Thomas_Roe%2C_English_ambassador_to_the_court_of_Jahangir_at_Agra_from_1615-18%2C_and_others.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jahangir_investing_a_courtier_with_a_robe_of_honour_watched_by_Sir_Thomas_Roe,_English_ambassador_to_the_court_of_Jahangir_at_Agra_from_1615-18,_and_others.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jahangir_investing_a_courtier_with_a_robe_of_honour_watched_by_Sir_Thomas_Roe,_English_ambassador_to_the_court_of_Jahangir_at_Agra_from_1615-18,_and_others.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nJahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by Sir Thomas\nRoe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618,\nand others\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and\nPortuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major\nvictory over the Portuguese in the [Battle of Swally](/wiki/Battle_of_Swally\n\"Battle of Swally\") in 1612, at [Suvali](/wiki/Suvali \"Suvali\") in\n[Surat](/wiki/Surat \"Surat\"). The company decided to explore the feasibility\nof gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction\nfrom both Britain and the [Mughal Empire](/wiki/Mughal_Empire \"Mughal\nEmpire\"), and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.[16]\n\nIn 1612, James I instructed Sir [Thomas Roe](/wiki/Thomas_Roe \"Thomas Roe\") to\nvisit the Mughal Emperor Nuruddin Salim [Jahangir](/wiki/Jahangir \"Jahangir\")\n(r. 1605–1627) to arrange for a commercial treaty that would give the company\nexclusive rights to reside and establish factories in Surat and other areas.\nIn return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities\nfrom the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir\nsent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:[16]\n\n> Upon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to\n> all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of\n> the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever\n> they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and\n> at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other\n> shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have\n> residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them\n> freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into\n> their country at their pleasure.

As historian [William\nDalrymple](/wiki/William_Dalrymple_\\(historian\\) \"William Dalrymple\n\\(historian\\)\") observes,\n\n> We still talk about the British conquering India, but that phrase disguises\n> a more sinister reality.

It eclipsed the Portuguese [Estado da\nÍndia](/wiki/Estado_da_%C3%8Dndia \"Estado da Índia\"), which had established\nbases in [Goa](/wiki/Goa \"Goa\"), [Chittagong](/wiki/Chittagong \"Chittagong\"),\nand [Bombay](/wiki/Bombay \"Bombay\"), which Portugal later ceded to England as\npart of the [dowry](/wiki/Dowry \"Dowry\") of [Catherine of\nBraganza](/wiki/Catherine_of_Braganza \"Catherine of Braganza\"). The East India\nCompany also launched a joint attack with the Dutch [United East India\nCompany](/wiki/United_East_India_Company \"United East India Company\") (VOC) on\nPortuguese and Spanish ships off the coast of China, which helped secure EIC\nports in China.[17] The company established [trading posts](/wiki/Trading_post\n\"Trading post\") in [Surat](/wiki/Surat \"Surat\") (1619), [Madras](/wiki/Chennai\n\"Chennai\") (1639), Bombay (1668), and [Calcutta](/wiki/Calcutta \"Calcutta\")\n(1690). By 1647, the company had 23 factories, each under the command of a\n[factor](/wiki/Factor_\\(agent\\) \"Factor \\(agent\\)\") or master merchant and\ngovernor, and 90 employees[_[clarification\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_] in India.\nThe major factories became the walled forts of [Fort\nWilliam](/wiki/Fort_William,_India \"Fort William, India\") in Bengal, [Fort St\nGeorge](/wiki/Fort_St_George \"Fort St George\") in Madras, and [Bombay\nCastle](/wiki/Bombay_Castle \"Bombay Castle\").\n\nIn 1634, the Mughal emperor extended his hospitality to the English traders to\nthe region of [Bengal](/wiki/Bengal \"Bengal\"), and in 1717 completely waived\ncustoms duties for their trade. The company's mainstay businesses were by then\ncotton, silk, [indigo dye](/wiki/Indigo_dye \"Indigo dye\"),\n[saltpetre](/wiki/Potassium_nitrate \"Potassium nitrate\"), and tea. The Dutch\nwere aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the\nspice trade in the [Straits of Malacca](/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca \"Straits of\nMalacca\") by ousting the Portuguese in 1640–41. With reduced Portuguese and\nSpanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense\ncompetition, resulting in the [Anglo-Dutch Wars](/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars\n\"Anglo-Dutch Wars\") of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nIn 1657, [Oliver Cromwell](/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell \"Oliver Cromwell\") renewed\nthe charter of 1609, and brought about minor changes in the holding of the\ncompany. The restoration of monarchy in England further enhanced the EIC's\nstatus.\n\nIn an act aimed at strengthening the power of the EIC, [King Charles\nII](/wiki/Charles_II_of_England \"Charles II of England\") granted the EIC (in a\nseries of five acts around 1670) the rights to autonomous territorial\nacquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops and form\nalliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal\njurisdiction over the acquired areas.[18]\n\n[William Hedges](/wiki/William_Hedges_\\(colonial_administrator\\) \"William\nHedges \\(colonial administrator\\)\") was sent in 1682 to [Shaista\nKhan](/wiki/Shaista_Khan \"Shaista Khan\"), the Mughal governor of Bengal, to\nobtain a [firman](/wiki/Firman \"Firman\"), an imperial directive that would\ngrant England regular trading privileges throughout the Mughal Empire.\nHowever, the company's governor in London, Sir [Josiah\nChild](/wiki/Josiah_Child \"Josiah Child\"), interfered with Hedges's mission,\ncausing Mughal Emperor [Aurangzeb](/wiki/Aurangzeb \"Aurangzeb\") to break off\nthe negotiations.\n\nIn 1689 a Mughal fleet commanded by [Sidi Yaqub](/wiki/Sidi_Yaqub \"Sidi\nYaqub\") attacked Bombay.

The emperor\nwithdrew his troops and the company subsequently re-established itself in\nBombay and set up a new base in Calcutta.[19]\n\nThe company eventually came to rule large areas of the Indian subcontinent\nwith its private armies, primarily composed of Indian [sepoys](/wiki/Sepoy\n\"Sepoy\"), exercising military power and assuming administrative functions.\n\n### Japan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=East_India_Company&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Japan\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Bodleian_Library_MS._Jap._b.2_Shuinjo.jpg/220px-\nBodleian_Library_MS._Jap._b.2_Shuinjo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bodleian_Library_MS._Jap._b.2_Shuinjo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bodleian_Library_MS._Jap._b.2_Shuinjo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDocument with the original [vermilion](/wiki/Vermilion \"Vermilion\") seal of\nTokugawa Ieyasu, granting trade privileges in Japan to the East India Company\nin 1613\n\nIn 1613, during the rule of [Tokugawa Hidetada](/wiki/Tokugawa_Hidetada\n\"Tokugawa Hidetada\") of the [Tokugawa shogunate](/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate\n\"Tokugawa shogunate\"), the British ship _[Clove](/wiki/Clove_\\(ship\\) \"Clove\n\\(ship\\)\")_ , under the command of Captain [John Saris](/wiki/John_Saris \"John\nSaris\"), was the first British ship to call on Japan.

The company developed a [lobby](/wiki/Lobbying \"Lobbying\") in\nthe English parliament. Under pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former\nassociates of the company (pejoratively termed _Interlopers_ by the company),\nwho wanted to establish private trading firms in India, a deregulating act was\npassed in 1694.[24]\n\nThis allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically\nprohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been\nin force for almost 100 years. By an act that was passed in 1698, a new\n\"parallel\" East India Company (officially titled the _English Company Trading\nto the East Indies_) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of £2 million.\nThe powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of\n£315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two companies\nwrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in India, for a\ndominant share of the trade.[24]\n\nIt quickly became evident that, in practice, the original company faced\nscarcely any measurable competition. The companies merged in 1708, by a\ntripartite indenture involving both companies and the state. Under this\narrangement, the merged company lent to the Treasury a sum of £3,200,000, in\nreturn for exclusive privileges for the next three years, after which the\nsituation was to be reviewed. The amalgamated company became the _United\nCompany of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies_.[24]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Portrait_of_East_India_Company_official.jpg/200px-\nPortrait_of_East_India_Company_official.jpg)](/wiki/File:Portrait_of_East_India_Company_official.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Portrait_of_East_India_Company_official.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Company painting](/wiki/Company_painting \"Company painting\") depicting an\nofficial of the East India Company, c. 1760\n\nIn the following decades there was a constant battle between the company lobby\nand the Parliament. The company sought a permanent establishment, while the\nParliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the\nopportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the\nstatus of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British\nimports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which\nreasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until\n1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes\nbetween them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing\nthe monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend\nthe deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until\n1783, in return for a further loan of £1 million. Between 1756 and 1763, the\n[Seven Years' War](/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War \"Seven Years' War\") diverted the\nstate's attention towards consolidation and [defence of its territorial\npossessions](/wiki/French_and_Indian_War \"French and Indian War\") in Europe\nand its [colonies in North America](/wiki/English_colonization_of_the_Americas\n\"English colonization of the Americas\").[25]\n\nThe war took place on Indian soil, between the company troops and the French\nforces. In 1757, the [Law Officers of the\nCrown](/wiki/Law_Officers_of_the_Crown \"Law Officers of the Crown\") delivered\nthe [Pratt-Yorke opinion](/wiki/Pratt-Yorke_opinion \"Pratt-Yorke opinion\")\ndistinguishing overseas territories acquired by [right of\nconquest](/wiki/Right_of_conquest \"Right of conquest\") from those acquired by\nprivate [treaty](/wiki/Treaty \"Treaty\"). The opinion asserted that, while the\nCrown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the\nformer was vested in the Crown.[25]\n\nWith the advent of the [Industrial Revolution](/wiki/Industrial_Revolution\n\"Industrial Revolution\"), Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand\nfor Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the\neconomy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and\nefficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain\nexperienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity,\ndemand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Again in 1673, Banks successfully negotiated another\ncontract for 700 tons of saltpetre at £37,000 between the king and the\ncompany. So urgent was the need to supply the armed forces in the United\nKingdom, America and elsewhere that the authorities sometimes turned a blind\neye on the untaxed sales.

The highest rank\nto which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Rissaldar-Major\nin cavalry units), effectively a senior [subaltern](/wiki/Subaltern\n\"Subaltern\") equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was\nstrictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned\nranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They\nreceived no training in administration or leadership to make them independent\nof their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and\nearly nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize\nthe colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of\n[Réunion](/wiki/R%C3%A9union \"Réunion\") and [Mauritius](/wiki/Mauritius\n\"Mauritius\").\n\nThere was a systemic disrespect in the company for the spreading of\n[Protestantism](/wiki/Protestantism \"Protestantism\") although it fostered\nrespect for [Hindu](/wiki/Hindu \"Hindu\") and [Muslim](/wiki/Muslim \"Muslim\"),\n[castes](/wiki/Caste \"Caste\") and ethnic groups.

The monopoly system established in 1799\ncontinued with minimal changes until 1947.[37] As the [opium\ntrade](/wiki/Opium_trade \"Opium trade\") was illegal in China, Company ships\ncould not carry opium to China. So the opium produced in Bengal was sold in\nCalcutta on condition that it be sent to China.[38]\n\nDespite the Chinese ban on opium imports, reaffirmed in 1799 by the [Jiaqing\nEmperor](/wiki/Jiaqing_Emperor \"Jiaqing Emperor\"), the drug was smuggled into\nChina from Bengal by traffickers and agency houses such as [Jardine, Matheson\n& Co](/wiki/Jardine_Matheson_Holdings \"Jardine Matheson Holdings\") and [Dent &\nCo.](/wiki/Dent_%26_Co. \"Dent & Co.\") in amounts averaging 900 tons a year.\nThe proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [Lintin\nIsland](/wiki/Lintin_Island \"Lintin Island\") were paid into the company's\nfactory at [Canton](/wiki/Guangzhou \"Guangzhou\") and by 1825, most of the\nmoney needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits\nof Malacca called the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements \"Straits\nSettlements\") in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local\npiracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian\ncivilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400\ntons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent\na Special Imperial Commissioner, [Lin Zexu](/wiki/Lin_Zexu \"Lin Zexu\"), to\ncurb smuggling. This resulted in the [First Opium War](/wiki/First_Opium_War\n\"First Opium War\") (1839–42). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to\nBritain under the [Treaty of Nanking](/wiki/Treaty_of_Nanking \"Treaty of\nNanking\") and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and\nother nations.[37] The Jardines and [Apcar and\nCompany](/wiki/Apcar_and_Company \"Apcar and Company\") dominated the trade,\nalthough [P&O](/wiki/Peninsular_and_Oriental_Steam_Navigation_Company\n\"Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company\") also tried to take a\nshare.[39] A [Second Opium War](/wiki/Second_Opium_War \"Second Opium War\")\nfought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led\nto the [Treaty of Tientsin](/wiki/Treaty_of_Tientsin \"Treaty of Tientsin\"),\nwhich legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic\nChinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey\nand Persia.

In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India](/wiki/India_Board \"India Board\"), usually referred to as the Board of Control.

The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian\ncalls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories.\n[Edmund Burke](/wiki/Edmund_Burke \"Edmund Burke\"), a former East India Company\nshareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a\nnew Regulating Bill in 1783.
