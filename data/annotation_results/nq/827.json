The game is part\nof the larger [Utah–BYU rivalry](/wiki/Utah%E2%80%93BYU_rivalry \"Utah–BYU\nrivalry\"). In this rivalry context, the term \"Holy War\" refers to the fact\nthat BYU is owned and administered by [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\nday Saints](/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints \"The Church\nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\") (LDS) and the University of Utah is a\n[public university](/wiki/Public_university \"Public university\") owned and\nadministered by the State of [Utah](/wiki/Utah \"Utah\"). Although many Utah\nfans are LDS members, the term \"Holy War\" also refers to the stark cultural\ndifferences of the respective fan bases. The proximity of the two schools, the\nathletic successes of the two teams, and the longevity of the series also\ncontribute to the rivalry.[1]\n\nBoth teams played in the same conference from 1922 to 2010 and the Holy War\ngame often decided the conference title. Despite Utah moving to the [Pac-12\nConference](/wiki/Pac-12_Conference \"Pac-12 Conference\") in 2011 and BYU\nbecoming an [independent](/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_FBS_independent_schools \"NCAA\nDivision I FBS independent schools\") that same year, the two universities\nagreed to play between 2011 and 2013 prior to a brief interruption in the\nseries for 2014 and 2015 – the first since 1943 to 1945, when BYU did not\nfield a team due to World War II. Games between 2016 and 2020 were also\nsubsequently booked, which might precede another break in the series.\n\nThe two-year hiatus of 2014–2015 was unexpectedly cut short when the [2015 Las\nVegas Bowl](/wiki/2015_Las_Vegas_Bowl \"2015 Las Vegas Bowl\") pitted BYU\nagainst Utah, creating the \"Holy War in Sin City\" in the postseason.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Rivalry components\n    * 1.1 Religion\n    * 1.2 Longevity\n    * 1.3 Proximity\n    * 1.4 Successful teams\n    * 1.5 Fan base comparisons\n  * 2 Series history\n    * 2.1 The Brigham Young Academy years\n    * 2.2 Utah's early dominance\n    * 2.3 The LaVell Edwards era\n      * 2.3.1 1977–1981: Edwards versus Howard\n        * 2.3.1.1 Wayne Howard's Crusade\n        * 2.3.1.2 Jim McMahon says, \"Scoreboard.\"\n      * 2.3.2 1982–1984: Edwards versus Stobart\n        * 2.3.2.1 National Champions\n      * 2.3.3 1985–1989: Edwards versus Fassel\n        * 2.3.3.1 The Rice Bowl\n        * 2.3.3.2 Revenge\n    * 2.4 The modern rivalry\n      * 2.4.1 1990–2000: Edwards versus McBride\n        * 2.4.1.1 The Kaneshiro Doink\n        * 2.4.1.2 Utah cheerleader pummels an aggressive fan\n        * 2.4.1.3 Edwards' last game\n      * 2.4.2 2001 and 2002: Crowton versus McBride\n      * 2.4.3 2003 and 2004: Crowton versus Meyer\n        * 2.4.3.1 Scoring streak ends\n        * 2.4.3.2 BCS busters\n      * 2.4.4 2005–2015: Mendenhall versus Whittingham\n        * 2.4.4.1 First overtime game\n        * 2.4.4.2 Beck to Harline\n        * 2.4.4.3 Magic happens.\n        * 2.4.4.4 BCS busting... again\n        * 2.4.4.5 Second overtime game\n        * 2.4.4.6 Burton's block\n        * 2.4.4.7 Shock and awe\n        * 2.4.4.8 Fandemonium\n        * 2.4.4.9 Twenty-Thirteen in 2013\n        * 2.4.4.10 2015 Las Vegas Bowl\n      * 2.4.5 2016–present: Whittingham versus Sitake\n        * 2.4.5.1 2016: Hindsight is 20–20\n        * 2.4.5.2 2017\n  * 3 Future games\n  * 4 Game results\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n\n## Rivalry\ncomponents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Rivalry components\")]\n\nThere are a number of components that make the Holy War particularly fierce.\nThe University of Utah and Brigham Young University are the two biggest\ncolleges in the state of Utah. There is a stark contrast between the campuses\nand student bodies, as one is a religious institution while the other is a\npublic university. As the name of the rivalry implies, religion is a large\ncomponent to the rivalry. Brigham Young University is owned by the LDS church,\nand thus imposes religious restrictions upon its students. Although both are\ndry campuses, variation between the religious student body at BYU and more\nlax, traditional university student body of Utah creates further animosity\nbetween the two schools. The long length of rivalry is also a major\nelement.[1]\n\n###\nReligion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Religion\")]\n\nThere's too much religion involved. I did not like that. I really didn't.\n\n— Former Utah head coach [Wayne\nHoward](/wiki/Wayne_Howard_\\(American_football\\) \"Wayne Howard \\(American\nfootball\\)\")[2]\n\nThe [University of Utah](/wiki/University_of_Utah \"University of Utah\") is the\nflagship university of the [state of Utah](/wiki/Utah \"Utah\"), while [Brigham\nYoung University](/wiki/Brigham_Young_University \"Brigham Young University\")\nis the flagship university of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints](/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints \"The Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\") (LDS Church). The matchup has been\ndescribed as taking on religious, or \"church vs. state\" undertones.[3][1] Utah\nfans may drink alcohol or swear around BYU fans, both of which are known to be\nforbidden by the [Church Educational System Honor\nCode](/wiki/Church_Educational_System_Honor_Code \"Church Educational System\nHonor Code\"), which all BYU students and faculty are required to maintain. In\n2013, two Utah football players videotaped a mock baptism in their practice\nfacility tub that some BYU fans believed was mocking the LDS ordinance of\nbaptism.[4]\n\n###\nLongevity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Longevity\")]\n\nThe two schools disagree on when the first game was played. Utah claims that\nthe first game was played in 1896 against [Brigham Young\nAcademy](/wiki/Brigham_Young_University#History \"Brigham Young University\").\nBYU's athletic website shows their schedule dating back to 1922, but no\nearlier.[5] Utah claims a lead of 58–34–4, while BYU claims Utah leads\n55–31–4. BYU does not count the six games between Utah and Brigham Young\nAcademy in its records.\n\nUtah has a large lead in the overall series and has dominated the rivalry both\nprior to 1972 (41–8–4) and after 1992 (18–7). In stark contrast, from 1972 to\n1992 BYU dominated the series with a record of 19–2 versus Utah. Since 1983,\nwhen BYU won 55–7, the largest point spread is 44 points, which occurred in\n2011 when Utah won 54–10 in Provo.\n\nUtah's average margin of victory in the games it has won since 2000 is 14\npoints, while BYU's is four points. The Cougars haven't had a dominating\nvictory over Utah since 1996 (37–17), while the Utes have notched three\nblowout wins (2004, 2008, 2011) in the series' most recent 10 games.[6]\n\n###\nProximity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Proximity\")]\n\nWhen Brigham Young came into the valley, he pointed to where the University of\nUtah would be and said, \"This is the place.\" Provo was just an afterthought.\n\n— Former Utah Head Coach [Ron McBride](/wiki/Ron_McBride \"Ron McBride\")[7]\n\nBYU, which is in [Provo, Utah](/wiki/Provo,_Utah \"Provo, Utah\"), and the\nUniversity of Utah, which is in [Salt Lake City](/wiki/Salt_Lake_City \"Salt\nLake City\"), are about 50 miles (80 km) apart and approximately an hour's\ndrive away on [Interstate 15](/wiki/Interstate_15 \"Interstate 15\").[8]\nConsequently, the two teams compete for recruits[9] and fan support.[10] It is\nnot uncommon for friends, neighbors, and even family members to have opposite\nallegiances.[1]\n\n### Successful\nteams[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Successful teams\")]\n\nWhile the two teams have not necessarily been strong at the same time, the two\nteams had the most conference championships in the [Mountain West\nConference](/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference \"Mountain West Conference\") (MW)\nbefore both [left the MW in\n2011](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9313_Mountain_West_Conference_realignment \"2010–13\nMountain West Conference realignment\"). Each team has had four conference\nchampionships since the creation of the MW in 1999.[11] Including\nchampionships of other conferences, Utah has 24 conference championships in\nits history,[12] while BYU has 23.[13] Both of these numbers are well ahead of\nthe current MW member with the most conference championships, [Colorado\nState](/wiki/Colorado_State_Rams_football \"Colorado State Rams football\"), who\nhas 15.[14] Other than the 2011 meeting, the recent games in the Holy War have\ntended to be close, with the final score of fifteen of the last nineteen games\nbeing within a [touchdown](/wiki/Touchdown \"Touchdown\") (seven points,\nincluding a successful conversion kick) or less.[6]\n\nBYU lays claim to a consensus [national\nchampionship](/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS\n\"College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS\") for going\nundefeated in [1984](/wiki/1984_BYU_Cougars_football_team \"1984 BYU Cougars\nfootball team\") and beating\n[Michigan](/wiki/1984_Michigan_Wolverines_football_team \"1984 Michigan\nWolverines football team\") in the [1984 Holiday Bowl](/wiki/1984_Holiday_Bowl\n\"1984 Holiday Bowl\"). During the era of the now-defunct [Bowl Championship\nSeries](/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series \"Bowl Championship Series\")\n(1998–2013), Utah played in two BCS bowls: the [2005 Fiesta\nBowl](/wiki/2005_Fiesta_Bowl \"2005 Fiesta Bowl\") (a 35–7 victory over\n[Pitt](/wiki/2004_Pittsburgh_Panthers_football_team \"2004 Pittsburgh Panthers\nfootball team\")) and the [2009 Sugar Bowl](/wiki/2009_Sugar_Bowl \"2009 Sugar\nBowl\") (a 31–17 victory over\n[Alabama](/wiki/2008_Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football_team \"2008 Alabama Crimson\nTide football team\")). For these BCS bowl victories, Utah finished ranked in\nthe [AP Poll](/wiki/AP_Poll \"AP Poll\") #4 and #2, respectively. Many sports\nmedia members and observers, including ESPN's Rick Reilly, argued that Utah\n(the nation's lone undefeated FBS team) should have been awarded the AP\nNational Championship and should have been selected to play\n[Florida](/wiki/2004_Florida_Gators_football_team \"2004 Florida Gators\nfootball team\") in the BCS title game.\n\n### Fan base\ncomparisons[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Fan base comparisons\")]\n\nIn 2011 the New York Times polled fans of all current FBS schools to rank them\naccording to the size of their respective fan bases. BYU was ranked #43\nnationally with 709,864 people self-identifying as BYU fans while Utah was\nranked #67 with 351,939 people self-identifying as fans.[15]\n\nIn 2016 Utah saw an average of 46,506 fans attend home games and 41,303 fans\non the road (including a bowl game). Rice-Eccles Stadium holds a maximum of\n45,807 meaning that the stadium was typically over capacity and utilized\nstanding-room-only areas. BYU averaged 58,569 fans at home and 44,296 at away\ngames.

The\ntwo schools split the series 3–3.[17] The first meeting was an unusual April\ncontest that Utah won 12–4.\n\nBYA stopped playing football in 1900, following a player death,[18] and did\nnot start again until 1922, after it had become Brigham Young University\n(BYU). BYU does not recognize these first six meetings as it only recognizes\nfootball games played from 1922 onward.[19]\n\n### Utah's early\ndominance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Utah's early dominance\")]\n\nAfter twenty-three years of not having a team, BYU resumed play for the 1922\nseason.[1] Utah began its early dominance over BYU with a 49–0 victory on\nOctober 14, 1922. BYU would not get another win in the series until 1942, when\nthe Cougars shocked the Utes 12–7 at Utah. The rivalry then took a hiatus from\n1943 to 1945 because BYU did not field a team due to World War II. When the\nrivalry continued in 1946, the Utes continued their domination over the\nCougars, winning or tying the next twelve contests. Save for a three-year BYU\nwinning streak from 1965–1967, the rivalry continued this trend through the\n1971 season, at which point Utah had amassed a 41–8–4 (.811) record against\nBYU.\n\n### The LaVell Edwards\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: The LaVell Edwards era\")]\n\nIn 1972, the rivalry shifted in favor of BYU. The Cougars had hired [LaVell\nEdwards](/wiki/LaVell_Edwards \"LaVell Edwards\") and in his first season, BYU\nbeat Utah 16–7 for BYU's first victory over Utah in four years. The win\nsignaled the beginning of BYU's dominance against Utah. From 1972 to 1992, BYU\nwent 19–2 (.905) against Utah.\n\nDuring those years, Utah went through a series of coaches that all ended with\nlosing records against LaVell Edwards and BYU. [Bill Meek](/wiki/Bill_Meek\n\"Bill Meek\")'s Utes went 0–2 against Edwards during Meek's last two years\n(1972–1973). [Tom Lovat](/wiki/Tom_Lovat \"Tom Lovat\") (1974–1976) was 0–3.\n[Wayne Howard](/wiki/Wayne_Howard_\\(American_football\\) \"Wayne Howard\n\\(American football\\)\") (1977–1981) was 1–4. [Chuck\nStobart](/wiki/Chuck_Stobart \"Chuck Stobart\") (1982–1984) was 0–3. [Jim\nFassel](/wiki/Jim_Fassel \"Jim Fassel\") was 1–4. Finally, Utah found some\nsuccess when it hired [Ron McBride](/wiki/Ron_McBride \"Ron McBride\") in 1990.\nMcBride would finish with a 5–6 record against LaVell Edwards, but he started\nwith three consecutive losses to Edwards.[6]\n\n#### 1977–1981: Edwards versus\nHoward[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: 1977–1981: Edwards versus Howard\")]\n\n##### Wayne Howard's\nCrusade[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Wayne Howard's Crusade\")]\n\nThe hatred between BYU and Utah is nothing compared to what it will be.

Wilson succeeded in setting the record (subsequently broken) and\nfinished the game with 571 passing yards. The incident infuriated Utah head\ncoach [Wayne Howard](/wiki/Wayne_Howard_\\(American_football\\) \"Wayne Howard\n\\(American football\\)\"). After the game, he said, \"This today will be\ninspiring. The hatred between BYU and Utah is nothing compared to what it will\nbe. It will be a crusade to beat BYU from now on.

On what was thought to be the final play of the\ngame, Nelson's deflected pass fell incomplete as time seemingly expired and\nthe Utah fans rushed the field.

BYU's defense was able to come up with a stop and they took over\nthe ball on their own 8-yard line with 1:38 remaining and one timeout. Utah's\ndefense stood strong and BYU was unable to move the ball. Utah went on to beat\nBYU 19–13, marking the 7th straight win for the Utes over the Cougars.[45][46]\n\n## Future\ngames[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=42\n\"Edit section: Future games\")]\n\nBYU and Utah have agreed to continue the series between 2017 and 2022, but no\ngames have been scheduled beyond that. The 2018 contest is set for November\n24—both teams' final game of the year—despite the game being a non-conference\nmatchup. Utah typically plays Colorado in the final week, but a scheduling\nanomaly in the Pac-12 facilitated the rivalry game being played the final week\ninstead of September. In 2019 and 2020, the game will be the first of each\nseason.[47]\n\nThe interruption of the series in 2014 and 2015 sparked discontent in both fan\nbases – particularly among BYU fans, some of whom felt that the break was\nnothing more than a boastful dig at the Cougars' program. Utah AD Chris Hill\nacknowledged the topic in August 2015 and said a large number of Utah fans had\nexpressed to him a desire to take a break from the rivalry.\n\n\"The message I have received loud and clear from Utah season ticket holders is\nthat they support our decision to take a two-year hiatus from the BYU\nrivalry\", Hill said.[48]\n\nAnother break in the series may follow in the 2020s, as Utah has a scheduled\nseries with the [Baylor Bears](/wiki/Baylor_Bears_football \"Baylor Bears\nfootball\") in 2023 and 2024, filling the \"tier 1 team\" slot on the schedule,\nas Michigan did during the hiatus of 2014–2015.\n\n## Game\nresults[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Holy_War_\\(Utah_vs._BYU\\)&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: Game results\")]\n\nBYU victories | Utah victories |
