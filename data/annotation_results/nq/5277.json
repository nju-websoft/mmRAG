It has become an iconic song of its\ntype and was immensely popular with [United States Armed\nForces](/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces \"United States Armed Forces\") GIs\nduring the [Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\").\n\nIn 2004 it was ranked number 233 on _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone\n\"Rolling Stone\")_ 's [The 500 Greatest Songs of All\nTime](/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time \"Rolling Stone's\n500 Greatest Songs of All Time\") list; it is also in [The Rock and Roll Hall\nof Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and\nRoll](/wiki/The_Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame%27s_500_Songs_that_Shaped_Rock_and_Roll\n\"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\") list.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 The two versions\n  * 2 Impact\n  * 3 In popular culture\n  * 4 The Angels version\n  * 5 Track listing\n  * 6 Personnel\n  * 7 Other versions\n  * 8 Charts\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Gotta_Get_out_of_This_Place&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nBarry Mann and Cynthia Weil were husband and wife (and future [Hall of\nFame](/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame \"Songwriters Hall of Fame\"))\n[songwriters](/wiki/Songwriter \"Songwriter\") associated with the 1960s [Brill\nBuilding](/wiki/Brill_Building \"Brill Building\") scene in [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\").[2]\n\nMann and Weil wrote and recorded \"We Gotta Get out of This Place\" as a\n[demo](/wiki/Demo_recording \"Demo recording\"), with Mann singing and playing\n[piano](/wiki/Piano \"Piano\"). It was intended for [The Righteous\nBrothers](/wiki/The_Righteous_Brothers \"The Righteous Brothers\"), for whom\nthey had written the number one hit \"[You've Lost That Lovin'\nFeelin'](/wiki/You%27ve_Lost_That_Lovin%27_Feelin%27 \"You've Lost That Lovin'\nFeelin'\")\"[3] but then Mann gained a recording contract for himself, and his\nlabel [Red Bird Records](/wiki/Red_Bird_Records \"Red Bird Records\") wanted him\nto release it instead. Meanwhile, record executive [Allen\nKlein](/wiki/Allen_Klein \"Allen Klein\") had heard it and gave the demo to\n[Mickie Most](/wiki/Mickie_Most \"Mickie Most\"), The Animals'\n[producer](/wiki/Record_producer \"Record producer\"). Most already had a call\nout to Brill Building songwriters for material for the group's next recording\nsession (The Animals hits \"[It's My\nLife](/wiki/It%27s_My_Life_\\(The_Animals_song\\) \"It's My Life \\(The Animals\nsong\\)\")\" and \"[Don't Bring Me\nDown](/wiki/Don%27t_Bring_Me_Down_\\(The_Animals_song\\) \"Don't Bring Me Down\n\\(The Animals song\\)\")\" came from the same call[4]), and The Animals recorded\nit before Mann could.[3]\n\nIn The Animals' rendition, the lyrics were slightly reordered and reworded\nfrom the demo and opened with a locational allusion – although different from\nthat in the songwriters' minds – that was often taken as fitting the group's\n[industrial](/wiki/Industrial_revolution \"Industrial revolution\"), [working\nclass](/wiki/Working_class \"Working class\") [Newcastle-upon-\nTyne](/wiki/Newcastle-upon-Tyne \"Newcastle-upon-Tyne\") origins:[5][6][7]\n\n> In this dirty old part of the city  \n>  Where the sun refused to shine  \n>  People tell me, there ain't no use in tryin'\n\nNext came a verse about the singer's father in his deathbed after a lifetime\nof working his life away, followed by a call-and-response buildup, leading to\nthe start of the chorus:\n\n> We gotta get out of this place!  \n>  If it's the last thing we ever do…\n\nThe arrangement featured a distinctive bass lead by group member [Chas\nChandler](/wiki/Chas_Chandler \"Chas Chandler\").[8] This was the first single\nnot to be recorded by the original line-up, following as it did the departure\nof keyboard player [Alan Price](/wiki/Alan_Price \"Alan Price\") and his\nreplacement by [Dave Rowberry](/wiki/Dave_Rowberry \"Dave Rowberry\"). It\nfeatured one of singer [Eric Burdon](/wiki/Eric_Burdon \"Eric Burdon\")'s\ntypically raw, fierce vocals.[9][10] _Rolling Stone_ described the overall\neffect as a \"harsh white-blues treatment from The Animals. As [Burdon] put it,\n'Whatever suited our attitude, we just bent to our own shape.'\"[11]\n\nThe song reached number 2 on the [UK pop singles chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart\n\"UK Singles Chart\") on August 14, 1965 (held out of the top slot by [The\nBeatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\")' \"[Help!](/wiki/Help!_\\(song\\)\n\"Help! \\(song\\)\")\").[12] The following month, it reached number 13 on the\n[U.S. pop singles chart](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\"), its\nhighest placement there.[13] In Canada, the song also reached number 2, on\nSeptember 20, 1965.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### The two\nversions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Gotta_Get_out_of_This_Place&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: The two versions\")]\n\nThe UK and US single releases were different versions from the same recording\nsessions. The take that [EMI](/wiki/EMI \"EMI\"), The Animals' parent record\ncompany, sent to [MGM Records](/wiki/MGM_Records \"MGM Records\"), the group's\nAmerican label, was mistakenly one that had not been selected for release\nelsewhere. The two versions are most easily differentiated by the lyric at the\nbeginning of the second verse: in the US version the lyric is, \"See my daddy\nin bed a-dyin'\", while the UK version uses, \"Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'\"\n(as a result of an error by the music labels, certain online retailers sell\nthe UK version but incorrectly identify it as the US version).\n\nIn the US the song (in its \"mistaken\" take) was included on the album _[Animal\nTracks](/wiki/Animal_Tracks_\\(U.S._album\\) \"Animal Tracks \\(U.S. album\\)\")_ ,\nreleased in the fall 1965, and again on the popular compilation _[The Best of\nThe Animals](/wiki/The_Best_of_The_Animals_\\(1966_album\\) \"The Best of The\nAnimals \\(1966 album\\)\")_ released in 1966 and re-released with an expanded\ntrack list on the [ABKCO](/wiki/ABKCO \"ABKCO\") label in 1973. The song was not\non any British Animals album during the group's lifetime.\n\nOnce Animals reissues began occurring during the [compact\ndisc](/wiki/Compact_disc \"Compact disc\") era, Allen Klein, by now owner of\n[ABKCO](/wiki/ABKCO \"ABKCO\") and the rights to this material, dictated that\nthe \"correct\" British version be used on all reissues and compilations\neverywhere. Thus, as US radio stations converted from vinyl records to CDs,\ngradually only the British version became heard. Some collectors and fans in\nthe US wrote letters of complaint to _[Goldmine](/wiki/Goldmine_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Goldmine \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine, saying they believed the US version\nfeatured an angrier and more powerful vocal from Burdon, and in any case\nwanted to hear the song in the form they had grown up with. The 2004\nremastered [SACD](/wiki/Super_Audio_CD \"Super Audio CD\") _Retrospective_\ncompilation from ABKCO included the US version.\n\n##\nImpact[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Gotta_Get_out_of_This_Place&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Impact\")]\n\nAt the time, the title and simple emotional appeal of \"We Gotta Get out of\nThis Place\" lent itself to some obvious self-identifications—for instance, it\nwas a very popular number to be played at high school [senior\nproms](/wiki/Senior_prom \"Senior prom\") and graduation parties. In music\nwriter [Dave Marsh](/wiki/Dave_Marsh \"Dave Marsh\")'s view, it was one of a\nwave of songs in 1965, by artists such as [The Beatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The\nBeatles\"), [The Rolling Stones](/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones \"The Rolling\nStones\"), and [Bob Dylan](/wiki/Bob_Dylan \"Bob Dylan\"), that ushered in a new\nrole for rock music as a vehicle for common perception and as a force for\nsocial consciousness.[14] Writer Craig Werner sees the song as reflecting the\ndesire of people to take a hard look at their own lives and the community they\ncome from.[10] Burdon later said, \"The song became an anthem for different\npeople – everybody at some time wants to get out of the situation they're\nin.\"[5]\n\nThe song was very popular with [United States Armed\nForces](/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces \"United States Armed Forces\") members\nstationed in [South Vietnam](/wiki/South_Vietnam \"South Vietnam\") during the\n[Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\").[7] It was frequently requested\nof, and played by, [American Forces Vietnam\nNetwork](/wiki/American_Forces_Vietnam_Network \"American Forces Vietnam\nNetwork\") [disc jockeys](/wiki/Disc_jockey \"Disc jockey\").[15] During 2006 two\n[University of\nWisconsin–Madison](/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison \"University\nof Wisconsin–Madison\") employees, one a Vietnam veteran, began an in-depth\nsurvey of hundreds of Vietnam veterans, and found that \"We Gotta Get out of\nThis Place\" had resonated the strongest among all the music popular then: \"We\nhad absolute unanimity is this song being the touchstone. This was the Vietnam\nanthem. Every bad band that ever played in an armed forces club had to play\nthis song.\"[16] Just such a band played the song in an episode (\"USO Down\", by\nVietnam veteran [Jim Beaver](/wiki/Jim_Beaver \"Jim Beaver\")) of the American\ntelevision series about the war, _[Tour of\nDuty](/wiki/Tour_of_Duty_\\(TV_series\\) \"Tour of Duty \\(TV series\\)\")_ , and\nthe song is reprised in the episode's final scene.\n\n\"We Gotta Get out of This Place\" was also used in [Dennis\nPotter](/wiki/Dennis_Potter \"Dennis Potter\")'s 1965 television play _[Stand\nUp, Nigel Barton](/wiki/Stand_Up,_Nigel_Barton \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton\")_ and\nthe [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\")'s 1996 [Newcastle](/wiki/Newcastle-upon-Tyne\n\"Newcastle-upon-Tyne\")-set _[Our Friends in the\nNorth](/wiki/Our_Friends_in_the_North \"Our Friends in the North\")_ , which\npartially took place in the 1960s. In America it was used as the title credits\nsong in some episodes of the Vietnam War-set television series _[China\nBeach](/wiki/China_Beach \"China Beach\")_. It was then applied to the Bin Laden\nfamily, having to leave the United States in the aftermath of the [September\n11th terrorist attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks \"September 11 attacks\"), in\n[Michael Moore](/wiki/Michael_Moore \"Michael Moore\")'s 2004 _[Fahrenheit\n9/11](/wiki/Fahrenheit_9/11 \"Fahrenheit 9/11\")_. It also was featured in the\nsoundtrack to the 1987 movie _[Hamburger Hill](/wiki/Hamburger_Hill \"Hamburger\nHill\")_. It was used in a third-season episode of the 2000s television series\n_[Heroes](/wiki/Heroes_TV_series \"Heroes TV series\")_. It was used as the\ntheme song for 2002 BBC comedy _[TLC](/wiki/TLC_\\(TV_series\\) \"TLC \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ and the 2013 BBC series _[Privates](/wiki/Privates_\\(TV_series\\)\n\"Privates \\(TV series\\)\")_. The song was also featured humorously in the\n_[Kong: Skull Island](/wiki/Kong:_Skull_Island \"Kong: Skull Island\")_\ntrailer[17]\n\nIn a 2012 keynote speech to an audience at the [South by\nSouthwest](/wiki/South_by_Southwest \"South by Southwest\") music festival,\n[Bruce Springsteen](/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen \"Bruce Springsteen\") performed an\nabbreviated version of The Animals' version on acoustic guitar and then said,\n\"That's every song I've ever written. That's all of them. I'm not kidding,\neither. That’s '[Born to Run](/wiki/Born_to_Run_\\(song\\) \"Born to Run\n\\(song\\)\")', '[Born in the U.S.A.](/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A._\\(song\\) \"Born in\nthe U.S.A. \\(song\\)\")'\"[18]\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Gotta_Get_out_of_This_Place&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: In popular culture\")]\n\nThe song's title and theme have become a common cultural phrase over the\nyears.\n\nIt formed the basis for the title of academician [Lawrence\nGrossberg](/wiki/Lawrence_Grossberg \"Lawrence Grossberg\")'s _[We Gotta Get out\nof This Place: Popular Conservatism and Postmodern Culture\n(1992)](/wiki/We_Gotta_Get_out_of_This_Place:_Popular_Conservatism_and_Postmodern_Culture_\\(1992\\)\n\"We Gotta Get out of This Place: Popular Conservatism and Postmodern Culture\n\\(1992\\)\")_ , detailing the conflict between [American\nconservatism](/wiki/American_conservatism \"American conservatism\") and rock\nculture. Similarly, it formed the title basis for Gerri Hirshey's 2002\naccount, _We Gotta Get out of This Place: The True, Tough Story of Women in\nRock_.\n\nIt has also been used as the title of editorials by _[American Journalism\nReview](/wiki/American_Journalism_Review \"American Journalism Review\")_[19]\nand other publications. The title was even used to name an art exhibit,\ncurated by Stefan Kalmar at the Cubitt Gallery in [London](/wiki/London\n\"London\") in 1997.\n\n## The Angels\nversion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=We_Gotta_Get_out_of_This_Place&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: The Angels version\")]\n\nWe Gotta Get Out of This Place is the twenty eighth single by Australian [Hard\nrock](/wiki/Hard_rock \"Hard rock\") band [The\nAngels](/wiki/The_Angels_\\(Australian_band\\) \"The Angels \\(Australian\nband\\)\"), released in 1986.[20][21] It is the third single to be released from\nThe Angels eighth studio album [Howling](/wiki/Howling_\\(The_Angels_album\\)\n\"Howling \\(The Angels album\\)\").
