I looked at several African-American\n> magazines, and used them as the basis of inspiration for bringing The Falcon\n> to life.[5]\n\nHe was introduced as an unnamed former resident of [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\")'s [Harlem](/wiki/Harlem \"Harlem\")\nneighborhood, who had adopted a wild falcon he trained and named Redwing. (His\nown name, **Sam Wilson** , was not given until page five of the following\nissue.) When a group of men on an island \"in the tropics\" wanted a hunting\nfalcon, Wilson answered the ad, only to discover that the self-dubbed \"Exiles\"\nwere former [Nazis](/wiki/Nazi \"Nazi\") in league with the\n[supervillain](/wiki/Supervillain \"Supervillain\") the [Red\nSkull](/wiki/Red_Skull \"Red Skull\"). He escaped, but remained on the island to\norganize the natives to confront the Exiles, who had turned them into\n[serfs](/wiki/Serf \"Serf\"). At the urging of Steve Rogers, whom he later\nlearned was Captain America, Wilson took on the costumed identity of the\n**Falcon** and underwent training with Rogers in order to better inspire the\nvillagers and lead the fight.[6]\n\nThrough most of the 1970s, the Falcon and Captain America were a team in New\nYork City, and the series was cover-billed _Captain America and the Falcon_\nfrom issues #134–192 and 194–222 (February 1971 – June 1978),[7] though still\ncopyrighted as _Captain America_. In issue #186 (June 1975), writer [Steve\nEnglehart](/wiki/Steve_Englehart \"Steve Englehart\")\n[retconned](/wiki/Retconned \"Retconned\") aspects of the Falcon's past.\nOriginally depicted as a former [social worker](/wiki/Social_worker \"Social\nworker\"), motivated by a desire to better the lives of inner-city youth, the\nFalcon was revealed as a mob-connected thug whose memories were altered by the\nreality-warping [Cosmic Cube](/wiki/Cosmic_Cube \"Cosmic Cube\").\n\nThe Falcon briefly joined the superhero team the\n[Defenders](/wiki/Defenders_\\(comics\\) \"Defenders \\(comics\\)\"), appearing in\nissues #62–64 (August–October 1978), and was a member of the\n[Avengers](/wiki/Avengers_\\(comics\\) \"Avengers \\(comics\\)\") from issues\n#183–194 (May 1979 – April 1980). During this time he also starred in a solo\nadventure in issue #49 of the try-out series _[Marvel\nPremiere](/wiki/Marvel_Premiere \"Marvel Premiere\")_ ; however, the story was\nnot a try-out for a Falcon series, but an intended fill-in issue of _Captain\nAmerica_ which was shuffled into _Marvel Premiere_ when the editors objected\nto having an issue of _Captain America_ with someone other than the title\ncharacter as the star.[8] He starred in his own four-issue miniseries in 1983,\nwritten by [Jim Owsley](/wiki/Jim_Owsley \"Jim Owsley\"). Its first issue was\nillustrated by [Paul Smith](/wiki/Paul_Smith_\\(comics\\) \"Paul Smith\n\\(comics\\)\") with the final three issues by [Mark Bright](/wiki/M._D._Bright\n\"M. D. Bright\"). The series revealed that the Falcon was a\n[mutant](/wiki/Mutant_\\(comics\\) \"Mutant \\(comics\\)\"), although this\ndevelopment was later retconned in the _Avengers 2001 Annual_.[9]\n\nAfter regularly appearing in _Captain America_ vol. 2 (November 1996 –\nNovember 1997), the Falcon rejoined the Avengers in _The Avengers_ vol. 3, #1\n(February 1998). This time, he remained with the team, becoming one of its\nmost prominent members by issue #57 (Oct. 2002). Concurrently, he was also a\nsupporting character in _Captain America_ vols. 3–4 (January 1998 – February\n2002 and June 2002 – December 2004). The Falcon next appeared in the short-\nlived _[Captain America and the Falcon](/wiki/Captain_America_and_the_Falcon\n\"Captain America and the Falcon\")_ series, in 2004 and 2005. After the events\nof the storyline \"[Avengers Disassembled](/wiki/Avengers_Disassembled\n\"Avengers Disassembled\")\", when the [Scarlet Witch](/wiki/Scarlet_Witch\n\"Scarlet Witch\") temporarily restored his criminal personality, the Falcon\nbecame a supporting character in _Captain America_ vol. 5 (January 2005 – July\n2009). The Falcon continued to play a significant role in the series after it\nreturned to its original numbering, beginning with _Captain America_ #600\n(Aug. 2009).\n\nFalcon was a member of the Avengers in the 2012 [Marvel\nNOW!](/wiki/Marvel_NOW! \"Marvel NOW!\") relaunch.[10]\n\nOn July 16, 2014 Marvel Comics announced that Sam Wilson would relinquish the\nmantle of Falcon and would become the new [Captain\nAmerica](/wiki/Captain_America \"Captain America\"), succeeding Steve Rogers in\nthe role.[11] An ongoing series starring Sam Wilson as Captain America\nlaunched in October 2015, as part of Marvel's post-_[Secret\nWars](/wiki/Secret_Wars_\\(2015_comic_book\\) \"Secret Wars \\(2015 comic\nbook\\)\")_ relaunch, written by Nick Spencer and Daniel Acuña.[12]\n\nWilson temporarily returns to the role of Captain America in the 2017\nminiseries _[Marvel's Generations](/wiki/Generations_\\(comics\\) \"Generations\n\\(comics\\)\")_.[13]\n\nWilson resumed the identity of Falcon in a series written by Rodney Barnes\nthat debuted in late 2017, the character's first solo series since\n1983.[14][15]\n\n## Fictional character\nbiography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Falcon_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Fictional character biography\")]\n\n### Early\nlife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Falcon_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Early life\")]\n\nSamuel Thomas Wilson was born in [Harlem](/wiki/Harlem \"Harlem\"), [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), to Paul Wilson, a prominent\nminister, and Darlene Wilson. Wilson has a happy childhood and finds he has a\nnatural affinity for birds. He takes up training pigeons, and has the largest\npigeon coop in Harlem.[16] In his teens, however, encounters with racism leave\nhim jaded.[17] When he is 16, Wilson refuses to join the church, believing his\ndeeply religious parents to be ignorant for their faith. To his surprise,\nrather than put up a fight, his parents provide him with books on different\nreligions and comparative theology. The next night, however, Sam's father is\nkilled trying to break up a neighborhood fight (originally Paul was said to\nhave been killed when Sam was 9 years old).[18] Two years later, his mother is\nshot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment. Consumed by grief\nand \"angry at the world\" Sam turns his back on his past as a respected\ncommunity volunteer. He moves to [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los\nAngeles\") and creates a new persona: \"Snap\" Wilson, a professional criminal\nand gang member.[19][20]\n\nWhile Snap is on his way to \"a big score in [Rio de\nJaneiro](/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro \"Rio de Janeiro\")\", his plane crashes on Exile\nIsland (years later, he would say \"I actually loved this place quite a bit.\nIt's where I met my two best friends,\" referring to Captain America and\nRedwing).[21] The once-peaceful island had been taken over by the\n[Exiles](/wiki/Exiles_\\(Red_Skull_allies\\) \"Exiles \\(Red Skull allies\\)\"), a\ngroup of would-be world conquerors who had collaborated with the\n[Nazi](/wiki/Nazi \"Nazi\") [supervillain](/wiki/Supervillain \"Supervillain\")\nthe [Red Skull](/wiki/Red_Skull \"Red Skull\") during [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"). They had been betrayed by the Red\nSkull and were forced to remain in hiding on the island, enslaving the\nnatives. Wilson finds and befriends [Redwing](/wiki/Redwing_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)\n\"Redwing \\(Marvel Comics\\)\"), a falcon with which he feels a remarkably strong\nbond.[22]\n\n### Becoming the\nFalcon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Falcon_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Becoming the Falcon\")]\n\nAs part of a plot against Captain America, the Red Skull uses the [Cosmic\nCube](/wiki/Cosmic_Cube \"Cosmic Cube\"), a creation that allows its user to\nalter reality, to mentally fuse Wilson with Redwing, creating a \"super-normal\nmental link\" that would, with time and concentration, give Wilson broad powers\nover all birds.[23][24] Next, the Skull uses the Cube to rewrite the past and\nerase the years Wilson had spent angrily living as Snap Wilson. In this new\nhistory, Wilson was an upright and cheerful [social\nworker](/wiki/Social_worker \"Social worker\") who is eventually lured to the\nExiles' island and organizes the natives to fight for their freedom. Steve\nRogers (Captain America) befriends him there and convinces Wilson to adopt a\npersona to inspire the natives in their rebellion. The two create the costumed\npersona the Falcon and train together extensively before attacking and\ndefeating the Exiles and the Red Skull.[16] The Falcon becomes Captain\nAmerica's regular partner in crime-fighting,[25] and briefly even takes on the\nCaptain America costume and identity when Rogers is believed to have been\nkilled.[26]\n\nLater, again as the Falcon, Wilson receives help from the [Black\nPanther](/wiki/Black_Panther_\\(comics\\) \"Black Panther \\(comics\\)\"), who\ncreates a harness for Wilson, allowing him to fly.[27] When Rogers briefly\nabandons his Captain America identity, others attempt to take up the mantle,\nincluding a young man named Roscoe whom the Falcon mentors. When the Red Skull\neventually kills Roscoe, Rogers again becomes Captain America.[28]\n\nSoon afterward, the Red Skull reveals the Falcon's true past as Snap Wilson,\nand unsuccessfully attempts to use the Cosmic Cube to make the Falcon kill\nCaptain America.[29] Now aware of his past but deciding to continue as a hero,\nthe Falcon is eventually named head of the Super Agents at the\n[espionage](/wiki/Espionage \"Espionage\") agency\n[S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D. \"S.H.I.E.L.D.\").[30]\n\nUS government superhero liaison [Henry Peter Gyrich](/wiki/Henry_Peter_Gyrich\n\"Henry Peter Gyrich\") then recruits Wilson, one of the few active black\nsuperheroes, to fill a mandated racial quota for the venerable team the\n[Avengers](/wiki/Avengers_\\(comics\\) \"Avengers \\(comics\\)\").[31] Resentful of\nbeing a \"token\", the Falcon quits at the first opportunity. He debuts a new\ncostume when he fights the supervillain\n[Taskmaster](/wiki/Taskmaster_\\(comics\\) \"Taskmaster \\(comics\\)\").[32]\n\n### 2000s[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Falcon_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 2000s\")]\n\nFalcon becomes a member of the new team of Avengers assembled to fight the\ninternational menace\n[Scorpio](/w/index.php?title=S.C.O.R.P.I.O_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"S.C.O.R.P.I.O \\(comics\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\") as a United Nations\npeacekeeping agency. By this point, Falcon had discovered that he could extend\nhis telepathic bond with Redwing, allowing him to control other birds and\n\"see\" through their eyes. He uses this ability to spy on Henry Gyrich (now the\nAvengers' liaison with the United Nations) and discovers that the United\nStates' Secretary of Defense, Dell Rusk, has been pressuring Gyrich to spy on\nthe Avengers and turn over their secrets. Although initially hostile to one\nanother, Falcon convinces Gyrich to help the Avengers spy on Rusk, feeding him\nfalse information while gathering evidence to expose him. They discover that\nRusk is actually the Red Skull, who has launched a biological weapon attack on\nAmerica, intending to use the ensuing panic to gain control over America's\ngovernment and start a war with other countries. Falcon is instrumental in\ndefeating the Red Skull.[33]\n\nIt is around this period of time that, a new \"Captain America\" secretly\ncreated by the [Office of Naval\nIntelligence](/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Intelligence \"Office of Naval\nIntelligence\") (O.N.I.) goes rogue and begins eliminating anything and anyone\nhe sees as a source of terrorism. To draw out this agent (dubbed \"The [Anti-\nCap](/wiki/Anti-Cap \"Anti-Cap\")\"), O.N.I. leaks information about their\ninvolvement in a [biological weapons](/wiki/Biological_weapons \"Biological\nweapons\") project with the notorious Rivas Family, powerful Cuban drug lords.\nReporter and social activist Leila Taylor investigates this rumor and attempts\nto smuggle a sample of the virus into America, but she is arrested by U.S.\nforces in Cuba. Falcon, who is a friend of Taylor, breaks her out of prison\nand investigates her claims, destroying the Rivas Family's biological weapons\nlab and obtaining a sample of the mysterious virus they were developing for\nO.N.I. Falcon is able to fly Leila back to America (although his flying\nharness is destroyed in a hurricane) while Captain America follows Falcon's\ndirections and retrieves the virus sample. The Anti-Cap kills the head of the\nRivas family, and pursues Leila, Falcon, and Cap, intent on obtaining the\nvirus sample. After reuniting, Falcon and Captain America are able to barely\ndefeat the Anti-Cap. Realizing that O.N.I.'s goal was to draw out their rogue\nagent to execute him, Captain America arranges to have the Anti-Cap secretly\nimprisoned in the Wakandan embassy until O.N.I. agrees not to kill him.[34]\n\nSince Captain America and Falcon now possess both O.N.I.'s rogue agent and the\nlast remaining sample of O.N.I.'s virus, O.N.I. begins to put increasing\namounts of pressure on the heroes. Falcon is especially targeted – he had\nbroken Leila out of Federal Custody, and his criminal history makes it easier\nfor O.N.I. to create further false charges against him. Falcon soon finds\nhimself on the run from O.N.I.[_[volume & issue\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]\n\nMeanwhile, the superheroine the [Scarlet Witch](/wiki/Scarlet_Witch \"Scarlet\nWitch\"), having gone insane, begins using her powers to re-create many of the\nAvengers' greatest trials and tragedies. She destabilizes the Falcon's mind,\ncausing him to act increasingly like his \"Snap\" persona. He begins carrying a\ngun, keeps secrets from his friends, assaults Leila's boyfriend Norman when he\nprotests they go into hiding, and uses a high power rifle to shoot at his\nfriend [Robbie Robertson](/wiki/Robbie_Robertson_\\(comics\\) \"Robbie Robertson\n\\(comics\\)\") (to fool Robbie into thinking O.N.I. was threatening to kill\nhim). Although they succeed in exposing the illegal activities of O.N.I. and\nclear Wilson's name, Sam's methods cause his relationship with Captain America\nto become strained. Cap confronts Falcon about his recent actions, and Falcon,\nangered at what he sees as an ultimatum, terminates their partnership. As they\nare walking away, Norman (who blames Falcon for the end of his relationship\nwith Leila) appears and shoots at Falcon. Captain America is seriously injured\nby the stray bullets, and even appears to die. The shock of watching his best\nfriend seemingly die because of his actions has a powerful affect on Sam, who\nbriefly gives up being Falcon and reexamines his life.[35]\n\nSam Wilson reappears as Falcon in the 2005 \"[House of M](/wiki/House_of_M\n\"House of M\")\" storyline and in the 2006–07 \"[Civil\nWar](/wiki/Civil_War_\\(comics\\) \"Civil War \\(comics\\)\")\" storyline.[36] In the\nlatter, he supports Captain America against the [Superhuman Registration\nAct](/wiki/Superhuman_Registration_Act \"Superhuman Registration Act\"). When\nthe Captain becomes incapacitated, Falcon temporarily assumes leadership of\nthe \"Secret Avengers\" rebel group.[37] Following Captain America's\nassassination by the machinations of the Red Skull, the Falcon registers with\nthe government and is made responsible for Harlem, although he continues to\nmaintain contact with the underground [New\nAvengers](/wiki/The_New_Avengers_\\(comics\\) \"The New Avengers\n\\(comics\\)\").[38] He is also called upon to investigate the Captain's\nassassination by locating [Winter Soldier](/wiki/Bucky_Barnes \"Bucky Barnes\")\nand tracking down the Red Skull.[39]\n\n### Becoming Captain\nAmerica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Falcon_\\(comics\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Becoming Captain America\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/All-\nNew_Captain_America_Vol_1_1.jpg/170px-All-\nNew_Captain_America_Vol_1_1.jpg)](/wiki/File:All-\nNew_Captain_America_Vol_1_1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:All-New_Captain_America_Vol_1_1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWilson as Captain America on the cover of _All-New Captain America_ #1\n(November 2014).

When Karl Malus\nwas defeated, Captain America took Joaquin in.[47] When it was discovered\nJoaquin's bird/human hybrid condition wasn't temporary, Captain America\nlearned from [Claire Temple](/wiki/Claire_Temple \"Claire Temple\") that\nJoaquin's condition was permanent due to Redwing being vampiric and sporting a\nhealing factor.[48] When Captain America was captured by the Serpent Society\nand thrown out the window by [Viper](/wiki/Viper_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Viper\n\\(Marvel Comics\\)\"), he was saved by Joaquin.[49] Using his link with Redwing,\nCaptain America telepathically sent Joaquin the knowledge on how to fight\nwhere he held his own until [Misty Knight](/wiki/Misty_Knight \"Misty Knight\")\nand [Demolition Man](/wiki/Demolition_Man_\\(comics\\) \"Demolition Man\n\\(comics\\)\") showed up.

Upon not being able to\nsuccessfully locate Kobik, Steve Rogers decides to rally the heroes so that\nthey can take the fight to Baron Zemo.[52] In the aftermath of the incident,\nSteve and Sam plan to keep what happened at Pleasant Hill under wraps at the\ntime being.[53]\n\nAfter the \"Standoff!\" storyline, Sam begins to face public pressure to return\nthe shield and mantle of Captain America to Steve, as does Maria Hill for the\nconsequences of her actions on Pleasant Hill. He and Steve then begin to\nsecretly plan for a way to get Hill to face her crimes publicly. During a\npress conference, Sam encounters the mercenary\n[Chance](/wiki/Chance_\\(comics\\) \"Chance \\(comics\\)\") who was about to kill\nSteve in the middle of his speech. After defeating him, Sam receives a hero's\nwelcome when Steve announces him to the public as Captain America.

Intending to stop the fight, Wilson,\nalong with Redwing and Falcon, try to contain the situation.

As he leaves, he is attacked from\nbehind by [U.S. Agent](/wiki/U.S._Agent_\\(comics\\) \"U.S. Agent \\(comics\\)\").\nAfter a brief argument, Captain America and U.S. Agent begin to fight, with\nU.S. Agent gaining the upper hand, until Sam drags him into a tunnel where the\ndarkness and the great horned owls that reside in it allow him to win the\nfight.\n\nAfter defeating U.S. Agent and receiving an argument from Rage, Wilson returns\nto his headquarters where he decides to put a tiny implant in his brain that\nwill enhance his ability to see what birds see, enabling him to transmit them\ninto a data storage facility that converts them into images and videos. He\ndecides to further investigate the Americops to find proof of their violent\nactivities.[55]\n\nWhile accompanying Steve Rogers on a mission to stop [Flag-\nSmasher](/wiki/Flag-Smasher \"Flag-Smasher\")'s latest assault, Wilson fails to\nsave a senator from being shot by the villain, further compromising his\ncurrent public image. This is subsequently revealed to have been deliberately\nstaged by Rogers who has been converted to believe he is a Hydra sleeper agent\nsince childhood. Using his greater familiarity with the shield, Rogers\ndeliberately put Wilson in a position where he would be unable to use the\nshield to save the senator, with the final goal of demoralizing Sam to the\npoint where he will return the shield to Rogers of his own free will (not\nwanting to kill Wilson and risk creating a martyr).[56]\n\nAfter discovering that Rage was arrested and accused of robbing a pawn shop\nwhich [Man Mountain Marko](/wiki/Man_Mountain_Marko \"Man Mountain Marko\") and\n[Speed Demon](/wiki/Speed_Demon_\\(comics\\) \"Speed Demon \\(comics\\)\")\ncommitted, Sam offers him professional help from other heroes, but Rage turns\nit down, preferring that he should be the one to prove his innocence. After\nconsulting with his brother and Rogers, Sam posts a video on the internet\nshowing footage of the Americops beating up Rage, exposing their violent\nactivities. During Rage's trial, a frustrated Sam leaves the courtroom and\ncaptures Speed Demon, who confesses to his and Man Mountain Marko's\ninvolvement in the pawn shop robbery. Upon returning to the court, Misty tells\nSam that the verdict was already given. While people protest over Rage's\narrest, Sam tries his best to calm them. Sam leaves a letter which explains he\nis ending his role as Captain America and returning the shield to Steve\nRogers[57]\n\nDuring the 2017 \"[Secret Empire](/wiki/Secret_Empire_\\(comics\\) \"Secret Empire\n\\(comics\\)\")\" storyline, Sam has spent time alone in a desert and returns to\nthe city where he discovers Hydra's takeover and that Steve Rogers is their\nleader.

After crossing the tunnel, the group\ndeparts in a jet plane.[60] They arrive in a mansion where\n[Ultron](/wiki/Ultron \"Ultron\") resides, since he is in possession of the\nshard. They encounter Steve Rogers and his Avengers until Ultron captures\nthem. After a brief battle, Ultron allows them to leave and gives the shard to\nTony's team. Steve muses that he is unconcerned about who will acquire the\nfragments as he has an inside man in the Tony Stark A.I.'s team.[61]\n\nAfter a series of dead ends, the team returns to the hideout, where Sam\nreunites with Misty, until Hydra forces arrive and begin their assault on the\nbase. During the battle, Sam helps the other heroes in protecting the refugees\nand battling Hydra's Avengers and a revived Bruce Banner as the Hulk until the\nbase explodes.[62] In the aftermath of the attack, Sam appears standing on top\nof the rubble as Captain America to inspire the resistance to not\nsurrender.[63] It is later revealed that Sam had a conversation with Misty\nKnight and Rayshaun Lucas, the new [Patriot](/wiki/Patriot_\\(comics\\) \"Patriot\n\\(comics\\)\"), which has persuaded him to reassume the role of Captain America,\nleading the resistance and wielding Rogers' original round shield as a symbol\nof hope.[64] Sam uses the Cosmic Cube fragment acquired by the resistance to\nhelp destroy the Darforce dome surrounding Manhattan and the planetary defense\nshield, releasing all the trapped heroes. Liberating all the imprisoned\nInhumans, the Underground attacks the Capitol which attracts the attention of\nSteve Rogers, who arrives wearing Cosmic Cube-powered armor. During the final\nbattle, Sam fakes surrender and gives the fragment to Steve, only for Winter\nSoldier to intervene and bring Kobik and the real Steve Rogers back.
