\"Enlarge\")\n\nIn 2006, the State Herald of South Africa, [Themba Mabaso](/wiki/Themba_Mabaso\n\"Themba Mabaso\"), and the Deputy Herald, Marcel van Rossum, donned a\n[tabard](/wiki/Tabard \"Tabard\") with the emble of the republic at the XXVIIth\n[International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic\nSciences](/wiki/International_Congress_of_Genealogical_and_Heraldic_Sciences\n\"International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences\") in [St\nAndrews](/wiki/St_Andrews \"St Andrews\"), [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\")\n\nThe present [coat of arms](/wiki/Coat_of_arms \"Coat of arms\") of [South\nAfrica](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\") was introduced on [Freedom\nDay](/wiki/Freedom_Day_\\(South_Africa\\) \"Freedom Day \\(South Africa\\)\") 27\nApril 2000. It replaced [the earlier national\narms](/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa_\\(1910%E2%80%932000\\) \"Coat of arms\nof South Africa \\(1910–2000\\)\"), which had been in use since 1910.[1] The\nmotto __ǃke e: ǀxarra ǁke__ is written in the [Khoisan](/wiki/Khoisan\n\"Khoisan\") language of the [ǀXam](/wiki/%C7%80Xam \"ǀXam\") people and\ntranslates literally to \"diverse people unite\". The previous motto, in Latin,\nwas __[Ex Unitate Vires](/wiki/Ex_Unitate_Vires \"Ex Unitate Vires\")__ ,\ntranslated as \"From unity, strength\".\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Blazon\n  * 3 The oval shape of foundation\n  * 4 The oval shape of ascendance\n  * 5 1910 arms\n    * 5.1 Evolution\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe design process was initiated when, in 1999, the [Department of Arts,\nCulture, Science and\nTechnology](/wiki/Department_of_Arts_and_Culture_\\(South_Africa\\) \"Department\nof Arts and Culture \\(South Africa\\)\") requested ideas for the new coat-of-\narms from the public. A brief was then prepared based on the ideas received,\nalong with input from the Cabinet. The [Government Communication and\nInformation System](/wiki/Government_Communication_and_Information_System\n\"Government Communication and Information System\") then approached [Design\nSouth Africa](/w/index.php?title=Design_South_Africa&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Design South Africa \\(page does not exist\\)\") to brief ten of the top\ndesigners. Three designers were chosen to present their concepts to the\nCabinet. [Iaan Bekker](/w/index.php?title=Iaan_Bekker&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Iaan Bekker \\(page does not exist\\)\")'s design was chosen.\n\nThe new arms were introduced on Freedom Day, 27 April 2000. The change\nreflected the government's aim to highlight the democratic change in South\nAfrica and a new sense of patriotism.\n\nThe coat of arms is a series of elements organised in distinct symmetric egg-\nlike or oval shapes placed on top of one another. The completed structure of\nthe coat of arms combines the lower and higher oval shape in a symbol of\ninfinity. The path that connects the lower edge of the scroll, through the\nlines of the tusks, with the horizon above and the sun rising at the top,\nforms the shape of the cosmic egg from which the secretary bird rises. In the\nsymbolic sense, this is the implied rebirth of the spirit of the great and\nheroic nation of South Africa.\n\nThe coat of arms is also a central part of the Seal of the Republic,\ntraditionally considered to be the highest emblem of the State. Absolute\nauthority is given to every document with an impression of the Seal of the\nRepublic on it, as this means that it has been approved by the President of\nSouth Africa. Since 1997, however, the use of the Seal of the Republic has not\nactually been required by the Constitution, but it continues to be used.\n\n##\nBlazon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Blazon\")]\n\nThe official blazon of the arms is:\n\n> [Or](/wiki/Or_\\(heraldry\\) \"Or \\(heraldry\\)\"), representations of two San\n> human figures of red [ochre](/wiki/Ochre \"Ochre\"), statant respectant, the\n> hands of the innermost arms clasped, with upper arm, inner wrist, waist and\n> knee bands [Argent](/wiki/Argent \"Argent\"), and a narrow border of red\n> ochre; the shield ensigned of a spear and knobkierie in\n> [saltire](/wiki/Saltire#Heraldry \"Saltire\"),\n> [Sable](/wiki/Sable_\\(heraldry\\) \"Sable \\(heraldry\\)\"). Thereabove a demi-\n> secretary bird displayed Or, charged on the breast with a stylised\n> representation of a protea flower with outer petals\n> [Vert](/wiki/Vert_\\(heraldry\\) \"Vert \\(heraldry\\)\"), inner petals Or and\n> seeded of nine triangles conjoined in three rows, the upper triangle\n> [Gules](/wiki/Gules \"Gules\"), the second row Vert, Or inverted and Vert, and\n> the third row Vert, Or inverted, Sable, Or inverted and Vert. Above the head\n> of the secretary bird an arc of seven rays facetted Or and\n> [Orange](/wiki/Orange_\\(heraldry\\) \"Orange \\(heraldry\\)\"), the two outer\n> rays conjoined to the elevated wings.\n>\n> Upon a riband Vert, the motto __!KE E: /XARRA //KE__ in letters Argent.\n> Issuant from the ends of the riband two pairs of elephant tusks curving\n> inwards, the tips conjoined to the wings of the secretary bird, Or,\n> therewithin and flanking the shields, two ears of wheat\n> [Brunatré](/wiki/Brunatre \"Brunatre\").[2]\n\n## The oval shape of\nfoundation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: The oval shape of foundation\")]\n\nThe first element is the motto, in a green semicircle. Completing the\nsemicircle are two symmetrically placed pairs of elephant tusks pointing\nupwards. Within the oval shape formed by the tusks are two symmetrical ears of\nwheat, that in turn frame a centrally placed gold shield.\n\nThe shape of the shield makes reference to the drum, and contains two human\nfigures from [Khoisan](/wiki/Khoisan \"Khoisan\") rock art. The figures are\ndepicted facing one another in greeting and in unity.\n\nAbove the shield are a spear and a [knobkierie](/wiki/Knobkierie\n\"Knobkierie\"), crossed in a single unit. These elements are arranged\nharmoniously to give focus to the shield and complete the lower oval shape of\nfoundation.\n\n  * **The motto**\n\n    The motto is: !ke e: /xarra //ke, written in the [Khoisan language](/wiki/Khoisan_language \"Khoisan language\") of the /Xam people, literally meaning \"diverse people unite\". It addresses each individual effort to harness the unity between thought and action. On a collective scale it calls for the nation to unite in a common sense of belonging and national pride - unity in diversity.\n\n  * **The ears of wheat**\n\n    An emblem of fertility, it also symbolises the idea of germination, growth and the feasible development of any potential. It relates to the nourishment of the people and signifies :the agricultural aspects of the Earth.\n\n  * **Elephant tusks**\n\n    Elephants symbolise wisdom, strength, moderation and eternity.\n\n  * **The shield**\n\n    It has a dual function as a vehicle for the display of identity and of spiritual defence. It contains the primary symbol of our nation.\n\n  * **The human figures**\n\n    The figures are depicted in an attitude of greeting, symbolising unity. This also represents the beginning of the individual’s transformation into the greater sense of :belonging to the nation and by extension, collective humanity.\n\n  * **The spear and knobkierie**\n\n    A dual symbol of defence and authority, they in turn represent the powerful legs of the [secretary bird](/wiki/Secretary_bird \"Secretary bird\"). The spear and [knobkierie](/wiki/Knobkierie \"Knobkierie\") are lying down, symbolising peace.\n\n## The oval shape of\nascendance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: The oval shape of ascendance\")]\n\nImmediately above the oval shape of foundation, is the visual centre of the\ncoat of arms, a protea. The petals of the protea are rendered in a triangular\npattern reminiscent of the crafts of [Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\").\n\nThe [secretary bird](/wiki/Secretary_bird \"Secretary bird\") is placed above\nthe protea and the flower forms the chest of the bird. The secretary bird\nstands with its wings uplifted in a regal and uprising gesture. The\ndistinctive head feathers of the secretary bird crown a strong and vigilant\nhead. The rising sun above the horizon is placed between the wings of the\nsecretary bird and completes the oval shape of ascendance.\n\nThe combination of the upper and lower oval shapes intersect to form an\nunbroken infinite course, and the great harmony between the basic elements\nresult in a dynamic, elegant and thoroughly distinctive design. Yet it clearly\nretains the stability, gravity and immediacy that a coat of arms demands.\n\n  * **The King protea**\n\n    The [protea](/wiki/Protea \"Protea\") is an emblem of the beauty of our land and the flowering of our potential as a nation in pursuit of the African Renaissance. The protea symbolises the holistic :integration of forces that grow from the Earth and are nurtured from above. The most popular colours of Africa have been assigned to the protea – green, gold, red and black.\n\n  * **The secretary bird**\n\n    The [secretary bird](/wiki/Secretary_bird \"Secretary bird\") is characterised in flight, the natural consequence of growth and speed. It is the equivalent of the [lion](/wiki/Southern_African_lion \"Southern African lion\") on Earth. A powerful bird whose legs - depicted as the :spear and knobkierie - serve it well in its hunt for snakes, symbolising protection of the nation against its enemies. It is a messenger of the heavens and conducts its grace upon the Earth. In this sense it is a symbol of divine majesty. Its uplifted wings are an emblem of the ascendance of our nation, while simultaneously offering us its protection. It is :depicted in gold, which clearly symbolises its association with the sun and the highest power.\n\n  * **The rising sun**\n\n    An emblem of brightness, splendour and the supreme principle of the nature of energy. It symbolises the promise of rebirth, the active faculties of reflection, knowledge, good judgement and willpower. It is the symbol of the source of life, of light and the ultimate wholeness of humanity.\n\n## 1910\narms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 1910 arms\")]\n\nThe [first coat of\narms](/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa_\\(1910%E2%80%932000\\) \"Coat of arms\nof South Africa \\(1910–2000\\)\") was granted by [King George\nV](/wiki/King_George_V \"King George V\") by Royal Warrant on 17 September\n1910.[3] This was a few months after the formation of the [Union of South\nAfrica](/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa \"Union of South Africa\").\n\nIt was a combination of symbols representing the four provinces (formerly\ncolonies) that made up the Union.\n\n  * The first quarter is the figure of Hope, representing the [Colony of the Cape of Good Hope](/wiki/British_Cape_Colony \"British Cape Colony\").\n  * The two [wildebeests](/wiki/Wildebeest \"Wildebeest\") of the second quarter represent the [Colony of Natal](/wiki/Colony_of_Natal \"Colony of Natal\").\n  * The orange tree in the third quarter was used as the symbol of the [Orange Free State Republic](/wiki/Orange_Free_State_Republic \"Orange Free State Republic\").\n  * The wagon in the fourth quarter represented the [Transvaal](/wiki/South_African_Republic \"South African Republic\").\n  * The supporters are taken from the arms of the Orange River Colony and the Cape Colony.\n  * The [lion](/wiki/Lion_\\(heraldry\\) \"Lion \\(heraldry\\)\") holds four rods, bound together, symbolising the unification of the four former colonies.\n\nThe motto, _Ex Unitate Vires_ was officially translated as \"Union is Strength\"\nuntil 1961, and thereafter as \"Unity is Strength\".\n\n###\nEvolution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Evolution\")]\n\nMain article: [Coat of arms of South Africa\n(1910–2000)](/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa_\\(1910%E2%80%932000\\) \"Coat of\narms of South Africa \\(1910–2000\\)\")\n\nThree official renditions of the arms were used. The original rendition (1910)\nwas the only version used until 1930, and it continued to be used as the rank\nbadge of warrant officers in the [South African Defence\nForce](/wiki/South_African_Defence_Force \"South African Defence Force\") and\n[South African National Defence\nForce](/wiki/South_African_National_Defence_Force \"South African National\nDefence Force\") until 2002.
