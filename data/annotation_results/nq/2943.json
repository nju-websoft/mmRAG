This then gives\nthe contender an advantage towards the end of the competition or before, as\nthe opponent becomes tired, allowing the contender to execute devastating\noffensive maneuvers and thereby winning.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Origin of the term\n  * 2 Technique\n  * 3 Notable fights\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 See also\n\n## Origin of the term[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rope-a-\ndope&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Origin of the term\")]\n\nAccording to [Angelo Dundee](/wiki/Angelo_Dundee \"Angelo Dundee\"), the idea\nfor the strategy used against Foreman was suggested to Ali by boxing\nphotographer [George Kalinsky](/wiki/George_Kalinsky \"George Kalinsky\"), who\ntold him: \"Why don't you try something like that? Sort of a dope on the ropes,\nletting Foreman swing away but, like in the picture, hit nothing but air.\"\nPublicist John Condon then polished the phrase into \"rope-a-dope\".[1]\n\n## Technique[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rope-a-dope&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Technique\")]\n\nThe rope-a-dope is performed by a boxer assuming a protected stance (in Ali's\nclassic pose, lying against the ropes, which allows much of the punch's energy\nto be absorbed by the ropes' elasticity rather than the boxer's body). The\nboxer keeps their guard up and is prepared for the incoming blows, while\nlooking for opportunities to counter punch their opponent, who by mounting an\noffensive may have left themselves open to counters. By being in a defensive\nposture and being prepared for the incoming blows, the plan is to decrease the\nchances of being caught with a clean flush blow, as ideally a significant\nportion of the punches will land on the boxer's hands and arms, or will miss\ncompletely as a result of the boxer slipping the punch. Additionally, if the\nopponent lacks stamina, their power will decrease throughout the fight as they\nlose their energy, and essentially \"waste\" many punches into the boxer's\nguard.\n\nHowever, a boxer employing this tactic must have a great chin and great\nability to withstand punishment to be able to withstand the punches that do\nget through the boxer's defenses and land. Offensively, the boxer employing\nthis tactic will look to exploit mistakes made in their opponent's attack by\ncountering if the opponent has left themselves open. They will also look to\nmount short bursts of offensive attacks in between their opponent's attack,\nbeing sure to immediately get back in their defensive posture as to not leave\nthemselves open to a counter attack. Despite the name, the boxer does not have\nto be against the ropes in order to rope-a-dope the opponent.\n\n## Notable fights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rope-a-dope&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Notable fights\")]\n\nThe maneuver is most commonly associated with the match between Muhammad Ali\nand George Foreman, known as [The Rumble in the\nJungle](/wiki/The_Rumble_in_the_Jungle \"The Rumble in the Jungle\"). Foreman\nwas considered by many observers to be the favored to win the fight due to his\nsuperior punching power. During the match, Ali purposely angered Foreman,\nprovoking Foreman to attack and force him back on the ropes. At the time, some\nobservers thought that Ali was being horribly beaten and worried that they\nmight see him get killed in the ring.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Writer\n[George Plimpton](/wiki/George_Plimpton \"George Plimpton\") described Ali's\nstance as like \"a man leaning out his window trying to see something on his\nroof.\" However, far from being brutalized, Ali was relatively protected from\nForeman's blows. [Norman Mailer](/wiki/Norman_Mailer \"Norman Mailer\")\ndescribed the advantage of Ali's rope-a-dope this way: \"Standing on one's\nfeet, it is painful to absorb a heavy body punch even when blocked with one's\narm. The torso, the legs and the spine take the shock. Leaning on the ropes,\nhowever, Ali can pass it along; the rope will receive the strain.\"[2] Ali's\npreparation for the fight, which involved toughening himself up by allowing\nhis sparring partners to pummel him, contributed to observers' sense that Ali\nwas outmatched. But when Foreman became tired from the beating he was\ndelivering, Ali took advantage and won the match.\n\n[Manny Pacquiao](/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao \"Manny Pacquiao\") used the strategy to\ngauge the power of welterweight titlist [Miguel Cotto](/wiki/Miguel_Cotto\n\"Miguel Cotto\") in November 2009. Pacquiao followed up the rope-a-dope gambit\nwith a withering knockdown.\n\n[Nicolino Locche](/wiki/Nicolino_Locche \"Nicolino Locche\"), Argentine boxer\nnicknamed \"El Intocable\" (The Untouchable), used this technique extensively\nthroughout his career. He would get against the ropes and dodge nearly every\nsingle punch until his opponent would tire, then he would take him down with\n[combinations](/wiki/Striking_combination \"Striking combination\").\n\n[\"Irish\" Micky Ward](/wiki/Micky_Ward \"Micky Ward\") utilized this strategy\nduring many of the fights in the later part of his career. Ward would wait for\nhis opponent to become fatigued and would hit with either a left hook to the\nbody or any number of other combinations. This strategy led him to the junior\nwelterweight championship of the [WBU](/wiki/World_Boxing_Union \"World Boxing\nUnion\") where he took the belt from [Shea Neary](/wiki/Shea_Neary \"Shea\nNeary\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[Floyd Mayweather](/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather \"Floyd Mayweather\") often utilizes\nthis technique in his bouts, as he recently (August 2017) demonstrated against\n[Conor McGregor](/wiki/Conor_McGregor \"Conor McGregor\").[3]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rope-a-dope&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n**Notes**\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Angelo Dundee, Bert Randolph Sugar, [_My view from the corner: a life in boxing_](https://books.google.com/books?id=Far_wt1G3ysC&pg=PA172)\n  2. **Jump up ^** [Norman Mailer](/wiki/Norman_Mailer \"Norman Mailer\"). _[The Fight](/wiki/The_Fight_\\(book\\) \"The Fight \\(book\\)\")_.
