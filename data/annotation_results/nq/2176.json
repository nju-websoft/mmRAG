Created by\n[Victor Miller](/wiki/Victor_Miller_\\(writer\\) \"Victor Miller \\(writer\\)\"),\nwith contributions by Ron Kurz, [Sean S. Cunningham](/wiki/Sean_S._Cunningham\n\"Sean S. Cunningham\"), and [Tom Savini](/wiki/Tom_Savini \"Tom Savini\"), Jason\nwas not originally intended to carry the series as the main\n[antagonist](/wiki/Antagonist \"Antagonist\"). The character has subsequently\nbeen represented in various other media, including novels, video games, comic\nbooks, and [a cross-over film](/wiki/Freddy_vs._Jason \"Freddy vs. Jason\") with\nanother iconic horror film character, [Freddy Krueger](/wiki/Freddy_Krueger\n\"Freddy Krueger\").\n\nThe character has primarily been an antagonist in the films, whether by\nstalking and killing the other characters, or acting as a psychological threat\nto the protagonist, as is the case in _[Friday the 13th: A New\nBeginning](/wiki/Friday_the_13th:_A_New_Beginning \"Friday the 13th: A New\nBeginning\")_. Since Lehman's portrayal, the character has been represented by\nnumerous actors and [stuntmen](/wiki/Stunt_performer \"Stunt performer\"),\nsometimes by more than one at a time; this has caused some controversy as to\nwho should receive credit for the portrayal. [Kane Hodder](/wiki/Kane_Hodder\n\"Kane Hodder\") is the best known of the stuntmen to portray Jason Voorhees,\nhaving played the character in four consecutive films.[3][4]\n\nThe character's physical appearance has gone through many transformations,\nwith various special makeup effects artists making their mark on the\ncharacter's design, including makeup artist [Stan Winston](/wiki/Stan_Winston\n\"Stan Winston\"). Tom Savini's initial design has been the basis for many of\nthe later incarnations. The trademark [hockey goalie\nmask](/wiki/Goaltender_mask \"Goaltender mask\") did not appear until _[Friday\nthe 13th Part III](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_III \"Friday the 13th Part\nIII\")_. Since _[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason\nLives](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_VI:_Jason_Lives \"Friday the 13th Part VI:\nJason Lives\")_ , filmmakers have given Jason [superhuman\nstrength](/wiki/Superhuman_strength \"Superhuman strength\"), [regenerative\npowers](/wiki/Healing_factor \"Healing factor\"), and near invulnerability. He\nhas been seen as a sympathetic character, whose motivation for killing has\nbeen cited as being driven by the immoral actions of his victims and his own\nrage over having drowned as a child.[5] Jason Voorhees has been featured in\nvarious humor magazines, referenced in feature films, parodied in television\nshows, and was the inspiration for a [horror punk](/wiki/Horror_punk \"Horror\npunk\") band. Several toy lines have been released based on various versions of\nthe character from the _Friday the 13th_ films. Jason Voorhees's hockey mask\nis a widely recognized image in [popular culture](/wiki/Popular_culture\n\"Popular culture\").[6]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Appearances\n    * 1.1 Films\n    * 1.2 Literature\n  * 2 Concept and creation\n    * 2.1 Creating a monster\n    * 2.2 Men behind the mask\n    * 2.3 Design\n  * 3 Characteristics\n  * 4 In popular culture\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Bibliography\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Appearances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jason_Voorhees&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Appearances\")]\n\nJason Voorhees first appears during a nightmare of the main character\n[Alice](/wiki/List_of_Friday_the_13th_characters#Alice_Hardy \"List of Friday\nthe 13th characters\") ([Adrienne King](/wiki/Adrienne_King \"Adrienne King\"))\nin the original _Friday the 13th_ film; he becomes the main antagonist of the\nseries in its sequels. As well as the films, there have been books and comics\nthat have either [expanded the universe](/wiki/Expanded_universe \"Expanded\nuniverse\") of Jason, or been based on a minor aspect of him.\n\n### Films[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jason_Voorhees&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Films\")]\n\nJason made his first cinematic appearance in the original _[Friday the\n13th](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_\\(1980_film\\) \"Friday the 13th \\(1980 film\\)\")_ on\nMay 9, 1980. In this film, Jason is portrayed in the memories of his mother,\n[Mrs. Voorhees](/wiki/Pamela_Voorhees \"Pamela Voorhees\") ([Betsy\nPalmer](/wiki/Betsy_Palmer \"Betsy Palmer\")), and as a hallucination of the\nfilm's protagonist, [Alice](/wiki/Alice_\\(Friday_the_13th\\) \"Alice \\(Friday\nthe 13th\\)\") ([Adrienne King](/wiki/Adrienne_King \"Adrienne King\")). Though\nthe character makes no contemporary appearance onscreen, he propels the film's\nplot—Mrs. Voorhees, the cook at Camp Crystal Lake, seeks revenge for his\ndeath, which she blames on the camp counselors.[7] Jason's second appearance\nwas in the sequel, _[Friday the 13th Part 2](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_2\n\"Friday the 13th Part 2\")_ (1981). Revealed to be alive, an adult Jason exacts\nrevenge on Alice for decapitating his mother in the original film. Jason\n(Steven Dash and [Warrington Gillette](/wiki/Warrington_Gillette \"Warrington\nGillette\")), returns to Crystal Lake, living there as a [hermit](/wiki/Hermit\n\"Hermit\") and guarding it from all intruders. Five years later a group of\nteenagers arrive to set up a new camp, only to be murdered one by one by\nJason, who wears a pillow case over his head to hide his face.\n[Ginny](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Ginny_Field\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Amy\nSteel](/wiki/Amy_Steel_\\(actress\\) \"Amy Steel \\(actress\\)\")), the [lone\nsurvivor](/wiki/Final_girl \"Final girl\"), finds a cabin in the woods with a\nshrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees, and surrounded by\nmutilated corpses. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's\nshoulder. Jason is left for dead as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance.[8] In\n_[Friday the 13th Part III](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_III \"Friday the 13th\nPart III\")_ (1982), Jason ([Richard Brooker](/wiki/Richard_Brooker \"Richard\nBrooker\")) escapes to a nearby lake resort, Higgins Haven, to rest from his\nwounds. At the same time, [Chris\nHiggins](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Chris_Higgins\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Dana\nKimmell](/wiki/Dana_Kimmell \"Dana Kimmell\")) returns to the property with some\nfriends. An unmasked and reclusive Jason kills anyone who wanders into the\nbarn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face,\nhe leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris fends off Jason by\nslamming an axe into his head, but the night's events drive her into hysteria\nas the police take her away.[9]\n\n_[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter](/wiki/Friday_the_13th:_The_Final_Chapter\n\"Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter\")_ (1984) continues the story, with a\npresumed-dead Jason ([Ted White](/wiki/Ted_White_\\(stuntman\\) \"Ted White\n\\(stuntman\\)\")) found by the police and taken to the morgue. Jason awakens at\nthe morgue and kills an attendant and a nurse, and makes his way back to\nCrystal Lake. A group of teens renting a house there fall victim to Jason's\nrampage. Jason then seeks out\n[Trish](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Trish_Jarvis\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Kimberly\nBeck](/wiki/Kimberly_Beck \"Kimberly Beck\")) and [Tommy\nJarvis](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Tommy_Jarvis\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Corey\nFeldman](/wiki/Corey_Feldman \"Corey Feldman\")) next door. While Trish\ndistracts Jason, Tommy kills him.[10] _[Friday the 13th: A New\nBeginning](/wiki/Friday_the_13th:_A_New_Beginning \"Friday the 13th: A New\nBeginning\")_ follows Tommy Jarvis ([John\nShepherd](/wiki/John_Shepherd_\\(actor\\) \"John Shepherd \\(actor\\)\")), who was\ncommitted to a mental hospital after the events of _The Final Chapter_ , and\nhas grown up constantly afraid that Jason (Tom Morga) will return. Jason's\nbody was supposedly cremated after Tommy killed him. [Roy\nBurns](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Roy_Burns \"List\nof characters in the Friday the 13th series\") (Dick Wieand) uses Jason's\npersona to become a [copycat](/wiki/Copycat_crimes \"Copycat crimes\") killer at\nthe halfway home to which Tommy was moved. Jason appears in the film only\nthrough Tommy's dreams and hallucinations.[11] In _[Friday the 13th Part VI:\nJason Lives](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_VI:_Jason_Lives \"Friday the 13th Part\nVI: Jason Lives\")_ (1986), Tommy ([Thom Mathews](/wiki/Thom_Mathews \"Thom\nMathews\")), who has run away from a mental institution, visits Jason's grave\nand learns that Jason's body was never actually cremated, but buried in a\ncemetery near Crystal Lake. While attempting to destroy his body, Tommy\ninadvertently resurrects Jason ([C. J. Graham](/wiki/C._J._Graham \"C. J.\nGraham\")) via a piece of cemetery fence that acts as a [lightning\nrod](/wiki/Lightning_rod \"Lightning rod\"). Now possessing\n[superhuman](/wiki/Superhuman \"Superhuman\") abilities, Jason returns to\nCrystal Lake, now renamed Forest Green, and begins his killing spree anew.\nTommy eventually lures Jason back to the lake where he drowned as a child and\nchains him to a boulder on the lake floor, but almost dies in the process.\nTommy's friend, Megan Garris, finishes Jason off by cutting his face with a\nboat propeller.[12]\n\n_[Friday the 13th Part VII: The New\nBlood](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_VII:_The_New_Blood \"Friday the 13th Part\nVII: The New Blood\")_ (1988) begins an undisclosed amount of time after _Jason\nLives_. Jason ([Kane Hodder](/wiki/Kane_Hodder \"Kane Hodder\")) is freed from\nhis chains by the [telekinetic](/wiki/Psychokinesis \"Psychokinesis\") [Tina\nShepard](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Tina_Shepard\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Lar Park\nLincoln](/wiki/Lar_Park_Lincoln \"Lar Park Lincoln\")), who was attempting to\nresurrect her father. Jason begins killing those who occupy Crystal Lake, and\nafter a battle with Tina, is dragged back to the bottom of the lake by an\napparition of Tina's father.[13] _[Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes\nManhattan](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_VIII:_Jason_Takes_Manhattan \"Friday the\n13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\")_ (1989) sees Jason return from the\ngrave, brought back to life via an underwater electrical cable. He follows a\ngroup of students on their senior class trip to [Manhattan](/wiki/Manhattan\n\"Manhattan\"), boarding the _Lazarus_ to wreak havoc. Upon reaching Manhattan,\nJason kills all the survivors but\n[Rennie](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Rennie_Wickham\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Jensen\nDaggett](/wiki/Jensen_Daggett \"Jensen Daggett\")) and Sean ([Scott\nReeves](/wiki/Scott_Reeves \"Scott Reeves\")); he chases them into the sewers,\nwhere he is submerged in toxic waste and dies.[14] _[Jason Goes to Hell: The\nFinal Friday](/wiki/Jason_Goes_to_Hell:_The_Final_Friday \"Jason Goes to Hell:\nThe Final Friday\")_ (1993) marked the second time Jason was officially killed\naccording to studio canon. Through an unexplained resurrection, he returns to\nCrystal Lake, where he is hunted by the\n[FBI](/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation \"Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation\"). The FBI sets up a sting to kill Jason, which proves\nsuccessful. Through mystical [possession](/wiki/Demonic_possession \"Demonic\npossession\"), however, Jason survives by passing his [demon](/wiki/Demon\n\"Demon\")-infested heart from one being to the next. Though Jason does not\nphysically appear throughout most of the film, it is learned he has a half-\nsister and a niece, and that he needs them to retrieve and reinhabit his body.\nAfter resurrecting it, Jason is stabbed by his niece [Jessica\nKimble](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Jessica_Kimble\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Kari\nKeegan](/wiki/Kari_Keegan \"Kari Keegan\")) and dragged into Hell.[15]\n\n_[Jason X](/wiki/Jason_X \"Jason X\")_ (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last\nperformance as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after\nanother unexplained resurrection. Captured by the [U.S.\ngovernment](/wiki/U.S._government \"U.S. government\") in 2008, Jason is being\nexperimented upon in a research facility, where it has been determined that he\nhas regenerative capabilities and that [cryonic\nsuspension](/wiki/Cryopreservation \"Cryopreservation\") is the only possible\nsolution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute him have proved\nunsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices\nthrough the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing\nhimself and the only other survivor,\n[Rowan](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series \"List of\ncharacters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Lexa Doig](/wiki/Lexa_Doig \"Lexa\nDoig\")). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the\nteam's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing\nthe crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a regenerative\n[nanotechnology](/wiki/Nanotechnology \"Nanotechnology\") process, which gives\nhim an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to\nthe planet Earth 2, burning in the atmosphere.[16]\n\n_[Freddy vs. Jason](/wiki/Freddy_vs._Jason \"Freddy vs. Jason\")_ (2003) is a\ncrossover film in which Jason battles [_A Nightmare on Elm\nStreet_](/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_\\(franchise\\) \"A Nightmare on Elm\nStreet \\(franchise\\)\")'s villain [Freddy Krueger](/wiki/Freddy_Krueger \"Freddy\nKrueger\") ([Robert Englund](/wiki/Robert_Englund \"Robert Englund\")), a\nsupernatural killer who murders people in their dreams. Krueger has grown\nweak, as people in his home town of Springwood have suppressed their fear of\nhim. Freddy, who is impersonating Jason's mother ([Paula\nShaw](/wiki/Paula_Shaw \"Paula Shaw\")), resurrects Jason ([Ken\nKirzinger](/wiki/Ken_Kirzinger \"Ken Kirzinger\")) from Hell and sends him to\nSpringwood to cause panic and fear. Jason accomplishes this, but refuses to\nstop killing. A battle ensues in both the dream world and Crystal Lake. The\nidentity of the winner is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake\nholding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.[17]\n\nIn the 2009 [_Friday the 13th_ reboot](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_\\(2009_film\\)\n\"Friday the 13th \\(2009 film\\)\"), young Jason (Caleb Guss) witnesses his\nmother's ([Nana Visitor](/wiki/Nana_Visitor \"Nana Visitor\")) beheading as a\nchild and follows in her footsteps, killing anyone who comes to Crystal Lake.\nThe adult Jason ([Derek Mears](/wiki/Derek_Mears \"Derek Mears\")) kidnaps\n[Whitney\nMiller](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Whitney_Miller\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Amanda\nRighetti](/wiki/Amanda_Righetti \"Amanda Righetti\")), a girl who looks like his\nmother, and holds her prisoner in his underground tunnels. Months later,\nWhitney's brother\n[Clay](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Clay_Miller\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\") ([Jared\nPadalecki](/wiki/Jared_Padalecki \"Jared Padalecki\")) comes to Crystal Lake and\nrescues her. Eventually, Whitney uses Jason's devotion to his mother against\nhim, stabbing him with his own machete while he is distracted when she\nappears.[18]\n\n### Literature[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jason_Voorhees&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Literature\")]\n\nJason first appeared outside of film in the 1982\n[novelization](/wiki/Novelization \"Novelization\") of _Friday the 13th Part 3_\nby [Michael Avallone](/wiki/Michael_Avallone \"Michael Avallone\").[19] Avallone\nchose to use an alternate ending, which was filmed for _Part 3_ but never\nused, as the ending for his 1982 adaptation. In the alternate film ending,\nChris, who is in the canoe, hears Rick's voice and immediately rushes back to\nthe house. When she opens the door, Jason is standing there with a machete,\nand he decapitates her.[20] Jason next appears in print in the 1986\nnovelization of _Jason Lives_ by [Simon Hawke](/wiki/Simon_Hawke \"Simon\nHawke\"),[21] who also adapted the first three films in 1987 and\n1988.[22][23][24] _Jason Lives_ specifically introduced [Elias\nVoorhees](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_Friday_the_13th#Elias_Voorhees \"List of\ncharacters in Friday the 13th\"), Jason's father, a character that was slated\nto appear in the film but was cut by the studio.

Jason meets Leatherface, who\nadopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn\non each other.[28] In 1994 four [young adult\nnovels](/wiki/Young_adult_literature \"Young adult literature\") were released\nunder the title of _Friday the 13th_. They did not feature Jason explicitly,\nbut revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his\nmask.[29][30][31][32]\n\nIn 2003 and 2005, [Black Flame](/wiki/Black_Flame \"Black Flame\") published\nnovelizations of _Freddy vs. Jason_ and _Jason X_ respectively.[33][34] In\n2005 they began publishing a new series of novels; one set was published under\nthe _Jason X_ title, while the second set utilized the _Friday the 13th_\ntitle. The _Jason X_ series consisted of four sequels to the novelization of\nthe film. _Jason X: The Experiment_ was the first published. In this novel,\nJason is being used by the government, who are trying to use his\nindestructibility to create their own army of \"super soldiers\".[35] _Planet of\nthe Beast_ follows the efforts of Dr. Bardox and his crew as they try to clone\nthe body of a comatose Jason, and shows their efforts to stay alive when Jason\nwakes from his coma.[36] _Death Moon_ revolves around Jason crash-landing at\nMoon Camp Americana.[37] Jason is discovered below a prison site and\nunknowingly awakened in _To The Third Power_.

The series depicts various paranormal phenomena occurring\nat Crystal Lake. Jason's actions in this storyline are driven by the vengeful\nspirits of a Native American tribe wiped out on the lake by fur traders\nsometime in the 19th century.[49][50] On July 11 and August 15, 2007,\nWildstorm published a two-part special entitled _Friday the 13th: Pamela 's\nTale_. The two-issue comic book covers Pamela Voorhees' journey to Camp\nCrystal Lake and the story of her pregnancy with Jason as she recounts it to\nhitchhiker Annie, a camp counselor who was killed in the original film.[51]\nWildstorm released another two-part special, entitled _Friday the 13th: How I\nSpent My Summer Vacation_ , that was released on September 12 and October 10,\n2007. The comic book provides new insight into the psychology of Jason\nVoorhees as he befriends a boy born with a skull deformity.[52] Wildstorm\nreleased a six-issue series called _[Freddy vs. Jason vs.\nAsh](/wiki/Freddy_vs._Jason_vs._Ash \"Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash\")_ , starring\nthe two killers and [Ash](/wiki/Ash_Williams \"Ash Williams\") from the _[Evil\nDead](/wiki/Evil_Dead_\\(series\\) \"Evil Dead \\(series\\)\")_ series. In this\nstory, Freddy uses the _[Necronomicon](/wiki/Necronomicon_Ex-Mortis\n\"Necronomicon Ex-Mortis\")_ , which is in the Voorhees' basement, to escape\nfrom Jason's subconscious and \"gain powers unlike anything he's had before\".\nFreddy attempts to use Jason to retrieve the book, stating it will make him a\nreal boy. Ash, who is working at the local S-Mart in Crystal Lake, learns of\nthe book's existence and sets out to destroy it.[53] Wildstorm released\nanother two-issue miniseries on January 9 and February 13, 2008, titled\n_Friday the 13th: Bad Land_ , written and illustrated by Ron Marz and Mike\nHuddleston respectively. The miniseries features Jason stalking a trio of\nteenaged hikers taking shelter from a blizzard in Camp Crystal Lake.[54]\n\nA sequel to _Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash_ , subtitled _[The Nightmare\nWarriors](/wiki/Freddy_vs._Jason_vs._Ash:_The_Nightmare_Warriors \"Freddy vs.\nJason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors\")_ , was released by Wildstorm in 2009.\nJason escapes from the bottom of Crystal Lake to resume his hunt for Ash, but\nis captured by the U.S. government. Freddy helps him escape and appoints him\nthe general of his Deadite army, using the _Necronomicon_ to heal his\naccumulated injuries and decomposition; it removes his natural deformities in\nthe process. At the climax of the story, Jason battles his nemesis Tommy\nJarvis and his great-niece [Stephanie\nKimble](/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Friday_the_13th_series#Stephanie_Kimble\n\"List of characters in the Friday the 13th series\"); Stephanie impales him\nbefore Tommy decapitates him with a shard of glass.

Miller felt it was a \"creepy-sounding name\", which was\nperfect for his character.[56] Miller initially wrote Jason as a normal-\nlooking child, but the crew behind the film decided he needed to be deformed.\nVictor Miller explained Jason was not meant to be a [creature from the \"Black\nLagoon\"](/wiki/Creature_from_the_Black_Lagoon \"Creature from the Black\nLagoon\") in his script, and scripted Jason as a [mentally\ndisabled](/wiki/Developmental_disability \"Developmental disability\") young\nboy; it was Savini who made Jason deformed.[57] Ron Kurz confirmed that\nMiller's version of Jason was that of a normal child, but claims that it was\nhis idea to turn Jason into a \"mongoloid creature\", and have him \"jump out of\nthe lake at the end of the film\".[56] Miller later agreed the ending would not\nhave been as good if he looked like \"[Betsy Palmer](/wiki/Betsy_Palmer \"Betsy\nPalmer\") at eight years old\".[58] Miller wrote a scene where Alice dreams she\nis attacked in a canoe by Jason, and then she wakes up in a hospital bed.\nMiller's intention was to get as close to _[Carrie](/wiki/Carrie_\\(1976_film\\)\n\"Carrie \\(1976 film\\)\")_ 's ending as possible.[57] Savini believed having\nJason pop out of the lake would be psychologically disturbing to the audience,\nand since Alice is supposed to be dreaming, the crew could get away with\nadding anything they wanted.[57]\n\nWhen it came time to cast the role of Jason, Ari Lehman, who had received a\npart in Sean Cunningham's _Manny 's Orphans_,[59] arrived to read for the\ncharacter of Jack. Before he could get started, Cunningham walked in and\noffered him a different part: Jason. Without having read a single word,\nCunningham just looked at Ari and said, \"You're the right size, you've got\nit.\"[57] In the original _Friday the 13th_ , Ari Lehman is seen only in a\nbrief flashback as the surprise ending.[60] Subsequent actors who portrayed a\nyoung Jason include Timothy Burr Mirkovich in _Jason Takes Manhattan_ and\nSpencer Stump in _Freddy vs. Jason_. The adult role of Jason Voorhees has been\nplayed by various actors, some not credited, others taking great pride in\ntheir parts. Due to the physical demands the adult character requires, and the\nlack of emotional depth depicted, many of the actors since have been\n[stuntmen](/wiki/Stunt_double \"Stunt double\"). The most well-known among them\nis Kane Hodder, who is cited as the best to play the role.[3][4]\n\nMany ideas were suggested for the sequel to _Friday the 13th_ , including\nmaking the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film\nwould be its own story and not related to any previous film under the _Friday\nthe 13th_ moniker.[60] It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the\noriginal film, which suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The\ndirector Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as\nhe felt the audience wanted to know more about the child who attacked Alice in\nthe lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice did not see the \"real Jason\" in\nher dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up.[60]\nAfter killing Jason in _The Final Chapter_ , it was the director Joseph Zito's\nintention to leave the door open for the studio to make more films with Tommy\nJarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would\nbecome a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in _A\nNew Beginning_.[61] Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the\nidea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy's fear of Jason\nas the primary story.[61] This idea was immediately abandoned in _Jason Lives_\n, when _A New Beginning_ did not spark the \"creative success\" the studio was\nlooking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. wanted to bring Jason back,\nand he did not care how it was achieved.[62] In yet another alteration of the\nseries' continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had\nsurvived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort\nof supernatural force.[5] Since _A New Beginning_ , no sequel has attempted to\nreplace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not seen any of the\nsequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain.\nMiller believes the best part of his screenplay was that it was about a mother\navenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, \"Jason was dead from\nthe very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain.\"[63]\n\n### Men behind the\nmask[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jason_Voorhees&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Men behind the mask\")]\n\n\"... So I go from lead role to no role. Needless to say, I was disappointed.\nBut I said, 'What the hell?'\"\n\n—Steve Daskawisz, on losing screen credit[64]\n\nJason Voorhees went from deceased child to full-grown man for _Friday the 13th\nPart 2_ , and Warrington Gillette was hired to play the role. Gillette\nauditioned for the role of Paul; that role eventually went to John Furey.\nUnder the belief that he had attended the Hollywood Stuntman's School,\nGillette was offered the role of Jason Voorhees.[64] Initially Gillette was\nunsure about the character, but the idea of starring in his first film grew on\nGillette,[65] and he also thought the role was amusing.[64] It became apparent\nGillette could not perform the necessary stunts, so the stunt coordinator\nCliff Cudney brought in Steve Daskawisz.[66] Daskawisz filmed all of the\nscenes except the opening sequence and the unmasking shot at the end; Gillette\nreturned for the unmasking scenes. Gillette received credit for playing Jason,\nwhile Daskawisz was given credit as the stunt double. When _Part 3_ was\nreleased the following year, Daskawisz was credited as Jason for the reused\nfootage from the climax of the film.[9] Initially, Daskawisz was asked to\nreturn to the role for _Part 3_ , but it would have required him to pay for\nhis own transportation and housing during filming. Having secured a part on\n_[Guiding Light](/wiki/Guiding_Light \"Guiding Light\")_ , Daskawisz\ndeclined.[66]\n\nNow wanting a \"bigger and stronger-looking\" Jason, one that was also \"more\nathletic and powerful\", [Steve Miner](/wiki/Steve_Miner \"Steve Miner\") hired\nformer [British](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\")\n[trapeze](/wiki/Trapeze \"Trapeze\") artist [Richard\nBrooker](/wiki/Richard_Brooker \"Richard Brooker\"). After a simple\nconversation, Miner decided he was the right person for the job. Being new to\nthe country, Brooker believed that \"playing a psychopathic killer\" was the\nbest way into the movie business. Brooker became the first actor to wear\nJason's now-signature hockey mask. According to Brooker, \"It felt great with\nthe mask on. It just felt like I really was Jason because I didn't have\nanything to wear before that.\"[67] For _The Final Chapter_ , Joseph Zito\nbrought his own spin to the character, one that required a \"real hardcore\nstuntman\"; Ted White was hired to perform the role.[68] White, who only took\nthe job for the money, did \"get into the Jason psychology\" when he arrived on\nthe set. White went so far as to not speak to any of the other actors for long\nstretches.[68] As filming continued, White's experience was not pleasant, and\nin one instance, he went to battle for co-star [Judie\nAronson](/wiki/Judie_Aronson \"Judie Aronson\"), who played Samantha, when the\ndirector kept her naked in the lake for extended periods of time. Displeased\nwith his experience from filming, White had his name removed from the\ncredits.[69] As with _Friday the 13th Part 2_ , there was confusion over who\nperformed the role in _A New Beginning_ , partly because Jason is not the\nliteral antagonist in the film. When Ted White turned down the opportunity to\nreturn, Dick Wieand was cast.[70] Wieand is credited as Roy Burns, the film's\nactual murderer, but it was stuntman Tom Morga who performed in the few\nflashes of Jason, as well as portraying Roy in almost all of the masked\nscenes.[71] Wieand has been outspoken about his lack of enthusiasm over his\nrole in the film. Feeling alienated during the shoot, Wieand spent most of his\ntime in his trailer.[71] By comparison, Morga enjoyed his time as Jason and\nmade sure he \"really got into the character\".[70]\n\n\"It's like all of a sudden you get to put a baseball uniform on, and you're\nthe pitcher in the ninth inning of the [World Series](/wiki/World_Series\n\"World Series\"). It's an incredible feeling.\"\n\n—C. J. Graham, on his experience as Jason[72]\n\nA [nightclub](/wiki/Nightclub \"Nightclub\") manager in Glendale, [C. J.\nGraham](/wiki/C._J._Graham \"C. J. Graham\"), was interviewed for the role of\nJason in _Jason Lives_ , but was initially passed over because he had no\nexperience as a stuntman.[72] [Dan Bradley](/wiki/Dan_Bradley \"Dan Bradley\")\nwas hired, but Paramount executives felt Bradley did not have the right\nphysique to play the role, and Graham was hired to replace him.[73] Although\nBradley was replaced early during filming, he can be seen in the paintball\nsequence of the film.[25] Graham opted to perform most of his own stunts,\nincluding the scene where Jason catches on fire while battling Tommy in the\nlake.[73] The rest of the cast spoke highly of Graham, remarking that he never\ncomplained during all the uncomfortable situations he was placed in. Graham\nhad no intention of being an actor or a stuntman, but the idea of playing the\n\"bad guy\", and the opportunity to wear the prosthetics, intrigued him. Graham\nwas not brought back to reprise the role, but has often been cited as speaking\nhighly of his time in the part.[72]\n\nKane Hodder took over the role in _The New Blood_ , and played Jason in the\nnext four films. He previously worked alongside director [John Carl\nBuechler](/wiki/John_Carl_Buechler \"John Carl Buechler\") on a film called\n_[Prison](/wiki/Prison_\\(1988_film\\) \"Prison \\(1988 film\\)\")_. Based on his\nexperience working with Hodder, Buechler petitioned Frank Mancuso Jr. to hire\nhim, but Mancuso was apprehensive about Hodder's limited size. Knowing he\nplanned to use full body prosthetics, Buechler scheduled a test screening, the\nfirst in _Friday the 13th_ history for the character, and Mancuso immediately\ngave Hodder approval upon seeing him.[74] It is Buechler's contention that\nHodder gave Jason his first true personality, based on the emotions,\nspecifically the rage, that Hodder would emit while acting the part.[74]\nAccording to Hodder, he wanted to \"get in touch with Jason's thirst for\nrevenge\" and try to better understand his motivation to kill.[75] After\nviewing the previous films, Hodder decided that he would approach Jason as a\nmore \"quick and agile\" individual than he had been portrayed in the previous\nsequels.[75] John Carl Buechler felt that Kane had \"natural affinity for the\nrole\"—so much that Kane's appearance, when wearing the mask, would often\nterrify the cast, the crew, and in one incident a lone stranger that he came\nacross on his walk back to his trailer.[75] Initially Frank Mancuso Jr. and\nBarbara Sachs planned to use a Canadian stuntperson for _Jason Takes\nManhattan_. Hodder acted as his own voice, calling and requesting that he be\nallowed to reprise the role; the ultimate decision was left to director Rob\nHedden, who intended to use Hodder, because he felt Hodder knew the lore of\nthe series.[76] With Sean Cunningham's return as producer for _Jason Goes to\nHell_ , Hodder felt his chances of reprising the role were even better: Hodder\nhad worked as Cunningham's stunt coordinator for years.[77] Regardless, Adam\nMarcus, the director for _Jason Goes to Hell_ , always intended to hire Hodder\nfor the role.[77] _Jason X_ would mark Hodder's last performance as Jason, to\ndate. Todd Farmer, who wrote the screenplay for _Jason X_ , knew Hodder would\nplay Jason from the beginning. Jim Isaac was a fan of Hodder's work on the\nprevious films, so hiring him was an easy decision.[78]\n\n[New Line](/wiki/New_Line_Cinema \"New Line Cinema\") believed _Freddy vs.\nJason_ needed a fresh start, and choose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham\ndisagreed with their decision, believing Hodder was the best choice for the\nrole.[79] Hodder did receive the script for _Freddy vs. Jason_ , and had a\nmeeting with director [Ronny Yu](/wiki/Ronny_Yu \"Ronny Yu\") and New Line\nexecutives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit\nYu's image of Jason.[79] According to Hodder, New Line failed to provide him\nwith a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more\ndeliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in\nthe previous films.[80] Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized the\noutcry among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their\nchoice in recasting.[79]\n\nThe role eventually went to [Ken Kirzinger](/wiki/Ken_Kirzinger \"Ken\nKirzinger\"), a Canadian stuntman who worked on _Jason Takes Manhattan_. There\nare conflicting reports over the reason Kirzinger was cast. According to Yu,\nKirzinger was hired because he was taller than Robert Englund, the actor who\nportrays Freddy Krueger. Kirzinger stands 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m), compared\nto the 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) of Kane Hodder, and Yu wanted a much larger\nactor to tower over the 5-foot-10-inch (1.78 m) Englund. Kirzinger believes\nhis experience on _Part VIII_ helped him land the part, as Kirzinger doubled\nfor Hodder on two scenes for the film,[79] but also believes he was simply\nsized up and handed the job.[80] Although he was hired by the creative crew,\nNew Line did not officially cast Kirzinger until first seeing him on film.\nKirzinger's first scene was Jason walking down Elm Street. New Line wanted a\nspecific movement in Jason's walk; Kirzinger met their expectations and signed\na contract with the studio.[79] However, concerns that test audiences were\nconfused by the film's original ending caused the studio to reshoot the final\nscene. Actor [Douglas Tait](/wiki/Douglas_Tait_\\(stuntman\\) \"Douglas Tait\n\\(stuntman\\)\") was brought in to film the new ending, as he was available for\nthe reshoot and had been the production's second choice to portray the role of\nJason during the original casting.[81]\n\nFor the 2009 remake, stuntman [Derek Mears](/wiki/Derek_Mears \"Derek Mears\")\nwas hired to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special\neffects supervisor Scott Stoddard.[82] Mears's pleasant demeanor had the\nstudio worried about his ability to portray such a menacing character on\nscreen, but Mears assured them he would be able to perform the role.[83] When\nMears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over\njust another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to\n[Greek mask work](/wiki/Theatre_of_ancient_Greece \"Theatre of ancient\nGreece\"), where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based\non the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the\nperformance.[84]\n\n### Design[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jason_Voorhees&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Design\")]\n\nThe physical design of Jason Voorhees has gone through changes, some subtle\nand some radical. For _Friday the 13th_ , the task of coming up with Jason's\nappearance was the responsibility of [Tom Savini](/wiki/Tom_Savini \"Tom\nSavini\"), whose design for Jason was inspired by someone Savini knew as a\nchild whose eyes and ears did not line up straight.[57] The original design\ncalled for Jason to have hair, but Savini and his crew opted to make him\nbald,[56] so he would look like a \"[hydrocephalic](/wiki/Hydrocephalus\n\"Hydrocephalus\"), mongoloid pinhead\", with a dome-shaped head.[57] Savini\ncreated a plaster mold of Ari Lehman's head and used that to create\nprosthetics for his face.[56] Lehman personally placed mud—from the bottom of\nthe lake—all over his body to make himself appear \"really slimy.\"[56]\n\nFor _Part 2_ , Steve Miner asked Carl Fullerton, the make-up effects\nsupervisor, to stick to Savini's original design, but Fullerton only had one\nday to design and sculpt a new head. Fullerton drew a rough sketch of what he\nbelieved Jason should look like, and had it approved by Miner.[64] Fullerton\nadded long hair to the character. Gillette had to spend hours in a chair as\nthey applied rubber forms all over his face, and had to keep one eye closed\nwhile the \"droopy eye\" application was in place. Gillette's eye was closed for\ntwelve hours at a time while he was filming the final scenes of the film.\nFalse teeth created by a local dentist were used to distort Gillette's\nface.[64] Much of the basic concept of Fullerton's design was eliminated for\n_Part 3_. Miner wanted to use a combination of the designs from Tom Savini and\nCarl Fullerton, but as work progressed the design began to lean more and more\ntoward Savini's concept.[85] [Stan Winston](/wiki/Stan_Winston \"Stan Winston\")\nwas hired to create a design for Jason's head, but the eyes were level and\nDoug White, the make-up artist for _Part 3_ , needed a droopy right eye. White\ndid keep Winston's design for the back of the head, because the crew did not\nhave the time to design an entirely new head for Jason.[85] The process of\ncreating Jason's look was hard work for White, who had to constantly make\nalterations to Richard Brooker's face, even up to the last day of filming.[85]\n\n[![The actor wears a modified goalie mask. Three red triangles have been\npainted on the\nmask.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/Jasonmask.jpg/220px-\nJasonmask.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jasonmask.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jasonmask.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJason's original mask was [molded](/wiki/Molding_\\(process\\) \"Molding\n\\(process\\)\") from a [Detroit Red Wings](/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings \"Detroit Red\nWings\") goalie mask, and would become a staple for the character for the rest\nof the series.\n\nThe script for _Part 3_ called for Jason to wear a mask to cover his face,\nhaving worn a bag over his head in _Part 2_ ; what no one knew at the time was\nthat the mask chosen would become a trademark for the character, and one\ninstantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come.[6] During\nproduction, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew\nwanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw\na mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a\nhockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a\n[Detroit Red Wings](/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings \"Detroit Red Wings\") goaltender\nmask for the test.[86] Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a\nsubstance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold\nto work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red\ntriangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into\nthe mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's\nmask.[86] There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to\nwear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11\ndifferent appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this\nmask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes\nwhere the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This\none-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not\nthe rest of his head.[86]\n\nTom Savini agreed to return to make-up duties for _The Final Chapter_ because\nhe felt he should be the one to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look\nfrom child to man.[87] Savini used his design from the original _Friday the\n13th_ , with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted\nWhite's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in _A New Beginning_ , it\nwas not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask\nto cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing\nthe hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who\ncites _A New Beginning_ as almost a direct sequel to _The Final Chapter_ , did\nbase his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for _The Final Chapter_.[88]\n\n_Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood_ sought to make Jason more of a\n\"classic monster along the lines of Frankenstein.\"[89] From the beginning,\nBuechler tried to tie the previous films together by having Jason's appearance\nreflect that of the damage he received in the previous installments. Buechler\nwanted the motor boat damage from _Jason Lives_ , and the axe and machete cuts\nJason received in _Part 3_ and _Part 4_ to part of the design for _The New\nBlood_.[74] Since Jason had been submerged under water in the previous entry,\nthe effects team wanted Jason to appear \"rotted\", with bones and ribs showing,\nand for Jason's features to have a more defined feel to them.[89] [Howard\nBerger](/wiki/Howard_Berger \"Howard Berger\") was inspired by Carl Fullerton's\ndesign in _The New Blood_ , and wanted to incorporate the exposed flesh\nconcept into his model for _Jason Goes to Hell_. Berger designed Jason's skin\nto overlap with the mask, to make it appear as if the skin and mask had fused\nand the mask could no longer be removed.[77] [Gregory\nNicotero](/wiki/Gregory_Nicotero \"Gregory Nicotero\") and Berger sculpted a\nfull-body, foam latex suit for Kane Hodder to wear under the costume. The idea\nwas to reveal as much of Jason's skin as possible, because Nicotero and Berger\nknew the physical character would not be seen for most of the film.[77]\n\n[![Two drawings show the artist's conception of Über-Jason. On the right, a\nman with a high-tech metallic right arm and left leg holds a machete. On the\nleft, a detailed drawing of the right\narm.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/JasonXdesign.jpg/220px-\nJasonXdesign.jpg)](/wiki/File:JasonXdesign.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:JasonXdesign.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOriginal concept drawings for \"Über-Jason\", by makeup effects supervisor\n[Stephan Dupuis](/wiki/Stephan_Dupuis \"Stephan Dupuis\"), took months to plan.\nDupuis sculpted a small-scale version of the new design to show off to the\nfilmmakers, before finally taking mold castings of Kane Hodder.[78]\n\nStephen Dupuis was given the task of redesigning Jason for the tenth _Friday\nthe 13th_ film. One concept brought into the film was Jason's regenerative\nabilities.[16] Dupuis gave the character more hair and more of a natural flesh\nappearance to illustrate the constant regeneration the character goes through;\nDupuis wanted a more \"[gothic](/wiki/Gothic_aesthetics \"Gothic aesthetics\")\"\ndesign for Jason, so he added chains and shackles, and made the hockey mask\nmore angular.[78] Jim Isaac and the rest of his crew wanted to create an\nentirely new Jason at some point in the film. The idea was for the teens to\ncompletely destroy Jason's body, allowing the futuristic technology to bring\nhim back to life.[78] What was referred to as Über-Jason was designed to have\nchunks of metal growing from his body, bonded by tendrils that grew into the\nmetal, all pushing through a leather suit. The metal was created from\nVacuForm, the same material used to increase the size of the original hockey\nmask, and was attached by Velcro. The tendrils were made from silicone. All of\nthe pieces were crafted onto one suit, including an entire head piece, which\nHodder wore. The make-up effects team added zippers along the side of the\nsuit, which allowed Hodder to enter and exit the suit within 15 minutes.[78]\n\nBy the time _Freddy vs. Jason_ entered production there had been ten previous\n_Friday the 13th_ films. Make-up effects artist Terezakis wanted to put his\nown mark on Jason's look—he wanted Jason to be less rotted and decomposed and\nmore defined, so that the audience would see a new Jason, but still recognized\nthe face. Terezakis tried to keep continuity with the previous films, but\nrecognized that had he followed them too literally, then \"Jason would have\nbeen reduced to a pile of goo.\"[79] Ronny Yu wanted everything surrounding the\nhockey mask to act as a frame, making the mask the focal point of each shot.\nTo achieve this, Terezakis created a \"pooled-blood look\" for the character by\npainting the skin black, based on the idea the blood had pooled in the back of\nhis head because he had been lying on his back for a long time. As with other\nmake-up artists before him, Terezakis followed Savini's original skull design,\nand aged it appropriately.[79]\n\nFor the 2009 version of _Friday the 13th_ , effects artist Scott Stoddard took\ninspiration from Carl Fullerton's design in _Friday the 13th Part 2_ and Tom\nSavini's work in _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter_. Stoddard wanted to make\nsure that Jason appeared human and not like a monster. Stoddard's vision of\nJason includes hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his\nface, but he attempted to craft Jason's look in a way that would allow for a\nmore human side to be seen.[83] Stoddard took inspiration from the third and\nfourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. The make-up artist managed to\nacquire an original set piece, which he studied and later sculpted. Although\nhe had a model of one of the original masks, Stoddard did not want to\nreplicate it in its entirety. As Stoddard explains, \"Because I didn't want to\ntake something that already existed, there were things I thought were great,\nbut there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all\nthe fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks.\nAge them down a bit, break them up.\" In the end, Stoddard crafted six versions\nof the mask, each with varying degrees of wear.[83]\n\n##\nCharacteristics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jason_Voorhees&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Characteristics\")]\n\nIn his original appearance, Jason was scripted as a [mentally\ndisabled](/wiki/Developmental_disability \"Developmental disability\") young\nboy.[90] Since _Friday the 13th_ , Jason Voorhees has been depicted as a non-\nverbal, indestructible, [machete](/wiki/Machete \"Machete\")-wielding mass\nmurderer.[91][92] Jason is primarily portrayed as being completely silent\nthroughout the film series. Exceptions to this include flashbacks of Jason as\na child, and a brief scene in _Jason Takes Manhattan_ where the character\ncries out \"Mommy, please don't let me drown!\" in a child's voice before being\nsubmerged in toxic waste, and in _Jason Goes To Hell_ where his spirit\npossesses other individuals.[57] Online magazine [Salon](/wiki/Salon.com\n\"Salon.com\")'s Andrew O'Hehir describes Jason as a \"silent,\nexpressionless...blank slate.\"[93] When discussing Jason psychologically, Sean\nS. Cunningham said, \"...he doesn't have any personality. He's like a [great\nwhite shark](/wiki/Great_white_shark \"Great white shark\"). You can't really\ndefeat him. All you can hope for is to survive.\"[94] Since _Friday the 13th\nPart VI: Jason Lives_ , Jason has been a \"virtually indestructible\" being. Tom\nMcLoughlin, the film's director, felt it was silly that Jason had previously\nbeen just another guy in a mask, who would kill people left and right, but get\n\"beaten up and knocked down by the heroine at the end\". McLoughlin wanted\nJason to be more of a \"formidable, unstoppable monster\".[25] In resurrecting\nJason from the dead, McLoughlin also gave him the weakness of being rendered\nhelpless if trapped beneath the waters of Crystal Lake; inspired by vampire\nlore, McLoughlin decided that Jason had in fact drowned as a child, and that\nreturning him to his original resting place would immobilize him.[95] This\nweakness would be presented again in _The New Blood,_ and the idea that Jason\nhad drowned as a child was taken up by director Rob Hedden as a plot element\nin _Jason Takes Manhattan._[57]\n\nMany have given suggestions as Jason's motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger\nrefers to Jason as a \"psychotic mama's boy gone horribly awry...very\nresilient. You can't kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone\nelse.\"[96] Kirzinger goes on to say that Jason is a \"psycho-savant\", and\nbelieves his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything\npersonal.[79] Andrew O'Hehir has stated, \"Coursing hormones act, of course, as\nsmelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of [William\nBennett](/wiki/William_Bennett \"William Bennett\")-style values.\"[93] Todd\nFarmer, writer for _Jason X_ , wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic\nhibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea\nthat sex acts triggered Jason back to life.[78] Whatever his motivations, Kane\nHodder believes there is a limit to what he will do. According to Hodder,\nJason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when _Jason Takes\nManhattan_ called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused,\nstating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not bad\nenough to [hurt](/wiki/Animal_abuse \"Animal abuse\") animals.[97] Another\nexample from _Jason Takes Manhattan_ , involves Jason being confronted by a\nstreet gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife,\nhowever Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting\nup his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose\nnot to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in _Jason Lives,_\nstating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of\nchildren generated by his own death as a child.[95]\n\nIn an early draft of _Freddy vs. Jason_ , it was decided that one of the\nvillains needed a redeemable factor. [Ronald D. Moore](/wiki/Ronald_D._Moore\n\"Ronald D. Moore\"), co-writer of the first draft, explained that Jason was the\neasiest to make redeemable, because no one had previously ventured into the\npsychology surrounding the character. Moore saw the character as a \"blank\nslate\", and felt he was a character the audience could really root for.[98]\nAnother draft, penned by Mark Protosevich, followed Moore's idea of Jason\nhaving a redeemable quality. In the draft, Jason protects a pregnant teenager\nnamed Rachel Daniels. Protosevich explained, \"It gets into this whole idea of\nthere being two kinds of monsters. Freddy is a figure of actual pure evil and\nJason is more like a figure of vengeance who punishes people he feels do not\ndeserve to live. Ultimately, the two of them clash and Jason becomes an\nhonorable monster.\"[98] Writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, who wrote the\nfinal draft of the film, disagreed about making Jason a hero, although they\ndrew comparisons between the fact that Freddy was a victimizer and Jason was a\nvictim. They stated, \"We did not want to make Jason any less scary. He's still\na brutal killer ... We never wanted to put them in a situation where Jason is\na hero ... They're both villains to be equally feared.\"[98] Brenna O'Brien,\nco-founder of Fridaythe13thfilms.com, saw the character as having sympathetic\nqualities. She stated, \"[Jason] was a deformed child who almost drowned and\nthen spent the rest of his childhood growing up alone in the woods. He saw his\nmother get murdered by a camp counselor in the first _Friday the 13th_ , and\nso now he exacts his revenge on anyone who returns to Camp Crystal Lake.\nTeenage fans can identify with that sense of rejection and isolation, which\nyou can't really get from other killers like [Freddy\nKrueger](/wiki/Freddy_Krueger \"Freddy Krueger\") and [Michael\nMyers](/wiki/Michael_Myers_\\(Halloween\\) \"Michael Myers \\(Halloween\\)\").\"[6]\n\nAs Jason went through some characterization changes in the 2009 film, Derek\nMears likens him more to a combination of [John Rambo](/wiki/John_Rambo \"John\nRambo\"), [Tarzan](/wiki/Tarzan \"Tarzan\"), and the Abominable Snowman from\n_[Looney Tunes](/wiki/Looney_Tunes \"Looney Tunes\")_. To him, this Jason is\nsimilar to Rambo because he sets up the other characters to fall into his\ntraps. Like Rambo, he is more calculated because he feels that he has been\nwronged and he is fighting back; he is meant to be more sympathetic in this\nfilm.[99] Fuller and Form contend that they did not want to make Jason too\nsympathetic to the audience. As Brad Fuller explains, \"We do not want him to\nbe sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He's\na killing machine. Plain and simple.\"[100]\n\nIn 2005, [California State University](/wiki/California_State_University\n\"California State University\")'s Media Psychology Lab surveyed 1,166 people\nAmericans aged from 16 to 91 on the psychological appeal of movie monsters.\nMany of the characteristics associated with Jason Voorhees were appealing to\nthe participants. In the survey, Jason was considered to be an \"unstoppable\nkilling machine.\" Participants were impressed by the \"cornucopic feats of\nslicing and dicing a seemingly endless number of adolescents and the\noccasional adult.\" Out of the ten monsters used in the survey—which included\n[vampires](/wiki/Vampire \"Vampire\"), Freddy Krueger, [Frankenstein's\nmonster](/wiki/Frankenstein%27s_monster \"Frankenstein's monster\"), Michael\nMyers, [Godzilla](/wiki/Godzilla \"Godzilla\"),\n[Chucky](/wiki/Chucky_\\(Child%27s_Play\\) \"Chucky \\(Child's Play\\)\"), [Hannibal\nLecter](/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter \"Hannibal Lecter\"), [King Kong](/wiki/King_Kong\n\"King Kong\"), and [the Alien](/wiki/Alien_\\(creature_in_Alien_franchise\\)\n\"Alien \\(creature in Alien franchise\\)\")—Jason scored the highest in all the\ncategories involving killing variables. Further characteristics that appealed\nto the participants included Jason's \"immortality, his apparent enjoyment of\nkilling [and] his superhuman strength.\"[101]\n\n## In popular\nculture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jason_Voorhees&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: In popular culture\")]\n\n[![Packaging for the Jason Friday the 13th model kit has a picture of the toy,\ndressed in leather and goalie mask, and holding a\nmachete.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1e/Jasonmodelkit.jpg/170px-\nJasonmodelkit.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jasonmodelkit.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jasonmodelkit.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIn 1988, Screamin' toys introduced the build-it yourself Jason figure.\n\nJason Voorhees is one of the leading [cultural icons](/wiki/Cultural_icon\n\"Cultural icon\") of American [popular culture](/wiki/Popular_culture \"Popular\nculture\").[101][102][103] In 1992 Jason was awarded the [MTV](/wiki/MTV \"MTV\")\n[Lifetime Achievement Award](/wiki/Lifetime_Achievement_Award \"Lifetime\nAchievement Award\").[104] He was the first of only three completely fictional\ncharacters to be presented the award; [Godzilla](/wiki/Godzilla \"Godzilla\")\n(1996) and [Chewbacca](/wiki/Chewbacca \"Chewbacca\") (1997) are the\nothers.[105][106] Jason was named No. 26 in\n_[Wizard](/wiki/Wizard_\\(magazine\\) \"Wizard \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine's \"100\ngreatest villains of all time\".[107] [Universal Studios theme\nparks](/wiki/Universal_Studios_Theme_Parks \"Universal Studios Theme Parks\"),\nin collaboration with New Line Cinema, used the character for their Halloween\nHorror Nights event.[108]\n\nThe character has been produced and marketed as merchandise over the years. In\n1988 Screamin' Toys produced a model kit where owners could build their own\nJason statuette. The kit required the owner to cut and paint various parts in\norder to assemble the figure.[109] Six years later, Screamin' Toys issued a\nnew model kit for _Jason Goes to Hell_. Both kits are now out of\nproduction.[110] [McFarlane Toys](/wiki/McFarlane_Toys \"McFarlane Toys\")\nreleased two toy lines, one in 1998 and the other in 2002. The first was a\nfigure of Jason from _Jason Goes to Hell_ ,[111] and the other was of Über-\nJason from _Jason X_.[112] Since McFarlane's last toy line in 2002, there has\nbeen a steady production of action figures, dolls, and statuettes. These\ninclude tie-ins with the film _Freddy vs. Jason_ (2003).[113] In April 2010\nSideshow Toys released a polystone statue of Jason, based on the version\nappearing in the 2009 remake.[114]\n\nJason has made an appearance in five video games. He first appeared in a 1985\n[Commodore 64](/wiki/Commodore_64 \"Commodore 64\") game.[115] His next\nappearance was in 1989, when [LJN](/wiki/LJN \"LJN\"), an American game company\nknown for its games based on popular movies in the 1980s and early 1990s,\nreleased [_Friday the 13th_](/wiki/Friday_the_13th_\\(NES_game\\) \"Friday the\n13th \\(NES game\\)\") on the [Nintendo Entertainment\nSystem](/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System \"Nintendo Entertainment System\").\nThe premise involved the gamer, who picks one of six camp counselors as their\nplayer, trying to save the campers from Jason, while battling various enemies\nthroughout the game.[116] On October 13, 2006, a _Friday the 13th_ game was\nreleased for [mobile phones](/wiki/Mobile_phone \"Mobile phone\"). The game puts\nthe user in the persona of Jason as he battles the undead.[117] Jason also\nappears as a playable character in the fighting game _[Mortal Kombat\nX](/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_X \"Mortal Kombat X\")_ as a downloadable content bonus\ncharacter.[118] A new _[Friday the 13th video\ngame](/wiki/Friday_the_13th:_The_Game \"Friday the 13th: The Game\")_ was\nreleased in 2017, which allows players to take control of Jason or camp\ncounselors in a multiplayer format focused on Jason trying to kill the\ncounselors before they can escape or time runs out.\n\nThe character has been referenced, or made cameo appearances, in various\nentertainment mediums. Outside of literature sources based on the character,\nJason has been featured in a variety of magazines and comic strips.\n_[Cracked](/wiki/Cracked_\\(magazine\\) \"Cracked \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine has\nreleased several issues featuring parodies of Jason, and he has been featured\non two of their covers.[107] _[Mad](/wiki/Mad_\\(magazine\\) \"Mad\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine has featured the character in almost a dozen stories.\nHe has appeared twice in the comic strip _[Mother Goose and\nGrimm](/wiki/Mother_Goose_and_Grimm \"Mother Goose and Grimm\")_.[107] The\n_[Usagi Yojimbo](/wiki/Usagi_Yojimbo \"Usagi Yojimbo\")_ antagonist Jei is based\non Voorhees; his name, with the honorific \"-san\" attached, is in fact a pun on\nVoorhees' first name.[119]\n\n\"_...Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up  \nTo make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass  \nAnd if it's not a rapper that I'll make it as  \nI'mma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask._\"\n\n—Final verse to [Eminem](/wiki/Eminem \"Eminem\")'s \"Criminal\"[120]\n\nMany musical artists have made references to Jason Voorhees. Inspired by his\nown experience, Ari Lehman founded a band called FIRSTJASON. Lehman's band is\nclassified as [horror punk](/wiki/Horror_punk \"Horror punk\"), and is\ninfluenced by the sounds of the [Dead Kennedys](/wiki/Dead_Kennedys \"Dead\nKennedys\") and [The Misfits](/wiki/Misfits_\\(band\\) \"Misfits \\(band\\)\").[121]\nThe band's name pays homage to Lehman's portrayal of Jason Voorhees in the\noriginal _Friday the 13th_. One of the band's songs is entitled \"Jason is\nWatching\".[121] In 1986, coinciding with the release of _Jason Lives_ , [Alice\nCooper](/wiki/Alice_Cooper \"Alice Cooper\") released \"[He's Back (The Man\nBehind the Mask)](/wiki/He%27s_Back_\\(The_Man_Behind_the_Mask\\) \"He's Back\n\\(The Man Behind the Mask\\)\")\" from his album\n_[Constrictor](/wiki/Constrictor_\\(album\\) \"Constrictor \\(album\\)\")_. The song\nwas written to \"signal Jason's big return\" to the cinema, as he had been\nalmost entirely absent in the previous film.[122] [Rapper](/wiki/Rapping\n\"Rapping\") [Eminem](/wiki/Eminem \"Eminem\") has referenced Jason in several of\nhis songs. The song \"Criminal\", from the album _[The Marshall Mathers\nLP](/wiki/The_Marshall_Mathers_LP \"The Marshall Mathers LP\")_ , mentions Jason\nspecifically, while songs \"Amityville\" and \"Off the Wall\"—the latter featured\nfellow rapper [Redman](/wiki/Redman_\\(rapper\\) \"Redman \\(rapper\\)\")—contain\nHarry Manfredini's music \"ki, ki, ki ... ma, ma, ma\" from the film\nseries.[123] Eminem sometimes wears a hockey mask during concerts.[124] Other\n[rap artists](/wiki/Hip_hop_music \"Hip hop music\") that have referenced Jason\ninclude [Tupac Shakur](/wiki/Tupac_Shakur \"Tupac Shakur\"), [Dr.\nDre](/wiki/Dr._Dre \"Dr. Dre\"), [LL Cool J](/wiki/LL_Cool_J \"LL Cool J\"), and\n[Insane Clown Posse](/wiki/Insane_Clown_Posse \"Insane Clown Posse\").[123] In\n1989, [Puerto Rican](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_people \"Puerto Rican people\") rapper\n[Vico C](/wiki/Vico_C \"Vico C\") had a song titled \"Viernes 13\" which featured\nJason in [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto Rico\").[125] The song was so\npopular in the island that Vico C wrote a second part titled \"Viernes 13,\nParte II\".[126] [VH1](/wiki/VH1 \"VH1\") issued an advertisement for their Vogue\nFashion Awards which was labeled \"Friday the 20th\", and featured Jason's mask\ncreated out of [rhinestone](/wiki/Rhinestone \"Rhinestone\").[127]\n\nJason has been referenced or parodied in other films.[128] In the film\n_[Scream](/wiki/Scream_\\(1996_film\\) \"Scream \\(1996 film\\)\")_ , directed by\nFreddy Krueger creator [Wes Craven](/wiki/Wes_Craven \"Wes Craven\"), actress\n[Drew Barrymore](/wiki/Drew_Barrymore \"Drew Barrymore\")'s character is being\nstalked by a killer who calls her on her home phone. In order to survive, she\nmust answer the man's trivia questions. One question is \"name the killer in\n_Friday the 13th_.\" She incorrectly guesses Jason, who did not become the\nkiller for the film series until _Part 2_. Writer [Kevin\nWilliamson](/wiki/Kevin_Williamson_\\(screenwriter\\) \"Kevin Williamson\n\\(screenwriter\\)\") claimed his inspiration for this scene came when he asked\nthis question in a bar while a group was playing a movie trivia quiz game. He\nreceived a free drink, because nobody got the answer right.[129] In another\nWes Craven film, _[Cursed](/wiki/Cursed_\\(2005_film\\) \"Cursed \\(2005 film\\)\")_\n, a wax sculpture of Jason, from _Jason Goes to Hell_ , can be seen in a [wax\nmuseum](/wiki/Wax_museum \"Wax museum\").[130] In 2014, Jason made a cameo\nappearance in the [RadioShack](/wiki/RadioShack \"RadioShack\") [Super Bowl\nXLVIII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVIII \"Super Bowl XLVIII\") commercial \"[The '80s\nCalled](/wiki/The_%2780s_Called \"The '80s Called\")\".[131]\n\nJason has also been referenced by several television shows.[132] The [stop\nmotion](/wiki/Stop_motion \"Stop motion\") animated television show _[Robot\nChicken](/wiki/Robot_Chicken \"Robot Chicken\")_ features Jason in three of its\ncomedy sketches. In episode seventeen, \"[Operation: Rich in\nSpirit](/wiki/Operation:_Rich_in_Spirit \"Operation: Rich in Spirit\")\", the\nmystery-solving teenagers from _[Scooby-Doo](/wiki/Scooby-Doo \"Scooby-Doo\")_\narrive at Camp Crystal Lake to investigate the Jason Voorhees murders, and are\nkilled off one by one. [Velma](/wiki/Velma_Dinkley \"Velma Dinkley\") is the\nonly survivor, and in typical Scooby-Doo fashion, she rips off Jason's mask to\nreveal his true identity: Old Man Phillips.[133] In episode nineteen, \"[That\nHurts Me](/wiki/That_Hurts_Me \"That Hurts Me\")\", Jason reappears, this time as\na housemate of \"Horror Movie [Big Brother](/wiki/Big_Brother_\\(TV_series\\)\n\"Big Brother \\(TV series\\)\")\", alongside other famous slasher movie killers\nsuch as [Michael Myers](/wiki/Michael_Myers_\\(Halloween\\) \"Michael Myers\n\\(Halloween\\)\"), [Freddy Krueger](/wiki/Freddy_Krueger \"Freddy Krueger\"),\n[Leatherface](/wiki/Leatherface \"Leatherface\"),\n[Pinhead](/wiki/Pinhead_\\(Hellraiser\\) \"Pinhead \\(Hellraiser\\)\"), and\n[Ghostface](/wiki/Ghostface_\\(Scream\\) \"Ghostface \\(Scream\\)\").[134] Three\nyears later, in episode sixty-two, Jason is shown on the days before and after\na typical _Friday the 13th_.[135] Jason is spoofed in the season five episode\nof _[Family Guy](/wiki/Family_Guy \"Family Guy\")_ entitled \"[It Takes a Village\nIdiot, and I Married One](/wiki/It_Takes_a_Village_Idiot,_and_I_Married_One\n\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\")\". The so-called \"Mr. Voorhees\"\nexplains to Asian reporter [Trisha\nTakanawa](/wiki/List_of_Family_Guy_characters#Channel_5_.28WQHG.29 \"List of\nFamily Guy characters\") how happy he is to see local wildlife return following\nthe cleanup and rejuvenation of Lake Quahog. He reappears later in the episode\nas the manager of the \"Britches and Hose\" clothing store. As opposed to his\nmonstrous personality in the films, Jason is depicted here as polite and\narticulate, albeit still a psychopath; he murders random swimmers and\nthreatens to kill his employee if she screws up.[136] In an episode of _[The\nSimpsons](/wiki/The_Simpsons \"The Simpsons\")_ , Jason appears in [a Halloween\nepisode](/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_IX \"Treehouse of Horror IX\") sitting on the\ncouch with Freddy Krueger waiting for the family to arrive. When Freddy asks\nwhere the family is, Jason responds, \"Ehh, whaddya gonna do?\" and turns the TV\non.[137] He also appears in _The Simpsons_ episode \"[Stop, or My Dog Will\nShoot!](/wiki/Stop,_or_My_Dog_Will_Shoot \"Stop, or My Dog Will Shoot\")\",\nalongside [Pinhead](/wiki/Pinhead_\\(Hellraiser\\) \"Pinhead \\(Hellraiser\\)\"),\nmenacing Bart in a fantasy sequence.[138] The _[South Park](/wiki/South_Park\n\"South Park\")_ episodes \"[Imaginationland Episode\nII](/wiki/Imaginationland_Episode_II \"Imaginationland Episode II\")\" and\n\"[III](/wiki/Imaginationland_Episode_III \"Imaginationland Episode III\")\"\nfeature Jason among an assortment of other villains and monsters as an\ninhabitant of the \"bad side\" of Imaginationland, a world populated by\nfictional characters.
