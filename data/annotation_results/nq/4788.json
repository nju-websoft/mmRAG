Awaiting reinforcements, the two Jedi greet a\nshuttle carrying the young Jedi [Ahsoka Tano](/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano \"Ahsoka\nTano\"), who insists that she has been assigned by Jedi Master\n[Yoda](/wiki/Yoda \"Yoda\") to serve as Anakin's Padawan. Anakin begrudgingly\naccepts Ahsoka's apprenticeship, and the two succeed in deactivating the\nSeparatists' energy field while Obi-Wan stalls the droid army commander,\nallowing a Republic victory. Ahsoka earns Anakin's respect.\n\nFollowing the battle, Yoda arrives and informs the Jedi that crime lord [Jabba\nthe Hutt](/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt \"Jabba the Hutt\")'s son Rotta has been\nkidnapped. Anakin and Ahsoka are tasked with retrieving the Huttlet, while\nObi-Wan is sent to [Tatooine](/wiki/Tatooine \"Tatooine\") to negotiate with\nJabba over a potential treaty between the Hutts and the Republic. Anakin and\nAhsoka find Rotta on the planet Teth, where they are ambushed by Separatist\nforces led by [Count Dooku](/wiki/Count_Dooku \"Count Dooku\")'s apprentice\n[Asajj Ventress](/wiki/Asajj_Ventress \"Asajj Ventress\"), discovering that\nDooku hopes to frame the Jedi for Rotta's kidnapping. The Jedi manage to\nescape the trap along with [R2-D2](/wiki/R2-D2 \"R2-D2\") and hijack a derelict\ntransport with which they travel to Tatooine. Obi-Wan, alerted by Anakin,\narrives on Teth and defeats Ventress in a [lightsaber](/wiki/Lightsaber\n\"Lightsaber\") duel, though she manages to escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator [Padmé Amidala](/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala \"Padmé Amidala\"),\nAnakin's secret wife, learns of Anakin's mission and fears for his safety. She\ndecides to contact Jabba's uncle [Ziro](/wiki/Hutt_\\(Star_Wars\\)#Ziro_the_Hutt\n\"Hutt \\(Star Wars\\)\") in Coruscant. The Hutt refuses to cooperate, apparently\nbelieving that it is the Jedi who are responsible for the situation. However,\nPadmé soon discovers that Ziro has actually conspired with Dooku to have Rotta\nkilled in order for Jabba to have Anakin and Ahsoka executed in return, which\nwill force the Jedi Council, led by Yoda, to take Jabba into custody and allow\nZiro to seize power over the Hutt clans. Padmé is discovered and detained, but\na chance call by [C-3PO](/wiki/C-3PO \"C-3PO\") enables her to summon a squadron\nof clone troopers, and Ziro is arrested.\n\nUpon their arrival on Tatooine, Anakin and Ahsoka are shot down by\n[MagnaGuards](/wiki/MagnaGuards \"MagnaGuards\"). Anakin devises a ruse to\nconfront Dooku while carrying a decoy Rotta, leaving Ahsoka to take the real\nRotta to Jabba's palace. While Anakin fights off Dooku, Ahsoka is ambushed by\nthe MagnaGuards, whom she defeats. The two deliver Rotta safely to Jabba, who\nnonetheless orders the Jedi's execution for their supposed attempt to kidnap\nhim. However, Padmé contacts Jabba in time and reveals Ziro and the\nSeparatists' responsibility for the kidnapping. Acknowledging the Jedi's\nheroism and allowing the Republic to have Ziro punished for his betrayal,\nJabba agrees to the Republic treaty while Anakin and Ahsoka are retrieved by\nObi-Wan and Yoda. In the meantime during his escape, Dooku reports to his\nmaster [Darth Sidious](/wiki/Palpatine \"Palpatine\") about the failure of their\nplot against the Jedi and Jabba, but the Sith Lord assures to him that the\ntide of war is still in their favor.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\nMain articles: [List of Star Wars\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_characters \"List of Star Wars characters\")\nand [List of Star Wars: The Clone Wars cast\nmembers](/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_cast_members \"List of Star\nWars: The Clone Wars cast members\")\n\n  * [Matt Lanter](/wiki/Matt_Lanter \"Matt Lanter\") as [Anakin Skywalker](/wiki/Darth_Vader \"Darth Vader\")\n  * [Ashley Eckstein](/wiki/Ashley_Eckstein \"Ashley Eckstein\") as [Ahsoka Tano](/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano \"Ahsoka Tano\")\n  * [James Arnold Taylor](/wiki/James_Arnold_Taylor \"James Arnold Taylor\") as [Obi-Wan Kenobi](/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\"), 4A-7\n  * [Tom Kane](/wiki/Tom_Kane \"Tom Kane\") as [Yoda](/wiki/Yoda \"Yoda\"), Narrator, Admiral Yularen\n  * [Dee Bradley Baker](/wiki/Dee_Bradley_Baker \"Dee Bradley Baker\") as Captain Rex, Commander Cody, [Clone troopers](/wiki/Clone_trooper \"Clone trooper\")\n  * [Christopher Lee](/wiki/Christopher_Lee \"Christopher Lee\") as [Count Dooku / Darth Tyranus](/wiki/Count_Dooku \"Count Dooku\")\n  * [Samuel L.

Essentially, it \"meant using\nlong camera shots, aggressive lighting techniques, and relying on editing\ninstead of storyboards.\"[11] Animators also reviewed designs from the\n[original 2003 _Clone Wars_\nseries](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Clone_Wars_\\(2003_TV_series\\) \"Star Wars: Clone Wars\n\\(2003 TV series\\)\") when creating the animation style for the film and the\nnew series.[14] In charge was Steward Lee, working as the storyboard artist\nduring filming.[8] Some actors from the live-action films, including [Anthony\nDaniels](/wiki/Anthony_Daniels \"Anthony Daniels\"), [Matthew\nWood](/wiki/Matthew_Wood_\\(sound_editor\\) \"Matthew Wood \\(sound editor\\)\"),\n[Christopher Lee](/wiki/Christopher_Lee \"Christopher Lee\") and [Samuel L.\nJackson](/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson \"Samuel L.

The same reviews were re-posted on the site, on the day of the\nfilm's release.

Snider[44]  \n  \nThe main criticism toward the film was the animation. Many criticized it as\ncheap, wooden, non-engaging, and out-of-date;[36][37][39][40][41][45][46] some\nreviewers drew negative comparisons to 1960s [marionette](/wiki/Marionette\n\"Marionette\")-based shows _Thunderbirds_ and _[Fireball\nXL5](/wiki/Fireball_XL5 \"Fireball XL5\")_ ,[39][42][46][47] although George\nLucas previously said the animation style was a deliberate homage to such\nshows.[13] Tom Long of _[The Detroit News](/wiki/The_Detroit_News \"The Detroit\nNews\")_ said the animation \"is downright weak compared to what's generally\nseen on screens these days\"[48] and said the characters are so stiff they look\nlike they were \"carved by [Pinocchio](/wiki/Pinocchio \"Pinocchio\")'s\n[father](/wiki/Mister_Geppetto \"Mister Geppetto\").\"[48] [Roger\nEbert](/wiki/Roger_Ebert \"Roger Ebert\") said \"the characters have hair that\nlooks molded from [Play-Doh](/wiki/Play-Doh \"Play-Doh\"), bodies that seem\narthritic, and moving lips on half-frozen faces—all signs that shortcuts were\ntaken in the animation work.\"[37] McCarthy said \"the movements, both of the\ncharacters and the compositions, look mechanical, and the mostly familiar\ncharacters have all the facial expressiveness of [Easter Island\nstatues](/wiki/Moai \"Moai\").\" But some of the same reviewers who criticized\nthe animation acknowledged some positive elements about it; McCarthy said it\nallowed for \"somewhat more dramatic compositions and color schemes,\"[40] and\nCarrie Rickey, of _The Philadelphia Inquirer_ , said the scenery and\nbackgrounds were \"vivid and alive\",[41] although she said the characters \"move\nas you would imagine the statues at a [waxworks](/wiki/Wax_museum \"Wax\nmuseum\") might.\"[40]\n\nReviewers also criticized the dialogue, which Ebert said was limited to\n\"simplistic declamations\"[37] and Claudia Puig of _[USA Today](/wiki/USA_Today\n\"USA Today\")_ described as \"stilted and overblown, a problem also in some of\nthe live-action incarnations.\"[36] Many critics also said that the battle\nscenes were repetitive and lacked tension;[36][37][40][43][49] McCarthy\ndescribed the action sequences as \"a little exposition, an invasion; some more\nexposition, a lightsaber fight; a bit more blah-blah, a spaceship\n[dogfight](/wiki/Dogfight \"Dogfight\"), and on and on.\"[40] Linda Stasi, of the\n_[New York Post](/wiki/New_York_Post \"New York Post\")_ , also described the\nlack of character development in the film, writing that whereas the original\n_Star Wars_ films dedicated time to allowing viewers to get to know the\ncharacters, \"Director Dave Filoni is so concentrated on the action that we're\nnever given the chance to care who lives and who is blown into spare\nparts.\"[45] Jason Anderson, of the _[Globe and Mail](/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail\n\"The Globe and Mail\")_ , wrote that although _The Clone Wars_ is intended for\nyounger audiences, \"parents may be perturbed by the film's relentless\nviolence.\"[49] Ebert also found protagonist Ahsoka Tano \"annoying,\"[37] and\nMichael Rechtshaffen, of _[The Hollywood\nReporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_ , said the\nattempts of humor amid the bickering between Tano and Anakin Skywalker are\n\"strained\".[46] Puig said she enjoyed the character, and that \"her repartee\nwith Anakin enlivens things.\"[36]\n\n### Box\noffice[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Box office\")]\n\n_The Clone Wars_ earned $68,282,844 worldwide, including $35,161,554 in North\nAmerican domestic box office grosses and $33,121,290 in international\ngrosses.[3] The film earned $14,611,273 on 3,452 screens in its opening\nweekend,[50] including $6,228,973 on its opening day, August 15.[51] It was\nthe third-highest earning film of the weekend, behind _[Tropic\nThunder](/wiki/Tropic_Thunder \"Tropic Thunder\")_ and _[The Dark\nKnight](/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_\\(film\\) \"The Dark Knight \\(film\\)\")_ , which\nearned $25.8 million and $16.3 million, respectively.[50] Dan Fellman, head of\ndistribution for Warner Bros., said the box office performance met\nexpectations because two-thirds of the audience were families and the budget\nfor the film was $8.5 million, frugal considering it was a CGI film, and\nbecause the film was meant to introduce the animated series. Fellman said, \"It\nwas targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons.
