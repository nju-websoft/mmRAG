\"Pop 'til You Drop!\")_, as well as for the\n_[Lilo& Stitch](/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch \"Lilo & Stitch\")_ movie soundtrack,\nwhich was originally scheduled to include several Presley tracks, the A-Teens\npicking it for inclusion in the soundtrack. It was later also featured as a\nbonus track on their third studio album, _[New Arrival](/wiki/New_Arrival \"New\nArrival\")_ for the European market. The video had thus tremendous exposure on\nseveral television channels, with the A-Teens eventually including the song in\ntheir third album. As a result, the song had two music videos, one to promote\nthe Disney movie, the other for the album. It is also shown in the teen pop\ncompilation album, _[Disney Girlz Rock](/wiki/Disney_Girlz_Rock \"Disney Girlz\nRock\")_.\n\nThe song did not chart in the United States but reached No. 12 in\n[Sweden](/wiki/Sweden \"Sweden\"), No. 16 in [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina\n\"Argentina\"), and No. 41 in [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"). Despite\nthe success of the song overseas, it failed to attract the rest of the [Latin\nAmerican](/wiki/Latin_American \"Latin American\") public, due to the fact that\nthere was a [Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_language \"Spanish language\") version of\nthe song, performed by the [Argentine](/wiki/Argentina \"Argentina\") group,\n[Bandana](/wiki/Bandana_\\(pop_group\\) \"Bandana \\(pop group\\)\"). In addition,\nthe A-Teens' version of the song was overshadowed by the promotion of\nBandana's version.\n\n### Music\nvideo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Can%27t_Help_Falling_in_Love&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Music video\")]\n\nThe video was directed by [Gregory Dark](/wiki/Gregory_Dark \"Gregory Dark\")\nand filmed in [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\"),\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\").
