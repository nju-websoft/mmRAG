Canonical stated their intention for\nthis application to replace Add/Remove Programs (gnome-app-install) in 9.10\nand possibly Synaptic, Software Sources, Gdebi and Update Manager in Ubuntu\n10.04.[92] Karmic Koala also includes a slideshow during the installation\nprocess (through ubiquity-slideshow) that highlights applications and features\nin Ubuntu.\n\n### Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid\nLynx)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ubuntu_version_history&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS \\(Lucid Lynx\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Ubuntu_10.04_screenshot.png/220px-\nUbuntu_10.04_screenshot.png)](/wiki/File:Ubuntu_10.04_screenshot.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ubuntu_10.04_screenshot.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nUbuntu 10.04 (_Lucid Lynx_)\n\nShuttleworth first announced Ubuntu 10.04 (_Lucid Lynx_)[9] on 19 September\n2009 at the Atlanta Linux Fest; Canonical released it on 29 April\n2010.[93][94] It is Canonical's 12th release of Ubuntu and the third Long Term\nSupport (LTS) release. Canonical provided support for the desktop version of\nUbuntu 10.04 until 9 May 2013 and the server version until 30 April 2015.[95]\n\nThe new release includes, among other things, improved support for\n[Nvidia](/wiki/Nvidia \"Nvidia\") proprietary graphics drivers, while switching\nto the open source Nvidia graphics driver,\n[Nouveau](/wiki/Nouveau_\\(graphics\\) \"Nouveau \\(graphics\\)\"), by default.\n[Plymouth](/wiki/Plymouth_\\(software\\) \"Plymouth \\(software\\)\") was also\nintroduced allowing boot animations.[96][97][98]\n\n[GIMP](/wiki/GIMP \"GIMP\") was removed from the Lucid installation CD due to\nits professional-grade complexity and its file size. [F-Spot](/wiki/F-Spot\n\"F-Spot\") provides normal user-level graphics-editing capabilities and GIMP\nremains available for download in the repositories.[99]\n\nThe distribution emphasizes the new importance of web services and [social\nnetworking](/wiki/Social_networking \"Social networking\") with integrated\ninterfaces for posting to sites like Facebook and Twitter, complementing the\nIM and email integration already in Ubuntu.\n\nOn 4 March 2010, it was announced that Lucid Lynx would feature a new theme,\nincluding new logos, taking Ubuntu's new visual style[100] into account:\n\n> The new style in Ubuntu is inspired by the idea of \"Light\".\n>\n> We're drawn to Light because it denotes both warmth and clarity, and\n> intrigued by the idea that \"light\" is a good value in software. Good\n> software is \"light\" in the sense that it uses your resources efficiently,\n> runs quickly, and can easily be reshaped as needed. Ubuntu represents a\n> break with the bloatware of proprietary operating systems and an opportunity\n> to delight to those who use computers for work and play. More and more of\n> our communications are powered by light, and in future, our processing power\n> will depend on our ability to work with light, too.\n>\n> Visually, light is beautiful, light is ethereal, light brings clarity and\n> comfort.\n>\n> Historical perspective: From 2004–2010, the theme in Ubuntu was \"Human\". Our\n> tagline was \"Linux for Human Beings\" and we used a palette reflective of the\n> full range of humanity. Our focus as a project was bringing Linux from the\n> data center into the lives of our friends and global family.\n\nCritical responses to the new theme have been mixed. [Ars\nTechnica](/wiki/Ars_Technica \"Ars Technica\")'s Ryan Paul said \"The new themes\nand updated color palette are nice improvement for Ubuntu... After testing the\nnew theme for several hours, I feel like it's a step forward, but it still\nfalls a bit short of my expectations.\" Paul also noted that the most\ncontroversial aspect of the new design amongst users has been the placement of\nthe window control buttons on the left instead of the right side of the\nwindows.[101][102] TechSource's Jun Auza expressed concern that the new theme\nis too close to that used by [Apple's](/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\") [Mac OS\nX](/wiki/Mac_OS_X \"Mac OS X\"): \"I think Ubuntu is having an identity crisis\nright now and should seriously consider changing several things in terms of\nlook and feel to avoid being branded as a Mac OS X rip-off, or worse, get sued\nby Apple.\" Auza also summarized Ubuntu user feedback: \"I believe the fans are\ndivided right now.

The move to Unity was\ncontroversial as some [GNOME](/wiki/GNOME \"GNOME\") developers feared it would\nfracture the community and marginalize GNOME Shell.[118][119] The\n[GNOME](/wiki/GNOME \"GNOME\") desktop environment is still available in Ubuntu\n11.04 under the title Ubuntu Classic as a fallback to Unity.\n\nUbuntu 11.04 employed [Banshee](/wiki/Banshee_\\(media_player\\) \"Banshee\n\\(media player\\)\") as the default music player, replacing\n[Rhythmbox](/wiki/Rhythmbox \"Rhythmbox\"). Other new applications included\n[Mozilla Firefox 4](/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox_4 \"Mozilla Firefox 4\") and\n[LibreOffice](/wiki/LibreOffice \"LibreOffice\"), which replaced\n[OpenOffice.org](/wiki/OpenOffice.org \"OpenOffice.org\").[120][121][122] The\n[OpenStack](/wiki/OpenStack \"OpenStack\") cloud computing platform was added in\nthis release.[123][124]\n\nStarting with Ubuntu 11.04, the [Ubuntu Netbook\nEdition](/wiki/Ubuntu_Netbook_Edition \"Ubuntu Netbook Edition\") was merged\ninto the desktop edition.[125]\n\nIn reviewing Ubuntu 11.04 upon its stable release, Ryan Paul of [Ars\nTechnica](/wiki/Ars_Technica \"Ars Technica\") said \"There is a lot to like in\nUbuntu 11.04, but also a lot of room for improvement.\" Jesse Smith of\n[Distrowatch](/wiki/Distrowatch \"Distrowatch\") said \"I'm of the opinion there\nare good features in this release, but 11.04 definitely suffered from being\nrushed out the door while it was still beta quality.

He explained that Oneiric means \"dreamy\".[129] Ubuntu 11.10\nwas released on schedule on 13 October 2011 and is Canonical's 15th release of\nUbuntu.[130]\n\nIn April 2011 Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu 11.10 would not include the\nclassic [GNOME](/wiki/GNOME \"GNOME\") desktop as a fall back to Unity, unlike\nUbuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal. Instead, 11.10 included a 2D version of Unity as a\nfallback for computers that lacked the hardware resources for the\n[Compiz](/wiki/Compiz \"Compiz\")-based 3D version. However, the classic GNOME\ndesktop remained available in Ubuntu 11.10 through a package in the Ubuntu\nrepositories.[131] Shuttleworth also confirmed that Unity in Ubuntu 11.10\nwould run as a shell for GNOME 3 on top of GNOME 3 libraries, unlike in Ubuntu\n11.04 where it ran as a shell for GNOME 2. Moreover, users were able to\ninstall the entire GNOME 3 stack along with [GNOME Shell](/wiki/GNOME_Shell\n\"GNOME Shell\") directly from the Ubuntu repositories; to be presented with a\n\"GNOME 3 desktop\" choice at login.[132] During the development cycle there\nwere many changes to Unity, including the placement of the Ubuntu button on\nthe Launcher instead of on the Panel, the autohiding of the window controls\n(and the global menu) of maximized windows, the introduction of more\n[transparency](/wiki/Alpha_compositing \"Alpha compositing\") into the\n[Dash](/wiki/Unity_\\(user_interface\\)#Features \"Unity \\(user interface\\)\")\n(and the Panel when the Dash was opened) and the introduction of window\ncontrols for the Dash.[133]\n\nIn May 2011, it was announced that [PiTiVi](/wiki/PiTiVi \"PiTiVi\") would be no\nlonger part of the Ubuntu ISO, starting with Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot. The\nreasons given for removing it included poor user reception, lack of fit with\nthe default user-case for Ubuntu, lack of polish and the application's lack of\ndevelopment maturity. PiTiVi will not be replaced on the ISO with another\nvideo editor. Other changes include removing Computer Janitor, as it caused\nbroken systems for users, and the removal of the\n[Synaptic](/wiki/Synaptic_\\(software\\) \"Synaptic \\(software\\)\") package\nmanager, which can optionally be installed via the [Ubuntu Software\nCenter](/wiki/Ubuntu_Software_Center \"Ubuntu Software Center\").

This release also switched the default media player from\n[Banshee](/wiki/Banshee_\\(media_player\\) \"Banshee \\(media player\\)\") back to\n[Rhythmbox](/wiki/Rhythmbox \"Rhythmbox\") and dropped the Tomboy note-taking\napplication and the supporting [Mono](/wiki/Mono_\\(software\\) \"Mono\n\\(software\\)\") framework as well.[144][145] Also, the window dodge feature has\nbeen removed from the Unity launcher starting with Ubuntu 12.04.[146]\n\nUbuntu 12.04 incorporated a new [head-up display](/wiki/Head-up_display \"Head-\nup display\") (HUD) feature that allows [hotkey](/wiki/Hotkey \"Hotkey\")\nsearching for application menu items from the keyboard, without needing the\nmouse. Shuttleworth said that the HUD \"will ultimately replace menus in Unity\napplications\" but for Ubuntu 12.04 at least the menus will remain.[147]\n\nUbuntu 12.04 is the first Ubuntu release shipped with [IPv6](/wiki/IPv6\n\"IPv6\") [privacy extensions](/wiki/IPv6#Privacy \"IPv6\") turned on by default.\nUbuntu 11.10 already supported IPv6 on the desktop and in the installer\n([stateless address\nautoconfiguration](/wiki/IPv6_stateless_address_autoconfiguration \"IPv6\nstateless address autoconfiguration\") SLAAC, stateless [DHCPv6](/wiki/DHCPv6\n\"DHCPv6\") and stateful DHCPv6).[148]\n\nLike other LTS releases, 12.04 included [point releases](/wiki/Point_release\n\"Point release\") that bundled updates to shorten downloads for users\ninstalling the release later in its lifecycle. The point releases and dates\nwere: 12.04.1 (23 August 2012), 12.04.2 (14 February 2013), 12.04.3 (scheduled\nfor release on 22 August 2013, but actually released on 23 August 2013) and\n12.04.4 (6 February 2014).[149] The last point release was 12.04.5, released\non 7 August 2014.[150]\n\nJesse Smith of [DistroWatch](/wiki/DistroWatch \"DistroWatch\") said that many\npeople, like he, had questioned Ubuntu's direction, including Unity. But with\nUbuntu 12.04 he felt that the puzzle pieces, which individually may have been\nunderwhelming, had come together to form a whole, clear picture. He said\n\"Unity, though a step away from the traditional desktop, has several features\nwhich make it attractive, such as reducing mouse travel. The HUD means that\nnewcomers can find application functionality with a quick search and more\nadvanced users can use the HUD to quickly run menu commands from the\nkeyboard.\" He wrote that Unity had grown to maturity, while indicating that he\nwas bothered by its lack of flexibility. He did notice issues, however,\nespecially that the HUD did not work in LibreOffice and performance in a\nvirtual machine was unsatisfactory. He concluded that Ubuntu's overall\nexperience was \"head and shoulders above anything else in the Linux\necosystem.\"[151]\n\nJim Lynch wrote \"Ubuntu 12.04 is definitely worth an upgrade if you're running\nan earlier version. Unity is finally coming into its own in this release, plus\nthere are other enhancements that make upgrading worthwhile. Ubuntu is getting\nbetter and better with each release. I was one of the Unity skeptics\ninitially, but I've come to accept it as part of Ubuntu.\"[152]\n\nJack Wallen of [TechRepublic](/wiki/TechRepublic \"TechRepublic\") – who had\nstrongly criticized early versions of Unity – said \"Since Ubuntu 12.04 was\nreleased, and I migrated over from Linux Mint, I'm working much more\nefficiently.

[...] I realize that many people out there have\nspurned Unity (I was one of them for a long time), but the more I use it, the\nmore I realize that Canonical really did their homework on how to help end\nusers more efficiently interact with their computers.

As this will be the first of a series of three releases\nbefore the next LTS release, Shuttleworth indicated that it will include a\nrefreshed look, with work to be done on typography and iconography. The\nrelease takes its name from the [quetzal](/wiki/Quetzal \"Quetzal\"), a species\nof Central American birds.[154] Ubuntu 12.10 was released on schedule on 18\nOctober 2012 and is Canonical's seventeenth release of the operating\nsystem.[155]\n\nRyan Paul, writing for [Ars Technica](/wiki/Ars_Technica \"Ars Technica\"), said\nin April 2012 when the name was announced \"A Quetzal is a colorful bird that\nis common to Central America. The most well-known variety, the resplendent\nquetzal, is known for its beauty. The name is a good fit for Ubuntu, which\naims to soar in the cloud, offer visual appeal without compromising function,\nand avoid smacking into closed windows.\"[156]\n\nThe Ubuntu Developer Summit held in May 2012 set the priorities for this\nrelease. They are forecast to include an improved boot up sequence and log-in\nscreen, dropping Unity 2D in favor of lower hardware requirements for Unity\n3D, wrap around dialogs and toolbars for the [HUD](/wiki/Head-up_display\n\"Head-up display\") and a \"[vanilla](/wiki/Vanilla_\\(software\\) \"Vanilla\n\\(software\\)\")\" version of Gnome-Shell as an option. The release would likely\ninclude GNOME 3.6, Python 3 and the 3.5 Linux kernel.[157] It would ship with\n[Python 3](/wiki/Python_\\(programming_language\\) \"Python \\(programming\nlanguage\\)\") in the image, but with Python 2 available in the repositories,\nvia the \"python\" package.[158] The kernel will have the\n[PAE](/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension \"Physical Address Extension\") switched\non by default.[159]\n\nIn July 2012, development versions of Ubuntu 12.10 received a new combined\nuser, session and system menu.[160] This release also included [Ubuntu Web\nApps](/wiki/Ubuntu_Web_Apps \"Ubuntu Web Apps\"), a means of running web\napplications directly from the desktop, without having to open a browser.[161]\nIt would use [Nautilus](/wiki/Nautilus_\\(file_manager\\) \"Nautilus \\(file\nmanager\\)\") 3.4 as its file manager, in place of the 3.5 and newer versions,\nto retain features deleted from later versions.[162]\n\nIn September 2012, Canonical's Kate Stewart announced that the Ubuntu 12.10\nimage would not fit on a compact disc, saying \"There is no longer a\ntraditional CD sized image, DVD or alternate image, but rather a single 800MB\nUbuntu image that can be used from USB or DVD.\"[163] However, a third-party\nproject has created a version of Ubuntu 12.10 that fits on a CD. It uses\n[LZMA2](/wiki/LZMA2 \"LZMA2\") compression instead of the\n[DEFLATE](/wiki/DEFLATE \"DEFLATE\") compression used on the official Ubuntu DVD\nimage.[164]\n\nAlso in late September 2012, it was announced that the version of Unity to be\nshipped with Ubuntu 12.10 would by default include searches of\n[Amazon.com](/wiki/Amazon.com \"Amazon.com\") for searched terms. This move\ncaused immediate controversy among Ubuntu users, particularly with regard to\nprivacy issues, and caused Mark Shuttleworth to issue a statement indicating\nthat this feature is not [adware](/wiki/Adware \"Adware\") and labelled many of\nthe objections \"FUD\" ([Fear, uncertainty and\ndoubt](/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt \"Fear, uncertainty and doubt\")).\nShuttleworth stated \"What we have in 12.10 isn't the full experience, so those\nwho leap to judgement are at maximum risk of having to eat their words later.\nChill out. If the first cut doesn't work for you, remove it, or just search\nthe specific scope you want (there are hotkeys for all the local scopes).\"\nRegardless, users filed a [Launchpad](/wiki/Launchpad_\\(website\\) \"Launchpad\n\\(website\\)\") bug report on the feature requesting that it be made a separate\nlens and not included with general desktop searches for files, directories and\napplications. The degree of community push-back on the issue resulted in plans\nby the developers to make the dash and where it searches user-configurable via\na GUI-setting dialogue. Despite concerns that the setting dialogue would not\nmake the final version of Ubuntu 12.10, it was completed and is present in the\nfinal version of 12.10.[165][166][167][168][169][170]\n\nIn the week prior to the stable release of Ubuntu 12.10 data-privacy advocate\nLuís de Sousa indicated that the inclusion of the shopping lens, installed\nwithout explicit permission of the user, violates [European Directive\n95/46/EC](/wiki/European_Directive_95/46/EC \"European Directive 95/46/EC\") on\ndata privacy. That directive requires that the \"data subject has unambiguously\ngiven his consent\" in situations where personal identifying information is\nsent.[171]\n\nIn reviewing Ubuntu 12.10 at the end of October 2012 for\n[DistroWatch](/wiki/DistroWatch \"DistroWatch\"), Jesse Smith raised concerns\nabout the Amazon shopping lens, saying, \"it has raised a number of privacy\nconcerns in the community and, looking over Ubuntu's legal notice about\nprivacy does not provide any reassurance. The notice informs us Canonical\nreserves the right to share our keystrokes, search terms and IP address with a\nnumber of third parties, including Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and the BBC. This\nfeature is enabled by default, but can be turned off through the\ndistribution's settings panel.\" He also found that the dash provided very slow\nperformance and that the release was \"practically unusable in the VirtualBox\nenvironment\". He summed up his experiences, \"After a day and a half of using\nUbuntu 12.10 it was an internal struggle not to wipe my hard drive and just\nfind another distribution to review. During the first twenty-four hours Ubuntu\nspied on me, provided performance which was distinctly sub par, the interface\nregularly popped up errors (sometimes so frequently the first pop-up wouldn't\nhave faded out of view before the next one appeared), the update notification\ndidn't work and it wasn't possible to turn off accessibility features through\nthe graphical interface. Adding insult to injury, the Unity dash kept locking\nup or losing focus while I was trying to use it and the operating system\ncrashed more times than not while trying to shutdown or logout. Switching away\nfrom Unity to GNOME Fallback helped the performance issues I had experienced\nwith the Dash, but it didn't remove the annoying pop-up errors and performance\n(while usable) still wasn't as good as I would expect. And what really makes\nme scratch my head is Ubuntu 12.04 worked really well on this same\nhardware.\"[172]\n\nIn early November, the [Electronic Frontier\nFoundation](/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation \"Electronic Frontier\nFoundation\") made a statement on the shopping lens issue, \"Technically, when\nyou search for something in Dash, your computer makes a secure HTTPS\nconnection to productsearch.ubuntu.com, sending along your search query and\nyour IP address.

Sometimes service\nmanagers stop working properly and network device names usually change.

Other improvements\ninclude a new version of Ubuntu Software that supports faster loading, better\nsupport for installing command-line-only non-GUI applications, support for\ninstalling fonts and multimedia codecs and introduction of paid\napplications.[257] It is based on Linux kernel version 4.8.[258]\n\nThis version of Ubuntu introduced only minor incremental changes. These\nincluded [LibreOffice](/wiki/LibreOffice \"LibreOffice\") 5.2, [GTK3](/wiki/GTK3\n\"GTK3\") version by default, the Update Manager shows\n[changelog](/wiki/Changelog \"Changelog\") entries for [Personal Package\nArchives](/wiki/Personal_Package_Archive \"Personal Package Archive\") (PPAs) as\nwell as repository software, [GNOME](/wiki/GNOME \"GNOME\") applications updated\nto version 3.20, with some using version 3.22. Also [systemd](/wiki/Systemd\n\"Systemd\") now handles user sessions as well as the previously implemented\nsystem sessions.[258]\n\nJoey Sneddon of OMG Ubuntu said, \"Ubuntu 16.10 is not a big update over Ubuntu\n16.04 LTS, released back in April. If you were hoping it'd be a compelling or\nmust-have upgrade you'll be sadly disappointed.\" He did find some\nimprovements, \"The Ubuntu Software app is also significantly faster in use.\nThis solves a real pet peeve of mine on the incumbent LTS desktop. Thankfully,\nYakkety makes it quicker to find, browser, search and install applications,\"\nbut concluded, \"Ubuntu 16.10 is not a must-have upgrade—not for most\npeople.\"[259]\n\nMarius Nestor of [Softpedia](/wiki/Softpedia \"Softpedia\") noted, \"Ubuntu 16.10\nis not an exciting release for fans of the open source operating system.\nProbably the most important feature of Yakkety Yak is Linux kernel 4.8, which\nbrings support for the latest hardware, but other than that, you'll get some\nupdated components that are mostly based on the old GNOME 3.20 Stack.\"[260]\n\nWriting in _Makeuseof_ , Bertel King, Jr. said, \"If you're feeling\nunderwhelmed, you probably remember the Ubuntu of yesteryear. Back in the days\nof 8.10, 9.04, and 10.04 each release brought forth a new theme or ambitious\nfeature. Unity first appeared in 10.10 as a netbook interface before replacing\nthe regular desktop in 11.04. By comparison, modern Ubuntu updates feel\nrelatively stagnant. You would be forgiven for not being able to distinguish\nbetween 12.04 and 16.10.\"[261]\n\n### Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty\nZapus)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ubuntu_version_history&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Ubuntu 17.04 \\(Zesty Zapus\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Ubuntu_17.04_ukr.png/220px-\nUbuntu_17.04_ukr.png)](/wiki/File:Ubuntu_17.04_ukr.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ubuntu_17.04_ukr.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nUbuntu 17.04 _Zesty Zapus_\n\nOn 17 October 2016, Mark Shuttleworth announced that the codename of Ubuntu\n17.04, released on 13 April 2017, would be _Zesty Zapus_.[262]\n\nThis release dropped support for the 32-bit [PowerPC](/wiki/PowerPC \"PowerPC\")\narchitecture, following the same move by the upstream [Debian](/wiki/Debian\n\"Debian\") project. Other changes include the default DNS resolver now being\n_systemd-resolved_ , Linux kernel 4.10, and support for printers which allow\nprinting without printer-specific drivers.[263][264][265]\n\nJoey Sneddon of _OMG Ubuntu_ said of this release, \"this is no normal release\nof Ubuntu. It's potentially the last version of the distribution that will\ncome with the Unity 7 desktop by default. That's not a certainty, of course,\nbut we know that Ubuntu will switch to GNOME for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS next year.\nIt's reasonable to expect developers to want to kick a few tyres on that\nswitch ahead of time, in the next interim release. A bittersweet release then,\nUbuntu 17.04 sees the distro reach the end of the alphabet in codenames, and\nthe end of an era in everything else. Sadly there's not an awful lot to say.\nUnity is, by and large, the same as it is in the 16.04 LTS....Ubuntu 17.04 is\nan iterative update with modest appeal. While there is little compelling\nreason for anyone running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to upgrade (especially for those\nwho opt receive the newer hardware enablement stack) it's not an irrelevant\nrelease. Ubuntu 16.10 users will want to upgrade to Ubuntu 17.04 for the\ngeneral around improvements, access to newer apps, and because the truncated\nsupport period of these short term releases necessitates it.\"[264]\n\nMaruis Nestor of [Softpedia](/wiki/Softpedia \"Softpedia\") called it, \"a\npowerful release, both inside and outside\" and noted, \"the default desktop\nenvironment remains Unity 7, so your beloved Ubuntu desktop environment is not\ngoing anyway at the moment. It will also be available in the upcoming Ubuntu\n17.10 release, whose development will start next month. After that, starting\nwith Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, the GNOME desktop will be used by default.\"[265]\n\n### Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful\nAardvark)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ubuntu_version_history&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Ubuntu 17.10 \\(Artful Aardvark\\)\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Ubuntu-17.10-ca.png/220px-\nUbuntu-17.10-ca.png)](/wiki/File:Ubuntu-17.10-ca.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ubuntu-17.10-ca.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nUbuntu 17.10 _Artful Aardvark_\n\nThe name of this release, Artful Aardvark, was announced via\n[Launchpad](/wiki/Launchpad_\\(website\\) \"Launchpad \\(website\\)\") on 21 April\n2017, instead of on Shuttleworth's blog as has been the case in the past.

Watson of [ZDNet](/wiki/ZDNet \"ZDNet\") said, \"I have not been much\nof an Ubuntu fan for a long time now, but this release includes a lot of\nsignificant changes, many of which might address some of my most serious\nobjections about Ubuntu. So I think I should take a closer look at it than I\nnormally do.\" He noted on printer configuration, \"I got a notice that our\nwireless printer had been successfully configured. I hadn't even thought about\ntrying to set up a printer yet, so that was a very nice surprise - and a good\nthing to point out to those who are still going around spouting 5+ years out\nof date
