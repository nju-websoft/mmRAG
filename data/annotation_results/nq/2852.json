These sets are essentially a reduced\nversion of the regular issue proof sets and the packaging maintained the same\nblue color scheme, but came in a smaller box and different [certificate of\nauthenticity](/wiki/Certificate_of_authenticity \"Certificate of\nauthenticity\"). This collection ceased with the resolution of the program in\n2008. These sets are usually denoted as the _5-piece_ sets from a given year.\nAll issues were produced at the [San Francisco Mint](/wiki/San_Francisco_Mint\n\"San Francisco Mint\").\n\n## United States Mint 50 State Quarters Silver Proof\nSet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: United States Mint 50 State Quarters Silver Proof Set\")]\n\nThe 50 State Quarters Proof Sets produced with the five quarters produced that\nyear in 90% [silver](/wiki/Silver \"Silver\") and again were the same as the\nyear's Silver Proof Set but in a reduced red packaging and unique certificate\nof authenticity. All issues were produced at the [San Francisco\nMint](/wiki/San_Francisco_Mint \"San Francisco Mint\").\n\n## United States Mint America the Beautiful Quarters Proof\nSet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: United States Mint America the Beautiful Quarters Proof Set\")]\n\nThe [America the Beautiful Quarters](/wiki/America_the_Beautiful_Quarters\n\"America the Beautiful Quarters\") program began in 2010 as a continuation of\nthe 50 State Quarters and D.C. and Territories programs, allowing each state a\nrepresentation in the nation's coinage. These sets are reduced versions of the\nUnited States Mint Proof Set and the packaging maintains the same burnt-orange\ncolor scheme, but came in a smaller box and different certificate of\nauthenticity. All issues were produced at the [San Francisco\nMint](/wiki/San_Francisco_Mint \"San Francisco Mint\").\n\n## United States Mint America the Beautiful Quarters Silver Proof\nSet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: United States Mint America the Beautiful Quarters Silver Proof\nSet\")]\n\nThe 50 State Quarters Proof Sets are also produced in 90%\n[silver](/wiki/Silver \"Silver\") and again are the same as the year's Silver\nProof Set but in a reduced navy-blue packaging and unique certificate of\nauthenticity. All issues were produced at the [San Francisco\nMint](/wiki/San_Francisco_Mint \"San Francisco Mint\").\n\n## United States Mint District of Columbia & U.S. Territories Quarters Proof\nSet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: United States Mint District of Columbia & U.S. Territories\nQuarters Proof Set\")]\n\nUpon completion of the 50 State Quarters Program, it was decided to honor\n[Washington D.C.](/wiki/Washington_D.C. \"Washington D.C.\") and the [U.S.\nOverseas Territories](/wiki/Insular_area \"Insular area\") in a similar manner.\nThe [District of Columbia and United States Territories\nQuarters](/wiki/District_of_Columbia_and_United_States_Territories_Quarters\n\"District of Columbia and United States Territories Quarters\") allowed for the\nminting of six designs in 2009 and these were sold as a set. All were produced\nat the San Francisco Mint.\n\n## United States Mint Presidential $1 Coin Proof\nSet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: United States Mint Presidential $1 Coin Proof Set\")]\n\nWith the launch of the [Presidential $1 Coin\nProgram](/wiki/Presidential_$1_Coin_Program \"Presidential $1 Coin Program\"),\nfour [dollar coins](/wiki/Dollar_coin_\\(United_States\\) \"Dollar coin \\(United\nStates\\)\") have been released each year since 2007 - each depicting a serving\n[U.S. President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\"). This set is the sleeve of dollar coins from regular issue mint sets\non its own with reduced packaging and a different certificate of authenticity.\nThe program is scheduled to go until 2016 when all currently eligible\npresidents have been honored.\n\n## United States Prestige Coin\nSet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: United States Prestige Coin Set\")]\n\nFirst released in 1983 and continued through 1997 missing only one year\n(1985), Prestige Sets contain proof strikings of the regular issue coinage in\naddition to the [commemorative dollar and half dollar from the year of\nrelease](/wiki/Modern_United_States_commemorative_coins \"Modern United States\ncommemorative coins\"). The coins are presented in a book-like case with a\nspecial laminated enclosure of a different design than the standard proof set\nsleeves. This collection was marketed to give consumers a more \"premium\"\noption.\n\n## United States Mint Proof\nSet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: United States Mint Proof Set\")]\n\nThis collection encompasses every coin design produced by the United States\nMint in a single year. This is the longest-running series of coins produced by\nthe Mint and comprises coins prepared using [proof\nstriking](/wiki/Proof_coinage \"Proof coinage\") methods.[1] The Mint packages\nthe specially prepared coins in hard plastic cases meant for long-term\npreservation.\n\nAll releases from 1936 to 1972 included the [cent](/wiki/Cent_\\(U.S._coin\\)\n\"Cent \\(U.S. coin\\)\"), [nickel](/wiki/Nickel_\\(U.S._coin\\) \"Nickel \\(U.S.\ncoin\\)\"), [dime](/wiki/Dime_\\(U.S._coin\\) \"Dime \\(U.S. coin\\)\"),\n[quarter](/wiki/Quarter_\\(U.S._coin\\) \"Quarter \\(U.S. coin\\)\"), and [half\ndollar](/wiki/Half_dollar_\\(U.S._coin\\) \"Half dollar \\(U.S. coin\\)\") from that\nyear. The first proof sets through 1964 were minted at the [Philadelphia\nMint](/wiki/Philadelphia_Mint \"Philadelphia Mint\"). There were two official\nreleases in 1942: one regular five coin set and a set including a [silver\nwartime nickel](/wiki/Nickel_\\(U.S._coin\\)#Wartime_nickels \"Nickel \\(U.S.\ncoin\\)\"). United States currency was debased beginning in 1965, but the sets\ncontinued under the name United States Mint Proof Set.Production was moved to\nthe San Francisco branch in 1968, and all subsequent issues bear coins with an\n\"S\" mint mark. In 1973, the [Eisenhower dollar](/wiki/Eisenhower_dollar\n\"Eisenhower dollar\") was added to the collection. Sets from 1975 will have a\n[dual-date 1776-1976 quarter, half-dollar, and\ndollar](/wiki/United_States_Bicentennial_coinage \"United States Bicentennial\ncoinage\") as none of those coins were ever produced with a 1975 date. The\n[Susan B. Anthony dollar](/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony_dollar \"Susan B. Anthony\ndollar\") replaced the Eisenhower in 1979. The 1981 mint sets were the only\nmethod of obtaining a Susan B. from that year, though many have slipped into\ncirculation. With the cease in minting of dollar coins, the regular issue\nProof Set for 1982 included a brass token. From 1983 until 1998, the annual\nUnited States Proof set resumed to only issuing the penny, nickel, dime,\nquarter, and half-dollar.\n\nWith the introduction of the [50 State Quarters](/wiki/50_State_Quarters \"50\nState Quarters\") program in 1999, the Mint began issuing all five quarters\nreleased from that year with the already established denominations, thus\ncreating a nine-coin set split across two holders, or lenses. The single lens\ncontaining just the quarters was also sold separately. The following year, the\nSacagawea dollar was included in the regular set, bringing the coin count to\nten. The Westward Journey Series of nickels saw the introduction of eleven\ncoin sets in 2004 and 2005 featuring both nickels, the penny, dime, half\ndollar, golden dollar and all five quarters. The regular issue returned to ten\ncoins in 2006, but the [Presidential Dollar Coin\nProgram](/wiki/Presidential_Dollar_Coin_Program \"Presidential Dollar Coin\nProgram\") necessitated an expansion to three lenses with a total of fourteen\ncoins from 2007 to 2008. In 2009, another lens was added to facilitate the\npennies minted for the Lincoln Bicentennial collection. The pennies produced\nfor the proof sets that year were special in that their composition saw a\nreturn to the 95% [copper](/wiki/Copper \"Copper\") alloy employed when the\nLincoln cent was first introduced. This set peaked the coin count at eighteen\nas it also included that year's set of [District of Columbia and United States\nTerritories\nQuarters](/wiki/District_of_Columbia_and_United_States_Territories_Quarters\n\"District of Columbia and United States Territories Quarters\"). The regular\nrelease returned to a count of fourteen coins across three lenses in 2010 and\nthe individual lens of [America the Beautiful\nQuarters](/wiki/America_the_Beautiful_Quarters \"America the Beautiful\nQuarters\") or Presidential Dollar Coins sold separate.\n\n## United States Mint Silver Proof\nSet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: United States Mint Silver Proof Set\")]\n\nBeginning in 1992, the Mint began producing proof sets with the\n[cupronickel](/wiki/Cupronickel \"Cupronickel\") denomination replaced by\nspecimens struck with the pre-debasement composition: coin silver, or 90%\n[Ag](/wiki/Silver \"Silver\") and 10% [Cu](/wiki/Copper \"Copper\").[2] All of the\nquarters released in any one year of a series since 1999 are also struck in\nsilver.[3] Otherwise, these sets are largely similar to the standard United\nStates Mint Proof Set, but are packaged with a red color scheme and different\ncertificate of authenticity.\n\n## United States Mint Uncirculated Coin\nSet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: United States Mint Uncirculated Coin Set\")]\n\nThe Uncirculated Sets, or Mint Sets, contain specimens of coins that are\ntypically minted for general circulation. The first such sets were sold in\n1947 in cardboard panels with two coins for each issue, thus showing the\nobverse and reverse of each one. Such sets were, with the exception of 1950,\nannually produced through 1958. In 1959 a plastic soft pack of single coins\nwas sold and these were annually offered through 1964. In 1965-7 \"special mint\nsets\", a higher level of uncirculated coins, replaced both mint and proof\nsets. With the exception of 1982-1983, mint sets have been issued every year\nsince 1968. (For 1982 and 1983 collectors sometimes buy the annual \"souvenir\nsets\" struck by the Philadelphia and Denver mints, which are very similar to\nthe official Treasury-issued mint sets.[4])\n\nNotable are the 1970, 1973, and 1996 mint sets. These contained the 1970-D\nKennedy half dollar, the 1973-P and 1973-D Eisenhower dollars, and the 1996-W\nRoosevelt dime, none of which were minted for general circulation and could be\nobtained only from the U.S. mint sets. More recent sets contain non-\ncirculating half-dollar and dollar denominations. From the 2005 mint set coins\nthrough the 2010 mint set coins were prepared using special dies that produce\na \"satin finish\" distinct from business strike coins. The US Mint reverted to\ncoins that are typically minted for general circulation in 2011. Mint sets\ncurrently are sealed in a plastic blister-pack, unlike the flexible plastic\npacks of earlier sets.[5] They are usually sold in sets of two - one for each\nbranch of production.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Mint_coin_sets&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [_2011 United States Mint Proof Set Certificate of Authenticity_](http://www.usmint.gov).
