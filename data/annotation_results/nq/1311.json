Big Sean drops a rap exalting a lady love, too.\n\"I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah/ Give me a time\nand a place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it,\" Sean raps.[17]\n\n## Critical\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=As_Long_as_You_Love_Me_\\(Justin_Bieber_song\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Critical reception\")]\n\nJon Caramanica of _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York\nTimes\")_ described the song as \"a dubstep love song, with Mr. Bieber reaching\ninto falsetto at points without losing power, and showing restraint at the\nchorus.\"[2] Natalie Shaw of [BBC Music](/wiki/BBC_Music \"BBC Music\") wrote,\n\"It's fine that his vocal simpers on the verses of As Long As You Love Me,\nbecause the song's pulsating undercurrent propels it onto the dancefloor.\"[19]\nHermione Hoby of _[The Observer](/wiki/The_Observer \"The Observer\")_\ncomplimented his vocals, calling \"plaintive and still unmistakably\nteenage.\"[20] Jason Lipshutz of _[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_ defined the track: \"A massive yet somehow intimate\ndance track, with the drums almost reaching hair metal levels in their\nvibrations. The Biebs handles his business, but Big Sean's verse probably\nisn't necessary.\"[21]\n\nBecky Bain of Idolator commented, \"The electro-infused track carries your\nbasic we-don’t-need-money-we-have-love sentiment, while Big Sean cameo is\nmostly useless, but it does come at a pivotal moment in the Darkchild-produced\ntune.\"[18]\n\nIn his review for [Fact Magazine](/wiki/Fact_Magazine_\\(United_Kingdom\\) \"Fact\nMagazine \\(United Kingdom\\)\"), Alex Macpherson described the track:\n\n> \"'As Long As You Love Me' is a post-austerity, us-against-the-world\n> electronic storm in which Bieber promises romantic fealty even as he's\n> buffeted this way and that by a cornucopia of sonic switch-ups courtesy of\n> Darkchild: the 4×4 march leading up to the peak of the second chorus, the\n> way the word 'love' is caught, cut up and tossed into a digital swirl until\n> it becomes helpless surrender. Notably and surprisingly, too, Bieber's own\n> delivery stands out: his blend of puppy-eyed pleading and genuine tenderness\n> on the line 'We could be homeless, we could be broke' is the song's\n> emotional pivot. It's enough to make you jealous of those terrifyingly\n> devoted Beliebers: imagine how much more intensely they’re feeling\n> this.\"[22]\n\n## Music\nvideo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=As_Long_as_You_Love_Me_\\(Justin_Bieber_song\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Music video\")]\n\nAs part of promotion for \"As Long As You Love Me\", a music video, which was\nfilmed in early July 2012, was released.
