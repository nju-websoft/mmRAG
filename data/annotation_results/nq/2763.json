It is included on Neil's\nsecond studio album, _[Just for You](/wiki/Just_for_You_\\(Neil_Diamond_album\\)\n\"Just for You \\(Neil Diamond album\\)\")_. The lyrics are sung from the\nperspective of a person who finds that drinking [red wine](/wiki/Red_wine \"Red\nwine\") is the only way to forget his woes.\n\nWhen Neil left the [Bang Records](/wiki/Bang_Records \"Bang Records\") label in\n1968, Bang continued to release Neil Diamond singles, often adding newly\nrecorded instruments and background vocals to album tracks from the two Neil\nDiamond albums that Bang had issued. For the \"Red Red Wine\" single, Bang added\na background choir without Neil's involvement or permission. Diamond's version\nreached number sixty-two on the [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100\n\"Billboard Hot 100\") chart in 1968. A live version was released on Diamond's\n_The Greatest Hits (1966–92)_ but the 1968 single version has never been\nissued on a vinyl album or CD.\n\nThe song was covered by several artists shortly after Diamond's recording was\nreleased. In 1968, the Dutch singer [Peter Tetteroo](/wiki/Peter_Tetteroo\n\"Peter Tetteroo\") (from the band [Tee Set](/wiki/Tee_Set \"Tee Set\")) had a hit\nwith a cover of the song in [Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands \"Netherlands\").\n[Tony Tribe](/wiki/Tony_Tribe \"Tony Tribe\") covered the song in 1969 in a\n[reggae](/wiki/Reggae \"Reggae\")-influenced style. In 1983, [UB40](/wiki/UB40\n\"UB40\") recorded perhaps the best known version of the song, in a lighter\nreggae style. The UB40 version topped the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") and the [UK Singles\nChart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\"). Diamond later performed a\nUB40-inspired version of the song while on tour.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Chart performance\n  * 2 UB40 version\n    * 2.1 Charts\n    * 2.2 Certifications\n    * 2.3 Chart successions\n  * 3 Other cover songs\n  * 4 References\n\n## Chart\nperformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Red_Wine&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Chart performance\")]\n\nChart (1969) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nU.S. _Billboard_ [Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") | 62  \n  \n## UB40 version[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Red_Red_Wine&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: UB40 version\")]\n\n\"Red Red Wine\"  \n---  \n[![Red Red\nWine.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Red_Red_Wine.jpg/220px-\nRed_Red_Wine.jpg)](/wiki/File:Red_Red_Wine.jpg)  \n[Single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\") by [UB40](/wiki/UB40\n\"UB40\")  \nfrom the album _[Labour of Love](/wiki/Labour_of_Love \"Labour of Love\")_  \n[B-side](/wiki/A-side_and_B-side \"A-side and B-side\") | \"Sufferin'\"  \nReleased | \n\n  * 8 August 1983 (1983-08-08)\n  * 1988–2000 (re-releases)\n\n  \nFormat | \n\n  * [7\"](/wiki/7%22_single \"7\" single\")\n  * [12\"](/wiki/12%22_single \"12\" single\")\n\n  \nRecorded | 1982  \n[Genre](/wiki/Music_genre \"Music genre\") | [Reggae fusion](/wiki/Reggae_fusion \"Reggae fusion\")  \nLength | 5:20  \n[Label](/wiki/Record_label \"Record label\") | \n\n  * [DEP](/wiki/DEP_International \"DEP International\") (UK)\n  * [A&M](/wiki/A%26M_Records \"A&M Records\") (US)\n  * [Virgin](/wiki/Virgin_Records \"Virgin Records\")\n\n  \n[Songwriter(s)](/wiki/Songwriter \"Songwriter\") | Neil Diamond  \n[Producer(s)](/wiki/Record_producer \"Record producer\") | \n\n  * [Ray \"Pablo\" Falconer](/wiki/Pablo_Falconer \"Pablo Falconer\")\n  * UB40\n\n  \n[UB40](/wiki/UB40 \"UB40\") singles chronology  \n| \"I've Got Mine\"  \n(1983) | \"**Red Red Wine** \"  \n(1983) | \"[Please Don't Make Me Cry](/wiki/Please_Don%27t_Make_Me_Cry \"Please Don't Make Me Cry\")\"  \n(1983)  \n---|---|---  \n| \"I've Got Mine\"  \n(1983) | \"**Red Red Wine** \"  \n(1983–2000) | \"[Please Don't Make Me Cry](/wiki/Please_Don%27t_Make_Me_Cry \"Please Don't Make Me Cry\")\"  \n(1983)  \n---|---|---  \n  \n[UB40](/wiki/UB40 \"UB40\") recorded their rendition for their album of [cover\nversions](/wiki/Cover_versions \"Cover versions\"), _[Labour of\nLove](/wiki/Labour_of_Love \"Labour of Love\")_.
