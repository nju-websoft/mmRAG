The\npresenter, if possible a member of the same service as the deceased, will\ngenerally kneel while presenting the folded flag, with the straight edge of\nthe flag facing the recipient. The presenter then recites the following\nwording, which was standardized on April 20, 2012:[8]\n\n> On behalf of the President of the United States, the United States (Army,\n> Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force or Coast Guard ), and a grateful nation,\n> please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one's\n> honorable and faithful service.\n\nThree spent [shell-casings](/wiki/Cartridge_\\(firearms\\) \"Cartridge\n\\(firearms\\)\"), each representing one of three volleys, were sometimes slipped\ninto the folds of the flag before its presentation to the [next of\nkin](/wiki/Next_of_kin \"Next of kin\"). The intention was to convey that the\npresence of the shell-casings proved that a rifle volley had taken place in\nconnection with the members funeral.[9][10] However, this practice has become\ninfrequent and is rarely seen today as Title 4, Section 8(h) of the [United\nStates Code](/wiki/United_States_Code \"United States Code\") specifies that the\nflag should not be used as a receptacle for holding anything.[11]\n\n## Ramp\nceremonies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Military_funerals_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Ramp ceremonies\")]\n\nA \"ramp ceremony\" is a memorial ceremony, not an actual funeral, for a soldier\nkilled in a war zone held at an airfield near or in a location where an\nairplane is waiting nearby to take the deceased's remains to his or her home\ncountry.
