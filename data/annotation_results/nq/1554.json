        "# The Dragon (_Beowulf_)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Beowulf_and_the_dragon.jpg/260px-\nBeowulf_and_the_dragon.jpg)](/wiki/File:Beowulf_and_the_dragon.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Beowulf_and_the_dragon.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Beowulf](/wiki/Beowulf_\\(hero\\) \"Beowulf \\(hero\\)\") battles his\n[nemesis](/wiki/Archenemy \"Archenemy\"), the dragon, shown in an 1908\nillustration by [J. R.\nSkelton](/w/index.php?title=J._R._Skelton&action=edit&redlink=1 \"J. R. Skelton\n\\(page does not exist\\)\").\n\nThe final act of the [Anglo-Saxon](/wiki/Anglo-Saxon \"Anglo-Saxon\") poem\n_[Beowulf](/wiki/Beowulf \"Beowulf\")_ is about the hero\n[Beowulf](/wiki/Beowulf_\\(hero\\) \"Beowulf \\(hero\\)\")'s fight with a\n[dragon](/wiki/Dragon \"Dragon\"), the third monster he encounters in the\n[epic](/wiki/Epic_poetry \"Epic poetry\"). On his return from\n[Heorot](/wiki/Heorot \"Heorot\"), where he killed [Grendel](/wiki/Grendel\n\"Grendel\") and [Grendel's mother](/wiki/Grendel%27s_mother \"Grendel's\nmother\"), Beowulf becomes king of the [Geats](/wiki/Geats \"Geats\") and rules\npeacefully for fifty winters until a slave awakens and angers a dragon by\nstealing a jewelled cup from its lair in order to gain freedom from killing\nhis brother. When the angry dragon mercilessly burns the Geats' homes and\nlands, Beowulf decides to fight and kill the monster personally. He and his\n[thanes](/wiki/Thanes \"Thanes\") climb to the dragon's lair where, upon seeing\nthe beast, the thanes flee in terror, leaving only [Wiglaf](/wiki/Wiglaf\n\"Wiglaf\") to battle at Beowulf's side. When the dragon wounds Beowulf fatally,\nWiglaf slays it.\n\nThis depiction indicates the growing importance and stabilization of the\nmodern concept of the dragon within European mythology. _Beowulf_ is the first\npiece of English literature to present a dragonslayer. Although many\n[motifs](/wiki/Motif_\\(narrative\\) \"Motif \\(narrative\\)\") common to the\n_Beowulf_ dragon existed in the Scandinavian and Germanic literature, the\n_Beowulf_ poet was the first to combine features and present a distinctive\nfire-breathing dragon. The _Beowulf_ dragon was later copied in literature\nwith similar themes such as [J. R. R. Tolkien](/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien \"J. R.\nR. Tolkien\")'s _[The Hobbit](/wiki/The_Hobbit \"The Hobbit\")_ (1937), one of\nthe forerunners of modern [high fantasy](/wiki/High_fantasy \"High fantasy\").\n\nThe dragon fight, occurring at the end of the poem, is foreshadowed in earlier\nscenes. The dragon fight symbolizes Beowulf's stand against evil and\ndestruction, and, as the hero, he knows that failure will bring destruction to\nhis people after many years of peace. The dragon himself acts a mock \"gold-\nking,\" one who sees attacking Beowulf's kingdom as suitable retribution for\nthe theft of just a single cup.[1] The scene is structured in thirds, ending\nwith the deaths of the dragon and Beowulf.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Story\n  * 2 Background\n  * 3 Characterization\n  * 4 Importance\n  * 5 Critical reception\n    * 5.1 Before Tolkien\n    * 5.2 Tolkien, 1936: _The Monsters and the Critics_\n    * 5.3 After Tolkien\n      * 5.3.1 Scholarly opinion\n    * 5.4 General opinion\n  * 6 Legacy\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 Sources\n\n##\nStory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Story\")]\n\nAfter his battles against [Grendel's mother](/wiki/Grendel%27s_mother\n\"Grendel's mother\") and [Grendel](/wiki/Grendel \"Grendel\"),\n[Beowulf](/wiki/Beowulf \"Beowulf\") returns to homeland and becomes king of the\n[Geats](/wiki/Geats \"Geats\"). Fifty years pass with Beowulf leading as a wise\nking, when a local dragon is angered when a slave enters its lair and takes a\ncup from its treasure. The creature attacks the neighboring towns in revenge.\nBeowulf and a troop of men (“the Geats”) leave to find the dragon’s lair. The\nGeats run away in fear, leaving only Beowulf and his young companion\n[Wiglaf](/wiki/Wiglaf \"Wiglaf\") to slay the dragon. Beowulf receives a fatal\nwound from the dragon, but Wiglaf impales the dragon’s belly to reduce the\nflames, and Beowulf deals the fatal blow. In his death-speech, Beowulf\nnominates Wiglaf as his heir, and that of the treasure.\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Ring44.jpg/220px-\nRing44.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ring44.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ring44.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSigurd and Fafnir by [Arthur Rackham](/wiki/Arthur_Rackham \"Arthur Rackham\"),\nfrom his 1911 illustrations for [Richard Wagner](/wiki/Richard_Wagner \"Richard\nWagner\")'s _[Siegfried](/wiki/Siegfried_\\(opera\\) \"Siegfried \\(opera\\)\")_ and\n_[The Twilight of the Gods](/wiki/G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung\n\"Götterdämmerung\")_\n\n_Beowulf_ is the oldest extant heroic poem in [English\nliterature](/wiki/English_literature \"English literature\") and the first to\npresent a dragon slayer. The legend of the dragonslayer already existed in\n[Norse sagas](/wiki/Norse_saga \"Norse saga\") such as the tale of\n[Sigurd](/wiki/Sigurd \"Sigurd\") and [Fafnir](/wiki/Fafnir \"Fafnir\"), and the\n_Beowulf_ poet incorporates motifs and themes common to dragon-lore in the\npoem.[2] _Beowulf_ is the earliest surviving piece of [Anglo-\nSaxon](/wiki/Anglo-Saxon \"Anglo-Saxon\") literature to feature a dragon, and it\nis possible that the poet had access to similar stories from [Germanic\nlegend](/wiki/Continental_Germanic_mythology \"Continental Germanic\nmythology\").[3] Secular Germanic literature and the literature of Christian\n[hagiography](/wiki/Hagiography \"Hagiography\") featured dragons and dragon\nfights.[4] Although the dragons of hagiography were less fierce than the\ndragon in _Beowulf_ , similarities exist in the stories such as presenting the\njourney to the dragon's lair, cowering spectators, and the sending of messages\nrelaying the outcome of the fight.[5]\n\nThe dragon with his hoard is a common motif in early Germanic literature with\nthe story existing to varying extents in the Norse sagas, but it is most\nnotable in the _[Völsunga saga](/wiki/V%C3%B6lsunga_saga \"Völsunga saga\")_ and\nin _Beowulf_.[6] _Beowulf_ preserves existing medieval dragon-lore, most\nnotably in the extended digression recounting the Sigurd/Fafnir tale.[2]\nNonetheless, comparative contemporary narratives did not have the complexity\nand distinctive elements written into _Beowulf '_s dragon scene. Beowulf is a\nhero who previously killed two monsters. The scene includes extended\nflashbacks to the Geatish-Swedish wars, a detailed description of the dragon\nand the dragon-hoard, and ends with intricate funerary imagery.[7]\n\n_Beowulf_ scholar [J. R. R. Tolkien](/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien \"J. R. R.\nTolkien\") considered the dragon in _Beowulf_ to be one of only two real\ndragons in northern European literature, writing of it, \"dragons, real\ndragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are\nactually rare. In northern literature there are only two that are significant\n... we have but the dragon of the Völsungs, Fáfnir, and Beowulf's bane.\"[8]\nFurthermore, Tolkien believes the _Beowulf_ poet emphasizes the monsters\nBeowulf fights in the poem and claims the dragon is as much of a [plot\ndevice](/wiki/Plot_device \"Plot device\") as anything. Tolkien expands on\n_Beowulf '_s dragon in his own fiction, which indicates the lasting impact of\nthe _Beowulf_ poem.[2] Within the plot structure, however, the dragon\nfunctions differently in _Beowulf_ than in Tolkien's fiction. The dragon fight\nends _Beowulf_ , while Tolkien uses the dragon motif (and the dragon's love\nfor treasure) to trigger a chain of events in _[The Hobbit](/wiki/The_Hobbit\n\"The Hobbit\")_.[9]\n\n##\nCharacterization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Characterization\")]\n\nSee also: [European dragon](/wiki/European_dragon \"European dragon\")\n\nThe _Beowulf_ dragon is the earliest example in literature of the typical\nEuropean dragon and first incidence of a fire-breathing dragon.[10] The\n_Beowulf_ dragon is described with [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old\nEnglish\") terms such as _draca_ (dragon), and _wyrm_ (reptile, or serpent),\nand as a creature with a [venomous](/wiki/Venom \"Venom\") bite.[11] Also, the\n_Beowulf_ poet created a dragon with specific traits: a\n[nocturnal](/wiki/Nocturnal \"Nocturnal\"), treasure-hoarding, inquisitive,\nvengeful, fire-breathing creature.[12]\n\nThe fire is likely symbolic of the hellfire of the [devil](/wiki/Devil\n\"Devil\"), reminiscent of the monster in the [Book of Job](/wiki/Book_of_Job\n\"Book of Job\"). In the [Septuagint](/wiki/Septuagint \"Septuagint\") Bible,\n[Job](/wiki/Job_\\(biblical_figure\\) \"Job \\(biblical figure\\)\")'s monster is\ncharacterized as a _draco_ , and identified with the devil.[10] Job's dragon\nwould have been accessible to the author of _Beowulf_ , as a\n[Christian](/wiki/Christian \"Christian\") symbol of evil, the \"great monstrous\nadversary of God, man and beast alike.\"[13]\n\nA study of German and Norse texts reveals three typical narratives for the\ndragonslayer: a fight for the treasure, a battle to save the slayer's people,\nor a fight to free a woman.[14] The characteristics of _Beowulf '_s dragon\nappear to be specific to the poem, and the poet may have melded together\ndragon motifs to create a dragon with specific traits that weave together the\ncomplicated plot of the narrative.[12]\n\n##\nImportance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Importance\")]\n\nThe third act of the [poem](/wiki/Epic_poetry \"Epic poetry\") differs from the\nfirst two. In Beowulf's two earlier battles, Grendel and Grendel's mother are\ncharacterised as descendants of [Cain](/wiki/Cain_and_Abel \"Cain and Abel\"):\n\"[Grendel] had long lived in the land of monsters / since the creator cast\nthem out / as the kindred of Cain\"[15] and seem to be humanoid: in the poet's\nrendition they can be seen as giants, [trolls](/wiki/Troll \"Troll\"), or\n[monsters](/wiki/Monster \"Monster\"). The dragon, therefore, is a stark\ncontrast to the other two antagonists.[16] Moreover, the dragon is more\novertly destructive. He burns vast amounts of territory and the homes of the\nGeats: \"the dragon began to belch out flames / and burn bright\nhomesteads\".[17][18]\n\nBeowulf's fight with the dragon has been described variously as an act of\neither [altruism](/wiki/Altruism \"Altruism\")[19] or recklessness.[20] In\ncontrast with the previous battles, the fight with the dragon occurs in\nBeowulf's kingdom and ends in defeat, whereas Beowulf fought the other\nmonsters victoriously in a land distant from his home. The dragon fight is\n[foreshadowed](/wiki/Foreshadowing \"Foreshadowing\") with earlier events:\n[Scyld Shefing](/wiki/Scyld \"Scyld\")'s funeral and Sigmund's death by dragon,\nas recounted by a [bard](/wiki/Bard \"Bard\") in Hrothgar's hall. _Beowulf_\nscholar Alexander writes that the dragon fight likely signifies Beowulf's (and\nby extension, society's) battle against evil.[21] The people's fate depend on\nthe outcome of the fight between the hero and the dragon, and, as a hero,\nBeowulf must knowingly face death.[22]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Beowulf_death.png/220px-\nBeowulf_death.png)](/wiki/File:Beowulf_death.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Beowulf_death.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nWiglaf is the single warrior to stay and witness the death of the hero.\nIllustration by J.R. Skelton.\n\nBeowulf's eventual death from the dragon presages \"warfare, death, and\ndarkness\" for his Geats.[23] The dragon's hoard symbolizes the vestige of an\nolder society, now lost to wars and famine, left behind by a survivor of that\nperiod. His imagined [elegy](/wiki/Elegy \"Elegy\") foreshadows Beowulf's death\nand elegy to come.[24] Before he faces the dragon, Beowulf thinks of his past:\nhis childhood and wars the Geats endured during that period, foreshadowing the\nfuture. At his death, peace in his lands will end, and his people will again\nsuffer a period of war and hardship.[25] An embattled society without \"social\ncohesion\" is represented by the avarice of the \"dragon jealously guarding its\ngold hoard\",[26] and the elegy for Beowulf becomes an elegy for the entire\nculture.[27] The dragon's hoard is representative of a people lost and\nantique, which is juxtaposed against the Geatish people, whose history is new\nand fleeting.[28] As king of his people, Beowulf defends them against the\ndragon, and when his thanes desert him, the poem shows the disintegration of a\n\"heroic society\" which \"depends upon the honouring of mutual obligations\nbetween lord and thane\".[29]\n\nWiglaf remains loyal to his king and stays to confront the dragon. The\nparallel in the story lies with the similarity to Beowulf's hero Sigemund and\nhis companion: Wiglaf is a younger companion to Beowulf and, in his courage,\nshows himself to be Beowulf's successor.[30][31] The presence of a companion\nis seen as a motif in other dragon stories, but the _Beowulf_ poet breaks\nhagiographic tradition with the hero's suffering (hacking, burning, stabbing)\nand subsequent death.[32] Moreover, the dragon is vanquished through Wiglaf's\nactions: although Beowulf dies fighting the dragon, the dragon dies at the\nhand of the companion.[29]\n\nThe dragon battle is structured in thirds: the preparation for the battle, the\nevents prior to the battle, and the battle itself. Wiglaf kills the dragon\nhalfway through the scene, Beowulf's death occurs \"after two-thirds\" of the\nscene,[33] and the dragon attacks Beowulf three times.[34] Ultimately, as\nTolkien writes in _[Beowulf: The Monsters and the\nCritics](/wiki/Beowulf:_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics \"Beowulf: The Monsters\nand the Critics\")_ (1936), the death by dragon \"is the right end for Beowulf,\"\nfor he claims, \"a man can but die upon his death-day\".[35]\n\n## Critical\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Critical reception\")]\n\n### Before\nTolkien[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Before Tolkien\")]\n\nIn 1918, William Witherle Lawrence argued in his article \"The Dragon and His\nLair in _Beowulf_ \" that the fight between Beowulf and the dragon tends to\nreceive less critical attention than other portions of the poem, commenting\nthat \"Grendel and his dam have, as it were, become more beloved of the\ncommentators\".[36] Conversely, [Kemp Malone](/wiki/Kemp_Malone \"Kemp Malone\")\nwrites in \"The Kenning in _Beowulf_ \" that Beowulf's fight with the dragon\nreceives much critical attention, but that commentators fail to note that \"the\ndragon was no fighter. Not that it refused to fight when challenged, but that\nit did not seek out Beowulf or anyone else. It left Beowulf to do the seeking\nout\".[37] In his 1935 work _Beowulf and the Seventh Century_ , [Ritchie\nGirvan](/wiki/Ritchie_Girvan \"Ritchie Girvan\") writes that _Beowulf_ should be\nseen as having some degree of historical accuracy despite the presence of a\ndragon in it; he argues that \"Tales of dragons as well as a belief in dragons\nsurvived till recent times, and the popular mind is apt to accept with\ncredulity stories of water-monsters. The stories, moreover, are often attached\nto real persons and localized precisely in time and place. The habit is so\nwell known that examples are superfluous\".[38] [Raymond Wilson\nChambers](/wiki/Raymond_Wilson_Chambers \"Raymond Wilson Chambers\"), in his\n_Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem with a Discussion of the\nStories of Offa and Finn_ , says that _Beowulf_ 's dragon acts like \"the\ntypical dragon of Old English proverbial lore\" because he guards treasure.[39]\n[W. P. Ker](/wiki/W._P._Ker \"W. P. Ker\") criticized the inclusion of Beowulf's\nfight with the dragon and his subsequent death in the poem, writing \"It is as\nif to the end of the _[Odyssey](/wiki/Odyssey \"Odyssey\")_ there had been added\nsome later books telling in full of the old age of [Odysseus](/wiki/Odysseus\n\"Odysseus\"), far from the sea, and his death at the hands of\n[Telegonus](/wiki/Telegonus \"Telegonus\")\".[40]\n\n### Tolkien, 1936: _The Monsters and the\nCritics_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Tolkien, 1936: The Monsters and the Critics\")]\n\nMain article: [Beowulf: The Monsters and the\nCritics](/wiki/Beowulf:_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics \"Beowulf: The Monsters\nand the Critics\")\n\nIn _[Beowulf: The Monsters and the\nCritics](/wiki/Beowulf:_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics \"Beowulf: The Monsters\nand the Critics\")_ , J. R. R. Tolkien noted that the dragon and Grendel are\n\"constantly referred to in language which is meant to recall the powers of\ndarkness which Christian men felt themselves to be encompassed. They are\n'inmates of hell', 'adversaries of God', 'offspring of Cain', 'enemies of\nmankind'....And so Beowulf, for all that he moves in the world of the\nprimitive Heroic Age of the Germans, nevertheless is almost a Christian\nknight\".[41]\n\n### After\nTolkien[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: After Tolkien\")]\n\n#### Scholarly\nopinion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Scholarly opinion\")]\n\nPeter Gainsford noted in the article \"The Deaths of Beowulf and Odysseus:\nNarrative Time and Mythological Tale Types\" that \"In the twenty-first century\n_Beowulf_ does not lack for commentators to defend the literary merit of the\ndragon episode\".[40] Adrien Bonjour opined in 1953 that the dragon's \"ultimate\nsignificance in the poem\" remains a \"mystery\".[42]\n\n### General\nopinion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: General opinion\")]\n\n_[The New Yorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker \"The New Yorker\")_ 's [Joan\nAcocella](/wiki/Joan_Acocella \"Joan Acocella\") wrote that \"unlike Grendel and\nhis mother, [the dragon] is less a monster than a symbol. He is not sad or\nweird. Indeed, he is rather glamorous\".[43] According to [Seamus\nHeaney](/wiki/Seamus_Heaney \"Seamus Heaney\"), the dragon \"could be read as a\nprojection of Beowulf's own [chthonic](/wiki/Chthonic \"Chthonic\") wisdom\nrefined in the crucible of experience\".[44] James Parker of _[The\nAtlantic](/wiki/The_Atlantic \"The Atlantic\")_ argues that because Beowulf dies\neven though he killed the dragon, \"There is no transcendence in _Beowulf_ ,\nand no redemption....kill the dragon—but the dragon will get you anyway\".[45]\n\n##\nLegacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Legacy\")]\n\nIn _From Homer to Harry Potter: A Handbook on Myth and Fantasy_ , [Matthew\nDickerson](/wiki/Matthew_T._Dickerson \"Matthew T. Dickerson\") and David O'Hara\nargue that the _Beowulf_ poet added the figure of the dragon to \"the\npot...that is ladeled out of by most modern fantasy writers\"; they argued that\nboth numerous works with villainous dragons, as well as literature with benign\ndragons like the _[My Father's Dragon](/wiki/My_Father%27s_Dragon \"My Father's\nDragon\")_ books and the _[Pern](/wiki/Dragonriders_of_Pern \"Dragonriders of\nPern\")_ series by [Anne McCaffrey](/wiki/Anne_McCaffrey \"Anne McCaffrey\"),\nwere influenced by _Beowulf_ 's dragon. Dickerson and O'Hara further\nelaborated that through its dragon, _Beowulf_ turned the \"notion of having a\nmonstrous evil (and not mere human foes) as the enemy\" into \"a hallmark of\nmodern fantasy\" present in [C. S. Lewis](/wiki/C._S._Lewis \"C. S. Lewis\")'\n[Narnia](/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia \"The Chronicles of Narnia\") books,\n[Ursula K. Le Guin](/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin \"Ursula K. Le Guin\")'s\n[Earthsea](/wiki/Earthsea \"Earthsea\") books, and the _[Thomas\nCovenant](/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant \"The Chronicles of Thomas\nCovenant\")_ series by [Stephen Donaldson](/wiki/Stephen_R._Donaldson \"Stephen\nR. Donaldson\").[46] J. R. R. Tolkien used the dragon story of _Beowulf_ as a\ntemplate for [Smaug](/wiki/Smaug \"Smaug\") of _The Hobbit_ ; in each case, the\ndragon awakens upon the hoard being disturbed by one stealing a chalice and\ngoes into a wrathful rampage until slain by another person.[47] Aia Hussein of\nthe [National Endowment for the\nHumanities](/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities \"National Endowment\nfor the Humanities\") has written that the fight between [Harry\nPotter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\) \"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\") and the\nHungarian Horntail in _[Harry Potter and the Goblet of\nFire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire \"Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire\")_ (2000) by [J. K. Rowling](/wiki/J._K._Rowling \"J. K. Rowling\") was\ninfluenced by the confrontation between the dragon and the title character in\n_Beowulf_.[48] James Parker of _The Atlantic_ saw similarities between the\ndragon in _Beowulf_ and the dragons in _[Game of\nThrones](/wiki/Game_of_Thrones \"Game of Thrones\")_ (2011-present).[45]\n\nThe tale of _Beowulf_ was translated and rewritten in [prose](/wiki/Prose\n\"Prose\") as a children's story by [Rosemary Sutcliff](/wiki/Rosemary_Sutcliff\n\"Rosemary Sutcliff\") in 1961, titled _Dragon Slayer_.[49]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Dragon_\\(Beowulf\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\nFootnotes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Nitzsche, Jane C. \"The Structural Unity of Beowulf: The Problem of Grendel's Mother.\" Poetry Criticism, vol. 22. 1999. pp. 290\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Evans, pp. 25–26\n  3. **Jump up ^** Rauer, p.135\n  4. **Jump up ^** Rauer, p. 4\n  5. **Jump up ^** Rauer, p. 74\n  6. **Jump up ^** Evans, pp. 29\n  7. **Jump up ^** Rauer, p.32\n  8. **Jump up ^** Tolkien, p. 4\n  9. **Jump up ^** Evans, p. 30\n  10. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Brown, Alan K.
