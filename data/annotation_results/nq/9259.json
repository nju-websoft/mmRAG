L. Walton, depicting the\nkilling of Aboriginal warriors at Slaughterhouse Creek by colonial police\ntroopers.\n\nThe **Waterloo Creek massacre** (also **Slaughterhouse Creek massacre**)\nrefers to a series of clashes between mounted police, civilian vigilantes and\nGamilaraay Australians in December 1837 - January 1838 which took place south-\nwest of [Moree](/wiki/Moree,_New_South_Wales \"Moree, New South Wales\"), [New\nSouth Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South Wales\"), Australia.[1] The\nevents have been subject to much dispute arising from conflicting views of\nrelatives and connections of the participants about the nature and number of\nfatalities, and the lawfulness of the action. Interpretation of events at\nWaterloo Creek was raised during an Australian controversy known as the\n\"[history wars](/wiki/History_wars \"History wars\")\" which commenced in the\n1990s.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 The events\n    * 1.1 'Disproportionate force'\n  * 2 Official inquiry\n    * 2.1 Police statements\n  * 3 Later historians' views\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## The\nevents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waterloo_Creek_massacre&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: The events\")]\n\nA [Sydney](/wiki/Sydney \"Sydney\") mounted police detachment was dispatched by\nacting [Lieutenant Governor of New South\nWales](/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_South_Wales \"Lieutenant Governor of\nNew South Wales\") Colonel [Kenneth Snodgrass](/wiki/Kenneth_Snodgrass \"Kenneth\nSnodgrass\"), to track down the\n[Namoi](/w/index.php?title=Namoi&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Namoi \\(page does not\nexist\\)\"), [Weraerai](/wiki/Weraerai \"Weraerai\") and\n[Kamilaroi](/wiki/Kamilaroi \"Kamilaroi\") people who had killed five stockmen\nin separate incidents on recently established pastoral runs on the upper\n[Gwydir River](/wiki/Gwydir_River \"Gwydir River\") area of [New South\nWales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South Wales\").[2] After two months the\nmounted police, consisting of two sergeants and twenty troopers led by Major\nJames Nunn, arrested 15 Aborigines along the [Namoi River](/wiki/Namoi_River\n\"Namoi River\"). They released all but two, one of whom was shot whilst\nattempting to escape.[3] The main body of [Kamilaroi](/wiki/Kamilaroi\n\"Kamilaroi\") eluded the troopers, thus Major Nunn’s party along with two\nstockmen pursued the [Kamilaroi](/wiki/Kamilaroi \"Kamilaroi\") for three weeks\nfrom present-day Manilla on the [Namoi River](/wiki/Namoi_River \"Namoi River\")\nnorth to the upper [Gwydir River](/wiki/Gwydir_River \"Gwydir River\").[4] On\nthe morning of 26 January in a surprise attack on Nunn’s party, Corporal\nHannan was wounded in the leg with a spear and subsequently four or five\nAborigines were shot dead in retaliation.[4] The Aborigines fled down the\nriver as the troopers regrouped, rearmed and pursued them led by the second-\nin-command, Lieutenant George Cobban. Cobban's party found their quarry about\na mile down the river at a point now known as Waterloo Creek, where a second\nengagement took place.[4] The encounter lasted several hours and no Aborigines\nwere captured.[5]\n\n### 'Disproportionate\nforce'[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waterloo_Creek_massacre&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: 'Disproportionate force'\")]\n\nAs there had been no declaration of martial law or other authorising\nlegislation, the police lacked authority to use more than reasonable force\nproportionate to any risk to the safety of persons or property. Nobody had a\nlicence to kill.[6]\n\nThe troopers may therefore have used disproportionate force directed towards\nindividuals who posed no risk to anybody or anything.\n\n> There was a suspicion that the troopers might have acted as an ill-\n> disciplined military force rather than as a regular police force.[6]\n\n## Official\ninquiry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waterloo_Creek_massacre&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Official inquiry\")]\n\nOn 5 March 1838, Nunn submitted a report on his expedition to the newly\narrived Governor Gipps.\n\nWithin the following month the Colony’s Executive Council (the Colonial\ngovernment constituted by the Governor and his advisers) accepted a\nrecommendation of their Attorney General, Mr J. H. Plunkett, that there be an\nofficial inquiry into the expedition, including the Aboriginal deaths.\n\nThe colonial government and the Colonial Office in England were both conscious\nof a need to extend the rule of law to Aborigines as well as other “British\nsubjects” in the Colony.\n\nOn 6 April 1838 the Executive Council decided to issue regulations in the form\nof a government notice announcing that there would be an inquiry (that is, a\ncoronial inquiry) into the death of any Aboriginal at the hands of a Colonist\nin the same way as that held when the death of a Colonist occurred through\nviolence or suddenly. However, the decision to publish this Inquiry notice was\ndelayed, with the Executive Council deciding to defer publication until after\n\"public excitement\" (about the Myall Creek murderers' executions) had abated.\n\nOn 14 August 1838 the Legislative Council appointed a Committee of Inquiry\ninto “the present state of Aborigines”, to be presided over by the Anglican\nBishop, [William Broughton](/wiki/William_Broughton_\\(bishop\\) \"William\nBroughton \\(bishop\\)\").\n\nGipps’s own inquiry into the Nunn expedition was delayed. He claimed to be\nunable to produce eyewitness evidence from mounted police owing to demands on\npolice attendance elsewhere, and he could not afford to alienate the police\nvolunteers upon whom policing then depended.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAdditionally, Colonists away from urban areas were tending to take the law\ninto their own hands.[7]\n\nSome argue that there was a breakdown in law and order, affecting the capacity\nof the NSW Government to govern.[6]\n\nAlthough the Nunn inquiry was reactivated on 22 July 1839 at the Merton\nCourthouse, New South Wales, there were no convictions and the matter was\ndropped. The only eyewitness accounts of the fatal main engagement were\nprovided by Lieutenant Cobban and Sergeant John Lee. Its outcome did not\nresult in any further judicial proceedings. [6]\n\nAttorney General Plunkett was reluctant to prosecute any of Nunn’s\nexpeditionary force, due to the time delays, the unavailability of reliable\nevidence and popular opposition.\n\nThe Executive Council decided to take no further action. It accepted that the\nAboriginal deaths at Waterloo Creek were the consequence of the police, led by\na military officer, acting honestly even if mistakenly or unwisely, under\norders and in execution of their duty, to repel an \"aggressive attack\" by\nAboriginals.[6]\n\n### Police\nstatements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waterloo_Creek_massacre&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Police statements\")]\n\nLieutenant Cobban claimed he rode to the rear of the group and found a large\ncache of Aboriginal weapons in the bush and secured them.[4] When he returned\nto the river, he admitted to seeing two Aborigines being shot, trying to\nescape and believed that at most three or four Aborigines had been killed in\nthe conflict.[4]\n\nSergeant John Lee was with the main detachment of mounted police that pursued\nthe Aborigines into the river. He claimed that forty to fifty Aborigines were\nkilled.[8]\n\n## Later historians'\nviews[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waterloo_Creek_massacre&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Later historians' views\")]\n\nMore recently, historians and other commentators have offered varying accounts\nof the site of the conflict and the number of casualties.\n\n  * R. H. W. Reece: The site was at the junction of the Slaughterhouse Creek and the Gwydir River, and 60 or 70 Aborigines were killed.[9]\n\n  * [Lyndall Ryan](/wiki/Lyndall_Ryan \"Lyndall Ryan\"): Sergeant Lee's estimate of 40 to 50 killed is the most reliable.[10]\n\n  * [Keith Windschuttle](/wiki/Keith_Windschuttle \"Keith Windschuttle\"): What occurred at Waterloo Creek was a legitimate police action in which at most three to four Aborigines were killed in the second encounter.[11]\n\n  * Roger Milliss: 200-300 Gamilaraay people were killed around the site of Snodgrass Lagoon at the Lower Waters of Waterloo Creek.[12]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waterloo_Creek_massacre&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of massacres of Indigenous Australians](/wiki/List_of_massacres_of_Indigenous_Australians \"List of massacres of Indigenous Australians\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waterloo_Creek_massacre&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Historical Records Of Australia, [Enclosure A6 to Minute No. 20 of 1839], 22 July 1839.
