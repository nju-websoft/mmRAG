        "# List of Dallas Cowboys seasons\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nFor complete team history, see [History of the Dallas\nCowboys](/wiki/History_of_the_Dallas_Cowboys \"History of the Dallas Cowboys\").\n\nThis article is a list of seasons completed by the [Dallas\nCowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\") [American\nfootball](/wiki/American_football \"American football\")\n[franchise](/wiki/Professional_sports_league_organization \"Professional sports\nleague organization\") of the [National Football\nLeague](/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\") (NFL). The\nlist documents the season-by-season records of the Cowboys' franchise from\n[1960](/wiki/1960_NFL_season \"1960 NFL season\") to present, including\npostseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches.\nThe Cowboys franchise was founded in 1960 as an expansion team.[1] The team\nhas earned 31 postseason appearances, tied for second place with the\n[Pittsburgh Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\"), the\nlongest consecutive streak of winning seasons with 20, the second-most\nappearances in the [NFC Championship\nGame](/wiki/National_Football_Conference_Championship_Game \"National Football\nConference Championship Game\") (14, behind the [San Francisco\n49ers](/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers \"San Francisco 49ers\")' 15) and the second-\nmost [Super Bowl](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\") appearances (8 with the\n[Denver Broncos](/wiki/Denver_Broncos \"Denver Broncos\") and\n[Steelers](/wiki/Steelers \"Steelers\")). The Cowboys have played for 10 [NFL\nChampionships](/wiki/History_of_National_Football_League_Championship \"History\nof National Football League Championship\") and have won 5, all five being\nSuper Bowls.[2]\n\nThe Cowboys won [Super Bowl VI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_VI \"Super Bowl VI\"),\n[XII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XII \"Super Bowl XII\"), [XXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXVII\n\"Super Bowl XXVII\"), [XXVIII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXVIII \"Super Bowl XXVIII\") and\n[XXX](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXX \"Super Bowl XXX\"). They also played in and lost\n[Super Bowl V](/wiki/Super_Bowl_V \"Super Bowl V\"), [X](/wiki/Super_Bowl_X\n\"Super Bowl X\"), and [XIII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XIII \"Super Bowl XIII\").[2]\n\nThe franchise has experienced two major periods of continued success in their\nhistory. The first period of success came from [1966](/wiki/1966_NFL_season\n\"1966 NFL season\")–[1985](/wiki/1985_NFL_season \"1985 NFL season\") when the\nCowboys played in the postseason 18 times.[3] During this period, they played\nin two NFL Championships and five Super Bowls, winning two of them, winning a\ntotal of 20 playoff games.[3] The second period of success was between\n[1991](/wiki/1991_NFL_season \"1991 NFL season\")–[1996](/wiki/1996_NFL_season\n\"1996 NFL season\") when the Cowboys captured five straight [NFC East\nDivision](/wiki/NFC_East \"NFC East\") titles and won three Super Bowls going\n11–2 in the postseason.[3]\n\nOutside of these 2 periods of success, The Cowboys have experienced long\nperiods failure in their history. The three most notable periods of failure\nwas from their [1960 inaugural season](/wiki/1960_NFL_season \"1960 NFL\nseason\") to [1965](/wiki/1965_NFL_season \"1965 NFL season\"), during which the\nCowboys did not have a single postseason appearance.[4] They did not win a\nsingle game during their first season, compiling an 0–11–1 record that is\nstill the worst in franchise history.[4] Also, they did not have a single\nwinning record in this period.[4] Between [1986](/wiki/1986_NFL_season \"1986\nNFL season\") and [1990](/wiki/1990_NFL_season \"1990 NFL season\") the Cowboys\nhad losing records in each season as veteran coach Landry retired and the team\nwas radically overhauled, with the low point being the NFL's second 15-loss\nseason (after [the 1980 Saints](/wiki/1980_New_Orleans_Saints_season \"1980 New\nOrleans Saints season\")) in [1989](/wiki/1989_NFL_season \"1989 NFL season\").\nAfter losing [a Divisional playoff Game](/wiki/1996%E2%80%9397_NFL_playoffs\n\"1996–97 NFL playoffs\") in 1996, the Cowboys between\n[1997](/wiki/1997_NFL_season \"1997 NFL season\") and\n[2008](/wiki/2008_NFL_season \"2008 NFL season\") lost five consecutive playoff\ngames, one after a franchise-record 13–3 season in 2007, during which most\npredicted the Cowboys would break this streak.[5] This streak finally came to\nan end when the Cowboys finally beat their bitter rival, the [Philadelphia\nEagles](/wiki/2009_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"2009 Philadelphia Eagles\nseason\") 34–14 after an 11–5 season in 2009.[5] From 1996 to 2017, a period of\n21 years, The Cowboys have only 3 post season wins, all taking place in the\nwild card round. In comparison since 2011 the Texans have an equal number(3)\nof postseason wins. The teams combined winning percentage since 1996 is under\n500 percent\n\n**[NFL Champions](/wiki/List_of_NFL_champions \"List of NFL champions\")** (1920–1969) | **[Super Bowl
