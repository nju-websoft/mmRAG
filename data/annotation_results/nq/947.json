The program's original name _**Queer Eye for the Straight Guy**_ was\nchanged after the third season to generalize the scope of its content.[1] The\nseries was created by executive producers David Collins and Michael Williams\nalong with their producing partner David Metzler; it was produced by their\nproduction company, Scout Productions.[2]\n\nThe series is premised on and uses the [stereotypes](/wiki/Stereotype\n\"Stereotype\") that homosexual (\"queer\") men are superior in matters of\n[fashion](/wiki/Fashion \"Fashion\"), style, personal grooming, [interior\ndesign](/wiki/Interior_design \"Interior design\") and culture. In each episode,\nthe team of five homosexual men known collectively as the \"Fab Five\" perform a\n\"[makeover](/wiki/Makeover \"Makeover\")\" (in the parlance of the show, a \"make-\nbetter\") on a person, usually a heterosexual (\"straight\") man, revamping his\nwardrobe, redecorating his home and offering advice on grooming, lifestyle and\nfood.[3]\n\n_Queer Eye for the Straight Guy_ debuted during 2003, and quickly became a\nsurprise success. The success of the series resulted in merchandising,\nfranchising of the concept internationally, and a woman-oriented [spin-\noff](/wiki/Spin-off_\\(media\\) \"Spin-off \\(media\\)\"), _[Queer Eye for the\nStraight Girl](/wiki/Queer_Eye_for_the_Straight_Girl \"Queer Eye for the\nStraight Girl\")_. _Queer Eye_ won an [Emmy Award](/wiki/Emmy_Award \"Emmy\nAward\") for Outstanding Reality Program during 2004. The series' name was\nabbreviated to _Queer Eye_ at the beginning of its third season to represent\nthe show's change from making over only heterosexual men to including women\nand homosexual men. _Queer Eye_ ended production during 2006 June and the\nfinal ten episodes were broadcast during October 2007. The series ended\nOctober 30.[4] During September 2008, the [Fine Living\nNetwork](/wiki/Fine_Living_Network \"Fine Living Network\") briefly aired _Queer\nEye_ in syndication.[5]\n\nOn January 24, 2017, [Netflix](/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\") announced it has\nordered a new season of _Queer Eye_ with eight episodes, with the original Fab\nFive set to be replaced by new members.[6]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 The \"Fab Five\"\n  * 2 Episodes\n  * 3 Production\n  * 4 Format\n  * 5 Popular and critical response\n  * 6 Spin-off series\n  * 7 International adaptations\n  * 8 Merchandising\n    * 8.1 Soundtrack\n      * 8.1.1 Track listing\n    * 8.2 Books\n    * 8.3 DVD releases\n  * 9 Revival\n  * 10 Notes\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n## The \"Fab Five\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queer_Eye&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: The \"Fab Five\"\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Queereye-promo.jpg/220px-\nQueereye-promo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Queereye-promo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Queereye-promo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCast of _Queer Eye_ , from left to right: Kyan, Jai, Carson, Ted and Thom\n\n  * [Ted Allen](/wiki/Ted_Allen \"Ted Allen\"): \"Food and Wine [Connoisseur](/wiki/Connoisseur \"Connoisseur\")\", expert on alcohol, beverages, food preparation and presentation\n  * [Kyan Douglas](/wiki/Kyan_Douglas \"Kyan Douglas\"): \"Grooming Guru\", expert on hair, grooming, personal [hygiene](/wiki/Hygiene \"Hygiene\"), and makeup\n  * [Thom Filicia](/wiki/Thom_Filicia \"Thom Filicia\"): \"Design Doctor\", expert on [interior design](/wiki/Interior_design \"Interior design\") and home organization\n  * [Carson Kressley](/wiki/Carson_Kressley \"Carson Kressley\"): \"Fashion Savant\", expert on clothing, fashion and personal styling\n  * [Jai Rodriguez](/wiki/Jai_Rodriguez \"Jai Rodriguez\"): \"Culture Vulture\", expert on [popular culture](/wiki/Popular_culture \"Popular culture\"), relationships and social interaction\n\n## Episodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queer_Eye&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Episodes\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Queer Eye episodes](/wiki/List_of_Queer_Eye_episodes\n\"List of Queer Eye episodes\")\n\nSeason | Episodes | Originally aired  \n---|---|---  \nFirst aired | Last aired | Network  \n| [1](/wiki/List_of_Queer_Eye_episodes#Season_1_.282003.E2.80.9304.29 \"List of Queer Eye episodes\") | 25 | July 15, 2003 (2003-07-15) | December 16, 2003 (2003-12-16) | [Bravo](/wiki/Bravo_\\(U.S._TV_network\\) \"Bravo \\(U.S. TV network\\)\")  \n| [2](/wiki/List_of_Queer_Eye_episodes#Season_2_.282004.E2.80.9305.29 \"List of Queer Eye episodes\") | 30 | June 1, 2004 (2004-06-01) | April 12, 2005 (2005-04-12)  \n| [3](/wiki/List_of_Queer_Eye_episodes#Season_3_.282005.E2.80.9306.29 \"List of Queer Eye episodes\") | 19 | June 7, 2005 (2005-06-07) | February 7, 2006 (2006-02-07)  \n| [4](/wiki/List_of_Queer_Eye_episodes#Season_4_.282006.29 \"List of Queer Eye episodes\") | 16 | June 6, 2006 (2006-06-06) | September 19, 2006 (2006-09-19)  \n| [5](/wiki/List_of_Queer_Eye_episodes#Season_5_.282007.29 \"List of Queer Eye episodes\") | 10 | October 2, 2007 (2007-10-02) | October 30, 2007 (2007-10-30)  \n  \n## Production[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queer_Eye&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Production\")]\n\nProducers Collins and Metzler were given approval by Bravo to develop _Queer\nEye_ after the ratings success the network experienced when it\n[counterprogrammed](/wiki/Counterprogramming \"Counterprogramming\") a marathon\nof its 2002 series _[Gay Weddings](/wiki/Gay_Weddings \"Gay Weddings\")_ at the\nsame time as [Super Bowl XXXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVII \"Super Bowl XXXVII\")\nduring 2003 January.[7] The [pilot episode](/wiki/Television_pilot \"Television\npilot\") was filmed in [Boston](/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts \"Boston,\nMassachusetts\"), Massachusetts during June 2002. Of the eventual Fab Five,\nonly Kressley and Allen appeared. The culture, design and grooming roles were\nfilled by James Hannaham, Charles Daboub, Jr. and Sam Spector, respectively.\n\nThe pilot was delivered to Bravo during September 2002, and was well received\nin audience testing. Soon thereafter [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\") purchased Bravo\nand ordered 12 episodes of the series. NBC promoted the show extensively,\nincluding [billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(advertising\\) \"Billboard\n\\(advertising\\)\") campaigns and print advertisements in national magazines.[2]\n\n[Kyan Douglas](/wiki/Kyan_Douglas \"Kyan Douglas\") and [Thom\nFilicia](/wiki/Thom_Filicia \"Thom Filicia\") joined the show for these\nepisodes, along with [Blair Boone](/wiki/Blair_Boone \"Blair Boone\") in the\nrole of \"culture guy.\" Boone filmed two episodes (which were broadcast as the\nsecond and third episodes and for which he was credited as a \"guest culture\nexpert\") but was replaced by Rodriguez beginning with production of the third\nepisode.[8] Each episode was shot over a span of four days and edited to\ncreate the perception that the events of the episode took place in a single\nday.[2]\n\n## Format[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queer_Eye&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Format\")]\n\nThe majority of _Queer Eye_ episodes use the same basic format. The episode\nbegins with the Fab Five in an [SUV](/wiki/SUV \"SUV\") (usually in [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\"), where the series was based)\ndiscussing their heterosexual subject. The Five review details of the\nsubject's personal life and note problems in their various areas of expertise.\nThe Five usually have a specific event for which they plan to prepare the\nsubject. These included everything from throwing a backyard barbecue for\nfriends to preparing to ask for a salary increase to proposing marriage.\n\nUpon arriving at the subject's home, the Fab Five go through his belongings,\nperforming a running commentary of catty remarks about the state of his\nwardrobe, home decor, cleanliness and grooming. They also speak with the\nsubject and family members to get an idea of the sort of style they like and\ntheir goals for the experience and to discuss the planned event.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Tv_bravo_queer_eye_for_the_straight_guy_logo.jpg/220px-\nTv_bravo_queer_eye_for_the_straight_guy_logo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tv_bravo_queer_eye_for_the_straight_guy_logo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tv_bravo_queer_eye_for_the_straight_guy_logo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSeries logo for the first and second season\n\nThe remainder of the first half of the episode follows the Fab Five as they\nescort the subject to various locales to select new furniture and clothes.\nOften, Ted demonstrates how to select and prepare food for a particular dish\nthat the subject will prepare for the special event, and Kyan takes him for\nspa treatments and a new haircut. Each such segment includes a style tip\nsuperimposed on the screen, summarizing the style issues addressed in the\nsegment. Interspersed with this are interview segments in which friends and\nfamily members of the subject discuss his style issues.\n\nIn the next section, the subject returns to a completely redecorated home and\nmodels articles of his new wardrobe for the Fab Five. Each of the Five offer\nfinal words of advice and encouragement, accompanied by supplies of grooming\nproducts, food and kitchenware, and in some cases expensive electronics items\nsuch as entertainment centers and computers.\n\nThe final section follows the subject as he prepares for the special event,\nwith the Fab Five watching edited footage of his preparations and critiquing\nhow well or how poorly he followed their advice. Finally, the subject is\nfollowed through the event itself, with the Five again performing a running\ncommentary and the subject often expressing his deep gratitude to the Fab Five\nfor their counsel. A final tip from each of the Fab Five, usually relating to\none of the topics covered in the episode, plays just before the credits.\n\nSpecial episodes of _Queer Eye_ that deviated from this formula included\nepisodes in which the Fab Five journeyed outside the greater New York area,\nincluding shows filmed in [England](/wiki/England \"England\"),\n[Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\"), and [Las Vegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada \"Las\nVegas, Nevada\"). In two episodes, the Fab Five made over homosexual men (both\nof which aired during June, Gay Pride Month, during 2004 and 2006) and in one\nepisode made over a transgender man. The show also featured makeovers of\nmembers of the [Boston Red Sox](/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox \"Boston Red Sox\") after\ntheir 2004 [World Series](/wiki/World_Series \"World Series\") victory, several\nholiday specials, and, in the final season, a \"Mister Straight Guy\"\n[pageant](/wiki/Beauty_pageant \"Beauty pageant\") featuring subjects from the\nseries' history.\n\n## Popular and critical\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queer_Eye&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Popular and critical response\")]\n\n_Queer Eye for the Straight Guy_ debuted on July 15, 2003 and the series\nquickly attained high ratings, peaking during September of that year with 3.34\nmillion viewers per episode.[9] The popularity of the series established the\nFab Five as media celebrities, with high-profile appearances at the\n[Emmys](/wiki/Emmy_Award \"Emmy Award\") and a \"make-better\" of [Jay\nLeno](/wiki/Jay_Leno \"Jay Leno\") and his _[The Tonight\nShow](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show \"The Tonight Show\")_ set in August of that\nyear.[10] Fab Five members parlayed their celebrity into endorsement deals,\nnotably Thom Filicia's becoming the spokesperson for [Pier 1\nImports](/wiki/Pier_1_Imports \"Pier 1 Imports\").[11][12]\n\nThe American press almost universally complimented the series and the Fab\nFive. _[Out](/wiki/Out_\\(magazine\\) \"Out \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine listed the\nFab Five in its \"OUT 100\", the \"greatest gay success stories\" of 2003.[13]\n_[Instinct](/wiki/Instinct_\\(magazine\\) \"Instinct \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine\ndeclared Kressley one of the \"Leading Men\" of 2004.[14]\n\nThe series attracted criticism for making generalizations about sexual\nidentity, namely that homosexual men are inherently more fashionable and\nstylish than heterosexuals.[15] Among those making this critique were [Tom\nShales](/wiki/Tom_Shales \"Tom Shales\") in the _[Washington\nPost](/wiki/Washington_Post \"Washington Post\")_ (\"stereotypes on parade\"),\nRichard Goldstein in _[Village Voice](/wiki/Village_Voice \"Village Voice\")_\n(\"Haven't fags always been consigned to the role of body servant?\") and United\nStates Congressman [Barney Frank](/wiki/Barney_Frank \"Barney Frank\") speaking\nto the _[New York Post](/wiki/New_York_Post \"New York Post\")_.\n\nWith the success of the first season, original \"culture guy\" [Blair\nBoone](/wiki/Blair_Boone \"Blair Boone\") sued the show for [breach of\ncontract](/wiki/Breach_of_contract \"Breach of contract\"), claiming he should\nbe paid not just for two episodes but for the season that he had been\ncontracted to film.[16]\n\nThe popularity of the series inspired a number of parodies. [Comedy\nCentral](/wiki/Comedy_Central \"Comedy Central\") hosted a\n[satirical](/wiki/Satire \"Satire\") television series named _[Straight Plan for\nthe Gay Man](/wiki/Straight_Plan_for_the_Gay_Man \"Straight Plan for the Gay\nMan\")_ , which featured four heterosexual men teaching homosexual men how to\nbe more stereotypically straight, redecorating their homes with neon beer\nsigns and teaching them about sports. _[South Park](/wiki/South_Park \"South\nPark\")_ spoofed the show and its hosts in the episode \"[South Park Is\nGay!](/wiki/South_Park_Is_Gay! \"South Park Is Gay!\")\", in which the\nprotagonists learn that the Fab Five are actually evil Crab People trying to\ncontrol the world by converting heterosexual men into\n[metrosexuals](/wiki/Metrosexual \"Metrosexual\").\n\n_Queer Eye_ won an [Emmy Award](/wiki/Emmy_Award \"Emmy Award\") for Outstanding\nReality Program during 2004 and was nominated for another Emmy in the same\ncategory during 2005. The series also received [GLAAD Media\nAwards](/wiki/GLAAD_Media_Awards \"GLAAD Media Awards\") for Outstanding Reality\nProgram during 2004 and 2005, and was nominated for a third during 2006.\n\nIn the second season, ratings decreased, averaging about 1.8 million viewers\nper episode with an average of 804,000 viewers in the important 18-40\ndemographic.[9][17] New episodes continued to be broadcast for two more\nseasons. Bravo confirmed in early 2007 that _Queer Eye_ had been cancelled.\nThe remaining fifth-season episodes were billed as _Queer Eye: The Final\nSeason_[18] and aired twice weekly beginning October 2, 2007.[19]\n\n## Spin-off series[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queer_Eye&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Spin-off series\")]\n\nDuring January 2005, Scout Productions premiered a spin-off series titled\n_[Queer Eye for the Straight Girl](/wiki/Queer_Eye_for_the_Straight_Girl\n\"Queer Eye for the Straight Girl\")_ , set in Los Angeles. It featured a cast\nof four lifestyle experts (three men and a woman, known as the \"Gal Pals\") who\nperformed makeovers for women. The show was cancelled after one season.\n\n## International\nadaptations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Queer_Eye&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: International adaptations\")]\n\n_Queer Eye_ 's American success caused television networks in several\ncountries to syndicate the American episodes, with a number of countries\ncreating their own local versions of _Queer Eye_ for broadcast in their\ncountries. However, few of these homegrown versions have proven as successful\nas the original, and most did not last long before cancellation. Licensing of\nthe format is managed by NBCUniversal.\n\nNBCU licensed television producer [David\nHedges](/w/index.php?title=David_Hedges&action=edit&redlink=1 \"David Hedges\n\\(page does not exist\\)\")[20] and his UK production house vialondon.tv to\nproduce local versions for Europe, with [Flextech](/wiki/Flextech\n\"Flextech\")'s [Living](/wiki/Living_\\(channel\\) \"Living \\(channel\\)\") channel\ndoing the same to produce the United Kingdom's version after a first attempt\nat a UK production by _Making Time_ was abandoned.[21]\n\nThe first episode of the [Finnish](/wiki/Finland \"Finland\") version, _[Sillä\nsilmällä](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sill%C3%A4_silm%C3%A4ll%C3%A4\n\"fi:Sillä silmällä\")_ , created controversy, not for the homosexual content\nbut for the blatant [product placement](/wiki/Product_placement \"Product\nplacement\") considered to be a transgression of a Finnish law against \"hidden\nadvertising\".\n\nCountry | Channel
