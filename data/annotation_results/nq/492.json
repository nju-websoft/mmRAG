Its campus is located in the [western](/wiki/Western_United_States\n\"Western United States\") United States in [Colorado](/wiki/Colorado\n\"Colorado\"), immediately north of [Colorado\nSprings](/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado \"Colorado Springs, Colorado\") in [El\nPaso County](/wiki/El_Paso_County,_Colorado \"El Paso County, Colorado\").\n\nThe Academy's stated mission is \"to educate, train, and inspire men and women\nto become leaders of character, motivated to lead the United States Air Force\nin service to our nation.\"[7] It is the youngest of the five U.S. [service\nacademies](/wiki/United_States_Service_academies \"United States Service\nacademies\"), having graduated its first class 59 years ago in 1959, however it\nis the third in seniority.[8] Graduates of the Academy's four-year program\nreceive a [Bachelor of Science](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science \"Bachelor of\nScience\") degree, and are commissioned as [second\nlieutenants](/wiki/Second_lieutenant#United_States \"Second lieutenant\") in the\nU.S. Air Force.[9] The Academy is also one of the largest tourist attractions\nin Colorado, attracting approximately a million visitors each year.[7]\n\nAdmission is extremely competitive, with nominations divided equally among\nCongressional districts. Recent incoming classes have had about 1,200 cadets;\nhistorically, just under 1,000 of those will graduate.[10] Tuition along with\nroom and board are all paid for by the Air Force. Cadets receive a monthly\nstipend, but incur a commitment to serve a number of years of military service\nafter graduation.[11]\n\nThe program at the Academy is guided by the Air Force's core values of\n\"_Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do_ \",[7] and\nbased on four \"pillars of excellence\": military training, academics, athletics\nand character development.[7] In addition to a rigorous military training\nregimen, cadets also take a broad academic course load with an extensive core\ncurriculum in engineering, humanities, social sciences, basic sciences,\nmilitary studies and physical education. All cadets participate in either\nintercollegiate or intramural athletics, and a thorough character development\nand leadership curriculum provides cadets a basis for future officership. Each\nof the components of the program is intended to give cadets the skills and\nknowledge that they will need for success as officers.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Establishment\n    * 1.2 Early years\n    * 1.3 Vietnam\n    * 1.4 Women at the Academy\n  * 2 Campus and facilities\n    * 2.1 The Cadet Area\n    * 2.2 Commemorative displays\n    * 2.3 Air Academy High School\n    * 2.4 Other locations on campus\n  * 3 The Honor Code and character education\n  * 4 Organization\n    * 4.1 The Cadet Wing\n    * 4.2 Base organization\n    * 4.3 Board of Visitors\n  * 5 Military training\n  * 6 Academics\n  * 7 Athletics\n    * 7.1 Physical education\n    * 7.2 Fitness tests\n    * 7.3 Intramural athletics\n    * 7.4 Intercollegiate athletics\n  * 8 Airmanship\n  * 9 Admissions\n    * 9.1 Class size\n  * 10 Traditions\n    * 10.1 Prop and Wings\n    * 10.2 Cadet sabre\n    * 10.3 Class ring\n  * 11 Controversies\n    * 11.1 Honor scandals\n    * 11.2 Allegations of sexual harassment, assault and gender bias\n    * 11.3 Religious atmosphere\n  * 12 Notable alumni\n  * 13 See also\n  * 14 Notes\n  * 15 References\n  * 16 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n###\nEstablishment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Establishment\")]\n\nPrior to the Academy's establishment, air power advocates had been pushing for\na separate Air Force Academy for decades. As early as 1918, Lieutenant Colonel\nA.J. Hanlon wrote, \"As the Military and Naval Academies are the backbone of\nthe Army and Navy, so must the Aeronautical Academy be the backbone of the Air\nService. No service can flourish without some such institution to inculcate\ninto its embryonic officers love of country, proper conception of duty, and\nhighest regard for honor.\"[12] Other officials expressed similar sentiments.\nIn 1919, Congressman [Charles F. Curry](/wiki/Charles_F._Curry \"Charles F.\nCurry\") introduced legislation providing for an Academy, but concerns about\ncost, curriculum and location led to its demise.[12] In 1925, air power\npioneer General [Billy Mitchell](/wiki/Billy_Mitchell \"Billy Mitchell\")\ntestified on [Capitol Hill](/wiki/Capitol_Hill \"Capitol Hill\") that it was\nnecessary \"to have an air academy to form a basis for the permanent backbone\nof your air service and to attend to the...organizational part of it, very\nmuch the same way that West Point does for the Army, or that Annapolis does\nfor the Navy.\"[12][13] Mitchell's arguments did not gain traction with\nlegislators, and it was not until the late 1940s that the concept of the\nUnited States Air Force Academy began to take shape.[12]\n\nSupport for an air academy got a boost with the [National Security Act of\n1947](/wiki/National_Security_Act_of_1947 \"National Security Act of 1947\"),\nwhich provided for the establishment of a separate Air Force within the United\nStates military. As an initial measure, Secretary of the Air Force [W. Stuart\nSymington](/wiki/W._Stuart_Symington \"W. Stuart Symington\") negotiated an\nagreement where up to 25% of [West Point](/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy\n\"United States Military Academy\") and\n[Annapolis](/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy \"United States Naval Academy\")\ngraduates could volunteer to receive their commissions in the newly\nestablished Air Force. This was only intended to be a short term fix, however,\nand disagreements between the services quickly led to the establishment of the\nService Academy Board by [Secretary of\nDefense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense \"United States Secretary of\nDefense\") [James Forrestal](/wiki/James_Forrestal \"James Forrestal\"). In\nJanuary 1950, the Service Academy Board, headed by [Dwight D.\nEisenhower](/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower \"Dwight D. Eisenhower\"), then president\nof [Columbia University](/wiki/Columbia_University \"Columbia University\"),\nconcluded that the needs of the Air Force could not be met by the two existing\n[U.S. service academies](/wiki/United_States_military_academies \"United States\nmilitary academies\") and that an air force academy should be established.[12]\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Board,\n[Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") passed\nlegislation in 1954 to begin the construction of the Air Force Academy, and\nPresident Eisenhower signed it into law on 1 April of that year.[14] The\nlegislation established an advisory commission to determine the site of the\nnew school. Among the panel members were [Charles\nLindbergh](/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh \"Charles Lindbergh\"), General [Carl\nSpaatz](/wiki/Carl_Spaatz \"Carl Spaatz\"), and Lieutenant General [Hubert R.\nHarmon](/wiki/Hubert_R._Harmon \"Hubert R. Harmon\"), who later became the\nAcademy's first superintendent. The original 582 sites considered were\nwinnowed to three: [Alton](/wiki/Alton,_Illinois \"Alton, Illinois\"), Illinois;\n[Lake Geneva](/wiki/Lake_Geneva,_Wisconsin \"Lake Geneva, Wisconsin\"),\nWisconsin; and the ultimate site at [Colorado\nSprings](/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado \"Colorado Springs, Colorado\"),\nColorado. The [Secretary of the Air\nForce](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Air_Force \"United States Secretary\nof the Air Force\"), [Harold E. Talbott](/wiki/Harold_E._Talbott \"Harold E.\nTalbott\"), announced the winning site on 24 June 1954.[15][16] Meanwhile, [Air\nTraining Command](/wiki/Air_Training_Command \"Air Training Command\") (ATC)\nbegan developing a detailed curriculum for the Academy program.[12]\n\n### Early\nyears[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Early years\")]\n\n[![Cadets lined up for physical\ntraining](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Air_Force_Academy_Cadets_physical_training.jpg/220px-\nAir_Force_Academy_Cadets_physical_training.jpg)](/wiki/File:Air_Force_Academy_Cadets_physical_training.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Air_Force_Academy_Cadets_physical_training.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCadets from the first USAFA class lined up for physical training at [Lowry\nAFB](/wiki/Lowry_AFB \"Lowry AFB\") in 1955\n\nThe early Air Force Academy leadership had the model of West Point and\nAnnapolis in designing an appropriate curriculum, faculty, and campus. The\nAcademy's permanent site had not yet been completed when the first class\nentered, so the 306 [cadets](/wiki/Cadet \"Cadet\") from the Class of 1959 were\nsworn in at a temporary site at [Lowry Air Force\nBase](/wiki/Lowry_Air_Force_Base \"Lowry Air Force Base\") in\n[Denver](/wiki/Denver \"Denver\") on 11 July 1955.[17] While at Lowry, they were\nhoused in renovated World War II barracks.[18] There were no upper class\ncadets to train the new cadets, so the Air Force appointed a cadre of \"[Air\nTraining Officers](/wiki/Air_Training_Officer \"Air Training Officer\")\" (ATOs)\nto conduct training. The ATOs were junior officers, many of whom were\ngraduates of West Point, Annapolis, and [The\nCitadel](/wiki/The_Citadel,_The_Military_College_of_South_Carolina \"The\nCitadel, The Military College of South Carolina\"). They acted as surrogate\nupper class cadets until the upper classes could be populated over the next\nseveral years.[12] The Academy's dedication ceremony took place on that first\nday and was broadcast live on national television, with [Walter\nCronkite](/wiki/Walter_Cronkite \"Walter Cronkite\") covering the event.[12]\n[Arnold W. Braswell](/wiki/Arnold_W._Braswell \"Arnold W. Braswell\"), a native\nof [Minden](/wiki/Minden,_Louisiana \"Minden, Louisiana\"), Louisiana, was\ncommander of the original four cadet squadrons at the academy 1955 to\n1958.[19]\n\nIn developing a distinctive uniform for cadets, the Air Force turned to\nHollywood. Famed director [Cecil B. DeMille](/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille \"Cecil B.\nDeMille\") designed the cadet parade uniform; it is still worn by cadets\ntoday.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nThe Class of 1959 established many other important traditions that continue\nuntil the present. The first class adopted the [Cadet Honor\nCode](/wiki/Cadet_Honor_Code \"Cadet Honor Code\"), and chose the\n[falcon](/wiki/Falcon \"Falcon\") as the [Academy's\nmascot](/wiki/The_Bird_\\(mascot\\) \"The Bird \\(mascot\\)\"). On 29 August 1958,\nthe [wing](/wiki/Wing_\\(air_force_unit\\) \"Wing \\(air force unit\\)\") of 1,145\ncadets moved to the present site near Colorado Springs,[20] and less than a\nyear later the Academy received accreditation. The first USAFA class graduated\nand was commissioned on 3 June 1959.[8][21]\n\n###\nVietnam[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Vietnam\")]\n\nThe [Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\") was the first war in which\nAcademy graduates fought and died. As such, it had a profound effect on the\ndevelopment of the character of the Academy. Due to the need for more pilots,\nAcademy enrollment grew significantly during this time. The size of the\ngraduating classes went from 217 cadets in 1961 to 745 cadets in 1970.[22]\nAcademy facilities were likewise expanded, and training was modified to better\nmeet the needs of the wartime Air Force. The [Jacks\nValley](/wiki/Jacks_Valley_\\(United_States_Air_Force_Academy\\) \"Jacks Valley\n\\(United States Air Force Academy\\)\") field training area was added, the\n[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and\nEscape](/wiki/Survival,_Evasion,_Resistance_and_Escape \"Survival, Evasion,\nResistance and Escape\") (SERE) program was expanded, and light aircraft\ntraining started in 1968.[22]\n\nMany Academy graduates of this era served with distinction in the [Vietnam\nWar](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\"). [F-4 Phantom\nII](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-4_Phantom_II \"McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II\")\npilot [Steve Ritchie](/wiki/R._Stephen_Ritchie \"R. Stephen Ritchie\") '64 and\n[weapon systems officer](/wiki/Weapon_systems_officer \"Weapon systems\nofficer\") [Jeffrey Feinstein](/wiki/Jeffrey_Feinstein \"Jeffrey Feinstein\") '68\neach became [aces](/wiki/Flying_ace \"Flying ace\") by downing five enemy\naircraft in combat.[23][24] One hundred forty-one graduates died in the\nconflict; thirty-two graduates became [prisoners of war](/wiki/Prisoner_of_war\n\"Prisoner of war\"). [Lance Sijan](/wiki/Lance_Sijan \"Lance Sijan\"), '65, fell\ninto both categories and became the first Academy graduate to be awarded the\n[Medal of Honor](/wiki/Medal_of_Honor \"Medal of Honor\") due to his heroism\nwhile evading capture and in captivity.[25] Sijan Hall, one of the cadet\ndormitories, is named in his memory.\n\nThe effects of the anti-war movement were felt at the Academy as well. Because\nthe Academy grounds are generally open to the public, the Academy often became\na site for protests by anti-war demonstrators.[22] Regular demonstrations were\nheld at the [Cadet Chapel](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy_Cadet_Chapel\n\"United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel\"), and cadets often became the\ntargets of protesters' insults. Other aggravating factors were the presence in\nthe Cadet Wing of cadets motivated to attend the Academy for reasons of\n[draft](/wiki/Conscription \"Conscription\") avoidance, and a number of highly\npublicized cheating scandals. Morale sometimes suffered as a\nconsequence.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Women at the\nAcademy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Women at the Academy\")]\n\nOne of the most significant events in the history of the Academy was the\nadmission of women.[26][27] On 7 October 1975, President [Gerald R.\nFord](/wiki/Gerald_R._Ford \"Gerald R. Ford\") signed legislation permitting\nwomen to enter the United States service academies. On 26 June 1976, 157 women\nentered the Air Force Academy with the Class of 1980. Because there were no\nfemale upper class cadets, the [Air Training\nOfficer](/wiki/Air_Training_Officer \"Air Training Officer\") model used in the\nearly years of the Academy was revived, and fifteen young female officers were\nbrought in to help with the integration process. The female cadets were\ninitially segregated from the rest of the Cadet Wing but were fully integrated\ninto their assigned squadrons after their first semester. On 28 May 1980, 97\nof the original female cadets completed the program and graduated from the\nAcademy—just over 10% of the graduating class. Women have made up just over\n20% of the most recent classes, with the class of 2016 having the highest\nproportion of any class, 25%.[10]\n\nMany of the women from those early classes went on to achieve success within\nthe Cadet Wing and after graduation (see list of Academy graduates below).\nDespite these successes, integration issues were long apparent. Female cadets\nhave had consistently higher dropout rates than men and have left the Air\nForce in higher numbers than men.[28]\n\n## Campus and\nfacilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Campus and facilities\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/AFA_protestant_chapel.jpg/220px-\nAFA_protestant_chapel.jpg)](/wiki/File:AFA_protestant_chapel.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AFA_protestant_chapel.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nInterior of [Cadet Chapel](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy_Cadet_Chapel\n\"United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel\")\n\nInitial proposals for the Air Force Academy location were between Prescott,\nArizona; Linn, Wisconsin; Alton, Illinois and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The\nselection committee cut the final list to only Alton, Linn and Colorado\nSprings. Final selection was awarded to Colorado Springs.[29]\n\nThe campus of the Academy covers 18,500 acres (29 sq mi; 75 km2) on the east\nside of the [Rampart Range](/wiki/Rampart_Range \"Rampart Range\") of the [Rocky\nMountains](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains \"Rocky Mountains\"), just north of [Colorado\nSprings](/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado \"Colorado Springs, Colorado\"). Its\n[elevation](/wiki/Elevation \"Elevation\") is normally given as 7,258 feet\n(2,212 m) above [sea level](/wiki/Sea_level \"Sea level\"), which is at the\ncadet area. The Academy was designed by [Skidmore, Owings and\nMerrill](/wiki/Skidmore,_Owings_and_Merrill \"Skidmore, Owings and Merrill\")\n(SOM) and lead architect [Walter Netsch](/wiki/Walter_Netsch \"Walter Netsch\").\nSOM partner [John O. Merrill](/wiki/John_O._Merrill \"John O. Merrill\") moved\nfrom Chicago to a Colorado Springs field office to oversee the construction\nand to act as a spokesman for the project.[30]\n\nThe most controversial aspect of the SOM-designed Air Force Academy was its\n[chapel](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy_Cadet_Chapel \"United States Air\nForce Academy Cadet Chapel\").[31] It was designed by SOM architect Walter\nNetsch, who at one point was prepared to abandon the design;[32] but the\naccordion-like structure is acknowledged as an iconic symbol of the academy\ncampus.\n\n### The Cadet\nArea[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: The Cadet Area\")]\n\nMain article: [United States Air Force Academy, Cadet\nArea](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy,_Cadet_Area \"United States Air\nForce Academy, Cadet Area\")\n\nThe buildings in the Cadet Area were designed in a distinct, modernist style,\nand make extensive use of aluminum on building exteriors, suggesting the outer\nskin of aircraft or spacecraft.[33] On 1 April 2004, fifty years after\nCongress authorized the building of the Academy, the Cadet Area at the Academy\nwas designated a [National Historic Landmark](/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark\n\"National Historic Landmark\").[34][35]\n\nThe main buildings in the Cadet Area are set around a large, square pavilion\nknown as \"the Terrazzo,\" and the most recognizable is the 17-spired [Cadet\nChapel](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy_Cadet_Chapel \"United States Air\nForce Academy Cadet Chapel\").[36] The subject of controversy when it was first\nbuilt, it is now considered among the most prominent examples of modern\nAmerican academic architecture. Other buildings on the Terrazzo include\nVandenberg Hall and Sijan Hall, the two dormitories; Mitchell Hall, the cadet\ndining facility; and Fairchild Hall, the main academic building, which houses\nacademic classrooms, laboratories, research facilities, faculty offices and\nthe [Robert F. McDermott](/wiki/Robert_F._McDermott \"Robert F.

It contains\nchemistry and biology classrooms and labs, medical and dental clinics, and\ncivil engineering and astronautics laboratories. The Cadet Area also contains\nan observatory and a planetarium for academic use and navigation training.\n\nThe cadet social center is Arnold Hall, located just outside the Cadet Area,\nwhich houses a 3000-seat theater, a ballroom, a number of lounges, and dining\nand recreation facilities for cadets and visitors. Harmon Hall is the primary\nadministration building, which houses the offices of the\n[Superintendent](/wiki/List_of_Superintendents_of_the_United_States_Air_Force_Academy\n\"List of Superintendents of the United States Air Force Academy\") and the\nSuperintendent's staff.\n\nThe Cadet Area also contains extensive facilities for use by cadets\nparticipating in intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical\neducation classes and other physical training. Set amid numerous outdoor\nathletic fields are the ‘‘Cadet Gymnasium’‘ and the Cadet Fieldhouse. The\nFieldhouse is the home to [Clune Arena](/wiki/Clune_Arena \"Clune Arena\"), the\n[ice hockey rink](/wiki/Cadet_Field_House_Ice_Arena \"Cadet Field House Ice\nArena\") and an indoor track, which doubles as an indoor practice facility for\na number of sports.

The ‘‘War Memorial’‘, a black marble\nwall located just under the flagpole on the Terrazzo, is etched with the names\nof Academy graduates who have been killed in combat. The ‘‘Honor Wall,’‘\noverlooking the [Terrazzo](/wiki/Terrazzo \"Terrazzo\"), is inscribed with the\n[Cadet Honor Code](/wiki/Cadet_Honor_Code \"Cadet Honor Code\"): \"We will not\nlie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.\" Just under the\nCadet Chapel, the ‘‘Class Wall’‘ bears the\n[crests](https://web.archive.org/web/20070128115104/http://www.usafa.af.mil/cadetFocus/cadetPhotos/shields3/index.cfm)\nof each of the Academy's graduating classes.

Cadets also recommend sanctions for violations. The\npresumed sanction for an honor violation is disenrollment, but mitigating\nfactors may result in the violator being placed in a probationary status for\nsome period of time.

In addition to their full academic course loads, heavy\ndemands are placed on fourth class cadets outside of class. Fourth class\ncadets are expected to learn an extensive amount of military and Academy-\nrelated knowledge and have significant restrictions placed on their movement\nand actions—traversing the Cadet Area only by approved routes (including\nstaying on the marble \"strips\" on the Terrazzo) and interacting with upper\nclass cadets using a very specific decorum.

After Recognition, the stringent rules of the\nfourth class year are relaxed.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAfter the first year, cadets have more options for summer military training.\nBetween their fourth and third class years, cadets undergo training in Air\nForce operations in a deployed environment (called Expeditionary Skills and\nEvasion Training [ESET]) and may participate in flying\n[gliders](/wiki/Glider_\\(sailplane\\) \"Glider \\(sailplane\\)\"), cyber-warfare\ntraining, satellite and space operations, unmanned systems, or free-fall\n[parachute training](/wiki/Parachuting \"Parachuting\"). From the late 1960s\nuntil the mid-1990s, cadets also completed\n[SERE](/wiki/Survival,_Evasion,_Resistance_and_Escape \"Survival, Evasion,\nResistance and Escape\") training in the [Jacks\nValley](/wiki/Jacks_Valley_\\(United_States_Air_Force_Academy\\) \"Jacks Valley\n\\(United States Air Force Academy\\)\") complex between their fourth- and third-\nclass years.

From there, it\nspread to the U.S. Naval Academy in the class of 1869.[66] The Air Force\nAcademy continued the tradition, beginning with the first class, 1959, and so\nis the only service academy to have had class rings for every class since its\nfounding. The Air Force ring is distinctive for being white gold instead of\nthe yellow gold used at the other academies. Each class designs its own class\ncrest; the only requirements being that each crest include all the elements on\nthe Class of 1959's crest: the class number, the class year, the Polaris star,\nand the eagle. One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other\nside bears the class crest; the center bezel bears the words United States Air\nForce Academy. Cadets choose their own stones for the center of the ring. The\nrings are received at the Ring Dance at the beginning of the Graduation Week\nfestivities for the class ahead of the ring recipients. The rings\ntraditionally are placed in glasses of champagne and are caught in the teeth\nfollowing a toast. During the cadet's first class (senior) year, the ring is\nworn with the class crest facing the wearer; following graduation, the ring is\nturned so that the class crest faces out. The rings of all the academies were\noriginally designed to be worn on the left hand, so that the wearer reads the\nname of the academy on the bezel while a cadet or midshipman and others can\nread it after graduation, the rings are now worn on either hand. The Academy's\nAssociation of Graduates (AOG) accepts rings of deceased graduates which are\nmelted down to form an ingot of white gold from which a portion of all future\nrings are made.[67] Both the academy's Association of Graduates and the\nAcademy Library maintain displays of class rings.\n\n##\nControversies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Controversies\")]\n\n### Honor\nscandals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Honor scandals\")]\n\nThe first Honor scandal broke in 1965, when a resigning cadet reported knowing\nof more than 100 cadets who had been involved in a cheating ring. One hundred\nand nine cadets were ultimately expelled.

The report also revealed 92 incidents of reported\n[sexual assault](/wiki/Sexual_assault \"Sexual assault\").[71] At the same time,\nthe Academy implemented programs to combat sexual assault, harassment and\ngender bias. The new programs actively encourage prompt sexual assault\nreporting. The Academy's decisive actions of zero tolerance were praised by\nofficials and experts.[72]\n\nFollowing the 2003 crisis, the Department of Defense directed its attention to\nthe problem of sexual harassment and assault at the military academies. The\nDepartment of Defense claimed that the program was successful although during\nthe school year 2010–11 there were increased reports of sexual assault at the\nacademy; however, one goal of the program is increased reporting.[73] There\nhave been several attempts to prosecute cadets for rape since 2003, but only\nthree have been successful convictions, citing the confidential informant\nprogram that ran from 2011-2012. The informant program was led by former AFOSI\nagent Brandon Enos, AFOSI's most successful agent in Air Force Academy's\nhistory in combating sexual assault and drug use amongst cadets. After the\nconfidential informant program was mysteriously disbanded in 2013 on orders\nfrom General Johnson, sexual assault reporting fell by half. On 5 January 2012\nrape charges were preferred against cadets in three unrelated cases.[74] To\nhelp combat these problems, the [United States Air Force Office of Special\nInvestigations](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Office_of_Special_Investigations\n\"United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations\") (AFOSI) created a\nsystem of cadet informants to hunt for misconduct among students.[75]\nAccording to _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York\nTimes\")_ in Academic Year 2014, \"after the informant program ended with no\nfurther convictions, reports fell by half.\"[76]\n\n_[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ has\ncited a letter to Congress from former AFOSI Agent, Staff Sergeant Brandon\nEnos, who said that Lieutenant General [Michael C.\nGould](/wiki/Michael_C._Gould \"Michael C.

In turn Gould said to the Times that the\nsuggestion that he had interfered with the investigation “preposterous.\"[76]\nGould was found guilty by a report from the Pentagon in June 2016 of\ninterfering with AFOSI investigations from 2011-2012, including blocking an\ninvestigation into the football coaches.

This behavior, described as \"so wild that AFOSI leaders\ncanceled a planned 2012 sting out of concern that undercover agents and\nconfidential informants at a party wouldn't be enough to protect women from\nrape,\" prompted the Academy superintendent to call for an investigation of the\nAcademy's athletic department.[77]\n\n### Religious\natmosphere[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=33\n\"Edit section: Religious atmosphere\")]\n\nIn 2005, allegations surfaced that some [Evangelical\nChristian](/wiki/Evangelicalism \"Evangelicalism\") cadets and staff were\neffectively engaging in religious proselytizing at the Academy.[78] These\nallegations, along with concerns over how the Air Force handles other\nreligious issues, prompted Academy graduate Michael L. Weinstein to file a\nlawsuit against the Air Force.[79][80] An Air Force panel investigated the\naccusations and issued a report on 22 June 2005.[81] The panel's investigation\nfound a \"religious climate that does not involve overt religious\ndiscrimination, but a failure to fully accommodate all members’ needs and a\nlack of awareness over where the line is drawn between permissible and\nimpermissible expression of beliefs.\" Evidence discovered during the\ninvestigation included [antisemitic](/wiki/Antisemitism \"Antisemitism\")\nremarks, official sponsorship of a showing of the film _[The Passion of the\nChrist](/wiki/The_Passion_of_the_Christ \"The Passion of the Christ\")_ and a\nlocker room banner that said academy athletes played for \"Team Jesus.\" In\nresponse to the panel's findings, the Air Force released new guidelines to\ndiscourage public prayers at official events or meetings and to facilitate\nworship by non-Christian religions.[82]\n\nIn 2010 the academy set up an outdoor worship area for cadets following\n[Wicca](/wiki/Wicca \"Wicca\"), [Neo-Druidism](/wiki/Neo-Druidism \"Neo-\nDruidism\"), or other earth-based religions to practice their faiths.[83][84]\n\nA 2010 survey found that 41 percent of academy cadets who identified\nthemselves as non-Christian reported they were subjected to unwanted religious\nproselytizing at least once or twice last year at the school. The survey's\nresults, however, showed that the number of cadets who felt pressured to join\nin religious activities had declined from previous years. Colorado congressman\n[Mike Coffman](/wiki/Mike_Coffman \"Mike Coffman\") criticized the academy for\nresisting calls to release details of the survey's results.[85][86]\n\nIn 2012, 66 House Republicans complained about policies set in place the last\nSeptember to curtail requirements to attend religious events.[87]\n\n## Notable\nalumni[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=34\n\"Edit section: Notable alumni\")]\n\nMain article: [List of United States Air Force Academy\nalumni](/wiki/List_of_United_States_Air_Force_Academy_alumni \"List of United\nStates Air Force Academy alumni\")\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=35\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png)[United States portal](/wiki/Portal:United_States \"Portal:United States\")\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png)[Military of the United States portal](/wiki/Portal:Military_of_the_United_States \"Portal:Military of the United States\")\n  * ![seal](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Seal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_the_Air_Force.svg/28px-Seal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_the_Air_Force.svg.png)[United States Air Force portal](/wiki/Portal:United_States_Air_Force \"Portal:United States Air Force\")\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Flag_of_Colorado.svg/32px-Flag_of_Colorado.svg.png)[Colorado portal](/wiki/Portal:Colorado \"Portal:Colorado\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Diploma_icon.png/28px-Diploma_icon.png)](/wiki/File:Diploma_icon.png)[Education portal](/wiki/Portal:Education \"Portal:Education\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Platopainting.jpg/23px-Platopainting.jpg)[University portal](/wiki/Portal:University \"Portal:University\")\n\n  * [Air Force Academy, Colorado](/wiki/Air_Force_Academy,_Colorado \"Air Force Academy, Colorado\")\n  * [Jabara Award](/wiki/Jabara_Award \"Jabara Award\")\n  * [KAFA-FM](/wiki/KAFA-FM \"KAFA-FM\") radio\n  * [United States Military Academy](/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy \"United States Military Academy\") (Army)\n  * [United States Naval Academy](/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy \"United States Naval Academy\")\n  * [United States Coast Guard Academy](/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard_Academy \"United States Coast Guard Academy\")\n  * [United States Merchant Marine Academy](/wiki/United_States_Merchant_Marine_Academy \"United States Merchant Marine Academy\")\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_Air_Force_Academy&action=edit&section=36\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** <http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/433412/united-states-air-force-academy-usaf/>\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"USAFA Endowment Audit Report 2014\"](http://www.usafa.org/Documents/Endowment/USAFAEndowment-Audit-Report-2014.pdf) (PDF).\n  3. **Jump up ^** [\"General Officer Announcements\"](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1112376/general-officer-announcements/).\n  4. **Jump up ^** [United States Air Force Academy - Profile, Rankings and Data](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/air-force-academy-1369) US News Best Colleges.
