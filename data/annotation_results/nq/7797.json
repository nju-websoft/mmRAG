Leiber has said the Coasters portrayed \"a white kid’s view of a\nblack person’s conception of white society.\"[2] The serio-comic street-smart\n“playlets” etched out by the songwriters were sung by the Coasters with a sly\nclowning humor, while the saxophone of [King Curtis](/wiki/King_Curtis \"King\nCurtis\") filled in, in the up-tempo doo-wop style. The group was openly\n\"theatrical\" in style—they were not pretending to be expressing their own\nexperience.[4]\n\nThe threatened punishment for not taking out the garbage and sweeping the\nfloor is, in the song's humorous lyrics:[5]\n\n    \"You ain't gonna rock and roll no more,\"\n\nAnd the refrain is:\n\n    \"Yakety yak; don't talk back.\"[6]\n\n## Popular culture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Yakety_Yak&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Popular culture\")]\n\n  * Québécois duo [Les Jérolas](/wiki/Jean_Lapointe \"Jean Lapointe\") recorded in 1959 a French version \"Rouspet' pas\"\n  * The sax solo by [King Curtis](/wiki/King_Curtis \"King Curtis\") inspired the 1963 [Boots Randolph](/wiki/Boots_Randolph \"Boots Randolph\") song \"[Yakety Sax](/wiki/Yakety_Sax \"Yakety Sax\")\"[7]\n  * [Sha Na Na](/wiki/Sha_Na_Na \"Sha Na Na\") performed this as part of their set at the original [Woodstock Festival](/wiki/Woodstock_Festival \"Woodstock Festival\") and recorded 2 live covers of the song in 1971 and 1972\n  * The song was covered by [Jan & Dean](/wiki/Jan_%26_Dean \"Jan & Dean\") and was planned to be released on their album _Carnival of Sound_ in 1968. _Carnival of Sound_ was not released until 2010.\n  * [Lee Perry](/wiki/Lee_%22Scratch%22_Perry \"Lee \"Scratch\" Perry\") released a cover version in 1969 (as Lee Perry and the Upsetters), altering the lyric \"You ain't gonna rock and roll no more\" to \"You ain't gonna reggae reggae reggae no more\"\n  * [The Pipkins](/wiki/The_Pipkins \"The Pipkins\") covered their song in 1970, produced by John Burgess.\n  * Electronic/disco group El Coco covered this song in 1975 with some comedy elements, taken from their debut album, Mondo Disco, released on [AVI Records](/wiki/AVI_Records \"AVI Records\").\n  * [Vince Vance & The Valiants](/wiki/Vince_Vance_%26_The_Valiants \"Vince Vance & The Valiants\"), one of multiple groups parodying [Barbara Ann](/wiki/Barbara_Ann \"Barbara Ann\") as \"[Bomb Iran](/wiki/Bomb_Iran \"Bomb Iran\")\" in 1980, created a similarly themed 2005 parody called \"Yakety Yak (Bomb Iraq)\".[8]\n  * [Stand by Me](/wiki/Stand_by_Me_\\(film\\) \"Stand by Me \\(film\\)\"), the 1986 classic coming of age drama included \"Yakety Yak\" on its iconic soundtrack.\n  * The song has also been mixed & recorded by [2 Live Crew](/wiki/2_Live_Crew \"2 Live Crew\") for the 1988 movie _[Twins](/wiki/Twins_\\(1988_film\\) \"Twins \\(1988 film\\)\")_.
