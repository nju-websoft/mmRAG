Bart Millard, the band's vocalist, lost\nhis father, Arthur Wesley Millard Jr.[1], in 1991. Millard was 18 at the\ntime.[2][3] Millard began writing the words \"I can only imagine\" on items when\nhe was thinking about his father.[4] During the recording of the band's 1999\nindependent album _[The Worship Project](/wiki/The_Worship_Project \"The\nWorship Project\")_ , MercyMe needed one more song to fill out the album.[5]\nMillard, alone on a bus in the middle of the night, finally wrote the lyrics\nto the song by drawing on his thoughts and personal faith about what one would\nexperience standing before God in Heaven. Millard attests that \"['I Can Only\nImagine'] is one of the only songs I have ever written where there wasn't any\nmistakes, it was just written the way it is and left at that\",[5] and\nestimated that it took him only ten minutes to write the lyrics.[4]\n\nIn writing the music for the song, however, the band faced more difficulty;\nMillard noted that \"at first it was a fast song... it was all these random\nideas\".[5] Keyboardist Jim Bryson noted that, \"we were literally tearing down\nthe stuff... [Millard] and I were talking about arranging it differently and\ndoing a slower version, so we just tried out a piano intro... it was literally\nthe first thing I played. It wasn't anything to do with me, I think it was\njust a God thing. [Millard] said 'here it is, this is what's going to happen',\nand we laid the song down in about five minutes.\"[5] At that time, the other\nMercyMe members were Robby Shaffer on drums and percussion, Nathan Cochran on\nbass guitar and Michael Scheuchzer on guitar. This line-up recorded the first\nversion of the song for _The Worship Project_.[3][6] In 2006, it was included\nin the 'Platinum Edition' of _Almost There_.[7]\n\n##\nComposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can_Only_Imagine_\\(MercyMe_song\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png) |  [I Can Only Imagine](/wiki/File:I_Can_Only_Imagine_2001.ogg \"File:I Can Only Imagine 2001.ogg\") ![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkqAcAAIUAgUW0RjgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/31/I_Can_Only_Imagine_2001.ogg) A sample of \"I Can Only Imagine\".

As a\nChristian I believed that, but as an 18-year-old it was a little hard to\nswallow.
