His first\n[television](/wiki/Television \"Television\") role was as a [stunt\ndouble](/wiki/Stunt_double \"Stunt double\") for [Ralph\nBellamy](/wiki/Ralph_Bellamy \"Ralph Bellamy\") in the detective series _[Man\nAgainst Crime](/wiki/Man_Against_Crime \"Man Against Crime\")_. In 1959 he\nstarred as detective Ken Franklin in the\n[ABC](/wiki/Associated_British_Corporation \"Associated British Corporation\")\nTV series _[International\nDetective](/w/index.php?title=International_Detective&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"International Detective \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ , credited as Arthur\nFleming. He also played [attorney](/wiki/Lawyer \"Lawyer\") Jeremy Pitt in _[The\nCalifornians](/wiki/The_Californians_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Californians \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ , an [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\") [Western](/wiki/Western_\\(genre\\)\n\"Western \\(genre\\)\") set in [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco,_California\n\"San Francisco, California\") during the gold rush of the 1850s. Fleming also\nappeared in many [television commercials](/wiki/Television_commercial\n\"Television commercial\"). He was first spotted by [Merv\nGriffin](/wiki/Merv_Griffin \"Merv Griffin\") on a commercial for [Trans World\nAirlines](/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines \"Trans World Airlines\"). Griffin thought\nFleming was \"authoritative, yet warm and interesting\", and Fleming was invited\nto audition for the role of host for a quiz show Griffin was developing.\nFleming (an actor with no prior TV quiz show experience) was initially\nskeptical, but his agent encouraged him to \"act like a game show host\" at his\naudition, and Fleming ultimately won the job.[1] The show was\n_[Jeopardy!](/wiki/Jeopardy! \"Jeopardy!\")_ , which Fleming hosted from March\n30, 1964, to January 3, 1975,[4] and again from October 2, 1978, to March 2,\n1979. Although often described as the \"host\" of the program, announcer [Don\nPardo](/wiki/Don_Pardo \"Don Pardo\")'s introduction of him announced, \"and\nhere's the star of Jeopardy!, Art Fleming.\" As \"the world's greatest quiz\nshow's\" first host, Fleming earned two [Emmy Award](/wiki/Emmy_Award \"Emmy\nAward\") nominations. While he was host of _Jeopardy!_ , Fleming never missed a\ntaping.\n\nBecause he hosted a quiz show, Fleming earned a reputation as being a\nstorehouse of trivia. While appearing as a guest star on _[Hollywood\nSquares](/wiki/Hollywood_Squares \"Hollywood Squares\")_ (another NBC game show\nin the 1960s and 1970s), Fleming was once selected as the \"secret square\". His\nquestion was, \"In 1938, who won the Wimbledon women's tennis championship?\"\nFleming picked Helen Wills Moody, one of the three choices read to him. The\nfemale contestant (who had selected Fleming) turned to _Hollywood Squares_ MC\nPeter Marshall, saying, \"Art Fleming would never lie! I agree!\" He was right,\nand the contestant won $11,000. Fleming later said he did not know a thing\nabout tennis and had guessed the answer. He hoped the contestant would\ndisagree, thinking he was wrong.\n\nThroughout his career, Fleming starred in about 5,000 episodes of television\nprograms and 48 motion pictures. After _Jeopardy! 's_ first cancellation in\n1975, Fleming returned to acting. In 1977 he played the role of [W. Averell\nHarriman](/wiki/W._Averell_Harriman \"W. Averell Harriman\") in the movie\n_[MacArthur](/wiki/MacArthur_\\(film\\) \"MacArthur \\(film\\)\")_ starring [Gregory\nPeck](/wiki/Gregory_Peck \"Gregory Peck\"), and appeared in the comedy film\n_[American Raspberry](/wiki/American_Raspberry_\\(film\\) \"American Raspberry\n\\(film\\)\")_ , and also appeared in episodes of _[Starsky and\nHutch](/wiki/Starsky_and_Hutch \"Starsky and Hutch\")_ , _[Kingston:\nConfidential](/wiki/Kingston:_Confidential \"Kingston: Confidential\")_ , and\nthe 1976 TV [miniseries](/wiki/Miniseries \"Miniseries\") _[The\nMoneychangers](/wiki/The_Moneychangers \"The Moneychangers\")_.\n\nFleming also hosted a radio version of _[College Bowl](/wiki/College_Bowl\n\"College Bowl\")_ for [CBS Radio](/wiki/CBS_Radio \"CBS Radio\") from 1979 to\n1982. He hosted the NBC radio weekend magazine _Monitor_ during 1972. Fleming\nreprised his role as host of _Jeopardy!_ in the 1982 movie _[Airplane II: The\nSequel](/wiki/Airplane_II:_The_Sequel \"Airplane II: The Sequel\")_ and in\n[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic](/wiki/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic \"\"Weird Al\" Yankovic\")'s\nmusic video \"[I Lost on Jeopardy](/wiki/I_Lost_on_Jeopardy \"I Lost on\nJeopardy\")\". Fleming was also often called upon to host mock versions of\n_Jeopardy!_ at [trade shows](/wiki/Trade_fair \"Trade fair\") and conventions.\n\nIt was reported that Fleming was asked to reprise his role as _Jeopardy!_ host\nwhen Merv Griffin began developing a revival of the show in 1983. He declined,\nlater stating in 1989 that he did not like the direction the show had gone in\nmoving the show to [Hollywood](/wiki/Hollywood \"Hollywood\") (being partial to\nhis native New York, he felt that the Hollywood setting made the show dumber\nand less realistic).[5] As a result, [Alex Trebek](/wiki/Alex_Trebek \"Alex\nTrebek\") took the position instead and has hosted the program ever since.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1992, Fleming hosted a daily [radio talk show](/wiki/Talk_radio\n\"Talk radio\") on [KMOX](/wiki/KMOX \"KMOX\") in [St.\nLouis](/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri \"St. Louis, Missouri\"), which continued until\nhis retirement. On Sunday evenings, he occasionally co-hosted _Trivia\nSpectacular_ with David Strauss, a St. Louis schoolteacher. He also hosted the\nsyndicated radio program _[When Radio Was](/wiki/When_Radio_Was \"When Radio\nWas\")_.\n\n## Personal life[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Art_Fleming&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Personal life\")]\n\nMr. Fleming was first married to actress Peggy Ann Ellis, who worked on _[The\nMerv Griffin Show](/wiki/The_Merv_Griffin_Show \"The Merv Griffin\nShow\")_.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] They had a daughter, Jan Marie Hanna[6] and\nwere divorced after five years. Fleming then married Rebecca \"Becky\" Lynn in a\nprivate ceremony at Norman Vincent Peale's home. Becky brought two children\ninto the marriage. He also had four grandchildren. In 1992, Fleming retired\nand the family moved to [Crystal River, Florida](/wiki/Crystal_River,_Florida\n\"Crystal River, Florida\"). He remained active in [charity\nwork](/wiki/Charitable_trust \"Charitable trust\"): he hosted\n[fundraising](/wiki/Fundraising \"Fundraising\") videos for the [Citrus\nCounty](/wiki/Citrus_County \"Citrus County\") [United\nWay](/wiki/United_Way_of_America \"United Way of America\") and became involved\nwith the [Citrus County Abuse Shelter Association,\nInc.](/w/index.php?title=Citrus_County_Abuse_Shelter_Association,_Inc.&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Citrus County Abuse Shelter Association, Inc. \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n(where Becky served as director).
