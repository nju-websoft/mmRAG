On May 8, 2013, it\nwas officially announced that a substantial portion of phase two would be\nconstructed in the adjacent Universal Studios Florida theme park with a [full\nscale working replica of the Hogwarts\nExpress](/wiki/Hogwarts_Express_\\(Universal_Orlando_Resort\\) \"Hogwarts Express\n\\(Universal Orlando Resort\\)\") taking guests between the two lands.

By July, the [Flying\nUnicorn](/wiki/Flying_Unicorn \"Flying Unicorn\") and Enchanted Oak Tavern were\nclosed. The Flying Unicorn then began an almost two-year refurbishment which\ntransformed it into the [Flight of the\nHippogriff](/wiki/Flight_of_the_Hippogriff \"Flight of the Hippogriff\"). The\nEnchanted Oak Tavern was later demolished. A bridge was built to connect The\nLost Continent with [Jurassic Park](/wiki/Islands_of_adventure#Jurassic_Park\n\"Islands of adventure\") allowing guests to avoid the construction zone that\nwas to become the Wizarding World. Construction progressed with the Hogwarts\nCastle slowly taking shape. By September 2008, the Dueling Dragons entrance\nwas moved to Jurassic Park to make room for construction of Hogsmeade. One\nmonth later, the old entrance was demolished. By September 2009, the top shell\nof Hogwarts Castle was completed. On September 15, an announcement was made\ndetailing what was going to be included in the Wizarding World. In early 2010,\nUniversal increased its marketing of the area, which included newspaper\nadvertisements, billboards and television commercials.

Several of these are\nrecreations of locations in the Harry Potter books while others have been\ncreated specifically for the park. A recreation of Hogsmeade is housed at\nIslands of Adventure while a recreation of Diagon Alley is housed at Universal\nStudios Florida.\n\nIn the book series, [Ollivanders wand shop](/wiki/Ollivanders \"Ollivanders\")\nis located in [Diagon Alley](/wiki/Diagon_Alley \"Diagon Alley\"), not\n[Hogsmeade](/wiki/Hogsmeade \"Hogsmeade\"); however, installations of the shop\nare present in both areas of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The\nHogsmeade attraction recreated the shop as \"Ollivanders\", portraying it as a\n[branch](/wiki/Branch_\\(banking\\) \"Branch \\(banking\\)\") of the original where\nHarry purchases his [wand](/wiki/Wand \"Wand\") in _[Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher's Stone](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Harry\nPotter and the Philosopher's Stone\")_ (known in the United States as _Harry\nPotter and the Sorcerer 's Stone_). Unlike other shops in the Wizarding World\nof Harry Potter, visitors are admitted in groups of 20 to experience the\npremise from the _Potter_ series, that \"the wand chooses the wizard\". Similar\nto the first film, the wand keeper and a selected guest test a variety of\nwands until the right one is found. Effects include flowers drying out or a\nthunderstorm erupting inside the shop. After experiencing the attraction,\nsouvenir wands can be purchased.[70]\n\n###\nHogsmeade[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Wizarding_World_of_Harry_Potter_\\(Universal_Orlando_Resort\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Hogsmeade\")]\n\n[![A recreation of the Hogwarts\nExpress](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/HogwartsExpressUniversalStudios.JPG/220px-\nHogwartsExpressUniversalStudios.JPG)](/wiki/File:HogwartsExpressUniversalStudios.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:HogwartsExpressUniversalStudios.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nA recreation of the [Hogwarts Express](/wiki/GWR_4900_Class_5972_Olton_Hall\n\"GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall\") locomotive greets guests when entering\nHogsmeade\n\nA recreation of the _[Hogwarts Express](/wiki/Hogwarts_Express \"Hogwarts\nExpress\")_ lies at the entry to Hogsmeade.
