The first, second and fourth seasons were filmed on northern\n[Vancouver Island, British Columbia](/wiki/Vancouver_Island \"Vancouver\nIsland\"), and the third near [Nahuel Huapi National\nPark](/wiki/Nahuel_Huapi_National_Park \"Nahuel Huapi National Park\") in\n[Patagonia](/wiki/Patagonia \"Patagonia\"), [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina\n\"Argentina\"). It follows the self-documented daily struggles of 10 individuals\n(7 paired teams in season 4) as they survive in the\n[wilderness](/wiki/Wilderness \"Wilderness\") for as long as possible using a\nlimited amount of survival equipment. With the exception of medical check-ins,\nthe participants are isolated from each other and all other humans. They may\n\"tap out\" at any time, or be removed due to failing a medical check-in. The\ncontestant (or team in Season 4) who remains the longest wins a grand prize of\n$500,000.\n\nThe series premiered on June 18, 2015. On August 19, before the finale of\nseason 1, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second\nseason, which would begin production in the fall of 2015 on Vancouver Island,\nCanada.[1] Season 2 premiered on April 21, 2016. Season 3 was filmed in the\nsecond quarter of 2016 in Patagonia, Argentina and premiered on December 8.[2]\nOne day before the season 3 premiere, History announced that casting had begun\nfor season 4.\n\nIn January 2017, a Danish version of the series premiered with the name _Alone\nin the Wilderness_ ([Danish](/wiki/Danish_language \"Danish language\"): _Alene\ni vildmarken_) on [DR3](/wiki/DR3 \"DR3\"). It featured ten contestants and was\nfilmed in [northern Norway](/wiki/Northern_Norway \"Northern Norway\").\nParticipants chose 12 items from a list of 18.[3]\n\nIn the fall of 2017, a Norwegian version aired with 10 contestants spread\naround a lake with fish. It was near the tree line, so the few, small, mostly\nbirch trees left few land resources. The last contestant tapped out after a\nlittle more than a month.\n\nThe fifth season premiered on June 7, 2018.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Format and rules\n    * 1.1 General rules - all seasons\n    * 1.2 Season 4\n    * 1.3 Season 5\n  * 2 Reception\n  * 3 Episodes\n  * 4 Series overview\n    * 4.1 Season 1\n      * 4.1.1 Location\n      * 4.1.2 Contestants\n    * 4.2 Season 2\n      * 4.2.1 Location\n      * 4.2.2 Contestants\n    * 4.3 Season 3\n      * 4.3.1 Location\n      * 4.3.2 Contestants\n    * 4.4 Season 4\n      * 4.4.1 Location\n      * 4.4.2 Contestants\n    * 4.5 Season 5\n      * 4.5.1 Location\n      * 4.5.2 Contestants\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Format and\nrules[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alone_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Format and rules\")]\n\n### General rules - all\nseasons[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alone_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: General rules - all seasons\")]\n\nContestants are dropped off in remote areas of Northern Vancouver Island\n(seasons 1-2,4), Patagonia (season 3) and Northern Mongolia (season 5), far\nenough apart to ensure that they will not come in contact with one another.[5]\nThe process begins in mid to late autumn; this adds time pressure to the\nsurvival experience as the approaching winter causes temperatures to drop and\nfood to become scarce. Although terrains may differ in each contestant's\nlocation, the drop-off zones are assessed in advance to ensure a similar\ndistribution of local resources is available to each contestant.\n\nContestants each select 10 items of survival gear from a pre-approved list of\n40, and are issued a kit of standard equipment, clothing and first\naid/emergency supplies.[6] They are also given a set of cameras to document\ntheir daily experiences and emotions. Attempting to live in the wild for as\nlong as possible, the contestants must find food, build shelters, and endure\nextreme isolation and psychological distress.\n\nContestants who wish to withdraw from the competition for any reason (referred\nto as \"tapping out\") may signal a rescue crew using a provided satellite\ntelephone. In addition, medical professionals conduct periodic health checks\non the contestants and may, at their discretion, disqualify and evacuate\nanyone they feel is unable to continue participating safely. The last\nremaining contestant wins a $500,000 cash prize.[5] Contestants are warned\nthat the show might last for up to a year.[7]\n\n### Season\n4[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alone_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Season 4\")]\n\nSeason 4 was also filmed in Northern Vancouver Island but included a team\ndynamic. Fourteen contestants, consisting of seven family-member pairs, were\nindividually dropped off in remote areas of Northern Vancouver Island. The two\nmembers of each team chose 10 items of survival gear to be equally divided\nbetween them. The team chose one member to be taken to a campsite; the other\nbegan approximately 10 mi (16.09 km) away and was required to hike to the\nsite, using only a [compass](/wiki/Compass \"Compass\") and\n[bearing](/wiki/Bearing_\\(navigation\\) \"Bearing \\(navigation\\)\") to find the\nway. Either member may tap out at any time, but doing so removed both of them\nfrom the competition; in addition, if either member of a team was medically\nevacuated, both were disqualified. The last remaining team won the $500,000\nprize.\n\n### Season\n5[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alone_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Season 5\")]\n\nSeason 5 contestants were selected from non-winning contestants from Seasons 1\nthrough 4. The rules were otherwise similar to Seasons 1 through 3.\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alone_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nThe series received positive reviews in its first season and outstanding\nreviews for its third season, and earned a respectable 2.5 million total\nviewers, placing it in the top three new nonfictional cable series of\n2015.[8][_[irrelevant citation](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\n##\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alone_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\nSee also: [List of Alone episodes](/wiki/List_of_Alone_episodes \"List of Alone\nepisodes\")\n\nSeason| Episodes| Originally aired  \n---|---|---  \nFirst aired| Last aired  \n| [1](/wiki/List_of_Alone_episodes#Season_1_\\(2015\\) \"List of Alone\nepisodes\")| 11| June 18, 2015 (2015-06-18)| August 27, 2015 (2015-08-27)  \n| [2](/wiki/List_of_Alone_episodes#Season_2_\\(2016\\) \"List of Alone\nepisodes\")| 13| April 21, 2016 (2016-04-21)| July 14, 2016 (2016-07-14)  \n| [3](/wiki/List_of_Alone_episodes#Season_3_\\(2016–17\\) \"List of Alone\nepisodes\")| 10| December 8, 2016 (2016-12-08)| February 9, 2017 (2017-02-09)  \n| [4](/wiki/List_of_Alone_episodes#Season_4_\\(2017\\) \"List of Alone\nepisodes\")| 11| June 15, 2017 (2017-06-15)| August 17, 2017 (2017-08-17)  \n| [5](/wiki/List_of_Alone_episodes#Season_5_\\(2018\\) \"List of Alone\nepisodes\")| 10| June 14, 2018 (2018-06-14)| August 16, 2018 (2018-08-16)  \n  \n## Series\noverview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alone_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Series overview\")]\n\n### Season\n1[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alone_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Season 1\")]\n\nThe first season premiered on June 18, 2015. It was won by Alan Kay, who lost\nover 60 pounds during the course of the season. His staple foods were limpets\nand seaweed. He also consumed mussels, crab, fish and slugs.[9] Lucas Miller\nenjoyed his time on the show and was selected based on his work as a\nwilderness therapist. His most difficult experience with the show was making\nhonest confessions to the camera.[10] Sam Larson described his time on the\nshow as \"playing in the woods\". He set a goal for himself to last 50 days.\nAfter he reached his goal, a large storm hit the island, which Larson\ndescribed as being larger than any he had seen and prompting his decision to\nleave the island. Larson said that the loneliness and solitude took the most\ntime to adjust to, and that his preparation for the show mostly consisted of\nmental preparation.[11]\n\n####\nLocation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alone_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Location\")]\n\n[![Quatsino is located in British\nColumbia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Canada_British_Columbia_location_map_2.svg/200px-\nCanada_British_Columbia_location_map_2.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Canada_British_Columbia_location_map_2.svg\n\"Quatsino is located in British Columbia\")\n\n![Quatsino](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/8px-\nRed_pog.svg.png)\n\nQuatsino\n\n[ ](/wiki/File:Canada_British_Columbia_location_map_2.svg \"File:Canada British\nColumbia location map 2.svg\")\n\nLocation of Quatsino in [British Columbia](/wiki/British_Columbia \"British\nColumbia\")\n\nThe season was shot in [Quatsino](/wiki/Quatsino \"Quatsino\") Territory,\nlocated near [Port Hardy, British Columbia](/wiki/Port_Hardy,_British_Columbia\n\"Port Hardy, British Columbia\").\n\nQuatsino is a [small hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet_\\(place\\) \"Hamlet \\(place\\)\") of 91\npeople located on [Quatsino Sound](/wiki/Quatsino_Sound \"Quatsino Sound\") in\n[Northern Vancouver Island, Canada](/wiki/Vancouver_Island \"Vancouver\nIsland\"), only accessible by boat or float plane.
