The book tells a Christmas-themed story, written in rhyme,\nthat explains how [Santa Claus](/wiki/Santa_Claus \"Santa Claus\") knows who is\nnaughty and who is nice. It describes elves visiting children between\n[Thanksgiving](/wiki/Thanksgiving \"Thanksgiving\") and [Christmas\nEve](/wiki/Christmas_Eve \"Christmas Eve\"), after which they return to the\n[North Pole](/wiki/North_Pole \"North Pole\") until the next holiday season.\n_The Elf on the Shelf_ comes in a [keepsake box](/wiki/Keepsake_box \"Keepsake\nbox\") that features a hardbound picture book and a small soft toy in the form\nof a [pixie](/wiki/Pixie \"Pixie\") scout elf.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 History\n    * 2.1 Mensch on a Bench\n  * 3 Criticism\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Plot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Elf_on_the_Shelf&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nThis story describes how Santa's \"scout [elves](/wiki/Elf \"Elf\")\" hide in\npeople's homes to watch over events. Once everyone goes to bed, the scout elf\nflies back to the [North Pole](/wiki/North_Pole \"North Pole\") to report to\nSanta the activities, good and bad, that have taken place throughout the day.\nBefore the family wakes up each morning, the scout elf flies back from the\nNorth Pole and hides. By hiding in a new spot each morning around the house,\nthe scout elf plays an ongoing game of [hide and seek](/wiki/Hide_and_seek\n\"Hide and seek\") with the family.\n\n_The Elf on the Shelf_ explains that scout elves get their magic by being\nnamed and being loved by a child. In the back of each book, families have an\nopportunity to write their elf's name and the date that they adopted it. Once\nthe elf is named, the scout elf receives its special Christmas magic, which\nallows it to fly to and from the North Pole.\n\nThe book tells how the magic might disappear if the scout elf is touched, so\nthe rule for _The Elf on the Shelf_ states, \"There's only one rule that you\nhave to follow, so I will come back and be here tomorrow: Please do not touch\nme. My magic might go, and Santa won't hear all I've seen or I know.\" Although\nfamilies are told not to touch their scout elf, they can speak to it and tell\nit all their Christmas wishes so that it can report back to Santa accurately.\n\nThe story ends on Christmas Day with the elf leaving to stay with Santa for\nthe rest of the year until the following Christmas season.\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Elf_on_the_Shelf&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n_The Elf on the Shelf_ was written in 2004 by Carol Aebersold and daughter\nChanda Bell over a cup of tea. Bell suggested they write a book about an old\ntradition of an elf sent from Santa who came to watch over them at Christmas\ntime. Aebersold's other daughter, Christa Pitts, was recruited by the family\nto share her expertise in sales and marketing. Together, the trio devoted the\nnext three years promoting their self-published book and attending book\nsignings and [trade shows](/wiki/Trade_show \"Trade show\").\n\n_The Elf on the Shelf_ won the Best Toy Award by [Learning\nExpress](/wiki/Learning_Express_Toys \"Learning Express Toys\"), won Book of the\nYear Award from Creative Child Awards and National Best Books Award sponsored\nby [USA Book News](/wiki/USA_Book_News \"USA Book News\") in 2008. In 2012, _The\nElf on the Shelf_ made its first appearance in the [Macy's Thanksgiving Day\nParade](/wiki/Macy%27s_Thanksgiving_Day_Parade \"Macy's Thanksgiving Day\nParade\") alongside fellow parade newcomers [Hello Kitty](/wiki/Hello_Kitty\n\"Hello Kitty\") and [Papa Smurf](/wiki/Papa_Smurf \"Papa Smurf\"). In 2013, _The\nElf on the Shelf_ hit the #1 spot on the USA Today Bestsellers List.[1]\n\nOn 26 November 2011, the book aired on [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") as a 30-minute\nanimated TV show, _An Elf 's Story: The Elf on the Shelf_, directed by Chad\nEikhoff.[2][3] _[The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The\nWashington Post\")_ criticized the quality of the animation and dismissed it as\n\"just a half-hour advertisement for a book and a toy\", which it felt would not\njoin \"the canon of prime-time animated Christmas specials that actually move\nthe spirit\".[3] [Common Sense Media](/wiki/Common_Sense_Media \"Common Sense\nMedia\") disagreed, calling the special \"a great addition to families' holiday\nTV traditions\";[4] however, they also warn parents about the consumer-driven\nnature of the story, and make note of its lack of educational value.\n\nIn October 2013, _The Elf on the Shelf: A Birthday Tradition_ was released.\nWritten and illustrated by the same team that created the first book, it\noffers instructions for inviting a scout elf to visit for a child's birthday\nparty and describes how the elf decorates a chair for the child.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\nApril 2014, two supplemental birthday products were released: The Elf on the\nShelf Birthday Countdown Game and The Elf on the Shelf Birthday Chair\nDecoration Kit.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n_The Elf on the Shelf_ was parodied as \"The Gnome in the Home\" in \"[The\nNightmare After Krustmas](/wiki/The_Nightmare_After_Krustmas \"The Nightmare\nAfter Krustmas\"),\" a 2016 episode of _[The Simpsons](/wiki/The_Simpsons \"The\nSimpsons\")_.\n\n### Mensch on a\nBench[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Elf_on_the_Shelf&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Mensch on a Bench\")]\n\nA Jewish counterpart to Elf On The Shelf was created: \"Mensch on a Bench,\" a\nstuffed toy that looks a bit like a [rabbi](/wiki/Rabbi \"Rabbi\") or a\n[Hasidic](/wiki/Hasidic \"Hasidic\") Jew.[5][6][7] Jewish father Neal Hoffman, a\nformer [Hasbro](/wiki/Hasbro \"Hasbro\") Toys toy marketing executive, raised\nmore than $20,000, using the [crowdfunding](/wiki/Crowdfunding \"Crowdfunding\")\nwebsite [Kickstarter](/wiki/Kickstarter \"Kickstarter\") to fund creation of the\ntoy in the Spring of 2011.[6][8][9][10] \"[Mensch](/wiki/Mensch \"Mensch\")\", in\n[Yiddish](/wiki/Yiddish \"Yiddish\"), means a person of integrity or\nhonor.[5][11][12]\n\n[Cody Decker](/wiki/Cody_Decker \"Cody Decker\"), the starting left fielder for\n[Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball\nClassic](/wiki/Israel_at_the_World_Baseball_Classic#2017_tournament \"Israel at\nthe World Baseball Classic\"), brought the team's mascot, a five-foot version\nof \"Mensch on a Bench,\" with him to Asia from the United States for the World\nBaseball Classic.[5][13][14] Decker said he \"tried getting him a first-class\nticket. But that didn’t fly, so he was put in a duffel bag and checked.\"[15]\nThe mascot proved to be a big hit.[5][13] He has his own locker, sits on Team\nIsrael's bench in the dugout during every game, and sat alongside Decker at a\npress conference in South Korea.[11][15][16] Decker said:\n\n> \"He’s a mascot, he’s a friend, he’s a teammate, he’s a borderline deity to\n> our team.... He brings a lot to the table.... Every team needs their\n> [Jobu](/wiki/Major_League_\\(film\\)#Jobu \"Major League \\(film\\)\"). He was\n> ours. He had his own locker, and we even gave him offerings:\n> [Manischewitz](/wiki/Manischewitz \"Manischewitz\"),\n> [gelt](/wiki/Hanukkah_gelt \"Hanukkah gelt\"), and [gefilte\n> fish](/wiki/Gefilte_fish \"Gefilte fish\")... He is everywhere and nowhere all\n> at once. His actual location is irrelevant because he exists in higher\n> metaphysical planes. But he’s always near.\"[11]\n\nTeam Israel Manager [Jerry Weinstein](/wiki/Jerry_Weinstein \"Jerry Weinstein\")\nsaid: \"He’s on the team. Everybody brings something to the team, and certainly\nThe Mensch is a unifying factor for the ball club.\"[5] Pitcher [Gabe\nCramer](/wiki/Gabe_Cramer \"Gabe Cramer\") said: \"The Mensch on a Bench is ... a\nsymbol we can rally around as a team. We are proud to be Jewish, but we know\nhow to make and take a joke, something Jews have a long history of doing. The\nMensch is a great way to have fun in the dugout while reminding us of why\nwe’re here and who we’re representing.\"[17]\n\n##\nCriticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Elf_on_the_Shelf&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Criticism\")]\n\nThe Elf has received some criticism from cultural reviewers. _[The\nAtlantic](/wiki/The_Atlantic \"The Atlantic\")_ columnist Kate Tuttle calls it\n\"a marketing juggernaut dressed up as a tradition\" whose purpose is \"to spy on\nkids\" and that one shouldn't \"bully your child into thinking that good\nbehavior equals gifts.\"[18] _Washington Post_ reviewer [Hank\nStuever](/wiki/Hank_Stuever \"Hank Stuever\") characterized the concept as \"just\nanother nannycam in a nanny state obsessed with penal codes\".[3] Writing for\n_[Psychology Today](/wiki/Psychology_Today \"Psychology Today\")_ , Dr. David\nKyle Johnston calls it a \"dangerous parental crutch\", with much the same\nreasoning as what he terms the \"[Santa\nlie](/wiki/Santa_Claus#Controversy_about_deceiving_children \"Santa\nClaus\")\".[19] Professor Laura Pinto suggests that it conditions kids to accept\nthe surveillance state and that it communicates to children that \"it's okay\nfor other people to spy on you, and you're not entitled to privacy.\"[20] She\nargues that \"if you grow up thinking it's cool for the elves to watch me and\nreport back to Santa, well, then it's cool for the\n[NSA](/wiki/National_Security_Agency \"National Security Agency\") to watch me\nand report back to the government ... The rule of play is that kids get to\ninteract with a doll or video game or what have you, but not so with the Elf\non the Shelf: The rule is that you don't touch the elf. Think about the\nmessage that sends.\"[21][22]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Elf_on_the_Shelf&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [[1]](http://www.courierislander.com/entertainment/usa-today-bestsellers-1.757134) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20140415040154/http://www.courierislander.com/entertainment/usa-today-bestsellers-1.757134) April 15, 2014, at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine \"Wayback Machine\").\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"An Elf's Story\"](http://www.elfontheshelf.com/content/elfs-story).
