        "# United States customary units\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**United States customary units** are a [system of\nmeasurements](/wiki/Units_of_measurement \"Units of measurement\") commonly used\nin the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"). The **United\nStates customary system** (**USCS** or **USC**) developed from [English\nunits](/wiki/English_units \"English units\") which were in use in the [British\nEmpire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") before the U.S. became an\nindependent country. However, the United Kingdom's system of measures was\noverhauled in 1824 to create the [imperial system](/wiki/Imperial_system\n\"Imperial system\"), changing the definitions of some units. Therefore, while\nmany U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts, there\nare significant [differences between the\nsystems](/wiki/Comparison_of_the_imperial_and_US_customary_measurement_systems\n\"Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems\"). However,\nin the U.S. the term \"imperial\" is sometimes used colloquially in reference to\nthe U.S. system.[1][_[verification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\nThe majority of U.S. customary units were redefined in terms of the\n[meter](/wiki/Metre \"Metre\") and the [kilogram](/wiki/Kilogram \"Kilogram\")\nwith the [Mendenhall Order](/wiki/Mendenhall_Order \"Mendenhall Order\") of 1893\nand, in practice, for many years before.[2] These definitions were refined by\nthe [international yard and pound](/wiki/International_yard_and_pound\n\"International yard and pound\") agreement of 1959.[3] Americans primarily use\ncustomary units in commercial activities, as well as for personal and social\nuse. In science, medicine, many sectors of industry and some of government and\nmilitary, metric units are used. The [International System of\nUnits](/wiki/International_System_of_Units \"International System of Units\")\n(SI), the modern form of the [metric system](/wiki/Metric_system \"Metric\nsystem\"), is preferred for many uses by the U.S. [National Institute of\nStandards and Technology](/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology\n\"National Institute of Standards and Technology\") (NIST).[4] For newer units\nof measure where there is no traditional customary unit, international units\nare used, sometimes mixed with customary units, such as [electrical\nresistance](/wiki/Electrical_resistance \"Electrical resistance\") of wire\nexpressed in [ohms](/wiki/Ohm \"Ohm\") (SI) per thousand feet.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Units of length\n  * 3 Units of area\n  * 4 Units of capacity and volume\n    * 4.1 Fluid volume\n    * 4.2 Dry volume\n  * 5 Units of weight\n    * 5.1 Grain measures\n  * 6 Cooking measures\n  * 7 Units of temperature\n  * 8 Other units\n  * 9 Other names for U.S. customary units\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_customary_units&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nSee also: [Imperial and US customary measurement\nsystems](/wiki/Imperial_and_US_customary_measurement_systems \"Imperial and US\ncustomary measurement systems\") and [Comparison of the imperial and US\ncustomary measurement\nsystems](/wiki/Comparison_of_the_imperial_and_US_customary_measurement_systems\n\"Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems\")\n\nThe United States system of units is similar to the British [imperial\nsystem](/wiki/Imperial_units \"Imperial units\").[5] Both systems are derived\nfrom [English units](/wiki/English_units \"English units\"), a system which had\nevolved over the millennia before American independence, and which had its\nroots in Roman and Anglo-Saxon units.\n\nThe customary system was championed by the U.S.-based International Institute\nfor Preserving and Perfecting Weights and Measures in the late 19th century.\nAdvocates of the customary system saw the French Revolutionary, or metric,\nsystem as atheistic.[6] An auxiliary of the Institute in Ohio published a poem\nwith wording such as \"down with every 'metric' scheme\" and \"A perfect inch, a\nperfect pint\".[6] One adherent of the customary system called it \"a just\nweight and a just measure, which alone are acceptable to the Lord.\"[6]\n\nThe U.S. government passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which made the\n[metric system](/wiki/Metric_system \"Metric system\") \"the preferred system of\nweights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce.\" The legislation states that\nthe federal government has a responsibility to assist industry as it\n_voluntarily_ converts to the metric system, i.e.,\n[metrification](/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_States \"Metrication in the\nUnited States\"). This is most evident in U.S. labeling requirements on food\nproducts, where SI units are almost always presented alongside customary\nunits. According to the [CIA Factbook](/wiki/CIA_Factbook \"CIA Factbook\"), the\nUnited States is one of three nations (along with [Liberia](/wiki/Liberia\n\"Liberia\") and [Burma](/wiki/Burma \"Burma\")) that have not adopted the metric\nsystem as their official system of weights and measures.[7]\n\nU.S. customary units are widely used on consumer products and in industrial\nmanufacturing. Metric units are standard in science, medicine, as well as many\nsectors of industry and government, including the\n[military](/wiki/U.S._armed_forces \"U.S. armed forces\").[7] There are\nanecdotal objections to the use of metric units in carpentry and the building\ntrades, on the basis that it is easier to remember an integer number of inches\nplus a fraction than a measurement in millimeters,[8] or that foot-inch\nmeasurements are more suitable when distances are frequently divided into\nhalves, thirds and quarters, often in parallel. The metric system also lacks a\nparallel to the foot.[9]\n\nOther nations had, or still have unofficially, customary units of their own,\nsometimes very similar in name and measure to U.S. customary units, since they\noften share the same Germanic or Roman origins. Frequently, however, these\nunits designate quite different sizes. For example, the [mile](/wiki/Mile\n\"Mile\") ranged by country from one-half to five U.S. miles;\n[foot](/wiki/Foot_\\(length\\) \"Foot \\(length\\)\") and\n[pound](/wiki/Pound_\\(mass\\) \"Pound \\(mass\\)\") also had varying definitions.\nHistorically, a wide range of non-SI units were used in the U.S. and in\nBritain, but many have fallen into disuse.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] This\narticle deals only with the units commonly used or officially defined in the\nU.S.\n\n## Units of\nlength[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_customary_units&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Units of length\")]\n\nUnit | Divisions | SI equivalent  \n---|---|---  \nExact relationships shown in **boldface**  \nInternational  \n1 [_point_](/wiki/Point_\\(typography\\) \"Point \\(typography\\)\") (p) |  | **​ 127⁄360 mm** or 6996352778000000000♠352.778 μm  \n1 [_pica_](/wiki/Pica_\\(typography\\) \"Pica \\(typography\\)\") (P̸) | **12 p** | **​ 127⁄30 mm** or 6997423300000000000♠4.233 mm  \n1 _[inch](/wiki/Inch \"Inch\")_ (in or \") | **6 P̸** | **25.4 mm**  \n1 _[foot](/wiki/Foot_\\(length\\) \"Foot \\(length\\)\")_ (ft or ') | **12 in** | **6999304800000000000♠ 0.3048 m**[10]  \n1 _[yard](/wiki/Yard \"Yard\")_ (yd) | **3 ft** | **6999914400000000000♠ 0.9144 m**[10]  \n1 _[mile](/wiki/Mile \"Mile\")_ (mi) | **7003160934400000000♠ 5280 ft** or **7003160934400000000♠ 1760 yd** | **7003160934400000000♠ 1.609344 km**  \nUS Survey  \n1 [link](/wiki/Link_\\(unit\\) \"Link \\(unit\\)\") (li) | **​ 33⁄50 ft** or **7.92 in** | **​ 792⁄3937 m** or 6999201170000000000♠20.117 cm  \n1 (survey) [foot](/wiki/Foot_\\(length\\) \"Foot \\(length\\)\") (ft) |  | **​ 1200⁄3937 m** or 6999304800000000000♠30.480 cm[10]  \n1 [rod](/wiki/Rod_\\(unit\\) \"Rod \\(unit\\)\") (rd) | **25 li** or **16.5 ft** | **​ 19,800⁄3937 m** or 7000502900000000000♠5.029 m  \n1 [chain](/wiki/Chain_\\(unit\\) \"Chain \\(unit\\)\") (ch) | **4 rd** or **66 ft** | **​ 79,200⁄3937 m** or 7001201160000000000♠20.116 m  \n1 [furlong](/wiki/Furlong \"Furlong\") (fur) | **10 ch** | **​ 792⁄3937 km** or 7002201168000000000♠201.168 m  \n1 survey (or statute) [mile](/wiki/Mile \"Mile\") (mi) | **8 fur** | **​ 6336⁄3937 km** or 7003160934700000000♠1.609347 km[10]  \n1 [league](/wiki/League_\\(unit\\) \"League \\(unit\\)\") (lea) | **3 mi** | **​ 19,008⁄3937 km** or 7003482800000000000♠4.828 km  \nInternational Nautical[10]  \n1 [fathom](/wiki/Fathom \"Fathom\") (ftm) | **2 yd** | **7000182880000000000♠ 1.8288 m**  \n1 [cable](/wiki/Cable_\\(unit\\) \"Cable \\(unit\\)\") (cb) | **120 ftm** or 1.091 fur | **7002219456000000000♠ 219.456 m**  \n1 [nautical mile](/wiki/Nautical_mile \"Nautical mile\") (NM or nmi) | 8.439 cb or 1.151 mi | **1.852 km**  \n  \nFor measuring length, the U.S. customary system uses the [inch](/wiki/Inch\n\"Inch\"), [foot](/wiki/Foot_\\(length\\) \"Foot \\(length\\)\"), [yard](/wiki/Yard\n\"Yard\"), and [mile](/wiki/Mile \"Mile\"), which are the only four customary\nlength measurements in everyday use. Since July 1, 1959, these have been\ndefined on the basis of 1 yard = 0.9144 meters except for some applications in\nsurveying.[3] The U.S., the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United\nKingdom\") and other [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations \"Commonwealth\nof Nations\") countries agreed on this definition, and so it is often termed\n_international measure_.\n\nWhen international measure was introduced in the English-speaking countries,\nthe basic [geodetic datum](/wiki/Geodetic_datum \"Geodetic datum\") in North\nAmerica was the [North American Datum](/wiki/North_American_Datum \"North\nAmerican Datum\") of 1927 (NAD27), which had been constructed by\n[triangulation](/wiki/Triangulation \"Triangulation\") based on the definition\nof the foot in the [Mendenhall Order](/wiki/Mendenhall_Order \"Mendenhall\nOrder\") of 1893, that is 1 foot = ​1200⁄3937 meters: this definition was\nretained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the _US survey foot_ to\ndistinguish it from the international foot.[3] For most applications, the\ndifference between the two definitions is insignificant – one international\nfoot is exactly 0.999998 of a US survey foot, for a difference of about ​1⁄8\ninch (3 mm) per mile – but it affects the definition of the [State Plane\nCoordinate Systems](/wiki/State_Plane_Coordinate_System \"State Plane\nCoordinate System\") (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles.[11]\n\nThe NAD27 was replaced in the 1980s by the North American Datum of 1983\n(NAD83), which is defined in meters. The SPCSs were also updated, but the\n[National Geodetic Survey](/wiki/National_Geodetic_Survey \"National Geodetic\nSurvey\") left the decision of which (if any) definition of the foot to use to\nthe individual states. All SPCSs are defined in meters, but seven states also\nhave SPCSs defined in US survey feet and an eighth state in international\nfeet: the other 42 states use only meter-based SPCSs.[11]\n\nState legislation is also important for determining the conversion factor to\nbe used for everyday land surveying and real estate transactions, although the\ndifference (2 [ppm](/wiki/Parts_per_million \"Parts per million\")) is of no\npractical significance given the precision of normal surveying measurements\nover short distances (usually much less than a mile). Twenty-four states have\nlegislated that surveying measures should be based on the US survey foot,\neight have legislated that they be made on the basis of the international\nfoot, and eighteen have not specified the conversion factor from metric\nunits.[11]\n\n## Units of\narea[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_customary_units&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Units of area\")]\n\nUnit | Divisions | SI equivalent  \n---|---|---  \nExact relationships shown in **boldface**  \n1 square survey foot (sq ft or ft2) | 144 square inches | 6998929034100000000♠0.09290341 m2  \n1 square chain (sq ch or ch2) | **7003435600000000000♠ 4356 sq ft (survey)** or **16 sq rods** | 7002404687300000000♠404.6873 m2  \n1 [acre](/wiki/Acre \"Acre\") | **7004435600000000000♠ 43560 sq ft (survey)** or **10 sq ch** | 7003404687300000000♠4046.873 m2  \n1 [section](/wiki/Section_\\(United_States_land_surveying\\) \"Section \\(United States land surveying\\)\") | **640 acres** or **1[sq mile](/wiki/Square_mile \"Square mile\") (survey)** | 7006258999800000000♠2.589998 km2  \n1 [survey township](/wiki/Survey_township \"Survey township\") (twp) | **36 sections** or **4 sq leagues** | 7007932399300000000♠93.23993 km2  \n  \nThe most widely used area unit with a name unrelated to any length unit is the\n[acre](/wiki/Acre \"Acre\").

Of these, the avoirdupois\nweight is the most common system used in the U.S., although Troy weight is\nstill used to weigh precious metals. Apothecaries weight—once used by\npharmacies—has been largely replaced by metric measurements. Tower weight fell\nout of use in England (due to legal prohibition in 1527) centuries ago, and\nwas never used in the U.S. The [imperial](/wiki/Imperial_units \"Imperial\nunits\") system, which is still used for some measures in the United Kingdom\nand other Commonwealth countries, is based on avoirdupois, with variations\nfrom U.S. customary units larger than a pound.\n\nThe pound avoirdupois, which forms the basis of the U.S. customary system of\nmass, is defined as exactly 7002453592370000000♠453.59237 [grams](/wiki/Gram\n\"Gram\") by agreement between the U.S., the United Kingdom, and other English-\nspeaking countries in 1959. Other units of mass are defined in terms of it.\n\nThe avoirdupois pound is legally defined as a measure of [mass](/wiki/Mass\n\"Mass\"),[17] but the name pound is also applied to measures of\n[force](/wiki/Force_\\(physics\\) \"Force \\(physics\\)\"). For instance, in many\ncontexts, the [pound](/wiki/Pound_\\(mass\\) \"Pound \\(mass\\)\") avoirdupois is\nused as a unit of mass, but in some contexts, the term \"pound\" is used to\nrefer to \"[pound-force](/wiki/Pound-force \"Pound-force\")\". The\n[slug](/wiki/Slug_\\(unit\\) \"Slug \\(unit\\)\") is another unit of mass derived\nfrom pound-force.\n\nTroy weight, avoirdupois weight, and apothecaries' weight are all built from\nthe same basic unit, the grain, which is the same in all three systems.\nHowever, while each system has some overlap in the names of their units of\nmeasure (all have ounces and pounds), the relationship between the grain and\nthese other units within each system varies. For example, in apothecary and\ntroy weight, the pound and ounce are the same, but are different from the\npound and ounce in avoirdupois in terms of their relationships to grains and\nto each other. The systems also have different units between the grain and\nounce (apothecaries' has scruple and [dram](/wiki/Dram_\\(unit\\) \"Dram\n\\(unit\\)\"), troy has [pennyweight](/wiki/Pennyweight \"Pennyweight\"), and\navoirdupois has just dram, sometimes spelled _drachm_). The dram in\navoirdupois weighs just under half of the dram in apothecaries'. The [fluid\ndram](/wiki/Fluid_dram \"Fluid dram\") unit of volume is based on the weight of\n1 dram of water in the apothecaries' system.\n\nTo alleviate confusion, it is typical when publishing non-avoirdupois weights\nto mention the name of the system along with the unit. Precious metals, for\nexample, are often weighed in \"troy ounces\", because just \"ounce\" would be\nmore likely to be assumed to mean an avoirdupois ounce.\n\nFor the pound and smaller units, the U.S. customary system and the British\nimperial system are identical. However, they differ when dealing with units\nlarger than the pound. The definition of the pound avoirdupois in the imperial\nsystem is identical to that in the U.S. customary system.\n\nIn the U.S., only the ounce, pound and short ton – known in the country simply\nas the ton – are commonly used, though the hundredweight is still used in\nagriculture and shipping. The grain is used to describe the mass of propellant\nand projectiles in small arms [ammunition](/wiki/Ammunition \"Ammunition\"). It\nwas also used to measure medicine and other very small masses.\n\n### Grain\nmeasures[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_customary_units&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Grain measures\")]\n\nIn agricultural practice, a [bushel](/wiki/Bushel \"Bushel\") is a fixed volume\nof 2150.42 cubic inches. The mass of grain will therefore vary according to\ndensity. Some nominal weight examples are:-[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n  * 1 bushel (corn) = 56 lb = 25.4012 kg\n  * 1 bushel (wheat) = 60 lb = 27.2155 kg\n  * 1 bushel (barley) = 48 lb = 21.7724 kg\n\nIn trade terms a bushel is a term used to refer to these nominal weights,\nalthough even this varies. With oats, Canada uses 34 lb bushels and the USA\nuses 32 lb bushels.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Cooking\nmeasures[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_customary_units&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Cooking measures\")]\n\nMain article: [Cooking weights and\nmeasures](/wiki/Cooking_weights_and_measures \"Cooking weights and measures\")\n\nCommon volume measures in English-speaking countries  \n(Comparable measures listed for comparison purposes.)
