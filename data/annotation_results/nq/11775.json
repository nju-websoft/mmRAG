In September 2013, it was\nreported that [Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting Company\")\nwas developing a TV series centered on James Gordon's early days as a police\ndetective and the origin stories of various [Batman\nvillains](/wiki/List_of_Batman_Family_adversaries \"List of Batman Family\nadversaries\"). In February 2014, McKenzie was cast as the lead character. When\ndescribing his character in an interview, McKenzie stated that Gordon \"is a\ntruly honest man. The last honest man in a city full of crooked people. He's\nnot an anti-hero, he’s a true hero – but he will have to compromise. McKenzie\ndid not audition for the role. Heller, with whom he had worked before, wrote\nthe role for McKenzie, who described the character as \"an old-fashioned hero\nin an age of anti-heroes. A throwback. Jim's a lawman, that restricts him in\nsome ways. But also means he can become powerful within the system and change\nthings for the better\".[2][3][4] After the conflict with Hugo Strange at\nArkham Asylum, Gordon left Gotham to find Leslie Thompkins, who had left\nGotham.[5] However, Gordon later discovered that she was in a new relationship\nwith Mario Calvi, discouraging him from pursuing her. Six months later, Gordon\nis working as a bounty hunter, forming an uneasy alliance with reporter\nValerie Vale. After experiencing a hallucination of his father, Gordon decides\nto rejoin the department. After Mario is infected by Alice Tetch's poisonous\nblood, Mario manipulates Lee into turning against Gordon. Before Mario can\nkill Lee, Gordon kills him in self-defense. This destroys any relationship Jim\nor Lee ever had. As his career goes on, Jim finds out his father and Uncle\nFrank were members of the Court of Owls. After Frank reveals he killed\nGordon's father to prevent him from spreading info about the Court, Frank\ncommits suicide, but not before telling Gordon that he must join the Court.\nGordon takes the blame for Frank's death and meets with the Court. After\nsaving some of his fellow police officers and some of Oswald Cobblepot's men\nfrom Professor Pyg, Jim Gordon is promoted to captain by Mayor Burke.  \n[Harvey Bullock](/wiki/Harvey_Bullock_\\(comics\\) \"Harvey Bullock \\(comics\\)\") | [Donal Logue](/wiki/Donal_Logue \"Donal Logue\") | 1–present | – | –  \n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Donal_Logue_at_NY_PaleyFest_2014_for_Gotham.jpg/170px-\nDonal_Logue_at_NY_PaleyFest_2014_for_Gotham.jpg)](/wiki/File:Donal_Logue_at_NY_PaleyFest_2014_for_Gotham.jpg)\n[](/wiki/File:Donal_Logue_at_NY_PaleyFest_2014_for_Gotham.jpg \"Enlarge\") Donal\nLogue Harvey Bullock is a detective who is Gordon's loyal partner and ally.\nBullock is a seemingly corrupt and brutish detective who has gradually become\nloyal to Jim Gordon.[6] At the beginning of the second season, Bullock resigns\nfrom the police force but rejoins following the Maniax attack on the GCPD.\nAfter Gordon is framed for the murder of Carl Pinkney, Bullock enlists Carmine\nFalcone to help break Jim out of prison. After Captain Barnes is hospitalized\nafter an attack by Azrael, Harvey is declared the de facto Captain until\nfurther notice and is trusted by Jim to protect Gotham after new threats\nemerge while he is away.[7] Six months later, Harvey is working with Barnes to\nprotect Gotham and while Jim refuses to return to the department, Harvey vows\nto never turn his back on him. When Nathaniel Barnes gets infected with the\nAlice Tetch virus and is remanded to Arkham Asylum, Harvey becomes the acting\ncaptain. In light of being promoted to captain by Mayor Burke after saving\nsome police officers and some of Oswald Cobblepot's men from Professor Pyg's\ntrap, Gordon reluctantly relieves Bullock of his position of acting captain.  \n[Bruce Wayne](/wiki/Bruce_Wayne_\\(Gotham\\) \"Bruce Wayne \\(Gotham\\)\") | [David Mazouz](/wiki/David_Mazouz \"David Mazouz\") | 1–present | – | –  \n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/David_Mazouz_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/170px-\nDavid_Mazouz_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg)](/wiki/File:David_Mazouz_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg)\n[](/wiki/File:David_Mazouz_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg \"Enlarge\") David Mazouz Bruce\nWayne is the orphaned son of Thomas and Martha Wayne, who is under the care of\nAlfred Pennyworth.

After he\nis discovered to be an [informant](/wiki/Informant \"Informant\") for the GCPD,\nhe is brutally beaten, leaving him with an odd way of walking furthering his\nnickname \"Penguin\". He escapes an attempt on his life, collaborating with Don\nFalcone when Gordon deliberately misfires at the pier where Oswald has been\nsent for execution. After a stint in the Maroni crime family as a restaurant\nmanager, he convinces Maroni of his loyalty, even setting up a robbery by some\nactors in which he feigns heroism to show his devotion. He later kills the\nthree actors with poisoned cannolis and presumably keeps the stolen cash they\nhad on them. Oswald later assumes Mooney's position in the Falcone crime\nfamily when Mooney's plot against the Don is uncovered. At the end of season\none, Oswald is Gotham City's sole remaining mob boss, with all of his rivals\neither dead, missing, or having fled Gotham.[11][12] Theo Galavan and Tabitha\nkidnap his mother, forcing him to help them. After they kill her, Oswald\nswears revenge and is later wounded during an attack on an event where Theo is\nholding his victory party for his election. After recuperating at Edward\nNygma's place, he and Gabe follow Theo Galavan's henchmen where they save Jim\nGordon from him. After the battle against the Saint Dumas, Oswald knocks out\nNathaniel Barnes and convinces Gordon that Theo may never be convicted and\nmust be killed. He and Jim then take Galavan to an isolated area, and Oswald\nmercilessly beats Galavan for killing his mother, before Gordon finishes Theo\noff with a gunshot. After Theo's death, Oswald's men abandon him, and he is\nlater found and arrested by the GCPD. After telling Barnes he's \"insane,\"\nOswald is taken to Arkham Asylum, where he meets Hugo Strange. After noticing\nand asking a fellow inmate at Arkham, he later finds out that he is to be\nexperimented on. Following some experiments, Oswald is released from Arkham.\nHe later meets his biological father Elijah Van Dahl when at his mother's\ngrave. After his step-family murders Elijah to gain the family's fortune,\nOswald awakens from his condition and slaughters his step-family in vengeance.\nAfter finding out that Azrael happens to be the resurrected Theo Galavan,\nOswald and Butch kill Galavan with an RPG. After finding out about Hugo\nStrange's experiments, Oswald, Butch, and his gang knock down the bus\nsupposedly containing Strange, but a shocked Oswald is knocked out by a\nresurrected Fish Mooney, prompting Butch and the gang to flee. The third\nseason of Gotham explores Oswald's continued struggle against the monsters, a\nfinal confrontation with Fish Mooney, and his rise and fall as Mayor of\nGotham. After working with Edward Nygma to get into office, Oswald develops\nromantic feelings for him, resulting in consequences within the political and\ncriminal worlds of the city. After his downfall, Oswald forms an alliance with\nIvy Pepper and exacts revenge on those who betrayed him. Upon establishing the\nPax Penguina where criminals can get a license from him to commit a crime,\nOswald Cobblepot has his encounter with Sofia Falcone.

She was incarcerated in Arkham Asylum until she is\namong those sprung from Arkham Asylum by Tabitha Galavan on her brother Theo's\norders.

He initially starts off as an awkward but\nintelligent man with an unrequited crush on archivist Kristen Kringle, but\nover the course of the show, transforms into a murderous and manipulative\ncriminal. After being constantly mistreated by his fellow co-workers (except\nBullock and Gordon, who tolerate him), Nygma murdered a fellow officer, Tom,\nwho was also Kringle's abusive boyfriend causing a mental breakdown that\nresults in a second personality.[14] He succeeded in becoming Kristen's\nboyfriend, however he was dumped after he told Kristen about having killed her\nabusive ex-boyfriend, Tom. When Edward tries to stop her from calling the\npolice, he accidentally chokes her to death. Edward starts to give in to his\n[narcissistic](/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder \"Narcissistic\npersonality disorder\") dark side. While burying her body in the woods, a\npasserby approaches and interferes. Nygma kills him as well and has to bury\nboth bodies. After helping Cobblepot recuperate, Nygma allows Cobblepot to\nlive with him while helping to heal Gordon after he was beaten up by Theo\nGalavan. Nygma later figures out Gordon's hand in Theo Galavan's death and\norchestrates his arrest by framing him for the death of Carl Pinkney. During\nthe confrontation with Gordon at the spot where Kristin Kringle was buried,\nNygma's plot was exposed thanks to Gordon's plan by getting him to confess his\nactions with Nathaniel Barnes and the other police officers nearby. Nygma is\narrested by the police and remanded to Arkham Asylum. After he investigates\nand finds out who Hugo Strange is and his experiments, Nygma escapes but is\ncaught and recaptured after a brief encounter with Selina. He later aids Hugo\nStrange in interrogating Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox but was re-incarcerated\nafterwards. Six months later, Penguin has him declared sane and has him\nreleased from Arkham Asylum so that he can help Penguin become mayor. Later,\nNygma buys back the money that Butch was bribing people with in order to vote\nfor Penguin. However, Penguin still wins regardless, proving Nygma's point\nthat the people of Gotham loved Penguin anyway. Later, Nygma meets and becomes\ninfatuated with a woman striking the resemblance to Kringle and also likes\nriddles, Isabella. After forming a relationship with Isabella, Penguin orders\nGabriel to cut the brakes off of Isabella's car, killing her. After Nygma is\ninformed by Barbara of Penguin's romantic feelings for him, Nygma discovers\nthat Penguin indeed killed Isabella. Later, Nygma forms a partnership with\nBarbara, Tabitha, and Butch to destroy everything Penguin loves. After\nbreaking his sanity and destroying his reputation, Nygma shoots Penguin in the\nharbour docks, although Penguin claims to love Nygma still. Nygma later starts\na killing spree of those who can't solve his riddles and even gets Lucius Fox\ninvolved. Taking pills that cause him to have tormenting hallucinations of\nPenguin, Nygma admits that he can't do everything without Penguin. Later,\nNygma throws the pills away, and finally embraces his new role as \"The\nRiddler.\" In order to get the Court of Owls to reveal themselves, Riddler\ntakes Mayor Aubrey James captive. Meeting with Gordon at the police station,\nRiddler agrees to Gordon's terms to accompany him. When on a road, Riddler\nagrees to go along with Kathryn and the Talon after Kathryn referenced the\nfact that Hugo Strange left Riddler's \"who actually runs Gotham\" question. As\nthe Talon loads Nygma into the car, Kathryn tells Gordon that they'll find a\nuse for Riddler before departing. Nygma later discovered that Oswald Cobblepot\nis his neighbouring prisoner.

Riddler is later\nfreed by a woman named Myrtle Jenkins who tries to get him back to good health\nand remember the classic riddles. After hitting Myrtle with the riddle book\nfor children, Riddler leaves her apartment and heads out to plan revenge on\nOswald Cobblepot. Due to his brain still recovering from the ice, Riddler was\nunable to do his usual riddles on Oswald Cobblepot who ended up sparing\nRiddler from Victor Fries. Riddler later encountered Butch Gilzean in his new\nform of Solomon Grundy. As they work to recover their minds, they go to\nCherry's fight club where Riddler persuades Cherry to let him fight there.\nWhen Selina Kyle manages to catch Edward Nygma while Barbara Kean and Tabitha\nGalavan were busy with their side-agendas, Leslie Thompkins suggested a \"Code\nof the Narrows\" to pit the champions of both sides against each other for the\nfate of Edward Nygma. When Firefly crashes the fight to finish the job that\nOswald Cobblepot gave her, Riddler witnessed Leslie disabling Firefly and\nBarbara shooting Cherry. While Solomon Grundy was having his wounds tended to,\nNygma suggests to Leslie that she takes the position that Cherry had. Leslie\nlater figures out that Nygma's error of not doing his usual problems was a\npsychological error. The Riddler persona soon returns to cause problems for\nNygma and he eventually resorts to attempting suicide by hanging before opting\nto return to Arkham.

Those\nDumas who remained in Gotham changed their surname to Galavan. Theo starts his\ncampaign by orchestrating the abduction of Mayor Aubrey James. As the Chairman\nof the Gotham Chamber of Commerce, he oversaw Gillian Loeb's resignation as\npolice commissioner and Sarah Essen being sworn in as the new police\ncommissioner. Using Zaardon the Soul Reaper, Theo has Tabitha spring Jerome\nValeska, Barbara Kean, Aaron Helzinger, Richard Sionis, Robert Greenwood, and\nArnold Dobkins from Arkham Asylum to assist him. Sionis was the only one who\ndeclined and he had Tabitha kill him to serve as a warning to the others. Theo\nposes as a caring father figure to Bruce Wayne after ostensibly saving him\nfrom Jerome Valeska during a hostage crisis. With Mayor James still missing\nand Deputy Mayor Harrison Kane dead, Theo then exhorts Oswald Cobblepot into\ntargeting the mayoral candidates by holding Oswald's mother Gertrud hostage\nwhile acting like he missed Galavan. While Oswald was successful at killing\nJanice Caulfield, Victor Zsasz fails at kidnapping Randall Hobbs who drops out\nof the race. As the only remaining candidate, Theo wins the election, but his\ntrue goal is to avenge the Dumas family against the Wayne family. After\nTabitha killed Gertrud, Oswald swore revenge on Theo which led to a fight\nbetween Cobblepot's group and the police which ended with Oswald getting\nwounded and Gordon getting suspicious. He is later arrested by Jim Gordon\nafter Mayor James is found alive following Barbara Kean ending up\nhospitalized. While Gordon and Barnes were searching Galavan's apartment, they\ndid find a cassock behind one of the paintings where they assumed that Galavan\nhad some religious connections. While awaiting trial, Theo reprimanded Tabitha\nfor acting out against his orders and states that his next plan is in motion.\nWhen it came to the trial, Mayor James testifies in court that it was Oswald\nCobblepot who abducted him. The judge drops the case against Theo whose\nhenchmen, posing as police officers, abduct Gordon while he was being taken\nout of the courthouse. With Gordon in his clutches, Galavan stated that the\nOrder of St Dumas protected his family and that his real surname is Dumas.\nGalavan toys with Gordon but quickly overpowers him, using some martial arts\nskills which Theo not previously displayed. He orders his henchmen to kill\nGordon slowly and leaves to claim Bruce Wayne's life. During the final battle\nat Galavan's tower, Tabitha tells Theo he has lost and she is going to look\nout for herself, saving Silver and Bruce Wayne, as Gordon and Penguin come to\nthe rescue, albeit for very different reasons. Gordon and Cobblepot take him\nto an isolated place outside Gotham where Cobblepot beats him mercilessly\nuntil Gordon stops him and shoots Galavan dead. Cobblepot puts an umbrella in\nthe corpse's mouth to make it look like that he killed Galavan. Galavan's body\nis then taken to the underground Indian Hill facility. As Patient 44, he is\nsuccessfully resurrected by the Indian Hill facility's doctors but the shock\nof the process scrambled his memories. Strange, inspired by Nygma, misleads\nGalavan to believe himself to be the order's legendary knight Azrael before\nsending him after Gordon. When it came to the fight at the Gotham City Police\nDepartment, Theo was unmasked upon his helm being knocked off by Nathaniel\nBarnes. He manages to use the broken part of the fake Sword of Sin to stab\nNathaniel Barnes. As he makes his escape, his face was shown to the reporters\nas Oswald Cobblepot, Tabitha Galavan, and Bruce Wayne sees it on the news.\nTheo then began to look for the real Sword of Sin where he confronted Gordon\nand Bullock at a crypt which ends with Tabitha ending up hospitalised.
