He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and\ncartoonist for _[Vanity Fair](/wiki/Vanity_Fair_\\(magazine\\) \"Vanity Fair\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ , _[Life](/wiki/Life_\\(magazine\\) \"Life \\(magazine\\)\")_ , and\nvarious other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for [advertising\ncampaigns](/wiki/Advertising_campaign \"Advertising campaign\"), most notably\nfor [FLIT](/wiki/FLIT \"FLIT\") and [Standard Oil](/wiki/Standard_Oil \"Standard\nOil\"), and as a [political cartoonist](/wiki/Editorial_cartoon \"Editorial\ncartoon\") for the New York newspaper _[PM](/wiki/PM_\\(newspaper\\) \"PM\n\\(newspaper\\)\")_. He published his first children's book _[And to Think That I\nSaw It on Mulberry Street](/wiki/And_to_Think_That_I_Saw_It_on_Mulberry_Street\n\"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street\")_ in 1937. During [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), he took a brief hiatus from children's\nliterature and worked in an animation department of the [United States\nArmy](/wiki/United_States_Army \"United States Army\") where he produced several\nshort films, including _[Design for Death](/wiki/Design_for_Death \"Design for\nDeath\")_ , which later won the 1947 [Academy Award for Best Documentary\nFeature](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Documentary_Feature \"Academy Award for\nBest Documentary Feature\").[4]\n\nAfter the war, Geisel focused on children's books once again, writing classics\nlike _[If I Ran the Zoo](/wiki/If_I_Ran_the_Zoo \"If I Ran the Zoo\")_ (1950),\n_[Horton Hears a Who!](/wiki/Horton_Hears_a_Who! \"Horton Hears a Who!\")_\n(1955), _[If I Ran the Circus](/wiki/If_I_Ran_the_Circus \"If I Ran the\nCircus\")_ (1956), _[The Cat in the Hat](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Cat in\nthe Hat\")_ (1957), _[How the Grinch Stole\nChristmas!](/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas! \"How the Grinch Stole\nChristmas!\")_ (1957), and _[Green Eggs and Ham](/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham\n\"Green Eggs and Ham\")_ (1960). He published over 60 books during his career,\nwhich have spawned numerous [adaptations](/wiki/Film_adaptation \"Film\nadaptation\"), including 11 television specials, four feature films, [a\nBroadway musical](/wiki/Seussical \"Seussical\"), and four television series.\n\nGeisel won the [Lewis Carroll Shelf Award](/wiki/Lewis_Carroll_Shelf_Award\n\"Lewis Carroll Shelf Award\") in 1958 for _Horton Hatches the Egg_ and again in\n1961 for _And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street_.

Denison\")[8] after the brewery closed\nbecause of [Prohibition](/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States \"Prohibition\nin the United States\").[9] [Mulberry\nStreet](/wiki/Mulberry_Street_\\(Springfield,_Massachusetts\\) \"Mulberry Street\n\\(Springfield, Massachusetts\\)\") in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss'\nfirst children's book _[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry\nStreet](/wiki/And_to_Think_That_I_Saw_It_on_Mulberry_Street \"And to Think That\nI Saw It on Mulberry Street\")_ , is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood\nhome on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a [Lutheran](/wiki/V \"V\").[10] He\nenrolled at [Springfield Central High\nSchool](/wiki/Springfield_Central_High_School \"Springfield Central High\nSchool\") in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and\nlater became manager of the school soccer team.[11]\n\nGeisel attended [Dartmouth College](/wiki/Dartmouth_College \"Dartmouth\nCollege\"), graduating in 1925.[12] At Dartmouth, he joined the [Sigma Phi\nEpsilon](/wiki/Sigma_Phi_Epsilon \"Sigma Phi Epsilon\") fraternity[5] and the\nhumor magazine _[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern](/wiki/Dartmouth_Jack-O-Lantern\n\"Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern\")_ , eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-\nchief.[5] While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking [gin](/wiki/Gin \"Gin\")\nwith nine friends in his room.[13] At the time, the possession and consumption\nof alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between\n1920 and 1933. As a result of this infraction, Dean [Craven\nLaycock](/wiki/Craven_Laycock \"Craven Laycock\") insisted that Geisel resign\nfrom all extracurricular activities, including the college humor magazine.[14]\nTo continue work on the _Jack-O-Lantern_ without the administration's\nknowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the [pen name](/wiki/Pen_name\n\"Pen name\") \"Seuss\". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric\nW. Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his \"big inspiration for writing\" at\nDartmouth.[15]\n\nUpon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered [Lincoln College,\nOxford](/wiki/Lincoln_College,_Oxford \"Lincoln College, Oxford\"), intending to\nearn a PhD in English literature.[16] At Oxford, he met [Helen\nPalmer](/wiki/Helen_Palmer_\\(author\\) \"Helen Palmer \\(author\\)\"), who\nencouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing\ndrawing as a career.[16]\n\n### Early career\n\nGeisel left Oxford without earning a degree and returned to the United States\nin February 1927,[17] where he immediately began submitting writings and\ndrawings to magazines, book publishers, and advertising agencies.[18] Making\nuse of his time in Europe, he pitched a series of cartoons called _Eminent\nEuropeans_ to _[Life](/wiki/Life_\\(magazine\\) \"Life \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine,\nbut the magazine passed on it. His first nationally published cartoon appeared\nin the July 16, 1927, issue of _[The Saturday Evening\nPost](/wiki/The_Saturday_Evening_Post \"The Saturday Evening Post\")_.[19] This\nsingle $25 sale encouraged Geisel to move from Springfield to New York City.\n\nLater that year, Geisel accepted a job as writer and illustrator at the humor\nmagazine _[Judge](/wiki/Judge_\\(magazine\\) \"Judge \\(magazine\\)\")_ , and he\nfelt financially stable enough to marry Helen.[20] His first cartoon for\n_Judge_ appeared on October 22, 1927, and the Geisels were married on November\n29. Geisel's first work signed \"Dr. Seuss\" was published in _Judge_ about six\nmonths after he started working there.[21]\n\nIn early 1928, one of Geisel's cartoons for _Judge_ mentioned\n[FLIT](/wiki/FLIT \"FLIT\"), a common bug spray at the time manufactured by\n[Standard Oil of New Jersey](/wiki/Esso \"Esso\").[22] According to Geisel, the\nwife of an advertising executive in charge of advertising FLIT saw Geisel's\ncartoon at a hairdresser's and urged her husband to sign him.[23] Geisel's\nfirst Flit ad appeared on May 31, 1928, and the campaign continued\nsporadically until 1941.[24] The campaign's catchphrase \"Quick, Henry, the\nFlit!\" became a part of popular culture. It spawned a song and was used as a\npunch line for comedians such as [Fred Allen](/wiki/Fred_Allen \"Fred Allen\")\nand [Jack Benny](/wiki/Jack_Benny \"Jack Benny\"). As Geisel gained notoriety\nfor the FLIT campaign, his work was in demand and began to appear regularly in\nmagazines such as _[Life](/wiki/Life_\\(magazine\\) \"Life \\(magazine\\)\")_ ,\n_[Liberty](/wiki/Liberty_\\(general_interest_magazine\\) \"Liberty \\(general\ninterest magazine\\)\")_ , and _[Vanity Fair](/wiki/Vanity_Fair_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Vanity Fair \\(magazine\\)\")_.\n\nGeisel supported himself and his wife through the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States \"Great Depression in\nthe United States\") by drawing advertising for [General\nElectric](/wiki/General_Electric \"General Electric\"), [NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\"),\n[Standard Oil](/wiki/Standard_Oil \"Standard Oil\"), [Narragansett Brewing\nCompany](/wiki/Narragansett_Brewing_Company \"Narragansett Brewing Company\"),\nand many other companies. In 1935, he wrote and drew a short-lived comic strip\ncalled _[Hejji](/wiki/Hejji \"Hejji\")_.[25]\n\nThe increased income allowed the Geisels to move to better quarters and to\nsocialize in higher social circles.[26] They became friends with the wealthy\nfamily of banker [Frank A. Vanderlip](/wiki/Frank_A._Vanderlip \"Frank A.\nVanderlip\"). They also traveled extensively: by 1936, Geisel and his wife had\nvisited 30 countries together. They did not have children, neither kept\nregular office hours, and they had ample money.[27] Geisel also felt that the\ntraveling helped his creativity.\n\nIn 1936, the couple were returning from an ocean voyage to Europe when the\nrhythm of the ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book:\n_[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry\nStreet](/wiki/And_to_Think_That_I_Saw_It_on_Mulberry_Street \"And to Think That\nI Saw It on Mulberry Street\")_.[28] Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the\nbook was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers.[29][30] According to\nGeisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter\nwith an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by [Vanguard\nPress](/wiki/Vanguard_Press \"Vanguard Press\").[31] Geisel wrote four more\nbooks before the US entered World War II. This included _[The 500 Hats of\nBartholomew Cubbins](/wiki/The_500_Hats_of_Bartholomew_Cubbins \"The 500 Hats\nof Bartholomew Cubbins\")_ in 1938, as well as _[The King's\nStilts](/wiki/The_King%27s_Stilts \"The King's Stilts\")_ and _[The Seven Lady\nGodivas](/wiki/The_Seven_Lady_Godivas \"The Seven Lady Godivas\")_ in 1939, all\nof which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by _[Horton\nHatches the Egg](/wiki/Horton_Hatches_the_Egg \"Horton Hatches the Egg\")_ in\n1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.\n\n### Essomarine\n\nGeisel gained a significant public profile through a program for motor boat\nlubricants produced by Standard Oil under the brand name Essomarine.[32] He\nlater recounted that [Harry Bruno](/wiki/Harry_Bruno \"Harry Bruno\"), Ted Cook,\nand Verne Carrier worked with him at the National Motor Boat Show on exhibits\nreferred to as the Seuss Navy.[33]\n\nIn 1934, Geisel produced a 30-page booklet titled _Secrets of the Deep_ which\nwas available by mail after June. At the January [boat show](/wiki/Boat_show\n\"Boat show\") for 1935, visitors filled out order cards to receive _Secrets_.\nGeisel drew up a Certificate of Commission for visitors in 1936. A mock ship\ndeck called _SS Essomarine_ provided the scene where photos of \"Admirals\" were\ntaken. That summer, Geisel released a second volume of _Secrets_. For the 1937\nshow, he sculpted Marine Muggs and designed a flag for the Seuss\nNavy.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nThe following year featured \"Little Dramas of the Deep\", a six-act play with\nten characters. According to Geisel's sister, \"He plans the whole show with\nscenery and action and then, standing in a realistic\n[bridge](/wiki/Bridge_\\(nautical\\) \"Bridge \\(nautical\\)\"), reels off a speech\nwhich combines advertising with humor.\" For 1939, exhibitors made available\nthe Nuzzlepuss [ashtray](/wiki/Ashtray \"Ashtray\") and illustrated tide-table\ncalendars.\n\nA Seuss Navy Luncheon was held on January 11, 1940, at the [Waldorf-Astoria\nHotel](/wiki/Waldorf_Astoria_New_York \"Waldorf Astoria New York\"). At that\nyear's boat show, Geisel provided the Navigamarama exhibit and the _Sea\nLawyers Gazette_.\n\nThe final contribution to the Essomarine project was the\n[mermaid](/wiki/Mermaid \"Mermaid\") Essie Neptune and her pet whale in 1941.\nThe exhibit offered photos for a Happy Cruising passport.[34]\n\n### World War II-era work\n\n![File:The\nGoldbrick.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/The_Goldbrick.ogv/220px\n--The_Goldbrick.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/The_Goldbrick.ogv \"Play\nmedia\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Goldbrick.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"The Goldbrick\", Private Snafu episode written by Geisel, 1943\n\nAs World War II began, Geisel turned to political cartoons, drawing over 400\nin two years as editorial cartoonist for the left-leaning New York City daily\nnewspaper, _[PM](/wiki/PM_\\(newspaper\\) \"PM \\(newspaper\\)\")_.[35] Geisel's\npolitical cartoons, later published in _[Dr. Seuss Goes to\nWar](/wiki/Dr._Seuss_Goes_to_War \"Dr. Seuss Goes to War\")_ , denounced\n[Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler \"Adolf Hitler\") and\n[Mussolini](/wiki/Benito_Mussolini \"Benito Mussolini\") and were highly\ncritical of non-interventionists (\"isolationists\"), most notably [Charles\nLindbergh](/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh \"Charles Lindbergh\"), who opposed US entry\ninto the war.[36] One cartoon[37] depicted all [Japanese\nAmericans](/wiki/Japanese_Americans \"Japanese Americans\") as latent traitors\nor [fifth-columnists](/wiki/Fifth_column \"Fifth column\"), while other cartoons\nsimultaneously deplored the racism at home against [Jews](/wiki/Jews \"Jews\")\nand blacks that harmed the war effort.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] His\ncartoons were strongly supportive of [President\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\")'s handling of\nthe war, combining the usual exhortations to ration and contribute to the war\neffort with frequent attacks on Congress[38] (especially the [Republican\nParty](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party \\(United\nStates\\)\")),[39] parts of the press (such as the _[New York Daily\nNews](/wiki/New_York_Daily_News \"New York Daily News\")_ , _[Chicago\nTribune](/wiki/Chicago_Tribune \"Chicago Tribune\")_ , and _[Washington Times-\nHerald](/wiki/Washington_Times-Herald \"Washington Times-Herald\")_),[40] and\nothers for criticism of Roosevelt, criticism of aid to the Soviet\nUnion,[41][42] investigation of suspected Communists,[43] and other offences\nthat he depicted as leading to disunity and helping the Nazis, intentionally\nor inadvertently.\n\nIn 1942, Geisel turned his energies to direct support of the U.S. war effort.\nFirst, he worked drawing posters for the [Treasury\nDepartment](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury \"United States\nDepartment of the Treasury\") and the [War Production\nBoard](/wiki/War_Production_Board \"War Production Board\"). Then, in 1943, he\njoined the Army as a [Captain](/wiki/Captain_\\(United_States_O-3\\) \"Captain\n\\(United States O-3\\)\") and was commander of the Animation Department of the\n[First Motion Picture Unit](/wiki/First_Motion_Picture_Unit \"First Motion\nPicture Unit\") of the [United States Army Air\nForces](/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces \"United States Army Air Forces\"),\nwhere he wrote films that included _[Your Job in\nGermany](/wiki/Your_Job_in_Germany \"Your Job in Germany\")_ , a 1945 propaganda\nfilm about peace in Europe after World War II; _[Our Job in\nJapan](/wiki/Our_Job_in_Japan \"Our Job in Japan\")_ ; and the _[Private\nSnafu](/wiki/Private_Snafu \"Private Snafu\")_ series of adult army training\nfilms. While in the Army, he was awarded the [Legion of\nMerit](/wiki/Legion_of_Merit \"Legion of Merit\").[44] _Our Job in Japan_ became\nthe basis for the commercially released film _[Design for\nDeath](/wiki/Design_for_Death \"Design for Death\")_ (1947), a study of\n[Japanese culture](/wiki/Culture_of_Japan \"Culture of Japan\") that won the\n[Academy Award for Best Documentary\nFeature](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Documentary_Feature \"Academy Award for\nBest Documentary Feature\").[45] _[Gerald McBoing-Boing](/wiki/Gerald_McBoing-\nBoing \"Gerald McBoing-Boing\")_ (1950) was based on an original story by Seuss\nand won the [Academy Award for Best Animated Short\nFilm](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Animated_Short_Film#1950s \"Academy Award\nfor Best Animated Short Film\").[46]\n\n### Later years\n\nAfter the war, Geisel and his wife moved to [La Jolla,\nCalifornia](/wiki/La_Jolla,_San_Diego,_California \"La Jolla, San Diego,\nCalifornia\") where he returned to writing children's books. He wrote many,\nincluding such favorites as _[If I Ran the Zoo](/wiki/If_I_Ran_the_Zoo \"If I\nRan the Zoo\")_ (1950), _[Horton Hears a Who!](/wiki/Horton_Hears_a_Who!\n\"Horton Hears a Who!\")_ (1955), _[If I Ran the\nCircus](/wiki/If_I_Ran_the_Circus \"If I Ran the Circus\")_ (1956), _[The Cat in\nthe Hat](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Cat in the Hat\")_ (1957), _[How the\nGrinch Stole Christmas!](/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas! \"How the Grinch\nStole Christmas!\")_ (1957), and _[Green Eggs and Ham](/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham\n\"Green Eggs and Ham\")_ (1960). He received numerous awards throughout his\ncareer, but he won neither the [Caldecott Medal](/wiki/Caldecott_Medal\n\"Caldecott Medal\") nor the [Newbery Medal](/wiki/Newbery_Medal \"Newbery\nMedal\"). Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as\nCaldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): _[McElligot's\nPool](/wiki/McElligot%27s_Pool \"McElligot's Pool\")_ (1947), _Bartholomew and\nthe Oobleck_ (1949), and _If I Ran the Zoo_ (1950). Dr Seuss also wrote the\n[musical](/wiki/Musical_film \"Musical film\") and [fantasy\nfilm](/wiki/Fantasy_film \"Fantasy film\") _[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr.\nT.](/wiki/The_5,000_Fingers_of_Dr._T. \"The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.\")_ , which\nwas released in 1953. The movie was a critical and financial failure, and\nGeisel never attempted another feature film. During the 1950s, he also\npublished a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in\n_[Redbook](/wiki/Redbook \"Redbook\")_ Magazine. Some of these were later\ncollected (in volumes such as _The Sneetches and Other Stories_) or reworked\ninto independent books (_If I Ran the Zoo_). A number have never been\nreprinted since their original appearances.\n\nIn May 1954, _[Life](/wiki/Life_\\(magazine\\) \"Life \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine\npublished a report on [illiteracy](/wiki/Literacy \"Literacy\") among school\nchildren which concluded that children were not learning to read because their\nbooks were boring. William Ellsworth Spaulding was the director of the\neducation division at Houghton Mifflin (he later became its chairman), and he\ncompiled a list of 348 words that he felt were important for first-graders to\nrecognize. He asked Geisel to cut the list to 250 words and to write a book\nusing only those words.[47] Spaulding challenged Geisel to \"bring back a book\nchildren can't put down\".[48] Nine months later, Geisel completed _[The Cat in\nthe Hat](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Cat in the Hat\")_ , using 236 of the\nwords given to him. It retained the drawing style, verse rhythms, and all the\nimaginative power of Geisel's earlier works but, because of its simplified\nvocabulary, it could be read by beginning readers. _The Cat in the Hat_ and\nsubsequent books written for young children achieved significant international\nsuccess and they remain very popular today. In 2009, _Green Eggs and Ham_ sold\n540,366 copies, _The Cat in the Hat_ sold 452,258 copies, and _[One Fish, Two\nFish, Red Fish, Blue Fish](/wiki/One_Fish,_Two_Fish,_Red_Fish,_Blue_Fish \"One\nFish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish\")_ (1960) sold 409,068 copies—outselling\nthe majority of newly published children's books.[49]\n\nGeisel went on to write many other children's books, both in his new\nsimplified-vocabulary manner (sold as [Beginner Books](/wiki/Beginner_Books\n\"Beginner Books\")) and in his older, more elaborate style.\n\nIn 1956, Dartmouth awarded Geisel with an honorary doctorate, finally\njustifying the \"Dr.\" in his pen name.\n\nOn April 28, 1958, Geisel appeared on an episode of the panel game show _[To\nTell the Truth](/wiki/To_Tell_the_Truth \"To Tell the Truth\")_.[50]\n\nGeisel's wife Helen had a long struggle with illnesses, including cancer and\nemotional pain over Geisel's affair with Audrey Stone Dimond. On October 23,\n1967, Helen committed [suicide](/wiki/Suicide \"Suicide\"); Geisel married\nDimond on June 21, 1968.[51] Though he devoted most of his life to writing\nchildren's books, Geisel had no children of his own, saying of children: \"You\nhave 'em; I'll entertain 'em.\"[51] Dimond added that Geisel \"lived his whole\nlife without children and he was very happy without children.\"[51]\n\nGeisel received the [Laura Ingalls Wilder\nMedal](/wiki/Laura_Ingalls_Wilder_Medal \"Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal\") from the\n[professional children's\nlibrarians](/wiki/Association_for_Library_Service_to_Children \"Association for\nLibrary Service to Children\") in 1980, recognizing his \"substantial and\nlasting contributions to children's literature\". At the time, it was awarded\nevery five years.[52] He won a [special Pulitzer\nPrize](/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_Special_Citations_and_Awards \"Pulitzer Prize\nSpecial Citations and Awards\") in 1984 citing his \"contribution over nearly\nhalf a century to the education and enjoyment of America's children and their\nparents\".[53]\n\n## Illness, death, and posthumous honors\n\nGeisel died of [oral cancer](/wiki/Oral_cancer \"Oral cancer\") on September 24,\n1991 at his home in La Jolla at the age of 87.[54][55] He was cremated and his\nashes were scattered. On December 1, 1995, four years after his death,\n[University of California, San\nDiego](/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego \"University of California,\nSan Diego\")'s University Library Building was renamed [Geisel\nLibrary](/wiki/Geisel_Library \"Geisel Library\") in honor of Geisel and Audrey\nfor the generous contributions that they made to the library and their\ndevotion to improving literacy.[56]\n\nWhile Geisel was living in La Jolla, the [United States Postal\nService](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service \"United States Postal Service\")\nand others frequently confused him with fellow La Jolla resident [Dr. Hans\nSuess](/wiki/Hans_Suess \"Hans Suess\"). Their names have been linked together\nposthumously: the personal papers of Hans Suess are housed in the Geisel\nLibrary.[57]\n\nIn 2002, the [Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture\nGarden](/wiki/Dr._Seuss_Memorial \"Dr. Seuss Memorial\") opened in his\nbirthplace of [Springfield, Massachusetts](/wiki/Springfield,_Massachusetts\n\"Springfield, Massachusetts\"), featuring sculptures of Geisel and of many of\nhis characters. On May 28, 2008, California Governor [Arnold\nSchwarzenegger](/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\") and First\nLady [Maria Shriver](/wiki/Maria_Shriver \"Maria Shriver\") announced that\nGeisel would be inducted into the [California Hall of\nFame](/wiki/California_Hall_of_Fame \"California Hall of Fame\") located at [The\nCalifornia Museum for History, Women and the Arts](/wiki/The_California_Museum\n\"The California Museum\"). The induction ceremony took place December 15 and\nGeisel's widow Audrey accepted the honor in his place. On March 2, 2009, the\n[Web search engine](/wiki/Web_search_engine \"Web search engine\")\n[Google](/wiki/Google \"Google\") temporarily changed its\n[logo](/wiki/Google_logo \"Google logo\") to commemorate Geisel's birthday (a\npractice that it often follows for various holidays and events).[58]\n\nIn 2004, U.S. children's librarians established the annual [Theodor Seuss\nGeisel Award](/wiki/Geisel_Award \"Geisel Award\") to recognize \"the most\ndistinguished American book for beginning readers published in English in the\nUnited States during the preceding year\". It should \"demonstrate creativity\nand imagination to engage children in reading\" from [pre-\nkindergarten](/wiki/Pre-kindergarten \"Pre-kindergarten\") to [second\ngrade](/wiki/Second_grade \"Second grade\").[59]\n\nAt Geisel's alma mater of Dartmouth, more than 90 percent of incoming first-\nyear students participate in pre-registration [Dartmouth Outing\nClub](/wiki/Dartmouth_Outing_Club \"Dartmouth Outing Club\") trips into the New\nHampshire wilderness. It is traditional for students returning from the trips\nto stay overnight at Dartmouth's [Moosilauke Ravine\nLodge](/wiki/Moosilauke_Ravine_Lodge \"Moosilauke Ravine Lodge\"), where they\nare served green eggs and ham for breakfast in honor of Dr. Seuss. On April 4,\n2012, the Dartmouth Medical School was renamed the [Audrey and Theodor Geisel\nSchool of Medicine](/wiki/Geisel_School_of_Medicine \"Geisel School of\nMedicine\") in honor of their many years of generosity to the college.[60]\n\nDr. Seuss's honors include two [Academy Awards](/wiki/Academy_Awards \"Academy\nAwards\"), two [Emmy Awards](/wiki/Emmy_Award \"Emmy Award\"), a [Peabody\nAward](/wiki/Peabody_Award \"Peabody Award\"), the [Laura Ingalls Wilder\nMedal](/wiki/Laura_Ingalls_Wilder_Medal \"Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal\"), and the\n[Pulitzer Prize](/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize \"Pulitzer Prize\").\n\nDr. Seuss has a star on the [Hollywood Walk of\nFame](/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame \"Hollywood Walk of Fame\") at the 6500 block\nof [Hollywood Boulevard](/wiki/Hollywood_Boulevard \"Hollywood Boulevard\").[61]\n\n## Pen names and pronunciations\n\nGeisel's most famous pen name is regularly pronounced\n[/suːs/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\"),[1] an\n[anglicized](/wiki/Anglicisation \"Anglicisation\") pronunciation inconsistent\nwith his German surname (the standard German pronunciation is\n[[ˈzɔʏ̯s]](/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German \"Help:IPA/Standard German\")). He\nhimself noted that it rhymed with \"voice\" (his own pronunciation being\n[/sɔɪs/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\")). Alexander Laing, one of\nhis collaborators on the _[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern](/wiki/Dartmouth_Jack-O-\nLantern \"Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern\")_ ,[62] wrote of it:\n\n> You're wrong as the deuce  \n>  And you shouldn't rejoice  \n>  If you're calling him Seuss.  \n>  He pronounces it Soice[63] (or Zoice)[64]\n\nGeisel switched to the anglicized pronunciation because it \"evoked a figure\nadvantageous for an author of children's books to be associated with—[Mother\nGoose](/wiki/Mother_Goose \"Mother Goose\")\"[48] and because most people used\nthis pronunciation. He added the \"Doctor (abbreviated Dr.)\" to his pen name\nbecause his father had always wanted him to practice medicine.[65]\n\nFor books that Geisel wrote and others illustrated, he used the pen name \"Theo\nLeSieg\", starting with _[I Wish That I Had Duck\nFeet](/wiki/I_Wish_That_I_Had_Duck_Feet \"I Wish That I Had Duck Feet\")_\npublished in 1965. \"LeSieg\" is \"Geisel\" spelled backward.[66] Geisel also\npublished one book under the name Rosetta Stone, 1975's _Because a Little Bug\nWent Ka-Choo!!_ , a collaboration with [Michael K.\nFrith](/wiki/Michael_K._Frith \"Michael K. Frith\"). Frith and Geisel chose the\nname in honor of Geisel's second wife Audrey, whose maiden name was Stone.[67]\n\n## Political views\n\nMain article: [Political messages of Dr.\nSeuss](/wiki/Political_messages_of_Dr._Seuss \"Political messages of Dr.\nSeuss\")\n\nGeisel was a liberal [Democrat](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Democratic Party \\(United States\\)\") and a supporter of President [Franklin\nD. Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\") and the\n[New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\"). His early political cartoons show a\npassionate opposition to fascism, and he urged action against it both before\nand after the United States entered World War II. His cartoons portrayed the\nfear of communism as overstated, finding greater threats in the [House Un-\nAmerican Activities Committee](/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee\n\"House Un-American Activities Committee\") and those who threatened to cut the\nUnited States' \"life line\"[42] to Stalin and the USSR, whom he once depicted\nas a [porter](/wiki/Porter_\\(carrier\\) \"Porter \\(carrier\\)\") carrying \"our war\nload\".[41]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Seuss_cartoon.png/220px-\nSeuss_cartoon.png)](/wiki/File:Seuss_cartoon.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Seuss_cartoon.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nDr. Seuss 1942 cartoon with the caption 'Waiting for the Signal from Home'\n\nGeisel supported the [internment of Japanese\nAmericans](/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans \"Internment of Japanese\nAmericans\") during World War II. His treatment of the Japanese and of Japanese\nAmericans (between whom he often failed to differentiate) has struck many\nreaders as a [moral blind spot](/wiki/Moral_blindness \"Moral blindness\").[68]\nOn the issue of the Japanese, he is quoted as saying:\n\n> But right now, when the Japs are planting their hatchets in our skulls, it\n> seems like a hell of a time for us to smile and warble: \"Brothers!\" It is a\n> rather flabby battle cry. If we want to win, we've got to kill Japs, whether\n> it depresses [John Haynes Holmes](/wiki/John_Haynes_Holmes \"John Haynes\n> Holmes\") or not. We can get palsy-walsy afterward with those that are\n> left.[69]\n\nAfter the war, though, Geisel overcame his feelings of animosity, using his\nbook _[Horton Hears a Who!](/wiki/Horton_Hears_a_Who! \"Horton Hears a Who!\")_\n(1954) as an [allegory](/wiki/Allegory \"Allegory\") for the Hiroshima bombing\nand the American post-war [occupation of Japan](/wiki/Occupation_of_Japan\n\"Occupation of Japan\"), as well as dedicating the book to a Japanese\nfriend.[70]\n\nIn 1948, after living and working in Hollywood for years, Geisel moved to La\nJolla, California, a predominantly Republican town.[71]\n\nGeisel converted a copy of one of his famous children's books, _[Marvin K.\nMooney Will You Please Go Now!](/wiki/Marvin_K._Mooney_Will_You_Please_Go_Now!\n\"Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!\")_ , into a [polemic](/wiki/Polemic\n\"Polemic\") shortly before the end of the 1972–1974 [Watergate\nscandal](/wiki/Watergate_scandal \"Watergate scandal\"), in which [United States\npresident](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\") [Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\") resigned, by\nreplacing the name of the main character everywhere that it occurred.[72]\n\"Richard M. Nixon, Will You Please Go Now!\" was published in major newspapers\nthrough the [column](/wiki/Column_\\(periodical\\) \"Column \\(periodical\\)\") of\nhis friend [Art Buchwald](/wiki/Art_Buchwald \"Art Buchwald\").[72]\n\nThe line \"a person's a person, no matter _how_ small!!\" from _Horton Hears a\nWho!_ has been used widely as a slogan by the [pro-life](/wiki/Anti-\nabortion_movements \"Anti-abortion movements\") movement in the U.S., despite\nthe objections of Geisel's widow. The line was first used in such a way in\n1986; he demanded a retraction and received one.[73]\n\n### In his books\n\nGeisel made a point of not beginning to write his stories with a moral in\nmind, stating that \"kids can see a moral coming a mile off.\" He was not\nagainst writing about issues, however; he said that \"there's an inherent moral\nin any story\",[74] and he remarked that he was \"subversive as hell.\"[75]\n\nMany of Geisel's books express his views on a remarkable variety of social and\npolitical issues: _[The Lorax](/wiki/The_Lorax \"The Lorax\")_ (1971), about\nenvironmentalism and [anti-consumerism](/wiki/Anti-consumerism \"Anti-\nconsumerism\"); \"[The Sneetches](/wiki/The_Sneetches_and_Other_Stories \"The\nSneetches and Other Stories\")\" (1961), about [racial\nequality](/wiki/Racial_equality \"Racial equality\"); _[The Butter Battle\nBook](/wiki/The_Butter_Battle_Book \"The Butter Battle Book\")_ (1984), about\nthe [arms race](/wiki/Arms_race \"Arms race\"); _[Yertle the\nTurtle](/wiki/Yertle_the_Turtle_and_Other_Stories \"Yertle the Turtle and Other\nStories\")_ (1958), about [Adolf Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler \"Adolf Hitler\") and\n[anti-authoritarianism](/wiki/Anti-authoritarianism \"Anti-authoritarianism\");\n_[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!](/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas! \"How\nthe Grinch Stole Christmas!\")_ (1957), criticizing the\n[materialism](/wiki/Materialism \"Materialism\") and\n[consumerism](/wiki/Consumerism \"Consumerism\") of the Christmas season; and\n_[Horton Hears a Who!](/wiki/Horton_Hears_a_Who! \"Horton Hears a Who!\")_\n(1954), about anti-[isolationism](/wiki/Isolationism \"Isolationism\") and\n[internationalism](/wiki/Internationalism_\\(politics\\) \"Internationalism\n\\(politics\\)\").[48][70]\n\n## Poetic meters\n\nGeisel wrote most of his books in [anapestic\ntetrameter](/wiki/Anapestic_tetrameter \"Anapestic tetrameter\"), a [poetic\nmeter](/wiki/Meter_\\(poetry\\) \"Meter \\(poetry\\)\") employed by many poets of\nthe English literary canon. This is often suggested as one of the reasons that\nGeisel's writing was so well received.[76][77]\n\nAnapestic tetrameter consists of four rhythmic units called\n[anapests](/wiki/Anapaest \"Anapaest\"), each composed of two weak syllables\nfollowed by one strong syllable (the beat); often, the first weak syllable is\nomitted, or an additional weak syllable is added at the end. An example of\nthis meter can be found in Geisel's \"Yertle the Turtle\", from _[Yertle the\nTurtle and Other Stories](/wiki/Yertle_the_Turtle_and_Other_Stories \"Yertle\nthe Turtle and Other Stories\")_ :\n\n> And to**day** the Great **Yer** tle, that **Mar** velous **he**  \n>  Is **King** of the **Mud**. That is **all** he can **see**.[78]\n\nSome books by Geisel that are written mainly in anapestic tetrameter also\ncontain many lines written in [amphibrachic tetrameter](/wiki/Amphibrach\n\"Amphibrach\"), such as these from _If I Ran the Circus_ :\n\n> All **rea** dy to **put** up the **tents** for my **cir** cus.  \n>  I **think** I will **call** it the **Cir** cus Mc**Gur** kus.\n\n> And **NOW** comes an **act** of E**nor** mous E**nor** mance!  \n>  No **for** mer per**for** mer's per**formed** this per**for** mance!\n\nGeisel also wrote verse in [trochaic tetrameter](/wiki/Trochaic_tetrameter\n\"Trochaic tetrameter\"), an arrangement of a strong syllable followed by a weak\nsyllable, with four units per line (for example, the title of _[**One** Fish\n**Two** Fish **Red** Fish **Blue**\nFish](/wiki/One_Fish,_Two_Fish,_Red_Fish,_Blue_Fish \"One Fish, Two Fish, Red\nFish, Blue Fish\")_). Traditionally, English trochaic meter permits the final\nweak position in the line to be omitted, which allows both masculine and\nfeminine rhymes.\n\nGeisel generally maintained trochaic meter for only brief passages, and for\nlonger stretches typically mixed it with [iambic\ntetrameter](/wiki/Iambic_tetrameter \"Iambic tetrameter\"), which consists of a\nweak syllable followed by a strong, and is generally considered easier to\nwrite. Thus, for example, the magicians in _[Bartholomew and the\nOobleck](/wiki/Bartholomew_and_the_Oobleck \"Bartholomew and the Oobleck\")_\nmake their first appearance chanting in [trochees](/wiki/Trochee \"Trochee\")\n(thus resembling the witches of [Shakespeare's](/wiki/William_Shakespeare\n\"William Shakespeare\") _[Macbeth](/wiki/Macbeth \"Macbeth\")_):\n\n> **Shuff** le, **duff** le, **muzz** le, **muff**\n\nThey then switch to [iambs](/wiki/Iamb_\\(poetry\\) \"Iamb \\(poetry\\)\") for the\noobleck spell:\n\n> Go **make** the **Oob** leck **tum** ble **down**  \n>  On **ev** ery **street** , in **ev** ery **town**![79]\n\n## Artwork\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

His later books,\nsuch as _[The Lorax](/wiki/The_Lorax \"The Lorax\"),_ used more colors.\n\nGeisel's style was unique – his figures are often \"rounded\" and somewhat\ndroopy. This is true, for instance, of the faces of [the\nGrinch](/wiki/The_grinch \"The grinch\") and [the Cat in the\nHat](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Cat in the Hat\"). Almost all his buildings\nand machinery were devoid of straight lines when they were drawn, even when he\nwas representing real objects. For example, _[If I Ran the\nCircus](/wiki/If_I_Ran_the_Circus \"If I Ran the Circus\")_ shows a droopy\nhoisting crane and a droopy [steam calliope](/wiki/Steam_calliope \"Steam\ncalliope\").\n\nGeisel evidently enjoyed drawing architecturally elaborate objects. His\nendlessly varied but never rectilinear palaces, ramps, platforms, and free-\nstanding stairways are among his most evocative creations. Geisel also drew\ncomplex imaginary machines, such as the _Audio-Telly-O-Tally-O-Count_ , from\n_[Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book](/wiki/Dr._Seuss%27s_Sleep_Book \"Dr. Seuss's Sleep\nBook\")_, or the \"most peculiar machine\" of Sylvester McMonkey McBean in _[The\nSneetches](/wiki/The_Sneetches \"The Sneetches\")_. Geisel also liked drawing\noutlandish arrangements of feathers or fur: for example, the 500th hat of\n_[Bartholomew Cubbins](/wiki/Bartholomew_Cubbins \"Bartholomew Cubbins\")_ , the\ntail of _[Gertrude McFuzz](/wiki/Gertrude_McFuzz \"Gertrude McFuzz\")_ , and the\npet for girls who like to brush and comb, in _One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish,\nBlue Fish_.\n\nGeisel's illustrations often convey motion vividly. He was fond of a sort of\n\"voilà\" gesture in which the hand flips outward and the fingers spread\nslightly backward with the thumb up. This motion is done by Ish in _One Fish,\nTwo Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish_ when he creates fish (who perform the gesture\nwith their fins), in the introduction of the various acts of _If I Ran the\nCircus_ , and in the introduction of the \"Little Cats\" in _[The Cat in the Hat\nComes Back](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Cat in the Hat\")_. He was also fond\nof drawing hands with interlocked fingers, making it look as though his\ncharacters were twiddling their thumbs.\n\nGeisel also follows the [cartoon](/wiki/Cartoon \"Cartoon\") tradition of\nshowing [motion with lines](/wiki/Motion_lines \"Motion lines\"), like in the\nsweeping lines that accompany Sneelock's final dive in _If I Ran the Circus_.\nCartoon lines are also used to illustrate the action of the senses—sight,\nsmell, and hearing—in _The Big Brag,_ and lines even illustrate \"thought\", as\nin the moment when the Grinch conceives his awful plan to ruin Christmas.\n\n### Recurring images\n\nGeisel's early work in advertising and [editorial\ncartooning](/wiki/Editorial_cartoonist \"Editorial cartoonist\") helped him to\nproduce \"sketches\" of things that received more perfect realization later in\nhis children's books. Often, the expressive use to which Geisel put an image\nlater on was quite different from the original.[80] Here are some examples:\n\n  * An editorial cartoon from July 16, 1941[81] depicts a whale resting on the top of a mountain as a [parody](/wiki/Parody \"Parody\") of American [isolationists](/wiki/Isolationism \"Isolationism\"), especially [Charles Lindbergh](/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh \"Charles Lindbergh\"). This was later rendered (with no apparent political content) as the Wumbus of _On Beyond Zebra_ (1955). Seussian whales (cheerful and balloon-shaped, with long eyelashes) also occur in _McElligot 's Pool_, _If I Ran the Circus_ , and other books.\n  * Another editorial cartoon from 1941[82] shows a long cow with many legs and udders representing the conquered nations of Europe being milked by [Adolf Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler \"Adolf Hitler\"). This later became the Umbus of _On Beyond Zebra_.\n  * The tower of turtles in a 1942 editorial cartoon[83] prefigures a similar tower in _[Yertle the Turtle](/wiki/Yertle_the_Turtle_and_Other_Stories \"Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories\")_. This theme also appeared in a _Judge_ cartoon as one letter of a hieroglyphic message, and in Geisel's short-lived comic strip _[Hejji](/wiki/Hejji \"Hejji\")_. Geisel once stated that Yertle the Turtle was Adolf Hitler.[84]\n  * Little cats A, B, and C (as well as the rest of the alphabet) who spring from each other's hats appeared in a [Ford Motor Company ⋅](/w/index.php?title=Ford_Motor_Company_%E2%8B%85&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Ford Motor Company ⋅ \\(page does not exist\\)\") ad.\n  * The connected beards in _Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?_ appear frequently in Geisel's work, most notably in _Hejji_ , which featured two goats joined at the beard, _The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T._ , which featured two roller-skating guards joined at the beard, and a political cartoon in which [Nazism](/wiki/Nazism \"Nazism\") and the [America First movement](/wiki/America_First_Committee \"America First Committee\") are portrayed as \"the men with the Siamese Beard\".\n  * Geisel's earliest elephants were for advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do.[85] With _[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street](/wiki/And_to_Think_That_I_Saw_It_on_Mulberry_Street \"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street\")!_ (1937) and _[Horton Hatches the Egg](/wiki/Horton_Hatches_the_Egg \"Horton Hatches the Egg\")_ (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like [angel](/wiki/Angel \"Angel\") wings and thus appropriate to the saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons.[86] Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.\n  * While drawing advertisements for [Flit](/wiki/FLIT \"FLIT\"), Geisel became adept at drawing insects with huge stingers,[87] shaped like a gentle S-curve and with a sharp end that included a rearward-pointing barb on its lower side. Their facial expressions depict gleeful malevolence. These insects were later rendered in an editorial cartoon as a swarm of Allied aircraft[88] (1942), and again as the Sneedle of _On Beyond Zebra_ , and yet again as the Skritz in _[I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew](/wiki/I_Had_Trouble_in_Getting_to_Solla_Sollew \"I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew\")_.\n  * There are many examples of creatures who arrange themselves in repeating patterns, such as the \"Two and fro walkers, who march in five layers\", and the Through-Horns Jumping Deer in _[If I Ran the Circus](/wiki/If_I_Ran_the_Circus \"If I Ran the Circus\")_ , and the arrangement of birds which the protagonist of _[Oh, the Places You'll Go!](/wiki/Oh,_the_Places_You%27ll_Go! \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\")_ walks through, as the narrator admonishes him to \"... always be dexterous and deft, and never mix up your right foot with your left.\"\n\n## Publications\n\nFurther information: [Dr. Seuss bibliography](/wiki/Dr._Seuss_bibliography\n\"Dr. Seuss bibliography\")\n\nGeisel wrote more than 60 books over the course of his long career. Most were\npublished under his well-known pseudonym Dr. Seuss, though he also authored\nmore than a dozen books as Theo LeSieg and one as Rosetta Stone. His books\nhave topped many bestseller lists, sold over 600 million copies, and been\ntranslated into more than 20 languages.[3] In 2000, _Publishers Weekly_\ncompiled a list of the [best-selling children's\nbooks](/wiki/Best_selling_books \"Best selling books\") of all time; of the top\n100 hardcover books, 16 were written by Geisel, including _[Green Eggs and\nHam](/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham \"Green Eggs and Ham\")_ , at number 4, _[The Cat\nin the Hat](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Cat in the Hat\")_ , at number 9, and\n_One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish_ , at number 13.[89] In the years\nafter his death in 1991, two additional books were published based on his\nsketches and notes: _[Hooray for Diffendoofer\nDay!](/wiki/Hooray_for_Diffendoofer_Day! \"Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!\")_ and\n_[Daisy-Head Mayzie](/wiki/Daisy-Head_Mayzie \"Daisy-Head Mayzie\")_. _[My Many\nColored Days](/wiki/My_Many_Colored_Days \"My Many Colored Days\")_ was\noriginally written in 1973 but was posthumously published in 1996. In\nSeptember 2011, seven stories originally published in magazines during the\n1950s were released in a collection titled _[The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost\nStories](/wiki/The_Bippolo_Seed_and_Other_Lost_Stories \"The Bippolo Seed and\nOther Lost Stories\")_.[90]\n\nGeisel also wrote a pair of books for adults: _[The Seven Lady\nGodivas](/wiki/The_Seven_Lady_Godivas \"The Seven Lady Godivas\")_ (1939;\nreprinted 1987), a retelling of the [Lady Godiva](/wiki/Lady_Godiva \"Lady\nGodiva\") legend that included nude depictions; and _[You're Only Old\nOnce!](/wiki/You%27re_Only_Old_Once! \"You're Only Old Once!\")_ (written in\n1986 when Geisel was 82), which chronicles an [old man](/wiki/Old_age \"Old\nage\")'s journey through a clinic.

However, he did permit the creation of\nseveral animated cartoons, an art form in which he had gained experience\nduring World War II, and he gradually relaxed his policy as he aged.\n\nThe first adaptation of one of Geisel's works was a cartoon version of\n_[Horton Hatches the Egg](/wiki/Horton_Hatches_the_Egg \"Horton Hatches the\nEgg\")_ , animated at [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") in 1942\nand directed by [Bob Clampett](/wiki/Bob_Clampett \"Bob Clampett\"). It was\npresented as part of the [Merrie Melodies](/wiki/Merrie_Melodies \"Merrie\nMelodies\") series and included a number of gags not present in the original\nnarrative, including a fish committing suicide and a [Katharine\nHepburn](/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn \"Katharine Hepburn\") imitation by Mayzie.\n\nAs part of the Puppetoon theatrical cartoon series for [Paramount\nPictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\"), two of Geisel's\nworks were adapted into stop-motion films by George Pal. The first, \"[The 500\nHats of Bartholomew Cubbins](/wiki/The_500_Hats_of_Bartholomew_Cubbins \"The\n500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins\")\", was released in 1943[92] and nominated for\nan Academy Award for \"Short Subject (Cartoon)\" the following year.[93] The\nsecond, \"[And to Think I Saw It On Mulberry\nStreet](/wiki/And_to_Think_That_I_Saw_It_on_Mulberry_Street#film \"And to Think\nThat I Saw It on Mulberry Street\")\", with a title slightly altered from [the\nbook's](/wiki/And_to_Think_That_I_Saw_It_on_Mulberry_Street \"And to Think That\nI Saw It on Mulberry Street\"), was released in 1944.[94]\n\nIn 1959, Geisel authorized [Revell](/wiki/Revell \"Revell\"), the well-known\nplastic model-making company, to make a series of \"animals\" that snapped\ntogether rather than being glued together, and could be assembled,\ndisassembled, and re-assembled \"in thousands\" of ways. The series was called\nthe \"Dr. Seuss Zoo\" and included Gowdy the Dowdy Grackle, Norval the Bashful\nBlinket, Tingo the Noodle Topped Stroodle, and Roscoe the Many Footed Lion.\nThe basic body parts were the same and all were interchangeable, and so it was\npossible for children to combine parts from various characters in essentially\nunlimited ways in creating their own animal characters (Revell encouraged this\nby selling Gowdy, Norval, and Tingo together in a \"Gift Set\" as well as\nindividually). Revell also made a conventional glue-together \"beginner's kit\"\nof The Cat in the Hat.\n\nIn 1966, Geisel authorized eminent cartoon artist [Chuck\nJones](/wiki/Chuck_Jones \"Chuck Jones\") — his friend and former colleague from\nthe war — to make a cartoon version of _[How the Grinch Stole\nChristmas!](/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas!_\\(TV_special\\) \"How the\nGrinch Stole Christmas! \\(TV special\\)\")_ Geisel was credited as a co-producer\nunder his real name Ted Geisel, along with Jones. The cartoon was narrated by\n[Boris Karloff](/wiki/Boris_Karloff \"Boris Karloff\"), who also provided the\nvoice of the Grinch. It was very faithful to the original book, and is\nconsidered a classic to this day by many. It is often broadcast as an annual\n[Christmas television special](/wiki/Christmas_television_special \"Christmas\ntelevision special\"). Jones directed an adaptation of _[Horton Hears a\nWho!](/wiki/Horton_Hears_a_Who!_\\(TV_special\\) \"Horton Hears a Who! \\(TV\nspecial\\)\")_ in 1970 and produced an adaptation of _[The Cat in the\nHat](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat_\\(TV_special\\) \"The Cat in the Hat \\(TV\nspecial\\)\")_ in 1971.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1983, Geisel wrote six animated specials that were produced by\n[DePatie-Freleng](/wiki/DePatie-Freleng \"DePatie-Freleng\"): _[The\nLorax](/wiki/The_Lorax_\\(TV_special\\) \"The Lorax \\(TV special\\)\")_ (1972);\n_[Dr. Seuss on the Loose](/wiki/Dr._Seuss_on_the_Loose \"Dr. Seuss on the\nLoose\")_ (1973); _[The Hoober-Bloob Highway](/wiki/The_Hoober-Bloob_Highway\n\"The Hoober-Bloob Highway\")_ (1975); _[Halloween Is Grinch\nNight](/wiki/Halloween_Is_Grinch_Night \"Halloween Is Grinch Night\")_ (1977);\n_[Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You?](/wiki/Pontoffel_Pock,_Where_Are_You%3F\n\"Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You?\")_ (1980); and _[The Grinch Grinches the Cat\nin the Hat](/wiki/The_Grinch_Grinches_the_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Grinch Grinches\nthe Cat in the Hat\")_ (1982). Several of the specials won multiple\n[Emmy](/wiki/Emmy_Award \"Emmy Award\") Awards.\n\nA [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") [paint-on-glass-\nanimated](/wiki/Paint-on-glass_animation \"Paint-on-glass animation\") short\nfilm was made in 1986 called _[Welcome](/wiki/Welcome_\\(1986_film\\) \"Welcome\n\\(1986 film\\)\")_ , an adaptation of _Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose_. The last\nadaptation of Geisel's work before he died was _[The Butter Battle\nBook](/wiki/The_Butter_Battle_Book \"The Butter Battle Book\")_ , a television\nspecial based on the book of the same name, directed by adult animation legend\n[Ralph Bakshi](/wiki/Ralph_Bakshi \"Ralph Bakshi\").\n\nA television film titled _[In Search of Dr.\nSeuss](/wiki/In_Search_of_Dr._Seuss \"In Search of Dr. Seuss\")_ was released in\n1994, which adapted many of Seuss's stories. It uses both live-action versions\nand animated versions of the characters and stories featured; however, the\nanimated portions were merely edited versions of previous animated television\nspecials and, in some cases, re-dubbed as well.\n\nAfter Geisel died of cancer at the age of 87 in 1991, his widow Audrey Geisel\nwas placed in charge of all licensing matters. She approved a live-action\nfeature-film version of _[How the Grinch Stole\nChristmas](/wiki/Dr._Seuss%27_How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_\\(2000_film\\)\n\"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas \\(2000 film\\)\")_ starring [Jim\nCarrey](/wiki/Jim_Carrey \"Jim Carrey\"), as well as a Seuss-themed [Broadway\nmusical](/wiki/Broadway_theater \"Broadway theater\") called\n_[Seussical](/wiki/Seussical \"Seussical\")_ , and both premiered in 2000. _The\nGrinch_ has had limited engagement runs on Broadway during the Christmas\nseason, after premiering in 1998 (under the title _How the Grinch Stole\nChristmas_) at the [Old Globe Theatre](/wiki/Old_Globe_Theatre \"Old Globe\nTheatre\") in San Diego, where it has become a Christmas tradition. In 2003,\nanother live-action film was released, this time an adaptation of _[The Cat in\nthe Hat](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat_\\(film\\) \"The Cat in the Hat \\(film\\)\")_\nthat featured [Mike Myers](/wiki/Mike_Myers_\\(actor\\) \"Mike Myers \\(actor\\)\")\nas the title character. Audrey Geisel has spoken critically of the film,\nespecially the casting of Myers as the Cat in the Hat, and stated that she\nwould not allow any further live-action adaptations of Geisel's books.[95]\nHowever, a first animated [CGI](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-\ngenerated imagery\") feature film adaptation of _[Horton Hears a\nWho!](/wiki/Horton_Hears_a_Who!_\\(film\\) \"Horton Hears a Who! \\(film\\)\")_ was\napproved, and was eventually released on March 14, 2008, to critical acclaim.\nA second CGI-animated feature film adaptation of _[The\nLorax](/wiki/The_Lorax_\\(film\\) \"The Lorax \\(film\\)\")_ was released by\n[Universal](/wiki/Universal_Studios \"Universal Studios\") on March 2, 2012 (on\nwhat would have been Seuss's 108th birthday), and third CGI-animated feature\nfilm adaptation of _[The Grinch](/wiki/The_Grinch_\\(film\\) \"The Grinch\n\\(film\\)\")_ was released by [Universal](/wiki/Universal_Studios \"Universal\nStudios\") on November 9, 2018.\n\nFour television series have been adapted from Geisel's work. The first,\n_Gerald McBoing-Boing_ , was an animated television adaptation of Geisel's\n1951 cartoon [of the same name](/wiki/Gerald_McBoing-Boing \"Gerald McBoing-\nBoing\") and lasted three months between 1956 and 1957. The second, _[The\nWubbulous World of Dr. Seuss](/wiki/The_Wubbulous_World_of_Dr._Seuss \"The\nWubbulous World of Dr. Seuss\")_ , was a mix of live-action and puppetry by\n[Jim Henson Television](/wiki/Jim_Henson_Television \"Jim Henson Television\"),\nthe producers of [The Muppets](/wiki/The_Muppets \"The Muppets\"). It aired for\none season on [Nickelodeon](/wiki/Nickelodeon \"Nickelodeon\") in the United\nStates, from 1996 to 1997. The third, _[Gerald McBoing-\nBoing](/wiki/Gerald_McBoing-Boing_\\(TV_series\\) \"Gerald McBoing-Boing \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ , is a remake of the 1956 series.[96] Produced in Canada by\n[Cookie Jar Entertainment](/wiki/Cookie_Jar_Entertainment \"Cookie Jar\nEntertainment\") (now [DHX Media](/wiki/DHX_Media \"DHX Media\")) and North\nAmerica by [Classic Media](/wiki/Classic_Media \"Classic Media\") (now\n[DreamWorks Classics](/wiki/DreamWorks_Classics \"DreamWorks Classics\")), it\nran from 2005 to 2007. The fourth, _[The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About\nThat!](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat_Knows_a_Lot_About_That! \"The Cat in the Hat\nKnows a Lot About That!\")_ , produced by Portfolio Entertainment Inc., began\non August 7, 2010, in Canada and September 6, 2010, in the United States and\nis currently still\nshowing.[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_]\n\nGeisel's books and characters are also featured in [Seuss\nLanding](/wiki/Seuss_Landing \"Seuss Landing\"), one of many islands at the\n[Islands of Adventure](/wiki/Islands_of_Adventure \"Islands of Adventure\")\n[theme park](/wiki/Theme_park \"Theme park\") in [Orlando,\nFlorida](/wiki/Orlando,_Florida \"Orlando, Florida\"). In an attempt to match\nGeisel's visual style, there are reportedly \"no straight lines\" in Seuss\nLanding.[97]\n\n_[The Hollywood Reporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood\nReporter\")_ has reported that [Warner Animation\nGroup](/wiki/Warner_Animation_Group \"Warner Animation Group\") and Dr. Seuss\nEnterprises have struck a deal to make new animated movies based on the\nstories of Dr. Seuss. Their first project will be a fully animated version of\n[The Cat in the Hat](/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat \"The Cat in the Hat\").[98]\n\n## See also\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png)[Biography portal](/wiki/Portal:Biography \"Portal:Biography\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Tom_Sawyer_1876_frontispiece.jpg/20px-Tom_Sawyer_1876_frontispiece.jpg)[Children's literature portal](/wiki/Portal:Children%27s_literature \"Portal:Children's literature\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/WPVA-khamsa.svg/22px-WPVA-khamsa.svg.png)](/wiki/File:WPVA-khamsa.svg)[Visual arts portal](/wiki/Portal:Visual_arts \"Portal:Visual arts\")\n\n  * \"[The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite](/wiki/The_Sidewinder_Sleeps_Tonite \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\")\" – a 1992 [R.E.M.](/wiki/R.E.M. \"R.E.M.\") song referencing a reading from Seuss.\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ [\"Seuss\"](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/seuss). _[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary](/wiki/Random_House_Webster%27s_Unabridged_Dictionary \"Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary\")_.\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"About the Author, Dr. Seuss, Seussville\"](http://www.seussville.com/?home#/author).
