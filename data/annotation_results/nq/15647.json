His father, John Baptista\nhailed from [Uttan](/wiki/Uttan \"Uttan\"), near [Bassein](/wiki/Vasai \"Vasai\")\n(now Vasai). The Baptistas belonged to the [East Indian](/wiki/East_Indians\n\"East Indians\") ethnic community, who were converted to [Roman\nCatholicism](/wiki/Roman_Catholic \"Roman Catholic\") during Portuguese rule\nbetween the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nHe completed his early education from [St. Mary's School,\nMumbai](/wiki/St._Mary%27s_School,_Mumbai \"St. Mary's School, Mumbai\"). He\nthen joined the [College of Engineering](/wiki/College_of_Engineering,_Pune\n\"College of Engineering, Pune\") in [Pune](/wiki/Pune \"Pune\") and later pursued\na BA degree in [Political Science](/wiki/Political_Science \"Political\nScience\") from the [Fitzwilliam College,\nCambridge](/wiki/Fitzwilliam_College,_Cambridge \"Fitzwilliam College,\nCambridge\").[2] During this period, he first met [Bal Gangadhar\nTilak](/wiki/Bal_Gangadhar_Tilak \"Bal Gangadhar Tilak\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Political\nactivism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Baptista&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Political activism\")]\n\nIn 1901, Baptista joined the [Bombay Municipal\nCorporation](/wiki/Bombay_Municipal_Corporation \"Bombay Municipal\nCorporation\"), and would be a part of the BMC for the next 17 years.\nInfluenced by the [Irish Home Rule](/wiki/Irish_Home_Rule \"Irish Home Rule\")\nmovement, Baptista's ideas on an Indian version took root. His ideas deeply\ninfluenced Tilak and the two became close associates. He assisted Tilak by\nlaunching the _Sarvajanik Ganpati_ (public Ganpati celebrations) to raise\nnationalistic feelings.[1] In addition, Baptista coined the phrase \"Swaraj is\nmy Birthright\", that was later made popular by Tilak.[1] In 1916, along with\nTilak, [Annie Besant](/wiki/Annie_Besant \"Annie Besant\") founded the Home Rule\nMovement, with Baptista opening the [Belgaum](/wiki/Belgaum \"Belgaum\")\nunit.[1] He was also the legal advisor to Lokmanya Tilak.[3] Later he\ninterviewed British Prime Minister [David Lloyd\nGeorge](/wiki/David_Lloyd_George \"David Lloyd George\") for the British\ngovernment's views on the Home Rule. In the interview, Baptista gained the\nimpression \"that the Cabinet had decided to give India the fullest possible\nmeasure of Home Rule without delay.\"[4]\n\nBaptista was also a practising barrister at the [Bombay High\nCourt](/wiki/Bombay_High_Court \"Bombay High Court\"). One of his most high-\nprofile clients was [Vinayak Damodar Savarkar](/wiki/Vinayak_Damodar_Savarkar\n\"Vinayak Damodar Savarkar\"), where he demanded an open trial to assure the\ndignity of fundamental rights.[1] In 1920, founded the [All India Trade Union\nCongress](/wiki/All_India_Trade_Union_Congress \"All India Trade Union\nCongress\") (AITUC). As a labour leader he took up the cause of mill workers\nand postmen and other blue collar workers. Although religious, he refused to\nmix politics and religion refusing to have separate religion-based\nelectorates.[1]\n\n> I thoroughly disapprove of separate electorate for Indian Christians in\n> water-tight compartments\n\nIn 1925, Baptista was elected as the [Mayor](/wiki/Mayor_of_Mumbai \"Mayor of\nMumbai\") of the [Bombay Municipal\nCorporation](/wiki/Bombay_Municipal_Corporation \"Bombay Municipal\nCorporation\"), a post that he occupied for a year.[1]\n\n## Death[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Baptista&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Death\")]\n\nBaptista died in 1930 and is buried in the [Sewri\ncemetery](/wiki/Sewri_cemetery \"Sewri cemetery\"). The [Mazagon\nGardens](/wiki/Mazagon_Gardens \"Mazagon Gardens\"), site of the demolished\n[Mazagaon Fort](/wiki/Mazagaon_Fort \"Mazagaon Fort\"), near [Dockyard\nRoad](/wiki/Dockyard_Road \"Dockyard Road\") station is named after him. On 12\nOctober 2008, his tomb at [Sewri cemetery](/wiki/Sewri_cemetery \"Sewri\ncemetery\") was restored with the funds of local\n[MLC](/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Council_\\(India\\) \"Member of the\nLegislative Council \\(India\\)\") Kapil Patil. The ceremony was attended by\nmembers of the [Bombay Catholic Sabha](/wiki/Bombay_Catholic_Sabha \"Bombay\nCatholic Sabha\") and Shikshak Bharati, a teacher's organisation.[5]\n\nIn 1999, a book on Baptista titled _Joseph Baptista: The father of Home Rule\nin India_ was released by K R Shirsat at [Lalbaug](/wiki/Lalbaug \"Lalbaug\") in\nMumbai. Through the book, the author hoped that Baptista would be a role model\nfor modern-day youths.[6]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Baptista&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Home Rule Movement](/wiki/Home_Rule_Movement \"Home Rule Movement\")\n  * [Joseph Baptista Gardens](/wiki/Joseph_Baptista_Gardens \"Joseph Baptista Gardens\")\n\n## Further\nreading[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Baptista&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Further reading\")]\n\nShirsat, Shirsat (1974).
