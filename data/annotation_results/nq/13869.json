All successive American reprints and adaptations use that title,\nwhich is taken from the last five words of the song.[6]\n\nIt is Christie's best-selling novel, with more than 100 million copies sold;\nit is also the world's best-selling mystery and one of the [best-selling\nbooks](/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books \"List of best-selling books\") of all\ntime.

Each has an invitation tailored to his or\nher personal circumstances, such as an offer of employment or an unexpected\nlate summer holiday. They are met by Thomas and Ethel Rogers, the butler and\ncook-housekeeper, who state that their hosts, Mr Ulick Norman Owen and his\nwife Mrs Una Nancy Owen, whom they have not yet met in person, have not\narrived, but left instructions, which strikes all the guests as odd.\n\nA framed copy of a nursery rhyme, \"[Ten Little\nNiggers](/wiki/Ten_Little_Indians#Derivative_songs \"Ten Little Indians\")\"[8]\n(called \"Ten Little Indians\" or \"Ten Little Soldiers\" in later editions),\nhangs in every guest's room, and ten figurines sit on the dining room table.\nAfter supper, a [gramophone (or \"phonograph\") record](/wiki/Gramophone_record\n\"Gramophone record\") is played; the recording describes each visitor in turn,\naccuses each of having committed [murder](/wiki/Murder \"Murder\") but escaping\njustice, and then asks if any of \"the accused\" wishes to offer a defence. All\nbut Anthony Marston and Philip Lombard deny the charges, and Miss Brent\nrefuses to discuss the matter.\n\nThey discover that none of them actually knows the Owens, and Justice Wargrave\nconcludes that the name \"U.N. Owen\" is shorthand for \"Unknown\". After the\nrecording, Marston finishes his drink and immediately dies from [cyanide\npoisoning](/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning \"Cyanide poisoning\"). The remaining guests\nnotice that one of the ten figurines is now broken, and the nursery rhyme\nappears to reflect the manner of death (\"One choked his little self and then\nthere were nine\").\n\nThe next morning, Mrs Rogers' corpse is found in her bed; she had died in her\nsleep from an overdose of [chloral hydrate](/wiki/Chloral_hydrate \"Chloral\nhydrate\"). By lunchtime, General MacArthur is found dead, from a heavy blow to\nhis head. Two more figurines are found to be broken, and again the deaths\nparallel the rhyme. Miss Brent relates the account of the gramophone charge\nagainst her to Vera Claythorne, who later tells the others.\n\nA search for Mr Owen shows that nobody else is on the island except the\nremaining seven. The island is a \"bare rock\" with no hiding places, and no one\ncould have arrived or left; thus, they conclude that any one of the seven\nremaining persons is the killer. Wargrave leads the group in determining that\nso far, none of them can definitively be ruled out as the murderer. The next\nmorning, Rogers is found dead while chopping wood, and after breakfast, Miss\nBrent is found dead in the kitchen, where she had been left alone after\ncomplaining of feeling unwell; she had been injected with [potassium\ncyanide](/wiki/Potassium_cyanide \"Potassium cyanide\") via a hypodermic needle.\n\nWargrave then suggests searching all the rooms, and any potentially dangerous\nitems they can think of are locked up. Lombard's gun is missing from his room.\nWhen Vera goes upstairs to take a bath, she is shocked by the touch and smell\nof seaweed left hanging from the ceiling of her room and screams; the\nremaining guests rush upstairs to her room. Wargrave, however, is still\ndownstairs. The others find him seated, immobile and crudely dressed up in the\nattire of a judge. Wargrave is examined briefly by Dr Armstrong and pronounced\ndead from a gunshot to the forehead.\n\nThat night, Lombard appears surprised when he finds his gun returned to his\nroom. Blore catches a glimpse of someone leaving the house but loses the\ntrail. He then discovers Armstrong is absent from his room, and the remaining\nthree guests conclude that Armstrong must be the killer. Vera, Blore, and\nLombard decide to stay together at all times. In the morning, they signal SOS\nto the mainland from outside by using a mirror and sunlight, but receive no\nreply. Blore then returns to the house for food by himself and is killed by a\nheavy bear-shaped clock statue that is pushed from Vera's window sill,\ncrushing his skull.\n\nVera and Lombard are now confident that Armstrong is the killer. However,\nshortly afterwards, the duo come upon Armstrong's body washed up on the beach.\nThey realize that Armstrong could not have killed Blore. Panicked, each\nconcludes the other must be the killer. Quickly regaining her composure, Vera\nsuggests moving the doctor's body past the shore, but this is a pretext. She\nlifts Lombard's gun. When Lombard lunges at her to get it back, she shoots him\ndead.\n\nShe returns to the house in a shaken dreamlike state, relieved to be alive.\nShe finds a noose and chair arranged in her room, and a strong smell of the\nsea. With visions of her former lover Hugo urging her on, she adjusts the\nnoose and kicks the chair out from under her.\n\nTwo [Scotland Yard](/wiki/Scotland_Yard \"Scotland Yard\") officials are puzzled\nby the identity of U N Owen. Although they can partially reconstruct the\ndeaths from Marston to Wargrave with the help of the victims' diaries and a\n[coroner](/wiki/Coroner \"Coroner\")'s careful report, they conclude that U N\nOwen was one of the victims, but are unable to determine which one. The chair\non which Vera stood to hang herself had been set back upright, indicating that\nsomeone was still alive on the island after her suicide, presumably the\nkiller.\n\nPostscript from the Killer\n\nIn a postscript, a fishing ship [picks up a bottle](/wiki/Message_in_a_bottle\n\"Message in a bottle\") inside its trawling nets; the bottle contains a written\nconfession of the killings, which is then sent to Scotland Yard. It is not\nclear how long after the killings the bottle was discovered.\n\nIn the confession, Justice Wargrave writes that he has long wished to set an\nunsolvable puzzle of murder. His victims would be of his choosing, as they\nwere not found guilty in a trial. He explains how he tricked Dr Armstrong into\nhelping him fake his own death under the pretext that it would help the group\nidentify the killer. He also explains that he replaced the chair in Vera's\nroom. Finally, he reveals how he used the gun and some elastic to ensure his\nown death matched the account in the guests' diaries. Although he wished to\ncreate an unsolvable mystery, he acknowledges in the missive a \"pitiful human\nneed\" for recognition, hence the confession.\n\nHe describes how his first victim was Isaac Morris, the sleazy lawyer and\ndrugs trafficker who anonymously purchased the island and arranged the\ninvitations on his behalf, making nine murders and two suicides. Morris was\npoisoned before Wargrave departed for the island. Wargrave's intention is to\nstymie the police as to which person on the island was the murderer. He states\nthat, although there are three clues that could guide the police to the\ncorrect killer, he is confident they will be unable to find them and that the\nmystery will remain unsolved until the confession is read.\n\n##\nCharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Characters\")]\n\nThe following details of the characters are based on the original novel\npublished in England.\n\n  * **Anthony James Marston** , an amoral and irresponsible young man, killed two young children (John and Lucy Combes) while driving recklessly, for which he felt no real remorse and accepted no personal responsibility, complaining only that his driving licence had been suspended as a result. He was the first island victim.\n  * **Mrs Ethel Rogers** , the cook/housekeeper and Thomas Rogers' wife, described as a pale and ghost-like woman who walks in mortal fear. She was dominated by her bullying husband, who coerced her into agreeing to withhold the medicine of a former employer (Miss Jennifer Brady, an elderly spinster) in order that they might collect an inheritance they knew she had left them in her will. Mrs Rogers was the second victim.\n  * **General John Gordon MacArthur** , a retired [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\") war hero, who sent his late wife's lover (a younger officer, Arthur Richmond) to his death by assigning him to a mission where it was practically guaranteed he would not survive. Leslie MacArthur had mistakenly put the wrong letters in the envelopes on one occasion when she wrote to both men at the same time. The general tells Vera that no one will leave the island alive.\n  * **Thomas Rogers** , the butler and Ethel Rogers' husband. He dominated his weak-willed wife, and they killed their former elderly employer by withholding her medicine, causing the woman to die from heart failure, thus inheriting the money she bequeathed them in her will. Despite his wife's death, Rogers was still serving the others.\n  * **Emily Caroline Brent** , an elderly, religiously rigid, socially respectable spinster who accepted the vacation on Soldier Island largely due to financial constraints. Years earlier, she had dismissed her teenage maid, Beatrice Taylor, for becoming [pregnant out of wedlock](/wiki/Unintended_pregnancy \"Unintended pregnancy\"). Beatrice, who had already been rejected by her parents for the same reason, drowned herself, which Miss Brent considered an even worse sin. The murderer put a bee into the room, in addition to murder by poison. (\"A bumblebee stung one...\")\n  * **Dr Edward George Armstrong** , a [Harley Street](/wiki/Harley_Street \"Harley Street\") doctor, responsible for the death of a patient, Louisa Mary Clees, after he operated on her while drunk many years earlier.\n  * **William Henry Blore** , a former [police inspector](/wiki/Police_inspector \"Police inspector\") and now a private investigator, was accused of [falsifying his testimony in court](/wiki/Perjury \"Perjury\") for a bribe from a dangerous criminal gang, which resulted in an innocent man, James Landor, being convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Landor, who had a wife and young child, died shortly afterwards in prison. He arrived under the alias \"Davis\" from South Africa, on the island for \"security work\". His true name is revealed on the gramophone recording. He denies the accusation against him from the gramophone recording, but later admits the truth to Lombard.\n  * **Philip Lombard** , a [soldier of fortune](/wiki/Mercenary \"Mercenary\"). Literally down to his last square meal, he comes to the island with a loaded revolver, as suggested by his invitation letter. Lombard is accused of causing the deaths of a number of East African tribesmen, after stealing their food and abandoning them to their deaths. Neither he nor Marston feels any remorse. He is the only one to theorize that U N Owen might be Wargrave, but the others reject this. He and Vera are the only victims not killed by Justice Wargrave.\n  * **Vera Elizabeth Claythorne** , a cool, efficient, resourceful young woman who is on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a third-rate girls' school. Her job as a governess was ended by the death of her charge, Cyril Hamilton. Claythorne let the boy drown so his uncle Hugo Hamilton could inherit the family estate and marry her. Hugo rejected her when he somehow realized what she had done.\n  * **Justice Lawrence John Wargrave** , a retired judge, known as a \"[hanging judge](/wiki/Hanging_judge \"Hanging judge\")\" for liberally awarding the [death penalty](/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_Kingdom \"Capital punishment in the United Kingdom\") in murder cases. Wargrave is accused of influencing the jury to hand a guilty verdict to Edward Seton, a man many thought was innocent of his crime of killing an old woman, and sentencing him to death unfairly. As the two policemen discuss at Scotland Yard, new evidence after Seton's execution proved Seton's guilt. He admits in his postscript that he has a lifelong hidden sadistic urge to kill, but only the guilty. Finding himself terminally ill, he devises and carries out this plot.\n  * **Isaac Morris** is an unethical lawyer hired by Wargrave to purchase the island (under the name U N Owen), arrange the gramophone recording, and make arrangements on his behalf, including gathering information on the near destitute Philip Lombard, to whom he gave some money to get by and recommended Lombard bring his gun to the island. Morris's is the first death, as he died before the guests arrived on the island. Morris was responsible for the addiction and suicide of a young woman through his [narcotics](/wiki/Narcotics \"Narcotics\") activities. The victim was the daughter of a friend of Wargrave. He accepts Wargrave's lethal cocktail of pills, as something that would help him.\n  * **Fred Narracott** , the boatman who delivered the guests to the island. After doing so, he does not appear again in the story, although Inspector Maine notes it was Narracott who, sensing something seriously amiss, returned to the island as soon as the weather allowed, before he was scheduled to do, and found the bodies. Maine speculates that it was the normalcy and ordinariness of the guests that convinced Narracott to do so and ignore his orders to dismiss any signals requesting help.\n  * **Sir Thomas Legge** and **Inspector Maine** , two [Scotland Yard](/wiki/Scotland_Yard \"Scotland Yard\") detectives who discuss the case in the epilogue. They reason out the events of the case, but are stymied as to which was the murderer until the confession comes to light.\n\n## Literary significance and\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Literary significance and reception\")]\n\nWriting for _[The Times Literary\nSupplement](/wiki/The_Times_Literary_Supplement \"The Times Literary\nSupplement\")_ of 11 November 1939, Maurice Percy Ashley stated, \"If her latest\nstory has scarcely any detection in it there is no scarcity of murders...\nThere is a certain feeling of monotony inescapable in the regularity of the\ndeaths which is better suited to a serialized newspaper story than a full-\nlength novel. Yet there is an ingenious problem to solve in naming the\nmurderer\", he continued. \"It will be an extremely astute reader who guesses\ncorrectly.\"[9]\n\nFor _[The New York Times Book Review](/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Book_Review\n\"The New York Times Book Review\")_ (25 February 1940), Isaac Anderson has\narrived to the point where \"the voice\" accuses the ten \"guests\" of their past\ncrimes, which have all resulted in the deaths of human, and then said, \"When\nyou read what happens after that you will not believe it, but you will keep on\nreading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more\nincredible you will still keep on reading. The whole thing is utterly\nimpossible and utterly fascinating. It is the most baffling mystery that\nAgatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed\nit for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory. We are referring, of\ncourse, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has. It is a\ntall story, to be sure, but it could have happened.\"[10]\n\nMany compared the book to her novel _[The Murder of Roger\nAckroyd](/wiki/The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\")_\n(1926). For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the _[Toronto Daily\nStar](/wiki/Toronto_Star \"Toronto Star\")_ of 16 March 1940 said, \"Others have\nwritten better mysteries than Agatha Christie, but no one can touch her for\ningenious plot and surprise ending. With _And Then There Were None_... she is\nat her most ingenious and most surprising... is, indeed, considerably above\nthe standard of her last few works and close to the _Roger Ackroyd_\nlevel.\"[11]\n\nOther critics laud the use of plot twists and [surprise\nendings](/wiki/Surprise_ending \"Surprise ending\"). Maurice Richardson wrote a\nrhapsodic review in _[The Observer](/wiki/The_Observer \"The Observer\")'_s\nissue of 5 November 1939 which began, \"No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has\nsent her publishers into a [vatic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Vatic\n\"wikt:Vatic\") trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons\nwith _Roger Ackroyd_ and be content with saying that _Ten Little Niggers_ is\none of the very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We\nwill also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of\nshocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from\nsomebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept\nfresh than criticism pure.\" After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson\nconcluded, \"Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs\nChristie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat,\nbrilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-\nherring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work.\"[3]\n\n[Robert Barnard](/wiki/Robert_Barnard \"Robert Barnard\"), a recent critic,\nconcurred with the reviews, describing the book as \"Suspenseful and menacing\ndetective-story-cum-thriller. The closed setting with the succession of deaths\nis here taken to its logical conclusion, and the dangers of ludicrousness and\nsheer reader-disbelief are skillfully avoided. Probably the best-known\nChristie, and justifiably among the most popular.\"[12]\n\nThe original title of the mystery (_Ten Little Niggers_) has been changed\nbecause it was offensive in English-speaking countries and some others. Few\ncritics have opined that Christie's original title and the setting on \"Nigger\nIsland\" (later changed to \"Indian Island\" and \"Soldier Island\", variously) may\nbe integral to the work. These aspects of the novel, argues Alison Light,\n\"could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a\nplace where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be\nappropriate.\"[13] Unlike novels such as _[Heart of\nDarkness](/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness \"Heart of Darkness\")_ , \"Christie's location\nis both more domesticated and privatized, taking for granted the construction\nof racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery. If her story\nsuggests how easy it is to play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how\nintimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment.\"[13]\n\nIn the \"Binge!\" article of _[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly\n\"Entertainment Weekly\")_ Issue #1343-44 (26 December 2014–3 January 2015), the\nwriters picked _And Then There Were None_ as an \"EW favorite\" on the list of\nthe \"Nine Great Christie Novels\".[14]\n\n## Current published version of the\nrhyme[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Current published version of the rhyme\")]\n\nMain article: [Ten Little Injuns](/wiki/Ten_Little_Injuns \"Ten Little Injuns\")\n\nTen little Soldier Boys went out to dine;  \nOne choked his little self and then there were nine.  \n  \nNine little Soldier Boys sat up very late;  \nOne overslept himself and then there were eight.  \n  \nEight little Soldier Boys travelling in Devon;  \nOne said he'd stay there and then there were seven.[15]  \n  \nSeven little Soldier Boys chopping up sticks;  \nOne chopped himself in halves and then there were six.  \n  \nSix little Soldier Boys playing with a hive;  \nA [bumblebee](/wiki/Bumblebee \"Bumblebee\") stung one and then there were five.  \n  \nFive little Soldier Boys going in for law;  \nOne got in [Chancery](/wiki/Court_of_Chancery \"Court of Chancery\") and then\nthere were four.  \n  \nFour little Soldier Boys going out to sea;  \nA [red herring](/wiki/Red_herring_\\(narrative\\) \"Red herring \\(narrative\\)\")\nswallowed one and then there were three.  \n  \nThree little Soldier Boys walking in the zoo;  \nA big bear hugged one and then there were two.  \n  \nTwo little Soldier Boys sitting in the sun;  \nOne got frizzled up and then there was one.[16]  \n  \nOne little Soldier Boy left all alone;  \nHe went out and hanged himself and then there were none.[17]\n\n### 19th Century original\nverses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 19th Century original verses\")]\n\nThis children's rhyme was originally written as songs in the 19th century, one\nin Britain in 1869[18] and one in the US in 1868.[19]\n\n1869 & 1868 verses\n\nTen Little Niggers  \n(Frank Green)[18] | Ten Little Indians  \n(Septimus Winner)[19]  \n---|---  \nTen little nigger boys went out to dine  \nOne choked his little self, and then there were nine.

In the UK it\nappeared under the title _Ten Little Niggers_ , in book and newspaper\nserialized formats. The serialization was in 23 parts in the _[Daily\nExpress](/wiki/Daily_Express \"Daily Express\")_ from Tuesday 6 June to Saturday\n1 July 1939. All of the instalments carried an illustration by \"Prescott\" with\nthe first having an illustration of [Burgh Island](/wiki/Burgh_Island \"Burgh\nIsland\") in Devon which inspired the setting of the story. The serialized\nversion did not contain any chapter divisions.[20] The book retailed for seven\nshillings and six pence.\n\nIn the United States it was published under the title _And Then There Were\nNone_ , again in both book and serial formats. Both of the original US\npublications changed the title from that originally used in the UK, due to the\noffensiveness of the word [in American\nculture](/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States \"Racism in the United States\"),\nwhere it was more widely perceived as a [racially\nloaded](/wiki/Loaded_language \"Loaded language\") ethnic slur or insult\ncompared to contemporary UK culture, rather than a fairly innocent rhyme for\nchildren to use when selecting one child for a game. The serialized version\nappeared in the _[Saturday Evening Post](/wiki/Saturday_Evening_Post \"Saturday\nEvening Post\")_ in seven parts from 20 May (Volume 211, Number 47) to 1 July\n1939 (Volume 212, Number 1) with illustrations by Henry Raleigh, and the book\nwas published in January 1940 by [Dodd, Mead and\nCompany](/wiki/Dodd,_Mead_and_Company \"Dodd, Mead and Company\") for\n$2.[4][5][6]\n\nIn the original UK novel all references to \"Indians\" or \"Soldiers\" were\noriginally \"Nigger\", including the island's name, the pivotal rhyme found by\nthe visitors, and the ten figurines.[5] (In Chapter 7, Vera Claythorne becomes\nsemi-hysterical at the mention by Miss Brent of \"our black brothers\", which is\nunderstandable only in the context of the original name.) UK editions changed\nto the current definitive title in 1985.[21] The word \"[nigger](/wiki/Nigger\n\"Nigger\")\" was already racially offensive in the United States by the start of\nthe 20th century, and therefore the book's first US edition and first\nserialization changed the title to _And Then There Were None_ and removed all\nreferences to the word from the book, as did the 1945 motion\npicture.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Publication\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Publication history\")]\n\nThis is the best selling crime novel of all time, and what makes Agatha\nChristie the best selling novelist.[2] It is Christie's best-selling novel,\nwith more than 100 million copies sold; it is also the world's best-selling\nmystery and one of the [best-selling books](/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books\n\"List of best-selling books\") of all time.

(Last publication of novel under the title _Ten Little Indians_.)\n\nForeign language editions\n\nThe sensitivity of the original British title varies across nations, depending\non their culture and which words are used to describe people by skin color. In\nthe US, the British title was considered offensive at first publication, and\nchanged to the last line of the rhyme instead of its title. As the estate of\nAgatha Christie now offers it under one title only in English, _And Then There\nWere None_ , it is likely that new foreign language editions will match that\ntitle in their language.[2] The original title (_Ten Little Niggers_) still\nsurvives in a few foreign-language versions of the novel, such as the\nBulgarian title _Десет малки негърчета_ , and was used in other languages for\na time, for example in Dutch until the 1994 release of the 18th\nedition.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The title _Ten Little Negroes_ continues to be\ncommonly used in foreign-language versions, for example in Spanish, Greek,\nSerbian, Romanian,[23] French[24] and Hungarian, as well as a 1987 [Russian\nfilm](/wiki/Russian_film \"Russian film\") adaptation _[Десять негритят (Desyat\nNegrityat)](/wiki/Desyat_Negrityat \"Desyat Negrityat\")_. In 1999, the [Slovak\nNational Theatre](/wiki/Slovak_National_Theatre \"Slovak National Theatre\")\nstaged the play under its original title but changed to _A napokon nezostal už\nnik_ (_And Then There Were None_) mid-run.[25]\n\n## Possible\ninspirations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Possible inspirations\")]\n\nThe 1930 novel _[The Invisible Host](/wiki/The_Invisible_Host \"The Invisible\nHost\")_ by [Gwen Bristow](/wiki/Gwen_Bristow \"Gwen Bristow\") and [Bruce\nManning](/wiki/Bruce_Manning \"Bruce Manning\") has a plot that strongly matches\nthat of Christie's later novel, including a recorded voice announcing to the\nguests that their sins will be visited upon them by death. _The Invisible\nHost_ was adapted as the 1930 [Broadway](/wiki/Broadway_theatre \"Broadway\ntheatre\") _[The Ninth Guest](/wiki/The_Ninth_Guest \"The Ninth Guest\")_ by\n[Owen Davis](/wiki/Owen_Davis \"Owen Davis\"),[26] which itself was adapted as\nthe 1934 film _The Ninth Guest_.\n\nThe 1933 [K.B.S. Productions](/wiki/Sono_Art-World_Wide_Pictures \"Sono Art-\nWorld Wide Pictures\") _[Sherlock Holmes](/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes \"Sherlock\nHolmes\")_ film _[A Study in Scarlet](/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet_\\(1933_film\\) \"A\nStudy in Scarlet \\(1933 film\\)\")_ follows a strikingly similar plot;[27] it\nincludes a scene where Holmes is shown a card with the hint: \"Six little\nIndians ....bee stung one and then there were five\". In this case, the rhyme\nrefers to \"Ten Little Fat Boys\". (The film's plot bears no resemblance to\n[Arthur Conan Doyle](/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle \"Arthur Conan Doyle\")'s original\n[story of the same name](/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet \"A Study in Scarlet\").) The\nauthor of the movie's screenplay, [Robert Florey](/wiki/Robert_Florey \"Robert\nFlorey\"), \"doubted that [Christie] had seen _A Study in Scarlet_ , but he\nregarded it as a compliment if it had helped inspire her\".[28]\n\n##\nAdaptations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Adaptations\")]\n\n_And Then There Were None_ has had more adaptations than any other single work\nby [Agatha Christie](/wiki/Agatha_Christie \"Agatha Christie\"). It is the\nisolated location where all the players on scene are murdered, never knowing\nwho their murderer is, that is the idea. \"It was an idea which is now the\nbasis for many Hollywood horror films and has become a cliché to modern\naudiences, but it was Agatha Christie who was the first to do it and so\nsuccessfully that the story has become her most adapted piece.\"[2] She changed\nthe bleak ending to a more palatable one for theatre audiences when she\nadapted the novel for the stage in 1943. Many adaptations incorporate changes\nto the story, such as using Christie's alternative ending from her stage play\nor changing the setting to locations other than an island.\n\nWith a plot line so well-known, parodies and references to the novel or the\nplay are frequent. Many television programs use the essence of the plot, a\ngroup of characters cut off from the outside world with a murderer in their\nmidst, but with innocent victims in place of guilty victims, and give no\ncredit to Agatha Christie for the many differences in plot and motivation.\n\n###\nFilm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Film\")]\n\nThere have been numerous film adaptations of the novel, some comedic. Examples\ninclude:\n\n  * [_And Then There Were None_ (1945 film)](/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_\\(1945_film\\) \"And Then There Were None \\(1945 film\\)\"), [René Clair](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Clair \"René Clair\")'s cinema adaptation, was a successful US production\n  * [_Ten Little Indians_ (1965 film)](/wiki/Ten_Little_Indians_\\(1965_film\\) \"Ten Little Indians \\(1965 film\\)\"), is [George Pollock](/wiki/George_Pollock_\\(director\\) \"George Pollock \\(director\\)\")'s cinema adaptation\n  * _[Gumnaam](/wiki/Gumnaam \"Gumnaam\")_ (1965, translation: _Unknown_ or _Anonymous_) is an Indian suspense thriller film adaptation.\n  * _[Five Dolls for an August Moon](/wiki/Five_Dolls_for_an_August_Moon \"Five Dolls for an August Moon\")_ (1970) is a loose Italian _[giallo](/wiki/Giallo \"Giallo\")_ adaptation directed by [Mario Bava](/wiki/Mario_Bava \"Mario Bava\").[29]\n  * _[Nadu Iravil](/wiki/Nadu_Iravil \"Nadu Iravil\")_ (1970, translation: _In the middle of the night_), a Tamil adaptation directed by [Sundaram Balachander](/wiki/Sundaram_Balachander \"Sundaram Balachander\")[30]\n  * [_And Then There Were None_ (1974 film)](/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_\\(1974_film\\) \"And Then There Were None \\(1974 film\\)\"), the first English-language colour version, directed by [Peter Collinson](/wiki/Peter_Collinson_\\(film_director\\) \"Peter Collinson \\(film director\\)\")\n  * _[Desyat' Negrityat](/wiki/Desyat_Negrityat \"Desyat Negrityat\")_ (1987, _Десять негритят_ , Eng: \"Ten Little Negroes\") [Stanislav Govorukhin](/wiki/Stanislav_Govorukhin \"Stanislav Govorukhin\")'s Russian adaptation keeps intact Christie's grim storyline and ending.\n  * _[Ten Little Indians](/wiki/Ten_Little_Indians_\\(1989_film\\) \"Ten Little Indians \\(1989 film\\)\")_ , a 1989 American version directed by [Alan Birkinshaw](/wiki/Alan_Birkinshaw \"Alan Birkinshaw\")\n  * _[Aduthathu](/wiki/Aduthathu \"Aduthathu\")_ (2012) is a Tamil adaptation[31]\n  * _[Aatagara](/wiki/Aatagara \"Aatagara\")_ (2015) is a Kannada film adaptation[32]\n\n###\nRadio[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Radio\")]\n\n  * The BBC broadcast \"Ten Little Niggers\" (1947), adapted by [Ayton Whitaker](/wiki/Ayton_Whitaker \"Ayton Whitaker\"), first aired as a Monday Matinee on the [BBC Home Service](/wiki/BBC_Home_Service \"BBC Home Service\") on 27 December 1947 and as [Saturday Night Theatre](/wiki/Saturday_Night_Theatre \"Saturday Night Theatre\") on the [BBC Light Programme](/wiki/BBC_Light_Programme \"BBC Light Programme\") on 29 December.[33]\n  * On 13 November 2010, as part of its _Saturday Play_ series, [BBC Radio 4](/wiki/BBC_Radio_4 \"BBC Radio 4\") broadcast a 90-minute adaptation written by [Joy Wilkinson](/w/index.php?title=Joy_Wilkinson&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Joy Wilkinson \\(page does not exist\\)\"). The production was directed by [Mary Peate](/w/index.php?title=Mary_Peate&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Mary Peate \\(page does not exist\\)\") and featured, among others, [Geoffrey Whitehead](/wiki/Geoffrey_Whitehead \"Geoffrey Whitehead\") as Justice Wargrave, [Lyndsey Marshal](/wiki/Lyndsey_Marshal \"Lyndsey Marshal\") as Vera Claythorne, [Alex Wyndham](/wiki/Alex_Wyndham \"Alex Wyndham\") as Philip Lombard, [John Rowe](/wiki/John_Rowe_\\(actor\\) \"John Rowe \\(actor\\)\") as Dr. Armstrong, and [Joanna Monro](/wiki/Joanna_Monro \"Joanna Monro\") as Emily Brent. In this production, which is extremely faithful to the novel, the rhyme is \"Ten Little Soldier Boys\".[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n###\nStage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Stage\")]\n\n  * [_And Then There Were None_ (1943 play)](/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_\\(1943_play\\) \"And Then There Were None \\(1943 play\\)\") is Christie's adaptation of the story for the stage. She and the producers agreed that audiences might not flock to a tale with such a grim ending as the novel, nor would it work well dramatically as there would be no one left to tell the story. Thus, she reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused, survive, and fall in love with each other. Some of the names were also changed, e.g., General Macarthur became General McKenzie in both the New York and London productions.[34][35] By 1943, General [Douglas MacArthur](/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur \"Douglas MacArthur\") was playing a prominent role in the [Pacific Theatre](/wiki/Pacific_War \"Pacific War\") of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), which may explain the change of the character's name. Regardless of the reason, it was changed.\n  * _Ten little niggers_ (1944 play), [Dundee Repertory Theatre Company](/wiki/Dundee_Repertory_Theatre \"Dundee Repertory Theatre\") was given special permission to restore the original ending of the novel. The company first performed a stage adaptation of the novel in August 1944 under the UK title of the novel, with Agatha Christie credited as the dramatist.[36] It was the first performance in repertory theatre.[36] It was staged again in 1965.[37] There was an article in the Dundee Evening Register in August 1944\n  * _And Then There Were None_ (2005 play), On 14 October 2005, a new version of the play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by [Steven Pimlott](/wiki/Steven_Pimlott \"Steven Pimlott\"), opened at the [Gielgud Theatre](/wiki/Gielgud_Theatre \"Gielgud Theatre\") in London. For this version, Elyot returned to the original story in the novel, restoring the nihilism of the original.[38]\n\n###\nTelevision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Television\")]\n\nSeveral variations of the original novel were adapted for television, three of\nwhich were British adaptations. The first of these, in 1949, was produced by\nthe BBC.[39] The second was produced in 1959,[40] by ITV. Both of those\nproductions aired with Christie's original title. The third and most recent\nBritish adaptation aired as [_And Then There Were\nNone_](/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_\\(miniseries\\) \"And Then There Were None\n\\(miniseries\\)\") on [BBC One](/wiki/BBC_One \"BBC One\") in December 2015, as a\n[mini-series](/wiki/Mini-series \"Mini-series\") produced in cooperation with\nAcorn Media and Agatha Christie Productions. The 2015 production adhered more\nclosely to the original plot, though there were several differences, and was\nthe first English language film adaptation to feature an ending similar to\nthat of the novel.[41]\n\nOn 25 and 26 March 2017 [TV Asahi](/wiki/TV_Asahi \"TV Asahi\") in\n[Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") aired そして誰もいなくなった (_Soshite daremo inakunatta_),\na Japanese language adaptation by Nagasaka Shukei (長坂秀佳) of the original story\nset in modern times.[42][43]\n\n### Other\nmedia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Other media\")]\n\nThe novel has been the inspiration for several video games. For the [Apple\nII](/wiki/Apple_II \"Apple II\"), [Online Systems](/wiki/Online_Systems \"Online\nSystems\") released the game [Mystery House](/wiki/Mystery_House \"Mystery\nHouse\") in 1980. On the PC, [The Adventure\nCompany](/wiki/The_Adventure_Company \"The Adventure Company\") released the\nvideo game _[Agatha Christie: And Then There Were\nNone](/wiki/Agatha_Christie:_And_Then_There_Were_None \"Agatha Christie: And\nThen There Were None\")_ in 2005, the first in a series of [PC games based on\nChristie novels](/wiki/Agatha_Christie_\\(video_game_series\\) \"Agatha Christie\n\\(video game series\\)\"). In February 2008, it was ported to the\n[Wii](/wiki/Wii \"Wii\") console. The identity of the murderer is not that of\nthe killer in the original book. The game player assumes the role of Patrick\nNaracott (brother of Fred Naracott, who is involved in a newly created\nsubplot), who is stranded with the others when his boat is scuttled. This\nallows for alternate, more successful endings in which Naracott survives and\nis able to prevent the murders of the innocent Lombard and Claythorne. All\nendings depart markedly from the novel and previous adaptations in that the\nkiller and motives are different.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n_And Then There Were None_ was released by [HarperCollins](/wiki/HarperCollins\n\"HarperCollins\") as a [graphic novel](/wiki/Graphic_novel \"Graphic novel\")\nadaptation on 30 April 2009, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by\nFrank Leclercq.\n\nPeká Editorial released a [board game](/wiki/Board_game \"Board game\") based on\nthe book, created by Judit Hurtado and Fernando Chavarría, and illustrated by\nEsperanza Peinado.[44]\n\n### Timeline of\nadaptations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=And_Then_There_Were_None&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Timeline of adaptations\")]\n\ntype | Title | Year | Notes   \n---|---|---|---  \nFilm | _[And Then There Were None](/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_\\(1945_film\\) \"And Then There Were None \\(1945 film\\)\")_ | 1945 | American film and first cinema adaptation.
