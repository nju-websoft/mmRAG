At the beginning of the film, she is voiced by [Eva\nBella](/wiki/Eva_Bella \"Eva Bella\") as a young child and by Spencer Lacey\nGanus as a teenager.\n\nCreated by directors [Chris Buck](/wiki/Chris_Buck \"Chris Buck\") and [Jennifer\nLee](/wiki/Jennifer_Lee_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Jennifer Lee \\(filmmaker\\)\"), Elsa is\nloosely based on the title character of \"[The Snow Queen](/wiki/The_Snow_Queen\n\"The Snow Queen\")\", a Danish fairytale by [Hans Christian\nAndersen](/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen \"Hans Christian Andersen\"). In the\nDisney film adaptation, she is introduced as the princess of the fictional\n[Scandinavian](/wiki/Scandinavia \"Scandinavia\") kingdom of Arendelle, heiress\nto the throne and the elder sister of [Princess Anna](/wiki/Anna_\\(Disney\\)\n\"Anna \\(Disney\\)\") ([Kristen Bell](/wiki/Kristen_Bell \"Kristen Bell\")). Elsa\nhas the magical ability to create and manipulate ice and snow. She\ninadvertently sends Arendelle into an eternal winter on the evening of her\ncoronation. Throughout the film, she struggles first with controlling and\nconcealing her abilities and then with liberating herself from her fears of\nunintentionally harming others, especially her younger sister.\n\nThe Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the original fairytale\nand villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to\nadapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film executives,\nincluding [Walt Disney](/wiki/Walt_Disney \"Walt Disney\"), attempted to build\non the character, and a number of scheduled film adaptions were shelved when\nthey could not work out the character. Buck and his co-director, [Jennifer\nLee](/wiki/Jennifer_Lee_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Jennifer Lee \\(filmmaker\\)\"), were\nultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters. As\nmuch as Anna’s struggle is external, Elsa’s is internal. This led to Elsa\nbeing gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.\n\nElsa has received largely positive reception from reviewers, who praised her\ncomplex characterization and vulnerability. Menzel was also widely praised for\nher vocal performance of Elsa, especially that of her performance of the song\n\"[Let It Go](/wiki/Let_It_Go_\\(Disney_song\\) \"Let It Go \\(Disney song\\)\")\",\nwith critics frequently calling her a \"powerhouse\".[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Development\n    * 1.1 Origins and concept\n    * 1.2 Voice\n      * 1.2.1 Other voices\n    * 1.3 Design and characterization\n      * 1.3.1 Abilities\n  * 2 Appearances\n    * 2.1 _Frozen_\n    * 2.2 _Frozen Fever_\n    * 2.3 _Once Upon a Time_\n    * 2.4 _Olaf 's Frozen Adventure_\n    * 2.5 Miscellaneous\n      * 2.5.1 Merchandise\n      * 2.5.2 Theme parks\n      * 2.5.3 Cosplay\n      * 2.5.4 Broadway musical\n  * 3 Reception\n    * 3.1 Critical reviews\n      * 3.1.1 \"Let It Go\"\n    * 3.2 Accolades\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n### Origins and\nconcept[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Origins and concept\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/The_Snow_Queen_by_Elena_Ringo.jpg/250px-\nThe_Snow_Queen_by_Elena_Ringo.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Snow_Queen_by_Elena_Ringo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Snow_Queen_by_Elena_Ringo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn illustration of [the Snow Queen](/wiki/The_Snow_Queen \"The Snow Queen\"),\nthe character Elsa is based upon.\n\nAttempts were made as early as 1937 by [Walt Disney](/wiki/Walt_Disney \"Walt\nDisney\") to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, \"The Snow Queen\", into\na film. The tale focuses on two children, one named Gerda, who served as the\nbasis for Princess Anna, and the other named Kai, who is \"cursed with\nnegativity\" after his heart is pierced with a shard of glass from an enchanted\nmirror and is later kidnapped by the Snow Queen.[3][4] However, Disney\nstruggled with creating a believable, multi-dimensional adaption of the fairy\ntale's title character,[5] who was intended to be a villain.[6] In the story,\nshe is described as \"a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked\nlike millions of starry snow-flakes linked together. She was fair and\nbeautiful, but made of ice—shining and glittering ice. Still she was alive and\nher eyes sparkled like bright stars, but there was neither peace nor rest in\ntheir glance.\"[5] Disney was unable to find a way to make the Snow Queen more\nreal and eventually abandoned film plans.[5]\n\nSeveral film executives later made efforts towards the project, including\n[Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi](/wiki/Paul_and_Ga%C3%ABtan_Brizzi \"Paul and Gaëtan\nBrizzi\"), Dick Zondag, [Glen Keane](/wiki/Glen_Keane \"Glen Keane\"), and Dave\nGoetz. In 2011, director [Chris Buck](/wiki/Chris_Buck \"Chris Buck\") began\nwork on another attempted adaption and also faced challenges with the Snow\nQueen character. Producer Peter Del Vecho explained that this was primarily\nbecause she was not relatable and too isolated, having no personal\nconnections. As a result, they could not explain her motivations. After\nseveral changes were proposed, someone on the writing team suggested making\nthe Snow Queen Anna's sister. \"Once we realized that these characters could be\nsiblings and have a relationship, everything changed,\" Del Vecho relayed.[5]\n\nThe Snow Queen, now given the name Elsa, continued to be cast as a villain,[7]\nand Disney released the following synopsis for _Frozen_ in May 2013:\n\n> When Anna is cursed by her estranged sister, the cold-hearted Snow Queen,\n> Anna's only hope of reversing the curse is to survive a perilous but\n> thrilling journey across an icy and unforgiving landscape. Joined by a\n> rugged, thrill-seeking outdoorsman, his one-antlered reindeer and a hapless\n> snowman, Anna must race against time, conquer the elements and battle an\n> army of menacing snowmen if she ever hopes to melt her frozen heart.[3]\n\nEarlier manuscripts included more antagonistic actions by Elsa, such as\nintentionally cursing Arendelle with an eternal winter. Additionally, she is\nshown creating an army of snowmen similar to the original Snow Queen's army of\nsnowflakes; the comedic character of [Olaf](/wiki/Olaf_\\(Disney\\) \"Olaf\n\\(Disney\\)\") was at the time written as a smaller snowman who was cast out by\nElsa for being too unintimidating.[3][8] Within two months, however, scripts\nwere altered to give emphasis to her lack of control over her powers.[9] Olaf\nwas reduced to the only snowman created by Elsa, and he instead serves as a\nreminder of the sisters' childhood friendship.[10] In the final version, Elsa\ncreates a single giant snow creature that Olaf nicknames \"Marshmallow\" to act\nas a guard after being branded as a monster for her powers.[9] According to\ndirector Jennifer Lee, the character ultimately became more of a composite of\nboth Kai and the Snow Queen, enhancing her increasingly sympathetic\nportrayal.[4] Del Vecho added, \"There are times when Elsa does villainous\nthings but because you understand where it comes from, from this desire to\ndefend herself, you can always relate to her.\"[11]\n\n### Voice[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Voice\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Idina_Menzel_Defense.gov_Crop.png/200px-\nIdina_Menzel_Defense.gov_Crop.png)](/wiki/File:Idina_Menzel_Defense.gov_Crop.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Idina_Menzel_Defense.gov_Crop.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Idina Menzel](/wiki/Idina_Menzel \"Idina Menzel\") provided both the singing\nand speaking voice of Elsa.\n\n[Eva Bella](/wiki/Eva_Bella \"Eva Bella\") and Spencer Lacey Ganus were cast to\nportray Elsa as a young child and as a teenager, respectively.[12][13] Actress\nand singer [Megan Mullally](/wiki/Megan_Mullally \"Megan Mullally\") was\noriginally cast to voice an adult Elsa.[14] but was replaced by [Idina\nMenzel](/wiki/Idina_Menzel \"Idina Menzel\"), a Broadway actress and singer best\nknown for performing as [Elphaba](/wiki/Elphaba \"Elphaba\") in\n[_Wicked_](/wiki/Wicked_\\(musical\\) \"Wicked \\(musical\\)\").[2] Menzel already\nknew [Kristen Bell](/wiki/Kristen_Bell \"Kristen Bell\"),[15] who voiced Anna,\nand had previously auditioned for a lead role in the 2010 Disney film\n_[Tangled](/wiki/Tangled \"Tangled\")_.[16] She was not cast for the part, but\nthe casting director recorded her singing and later showed the recording to\n_Frozen_ 's film executives.[16] Menzel was surprised when she was\nsubsequently asked to audition,[16] and she received the role after reading\nthe script out loud.[15] In interviews, she acknowledged similarities between\nElsa, her then-current role, and Elphaba, her previous role.[17] Namely, she\nsaid, they were both very powerful and very misunderstood individuals.[18] She\nfurther said that she related to the characters, having hidden her singing\ntalent from her peers at school. \"I didn't want to alienate anyone,\" she\nexplained. \"If everyone was singing along in the car to a Madonna song, I\ndidn't join in because when we're younger we're afraid of sticking out or\nshowing off, when in fact we should own those things that make us really\nunique.\"[2]\n\nDirector Chris Buck believed that Menzel's vocals would help in the portrayal\nof the character, saying, \"Idina has a sense of vulnerability in her voice.\nShe plays a very strong character, but someone who lives in fear—so we needed\nsomeone who could portray both sides of the character, and Idina was just\namazing.\"[19] Menzel was unaccustomed to working with animated films and being\nrequired to portray her character's feelings with her voice alone, though she\ndid not find it particularly challenging.[18] While recording, she was able to\n\"play\" with her voice, trying various tones to establish the ranges in Elsa's\nemotions. For example, Menzel wanted there to be a difference between the ways\nshe sounded when she was being bold and when she was angry.[15] She would also\nphysically restrict her hands from moving as she recorded the film's early\nscenes in order to project how her character was \"so afraid to move and feel\nanything that it would come out and hurt people\".[20]\n\nDuring production, Menzel and [Jonathan Groff](/wiki/Jonathan_Groff \"Jonathan\nGroff\"), who portrays Kristoff, went to the animation studio to explain to the\nanimators how they were approaching their characters.[21] Animators asked\nMenzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang\nlive, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated\nElsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism.[20][22] Her\nvoice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, \"Let It Go\".\nAccording to composer [Robert Lopez](/wiki/Robert_Lopez \"Robert Lopez\"),\nMenzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's \"low, vulnerable,\nfragile side\" as well as her power and self-realization.[23] Menzel commented\nthat it was \"an honor\" to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it.\n\"It's a collision of a bunch of forces that are all coming together in the\nright way,\" she explained. \"The character, what she is singing and what she is\nexperiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody and a little bit of me.\"[20]\nBuck and Lee were also surprised by how compatible Menzel and Kristen Bell's\nvoices were. At one point during a table read, they sang a ballad (later\nrevealed as \"[Wind Beneath My Wings](/wiki/Wind_Beneath_My_Wings \"Wind Beneath\nMy Wings\")\"[24]) back and forth to one another with so much sentiment that it\nreportedly left everyone who was present with tears in their eyes.[25]\nSubsequently, Lee wanted Menzel and Bell to be in the same room when they were\nrecording the important emotional scenes of the film.[26]\n\n#### Other\nvoices[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Other voices\")]\n\nAll over the world, Elsa was dubbed in 46 languages.\n\n[Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_language \"Dutch language\") singer and actress [Willemijn\nVerkaik](/wiki/Willemijn_Verkaik \"Willemijn Verkaik\") dubbed Elsa in Dutch\n(both speaking and singing) and [German](/wiki/German_language \"German\nlanguage\") (singing only), Spanish singer [Gisela](/wiki/Gisela_\\(singer\\)\n\"Gisela \\(singer\\)\") sang both for the [Castilian\nSpanish](/wiki/Castilian_Spanish \"Castilian Spanish\") and\n[Catalan](/wiki/Catalan_language \"Catalan language\") versions and\n[French](/wiki/French_language \"French language\") singer [Anaïs\nDelva](/wiki/Ana%C3%AFs_Delva \"Anaïs Delva\")'s singing lines were also used in\nthe [Canadian French](/wiki/Canadian_French \"Canadian French\") version.\n\nBoth Anaïs Delva (French) and [Jelena Gavrilović](/wiki/Jelena_Gavrilovi%C4%87\n\"Jelena Gavrilović\") ([Serbian](/wiki/Serbian_language \"Serbian language\"))\nhad originally auditioned for Anna's role, but were eventually called back to\ndub Elsa instead.\n\nJust like Idina Menzel, four of Elsa's dubbers also played the role of\n[Elphaba](/wiki/Elphaba \"Elphaba\") in the Musical\n\"[Wicked](/wiki/Wicked_\\(musical\\) \"Wicked \\(musical\\)\")\", that is: [Maria\nLucia Rosenberg](/wiki/Maria_Lucia_Rosenberg \"Maria Lucia Rosenberg\")\n([Danish](/wiki/Danish_language \"Danish language\")), Willemijn Verkaik (Dutch\nand German), Mona Mor ([Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\")) and\n[Hyena Park](/w/index.php?title=Hyena_Park&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Hyena Park\n\\(page does not exist\\)\")\n([ko](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B0%95%ED%98%9C%EB%82%98 \"ko:박혜나\"))\n([Korean](/wiki/Korean_language \"Korean language\")).[27]\n\nSince 2013, some local TV stations have been dubbing the movie in their local\nlanguages, creating some unofficial dubs (namely:\n[Albanian](/wiki/Albanian_language \"Albanian language\"),[28] Arabic TV,\n[Karachay-Balkar](/wiki/Karachay-Balkar_language \"Karachay-Balkar\nlanguage\"),[29][30] [Persian](/wiki/Persian_language \"Persian language\")[31]\nand [Tagalog](/wiki/Tagalog_language \"Tagalog language\")[32]).\n\n[show]Elsa's dubbers worldwide[27]  \n---  \nLanguage | Dialogues | Singing  \n[Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language \"Arabic language\") | [نسمة محجوب (Nesma Mahgoub)](/wiki/Nesma_Mahgoub \"Nesma Mahgoub\")  \n[Brazilian Portuguese](/wiki/Brazilian_Portuguese \"Brazilian Portuguese\") | [Taryn Szpilman](/w/index.php?title=Taryn_Szpilman&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Taryn Szpilman \\(page does not exist\\)\") ([pt](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taryn_Szpilman \"pt:Taryn Szpilman\"))  \n[Bulgarian](/wiki/Bulgarian_language \"Bulgarian language\") | [Надежда Панайотова (Nadezhda Panayotova)](/w/index.php?title=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_\\(Nadezhda_Panayotova\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Надежда Панайотова \\(Nadezhda Panayotova\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\") ([bg](https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0 \"bg:Надежда Панайотова\"))  \n[Canadian French](/wiki/Canadian_French \"Canadian French\") | Aurélie Morgane | [Anaïs Delva](/wiki/Ana%C3%AFs_Delva \"Anaïs Delva\")  \n[Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese \"Cantonese\") | [黃紫嫻 (\"Wong Ji-Haan\";

According to Menzel, she was originally scripted as a\none-dimensional antagonist but was gradually revised as a more vulnerable,\nmultifaceted figure.[33] Menzel further described her character as \"extremely\ncomplicated and misunderstood\".[19] Director [Jennifer\nLee](/wiki/Jennifer_Lee_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Jennifer Lee \\(filmmaker\\)\") stated\nthat Elsa is largely driven by fear throughout the film,[34] while Menzel\nadded that she was also struggling with her potential to be \"a strong,\npowerful, extraordinary woman\".[15] Executive producer and animator [John\nLasseter](/wiki/John_Lasseter \"John Lasseter\") became very \"protective of\nElsa\" and was adamant about portraying her in a more favorable, sympathetic\nlight.[35] Writer and director Jennifer Lee stated on Twitter that Elsa's body\nlanguage and mannerisms were \"intentional to show anxiety and depression\".[36]\nIn July 2013, Disney released images of the film's main characters along with\noutlines of their roles in the story. Elsa received the following description:\n\n> From the outside, Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she\n> lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret—she was born with the\n> power to create ice and snow. It's a beautiful ability, but also extremely\n> dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister\n> Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to\n> suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic,\n> accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can't stop. She fears\n> she's becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help\n> her.[37]\n\nElsa's supervising animator was Wayne Unten, who asked for that role because\nhe was fascinated by her complexity.[38] Unten carefully developed Elsa's\nfacial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna's\nfearlessness.[38] For their work on designing and animating Elsa, Unten and\nthree other Disney Animation employees later won an award for _Outstanding\nAnimated Character in an Animated Feature Motion Picture_ at the [2013 Visual\nEffects Society Awards](/wiki/Visual_Effects_Society_Awards_2013 \"Visual\nEffects Society Awards 2013\"): Joy Johnson, character technical director\n([rigging](/wiki/Skeletal_animation \"Skeletal animation\")); Alexander\nAlvarado, look development artist (Disney's job title for [texture\nartists](/wiki/Texture_artist \"Texture artist\")); and Chad Stubblefield,\n[modeling](/wiki/3D_modeling \"3D modeling\") supervisor.[39] FX technical\ndirector Yoo Jae-hyun worked for a year-and-a-half on creating Elsa's ice-\nbased special effects, including effects associated with her dress.[40][41]\n\nProducers identified the scene in which Elsa sings \"Let It Go\" as a pivotal\npoint in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to \"let go\"\nof her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said,\n\"Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is\nperfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and\neverything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally\nfree—even if she is all alone.\"[19] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to\nreflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in\nrestrictive and confining outfits.[42] Menzel said that, after accepting her\nabilities, Elsa's appearance becomes \"very vampy\", continuing, \"She's quite\nsexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit!\nBut there's a gleam in her eye and a supermodel walk that goes with it and,\nfor me, it was fun to be a blonde because I'm not in real life.\"[2] In a\nJanuary 2014 interview with [John August](/wiki/John_August \"John August\") and\n[Aline Brosh McKenna](/wiki/Aline_Brosh_McKenna \"Aline Brosh McKenna\"), Lee\ndisclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical\ntransformation: \"[M]y favorite thing about it ... is the actual model for\ndoing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we\ntranslate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... [H]e got up and\nhe’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s\ndoing it. He’s acting it out.\"[43]\n\n\"We imagined what it would be like to be chased out of the kingdom. To have to\nlet go of everything you know and all the people you love. And yet the\nincredible release you'd have to finally let go of everything you've holding\nback your entire life.\"  \n---  \n—[Kristen Anderson-Lopez](/wiki/Kristen_Anderson-Lopez \"Kristen Anderson-\nLopez\") on writing Elsa's song, \"Let It Go\", and the choice to make her a\nprotagonist rather than a villain.[44]  \n  \nThe scene was also a pivotal point in the development of Elsa's character and\nwas initially planned to depict her becoming evil. Robert Lopez, who composed\nthe song with his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, explained, \"Elsa was going to\ngo from being this perfect princess that had tried to keep her personality\ndown her whole life to saying, 'Screw it. I'm gonna be me.'\"[44] They had\nwanted to use the song as a way to gain a better understanding of the\ncharacter and what she would be like if she was no longer living in fear,\nwhich ultimately resulted in her becoming much more complex.[25] The final\nlyrics and Menzel's \"ability to be so fragile and vulnerable and then break\ninto this powerhouse voice\" turned the plot around and led to Elsa being\nrevised as a \"good\" character.[44] She initially attempts to suppress her\npowers in order to avoid hurting others, particularly Anna, and when she is no\nlonger able to do so, she banishes herself from the kingdom to protect those\naround her.[19][45] Lead writer Paul Briggs said that Anna's support is what\nElsa needs most when her secret is exposed. \"The strength of the family bond\nis what makes this story so powerful,\" he explained, \"because it's her sibling\nwho's willing to look beyond her powers and stand between her and the world if\nthat's what it takes.\"[19]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/31/Early_concept_art_of_Frozen%27s_Elsa.jpg/220px-\nEarly_concept_art_of_Frozen%27s_Elsa.jpg)](/wiki/File:Early_concept_art_of_Frozen%27s_Elsa.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Early_concept_art_of_Frozen%27s_Elsa.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nEarly concept art depicting a darker version of Elsa inspired by [Amy\nWinehouse](/wiki/Amy_Winehouse \"Amy Winehouse\").\n\nElsa's appearance had to be redesigned following her transition from\nantagonist to protagonist. She was originally drawn in a style similar to\nother Disney villains, with blue skin and spiky black hair.[35] A few months\nafter the film's release, visual development artist Claire Keane (the daughter\nof [Disney Legend](/wiki/Disney_Legends \"Disney Legends\") Glen Keane)\npublished early concept art of Elsa that was modeled after the singer [Amy\nWinehouse](/wiki/Amy_Winehouse \"Amy Winehouse\").[46] At the time, she was\nimagined as having blue \"[bouffant](/wiki/Bouffant \"Bouffant\")\" hair as well\nas \"a deep, soulful voice and dramatic mood swings\".[46] Lasseter reportedly\ninfluenced the creation of the character's much softer final appearance,\nparticularly in regards to her very thick platinum blonde hair, which\nanimators found difficult to design. Art director Michael Giaimo said that\nwhile a number of strategies were proposed for Elsa's hair, Lasseter would\npush the animation team to continue making improvements, saying, \"It's not\naspirational enough. We want people to feel like this hair is a beautiful\nstatement.\"[47] During a research trip, producers found that \"there are lots\nof [braids](/wiki/Braids \"Braids\")\" worn by women in Norway; they then hired a\nstylist from New York named \"Danilo\" who helped to create a style that would\nreflect that while still being \"a little different\".[48][49][50] A new\nanimation program called Tonic was invented to assist with the task, and the\ncharacter's hair ultimately required 420,000 CGI threads.[42][51] By contrast,\nAnna was given roughly 140,000 hairs[48][52] while\n[Rapunzel](/wiki/Rapunzel_\\(Disney\\) \"Rapunzel \\(Disney\\)\") from _Tangled_ had\nonly required 27,000 CGI threads for her hair.[51]\n\n#### Abilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Abilities\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ea/Elsa%27s_ice_palace.jpg/250px-\nElsa%27s_ice_palace.jpg)](/wiki/File:Elsa%27s_ice_palace.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Elsa%27s_ice_palace.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nElsa's ice castle\n\nSince Elsa is introduced as a young child at the beginning of the film,\nanimators wanted the first glimpse of her powers to reflect her innocent and\nfanciful state of mind at the time. This included giving her first\n[snowflakes](/wiki/Snowflake \"Snowflake\") a simple design. Her snow and ice\npatterns later become more intricate and complex when she is an adult. Co-\neffects supervisor Marlon West elaborated, \"When Elsa finally lets go and\nreally starts owning her cryokinetic abilities, we wanted the ice and snow\nthat she make to get across the idea that Elsa has now grown up and become\nthis beautiful, elegant, confident and powerful young woman.\"[53]\n\nHer ice castle, which she creates while singing \"Let It Go\", was designed to\nillustrate the maturing of her powers as well as to be \"a manifestation of her\nfeelings to the world\".[53][54] The palace is initially beautiful; however,\nafter she is made aware of the destruction she has inadvertently caused, and\nas she is increasingly vilified and hunted by others, it becomes darker and\nmore distorted, with jagged icicles forming on the walls. The film's design\nteam was uncertain about how it should look and drew out designs for various\nice castles filled with snow. Lasseter suggested basing the structure and\npatterns on snowflakes. For example, an enormous snowflake would serve as the\nfoundation, and the palace would be hexagon-shaped. Lasseter also wanted\nsnowflake patterns to influence the manner in which Elsa creates the palace.\n\"Snowflakes are these tiny little ice crystals that form in mid-air. And when\nthere are changes in temperature and humidity, these snowflakes start growing\nin a pattern that's known as branching and plating,\" said co-effects\nsupervisor Dale Mayeda. \"[Lasseter] said 'You know, when Elsa builds her ice\npalace, it would be so amazing if—every step of the way as this castle forms\nout of thin air—it's just branching and plating, branching and plating all\nalong the way.\"[53]\n\nFifty animators worked on the scene in which the castle is built, and one\nframe required 30 hours to [render](/wiki/3D_rendering \"3D rendering\").[53]\nThey later extended similar techniques to Elsa's clothing. While the\ntraditional Norwegian _[rosemaling](/wiki/Rosemaling \"Rosemaling\")_ was the\ninspiration for her costuming early in the film, her ice gown was designed\nsimilarly to her palace, with snowflakes heavily influencing the style. Her\ncape itself is a large snowflake.[26]\n\n## Appearances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Appearances\")]\n\n### _Frozen_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Frozen\")]\n\nMain article: [_Frozen_ (2013 film)](/wiki/Frozen_\\(2013_film\\) \"Frozen \\(2013\nfilm\\)\")\n\nElsa, princess of Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is born with the\n[ability to create and control ice and snow](/wiki/Cryokinesis \"Cryokinesis\").\nAs a child, she uses her abilities to create a winter wonderland to play in\nwith her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa\naccidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle\nhurriedly take Anna to a tribe of [mountain trolls](/wiki/Troll \"Troll\") to be\nhealed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's\nabilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must\nlearn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident\nand of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event.\nThe king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the\ncastle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the\ntime, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in\nher emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger\nand so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile,\nher sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her\nelder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the\nsisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing\nis capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more\nlonely.\n\nThree years pass, and Elsa, now of age, is set to formally succeed her father\nas the monarch of Arendelle. Though she is afraid of opening the castle to the\nlarge crowds, her coronation goes on relatively peacefully. However, at the\nreception party, Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Prince Hans of the\nSouthern Isles, whom Anna had met earlier that day. Elsa refuses to bless\nHans's offer to marry Anna; he is someone she barely knows, prompting an\nargument between the two. Being so upset Elsa accidentally reveals her power.\nUpon the guests' and her subjects' horror and being accused of\n[sorcery](/wiki/Magic_\\(paranormal\\) \"Magic \\(paranormal\\)\") and called a\nmonster, Elsa flees the castle and retreats into the icy mountains. In the\nprocess, her emotions unleash an \"eternal\" winter throughout Arendelle. While\nthere, she decides to embrace, finally, all her powers and builds an enormous\nice palace where she believes she can live freely without fear of hurting\npeople. She also rebuilds her childhood snowman, Olaf, and unknowingly brings\nhim to life.\n\nAnna, determined to find Elsa and bring her back, travels through the\nmountains, encountering Olaf and a mountain man named Kristoff. They reach the\nice palace, where Anna attempts to persuade Elsa to return home and mend their\nrelationship. When Elsa ultimately resists (due to her memory of hurting Anna\nas a child with her powers resurfacing) Anna tells her about the state that\nArendelle and all its people was left in. Horrified, Elsa lashes out and\naccidentally freezes Anna's heart. Now even more horrified at the prospect of\nhurting her sister and people with her powers, Elsa forces Anna, Kristoff and\nOlaf out by creating a gigantic snow creature (called Marshmallow by Olaf),\nthat is a symbol of her desire to be alone so as to be able to use her powers\nwithout hurting anyone. After this, her ice castle evidently becomes darker\nand more grotesque, reflecting her torment and re-ignited fears. Meanwhile,\nAnna becomes weaker day by day and Kristoff takes her back to the trolls, who\ntell them that only an \"act of true love\" can save her life.\n\nHans and a group of soldiers attack the now ugly ice palace. Elsa seizes two\nsoldiers who attempt to assassinate her. Hans convinces her to spare them to\nprove that she is not a monster. However, she is knocked unconscious and taken\nto her castle's dungeon. Hans visits her and urges her to end the winter; Elsa\nadmits that she has no idea how to do so. After he leaves, she is able to\nbreak free from the chains by freezing them and escapes the cell, though her\nfears trigger a massive blizzard. Anna returns to the castle, believing that a\nromantic kiss from Hans will be the \"act of true love\" to save her. Instead,\nhe informs her that his offer of marriage (engagement) had been the first step\nof a plot to get him the throne of Arendelle. Olaf tells Anna that Kristoff is\nin love with her and she believes that his kiss will cure her. They rush to\nfind Kristoff. Hans confronts Elsa and tells her that she has killed Anna.\nDevastated, Elsa collapses and the blizzard stops suddenly. Hans approaches\nher and swings his sword to kill her, but Anna turns away from an approaching\nKristoff with her last bit of strength and blocks Hans' attack as she freezes\nsolid.\n\nMoments later, Anna begins to thaw, as her choice to save her sister rather\nthan herself constituted the necessary \"act of true love\".

To do so, she works heavily with Kristoff, Sven and Olaf to make\nthis a reality. Upon making sure that her surprise party in the palace\ncourtyard is ready, she leaves Kristoff in charge while she goes to get Anna.\nHowever, Elsa starts to come down with a cold as she leads Anna on a treasure\nhunt to find all the gifts that have been made for her. Without realizing it,\neach sneeze she makes creates small snowmen called \"snowgies\", which create\ntrouble for Kristoff, Sven and Olaf. As Anna notices Elsa's cold getting\nworse, she tries in vain to get Elsa to stop exerting herself, even taking\nmedicine from Oaken in case Elsa gets sicker. Unfortunately, Elsa's cold cause\nher to become very tired and behave in a seemingly intoxicated-like manner,\nand she nearly falls from Arendelle's clock tower only for Anna to save her.\nUpon finally admitting to Anna that she is indeed sick after the previous\nincident, she allows Anna to escort her home feeling she has ruined\neverything, and finds that the party has gone off successfully for Anna (as\nwell as discovering her snowgie creations), and still slightly intoxicated,\nshe ends the party by accidentally sneezing into the birthday bugle horn,\nwhich inadvertently sends a gigantic snowball all the way to the Southern\nIsles and hits the now-demoted Hans, causing him to fall into a pile of horse\nmanure. Afterwards, Anna tells a now bed-ridden Elsa that she has given her\nthe best birthday ever by letting her take care of her.\n\n### _Once Upon a\nTime_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Once Upon a Time\")]\n\nElsa  \n---  \n_[Once Upon a Time](/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_\\(TV_series\\) \"Once Upon a Time\n\\(TV series\\)\")_ character  \nFirst appearance | \"[There's No Place Like Home](/wiki/There%27s_No_Place_Like_Home_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"There's No Place Like Home \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\" (3.22)  \nLast appearance | \"[Heroes and Villains](/wiki/Heroes_and_Villains_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Heroes and Villains \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\" (4.11)  \nCreated by | \n\n  * [Edward Kitsis](/wiki/Edward_Kitsis \"Edward Kitsis\")\n  * [Adam Horowitz](/wiki/Adam_Horowitz \"Adam Horowitz\")\n\n  \nPortrayed by | [Georgina Haig](/wiki/Georgina_Haig \"Georgina Haig\")  \nInformation  \nOccupation | Queen of Arendelle  \nFamily | \n\n  * Queen Gerda and King of Arendelle (deecased parents)\n  * Anna (younger sister)\n  * Ingrid and Helga (maternal aunts)\n  * Kristoff (brother-in-law)\n\n  \nCentric episodes  \n  \n  * \"[There's No Place Like Home](/wiki/There%27s_No_Place_Like_Home_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"There's No Place Like Home \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\" (cameo)\n  * \"[A Tale of Two Sisters](/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Sisters_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"A Tale of Two Sisters \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\"\n  * \"[White Out](/wiki/White_Out_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"White Out \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\"\n  * \"[Rocky Road](/wiki/Rocky_Road_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Rocky Road \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\"\n  * \"[The Apprentice](/wiki/The_Apprentice_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"The Apprentice \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\"\n  * \"[Breaking Glass](/wiki/Breaking_Glass_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Breaking Glass \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\"\n  * \"[Family Business](/wiki/Family_Business_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Family Business \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\"\n  * \"[The Snow Queen](/wiki/The_Snow_Queen_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"The Snow Queen \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\"\n  * \"[Smash the Mirror](/wiki/Smash_the_Mirror \"Smash the Mirror\")\"\n  * \"[Fall](/wiki/Fall_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Fall \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\"\n  * \"[Shattered Sight](/wiki/Shattered_Sight \"Shattered Sight\")\"\n  * \"[Heroes and Villains](/wiki/Heroes_and_Villains_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Heroes and Villains \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\"\n\n  \n  \nElsa appears as a recurring character in the [fourth\nseason](/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_\\(season_4\\) \"Once Upon a Time \\(season 4\\)\")\nof the television series _[Once Upon a\nTime](/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_\\(TV_Series\\) \"Once Upon a Time \\(TV Series\\)\")_\n, where she is portrayed by [Georgina Haig](/wiki/Georgina_Haig \"Georgina\nHaig\").\n\nAt the end of the show's [third season](/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_\\(season_3\\)\n\"Once Upon a Time \\(season 3\\)\") finale, \"[There's No Place Like\nHome](/wiki/There%27s_No_Place_Like_Home_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"There's No\nPlace Like Home \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\", [Emma Swan](/wiki/Emma_Swan \"Emma\nSwan\") ([Snow White](/wiki/Mary_Margaret_Blanchard \"Mary Margaret Blanchard\")\nand [Prince Charming](/wiki/David_Nolan_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"David Nolan\n\\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")'s daughter) and [Captain\nHook](/wiki/Hook_\\(Once_Upon_a_Time\\) \"Hook \\(Once Upon a Time\\)\")\naccidentally bring back an urn from [Rumplestiltskin](/wiki/Mr._Gold \"Mr.\nGold\")'s vault after their excursion into the past.

In the present, Elsa is frightened by her sudden exposure\ninto the town of modern-day Storybrooke and re-conjures Marshmallow for\nprotection. Marshmallow is defeated by [Regina Mills](/wiki/Regina_Mills\n\"Regina Mills\") (the [Evil Queen](/wiki/Evil_Queen_\\(Disney\\)#Once_Upon_a_Time\n\"Evil Queen \\(Disney\\)\")), while Elsa discovers a necklace she gave long ago\nto Anna in Mr. Gold's ([Rumplestiltskin](/wiki/Rumplestiltskin\n\"Rumplestiltskin\")'s) shop, leaving her resolved to learn what happened to her\nsister.[55]\n\nAs the season progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma\nand the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group\neventually discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful\nadaptation of the original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for\nElsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon\ndiscover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from\nArendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used the power of the troll king to erase\neveryones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid\naccidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a\nprophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again.\nWith Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create\nnew sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her\nentire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated\nevents in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only\ngain their love when she was the only one left, she obtained a mirror capable\nof bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from _The Snow\nQueen_ fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they\nwould see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on\neveryone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of\nits citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune.\nIngrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa\nin the urn they originally found Elsa in.\n\nBack in Arendelle, Anna (who has woken up from the spell) tried to track down\na device known as a wishing star, which will have the power to bring her and\nKristoff to wherever Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given\nAnna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke.\nHowever, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones\nimmune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on\nher a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right\nbefore her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave\nIngrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this\nwas what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing there is\nno point in killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the\nmirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in\nStorybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town\nif you are to leave it.\n\nWith the help of Rumpelstiltskin, they are able to discover a door that will\nlead back to Arendelle, though they will not be able to return, as the door\nwill disappear after its use. Anna and Kristoff depart, while Elsa and Emma\nshare a tearful goodbye before returning to Arendelle with her little sister\nto attend the long-awaited wedding between Anna and Kristoff.

She's a\nyoung woman in difficult circumstances, frightened, trying to understand her\nabilities and burdened by expectation and convention. It's easy to sympathise\nwith her and marvel at her ability when she builds her spectacular palace in\nthe mountains.

Instead the story revolves more\naround the relationship of the two sisters and Anna who is the typical,\nfeisty, charming Disney heroine and her love trysts—instead of the alluring\nElsa.\"[108]\n\nThe character was not devoid of criticism. Charlotte O'Sullivan from the\n_[London Evening Standard](/wiki/London_Evening_Standard \"London Evening\nStandard\")_ gave a more negative assessment of Elsa, saying that she\n\"resembles one of those brittle mentors on _The X Factor_. Purple eyeshadow,\ntiny waist, kitten heels\".[109] Anna Smith of _The Guardian_ disliked that\nboth Elsa and Anna were drawn with slender figures and large eyes as is\ntypical of Disney princesses.[110] [_Slate_](/wiki/Slate_\\(magazine\\) \"Slate\n\\(magazine\\)\")'s Dana Stevens wrote that \"it's impossible not to thrill to\nElsa's surging sense of power\" but criticized the choice to illustrate her\ngrowing confidence by changing her appearance; Stevens further expressed\nconcern that the switch from the character's modest coronation gown to \"a\nslinky, slit-to-the-thigh dress with a transparent snowflake-patterned train\nand a pair of silver-white high heels\" and a hairstyle that suggested \"come-\nhither bad-girl seduction\" was overly sexual.[111] [Christy\nLemire](/wiki/Christy_Lemire \"Christy Lemire\") compared Elsa to [Carrie\nWhite](/wiki/Carrie_White \"Carrie White\"), another well-known fictional female\nwho unleashes magical powers when agitated.[112]\n\n#### \"Let It\nGo\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: \"Let It Go\"\")]\n\nMain article: [Let It Go (Disney song)](/wiki/Let_It_Go_\\(Disney_song\\) \"Let\nIt Go \\(Disney song\\)\")\n\nIdina Menzel also received praise for her singing, with Amon Warmann of _Cine\nVue_ saying her voice \"positively soars in these musical ballads\".[113]\nReviewers frequently focused on her performance of \"Let It Go\", described by\n_[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\")_ 's\nMarc Snetiker as \"an incredible anthem of liberation\" in which Elsa decides to\nno longer fear her powers.[114] Various critics said that Menzel had been a\n\"powerhouse\" during the scene;[2] Linda Barnard from _The Star_ commented that\nMenzel \"can shatter icicles with her powerful voice\".[115]\n\nMatt DeTruck of _[The Rochester City Newspaper](/wiki/City_Newspaper \"City\nNewspaper\")_ wrote, \"Menzel should be credited for providing as much power and\npassion to this performance as she did in her most famous role.\"[116] Donald\nClark of _[Irish Times](/wiki/Irish_Times \"Irish Times\")_ added, \"Elsa's\nflight to the glaciers triggers a song that, in its defiant paean to self-\nreliance, could play comfortably beside camp showtune anthems such as _I Am\nWhat I Am_ and _Don 't Rain on My Parade_. The opening and closing choruses of\nLet It Go end with a sly, spat-out refrain: 'The cold never bothered me\nanyway!' You go, girl.\"[117] Nasim Asl of _[The Oxford\nStudent](/wiki/The_Oxford_Student \"The Oxford Student\")_ continued, \"Menzel,\nespecially, steals the show with her performance of 'Let It Go'. Her _Wicked_\n-esque belting out works perfectly with such an incredible animated\nsequence—the building of the ice castle really demonstrates the prowess of\nDisney animation, and results in, arguably, one of the most spectacular power\nballads seen by any animated character, ever.\"[118]\n\n### Accolades[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Accolades\")]\n\nIn December 2013, Elsa and Anna were both nominated for Best Animated Female\nby the [Alliance of Women Film\nJournalists](/wiki/Alliance_of_Women_Film_Journalists \"Alliance of Women Film\nJournalists\"), with only Anna winning the award, a few weeks later.[119] Elsa\nwon all three awards out of three nominations at the 2013 Visual Effects\nSociety Awards, including _Outstanding Animated Character in an Animated\nFeature Motion Picture_ , _Outstanding Created Environment in an Animated\nFeature Motion Picture_ for her ice palace, and _Outstanding FX and Simulation\nAnimation in an Animated Feature Motion Picture_ for her blizzard.[39][120]\nHer signature song, \"Let It Go\", won Best Original Song at the [Academy\nAwards](/wiki/86th_Academy_Awards \"86th Academy Awards\"),[121] the Phoenix\nFilm Critics Society Awards[122] and the [Critics' Choice\nAwards](/wiki/Critics%27_Choice_Awards \"Critics' Choice Awards\"),[123] and\nalso received [Golden Globe Award](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award \"Golden Globe\nAward\"),[124] the [Satellite Awards](/wiki/Satellite_Awards \"Satellite\nAwards\"),[125] the [Broadcast Film Critics\nAssociation](/wiki/Broadcast_Film_Critics_Association \"Broadcast Film Critics\nAssociation\") Award,[126] and the [Houston Film Critics\nSociety](/wiki/Houston_Film_Critics_Society \"Houston Film Critics Society\")\nAward nominations.[127]\n\n_[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\")_ ranked Elsa as the most\ninfluential fictional character of 2014.[128]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Elsa_\\(Disney\\)&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Lee, Jennifer (September 23, 2013).
