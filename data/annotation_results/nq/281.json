K.\nRowling's](/wiki/J._K._Rowling \"J. K. Rowling\") [debut\nnovel](/wiki/Debut_novel \"Debut novel\"), first published in 1997 by\n[Bloomsbury](/wiki/Bloomsbury_Publishing \"Bloomsbury Publishing\"). It was\npublished in the United States as _**Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone**_\nby [Scholastic Corporation](/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation \"Scholastic\nCorporation\") in 1998. The plot follows [Harry\nPotter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\) \"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\"), a\nyoung [wizard](/wiki/Wizard_\\(fantasy\\) \"Wizard \\(fantasy\\)\") who discovers\nhis magical heritage as he makes close friends and a few enemies in his first\nyear at the [Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\nWizardry](/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry \"Hogwarts School of\nWitchcraft and Wizardry\"). With the help of his friends, Harry faces an\nattempted comeback by the dark wizard [Lord Voldemort](/wiki/Lord_Voldemort\n\"Lord Voldemort\"), who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when\nhe was just 15 months old.\n\nThe novel won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and\nother awards in the US. The book reached the top of the _New York Times_ list\nof best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list\nfor much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least seventy three\nother languages and has been made into a [feature-length\nfilm](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_\\(film\\) \"Harry Potter\nand the Philosopher's Stone \\(film\\)\") of the same name, as have all six of\nits sequels.\n\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination,\nhumour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few\ncomplained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been\ncompared to that of [Jane Austen](/wiki/Jane_Austen \"Jane Austen\"), one of\nRowling's favourite authors, [Roald Dahl](/wiki/Roald_Dahl \"Roald Dahl\"),\nwhose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry\nPotter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller [Homer](/wiki/Homer \"Homer\"). While\nsome commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian\n[boarding school](/wiki/Boarding_school \"Boarding school\") stories, others\nthought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring\ncontemporary ethical and social issues.\n\n_Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone_, along with the rest of the _Harry\nPotter_ series, has been attacked by several religious groups and banned in\nsome countries because of accusations that the novels promote\n[witchcraft](/wiki/Witchcraft \"Witchcraft\"), but other religious commentators\nhave written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints, including the\npower of self-sacrifice and the ways in which people's decisions shape their\npersonalities. The series has been used as a source of [object\nlessons](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/object_lesson \"wikt:object lesson\") in\n[educational techniques](/wiki/Education#Teaching \"Education\"), [sociological\nanalysis](/wiki/Sociology \"Sociology\") and marketing.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Synopsis\n    * 1.1 Plot\n    * 1.2 Main characters\n  * 2 Development, publication and reception\n    * 2.1 Development\n    * 2.2 Publication and reception in the United Kingdom\n    * 2.3 U.S. publication and reception\n    * 2.4 Translations\n  * 3 Style and themes\n  * 4 Legacy\n    * 4.1 Sequels\n    * 4.2 Illustrated Version\n    * 4.3 Film version\n    * 4.4 Video games\n    * 4.5 Uses in education and business\n  * 5 Release history\n  * 6 Footnotes\n    * 6.1 Notes\n    * 6.2 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n##\nSynopsis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Synopsis\")]\n\n###\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Michael_Maier_Atalanta_Fugiens_Emblem_21.jpeg/220px-\nMichael_Maier_Atalanta_Fugiens_Emblem_21.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Michael_Maier_Atalanta_Fugiens_Emblem_21.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Michael_Maier_Atalanta_Fugiens_Emblem_21.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAs the main title suggests, the plot centres on a [legendary alchemical\nsubstance](/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone \"Philosopher's stone\") which is\nbelieved by some to give immortality\n\nThe most evil and powerful dark wizard in history, [Lord\nVoldemort](/wiki/Lord_Voldemort \"Lord Voldemort\"), murders\n[James](/wiki/James_Potter_\\(character\\) \"James Potter \\(character\\)\") and\n[Lily Potter](/wiki/Lily_Potter \"Lily Potter\") but mysteriously disappears\nafter failing to kill their infant son, Harry. While the [wizarding\nworld](/wiki/Wizarding_world \"Wizarding world\") celebrates Voldemort's\napparent downfall, [Professor Dumbledore](/wiki/Professor_Dumbledore\n\"Professor Dumbledore\"), [Professor McGonagall](/wiki/Professor_McGonagall\n\"Professor McGonagall\") and half-giant [Rubeus Hagrid](/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid\n\"Rubeus Hagrid\") place the one-year-old orphan in the care of his surly and\ncold [Muggle](/wiki/Muggle \"Muggle\") uncle and aunt, [Vernon and Petunia\nDursley](/wiki/Dursley_family \"Dursley family\") and their spoilt and bullying\nson, Dudley.\n\nFor ten years, living at number Four Privet Drive, Harry is treated by the\nDursleys more like a servant than a member of the family and is forced to live\nin a cupboard under the stairs. Shortly before his eleventh birthday, a series\nof letters addressed to Harry arrive, but Uncle Vernon destroys them before\nHarry can read them, leading to an influx of more and more letters. To evade\nthe pursuit of these letters, Vernon first takes the family to a hotel, but\nwhen the letters arrive there too, he hires a boat out to a hut on a small\nisland.\n\nIt is Harry's eleventh birthday and at midnight, Hagrid bursts through the\ndoor to deliver the letter and to tell Harry what the Dursleys have kept from\nhim: Harry is a wizard and has been accepted into [Hogwarts School of\nWitchcraft and Wizardry](/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry\n\"Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\"), where Hagrid is groundskeeper\nand Dumbledore is Headmaster. Hagrid takes Harry to a hidden London street\ncalled [Diagon Alley](/wiki/Diagon_Alley \"Diagon Alley\"), where he is\nsurprised to discover how famous he is among the witches and wizards, who\nrefer to him as \"the boy who lived.\" He also finds that his parents'\ninheritance is waiting for him at [Gringotts Wizarding\nBank](/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank \"Gringotts Wizarding Bank\"). Guided by\nHagrid, he buys the equipment he will need for his first year at Hogwarts and\nas a birthday gift Harry receives a pet owl from Hagrid (which he names\n\"Hedwig\").\n\nA month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the [Hogwarts\nExpress](/wiki/Hogwarts_Express \"Hogwarts Express\") from [King's Cross railway\nstation](/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station \"London King's Cross\nrailway station\"). There he meets the [Weasley family](/wiki/Weasley_family\n\"Weasley family\"), who show him how to pass through the magic wall to\n[Platform 9¾](/wiki/Platform_9%C2%BE \"Platform 9¾\"), where the train that will\ntake them to Hogwarts is waiting. While on the train, Harry meets two fellow\nfirst years, [Ron Weasley](/wiki/Ron_Weasley \"Ron Weasley\"), who immediately\nbecomes his friend, and [Hermione Granger](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione\nGranger\"), with whom the ice is a bit slower to break. Harry also makes an\nenemy of yet another first-year, [Draco Malfoy](/wiki/Draco_Malfoy \"Draco\nMalfoy\"). Draco offers to advise Harry, but Harry dislikes Draco for his\narrogance and prejudice and rejects his offer of \"friendship\".\n\nAt Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical [Sorting\nHat](/wiki/Sorting_Hat \"Sorting Hat\") to [houses](/wiki/House_system \"House\nsystem\") that best suit their personalities. While Harry is being sorted, the\nHat suggests that he be placed into [Slytherin](/wiki/Slytherin \"Slytherin\")\nwhich is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, but when Harry\nobjects, the Hat sends him to [Gryffindor](/wiki/Gryffindor \"Gryffindor\"). Ron\nand Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor. Draco is sorted into Slytherin,\nlike his whole family before him.\n\nHarry starts classes at Hogwarts School, with lessons including\nTransfiguration with head of Gryffindor, Minerva McGonagall, Herbology with\nHead of Hufflepuff, Pomona Sprout, Charms with Head of Ravenclaw Filius\nFlitwick, and Defence Against the Dark Arts with Quirinus Quirrell. Harry's\nleast favourite class is Potions, taught by [Severus\nSnape](/wiki/Severus_Snape \"Severus Snape\"), the vindictive Head of Slytherin\nwho seems to loathe Harry. Harry, Ron, and Hermione become far more interested\nby extracurricular matters within and outside the school, particularly after\nthey discover that a huge three-headed dog is standing guard over a trap door\nin a forbidden corridor. They also become suspicious of Snape's behaviour and\nbecome convinced that he is looking for ways to get past the trapdoor to\nwhatever it's hiding.\n\nHarry discovers an innate talent for flying on broomsticks and is appointed as\nSeeker on his House’s Quidditch team, a wizards' sport played in the air. His\nfirst game goes well until his broomstick wobbles in mid-air and almost throws\nhim off. Ron and Hermione suspect foul play from Snape, whom they saw behaving\noddly. For Christmas, Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous\nsource and begins exploring the school at night and investigating the hidden\nobject further. He discovers the Mirror of Erised (backwards for \"desire\"), in\nwhich the viewer sees his or her deepest desires becoming true.\n\nThanks to an indiscretion from Hagrid, Harry and his friends work out that the\nobject kept at the school is a [Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Philosopher's Stone\"), made by an old\nfriend of Dumbledore named [Nicolas Flamel](/wiki/Nicolas_Flamel \"Nicolas\nFlamel\"), which grants its user immortality, as long as it's constantly used.\nHarry is also informed by a centaur he meets in the forest that a plot to\nsteal the Philosopher’s Stone is being orchestrated by none other than\nVoldemort himself, who would use it to be restored to his body and come back\nto power. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry\nand his friends fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the\ntrapdoor themselves.\n\nThey encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills\npossessed by one of the three, and one of which requires Ron to sacrifice\nhimself in a life-sized game of wizard's chess. In the final room, Harry, now\nalone, finds Quirrell, who admits that he had tried to kill Harry at his\nQuidditch match against Slytherin. He also admits that he let a troll into\nHogwarts. Snape had been trying to protect Harry all along rather than to kill\nhim, and his suspicious behaviour came from his own suspicions about Quirrell.\n\nQuirrell is one of Voldemort's followers, and is now partly\n[possessed](/wiki/Spirit_possession \"Spirit possession\") by him: Voldemort's\nface has sprouted on the back of his own head, hidden by his turban. Voldemort\nneeds Harry's help to get past the final obstacle: the Mirror of Erised. When\nstood in front of it, the Mirror recognises Harry's lack of greed for the\nStone and surreptitiously deposits it in his pocket. Quirrell promptly tries\nto seize the Stone, but his flesh burns on contact with Harry, proving lethal\nfor Quirrell. Harry passes out and awakens in the school hospital, where\nDumbledore explains to him that he survived because his mother sacrificed her\nlife to protect him, and this left a powerful protective charm on him. It is\nalso revealed that the invisibility cloak was left by his father for\nDumbledore to keep and give to Harry. Voldemort left Quirrell to die and is\nlikely to return by some other means. The Stone has now been destroyed. The\nschool year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House\nCup. Harry returns to the Dursleys' for the summer holiday but does not tell\nthem that under-age wizards are forbidden to use magic outside of Hogwarts.\n\n### Main\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Main characters\")]\n\n  * [Harry Potter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\) \"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\") is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a \"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\"[2] She developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from there.[3] Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead,[3] which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry has a natural talent for [Quidditch](/wiki/Quidditch \"Quidditch\") and became the first person in decades to get on their team in their first year.\n  * [Ronald Weasley](/wiki/Ron_Weasley \"Ron Weasley\") is Harry's age and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best friend, \"always there when you need him.\"[4] He is freckled, red-haired and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.\n  * [Hermione Granger](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione Granger\"), the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character[5] with \"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[5] Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll, and her magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.\n  * [Neville Longbottom](/wiki/Neville_Longbottom \"Neville Longbottom\") is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful that his grandmother gives him a [Remembrall](/wiki/Remembrall \"Remembrall\"), although he cannot remember why. Neville's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save his life when he was eight. Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important.\n  * [Rubeus Hagrid](/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid \"Rubeus Hagrid\"), a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black hair and beard, was expelled from [Hogwarts](/wiki/Hogwarts \"Hogwarts\") and his [wand](/wiki/Magic_wand \"Magic wand\") was snapped in half (resulting in him never to use a wand again), however [Professor Dumbledore](/wiki/Professor_Dumbledore \"Professor Dumbledore\") let him stay on as the school's [gamekeeper](/wiki/Gamekeeper \"Gamekeeper\"), a job which enables him to lavish affection and [pet names](/wiki/Pet_name \"Pet name\") on even the most dangerous of magical creatures. Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry, Ron and, later, Hermione, but his carelessness makes him unreliable.\n  * [Professor Albus Dumbledore](/wiki/Professor_Dumbledore \"Professor Dumbledore\"), a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt, is the headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears. Dumbledore, while renowned for his achievements in magic, he shrugs off praise, he is aware of his own brilliance. Rowling described him as the \"epitome of goodness\".[6]\n  * [Professor Minerva McGonagall](/wiki/Professor_McGonagall \"Professor McGonagall\"), a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight [bun](/wiki/Bun_\\(hairstyle\\) \"Bun \\(hairstyle\\)\"), teaches [Transfiguration](/wiki/Transfiguration_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Transfiguration \\(Harry Potter\\)\"), and sometimes transforms herself into a cat. She is Deputy Headmistress, and Head of Gryffindor House and, according to the author, \"under that gruff exterior\" is \"a bit of an old softy\".[7]\n  * [Petunia Dursley](/wiki/Petunia_Dursley \"Petunia Dursley\"), the sister of Harry's mother [Lily](/wiki/Lily_Potter \"Lily Potter\"), is a thin woman with a long neck that she uses for spying on the neighbours. She regards her magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that she never existed.\n  * [Vernon Dursley](/wiki/Vernon_Dursley \"Vernon Dursley\") is the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual.\n  * [Dudley Dursley](/wiki/Dudley_Dursley \"Dudley Dursley\") is an overweight, spoiled bully, and cousin of Harry Potter (who uses Harry as his punching bag).\n  * [Draco Malfoy](/wiki/Draco_Malfoy \"Draco Malfoy\") is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored [drawl](/wiki/Drawl \"Drawl\"). He is arrogant about his skill in [Quidditch](/wiki/Quidditch \"Quidditch\"), and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard – and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been [bewitched](/wiki/Imperius_Curse \"Imperius Curse\"). Draco avoids direct confrontations, and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.\n  * [Oliver Wood](/wiki/Oliver_Wood_\\(Harry_Potter\\) \"Oliver Wood \\(Harry Potter\\)\") is Harry's Quidditch captain for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He plays as keeper.\n  * [Professor Quirrell](/wiki/Professor_Quirrell \"Professor Quirrell\") is a twitching, stammering man who teaches [Defence Against the Dark Arts](/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts \"Defence Against the Dark Arts\"). Reputedly he was a brilliant scholar, but his nerve was shattered by an encounter with [vampires](/wiki/Vampire \"Vampire\"). Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that he is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Quirrell's head.\n  * [Professor Severus Snape](/wiki/Severus_Snape \"Severus Snape\"), who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion and greasy black hair, teaches [Potions](/wiki/Potions_Class \"Potions Class\"), but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape praises pupils in Slytherin, his own House but seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is a follower of Voldemort.\n  * [Argus Filch](/wiki/Argus_Filch \"Argus Filch\"), the school caretaker who knows the school's [secret passages](/wiki/Hogwarts#Passages \"Hogwarts\") better than anyone else except, possibly, the Weasley twins. His cat, Mrs. Norris, aids his constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.\n\nOther members of staff include the dumpy\n[Herbology](/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Herbology \"Magic in Harry Potter\")\nteacher and Head of Hufflepuff House [Professor Sprout](/wiki/Professor_Sprout\n\"Professor Sprout\"), [Professor Flitwick](/wiki/Professor_Flitwick \"Professor\nFlitwick\"), the tiny and excitable [Charms](/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Charms\n\"Magic in Harry Potter\") teacher, and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific\n[History of Magic](/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#History_of_Magic \"Magic in\nHarry Potter\") teacher, [Professor Binns](/wiki/Professor_Binns \"Professor\nBinns\"), a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death; and [Madam\nHooch](/wiki/Madam_Hooch \"Madam Hooch\"), the Quidditch coach, who is strict,\nbut a considerate and methodical teacher. The [poltergeist](/wiki/Poltergeist\n\"Poltergeist\") [Peeves](/wiki/Peeves \"Peeves\") wanders around the castle\ncausing trouble wherever he can.\n\nIn the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first\ncharacter to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the\nactions centre on the eponymous hero [Harry\nPotter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\) \"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\"), an\norphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the [Dursley\nfamily](/wiki/Dursley_family \"Dursley family\"). Rowling imagined him as a\n\"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard\",[2]\nand says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him.[8]\nDuring the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione\nGranger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, \"always\nthere when you need him\".[4] Rowling has described Hermione as a \"very\nlogical, upright and good\" character[5] with \"a lot of insecurity and a great\nfear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[5]\n\nRowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts\nis the powerful, but kind wizard [Albus Dumbledore](/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore\n\"Albus Dumbledore\"), who becomes Harry's confidant; Rowling described him as\n\"epitome of goodness\".[6] His right hand is severe [Minerva\nMcGonagall](/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall \"Minerva McGonagall\"), who according to\nthe author \"under that gruff exterior\" is \"a bit of an old softy\",[7] the\nfriendly half-giant [Rubeus Hagrid](/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid \"Rubeus Hagrid\"), who\nsaved Harry from the Dursley family, and the sinister Severus Snape.[9]\nProfessor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.\n\nThe main antagonists are [Draco Malfoy](/wiki/Draco_Malfoy \"Draco Malfoy\"), an\nelitist, bullying classmate[10] and [Lord Voldemort](/wiki/Lord_Voldemort\n\"Lord Voldemort\"), the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when\nhe tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the\ncharacter of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry, and his\n[backstory](/wiki/Backstory \"Backstory\") was intentionally not fleshed-out at\nfirst:\n\n> The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly.\n> And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. [...] And so then I kind of\n> worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he\n> wouldn't know what he was. [...] When he was one year old, the most evil\n> wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed\n> Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him.\n> [...] And—so—but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry.\n> So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the\n> curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.[3]\n\n## Development, publication and\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Development, publication and reception\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nThe book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately\nJune 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990 Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be\nknown,[a] wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in\n[Manchester](/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\") and in her words, \"One weekend\nafter flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for\nHarry Potter fell into my head...

Barry\nCunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new\nauthors for [Bloomsbury Children's Books](/wiki/Bloomsbury_Publishing\n\"Bloomsbury Publishing\"), recommended accepting the book,[15] and the eight-\nyear-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was \"so much better\nthan anything else\".[16]\n\n### Publication and reception in the United\nKingdom[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Publication and reception in the United Kingdom\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Harry_Potter_Platform_Kings_Cross.jpg/220px-\nHarry_Potter_Platform_Kings_Cross.jpg)](/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_Platform_Kings_Cross.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_Platform_Kings_Cross.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nImitation of the fictional [Platform 9¾](/wiki/Platform_9%C2%BE \"Platform 9¾\")\nat the real [King's Cross railway\nstation](/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station \"London King's Cross\nrailway station\"), with a luggage trolley apparently halfway through the\nmagical wall\n\nBloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500\n[advance](/wiki/Advance_payment \"Advance payment\"),[17] and Cunningham sent\n[proof copies](/wiki/Galley_proof \"Galley proof\") to carefully chosen authors,\ncritics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when\nthe book was launched.[15] He was less concerned about the book's length than\nabout its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to him, and\nhe believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted\nthe _[nom de plume](/wiki/Nom_de_plume \"Nom de plume\")_ [J.K.\nRowling](/wiki/J.K._Rowling \"J.K. Rowling\") just before publication.[15] In\nJune 1997, Bloomsbury published _Philosopher 's Stone_ with an initial print-\nrun of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to\nlibraries.[18] Her original name, \"Joanne Rowling\", can be found in small\nprint on the copyright page of this first British edition. (The 1998 first\nAmerican edition would remove reference to \"Joanne\" completely.)[19] The short\ninitial print run was standard for first novels, and Cunningham hoped\nbooksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.[15] Examples\nfrom this initial print run have sold for as much as US$33,460 in a 2007\n[Heritage](/wiki/Heritage_Auctions \"Heritage Auctions\") Auction.[20]\n\nLindsey Fraser, who had supplied one of the [blurb](/wiki/Blurb \"Blurb\")\ncomments,[15] wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in _[The\nScotsman](/wiki/The_Scotsman \"The Scotsman\")_ on 28 June 1997. She described\n_Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone_ as \"a hugely entertaining\nthriller\" and Rowling as \"a first-rate writer for children\".[15][21] Another\nearly review, in _[The Herald](/wiki/The_Herald_\\(Glasgow\\) \"The Herald\n\\(Glasgow\\)\")_ , said, \"I have yet to find a child who can put it down.\"\nNewspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews\nin _[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_ , _[The Sunday\nTimes](/wiki/The_Sunday_Times \"The Sunday Times\")_ and _[The Mail on\nSunday](/wiki/The_Mail_on_Sunday \"The Mail on Sunday\")_ , and in September\n1997 _[Books for Keeps](/wiki/Books_for_Keeps \"Books for Keeps\")_ , a magazine\nthat specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of\nfive.[15] _[The Mail on Sunday](/wiki/The_Mail_on_Sunday \"The Mail on\nSunday\")_ rated it as \"the most imaginative debut since [Roald\nDahl](/wiki/Roald_Dahl \"Roald Dahl\")\"; a view echoed by the _[Sunday\nTimes](/wiki/Sunday_Times \"Sunday Times\")_ (\"comparisons to Dahl are, this\ntime, justified\"), while _[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_\ncalled it \"a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit\" and\n_[The Scotsman](/wiki/The_Scotsman \"The Scotsman\")_ said it had \"all the\nmakings of a classic\".[15]\n\nIn 1997 the UK edition won a [National Book\nAward](/wiki/Specsavers_National_Book_Awards \"Specsavers National Book\nAwards\") and a gold medal in the 9 to 11 year-olds category of the [Nestlé\nSmarties Book Prize](/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_Smarties_Book_Prize \"Nestlé Smarties\nBook Prize\").[22] The _Smarties_ award, which is voted for by children, made\nthe book well-known within six months of publication, while most children's\nbooks have to wait for years.[15] The following year, _Philosopher 's Stone_\nwon almost all the other major British awards that were decided by\nchildren.[15][b] It was also shortlisted for children's books awards\nadjudicated by adults,[23] but did not win. Sandra Beckett comments that books\nwhich were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of\nthe highest literary standards – for example the literary establishment\ndisdained the works of [Roald Dahl](/wiki/Roald_Dahl \"Roald Dahl\"), an\noverwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's\nbooks.[24] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the [BBC](/wiki/BBC\n\"BBC\")'s survey [The Big Read](/wiki/The_Big_Read \"The Big Read\").[25]\n\n_Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone_ won two publishing industry awards\ngiven for sales rather than literary merit, the [British Book\nAwards](/wiki/British_Book_Awards \"British Book Awards\") Children's Book of\nthe Year and the Booksellers' Association / _Bookseller_ Author of the\nYear.[15] By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies,[26] and\nthe story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001.[27] A\n[Braille](/wiki/Braille \"Braille\") edition was published in May 1998 by the\nScottish Braille Press.[28]\n\n[Platform 9¾](/wiki/Platform_9%C2%BE \"Platform 9¾\"), from which the Hogwarts\nExpress left London, was commemorated in the real-life [King's Cross railway\nstation](/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station \"London King's Cross\nrailway station\") with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the\nwall.[29]\n\n### U.S. publication and\nreception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: U.S. publication and reception\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer%27s_Stone.jpg/150px-\nHarry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer%27s_Stone.jpg)](/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer%27s_Stone.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer%27s_Stone.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOriginal U.S. cover of _Sorcerer 's Stone_\n\nUK to American translation examples[30][31] UK | American  \n---|---  \nmum, mam | mom  \n[sherbet lemon](/wiki/Sherbet_lemon \"Sherbet lemon\") | [lemon drop](/wiki/Lemon_drop_\\(candy\\) \"Lemon drop \\(candy\\)\")  \nmotorbike | motorcycle  \n[chips](/wiki/French_fries \"French fries\") | fries  \ncrisp | chip  \njelly | [Jell-O](/wiki/Jell-O \"Jell-O\")  \njacket potato | baked potato  \njumper | sweater  \n  \n[Scholastic Corporation](/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation \"Scholastic\nCorporation\") bought the U.S. rights at the [Bologna Book\nFair](/wiki/Bologna_Children%27s_Book_Fair \"Bologna Children's Book Fair\") in\nApril 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book.[15]\nThey thought that a child would not want to read a book with the word\n\"philosopher\" in the title and,[32][_[not in citation\ngiven](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_] after some\ndiscussion, the American edition was published in September 1998[33] under the\ntitle Rowling suggested, _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone_.[15] Rowling\nclaimed that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had\nbeen in a stronger position at the time.[11] [Philip Nel](/wiki/Philip_Nel\n\"Philip Nel\") has pointed out that the change lost the connection with\n[alchemy](/wiki/Alchemy \"Alchemy\"), and the meaning of some other terms\nchanged in translation, for example from \"[crumpet](/wiki/Crumpet \"Crumpet\")\"\nto \"[muffin](/wiki/Muffin \"Muffin\")\". While Rowling accepted the change from\nboth the British English \"mum\" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant \"mam\" to\n\"mom\" in _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone_, she vetoed this change in\nthe later books, which was then reversed in later editions of _Philosopher 's\nStone_. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were\nconsiderably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English\nbooks of the time, and that some other changes could be regarded as useful\n[copyedits](/wiki/Copyedit \"Copyedit\").[30] Since the British editions of\nearly titles in the series were published a few months earlier than the\nAmerican versions, some American readers became familiar with the British\nEnglish versions after buying them via the Internet.[34]\n\nAt first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book\ntrade and library publications such as _[Kirkus Reviews](/wiki/Kirkus_Reviews\n\"Kirkus Reviews\")_ and _[Booklist](/wiki/Booklist \"Booklist\")_ , which\nexamined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction.\nHowever, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by _Cooperative\nChildren 's Book Center Choices_, which pointed out the complexity, depth and\nconsistency of the world Rowling had [built](/wiki/World-building \"World-\nbuilding\")) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers.[35]\nAlthough _[The Boston Globe](/wiki/The_Boston_Globe \"The Boston Globe\")_ and\nMichael Winerip in _The New York Times_ complained that the final chapters\nwere the weakest part of the book,[21][36] they and most other American\nreviewers gave glowing praise.[15][21] A year later the US edition was\nselected as an [American Library Association Notable\nBook](/wiki/American_Library_Association_Notable_Book \"American Library\nAssociation Notable Book\"), a _[Publishers Weekly](/wiki/Publishers_Weekly\n\"Publishers Weekly\")_ Best Book of 1998, and a [New York Public\nLibrary](/wiki/New_York_Public_Library \"New York Public Library\") 1998 Best\nBook of the Year, and won _[Parenting Magazine](/wiki/Parenting_Magazine\n\"Parenting Magazine\")'_s Book of the Year Award for 1998,[22] the School\nLibrary Journal Best Book of the Year, and the American Library Association\nBest Book for Young Adults.[15]\n\nIn August 1999, _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone_ topped the _New York\nTimes_ list of best-selling fiction,[37] and stayed near the top of the list\nfor much of 1999 and 2000, until the _New York Times_ split its list into\nchildren's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were\neager to see their books given higher placings.[24][35] _[Publishers\nWeekly](/wiki/Publishers_Weekly \"Publishers Weekly\")'_s report in December\n2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed _Harry Potter and the\nSorcerer 's Stone_ 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among\npaperbacks (over 6.6 million copies).[38]\n\nIn May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition\nof the book[39] that was released on 1 October 2008[40] to mark the tenth\nanniversary of the original American release.[39] For the fifteenth\nanniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released _Sorcerer 's Stone_, along\nwith the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by [Kazu\nKibuishi](/wiki/Kazu_Kibuishi \"Kazu Kibuishi\") in 2013.[41][42][43]\n\n###\nTranslations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Translations\")]\n\nMain article: [Harry Potter in translation](/wiki/Harry_Potter_in_translation\n\"Harry Potter in translation\")\n\nBy mid-2008, official translations of the book had been published in 67\nlanguages.[44]By September 11, 2017, official translations of the book had\nbeen published in 74 languages.[45] Bloomsbury have published translations in\n[Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") and in [Ancient Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek\n\"Ancient Greek\"),[46][47] and the latter was described as \"one of the most\nimportant pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries\".[48]\n\n## Style and\nthemes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Style and themes\")]\n\nSee also: [Harry Potter influences and\nanalogues](/wiki/Harry_Potter_influences_and_analogues \"Harry Potter\ninfluences and analogues\")\n\n[Philip Nel](/wiki/Philip_Nel \"Philip Nel\") highlighted the influence of [Jane\nAusten](/wiki/Jane_Austen \"Jane Austen\"), whom Rowling has greatly admired\nsince the age of twelve. Both novelists encourage re-reading, because details\nthat look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later\nin the story-line – for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the\nbeginning of _Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone_, and then becomes a\nmajor character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry\noften has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social\nbehaviour in the _Harry Potter_ books is remininiscent of Austen, for example\nthe excited communal reading of letters. Both authors [satirise](/wiki/Satire\n\"Satire\") social behaviour and give characters names that express their\npersonalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on\n[caricature](/wiki/Caricature \"Caricature\") and the names she invents are more\nlike those found in [Charles Dickens's](/wiki/Charles_Dickens \"Charles\nDickens\") stories,[21]:13–15 and [Amanda Cockrell](/wiki/Amanda_Cockrell\n\"Amanda Cockrell\") noted that many of these express their owners' traits\nthrough [allusions](/wiki/Allusion \"Allusion\") that run from ancient Roman\nmythology to eighteenth-century German literature.[49] Rowling, like the\n[Narnia](/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia \"The Chronicles of Narnia\") series'\nauthor [C.S. Lewis](/wiki/C.S._Lewis \"C.S. Lewis\"), thinks there is no rigid\ndistinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that,\nlike many good writers for children, Rowling combines [literary\ngenres](/wiki/Literary_genre \"Literary genre\")‍—‌[fantasy](/wiki/Fantasy\n\"Fantasy\"), [young adult fiction](/wiki/Young_adult_fiction \"Young adult\nfiction\"), boarding school stories, _[Bildungsroman](/wiki/Bildungsroman\n\"Bildungsroman\")_ and many others.[21]:51–52\n\nSome reviewers compared _Philosopher 's Stone_ to the stories of [Roald\nDahl](/wiki/Roald_Dahl \"Roald Dahl\"), who died in 1990. Many writers since the\n1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near\nhis popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch\nof _Philosopher 's Stone_, seven of the ten most popular children's books were\nby Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular\nchildren's author of the late 1990s was an American, [R. L.\nStine](/wiki/R._L._Stine \"R. L. Stine\"). Some of the story elements in\n_Philosopher 's Stone_ resembled parts of Dahl's stories; for example, the\nhero of _[James and the Giant Peach](/wiki/James_and_the_Giant_Peach \"James\nand the Giant Peach\")_ lost his parents and had to live with a pair of\nunpleasant aunts‍—‌one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who\ntreated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation,\nable to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child\ninside.[15]\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the\nliveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as\n[Diagon Alley](/wiki/Diagon_Alley \"Diagon Alley\").[22][50] Tad Brennan\ncommented that Rowling's writing resembles that of [Homer](/wiki/Homer\n\"Homer\"): \"rapid, plain, and direct in expression.\"[48] [Stephen\nKing](/wiki/Stephen_King \"Stephen King\") admired \"the sort of playful details\nof which only British fantasists seem capable\" and concluded that they worked\nbecause Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.[51]\n\n[Nicholas Tucker](/wiki/Nicholas_Tucker \"Nicholas Tucker\") described the early\n_Harry Potter_ books as looking back to [Victorian](/wiki/Victorian_literature\n\"Victorian literature\") and [Edwardian](/wiki/Edwardian \"Edwardian\")\nchildren's stories: [Hogwarts](/wiki/Hogwarts \"Hogwarts\") was an old-style\n[boarding school](/wiki/Boarding_school \"Boarding school\") in which the\nteachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned\nwith the reputations of the houses with which they were associated;\ncharacters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting\nwith the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than\nreformed, including [Filch's](/wiki/Filch \"Filch\") cat Mrs Norris; and the\nhero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic\nand good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.[52]\nSeveral other commentators have stated that the books present a highly\n[stratified](/wiki/Social_stratification \"Social stratification\") society\nincluding many [social stereotypes](/wiki/Social_stereotype \"Social\nstereotype\").[53] However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a\nclass system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and\nstatus it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the\nracial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school\nbullying.[54]\n\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no [rule of law](/wiki/Rule_of_law \"Rule of\nlaw\") in the books, as the actions of [Ministry of\nMagic](/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic \"Ministry of Magic\") officials are\nunconstrained by laws, [accountability](/wiki/Accountability \"Accountability\")\nor any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for\n[Voldemort](/wiki/Voldemort \"Voldemort\") to offer his own horrific version of\norder. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly\nregulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to\nwizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the\nPhilosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that\nmost wizards have no chance of solving it.[55]\n\nNel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely\nconventional, [status](/wiki/Social_status \"Social status\")-conscious,\nmaterialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the\nBritish government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual\ncouple as the \"preferred norm\", while the author was a [single\nmother](/wiki/Single_parent \"Single parent\"). Harry's relationships with adult\nand juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in\nhis happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family\nthroughout the series, and in his treatment of first [Rubeus\nHagrid](/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid \"Rubeus Hagrid\") and later [Remus\nLupin](/wiki/Remus_Lupin \"Remus Lupin\") and [Sirius Black](/wiki/Sirius_Black\n\"Sirius Black\") as father-figures.[21]:13–15,

inequality](/wiki/Social_inequality \"Social\ninequality\"); [social institutions](/wiki/Social_institutions \"Social\ninstitutions\"); and [social theory](/wiki/Social_theory \"Social theory\")\".[53]\n\nStephen Brown noted that the early _Harry Potter_ books, especially _Harry\nPotter and the Philosopher 's Stone_, were a runaway success despite\ninadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives\nto be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the \"analysis,\nplanning, implementation, and control\" model of management. Instead he\nrecommended that they should treat the stories as \"a marketing masterclass\",\nfull of enticing products and brand names.[50] For example, a real-world\nanalogue of [Bertie Bott's Every Flavour\nBeans](/wiki/Bertie_Bott%27s_Every_Flavour_Beans \"Bertie Bott's Every Flavour\nBeans\") was introduced [under\nlicence](/wiki/Licence#Trademark_and_brand_licensing \"Licence\") in 2000 by\ntoymaker [Hasbro](/wiki/Hasbro \"Hasbro\").[50][90]\n\n## Release\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Release history\")]\n\nCountry | Release date | Edition  \n(Hardback/Paperback) | Publisher | Pages  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCanada | 1 December 1998[91][92] | Hardback Children's Edition | [Raincoast](/wiki/Raincoast_Books \"Raincoast Books\") | 223  \nPaperback Adult Edition (Original)  \n1 November 1999[93] | Hardback Signature Special Edition  \n31 August 2000[94] | Paperback Children's Edition  \n16 October 2002[95] | Paperback Magic Edition  \n4 October 2004[96] | Hardback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 336  \n12 January 2011[97][98] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | [Bloomsbury](/wiki/Bloomsbury_Publishing \"Bloomsbury Publishing\") | 223  \nPaperback Harry Potter Signature Edition  \n27 August 2013[99] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover)  \nUnited Kingdom | 26 June 1997[100][101] | Hardback Children's Edition  \nPaperback Children's Edition  \n11 September 1998[102] | Paperback Adult Edition (Original)  \n27 September 1999[103] | Hardback Signature Special Edition  \n8 October 2001[104] | Paperback Special Edition  \n10 July 2004[105] | Hardback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 336  \n4 October 2004[106] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 223  \n1 November 2010[107] | Paperback Harry Potter Signature Edition  \n18 July 2013[108] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover)  \n6 October 2015[109] | Hardcover Illustrated Edition (Illustrated by Jim Kay) | 256  \nUnited States | 1 September 1998[110] | Hardback | [Arthur A.

He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry ... but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry.
