He built a hobby class car with his friends, and\ntook turns behind the wheel. Gant became the full-time driver and won the\ntrack championship.[2] [Hickory Speedway](/wiki/Hickory_Speedway \"Hickory\nSpeedway\") was paved in 1967 after [Ned Jarrett](/wiki/Ned_Jarrett \"Ned\nJarrett\") became the promoter.[2] Gant excelled on the asphalt, and won his\nfirst race in the sportsman division.\n\nHe won over 300 races with the car builder and crew chief Kenneth H. Sigmon,\nin the NASCAR Sportsman on his way to winning three national championships, in\n1972, 1973, and 1974.

He made six starts over\nthe next four years and had two top-ten finishes. His first full season in\nWinston Cup was in 1979. He competed for the rookie of the year honors against\n[Dale Earnhardt](/wiki/Dale_Earnhardt \"Dale Earnhardt\") and [Terry\nLabonte](/wiki/Terry_Labonte \"Terry Labonte\"). He finished fourth in the\noverall rookie battle in the No. 47 [Race Hill\nFarm](/w/index.php?title=Race_Hill_Farm&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Race Hill Farm\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") car for [Jack Beebe](/wiki/Jack_Beebe \"Jack Beebe\").\nHe split the next season between the No. 47 and the No. 75 [RahMoc\nEnterprises](/wiki/RahMoc_Enterprises \"RahMoc Enterprises\") entry, finishing\n21st in points.\n\nAfter starting out the 1981 season driving for various teams, he moved to the\nNo. 33 Skoal Bandit [Pontiac](/wiki/Pontiac \"Pontiac\"), which was owned by\n[Hal Needham](/wiki/Hal_Needham \"Hal Needham\") and [Burt\nReynolds](/wiki/Burt_Reynolds \"Burt Reynolds\"), and [Leo\nJackson](/wiki/Andy_Petree_Racing \"Andy Petree Racing\") after 1988. Gant\ndebuted with the team by placing second at [Darlington\nRaceway](/wiki/Darlington_Raceway \"Darlington Raceway\"), followed by five more\nsecond-place finishes and three poles, ending the season third in points\nstandings.[3] He stayed with the team for the rest of his career.\n\nGant finished second 10 times before winning his first Winston Cup race, at\nMartinsville April 25, 1982, in the [Virginia National Bank\n500](/wiki/Goody%27s_Cool_Orange_500 \"Goody's Cool Orange 500\") and he would\nfinish fourth in the final points standings. In 1983, Gant would only win once\nat Darlington in the Transouth 400 and collect 10 top 5's and 16 top ten\nfinishes en route to seventh in the final points standings. In 1984, Harry\nGant notched 3 poles, 15 top five finishes, and 23 top ten finishes and won at\nPocono and Martinsville in the fall, he would end up finishing second to\neventual Winston Cup champion [Terry Labonte](/wiki/Terry_Labonte \"Terry\nLabonte\"). In 1985, Gant would win at Martinsville in the spring, and at Dover\nand at North Wilkesboro in the fall, notching a career best for Gant up to\nthat point. He would finish third in championship standings, 259 points behind\neventual champion Darrell Waltrip. Gant would go winless for three years from\n1986-1988 and in 1989, he would break a three year winless streak winning at\nDarlington in the spring which caused the veteran driver to exclaim \"The\nBandit is back\" in victory lane.[4]. He would not win again in 1989 but he\nwould finish seventh in the final points standings.\n\nGant won the [International Race of\nChampions](/wiki/International_Race_of_Champions \"International Race of\nChampions\") (IROC) championship in 1985.[5] He tied on points with [Darrell\nWaltrip](/wiki/Darrell_Waltrip \"Darrell Waltrip\") but was awarded the title on\ntiebreak by finishing higher in the final race: a photo-finish win over\nLabonte at [Michigan International\nSpeedway](/wiki/Michigan_International_Speedway \"Michigan International\nSpeedway\")\n\nGant drove the No. 33 in the 1985 Talladega NASCAR race with the first\ntelemetry data system ever installed on a race car. The data from the car was\nsent to the CBS television network and broadcast during the TV coverage of the\nrace.\n\n## 1990's and Mr. September\nstreak[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Gant&action=edit&section=4&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: 1990's and Mr. September streak\")]\n\nHarry Gant entered the decade with a win at Pocono in the spring of 1990. He\nwould finish 17th in the final points standings with 6 top 5's and 9 top 10's.\nIn 1991, Gant would have a career year. He won the 1991 Winston 500 in the\nspring. He gambled on fuel mileage and won. Fellow competitor Rick Mast\ndrafted behind Gant to give him a push the last few laps but let off in the\nfinal laps to preserve the victory. Gant earned the nickname \"Mr. September\"\nin 1991 after winning all four September Cup races (Darlington, Richmond,\nDover and Martinsville) and two Busch races (Richmond and Dover) at age 51.\nHis crew chief was [Andy Petree](/wiki/Andy_Petree \"Andy Petree\").[6] The four\nconsecutive cup victories tied the modern era record set in 1972. Dominating\nat the next race at [North Wilkesboro\nSpeedway](/wiki/North_Wilkesboro_Speedway \"North Wilkesboro Speedway\"), Gant\nhad his brakes fail, ending his hopes of five consecutive victories[7]. Gant\nwould get 5 victories in 1991, and would notch 15 top five finishes and 17 top\ntens and he would finish fourth in the final point standings. Gant would\nfollow up 1991 with a strong 1992 and finish 4th in points again and was one\nof five drivers in contention for the championship but six finishes of 13th or\nworse in the final races doomed his championship hopes. Gant would win at\nDover in the spring and he would get his last Cup victory on August 16, 1992,\nat the [Champion Spark Plug 400](/wiki/3M_Performance_400 \"3M Performance\n400\") at Michigan International Speedway, gambling on fuel. This would also be\nthe final victory for Oldsmobile in Cup competition. Harry Gant and the Leo\nJackson team would switch to Chevrolets in 1993 and at the end of the season\nGant announced that 1994 would be his last season. Gant finished his career\nwith a pole and seven top ten finishes and finished 25th in the final point\nstandings.\n\nIn 1996, Gant substituted for the injured [Bill Elliott](/wiki/Bill_Elliott\n\"Bill Elliott\") in the 1996 [Winston Select](/wiki/NASCAR_Sprint_All-Star_Race\n\"NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race\"), driving Elliott's No. 94\n[McDonald's](/wiki/McDonald%27s \"McDonald's\") [Ford\nThunderbird](/wiki/Ford_Thunderbird \"Ford Thunderbird\") after Elliott's\ninjuries at Talladega.[8] Gant also ran a partial season in the Craftsman\nTruck Series in 1996, driving his own No. 33 Westview Capital [Chevrolet\nC/K](/wiki/Chevrolet_C/K \"Chevrolet C/K\"). He was inducted into the\n[International Motorsports Hall of\nFame](/wiki/International_Motorsports_Hall_of_Fame \"International Motorsports\nHall of Fame\") on April 27, 2006.\n\nCurrently, Gant continues to work on his 300-acre ranch in North Carolina and\nenjoys riding his motorcycle. In 2015, he was in attendance at Darlington for\nthe Southern 500 to take part in the retro weekend. He also still works on\nroofs and carpentry in his spare time. Gant once admitted that he \"was a good\nrace car driver, but a great carpenter\".\n\n## Cup\nrecords[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Gant&action=edit&section=5&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Cup records\")]\n\nHe holds the record as the oldest driver ever to win a [Cup\nSeries](/wiki/Sprint_Cup_Series \"Sprint Cup Series\") race (52 years, 219 days)\nand as the oldest driver ever to collect his first career Cup victory (42\nyears and 105 days). He is the second oldest driver to win in NASCAR's second-\nlevel circuit, now known as the [Xfinity Series](/wiki/Xfinity_Series \"Xfinity\nSeries\"), after [Dick Trickle](/wiki/Dick_Trickle \"Dick Trickle\")[9] In his\ncareer he has collected 18 Cup wins and one runner-up finish in 1984 and third\nin 1981 and 1985, 21 Busch Series wins, and three runner-up finishes in the\nBusch Series championship (69, 76, and 77). In 1985 won the IROC title. He won\nfour races in a row in 1991 tying a \"new era\" (1972–present) record and came\nin second in the fifth race. His five Winston Cup and five Busch Grand\nNational wins in 1991 made him the only driver, at that time, to post the most\nwins in both series in the same year, although he tied with Davey Allison with\nfive Cup wins (Allison also scored a victory in the non-points All-Star Race).\n\n## Movie\nappearances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Gant&action=edit&section=6&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Movie appearances\")]\n\nHe appeared in the 1983 [Burt Reynolds](/wiki/Burt_Reynolds \"Burt Reynolds\")\nmovie _[Stroker Ace](/wiki/Stroker_Ace \"Stroker Ace\")_. He also gave a short\ninterview in the film _[Days of Thunder](/wiki/Days_of_Thunder \"Days of\nThunder\")_ and was mentioned for spinning out in the Daytona 500 late in the\nmovie (although it was actually the No. 26 of [Brett\nBodine](/wiki/Brett_Bodine \"Brett Bodine\")).
