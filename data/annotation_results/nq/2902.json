A child of the 20th century, a product of the population explosion, and one of the inheritors of the legacy of progress. Mr. Beechcroft again, this time Act Two of his daily battle for survival, and in just a moment our hero will begin his personal one-man rebellion against the mechanics of his age, and to do so he will enlist certain aides available only in the Twilight Zone.\" | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \n##\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mind_and_the_Matter&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nMr. Archibald Beechcroft, who has had an insufferable time getting to work,\nbecomes annoyed when an errand boy named Henry spills coffee all over his\nsuit. Taking some aspirin in the bathroom, he encounters his boss, Mr. Rogers,\nwho advises him that he needs to keep fit to avoid headaches. Annoyed,\nBeechcroft says he's fed up with the crowded conditions at the office and\nwants to eliminate all the people of the world.\n\nLater Henry, still feeling guilty about spilling the coffee, saves Beechcroft\na seat in the cafeteria. He also presents Beechcroft a book titled _The Mind\nand the Matter_ , which deals with the ultimate in concentration. The book\nintrigues Beechcroft as he starts to leaf through it in the cafeteria, and he\ncontinues to read it on the subway ride home. In his apartment, he reads the\nlast page, and then concludes that the authors are indeed correct that\nconcentration is the greatest power in the universe. It then occurs to him\nthat he can use concentration to realize his dream of eliminating people. He\ntests his theory out on his landlady, whom he successfully makes disappear.\n\nThe next day, Beechcroft concentrates while in the subway and all the other\ncommuters disappear. Beechcroft walks into the office to find it totally\nempty. Though he takes satisfaction in his newfound peace and quiet, he soon\ngrows extremely bored with being the last person in existence. After trying\nout diversions such as an earthquake or electrical storm, Beechcroft goes home\nfor the night. To overcome his loss of purpose, Beechcroft comes up with the\nidea of repopulating the world in his image. This proves to be an even bigger\nmistake, since everybody else ends up being as anti-social, rude and cranky as\nBeechcroft. The people even look and sound like him.\n\nBeechcroft returns the world to the way it used to be, now convinced that, for\nall its nuisances, it is the best of all possible worlds. Henry spills coffee\non Beechcroft again, then asks him if he enjoyed reading _The Mind and the\nMatter_. Beechcroft pretends to dismiss the book as \"totally unbelievable.\"\n\n## Closing\nnarration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Mind_and_the_Matter&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Closing narration\")]\n\n“ | \"Mr. Archibald Beechcroft, a child of the twentieth century, who has found out through trial and error – and mostly error – that with all its faults, it may well be that this is the best of all possible worlds.
