According to the prevailing\nmedical misconception of that time, it was believed that his illness was\ndirectly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration; however, Harrison's\nillness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event. The cold\nworsened, rapidly turning to [pneumonia](/wiki/Pneumonia \"Pneumonia\") and\n[pleurisy](/wiki/Pleurisy \"Pleurisy\").[12] He sought to rest in the White\nHouse, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office\nseekers. His extremely busy social schedule made any rest time scarce.[13]\n\nHarrison's doctors tried cures, applying [opium](/wiki/Opium \"Opium\"), [castor\noil](/wiki/Castor_oil \"Castor oil\"), [leeches](/wiki/Leeches \"Leeches\"), and\n[Virginia snakeroot](/wiki/Aristolochia_serpentaria \"Aristolochia\nserpentaria\"). But the treatments only made Harrison worse, and he became\ndelirious. He died nine days after becoming ill,[14] at 12:30 am on April 4,\n1841, of right lower lobe [pneumonia](/wiki/Pneumonia \"Pneumonia\"),\n[jaundice](/wiki/Jaundice \"Jaundice\"), and overwhelming\n[septicemia](/wiki/Septicemia \"Septicemia\"). He was the first United States\npresident to die in office.

Taylor died in the White House at\n10:35 p.m. on July 9, five days after becoming ill.[21] Contemporary reports\nlisted the cause of death as \"bilious diarrhea, or a bilious cholera\".[22] He\nwas succeeded by Vice President [Millard Fillmore](/wiki/Millard_Fillmore\n\"Millard Fillmore\").\n\nAlmost immediately after his death, rumors began to circulate that Taylor was\npoisoned by pro-slavery Southerners, and similar theories persisted into the\ntwentieth century.[23] The remains were exhumed and transported to the Office\nof the [Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky \"Kentucky\") Chief Medical Examiner on June\n17, 1991. [Neutron activation analysis](/wiki/Neutron_activation_analysis\n\"Neutron activation analysis\") conducted at [Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory](/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory \"Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory\") revealed no evidence of poisoning, as [arsenic](/wiki/Arsenic\n\"Arsenic\") levels were too low.[24][25] The analysis concluded Taylor had\ncontracted \"[cholera morbus](/wiki/Cholera_morbus \"Cholera morbus\"), or [acute\ngastroenteritis](/wiki/Acute_gastroenteritis \"Acute gastroenteritis\")\", as\nWashington had open sewers, and his food or drink may have been\ncontaminated.[26]\n\nTaylor was interred in the Public Vault of the [Congressional\nCemetery](/wiki/Congressional_Cemetery \"Congressional Cemetery\") in\nWashington, D.C. from July 13, 1850 to October 25, 1850. (It was built in 1835\nto hold remains of notables until either the grave site could be prepared or\ntransportation arranged to another city.)

Arthur](/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur \"Chester A.\nArthur\"), succeeded Garfield as President. Garfield also lived the longest\nafter the shooting, compared to other assassinated Presidents. Garfield was\nscheduled to leave Washington on July 2, 1881 for his summer vacation.[40] On\nthat day, Guiteau lay in wait for the President at the [Baltimore and Potomac\nRailroad](/wiki/Baltimore_and_Potomac_Railroad \"Baltimore and Potomac\nRailroad\") station, on the southwest corner of present-day Sixth Street and\nConstitution Avenue NW, [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington,\nD.C.\")[41]\n\nPresident Garfield came to the Sixth Street Station on his way to his [alma\nmater](/wiki/Alma_mater \"Alma mater\"), [Williams\nCollege](/wiki/Williams_College \"Williams College\"), where he was scheduled to\ndeliver a speech. Garfield was accompanied by two of his sons,\n[James](/wiki/James_Rudolph_Garfield \"James Rudolph Garfield\") and\n[Harry](/wiki/Harry_Augustus_Garfield \"Harry Augustus Garfield\"), and\n[Secretary of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United States\nSecretary of State\") [Blaine](/wiki/James_G._Blaine \"James G. Blaine\").\n[Secretary of War](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War \"United States\nSecretary of War\") [Robert Todd Lincoln](/wiki/Robert_Todd_Lincoln \"Robert\nTodd Lincoln\") waited at the station to see the President off.[42] Garfield\nhad no bodyguard or security detail; with the exception of Abraham Lincoln\nduring the [Civil War](/wiki/United_States_Civil_War \"United States Civil\nWar\"), early U.S. presidents never used any guards.[43]\n\nAs President Garfield entered the waiting room of the station Guiteau stepped\nforward and pulled the trigger from behind at point-blank range. \"My God, what\nis that?\" Garfield cried out, flinging up his arms. Guiteau fired again and\nGarfield collapsed.[44] One bullet grazed Garfield's shoulder; the other hit\nhim in the back, passing the first [lumbar vertebra](/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae\n\"Lumbar vertebrae\") but missing the [spinal cord](/wiki/Spinal_cord \"Spinal\ncord\") before coming to rest behind his pancreas.[45]\n\nGarfield, conscious but in shock, was carried to an upstairs floor of the\ntrain station.[46] One bullet remained lodged in his body, but doctors could\nnot find it.[47] Young Jim Garfield and James Blaine both broke down and wept.\nRobert Todd Lincoln, deeply upset and thinking back to the death of his\nfather, said \"How many hours of sorrow I have passed in this town.\"[47]\n\nGarfield was carried back to the White House. Although doctors told him that\nhe would not survive the night, the President remained conscious and\nalert.[48] The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to\nhope for recovery.[49] A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing\nregular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the\nsummer of 1881.[50][51] His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went.\nGarfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating\nlittle, and that only liquids.[52]\n\nGarfield had been a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one\nof the nation’s premier summer vacation spots until World War I. In early\nSeptember, it was decided to bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to\nthe south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover.\nWhen they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local\ncitizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling\nGarfield to be brought directly to the door of the oceanfront Franklyn\ncottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train\nstation. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd\nidentifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.\n\nChester Arthur was at his home in New York City on the night of September 19,\nwhen word came that Garfield had died. After first getting the news, Arthur\nsaid \"I hope—my God, I do hope it is a mistake.\" But confirmation by telegram\ncame soon after. Arthur took the presidential oath of office, administered by\na New York Supreme Court judge, then left for Long Branch to pay his respects\nbefore going on to Washington.[53] Garfield's body was taken to Washington,\nwhere it lay in state for two days in the Capitol Rotunda before being taken\nto Cleveland, where the funeral was held on September 26.[54]\n\nWhen the tracks that had been hastily built to the Franklyn cottage were later\ntorn up, actor Oliver Byron bought the wooden ties, and had local carpenter\nWilliam Presley build them into a small tea house, in commemoration of the\npresident. The red & white (originally red, white & blue) \"Garfield Tea House\"\nstill survives, resting a couple of blocks away from the site of the cottage\non the grounds of the Long Branch Historical Museum, a former Episcopal\nChurch. The church is nicknamed \"The Church of the Presidents\", as it had been\nattended by, in addition to Garfield, Presidents Chester A. Arthur, Ulysses S.\nGrant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford Hayes, William McKinley, and Woodrow\nWilson, during their own visits to Long Branch.\n\n## 1901: William\nMcKinley[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 1901: William McKinley\")]\n\n[![A black-and-white drawing of a crowd of people, one of whom is being\nwatched by all the others, all standing under a draped\nbanner](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/McKinleyAssassination.jpg/220px-\nMcKinleyAssassination.jpg)](/wiki/File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Leon Czolgosz](/wiki/Leon_Czolgosz \"Leon Czolgosz\") shoots\n[President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\") [McKinley](/wiki/William_McKinley \"William McKinley\") with a\nconcealed revolver.

His death quickly led to theories that he had\nbeen poisoned[62] or committed suicide. Rumors of poisoning were fueled, in\npart, by a book called _The Strange Death of President Harding,_ in which the\nauthor (convicted criminal, former Ohio Gang member, and detective [Gaston\nMeans](/wiki/Gaston_Means \"Gaston Means\"), hired by Mrs. Harding to\ninvestigate Warren Harding and his mistress) suggested that Mrs. Harding had\npoisoned her husband after learning of his infidelity. Mrs. Harding's refusal\nto allow an autopsy on President Harding only added to the speculation.\nAccording to the physicians attending Harding, however, the symptoms in the\ndays prior to his death all pointed to [congestive heart\nfailure](/wiki/Congestive_heart_failure \"Congestive heart failure\"). Harding's\nbiographer, Samuel H. Adams, concluded that \"Warren G.

Upon her\nreturn to [Marion](/wiki/Marion,_Ohio \"Marion, Ohio\"), Mrs. Harding hired a\nnumber of secretaries to collect and burn President Harding's personal papers.\nAccording to Mrs. Harding, she took these actions to protect her husband's\nlegacy. The remaining papers were held and kept from public view by the\n_Harding Memorial Association_ in Marion.[64]\n\n## 1945: Franklin D.\nRoosevelt[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: 1945: Franklin D. Roosevelt\")]\n\nOn March 29, 1945, [Franklin D. Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt\n\"Franklin D. Roosevelt\") went to the [Little White\nHouse](/wiki/Little_White_House \"Little White House\") at [Warm Springs,\nGeorgia](/wiki/Warm_Springs,_Georgia \"Warm Springs, Georgia\"), to rest before\nhis anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the [United\nNations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\"). On the afternoon of April 12,\nRoosevelt said, \"I have a terrific pain in the back of my head.\" He then\nslumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom.\nThe president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive\n[cerebral hemorrhage](/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage \"Cerebral hemorrhage\")\n(stroke).[65] At 3:35 pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining\nconsciousness. As [Allen Drury](/wiki/Allen_Drury \"Allen Drury\") later said,\n“so ended an era, and so began another.” After Roosevelt's death, an editorial\nby _The New York Times_ declared, \"Men will thank God on their knees a hundred\nyears from now that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House\".[66]\n\n[![A black-and-white photograph of a wagon being drawn and accompanied by\nseven white horses, some of which are being ridden by\npeople](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Franklin_Roosevelt_funeral_procession_1945.jpg/220px-\nFranklin_Roosevelt_funeral_procession_1945.jpg)](/wiki/File:Franklin_Roosevelt_funeral_procession_1945.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Franklin_Roosevelt_funeral_procession_1945.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRoosevelt's horse-drawn casket proceeds down [Pennsylvania\nAvenue](/wiki/Pennsylvania_Avenue_\\(Washington,_D.C.\\) \"Pennsylvania Avenue\n\\(Washington, D.C.\\)\") during his funeral procession.\n\nIn his later years at the White House, when Roosevelt was increasingly\noverworked, his daughter [Anna Roosevelt Boettiger](/wiki/Anna_E._Roosevelt\n\"Anna E. Roosevelt\") had moved in to provide her father companionship and\nsupport. Anna had also arranged for her father to meet with his former\nmistress, the now widowed [Lucy Mercer\nRutherfurd](/wiki/Lucy_Page_Mercer_Rutherfurd \"Lucy Page Mercer Rutherfurd\").\nA close friend of both Roosevelt and Mercer who was present, [Elizabeth\nShoumatoff](/wiki/Elizabeth_Shoumatoff \"Elizabeth Shoumatoff\"), rushed Mercer\naway to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. When Eleanor\nheard about her husband's death, she was also faced with the news that Anna\nhad been arranging these meetings with Mercer and that Mercer had been with\nFranklin when he died.[67]\n\nOn the morning of April 13, Roosevelt's body was placed in a flag-draped\ncoffin and loaded onto the presidential train. After a White House funeral on\nApril 14, Roosevelt was transported back to Hyde Park by train, guarded by\nfour servicemen, one each from the Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard. As\nwas his wish, Roosevelt was buried in the Rose Garden of the [Springwood\nestate](/wiki/Home_of_Franklin_D._Roosevelt_National_Historic_Site \"Home of\nFranklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site\"), the Roosevelt family home in\nHyde Park on April 15. Eleanor died in November 1962 and was buried next to\nhim.[68]\n\nRoosevelt's death was met with shock and grief[69] across the U.S. and around\nthe world. His declining health had not been known to the general public.\nRoosevelt had been president for more than 12 years, longer than any other\nperson, and had led the country through some of its greatest crises to the\nimpending defeat of Nazi Germany and within sight of the defeat of Japan as\nwell.\n\nLess than a month after his death, on May 8, the war in Europe ended.\nPresident [Harry S. Truman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S. Truman\"), who\nturned 61 that day, dedicated [Victory in Europe\nDay](/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day \"Victory in Europe Day\") and its celebrations\nto Roosevelt's memory, and kept the flags across the U.S. at half-staff for\nthe remainder of the 30-day mourning period. In doing so, Truman said that his\nonly wish was \"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\"[70]\n\n## 1963: John F.\nKennedy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: 1963: John F.

It also concluded that [Jack Ruby](/wiki/Jack_Ruby \"Jack\nRuby\") acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody.
