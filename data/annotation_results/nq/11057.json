In [Luke\n1:31](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Luke#1:31\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Luke\") an angel tells Mary to name her\nchild Jesus, and in [Matthew\n1:21](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Matthew#1:21\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Matthew\") an angel tells Joseph to\nname the child Jesus. The statement in Matthew 1:21 \"you shall call his name\nJesus, for he will save his people from their sins\" associates\n[salvific](/wiki/Christian_soteriology \"Christian soteriology\") attributes to\nthe name Jesus in Christian theology.[2][3][12][13]\n\nAlthough the precise difference between a 'name' and a 'title' may be open to\ninterpretation, 198 different names and titles of Jesus in the Bible are\nlisted in [Cruden's Concordance](/wiki/Cruden%27s_Concordance \"Cruden's\nConcordance\"), first published in 1737, and continuously in print ever since.\nThe first index of the book (following the royal dedications and author's\npreface) is entitled \"A collection of the Names and Titles given to Jesus\nChrist\", with 198 names listed, each accompanied by a biblical reference.[14]\n\n####\nEtymology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Etymology\")]\n\nThere have been a number of proposals as to the origin and etymological origin\nof the name Jesus (cf. [Matthew\n1:21](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:Matthew.1:21–1:21)). The name is\nrelated to the [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language \"Hebrew language\") form\n[Yehoshua`] יְהוֹשֻׁעַ‬ [Joshua](/wiki/Joshua \"Joshua\"), which is a\n[theophoric name](/wiki/Theophoric_name \"Theophoric name\") first mentioned\nwithin the [Biblical tradition](/wiki/Bible \"Bible\") in [Exodus\n17:9](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0217.htm#9) referring to one of\n[Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\")' companions (and his successor as leader of the\nIsraelites). This name is usually considered to be a compound of two parts:\nיהו‬ _Yeho_ , a theophoric reference to [YHWH](/wiki/YHWH \"YHWH\"), the\ndistinctive personal name of the [God of Israel](/wiki/Yahweh \"Yahweh\"), plus\na form derived from the Hebrew [triconsonantal root](/wiki/Triconsonantal_root\n\"Triconsonantal root\") _y-š-ʕ_ or י-ש-ע \"to liberate, save\". There have been\nvarious proposals as to how the literal etymological meaning of the name\nshould be translated, including:[15][16][17][18][19]\n\n    \n\n  * YHWH saves\n  * YHWH (is) salvation\n  * YHWH (is) a saving-cry\n  * YHWH (is) a cry-for-saving\n  * YHWH (is) a cry-for-help\n  * YHWH (is) my help\n\nThis early Biblical Hebrew name יְהוֹשֻׁעַ‬ [Yehoshua`] underwent a shortening\ninto later Biblical יֵשׁוּעַ‬ [Yeshua`], as found in the Hebrew text of verses\nEzra 2:2, 2:6, 2:36, 2:40, 3:2, 3:8, 3:9, 3:10, 3:18, 4:3, 8:33; Nehemiah\n3:19, 7:7, 7:11, 7:39, 7:43, 8:7, 8:17, 9:4, 9:5, 11:26, 12:1, 12:7, 12:8,\n12:10, 12:24, 12:26; 1 Chronicles 24:11; and 2 Chronicles 31:15—as well as in\n[Biblical Aramaic](/wiki/Biblical_Aramaic \"Biblical Aramaic\") at verse Ezra\n5:2. These Bible verses refer to ten individuals (in Nehemiah 8:17, the name\nrefers to [Joshua](/wiki/Joshua \"Joshua\") son of Nun). This historical change\nmay have been due to a phonological shift whereby guttural phonemes weakened,\nincluding [h].[20] Usually, the traditional theophoric element [Yahu] יהו‬ was\nshortened at the beginning of a name to יו‬ [Yo-], and at the end to יה‬\n[-yah]. In the contraction of [Yehoshua`] to [Yeshua`], the vowel is instead\nfronted (perhaps due to the influence of the _y_ in triliteral root _y-š-ʕ_).\nDuring the post-Biblical period, the name was also adopted by Aramaic and\nGreek-speaking Jews.\n\nPart of [a series](/wiki/Category:Jesus \"Category:Jesus\") on  \n---

\"Septuagint\") had already\ntransliterated ישוע [Yeshua`] into [Koine Greek](/wiki/Koine_Greek \"Koine\nGreek\") as closely as possible in the 3rd-century [BCE](/wiki/BCE \"BCE\"), the\nresult being Ἰησοῦς [Iēsous]. Since Greek had no equivalent to the Semitic\nletter ש‬ _shin_ [sh], it was replaced with a σ _sigma_ [s], and a masculine\nsingular ending [-s] was added in the nominative case, in order to allow the\nname to be inflected for case (nominative, accusative, etc.) in the grammar of\nthe Greek language. The diphthongal [a] vowel of Masoretic [Yehoshua`] or\n[Yeshua`] would not have been present in Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation during\nthis period, and some scholars believe some dialects dropped the\n[pharyngeal](/wiki/Pharyngeal_consonant \"Pharyngeal consonant\") sound of the\nfinal letter ע‬ _`ayin_ [`], which in any case had no counterpart in ancient\nGreek. The Greek writings of [Philo of Alexandria](/wiki/Philo_of_Alexandria\n\"Philo of Alexandria\")[21] and [Josephus](/wiki/Josephus \"Josephus\")\nfrequently mention this name. It also occurs in the Greek New Testament at\nActs 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8, referring to Joshua son of Nun.\n\nFrom Greek, Ἰησοῦς [Iēsous] moved into [Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") at least\nby the time of the [Vetus Latina](/wiki/Vetus_Latina \"Vetus Latina\"). The\nmorphological jump this time was not as large as previous changes between\nlanguage families. Ἰησοῦς [Iēsous] was [transliterated](/wiki/Transliterated\n\"Transliterated\") to Latin _IESVS_ , where it stood for many centuries. The\nLatin name has an irregular declension, with a genitive, dative, ablative, and\nvocative of _Jesu_ , accusative of _Jesum_ , and nominative of _Jesus_.\n[Minuscule](/wiki/Lower_case \"Lower case\") (lower case) letters were developed\naround 800 and some time later the [U](/wiki/U \"U\") was invented to\ndistinguish the [vowel](/wiki/Vowel \"Vowel\") sound from the\n[consonantal](/wiki/Consonant \"Consonant\") sound and the [J](/wiki/J \"J\") to\ndistinguish the consonant from [I](/wiki/I \"I\"). Similarly, Greek minuscules\nwere invented about the same time, prior to that the name was written in\n[Capital letters](/wiki/Capital_letters \"Capital letters\"): ΙΗϹΟΥϹ or\nabbreviated as: ΙΗϹ with a line over the top, see also\n[Christogram](/wiki/Christogram \"Christogram\").\n\n[Modern English](/wiki/Modern_English \"Modern English\")\n\"[Jesus](/wiki/Jesus_\\(name\\) \"Jesus \\(name\\)\")\"\n[/ˈdʒiːzəs/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\") derives from Early\nMiddle English _Iesu_ (attested from the 12th century). The name participated\nin the [Great Vowel Shift](/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift \"Great Vowel Shift\") in\nlate [Middle English](/wiki/Middle_English \"Middle English\") (15th century).\nThe letter [J](/wiki/J \"J\") was first distinguished from 'I' by the Frenchman\n[Pierre Ramus](/wiki/Petrus_Ramus \"Petrus Ramus\") in the 16th century, but did\nnot become common in Modern English until the 17th century, so that early 17th\ncentury works such as the first edition of the [King James Version of the\nBible](/wiki/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible \"King James Version of the\nBible\") (1611) continued to print the name with an I.[22]\n\n#### \"Jesu\"\nforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: \"Jesu\" forms\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg/40px-Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png) | Look up _**[Jesu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Jesu \"wiktionary:Jesu\")**_ in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.  \n---|---  \n  \n\"Jesu\" is a remnant in modern English of the [declension](/wiki/Declension\n\"Declension\") and use of grammatically inflected [case\nendings](/wiki/Case_ending \"Case ending\") with some proper nouns in [Middle\nEnglish](/wiki/Middle_English \"Middle English\"), which persisted into [Early\nModern English](/wiki/Early_Modern_English \"Early Modern English\") to around\nthe time of [Shakespeare](/wiki/Shakespeare \"Shakespeare\"). The form Jesu is\noften a [vocative](/wiki/Vocative \"Vocative\"), \"Jesu!\", but may also stand for\nother cases, such as [genitive](/wiki/Genitive \"Genitive\"), as in Latin. The\nform \"Jesu\" was preserved in hymns and poetry long after it had fallen out of\ngeneral use in speech, for example in [poet\nlaureate](/wiki/Poet_Laureate_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Poet Laureate of the\nUnited Kingdom\") [Robert Bridges](/wiki/Robert_Bridges \"Robert Bridges\")'\ntranslation of [Johann Schop](/wiki/Johann_Schop \"Johann Schop\")'s wording for\nthe English translation of [Johann Sebastian Bach](/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach\n\"Johann Sebastian Bach\")'s cantata, _[Jesu, Joy of Man's\nDesiring](/wiki/Jesu,_Joy_of_Man%27s_Desiring \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\")_\nand in T.

It means\n\"[anointed one](/wiki/Anointing \"Anointing\")\".[33] The Greek is a loan\ntranslation of the Hebrew _mashiaħ_ (מָשִׁיחַ) or Aramaic _mshiħa_\n(מְשִׁיחָא), from which we derive the English word [Messiah](/wiki/Messiah\n\"Messiah\"). Christ has now become a name, one part of the name \"Jesus Christ\",\nbut originally it was a title (the Messiah) and not a name; however its use in\n\"Christ Jesus\" is a title.[34][35][36]\n\nIn the [Septuagint](/wiki/Septuagint \"Septuagint\") version of the [Hebrew\nBible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible \"Hebrew Bible\") (written over a century before the\ntime of Jesus), the word _Christos_ was used to translate into Greek the\n[Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_\\(language\\) \"Hebrew \\(language\\)\") _mashiach_\n(messiah), meaning \"anointed.\"[37][38] (Another Greek word, _Messias_ appears\nin Daniel 9:26 and Psalm 2:2.[39][40]) The [New Testament](/wiki/New_Testament\n\"New Testament\") states that the Messiah, long-awaited, had come and describes\nthis savior as _The Christ._ In [Matthew\n16:16](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Matthew#16:16\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Matthew\") Apostle Peter, in what has\nbecome a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first\ncentury, said, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"[41] In [John\n11:27](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/John#11:27\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/John\") Martha tells Jesus \"you are the\nChrist\", just before the [Raising of Lazarus](/wiki/Raising_of_Lazarus\n\"Raising of Lazarus\").[42]\n\nIn the [Pauline Epistles](/wiki/Pauline_Epistles \"Pauline Epistles\") the word\nChrist is so closely associated with Jesus that it is apparent that for the\nearly Christians there is no need to claim that Jesus is Christ, for that is\nconsidered widely accepted among them. Hence Paul can use the term _Christos_\nwith no confusion as to whom it refers to, and as in [First Corinthians\n4:15](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/1Corinthians#4:15\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/1Corinthians\") and [Romans\n12:5](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Romans#12:5\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Romans\") he can use expressions such\nas \"in Christ\" to refer to the followers of Jesus.[43]\n\nSymbols for representing Christ (i.e. [Christograms](/wiki/Christogram\n\"Christogram\")) were developed by early Christians, e.g. the _[Chi\nRho](/wiki/Chi_Rho \"Chi Rho\")_ symbol formed by superimposing the first two\nGreek letters in Christ ( [Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\") :\n\"Χριστός\" ), [chi](/wiki/Chi_\\(letter\\) \"Chi \\(letter\\)\") = ch and\n[rho](/wiki/Rho_\\(letter\\) \"Rho \\(letter\\)\") = r, to produce ☧.[44]\n\n###\nLord[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Lord\")]\n\nSee also: [Jesus is Lord](/wiki/Jesus_is_Lord \"Jesus is Lord\"),\n[Christology](/wiki/Christology \"Christology\"), and [Kyrios](/wiki/Kyrios\n\"Kyrios\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Christogram_with_Jesus_Prayer_in_Romanian.jpg/130px-\nChristogram_with_Jesus_Prayer_in_Romanian.jpg)](/wiki/File:Christogram_with_Jesus_Prayer_in_Romanian.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Christogram_with_Jesus_Prayer_in_Romanian.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Chi Rho](/wiki/Chi_Rho \"Chi Rho\") circled with the Prayer: \"_Lord Jesus\nChrist, Son of God, have mercy on me_ \".\n\nEarly Christians viewed Jesus as \"the Lord\" and the Greek word\n_[Kyrios](/wiki/Kyrios \"Kyrios\")_ (κύριος) which may mean [God](/wiki/God\n\"God\"), [lord](/wiki/Lord \"Lord\") or master appears over 700 times in the [New\nTestament](/wiki/New_Testament \"New Testament\"), referring to him.[45][46] In\neveryday [Aramaic](/wiki/Aramaic \"Aramaic\"), _Mari_ was a very respectful form\nof polite address, well above \"Teacher\" and similar to [Rabbi](/wiki/Rabbi\n\"Rabbi\"). In Greek this has at times been translated as Kyrios. While the term\nMari expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his\nlife, the Greek Kyrios came to represent his lordship over the world.[47]\n\n[Pauline writings](/wiki/Pauline_Christianity \"Pauline Christianity\") further\nestablished the various theological consequences of the Lord/Kyrios concept\namong early Christians, and emphasized the attributes of Jesus as not only\nreferring to his eschatological victory, but to him as the \"divine image\"\n([Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\") εἰκών _eikōn_) in whose face\nthe glory of God shines forth.[48] In [Romans\n10:9–13](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Romans#10:9\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Romans\") Paul emphasized the\n[salvific](/wiki/Salvation_in_Christianity \"Salvation in Christianity\") value\nof the title, and stated that confessing by mouth (_homologeo_) the belief\nthat Jesus is Lord (_Kyrion Iesoun_) signifies one's salvation.[49]\n\nThe high frequency of the use of the term Kyrios in the [Acts of the\nApostles](/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles \"Acts of the Apostles\") indicates how\nnatural it was for [early Christians](/wiki/Early_Christianity \"Early\nChristianity\") to refer to Jesus in this way.[45] This title persisted among\nChristians as the predominant perception of Jesus for a number of\ncenturies.[48]\n\nThe use of the _Kyrios title_ for Jesus is central to the development of New\nTestament [Christology](/wiki/Christology \"Christology\"), for the early\nChristians placed it at the center of their understanding and from that center\nattempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian\nmysteries.[50] The question of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is\ninherently related to the Kyrios title of Jesus used in the early Christian\nwritings and its implications for the absolute lordship of Jesus. In early\nChristian belief, the concept of Kyrios included the [Pre-existence of\nChrist](/wiki/Pre-existence_of_Christ \"Pre-existence of Christ\") for they\nbelieved that if Christ is one with God, he must have been united with God\nfrom the very beginning.[46][50]\n\nThe title, even in the Greek form, continues to be widely used in Christian\n[liturgy](/wiki/Liturgy \"Liturgy\"), e.g. in the [Kyrie](/wiki/Kyrie \"Kyrie\")\neleison, Christe eleison combination (i.e. _Lord have mercy_ , _Christ have\nmercy_), where Jesus is referred to as Lord in one case, and as\n[Christ](/wiki/Christ \"Christ\") immediately thereafter.[51]\n\n###\nMaster[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Master\")]\n\nThe Greek word _[Epistates](/wiki/Epistates \"Epistates\")_ (_Epistata_ in the\n[vocative case](/wiki/Vocative_case \"Vocative case\")) is used only in Luke's\ngospel, where it occurs six times. Robert O'Toole argues that the word relates\nto Jesus power over the material world rather than his teaching.[52] Some\ncommentators suggest that in [Luke 5](/wiki/Luke_5 \"Luke 5\"), Peter progresses\nfrom seeing Jesus as \"Master\" (v. 5) to seeing him as \"Lord\" (v. 8).[53]\n\n### Logos (the\nWord)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Logos \\(the Word\\)\")]\n\nMain articles: [Logos (Christianity)](/wiki/Logos_\\(Christianity\\) \"Logos\n\\(Christianity\\)\"), [Pre-existence of Christ](/wiki/Pre-existence_of_Christ\n\"Pre-existence of Christ\"), [Person of Christ](/wiki/Person_of_Christ \"Person\nof Christ\"), and [Hypostatic union](/wiki/Hypostatic_union \"Hypostatic union\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Prologus_Ioanni_Vulgata_Clementina.jpg/180px-\nPrologus_Ioanni_Vulgata_Clementina.jpg)](/wiki/File:Prologus_Ioanni_Vulgata_Clementina.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Prologus_Ioanni_Vulgata_Clementina.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_In principio erat verbum_ , [Latin](/wiki/Latin_\\(language\\) \"Latin\n\\(language\\)\") for _At the beginning there was the Word_.

The statement that the\nLogos was \"with God\" asserts the distinction of Jesus from God. The statement\nthat the Logos \"was God\" states the unity of Jesus with God, thus stating his\ndivinity.[56][59]\n\nIn [1 John\n1:1](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/1_John#1:1\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/1 John\") the arrival of the Logos as\n\"the Word of life\" from the beginning is emphasized and [1 John\n5:6](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/1_John#5:6\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/1 John\") builds on it to emphasize the\nwater and blood of incarnation.[56] With the use of the title Logos, Johannine\n[Christology](/wiki/Christology \"Christology\") consciously affirms the belief\nin the divinity of Jesus: that he was God who came to be among men as the Word\nIncarnate.[56][58][60]\n\nAlthough as of the 2nd century the use of the title Logos gave rise to debate\nbetween the Alexandrian and Antiochian schools of thought regarding the\ninteraction of the human and divine elements in the [Person of\nChrist](/wiki/Person_of_Christ \"Person of Christ\"), after the [First Council\nof Nicaea](/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea \"First Council of Nicaea\") in 325 and\n[Council of Chalcedon](/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon \"Council of Chalcedon\") in\n451 the Logos and the second person of the [Trinity](/wiki/Holy_Trinity \"Holy\nTrinity\") were often used interchangeably.[58][61][62][63]\n\n### Son of\nGod[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Son of God\")]\n\nMain article: [Son of God (Christianity)](/wiki/Son_of_God_\\(Christianity\\)\n\"Son of God \\(Christianity\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Sargis_Pitsak.jpg/130px-\nSargis_Pitsak.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sargis_Pitsak.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sargis_Pitsak.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFirst page of [Mark](/wiki/Gospel_of_Mark \"Gospel of Mark\"): \"_The beginning\nof the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God_ \", by [Sargis\nPitsak](/wiki/Sargis_Pitsak \"Sargis Pitsak\") 14th century.\n\nThe title \"Son of God\" is applied to Jesus in many cases in the New\nTestament.[64] It is often used to refer to his divinity, from the beginning\nin the [Annunciation](/wiki/Annunciation \"Annunciation\") up to the\n[Crucifixion](/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus \"Crucifixion of Jesus\").[64] The\ndeclaration that Jesus is the Son of God is made by many individuals in the\nNew Testament, on two separate occasions by [God the\nFather](/wiki/God_the_Father \"God the Father\") as a voice from Heaven, and is\nalso asserted by Jesus himself.[64][65][66][67] The Son of God title,\naccording to most [Christian denominations](/wiki/Christian_denominations\n\"Christian denominations\"), [Trinitarian](/wiki/Trinitarianism\n\"Trinitarianism\") in belief, refers to the relationship between\n[Jesus](/wiki/Jesus \"Jesus\") and [God](/wiki/God \"God\"), specifically as \"[God\nthe Son](/wiki/God_the_Son \"God the Son\")\".[65][67]\n\nFor thousands of years, emperors and rulers ranging from the [Western Zhou\ndynasty](/wiki/Western_Zhou_dynasty \"Western Zhou dynasty\") (c. 1000 B.C.) in\nChina to [Alexander the Great](/wiki/Alexander_the_Great \"Alexander the\nGreat\") in Greece have assumed titles that reflect a filial relationship with\n[deities](/wiki/Deity \"Deity\").[68][69] At the time of Jesus, Roman Emperor\n[Augustus](/wiki/Augustus \"Augustus\") exploited the similarity between the\ntitles [Divi filius](/wiki/Divi_filius \"Divi filius\") (son of the Divine One)\nand \"Dei filius\" (Son of God) and used the ambiguous inscription \"DF\" to refer\nto himself to emphasize the divine component of his image.[70][71][72][73] [J.\nD.

When, in Matthew 16:15–16, [Apostle\nPeter](/wiki/Apostle_Peter \"Apostle Peter\") states, \"You are Christ, the Son\nof the living God\", Jesus not only accepts the titles, but calls Peter\n\"blessed\" and declares the profession a divine revelation, unequivocally\ndeclaring himself to be both Christ and the Son of God in [Matthew\n16:15-16](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Matthew#16:15\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Matthew\").[65][65]\n\nIn the new Testament, Jesus uses the term \"my Father\" as a direct and\nunequivocal assertion of his sonship, and a unique relationship with the\nFather beyond any attribution of titles by others, e.g., in [Matthew\n11:27](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Matthew#11:27\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Matthew\"), [John\n5:23](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/John#5:23\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/John\") and [John\n5:26](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/John#5:26\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/John\").[67][76][77] In a number of\nother episodes, Jesus claims sonship by referring to the Father, e.g., in Luke\n2:49, when he is [found in the temple](/wiki/Finding_in_the_Temple \"Finding in\nthe Temple\"), a young Jesus calls the temple \"my Father's house\", just as he\ndoes later in John 2:16 in the [Cleansing of the\nTemple](/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple \"Cleansing of the Temple\") episode.[67]\nIn Matthew 1:11 and Luke 3:22, Jesus allows himself to be called the Son of\nGod by the voice from above, not objecting to the title.[67]\n\nOf all the [Christological](/wiki/Christology \"Christology\") titles used in\nthe New Testament, Son of God has had one of the most lasting impacts in\nChristian history and has become part of the profession of faith by many\nChristians.[78] In the mainstream [Trinitarian](/wiki/Trinitarianism\n\"Trinitarianism\") context, the title implies the full divinity of Jesus as\npart of the [Holy Trinity](/wiki/Holy_Trinity \"Holy Trinity\") of\n[Father](/wiki/God_the_Father \"God the Father\"), Son and the\n[Spirit](/wiki/Holy_Spirit \"Holy Spirit\").[78] However, the concept of God as\nthe father of Jesus and Jesus as the one and only Son of God is distinct from\nthe concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in\nthe [Apostle's Creed](/wiki/Apostle%27s_Creed \"Apostle's Creed\").[79] The\nprofession begins with expressing belief in the \"Father almighty, creator of\nheaven and earth\" and then immediately, but separately, in \"Jesus Christ, his\nonly Son, our Lord\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood within the\nCreed.[79]\n\n### Son of\nMan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Son of Man\")]\n\nMain article: [Son of man (Christianity)](/wiki/Son_of_man_\\(Christianity\\)\n\"Son of man \\(Christianity\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/BL_Harley_Gospels_109r.jpg/130px-\nBL_Harley_Gospels_109r.jpg)](/wiki/File:BL_Harley_Gospels_109r.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:BL_Harley_Gospels_109r.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Son of man\" appears 25 times in [Luke](/wiki/Gospel_of_Luke \"Gospel of\nLuke\"), a [copy c. 800](/wiki/Harley_Golden_Gospels \"Harley Golden Gospels\")\nshown here.[80]\n\nThe term Son of man appears many times in all four gospel accounts, e.g. 30\ntimes in Matthew.[80] However, unlike the title [Son of God](/wiki/Son_of_God\n\"Son of God\"), its proclamation has never been an article of faith in\nChristianity.[81] While the profession of Jesus as the Son of God has been an\nessential element of Christian creeds since the [Apostolic\nage](/wiki/Apostolic_age \"Apostolic age\"), such professions do not apply to\nSon of man. Yet, the [Christological](/wiki/Christology \"Christology\")\nanalysis of the relationship between the two terms has been the subject of\nmuch research.[81]\n\nIn modern biblical research the occurrences of Son of man in the [Synoptic\ngospels](/wiki/Synoptic_gospel \"Synoptic gospel\") are generally categorized\ninto three groups: those that refer to his \"coming\" (as an exaltation), those\nthat refer to \"suffering\" and those that refer to \"now at work\", i.e.\nreferring to the earthly life.[80][82][83]\n\nThe presentation in the [Gospel of John](/wiki/Gospel_of_John \"Gospel of\nJohn\") is somewhat different from the Synoptics and in John 1:51 he is\npresented as contact with God through \"angelic instrumentality\", in John 6:26\nand 6:53 he provides life through his death and in John 5:27 he holds the\npower to judge men.[80] The first chapter of the [Book of\nRevelation](/wiki/Book_of_Revelation \"Book of Revelation\") refers to \"one like\na Son of man\" in [Revelation\n1:12–13](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Revelation#1:12\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Revelation\") which radiantly stands in\nglory and speaks to the author.[84] In the Gospel of John Jesus is not just a\n[messianic](/wiki/Messiah \"Messiah\") figure, nor a prophet like Moses, but the\nkey emphasis is on his dual role as [Son of God](/wiki/Son_of_God \"Son of\nGod\") and [Son of man](/wiki/Son_of_man \"Son of man\").[85]\n\nAlthough Son of man is a distinct from Son of God, some gospel passages equate\nthem in some cases, e.g. in [Mark\n14:61](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Mark#14:61\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Mark\"), during the [Sanhedrin trial of\nJesus](/wiki/Sanhedrin_trial_of_Jesus \"Sanhedrin trial of Jesus\") when the\nhigh priest asked Jesus: \"Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed one?\"\nJesus responded \"I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right\nhand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.\".[83][86] This builds on\nthe statement in [Mark\n9:31](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Mark#9:31\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Mark\") that \"The Son of man is\ndelivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is\nkilled, after three days he shall rise again.\"[83] In the parable of [the\nSheep and the Goats](/wiki/The_Sheep_and_the_Goats \"The Sheep and the Goats\"),\nthe returning Son of man has the power to judge, by separating men from \"all\nthe nations\" into distinct groups, in Matthew 25:31–46.[83]\n\nFor centuries, the Christological perspective on Son of man has been a natural\ncounterpart to that of Son of God and in many cases affirms the humanity of\nJesus just as Son of God affirms his divinity.[82] In the 5th century, [Saint\nAugustine](/wiki/Saint_Augustine \"Saint Augustine\") viewed the duality of Son\nof God and Son of man in terms of the dual nature of Christ in [hypostatic\nunion](/wiki/Hypostatic_union \"Hypostatic union\"), in that the Son of God\nbecame the Son of man through the act of [Incarnation](/wiki/Incarnation\n\"Incarnation\") and wrote: \"Since he is the only Son of God by nature, he\nbecame also the Son of Man that he might be full of grace as well.\"[87][88]\n\n[Geza Vermes](/wiki/Geza_Vermes \"Geza Vermes\") has argued that \"the son of\nman\" in the Gospels is unrelated to these [Hebrew Bible](/wiki/Hebrew_Bible\n\"Hebrew Bible\") usages. He begins with the observation that there is no\nexample of \"the\" son of man in Hebrew sources. He suggests that the term\noriginates in [Aramaic](/wiki/Aramaic_language \"Aramaic language\")— _bar\nnash/bar nasha_. Based on his study of Aramaic sources, he concludes that in\nthese sources: (1) \"Son of man\" is a regular expression for _man_ in general.\n(2) It often serves as an indefinite pronoun (\"one\" or \"someone\"). (3) In\ncertain circumstances it may be employed as a\n[circumlocution](/wiki/Circumlocution \"Circumlocution\"). In monologues or\ndialogues the speaker can refer to himself, not as 'I', but as \"the son of\nman\" in the third person, in contexts implying awe, reserve, or modesty. (4)\nIn none of the extant texts does \"son of man\" figure as a title.[89]\n\n### Son of\nDavid[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Son of David\")]\n\nThe title \"Son of David\" indicates Jesus' physical descent from\n[David](/wiki/David \"David\"), as well as his membership of the [Davidic\nline](/wiki/Davidic_line \"Davidic line\") of kings. The phrase is used a number\nof times in the [gospel of Matthew](/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew \"Gospel of\nMatthew\"). It appears in [Matthew 1:1](/wiki/Matthew_1:1 \"Matthew 1:1\") to\nintroduce both the [genealogy](/wiki/Genealogy_of_Jesus \"Genealogy of Jesus\")\nand the gospel. It is found on the lips of the [blind men healed in\nGalilee](/wiki/Healing_the_two_blind_men_in_Galilee \"Healing the two blind men\nin Galilee\") (\"Have mercy on us, Son of David\", [Matthew\n9:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209:27–9:27&version=nkjv)),\nthe crowd who are amazed at Jesus' healing of a blind, mute and demon-\npossessed man [Matthew\n12:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:23–12:23&version=nkjv)),\nthe [Canaanite woman whose daughter is\nexorcised](/wiki/Exorcising_the_Canaanite_woman%27s_daughter \"Exorcising the\nCanaanite woman's daughter\") (\"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me,\" [Matthew\n15:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2015:22–15:22&version=nkjv)),\nand the [blind men healed near Jericho](/wiki/Healing_the_blind_near_Jericho\n\"Healing the blind near Jericho\") (\"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us\",\n[Matthew\n20:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2020:30–20:30&version=nkjv)).\nFinally, it also forms part of the shout of the crowds when [Jesus enters\nJerusalem](/wiki/Triumphal_entry_into_Jerusalem \"Triumphal entry into\nJerusalem\"): \"Hosanna to the Son of David\" (Matthew 21:9).\n\nA variant of this title is found in [Revelation\n22:16](http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Revelation+22:16–22:16&version=nrsv),\nwhere Jesus refers to himself as \"the Root and the Offspring of David\".\n\nAccording to Anglican Bishop [Charles Ellicott](/wiki/Charles_Ellicott\n\"Charles Ellicott\"), \"Son of David\" was \"the most popular of all the names of\nthe expected Christ\".[90]\n\n### Lamb of\nGod[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Lamb of God\")]\n\nMain article: [Lamb of God](/wiki/Lamb_of_God \"Lamb of God\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Agnus_Dei_with_Vexillum.jpg/140px-\nAgnus_Dei_with_Vexillum.jpg)](/wiki/File:Agnus_Dei_with_Vexillum.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Agnus_Dei_with_Vexillum.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA typical depiction of [Agnus Dei](/wiki/Agnus_Dei \"Agnus Dei\"), bleeding into\na [Holy Chalice](/wiki/Holy_Chalice \"Holy Chalice\") and carrying a Christian\nvictory banner.\n\nThe title _Lamb of God_ ([Agnus Dei](/wiki/Agnus_Dei \"Agnus Dei\")) only\nappears in the [Gospel of John](/wiki/Gospel_of_John \"Gospel of John\"), with\nthe exclamation of [John the Baptist](/wiki/John_the_Baptist \"John the\nBaptist\"): \"Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world\" in\n[John\n1:29](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/John#1:29\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/John\"), the title reaffirmed the next\nday in [John\n1:36](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/John#1:36\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/John\").[91] The second use of the\ntitle Lamb of God takes place in the presence of the first two\n[apostles](/wiki/Twelve_apostles \"Twelve apostles\") of Jesus, who immediately\nfollow him, address him as [Rabbi](/wiki/Rabbi \"Rabbi\") with respect and later\nin the narrative bring others to meet him.[92]\n\nThese two proclamations of Jesus as the Lamb of God closely bracket the\nBaptist's other proclamation in [John\n1:34](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/John#1:34\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/John\"): \"I have borne witness that\nthis is the Son of God\". From a [Christological](/wiki/Christology\n\"Christology\") perspective, these proclamations and the descent of the [Holy\nSpirit](/wiki/Holy_Spirit \"Holy Spirit\") as a dove in John 1:32 reinforce each\nother to establish the divine element of the [Person of\nChrist](/wiki/Person_of_Christ \"Person of Christ\").[91] In Johannine\nChristology the proclamation \"who takes away the sins of the world\" begins the\nunfolding of the [salvific](/wiki/Salvation_in_Christianity \"Salvation in\nChristianity\") theme of the redemptive and sacrificial death of Jesus followed\nby his resurrection which is built upon in other proclamations such as \"this\nis indeed the Saviour of the world\" uttered by the Samaritans in [John\n4:42](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/John#4:42\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/John\").[93][94] However, nothing in\nthe context of [1 Corinthians\n5:7](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/1_Corinthians#5:7\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/1 Corinthians\") directly implies that\nin that specific passage [Saint Paul](/wiki/Saint_Paul \"Saint Paul\") refers\nthe death of Jesus using the same theme.[95]\n\nThe [Book of Revelation](/wiki/Book_of_Revelation \"Book of Revelation\")\nincludes over twenty references to a lion-like lamb (\"slain but standing\")\nwhich delivers victory in a manner reminiscent of the resurrected Christ.[96]\nIn the first appearance of the lamb in Revelation\n([5:1-7](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Revelation#5:1\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Revelation\")) only the lamb (which is\nof the tribe of Judah, and the root of David) is found worthy to take the\njudgment scroll from God and break the seals. In [Revelation\n21:14](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Revelation#21:14\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Revelation\") the lamb is said to have\ntwelve apostles.[96]\n\nThe theme of a sacrificial lamb which rises in victory as the [Resurrected\nChrist](/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus \"Resurrection of Jesus\") was employed in\nearly Christology, e.g. in 375 [Saint Augustine](/wiki/Saint_Augustine \"Saint\nAugustine\") wrote: \"Why a lamb in his passion? For he underwent death without\nbeing guilty of any inequity. Why a lion in his resurrection? For in being\nslain, he slew death.\"[97] The Lamb of God title has found widespread use in\nChristian prayers and the _Agnus Dei_ (\"Lamb of God who take away the sins of\nthe world have mercy on us; Lamb of God who take away the sins of the world\ngrant us peace\") is used both in [liturgy](/wiki/Liturgy \"Liturgy\") and as a\nform of [contemplative prayer](/wiki/Contemplative_prayer \"Contemplative\nprayer\").[98][99]\n\n### New Adam / Second Adam / Last\nAdam[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: New Adam / Second Adam / Last Adam\")]\n\nMain article: [Last Adam](/wiki/Last_Adam \"Last Adam\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Kariye_ic.jpg/200px-\nKariye_ic.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kariye_ic.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kariye_ic.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Resurrected Jesus pulls [Adam and Eve](/wiki/Adam_and_Eve \"Adam and Eve\")\nout of their graves, with Satan bound in Hell, [Chora\nChurch](/wiki/Chora_Church \"Chora Church\"), Istanbul, c. 1315.\n\n> Just as in Adam all of us died, so too in Christ all of us will be brought\n> to life.\n>\n> — [1 Corinthians\n> 15:22](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/1_Corinthians#15:22\n> \"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/1 Corinthians\")\n\nJust as the [Gospel of John](/wiki/Gospel_of_John \"Gospel of John\") proclaims\nthe universal relevance of the Incarnation of Jesus as [Logos](/wiki/Logos\n\"Logos\"), the Pauline view emphasizes the cosmic view that his birth,\n[Crucifixion](/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus \"Crucifixion of Jesus\") and\n[Resurrection](/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus \"Resurrection of Jesus\") brought\nforth a new man and a [new world](/wiki/World_to_Come \"World to Come\").[34]\nPaul's [eschatological](/wiki/Eschatology \"Eschatology\") view of Jesus\ncounter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to\n[Adam](/wiki/Adam \"Adam\"). Unlike Adam, the new man born in Jesus obeys God\nand ushers in a world of morality and salvation.[100]\n\nIn the Pauline view, Adam is positioned as the first man and Jesus as the\nsecond and last Adam ([1 Corinthians\n15:45](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/1_Corinthians#15:45\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/1 Corinthians\")), the first having\ncorrupted himself by his disobedience, also infected humanity and left it with\na curse as inheritance. The birth of Jesus, on the other hand, counterbalanced\nthe fall of Adam, bringing forth redemption and repairing the damage done by\nAdam.[101]\n\nThe theme is reiterated by Paul, in [Romans\n5:18-21](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Romans#5:18\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Romans\"), when he states:\n\n> Therefore just as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all, so one\n> man's act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all.

Both uses of the title lead to dramatic results in the New Testament\naccounts.

The use of the term \"King\" in\nthe charges brought against Jesus is central in the decision to crucify\nhim.[114] In [John\n19:12](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/John#19:12\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/John\") Pilate seeks to release Jesus,\nbut the Jews object, saying: \"If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's\nfriend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar\" bringing\nthe power of Caesar to the forefront of the discussion for the assumption of\nthe title King implies rebellion against the [Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire\n\"Roman Empire\")[113][114]\n\nThe final use of the title only appears in [Luke\n23:36-37](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Luke#23:36\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Luke\").

translates this as \"teacher\", a\n[Rabbi](/wiki/Rabbi \"Rabbi\") being a Jewish teacher, or master.[117] In the\nNew Testament, the term _Rhabbouni_ is only used by the Magdalene here in John\n20:16

Elsewhere, in\n[Luke\n7:39](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Luke#7:39\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Luke\") the Jews again doubt that Jesus\nis a prophet.[132] The view of Jesus as a prophet is used in the concept of\n[threefold office](/wiki/Threefold_office \"Threefold office\") which sees his 3\nroles as \"Prophet, Priest and King\".[134] While during [early\nChristianity](/wiki/Early_Christianity \"Early Christianity\") there were people\nclaiming to be prophets, there are no records of anyone else claiming to be a\nprophet during the life of Jesus.[133]\n\nIn [John\n14:16](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/John#14:16\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/John\") Jesus said he will ask the\nFather to send \"another\" [paraclete](/wiki/Paraclete \"Paraclete\"), i.e.\ncomforter.[135] The term paraclete only appears in [Johannine\nliterature](/wiki/Johannine_literature \"Johannine literature\") and apart from\nthe four uses in the [Gospel of John](/wiki/Gospel_of_John \"Gospel of John\")\nit appears only in [1 John\n2:1](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/1_John#2:1\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/1 John\").[135] Given that [1 John\n2:1](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/1_John#2:1\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/1 John\") views Jesus as a paraclete,\nthe reference in John 14:16 states that Jesus sends a second paraclete to\ncontinue the life of the Church after his departure.[135] The statement\nregarding the paraclete is made within the \"farewell discourse\" during the\n[Last Supper](/wiki/Last_Supper \"Last Supper\") of Jesus and the Apostles.[136]\nThe paraclete is thus a link between the [ministry of\nJesus](/wiki/Ministry_of_Jesus \"Ministry of Jesus\") and the future life of the\nChurch.[136]\n\nSome titles of Jesus are unique to the [Book of\nRevelation](/wiki/Book_of_Revelation \"Book of Revelation\"); he is referred to\nas Faithful and True in [Revelation\n19:11](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Revelation#19:11\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Revelation\"), the [Alpha and\nOmega](/wiki/Alpha_and_Omega \"Alpha and Omega\") in [Revelation\n22:13](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Revelation#22:13\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Revelation\") and elsewhere and the\nMorning Star in [Revelation\n22:16](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_\\(American_Standard\\)/Revelation#22:16\n\"wikisource:Bible \\(American Standard\\)/Revelation\").\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Jesus in Christianity](/wiki/Jesus_in_Christianity \"Jesus in Christianity\")\n  * [Jesus as Wisdom](/wiki/Sophia_\\(wisdom\\)#Christology \"Sophia \\(wisdom\\)\")\n  * [Life of Jesus in the New Testament](/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament \"Life of Jesus in the New Testament\")\n  * [List of Christian synonyms](/wiki/List_of_Christian_synonyms \"List of Christian synonyms\")\n  * [Names of God in Christianity](/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Christianity \"Names of God in Christianity\")\n  * [New Testament places associated with Jesus](/wiki/New_Testament_places_associated_with_Jesus \"New Testament places associated with Jesus\")\n  * [Redeemer (Christianity)](/wiki/Redeemer_\\(Christianity\\) \"Redeemer \\(Christianity\\)\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** _Names and Titles of the Lord Jesus Christ_. by Charles Spear 2003 [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-7661-7467-0](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-7661-7467-0 \"Special:BookSources/0-7661-7467-0\") pages ix-x\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _Bible explorer 's guide_ by John Phillips 2002 [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-8254-3483-1](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8254-3483-1 \"Special:BookSources/0-8254-3483-1\") page 147\n  3. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _All the Doctrines of the Bible_ by Herbert Lockyer 1988 [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-310-28051-6](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-310-28051-6 \"Special:BookSources/0-310-28051-6\") page 159\n  4. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _Theology of the New Testament_ by Georg Strecker, Friedrich Wilhelm Horn 2000 [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-664-22336-2](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-664-22336-2 \"Special:BookSources/0-664-22336-2\") page 89\n  5. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _Jesus: a Gospel portrait_ by Donald Senior 1992 [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-8091-3338-5](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8091-3338-5 \"Special:BookSources/0-8091-3338-5\") pages 145-147\n  6. **Jump up ^** _The Titles of Jesus in Christology: Their History in Early Christianity_ by Ferdinand Hahn, Harold Knight, George Ogg 2002 [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-227-17085-7](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-227-17085-7 \"Special:BookSources/0-227-17085-7\") pages 11-12\n  7. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _Outlines of dogmatic theology, Volume 2 by Sylvester Hunter 2010[ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [1-146-98633-5](/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-146-98633-5 \"Special:BookSources/1-146-98633-5\") page 443_\n  8. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _Jesus: the complete guide_ by Leslie Houlden 2006 [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-8264-8011-X](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8264-8011-X \"Special:BookSources/0-8264-8011-X\") page 426\n  9. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ [Catholic encyclopedia: Holy Name of Jesus](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07421a.htm)\n  10. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _Spiritual theology_ by Jordan Aumann 1980 [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-7220-8518-4](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-7220-8518-4 \"Special:BookSources/0-7220-8518-4\") page 411\n  11. **Jump up ^** _Dictionary of Premillennial Theology_ by Mal Couch 1997 [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-8254-2410-0](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8254-2410-0 \"Special:BookSources/0-8254-2410-0\") page 210\n  12. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _Matthew_ by [Thomas G.
