        "# United States presidential line of succession\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe **United States presidential line of succession** is the order in which\npersons may become or act as [President of the United\nStates](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United States\")\nif the [incumbent](/wiki/Incumbent \"Incumbent\") President becomes\n[incapacitated](/wiki/Capacity_\\(law\\) \"Capacity \\(law\\)\"), dies, resigns, or\nis removed from office (by\n[impeachment](/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States \"Impeachment in the\nUnited States\") by the [House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/House_of_Representatives_of_the_United_States \"House of\nRepresentatives of the United States\") and subsequent\n[conviction](/wiki/Conviction \"Conviction\") by the\n[Senate](/wiki/Senate_of_the_United_States \"Senate of the United States\")).\nThe line of succession is set by the United States Constitution and the\n[Presidential Succession Act of 1947](/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act\n\"Presidential Succession Act\")[1] as subsequently amended to include newly\ncreated cabinet offices. The succession follows the order of [Vice\nPresident](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States \"Vice President of the\nUnited States\"), [Speaker of the House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Speaker of the United States House of Representatives\"), [President pro\ntempore of the Senate](/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate\n\"President pro tempore of the United States Senate\"), and then the heads of\n[federal executive\ndepartments](/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments \"United States\nfederal executive departments\") who form the [Cabinet of the United\nStates](/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States \"Cabinet of the United States\").\nThe Cabinet currently has fifteen members, beginning with the [Secretary of\nState](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_of_the_United_States \"Secretary of State of\nthe United States\"), and followed by the rest in the order of their positions'\ncreation. Those heads of department who are ineligible to act as President are\nalso ineligible to succeed the President by succession, for example most\ncommonly if they are not a [natural-born U.S. citizen](/wiki/Natural-born-\ncitizen_clause \"Natural-born-citizen clause\").\n\nSeveral constitutional law experts have raised questions as to the\nconstitutionality of the provisions that the Speaker of the House and the\nPresident pro tempore of the Senate succeed to the presidency,[2] and in 2003\nthe [Continuity of Government\nCommission](/wiki/Continuity_of_Government_Commission \"Continuity of\nGovernment Commission\") raised a number of other issues with the current line\nof succession.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Current order\n  * 2 Eligibility\n    * 2.1

These eligibility requirements are\nspecified both in the U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 1, Clause 5, and\nin the [Presidential Succession Act of 1947](/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act\n\"Presidential Succession Act\") ([3\nU.S.C.](/wiki/Title_3_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 3 of the United States\nCode\") [§ 19(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19#e)).\n\n### Acting\nofficers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Acting officers\")]\n\n[Acting](/wiki/Acting_\\(law\\) \"Acting \\(law\\)\") officers may be eligible.

(We have spoken to acting secretaries who\n> told us they had been placed in the line of succession.)[5]\n\n## Motivation for changes to the succession in\n1945[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Motivation for changes to the succession in 1945\")]\n\nTwo months after succeeding [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\"), President\n[Harry S. Truman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S. Truman\") proposed that the\n[Speaker of the\nHouse](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Speaker of\nthe United States House of Representatives\") and the [President pro tempore of\nthe Senate](/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate \"President\npro tempore of the United States Senate\") be granted priority in the line of\nsuccession over the [Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States \"Cabinet of\nthe United States\") so as to ensure the President would not be able to appoint\nhis successor to the Presidency.[6]\n\nThe [Secretary of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United States\nSecretary of State\") and the other [Cabinet\nofficials](/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States \"Cabinet of the United States\")\nare appointed by the President, while the Speaker of the House and the\nPresident pro tempore of the Senate are elected officials. The Speaker is\nchosen by the [U.S. House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\"), and every Speaker has been a member of that body\nfor the duration of their term as Speaker, though this is not technically a\nrequirement; the President pro tempore is chosen by the [U.S.\nSenate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\") and customarily the\nSenator of the majority party with the longest record of continuous service\nfills this position. The [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United\nStates Congress\") approved this change and inserted the Speaker and President\npro tempore in line, ahead of the members of the Cabinet in the order in which\ntheir positions were established.\n\nIn his speech supporting the changes, Truman noted that the House of\nRepresentatives is more likely to be in political agreement with the President\nand Vice President than the Senate. The succession of a Republican to a\nDemocratic Presidency would further complicate an already unstable political\nsituation. However, when the changes to the succession were signed into law,\nthey placed Republican House Speaker [Joseph W. Martin](/wiki/Joseph_W._Martin\n\"Joseph W. Martin\") first in the line of succession after the Vice\nPresident.[7]\n\nSome of Truman's critics said that his ordering of the Speaker before the\nPresident pro tempore was motivated by his dislike of the then-current holder\nof the latter rank, Senator [Kenneth\nMcKellar](/wiki/Kenneth_McKellar_\\(politician\\) \"Kenneth McKellar\n\\(politician\\)\").[8] Further motivation may have been provided by Truman's\npreference for House Speaker [Sam Rayburn](/wiki/Sam_Rayburn \"Sam Rayburn\") to\nbe next in the line of succession, rather than Secretary of State [Edward R.\nStettinius, Jr.](/wiki/Edward_R._Stettinius,_Jr. \"Edward R. Stettinius,\nJr.\")[7]\n\n## Constitutional\nprovisions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Constitutional provisions\")]\n\nThe line of succession is mentioned in three places in the Constitution:\n\n  * [Article II, Section 1, Clause 6](/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_6:_Vacancy_and_disability \"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") makes the Vice President first in the line of succession and allows the [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") to provide by law for cases in which neither the President nor Vice President can serve. The current such law governing succession is the [Presidential Succession Act of 1947](/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act \"Presidential Succession Act\") ([3 U.S.C.](/wiki/Title_3_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 3 of the United States Code\") [§ 19](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19)).\n  * [Section 3 of the 20th Amendment](/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text \"Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") provides that if the [President-elect](/wiki/President-elect_of_the_United_States \"President-elect of the United States\") dies before his term begins, the Vice President-elect becomes President on [Inauguration Day](/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration \"United States presidential inauguration\") and serves for the full term to which the President-elect was elected. The section also provides that if, on Inauguration Day, a president has not been chosen or the President-elect does not qualify for the presidency, the Vice President-elect acts as president until a president is chosen or the President-elect qualifies. Finally, Section 3 allows the Congress to provide by law for cases in which neither a President-elect nor a Vice President-elect is eligible or available to serve.\n  * The [25th Amendment](/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), ratified in 1967, clarified Article II, Section 1: that the Vice President is the direct successor of the President. He or she becomes President if the President dies, resigns or is removed from office. The amendment also provides for the situation where the President is temporarily disabled, such as if the President has a surgical procedure or becomes mentally unfit.  \nThe amendment also provides for Vice Presidential succession, by requiring\nVice Presidential vacancies to be filled by the President and confirmed by\nboth houses of the Congress. Previously, whenever a Vice President had\nsucceeded to the Presidency or had otherwise left the office empty (through\ndeath, resignation, or removal from office), the Vice Presidency remained\nvacant until the next Presidential and Vice Presidential terms began.\n\n## Acting President and\nPresident[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Acting President and President\")]\n\nMain article: [Acting President of the United\nStates](/wiki/Acting_President_of_the_United_States \"Acting President of the\nUnited States\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Lyndon_B._Johnson_taking_the_oath_of_office%2C_November_1963.jpg/275px-\nLyndon_B._Johnson_taking_the_oath_of_office%2C_November_1963.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lyndon_B._Johnson_taking_the_oath_of_office,_November_1963.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Lyndon_B._Johnson_taking_the_oath_of_office,_November_1963.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nNew President [Lyndon Johnson](/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson \"Lyndon B.

Kennedy assassination\") [John\nF. Kennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F.

Feerick](/wiki/John_Feerick \"John Feerick\"),[9] have\nargued that the framers' intention was that the Vice President would remain\nVice President while executing the powers and duties of the Presidency;\nhowever, there is also much evidence to the contrary, the most compelling of\nwhich is [Article I, section\n3](/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_3:_Senate\n\"Article One of the United States Constitution\"), of the Constitution itself,\nthe relevant text of which reads:\n\n> The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate,\n> but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.  \n>  The Senate shall chuse [_[sic](/wiki/Sic \"Sic\")_] their other officers, and\n> also a President pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, or when\n> he shall **exercise** the **office of President** of the United States.\n\nThis text appears to answer the hypothetical question of whether the _office_\nor merely the _powers_ of the Presidency devolved upon the Vice President on\nhis succession. Thus, the 25th Amendment merely restates and reaffirms the\nvalidity of existing precedent, apart from adding new protocols for\nPresidential disability.[_[original\nresearch?](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research \"Wikipedia:No original\nresearch\")_] Not everyone agreed with this interpretation when it was first\nactually tested, and it was left to Vice President [John\nTyler](/wiki/John_Tyler \"John Tyler\"), the first presidential successor in\nU.S. history, to establish the precedent that was respected in the absence of\nthe 25th Amendment.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/John_Tyler.jpg/170px-\nJohn_Tyler.jpg)](/wiki/File:John_Tyler.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:John_Tyler.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIn 1841, [John Tyler](/wiki/John_Tyler \"John Tyler\") became the first person\nto succeed to the presidency.\n\nUpon the death of President [William Henry\nHarrison](/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison \"William Henry Harrison\") in 1841 and\nafter a brief hesitation, Tyler took the position that he _was_ the President\nand _not_ merely [acting\nPresident](/wiki/Acting_President_of_the_United_States \"Acting President of\nthe United States\") upon taking the [presidential oath of\noffice](/wiki/Oath_of_office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States \"Oath of\noffice of the President of the United States\"). However, some\ncontempories—including [John Quincy Adams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John\nQuincy Adams\"),[9][10] Henry Clay[11] and other members of Congress[10][11]\nWhig party leaders[11] and even Tyler's own cabinet[10][11]—believed that he\nwas only acting as President and did not have the office itself.\n\nNonetheless, Tyler adhered to his position, even returning, unopened, mail\naddressed to the \"Acting President of the United States\" sent by his\ndetractors.[12] Tyler's view ultimately prevailed when the Senate voted to\naccept the title \"President,\"[11] and this precedent was followed thereafter.\nThe question was finally resolved by Section 1 of the [25th\nAmendment](/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), which specifies\nthat \"In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or\nresignation, _the Vice President shall**become** President.\"_ The Amendment\ndoes not specify whether officers other than the Vice President can become\nPresident rather than Acting President in the same set of circumstances.

The act was contentious because the\n[Federalists](/wiki/Federalist_Party \"Federalist Party\") did not want the then\nSecretary of State, [Thomas Jefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas\nJefferson\"), who had become the leader of the [Democratic-\nRepublicans](/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party \"Democratic-Republican Party\"),\nto follow the Vice President in the succession. There were also [separation of\npowers](/wiki/Separation_of_powers \"Separation of powers\") concerns over\nincluding the [Chief Justice of the United\nStates](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States \"Chief Justice of the United\nStates\") in the line. The compromise they worked out established the President\npro tempore of the Senate as next in line after the Vice President, followed\nby the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nIn either case, these officers were to \"act as President of the United States\nuntil the disability be removed or a president be elected.\" The Act called for\na special election to be held in November of the year in which dual vacancies\noccurred (unless the vacancies occurred after the first Wednesday in October,\nin which case the election would occur the following year; or unless the\nvacancies occurred within the last year of the presidential term, in which\ncase the next election would take place as regularly scheduled). The people\nelected President and Vice President in such a special election would have\nserved a full four-year term beginning on March 4 of the next year, but no\nsuch election ever took place.\n\n### Presidential Succession Act\n1886[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Presidential Succession Act 1886\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png) | [Wikisource](/wiki/Wikisource \"Wikisource\") has original text related to this article: **[Presidential Succession Act 1886](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act_1886 \"wikisource:Presidential Succession Act 1886\")**  \n---|---  \n  \nIn 1881, after the death of President [Garfield](/wiki/James_A._Garfield\n\"James A.

When Congress convened in December\n1885, President [Cleveland](/wiki/Grover_Cleveland \"Grover Cleveland\") asked\nfor a revision of the 1792 act, which was passed in 1886. Congress replaced\nthe President pro tempore and Speaker with officers of the President's\n[Cabinet](/wiki/United_States_Cabinet \"United States Cabinet\") with the\nSecretary of State first in line. In the first 100 years of the United States,\nsix former [Secretaries of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State\n\"United States Secretary of State\") had gone on to be elected President, while\nonly two congressional leaders had advanced to that office.

The office of\n[Secretary of the Navy](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Navy \"United\nStates Secretary of the Navy\"), which had existed as a Cabinet-level position\nsince 1798, had become subordinate to the Secretary of Defense in the military\nreorganization, and so was dropped from the line of succession in the 1947\nSuccession Act.\n\n### Postmaster General removed\n1971[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Postmaster General removed 1971\")]\n\nUntil 1971, the [Postmaster General](/wiki/United_States_Postmaster_General\n\"United States Postmaster General\"), the head of the [Post Office\nDepartment](/wiki/United_States_Post_Office_Department \"United States Post\nOffice Department\"), was a member of the [Cabinet](/wiki/United_States_Cabinet\n\"United States Cabinet\"), initially the last in the presidential line of\nsuccession before new officers were added. Once the Post Office Department was\nre-organized into the [United States Postal\nService](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service \"United States Postal Service\"), a\nspecial agency independent of the executive branch, the Postmaster General\nceased to be a member of the Cabinet and was thus removed from the line of\nsuccession.[14]\n\n### Secretary of Homeland Security added\n2006[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Secretary of Homeland Security added 2006\")]\n\nThe [United States Department of Homeland\nSecurity](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security \"United States\nDepartment of Homeland Security\") was created in 2002. On March 9, 2006,\npursuant to the renewal of the Patriot Act as [Pub.L.\n109–177](http://legislink.org/us/pl-109-177), the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity was added to the line of succession. The order of Cabinet members in\nthe line has always been the same as the order in which their respective\ndepartments were established. Despite custom, many in Congress had wanted the\nSecretary to be placed at number eight on the list – below the Attorney\nGeneral, above the Secretary of the Interior, and in the position held by the\nSecretary of the Navy prior to the creation of the Secretary of Defense –\nbecause the Secretary, already in charge of disaster relief and security,\nwould presumably be more prepared to take over the presidency than some of the\nother Cabinet secretaries.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Despite this, the 2006 law explicitly specifies\nthat the \"Secretary of Homeland Security\" follows the \"Secretary of Veterans\nAffairs\" in the succession, effectively at the end of the list.[15]\n\n## Successions beyond Vice\nPresident[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Successions beyond Vice President\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Atchison_David_Rice_-\n_Plattsburg_MO_3.jpg/275px-Atchison_David_Rice_-\n_Plattsburg_MO_3.jpg)](/wiki/File:Atchison_David_Rice_-_Plattsburg_MO_3.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Atchison_David_Rice_-_Plattsburg_MO_3.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[David Rice Atchison](/wiki/David_Rice_Atchison \"David Rice Atchison\")'s\ntombstone (Plattsburg, Missouri), including the claim \"President of the United\nStates for One Day\"\n\nWhile nine Vice Presidents have succeeded to the office upon the death or\nresignation of the President, and two Vice Presidents have temporarily served\nas acting President, no other officer has ever been called upon to act as\nPresident. On March 4, 1849, President [Zachary Taylor](/wiki/Zachary_Taylor\n\"Zachary Taylor\")'s term began, but he declined to be sworn in on a Sunday,\nciting religious beliefs, and the Vice President was not sworn either. As the\nlast President _pro tempore_ of the Senate, [David Rice\nAtchison](/wiki/David_Rice_Atchison \"David Rice Atchison\") was thought by some\nto be next in line after the Vice President, and his tombstone claims that he\nwas US President for the day. However, Atchison took no oath of office to the\npresidency either, and his term as Senate President _pro tempore_ had by then\nexpired.[16][17]\n\nIn 1865, when [Andrew Johnson](/wiki/Andrew_Johnson \"Andrew Johnson\") assumed\nthe Presidency on the death of [Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\n\"Abraham Lincoln\"), the office of Vice President became vacant. At that time,\nthe Senate President pro tempore was next in line to the presidency. In 1868,\n[Johnson was impeached](/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson \"Impeachment of\nAndrew Johnson\") by the House of Representatives and subjected to trial in the\nSenate, and if he had been convicted and thereby removed from office, Senate\nPresident pro tempore [Benjamin Wade](/wiki/Benjamin_Wade \"Benjamin Wade\")\nwould have become acting President. This posed a conflict of interest, as\nWade's \"guilty\" vote could have been decisive in removing Johnson from office\nand giving himself presidential powers and duties. (Johnson was acquitted by a\none-vote margin.)\n\nIn his book _The Shadow Presidents,_ which he published in 1979, [Michael\nMedved](/wiki/Michael_Medved \"Michael Medved\") describes a situation that\narose prior to the [1916\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1916 \"United States\npresidential election, 1916\"), when the [First World War](/wiki/World_War_I\n\"World War I\") was raging in Europe. In view of the contemporary international\nturmoil, [President Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson \"Woodrow Wilson\")\nthought that if he lost the election it would be better for his opponent to\nbegin his administration straight away, instead of waiting through the [lame\nduck](/wiki/Lame_duck_\\(politics\\)#United_States \"Lame duck \\(politics\\)\")\nperiod, which at that time had a duration of almost four months. President\nWilson and his aides formed a plan to exploit the rule of succession so that\nhis rival [Charles Evans Hughes](/wiki/Charles_Evans_Hughes \"Charles Evans\nHughes\") could take over the Presidency as soon as the result of the election\nwas clear. The plan was that Wilson would appoint Hughes to the post of\n[Secretary of State](/wiki/U.S._Secretary_of_State \"U.S. Secretary of State\").\nWilson and his Vice President [Thomas R. Marshall](/wiki/Thomas_R._Marshall\n\"Thomas R. Marshall\") would then resign, and as the Secretary of State was at\nthat time designated next in line of succession, Hughes would become President\nimmediately. As it happened, President Wilson won re-election, so the plan was\nnever put into action.[18]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Ford_sworn-\nin.jpg/275px-Ford_sworn-in.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ford_sworn-in.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ford_sworn-in.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNew President [Gerald Ford](/wiki/Gerald_Ford \"Gerald Ford\") is sworn in\nfollowing the resignation of [Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard\nNixon\") on August 9, 1974.\n\nSince the 25th Amendment's ratification, its [Second Section](/wiki/Twenty-\nfifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_2:_Vice_Presidential_vacancy\n\"Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), which addresses\nVice Presidential succession as noted above, has been invoked twice.\n\nDuring the [1973 Vice Presidential\nvacancy](/wiki/Spiro_Agnew#Criminal_investigation_and_resignation \"Spiro\nAgnew\"), [House\nSpeaker](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Speaker\nof the United States House of Representatives\") [Carl\nAlbert](/wiki/Carl_Albert \"Carl Albert\") was first in line. As the [Watergate\nscandal](/wiki/Watergate_scandal \"Watergate scandal\") made President Nixon's\nremoval or resignation possible, Albert would have become [Acting\nPresident](/wiki/Acting_President_of_the_United_States \"Acting President of\nthe United States\") and—under Title 3, Section 19(c) of the [U.S.\nCode](/wiki/United_States_Code \"United States Code\")—would have been able to\n\"act as President until the expiration of the then current Presidential term\"\non January 20, 1977. Albert openly questioned whether it was appropriate for\nhim, a [Democrat](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party\n\\(United States\\)\"), to assume the powers and duties of the presidency when\nthere was a public [mandate](/wiki/Mandate_\\(politics\\) \"Mandate\n\\(politics\\)\") for the Presidency to be held by a\n[Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party\n\\(United States\\)\"). Albert announced that should he need to assume the\nPresidential powers and duties, he would do so only as a\n[caretaker](/wiki/Caretaker_government \"Caretaker government\"). However, with\nthe nomination and confirmation of [Gerald Ford](/wiki/Gerald_Ford \"Gerald\nFord\") to the Vice Presidency, which marked the first time the [Second\nSection](/wiki/Twenty-\nfifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_2:_Vice_Presidential_vacancy\n\"Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") of the Twenty-\nfifth Amendment was invoked, these series of events were never tested. Albert\nagain became first-in-line during the first four months of Ford's Presidency,\nbefore the confirmation of Vice President [Nelson\nRockefeller](/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller \"Nelson Rockefeller\"),[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] which\nmarked the second time Section 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment was invoked.\n\nIn 1981, when [President Ronald Reagan was\nshot](/wiki/Reagan_assassination_attempt \"Reagan assassination attempt\"), Vice\nPresident [George H. W. Bush](/wiki/George_H._W._Bush \"George H. W. Bush\") was\ntraveling in Texas. Secretary of State [Alexander Haig](/wiki/Alexander_Haig\n\"Alexander Haig\") responded to a reporter's question regarding who was running\nthe government by stating:\n\n> Constitutionally, gentlemen, you have the President, the Vice President and\n> the Secretary of State in that order, and should the President decide he\n> wants to transfer the helm to the Vice President, he will do so. He has not\n> done that. As of now, I am in control here, in the White House, pending\n> return of the Vice President and in close touch with him. If something came\n> up, I would check with him, of course.[19]\n\nA bitter dispute ensued over the meaning of Haig's remarks. Most people\nbelieved that Haig was referring to the line of succession and erroneously\nclaimed to have temporary Presidential authority, due to his implied reference\nto the Constitution. Haig and his supporters, noting his familiarity with the\nline of succession from his time as [White House Chief of\nStaff](/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff \"White House Chief of Staff\") during\n[Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\")'s resignation, said he\nonly meant that he was the highest-ranking officer of the [Executive\nbranch](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States#Executive_branch\n\"Federal government of the United States\") on-site, managing things\ntemporarily until the Vice President returned to\n[Washington](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Constitutional\nconcerns[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Constitutional concerns\")]\n\nSeveral constitutional law experts have raised questions as to the\nconstitutionality of the provisions that the Speaker of the House and the\nPresident pro tempore of the Senate succeed to the presidency.[20] [James\nMadison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\"), one of the authors of the\nConstitution, raised similar constitutional questions about the [Presidential\nSuccession Act of\n1792](/wiki/Presidential_Succession_Act#After_the_Presidential_Succession_Act_of_1792\n\"Presidential Succession Act\") in a 1792 letter to [Edmund\nPendleton](/wiki/Edmund_Pendleton \"Edmund Pendleton\").[21] Two of these issues\ncan be summarized:\n\n  * The term \"Officer\" in the relevant clause of the Constitution is most plausibly interpreted to mean an \"[Officer of the United States](/wiki/Officer_of_the_United_States \"Officer of the United States\")\", who must be a member of the Executive or Judicial Branch. The Speaker and the President pro tempore are not officers in this sense.\n  * Under the principle of separation of powers, the Constitution specifically disallows legislative officials from also serving in the executive branch. For the Speaker or the Senate President pro tempore to become Acting President, they must resign their position, at which point they are no longer in the line of succession. This is seen by some to form a constitutional [paradox](/wiki/Paradox \"Paradox\"). However, the current Act specifies that the Speaker becomes President \"upon his resignation as Speaker\" and as a member of Congress,[22] allowing for a seamless transition.\n\nIn 2003 the [Continuity of Government\nCommission](/wiki/Continuity_of_Government_Commission \"Continuity of\nGovernment Commission\") suggested that the current law has \"at least seven\nsignificant issues ... that warrant attention\", specifically:[23]\n\n  1. The reality that all figures in the current line of succession work and reside in the vicinity of Washington, D.C. In the event of a nuclear, chemical, or biological attack, it is possible that everyone on the list would be killed or incapacitated.\n  2. Doubt (such as those expressed above by James Madison) that congressional leaders are eligible to act as President.\n  3. A concern about the wisdom of including the President pro tempore in the line of succession as the \"largely honorific post traditionally held by the longest-serving Senator of the majority party\". For example, from January 20, 2001, to June 6, 2001, the President pro tempore was then-98-year-old [Strom Thurmond](/wiki/Strom_Thurmond \"Strom Thurmond\") of [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\").\n  4. A concern that the current line of succession can force the presidency to abruptly switch parties mid-term, as the President, Speaker, and the President pro tempore are not necessarily of the same party as each other.\n  5. A concern that the succession line is ordered by the dates of creation of the various executive departments, without regard to the skills or capacities of the persons serving as their Secretary.\n  6. The fact that, should a [Cabinet](/wiki/United_States_Cabinet \"United States Cabinet\") member begin to act as President, the law allows the [House](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States House of Representatives\") to elect a new Speaker (or the [Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\"), a new President pro tempore), who could in effect remove the Cabinet member and assume the office themselves at any time.\n  7. The absence of a provision where a President is disabled and the vice presidency is vacant (for example, if an assassination attempt simultaneously wounded the President and killed the Vice President).\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Central Locator System](/wiki/Central_Locator_System \"Central Locator System\")\n  * [Designated survivor](/wiki/Designated_survivor \"Designated survivor\")\n  * [List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots](/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_assassination_attempts_and_plots \"List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots\")\n  * [United States presidential line of succession in fiction](/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession_in_fiction \"United States presidential line of succession in fiction\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_line_of_succession&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [3 U.S.C.](/wiki/Title_3_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 3 of the United States Code\") [§ 19](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19)\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Is the Presidential Succession Law Constitutional?\"](http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/991/), [Akhil Reed Amar](/wiki/Akhil_Reed_Amar \"Akhil Reed Amar\"), Stanford Law Review, November 1995.\n  3. **Jump up ^** [First Report](https://web.archive.org/web/20080625015852/http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/FirstReport.pdf) p. 4, continuityofgovernment.org Retrieved December 28, 2010 via Internet Archive to repair dead link\n  4. **Jump up ^** Wilson, Reid (October 20, 2013).
