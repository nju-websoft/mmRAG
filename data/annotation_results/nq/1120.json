In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-\ntime Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of _Wisden Cricketers '\nAlmanack_.[8][9][10]\n\nTendulkar received the [Arjuna Award](/wiki/Arjuna_Award \"Arjuna Award\") in\n1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the [Rajiv Gandhi Khel\nRatna](/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_Khel_Ratna \"Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna\") award in 1997,\nIndia's highest sporting honour, and the [Padma Shri](/wiki/Padma_Shri \"Padma\nShri\") and [Padma Vibhushan](/wiki/Padma_Vibhushan \"Padma Vibhushan\") awards\nin 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian\nawards.[11] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the\n[Prime Minister's Office](/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Office_\\(India\\) \"Prime\nMinister's Office \\(India\\)\") announced the decision to award him the [Bharat\nRatna](/wiki/Bharat_Ratna \"Bharat Ratna\"), India's highest civilian\naward.[12][13] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever\nsportsperson to receive the award.[14][15] He also won the 2010 [Sir Garfield\nSobers Trophy](/wiki/Sir_Garfield_Sobers_Trophy \"Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy\")\nfor cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[16] In 2012, Tendulkar was\nnominated to the [Rajya Sabha](/wiki/Rajya_Sabha \"Rajya Sabha\"), the upper\nhouse of the [Parliament of India](/wiki/Parliament_of_India \"Parliament of\nIndia\").[17] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without\nan aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of [group\ncaptain](/wiki/Group_captain \"Group captain\") by the [Indian Air\nForce](/wiki/Indian_Air_Force \"Indian Air Force\").[18] In 2012, he was named\nan Honorary [Member of the Order of\nAustralia](/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia \"Member of the Order of\nAustralia\").[19][20]\n\nIn December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[21] He retired\nfrom Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[22] and subsequently retired from all\nforms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his [200th Test\nmatch](/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team_in_India_in_2013%E2%80%9314#Second_Test\n\"West Indian cricket team in India in 2013–14\"), against the [West\nIndies](/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team \"West Indies cricket team\") in Mumbai's\n[Wankhede Stadium](/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium \"Wankhede Stadium\").[23] Tendulkar\nplayed 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Early years\n  * 2 Early domestic career\n    * 2.1 Yorkshire\n  * 3 International career\n    * 3.1 Early career\n    * 3.2 Rise through the ranks\n    * 3.3 Captaincy\n    * 3.4 Mike Denness incident\n    * 3.5 Injuries and decline amid surpassing Bradman's haul\n    * 3.6 Decline phase of career\n    * 3.7 2003 Cricket World Cup\n    * 3.8 2003 Tour of Australia\n    * 3.9 2007 Cricket World Cup\n    * 3.10 Return to old form and consistency\n    * 3.11 2007–08 tour of Australia\n    * 3.12 Home series against South Africa\n    * 3.13 Sri Lanka Series\n    * 3.14 Return to form and breaking Brian Lara's record\n    * 3.15 ODI and Test Series against England\n    * 3.16 2009–2010\n    * 3.17 2011 World Cup and after\n      * 3.17.1 100th international century\n      * 3.17.2 Return To Ranji Trophy\n    * 3.18 Retirement\n  * 4 Indian Premier League and Champions League\n  * 5 Playing style\n  * 6 Fan following\n  * 7 Achievements and awards\n    * 7.1 National honours\n    * 7.2 Other honours\n  * 8 Personal life\n    * 8.1 Family\n    * 8.2 Beliefs\n    * 8.3 Business interests\n    * 8.4 Commercial endorsements\n    * 8.5 Rajya Sabha nomination\n    * 8.6 Philanthropy\n    * 8.7 Autobiography\n  * 9 Biographies\n    * 9.1 Books\n    * 9.2 Films\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 Notes\n  * 12 References\n  * 13 External links\n\n## Early years\n\nTendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in [Dadar](/wiki/Dadar \"Dadar\"),\n[Bombay](/wiki/Mumbai \"Mumbai\") on 24 April 1973.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] His\nfather, [Ramesh Tendulkar](/wiki/Ramesh_Tendulkar \"Ramesh Tendulkar\"), was a\nwell-known [Marathi](/wiki/Marathi_language \"Marathi language\") novelist and\nhis mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[24] Ramesh named\nTendulkar after his favourite music director, [Sachin Dev\nBurman](/wiki/Sachin_Dev_Burman \"Sachin Dev Burman\"). Tendulkar has three\nelder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita.\nThey were Ramesh's children from his first marriage.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nTendulkar played as a youngster with his brother, Ajit, for Sahitya Sahawas\nsociety’s cricket team at Bandra East. Ajit is credited by Sachin for playing\na pivotal role in his life.[25] [Ramakant Achrekar](/wiki/Ramakant_Achrekar\n\"Ramakant Achrekar\") was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to\nshift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[1] a\nschool at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many\nnotable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education\nSociety's New English School in Bandra (East).[26] He was also coached under\nthe guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[27]\nTendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted,\nAchrekar would put a one-[rupee](/wiki/Indian_rupee \"Indian rupee\") coin on\nthe top of the [stumps](/wiki/Stumps \"Stumps\"), and the bowler who dismissed\nTendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without\ngetting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers\nthe 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[28] He moved\nin with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period,\ndue to his hectic schedule.[26]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Anjali-\nSachin.jpg/220px-Anjali-Sachin.jpg)](/wiki/File:Anjali-Sachin.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Anjali-Sachin.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSachin Tendulkar and his wife Anjali\n\nMeanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had\nbecome a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there\nwere suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin\nconsistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal\n(MGSM) Shield.[29] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket,\ninitially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club\ncricket tournament, the Kanga League,[26] and later went on to play for the\n[Cricket Club of India](/wiki/Cricket_Club_of_India \"Cricket Club of\nIndia\").[30] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the [MRF Pace\nFoundation](/wiki/MRF_Pace_Foundation \"MRF Pace Foundation\") in Madras (now\n[Chennai](/wiki/Chennai \"Chennai\")) to train as a [fast\nbowler](/wiki/Fast_bowler \"Fast bowler\"), but Australian fast bowler [Dennis\nLillee](/wiki/Dennis_Lillee \"Dennis Lillee\"), who took a world record 355 Test\nwickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting\ninstead.[31] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for [Imran\nKhan](/wiki/Imran_Khan \"Imran Khan\")'s side in an exhibition game at Brabourne\nStadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of [Cricket Club of\nIndia](/wiki/Cricket_Club_of_India \"Cricket Club of India\").[32] A couple of\nmonths later, former Indian batsman [Sunil Gavaskar](/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar\n\"Sunil Gavaskar\") gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him\nto not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's \"Best\njunior cricket award\" (He was 14 years that time). \"It was the greatest source\nof encouragement for me,\" Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after\nsurpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[33][34] Sachin served\nas a [ball boy](/wiki/Ball_boy \"Ball boy\") in the [1987 Cricket World\nCup](/wiki/1987_Cricket_World_Cup \"1987 Cricket World Cup\") when India played\nagainst England in the semifinal in Bombay.[35][36] In his season in 1988,\nTendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an\nunbroken 664-run [partnership](/wiki/Partnership_\\(cricket\\) \"Partnership\n\\(cricket\\)\") in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's\nHigh School in 1988 with his friend and teammate [Vinod\nKambli](/wiki/Vinod_Kambli \"Vinod Kambli\"), who would also go on to represent\nIndia. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of\nthe opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out)\nin this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[37] This\nwas a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken\nby two under-13 batsmen in a match held at [Hyderabad](/wiki/Hyderabad,_India\n\"Hyderabad, India\") in India.[38]\n\n## Early domestic career\n\nOn 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent\n[Bombay](/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team \"Mumbai cricket team\") in the [Ranji\nTrophy](/wiki/Ranji_Trophy \"Ranji Trophy\"), India's premier domestic [First-\nclass cricket](/wiki/First-class_cricket \"First-class cricket\") tournament,\nfor the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in\nany of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.[26] He\nnarrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired\nfrom all forms of cricket after the [1987 Cricket World\nCup](/wiki/1987_Cricket_World_Cup \"1987 Cricket World Cup\").[26] A year later,\non 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for\nBombay against [Gujarat](/wiki/Gujarat_cricket_team \"Gujarat cricket team\") at\nhome and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to\nscore a century on debut in first-class cricket.[39] He was handpicked to play\nfor the team by the then Bombay captain [Dilip\nVengsarkar](/wiki/Dilip_Vengsarkar \"Dilip Vengsarkar\") after watching him\neasily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, [Kapil\nDev](/wiki/Kapil_Dev \"Kapil Dev\"), in the [Wankhede\nStadium](/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium \"Wankhede Stadium\") nets,[1] where the [Indian\nteam](/wiki/India_national_cricket_team \"India national cricket team\") had\ncome to play against the touring [New Zealand\nteam](/wiki/New_Zealand_national_cricket_team \"New Zealand national cricket\nteam\"). He followed this by scoring a century in his first\n[Deodhar](/wiki/Deodhar_Trophy \"Deodhar Trophy\") and [Duleep\nTrophies](/wiki/Duleep_Trophy \"Duleep Trophy\"), which are also Indian domestic\ntournaments.[40]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Dnyaneshwar_Agashe_with_Sachin_Tendulkar.png/220px-\nDnyaneshwar_Agashe_with_Sachin_Tendulkar.png)](/wiki/File:Dnyaneshwar_Agashe_with_Sachin_Tendulkar.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dnyaneshwar_Agashe_with_Sachin_Tendulkar.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nTendulkar (left) with former [Vice president](/wiki/Vice_president \"Vice\npresident\") of [BCCI](/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India \"Board of\nControl for Cricket in India\"), late [Dnyaneshwar\nAgashe](/wiki/Dnyaneshwar_Agashe \"Dnyaneshwar Agashe\") (center) and [Sourav\nGanguly](/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly \"Sourav Ganguly\") (right)\n\nTendulkar finished the 1988–89 season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He\nscored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the sixth highest run-scorer\noverall[41] He also made an unbeaten century in the [Irani\nTrophy](/wiki/Irani_Trophy \"Irani Trophy\") match against\n[Delhi](/wiki/Delhi_cricket_team \"Delhi cricket team\") at the start of the\n1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.[42] Sachin was picked for a\nyoung Indian team to tour England twice, under the Star Cricket Club banner in\n1988 and 1989.[43] In the famous 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, in which\n[Haryana](/wiki/Haryana_cricket_team \"Haryana cricket team\") defeated Bombay\nby two runs after leading in the first innings, Tendulkar's 96 from 75\ndeliveries was a key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to\nchase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.[44]\n\nHis first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the\nvisiting Australian team at the [Brabourne Stadium](/wiki/Brabourne_Stadium\n\"Brabourne Stadium\") in 1998.[1][45] He is the only player to score a century\non debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji,\nIrani, and Duleep Trophies).[46] Another double century was an innings of 233*\nagainst [Tamil Nadu](/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_cricket_team \"Tamil Nadu cricket team\")\nin the semi-finals of the 2000 [Ranji Trophy](/wiki/Ranji_Trophy \"Ranji\nTrophy\"), which he regards as one of the best innings of his\ncareer.[47][48][49]\n\n### Yorkshire\n\nIn 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to\nrepresent [Yorkshire](/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club \"Yorkshire County\nCricket Club\"), which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected\nplayers even from other English counties.[1][Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as\na replacement for the injured\n[Australian](/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team \"Australia national cricket\nteam\") fast bowler [Craig McDermott](/wiki/Craig_McDermott \"Craig McDermott\"),\nTendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at\nan average of 46.52.[50]\n\n## International career\n\n### Early career\n\n[Raj Singh Dungarpur](/wiki/Raj_Singh_Dungarpur \"Raj Singh Dungarpur\") is\ncredited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of\n[Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team \"Pakistan national cricket\nteam\") in late 1989,[51] after one first class season.[52] The Indian\nselection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the [tour of\nthe West Indies](/wiki/Indian_cricket_team_in_West_Indies_in_1988%E2%80%9389\n\"Indian cricket team in West Indies in 1988–89\") held earlier that year, but\neventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the\ndominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar\nmade his [Test](/wiki/Test_cricket \"Test cricket\") debut against Pakistan in\n[Karachi in November\n1989](/wiki/Indian_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_1989%E2%80%9390 \"Indian cricket\nteam in Pakistan in 1989–90\") aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs,\nbeing bowled by [Waqar Younis](/wiki/Waqar_Younis \"Waqar Younis\"), who also\nmade his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows\nto his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[53] In the fourth and\nfinal Test in [Sialkot](/wiki/Sialkot \"Sialkot\"), he was hit on the nose by a\nbouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to\nbat even as he gushed blood from it.[54] In a 20-over exhibition game in\n[Peshawar](/wiki/Peshawar \"Peshawar\"), held in parallel with the bilateral\nseries, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he\nscored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner [Abdul\nQadir](/wiki/Abdul_Qadir_\\(cricketer\\) \"Abdul Qadir \\(cricketer\\)\").[55] This\nwas later called \"one of the best innings I have seen\" by the then Indian\ncaptain [Krishnamachari Srikkanth](/wiki/Krishnamachari_Srikkanth\n\"Krishnamachari Srikkanth\").[56] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of\n35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only\n[One Day International](/wiki/One_Day_International \"One Day International\")\n(ODI) he played.[57][58] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to\ndebut for India in [Tests](/wiki/Test_cricket \"Test cricket\") at the age of 16\nyears and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in\n[ODIs](/wiki/One_Day_International \"One Day International\") at the age of 16\nyears and 238 days.[59][60]\n\nThe series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs\nat an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second\nTest.[61] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he\nplayed, and scored 36 in the other.[62] On his next tour, a summer tour to\nEngland of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to\nscore a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at [Old\nTrafford](/wiki/Old_Trafford_\\(cricket_ground\\) \"Old Trafford \\(cricket\nground\\)\") in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved\nIndia from certain defeat in the match.[54] [Wisden](/wiki/Wisden \"Wisden\")\ndescribed his innings as \"a disciplined display of immense maturity\" and also\nwrote:[63]\n\n> He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was\n> wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes\n> in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side\n> shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to\n> control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen.\n\nTendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92\ntour of Australia held before the [1992 Cricket World\nCup](/wiki/1992_Cricket_World_Cup \"1992 Cricket World Cup\"), that included an\nunbeaten 148 in the third Test at [Sydney](/wiki/Sydney_Cricket_Ground \"Sydney\nCricket Ground\"), making him the youngest batsman to score a century in\nAustralia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at\n[Perth](/wiki/WACA_Ground \"WACA Ground\") against a pace attack comprising\n[Merv Hughes](/wiki/Merv_Hughes \"Merv Hughes\"), [Bruce Reid](/wiki/Bruce_Reid\n\"Bruce Reid\") and [Craig McDermott](/wiki/Craig_McDermott \"Craig McDermott\").\nHughes commented to [Allan Border](/wiki/Allan_Border \"Allan Border\") at the\ntime that \"This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB.\"[64]\n\n### Rise through the ranks\n\nTendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his\nphysical peak, in his early twenties. He opened the batting at\n[Auckland](/wiki/Auckland \"Auckland\") against New Zealand in 1994, making 82\nruns off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against\nAustralia in [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka \"Sri Lanka\") at\n[Colombo](/wiki/Colombo \"Colombo\").[65][66] It took him 78 ODIs to score his\nfirst century.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Sachin_at_the_other_end.jpg/220px-\nSachin_at_the_other_end.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sachin_at_the_other_end.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sachin_at_the_other_end.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTendulkar waits at the bowler's end.\n\nTendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the [1996\nWorld Cup](/wiki/1996_Cricket_World_Cup \"1996 Cricket World Cup\"), scoring two\ncenturies.[67] He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-\nfinal against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match\nreferee, [Clive Lloyd](/wiki/Clive_Lloyd \"Clive Lloyd\"), awarded Sri Lanka the\nmatch after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.[68]\n\nAfter the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at\n[Sharjah](/wiki/Sharjah_\\(city\\) \"Sharjah \\(city\\)\"), Indian captain [Mohammed\nAzharuddin](/wiki/Mohammed_Azharuddin \"Mohammed Azharuddin\") was going through\na lean patch. Tendulkar and [Navjot Singh Sidhu](/wiki/Navjot_Singh_Sidhu\n\"Navjot Singh Sidhu\") both made centuries to set a then record partnership for\nthe second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds\nabout whether he should bat.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nTendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24\nruns off one over.[69] India went on to win that match. It enabled India to\npost a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.[70]\n\nThis was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world,\nculminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar\nscoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between\nTendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and [Shane\nWarne](/wiki/Shane_Warne \"Shane Warne\"), the world's leading spinner, both at\nthe peak of their careers, clashing in a Test series.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In the\nlead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with [Laxman\nSivaramakrishnan](/wiki/Laxman_Sivaramakrishnan \"Laxman Sivaramakrishnan\"),\nthe former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\ntheir tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the\n[Brabourne Stadium](/wiki/Brabourne_Stadium \"Brabourne Stadium\") in a three-\nday first class match.[71] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne\nconceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three\ndays.[72][73] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in\nIndia following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in\n[Kochi](/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_Stadium,_Kochi \"Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium,\nKochi\"). Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st\nover when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of [Michael\nBevan](/wiki/Michael_Bevan \"Michael Bevan\"), [Steve Waugh](/wiki/Steve_Waugh\n\"Steve Waugh\"), [Darren Lehmann](/wiki/Darren_Lehmann \"Darren Lehmann\"), [Tom\nMoody](/wiki/Tom_Moody \"Tom Moody\") and [Damien Martyn](/wiki/Damien_Martyn\n\"Damien Martyn\") for 32 runs in 10 overs.[74] The Test match success was\nfollowed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket\n[tournament](/wiki/1998_Coca-Cola_Cup \"1998 Coca-Cola Cup\") in Sharjah – the\nfirst in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the\nfinals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the\n[Desert Storm](/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_Coca-Cola_Cup \"1997–98 Coca-Cola Cup\")\ninnings.[75] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having\nnightmares about his Indian nemesis.[76]\n\nTendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at [Dhaka](/wiki/Dhaka\n\"Dhaka\") paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took\nfour Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[77]\n\nThe inaugural [Asian Test Championship](/wiki/Asian_Test_Championship \"Asian\nTest Championship\") took place in [February and March\n1999](/wiki/1998%E2%80%9399_Asian_Test_Championship \"1998–99 Asian Test\nChampionship\"), involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[78] In the first\nmatch, between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was run out for\nnine after colliding with Pakistan bowler [Shoaib Akhtar](/wiki/Shoaib_Akhtar\n\"Shoaib Akhtar\"). Around 100,000 people came to support India during the\ninitial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for\naggregate Test attendance record.[79] The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's\ndismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the\nfield. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed\nto the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in\nfront of a crowd of 200 people.[80] Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in\nthe second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.[81] India did\nnot progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to\nparticipate the next time the championship was held due to increasing\npolitical tensions between India and Pakistan.[82]\n\nIn the Test against Pakistan at [Chepauk](/wiki/Chepauk \"Chepauk\") in 1999,\nthe first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with\nIndia chasing 271 for victory. However, he was out when India needed 17 more\nruns to win, triggering a batting collapse, and India lost the match by 12\nruns.[83] The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, Sachin's\nfather, died in the middle of the [1999 Cricket World\nCup](/wiki/1999_Cricket_World_Cup \"1999 Cricket World Cup\"). Tendulkar flew\nback to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match\nagainst [Zimbabwe](/wiki/Zimbabwe \"Zimbabwe\").[84] However, he returned to the\nWorld Cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match\nagainst [Kenya](/wiki/Kenya_national_cricket_team \"Kenya national cricket\nteam\") in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.[85]\n\n### Captaincy\n\n**Tendulkar 's record as captain**  \n---  \n| Matches | Won | Lost | Drawn | Tied | No result | Win %  \nTest[86] | 25 | 4 | 9 | 12 | 0 | – | 16%  \nODI[87] | 73 | 23 | 43 | – | 2 | 6 | 31.50%  \n  \nTendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very\nsuccessful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge\nhopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly.\n[Azharuddin](/wiki/Mohammad_Azharuddin \"Mohammad Azharuddin\") was credited\nwith saying _\" Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!\"_,[88]\nwhich translates into: \"He won't win! It's not in the small one's\ndestiny!\".[89]\n\nTendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on\na tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned\nworld champions.[90] Tendulkar, however, won the player of the series\naward[90] as well as player of the match in one of the games.[91] After\nanother Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South\nAfrica, Tendulkar resigned, and [Sourav Ganguly](/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly \"Sourav\nGanguly\") took over as captain in 2000.[92][93]\n\nDuring the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, the desire of [Rahul\nDravid](/wiki/Rahul_Dravid \"Rahul Dravid\") to resign from the captaincy became\nknown. The BCCI President [Sharad Pawar](/wiki/Sharad_Pawar \"Sharad Pawar\")\noffered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended [Mahendra Singh\nDhoni](/wiki/Mahendra_Singh_Dhoni \"Mahendra Singh Dhoni\") to take over the\nreins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first\nforwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[94]\n\n### Mike Denness incident\n\nMain article: [Mike Denness and Indian cricket team\nincident](/wiki/Mike_Denness_and_Indian_cricket_team_incident \"Mike Denness\nand Indian cricket team incident\")\n\nIn India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second [test\nmatch](/wiki/Test_Cricket \"Test Cricket\") between\n[India](/wiki/Indian_cricket_team \"Indian cricket team\") and [South\nAfrica](/wiki/South_African_cricket_team \"South African cricket team\") at [St\nGeorge's Park](/wiki/Sahara_Oval_St_George%27s \"Sahara Oval St George's\"),\n[Port Elizabeth](/wiki/Port_Elizabeth \"Port Elizabeth\"), match referee [Mike\nDenness](/wiki/Mike_Denness \"Mike Denness\") fined four Indian players for\nexcessive appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain [Sourav\nGanguly](/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly \"Sourav Ganguly\") for not controlling his\nteam.[95] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light\nof alleged [ball tampering](/wiki/Ball_tampering \"Ball tampering\"). Television\ncameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in\ncleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[96] This can, under some conditions,\namount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar\nguilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one Test match ban.[97] The\nincident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of\nracism,[98] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the\nthird Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the\nteams rejected the appointed referee.[99] The charges against Tendulkar and\nSehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the\nIndian public.[100]\n\n### Injuries and decline amid surpassing Bradman's haul\n\nSachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002,\nwith some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three\nwickets on the final day of the famous [Kolkata Test against Australia in\n2001](/wiki/Second_Test,_2000%E2%80%9301_Border%E2%80%93Gavaskar_Trophy\n\"Second Test, 2000–01 Border–Gavaskar Trophy\"). Tendulkar took the key wickets\nof [Matthew Hayden](/wiki/Matthew_Hayden \"Matthew Hayden\") and [Adam\nGilchrist](/wiki/Adam_Gilchrist \"Adam Gilchrist\"), who were centurions in the\nprevious Test.He also take a wicket of [Shane Warne](/wiki/Shane_Warne \"Shane\nWarne\").This three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of\nIndia.[101] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th\nwicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain [Steve\nWaugh](/wiki/Steve_Waugh \"Steve Waugh\") in the final match at the [Fatorda\nStadium](/wiki/Fatorda_Stadium \"Fatorda Stadium\") in [Goa](/wiki/Goa\n\"Goa\").[102]\n\nIn the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in\nthe first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored\n117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to\nequal Sir [Donald Bradman](/wiki/Donald_Bradman \"Donald Bradman\")'s record of\n29 Test hundreds.He was awarded by Sports car \"[Ferrari](/wiki/Ferrari\n\"Ferrari\")\" by [Michael Schumacher](/wiki/Michael_Schumacher \"Michael\nSchumacher\") for achieving this feat.[103][104][105]\n\n### Decline phase of career\n\nThen, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the\nnext four innings.[106] He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and\n86, one half century. However, India lost the series.[107] In this period, in\nthe third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin scored his 30th\nTest century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match.[108][109]\n\n### 2003 Cricket World Cup\n\nTendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the [2003 Cricket World\nCup](/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup \"2003 Cricket World Cup\"),[110] helping\nIndia reach the final. While Australia retained the trophy that they had won\nin 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.[111][112]\n\nHe continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a\ntri-series involving New Zealand and Australia.[113][114] As a part-time\nbowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series\nfinal.[115]\n\n### 2003 Tour of Australia\n\nThe drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his\nmark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four\nat strike rate of 55.27 in [Sydney](/wiki/Sydney_Cricket_Ground \"Sydney\nCricket Ground\"), putting India in a virtually unbeatable position.He spend\n613 minut at crease.India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up\nthe innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test.[116] Prior\nto this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in\nall six innings in the preceding three Tests.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] It was\nno aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of\n17.25 and just one fifty.[117][_[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS\n\"Wikipedia:NOTRS\")_]\n\nTendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at [Multan](/wiki/Multan\n\"Multan\") in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before\nTendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he\nhad passed the landmark in Tests.[118] Tendulkar said that he was disappointed\nand that the declaration had taken him by surprise.[119] Many former\ncricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste.[120][121]\nAfter the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been\ndiscussed internally and put to rest.[122]\n\nA [tennis elbow](/wiki/Tennis_elbow \"Tennis elbow\") injury then took its toll\non Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back\nonly for the last two Tests when [Australia](/wiki/Australian_cricket_team\n\"Australian cricket team\") toured India in 2004.[123][124] He played a part in\nIndia's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took\nthe series 2–1.[125]\n\nOn 10 December 2005 at [Feroz Shah Kotla](/wiki/Feroz_Shah_Kotla \"Feroz Shah\nKotla\"), Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the\n[Sri Lankans](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team \"Sri Lankan cricket team\"). After\nthis, Tendulkar endured the longest[_[needs\nupdate](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_] spell of his career without a\nTest century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in\nMay 2007.[126] Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a\nmatch against Pakistan.[127] He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day\nInternational against Pakistan on 11 February 2006,[128] and then a 95 in\nhostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an\nIndian victory.[129] On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run\nagainst [England](/wiki/English_cricket_team \"English cricket team\") in the\nfirst innings of the third Test in his home ground,\n[Wankhede](/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium \"Wankhede Stadium\"), Tendulkar was booed off\nthe ground by a section of the crowd,[130] the first time that he had ever\nfaced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century\nto his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions\nabout his longevity.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nTendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia\n\"Malaysia\") and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback\nmatch, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his\ncritics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI\ncentury.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won\nthe rain-affected match by the [D/L method](/wiki/Duckworth-Lewis_method\n\"Duckworth-Lewis method\").[131]\n\n### 2007 Cricket World Cup\n\nDuring the preparation for the [2007 World Cup](/wiki/2007_Cricket_World_Cup\n\"2007 Cricket World Cup\"), Tendulkar's attitude was criticised by Indian team\ncoach [Greg Chappell](/wiki/Greg_Chappell \"Greg Chappell\"). Chappell\nreportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the\nlatter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had\nplayed for most of his career.[132] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's\nrepeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion,\nTendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that\nno coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7\nApril 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to\nTendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[133]\nChappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no\nbearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[132]\n\nAt the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led\nby Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign.

He also reached the 12,000 run\nmark when he was on 61.[163][164] He described the achievement as the biggest\nin 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record.[165] He made a\nfifty in the third Test[166] and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series\n2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[167]\n\n### ODI and Test Series against England\n\nTendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at\nhome against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI[168]\nand 50 in the fifth,[169] before the series was called off due to the [2008\nMumbai terrorist attacks](/wiki/2008_Mumbai_terrorist_attacks \"2008 Mumbai\nterrorist attacks\"), the scoreline being 5–0 to India.[170][171]\n\nEngland returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first\nTest, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to\nChennai following the terror attacks.[170][171] Chasing 387 for victory in\nthat match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth\nwicket partnership with [Yuvraj Singh](/wiki/Yuvraj_Singh \"Yuvraj\nSingh\").[172] This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test\nmatch, and the first which resulted in a win.[173] He dedicated this century\nto the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks.[174] Tendulkar scored poorly in\nthe second Test at [Mohali](/wiki/Mohali \"Mohali\"), which ended in a draw.\nIndia won the series 1–0.[175]\n\n### 2009–2010\n\nSee also: [List of highest individual scores in\nODIs](/wiki/List_of_highest_individual_scores_in_ODIs \"List of highest\nindividual scores in ODIs\")\n\nIn early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series\nhad been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks\nin Mumbai.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three\nmatches, being dismissed [leg before wicket](/wiki/Leg_before_wicket \"Leg\nbefore wicket\") in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two\nmatches.[176]\n\nIndia's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of\nthree Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163\nin the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India\nmade 392, won the match[177] and eventually won the series 3–1.[178] Tendulkar\nmade 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won.[179] He made\n49 and 64 in the second Test[180] and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was\nhalted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win.\nIndia won the series 1–0.[181][182]\n\nTendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies,[183] but was back\nfor the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in\nearly September 2009. He made 46[184] and 27[185] in the league matches before\nnotching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs.[186] This\nwas Tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third\nconsecutive score of over 50 in such finals.[187]\n\nTendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa,\nscoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost.[188] The next match against\nAustralia was abandoned due to rain[189] and he was out with a stomach\ninfection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were\neliminated.[190]\n\nAustralia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and\nTendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games.[191] In the fifth\nmatch, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs.[192]\nTendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed\nthat he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a\nslower delivery from debutant bowler [Clint McKay](/wiki/Clint_McKay \"Clint\nMcKay\") over short fine leg only to be caught by [Nathan\nHauritz](/wiki/Nathan_Hauritz \"Nathan Hauritz\"), with India needing 19 runs to\nwin with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and\nAustralia won the match by three runs.[193][194] During this match, Tendulkar\nalso became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs,[194][195] and achieved\nhis personal best against Australia,[196] as well as the third highest score\nin a defeat.[197]\n\nIn the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored\n69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches,[198] with the fifth match\nbeing abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous.[199]\nIndia won the series 3–1.[200] In the Test series that followed, he scored a\n100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second\nand third Tests respectively as India clinched innings victories in both the\nTests, to win the series 2–0.[201]\n\nSachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played\nin the subsequent Test series.[202] He made 105 not out and 16 in the first\nTest, and 143 in the second.

It was also his fourth hundred in\nsuccessive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat.[206][207]\nIn the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not\nout, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in ODI\ncricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by\nPakistan's [Saeed Anwar](/wiki/Saeed_Anwar \"Saeed Anwar\") and Zimbabwe's\n[Charles Coventry](/wiki/Charles_Coventry_\\(Zimbabwean_cricketer\\) \"Charles\nCoventry \\(Zimbabwean cricketer\\)\").[Note 2]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Tendulkar_goes_to_14%2C000_Test_runs.jpg/600px-\nTendulkar_goes_to_14%2C000_Test_runs.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tendulkar_goes_to_14,000_Test_runs.jpg\n\"Tendulkar's shot to reach 14,000 Test runs.

However his highest score in the Tests was 91;\nTendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed\nIndia as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[221][222] The injury Tendulkar sustained\nto his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the\nODI series that followed.[221] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November\n2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket,\nduring the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla\nStadium in New Delhi.[223][224]\n\n[Ian Chappell](/wiki/Ian_Chappell \"Ian Chappell\") was not happy with Sachin's\nperformance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's quest for\nhis 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has\nhampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[225] Former India World\nCup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that\nSachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Former\nAustralian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to\ndecide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for\ntoo long.[226] The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in\nthe national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing\nin August 2012.[227]\n\n#### 100th international century\n\nTendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur\nagainst Bangladesh in the Asia Cup.[228] He became the first person in history\nto achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh.\nHe said \"It's been a tough phase for me ... I was not thinking about the\nmilestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room\nservice, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my\n99 hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99\nhundreds.\"[229] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match\nagainst Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.[230]\n\n#### Return To Ranji Trophy\n\nAfter being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and\nhitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back\nsome form ahead of the England Series at home,[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] in a\nmatch for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji\nTrophy match since 2009.

A report by _[The Hindustan\nTimes](/wiki/The_Hindustan_Times \"The Hindustan Times\")_ said that Tendulkar\nhad a discussion with the national chief selector [Sandeep\nPatil](/wiki/Sandeep_Patil \"Sandeep Patil\"), in which he said that he would\nleave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any\nruns.[233] This speculation, however, was later considered to be\nfalse.[234][235]\n\nThen he decided to play in the knockout stage of the [2012-13 Ranji\nTrophy](/wiki/2012-13_Ranji_Trophy \"2012-13 Ranji Trophy\").

[Cricinfo](/wiki/Cricinfo \"Cricinfo\") columnist [Sambit\nBal](/wiki/Sambit_Bal \"Sambit Bal\") has described him as the \"most wholesome\nbatsman of his time\".[1] His batting is based on complete balance and poise\nwhile limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little\npreference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has\nscored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and\nAustralia.[1] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over\nsquare. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often\ncompleted with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his\nfavourite shot.[275] In 2008, [Sunil Gavaskar](/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar \"Sunil\nGavaskar\"), in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that \"it is hard to\nimagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique\nwith raw aggression like the little champion does\".[276]\n\n[Sir Donald Bradman](/wiki/Sir_Donald_Bradman \"Sir Donald Bradman\"),\nconsidered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar\nto have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that\n\"Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot\nproduction, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt\nthat Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did\nappear similar.\"[277][278]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Master_Blaster_at_work.jpg/220px-\nMaster_Blaster_at_work.jpg)](/wiki/File:Master_Blaster_at_work.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Master_Blaster_at_work.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTendulkar at the crease, getting ready to face a delivery\n\nFormer Australian cricket team coach [John\nBuchanan](/wiki/John_Buchanan_\\(cricketer,_born_1953\\) \"John Buchanan\n\\(cricketer, born 1953\\)\") voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become\nsusceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of\nfootwork.[279] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing\nleft-arm pace.[279] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since\nthen Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this\nchange in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting\ndifferently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire\nlength of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now\nand thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was\na more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a\nball. [Ian Chappell](/wiki/Ian_Chappell \"Ian Chappell\"), former Australian\nplayer, remarked in 2007 that \"Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he\nwas when he was a young bloke\".[280]\n\nTendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his\nrepertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the\nslash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years.\nHe is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet\nkeep scoring consistently.[281]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Sachin_Tendulkar_bowling_right-\narm_leg-spin_26_January_2008.JPG/220px-Sachin_Tendulkar_bowling_right-arm_leg-\nspin_26_January_2008.JPG)](/wiki/File:Sachin_Tendulkar_bowling_right-arm_leg-\nspin_26_January_2008.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sachin_Tendulkar_bowling_right-arm_leg-spin_26_January_2008.JPG\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nTendulkar has taken 201 wickets across all three formats of the international\ngame.\n\nWhile Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl [medium\npace](/wiki/Medium_pace \"Medium pace\"), [leg spin](/wiki/Leg_spin \"Leg spin\"),\nand [off spin](/wiki/Off_spin \"Off spin\"). He often bowls when two batsmen of\nthe opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can\noften be a useful partnership breaker.[282] With his bowling, he has helped\nsecure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[283] He has taken 201\ninternational wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's tenth\nhighest wicket taker, and one wicket in [Twenty20\nInternationals](/wiki/Twenty20_International \"Twenty20 International\").[284]\n\n## Fan following\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/A_Cricket_fan_at_the_Chepauk_stadium%2C_Chennai.jpg/170px-\nA_Cricket_fan_at_the_Chepauk_stadium%2C_Chennai.jpg)](/wiki/File:A_Cricket_fan_at_the_Chepauk_stadium,_Chennai.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:A_Cricket_fan_at_the_Chepauk_stadium,_Chennai.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Sudhir Kumar Chaudhary](/wiki/Sudhir_Kumar_Chaudhary \"Sudhir Kumar\nChaudhary\"), a fan of Tendulkar who earned the privilege of tickets to all of\nIndia's home games\n\nTendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the\nglobe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently\nscored centuries.[64] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is \"Cricket\nis my religion and Sachin is my God\".[285] _[Cricinfo](/wiki/Cricinfo\n\"Cricinfo\")_ mentions in his profile that \"...
