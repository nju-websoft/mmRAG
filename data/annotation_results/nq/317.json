Calhoun](/wiki/John_C._Calhoun\n\"John C. Calhoun\") and [John Quincy Adams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John\nQuincy Adams\"). The System ran counter to [federalism](/wiki/Federalism\n\"Federalism\") and included:\n\n  * Support for a high [tariff](/wiki/Tariff \"Tariff\") to protect American industries and generate revenue for the [federal government](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal government of the United States\")\n  * Maintenance of high public land prices to generate [federal revenue](/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service \"Internal Revenue Service\")\n  * Preservation of the [Bank of the United States](/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States \"Second Bank of the United States\") to stabilize the currency and rein in risky state and local banks\n  * Development of a system of internal improvements (such as roads and canals) which would knit the nation together and be financed by the tariff and land sales\n\nClay protested that [the West](/wiki/Midwestern_United_States \"Midwestern\nUnited States\"), which opposed the tariff, should support it since urban\nfactory workers would be consumers of western foods. In Clay’s view, the South\n(which also opposed high tariffs) should support them because of the ready\nmarket for cotton in northern mills. This last argument was the weak link.\n[The South](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\") never\nstrongly supported the American System and had access to plenty of markets for\nits [cotton](/wiki/Cotton \"Cotton\") exports.\n\nPortions of the American System were enacted by the [United States\nCongress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\"). The [Second\nBank of the United States](/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States \"Second Bank\nof the United States\") was rechartered in 1816 for 20 years. High tariffs were\nfirst suggested by [Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander\nHamilton\") in his 1791 [Report on Manufactures](/wiki/Report_on_Manufactures\n\"Report on Manufactures\") but were not approved by Congress until the [Tariff\nof 1816](/wiki/Tariff_of_1816 \"Tariff of 1816\"). Tariffs were subsequently\nraised until they peaked in 1828 after the so-called [Tariff of\nAbominations](/wiki/Tariff_of_Abominations \"Tariff of Abominations\"). After\nthe [Nullification Crisis](/wiki/Nullification_Crisis \"Nullification Crisis\")\nin 1833, tariffs remained the same rate until the Civil War. However, the\nnational system of internal improvements was never adequately funded; the\nfailure to do so was due in part to sectional jealousies and constitutional\nsquabbles about such expenditures.\n\nThe American System did not enjoy universal success, however; in 1830,\nPresident Jackson vetoed a bill which would allow the federal government to\npurchase stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike\nRoad Company, which had been organized to construct a road linking Lexington\nand the Ohio River, the entirety of which would be in the state of Kentucky.\nJackson's [Maysville Road veto](/wiki/Maysville_Road_veto \"Maysville Road\nveto\") was due to both his personal conflict with Clay and his ideological\nobjections.\n\n## Main\npoints[[edit](/w/index.php?title=American_System_\\(economic_plan\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Main points\")]\n\nThe establishment of a protective tariff, a 20%–25% tax on imported goods,\nwould protect a nation’s business from foreign competition. Congress passed a\n[tariff in 1816](/wiki/Dallas_Tariff \"Dallas Tariff\") which made European\ngoods more expensive and encouraged consumers to buy relatively cheap\nAmerican-made goods.\n\nThe establishment of a [national bank](/wiki/National_bank \"National bank\")\nwould promote a single currency, making trade easier, and issue what was\ncalled _[sovereign credit](/wiki/Sovereign_credit \"Sovereign credit\")_ , i.e.,\ncredit issued by the national government, rather than borrowed from the\nprivate banking system. In 1816, Congress created the [Second Bank of the\nUnited States](/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States \"Second Bank of the\nUnited States\").\n\nThe improvement of the country’s [infrastructure](/wiki/Infrastructure\n\"Infrastructure\"), especially transportation systems, made trade easier and\nfaster for everyone. Poor roads made transportation slow and costly.\n\nThis program became the leading tenet of the [Whig\nParty](/wiki/Whig_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Whig Party \\(United States\\)\") of\nHenry Clay and [Daniel Webster](/wiki/Daniel_Webster \"Daniel Webster\"). It was\nopposed by the [Democratic\nParty](/wiki/History_of_the_Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"History of the\nDemocratic Party \\(United States\\)\") of [Andrew Jackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson\n\"Andrew Jackson\"), [Martin Van Buren](/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren \"Martin Van\nBuren\"), [James K. Polk](/wiki/James_K._Polk \"James K. Polk\"), [Franklin\nPierce](/wiki/Franklin_Pierce \"Franklin Pierce\"), and [James\nBuchanan](/wiki/James_Buchanan \"James Buchanan\") prior to the Civil War, often\non the grounds that the points of it were unconstitutional.\n\nAmong the most important internal improvements created under the American\nSystem was the [Cumberland Road](/wiki/Cumberland_Road \"Cumberland Road\").\n\n> Henry Clay's \"American System,\" devised in the burst of nationalism that\n> followed [the War of 1812](/wiki/The_War_of_1812 \"The War of 1812\"), remains\n> one of the most historically significant examples of a government-sponsored\n> program to harmonize and balance the nation's agriculture, commerce, and\n> industry. This \"System\" consisted of three mutually reenforcing parts: a\n> tariff to protect and promote American industry; a national bank to foster\n> commerce; and federal subsidies for roads, canals, and other \"internal\n> improvements\" to develop profitable markets for agriculture. Funds for these\n> subsidies would be obtained from tariffs and sales of public lands.
