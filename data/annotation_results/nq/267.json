The Brewers finished in\nfifth in the [NL Central](/wiki/National_League_Central \"National League\nCentral\"), 28 games behind the [Houston Astros](/wiki/Houston_Astros \"Houston\nAstros\"), with a record of 74 wins and 88 losses. Before the 1998 regular\nseason began, two new teams—the [Arizona\nDiamondbacks](/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks \"Arizona Diamondbacks\") and [Tampa\nBay Devil Rays](/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Devil_Rays \"Tampa Bay Devil Rays\")—were added\nby Major League Baseball. This resulted in the American League and National\nLeague having fifteen teams. However, in order for MLB officials to continue\nprimarily intraleague play, both leagues would need to carry a number of teams\nthat was divisible by two, so the decision was made to move one club from the\nAL Central to the NL Central.\n\nThis realignment was widely considered to have great financial benefit to the\nclub moving. However, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest,\nCommissioner (then club owner) Bud Selig decided another team should have the\nfirst chance to switch leagues. The choice was offered to the Kansas City\nRoyals, who ultimately decided to stay in the American League.[1] The choice\nthen fell to the Brewers, who, on November 6, 1997, elected to move to the\nNational League. Had the Brewers elected not to move to the National League,\nthe Minnesota Twins would have been offered the opportunity to switch\nleagues.[2]\n\nAlso, Milwaukee was not totally unfamiliar with the National League, having\nbeen the home of the NL [Braves](/wiki/Atlanta_Braves \"Atlanta Braves\") for 13\nseasons (1953–1965).\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Offseason\n  * 2 Regular season\n    *
