It was commissioned in 1984 to\nmanufacture wheels and axles for the Indian Railways.\n\nThis factory uses cast steel technology in the manufacturing of wheels which\nutilizes scrap steel collected from Railways' own workshops as raw material.\nThe products (Wheels, [Axles](/wiki/Axles \"Axles\") and wheel sets) are\nengineered with little scrap for human errors. It has a planned capacity to\nmanufacture of about 70,000 wheels of different sizes, 23,000 axles and to\nassemble 23,000 wheel sets. It employs over 2000 personnel and has an annual\nturnover of about 82 crores.
