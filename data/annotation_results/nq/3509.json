These lanes are usually marked with white\n[diamonds](/wiki/Rhombus \"Rhombus\") or [lozenge](/wiki/Lozenge \"Lozenge\"),\nhence their name. Diamond lanes are generally the right-most or left-most lane\non the road. They are usually implemented to provide ways through [traffic\ncongestion](/wiki/Traffic_congestion \"Traffic congestion\"), for safety\nreasons, and to encourage environmentally friendly transportation. A diamond\nlane may be intended for a specific type of traffic, or for several types. The\nintended use of a diamond lane is marked by [traffic\nsigns](/wiki/Traffic_signs \"Traffic signs\"). In most areas, violating the\nrules of a diamond lane is punishable by a [fine](/wiki/Fine_\\(penalty\\) \"Fine\n\\(penalty\\)\").\n\nSome common examples are:\n\n  * [High-occupancy vehicle lane](/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle_lane \"High-occupancy vehicle lane\") (HOV), also known as a carpool lane. These are typically [freeway](/wiki/Freeway \"Freeway\") lanes intended for multiple occupant or \"[green vehicles](/wiki/Green_vehicle \"Green vehicle\")\" (such as [hybrid](/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle \"Hybrid vehicle\") or [electric](/wiki/Electric_vehicle \"Electric vehicle\") cars).\n  * [Bike lane](/wiki/Bike_lane \"Bike lane\"), sometimes referred to as [segregated cycle facilities](/wiki/Segregated_cycle_facilities \"Segregated cycle facilities\"). Separating bicycle traffic from [pedestrian](/wiki/Pedestrian \"Pedestrian\") or [motor vehicle](/wiki/Motor_vehicle \"Motor vehicle\") traffic is typically safer and improves [traffic flow](/wiki/Traffic_flow \"Traffic flow\").\n  * [Bus lane](/wiki/Bus_lane \"Bus lane\"), an uncongested lane for buses to travel, load, or unload in.\n  * [Emergency vehicle](/wiki/Emergency_vehicle \"Emergency vehicle\") lane, to help emergency vehicles get to their destination as fast as possible while avoiding traffic congestion.\n  * [Taxicab](/wiki/Taxicab \"Taxicab\") lanes, most often found at [airports](/wiki/Airports \"Airports\") or other transit hubs for passenger loading and unloading.\n  * [Horse and buggy](/wiki/Horse_and_buggy \"Horse and buggy\") lanes in areas with significant [Amish](/wiki/Amish \"Amish\") populations\n\n## Standards[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Diamond_lane&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Standards\")]\n\nThe [U.S. Department of\nTransportation](/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Transportation \"U.S. Department of\nTransportation\")'s [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control\nDevices](/wiki/Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices \"Manual on Uniform\nTraffic Control Devices\") states that diamonds indicates a lane reserved for\nhigh-occupancy vehicles.
