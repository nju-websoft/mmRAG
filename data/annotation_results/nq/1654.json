It details what a [website](/wiki/Website\n\"Website\") operator must include in a [privacy policy](/wiki/Privacy_policy\n\"Privacy policy\"), when and how to seek verifiable consent from a\n[parent](/wiki/Parent \"Parent\") or [guardian](/wiki/Legal_guardian \"Legal\nguardian\"), and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children's\nprivacy and safety online including restrictions on the marketing of those\nunder 13.[1]\n\nWhile children under 13 can legally give out personal information with their\nparents' permission, many websites – particularly [social\nmedia](/wiki/Social_media \"Social media\") sites — disallow underage children\nfrom using their services altogether due to the cost and work involved in\ncomplying with the law.[2][3][4]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Violations\n  * 3 Compliance\n  * 4 International scope\n  * 5 Criticisms\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nIn 1990s, the electronic commerce was on its rise, but there have been\nexpressed various concerns about the data collection practices and the impact\nof Internet commerce on the user privacy - especially children, because very\nfew websites had their own privacy policies.[5] Center of Media Education has\npetitioned [Federal Trade Commission](/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission \"Federal\nTrade Commission\") (FTC) to investigate the data collection and use practices\nof the KidsCom.com website, and take legal action since the data practices\nviolated Section 5 of FTC Act concerning \"unfair/deceptive practices\". After\nFTC has completed the investigation, it issued the \"KidsCom Letter\" \\- the\nreport that the data collection and use practices were indeed subject to legal\naction.[6][7] This resulted in the need to inform parents about the risks of\nchildren's online privacy, as well as to parental consent necessity. This\nresulted in the drafting of COPPA.\n\nThe [Federal Trade Commission](/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission \"Federal Trade\nCommission\") (FTC) has the authority to issue regulations and enforce COPPA.\nAlso under the terms of COPPA, the FTC-designated \"safe harbor\" provisioning\nis designed to encourage increased industry self-regulation. Under this\nprovision, industry groups and others may request Commission approval of self-\nregulatory guidelines to govern participants' compliance, such that website\noperators in Commission-approved programs would first be subject to the\ndisciplinary procedures of the safe harbor program in lieu of FTC enforcement.\nAs of June\n2016,[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act&action=edit)\nthe FTC has approved seven safe harbor programs operated by\n[TRUSTe](/wiki/TRUSTe \"TRUSTe\"),\n[ESRB](/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board \"Entertainment Software\nRating Board\"), [CARU](/wiki/CARU \"CARU\"), [PRIVO](/wiki/PRIVO \"PRIVO\"),\n[Aristotle, Inc.](/wiki/Aristotle,_Inc. \"Aristotle, Inc.\"), Samet Privacy\n(kidSAFE), and the Internet Keep Safe Coalition (iKeepSafe).[8][9]\n\nIn September 2011, the FTC announced proposed revisions to the COPPA rules,\nthe first significant changes to the act since the issuance of the rules in\n2000. The proposed rule changes expanded the definition of what it meant to\n\"collect\" data from children. The proposed rules presented a [data\nretention](/wiki/Data_retention \"Data retention\") and deletion requirement,\nwhich mandated that data obtained from children be retained only for the\namount of time necessary to achieve the purpose that it was collected for. It\nalso added the requirement that operators ensure that any third parties to\nwhom a child's information is disclosed have reasonable procedures in place to\nprotect the information.[10]\n\nThe act applies to websites and online services operated for commercial\npurposes that are either directed towards children under 13 or have actual\nknowledge that children under 13 are providing information online. Most\nrecognized non-profit organizations are exempt from most of the requirements\nof COPPA.[1] However, the Supreme Court ruled that non-profits operated for\nthe benefit of their members' commercial activities are subject to FTC\nregulation and consequently COPPA as well.[11] The type of \"verifiable\nparental consent\" that is required before collecting and using information\nprovided by children under 13 is based upon a \"sliding scale\" set forth in a\n[Federal Trade Commission](/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission \"Federal Trade\nCommission\") regulation[12] that takes into account the manner in which the\ninformation is being collected and the uses to which the information will be\nput.\n\n##\nViolations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Violations\")]\n\nThe FTC has brought a number of actions against website operators for failure\nto comply with COPPA requirements, including actions against [Girls'\nLife](/wiki/Girls%27_Life_\\(magazine\\) \"Girls' Life \\(magazine\\)\"),[13]\n[American Pop Corn Company](/wiki/American_Pop_Corn_Company \"American Pop Corn\nCompany\"),[14] [Lisa Frank](/wiki/Lisa_Frank \"Lisa Frank\"), Inc.,[15] [Mrs.\nFields](/wiki/Mrs._Fields \"Mrs. Fields\") Cookies, and [The Hershey\nCompany](/wiki/The_Hershey_Company \"The Hershey Company\").[16]\n\nIn February 2004, UMG Recordings, Inc. was fined US$400,000 for COPPA\nviolations in connection with a web site that promoted the then 13-year-old\npop star [Lil' Romeo](/wiki/Romeo_Miller \"Romeo Miller\") and hosted child-\noriented games and activities, and Bonzi Software, which offered downloads of\nan animated figure \"[BonziBuddy](/wiki/BonziBuddy \"BonziBuddy\")\" that provided\nshopping advice, jokes, and trivia was fined US$75,000 for COPPA\nviolations.[17] Similarly, the owners of the [Xanga](/wiki/Xanga \"Xanga\")\nwebsite were fined [US$](/wiki/United_States_dollar \"United States dollar\")1\nmillion in 2006 for COPPA violations of repeatedly allowing children under 13\nto sign up for the service without getting their parent's consent.[18]\n\nIn 2016, the mobile advertising network, inMobi was fined US$950,000 for\ntracking all ages of users (13 and younger and older) geo-location\nunknowingly. The advertising software continuously tracked user location\ndespite privacy preferences on the mobile device.[19] Other websites that were\ndirected towards children and fined due to COPPA include Imbee (2008)[20]\nKidswirl (2011),[21] and Skid-e-Kids (2011).[22]\n\n##\nCompliance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Compliance\")]\n\nIn December 2012, the [Federal Trade\nCommission](/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission \"Federal Trade Commission\") issued\nrevisions effective July 1, 2013, which created additional parental notice and\nconsent requirements, amended definitions, and added other obligations for\norganizations that (1) operate a website or online service that is \"directed\nto children\" under 13 and that collects \"personal information\" from users or\n(2) knowingly collects personal information from persons under 13 through a\nwebsite or online service.[23] After July 1, 2013, operators must:[24]\n\n  * Post a clear and comprehensive online privacy policy describing their information practices for personal information collected online from persons under age 13;\n  * Make reasonable efforts (taking into account available technology) to provide direct notice to parents of the operator's practices with regard to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from persons under 13, including notice of any material change to such practices to which the parents has previously consented;\n  * Obtain verifiable parental consent, with limited exceptions, prior to any collection, use, and/or disclosure of personal information from persons under age 13;\n  * Provide a reasonable means for a parent to review the personal information collected from their child and to refuse to permit its further use or maintenance;\n  * Establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from children under age 13, including by taking reasonable steps to disclose/release such personal information only to parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security; and\n  * Retain personal information collected online from a child for only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and delete the information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.\n  * Operators are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an online activity on the child providing more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.[25]\n\nAccording to a notice issued by the [Federal Trade\nCommission](/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission \"Federal Trade Commission\") an\noperator has actual knowledge of a user's age if the site or service asks for\n– and receives – information from the user that allows it to determine the\nperson's age.[26] An example cited by the FTC includes, an operator who asks\nfor a date of birth on a site's registration page has actual knowledge as\ndefined by COPPA if a user responds with a year that suggests they're under\n13. Another example cited by the FTC that an operator may have actual\nknowledge based on answers to \"age identifying\" questions like \"What grade are\nyou in?\" or \"What type of school do you go to? (a) elementary; (b) middle; (c)\nhigh school; (d) college.\"\n\nA small fee is charged by Microsoft under COPPA as a way to verify parent\nconsent. The fee is donated to the National Center for Missing and Exploited\nChildren.[27] Google, however, charges the small fee as a way to verify one's\ndate of birth.\n\nIn the changes effective July 1, 2013, the definition of an operator was\nupdated to make clear that COPPA covers a child-directed site or service that\nintegrates outside services, such as plug-ins or advertising networks, that\ncollect personal information from its visitors.[28] The definition of a\nwebsite or online service directed to children is expanded to include plug-ins\nor ad networks that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal\ninformation through a child-directed website or online service. Websites and\nservices that target children as a secondary audience may differentiate among\nusers, and are required to provide notice and obtain parental consent only for\nthose users who identify themselves as being younger than 13.[23] The\ndefinition of personal information requiring parental notice and consent\nbefore collection now includes \"persistent identifiers\" that can be used to\nrecognize users over time and across different websites or online services.\nHowever, no parental notice and consent is required when an operator collects\na persistent identifier for the sole purpose of supporting the website or\nonline service's internal operations.[28] The definition of personal\ninformation after July 1, 2013, also includes geolocation information, as well\nas photos, videos, and audio files that contain a child's image or voice.[24]\n\nOn November 19, 2015, the FTC announced it had approved an additional method\nfor obtaining verifiable parental consent: \"face match to verified photo\nidentification\" (FMVPI). The two-step process allows a parent to submit a\ngovernment-sanctioned ID for authentication, then submit an impromptu photo\nvia mobile device or web camera, which is then compared to the photo on the\nID.[29]\n\n## International\nscope[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: International scope\")]\n\nWhile COPPA is an American law, the [Federal Trade\nCommission](/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission \"Federal Trade Commission\") has\nmade it clear that the requirements of COPPA will apply to foreign-operated\nweb sites if such sites \"are directed to children in the U.S. or knowingly\ncollect information from children in the U.S.\"[30] Since it is US Federal law,\nit's applicable only to websites that are run:[1][12]\n\n  * by websites under U.S. jurisdiction;\n  * by websites which are hosted on servers in the U.S.;\n  * by websites with owners headquartered in U.S. territory; or\n  * by commercial websites available in U.S. market.\n\n##\nCriticisms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Criticisms\")]\n\nCOPPA is controversial and has been criticized as ineffective and potentially\nunconstitutional by legal experts[31] and mass media[32] since it was\ndrafted.[33] Complaints leveled against the legislation include website owners\nbanning users 12 and under — which only \"encourages age fraud and allows\nwebsites to bypass the burden of obtaining parental consent\"[31] — and the\nactive suppression of children's rights to freedom of speech, self-expression,\nand other [First\nAmendment](/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"First\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\") rights.[34][35]\n\nDelays in obtaining parental consent often result in children moving on to\nother activities that are less appropriate for their age or pose bigger\nprivacy risk.[36]\n\nIn addition, age restrictions and the \"parental consent\" process is easy for\nchildren to circumvent, and parents generally help them to lie about their\nage.[37][38]\n\nAn Internet Safety Technical Task Force composed of experts from academia and\ncommercial companies found in 2012 that mandatory age verification is not only\na poor solution for privacy but also constitutes a violation of privacy.[39]\nThe law has also many safety flaws. For example, it does not protect kids from\npredatory advertising,[40] it does not prevent kids from accessing\n[pornography](/wiki/Pornography \"Pornography\") or lying about their age,[1]\nand it doesn't ensure a totally safe environment online. Tech journalist\n[Larry Magid](/wiki/Larry_Magid \"Larry Magid\"), a long-time vocal opponent of\nthe law[32][34][5] — also notes that parents, not the government, hold the\nbulk of responsibility of protecting children online.[5] COPPA has also been\ncriticized for its potential [chilling effect](/wiki/Chilling_effect \"Chilling\neffect\") on children's apps, content, websites and online services. For\nexample, [Snapchat](/wiki/Snapchat \"Snapchat\") released a Snapkidz version of\nits app in June 2013, but unlike Snapchat, Snapkidz didn't allow photo sharing\nat all due to COPPA regulations.[41] Similarly, it has been pointed out that\nthe COPPA Rule was not necessarily about privacy protection but more about\n\"enforcing the laws.\"[36]\n\nCOPPA's penalties ($40,000 per violation) can be potentially catastrophic for\nthe small businesses, undermining their business model.[42][43] While some\nmajor corporations have enough money to pay the fine or implement a parental\nconsent mechanism, small businesses often cannot afford it.\n\nWith the rise of virtual education COPPA may inadequately represent the role\nof administrators, teachers, and the school in protecting student privacy\nunder the assumption of _[loco parentis](/wiki/In_loco_parentis \"In loco\nparentis\")_.[44]\n\n[Mark Zuckerberg](/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg \"Mark Zuckerberg\"), co-founder and CEO\nof [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\"), has expressed opposition to COPPA\nand stated \"That will be a fight we take on at some point. My philosophy is\nthat for education you need to start at a really, really young age.\"[45]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Adultism](/wiki/Adultism \"Adultism\")\n  * [California Online Privacy Protection Act (OPPA)](/wiki/Online_Privacy_Protection_Act \"Online Privacy Protection Act\") effective as of July 1, 2004\n  * [Child Online Protection Act (COPA)](/wiki/Child_Online_Protection_Act \"Child Online Protection Act\")\n  * [Child Protection Registry Acts](/wiki/Child_Protection_Registry_Acts \"Child Protection Registry Acts\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ [\"Complying with COPPA: Frequently Asked Questions\"](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions). _FTC Business Center_.
