The inaugural tournament was held at\nthe end of the [2014 NCAA Division I FBS football\nseason](/wiki/2014_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_season \"2014 NCAA Division I\nFBS football season\").[1] Four teams play in two semifinal games, and the\nwinner of each semifinal advances to the [College Football Playoff National\nChampionship](/wiki/College_Football_Playoff_National_Championship \"College\nFootball Playoff National Championship\").[2]\n\nThe College Football Playoff is not an officially sanctioned championship\nevent by the NCAA, the sport's governing body. The NCAA has never recognized\nan \"official\" national championship for FBS football, instead merely\nrecognizing the decisions made any of a number of independent [major\nchampionship selectors](/wiki/Major_championship_selectors \"Major championship\nselectors\"). Consequently, Division I FBS football is the only NCAA sport in\nwhich a yearly national champion is not determined by an NCAA event, nor is an\nofficial NCAA national championship awarded.[3][4] Nevertheless, the CFP's\ninauguration in 2014 marked the first time a major championship selector was\nable to determine their champion by using a [bracket\ncompetition](/wiki/Bracket_\\(tournament\\) \"Bracket \\(tournament\\)\").\n\nFrom 2014 until present, a 13-member committee has been selecting and seeding\nthe four teams to take part. [5] This system differs from the use of [polls or\ncomputer rankings](/wiki/Sports_rating_system \"Sports rating system\") that had\npreviously been used to select the participants for the [Bowl Championship\nSeries](/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series \"Bowl Championship Series\") (BCS), the\ntitle system used in FBS from 1998 to 2013. The new format is a [Plus-One\nsystem](/wiki/Plus-One_system \"Plus-One system\"), an idea which became popular\nas an alternative to the BCS after the [2003](/wiki/2003_NCAA_Division_I-\nA_football_season \"2003 NCAA Division I-A football season\") and\n[2004](/wiki/2004_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season \"2004 NCAA Division I-A\nfootball season\") seasons ended in controversy.[6][7]\n\nThe two semifinal games rotate among six major bowl games, referred to as the\n[New Year's Six](/wiki/College_Football_Playoff_New_Year%27s_Six \"College\nFootball Playoff New Year's Six\"): the [Rose Bowl](/wiki/Rose_Bowl_Game \"Rose\nBowl Game\"), [Sugar Bowl](/wiki/Sugar_Bowl \"Sugar Bowl\"), [Orange\nBowl](/wiki/Orange_Bowl \"Orange Bowl\"), [Cotton\nBowl](/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_Classic \"Cotton Bowl Classic\"), [Fiesta\nBowl](/wiki/Fiesta_Bowl \"Fiesta Bowl\"), and [Peach Bowl](/wiki/Peach_Bowl\n\"Peach Bowl\").[8] In addition to the four teams selected for the playoff, the\nfinal CFP rankings are used to help determine the participants for the other\nfour New Year's Six bowls that are not hosting the semifinals that year. The\nNew Year's Six represent six of the ten [oldest bowl\ngames](/wiki/List_of_college_bowl_games \"List of college bowl games\")\ncurrently played at the FBS level. The semifinals are scheduled usually on\nFriday, Saturday, or Monday close to, or on, New Years Day,[9] with some\nflexibility to ensure that bowl games traditionally held on New Year's Day are\nnot in conflict with the semi-final games. The CFP National Championship is\nthen played on the first Monday that is six or more days after the\nsemifinals.[10] The venue of the championship game is selected based on bids\nsubmitted by cities, similar to the [Super Bowl](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super\nBowl\") or [NCAA Final\nFour](/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship \"NCAA Men's\nDivision I Basketball Championship\"). The winner of the game is awarded the\n[College Football Playoff National Championship\nTrophy](/wiki/College_Football_Playoff_National_Championship_Trophy \"College\nFootball Playoff National Championship Trophy\"). Playoff officials\ncommissioned a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous championship\nsystems (such as the [AFCA \"crystal football\"\ntrophy](/wiki/AFCA_National_Championship_Trophy \"AFCA National Championship\nTrophy\") which had been regularly presented after the championship game since\nthe 1990s).[11]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Selection process\n    * 1.1 Selection committee\n      * 1.1.1 Past members\n    * 1.2 Voting procedure\n  * 2 Impact on scheduling\n  * 3 Semifinals\n  * 4 Championship game\n  * 5 Appearances\n    * 5.1 College Football Playoff appearances by team\n    * 5.2 College Football Playoff appearances by conference\n  * 6 Broadcasting\n    * 6.1 Ratings\n  * 7 Revenue\n  * 8 Leadership\n    * 8.1 Board of Managers\n    * 8.2 Athletics Directors Advisory Group\n  * 9 Criticism\n    * 9.1 Team selection\n    * 9.2 Selection committee\n    * 9.3 Scheduling\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n## Selection\nprocess[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Selection process\")]\n\n### Selection\ncommittee[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Selection committee\")]\n\nThe first College Football Playoff selection committee was announced on\nOctober 16, 2013.

Committee stayed at 12 members rather than replacing him.[27]\n\n### Voting\nprocedure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Voting procedure\")]\n\nThe committee releases its top 25 rankings weekly on Tuesdays in the second\nhalf of the regular season. The top four teams are seeded in that order for\nthe playoff.[30] During the season, the committee meets and releases rankings\nsix or seven times, depending on the length of the season (the number of games\nis consistent, but the number of weeks those games are played over can vary\nfrom year to year).[25] The group, which meets at the [Gaylord\nTexan](/wiki/Gaylord_Texan \"Gaylord Texan\") hotel in [Grapevine,\nTexas](/wiki/Grapevine,_Texas \"Grapevine, Texas\"),[31] reportedly meets in\nperson up to 10 total times a year.[22]\n\nA team's [strength of schedule](/wiki/Strength_of_schedule \"Strength of\nschedule\") is one of the most pertinent considerations for the committee in\nmaking its selections.[32] Other factors that the committee weighs are\nconference championships, team records, and head-to-head results,[10] plus\nother points such as injuries and weather.[33] Unlike the\n[BCS](/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series \"Bowl Championship Series\") system, the\n[AP Poll](/wiki/AP_Poll \"AP Poll\"), [Coaches' Poll](/wiki/Coaches%27_Poll\n\"Coaches' Poll\"), and the [Harris\nPoll](/wiki/Harris_Interactive_College_Football_Poll \"Harris Interactive\nCollege Football Poll\"), [computer rankings](/wiki/Sports_rating_system\n\"Sports rating system\") are not used to make the selections.[5][17] Advanced\nstatistics and metrics are expected to be submitted to the committee, though\nlike other analytics, they have no formal role in the decision.[34] Committee\nmembers are not required to attend games.[31]\n\nLong said the panel considered less frequent rankings, but ultimately decided\non a weekly release. \"That's what the fans have become accustomed to, and we\nfelt it would leave a void in college football without a ranking for several\nweeks,\" he said. Long also noted: \"Early on there was some talk that we would\ngo into a room at the end of the season and come out with a top four, but that\ndidn't last long.\"[35] In analyzing this change in thinking, [Stewart\nMandel](/wiki/Stewart_Mandel \"Stewart Mandel\") of _[Sports\nIllustrated](/wiki/Sports_Illustrated \"Sports Illustrated\")_ commented: \"The\nwhole point of the selection committee was to replace the simplistic horse-\nrace nature of Top 25 polls – where teams only move up if someone above them\nloses – with a more deliberative evaluation method. Now the playoff folks are\ngoing to try to do both.\"[36] Addressing the \"pecking order\" nature of\ntraditional polls, George Schrodeder of _[USA Today](/wiki/USA_Today \"USA\nToday\")_ wrote that \"if it actually works as intended, we could see volatile\nswings\" from week to week, with lower-ranked teams moving ahead of higher-\nranked teams without either team losing (a rarity in traditional polls). Both\nLong and Bill Hancock, the CFP executive director, say they expect that to\nhappen.[37]\n\nThe committee's voting method uses multiple ballots, similar to the [NCAA\nbasketball tournament selection\nprocess](/wiki/NCAA_basketball_tournament_selection_process \"NCAA basketball\ntournament selection process\") and the entire process is facilitated through\ncustom software developed by Code Authority in Frisco, Texas.[38] From a large\ninitial pool of teams, the group takes numerous votes on successive tiers of\nteams, considering six at a time and coming to a consensus on how they should\nbe ranked, then repeating the process with the next tier of teams. Discussion\nand debate happens at each voting step. All votes are by secret ballot, and\ncommittee members do not make their ballots public.[35] Each week's ranking\nprocess begins anew, with no weight given to the previous week's\nselections.[37] In this fashion, the committee selects the four teams to\ncompete for the national championship.\n\nCommittee members who are currently employed or financially compensated by a\nschool, or have family members who have a current financial relationship\n(which includes football players), are not allowed to vote for that school.\nDuring deliberations about a team's selection, members with such a conflict of\ninterest cannot be present, but can answer factual questions about the\ninstitution.[35] All committee members have past ties to certain NCAA\ninstitutions,[31] but the committee decided to ignore those ties in the\nrecusal requirements. \"We just boiled it down to where we felt this group was\nfit to its high integrity and would differentiate from those past\nrelationships,\" Long said.[35] Some football writers, like Dennis Dodd and\n[Mark Schlabach](/wiki/Mark_Schlabach \"Mark Schlabach\"), have said the recusal\narrangement isn't transparent or objective, suggesting that members' alma\nmaters and former coaching jobs should be considered disqualifying conflicts\nof interest.[39][40]\n\n## Impact on\nscheduling[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Impact on scheduling\")]\n\n\"Strength of schedule will become such an important factor ... that if you\nwant to be under consideration, you need to have a more meaningful schedule\nthan perhaps you've had in previous years.\"\n\n—[Tom Jernstedt](/wiki/Tom_Jernstedt \"Tom Jernstedt\"), selection committee\nmember _[41]_\n\nDue to the increased emphasis on strength of schedule, teams have considered\nplaying more challenging opponents during the non-conference portion of their\nschedules. Some teams have traditionally played three or four \"weak\" non-\nconference opponents, but wins against such low-level competition are unlikely\nto impress the committee. For teams on the cusp of making the playoff four, \"I\nthink one of the first things the committee will look at is strength of\nschedule,\" said selector [Oliver Luck](/wiki/Oliver_Luck \"Oliver Luck\").[42]\n\nTeams in the Big Ten, Big 12 and Pac-12 play nine conference games on their\ntwelve-game schedules and thus only have flexibility in choosing their\nopponents for the three non-league games. Some programs are opting to increase\ntheir schedule strength by scheduling high-profile matchups at neutral sites\nand on weeknights, garnering primetime TV exclusivity.[43][44]\n\nIn response to the new playoff system, the [Southeastern\nConference](/wiki/Southeastern_Conference \"Southeastern Conference\")\nconsidered increasing its conference schedule from eight to nine games, with\nAlabama coach [Nick Saban](/wiki/Nick_Saban \"Nick Saban\") a vocal\nproponent.[45] According to Jon Solomon of the _[Birmingham\nNews](/wiki/Birmingham_News \"Birmingham News\")_ , \"The prevailing opinion\namong SEC athletics directors: The SEC is difficult enough that there's no\nneed for a ninth game.\"[46] Some in the conference, like Mississippi State\nathletic director [Scott\nStricklin](/wiki/Scott_Stricklin_\\(athletic_director\\) \"Scott Stricklin\n\\(athletic director\\)\"), opined that a nine-game SEC schedule would result in\nmore teams with two losses. Commissioner [Michael Slive](/wiki/Michael_Slive\n\"Michael Slive\") and Vanderbilt AD David Williams, among others, supported a\nstronger out-of-league schedule, which would likely impress the\ncommittee.[46][47] In April 2014, the league voted to mandate that all SEC\nteams must play a Power Five foe (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, or independent\nNotre Dame) in its non-conference slate beginning in 2016. Slive noted this\nrule \"gives us the added strength-of-schedule we were seeking\".[45] In 2014,\nthe first year of the College Football Playoff, one team played two opponents\nfrom the Power Five, nine of the 14 teams played one Power Five conference\nopponent and three lower-level opponents (including one\n[FCS](/wiki/Football_Championship_Subdivision \"Football Championship\nSubdivision\") school), and four teams did not face a Power Five foe.[43] In\nthe spring of 2015, the SEC decided to count games played against Independents\nBYU and Army toward its Power Five requirement.\n\nThe ACC, whose teams also play eight conference games (plus Notre Dame at\nleast once every three years), also considered moving to a nine-game\nconference schedule. However, the league opted to stay with the eight-plus-\nNotre Dame model, stipulating instead that teams would have to play one Power\nFive school in their non-league slates beginning in 2017, which would include\nthe Notre Dame game or other ACC schools,[48] as will games against another\n[FBS independent](/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_FBS_independent_schools \"NCAA Division\nI FBS independent schools\"), [BYU](/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football \"BYU Cougars\nfootball\").[49] Despite the push to increase schedule strength, some ACC\ncoaches preferred the scheduling flexibility available with fewer permanent\nfixtures on a team's slate.[50] Opinion was split among league athletic\ndirectors on moving to a nine-game schedule prior to the vote.[51] An SEC\nexpansion to a nine-game schedule would limit the ACC's opportunities to play\nPower Five non-conference opponents.[52]\n\n##\nSemifinals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Semifinals\")]\n\nMain article: [List of College Football Playoff\ngames](/wiki/List_of_College_Football_Playoff_games \"List of College Football\nPlayoff games\")\n\nThe College Football Playoff uses a four-team knockout bracket to determine\nthe national champion.

The two semifinal bowls and the\nother four top-tier bowls are marketed as the \"**[New Year's\nSix](/wiki/College_Football_Playoff_New_Year%27s_Six \"College Football Playoff\nNew Year's Six\")**\".[54] Three of these bowls played per day, typically on\nconsecutive days that include [New Year's Day](/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day \"New\nYear's Day\").[2] The selection committee seeds and pairs the top four teams,\nand additionally assigns teams to the at-large bowls (Cotton, Fiesta, and\nPeach) in years when they do not host semifinals.[55]\n\nThe four-team format pits the No. 1-ranked team against No. 4 and No. 2 vs.\nNo. 3. The selection committee seeds the two semifinal games, placing the top-\nseeded team at the closest site to prevent it from playing in a \"road\"\nenvironment. There are no limits on the number of teams per conference, a\nchange from previous BCS rules.[2] However, some non-semifinal bowl selections\nstill maintain their conference tie-ins, similarly to the BCS's [automatic\nqualifier](/wiki/Automatic_Qualifying_conference \"Automatic Qualifying\nconference\") berths.[56] A team from one of the \"[Group of\nFive](/wiki/Power_Five_conferences \"Power Five

Playoff games in January 2015 generated larger\nratings than previous BCS games. The [2015 College Football Playoff National\nChampionship](/wiki/2015_College_Football_Playoff_National_Championship \"2015\nCollege Football Playoff National Championship\") had an 18.9 [Nielsen\nrating](/wiki/Nielsen_rating \"Nielsen rating\")[62] and was watched by\napproximately 33.4 million people, the largest broadcast audience of all time\non American [cable](/wiki/Cable_television \"Cable television\") television\n(non-[broadcast](/wiki/Terrestrial_television \"Terrestrial television\")),\naccording to [AdWeek](/wiki/AdWeek \"AdWeek\"). That was a 31 percent audience\nincrease over the previous year's championship game and a 22 percent increase\nover the BCS title game's best rating on cable (a 16.1 rating in\n[2011](/wiki/2011_BCS_National_Championship_Game \"2011 BCS National\nChampionship Game\")).[63] The semifinal games, the [2015 Rose\nBowl](/wiki/2015_Rose_Bowl \"2015 Rose Bowl\") and [2015 Sugar\nBowl](/wiki/2015_Sugar_Bowl \"2015 Sugar Bowl\"), saw 28.16 million and 28.27\nmillion viewers, respectively.[64] According to ESPN, these games also set\n(and briefly held) all-time records for cable TV viewership.[65][66]\n\nIn 2015, the ratings for the two semifinal games were down from the prior\nseason's equivalents, with the Orange Bowl reaching a 9.7 rating (in\ncomparison to 15.5 for the 2015 Rose Bowl) and the Cotton Bowl reaching a 9.9\nrating (in comparison to a 15.3 rating for the 2015 Sugar Bowl). On the online\n[WatchESPN](/wiki/WatchESPN \"WatchESPN\") streaming service, excluding [2014\nFIFA World Cup](/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup \"2014 FIFA World Cup\") games, the\nCotton Bowl and the Orange Bowl drew the second and third-largest streaming\naudiences in the service's history, behind the 2015 national championship. The\nratings drops were attributed to the New Year's Eve time slot, as fewer people\nwere at home to watch the game.[67] The decline in ratings was a factor in\nchanges for the scheduling of future CFP semi-final games.[9]\n\n##\nRevenue[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Revenue\")]\n\nIn 2012, ESPN reportedly paid about $7.3 billion over 12 years for\nbroadcasting rights to all seven games, an average of about $608 million per\nyear. That includes $215 million per year which was already committed to the\nRose, Sugar and Orange bowls,[68] plus $470–475 million annually for the rest\nof the package.[69] By comparison, the most recent contract with the BCS and\nthe Rose Bowl had paid approximately $155 million per year for five games.[70]\n\nThe average revenue to the new system over 12 years is to be about $500\nmillion per year. After $125–150 million in expenses, the Power Five\nconferences split about 71.5 percent of the remaining money, for an\napproximate average payout of $250 million a year ($50 million per league)\nover the life of the contract. The \"Group of Five\" conferences split 27\npercent, about $90 million a year ($18 million per league). Notre Dame\nreceives around one percent, about $3.5-4 million, and other FBS independents\nget about 0.5 percent of the deal.[71][72]\n\nExtra revenue goes to conferences in contracts with the Rose, Sugar, and\nOrange bowls, which split revenue 50/50 between their participating\nleagues.[71] In non-semifinal years, the Rose Bowl's TV revenue would be\ndivided between the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences; likewise, the Sugar Bowl\nand Orange Bowl revenue to its participant conferences. When those bowls are\nsemifinal games, the money is distributed by the playoff system to all FBS\nconferences.[68] ESPN has paid about $80 million a year each for the Rose and\nSugar bowls over 12 years. The Orange Bowl deal is worth $55 million per\nyear.[73] For example, in a non-semifinal year, the Big Ten could receive\nabout $90 million (half of its $80 million Rose Bowl deal plus about $50\nmillion from the playoff system).[71]\n\nConferences receive an additional $6 million each year for each team it places\nin the semifinals and $4 million for a team in one of the three at-large\nbowls; Notre Dame receives the same amount in either scenario. No additional\nmoney is awarded for reaching the championship game.[71]\n\nThe Power Five conferences and the \"Group of Five\" have not decided on their\nrespective revenue-sharing formulas, though the SEC initially receives more\nrevenue than the other four Power Five conferences due to its BCS\nsuccess.[71][72] Reports say the money is to be divided based on several\ncriteria such as \"on-field success, teams' expenses, marketplace factors and\nacademic performance of student-athletes.\"[74] The playoff system awards\nacademic performance bonuses of $300,000 per school for meeting the NCAA's\n[Academic Progress Rate](/wiki/Academic_Progress_Rate \"Academic Progress\nRate\") standard of 930.[71] In a hypothetical 14-team conference, $4.2 million\n($300,000 x 14) would be allocated to that league, and if only 12 of the 14\nmembers meet the APR standard, then each of the 12 schools would receive\n$350,000 ($4.2 million / 12),[72] penalizing schools that fall below the\nthreshold.[75]\n\n##\nLeadership[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Leadership\")]\n\n[BCS Properties, LLC](/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series \"Bowl Championship\nSeries\") [holds](/wiki/Holding_company \"Holding company\") all properties\nrelated to the College Football Playoff.[76] Previous BCS commissioner Bill\nHancock is the [executive director](/wiki/Executive_director \"Executive\ndirector\") of the playoff organization,[77] with former ACC Senior Associate\nCommissioner Michael Kelly as [COO](/wiki/Chief_operating_officer \"Chief\noperating officer\").[78] Like the BCS, the playoff system's management\ncommittee[79] consists of the conference commissioners from the 10 FBS\nconferences[80] and Notre Dame's athletic director.[21] The playoff system's\nheadquarters is in [Irving, Texas](/wiki/Irving,_Texas \"Irving, Texas\").[77]\n\n### Board of\nManagers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Board of Managers\")]\n\nAccording to the CFP website, the system's operations are controlled by the\nBoard of Managers, which consists of presidents and chancellors of the playoff\ngroup's member universities. The eleven members have sole authority to\ndevelop, review and approve annual budgets, policies and operating guidelines.\nThe group also selects the company's officers.[81]\n\n  * Rodney Bennett – President, Southern Mississippi (C-USA)\n  * Anthony Frank – President, Colorado State (Mountain West)\n  * [Burns Hargis](/wiki/Burns_Hargis \"Burns Hargis\") – President, Oklahoma State (Big 12)\n  * Jack Hawkins – Chancellor, Troy (Sun Belt)\n  * Rev.

However, not all teams selected have been\nconference winners. In the [2016–17\nseason](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_NCAA_football_bowl_games \"2016–17 NCAA football\nbowl games\"), one of the teams selected was Ohio State, who did not qualify to\nthe [Big Ten Championship Game](/wiki/2016_Big_Ten_Football_Championship_Game\n\"2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game\"). As a result, both the Big Ten and\nBig 12 champions were not selected for the playoffs. In the [2017–18\nseason](/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_NCAA_football_bowl_games \"2017–18 NCAA football\nbowl games\"), two of the four selected teams were from the SEC: conference\nchampions Georgia, winners of the [SEC Championship\nGame](/wiki/2017_SEC_Championship_Game \"2017 SEC Championship Game\"), and\nAlabama, who lost to SEC Championship Game finalist Auburn. Analysts have\ndiscussed whether the committee should selected conference champions\nonly.[91][92]\n\nAnother critique centered around a perceived bias against smaller conferences\nsuch as the Big 12 which used to not stage a conference championship game, but\nwas reintroduced for the 2017 season. The American addressed this issue by\nadding Navy to its ranks for 2015, bringing its membership to 12 teams, which\nallowed it to stage a conference championship game under then-current NCAA\nrules.[93] Starting with the 2016 season, FBS conferences will be allowed to\nstage football championship games even if they do not have 12 members.[94]\n\nThere are opinions labeling the CFP system \"just as\" or \"even more polarizing\"\nthan the BCS or the old wire-service poll system.[95][96][97][98]\n\n### Selection\ncommittee[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Selection committee\")]\n\nThe qualifications of selection committee members has also been scrutinized.\nAs an outsider to the sports world, [Condoleezza Rice](/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice\n\"Condoleezza Rice\") was the focus of some criticism. Former Clemson head coach\n[Tommy Bowden](/wiki/Tommy_Bowden \"Tommy Bowden\") opined that the committee's\nmembers should be \"people who played the game and preferably coached the\ngame\".[99] Former Auburn head coach [Pat Dye](/wiki/Pat_Dye \"Pat Dye\") said\nthat \"All she knows about football is what somebody told her ... or what she\nread in a book, or what she saw on television. To understand football, you've\ngot to play with your hand in the dirt\". Former Big East commissioner Mike\nTranghese also gained membership on the selection committee despite having\nnever played football in college.[100] Former sportswriter Steve Weiberg and\nretired U.S. Air Force General Michael Gould are other committee members\nwithout significant football playing, coaching or administrative experience.\n\n###\nScheduling[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Scheduling\")]\n\nThe semifinal games for the 2015 season were scheduled for December 31; they\nwere expected to have lower television viewership because the date is not a\n[federal holiday](/wiki/Federal_holiday \"Federal holiday\"), and because the\nsecond game faced heavy competition for television viewers in primetime from\nNew Year's Eve specials (such as _[New Year's Rockin'\nEve](/wiki/New_Year%27s_Rockin%27_Eve \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\")_, which is\naired by ESPN's sister broadcast network\n[ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\")).\nUnder television contracts with ESPN that predate the College Football\nPlayoff, both the Rose and Sugar Bowl games are guaranteed exclusive TV time\nslots on January 1 (or January 2 if New Year's Day falls on a Sunday),\nregardless of whether they are hosting a semifinal game.[101] In an interview\nwith CBS Sports, CFP commissioner Bill Hancock suggested this scheduling issue\nwould \"change the paradigm of what New Year's Eve is all about,\" opining that\n\"if you're hosting a New Year's Eve party, you better have a bunch of\ntelevisions around.\"[102] Although ESPN proposed moving the Thursday, December\n31, 2015 semifinal games to Saturday, January 2, 2016, the idea was\nrejected.[103] The semifinal games' ratings were ultimately down significantly\nfrom those of the previous season.[67]\n\nIn an effort to reduce the impact of their New Year's Eve scheduling, the 2016\nsemifinal games, which fell on a Saturday, had earlier kickoff times, at 3:00\np.m. and 7:00 p.m. ET respectively. The [2016 Orange\nBowl](/wiki/2016_Orange_Bowl \"2016 Orange Bowl\") was played in primetime on\nDecember 30, 2016, rather than in an early afternoon window on New Year's Eve.\nHancock considered the earlier start times to be a compromise to reduce the\ngames' intrusion into New Year's Eve festivities, but reiterated that there\nwere no plans to move the semi-final games from New Year's Eve outside of\nyears where they are hosted by the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl.[104][105]\n\nOn July 28, 2016, however, Hancock reversed this stance and announced\nrevisions to the scheduling for future College Football Playoff semi-final\ngames. The games were rescheduled so that they will not necessarily be played\non New Year's Eve yearly: outside of years when they are hosted by the Rose\nand Sugar Bowls (where they retain their traditional New Year's Day\nscheduling), they will now be scheduled primarily on the last Saturday or\nfederally observed holiday of the year. In some years, this date will land on\nNew Year's Eve. In 2021, the games will be played on Friday, December 31,\nbecause the day will be observed as a holiday.[9][106]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/NCAAFootball_transparent.png/30px-NCAAFootball_transparent.png)](/wiki/File:NCAAFootball_transparent.png)[College football portal](/wiki/Portal:College_football \"Portal:College football\")\n\n  * [College Football Playoff New Year's Six](/wiki/College_Football_Playoff_New_Year%27s_Six \"College Football Playoff New Year's Six\")\n  * [College football playoff debate](/wiki/College_football_playoff_debate \"College football playoff debate\")\n  * [College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS](/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS \"College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS\")\n  * [List of college bowl games](/wiki/List_of_college_bowl_games \"List of college bowl games\")\n  * [Mythical National Championship](/wiki/Mythical_National_Championship \"Mythical National Championship\")\n  * [Plus-One system](/wiki/Plus-One_system \"Plus-One system\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=College_Football_Playoff&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** McMurphy, Brett (April 24, 2013).
