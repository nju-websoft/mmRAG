Eligibility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2009_NBA_draft&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Eligibility\")]\n\nFurther information: [Eligibility for the NBA\ndraft](/wiki/Eligibility_for_the_NBA_draft \"Eligibility for the NBA draft\")\n\nThe basic requirements for draft eligibility are:[35]\n\n  * All drafted players must be born on or before December 31, 1990.\n  * Any player who is not an \"international player\", as defined in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the NBA and its players union, must be at least one year removed from the graduation of his high school class.\n\nThe CBA defines \"international players\" as players who permanently resided\noutside the U.S. for three years prior to the draft, did not complete high\nschool in the U.S., and have never enrolled at a U.S. college or\nuniversity.[36]\n\nThe basic requirement for automatic eligibility for a U.S. player is the\ncompletion of his college eligibility.[37] Players who meet the CBA definition\nof \"international players\" are automatically eligible if their 22nd birthday\nfalls during or before the calendar year of the draft (i.e., born on or before\nDecember 31, 1987).[38] U.S. players who were at least one year removed from\ntheir high school graduation and have played professional basketball with a\nteam outside the NBA were also automatically eligible. Former high school\nplayer [Brandon Jennings](/wiki/Brandon_Jennings \"Brandon Jennings\") meets\nthese criteria, having graduated high school in 2008, skipped [college\nbasketball](/wiki/College_basketball \"College basketball\") and then played\nprofessional basketball in [Italy](/wiki/Lega_Basket_Serie_A \"Lega Basket\nSerie A\").[7]\n\nA player who is not automatically eligible must declare his eligibility for\nthe draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before\nthe draft.[39][40] For the 2009 draft, this date fell on April 26. An early\nentry candidate is allowed to withdraw his eligibility for the draft by\nnotifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 10 days before the\ndraft.[41] This year, a total of 74 collegiate players and 29 international\nplayers declared as early entry candidates.[42] At the withdrawal deadline, 55\nearly-entry candidates withdrew from the draft, leaving 39 collegiate players\nand 10 international players as the early-entry candidates for the draft.[11]\n\nA player who has hired an [agent](/wiki/Sports_agent \"Sports agent\") will\nforfeit his remaining college eligibility, regardless of whether he is\ndrafted. Also, while the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the\nleague and its players' union allows a player to withdraw from the draft\ntwice,[41] the [National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation](/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National\nCollegiate Athletic Association\") (NCAA) mandates that a player who has\ndeclared twice loses his college eligibility. This second provision affected\n[Chase Budinger](/wiki/Chase_Budinger \"Chase Budinger\"), [Wayne\nEllington](/wiki/Wayne_Ellington \"Wayne Ellington\"), and [Ty\nLawson](/wiki/Ty_Lawson \"Ty Lawson\"), all of whom declared for and withdrew\nfrom the 2008 draft.[43]\n\n## Draft\nlottery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2009_NBA_draft&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Draft lottery\")]\n\nFurther information: [NBA draft lottery](/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery \"NBA draft\nlottery\")\n\nThe lottery selection to determine the order of the top fourteen picks in the\n2009 draft occurred on May 19, 2009.[44] The [Los Angeles\nClippers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers \"Los Angeles Clippers\") won the first\npick, while the [Memphis Grizzlies](/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies \"Memphis\nGrizzlies\") and [Oklahoma City Thunder](/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder \"Oklahoma\nCity Thunder\") moved up to second and third picks respectively. The\n[Sacramento Kings](/wiki/Sacramento_Kings \"Sacramento Kings\") and [Washington\nWizards](/wiki/Washington_Wizards \"Washington Wizards\"), who had the two best\nchances to land a top-three pick, fell down to the fourth and fifth spots, the\nlowest possible picks they could be awarded through the lottery.[1] The\nremaining first-round picks and all the second-round picks were assigned to\nteams in reverse order of their win-loss records in the [previous\nseason](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_NBA_season \"2008–09 NBA season\"). As is\ncommonplace in the event of identical win-loss records, the NBA performed a\nrandom drawing to break the ties on April 17, 2009.[45]\n\nBelow were the chances for each team to get specific
