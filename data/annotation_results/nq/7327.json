Timon was portrayed through his many appearances by [Nathan\nLane](/wiki/Nathan_Lane \"Nathan Lane\") (in all three films and early episodes\nof the show), [Max Casella](/wiki/Max_Casella \"Max Casella\") (the original\nactor in [_The Lion King_ Broadway musical](/wiki/The_Lion_King_\\(musical\\)\n\"The Lion King \\(musical\\)\")), [Kevin Schon](/wiki/Kevin_Schon \"Kevin Schon\")\n(in certain episodes of the show), [Quinton Flynn](/wiki/Quinton_Flynn\n\"Quinton Flynn\") (in certain episodes of the show), [Bruce\nLanoil](/wiki/Bruce_Lanoil \"Bruce Lanoil\") in the _Wild About Safety_ shorts\nand _[Kingdom Hearts II](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II \"Kingdom Hearts II\")_ , and\nwhile Pumbaa is voiced by [Ernie Sabella](/wiki/Ernie_Sabella \"Ernie Sabella\")\n(in all of his animated speaking appearances), and was portrayed by [Tom Alan\nRobbins](/wiki/Tom_Alan_Robbins \"Tom Alan Robbins\") in the original cast of\nthe Broadway musical. In the upcoming [live-action\nremake](/wiki/The_Lion_King_\\(2019_film\\) \"The Lion King \\(2019 film\\)\"), the\ncharacters will be portrayed by [Billy Eichner](/wiki/Billy_Eichner \"Billy\nEichner\") and [Seth Rogen](/wiki/Seth_Rogen \"Seth Rogen\") respectively.[1]\nNathan Lane and Ernie Sabella first came to audition for the roles of the\nhyenas, but when the producers saw how well they worked together they decided\nto cast them as Timon and Pumbaa. Lyricist [Tim Rice](/wiki/Tim_Rice \"Tim\nRice\") however was pulling for [Rik Mayall](/wiki/Rik_Mayall \"Rik Mayall\")\n(for Timon) and [Adrian Edmondson](/wiki/Adrian_Edmondson \"Adrian Edmondson\")\n(for Pumbaa) to play the roles, as he got the idea for the lyrics to \"[Hakuna\nMatata](/wiki/Hakuna_Matata_\\(song\\) \"Hakuna Matata \\(song\\)\")\" by watching\ntheir show _[Bottom](/wiki/Bottom_\\(TV_series\\) \"Bottom \\(TV series\\)\")_.\n\nAs with many [characters](/wiki/Fictional_character \"Fictional character\") in\n_[Lion King](/wiki/The_Lion_King \"The Lion King\")_ , Pumbaa's name derives\nfrom the East African language [Swahili](/wiki/Swahili_language \"Swahili\nlanguage\"). In Swahili, _[pumbaa](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pumbaa\n\"wikt:pumbaa\") (v.)_ means \"to be foolish, silly, weakminded, careless,\nnegligent\".[2] Timon is one of the few characters whose name has no meaning in\nSwahili; _[Timon](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Timon \"wikt:Timon\")_ is a\nhistorical [Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\") name, taken to mean\n\"he who respects\". Timon's name may also possibly derive from\n[Shakespeare](/wiki/William_Shakespeare \"William Shakespeare\")'s tragedy\n_[Timon of Athens](/wiki/Timon_of_Athens \"Timon of Athens\")_ , another\nShakespeare reference in a film which derives its plot from\n_[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet \"Hamlet\")_.\n\nTimon is a wise-cracking and self-absorbed meerkat who is known for claiming\nPumbaa's ideas as his own, while Pumbaa has flatulence issues. However, Pumbaa\nis also a fierce [warrior](/wiki/Warrior \"Warrior\"), charging into battle like\na battering ram, and taking great offense if anyone who's not his friend calls\nhim a pig, at which point he exclaims \"They call me _Mister_ pig!\"—a reference\nto Sidney Poitier's line \"They call me _Mister_ Tibbs!\" from the 1967 film\n_[In the Heat of the Night](/wiki/In_the_Heat_of_the_Night_\\(film\\) \"In the\nHeat of the Night \\(film\\)\")_. Unlike real meerkats, Timon can walk on his\nhind legs, while in real life, meerkats walk on all four legs and can only\n_stand_ on their hind ones. In the wild, banded mongoose have a special\nrelationship with warthogs, which is portrayed in the Disney film.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Appearances\n    * 1.1 _The Lion King_\n    * 1.2 _The Lion King II: Simba 's Pride_\n    * 1.3 _The Lion King 1½_\n    * 1.4 _The Lion King 's Timon & Pumbaa_\n    * 1.5 _The Lion Guard_\n  * 2 Other appearances\n    * 2.1 _Kingdom Hearts_\n    * 2.2 Walt Disney Parks and Resorts\n    * 2.3 Educational shorts\n  * 3 References\n\n## Appearances\n\n### _The Lion King_\n\nMain article: [The Lion King](/wiki/The_Lion_King \"The Lion King\")\n\nBased on the characters [Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern](/wiki/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern \"Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern\") from _Hamlet_ , Timon and Pumbaa are played by [Nathan\nLane](/wiki/Nathan_Lane \"Nathan Lane\") and [Ernie Sabella](/wiki/Ernie_Sabella\n\"Ernie Sabella\"). Timon was animated and created by Michael Surrey. They made\ntheir first appearances in [the 1994 film](/wiki/The_Lion_King \"The Lion\nKing\") when they shooed away the [vultures](/wiki/Vultures \"Vultures\") that\nswarmed around young Simba, who had collapsed from [heat\nexhaustion](/wiki/Heat_exhaustion \"Heat exhaustion\"). Timon and Pumbaa then\ntook the collapsed lion cub back to a small pool, where they splashed water on\nhim to wake him up. After Simba is awakened by the two, they introduce\nthemselves and welcome Simba to stay with them and follow their _[hakuna\nmatata](/wiki/Hakuna_matata \"Hakuna matata\")_ philosophy. At first, Simba is\nconfused about Timon and Pumbaa's lifestyle, but it is explained to him in the\nsong \"[Hakuna Matata](/wiki/Hakuna_Matata_\\(song\\) \"Hakuna Matata \\(song\\)\")\".\n\nMany years later, while out on a musical walk with Timon, Pumbaa is distracted\nby a bug, which he follows into the jungle. The bug leads him right to a\nhungry lioness prowling around, who then tries to hunt down Pumbaa. She chases\nthe warthog until Simba springs into action, and the two lions engage in\nconflict. When the lioness pins Simba, he recognizes her as Nala, his\nchildhood playmate. They are happy to be together, but Timon is jealous after\nthey leave for a night of romance. He and Pumbaa start singing the song \"[Can\nYou Feel The Love Tonight](/wiki/Can_You_Feel_The_Love_Tonight \"Can You Feel\nThe Love Tonight\")?\" and are joined by Simba and Nala on their night out.\nStill, the two help Simba defeat Scar and gain his rightful place as the king\nof the Pride Lands, most notably when they create a hula distraction to lure\naway Scar's hyenas. Pumbaa single-handedly drives off [Shenzi, Banzai and\nEd](/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed \"Shenzi, Banzai and Ed\"). They also stand on\ntop of Pride Rock along with Simba and Nala when Rafiki presents Simba and\nNala's newborn cub to the animals of the Pride Lands.\n\n### _The Lion King II: Simba 's Pride_\n\nMain article: [The Lion King II: Simba's\nPride](/wiki/The_Lion_King_II:_Simba%27s_Pride \"The Lion King II: Simba's\nPride\")\n\nIt is unclear whether Timon and Pumbaa have taken up residence at Pride Rock,\nor just make frequent visits. They serve as aides to Simba, and are often\ncalled upon to keep an eye on his adventurous daughter Kiara so in a way\nreplacing Zazu's role as babysitters. Despite being bumbling, Simba trusts\nthem to look after Kiara, and does not blame them when Kiara runs off as Kiara\nis known to do just that. When Kiara goes on her first hunt, they are hired to\nmake sure she won't get hurt. Enraged, she escapes from the Pridelands to hunt\noutside the boundary. Timon and Pumbaa also teach Kovu how to have fun after\nhe forgets due to years of indoctrination in hatred. When Kovu's pride, the\nOutsiders, turn on Simba and ambush him, Timon is on Simba's side\nautomatically, not even wanting to hear his argument. They later assist in the\nbattle against Kovu's manipulative and vengeful mother Zira, and her pride of\nexiled lions, but get chased off and cornered by a group, until Timon\nthreatens to use Pumbaa's tail as a gun and use his gas on them causing them\nto flee in fear. Despite being slightly cowardly, they are willing to fight\nfor what is right. When Simba tries to make peace with Zira after realizing\nthat both prides \"were one\", he uses the same advice Timon and Pumbaa gave him\nwhen he was a cub (put the past behind you) showing how much he had learned\nfrom his old friends.\n\n### _The Lion King 1½_\n\nMain article: [The Lion King 1½](/wiki/The_Lion_King_1%C2%BD \"The Lion King\n1½\")\n\nTimon and Pumbaa are the main characters in this followup, and are revealed to\nhave passed by and caused some key events in the first film before their first\nappearance. Timon, his mother Ma and Uncle Max were part of a group of\nmeerkats who lived on the savannah, but he was unable to do any job properly,\nand almost led to the meerkat being eaten by the hyenas [Shenzi, Banzai and\nEd](/wiki/Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed \"Shenzi, Banzai and Ed\") (Pumbaa was revealed\nto have blocked out part of the scene by sitting on the remote). Feeling\ndepressed, he received counsel from [Rafiki](/wiki/Rafiki \"Rafiki\"), who\ntaught him the \"[Hakuna Matata](/wiki/Hakuna_Matata \"Hakuna Matata\")\"\nphilosophy and told him to \"look beyond what you see.\" Timon took this\nliterally, and set off to find the ultimate paradise. Along the way, he first\nencountered Pumbaa, and the two became friends. On the way to find paradise,\nthey passed by the presentation of Simba (it turns out that Pumbaa\naccidentally [passed some gas](/wiki/Flatulence \"Flatulence\") and the smell\nmade a few animals collapse, causing the other animals to think they were\nbowing and later they all bowed) and Mufasa was very puzzled at seeing this\nand his majordomo Zazu then tells him they are bowing to his son; Simba, Nala,\nand when the animals are singing \"[I Just Can't Wait To Be\nKing](/wiki/I_Just_Can%27t_Wait_To_Be_King \"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\")\"\n(it was Timon who hit an elephant's leg with a stick, causing the tower of\nanimals to collapse); the elephant graveyard where Mufasa was on his way to\nsave Simba and Nala from the hyenas (\"I see _carnivores_ \"); the hyenas\nmarching to \"[Be Prepared](/wiki/Be_Prepared_\\(song\\) \"Be Prepared \\(song\\)\")\"\n(\"something tells me this ain't the traveling company of\n[Riverdance](/wiki/Riverdance \"Riverdance\")\"); and the wildebeest stampede\n(\"Shall we run for our lives?\" \"Oh yes, let's.\"). Finally, they reach a\nbeautiful oasis and are enjoying life until they find a collapsed Simba. After\nrescuing Simba, Timon and Pumbaa find themselves with their hands full trying\nto keep up with the mischievous cub.\n\nThe film also shows more of Simba's life with Timon and Pumbaa before Nala\ncame along, stating that Simba had beaten Timon in every bug-eating contest\nthey had done with one another. Timon and Pumbaa, afraid that Nala would take\naway their friend, attempted to spoil Simba and Nala's date by letting out\nbees, a spider, and tripping the two (explaining why they fell down the hill\nin the first film), but all failed. Later on, they see Simba and Nala\nquarrelling. They also mistake the appearance of Mufasa's ghost as bad weather\n(\"I think the storm is coming to a head\"). After they realize Simba has gone\nback to take his rightful place as king, it is revealed that Pumbaa had set\noff to help Simba before Timon, who was indifferent and reluctant. Timon\neventually came to his senses thanks to Rafiki's continued advice, and quickly\nfollowed, after which Rafiki says, \"My work here is done.\" The duo provides\ntheir hula distraction (shown in the first film. This apparently was Timon's\nfault because before he did the dance, he asked Simba what his plan was to get\npast the hyenas, Simba replies \"Live bait.\" When Timon realizes he and Pumbaa\nwere the live bait, he sarcastically asked Simba \"What do you want me to do?\nDress in drag and do the hula?\".[3] A few seconds later, the hyenas wake up\nand see Timon in a hula skirt, a flower, and a flower necklace and Pumbaa like\na cooked pig), the two run into Ma and Uncle Max, who had been searching for\nTimon ever since he left the meerkat colony. Later on during the fight, they\ndefeated the hyenas by digging a massive tunnel network, sending the hyenas\ndown Pride Rock where they get to take revenge on Scar who had betrayed them.\nThis scene explains what happened to Timon and Pumbaa while Simba is fighting\nScar. After Scar is killed in the first film and this film, Timon and Pumbaa\nshow up alive and unharmed against the hyenas that chased them, suggesting to\naudiences that they have either outsmarted or beat up the hyenas in the first\nfilm. At the end, Timon takes his entire meerkat colony to live in the oasis,\nfree from threats.\n\nDespite the appearance of Timon's mother, Ma (who was also given reference in\nat least one episode of _Timon and Pumbaa_) and his Uncle Max (believed to be\nhis great uncle due to his age-which may be premature-and the fact that Ma\nalso calls him 'Uncle' Max), Timon's father is never mentioned. However, in\ndeleted scenes, Timon's father is an active character, though he was\napparently replaced by Uncle Max.\n\n### _The Lion King 's Timon & Pumbaa_\n\nMain article: [Timon & Pumbaa (TV\nseries)](/wiki/Timon_%26_Pumbaa_\\(TV_series\\) \"Timon & Pumbaa \\(TV series\\)\")\n\nTimon and Pumbaa starred in their own [animated television\nseries](/wiki/Animated_television_series \"Animated television series\") which\nfocuses on their lives. The duo is seen having misadventures in the jungle and\nthey are also seen visiting different places around the world, such as the\nUnited States, Spain, and France. This series also reveals their last names:\nTimon's is revealed to be **Berkowitz** while Pumbaa's is revealed to be\n**Smith**.\n\nIt is revealed in the series that before Timon met Pumbaa, he had a best\nfriend named Fred, who enjoys pulling practical jokes. In the episode \"Isle of\nManhood\", it is shown that Timon attempts to pass the test of manhood in order\nto become brave and manly instead of the cowardly meerkat he sometimes claims\nhimself to be. In Pumbaa's case, it is revealed that he was once a member of a\nwarthog sounder, but by the time he was fully grown, the warthogs banished him\nbecause of his smell, which was appalling even by warthog standards. It is\nalso stated that years before the episode \"Madagascar About You\", an arranged\nmarriage has been set up for Pumbaa before he was even born.\n\nIt is notable that a pre-existing storyline of how Timon met Pumbaa appeared\nin this series. This would make the series and _The Lion King 1½_ independent\ncontinuities. However, this pre-existing storyline was later\n[retconned](/wiki/Retcon \"Retcon\") into being a fictional story that Rafiki\nwas telling Zazu.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### _The Lion Guard_\n\nMain article: [The Lion Guard](/wiki/The_Lion_Guard \"The Lion Guard\")\n\nTimon and Pumbaa appear with several of the film's other characters in the\n[Disney Junior](/wiki/Disney_Junior \"Disney Junior\") series _The Lion Guard_ ,\nwhich centers around Simba's second-born cub, Kion. During the series, which\nis set within the time gap in _[The Lion King II: Simba's\nPride](/wiki/The_Lion_King_II:_Simba%27s_Pride \"The Lion King II: Simba's\nPride\")_,[4] Timon and Pumbaa are adoptive uncles of a young honey badger\nnamed Bunga, who is one of the members of the Lion Guard. When Bunga was an\ninfant, he encountered Timon and Pumbaa singing \"Utamu.\" Instantly smitten,\nBunga had begun following them around. Pumbaa wanted to keep Bunga, but Timon\ndidn't want to raise anymore kids since he and Pumbaa have already done so\nwith Simba, but the two friends see that the honey badger wants to be with\nthem as well. Before he accepted Bunga, Timon instructed the honey badger to\nclimb a tree and fetch them some Utamu grubs. When Bunga had succeeded and\ngiven the grubs to Timon, the meerkat had allowed him to stay, and the three\nhave lived together ever since.\n\n## Other appearances\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Pumba.jpg/250px-\nPumba.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pumba.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pumba.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStencil (Puma AG parody)\n\nTimon and Pumbaa made regular appearances in the animated television series\n_[Disney's House of Mouse](/wiki/Disney%27s_House_of_Mouse \"Disney's House of\nMouse\")_ (2001–2002) as guests and also appeared in _[Mickey's Magical\nChristmas: Snowed in at the House of\nMouse](/wiki/Mickey%27s_Magical_Christmas:_Snowed_in_at_the_House_of_Mouse\n\"Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse\")_.

Timon appears briefly in the _Virtual Magic\nCarpet Ride_ game included on disc 2 of the 2004\n_[Aladdin](/wiki/Aladdin_\\(1992_Disney_film\\) \"Aladdin \\(1992 Disney film\\)\")_\nPlatinum Edition DVD.
