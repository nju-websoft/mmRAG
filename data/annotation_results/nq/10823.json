It premiered at the [Royal Theatre](/wiki/Royal_Danish_Theatre \"Royal\nDanish Theatre\") in [Copenhagen](/wiki/Copenhagen \"Copenhagen\"),\n[Denmark](/wiki/Denmark \"Denmark\"), on 21 December 1879, having been published\nearlier that month.[1] The play is set in a Norwegian town circa 1879.\n\nThe play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman,\nwho at the time [in Norway](/wiki/Feminism_in_Norway \"Feminism in Norway\")\nlacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated\nworld. It aroused a great sensation at the time,[2] and caused a “storm of\noutraged controversy” that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and\nsociety.[3]\n\nIn 2006, the centennial of Ibsen's death, _A Doll 's House_ held the\ndistinction of being the world's most performed play that year.[4]\n[UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO \"UNESCO\") has inscribed Ibsen's autographed manuscripts\nof _A Doll 's House_ on the [Memory of the World\nRegister](/wiki/Memory_of_the_World_Register \"Memory of the World Register\")\nin 2001, in recognition of their historical value.[5]\n\nThe title of the play is most commonly translated as _A Doll 's House_, though\nsome scholars use _A Doll House_. [John Simon](/wiki/John_Simon_\\(critic\\)\n\"John Simon \\(critic\\)\") says that _A Doll’s House_ is \"the British term for\nwhat we call a 'dollhouse'\".[6] [Egil Törnqvist](/wiki/Egil_T%C3%B6rnqvist\n\"Egil Törnqvist\") says of the alternative title: \"Rather than being superior\nto the traditional rendering, it simply sounds more idiomatic to\nAmericans.\"[7]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 List of characters\n  * 2 Synopsis\n    * 2.1 Act One\n    * 2.2 Act Two\n    * 2.3 Act Three\n    * 2.4 Alternative ending\n  * 3 Composition and publication\n    * 3.1 Real-life inspiration\n    * 3.2 Composition\n    * 3.3 Publication\n  * 4 Production history\n  * 5 Analysis and criticism\n  * 6 Adaptations\n    * 6.1 Film\n    * 6.2 Television\n    * 6.3 Radio\n    * 6.4 Re-staging\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 Sources\n  * 9 Further reading\n  * 10 External links\n\n## List of\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: List of characters\")]\n\n  * **Nora Helmer** – wife of Torvald, mother of three, is living out the ideal of the 19th-century wife, but leaves her family at the end of the play.\n  * **Torvald Helmer** – Nora's husband, a newly promoted bank manager, professes to be enamoured of his wife but their marriage stifles her.\n  * **Dr. Rank** – a rich family friend, he is secretly in love with Nora.

Nora's husband Torvald is working in\nhis study when she arrives. He playfully rebukes her for spending so much\nmoney on Christmas gifts, calling her his \"little squirrel.\" He teases her\nabout how the previous year she had spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by\nhand because money was scarce. This year Torvald is due a promotion at the\nbank where he works, so Nora feels that they can let themselves go a little.\nThe maid announces two visitors: Mrs. Kristine Linde, an old friend of Nora's,\nwho has come seeking employment; and Dr. Rank, a close friend of the family,\nwho is let into the study. Kristine has had a difficult few years, ever since\nher husband died leaving her with no money or children. Nora says that things\nhave not been easy for them either: Torvald became sick, and they had to\ntravel to [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\") so he could recover. Kristine explains\nthat when her mother was ill she had to take care of her brothers, but now\nthat they are grown she feels her life is \"unspeakably empty.\" Nora promises\nto talk to Torvald about finding her a job. Kristine gently tells Nora that\nshe is like a child. Nora is offended, so she teases the idea that she got\nmoney from \"some admirer,\" so they could travel to Italy to improve Torvald's\nhealth. She told Torvald that her father gave her the money, but in fact she\nmanaged to illegally borrow it without his knowledge because women couldn't do\nanything economical like signing checks without their husband. Over the years,\nshe has been secretly working and saving up to pay it off.\n\nKrogstad, a lower-level employee at Torvald's bank, arrives and goes into the\nstudy. Nora is clearly uneasy when she sees him. Dr. Rank leaves the study and\nmentions that he feels wretched, though like everyone he wants to go on\nliving. In contrast to his physical illness, he says that the man in the\nstudy, Krogstad, is \"morally diseased.\"\n\nAfter the meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes out of the study. Nora asks him\nif he can give Kristine a position at the bank and Torvald is very positive,\nsaying that this is a fortunate moment, as a position has just become\navailable. Torvald, Kristine, and Dr. Rank leave the house, leaving Nora\nalone. The nanny returns with the children and Nora plays with them for a\nwhile until Krogstad creeps into the living room and surprises her. Krogstad\ntells Nora that Torvald intends to fire him at the bank and asks her to\nintercede with Torvald to allow him to keep his job. She refuses, and Krogstad\nthreatens to blackmail her about the loan she took out for the trip to Italy;\nhe knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father's signature.\nKrogstad leaves and when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to\nfire Krogstad. Torvald refuses to hear her pleas, explaining that Krogstad is\na liar and a hypocrite and that he committed a terrible crime: he forged\nsomeone's name. Torvald feels physically ill in the presence of a man\n\"poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation.\"\n\n### Act Two[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Act Two\")]\n\nKristine arrives to help Nora repair a dress for a costume function that she\nand Torvald plan to attend the next day. Torvald returns from the bank, and\nNora pleads with him to reinstate Krogstad, claiming she is worried Krogstad\nwill publish libelous articles about Torvald and ruin his career. Torvald\ndismisses her fears and explains that, although Krogstad is a good worker and\nseems to have turned his life around, he must be fired because he is not\ndeferential enough to Torvald in front of other bank personnel. Torvald then\nretires to his study to work.\n\nDr. Rank, the family friend, arrives. Nora asks him for a favor, but Rank\nresponds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of\n[tuberculosis](/wiki/Tuberculosis \"Tuberculosis\") of the spine and that he has\nalways been secretly in love with her. Nora tries to deny the first revelation\nand make light of it, but is more disturbed by his declaration of love. She\ntries clumsily to tell him that she is not in love with him, but that she\nloves him dearly as a friend.\n\nDesperate after being fired by Torvald, Krogstad arrives at the house. Nora\nconvinces Dr. Rank to go into Torvald's study so he will not see Krogstad.\nWhen Krogstad confronts Nora, he declares that he no longer cares about the\nremaining balance of Nora's loan, but that he will instead preserve the\nassociated [bond](/wiki/Bond_\\(finance\\) \"Bond \\(finance\\)\") to blackmail\nTorvald into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him. Nora\nexplains that she has done her best to persuade her husband, but he refuses to\nchange his mind. Krogstad informs Nora that he has written a letter detailing\nher crime (forging her father's signature of [surety](/wiki/Surety \"Surety\")\non the bond) and put it in Torvald's mailbox, which is locked.\n\nNora tells Kristine of her difficult situation. Having had a relationship with\nKrogstad in the past before her marriage, Kristine says that they are still in\nlove and promises to try to convince him to relent.\n\nTorvald enters and tries to retrieve his mail, but Nora distracts him by\nbegging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume\nparty, feigning anxiety about performing. She dances so badly and acts so\nchildishly that Torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her. When\nthe others go to dinner, Nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates\nkilling herself to save her husband from the shame of the revelation of her\ncrime and to pre-empt any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation.\n\n### Act Three[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Act Three\")]\n\nKristine tells Krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no\nother means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has\nreturned to offer him her love again. She believes that he would not have\nstooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment\nand been in dire financial straits. Krogstad changes his mind and offers to\ntake back his letter to Torvald. However, Kristine decides that Torvald should\nknow the truth for the sake of his and Nora's marriage.\n\nAfter literally dragging Nora home from the party, Torvald goes to check his\nmail but is interrupted by Dr. Rank, who has followed them. Dr. Rank chats for\na while, conveying obliquely to Nora that this is a final goodbye, as he has\ndetermined that his death is near. Dr. Rank leaves, and Torvald retrieves his\nletters. As he reads them, Nora steels herself to take her life. Torvald\nconfronts her with Krogstad's letter. Enraged, he declares that he is now\ncompletely in Krogstad's power; he must yield to Krogstad's demands and keep\nquiet about the whole affair. He berates Nora, calling her a dishonest and\nimmoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their children. He\nsays that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances.\n\nA maid enters, delivering a letter to Nora. The letter is from Krogstad, yet\nTorvald demands to read the letter and takes it from Nora. Torvald exults that\nhe is saved, as Krogstad has returned the incriminating bond, which Torvald\nimmediately burns along with Krogstad's letters. He takes back his harsh words\nto his wife and tells her that he forgives her. Nora realizes that her husband\nis not the strong and gallant man she thought he was, and that he truly loves\nhimself more than he does her.\n\nTorvald explains that when a man has forgiven his wife it makes him love her\nall the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him, like a\nchild. He dismisses the fact that Nora had to make the agonizing choice\nbetween her conscience and his health, and ignores her years of secret efforts\nto free them from the ensuing obligations and the danger of loss of\nreputation. He preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as a\nmere mistake that she made owing to her dumbness, one of her most endearing\nfeminine traits.\n\n_**We must come to a final settlement, Torvald. During eight whole years. . .\nwe have never exchanged one serious word about serious things.**_\n\nNora, in [Ibsen's](/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen \"Henrik Ibsen\") _A Doll 's House_ (1879)\n\nNora tells Torvald that she is leaving him, and in a confrontational scene\nbetween the two of them, she expresses her reasons and explanations. She\nreminds him of harsh things he has said about her and about her ability to\nraise their children. She says he has never loved her, they have become\nstrangers to each other. She feels betrayed by his response to the scandal\ninvolving Krogstad, and she says she must get away to understand herself. She\nhas lost her religion. She says that she has been treated like a doll to play\nwith for her whole life, first by her father and then by him. Concerned for\nthe family reputation, Torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and\nmother, but Nora says that she has duties to herself that are just as\nimportant, and that she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be\nmore than a plaything. She reveals that she had expected that he would want to\nsacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to\nprevent him from doing so. She now realizes that Torvald is not at all the\nkind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been\nbased on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings.\n\nTorvald is unable to comprehend Nora's point of view, since it contradicts all\nthat he has been taught about the female mind throughout his life.\nFurthermore, he is so narcissistic that it is impossible for him to understand\nhow he appears to her, as selfish, hypocritical, and more concerned with\npublic reputation than with actual morality. Nora leaves her keys and wedding\nring, and as Torvald breaks down and begins to cry, baffled by what has\nhappened, Nora leaves the house, slamming the door behind her. Whether or not\nshe ever comes back is never made clear.\n\n### Alternative\nending[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Alternative ending\")]\n\nIbsen's German agent felt that the original ending would not play well in\nGerman theatres. Therefore, for it to be considered acceptable, Ibsen was\nforced to write an alternative ending for the German premiere. In this ending,\nNora is led to her children after having argued with Torvald. Seeing them, she\ncollapses, and the curtain is brought down. Ibsen later called the ending a\ndisgrace to the original play and referred to it as a \"barbaric outrage\".[9]\nVirtually all productions today use the original ending, as do nearly all of\nthe film versions of the play.\n\n## Composition and\npublication[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Composition and publication\")]\n\n### Real-life\ninspiration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Real-life inspiration\")]\n\n_A Doll 's House_ was based on the life of [Laura Kieler](/wiki/Laura_Kieler\n\"Laura Kieler\") (maiden name Laura Smith Petersen), a good friend of Ibsen.\nMuch that happened between Nora and Torvald happened to Laura and her husband,\nVictor. Similar to the events in the play, Laura signed an illegal loan to\nsave her husband. She wanted the money to find a cure for her husband's\ntuberculosis.[10] She wrote to Ibsen, asking for his recommendation of her\nwork to his publisher, thinking that the sales of her book would repay her\ndebt. At his refusal, she forged a check for the money. At this point she was\nfound out. In real life, when Victor discovered about Laura's secret loan, he\ndivorced her and had her committed to an asylum. Two years later, she returned\nto her husband and children at his urging, and she went on to become a well-\nknown Danish author, living to the age of 83.\n\nIbsen wrote _A Doll 's House_ at the point when Laura Kieler had been\ncommitted to the asylum, and the fate of this friend of the family shook him\ndeeply, perhaps also because Laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial\npoint in the scandal, which he did not feel able or willing to do. Instead, he\nturned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped, successful drama. In\nthe play, Nora leaves Torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain\nfuture given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time.\n\nKieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own\nsuccessful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition\nas \"Ibsen's Nora\" years afterwards.[11][12]\n\n###\nComposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\nIbsen started thinking about the play around May 1878, although he did not\nbegin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and\ncharacters in the intervening period (he visualised its\n[protagonist](/wiki/Protagonist \"Protagonist\"), Nora, for instance, as having\napproached him one day wearing \"a blue woollen dress\").[13] He outlined his\nconception of the play as a \"modern [tragedy](/wiki/Tragedy \"Tragedy\")\" in a\nnote written in Rome on 19 October 1878.[14] \"A woman cannot be herself in\nmodern society,\" he argues, since it is \"an exclusively male society, with\nlaws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct\nfrom a masculine standpoint.\"[15]\n\n###\nPublication[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Publication\")]\n\nIbsen sent a [fair copy](/wiki/Foul_papers \"Foul papers\") of the completed\nplay to his publisher on 15 September 1879.[16] It was first published in\nCopenhagen on 4 December 1879, in an edition of 8,000 copies that sold out\nwithin a month; a second edition of 3,000 copies followed on 4 January 1880,\nand a third edition of 2,500 was issued on 8 March.[17]\n\n## Production\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Production history\")]\n\n_A Doll 's House_ received its world premiere on 21 December 1879 at the\n[Royal Theatre](/wiki/Royal_Danish_Theatre \"Royal Danish Theatre\") in\nCopenhagen, with Betty Hennings as Nora, Emil Poulsen as Torvald, and [Peter\nJerndorff](/wiki/Peter_Jerndorff \"Peter Jerndorff\") as Dr. Rank.[18] Writing\nfor the Norwegian newspaper _Folkets Avis_ , the critic [Erik\nBøgh](/wiki/Erik_B%C3%B8gh \"Erik Bøgh\") admired Ibsen's originality and\ntechnical mastery: \"Not a single declamatory phrase, no high dramatics, no\ndrop of blood, not even a tear.\"[19] Every performance of its run was sold\nout.[20] Another production opened at the [Royal\nTheatre](/wiki/Royal_Dramatic_Theatre \"Royal Dramatic Theatre\") in\n[Stockholm](/wiki/Stockholm \"Stockholm\"), on 8 January 1880, while productions\nin [Christiania](/wiki/Oslo \"Oslo\") (with Johanne Juell as Nora and Arnoldus\nReimers as Torvald) and [Bergen](/wiki/Bergen \"Bergen\") followed shortly\nafter.[21]\n\nIn Germany, the actress [Hedwig Niemann-Raabe](/wiki/Hedwig_Raabe \"Hedwig\nRaabe\") refused to perform the play as written, declaring, \"_I_ would never\nleave _my_ children!\"[20] Since the playwright's wishes were not protected by\ncopyright, Ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being rewritten by a lesser\ndramatist by committing what he called a \"barbaric outrage\" on his play\nhimself and giving it an alternative ending in which Nora did not\nleave.[22][23] A production of this version opened in\n[Flensburg](/wiki/Flensburg \"Flensburg\") in February 1880.[24] This version\nwas also played in [Hamburg](/wiki/Hamburg \"Hamburg\"), [Dresden](/wiki/Dresden\n\"Dresden\"), [Hanover](/wiki/Hanover \"Hanover\"), and [Berlin](/wiki/Berlin\n\"Berlin\"), although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, Niemann-\nRaabe eventually restored the original ending.[24] Another production of the\noriginal version, some rehearsals of which Ibsen attended, opened on 3 March\n1880 at the [Residenz Theatre](/wiki/Residenz_Theatre \"Residenz Theatre\") in\n[Munich](/wiki/Munich \"Munich\").[24]\n\nIn Great Britain, the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be\ngiven in London was in an adaptation by [Henry Arthur\nJones](/wiki/Henry_Arthur_Jones \"Henry Arthur Jones\") and [Henry\nHerman](/wiki/Henry_Herman \"Henry Herman\") called _Breaking a Butterfly_.[25]\nThis adaptation was produced at the Princess Theatre, 3 March 1884. Writing in\n1896 in his book _The Foundations of a National Drama_ , Jones says: \"A rough\ntranslation from the German version of A Doll's House was put into my hands,\nand I was told that if it could be turned into a sympathetic play, a ready\nopening would be found for it on the London boards. I knew nothing of Ibsen,\nbut I knew a great deal of Robertson and H. J. Byron. From these circumstances\ncame the adaptation called _Breaking a Butterfly_.\"[26] [H. L.\nMencken](/wiki/H._L._Mencken \"H. L. Mencken\") writes that it was _A Doll’s\nHouse_ “denaturized and [dephlogisticated](/wiki/Dephlogisticated\n\"Dephlogisticated\"). … Toward the middle of the action Ibsen was thrown to the\nfishes, and Nora was saved from suicide, rebellion, flight and immortality by\nmaking a faithful old clerk steal her fateful promissory note from Krogstad’s\ndesk. … The curtain fell upon a happy home.“[27]\n\nBefore 1899 there were two private productions of the play in London (in its\noriginal form as Ibsen wrote it) — one featured [George Bernard\nShaw](/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw \"George Bernard Shaw\") in the role of\nKrogstad.[8] The first public British production of the play in its regular\nform opened on 7 June 1889 at the Novelty Theatre, starring [Janet\nAchurch](/wiki/Janet_Achurch \"Janet Achurch\") as Nora and Charles Charrington\nas Torvald.[28][29][30] Achurch played Nora again for a 7-day run in 1897.\nSoon after its London premiere, Achurch brought the play to\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") in 1889.[31]\n\nThe play was first seen in America in 1883 in [Louisville,\nKentucky](/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky \"Louisville, Kentucky\"); [Helena\nModjeska](/wiki/Helena_Modjeska \"Helena Modjeska\") acted Nora.[29] The play\nmade its [Broadway](/wiki/Broadway_theatre \"Broadway theatre\") premiere at the\nPalmer's Theatre on 21 December 1889, starring [Beatrice\nCameron](/wiki/Beatrice_Cameron \"Beatrice Cameron\") as Nora Helmer.[32] It was\nfirst performed in France in 1894.[21] Other productions in the United States\ninclude one in 1902 starring [Minnie Maddern Fiske](/wiki/Mrs._Fiske \"Mrs.\nFiske\"), a 1937 adaptation with acting script by [Thornton\nWilder](/wiki/Thornton_Wilder \"Thornton Wilder\") and starring [Ruth\nGordon](/wiki/Ruth_Gordon \"Ruth Gordon\"), and a 1971 production starring\n[Claire Bloom](/wiki/Claire_Bloom \"Claire Bloom\").\n\nA new translation by [Zinnie Harris](/wiki/Zinnie_Harris \"Zinnie Harris\") at\nthe [Donmar Warehouse](/wiki/Donmar_Warehouse \"Donmar Warehouse\"), starring\n[Gillian Anderson](/wiki/Gillian_Anderson \"Gillian Anderson\"), [Toby\nStephens](/wiki/Toby_Stephens \"Toby Stephens\"), [Anton\nLesser](/wiki/Anton_Lesser \"Anton Lesser\"), [Tara\nFitzGerald](/wiki/Tara_FitzGerald \"Tara FitzGerald\") and [Christopher\nEccleston](/wiki/Christopher_Eccleston \"Christopher Eccleston\") opened in May\n2009.[33] In August 2013, Young Vic,[34] London, Great Britain, produced a new\nadaptation[35] of _A Doll 's House_ directed by Carrie Cracknell[36] based on\nthe English language version by Simon Stephens. In September 2014, in\npartnership with [Brisbane Festival](/wiki/Brisbane_Festival \"Brisbane\nFestival\"), [La Boite](/wiki/La_Boite_Theatre_Company \"La Boite Theatre\nCompany\") located in Brisbane, Australia, hosted an adaptation of _A Doll 's\nHouse_ written by [Lally Katz](/wiki/Lally_Katz \"Lally Katz\") and directed by\nStephen Mitchell Wright.[37] In June 2015, Space Arts Centre in London staged\nan adaptation of _A Doll 's House_ featuring the discarded alternate\nending.[38] 'Manaveli' Toronto is preparing to stage a Tamil version of _A\nDoll 's House_(ஒரு பொம்மையின் வீடு)on 30th June 2018, Directed by Mr P\nWikneswaran.[39]\n\n## Analysis and\ncriticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Doll%27s_House&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Analysis and criticism\")]\n\n_A Doll 's House_ questions the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-\ncentury marriage.[22] To many 19th-century Europeans, this was scandalous. The\ncovenant of marriage was considered holy, and to portray it as Ibsen did was\ncontroversial.[40] However, the Irish playwright [George Bernard\nShaw](/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw \"George Bernard Shaw\") found Ibsen's\nwillingness to examine society without prejudice exhilarating.[41]\n\nThe Swedish playwright [August Strindberg](/wiki/August_Strindberg \"August\nStrindberg\") criticised the play in his volume of essays and short stories\n_[Getting Married](/wiki/Getting_Married_\\(Strindberg\\) \"Getting Married\n\\(Strindberg\\)\")_ (1884).[42] Strindberg questioned Nora’s walking out and\nleaving her children behind with a man that she herself disapproved of so much\nthat she would not remain with him. Strindberg also considers that Nora’s\ninvolvement with an illegal financial fraud that involved Nora forging a\nsignature, all done behind her husband’s back, and then Nora’s lying to her\nhusband regarding Krogstad’s blackmail, are serious crimes that should raise\nquestions at the end of the play, when Nora is moralistically judging her\nhusband. And Strindberg points out that Nora’s complaint that she and Torvald\n“have never exchanged one serious word about serious things,” is contradicted\nby the discussions that occur in act one and two.[43]\n\nThe reasons Nora leaves her husband are complex, and various details are\nhinted at throughout the play. In the last scene, she tells her husband she\nhas been “greatly wronged” by his disparaging and condescending treatment of\nher, and his attitude towards her in their marriage — as though she were his\n“doll wife” — and the children in turn have become her “dolls,” leading her to\ndoubt her own qualifications to raise her children.
