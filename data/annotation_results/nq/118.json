There, she will await her reign once her\ngrandmother, Queen Clarisse, steps down as Queen. During Mia's twenty first\nbirthday party, she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding\na husband. She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas.\nDuring the course of the night, Mia's tiara falls off and is caught by a\nMember of Parliament, Viscount Mabrey, who secretly plans to steal Mia's\ncrown. While the Parliament is in-session the next morning, Mia stumbles upon\na hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in. Viscount Mabrey reveals\nhis nephew, Lord Devereaux, is another heir to the Genovian throne. Despite\nQueen Clarisse's objection, the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is\nif she marries within the month. Clarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at\nthe palace, while Mia is shocked to discover Lord Devereaux is actually\nNicholas. Mia's best friend, Lilly Moscovitz, surprises her by visiting.\nTogether, they pick through potential husbands. Mia eventually chooses Andrew\nJacoby, Duke of Kenilworth, and days later, they are engaged. Mabrey plans to\nhave Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve the engagement.\n\nFor a ceremony, Mia is to ride sidesaddle, but is inexperienced. Queen\nClarisse provides an [ancestral](/wiki/Ancestral \"Ancestral\") wooden leg decoy\nto make it look like she's riding sidesaddle. Mabrey spooks Mia's horse with a\nrubber snake, and Joe rushes to aid Mia, but accidentally tears off the wooden\nleg. Humiliated, Mia flees to the stables, where Nicholas fails to comfort\nher. At a garden party, Mia and Nicholas quarrel about Mia's relationship with\nAndrew; Nicholas tricks Mia into admitting she doesn't love Andrew.\nFrustrated, she argues, but instead gets bombarded by a kiss. At first, she\nkisses him back but then backs away. Nicholas pursues her even more, which\ncauses both of them to fall into a fountain. Queen Clarisse finally tells Mia\nthat her behavior with Nicholas needs to stop.\n\nDuring the Genovian Independence Day parade, Mia sees some boys harassing a\nlittle girl, and abruptly halts the parade to comfort the girl. Learning that\nthe children are orphans, Mia has a vendor give them all tiaras and lets them\nwalk with her in the parade. Everyone is impressed by her act of generosity,\nwhile Mabrey sees it as a political maneuver. Mia later decides to convert one\nof the royal palaces into a temporary children's center. That night, Mia has\nher bachelorette party, where Queen Clarisse surfs on a mattress and sings a\nduet with Princess Asana, one of Mia's good friends. In the meantime, Mabrey\nrealizes Nicholas has fallen for Mia, but Nicholas says that Mia will never\nlove him. Nicholas comes upon Mia as she is practicing her archery as part of\nher [coronation](/wiki/Coronation \"Coronation\") rites. He helps her succeed in\ngetting the arrow to hit the bullseye, something she had been struggling with.\nNicholas then informs Mia that he is leaving, but asks to see her just one\nmore time before he goes. She declines, saying she is under close guard.\n\nThat night, Nicholas appears outside Mia's window and asks her to come out.\nLilly encourages her to go, and Mia sneaks out. They ride out to a lake where\nthey share secrets, dance, and eventually fall asleep. They awaken to find a\nman in a boat videotaping them. Mia thinks Nicholas set her up, while he\ninsists he had no idea. By the time Mia returns to the palace, the scandalous\nfootage is already being broadcast. Andrew is disappointed and kisses Mia to\nsee if there is a romantic spark between them. They realize that they do not\nlove each other, but do not call off the wedding for the good of Genovia. The\nwedding is to take place the following day, and Mia's mother, Helen comes with\nher new husband, Patrick and their newborn son, Trevor. Nicholas decides\nagainst attending, but his surly housekeeper, Gretchen informs him that Mabrey\nengineered their televised scandal.\n\nBefore the wedding, Joe informs Mia that Nicholas is innocent. Queen Clarisse\nencourages Mia to follow her heart, something she has never done and has now\ncost her Joe, the only man she truly loved. Mia reenters the church, and after\npointing out how her grandmother has ruled Genovia while unmarried for a\nnumber of years, she tells the members of parliament in the audience to\nconsider the significant women in their lives and questions if they would have\nthem do what they're trying to force her to do (marry someone she does not\nlove). Mabrey cites the law again and once again suggests that his nephew be\nnamed King, but just then, Nicholas not only refuses the crown, but also\ndisowns Mabrey as his uncle. Mia proposes the law on royal marriages be\nabolished, and the Parliament unanimously gives its assent. Encouraged by Mia\nto have her own happy ending, Clarisse proposes to Joe and they are promptly\nmarried.\n\nAbout a week later, Mia is preparing for her [coronation](/wiki/Coronation\n\"Coronation\") when Nicholas shows up. He professes his love for Mia on bended\nknee, and they share a romantic kiss. The next day, Mia is crowned \"Her\nMajesty Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi, _Queen_ of Genovia\", with all\nin attendance in the royal palace.\n\nAn [epilogue](/wiki/Epilogue \"Epilogue\") shows that Genovian Parliament now\nallows female members, one of whom is Charlotte. And Queen Mia officially\nopens the children's home.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Princess_Diaries_2:_Royal_Engagement&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Anne Hathaway](/wiki/Anne_Hathaway \"Anne Hathaway\") as Princess/Queen Amelia \"Mia\" Thermopolis Renaldi\n  * [Julie Andrews](/wiki/Julie_Andrews \"Julie Andrews\") as Queen Clarisse Renaldi\n  * [Héctor Elizondo](/wiki/H%C3%A9ctor_Elizondo \"Héctor Elizondo\") as Joe\n  * [John Rhys-Davies](/wiki/John_Rhys-Davies \"John Rhys-Davies\") as Viscount Mabrey\n  * [Heather Matarazzo](/wiki/Heather_Matarazzo \"Heather Matarazzo\") as Lilly Moscovitz\n  * [Chris Pine](/wiki/Chris_Pine \"Chris Pine\") as Nicholas Devereaux\n  * [Callum Blue](/wiki/Callum_Blue \"Callum Blue\") as Andrew Jacoby\n  * [Raven-Symoné](/wiki/Raven-Symon%C3%A9 \"Raven-Symoné\") as Princess Asana\n  * [Kathleen Marshall](/wiki/Kathleen_Marshall \"Kathleen Marshall\") as Charlotte Kutaway\n  * [Jonny Blu](/wiki/Jonny_Blu \"Jonny Blu\") as himself\n  * [Tom Poston](/wiki/Tom_Poston \"Tom Poston\") as Lord Palimore\n  * Joel McCrary as Prime Minister Motaz\n  * [Kim Thomson](/wiki/Kim_Thomson \"Kim Thomson\") as Reporter Elsie Kentworthy\n  * [Larry Miller](/wiki/Larry_Miller_\\(entertainer\\) \"Larry Miller \\(entertainer\\)\") as Paolo Puttanesca\n  * [Caroline Goodall](/wiki/Caroline_Goodall \"Caroline Goodall\") as Helen Thermopolis O'Connell\n  * [Meredith Patterson](/wiki/Meredith_Patterson \"Meredith Patterson\") as Lady Elissa\n  * [Spencer Breslin](/wiki/Spencer_Breslin \"Spencer Breslin\") as Prince Jacques\n  * [Tracy Reiner](/wiki/Tracy_Reiner \"Tracy Reiner\") as Lady Anthony\n  * [Paul Vogt](/wiki/Paul_Vogt \"Paul Vogt\") as Lord Crawley\n  * [Paul Williams](/wiki/Paul_Williams_\\(songwriter\\) \"Paul Williams \\(songwriter\\)\") as Lord Harmony\n  * [Peter Allen Vogt](/wiki/Peter_Allen_Vogt \"Peter Allen Vogt\") as Mr. Crawley\n  * [Anna Netrebko](/wiki/Anna_Netrebko \"Anna Netrebko\") as herself\n  * [Abigail Breslin](/wiki/Abigail_Breslin \"Abigail Breslin\") as Carolina, the orphan child\n  * [Hannah Schneider](/wiki/Hannah_Schneider \"Hannah Schneider\") as Dancing Princess Hannah\n  * Charlee Corra Disney as Princess Charlee\n  * Aimee Adams Hall as Princess Aimee\n  * [Nadege August](/wiki/Nadege_August \"Nadege August\") as Princess Nadege\n  * [Claudia Katz Minnick](/w/index.php?title=Claudia_Katz_Minnick&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Claudia Katz Minnick \\(page does not exist\\)\") as Freda Kout\n  * [Stan Lee](/wiki/Stan_Lee \"Stan Lee\") as Three Stooges wedding guest\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Princess_Diaries_2:_Royal_Engagement&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nThe film opened in 3,472 theaters in [North America](/wiki/North_America\n\"North America\") and grossed $22,956,453 in its opening weekend.
