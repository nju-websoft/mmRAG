It was\nwritten as part of his 1992 solo album, _[Back to the\nLight](/wiki/Back_to_the_Light \"Back to the Light\")_. It was released as a\n[single](/wiki/Single_\\(music\\) \"Single \\(music\\)\") in late 1991, peaking at\n#6 on the [UK Singles Chart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\") and #9\non the [US Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart](/wiki/Hot_Mainstream_Rock_Tracks \"Hot\nMainstream Rock Tracks\").[1]\n\nBesides the original album/single version, there are three other known studio\nversions of the song. One was used in a [Ford](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford\nMotor Company\") commercial. The second is an [instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental\n\"Instrumental\") remix of the song, called _Driven by You Two_. The other known\nversion of this song has a new drum track from [Cozy Powell](/wiki/Cozy_Powell\n\"Cozy Powell\") as a bonus track on the US release of _Back to the Light_.\n\nShortly before releasing it as single, May played it on the [Guitar Legends\nconcert](/wiki/Guitar_Legends,_Seville_1991 \"Guitar Legends, Seville 1991\") in\nOctober 1991, having a super-group backing him: [Cozy\nPowell](/wiki/Cozy_Powell \"Cozy Powell\") on drums, [Neil\nMurray](/wiki/Neil_Murray_\\(British_musician\\) \"Neil Murray \\(British\nmusician\\)\") on bass, [Steve Vai](/wiki/Steve_Vai \"Steve Vai\") on rhythm\nguitar, [Rick Wakeman](/wiki/Rick_Wakeman \"Rick Wakeman\") and [Mike\nMoran](/wiki/Mike_Moran_\\(music_producer\\) \"Mike Moran \\(music producer\\)\") on\nkeyboards, [Maggie Ryder](/wiki/Maggie_Ryder \"Maggie Ryder\"), [Miriam\nStockley](/wiki/Miriam_Stockley \"Miriam Stockley\") and [Chris\nThompson](/wiki/Chris_Thompson_\\(English_musician\\) \"Chris Thompson \\(English\nmusician\\)\") on backing vocals. Many fans think this song is dedicated to\n[Freddie Mercury](/wiki/Freddie_Mercury \"Freddie Mercury\") because of the\nlyrics and the song title Driven by You.\n\nIt was released on 6 November 1991, just 18 days before the death of May's\nbandmate [Freddie Mercury](/wiki/Freddie_Mercury \"Freddie Mercury\").\n\nIt was used by the Ford Motor Company in advertisements for the [Ford\nProbe](/wiki/Ford_Probe \"Ford Probe\") and for the [Ford Escort RS\nCosworth](/wiki/Ford_Escort_RS_Cosworth \"Ford Escort RS Cosworth\"), in which\n[Miki Biasion](/wiki/Miki_Biasion \"Miki Biasion\") (a Ford rally driver at the\ntime) compared his rally car to the road-going version.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Track listing\n  * 2 Personnel\n  * 3 Credits\n  * 4 Appearances\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Track listing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driven_by_You&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Track listing\")]\n\nA. \"Driven by You\" (Producer – Brian May, David Richards) – 4:11  \nB. \"Just One Life\" (Dedicated To The Memory Of Philip Sayer)(Engineer – David\nRichards, Justin Shirley-Smith, Producer – Brian May) – 3:43\n\n## Personnel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driven_by_You&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Personnel\")]\n\n  * [Brian May](/wiki/Brian_May \"Brian May\") \\- lead and backing vocals, guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, drum programming\n\n## Credits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driven_by_You&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Credits\")]\n\n  * Design by Richard Gray[2]\n  * Photography by Brian May, Simon Fowler\n  * Written by Brian May\n\n## Appearances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Driven_by_You&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Appearances\")]\n\n  1.
