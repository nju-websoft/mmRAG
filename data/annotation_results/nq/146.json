It is most widely known for its use in creating\ncertain types of [sushi](/wiki/Sushi \"Sushi\").\n\nThe eggs are small, ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 mm. For comparison, tobiko is\nlarger than [masago](/wiki/Masago \"Masago\") ([capelin](/wiki/Capelin\n\"Capelin\") roe), but smaller than [ikura](/wiki/Ikura \"Ikura\")\n([salmon](/wiki/Salmon \"Salmon\") roe). Natural tobiko has a red-orange color,\na mild smoky or salty taste, and a crunchy texture.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Tobiko_on_grilled_Albacore.jpg/220px-\nTobiko_on_grilled_Albacore.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tobiko_on_grilled_Albacore.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tobiko_on_grilled_Albacore.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTobiko, shown in its natural color, topping grilled Albacore tuna\n\nSometimes tobiko is colored to change its appearance, other natural\ningredients are used to accomplish the change, such as [squid\nink](/wiki/Squid_ink \"Squid ink\") to make it black, [yuzu](/wiki/Yuzu \"Yuzu\")\nto make it pale orange (almost yellow), or even [wasabi](/wiki/Wasabi\n\"Wasabi\") to make it green and spicy. Sometimes a serving of tobiko contains\nseveral pieces, each having a different color.[2]\n\nWhen prepared as [sashimi](/wiki/Sashimi \"Sashimi\"), it may be presented on\n[avocado](/wiki/Avocado \"Avocado\") halves or wedges. Tobiko is used in the\ncreation of many other [Japanese dishes](/wiki/Japanese_cuisine \"Japanese\ncuisine\"). Often, tobiko is used as an ingredient in [California\nrolls](/wiki/California_roll \"California roll\").\n\nFrequently, masago ([capelin](/wiki/Capelin \"Capelin\") or\n[smelt](/wiki/Smelt_\\(fish\\) \"Smelt \\(fish\\)\") roe) is substituted for tobiko,\ndue to its similar appearance and flavor. The smaller size of the individual\neggs is apparent to the experienced diner, however.\n\n  \n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tobiko&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png) | Wikimedia Commons has media related to _**[Tobiko](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Tobiko \"commons:Category:Tobiko\")**_.  \n---|---  \n  \n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Tobiko vs Masago Difference\"](http://dougelniski.com/difference-between-tobiko-and-masago/). _Expert answer Question_. 2016-11-16.
