It was first presented as part\nof the television broadcast of the show in September 1984, was released as a\nsingle in 1985, and peaked at the number one spot on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\"). It was the last\n[instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental \"Instrumental\") to top the Hot 100 until\n2013, when \"[Harlem Shake](/wiki/Harlem_Shake_\\(song\\) \"Harlem Shake\n\\(song\\)\")\" by [Baauer](/wiki/Baauer \"Baauer\") reached number one.[1] It also\npeaked at number five in the UK and number four in Canada. In 1986, it won\n[Grammy Awards](/wiki/Grammy_Award \"Grammy Award\") for \"[Best Instrumental\nComposition](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Instrumental_Composition \"Grammy\nAward for Best Instrumental Composition\")\" and \"[Best Pop Instrumental\nPerformance](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Pop_Instrumental_Performance \"Grammy\nAward for Best Pop Instrumental Performance\").\" This song, along with [Glenn\nFrey](/wiki/Glenn_Frey \"Glenn Frey\")'s number two hit \"[You Belong to the\nCity](/wiki/You_Belong_to_the_City \"You Belong to the City\")\", put the _Miami\nVice_ [soundtrack](/wiki/Soundtrack \"Soundtrack\") on the top of the US album\nchart for 11 weeks in 1985, making it the most successful TV soundtrack of all\ntime until 2006, when [Disney Channel](/wiki/Disney_Channel \"Disney\nChannel\")'s _[High School Musical](/wiki/High_School_Musical \"High School\nMusical\")_ beat its record.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Versions\n  * 2 Music video\n  * 3 Track listing\n  * 4 Chart performance\n    * 4.1 Weekly charts\n    * 4.2 Year-end charts\n  * 5 Covers\n  * 6 Appearances\n    * 6.1 Episodes\n    * 6.2 Commercial\n    * 6.3 Radio\n  * 7 References\n\n## Versions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miami_Vice_Theme&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Versions\")]\n\n  * The 1:55-minute version that aired with the pilot. The famous synthesized guitar lead hook is absent from it, and it features distinct synth guitar notes in its midsection.\n  * The 0:57 version in the following 3 regular episodes, which only contains the percussion and keyboards, without the synth guitar hook. It was essentially a shortened version of the pilot, although it already featured the same melody progression and conclusion at its end as in all the later episodes.\n\nAccording to Jan Hammer's manager Elliot Sears, the missing guitar lead hook\nwas the result of the sound elements not being mixed together as Hammer\nintended.\n\n  * The 1:00 synth guitar hook version that aired with all later episodes. It was first introduced at the end of the first regular episode, _Heart of Darkness_ , over the closing credits, albeit with the guitar hook slightly more muted than in future episodes.\n  * The 2:26 full radio airplay version, the final 55 seconds of which are very similar to the 1:00 TV version.\n  * An extended dance remix, released in 1985 as a 12\" single containing two different length versions (in addition to the original version of the theme).\n\n## Music\nvideo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miami_Vice_Theme&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Music video\")]\n\nThe music video of the theme is a mini-episode of the TV series with Hammer as\na fugitive on the run from [James \"Sonny\" Crockett](/wiki/Sonny_Crockett\n\"Sonny Crockett\") and Ricardo Tubbs. Throughout the majority of the video,\nHammer performs the theme in front of a projector screen playing footage from\nthe TV series – including scenes of the Vice duo chasing him. In the end of\nthe video, he boards a helicopter and escapes from Crockett's sight.

When the series got picked up, Hammer\ncreated the 60 second version of the theme.

C., Radio Free D.C., with G. Gordon Liddy\".)\nLiddy had been a recurring guest on _Miami Vice_ during its run.\n\nEnglish radio presenter Paul Breeze adopted the tune to open his music shows\non Blackpool's Kit Kat Radio from 1996 to 1999 and, more recently, he re-\nadopted the tune for Paul & Lucy's \"Best Kept Secrets\" show—featuring what's\non news and interviews for the Blackpool area—on internet radio station Fylde\nFM during early 2010.\n\nIn the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\"), FM station\n[DWFM](/wiki/DWFM \"DWFM\") or Radyo Singko 92.3 News FM use the music as the\nbackground music for its morning news program \"Punto Asintado\" which is\npresented by [Erwin Tulfo](/wiki/Erwin_Tulfo \"Erwin Tulfo\") and [Martin\nAndanar](/wiki/Martin_Andanar \"Martin Andanar\").\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miami_Vice_Theme&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Weiner, Jonah (March 28, 2013).
