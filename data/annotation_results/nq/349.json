The\nFrench philosopher [Montaigne](/wiki/Montaigne \"Montaigne\") wrote of a dance\nhe saw in 1580 in [Augsburg](/wiki/Augsburg \"Augsburg\"), where the dancers\nheld each other so closely that their faces touched. Kunz Haas (of\napproximately the same period) wrote, \"Now they are dancing the godless\n_Weller_ or _Spinner_ \".[1] \"The vigorous peasant dancer, following an\ninstinctive knowledge of the weight of fall, utilises his surplus energy to\npress all his strength into the proper beat of the bar, thus intensifying his\npersonal enjoyment in dancing\".[2]\n\nThe peasants of Bavaria, Tyrol, and Styria began dancing a dance called\nWalzer, a dance for couples, around 1750. The [Ländler](/wiki/L%C3%A4ndler\n\"Ländler\"), also known as the Schleifer, a country dance in **3**  \n**4** time, was popular in [Bohemia](/wiki/Bohemia \"Bohemia\"),\n[Austria](/wiki/Austria \"Austria\"), and [Bavaria](/wiki/Bavaria \"Bavaria\"),\nand spread from the countryside to the suburbs of the city. While the\neighteenth century upper classes continued to dance the [minuet](/wiki/Minuet\n\"Minuet\"), bored noblemen slipped away to the balls of their servants.[3]\n\nIn the 1771 German novel _Geschichte des Fräuleins von Sternheim_ by [Sophie\nvon La Roche](/wiki/Sophie_von_La_Roche \"Sophie von La Roche\"), a high-minded\ncharacter complains about the newly introduced waltz among aristocrats thus:\n\"But when he put his arm around her, pressed her to his breast, cavorted with\nher in the shameless, indecent whirling-dance of the Germans and engaged in a\nfamiliarity that broke all the bounds of good breeding—then my silent misery\nturned into burning rage.\"[4]\n\nDescribing life in Vienna (dated at either 1776 or 1786[5]), Don Curzio wrote,\n\"The people were dancing mad ... The ladies of Vienna are particularly\ncelebrated for their grace and movements of waltzing of which they never\ntire.\" There is a waltz in the second act finale of the opera \"Una Cosa Rara\"\nwritten by [Martin y Soler](/wiki/Martin_y_Soler \"Martin y Soler\") in 1786.\nSoler's waltz was marked Andante con moto, or \"at a walking pace with motion\",\nbut the flow of the dance was sped-up in Vienna leading to the\nGeschwindwalzer, and the Galloppwalzer.[6][7]\n\nIn the transition from country to town, the hopping of the Ländler, a dance\nknown as Langaus, became a sliding step, and gliding rotation replaced\nstamping rotation.[5]\n\nIn the 19th century, the word primarily indicated that the dance was a turning\none; one would \"waltz\" in the [polka](/wiki/Polka \"Polka\") to indicate\nrotating rather than going straight forward without turning.\n\nThe Viennese custom is to slightly anticipate the second beat of each bar,\nmaking it sound as if the third is late and creating a certain buoyancy. The\nyounger Strauss ([Johann Strauss II](/wiki/Johann_Strauss_II \"Johann Strauss\nII\")) would sometimes break up the one-two-three of the melody with a one-two\npattern in the accompaniment along with other rhythms, maintaining the **3**  \n**4** time while causing the dancers to dance a two-step waltz. The metronome\nspeed for a full bar varies between 60 and 70, with the waltzes of the first\nStrauss ([Johann Strauss I](/wiki/Johann_Strauss_I \"Johann Strauss I\")) often\nplayed faster than those of his sons.[8]\n\nShocking many when it was first introduced,[9] the waltz became fashionable in\n[Vienna](/wiki/Vienna \"Vienna\") around the 1780s, spreading to many other\ncountries in the years to follow. According to contemporary singer Michael\nKelly, it reached England in 1791,.[10] During the Napoleonic Wars, infantry\nsoldiers of the King's German Legion introduced the dance to the people of\nBexhill, Sussex from 1804.[11]\n\nIt became fashionable in [Britain](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\")\nduring the [Regency period](/wiki/British_Regency \"British Regency\"), having\nbeen made respectable by the endorsement of [Dorothea\nLieven](/wiki/Dorothea_Lieven \"Dorothea Lieven\"), wife of the Russian\nambassador.[12] Diarist [Thomas Raikes](/wiki/Thomas_Raikes_\\(dandy\\) \"Thomas\nRaikes \\(dandy\\)\") later recounted that \"No event ever produced so great a\nsensation in English society as the introduction of the waltz in 1813\".[13] In\nthe same year, a sardonic tribute to the dance by Lord Byron was anonymously\npublished (written the previous autumn).[14][15] Influential dance master and\nauthor of instruction manuals, Thomas Wilson published _A Description of the\nCorrect Method of Waltzing_ in 1816.[16] [Almack's](/wiki/Almack%27s\n\"Almack's\"), the most exclusive club in London, permitted the waltz though the\nentry in the Oxford English Dictionary shows that it was considered \"riotous\nand indecent\" as late as 1825. Ann Bronte in 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' has\na scene set in 1827 where the local vicar Reverend Milward tolerates\nquadrilles and country dances but intervenes decisively when a waltz is called\nfor, declaring \"No, no, I don't allow that! Come, it's time to be going\nhome\".[17]\n\nThe waltz, and especially its closed position, became the example for the\ncreation of many other ballroom dances. Subsequently, new types of waltz have\ndeveloped, including many folk and several ballroom dances.\n\n## Variants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waltz&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Variants\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Waltz_dance_pattern.png/250px-\nWaltz_dance_pattern.png)](/wiki/File:Waltz_dance_pattern.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Waltz_dance_pattern.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nWaltz [rhythm].[18]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Jazz_waltz_dance_pattern.png/250px-\nJazz_waltz_dance_pattern.png)](/wiki/File:Jazz_waltz_dance_pattern.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jazz_waltz_dance_pattern.png \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Jazz waltz](/wiki/Jazz_waltz \"Jazz waltz\") rhythm.[18]\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, numerous different waltz forms existed,\nincluding versions performed in **3**  \n**4** , **3**  \n**8** or **6**  \n**8** (sauteuse), and **5**  \n**4** time (**5**  \n**4** waltz, half and half).\n\nIn the 1910s, a form called the **\" Hesitation Waltz\"** was introduced by\n[Vernon and Irene Castle](/wiki/Vernon_and_Irene_Castle \"Vernon and Irene\nCastle\").[19] It incorporated \"hesitations\" and was danced to fast music. A\nhesitation is basically a halt on the standing foot during the full waltz bar,\nwith the moving foot suspended in the air or slowly dragged. Similar figures\n([Hesitation\nChange](/w/index.php?title=Hesitation_Change&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Hesitation\nChange \\(page does not exist\\)\"), [Drag\nHesitation](/w/index.php?title=Drag_Hesitation&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Drag\nHesitation \\(page does not exist\\)\"), and [Cross\nHesitation](/w/index.php?title=Cross_Hesitation&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Cross\nHesitation \\(page does not exist\\)\")) are incorporated in the [International\nStandard](/wiki/International_Standard_\\(dance\\) \"International Standard\n\\(dance\\)\") Waltz Syllabus.\n\nThe **Country Western Waltz** is mostly progressive, moving counter clock wise\naround the dance floor. Both the posture and frame are relaxed, with posture\nbordering on a slouch. The exaggerated hand and arm gestures of some ballroom\nstyles are not part of this style. Couples may frequently dance in the\n[promenade position](/wiki/Promenade_position \"Promenade position\"), depending\non local preferences. Within Country Western waltz, there is the Spanish Waltz\nand the more modern (for the late 1930s- early 1950s) Pursuit Waltz. At one\ntime it was considered ill treatment for a man to make the woman walk\nbackwards in some locations.[20]\n\nIn California the waltz was banned by Mission priests until after 1834 because\nof the \"closed\" dance position.[21] Thereafter a Spanish Waltz was danced.\nThis Spanish Waltz was a combination of dancing around the room in closed\nposition, and a \"formation\" dance of two couples facing each other and\nperforming a sequence of steps.[21] \"Valse a Trois Temps\" was the \"earliest\"\nwaltz step, and the Rye Waltz was favoured as a couple dance.[22]\n\n  * In contemporary [ballroom dance](/wiki/Ballroom_dance \"Ballroom dance\"), the fast versions of the waltz are called [Viennese Waltz](/wiki/Viennese_Waltz \"Viennese Waltz\") as opposed to the [Slow waltz](/wiki/Slow_waltz \"Slow waltz\").[23]\n  * In [traditional Irish music](/wiki/Traditional_Irish_music \"Traditional Irish music\"), the waltz was taught by travelling dancing masters to those who could afford their lessons during the 19th century. By the end of that century, the dance spread to the middle and lower classes of Irish society and traditional triple-tune tunes and songs were altered to fit the waltz rhythm. During the 20th century, the waltz found a distinctively Irish playing style in the hands of [Céilidh](/wiki/C%C3%A9ilidh \"Céilidh\") musicians at [dances](/wiki/Ceili_dance \"Ceili dance\").[24][25]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/La_Valse%2C_Camille_Claudel.jpg/150px-\nLa_Valse%2C_Camille_Claudel.jpg)](/wiki/File:La_Valse,_Camille_Claudel.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:La_Valse,_Camille_Claudel.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWaltz, by [Camille Claudel](/wiki/Camille_Claudel \"Camille Claudel\") (1893)\n\n  * [International Standard Waltz](/wiki/Waltz_\\(International_Standard\\) \"Waltz \\(International Standard\\)\") has only closed figures; that is, the couple never breaks the embrace.\n  * The [American Style Waltz](/w/index.php?title=American_Style_Waltz&action=edit&redlink=1 \"American Style Waltz \\(page does not exist\\)\"), part of the [American Smooth](/wiki/American_Smooth \"American Smooth\") ballroom dance syllabus, in contrast to the [International Standard](/wiki/International_Standard_\\(dance\\) \"International Standard \\(dance\\)\") Waltz, involves breaking contact almost entirely in some figures. For example, the Syncopated Side-by-Side with Spin includes a free spin for both partners. Open rolls are another good example of an [open dance figure](/wiki/Ballroom_glossary#Open_dance_figure \"Ballroom glossary\"), in which the follower alternates between the lead's left and right sides, with the lead's left or right arm (alone) providing the lead. Waltzes were the staple of many American musicals and films, including \"Waltz in Swing Time\" sung by [Fred Astaire](/wiki/Fred_Astaire \"Fred Astaire\").\n  * The [Scandinavian](/wiki/Scandinavia \"Scandinavia\") Waltz, performed as a part of [Scandinavian folk dance](/w/index.php?title=Scandinavian_folk_dance&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Scandinavian folk dance \\(page does not exist\\)\"), can be fast or slow, but the dancers are always rotating.\n  * The [Peruvian Waltz](/wiki/Vals_\\(Peruvian\\) \"Vals \\(Peruvian\\)\") is called and recognised in Peru as _vals criollo_.\n  * The [Mexican Waltz](/w/index.php?title=Mexican_Waltz&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Mexican Waltz \\(page does not exist\\)\") (_vals mexicano_) follows the same basic rhythmic pattern as the standard waltz, but the melodies reflect a strong Spanish influence. Mexico's [Juventino Rosas](/wiki/Juventino_Rosas \"Juventino Rosas\") wrote \"[Sobre las Olas](/wiki/Sobre_las_Olas \"Sobre las Olas\")\" or \"Over the Waves\", commonly known in the U.S. as a circus song played during a trapeze show.\n  * The [Cajun Waltz](/w/index.php?title=Cajun_Waltz&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Cajun Waltz \\(page does not exist\\)\") is danced progressively around the floor, and is characterised by the subtle swaying of the hips and step very close to ordinary walking. It is danced entirely in the closed position.\n  * The Cuban (or Tropical) Waltz follows the pattern of the standard waltz throughout the song.\n  * The [Venezuelan waltz](/wiki/Venezuelan_waltz \"Venezuelan waltz\") provided a basis for distinctive regional musical composition.\n  * The Contra Waltz (Freeform Waltz), included in most [contra dance](/wiki/Contra_dance \"Contra dance\") evenings, uses both open and closed positions, and incorporates moves from other dances such as [swing](/wiki/Swing_\\(dance\\) \"Swing \\(dance\\)\"), [modern jive](/wiki/Modern_jive \"Modern jive\") and [salsa](/wiki/Salsa_\\(dance\\) \"Salsa \\(dance\\)\"). Basically the dancers progress around the dance floor with a waltz step, but with no constraints on what moves they can use.\n  * The [Valse Musette](/wiki/Bal-musette \"Bal-musette\"), a form of waltz popular in France, started in the late 19th century.\n  * The [cross-step waltz](/wiki/Cross-step_waltz \"Cross-step waltz\") (French Valse Boston) developed in France in the early 20th century and is popular in social waltz groups today.\n  * In folk dance from the [Alsace](/wiki/Alsace \"Alsace\") region, waltzes in odd metres such as **5**  \n**4** , **8**  \n**4** and **11**  \n**4** are found. In modern [bal folk](/wiki/Bal_folk \"Bal folk\"), waltzes in\neven higher metres are played and danced.\n\n  * [Estonian](/wiki/Estonia \"Estonia\") folk dance [Labajalavalss](/w/index.php?title=Labajalavalss&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Labajalavalss \\(page does not exist\\)\") (flat of the foot waltz) performed in **3**  \n**4** time.\n\nToday both the faster Viennese Waltz, made forever popular by the Strauss\nfamily, and the slower American and International style waltzes are extremely\npopular with dancers of all ages.\n\n  * [Sama'i](/wiki/Sama%27i \"Sama'i\") (also known as usul semai) is a vocal piece of Ottoman Turkish music composed in 6/8 metres. This form and metre (usul in Turkish) is often confused with the completely different Saz Semaisi, an instrumental form consisting of three to four sections, in 10/8 metre, or usul aksak semai (broken semai in Turkish). Semai is one of the most important forms in Ottoman Turkish Sufi music.[26][27]\n  * The **Tsamikos** ([Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\"): Τσάμικος, _Tsamikos_) or **Kleftikos** ([Greek](/wiki/Greek_language \"Greek language\"): Κλέφτικος) is a popular traditional [folk dance](/wiki/Folk_dance \"Folk dance\") of [Greece](/wiki/Greece \"Greece\"), done to music of [3/4](/wiki/Triple_metre \"Triple metre\") metre.[28]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Waltz&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Man_and_woman_dancing_a_waltz_%281887%29.gif/220px-\nMan_and_woman_dancing_a_waltz_%281887%29.gif)](/wiki/File:Man_and_woman_dancing_a_waltz_\\(1887\\).gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Man_and_woman_dancing_a_waltz_\\(1887\\).gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nMan and woman dancing a waltz by [Eadweard Muybridge](/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge\n\"Eadweard Muybridge\"). 1887.\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Nettl, Paul.
