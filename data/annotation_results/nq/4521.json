The Model X was designed to be an\nactivity-oriented vehicle combining features of a [pickup\ntruck](/wiki/Pickup_truck \"Pickup truck\") and a [sport utility\nvehicle](/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle \"Sport utility vehicle\").[4]\n\nThe Element was unveiled at the 2002 New York International Auto Show in March\n2002.[1]\n\nThe 4-seat Element is optimized to carry large volume loads, limited by total\npassenger and cargo weight not exceeding 675 lbs. The floor is made of easily\ncleanable TPO coated textured urethane; the fabric is stain resistant; the\nindividual rear seats recline, fold up, and are removable. The rear clamshell\ntailgate arrangement is large, and the vehicle is tall, allowing tall loads.\n\nThe rear side doors open outward from the front but are not referred to as\n[suicide doors](/wiki/Suicide_door \"Suicide door\"): they cannot be opened if\nthe conventional front doors are not open. To accommodate elimination of the\n[B-pillars](/wiki/B-pillar \"B-pillar\"), which provides unobstructed access for\nside loading through the 2006 model year, limited by the front seat design\nfrom 2007 onward, the Element features a chassis with reinforced joints,\nstrengthened lower side sills, larger cross members, enlarged rocker panels,\nand five bulkheads per side.\n\nThe compact SUV features a [2.4 Litre K Engine](/wiki/Honda_K_engine#K24\n\"Honda K engine\"), an i-VTEC [four-cylinder](/wiki/Straight-4 \"Straight-4\")\nengine producing 166 hp (124 kW) at 5500 rpm and 160 lb·ft (217 N·m) of torque\nat 4500 rpm and [front-wheel drive](/wiki/Front-wheel_drive \"Front-wheel\ndrive\") or an optional [all-wheel drive](/wiki/All-wheel_drive \"All-wheel\ndrive\") system — a hydraulically actuated system that operates only when front\nwheel slippage occurs, marketed as \"Real Time\" all wheel drive. The Element\nhas a towing capacity of 680 kg, or 1500 lbs.\n\nWith projected first year sales of 50,000,[2] the Element sold 67,478 units in\n2003 in the U.S.[5] By 2010, just over 14,000 were sold,[3] and by December\n2010, shortly before its discontinuation, it had sold a total of more than\n325,000 units.[3]\n\nIn 2007, the Element won the Dogcars.com \"Dog Car of the Year\" award because\nof its \"versatile cargo space, easy-clean flooring, crate-friendly rear design\nand optional all-wheel drive.\"[6] and in 2010 it won the \"Small SUV\" category\nas a \"Top Safety Pick\" in the [Insurance Institute for Highway\nSafety](/wiki/Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety \"Insurance Institute for\nHighway Safety\") Annual Awards.[7]\n\n## Model year\nchanges[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Model year changes\")]\n\n### 2003[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: 2003\")]\n\nThe 2003 Element was launched with two trim levels — DX and EX. All-wheel\ndrive models came with a large rear skylight.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] with\n160 hp.

The DX model was eliminated.\n[XM satellite radio](/wiki/XM_satellite_radio \"XM satellite radio\") and\n[MP3](/wiki/MP3 \"MP3\") capabilities were added as standard features in the\naudio system for the EX model. The charcoal gray plastic tone was darkened and\na navy blue was offered with the Satin Silver Metallic paint. Wheel covers on\nthe LX were changed to mimic the styled alloy wheels. Fuel economy was\nofficially 19 miles per US gallon (12.4 l/100 km) City, 23 miles per US gallon\n(10.2 l/100 km) Highway; 20 miles per US gallon (11.8 l/100 km) Combined[8]\n\n### 2006[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: 2006\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/2006_Honda_Element_EX-P.jpg/200px-2006_Honda_Element_EX-P.jpg)](/wiki/File:2006_Honda_Element_EX-P.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2006_Honda_Element_EX-P.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n2006 Honda Element EX-P\n\nA fully painted version called the EX-P became available for an extra US$500.\nIt came with a 5-speed [manual transmission](/wiki/Manual_transmission \"Manual\ntransmission\") or an optional 4-speed [automatic\ntransmission](/wiki/Automatic_transmission \"Automatic transmission\") with\n[overdrive](/wiki/Overdrive_\\(mechanics\\) \"Overdrive \\(mechanics\\)\").\n\n### 2007[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: 2007\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Honda_Element_EX_--\n_10-30-2009.jpg/200px-Honda_Element_EX_--\n_10-30-2009.jpg)](/wiki/File:Honda_Element_EX_--_10-30-2009.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Honda_Element_EX_--_10-30-2009.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n2007–2008 Honda Element EX\n\nThe 2007 Element received a mild refresh, which included 10\n[hp](/wiki/Horsepower \"Horsepower\") increase to 166 hp, along with a 5-speed\nautomatic transmission, and seat belts integral to the front seats allowing\nrear-seat occupants to exit the vehicle without a front occupant having to\nunbuckle.

The hood and grill were redesigned, the front fenders were\nnow all metal rather than painted composite material,[10] and the wheel arches\nwere squared off.[10] The moon-roof was no longer available for 2009-2011.\n\n### 2010[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: 2010\")]\n\nFor 2010, Honda Element came with LX, EX, EX with Navigation, and SC models.\nHowever, for all models the Element only came with 5-speed automatic\ntransmissions and no longer carried the manual transmission versions[11].\n\n### 2011[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: 2011\")]\n\nFor 2011, the Element no longer carried the SC model and the Royal Blue Pearl\ncolor was also cancelled. Honda discontinued the Element in early 2011.\n\n## Advertising and\nmarketing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Advertising and marketing\")]\n\n### Gil the\nCrab[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Gil the Crab\")]\n\nAfter a summer break, Honda decided to bring back a portion of the \"Element\nand Friends\" ad campaign, but with a focus on the [crab](/wiki/Crab \"Crab\"),\nwho was given the name Gil.[12] The most popular character from the ads with\nhis \"I Pinch!\" catch phrase, Gil had a [myspace](/wiki/Myspace \"Myspace\")\npage[13] to chronicle Gil's trouble with the law. In order to tap into [social\nnetworking sites](/wiki/Social_network_service \"Social network service\"),\nwhich began to play larger roles in ad campaigns in the mid-2000s, Gil was to\nmaintain a [blog](/wiki/Blog \"Blog\") and promote an [online\npetition](/wiki/Internet_petition \"Internet petition\") to save his job.[14]\nand endorse Gil paraphernalia through a [website](/wiki/Website \"Website\").\nThis led up to the launch of the new\n[commercial](/wiki/Television_advertisement \"Television advertisement\") dubbed\nElement TV, which premiered 28 September 2006, and rolled out with the new\nHonda Element SC which went on sale that same day.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Element and Friends - version\n2.0[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Element and Friends - version 2.0\")]\n\nIn the fall of 2006, the Element and Friends\n(<http://www.elementandfriends.com> website, now defunct) was re-launched with\nthe introduction of the new Element SC trim. The previous version had the\ndriving game using the Element EX-P (now simply called the EX) in a desert,\nsnow topped mountains, forests, and a beach. They now renamed that area \"above\nground\". A new second option from the main page allows you to select the\nElement SC to go \"underground\" in an urbanesque environment featuring a drive-\nin, central park with a basketball court, a seedy mainstreet, and project\nhousing. The six new SC friends include a rat, mole, hamster, pigeon, roach,\nand a dog. The drive-in serves as the venue to view the TV spots that feature\nonly the rat, mole, pigeon, and hamster. The format remains the same with new\nmini-games, but both maps now include a tunnel to venture above or below the\nsurface, through the mountain and building respectively. Changes to the above\nground include the removal of the previous TV spots from the website and a\nlink on the beach to Gil's Myspace page.\n\nRPA,[15] the company which created the Element and friends website, won the\n\"Best in Show\"[16] from MIXX Awards for the [microsite](/wiki/Microsite\n\"Microsite\"). They revealed that visitors average 15 minutes on the site.\n\n### Dog-friendly\nConcept[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Dog-friendly Concept\")]\n\n    _See \"external links\" below for dog-friendly concept car photo gallery._\n\nIn 2007, the Honda Element won the Dogcars.com's \"Dog Car of the Year\" award.\nHonda chose to follow up on that with a concept vehicle unveiled in 2009 New\nYork Auto Show specifically designed for canine transportation.[10] It\nincluded a pet restraint system, an extendable cargo area load-in ramp, a 12V\nDC rear ventilation fan, second-row seat covers with a simple beige dog-\noutline pattern design to match the bed cover fabric, all-season rubber floor\nmats with a toy bone pattern, a fan, and \"Dog Friendly\" exterior pawprint\nemblems. A spill-resistant water bowl, also included, could be placed into a\nnook in the corner of the pet bed.[10]\n\nThe second row pet restraint system was a small net crate suitable for cats or\nsmall dogs, which could be belted into place. It strapped directly to the\nlower portion of the seat and the captive animal could not see out the\nwindows, unlike the pet \"booster seats\" sold by pet-supply vendors\nspecifically designed to allow small dogs to see through the windows and sniff\nthe incoming airflow. The pet bed is a thick cushion for the whole of the rear\ncargo area. The cargo area pet restraint system consists of netting on the\nsides and the top of the dog bed, as well as a zip-up fourth side to be\nsecured after the dog is loaded.\n\nThe package was dealer-installed and retails for $1,000.[17]\n\n##\nDiscontinuation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Discontinuation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This article **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

In 2003 (the\nElement's introductory and most successful year), Honda sold more of the cars\nthan it did in the vehicle's final 3 years combined. Industry analysts and\nHonda executives blamed the Element's demise on a variety of factors:\ncompetition from similar vehicles offered by other manufacturers, rivalry\nwithin the automaker's own product line, and a dwindling market share for SUVs\noverall.\n\nWhen Honda unveiled the Element in 2003 the design was unique, and the no-\nnonsense philosophy and retro/progressive styling drew customers to the car.\nThe still emerging and relatively new market for compact SUVs offered little\ncompetition, and Honda was able to win over buyers by targeting the car toward\nyoung, active people with a list of options to suit outdoor activities like\nbiking and camping. Competing automakers quickly noticed the vehicle's\nsuccess, and the Element was quickly joined by similar vehicles such as the\n[Nissan Cube](/wiki/Nissan_Cube \"Nissan Cube\"), [Ford Flex](/wiki/Ford_Flex\n\"Ford Flex\"), [Kia Soul](/wiki/Kia_Soul \"Kia Soul\") and [Scion\nxB](/wiki/Scion_xB \"Scion xB\"). These other vehicles were similar to the\nElement and many of them were more affordable, which proved to be too alluring\nfor the young audience at which the car had been aimed. In addition to facing\nstiff competition from off the lot, the Element also had to cope with intense\nrivalry from within the Honda stable in the form of the automaker's flagship\n[CR-V](/wiki/Honda_CR-V \"Honda CR-V\"). The Element model line struggled in the\nshadow of this more well-established sister car. Adding to this was Honda\nexecutives' decision not to update the Element at all during the car's entire\n9-year production run, a decision that made the Element seem dull and dated in\na market sector that places an extremely high value on ultramodern\ncontemporary styling and state-of-the-art technology. The model's worst sales\nyear, 2009, saw the CR-V outselling the Element by a factor of 5 to 1.[18]\n[19]\n\nThe final model year for the car was 2011 and production ended that April.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Honda_Element&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [\"2002 New York International Auto Show in New York - Evolution of the Automobile\"](https://mpt.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/760009-evolution-of-the-automobile/2002-new-york-international-auto-show-in-new-york-evolution-of-the-automobile/#.Wc_6kWiPLqY). _PBS LearningMedia_.\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [\"Honda Adds New \"Element\" To Lineup\"](http://world.honda.com/news/2002/c020327_2.html) (Press release).
