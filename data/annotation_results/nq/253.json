Russo kills all of his targets\nbut Frank Castle, who survives the bomb that Russo had planted in Castle's\nhome.[4] Hours later, the [Punisher](/wiki/Punisher \"Punisher\") (Frank Castle)\ntracks Russo down to a [Maggia](/wiki/Maggia_\\(comics\\) \"Maggia \\(comics\\)\")\n[nightclub](/wiki/Nightclub \"Nightclub\"). The Punisher guns down all of\nRusso's associates, but leaves him alive to send a message to organized crime\nafter knocking him through a glass pane, an act that reduces Russo's face to a\n[jigsaw puzzle](/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle \"Jigsaw puzzle\")-like mess of scars.[3]\n\nTaking advantage of his hideous visage, the formerly handsome gangster adopts\nthe identity of Jigsaw, and attempts to frame the Punisher for murder.\nHowever, the plan fails due to the intervention of [Spider-Man](/wiki/Spider-\nMan \"Spider-Man\") and [Nightcrawler](/wiki/Nightcrawler_\\(comics\\)\n\"Nightcrawler \\(comics\\)\"); Spider-Man witnesses one of Jigsaw's murders, and\none of his victims is an old friend of Nightcrawler.[5][6] Jigsaw later\nbattled Spider-Man again.[7]\n\nIt is revealed in the first _Punisher_ miniseries that Jigsaw was behind a\nplan to drug the Punisher, causing his enemy to behave erratically and attack\nany criminals, even for things as minor as littering. Jigsaw also attempts to\nkill the Punisher in prison. The Punisher confronts and defeats him, and later\nstops Jigsaw from escaping in a prison riot.[8] Later in the series, Jigsaw is\nbrainwashed by the Trust into serving as a member of a Punisher-style\nassassination squad. He manages to remember who he is after encountering\nCastle once again, and attacks the Punisher. He is defeated once more.[9][10]\n\nJigsaw is broken out of Ryker's Island by the [Rev](/wiki/Rev_\\(comics\\) \"Rev\n\\(comics\\)\") who has him supervise the importation of a sterility-inducing\n[Venezuelan](/wiki/Venezuela \"Venezuela\") drug that the Rev intends to test in\nNew York City. When the drug shipment is destroyed by the Punisher, Jigsaw\nsics a street gang on him, and flees to Venezuela with the Rev. After Jigsaw's\nface is healed by the Rev's powers, he is shot by the Punisher, but\nresurrected by the Rev, with the assistance of\n[Belasco](/wiki/Belasco_\\(comics\\) \"Belasco \\(comics\\)\"). Jigsaw's restored\nface is destroyed, and he is left for dead in the jungle in a later battle\nwith the Punisher.[11][12][13][14][15][16] Jigsaw recovers, and subsequently\nattempts to illegally reenter the United States, but is arrested and returned\nto Ryker's Island. When the Punisher is captured by the authorities and sent\nto same prison, Jigsaw disfigures and tries to kill him, but the Punisher\nsurvives, and escapes from Ryker's.[17][18]\n\nAfter the Punisher is arrested and sentenced to death, Jigsaw dons a stylized\ncopy of his costume and embarks on a homicidal rampage, targeting all those\nconnected to the execution.[19][20] When the Punisher is revealed to still be\nalive, an overjoyed Jigsaw attempts to kill him, but the Punisher overpowers\nhim with the assistance of\n[Daredevil](/wiki/Daredevil_\\(Marvel_Comics_character\\) \"Daredevil \\(Marvel\nComics character\\)\").[21] Jigsaw later partners with various syndicates, and\nlays siege to the estate of the Geraci crime family, which the Punisher had\nbecome the reluctant [underboss](/wiki/Underboss \"Underboss\") of.[22] Jigsaw\nand his allies abduct the Geracis, but they are saved by the Punisher, who\nshoots Jigsaw in the head.[23]\n\nJigsaw next establishes a [gunrunning](/wiki/Arms_trafficking \"Arms\ntrafficking\") operation, which is broken up by Daredevil and [Black\nWidow](/wiki/Black_Widow_\\(Natasha_Romanova\\) \"Black Widow \\(Natasha\nRomanova\\)\"). When his attempt at negotiating with Daredevil (who had declared\nhimself the new [Kingpin](/wiki/Kingpin_\\(character\\) \"Kingpin\n\\(character\\)\")) fails, Jigsaw seeks revenge by breaking into Daredevil's\nhome, where he is subdued by Black Widow.[24] Jigsaw is remanded to the Raft,\nan island supervillain prison, which he escapes from (breaking Spider-Man's\narm in the process) when the facility is attacked by\n[Electro](/wiki/Electro_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Electro \\(Marvel Comics\\)\").[25]\nOnce free, Jigsaw tries to rob a bank, but is beaten by [Tigra](/wiki/Tigra\n\"Tigra\"). This humiliation leads to his forming an alliance with the self-\nproclaimed \"super-villain Kingpin\" the [Hood](/wiki/Hood_\\(comics\\) \"Hood\n\\(comics\\)\"); together, Jigsaw and the Hood film themselves threatening and\ntorturing Tigra.[1] Later, Jigsaw takes part in the Hood's attack on the\n[Sanctum Sanctorum](/wiki/Sanctum_Sanctorum \"Sanctum Sanctorum\"), where he\nattempts to snipe [Jessica Jones](/wiki/Jessica_Jones \"Jessica Jones\") and\nDanielle Cage, only to be foiled by Spider-Man.[26]\n\nJigsaw has resumed his vendetta against the Punisher, in the pages of\n_Punisher: War Journal_. Now wearing a color-inverted mockup of the Punisher\ncostume, Jigsaw arranges for the brainwashing of a young auxiliary police\nofficer in the NYPD. Exploiting the naive cop's pathological \"hero-worship\"\ncomplex, Jigsaw and his new psychiatrist girlfriend turn the young man into a\nnew version of the Punisher.[27]\n\nAfter a battle on the [Brooklyn Bridge](/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge \"Brooklyn\nBridge\") where the Punisher once again spares Jigsaw's life, Jigsaw is taken\ninto [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D. \"S.H.I.E.L.D.\") custody. While\nimprisoned he is seemingly shot dead by the man that he and his girlfriend\n(who was actually undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [Lynn\nMichaels](/wiki/Lynn_Michaels \"Lynn Michaels\")) had brainwashed.[28] Jigsaw\nsurvived the attempt on his life, and was transferred to a \"reprogramming\nasylum\" by [H.A.M.M.E.R.](/wiki/H.A.M.M.E.R. \"H.A.M.M.E.R.\")[29] He returns to\nthe Hood's Gang in _[Secret Invasion](/wiki/Secret_Invasion \"Secret\nInvasion\")_ to assist in fending off the invading [Skrulls](/wiki/Skrull\n\"Skrull\"), and rejoins again in _[Dark Reign](/wiki/Dark_Reign_\\(comics\\)\n\"Dark Reign \\(comics\\)\")_ to help attack the [New\nAvengers](/wiki/The_New_Avengers_\\(comics\\) \"The New Avengers\n\\(comics\\)\").[30][31]\n\nJigsaw then partners with the similarly disfigured [Stuart\nClarke](/wiki/Rampage_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Rampage \\(Marvel Comics\\)\").\nTogether, the \"Jigsaw Brothers\" hire [Lady Gorgon](/wiki/Lady_Gorgon \"Lady\nGorgon\") to impersonate Maria Castle while they manipulate Henry, the\nPunisher's ally and Jigsaw's son, into helping them capture and kill the\nPunisher. After betraying and murdering Clarke, Jigsaw battles the Punisher on\ntop of his own burning headquarters, only to fall through the roof of the\nbuilding and into the fire below.[29]\n\nJigsaw resurfaced when the pictures of he and Spider-Man were shown enjoying\nice cream cones together while under the thrall of [fairy](/wiki/Fairy\n\"Fairy\") king Oberoth'M'Gozz.[32]\n\nA recovered Jigsaw afterward appears in the _[Civil War II](/wiki/Civil_War_II\n\"Civil War II\")_ storyline as one of the criminals that the Kingpin has\nassembled to help him rebuild his New York empire.[33]\n\n## Powers and\nabilities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Powers and abilities\")]\n\nJigsaw is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. During his time in\nprison, he was able to hone his physical strength to a level comparable to the\nPunisher. He has extensive experience with street-fighting techniques, and\nfamiliarity with a variety of weapons and criminal techniques. He carries\nvarious handguns as needed. He has been known to wear a special exo-skeleton\nin his outfits.\n\nThough lacking any formal, military training, Jigsaw is an exceptional\nstrategist and tactician. His unorthodox pattern of operation makes him more\ndifficult for the Punisher to anticipate than the majority of Punisher's\nenemies. Before Jigsaw was disfigured, he was a highly-charismatic leader and\ncriminal organizer, but after the accident, only the latter trait\nremained.[34]\n\n## Other\nversions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Other versions\")]\n\n###\n2099[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: 2099\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2f/Jigsaw2099.jpg/150px-\nJigsaw2099.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jigsaw2099.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jigsaw2099.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJigsaw 2099, on the cover of _The Punisher 2099_ #10 (November 1993).

When the machine is turned on, its fail-safes\nactivate, and blast Jigsaw.[42] Jigsaw is later discovered, taken captive, and\nfurther augmented by a gang, which he massacres and escapes from before\nrejoining Fearmaster.[43]\n\n###\nCrossovers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Crossovers\")]\n\nJigsaw appears in both [Batman](/wiki/Batman \"Batman\")/Punisher [intercompany\ncrossover](/wiki/Intercompany_crossover \"Intercompany crossover\") books. In\nthe first crossover, Jigsaw allies with the [Joker](/wiki/Joker_\\(comics\\)\n\"Joker \\(comics\\)\") and they both fight the Punisher and [Batman (Jean Paul\nValley)](/wiki/Azrael_\\(comics\\) \"Azrael \\(comics\\)\").[44] In the sequel,\nJigsaw's face is repaired by one of the world's foremost plastic surgeons,\nextorted by the Joker, whom Jigsaw allies with again to take over Gotham. At\nthe end of this crossover, Jigsaw's reconstructed face is destroyed by one of\nthe Punisher's [fragmentation grenades](/wiki/Fragmentation_grenade\n\"Fragmentation grenade\"), and he is knocked out and left for the police by\n[Batman](/wiki/Batman \"Batman\") (Bruce Wayne).[45] Jigsaw and the Punisher's\nactivities in Gotham are later recounted by Azrael, and\n[Nightwing](/wiki/Dick_Grayson \"Dick Grayson\").[46][47]\n\nWhen the [Amalgam Universe](/wiki/Amalgam_Comics \"Amalgam Comics\") came into\nbeing as a result of the events of _[DC vs. Marvel](/wiki/DC_vs._Marvel \"DC\nvs. Marvel\")_ , Jigsaw was merged with [Wonder Woman](/wiki/Wonder_Woman\n\"Wonder Woman\") foe [Cheetah](/wiki/Cheetah_\\(comics\\) \"Cheetah \\(comics\\)\")\nto form \"Pelt-Man\"; cursed by an ancient ritual to resemble a [big\ncat](/wiki/Big_cat \"Big cat\"), Billy Minerva took his anger over his condition\nout on beautiful people, mutilating their faces until he was located and\nsubdued by Trevor Castle and Diana Prince.[48][49]\n\n### Earth\nX[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Earth X\")]\n\nAt some point, Jigsaw died, and was sent to the Realm of the Dead.

Jigsaw rejected Paradise and remained in the Realm of the\nDead, where he and the [Jackal](/wiki/Jackal_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Jackal\n\\(Marvel Comics\\)\") took to tormenting the Punisher, who had committed\nsuicide, and was living in blissful ignorance with his equally unaware family.\nJigsaw and the Jackal's actions cause the Punisher to remember his death, and\ndrive a wedge between him and his disbelieving loved ones, who only come to\naccept that they are dead much later.

When the families of the abducted and murdered women seek aid from\nthe Punisher, Jigsaw drives the crime fighter to suicidal despair by tricking\nhim into believing he had accidentally shot an innocent girl, though a last\nminute epiphany prompts the Punisher into exhuming and performing an amateur\nautopsy on the child, leading to the discovery that the bullet that ended her\nlife was not one of his own. The Punisher proceeds to destroy Jigsaw's Mexican\noperation and free his captives, and during a subsequent fight between the two\narchenemies the Punisher knocks Jigsaw out a window and onto the boxcar of a\npassing train, leaving his fate ambiguous.[51]\n\n[Bullseye](/wiki/Bullseye_\\(comics\\) \"Bullseye \\(comics\\)\") later researches\nJigsaw and other enemies of the Punisher, such as Barracuda, [Finn\nCooley](/wiki/List_of_The_Punisher_characters#Finn_Cooley \"List of The\nPunisher characters\"), and General Nikolai Zakharov.[52]\n\nJigsaw's role in \"Girls in White Dresses\" was regarded as generic and\nanticlimactic, and his inclusion in the [MAX](/wiki/Max_\\(comics\\) \"Max\n\\(comics\\)\") imprint criticized as obtrusive and gratuitous, by Jesse Schedeen\nof [IGN](/wiki/IGN \"IGN\"), who felt that the character was \"planted in this\nstory mainly to appeal to fans of [the recent movie](/wiki/Punisher:_War_Zone\n\"Punisher: War Zone\")\".[53][54]\n\n### Marvel\nNoir[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Marvel Noir\")]\n\nJigsaw is [Al Capone](/wiki/Al_Capone \"Al Capone\")'s top assassin in\n_[Punisher Noir](/wiki/Marvel_Noir \"Marvel Noir\")_.

After he left the Marines, Russo started Anvil, his own private military contracting firm.[58] In his youth, his mother was a meth addict and he was put in a foster home. Russo was nearly molested as a child, but he managed to defend himself.[59] He joined the Marine Corps and befriended Castle, who called him \"The Beaut\" due to his good looks. In reality, Russo and Castle are working for an illegal black ops program set up by [William Rawlins](/wiki/William_Rawlins \"William Rawlins\"). After a botched mission results in the deaths of several of their squadmates, Russo transfers out of the unit and suggests that Castle do the same.[60] In the present day, Russo is still friends with [Curtis Hoyle](/wiki/Curtis_Hoyle \"Curtis Hoyle\"), though he is unaware that Frank is still alive. DHS agent Dinah Madani begins interviewing and questioning Russo about his association with Frank, a person of interest in a case she investigated in Afghanistan.[61] Russo seduces Madani and enters a relationship with her,[62] but is irked when he learns that she is investigating Frank and that he is still living. He reunites with Castle and tries to persuade him to start a new life, but Castle refuses. However, Russo is revealed to be in league with Rawlins.[63] Russo and Rawlins plot to get rid of Castle and anyone who could link them to Kandahar. Russo kills Colonel Morty Bennett, who helped them smuggle heroin in the bodies of KIAs, after using him as bait for Castle.[64] Russo and several Anvil contractors are then tricked by Dinah into following a false lead on Castle with the intent to execute him, resulting in a shootout. However, Russo escapes after stabbing Dinah's partner Sam Stein to death.[59] Dinah, having learned the contractors were all working for Anvil, realizes Russo's complicity in Stein's murder when Frank shows up at a hotel to thwart an assassination attempt on [Karen Page](/wiki/Karen_Page \"Karen Page\") and Senator Stan Ori, who Russo is providing armed protection for.[65] Russo and Rawlins later capture Castle, but Russo double crosses Rawlins and leaves him at Frank's mercy.[66] He later has a showdown with Castle at the carousel where the latter's family died. The fight ends with Castle repeatedly slamming Billy's face into a carousel mirror, maiming him. Russo is last seen in a hospital bed with his head wrapped in bandages, with Castle being informed that Russo has suffered severe head trauma and blood loss, and may suffer serious memory loss if he ever wakes up.[67]\n\n###\nFilm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Film\")]\n\n  * Jigsaw was present in early drafts of the 2004 _[Punisher](/wiki/The_Punisher_\\(2004_film\\) \"The Punisher \\(2004 film\\)\")_ film,[68] and was going to be included in the unproduced sequel _The Punisher 2_.[69]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/War_Zone_Jigsaw.jpg/220px-\nWar_Zone_Jigsaw.jpg)](/wiki/File:War_Zone_Jigsaw.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:War_Zone_Jigsaw.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Dominic West](/wiki/Dominic_West \"Dominic West\") as Jigsaw in the 2008 film\n_Punisher: War Zone_.\n\n  * [Dominic West](/wiki/Dominic_West \"Dominic West\") portrayed Jigsaw in the 2008 film _[Punisher: War Zone](/wiki/Punisher:_War_Zone \"Punisher: War Zone\")_ , which changed the character's real name to **Billy \"The Beaut\" Russoti**. Russoti is introduced attending a mob dinner, which the Punisher attacks. Russoti escapes the ensuing massacre, but is pursued to his recycling plant, where he falls into a glass crusher, and is mangled when the Punisher turns the machine on. Billy survives, but his plastic surgeon is unable to restore his mutilated visage, stating that Russoti's facial muscles, tendons, skin, and bone structure were damaged beyond repair. After killing the surgeon, Russotti rechristens himself \"Jigsaw\". He then breaks his brother, James \"Loony Bin Jim\" Russoti, out of an asylum, to assist him in getting revenge on the Punisher. In the final battle at the Brad Street Hotel, Jigsaw is impaled and thrown into a fire by the Punisher.[70]\n\n### Video\ngames[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Video games\")]\n\n  * Jigsaw is a [boss](/wiki/Boss_\\(video_gaming\\) \"Boss \\(video gaming\\)\") in the 1990 _[Punisher](/wiki/The_Punisher_\\(1990_video_game\\) \"The Punisher \\(1990 video game\\)\")_ game for the [NES](/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System \"Nintendo Entertainment System\"),[71] and is the final opponent in the game's 1991 [Game Boy](/wiki/Game_Boy \"Game Boy\") port _[The Punisher: The Ultimate Payback!](/wiki/The_Punisher:_The_Ultimate_Payback! \"The Punisher: The Ultimate Payback!\")_[72]\n\n  * Jigsaw is a target in one of the missions in the 1990 DOS PC game _[The Punisher](/wiki/The_Punisher_\\(1990_computer_game\\) \"The Punisher \\(1990 computer game\\)\")_. Before the mission, [Microchip](/wiki/Microchip_\\(comics\\) \"Microchip \\(comics\\)\") informs Castle that Jigsaw and his accomplice, Mark Ruffknuckles, have escaped from Ryker's Island prison and were last seen at a seedy bar. The Punisher interrogates the bartender, who says Jigsaw and Ruffknuckles are hiding at the [Kingpin](/wiki/Kingpin_\\(comics\\) \"Kingpin \\(comics\\)\")'s former apartment. Castle kills Jigsaw's bodyguards at the apartment and confronts Jigsaw, who insults the Punisher: \"I haven't forgot what you did to my face, Punisher. Now you will suffer worse than I did. I'm gonna carve you up so bad, I'll look like [Mel Gibson](/wiki/Mel_Gibson \"Mel Gibson\") compared to you!\" The Punisher guns down Jigsaw, then Ruffknuckles, who is hiding in the bathroom. The Trust pays Castle well for killing Jigsaw.[73]\n\n  * In the 1993 _[Punisher](/wiki/The_Punisher_\\(arcade_game\\) \"The Punisher \\(arcade game\\)\")_ video game, Jigsaw is a sub-boss in the game's sixth and final stage, where he is fought inside of a moving elevator within the Kingpin's hideout, and is armed with an [M16 rifle](/wiki/M16_rifle \"M16 rifle\").[74]\n\n  * A character based on Jigsaw appears in the 2005 _[Punisher](/wiki/The_Punisher_\\(2005_video_game\\) \"The Punisher \\(2005 video game\\)\")_ video game, voiced by [Darryl Kurylo](/wiki/Darryl_Kurylo \"Darryl Kurylo\"). Here, Jigsaw is **John Saint** , the son of Howard Saint (the primary antagonist of the 2004 _[Punisher](/wiki/The_Punisher_\\(2004_film\\) \"The Punisher \\(2004 film\\)\")_ film and the man responsible for the death of Frank Castle's family). The explosion at the end of the film did not kill him, but instead launched him through a window and disfigured his face. Under the name Jigsaw, he takes up his father's old business, and vows revenge on the Punisher. He is also the lieutenant of a [Yakuza](/wiki/Yakuza \"Yakuza\")-offshoot called the Eternal Sun, and is the final boss of the game, using stolen [Stark Armor](/wiki/Iron_Man%27s_armor \"Iron Man's armor\") to attack the Punisher on Ryker's Island. Upon being defeated, Jigsaw is thrown out of a helicopter by the Punisher.[75]\n\n  * Jigsaw is a playable character in the [PlayStation Network](/wiki/PlayStation_Network \"PlayStation Network\") [downloadable](/wiki/Downloadable \"Downloadable\") game _[The Punisher: No Mercy](/wiki/The_Punisher:_No_Mercy \"The Punisher: No Mercy\")_ , released in 2009.[76]\n\n###\nToys[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Toys\")]\n\n  * In 2006, Jigsaw was one of the figures in the second wave of the [Marvel Legends](/wiki/Marvel_Legends \"Marvel Legends\") \"Face-Off\" series. He was paired with the Punisher and came in two versions, one with a business suit and one with a Punisher costume. The two-pack was released in December 2006.[77]\n\n  * In 2008, a minimates boxset was announced that is based on the _Punisher: War Zone_ film. The boxset features civilian Frank Castle (the Punisher), Jigsaw, and Loony Bin Jim, Jigsaw's mental, cannibalistic killer brother. The toys also come with mini weapons. They are sculpted and designed by Art Asylum and feature 14 points of articulation as well as accessories from the film.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n  * In 2009, [Hasbro](/wiki/Hasbro \"Hasbro\") released a Jigsaw figure in its [Mighty Muggs](/wiki/Mighty_Muggs \"Mighty Muggs\") toy line, which came with a silver pistol.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jigsaw_\\(Marvel_Comics\\)&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Brian Michael Bendis (w), Leinil Yu (p), Leinil Yu (i), Dave McCaig (col), RS and Comicraft's Albert Deschesne (let), Tom Brevoort (ed). \"The Trust, Part Three\" _The New Avengers_ #35 (10 October 2007), United States: Marvel Comics\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [Rick Remender](/wiki/Rick_Remender \"Rick Remender\") (w), [Tan Eng Huat](/wiki/Tan_Eng_Huat \"Tan Eng Huat\") (p), Tan Eng Huat (i), Dan Brown (col), VC's Joe Caramagna (let), Axel Alonso (ed). \"Dead End\" _The Punisher_ v8, #9 (16 September 2009), United States: Marvel Comics\n  3. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning (w), Dan Eaglesham (p), Scott Koblish (i), Colin Jorgensen (col), Bill Oakley (let), Don Daley (ed). \"Book Four\" _The Punisher: Year One_ #4 (March 1995), United States: Marvel Comics\n  4. **Jump up ^** Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning (w), Dan Eaglesham (p), Scott Koblish (i), Justin Gabrie and Colin Jorgensen (col), Jim Novak, Bill Oakley, and Susan Crespi (let), Don Daley (ed). \"Book Three\" _The Punisher: Year One_ #3 (February 1995), United States: Marvel Comics\n  5. **Jump up ^** Len Wein (w), Ross Andru (p), Mike Esposito (i), Glynis Wein (col), Irv Watanabe (let), Len Wein (ed). \"...
