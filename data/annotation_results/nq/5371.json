This\nphilosophy heavily influenced the writing of the United States Constitution,\naccording to which the [Legislative](/wiki/Legislature \"Legislature\"),\n[Executive](/wiki/Executive_\\(government\\) \"Executive \\(government\\)\"), and\n[Judicial](/wiki/Judiciary \"Judiciary\") branches of the United States\n[government](/wiki/Government \"Government\") are kept distinct in order to\nprevent abuse of power. This United States form of [separation of\npowers](/wiki/Separation_of_powers \"Separation of powers\") is associated with\na system of **checks and balances**.\n\nDuring the [Age of Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment \"Age of\nEnlightenment\"), [philosophers](/wiki/Philosopher \"Philosopher\") such as\n[Montesquieu](/wiki/Montesquieu \"Montesquieu\") advocated the principle in\ntheir writings, whereas others, such as [Thomas Hobbes](/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes\n\"Thomas Hobbes\"), strongly opposed it. [Montesquieu](/wiki/Baron_Montesquieu\n\"Baron Montesquieu\") was one of the foremost supporters of separating the\nlegislature, the executive, and the judiciary. His writings considerably\ninfluenced the opinions of the framers of the [United States\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\").\n\nStrict separation of powers did not operate in the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"), the political structure of\nwhich served in most instances as a model for the government created by the\nU.S. Constitution.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Under the UK [Westminster\nsystem](/wiki/Westminster_system \"Westminster system\"), based on\n[parliamentary sovereignty](/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty \"Parliamentary\nsovereignty\") and [responsible government](/wiki/Responsible_government\n\"Responsible government\"), [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom\n\"Parliament of the United Kingdom\") (consisting of the\n[Sovereign](/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Monarchy of the United\nKingdom\") ([King-in-Parliament](/wiki/King-in-Parliament \"King-in-\nParliament\")), [House of Lords](/wiki/House_of_Lords \"House of Lords\") and\n[House of Commons](/wiki/British_House_of_Commons \"British House of Commons\"))\nwas the supreme lawmaking authority. The executive branch acted in the name of\nthe King (\"[His Majesty's Government](/wiki/His_Majesty%27s_Government \"His\nMajesty's Government\")\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in\nmost cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government\nneeded to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One\nminister, the [Lord Chancellor](/wiki/Lord_Chancellor \"Lord Chancellor\"), was\nat the same time the sole judge in the [Court of\nChancery](/wiki/Court_of_Chancery \"Court of Chancery\") and the presiding\nofficer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three\nbranches of British government often violated the strict principle of\nseparation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different\nbranches of the government disagreed with each other.\n\nSome U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th\ncentury. In [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey \"New Jersey\"), the Governor also\nfunctioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding\nofficer of one house of the [New Jersey\nLegislature](/wiki/New_Jersey_Legislature \"New Jersey Legislature\"). The\n[President of Delaware](/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Delaware \"List of Governors\nof Delaware\") was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of\nthe two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive\ndepartment as [Vice\nPresidents](/wiki/List_of_Vice_Presidents_of_the_United_States \"List of Vice\nPresidents of the United States\"). In both [Delaware](/wiki/Delaware\n\"Delaware\") and [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"), members of\nthe executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand,\nmany southern states explicitly required separation of powers.\n[Maryland](/wiki/Maryland \"Maryland\"), [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\"),\n[North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina \"North Carolina\") and\n[Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._state\\) \"Georgia \\(U.S. state\\)\") all kept the\nbranches of government \"separate and distinct.\"\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Legislative power\n  * 2 Executive power\n  * 3 Judicial power\n  * 4 Checks and balances\n    * 4.1 Executive\n    * 4.2 Judicial\n  * 5 Equality of the branches\n  * 6 Views on separation of powers\n  * 7 Judicial independence\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Legislative\npower[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Legislative power\")]\n\n[![Seal of the United States\nCongress.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Seal_of_the_United_States_Congress.svg/100px-\nSeal_of_the_United_States_Congress.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Seal_of_the_United_States_Congress.svg)\n\n[Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") has the sole\npower to [legislate](/wiki/Legislature \"Legislature\") for the United States.\nUnder the [nondelegation doctrine](/wiki/Nondelegation_doctrine \"Nondelegation\ndoctrine\"), Congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any\nother agency. In this vein, the Supreme Court held in the 1998 case _[Clinton\nv. The city of New\nYork](/w/index.php?title=Clinton_v._The_city_of_New_York&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Clinton v. The city of New York \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ that Congress\ncould not delegate a \"[line-item veto](/wiki/Line-item_veto \"Line-item veto\")\"\nto the President, by powers vested in the government by the Constitution.\n\nWhere Congress does not make great and sweeping delegations of its authority,\nthe Supreme Court has been less stringent. One of the earliest cases involving\nthe exact limits of non-delegation was _[Wayman v.\nSouthard](/w/index.php?title=Wayman_v._Southard&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wayman\nv. Southard \\(page does not exist\\)\")_ 23 U.S. (10 Wet.) 1, 42 (1825).\nCongress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe judicial\nprocedure; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally\nclothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While [Chief\nJustice](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States \"Chief Justice of the United\nStates\") [John Marshall](/wiki/John_Marshall \"John Marshall\") conceded that\nthe determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he\ndistinguished between \"important\" subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote\nthat \"a general provision may be made, and power is given to those who are to\nact under such general provisions, to fill up the details.\"\n\nMarshall's words and future court decisions gave Congress much latitude in\ndelegating powers. It was not until the 1930s that the Supreme Court held a\ndelegation of authority unconstitutional. In a case involving the creation of\nthe National Recovery Administration called _[A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp.\nv. The United\nStates](/w/index.php?title=A.L.A._Schechter_Poultry_Corp._v._The_United_States&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. The United States \\(page does not\nexist\\)\")_ , 295 U.S. 495 (1935), Congress could not authorize the president\nto formulate codes of \"fair competition.\" It was held that Congress must set\nsome standards governing the actions of executive officers. The Court,\nhowever, has deemed that phrases such as \"just and reasonable,\" \"public\ninterest\" and \"public convenience\" suffice.\n\n## Executive\npower[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Executive power\")]\n\n[![Seal of the President of the United\nStates.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Seal_of_the_President_of_the_United_States.svg/100px-\nSeal_of_the_President_of_the_United_States.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Seal_of_the_President_of_the_United_States.svg)\n\n[Executive power](/wiki/Executive_\\(government\\) \"Executive \\(government\\)\")\nis vested, with exceptions and qualifications,[1] in the\n[President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\"). By law (Section 2.) the president becomes the Commander in Chief of\nthe Army and Navy, Militia of several states when called into service, has\npower to make treaties and appointments to office \"with the Advice and Consent\nof the Senate,\" receive Ambassadors and Public Ministers, and \"take care that\nthe laws be faithfully executed\" (Section 3.) By using these words, the\nConstitution does not require the president to personally enforce the law;\nrather, officers subordinate to the president may perform such duties. The\nConstitution empowers the president to ensure the faithful execution of the\nlaws made by Congress and approved by the President. Congress may itself\nterminate such appointments, by [impeachment](/wiki/Impeachment\n\"Impeachment\"), and restrict the president. Bodies such as the [War Claims\nCommission](/w/index.php?title=War_Claims_Commission&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"War Claims Commission \\(page does not exist\\)\") (created by the [War Claims\nAct of 1948](/wiki/War_Claims_Act_of_1948 \"War Claims Act of 1948\")), the\n[Interstate Commerce Commission](/wiki/Interstate_Commerce_Commission\n\"Interstate Commerce Commission\") ,and the [Federal Trade\nCommission](/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission \"Federal Trade Commission\")—all\n[quasi-judicial](/wiki/Quasi-judicial_body \"Quasi-judicial body\")—often have\ndirect Congressional oversight.\n\nCongress often writes legislation to restrain executive officials to the\nperformance of their duties, as laid out by the laws Congress passes. In\n_[Immigration and Naturalization Service v.\nChadha](/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service_v._Chadha \"Immigration\nand Naturalization Service v. Chadha\")_ (1983), the Supreme Court decided (a)\nThe prescription for legislative action in Art. I, § 1—requiring all\nlegislative powers to be vested in a Congress consisting of a Senate and a\nHouse of Representatives—and § 7—requiring every bill passed by the House and\nSenate, before becoming law, to be presented to the president, and, if he\ndisapproves, to be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House—represents\nthe Framers' decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government be\nexercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered\nprocedure. This procedure is an integral part of the constitutional design for\nthe separation of powers. Further rulings clarified the case; even both Houses\nacting together cannot override Executive vetos without a ​2⁄3 majority.\nLegislation may always prescribe regulations governing executive officers.\n\n## Judicial\npower[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Judicial power\")]\n\n[![Seal of the United States Supreme\nCourt.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg/100px-\nSeal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg)\n\nSee also: [Article I and Article III\ntribunals](/wiki/Article_I_and_Article_III_tribunals \"Article I and Article\nIII tribunals\") and [Jurisdiction stripping](/wiki/Jurisdiction_stripping\n\"Jurisdiction stripping\")\n\n[Judicial power](/wiki/Judiciary \"Judiciary\")—the power to decide cases and\ncontroversies—is vested in the Supreme Court and inferior courts established\nby Congress. The judges must be appointed by the president with the advice and\nconsent of the Senate, hold office during good behavior and receive\ncompensations that may not be diminished during their continuance in office.\nIf a court's judges do not have such attributes, the court may not exercise\nthe judicial power of the United States. Courts exercising the judicial power\nare called \"constitutional courts.\"\n\nCongress may establish \"legislative courts,\" which do not take the form of\njudicial agencies or commissions, whose members do not have the same security\nof tenure or compensation as the constitutional court judges. Legislative\ncourts may not exercise the judicial power of the United States. In _[Murray's\nLessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement\nCo.](/wiki/Murray%27s_Lessee_v._Hoboken_Land_%26_Improvement_Co. \"Murray's\nLessee v.

When the two houses of Congress cannot agree on a date for adjournment,\nthe president may settle the dispute. Either house or both houses may be\ncalled into emergency session by the president. The [Vice\nPresident](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States \"Vice President of the\nUnited States\") serves as president of the Senate, but he may only vote to\nbreak a tie.\n\nThe president, as noted above, appoints judges with the Senate's advice and\nconsent. He also has the power to issue [pardons and reprieves](/wiki/Pardon\n\"Pardon\"). Such pardons are not subject to confirmation by either the House of\nRepresentatives or the Senate, or even to acceptance by the recipient. The\nPresident is not mandated to carry out the orders of the Supreme Court. The\nSupreme Court does not have any enforcement power; the enforcement power lies\nsolely with the executive branch. Thus, the executive branch can place a check\non the Supreme Court through refusal to execute the orders of the court. For\nexample, in _[Worcester v. Georgia](/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia \"Worcester v.\nGeorgia\")_ , President Jackson refused to execute the orders of the Supreme\nCourt.\n\nThe president is the civilian Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the\nUnited States. He has the authority to command them to take appropriate\nmilitary action in the event of a sudden crisis.[2] However, only the Congress\nis explicitly granted the power to declare war per se, as well as to raise,\nfund and maintain the armed forces. Congress also has the duty and authority\nto prescribe the laws and regulations under which the armed forces operate,\nsuch as the [Uniform Code of Military Justice](/wiki/UCMJ \"UCMJ\"), and\nrequires that all [Generals](/wiki/General_\\(United_States\\) \"General \\(United\nStates\\)\") and [Admirals](/wiki/Admiral_\\(United_States\\) \"Admiral \\(United\nStates\\)\") appointed by the president be confirmed by a majority vote of the\nSenate before they can assume their office.\n\n###\nJudicial[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Judicial\")]\n\nCourts check both the executive branch and the legislative branch through\n[judicial review](/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States \"Judicial review\nin the United States\"). This concept is not written into the Constitution, but\nwas envisioned by many of the Constitution's Framers (for example, _[The\nFederalist Papers](/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers \"The Federalist Papers\")_\nmention it). The Supreme Court established a precedent for judicial review in\n_[Marbury v. Madison](/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison \"Marbury v. Madison\")_. There\nwere protests by some at this decision, born chiefly of political expediency,\nbut political realities in the particular case paradoxically restrained\nopposing views from asserting themselves. For this reason, precedent alone\nestablished the principle that a court may strike down a law it deems\nunconstitutional.\n\nA common misperception is that the Supreme Court is the only court that may\ndetermine constitutionality; the power is exercised even by the inferior\ncourts. But only Supreme Court decisions are binding across the nation.\nDecisions of a [Court of Appeals](/wiki/United_States_court_of_appeals \"United\nStates court of appeals\"), for instance, are binding only in the circuit over\nwhich the court has jurisdiction.\n\nThe power to review the constitutionality of laws may be limited by Congress,\nwhich has the power to set the jurisdiction of the courts. The only\nconstitutional limit on Congress' power to set the jurisdiction of the\njudiciary relates to the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court may exercise only\nappellate jurisdiction except in cases involving states and cases affecting\nforeign ambassadors, ministers or consuls.\n\nThe [Chief Justice](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States \"Chief Justice of\nthe United States\") presides in the Senate during a president's impeachment\ntrial. The rules of the Senate, however, generally do not grant much authority\nto the presiding officer. Thus, the Chief Justice's role in this regard is a\nlimited one.\n\n## Equality of the\nbranches[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Equality of the branches\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png) |  This section **possibly contains[original research](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research \"Wikipedia:No original research\")**.

However, [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison\n\"James Madison\") wrote in [Federalist](/wiki/Federalist_Papers \"Federalist\nPapers\") 51, regarding the ability of each branch to defend itself from\nactions by the others, that \"it is not possible to give to each department an\nequal power of self-defense. In republican government, the legislative\nauthority necessarily predominates.\"\n\nOne may claim that the judiciary has historically been the weakest of the\nthree branches. In fact, its power to exercise judicial review—its sole\nmeaningful check on the other two branches—is not explicitly granted by the\n[U.S Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States\nConstitution\"). The [U.S. Supreme Court](/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court \"U.S.\nSupreme Court\") exercised its power to strike down congressional acts as\nunconstitutional only twice prior to the [Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War\n\"American Civil War\"): in _[Marbury v. Madison](/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison\n\"Marbury v. Madison\")_ (1803) and _[Dred Scott v.\nSandford](/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\")_ (1857). The\nSupreme Court has since then made more extensive use of judicial review.\n\nThroughout America's history dominance of one of the three branches has\nessentially been a see-saw struggle between Congress and the president. Both\nhave had periods of great power and weakness such as immediately after the\n[Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") when republicans\nhad a majority in Congress and were able to pass major legislation and shoot\ndown most of the president's vetoes. They also passed acts to essentially make\nthe president subordinate to Congress, such as the [Tenure of Office\nAct](/wiki/Tenure_of_Office_Act_\\(1867\\) \"Tenure of Office Act \\(1867\\)\").\nJohnson's later impeachment also cost the presidency much political power.\nHowever the president has also exercised greater power largely during the 20th\ncentury. [Both Roosevelts](/wiki/Roosevelt_family \"Roosevelt family\") greatly\nexpanded the powers of the president and wielded great power during their\nterms.\n\nThe first six presidents of the United States did not make extensive use of\nthe veto power: [George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George\nWashington\") only vetoed two bills, [James Monroe](/wiki/James_Monroe \"James\nMonroe\") one, and [John Adams](/wiki/John_Adams \"John Adams\"), [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") and [John Quincy\nAdams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John Quincy Adams\") none. James Madison, a\nfirm believer in a strong executive, vetoed seven bills. None of the first six\nPresidents, however, used the veto to direct national policy. It was [Andrew\nJackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\"), the seventh President, who\nwas the first to use the veto as a political weapon. During his two terms in\noffice, he vetoed 12 bills—more than all of his predecessors combined.\nFurthermore, he defied the Supreme Court in enforcing the policy of ethnically\ncleansing Native American tribes (\"Indian Removal\"); he stated (perhaps\napocryphally), \"[John Marshall](/wiki/John_Marshall \"John Marshall\") has made\nhis decision. Now let him enforce it!\"\n\nSome of Jackson's successors made no use of the veto power, while others used\nit intermittently. It was only after the Civil War that presidents began to\nuse the power to truly counterbalance Congress. [Andrew\nJohnson](/wiki/Andrew_Johnson \"Andrew Johnson\"), a Democrat, vetoed several\n[Reconstruction](/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States \"Reconstruction\nera of the United States\") bills passed by the \"Radical Republicans.\"\nCongress, however, managed to override fifteen of Johnson's twenty-nine\nvetoes. Furthermore, it attempted to curb the power of the presidency by\npassing the [Tenure of Office Act](/wiki/Tenure_of_Office_Act_\\(1867\\) \"Tenure\nof Office Act \\(1867\\)\"). The Act required Senate approval for the dismissal\nof senior Cabinet officials. When Johnson deliberately violated the Act, which\nhe felt was unconstitutional (Supreme Court decisions later vindicated such a\nposition), the House of Representatives impeached him; he was acquitted in the\nSenate by one vote.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Grover_Cleveland%2C_painting_by_Anders_Zorn.jpg/155px-\nGrover_Cleveland%2C_painting_by_Anders_Zorn.jpg)](/wiki/File:Grover_Cleveland,_painting_by_Anders_Zorn.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Grover_Cleveland,_painting_by_Anders_Zorn.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Grover Cleveland](/wiki/Grover_Cleveland \"Grover Cleveland\") worked to\nrestore power to the Presidency after [Andrew Johnson](/wiki/Andrew_Johnson\n\"Andrew Johnson\")'s impeachment.\n\nJohnson's impeachment was perceived to have done great damage to the\npresidency, which came to be almost subordinate to Congress. Some believed\nthat the president would become a mere figurehead, with the [Speaker of the\nHouse of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Speaker of the United States House of Representatives\") becoming a _de facto_\n[prime minister](/wiki/Prime_minister \"Prime minister\"). [Grover\nCleveland](/wiki/Grover_Cleveland \"Grover Cleveland\"), the first Democratic\nPresident following Johnson, attempted to restore the power of his office.\nDuring his first term, he vetoed over 400 bills—twice as many bills as his 21\npredecessors combined. He also began to suspend bureaucrats who were appointed\nas a result of the [patronage](/wiki/Patronage \"Patronage\") system, replacing\nthem with more \"deserving\" individuals. The Senate, however, refused to\nconfirm many new nominations, instead demanding that Cleveland turn over the\nconfidential records relating to the suspensions. Cleveland steadfastly\nrefused, asserting, \"These suspensions are my executive acts ... I am not\nresponsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to submit my actions to them for\njudgment.\" Cleveland's popular support forced the Senate to back down and\nconfirm the nominees. Furthermore, Congress finally repealed the controversial\nTenure of Office Act that had been passed during the Johnson Administration.\nOverall, this meant that Cleveland's Administration marked the end of\npresidential subordination.\n\nSeveral 20th-century presidents have attempted to greatly expand the power of\nthe presidency. [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore\nRoosevelt\"), for instance, claimed that the president was permitted to do\nwhatever was not explicitly prohibited by the law—in direct contrast to his\nimmediate successor, [William Howard Taft](/wiki/William_Howard_Taft \"William\nHoward Taft\"). [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt\n\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt\") held considerable power during the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\"). Congress had granted\nFranklin Roosevelt sweeping authority; in _[Panama Refining v.\nRyan](/wiki/Panama_Refining_v._Ryan \"Panama Refining v. Ryan\")_ , the Court\nfor the first time struck down a Congressional delegation of power as\nviolative of the doctrine of separation of powers. The aforementioned\n_[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United\nStates](/wiki/Schechter_Poultry_Corp._v._United_States \"Schechter Poultry\nCorp. v. United States\")_ , another separation of powers case, was also\ndecided during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency. In response to many\nunfavorable Supreme Court decisions, Roosevelt introduced a [\"Court\nPacking\"](/wiki/Judiciary_Reorganization_Bill_of_1937 \"Judiciary\nReorganization Bill of 1937\") plan, under which more seats would be added to\nthe Supreme Court for the president to fill. Such a plan (which was defeated\nin Congress) would have seriously undermined the judiciary's independence and\npower.\n\n[Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\") used [national\nsecurity](/wiki/National_security \"National security\") as a basis for his\nexpansion of power. He asserted, for example, that \"the inherent power of the\nPresident to safeguard the security of the nation\" authorized him to order a\nwiretap without a judge's warrant. Nixon also asserted that \"[executive\nprivilege](/wiki/Executive_privilege \"Executive privilege\")\" shielded him from\nall legislative oversight; furthermore, he [impounded federal\nfunds](/wiki/Impoundment_of_appropriated_funds \"Impoundment of appropriated\nfunds\") (that is to say, he refused to spend money that Congress had\nappropriated for government programs). In the specific cases aforementioned,\nhowever, the Supreme Court ruled against Nixon. This was also because of an\nongoing criminal investigation into the [Watergate](/wiki/Watergate\n\"Watergate\") tapes, even though they acknowledged the general need for\nexecutive privilege. Since then, Nixon's successors have sometimes asserted\nthat they may act in the interests of national security or that executive\nprivilege shields them from Congressional oversight. Though such claims have\nin general been more limited than Nixon's, one may still conclude that the\npresidency's power has been greatly augmented since the 18th and 19th\ncenturies.\n\n## Views on separation of\npowers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Views on separation of powers\")]\n\nMany [political scientists](/wiki/Political_science \"Political science\")\nbelieve that separation of powers is a decisive factor in what they see as a\nlimited degree of [American exceptionalism](/wiki/American_exceptionalism\n\"American exceptionalism\"). In particular, [John W.\nKingdon](/wiki/John_W._Kingdon \"John W. Kingdon\") made this argument, claiming\nthat separation of powers contributed to the development of a unique political\nstructure in the United States. He attributes the unusually large number of\n[interest groups](/wiki/Interest_group \"Interest group\") active in the United\nStates, in part, to the separation of powers; it gives groups more places to\ntry to influence, and creates more potential group activity. He also cites its\ncomplexity as one of the reasons for lower citizen participation.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Judicial\nindependence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Judicial independence\")]\n\nSeparation of powers has again become a current issue of some controversy\nconcerning debates about [judicial independence](/wiki/Judicial_independence\n\"Judicial independence\") and political efforts to increase the accountability\nof judges for the quality of their work, avoiding conflicts of interest, and\ncharges that some judges allegedly disregard procedural rules, statutes, and\nhigher court precedents.\n\nMany legislators hold the view that separation of powers means that powers are\nshared among different branches; no one branch may act unilaterally on issues\n(other than perhaps minor questions), but must obtain some form of agreement\nacross branches. That is, it is argued that \"checks and balances\" apply to the\nJudicial branch as well as to the other branches—for example, in the\nregulation of attorneys and judges, and the establishment by Congress of rules\nfor the conduct of federal courts, and by state legislatures for state courts.\nAlthough in practice these matters are delegated to the Supreme Court, the\nCongress holds these powers and delegates them to the Supreme Court only for\nconvenience in light of the Supreme Court's expertise, but can withdraw that\ndelegation at any time.\n\nOn the other side of this debate, many judges hold the view that separation of\npowers means that the Judiciary is independent and untouchable within the\njudicial sphere. In this view, separation of powers means that the Judiciary\nalone holds all powers relative to the judicial function and that the\nLegislative and Executive branches may not interfere in any aspect of the\nJudicial branch. An example of the second view at the state level is found in\nthe Florida Supreme Court holding that only the Florida Supreme Court may\nlicense and regulate attorneys appearing before the courts of Florida, and\nonly the Florida Supreme Court may set rules for procedures in the Florida\ncourts.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] The State of New Hampshire also follows this system.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Constitution of the Roman Republic](/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Roman_Republic \"Constitution of the Roman Republic\")\n  * [Commander-in-Chief](/wiki/Commander-in-Chief \"Commander-in-Chief\")\n  * [Fourth branch of government](/wiki/Fourth_branch_of_government \"Fourth branch of government\")\n  * [Signing statement](/wiki/Signing_statement \"Signing statement\")\n  * [The Imperial Presidency](/wiki/The_Imperial_Presidency \"The Imperial Presidency\")\n  * [Unitary executive theory](/wiki/Unitary_executive_theory \"Unitary executive theory\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  * Davis, Zoe (2001).
