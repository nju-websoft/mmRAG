Reese Candy\nCompany[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reese%27s_Peanut_Butter_Cups&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: The H.B. Reese Candy Company\")]\n\n**The Harry Burnett Reese Candy Co.** was established in the basement of\nReese's house in [Hershey, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Hershey,_Pennsylvania \"Hershey,\nPennsylvania\").[2] Reese had originally worked at a Hershey dairy farm, and\nfrom the start he used Hershey Chocolate in his confections. Reese's Peanut\nButter Cups were his most popular candy, and Reese eventually discontinued his\nother lines.\n\nReese died on May 16, 1956, passing the company to his six sons, Robert, John,\nEd, Ralph, Harry, and Charles Richard Reese. On July 2, 1963, the Reese\nbrothers merged the H.B. Reese Candy Company with the Hershey Chocolate\nCorporation in a tax-free stock-for-stock merger with the six Reese brothers\nreceiving 666,316 Hershey common shares, valued in 1963 at $23.5 million. In\n2017, after 54 years of stock splits, those original shares now represent\nsixteen million Hershey common shares valued in excess of $1.7 billion, paying\n$42 million in annual cash dividends.[3] The H.B. Reese Candy Company is\nmaintained as a subsidiary of Hershey because the Reese plant workforce is not\nunionized, unlike the main Hershey plant. As of September 20, 2012, Reese's is\nthe best-selling candy brand in the United States with sales of $2.603\nbillion, and is the fourth-best-selling candy brand globally with sales of\n$2.679 billion—only $76 million (2.8%) of its sales are from outside the\nUnited States market. Additionally, the H.B. Reese Candy Company manufactures\nthe [Kit Kat](/wiki/Kit_Kat \"Kit Kat\") in the United States, which had 2012\nU.S. sales of $948 million.[4]\n\n##\nVariations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reese%27s_Peanut_Butter_Cups&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Variations\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Reeses-PB-Cups-Size-\nTrio.jpg/250px-Reeses-PB-Cups-Size-Trio.jpg)](/wiki/File:Reeses-PB-Cups-Size-\nTrio.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Reeses-PB-Cups-Size-Trio.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA trio of different sized cups.

Featuring peanut butter-flavored [nougat](/wiki/Nougat \"Nougat\")\nwith a chocolate coating, it has been likened to a peanut butter-flavored [3\nMusketeers](/wiki/3_Musketeers_\\(confectionery\\) \"3 Musketeers\n\\(confectionery\\)\") candy bar owned by [Mars,\nIncorporated](/wiki/Mars,_Incorporated \"Mars, Incorporated\").[8]\n\nHershey also produces several \"pantry\" items under the Reese's brand, such as\nReese's peanut butter chips (analogous to [chocolate\nchips](/wiki/Chocolate_chip \"Chocolate chip\") for baking), Reese's premier\nbaking pieces (tiny cup-shaped pieces of chocolate filled with peanut-butter,\nalso for baking), Reese's jarred peanut butter, and Reese's toppings\n(including peanut butter syrup, peanut butter and chocolate topping, and\nReese's [Magic Shell](/wiki/Magic_Shell \"Magic Shell\")) and\n[sprinkles](/wiki/Sprinkles \"Sprinkles\") for [ice cream](/wiki/Ice_cream \"Ice\ncream\").\n\nFor the July 2008 release of the [Batman](/wiki/Batman \"Batman\") feature film\n_[The Dark Knight](/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_\\(film\\) \"The Dark Knight \\(film\\)\")_\n, Reese's released two limited time products: blue and black Reese's Pieces\nwith Batman's likeness on the packaging, and Reese's peanut butter-filled\nchocolate Batman logos which were sold individually and roughly the size of\ntwo Reese's cups combined.[9][10]\n\nThe fact that Reese Sticks digressed from the normal Reese's naming pattern\nwas pointed out by Paul Lukas in his zine _Beer Frame_.[11] As Lukas noted,\neven though the official name was Reese Sticks, most people he casually\nsurveyed pronounced it unknowingly as _Reese 's Sticks_. In 2009, Hershey's\nchanged the name officially to _Reese 's Sticks_.\n\n### Holiday\neditions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reese%27s_Peanut_Butter_Cups&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Holiday editions\")]\n\nDuring the seasons when retailers offer holiday-themed candies, Reese's Peanut\nButter candies are available in various shapes that still offer the standard\nconfection theme of the traditional Reese's cup (peanut butter contained in a\nchocolate shell). They are sold in a 6-pack packaging configuration but are\nusually available individually. Although exterior packaging is altered to\nreflect the theme of the representative holiday, the actual holiday itself is\nnever presented.[12]\n\n**Reese 's Peanut Butter Hearts**\n\nAvailable mainly during January and February, these are heart-shaped\nconfections representing [Valentine's Day](/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day\n\"Valentine's Day\"). At various retailers, an individually-packaged, larger\nheart is available as well. These are packaged in all-red exterior packaging.\n\n**Reese 's Peanut Butter Eggs**\n\nAvailable mainly during March and April, these are egg-shaped confections\nrepresenting [Easter](/wiki/Easter \"Easter\"). Exterior packaging is usually\nyellow and orange (milk chocolate), white and orange (white chocolate), or\ndark brown and orange (fudge-flavored chocolate). This is the only holiday-\nthemed item available in three various chocolate varieties.[13] A larger,\nindividually-packaged [Easter Bunny](/wiki/Easter_Bunny \"Easter Bunny\")\nReese's peanut butter item, known as Reester Bunny, is available as well.\nAlso, Reese's Pieces are offered in Pastel Eggs.\n\n**Reese 's Peanut Butter Pumpkins**\n\nAvailable mainly during September and October, these are pumpkin-shaped\nconfections representing [Halloween](/wiki/Halloween \"Halloween\"). The\npackaging is standard Reese's orange with a [jack-o-lantern](/wiki/Jack-o-\nlantern \"Jack-o-lantern\") picture and the word \"Pumpkins\" prominently\ndisplayed.\n\n**Reese 's Peanut Butter Ghosts**\n\nAvailable mainly during September and October, these are ghost-shaped\nconfections representing [Halloween](/wiki/Halloween \"Halloween\"). The\npackaging is Halloween themed with the word scary on it. The ghost replaces\nthe letter \"a\" in the word scary. First released in 2016.\n\n**Reese 's Peanut Butter Christmas Trees**\n\nAvailable mainly during November and December, these are evergreen tree-shaped\nconfections representing [Christmas](/wiki/Christmas \"Christmas\"). At various\nretailers these may be available in standard milk chocolate or white.\nInitially, the packaging was green, white, and orange, but has been changed to\na winter scene with a snow-covered ground and a snowman with a central large\norange evergreen tree-shape in the center of the package. Another product\noffered is Reese's Peanut Butter Bells, which offers miniature Reese's cups in\na Christmas bell shape. A third product is a milk chocolate-covered Reese's\nSnowman, wrapped in a snowman foil. The peanut butter snowman is three times\nlarger than the peanut butter tree, egg or pumpkin.[14]\n\nIn December 2005, it was noted that some of the holiday shaped Reese's candies\n(such as the Bells) contain [gluten](/wiki/Gluten \"Gluten\"), unlike the\nstandard peanut butter cups.[15]\n\nIn November 2015, consumers criticized the product via [Twitter](/wiki/Twitter\n\"Twitter\") for bearing too vague a resemblance to a Christmas tree.[16]\n\n### Licensed\nfoods[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reese%27s_Peanut_Butter_Cups&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Licensed foods\")]\n\nHershey licenses the Reese's brand (name, [logo](/wiki/Logo \"Logo\"), etc.) to\nvarious companies for the production of other products beyond the traditional\nrealm of candy. For example, [General Mills](/wiki/General_Mills \"General\nMills\") produces [Reese's Puffs](/wiki/Reese%27s_Puffs \"Reese's Puffs\"), a\nbrand of peanut butter and chocolate flavored [breakfast\ncereal](/wiki/Breakfast_cereal \"Breakfast cereal\"). Several companies,\nincluding [Breyers](/wiki/Breyers \"Breyers\"), [Baskin-Robbins](/wiki/Baskin-\nRobbins \"Baskin-Robbins\"), and [Dairy Queen](/wiki/Dairy_Queen \"Dairy Queen\"),\nproduce various licensed Reese's ice cream products.\n\n## Marketing and\nadvertising[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reese%27s_Peanut_Butter_Cups&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Marketing and advertising\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/53/Reese%27s_logo.svg/220px-\nReese%27s_logo.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Reese%27s_logo.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Reese%27s_logo.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Reese's logo\n\nIn the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), Reese's Peanut\nButter Cups typically come in packs of 2, 4, 5, 10 or 20 in distinctive orange\npackaging, set on thin but rigid [paperboard](/wiki/Paperboard \"Paperboard\")\ntrays. The \"Classic\" two-pack is a 0.75 oz. cup since 2001 (originally a 0.9\noz. size, reduced to 0.8 oz. in 1991), the \"King Size\" four-pack introduced in\nthe early 1980s is a 0.7 oz. cup (originally a 0.8 oz. cup until 1991) and the\n\"Lunch\" eight-pack is a 0.55 oz. cup. \"Large Size\" packs of three 0.7 oz.\ncups, as well as bags containing 0.6 oz. cups, are also available. The \"mini\"\ncups come in various bag sizes and foil colors for seasonal themes like red,\ngold and green for the Christmas holiday season. In [Canada](/wiki/Canada\n\"Canada\"), where they are packaged as **Reese Peanut Butter Cups** (except\nReese's pieces), but still widely referred to by their American name, they\ncome in a standard pack of three 0.55 oz. cups or the king-size variation with\nfour cups. In the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") and\n[Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\"), they were\noriginally available only in two-packs, though are now only available in\nthree-packs, imported from Canada. In 2008 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were\nmade available in [Europe](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\") by [Hydro\nTexaco](/wiki/Hydro_Texaco \"Hydro Texaco\") and [7-Eleven](/wiki/7-Eleven\n\"7-Eleven\"). In Australia, Reese's products can be found in many specialty\ncandy stores, as well as from American stores such as [Costco](/wiki/Costco\n\"Costco\").\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a series of commercials were run for Reese's Peanut\nButter Cups featuring situations in which two people, one eating [peanut\nbutter](/wiki/Peanut_butter \"Peanut butter\") and one eating\n[chocolate](/wiki/Chocolate \"Chocolate\"), collided. One person would exclaim,\n\"You got your peanut butter on my chocolate!\" and the other would exclaim,\n\"You got your chocolate in my peanut butter!\". They would then sample the\nmixture and remark on the great taste, tying in with the [slogan](/wiki/Slogan\n\"Slogan\") \"Two great tastes that taste great together.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, the product's slogan was: \"There's no wrong way to eat a\nReese's.\" The current slogan, introduced in the mid-2000s, is: \"Perfect\".\n\nReese's was an associate sponsor of [Monster Energy NASCAR Cup\nSeries](/wiki/Monster_Energy_NASCAR_Cup_Series \"Monster Energy NASCAR Cup\nSeries\") drivers [Mark Martin](/wiki/Mark_Martin \"Mark Martin\") (1994), and\n[Kevin Harvick](/wiki/Kevin_Harvick \"Kevin Harvick\") (2007–2010).\n\n##\nCriticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reese%27s_Peanut_Butter_Cups&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Criticism\")]\n\nReese's Peanut Butter Cups are made with the controversial ingredient PGPR\n([Polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/wiki/Polyglycerol_polyricinoleate\n\"Polyglycerol polyricinoleate\"), E476, a.k.a. Palsgaard 4150),[17] which is\nused as a replacement for [cocoa butter](/wiki/Cocoa_butter \"Cocoa\nbutter\").[18] The FDA has determined it to be \"safe for humans as long as you\nrestrict your intake to 7.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reese%27s_Peanut_Butter_Cups&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of peanut dishes](/wiki/List_of_peanut_dishes \"List of peanut dishes\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Reese%27s_Peanut_Butter_Cups&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** <https://www.thehersheycompany.com/en_us/products.html?i=1;q=cups;q1=REESE%27S;sp_c=1000;sp_cs=UTF-8;sp_k=c_CorporateProducts;sp_s=PLBrand;sp_t=Corporate-US;view=xml;x1=PLBrand>\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"Hershey Community Archives\"](http://www.hersheyarchives.org/).
