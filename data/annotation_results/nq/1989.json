Paint application requires preparation and primer\nsteps to ensure proper application. A basecoat is applied after the primer\npaint is applied. Following this, a clearcoat of paint may be applied that\nforms a glossy and transparent coating. The clearcoat layer must be able to\nwithstand [UV light](/wiki/Ultraviolet \"Ultraviolet\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Processes and coatings\n    * 2.1 Preparation\n    * 2.2 Primer\n    * 2.3 Basecoat\n    * 2.4 Clearcoat\n  * 3 References\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_paint&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nIn the early days of the automobile industry, paint was applied manually and\ndried for weeks at room temperature. As mass production of cars started, paint\nwas dried in ovens. Nowadays, paint is usually applied by [robotic\narms](/wiki/Robot \"Robot\") and dried in just a few hours.\n\nUntil several decades ago [lead](/wiki/Lead \"Lead\"), [chromium](/wiki/Chromium\n\"Chromium\") and other [heavy metals](/wiki/Heavy_metals \"Heavy metals\") were\nused in automotive paint. [Environmental laws](/wiki/Environmental_laws\n\"Environmental laws\") have prohibited this, which has resulted in a move to\nwater-based paints. Up to 85% of lacquer paint can evaporate into the air,\npolluting the atmosphere. Enamel paint is better for the environment and has\nbecome the most widely used paint.[1]\n\n## Processes and\ncoatings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_paint&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Processes and coatings\")]\n\n###\nPreparation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_paint&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Preparation\")]\n\nHigh-pressure water spray jets are directed to the body. Without proper\npretreatment, premature failure of the finish system can almost be guaranteed.\nA phosphate coat is necessary to protect the body against corrosion effects\nand prepares the surface for the E-Coat.\n\nThe body is dipped into the Electro-Coat Paint Operation (ELPO/E-Coat), then a\nhigh voltage is applied. The body works as a cathode and the paint as an anode\nsticking on the body surface. It is an eco-friendly painting process. In\nE-Coat, also called CED paint, utilization is approximately 99.9% and has\ngreat [salt spray test](/wiki/Salt_spray_test \"Salt spray test\") life compared\nto other painting processes.[3]\n\n### Primer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_paint&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Primer\")]\n\nSee also: [Primer (paint)](/wiki/Primer_\\(paint\\) \"Primer \\(paint\\)\")\n\nThe primer is the first coat to be applied. The main functions of the primer\nare to act as a leveler and protector, and to make the base coat easier to\napply to the component to which it is applied. The primer serves several\npurposes. It serves as a leveler, which is important since the cab often has\nmarks and other forms of surface defect after being manufactured in the body\nshop. A smoother surface is created by leveling out these defects and\ntherefore a better final product. It serves as a protector, the primer will\nprotect from corrosion, heat differences, bumps, stone-chips, UV-light, etc.\nIt also improves ease of application by making it easier for paints to stick\nto the surface, a more varied range of paints can be used.\n\n### Basecoat[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_paint&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Basecoat\")]\n\nThe base coat is applied after the primer coat. This coat contains the visual\nproperties of color and effects, and is usually the one referred to as the\npaint. Base coat used in automotive applications is commonly divided into\nthree categories: solid, metallic, and pearlescent pigments.\n\n  * **Solid paints** have no sparkle effects except the color. This is the easiest type of paint to apply, and the most common type of paint for heavy transportation vehicles, construction equipment and aircraft. It is also widely used on cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Clear coat was not used on solid colors until the early 1990's.\n\n  * **Metallic paints** contain aluminium flakes to create a sparkling and grainy effect, generally referred to as a metallic look. This paint is harder to manage than solid paints because of the extra dimensions to consider. Metallic and pearlescent paints must be applied evenly to ensure a consistent looking finish without light and dark spots which are often called \"mottling\". Metallic basecoats are formulated so that the aluminium flake is parallel to the substrate. This maximises the \"flop\". This is the difference in the brightness between looking perpendicularly at the paint and that at an acute angle. The \"flop\" is maximised if the basecoat increases in viscosity shortly after application so that the aluminium flake which is in a random orientation after spraying is locked into this position while there is still much solvent (or water) in the coating. Subsequent evaporation of the solvent (or water), leads to a reduction in the film thickness of the drying coating, causing the aluminium flake to be dragged into an orientation parallel to the substrate. This orientation then needs to be unaffected by the application of the clear coat solvents. The formulation of the clear coat needs to be carefully chosen so that it will not \"re-dissolve\" the basecoat and thus affect the orientation of the metallic flake but will still exhibit enough adhesion between the coatings so as to avoid delamination of the clear coat. A similar mode of action occurs with pearlescent pigmented basecoats.\n  * **[Pearlescent Paints](/wiki/Pearlescent_coating \"Pearlescent coating\")** contain special iridescent pigments commonly referred to as \"pearls\". Pearl pigments impart a colored sparkle to the finish which works to create depth of color. Pearlescent paints can be two stage in nature (pearl base color + clear) or 3 stage in nature (basecoat + pearl mid-coat + clear-coat).[4]\n\n### Clearcoat[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_paint&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Clearcoat\")]\n\nUsually sprayed on top of a colored basecoat, clearcoat is a glossy and\ntransparent coating that forms the final interface with the environment. For\nthis reason, clearcoat must be durable enough to resist abrasion and\nchemically stable enough to withstand UV light. Clearcoat can be either\nsolvent or water-borne.[5]\n\nOne part and two part formulations are often referred to as 1k and 2k\nrespectively.[6] OEM (original equipment manufacture) clear coats applied to\nthe metal bodies of cars are normally 1K systems since they can be heated to\naround 140 deg C to effect cure. The clear coats applied to the plastic\ncomponents like the bumpers and wing mirrors however are 2K systems since they\ncan normally only accept temperatures up to about 90 deg C. These 2 K systems\nare normally applied \"off line\" with the coated plastic parts fixed to the\npainted metallic body. Owing to the difference in formulation of the 1K and 2K\nsystems and the fact they are coated in different locations they have a\ndifferent effect on the \"redissolving\" of the metallic base coat. This is most\neasily seen in the light metallic paints like the silver and light blue or\ngreen shades where the \"flop\" difference is most marked.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Automotive_paint&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ John Pfanstiehl (1998).
