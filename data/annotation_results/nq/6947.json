The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first\nappeared in the 1920s, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates\nentitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930s, when Rowntree's shifted focus\nand production onto its [Black Magic](/wiki/Black_Magic_\\(chocolates\\) \"Black\nMagic \\(chocolates\\)\") and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative\nproducts the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued.[4] The\noriginal four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York\nFactory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that \"a man could\ntake to work in his pack\".[5] The bar launched on 29 August 1935, under the\ntitle of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at [2d](/wiki/Old_penny_sterling\n\"Old penny sterling\")), and was sold in London and throughout Southern\nEngland.[6]\n\nThe product's official title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat\nChocolate Crisp in 1937, the same year that Kit Kat began to incorporate\n\"Break\" into its recognisable advertising strategy.[4] The colour scheme and\nfirst flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), when food shortages prompted an\nalteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to dark\nchocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was adorned\nin blue.[7] After the war the title was altered to Kit Kat and resumed its\noriginal milk recipe and red packaging.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/KitKat.jpg/220px-\nKitKat.jpg)](/wiki/File:KitKat.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:KitKat.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n4-finger US Kit Kat\n\nFollowing on from its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940s Kit Kat was\nexported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In\n1958, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT Orland, created the iconic\nadvertising line \"Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat\". The brand further expanded in\nthe 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet\nEuropean demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the USA\nand Japan through the Hershey and [Fujiya](/wiki/Fujiya_Co. \"Fujiya Co.\")\ncompanies, respectively.[4]\n\nIn June 1988, Swiss company Nestlé acquired Kit Kat through the purchase of\nRowntree's. This gave Nestlé global control over the brand, except in the\nUS,[8] and production and distribution increased with new facilities in Japan\nand additional manufacturing operations set up in Malaysia, India and\nChina.[4]\n\nThe Hershey Company has a licence to produce Kit Kat bars in the United States\nwhich dates from 1970, when Hershey executed a licensing agreement with\nRowntree. Nestlé, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honour\nthe licensing agreement when it bought Rowntree in 1988 which allowed Hershey\nto retain the Kit Kat licence so long as Hershey was not sold. As Kit Kat is\none of Hershey's top five brands in the US market, the Kit Kat licence was a\nkey factor in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in\n2002.[9][10]\n\nVariants in the traditional chocolate bar first appeared in 1996 when Kit Kat\nOrange, the first flavour variant, was introduced in the United Kingdom. Its\nsuccess was followed by several varieties including mint and caramel, and in\n1999 Kit Kat Chunky was launched and received favourably by international\nconsumers. Variations on the traditional Kit Kat have continued to develop\nthroughout the 2000s. In 2000, Nestlé acquired Fujiya's share of the brand in\nJapan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and\nVenezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe.[4] Throughout\nthe decade Kit Kat has introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions\nwithin specific consumer markets, and celebrated its 75th anniversary on 10\nOctober 2009.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately 1\ncentimetre (0.4 in) by 9 centimetres (3.5 in). A two-finger bar was launched\nin the 1930s, and has remained the company's best-selling biscuit brand ever\nsince.[6] The 1999 Kit Kat Chunky (known as Big Kat and Kit Kat Extra Crispy\nin the US) has one large finger approximately 2.5 centimetres (1 in) wide. Kit\nKat bars contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging\nfrom the half-finger sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan, to the three-fingered\nvariants in Arabia, to the twelve-finger family-size bars in Australia and\nFrance. Kit Kat bars are sold individually and in bags, boxes and multi-packs.\nIn Ireland, France, the UK and America Nestlé also produces a Kit Kat [ice\ncream](/wiki/Ice_cream \"Ice cream\"), and in Australia and Malaysia, Kit Kat\n[Drumsticks](/wiki/Drumstick_\\(ice_cream\\) \"Drumstick \\(ice\ncream\\)\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn 2010, a new £5 million manufacturing line was opened by Nestlé in York.\nThis will produce more than a billion Kit Kat bars each year.[11]\n\n## Global confection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kit_Kat&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Global confection\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/KitKat_World_Map.png/220px-\nKitKat_World_Map.png)](/wiki/File:KitKat_World_Map.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:KitKat_World_Map.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nCountries where Kit Kat is marketed.\n\nKit Kat bars are produced in 16 countries by Nestlé: [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil\n\"Brazil\"), [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\"), UK, [Canada](/wiki/Canada\n\"Canada\"), [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"), [New\nZealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\"), [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa\n\"South Africa\"), [Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\"), [Russia](/wiki/Russia\n\"Russia\"), [Japan](/wiki/Kit_Kats_in_Japan \"Kit Kats in Japan\"),\n[China](/wiki/China \"China\"), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia \"Malaysia\"),\n[Thailand](/wiki/Thailand \"Thailand\"), [India](/wiki/India \"India\"),\n[Turkey](/wiki/Turkey \"Turkey\"), [United Arab\nEmirates](/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates \"United Arab Emirates\"),\n[Bulgaria](/wiki/Bulgaria \"Bulgaria\") and [Algeria](/wiki/Algeria \"Algeria\").\nKit Kat bars in the United States are produced under licence by The Hershey\nCompany, a Nestlé competitor, due to a prior licensing agreement with\nRowntree. The year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the\nconfectionery industry in general. The popularity of [low carb](/wiki/Low_carb\n\"Low carb\") diets and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in\nmany parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from\n[Cadbury](/wiki/Cadbury \"Cadbury\")'s newly formed [Dairy\nMilk](/wiki/Cadbury_Dairy_Milk \"Cadbury Dairy Milk\") superbrand also\ncontributed to sales of the Kit Kat decreasing considerably in its home market\nof the UK, and threatened to depose it from its No.1 position.[12][13] The\nsolution adopted by Nestlé and others was to increase dramatically the number\nof new and unique variations of their confections and market them as [limited\nor special editions](/wiki/Special_edition \"Special edition\"), whereby they\nwould usually only be available for a few months at a time so as not to impact\nthe sales of their permanent edition counterparts.[14] The strategy initially\nreversed the decline of the Kit Kat[15] and has been adopted worldwide by\nNestlé, Hershey, [Mars](/wiki/Mars_Incorporated \"Mars Incorporated\") and\nothers with similar success.[16][17]\n\nThis has resulted in many new flavours and varieties of the Kit Kat and other\nconfections appearing globally since then. While some flavours have been hits,\nmany have flopped, alienating some consumers in the process, causing Nestlé to\nscale back on new releases.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn September 2006, Nestlé announced that they would be cutting 645 jobs in\ntheir York factory and moving [Smarties](/wiki/Smarties \"Smarties\") production\nto their [Hamburg](/wiki/Hamburg \"Hamburg\") factory in which two thirds of\nproduction was already taking place. They stated that this move would allow\nfor a £20 million investment to modernise the antiquated York factory and\nimprove Kit Kat production.[18]\n\nAs [dark chocolate](/wiki/Chocolate#Classification \"Chocolate\") has seen\nincreased demand and favour worldwide because of its purported health\nbenefits, September 2006 saw the launch of the four-finger Kit Kat Fine Dark\nin the UK as a permanent edition, as well as new packaging for the entire\nbrand.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] Hershey had sold the four-finger Kit Kat Dark in the US several\nyears previously as a limited edition, and has begun doing so again.[19]\n\nNestlé now manufactures two finger Kit Kats with natural flavourings, and for\nthe first time, Kit Kats in this format are suitable for vegans.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] It is\nnot known at this date whether or not other varieties will follow suit. In\n2014, Kit Kat was ranked the third best selling chocolate bar in the UK, after\n[Dairy Milk](/wiki/Cadbury_Dairy_Milk \"Cadbury Dairy Milk\") and\n[Galaxy](/wiki/Galaxy_\\(chocolate\\) \"Galaxy \\(chocolate\\)\").[20]\n\n## Design[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kit_Kat&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Design\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/Kit-Kat-Wrapper-\nSmall.jpg/220px-Kit-Kat-Wrapper-Small.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kit-Kat-Wrapper-\nSmall.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kit-Kat-Wrapper-Small.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe US packaging\n\nWhen first introduced, the original Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp bar had a red\nwrapper, which briefly became blue between 1945–1947. As a result of milk\nshortages after the end of World War II, the milk chocolate coating was\nsuspended and a dark chocolate was used instead during that period.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nSince its introduction in the 1970s, the Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and\nadvertising in the United States differed from the branding used in every\nother country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted\n[ellipse](/wiki/Ellipse \"Ellipse\") logo used worldwide by Nestlé, though the\nellipse was red and the text white. The US version of \"Kit Kat Chunky\" is\nknown as \"Big Kat\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the product has traditionally been wrapped in silver\nfoil and an outer paper band. In 2001, [flow\nwrap](/w/index.php?title=Flow_wrap&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Flow wrap \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") plastic was substituted as the confectionery's\npackaging.[21]\n\nIn Norway, a similar product is manufactured by [Mondelēz\nInternational](/wiki/Mondel%C4%93z_International \"Mondelēz International\") and\nsold as [Kvikk Lunsj](/wiki/Kvikk_Lunsj \"Kvikk Lunsj\"); Kvikk Lunsj XXL is\nsimilar to a Kit Kat Chunky.\n\n## Marketing and\npromotion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kit_Kat&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Marketing and promotion\")]\n\nAfter launching in the 1930s, Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was originally\nadvertised as \"the biggest little meal\" and \"the best companion to a cup of\ntea\". During World War II, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime\nfoodstuff, with the slogan \"what active people need\". 'Kitty the Kat' arrived\nin the late 1940s to emphasise the \"rich full cream milk\" qualities of the bar\nand, thanks to contemporary improvements in production methods, also\nhighlighted the new and improved 'snap' by responding to a biscuit being\nbroken off screen. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the first\ncolour TV advertisement appeared in 1969.\n\nSince 1958, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been \"Have\na break... have a Kit Kat\". However, in 1995, Nestlé sought to trademark the\n\"Have a break\" portion. After a ten-year legal battle, which was contested by\nrival Mars, the [European Court of Justice](/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice\n\"European Court of Justice\") ruled on 7 July 2005 to send the case back to the\n[British courts](/wiki/Courts_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Courts of the United\nKingdom\").[22] In 2004, Nestlé UK used the slogan \"Make the most of your\nbreak\",[23] but later returned to the original slogan.\n\nThe United States also used the short-lived slogan, \"Tastes So Good, You'll\nRoar\", in the early 1980s. The TV commercial most known from this slogan\ninvolves a young man biting into one of the Kit Kat bars in a grocery store,\nand roaring like a lion so loudly the whole store shakes violently, knocking\nitems from the shelves. Another short-lived US slogan was \"That's What You\nWant\", whose television adverts showed people pulling unlikely foodstuffs from\ntheir pockets or purses, before rejecting them in favour of a Kit Kat.\n\nThe \"classic\" American version of the \"Gimme a Break\" Kit Kat jingle (in use\nin the US since 1986) was written by Ken Shuldman (copy) and Michael A. Levine\n(music) for the [DDB Advertising Agency](/wiki/DDB_Worldwide \"DDB Worldwide\").\nVersions of the original have been covered by [Carrie\nUnderwood](/wiki/Carrie_Underwood \"Carrie Underwood\"), [Shawn\nColvin](/wiki/Shawn_Colvin \"Shawn Colvin\"), and many studio singers, as well\nas people who have appeared on-camera in the commercials. The jingle was cited\nin a study by [University of Cincinnati](/wiki/University_of_Cincinnati\n\"University of Cincinnati\") researcher James J. Kellaris as one of the top ten\n\"[earworms](/wiki/Earworm \"Earworm\")\" – bits of melody that become stuck in\nyour head. Another version of the advertising jingle 'Gimme a break' created\nfor Kit Kat \"Factory\" commercial in the US was an original recording by\n[Andrew W.K.](/wiki/Andrew_W.K. \"Andrew W.K.\") W.K. was hired to write a new\nmusical version for their \"Gimme a break\" slogan. Variations on the Andrew\nW.K. advertisement included executive dance routines in corporate offices and\na network newsroom. However, the \"classic\" song has also been used again since\nthe newer version first aired in 2004.\n\nA 1989 United Kingdom advertisement for Kit Kat, in which a zoo photographer\n\"takes a break\" from waiting for pandas to appear in an enclosure and misses\nthem performing a dance routine, came in 30th in [Channel 4](/wiki/Channel_4\n\"Channel 4\")'s \"100 Greatest Adverts\" poll in 2000.\n\nThe Maltese tour boat [MV _Lady Davinia_](/wiki/HMS_Greetham_\\(M2632\\) \"HMS\nGreetham \\(M2632\\)\") had a distinctive red and white Kit Kat paint scheme\nbefore she sank in 2008.\n\nIn late 2004 through to the end of 2006, Nestlé Rowntree sponsored the English\nfootball club [York City F.C.](/wiki/York_City_F.C. \"York City F.C.\"). As a\nresult, the club's home-ground, [Bootham Crescent](/wiki/Bootham_Crescent\n\"Bootham Crescent\"), was renamed to KitKat Crescent.[24]\n\nIn an 2012 advertising campaign in the UK and Ireland, several new flavours of\nChunky Kit Kat were marketed, with consumers being asked to vote for their\nfavourite. Selecting from white chocolate, double chocolate, peanut butter,\nand orange, Peanut butter was the winner by having 47% of votes. A similar\ncampaign occurred in 2013 with mint, coconut, hazelnut and chocolate fudge.\n\n### Association with\nAndroid[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kit_Kat&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section:\nAssociation with Android\")]\n\nIn September 2013, it was announced that [version 4.4](/wiki/Android_KitKat\n\"Android KitKat\") of [Google](/wiki/Google \"Google\")'s\n[Android](/wiki/Android_\\(operating_system\\) \"Android \\(operating system\\)\")\nmobile operating system would be named \"KitKat\".[25] Google\n[licensed](/wiki/Brand_licensing \"Brand licensing\") the name from Nestlé, with\nno money changing hands.[26] A promotion ran in numerous countries with\nspecially branded Android Kit Kat bars to win [Nexus\n7](/wiki/Nexus_7_\\(2013_version\\) \"Nexus 7 \\(2013 version\\)\") devices and\n[Google Play Store](/wiki/Google_Play_Store \"Google Play Store\") credit.[27]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/A_Kitkat_bar_statue_in_Googleplex_Headquarters.jpg/220px-\nA_Kitkat_bar_statue_in_Googleplex_Headquarters.jpg)](/wiki/File:A_Kitkat_bar_statue_in_Googleplex_Headquarters.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:A_Kitkat_bar_statue_in_Googleplex_Headquarters.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA Kitkat bar statue in Googleplex Headquarters\n\n### Fairtrade[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kit_Kat&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Fairtrade\")]\n\nIn December 2009, it was announced that the four finger variety of Kit Kat\nwould use [Fairtrade](/wiki/Fairtrade_certification \"Fairtrade certification\")\nchocolate (at least in Britain and Ireland) from January 2010.[28] It has also\nbeen announced that the Fairtrade Kit Kat promotion will be extended to the\nfinger edition as of January 2010.[29]\n\n### Golden ticket draw[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kit_Kat&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Golden ticket draw\")]\n\nDuring the first three weeks of _[Big Brother Series\n7](/wiki/Big_Brother_2006_\\(UK\\) \"Big Brother 2006 \\(UK\\)\")_ , Channel 4\nconducted a promotion in conjunction with Nestlé to distribute 100 \"golden\ntickets\" randomly throughout Kit Kats, in a style reminiscent of the story\n_[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory](/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory\n\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\")_. Members of the public finding these\ntickets were permitted to use them to give themselves a chance to become a\n_Big Brother_ housemate and bypass the standard auditions process.\n\nGolden ticket holders were invited to a television show where one of them,\n[Susie Verrico](/wiki/Susie_Verrico \"Susie Verrico\"), was chosen to enter the\nHouse by [Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace](/wiki/Aisleyne_Horgan-Wallace \"Aisleyne\nHorgan-Wallace\"), picking a ball out of a machine at random.\n\nThis contest caused some controversy, with the [Advertising Standards\nAuthority](/wiki/Advertising_Standards_Authority_\\(United_Kingdom\\)\n\"Advertising Standards Authority \\(United Kingdom\\)\") saying that the terms\nand conditions of the draw should have been made clearer in related\nadvertisements, and that an independent adjudicator should have been present\nbefore and during the draw.[30]\n\n## Varieties[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kit_Kat&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Varieties\")]\n\n### Flavours[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Kit_Kat&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Flavours\")]\n\nMany varieties of Kit Kat have existed, either permanently or as limited\neditions, such as those sold to commemorate festivals such as [St. Valentine's\nDay](/wiki/St._Valentine%27s_Day \"St. Valentine's Day\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\nJapan, Nestlé has introduced over 200 different flavours since 2000,[31]\nincluding [ginger ale](/wiki/Ginger_ale \"Ginger ale\"), [soy\nsauce](/wiki/Soy_sauce \"Soy sauce\"), [creme brulee](/wiki/Creme_brulee \"Creme\nbrulee\"), [green tea](/wiki/Green_tea \"Green tea\"), [sake](/wiki/Sake \"Sake\"),\nand banana.[32] The flavours are designed to appeal to younger buyers,[33] and\nare often bought as good-luck gifts as the brand name echoes the Japanese\nphrase \"Kitto Katsu\", roughly translating as \"surely win.\"[31]\n\nThe Kit Kat Orange was the first flavour variant to be introduced in the\nUnited Kingdom, in 1996 and 1998 in Ireland.
