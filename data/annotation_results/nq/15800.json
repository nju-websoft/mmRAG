The Green Ranger, [Rita\nRepulsa](/wiki/Rita_Repulsa \"Rita Repulsa\"), betrays them and plans to\ndominate the universe. The Red Ranger, [Zordon](/wiki/Zordon \"Zordon\"),\nsurvives Rita's attack and hides five of the Rangers' power source, the Power\nCoins. He orders [Alpha 5](/wiki/Alpha_5_\\(Power_Rangers\\) \"Alpha 5 \\(Power\nRangers\\)\") to perform [a meteor strike](/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor \"Chicxulub\nimpactor\") that kills him, the dinosaurs, and sends Rita to the bottom of the\nsea, foiling her scheme.\n\nIn 21st-century [Angel Grove](/wiki/Angel_Grove \"Angel Grove\"), high school\nfootball star [Jason Scott](/wiki/Jason_Lee_Scott \"Jason Lee Scott\") is\ndismissed from the team and placed under house arrest after a failed prank. In\ndetention, he encounters [Billy Cranston](/wiki/Billy_Cranston \"Billy\nCranston\") and [Kimberly Hart](/wiki/Kimberly_Hart \"Kimberly Hart\"). After\ndefending Billy from a bully, Billy offers to deactivate Jason's ankle monitor\nfor help at an old gold mine that evening. Once there, Jason leaves to explore\nand runs into Kimberly. Billy detonates explosives to break some rock,\nattracting the attention of Jason, Kimberly and nearby students\n[Trini](/wiki/Trini_Kwan \"Trini Kwan\") and [Zack](/wiki/Zack_Taylor \"Zack\nTaylor\"). The five discover the Power Coins and each take one. While escaping\nmine security, their car is hit by a train. The five find themselves at home\nthe next morning and discover that the coins have granted them superhuman\nabilities. Elsewhere, Rita's body is found. Waking, she goes on a rampage,\nhunting pieces of gold to raise her minion [Goldar](/wiki/Goldar \"Goldar\") to\nfind the Zeo Crystal.\n\nThe five teenagers return to the mine and discover an ancient spaceship where\nthey meet Alpha 5 and Zordon's consciousness. They inform the teenagers about\nthe Rangers history and Rita, warning that they have eleven days until Rita\nhas her full power, finds the Zeo Crystal, and uses it to destroy life on\nEarth. The five leave the ship with no intention of returning until Zordon\npleads with Jason to convince the team.\n\nThe five return to train the next day, but they cannot morph. They spend the\nnext week training against simulated Putties and trying unsuccessfully to\nmorph. To inspire the Rangers, Alpha reveals the [Zords](/wiki/Zord \"Zord\").\nZack takes his Zord out for a joyride and almost kills the other Rangers when\nhe crashes it. This angers Jason, and they fight. While trying to separate the\ntwo, Billy spontaneously morphs. However, when he becomes conscious of it, the\narmor disappears. Angered at their lack of progress, Zordon dismisses the\ngroup. Jason returns to the ship to confront Zordon and discovers that once\nthe Rangers morph, it will open the Morphing Grid and allow Zordon to restore\nhimself in a physical body. Feeling betrayed, Jason accuses Zordon of using\nthe team for his own benefit. That night, the team camp at the mine and bond\nwith each other.\n\nLater that night, Rita attacks Trini and orders her to bring the Rangers to\nthe docks. Trini informs them about Rita and they arrive to fight, but are\nquickly defeated. Rita forces Billy to reveal the location of the Zeo Crystal,\nwhich he'd figured out, kills him, and releases the others. The Rangers take\nBilly's body to the ship and ask Zordon to resurrect him. The Rangers agree\nthey would give their lives for each other and resolve to defeat Rita. In\ndoing so, they unlock the Morphing Grid. Zordon revives Billy, sacrificing\nbeing able to restore his physical self. With the team restored and confident,\nthe Rangers morph into their armor.\n\nRita creates Goldar, raises an army of Putties, and attacks Angel Grove to\nfind the Zeo Crystal. The Rangers battle the Putties and head to Angel Grove\nin their Zords. After the Rangers destroy the Putties, Goldar pushes the\nRangers and their Zords into a fiery pit. In the pit, the Zords combine and\nform the Megazord. Rita merges with Goldar. The Rangers battle and destroy\nGoldar. After refusing Jason's offer to surrender, a defiant Rita tells the\nRangers that more will come for the crystal and leaps at the Megazord only to\nbe slapped into space. The Rangers are praised as local heroes, and with\nRita's threats foiled, they return to their normal lives but keeping their\npowers.\n\nIn a [mid-credits scene](/wiki/Post-credits_scene \"Post-credits scene\"), in\ndetention, the teacher announces that [Tommy Oliver](/wiki/Tommy_Oliver \"Tommy\nOliver\") will be joining them, but the desk is empty save for a green\njacket.[note 1]\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Power_Rangers_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Dacre Montgomery](/wiki/Dacre_Montgomery \"Dacre Montgomery\") as [Jason Scott / Red Ranger](/wiki/Jason_Lee_Scott \"Jason Lee Scott\"), the leader of the Power Rangers.
