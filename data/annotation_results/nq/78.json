It's now\nproduced by [Telepictures Productions](/wiki/Telepictures_Productions\n\"Telepictures Productions\") and Syndicated Productions, while distributed by\n[Warner Bros. Television](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television \"Warner Bros.\nTelevision\").[2] It is taped at the [NBC Tower](/wiki/NBC_Tower \"NBC Tower\")\nin [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\"), but includes cases and\n[litigants](/wiki/Litigants \"Litigants\") from other U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nGreg Mathis's \"inspirational and positive messages to young people\" won the\ncourt show a PRISM Commendation in May 2002. The court show also won an\n_[NAACP Image Award](/wiki/NAACP_Image_Award \"NAACP Image Award\")_ in 2004 and\na Daytime Emmy Award in 2018.[1]\n\nEach _Judge Mathis_ episode runs for one hour and typically consists of 4\ncases.[1] The show is broadcast weekdays nationwide in the United States. It\nis also broadcast in Canada through [Omni Television](/wiki/Omni_Television\n\"Omni Television\").[3][4] The show has aired since 1999 and has aired over\n2000 episodes.\n\nIn the 2014-15 television season, _Judge Mathis_ began its 16th season, making\nMathis the longest serving [African American](/wiki/African_American \"African\nAmerican\") court show arbitrator, after [Judge Joe\nBrown](/wiki/Joe_Brown_\\(judge\\) \"Joe Brown \\(judge\\)\") whose\n[program](/wiki/Judge_Joe_Brown \"Judge Joe Brown\") lasted 15 seasons.\n\n_Judge Mathis_ is the fourth longest running courtroom series behind _[Divorce\nCourt](/wiki/Divorce_Court \"Divorce Court\")_ , _[The People's\nCourt](/wiki/The_People%27s_Court \"The People's Court\")_, and _Judge Judy_. It\nbegan its 19th season on Monday, September 4, 2017.[5]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Show format\n  * 2 Incorporation of life story into court show\n  * 3 Judge Gregory Mathis's adjudicating approach\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Show format[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Judge_Mathis&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Show format\")]\n\nThe cases on _Judge Mathis_ are classified as [tort law](/wiki/Tort_law \"Tort\nlaw\"), civil disputes with a maximum $5,000 claim, a typical amount for [small\nclaims court](/wiki/Small_claims_court \"Small claims court\"). The producers of\nthe show select the cases. To acquire cases, the show solicits real-life\n[litigants](/wiki/Litigant \"Litigant\") with pending disputes or individuals\nwith potential disputes. If litigants agree to be on the show, they are paid a\ntalent fee ranging from $150 to $300, and they receive travel accommodations.\nMathis does have prior knowledge of the cases. In all cases, litigants give\ntheir prospective case managers all evidence in advance. Any real legal case\npending must be dismissed by both parties. Typically, Mathis's producers only\nseek cases that they deem \"juicy\" enough for TV. Occasionally, Mathis leaves\nthe courtroom to deliberate and then returns with his verdict.[6] Upon final\njudgment, he may briefly explain the legal principle guiding his verdict,\nespecially if his ruling is based on a particular state's law. Reportedly,\nMathis' rulings conform to the laws of the state where the case was originally\nfiled.[7]\n\n## Incorporation of life story into court\nshow[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Judge_Mathis&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Incorporation of life story into court show\")]\n\nAs a child and a teenager, Mathis was frequently in legal trouble. He was a\nmember of a street gang in Detroit, and he was arrested and sentenced to jail\nfor illegally carrying a firearm when he was 17 years old.[8]\n\nMathis has frequently used his courtroom series to highlight his troubled-\nyouth-turned-success-story as a way of motivating and inspiring his audience\n(especially youth audience) that there's no adversity that they can't pick\nthemselves up from. It is from his background where Mathis derives much of his\ncourtroom formula. For example, his show's opening theme was formerly a brief\ndocumentary of his powerful life story. As another example, he takes a liking\nto litigants who've seen the error of their ways and have made efforts to\nimprove and better their lives.[9]\n\n## Judge Gregory Mathis's adjudicating\napproach[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Judge_Mathis&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Judge Gregory Mathis's adjudicating approach\")]\n\nMain article: [Greg Mathis](/wiki/Greg_Mathis \"Greg Mathis\")\n\nMathis typically begins proceedings by having [litigants](/wiki/Litigant\n\"Litigant\") expound on their side of the dispute, so as to gain insight into\nthe matter. Cases on _Judge Mathis_ tend to go deeper and to more revealing\nplaces than those of most other court shows. He also calls attention to\npeculiarities or juicy details exposed throughout the course of the\nproceedings as a means of making the cases more interesting to viewers.\nFurthermore, Mathis doesn't hesitate to tackle any social issues that emerge\nduring the proceedings, tying his [social justice](/wiki/Social_justice\n\"Social justice\") perspectives to the cases.[9]\n\nWhile hearing the testimonies, Mathis takes on a relaxed, attentive,\nunderstanding and open-minded nature. Rarely missing an opportunity to jest or\npoke fun, Mathis is given to fun, humor, good-natured ridicule and gibes,\noften rousing his audience to uproarious amusement. He sometimes cuts the\ntension–even tension he himself has fostered–with wisecracks or taunting\nremarks. Mathis has bantered directly at audience members on occasion, also\nresulting in audience amusement.[10] He uses a rather high-pitched voice as\npart of stultifying litigants and suggesting that they've not recognized the\nobvious.[9][11]\n\nCombined with his teasing and comedic tendencies on the bench,[10] Mathis is\nknown for his [street smart](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/street-smart\n\"wikt:street-smart\"), urban expressions and stern side as well. In moments in\nwhich Mathis has found a litigant guilty of a particularly reprehensible act,\nhe takes on a very [resentful](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/resent\n\"wikt:resent\") nature along with lecturing and shaming behaviors. Sometimes in\nthese moments, Mathis makes a point of solemnizing his courtroom due to prior\nlaughs and lightheartedness, letting litigants and everyone on hand know that\nthings are no longer a laughing matter and that he's to be taken seriously.\n\nThe final portion of most of the cases generally see Mathis displaying a\nharshly corrective side, providing an explanation behind the direction of his\n[verdict](/wiki/Verdict \"Verdict\") in the form of a sharp tirade, unbroken in\ndelivery so as not to allow anyone a word in edgewise before his gavel pound\nand exit.\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Judge_Mathis&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ [\"Judge Mathis Bio\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20120227140532/http://judgemathistv.warnerbros.com/html/abouttheshow.html).
