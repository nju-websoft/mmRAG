Like\nits predecessor, its premise shares several similarities to the fifth film in\nthe original series, _[Battle for the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Battle_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Battle for the Planet of the\nApes\")_ , but it is not a direct remake.\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\nbegan on October 14, 2015, in [Vancouver, British\nColumbia](/wiki/Vancouver,_British_Columbia \"Vancouver, British Columbia\"),\nCanada. _War for the Planet of the Apes_ premiered in [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") on July 10, 2017, and was\ntheatrically released in the United States on July 14, 2017, by [20th Century\nFox](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox \"20th Century Fox\").[5] The film has grossed over\n$490 million and received critical praise, with many reviewers highlighting\nthe performances (particularly Serkis), visual effects, story, direction, and\nmusical score.

Forcing Caesar and his tribe of intelligent apes against a rogue U.S.\nmilitary faction known as Alpha-Omega. Led by a ruthless Colonel, Alpha-Omega\nemploys many apes formerly loyal to Koba. These apes are derogatorily called\n\"donkeys\".\n\nAn attack by an Alpha-Omega platoon on an ape colony is rebuffed when Caesar\nrallies his apes in defense. Capturing alive a soldier named Preacher, three\nother soldiers and \"donkey\" [gorilla](/wiki/Gorilla \"Gorilla\") named Red,\nCaesar explains that he executed Koba for causing the war and only desires\npeace. Caesar then releases the soldiers, hoping the display of mercy will\nshow the Colonel that the apes are not savages. Meanwhile, Red escapes by\ninjuring the albino gorilla Winter.\n\nWhile ceremonially disposing of the dead apes, Caesar welcomes back his eldest\nson Blue Eyes and his lieutenant Rocket from a long journey. Blue Eyes reports\nthat they have found a place across the [desert](/wiki/Desert \"Desert\") that\nis ideal for them. An uneasy Winter beseeches that the tribe leave\nimmediately. Though agreeing to leave, Caesar feels they need to prepare\nfirst. That night, the Colonel leads a team of soldiers in infiltrating the\nape’s home. Believing he had succeeded, the Colonel begins to leave only to be\ndiscovered by Caesar. Enraged upon seeing that the human killed his wife\nCornelia and son, he attempts to prevent the Colonel's escape but fails. After\nthe attack the apes cannot find Winter.\n\nIn the morning, the tribe gathers to journey to safety. Leaving his youngest\nson, Cornelius, in the care of Blue Eyes' wife Lake, Caesar departs to exact\nrevenge while serving as the decoy for the other apes. Accompanied by his\n[orangutan](/wiki/Orangutan \"Orangutan\") adviser Maurice, gorilla lieutenant\nLuca, and Rocket, the apes enter an abandoned village where they kill a\ndeserted soldier in self-defense. Searching the village the apes discover a\nmute girl. Maurice befriends and adopts the girl, giving her a small [rag\ndoll](/wiki/Rag_doll \"Rag doll\").\n\nAt a beach side military camp, the apes spot Winter inside and the group sneak\nin. Winter, who became a \"donkey\", tells Caesar that the Colonel has departed\nfor the border, to meet soldiers from the north. Winter attempts to call out\nfor help but the apes restrain him and in the struggle Caesar accidentally\nkills him. In the morning the military breaks camp and the apes follow. Along\nthe way, the apes discover some soldiers who have been shot and left for dead.\nTheir examination of a surviving soldier reveals that he is mute like the\ngirl. Dying from his wounds, Caesar [kills](/wiki/Euthanasia \"Euthanasia\") him\nin an act of mercy.\n\nClimbing atop a radio tower, the apes search for direction the soldier’s\ntraveled. During this, a hooded figure steals one of their horses and the apes\ngive chase. Ending at a lodge, the apes corner the figure who is revealed to\nbe a chimpanzee named Bad Ape. The group is surprised to discover he is an\nintelligent ape but from another zoo. While camping with Bad Ape they discover\nhe knows where the border is and he hesitantly agrees to lead them there. The\ngroup reach the border where they see a quarantine facility. When attempting\nto get a closer look, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from some soldiers. An\nangered Caesar decides to proceed alone rather than endanger his allies\nfurther.\n\nAt the facility, Caesar learns that Alpha-Omega captured his tribe and are\nforcing them to build a wall without food or water. Caesar is then captured by\nRed who brings him to the Colonel. The Colonel tells Caesar that he intended\nto kill him rather than his son and wife. With an act of defiance Caesar\ncauses the other apes to stop working but the Colonel threatens to kill Caesar\nto get the apes to continue working. Caesar deduces that the Colonel is\nbarricading the facility to fend off other military who are against him for\nkilling his own soldiers. The Colonel commends Caesar's intelligence and goes\non to tell Caesar that the Simian Flu virus had mutated and the human carriers\nbecame mute and [devolved](/wiki/Devolution_\\(biology\\) \"Devolution\n\\(biology\\)\") into a primitive state. The mutation infecting his only son, The\nColonel killed him and ordered his men to kill anyone that happens to be\ninfected or defies his instruction. A survivor of this purge told the military\nin the north who sent men to relieve the Colonel of his command. The Colonel\nsays he spared one person to give a message to the military to come after him\nat the facility. The Colonel knows that the facility used to be a weapons\ndepot and plans on using it’s resources to fight off the military. Finally the\nColonel declares that he is fighting a \"[holy war](/wiki/Religious_war\n\"Religious war\")\" for humanity's survival and redemption.\n\nCaesar is tortured with starvation to force his clan to work. The mute girl\nsneaks into the facility to give Caesar food, water, and her rag doll. To\nprevent her from being discovered, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a\ndiversion. The next day, the Colonel comes to see if Caesar is still alive,\nand confiscates the doll upon discovering it. Together, Caesar and Rocket are\nable to work out a means of escape via an underground tunnel leading out of\nthe facility. Here Maurice names the girl Nova, and along with Bad Ape use the\ntunnel to rescue the apes, but Caesar remains behind to settle his affair with\nthe Colonel as the facility comes under attack by the northern army. Caesar\nfinds the Colonel has been infected by the virus from contact with Nova's\ndoll. Caesar chooses not to kill the Colonel, instead watching him commit\n[suicide](/wiki/Suicide \"Suicide\") with his [pistol](/wiki/Pistol \"Pistol\").\n\nThe escaping apes are caught in the crossfire between the two armies. Red\nwatches the apes suffering and begins to doubt his allegiance to Alpha-Omega.\nCaesar attempts to blow up a large fuel tank to take out the Alpha-Omega\nforces from behind but he is shot with a [crossbow](/wiki/Crossbow \"Crossbow\")\nby Preacher. Red uses a [grenade launcher](/wiki/Grenade_launcher \"Grenade\nlauncher\") to kill Preacher and saves Caesar's life but is shot dead by a\nsoldier. Caesar succeeds in blowing up the fuel tank and escapes the facility\nas it is consumed in cascade of explosions. The victorious northern army\nnotices Caesar but before they can kill him, an [avalanche](/wiki/Avalanche\n\"Avalanche\") descends upon the base. The apes, carrying Nova, all survive by\nclimbing nearby trees. The apes then cross the desert to find an\n[oasis](/wiki/Oasis \"Oasis\"). While the other apes joyously celebrate their\nnew home, Maurice discovers Caesar's fatal arrow wound. Maurice promises to\ntell Cornelius who his father was and what he did for their tribe. Caesar then\nslowly and silently succumbs to his wounds, dying peacefully while Maurice and\nthe other apes look on.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n###\nApes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Apes\")]\n\n  * [Andy Serkis](/wiki/Andy_Serkis \"Andy Serkis\") as [Caesar](/wiki/List_of_Planet_of_the_Apes_characters#Caesar \"List of Planet of the Apes characters\"), an intelligent [common chimpanzee](/wiki/Common_chimpanzee \"Common chimpanzee\") who is leader to a tribe of genetically enhanced apes.[9]\n  * [Steve Zahn](/wiki/Steve_Zahn \"Steve Zahn\") as \"Bad Ape\", a common chimpanzee who lived in a zoo before the Simian Flu outbreak, and was a hermit before joining Caesar's group.[10][11]\n  * [Karin Konoval](/wiki/Karin_Konoval \"Karin Konoval\") as Maurice, a [Bornean orangutan](/wiki/Bornean_orangutan \"Bornean orangutan\") who is Caesar's adviser.[9]\n  * [Terry Notary](/wiki/Terry_Notary \"Terry Notary\") as Rocket, a common chimpanzee who is Caesar's brother-figure.[12]\n  * [Ty Olsson](/wiki/Ty_Olsson \"Ty Olsson\") as Red, a [Western lowland gorilla](/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla \"Western lowland gorilla\") who was once a follower of Koba, now serving the Colonel to defeat Caesar.

In January\n2014, the studio announced the third film, with Reeves returning to direct and\nco-write along with Bomback, and Peter Chernin, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver\nserving as producers.[23][24] During an interview in mid-November 2014 with\n[MTV](/wiki/MTV \"MTV\"), Andy Serkis said they did not know the next film's\nsetting. \"...It could be five years after the event. It could be the night\nafter the events of where we left '_Dawn_.'\"[25] In May 2015, the title was\nfirst given as _War of the Planet of the Apes_.[26] By October 2015, it had\nbeen retitled as _War for the Planet of the Apes_.[10]\n\nWhen director Reeves and screenwriter Bomback came on board to helm _Dawn_ ,\nthe film already had a release date, which led to an accelerated production\nschedule. However, with the third installment, Fox wanted to give the duo\nplenty of time to write and make the film. Taking advantage of this, the two\nbonded with each other more than before.[27]\n\nIn interviews for _Dawn_ , Reeves talked about the inevitable war Caesar would\nhave with the humans: \"As this story continues, we know that war is not\navoided by the end of _Dawn_. That is going to take us into the world of what\nhe is grappling with. Where he is going to be thrust into circumstances that\nhe never, ever wanted to deal with, and was hoping he could avoid. And now he\nis right in the middle of it. The things that happen in that story test him in\nhuge ways, in the ways in which his relationship with Koba haunts him deeply.\nIt’s going to be an epic story. I think you’ve probably read that I sort of\ndescribed it where in the first film was very much about his rise from humble\nbeginnings to being a revolutionary. The second movie was about having to rise\nto the challenge of being a great leader in the most difficult of times. This\nis going to be the story that is going to cement his status as a seminal\nfigure in ape history, and sort of leads to an almost biblical status. He is\ngoing to become like a mythic ape figure, like [Moses](/wiki/Moses\n\"Moses\").\"[28]\n\n[Toby Kebbell](/wiki/Toby_Kebbell \"Toby Kebbell\"), who portrayed Koba in\n_Dawn_ , had expressed interest in reprising his role or performing as other\ncharacters.[29] Plans to include Koba in a larger role in the film were\nabandoned early, with Bomback saying, \"If you stayed until the very end of\n_Dawn of the Planet of the Apes_ , you hear Koba’s breathing. We did that to\ngive us a tiny crack of a possibility that we could revive Koba if we wanted\nto. Very early on in spitballing, we realized there was nothing more to do\nwith Koba – certainly nothing that would exceed what he had done in the last\nstory. But we knew we wanted to keep him alive as an idea. In playing out the\nreality of what happened at the end of the last film, Caesar would be\ntraumatized by having to kill his brother. That would have resonance, and we\nwanted to make sure that did not get lost. So the answer was that we could go\ninside Caesar’s mind at this point and revisit Koba that way.\"[30]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\nIn August 2015, [Deadline](/wiki/Deadline.com \"Deadline.com\") reported that\n[Gabriel Chavarria](/wiki/Gabriel_Chavarria \"Gabriel Chavarria\") had been cast\nas one of the humans in the film.[31] In September 2015, _[The Hollywood\nReporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_ announced\nthat [Woody Harrelson](/wiki/Woody_Harrelson \"Woody Harrelson\") had been cast\nas the film's antagonist, and that Chavarria's role was supporting.[18] In\nOctober 2015, [TheWrap](/wiki/TheWrap \"TheWrap\") reported that [Steve\nZahn](/wiki/Steve_Zahn \"Steve Zahn\") was cast as a new ape in the film.[10] It\nwas also announced that actress Amiah Miller was cast as one of the film's\nhumans, with [Judy Greer](/wiki/Judy_Greer \"Judy Greer\") and [Karin\nKonoval](/wiki/Karin_Konoval \"Karin Konoval\") reprising their roles as\nCornelia and Maurice,[9][20] while [Aleks Paunovic](/wiki/Aleks_Paunovic\n\"Aleks Paunovic\") and [Sara Canning](/wiki/Sara_Canning \"Sara Canning\") were\ncast as new apes.[17][15]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\non the film began on October 14, 2015 in the [Lower\nMainland](/wiki/Lower_Mainland \"Lower Mainland\") in\n[Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver \"Vancouver\"), under the working title _Hidden\nFortress_.[32][33] Filming was expected to take place there until early March\n2016.[34] Parts of the film were expected to shoot for up to five days in the\n[Kananaskis](/wiki/Kananaskis_Range \"Kananaskis Range\") in late January and\nearly February.[35] In March, Serkis confirmed that he had finished shooting\nhis portions.[36]\n\n### Visual\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Visual effects\")]\n\nAs with _Rise_ and _Dawn_ , the visual effects for _War_ were created by [Weta\nDigital](/wiki/Weta_Digital \"Weta Digital\"); the apes were created with a\nmixture of motion-capture and CGI key-frame animation, as they were performed\nin motion-capture technology and animated in CGI.\n\n##\nInfluences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=War_for_the_Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Influences\")]\n\nAt [New York Comic-Con](/wiki/New_York_Comic-Con \"New York Comic-Con\") 2016,\nReeves explained that he and Bomback were influenced by many films before\nwriting. He said, \"One of the first things that Mark and I did because we had\njust finished _Dawn_ was that we decided to watch a million movies. We decided\nto do what people fantasize what Hollywood screenwriters get to do but no one\nactually does. We got Fox to give us a theater and we watched movie after\nmovie. We watched every _Planet of the Apes_ movie, war movies, westerns,\n_[Empire Strikes Back](/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back \"The Empire Strikes\nBack\")_... We just thought, 'We have to pretend we have all the time in the\nworld,' even though we had limited time. We got really inspired.\"[37]\n\nAdditionally, during production, Reeves and Bomback sought broader\ninspirations from films like _[The Bridge on the River\nKwai](/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\")_ and\n_[The Great Escape](/wiki/The_Great_Escape_\\(film\\) \"The Great Escape\n\\(film\\)\")_. Feeling that there was a need to imbue Biblical themes and\nelements, they also watched Biblical epics like _[Ben-Hur](/wiki/Ben-\nHur_\\(1959_film\\) \"Ben-Hur \\(1959 film\\)\")_ and _[The Ten\nCommandments](/wiki/The_Ten_Commandments_\\(1956_film\\) \"The Ten Commandments\n\\(1956 film\\)\")_. The influences and inspirations were made evident in the\nrelationship between Caesar and [Woody Harrelson](/wiki/Woody_Harrelson \"Woody\nHarrelson\")'s Colonel, a military leader with pretensions toward godhood. The\nparallels between Caesar as Moses and the Colonel as Pharaoh are quite\nevident. Caesar arranges for the escape of his oppressed and enslaved fellow\napes. The oppressor army is totally destroyed by an overwhelming \"sea\" as in\nthe Exodus story. Finally, when Caesar and his clan reach the mountain\noverlooking the \"promised land\" he dies--just as Moses did on Mt. Nebo. Reeves\nindebtedness to the Exodus story is substantial.
