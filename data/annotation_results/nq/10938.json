        "# How It Feels To Be Colored Me\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n**How It Feels To Be Colored Me** (1928) is an essay by [Zora Neale\nHurston](/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston \"Zora Neale Hurston\") published in _World\nTomorrow_ as a \"white journal sympathetic to Harlem Renaissance writers\"[1],\nillustrating her circumstance as an African American woman in the early 20th\ncentury in America. Most of Hurston's work involved her \"Negro\"\ncharacterization that were so true to reality, that she was known as an\nexcellent anthropologist, \"As an anthropologist and as an African- American\nwriter during the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston was uniquely situated to explore\nthe critical possibilities of marginality.\"[2][3]\n\nComing from an all- black community in Eatonville, Florida, she lived\ncomfortably due to her father holding high titles, John Hurston was a local\nBaptist preacher and the mayor of Eatonville. After the death of her mother in\n1904, at the age of nine years old, Hurston was forced to live with relatives\nin Jacksonville who worked as domestic servants. In her essay Hurston\nreferences Jacksonville where she describes that she felt \"thrown against a\nsharp white background\". Eatonville and Jacksonville became the main\ninfluential settings for her essay \"How it Feels To Be Colored Me\" and her\nnovel _Their Eyes Were Watching God._ In both writings Hurston begins to\ninvestigate the true meaning of individuality and personality, through the\nusage of anecdotes, imagery, tone, and figurative language. Hurston's writings\nallow the reader to understand \"personal expression to the arena of public\ndiscourse without losing the ties to their home cultures and languages\"[4]\n\n## Plot\nsummary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=How_It_Feels_To_Be_Colored_Me&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot summary\")]\n\nHurston begins the essay about her childhood in the town of Eatonville,\nFlorida, where Hurston is the main character. Hurston describes how she sits\non her front porch watching white people pass though her town. She greets her\nneighbors, dances and sings for the visiting white people. In return she\nreceives money. Hurston becomes comfortable with her surroundings in the small\ntown of Eatonville. At the age of thirteen her mother passes away and Hurston\nwas sent away to leave her home in Jacksonville to attend a boarding school.\nAt this point, Hurston is referred to as just another “colored girl.”[2] She\nthen elaborates how Eatonville was a safe zone for her since it was considered\na “colored town”[2](358). As time progressed, she realized the difference\nbetween herself and others surrounding her: her skin. She begins to feel a\nsense of isolation and loneliness. Although, Hurston claims that she does not\nconsider herself “tragically colored” but a regular human being, “At times I\nhave no race, I am me”[2](359). She mentions her experience at a jazz club\nwith a white friend, where through the music she expresses the racial\ndifference and distance between their lives. She concludes her essay\nacknowledging the difference but refuses the idea of separation. “I have no\nseparate feeling about being an American citizen and colored”[2] (360). She\nexplains that if the racial roles were reversed, and blacks discriminated\nagainst whites, the outcome is the same for a white person’s experience\namongst black people. In her final paragraph, she compares herself to a brown\npaper bag filled with random bits, just as everyone around her is a different\ncolored paper bag filled with small bits and pieces that make each unique.\nHurston concludes that every race is essential and special to the “Great\nStuffer of Bags.”[2] She encourages one not to focus on race, but one’s self-\nawareness and the similarities we all have in common.\n\n## Historical\nbackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=How_It_Feels_To_Be_Colored_Me&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Historical background\")]\n\nHurston has written plays, essays, poetry, short stories, and novels with an\nemphasis on folkloric foundation. She graduated from Columbia University as an\nanthropologist. Some scholars claim “Hurston belonged to the Depression- era\ngroup of black writers that also included Ralph Ellison and Richard Wright”\n([Encyclopedia of Women’s\nAutobiography](http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/abcwautob/hurston_zora_neale/0?searchId=6e2f68e4-1bc4-11e7-9cc9-0e58d2201a4d&result=4)).\nSimilarly, to other black writers in this era, Hurston used her writings to\nexpose the living conditions of black people, not only to black readers, but\nwhite readers. Although, Wright criticized Hurston for falsifying information\nand the perspective of black living even though Hurston presented social\nproblems in her writing. Hurston and Wright both wrote about the importance of\nself- identity. Hurston’s work writings emerge from “dislocation and\ndisorientation.” ([Encyclopedia of Women’s\nAutobiography](http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/abcwautob/hurston_zora_neale/0?searchId=6e2f68e4-1bc4-11e7-9cc9-0e58d2201a4d&result=4))\nHurston’s writing is known to have boldness with “heavy black english\ndialect.” ([Encyclopedia of Women’s\nAutobiography](http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/abcwautob/hurston_zora_neale/0?searchId=6e2f68e4-1bc4-11e7-9cc9-0e58d2201a4d&result=4))\nAlthough, some scholars debate whether Hurston’s work is true Harlem\nRenaissance writing. Margaret Perry’s survey of all literature in the Harlem\nRenaissance, suggests “Hurston should not be included in the literary canon of\nthe Harlem Renaissance because the bulk of her work appeared after the ‘true\ntime of the Harlem Renaissance’ a period in the years 1925 to 1928.”[5]\n(Musser 28) Alice Walker was one of many who rediscovered Zora Neale Hurston.\nWalker had become interested in Hurston’s works and wrote _I Love Myself When\nI Am Laughing… And Then Again When I Am Looking Mean and Impressive: A Zora\nNeale Hurston Reader_ in 1979. Similar to Hurston’s parallelism of life and\nher life in “How It Feels To Be Colored Me”, Walker’s writings were influenced\nby her own experiences. Walker not only rediscovered Hurston’s works, but\nrevisited the era of the Harlem Renaissance. She placed a huge emphasis\ntowards why the Harlem Renaissance writings were essential and lead the\ncontinuation of scholarship and publication of Hurston’s works after 1970.\n\n“How It Feels To Be Colored Me” is an essential essay which is linked to the\nstudies of African Literature, Feminist Literature, and African American\nStudies. Hurston’s essay also reveals her perspective of racial segregation\nthrough the usage of anecdotes, imagery, tone, and figurative speech. In the\nend she concludes we are all one race regardless of color.\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=How_It_Feels_To_Be_Colored_Me&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Johnson, Barbara (1985).
