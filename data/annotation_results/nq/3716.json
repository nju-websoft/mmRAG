century was a period of diplomatic competition between the British\nand Russian empires for spheres of influence in Asia known as the \"Great Game\"\nto the British and the \"Tournament of Shadows\" to the Russians.[6] With the\nexception of the insane [Emperor Paul](/wiki/Paul_I_of_Russia \"Paul I of\nRussia\") who ordered an invasion of India in 1800 (which was cancelled after\nhis assassination in 1801), no Russian tsar ever seriously considered invading\nIndia, but for most of the 19th century, Russia was viewed as \"the enemy\" in\nBritain, and any Russian advance into Central Asia was always assumed in\nLondon to be directed towards the conquest of India as the American historian\n[David Fromkin](/wiki/David_Fromkin \"David Fromkin\") observed \"no matter how\nfar-fetched\" such an interpretation might be.[7] In 1832, the First Reform\nBill lowering the franchise requirements to vote and hold office in the United\nKingdom was passed, which the ultra-conservative Emperor [Nicholas I of\nRussia](/wiki/Nicholas_I_of_Russia \"Nicholas I of Russia\") openly disapproved\nof, settling the stage for an Anglo-Russian \"cold war\", with many believing\nthat Russian autocracy and British democracy were bound to clash.[8] In 1837,\n[Lord Palmerston](/wiki/Henry_John_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston \"Henry John\nTemple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston\") and [John\nHobhouse](/wiki/John_Hobhouse,_1st_Baron_Broughton \"John Hobhouse, 1st Baron\nBroughton\"), fearing the instability of [Afghanistan](/wiki/Afghanistan\n\"Afghanistan\"), the [Sindh](/wiki/Sindh \"Sindh\"), and the increasing power of\nthe [Sikh kingdom](/wiki/Sikh_Empire \"Sikh Empire\") to the northwest, raised\nthe spectre of a possible Russian invasion of [British\nIndia](/wiki/Company_rule_in_India \"Company rule in India\") through\nAfghanistan. The [Russian Empire](/wiki/Russian_Empire \"Russian Empire\") was\nslowly extending its domain into Central Asia, and this was seen by the [East\nIndia Company](/wiki/East_India_Company \"East India Company\") as a possible\nthreat to their interests in India. In 19th century Russia, there was the\nideology of Russia's \"special mission in the East\", namely Russia had the\n\"duty\" to conquer much of Asia, through this was more directed against the\nnations of Central Asia and the alleged \"Yellow Peril\" of China than India.[9]\nThe British tended to misunderstand the foreign policy of the Emperor Nicholas\nI as anti-British and intent upon an expansionary policy in Asia; whereas in\nfact though Nicholas disliked Britain as a liberal democratic state that he\nconsidered to be rather \"strange\", he always believed it was possible to reach\nan understanding with Britain on spheres of influence in Asia, believing that\nthe essentially conservative nature of British society would retard the advent\nof liberalism.[10] The main goal of Nicholas's foreign policy was not the\nconquest of Asia, but rather upholding the _status quo_ in Europe, especially\nby co-operating with Prussia and Austria, and in isolating France, as [Louis\nPhilippe I](/wiki/Louis_Philippe_I \"Louis Philippe I\"), the King of the French\nwas a man who Nicholas hated as an \"usurper\".[11] The duc d'Orleans had once\nbeen Nicholas's friend, but when he assumed the throne of France after the\nrevolution of 1830, Nicholas was consumed with hatred for his former friend\nwhom, as he saw it, had gone over to what he perceived as the dark side of\nliberalism.[12]\n\nThe Company sent an envoy to [Kabul](/wiki/Kabul \"Kabul\") to form an alliance\nwith Afghanistan's Amir, [Dost Mohammad Khan](/wiki/Dost_Mohammad_Khan \"Dost\nMohammad Khan\") against Russia.[13][14] Dost Mohammad had recently lost\nAfghanistan's second capital of [Peshawar](/wiki/Peshawar \"Peshawar\") to the\n[Sikh Empire](/wiki/Sikh_Empire \"Sikh Empire\") and was willing to form an\nalliance with Britain if they gave support to retake it, but the British were\nunwilling. Instead, the British feared the French-trained [_Dal\nKhalsa_](/wiki/Dal_Khalsa_\\(Sikh_Army\\) \"Dal Khalsa \\(Sikh Army\\)\"), and they\nconsidered the Sikh army to be a far more formidable threat than the Afghans\nwho did not have an army at all, instead having only a tribal levy where under\nthe banner of _jihad_ tribesmen would come out to fight for the Emir.[15] The\n_Dal Khalsa_ was an enormous force that had been trained by French officers,\nwas equipped with modern weapons and was widely considered to be one of the\nmost powerful armies on the entire Indian subcontinent. For this reason, Lord\nAuckland preferred an alliance with the Punjab over an alliance with\nAfghanistan, which had nothing equivalent to the _Dal Khalsa_.[15] The British\ncould have had an alliance with the Punjab or Afghanistan, but not both at the\nsame time.[15] When [Governor-General of India](/wiki/Governor-\nGeneral_of_India \"Governor-General of India\") [Lord\nAuckland](/wiki/George_Eden,_1st_Earl_of_Auckland \"George Eden, 1st Earl of\nAuckland\") heard about the arrival of Russian envoy Count [Jan Prosper\nWitkiewicz](/wiki/Jan_Prosper_Witkiewicz \"Jan Prosper Witkiewicz\") (better\nknown by the Russian version of his name as [Yan\nVitkevich](/wiki/Yan_Vitkevich \"Yan Vitkevich\")) in Kabul and the possibility\nthat Dost Mohammad might turn to Russia for support, his political advisers\nexaggerated the threat.[5] Burnes described Witkiewicz: \"He was a gentlemanly\nand agreeable man, of about thirty years of age, spoke French, Turkish and\nPersian fluently, and wore the uniform of an officer of the Cossacks\".[16] The\npresence of Witkiewicz had thrown Burnes into a state of despair, leading one\ncontemporary to note that he \"abandoned himself to despair, bound his head\nwith wet towels and handkerchiefs and took to the smelling bottle\".[16] Dost\nMohammad had in fact invited Count Witkiewicz to Kabul as a way to frighten\nthe British into making an alliance with him against his archenemy [Ranjit\nSingh](/wiki/Ranjit_Singh \"Ranjit Singh\"), the Maharaja of the Punjab, not\nbecause he really wanted an alliance with Russia. The British had the power to\ncompel Singh to return the former Afghan territories he had conquered whereas\nthe Russians did not, which explains why Dost Mohammad Khan wanted an alliance\nwith the British. Alexander Burnes, the Scotsman who served as the East India\nCompany's chief political officer in Afghanistan wrote home after having\ndinner with Count Witkiewicz and Dost Mohammad in late December 1837: \"We are\nin a mess home. The emperor of Russia has sent an envoy to Kabul to\noffer...money [to the Afghans] to fight Rajeet Singh!!! I could not believe my\nown eyes or ears.\"[15] On 20 January 1838, Lord Auckland sent an ultimatum to\nDost Mohammad telling him: \"You must desist from all correspondence with\nRussia. You must never receive agents from them, or have aught to do with them\nwithout our sanction; you must dismiss Captain Viktevitch [Witkiewicz] with\ncourtesy; you must surrender all claims to Peshawar\".[17] Burnes himself had\ncomplained that Lord Auckland's letter was \"so dictatorial and supercilious as\nto indicate the writer's intention that it should give offense\", and tried to\navoid delivering it for long as possible.[18] Dost Mohammad was indeed\noffended by the letter, but in order to avoid a war, he had his special\nmilitary advisor, the American adventurer [Josiah Harlan](/wiki/Josiah_Harlan\n\"Josiah Harlan\") engage in talks with Burnes to see if some compromise could\nbe arranged.[19] Burnes was in fact had no power to negotiate anything, and\nHarlan complained that Burnes was just stalling, which led to Dost Mohammad\nexpelling the British diplomatic mission on 26 April 1838.[19]\n\nBritish fears of a Russian invasion of India took one step closer to becoming\na reality when negotiations between the Afghans and Russians broke down in\n1838. The [Qajar dynasty](/wiki/Qajar_dynasty \"Qajar dynasty\") of Persia, with\nRussian support, attempted the [Siege of Herat](/wiki/Siege_of_Herat_\\(1838\\)\n\"Siege of Herat \\(1838\\)\").[6] Herat is a city that had historically belonged\nto Persia that the Qajar shahs had long desired to take back and is located in\na plain so fertile that is known as the \"Granary of Central Asia\"; whoever\ncontrols Heret and the surrounding countryside also controls the largest\nsource of grain in all of Central Asia.[20] Russia, wanting to increase its\npresence in Central Asia, had formed an alliance with [Qajar\nPersia](/wiki/Qajar_Persia \"Qajar Persia\"), which had territorial disputes\nwith Afghanistan as Herat had been part of the [Safavid\nPersia](/wiki/Safavid_Persia \"Safavid Persia\") before 1709. Lord Auckland's\nplan was to drive away the besiegers and replace Dost Mohammad with [Shuja\nShah Durrani](/wiki/Shuja_Shah_Durrani \"Shuja Shah Durrani\"), who had once\nruled Afghanistan and who was willing to ally himself with anyone who might\nrestore him to the Afghan throne. At one point, Shuja had hired an American\nadventurer [Josiah Harlan](/wiki/Josiah_Harlan \"Josiah Harlan\") to overthrow\nDost Mohammad Khan, despite the fact Harlan's military experience comprised\nonly working as a surgeon with the East India Company's troops in First Burma\nWar.[21] Shuja Shah had been deposed in 1809 and been living in exile in\nBritish India since 1818, collecting a pension from the East India Company,\nwhich believed that he might be useful one day.[15] The British denied that\nthey were invading Afghanistan, claiming they were merely supporting its\n\"legitimate\" Shuja government \"against foreign interference and factious\nopposition.\"[3] Shuja Shah by 1838 was barely remembered by most of his former\nsubjects and those that did viewed him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler who, as\nthe British were soon to learn, had almost no popular support in\nAfghanistan.[22]\n\nOn October 1, 1838 Lord Auckland issued the Simla Declaration attacking Dost\nMohammed Khan for making \"an unprovoked attack\" on the empire of \"our ancient\nally, Maharaja Ranjeet Singh\", going on to declare that Suja Shah was \"popular\nthroughout Afghanistan\" and would enter his former realm \"surrounded by his\nown troops and be supported against foreign interference and factious\nopposition by the British Army\".[22] As the Persians had broken off the siege\nof Herat and the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia had ordered Count Vitkevich home\n(he was to commit suicide upon reaching St. Petersburg), the reasons for\nattempting to put Shuja Shah back on the Afghan throne had vanished.[6] The\nBritish historian Sir [John William Kaye](/wiki/John_William_Kaye \"John\nWilliam Kaye\") wrote that the failure of the Persians to take Herat \"cut from\nunder the feet of Lord Auckland all ground of justification and rendered the\nexpedition across the Indus at once a folly and a crime\".[22] But this point,\nAuckland was committed to putting Afghanistan into the British sphere of\ninfluence and nothing would stop him from going ahead with the invasion.[22]\nOn 25 November 1838, the two most powerful armies on the Indian subcontinent\nassembled in a grand review at Ferozepore as [Ranjit Singh](/wiki/Ranjit_Singh\n\"Ranjit Singh\"), the Maharajah of the Punjab brought out the _Dal Khalsa_ to\nmarch alongside the sepoy troops of the East India Company and the British\ntroops in India with Lord Auckland himself present amid much colorful\npageantry and music as men dressed in brightly colored uniforms together with\nhorses and elephants marched in an impressive demonstration of military\nmight.[23] Lord Auckland declared that the \"Grand Army of the Indus\" would now\nstart the march on Kabul to depose Dost Mohammed and put Shuja Shah back on\nthe Afghan throne, ostensibly because the latter was the rightful Emir, but in\nreality to place Afghanistan into the British sphere of influence.[6] The Duke\nof Wellington speaking in the House of Lords condemned the invasion, saying\nthat the real difficulties would only begin after the invasion's success,\npredicating that Anglo-Indian force would rout the Afghan tribal levy, but\nthen find themselves struggling to hold on given the terrain of the Hindu Kush\nmountains and Afghanistan had no modern roads, calling the entire operation\n\"stupid\" given that Afghanistan was a land of \"rocks, sands, deserts, ice and\nsnow\".[22]\n\n## Forces[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Anglo-\nAfghan_War&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Forces\")]\n\nBritish India at this time was a proprietary colony run by the [East India\nCompany](/wiki/British_East_India_Company \"British East India Company\"), which\nhad been granted the right to rule India by the British Crown.[24] India was\nonly one of several proprietary colonies in the British Empire around the\nworld, where various corporations or individuals had been granted the right to\nrule by the Crown, with for instance Rupert's Land, which was a vast tract\ncovering most of what is now Canada being ruled by the Hudson's Bay Company,\nbut India was easily the most wealthy and profitable of all the proprietary\ncolonies. By the 19th century, the East India Company ruled 90 million Indians\nand controlled 70m acres (243,000 square kilometres) of land under its own\nflag while issuing its own currency, making it into the most powerful\ncorporation in the world.[25] The East India Company had been granted\nmonopolies on trade by the Crown, but it was not owned by the Crown, through\nthe shares in the East India Company were owned by numerous MPs and\naristocrats, creating a powerful Company lobby in Parliament while the Company\nregularly gave \"gifts\" to influential people in Britain.[25] The East India\nCompany was sufficiently wealthy to maintain the three [Presidency\narmies](/wiki/Presidency_armies \"Presidency armies\"), known after their\npresidencies as the [Bengal Army](/wiki/Bengal_Army \"Bengal Army\"), the\n[Bombay Army](/wiki/Bombay_Army \"Bombay Army\") and the [Madras\nArmy](/wiki/Madras_Army \"Madras Army\"), with the supreme field headquarters\nfor commanding these armies being at [Simla](/wiki/Shimla \"Shimla\").[22] The\nEast India Company's army totaled 200,000 men, making it one of the largest\narmies in the entire world, and was an army larger than those maintained by\nmost European states.[25] The majority of the men serving in the presidency\narmies were Indian, but the officers were all British, trained at the East\nIndia Company's own officer school at the [Addiscombe\nestate](/wiki/Addiscombe_Military_Seminary \"Addiscombe Military Seminary\")\noutside of London.[26] Furthermore, the politically powerful East India\nCompany had regiments from the British Army sent to India to serve alongside\nthe East India Company's army.[26] Officers from the British Army serving in\nIndia tended to look down on officers serving in the Company's army as\nmercenaries and misfits, and relations between the two armies were cool at\nbest.[26]\n\nThe regiments chosen for the invasion of Afghanistan came from the Bengal and\nBombay armies.[26] The commander in India, Sir [Henry\nFane](/wiki/Henry_Fane_\\(British_Army_officer\\) \"Henry Fane \\(British Army\nofficer\\)\") chose the regiments by drawing lots, which led to the best British\nregiment, the Third Foot, being excluded while the worst, the Thirteenth Light\nInfantry were included in the Grand Army of the Indus.[26] The units from the\nBengal Army going into Afghanistan were Skinner's Horse, the Forty-third\nNative Infantry and the Second Light Cavalry, which were all Company regiments\nwhile the Sixteenth Lancers and the Thirteenth Light Infantry came from the\nBritish Army in India.[26] The units from the Bombay Army chosen for the Grand\nArmy of the Indus were the Nineteenth Native Infantry and the Poona Local\nHorse, which were Company regiments, and the Second Foot battalion of the\nColdstream Guards, the Seventeenth Foot, and the Fourth Dragoons, which were\nall British Army regiments.[26] Of the two divisions of the Grand Army of the\nIndus, the Bombay division numbered fifty-six hundred men and the Bengal\ndivision numbered ninety-five hundred men.[26] Shuja recruited 6, 000 Indian\nmercenaries out of his pocket for the invasion.[26] Ranjit Singh, the elderly\nand ailing Maharaja of the Punjab was supposed to contribute several divisions\nfrom the _Dal Khasla_ to the Grand Army of the Indus, but reneged on his\npromises, guessing that the Anglo-Indian force was sufficient to depose his\narchenemy Dost Mohammad, and he did not wish to occur the expenses of a war\nwith Afghanistan.[15] Accompanying the invasion force were 38,000 Indian camp\nfollowers and 30,000 camels to carry supplies.[26]\n\nThe Emirate of Afghanistan had no army, and instead under the Afghan feudal\nsystem, the tribal chiefs contributed fighting men when the Emir called upon\ntheir services.[27] The Afghans were divided into numerous ethnic groups, of\nwhich the largest were the Pashtuns, the Tajiks, the Uzbeks, and the Hazaras,\nwho were all in their turn divided into numerous tribes and clans. Islam was\nthe sole unifying factor binding these groups together, through the Hazaras\nwere Shia Muslims while the rest were Sunni Muslims. The Pashtuns were the\ndominant ethnic group, and it was with the Pashtun tribes that the British\ninteracted with the most. The Pashtun tribesmen had no military training, but\nthe ferociously warlike Pashtuns were forever fighting each other, when not\nbeing called up for service for the tribal levy by the Emir, meaning most\nPashtun men had at least some experience of warfare.[15] The Pashtun tribes\nlived by their strict moral code of _[Pashtunwali](/wiki/Pashtunwali\n\"Pashtunwali\")_ (\"the way of the Pashtuns\") stating various rules for a\nPashtun man to live by, one of which was that a man had to avenge any insult,\nreal or imagined, with violence, in order to be considered a man. The standard\nAfghan weapon was a matchlock rifle known as a _juzail_.[15]\n\n## British Indian invasion of\nAfghanistan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Anglo-\nAfghan_War&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: British Indian invasion of\nAfghanistan\")]\n\n### Into Afghanistan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Anglo-\nAfghan_War&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Into Afghanistan\")]\n\nMain article: [Battle of Ghazni](/wiki/Battle_of_Ghazni \"Battle of Ghazni\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sir_-_I_-\nKhajur_in_the_Bolan_Pass%2C_1839.jpg/220px-Sir_-_I_-\nKhajur_in_the_Bolan_Pass%2C_1839.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sir_-_I_-\nKhajur_in_the_Bolan_Pass,_1839.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sir_-_I_-Khajur_in_the_Bolan_Pass,_1839.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSir – I – Khajur in the Bolan Pass, 1839\n\nThe \"Army of the Indus\". which included 21,000 British and Indian troops under\nthe command of [John Keane, 1st Baron Keane](/wiki/John_Keane,_1st_Baron_Keane\n\"John Keane, 1st Baron Keane\") (subsequently replaced by [Sir Willoughby\nCotton](/wiki/Willoughby_Cotton \"Willoughby Cotton\") and then by [William\nElphinstone](/wiki/William_Elphinstone_\\(major-general\\) \"William Elphinstone\n\\(major-general\\)\")) set out from [Punjab](/wiki/Punjab_region \"Punjab\nregion\") in December 1838.

After reaching Kandahar, Keane decided to wait\nfor the crops to ripen before resuming his march, so it was not until 27 June\nthat the Grand Army of the Indus marched again.[29] Keane left behind his\nsiege engines in Kandahar, which turned out to be a mistake as he discovered\nthat the walls of the Ghazni fortress were far stronger than he expected.[29]\nA deserter, Abdul Rashed Khan, a nephew of Dost Mohammad Khan, informed the\nBritish that one of the gates of the fortress was in bad state of repair and\nmight be blasted open with a gunpowder charge.[29] Before the fortress, the\nBritish were attacked by a force of the [Ghilji](/wiki/Ghilji \"Ghilji\")\ntribesmen fighting under the banner of _jihad_ who were desperate to kill\n_farangis_ , a pejorative Pashtun term for the British and were beaten\noff.[30] The British took fifty prisoners who were brought before Shuja, where\none of them stabbed a minister to death with a hidden knife.[30] Shuja had\nthem all beheaded, which Sir John Kaye in his official history of the war to\nwrite this act of \"wanton barbarity\", the \"shrill cry\" of the _Ghazis_ would\nbe remembered as the \"funeral wail\" of the government's \"unholy policy\".[30]\n\nOn 22 July 1839, in a surprise attack, the British-led forces captured the\nfortress of [Ghazni](/wiki/Ghazni \"Ghazni\"), which overlooks a plain leading\neastward into the [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa](/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa \"Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa\"). The British troops blew up one city gate and marched into the\ncity in a euphoric mood. In taking this fortress, they suffered 200 men killed\nand wounded, while the Afghans lost nearly 500 men. 1,600 Afghans were taken\nprisoner with an unknown number wounded. Ghazni was well-supplied, which eased\nthe further advance considerably.\n\nFollowing this, the British achieved a decisive victory over Dost Mohammad's\ntroops, led by one of his sons. In August 1839, after thirty years, Shuja was\nagain enthroned in Kabul.

The Afghans resented\nthe British presence and the rule of Shah Shuja. As the occupation dragged on,\nthe East India Company's first political officer [William Hay\nMacnaghten](/wiki/William_Hay_Macnaghten \"William Hay Macnaghten\") allowed his\nsoldiers to bring their families to Afghanistan to improve morale;[34] this\nfurther infuriated the Afghans, as it appeared the British were setting up a\npermanent occupation.[35] Macnaughten purchased a mansion in Kabul, where he\ninstalled his wife, crystal chandelier, a fine selection of French wines, and\nhundreds of servants from India, making himself completely at home.[31]\nMacnaughten, who had once been a judge in a small town in Ulster before\ndeciding he wanted to be much more than a small town judge in Ireland, was\nknown for his arrogant, imperious manner, and was simply called \"the Envoy\" by\nboth the Afghans and the British.[31] The wife of one British officer, Lady\n[Florentia Sale](/wiki/Florentia_Sale \"Florentia Sale\") created an English\nstyle garden at her house in Kabul, which was much admired and in August 1841\nher daughter Alexadrina was married at her Kabul home to Lieutenant John Sturt\nof the Royal Engineers.[31] The British officers staged horse races, played\ncricket and in winter ice skating over the frozen local pounds, which\nastonished the Afghans who had never seen this before.[31]\n\nThe licentious conduct of the British troops greatly offended the puritanical\nvalues of the Afghan men who had always disapproved of premarital sex and were\nespecially enraged to see British infidels take their womenfolk to their\nbeds.[36] In his official history, Sir [John William\nKaye](/wiki/John_William_Kaye \"John William Kaye\") wrote he sadly had to\ndeclare \"there are truths which must be spoken\", namely there were\n\"temptations which are most difficult to withstand and were not withstood by\nour English officers\" as Afghan women were most attractive and those living in\nthe _zenanas_ (Islamic women's quarters) \"were not unwilling to visit the\nquarters of the Christian stranger\".[36] Kaye wrote the scandal was \"open,\nundisguised, notorious\" with British officers and soldiers openly having\nsexual relationships with Afghan women and in a nation like Afghanistan where\nwomen were and still are routinely killed in \"[honour\nkillings](/wiki/Honour_killing \"Honour killing\")\" for the mere suspicion of\nengaging in premarital sex which is seen as a slur against the manhood of\ntheir male family members, most Afghan men were highly furious at what they\nsaw as a national humiliation that had questioned their manhoods.[37] A\npopular ditty among the British troops was: \"A Kabul wife under burkha cover,\nWas never known without a lover\".[38] Some of these relationships ended in\nmarriage as Dost Mohammad's niece Jahan Begum married Captain Robert Warburton\nand a Lieutenant Lynch married the sister of a Ghilzai chief; the fact that\nboth women were very beautiful added to the humiliation of the Afghan men who\ndid not like to see their women fall in love with infidels.[38] One Afghan\nnobleman Mirza 'Ata wrote: \"The English drank the wine of shameless immodesty,\nforgetting that any act has its consequences and rewards-so that after a\nwhile, the spring garden of the King's regime was blighted by the autumn of\nthese ugly events...The nobles complained to each other, \"Day by day, we are\nexposed, because of the English, to deceit and lies and shame. Soon the women\nof Kabul will give birth to half-caste monkeys-it's a disgrace!\"\".[39]\nAfghanistan was such a desperately poor country that even the salary of a\nBritish private was considered to be a small fortune, and many Afghan women\nwillingly become prostitutes as an easy way to get rich, much to the intense\nfury of their menfolk.[40] The East India Company's second political officer\nSir [Alexander Burnes](/wiki/Alexander_Burnes \"Alexander Burnes\") was\nespecially noted for his insatiable womanizing, settling an example ardently\nimitated by his men.[37] 'Ata wrote: \"Burnes was especially shameless. In his\nprivate quarters, he would take a bath with his Afghan mistress in the hot\nwater of lust and pleasure, as the two rubbed each other down with flannels of\ngiddy joy and the talc of intimacy. Two _memsahibs_ , also his lovers, would\njoin them\".[41] Of all the aspects of the British occupation, it was sex\nbetween Afghan women and British soldiers that most infuriated Afghan men.[38]\n\nAfghanistan had no army, and instead had a feudal system under which the\nchiefs would maintain a certain number of armed retainers, principally cavalry\ntogether with a number of tribesmen who could be called upon to fight in a\ntime of war; when the Emir went to war, he would call upon his chiefs to bring\nout their men to fight for him.[42] In 1840, the British strongly pressured\nShuja to replace the feudal system with a standing army, which threatened to\ndo away with the power of the chiefs, and which the Emir rejected under the\ngrounds that Afghanistan lacked the financial ability to fund a standing\narmy.[43]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/The_army_of_the_Indus_entering_Kandahar.jpg/220px-\nThe_army_of_the_Indus_entering_Kandahar.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_army_of_the_Indus_entering_Kandahar.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_army_of_the_Indus_entering_Kandahar.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBritish army entering [Kandahar](/wiki/Kandahar \"Kandahar\")\n\nDost Mohammad unsuccessfully attacked the British and their Afghan protégé\nShuja, and subsequently surrendered and was exiled to India in late 1840. In\n1839–40, the entire rationale for the occupation of Afghanistan was changed by\nthe Oriental Crisis when Mohammad Ali the Great, the _vali_ (governor) of\nEgypt who was a close French ally, rebelled against the Sublime Porte; during\nthe subsequent crisis, Russia and Britain co-operated against France, and with\nthe improvement in Anglo-Russian relations, the need for a buffer state in\nCentral Asia decreased.[44] The Oriental Crisis of 1840 almost caused an\nAnglo-French war, which given the long-standing Franco-Russian rivalry caused\nby Nicholas's detestation of Louis-Philippe as a traitor to the conservative\ncause, inevitably improved relations between London and St. Petersburg, which\nultimately led to the Emperor Nicholas making an imperial visit to London in\n1844 to meet Queen Victoria and the Prime Minister Lord Peel. As early as\n1838, Count [Karl Nesselrode](/wiki/Karl_Nesselrode \"Karl Nesselrode\") the\nRussian Foreign Minister had suggested to the British Ambassador in St.\nPetersburg [Lord\nClanricarde](/wiki/Ulick_de_Burgh,_1st_Marquess_of_Clanricarde \"Ulick de\nBurgh, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde\") that Britain and Russia sign a treaty\ndelimiting spheres of influence in Asia to end the \"Great Game\" once and for\nall.[45] By 1840 Clanricarde was reporting to London that he was quite certain\na mutually satisfactory agreement could be negotiated, and all he needed was\nthe necessary permission from the Foreign Office to begin talks.[46] From\nCalcutta, Lord Auckland pressed for acceptance of the Russian offer, writing\n\"I would look forward to a tripartite Treaty of the West under which a limit\nshall be placed to the advance of England, Russia and Persia and under which\nall shall continue to repress slave dealing and plunder\".[46] Through Britain\nrejected the Russian offer, after 1840 there was a marked decline in Anglo-\nRussian rivalry and a \"fair working relationship in Asia\" had developed.[46]\nThe British Foreign Secretary [Lord\nPalmerston](/wiki/Henry_John_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston \"Henry John\nTemple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston\") rejected the Russian offer to end the \"Great\nGame\" as he believed that as long the \"Great Game\" continued, Britain could\ninconvenience Russia in Asia to better achieve her foreign policy goals in\nEurope much more than Russia could inconvenience Britain in Asia to achieve\nher foreign policy goals in Europe.[46] Palmerston noted that because the\nBritish had more money to bribe local rulers in Central Asia, this gave them\nthe advantage in this \"game\", and it was thus better to keep the \"Great Game\"\ngoing.[46] Palmerston believed it was Britain that held the advantage in the\n\"Great Game\", that the Russian offer to definitely mark out spheres of\ninfluence in Asia was a sign of weakness and he preferred no such treaty be\nsigned.[46] From Palmerston's viewpoint accepting the Russian offer would be\nunwelcome as the end of the \"Great Game\" in Asia would mean the redeployment\nof Russian power to Europe, the place that really counted for him, and it was\nbetter to keep the \"Great Game\" going, albeit at a reduced rate given the\ntensions with France.[46] At the same time, the lowering of Anglo-Russian\ntension in the 1840s made holding Afghanistan more of an expensive luxury from\nthe British viewpoint as it not longer seemed quite as essential to have a\nfriendly government in Kabul anymore.[46]\n\nBy this time, the British had vacated the fortress of [Bala\nHissar](/wiki/Bala_Hissar,_Kabul \"Bala Hissar, Kabul\") and relocated to a\n[cantonment](/wiki/Cantonment \"Cantonment\") built to the northeast of Kabul.\nThe chosen location was indefensible, being low and swampy with hills on every\nside. To make matters worse, the cantonment was too large for the number of\ntroops camped in it and had a defensive perimeter almost two miles long. In\naddition, the stores and supplies were in a separate fort, 300 yards from the\nmain cantonment.[47] The British commander, Major-General George Keith\nEphinstone who arrived in April 1841 was bed-ridden most of the time with gout\nand rheumatism.[48]\n\nBetween April and October 1841, disaffected Afghan tribes were flocking to\nsupport Dost Mohammad's son, [Akbar Khan](/wiki/Wazir_Akbar_Khan \"Wazir Akbar\nKhan\"), in Bamiyan and other areas north of the [Hindu Kush](/wiki/Hindu_Kush\n\"Hindu Kush\") mountains, organised into an effective resistance by chiefs such\nas [Mir Masjidi Khan](/wiki/Mir_Masjidi_Khan \"Mir Masjidi Khan\")[49] and\nothers. In September 1841, Macnaghten reduced the subsidies paid out to Ghazi\ntribal chiefs in exchange for accepting Shuja as Emir and to keep the passes\nopen, which immediately led to the Ghazis rebelling and a _jihad_ being\nproclaimed.[50] The monthly subsidies, which were effectively bribes for the\nGhazi chiefs to stay loyal, was reduced from 80,000 to 40,000 rupees at a time\nof rampant inflation, and as the chiefs' loyalty had been entirely financial,\nthe call of _jihad_ proved stronger.[50] Macnaughten did not take the threat\nseriously at first, writing to Henry Rawlinson in Kandahar on 7 October 1841:\n\"The Eastern Ghilzyes are kicking up a row about some deductions which have\nbeen made from their pay. The rascals have completely succeeded in cutting\ncommunications for the time being, which is very provoking to me at this time;\nbut they will be well trounced for their pains. One down, t'other come on, is\nthe principle of these vagabonds\".[51]\n\nMacnaughten ordered an expedition. On 10 October 1841, the Ghazis in a night\nraid defeated the Thirty-fifth Native Infantry, but were defeated the next day\nby the Thirteenth Light Infantry.[51] After their defeat, which led to the\nrebels fleeing to the mountains, Macnaughten overplayed his hand by demanding\nthat the chiefs who rebelled now send their children to Shuja's court as\nhostages to prevent another rebellion.[52] As Shuja had a habit of mutilating\npeople who displeased him in the slightest, Macnaghten's demand that the\nchildren of the chiefs go to the Emir's court was received with horror, which\nled the Ghazi chiefs to vow to fight on. Macnaghten who just been appointed\nthe governor of Bombay was torn between a desire to leave Afghanistan on a\nhigh note with country settled and peaceful vs. a desire to crush the Ghazis,\nwhich lead him to temporize, at one moment threatening the harshest reprisals\nand the next moment, compromising by abandoning his demand for hostages.[53]\nMacnaghten's alternating policy of confrontation and compromise was perceived\nas weakness, which encouraged the chiefs around Kabul to start rebelling.[54]\nShuja was so unpopular that many of his ministers and the Durrani clan joined\nthe rebellion[55]\n\nOn the night of 1 November 1841, a group of Afghan chiefs met at the Kabul\nhouse of one of their number to plan the uprising, which began in the morning\nof the next day.[51] In a flammable situation, the spark was provided\nunintentionally by Burnes. A Kashmiri slave girl who belonged to a Pashtun\nchief Abdullah Khan Achakzai living in Kabul ran away to Burnes's house. When\nAckakzai sent his retainers to retrieve her, it was discovered that Burnes had\ntaken the slave girl to his bed, and he had one of Azkakzai's men beaten.[56]\nA secret _jirga_ (council) of Pashtun chiefs was held to discuss this\nviolation of _pashtunwali_ , where Ackakzai holding a Koran in one hand\nstated: \"Now we are justified in throwing this English yoke; they stretch the\nhand of tyranny to dishonor private citizens great and small: fucking a slave\ngirl isn't worth the ritual bath that follows it: but we have to put a stop\nright here and now, otherwise these English will ride the donkey of their\ndesires into the field of stupidity, to the point of having all of us arrested\nand deported to a foreign field\".[56] At the end of his speech, all of the\nchiefs shouted \"_Jihad_ \".[56]\n\nLady Sale wrote in her diary on 2 November 1841: \"This morning early, all was\nin commotion in Kabul. The shops were plundered and the people all\nfighting.\"[57] That same day, a mob \"thirsting for blood\" appeared outside of\nthe house of the East India Company's second political officer, Sir [Alexander\n'Sekundar' Burnes](/wiki/Alexander_Burnes \"Alexander Burnes\"), where Burnes\nordered his sepoy guards not to fire while he stood outside haranguing the mob\nin Pashto, attempting to unconvincingly persuade the assembled men that he did\nnot bed their daughters and sisters.[58] Captain William Broadfoot who was\nwith Burnes saw the mob march forward, leading him to open fire with another\nofficer writing in his diary that he \"killed five or six men with his own hand\nbefore he was shot down\".[58] The mob smashed in to Burnes's hourse, where he,\nhis brother Charles, their wives and children, several aides and the sepoys\nwere all torn to pieces.[58] The mob then attacked the home of the paymaster\nJohnston who was not present, leading to later write when he surveyed the\nremains of his house that they \"gained possession of my treasury by\nundermining the wall...They murdered the whole of the guard (one officer and\n28 sepoys), all my servants (male, female, and children), plundered the\ntreasury...burnt all my office records...and possessed themselves of all my\nprivate property\".[58] The British forces took no action in response despite\nbeing only five minutes away, which encouraged further revolt.[58] The only\nperson who took action that day was Shuja who ordered out one of his regiments\nfrom the Bala Hissar commanded by an Scots mercenary named Campbell to crush\nthe riot, but the old city of Kabul with its narrow, twisting streets favored\nthe defensive with Campbell's men coming under fire from rebels in the houses\nabove.[59] After losing about 200 men killed, Campbell retreated back to the\nBala Hissar.[60] After hearing of the defeat of his regiment, Shuja descended\ninto what Kaye called \"a pitiable state of dejection and alarm\", sinking into\na deep state of depression as it finally dawned on him that his people hated\nhim and wanted to see him dead.[60] Captain Sturt was sent to the Bala Hissar\nby Elphinstone to if were possible to recover control of the city later that\nafternoon, where his mother-in-law Lady Sale noted in her diary: \"Just as he\nentered the precincts of the palace, he was stabbed in three places by a young\nman well dressed, who escaped into a building close-by, were he was protected\nby the gates being shut.\"[60] Sturt was sent home to be cared for by Lady Sale\nand his wife with the former noting: \"He was covered with blood issuing from\nhis mouth and was unable to articulate. He could not lie down, from the blood\nchoking him\", only being capable hours later to utter one word: \"bet-ter\".[60]\nLady Sale was highly critical of Elphinstone's leadership, writing: \"General\nElphinstone vacillates on every point. His own judgement appears to be good,\nbut he is swayed by the last speaker\", criticising him for \"...a very strange\ncircumstance that troops were not immediately sent into the city to quell the\naffair in the commencement, but we seem to sit quietly with out hands folded,\nand look on\"..\"[60] Despite both being in the cantonment, Elphinstone prefer\nto write letters to Macnaughten, with one letter on 2 November saying \"I have\nbeen considering what can done tomorrow\" (he decided to do nothing that day),\nstating \"our dilemma is a difficult one\", and finally concluding \"We must see\nwhat the morning brings\".[61] The British situation soon deteriorated when\nAfghans stormed the poorly defended supply fort inside Kabul on November 9.\n\nIn the following weeks the British commanders tried to negotiate with Akbar\nKhan. Macnaghten secretly offered to make Akbar Afghanistan's\n[vizier](/wiki/Vizier \"Vizier\") in exchange for allowing the British to stay,\nwhile simultaneously disbursing large sums of money to have him assassinated,\nwhich was reported to Akbar Khan.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] A\nmeeting for direct negotiations between Macnaghten and Akbar was held near the\ncantonment on 23 December, but Macnaghten and the three officers accompanying\nhim were seized and slain by Akbar Khan. Macnaghten's body was dragged through\nthe streets of Kabul and displayed in the bazaar.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nElphinstone had partly lost command of his troops already and his authority\nwas badly damaged.\n\n## Destruction of Elphinstone's army[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Anglo-\nAfghan_War&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Destruction of Elphinstone's\narmy\")]\n\nMain article: [1842 retreat from Kabul](/wiki/1842_retreat_from_Kabul \"1842\nretreat from Kabul\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Remnants_of_an_army2.jpg/350px-\nRemnants_of_an_army2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Remnants_of_an_army2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Remnants_of_an_army2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_[Remnants of an Army](/wiki/Remnants_of_an_Army \"Remnants of an Army\")_ by\n[Elizabeth Butler](/wiki/Elizabeth_Thompson \"Elizabeth Thompson\") depicting\nthe arrival of assistant surgeon, [William Brydon](/wiki/William_Brydon\n\"William Brydon\"), at [Jalalabad](/wiki/Jalalabad \"Jalalabad\") on 13 January\n1842.\n\nOn 1 January 1842, following some unusual thinking by\n[Elphinstone](/wiki/William_George_Keith_Elphinstone \"William George Keith\nElphinstone\"), which may have had something to do with the poor defensibility\nof the cantonment, an agreement was reached that provided for the safe exodus\nof the British garrison and its dependents from Afghanistan.[62] Five days\nlater, the withdrawal began. The departing British contingent numbered around\n16,500, of which about 4,500 were military personnel, and over 12,000 were\n[camp followers](/wiki/Camp_follower \"Camp follower\"). Lieutenant Eyre\ncommented about the camp followers that \"These proved from the very first mile\na serious clog on our movements\".[63] Lady Sale brought with her 40 servants,\nnone of whom she named in her diary while Lieutenant Eyre's son was saved by a\nfemale Afghan servant, who rode through an ambush with the boy on her back,\nbut he never gave her name.[63] The American historian James Perry noted:\n\"Reading the old diaries and journals, it is almost as if these twelve\nthousand native servants and sepoy wives and children didn't exist\nindividually. In a way, they really didn't. They would die, all of them-shot,\nstabbed, frozen to death-in these mountain passes, and no one bothered to\nwrite down the name of even one of them\".[63] The military force consisted\nmostly of Indian units and one British battalion, [44th Regiment of\nFoot](/wiki/44th_Regiment_of_Foot \"44th Regiment of Foot\").\n\nThey were attacked by [Ghilzai](/wiki/Ghilzai \"Ghilzai\") warriors as they\nstruggled through the snowbound passes. On the first day, the retreating force\nmade only five miles and as Lady Sale wrote about their arrival at a village\nof Begramee: \"There were no tents, save two or three small palls that arrived.\nEveryone scraped away the snow as best they might, to make a place to lie\ndown. The evening and night were intensely cold; no food for man or beast\nprocurable, except a few handful of _bhoosay_ [chopped stew], for which we had\nto pay five to ten rupees\".[64] As the night fell and with it the temperatures\ndropped well below freezing, the retreating force learned that they lost all\nof their supplies of food and their baggage.[65] On the second day all of the\nmen of the Royal Afghan Army's 6th regiment deserted, heading back to Kabul,\nmarking the end of the first attempt to give Afghanistan a national army.[64]\nFor several months afterwards, what had once been Shuja's army was reduced to\nbegging on the streets of Kabul as Akbar had of all of Shuja's mercenaries\nmutilated before throwing them on the streets to beg.[66] Despite Akbar Khan's\npromise of safe conduct, the Anglo-Indian force was repeatedly attack by the\nGhilzais, with one especially fierce Afghan attack being beaten off with a\nspirited bayonet charge by the 44th Foot.[64]\n\nWhile trying to cross the Koord-Kabual pass in the Hindu Kush that was\ndescribed as five miles long and \"so narrow and so shut in on either side that\nthe wintry sun rarely penetrates its gloomy recesses\", the Anglo-Indian force\nwas ambushed by the Ghilzai tribesmen.[67] Johnson described \"murderous fire\"\nthat forced the British to abandon all baggage while camp followers regardless\nof sex and age were cut down with swords.[68] Lady Sale wrote: \"Bullets kept\nwhizzing by us\" while some of the artillerymen smashed open the regimental\nstore of brandy to get drunk amid the Afghan attacks.[67] Lady Sale wrote she\ndrank a tumbler of sherry \"which at any other time would have made me very\nunlady-like, but now merely warmed me.\"[67] Lady Sale took a bullet in her\nwrist while she had to watch as her son-in-law Sturt had \"...his horse was\nshot out from him and before he could rise from the ground he received a\nsevere wound in the abdomen\".[67] With his wife and mother-in-law by his side\nin the snow, Sturt bled to death over the course of the night.[67] The gentle,\nkindly, but naive and gullible Elphinstone continued to believe that Akbar\nKhan was his \"ally\", and believed his promise that he would send out the\ncaptured supplies if he stopped the retreat on 8 January.[69] Adding to the\nmisery of the British, that night a ferocious blizzard blew in, causing\nhundreds to freeze to death.[70]\n\nOn 9 January 1842, Akbar sent out a messenger saying he was willing to take\nall of the British women as hostages, giving his word that they would not be\nharmed, and otherwise his tribesmen would show no mercy and kill all the women\nand children.[67] One of the British officers sent to negotiate with Akbar\nheard him say to his tribesmen in Dari (Afghan Farsi)-a language spoken by\nmany British officers-to \"spare\" the British while saying in Pashto-which most\nBritish officers did not speak-to \"slay them all\".[71] Lady Sale, her pregnant\ndaughter Alexandria and the rest of British women and children accepted\nAkbar's offer of safe conduct back to Kabul.[67] As the East India Company\nwould not pay a ransom for Indian women and children, Akbar refused to accept\nthem, and so the Indian women and children died with the rest of the force in\nthe Hindu Kush.[69] The camp followers captured by the Afghans were stripped\nof all their clothing and left to freeze to death in the snow.[72] Lady Sale\nwrote that as she was taken back to Kabul she noticed: \"The road was covered\nwith awful mangled bodies, all naked\".[73]\n\nIn the early morning of 10 January, the column resumed its march, with\neveryone tired, hungry and cold.[69] Most of the sepoys by this time had lost\na finger or two frostbite, and could not fire their guns.[74] At the narrow\npass of Tunghee Tareekee, which was 50 yards long, but 4 yards wide, the\nGhizye tribesmen ambushed the column, killing without mercy all of the camp\nfollowers, and the Anglo-Indian soldiers to fight their way over the corpses\nof the camp followers with heavy losses to themselves.[69] From a hill, Akbar\nKhan and his chiefs watched the slaughter from while sitting on their horses,\nbeing apparently very much amused by the carnage.[69] Captain Shelton and a\nfew soldiers from the 44th regiment held the rear of the column and fought off\nsuccessive Afghan attacks, despite being outnumbered.[69] Johnson described\nShelton as fighting like a \"bulldog\" with his sword, cutting down any Afghan\nwho tried to take on him so efficiently that by the end of the day no Afghan\nwould challenge him.[75] On the evening of 11 January 1842, General\nElphinstone, Captain Shelton, the paymaster Johnston, and Captain Skinner met\nwith Akbar Khan to ask him to stop his attacks on the column.[76] Akbar Khan\nprovided them with warm tea and a fine meal before telling them that they were\nall now his hostages as he reckoned the East India Company would pay good\nransoms for their freedom, and when Captain Skinner tried to resist, he was\nshot in the face.[76] Command now fell to Brigadier Thomas Anquetil.[76]\n\nThe evacuees were killed in huge numbers as they made their way down the 30\nmiles (48 km) of treacherous gorges and passes lying along the [Kabul\nRiver](/wiki/Kabul_River \"Kabul River\") between Kabul and\n[Gandamak](/wiki/Gandamak \"Gandamak\"), and [were\nmassacred](/wiki/Massacre_of_Elphinstone%27s_army \"Massacre of Elphinstone's\narmy\") at the [Gandamak](/wiki/Gandamak \"Gandamak\") pass before a survivor\nreached the besieged garrison at [Jalalabad](/wiki/Jalalabad \"Jalalabad\"). At\nGandamak, some 20 officers and 45 other ranks of the 44th Foot regiment,\ntogether with some artillerymen and sepoys, armed with some 20 muskets and two\nrounds of ammunition to every man, found themselves at dawn surrounded by\nAfghan tribesmen.[77] The force had been reduced to fewer than forty men by a\nwithdrawal from Kabul that had become, towards the end, a running battle\nthrough two feet of snow. The ground was frozen, the men had no shelter and\nhad little food for weeks. Of the weapons remaining to the survivors at\nGandamak, there were approximately a dozen working muskets, the officers'\npistols and a few swords. The British formed a square, defeated the first\ncouple of the Afghan attacks, \"driving the Afghans several times down the\nhill\" before running out of ammunition, fighting on with their bayonets and\nswords before being overwhelmed.[77] The Afghans took only 9 prisoners and\nkilled the rest.[78] The remnants of the 44th were all killed except Captain\nJames Souter, Sergeant Fair and seven soldiers who were taken prisoner.[79]\nThe only soldier to reach Jalalabad was Dr. [William\nBrydon](/wiki/William_Brydon \"William Brydon\") and several sepoys over the\nfollowing nights. Another source states that over one hundred British were\ntaken prisoner.[80]\n\nMany of the women and children were taken captive by the Afghan warring\ntribes; some of these women married their captors (one such lady was the wife\nof Captain Warburton), and children taken from the battlefield at the time\nwere later identified in the early part of the 20th century to be those of the\nfallen soldiers and who were brought up by Afghan families as their own\nchildren.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\n## Reprisals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Anglo-\nAfghan_War&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Reprisals\")]\n\nAt the same time as the attacks on the garrison at Kabul, Afghan forces\nbeleaguered the other British contingents in Afghanistan. These were at\nKandahar (where the largest British force in the country had been stationed),\n[Jalalabad](/wiki/Battle_of_Jellalabad \"Battle of Jellalabad\") (held by a\nforce which had been sent from Kabul in October 1841 as the first stage of a\nplanned withdrawal) and Ghazni. Ghazni was stormed, but the other garrisons\nheld out until relief forces arrived from India, in spring 1842. Akbar Khan\nwas defeated near Jalalabad and plans were laid for the recapture of Kabul and\nthe restoration of British hegemony.\n\nHowever, Lord Auckland had suffered a [stroke](/wiki/Stroke \"Stroke\") and had\nbeen replaced as governor-general by [Lord\nEllenborough](/wiki/Edward_Law,_1st_Earl_of_Ellenborough \"Edward Law, 1st Earl\nof Ellenborough\"), who was under instructions to bring the war to an end\nfollowing a change of government in Britain. Ellenborough ordered the forces\nat Kandahar and Jalalabad to leave Afghanistan after inflicting reprisals and\nsecuring the release of prisoners taken during the retreat from Kabul.\n\nIn August 1842 [General Nott](/wiki/William_Nott_\\(British_general\\) \"William\nNott \\(British general\\)\") advanced from Kandahar, pillaging the countryside\nand seizing Ghazni, whose fortifications he demolished. Meanwhile, [General\nPollock](/wiki/George_Pollock \"George Pollock\"), who had taken command of a\ndemoralized force in Peshawar used it to clear the [Khyber\nPass](/wiki/Khyber_Pass \"Khyber Pass\") to arrive at Jalalabad, where [General\nSale](/wiki/Robert_Sale \"Robert Sale\") had already lifted the siege. From\nJalalabad, General Pollock inflicted a further crushing defeat on Akbar Khan.\nThe combined British forces defeated all opposition before [taking\nKabul](/wiki/Battle_of_Kabul_\\(1842\\) \"Battle of Kabul \\(1842\\)\") in\nSeptember. A month later, having rescued the prisoners and demolished the\ncity's main bazaar as an act of retaliation for the destruction of\nElphinstone's column, they withdrew from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass.\nDost Muhammad was released and re-established his authority in Kabul. He died\non June 9, 1863. Dost Mohammad is reported to have said:\n\n> I have been struck by the magnitude of your resources, your ships, your\n> arsenals, but what I cannot understand is why the rulers of so vast and\n> flourishing an empire should have gone across the Indus to deprive me of my\n> poor and barren country.[80]\n\n## Legacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Anglo-\nAfghan_War&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Legacy\")]\n\nMany voices in Britain, from [Lord Aberdeen](/wiki/George_Hamilton-\nGordon,_4th_Earl_of_Aberdeen \"George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of\nAberdeen\")[86] to [Benjamin Disraeli](/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli \"Benjamin\nDisraeli\"), had criticized the war as rash and insensate. The perceived threat\nfrom Russia was vastly exaggerated, given the distances, the almost impassable\nmountain barriers, and logistical problems that an invasion would have to\nsolve. In the three decades after the First Anglo-Afghan War, the Russians did\nadvance steadily southward towards Afghanistan. In 1842 the Russian border was\non the other side of the [Aral Sea](/wiki/Aral_Sea \"Aral Sea\") from\nAfghanistan; but five years later the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar \"Tsar\")'s outposts had\nmoved to the lower reaches of the [Amu Darya](/wiki/Amu_Darya \"Amu Darya\"). By\n1865 [Tashkent](/wiki/Tashkent \"Tashkent\") had been formally annexed, as was\n[Samarkand](/wiki/Samarkand \"Samarkand\") three years later. A peace treaty in\n1873 with Amir [Alim Khan](/wiki/Mohammed_Alim_Khan \"Mohammed Alim Khan\") of\nthe [Manghit Dynasty](/wiki/Manghit#Manghit_Dynasty \"Manghit\"), the ruler of\n[Bukhara](/wiki/Bukhara \"Bukhara\"), virtually stripped him of his\nindependence. Russian control then extended as far as the northern bank of the\nAmu Darya.\n\nIn 1878, the British invaded again, beginning the [Second Anglo-Afghan\nWar](/wiki/Second_Anglo-Afghan_War \"Second Anglo-Afghan War\").\n\n[Lady Butler](/wiki/Elizabeth_Thompson \"Elizabeth Thompson\")'s famous painting\nof Dr. William Brydon, initially thought to be the sole survivor, gasping his\nway to the British outpost in [Jalalabad](/wiki/Jalalabad,_Afghanistan\n\"Jalalabad, Afghanistan\"), helped make Afghanistan's reputation as a graveyard\nfor foreign armies and became one of the great epics of empire.\n\nIn 1843 British army [chaplain](/wiki/Chaplain \"Chaplain\") G.R. Gleig wrote a\nmemoir of the disastrous (First) Anglo-Afghan War, of which he was one of the\nvery few survivors. He wrote that it was\n\n> a war begun for no wise purpose, carried on with a strange mixture of\n> rashness and timidity, brought to a close after suffering and disaster,\n> without much glory attached either to the government which directed, or the\n> great body of troops which waged it.
