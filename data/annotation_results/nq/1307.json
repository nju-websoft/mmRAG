Her mother, [Viva](/wiki/Viva_\\(actress\\) \"Viva \\(actress\\)\")\n(born Janet Susan Mary Hoffmann),[6] is an actress, writer and former [Warhol\nsuperstar](/wiki/Warhol_superstars \"Warhol superstars\"),[7] and her father,\n[Anthony Herrera](/wiki/Anthony_Herrera \"Anthony Herrera\"),[8] was a [soap\nopera](/wiki/Soap_opera \"Soap opera\") actor best known for his role as [James\nStenbeck](/wiki/James_Stenbeck \"James Stenbeck\") from _[As the World\nTurns](/wiki/As_the_World_Turns \"As the World Turns\")_.[9] Viva and Herrera\nwere estranged shortly after Hoffmann's birth; she was raised by her mother at\nthe [Chelsea Hotel](/wiki/Hotel_Chelsea \"Hotel Chelsea\") in New York. Her\nfather did not have a significant presence in her life.[10][11] Hoffmann's\nbirth is documented in [Brigid Berlin](/wiki/Brigid_Berlin \"Brigid Berlin\")'s\n_The Andy Warhol Diaries_. An entry dated January 10, 1982, two days after\nHoffmann was born, says that a friend of Warhol's telephoned Warhol and told\nhim that they were going to the Chelsea Hotel to see Viva and her new baby.\n\nHoffmann's mother was raised in a devout [Catholic](/wiki/Catholicism\n\"Catholicism\") family[11] on [Long Island](/wiki/Long_Island \"Long Island\"),\nthe daughter of an attorney.[12][13] She was previously married to director\n[Michel Auder](/wiki/Michel_Auder \"Michel Auder\") in 1969. Gaby has a half-\nsister, Alexandra \"Alex\" Auder, who is 11 years older.[14] Auder teaches yoga\nin New York City.[15] Hoffmann's father was raised in\n[Wiggins](/wiki/Wiggins,_Mississippi \"Wiggins, Mississippi\"),\n[Mississippi](/wiki/Mississippi \"Mississippi\") by his maternal grandparents;\nhis own father, Gaby's biological great-grandfather was referenced, viewed,\nand stated on the PBS series, Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr.\nSeason 4, Episode 8, to be Gaston L Malecot. An instructor at Columbia\nUniversity and a World War 1 veteran.[1] Herrera died in 2011 from cancer.[9]\n\nHoffmann attended elementary school in Manhattan at P.S. 3 on Hudson Street in\nthe [West Village](/wiki/West_Village \"West Village\"), then another school in\n[Hell's Kitchen](/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen \"Hell's Kitchen\"). After she moved to\nLos Angeles in 1994, she attended the [Buckley\nSchool](/wiki/Buckley_School_\\(California\\) \"Buckley School \\(California\\)\"),\nbefore finally graduating from [Calabasas High\nSchool](/wiki/Calabasas_High_School \"Calabasas High School\") in 1999.[2]\n\n### Life at the Chelsea\nHotel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gaby_Hoffmann&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Life at the Chelsea Hotel\")]\n\nUntil July 1993, Hoffmann lived in Manhattan's Chelsea Hotel (now a landmark),\nwhich Hoffmann later said she enjoyed. According to Hoffmann, she and her best\nfriend Talya Shomron would roller-skate in the hallways, spy on the drug\ndealer across the hall, and persuade the [bellman](/wiki/Bellhop \"Bellhop\") to\ngo to the neighborhood [delicatessen](/wiki/Delicatessen \"Delicatessen\") at\nnight to fetch them ice cream.[10]\n\nHoffmann recalled, \"I grew up in downtown New York in the '80s. I have a\nfriend who grew up with me, and she puts it well. She says, 'If you grew up\nwhere we grew up, if you weren't an artist, a [drag queen](/wiki/Drag_queen\n\"Drag queen\"), [queer](/wiki/Queer \"Queer\"), or a drug addict, then you were\nthe freak [unusual one].' I grew up in a world where I guess what is\nconsidered unusual or abnormal for the rest of America was very much\nconsidered the norm.\"[3] She also reported in an interview that there had been\ngunfire and a rape at the hotel shortly before they moved out of it.[11]\n\nHoffmann and her mother left the Chelsea Hotel after a long-standing dispute\nwith the management that ended in eviction.[11] Regardless, Gaby's connection\nto the hotel resulted in a significant effect on her future. The idea for the\n1994 sitcom _[Someone Like Me](/wiki/Someone_Like_Me \"Someone Like Me\")_\noriginated after [Gail Berman](/wiki/Gail_Berman \"Gail Berman\") (former\npresident of [Viacom](/wiki/Viacom \"Viacom\")'s [Paramount\nPictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\")) read a _[New York\nTimes](/wiki/New_York_Times \"New York Times\")_ article[14] about the hotel\nwhich referred to a children's book that Viva and friend Jane Lancellotti\nwrote, _Gaby at the Chelsea_ (a take on [Kay Thompson](/wiki/Kay_Thompson \"Kay\nThompson\")'s 1950s classic [Eloise](/wiki/Eloise_\\(books\\) \"Eloise \\(books\\)\")\nbooks).

She interned with a chef in\nItaly, and then trained to be a [doula](/wiki/Doula \"Doula\") after helping\ndeliver Alex's children. For a time, Hoffmann and a boyfriend lived in an old\ntrailer in the [Catskill Mountains](/wiki/Catskill_Mountains \"Catskill\nMountains\").[14]\n\n##\nCareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gaby_Hoffmann&action=edit&section=5&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Career\")]\n\n### Childhood acting\ncareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gaby_Hoffmann&action=edit&section=6&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\n\"Edit section: Childhood acting career\")]\n\nHoffmann began her acting career at the age of four to help pay the family\nbills by acting in commercials.

However, she grew tired of\nthe rigors of screen performance and temporarily retired. Nevertheless, upon\nhearing that Culkin (whom she disliked when they worked together[11]) was\nmaking a lot of money in feature films, her \"competitive spirit got the best\nof her,\" as she later put it, and she re-entered the profession.

They can’t\nimagine that people would want to be anything other than that. When they are,\nit's looked at as almost a political statement. Look at [Lena\nDunham](/wiki/Lena_Dunham \"Lena Dunham\"). She is a gorgeous woman and people\ncan't stop talking about how brave she is to show herself naked, which I find\ntotally condescending and ridiculous. If [Angelina Jolie](/wiki/Angelina_Jolie\n\"Angelina Jolie\") was naked onscreen no one would say she was brave. The\nimplication is that Lena's brave because she doesn't look the way she's\nsupposed to look.
