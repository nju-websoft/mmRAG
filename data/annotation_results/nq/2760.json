The core of the bay has an area of 334 km2 with a\nhigh density of 775 islets.[1] The limestone in this bay has gone through 500\nmillion years of formation in different conditions and environments. The\nevolution of the karst in this bay has taken 20 million years under the impact\nof the tropical wet climate.[2] The geo-diversity of the environment in the\narea has created [biodiversity](/wiki/Biodiversity \"Biodiversity\"), including\na tropical [evergreen](/wiki/Evergreen \"Evergreen\")\n[biosystem](/wiki/Biosystem \"Biosystem\"), oceanic and sea shore biosystem.[3]\nHa Long Bay is home to 14 endemic floral species[4] and 60 endemic faunal\nspecies.[5]\n\nHistorical research surveys have shown the presence of prehistoric human\nbeings in this area tens of thousands years ago. The successive ancient\ncultures are the Soi Nhu culture around 18,000–7000 BC, the Cai Beo culture\n7000–5000 BC[6] and the Ha Long culture 5,000–3,500 years ago.[7] Ha Long Bay\nalso marked important events in the [history of\nVietnam](/wiki/History_of_Vietnam \"History of Vietnam\") with many artifacts\nfound in Bai Tho Mountain, Dau Go Cave, Bai Chay.[7]\n\n500 years ago, [Nguyen Trai](/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_Tr%C3%A3i \"Nguyễn Trãi\")\npraised the beauty of Ha Long Bay in his verse _Lộ nhập Vân Đồn_ , in which he\ncalled it \"rock wonder in the sky\".[8] In 1962, the Ministry of Culture,\nSports and Tourism of North Vietnam listed Ha Long Bay in the National Relics\nand Landscapes publication.[9] In 1994, the core zone of Ha Long Bay was\nlisted as a World Heritage Site according to Criterion VII, and listed for a\nsecond time according to Criterion VIII.[10]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Etymology\n  * 2 Overview\n    * 2.1 Location\n    * 2.2 Climate\n    * 2.3 Population\n  * 3 History\n    * 3.1 Soi Nhu culture (16,000–5000 BC)\n    * 3.2 Cai Beo culture (5000–3000 BC)\n    * 3.3 Feudal period\n  * 4 Geology and geomorphology\n    * 4.1 History of tectonics\n    * 4.2 Karst geomorphology value\n    * 4.3 Timeline of geologic evolution\n  * 5 Ecology\n    * 5.1 Environmental damage\n  * 6 Awards and designations\n  * 7 In literature\n    * 7.1 Ancient tales\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nEtymology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=H%E1%BA%A1_Long_Bay&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Etymology\")]\n\nThe name _Ha Long_ means \"descending dragon\".\n\nBefore 19th century, the name Ha Long Bay had not been recorded in the old\nbooks of the country. It has been called An Bang, Luc Thuy, Van Don... In the\nlate 19th century, the name Ha Long Bay appeared on the Maritime Map of\nFrance. The French-language _Hai Phong News_ reported \"Dragon appears on Ha\nLong Bay\".\n\nAccording to local legend, when Vietnam had just started to develop into a\ncountry, they had to fight against invaders. To assist the Vietnamese in\ndefending their country, the gods sent a family of [dragons](/wiki/Dragon\n\"Dragon\") as protectors. This family of dragons began spitting out jewels and\n[jade](/wiki/Jade \"Jade\"). These jewels turned into the islands and islets\ndotting the bay, linking together to form a great wall against the invaders.\nUnder magics, numerous rock mountains abruptly appeared on the sea, ahead of\ninvaders' ships; the forward ships struck the rocks and each other. After\nwinning the battle, the dragons were interested in peaceful sightseeing of the\nEarth, and then decided to live in this bay. The place where the mother dragon\ndescended was named Ha Long, the place where the dragon's children attended\nupon their mother was called Bai Tu Long island (_Bai_ : attend upon, _Tu_ :\nchildren, _Long_ : dragon), and the place where the dragon's children wriggled\ntheir tails violently was called Bach Long Vy island (_Bach_ : white-color of\nthe foam made when Dragon's children wriggled, _Long_ : dragon, _Vy_ : tail),\npresent day Tra Co peninsula, [Mong Cai](/wiki/M%C3%B3ng_C%C3%A1i \"Móng\nCái\").[11]\n\n##\nOverview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=H%E1%BA%A1_Long_Bay&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Thien_Cung.jpg/250px-\nThien_Cung.jpg)](/wiki/File:Thien_Cung.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Thien_Cung.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThien Cung grotto\n\nThe bay consists of a dense cluster of some 1,600[12]\n[limestone](/wiki/Limestone \"Limestone\") monolithic islands each topped with\nthick jungle vegetation, rising spectacularly from the ocean.

These\nislands range from tens to thousands of hectares in size, mainly in the East\nand Southeast of Ha Long Bay. In recent decades, thousands of villagers have\nbeen starting to settle down on the pristine islands and build new communities\nsuch as Sa Tô Island (Hạ Long City), Thắng Lợi Island (Vân Đồn district).\n\nThe population of Ha Long Bay is about 1,540, mainly in Cửa Vạn, Ba Hang and\nCặp Dè fishing villages (Hùng Thắng Ward, Hạ Long City). Residents of the bay\nmostly live on boats and rafts to facilitate the fishing, cultivating and\nbreeding of aquatic and marine species. Today the life of Ha Long Bay\ninhabitants has much improved due to new travel businesses.\n\nAt present, the Quảng Ninh provincial government has a policy to relocate the\nhouseholds living in the bay to resettle, in order to stabilize their life and\nto protect the landscape of the heritage zone. More than 300 households living\nin fishing villages in Ha Long Bay have been relocated ashore in Khe Cá\nResettlement Area, now known as Zone 8 (Hà Phong Ward, Hạ Long City) since May\n2014. This project will continue to be implemented.

The Ha Long Bay and its adjacent areas consist of a\npart of the Sino-Vietnamese composite terrane having its development history\nfrom pre-Cambrian up to present day. During Phanerozoic, terrigenous,\nvolcanogenic and cherty-carbonate sediments containing in abundance\ngraptolites, brachiopods, fishes, corals, foraminiferas, radiolarias, bivalves\nand flora, separated one from another by 10 stratigraphic gaps, but the\nboundary between Devonian and Carboniferous has been considered as continuous.\nThe limestone karstic geomorphology of the bay was developed since Miocene,\nespecially the cone-shaped hills (fengcong), or isolated high limestone karst\ntowers (fenglin) with many remnants of old phreatic caves, old karstic foot\ncaves, marine notch caves form magnificent limestone karst landforms as unique\non the world. The Quaternary geology was developed through 5 cycles with the\nintercalation of marine and continental environments. The present Ha Long Bay,\nin fact, appeared after the Middle Holocene maximum transgression, leaving\nultimate zone of lateral undercutting in the limestone cliffs bearing many\nshells of oysters, having the 14C age as 2280 to >40,000 y. BP. Geological\nresources are abundant: anthracite, lignite, oil shale, petroleum, phosphate,\nlimestone and cement additives, kaolin, silica sand, dolomite, quartzite of\nexogenous origin, and antimony, mercury of hydrothermal origin. Besides, there\nstill are surface water, groundwater and thermal mineral water on the shore of\nthe Ha Long - Bái Tử Long Bays and other environmental resources.[14][15]\n\nIn terms of marine geology, this area is recorded as an especially coastal\nsedimentary environment. In the alkaline seawater environment, the chemical\ndenudation process of calcium carbonate proceeds rapidly, creating wide,\nstrangely shaped marine notches.\n\nThe bottom surface sediments are various from clay mud to sand, however, silty\nmud and clay mud are dominated in distribution. Especially, the carbonate\nmaterials originated from organisms make up from 60-65% sedimentary content.\nThe surface sediments of coral reefs are mainly sand and pebbles of which the\ncarbonate materials occupy for more than 90%. The intertidal zone sediments\nare various from clay mud to sand and gravel depending to distinguished\nsedimentary environments such as mangrove marshes, tidal flats, beaches etc.\nAt the small, but wonderfully beautiful beaches, the sand sediments may be\ndominated quartz or carbonate materials.\n\nThe sediment layers of intertidal zone, the upper sea bed with a plain surface\nconserving ancient rivers, systems of caves and it's sediments, traces of\nancient marine action forming distinctive notches, beaches and marine\nterraces, mangrove swamps are important evidence of geological events and\nprocesses taking place during Quaternary.[16]\n\n### History of\ntectonics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=H%E1%BA%A1_Long_Bay&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: History of tectonics\")]\n\nHa Long Bay has experienced at least 500 million years in various geological\nstates of [orogeny](/wiki/Orogeny \"Orogeny\"), [marine\ntransgression](/wiki/Sea_level_rise \"Sea level rise\") and [marine\nregression](/wiki/Marine_regression \"Marine regression\"). During the\n[Ordovician](/wiki/Ordovician \"Ordovician\") and [Silurian](/wiki/Silurian\n\"Silurian\") periods (500-410 million years ago), Ha Long Bay was deep sea.\nDuring the [Carboniferous](/wiki/Carboniferous \"Carboniferous\") and\n[Permian](/wiki/Permian \"Permian\") periods (340-250 million years ago), Ha\nLong Bay was at shallow sea level.\n\nThe dominated uplift movement of neotectonic and recent tectonic influenced\ndeeply on topography of this area, and the present landscape of sea-islands\nwas formed around 7 or 8 thousand years ago by the sea invasion during\nHolocene transgression begun at about 17-18 thousand years ago. Particularly\nfrom the Holocene time, from about 11,000 years ago Cat Ba - Ha Long area has\nmuch archaeological evidence connecting variations in sea levels with the\ndevelopment of ancient cultures such as the Soi Nhu and Ha Long cultures.\n\n### Karst geomorphology\nvalue[[edit](/w/index.php?title=H%E1%BA%A1_Long_Bay&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Karst geomorphology value\")]\n\n[![Halong Bay in\nVietnam.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Halong_Bay_in_Vietnam.jpg/220px-\nHalong_Bay_in_Vietnam.jpg)](/wiki/File:Halong_Bay_in_Vietnam.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Halong_Bay_in_Vietnam.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDue to a simultaneous combination of ideal factors such as thick, pale, grey,\nand strong limestone layers, which are formed by fine-grained materials; hot\nand moist climate and slow tectonic process as a whole; Ha Long Bay has had a\ncomplete karst evolution for 20 million years. There are many types of [karst\ntopography](/wiki/Karst_topography \"Karst topography\") in the bay, such as\n[karst field](/wiki/Karst_field \"Karst field\").\n\nHa Long Bay is a mature karst landscape developed during a warm, wet, tropical\nclimate. The sequence of stages in the evolution of a karst landscape over a\nperiod of 20 million years requires a combination of several distinct elements\nincluding a massive thickness of limestone, a hot wet climate and slow overall\ntectonic up lift. The process of karst formation is divided into five stages,\nthe second of which is the formation of the distinctive do line karst. This is\nfollowed by the development of fengcong karst, which can be seen in the groups\nof hills on Bo Hon and Dau Be Inland. These cones with sloping sides average\n100m in height with the tallest exceeding 200m. Fenglin karst is characterised\nby steep separate towers. The hundreds of rocky islands with form the\nbeautiful and famous landscape of the Bay are the individual towers of a\nclassic Fenglin landscape where the intervening plains have been submerged by\nthe sea. Most towers reach a height of between 50 and 100m with a height to\nwidth ratio of about 6. The karst dolines were flooded by the sea, becoming\nthe abundance of lakes that lie within the limestone islands. For example, Dau\nBe island at the mouth of the Bay has six enclosed lakes including those of\nthe Ba Ham lakes lying within its fencong karst. The Bay contains examples of\nthe landscape elements of fengcong, fenglin and karst plain. These are not\nseparate evolutionary stages but the result of natural non – uniform processes\nin the denudation of a large mass of limestone. Marine erosion created the\nnotches which in some places have been enlarged into caves. The marine notch\nis a feature of limestone coastline but, in Ha Long Bay, it has created the\nmature landscape.\n\nWithin Ha Long Bay, the main accessible caves are the older passages that\nsurvive from the time when the karst was evolving though its various stages of\n[fengcong](/w/index.php?title=Fengcong&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fengcong \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") and fenglin. Three main types of caves can be recognized in\nthe limestone islands (Waltham, T. 1998):\n\n  * Remnants of old [phreatic](/wiki/Phreatic \"Phreatic\") caves\n  * Old karstic foot caves\n  * Marine notch caves\n\nThe first group of caves is old phreatic caves which include Sung Sot, Tam\nCung, Lau Dai, Thien Cung, Dau Go, Hoang Long, Thien Long. Nowadays, these\ncaves lie at various high levels. Sung Sot cave is on Bo Hon island. From its\ntruncated entrance chambers on a ledge high on the cliff, a passage of more\nthat 10m high and wide descends to the south. Tam Cung is a large phreatic\nfissure cave that developed in the bedding planes of the limestone dividing\nthe fissure cave into three chambers. Lau Dai is a cave with a complex of\npassages extending over 300m opening on the south side of Con Ngua island.\nThien Cung and Dau Go are remnants of the same old cave system. They both\nsurvive in the northern part of Dau Go island at between 20 and 50m above sea\nlevel. Thien Cung has one large chamber more that 100m long, blocked at its\nends and almost subdivided into smaller chambers by massive wall of\nstalactites and stalagmites. Dau Go is a single large tunnel descending along\na major set of fractures to a massive choke.\n\nThe second group of caves is the old karstic foot caves which include Trinh\nLu, Bo Nau, Tien Ong and Trong caves. Foot caves are a ubiquitous feature of\nkarst landscapes which have reached a stage of widespread lateral undercutting\nat base level. They may extend back into maze caves of stream caves draining\nfrom larger cave systems within the limestone. They are distinguished by the\nmain elements of their passages being close to the horizontal and are commonly\nrelated to denuded or accumulated terraces at the old base levels. Trinh Nu,\nwhich is one of the larger foot caves in Ha Long Bay with its ceiling at about\n12m above sea level and about 80m in length, was developed in multiple stages.\nBo Nau, a horizontal cave containing old stalactite deposits, cuts across the\n25o dip of the bedding plane.\n\nThe third group is the marine notch caves that are a special feature of the\nkarst of Ha Long Bay. The dissolution process of sea water acting on the\nlimestone and erosion by wave action crates notches at the base of the cliffs.\nIn advantageous conditions, dissolution of the limestone allows the cliff\nnotches to be steadily deepened and extended into caves. Many of these at sea\nlevel extend right though the limestone hills into drowned dolines which are\nnow tidal lakes.\n\nA distinguishing feature of marine notch caves is an absolutely smooth and\nhorizontal ceiling cut through the limestone. Some marine notch caves had been\nnot formed at present sea level, but old sea levels related to sea level\nchanges in Holocene transgression, event to Pleistocene sea levels. Some of\nthem passed preserved the development of old karstic foot cave in mainland\nenvironment or preserved the remnants of older phreatic caves. One of the most\nunusual features of Ha Long Bay is the Bo Ham lake group of hidden lakes and\ntheir connecting tunnel – notch caves in Dau Be island. From the island’s\nperimeter cliff a cave, 10m wide at water level and curving so that it is\nalmost completely dark, extends about 150m to Lake 1. Luon cave is on Bo Hon\nisland and extends 50m though to an enclosed tidal lake. It has a massive\nstalactite hanging 2m down and truncated at the modern tidal level. It has\npassed though many stages in its formation.\n\nThe karst landscape of Ha Long Bay is of international significance and of\nfundamental importance to the science of geomorphology. The fenglin tower\nkarst, which is the type present in much of Ha Long Bay, is the most extreme\nform of limestone landscape development. If these karst landscapes are broadly\ncompared in terms of their height, steepness and number of their limestone\ntowers, Ha Long Bay is probably second in the entire world only to Yangshou,\nin China. However, Ha Long Bay has also been invaded by the sea so that the\ngeomorphology of its limestone is lands are, at least in part, the consequence\nof marine erosion. The marine invasion distinguishes Ha Long Bay and makes it\nunique in the world. There are other areas of submerged karst towers which\nwere invaded by the sea, but none is as extensive as Ha Long Bay. [15] [17]\n\n### Timeline of geologic\nevolution[[edit](/w/index.php?title=H%E1%BA%A1_Long_Bay&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Timeline of geologic evolution\")]\n\nSome of the most remarkable geological events in Ha Long Bay's history have\noccurred in the last 1,000 years, include the advance of the sea, the raising\nof the bay area, strong erosion that has formed coral, and, pure blue and\nheavily salted water. This process of erosion by seawater has deeply engraved\nthe stone, contributing to its fantastic beauty. Present-day Ha Long Bay is\nthe result of this long process of geological evolution that has been\ninfluenced by so many factors.\n\nDue to all these factors, tourists visiting Ha Long Bay are not only treated\nto one of the natural wonders of the world, but also to a precious geological\nmuseum that has been naturally preserved in the open air for the last 300\nmillion years.\n\nDate | [Geologic period](/wiki/Geologic_period \"Geologic period\") | Events  \n---|---|---  \n570,000,000-500,000,000 BC | beginning of the [Cambrian](/wiki/Cambrian \"Cambrian\") Period | The area, which now forms Ha Long Bay, was basically mainland, submitted to a process of rain erosion.  \n| end of the Cambrian Period | The area was flooded, commencing the existence of Ha Long Bay.  \n500,000,000-400,000,000 BC | [Ordovician](/wiki/Ordovician \"Ordovician\") and [Silurian](/wiki/Silurian \"Silurian\") periods | The area of north-east Vietnam was almost like a deep sea, submitted to the constant activity of tectonic plates.  \n| end of the Silurian Period | It underwent a phase of inverse-motion that created mountains deep under the water.  \n420,000,000-340,000,000 BC | end of the Silurian Period and throughout the whole [Devonian](/wiki/Devonian \"Devonian\") Period | The area was subjected to powerful forces of erosion from the hot and dry climate. At this point, Ha Long was part of a wide mainland that comprised most of today's South China Sea and Chinese continental shelf.  \n| end of the Devonian Period | Due to tectonic activity, the Ha Long area and the entire north-east region were raised from the depths  \n340,000,000-240,000,000 BC | later [Carboniferous](/wiki/Carboniferous \"Carboniferous\") and [Permian](/wiki/Permian \"Permian\") periods | The formation of the limestone layer more than 1,000 m thick. A shallow and warm sea reformed, which existed for approximately 100 million years. It created two kinds of limestone: the Cát Bà layer of the early Carboniferous period (450 m thick); and the Quang Hanh layer of the middle Carboniferous and the early Permian period (750 m thick). These two layers constitute the majority of the islands of the Bay.  \n67,000,000 BC | end of the [Cretaceous](/wiki/Cretaceous \"Cretaceous\") Period | Ha Long Bay existed in the environment of a high mountainous mainland due to the influence of strong mountain-forming phases.  \n| middle of the [Paleogene](/wiki/Paleogene \"Paleogene\") Period | These motions remain continuous and stable, while strong processes of erosion began, and after millions of years, a form of semi-highland topography took shape. The continuation of this erosion has progressively cut the highlands into blocks with altitudes similar to today's mountains  \n26,000,000-10,000,000 BC | [Neogene](/wiki/Neogene \"Neogene\") Period | The development of the Ha Long depression  \n2,000,000-9000 BC | [Pleistocene](/wiki/Pleistocene \"Pleistocene\") epoch of the [Quaternary](/wiki/Quaternary \"Quaternary\") period | The process of erosion began dissolving the limestone-rich region of Ha Long, after that, forming the limestone plain was most active  \n68,000-9000 BC | middle and late [Pleistocene](/wiki/Pleistocene \"Pleistocene\") Epoch | Period when the caves and grottoes of the area formed.  \n| early [Holocene](/wiki/Holocene \"Holocene\") Epoch | The islands of today's Ha Long Bay are basically remnants of these mountains, flooded. Rainwater flowed into crevices in the limestone that had formed from tectonic activity. This steady erosion constantly widened the cracks, eventually creating today's formations.  \n9000-5000 BC | Holocene Epoch | This period is notable for the advance of the sea.  \n5000-2000 BC |  | The movement of the sea reached its peak and forming today's Ha Long Bay.  \n2000–1000 BC |  | With the sea in a steady process of recession, Ha Long culture began to develop.  \n| beginning of the late Holocene Epoch | The level of the water once again increased, forming a marshy floor of canals and streams, and creating the water marks that can be seen on the stone cliffs of today.  \n  \n##\nEcology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=H%E1%BA%A1_Long_Bay&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Ecology\")]\n\nHa Long Bay is host to two ecosystems: a tropical, moist, evergreen rainforest\necosystem; and a marine and coastal ecosystem.

In 2000 the\n[World Heritage Committee](/wiki/World_Heritage_Committee \"World Heritage\nCommittee\") additionally recognised Ha Long Bay for its outstanding geological\nand geomorphological value,[12] and its World Heritage Listing was\nupdated.[20]\n\nIn October 2011, [World Monuments Fund](/wiki/World_Monuments_Fund \"World\nMonuments Fund\") included the bay on the [2012 World Monuments\nWatch](/wiki/2012_World_Monuments_Watch \"2012 World Monuments Watch\"), citing\ntourism pressures and associated development as threats to the site that must\nbe addressed. The goal of Watch-listing is to promote strategies of\nresponsible heritage-driven development for a sustainable future.\n\nIn 2012, New 7 Wonders Foundation officially named Ha Long Bay as one of [New\nSeven Natural Wonders](/wiki/New7Wonders_of_Nature \"New7Wonders of Nature\") of\nthe world.\n\nHa Long Bay is also a member of the Club of the Most Beautiful Bays of the\nWorld.[21]\n\n## In\nliterature[[edit](/w/index.php?title=H%E1%BA%A1_Long_Bay&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: In literature\")]\n\nIn writings about Ha Long Bay, the following Vietnamese writers said:\n\n  * [Nguyễn Trãi](/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_Tr%C3%A3i \"Nguyễn Trãi\"): \"This wonder is ground raising up into the middle of the high sky\".\n  * [Xuân Diệu](/wiki/Xu%C3%A2n_Di%E1%BB%87u \"Xuân Diệu\"): \"Here is the unfinished works of the Beings...Here is the stones which the Giant played and threw away\".\n  * [Nguyên Ngọc](/w/index.php?title=Nguy%C3%AAn_Ng%E1%BB%8Dc&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Nguyên Ngọc \\(page does not exist\\)\"): \"...to form this first- rate wonder, nature only uses: Stone and Water...There are just only two materials themselves chosen from as much as materials, in order to write, to draw, to sculpture, to create everything...It is quite possible that here is the image of the future world\".\n  * [Ho Chi Minh](/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh \"Ho Chi Minh\"): \"It is the wonder that one cannot impart to others\".\n  * [Phạm Văn Đồng](/wiki/Ph%E1%BA%A1m_V%C4%83n_%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng \"Phạm Văn Đồng\"): \"Is it one scenery or many sceneries?
