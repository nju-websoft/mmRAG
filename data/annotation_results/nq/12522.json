She is the primary\nfemale character in the series, befriending her across-the-hall neighbors\n[Leonard Hofstadter](/wiki/Leonard_Hofstadter \"Leonard Hofstadter\") ([Johnny\nGalecki](/wiki/Johnny_Galecki \"Johnny Galecki\")) and [Sheldon\nCooper](/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper \"Sheldon Cooper\") ([Jim\nParsons](/wiki/Jim_Parsons \"Jim Parsons\")), two physicists who work at the\nnearby [California Institute of\nTechnology](/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology \"California Institute of\nTechnology\") (Caltech). Penny's lack of advanced education, but outgoing\npersonality and common sense drastically contrast with the personalities of\nthe primary male characters in the series, even though she is considered part\nof their group. She is the love interest of Leonard, with whom she maintains a\nbrief romantic relationship during the third season, which is later resumed in\nthe fifth season and culminates in an engagement at the end of the seventh\nseason and a wedding at the start of season 9.[1] Penny is the only main\ncharacter of the show whose last name has not been revealed,[2] although she\nhas been occasionally referred to or addressed with the last name Hofstadter\nsince her wedding.[3][4]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Personality\n    * 1.1 Interaction with Sheldon\n    * 1.2 Nerd traits\n  * 2 Financial issues\n  * 3 Family\n  * 4 Work\n  * 5 Relationships\n  * 6 Development\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n\n##\nPersonality[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Personality\")]\n\nOriginally from a small town outside of [Omaha,\nNebraska](/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska \"Omaha, Nebraska\"), Penny has aspirations of\nbecoming an actress. Until season 7, she worked as a waitress at the local\n[Cheesecake Factory](/wiki/Cheesecake_Factory \"Cheesecake Factory\").[5][6] She\nis a [Sagittarius](/wiki/Sagittarius_\\(astrology\\) \"Sagittarius\n\\(astrology\\)\"), born on December 2.[7] She has full confidence in\n[horoscopes](/wiki/Horoscope \"Horoscope\") and [psychics](/wiki/Psychic\n\"Psychic\"), which has led to arguments with Sheldon and Leonard about their\naccuracy.[6][7]\n\nIn contrast to the rest of the group, Penny is not well educated nor savvy in\na specific technical field, but she has great [social\nskills](/wiki/Social_skills \"Social skills\") and is more streetwise than her\nneighbors. She is very knowledgeable about popular culture.[8] She is messy\nand disorganized but appears to like it that way.[9] Having dropped out of\n[community college](/wiki/Community_college \"Community college\") prior to the\nstart of the series, she is the only regular character with less education\nthan [Howard Wolowitz](/wiki/Howard_Wolowitz \"Howard Wolowitz\"), who has a\nmaster's degree. She initially feels insulted when Leonard shows her a list of\ncommunity colleges to go to at the beginning of season 2, but in season 6, she\ndoes go back to college, taking a history class. By the middle of the season,\nshe is also taking an acting class, and at the beginning of season 7, she is\ntaking a psychology class as well. Despite her weak education, she is\ninsightful. While Sheldon routinely disparages both Penny's and Howard's\neducations, he occasionally acknowledges her intelligence and potential,\nthough he rarely treats Howard so. He has also asked for her advice more than\nonce regarding various social situations.\n\nLeonard has likened her to [The Hulk](/wiki/Hulk_\\(comics\\) \"Hulk \\(comics\\)\")\nwhen she gets angry,[10] while Sheldon once said to recurring character\n[Stuart\nBloom](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Recurring_characters \"List\nof The Big Bang Theory characters\") that she would \"maul [him] like a rabid\n[wolverine](/wiki/Wolverine \"Wolverine\")\" if Stuart woke her up from a sound\nsleep.[11]\n\nA recurring theme is Penny's poor driving. She fails to service her vehicle\nregularly, and ignores her [check engine light](/wiki/Check_engine_light\n\"Check engine light\"), which has been mentioned in multiple episodes.[12][13]\nShe once left her car's passenger side [wing mirror](/wiki/Wing_mirror \"Wing\nmirror\") in a parking lot.[14] She once hit a Mercedes in a parking lot and\nleft without leaving a note.[15] She also inadvertently reveals that she\nknocked the mirror off Bernadette's car and did not leave a note.[16] When her\ncar's engine finally fails in Season 7, Leonard buys her a new one so she can\ngo to auditions and pursue her dream of becoming an actress. In Season 8,\nafter finding a job as a highly paid pharmaceutical sales representative at\nBernadette's company, she obtains a company car and sells the one Leonard\nbought for her, returning him the money.[17]\n\nIn the fifth-season episode \"The Speckerman Recurrence\", it is revealed that\nPenny was a bully during her time at school. However, she seems to be\ngenuinely unaware of the hurt her actions caused, and upon her realization,\nshe attempts to make amends with a classmate she tormented, with little\nsuccess.[18]\n\nA recurring personality trait is her consumption of alcohol, specifically\nwine. In \"[The Flaming Spittoon\nAcquisition](/wiki/The_Flaming_Spittoon_Acquisition \"The Flaming Spittoon\nAcquisition\")\", Penny, while spending the evening with Bernadette and Amy,\nobserves that they have finished the bottle of wine, and when Bernadette and\nAmy point out that they consumed only half a glass and no wine at all,\nrespectively, Penny snaps, \"Okay, don't judge me! So, what do you want to do,\ngo to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?\" At the end of that\nepisode, she passes out while the three of them play\n[Twister](/wiki/Twister_\\(game\\) \"Twister \\(game\\)\"), and when Bernadette\ninitially fails to revive her, she says \"Penny, we're out of wine\", which\nmanages to wake Penny. In \"[The Intimacy\nAcceleration](/w/index.php?title=The_Intimacy_Acceleration&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"The Intimacy Acceleration \\(page does not exist\\)\")\", Sheldon asks her, \"If\nyou could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what\nwould it be?\" Penny replied, “Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning\nwater into wine sounds pretty good.”. In \"[The Locomotive\nManipulation](/wiki/The_Locomotive_Manipulation \"The Locomotive\nManipulation\")\", Leonard declines Amy's suggestion that the group spend a\nweekend in [Napa Valley](/wiki/Napa_Valley \"Napa Valley\"), leading to this\nexchange:\n\n    Leonard: \"I'm not sure it's a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. (Looks at Penny) What? It's a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it's all for laughs.\"\n\n    Penny: \"That would really piss me off if I didn't have a buzz going on.\"\n\n### Interaction with\nSheldon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Interaction with Sheldon\")]\n\nA staple of the series' humor is Penny's awkward interactions with Sheldon,\nwhich are fueled by the fact that they are almost polar opposites in terms of\nintellect and social aptitude.\n\nIn one episode, Sheldon tries to \"improve\" Penny, rewarding her with chocolate\nfor what he considers \"correct behavior\", as in [operant\nconditioning](/wiki/Operant_conditioning \"Operant conditioning\") of lab rats.\nLeonard noticed it and accused Sheldon of modifying her like [Pavlov's\ndogs](/wiki/Classical_conditioning \"Classical conditioning\").[19] Although the\ntwo characters sometimes clash, and Penny is frequently irritated by Sheldon's\nobstinacy and lack of social awareness, she has developed an affection for\nhim. She and Leonard occasionally behave as if Sheldon were their child (once\nalluded to in season 11's \"The Collaboration Contamination\" when Penny\nactually uses a parenting book of Bernadette's on Sheldon), and Penny is very\npleased whenever Sheldon acts tenderly towards her. Penny often calls Sheldon\n\"sweetie\", a term of endearment she frequently uses with other characters (a\nfact that Sheldon has himself pointed out), and Penny and Amy are the only\nprincipal characters who ever openly demonstrate their genuine fondness for\nSheldon.\n\nEvidence of Penny's affection for Sheldon is apparent in various episodes.\nPenny takes care of Sheldon while he is ill[20] and lets him stay at her\napartment when he is locked out of his, or if he has a bad dream or is feeling\nunsafe;[21] Sheldon lent her money when she needed it[22] and takes care of\nher when she [dislocates her shoulder](/wiki/Dislocated_shoulder \"Dislocated\nshoulder\").[14] Despite not being as well versed as the men in geek culture,\nPenny has shown attention to what each of her friends likes, although she\nstill remains dismissive of them: during a Christmas episode, Penny gives\nSheldon a signed napkin autographed by [Leonard Nimoy](/wiki/Leonard_Nimoy\n\"Leonard Nimoy\"). In return, Sheldon gives Penny several baskets of bath\nproducts and then a long hug, to both her and Leonard's surprise. When\nSheldon's _[World of Warcraft](/wiki/World_of_Warcraft \"World of Warcraft\")_\naccount is [hacked](/wiki/Hacker_\\(computer_security\\) \"Hacker \\(computer\nsecurity\\)\") and the four men all back down from the much larger hacker who\nalso steals Sheldon's [Klingon](/wiki/Klingon \"Klingon\")\n[Bat'leth](/wiki/Bat%27leth \"Bat'leth\"), Penny kicks the hacker in the groin.\nFollowing her breakup with Leonard, Penny takes Sheldon along when she and\nsome friends from work went to [Disneyland](/wiki/Disneyland \"Disneyland\"),\nfor which he is thankful. In the same episode, \"The Spaghetti Catalyst\", she\nnotes that she takes Sheldon shopping for his linens. (This episode also shows\nher and Leonard acting like a divorced couple and Sheldon is their \"son\", a\ndynamic that recurs in successive seasons). She has also helped Sheldon\nresolve conflicts with Amy, as in \"The Shiny Trinket Maneuver\".\n\nIn \"The Panty Pinata Polarization\" Penny has a fight with Sheldon as he\nbanishes her from his apartment and using their Wi-Fi as she got \"three\nstrikes\". She defends herself by refusing to take down his order at the\nrestaurant and then ruins his weekly Saturday laundry night but then he puts\nPenny's underwear on the telephone wire. After having a heated argument with\nhis mother, Sheldon apologises to Penny and then they make amends with one\nanother.\n\nSheldon has also acknowledged that he likes Penny, although he claims this was\nonly because he was forced to because Leonard \"made him\", and that Sheldon\nliking her was a \"hard row to hoe\",[23] although in \"The Intimacy\nAcceleration\" Sheldon has admitted that he considers Penny a sisterly or\nmotherly figure.\n\n### Nerd\ntraits[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Nerd traits\")]\n\nA number of episodes depict Penny's assimilation of [nerd\nculture](/wiki/Nerd_culture \"Nerd culture\") through her relationship with the\nmen, and has developed to quote some science fiction shows (like _[Star\nTrek](/wiki/Star_Trek \"Star Trek\")_), and movies (_[Star Wars](/wiki/Star_Wars\n\"Star Wars\")_). After Sheldon introduces her to the online role-playing game\n_[Age of Conan](/wiki/Age_of_Conan \"Age of Conan\")_ , Penny becomes\n[addicted](/wiki/Video_game_addiction \"Video game addiction\"), to the point of\nignoring her friends, her hygiene, her general appearance and her job, and\npesters Sheldon incessantly for gaming advice. She finally overcomes her\naddiction when she realizes she has agreed to go on a [virtual\ndate](/wiki/Virtual_dating \"Virtual dating\") within the game with Howard.[24]\n\nIn episodes such as \"The Apology Insufficiency\", \"The Dead Hooker\nJuxtaposition\", \"The Wheaton Recurrence\" and \"The Love Car Displacement\", she\nmakes casual references to _Star Trek_.[25] In \"The Bakersfield Expedition\",\nPenny, Amy and Bernadette read some of the men's comics, believing there is\nnothing interesting in them, only to get into a huge heated argument about\nwhether or not only [Thor](/wiki/Thor_\\(Marvel_Comics\\) \"Thor \\(Marvel\nComics\\)\") could wield his enchanted hammer [Mjolnir](/wiki/Mjolnir_\\(comics\\)\n\"Mjolnir \\(comics\\)\").[26] In season 7's \"The Proton Transmogrification\", she\nalarms herself when she realizes that she understands Raj and Howard's corny\n_Star Wars_ -related puns.\n\nPenny sometimes references science and technology-related ideas. In \"[The\nCodpiece Topology](/wiki/The_Codpiece_Topology \"The Codpiece Topology\")\",\nPenny, having previously learned of [Schrödinger's\ncat](/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat \"Schrödinger's cat\") in \"The Tangerine\nFactor\", is seen explaining that concept to her date. In \"The Beta Test\nInitiation\", Penny references [beta testing](/wiki/Beta_test \"Beta test\") when\nLeonard uses a software development analogy, to describe their attempt to\nstart a romantic relationship again, although he points out he was technically\ntalking about [alpha testing](/wiki/Alpha_test \"Alpha test\"). In \"The Veracity\nElasticity\" she demonstrates fluency in _[Ubbi Dubbi](/wiki/Ubbi_Dubbi \"Ubbi\nDubbi\")_ by having a secret conversation with [Amy Farrah\nFowler](/wiki/Amy_Farrah_Fowler \"Amy Farrah Fowler\") in front of Sheldon and\nLeonard, when the guys are having their own secret conversation in Klingon.\n\n## Financial\nissues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Financial issues\")]\n\nA recurring theme throughout the series is Penny's ongoing financial problems.\nThis is seen in \"The Financial Permeability\", when she finds herself behind on\nher bills, and borrows money from Sheldon, only to later become paranoid that\nhe is pestering her for repayment, even though he makes no such indications of\nthis - he misinterprets Penny's paranoia and even offers her more money, while\nLeonard points out that one of the few things about Sheldon that isn't\ninsufferable is that he genuinely doesn't care about how long it will take to\nrepay the money. More subtle references are seen in the fact that she once\nattempted to pay for her electric bill using a [Starbucks](/wiki/Starbucks\n\"Starbucks\") gift card, an apology note and pictures of her in underwear.[27]\n\nA subset of this trait is addressed by other characters is her freeloading. In\nthe second-season episode \"The Financial Permeability\", when Penny is short on\nmoney, Leonard pays for her share of a group dinner, which causes Raj and\nHoward to joke that they would get free food too if they wore skintight jeans\nand a tank top. A recurring gag in the fourth season is Sheldon's frequent\nchange of his and Leonard's [Wi-Fi](/wiki/Wi-Fi \"Wi-Fi\") password to address\nPenny's use of their signal. In \"The Thespian Catalyst\", he changes the\npassword to \"Penny is a freeloader\",[28] in \"[The Roommate\nTransmogrification](/wiki/The_Roommate_Transmogrification \"The Roommate\nTransmogrification\")\" he has changed it to \"Penny, get your own Wi-Fi\",[29]\nand in the episode \"The Speckerman Recurrence\", he has changed it into \"Penny\nalready eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi\". In the seventh season \"[The\nConvention Conundrum](/wiki/The_Convention_Conundrum \"The Convention\nConundrum\")\", when the women go out for drinks, and ponder their own maturity,\nand Penny questions the significance of that trait, Bernadette replies that it\nwould mean that their check would be split three ways.[16]\n\nPenny's financial situation takes a turn at the start of season eight, when\nshe lands a job in \"[The Locomotion\nInterruption](/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_\\(season_8\\)#ep160 \"The Big Bang\nTheory \\(season 8\\)\")\" as a sales representative at the pharmaceutical company\nat which Bernadette works. By \"[The Expedition\nApproximation](/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_\\(season_8\\)#ep165 \"The Big Bang\nTheory \\(season 8\\)\")\", she is making enough money to be financially self-\nsufficient, able to sell the automobile Leonard previously gave her (\"[The\nFriendship Turbulence](/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_\\(season_7\\)#ep152 \"The Big\nBang Theory \\(season 7\\)\")\") and gives him back the money for it—changing\ntheir dynamic and leading to discussions on whether her future financial\nwindfalls may prove difficult for him, given his insecurities. This situation\nwas later exacerbated when it was revealed that Penny now actually earns\nsignificantly more than Leonard.\n\nIn the season nine episode \"[The Big Bear\nPrecipitation](/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_\\(season_9\\)#ep203 \"The Big Bang\nTheory \\(season 9\\)\")\", Penny reveals she hates her job as a representative\nbut sticks with it because she still has large debts and also does not want to\ngo back to waitressing or acting.\n\n##\nFamily[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Family\")]\n\nIn \"The Maternal Capacitance\", Penny reveals that her father Wyatt ([Keith\nCarradine](/wiki/Keith_Carradine \"Keith Carradine\"))[30] tried to raise her\nlike a boy, which is a source of pain for her, leading her to have father\nissues. When she and Leonard begin dating, Wyatt comes to appreciate that she\nis dating an accomplished academic, rather than an uneducated hick, so much so\nthat when he visits Penny in the fourth-season episode \"[The Boyfriend\nComplexity](/wiki/The_Boyfriend_Complexity \"The Boyfriend Complexity\")\"\nfollowing her and Leonard's breakup, it is revealed that she has not revealed\nthe breakup to her father. When she later informs Wyatt of the breakup, Wyatt\nsecretly encourages Leonard to not give up on her. In contrast to all other\ncharacters, Penny and her father's last name have not been revealed. Co-\ncreator [Bill Prady](/wiki/Bill_Prady \"Bill Prady\") stated that Penny's last\nname will be revealed eventually.[31] Executive producer Steve Molaro,\nhowever, has since stated her last name will remain a secret.[32]\n\nIn an early episode, Penny talked to [Raj](/wiki/Raj_Koothrappali \"Raj\nKoothrappali\") about her sister having shot her brother-in-law.[9] In another\nepisode, Penny accompanied the men to the comic book store to shop for a gift\nfor her 13-year-old nephew.[11] In \"The Boyfriend Complexity\" (4–9), Wyatt\n(Penny's father) tells Leonard he wants grandchildren one day, \"and I want\nthem to grow up on a house without wheels\".[30] In \"The Dumpling Paradox\",\nPenny has an unwanted guest, Christy, staying with her who had slept with her\nbrother while being engaged to her cousin, saying, \"she's _kind_ of family\".\nChristy knows Penny from back in Omaha and, according to Penny, she slept with\nnearly every man in the city, earning her the nickname \"Whore of Omaha\". While\nstaying with Penny, Christy sleeps with Howard.[33]\n\nIn the Season 5 episode \"The Pulled Groin Extrapolation\", after Penny quickly\ngrabs and eats the last dumpling of a group dinner after a brief disagreement\nover who should get it, Sheldon makes the sarcastic comment, \"I've seen\npictures of your mother. Keep eating\", a reference to Penny's mother's weight,\nthat clearly unsettles her. In \"[The Flaming Spittoon\nAcquisition](/wiki/The_Flaming_Spittoon_Acquisition \"The Flaming Spittoon\nAcquisition\")\", Penny confesses to Bernadette that her mother [smoked\npot](/wiki/Smoked_pot \"Smoked pot\") while she was pregnant with her.\n\nPenny has mentioned having a sister who appears to be the mother of her\n13-year-old nephew mentioned in Season 2. In \"The Bachelor Party Corrosion\",\nPenny tells Bernadette, Amy and viewers that at her sister's wedding she was\nheavily pregnant since she and their father started a father-daughter dance\nand then her water broke.\n\nPenny has mentioned having a brother on [parole](/wiki/Parole \"Parole\"), who\nshe says is \"_kind_ of a chemist\". In \"The Rhinitis Revelation\" (5–6), she is\nmore explicit in revealing that he is in the practice of cooking [crystal\nmeth](/wiki/Methamphetamine \"Methamphetamine\").[34] She mentions that he is\nback in prison for 12–18 months, depending on his behavior, in the seventh-\nseason finale, \"The Status Quo Combustion\".\n\nPenny's mother Susan, who Penny has occasionally spoken with on the phone in\nprior episodes (usually about other family members), finally appears in the\nSeason 10 premiere episode \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", portrayed by [Katey\nSagal](/wiki/Katey_Sagal \"Katey Sagal\"). She is shown to be very embarrassed\nby her family's shortcomings: her son's criminal record and jailing, Wyatt's\ndrinking, and their overall humble existence as a farming family. Although she\nhas previously met Leonard and likes him, she is uncomfortable about meeting\nhis academic parents, not wanting them to think of her family as \"white\ntrash\". She goes to great lengths to present them in the best possible light,\nincluding buying dental implants for her son.\n\n##\nWork[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Work\")]\n\nUntil the seventh season, Penny's main job was as a waitress at her local [The\nCheesecake Factory](/wiki/The_Cheesecake_Factory \"The Cheesecake Factory\"),\nalthough in the first-season episode \"[The Grasshopper\nExperiment](/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_\\(season_1\\)#ep8 \"The Big Bang Theory\n\\(season 1\\)\")\" she trained as a [bartender](/wiki/Bartender \"Bartender\"). It\nseemed that she occasionally picked up the bartending shift in the restaurant.\nIn 2010, when actress Kaley Cuoco broke her leg, Penny was shown working as a\nbartender in [several season 4\nepisodes](/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory_\\(season_4\\)#Kaley_Cuoco's_broken_leg \"The\nBig Bang Theory \\(season 4\\)\") to hide the cast on her leg.\n\nHer work at The Cheesecake Factory, was initially meant to be a temporary job\nfor her desired profession as an actress, although her expectations are\nsomewhat high and naive at the beginning. She admits in season two that her\nplan was to be a waitress for six months and then become a movie star, and her\nback-up plan was to become a TV star. She regularly goes to castings, but\noften ends up unsuccessful, or finding the role being auditioned to be quite\ndifferent from what she expected, as was the case when she thought she was\nauditioning for a cat food commercial and it instead turned out to be a\ncasting for a [pornographic film](/wiki/Pornographic_film \"Pornographic\nfilm\"). In the season one episode \"The Loobenfeld Decay\", she is cast in a\nproduction of _[Rent](/wiki/Rent_\\(musical\\) \"Rent \\(musical\\)\")_ , and in\n\"The Terminator Decoupling\" she refers to another of her roles as \"[Anne\nFrank](/wiki/Anne_Frank \"Anne Frank\") in a theater above a bowling alley\".\nFrustrated with her acting career, in the season five premiere, she briefly\nconsiders returning to Nebraska until landing a part in a commercial for\n[hemorrhoid](/wiki/Hemorrhoid \"Hemorrhoid\") cream. In \"The Monster Isolation\",\nPenny is seen performing the role of [Blanche DuBois](/wiki/Blanche_DuBois\n\"Blanche DuBois\") in her acting class' production of [A Streetcar Named\nDesire](/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_\\(play\\) \"A Streetcar Named Desire\n\\(play\\)\"). In this episode Sheldon, who attended the show along with Leonard\nand Amy, is impressed with Penny's ability to memorize lines, but still\ncouldn't remember customers' orders as a waitress. In the season seven\npremiere, she was revealed to have had a topless shower scene in a low budget\nhorror film named \"Serial Apeist\" when she first moved to California, which\nshe did not realise had been [uploaded](/wiki/Uploaded \"Uploaded\") to the\ninternet until Sheldon revealed it was available online and the gang saw it on\nthe day they met her.\n\nIn the season seven episode \"The Hesitation Ramification\", Penny believes she\nhas finally found stardom when she lands a brief role in\n_[NCIS](/wiki/NCIS_\\(TV_series\\) \"NCIS \\(TV series\\)\")_. She is devastated\nwhen her scene is cut, but later decides it is time to focus solely on acting;\nshe quits her job at The Cheesecake Factory to devote herself to become an\nactress.\n\nDespite usually going to her neighbors for technical assistance when she has\nproblems with her computer, Penny does have some mechanical skills of her own.\nWhen she was a child, she rebuilt a tractor engine on the farm where she grew\nup[9] and competed in a junior rodeo.[35]\n\nDuring season eight, Penny gives up her acting career and gets a job as a\nsalesperson at Bernadette's [pharmaceutical](/wiki/Pharmaceutical\n\"Pharmaceutical\") company. The next season has Penny admitting that she hates\nher job flirting with her customers for sales.\n\n##\nRelationships[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Relationships\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Kaley_Cuoco_and_Johnny_Galecki_at_PaleyFest_2013.jpg/220px-\nKaley_Cuoco_and_Johnny_Galecki_at_PaleyFest_2013.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kaley_Cuoco_and_Johnny_Galecki_at_PaleyFest_2013.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kaley_Cuoco_and_Johnny_Galecki_at_PaleyFest_2013.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nKaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki (who portrays Leonard) at\n[PaleyFest](/wiki/PaleyFest \"PaleyFest\")\n\nUnlike the rest of the main characters, Penny is very outgoing and assertive,\nand has many romantic relationships over the course of the series. She often\ndates, and in one way or another all the men have gone to her for dating\nadvice. In the fourth season opener, Sheldon estimates that Penny has dated\n193 men, and had sex with 31 of them. Penny strenuously denies it was ever\nthat many. Amy asks Penny in the same conversation if, in light of her sex\npartners, she considers herself a \"[slut](/wiki/Slut \"Slut\")\", Penny responds\nuncertainly, \"No. No. ... No?\"[12]\n\nIn the series premiere, Penny moves in across the hall from Leonard and\nSheldon because of her recent split from her boyfriend,\n[Kurt](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Kurt \"List of The Big Bang\nTheory characters\"), after living together for four years. She says she still\nloves him, even though he cheated on her.[6] Kurt makes two more appearances\nin the series.[22][36]\n\nFrom the beginning,[6] Leonard's infatuation with Penny becomes a major force\nthat drives the series. Howard also shows interest in her (primarily\n[sexual](/wiki/Libido \"Libido\")), but he is always rejected abruptly due to\nhis unsettling approaches. Although Penny occasionally teases Raj for his\ninability to speak to her, she is sympathetic and kind towards him, and as\nwith Sheldon, she almost always overlooks his idiosyncrasies and appreciates\nthat his intentions are good.\n\nIn the first-season episode \"The Fuzzy Boots Corollary\", Penny describes her\napproach after a failed relationship: she picks up an attractive man to have\nrebound sex with over the course of a 36-hour weekend, then leaves him.[37]\n\nIn the first-season finale, Penny breaks up with her boyfriend after he posts\nintimate details about their private life on his blog. This gives Leonard the\nopportunity to ask her out on a first official date.[38] Although the date is\nsuccessful, Penny becomes worried after she lies to Leonard about graduating\nfrom [community college](/wiki/Community_colleges_in_the_United_States\n\"Community colleges in the United States\") (it is mentioned in a later\nepisode, \"The Cohabitation Formulation\", that she was enrolled in one, but\ndropped out). When Sheldon asks her why she lied, she indicates that she is\nself-conscious about her comparative level of education. Leonard eventually\nlearns the truth, but makes matters worse when he tries to encourage Penny to\nenroll in [Pasadena City College](/wiki/Pasadena_City_College \"Pasadena City\nCollege\"), as Penny interprets his suggestion as an insult to her\nintelligence, and rebuffs him.[39]\n\nIn \"The Maternal Capacitance\", Penny's introduction to Leonard's mother, Dr.\nBeverly Hofstadter, causes Penny and Leonard to seek comfort in each other.\nThey nearly have sex, but when Leonard comments in bed that she was attracted\nto him because of a psychological need to be closer to her father, her\nrevulsion at this causes her to rebuff him.[40]\n\nAfterwards, Penny dates\n[Stuart](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Stuart \"List of The Big\nBang Theory characters\"), from the comic book store, but their dates do not\nlead to a relationship. The first time, Penny and Stuart are interrupted by\nSheldon, who argues at length with Stuart over whether [Dick\nGrayson](/wiki/Nightwing \"Nightwing\") or [Jason Todd](/wiki/Jason_Todd \"Jason\nTodd\") should be Batman's successor, while Penny falls to sleep.[11] Their\ndating ends in \"The Classified Materials Turbulence\", when Penny and Stuart\nare kissing, and Penny mistakenly calls him \"Leonard\".[41]\n\nIn the second-season finale Penny finally shows strong romantic feelings for\nLeonard. When she discovers that Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, and Raj will be\nspending three months at the [magnetic North Pole](/wiki/Magnetic_North_Pole\n\"Magnetic North Pole\") for a scientific experiment, she becomes sad and gives\nLeonard a [Snuggie](/wiki/Sleeved_blanket \"Sleeved blanket\") and a long hug,\nthat Leonard perceives as unusually long. Although Penny dismisses the meaning\ninto which Leonard reads the gift and the hug, she later admits to herself\nthat it meant that she did not want him to leave.[42]\n\nIn the third-season premiere, after the men returned from the expedition,\nPenny kisses Leonard immediately upon his return, having missed him\nimmensely.[43] Initially, Leonard and Penny feel uncomfortable with their new\nrelationship, and they agreed to remain only friends, but are unable to\nmaintain this resolution and began a stable relationship.[44] Their\nrelationship sours, however, when Leonard tells Penny he loves her for the\nfirst time, and an unsure Penny simply replied, \"Thank you.\" The resulting\ntension eventually led to Penny breaking up with Leonard during a bowling\nmatch.[45] However, they remain friends and even sleep together once after\nbreaking up after Penny gets drunk following a bad date with [Zack\nJohnson](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Zack \"List of The Big\nBang Theory characters\"), after she realizes Leonard ruined her ability to\ntolerate and date unintelligent men.[46]\n\nIn the fourth season, Penny reveals to her friends [Bernadette\nRostenkowski](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Bernadette \"List of\nThe Big Bang Theory characters\") and [Amy Farrah\nFowler](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Amy_Farrah_Fowler \"List\nof The Big Bang Theory characters\") during a \"[Truth or\nDare?](/wiki/Truth_or_Dare%3F \"Truth or Dare?\")\" game that she has still not\nmoved on from Leonard. This is further implied in \"The Justice League\nRecombination\" when she indicates to Leonard that her reunion with Zack, and\nZack's decision to have the two of them join the men in dressing up as the\n[Justice League](/wiki/Justice_League \"Justice League\") for New Year's Eve\ncostume party at Stuart's comic shop is made difficult by her history with\nLeonard. In \"The Love Car Displacement\", Penny and the rest of the cast attend\nan academic conference in [Big Sur](/wiki/Big_Sur,_California \"Big Sur,\nCalifornia\"). She and Leonard share the same hotel room for the night and they\nalmost have sex until Raj walks in on them. The next day, bored with the\nconference, Penny accepts a ride back to Los Angeles from [Professor\nGlenn](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Minor_characters \"List of\nThe Big Bang Theory characters\"), Bernadette's tall and attractive ex-\nboyfriend. When Raj's sister,\n[Priya](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Recurring_characters\n\"List of The Big Bang Theory characters\"), returns in the episode \"The\nCohabitation Formulation\", Priya and Leonard begin a romantic relationship.\nPenny appears to be initially accepting of their relationship, but is later\ndiscovered by Amy to be heartbroken over it.\n\nIn the Season four finale, Penny reveals to Raj that she regrets breaking up\nwith Leonard. However, even though she and Raj both agree to be friends, they\nget drunk and wake up in bed together, apparently both naked, the next\nmorning. Leonard, Sheldon, and Howard discover Penny [leaving the\napartment](/wiki/Walk_of_shame \"Walk of shame\"), deducing that they just had\nsex. In the Season 5 premiere, Raj confides to her that they had not\nconsummated their encounter, prompting Penny to refer to Raj as\n\"[Quickdraw](/wiki/Premature_ejaculation \"Premature ejaculation\")\" because of\nthat. She spends the rest of the episode with\n[Amy](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters#Amy_Farrah_Fowler \"List of\nThe Big Bang Theory characters\"), avoiding the men due to her embarrassment\nover her encounter with Raj\n\nIn \"The Ornithophobia Diffusion\" Leonard and Penny go on a platonic date as\nfriends, but after Leonard decides that he does not have to pay for everything\nor defer to her because they are not a couple, they end up bickering and\nsabotaging each other's attempts to socialize with members of the opposite\nsex. Penny realizes that she finds Leonard's more assertive demeanor\nattractive, but when he regresses to groveling in order to have sex with her,\nshe rebuffs him.\n\nOn the spur of the moment in \"The Recombination Hypothesis\", Leonard asks\nPenny out on a date after he imagines what getting back with her might be\nlike. In \"The Beta Test Initiation\", their date goes well until Leonard asks\nabout the status of their relationship. This causes conflict, due to Penny's\nsubsequent admission that commitment frightens her, but they agree to take\ntheir relationship slowly. On a spur of the moment while having sex in \"The\nLaunch Acceleration\", however, Leonard proposes to her, causing Penny great\ndistress. After discussing the matter, Penny declines his proposal, while\naffirming her feelings for him, and her desire to remain with him. In the\nseason 6 episode \"The Date Night Variable\", Leonard wants a reluctant Penny to\ndefine their relationship. In \"The Decoupling Fluctuation\", she wonders if she\nis really in love with him, but cannot bring herself to discuss it with\nLeonard. In \"The Date Night Variable\", Raj shows up unannounced at a private\ndinner of Penny and Leonard's, and inserts himself into their discussion of\nwhere their relationship is headed. When Leonard complains that Penny has yet\nto say \"I love you\" to Leonard, Raj attempts to get her to say it, causing\nPenny to eject him from the apartment.\n\nIn \"The 43 Peculiarity\", Leonard becomes jealous of Penny's classmate, an\nattractive Englishman. At the end of the episode, Penny and Leonard discuss\nthis, during which Penny casually mentions that she loves him, which Leonard\nnotes is the first time she has said this to him. In \"The Egg Salad\nEquivalency\" Penny learns that Sheldon's attractive assistant Alex asked\nLeonard out to dinner and eventually admits to Leonard her own insecurity\nabout their relationship. After a major argument with Sheldon, Leonard\nsuggests moving in with Penny in \"The Spoiler Alert Segmentation\", but she\nindicates that she is not ready for this. In \"The Tangible Affection Proof\",\nLeonard again tries to propose to Penny on Valentine's Day, but she expresses\nthat she is not ready for this, and is unnerved by that level of commitment.\nThey resolve that when she is ready to get married, she can propose to him. In\n\"The Bon Voyage Reaction\", Penny deals with Leonard going off to Europe for a\nsummer science assignment, resolving that they are more secure in their\nrelationship.\n\nIn \"The Hesitation Ramification\", Penny, inebriated and frustrated over the\nstate of her acting career, proposes to Leonard, who is hesitant to answer,\ngiven the circumstances. Though this further frustrates Penny, she admits in\nthe following episode, \"The Occupation Recalibration\", that Leonard did the\nright thing.\n\nBy season 5, Penny has formed strong friendships with Doctors Amy Farrah\nFowler and Bernadette Rostenkowski, and the three are often seen spending time\ntogether. However, Amy and Bernadette occasionally prefer to meet without\nPenny, and often tease her incessantly.\n\nIn the penultimate episode of season 7, \"The Gorilla Dissolution\", she and\nLeonard become engaged, after Penny realizes that it is not fame she wants out\nof life, but happiness with Leonard. Throughout season 8, a running gag is\ntheir reluctance to decide upon a wedding date. In the season 8 finale, Penny\nasks Leonard to marry her that night in Las Vegas. Leonard happily accepts,\nbut during the journey, after Penny expresses happiness that they will get\nmarried while knowing everything about each other, Leonard confesses to having\nshared a drunken kiss with another woman while on the boat in Europe, though\nhe adds that the woman started it and he rejected her. Penny becomes hurt by\nthe revelation, and even though she claims to forgive Leonard, there is\nclearly tension between them, leaving the season ending in a cliffhanger as to\nwhether or not they will go through with the wedding.\n\nAt the beginning of season 9, Leonard and Penny marry, although not without\nsome initial problems. They both reveal that they were subconsciously trying\nto sabotage their relationship, feeling unworthy of the other. After an\naborted attempt for Leonard to move into Penny's apartment and live with his\nwife, Sheldon forces them to spend most of the nights a week in Leonard's old\nroom. Although CBS now refers to the character with the married name Penny\nHofstadter, it has not been explicitly indicated in series whether she took\nLeonard's surname.[47] In season 10, Sheldon moves into Penny's old apartment\nwith Amy allowing Penny and Leonard to live on their own as husband and wife.\n\n##\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nIn the original, unaired pilot of the series, the conception of the female\nlead was very different. She was called Katie, and was envisioned as \"a\nstreet-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior\". Sheldon and\nLeonard would \"approach her with honesty, to draw the real, sensitive Katie\nout\".[31] The role was played by [Amanda Walsh](/wiki/Amanda_Walsh \"Amanda\nWalsh\").[48] However, the test audiences reacted to the character negatively,\nseeing her as too mean. Because of this, the character was changed, and the\nrole was recast.[31]\n\nTom Jicha of the _[South Florida Sun-Sentinel](/wiki/South_Florida_Sun-\nSentinel \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\")_ praised Cuoco's portrayal of Penny,\nstating: \"Her character had the potential to be a bimbo, but she [Cucco] has\ndeveloped it into a fully fleshed-out woman, who isn't as book-smart as the\nother characters but is wiser in so many ways. She's also a great straight\nperson, who can get off zingers of her own\".[49]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [List of _The Big Bang Theory_ characters](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_characters \"List of The Big Bang Theory characters\")\n  * [List of _The Big Bang Theory_ episodes](/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_episodes \"List of The Big Bang Theory episodes\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Penny_\\(The_Big_Bang_Theory\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Whether Leonard And Penny Get Married On The Big Bang Theory Season 9 Premiere Revealed\"](http://comicbook.com/2015/08/28/whether-leonard-and-penny-get-married-on-the-big-bang-theory-sea/). _Comicbook.com_.
