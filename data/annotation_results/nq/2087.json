Horowitz said: \"I\nhesitate to use the word \"reboot.\" We're more thinking about it as a hybrid of\na lot of things. We're paying homage to the original premise, but there are\ncertain characters who are returning and some who are not. It's a combination\nof a lot of things, but what we're trying to do is go in a new direction but\nstay true to the spirit of what the show has always been.\"[59]\n\nIn July 2017, the creators announced that the series now take place in the\n[Seattle](/wiki/Seattle,_Washington \"Seattle, Washington\") neighborhood of\nHyperion Heights, which was created under a new and darker curse.
