It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the\nscientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field\nof chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of\natoms.\n\nThe word _atom_ comes from the [Ancient Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language\n\"Ancient Greek language\") adjective _atomos_ , meaning \"indivisible\".[1] 19th\ncentury chemists began using the term in connection with the growing number of\nirreducible chemical elements. While seemingly apropos, around the turn of the\n20th century, through various experiments with\n[electromagnetism](/wiki/Electromagnetism \"Electromagnetism\") and\n[radioactivity](/wiki/Radioactivity \"Radioactivity\"), physicists discovered\nthat the so-called \"uncuttable atom\" was actually a conglomerate of various\n[subatomic particles](/wiki/Subatomic_particle \"Subatomic particle\") (chiefly,\n[electrons](/wiki/Electron \"Electron\"), [protons](/wiki/Proton \"Proton\") and\n[neutrons](/wiki/Neutron \"Neutron\")) which can exist separately from each\nother. In fact, in certain extreme environments, such as [neutron\nstars](/wiki/Neutron_star \"Neutron star\"), extreme temperature and pressure\nprevents atoms from existing at all.\n\nSince atoms were found to be divisible, physicists later invented the term\n\"[elementary particles](/wiki/Elementary_particle \"Elementary particle\")\" to\ndescribe the \"uncuttable\", though not indestructible, parts of an atom. The\nfield of science which studies subatomic particles is [particle\nphysics](/wiki/Particle_physics \"Particle physics\"), and it is in this field\nthat physicists hope to discover the true fundamental nature of matter.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Philosophical atomism\n    * 1.2 John Dalton\n    * 1.3 Avogadro\n    * 1.4 Brownian Motion\n    * 1.5 Discovery of subatomic particles\n    * 1.6 Discovery of the nucleus\n    * 1.7 First steps toward a quantum physical model of the atom\n    * 1.8 Discovery of isotopes\n    * 1.9 Discovery of nuclear particles\n    * 1.10 Quantum physical models of the atom\n  * 2 See also\n  * 3 Notes\n  * 4 Further reading\n  * 5 External links\n\n## History\n\n### Philosophical atomism\n\nMain article: [Atomism](/wiki/Atomism \"Atomism\")\n\nThe idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old one, appearing\nin many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. The word \"atom\" was coined\nby the [ancient Greek philosophers](/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy \"Ancient\nGreek philosophy\") [Leucippus](/wiki/Leucippus \"Leucippus\") and his pupil\n[Democritus](/wiki/Democritus \"Democritus\").[2][3] However, these ideas were\nfounded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and\nexperimentation. Because of this, they could not convince everybody, so\natomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the nature of matter.\nIt was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by\nscientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that\ncould easily be explained using the concept of atoms.\n\n### John Dalton\n\nNear the end of the 18th century, two laws about chemical reactions emerged\nwithout referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was the [law of\nconservation of mass](/wiki/Conservation_of_mass \"Conservation of mass\"),\nformulated by [Antoine Lavoisier](/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier \"Antoine Lavoisier\")\nin 1789, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains\nconstant (that is, the reactants have the same mass as the products).[4] The\nsecond was the [law of definite proportions](/wiki/Law_of_definite_proportions\n\"Law of definite proportions\"). First proven by the French chemist [Joseph\nLouis Proust](/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Proust \"Joseph Louis Proust\") in 1799,[5]\nthis law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent\nelements, then the masses of the constituents will always have the same\nproportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.\n\n[John Dalton](/wiki/John_Dalton \"John Dalton\") studied and expanded upon this\nprevious work and developed the [law of multiple\nproportions](/wiki/Law_of_multiple_proportions \"Law of multiple proportions\"):\nif two elements can be combined to form a number of possible compounds, then\nthe ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass\nof the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers. For example:\nProust had studied [tin oxides](/wiki/Tin_oxide_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Tin oxide\n\\(disambiguation\\)\") and found that their masses were either 88.1% tin and\n11.9% oxygen or 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (these were [tin(II)\noxide](/wiki/Tin\\(II\\)_oxide \"Tin\\(II\\) oxide\") and [tin\ndioxide](/wiki/Tin_dioxide \"Tin dioxide\") respectively). Dalton noted from\nthese percentages that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of\noxygen; 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. Dalton found that an atomic theory of\nmatter could elegantly explain this common pattern in chemistry. In the case\nof Proust's tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two\noxygen atoms.[6]\n\nDalton believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbed different gases\nin different proportions - for example, he found that water absorbed [carbon\ndioxide](/wiki/Carbon_dioxide \"Carbon dioxide\") far better than it absorbed\n[nitrogen](/wiki/Nitrogen \"Nitrogen\").[7] Dalton hypothesized this was due to\nthe differences in mass and complexity of the gases' respective particles.\nIndeed, carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen\nmolecules (N2).\n\nDalton proposed that each chemical element is composed of atoms of a single,\nunique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means,\nthey can combine to form more complex structures ([chemical\ncompounds](/wiki/Chemical_compound \"Chemical compound\")). This marked the\nfirst truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his\nconclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical\nfashion.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Daltons_symbols.gif/220px-\nDaltons_symbols.gif)](/wiki/File:Daltons_symbols.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Daltons_symbols.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nVarious atoms and molecules as depicted in [John Dalton](/wiki/John_Dalton\n\"John Dalton\")'s _A New System of Chemical Philosophy_ (1808).\n\nIn 1803 Dalton orally presented his first list of relative atomic weights for\na number of substances. This paper was published in 1805, but he did not\ndiscuss there exactly how he obtained these figures.[7] The method was first\nrevealed in 1807 by his acquaintance [Thomas\nThomson](/wiki/Thomas_Thomson_\\(chemist\\) \"Thomas Thomson \\(chemist\\)\"), in\nthe third edition of Thomson's textbook, _A System of Chemistry_. Finally,\nDalton published a full account in his own textbook, _A New System of Chemical\nPhilosophy_ , 1808 and 1810.\n\nDalton estimated the atomic weights according to the mass ratios in which they\ncombined, with the hydrogen atom taken as unity. However, Dalton did not\nconceive that with some elements atoms exist in molecules—e.g. pure oxygen\nexists as O2. He also mistakenly believed that the simplest compound between\nany two elements is always one atom of each (so he thought water was HO, not\nH2O).[8] This, in addition to the crudity of his equipment, flawed his\nresults. For instance, in 1803 he believed that oxygen atoms were 5.5 times\nheavier than hydrogen atoms, because in water he measured 5.5 grams of oxygen\nfor every 1 gram of hydrogen and believed the formula for water was HO.\nAdopting better data, in 1806 he concluded that the atomic weight of oxygen\nmust actually be 7 rather than 5.5, and he retained this weight for the rest\nof his life. Others at this time had already concluded that the oxygen atom\nmust weigh 8 relative to hydrogen equals 1, if one assumes Dalton's formula\nfor the water molecule (HO), or 16 if one assumes the modern water formula\n(H2O).[9]\n\n### Avogadro\n\nThe flaw in Dalton's theory was corrected in principle in 1811 by [Amedeo\nAvogadro](/wiki/Amedeo_Avogadro \"Amedeo Avogadro\"). Avogadro had proposed that\nequal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain\nequal numbers of molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles does\nnot affect the volume that it occupies).[10] [Avogadro's\nlaw](/wiki/Avogadro%27s_law \"Avogadro's law\") allowed him to deduce the\ndiatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they\nreacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one\nliter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and\ntemperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form\ntwo particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate\nestimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a\nclear distinction between molecules and atoms.\n\n### Brownian Motion\n\nIn 1827, the British botanist [Robert\nBrown](/wiki/Robert_Brown_\\(Scottish_botanist_from_Montrose\\) \"Robert Brown\n\\(Scottish botanist from Montrose\\)\") observed that dust particles inside\npollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent\nreason. In 1905, [Albert Einstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein \"Albert Einstein\")\ntheorized that this [Brownian motion](/wiki/Brownian_motion \"Brownian motion\")\nwas caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and\ndeveloped a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it.[11] This model was\nvalidated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist [Jean\nPerrin](/wiki/Jean_Perrin \"Jean Perrin\"), thus providing additional validation\nfor particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).\n\n### Discovery of subatomic particles\n\nMain articles: [Electron](/wiki/Electron \"Electron\") and [Plum pudding\nmodel](/wiki/Plum_pudding_model \"Plum pudding model\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/JJ_Thomson_Crookes_Tube_Replica.jpg/300px-\nJJ_Thomson_Crookes_Tube_Replica.jpg)](/wiki/File:JJ_Thomson_Crookes_Tube_Replica.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/JJ_Thomson_Cathode_Ray_2_explained.svg/300px-\nJJ_Thomson_Cathode_Ray_2_explained.svg.png)](/wiki/File:JJ_Thomson_Cathode_Ray_2_explained.svg)\n\nThe cathode rays (blue) were emitted from the cathode, sharpened to a beam by\nthe slits, then deflected as they passed between the two electrified plates.\n\nAtoms were thought to be the smallest possible division of matter until 1897\nwhen [J.J. Thomson](/wiki/J.J._Thomson \"J.J. Thomson\") discovered the\n[electron](/wiki/Electron \"Electron\") through his work on [cathode\nrays](/wiki/Cathode_ray \"Cathode ray\").[12]\n\nA [Crookes tube](/wiki/Crookes_tube \"Crookes tube\") is a sealed glass\ncontainer in which two [electrodes](/wiki/Electrode \"Electrode\") are separated\nby a vacuum. When a [voltage](/wiki/Voltage \"Voltage\") is applied across the\nelectrodes, cathode rays are generated, creating a glowing patch where they\nstrike the glass at the opposite end of the tube. Through experimentation,\nThomson discovered that the rays could be deflected by an [electric\nfield](/wiki/Electric_field \"Electric field\") (in addition to [magnetic\nfields](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic field\"), which was already known). He\nconcluded that these rays, rather than being a form of light, were composed of\nvery light [negatively charged](/wiki/Electric_charge \"Electric charge\")\nparticles he called \"corpuscles\" (they would later be renamed electrons by\nother scientists). He measured the mass-to-charge ratio and discovered it was\n1800 times smaller than that of hydrogen, the smallest atom. These corpuscles\nwere a particle unlike any other previously known.\n\nThomson suggested that atoms were divisible, and that the corpuscles were\ntheir building blocks.[13] To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom,\nhe proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive\ncharge; this was the [plum pudding model](/wiki/Plum_pudding_model \"Plum\npudding model\")[14] as the electrons were embedded in the positive charge like\nplums in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not\nstationary).\n\n### Discovery of the nucleus\n\nMain article: [Rutherford model](/wiki/Rutherford_model \"Rutherford model\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Geiger-\nMarsden_experiment_expectation_and_result.svg/400px-Geiger-\nMarsden_experiment_expectation_and_result.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Geiger-\nMarsden_experiment_expectation_and_result.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Geiger-Marsden_experiment_expectation_and_result.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n**The Geiger-Marsden experiment**  \n_Left:_ Expected results: alpha particles passing through the plum pudding\nmodel of the atom with negligible deflection.  \n_Right:_ Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected by\nthe concentrated positive charge of the nucleus.\n\nThomson's [plum pudding model](/wiki/Plum_pudding_model \"Plum pudding model\")\nwas disproved in 1909 by one of his former students, [Ernest\nRutherford](/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford \"Ernest Rutherford\"), who discovered that\nmost of the mass and positive charge of an atom is concentrated in a very\nsmall fraction of its volume, which he assumed to be at the very center.\n\nIn the [Geiger–Marsden experiment](/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment\n\"Geiger–Marsden experiment\"), [Hans Geiger](/wiki/Hans_Geiger \"Hans Geiger\")\nand [Ernest Marsden](/wiki/Ernest_Marsden \"Ernest Marsden\") (colleagues of\nRutherford working at his behest) shot [alpha particles](/wiki/Alpha_particle\n\"Alpha particle\") at thin sheets of metal and measured their deflection\nthrough the use of a [fluorescent screen](/wiki/Fluorescence\n\"Fluorescence\").[15] Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high\nmomentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive\ncharge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha\nparticles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To\ntheir astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy\ndeflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be\nconcentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently\nintense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.\n\nThis led Rutherford to propose a [planetary model](/wiki/Rutherford_model\n\"Rutherford model\") in which a cloud of electrons surrounded a small, compact\nnucleus of positive charge. Only such a concentration of charge could produce\nthe electric field strong enough to cause the heavy deflection.[16]\n\n### First steps toward a quantum physical model of the atom\n\nMain article: [Bohr model](/wiki/Bohr_model \"Bohr model\")\n\nThe planetary model of the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is\nthat, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An\naccelerating [electric charge](/wiki/Electric_charge \"Electric charge\") is\nknown to emit [electromagnetic waves](/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave\n\"Electromagnetic wave\") according to the [Larmor formula](/wiki/Larmor_formula\n\"Larmor formula\") in [classical\nelectromagnetism](/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism \"Classical\nelectromagnetism\"). An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral\ntoward the nucleus, colliding with it in a small fraction of a second. The\nsecond problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly\npeaked [emission](/wiki/Emission_spectrum \"Emission spectrum\") and [absorption\nspectra](/wiki/Absorption_spectrum \"Absorption spectrum\") of atoms that were\nobserved.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Bohr_atom_animation_2.gif/220px-\nBohr_atom_animation_2.gif)](/wiki/File:Bohr_atom_animation_2.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bohr_atom_animation_2.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Bohr model](/wiki/Bohr_model \"Bohr model\") of the atom\n\n[Quantum theory](/wiki/Quantum_mechanics \"Quantum mechanics\") revolutionized\nphysics at the beginning of the 20th century, when [Max\nPlanck](/wiki/Max_Planck \"Max Planck\") and [Albert\nEinstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein \"Albert Einstein\") postulated that light\nenergy is emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts known as\n[quanta](/wiki/Quantum \"Quantum\") (singular, _quantum_). In 1913, [Niels\nBohr](/wiki/Niels_Bohr \"Niels Bohr\") incorporated this idea into his [Bohr\nmodel](/wiki/Bohr_model \"Bohr model\") of the atom, in which an electron could\nonly orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed [angular\nmomentum](/wiki/Angular_momentum \"Angular momentum\") and energy, its distance\nfrom the nucleus (i.e., their radii) being proportional to its energy.[17]\nUnder this model an electron could not spiral into the nucleus because it\ncould not lose energy in a continuous manner; instead, it could only make\ninstantaneous \"[quantum leaps](/wiki/Atomic_electron_transition \"Atomic\nelectron transition\")\" between the fixed [energy levels](/wiki/Energy_level\n\"Energy level\").[17] When this occurred, light was emitted or absorbed at a\nfrequency proportional to the change in energy (hence the absorption and\nemission of light in discrete spectra).[17]\n\nBohr's model was not perfect. It could only predict the [spectral\nlines](/wiki/Spectral_line \"Spectral line\") of hydrogen; it couldn't predict\nthose of multielectron atoms. Worse still, as [spectrographic\ntechnology](/wiki/Spectrophotometry \"Spectrophotometry\") improved, additional\nspectral lines in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't explain.\nIn 1916, [Arnold Sommerfeld](/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld \"Arnold Sommerfeld\")\nadded elliptical orbits to the Bohr model to explain the extra emission lines,\nbut this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn't explain\nmore complex atoms.\n\n### Discovery of isotopes\n\nMain article: [Isotope](/wiki/Isotope \"Isotope\")\n\nWhile experimenting with the products of [radioactive\ndecay](/wiki/Radioactive_decay \"Radioactive decay\"), in 1913\n[radiochemist](/wiki/Radiochemistry \"Radiochemistry\") [Frederick\nSoddy](/wiki/Frederick_Soddy \"Frederick Soddy\") discovered that there appeared\nto be more than one element at each position on the [periodic\ntable](/wiki/Periodic_table \"Periodic table\").[18] The term\n[isotope](/wiki/Isotope \"Isotope\") was coined by [Margaret\nTodd](/wiki/Margaret_Todd_\\(doctor\\) \"Margaret Todd \\(doctor\\)\") as a suitable\nname for these elements.\n\nThat same year, [J.J. Thomson](/wiki/J.J._Thomson \"J.J. Thomson\") conducted an\nexperiment in which he channeled a stream of [neon](/wiki/Neon \"Neon\")\n[ions](/wiki/Ion \"Ion\") through magnetic and electric fields, striking a\nphotographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the\nplate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson\nconcluded this was because some of the neon ions had a different mass.[19] The\nnature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of\n[neutrons](/wiki/Neutron \"Neutron\") in 1932.\n\n### Discovery of nuclear particles\n\nMain articles: [Atomic nucleus](/wiki/Atomic_nucleus \"Atomic nucleus\") and\n[Discovery of the neutron](/wiki/Discovery_of_the_neutron \"Discovery of the\nneutron\")\n\nIn 1917 [Rutherford](/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford \"Ernest Rutherford\") bombarded\n[nitrogen](/wiki/Nitrogen \"Nitrogen\") gas with [alpha\nparticles](/wiki/Alpha_particle \"Alpha particle\") and observed\n[hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen \"Hydrogen\") nuclei being emitted from the gas\n(Rutherford recognized these, because he had previously obtained them\nbombarding hydrogen with alpha particles, and observing hydrogen nuclei in the\nproducts). Rutherford concluded that the hydrogen nuclei emerged from the\nnuclei of the nitrogen atoms themselves (in effect, he had split a\nnitrogen).[20]\n\nFrom his own work and the work of his students Bohr and [Henry\nMoseley](/wiki/Henry_Moseley \"Henry Moseley\"), Rutherford knew that the\npositive charge of any atom could always be equated to that of an integer\nnumber of hydrogen nuclei. This, coupled with the [atomic\nmass](/wiki/Atomic_mass \"Atomic mass\") of many elements being [roughly\nequivalent](/wiki/Prout%27s_law \"Prout's law\") to an integer number of\nhydrogen atoms - then assumed to be the lightest particles - led him to\nconclude that hydrogen nuclei were singular particles and a basic constituent\nof all atomic nuclei. He named such particles [protons](/wiki/Proton\n\"Proton\"). Further experimentation by Rutherford found that the nuclear mass\nof most atoms exceeded that of the protons it possessed; he speculated that\nthis surplus mass was composed of previously-unknown neutrally charged\nparticles, which were tentatively dubbed \"[neutrons](/wiki/Neutron\n\"Neutron\")\".\n\nIn 1928, [Walter Bothe](/wiki/Walter_Bothe \"Walter Bothe\") observed that\n[beryllium](/wiki/Beryllium \"Beryllium\") emitted a highly penetrating,\nelectrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. It was\nlater discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of\n[paraffin wax](/wiki/Paraffin_wax \"Paraffin wax\"). Initially it was thought to\nbe high-energy [gamma radiation](/wiki/Gamma_radiation \"Gamma radiation\"),\nsince gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals, but [James\nChadwick](/wiki/James_Chadwick \"James Chadwick\") found that the\n[ionization](/wiki/Ionization \"Ionization\") effect was too strong for it to be\ndue to electromagnetic radiation, so long as energy and momentum were\nconserved in the interaction. In 1932, Chadwick exposed various elements, such\nas hydrogen and nitrogen, to the mysterious \"beryllium radiation\", and by\nmeasuring the energies of the recoiling charged particles, he deduced that the\nradiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could\nnot be massless like the gamma ray, but instead were required to have a mass\nsimilar to that of a proton. Chadwick now claimed these particles as\nRutherford's neutrons.[21] For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick received\nthe Nobel Prize in 1935.\n\n### Quantum physical models of the atom\n\nMain article: [Atomic orbital](/wiki/Atomic_orbital \"Atomic orbital\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/S-p-\nOrbitals.svg/220px-S-p-Orbitals.svg.png)](/wiki/File:S-p-Orbitals.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:S-p-Orbitals.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe five filled atomic orbitals of a neon atom separated and arranged in order\nof increasing energy from left to right, with the last three orbitals being\n[equal in energy](/wiki/Degenerate_energy_level \"Degenerate energy level\").\nEach orbital holds up to two electrons, which most probably exist in the zones\nrepresented by the colored bubbles. Each electron is equally present in both\norbital zones, shown here by color only to highlight the different wave phase.\n\nIn 1924, [Louis de Broglie](/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie \"Louis de Broglie\")\nproposed that all moving particles—particularly subatomic particles such as\nelectrons—exhibit a degree of wave-like behavior. [Erwin\nSchrödinger](/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger \"Erwin Schrödinger\"), fascinated by\nthis idea, explored whether or not the movement of an electron in an atom\ncould be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle. [Schrödinger's\nequation](/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_equation \"Schrödinger's equation\"),\npublished in 1926,[22] describes an electron as a\n[wavefunction](/wiki/Wavefunction \"Wavefunction\") instead of as a point\nparticle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena\nthat Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically\nconvenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition.[23] One of\nits critics, [Max Born](/wiki/Max_Born \"Max Born\"), proposed instead that\nSchrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its\npossible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of\nfinding an electron at any given location around the nucleus.[24] This\nreconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the\nidea of wave–particle duality was introduced. This theory stated that the\nelectron may exhibit the properties of both a wave and a particle. For\nexample, it can be refracted like a wave, and has mass like a particle.[25]\n\nA consequence of describing electrons as waveforms is that it is\nmathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum\nof an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg [uncertainty\nprinciple](/wiki/Uncertainty_principle \"Uncertainty principle\") after the\ntheoretical physicist [Werner Heisenberg](/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg \"Werner\nHeisenberg\"), who first described it and published it in 1927.[26] This\ninvalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The\n[modern model of the atom](/wiki/Atomic_orbital_model \"Atomic orbital model\")\ndescribes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An\nelectron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but,\ndepending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions\naround the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its [atomic\norbital](/wiki/Atomic_orbital \"Atomic orbital\"). The orbitals come in a\nvariety of shapes-[sphere](/wiki/Sphere \"Sphere\"), [dumbbell](/wiki/Dumbbell\n\"Dumbbell\"), [torus](/wiki/Torus \"Torus\"), etc.-with the nucleus in the\nmiddle.[27]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Stylised_atom_with_three_Bohr_model_orbits_and_stylised_nucleus.svg/25px-Stylised_atom_with_three_Bohr_model_orbits_and_stylised_nucleus.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Stylised_atom_with_three_Bohr_model_orbits_and_stylised_nucleus.svg)[Physics portal](/wiki/Portal:Physics \"Portal:Physics\")\n\n  * [Spectroscopy](/wiki/Spectroscopy \"Spectroscopy\")\n  * [History of the molecule](/wiki/History_of_the_molecule \"History of the molecule\")\n  * [Discoveries of the chemical elements](/wiki/Discoveries_of_the_chemical_elements \"Discoveries of the chemical elements\")\n  * [Introduction to quantum mechanics](/wiki/Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics \"Introduction to quantum mechanics\")\n  * [Kinetic theory of gases](/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases \"Kinetic theory of gases\")\n  * [Atomism](/wiki/Atomism \"Atomism\")\n  * _[The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory](/wiki/The_Physical_Principles_of_the_Quantum_Theory \"The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory\")_\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Berryman, Sylvia, \"Ancient Atomism\", _[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](/wiki/Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\")_ (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N.
