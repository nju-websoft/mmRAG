Prior to [2017](/wiki/2017_NFL_season \"2017 NFL season\"), the ball was placed at the 20-yard line.\n  * Update the standards for a \"catch\" to have: \n    * Two feet down or any body part other than the hands\n    * Control of the ball\n    * Make a \"football move\" such as making a 3rd step, reaching/extending to the line to gain, tucking the ball away, warding off defensive players, or have the ability to perform such an act.\n\n    The rule for receivers who were going to the ground during the catch process has been deleted. This is in response to several issues regarding the \"going to the ground\" rule, especially catches by [Dallas Cowboys](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\") WR [Dez Bryant](/wiki/Dez_Bryant \"Dez Bryant\") in the 2014 NFL playoffs and one by [Pittsburgh Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") TE [Jesse James](/wiki/Jesse_James_\\(American_football\\) \"Jesse James \\(American football\\)\") in 2017 that were overturned due to this rule.\n  * Allow a designated member of the officiating department (for 2018, NFL Senior VP of Officiating Al Riveron) to instruct game officials to disqualify any player who commits a flagrant non-football act on the field for a foul called on the field. This is in response to a situation where [New England Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\") tight end [Rob Gronkowski](/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski \"Rob Gronkowski\") intentionally inflicted a late hit on [Buffalo Bills](/wiki/Buffalo_Bills \"Buffalo Bills\") defensive back [Tre'Davious White](/wiki/Tre%27Davious_White \"Tre'Davious White\") causing a concussion to White. Gronkowski was not ejected for the foul on the field, but did receive a one-game suspension after the NFL's review of the play.\n  * Illegally batting a ball on a scrimmage down will incur a loss of down in addition to the previous 10-yard penalty.\n  * In overtime, when a team is ahead by 3 points, a down will run to its conclusion and all applicable points will score, even if there is a loss of possession. Previously, the offense of the trailing team could not legally score if they lost and regained possession and reached the opponent's end zone all on the same play. The rule remains that if there is a double change of possession on a play with one team in the lead, it is the last play of the game.\n  * If a team scores a touchdown on the final play of regulation which gives them the victory, no extra-point conversion try will be needed.[74]\n  * A quarterback may slide either head first or feet first to be considered giving himself up on the play, and he is afforded all protections previously provided to a quarterback sliding feet first.\n\nThe following bylaws and resolutions were passed:[75]\n\n  * Make permanent the liberalization of workout rules for draft prospects.\n  * For a one-year trial period, liberalize the rules for re-signing a player on waivers.\n  * Players on injured reserve can be traded.\n  * Players with injuries deemed major can be placed directly on injured reserve without clearing waivers.\n  * The 10-day postseason waiver claiming period has been reduced to 1 day.\n  * Players can be activated from injured reserve after eight games instead of eight weeks.\n  * Teams have seven business days to complete an injury settlement instead of five.\n  * Players in certain reserve list categories cannot be reinstated after a team's week 13 game. This restriction was previously applied to the last 30 days of the regular season.\n  * Clarify roster procedures for players with military obligations.\n  * For a one-year trial period, teams may contact a player who has been publicly announced to be released before the NFL lists the transaction on a Player Personnel Notice.\n\nThe following changes to the kickoff rules were approved at the NFL Spring\nOwners' Meeting on May 23, 2018:[76]\n\n  * Players are required to line up for the kickoff as follows: \n    * Five players on the kicking team must be on either side of the kicker\n    * Two players on each side must be lined up outside of the numbers and two additional players on each side must be lined up between the numbers and the hashmarks\n    * Players on the kicking team (excluding the kicker) may only line up within one yard of the kickoff spot (currently this is limited to five yards)\n    * The receiving team must have eight players in a fifteen-yard \"set-up zone\" (from the restraining line ten yards from the kickoff spot, fifteen yards back)\n  * No wedge blocks. Players would only be able to do a double-team block within the \"set-up zone\".\n  * Blocking is prohibited inside the restraining zone (10 yards from the kickoff spot) until the ball touches the ground or is touched in the field of play.\n  * Once a kickoff lands in the end zone, it would become an automatic touchback. Players will no longer have to \"kneel\" in the end zone to stop the play.\n  * Any player(s) being disqualified are subject to replay review.\n  * It is now a foul (15 yards) for players to lower their helmet to initiate and make contact with an opposing player. The fouling player risks disqualification if: \n    * Player lowers his helmet to establish a linear body posture prior to initiating or making contact with the helmet\n    * Player delivering the blow had an unobstructed path to his opponent\n    * Contact was clearly avoidable (player delivering the blow had other options)\n\nIn response to the recent [National Anthem protests in the league the past two\nseasons](/wiki/U.S._national_anthem_protests_\\(2016%E2%80%93present\\) \"U.S.\nnational anthem protests \\(2016–present\\)\"), any player or staff member who is\non the field during the performance of \"[The Star-Spangled\nBanner](/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner \"The Star-Spangled Banner\")\" must stand\nfor the duration of the performance. Such players and staff members are not\nrequired to be on the field at that time and may wait in the locker room as an\nalternative. The NFL will not directly fine offending players or staff members\nfor defying the rule, instead fining the teams, who will in turn have power to\nfine the players or staff members at their own discretion.

And Fox kept both [Mike Pereira](/wiki/Mike_Pereira\n\"Mike Pereira\") and [Dean Blandino](/wiki/Dean_Blandino \"Dean Blandino\").\nAdditionally, Pereira assists with Fox’s Thursday Night Football Coverage.\n\nESPN will introduce a fully new broadcast team for _Monday Night Football_.\n[Joe Tessitore](/wiki/Joe_Tessitore \"Joe Tessitore\") will replace [Sean\nMcDonough](/wiki/Sean_McDonough \"Sean McDonough\") as lead play-by-play man;\nMcDonough will remain with ESPN as a college football announcer.[184][185]\nWith previous color analyst [Jon Gruden](/wiki/Jon_Gruden \"Jon Gruden\")\nreturning to coaching, _Monday Night Football_ hired [Jason\nWitten](/wiki/Jason_Witten \"Jason Witten\") and [Booger\nMcFarland](/wiki/Booger_McFarland \"Booger McFarland\") as their color\ncommentators; while McFarland offers his commentary from the sidelines, he\nfills a role similar to the \"non-football\" player position that _Monday Night\nFootball_ has traditionally relied upon in its past three-person booths (such\nas [Howard Cosell](/wiki/Howard_Cosell \"Howard Cosell\"), [Dennis\nMiller](/wiki/Dennis_Miller \"Dennis Miller\") and [Tony\nKornheiser](/wiki/Tony_Kornheiser \"Tony Kornheiser\")).[186] [Lisa\nSalters](/wiki/Lisa_Salters \"Lisa Salters\"), the sideline reporter, carries\nover from the previous broadcast team.[187] [Jeff\nTriplette](/wiki/Jeff_Triplette \"Jeff Triplette\") will replace [Gerald\nAustin](/wiki/Gerald_Austin \"Gerald Austin\") as rules analyst.[188]\n\nFox initially had planned to hire a new broadcast team for its _Thursday Night\nFootball_ , making an overture to [Peyton Manning](/wiki/Peyton_Manning\n\"Peyton Manning\") to serve as color commentator. Since Manning declined the\noffer, the network announced that it will be placing its existing lead\nbroadcast team of [Joe Buck](/wiki/Joe_Buck \"Joe Buck\") and [Troy\nAikman](/wiki/Troy_Aikman \"Troy Aikman\") on the package, reducing the number\nof games the duo will call on Sundays (Buck and Aikman will only call the\nnationally televised \"America's Game of the Week\" telecasts on Sundays).[189]\nA version of _[Fox NFL Sunday](/wiki/Fox_NFL_Sunday \"Fox NFL Sunday\")_ will\nserve as the [lead-in](/wiki/Lead-in \"Lead-in\") to _Thursday Night Football_ ,\nalbeit without [Curt Menefee](/wiki/Curt_Menefee \"Curt Menefee\") or [Jimmy\nJohnson](/wiki/Jimmy_Johnson_\\(American_football_coach\\) \"Jimmy Johnson\n\\(American football coach\\)\"); the show will instead be hosted by panelist\n[Michael Strahan](/wiki/Michael_Strahan \"Michael Strahan\") from New York City,\ndisplacing [Rich Eisen](/wiki/Rich_Eisen \"Rich Eisen\"), the studio host for\nThursday night pregame since the package's inception in 2006.[190] Strahan\nwill be joined by fellow Fox colleagues [Terry Bradshaw](/wiki/Terry_Bradshaw\n\"Terry Bradshaw\") and [Howie Long](/wiki/Howie_Long \"Howie Long\").\n\nIn previous seasons, Buck did not call any NFL games during late October,\nworking [Major League Baseball](/wiki/Major_League_Baseball \"Major League\nBaseball\") playoff games instead. For 2018, Fox coordinated its schedule with\nMLB so that none of its scheduled broadcasts would land on a Thursday (Fox\ncarries the [NLCS](/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series \"National League\nChampionship Series\") and the World Series), so Buck will continue to\nbroadcast both sports, crisscrossing the country in seven cities over a 22-day\nperiod.[191]\n\nIn addition, NBC will introduce a new studio team for _[Football Night in\nAmerica](/wiki/Football_Night_in_America \"Football Night in America\")_. [Mike\nTirico](/wiki/Mike_Tirico \"Mike Tirico\"), who was the on-site host and\nsecondary play-by-play announcer in 2017, became the show's studio host from\n[Stanford, Connecticut](/wiki/Stanford,_Connecticut \"Stanford, Connecticut\"),\nwith [Liam McHugh](/wiki/Liam_McHugh \"Liam McHugh\") moving into Tirico's\nformer role. [Dan Patrick](/wiki/Dan_Patrick \"Dan Patrick\"), who had been the\nstudio host for _FNiA_ since 2008, declined to sign a long-term contract and\nleft NBC.[192]\n\nOn radio, [Kurt Warner](/wiki/Kurt_Warner \"Kurt Warner\") will replace [Boomer\nEsiason](/wiki/Boomer_Esiason \"Boomer Esiason\") as the color commentator for\nWestwood One's _Monday Night Football_ broadcasts, after Esiason had filled\nthe role for the previous 18 years. Esiason will continue as a studio host for\nCBS, along with his existing duties on the [CBS Sports\nNetwork](/wiki/CBS_Sports_Network \"CBS Sports Network\")-simulcast _[Boomer and\nGio](/wiki/Boomer_and_Gio \"Boomer and Gio\")_ from [WFAN](/wiki/WFAN_\\(AM\\)\n\"WFAN \\(AM\\)\").[193]\n\nIn a surprise announcement made two days before its first game, Amazon\nannounced it would provide its own broadcast team for its eleven games, with\n[Hannah Storm](/wiki/Hannah_Storm \"Hannah Storm\") and [Andrea\nKremer](/wiki/Andrea_Kremer \"Andrea Kremer\") serving as the lead broadcast\nteam. The announcement makes Kremer the first-ever female color analyst for an\nNFL game, the first time a game has been broadcast with no men involved in the\nbroadcast team, and the first time since [Tony\nKornheiser](/wiki/Tony_Kornheiser \"Tony Kornheiser\") left _Monday Night\nFootball_ that the color analyst had no coaching or playing experience. Amazon\nwill offer the standard Fox broadcast team, a British broadcasting team, and a\nSpanish language feed as alternate audio choices.[194]\n\n### Start time\nchanges[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2018_NFL_season&action=edit&section=49 \"Edit\nsection: Start time changes\")]\n\nThe start times for Thursday, Sunday, and Monday Night Football broadcasts\nwill be moved up 5 to 15 minutes.
