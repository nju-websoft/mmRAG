The show revolved around a multi-\ngenerational family living under one roof in [Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta\n\"Atlanta\") led by patriarch [Curtis Payne](/wiki/Curtis_Payne \"Curtis Payne\")\nand his wife [Ella](/wiki/Ella_Payne \"Ella Payne\"). The show premiered in\n[syndication](/wiki/Broadcast_syndication \"Broadcast syndication\") on June 21,\n2006, and new episodes of a retooled version were broadcast exclusively on\n[TBS](/wiki/TBS_\\(TV_network\\) \"TBS \\(TV network\\)\") from June 6, 2007, until\nAugust 10, 2012.[1] While primarily a comedy [sitcom](/wiki/Sitcom \"Sitcom\"),\n_House of Payne_ was known for featuring dark themes and subject matter, such\nas [substance abuse](/wiki/Substance_abuse \"Substance abuse\") and\n[addiction](/wiki/Substance_dependence \"Substance dependence\"). It also had\nelements of [slapstick](/wiki/Slapstick \"Slapstick\").[2] The storyline of the\nshow is serialized, with many references to past episodes, creating a\ncontinuing [story arc](/wiki/Story_arc \"Story arc\"). With a total of 254\nepisodes, _House of Payne_ aired more episodes than any other television\nseries with a predominantly [African American](/wiki/African_American \"African\nAmerican\") cast, surpassing _[The Jeffersons](/wiki/The_Jeffersons \"The\nJeffersons\")_ with 253 episodes, _[Family Matters](/wiki/Family_Matters\n\"Family Matters\")_ with 215 episodes and _[The Cosby\nShow](/wiki/The_Cosby_Show \"The Cosby Show\")_ with 202 episodes.[3] In 2017,\nthe [Oprah Winfrey Network](/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey_Network_\\(U.S._TV_channel\\)\n\"Oprah Winfrey Network \\(U.S. TV channel\\)\") ordered a spin-off series titled\n_[The Paynes](/wiki/The_Paynes \"The Paynes\"),_ with 38 episodes and the\noriginal cast returning to reprise their roles. The series premiered on\nJanuary 16, 2018.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Production history\n  * 2 Episodes\n  * 3 Cast\n    * 3.1 Main\n    * 3.2 Recurring\n      * 3.2.1 The Hernandez family\n  * 4 Setting\n  * 5 Other Cast\n  * 6 NAACP Image Awards & Nominations\n  * 7 Special appearances\n  * 8 Syndicated reruns\n    * 8.1 _Madea_ connections\n    * 8.2 _Meet the Browns_ crossovers\n  * 9 Releases\n  * 10 References\n  * 11 External links\n\n## Production\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Production history\")]\n\nThe sitcom ran in [first-run syndication](/wiki/First-run_syndication \"First-\nrun syndication\") for 10 episodes during mid-2006 on the Atlanta-area\nbroadcast of [WPCH-TV](/wiki/WPCH-TV \"WPCH-TV\"), along with nine other\nbroadcast outlets across the country, as a limited run, with additional\nepisodes to be available for national distribution on\n[TBS](/wiki/TBS_\\(TV_network\\) \"TBS \\(TV network\\)\") in June 2007. An order of\n100 episodes was later requested by TBS.\n\nA cable record for sitcom airings was broken with 5.2 and 5.8 million for the\ntwo premiere episodes on TBS on June 6, 2007.[5] However, the audience\ndeclined to 4.3 million as of the week ending September 30, 2007 and 2.260 and\n2.099 as of May 19, 2010.[6]\n\nThe principal cast remained the same (with the exception of [Lance\nGross](/wiki/Lance_Gross \"Lance Gross\") being added), led by LaVan Davis. The\noriginal format of the series centred around C.J. ([Allen\nPayne](/wiki/Allen_Payne \"Allen Payne\")) and his family moving in with his\nAunt Ella and Uncle [Curtis](/wiki/Curtis_Payne \"Curtis Payne\") ([Cassi\nDavis](/wiki/Cassi_Davis \"Cassi Davis\") and LaVan Davis). [Robinne\nLee](/wiki/Robinne_Lee \"Robinne Lee\") had a recurring guest stint in Season\n1–2 as Malik and Jazmine's principal, Nicole Jamieson, whom C.J. soon began\ndating. [Rochelle Aytes](/wiki/Rochelle_Aytes \"Rochelle Aytes\") originally\nportrayed Nicole Jamieson in the test pilot episodes as Malik's math teacher.\nIn the test run, Ella and Curtis were originally C.J.'s parents, but in its\ntelevised format, Calvin is their son and C.J. their nephew. Despite his top\nbilling, Allen Payne is not considered the main actor of the series,\nespecially due to his long absence in the fifth season. The show was recorded\nin front of a live studio audience but sometimes used a laugh track.\n\nAt the beginning of the fifth season, [China Anne\nMcClain](/wiki/China_Anne_McClain \"China Anne McClain\") (Jazmine) and [Denise\nBurse](/wiki/Denise_Burse \"Denise Burse\") (Claretha) were removed from the\nseries. The characters were written out, with Jazmine going away to a school\nfor gifted children in North Carolina and Claretha marrying a prince and\nmoving away. In real life, McClain and Burse left the series for undisclosed\nreasons. In the beginning of Season 6, both McClain and Burse returned. Some\nof the cast members of _Tyler Perry 's House of Payne_ were on _[The Mo'Nique\nShow](/wiki/The_Mo%27Nique_Show \"The Mo'Nique Show\")_ in October 2009.\nBeginning with the seventh season, China Anne McClain appeared infrequently\ndue to her work schedule for _[A.N.T. Farm](/wiki/A.N.T._Farm \"A.N.T. Farm\")_.\nDenise Burse was no longer credited as a regular cast member; she appeared in\na recurring role.\n\n[Larramie \"Doc\" Shaw](/wiki/Larramie_%22Doc%22_Shaw \"Larramie \"Doc\" Shaw\"),\nwho portrayed Malik, appeared infrequently after the sixth season. This was\ndue to Shaw's work schedules for _[The Suite Life on\nDeck](/wiki/The_Suite_Life_on_Deck \"The Suite Life on Deck\")_ and _[Pair of\nKings](/wiki/Pair_of_Kings \"Pair of Kings\")_. He remained a cast member\nthroughout the series.\n\nTyler Perry directed every episode of the first 5 seasons. Throughout Season\n6, each episode was directed by actress [Kim Fields](/wiki/Kim_Fields \"Kim\nFields\") or her mother [Chip Hurd](/wiki/Chip_Fields \"Chip Fields\"). Tyler\nPerry directed some of the episodes in seasons 7 and 8 while other episodes\nwere directed by Kim Fields, Chip Hurd, and producer [Roger M.\nBobb](/wiki/Roger_M._Bobb \"Roger M. Bobb\").\n\nDuring the first 5 seasons, the show was rated TV-PG but due to a rapid\nincrease of strong language and mature content (particularly sexual), later\nepisodes are rated TV-14. On September 28, 2011, TBS ordered 42 episodes.[7]\nNewer episodes have been aired on TBS since October 21, 2011 with season 8,\nand concluded the series with a total of 254 episodes. The show aired its\nfinal two episodes on August 10, 2012.\n\nOn January 30, 2017, a spin-off follow-up series entitled _The Paynes_ was\nordered by [Oprah Winfrey\nNetwork](/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey_Network_\\(U.S._TV_channel\\) \"Oprah Winfrey\nNetwork \\(U.S. TV channel\\)\"). It will follow Ella and Curtis Payne as they\nenjoy retirement in Florida only to get caught in a real estate deal that will\nturn their lives upside down. The series was greenlighted for 38 episodes and\npremiered in early 2018.[8]\n\n##\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Tyler Perry's House of Payne\nepisodes](/wiki/List_of_Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne_episodes \"List of Tyler\nPerry's House of Payne episodes\")\n\nSeason| Episodes| Originally aired  \n---|---|---  \nFirst aired| Last aired  \n| [1](/wiki/List_of_Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne_episodes#Season_1_\\(2007\\)\n\"List of Tyler Perry's House of Payne episodes\")| 37| June 6, 2007\n(2007-06-06)| September 26, 2007 (2007-09-26)  \n|\n[2](/wiki/List_of_Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne_episodes#Season_2_\\(2007–08\\)\n\"List of Tyler Perry's House of Payne episodes\")| 22| December 5, 2007\n(2007-12-05)| January 30, 2008 (2008-01-30)  \n| [3](/wiki/List_of_Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne_episodes#Season_3_\\(2008\\)\n\"List of Tyler Perry's House of Payne episodes\")| 16| March 5, 2008\n(2008-03-05)| April 23, 2008 (2008-04-23)  \n| [4](/wiki/List_of_Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne_episodes#Season_4_\\(2008\\)\n\"List of Tyler Perry's House of Payne episodes\")| 25| June 4, 2008\n(2008-06-04)| August 6, 2008 (2008-08-06)  \n|\n[5](/wiki/List_of_Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne_episodes#Season_5_\\(2008–09\\)\n\"List of Tyler Perry's House of Payne episodes\")| 26| December 3, 2008\n(2008-12-03)| June 3, 2009 (2009-06-03)  \n|\n[6](/wiki/List_of_Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne_episodes#Season_6_\\(2009-11\\)\n\"List of Tyler Perry's House of Payne episodes\")| 46| November 4, 2009\n(2009-11-04)| January 19, 2011 (2011-01-19)  \n| [7](/wiki/List_of_Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne_episodes#Season_7_\\(2011\\)\n\"List of Tyler Perry's House of Payne episodes\")| 20| March 30, 2011\n(2011-03-30)| June 15, 2011 (2011-06-15)  \n|\n[8](/wiki/List_of_Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne_episodes#Season_8_\\(2011–12\\)\n\"List of Tyler Perry's House of Payne episodes\")| 62| October 21, 2011\n(2011-10-21)| August 10, 2012 (2012-08-10)  \n  \n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n_House of Payne_ revolves around the Payne family who reside in the suburban\n[Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta \"Atlanta\").

He is often referred to as Uncle Curtis by his nephew C.J., his nephew's wife Janine, and their children, Malik and Jazmine. Curtis is known for his hackneyed jokes, overly loud delivery, and acting like a negative racial stereotype. He is overweight and has fainted once from a blocked artery, but he ignored the diet his wife Ella set for him, and is unable to stay away from his usual fatty foods. A noticeable running gag is when he jokingly pushes Ella to the side with one arm when he wants to go by, she usually lands on the sofa. Despite his immaturity in this matter, his maturity and responsibility are apparent in his job as the chief of the local fire department. In one episode, his middle name was revealed as Booker T. In the sixth season, Curtis was forced to retire which left him depressed and humiliated for a period of time; he eventually embraced it and his nephew C.J. took over his old job. LaVan Davis won an [NAACP Image Awards](/wiki/NAACP_Image_Awards \"NAACP Image Awards\") in 2008 for Outstanding Actor In A Comedy Series for this role. In the first part of the series finale, \"The Call Back\", CJ asks Curtis to come out of retirement to oversee three stations that CJ runs. At first Curtis refuses to do it, and yells at CJ saying how they already forced him into retirement, and that he wasn't going back, but at the end of the episode, after talking with Ella, he decided to return.\n  * **Ella Payne (née Ella Williams)** (known as Ella Williams in episode \"Til Payne Do We Part\") **([Cassi Davis](/wiki/Cassi_Davis \"Cassi Davis\"))**, is Curtis's wife. She is a stay-at-home mother and the voice of reason. Curtis has been known to take advantage of Ella's good nature—and to be punished for it. Ella is the family's religious voice and the glue that holds it together. A good cook, she had a restaurant service in one episode. She is quick to offer emotional and moral support to everyone in the family, such as when Janine returned home. In the fifth season, she briefly worked in retail. In Season 6, she quits to go back to school. Ella graduated from college and finally got her degree in Season 7. It is revealed that her middle name is Naomi. She tries to keep the family at peace the best she can, whether it's big or small. In the Season 8 episode \"RIP: Rest in Payne\", she keeps complete faith for her son Calvin, when she hears that he got shot in C.J. and Janine's home. She loves her family and wants her husband to keep her safe and stand by her which he does.\n  * **Clarence James (C.J.) Payne, Jr. ([Allen Payne](/wiki/Allen_Payne \"Allen Payne\"))** is Curtis and Ella's nephew. C.J. and his family moved into the home of his Uncle Curtis and Aunt Ella when their own house burned down after his wife Janine accidentally started a fire while under the influence of drugs. C.J. is the father of Malik, Jazmine, Jayden, and Hayden Payne. These last two are the twin son and daughter born to Janine and C.J. after they reconciled and remarried. In the fourth season, C.J. found out he was adopted. He works at the firehouse with Curtis. At the end of the fifth season, he, Janine, and the twins moved to Chicago, but they returned in the sixth season after he was offered Curtis' job, and the family moved in next to Curtis and Ella. Despite being angry with and hostile towards Janine upon her return, C.J. never stopped loving her. In the early seasons, C.J. often has difficulty enforcing discipline with his children, but it is apparent that he is slightly more strict and hot-headed, often jumping to the wrong conclusions. In the Season 6 episode \"Who's Your Daddy Now?\", C.J. finally met his real father who happened to be white, making C.J. [biracial](/wiki/Biracial \"Biracial\"). In the seventh season, he was promoted to fire chief commissioner, and also became the boss of Janine and Roland in the public relations department. C.J. was portrayed as Curtis and Ella's son in the series' original format, but his character was changed to being their nephew.\n  * **Calvin Payne ([Lance Gross](/wiki/Lance_Gross \"Lance Gross\"))** is Ella and Curtis's college-age son who rarely attends the same courses Curtis often complains about financing. Calvin liked to think of himself as a player until he married Miranda. Like his cousin C.J., Calvin spends much time working with Curtis at the firehouse until he becomes a partner at the barbershop. In the fifth season, he gets a job working for the same company as Mercedes and she accidentally kisses him twice: once while they are chaperoning Malik and Alexandra's date; the other, after Calvin has a fight with Miranda. He finds out that he has a son, Calvin Jr., from his former girlfriend Tracy. He and Miranda are expecting a child when she decides they should separate, but they agree to try counseling. They get stuck in an elevator and solve their problems with help from an \"elevator lady\" Edi, who turns out to be Dr. Marcos, the marriage-retreat counselor. Calvin was arrested for back child support, but was bailed out of jail before the birth of his child with Miranda in the episode _Payneful Resolution Resolution_.\n\n    In the seventh season, Calvin briefly had a job as a manager of a supermarket. He then started working in the public relations department with C.J., Janine and Roland in Season 8. Calvin is the only main character who was originally not included in the show. In the season 8 episode \"God Bless the Paynes\", Calvin gets shot by a man who had harassed Miranda. The man saw the shooting as a way to get revenge at Calvin for beating him up. Calvin is later found by Janine and is rushed to the hospital in \"Do or Die\". He survives, but with serious injuries. In the series finale, \"All's Well\", his wife, Miranda, demands a divorce. The very last scene shows Calvin throwing a vase of flowers at the wall, and the series ends with the camera zoomed in on broken glass and rose petals.\n\n  * **Malik Payne ([Larramie \"Doc\" Shaw](/wiki/Larramie_%22Doc%22_Shaw \"Larramie \"Doc\" Shaw\"))** is C.J. and Janine's college-aged son. He is a young adult whose interest in young women in his class is so extreme that he'll resort to desperate measures, such as trying out for the cheerleading squad, just to associate with them. Initially, he was often bullied in school as a result of his mother's drug problems. As a result, he is reluctant to welcome her back to the household. It is hinted that he is allergic to peanuts and knows how to cut hair. Beginning with the sixth season, Malik has appeared infrequently, due to Larramie Shaw's work schedule, as he also starred on _[The Suite Life on Deck](/wiki/The_Suite_Life_on_Deck \"The Suite Life on Deck\")_ on [Disney Channel](/wiki/Disney_Channel \"Disney Channel\") and _[Pair of Kings](/wiki/Pair_of_Kings \"Pair of Kings\")_ on [Disney XD](/wiki/Disney_XD \"Disney XD\"). His absence is incorporated into the storyline, as he goes to the [ROTC](/wiki/ROTC \"ROTC\") during Season 6 and off to college during Season 7, which is a major continuity error as he advanced from elementary school to college in 4 years. As he prepared to go to college, C.J., Calvin, Curtis, and Floyd bought him three boxes of condoms because they were sure he would be experimenting with sex in college. His sister Jazmine was upset about him leaving for college. While in college, he dates a girl named Summer (Makeda Declet). Malik then marries Summer just that they can have sex. Summer then wants a divorce from Malik to transfer to a college in New England. But since Malik and Summer have only been married for a few weeks, they are qualified for an [annulment](/wiki/Annulment \"Annulment\") and that's how their marriage ended.**(Episodes 1-239)**\n  * **Jazmine Payne ([China Anne McClain](/wiki/China_Anne_McClain \"China Anne McClain\"))** is C.J. and Janine's daughter. She constantly feels invisible and acts out to get her father's attention while her mother is in rehab. At one point, Jazmine had a brief crush on Malik's friend Kevin. Despite her apparent innocence and youth, throughout the series, she was known to act cruel and mean toward Malik and Kevin and schemed to make them miserable. She is also known to have sarcastic comments and sly plans to get what she wants. For undisclosed reasons, China Anne McClain was written out of the series during the fifth season, which made her the only cast member to not appear in Season 5. She was re-introduced into the series when she returned in the sixth season. It is hinted that she has a fear of mimes that wear hats. On the premiere of the seventh season, she is 12 years old, and Janine lets her wear lip gloss, and she falls in with the wrong crowd. Jazmine has made infrequent appearances since the seventh season, due to China Anne McClain's work schedule, as she also starred in _[A.N.T. Farm](/wiki/A.N.T._Farm \"A.N.T. Farm\")_ on Disney Channel. **(Seasons 1–4, Episodes 127-249)**\n  * **Janine Payne (née Janine Shelton) ([Demetria McKinney](/wiki/Demetria_McKinney \"Demetria McKinney\"))**, is C.J.'s wife and the mother of Malik, Jazmine, Jayden, and Hayden Payne. A seemingly responsible adult and mother at the very beginning of the series, she is later revealed to be a drug addict and the arsonist who burned down her and C.J.'s home. She and C.J. divorce after she leaves her family. Initially, she was only a recurring character and was rarely seen in the series except in episodes where she associates with Ella Payne, who helps her enter a rehab program and return to the family. Later in the series, she is often criticized by C.J., Curtis, and Malik for her irresponsible actions. She is apparently impregnated by her boyfriend, until an episode reveals that he's sterile. Since C.J. is the only other person, she has had intercourse with (in an earlier episode, where they were intimate when C.J. was drunk), she realizes that C.J. is the father of the coming child. C.J. and Janine remarry at Calvin and Miranda's wedding; almost immediately, her water breaks and she gives birth to twins Jayden and Hayden Payne. Janine's parents are Larry and Liz Shelton. She and C.J. now live in their own home with their four children. In seasons 6-7, her role in the series has grown more central as she focuses more on her career than her home life—and becomes the target of romantic interest from her boss Roland until C.J. gets promoted to commissioner and becomes both Janine and Roland's boss and makes them keep their relationship professional. From that point on, C.J. and Janine both have the same job together and are able focus on both their career and home life together.\n  * **Miranda Payne (née Miranda Lucas) ([Keshia Knight Pulliam](/wiki/Keshia_Knight_Pulliam \"Keshia Knight Pulliam\"))** is Calvin's girlfriend-turned-wife. She was first introduced in Season 1 as a con artist who stole all of Calvin and Curtis' money for an art gallery. The character returned eventually, but what she did to Calvin and Curtis is only very briefly mentioned. She and Calvin married in the Season 4 conclusion. Miranda has a very troubled and bratty nephew; when Calvin was supposed to be in charge of the boy, it was actually the boy who ordered Calvin around. Miranda and Calvin began to have problems in the fifth season. In the beginning of the sixth season, a pregnant Miranda disappears; a couple of episodes later, Miranda says there is no baby, making Calvin believe she had an abortion, but she didn't. She is actually thinking about giving the baby up for adoption. Then, while all three couples (C.J and Janine, Curtis and Ella, Calvin and Miranda) go to a marriage retreat, Miranda asks Calvin for a divorce. But when she and Calvin go to a divorce mediator and get stuck in an elevator, they resolve their marriage problems with help from an \"elevator lady\" Edi who turns out to be Dr. Marcos, the marriage-retreat counselor. Calvin and Miranda had their baby in Season 7.\n\n    In the series finale \"All's Well', Janine, Miranda, CJ, and Calivin celebrate their wedding anniversary, but Miranda and Calvin never show up. Then Calvin shows up at the Payne House to take Miranda to the anniversary dinner, with a dress and a vase of roses. She interrupts him, and demands a divorce, saying that she'd been waiting for the right moment to tell him, but couldn't find one. The very last scene shows Calvin throwing the vase of roses at the wall, and it shatters. The series ends with the camera zoomed in on the broken glass and rose petals. **(Seasons 3-8, guest star in Season 1)**\n\n  * **Claretha Jenkins ([Denise Burse](/wiki/Denise_Burse \"Denise Burse\"))** is Ella's friend and the Paynes' former next-door neighbor. Curtis constantly jokes about her annoyance at his presence. Claretha has a big mouth; she even rats out the family business to the media in a crime misconception.

When the series debuted on [TBS](/wiki/TBS_\\(TV_network\\) \"TBS\n\\(TV network\\)\") in June 2007, Perry made a guest appearance as Madea. Actor\n[David Mann](/wiki/David_Mann_\\(actor\\) \"David Mann \\(actor\\)\") reprised his\nMr. Brown role, and [Keke Palmer](/wiki/Keke_Palmer \"Keke Palmer\") returned as\nNikki, a [bully](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bully \"wikt:bully\") who stole\n$20 worth of Malik's lunch money over a period of time, money which Madea,\nNikki's foster mother, used at a [casino](/wiki/Casino \"Casino\"). Perry\nreturned as Madea for a Christmas episode of the show on December 5, 2007.\nPerry again returned as Madea to act as Curtis's wife on March 5, 2008. She\nhas appeared in one episode every season, save seasons 4 and 5. She is one of\nCurtis' arch enemies.\n\nIn the series, Janine's drug problem and going to rehab are possible\nreferences to _[Diary of a Mad Black Woman](/wiki/Diary_of_a_Mad_Black_Woman\n\"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\")_. The events of the episodes \"Sad, Sad, Leroy\nBrown\" parts 1 and 2 came directly before the movie [_Meet the\nBrowns_](/wiki/Meet_the_Browns_\\(film\\) \"Meet the Browns \\(film\\)\"), when\nBrown learns his father has died. The events of the episode \"Weeping May\nEndure for a Night\" happened somewhere in the middle, directly after the\nfuneral and the reading of the will, where Brown found out that his father\nleft him a broken-down house which Brown turned into a retirement home. Even\nthough in the episode \"Weeping May Endure for a Night\", the Paynes claim to\nhave attended the funeral of Brown's father, in _Meet the Browns_ , they are\nnowhere to be seen. This may be because Lance Gross, who plays Calvin Payne in\nthe series, plays a character named Michael in the film and LaVan Davis, who\nplays Curtis Payne, plays a bus driver. Curtis claimed Brown made them wait in\nthe cemetery for two hours while he gave his father a tour of Atlanta (his\nlast request), but in the movie, Brown stayed the entire time. The episodes\nserve as a [backdoor pilot](/wiki/Backdoor_pilot \"Backdoor pilot\") to _[Tyler\nPerry's Meet the Browns](/wiki/Meet_the_Browns_\\(TV_series\\) \"Meet the Browns\n\\(TV series\\)\")_, a spin-off of the film and play as well as _House of Payne_.\n\n### _Meet the Browns_\ncrossovers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Meet the Browns crossovers\")]\n\nThere have been crossovers on _House of Payne_ from _[Meet the\nBrowns](/wiki/Meet_the_Browns_\\(TV_series\\) \"Meet the Browns \\(TV series\\)\")_\n:\n\n  * In the episode \"I Can Cry If I Want To\", Brown attended Curtis's 50th birthday party and stresses the Paynes out while he is there.\n  * In the episode \"Sad, Sad, Leroy Brown (Part 1)\", when Brown's house burnt down and he gets kicked out of Cora's best friend's house. He stays at the Paynes' residence, much to Curtis's dismay and soon becomes a pestering houseguest.\n  * In the episode \"Sad, Sad, Leroy Brown (Part 2)\", when the Paynes tries to kick Brown out of the house, Brown claimed that Curtis broke his back, but Curtis knows the truth that Brown's back was not in pain, and he only faked it to get the Paynes to let him stay with them. However, Ella believes Brown and insisted on him staying with them until his back gets better.\n  * In the episode \"Weeping May Endure for a Night\", Brown, Cora, and Will come by the Paynes' residence after Pop Brown's funeral. Brown is upset because Pop Brown left him a run-down house which makes Brown think his daddy hates him until he realizes that Pop Brown wanted him to open up a retirement home.\n  * In the episode \"Meet the Christmas Spirit\" (Meet the Browns), Curtis and Ella Payne drop in for a visit at the hospital to put on a play for the children.\n  * In the episode \"Oh Christmas Payne\", Brown and Cora drop in for a visit.\n  * In the episodes \"What You Know About Me\" and \"Payneful Divorce\", Cora's former high school student, Milo Jackson, attended the same college as Malik.\n\n##\nReleases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tyler_Perry%27s_House_of_Payne&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Releases\")]\n\n[Lionsgate Home Entertainment](/wiki/Lionsgate_Home_Entertainment \"Lionsgate\nHome Entertainment\") has released the first 10 volumes on DVD in Region 1.
