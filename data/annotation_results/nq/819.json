The Cowboys' streak of 190 consecutive sold-out regular\nand post-season games (home and away) began in 2002.[7] The franchise has made\nit to the Super Bowl eight times, tied with the [Pittsburgh\nSteelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") and the [Denver\nBroncos](/wiki/Denver_Broncos \"Denver Broncos\") for second most Super Bowl\nappearances in history, just behind the [New England\nPatriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\") record ten Super\nBowl appearances.

This infuriated Murchison and he called off the\ndeal. Marshall then opposed any franchise for Murchison in Dallas. Since NFL\nexpansion needed unanimous approval from team owners at that time, Marshall's\nposition would prevent Murchison from joining the league.\n\nMarshall had a falling out with the Redskins band leader Barnee Breeskin.\nBreeskin had written the music to the Redskins fight song \"[Hail to the\nRedskins](/wiki/Hail_to_the_Redskins \"Hail to the Redskins\")\" and Marshall's\nwife had penned the lyrics. Breeskin owned the rights to the song and was\naware of Murchison's plight to get an NFL franchise. Angry with Marshall,\nBreeskin approached Murchison's attorney to sell him the rights to the song\nbefore the expansion vote in 1959. Murchison purchased \"Hail to the Redskins\"\nfor $2,500. Before the vote to award franchises in 1959, Murchison revealed to\nMarshall that he owned the song and Marshall could not play it during games.\nAfter a few Marshall expletives, Murchison gave the rights to \"Hail to the\nRedskins\" to Marshall for his vote, the lone one against Murchison getting a\nfranchise at that time, and a [rivalry](/wiki/Cowboys%E2%80%93Redskins_rivalry\n\"Cowboys–Redskins rivalry\") was born.\n\n### 1970s\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/1986_Jeno%27s_Pizza_-_01_-_Duane_Thomas.jpg)](/wiki/File:1986_Jeno%27s_Pizza_-_01_-_Duane_Thomas.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1986_Jeno%27s_Pizza_-_01_-_Duane_Thomas.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Cowboys playing against the Dolphins in [Super Bowl\nVI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_VI \"Super Bowl VI\").\n\nFrom [1970](/wiki/1970_NFL_season \"1970 NFL season\") through\n[1979](/wiki/1979_NFL_season \"1979 NFL season\"), the Cowboys won 105 regular\nseason games, more than any other NFL franchise during that span.[10] In\naddition, they appeared in 5 and won two [Super Bowls](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super\nBowl\"), at the end of the [1971](/wiki/1971_NFL_season \"1971 NFL season\") and\n[1977](/wiki/1977_NFL_season \"1977 NFL season\") regular seasons.\n\n### 1980s\n\n[Danny White](/wiki/Danny_White \"Danny White\") became the Cowboys' starting\nquarterback in 1980 after quarterback [Roger Staubach](/wiki/Roger_Staubach\n\"Roger Staubach\") retired. Despite going to 12–4 in\n[1980](/wiki/1980_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1980 Dallas Cowboys season\"), the\nCowboys came into the playoffs as a Wild Card team. In the opening round of\nthe [1980–81 NFL playoffs](/wiki/1980%E2%80%9381_NFL_playoffs \"1980–81 NFL\nplayoffs\") they avenged their elimination from the prior year's playoffs by\ndefeating the Rams. In the Divisional Round they squeaked by the [Atlanta\nFalcons](/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons \"Atlanta Falcons\") 30–27. For the NFC\nChampionship they were pitted against division rival Philadelphia, the team\nthat won the division during the regular season. The Eagles captured their\nfirst conference championship and Super Bowl berth by winning 20–7.\n\n[1981](/wiki/1981_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1981 Dallas Cowboys season\") brought\nanother division championship for the Cowboys.

With a 6–3 record Dallas made it\nto the playoffs for the 8th consecutive season. As the number 2 seed for the\n[1982–83 NFL playoffs](/wiki/1982%E2%80%9383_NFL_playoffs \"1982–83 NFL\nplayoffs\") they eliminated the Buccaneers 30–17 in the Wild Card round and\ndispatched the Packers 37–26 in the Divisional round to advance to their 3rd\nconsecutive Conference championship game. 3 times was not a charm for the\nCowboys as they fell 31–17 to division rival and eventual [Super Bowl\nXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XVII \"Super Bowl XVII\") champions Redskins.\n\nFor the [1983 season](/wiki/1983_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1983 Dallas Cowboys\nseason\") the Cowboys went 12–4 and made it once again to the playoffs but were\ndefeated at home in the Wild Card by the Rams 24–17.

After going 10–6 in [1985](/wiki/1985_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1985\nDallas Cowboys season\") and winning a division title, the Cowboys were blown\nout in the Divisional round at home to the Rams 20–0.\n\nHard times came for the organization as they went 7–9 in\n[1986](/wiki/1986_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1986 Dallas Cowboys season\"), 7–8 in\n[1987](/wiki/1987_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1987 Dallas Cowboys season\"), and\n3–13 in [1988](/wiki/1988_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1988 Dallas Cowboys season\").\nDuring this time period Bright became disenchanted with the team. During the\n[Savings and Loan crisis](/wiki/Savings_and_Loan_crisis \"Savings and Loan\ncrisis\"), the team and Mr. Bright's Savings and Loan were taken over by the\n[FSLIC](/wiki/Federal_Savings_and_Loan_Insurance_Corporation \"Federal Savings\nand Loan Insurance Corporation\"). During an embarrassing home loss to Atlanta\nin 1987, Bright told the media that he was \"horrified\" at coach [Tom\nLandry](/wiki/Tom_Landry \"Tom Landry\")'s play calling. The FSLIC forced Mr.\nBright to sell the Cowboys to [Jerry Jones](/wiki/Jerry_Jones \"Jerry Jones\")\non February 25, 1989.\n\nJones immediately fired Tom Landry, the only head coach in franchise history,\nreplacing him with [University of Miami](/wiki/University_of_Miami \"University\nof Miami\") head coach [Jimmy\nJohnson](/wiki/Jimmy_Johnson_\\(American_football_coach\\) \"Jimmy Johnson\n\\(American football coach\\)\"), who was also Jerry Jones' teammate in\n[University of Arkansas](/wiki/University_of_Arkansas \"University of\nArkansas\") as a fellow defensive lineman and Michael Irvin was under his\ntutelage in college.

The\nyoung talent joined holdovers from the Landry era such as wide receiver\n[Michael Irvin](/wiki/Michael_Irvin \"Michael Irvin\"), guard [Nate\nNewton](/wiki/Nate_Newton \"Nate Newton\"), linebacker [Ken Norton\nJr.](/wiki/Ken_Norton_Jr. \"Ken Norton Jr.\"), and offensive lineman [Mark\nTuinei](/wiki/Mark_Tuinei \"Mark Tuinei\"), defensive lineman [Jim\nJeffcoat](/wiki/Jim_Jeffcoat \"Jim Jeffcoat\"), and veteran pickups such as\ntight end [Jay Novacek](/wiki/Jay_Novacek \"Jay Novacek\") and defensive end\n[Charles Haley](/wiki/Charles_Haley \"Charles Haley\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Texas_Stadium_-\n_Dallas_Cowboys_World_Champions_Mural.JPG/250px-Texas_Stadium_-\n_Dallas_Cowboys_World_Champions_Mural.JPG)](/wiki/File:Texas_Stadium_-\n_Dallas_Cowboys_World_Champions_Mural.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Texas_Stadium_-_Dallas_Cowboys_World_Champions_Mural.JPG\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nFive-time World Champions Mural\n\nThings started to look up for the franchise in\n[1990](/wiki/1990_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1990 Dallas Cowboys season\"). On Week\n1 Dallas won their first home game since September 1988 when they defeated the\n[San Diego Chargers](/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers \"San Diego Chargers\") 17–14.\nThey went 2–7 in their next 9 games but won 4 of their last 6 games to finish\nthe season with a 4th place 7–9 record.\n\nComing into [1991](/wiki/1991_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1991 Dallas Cowboys\nseason\") the Cowboys replaced offensive coordinator [Dave\nShula](/wiki/Dave_Shula \"Dave Shula\") with [Norv Turner](/wiki/Norv_Turner\n\"Norv Turner\"); the Cowboys raced to a 6–5 start, then defeated the\npreviously-unbeaten [Redskins](/wiki/1991_Washington_Redskins_season \"1991\nWashington Redskins season\") despite injury to [Troy Aikman](/wiki/Troy_Aikman\n\"Troy Aikman\"). Backup [Steve Beuerlein](/wiki/Steve_Beuerlein \"Steve\nBeuerlein\") took over and the Cowboys finished 11–5. In the Wild Card round\nthey defeated the [Bears](/wiki/1991_Chicago_Bears_season \"1991 Chicago Bears\nseason\") 17–13 for the Cowboys first playoff win since 1982. In the Divisional\nround their season ended in a 38–6 playoff rout by the\n[Lions](/wiki/1991_Detroit_Lions_season \"1991 Detroit Lions season\").\n\nIn [1992](/wiki/1992_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1992 Dallas Cowboys season\")\nDallas set a team record for regular season wins with a 13–3 mark. They\nstarted off the season by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion Redskins\n23–10. Going into the playoffs as the number 2 seed they had a first round bye\nbefore facing division rival the Philadelphia Eagles. The Cowboys won that\ngame 34–10 to advance to the NFC Conference Championship game for the first\ntime in 10 years. They were pitted against the San Francisco 49ers, the number\n1 seed. On January 17, 1993 the Cowboys went to [Candlestick\nPark](/wiki/Candlestick_Park \"Candlestick Park\") and defeated the 49ers 30–20\nto clinch their first Super Bowl berth since 1978. Dallas defeated the\n[Buffalo Bills](/wiki/Buffalo_Bills \"Buffalo Bills\") 52–17 in [Super Bowl\nXXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXVII \"Super Bowl XXVII\"), during which they forced a\nrecord nine turnovers. Johnson became the first coach to claim a national\nchampionship in college football and a Super Bowl victory in professional\nfootball.\n\nDespite starting the [1993](/wiki/1993_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1993 Dallas\nCowboys season\") season 0–2, they again defeated the Buffalo Bills in [Super\nBowl XXVIII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXVIII \"Super Bowl XXVIII\"), 30–13 (becoming the\nfirst team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl after starting 0–2). Dallas\nfinished the regular season 12–4 as the number 1 seed of the NFC. They\ndefeated the Green Bay Packers 27–17 in the divisional round. In the NFC\nConference Championship, Dallas beat the 49ers in Dallas, 38–21. Dallas sent a\nthen-NFL record 11 players to the Pro Bowl in 1993: Aikman, safety [Thomas\nEverett](/wiki/Thomas_Everett \"Thomas Everett\"), Irvin, Johnston, Maryland,\nNewton, Norton, Novacek, Smith, Stepnoski and Williams.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Dallas_Cowboys_stadium_championship_banners_4.JPG/220px-\nDallas_Cowboys_stadium_championship_banners_4.JPG)](/wiki/File:Dallas_Cowboys_stadium_championship_banners_4.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dallas_Cowboys_stadium_championship_banners_4.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nDallas Cowboys championship banners inside AT&T Stadium\n\nOnly weeks after Super Bowl XXVIII, however, friction between Johnson and\nJones culminated in Johnson stunning the football world by announcing his\nresignation. Jones then hired former [University of\nOklahoma](/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma \"University of Oklahoma\") head coach\n[Barry Switzer](/wiki/Barry_Switzer \"Barry Switzer\") to replace Johnson. The\nCowboys finished 12–4 in [1994](/wiki/1994_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1994 Dallas\nCowboys season\"). They once again clinched a first round bye and defeated\nGreen Bay 35–9 in the Divisional Round. They missed the Super Bowl, however,\nafter losing to the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, 38–28.\n\nPrior to the start of [1995 season](/wiki/1995_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1995\nDallas Cowboys season\") Jerry Jones lured All-Pro cornerback [Deion\nSanders](/wiki/Deion_Sanders \"Deion Sanders\") away from San Francisco. Dallas\nstarted the season 4–0 including shutting out their division rival New York\nGiants 35–0 at [Giants Stadium](/wiki/Giants_Stadium \"Giants Stadium\") to open\ntheir season. Emmitt Smith set an NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns that\nseason. They ended the season 12–4 and went into the playoffs as the number 1\nseed. In the Divisional round they dispatched their division rival Eagles\n30–11 to advance to their 4th consecutive NFC Conference Championship Game, in\nwhich they defeated Green Bay, 38–27. In [Super Bowl XXX](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXX\n\"Super Bowl XXX\") the Cowboys defeated the [Pittsburgh\nSteelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") 27–17 at [Sun Devil\nStadium](/wiki/Sun_Devil_Stadium \"Sun Devil Stadium\") for their fifth Super\nBowl championship. Switzer joined Johnson as the only coaches to win a college\nfootball national championship and a Super Bowl.\n\nThe glory days of the Cowboys were again beginning to dim as free agency, age,\nand injuries began taking their toll. Star receiver Michael Irvin was\nsuspended by the league for the first five games of\n[1996](/wiki/1996_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1996 Dallas Cowboys season\")\nfollowing a drug-related arrest; he came back after the Cowboys started the\nseason 2–3. They finished the regular season with a 10–6 record, won the [NFC\nEast](/wiki/NFC_East \"NFC East\") title, and entered the playoffs as the number\n3 seed in the NFC. They defeated Minnesota 40–15 in the Wild Card round but\nwere eliminated in the Divisional round of the playoffs 26–17 by the [Carolina\nPanthers](/wiki/1996_Carolina_Panthers_season \"1996 Carolina Panthers\nseason\").\n\nThe Cowboys went 6–10 in [1997](/wiki/1997_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1997 Dallas\nCowboys season\") (including losing their last 6 games of the season), with\ndiscipline and off-field problems becoming major distractions.[12] As a\nresult, Switzer resigned as head coach in January 1998 and former Steelers\noffensive coordinator [Chan Gailey](/wiki/Chan_Gailey \"Chan Gailey\") was hired\nto take his place.\n\nGailey led the team to two playoff appearances with a 10–6 record in\n[1998](/wiki/1998_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1998 Dallas Cowboys season\") and an\n[NFC East](/wiki/NFC_East \"NFC East\") championship, but the Cowboys were\ndefeated in the playoffs by the [Arizona Cardinals](/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals\n\"Arizona Cardinals\") 20–7.\n\nIn [1999](/wiki/1999_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1999 Dallas Cowboys season\")\nDallas went 8–8 (during which Irvin suffered a career-ending spinal injury in\na loss to the [Philadelphia Eagles](/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles \"Philadelphia\nEagles\")) ending in another playoff loss (this time to the [Minnesota\nVikings](/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings \"Minnesota Vikings\") 27–10). Gailey was fired\nand became the first Cowboys coach who did not take the team to a Super Bowl.\n\n### 2000–09\n\nDefensive coordinator [Dave Campo](/wiki/Dave_Campo \"Dave Campo\") was promoted\nto head coach for the [2000 season](/wiki/2000_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2000\nDallas Cowboys season\"). Prior to the season starting cornerback [Deion\nSanders](/wiki/Deion_Sanders \"Deion Sanders\") was released after 5 seasons\nwith the team. He later signed with division rival Washington. In Week 1, they\nwere blown out 41–14 by Philadelphia. That game was very costly when veteran\nquarterback Troy Aikman suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended\nhis career. Longtime NFL QB [Randall Cunningham](/wiki/Randall_Cunningham\n\"Randall Cunningham\") filled in for Aikman for the rest of the season at QB.\nThe Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5–11 record. The only\nhighlights of 2000 were Emmitt Smith having his 10th consecutive 1,000 yard\nrushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins.\n\n[2001](/wiki/2001_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2001 Dallas Cowboys season\") was\nanother hard year in Dallas. Prior to the season starting Aikman was released\nfrom the team and he retired due to the concussions he had received. Jerry\nJones signed [Tony Banks](/wiki/Tony_Banks_\\(American_football\\) \"Tony Banks\n\\(American football\\)\") as a QB. Banks had been a starter for half of the\nseason the previous year for the Super Bowl Champion [Baltimore\nRavens](/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens \"Baltimore Ravens\") before being benched. Jones\nalso drafted QB [Quincy Carter](/wiki/Quincy_Carter \"Quincy Carter\") in the\nsecond round of that year's draft, but Banks was released during the\npreseason. [Ryan Leaf](/wiki/Ryan_Leaf \"Ryan Leaf\"), [Anthony\nWright](/wiki/Anthony_Wright_\\(American_football\\) \"Anthony Wright \\(American\nfootball\\)\"), and [Clint Stoerner](/wiki/Clint_Stoerner \"Clint Stoerner\") all\ncompeted for the quarterback position that season. Dallas again finished at\n5–11, last place in the NFC East. They did sweep the Redskins for the 4th\nconsecutive season.\n\nPrior to the [2002 season](/wiki/2002_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2002 Dallas\nCowboys season\") Dallas drafted safety [Roy\nWilliams](/wiki/Roy_Williams_\\(safety\\) \"Roy Williams \\(safety\\)\") with the\n8th overall pick. The season started out low as the Cowboys lost to the\n[expansion](/wiki/Expansion_team \"Expansion team\") [Houston\nTexans](/wiki/Houston_Texans \"Houston Texans\") 19–10 on Week 1. By far the\nhighlight of 2002 was on October 28, when during a home game against the\n[Seattle Seahawks](/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks \"Seattle Seahawks\"), Emmitt Smith\nbroke the all-time NFL rushing record previously held by [Walter\nPayton](/wiki/Walter_Payton \"Walter Payton\"). Their Thanksgiving Day win over\nthe Redskins was their 10th consecutive win against Washington. However, that\nwas their final win of 2002: Dallas lost their next 4 games to finish with\nanother last place 5–11 record. The losing streak was punctuated with a Week\n17 20–14 loss against Washington. That game was Smith's last game as a Cowboys\nplayer: he was released during the offseason. Campo was immediately fired as\nhead coach at the conclusion of the season.\n\nJones then lured [Bill Parcells](/wiki/Bill_Parcells \"Bill Parcells\") out of\nretirement to coach the Cowboys. The Cowboys became the surprise team of the\n[2003 season](/wiki/2003_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2003 Dallas Cowboys season\")\ngetting off to a hot 7–2 season, but went 3–4 for the rest of the season. They\nwere able to win the division with a 10–6 record but lost in the Wild Card\nround to eventual conference champion Carolina Panthers 29–10.\n\nIn [2004](/wiki/2004_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2004 Dallas Cowboys season\")\nDallas was unable to replicate their 2003 success, and ended 6–10. Quincy\nCarter was released during the preseason and was replaced at QB by [Vinny\nTestaverde](/wiki/Vinny_Testaverde \"Vinny Testaverde\").\n\nDallas got off to a hot 7–3 start for the [2005\nseason](/wiki/2005_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2005 Dallas Cowboys season\") but\nended the season in 3rd place with a 9–7 record. Prior to the season starting\nthe Cowboys signed veteran [Drew Bledsoe](/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe \"Drew Bledsoe\")\nas a quarterback.\n\n[2006](/wiki/2006_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2006 Dallas Cowboys season\") was an\ninteresting year for the Cowboys. Prior to the season Dallas signed free agent\nwide receiver [Terrell Owens](/wiki/Terrell_Owens \"Terrell Owens\") who was\ntalented yet controversial. The Cowboys started the season 3–2. During a week\n7 matchup against the Giants, Bledsoe, who had been struggling since the start\nof the season, was pulled from the game and was replaced by backup [Tony\nRomo](/wiki/Tony_Romo \"Tony Romo\"). Romo was unable to salvage that game and\nDallas lost 38–22. However, Romo was named the starter for team and went 5–1\nin his first 6 games. Dallas ended the season with a 9–7 2nd-place finish.\nThey were able to clinch the number 5 playoff seed. They traveled to play\nSeattle where the Seahawks won 21–20. After the season Parcells retired and\nwas replaced as head coach by [Wade Phillips](/wiki/Wade_Phillips \"Wade\nPhillips\").[13]\n\nDallas started off the [2007 season](/wiki/2007_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2007\nDallas Cowboys season\") with a bang. They began the season with a 12–1 start,\nincluding winning their first five games. Their only loss during that time\nspan came against [New England](/wiki/2007_New_England_Patriots_season \"2007\nNew England Patriots season\"), who went undefeated that season. Despite\ndropping two of their last three regular season games, the Cowboys clinched\ntheir first number 1 NFC seed in 12 years, which also granted them a first\nround bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. The Cowboys lost\nin the divisional round 21–17 to the eventual [Super\nBowl](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLII \"Super Bowl XLII\") champion [New York\nGiants](/wiki/2007_New_York_Giants_season \"2007 New York Giants season\").\n\nIn the tumultuous 2008 season, the Cowboys started off strong, going 3–0 for\nthe second straight year, en route to a 4–1 start. However, things soon went\ndownhill from there, after quarterback Tony Romo suffered a broken pinkie in\nan overtime loss to the [Arizona Cardinals](/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals \"Arizona\nCardinals\"). With [Brad Johnson](/wiki/Brad_Johnson_\\(American_football\\)\n\"Brad Johnson \\(American football\\)\") and [Brooks\nBollinger](/wiki/Brooks_Bollinger \"Brooks Bollinger\") playing as backups,\nDallas went 1–2 during a three-game stretch. Romo's return showed promise, as\nDallas went 3–0. However, injuries mounted during the season with the team\nlosing several starters for the year, such as [Kyle Kosier](/wiki/Kyle_Kosier\n\"Kyle Kosier\"), [Felix Jones](/wiki/Felix_Jones \"Felix Jones\"), safety [Roy\nWilliams](/wiki/Roy_Williams_\\(safety\\) \"Roy Williams \\(safety\\)\") and punter\n[Mat McBriar](/wiki/Mat_McBriar \"Mat McBriar\"), and several other starters\nplaying with injuries.[14] Entering December, the 8–4 Cowboys underperformed,\nfinishing 1–3. They failed to make the playoffs after losing at Philadelphia\nin the final regular season game which saw the Eagles reach the playoffs\ninstead.\n\nOn May 2, 2009, the Dallas Cowboys' practice facility collapsed during a wind\nstorm. The collapse left twelve Cowboys players and coaches injured. The most\nserious injuries were special teams coach [Joe\nDeCamillis](/wiki/Joe_DeCamillis \"Joe DeCamillis\"), who suffered fractured\ncervical vertebrae and had surgery to stabilize fractured vertebrae in his\nneck, and [Rich Behm](/wiki/Rich_Behm \"Rich Behm\"), the team's 33-year-old\nscouting assistant, who was permanently paralyzed from the waist down after\nhis spine was severed.\n\nThe 2009 season started on a positive with a road win against Tampa Bay, but\nfortunes quickly changed as Dallas fell to a 2–2 start. In week five, with\nstarting wide receiver Roy Williams sidelined by injury, receiver [Miles\nAustin](/wiki/Miles_Austin \"Miles Austin\") got his first start of the season\nand had a record setting day (250 yards receiving and 2 TDs) to help lead\nDallas to an overtime win over Kansas City. Following their [bye\nweek](/wiki/Bye_week \"Bye week\"), Dallas went on a three-game winning streak\nincluding wins over Atlanta and NFC East division rival Philadelphia. Despite\nentering December with a record of 8–3, Dallas lost its slim grip on 1st place\nin the division with losses to the New York Giants and San Diego. Talks of\npast December collapses resurfaced, and another collapse in 2009 seemed\nvalidated. However, the Dallas team surged in the final three weeks of the\nseason with a 24–17 victory at the Superdome, ending New Orleans' previously\nunbeaten season in week 15. For the first time in franchise history, Dallas\nposted back-to-back shutouts when they beat division rivals Washington (17–0)\nand Philadelphia (24–0) to end the season. In the process, the Cowboys\nclinched their second NFC East title in three years as well as the third seed\nin the NFC Playoffs. Six days later, in the wild-card round of the playoffs,\nDallas played the Eagles in a rematch of week 17. The Cowboys defeated the\nEagles for the first Cowboys' post-season win since the 1996 season, ending a\nstreak of six consecutive NFL post-season losses. Dallas ended their playoff\nrun after a hard divisional playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n### 2010–13\n\nAfter beginning the [2010 season](/wiki/2010_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2010\nDallas Cowboys season\") at 1–7, Phillips was fired as head coach and was\nreplaced by offensive coordinator [Jason Garrett](/wiki/Jason_Garrett \"Jason\nGarrett\") as the interim head coach.[15] The Cowboys finished the season 6–10.\n\nWith the 9th pick of the 1st round of the 2011 draft, the Cowboys selected\n[USC](/wiki/University_of_Southern_California \"University of Southern\nCalifornia\") tackle [Tyron Smith](/wiki/Tyron_Smith \"Tyron Smith\").\n\nTo start the [2011 season](/wiki/2011_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2011 Dallas\nCowboys season\") the Cowboys played the New York Jets on a Sunday night\nprimetime game in New York, on September 11, 2011. The Cowboys held the lead\nthrough most of the game, until a fumble, blocked punt, and interception led\nto the Jets coming back to win the game. In week 2 Dallas traveled to San\nFrancisco to play the 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the\nCowboys trailed 10–7, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by Jon\nKitna. Kitna threw 1 Touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the\n3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 17–7. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to\nMiles Austin as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime. On the\nCowboys opening possession after 49ers punt, Romo found WR Jesse Holley on a\n78-yard pass, which set up the game-winning field goal by rookie kicker Dan\nBailey.\n\nDallas ended the season 8–8. They were in a position to win the NFC East but\nlost to the Giants in a Week 17 primetime Sunday Night game on [NBC](/wiki/NBC\n\"NBC\") which allowed New York to win the division. The Giants would go on to\nwin [Super Bowl XLVI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVI \"Super Bowl XLVI\").\n\nThe Cowboys started off the [2012 season](/wiki/2012_Dallas_Cowboys_season\n\"2012 Dallas Cowboys season\") on a high note by defeating the defending Super\nBowl Champion New York Giants 24–17 on the opening night of the season. They\nwould hover around the .500 mark for the majority of the season. They lost a\nclose Week 6 game to eventual [Super Bowl XXVII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXVII \"Super\nBowl XXVII\") Champion Baltimore Ravens 31–29 at [M&T Bank\nStadium](/wiki/M%26T_Bank_Stadium \"M&T Bank Stadium\") in Baltimore.\n\nGoing into Week 17 they found themselves once again one win away from winning\nthe division. Standing in their way was the Redskins who had beat them on\nThanksgiving at [AT&T Stadium](/wiki/AT%26T_Stadium \"AT&T Stadium\") and whom\nwere also one win away from their first division title since 1999. Led by\n[Robert Griffin III](/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III \"Robert Griffin III\") the\nRedskins defeated the Cowboys at home 28-18. Dallas once again finished the\nseason 8–8.\n\nIn the [2013 season](/wiki/2013_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2013 Dallas Cowboys\nseason\") Dallas started off by defeating the Giants for the second straight\nyear this time 36–31. It was the first time since [AT&T\nStadium](/wiki/AT%26T_Stadium \"AT&T Stadium\") had opened back in 2009 that the\nCowboys were able to defeat New York at home. The win was punctuated by\n[Brandon Carr](/wiki/Brandon_Carr \"Brandon Carr\") returning an [Eli\nManning](/wiki/Eli_Manning \"Eli Manning\") interception to a touchdown late in\nthe 4th quarter.\n\nFor the third straight year Dallas once again found themselves stuck in the\n.500 area. In Week 5, they lost a shootout to eventual AFC Champion Denver\nBroncos 51–48. They battled it out with Philadelphia for control of the\ndivision throughout the season. In December however they lost 2 crucial back\nto back games to Chicago and Green Bay. They were very successful in division\ngames having a 5–0 division record heading into another Week 17 showdown for\nthe NFC East crown against the Eagles. That included beating Washington 24–23\non Week 16 thanks to late game heroics of [Tony Romo](/wiki/Tony_Romo \"Tony\nRomo\"). However Romo received a severe back injury in that game which\nprematurely ended his season. The Cowboys called upon backup QB [Kyle\nOrton](/wiki/Kyle_Orton \"Kyle Orton\") to lead them into battle on the final\nweek of the season. Orton was unsuccessful who threw a game ending\ninterception to the Eagles which allowed Philly to win 24–22. Dallas ended the\nyear at 8–8 for the third year in a row. The only difference of this 8–8\nending compared to the others was that Dallas ended the season in second place\ncompared to the 2 previous 3rd-place finishes.\n\n### 2014\n\nMain article: [2014 Dallas Cowboys season](/wiki/2014_Dallas_Cowboys_season\n\"2014 Dallas Cowboys season\")\n\nTo start off the [2014 season](/wiki/2014_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"2014 Dallas\nCowboys season\") Dallas began by losing to San Francisco 28–17. After that\nthey went on a 6-game winning streak. The highlight of this streak was\ndefeating the Seahawks at [CenturyLink Field](/wiki/CenturyLink_Field\n\"CenturyLink Field\") 30–23. In Week 8, the Redskins won in overtime 20–17, and\nRomo's back became once again injured. He missed next week, a home loss to the\nArizona Cardinals 28–17 with backup QB [Brandon Weeden](/wiki/Brandon_Weeden\n\"Brandon Weeden\"). Romo returned in Week 9 to lead a 31–17 victory of the\n[Jacksonville Jaguars](/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars \"Jacksonville Jaguars\")\nwhich was played at [Wembley Stadium](/wiki/Wembley_Stadium \"Wembley Stadium\")\nin [London, England](/wiki/London,_England \"London, England\") as part of the\n[NFL International Series](/wiki/NFL_International_Series \"NFL International\nSeries\").\n\nDallas played into their traditional Thanksgiving home game, this time against\ndivision rival Philadelphia. Both teams were vying for first place in the\ndivision with identical 8–3 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and\nthe Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33–10. They would rebound the next\nweek where on the road Thursday night game they defeated Chicago 41–28 for\ntheir 9th win of the year to clinch their first winning season since 2009.\nThis was the first time that Dallas played on back to back Thursdays. Week 15\nwas a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who\ngot off to a fast start going up 21–0. Then the Eagles put up 24 answered\npoints but Dallas came back to win 38–27 to go into first place for the first\ntime in the season and improve to 10–4. Going into their Week 16 matchup at\nhome against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first\ndivision title since 2009 by defeating the Colts thanks to the Eagles losing\nthat week to the Redskins. They would not disappoint as they blew out the\nColts 42–7 to become the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from\nthe playoffs. Dallas would end the regular season with a 12–4 record and an\n8–0 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44–17. They would\nalso finish December 4–0 which was huge for the Cowboys since they had\nstruggled in the recent years in the month of December.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, the Cowboys, as the number 3 seed, hosted the number 6\nseed [Detroit Lions](/wiki/Detroit_Lions \"Detroit Lions\") in the wild card\nround of the [NFL playoffs](/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_NFL_playoffs \"2014–15 NFL\nplayoffs\"). In the game, the Lions got off to a hot start, going up 14–0 in\nthe first quarter. Dallas initially struggled on both sides of the ball.\nHowever, towards the end of the second quarter Romo threw a 76-yard touchdown\npass to Terrance Williams. [Matt Prater](/wiki/Matt_Prater \"Matt Prater\") of\nthe Lions would kick a field goal before halftime to go up 17–7. Dallas came\nout swinging to start the second half by picking off Detroit quarterback\n[Matthew Stafford](/wiki/Matthew_Stafford \"Matthew Stafford\") on the first\nplay of the third quarter. However, the Cowboys failed to capitalize on the\nturnover, as Dan Bailey missed a field goal during Dallas's ensuing drive.\nDetroit then kicked another field goal to make the score 20–7. A DeMarco\nMurray touchdown later in that quarter closed the gap to 20–14. A 51-yard\nBailey field goal almost 3 minutes into the fourth quarter trimmed the\nCowboys' deficit to 3. The Lions got the ball back and started driving down\nthe field. On 3rd down-and-1 of that Lions drive, Stafford threw a 17-yard\npass intended for Lions tight end [Brandon Pettigrew](/wiki/Brandon_Pettigrew\n\"Brandon Pettigrew\"), but the ball hit Cowboys linebacker [Anthony\nHitchens](/wiki/Anthony_Hitchens \"Anthony Hitchens\") in the back a fraction of\na second before he ran into Pettigrew. The play was initially flagged as\ndefensive pass interference against Hitchens. However, the penalty was then\nnullified by the officiating crew. The Cowboys got the ball back on their\n41-yard line and had a successful 59-yard drive which was capped off by an\n8-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Williams to give the Cowboys their first\nlead of the game at 24–20. The Lions got the ball back with less than 2:30 to\nplay in regulation. Stafford fumbled the ball at the 2 minute mark. The fumble\nwas recovered by Cowboys defensive end [DeMarcus\nLawrence](/wiki/DeMarcus_Lawrence \"DeMarcus Lawrence\"), who then fumbled the\nball which was recovered by the Lions. Lawrence would redeem himself by\nsacking Stafford on a 4th down-and-3 play. The sack led to Stafford fumbling\nthe ball again, which Lawrence recovered to seal the game for the Cowboys, who\nwon 24–20. This was the first time in franchise playoff history that Dallas\nhad been down by 10 or more points at halftime and rallied to win the game.\nThe following week, the Cowboys traveled to [Lambeau\nField](/wiki/Lambeau_Field \"Lambeau Field\") in [Green Bay,\nWisconsin](/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin \"Green Bay, Wisconsin\") to play the\n[Packers](/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers \"Green Bay Packers\") in the divisional\nround. Despite having a 14–7 halftime lead, the Cowboys fell to the Packers\n26–21, thus ending their season. The season ended on an overturned call of a\ncompleted catch by Dez Bryant. The catch was challenged by the Packers, and\nthe referees overturned the call because of the \"Calvin Johnson rule.\"\n\nDuring the 2015 offseason the Cowboys allowed running back [DeMarco\nMurray](/wiki/DeMarco_Murray \"DeMarco Murray\") to become a free agent. Murray\nsigned with the [division rival](/wiki/Cowboys%E2%80%93Eagles_rivalry\n\"Cowboys–Eagles rivalry\") [Philadelphia Eagles](/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles\n\"Philadelphia Eagles\"). On July 15 wide receiver [Dez Bryant](/wiki/Dez_Bryant\n\"Dez Bryant\") signed a 5-year, $70 million contract.\n\n### 2015\n\nMain article: [2015 Dallas Cowboys season](/wiki/2015_Dallas_Cowboys_season\n\"2015 Dallas Cowboys season\")\n\nAt home against the [New York Giants](/wiki/New_York_Giants \"New York\nGiants\"), Dallas won 27–26. [Dez Bryant](/wiki/Dez_Bryant \"Dez Bryant\") left\nthe game early with a fractured bone in his foot. On the road against the\n[Philadelphia Eagles](/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles \"Philadelphia Eagles\"), Romo\nsuffered a broken left collarbone, the same one he injured in 2010, and\n[Brandon Weeden](/wiki/Brandon_Weeden \"Brandon Weeden\") replaced him. Dallas\nwon 20–10 to begin the season 2–0, but then went on a seven-game losing\nstreak. Dallas finished the season 4–12 and last in their division.\n\n### 2016\n\nMain article: [2016 Dallas Cowboys season](/wiki/2016_Dallas_Cowboys_season\n\"2016 Dallas Cowboys season\")\n\nAfter a preseason injury to [Tony Romo](/wiki/Tony_Romo \"Tony Romo\"), rookie\nquarterback [Dak Prescott](/wiki/Dak_Prescott \"Dak Prescott\") was slated as\nthe starting quarterback, as Romo was expected to be out 6–8 weeks. In game 1\nagainst the [New York Giants](/wiki/New_York_Giants \"New York Giants\"), Dallas\nlost 20–19. After this loss, Dallas would go on an eleven-game winning streak.\nAfter much speculation leading to a potential quarterback controversy, Romo\nmade an announcement that Prescott has earned the right to take over as\nCowboys quarterback.\n\nIn game 10, Romo suited up for the first time this season and was the backup\nquarterback. Dallas defeated the [Baltimore Ravens](/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens\n\"Baltimore Ravens\") to win their 9th straight game, breaking a franchise\nrecord of 8 straight games set in 1977. It also marked rookie running back\n[Ezekiel Elliott](/wiki/Ezekiel_Elliott \"Ezekiel Elliott\") breaking [Tony\nDorsett](/wiki/Tony_Dorsett \"Tony Dorsett\")'s single season rushing record for\na Cowboys rookie. Prescott also tied an NFL rookie record held by [Russell\nWilson](/wiki/Russell_Wilson \"Russell Wilson\") and [Dan\nMarino](/wiki/Dan_Marino \"Dan Marino\") by throwing multiple touchdowns in 5\nstraight games. Dallas finished 13–3, tying their best 16-game regular season\nrecord. While Dallas defeated Green Bay at [Lambeau Field](/wiki/Lambeau_Field\n\"Lambeau Field\") in week 6, the Packers would win at AT&T Stadium in the\ndivisional round of the [NFL playoffs](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_NFL_playoffs\n\"2016–17 NFL playoffs\") on a last-second field goal, ending their season.\n\nDak Prescott was named NFL Rookie of the Year in the NFL honors on February 4,\n2017, and Ezekiel Elliott led the league in rushing yards. Both Prescott and\nElliott made the [2017 Pro Bowl](/wiki/2017_Pro_Bowl \"2017 Pro Bowl\"). This is\nthe first time the Cowboys sent two rookies to the Pro Bowl.[16]\n\n### 2017\n\nMain article: [2017 Dallas Cowboys season](/wiki/2017_Dallas_Cowboys_season\n\"2017 Dallas Cowboys season\")\n\n2017 was the first season since 2002 without quarterback Tony Romo, who\nretired on April 4 after 14 seasons with the Cowboys. The season also featured\nsecond-year running back Ezekiel Elliott being suspended for 6 games after\nviolating the league's conduct policy. The suspension was to begin at the\nstart of the year but was pushed back to November. The Cowboys finished the\nyear at 9-7 without making the playoffs.\n\n## Logos and uniforms\n\n### Logo\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Cowboys_wordmark.svg/200px-\nCowboys_wordmark.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Cowboys_wordmark.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cowboys_wordmark.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Cowboys' script logo.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' blue star logo, representative of Texas as \"The Lone Star\nState\", is one of the most well-known team logos in professional sports. The\nblue star originally was a solid shape until a white line and blue border was\nadded in 1964. The logo has remained the same since. Today, the blue star has\nbeen extended to not only the Dallas Cowboys, but owner Jerry Jones'\n[AFL](/wiki/Arena_Football_League \"Arena Football League\") team, the [Dallas\nDesperados](/wiki/Dallas_Desperados \"Dallas Desperados\") that have a similar\nlogo based on the Cowboys. The blue star also is used on other entries like an\nimaging facility and storage facility.\n\n### Uniforms\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' white home jersey has royal blue (PMS 287 C) solid socks,\nnumbers, lettering, and two stripes on the sleeves outlined in black. The home\npants are a common metallic silver-green color (PMS 8280 C) that help bring\nout the blue in the uniform. The navy (PMS 289 C) road jerseys (nicknamed the\n\"Stars and Stripes\" jersey) have white lettering and numbers with navy\npinstripes. A white/gray/white stripe are on each sleeve as well as the\ncollared V-neck, and a Cowboys star logo is placed upon the stripes. A\n\"Cowboys\" chest crest is directly under the NFL shield. The away pants are a\npearlish metallic-silver color (PMS 8180 C) and like the home pants, enhance\nthe navy in the uniforms. The team uses a serifed font for the lettered player\nsurnames on the jersey nameplates.[2][3][4]\n\nThe team's helmets are also a unique silver with a tint of blue known as\n\"Metallic Silver Blue\" (PMS 8240 C) and have a blue/white/blue vertical stripe\nplaced upon the center of the crown. The Cowboys also include a unique, if\nsubtle, feature on the back of the helmet: a blue strip of [Dymo](/wiki/Dymo\n\"Dymo\") tape with the player's name embossed, placed on the white portion of\nthe stripe at the back of the helmet.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_Front.jpg/92px-Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_Front.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_Front.jpg)\n\nFront of Dallas Cowboys helmet\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/81/Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_Back.jpg/105px-Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_Back.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_Back.jpg)\n\nBack of Dallas Cowboys helmet\n\n#### Uniform history\n\nWhen the Dallas Cowboys franchise debuted in 1960, the team's uniform included\na white helmet adorned with a simple blue star and a blue-white-blue stripe\ndown the center crown. The team donned blue jerseys with white sleeves and a\nsmall blue star on each shoulder for home games and the negative opposite for\naway games. Their socks also had two horizontal white stripes overlapping the\nblue.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_1960.jpg/120px-Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_1960.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_1960.jpg)\n\nc1960–1963\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Cowboys_blue_uniform_1960.jpg/86px-Cowboys_blue_uniform_1960.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cowboys_blue_uniform_1960.jpg)\n\nBlue home uniforms\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Cowboys_white_uniform_1960.jpg/86px-Cowboys_white_uniform_1960.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cowboys_white_uniform_1960.jpg)\n\nWhite away uniforms\n\nIn 1964 the Cowboys opted for a simpler look (adopting essentially the team's\ncurrent uniform) by changing their jersey/socks to one solid color with three\nhorizontal stripes on the sleeves; the white jersey featured royal blue\nstripes with a narrow black border, the royal blue jersey white stripes with\nthe same black outline. The star-shouldered jerseys were eliminated; \"TV\"\nnumbers appeared just above the jersey stripes. The new helmet was silverblue,\nwith a blue-white-blue tri-stripe down the center (the middle white stripe was\nthicker). The blue \"lone star\" logo was retained, but with a white border\nsetting it off from the silver/blue. The new pants were silverblue, with a\nblue-white-blue tri-stripe. In 1964 the NFL allowed teams to wear white\njerseys at home; several teams did so, and the Cowboys have worn white at home\never since, except on certain \"throwback\" days.\n\nIn 1966, the team modified the jerseys, which now featured only two sleeve\nstripes, slightly wider; the socks followed the same pattern. In 1967 the\n\"lone star\" helmet decal added a blue outline to the white-bordered star,\ngiving the logo a bigger, bolder look. The logo and this version of the\nuniform has seen little change to the present day.\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_1964.jpg/120px-Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_1964.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dallas_Cowboys_helmet_1964.jpg)\n\nc1964–1966\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Cowboys_white_uniform_1964.jpg/86px-Cowboys_white_uniform_1964.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cowboys_white_uniform_1964.jpg)\n\nWhite home uniforms\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Cowboys_blue_uniform_1964.jpg/86px-Cowboys_blue_uniform_1964.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cowboys_blue_uniform_1964.jpg)\n\nBlue away uniforms\n\nThe only notable changes in the last 40 years were:\n\n  * from 1970–1973 when the \"TV\" numbers were moved from the shoulders to the sleeves above the stripes\n  * from 1982–1988 the pants featured a white uniform number in an elliptical blue circle worn near the hip.\n  * the removal of the indented [serifs](/wiki/Serif \"Serif\") on the front and back jersey numbers in the early 1980s (seen currently on the throwback jersey)\n  * In 1980 the blue jersey was rendered in a slightly darker shade than the 1964–79 version; from 1981–1994 the dark jerseys sported numbers that were gray with white borders and a blue pinstripe.

This jersey was used for special occasions\nand was worn throughout the 1994–1995 playoffs. During the same season, the\nCowboys also wore their 1960–63 road jersey with a silver helmet for one game\nas part of a league-wide \"throwback\" policy.\n\nDuring the 1995 season, the team wore the navy \"Double-Star\" jersey for games\nat Washington and Philadelphia and permanently switched to solid color socks\n(royal blue for the white uniform, and navy blue for the dark uniform). The\nnavy \"Double-Star\" jersey was not seen again until the NFL's _Classic\nThrowback Weekend_ on Thanksgiving Day 2001–2003.\n\nIn 2004, the Cowboys resurrected their original 1960–1963 uniform on\nThanksgiving Day. This uniform became the team's alternate or \"third jersey\"\nand was usually worn at least once a year, primarily Thanksgiving Day. Two\nexceptions were when the Cowboys wore their normal white uniforms on\nThanksgiving in 2007 and 2008. While the team didn't wear the throwback\nuniform exactly on Thanksgiving Day in those two years, Dallas wore them on a\ndate around Thanksgiving for those two years. In 2007 Dallas wore the\nthrowback uniform on November 29, 2007 against the Green Bay Packers. In 2008\nDallas wore the throwback uniform on November 23, 2008 against the San\nFrancisco 49ers. The team went back to wearing this uniform at home on\nThanksgiving Day in 2009 while their opponent was the Oakland Raiders who wore\ntheir AFL Legacy Weekend throwbacks. Dallas wore this alternate uniform on\nOctober 11, 2009 as part of one of the NFL's AFL Legacy Weekends when they\ntraveled to Kansas City to play the Chiefs who were sporting their AFL Dallas\nTexans' uniforms. This created a rare game in which neither team wore a white\njersey and the first time the Cowboys wore the alternative uniform as a\nvisiting team. The 1960–1963 uniform may also be used on other special\noccasion. Other instances include the 2005 Monday Night game against the\nWashington Redskins when the team inducted Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and\nMichael Irving into the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and the 2006 Christmas Day game\nagainst the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 2013, the NFL issued a new helmet rule stating that players will no longer\nbe allowed to use alternate helmets due to the league's enhanced concussion\nawareness. This caused the Cowboys' white 1960s throwback helmets to become\nnon-compliant. The team instead decided to wear their normal blue jerseys at\nhome for Thanksgiving, which has since become an annual tradition.[17] In\n2017, the team initially announced that they will wear blue jerseys at home on\na more regular basis, only to rescind soon after.[18][19]\n\nIn 2015, the Cowboys released their [Color Rush](/wiki/NFL_Color_Rush \"NFL\nColor Rush\") uniform, featuring a variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\"\nalternates with white pants and socks. The uniform was first used in a\nThanksgiving game against the Carolina Panthers and in subsequent [Thursday\nNight Football](/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football \"Thursday Night Football\") games\nduring the 2016 and 2017 seasons.\n\nThe Cowboys also unveiled a navy uniform-white pants combination which was\nfirst used on December 10, 2017 against the Giants.[2]\n\n#### Home/road jersey history\n\nIn 1964, Tex Schramm started the tradition of the Cowboys wearing their white\njersey at home, contrary to an unofficial rule that teams should wear colored\njerseys at home. Schramm did this because he wanted fans to see a variety of\nopponents' colors at home games.[17][20][21] Since then, a number of other\nteams have worn their white uniforms at home, including the Miami Dolphins.\nAccording to Mike McCord, the Cowboys' equipment director, one of the reasons\nwhy the Cowboys started wearing white at home was because of the intense heat\nduring Cowboys' home games at [Texas Stadium](/wiki/Texas_Stadium \"Texas\nStadium\").[22][23]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Staubach_and_Lilly_HOF_jerseys.jpg/220px-\nStaubach_and_Lilly_HOF_jerseys.jpg)](/wiki/File:Staubach_and_Lilly_HOF_jerseys.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Staubach_and_Lilly_HOF_jerseys.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRoger Staubach and Bob Lilly jerseys shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in\nCanton, Ohio.\n\nThroughout the years, the Cowboys' blue jersey has been popularly viewed to be\n\"[jinxed](/wiki/Sports-related_curses \"Sports-related curses\")\" because the\nteam often seemed to lose when they wore them. This purported curse drew\nattention after the team lost Super Bowl V with the blue jerseys.[24] However,\nthe roots of the curse likely date back earlier to the 1968 divisional\nplayoffs, when the blue-shirted Cowboys were upset by the Cleveland Browns in\nwhat turned out to be Don Meredith's final game with the Cowboys. Dallas's\nlone victory in a conference championship or Super Bowl wearing the blue\njerseys was in the 1978 NFC Championship game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSince the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, league rules were changed to allow the Super\nBowl home team to pick their choice of jersey. Most of the time, Dallas will\nwear their blue jerseys when they visit Washington, Philadelphia (sometimes),\nMiami, or one of the handful of other teams that traditionally wear their\nwhite jerseys at home during the first half of the season due to the hot\nclimates in their respective cities or other means. Occasionally opposing\nteams will wear their white jerseys at home to try to invoke the curse,[25]\nsuch as when the [Philadelphia Eagles](/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles \"Philadelphia\nEagles\") hosted the Cowboys in the [1980 NFC Championship\nGame](/wiki/1980%E2%80%9381_NFL_playoffs#Conference_championships \"1980–81 NFL\nplayoffs\"),[26] as well as their November 4, 2007 meeting. Various other teams\nfollowed suit in the 1980s.\n\nAlthough Dallas has made several tweaks to their blue jerseys over the years,\nSchramm said he did not believe in the curse.[27] Since the league began\nallowing teams to use an alternate jersey, the Cowboys' alternates have been\nprimarily blue versions of past jerseys and the Cowboys have generally had\nsuccess when wearing these blue alternates. With the implementation of the\n2013 NFL helmet rule for alternate jerseys, the team decided instead to wear\ntheir regular blue jerseys for their Thanksgiving game, something they have\nnot done at home since Schramm started the white-jersey-at-home tradition.[17]\n\n#### Thanksgiving Day uniforms\n\nWith the Cowboys traditionally hosting [Thanksgiving Day\ngames](/wiki/NFL_on_Thanksgiving_Day \"NFL on Thanksgiving Day\"), separate\nuniform practices have been used for these games in recent years. Through the\n2000 season, the Cowboys continued the usual practice of wearing white at\nhome. In 2001, the Cowboys wore blue at home for the first time in years, but\nit was an older design of the blue jersey. Dallas would lose the game, but\nagain wore the older blue jersey at home on Thanksgiving the next year and\nwon. With the 2002 victory, it seems an exception the theory of the blue\njersey jinx is invoked on Thanksgiving.\n\nThus, the Cowboys continued wearing blue at home on Thanksgiving from\n2003–2006, however it was always an older-styled blue jersey. In 2007 and\n2008, the Cowboys returned to wearing white at home for their Thanksgiving\ngame. Since 2009, the Cowboys returned to wearing blue at home on Thanksgiving\nonly (From 2009–2012, the team again decided to go with an older-styled blue\nuniform as they had in previous years on Thanksgiving, and since 2013 have\nworn the newer-styled blue jersey).\n\nIn the 2015 season, the Cowboys wore their [Color Rush](/wiki/Color_Rush\n\"Color Rush\") variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" jerseys for a Thanksgiving\ngame against the Carolina Panthers.[28]\n\n## Stadiums\n\n### Cotton Bowl\n\nMain article: [Cotton Bowl (stadium)](/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_\\(stadium\\) \"Cotton\nBowl \\(stadium\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/CottonBowl.jpg/220px-\nCottonBowl.jpg)](/wiki/File:CottonBowl.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CottonBowl.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe main entrance of the Cotton Bowl\n\nThe Cotton Bowl is a stadium which opened in 1932 and became known as \"The\nHouse That Doak Built\" due to the immense crowds that former SMU running back\nDoak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s.\nOriginally known as the Fair Park Bowl, it is located in [Fair\nPark](/wiki/Fair_Park \"Fair Park\"), site of the [State Fair of\nTexas](/wiki/State_Fair_of_Texas \"State Fair of Texas\").

The stadium\nopened on October 24, 1971, at a cost of $35 million and with a [seating\ncapacity](/wiki/Seating_capacity \"Seating capacity\") of 65,675. The stadium\nwas famous for its hole-in-the-roof dome. The roof's worn paint had become so\nunsightly in the early 2000s that it was repainted in the summer of 2006 by\nthe City of Irving. It was the first time the famed roof was repainted since\nTexas Stadium opened. The roof was structurally independent from the stadium\nit covered. The Cowboys lost their final game at Texas Stadium to the\n[Baltimore Ravens](/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens \"Baltimore Ravens\"), 33–24, on\nDecember 20, 2008.

The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until\nTitans coach [Jeff Fisher](/wiki/Jeff_Fisher \"Jeff Fisher\") informed the\nofficials that the punt struck the [scoreboard](/wiki/Scoreboard\n\"Scoreboard\"). (Many believe Trapasso was trying to hit the suspended\nscoreboard, based on replays and the angle of the kick.) The scoreboard is,\nhowever, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines — hanging approximately\nfive feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the\nentire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009,\nthe day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted\nthat half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the\nscreen.

Three of the four\nteams have been division rivals since the Cowboys' entry into the NFL. As\nsuch, the Cowboys have some of the longest and fiercest rivalries in the\nsport.\n\n### Washington Redskins\n\nMain article: [Cowboys–Redskins\nrivalry](/wiki/Cowboys%E2%80%93Redskins_rivalry \"Cowboys–Redskins rivalry\")\n\nThe Redskins and Dallas Cowboys enjoy what has been called by _Sports\nIllustrated_ the top NFL rivalry of all time and \"one of the greatest in\nsports.\" Some sources trace the enmity to before the Cowboys were even formed,\ndue to a longstanding disagreement between Redskins owner [George Preston\nMarshall](/wiki/George_Preston_Marshall \"George Preston Marshall\") and Cowboys\nfounder [Clint Murchison Jr.](/wiki/Clint_Murchison_Jr. \"Clint Murchison Jr.\")\nover the creation of a new football team in the South, due to Preston's TV\nmonopoly in that region. The two teams' storied on-field rivalry goes back to\n1960 when the two clubs first played each other, resulting in a 26–14\nWashington victory. Since that time, the two teams have met in 116 regular\nseason contests and two NFC Championships. Dallas leads the regular season\nall-time series 70–42–2, and the Redskins lead the all-time playoff series\n2–0. The Cowboys currently have a 14–7 advantage over the Redskins at FedEx\nField. Some notable moments in the rivalry include Washington's victory over\nDallas in the 1982 NFC Championship and the latter's 1989 win over the\nRedskins for their only victory that season. The last Cowboys game with Tom\nLandry as coach was a win over Washington on December 11, 1988. In the 2010s,\nthe Redskins have struggled to consistently compete for the Division title,\nbut still play the Cowboys particularly tough, posting an impressive upset\nvictory against Dallas in 2014, despite being outclassed by the Cowboys in the\noverall standings.\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles\n\nMain article: [Cowboys–Eagles rivalry](/wiki/Cowboys%E2%80%93Eagles_rivalry\n\"Cowboys–Eagles rivalry\")\n\nThe competition with Philadelphia has been particularly intense since the late\n1970s, when the long-moribund Eagles returned to contention. In January 1981,\nthe two teams faced off in the NFC Championship, with Philadelphia winning\n20–7. A series of other factors heightened tensions during the 1980s and\n1990s, including several provocative actions by Philadelphia fans and Eagles\nhead coach [Buddy Ryan](/wiki/Buddy_Ryan \"Buddy Ryan\"). Among these were the\n1989 \"[Bounty Bowls](/wiki/Bounty_Bowl \"Bounty Bowl\")\", in which Ryan\nallegedly placed a bounty on Dallas kicker [Luis Zendejas](/wiki/Luis_Zendejas\n\"Luis Zendejas\") and [Veterans Stadium](/wiki/Veterans_Stadium \"Veterans\nStadium\") fans pelted the Cowboys with snowballs and other debris. A 1999 game\nat Philadelphia saw Eagles fans cheering as Michael Irvin lay motionless and\npossibly paralyzed on the field. In 2008 the rivalry became more intense when\nin the last game of the year in which both teams could clinch a playoff spot\nwith a victory, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Cowboys 44–6. The\nfollowing season, the Cowboys avenged that defeat by beating the Eagles three\ntimes: twice during the regular season to claim the title as NFC East\nchampions and once more in a wild-card playoff game by a combined score of\n78–30, including a 24–0 shutout in week 17. That three game sweep was Dallas'\nfirst over any opponent and the longest winning streak against the Eagles\nsince 1992–1995 when Dallas won seven straight matches against Philadelphia.\nDuring the 2013 season Dallas won the first meeting 17–3 at [Lincoln Financial\nField](/wiki/Lincoln_Financial_Field \"Lincoln Financial Field\") in\nPhiladelphia. They would meet again in Week 17 at AT&T Stadium with the winner\nclinching the 2013 NFC East title. The Cowboys came into the game at a\ndisadvantage with starting quarterback [Tony Romo](/wiki/Tony_Romo \"Tony\nRomo\") out with a season ending back injury which put backup [Kyle\nOrton](/wiki/Kyle_Orton \"Kyle Orton\") as the starter. It was a tight game with\nthe Eagles up 24–22 with less than 2 minutes to go in regulation. Orton got\nthe ball and started driving down the field when he was intercepted by the\nEagles defense, which ended the game and the Cowboys season. In 2014, the\nCowboys and Eagles both won against each other on the road, with Philadelphia\nposting a dominant 33–10 win on [Thanksgiving\nDay](/wiki/National_Football_League_on_Thanksgiving_Day \"National Football\nLeague on Thanksgiving Day\") in Dallas, and Dallas returning the favor two\nweeks later by defeating the Eagles 38–27 in Philadelphia. The second game\nbetween these rivals clenched a playoff spot for Dallas and led to formerly\nfirst place Philadelphia missing out on the post-season. Dallas leads the\nregular season all-time series 63–50.\n\n### New York Giants\n\nMain article: [Cowboys–Giants rivalry](/wiki/Cowboys%E2%80%93Giants_rivalry\n\"Cowboys–Giants rivalry\")\n\nThe first game ever played between the Giants and Cowboys was a 31–31 tie on\nDecember 4, 1960. Dallas logged its first win in the series on October 29,\n1961 and New York's first was on November 11, 1962. Among the more notable\nmoments in the rivalry was the Giants' defeat of Dallas in the 2007 playoffs\nen route to their victory in [Super Bowl XLII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLII \"Super\nBowl XLII\") and winning the first regular season game played at [Cowboys\nStadium](/wiki/Cowboys_Stadium \"Cowboys Stadium\") in 2009. Dallas currently\nleads the all-time series 64–45–2.[38]\n\n### Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nMain article: [Cowboys–Steelers\nrivalry](/wiki/Cowboys%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Cowboys–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nThe two teams met in the first regular season game the Cowboys ever played in\n1960 (a 35–28 loss to the [Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh\nSteelers\")), the first-ever regular season victory for the expansion Cowboys\nin 1961, and would later meet in three Super Bowls, all of them closely\ncontested events. The Steelers-Cowboys is to date the Super Bowl matchup with\nthe most contests. The Steelers won [Super Bowl X](/wiki/Super_Bowl_X \"Super\nBowl X\") and [Super Bowl XIII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XIII \"Super Bowl XIII\"); both\ngames were decided in the final seconds, first on a last-second throw by\n[Roger Staubach](/wiki/Roger_Staubach \"Roger Staubach\"), then as a fourth-\nquarter rally by Dallas fell short on an [onside kick](/wiki/Onside_kick\n\"Onside kick\"). The Cowboys won [Super Bowl XXX](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXX \"Super\nBowl XXX\") in January 1996. It is said that the rivalry was fueled in the\n1970s due to the stark contrast of the teams: the Cowboys, being more of a\n\"flashy\" team with [Roger Staubach](/wiki/Roger_Staubach \"Roger Staubach\")'s\naerial attack and the \"flex\" [Doomsday Defense](/wiki/Doomsday_Defense\n\"Doomsday Defense\"); while the Steelers were more of a [\"blue-\ncollar\"](/wiki/Blue-collar_worker \"Blue-collar worker\") team with a strong\nrunning game and the 1970s-esque [Steel Curtain](/wiki/Steel_Curtain \"Steel\nCurtain\") defense, a contrast that still exists today.[39] In addition, both\nteams have national fan bases rivaled by few NFL teams, and both come from\nareas with a strong following for football at all levels. Dallas leads the\nall-time series 16–13 including the playoffs.[38]\n\n### San Francisco 49ers\n\nMain article: [49ers–Cowboys rivalry](/wiki/49ers%E2%80%93Cowboys_rivalry\n\"49ers–Cowboys rivalry\")\n\nThe bitter rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and [San Francisco\n49ers](/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers \"San Francisco 49ers\") has been going on\nsince the 1970s.[40][41] The [NFL Top 10](/wiki/NFL_Top_10 \"NFL Top 10\")\nranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in the history of the NFL. San\nFrancisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated\nthe 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972\nDivisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco,\nwhich saw the 49ers' [Joe Montana](/wiki/Joe_Montana \"Joe Montana\") complete a\ngame-winning pass to [Dwight Clark](/wiki/Dwight_Clark \"Dwight Clark\") in the\nfinal minute (now known as [The Catch](/wiki/The_Catch_\\(American_football\\)\n\"The Catch \\(American football\\)\")) is one of the most famous games in NFL\nhistory. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992–1994 seasons.\nSan Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three\nseparate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the\nthird. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win\nthe Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers (and the [New England\nPatriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\")) are second all\ntime in [Super Bowl](/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\") victories to the\n[Pittsburgh Steelers](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") with\nfive each. The 49ers-Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural\nrivalry between California and Texas. The 49ers lead the series all-time\nseries with a record of 15–13–1.\n\n### Green Bay Packers\n\nMain article: [Cowboys-Packers rivalry](/wiki/Cowboys-Packers_rivalry\n\"Cowboys-Packers rivalry\")\n\nThe Cowboys–Packers rivalry is rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the\n[Green Bay Packers](/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers \"Green Bay Packers\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] It is\none of the best known intra-conference\n[rivalry](/wiki/National_Football_League_rivalries \"National Football League\nrivalries\") games in the NFL. The two teams do not play every year; instead,\nthey play once every three years due to the NFL's rotating division schedules,\nor if the two teams finish in the same place in their respective divisions,\nthey would play the ensuing season. The rivalry has also resulted in notable\n[playoff](/wiki/Playoff \"Playoff\") games.[42][43]\n\nThe all time regular seasons series record is 15–13 in favor of the Packers,\nand the postseason series is tied 4–4.\n\n## Season-by-season records\n\nMain article: [List of Dallas Cowboys\nseasons](/wiki/List_of_Dallas_Cowboys_seasons \"List of Dallas Cowboys\nseasons\")\n\n## Players of note\n\nMain article: [List of Dallas Cowboys\nplayers](/wiki/List_of_Dallas_Cowboys_players \"List of Dallas Cowboys\nplayers\")\n\n### Current roster\n\nDallas Cowboys roster\n\n  * [view](/wiki/Template:Dallas_Cowboys_roster \"Template:Dallas Cowboys roster\")\n  * [talk](/wiki/Template_talk:Dallas_Cowboys_roster \"Template talk:Dallas Cowboys roster\")\n  * [edit](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Dallas_Cowboys_roster&action=edit)\n\n  \n---  \n**Quarterbacks**\n\n  * 4 [Dak Prescott](/wiki/Dak_Prescott \"Dak Prescott\")\n  * 7 [Cooper Rush](/wiki/Cooper_Rush \"Cooper Rush\")\n\n**Running backs**\n\n  * 21 [Ezekiel Elliott](/wiki/Ezekiel_Elliott \"Ezekiel Elliott\")\n  * 49 [Jamize Olawale](/wiki/Jamize_Olawale \"Jamize Olawale\") FB\n  * 45 [Rod Smith](/wiki/Rod_Smith_\\(running_back\\) \"Rod Smith \\(running back\\)\")\n  * 34 [Trey Williams](/wiki/Trey_Williams \"Trey Williams\")\n\n**Wide receivers**\n\n  * 11 [Cole Beasley](/wiki/Cole_Beasley \"Cole Beasley\")\n  * 18 [Brian Brown](/w/index.php?title=Brian_Brown_\\(American_football\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Brian Brown \\(American football\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\")\n  * 85 [Noah Brown](/wiki/Noah_Brown_\\(American_football\\) \"Noah Brown \\(American football\\)\")\n  * 88 [Dez Bryant](/wiki/Dez_Bryant \"Dez Bryant\")\n  * 81 [K.

numbers of past\nstandouts as a matter of policy. Instead, the team has a [\"Ring of\nHonor\"](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys_Ring_of_Honor \"Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor\"),\nwhich is on permanent display encircling the field. Originally at Texas\nStadium, the ring is now on display at [AT&T Stadium](/wiki/AT%26T_Stadium\n\"AT&T Stadium\") in Arlington. The first inductee was Bob Lilly in 1975 and by\n2005, the ring contained 17 names, all former Dallas players except for one\nhead coach and one general manager/president. Although the team does not\nofficially retire jersey numbers, some are kept \"unofficially inactive\", so it\nis uncommon to find any current players wearing the number of one of the **\"\nRing of Honor\"** inductees. For instance, the jersey numbers of inductees\nAikman (8), Staubach (12), Hayes and Smith (22), Irvin (88), and Lilly (74)\nwere not worn during the 2008 season. For the 2010 season, number 88 was\nissued to rookie [Dez Bryant](/wiki/Dez_Bryant \"Dez Bryant\").\n\nThe Ring of Honor has been a source of controversy over the years. Tex Schramm\nwas believed to be a \"one-man committee\" in choosing inductees and many former\nCowboys players and fans felt that Schramm deliberately excluded linebacker\n[Lee Roy Jordan](/wiki/Lee_Roy_Jordan \"Lee Roy Jordan\") because of a bitter\ncontract dispute the two had during Jordan's playing days. When Jerry Jones\nbought the team he inherited Schramm's Ring of Honor \"power\" and immediately\ninducted Jordan.\n\nJones also has sparked controversy regarding his decisions in handling the\n\"Ring of Honor\". For four years he was unsuccessful in convincing Tom Landry\nto accept induction. Meanwhile, he refused to induct Tex Schramm (even after\nSchramm's induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame). In 1993, thanks in part\nto the efforts of Roger Staubach as an intermediary, Landry accepted induction\nand had a ceremony on the day of that year's Cowboys-Giants game (Landry had\nplayed and coached for the Giants). In 2003, Jones finally chose to induct Tex\nSchramm. Schramm and Jones held a joint press conference at Texas Stadium\nannouncing the induction. Unfortunately, Schramm did not live to see his\nceremonial induction at the Cowboys-Eagles game that fall.\n\nSome of the more recent inductees were Troy Aikman, all-time NFL leading\nrusher Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin, known as \"The Triplets\". The Cowboys\nwaited until Smith had retired as a player before inducting Aikman and Irvin,\nso all three could be inducted together, which occurred during halftime at a\nMonday Night Football home game against the arch-rival Washington Redskins on\nSeptember 19, 2005.\n\nThe most recent inductees are defensive end [Charles\nHaley](/wiki/Charles_Haley \"Charles Haley\"), offensive lineman [Larry\nAllen](/wiki/Larry_Allen \"Larry Allen\"), and wide receiver [Drew\nPearson](/wiki/Drew_Pearson_\\(American_football\\) \"Drew Pearson \\(American\nfootball\\)\"), who were inducted into the Ring of Honor during halftime of the\nCowboys' game vs. the [Seattle Seahawks](/wiki/2011_Seattle_Seahawks_season\n\"2011 Seattle Seahawks season\") on November 6, 2011, and safety [Darren\nWoodson](/wiki/Darren_Woodson \"Darren Woodson\"), who was inducted on November\n1, 2015.\n\n### All-time first-round draft picks\n\nMain article: [List of Dallas Cowboys first-round

[KRLD-FM](/wiki/KRLD-FM\n\"KRLD-FM\"). [Brad Sham](/wiki/Brad_Sham \"Brad Sham\") is the team's longtime\n[play-by-play voice](/wiki/Sports_commentator \"Sports commentator\"). Working\nalongside him is former Cowboy quarterback [Babe\nLaufenberg](/wiki/Babe_Laufenberg \"Babe Laufenberg\"), who returned in 2007\nafter a one-year absence to replace former safety Charlie Waters. The Cowboys,\nwho retain rights to all announcers, chose not to renew Laufenberg's contract\nin 2006 and brought in Waters. However, Laufenberg did work as the analyst on\nthe \"Blue Star Network\", which televises Cowboys preseason games not shown on\nnational networks. The anchor station is [KTVT](/wiki/KTVT \"KTVT\"), the\n[CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") owned and operated station in Dallas. Previous stations\nwhich aired Cowboys games included [KVIL-FM](/wiki/KVIL-FM \"KVIL-FM\"),\n[KRLD](/wiki/KRLD_\\(AM\\) \"KRLD \\(AM\\)\"), and [KLUV-FM](/wiki/KLUV-FM \"KLUV-\nFM\"). Kristi Scales is the sideline reporter on the radio broadcasts.\n\nDuring his tenure as Cowboys coach, Tom Landry co-hosted his own coach's show\nwith late veteran sportscaster [Frank Glieber](/wiki/Frank_Glieber \"Frank\nGlieber\") and later with Brad Sham. Landry's show was famous for his analysis\nof raw game footage and for he and his co-host making their NFL \"predictions\"\nat the end of each show. Glieber is one of the original voices of the Cowboys\nRadio Network, along with [Bill Mercer](/wiki/Bill_Mercer \"Bill Mercer\"),\nfamous for calling the _Ice Bowl_ of 1967 and both Super Bowl V and VI. Mercer\nis perhaps best known as the ringside commentator of [World Class Championship\nWrestling](/wiki/World_Class_Championship_Wrestling \"World Class Championship\nWrestling\") in the 1980s. Upon Mercer's departure, [Verne\nLundquist](/wiki/Verne_Lundquist \"Verne Lundquist\") joined the network, and\nbecame their play-by-play announcer by 1977, serving eight years in that\ncapacity before handing those chores permanently over to Brad Sham, who joined\nthe network in 1977 as the color analyst and occasional fill-in for Lundquist.\n\nLongtime [WFAA-TV](/wiki/WFAA-TV \"WFAA-TV\") sports anchor [Dale\nHansen](/wiki/Dale_Hansen \"Dale Hansen\") was the Cowboys color analyst with\nBrad Sham as the play-by-play announcer from 1985–1996.\n\nDave Garrett served as the Cowboys' play-by-play announcer from 1995–97, when\nBrad Sham left the team and joined the Texas Rangers' radio network team as\nwell as broadcast Sunday Night Football on Westwood One.\n\nSeeking to expand its radio broadcasting scope nationally, the Cowboys began a\nfive-year partnership with [Compass Media\nNetworks](/wiki/Compass_Media_Networks \"Compass Media Networks\") on February\n2, 2011. The result was the America's Team Radio Network, a supplement to the\nfranchise's regional one.[44] Beginning with the 2011 season, [Kevin\nBurkhardt](/wiki/Kevin_Burkhardt \"Kevin Burkhardt\") and [Danny\nWhite](/wiki/Danny_White \"Danny White\") handled the broadcasts, with [Jerry\nRecco](/wiki/Jerry_Recco \"Jerry Recco\") as the studio host.[45]\n\n## See also\n\n  * ![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/American_football.svg/28px-American_football.svg.png)[American football portal](/wiki/Portal:American_football \"Portal:American football\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Downtown_Dallas_from_the_Trinity_River.jpg/32px-Downtown_Dallas_from_the_Trinity_River.jpg)](/wiki/File:Downtown_Dallas_from_the_Trinity_River.jpg)[Dallas-Fort Worth portal](/wiki/Portal:Dallas-Fort_Worth \"Portal:Dallas-Fort Worth\")\n\n  * [Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders](/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys_Cheerleaders \"Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders\")\n  * [List of Dallas Cowboys seasons](/wiki/List_of_Dallas_Cowboys_seasons \"List of Dallas Cowboys seasons\")\n  * [List of Dallas Cowboys players](/wiki/List_of_Dallas_Cowboys_players \"List of Dallas Cowboys players\")\n  * [America's Team](/wiki/America%27s_Team \"America's Team\")\n  * [Doomsday Defense](/wiki/Doomsday_Defense \"Doomsday Defense\")\n\n## References\n\n  * NFL 2002 Record & Fact Book [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [0-7611-2643-0](/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-7611-2643-0 \"Special:BookSources/0-7611-2643-0\")\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"1960 Dallas Cowboys\"](http://www.dallascowboys.com/team/history/1960-dallas-cowboys).
