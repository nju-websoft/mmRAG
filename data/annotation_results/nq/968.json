They are\noften cited as the first band to define the punk rock sound.[1][2] Despite\nachieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on\nthe 1970s punk movement in both the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nAll of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname \"Ramone\",\nalthough none of them were related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring\nvirtually nonstop for 22 years.[2] In 1996, after a tour with the\n[Lollapalooza](/wiki/Lollapalooza \"Lollapalooza\") music festival, the band\n[played a farewell concert](/wiki/We%27re_Outta_Here! \"We're Outta Here!\") and\ndisbanded.[3] By 2014, all four of the band's original members, lead singer\n[Joey Ramone](/wiki/Joey_Ramone \"Joey Ramone\") (1951–2001), bass guitarist\n[Dee Dee Ramone](/wiki/Dee_Dee_Ramone \"Dee Dee Ramone\") (1951–2002), guitarist\n[Johnny Ramone](/wiki/Johnny_Ramone \"Johnny Ramone\") (1948–2004) and drummer\n[Tommy Ramone](/wiki/Tommy_Ramone \"Tommy Ramone\") (1949–2014), had\ndied.[4][5][6][7]\n\nRecognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now\nmentioned in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as number 26\nin the _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ magazine list of\nthe \"[100 Greatest Artists of All\nTime](/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_100_Greatest_Artists_of_All_Time \"Rolling\nStone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\")\"[8] and number 17 in\n[VH1](/wiki/VH1 \"VH1\")'s \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".[9] In 2002, the\nRamones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by\n_[Spin](/wiki/Spin_\\(magazine\\) \"Spin \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine, trailing only\n[the Beatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\").[10] On March 18, 2002, the\noriginal four members and Tommy's replacement on drums, [Marky\nRamone](/wiki/Marky_Ramone \"Marky Ramone\"), were inducted into the [Rock and\nRoll Hall of Fame](/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame \"Rock and Roll Hall of\nFame\").[2][11] In 2011, the group was awarded a [Grammy Lifetime Achievement\nAward](/wiki/Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award \"Grammy Lifetime Achievement\nAward\").[12][13]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n    * 1.1 Formation: 1974–1975\n    * 1.2 Spearheading punk: 1976–1977\n    * 1.3 Recordings turn more pop: 1978–1983\n    * 1.4 Shuffling members: 1983–1989\n    * 1.5 Final years: 1990–1996\n    * 1.6 Aftermath and deaths\n  * 2 Conflicts between members\n  * 3 Style\n    * 3.1 Musical style\n    * 3.2 Visual imagery\n  * 4 Influence\n    * 4.1 Tribute albums\n  * 5 Band members\n  * 6 Discography\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 Sources\n  * 10 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ramones&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n### Formation:\n1974–1975[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ramones&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Formation: 1974–1975\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/ForestHillsHS.jpg/170px-\nForestHillsHS.jpg)](/wiki/File:ForestHillsHS.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ForestHillsHS.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Forest Hills High School](/wiki/Forest_Hills_High_School_\\(New_York\\) \"Forest\nHills High School \\(New York\\)\"), attended by the four original members of the\nRamones\n\nThe original members of the band met in and around the middle-class\nneighborhood of [Forest Hills](/wiki/Forest_Hills,_Queens \"Forest Hills,\nQueens\") in the New York City borough of [Queens](/wiki/Queens,_New_York\n\"Queens, New York\"). [John Cummings](/wiki/Johnny_Ramone \"Johnny Ramone\") and\n[Thomas Erdelyi](/wiki/Tommy_Ramone \"Tommy Ramone\") had both been in a high-\nschool [garage band](/wiki/Garage_rock \"Garage rock\") from 1965 to 1967 known\nas the Tangerine Puppets.[14] They became friends with [Douglas\nColvin](/wiki/Dee_Dee_Ramone \"Dee Dee Ramone\"), who had recently moved to the\narea from Germany,[15] and [Jeffrey Hyman](/wiki/Joey_Ramone \"Joey Ramone\"),\nwho was the initial lead singer of the [glam rock](/wiki/Glam_rock \"Glam\nrock\") band [Sniper](/wiki/Sniper_\\(American_band\\) \"Sniper \\(American\nband\\)\"), founded in 1972.[16][17]\n\nThe Ramones began taking shape in early 1974 when Cummings and Colvin invited\nHyman to join them in a band. The initial line-up featured Colvin on lead\nvocals, rhythm and bass guitars, Cummings on lead guitar, and Hyman on drums.\nHyman soon switched from drums to vocals. Colvin was the first to adopt the\nname \"Ramone\", calling himself Dee Dee Ramone. He was inspired by [Paul\nMcCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\")'s use of the pseudonym Paul\nRamon during his [Silver Beetles](/wiki/The_Quarrymen \"The Quarrymen\")\ndays.[18][19] Dee Dee convinced the other members to take on the name and came\nup with the idea of calling the band the Ramones.[20] Hyman and Cummings\nbecame Joey and Johnny Ramone, respectively.[20]\n\nA friend of the band, Monte A. Melnick (later their tour manager), helped to\narrange rehearsal time for them at Manhattan's Performance Studios, where he\nworked. Johnny's former bandmate Erdelyi was set to become their manager. Soon\nafter the band was formed, Dee Dee realized that he could not sing and play\nhis bass guitar simultaneously; with Erdelyi's encouragement, Joey became the\nband's new lead singer.[18] Dee Dee would continue, however, to count off each\nsong's tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of \"1-2-3-4!\" Joey soon\nsimilarly realized that he could not sing and play drums simultaneously and\nleft the position of drummer. While auditioning prospective replacements,\nErdelyi would often take to the drums and demonstrate how to play the songs.\nIt became apparent that he was able to perform the group's music better than\nanyone else, and he joined the band as Tommy Ramone.[21]\n\nThe Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30, 1974, at\nPerformance Studios.[2] The songs they played were very fast and very short;\nmost clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was\nemerging in New York centered on two clubs in [downtown\nManhattan](/wiki/Lower_Manhattan \"Lower Manhattan\")—[Max's Kansas\nCity](/wiki/Max%27s_Kansas_City \"Max's Kansas City\") and, more famously,\n[CBGB](/wiki/CBGB \"CBGB\") (usually referred to as CBGB's). The Ramones made\ntheir CBGB debut on August 16, 1974.[22] [Legs McNeil](/wiki/Legs_McNeil \"Legs\nMcNeil\"), who cofounded _[Punk](/wiki/Punk_\\(magazine\\) \"Punk \\(magazine\\)\")_\nmagazine the following year, later described the impact of that performance:\n\"They were all wearing these black leather jackets. And they counted off this\nsong... and it was just this wall of noise... They looked so striking. These\nguys were not hippies. This was something completely new.\"[23]\n\nThe band swiftly became regulars at the club, playing there seventy-four times\nby the end of the year. After garnering considerable attention for their\nperformances—which averaged about seventeen minutes from beginning to end—the\ngroup was signed to a recording contract in late 1975 by [Seymour\nStein](/wiki/Seymour_Stein \"Seymour Stein\") of [Sire\nRecords](/wiki/Sire_Records \"Sire Records\"). After they were seen by Sire A&R\nman [Craig Leon](/wiki/Craig_Leon \"Craig Leon\")[24] he brought the band to the\nattention of the label. Stein's wife, [Linda Stein](/wiki/Linda_S._Stein\n\"Linda S. Stein\"), saw the band play at Mothers; she would later co-manage\nthem along with [Danny Fields](/wiki/Danny_Fields \"Danny Fields\").[25] By this\ntime, the Ramones were recognized as leaders of the new scene that was\nincreasingly being referred to as \"[punk](/wiki/Punk_rock \"Punk\nrock\")\".[26][27] The group's unusual frontman had a lot to do with their\nimpact. As Dee Dee explained, \"All the other singers [in New York] were\ncopying [David Johansen](/wiki/David_Johansen \"David Johansen\") [of [the New\nYork Dolls](/wiki/The_New_York_Dolls \"The New York Dolls\")], who was copying\n[Mick Jagger](/wiki/Mick_Jagger \"Mick Jagger\")... But Joey was unique, totally\nunique.\"[28]\n\n### Spearheading punk:\n1976–1977[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ramones&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Spearheading punk: 1976–1977\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png) |  [\"Blitzkrieg Bop\"](/wiki/File:Ramones-Blitzkrieg_Bop.ogg \"File:Ramones-Blitzkrieg Bop.ogg\") ![](data:image/png,%89PNG%0D%0A%1A%0A%00%00%00%0DIHDR%00%00%00%01%00%00%00%01%08%02%00%00%00%90wS%DE%00%00%00%01sRGB%00%AE%CE%1C%E9%00%00%00%09pHYs%00%00%0B%13%00%00%0B%13%01%00%9A%9C%18%00%00%00%07tIME%07%DB%0B%0A%17%041%80%9B%E7%F2%00%00%00%19tEXtComment%00Created%20with%20GIMPW%81%0E%17%00%00%00%0CIDAT%08%D7c%60%60%60%00%00%00%04%00%01'4'%0A%00%00%00%00IEND%AEB%60%82)[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ramones-Blitzkrieg_Bop.ogg) The title of the Ramones' debut single, writes critic Steve Huey, is a \"nice encapsulation of the group's aesthetic: simple, bouncy, pre-[British Invasion](/wiki/British_Invasion \"British Invasion\") rock & roll played at top volume and twice the speed.

Of the fourteen songs on the album, the\nlongest, \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\", barely surpassed two and a\nhalf minutes. While the songwriting credits were shared by the entire band,\nDee Dee was the primary writer.[32] The _Ramones_ album was produced by Sire's\n[Craig Leon](/wiki/Craig_Leon \"Craig Leon\"), with Tommy as associate producer,\non an extremely low budget of about $6,400 and released in April.[33] The now\niconic [front cover\nphotograph](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Ramones_-\n_Ramones_cover.jpg \"Ramones - Ramones cover.jpg\") of the band was taken by\nRoberta Bayley, a photographer for _[Punk](/wiki/Punk_\\(magazine\\) \"Punk\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine.[34] _Punk_ , which was largely responsible for\ncodifying the term for the scene emerging around CBGB, ran a cover story on\nthe Ramones in its third issue, the same month as the record's\nrelease.[30][35]\n\nThe Ramones' debut LP was greeted by rock critics with glowing reviews. The\n_[Village Voice](/wiki/Village_Voice \"Village Voice\")_ 's [Robert\nChristgau](/wiki/Robert_Christgau \"Robert Christgau\") wrote, \"I love this\nrecord—love it—even though I know these boys flirt with images of brutality\n(Nazi especially)... For me, it blows everything else off the radio\".[36] In\n_[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone \"Rolling Stone\")_ , [Paul\nNelson](/wiki/Paul_Nelson_\\(critic\\) \"Paul Nelson \\(critic\\)\") described it as\n\"constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of an exhilarating intensity\nrock & roll has not experienced since its earliest days.\" Characterizing the\nband as \"authentic American primitives whose work has to be heard to be\nunderstood\", he declared, \"It is time popular music followed the other arts in\nhonoring its primitives.\"[37] _[Newsday](/wiki/Newsday \"Newsday\")_ 's Wayne\nRobbins simply anointed the Ramones as \"the best young rock 'n' roll band in\nthe known universe.\"[38]\n\nDespite Sire's high hopes for it,[39] _Ramones_ was not a commercial success,\nreaching only number 111 on the _[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_charts \"Billboard\ncharts\")_ album chart.[40] The two singles issued from the album, \"[Blitzkrieg\nBop](/wiki/Blitzkrieg_Bop \"Blitzkrieg Bop\")\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\",\nfailed to chart. At the band's first major performance outside of New York, a\nJune date in [Youngstown, Ohio](/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio \"Youngstown, Ohio\"),\nmembers of Cleveland punk legends Frankenstein aka the [Dead\nBoys](/wiki/The_Dead_Boys \"The Dead Boys\") were present and struck up a\nfriendship with the band.[41] It wasn't until they made a brief tour of\nEngland that they began to see the fruits of their labor; a performance at the\n[Roundhouse](/wiki/Roundhouse_\\(venue\\) \"Roundhouse \\(venue\\)\") in London on\nJuly 4, 1976, second-billed to the [Flamin' Groovies](/wiki/Flamin%27_Groovies\n\"Flamin' Groovies\"), organized by Linda Stein, was a resounding success.[42]\n[T-Rex](/wiki/T-Rex_\\(band\\) \"T-Rex \\(band\\)\") leader [Marc\nBolan](/wiki/Marc_Bolan \"Marc Bolan\") was in attendance at the Roundhouse show\nand was invited on stage.[43][44] Their Roundhouse appearance and a club date\nthe following night—where the band met members of the [Sex\nPistols](/wiki/Sex_Pistols \"Sex Pistols\") and [the Clash](/wiki/The_Clash \"The\nClash\")—helped galvanize the burgeoning UK punk rock scene.[4] The Flamin'\nGroovies/Ramones double bill was successfully reprised at the [Roxy\nTheatre](/wiki/Roxy_Theatre_\\(West_Hollywood\\) \"Roxy Theatre \\(West\nHollywood\\)\") in Los Angeles the following month, fueling the [punk scene\nthere](/wiki/Punk_rock_in_California \"Punk rock in California\") as well. The\nRamones were becoming an increasingly popular live act—a Toronto performance\nin September energized yet another growing punk scene.[45]\n\nTheir next two albums, _[Leave Home](/wiki/Leave_Home \"Leave Home\")_ and\n_[Rocket to Russia](/wiki/Rocket_to_Russia \"Rocket to Russia\")_ , were\nreleased in 1977. Both were produced by Tommy and [Tony\nBongiovi](/wiki/Tony_Bongiovi \"Tony Bongiovi\"), the second cousin of [Jon Bon\nJovi](/wiki/Jon_Bon_Jovi \"Jon Bon Jovi\").[46] _Leave Home_ met with even less\nchart success than _Ramones_ , though it did include \"Pinhead\", which became\none of the band's signature songs with its chanted refrain of \"Gabba gabba\nhey!\" _Leave Home_ also included a fast-paced cover of the oldie \"[California\nSun](/wiki/California_Sun \"California Sun\")\", written by Henry Glover & Morris\nLevy, and originally recorded by Joe Jones,[47] though the Ramones based their\nversion on the remake by the Rivieras. _Rocket to Russia_ was the band's\nhighest-charting album to date, reaching number 49 on the [_Billboard_\n200](/wiki/Billboard_200 \"Billboard 200\").[48] In _Rolling Stone_ , critic\n[Dave Marsh](/wiki/Dave_Marsh \"Dave Marsh\") called it \"the best American rock\n& roll of the year\".[49] The album also featured the first Ramones single to\nenter the _Billboard_ charts (albeit only as high as number 81): \"[Sheena Is a\nPunk Rocker](/wiki/Sheena_Is_a_Punk_Rocker \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\")\". The\nfollow-up single, \"Rockaway Beach\", reached number 66—the highest any Ramones\nsingle would ever reach in America. On December 31, 1977 the Ramones recorded\n_[It's Alive](/wiki/It%27s_Alive_\\(Ramones_album\\) \"It's Alive \\(Ramones\nalbum\\)\")_, a live concert double album, at the [Rainbow\nTheatre](/wiki/Rainbow_\\(London\\) \"Rainbow \\(London\\)\"), London, which was\nreleased in April 1979 (the title is a reference to the [1974 horror film of\nthe same name](/wiki/It%27s_Alive_\\(1974_film\\) \"It's Alive \\(1974\nfilm\\)\")).[50]\n\n### Recordings turn more pop:\n1978–1983[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ramones&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Recordings turn more pop: 1978–1983\")]\n\nTommy, tired of touring, left the band in early 1978. He continued as the\nRamones' record producer under his birth name of Erdelyi. His position as\ndrummer was filled by [Marc Bell](/wiki/Marky_Ramone \"Marky Ramone\"), who had\nbeen a member of the early 1970s hard rock band [Dust](/wiki/Dust_\\(band\\)\n\"Dust \\(band\\)\"), [Wayne County and the Backstreet Boys](/wiki/Jayne_County\n\"Jayne County\"),[51] and the pioneering punk group [Richard Hell & the\nVoidoids](/wiki/The_Voidoids \"The Voidoids\").[52] Bell became Marky Ramone.\nLater that year, the band released their fourth studio album, and first with\nMarky, _[Road to Ruin](/wiki/Road_to_Ruin_\\(Ramones_album\\) \"Road to Ruin\n\\(Ramones album\\)\")_. The album, co-produced by Tommy with [Ed\nStasium](/wiki/Ed_Stasium \"Ed Stasium\"), included some new sounds such as\nacoustic guitar, several ballads, and the band's first two recorded songs\nlonger than three minutes. It failed to reach the [_Billboard_ Top\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Top_100 \"Billboard Top 100\"). However, \"[I Wanna Be\nSedated](/wiki/I_Wanna_Be_Sedated \"I Wanna Be Sedated\")\", which appeared both\non the album and as a single, would become one of the band's best-known\nsongs.[53] The artwork on the album's cover was done by _Punk_ magazine\ncofounder [John Holmstrom](/wiki/John_Holmstrom \"John Holmstrom\").[54]\n\nAfter the band's movie debut in [Roger Corman](/wiki/Roger_Corman \"Roger\nCorman\")'s _[Rock'n' Roll High School](/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_High_School\n\"Rock 'n' Roll High School\")_ (1979), renowned producer [Phil\nSpector](/wiki/Phil_Spector \"Phil Spector\") became interested in the Ramones\nand produced their 1980 album _[End of the Century](/wiki/End_of_the_Century\n\"End of the Century\")_. During the recording sessions in Los Angeles, Spector\nheld Johnny at gunpoint, forcing him to repeatedly play a riff.[55] Though it\nwas to be the highest-charting album in the band's history—reaching number 44\nin the United States and number 14 in Great Britain—Johnny made clear that he\nfavored the band's more aggressive punk material: \"_End of the Century_ was\njust watered-down Ramones. It's not the real Ramones.\"[56] This stance was\nalso conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny\nlater oversaw, _[Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest\nHits](/wiki/Loud,_Fast_Ramones:_Their_Toughest_Hits \"Loud, Fast Ramones: Their\nToughest Hits\")_. Despite these reservations, Johnny did concede that some of\nSpector's work with the band had merit, saying \"It really worked when he got\nto a slower song like '[Danny Says](/wiki/Danny_Says \"Danny Says\")'—the\nproduction really worked tremendously. 'Rock 'N' Roll Radio' is really good.\nFor the harder stuff, it didn't work as well.\"[57] The string-laden\n[Ronettes](/wiki/The_Ronettes \"The Ronettes\") cover \"[Baby, I Love\nYou](/wiki/Baby,_I_Love_You \"Baby, I Love You\")\" released as a single, became\nthe band's biggest hit in Great Britain, reaching number 8 on the charts.[58]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Ramones_1983_b.jpg/220px-\nRamones_1983_b.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ramones_1983_b.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ramones_1983_b.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJoey and Dee Dee Ramone in concert, 1983\n\n_[Pleasant Dreams](/wiki/Pleasant_Dreams \"Pleasant Dreams\")_ , the band's\nsixth album, was released in 1981.

In the past, it was always just\nme singing for the most part.\"[68] Richie was also the only drummer to be the\nsole composer of Ramones songs including their hit \"[Somebody Put Something in\nMy Drink](/wiki/Somebody_Put_Something_in_My_Drink \"Somebody Put Something in\nMy Drink\")\" as well as \"Smash You\", \"Humankind\", \"I'm Not Jesus\", \"I Know\nBetter Now\" and \"(You) Can't Say Anything Nice\". Joey Ramone supported\nRichie's songwriting contributions: \"I encouraged Richie to write songs. I\nfigured it would make him feel more a part of the group, because we never let\nanybody else write our songs.\"[69][70] Richie's composition, \"Somebody Put\nSomething in My Drink\", remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their\nlast show in 1996 and was included in the album _Loud, Fast Ramones: Their\nToughest Hits_.[71] The eight song bonus disc, _The Ramones Smash You: Live\n'85_, is also named after Richie's composition \"Smash You\".\n\nThe first album the Ramones recorded with Richie was _[Too Tough to\nDie](/wiki/Too_Tough_to_Die \"Too Tough to Die\")_ in 1984, with Tommy Erdelyi\nand Ed Stasium returning as producers.

Produced by [Jean\nBeauvoir](/wiki/Jean_Beauvoir \"Jean Beauvoir\"), formerly a member of the\n[Plasmatics](/wiki/Plasmatics \"Plasmatics\"), the album was characterized by a\n_Rolling Stone_ reviewer as \"nonstop primal fuzz pop\".[77] Making it his pick\nfor \"album of the week\", _New York Times_ critic [Jon\nPareles](/wiki/Jon_Pareles \"Jon Pareles\") wrote that the Ramones \"speak up for\noutcasts and disturbed individuals\".[78]\n\nThe following year the band recorded their last album with Richie, _[Halfway\nto Sanity](/wiki/Halfway_to_Sanity \"Halfway to Sanity\")._ Richie left in\nAugust 1987, upset that after being in the band for five years, the other\nmembers would still not give him a share of the money they made selling\nT-shirts.[79] Richie was replaced by [Clem Burke](/wiki/Clem_Burke \"Clem\nBurke\") from [Blondie](/wiki/Blondie_\\(band\\) \"Blondie \\(band\\)\"), which was\ndisbanded at the time. According to Johnny, the performances with Burke—who\nadopted the name Elvis Ramone—were a disaster. He was fired after two\nperformances (August 28 & 29, 1987) because his drumming could not keep up\nwith the rest of the band.[79] In September, Marky, now clean and sober,\nreturned to the band.[20]\n\nIn December 1988, the Ramones recorded material for their eleventh studio\nalbum, _[Brain Drain](/wiki/Brain_Drain_\\(album\\) \"Brain Drain \\(album\\)\")_ ;\nco-produced by Beauvoir, Rey, and [Bill Laswell](/wiki/Bill_Laswell \"Bill\nLaswell\").

A recording of the concert was later released on video and CD\nas _[We're Outta Here!](/wiki/We%27re_Outta_Here! \"We're Outta Here!\")_.

At the ceremony,\nthe surviving inductees spoke on behalf of the band. Johnny spoke first,\nthanking the band's fans and blessing [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush\n\"George W. Bush\") and his presidency. Tommy spoke next, saying how honored the\nband felt, but how much it would have meant for Joey. Dee Dee humorously\ncongratulated and thanked himself, while Marky thanked Tommy for influencing\nhis drum style. [Green Day](/wiki/Green_Day \"Green Day\") played \"Teenage\nLobotomy\", \"Rockaway Beach\", and \"[Blitzkrieg Bop](/wiki/Blitzkrieg_Bop\n\"Blitzkrieg Bop\")\" as a tribute, demonstrating the Ramones' continuing\ninfluence on later rock musicians. The ceremony was one of Dee Dee's last\npublic appearances; on June 5, 2002, two months later, he was found at his\nHollywood home, dead from a heroin overdose.[5]\n\nOn November 30, 2003, New York City unveiled a sign designating East 2nd\nStreet at the corner of Bowery as Joey Ramone Place. The singer lived on East\n2nd for a time, and the sign is near the former Bowery site of CBGB.[89] The\ndocumentary film _[End of the Century: The Story of the\nRamones](/wiki/End_of_the_Century:_The_Story_of_the_Ramones \"End of the\nCentury: The Story of the Ramones\")_ came out in 2004. Johnny, who had been\nprivately suffering from prostate cancer, died on September 15, 2004 in Los\nAngeles, shortly after the film's release.[6] On the same day as Johnny's\ndeath, the world's first [Ramones Museum](/wiki/Ramones_Museum \"Ramones\nMuseum\") opened its doors to the public. Located in Berlin, Germany, the\nmuseum features more than 300 items of memorabilia, including a pair of stage-\nworn jeans from Johnny, a stage-worn glove from Joey, Marky's sneakers, and\nC.J.'s stage-worn bass strap.[90]\n\nThe Ramones were inducted into the [Long Island Music Hall of\nFame](/wiki/Long_Island_Music_Hall_of_Fame \"Long Island Music Hall of Fame\")\nin 2007.[91] That October saw the release of a DVD set containing concert\nfootage of the band: _[It's Alive 1974-1996](/wiki/It%27s_Alive_1974-1996\n\"It's Alive 1974-1996\")_ includes 118 songs from 33 performances over the span\nof the group's career.[92] In February 2011 the group was honored with a\n[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award](/wiki/Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award\n\"Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award\"). Drummers Tommy, Marky, and Richie\nattended the ceremony.[12][13] Marky declared, \"This is amazing. I never\nexpected this. I'm sure Johnny, Joey, and Dee Dee would never have expected\nthis.\"[12] Richie noted that it was the first time ever that all three\ndrummers were under the same roof, and mused that he couldn't \"help thinking\nthat [Joey] is watching us right now with a little smile on his face behind\nhis rose-colored glasses.\"[13]\n\nOn April 30, 2014, their first album, _Ramones_ , became certified Gold by the\nRecording Industry of America after selling 500,000 copies, 38 years after its\nrelease.\n\n[Arturo Vega](/wiki/Arturo_Vega \"Arturo Vega\"), creative director from their\nformation in 1974 until their disbanding in 1996 and often considered the\nfifth Ramone[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_], died on June 8, 2013, at the age of 65.

The pair were politically antagonistic, Joey being a\n[liberal](/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States \"Liberalism in the United\nStates\") and Johnny a [conservative](/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States\n\"Conservatism in the United States\"). Their personalities also clashed:\nJohnny, who spent two years in military school, lived by a strict code of\nself-discipline,[95] while Joey struggled with [obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder](/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder \"Obsessive-compulsive disorder\")\nand alcoholism.[96][97] In the early 1980s, [Linda Ramone](/wiki/Linda_Ramone\n\"Linda Ramone\") began a relationship with Johnny after having already been\nromantically involved with Joey. Consequently, despite their continued\nprofessional relationship, Joey and Johnny had become aloof.[6] It was not\nuntil after Joey's death that Johnny had admitted to not calling Joey prior to\nhis passing, and in the documentary _End of the Century_ Johnny claimed that\nJoey's death had a profound impact on him emotionally and that he was\ndepressed for \"the whole week\" after his death.[79]\n\nDee Dee's [bipolar disorder](/wiki/Bipolar_disorder \"Bipolar disorder\") and\nrepeated relapses into drug addiction also caused significant strains.[98]\nTommy would also leave the band after being \"physically threatened by Johnny,\ntreated with contempt by Dee Dee, and all but ignored by Joey\".[99] As new\nmembers joined over the years, disbursement and the bands' image frequently\nbecame matters of serious dispute.[100] The tensions among the group members\nwere not kept secret from the public as was heard on the [Howard\nStern](/wiki/Howard_Stern \"Howard Stern\") radio show in 1997, where during the\ninterview Marky and Joey got into a fight about their respective drinking\nhabits.[101]\n\n## Style[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ramones&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Style\")]\n\n### Musical style[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ramones&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Musical style\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png) |  [\"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\"](/wiki/File:Ramones_Sheena.ogg \"File:Ramones Sheena.ogg\") ![](data:image/png,%89PNG%0D%0A%1A%0A%00%00%00%0DIHDR%00%00%00%01%00%00%00%01%08%02%00%00%00%90wS%DE%00%00%00%01sRGB%00%AE%CE%1C%E9%00%00%00%09pHYs%00%00%0B%13%00%00%0B%13%01%00%9A%9C%18%00%00%00%07tIME%07%DB%0B%0A%17%041%80%9B%E7%F2%00%00%00%19tEXtComment%00Created%20with%20GIMPW%81%0E%17%00%00%00%0CIDAT%08%D7c%60%60%60%00%00%00%04%00%01'4'%0A%00%00%00%00IEND%AEB%60%82)[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/Ramones_Sheena.ogg) Cultural critic Anders Johannsson uses this 1977 single as an example of how most Ramones songs \"work in the same way: the same hammering on the drums, the same distorted guitars, the same howling of an extremely short text, in a simple tune with an even simpler chorus\".[102]\n\n* * *  \n  \n---|---  \n_Problems playing this file? See[media help](/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_help\n\"Wikipedia:Media help\")._  \n  \nThe Ramones' loud, fast, straightforward musical style was influenced by pop\nmusic that the band members grew up listening to in the 1950s and 1960s,\nincluding classic rock groups such as [the Beach Boys](/wiki/The_Beach_Boys\n\"The Beach Boys\"), [the Who](/wiki/The_Who \"The Who\"), [the\nBeatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The Beatles\"), [the Kinks](/wiki/The_Kinks \"The\nKinks\"), [Led Zeppelin](/wiki/Led_Zeppelin \"Led Zeppelin\"), [the Rolling\nStones](/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones \"The Rolling Stones\") and [Creedence\nClearwater Revival](/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival \"Creedence Clearwater\nRevival\"); [bubblegum](/wiki/Bubblegum_pop \"Bubblegum pop\") acts like the\n[1910 Fruitgum Company](/wiki/1910_Fruitgum_Company \"1910 Fruitgum Company\")\nand [Ohio Express](/wiki/Ohio_Express \"Ohio Express\"); and girl groups such as\n[the Ronettes](/wiki/The_Ronettes \"The Ronettes\") and [the Shangri-\nLas](/wiki/The_Shangri-Las \"The Shangri-Las\"). They also drew on the harder\nrock sound of the [MC5](/wiki/MC5 \"MC5\"), [Black Sabbath](/wiki/Black_Sabbath\n\"Black Sabbath\"),[103] [the Stooges](/wiki/The_Stooges \"The Stooges\") and the\n[New York Dolls](/wiki/New_York_Dolls \"New York Dolls\"), now known as seminal\n[protopunk](/wiki/Protopunk \"Protopunk\") bands.[104] The Ramones' style was in\npart a reaction against the heavily produced, often bombastic music that\ndominated the pop charts in the 1970s. \"We decided to start our own group\nbecause we were bored with everything we heard,\" Joey once explained. \"In\n[1974](/wiki/1974_in_music \"1974 in music\") everything was tenth-generation\n[Elton John](/wiki/Elton_John \"Elton John\"), or overproduced, or just junk.\nEverything was long jams, long guitar solos ... . We missed music like it used\nto be.\"[105] [Ira Robbins](/wiki/Ira_Robbins \"Ira Robbins\") and Scott Isler of\n_[Trouser Press](/wiki/Trouser_Press \"Trouser Press\")_ describe the result:\n\n> With just four chords and one manic tempo, New York's Ramones blasted open\n> the clogged arteries of mid-'70s rock, reanimating the music. Their genius\n> was to recapture the short/simple aesthetic from which pop had strayed,\n> adding a caustic sense of trash-culture humor and minimalist rhythm guitar\n> sound.[106]\n\nAs leaders in the [punk rock](/wiki/Punk_rock \"Punk rock\") scene, the Ramones'\nmusic has usually been identified with that label,[1] while some have defined\ntheir characteristic style more specifically as [pop punk](/wiki/Pop_punk \"Pop\npunk\")[107] and others as [power pop](/wiki/Power_pop \"Power pop\").[108] In\nthe 1980s, the band sometimes veered into [hardcore punk](/wiki/Hardcore_punk\n\"Hardcore punk\") territory, as can be heard on _[Too Tough to\nDie](/wiki/Too_Tough_to_Die \"Too Tough to Die\")_.[106]\n\nOn stage, the band adopted a focused approach directly intended to increase\nthe audience's concert experience. Johnny's instructions to C.J. when\npreparing for his first live performances with the group were to play facing\nthe audience, to stand with the bass slung low between spread legs, and to\nwalk forward to the front of stage at the same time as he did. Johnny was not\na fan of guitarists who performed facing their drummer, amplifier, or other\nband members.[109]\n\n### Visual imagery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ramones&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Visual imagery\")]\n\nThe Ramones' art and visual imagery complemented the themes of their music and\nperformance. The band members adopted a uniform look of long hair, leather\njackets, T-shirts, torn jeans, and sneakers. This fashion emphasized\nminimalism, which was a powerful influence on the New York punk scene of the\n1970s and reflected the band's short, simple songs.[110] Tommy Ramone recalled\nthat, both musically and visually, \"we were influenced by comic books, movies,\nthe [Andy Warhol](/wiki/Andy_Warhol \"Andy Warhol\") scene, and avant-garde\nfilms. I was a big _[Mad](/wiki/Mad_\\(magazine\\) \"Mad \\(magazine\\)\")_ magazine\nfan myself.\"[110]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/57/Ramones_logo.jpg/220px-\nRamones_logo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ramones_logo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ramones_logo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe band's logo, based on the [Seal of the President of the United\nStates](/wiki/Seal_of_the_President_of_the_United_States \"Seal of the\nPresident of the United States\")\n\nThe band's logo was created by New York City artist [Arturo\nVega](/wiki/Arturo_Vega \"Arturo Vega\") together with the Ramones. Vega was a\nlongtime friend who had allowed Joey and Dee Dee to move into his loft.[111]\nVega produced the band's T-shirts, their main source of income, basing most of\nthe images on a black-and-white self-portrait photograph he had taken of his\nAmerican bald eagle belt buckle which had appeared on the back sleeve of the\nRamones' first album.[112] He was inspired to create the band's logo after a\ntrip to Washington, D.C.:\n\n> I saw them as the ultimate all-American band. To me, they reflected the\n> American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression ... . I\n> thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be\n> perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength\n> and the aggression that would be used against whomever dares to attack\n> us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we\n> decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an\n> apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since\n> Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat\n> instead of the [Great Seal]'s arrows.[112]\n\nThe scroll in the eagle's beak originally read \"Look out below\", but this was\nsoon changed to \"Hey ho let's go\" after the opening lyrics of the band's first\nsingle, \"[Blitzkrieg Bop](/wiki/Blitzkrieg_Bop \"Blitzkrieg Bop\")\". The\narrowheads on the shield came from a design on a polyester shirt Vega had\nbought. The name \"Ramones\" was spelled out in block capitals above the logo\nusing plastic stick-on letters.[25] Where the presidential emblem read \"Seal\nof the President of the United States\" clockwise in the border around the\neagle, Vega instead placed the pseudonyms of the four band members: Johnny,\nJoey, Dee Dee, and Tommy. Over the years the names in the border would change\nas the band's line-up fluctuated.[113]\n\n## Influence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ramones&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Influence\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Johnny-\nRamone_1977.jpg/170px-Johnny-Ramone_1977.jpg)](/wiki/File:Johnny-\nRamone_1977.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Johnny-Ramone_1977.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJohnny Ramone in concert, 1977\n\nThe Ramones had a broad and lasting influence on the development of [popular\nmusic](/wiki/Popular_music \"Popular music\").

The next\nnight, members of both bands attended the Ramones' gig at the Dingwall's club.\nRamones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and\nClash bassist [Paul Simonon](/wiki/Paul_Simonon \"Paul Simonon\") (which he\nmislocates at the Roundhouse): \"Johnny asked him, 'What do you do? Are you in\na band?' Paul said, 'Well, we just rehearse. We call ourselves the Clash but\nwe're not good enough.' Johnny said, 'Wait till you see us—we stink, we're\nlousy, we can't play. Just get out there and do it.'\"[120] Another band whose\nmembers saw the Ramones perform, [the Damned](/wiki/The_Damned_\\(band\\) \"The\nDamned \\(band\\)\"), played their first show two days later. The central\n[fanzine](/wiki/Fanzine \"Fanzine\") of the early UK punk scene, _[Sniffin'\nGlue](/wiki/Sniffin%27_Glue \"Sniffin' Glue\")_, was named after the song \"Now I\nWanna Sniff Some Glue\", which appeared on the debut LP.[121]\n\nRamones concerts and recordings influenced many musicians central to the\ndevelopment of [California punk](/wiki/Punk_rock_in_California \"Punk rock in\nCalifornia\") as well, including [Greg Ginn](/wiki/Greg_Ginn \"Greg Ginn\") of\n[Black Flag](/wiki/Black_Flag_\\(band\\) \"Black Flag \\(band\\)\"),[122] [Jello\nBiafra](/wiki/Jello_Biafra \"Jello Biafra\") of the [Dead\nKennedys](/wiki/Dead_Kennedys \"Dead Kennedys\"),[123] [Al\nJourgensen](/wiki/Al_Jourgensen \"Al Jourgensen\") of\n[Ministry](/wiki/Ministry_\\(band\\) \"Ministry \\(band\\)\"),[124] [Mike\nNess](/wiki/Mike_Ness \"Mike Ness\") of [Social\nDistortion](/wiki/Social_Distortion \"Social Distortion\"),[125] [Brett\nGurewitz](/wiki/Brett_Gurewitz \"Brett Gurewitz\") of [Bad\nReligion](/wiki/Bad_Religion \"Bad Religion\"),[126] and members of the\n[Descendents](/wiki/Descendents \"Descendents\").[127] Canada's first major punk\nscenes—in Toronto and in [British Columbia](/wiki/British_Columbia \"British\nColumbia\")'s [Victoria](/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia \"Victoria, British\nColumbia\") and Vancouver—were also heavily influenced by the Ramones.[45][128]\nIn the late 1970s, many bands emerged with musical styles deeply indebted to\nthe band's. There were [the Lurkers](/wiki/The_Lurkers \"The Lurkers\") from\nEngland,[129] [the Undertones](/wiki/The_Undertones \"The Undertones\") from\nIreland,[130] [Teenage Head](/wiki/Teenage_Head_\\(band\\) \"Teenage Head\n\\(band\\)\") from Canada,[131] and [the Zeros](/wiki/The_Zeros_\\(American_band\\)\n\"The Zeros \\(American band\\)\")[132] and [the Dickies](/wiki/The_Dickies \"The\nDickies\")[133] from southern California. The seminal hardcore band [Bad\nBrains](/wiki/Bad_Brains \"Bad Brains\") took its name from a Ramones song.[134]\nThe [Riverdales](/wiki/Riverdales \"Riverdales\") emulated the sound of the\nRamones throughout their career.[135] [Green Day](/wiki/Green_Day \"Green Day\")\nfrontman [Billie Joe Armstrong](/wiki/Billie_Joe_Armstrong \"Billie Joe\nArmstrong\") named his son Joey in homage to Joey Ramone, and drummer [Tré\nCool](/wiki/Tr%C3%A9_Cool \"Tré Cool\") named his daughter Ramona.[136]\n\nNew Jersey's [horror punk](/wiki/Horror_punk \"Horror punk\")/[hardcore\npunk](/wiki/Hardcore_punk \"Hardcore punk\") band the\n[Misfits](/wiki/Misfits_\\(band\\) \"Misfits \\(band\\)\") (whose bassist [Jerry\nOnly](/wiki/Jerry_Only \"Jerry Only\") was a longtime friend of the band) were\ninfluenced by the \"Blitzkrieg\" tempo of the Ramones, infusing it into their\nalready medium-fast tempo, [R&B](/wiki/R%26B \"R&B\") style of punk rock.\n\nThe Ramones also influenced musicians associated with other genres, such as\n[heavy metal](/wiki/Heavy_metal_music \"Heavy metal music\"). Their influence on\nmetal gave birth to the punk-metal \"fusion\" genre of\n[thrash](/wiki/Thrash_metal \"Thrash metal\"). [Metallica](/wiki/Metallica\n\"Metallica\") guitarist [Kirk Hammett](/wiki/Kirk_Hammett \"Kirk Hammett\"), one\nof the originators of thrash guitar, has described the importance of Johnny's\nrapid-fire guitar playing style to his own musical development.[137]\n[Motörhead](/wiki/Mot%C3%B6rhead \"Motörhead\") lead singer [Lemmy](/wiki/Lemmy\n\"Lemmy\"), a friend of the Ramones since the late 1970s, mixed the band's \"Go\nHome Ann\" in 1985. The members of Motörhead later composed the song\n\"[R.A.M.O.N.E.S.](/wiki/R.A.M.O.N.E.S. \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S.\")\" as a tribute, and\nLemmy performed at the final Ramones concert in 1996.[138] In the realm of\n[alternative rock](/wiki/Alternative_rock \"Alternative rock\"), the song \"[53rd\nand 3rd](/wiki/53rd_and_3rd \"53rd and 3rd\")\" lent its name to a British [indie\npop](/wiki/Indie_pop \"Indie pop\") label cofounded by Stephen Pastel of the\nScottish band [the Pastels](/wiki/The_Pastels \"The Pastels\"). [Evan\nDando](/wiki/Evan_Dando \"Evan Dando\") of [the Lemonheads](/wiki/The_Lemonheads\n\"The Lemonheads\"),[139] [Dave Grohl](/wiki/Dave_Grohl \"Dave Grohl\") of\n[Nirvana](/wiki/Nirvana_\\(band\\) \"Nirvana \\(band\\)\") and [Foo\nFighters](/wiki/Foo_Fighters \"Foo Fighters\"),[121] [Mike\nPortnoy](/wiki/Mike_Portnoy \"Mike Portnoy\") of [Dream\nTheater](/wiki/Dream_Theater \"Dream Theater\"), [Eddie\nVedder](/wiki/Eddie_Vedder \"Eddie Vedder\") of [Pearl Jam](/wiki/Pearl_Jam\n\"Pearl Jam\")[140] (who introduced the band members at their Rock and Roll Hall\nof Fame induction) and [the Strokes](/wiki/The_Strokes \"The Strokes\")[141] are\namong the many alternative rock and metal musicians who have credited the\nRamones with inspiring them.[142]\n\nThe band members were also individually influential. [Johnny\nRamone](/wiki/Johnny_Ramone \"Johnny Ramone\") was named one of\n_[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\")'_s \"10 Greatest Electric-\nGuitar Players\" in 2003.[143] That same year, he was number 16 on the \"100\nGreatest Guitarists of All Time\" list in _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone\n\"Rolling Stone\")_.[144]\n\n\"We think of the Ramones as a classic, iconic band,\" observed [Gene\nSimmons](/wiki/Gene_Simmons \"Gene Simmons\"). \"They have [one gold\nrecord](/wiki/Ramones_\\(album\\) \"Ramones \\(album\\)\") to their name. They never\nplayed arenas; couldn't sell them out. It was a failed band. It doesn't mean\nthey weren't great. It means the masses didn't care.\"[145]\n\n[Kevin Morby](/wiki/Kevin_Morby \"Kevin Morby\")'s fourth album _City Music_\nfeatures the track \"1234\" inspired by the singer's childhood love of Ramones.\nIt features the lyrics \"Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, Tommy/ They were all my\nfriends, but they died.\"\n\n### Tribute albums[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ramones&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Tribute albums\")]\n\nIn April 2009, _Spin_ writer Mark Prindle observed that the Ramones had to\ndate \"inspired a jaw-dropping 48 (at least!) full-length tribute\nrecords.\"[146] The first Ramones tribute album featuring multiple performers\nwas released in 1991: _[Gabba Gabba Hey: A Tribute to the\nRamones](/wiki/Gabba_Gabba_Hey:_A_Tribute_to_the_Ramones \"Gabba Gabba Hey: A\nTribute to the Ramones\")_ includes tracks by such acts as [the Flesh\nEaters](/wiki/The_Flesh_Eaters \"The Flesh Eaters\"), [L7](/wiki/L7_\\(band\\) \"L7\n\\(band\\)\"), [Mojo Nixon](/wiki/Mojo_Nixon \"Mojo Nixon\"), and Bad\nReligion.[142] In 2001, Dee Dee made a guest appearance on one track of\n_[Ramones Maniacs](/wiki/Ramones_Maniacs \"Ramones Maniacs\")_ , a multi-artist\ncover of the entire _[Ramones Mania](/wiki/Ramones_Mania \"Ramones Mania\")_\ncompilation album. _[The Song Ramones the\nSame](/wiki/The_Song_Ramones_the_Same \"The Song Ramones the Same\")_ , which\ncame out the following year, includes performances by [the\nDictators](/wiki/The_Dictators \"The Dictators\"), who were part of the early\nNew York punk scene, and [Wayne Kramer](/wiki/Wayne_Kramer_\\(guitarist\\)\n\"Wayne Kramer \\(guitarist\\)\"), guitarist for the influential protopunk band\n[MC5](/wiki/MC5 \"MC5\"). _[We're a Happy Family: A Tribute to\nRamones](/wiki/We%27re_a_Happy_Family:_A_Tribute_to_Ramones \"We're a Happy\nFamily: A Tribute to Ramones\")_, released in 2003, features performers such as\n[Rancid](/wiki/Rancid_\\(band\\) \"Rancid \\(band\\)\"), [Green Day](/wiki/Green_Day\n\"Green Day\"), [Metallica](/wiki/Metallica \"Metallica\"),\n[Kiss](/wiki/Kiss_\\(band\\) \"Kiss \\(band\\)\"), [the\nOffspring](/wiki/The_Offspring \"The Offspring\"), [Red Hot Chili\nPeppers](/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers \"Red Hot Chili Peppers\"), [U2](/wiki/U2\n\"U2\"), and [Rob Zombie](/wiki/Rob_Zombie \"Rob Zombie\") (who also did the album\ncover artwork).[147] Also some other famous bands recorded tribute songs.\nMotörhead's Phil Campbell tells in Jari-Pekka Laitio-Ramone's book _Ramones:\nSoundtrack Of Our Lives_ : \"We did a cover of Rockaway Beach with me on\nbacking vocals, which was quite enjoyable. When Johnny Ramone heard it, he\nrefused to put it on the tribute album.
