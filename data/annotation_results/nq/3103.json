[Wilbert\nRobinson](/wiki/Wilbert_Robinson \"Wilbert Robinson\") was the first player to\nrecord at least 10 RBIs in a single game,[3][4] driving in 11 runs for the\n[Baltimore Orioles](/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles_\\(19th_century\\) \"Baltimore\nOrioles \\(19th century\\)\") against the [St. Louis\nBrowns](/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals \"St. Louis Cardinals\") on June 10, 1892.[5]\n\nAs of\n2016[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Major_League_Baseball_single-\ngame_runs_batted_in_leaders&action=edit), every team that has had a player\nachieve the milestone has won the game in which it occurred. These games have\nresulted in other single-game MLB records being set due to the stellar\noffensive performance.

his 12 RBIs for the [St. Louis Cardinals](/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals\n\"St. Louis Cardinals\") on September 7, 1993, tying the single-game records in\nboth categories.[7][8] By attaining both milestones, he became one of only two\nplayers to hit four home runs and drive in 10 or more runs in the same\ngame,[3] with [Scooter Gennett](/wiki/Scooter_Gennett \"Scooter Gennett\") being\nthe other.[2][9] [Tony Lazzeri](/wiki/Tony_Lazzeri \"Tony Lazzeri\"), [Rudy\nYork](/wiki/Rudy_York \"Rudy York\"), and [Nomar\nGarciaparra](/wiki/Nomar_Garciaparra \"Nomar Garciaparra\") hit two
