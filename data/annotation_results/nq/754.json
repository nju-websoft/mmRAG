Grant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S. Grant\"), the reservation\nwas first located near [Fort Stanton](/wiki/Fort_Stanton \"Fort Stanton\"). The\npresent reservation was established in 1883. It has a land area of 1,862.463\nkm² (719.101 sq mi), almost entirely in [Otero\nCounty](/wiki/Otero_County,_New_Mexico \"Otero County, New Mexico\"). The\n463,000-acre reservation lies on the eastern flank of the [Sacramento\nMountains](/wiki/Sacramento_Mountains \"Sacramento Mountains\") and borders the\n[Lincoln National Forest](/wiki/Lincoln_National_Forest \"Lincoln National\nForest\"). A small unpopulated section is in [Lincoln\nCounty](/wiki/Lincoln_County,_New_Mexico \"Lincoln County, New Mexico\") just\nsouthwest of [Ruidoso](/wiki/Ruidoso,_New_Mexico \"Ruidoso, New Mexico\"). [U.S.\nRoute 70](/wiki/U.S._Route_70_in_New_Mexico \"U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico\") is\nthe major highway through the reservation.\n\nThe tribe has an economy based largely on ranching and tourism. The mountains\nand foothills are forested with pines; resource and commercial development is\nmanaged carefully by the Mescalero Apache Tribal Council. The Mescalero Apache\ndeveloped a cultural center near the tribal headquarters on U.S. Route 70 in\nthe reservation's largest community of [Mescalero](/wiki/Mescalero,_New_Mexico\n\"Mescalero, New Mexico\"). On display are tribal artifacts and important\nhistorical information. The tribe also operates another, larger museum on the\nwestern flank of the [Sacramento Mountains](/wiki/Sacramento_Mountains\n\"Sacramento Mountains\") in Dog Canyon, south of\n[Alamogordo](/wiki/Alamogordo,_New_Mexico \"Alamogordo, New Mexico\").\n\nThe tribe developed and owns the Inn of the Mountain Gods Resort and Casino\n(\"IMG\") within Lincoln National Forest. As part of the IMG operation, the\ntribe also owns and manages Ski Apache under contract as a concession with the\nUS Forest Service. It is the southernmost major ski area in North America. In\nJanuary 2012, Ski Apache celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\nThe [ski area](/wiki/Ski_area \"Ski area\") is situated adjacent to the massive\npeak of [Sierra Blanca](/wiki/Sierra_Blanca_\\(New_Mexico\\) \"Sierra Blanca\n\\(New Mexico\\)\") a 12,003-foot (3,659 m) mountain.[2] It is the southernmost\nalpine peak in the Continental [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United\nStates\") and is part of the [Sacramento Mountains](/wiki/Sacramento_Mountains\n\"Sacramento Mountains\").

The eight Tribal Council members also are elected for two years.\nElection for the Council is held every year, when one half of the members are\nup for reelection. The reservation had a population of 3,156 according to the\n[2000 census](/wiki/United_States_Census,_2000 \"United States Census, 2000\").\n\nIn 1959, the tribe elected [Virginia Klinekole](/wiki/Virginia_Klinekole\n\"Virginia Klinekole\") as its first woman president.[4] She later was elected\nto the Tribal Council, serving on it until 1986.[5] The tribe repeatedly re-\nelected [Wendell Chino](/wiki/Wendell_Chino \"Wendell Chino\") as president; he\nserved a total of 43 years, until his death on November 4, 1998.\n\nSoon after Chino's death, the late [Sara Misquez](/wiki/Sara_Misquez \"Sara\nMisquez\") was elected as president. Chino's son, Mark Chino, also has been\nelected and served as president.\n\nNew officers have served in the 21st century. On January 11, 2008 [Carleton\nNaiche-Palmer](/wiki/Carleton_Naiche-Palmer \"Carleton Naiche-Palmer\") was\nsworn in as the new president of the Mescalero Apache tribe.[6] From 2014 to\n2018, Danny Breuninger was President of the Mescalero Apache Tribe. Currently\nserving in the Office of President is Arthur \"Butch\" Blazer. Gabe Aguilar has\nbeen Vice President of the Mescalero Apache Tribe since 2014.\n\n## Culture and\nlanguage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mescalero&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Culture and language\")]\n\n[![\\[icon\\]](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg) |  **This section needs expansion** with: section. You can help by [adding to it](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mescalero&action=edit&section=). _(October 2010)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe [Mescalero language](/wiki/Mescalero_language \"Mescalero language\") is a\n[Southern Athabaskan language](/wiki/Southern_Athabaskan_languages \"Southern\nAthabaskan languages\") which is a subfamily of the\n[Athabaskan](/wiki/Athabaskan_languages \"Athabaskan languages\") and\n[Dené–Yeniseian](/wiki/Den%C3%A9%E2%80%93Yeniseian_languages \"Dené–Yeniseian\nlanguages\") families. Mescalero is part of the southwestern branch of this\nsubfamily; it is very closely related to [Chiricahua](/wiki/Chiricahua\n\"Chiricahua\"), and more distantly related to [Western\nApache](/wiki/Western_Apache \"Western Apache\"). These are considered the three\ndialects of Apachean. Although Navajo is a related Southern Athabaskan\nlanguage, its language and culture are considered distinct from those of the\nApache.\n\nThe Mescalero Apache were primarily a nomadic mountain people. They traveled\neast on the arid plains to hunt the buffalo and south into the desert for\ngathering [Mescal Agave](/wiki/Mescal_Agave \"Mescal Agave\"). Spanish colonists\nassociated them with this plant and named them Mescalero Apache. The Mescalero\nApache, along with the other Apache groups, lived by traditional hunting and\ngathering. If conditions were poor, they raided other tribes, and Spanish,\nMexican and American settlers to survive.\n\n## Origin of name[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mescalero&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Origin of name\")]\n\nThe Mescalero's autonym, or name for themselves, is _**Shis-Inday**_ (\"People\nof the Mountain Forests\") or _**Mashgalénde**_ (“People close to the\nmountains”).[7] The [Navajo](/wiki/Navajo_people \"Navajo people\"), another\n[Athabascan](/wiki/Athabaskan_languages \"Athabaskan languages\")-speaking\ntribe, call the Mescalero _**Naashgalí Dineʼé.**_[8] Like other Apache peoples\nthey often identify simply as _**Inday / Indee**_ (\"The People\"). Neighboring\nApache bands called the Mescalero _**Nadahéndé**_ (\"People of the Mescal\"),\nbecause the mescal agave (_[Agave parryi](/wiki/Agave_parryi \"Agave parryi\")_)\nwas a staple [food source](/wiki/Agave#Uses \"Agave\") for them. In times of\nneed and hunger, they depended on stored mescal for survival. Since 1550\nSpanish colonists referred to them as the _Mescalero._\n\nMescalero Apache bands were often referred to by European colonists and\nsettlers by different names, some related to their geographic territory. They\nwere recorded in documents by a wide number of names: _Apaches de Cuartelejo,\nApaches del Río Grande, Apachi, Faraones, Mezcaleros, Natage (more correctly,\none of the Lipan Apache subdivisions, along with the Nahizan), Natahene,\nQuerechos, Teyas, Tularosa Apaches, and Vaqueros._ They were also\ndistinguished as _Sierra Blanca Apaches, Sacramento Mountains Apaches,\nGuadalupe Mountains Apaches, Limpia Mountains Apaches._ according to their\nhomelands in northern or southern Mescalero territory.\n\n## Tribal territory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mescalero&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Tribal territory\")]\n\nOriginally the different Mescalero bands and local groups ranged in an area\nbetween the [Rio Grande](/wiki/Rio_Grande \"Rio Grande\") in the west and the\neastern and southern edge of the [Llano Estacado](/wiki/Llano_Estacado \"Llano\nEstacado\") and the southern [Texas Panhandle](/wiki/Texas_Panhandle \"Texas\nPanhandle\") in Texas in the east; from present-day [Santa\nFe](/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico \"Santa Fe, New Mexico\") in the northwest and\nthe [Texas Panhandle](/wiki/Texas_Panhandle \"Texas Panhandle\") in the\nnortheast, down to the [Big Bend](/wiki/Big_Bend_\\(Texas\\) \"Big Bend\n\\(Texas\\)\") of Texas and what became the Mexican provinces of Chihuahua and\nCoahuila to the south. The diverse landscape of this area has high mountains\nup to 12,000 feet, as well as watered and sheltered valleys, surrounded by\narid semi-deserts and deserts, deep canyons and open plains. The Mescalero\nApache Reservation is located at [geographical\ncoordinates](/wiki/Geographical_coordinates \"Geographical coordinates\")\n[33°10′42″N 105°36′44″W﻿ / ﻿33.17833°N 105.61222°W﻿ / 33.17833;\n-105.61222](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Mescalero&params=33_10_42_N_105_36_44_W_scale:500000).\n\nSince each band of Mescalero had the right to use the resources of deer and\nplants of the neighboring groups, the different bands felt at home in any area\nof their wide tribal territory. The Mescalero bands often ranged widely for\nhunting, gathering, warring and raiding. They called their home **Indeislun\nNakah** (\"people, forming a group, when they are there,\" \"place where people\nget together\"). When many Mescalero bands were displaced by the enemy\n[Comanche](/wiki/Comanche \"Comanche\") from the Southern Plains in northern and\ncentral Texas between 1700–1750, they took refuge in the mountains of New\nMexico, western Texas, and Coahuila and Chihuahua in Mexico. Some southern\nMescalero bands, together with Lipan, lived in the [Bolsón de\nMapimí](/wiki/Bols%C3%B3n_de_Mapim%C3%AD \"Bolsón de Mapimí\"), moving between\nthe [Nazas River](/wiki/Nazas_River \"Nazas River\"), the [Conchos\nRiver](/wiki/Conchos_River \"Conchos River\") and the [Rio\nGrande](/wiki/Rio_Grande \"Rio Grande\") to the north.\n\n## Bands[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mescalero&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Bands\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Mescalero%2C_Painted_boy.jpg/220px-\nMescalero%2C_Painted_boy.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mescalero,_Painted_boy.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mescalero,_Painted_boy.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMescalero painted boy; photo entitled _[Long Walk of the\nNavajo](/wiki/Long_Walk_of_the_Navajo \"Long Walk of the Navajo\")_.
