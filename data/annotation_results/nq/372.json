These\nwere also responsible for weaponising, systems engineering, aerodynamics,\nsafety interlocks and flight trials.[1] The bombs were transported in four\n[Indian Army](/wiki/Indian_Army \"Indian Army\") trucks under the command of\nColonel Umang Kapur; all devices from BARC were relocated at 3:00Hrs on 1 May\n1998. From the [Chhatrapati Shivaji International\nAirport](/wiki/Chhatrapati_Shivaji_International_Airport \"Chhatrapati Shivaji\nInternational Airport\"), the bombs were flown in an [Indian Air\nForce](/wiki/Indian_Air_Force \"Indian Air Force\")'s [AN-32](/wiki/AN-32\n\"AN-32\") plane to the Jaisalmer army base. They were transported to Pokhran in\nan army convoy of four trucks, and this required three trips. The devices were\ndelivered to the device preparation building, which was designated as 'Prayer\nHall'.[1]\n\nThe test sites was organised into two government groups and were fired\nseparately, with all devices in a group fired at the same time. The first\ngroup consisted of the thermonuclear device (_Shakti I_), the fission device\n(_Shakti II_), and a sub-kiloton device (_Shakti III_). The second group\nconsisted of the remaining two sub-kiloton devices _Shakti IV_ and _V_. It was\ndecided that the first group would be tested on 11 May and the second group on\n13 May. The thermonuclear device was placed in a shaft code named 'White\nHouse', which was over 200 m deep, the fission bomb was placed in a 150 m deep\nshaft code named 'Taj Mahal', and the first sub-kiloton device in\n'Kumbhkaran'. The first three devices were placed in their respective shafts\non 10 May, and the first device to be placed was the sub-kiloton device in the\n'Kumbhkaran' shaft, which was sealed by the army engineers by 8:30 pm. The\nthermonuclear device was lowered and sealed into the 'White House' shaft by 4\nam, and the fission device being placed in the 'Taj Mahal' shaft was sealed at\n7:30 am, which was 90 minutes before the planned test time. The shafts were\nL-shaped, with a horizontal chamber for the test device.[1]\n\nThe timing of the tests depended on the local weather conditions, with the\nwind being the critical factor. The tests were underground, but due to a\nnumber of shaft seal failures that had occurred during tests conducted by the\nUnited States, the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\"), and the\nUnited Kingdom, the sealing of the shaft could not be guaranteed to be leak-\nproof. By early afternoon, the winds had died down and the test sequence was\ninitiated. Dr. K. Santhanam of the DRDO, in charge of the test site\npreparations, gave the two keys that activated the test countdown to Dr. M.\nVasudev, the range safety officer, who was responsible for verifying that all\ntest indicators were normal. After checking the indicators, Vasudev handed one\nkey each to a representative of BARC and the DRDO, who unlocked the countdown\nsystem together. At 3:45 pm the three devices were detonated.[1]\n\n### Nuclear bombs and detonations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pokhran-\nII&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Nuclear bombs and detonations\")]\n\nFive nuclear devices were detonated during Operation Shakti.[15] All devices\nwere weapon-grade [plutonium](/wiki/Plutonium \"Plutonium\")[1] and they\nwere:[1]\n\n  * Shakti I – A [thermonuclear device](/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon \"Thermonuclear weapon\") yielding 45 kt, but designed for up to 200 kt.\n  * Shakti II – A [plutonium implosion](/wiki/Implosion-type_nuclear_weapon \"Implosion-type nuclear weapon\") design yielding 15 kt and intended as a warhead that could be delivered by bomber or missile. It was an improvement of the device detonated in the 1974 [Smiling Buddha](/wiki/Smiling_Buddha \"Smiling Buddha\") (Pokhran-I) test of 1974, developed using simulations on the [PARAM](/wiki/PARAM \"PARAM\") supercomputer.\n  * Shakti III – An experimental [linear implosion](/wiki/Implosion_nuclear_weapon \"Implosion nuclear weapon\") design that used \"non-[weapon grade](/wiki/Weapons-grade \"Weapons-grade\")\"[16] plutonium, but which likely omitted the material required for fusion, yielding 0.3 kt.\n  * Shakti IV- A 0.5 kt experimental device.\n  * Shakti V – A 0.2 kt experimental device.\n\nAn additional, sixth device (Shakti VI) is suspected to have been present but\nnot detonated.[1]\n\nAt 3:43 pm [IST](/wiki/Indian_Standard_Time \"Indian Standard Time\"); three\nnuclear bombs (specifically, the _Shakti I_ , II and III) were detonated\nsimultaneously, as measured by international seismic monitors.[5] On 13 May,\nat 12.21 p.m.IST 6:51 UTC, two sub-kiloton devices (_Shakti IV_ and V) were\ndetonated. Due to their very low yield, these explosions were not detected by\nany seismic station.[5] On 13 May 1998, India declared the series of tests to\nbe over after this.[17]\n\n## Reactions to the tests[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pokhran-\nII&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Reactions to the tests\")]\n\n### Reactions in India[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pokhran-\nII&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Reactions in India\")]\n\nFollowing the Pokhran-II tests, India became the sixth country to join the\n[nuclear club](/wiki/Nuclear_club \"Nuclear club\").[18] Shortly after the\ntests, a press meet was convened at the Prime Minister's residence in New\nDelhi. Prime Minister [Atal Bihari Vajpayee](/wiki/Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee \"Atal\nBihari Vajpayee\") appeared before the press corps and made the following short\nstatement:\n\n“ | Today, at 15:45 hours, India conducted three underground nuclear tests in the Pokhran range. The tests conducted today were with a fission device, a low yield device and a thermonuclear device. The measured yields are in line with expected values. Measurements have also confirmed that there was no release of radioactivity into the atmosphere. These were contained explosions like the experiment conducted in May 1974. I warmly congratulate the scientists and engineers who have carried out these successful tests.[19] | ”  \n---|---|---  \n  \nNews of the tests were greeted with jubilation and large-scale approval by\nsociety in India.[20] The [Bombay Stock Exchange](/wiki/Bombay_Stock_Exchange\n\"Bombay Stock Exchange\") registered significant gains. Newspapers and\ntelevision channels praised the government for its bold decision; editorials\nwere full of praise for the country's leadership and advocated the development\nof an operational nuclear arsenal for the country's armed forces.[20] The\nIndian opposition, led by [Congress Party](/wiki/Indian_National_Congress\n\"Indian National Congress\") criticised the [Vajpayee\nadministration](/wiki/Vajpayee_Government \"Vajpayee Government\") for carrying\nout the series of nuclear tests.[20] The Congress Party spokesman, [Salman\nKhursheed](/wiki/Salman_Khursheed \"Salman Khursheed\"), accused the\n[BJP](/wiki/Bharatiya_Janta_Party \"Bharatiya Janta Party\") of trying to use\nthe tests for political ends rather than to enhance the country's national\nsecurity.[20]\n\nBy the time India had conducted tests, the country had a total of $44bn in\nloans in 1998, from [IMF](/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund \"International\nMonetary Fund\") and the [World Bank](/wiki/World_Bank \"World Bank\").[21] The\nindustrial sectors of the Indian economy such as the chemicals industry, were\nlikely to be hurt by sanctions.[21] The Western consortium companies, which\nhas invested heavily in India, especially in construction, computing and\ntelecoms, were generally the one who were harmed by the sanctions.[21] In\n1998, Indian government announced that it had already allowed for some\neconomic response and was willing to take the consequences.[21]\n\n### International reactions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pokhran-\nII&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: International reactions\")]\n\n#### United States[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pokhran-II&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: United States\")]\n\nThe United States issued a strong statement condemning India and promised that\n[sanctions](/wiki/Economic_sanctions \"Economic sanctions\") would follow. The\nAmerican [intelligence community](/wiki/US_intelligence_community \"US\nintelligence community\") was embarrassed as there had been \"a serious\nintelligence failure of the decade\" in detecting the preparations for the\ntest.[22]\n\nIn keeping with its preferred approach to [foreign\npolicy](/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_clinton_administration \"Foreign policy of\nthe clinton administration\") in [recent\ndecades](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_\\(1991%E2%80%93present\\) \"History\nof the United States \\(1991–present\\)\"), and in compliance with the [1994\nanti-proliferation law](/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-\nProliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons \"Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons\"), the United States imposed economic sanctions on India.[4] The\nsanctions on India consisted of cutting off all assistance to India except\nhumanitarian aid, banning the export of certain defence material and\ntechnologies, ending American credit and credit guarantees to India, and\nrequiring the US to oppose lending by international financial institutions to\nIndia.[23]\n\nFrom 1998–99, the United States held series of bilateral talks with India over\nthe issue of India becoming [party](/wiki/Party_\\(politics\\) \"Party\n\\(politics\\)\") of the [CTBT](/wiki/Comprehensive_Test_Ban_Treaty\n\"Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\") and [NPT](/wiki/Non-Proliferation_Treaty\n\"Non-Proliferation Treaty\").[24] In addition, the United States also made an\nunsuccessful attempt of holding talks regarding the [rollback](/wiki/Rollback\n\"Rollback\") of [India's nuclear program](/wiki/Indian_nuclear_programme\n\"Indian nuclear programme\").[25] India took a firm stand against the\n[CTBT](/wiki/Comprehensive_Test_Ban_Treaty \"Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\")\nand refusing to be signatory [party](/wiki/Party_\\(politics\\) \"Party\n\\(politics\\)\") of it despite under pressure by the [US\nPresident](/wiki/United_States_President \"United States President\") [Bill\nClinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\"), and noted the\n[treaty](/wiki/Comprehensive_Test_Ban_Treaty \"Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\")\nas it was not consistent with India's national security interest.[25]\n\n#### Canada, Japan, and other states[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pokhran-\nII&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Canada, Japan, and other states\")]\n\nStrong criticism was drawn from Canada on India's actions and its [High\nCommissioner](/wiki/List_of_Ambassadors_and_High_Commissioners_of_Canada \"List\nof Ambassadors and High Commissioners of Canada\").[26]\n[Sanctions](/wiki/Economic_sanctions \"Economic sanctions\") were also imposed\nby Japan on India and consisted of freezing all new loans and grants except\nfor humanitarian aid to India.[27]\n\nSome other nations also imposed sanctions on India, primarily in the form of\nsuspension of [foreign aid](/wiki/Category:Foreign_aid_to_India\n\"Category:Foreign aid to India\") to India and government-to-government credit\nlines.[28] However, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia refrained from\ncondemning India.[28]\n\n#### China[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pokhran-II&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: China\")]\n\nOn 12 May the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated: \"The Chinese government is\nseriously concerned about the nuclear tests conducted by India,\" and that the\ntests \"run counter to the current international trend and are not conducive to\npeace and stability in South Asia.\".[29] The next day the [Chinese Foreign\nMinistry](/wiki/Chinese_Foreign_Ministry \"Chinese Foreign Ministry\") issued\nthe statement clearly stating that \"it shocked and strongly condemned\" the\nIndian nuclear tests and called for the international community to \"adopt a\nunified stand and strongly demand that India immediate stop development of\nnuclear weapons\".[30] China further rejected India's stated rationale of\nneeding nuclear capabilities to counter a Chinese threat as \"totally\nunreasonable\".[30] In a meeting with [Masayoshi\nTakemura](/wiki/Masayoshi_Takemura \"Masayoshi Takemura\") of [Democratic Party\nof Japan](/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan \"Democratic Party of Japan\"),\n[Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of\nChina](/wiki/Foreign_Minister_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China \"Foreign\nMinister of the People's Republic of China\") [Qian Qichen](/wiki/Qian_Qichen\n\"Qian Qichen\") was quoted as saying that India's nuclear tests were a \"serious\nmatter,\" particularly because they were conducted in light of the fact that\nmore than 140 countries have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \"It is\neven more unacceptable that India claims to have conducted the tests to\ncounter what it called a _\" China threat_\".[30] On 24 November 1998, the\n[Chinese Embassy, New\nDelhi](/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China\n\"List of diplomatic missions of the People's Republic of China\") issued a\nformal statement:\n\n> (sic)....

According to the\nPakistan's [science community](/wiki/Pakistan_Academy_of_Sciences \"Pakistan\nAcademy of Sciences\"), the Indian nuclear tests gave an opportunity to\nPakistan to conduct nuclear tests after 14 years of conducting only cold tests\n(See: [Kirana-I](/wiki/Kirana-I \"Kirana-I\")).[36]\n\nPakistan's leading [nuclear physicist](/wiki/Nuclear_physicist \"Nuclear\nphysicist\") and one of the top scientists, Dr. [Pervez\nHoodbhoy](/wiki/Pervez_Hoodbhoy \"Pervez Hoodbhoy\"), held India responsible for\nPakistan's nuclear test experiments in Chagai.[37]\n\n### U.N. sanctions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pokhran-II&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: U.N. sanctions\")]\n\nMain article: [United Nations Security Council Resolution\n1172](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1172 \"United Nations\nSecurity Council Resolution 1172\")\n\nThe reactions from abroad started immediately after the tests were advertised.\nOn 6 June, the [United Nations Security\nCouncil](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council \"United Nations Security\nCouncil\") adopted [_Resolution\n1172_](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1172 \"United Nations\nSecurity Council Resolution 1172\") condemning the test and that of\nPakistan's.[38] China issued a vociferous condemnation calling upon the\ninternational community to exert pressure on India to sign the NPT and\neliminate its nuclear arsenal. With India joining the group of countries\npossessing nuclear weapons, a new strategic dimension had emerged in Asia,\nparticularly South Asia.[38]\n\n#### Effects on Indian economy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pokhran-\nII&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Effects on Indian economy\")]\n\nOverall, the effect of [international sanctions](/wiki/International_sanctions\n\"International sanctions\") on [Indian economy](/wiki/Economy_of_India \"Economy\nof India\") was minimal; the technological progress was marginal. Most nations\ndid not call for [embargoes](/wiki/Embargoes \"Embargoes\") against India as the\nexports and imports together constituted only 4.0% of its\n[GDP](/wiki/Gross_domestic_product \"Gross domestic product\"), with United\nStates trade accounting for only 10.0% of this total.
