The story itself was based in the [Kingdom of\nNaples](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples \"Kingdom of Naples\"), at that time the most\nimportant political and cultural center of [Southern\nItaly](/wiki/Southern_Italy \"Southern Italy\") and among the most influential\ncapitals in Europe, and written in the [Neapolitan\ndialect](/wiki/Neapolitan_Language \"Neapolitan Language\"). It was later\nretold, along with other Basile tales, by [Charles\nPerrault](/wiki/Charles_Perrault \"Charles Perrault\") in _[Histoires ou contes\ndu temps passé](/wiki/Histoires_ou_contes_du_temps_pass%C3%A9 \"Histoires ou\ncontes du temps passé\")_ (1697),[4] and by the [Brothers\nGrimm](/wiki/Brothers_Grimm \"Brothers Grimm\") in their folk tale collection\n_[Grimms' Fairy Tales](/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\")_\n(1812).\n\nThe name \"Cenerentola\" comes from the Italian word \"cenere\" – tchenere (ash –\ncinder). It has to do with the fact that servants and scullions were usually\nsoiled with ash at that time, because of their cleaning work and also because\nthey had to live in cold basements so they usually tried to get warm by\nsitting close to the fireplace.\n\n### _Cenerentola_ , by\nBasile[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cinderella&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Cenerentola, by Basile\")]\n\n[Giambattista Basile](/wiki/Giambattista_Basile \"Giambattista Basile\"), an\nItalian soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales\ninto a written collection titled _Lo cunto de li cunti_ (The Story of\nStories), or _[Pentamerone](/wiki/Pentamerone \"Pentamerone\")_. It included the\ntale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters,\nmagical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the\nowner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634.\n\n**Plot:**\n\n    A prince has a daughter, Zezolla (tonnie) (the Cinderella figure), who is tended by a beloved governess. The governess, with Zezolla's help, persuades the prince to marry her. The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla (tonnie), and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes to the island of Sinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her: a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king hosts a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is. Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants. The third time, the king's servant captures one of her slippers. The king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a shoe-test, identifies Zezolla (tonnie) after the shoe jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually marries her.[14]\n\n### _Cendrillon_ , by\nPerrault[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cinderella&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Cendrillon, by Perrault\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Cinderella_-\n_Project_Gutenberg_etext_19993.jpg/220px-Cinderella_-\n_Project_Gutenberg_etext_19993.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cinderella_-\n_Project_Gutenberg_etext_19993.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cinderella_-_Project_Gutenberg_etext_19993.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Oliver Herford](/wiki/Oliver_Herford \"Oliver Herford\") illustrated\n_Cinderella with the Fairy Godmother_ , inspired by Perrault's version.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Cindarella_illustration_by_Charles_Robinson_1900.jpg/220px-\nCindarella_illustration_by_Charles_Robinson_1900.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cindarella_illustration_by_Charles_Robinson_1900.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cindarella_illustration_by_Charles_Robinson_1900.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Charles Robinson](/wiki/Charles_Robinson_\\(illustrator\\) \"Charles Robinson\n\\(illustrator\\)\") illustrated _Cinderella in the kitchen_ (1900), from \"Tales\nof Passed Times\" with stories by Charles Perrault.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Bodleian_Libraries%2C_Cinderella_or_The_little_glass_slipper-\n_Little_glass_slipper.jpg/220px-\nBodleian_Libraries%2C_Cinderella_or_The_little_glass_slipper-\n_Little_glass_slipper.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bodleian_Libraries,_Cinderella_or_The_little_glass_slipper-\n_Little_glass_slipper.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bodleian_Libraries,_Cinderella_or_The_little_glass_slipper-\n_Little_glass_slipper.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWriting blank entitled _Cinderella or The little glass slipper_ , educational\nfolder.\n\nOne of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by\n[Charles Perrault](/wiki/Charles_Perrault \"Charles Perrault\") in 1697, under\nthe name _Cendrillon_. The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to\nthe story, including the [pumpkin](/wiki/Pumpkin \"Pumpkin\"), the fairy-\ngodmother and the introduction of \"glass\" slippers.[15]\n\n**Plot:**\n\n    A wealthy widower marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two [daughters](/wiki/False_hero \"False hero\"), who are equally vain and selfish. The gentleman has a beautiful young daughter, a girl of unparalleled kindness and sweet temper. The man's daughter is forced into servitude, where she is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After the girl's chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in cinders, giving rise to the mocking nickname \"Cinderella\" by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her.\n    One day, the Prince invites all the young ladies in the land to a [royal ball](/wiki/Ball_\\(dance\\) \"Ball \\(dance\\)\"), planning to choose a wife. The two [stepsisters](/wiki/Step_family \"Step family\") gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids are not invited to the ball.\n    As the sisters depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her [Fairy Godmother](/wiki/Fairy_godmother \"Fairy godmother\") magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a [pumpkin](/wiki/Pumpkin \"Pumpkin\") into a golden carriage, [mice](/wiki/Mouse \"Mouse\") into [horses](/wiki/Horse \"Horse\"), a [rat](/wiki/Rat \"Rat\") into a [coachman](/wiki/Coachman \"Coachman\"), and [lizards](/wiki/Lizard \"Lizard\") into [footmen](/wiki/Footman \"Footman\"). She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before [midnight](/wiki/Midnight \"Midnight\"), when the [spells](/wiki/Magic_\\(paranormal\\) \"Magic \\(paranormal\\)\") will be broken.\n    At the ball, the entire [court](/wiki/Noble_court \"Noble court\") is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Godmother. She then greets the stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.\n    Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Godmother's help. The Prince has become even more infatuated, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The Prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken.\n    The Prince tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the Prince arrives at Cinderella's home, the stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella's stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees.\n    Cinderella married the Prince as her stepsisters are married to two handsome gentlemen of the royal court.\n\nThe first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is\npriceless. Without it, nothing is possible; with it, one can do anything.[16]\n\nHowever, the second moral of the story mitigates the first one and reveals the\ncriticism that Perrault is aiming at: That \"without doubt it is a great\nadvantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense.\nThese, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them.\nHowever, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a\ngodfather or a godmother.\"[16]\n\n### _Aschenputtel_ , by the Brothers\nGrimm[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cinderella&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Aschenputtel, by the Brothers Grimm\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Aschenputtel.jpg/220px-\nAschenputtel.jpg)](/wiki/File:Aschenputtel.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Aschenputtel.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Alexander Zick](/wiki/Alexander_Zick \"Alexander Zick\") illustrated\n_Cinderella with the doves_ , inspired by the Grimms' version.\n\nAnother well-known version was recorded by the German brothers [Jacob and\nWilhelm Grimm](/wiki/Brothers_Grimm \"Brothers Grimm\") in the 19th century. The\ntale is called _\" Aschenputtel\"_ (_\" Cinderella\"_ in English translations).\nThis version is much more intense than that of Perrault and Disney, in that\nCinderella's father did not die and the stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit\nin the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother, but rather help comes from\na wishing tree that the heroine planted on her mother's grave. The stepsisters\nsuffer a terrible punishment for their cruelty.\n\n**Plot:**\n\n    A plague infests a village, and a wealthy gentleman's wife lies on her deathbed. She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Ashfool\"). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk. The cruel sisters will do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and will always go to her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.\n\n    One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird will always comes to her. She will tell her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird will throw down to her what she has wished for.\n\n    The king decides to ordain a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in the land to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival, if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplishes the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sings a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.\n\n    The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the pigeon coop. The father has come home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince falls in love with her and dances with her for the whole day, and when sunset comes, the prince tries to accompany her home again. However, she climbs a pear tree to escape him. The Prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel has disappeared. The third day, she appears dressed in the grandest with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel loses track of time, and when she runs away one of her golden slippers sticks on that pitch. The prince proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.\n\n    The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. The sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes in order to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two doves from Heaven tell the Prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cuts off part of her heel in order to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that they keep a kitchen-maid in the house – omitting to mention that she is his own daughter – and the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing herself, and when she puts on the slipper, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the ball.\n\n    In the end, during Aschenputtel's wedding, as she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, (they had hoped to worm their way into her favour), the doves fly down and strike the two stepsisters' eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. When the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her prince march out of the church, the doves fly again, striking the remaining eyes of the two evil sisters blind, a punishment they had to endure for the rest of their lives.[17]\n\nAschenputtel's relationship with her father in this version is ambiguous;\n[Perrault](/wiki/Charles_Perrault \"Charles Perrault\")'s version states that\nthe absent father is dominated by his second wife, explaining why he does not\nprevent the abuse of his daughter. However, the father in this tale plays an\nactive role in several scenes, and it is not explained why he tolerates the\nmistreatment of his child. He also describes Aschenputtel as his \"first wife's\nchild\" and not his own.\n\n## Plot variations and alternative\ntellings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cinderella&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Plot variations and alternative tellings\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Edward_Burne-\nJones_Cinderella.jpg/220px-Edward_Burne-\nJones_Cinderella.jpg)](/wiki/File:Edward_Burne-Jones_Cinderella.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Edward_Burne-Jones_Cinderella.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Cinderella_ by [Edward Burne-Jones](/wiki/Edward_Burne-Jones \"Edward Burne-\nJones\"), 1863, [Museum of Fine Arts, Boston](/wiki/Museum_of_Fine_Arts,_Boston\n\"Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\")\n\n**Villains:** In some versions, her father plays an active role in the\nhumiliation of his daughter; in others, he is secondary to his new wife,\nCinderella's stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular [Disney\nfilm](/wiki/Cinderella_\\(1950_film\\) \"Cinderella \\(1950 film\\)\"), Cinderella's\nfather has died and Cinderella's mother has died also.\n\nAlthough many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the\ndefining trait of type [510A](/wiki/Antti_Aarne \"Antti Aarne\") is a female\npersecutor: in _[Fair, Brown and Trembling](/wiki/Fair,_Brown_and_Trembling\n\"Fair, Brown and Trembling\")_ and _[Finette Cendron](/wiki/Finette_Cendron\n\"Finette Cendron\")_ , the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the\nolder sisters who confine her to the kitchen. In other fairy tales featuring\nthe ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually\nbecause he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are _[Cap O'\nRushes](/wiki/Cap_O%27_Rushes \"Cap O' Rushes\")_, _[Catskin](/wiki/Catskin\n\"Catskin\")_ , All-Kinds-of-Fur, and _[Allerleirauh](/wiki/Allerleirauh\n\"Allerleirauh\")_ , and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job\nthere.[18] In _[Katie Woodencloak](/wiki/Katie_Woodencloak \"Katie\nWoodencloak\")_ , the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds\nsuch a job.\n\nIn _[La Cenerentola](/wiki/La_Cenerentola \"La Cenerentola\")_ , [Gioachino\nRossini](/wiki/Gioachino_Rossini \"Gioachino Rossini\") inverted the sex roles:\nCenerentola is oppressed by her [stepfather](/wiki/Stepfamily#stepfathers\n\"Stepfamily\"). (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made\nthe economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico\nwishes to make his own daughters' [dowries](/wiki/Dowry \"Dowry\") larger, to\nattract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry.\nFolklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and\nstepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the\ntale make it clear.[19]\n\n**Ball, Ballgown, and Curfew:** The number of balls varies, sometimes one,\nsometimes two, and sometimes three. The [fairy\ngodmother](/wiki/Fairy_godmother \"Fairy godmother\") is Perrault's own addition\nto the tale.[20] The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the\n[Grimms](/wiki/Brothers_Grimm \"Brothers Grimm\")'s version is her dead mother.\nAschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is\ngrowing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs\nfor the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such\nas _The Cinder Maid_ , collected by [Joseph Jacobs](/wiki/Joseph_Jacobs\n\"Joseph Jacobs\"), and the Finnish _[The Wonderful\nBirch](/wiki/The_Wonderful_Birch \"The Wonderful Birch\")_. Playwright [James\nLapine](/wiki/James_Lapine \"James Lapine\") incorporated this motif into the\nCinderella plotline of the musical _[Into the Woods](/wiki/Into_the_Woods\n\"Into the Woods\")_. [Giambattista Basile](/wiki/Giambattista_Basile\n\"Giambattista Basile\")'s _[Cenerentola](/wiki/Cenerentola \"Cenerentola\")_\ncombined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her\nto the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a\ntree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking\nanimals, as in _[Katie Woodencloak](/wiki/Katie_Woodencloak \"Katie\nWoodencloak\")_ , _[Rushen Coatie](/wiki/Rushen_Coatie \"Rushen Coatie\")_ ,\n_[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah](/wiki/Bawang_Putih_Bawang_Merah \"Bawang Putih\nBawang Merah\")_ , _[The Story of Tam and Cam](/wiki/The_Story_of_Tam_and_Cam\n\"The Story of Tam and Cam\")_ , or _[The Sharp Grey\nSheep](/wiki/The_Sharp_Grey_Sheep \"The Sharp Grey Sheep\")_ —these animals\noften having some connection with her dead mother; in _[The Golden\nSlipper](/wiki/The_Golden_Slipper \"The Golden Slipper\")_ , a fish aids her\nafter she puts it in water. In \"The Anklet\", it's a magical alabaster pot the\ngirl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets\nshe wears to the ball. [Gioachino Rossini](/wiki/Gioachino_Rossini \"Gioachino\nRossini\"), having agreed to do an opera based on _Cinderella_ if he could omit\nall magical elements, wrote _[La Cenerentola](/wiki/La_Cenerentola \"La\nCenerentola\")_ , in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly\nthe Prince's tutor.\n\nThe midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the\nball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply\ntired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired,\nhiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude\nher pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she\nescapes.[21]\n\nFurthermore, the gathering need not be a ball; several variants on Cinderella,\nsuch as _Katie Woodencloak_ and _The Golden Slipper_ have her attend church.\n\nIn the three-ball version, Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the\nfirst two nights and is able to leave without difficulty. However, on the\n[third](/wiki/Rule_of_three_\\(writing\\) \"Rule of three \\(writing\\)\") (or only)\nnight, she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her\ndisguise vanishes. In her haste, she loses a glass slipper which the prince\nfinds—or else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred, so as to catch\nher, and the slipper is caught in it.\n\n**The identifying item:** The glass slipper is unique to [Charles\nPerrault](/wiki/Charles_Perrault \"Charles Perrault\")'s version and its\nderivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials\n(in the version recorded by the [Brothers Grimm](/wiki/Brothers_Grimm\n\"Brothers Grimm\"), [German](/wiki/German_language \"German language\"):\n_Aschenbroedel_ and _Aschenputtel_ , for instance, it is gold) and in still\nother tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that\ngives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity. In Rossini's opera \"_[La\nCenerentola](/wiki/La_Cenerentola \"La Cenerentola\")_ \" (\"Cinderella\"), the\nslipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish\nvariant _[The Wonderful Birch](/wiki/The_Wonderful_Birch \"The Wonderful\nBirch\")_ the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring,\na circlet, and a pair of slippers. Interpreters unaware of the value attached\nto glass in 17th century France and perhaps troubled by sartorial\nimpracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's \"glass slipper\" (_pantoufle\nde verre_) had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (_pantoufle de vair_) in some\nunidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his\nsources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper\nwas a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part.[22] The [1950\nDisney adaptation](/wiki/Cinderella_\\(1950_film\\) \"Cinderella \\(1950 film\\)\")\ntakes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the\nslipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on,\nleaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity.\n\nAnother interpretation of verre/vair (glass/fur) suggested a sexual\nelement—the Prince was 'trying on' the 'fur slipper' (vagina) of the maidens\nin the kingdom, as a '[Droit du seigneur](/wiki/Droit_du_seigneur \"Droit du\nseigneur\")' right of sexual possession of his subjects. The disguised\nCinderella's 'fur slipper' was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her\nthereafter through sexual congress (a variety of sources including Joan\nGould).\n\nThe translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty\nhas left the significance of Cinderella's shoe size unclear, and resulted in\nthe implausibility of Cinderella's feet being of a unique size for no\nparticular reason. Humorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of\nhaving the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable, such as\nan amorous old crone. In [Terry Pratchett](/wiki/Terry_Pratchett \"Terry\nPratchett\")'s _[Witches Abroad](/wiki/Witches_Abroad \"Witches Abroad\")_ , the\nwitches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a\ncommon shoe size, and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if\nshe already knew where she was and went straight to her. In \"When the Clock\nStrikes\" (from _[Red As\nBlood](/w/index.php?title=Red_As_Blood&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Red As Blood\n\\(page does not exist\\)\")_), [Tanith Lee](/wiki/Tanith_Lee \"Tanith Lee\") had\nthe sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on, so it\nwould not fit.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Gustave_dore_cendrillon4.JPG/220px-\nGustave_dore_cendrillon4.JPG)](/wiki/File:Gustave_dore_cendrillon4.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gustave_dore_cendrillon4.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nCinderella tries on the slipper\n\n**The Revelation:** Cinderella's stepmother and [stepsisters](/wiki/False_hero\n\"False hero\") (in some versions just the stepsisters and, in some other\nversions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince's hand for\none of them. In the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper\nby cutting off a toe, but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the\nblood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother.\nThe second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the\nsame doves give her away.\n\nIn many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not\npossibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged. Often, this is said by\nthe stepmother or stepsisters. In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and\nthe father urge it.[23] The prince nevertheless insists on her trying.\nCinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or\nother item (in some cases she has kept the other).\n\n**The Conclusion:** In the German version of the story, the evil stepsisters\nare punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds. In\nother versions, they are forgiven, and made ladies-in-waiting with marriages\nto lesser lords.\n\nIn [The Thousand Nights and A\nNight](/wiki/The_Book_of_One_Thousand_and_One_Nights \"The Book of One Thousand\nand One Nights\"), in a tale called \"The Anklet\",[24] the stepsisters make a\ncomeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her\nwedding night. In _[The Wonderful Birch](/wiki/The_Wonderful_Birch \"The\nWonderful Birch\")_ , the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her\ndaughter for the true bride after she has given birth. Such tales continue the\nfairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.\n\nIn an episode of [Jim Henson](/wiki/Jim_Henson \"Jim Henson\")'s _[The\nStoryteller](/wiki/The_Storyteller_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Storyteller \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ , writer [Anthony Minghella](/wiki/Anthony_Minghella \"Anthony\nMinghella\") merged the old folk tale _[Donkeyskin](/wiki/Donkeyskin\n\"Donkeyskin\")_ (also written by Perrault) with _Cinderella_ to tell the tale\nof _Sapsorrow_ , a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny.\n\nMany popular new works based on the story feature one step-sister who is not\nas cruel to Cinderella as the other. Examples are the film _Ever After_ ,\n_Cinderella 3_ and the Broadway revival.\n\n## Folkloristics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cinderella&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Folkloristics\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Cendrillon2_crop.jpg/220px-\nCendrillon2_crop.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cendrillon2_crop.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cendrillon2_crop.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCinderella or Cendrillon in French.
