Philip Sherburne of _[Spin](/wiki/Spin_\\(magazine\\) \"Spin\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ noted a lack of notability of Walser compared to\n[Avicii](/wiki/Avicii \"Avicii\"), [Calvin Harris](/wiki/Calvin_Harris \"Calvin\nHarris\"), [Skrillex](/wiki/Skrillex \"Skrillex\"), and [Swedish House\nMafia](/wiki/Swedish_House_Mafia \"Swedish House Mafia\"), as they were also\nnominated for the same award, writing that the song's \"clunky rock/trance\nfusion and low-budget video make [Rebecca Black](/wiki/Rebecca_Black \"Rebecca\nBlack\")'s '[Friday](/wiki/Friday_\\(Rebecca_Black_song\\) \"Friday \\(Rebecca\nBlack song\\)\")' sound and look cutting-edge in comparison\".[1] Bill Freimuth,\nthe vice president of the [Recording\nAcademy](/wiki/National_Academy_of_Recording_Arts_and_Sciences \"National\nAcademy of Recording Arts and Sciences\") – which is responsible for the Grammy\nAwards – told [MTV](/wiki/MTV \"MTV\") Walser \"was a very active marketer of his\nwork, and got his music out to lots and lots of our voting membership, and\nthey chose to vote for it.\" He noted that ballot is [audited](/wiki/Audit\n\"Audit\") by [Deloitte](/wiki/Deloitte \"Deloitte\") and said \"they found nothing\nreally anomalous or wrong with the votes surrounding this nomination.\"[2]\n\nSpeculation surrounding the nomination includes Walser's membership to the\nRecording Academy. Walser stated his position as a voter \"was only helpful to\nthe extent that I had access to the other voters, and they could see what I\nwas doing on a regular basis\".[3] [_Billboard_](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\") compared the incident to [Linda\nChorney](/wiki/Linda_Chorney \"Linda Chorney\"), who gained a Grammy Award\nnomination the previous year through a similar tactic.[4]\n\n## Track\nlisting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Live_Without_You&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Track listing\")]\n\nDigital download[5]\n\n  1. \"I Can't Live Without You\" (Maui & Chris Mix) – 3:19\n  2. \"I Can't Live Without You\" (Malibu Mix) – 3:15\n  3. \"I Can't Live Without You\" (Turnyboy Mix) – 3:29\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=I_Can%27t_Live_Without_You&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Sherburne, Philip (December 6, 2012).
