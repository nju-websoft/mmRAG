[Edmund\nRandolph](/wiki/Edmund_Randolph \"Edmund Randolph\")'s [Virginia\nPlan](/wiki/Virginia_Plan \"Virginia Plan\") called for a\n[bicameral](/wiki/Bicameralism \"Bicameralism\") Congress: the lower house would\nbe \"of the people\", elected directly by the people of the United States and\nrepresenting [public opinion](/wiki/Public_opinion \"Public opinion\"), and a\nmore deliberative upper house that would represent the individual states, and\nwould be less susceptible to variations of mass sentiment, would be elected by\nthe lower house.[6]\n\nThe House is referred to as the [lower house](/wiki/Lower_house \"Lower\nhouse\"), with the Senate being the [upper house](/wiki/Upper_house \"Upper\nhouse\"), although the [United States\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\")\ndoes not use that terminology. Both houses' approval is necessary for the\npassage of [legislation](/wiki/Legislation \"Legislation\"). The Virginia Plan\ndrew the support of delegates from large states such as\n[Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\"), [Massachusetts](/wiki/Massachusetts\n\"Massachusetts\"), and [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"), as it\ncalled for representation based on population. The smaller states, however,\nfavored the [New Jersey Plan](/wiki/New_Jersey_Plan \"New Jersey Plan\"), which\ncalled for a unicameral Congress with equal representation for the states.[6]\n\nEventually, the Convention reached the [Connecticut\nCompromise](/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise \"Connecticut Compromise\") or Great\nCompromise, under which one house of Congress (the House of Representatives)\nwould provide representation proportional to each state's population, whereas\nthe other (the Senate) would provide equal representation amongst the\nstates.[6] The Constitution was ratified by the requisite number of states\n(nine out of the 13) in 1788, but its implementation was set for March 4,\n1789. The House began work on April 1, 1789, when it achieved a\n[quorum](/wiki/Quorum \"Quorum\") for the first time.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the House was frequently in\nconflict with the Senate over regionally divisive issues, including\n[slavery](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States \"Slavery in the United States\").\nThe [North](/wiki/Northeastern_United_States \"Northeastern United States\") was\nmuch more populous than the\n[South](/wiki/History_of_the_Southern_United_States \"History of the Southern\nUnited States\"), and therefore dominated the House of Representatives.\nHowever, the North held no such advantage in the Senate, where the equal\nrepresentation of states prevailed.\n\nRegional conflict was most pronounced over the issue of slavery. One example\nof a provision repeatedly supported by the House but blocked by the Senate was\nthe [Wilmot Proviso](/wiki/Wilmot_Proviso \"Wilmot Proviso\"), which sought to\nban slavery in the land gained during the [Mexican–American\nWar](/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War \"Mexican–American War\"). Conflict over\nslavery and other issues persisted until the [Civil\nWar](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") (1861–1865), which began\nsoon after several southern states attempted to [secede](/wiki/Secession\n\"Secession\") from the Union. The war culminated in the South's defeat and in\nthe abolition of slavery. All southern senators except [Andrew\nJohnson](/wiki/Andrew_Johnson \"Andrew Johnson\") resigned their seats at the\nbeginning of the war, and therefore the Senate did not hold the balance of\npower between North and South during the war.\n\nThe years of [Reconstruction](/wiki/Reconstruction_Era \"Reconstruction Era\")\nthat followed witnessed large majorities for the [Republican\nParty](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party \"History of the\nUnited States Republican Party\"), which many Americans associated with the\nUnion's victory in the Civil War and the ending of slavery. The Reconstruction\nperiod ended in about 1877; the ensuing era, known as the [Gilded\nAge](/wiki/Gilded_Age \"Gilded Age\"), was marked by sharp political divisions\nin the electorate. The [Democratic\nParty](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Democratic_Party \"History of the\nUnited States Democratic Party\") and Republican Party each held majorities in\nthe House at various times.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Thomas_Brackett_Reed_-\n_Brady-Handy.jpg/200px-Thomas_Brackett_Reed_-_Brady-\nHandy.jpg)](/wiki/File:Thomas_Brackett_Reed_-_Brady-Handy.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Thomas_Brackett_Reed_-_Brady-Handy.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party\n\\(United States\\)\") [Speaker of the\nHouse](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Speaker of\nthe United States House of Representatives\") [Thomas Brackett\nReed](/wiki/Thomas_Brackett_Reed \"Thomas Brackett Reed\") (1895–1899)\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw a dramatic increase in the\npower of the [Speaker of the\nHouse](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Speaker of\nthe United States House of Representatives\"). The rise of the Speaker's\ninfluence began in the 1890s, during the tenure of Republican [Thomas Brackett\nReed](/wiki/Thomas_Brackett_Reed \"Thomas Brackett Reed\"). \"[Czar](/wiki/Czar\n\"Czar\") Reed\", as he was nicknamed, attempted to put into effect his view that\n\"The best system is to have one party govern and the other party watch.\" The\nleadership structure of the House also developed during approximately the same\nperiod, with the positions of [Majority\nLeader](/wiki/Majority_Leader_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives\") and [Minority\nLeader](/wiki/Minority_leader_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives\") being created\nin 1899. While the Minority Leader was the head of the minority party, the\nMajority Leader remained subordinate to the Speaker. The Speakership reached\nits zenith during the term of Republican [Joseph Gurney\nCannon](/wiki/Joseph_Gurney_Cannon \"Joseph Gurney Cannon\"), from 1903 to 1911.\nThe powers of the Speaker included chairmanship of the influential [Rules\nCommittee](/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules \"United States House\nCommittee on Rules\") and the ability to appoint members of other House\ncommittees. These powers, however, were curtailed in the \"Revolution of 1910\"\nbecause of the efforts of Democrats and dissatisfied Republicans who opposed\nCannon's arguably heavy-handed tactics.\n\nThe Democratic Party dominated the House of Representatives during the\nadministration of President [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\") (1933–1945),\noften winning over two-thirds of the seats. Both Democrats and Republicans\nwere in power at various times during the next decade. The Democratic Party\nmaintained control of the House from 1955 until 1995. In the mid-1970s, there\nwere major reforms of the House, strengthening the power of sub-committees at\nthe expense of committee chairs and allowing party leaders to nominate\ncommittee chairs. These actions were taken to undermine the [seniority\nsystem](/wiki/Seniority_in_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Seniority in the United States House of Representatives\"), and to reduce the\nability of a small number of senior members to obstruct legislation they did\nnot favor. There was also a shift from the 1990s to greater control of the\nlegislative program by the majority party; the power of party leaders\n(especially the Speaker) grew considerably.\n\nThe Republicans [took control of the House](/wiki/Republican_Revolution\n\"Republican Revolution\") in 1995, under the leadership of Speaker [Newt\nGingrich](/wiki/Newt_Gingrich \"Newt Gingrich\"). Gingrich attempted to pass a\nmajor legislative program, the [Contract with\nAmerica](/wiki/Contract_with_America \"Contract with America\"), on which the\nHouse Republicans had been elected, and made major reforms of the House,\nnotably reducing the tenure of committee chairs to three two-year terms. Many\nelements of the Contract did not pass Congress, were vetoed by President [Bill\nClinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\"), or were substantially altered in\nnegotiations with Clinton. However, after Republicans held control in the 1996\nelection, Clinton and the Gingrich-led House agreed on the first balanced\nfederal budget in decades, along with a substantial tax cut.[7] The\nRepublicans held on to the House until 2006, when the Democrats won control\nand [Nancy Pelosi](/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi \"Nancy Pelosi\") was subsequently elected\nby the House as the first female Speaker. The Republicans retook the House in\n2011, with the largest shift of power since the 1930s.[8]\n\n## Membership, qualifications

the\nConstitution](/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#House_of_Representatives\n\"Article One of the United States Constitution\"), seats in the House of\nRepresentatives are\n[apportioned](/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment \"United States\ncongressional apportionment\") among the states by population, as determined by\nthe [census](/wiki/United_States_Census \"United States Census\") conducted\nevery ten years. Each state is entitled to at least one Representative,\nhowever small its population.\n\nThe only constitutional rule relating to the [size of the\nHouse](/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment \"United States\ncongressional apportionment\") states: \"The Number of Representatives shall not\nexceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one\nRepresentative.\"[9] Congress regularly increased the size of the House to\naccount for population growth until it fixed the number of voting House\nmembers at 435 in 1911.[1] In 1959, upon the admission of\n[Alaska](/wiki/Alaska \"Alaska\") and [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\"), the\nnumber was temporarily increased to 437 (seating one Representative from each\nof those states without changing existing apportionment), and returned to 435\nfour years later, after the reapportionment consequent to the [1960\ncensus](/wiki/United_States_Census,_1960 \"United States Census, 1960\").\n\nThe Constitution does not provide for the representation of the [District of\nColumbia](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\") or of\n[territories](/wiki/United_States_territory \"United States territory\"). The\n[District of Columbia](/wiki/District_of_Columbia_voting_rights \"District of\nColumbia voting rights\") and the territories of [Puerto\nRico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico \"Puerto Rico\"), [American Samoa](/wiki/American_Samoa\n\"American Samoa\"), [Guam](/wiki/Guam \"Guam\"), the [Northern Mariana\nIslands](/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands \"Northern Mariana Islands\"), and the\n[U.S. Virgin Islands](/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands \"United States Virgin\nIslands\") are each represented by one [non-voting\ndelegate](/wiki/Delegate_\\(United_States_Congress\\) \"Delegate \\(United States\nCongress\\)\"). Puerto Rico elects a [Resident\nCommissioner](/wiki/Resident_Commissioner_of_Puerto_Rico \"Resident\nCommissioner of Puerto Rico\"), but other than having a four-year term, the\nResident Commissioner's role is identical to the delegates from the other\nterritories.

This has been a federal statutory\nrequirement since 1967.[12] Prior to that law, [general\nticket](/wiki/General_ticket \"General ticket\") representation was used by some\nstates.\n\nStates typically [redraw district boundaries](/wiki/Redistricting\n\"Redistricting\") after each census, though they may do so at other times, such\nas the [2003 Texas redistricting](/wiki/2003_Texas_redistricting \"2003 Texas\nredistricting\"). Each state determines its own district boundaries, either\nthrough legislation or through non-partisan panels.\n\"[Malapportionment](/wiki/Malapportionment \"Malapportionment\")\" is\nunconstitutional and districts must be approximately equal in population (see\n_[Wesberry v. Sanders](/wiki/Wesberry_v._Sanders \"Wesberry v. Sanders\")_).\nAdditionally, Section 2 of the [Voting Rights Act of\n1965](/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965 \"Voting Rights Act of 1965\") prohibits\nredistricting plans that are intended to, or have the effect of,\ndiscriminating against racial or language minority voters.[13] Aside from\nmalapportionment and discrimination against racial or language minorities,\nfederal courts have allowed state legislatures to engage in\n[gerrymandering](/wiki/Gerrymandering \"Gerrymandering\") for the benefit of\npolitical parties or incumbents.[14][15] In a 1984 case, _[Davis v.\nBandemer](/wiki/Davis_v._Bandemer \"Davis v. Bandemer\")_ , the [Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United\nStates\") held that gerrymandered districts could be struck down on the basis\nof the [Equal Protection Clause](/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause \"Equal\nProtection Clause\"), but the Court did not articulate a standard for when\ndistricts are impermissibly gerrymandered. However, the Court overruled Davis\nin 2004 in _[Vieth v. Jubelirer](/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer \"Vieth v.\nJubelirer\")_ , and Court precedent currently holds gerrymandering to be a\n[political question](/wiki/Political_question \"Political question\"). According\nto calculations made by [Burt Neuborne](/wiki/Burt_Neuborne \"Burt Neuborne\")\nusing criteria set forth by the [American Political Science\nAssociation](/wiki/American_Political_Science_Association \"American Political\nScience Association\"), about 40 seats, less than 10% of the House membership,\nare chosen through a genuinely contested electoral process, given partisan\ngerrymandering.[16][17]\n\n###\nQualifications[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Qualifications\")]\n\nArticle I, Section 2 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for\nrepresentatives. Each representative must: (1) be at least twenty-five years\nold; (2) have been a [citizen](/wiki/United_States_nationality_law \"United\nStates nationality law\") of the United States for the past seven years; and\n(3) be (at the time of the election) an inhabitant of the state they\nrepresents. Members are not required to live in the districts they represent,\nbut they traditionally do.[18] The age and citizenship qualifications for\nrepresentatives are less than those for senators. The constitutional\nrequirements of Article I, Section 2 for election to Congress are the maximum\nrequirements that can be imposed on a candidate.[19] Therefore, Article I,\nSection 5, which permits each House to be the judge of the qualifications of\nits own members does not permit either House to establish additional\nqualifications. Likewise a State could not establish additional\nqualifications.\n\nDisqualification: under the [Fourteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), a federal or state\nofficer who takes the requisite oath to support the Constitution, but later\nengages in rebellion or aids the enemies of the United States, is disqualified\nfrom becoming a representative.

After a census is taken (in a\nyear ending in 0), the year ending in 2 is the first year in which elections\nfor U.S. House districts are based on that census (with the Congress based on\nthose districts starting its term on the following Jan. 3).\n\nIn most states, major party candidates for each district are nominated in\npartisan [primary elections](/wiki/Primary_election \"Primary election\"),\ntypically held in spring to late summer. In some states, the Republican and\nDemocratic parties choose their respective candidates for each district in\ntheir [political conventions](/wiki/Political_convention \"Political\nconvention\") in spring or early summer, which often use unanimous voice votes\nto reflect either confidence in the incumbent or the result of bargaining in\nearlier private discussions. Exceptions can result in so-called floor\nfight—convention votes by delegates, with outcomes that can be hard to\npredict. Especially if a convention is closely divided, a losing candidate may\ncontend further by meeting the conditions for a primary election.\n\nThe courts generally do not consider [ballot access](/wiki/Ballot_access\n\"Ballot access\") rules for [independent](/wiki/Independent_politician\n\"Independent politician\") and [third party](/wiki/Third_party_\\(politics\\)\n\"Third party \\(politics\\)\") candidates to be additional qualifications for\nholding office and there are no federal regulations regarding ballot access.\nAs a result, the process to gain ballot access varies greatly from state to\nstate, and in the case of a [third party](/wiki/Third_party_\\(politics\\)\n\"Third party \\(politics\\)\") may be affected by results of previous years'\nelections.\n\nIn 1967, the United States Congress passed the Uniform Congressional District\nAct, which requires almost all representatives be elected from single-member-\ndistricts.[20][21] Following the _[Wesberry v.\nSanders](/wiki/Wesberry_v._Sanders \"Wesberry v. Sanders\")_ decision, Congress\nwas motivated by fears that courts would impose [at-large plurality\ndistricts](/wiki/Plurality-at-large_voting \"Plurality-at-large voting\") on\nstates that did not redistrict to comply with the new mandates for districts\nroughly equal in population, and Congress also sought to prevent attempts by\nsouthern states to use such voting systems to dilute the vote of racial\nminorities.[22] Several states have used multi-member districts in the past,\nalthough only two states (Hawaii and New Mexico) used multi-member districts\nin 1967.[21] Hawaii and New Mexico were made exempt from the Uniform\nCongressional District Act, and are free to use multi-member districts,\nalthough neither state chooses to do so.[21]\n\n[Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\") is unique in that it holds an all-\nparty \"primary election\" on the general Election Day with a subsequent [run-\noff election](/wiki/Two-round_system \"Two-round system\") between the top two\nfinishers (regardless of party) if no candidate received a majority in the\nprimary. The states of [Washington](/wiki/Washington_\\(state\\) \"Washington\n\\(state\\)\") and [California](/wiki/California \"California\") now use a similar\n(though not identical) system to that used by Louisiana. Seats vacated during\na term are filled through special elections, unless the vacancy occurs closer\nto the next general election date than a pre-established deadline. The term of\na member chosen in a special election usually begins the next day, or as soon\nas the results are certified.\n\n### Non-voting\ndelegates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Non-voting delegates\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-\nnew.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg)|\nThis section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

The personnel allowance is the same for all members; the office and mail\nallowances vary based on the members' district's distance from Washington,\nD.C., the cost of office space in the member's district, and the number of\nnon-business addresses in their district. These three components are used to\ncalculate a single MRA that can fund any expense—even though each component is\ncalculated individually, the franking allowance can be used to pay for\npersonnel expenses if the member so chooses. In 2011 this allowance averaged\n$1.4 million per member, and ranged from $1.35 to $1.67 million.[34]\n\nThe Personnel allowance was $944,671 per member in 2010.

Instead, s/he delegates the responsibility of presiding to other\nmembers in most cases. The presiding officer sits in a chair in the front of\nthe House chamber. The powers of the presiding officer are extensive; one\nimportant power is that of controlling the order in which members of the House\nspeak. No member may make a speech or a motion unless s/he has first been\nrecognized by the presiding officer. Moreover, the presiding officer may rule\non a \"[point of order](/wiki/Point_of_order \"Point of order\")\" (a member's\nobjection that a rule has been breached); the decision is subject to appeal to\nthe whole House.\n\nSpeakers serve as chairs of their party's steering committee, which is\nresponsible for assigning party members to other House committees. The Speaker\nchooses the chairmen of standing committees, appoints most of the members of\nthe [Rules Committee](/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules \"United\nStates House Committee on Rules\"), appoints all members of conference\ncommittees, and determines which committees consider bills.\n\nEach party elects a [floor leader](/wiki/Floor_leader \"Floor leader\"), who is\nknown as the [Majority Leader](/wiki/Majority_Leader \"Majority Leader\") or\n[Minority Leader](/wiki/Minority_Leader \"Minority Leader\"). The Minority\nLeader heads their party in the House, and the Majority Leader is their\nparty's second-highest-ranking official, behind the Speaker. Party leaders\ndecide what legislation members of their party should either support or\noppose.\n\nEach party also elects a [Whip](/wiki/Whip_\\(politics\\) \"Whip \\(politics\\)\"),\nwho works to ensure that the party's members vote as the party leadership\ndesires. The [current majority\nwhip](/wiki/Assistant_Party_Leaders_of_the_United_States_House \"Assistant\nParty Leaders of the United States House\") in the House of Representatives is\n[Steve Scalise](/wiki/Steve_Scalise \"Steve Scalise\"), who is a member of the\n[Republican Party](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party\n\\(United States\\)\").

After the Democratic Caucus Chair is the Campaign\nCommittee Chair ([Democratic Congressional Campaign\nCommittee](/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee \"Democratic\nCongressional Campaign Committee\")), then the co-chairs of the Steering\nCommittee.

Some notable\nexamples include [Tip O'Neill](/wiki/Tip_O%27Neill \"Tip O'Neill\") in the\n1980s, [Newt Gingrich](/wiki/Newt_Gingrich \"Newt Gingrich\") in the 1990s, and\n[John Boehner](/wiki/John_Boehner \"John Boehner\") in the 2010s. Since the\nSpeaker is a partisan officer with substantial power to control the business\nof the House, the position is often used for partisan advantage.\n\nIn the instance when the Presidency and both Houses of Congress are controlled\nby one party, the Speaker normally takes a low profile and defers to the\nPresident. For that situation the House Minority Leader can play the role of a\n_de facto_ \"leader of the opposition\", often more so than the Senate Minority\nLeader, due to the more partisan nature of the House and the greater role of\nleadership.\n\n### Non-member\nofficials[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Non-member officials\")]\n\nThe House is also served by several officials who are not members.

Finally, routine police work is handled by the [United States\nCapitol Police](/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police \"United States Capitol\nPolice\"), which is supervised by the [Capitol Police\nBoard](/wiki/Capitol_Police_Board \"Capitol Police Board\"), a body to which the\nSergeant at Arms belongs, and chairs in even-numbered years.\n\n##\nProcedure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Procedure\")]\n\nMain article: [Procedures of the United States House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/Procedures_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Procedures of the United States House of Representatives\")\n\n### Daily\nprocedures[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Daily procedures\")]\n\nLike the Senate, the House of Representatives meets in the United States\nCapitol in Washington, D.C. At one end of the chamber of the House is a\n[rostrum](/wiki/Podium \"Podium\") from which the\n[Speaker](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Speaker\nof the United States House of Representatives\"), Speaker Pro Tempore, or (when\nin the Committee of the Whole) the Chair presides.[36] The lower tier of the\nrostrum is used by clerks and other officials. Members' seats are arranged in\nthe chamber in a semicircular pattern facing the rostrum and are divided by a\nwide central aisle.[37] By tradition, Democrats sit on the left of the center\naisle, while Republicans sit on the right, facing the presiding officer's\nchair.[38] Sittings are normally held on weekdays; meetings on Saturdays and\nSundays are rare. Sittings of the House are generally open to the public;\nvisitors must obtain a House Gallery pass from a congressional office.[39]\nSittings are broadcast live on television and have been streamed live on\n[C-SPAN](/wiki/C-SPAN \"C-SPAN\") since March 19, 1979,[40] and on _HouseLive_ ,\nthe official streaming service operated by the Clerk, since the early 2010s.\n\nThe procedure of the House depends not only on the rules, but also on a\nvariety of customs, precedents, and traditions. In many cases, the House\nwaives some of its stricter rules (including time limits on debates) by\n[unanimous consent](/wiki/Unanimous_consent \"Unanimous consent\").[41] A member\nmay block a unanimous consent agreement; in practice, objections are rare. The\npresiding officer, the [Speaker of the House](/wiki/Speaker_\\(politics\\)\n\"Speaker \\(politics\\)\") enforces the rules of the House, and may warn members\nwho deviate from them. The Speaker uses a [gavel](/wiki/Gavel \"Gavel\") to\nmaintain order.[42] The box in which legislation is placed to be considered by\nthe House is called the\n[hopper](/wiki/Clerk_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Clerk of\nthe United States House of Representatives\").[43]\n\nIn one of its first resolutions, the U.S. House of Representatives established\nthe [Office of the Sergeant at\nArms](/wiki/Sergeant_at_Arms_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives\"). In an\nAmerican tradition adopted from English custom in 1789 by the first Speaker of\nthe House, [Frederick Muhlenberg](/wiki/Frederick_Muhlenberg \"Frederick\nMuhlenberg\") of [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"), the [Mace\nof the United States House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/Mace_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives\n\"Mace of the United States House of Representatives\") is used to open all\nsessions of the House. It is also used during the inaugural ceremonies for all\nPresidents of the United States. For daily sessions of the House, the sergeant\nat Arms carries the mace in front of the Speaker in procession to the\n[rostrum](/wiki/Podium \"Podium\"). It is placed on a green marble pedestal to\nthe Speaker's right. When the House is in committee, the mace is moved to a\npedestal next to the desk of the Sergeant at Arms.[44]\n\nThe Constitution provides that a majority of the House constitutes a\n[quorum](/wiki/Quorum \"Quorum\") to do business.[45] Under the rules and\ncustoms of the House, a quorum is always assumed present unless a [quorum\ncall](/wiki/Quorum_call \"Quorum call\") explicitly demonstrates otherwise.\nHouse rules prevent a member from making a point of order that a quorum is not\npresent unless a question is being voted on. The presiding officer does not\naccept a point of order of no quorum during general debate, or when a question\nis not before the House.[46]\n\nDuring debates, a member may speak only if called upon by the presiding\nofficer. The presiding officer decides which members to recognize, and can\ntherefore control the course of debate.[47] All speeches must be addressed to\nthe presiding officer, using the words \"Mr. Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker\". Only\nthe presiding officer may be directly addressed in speeches; other members\nmust be referred to in the third person. In most cases, members do not refer\nto each other only by name, but also by state, using forms such as \"the\ngentleman from Virginia\", \"the distinguished gentlewoman from California\", or\n\"my distinguished friend from Alabama\".\n\nThere are 448 permanent seats on the House Floor and four tables, two on each\nside. These tables are occupied by members of the committee that have brought\na bill to the floor for consideration and by the respective party leadership.\nMembers address the House from microphones at any table or \"the well,\" the\narea immediately in front of the rostrum.[48]\n\n### Passage of\nlegislation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Passage of legislation\")]\n\nPer the constitution, the House determines the rules according to which it\npasses legislation. The rules are in principle open to change with each new\nCongress, but in practice each new session amends a standing set of rules\nbuilt up over the history of the body in an early resolution published for\npublic inspection.[49] Before legislation reaches the floor of the House, the\n[Rules Committee](/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules \"United States\nHouse Committee on Rules\") normally passes a rule to govern debate on that\nmeasure (which then must be passed by the full House before it becomes\neffective). For instance, the committee determines if amendments to the bill\nare permitted. An \"open rule\" permits all germane amendments, but a \"closed\nrule\" restricts or even prohibits amendment. Debate on a bill is generally\nrestricted to one hour, equally divided between the majority and minority\nparties. Each side is led during the debate by a \"floor manager\", who\nallocates debate time to members who wish to speak. On contentious matters,\nmany members may wish to speak; thus, a member may receive as little as one\nminute, or even thirty seconds, to make his/her point.[50]\n\nWhen debate concludes, the motion in question is put to a vote.[51] In many\ncases, the House votes by voice vote; the presiding officer puts the question,\nand members respond either \"yea\" or \"aye\" (in favor of the motion) or \"nay\" or\n\"no\" (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the result of\nthe voice vote. A member may however challenge the presiding officer's\nassessment and \"request the yeas and nays\" or \"request a recorded vote\". The\nrequest may be granted only if it is seconded by one-fifth of the members\npresent. In practice, however, members of congress second requests for\nrecorded votes as a matter of courtesy. Some votes are always recorded, such\nas those on the annual budget.[52]\n\nA recorded vote may be taken in one of three different ways. One is\nelectronically. Members use a personal identification card to record their\nvotes at 46 voting stations in the chamber. Votes are usually held in this\nway. A second mode of recorded vote is by teller. Members hand in colored\ncards to indicate their votes: green for \"yea\", red for \"nay\", and orange for\n\"present\" (i.e., to abstain). Teller votes are normally held only when\nelectronic voting breaks down. Finally, the House may conduct a [roll call\nvote](/wiki/Roll_call_vote \"Roll call vote\"). The Clerk reads the list of\nmembers of the House, each of whom announces their vote when their name is\ncalled. This procedure is only used rarely (such as for the election of a\nSpeaker) because of the time consumed by calling over four hundred names.[52]\n\nVoting traditionally lasts for, at most, fifteen minutes, but it may be\nextended if the leadership needs to \"whip\" more members into alignment.[52]\nThe 2003 vote on the prescription drug benefit was open for three hours, from\n3:00 to 6:00 a.m., to receive four additional votes, three of which were\nnecessary to pass the legislation.[53] The 2005 vote on the [Central American\nFree Trade Agreement](/wiki/Central_American_Free_Trade_Agreement \"Central\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement\") was open for one hour, from 11:00 p.m. to\nmidnight.[54] An October 2005 vote on facilitating refinery construction was\nkept open for forty minutes.[55]\n\nPresiding officers may vote like other members. They may not, however, vote\ntwice in the event of a tie; rather, a tie vote defeats the motion.[56]\n\n##\nCommittees[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Committees\")]\n\nFurther information: [United States congressional\ncommittee](/wiki/United_States_congressional_committee \"United States\ncongressional committee\") and [List of current United States House of\nRepresentatives\ncommittees](/wiki/List_of_current_United_States_House_of_Representatives_committees\n\"List of current United States House of Representatives committees\")\n\nThe House uses committees and their subcommittees for a variety of purposes,\nincluding the review of bills and the oversight of the executive branch. The\nappointment of committee members is formally made by the whole House, but the\nchoice of members is actually made by the political parties. Generally, each\nparty honors the preferences of individual members, giving priority on the\nbasis of seniority. Historically, membership on committees has been in rough\nproportion to the party's strength in the House as a whole, with two\nexceptions: on the Rules Committee, the majority party fills nine of the\nthirteen seats;[57] and on the Ethics Committee, each party has an equal\nnumber of seats.[58] However, when party control in the House is closely\ndivided, extra seats on committees are sometimes allocated to the majority\nparty. In the 109th Congress, for example, the Republicans controlled about\n53% of the House as a whole, but had 54% of the Appropriations Committee\nmembers, 55% of the members on the Energy and Commerce Committee, 58% of the\nmembers on the Judiciary Committee, and 69% of the members on the Rules\nCommittee.\n\nThe largest committee of the House is the [Committee of the\nWhole](/wiki/Committee_of_the_Whole_\\(United_States_House_of_Representatives\\)\n\"Committee of the Whole \\(United States House of Representatives\\)\"), which,\nas its name suggests, consists of all members of the House. The Committee\nmeets in the House chamber; it may consider and amend bills, but may not grant\nthem final passage. Generally, the debate procedures of the Committee of the\nWhole are more flexible than those of the House itself. One advantage of the\nCommittee of the Whole is its ability to include otherwise non-voting members\nof [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\").\n\nMost committee work is performed by twenty standing committees, each of which\nhas jurisdiction over a specific set of issues, such as Agriculture or Foreign\nAffairs. Each standing committee considers, amends, and reports bills that\nfall under its jurisdiction. Committees have extensive powers with regard to\nbills; they may block legislation from reaching the floor of the House.\nStanding committees also oversee the departments and agencies of the executive\nbranch. In discharging their duties, standing committees have the power to\nhold hearings and to [subpoena](/wiki/Subpoena \"Subpoena\") witnesses and\nevidence.\n\nThe House also has one permanent committee that is not a standing committee,\nthe [Permanent Select Committee on\nIntelligence](/wiki/United_States_House_Permanent_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence\n\"United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\"), and from\ntime to time may establish committees that are temporary and advisory in\nnature, such as the [Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global\nWarming](/wiki/Select_Committee_on_Energy_Independence_and_Global_Warming\n\"Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming\"). This latter\ncommittee, created in the 110th Congress and reauthorized for the 111th, has\nno jurisdiction over legislation and must be chartered anew at the start of\nevery Congress. The House also appoints members to serve on joint committees,\nwhich include members of the Senate and House. Some joint committees oversee\nindependent government bodies; for instance, the Joint Committee on the\nLibrary oversees the [Library of Congress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library\nof Congress\"). Other joint committees serve to make advisory reports; for\nexample, there exists a [Joint Committee on\nTaxation](/wiki/United_States_Congress_Joint_Committee_on_Taxation \"United\nStates Congress Joint Committee on Taxation\"). Bills and nominees are not\nreferred to joint committees. Hence, the power of joint committees is\nconsiderably lower than those of standing committees.\n\nEach House committee and subcommittee is led by a chairman (always a member of\nthe majority party). From 1910 to the 1970s, committee chairs were powerful.\n[Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson \"Woodrow Wilson\") in his classic\nstudy,[59] suggested:\n\n> Power is nowhere concentrated; it is rather deliberately and of set policy\n> scattered amongst many small chiefs. It is divided up, as it were, into\n> forty-seven seigniories, in each of which a Standing Committee is the court-\n> baron and its chairman lord-proprietor. These petty barons, some of them not\n> a little powerful, but none of them within the reach of the full powers of\n> rule, may at will exercise almost despotic sway within their own shires, and\n> may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm itself.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1975 committee and subcommittee chairmanship was determined\npurely by seniority; congressmembers sometimes had to wait 30 years to get\none, but their chairship was independent of party leadership. The rules were\nchanged in 1975 to permit party [caucuses](/wiki/Caucus \"Caucus\") to elect\nchairmen, shifting power upward to the party leaders. In 1995, Republicans\nunder [Newt Gingrich](/wiki/Newt_Gingrich \"Newt Gingrich\") set a limit of\nthree two-year terms for committee chairs. The chairman's powers are\nextensive; he controls the committee/subcommittee agenda, and may prevent the\ncommittee from dealing with a bill. The senior member of the minority party is\nknown as the Ranking Member. In some committees like Appropriations, partisan\ndisputes are few.\n\n## Legislative\nfunctions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Legislative functions\")]\n\nMost bills may be introduced in either House of Congress. However, the\nConstitution states, \"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the\nHouse of Representatives\". As a result of the [Origination\nClause](/wiki/Origination_Clause \"Origination Clause\"), the Senate cannot\ninitiate bills imposing taxes. This provision barring the Senate from\nintroducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the [British\nParliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Parliament of the United\nKingdom\"), in which only the [House of\nCommons](/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom \"House of Commons of the\nUnited Kingdom\") may originate such measures. Furthermore, congressional\ntradition holds that the House of Representatives originates [appropriation\nbills](/wiki/Appropriation_bill \"Appropriation bill\").\n\nAlthough it cannot originate revenue bills, the Senate retains the power to\namend or reject them. [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson \"Woodrow Wilson\")\nwrote the following about appropriations bills:[60]\n\n> [T]he constitutional prerogative of the House has been held to apply to all\n> the general appropriations bills, and the Senate's right to amend these has\n> been allowed the widest possible scope. The upper house may add to them what\n> it pleases; may go altogether outside of their original provisions and tack\n> to them entirely new features of legislation, altering not only the amounts\n> but even the objects of expenditure, and making out of the materials sent\n> them by the popular chamber measures of an almost totally new character.\n\nThe approval of the Senate and the House of Representatives is required for a\nbill to become law. Both Houses must pass the same version of the bill; if\nthere are differences, they may be resolved by a [conference\ncommittee](/wiki/Conference_committee \"Conference committee\"), which includes\nmembers of both bodies. For the stages through which bills pass in the Senate,\nsee [Act of Congress](/wiki/Act_of_Congress \"Act of Congress\").\n\nThe President may [veto](/wiki/Veto \"Veto\") a bill passed by the House and\nSenate. If he does, the bill does not become law unless each House, by a two-\nthirds vote, votes to override the veto.\n\n## Checks and\nbalances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Checks and balances\")]\n\nThe Constitution provides that the Senate's \"[advice and\nconsent](/wiki/Advice_and_consent \"Advice and consent\")\" is necessary for the\nPresident to make appointments and to ratify treaties. Thus, with its\npotential to frustrate Presidential appointments, the Senate is more powerful\nthan the House.\n\nThe Constitution empowers the House of Representatives to\n[impeach](/wiki/Impeachment \"Impeachment\") federal officials for\n\"[Treason](/wiki/Treason \"Treason\"), [Bribery](/wiki/Bribery \"Bribery\"), or\nother high [Crimes](/wiki/Crime \"Crime\") and [Misdemeanors](/wiki/Misdemeanor\n\"Misdemeanor\")\" and empowers the Senate to try such impeachments. The House\nmay approve \"articles of impeachment\" by a simple majority vote; however, a\ntwo-thirds vote is required for conviction in the Senate. A convicted official\nis automatically removed from office and may be disqualified from holding\nfuture office under the United States. No further punishment is permitted\nduring the impeachment proceedings; however, the party may face criminal\npenalties in a normal court of law.\n\nIn the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has\nimpeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. (Another, [Richard\nNixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\"), resigned after the [House\nJudiciary Committee](/wiki/House_Judiciary_Committee \"House Judiciary\nCommittee\") passed [articles of impeachment](/wiki/Articles_of_impeachment\n\"Articles of impeachment\") but before a formal impeachment vote by the full\nHouse.) Only two Presidents of the United States have ever been impeached:\n[Andrew Johnson](/wiki/Andrew_Johnson \"Andrew Johnson\") in 1868 and [Bill\nClinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\") in 1998. Both trials ended in\nacquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds\nmajority required for conviction.\n\nUnder the [Twelfth\nAmendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twelfth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\"), the House has the power to\nelect the President if no presidential candidate receives a majority of votes\nin the [Electoral College](/wiki/Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Electoral College \\(United States\\)\"). The Twelfth Amendment requires the\nHouse to choose from the three candidates with the highest numbers of\nelectoral votes. The Constitution provides that \"the votes shall be taken by\nstates, the representation from each state having one vote.\" It is rare for no\npresidential candidate to receive a majority of electoral votes. In the\nhistory of the United States, the House has only had to choose a President\ntwice. In 1800, which was before the adoption of the [Twelfth\nAmendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twelfth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\"), it elected [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") over [Aaron\nBurr](/wiki/Aaron_Burr \"Aaron Burr\"). In 1824, it elected [John Quincy\nAdams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John Quincy Adams\") over [Andrew\nJackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\") and [William H.\nCrawford](/wiki/William_H._Crawford \"William H. Crawford\"). (If no vice-\npresidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the Senate\nelects the Vice President from the two candidates with the highest numbers of\nelectoral votes.)\n\n## Latest election results and current party\nstandings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Latest election results and current party standings\")]\n\nSee also: [United States House of Representatives elections,\n2016](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2016 \"United\nStates House of Representatives elections, 2016\") and [115th United States\nCongress](/wiki/115th_United_States_Congress \"115th United States Congress\")\n\n### Current\nstanding[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Current standing\")]\n\nAffiliation  | Members  | Delegates/resident  \ncommissioner  \n(non-voting) | State  \nmajorities  \n---|---|---|---  \n| [Republican Party](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party \\(United States\\)\") | 235  | 2  | 32   \n| [Democratic Party](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party \\(United States\\)\") | 193  | 3  | 12   \n| [Independent](/wiki/Independent_politician \"Independent politician\") | 0  | 1  | 0   \n| _Vacant_ | 7  | 0  |   \nTotal  | 435  | 6  |   \n  \n[61]\n\n### End of previous\nCongress[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: End of previous Congress\")]\n\nAffiliation  | Members  | Delegates/resident  \ncommissioner  \n(non-voting) | State  \nmajorities  \n---|---|---|---  \n| [Republican Party](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party \\(United States\\)\") | 246  | 0  |   \n| [Democratic Party](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party \\(United States\\)\") | 187  | 5  |   \n| [Independent](/wiki/Independent_politician \"Independent politician\") | 0  | 1[62] | 0   \n| _Vacant_ | 2  | 0  |   \nTotal  | 435  | 6  |   \n  \n  * [U.S. representative bibliography (congressional memoirs)](/wiki/U.S._representative_bibliography_\\(congressional_memoirs\\) \"U.S. representative bibliography \\(congressional memoirs\\)\")\n  * [Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives](/wiki/Third-party_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives\")\n  * [Women in the United States House of Representatives](/wiki/Women_in_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Women in the United States House of Representatives\")\n  * [At-large](/wiki/At-large \"At-large\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=United_States_House_of_Representatives&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ See [Public Law 62-5](/wiki/Public_Law_62-5 \"Public Law 62-5\") of 1911, though Congress has the authority to change that number.
