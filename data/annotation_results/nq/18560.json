It is an\n[adaptation](/wiki/Film_adaptation \"Film adaptation\") of the 1964 novel\n_[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory](/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory\n\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\")_ by [Roald Dahl](/wiki/Roald_Dahl \"Roald\nDahl\"). Dahl was credited with writing the film's screenplay; however, [David\nSeltzer](/wiki/David_Seltzer \"David Seltzer\"), who went uncredited in the\nfilm, was brought in to re-work Dahl's screenplay against his wishes, making\nmajor changes to the ending and adding musical numbers. These changes and\nother decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film.[4][5]\n\nThe film tells the story of Charlie Bucket ([Peter Ostrum](/wiki/Peter_Ostrum\n\"Peter Ostrum\")) as he receives a Golden Ticket and visits Willy Wonka's\nchocolate factory with four other children from around the world. Filming took\nplace in [Munich](/wiki/Munich \"Munich\") in 1970, and the film was released by\n[Paramount Pictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\") on June\n30, 1971. With a budget of just $3 million, the film received generally\npositive reviews and earned $4 million by the end of its original run.\nParamount distributed the film until 1977, and beginning in the 1980s, [Warner\nBros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") assumed control of the rights for\nhome entertainment purposes. The film then made an additional $21 million\nduring its re-release by Warner Bros. under its [Family\nEntertainment](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Family_Entertainment \"Warner Bros. Family\nEntertainment\") banner in 1996. The film became highly popular in part through\nrepeated television airings and home entertainment sales.[6] In 1972, the film\nreceived an [Academy Award](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\") nomination\nfor [Best Original Score](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Original_Music_Score\n\"Academy Award for Original Music Score\"), and Wilder was nominated for a\n[Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical or\nComedy](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_%E2%80%93_Motion_Picture_Musical_or_Comedy\n\"Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\"), but\nlost both to _[Fiddler on the Roof](/wiki/Fiddler_on_the_Roof_\\(film\\)\n\"Fiddler on the Roof \\(film\\)\")_. The film also introduced the song \"[The\nCandy Man](/wiki/The_Candy_Man \"The Candy Man\")\", which went on to become a\npopular hit when recorded by [Sammy Davis Jr.](/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr. \"Sammy\nDavis Jr.\") In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United\nStates [National Film Registry](/wiki/National_Film_Registry \"National Film\nRegistry\") by the [Library of Congress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library of\nCongress\") as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Main cast\n    * 2.1 Oompa Loompas\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Development\n    * 3.2 Casting\n    * 3.3 Filming\n    * 3.4 Promotion\n  * 4 Reception\n    * 4.1 Dahl's reaction\n  * 5 Television\n  * 6 Adaptation\n  * 7 Home media\n  * 8 Music\n  * 9 Soundtrack\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 Notes\n  * 12 References\n  * 13 External links\n\n##\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nIn an unnamed town, children visit a candy shop. Charlie Bucket, a poor\npaperboy, stares through the window as the shop owner sings \"[The Candy\nMan](/wiki/The_Candy_Man \"The Candy Man\")\". Walking home, he passes [Willy\nWonka](/wiki/Willy_Wonka \"Willy Wonka\")'s chocolate factory. A mysterious\ntinker recites the first lines of [William Allingham](/wiki/William_Allingham\n\"William Allingham\")'s poem \"The Fairies\", and tells Charlie, \"Nobody ever\ngoes in, and nobody ever comes out.\" Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother\nand [bedridden](/wiki/Bedridden \"Bedridden\") grandparents. After telling\nGrandpa Joe about the tinker, Joe reveals that Wonka locked the factory\nbecause other candy makers, including rival Arthur Slugworth, sent in spies to\nsteal his recipes. Wonka disappeared, but for three years resumed selling\ncandy; the origin of Wonka's labor force is unknown.\n\nThe next day, Wonka announces that he hid five \"Golden Tickets\" in chocolate\n[Wonka Bars](/wiki/Wonka_Bar \"Wonka Bar\"). Finders of the tickets will receive\na factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Four of the tickets are\nfound by Augustus Gloop, a gluttonous boy; Veruca Salt, a spoiled girl; Violet\nBeauregarde, a gum-chewing girl; and Mike Teavee, a television-obsessed boy.\nAs each winner's announced on TV, a man whispers to them. Charlie opens two\nWonka Bars but finds no Golden Ticket and loses hope. The newspapers announce\nthe fifth ticket was found by a millionaire in [Paraguay](/wiki/Paraguay\n\"Paraguay\"). Charlie finds money in a gutter and uses it to buy a\nScrumdiddlyumptious bar. With the change, he buys a Wonka Bar for Joe. Walking\nhome, as Charlie hears newspapers[_[vague](/wiki/Wikipedia:Vagueness\n\"Wikipedia:Vagueness\")_] revealing that the Paraguayan millionaire's ticket is\na forgery, he opens the Wonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket. While\nrushing home, he is confronted by the same man seen whispering to the other\nwinners, who introduces himself as Slugworth and offers a reward for a sample\nof Wonka's latest creation, the [Everlasting\nGobstopper](/wiki/Everlasting_Gobstopper \"Everlasting Gobstopper\").\n\nCharlie returns home with the Golden Ticket and chooses Grandpa Joe as his\nchaperone and they sing \"I've Got A Golden Ticket\". The next day, Wonka greets\nthe ticket winners and leads them inside where each signs a contract before\nthe tour. The factory includes a river of chocolate, edible mushrooms,\nlickable wallpaper, and other sweets and inventions. As the visitors sample\nthese, Wonka sings \"Pure Imagination\". The visitors see Wonka's workers, small\nmen known as [Oompa-Loompas](/wiki/Oompa-Loompa \"Oompa-Loompa\"), who sing\ntheir song whenever a ticket holder falls into a trap. Augustus falls into the\nchocolate river and is sucked up a pipe to the Fudge Room. In the Inventing\nRoom, everyone receives an Everlasting Gobstopper. Violet becomes a large\nblueberry after chewing an experimental gum containing a three-course meal,\ndespite Wonka's warnings. The group reaches the Fizzy Lifting Drinks Room,\nwhere Charlie and Grandpa Joe ignore Wonka's warning and sample the drinks.\nThey float and have a near-fatal encounter with an exhaust fan before burping\nback to the ground. In the Chocolate Eggs Room, Veruca demands a golden goose\nfor herself before falling into a garbage chute leading to the furnace, with\nher father falling in trying to rescue her. The group tests out Wonka's\nWonkavision, only to have Mike teleport himself and become only a few inches\ntall.\n\nOnly Charlie and Grandpa Joe remain, but Wonka dismisses them without the\npromised chocolate. When Grandpa Joe asks him why, Wonka angrily explains that\nthey violated the contract by stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks and will receive\nnothing. An angered Grandpa Joe suggests to Charlie that he should give\nSlugworth the Gobstopper in revenge, but Charlie returns the candy back to\nWonka. With this selfless act, Wonka declares Charlie as the winner. He\nreveals that Slugworth is actually \"Mr. Wilkinson\", an employee of his, and\nthe offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test which only Charlie passed.\nThe trio enter the \"Wonkavator\", a multi-directional glass elevator that flies\nout of the factory. Soaring over the city, Wonka reveals that his actual prize\nis the factory; Wonka created the contest to find a worthy heir enough, and so\nCharlie and his family can immediately move in. Wonka then reminds Charlie not\nto forget about the man who suddenly received everything he ever wanted.\nCharlie asks, \"What ever happened to him?\" to which Wonka replies, \"He lived\nhappily ever after.\"\n\n  \n\n## Main\ncast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Main cast\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/Main_Cast_of_Willy_Wonka_and_the_Chocolate_Factory.jpg/220px-\nMain_Cast_of_Willy_Wonka_and_the_Chocolate_Factory.jpg)](/wiki/File:Main_Cast_of_Willy_Wonka_and_the_Chocolate_Factory.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Main_Cast_of_Willy_Wonka_and_the_Chocolate_Factory.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe main cast.  \nBack row (left to right): Michael Bollner, Ursula Reit, Gene Wilder  \nFront row (left to right): Leonard Stone, Denise Nickerson, Roy Kinnear, Julie\nDawn Cole, Dodo Denny, Paris Themmen, Peter Ostrum, Jack Albertson\n\nMain article: [List of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_characters \"List\nof Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters\")\n\n  * [Gene Wilder](/wiki/Gene_Wilder \"Gene Wilder\") as [Willy Wonka](/wiki/Willy_Wonka \"Willy Wonka\")\n  * [Jack Albertson](/wiki/Jack_Albertson \"Jack Albertson\") as [Grandpa Joe](/wiki/Grandpa_Joe \"Grandpa Joe\")\n  * [Peter Ostrum](/wiki/Peter_Ostrum \"Peter Ostrum\") as [Charlie Bucket](/wiki/Charlie_Bucket \"Charlie Bucket\")\n  * [Roy Kinnear](/wiki/Roy_Kinnear \"Roy Kinnear\") as Henry Salt\n  * [Julie Dawn Cole](/wiki/Julie_Dawn_Cole \"Julie Dawn Cole\") as [Veruca Salt](/wiki/Veruca_Salt_\\(character\\) \"Veruca Salt \\(character\\)\")\n  * [Leonard Stone](/wiki/Leonard_Stone \"Leonard Stone\") as Sam Beauregarde\n  * [Denise Nickerson](/wiki/Denise_Nickerson \"Denise Nickerson\") as [Violet Beauregarde](/wiki/Violet_Beauregarde \"Violet Beauregarde\")\n  * [Dodo Denney](/wiki/Nora_Denney \"Nora Denney\") as Mrs. Teevee\n  * [Paris Themmen](/wiki/Paris_Themmen \"Paris Themmen\") as [Mike Teevee](/wiki/Mike_Teavee \"Mike Teavee\")\n  * [Ursula Reit](/wiki/Ursula_Reit \"Ursula Reit\") as Mrs. Gloop\n  * Michael Bollner as [Augustus Gloop](/wiki/Augustus_Gloop \"Augustus Gloop\")\n  * [Diana Sowle](/wiki/Diana_Sowle \"Diana Sowle\") as Mrs. Bucket\n  * [Aubrey Woods](/wiki/Aubrey_Woods \"Aubrey Woods\") as Bill, the Candy Shop owner\n  * [David Battley](/wiki/David_Battley \"David Battley\") as [Mr. Turkentine](/wiki/List_of_Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_characters#Mr._Turkentine \"List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters\")\n  * [Günter Meisner](/wiki/G%C3%BCnter_Meisner \"Günter Meisner\") as Arthur Slugworth/Mr. Wilkinson\n  * [Peter Capell](/wiki/Peter_Capell \"Peter Capell\") as The Tinker\n  * [Werner Heyking](/wiki/Werner_Heyking \"Werner Heyking\") as Mr. Jopeck\n  * Peter Stuart as Winkelmann\n\n### Oompa\nLoompas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Oompa Loompas\")]\n\n  * [Rusty Goffe](/wiki/Rusty_Goffe \"Rusty Goffe\")\n  * Rudy Borgstaller\n  * [George Claydon](/wiki/George_Claydon \"George Claydon\")\n  * [Malcolm Dixon](/wiki/Malcolm_Dixon_\\(actor\\) \"Malcolm Dixon \\(actor\\)\")\n  * Ismed Hassan\n  * Norman McGlen\n  * [Angelo Muscat](/wiki/Angelo_Muscat \"Angelo Muscat\")\n  * Pepe Poupee\n  * Marcus Powell\n  * Albert Wilkinson\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n###\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nThe idea for [adapting the book into a film](/wiki/Film_adaptation \"Film\nadaptation\") came about when director [Mel Stuart's](/wiki/Mel_Stuart \"Mel\nStuart\") ten-year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a\nfilm out of it, with \"Uncle Dave\" (producer [David L.\nWolper](/wiki/David_L._Wolper \"David L. Wolper\")) producing it. Stuart showed\nthe book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the [Quaker\nOats Company](/wiki/Quaker_Oats_Company \"Quaker Oats Company\") regarding a\nvehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago\n\"Chicago\")-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (since renamed [the Willy\nWonka Candy Company](/wiki/The_Willy_Wonka_Candy_Company \"The Willy Wonka\nCandy Company\") and sold to [Nestlé](/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9 \"Nestlé\")). Wolper\npersuaded the company, which had no previous experience in the film industry,\nto buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of\npromoting a new Quaker Oats _Wonka Bar_.[7]\n\nIt was agreed that the film would be a children's musical, and that Dahl\nhimself would write the screenplay.[7] However, the title was changed to\n_Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory_.\n\nScreenwriter [David Seltzer](/wiki/David_Seltzer \"David Seltzer\") conceived a\ngimmick exclusively for the film that had Wonka quoting numerous literary\nsources, such as [Arthur O'Shaughnessy](/wiki/Arthur_O%27Shaughnessy \"Arthur\nO'Shaughnessy\")'s _[Ode](/wiki/Ode_\\(poem\\) \"Ode \\(poem\\)\")_ , [Oscar\nWilde](/wiki/Oscar_Wilde \"Oscar Wilde\")'s _[The Importance of Being\nEarnest](/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest \"The Importance of Being\nEarnest\")_ , [Samuel Taylor Coleridge](/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge \"Samuel\nTaylor Coleridge\")'s _[The Rime of the Ancient\nMariner](/wiki/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner \"The Rime of the Ancient\nMariner\")_ and [William Shakespeare](/wiki/William_Shakespeare \"William\nShakespeare\")'s _[The Merchant of Venice](/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice \"The\nMerchant of Venice\")_. Seltzer also worked Slugworth (only mentioned as a\nrival candy maker in the book) into the plot as an actual character (only to\nbe revealed to be Wilkinson, one of Wonka's agents, at the end of the\nfilm).[7]\n\n###\nCasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Casting\")]\n\nAll six members of [Monty Python](/wiki/Monty_Python \"Monty Python\"): [Graham\nChapman](/wiki/Graham_Chapman \"Graham Chapman\"), [John\nCleese](/wiki/John_Cleese \"John Cleese\"), [Eric Idle](/wiki/Eric_Idle \"Eric\nIdle\"), [Terry Gilliam](/wiki/Terry_Gilliam \"Terry Gilliam\"), [Terry\nJones](/wiki/Terry_Jones \"Terry Jones\") and [Michael\nPalin](/wiki/Michael_Palin \"Michael Palin\"), expressed interest in playing\nWonka, but at the time they were deemed not big enough names for an\ninternational audience. Three of the members, Cleese, Idle and Palin, were\nlater seriously considered for the same role in [Tim Burton's\nversion](/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_\\(film\\) \"Charlie and the\nChocolate Factory \\(film\\)\").[8][9]\n\nBefore Wilder was officially cast for the role, producers considered [Fred\nAstaire](/wiki/Fred_Astaire \"Fred Astaire\"), [Joel Grey](/wiki/Joel_Grey \"Joel\nGrey\"), [Ron Moody](/wiki/Ron_Moody \"Ron Moody\") and [Jon\nPertwee](/wiki/Jon_Pertwee \"Jon Pertwee\").[9][10] [Spike\nMilligan](/wiki/Spike_Milligan \"Spike Milligan\") was Roald Dahl's original\nchoice to play Willy Wonka.[9] [Peter Sellers](/wiki/Peter_Sellers \"Peter\nSellers\") even begged Dahl for the role.[11]\n\nWhen Wilder was cast for the role, he accepted it on one condition:\n\n> When I make my first entrance, I'd like to come out of the door carrying a\n> cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy\n> Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly\n> quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I'm\n> walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I\n> realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just\n> before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back\n> up, to great applause.\n>\n> — Gene Wilder[12]\n\nThe reason why Wilder wanted this in the film was that \"from that time on, no\none will know if I'm lying or telling the truth.\"[12]\n\n[Jean Stapleton](/wiki/Jean_Stapleton \"Jean Stapleton\") turned down the role\nof Mrs. Teevee.[13][14] [Jim Backus](/wiki/Jim_Backus \"Jim Backus\") was\nconsidered for the role of Sam Beauregarde.[15] [Sammy Davis,\nJr.](/wiki/Sammy_Davis,_Jr. \"Sammy Davis, Jr.\") wanted to play Bill, the candy\nstore owner, but Stuart did not like the idea because he felt that the\npresence of a big star in the candy store scene would break the reality.[8]\nNevertheless, Davis' recording of the film's opening musical number, \"The\nCandy Man,\" would top the _[Billboard magazine](/wiki/Billboard_magazine\n\"Billboard magazine\")_ record charts in 1972, despite the fact that Davis\ninitially hated the song. [Anthony Newley](/wiki/Anthony_Newley \"Anthony\nNewley\") also wanted to play Bill, but Stuart also objected to this for the\nsame reason.[15]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\n[Principal photography](/wiki/Principal_photography \"Principal photography\")\ncommenced on April 30, 1970, and ended on November 19, 1970. The primary\nshooting location was [Munich](/wiki/Munich \"Munich\"), [Bavaria](/wiki/Bavaria\n\"Bavaria\"), [West Germany](/wiki/West_Germany \"West Germany\"), because it was\nsignificantly cheaper than filming in the United States and the setting was\nconducive to Wonka's factory; Stuart also liked the ambiguity and\nunfamiliarity of the location. External shots of the factory were filmed at\nthe [gasworks](/wiki/Gasworks \"Gasworks\") of [Stadtwerke\nMünchen](/wiki/Stadtwerke_M%C3%BCnchen \"Stadtwerke München\") (Emmy-Noether-\nStraße 10); the entrance and side buildings still exist.
