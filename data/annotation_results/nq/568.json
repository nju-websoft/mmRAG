He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters\nand is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the [Victorian\nera](/wiki/Victorian_era \"Victorian era\").[1] His works enjoyed unprecedented\npopularity during his lifetime, and by the 20th century critics and scholars\nhad recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy\nlasting popularity.[2][3]\n\nBorn in [Portsmouth](/wiki/Portsmouth \"Portsmouth\"), Dickens left school to\nwork in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a [debtors'\nprison](/wiki/Debtors%27_prison \"Debtors' prison\"). Despite his lack of formal\neducation, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five\n[novellas](/wiki/Novellas \"Novellas\"), hundreds of short stories and non-\nfiction articles, lectured and performed [readings](/wiki/Oral_interpretation\n\"Oral interpretation\") extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and\ncampaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social\nreforms.\n\nDickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of _[The\nPickwick Papers](/wiki/The_Pickwick_Papers \"The Pickwick Papers\")_. Within a\nfew years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his\nhumour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels,\nmost published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the\n[serial](/wiki/Serial_\\(literature\\) \"Serial \\(literature\\)\") publication of\nnarrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel\npublication.[4][5] [Cliffhanger](/wiki/Cliffhanger \"Cliffhanger\") endings in\nhis serial publications kept readers in suspense.[6] The instalment format\nallowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his\nplot and character development based on such feedback.[5] For example, when\nhis wife's [chiropodist](/wiki/Chiropodist \"Chiropodist\") expressed distress\nat the way Miss Mowcher in _[David Copperfield](/wiki/David_Copperfield \"David\nCopperfield\")_ seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the\ncharacter with positive features.[7] His plots were carefully constructed, and\nhe often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.[8] Masses of\nthe illiterate poor chipped in [ha'pennies](/wiki/Halfpenny_\\(British_pre-\ndecimal_coin\\) \"Halfpenny \\(British pre-decimal coin\\)\") to have each new\nmonthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of\nreaders.[9]\n\nDickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age.[10] His 1843\nnovella, _[A Christmas Carol](/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol \"A Christmas Carol\")_ ,\nremains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre.\n_[Oliver Twist](/wiki/Oliver_Twist \"Oliver Twist\")_ and _[Great\nExpectations](/wiki/Great_Expectations \"Great Expectations\")_ are also\nfrequently adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early\nVictorian London. His 1859 novel, _[A Tale of Two\nCities](/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities \"A Tale of Two Cities\")_ , set in London\nand Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens has been\npraised by fellow writers—from [Leo Tolstoy](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy \"Leo Tolstoy\")\nto [George Orwell](/wiki/George_Orwell \"George Orwell\") and [G. K.\nChesterton](/wiki/G._K._Chesterton \"G. K. Chesterton\")—for his\n[realism](/wiki/Realism_\\(arts\\) \"Realism \\(arts\\)\"), comedy, prose style,\nunique characterisations, and [social criticism](/wiki/Child_labour#Historical\n\"Child labour\"). On the other hand, [Oscar Wilde](/wiki/Oscar_Wilde \"Oscar\nWilde\"), [Henry James](/wiki/Henry_James \"Henry James\"), and [Virginia\nWoolf](/wiki/Virginia_Woolf \"Virginia Woolf\") complained of a lack of\npsychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism.\nThe term _Dickensian_ is used to describe something that is reminiscent of\nDickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically\nrepulsive characters.[11]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Early years\n  * 2 Journalism and early novels\n  * 3 First visit to the United States\n  * 4 Philanthropy\n  * 5 Religious views\n  * 6 Middle years\n  * 7 Last years\n  * 8 Second visit to the United States\n  * 9 Farewell readings\n  * 10 Death\n  * 11 Literary style\n    * 11.1 Characters\n    * 11.2 Autobiographical elements\n    * 11.3 Episodic writing\n    * 11.4 Social commentary\n    * 11.5 Literary techniques\n  * 12 Reception\n  * 13 Influence and legacy\n  * 14 Notable works\n  * 15 References\n  * 16 Further reading\n  * 17 External links\n    * 17.1 Works\n    * 17.2 Organisations and portals\n    * 17.3 Museums\n    * 17.4 Other\n\n## Early years\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/CharlesDickens_house_Portsmouth.JPG/220px-\nCharlesDickens_house_Portsmouth.JPG)](/wiki/File:CharlesDickens_house_Portsmouth.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CharlesDickens_house_Portsmouth.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nCharles Dickens's birthplace, 393 Commercial Road, Portsmouth\n\n[![photograph](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/ChathamOrdnanceTerrCrop.jpg/220px-\nChathamOrdnanceTerrCrop.jpg)](/wiki/File:ChathamOrdnanceTerrCrop.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ChathamOrdnanceTerrCrop.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n2 Ordnance Terrace, [Chatham](/wiki/Chatham,_Medway \"Chatham, Medway\"),\nDickens's home 1817 – May 1821[12]\n\nCharles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812, at 1 Mile End Terrace\n(now 393 Commercial Road), [Landport](/wiki/Landport \"Landport\") in [Portsea\nIsland](/wiki/Portsea_Island \"Portsea Island\") ([Portsmouth](/wiki/Portsmouth\n\"Portsmouth\")), the second of eight children of [Elizabeth\nDickens](/wiki/Elizabeth_Dickens \"Elizabeth Dickens\") (née Barrow; 1789–1863)\nand [John Dickens](/wiki/John_Dickens \"John Dickens\") (1785–1851). His father\nwas a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the\ndistrict. He asked Christopher Huffam,[13] rigger to His Majesty's Navy,\ngentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles.\nHuffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a\nshipping company in Dickens's novel _[Dombey and Son](/wiki/Dombey_and_Son\n\"Dombey and Son\")_ (1848).[13]\n\nIn January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved\nto Norfolk Street, [Fitzrovia](/wiki/Fitzrovia \"Fitzrovia\").[14] When Charles\nwas four, they relocated to [Sheerness](/wiki/Sheerness \"Sheerness\"), and\nthence to [Chatham](/wiki/Chatham,_Medway \"Chatham, Medway\"), Kent, where he\nspent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have\nbeen idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-\nparticularly-taken-care-of boy\".[15]\n\nCharles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the\n[picaresque novels](/wiki/Picaresque_novel \"Picaresque novel\") of [Tobias\nSmollett](/wiki/Tobias_Smollett \"Tobias Smollett\") and [Henry\nFielding](/wiki/Henry_Fielding \"Henry Fielding\"), as well as _[Robinson\nCrusoe](/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe \"Robinson Crusoe\")_ and _[Gil\nBlas](/wiki/Gil_Blas \"Gil Blas\")_. He read and reread _[The Arabian\nNights](/wiki/The_Arabian_Nights \"The Arabian Nights\")_ and the Collected\nFarces of [Elizabeth Inchbald](/wiki/Elizabeth_Inchbald \"Elizabeth\nInchbald\").[16] He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an\nexcellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.[17] His\nfather's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years\nof private education, first at a [dame school](/wiki/Dame_school \"Dame\nschool\"), and then at a school run by William Giles, a\n[dissenter](/wiki/English_Dissenters \"English Dissenters\"), in Chatham.[18]\n\n[![drawing](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Dickens-at-\nthe-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg/170px-Dickens-at-the-Blacking-\nWarehouse.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIllustration by Fred Bernard of Dickens at work in a shoe-blacking factory\nafter his father had been sent to the [Marshalsea](/wiki/Marshalsea\n\"Marshalsea\"), published in the 1892 edition of Forster's _Life of\nDickens_[19]\n\nThis period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to\nNavy Pay Office headquarters at [Somerset House](/wiki/Somerset_House\n\"Somerset House\"), and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to\nfinish his final term of work) moved to [Camden Town](/wiki/Camden_Town\n\"Camden Town\") in London.[20] The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting\ndebts, and, living beyond his means,[21] John Dickens was forced by his\ncreditors into the [Marshalsea](/wiki/Marshalsea \"Marshalsea\") [debtors'\nprison](/wiki/Debtors%27_prison \"Debtors' prison\") in\n[Southwark](/wiki/Southwark \"Southwark\"), London in 1824. His wife and\nyoungest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles,\nthen 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112\nCollege Place, Camden Town.[22] Roylance was \"a reduced [impoverished] old\nlady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few\nalterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs. Pipchin\" in _Dombey and Son_. Later,\nhe lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the [Insolvent\nCourt](/wiki/Insolvency \"Insolvency\"), Archibald Russell, \"a fat, good-\nnatured, kind old gentleman... with a quiet old wife\" and lame son, in [Lant\nStreet](/wiki/Lant_Street \"Lant Street\") in Southwark.[23] They provided the\ninspiration for the Garlands in _[The Old Curiosity\nShop](/wiki/The_Old_Curiosity_Shop \"The Old Curiosity Shop\")_.[24]\n\nOn Sundays—with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the [Royal\nAcademy of Music](/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Music \"Royal Academy of Music\")—he\nspent the day at the Marshalsea.[25] Dickens later used the prison as a\nsetting in _[Little Dorrit](/wiki/Little_Dorrit \"Little Dorrit\")_. To pay for\nhis board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work\nten-hour days at Warren's [Blacking](/wiki/Shoe_polish \"Shoe polish\")\nWarehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present [Charing Cross railway\nstation](/wiki/Charing_Cross_railway_station \"Charing Cross railway station\"),\nwhere he earned six [shillings](/wiki/Shilling \"Shilling\") a week pasting\nlabels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working\nconditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his\nfiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of\nsocio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were\nunfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have\nbeen so easily cast away at such an age\".[26] As he recalled to [John\nForster](/wiki/John_Forster_\\(biographer\\) \"John Forster \\(biographer\\)\")\n(from _The Life of Charles Dickens_):\n\n> The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way,\n> at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of\n> course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms,\n> and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in\n> the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the\n> stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly\n> before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first\n> floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it,\n> in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-\n> blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue\n> paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and\n> neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an\n> apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained\n> this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then\n> go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar\n> duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron\n> and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using\n> the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the\n> liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.[26]\n\nWhen the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of\n[Covent Garden](/wiki/Covent_Garden \"Covent Garden\") the boys worked in a room\nin which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and\nwatched them at work—in Dickens biographer [Simon Callow](/wiki/Simon_Callow\n\"Simon Callow\")'s estimation, the public display was \"a new refinement added\nto his misery\".[27]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Courtyard_of_the_former_Marshalsea_prison%2C_1897_%282%29.png/170px-\nCourtyard_of_the_former_Marshalsea_prison%2C_1897_%282%29.png)](/wiki/File:Courtyard_of_the_former_Marshalsea_prison,_1897_\\(2\\).png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Courtyard_of_the_former_Marshalsea_prison,_1897_\\(2\\).png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Marshalsea](/wiki/Marshalsea \"Marshalsea\") around 1897, after it had\nclosed\n\nA few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's paternal grandmother,\nElizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him £450. On the expectation of this\nlegacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the [Insolvent Debtors\nAct](/wiki/Act_of_Parliament \"Act of Parliament\"), Dickens arranged for\npayment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea,[28] for the\nhome of Mrs Roylance.\n\nCharles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal\nfrom the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father\nshould rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home:\n\"I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my\nmother was warm for my being sent back\". His mother's failure to request his\nreturn was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.[29]\n\nRighteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under\nwhich [working-class](/wiki/Working_class \"Working class\") people lived became\nmajor themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to\nwhich he alluded in his favourite, and most [autobiographical,\nnovel](/wiki/Autobiographical_novel \"Autobiographical novel\"), _[David\nCopperfield](/wiki/David_Copperfield \"David Copperfield\")_ :[30] \"I had no\nadvice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no\nsupport, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to\nheaven!\"[31]\n\nDickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in [Camden\nTown](/wiki/Camden_Town \"Camden Town\"), where he remained until March 1827,\nhaving spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good\nschool: \"Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated\nby the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down\natmosphere, are embodied in Mr. Creakle's Establishment in _David\nCopperfield_.\"[31]\n\nDickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn\nCourt, [Gray's Inn](/wiki/Gray%27s_Inn \"Gray's Inn\"), as a junior\n[clerk](/wiki/Law_clerk \"Law clerk\") from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a\ngifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers, and clerks.\nHe went to theatres obsessively—he claimed that for at least three years he\nwent to the theatre every single day. His favourite actor was [Charles\nMathews](/wiki/Charles_Mathews \"Charles Mathews\"), and Dickens learnt his\n_monopolylogues_ , (farces in which Mathews played every character), by\nheart.[32] Then, having learned\n[Gurney's](/wiki/Thomas_Gurney_\\(shorthand_writer\\) \"Thomas Gurney \\(shorthand\nwriter\\)\") system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a\nfreelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance\nreporter at [Doctors' Commons](/wiki/Doctors%27_Commons \"Doctors' Commons\"),\nand Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings\nfor nearly four years.[33][34] This education was to inform works such as\n_[Nicholas Nickleby](/wiki/Nicholas_Nickleby \"Nicholas Nickleby\")_ , _Dombey\nand Son_ , and especially _Bleak House_ —whose vivid portrayal of the\nmachinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the\ngeneral public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own\nviews regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by\ncircumstances to \"go to law\".\n\nIn 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the\nmodel for the character Dora in _David Copperfield_. Maria's parents\ndisapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to\nschool in Paris.[35]\n\n## Journalism and early novels\n\nIn 1832, at age 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.[36]\nHe enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense\nof what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the\ntheatre—he became an early member of the [Garrick](/wiki/Garrick_Club \"Garrick\nClub\")[37]—he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager\n[George Bartley](/wiki/George_Bartley_\\(comedian\\) \"George Bartley\n\\(comedian\\)\") and the actor [Charles Kemble](/wiki/Charles_Kemble \"Charles\nKemble\") were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate\nthe comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of\na cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a\nwriter.[38] In 1833 he submitted his first story, \"A Dinner at Poplar Walk\",\nto the London periodical _[Monthly Magazine](/wiki/Monthly_Magazine \"Monthly\nMagazine\")_.[39] William Barrow, a brother of his mother, offered him a job on\n_The Mirror of Parliament_ and he worked in the [House of\nCommons](/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom \"House of Commons of the\nUnited Kingdom\") for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at\n[Furnival's Inn](/wiki/Furnival%27s_Inn \"Furnival's Inn\") and worked as a\npolitical journalist, reporting on\n[Parliamentary](/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Parliament of the\nUnited Kingdom\") debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election\ncampaigns for the _[Morning Chronicle](/wiki/Morning_Chronicle \"Morning\nChronicle\")_. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed\nhis first collection of pieces, published in 1836: _[Sketches by\nBoz](/wiki/Sketches_by_Boz \"Sketches by Boz\")_ —Boz being a family nickname he\nemployed as a pseudonym for some years.[40][41] Dickens apparently adopted it\nfrom the nickname \"Moses\", which he had given to his youngest brother\n[Augustus Dickens](/wiki/Augustus_Dickens \"Augustus Dickens\"), after a\ncharacter in Oliver Goldsmith's _[The Vicar of\nWakefield](/wiki/The_Vicar_of_Wakefield \"The Vicar of Wakefield\")_. When\npronounced by anyone with a head cold, \"Moses\" became \"Boses\"—later shortened\nto _Boz_.[41][42] Dickens's own name was considered \"queer\" by a contemporary\ncritic, who wrote in 1849: \"Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer\nname, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations.\" He\ncontributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career.[39] In\nJanuary 1835 the _Morning Chronicle_ launched an evening edition, under the\neditorship of the _Chronicle '_s music critic, [George\nHogarth](/wiki/George_Hogarth \"George Hogarth\"). Hogarth invited Dickens to\ncontribute _Street Sketches_ and Dickens became a regular visitor to his\nFulham house, excited by Hogarth's friendship with a hero of his, [Walter\nScott](/wiki/Walter_Scott \"Walter Scott\"), and enjoying the company of\nHogarth's three daughters—Georgina, Mary, and nineteen-year-old Catherine.[43]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Catherine_Dickens.jpg/170px-\nCatherine_Dickens.jpg)](/wiki/File:Catherine_Dickens.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Catherine_Dickens.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCatherine Hogarth Dickens by [Samuel Lawrence](/wiki/Samuel_Lawrence \"Samuel\nLawrence\") (1838)\n\nDickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a\nfriendship with [William Harrison Ainsworth](/wiki/William_Harrison_Ainsworth\n\"William Harrison Ainsworth\"), the author of the highwayman novel\n_[Rookwood](/wiki/Rookwood_\\(novel\\) \"Rookwood \\(novel\\)\")_ (1834), whose\nbachelor salon in [Harrow Road](/wiki/Harrow_Road \"Harrow Road\") had become\nthe meeting place for a set that included [Daniel\nMaclise](/wiki/Daniel_Maclise \"Daniel Maclise\"), [Benjamin\nDisraeli](/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli \"Benjamin Disraeli\"), [Edward Bulwer-\nLytton](/wiki/Edward_Bulwer-Lytton \"Edward Bulwer-Lytton\"), and [George\nCruikshank](/wiki/George_Cruikshank \"George Cruikshank\"). All these became his\nfriends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his\nfirst publisher, John Macrone, at the house.[44] The success of _Sketches by\nBoz_ led to a proposal from publishers [Chapman and\nHall](/wiki/Chapman_and_Hall \"Chapman and Hall\") for Dickens to supply text to\nmatch [Robert Seymour](/wiki/Robert_Seymour_\\(illustrator\\) \"Robert Seymour\n\\(illustrator\\)\")'s engraved illustrations in a monthly\n[letterpress](/wiki/Letterpress_printing \"Letterpress printing\"). Seymour\ncommitted suicide after the second instalment, and Dickens, who wanted to\nwrite a connected series of sketches, hired \"[Phiz](/wiki/Hablot_Knight_Browne\n\"Hablot Knight Browne\")\" to provide the engravings (which were reduced from\nfour to two per instalment) for the story. The resulting story became _[The\nPickwick Papers](/wiki/The_Pickwick_Papers \"The Pickwick Papers\")_ , and\nthough the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the\nCockney character [Sam Weller](/wiki/Sam_Weller_\\(character\\) \"Sam Weller\n\\(character\\)\") in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz)\nmarked a sharp climb in its popularity.[45] The final instalment sold 40,000\ncopies.[39]\n\nIn November 1836 Dickens accepted the position of editor of _[Bentley's\nMiscellany](/wiki/Bentley%27s_Miscellany \"Bentley's Miscellany\")_, a position\nhe held for three years, until he fell out with the owner.[46] In 1836 as he\nfinished the last instalments of _The Pickwick Papers_ , he began writing the\nbeginning instalments of _[Oliver Twist](/wiki/Oliver_Twist \"Oliver Twist\")_\n—writing as many as 90 pages a month—while continuing work on _Bentley 's_ and\nalso writing four plays, the production of which he oversaw. _Oliver Twist,_\npublished in 1838, became one of Dickens's better known stories, and was the\nfirst Victorian novel with a child [protagonist](/wiki/Protagonist\n\"Protagonist\").[47]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Charles_Dickens_by_Daniel_Maclise.jpg/170px-\nCharles_Dickens_by_Daniel_Maclise.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charles_Dickens_by_Daniel_Maclise.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charles_Dickens_by_Daniel_Maclise.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nYoung Charles Dickens by [Daniel Maclise](/wiki/Daniel_Maclise \"Daniel\nMaclise\"), 1839\n\nOn 2 April 1836, after a one-year engagement, and between episodes two and\nthree of _The Pickwick Papers_ , Dickens married [Catherine Thomson\nHogarth](/wiki/Catherine_Dickens \"Catherine Dickens\") (1816–1879), the\ndaughter of George Hogarth, editor of the _[Evening\nChronicle](/wiki/Evening_Chronicle \"Evening Chronicle\")_.[48] They were\nmarried in St. Luke's Church,[49] [Chelsea](/wiki/Chelsea,_London \"Chelsea,\nLondon\"), London. After a brief honeymoon in [Chalk](/wiki/Chalk,_Kent \"Chalk,\nKent\") in Kent the couple returned to lodgings at [Furnival's\nInn](/wiki/Furnival%27s_Inn \"Furnival's Inn\").[50] The first of their [ten\nchildren](/wiki/Dickens_family \"Dickens family\"), Charley, was born in January\n1837, and a few months later the family set up [home in\nBloomsbury](/wiki/Charles_Dickens_Museum,_London \"Charles Dickens Museum,\nLondon\") at 48 Doughty Street, London, (on which Charles had a three-year\nlease at £80 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839.[48][51] Dickens's\nyounger brother [Frederick](/wiki/Frederick_Dickens \"Frederick Dickens\") and\nCatherine's 17-year-old sister Mary, moved in with them. Dickens became very\nattached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837.\nUnusually for Dickens, as a consequence of his shock, he stopped working, and\nhe and Kate stayed at a little farm on [Hampstead Heath](/wiki/Hampstead_Heath\n\"Hampstead Heath\") for a fortnight. Dickens idealised Mary- the character he\nfashioned after her, [Rose Maylie](/wiki/Rose_Maylie \"Rose Maylie\"), he found\nhe could not now kill, as he had planned, in his fiction[52] and according to\nAckroyd he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of [Little\nNell](/wiki/Little_Nell_\\(Dickens\\) \"Little Nell \\(Dickens\\)\") and Florence\nDombey.[53] His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for\nthe June instalment of _Pickwick Papers_ and had to cancel the _Oliver Twist_\ninstalment that month as well.[47] The time in Hampstead was the occasion for\na growing bond between Dickens and John Forster to develop and Forster soon\nbecame his unofficial business manager, and the first to read his work.[54]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Dolly_Varden_by_William_Powell_Frith.jpg/170px-\nDolly_Varden_by_William_Powell_Frith.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dolly_Varden_by_William_Powell_Frith.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dolly_Varden_by_William_Powell_Frith.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Barnaby Rudge_ was Dickens's first popular failure—but the character of Dolly\nVarden, \"pretty, witty, sexy, became central to numerous theatrical\nadaptations\"[55]\n\nHis success as a novelist continued. The young [Queen\nVictoria](/wiki/Queen_Victoria \"Queen Victoria\") read both _Oliver Twist_ and\n_Pickwick_ , staying up until midnight to discuss them.[56] _[Nicholas\nNickleby](/wiki/Nicholas_Nickleby \"Nicholas Nickleby\")_ (1838–39), _[The Old\nCuriosity Shop](/wiki/The_Old_Curiosity_Shop \"The Old Curiosity Shop\")_\n(1840–41) and, finally, his first historical novel, _[Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of\nthe Riots of'Eighty](/wiki/Barnaby_Rudge \"Barnaby Rudge\")_, as part of the\n_[Master Humphrey's Clock](/wiki/Master_Humphrey%27s_Clock \"Master Humphrey's\nClock\")_ series (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before\nbeing made into books.[57]\n\nIn the midst of all his activity during this period there was discontent with\nhis publishers and John Macrone was bought off, while [Richard\nBentley](/wiki/Richard_Bentley_\\(publisher\\) \"Richard Bentley \\(publisher\\)\")\nsigned over all his rights in _Oliver Twist_. Other signs of a certain\nrestlessness and discontent emerge—in [Broadstairs](/wiki/Broadstairs\n\"Broadstairs\") he flirted with Eleanor Picken, the young fiancée of his\nsolicitor's best friend, and one night grabbed her and ran with her down to\nthe sea. He declared they were both to drown there in the \"sad sea waves\". She\nfinally got free but afterwards kept her distance. In June 1841 he\nprecipitately set out on a two-month tour of Scotland and then, in September\n1841, telegraphed Forster that he had decided to go to America.[58] _Master\nHumphrey 's Clock_ was shut down, though Dickens was still keen on the idea of\nthe weekly magazine, a form he liked, a liking that had begun with his\nchildhood reading of the eighteenth-century magazines\n_[Tatler](/wiki/Tatler_\\(1709_journal\\) \"Tatler \\(1709 journal\\)\")_ and _[The\nSpectator](/wiki/The_Spectator \"The Spectator\")_.\n\n## First visit to the United States\n\nIn 1842, Dickens and his wife made their first trip to the United States and\nCanada. At this time [Georgina Hogarth](/wiki/Georgina_Hogarth \"Georgina\nHogarth\"), another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now\nliving at Devonshire Terrace, [Marylebone](/wiki/Marylebone \"Marylebone\"), to\ncare for the young family they had left behind.[59] She remained with them as\nhousekeeper, organiser, adviser, and friend until Dickens's death in 1870.[60]\nDickens modeled the character of [Agnes Wickfield](/wiki/Agnes_Wickfield\n\"Agnes Wickfield\") after Georgina and Mary.[61]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Charles_Dickens_sketch_1842.jpg/170px-\nCharles_Dickens_sketch_1842.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charles_Dickens_sketch_1842.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charles_Dickens_sketch_1842.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSketch of Dickens in 1842 during his first American tour. Sketch of Dickens's\nsister Fanny, bottom left\n\nHe described his impressions in a [travelogue](/wiki/Travel_literature \"Travel\nliterature\"), _[American Notes for General Circulation](/wiki/American_Notes\n\"American Notes\")_. Dickens includes in _Notes_ a powerful condemnation of\nslavery, which he had attacked as early as _The Pickwick Papers_ , correlating\nthe emancipation of the poor in England with the abolition of slavery\nabroad[62] citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their\nmasters. In spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to\nAmerica, some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in\nDickens's views on racial inequality, for instance, he has been criticized for\nhis subsequent acquiescence in Governor [Eyre's](/wiki/Edward_John_Eyre\n\"Edward John Eyre\") harsh crackdown during the 1860s [Morant Bay\nrebellion](/wiki/Morant_Bay_rebellion \"Morant Bay rebellion\") in Jamaica and\nhis failure to join other British progressives in condemning it.[63] From\n[Richmond, Virginia](/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia \"Richmond, Virginia\"), Dickens\nreturned to Washington, D.C., and started a trek westward to St. Louis,\nMissouri. While there, he expressed a desire to see an American prairie before\nreturning east. A group of 13 men then set out with Dickens to visit Looking\nGlass Prairie, a trip 30 miles into [Illinois](/wiki/Illinois \"Illinois\").\n\nDuring his American visit, Dickens spent a month in New York City, giving\nlectures, raising [the question of international copyright\nlaws](/wiki/History_of_copyright_law \"History of copyright law\") and the\npirating of his work in America.[64][65] He persuaded a group of twenty-five\nwriters, headed by [Washington Irving](/wiki/Washington_Irving \"Washington\nIrving\"), to sign a petition for him to take to Congress, but the press were\ngenerally hostile to this, saying that he should be grateful for his\npopularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being\npirated.[66]\n\nThe popularity he gained caused a shift in his self-perception according to\ncritic Kate Flint, who writes that he \"found himself a cultural commodity, and\nits circulation had passed out his control\", causing him to become interested\nin and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next\nnovels.[67] She writes that he assumed a role of \"influential commentator\",\npublicly and in his fiction, evident in his next few books.[67] His trip to\nthe U.S. ended with a trip to Canada: Niagara Falls, Toronto, Kingston and\nMontreal where he appeared on stage in light comedies.[68]\n\nSoon after his return to England, Dickens began work on the first of his\nChristmas stories, _[A Christmas Carol](/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol \"A Christmas\nCarol\")_ , written in 1843, which was followed by _[The\nChimes](/wiki/The_Chimes \"The Chimes\")_ in 1844 and _[The Cricket on the\nHearth](/wiki/The_Cricket_on_the_Hearth \"The Cricket on the Hearth\")_ in 1845.\nOf these, _A Christmas Carol_ was most popular and, tapping into an old\ntradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas\nin Britain and America.[69] The seeds for the story became planted in\nDickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the\nmanufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed\nat the Field Lane [Ragged School](/wiki/Ragged_School \"Ragged School\"), caused\nDickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor. As the idea\nfor the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became\nengrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and\nlaughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London\nfifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to\nbed.\"[70]\n\nAfter living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846),\nwhere he began work on _[Dombey and Son](/wiki/Dombey_and_Son \"Dombey and\nSon\")_ (1846–48). This and _[David Copperfield](/wiki/David_Copperfield \"David\nCopperfield\")_ (1849–50) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career\nas his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his\nearly works.\n\nAt about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm\nwhere his brother, [Augustus](/wiki/Augustus_Dickens \"Augustus Dickens\"),\nworked (John Chapman & Co.). It had been carried out by [Thomas\nPowell](/wiki/Thomas_Powell_\\(1809-1887\\) \"Thomas Powell \\(1809-1887\\)\"), a\nclerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to\nAugustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew\nmany of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities,\nPowell fled to New York and published a book called _The Living Authors of\nEngland_ with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell\nhad written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that\nhe had based the character of Paul Dombey (_[Dombey and\nSon](/wiki/Dombey_and_Son \"Dombey and Son\")_) on Thomas Chapman, one of the\nprincipal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to\n[Lewis Gaylord Clark](/wiki/Lewis_Gaylord_Clark \"Lewis Gaylord Clark\"), editor\nof the New York literary magazine _[The Knickerbocker](/wiki/The_Knickerbocker\n\"The Knickerbocker\")_ , saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark\npublished the letter in the _[New-York Tribune](/wiki/New-York_Tribune \"New-\nYork Tribune\")_ , and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell\nbegan proceedings to sue these publications, and Clark was arrested. Dickens,\nrealising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co. to seek\nwritten confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming\nPowell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might\nhave to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing\nto the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his\naccusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of\ncourt.[71]\n\n## Philanthropy\n\n[Angela Burdett Coutts](/wiki/Angela_Burdett-Coutts,_1st_Baroness_Burdett-\nCoutts \"Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts\"), heir to the\nCoutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home\nfor the redemption of [fallen women](/wiki/Fallen_woman \"Fallen woman\") of the\nworking class. Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive\nregimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to\neducation and proficiency in domestic household chores. After initially\nresisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named \"Urania Cottage\", in the\nLime Grove section of [Shepherds Bush](/wiki/Shepherds_Bush \"Shepherds Bush\"),\nwhich he managed for ten years,[72] setting the house rules, reviewing the\naccounts and interviewing prospective residents.[73] Emigration and marriage\nwere central to Dickens's agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage, from\nwhich it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and\n1859.[74]\n\n## Religious views\n\nAs a young man Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organized\nreligion. In 1836, in a pamphlet titled _Sunday Under Three Heads_ , he\ndefended the people's right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on\nSundays. \"Look into your churches- diminished congregations and scanty\nattendance. People have grown sullen and obstinate, and are becoming disgusted\nwith the faith which condemns them to such a day as this, once in every seven.\nThey display their feeling by staying away [from church]. Turn into the\nstreets [on a Sunday] and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything\naround\"[75]\n\nDickens honoured the figure of Christ—though some claim he may have denied his\ndivinity.[76] Notwithstanding, Dickens has been characterized as a professing\nChristian.[77] His son, [Henry Fielding Dickens](/wiki/Henry_Fielding_Dickens\n\"Henry Fielding Dickens\"), described Dickens as someone who \"possessed deep\nreligious convictions\". In the early 1840s Dickens had shown an interest in\n[Unitarian Christianity](/wiki/Unitarianism \"Unitarianism\"), and [Robert\nBrowning](/wiki/Robert_Browning \"Robert Browning\") remarked that “Mr. Dickens\nis an enlightened Unitarian.”[78] Writer Gary Colledge, however, asserted that\nhe \"never strayed from his attachment to popular lay\n[Anglicanism](/wiki/Anglicanism \"Anglicanism\")\".[79] He also wrote a religious\nwork called _[The Life of Our Lord](/wiki/The_Life_of_Our_Lord \"The Life of\nOur Lord\")_ (1849), which was a short book about the life of [Jesus\nChrist](/wiki/Jesus_Christ \"Jesus Christ\"), written with the purpose of\ninculcating his faith to his children and family.[80][81]\n\nDickens disapproved of [Roman Catholicism](/wiki/Roman_Catholicism \"Roman\nCatholicism\") and 19th-century [evangelicalism](/wiki/Evangelicalism\n\"Evangelicalism\"), and was critical of what he saw as the hypocrisy of\nreligious institutions and philosophies like [spiritualism](/wiki/Spiritualism\n\"Spiritualism\"), all of which he considered deviations from the true spirit of\nChristianity.[82] [Leo Tolstoy](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy \"Leo Tolstoy\") and [Fyodor\nDostoyevsky](/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky \"Fyodor Dostoyevsky\") referred to\nDickens as \"that great Christian writer\".[83][84]\n\n## Middle years\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Little_Dorrit_avatar_1856.jpg/170px-\nLittle_Dorrit_avatar_1856.jpg)](/wiki/File:Little_Dorrit_avatar_1856.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Little_Dorrit_avatar_1856.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Little Dorrit\" 1856\n\nThe Francophile Dickens often vacationed in France, and in a speech delivered\nin Paris in 1846 in French called the French \"the first people in the\nuniverse\".[85] During his visit to Paris, Dickens met the French literati\nAlexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Eugène Scribe, Théophile Gautier, François-René\nde Chateaubriand and Eugène Sue.[85] Dickens started to write _[David\nCopperfield](/wiki/David_Copperfield \"David Copperfield\")_ in 1848. It was\npublished between 1849 and 1850. Scholars consider it as Dickens's veiled\nautobiography with the title character modeled after the author himself. It\nwas Dickens's personal favourite among his own novels.\n\nIn late November 1851, Dickens moved into [Tavistock\nHouse](/wiki/Tavistock_House \"Tavistock House\") where he wrote _[Bleak\nHouse](/wiki/Bleak_House \"Bleak House\")_ (1852–53), _[Hard\nTimes](/wiki/Hard_Times_\\(novel\\) \"Hard Times \\(novel\\)\")_ (1854), and\n_[Little Dorrit](/wiki/Little_Dorrit \"Little Dorrit\")_ (1856).[86] It was here\nthat he indulged in the amateur theatricals described in Forster's _Life_.[87]\nDuring this period he worked closely with the novelist and playwright [Wilkie\nCollins](/wiki/Wilkie_Collins \"Wilkie Collins\"). In 1856, his income from\nwriting allowed him to buy [Gad's Hill Place](/wiki/Gad%27s_Hill_Place \"Gad's\nHill Place\") in [Higham, Kent](/wiki/Higham,_Kent \"Higham, Kent\"). As a child,\nDickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it. The area was\nalso the scene of some of the events of\n[Shakespeare's](/wiki/William_Shakespeare \"William Shakespeare\") _[Henry IV,\nPart 1](/wiki/Henry_IV,_Part_1 \"Henry IV, Part 1\")_ , and this literary\nconnection pleased him.[88]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Ellen_Ternan.jpeg/170px-\nEllen_Ternan.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Ellen_Ternan.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ellen_Ternan.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Ellen Ternan](/wiki/Ellen_Ternan \"Ellen Ternan\"), 1858\n\nIn 1857, Dickens hired professional actresses for the play _[The Frozen\nDeep](/wiki/The_Frozen_Deep \"The Frozen Deep\")_ , written by him and his\n[protégé](/wiki/Mentorship \"Mentorship\"), [Wilkie\nCollins](/wiki/Wilkie_Collins \"Wilkie Collins\"). Dickens fell in love with one\nof the actresses, [Ellen Ternan](/wiki/Ellen_Ternan \"Ellen Ternan\"), and this\npassion was to last the rest of his life.[89] Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18\nwhen he made the decision, which went strongly against Victorian convention,\nto separate from his wife, Catherine, in 1858—divorce was still unthinkable\nfor someone as famous as he was. When Catherine left, never to see her husband\nagain, she took with her one child, leaving the other children to be raised by\nher sister Georgina who chose to stay at Gad's Hill.[60]\n\nDuring this period, whilst pondering a project to give public readings for his\nown profit, Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by [Great\nOrmond Street Hospital](/wiki/Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital \"Great Ormond\nStreet Hospital\"), to help it survive its first major financial crisis. His\n'Drooping Buds' essay in _[Household Words](/wiki/Household_Words \"Household\nWords\")_ earlier on 3 April 1852 was considered by the hospital's founders to\nhave been the catalyst for the hospital's success.[90] Dickens, whose\nphilanthropy was well-known, was asked by his friend, the hospital's founder\n[Charles West](/wiki/Charles_West_\\(physician\\) \"Charles West \\(physician\\)\"),\nto preside over the appeal, and he threw himself into the task, heart and\nsoul.[91] Dickens's public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment\nto put the hospital on a sound financial footing—one reading on 9 February\n1858 alone raised £3,000.[92][93][94]\n\nAfter separating from Catherine,[95] Dickens undertook a series of hugely\npopular and remunerative reading tours which, together with his journalism,\nwere to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade, in which he\nwas to write only two more novels.[96] His first reading tour, lasting from\nApril 1858 to February 1859, consisted of 129 appearances in 49 different\ntowns throughout England, Scotland and Ireland.[97] Dickens's continued\nfascination with the theatrical world was written into the theatre scenes in\n_Nicholas Nickleby_ , but more importantly he found an outlet in public\nreadings. In 1866, he undertook a series of public readings in England and\nScotland, with more the following year in England and Ireland.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Dickens_by_Watkins_1858.png/170px-\nDickens_by_Watkins_1858.png)](/wiki/File:Dickens_by_Watkins_1858.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dickens_by_Watkins_1858.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nDickens at his desk, 1858\n\nMajor works soon followed, including _[A Tale of Two\nCities](/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities \"A Tale of Two Cities\")_ (1859) and _[Great\nExpectations](/wiki/Great_Expectations \"Great Expectations\")_ (1861), which\nwere resounding successes. During this time he was also the publisher, editor,\nand a major contributor to the journals _Household Words_ (1850–1859) and\n_[All the Year Round](/wiki/All_the_Year_Round \"All the Year Round\")_\n(1858–1870).[98]\n\nIn early September 1860, in a field behind Gad's Hill, Dickens made a bonfire\nof most of his correspondence—only those letters on business matters were\nspared. Since Ellen Ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her,[99] the\nextent of the affair between the two remains speculative.[100] In the 1930s,\nThomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself to a Canon Benham,\nand gave currency to rumours they had been lovers.[101] That the two had a son\nwho died in infancy was alleged by Dickens's daughter, Kate Perugini, whom\nGladys Storey had interviewed before her death in 1929. Storey published her\naccount in _Dickens and Daughter_ ,[102][103] but no contemporary evidence\nexists. On his death, Dickens settled an [annuity](/wiki/Life_annuity \"Life\nannuity\") on Ternan which made her a financially independent woman. [Claire\nTomalin](/wiki/Claire_Tomalin \"Claire Tomalin\")'s book, _The Invisible Woman_\n, argues that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his\nlife. The book was subsequently turned into a play, _Little Nell_ , by [Simon\nGray](/wiki/Simon_Gray \"Simon Gray\"), and [a 2013\nfilm](/wiki/The_Invisible_Woman_\\(2013_film\\) \"The Invisible Woman \\(2013\nfilm\\)\"). In the same period, Dickens furthered his interest in the\n[paranormal](/wiki/Paranormal \"Paranormal\"), becoming one of the early members\nof [The Ghost Club](/wiki/The_Ghost_Club \"The Ghost Club\").[104]\n\nIn June 1862, he was offered £10,000 for a reading tour of Australia.[105] He\nwas enthusiastic, and even planned a travel book, _The Uncommercial Traveller\nUpside Down_ , but ultimately decided against the tour.[106] Two of his sons,\n[Alfred D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens](/wiki/Alfred_D%27Orsay_Tennyson_Dickens\n\"Alfred D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens\") and [Edward Bulwer Lytton\nDickens](/wiki/Edward_Dickens \"Edward Dickens\"), migrated to Australia, Edward\nbecoming a member of the [Parliament of New South\nWales](/wiki/Parliament_of_New_South_Wales \"Parliament of New South Wales\") as\n[Member for Wilcannia](/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Wilcannia \"Electoral\ndistrict of Wilcannia\") between 1889 and 1894.[107][108]\n\n## Last years\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Staplehurst_rail_crash.jpg/220px-\nStaplehurst_rail_crash.jpg)](/wiki/File:Staplehurst_rail_crash.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Staplehurst_rail_crash.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAfter the [Staplehurst rail crash](/wiki/Staplehurst_rail_crash \"Staplehurst\nrail crash\")\n\nOn 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was\ninvolved in the [Staplehurst rail crash](/wiki/Staplehurst_rail_crash\n\"Staplehurst rail crash\"). The train's first seven carriages plunged off a\n[cast iron](/wiki/Cast_iron \"Cast iron\") bridge that was under repair. The\nonly [first-class](/wiki/First_class_travel \"First class travel\") carriage to\nremain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before\nrescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with\na flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water, and saved some lives. Before\nleaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for _[Our Mutual\nFriend](/wiki/Our_Mutual_Friend \"Our Mutual Friend\")_ , and he returned to his\ncarriage to retrieve it.[109] Dickens later used this experience as material\nfor his short [ghost story](/wiki/Ghost_story \"Ghost story\"), \"[The Signal-\nMan](/wiki/The_Signal-Man \"The Signal-Man\")\", in which the central character\nhas a premonition of his own death in a rail crash.

His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his\nhonour at [Delmonico's](/wiki/Delmonico%27s_Restaurant \"Delmonico's\nRestaurant\") on 18 April, when he promised never to denounce America again. By\nthe end of the tour Dickens could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on\nchampagne and eggs beaten in sherry. On 23 April he boarded the\n[Cunard](/wiki/Cunard \"Cunard\") liner [_Russia_](/wiki/SS_Russia_\\(1867\\) \"SS\nRussia \\(1867\\)\") to return to Britain,[113] barely escaping a [Federal Tax\nLien](/wiki/Tax_lien \"Tax lien\") against the proceeds of his lecture\ntour.[114]\n\n## Farewell readings\n\nBetween 1868 and 1869, Dickens gave a series of \"farewell readings\" in\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland, beginning on 6 October. He managed, of a\ncontracted 100 readings, to deliver 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in\nLondon.[111] As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of\nparalysis. He suffered a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester.[115] He collapsed\non 22 April 1869, at [Preston](/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire \"Preston,\nLancashire\") in Lancashire, and on doctor's advice, the tour was\ncancelled.[116] After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began\nwork on his final novel, _[The Mystery of Edwin\nDrood](/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\")_. It was\nfashionable in the 1860s to 'do the slums' and, in company, Dickens visited\n[opium dens](/wiki/Opium_den \"Opium den\") in [Shadwell](/wiki/Shadwell\n\"Shadwell\"), where he witnessed an elderly addict known as\n\"[Laskar](/wiki/Lascar \"Lascar\") Sal\", who formed the model for the \"Opium\nSal\" subsequently featured in his mystery novel, _Edwin Drood_.[117]\n\nAfter Dickens had regained sufficient strength, he arranged, with medical\napproval, for a final series of readings to partially make up to his sponsors\nwhat they had lost due to his illness. There were to be 12 performances,\nrunning between 11 January and 15 March 1870, the last at 8:00 pm at [St.\nJames's Hall](/wiki/St._James%27s_Hall \"St. James's Hall\") in London. Although\nin grave health by this time, he read _A Christmas Carol_ and _The Trial from\nPickwick_.

He never regained consciousness, and the next day, five\nyears to the day after the Staplehurst rail crash, he died at Gads Hill Place.\nBiographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when\nhe suffered the stroke, and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him\ntaken back to Gad's Hill so the public would not know the truth about their\nrelationship.[120] Contrary to his wish to be buried at [Rochester\nCathedral](/wiki/Rochester_Cathedral \"Rochester Cathedral\") \"in an\ninexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner\",[121] he was laid to\nrest in the [Poets' Corner](/wiki/Poets%27_Corner \"Poets' Corner\") of\n[Westminster Abbey](/wiki/Westminster_Abbey \"Westminster Abbey\"). A printed\nepitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads:\n\n> To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at\n> his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9 June 1870, aged 58 years. He\n> was a sympathiser with the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed; and by\n> his death, one of England's greatest writers is lost to the world.[122]\n\nHis last words were: \"On the ground\", in response to his sister-in-law\nGeorgina's request that he lie down.[123][nb 1] On Sunday, 19 June 1870, five\ndays after Dickens was buried in the Abbey, Dean [Arthur Penrhyn\nStanley](/wiki/Arthur_Penrhyn_Stanley \"Arthur Penrhyn Stanley\") delivered a\nmemorial elegy, lauding \"the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn\",\nfor showing by his own example \"that even in dealing with the darkest scenes\nand the most degraded characters, genius could still be clean, and mirth could\nbe innocent\". Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave,\nStanley assured those present that \"the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one\nwith both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of\nliterature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English\ntongue.\"[124]\n\nIn his will, drafted more than a year before his death, Dickens left the care\nof his £80,000 estate to his longtime colleague John Forster and his \"best and\ntruest friend\" Georgina Hogarth who, along with Dickens's two sons, also\nreceived a tax-free sum of £8,000 (about £800,000 in present terms). Although\nDickens and his wife had been separated for several years at the time of his\ndeath, he provided her with an annual income of £600 and made her similar\nallowances in his will. He also bequeathed £19 19s to each servant in his\nemployment at the time of his death.[125]\n\n## Literary style\n\nDickens favoured the style of the 18th century picaresque novels that he found\nin abundance on his father's shelves. According to Ackroyd, other than these,\nperhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the\nfables of _The Arabian Nights_.[126]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Dickens_dream.jpg/220px-\nDickens_dream.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dickens_dream.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dickens_dream.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Dickens 's Dream_ by [Robert William Buss](/wiki/Robert_William_Buss \"Robert\nWilliam Buss\"), portraying Dickens at his desk at [Gads Hill\nPlace](/wiki/Gads_Hill_Place \"Gads Hill Place\") surrounded by many of his\ncharacters\n\nHis writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity.[127] Satire,\nflourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer\ncompared him to [Hogarth](/wiki/William_Hogarth \"William Hogarth\") for his\nkeen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed\nmastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of\ncontemporary popular theatre.[128] Dickens worked intensively on developing\narresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations\nfor his readers, and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving\nwhat one critic calls an \"allegorical impetus\" to the novels' meanings.[127]\nTo cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr. Murdstone in _David\nCopperfield_ conjures up twin allusions to \"murder\" and stony coldness.[129]\nHis literary style is also a mixture of [fantasy](/wiki/Fantasy \"Fantasy\") and\n[realism](/wiki/Realism_\\(arts\\) \"Realism \\(arts\\)\"). His satires of British\naristocratic snobbery—he calls one character the \"Noble Refrigerator\"—are\noften popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats, or\ndinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights\nof fancy.\n\nThe author worked closely with his illustrators, supplying them with a summary\nof the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings\nwere exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for\neach month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. [Marcus\nStone](/wiki/Marcus_Stone \"Marcus Stone\"), illustrator of _Our Mutual Friend_\n, recalled that the author was always \"ready to describe down to the minutest\ndetails the personal characteristics, and ... life-history of the creations of\nhis fancy\".[130]\n\n### Characters\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Charles_Dickens_characters.jpg/220px-\nCharles_Dickens_characters.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charles_Dickens_characters.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charles_Dickens_characters.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDickens' characters\n\nDickens's biographer [Claire Tomalin](/wiki/Claire_Tomalin \"Claire Tomalin\")\nregards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after\n[Shakespeare](/wiki/Shakespeare \"Shakespeare\").[131] Dickensian\n[characters](/wiki/List_of_Dickensian_characters \"List of Dickensian\ncharacters\") are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially\nso because of their typically whimsical names.

The scenes of interminable court cases and legal\narguments in _Bleak House_ reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and\ncourt reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's\nprocedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of\ncopyright.[138] Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became\na common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in\nthe Marshalsea prison in _Little Dorrit_ resulting from Dickens's own\nexperiences of the institution.[139] Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart,\nmay have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly\nin _David Copperfield_ and Lucie Manette in _A Tale of Two Cities._[140][nb 2]\nDickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed\nof them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic\naccounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six\nyears after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which\nDickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some\ncritics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character,\nwhich he sought to exorcise by self-parody.[141]\n\n### Episodic writing\n\nMost of Dickens's major novels were first written in monthly or weekly\ninstalments in journals such as _Master Humphrey 's Clock_ and _Household\nWords_ , later reprinted in book form. These instalments made the stories\naffordable and accessible, and the series of regular [cliff-\nhangers](/wiki/Cliffhanger \"Cliffhanger\") made each new episode widely\nanticipated. When _The Old Curiosity Shop_ was being serialised, American fans\nwaited at the docks in [New York harbor](/wiki/New_York_harbor \"New York\nharbor\"), shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little\nNell dead?\"[142] Dickens's talent was to incorporate this episodic writing\nstyle but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Charles_Dickens%2C_public_reading%2C_1867.jpg/220px-\nCharles_Dickens%2C_public_reading%2C_1867.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charles_Dickens,_public_reading,_1867.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charles_Dickens,_public_reading,_1867.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.\" Wood engraving from _[Harper's\nWeekly](/wiki/Harper%27s_Weekly \"Harper's Weekly\")_, 7 December 1867\n\nAnother important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his\nexposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a\nsignificant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond\nmatters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist\nexaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in\n_The Old Curiosity Shop_), and made suggestions about plot and character. It\nwas he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in _Oliver Twist_.\nDickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised\nhim to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the\nheroine.[143]\n\nDickens's serialisation of his novels was not uncriticised by other authors.\nIn [Robert Louis Stevenson](/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson \"Robert Louis\nStevenson\")'s novel _[The Wrecker](/wiki/The_Wrecker_\\(Stevenson_novel\\) \"The\nWrecker \\(Stevenson novel\\)\")_ , there is a comment by Captain Nares,\ninvestigating an abandoned ship: \"See! They were writing up the log,\" said\nNares, pointing to the ink-bottle. \"Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if\nthere ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He\ngenerally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens\nand his serial novels.\"\n\n### Social commentary\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Martin_Chuzzlewit_illus11.jpg/170px-\nMartin_Chuzzlewit_illus11.jpg)](/wiki/File:Martin_Chuzzlewit_illus11.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Martin_Chuzzlewit_illus11.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNurse [Sarah Gamp](/wiki/Sarah_Gamp \"Sarah Gamp\") (left) from _Martin\nChuzzlewit_ became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the\nearly Victorian era, before the reforms of [Florence\nNightingale](/wiki/Florence_Nightingale \"Florence Nightingale\")\n\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of [social\ncommentary](/wiki/Social_commentary \"Social commentary\"). He was a fierce\ncritic of the poverty and [social stratification](/wiki/Social_stratification\n\"Social stratification\") of [Victorian](/wiki/Victorian_era \"Victorian era\")\nsociety. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows\nquite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\".[144]\nDickens's second novel, _Oliver Twist_ (1839), shocked readers with its images\nof poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals,\nmaking impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty\nentailed.[145][146]\n\n### Literary techniques\n\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly\nsentimental scenes to contrast with his [caricatures](/wiki/Caricature\n\"Caricature\") and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent\nin _The Old Curiosity Shop_ (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by\ncontemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by [Oscar\nWilde](/wiki/Oscar_Wilde \"Oscar Wilde\"). \"You would need to have a heart of\nstone\", he declared in one of his famous witticisms, \"not to laugh at the\ndeath of little Nell.\"[147] [G. K. Chesterton](/wiki/G._K._Chesterton \"G. K.\nChesterton\"), stated: \"It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of\nlittle Nell, that I object to\", arguing that the maudlin effect of his\ndescription of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief,\nhis \"despotic\" use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like\nthis.[148]\n\nThe question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the\n[sentimental novel](/wiki/Sentimental_novel \"Sentimental novel\") is debatable.\nValerie Purton, in her recent _Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition_ , sees\nhim continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \"sentimental\nscenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as\nhis darker or comic figures and scenes\", and that \"_Dombey and Son_ is [ ... ]\nDickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\".[149] The\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_ online comments that, despite \"patches of emotional\nexcess\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in _A Christmas Carol_ (1843),\n\"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\".[150]\n\nIn _Oliver Twist_ Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy\nso inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by\neither brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young\n[pickpockets](/wiki/Pickpocketing \"Pickpocketing\"). While later novels also\ncentre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in _Bleak House_ and Amy\nDorrit in _Little Dorrit_), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's\ngoal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he\nbelieved to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either\nfor comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.[151] For example,\nOliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that\nrescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a\nstaple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's _[Tom\nJones](/wiki/The_History_of_Tom_Jones,_a_Foundling \"The History of Tom Jones,\na Foundling\"),_ which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.[152]\n\n## Reception\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Ottawa_Public_Library.jpg/220px-\nOttawa_Public_Library.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ottawa_Public_Library.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ottawa_Public_Library.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDickens portrait (top left), in between Shakespeare and Tennyson, on a stained\nglass window at the [Ottawa Public Library](/wiki/Ottawa_Public_Library\n\"Ottawa Public Library\"), Ottawa, Canada\n\nDickens was the most popular novelist of his time,[153] and remains one of the\nbest-known and most-read of English authors. His works have never gone [out of\nprint](/wiki/Out-of-print_book \"Out-of-print book\"),[154] and have been\nadapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema,[155] with at\nleast 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's works\ndocumented.[156] Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own\nlifetime, and as early as 1913, a silent film of _The Pickwick Papers_ was\nmade.[157] He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and\nis regarded as the greatest novelist of the [Victorian\nera](/wiki/Victorian_era \"Victorian era\").[1]\n\nAmong fellow writers, Dickens has been both lionised and mocked. [Leo\nTolstoy](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy \"Leo Tolstoy\"), G. K. Chesterton, and [George\nOrwell](/wiki/George_Orwell \"George Orwell\") praised his realism, comic voice,\nprose fluency, and satiric caricature, as well as his [passionate\nadvocacy](/wiki/Child_labour#Historical \"Child labour\") on behalf of children\nand the poor. French writer [Jules Verne](/wiki/Jules_Verne \"Jules Verne\")\ncalled Dickens his favourite writer, writing his novels \"stand alone, dwarfing\nall others by their amazing power and felicity of expression.\"[158] Dutch\npainter [Vincent van Gogh](/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh \"Vincent van Gogh\") was\ninspired by Dickens's novels in several of his paintings like _Vincent 's\nChair_ and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens,\nespecially _A Christmas Carol_ , was one of the things that was keeping him\nfrom committing suicide.[159] Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction\nof character, while admiring his gift for caricature.[160] His late\ncontemporary [William Wordsworth](/wiki/William_Wordsworth \"William\nWordsworth\"), by then [Poet laureate](/wiki/Poet_laureate \"Poet laureate\"),\nthought him a \"very talkative, vulgar young person\", adding he had not read a\nline of his work; Dickens in return thought Wordsworth \"a dreadful Old\nAss\".[161] Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him \"the\ngreatest of superficial novelists\": Dickens failed to endow his characters\nwith psychological depth and the novels, \"loose baggy monsters\",[162] betrayed\na \"cavalier organisation\".[163] [Virginia Woolf](/wiki/Virginia_Woolf\n\"Virginia Woolf\") had a love-hate relationship with his works, finding his\nnovels \"mesmerizing\" while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a\ncommonplace style.[164] [Fyodor Dostoyevsky](/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky \"Fyodor\nDostoyevsky\") expressed his admiration for the author, \"We understand Dickens\nin Russia, I am convinced, almost as well as the English, perhaps even with\nall the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots\ndo. And yet how original is Dickens, and how very English!\".[165]\n\n_A Christmas Carol_ is most probably his best-known story, with frequent new\nadaptations. It is also the most-filmed of Dickens's stories, with many\nversions dating from the early years of cinema.[166] According to the\nhistorian [Ronald Hutton](/wiki/Ronald_Hutton \"Ronald Hutton\"), the current\nstate of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian\nrevival of the holiday spearheaded by _A Christmas Carol_. Dickens catalysed\nthe emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast\nto the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new\nmiddle-class expectations arose.[167] Its archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny\nTim, the Christmas ghosts) entered into Western cultural consciousness. A\nprominent phrase from the tale, \"[Merry\nChristmas](/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season#History_of_the_phrase \"Christmas\nand holiday season\")\", was popularised following the appearance of the\nstory.[168] The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, and his dismissive\nexclamation ['Bah! Humbug!'](/wiki/Humbug \"Humbug\") likewise gained currency\nas an idiom.[169] Novelist [William Makepeace\nThackeray](/wiki/William_Makepeace_Thackeray \"William Makepeace Thackeray\")\ncalled the book \"a national benefit, and to every man and woman who reads it a\npersonal kindness\".[166]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Bleak-house-\nbroadstairs.jpg/220px-Bleak-house-broadstairs.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bleak-house-\nbroadstairs.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bleak-house-broadstairs.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Bleak House](/wiki/Bleak_House,_Broadstairs \"Bleak House, Broadstairs\") in\n[Broadstairs](/wiki/Broadstairs \"Broadstairs\"), Kent, where Dickens wrote some\nof his novels\n\nAt a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the\nworld, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged\nwithin society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues—such\nas [sanitation](/wiki/Sanitation \"Sanitation\") and the\n[workhouse](/wiki/Workhouse \"Workhouse\")—but his fiction probably demonstrated\nits greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class\ninequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor\nand condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such\nabuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of\nthis condition is in _Hard Times_ (1854), Dickens's only novel-length\ntreatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and\nsatire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed \"Hands\"\nby the factory owners; that is, not really \"people\" but rather only appendages\nof the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular\njournalists and political figures, to address such problems of class\noppression. For example, the prison scenes in _The Pickwick Papers_ are\nclaimed to have been influential in having the [Fleet\nPrison](/wiki/Fleet_Prison \"Fleet Prison\") shut down. [Karl\nMarx](/wiki/Karl_Marx \"Karl Marx\") asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world\nmore political and social truths than have been uttered by all the\nprofessional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\".[170] [George\nBernard Shaw](/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw \"George Bernard Shaw\") even remarked\nthat _Great Expectations_ was more seditious than Marx's _[Das\nKapital](/wiki/Das_Kapital \"Das Kapital\")_.[170] The exceptional popularity of\nDickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (_Bleak House_\n, 1853; _Little Dorrit_ , 1857; _Our Mutual Friend_ , 1865), not only\nunderscored his almost preternatural ability to create compelling storylines\nand unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public\nconfronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has\nbeen argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly\nsuperfluity of material' that, in the gradual dénouement, yields up an\nunsuspected order, influenced the organisation of [Charles\nDarwin](/wiki/Charles_Darwin \"Charles Darwin\")'s _[On the Origin of\nSpecies](/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species \"On the Origin of Species\")_.[171]\n\n## Influence and legacy\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Dickens_and_Nell_Philly.JPG/170px-\nDickens_and_Nell_Philly.JPG)](/wiki/File:Dickens_and_Nell_Philly.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dickens_and_Nell_Philly.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[_Dickens and Little Nell_](/wiki/Dickens_and_Little_Nell_\\(Elwell\\) \"Dickens\nand Little Nell \\(Elwell\\)\") statue in [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia\n\"Philadelphia\"), Pennsylvania\n\nMuseums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many\nplaces with which Dickens was associated.

The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as\nwell as printers' proofs, first editions, and illustrations from the\ncollection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the [Victoria and\nAlbert Museum](/wiki/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum \"Victoria and Albert\nMuseum\").[172] Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his\nhonour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled _[Dickens\nand Little Nell](/wiki/Dickens_and_Little_Nell_\\(Elwell\\) \"Dickens and Little\nNell \\(Elwell\\)\")_ , cast in 1891 by [Francis Edwin\nElwell](/wiki/Francis_Edwin_Elwell \"Francis Edwin Elwell\"), stands in [Clark\nPark](/wiki/Clark_Park \"Clark Park\") in the [Spruce\nHill](/wiki/Spruce_Hill,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania \"Spruce Hill,\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\") neighbourhood of\n[Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\"), Pennsylvania. Another life-\nsize statue of Dickens is located at [Centennial\nPark](/wiki/Centennial_Park,_New_South_Wales \"Centennial Park, New South\nWales\"), Sydney, Australia.[173] In 2014, a life-size statue was unveiled near\nhis birthplace in Portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth; this was\nsupported by the author's great-great grandsons, Ian and [Gerald\nDickens](/wiki/Gerald_Charles_Dickens_\\(actor\\) \"Gerald Charles Dickens\n\\(actor\\)\").[174][175]\n\nDickens was commemorated on the [Series E £10\nnote](/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling \"Banknotes of the pound sterling\")\nissued by the [Bank of England](/wiki/Bank_of_England_note_issues \"Bank of\nEngland note issues\") that circulated between 1992 and 2003.
