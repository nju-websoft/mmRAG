A founder of the [Democratic\nParty](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Democratic_Party \"History of the\nUnited States Democratic Party\"), he held a number of senior positions in the\n[U.S. Federal Government](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States\n\"Federal government of the United States\"), including\n[eighth](/wiki/List_of_Vice_Presidents_of_the_United_States \"List of Vice\nPresidents of the United States\") [Vice\nPresident](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States \"Vice President of the\nUnited States\") (1833–1837) and\n[tenth](/wiki/List_of_Secretaries_of_State_of_the_United_States \"List of\nSecretaries of State of the United States\") [Secretary of\nState](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United States Secretary of\nState\") (1829–1831), both under [Andrew Jackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew\nJackson\"). Van Buren won the presidency by promising to continue Jackson's\npolicies. The [Panic of 1837](/wiki/Panic_of_1837 \"Panic of 1837\") which\nstruck the nation combined with the growing political strength of the\nopposition [Whig Party](/wiki/Whig_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Whig Party\n\\(United States\\)\") led to his defeat when he ran for reelection. During his\nhalf-century of public service, he built and perfected a new system of\npolitical parties at first the [state](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S. state\") and then\nthe [federal](/wiki/United_States_federal_government \"United States federal\ngovernment\") level; at the end of his life, he was seen as a major figure of\nthe [abolitionist movement](/wiki/Abolitionism \"Abolitionism\") defending\n[Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\")'s policies during\nthe American Civil War. Van Buren was the first President of the United States\nto be born a [United States citizen](/wiki/Natural-born-citizen_clause\n\"Natural-born-citizen clause\").[4] Of [Dutch descent](/wiki/Dutch_Americans\n\"Dutch Americans\"), he is the only U.S. President who spoke [English as a\nsecond language](/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language \"English as a\nsecond or foreign language\").\n\nA delegate to a political convention at age 18, he quickly moved from local to\nstate politics, gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished\nlawyer. Elected to the U.S. Senate by the [New York State\nLegislature](/wiki/New_York_State_Legislature \"New York State Legislature\") in\n1821, he reorganized the [Democratic-Republican Party](/wiki/Democratic-\nRepublican_Party \"Democratic-Republican Party\") in [New\nYork](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New York \\(state\\)\") and established the\n[Albany Regency](/wiki/Albany_Regency \"Albany Regency\") to keep it in power.\nVan Buren supported [William H. Crawford](/wiki/William_H._Crawford \"William\nH. Crawford\") for President in the [1824\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824 \"United States\npresidential election, 1824\"). [John Quincy Adams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams\n\"John Quincy Adams\") was then made president in a [contingent\nelection](/wiki/Contingent_election \"Contingent election\"). The supporters of\nJackson, who had won a plurality of the popular and electoral vote, coalesced\naround Jackson to create the new Democratic Party. Van Buren, alarmed by the\nnationalist policies of the Adams administration, soon joined them. Van Buren\nwas a major supporter and organizer for Jackson in the [1828\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1828 \"United States\npresidential election, 1828\"), and ran for [Governor of New\nYork](/wiki/Governor_of_New_York \"Governor of New York\") in the hope of using\nhis personal popularity to boost Jackson's campaign. Jackson and Van Buren\nwere elected, and after serving as governor for two months, Van Buren resigned\nto become Jackson's [Secretary of\nState](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United States Secretary of\nState\"). During Jackson's eight years as President, Van Buren was a key\nadvisor, and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic\nParty, particularly in New York. He resigned as Secretary of State in 1831 to\nhelp resolve the [Petticoat affair](/wiki/Petticoat_affair \"Petticoat\naffair\"). Jackson gave Van Buren a [recess\nappointment](/wiki/Recess_appointment \"Recess appointment\") as [American\nMinister to Britain](/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Kingdom\n\"United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom\"). Van Buren's nomination was\nrejected by the Senate, cutting short his service in London, but he was\nelected Vice President in the [1832\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1832 \"United States\npresidential election, 1832\").\n\nWith Jackson's strong support, Van Buren faced little opposition for the\npresidential nomination at the [1835 Democratic National\nConvention](/wiki/1835_Democratic_National_Convention \"1835 Democratic\nNational Convention\"), and he defeated several Whig opponents in the [1836\npresidential election](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1836 \"United\nStates presidential election, 1836\"). As President, Van Buren was blamed for\nthe depression of 1837; hostile newspapers called him \"Martin Van Ruin\". He\nattempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in\nan [independent treasury](/wiki/Independent_Treasury \"Independent Treasury\"),\nrather than in state banks, but Congress would not approve of this until 1840.\nIn foreign affairs, he denied the application of [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\")\nfor admission to the Union, unwilling to upset the balance of free and slave\nstates in the [Missouri Compromise](/wiki/Missouri_Compromise \"Missouri\nCompromise\"), and hoping to avoid war with Mexico over [Texas\nannexation](/wiki/Texas_annexation \"Texas annexation\"). Additionally,\nrelations with Britain and its colonies in [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\")\nproved to be strained from the bloodless [Aroostook War](/wiki/Aroostook_War\n\"Aroostook War\") and the [_Caroline_ Affair](/wiki/Caroline_affair \"Caroline\naffair\"). In the [1840\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1840 \"United States\npresidential election, 1840\"), Van Buren was voted out of office, losing to\nWhig candidate [William Henry Harrison](/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison \"William\nHenry Harrison\").\n\nVan Buren was the leading candidate for the [Democratic nomination in\n1844](/wiki/1844_Democratic_National_Convention \"1844 Democratic National\nConvention\"), but his continued opposition to the annexation of Texas caused\nhim to lose to [James K. Polk](/wiki/James_K._Polk \"James K. Polk\"), who [went\non to win the election](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1844\n\"United States presidential election, 1844\"). In the [1848\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1848 \"United States\npresidential election, 1848\"), Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate\nof the anti-slavery [Free Soil Party](/wiki/Free_Soil_Party \"Free Soil\nParty\"). He returned to the Democratic fold to endorse [Franklin\nPierce](/wiki/Franklin_Pierce \"Franklin Pierce\") (1852), [James\nBuchanan](/wiki/James_Buchanan \"James Buchanan\") (1856), and [Stephen A.\nDouglas](/wiki/Stephen_A._Douglas \"Stephen A. Douglas\") (1860) for the\npresidency. His increasingly [abolitionist](/wiki/Abolitionism \"Abolitionism\")\nviews and support for the [Union](/wiki/Union_\\(American_Civil_War\\) \"Union\n\\(American Civil War\\)\") led him to support [Abraham\nLincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\") after the start of the\nAmerican Civil War. Van Buren's health began to fail in 1861, and he died in\nJuly 1862 at age 79. He has been [generally\nranked](/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States\n\"Historical rankings of presidents of the United States\") as a below-average\npresident.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Early life and education\n  * 2 Early political career\n    * 2.1 U.S. Senate and national politics\n  * 3 Secretary of State\n    * 3.1 Petticoat affair\n  * 4 Vice-Presidency\n  * 5 Presidential election of 1836\n  * 6 Presidency 1837–1841\n    * 6.1 White House hostess\n    * 6.2 Panic of 1837\n    * 6.3 Indian removals\n    * 6.4 Mormons\n    * 6.5 Texas\n    * 6.6 British North America\n    * 6.7 _United States v.

The future president was [baptized](/wiki/Baptized \"Baptized\") on\nDecember 15, 1782, as \"Maarten Van Buren\", the original Dutch spelling of his\nname.

He accepted their\nadvice and patterned his clothing, appearance, bearing and conduct after\ntheirs.[32][33] After six years under the Silvesters, the elder Silvester and\nDemocratic-Republican political figure [John Peter Van\nNess](/wiki/John_Peter_Van_Ness \"John Peter Van Ness\") suggested that Van\nBuren's political leanings constrained him to complete his education with a\nDemocratic-Republican attorney.

Van\nBuren supported [Daniel D.

Tompkins](/wiki/Daniel_D._Tompkins \"Daniel D.\nTompkins\").[45]\n\nThough he never served in the military, during the [War of\n1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\") Van Buren worked in the State Senate to\npass war measures, including bills to expand the [New York\nMilitia](/wiki/New_York_Army_National_Guard \"New York Army National Guard\")\nand increase soldier pay. In addition, he was a special judge advocate\nappointed to serve as a prosecutor of [William Hull](/wiki/William_Hull\n\"William Hull\") during Hull's court-martial following the surrender of\n[Detroit](/wiki/Detroit,_Michigan \"Detroit, Michigan\").[46][47] In the winter\nof 1814–15 he collaborated with [Winfield Scott](/wiki/Winfield_Scott\n\"Winfield Scott\") on ways to reorganize the New York Militia in anticipation\nof another military campaign in 1815. The reorganization would have included a\nposition for Van Buren at a rank to be determined, but the war's end in\nFebruary 1815 ended their work on the project.[48]\n\nHe initially opposed DeWitt Clinton's plan for the [Erie\nCanal](/wiki/Erie_Canal \"Erie Canal\"), but relented when the\n[Bucktails](/wiki/Bucktails \"Bucktails\"), the anti-DeWitt Clinton Democratic-\nRepublicans, were able to gain a majority on the [Erie Canal\nCommission](/wiki/Erie_Canal_Commission \"Erie Canal Commission\"); he supported\na bill to finance its construction through the sale of state bonds.[49]\n\nFrom 1816 to 1829, Van Buren served as a member of the [University of the\nState of New York](/wiki/University_of_the_State_of_New_York \"University of\nthe State of New York\") Board of Regents.[50] In 1817, Van Buren's connection\nwith so-called \"machine politics\" started when he created the first political\norganization encompassing all of New York, the Bucktails.[51] The Bucktails\nsucceeded in emphasizing party loyalty and used it to capture and control many\npatronage posts throughout New York. Van Buren gained the nickname of \"Little\nMagician\" for the skill with which he exploited the \"[spoils\nsystem](/wiki/Spoils_system \"Spoils system\")\". He was a member of the 1820\nstate [constitutional\nconvention](/wiki/Constitutional_convention_\\(political_meeting\\)\n\"Constitutional convention \\(political meeting\\)\"), where he favored expanded\nvoting rights, but opposed universal suffrage and tried to maintain property\nrequirements for voting.[52]\n\nHe was the leading figure in the [Albany Regency](/wiki/Albany_Regency \"Albany\nRegency\"), a group of Bucktail leaders who for more than a generation\ndominated New York politics and influenced national politics. The Regency,\ntogether with other political organizations such as [Tammany\nHall](/wiki/Tammany_Hall \"Tammany Hall\"), played a major role in expanding the\nspoils system and making it a recognized and accepted procedure. While\norganizing and overseeing the operations of the Regency, Van Buren resided in\n[Albany](/wiki/Albany,_New_York \"Albany, New York\"); his housemate was [Roger\nSkinner](/wiki/Roger_Skinner \"Roger Skinner\"), a lifelong bachelor who was\nalso a key Van Buren lieutenant in the State Senate and as Judge of the\n[United States District Court for the Northern District of New\nYork](/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_New_York\n\"United States District Court for the Northern District of New York\").[53] Van\nBuren was the prime architect of the first nationwide political party: the\n[Jacksonian Democrats](/wiki/Jacksonian_Democrats \"Jacksonian Democrats\") or\n[Democratic Party](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party\n\\(United States\\)\"), which evolved from the Democratic-Republicans and relied\non party loyalty and patronage to prevent contentious sectional issues,\nincluding tariffs and slavery, from becoming national crises. In Van Buren's\nwords, \"Without strong national political organizations, there would be\nnothing to moderate the prejudices between free and slaveholding states.\"[54]\nAs had [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\") and other\nDemocratic Party organizers who favored [states'\nrights](/wiki/States%27_rights \"States' rights\") and local control, Van Buren\nwas struggling to find an institutional solution to the Constitution's seeming\ninability to prevent concentration of power in an [administrative\nrepublic](/wiki/Administrative_republic \"Administrative republic\").[55]\n\nEarly in his life Van Buren owned a slave, a man named Tom who served as his\npersonal valet. Tom ran away in 1814 and eventually settled in\n[Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\"), with Van Buren making no effort to locate\nhim. In 1824 Tom was found to be living in [Worcester,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts \"Worcester, Massachusetts\").\nSince he still legally owned Tom (under New York's gradual emancipation law,\nslavery was scheduled to be completely abolished in the state in 1827), Van\nBuren privately agreed to sell Tom to the finder for $50, provided the finder,\na resident of [Rensselaer County](/wiki/Rensselaer_County,_New_York\n\"Rensselaer County, New York\"), could guarantee that Tom would be captured\nwithout violence. He could not make such a guarantee, and his willingness to\npay was lessened by the knowledge that Tom would be emancipated in fewer than\nthree years even if he was re-enslaved, so Tom remained free, as Van Buren\nprobably intended. (Allowing Tom to remain in Massachusetts unmolested without\nnotice enabled Van Buren to avoid offending southern slave owners, as he would\ndo if he publicly allowed a former slave to remain free. At the same time, he\navoided offending northern abolitionists, which he would do if he captured and\nre-enslaved a former slave.)[56][_[self-published\nsource](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_][57]\n\n### U.S. Senate and national\npolitics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: U.S. Senate and national politics\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/MVanBuren.png/260px-\nMVanBuren.png)](/wiki/File:MVanBuren.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MVanBuren.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nGubernatorial [portrait](/wiki/Portrait \"Portrait\") of Martin Van Buren by\n[Daniel Huntington](/wiki/Daniel_Huntington_\\(artist\\) \"Daniel Huntington\n\\(artist\\)\")\n\nIn [February 1821](/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_New_York,_1821\n\"United States Senate election in New York, 1821\") Van Buren was elected a\n[U.S. Senator from New York](/wiki/U.S._Senator_from_New_York \"U.S. Senator\nfrom New York\"), defeating incumbent [Nathan Sanford](/wiki/Nathan_Sanford\n\"Nathan Sanford\"), who ran as the [Clintonian](/wiki/DeWitt_Clinton \"DeWitt\nClinton\") candidate.[58] Van Buren initially favored [internal\nimprovements](/wiki/Internal_improvements \"Internal improvements\"), such as\nroad repairs and canal construction; he proposed a constitutional amendment in\n1824 to authorize such undertakings, but changed his position the following\nyear. He voted for the [tariffs](/wiki/Tariff_in_American_history \"Tariff in\nAmerican history\") of 1824 and 1828, and then gradually abandoned this\nprotectionist position, later supporting tariffs \"for revenue only.\"[59]\n\nIn the [presidential election of\n1824](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824 \"United States\npresidential election, 1824\"), Van Buren supported the nominee of a\nCongressional caucus, Treasury Secretary [William H.\nCrawford](/wiki/William_H._Crawford \"William H. Crawford\"), and received the\nelectoral votes of [Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._state\\) \"Georgia \\(U.S.\nstate\\)\") for [Vice\nPresident](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States_of_America \"Vice\nPresident of the United States of America\"). None of the presidential\ncandidates—Crawford, [John Quincy Adams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John Quincy\nAdams\"), [Andrew Jackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\"), or [Henry\nClay](/wiki/Henry_Clay \"Henry Clay\")—had received a majority of the electoral\ncollege votes, so [the choice\nfell](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1824#1825_Contingent_election\n\"United States presidential election, 1824\") to the [United States House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\"). The House had to choose from among the top three\ncandidates, so Clay was eliminated. Van Buren had originally hoped to block\n[John Quincy Adams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John Quincy Adams\") by denying\nhim the state of New York, which was divided between supporters of Crawford\nand Adams. However, Representative [Stephen Van\nRensselaer](/wiki/Stephen_Van_Rensselaer \"Stephen Van Rensselaer\") swung New\nYork to Adams. Adams won, and appointed Clay as Secretary of State. Because\nClay had supported Adams in the House election, Jackson and Crawford\nsupporters alleged corruption.[60] After the House contest, Van Buren shrewdly\nkept out of [the controversy which\nfollowed](/wiki/Corrupt_Bargain#Election_of_1824 \"Corrupt Bargain\"), and began\nlooking forward to 1828. He switched his support early from Crawford, whose\nill health after a stroke had made him a less than viable candidate, to\n[Andrew Jackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\"), who had won the\npopular vote in 1824. Jackson was angered to see the presidency go to Adams\nafter he received fewer popular votes, and eagerly looked forward to a\nrematch.[61]\n\nAlways notably courteous in his treatment of opponents, Van Buren showed no\nbitterness toward either Adams or [Henry Clay](/wiki/Henry_Clay \"Henry Clay\"),\nand he voted for Clay's confirmation as [Secretary of\nState](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United States Secretary of\nState\"), notwithstanding Jackson's \"[corrupt bargain](/wiki/Corrupt_bargain\n\"Corrupt bargain\")\" charge.[62][63] At the same time, he opposed the Adams-\nClay plans for internal infrastructure improvements (roads, canals, bridges,\netc.) and declined to support U.S. participation in the [Congress of\nPanama](/wiki/Congress_of_Panama \"Congress of Panama\").[64] As chair of the\nJudiciary Committee, he brought forward a number of measures for the\nimprovement of judicial procedure, including one (not adopted), which would\nhave required a super-majority vote by the [United States Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court \"United States Supreme Court\") to\ndeclare a law unconstitutional.[65] In May 1826, Van Buren joined with Senator\n[Thomas Hart Benton](/wiki/Thomas_Hart_Benton_\\(senator\\) \"Thomas Hart Benton\n\\(senator\\)\") in reporting on patronage in the executive branch, going against\nhis own use of the spoils system to propose, in vain, that Presidents not be\nable to remove officeholders at will, and that Presidents report to Congress\non the reason for dismissal of federal position holders.[66] The 1828 \"[Tariff\nof Abominations](/wiki/Tariff_of_1828 \"Tariff of 1828\")\" was recognized as his\nwork. Since Democrats, especially Southerners, were generally opposed to\ntariffs that increased the price of manufactured goods from the North but did\nnot benefit the raw materials produced in the South, Van Buren could normally\nhave been expected to oppose tariffs. Political observers of the time viewed\nVan Buren's efforts to pass the 1828 tariff as part of the campaign to elect\nJackson as President. Anticipating that most Southerners would vote for Andrew\nJackson no matter who else was running, Van Buren intended the tariff proposed\nby Jackson's Northern Democratic supporters in Congress to attract to\nJackson's candidacy Northern voters, who generally favored high tariffs to\nprotect the manufactured goods they produced. Van Buren voted in favor, later\nadopting the cover story that he had done so only in response to instructions\nfrom the [New York State Legislature](/wiki/New_York_State_Legislature \"New\nYork State Legislature\"). Most Democrats, especially Southerners, continued to\noppose tariffs after 1828. Van Buren's political opponents in the Democratic\nParty used his 1828 vote against him for years afterwards to prevent him from\nobtaining Southern support for his candidacies.[67][68][69]\n\nVan Buren was not an exceptional orator like Henry Clay or [Daniel\nWebster](/wiki/Daniel_Webster \"Daniel Webster\"), but his more important\nspeeches show careful preparation and his opinions carried weight; the oft-\nrepeated charge that he refrained from declaring himself on crucial questions\nis hardly borne out by scrutiny of his senatorial career. In [February\n1827](/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_New_York,_1827 \"United States\nSenate election in New York, 1827\"), he was re-elected to the Senate by a\nlarge majority. He became one of the recognized managers of the Jackson\ncampaign, and his tour of [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\"), [the\nCarolinas](/wiki/The_Carolinas \"The Carolinas\"), and\n[Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._state\\) \"Georgia \\(U.S. state\\)\") in the spring\nof 1827 won support for Jackson from Crawford as Van Buren sought to\nreorganize and unify \"the old Republican party\" behind Jackson.[70] At the\nstate level, Jackson's committee chairs would split up the responsibilities\naround the state and organize volunteers at the local level. \"Hurra Boys\"\nwould plant hickory trees (in honor of Jackson's nickname, \"Old Hickory\") or\nhand out hickory sticks at rallies. In 1828 Van Buren ran for [Governor of New\nYork](/wiki/Governor_of_New_York \"Governor of New York\") in an effort to use\nhis personal popularity to bolster Jackson's chances of carrying New York in\nthe presidential election. Jackson defeated Adams handily, leading the pro-\nAdams _New York American_ to editorialize \"Organization is the secret of\nvictory. By the want of it we have been overthrown.\"[71] Van Buren won his\nelection, and resigned from the Senate to start the gubernatorial term, which\nbegan on January 1, 1829.[72]\n\nVan Buren's tenure as New York governor is the second shortest on record.\nWhile his term was short, he did manage to pass the Bank Safety Fund Law (an\nearly form of deposit insurance) through the Legislature.[73]\n\n## Secretary of\nState[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Secretary of State\")]\n\nOn March 5, 1829, President Jackson appointed Van Buren [Secretary of\nState](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United States Secretary of\nState\"), an office which probably had been promised him before the 1828\nelections, and Van Buren resigned the governorship on March 12.[74] He was\nsucceeded by his Lieutenant Governor, [Enos T. Throop](/wiki/Enos_T._Throop\n\"Enos T. Throop\"), a member of the Regency.\n\nAs Secretary of State, Van Buren sought congeniality with the [Kitchen\nCabinet](/wiki/Kitchen_Cabinet \"Kitchen Cabinet\"), Jackson's informal\nadvisers. He sometimes opposed Jackson in the matter of removing political\nappointees from office to replace them with Jackson loyalists, but also saw to\nthe replacement of postmasters in New York with Van Buren loyalists.[75] In\nJuly 1829, [Rutgers College](/wiki/Rutgers_University \"Rutgers University\")\nawarded Van Buren the [honorary degree](/wiki/Honorary_degree \"Honorary\ndegree\") of [LL.D.](/wiki/Legum_Doctor \"Legum Doctor\")[76]\n\nNo serious diplomatic crises arose during Van Buren's tenure, but he achieved\nseveral notable successes, such as settling long-standing claims against\nFrance and winning reparations for property that had been seized during the\n[Napoleonic Wars](/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars \"Napoleonic Wars\"). He reached an\nagreement with the British to open trade with the [British West\nIndies](/wiki/British_West_Indies \"British West Indies\") colonies and\nconcluded a treaty with the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman\nEmpire\") that gained American merchants access to the [Black\nSea](/wiki/Black_Sea \"Black Sea\"). Items on which he did not achieve success\nincluded settling the [Maine](/wiki/Maine \"Maine\")-[New\nBrunswick](/wiki/New_Brunswick \"New Brunswick\") boundary dispute with Great\nBritain, gaining settlement of the U.S. claim to the [Oregon\nCountry](/wiki/Oregon_Country \"Oregon Country\"), concluding a commercial\ntreaty with [Russia](/wiki/Russia \"Russia\"), and persuading\n[Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\") to sell [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\").[77][78]\n\nVan Buren also advised Jackson informally on matters of domestic policy—in the\ncontroversy over the [Bank of the United\nStates](/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States \"Second Bank of the United\nStates\"), he sided with Jackson. He also allied with Jackson on the [Indian\nRemoval Act](/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act \"Indian Removal Act\").[78][79] After the\nbreach between Jackson and Calhoun, which culminated with the [Nullification\nCrisis](/wiki/Nullification_Crisis \"Nullification Crisis\"), Van Buren's\nposition as one of Jackson's primary political supporters and policy advisors\nclearly branded him as the most prominent candidate for the vice presidency in\n1832, and Jackson's most likely successor in 1836.[80]\n\n### Petticoat\naffair[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Petticoat affair\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Floride_Calhoun_nee_Colhoun.jpg)](/wiki/File:Floride_Calhoun_nee_Colhoun.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Floride_Calhoun_nee_Colhoun.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMrs Floride Calhoun, a leader of the \"petticoats\"\n\nFurther information: [Petticoat affair](/wiki/Petticoat_affair \"Petticoat\naffair\")\n\nIn Jackson's first term, Van Buren won the president's lasting regard by his\ncourtesies to [Peggy Eaton](/wiki/Peggy_Eaton \"Peggy Eaton\"), wife of\n[Secretary of War](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War \"United States\nSecretary of War\") [John H. Eaton](/wiki/John_H._Eaton \"John H. Eaton\"), whom\nthe wives of the cabinet members and others had shunned over the circumstances\nsurrounding their marriage and her alleged moral failures as a cabinet\nwife.[81][82] Led by [Floride Calhoun](/wiki/Floride_Calhoun \"Floride\nCalhoun\"), wife of Vice President Calhoun, these women (the \"petticoats\")\nsocially ostracized the Eatons, refused to pay courtesy calls at their home or\nreceive them as visitors, and denied them invitations to social events.[83]\n\nBecause Calhoun was the most visible opponent of the Jackson administration,\nJackson felt that Calhoun and other anti-Jackson officials were fanning the\nflames of the Peggy Eaton controversy to gain political leverage.[84] As a\nwidower, Van Buren was unaffected by the position of the Cabinet wives, and he\nsupported Jackson's position that criticism of the Eatons would not be\ntolerated. By siding with Jackson, Van Buren helped create a counter-coalition\nthat weakened Calhoun.[85]\n\nThe dispute was resolved when Van Buren offered to resign; in April 1831,\nJackson accepted, and took the opportunity to reorganize his cabinet by asking\nfor the resignations of Cabinet members whose wives were part of the anti-\nEaton coalition.[86] Postmaster General [William T.\nBarry](/wiki/William_T._Barry \"William T. Barry\"), who had sided with Jackson\nand Van Buren, was the lone cabinet member to stay,[87] and Eaton eventually\nreceived appointments that took him away from Washington, first as [governor\nof Florida Territory](/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Florida \"List of Governors of\nFlorida\"), and then as [minister to\nSpain](/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Spain \"United States Ambassador to\nSpain\").[88]\n\n## Vice-\nPresidency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Vice-Presidency\")]\n\nAfter resigning as Secretary of State, Van Buren remained in office until June\n1831, and continued to play a part in Jackson's [Kitchen\nCabinet](/wiki/Kitchen_Cabinet \"Kitchen Cabinet\").[89] In August 1831 Jackson\ngave Van Buren a [recess appointment](/wiki/Recess_appointment \"Recess\nappointment\") as [Minister to the Court of St. James\n(Britain)](/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Kingdom \"United States\nAmbassador to the United Kingdom\") and he arrived in London in September.[90]\nHe was cordially received, but in February he learned his nomination was\nrejected by the Senate on January 25, 1832.[91] The rejection was attributed\nto Van Buren's instructions while Secretary of State to [Louis\nMcLane](/wiki/Louis_McLane \"Louis McLane\"), the American minister to Britain,\nwhich concerned the opening of the West Indies trade, and repudiated the\nforeign policy of Jackson's predecessors, which the Senate claimed was a\nbreach of decorum.[92] The rejection of Van Buren was essentially the work of\nCalhoun, who had opposed Van Buren's confirmation, believing that Van Buren\nhad attempted to keep him from becoming vice president by making overtures to\n[Henry Clay](/wiki/Henry_Clay \"Henry Clay\") to run on a ticket with William H.\nCrawford, Van Buren's preferred candidate for president in 1824.[93] Calhoun\nalso opposed Van Buren for his role in the Petticoat Affair and his work on\nthe 1828 tariff. When the vote on Van Buren's nomination was taken, enough\npro-Calhoun Democrats refrained from voting to produce a tie, thus giving\nCalhoun, in his role as presiding officer, the ability to cast a vote. He\nvoted against Van Buren, and so achieved \"vengeance\" on Van Buren.[94] Calhoun\nwas elated, convinced that he had ended Van Buren's career. \"It will kill him\ndead, sir, kill him dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick,\" Calhoun\nexclaimed to a friend within earshot of Missouri Senator [Thomas Hart\nBenton](/wiki/Thomas_Hart_Benton_\\(senator\\) \"Thomas Hart Benton\n\\(senator\\)\").[95]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Francis_Alexander_-\n_Martin_Van_Buren_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Francis_Alexander_-\n_Martin_Van_Buren_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)](/wiki/File:Francis_Alexander_-\n_Martin_Van_Buren_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Francis_Alexander_-_Martin_Van_Buren_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nA painting of Van Buren by [Francis Alexander](/wiki/Francis_Alexander\n\"Francis Alexander\"), c. 1830–1840\n\nBenton recognized the significance of Calhoun's action, saying \"You have\nbroken a minister and made a vice president.\"[96] [John\nTyler](/wiki/John_Tyler \"John Tyler\"), then serving as a Senator from\n[Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\"), also recognized Calhoun's overreach,\nwriting to a friend that \"Van Buren is elevated by the silly thing of\nrejecting him.\"[97] As Benton and Tyler foresaw, Calhoun's move backfired, by\nmaking Van Buren appear the victim of petty politics, thus raising him in both\nJackson's regard and the esteem of others in the Democratic Party. Far from\nending Van Buren's career, Calhoun's action gave greater impetus to Van\nBuren's candidacy for vice president.[98]\n\nAfter a brief tour of Europe, Van Buren reached New York on July 5, 1832. The\nMay [1832 Democratic National\nConvention](/wiki/1832_Democratic_National_Convention \"1832 Democratic\nNational Convention\"), the party's first, had nominated him for vice president\non the Jackson ticket.[99] Van Buren's nomination was not as strongly\nsupported as Jackson's, particularly among southerners who recalled his work\non the tariff in 1828, but he somewhat placated southerners by denying the\nright of Congress to abolish slavery in the [District of\nColumbia](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\") without the consent of\nthe slave states.[100]\n\nThe Jackson-Van Buren ticket won the [election of\n1832](/wiki/U.S._presidential_election,_1832 \"U.S. presidential election,\n1832\") by a landslide,[101] and Van Buren took office as Vice President in\nMarch 1833.[102] During his time in office Van Buren continued to be one of\nJackson's primary advisors and confidants, and accompanied Jackson on his tour\nof the northeastern United States in 1833.[103] Jackson's confidence in Van\nBuren was further demonstrated after Jackson named [Benjamin F.\nButler](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_Butler_\\(lawyer\\) \"Benjamin Franklin Butler\n\\(lawyer\\)\"), Van Buren's political ally and former law partner, to serve as\n[Attorney General](/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General \"United States\nAttorney General\"),[104] and [John Forsyth](/wiki/John_Forsyth_\\(Georgia\\)\n\"John Forsyth \\(Georgia\\)\"), another Van Buren ally, to serve as Secretary of\nState.[105][106]\n\nVan Buren's support of Jackson in the Nullification Crisis and the decision\nnot to recharter the Second Bank of the United States made him a target of\nJackson's most vocal opponents. Van Buren was threatened with violence,\nincluding explicit comments from Senator [George\nPoindexter](/wiki/George_Poindexter \"George Poindexter\") of Mississippi, which\nprompted Van Buren to carry pistols for self-defense.[107] However he also\ndemonstrated both the willingness and the ability to work with his opponents,\ncooperating with Clay and Calhoun (now a Senator) to pass the compromise\n[Tariff of 1833](/wiki/Tariff_of_1833 \"Tariff of 1833\"), which helped end the\nNullification Crisis.[108][_[self-published\nsource](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\nDuring one contentious debate on the bank issue, Van Buren presided over the\nSenate as Clay spoke passionately about the harm he believed Jackson's bank\npolicy would cause. Directing his remarks to Van Buren, Clay asked\nrhetorically whether Van Buren would approach Jackson and persuade him to\nchange his mind. After Clay concluded, observers wondered how Van Buren would\nreact. Van Buren's response was to descend from the rostrum and ask Clay if he\ncould borrow a pinch of [snuff](/wiki/Snuff_\\(tobacco\\) \"Snuff \\(tobacco\\)\").\nCaught off guard, Clay reflexively handed over his [snuff box](/wiki/Snuff_box\n\"Snuff box\"). Van Buren took a pinch, bowed to Clay, and left the chamber,\nboth deflating the effect of Clay's remarks and preventing tension from\nescalating, as would have happened if Van Buren had attempted to reply\ndirectly.[109]\n\n## Presidential election of\n1836[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Presidential election of 1836\")]\n\nMain article: [United States presidential election,\n1836](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1836 \"United States\npresidential election, 1836\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/ElectoralCollege1836.svg/220px-\nElectoralCollege1836.svg.png)](/wiki/File:ElectoralCollege1836.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ElectoralCollege1836.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1836 electoral vote results\n\nJackson, not running in 1836, was determined to make Van Buren his successor\nin order to continue the Jackson administration's policies.[110] This\nconclusion on Jackson's part soon became public.

Jackson,\non the other hand, strongly preferred Johnson. Again, Jackson's considerable\ninfluence prevailed, however, Johnson received the required two-thirds vote\nonly after New York Senator [Silas Wright](/wiki/Silas_Wright \"Silas Wright\")\nprevailed upon non-delegate Edward Rucker to cast the 15 votes of the absent\nTennessee delegation in his favor.[112][111]\n\nOn the issue of slavery, Van Buren moved to obtain the support of southerners\nby assuring them that he opposed abolitionism and supported the maintaining of\nslavery in states where it had already existed.[113] Regarding the national\nbank, Van Buren made clear that he opposed rechartering a [national\nbank](/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States \"Second Bank of the United\nStates\").[114] To demonstrate [consistency](/wiki/Good_faith \"Good faith\")\nregarding his opinions on slavery, Van Buren cast the tie-breaking Senate vote\nin favor of [engrossing](/wiki/Enrolled_bill \"Enrolled bill\") a bill to\nsubject [abolitionist](/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States \"Abolitionism\nin the United States\") mail to state laws, thus ensuring that its circulation\nwould be prohibited in the South.[115]\n\nMartin Van Buren's competitors in the [election of\n1836](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1836 \"United States\npresidential election, 1836\") were three members of the newly established\n[Whig Party](/wiki/Whig_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Whig Party \\(United\nStates\\)\"). Still a loose [coalition](/wiki/Coalition \"Coalition\") bound by\nmutual opposition to Jackson's anti-bank policies but lacking the party unity\nor organizational strength to field a single ticket or define a coherent\nplatform,[112] the Whigs ran several regional candidates in hopes of sending\nthe election to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation\nwould have one vote and the Whigs would stand a better chance of winning.[116]\nThey were: [Hugh White](/wiki/Hugh_Lawson_White \"Hugh Lawson White\") of\nTennessee, [Daniel Webster](/wiki/Daniel_Webster \"Daniel Webster\") of\nMassachusetts, and [William Henry Harrison](/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison\n\"William Henry Harrison\") of Indiana. Besides endorsing internal improvements\nand a national bank, the Whigs tried to tie Democrats to abolitionism and\nsectional tension, and attacked Jackson for \"acts of aggression and usurpation\nof power.\"[117]\n\nThe Whigs nominated New York [Anti-Mason](/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party \"Anti-\nMasonic Party\") [Francis Granger](/wiki/Francis_Granger \"Francis Granger\") and\nformer Democrat [John Tyler](/wiki/John_Tyler \"John Tyler\") of Virginia for\nvice president.[112] Richard Johnson, Van Buren's running mate, was a hero of\nthe [War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\"), and claimed to have killed\n[Tecumseh](/wiki/Tecumseh \"Tecumseh\") at the [Battle of the\nThames](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Thames \"Battle of the Thames\"). Since Harrison was\ncampaigning for president as the \"hero of\n[Tippecanoe](/wiki/Battle_of_Tippecanoe \"Battle of Tippecanoe\"),\" Johnson's\nfriends countered with:\n\n> Rumpsey, dumpsey, rumpsey dumpsey,  \n>  Colonel Johnson killed Tecumseh![118]\n\nVan Buren won the election with 764,198 popular votes, only 50.9 percent of\nthe total, and 170 [electoral votes](/wiki/Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Electoral College \\(United States\\)\"). Harrison led the Whigs with 73\nelectoral votes, White receiving 26 and Webster 14. Willie P. Mangum of South\nCarolina received his state’s 11 electoral votes.[117] Van Buren's victory\nresulted from a combination of his own attractive political and personal\nqualities, Jackson's popularity and endorsement, the organizational power of\nthe Democratic party, and the inability of the Whig Party—at this point—to\nmuster an effective candidate and campaign.[119] Johnson, however, received\nonly 147 electoral votes, 70 more than his closest contender, Francis Granger,\nbut one less than the number required to elect. Virginia's electors had\nremained loyal to Van Buren, who carried the state by a close margin,[112] but\ninstead, they all [refused to vote for](/wiki/Faithless_elector \"Faithless\nelector\") Johnson.[120]\n\nVan Buren was the first president to be born after the [United States\nDeclaration of Independence](/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence\n\"United States Declaration of Independence\") from the [Kingdom of Great\nBritain](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great Britain\").\n\nOn February 8, 1837, the U.S. Senate convened, and in accordance with the\n[Twelfth Amendment](/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") chose the vice\npresident from the two top electoral vote recipients, Johnson, and Granger.\nJohnson won the contingent vote, 33-17, and became the nation's ninth vice\npresident.[121]\n\n## Presidency\n1837–1841[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Presidency 1837–1841\")]\n\n[![BEP engraved portrait of Van Buren as\nPresident](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/VAN_BUREN%2C_Martin-\nPresident_%28BEP_engraved_portrait%29.jpg/350px-VAN_BUREN%2C_Martin-\nPresident_%28BEP_engraved_portrait%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:VAN_BUREN,_Martin-\nPresident_\\(BEP_engraved_portrait\\).jpg)\n\n[File:VAN BUREN, Martin-President (BEP engraved\nportrait).jpg](/wiki/File:VAN_BUREN,_Martin-\nPresident_\\(BEP_engraved_portrait\\).jpg \"File:VAN BUREN, Martin-President\n\\(BEP engraved portrait\\).jpg\")\n\n[BEP](/wiki/Bureau_of_Engraving_and_Printing \"Bureau of Engraving and\nPrinting\") engraved portrait of Van Buren as President\n\nMain article: [Presidency of Martin Van\nBuren](/wiki/Presidency_of_Martin_Van_Buren \"Presidency of Martin Van Buren\")\n\n### White House\nhostess[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: White House hostess\")]\n\nFor the first half of his presidency, Van Buren, who had been a widower for\nmany years, did not have a specific person fill the role of White House\nhostess at administration social events, but tried to assume such duties\nhimself. When his eldest son [Abraham Van Buren](/wiki/Abraham_Van_Buren\n\"Abraham Van Buren\") married [Angelica\nSingleton](/wiki/Angelica_Singleton_Van_Buren \"Angelica Singleton Van Buren\")\nin 1838, he quickly acted to install his daughter-in-law as his hostess. She\nsolicited the advice of her distant relative, [Dolley\nMadison](/wiki/Dolley_Madison \"Dolley Madison\"),[122] who had moved back to\nWashington after her [husband's](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\")\ndeath,[123] and soon the president's parties livened up. After the 1839 New\nYear's Eve reception, the _Boston Post_ raved: \"[Angelica Van Buren is a] lady\nof rare accomplishments, very modest yet perfectly easy and graceful in her\nmanners and free and vivacious in her conversation ... universally\nadmired.\"[122]\n\nAs the nation endured a deep [economic depression](/wiki/Economic_depression\n\"Economic depression\"), Angelica van Buren's receiving style at receptions was\ninfluenced by her heavy reading on European court life (and her naive delight\nin being received as the _Queen of the United States_ when she visited the\nroyal courts of England and France after her marriage). Newspaper coverage of\nthis, in addition to the claim that she intended to re-landscape the [White\nHouse grounds](/wiki/South_Lawn_\\(White_House\\) \"South Lawn \\(White House\\)\")\nto resemble the royal gardens of Europe, was used in a political attack on her\nfather-in-law by a Pennsylvania Whig Congressman [Charles\nOgle](/wiki/Charles_Ogle_\\(politician\\) \"Charles Ogle \\(politician\\)\"). He\nreferred obliquely to her as part of the presidential \"household\" in his\nfamous [Gold Spoon Oration](/wiki/Gold_Spoon_Oration \"Gold Spoon Oration\").\nThe attack was delivered in Congress and the depiction of the President as\nliving a royal lifestyle was a primary factor in his defeat for re-\nelection.[124]\n\n### Panic of\n1837[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Panic of 1837\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Jackson_and_Van_Buren%2C_1837.jpg/220px-\nJackson_and_Van_Buren%2C_1837.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jackson_and_Van_Buren,_1837.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jackson_and_Van_Buren,_1837.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_**The modern balaam and his ass**_ , an 1837 caricature placing the blame for\nthe Panic of 1837 and the perilous state of the banking system on outgoing\nPresident Andrew Jackson, shown riding a donkey, while President Martin Van\nBuren comments approvingly.\n\nWhen Van Buren entered office, the nation's economic health had taken a turn\nfor the worse and the prosperity of the early 1830s was over. Two months into\nhis presidency, on May 10, 1837, some important state banks in New York,\nrunning out of hard currency reserves, refused to convert paper money into\ngold or silver, and other financial institutions throughout the nation quickly\nfollowed suit. This [financial crisis](/wiki/Financial_crisis \"Financial\ncrisis\") would become known as the [Panic of 1837](/wiki/Panic_of_1837 \"Panic\nof 1837\").[125] The Panic was followed by a five-year\n[depression](/wiki/Depression_\\(economics\\) \"Depression \\(economics\\)\") in\nwhich banks failed and [unemployment](/wiki/Unemployment \"Unemployment\")\nreached record highs.[126]\n\nVan Buren blamed the economic collapse on greedy American and foreign business\nand financial institutions, as well as the over-extension of credit by U.S.\nbanks. Whig leaders in Congress blamed the Democrats, along with Andrew\nJackson's economic policies,[125] specifically his 1836 [Specie\nCircular](/wiki/Specie_Circular \"Specie Circular\"). Cries of \"rescind the\ncircular!\" went up and former President Jackson sent word to Van Buren asking\nhim not to rescind the order, believing that it had to be given enough time to\nwork. Others, like [Nicholas Biddle](/wiki/Nicholas_Biddle_\\(banker\\)\n\"Nicholas Biddle \\(banker\\)\"), believed that Jackson's [dismantling of the\nBank of the United States](/wiki/Bank_War#Jackson's_dismantling_of_the_BUS\n\"Bank War\") was directly responsible for the irresponsible creation of paper\nmoney by the state banks which had precipitated this panic.[127]\n\nTo deal with the crisis, the Whigs proposed rechartering the [national\nbank](/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States \"History of\ncentral banking in the United States\"). The president countered by proposing\nthe establishment of an [independent U.S. treasury](/wiki/Independent_Treasury\n\"Independent Treasury\"), which would take the politics out of the nation's\nmoney supply; the government would hold all of its money balances in the form\nof [gold or silver](/wiki/Hard_money_\\(policy\\) \"Hard money \\(policy\\)\") and\nwould be restricted from printing [paper money](/wiki/Banknote \"Banknote\") at\nwill, a measure designed to prevent [inflation](/wiki/Inflation\n\"Inflation\").[128] Van Buren announced his proposal in September 1837;[125]\nbut that was too much for state banking interests, and an alliance of\nconservative Democrats and Whigs prevented it from becoming law until\n1840.[129] The independent treasury lasted only one year—the Whigs, who won a\ncongressional majority and the presidency in the 1840 elections, promptly\nrepealed the law.[130]\n\nBy the time Congress finally acted, the nation's economy had been mired in a\ndepression for nearly four years; the problems would continue into the early\n1840s. More important for Van Buren's immediate future, the depression would\nbe a major issue in his upcoming re-election campaign.[125]\n\n### Indian\nremovals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Indian removals\")]\n\nIn 1838, Van Buren directed General [Winfield Scott](/wiki/Winfield_Scott\n\"Winfield Scott\") to forcibly institute the [removal](/wiki/Indian_removal\n\"Indian removal\") of all those [Cherokee](/wiki/Cherokee \"Cherokee\") who had\nnot complied with the 1835 [Treaty of New Echota](/wiki/Treaty_of_New_Echota\n\"Treaty of New Echota\")—by departing from the [Southeastern United\nStates](/wiki/Southeastern_United_States \"Southeastern United States\") and\nmoving west (to present day [Oklahoma](/wiki/Oklahoma \"Oklahoma\")).[131] The\nCherokee were herded violently into internment camps, where they were kept for\nthe summer of 1838. The actual transportation west was delayed by intense heat\nand drought, but in the fall, the Cherokee reluctantly agreed to transport\nthemselves west.[132][133] During the Cherokee removal, part of the [Trail of\nTears](/wiki/Trail_of_Tears \"Trail of Tears\"), some 20,000 people were\ninvoluntarily relocated.[7]\n\nIn the course of Van Buren's presidency the federal government negotiated 19\ntreaties with [Indian nations](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States\n\"Native Americans in the United States\"). The administration also contended\nwith the Seminole in Florida, who engaged the\n[army](/wiki/Regular_Army_\\(United_States\\) \"Regular Army \\(United States\\)\")\nin a seven-year battle.[134] Known as the [Second Seminole\nWar](/wiki/Second_Seminole_War \"Second Seminole War\"), the battle began in\n1835 during Jackson's presidency. Fighting was not resolved until 1842, after\nVan Buren had left office.[135] It is regarded as the longest and most costly\nof the nation's [Indian conflicts](/wiki/American_Indian_Wars \"American Indian\nWars\").[136][137]\n\n### Mormons[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Mormons\")]\n\nIn 1839, [Joseph Smith, Jr.](/wiki/Joseph_Smith \"Joseph Smith\"), the founder\nof the [Latter Day Saint movement](/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint_movement \"Latter Day\nSaint movement\"), visited Van Buren to plead for the U.S. to help roughly\n20,000 Mormon settlers of [Independence,\nMissouri](/wiki/Independence,_Missouri \"Independence, Missouri\") (who were\nforced from the state during the [1838 Mormon War](/wiki/Mormon_War_\\(1838\\)\n\"Mormon War \\(1838\\)\").) The Governor of Missouri, [Lilburn\nBoggs](/wiki/Lilburn_Boggs \"Lilburn Boggs\"), had issued [an executive\norder](/wiki/Missouri_Executive_Order_44 \"Missouri Executive Order 44\") on\nOctober 27, 1838, known as the \"Extermination Order\". It authorized troops to\nuse force against Mormons to \"exterminate or drive [them] from the\nstate\".[138][139] In 1839, after moving to Illinois, Smith and his party\nappealed to members of Congress and to President Van Buren to intercede for\nthe Mormons. According to Smith's grandnephew, Van Buren said to Smith, \"Your\ncause is just, but I can do nothing for you; if I take up for you I shall lose\nthe vote of Missouri\".[140][141]\n\n### Texas[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Texas\")]\n\nIn a bold step, Van Buren reversed Andrew Jackson's policies and sought peace\nat home, as well as abroad. Instead of settling a financial dispute between\nAmerican citizens and the Mexican government by force, Van Buren wanted to\nseek a diplomatic solution. In an action that upset political leaders of the\npro-slavery states, in August 1837, Van Buren denied [Texas](/wiki/Texas\n\"Texas\")' formal request to join the United States, partly to prevent the\nupset of the slave state/free state balance in the [Missouri\nCompromise](/wiki/Missouri_Compromise \"Missouri Compromise\"), and partly\nbecause he hoped to avoid a possible war with Mexico over Texas\nannexation.[142][143]\n\n### British North\nAmerica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: British North America\")]\n\nBritish subjects in [Lower Canada](/wiki/Lower_Canada \"Lower Canada\") (now\nQuebec) and [Upper Canada](/wiki/Upper_Canada \"Upper Canada\") (now Ontario)\nrose in [rebellion](/wiki/Rebellion \"Rebellion\") in\n[1837](/wiki/Lower_Canada_Rebellion \"Lower Canada Rebellion\") and\n[1838](/wiki/Upper_Canada_Rebellion \"Upper Canada Rebellion\") respectively,\nprotesting their lack of [responsible government](/wiki/Responsible_government\n\"Responsible government\").

Several hundred volunteers procured the steamboat\n_[Caroline](/wiki/Caroline_affair \"Caroline affair\")_ to deliver supplies and\narms to Navy Island from [Fort Schlosser](/wiki/Fort_Schlosser \"Fort\nSchlosser\").[144] To deter an imminent invasion, British forces crossed to the\nAmerican bank of the river, where they burned and sank the ship. When an\nAmerican was killed and others wounded,[145] considerable sentiment arose\nwithin the United States to declare war, and a British ship was burned in\nrevenge.[146] Soon afterward, Mackenzie’s \"republic\" collapsed, and the rebels\nwithdrew into the U.S.; the initial uprising in Lower Canada by then collapsed\nas well.\n\nVan Buren, looking to avoid a war with Great Britain, sent General Winfield\nScott to the [border](/wiki/Canada%E2%80%93United_States_border \"Canada–United\nStates border\") with broad discretionary powers for its protection and its\npeace.[147] Scott impressed upon American citizens the need for a peaceful\nresolution to the crisis, and made it clear that the U.S. government would not\nsupport adventuresome Americans attacking the British. Also, in early January\n1838, the president proclaimed U.S. neutrality with regard to the Canadian\nindependence issue, a declaration which Congress endorsed by passing a\nneutrality law discouraging the participation of American citizens in foreign\nconflicts.[146]\n\nSimultaneously Charles Duncombe and Robert Nelson helped foment a largely\nAmerican militia, the [Hunters' Lodge](/wiki/Hunters%27_Lodges \"Hunters'\nLodges\")/[Frères chasseurs](/wiki/Fr%C3%A8res_chasseurs \"Frères chasseurs\"),\nwhich carried out several attacks in Upper Canada between December 1837 and\nDecember 1838, collectively known as the [Patriot War](/wiki/Patriot_War\n\"Patriot War\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The administration followed through on its\nenforcement of the Neutrality Act, encouraged the prosecution of filibusters,\nand actively deterred U.S. citizens from subversive activities abroad. In the\nlong term, the Patriot War contributed to the construction of healthy\n[Anglo–American](/wiki/Special_relationship \"Special relationship\") and\n[U.S.–Canadian](/wiki/Canada%E2%80%93United_States_relations \"Canada–United\nStates relations\") relationships in the 20th century; it also led, more\nimmediately, to a backlash among citizens against the overreach of federal\nauthority,[148] which hurt congressional Democrats in the 1838 midterm\nelections.\n\nAnother crisis surfaced in late 1838, in the disputed territory on the\n[Maine](/wiki/Maine \"Maine\")–[New Brunswick](/wiki/New_Brunswick \"New\nBrunswick\") frontier, where Americans were settling on disputed land claimed\nby the United States and Great Britain. Both American and New Brunswick\n[lumberjacks](/wiki/Lumberjack \"Lumberjack\") cut timber in the disputed\nterritory during the winter of 1838–39. On December 29, New Brunswick\nlumbermen were spotted cutting down trees on an American’s estate near the\n[Aroostook River](/wiki/Aroostook_River \"Aroostook River\").[146] American\nwoodcutters rushed to stand guard. A shouting match, known as the [Battle of\nCaribou](/wiki/Battle_of_Caribou \"Battle of Caribou\"), ensued.\n\nTensions quickly boiled over into a near war with both Maine and New Brunswick\narresting each other's citizens. The crisis seemed ready to turn into an armed\nconflict.[149] British troops began to gather on the [Saint John\nRiver](/wiki/St._John_River_\\(Bay_of_Fundy\\) \"St. John River \\(Bay of\nFundy\\)\"). The American press clamored for war; “Maine and her soil, or\nBLOOD!” screamed one editorial. “Let the sword be drawn and the scabbard\nthrown away!” Congress authorized 50,000 troops and a $10 million budget.[150]\n\nTo settle the crisis, Van Buren met with the British minister to the United\nStates. They agreed to resolve the border issue diplomatically. Van Buren also\nsent General Scott to the northern border area to show military resolve and\nmore importantly to lower the tensions. Scott successfully convinced all sides\nto submit the border issue to arbitration. The dispute was put to rest a few\nyears later, with the signing of the 1842 [Webster–Ashburton\nTreaty](/wiki/Webster%E2%80%93Ashburton_Treaty \"Webster–Ashburton\nTreaty\").[146]\n\n### _United States v. The\nAmistad_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: United States v. The Amistad\")]\n\nThe _[Amistad](/wiki/United_States_v._The_Amistad \"United States v. The\nAmistad\")_ case was a [freedom suit](/wiki/Freedom_suit \"Freedom suit\") that\ninvolved international issues and parties, as well as United States law,\nresulting from the rebellion of Africans on board the Spanish\n[schooner](/wiki/Schooner \"Schooner\") _[La Amistad](/wiki/La_Amistad \"La\nAmistad\")_ in 1839,.[151] The Van Buren administration supported the [Spanish\ngovernment's](/wiki/Government_of_Spain \"Government of Spain\") demand that the\nship and its cargo (including the Africans) be turned over to them.[152] When\na Federal District Court judge ruled that the Africans were legally free and\nshould be transported home, the administration appealed the case to the\nSupreme Court.\n\nIn February 1840, former President (and sitting U.S. Representative from\nMassachusetts) [John Quincy Adams](/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John Quincy\nAdams\") argued passionately for the Africans' right to freedom. Attorney\nGeneral [Henry D. Gilpin](/wiki/Henry_D._Gilpin \"Henry D. Gilpin\") presented\nthe government’s case. In March 1841, the Supreme Court issued its final\nverdict: the _Amistad_ Africans were free people and should be allowed to\nreturn home.[153] The unique nature of the case, people of color testifying in\nfederal court, and being represented by prominent lawyers, heightened public\ninterest in the saga, as did the participation of former president Adams. The\nAmistad case drew attention to the personal tragedies of slavery and attracted\nnew support for the growing abolition movement in the North. It also\ntransformed the courts into the principal forum for a national debate on the\nlegal foundations of slavery.[154]\n\n### Cabinet[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Cabinet\")]\n\n[![Engraved full-length portrait of a balding man standing next to a table\nwith his left arm resting on a book and in the background a stone balustrade\nbeyond which are trees and a building with columned\nportico](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/MVan_Buren-\nportrait.jpg/220px-MVan_Buren-portrait.jpg)](/wiki/File:MVan_Buren-\nportrait.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MVan_Buren-portrait.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPortrait of Martin Van Buren\n\nThe Van Buren Cabinet  \n---  \nOffice | Name | Term  \n[President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United States\") | Martin Van Buren | 1837–1841  \n[Vice President](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States \"Vice President of the United States\") | [Richard Mentor Johnson](/wiki/Richard_Mentor_Johnson \"Richard Mentor Johnson\") | 1837–1841  \n[Secretary of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State \"United States Secretary of State\") | [John Forsyth](/wiki/John_Forsyth_\\(politician\\) \"John Forsyth \\(politician\\)\") | 1837–1841  \n[Secretary of Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury \"United States Secretary of the Treasury\") | [Levi Woodbury](/wiki/Levi_Woodbury \"Levi Woodbury\") | 1837–1841  \n[Secretary of War](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War \"United States Secretary of War\") | [Joel R.

Also, while the Democratic Party retained a\nmajority in both chambers,[157][158] a split among House Democrats led to Whig\nCongressman [Robert M. T. Hunter](/wiki/Robert_M._T._Hunter \"Robert M.

Van Buren's presidency had been\nproblematic, with the U.S. economy mired in a severe downturn; also of concern\nwere several divisive issues—slavery, western expansion, and tensions with\nGreat Britain—that provided opportunities for Van Buren's political opponents,\nand even some fellow Democrats to criticize him.[119] Although Van Buren's\nrenomination was never in doubt, Democratic strategists began to question the\nwisdom of keeping Johnson on the ticket. Even former president Jackson\nconceded that Johnson was a liability and insisted on former House Speaker\n[James K. Polk](/wiki/James_K._Polk \"James K. Polk\") of Tennessee as Van\nBuren's new running mate. With William Henry Harrison, Johnson's former\ncommander and comrade-in-arms and the \"Hero of Tippecanoe,\" emerging as a\nlikely [Whig](/wiki/Whig_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Whig Party \\(United\nStates\\)\") presidential contender, Van Buren was reluctant to drop the\nDemocrats' own hero from the ticket.[112] The convention decided to allow\nstate Democratic Party leaders to select the vice-presidential candidates for\ntheir states.[162]\n\nThe Whigs did select Harrison as their nominee, and presented him to the\nnation as the antithesis of the president, whom they derided as ineffective,\ncorrupt, and effete.[119] Van Buren was blamed for the hard economic times,\nand ridiculed as \"Martin Van Ruin\".[163] Van Buren's rather elegant personal\nstyle was also an easy target for Whig attacks, such as the [Gold Spoon\nOration](/wiki/Gold_Spoon_Oration \"Gold Spoon Oration\").[164]\n\nVan Buren remained optimistic about his chances for reelection until October\n1840, by which time it became unlikely that he would defeat Harrison. An\nastonishing 80 percent of eligible voters went to the polls on election\nday.[119] Harrison won by a popular vote of 1,275,612 to 1,130,033, and an\nelectoral vote margin of 234 to 60.[117] Additionally, Whigs won majorities\nfor the first time in both the U.S. House and the Senate.[112]\n\nA [linguistic](/wiki/Linguistic \"Linguistic\") legacy of the 1840 campaign was\nattributed to Van Buren himself—the expression \"[OK](/wiki/OK \"OK\").\"[165]\nAlthough some language experts attribute OK to other proposed origins,\nincluding words from the [Choctaw](/wiki/Choctaw_language \"Choctaw language\")\nor [Wolof](/wiki/Wolof_language \"Wolof language\") languages,[165][166] and\nothers to an abbreviation of \"oll korrect,\" misspellings attributed to Andrew\nJackson, the prevailing opinion is that it derives from \"**O** ld **K**\ninderhook,\" one of the many nicknames for Van Buren.[165][167] The first\nrecorded use of \"OK\" in the sense of approval dates back to 1839 when a\nnewspaper referred to a Democratic meeting of \"the roarers, the butt-enders,\nringtails and OKs,\" adding, \"the allusion was probably to those who put their\nOK on the nomination of Van Buren.\"[165]\n\n## Election of\n1844[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit\nsection: Election of 1844\")]\n\nOn the expiration of his term, Van Buren returned to his estate,\n[Lindenwald](/wiki/Lindenwald \"Lindenwald\") in Kinderhook, where he planned\nhis return to the White House. He seemed likely to be nominated by the\nDemocrats in 1844, but in April of that year a Van Buren letter to [William H.\nHammett](/wiki/William_H._Hammett \"William H. Hammett\") was made public.[168]\nIn it, Van Buren opposed the immediate annexation of [Texas](/wiki/Texas\n\"Texas\"), but said that he would support annexation once the state of war\nbetween Texas and [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\") was resolved.[169] President\n[John Tyler](/wiki/John_Tyler \"John Tyler\") had pursued the annexation of\nTexas as his chief foreign policy goal, and many Democrats, particularly in\nthe South, were anxious to quickly complete the annexation of Texas.[170]\n\nVan Buren's opposition to immediate annexation cost him the support of pro-\nslavery Democrats; he began the [Democratic National\nConvention](/wiki/1844_Democratic_National_Convention \"1844 Democratic\nNational Convention\") with a majority of the delegates, but with no southern\nsupport he could not reach the two-thirds threshold required for\nnomination.[171] He won 146 of the 266 votes on the first presidential ballot,\nwith only 12 of his votes coming from Southern states.[170] Van Buren's name\nwas withdrawn after eight ballots, and a [dark horse](/wiki/Dark_horse \"Dark\nhorse\"), [James K. Polk](/wiki/James_K._Polk \"James K. Polk\"), received the\nnomination and went on to win the [1844 presidential\nelection](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1844 \"United States\npresidential election, 1844\").[172] After taking office, Polk used [George\nBancroft](/wiki/George_Bancroft \"George Bancroft\") as an intermediary to offer\nVan Buren the ambassadorship to London.[173] Van Buren declined, partly\nbecause he was upset with Polk over the treatment the Van Buren delegates had\nreceived at the 1844 convention, and partly because he was content in his\nretirement.[174]\n\n## Later\nlife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Martin_Van_Buren&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit\nsection: Later life\")]\n\n[![A three-quarters length painted portrait of a balding man with gray hair,\nstanding with his right hand grasping a bundle of papers lying on a\ntable](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Mvanburen.jpeg/170px-\nMvanburen.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Mvanburen.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mvanburen.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1858 portrait by [GPA Healy](/wiki/George_Peter_Alexander_Healy \"George Peter\nAlexander Healy\"), on display at the [White House](/wiki/White_House \"White\nHouse\")\n\nVan Buren had resisted the slightest interference with the institution of\nslavery in the states where it existed.[175] After leaving the White House,\nVan Buren grew increasingly opposed to slavery, and his earlier views about\nits constitutional standing gave way over time to acceptance of anti-slavery\npositions including opposing slavery's expansion into newly organized western\nstates.[176] In [1848](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1848 \"United\nStates presidential election, 1848\"), he was nominated for president by two\nminor parties, first by the \"[Barnburner](/wiki/Barnburner \"Barnburner\")\"\nfaction of the Democratic Party in New York, then by the [Free Soil\nParty](/wiki/Free_Soil_Party \"Free Soil Party\"), with whom the \"Barnburners\"\ncoalesced. The Barnburners and Free Soilers opposed Democratic nominee [Lewis\nCass](/wiki/Lewis_Cass \"Lewis Cass\"), who opposed the [Wilmot\nProviso](/wiki/Wilmot_Proviso \"Wilmot Proviso\") and was otherwise seen as\nfriendly to slavery.[177] In addition, Van Buren, who had been denied the 1844\nnomination in part due to the efforts of Cass supporters, may have run in\norder to exact a measure of revenge by denying Cass the presidency.[178] Van\nBuren won no electoral votes, but finished second to Whig nominee [Zachary\nTaylor](/wiki/Zachary_Taylor \"Zachary Taylor\") in New York, taking enough\nvotes from Cass to give the state—and perhaps the election—to Taylor.[179]\n\n[![Half-length photographic portrait of an elderly, balding man dressed in a\ndark coat, vest and\ncravat](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Martin_Van_Buren_daguerreotype-\nrestored.jpg/170px-Martin_Van_Buren_daguerreotype-\nrestored.jpg)](/wiki/File:Martin_Van_Buren_daguerreotype-restored.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Martin_Van_Buren_daguerreotype-restored.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Daguerreotype](/wiki/Daguerreotype \"Daguerreotype\") of Martin Van Buren,\ncirca 1855\n\nUnlike many anti-slavery Democrats of the 1840s and 1850s, who later joined\nthe [Republican Party](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican\nParty \\(United States\\)\"), Van Buren and most of his followers remained in the\nDemocratic fold. Those followers include his son [John Van\nBuren](/wiki/John_Van_Buren \"John Van Buren\") and [Samuel J.\nTilden](/wiki/Samuel_J._Tilden \"Samuel J.

Pierce asked Van Buren to use his role as\nthe senior living ex-President to issue a formal call. Van Buren's reply\nsuggested that Buchanan should be the one to call the meeting, since he was\nthe former President who had served most recently, or that Pierce should issue\nthe call himself if he strongly believed in the merit of his proposal. Neither\nBuchanan nor Pierce was willing to make Pierce's proposal public, and nothing\nmore resulted from it.[186]\n\nVan Buren's health began to fail later in 1861, and he was bedridden with\npneumonia during the fall and winter of 1861–62.[187] He did not recover, and\ndied of bronchial [asthma](/wiki/Asthma \"Asthma\") and [heart\nfailure](/wiki/Heart_failure \"Heart failure\") at his Lindenwald estate in\nKinderhook at 2:00 a.m. on July 24, 1862, at the age of 79.[188] He is buried\nin the [Kinderhook Reformed Dutch\nChurch](/wiki/Reformed_Dutch_Church_\\(Kinderhook,_New_York\\) \"Reformed Dutch\nChurch \\(Kinderhook, New York\\)\") Cemetery, as are his wife Hannah, his\nparents, and his son Martin Van Buren, Jr.[189]\n\nHe is the only U.S. president to have been alive during both the U.S.\nRevolutionary War and the U.S. Civil War.
