        "# Alternation of generations\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nThis article describes alternation of generations in plants; for a similar\nphenomenon in animals see [Heterogamy](/wiki/Heterogamy \"Heterogamy\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Alternation_of_generations_simpler.svg/360px-\nAlternation_of_generations_simpler.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Alternation_of_generations_simpler.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Alternation_of_generations_simpler.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDiagram showing the alternation of generations between a diploid sporophyte\n(bottom) and a haploid gametophyte (top)\n\n**Alternation of generations** (also known as **metagenesis**) is the type of\n[life cycle](/wiki/Biological_life_cycle \"Biological life cycle\") that occurs\nin those [plants](/wiki/Plant \"Plant\") and [algae](/wiki/Algae \"Algae\") in the\n[Archaeplastida](/wiki/Archaeplastida \"Archaeplastida\") and the\n[Heterokontophyta](/wiki/Heterokontophyta \"Heterokontophyta\") that have\ndistinct sexual haploid and asexual diploid stages. In these groups, a\nmulticellular [gametophyte](/wiki/Gametophyte \"Gametophyte\"), which is\n[haploid](/wiki/Haploid \"Haploid\") with _n_ [chromosomes](/wiki/Chromosome\n\"Chromosome\"), alternates with a multicellular [sporophyte](/wiki/Sporophyte\n\"Sporophyte\"), which is [diploid](/wiki/Diploid \"Diploid\") with 2 _n_\nchromosomes, made up of _n_ pairs. A mature sporophyte produces\n[spores](/wiki/Spore \"Spore\") by [meiosis](/wiki/Meiosis \"Meiosis\"), a process\nwhich reduces the number of chromosomes to half, from 2 _n_ to _n_.\n\nThe haploid spores germinate and grow into a haploid gametophyte. At maturity,\nthe gametophyte produces [gametes](/wiki/Gamete \"Gamete\") by\n[mitosis](/wiki/Mitosis \"Mitosis\"), which does not alter the number of\nchromosomes. Two gametes (originating from different organisms of the same\n[species](/wiki/Species \"Species\") or from the same organism)\n[fuse](/wiki/Fertilisation \"Fertilisation\") to produce a [zygote](/wiki/Zygote\n\"Zygote\"), which develops into a diploid sporophyte. This cycle, from\ngametophyte to gametophyte (or equally from sporophyte to sporophyte), is the\nway in which all land plants and many [algae](/wiki/Algae \"Algae\") undergo\n[sexual reproduction](/wiki/Sexual_reproduction \"Sexual reproduction\").\n\nThe relationship between the sporophyte and gametophyte varies among different\ngroups of plants. In those [algae](/wiki/Alga \"Alga\") which have alternation\nof generations, the sporophyte and gametophyte are separate independent\norganisms, which may or may not have a similar appearance. In\n[liverworts](/wiki/Liverwort \"Liverwort\"), [mosses](/wiki/Moss \"Moss\") and\n[hornworts](/wiki/Hornwort \"Hornwort\"), the sporophyte is less well developed\nthan the gametophyte and is largely dependent on it. Although moss and\nhornwort sporophytes can photosynthesise, they require additional\nphotosynthate from the gametophyte to sustain growth and spore development and\ndepend on it for supply of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen.[1][2] By\ncontrast, in all modern [vascular plants](/wiki/Vascular_plants \"Vascular\nplants\") the gametophyte is less well developed than the sporophyte, although\ntheir Devonian ancestors had gametophytes and sporophytes of approximately\nequivalent complexity.[3] In [ferns](/wiki/Fern \"Fern\") the gametophyte is a\nsmall flattened [autotrophic](/wiki/Autotrophic \"Autotrophic\")\n[prothallus](/wiki/Prothallium \"Prothallium\") on which the young sporophyte is\nbriefly dependent for its nutrition. In [flowering\nplants](/wiki/Flowering_plant \"Flowering plant\"), the reduction of the\ngametophyte is much more extreme; it consists of just a few cells which grow\nentirely inside the sporophyte.\n\nAnimals develop differently. They _directly_ produce haploid gametes. No\nhaploid spores capable of dividing are produced, so they do not have a haploid\ngametophyte alternating with a diploid sporophyte. (Some insects have a [sex-\ndetermining system](/wiki/Arrhenotoky \"Arrhenotoky\") whereby haploid males are\nproduced from unfertilized eggs; however the females are diploid.)\n\nLife cycles of plants and algae with alternating haploid and diploid\nmulticellular stages are referred to as **diplohaplontic** (the equivalent\nterms **haplodiplontic** , **diplobiontic** or **dibiontic** are also in use).\nLife cycles, such as those of animals, in which there is only a diploid\nmulticellular stage are referred to as **diplontic**. Life cycles in which\nthere is only a haploid multicellular stage are referred to as **haplontic**.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Definition\n    * 1.1 History\n  * 2 Alternation of generations in plants\n    * 2.1 Fundamental elements\n    * 2.2 Variations\n    * 2.3 A complex life cycle\n  * 3 Life cycles of different plant groups\n  * 4 Evolutionary emergence of the dominant diploid phase\n  * 5 Similar processes in other organisms\n    * 5.1 Rhizaria\n    * 5.2 Fungi\n    * 5.3 Slime moulds\n    * 5.4 Animals\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 Notes and references\n  * 8 Bibliography\n\n##\nDefinition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Definition\")]\n\nAlternation of generations is defined as the alternation of multicellular\ndiploid and haploid forms in the organism's life cycle, regardless of whether\nor not these forms are free-living.[4] In some species, such as the alga\n_[Ulva lactuca](/wiki/Ulva_lactuca \"Ulva lactuca\")_ , the diploid and haploid\nforms are indeed both free-living independent organisms, essentially identical\nin appearance and therefore said to be isomorphic. The free-swimming, haploid\ngametes form a diploid zygote which germinates into a multicellular diploid\nsporophyte. The sporophyte produces free-swimming haploid spores by\n[meiosis](/wiki/Meiosis \"Meiosis\") that germinate into haploid\ngametophytes.[5]\n\nHowever, in some other groups, either the sporophyte or the gametophyte is\nvery much reduced and is incapable of free living. For example, in all\n[bryophytes](/wiki/Bryophytes \"Bryophytes\") the gametophyte generation is\ndominant and the sporophyte is dependent on it. By contrast, in all modern\n[vascular land plants](/wiki/Vascular_plants \"Vascular plants\") the\ngametophytes are strongly reduced, although the fossil evidence indicates that\nthey were derived from isomorphic ancestors.[3] In [seed\nplants](/wiki/Seed_plant \"Seed plant\"), the female gametophyte develops\ntotally within the sporophyte which protects and nurtures it and the embryo\nsporophyte that it produces. The pollen grains, which are the male\ngametophytes, are reduced to only a few cells (just three cells in many\ncases). Here the notion of two generations is less obvious; as Bateman &\nDimichele say \"[s]porophyte and gametophyte effectively function as a single\norganism\".[6] The alternative term 'alternation of phases' may then be more\nappropriate.[7]\n\n###\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nDebates about alternation of generations in the early twentieth century can be\nconfusing because various ways of classifying \"generations\" co-exist (sexual\nvs. asexual, gametophyte vs. sporophyte, haploid vs. diploid, etc.).[8]\n\nInitially, [Chamisso](/wiki/Chamisso \"Chamisso\") and\n[Steenstrup](/wiki/Japetus_Steenstrup \"Japetus Steenstrup\") described the\nsuccession of differently organized generations (sexual and asexual) in\nanimals as \"alternation of generations\", while studying the development of\n[tunicates](/wiki/Tunicate \"Tunicate\"), [cnidarians](/wiki/Cnidarian\n\"Cnidarian\") and [trematode](/wiki/Trematode \"Trematode\") animals.[8] This\nphenomenon is also known as [heterogamy](/wiki/Heterogamy \"Heterogamy\").\nPresently, the term \"alternation of generations\" is almost exclusively\nassociated with the life cycles of plants, specifically with the alternation\nof haploid gametophytes and diploid sporophytes.[8]\n\n[Wilhelm Hofmeister](/wiki/Wilhelm_Hofmeister \"Wilhelm Hofmeister\")\ndemonstrated the morphological alternation of generations in plants,[9]\nbetween a spore-bearing generation (sporophyte) and a gamete-bearing\ngeneration (gametophyte).[10][11] By that time, a debate emerged focusing on\nthe origin of the asexual generation of land plants (i.e., the sporophyte) and\nis conventionally characterized as a conflict between theories of antithetic\n([Čelakovský](/wiki/Ladislav_Josef_%C4%8Celakovsk%C3%BD \"Ladislav Josef\nČelakovský\"), 1874) and homologous ([Pringsheim](/wiki/Nathanael_Pringsheim\n\"Nathanael Pringsheim\"), 1876) alternation of generations.[8] Čelakovský\ncoined the words sporophyte and gametophyte.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[Eduard Strasburger](/wiki/Eduard_Strasburger \"Eduard Strasburger\") (1874)\ndiscovered the alternation between diploid and haploid nuclear phases,[8] also\ncalled cytological alternation of nuclear phases.[12] Although most often\ncoinciding, morphological alternation and nuclear phases alternation are\nsometimes independent of one another, e.g., in many [red\nalgae](/wiki/Red_algae \"Red algae\"), the same nuclear phase may correspond to\ntwo diverse morphological generations.[12] In some [ferns](/wiki/Fern \"Fern\")\nwhich lost sexual reproduction, there is no change in nuclear phase, but the\nalternation of generations is maintained.[13]\n\n## Alternation of generations in\nplants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Alternation of generations in plants\")]\n\n### Fundamental\nelements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Fundamental elements\")]\n\nThe diagram above shows the fundamental elements of the alternation of\ngenerations in plants. The many variations found in different groups of plants\nare described by use of these concepts later in the article. Starting from the\nright of the diagram, the processes involved are as follows:[14]\n\n  * Two single-celled haploid gametes, each containing _n_ unpaired chromosomes, fuse to form a single-celled diploid zygote, which now contains _n_ pairs of chromosomes, i.e. 2 _n_ chromosomes in total.\n  * The single-celled diploid zygote germinates, dividing by the normal process ([mitosis](/wiki/Mitosis \"Mitosis\")), which maintains the number of chromosomes at 2 _n_. The result is a multi-cellular diploid organism, called the _sporophyte_ (because at maturity it produces spores).\n  * When it reaches maturity, the sporophyte produces one or more **sporangia** (singular: sporangium) which are the organs that produce diploid spore mother cells (sporocytes). These divide by a special process ([meiosis](/wiki/Meiosis \"Meiosis\")) that reduces the number of chromosomes by a half. This initially results in four single-celled haploid spores, each containing _n_ unpaired chromosomes.\n  * The single-celled haploid spore germinates, dividing by the normal process (mitosis), which maintains the number of chromosomes at _n_. The result is a multi-cellular haploid organism, called the _gametophyte_ (because it produces gametes at maturity).\n  * When it reaches maturity, the gametophyte produces one or more **gametangia** (singular: gametangium) which are the organs that produce haploid gametes. At least one kind of gamete possesses some mechanism for reaching another gamete in order to fuse with it.\n\nThe 'alternation of generations' in the life cycle is thus between a diploid\n(2 _n_) generation of sporophytes and a haploid (_n_) generation of\ngametophytes.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Onoclea_sensibilis_4_crop.jpg/220px-\nOnoclea_sensibilis_4_crop.jpg)](/wiki/File:Onoclea_sensibilis_4_crop.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Onoclea_sensibilis_4_crop.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGametophyte of the fern _[Onoclea sensibilis](/wiki/Onoclea_sensibilis\n\"Onoclea sensibilis\")_ (the flat thallus at the bottom of the picture) with a\ndescendant sporophyte beginning to grow from it (the small frond at the top of\nthe picture).\n\nThe situation is quite different from that in animals, where the fundamental\nprocess is that a diploid (2 _n_) individual _directly_ produces haploid (_n_)\ngametes by meiosis. Spores (i.e. haploid cells which are able to undergo\nmitosis) are not produced, so neither is an asexual multi-cellular generation\nthat alternates with a sexual multi-cellular generation. (Some insects have\nhaploid males that develop from unfertilized eggs, but the females are all\ndiploid.)\n\n###\nVariations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Variations\")]\n\nThe diagram shown above is a good representation of the life cycle of some\nmulti-cellular algae (e.g. the genus _[Cladophora](/wiki/Cladophora\n\"Cladophora\")_) which have sporophytes and gametophytes of almost identical\nappearance and which do not have different kinds of spores or gametes.[15]\n\nHowever, there are many possible variations on the fundamental elements of a\nlife cycle which has alternation of generations. Each variation may occur\nseparately or in combination, resulting in a bewildering variety of life\ncycles. The terms used by botanists in describing these life cycles can be\nequally bewildering. As Bateman and Dimichele say \"[...] the alternation of\ngenerations has become a terminological morass; often, one term represents\nseveral concepts or one concept is represented by several terms.\"[16]\n\nPossible variations are:\n\n  * _Relative importance of the sporophyte and the gametophyte._\n    * _Equal_ (**homomorphy** or **isomorphy**).  \nFilamentous algae of the genus _[Cladophora](/wiki/Cladophora \"Cladophora\")_ ,\nwhich are predominantly found in fresh water, have diploid sporophytes and\nhaploid gametophytes which are externally indistinguishable.[17] No living\nland plant has equally dominant sporophytes and gametophytes, although some\ntheories of the evolution of alternation of generations suggest that ancestral\nland plants did.\n\n    * _Unequal_ (**heteromorphy** or **anisomorphy**).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Mnium_hornum_2005.04.02_14.55.41.jpg/220px-\nMnium_hornum_2005.04.02_14.55.41.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mnium_hornum_2005.04.02_14.55.41.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mnium_hornum_2005.04.02_14.55.41.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGametophyte of _[Mnium\nhornum](/w/index.php?title=Mnium_hornum&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Mnium hornum\n\\(page does not exist\\)\")_ , a moss.\n\n      * _Dominant gametophyte_ (**gametophytic**).  \nIn liverworts, mosses and hornworts, the dominant form is the haploid\ngametophyte. The diploid sporophyte is not capable of an independent\nexistence, gaining most of its nutrition from the parent gametophyte, and\nhaving no chlorophyll when mature.[18]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Blechnum_discolor_-\n_crown_fern.jpg/220px-Blechnum_discolor_-\n_crown_fern.jpg)](/wiki/File:Blechnum_discolor_-_crown_fern.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Blechnum_discolor_-_crown_fern.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSporophyte of _[Blechnum discolor](/wiki/Blechnum_discolor \"Blechnum\ndiscolor\")_ , a fern.\n\n      * _Dominant sporophyte_ (**sporophytic**).  \nIn ferns, both the sporophyte and the gametophyte are capable of living\nindependently, but the dominant form is the diploid sporophyte. The haploid\ngametophyte is much smaller and simpler in structure. In seed plants, the\ngametophyte is even more reduced (at the minimum to only three cells), gaining\nall its nutrition from the sporophyte. The extreme reduction in the size of\nthe gametophyte and its retention within the sporophyte means that when\napplied to seed plants the term 'alternation of generations' is somewhat\nmisleading: \"[s]porophyte and gametophyte effectively function as a single\norganism\".[6] Some authors have preferred the term 'alternation of phases'.[7]\n\n  * _Differentiation of the gametes._\n    * _Both gametes the same_ (**isogamy**).  \nLike other species of _[Cladophora](/wiki/Cladophora \"Cladophora\")_ , _C.\ncallicoma_ has flagellated gametes which are identical in appearance and\nability to move.[17]\n\n    * _Gametes of two distinct sizes_ (**anisogamy**). \n      * _Both of similar motility_.  \nSpecies of _[Ulva](/wiki/Sea_lettuce \"Sea lettuce\")_ , the sea lettuce, have\ngametes which all have two flagella and so are motile. However they are of two\nsizes: larger 'female' gametes and smaller 'male' gametes.[19]\n\n      * _One large and sessile, one small and motile_ (**oogamy**). The larger sessile megagametes are eggs (ova), and smaller motile microgametes are sperm (spermatozoa, spermatozoids). The degree of motility of the sperm may be very limited (as in the case of flowering plants) but all are able to move towards the sessile eggs. When (as is almost always the case) the sperm and eggs are produced in different kinds of gametangia, the sperm-producing ones are called **antheridia** (singular antheridium) and the egg-producing ones **archegonia** (singular archegonium).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Pellia_epiphylla_IMG_1610.jpg/220px-\nPellia_epiphylla_IMG_1610.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pellia_epiphylla_IMG_1610.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pellia_epiphylla_IMG_1610.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGametophyte of _[Pellia epiphylla](/wiki/Pellia_epiphylla \"Pellia epiphylla\")_\nwith sporophytes growing from the remains of archegonia.\n\n        * _Antheridia and archegonia occur on the same gametophyte,_ which is then called **[monoicous](/wiki/Monoicous \"Monoicous\")**. (Many sources, including those concerned with bryophytes, use the term 'monoecious' for this situation and 'dioecious' for the opposite.[20][21] Here 'monoecious' and 'dioecious' are used only for sporophytes.)  \nThe liverwort _Pellia epiphylla_ has the gametophyte as the dominant\ngeneration. It is monoicous: the small reddish sperm-producing antheridia are\nscattered along the midrib while the egg-producing archegonia grow nearer the\ntips of divisions of the plant.[22]\n\n        * _Antheridia and archegonia occur on different gametophytes,_ which are then called **dioicous**.  \nThe moss _Mnium hornum_ has the gametophyte as the dominant generation. It is\ndioicous: male plants produce only antheridia in terminal rosettes, female\nplants produce only archegonia in the form of stalked capsules.[23] Seed plant\ngametophytes are also dioicous. However, the parent sporophyte may be\nmonoecious, producing both male and female gametophytes or dioecious,\nproducing gametophytes of one gender only. Seed plant gametophytes are\nextremely reduced in size; the archegonium consists only of a small number of\ncells, and the entire male gametophyte may be represented by only two\ncells.[24]\n\n  * _Differentiation of the spores._\n    * _All spores the same size_ (**homospory** or isospory).  \nHorsetails (species of _[Equisetum](/wiki/Equisetum \"Equisetum\")_) have spores\nwhich are all of the same size.[25]\n\n    * _Spores of two distinct sizes_ (**heterospory** or anisospory): larger **megaspores** and smaller **microspores**. When the two kinds of spore are produced in different kinds of sporangia, these are called **megasporangia** and **microsporangia**. A megaspore often (but not always) develops at the expense of the other three cells resulting from meiosis, which abort. \n      * _Megasporangia and microsporangia occur on the same sporophyte,_ which is then called **monoecious**.  \nMost flowering plants fall into this category. Thus the flower of a lily\ncontains six stamens (the microsporangia) which produce microspores which\ndevelop into pollen grains (the microgametophytes), and three fused carpels\nwhich produce integumented megasporangia (ovules) each of which produces a\nmegaspore which develops inside the megasporangium to produce the\nmegagametophyte. In other plants, such as hazel, some flowers have only\nstamens, others only carpels, but the same plant (i.e. sporophyte) has both\nkinds of flower and so is monoecious.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Hollyflowers.jpg/220px-\nHollyflowers.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hollyflowers.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hollyflowers.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFlowers of European Holly, a dioecious species: male above, female below\n(leaves cut to show flowers more clearly)\n\n      * _Megasporangia and microsporangia occur on different sporophytes,_ which are then called **dioecious**.  \nAn individual tree of the European holly (_[Ilex\naquifolium](/wiki/Ilex_aquifolium \"Ilex aquifolium\")_) produces either 'male'\nflowers which have only functional stamens (microsporangia) producing\nmicrospores which develop into pollen grains (microgametophytes) or 'female'\nflowers which have only functional carpels producing integumented\nmegasporangia (ovules) that contain a megaspore that develops into a\nmulticellular megagametophyte.\n\nThere are some correlations between these variations, but they are just that,\ncorrelations, and not absolute. For example, in flowering plants, microspores\nultimately produce microgametes (sperm) and megaspores ultimately produce\nmegagametes (eggs). However, in ferns and their allies there are groups with\nundifferentiated spores but differentiated gametophytes. For example, the fern\n_[Ceratopteris](/wiki/Ceratopteris \"Ceratopteris\") thalictrioides_ has spores\nof only one kind, which vary continuously in size. Smaller spores tend to\ngerminate into gametophytes which produce only sperm-producing antheridia.[25]\n\n### A complex life\ncycle[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: A complex life cycle\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Alternation_of_generations_complex.svg/500px-\nAlternation_of_generations_complex.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Alternation_of_generations_complex.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Alternation_of_generations_complex.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGraphic referred in text.\n\nThe diagram shows the alternation of generations in a species which is\nheteromorphic, sporophytic, oogametic, dioicous, heterosporic and dioecious. A\nseed plant example might be a [willow](/wiki/Willow \"Willow\") tree (most\nspecies of the genus _Salix_ are dioecious).[26] Starting in the centre of the\ndiagram, the processes involved are:\n\n  * An immobile egg, contained in the archegonium, fuses with a mobile sperm, released from an antheridium. The resulting zygote is either '**male '** or '**female '**. \n    * A '**male '** zygote develops by mitosis into a microsporophyte, which at maturity produces one or more microsporangia. Microspores develop within the microsporangium by meiosis.  \nIn a willow (like all seed plants) the zygote first develops into an embryo\nmicrosporophyte within the ovule (a megasporangium enclosed in one or more\nprotective layers of tissue known as integument). At maturity, these\nstructures become the [seed](/wiki/Seed \"Seed\"). Later the seed is shed,\ngerminates and grows into a mature tree. A 'male' willow tree (a\nmicrosporophyte) produces flowers with only stamens, the anthers of which are\nthe microsporangia.\n\n    * Microspores germinate producing microgametophytes; at maturity one or more antheridia are produced. Sperm develop within the antheridia.  \nIn a willow, microspores are not liberated from the anther (the\nmicrosporangium), but develop into pollen grains (microgametophytes) within\nit. The whole pollen grain is moved (e.g. by an insect or by the wind) to an\novule (megagametophyte), where a sperm is produced which moves down a pollen\ntube to reach the egg.\n\n    * A '**female '** zygote develops by mitosis into a megasporophyte, which at maturity produces one or more megasporangia. Megaspores develop within the megasporangium; typically one of the four spores produced by meiosis gains bulk at the expense of the remaining three, which disappear.  \n'Female' willow trees (megasporophytes) produce flowers with only carpels\n(modified leaves that bear the megasporangia).\n\n    * Megaspores germinate producing megagametophytes; at maturity one or more archegonia are produced. Eggs develop within the archegonia.  \nThe carpels of a willow produce ovules, megasporangia enclosed in integuments.\nWithin each ovule, a megaspore develops by mitosis into a megagametophyte. An\narchegonium develops within the megagametophyte and produces an egg. The whole\nof the gametophytic 'generation' remains within the protection of the\nsporophyte except for pollen grains (which have been reduced to just three\ncells contained within the microspore wall).\n\n## Life cycles of different plant\ngroups[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Life cycles of different plant groups\")]\n\nThe term \"plants\" is taken here to mean the\n[Archaeplastida](/wiki/Archaeplastida \"Archaeplastida\"), i.e. the\n[glaucophytes](/wiki/Glaucophyte \"Glaucophyte\"), [red](/wiki/Red_algae \"Red\nalgae\") and [green algae](/wiki/Green_algae \"Green algae\") and [land\nplants](/wiki/Land_plants \"Land plants\").\n\nAlternation of generations occurs in almost all multicellular red and green\nalgae, both freshwater forms (such as _[Cladophora](/wiki/Cladophora\n\"Cladophora\")_) and seaweeds (such as _[Ulva](/wiki/Ulva_\\(genus\\) \"Ulva\n\\(genus\\)\")_). In most, the generations are homomorphic (isomorphic) and free-\nliving. Some species of red algae have a complex triphasic alternation of\ngenerations, in which there is a gametophyte phase and two distinct sporophyte\nphases. For further information, see [Red algae:\nReproduction](/wiki/Red_algae#Reproduction \"Red algae\").\n\nLand plants all have heteromorphic (anisomorphic) alternation of generations,\nin which the sporophyte and gametophyte are distinctly different. All\n[bryophytes](/wiki/Bryophyte \"Bryophyte\"), i.e.\n[liverworts](/wiki/Marchantiophyta \"Marchantiophyta\"), [mosses](/wiki/Moss\n\"Moss\") and [hornworts](/wiki/Hornwort \"Hornwort\"), have the gametophyte\ngeneration as the most conspicuous. As an illustration, consider a monoicous\nmoss. Antheridia and archegonia develop on the mature plant (the gametophyte).\nIn the presence of water, the biflagellate sperm from the antheridia swim to\nthe archegonia and fertilisation occurs, leading to the production of a\ndiploid sporophyte. The sporophyte grows up from the archegonium. Its body\ncomprises a long stalk topped by a capsule within which spore-producing cells\nundergo meiosis to form haploid spores. Most mosses rely on the wind to\ndisperse these spores, although _[Splachnum\nsphaericum](/wiki/Splachnum_sphaericum \"Splachnum sphaericum\")_ is\n[entomophilous](/wiki/Entomophilous \"Entomophilous\"), recruiting insects to\ndisperse its spores.

The haploid spores develop in [sori](/wiki/Sorus \"Sorus\") on the\nunderside of the fronds and are dispersed by the wind (or in some cases, by\nfloating on water). If conditions are right, a spore will germinate and grow\ninto a rather inconspicuous plant body called a [prothallus](/wiki/Prothallus\n\"Prothallus\"). The haploid prothallus does not resemble the sporophyte, and as\nsuch ferns and their allies have a heteromorphic alternation of generations.\nThe prothallus is short-lived, but carries out sexual reproduction, producing\nthe diploid [zygote](/wiki/Zygote \"Zygote\") that then grows out of the\nprothallus as the sporophyte.

The entire\ngametophyte generation, with the sole exception of pollen grains\n(microgametophytes), is contained within the sporophyte. The life cycle of a\ndioecious flowering plant (angiosperm), the willow, has been outlined in some\ndetail in an earlier section (A complex life cycle). The life cycle of a\n[gymnosperm](/wiki/Gymnosperm \"Gymnosperm\") is similar. However, flowering\nplants have in addition a phenomenon called '[double\nfertilization](/wiki/Double_fertilization \"Double fertilization\")'. Two sperm\nnuclei from a pollen grain (the microgametophyte), rather than a single sperm,\nenter the archegonium of the megagametophyte; one fuses with the egg nucleus\nto form the zygote, the other fuses with two other nuclei of the gametophyte\nto form '[endosperm](/wiki/Endosperm \"Endosperm\")', which nourishes the\ndeveloping embryo. For further information, see [Double\nfertilization](/wiki/Double_fertilization \"Double fertilization\").\n\n## Evolutionary emergence of the dominant diploid\nphase[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Evolutionary emergence of the dominant diploid phase\")]\n\nIt has been proposed that the basis for the emergence of the diploid phase of\nthe life cycle (sporophyte) as the dominant phase (e.g. as in vascular plants)\nis that diploidy allows masking of the expression of deleterious mutations\nthrough [genetic complementation](/wiki/Complementation_\\(genetics\\)\n\"Complementation \\(genetics\\)\").[27][28] Thus if one of the parental genomes\nin the diploid cells contained [mutations](/wiki/Mutation \"Mutation\") leading\nto defects in one or more [gene products](/wiki/Gene_product \"Gene product\"),\nthese deficiencies could be compensated for by the other parental genome\n(which nevertheless may have its own defects in other genes). As the diploid\nphase was becoming predominant, the masking effect likely allowed [genome\nsize](/wiki/Genome_size \"Genome size\"), and hence information content, to\nincrease without the constraint of having to improve accuracy of DNA\nreplication. The opportunity to increase information content at low cost was\nadvantageous because it permitted new adaptations to be encoded. This view has\nbeen challenged, with evidence showing that selection is no more effective in\nthe haploid than in the diploid phases of the lifecycle of mosses and\nangiosperms.[29]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Angiosperm_life_cycle_diagram-en.svg/104px-Angiosperm_life_cycle_diagram-en.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Angiosperm_life_cycle_diagram-en.svg)\n\nAngiosperm life cycle\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Tulip_Stamen_Tip.jpg/80px-Tulip_Stamen_Tip.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tulip_Stamen_Tip.jpg)\n\nTip of tulip stamen showing pollen (microgametophytes)\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Ovule-Gymno-Angio-en.svg/120px-Ovule-Gymno-Angio-en.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Ovule-Gymno-Angio-en.svg)\n\nPlant ovules (megagametophytes): Gymnosperm ovule on left, angiosperm ovule\n(inside ovary) on right\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Double_Fertilization.jpg/120px-Double_Fertilization.jpg)](/wiki/File:Double_Fertilization.jpg)\n\nDouble fertilization\n\n## Similar processes in other\norganisms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Similar processes in other organisms\")]\n\n###\nRhizaria[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Rhizaria\")]\n\nSome organisms currently classified in the clade [Rhizaria](/wiki/Rhizaria\n\"Rhizaria\") and thus not plants in the sense used here, exhibit alternation of\ngenerations. [Foraminifera](/wiki/Foraminifera \"Foraminifera\") undergo a\nheteromorphic alternation of generations between haploid _**gamont**_ and\ndiploid _**agamont**_ forms. The single-celled haploid organism is typically\nmuch larger than the diploid organism.\n\n###\nFungi[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Fungi\")]\n\nFungal [mycelia](/wiki/Mycelia \"Mycelia\") are typically haploid. When mycelia\nof different mating types meet, they produce two\n[multinucleate](/wiki/Multinucleate \"Multinucleate\") ball-shaped cells, which\njoin via a \"mating bridge\". Nuclei move from one mycelium into the other,\nforming a _**[heterokaryon](/wiki/Heterokaryon \"Heterokaryon\")**_ (meaning\n\"different nuclei\"). This process is called _**[plasmogamy](/wiki/Plasmogamy\n\"Plasmogamy\")**_. Actual fusion to form [diploid](/wiki/Diploid \"Diploid\")\nnuclei is called _**[karyogamy](/wiki/Karyogamy \"Karyogamy\")**_ , and may not\noccur until [sporangia](/wiki/Sporangia \"Sporangia\") are formed. Karogamy\nproduces a diploid zygote, which is a short-lived sporophyte that soon\nundergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. When the spores germinate, they\ndevelop into new mycelia.\n\n### Slime\nmoulds[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Slime moulds\")]\n\nThe life cycle of [slime moulds](/wiki/Slime_mould \"Slime mould\") is very\nsimilar to that of fungi. Haploid spores germinate to form swarm cells or\n_**myxamoebae**_. These fuse in a process referred to as _plasmogamy_ and\n_karyogamy_ to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into a plasmodium,\nand the mature plasmodium produces, depending on the species, one to many\nfruiting bodies containing haploid spores.\n\n###\nAnimals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Animals\")]\n\nAlternation between a multicellular diploid and a multicellular haploid\ngeneration is never encountered in animals.[30] In some animals, there is an\nalternation between [parthenogenic](/wiki/Parthenogenesis \"Parthenogenesis\")\nand [sexually reproductive](/wiki/Sexual_reproduction \"Sexual reproduction\")\nphases ([heterogamy](/wiki/Heterogamy \"Heterogamy\")). Both phases are diploid.\nThis has sometimes been called \"alternation of generations\",[31] but is quite\ndifferent. In some other animals, such as [hymenopterans](/wiki/Hymenoptera\n\"Hymenoptera\"), males are haploid and females diploid, but this is always the\ncase rather than there being an alternation between distinct generations.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Evolutionary history of plants#life cycles](/wiki/Evolutionary_history_of_plants#life_cycles \"Evolutionary history of plants\"): Evolutionary origin of the alternation of phases\n  * [Ploidy](/wiki/Ploidy \"Ploidy\")\n  * [Biological life cycle](/wiki/Biological_life_cycle \"Biological life cycle\")\n  * [Apomixis](/wiki/Apomixis \"Apomixis\")\n\n## Notes and\nreferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alternation_of_generations&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Notes and references\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Thomas, R.J.; Stanton, D.S.; Longendorfer, D.H. & Farr, M.E.
