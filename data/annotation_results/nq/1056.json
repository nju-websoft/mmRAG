Such an impact\nbetween Earth and a [Mars-sized object](/wiki/Theia_\\(planet\\) \"Theia\n\\(planet\\)\") likely formed the Moon.\n\nThe **giant-impact hypothesis** , sometimes called the **Big Splash** , or\n**the Theia Impact** suggests that the [Moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\") formed out of\nthe debris left over from a collision between Earth and an astronomical body\nthe size of [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\"), approximately 4.5 billion years ago, in\nthe [Hadean](/wiki/Hadean \"Hadean\") eon; about 20 to 100 million years after\nthe solar system coalesced.[1] The colliding body is sometimes called\n[Theia](/wiki/Theia_\\(planet\\) \"Theia \\(planet\\)\"), from the name of [the\nmythical Greek Titan](/wiki/Theia \"Theia\") who was the mother of\n[Selene](/wiki/Selene \"Selene\"), the goddess of the Moon.[2] Analysis of lunar\nrocks, published in a 2016 report, suggests that the impact may have been a\ndirect hit, causing a thorough mixing of both parent bodies.[3]\n\nThe giant-impact hypothesis is currently the favoured [scientific\nhypothesis](/wiki/Scientific_hypothesis \"Scientific hypothesis\") for the\nformation of the Moon.[4] Supporting evidence includes:\n\n  * Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit have similar orientations.[5]\n  * Moon samples indicate that [the Moon's surface was once molten](/wiki/Lunar_magma_ocean \"Lunar magma ocean\").\n  * The Moon has a relatively small iron [core](/wiki/Planetary_core \"Planetary core\").\n  * The Moon has a lower density than Earth.\n  * There is evidence in other star systems of similar collisions, resulting in [debris disks](/wiki/Debris_disk \"Debris disk\").\n  * Giant collisions are consistent with the leading theories of the [formation of the Solar System](/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System \"Formation and evolution of the Solar System\").\n  * The stable-isotope ratios of lunar and terrestrial rock are identical, implying a common origin.[6]\n\nThere remain several questions concerning the best current models of the\ngiant-impact hypothesis, however.[7] The energy of such a giant impact is\npredicted to have heated Earth to produce a global [magma\nocean](/wiki/Magma_ocean \"Magma ocean\"), and evidence of the resultant\n[planetary differentiation](/wiki/Planetary_differentiation \"Planetary\ndifferentiation\") of the heavier material sinking into Earth's mantle has been\ndocumented.[8] However, as of\n2015[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit) there is no self-consistent model that starts\nwith the giant-impact event and follows the evolution of the debris into a\nsingle moon. Other remaining questions include when the Moon lost its share of\n[volatile elements](/wiki/Volatility_\\(chemistry\\) \"Volatility \\(chemistry\\)\")\nand why [Venus](/wiki/Venus \"Venus\")—which experienced giant impacts during\nits formation—does not host a similar moon.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Theia\n  * 3 Basic model\n  * 4 Composition\n    * 4.1 Energetic aftermath theory\n  * 5 Evidence\n  * 6 Difficulties\n    * 6.1 Composition\n    * 6.2 Lack of a Venusian moon\n  * 7 Possible origin of Theia\n  * 8 Modified hypothesis\n  * 9 Alternative hypotheses\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n    * 11.1 Notes\n    * 11.2 Further reading\n  * 12 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\nIn 1898, [George Darwin](/wiki/George_Darwin \"George Darwin\") made the\nsuggestion that the Earth and Moon were once a single body. Darwin's\nhypothesis was that a molten Moon had been spun from the Earth because of\n[centrifugal forces](/wiki/Centrifugal_force_\\(rotating_reference_frame\\)\n\"Centrifugal force \\(rotating reference frame\\)\"), and this became the\ndominant academic explanation.[9] Using Newtonian mechanics, he calculated\nthat the Moon had orbited much more closely in the past and was drifting away\nfrom the Earth. This drifting was later confirmed by\n[American](/wiki/Apollo_program \"Apollo program\") and\n[Soviet](/wiki/Russian_Federal_Space_Agency \"Russian Federal Space Agency\")\nexperiments, using [laser ranging\ntargets](/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment \"Lunar Laser Ranging\nexperiment\") placed on the Moon.\n\nNonetheless, Darwin's calculations could not resolve the mechanics required to\ntrace the Moon backward to the surface of the Earth. In 1946, [Reginald\nAldworth Daly](/wiki/Reginald_Aldworth_Daly \"Reginald Aldworth Daly\") of\n[Harvard University](/wiki/Harvard_University \"Harvard University\") challenged\nDarwin's explanation, adjusting it to postulate that the creation of the Moon\nwas caused by an impact rather than centrifugal forces.[10] Little attention\nwas paid to Professor Daly's challenge until a conference on satellites in\n1974, during which the idea was reintroduced and later published and discussed\nin _[Icarus](/wiki/Icarus_\\(journal\\) \"Icarus \\(journal\\)\")_ in 1975 by Drs.\n[William K. Hartmann](/wiki/William_Kenneth_Hartmann \"William Kenneth\nHartmann\") and [Donald R. Davis](/wiki/Donald_R._Davis \"Donald R. Davis\").\nTheir models suggested that, at the end of the planet formation period,\nseveral satellite-sized bodies had formed that could collide with the planets\nor be captured. They proposed that one of these objects may have collided with\nthe Earth, ejecting refractory, volatile-poor dust that could coalesce to form\nthe Moon. This collision could potentially explain the unique geological and\ngeochemical properties of the Moon.[11]\n\nA similar approach was taken by Canadian astronomer [Alastair G. W.\nCameron](/wiki/Alastair_G._W._Cameron \"Alastair G. W. Cameron\") and American\nastronomer [William R.\nWard](/w/index.php?title=William_R._Ward&action=edit&redlink=1 \"William R.\nWard \\(page does not exist\\)\"), who suggested that the Moon was formed by the\ntangential impact upon Earth of a body the size of Mars. It is hypothesized\nthat most of the outer silicates of the colliding body would be vaporized,\nwhereas a metallic core would not. Hence, most of the collisional material\nsent into orbit would consist of silicates, leaving the coalescing Moon\ndeficient in iron. The more volatile materials that were emitted during the\ncollision probably would escape the Solar System, whereas silicates would tend\nto coalesce.[12]\n\n## Theia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Theia\")]\n\nMain article: [Theia (planet)](/wiki/Theia_\\(planet\\) \"Theia \\(planet\\)\")\n\nThe name of the hypothesized [protoplanet](/wiki/Protoplanet \"Protoplanet\") is\nderived from the mythical [Greek](/wiki/Greek_mythology \"Greek mythology\")\n[titan](/wiki/Titan_\\(mythology\\) \"Titan \\(mythology\\)\") [Theia](/wiki/Theia\n\"Theia\") [/ˈθiːə/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\"), who gave birth\nto the Moon goddess [Selene](/wiki/Selene \"Selene\"). This designation was\nproposed initially by the English geochemist [Alex N.\nHalliday](/wiki/Alexander_Halliday \"Alexander Halliday\") in 2000 and has\nbecome accepted in the scientific community.[2][13] According to modern\ntheories of planet formation, Theia was part of a population of Mars-sized\nbodies that existed in the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago. One of the\nattractive features of the giant-impact hypothesis is that the formation of\nthe Moon and Earth align; during the course of its formation, the Earth is\nthought to have experienced dozens of collisions with planet-sized bodies. The\nMoon-forming collision would have been only one such \"giant impact\" but\ncertainly the last significant impactor event. The [Late Heavy\nBombardment](/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment \"Late Heavy Bombardment\") by much\nsmaller asteroids occurred later - approximately 3.9 billion years ago.\n\n## Basic model[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Basic model\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Bigsplashsimple.png/220px-\nBigsplashsimple.png)](/wiki/File:Bigsplashsimple.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Bigsplashsimple.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSimplistic representation of the giant-impact hypothesis.\n\nAstronomers think the collision between Earth and Theia happened at about 4.4\nto 4.45 [bya](/wiki/Bya \"Bya\"); about 0.1 billion years after the [Solar\nSystem began to form](/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System\n\"Formation and evolution of the Solar System\").[14][15] In astronomical terms,\nthe impact would have been of moderate velocity. Theia is thought to have\nstruck the Earth at an [oblique angle](/wiki/Oblique_angle \"Oblique angle\")\nwhen the Earth was nearly fully formed. Computer simulations of this \"late-\nimpact\" scenario suggest an impact angle of about 45° and an initial impactor\nvelocity below 4 km/s.[16] However, [oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\")\n[isotope](/wiki/Isotope \"Isotope\") abundance in [lunar rock](/wiki/Lunar_rock\n\"Lunar rock\") suggests \"vigorous mixing\" of Theia and Earth, indicating a\nsteep impact angle.[3][17] Theia's iron [core](/wiki/Core_\\(geology\\) \"Core\n\\(geology\\)\") would have sunk into the young Earth's core, and most of Theia's\n[mantle](/wiki/Mantle_\\(geology\\) \"Mantle \\(geology\\)\") accreted onto the\nEarth's mantle. However, a significant portion of the mantle material from\nboth Theia and the Earth would have been [ejected](/wiki/Ejecta \"Ejecta\") into\norbit around the Earth (if ejected with velocities between [orbital\nvelocity](/wiki/Orbital_speed \"Orbital speed\") and [escape\nvelocity](/wiki/Escape_velocity \"Escape velocity\")) or into individual orbits\naround the sun (if ejected at higher velocities). The material in orbits\naround the Earth quickly coalesced into the Moon (possibly within less than a\nmonth, but in no more than a century). The material in orbits around the sun\nstayed on its [Kepler orbits](/wiki/Kepler_orbit \"Kepler orbit\"), which are\nstable in space, and was thus likely [to hit the earth-moon\nsystem](/wiki/Late_heavy_bombardment \"Late heavy bombardment\") sometime later\n(because the Earth-Moon system's Kepler orbit around the sun also remains\nstable). Estimates based on [computer simulations](/wiki/Computer_simulation\n\"Computer simulation\") of such an event suggest that some twenty percent of\nthe original mass of Theia would have ended up as an orbiting ring of debris\naround the Earth, and about half of this matter coalesced into the Moon.\n\nThe Earth would have gained significant amounts of [angular\nmomentum](/wiki/Angular_momentum \"Angular momentum\") and [mass](/wiki/Mass\n\"Mass\") from such a collision. Regardless of the speed and tilt of the Earth's\nrotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours\nlong after the impact, and the Earth's equator and the Moon's orbit would have\nbecome [coplanar](/wiki/Coplanarity \"Coplanarity\").[18]\n\nNot all of the ring material need have been swept up right away: the thickened\ncrust of the Moon's far side suggests the possibility that a second moon about\n1,000km in diameter formed in a [Lagrange point](/wiki/Lagrange_point\n\"Lagrange point\") of the Moon. The secondary, smaller moon may have remained\nin orbit for tens of millions of years. As the two moons migrated outward from\nthe Earth, solar tidal effects would have made the Lagrange orbit unstable,\nresulting in a slow-velocity collision that \"pancaked\" the smaller moon onto\nwhat is now the far side, adding material to the crust.[19][20] Lunar magma\ncannot pierce through the thick crust of the far side, causing lesser lunar\nmaria, while the near side has a thin crust displaying the large maria visible\nfrom Earth.[21]\n\n## Composition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\nIn 2001, a team at the [Carnegie Institution of\nWashington](/wiki/Carnegie_Institution_for_Science \"Carnegie Institution for\nScience\") reported the surprising finding that the rocks from the [Apollo\nprogram](/wiki/Apollo_program \"Apollo program\") carried an isotopic signature\nthat was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all\nother bodies in the Solar System.[6]\n\nIn 2014, a team in Germany reported that the Apollo samples had a slightly\ndifferent isotopic signature from Earth rocks.[22] The difference was slight,\nbut statistically significant. One possible explanation is that Theia formed\nnear the Earth.[23]\n\n### Energetic aftermath theory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Energetic aftermath\ntheory\")]\n\nIn 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology showed that\nthe likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth\nwas very small (less than 1 percent).[24] They proposed that in the aftermath\nof the giant impact, while the Earth and the proto-lunar disk were molten and\nvaporized, the two reservoirs were connected by a common silicate vapour\natmosphere, and that the Earth–Moon system became homogenized by convective\nstirring while the system existed in the form of a continuous fluid. Such an\n\"equilibration\" between the post-impact Earth and the proto-lunar disk is the\nonly proposed scenario that explains the isotopic similarities of the Apollo\nrocks with rocks from the Earth's interior. For this scenario to be viable,\nhowever, the proto-lunar disk would have to endure for about 100 years. Work\nis ongoing to determine whether or not this is possible.\n\n## Evidence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Evidence\")]\n\nIndirect evidence for the giant impact scenario comes from rocks collected\nduring the [Apollo Moon landings](/wiki/Apollo_Moon_landing \"Apollo Moon\nlanding\"), which show [oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\") [isotope](/wiki/Isotope\n\"Isotope\") ratios nearly identical to those of Earth. The highly\n[anorthositic](/wiki/Anorthositic \"Anorthositic\") composition of the lunar\ncrust, as well as the existence of [KREEP](/wiki/KREEP \"KREEP\")-rich samples,\nsuggest that a large portion of the Moon once was molten; and a giant impact\nscenario could easily have supplied the energy needed to form such a [magma\nocean](/wiki/Lunar_magma_ocean \"Lunar magma ocean\"). Several lines of evidence\nshow that if the Moon has an [iron](/wiki/Iron \"Iron\")-rich core, it must be a\nsmall one. In particular, the mean density, moment of inertia, rotational\nsignature, and magnetic induction response of the Moon all suggest that the\nradius of its core is less than about 25% the radius of the Moon, in contrast\nto about 50% for most of the other [terrestrial](/wiki/Terrestrial_planet\n\"Terrestrial planet\") bodies. Appropriate impact conditions satisfying the\nangular momentum constraints of the Earth–Moon system yield a Moon formed\nmostly from the mantles of the Earth and the impactor, while the core of the\nimpactor accretes to the Earth.[4] It is noteworthy that the Earth has the\nhighest density of all the planets in the Solar system ; the absorption of the\ncore of the impactor body explains this observation, given the proposed\nproperties of the early Earth and Theia.\n\nComparison of the [zinc](/wiki/Zinc \"Zinc\") isotopic composition of Lunar\nsamples with that of Earth and [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\") rocks provides\nfurther evidence for the impact hypothesis.[25] [Zinc](/wiki/Zinc \"Zinc\") is\nstrongly [fractionated](/wiki/Isotope_fractionation \"Isotope fractionation\")\nwhen [volatilized](/wiki/Volatilization \"Volatilization\") in planetary\nrocks,[26][27] but not during normal [igneous](/wiki/Igneous \"Igneous\")\nprocesses,[28] so zinc abundance and isotopic composition can distinguish the\ntwo geological processes. Moon rocks contain more heavy isotopes of zinc, and\noverall less zinc, than corresponding igneous Earth or Mars rocks, which is\nconsistent with zinc being depleted from the Moon through evaporation, as\nexpected for the giant impact origin.[25]\n\nCollisions between ejecta escaping Earth's gravity and asteroids would have\nleft impact heating signatures in stony meteorites; analysis based on assuming\nthe existence of this effect has been used to date the impact event to 4.47\nbillion years ago, in agreement with the date obtained by other means.[29]\n\nWarm silica-rich dust and abundant SiO gas, products of high velocity (> 10\nkm/s) impacts between rocky bodies, have been detected by the [Spitzer Space\nTelescope](/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope \"Spitzer Space Telescope\") around the\nnearby (29 [pc](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\") distant) young (~12 My old) star\n[HD172555](/wiki/HD172555 \"HD172555\") in the [Beta Pictoris moving\ngroup](/wiki/Beta_Pictoris_moving_group \"Beta Pictoris moving group\").[30] A\nbelt of warm dust in a zone between 0.25AU and 2AU from the young star [HD\n23514](/wiki/HD_23514 \"HD 23514\") in the [Pleiades](/wiki/Pleiades \"Pleiades\")\ncluster appears similar to the predicted results of Theia's collision with the\nembryonic Earth, and has been interpreted as the result of planet-sized\nobjects colliding with each other.[31] A similar belt of warm dust was\ndetected around the star [BD +20°307](/wiki/BD_%2B20%C2%B0307 \"BD +20°307\")\n(HIP 8920, SAO 75016).[32]\n\n## Difficulties[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Difficulties\")]\n\nThis lunar origin hypothesis has some difficulties that have yet to be\nresolved. For example, the giant-impact hypothesis implies that a surface\nmagma ocean would have formed following the impact. Yet there is no evidence\nthat the Earth ever had such a magma ocean and it is likely there exists\nmaterial that has never been processed in a magma ocean.[33]\n\n### Composition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\nA number of compositional inconsistencies need to be addressed.\n\n  * The ratios of the Moon's volatile elements are not explained by the giant-impact hypothesis. If the giant-impact hypothesis is correct, they must be due to some other cause.[33]\n  * The presence of volatiles such as water trapped in lunar [basalts](/wiki/Basalt \"Basalt\") is more difficult to explain if the Moon was caused by a high-temperature impact.[34]\n  * The iron oxide (FeO) content (13%) of the Moon, intermediate between that of Mars (18%) and the terrestrial mantle (8%), rules out most of the source of the proto-lunar material from the Earth's mantle.[35]\n  * If the bulk of the proto-lunar material had come from an impactor, the Moon should be enriched in [siderophilic](/wiki/Siderophile_element \"Siderophile element\") elements, when, in fact, it is deficient in those.[36]\n  * The Moon's oxygen isotopic ratios are essentially identical to those of Earth.[6] Oxygen isotopic ratios, which may be measured very precisely, yield a unique and distinct signature for each solar system body.[37] If a separate proto-planet [Theia](/wiki/Theia \"Theia\") had existed, it probably would have had a different oxygen isotopic signature than Earth, as would the ejected mixed material.[38]\n  * The Moon's [titanium isotope](/wiki/Titanium_isotope \"Titanium isotope\") ratio (50Ti/47Ti) appears so close to the Earth's (within 4 ppm), that little if any of the colliding body's mass could likely have been part of the Moon.[39][40]\n\n### Lack of a Venusian moon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Lack of a Venusian\nmoon\")]\n\nIf the Moon was formed by such an impact, it is possible that other inner\nplanets also may have been subjected to comparable impacts. A moon that formed\naround Venus by this process would have been unlikely to escape. If such a\nmoon-forming event had occurred there, a possible explanation of why the\nplanet does not have such a moon might be that a second collision occurred\nthat countered the [angular momentum](/wiki/Angular_momentum \"Angular\nmomentum\") from the first impact.[41] Another possibility is that the strong\ntidal forces from the Sun would tend to destabilize the orbits of moons around\nclose-in planets. For this reason, if Venus's slow rotation rate began early\nin its history, any satellites larger than a few kilometres in diameter would\nlikely have spiralled inwards and collided with Venus.[42]\n\nSimulations of the chaotic period of terrestrial planet formation suggest that\nimpacts like those hypothesized to have formed the Moon were common. For\ntypical terrestrial planets with a mass of 0.5 to 1 Earth masses, such an\nimpact typically results in a single moon containing 4% of the host planet's\nmass. The inclination of the resulting moon's orbit is random, but this tilt\naffects the subsequent dynamic evolution of the system. For example, some\norbits may cause the moon to spiral back into the planet. Likewise, the\nproximity of the planet to the star will also affect the orbital evolution.\nThe net effect is that it is more likely for impact-generated moons to survive\nwhen they orbit more distant terrestrial planets and are aligned with the\nplanetary orbit.[43]\n\n## Possible origin of Theia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Possible origin of\nTheia\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/BigSplashEnglish.svg/220px-\nBigSplashEnglish.svg.png)](/wiki/File:BigSplashEnglish.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:BigSplashEnglish.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOne suggested pathway for the Big Splash as viewed from the direction of the\nsouth pole\n\nIn 2004, [Princeton University](/wiki/Princeton_University \"Princeton\nUniversity\") mathematician [Edward Belbruno](/wiki/Edward_Belbruno \"Edward\nBelbruno\") and astrophysicist [J. Richard Gott III](/wiki/J._Richard_Gott_III\n\"J. Richard Gott III\") proposed that Theia coalesced at the\n[L4](/wiki/Lagrangian_point#L4_and_L5 \"Lagrangian point\") or\n[L5](/wiki/Lagrangian_point#L4_and_L5 \"Lagrangian point\") [Lagrangian\npoint](/wiki/Lagrangian_point \"Lagrangian point\") relative to Earth (in about\nthe same orbit and about 60° ahead or behind),[44][45] similar to a [trojan\nasteroid](/wiki/Trojan_asteroid \"Trojan asteroid\").[5] Two-dimensional\ncomputer models suggest that the stability of Theia's proposed [trojan\norbit](/wiki/Trojan_\\(astronomy\\) \"Trojan \\(astronomy\\)\") would have been\naffected when its growing mass exceeded a threshold of approximately 10% of\nthe Earth's mass (the mass of Mars).[44] In this scenario, gravitational\nperturbations by [planetesimals](/wiki/Planetesimal \"Planetesimal\") caused\nTheia to depart from its stable Lagrangian location, and subsequent\ninteractions with proto-Earth led to a collision between the two bodies.[44]\n\nIn 2008, evidence was presented that suggests that the collision may have\noccurred later than the accepted value of 4.53 [Gya](/wiki/Gya \"Gya\"), at\napproximately 4.48 Gya.[46] A 2014 comparison of computer simulations with\nelemental abundance measurements in the Earth's mantle indicated that the\ncollision occurred approximately 95 My after the formation of the Solar\nSystem.[47]\n\nIt has been suggested that other significant objects may have been created by\nthe impact, which could have remained in orbit between the Earth and Moon,\nstuck in Lagrangian points. Such objects may have stayed within the Earth–Moon\nsystem for as long as 100 million years, until the gravitational tugs of other\nplanets destabilized the system enough to free the objects.[48] A study\npublished in 2011 suggested that a subsequent collision between the Moon and\none of these smaller bodies caused the notable differences in physical\ncharacteristics between the two hemispheres of the Moon.[49] This collision,\nsimulations have supported, would have been at a low enough velocity so as not\nto form a crater; instead, the material from the smaller body would have\nspread out across the Moon (in what would become its [far\nside](/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon \"Far side of the Moon\")), adding a thick\nlayer of highlands crust.[50] The resulting mass irregularities would\nsubsequently produce a gravity gradient that resulted in [tidal\nlocking](/wiki/Tidal_locking \"Tidal locking\") of the Moon so that today, only\nthe near side remains visible from Earth. However, mapping by the\n[GRAIL](/wiki/Gravity_Recovery_and_Interior_Laboratory \"Gravity Recovery and\nInterior Laboratory\") mission has apparently ruled out this\nscenario.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Modified hypothesis[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Modified hypothesis\")]\n\nThe giant-impact hypothesis fails to properly explain the similar composition\nof Earth and the Moon. Especially, the indistinguishable relation of oxygen\nisotopes cannot be explained by the classical form of this hypothesis.\nAccording to research on the subject that is based on new simulations at the\n[University of Bern](/wiki/University_of_Bern \"University of Bern\") by\nphysicist Andreas Reufer and his colleagues, Theia collided directly with\nEarth instead of barely swiping it. The collision speed may have been higher\nthan originally assumed, and this higher velocity may have totally destroyed\nTheia. According to this modification, the composition of Theia is not so\nrestricted, making a composition of up to 50% water ice possible.[51]\n\n## Alternative hypotheses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Alternative\nhypotheses\")]\n\nMain article: [Origin of the Moon](/wiki/Origin_of_the_Moon \"Origin of the\nMoon\")\n\nOther mechanisms that have been suggested at various times for the Moon's\norigin are that the Moon was spun off from the Earth's molten surface by\n[centrifugal force](/wiki/Centrifugal_force \"Centrifugal force\");[9] that it\nwas formed elsewhere and was subsequently [captured](/wiki/Lunar_capture\n\"Lunar capture\") by the Earth's gravitational field;[52] or that the Earth and\nthe Moon formed at the same time and place from the same [accretion\ndisk](/wiki/Accretion_disk \"Accretion disk\"). None of these hypotheses can\naccount for the high [angular momentum](/wiki/Angular_momentum \"Angular\nmomentum\") of the Earth–Moon system.[18]\n\nAnother hypothesis attributes the formation of the Moon to the impact of a\nlarge asteroid with the Earth much later than previously thought, creating the\nsatellite primarily from debris from Earth. In this hypothesis, the formation\nof the Moon occurs 60–140 million years after the formation of the Solar\nSystem. Previously, the age of the Moon had been thought to be 4.527 ± 0.010\nbillion years.[53] The impact in this scenario would have created a magma\nocean on Earth and the proto-Moon with both bodies sharing a common plasma\nmetal vapour atmosphere. The shared metal vapour bridge would have allowed\nmaterial from the Earth and proto-Moon to exchange and equilibrate into a more\ncommon composition.[54][55]\n\nYet another hypothesis proposes that the Moon and the Earth have formed\ntogether instead of separately like the giant-impact hypothesis suggests. The\nnew model, developed by [Robin M. Canup](/wiki/Robin_M._Canup \"Robin M.\nCanup\"), suggests that the Moon and the Earth have formed as a part of a\nmassive collision of two planetary bodies, each larger than Mars, which then\nre-collided to form what we now call Earth. After the recollision, Earth was\nsurrounded by a disk of material, which accreted to form the Moon. This\nhypothesis could explain facts that others do not.[56]\n\nMoon – [Oceanus Procellarum](/wiki/Oceanus_Procellarum \"Oceanus Procellarum\")\n(\"Ocean of Storms\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/14-236-LunarGrailMission-\nOceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg/389px-14-236-LunarGrailMission-\nOceanusProcellarum-Rifts-\nOverall-20141001.jpg)](/wiki/File:14-236-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-\nRifts-Overall-20141001.jpg)\n\nAncient [rift valleys](/wiki/Rift_valley \"Rift valley\") – rectangular\nstructure (visible – topography – [GRAIL gravity\ngradients](/wiki/Gravity_Recovery_and_Interior_Laboratory \"Gravity Recovery\nand Interior Laboratory\")) (October 1, 2014).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/PIA18822-LunarGrailMission-\nOceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg/144px-\nPIA18822-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-\nOverall-20141001.jpg)](/wiki/File:PIA18822-LunarGrailMission-\nOceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg)\n\nAncient [rift valleys](/wiki/Rift_valley \"Rift valley\") – context.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/PIA18821-LunarGrailMission-\nOceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Closeup-20141001.jpg/247px-\nPIA18821-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-\nCloseup-20141001.jpg)](/wiki/File:PIA18821-LunarGrailMission-\nOceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Closeup-20141001.jpg)\n\nAncient [rift valleys](/wiki/Rift_valley \"Rift valley\") – closeup (artist's\nconcept).\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Crab_Nebula.jpg/28px-Crab_Nebula.jpg)[Astronomy portal](/wiki/Portal:Astronomy \"Portal:Astronomy\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Earth-moon.jpg/32px-Earth-moon.jpg)[Space portal](/wiki/Portal:Space \"Portal:Space\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg/28px-Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg)](/wiki/File:Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg)[Moon portal](/wiki/Portal:Moon \"Portal:Moon\")\n\n  * [Geologic time scale](/wiki/Geologic_time_scale \"Geologic time scale\")\n  * [Geology of the Moon](/wiki/Geology_of_the_Moon \"Geology of the Moon\")\n  * [History of Earth](/wiki/History_of_Earth \"History of Earth\")\n  * [Lunar geologic timescale](/wiki/Lunar_geologic_timescale \"Lunar geologic timescale\")\n  * [Origin of the Moon](/wiki/Origin_of_the_Moon \"Origin of the Moon\")\n  * [Roche limit](/wiki/Roche_limit \"Roche limit\")\n  * [Theia (planet)](/wiki/Theia_\\(planet\\) \"Theia \\(planet\\)\")\n  * [Nibiru (Babylonian astronomy)](/wiki/Nibiru_\\(Babylonian_astronomy\\) \"Nibiru \\(Babylonian astronomy\\)\")\n  * [Phaeton (hypothetical planet)](/wiki/Phaeton_\\(hypothetical_planet\\) \"Phaeton \\(hypothetical planet\\)\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n### Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Giant-\nimpact_hypothesis&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Revisiting the Moon\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/revisiting-the-moon.html). _The New York Times_. 2014-09-09.\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Halliday, Alex N.
