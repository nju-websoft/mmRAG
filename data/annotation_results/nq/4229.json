The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a\n[cotranslational](/wiki/Translation_\\(genetics\\) \"Translation \\(genetics\\)\")\nor [posttranslational modification](/wiki/Posttranslational_modification\n\"Posttranslational modification\"). This process is known as\n[glycosylation](/wiki/Glycosylation \"Glycosylation\"). [Secreted extracellular\nproteins](/wiki/Secretory_protein \"Secretory protein\") are often glycosylated.\n\nIn proteins that have segments extending extracellularly, the extracellular\nsegments are also often glycosylated. Glycoproteins are also often important\n[integral membrane proteins](/wiki/Integral_membrane_proteins \"Integral\nmembrane proteins\"), where they play a role in cell–cell interactions. It is\nimportant[_[according to\nwhom?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] to distinguish endoplasmic\nreticulum-based glycosylation of the secretory system from reversible\ncytosolic-nuclear glycosylation. Glycoproteins of the [cytosol](/wiki/Cytosol\n\"Cytosol\") and nucleus can be modified through the reversible addition of a\nsingle GlcNAc residue that is considered reciprocal to phosphorylation and the\nfunctions of these are likely to be additional regulatory mechanism that\ncontrols phosphorylation-based signalling.[2] In contrast, classical secretory\nglycosylation can be structurally essential. For example, inhibition of\nasparagine-linked, i.e. N-linked, glycosylation can prevent proper\nglycoprotein folding and full inhibition can be toxic to an individual cell.\nIn contrast, perturbation of glycan processing (enzymatic removal/addition of\ncarbohydrate residues to the glycan), which occurs in both the [endoplastic\nreticulum](/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum \"Endoplasmic reticulum\") and [Golgi\napparatus](/wiki/Golgi_apparatus \"Golgi apparatus\"), is dispensable for\nisolated cells (as evidence by survival with glycosides inhibitors) but can\nlead to human disease (congenital disorders of glycosylation) and can be\nlethal in animal models. It is therefore likely that the fine processing of\nglycans is important for endogenous functionality, such as cell trafficking,\nbut that this is likely to have been secondary to its role in host-pathogen\ninteractions. A famous example of this latter effect is the [ABO blood group\nsystem](/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system \"ABO blood group system\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Types of glycosylation\n  * 2 Monosaccharides\n  * 3 Examples\n  * 4 Hormones\n  * 5 Functions\n  * 6 Analysis\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes and references\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Types of\nglycosylation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Glycoprotein&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Types of glycosylation\")]\n\nThere are several types of glycosylation, although the first two are the most\ncommon.\n\n  * In [N-glycosylation](/wiki/N-linked_glycosylation \"N-linked glycosylation\"), sugars are attached to nitrogen, typically on the [amide](/wiki/Amide \"Amide\") side-chain of [asparagine](/wiki/Asparagine \"Asparagine\").\n  * In [O-glycosylation](/wiki/O-linked_glycosylation \"O-linked glycosylation\"), sugars are attached to oxygen, typically on [serine](/wiki/Serine \"Serine\") or [threonine](/wiki/Threonine \"Threonine\"), but also on [tyrosine](/wiki/Tyrosine \"Tyrosine\") or non-canonical amino acids such as [hydroxylysine](/wiki/Hydroxylysine \"Hydroxylysine\") & [hydroxyproline](/wiki/Hydroxyproline \"Hydroxyproline\").\n  * In [P-glycosylation](/w/index.php?title=P-linked_glycosylation&action=edit&redlink=1 \"P-linked glycosylation \\(page does not exist\\)\"), sugars are attached to [phosphorus](/wiki/Phosphorous_acid \"Phosphorous acid\") on a [phosphoserine](/wiki/Phosphoserine \"Phosphoserine\").\n  * In [C-glycosylation](/w/index.php?title=C-linked_glycosylation&action=edit&redlink=1 \"C-linked glycosylation \\(page does not exist\\)\"), sugars are attached directly to carbon, such as in the addition of [mannose](/wiki/Mannose \"Mannose\") to [tryptophan](/wiki/Tryptophan \"Tryptophan\").\n  * In [S-glycosylation](/w/index.php?title=S-linked_glycosylation&action=edit&redlink=1 \"S-linked glycosylation \\(page does not exist\\)\"), a beta-[GlcNAc](/wiki/GlcNAc \"GlcNAc\") is attached to the sulfur atom of a [cysteine](/wiki/Cysteine \"Cysteine\") residue[3].\n  * In [glypiation](/wiki/Glypiation \"Glypiation\"), a [GPI](/wiki/Glycophosphatidylinositol \"Glycophosphatidylinositol\") glycolipid is attached to the C-terminus of a polypeptide, serving as a membrane anchor.\n  * In [glycation](/wiki/Glycation \"Glycation\"), also known as non-enzymatic glycosylation, sugars are covalently bonded to a protein or lipid molecule, without the controlling action of an enzyme, but through a [Maillard reaction](/wiki/Maillard_reaction \"Maillard reaction\").\n\n##\nMonosaccharides[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Glycoprotein&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Monosaccharides\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Glykoproteine_Zucker.svg/220px-\nGlykoproteine_Zucker.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Glykoproteine_Zucker.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Glykoproteine_Zucker.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nEight sugars commonly found in glycoproteins.\n\nMonosaccharides commonly found in eukaryotic glycoproteins include:[4]:526\n\nThe principal sugars found in human glycoproteins[5] Sugar  | Type  | Abbreviation   \n---|---|---  \n[β-D-Glucose](/wiki/Glucose \"Glucose\") | [Hexose](/wiki/Hexose \"Hexose\") | Glc   \n[β-D-Galactose](/wiki/Galactose \"Galactose\") | Hexose  | Gal   \n[β-D-Mannose](/wiki/Mannose \"Mannose\") | Hexose  | Man   \n[α-L-Fucose](/wiki/Fucose \"Fucose\") | [Deoxyhexose](/wiki/Deoxy_sugar \"Deoxy sugar\") | Fuc   \n[N-Acetylgalactosamine](/wiki/N-Acetylgalactosamine \"N-Acetylgalactosamine\") | [Aminohexose](/wiki/Aminosugar \"Aminosugar\") | GalNAc   \n[N-Acetylglucosamine](/wiki/N-Acetylglucosamine \"N-Acetylglucosamine\") | Aminohexose  | GlcNAc   \n[N-Acetylneuraminic acid](/wiki/N-Acetylneuraminic_acid \"N-Acetylneuraminic acid\") | [Aminononulosonic acid](/wiki/Neuraminic_acid \"Neuraminic acid\")  \n([Sialic acid](/wiki/Sialic_acid \"Sialic acid\"))  | NeuNAc   \n[Xylose](/wiki/Xylose \"Xylose\") | [Pentose](/wiki/Pentose \"Pentose\") | Xyl   \n  \nThe sugar group(s) can assist in [protein folding](/wiki/Protein_folding\n\"Protein folding\"), improve proteins' stability and are involved in cell\nsignalling.\n\n## Examples[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Glycoprotein&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Examples\")]\n\nOne example of glycoproteins found in the body is [mucins](/wiki/Mucin\n\"Mucin\"), which are secreted in the mucus of the respiratory and digestive\ntracts.

Over time, some patients can evolve\nantibodies to recognise the HIV glycans and almost all so-called 'broadly\nneutralising antibodies (bnAbs) recognise some glycans. This is possible\nmainly because the unusually high density of glycans hinders normal glycan\nmaturation and they are therefore trapped in the premature, high-mannose,\nstate.[8][9] This provides a window for immune recognition. In addition, as\nthese glycans are much less variable than the underlying protein, they have\nemerged as promising targets for vaccine design.[10]\n\n##
