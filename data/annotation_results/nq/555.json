Foley announced that former [Washington\nCapitals](/wiki/Washington_Capitals \"Washington Capitals\") general manager\n[George McPhee](/wiki/George_McPhee \"George McPhee\") would be the franchise's\nfirst general manager.[21] On November 22, 2016, the name was revealed as the\nVegas Golden Knights.\n\n### Start of operations:\n2017–present[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vegas_Golden_Knights&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Start of operations: 2017–present\")]\n\nOn March 1, 2017 (coinciding with the league's trade deadline), the team\ncompleted its expansion fee payments and filings, making it eligible to\nformally begin operations such as free agent acquisition, and participation in\nleague meetings.[22] Five days later, the Golden Knights made their first\npersonnel move by signing [Reid Duke](/wiki/Reid_Duke_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"Reid\nDuke \\(ice hockey\\)\") to a three-year entry-level contract.[23][24]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Gerard_Gallant_2018-02-04_2.jpg/220px-\nGerard_Gallant_2018-02-04_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gerard_Gallant_2018-02-04_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gerard_Gallant_2018-02-04_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Gerard Gallant](/wiki/Gerard_Gallant \"Gerard Gallant\") coaching the Golden\nKnights during their inaugural [2017–18](/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_NHL_season\n\"2017–18 NHL season\") season.

The draft\npicks were announced at T-Mobile Arena during the [NHL\nAwards](/wiki/NHL_Awards \"NHL Awards\") ceremony. Some notable selections\nincluded goalie [Marc-Andre Fleury](/wiki/Marc-Andr%C3%A9_Fleury \"Marc-André\nFleury\") from the [Pittsburgh Penguins](/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh\nPenguins\") and winger [James Neal](/wiki/James_Neal_\\(ice_hockey\\) \"James Neal\n\\(ice hockey\\)\") from the [Nashville Predators](/wiki/Nashville_Predators\n\"Nashville Predators\").

The Golden Knights played their first game on October 6\nagainst the [Dallas Stars](/wiki/Dallas_Stars \"Dallas Stars\") with Neal\nscoring the franchise's first two goals en route to their first victory.[28]\n\nThe team's inaugural home game was played on October 10, 2017, hosting the\n[Arizona Coyotes](/wiki/Arizona_Coyotes \"Arizona Coyotes\") as the second game\nof a home-and-home series. In the aftermath of the [October 1 mass\nshooting](/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting \"2017 Las Vegas shooting\"), the pre-\ngame ceremonies honored the victims of the attack, and the team issued an\nappeal for donations to its charitable arm.[29] With their 5–2 win, the Golden\nKnights increased their unbeaten streak to start the season to 3–0, an NHL\nrecord for an expansion team.[30][31][32] The Golden Knights are the first\nteam in NHL history to have started their inaugural season winning eight of\ntheir first nine games. During their tenth game, goaltender [Oscar\nDansk](/wiki/Oscar_Dansk \"Oscar Dansk\") was injured becoming the third Golden\nKnights' goaltender to be injured during the season after losing starters\nFleury and the recently acquired [Malcolm Subban](/wiki/Malcolm_Subban\n\"Malcolm Subban\"), forcing the team to start a fourth goaltender in 11 games\nwith [Maxime Lagace](/wiki/Maxime_Lagac%C3%A9 \"Maxime Lagacé\").[33] Fifteen\ngames into the season, [Vadim Shipachyov](/wiki/Vadim_Shipachyov \"Vadim\nShipachyov\") became the first player to retire from the NHL as a Golden Knight\nwhen he decided to return to the [Kontinental Hockey\nLeague](/wiki/Kontinental_Hockey_League \"Kontinental Hockey League\"). In\nDecember, the Golden Knights set another NHL expansion team record of six\nstraight wins, a record they had previously missed when they lost their tenth\ngame of the season, and established a new NHL record with eight straight\nwins.[34][35][36] On February 1, 2018, the Golden Knights set the expansion\nteam record for wins in a debut season with 34 wins after only 50 games,[37]\nand then on February 21, 2018, set a record for most points by an expansion\nteam in the inaugural season with 84.[38] On March 26, the Golden Knights\nbecame the first team since the [Edmonton Oilers](/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers\n\"Edmonton Oilers\") and [Hartford Whalers](/wiki/Hartford_Whalers \"Hartford\nWhalers\") in the [1979–80 season](/wiki/1979%E2%80%9380_NHL_season \"1979–80\nNHL season\") to make the playoffs in their inaugural season in the league.[39]\nOn March 31, the Knights clinched the Pacific Division title, becoming the\nfirst true expansion team in the [four major\nsports](/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada\n\"Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada\") to win\nits division in its inaugural season (not counting all-expansion divisions, as\nwas the case in the [1967–68 season](/wiki/1967%E2%80%9368_NHL_season \"1967–68\nNHL season\")).[40] They had led the Pacific since December 23.\n\nOn April 11, the franchise won its first playoff game in a [1–0\nvictory](/wiki/2018_Stanley_Cup_playoffs#\\(P1\\)_Vegas_Golden_Knights_vs._\\(WC1\\)_Los_Angeles_Kings\n\"2018 Stanley Cup playoffs\") over the [Los Angeles\nKings](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings \"Los Angeles Kings\") in the first game of the\nseries. Six days later on April 17, the franchise earned their first playoff\nseries win against the Kings, winning the fourth game by a 1–0 score, which\nalso became their first playoff series sweep. The Knights became the first\nteam in NHL history to sweep their first playoff series in their inaugural\nseason.[41] On May 6, 2018, the Golden Knights defeated the [San Jose\nSharks](/wiki/San_Jose_Sharks \"San Jose Sharks\") four-games-to-two, becoming\nthe third team in NHL history to win multiple playoff series in their\ninaugural season, and advanced to the Western Conference Finals.[42] On May\n20, Vegas defeated the [Winnipeg Jets](/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets \"Winnipeg Jets\") to\nwin the Western Conference Finals in five games, becoming the third NHL team\nto advance to the [Stanley Cup Finals](/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals \"Stanley Cup\nFinals\") in its inaugural season, after the [Toronto\nArenas](/wiki/Toronto_Arenas \"Toronto Arenas\") in\n[1918](/wiki/1918_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"1918 Stanley Cup Finals\") and the [St.\nLouis Blues](/wiki/St._Louis_Blues \"St. Louis Blues\") in\n[1968](/wiki/1968_Stanley_Cup_Finals \"1968 Stanley Cup Finals\").[43]\n\n## Team\nidentity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vegas_Golden_Knights&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Team identity\")]\n\n### Logos, colors, and\nuniforms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vegas_Golden_Knights&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Logos, colors, and uniforms\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/26/Vegas_Golden_Knights_secondary_logo.png/130px-\nVegas_Golden_Knights_secondary_logo.png)](/wiki/File:Vegas_Golden_Knights_secondary_logo.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Vegas_Golden_Knights_secondary_logo.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe team's secondary logo\n\nThe team's primary logo is a [barbute](/wiki/Barbute \"Barbute\") helmet,\nsuperimposed on a black and gold seal, with a V-shaped opening.[44][45] The\nsecondary logo is two crossing swords behind a red star, designed to resemble\na star found on the landmark [Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\nsign](/wiki/Welcome_to_Fabulous_Las_Vegas_sign \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\nsign\").[45]\n\nThe team's primary color is [steel gray](/wiki/Steel_gray \"Steel gray\"), which\nis said to represent \"strength and durability\".[45][1] The other team colors\nare [gold](/wiki/Gold_\\(color\\) \"Gold \\(color\\)\"), [red](/wiki/Red \"Red\")\n(found in the Las Vegas skyline and at [Red Rock\nCanyon](/wiki/Red_Rock_Canyon_National_Conservation_Area \"Red Rock Canyon\nNational Conservation Area\")), and [black](/wiki/Black \"Black\") (for \"power\nand intensity\").[1]\n\nThe first uniforms in Golden Knights team history were unveiled publicly on\nJune 20, 2017.[46]\n\n### Name[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Vegas_Golden_Knights&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Name\")]\n\nThe team's name includes \"Knights\" as a homage to the [Black\nKnights](/wiki/Army_Black_Knights \"Army Black Knights\") of the [United States\nMilitary Academy](/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy \"United States Military\nAcademy\"), Foley's alma mater, and because [knights](/wiki/Knights \"Knights\")\nwere, according to Foley, \"the epitome of the warrior class\".[44][47] Foley\nhad hoped to name his team the Black Knights, but dropped that plan after\nencountering resistance from federal officials.
