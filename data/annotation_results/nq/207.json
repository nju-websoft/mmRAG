Nostril piercing is also part of traditional\n[Australian Aboriginal](/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal \"Australian Aboriginal\")\nculture.[1] and the culture of the Ilocano, a Muslim tribe in the Philippines.\nWith the diffusion, exposure and spread of Indian fashion and culture, nostril\npiercing has in recent decades become popular in the wider world, as have\nother forms of body piercing, after [punks](/wiki/Punk_subculture \"Punk\nsubculture\") and subsequent youth cultures in the '80s and '90s adopted this\nsort of piercing. Today, nostril piercing is popular in the wider world\nincluding South America, United States of America, Canada, the Caribbean,\nAustralia, Africa, Japan and Europe, with piercings being performed on either\nthe left or right nostril.\n\nHistorically in the [Indian Subcontinent](/wiki/Indian_Subcontinent \"Indian\nSubcontinent\"), nose piercings are done by women only. However the spread of\nthis fashion has resulted in both men and women having nostril piercings in\nthe wider world. Several different types of nostril rings are found. Among the\nmost popular are the loop, the stud with an L-bar closure, the stud with a\nball closure, and the stud with a flat backing.\n\nIn India the outside of the left part of the body [?] is the preferred\nposition of the piercing. This is followed by some orthodox folk also because\n[Ayurvedic medicine](/wiki/Ayurveda \"Ayurveda\") associates this location with\nthe female reproductive organs.[2] In India, like any other jewelry, piercings\nand the jewelry are regarded as a mark of beauty and social standing as well\nas a Hindu's honor to [Parvati](/wiki/Parvati \"Parvati\"), the goddess of\nmarriage. Nose piercing is still popular in India and the subcontinent. The\npiercings are often an integral part of [Indian wedding](/wiki/Indian_wedding\n\"Indian wedding\") jewelry. In [Maharashtra](/wiki/Maharashtra \"Maharashtra\")\nwomen wear very large intricate nose pieces that often cover the mouth or the\nside of the face.\n\nIt is very common in [Bengali](/wiki/Bengali_people \"Bengali people\") women.\n[Pashtun](/wiki/Pashtun_people \"Pashtun people\") and\n[Pahari](/wiki/Pahari_people \"Pahari people\") women commonly have both\nnostrils pierced. Many South Indian [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_people \"Tamil people\")\nalso follow this old tradition. Numerous traditions are associated with it.\nMany women from the Asian subcontinent are cremated with just their nose studs\nas jewelry is removed before the funeral. Indian widows usually remove their\nnose studs as a sign of respect. Nose piercing has historically been strictly\nforbidden among many families of [Kashmiris](/wiki/Kashmiri_people \"Kashmiri\npeople\") belonging to Butt, Dar, Lone and Mir castes settled in Pakistan as\ntheir ancestors associated nose piercing with people of menial descent in\nancient Kashmiri society.\n\n## Septum\npiercing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nose_piercing&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Septum piercing\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Septum_piercing.jpg/170px-\nSeptum_piercing.jpg)](/wiki/File:Septum_piercing.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Septum_piercing.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLarge-[gauge](/wiki/American_wire_gauge \"American wire gauge\") septum piercing\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/FulaniWoman.jpg/170px-\nFulaniWoman.jpg)](/wiki/File:FulaniWoman.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:FulaniWoman.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFulani woman with traditional nose ring and mouth tattoo\n\nThe [nasal septum](/wiki/Nasal_septum \"Nasal septum\") is the\n[cartilaginous](/wiki/Cartilaginous \"Cartilaginous\") dividing wall between the\nnostrils. Generally, the cartilage itself is not pierced, but rather the small\ngap between the cartilage and the bottom of the nose (sometimes called the\n\"sweet spot\"), typically at 14ga (1.6 mm) although it is often stretched to a\nlarger gauge (size). The nose has many nerves running through it, and as a\nresult, nose piercings can be painful, although the pain varies by individual.\nThis piercing heals within a month and a half to three months also depending\non the individual. It should only be stretched by 1mm at a time, and waiting\nat least a month between stretches is advisable.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] If a\ncertain point is exceeded, usually about 8mm, the cartilage gets forced\ntowards the top of the nose, which can be uncomfortable.\n\nMany types of jewelry generally are worn in a septum piercing, such as:\n[Captive bead rings](/wiki/Captive_bead_ring \"Captive bead ring\") (CBRs),\nrings that close with a bead held in the center by the tension of the ring,\ncircular barbells (as shown in the picture), a circular bar with a bead that\nscrews onto either end, a \"tusk\" that is a straight or shaped piece of\nmaterial generally tapered on either end, or pinchers. For large gauge\nseptums, many individuals choose to wear plugs, as the plugs do not weigh\ntheir noses down, which is helpful in healing. This measure allows the\npiercing not to be damaged by the sudden movement of the jewelry.\n\nAnother option is a septum retainer, which is staple-shaped. This type of nose\npiercing is particularly easy to hide when desired, for example to comply with\na dress code. A septum retainer makes possible turning the jewelry up into the\nnose, thus concealing it. With black jewelry flipped up into the nostrils,\nthis piercing can be made practically invisible. A circular barbell can also\nbe hidden by pushing it to the back into the nose, but it may be\nuncomfortable.\n\nSeptum piercing is a popular trend among South Indian dancers\n([Kuchipudi](/wiki/Kuchipudi \"Kuchipudi\"), [Bharatnatyam](/wiki/Bharatnatyam\n\"Bharatnatyam\")) and among certain Native American peoples in history; the\n[Shawnee](/wiki/Shawnee \"Shawnee\") leaders [Tecumseh](/wiki/Tecumseh\n\"Tecumseh\") and [Tenskwatawa](/wiki/Tenskwatawa \"Tenskwatawa\"), for example,\nhad such piercings.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe septum piercing is popular in countrysides of India, Nepal, and\n[Bangladesh](/wiki/Bangladesh \"Bangladesh\"). In India such piercing is called\nthe 'Nathori' and popular with the Banjara ethnic groups and Adivasi tribes.\nLord Krishna and his consort Radharani are often depicted wearing the\n'Nathori' style jewel nose pieces.[3]\n\nBengali women traditionally would wear the nathori as a sign of being a\nmarried woman. The nathori would be gold with a tear drop that would move\nalong the ring. Many lower-class women in rural Bengal still keep this\ntradition. This practice is now declining as many women prefer the nose studs.\n\nIn southern Nepal the septum piercing is still common. Many older women still\nadorn their noses with both the septum and left nostril rings. Many women have\ngold nose piercings to show their social, tribal, and religious status in\nsociety.\n\n### Risks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nose_piercing&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Risks\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This article **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

The cartilage is, however, usually not pierced. It is the thin strip\nof very soft and flexible skin, just between the cartilage and the bottom of\nthe nose, where septum piercing is mostly done. Piercing the skin instead of\nthe cartilage can greatly minimize the pain, as well as other discomforts\nassociated with this type of body piercing. This piercing should be done only\nwith a needle. As far as jewelry is concerned, captive bead rings, circular\nbarbells, plugs, tusks, curls, and septum retainer can be used.\n\nAll types of body piercings, including septum piercing, are associated with\nthe risk of contracting certain blood borne diseases, like hepatitis, from the\nneedles and piercing guns used in the procedure. This risk can be reduced by\ngetting the piercing done by a reputed piercer and making sure that the\npiercer uses only sterile single-use needles. The next common risk associated\nwith almost all types of piercing is the risk of infection and pain. These\nissues can be minimized greatly if piercing is done on the soft and flexible\nskin that lies between the cartilage and bottom of the nose. As far as\ninfection risks are concerned, they can be managed with proper piercing\naftercare.\n\nThis piercing can sometimes lead to 'septal hematoma' \\-- an injury to the\nsoft tissue within the septum that can disrupt the blood vessels to cause the\naccumulation of blood and fluid under the lining. Nasal septum hematoma can\neventually cause nasal congestion and interfere with breathing along with\ncausing pain and inflammation. If not treated immediately, the condition can\nultimately cause formation of a hole in the septum, leading to nasal\ncongestion. Sometimes, that part of the nose may collapse, resulting in a\ncosmetic deformity, known as '[saddle nose](/wiki/Saddle_nose \"Saddle\nnose\")'.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Bridge\npiercing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nose_piercing&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Bridge piercing\")]\n\nMain article: [Bridge piercing](/wiki/Bridge_piercing \"Bridge piercing\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Erl-\npiercing.jpg/220px-Erl-piercing.jpg)](/wiki/File:Erl-piercing.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Erl-piercing.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBridge piercing\n\n[Bridge piercings](/wiki/Bridge_piercing \"Bridge piercing\") are inserted\nthrough the skin at the top of the nose, between the eyes. Curved barbells and\nstraight barbells are the most commonly used in this piercing, while seamless\nrings are less common.\n\n## Social acceptability of nose\npiercing[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nose_piercing&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Social acceptability of nose piercing\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This section **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.
