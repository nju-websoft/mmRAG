The film was nominated for an [Academy\nAward](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\") for [Best Visual\nEffects](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Visual_Effects \"Academy Award for Best\nVisual Effects\").

But then, during Will's presentation for the drug, Bright Eyes\nis forced from her cage, goes on a rampage, and is shot to death. Will's boss\nSteven Jacobs terminates the project and has the chimps slaughtered. However,\nWill's assistant Robert Franklin discovers that the reason for Bright Eyes'\nrampage was that she had recently given birth to an infant chimp. Will\nreluctantly agrees to take in the chimp, who is named Caesar. Will learns that\nCaesar has inherited his mother's intelligence and decides to raise him. Three\nyears later, Will introduces Caesar to the [redwood](/wiki/Redwood \"Redwood\")\nforest at [Muir Woods National Monument](/wiki/Muir_Woods_National_Monument\n\"Muir Woods National Monument\"). Meanwhile, Will treats his\n[dementia](/wiki/Dementia \"Dementia\")-suffering father Charles with ALZ-112,\nwhich seems to restore his cognitive ability.\n\nFive years later, when Caesar reaches adolescence and sees a dog on a leash\nlike his own, he questions his identity and learns of his origins from Will.\nMeanwhile, Charles's condition returns as he becomes resistant to ALZ-112.\nCaesar injures a neighbor, Douglas Hunsiker, while defending a confused\nCharles. As a result, he is placed in a primate shelter where he is tormented\nby a chimp named Rocket and the chief guard, Dodge Landon, but also where he\nbefriends an [orangutan](/wiki/Orangutan \"Orangutan\") named Maurice who came\nfrom a [circus](/wiki/Circus \"Circus\"). Caesar learns how to unlock his cage,\ngaining free access to the common area. With the assistance of a\n[gorilla](/wiki/Gorilla \"Gorilla\") named Buck, he confronts the sanctuary's\nalpha, Rocket and claims that position. Meanwhile, Jacobs clears development\nof a more powerful, gaseous version of the drug – ALZ-113 – when Will tells\nhim it can also improve intelligence. Will takes the drug home to try to save\nhis father, but Charles declines further treatment and dies overnight.\n\nAfter attempting to test the drug on a scarred [bonobo](/wiki/Bonobo \"Bonobo\")\ntest subject named Koba, Franklin becomes exposed to ALZ-113 and becomes ill.\nAttempting to warn Will at his home, he sneezes blood onto Hunsiker and is\nlater discovered dead. Will attempts to reclaim Caesar, but the chimp refuses\nto go home with him so he could look after the other apes. Instead, he escapes\nfrom the facility and returns to Will's house, where he takes canisters of the\nALZ-113. Upon returning, Caesar releases the gas and allows it to enhance the\nintelligence of the other apes. When Dodge attempts to get him back into his\ncage, Caesar speaks for the first time, yelling \"No!\" and gets in a fight\nwhich inadvertently leads to Dodge's death. The apes flee the facility,\nrelease the remaining chimps from Gen-Sys, and free more apes from the [San\nFrancisco Zoo](/wiki/San_Francisco_Zoo \"San Francisco Zoo\") on the way.\n\nA battle ensues as the ape army fights their way past a police blockade on the\n[Golden Gate Bridge](/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge \"Golden Gate Bridge\") to escape\ninto the redwood forest. Buck sacrifices himself to save Caesar by jumping\ninto the helicopter in which Jacobs is riding. The helicopter crashes onto the\nbridge, trapping Jacobs in the wreckage. Koba seizes his chance for revenge\nand sends Jacobs falling to his death in the bay below.\n\nAs the apes find their way into the forest, Will arrives and warns Caesar that\nthe humans will hunt them down, and begs him to return home. In response,\nCaesar hugs him and says that, \"Caesar is home.\" Will, realizing that this is\nindeed their last goodbye, respects Caesar's wishes. The apes embrace their\nnew lifestyle in the forest.\n\nIn a [mid-credits scene](/wiki/Post-credits_scene \"Post-credits scene\"), an\ninfected Hunsiker leaves his house for work as an airline pilot, arriving at\n[San Francisco International\nAirport](/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport \"San Francisco\nInternational Airport\") for his flight to [Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\"). His\nnose begins to drip [blood](/wiki/Blood \"Blood\") onto the floor.

As\nJaffa searched a newspaper articles [clipping](/wiki/Clipping_\\(publications\\)\n\"Clipping \\(publications\\)\"), one about [pet chimpanzees](/wiki/Pet_monkey\n\"Pet monkey\") that become troublesome to their owners and heartbroken for not\nadapting well to the human environment intrigued him. As Jaffa eventually\nrealized it fit the _Planet of the Apes_ series, he called his wife and\nscreenwriting partner Amanda Silver to express his ideas of such a chimpanzee\neventually starting the ape revolution, and then the couple started developing\nthe character of [Caesar](/wiki/Caesar_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\) \"Caesar \\(Planet\nof the Apes\\)\"). Jaffa indicated that \"it's a reinvention\" and if he had to\npick between calling it a prequel or a reboot he would say it is a reboot:\n\"It's a different story of who Caesar is, and how he came to be. So it's\nreally kind of hard to put a label on it. We are hopefully rebooting it.\" He\nwent on to say that \"we tried really hard to create a story that would stand\non its own and yet also pay homage and honor the movies that came before\nus.\"[9] Jaffa and Silver then wrote a script and sold it to Fox, producers of\nthe _Apes_ franchise. The script added other elements which the couple had\nresearched, such as genetic engineering.[10] Several tributes to specific\nscenes, characters, and cast and crew from the previous _Apes_ film series\nwere added in the script. In particular, Caesar's treatment at the primate\nsanctuary parallels [Taylor](/wiki/Taylor_\\(Planet_of_the_Apes\\)#Taylor\n\"Taylor \\(Planet of the Apes\\)\")'s treatment as a captive in the original\nfilm.[11][12]\n\nIn a segment of a video blog post, director [Rupert Wyatt](/wiki/Rupert_Wyatt\n\"Rupert Wyatt\") commented on the originality of the plot: \"This is part of the\nmythology and it should be seen as that. It's not a continuation of the other\nfilms; it's an original story. It does satisfy the people who enjoy those\nfilms. The point of this film is to achieve that and to bring that fan base\ninto this film exactly like _[Batman Begins](/wiki/Batman_Begins \"Batman\nBegins\")_.\"[6] In a 2009 interview, Wyatt said, \"We've incorporated elements\nfrom _[Conquest of the Planet of the\nApes](/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes \"Conquest of the Planet of the\nApes\")_ , in terms of how the apes begin to revolt, but this is primarily a\nprequel to the 1968 film...Caesar is a revolutionary figure who will be talked\nabout by his fellow apes for centuries...This is just the first step in the\nevolution of the apes, and there's a lot more stories to tell after this. I\nimagine the next film will be about the all-out war between the apes and\nhumans.\"[13] [Mark Bomback](/wiki/Mark_Bomback \"Mark Bomback\") did an\nuncredited rewrite of the script.[14]\n\n###\nFilming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rise_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Filming\")]\n\nFilming began in July 2010 in [Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver \"Vancouver\"),\n[British Columbia](/wiki/British_Columbia \"British Columbia\").[15] Filming\nalso happened in [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\"),\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\") (the primary setting of the\nfilm),[15] and around [Oahu](/wiki/Oahu \"Oahu\"), [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii\n\"Hawaii\"), which doubled for the African jungle as the schedule and budget did\nnot allow for location shooting in Africa.[16]\n\n### Visual\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rise_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Visual effects\")]\n\nAs the apes in _Rise_ were meant to be actual apes, the producers decided not\nto use actors in ape suits. After considering real apes, instead [Weta\nDigital](/wiki/Weta_Digital \"Weta Digital\") created the apes digitally in\nalmost every case through [performance capture](/wiki/Performance_capture\n\"Performance capture\").[17] Advances in the technology allowed the use of\nperformance capture in an exterior environment, affording the film-makers the\nfreedom to shoot much of the film on location with other actors, as opposed to\nthe confines of a soundstage.[18][19] The main breakthrough was a camera that\nenabled viewing the motion capture dots in daylight, employed mostly for the\nGolden Gate Bridge battle. A maximum of six actors could have their movements\ncaptured, with larger ape crowds using fully digital animals animated using\nWeta's move library. The [Golden Gate Bridge](/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge \"Golden\nGate Bridge\") set used both a physical set which was extended digitally, and a\nfully computer-generated model of the bridge that also included the ocean and\nnearby hills.[20]\n\nAfter shooting the actors playing humans interacting with others wearing the\nmotion capture suits, a clean plate was shot with actors for extra reference.\nActor-stuntman [Terry Notary](/wiki/Terry_Notary \"Terry Notary\") guided the\nactors on realistic ape movement, while Weta studied the chimps in the\n[Wellington Zoo](/wiki/Wellington_Zoo \"Wellington Zoo\") for reference. The\ndigital apes also received detailed models with skeletons, muscles and nerve\ntissue layers for accurate animation. Cast models of apes' heads and limbs\nhelped the texture department replicate skin details such as wrinkles and\npores. Given the difference between human and chimpanzee facial muscles, the\nanimators tweaked the performance through a new facial muscle system adding\ndynamics, ballistics, and secondary motion. As the silent performance required\nexpressive eyes, a new eye model was made to depict both greater accuracy in\nmuscle movement in and around the eyes, and also tears, [pupil\ndilation](/wiki/Pupillary_response \"Pupillary response\"), and light\nrefraction.[17][21] While [Andy Serkis](/wiki/Andy_Serkis \"Andy Serkis\") was\nthe primary performer for Caesar, as the effects team considered that at times\n\"Andy overcame the character,\" other motion capture team actors were also\nused, especially [Devyn Dalton](/wiki/Devyn_Dalton \"Devyn Dalton\"), whose\nheight matched that of a chimpanzee. Along with that, they used Notary to play\nCaesar in stunt-filled scenes such as the Golden Gate Bridge scene.[22]\n\n###\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rise_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\nThe score for the film was written by [Patrick Doyle](/wiki/Patrick_Doyle\n\"Patrick Doyle\") and performed by the [Hollywood Studio\nSymphony](/wiki/Hollywood_Studio_Symphony \"Hollywood Studio Symphony\")\nconducted by [James Shearman](/wiki/James_Shearman \"James Shearman\").[23] The\nmain concern was to have the music help progress the plot in the scenes\nwithout dialogue, for instance, conveying the emotions of Caesar's\nrelationships with Will and Charles. To turn the score into a \"driving force\nthat keeps audiences paying attention,\" Doyle employed an African-American\nchorus and focused on percussion and \"low and deep\" orchestra sounds.
