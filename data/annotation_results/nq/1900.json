The listed total area changed to\n9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi) in 1997 (Great Lakes area and coastal waters\nadded), to 9,631,418 km2 (3,718,711 sq mi) in 2004, to 9,631,420 km2\n(3,718,710 sq mi) in 2006, and to 9,826,630 km2 (3,794,080 sq mi) in 2007\n(territorial waters added). Currently, the CIA _World Factbook_ gives\n9,826,675 km2 (3,794,100 sq mi),[2] the [United Nations Statistics\nDivision](/wiki/United_Nations_Statistics_Division \"United Nations Statistics\nDivision\") gives 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi),[3] and the _Encyclopædia\nBritannica_ gives 9,522,055 km2 (3,676,486 sq mi)(Great Lakes area included\nbut not coastal waters).[4] These sources consider only the 50 states and the\nFederal District, and exclude overseas territories.\n\nBy [total area](/wiki/List_of_countries_and_outlying_territories_by_total_area\n\"List of countries and outlying territories by total area\")\n([water](/wiki/Territorial_waters \"Territorial waters\") as well as land), the\nUnited States is either slightly larger or smaller than the [People's Republic\nof China](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China \"People's Republic of China\"),\nmaking it the world's third or fourth largest country. China and the United\nStates are smaller than [Russia](/wiki/Russia \"Russia\") and\n[Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") in total area, but are larger than\n[Brazil](/wiki/Brazil \"Brazil\"). By land area only (exclusive of waters), the\nUnited States is the world's third largest country, after Russia and China,\nwith Canada in fourth. Whether the US or China is the third largest country by\ntotal area depends on two factors: (1) The validity of China's claim on [Aksai\nChin](/wiki/Aksai_Chin \"Aksai Chin\") and [Trans-Karakoram Tract](/wiki/Trans-\nKarakoram_Tract \"Trans-Karakoram Tract\"). Both these territories are also\nclaimed by India, so are not counted; and (2) How US calculates its own\nsurface area. Since the initial publishing of the World Factbook, the CIA has\nupdated the total area of United States a number of times.[5]\n\n## General\ncharacteristics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Geography_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: General characteristics\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/USA-\nsatellite.jpg/450px-USA-satellite.jpg)](/wiki/File:USA-satellite.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:USA-satellite.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA satellite composite image of the [contiguous United\nStates](/wiki/Contiguous_United_States \"Contiguous United States\").\n[Deciduous](/wiki/Deciduous \"Deciduous\") vegetation and\n[grasslands](/wiki/Grassland \"Grassland\") prevail in the east, transitioning\nto [prairies](/wiki/Prairie \"Prairie\"), [boreal forests](/wiki/Boreal_forest\n\"Boreal forest\"), and the [Rockies](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains \"Rocky Mountains\")\nin the west, and [deserts](/wiki/Desert \"Desert\") in the southwest.

A broad, flat coastal plain\nlines the Atlantic and Gulf shores from the Texas-Mexico border to New York\nCity, and includes the Florida peninsula. Areas further inland feature rolling\nhills, mountains, and a diverse collection of temperate and subtropical moist\nand wet forests. The [Appalachian Mountains](/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains\n\"Appalachian Mountains\") form a line of low mountains separating the eastern\nseaboard from the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Basin.\n\nThe five [Great Lakes](/wiki/Great_Lakes \"Great Lakes\") are located in the\nnorth-central portion of the country, four of them forming part of the border\nwith [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\"), only [Lake Michigan](/wiki/Lake_Michigan\n\"Lake Michigan\") situated entirely within United States. The southeast United\nStates, generally stretching from the [Ohio River](/wiki/Ohio_River \"Ohio\nRiver\") on south, includes a variety of warm temperate and subtropical moist\nand wet forests, as well as warm temperate and subtropical dry forests nearer\nthe Great Plains in the west of the region. West of the Appalachians lies the\nlush [Mississippi River](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\") basin\nand two large eastern tributaries, the [Ohio River](/wiki/Ohio_River \"Ohio\nRiver\") and the [Tennessee River](/wiki/Tennessee_River \"Tennessee River\").\nThe [Ohio](/wiki/Ohio_Valley \"Ohio Valley\") and\n[Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee_Valley \"Tennessee Valley\") Valleys and the\n[Midwest](/wiki/Midwestern_U.S. \"Midwestern U.S.\") consist largely of rolling\nhills, interior highlands and small mountains, jungly marsh and swampland near\nthe Ohio River, and productive [farmland](/wiki/Farmland \"Farmland\"),\nstretching south to the [Gulf Coast](/wiki/U.S._Gulf_Coast \"U.S. Gulf Coast\").\nThe Midwest also has a vast amount of cave systems.\n\nThe [Great Plains](/wiki/Great_Plains \"Great Plains\") lie west of the\nMississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains. A large portion of the\ncountry's agricultural products are grown in the Great Plains. Before their\ngeneral conversion to farmland, the Great Plains were noted for their\nextensive grasslands, from [tallgrass prairie](/wiki/Tallgrass_prairie\n\"Tallgrass prairie\") in the eastern plains to [shortgrass\nsteppe](/wiki/Shortgrass_prairie \"Shortgrass prairie\") in the western [High\nPlains](/wiki/High_Plains_\\(United_States\\) \"High Plains \\(United States\\)\").\nElevation rises gradually from less than a few hundred feet near the\nMississippi River to more than a mile high in the High Plains. The generally\nlow relief of the plains is broken in several places, most notably in the\n[Ozark](/wiki/The_Ozarks \"The Ozarks\") and [Ouachita\nMountains](/wiki/Ouachita_Mountains \"Ouachita Mountains\"), which form the\n[U.S. Interior Highlands](/wiki/U.S._Interior_Highlands \"U.S. Interior\nHighlands\"), the only major mountainous region between the [Rocky\nMountains](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains \"Rocky Mountains\") and the [Appalachian\nMountains](/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains \"Appalachian Mountains\").[6][7]\n\nThe Great Plains come to an abrupt end at the [Rocky\nMountains](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains \"Rocky Mountains\"). The Rocky Mountains form\na large portion of the [Western U.S.](/wiki/Western_U.S. \"Western U.S.\"),\nentering from [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") and stretching nearly to\n[Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\"). The Rocky Mountain region is the highest\nregion of the United States by average elevation. The Rocky Mountains\ngenerally contain fairly mild slopes and wider peaks compared to some of the\nother great mountain ranges, with a few exceptions (such as the [Teton\nMountains](/wiki/Teton_Mountains \"Teton Mountains\") in [Wyoming](/wiki/Wyoming\n\"Wyoming\") and the [Sawatch Range](/wiki/Sawatch_Range \"Sawatch Range\") in\n[Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\")). The highest peaks of the Rockies are\nfound in Colorado, the tallest peak being [Mount Elbert](/wiki/Mount_Elbert\n\"Mount Elbert\") at 14,440 ft (4,400 m). The Rocky Mountains contain some of\nthe most spectacular, and well known scenery in the world. In addition,\ninstead of being one generally continuous and solid mountain range, it is\nbroken up into a number of smaller, intermittent mountain ranges, forming a\nlarge series of basins and valleys.\n\nWest of the Rocky Mountains lies the [Intermontane\nPlateaus](/wiki/Intermontane_Plateaus \"Intermontane Plateaus\") (also known as\nthe [Intermountain West](/wiki/Intermountain_West \"Intermountain West\")), a\nlarge, arid desert lying between the Rockies and the\n[Cascades](/wiki/Cascade_Range \"Cascade Range\") and [Sierra\nNevada](/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_\\(U.S.\\) \"Sierra Nevada \\(U.S.\\)\") ranges. The\nlarge southern portion, known as the [Great Basin](/wiki/Great_Basin \"Great\nBasin\"), consists of salt flats, drainage basins, and many small north-south\nmountain ranges. The [Southwest](/wiki/Southwestern_United_States\n\"Southwestern United States\") is predominantly a low-lying desert region. A\nportion known as the [Colorado Plateau](/wiki/Colorado_Plateau \"Colorado\nPlateau\"), centered around the [Four Corners](/wiki/Four_Corners \"Four\nCorners\") region, is considered to have some of the most spectacular scenery\nin the world. It is accentuated in such national parks as [Grand\nCanyon](/wiki/Grand_Canyon_National_Park \"Grand Canyon National Park\"),\n[Arches](/wiki/Arches_National_Park \"Arches National Park\"), [Mesa Verde\nNational Park](/wiki/Mesa_Verde_National_Park \"Mesa Verde National Park\") and\n[Bryce Canyon](/wiki/Bryce_Canyon_National_Park \"Bryce Canyon National Park\"),\namong others. Other smaller Intermontane areas include the Columbia Plateau\ncovering eastern Washington, western Idaho and northeast Oregon and the Snake\nRiver Plain in Southern Idaho.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Grand_Canyon_from_Moran_Point.jpeg/300px-\nGrand_Canyon_from_Moran_Point.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Grand_Canyon_from_Moran_Point.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Grand_Canyon_from_Moran_Point.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[The Grand Canyon](/wiki/The_Grand_Canyon \"The Grand Canyon\") from Moran\nPoint. The Grand Canyon is among the most famous locations in the country.\n\nThe Intermontane Plateaus come to an end at the [Cascade\nRange](/wiki/Cascade_Range \"Cascade Range\") and the [Sierra\nNevada](/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_\\(U.S.\\) \"Sierra Nevada \\(U.S.\\)\"). The Cascades\nconsist of largely intermittent, volcanic mountains, many rising prominently\nfrom the surrounding landscape. The Sierra Nevada, further south, is a high,\nrugged, and dense mountain range. It contains the highest point in the\ncontiguous 48 states, [Mount Whitney](/wiki/Mount_Whitney \"Mount Whitney\")\n(14,505 ft or 4,421 m). It is located at the boundary between California's\nInyo and Tulare counties, just 84.6 mi or 136.2 km west-northwest of the\nlowest point in North America at the [Badwater Basin](/wiki/Badwater_Basin\n\"Badwater Basin\") in [Death Valley National\nPark](/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park \"Death Valley National Park\") at 279 ft\nor 85 m below sea level.[8]\n\nThese areas contain some spectacular scenery as well, as evidenced by such\nnational parks as [Yosemite](/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park \"Yosemite National\nPark\") and [Mount Rainier](/wiki/Mount_Rainier_National_Park \"Mount Rainier\nNational Park\"). West of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada is a series of\nvalleys, such as the [Central Valley](/wiki/Central_Valley_\\(California\\)\n\"Central Valley \\(California\\)\") in [California](/wiki/California\n\"California\") and the [Willamette Valley](/wiki/Willamette_Valley \"Willamette\nValley\") in [Oregon](/wiki/Oregon \"Oregon\"). Along the coast is a series of\nlow mountain ranges known as the [Pacific Coast\nRanges](/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Ranges \"Pacific Coast Ranges\"). Much of the\n[Pacific Northwest](/wiki/Pacific_Northwest \"Pacific Northwest\") coast is\ninhabited by some of the densest vegetation outside of the\n[Tropics](/wiki/Tropics \"Tropics\"), and also the tallest trees in the world\n(the [Redwoods](/wiki/Coast_Redwood \"Coast Redwood\")).\n\nAlaska contains some of the most dramatic and untapped scenery in the country.\nTall, prominent mountain ranges rise up sharply from broad, flat tundra\nplains. On the islands off the south and southwest coast are many\n[volcanoes](/wiki/Volcanoes \"Volcanoes\"). Hawaii, far to the south of Alaska\nin the Pacific Ocean, is a chain of tropical, volcanic islands, popular as a\ntourist destination for many from [East Asia](/wiki/East_Asia \"East Asia\") and\nthe mainland United States.\n\nThe territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands encompass a number\nof tropical isles in the northeastern [Caribbean Sea](/wiki/Caribbean_Sea\n\"Caribbean Sea\"). In the Pacific Ocean the territories of Guam and the\nNorthern Mariana Islands occupy the limestone and volcanic isles of the\n[Mariana archipelago](/wiki/Mariana_Islands \"Mariana Islands\"), and American\nSamoa (the only populated US territory in the southern hemisphere) encompasses\nvolcanic peaks and coral atolls in the eastern part of the [Samoan\nIslands](/wiki/Samoan_Islands \"Samoan Islands\") chain.\n\n### Physiographic\nregions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Geography_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Physiographic regions\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/US_physiographic_map.jpg/450px-\nUS_physiographic_map.jpg)](/wiki/File:US_physiographic_map.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:US_physiographic_map.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA [physiographical](/wiki/Physiography \"Physiography\") map of the contiguous\n48 states of the U.S. The map indicates the age of the exposed surface as well\nas the type of terrain.\n\nThe geography of the United States varies across their immense area.

The\nAppalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast-southwest trend to crustal\ndeformations which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what\nlater came to be the Appalachian mountain system. This system had its climax\nof deformation so long ago (probably in [Permian](/wiki/Permian \"Permian\")\ntime) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low\nrelief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along\nthe earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual\nmountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but\nfor a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the\nnortheast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally,\nthe southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance\nof the land upon the sea.\n\nWhile the Atlantic coast is relatively low, the Pacific coast is, with few\nexceptions, hilly or mountainous. This coast has been defined chiefly by\ngeologically recent crustal deformations, and hence still preserves a greater\nrelief than that of the Atlantic. The low Atlantic coast and the hilly or\nmountainous Pacific coast foreshadow the leading features in the distribution\nof mountains within the United States.\n\nThe east coast Appalachian system, originally forest covered, is relatively\nlow and narrow and is bordered on the southeast and south by an important\ncoastal plain. The [Cordilleran system](/wiki/American_cordillera \"American\ncordillera\") on the western side of the continent is lofty, broad and\ncomplicated having two branches, the Rocky Mountain System and the Pacific\nMountain System. In between these mountain systems lie the Intermontaine\nPlateaus. Both the [Columbia River](/wiki/Columbia_River \"Columbia River\") and\n[Colorado River](/wiki/Colorado_River \"Colorado River\") rise far inland near\nthe easternmost members of the Cordilleran system, and flow through plateaus\nand intermontaine basins to the ocean. Heavy forests cover the northwest\ncoast, but elsewhere trees are found only on the higher ranges below the\nAlpine region. The [intermontane](/wiki/Intermontane \"Intermontane\") valleys,\nplateaus and basins range from treeless to desert with the most arid region\nbeing in the southwest.\n\nThe Laurentian Highlands, the Interior Plains and the Interior Highlands lie\nbetween the two coasts, stretching from the [Gulf of\nMexico](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of Mexico\") northward, far beyond the\nnational boundary, to the [Arctic Ocean](/wiki/Arctic_Ocean \"Arctic Ocean\").\nThe central plains are divided by a hardly perceptible height of land into a\n[Canadian](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") and a United States portion.

The climate is subtropical\nin the [Southern United States](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United\nStates\"), tropical in [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\") and southern\n[Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\"), polar in Alaska, semiarid in the Great\nPlains west of the [100th meridian](/wiki/100th_meridian_west \"100th meridian\nwest\"), Mediterranean in coastal [California](/wiki/California \"California\")\nand arid in the [Great Basin](/wiki/Great_Basin \"Great Basin\") and the\n[Southwest](/wiki/Southwest \"Southwest\"). Its comparatively favorable\nagricultural climate contributed (in part) to the country's rise as a world\npower, with infrequent severe drought in the major agricultural regions, a\ngeneral lack of widespread flooding, and a mainly temperate climate that\nreceives adequate precipitation.\n\nThe main influence on U.S. weather is the [polar jet stream](/wiki/Jet_stream\n\"Jet stream\") which migrates northward into Canada in the summer months, and\nthen southward into the USA in the winter months. The jet stream brings in\nlarge low pressure systems from the northern [Pacific\nOcean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean \"Pacific Ocean\") that enter the US mainland over\nthe Pacific Northwest. The [Cascade Range](/wiki/Cascade_Range \"Cascade\nRange\"), [Sierra Nevada](/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_\\(U.S.\\) \"Sierra Nevada\n\\(U.S.\\)\"), and [Rocky Mountains](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains \"Rocky Mountains\")\npick up most of the moisture from these systems as they move eastward. Greatly\ndiminished by the time they reach the High Plains, much of the moisture has\nbeen sapped by the [orographic\neffect](/wiki/Precipitation_\\(meteorology\\)#Orographic_precipitation\n\"Precipitation \\(meteorology\\)\") as it is forced over several mountain ranges.\n\nOnce it moves over the Great Plains, uninterrupted flat land allows it to\nreorganize and can lead to major clashes of air masses. In addition, moisture\nfrom the [Gulf of Mexico](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of Mexico\") is often\ndrawn northward. When combined with a powerful jet stream, this can lead to\nviolent thunderstorms, especially during spring and summer. Sometimes during\nwinter these storms can combine with another low pressure system as they move\nup the East Coast and into the [Atlantic Ocean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic\nOcean\"), where they intensify rapidly. These storms are known as\n[Nor'easters](/wiki/Nor%27easter \"Nor'easter\") and often bring widespread,\nheavy rain, wind, and snowfall to [New England](/wiki/New_England \"New\nEngland\"). The uninterrupted grasslands of the Great Plains also lead to some\nof the most extreme climate swings in the world. Temperatures can rise or drop\nrapidly and winds can be extreme, and the flow of heat waves or Arctic air\nmasses often advance uninterrupted through the plains.\n\nThe [Great Basin](/wiki/Great_Basin \"Great Basin\") and [Columbia\nPlateau](/wiki/Columbia_Plateau \"Columbia Plateau\") (the [Intermontane\nPlateaus](/wiki/Intermontane_Plateaus \"Intermontane Plateaus\")) are arid or\nsemiarid regions that lie in the rain shadow of the\n[Cascades](/wiki/Cascade_Mountains \"Cascade Mountains\") and [Sierra\nNevada](/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_\\(U.S.\\) \"Sierra Nevada \\(U.S.\\)\"). Precipitation\naverages less than 15 inches (38 cm). The [Southwest](/wiki/Southwestern_U.S.\n\"Southwestern U.S.\") is a hot desert, with temperatures exceeding 100 °F (37.8\n°C) for several weeks at a time in summer. The Southwest and the Great Basin\nare also affected by the [monsoon](/wiki/Monsoon \"Monsoon\") from the [Gulf of\nCalifornia](/wiki/Gulf_of_California \"Gulf of California\") from July to\nSeptember, which brings localized but often severe thunderstorms to the\nregion.\n\nMuch of California consists of a [Mediterranean\nclimate](/wiki/Mediterranean_climate \"Mediterranean climate\"), with sometimes\nexcessive rainfall from October–April and nearly no rain the rest of the year.\nIn the [Pacific Northwest](/wiki/Pacific_Northwest \"Pacific Northwest\") rain\nfalls year-round, but is much heavier during winter and spring. The mountains\nof the west receive abundant precipitation and very heavy snowfall. The\nCascades are one of the snowiest places in the world, with some places\naveraging over 600 inches (1,524 cm) of snow annually, but the lower\nelevations closer to the coast receive very little snow.\n\nFlorida has a [subtropical climate](/wiki/Subtropical_climate \"Subtropical\nclimate\") in the northern part of the state and a [tropical\nclimate](/wiki/Tropical_climate \"Tropical climate\") in the southern part of\nthe state. Summers are wet and winters are dry in Florida. Annually much of\nFlorida, as well as the deep southern states, are frost-free. The mild winters\nof Florida allow a massive tropical fruit industry to thrive in the central\npart of the state, making the US second to only Brazil in [citrus\nproduction](/wiki/Citrus_production \"Citrus production\") in the world.\n\nAnother significant (but localized) weather effect is [lake-effect\nsnow](/wiki/Lake-effect_snow \"Lake-effect snow\") that falls south and east of\nthe [Great Lakes](/wiki/Great_Lakes \"Great Lakes\"), especially in the hilly\nportions of the [Upper Peninsula](/wiki/Upper_Peninsula \"Upper Peninsula\") of\n[Michigan](/wiki/Michigan \"Michigan\") and on the [Tug Hill\nPlateau](/wiki/Tug_Hill_Plateau \"Tug Hill Plateau\") in [New\nYork](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New York \\(state\\)\"). The lake effect dumped\nwell over 5 feet (1.52 m) of snow in the area of Buffalo, New York throughout\nthe 2006-2007 winter. The [Wasatch Front](/wiki/Wasatch_Front \"Wasatch Front\")\nand [Wasatch Range](/wiki/Wasatch_Range \"Wasatch Range\") in [Utah](/wiki/Utah\n\"Utah\") can also receive significant lake effect accumulations from the [Great\nSalt Lake](/wiki/Great_Salt_Lake \"Great Salt Lake\").\n\n###\nExtremes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Geography_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Extremes\")]\n\nSee also: [U.S. state temperature\nextremes](/wiki/U.S._state_temperature_extremes \"U.S. state temperature\nextremes\")\n\nIn northern Alaska, [tundra](/wiki/Tundra \"Tundra\") and [arctic](/wiki/Arctic\n\"Arctic\") conditions predominate, where the temperature has fallen as low as\n−80 °F (−62.2 °C).[10] On the other end of the spectrum, [Death Valley,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park \"Death Valley National Park\")\nonce reached 134 °F (56.7 °C), the highest temperature ever recorded on\nEarth.[11][12]\n\nOn average, the mountains of the western states receive the highest levels of\nsnowfall on Earth. The greatest annual snowfall level is at [Mount\nRainier](/wiki/Mount_Rainier \"Mount Rainier\") in\n[Washington](/wiki/Washington_\\(state\\) \"Washington \\(state\\)\"), at 692 inches\n(1,758 cm); the record there was 1,122 inches (2,850 cm) in the winter of\n1971–72. This record was broken by the Mt. Baker Ski Area in northwestern\nWashington which reported 1,140 inches (2,896 cm) of snowfall for the 1998-99\nsnowfall season. Other places with significant snowfall outside the Cascade\nRange are the [Wasatch Mountains](/wiki/Wasatch_Mountains \"Wasatch\nMountains\"), near the [Great Salt Lake](/wiki/Great_Salt_Lake \"Great Salt\nLake\"), the [San Juan Mountains](/wiki/San_Juan_Mountains \"San Juan\nMountains\") in [Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\"), and the [Sierra\nNevada](/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_\\(U.S.\\) \"Sierra Nevada \\(U.S.\\)\"), near [Lake\nTahoe](/wiki/Lake_Tahoe \"Lake Tahoe\").\n\nIn the east, the region near the Great Lakes and the mountains of the\nNortheast receive the most snowfall, although such snowfall levels do not near\nsnowfall levels in the western United States. Along the northwestern Pacific\ncoast, rainfall is greater than anywhere else in the continental U.S., with\n[Quinault Rainforest](/wiki/Quinault_Rainforest \"Quinault Rainforest\") in\nWashington having an average of 137 inches (348 cm).[13] Hawaii receives even\nmore, with 460 inches (1,168 cm) measured annually on [Mount\nWaialeale](/wiki/Mount_Waialeale \"Mount Waialeale\"), in [Kauai](/wiki/Kauai\n\"Kauai\"). The [Mojave Desert](/wiki/Mojave_Desert \"Mojave Desert\"), in the\nsouthwest, is home to the driest locale in the U.S. [Yuma,\nArizona](/wiki/Yuma,_Arizona \"Yuma, Arizona\"), has an average of 2.63 inches\n(6.7 cm) of [precipitation](/wiki/Precipitation_\\(meteorology\\) \"Precipitation\n\\(meteorology\\)\") each year.[14]\n\nIn central portions of the U.S., [tornadoes](/wiki/Tornado \"Tornado\") are more\ncommon than anywhere else on Earth[15] and touch down most commonly in the\nspring and summer. Deadly and destructive [hurricanes](/wiki/Hurricane\n\"Hurricane\") occur almost every year along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf\nof Mexico. The Appalachian region and the Midwest experience the worst floods,\nthough virtually no area in the U.S. is immune to flooding. The Southwest has\nthe worst droughts; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have\nhurt [Ancestral Pueblo peoples](/wiki/Ancestral_Pueblo_peoples \"Ancestral\nPueblo peoples\").[16] The West is affected by large wildfires each year.\n\n## Natural\ndisasters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Geography_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Natural disasters\")]\n\nThe United States is affected by a variety of [natural\ndisasters](/wiki/Natural_disaster \"Natural disaster\") yearly.
