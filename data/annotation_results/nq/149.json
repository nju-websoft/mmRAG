The\ntwo states' teams are frequently referred to as the Blues and Maroons,\nreflecting the respective colours of their jerseys. These were the colours of\nthe [Australia national rugby league\nteam](/wiki/Australia_national_rugby_league_team \"Australia national rugby\nleague team\")'s jersey until the adoption of the green and gold. The Blues\nteam is administered by the [New South Wales Rugby\nLeague](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Rugby_League \"New South Wales Rugby League\") and\nthe Maroons by the [Queensland Rugby League](/wiki/Queensland_Rugby_League\n\"Queensland Rugby League\"). The New South Wales team are sometimes referred to\nby the nickname \"[Cockroaches](/wiki/Cockroach \"Cockroach\")\" and the\nQueensland team as \"[Cane Toads](/wiki/Cane_Toad \"Cane Toad\")\", due to names\ngiven to them by Barry Muir and Johnny Raper respectively. It was reinforced\nby a marketing campaign used in the 1980s where the respective teams were\ncaricatured as such.\n\nWhilst other Australian states also have representative rugby league teams,\nthey have not competed in State of Origin.\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_of_Origin_series&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Interstate Rugby League prior to\n1980[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_of_Origin_series&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Interstate Rugby League prior to 1980\")]\n\nThe first calls for a state of origin selection policy in interstate [rugby\nfootball](/wiki/Rugby_football \"Rugby football\") came before the schism\nbetween the union and league codes eventuated in Australia. In 1900 a\njournalist known as 'The Cynic' wrote in _The Referee_ that star rugby player\nand recent immigrant to Queensland, Stephen Spragg, should be able to play for\nhis home state of [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South\nWales\").[[1]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\noriginoforigin)\n\nSince the beginning of Australian rugby league in 1908, an interstate\ncompetition between [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South Wales\")\nand [Queensland](/wiki/Queensland \"Queensland\") has been conducted from time\nto time. Until 1982 each team drew its players from the clubs based in that\nstate. No consideration was given to the origins of the players\nthemselves.[[2]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\nrugreb)\n\nThe [first of these interstate\ngames](/wiki/1908_Interstate_rugby_league_series \"1908 Interstate rugby league\nseries\") was played at Sydney's Agricultural Ground on 11 July 1908, before\nQueensland had even commenced its club competition. New South Wales easily\naccounted for Queensland in a 43–0 victory. The local media were unimpressed.\n\n    _There can be no doubt the NSW men are improving a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it was nothing else. If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is afraid it will be found wanting. They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland. The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and certainly did not advantageously advertise the new game._\n    -[The Sydney Morning Herald](/wiki/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald \"The Sydney Morning Herald\"), 13 July 1908[[3]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-rugref)\n\nThe interstate series was dominated by New South Wales, apart from a golden\nperiod for Queensland in the 1920s. From 1922 to 1925 Queensland defeated New\nSouth Wales 11 times in 12 matches. At the end of the 1925 season a\n[Kangaroo](/wiki/Australian_national_rugby_league_team \"Australian national\nrugby league team\") team was to be picked for touring Great Britain. Instead\nof announcing an Australian team dominated by Queenslanders, the [Australian\nRugby League Board of Control](/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League \"Australian Rugby\nLeague\") informed the media that the [Rugby Football\nLeague](/wiki/Rugby_Football_League \"Rugby Football League\") had decided that\nthe [Kiwis](/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team \"New Zealand national\nrugby league team\") would provide stronger opposition, and that there would be\nno Australian\ntour.[[4]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\ngallaway) The period spanning 1922 to 1929 saw no Australian team play in\nGreat Britain, the only such hiatus outside the two World\nWars.[[5]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-broncos)\n\nThe New South Wales dominance of interstate football increased after 1956 when\ngaming machines were legalised for all registered clubs in New South Wales.\nThis provided New South Wales football clubs with a revenue source unmatched\nby Queensland clubs. From this time on an increasing number of Queensland\nplayers moved to the much stronger [Sydney\ncompetition](/wiki/NSWRFL_premiership \"NSWRFL premiership\"), becoming\nineligible for Queensland state selection. [Paul Hogan](/wiki/Paul_Hogan \"Paul\nHogan\") famously told a Queensland Rugby League gathering in 1977 that \"every\ntime Queensland produces a good footballer, he finishes up being processed\nthrough a New South Wales poker\nmachine.\"[[6]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\ngallaway)\n\nPrior to 1956, NSW had won 75% and Qld only 25% of series played. From\n1956–1981, NSW dominance soared even higher and Qld wins dwindled to only 3.8%\nwith only 1 series win, in 1959.\n\n### Conception of State of Origin\nfootball[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_of_Origin_series&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Conception of State of Origin football\")]\n\nBy the 1970s the prestige of interstate matches had been seriously downgraded.\nMatches were played mid-week, so as not to interfere with the Sydney club\ncompetition, and the small crowds in New South Wales were hosted at suburban\ngrounds.[12] Interstate football reached its nadir in 1977 when the [New South\nWales Rugby Football League](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Rugby_Football_League \"New\nSouth Wales Rugby Football League\") (NSWRFL) declined to host the Queensland\nteam, and both interstate games were played in\nQueensland.[[7]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\ngallaway)\n\nFormer Queensland captain and Australian vice-captain [Jack\nReardon](/wiki/Jack_Reardon \"Jack Reardon\"), who had later become a\njournalist, was the first to suggest that Sydney-based Queenslanders should be\navailable for selection to represent their state.[13]\n\n[Brisbane _Courier-Mail_](/wiki/The_Courier_Mail \"The Courier Mail\") reporter\n[Hugh Lunn](/wiki/Hugh_Lunn \"Hugh Lunn\"), [Barry Maranta](/wiki/Barry_Maranta\n\"Barry Maranta\") (the future co-founder of the [Brisbane\nBroncos](/wiki/Brisbane_Broncos \"Brisbane Broncos\"))\n[[8]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\noriginwebsite) and Maranta's business partner [Wayne Reid](/wiki/Wayne_Reid\n\"Wayne Reid\") played a part in persuading QRL chairman [Ron\nMcAullife](/wiki/Ron_McAullife \"Ron McAullife\") that the concept could be used\nin rugby\nleague.[[9]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\ncrikey) Lunn told McAullife that \"you can take the Queenslander out of\nQueensland, Ron, but you can't take the Queensland out of the\nQueenslander.\"[[10]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\ngallaway) McAuliffe was initially sceptical. \"What if we recall our boys from\nSydney to play, and we are beaten. Where would we go from there?\" Reid spoke\nto NSWRFL president [Kevin Humphreys](/wiki/Kevin_Humphreys_\\(rugby_league\\)\n\"Kevin Humphreys \\(rugby league\\)\") and suggested that a one-off state of\norigin match could be used as a Test Match selection trial.\n[[11]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-gallaway)\n\nNew South Wales clubs were reticent in their support of the concept and set\ntwo conditions:\n\n  * If the third game was to decide the series it was not to act as a selection trial, and also,\n  * that the expatriate Queenslanders would be under the supervision of a representative of the NSWRFL whose duty it would be to protect the interests of both the NSWRFL and the clubs to which they were contracted. (From 1980 this role was filled by Bob Abbott, a [Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks](/wiki/Cronulla-Sutherland_Sharks \"Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks\") official.)\n\nThree Sydney clubs remained opposed to the plan: [St. George\nDragons](/wiki/St._George_Dragons \"St. George Dragons\"), [South Sydney\nRabbitohs](/wiki/South_Sydney_Rabbitohs \"South Sydney Rabbitohs\") and [Eastern\nSuburbs Roosters](/wiki/Sydney_Roosters \"Sydney Roosters\"). As these clubs\nwere refusing to release players, Humphreys threatened to make the game an\nofficial [Australian Rugby League](/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League \"Australian\nRugby League\") trial, which would make release mandatory. The clubs backed\ndown.[[12]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\nmcgregor)\n\n###\nExperimentation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_of_Origin_series&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Experimentation\")]\n\nSee also: [1980 State of Origin game](/wiki/1980_State_of_Origin_game \"1980\nState of Origin game\") and [1981 State of Origin\ngame](/wiki/1981_State_of_Origin_game \"1981 State of Origin game\")\n\nAfter Queensland lost the first two interstate matches in 1980 (35–3 and 17–7,\nthe second game in front of only 1,638 Sydneysiders) it was announced that [a\n'state of origin' match](/wiki/1980_State_of_Origin_match \"1980 State of\nOrigin match\") would take place on 8 July at [Lang Park](/wiki/Lang_Park \"Lang\nPark\") in Brisbane. The [New South Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales \"New South\nWales\") media gave both the event, and Queensland's chance of winning it,\nlittle credence, calling the game a \"three day wonder\". Australia's 1978\ncaptain [Bob Fulton](/wiki/Bob_Fulton \"Bob Fulton\") called the match \"the non-\nevent of the century\". Ron MacAullife however, was now committed to the\nconcept and vigorously promoted the match. Thousands of tickets were sold\nbefore the game had been officially sanctioned. Although interstate matches in\nBrisbane had still been well attended (24,653 had attended the opening match\nof the 1979 series), few expected the sell-out crowd of 33,210 Queensland\nrugby league fans, delighted to see their heroes in the likes of Arthur\nBeetson representing their home state for the first time ever. Queensland\nconvincingly beat New South Wales\n20–10.[[13]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\nfirstorigin)\n\n> I was strongly against such a match, but last night's gripping clash showed\n> that such a fixture would be a welcome addition to the League program.[14]\n>\n> — Alan Clarkson, journalist for _[The Sydney Morning\n> Herald](/wiki/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald \"The Sydney Morning Herald\")_ , 6\n> October 1980\n\nIn 1981 the first two interstate matches were again played under the old\nselection rules. As New South Wales won the first two matches in the series,\nstate of origin selection rules were used once more in the third match.\nAlthough New South Wales ran out to an early 15–0 lead in the game, Queensland\nrallied to win 22–15.\n\n###\nAdoption[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_of_Origin_series&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Adoption\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e8/First_State_of_Origin_Shield.jpg/150px-\nFirst_State_of_Origin_Shield.jpg)](/wiki/File:First_State_of_Origin_Shield.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:First_State_of_Origin_Shield.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe first State of Origin shield, depicting Queensland's [Wally\nLewis](/wiki/Wally_Lewis \"Wally Lewis\") and New South Wales' [Brett\nKenny](/wiki/Brett_Kenny \"Brett Kenny\").\n\nThe interest generated by the experimental state of origin matches of 1980 and\n1981 and the potential for financial rewards were enough to convince the\nauthorities to play all three games under state of origin rules the following\nyear.[[14]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\noriginhistory)\n\n> The State of Origin format is the only possible way to allow the interstate\n> series to survive.\n>\n> — [Frank Hyde](/wiki/Frank_Hyde \"Frank Hyde\") (2 June 1982)[15]\n\nDespite the Maroons' success so far in the State of Origin experiments, the\nNew South Wales media dismissed the seriousness of the Queensland threat to\nthe Blues' long-held dominance in series wins. Queensland however, under the\nleadership of [immortal](/wiki/The_Immortals_\\(rugby_league\\) \"The Immortals\n\\(rugby league\\)\") captain [Wally Lewis](/wiki/Wally_Lewis \"Wally Lewis\"), was\ninspired by this, and for the first three State of Origin series Queensland\nwon 2 matches to 1.\n\nHowever, in 1985, under the leadership of captain [Steve\nMortimer](/wiki/Steve_Mortimer \"Steve Mortimer\"), New South Wales won the\ndeciding match in front of 29,068 spectators at the [Sydney Cricket\nGround](/wiki/Sydney_Cricket_Ground \"Sydney Cricket Ground\"), claiming the\nseries for the first time. The following year the Blues were able to go one\nbetter and complete the first state of origin whitewash, taking the series\n3–0.[[15]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\noriginhistory)\n\n### 1987: American\ncontroversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_of_Origin_series&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: 1987: American controversy\")]\n\nAfter Queensland had won the 1987 series 2–1, a fourth game was played at\n[Long Beach](/wiki/Long_Beach,_California \"Long Beach, California\"),\nCalifornia to showcase [rugby league](/wiki/Rugby_league \"Rugby league\") to\nthe American\npublic.[[16]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_la-game)\n\nIn _Origin: Rugby League 's Greatest Contest 1980–2002_ (2003) Queensland\nwriter Jack Gallaway tells a story:\n\n    There was one additional Origin contest played in 1987. The Queenslanders had climbed the mountain and at no point did they take the project seriously in any competitive sense. The State of Origin trophy was safely stowed in the [Queensland Rugby League](/wiki/Queensland_Rugby_League \"Queensland Rugby League\") board room at [Lang Park](/wiki/Suncorp_Stadium \"Suncorp Stadium\"), and for the Maroons the visit to the United States was their end-of-season outing, the game an exhibition... Such was the Blues' disappointment at the loss of the State of Origin series that they would go to any length to restore some vestige of their lost pride. The [New South Wales Rugby League](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Rugby_League \"New South Wales Rugby League\") hierarchy told their men to prepare for the contest as though it was a deciding test match.[[17]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-gallaway) The match was played at the [Veterans Memorial Stadium](/wiki/Veterans_Memorial_Stadium_\\(Long_Beach\\) \"Veterans Memorial Stadium \\(Long Beach\\)\") in Long Beach, California in front of 12,349 fans. The Blues won the game 30–18.\n\nIn 1987 the [Australian Rugby League](/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League\n\"Australian Rugby League\") (ARL), [New South Wales Rugby\nLeague](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Rugby_League \"New South Wales Rugby League\") and\n[Queensland Rugby League](/wiki/Queensland_Rugby_League \"Queensland Rugby\nLeague\") agreed that the match would only count towards the players'\nindividual statistics. On 15 July 2003 the [Australian Rugby\nLeague](/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League \"Australian Rugby League\") (whose\nprimary members are originally from the New South Wales Rugby League)\nannounced that the fourth 1987 game was to be classified as an official match,\nand that a win in the state of origin match on 16 July 2003 would take New\nSouth Wales into the overall lead.\n\nARL and NSWRL chief executive [Geoff Carr](/wiki/Geoff_Carr \"Geoff Carr\")\nsaid: \"There had been some debate over whether the Origin fixture . . . in\n1987 was counted as an official match but a search of ARL records has\nconfirmed the status conferred on that clash by the game's governing body at\nthe time. In announcing the match in Big League in April 1987, [Ken\nArthurson](/wiki/Ken_Arthurson \"Ken Arthurson\"), the ARL's chief executive in\n1987, was quoted as saying 'It's an exciting experiment but the match isn't\nand won't be billed as an exhibition match'.\"\n\n###\n1990s[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_of_Origin_series&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: 1990s\")]\n\nAfter the controversy of the match played in the United States, the Queensland\nhalves pairing of [Allan Langer](/wiki/Allan_Langer \"Allan Langer\") and [Wally\nLewis](/wiki/Wally_Lewis \"Wally Lewis\") led the Maroons in their 3–0 series\nwins in both 1988 and 1989. The rise of the Canberra Raiders in the then\nWinfield Cup club competition produced for the Blues the formidable halves\ncombination of [Ricky Stuart](/wiki/Ricky_Stuart \"Ricky Stuart\") and [Laurie\nDaley](/wiki/Laurie_Daley \"Laurie Daley\") who brought New South Wales back\nfrom defeat with two wins in the opening games of the 1990 series. It was\nevident that as the rivalry between the two states grew, the Origin matches\nhad become much more physical forward orientated game than the open running\nplay seen in earlier\nseries.[[18]](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin_series#endnote_ref-\noriginhistory)\n\nAs the great Queensland players from the 1980s began to retire from the game,\nthe Maroons struggled with a team of fresh faces and considerable\ninexperience. The 1992, 1993 and 1994 series all went to NSW as the talent and\nexperience of Blues players such as [Brett Mullins](/wiki/Brett_Mullins \"Brett\nMullins\"), Daley and Stuart in the backs and [Benny Elias](/wiki/Benny_Elias\n\"Benny Elias\") and [Bradley Clyde](/wiki/Bradley_Clyde \"Bradley Clyde\") in the\nforwards gave the Blues the edge when the games were on the line. It wasn't\nuntil the upheaval of the [Super League war](/wiki/Super_League_war \"Super\nLeague war\") in 1995 that the Maroons were able to again clinch a series.\n\nA main cause for concern for Queensland was the fact that the [Brisbane\nBroncos](/wiki/Brisbane_Broncos \"Brisbane Broncos\"), its players and many\nother Queenslanders were not aligned with the\n[ARL](/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League \"Australian Rugby League\") prohibiting any\nplayers signed with the [Super League](/wiki/Super_League \"Super League\") to\nplay for the Maroons. Despite this the Queenslanders won the 1995 series 3–0\nin a shocking white-wash. The 1996 series saw the off-field contract dramas\nput aside as all players were allowed, regardless of contract, state of origin\nselection. Having the majority of the Queenslanders back didn't help the\nMaroons though as the Blues 1996 white-wash with a 3–0 series win of their\nown.\n\nThe Australian game divided in 1997 into two competitions, one run by the\n[ARL](/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League \"Australian Rugby League\") and one by the\nNews Limited-owned [Super League](/wiki/Super_League \"Super League\"), and an\ninterstate series was played in each. Under the Super League banner there was\na Tri-Origin series with a New Zealand side added to the competition. The\n[ARL](/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League \"Australian Rugby League\") meanwhile stuck\nto its traditional format. The teams were selected using origin rules, and New\nSouth Wales and Queensland met twice. These matches do not count towards the\nofficial state of origin record. As with the premiership, players were spread\nbetween two representative tournaments as well.\n\nThe competitions merged again in 1998 as the current [National Rugby\nLeague](/wiki/National_Rugby_League \"National Rugby League\"), and the series\nthat year proved to be enthralling as both sides won a game each away from\nhome, setting up a decider at the Sydney Football Stadium where 39,000 fans\nwitnessed the visiting Queenslanders take the series 2–1. The end of the\ndecade saw a dramatic series with each side taking one game each and game\nthree ending in a draw. Queensland were awarded the series as at the time the\nprevious winners retained the interstate honours.\n\n###\n2000s[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_of_Origin_series&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: 2000s\")]\n\nThe early to mid-2000s saw New South Wales starting to assert its traditional\ninterstate dominance, causing some critics [who?] to question the future of\nState of Origin. However, this imbalance tipped in the third and deciding game\nof the [2006 State of Origin series](/wiki/2006_State_of_Origin_series \"2006\nState of Origin series\"), which is seen as the starting point of Queensland's\nunprecedented dynasty. Queensland followed by winning the [2007\nseries](/wiki/2007_State_of_Origin_series \"2007 State of Origin series\"), as\nwell as the [2008 series](/wiki/2008_State_of_Origin_series \"2008 State of\nOrigin series\"), which made Queensland's streak three series in a row. [New\nSouth Wales](/wiki/New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_team \"New South Wales Rugby\nLeague team\") won Game 1 on 21 May 2008, however Queensland won Game 2 on 11\nJune 2008, and Game 3 on 2 July 2008. Queensland continued to follow this up\nby winning the first two games of the 2009 series becoming the first state to\nwin four series in a row.\n\n###\n2010s[[edit](/w/index.php?title=State_of_Origin_series&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: 2010s\")]\n\nIn 2010, Queensland won its historic, record-breaking, fifth consecutive\nOrigin series with a 23–18 win in the third and final match. This was the\nfirst Queensland team to win all three consecutive State of Origin Games in 15\nyears. Queensland full back Billy Slater won man of the match in the third\ngame and was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as Man of the Series in 2010.

Thurston injured his shoulder in the 30th minute of the match,\nessentially disabling it as he played out the whole match. Thurston was later\nruled out for the rest of the year after scans revealed his shoulder needed a\nreconstruction, ending his representative career as he announced 2017 would be\nhis last representative year. In Game 3, New South Wales went in with an\nunchanged lineup for all three games, the first to do so since 1996.\nQueensland dominated the Blues, winning 22-6, with Queensland winger Dane\nGagai winning the Wally Lewis Medal for Best Player in the series. It also had\nJohnathan Thurston raise the Origin Shield with Queensland Captain Cameron\nSmith, before being chaired off the ground by his teammates, ending Thurston's\nrepresentative career on a high note.\n\nIn 2018, New South Wales won their first State of Origin series in four years,\ndefeating Queensland 22–12 and 18–14 in the first two games.

The [Queensland Rugby\nLeague](/wiki/Queensland_Rugby_League \"Queensland Rugby League\") selected him\nbased on the fact that either [Wavell State High\nSchool](/wiki/Wavell_State_High_School \"Wavell State High School\") or\n[Brisbane Norths](/wiki/Brisbane_Norths \"Brisbane Norths\") was Inglis' first\nsenior football, making him eligible for both states per the rules at the\ntime.[28][29][30] However Inglis had previously played for Hunter Sports High\nSchool in [Newcastle, New South Wales](/wiki/Newcastle,_New_South_Wales\n\"Newcastle, New South Wales\"), in the [Arrive Alive\nCup](/wiki/Arrive_Alive_Cup \"Arrive Alive Cup\"); considered to be a senior\ncompetition. Hunter Sports High coach Steve Dunn said \"there was some talk the\nother day that he was actually brought to Queensland before his 16th birthday\nbut I was coach of the team.
