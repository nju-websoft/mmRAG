The team plays their home games in the [Smoothie King\nCenter](/wiki/Smoothie_King_Center \"Smoothie King Center\") (formerly known as\nthe New Orleans Arena).\n\nThe Pelicans were established as the **New Orleans Hornets** in the [2002–03\nseason](/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_NBA_season \"2002–03 NBA season\") when then-owner\nof the [Charlotte Hornets](/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets \"Charlotte Hornets\"),\n[George Shinn](/wiki/George_Shinn \"George Shinn\"),\n[relocated](/wiki/Relocation_of_professional_sports_teams \"Relocation of\nprofessional sports teams\") the franchise to New Orleans. Due to the damage\ncaused by [Hurricane Katrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina \"Hurricane Katrina\") in\n2005, the franchise [temporarily\nrelocated](/wiki/Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_the_New_Orleans_Hornets\n\"Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets\") to [Oklahoma\nCity](/wiki/Oklahoma_City \"Oklahoma City\"), where they spent two seasons\nofficially known as the **New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets**. The team\nreturned to New Orleans full-time for the [2007–08\nseason](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_NBA_season \"2007–08 NBA season\"). On January 24,\n2013, the franchise announced it would rename itself the Pelicans,[7]\neffective after the conclusion of the [2012–13\nseason](/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_NBA_season \"2012–13 NBA season\").

Many attributed this\nlapse in popularity to the team's owner, [George Shinn](/wiki/George_Shinn\n\"George Shinn\"), who was slowly becoming despised by the people of the\ncity.[8] In 1997, a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her, and the\nresulting trial severely tarnished his reputation in the city. The consensus\nwas that while Charlotte was as basketball-crazy as ever, fans took out their\nanger at Shinn on the team. Shinn had also become discontented with the\n[Charlotte Coliseum](/wiki/Charlotte_Coliseum \"Charlotte Coliseum\"), which,\nalthough considered state-of-the-art when it opened in 1988, had by then been\nconsidered obsolete due to a limited number of luxury boxes. On March 26,\n2001, both the Hornets and the [Vancouver Grizzlies](/wiki/Vancouver_Grizzlies\n\"Vancouver Grizzlies\") applied for relocation to [Memphis,\nTennessee](/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee \"Memphis, Tennessee\"),[9] which was\nultimately [won by the\nGrizzlies](/wiki/Vancouver_Grizzlies_relocation_to_Memphis \"Vancouver\nGrizzlies relocation to Memphis\"). Shinn issued an ultimatum: unless the city\nbuilt a new arena at no cost to him, the Hornets would leave town. The city\ninitially refused, leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either\n[Norfolk](/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia \"Norfolk, Virginia\"),\n[Louisville](/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky \"Louisville, Kentucky\"), or [St.\nLouis](/wiki/St._Louis \"St. Louis\"). Of the cities in the running, only St.\nLouis had an NBA-ready arena (Savvis Center, now known as [Scottrade\nCenter](/wiki/Scottrade_Center \"Scottrade Center\")) already in place and was a\nlarger media market than Charlotte at the time; also, it was the only one of\nthe four to have previously hosted an NBA franchise — the [St. Louis\nHawks](/wiki/St._Louis_Hawks \"St. Louis Hawks\"), who moved to\n[Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta \"Atlanta\") in 1968.\n\nFinally, a new arena in [Uptown](/wiki/Charlotte_center_city \"Charlotte center\ncity\"), which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena (now known\nas [Spectrum Center](/wiki/Spectrum_Center_\\(arena\\) \"Spectrum Center\n\\(arena\\)\")), was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts-\nrelated package, and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team. Polls\nshowed the referendum on its way to passage. However, just days before the\nreferendum, Mayor [Pat McCrory](/wiki/Pat_McCrory \"Pat McCrory\") vetoed a\n[living wage](/wiki/Living_wage \"Living wage\") ordinance. The veto prompted\nmany of the city's black ministers to oppose the referendum; they felt it was\nimmoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees weren't paid\nenough to make a living.[10] After the referendum failed, city leaders devised\na plan to build a new arena in a way that did not require voter support, but\nmade it known that they would not even consider building it unless Shinn sold\nthe team. While even the NBA acknowledged that Shinn had alienated fans,\nleague officials felt such a demand would anger other owners.[11] The city\ncouncil refused to remove the statement, leading the Hornets to request a move\nto New Orleans – a move which would eventually return the NBA to that city\nsince the [Jazz](/wiki/Utah_Jazz \"Utah Jazz\") moved to [Salt Lake\nCity](/wiki/Salt_Lake_City \"Salt Lake City\") in 1979. Before the Hornets were\neliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved the move. As part of a deal,\nthe NBA promised that Charlotte would get a new team, which took the court two\nyears later as the [Charlotte\nBobcats](/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets#2004.E2.80.932014:_Charlotte_Bobcats_era\n\"Charlotte Hornets\").\n\nIn a 2008 interview with the _[Charlotte Observer](/wiki/Charlotte_Observer\n\"Charlotte Observer\")_ , Shinn, who has not returned to Charlotte since the\nHornets moved, admitted that the \"bad judgment I made in my life\" played a\nrole in the Hornets' departure. He also said that if he had it to do all over\nagain, he would not have withdrawn from the public after the sexual assault\ntrial. Shinn emphasized how he was making amends by committing to New Orleans\nsaying, \"I've made enough mistakes in my life. I'm not going to make one here.\nThis city needs us here. We're going to make this (New Orleans) thing\nwork.\"[12]\n\n### 2002–2005: Early years in New\nOrleans[[edit](/w/index.php?title=New_Orleans_Pelicans&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 2002–2005: Early years in New Orleans\")]\n\nThe Hornets opened [their inaugural\nseason](/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_New_Orleans_Hornets_season \"2002–03 New Orleans\nHornets season\") in New Orleans on October 30, 2002, against New Orleans'\noriginal NBA franchise, the now-[Utah Jazz](/wiki/Utah_Jazz \"Utah Jazz\"). In\nthe first regular season NBA game played in New Orleans in over 17 years,[13]\nthe Hornets defeated the Jazz 100–75, and posthumously retired #7 of [\"Pistol\"\nPete Maravich](/wiki/Pete_Maravich \"Pete Maravich\") during halftime. The\nHornets finished the season with a 47–35 record but were defeated by the\n[Philadelphia 76ers](/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers \"Philadelphia 76ers\") in the\nfirst round of the [playoffs](/wiki/2003_NBA_Playoffs \"2003 NBA Playoffs\").\nFollowing the season, the team unexpectedly fired head coach [Paul\nSilas](/wiki/Paul_Silas \"Paul Silas\") and replaced him with Alan Bristow. The\nHornets began the [2003–04 season](/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_NBA_season \"2003–04\nNBA season\") strong with a 17–7 start but sputtered at the end and finished\n41–41. They lost to the [Miami Heat](/wiki/Miami_Heat \"Miami Heat\") in the\nfirst round of the [2004 playoffs](/wiki/2004_NBA_Playoffs \"2004 NBA\nPlayoffs\"). After the season, Floyd was fired and the team hired [Byron\nScott](/wiki/Byron_Scott_\\(basketball\\) \"Byron Scott \\(basketball\\)\") as its\nnew head coach.\n\nDuring the first two seasons in New Orleans the Hornets competed in the NBA's\n[Eastern Conference](/wiki/Eastern_Conference_\\(NBA\\) \"Eastern Conference\n\\(NBA\\)\"). The [2004–05 season](/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_NBA_season \"2004–05 NBA\nseason\") saw the team moved to the [Western\nConference](/wiki/Western_Conference_\\(NBA\\) \"Western Conference \\(NBA\\)\")'s\n[Southwest Division](/wiki/Southwest_Division_\\(NBA\\) \"Southwest Division\n\\(NBA\\)\"). In a season marred by injury to the team's three all-stars, the\nteam finished the year with a franchise-worst record of 18–64.\n\n### 2005–2011: Chris Paul\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=New_Orleans_Pelicans&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: 2005–2011: Chris Paul era\")]\n\nIn the [subsequent draft](/wiki/2005_NBA_draft \"2005 NBA draft\"), the Hornets\nused their first round pick to select [point guard](/wiki/Point_guard \"Point\nguard\") [Chris Paul](/wiki/Chris_Paul \"Chris Paul\") out of [Wake Forest\nUniversity](/wiki/Wake_Forest_University \"Wake Forest University\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Chris_Paul.jpg/180px-\nChris_Paul.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chris_Paul.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chris_Paul.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Chris Paul](/wiki/Chris_Paul \"Chris Paul\"), selected by the Hornets as the\n4th pick of the [2005 NBA draft](/wiki/2005_NBA_draft \"2005 NBA draft\")\n\nBecause of the catastrophic devastation brought by [Hurricane\nKatrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina \"Hurricane Katrina\") upon the communities of\nsoutheastern [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\"), the Hornets franchise\n[temporarily\nrelocated](/wiki/Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_the_New_Orleans_Hornets\n\"Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets\") its base of\noperations to [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma](/wiki/Oklahoma_City \"Oklahoma City\"),\nin 2005–06 and 2006–07, posting records of 38–44 and 39–43 respectively.[14]\nDuring this time, the franchise was known as the **New Orleans/Oklahoma City\nHornets**. In these two seasons, most home games were played at the [Ford\nCenter](/wiki/Chesapeake_Energy_Arena \"Chesapeake Energy Arena\") in Oklahoma\nCity, while a few remained at New Orleans Arena. One year after the Hornets\nmoved back to New Orleans permanently, the [Seattle\nSuperSonics](/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics \"Seattle SuperSonics\")\n[relocated](/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics_relocation_to_Oklahoma_City \"Seattle\nSuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City\") to Oklahoma City and became the\n[Thunder](/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder \"Oklahoma City Thunder\").\n\nThe Hornets franchise returned to New Orleans full-time for the 2007–08\nseason, with all 41 home games in the New Orleans Arena. The 2008 [NBA All-\nStar Game](/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game \"NBA All-Star Game\") and its accompanying\nfestivities were awarded to New Orleans and a serious marketing campaign was\ncommenced in February 2007. Healthier than previous seasons, the Hornets raced\nto a 29–12 record at the halfway mark, completing the regular season with a\nrecord of 56–26, making the season their most successful ever. The Hornets\nalso won their first-ever division title, winning the [Southwest\nDivision](/wiki/Southwest_Division_\\(NBA\\) \"Southwest Division \\(NBA\\)\").\nHaving clinched the 2nd overall seed for the Western Conference in the [2008\nplayoffs](/wiki/2008_NBA_Playoffs \"2008 NBA Playoffs\"), the Hornets beat the\n[Dallas Mavericks](/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks \"Dallas Mavericks\") in the first\nround but eventually lost to the defending-champion [San Antonio\nSpurs](/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs \"San Antonio Spurs\") in seven games in the\nconference semifinals.\n\nIn August 2008 the Hornets unveiled a modified logo and new uniforms with the\ncolors of Creole blue, purple, and [Mardi Gras](/wiki/Mardi_Gras \"Mardi Gras\")\ngold. Pinstripes were also added to the uniforms. The Hornets also introduced\na new gold alternate uniform in 2010 which was used mostly in games played on\nSaturday at home and on the road. The Hornets finished the [2008–09\nseason](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_NBA_season \"2008–09 NBA season\") with a 49–33\nrecord. Paired up with the [Denver Nuggets](/wiki/Denver_Nuggets \"Denver\nNuggets\") in the first round of the [2009 NBA\nPlayoffs](/wiki/2009_NBA_Playoffs \"2009 NBA Playoffs\"), the Hornets were\neliminated in five games. The Hornets started the [2009–10\nseason](/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_NBA_season \"2009–10 NBA season\") in a\ndisappointing fashion, and head coach [Byron\nScott](/wiki/Byron_Scott_\\(basketball\\) \"Byron Scott \\(basketball\\)\") was\nfired after a 3–6 start to the season. General manager [Jeff\nBower](/wiki/Jeff_Bower_\\(basketball\\) \"Jeff Bower \\(basketball\\)\") took over\nthe head coaching duties for the remainder of the season. The Hornets finished\nthe season with a 37–45 record, finishing last in the Southwest division they\nhad won only two seasons before. Jeff Bower later resigned as head coach, and\n[Monty Williams](/wiki/Monty_Williams \"Monty Williams\") was brought in as new\nhead coach. The team finished the [2010–11\nseason](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_NBA_season \"2010–11 NBA season\") with a 46–36\nrecord and qualified for the [2011 NBA Playoffs](/wiki/2011_NBA_Playoffs \"2011\nNBA Playoffs\"), where they lost to the Lakers 4–2.\n\nIn December 2010 the NBA purchased the Hornets from [George\nShinn](/wiki/George_Shinn \"George Shinn\") for an estimated $300\nmillion.[15][16]\n\n### 2011–2013: CP3's departure; beginning the Anthony Davis\nera[[edit](/w/index.php?title=New_Orleans_Pelicans&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: 2011–2013: CP3's departure; beginning the Anthony Davis era\")]\n\nBefore the 2011–12 NBA season, the Hornets were considering trade offers for\nChris Paul. Paul eventually requested a trade to the [New York\nKnicks](/wiki/New_York_Knicks \"New York Knicks\"). The Hornets looked at many\nteams, including the [Boston Celtics](/wiki/Boston_Celtics \"Boston Celtics\")\nand the [Golden State Warriors](/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors \"Golden State\nWarriors\") as trade partners, but Paul had made it clear he wanted to be\ntraded to New York or Los Angeles. A three-team trade involving the [Los\nAngeles Lakers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers \"Los Angeles Lakers\") and the\n[Houston Rockets](/wiki/Houston_Rockets \"Houston Rockets\") was agreed upon,\nbut commissioner [David Stern](/wiki/David_Stern \"David Stern\") vetoed the\ntrade.[17] On December 14, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a deal with the [Los\nAngeles Clippers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers \"Los Angeles Clippers\") that\nwould send Paul to L.A. in exchange for [Eric Gordon](/wiki/Eric_Gordon \"Eric\nGordon\"), [Chris Kaman](/wiki/Chris_Kaman \"Chris Kaman\"), [Al-Farouq\nAminu](/wiki/Al-Farouq_Aminu \"Al-Farouq Aminu\"), and a first-round draft pick\nacquired by the Clippers from a trade with the [Minnesota\nTimberwolves](/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves \"Minnesota Timberwolves\") in 2004.\n\nAt the end of the 66-game lockout-shortened [2011–12 NBA\nseason](/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_NBA_season \"2011–12 NBA season\"), the Hornets\nhad the worst record in the West, 21–45.\n\nOn April 13, 2012, it was announced that [Tom Benson](/wiki/Tom_Benson \"Tom\nBenson\"), owner of the [New Orleans Saints](/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints \"New\nOrleans Saints\"), had purchased the franchise from the NBA for $338\nmillion.[18][19] In addition, Benson announced that he would change the team\nname to something that would better suit the region, fueling rumors that the\nHornets name could one day return to Charlotte, where the\n[Bobcats](/wiki/Charlotte_Bobcats \"Charlotte Bobcats\") play.[20][21] In June\n2012, Benson appointed two senior Saints executives to supervise the Hornets\nas well: Saints general manager [Mickey Loomis](/wiki/Mickey_Loomis \"Mickey\nLoomis\") became head of basketball operations, overseeing general manager\n[Dell Demps](/wiki/Dell_Demps \"Dell Demps\"), and Saints business operations\nhead Dennis Lauscha took on the same role with the Hornets.[22]\n\nThe Hornets traded [Emeka Okafor](/wiki/Emeka_Okafor \"Emeka Okafor\") and\n[Trevor Ariza](/wiki/Trevor_Ariza \"Trevor Ariza\") to the Wizards for [Rashard\nLewis](/wiki/Rashard_Lewis \"Rashard Lewis\"), whom they bought out, and a draft\npick.\n\nOn May 30, 2012, the Hornets were awarded the first overall pick in the [2012\nNBA draft](/wiki/2012_NBA_draft \"2012 NBA draft\") and subsequently drafted\n[Anthony Davis](/wiki/Anthony_Davis_\\(basketball\\) \"Anthony Davis\n\\(basketball\\)\").

Benson\nhad also heavily favored the names \"Brass\" and \"Krewe\".\n\nHowever, on December 4, 2012, it was reported that the Hornets would change\ntheir name to the New Orleans Pelicans beginning with the 2013–14 season.[23]\nThe team name is inspired by Louisiana's state bird, the [brown\npelican](/wiki/Brown_pelican \"Brown pelican\").[24]\n\nThe name \"Pelicans\" previously had been used by a [minor-league baseball\nteam](/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans_\\(baseball\\) \"New Orleans Pelicans\n\\(baseball\\)\") that played in New Orleans from 1901 to 1957.[25] The Hornets\norganization officially confirmed the name change in a press conference held\non January 24, 2013, where officials unveiled the team's new logos and navy\nblue–gold–red color scheme.[7][26] On April 18, 2013, after the end of the\nteam's 2012–13 season, the team's name was officially changed to the\nPelicans.[27]\n\nFollowing the New Orleans franchise's 2013 disestablishment of the \"Hornets\"\nname, on May 21, 2013, [Charlotte Bobcats](/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets \"Charlotte\nHornets\") owner [Michael Jordan](/wiki/Michael_Jordan \"Michael Jordan\")\nofficially announced the organization had submitted an application to change\nthe name of his franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15\n[NBA](/wiki/National_Basketball_Association \"National Basketball Association\")\nseason pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a\nmeeting in [Las Vegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas \"Las Vegas\"), on July 18, 2013.[28]\nThen-NBA Deputy Commissioner and COO [Adam Silver](/wiki/Adam_Silver \"Adam\nSilver\") had previously pointed out the fact that the league owns the rights\nto the name Hornets and that could speed up the process.[29] The NBA\nunanimously approved the name change starting with 2014–15.[30]\n\nOn June 27, 2013, during the [2013 NBA draft](/wiki/2013_NBA_draft \"2013 NBA\ndraft\"), the Pelicans selected Nerlens Noel 6th overall, and traded him along\nwith a 2014 protected first-round pick for [All-Star](/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game\n\"NBA All-Star Game\") point guard [Jrue Holiday](/wiki/Jrue_Holiday \"Jrue\nHoliday\") of the [Philadelphia 76ers](/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers \"Philadelphia\n76ers\") and the 42nd pick, [Pierre Jackson](/wiki/Pierre_Jackson \"Pierre\nJackson\").[31] At a May 20, 2014 press conference announcing the [Charlotte\nBobcats](/wiki/Charlotte_Bobcats \"Charlotte Bobcats\")' official team name\nchange to Hornets, it was also announced that the Pelicans agreed to transfer\nthe records and statistics of the original Hornets (1988–2002) to the current\nCharlotte franchise, thus unifying all of Charlotte's NBA basketball history\nunder one franchise; the team records and statistics since the 2002 move to\nNew Orleans would be retained by the Pelicans, retroactively turning the\nPelicans into a 2002 [expansion team](/wiki/Expansion_team \"Expansion\nteam\").[1]\n\nTo restate and clarify a confusing series of events: after the 2002 season,\nthe original Hornets moved to New Orleans. In 2004, Charlotte was granted a\nnew franchise, the Bobcats. After the 2013–14 season, the Bobcats changed\ntheir name to the Hornets and reclaimed the history and records of the\n1988–2002 Hornets. As a result, the Hornets are now reckoned as having\nsuspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are now reckoned as\nhaving joined the league in 2002.\n\n#### 2015: Return to the\nplayoffs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=New_Orleans_Pelicans&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: 2015: Return to the playoffs\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Alvin_Gentry_in_2015.jpg/170px-\nAlvin_Gentry_in_2015.jpg)](/wiki/File:Alvin_Gentry_in_2015.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Alvin_Gentry_in_2015.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAlvin Gentry is the New Orleans Pelicans current head coach.\n\nFor the first time under the name Pelicans, the team qualified for the\n[playoffs](/wiki/2015_NBA_Playoffs \"2015 NBA Playoffs\") with a 45–37 record as\nthe number 8 seed in the Western Conference.
