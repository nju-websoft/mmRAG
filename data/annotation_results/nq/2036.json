It is primarily a [solid](/wiki/Solid \"Solid\")\n[ball](/wiki/Ball_\\(mathematics\\) \"Ball \\(mathematics\\)\") with a\n[radius](/wiki/Radius \"Radius\") of about 1,220 kilometres (760 miles), which\nis about 70% of the [Moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\")'s radius.[1][2] It is composed\nof an [iron–nickel alloy](/wiki/Iron%E2%80%93nickel_alloy \"Iron–nickel alloy\")\nand some light elements. The temperature at the inner core boundary is\napproximately 5700 [K](/wiki/Kelvin \"Kelvin\") (5400 °C).[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Discovery\n  * 2 Composition\n  * 3 Temperature and pressure\n  * 4 Dynamics\n  * 5 History\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n\n## Discovery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inner_core&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Discovery\")]\n\nThe Earth was discovered to have a solid inner core distinct from its liquid\n[outer core](/wiki/Outer_core \"Outer core\") in 1936, by the Danish\nseismologist [Inge Lehmann](/wiki/Inge_Lehmann \"Inge Lehmann\"),[4] who deduced\nits presence by studying seismograms from earthquakes in New Zealand. She\nobserved that the [seismic waves](/wiki/Seismic_wave \"Seismic wave\") reflect\noff the boundary of the inner core and can be detected by sensitive\n[seismographs](/wiki/Seismographs \"Seismographs\") on the Earth's surface. This\nboundary is known as the [Bullen](/wiki/Keith_Edward_Bullen \"Keith Edward\nBullen\") discontinuity,[5] or sometimes as the Lehmann discontinuity.[6] A few\nyears later, in 1940, it was hypothesized that this inner core was made of\nsolid iron; its rigidity was confirmed in 1971.[7]\n\nThe [outer core](/wiki/Outer_core \"Outer core\") was determined to be liquid\nfrom observations showing that [compressional waves](/wiki/Compressional_wave\n\"Compressional wave\") pass through it, but elastic [shear](/wiki/Simple_shear\n\"Simple shear\") waves do not – or do so only very weakly.[8] The solidity of\nthe inner core had been difficult to establish because the elastic [shear\nwaves](/wiki/Shear_wave \"Shear wave\") that are expected to pass through a\nsolid mass are very weak and difficult for seismographs on the Earth's surface\nto detect, since they become so attenuated on their way from the inner core to\nthe surface by their passage through the liquid outer core. Dziewonski and\nGilbert established that measurements of [normal modes of\nvibration](/wiki/Normal_modes \"Normal modes\") of Earth caused by large\nearthquakes were consistent with a liquid outer core.[9] It has recently been\nclaimed that shear waves have been detected passing through the inner core;\nthese claims were initially controversial, but are now gaining acceptance.[10]\n\n## Composition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inner_core&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Composition\")]\n\nBased on the relative prevalence of various chemical elements in the [Solar\nSystem](/wiki/Solar_System \"Solar System\"), the theory of [planetary\nformation](/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System#Terrestrial_planets\n\"Formation and evolution of the Solar System\"), and constraints imposed or\nimplied by the chemistry of the rest of the Earth's volume, the inner core is\nbelieved to consist primarily of a [nickel-iron\nalloy](/wiki/Iron%E2%80%93nickel_alloy \"Iron–nickel alloy\"). Pure iron was\nfound to be denser than the core by approximately 3%, implying the presence of\nlight elements in the core (e.g. silicon, oxygen, sulfur) in addition to the\nprobable presence of nickel.[11]\n\nFurther, if the [primordial](/wiki/History_of_Earth \"History of Earth\") and\nmostly _[fluid](/wiki/Fluid \"Fluid\")_ ([still\nforming](/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk \"Protoplanetary disk\")) earth contained any\nsignificant mass(es) of elements denser than iron and nickel, namely the\n[white](/wiki/White_metal \"White metal\") (appearance) [precious\nmetals](/wiki/Precious_metals \"Precious metals\") (and a few others) except\nsilver, specifically the [siderophile elements](/wiki/Siderophile_element\n\"Siderophile element\") then these would necessarily have differentiated to the\nvery center of the core into concentric nested spheres by [Planetary\ndifferentiation](/wiki/Planetary_differentiation \"Planetary differentiation\").\nThe most dense (and [stable](/wiki/Stable_nuclide \"Stable nuclide\"), i.e.\n[platinum](/wiki/Platinum \"Platinum\"), [iridium](/wiki/Iridium \"Iridium\"), and\n[osmium](/wiki/Osmium \"Osmium\"), (etc.) in order of density) of these forming\nthe innermost spheroid(s).[12] While _unstable_ elements of such trans-\niron/nickel density would have mostly [decayed](/wiki/Radioactive_decay\n\"Radioactive decay\") to iron/nickel/lead by the time the earth formed a\ndiscrete core.\n\nSee also: [Densities of the elements (data\npage)](/wiki/Densities_of_the_elements_\\(data_page\\) \"Densities of the\nelements \\(data page\\)\")\n\nIt then necessarily follows that all, or almost all, of these denser elements\nwe have mined (or are even able to) at the surface (or near surface, or even\nat all \"above\" the core) have been delivered later as part of [impact\nobjects/masses](/wiki/Impact_event \"Impact event\").[13]\n\n## Temperature and\npressure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inner_core&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Temperature and pressure\")]\n\nThe temperature of the inner core can be estimated by considering both the\ntheoretical and the experimentally demonstrated constraints on the melting\ntemperature of impure iron at the pressure which iron is under at the boundary\nof the inner core (about 330 [GPa](/wiki/GPa \"GPa\")). These considerations\nsuggest that its temperature is about 5,700 K (5,400 °C; 9,800 °F).[3] The\npressure in the Earth's inner core is slightly higher than it is at the\nboundary between the outer and inner cores: it ranges from about 330 to 360\ngigapascals (3,300,000 to 3,600,000 atm).[14] Iron can be solid at such high\ntemperatures only because its melting temperature increases dramatically at\npressures of that magnitude (see the [Clausius–Clapeyron\nrelation](/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation \"Clausius–Clapeyron\nrelation\")).[15]\n\nA report published in the journal _Science_ [16] concludes that the melting\ntemperature of iron at the inner core boundary is 6230 ± 500 K, roughly 1000 K\nhigher than previous estimates.\n\n## Dynamics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inner_core&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Dynamics\")]\n\nThe Earth's inner core is thought to be slowly growing as the liquid [outer\ncore](/wiki/Outer_core \"Outer core\") at the boundary with the inner core cools\nand solidifies due to the gradual cooling of the Earth's interior (about 100\ndegrees Celsius per billion years).[17] Many scientists had initially expected\nthat the inner core would be found to be\n[homogeneous](/wiki/Homogeneous_mixture \"Homogeneous mixture\"), because the\nsolid inner core was originally formed by a gradual cooling of molten\nmaterial, and continues to grow as a result of that same process. Even though\nit is growing into liquid, it is solid, due to the very high pressure that\nkeeps it compacted together even if the temperature is extremely high. It was\neven suggested that Earth's inner core might be a [single\ncrystal](/wiki/Single_crystal \"Single crystal\") of iron.[18] However, this\nprediction was disproved by observations indicating that in fact there is a\ndegree of disorder within the inner core.[19] Seismologists have found that\nthe inner core is not completely uniform, but instead contains large-scale\nstructures such that seismic waves pass more rapidly through some parts of the\ninner core than through others.[20] In addition, the properties of the inner\ncore's surface vary from place to place across distances as small as 1 km.\nThis variation is surprising, since lateral temperature variations along the\ninner-core boundary are known to be extremely small (this conclusion is\nconfidently constrained by [magnetic field](/wiki/Magnetic_field \"Magnetic\nfield\") observations). Recent discoveries suggest that the solid inner core\nitself is composed of layers, separated by a transition zone about 250 to 400\nkm thick.[21] If the inner core grows by small frozen sediments falling onto\nits surface, then some liquid can also be trapped in the pore spaces and some\nof this residual fluid may still persist to some small degree in much of its\ninterior.\n\nBecause the inner core is not rigidly connected to the Earth's solid\n[mantle](/wiki/Mantle_\\(geology\\) \"Mantle \\(geology\\)\"), the possibility that\nit [rotates](/wiki/Rotation \"Rotation\") slightly faster or slower than the\nrest of Earth has long been entertained.[22][23] In the 1990s, seismologists\nmade various claims about detecting this kind of super-rotation by observing\nchanges in the characteristics of [seismic waves](/wiki/Seismic_waves \"Seismic\nwaves\") passing through the inner core over several decades, using the\naforementioned property that it transmits waves faster in some directions.\nEstimates of this super-rotation are around one degree of extra rotation per\nyear.\n\nGrowth of the inner core is thought to play an important role in the\ngeneration of [Earth's magnetic field](/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field \"Earth's\nmagnetic field\") by [dynamo](/wiki/Dynamo_theory \"Dynamo theory\") action in\nthe liquid outer core. This occurs mostly because it cannot dissolve the same\namount of light elements as the outer core and therefore freezing at the inner\ncore boundary produces a residual liquid that contains more light elements\nthan the overlying liquid. This causes it to become [buoyant](/wiki/Buoyant\n\"Buoyant\") and helps drive convection of the outer core.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nexistence of the inner core also changes the dynamic motions of liquid in the\nouter core as it grows and may help fix the magnetic field since it is\nexpected to be a great deal more resistant to flow than the outer core liquid\n(which is expected to be turbulent).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nSpeculation also continues that the inner core might have exhibited a variety\nof internal [deformation](/wiki/Deformation_\\(engineering\\) \"Deformation\n\\(engineering\\)\") patterns. This may be necessary to explain why seismic waves\npass more rapidly in some directions than in others.[24] Because [thermal\nconvection](/wiki/Thermal_convection \"Thermal convection\") alone appears to be\nimprobable,[25] any buoyant convection motions will have to be driven by\nvariations in composition or abundance of liquid in its interior. S. Yoshida\nand colleagues proposed a novel mechanism whereby deformation of the inner\ncore can be caused by a higher rate of freezing at the equator than at polar\nlatitudes,[26] and S. Karato proposed that changes in the magnetic field might\nalso deform the inner core slowly over time.[27]\n\nThere is an East–West asymmetry in the inner core seismological data. There is\na model which explains this by differences at the surface of the inner core –\nmelting in one hemisphere and crystallization in the other.[28] The western\nhemisphere of the inner core may be crystallizing, whereas the eastern\nhemisphere may be melting. This may lead to enhanced magnetic field generation\nin the crystallizing hemisphere, creating the asymmetry in the Earth's\nmagnetic field.[29]\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inner_core&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nMain article: [History of the Earth](/wiki/History_of_the_Earth \"History of\nthe Earth\")\n\nBased on rates of cooling of the core, it is estimated that the current solid\ninner core started solidifying approximately 0.5 to 2 billion years ago[30]\nout of a fully molten core (which formed just after [planetary\nformation](/wiki/Planetary_core \"Planetary core\")). If true, this would mean\nthat the Earth's solid inner core is not a primordial feature that was present\nduring the planet's formation, but a feature younger than the Earth (the Earth\nis about 4.5 billion years old).\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inner_core&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png) | The Wikibook _[Historical Geology](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Historical_Geology \"wikibooks:Historical Geology\")_ has a page on the topic of: _**[Structure of the Earth](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Historical_Geology/Structure_of_the_Earth \"wikibooks:Historical Geology/Structure of the Earth\")**_  \n---|---  \n  \n  * [Geodynamics](/wiki/Geodynamics \"Geodynamics\")\n  * [Iron meteorite](/wiki/Iron_meteorite \"Iron meteorite\")\n  * [Structure of the Earth](/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth \"Structure of the Earth\")\n  * [Travel to the Earth's center](/wiki/Travel_to_the_Earth%27s_center \"Travel to the Earth's center\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Inner_core&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Monnereau, Marc; Calvet, Marie; Margerin, Ludovic; Souriau, Annie (May 21, 2010). \"Lopsided Growth of Earth's Inner Core\". _[Science](/wiki/Science_\\(journal\\) \"Science \\(journal\\)\")_. **328** (5981): 1014–1017.
