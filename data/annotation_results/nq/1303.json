In addition to these\nstable nuclei, two unstable or [radioactive](/wiki/Radionuclide\n\"Radionuclide\") isotopes were also produced: the heavy\n[hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen \"Hydrogen\") isotope [tritium](/wiki/Tritium\n\"Tritium\") (3H or T); and the [beryllium](/wiki/Beryllium \"Beryllium\") isotope\n[beryllium-7](/wiki/Beryllium-7 \"Beryllium-7\") (7Be); but these [unstable\nisotopes](/wiki/Radionuclide \"Radionuclide\") later decayed into 3He and 7Li,\nas above.\n\nEssentially all of the elements that are heavier than lithium were created\nmuch later, by [stellar nucleosynthesis](/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis\n\"Stellar nucleosynthesis\") in evolving and exploding stars.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Characteristics\n  * 2 Important parameters\n    * 2.1 Neutron–proton ratio\n    * 2.2 Baryon–photon ratio\n  * 3 Sequence\n    * 3.1 History of theory\n    * 3.2 Heavy elements\n    * 3.3 Helium-4\n    * 3.4 Deuterium\n    * 3.5 Lithium\n  * 4 Measurements and status of theory\n  * 5 Non-standard scenarios\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 References\n  * 8 External links\n    * 8.1 For a general audience\n    * 8.2 Academic articles\n\n##\nCharacteristics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Characteristics\")]\n\nThere are several important characteristics of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN):\n\n  * The initial conditions (neutron-proton ratio) were set in the first second after the Big Bang.\n  * The universe was very close to homogeneous at this time, and strongly [radiation](/wiki/Radiation \"Radiation\")-dominated.\n  * The fusion of nuclei occurred between roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang; this corresponds to the temperature range when the universe was cool enough for deuterium to survive, but hot and dense enough for [fusion](/wiki/Nuclear_fusion \"Nuclear fusion\") reactions to occur at a significant rate.[3]\n  * It was widespread, encompassing the entire [observable universe](/wiki/Observable_universe \"Observable universe\").\n\nThe key parameter which allows one to calculate the effects of BBN is the\nbaryon/photon number ratio, which is a small number of order 6 × 10−10. This\nparameter corresponds to the baryon density and controls the rate at which\nnucleons collide and react; from this it is possible to calculate element\nabundances after nucleosynthesis ends. Although the baryon per photon ratio is\nimportant in determining element abundances, the precise value makes little\ndifference to the overall picture. Without major changes to the Big Bang\ntheory itself, BBN will result in mass abundances of about 75% of hydrogen-1,\nabout 25% [helium-4](/wiki/Helium-4 \"Helium-4\"), about 0.01% of deuterium and\n[helium-3](/wiki/Helium-3 \"Helium-3\"), trace amounts (on the order of 10−10)\nof lithium, and negligible heavier elements. That the observed abundances in\nthe universe are generally consistent with these abundance numbers is\nconsidered strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.\n\nIn this field, for historical reasons it is customary to quote the helium-4\nfraction _by mass_ , symbol Y, so that 25% helium-4 means that helium-4 atoms\naccount for 25% of the [mass](/wiki/Mass \"Mass\"), but less than 8% of the\nnuclei would be helium-4 nuclei. Other (trace) nuclei are usually expressed as\nnumber ratios to hydrogen.\n\n## Important\nparameters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Important parameters\")]\n\nThe creation of light elements during BBN was dependent on a number of\nparameters; among those was the neutron-proton ratio (calculable from\n[Standard Model physics](/wiki/Standard_Model \"Standard Model\")) and the\nbaryon-photon ratio.\n\n### Neutron–proton\nratio[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Neutron–proton ratio\")]\n\nThe neutron-proton ratio was set by Standard Model physics before the\nnucleosynthesis era, essentially within the first 1-second after the Big Bang.\nNeutrons can react with positrons or electron neutrinos to create protons and\nother products in one of the following reactions:\n\n     n + e + ↽ − − ⇀ ν ¯ e + p {\\displaystyle {\\ce {n\\ +e+<=>{\\overline {\\nu }}_{e}+p}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {n\\\\ +e+<=>{\\\\overline {\\\\nu }}_{e}+p}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/28070a0758f3087bba3ae4250d2f51c97d78ab42)\n     n + ν e ↽ − − ⇀ p + e − {\\displaystyle {\\ce {n \\ + \\nu_{e}<=> p + e-}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {n \\\\ + \\\\nu_{e}<=> p + e-}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c7f892298b08d9cd8861e592bd4d6b862ef5e886)\n\nAt times much earlier than 1 sec, these reactions were fast and maintained the\nn/p ratio close to 1:1. As the temperature dropped, the equilibrium shifted in\nfavour of protons due to their slightly lower mass, and the n/p ratio smoothly\ndecreased. These reactions continued until the decreasing temperature and\ndensity caused the reactions to become too slow, which occurred at about T =\n0.7 MeV (time around 1 second) and is called the freeze out temperature. At\nfreeze out, the neutron-proton ratio was about 1/6. However, free neutrons are\nunstable with a mean life of 880 sec; some neutrons decayed in the next few\nminutes before fusing into any nucleus, so the ratio of total neutrons to\nprotons after nucleosynthesis ends is about 1/7. Almost all neutrons that\nfused instead of decaying ended up combined into helium-4, due to the fact\nthat helium-4 has the highest [binding energy](/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy\n\"Nuclear binding energy\") per nucleon among light elements. This predicts that\nabout 8% of all atoms should be helium-4, leading to a mass fraction of\nhelium-4 of about 25%, which is in line with observations. Small traces of\ndeuterium and helium-3 remained as there was insufficient time and density for\nthem to react and form helium-4.[4]\n\n### Baryon–photon\nratio[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Baryon–photon ratio\")]\n\nThe baryon–photon ratio, η, is the key parameter determining the abundances of\nlight elements after nucleosynthesis ends. Baryons and light elements can fuse\nin the following main reactions:\n\n     p + n ⟶ H 2 + γ {\\displaystyle {\\ce {p + n -> ^2H + \\gamma}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {p + n -> ^2H + \\\\gamma}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8edd66ec4ae73efa54a5da37e478d861a5324e97)\n     p + H 2 ⟶ He 3 + γ {\\displaystyle {\\ce {p + ^2H -> ^3He + \\gamma}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {p + ^2H -> ^3He + \\\\gamma}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78555c3239ce867ce71b9210ec4f53a08d632c52)\n     H 2 + H 2 ⟶ He 3 + n {\\displaystyle {\\ce {^2H + ^2H -> ^3He + n}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {^2H + ^2H -> ^3He + n}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf7e4f10126617c70cc314355bb411ce9e0bd4f3)\n     H 2 + H 2 ⟶ H 3 + p {\\displaystyle {\\ce {^2H + ^2H -> ^3H + p}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {^2H + ^2H -> ^3H + p}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f544ed27e3ebbcdb4aed17d69966b0b39b5cbf21)\n     He 3 + H 2 ⟶ He 4 + p {\\displaystyle {\\ce {^3He + ^2H -> ^4He + p}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {^3He + ^2H -> ^4He + p}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/191b50329eb344d90115627d24fd3f680858baf7)\n     H 3 + H 2 ⟶ He 4 + n {\\displaystyle {\\ce {^3H + ^2H -> ^4He + n}}} ![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {^3H + ^2H -> ^4He + n}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5121e978f2e5f9ef2a9072e80959a470c68ac04d)  \n---  \n  \nalong with some other low-probability reactions leading to 7Li or 7Be. (An\nimportant feature is that there are no stable nuclei with mass 5 or 8, which\nimplies that reactions adding one baryon to 4He, or fusing two 4He, do not\noccur). Most fusion chains during BBN ultimately terminate in 4He (helium-4),\nwhile \"incomplete\" reaction chains lead to small amounts of left-over 2H or\n3He; the amount of these decreases with increasing baryon-photon ratio. That\nis, the larger the baryon-photon ratio the more reactions there will be and\nthe more efficiently deuterium will be eventually transformed into helium-4.\nThis result makes deuterium a very useful tool in measuring the baryon-to-\nphoton ratio.\n\n##\nSequence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Sequence\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Scheme_of_nuclear_reaction_chains_for_Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis.svg/300px-\nScheme_of_nuclear_reaction_chains_for_Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Scheme_of_nuclear_reaction_chains_for_Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Scheme_of_nuclear_reaction_chains_for_Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis.svg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe main nuclear reaction chains for Big Bang nucleosynthesis\n\nBig Bang nucleosynthesis began roughly 10 seconds after the big bang, when the\nuniverse had cooled sufficiently to allow deuterium nuclei to survive\ndisruption by high-energy photons. (Note that the neutron-proton freeze-out\ntime was earlier). This time is essentially independent of dark matter\ncontent, since the universe was highly radiation dominated until much later,\nand this dominant component controls the temperature/time relation. At this\ntime there were about six protons for every neutron, but a small fraction of\nthe neutrons decay before fusing in the next few hundred seconds, so at the\nend of nucleosynthesis there are about seven protons to every neutron, and\nalmost all the neutrons are in Helium-4 nuclei. The sequence of these reaction\nchains is shown on the image.[5]\n\nOne feature of BBN is that the physical laws and constants that govern the\nbehavior of matter at these energies are very well understood, and hence BBN\nlacks some of the speculative uncertainties that characterize earlier periods\nin the life of the universe. Another feature is that the process of\nnucleosynthesis is determined by conditions at the start of this phase of the\nlife of the universe, and proceeds independently of what happened before.\n\nAs the universe expands, it cools. [Free neutrons](/wiki/Free_neutron \"Free\nneutron\") are less stable than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons\nhave a strong tendency to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires\nthe intermediate step of forming deuterium. Before nucleosynthesis began, the\ntemperature was high enough for many photons to have energy greater than the\nbinding energy of deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was\nimmediately destroyed (a situation known as the **deuterium bottleneck**).\nHence, the formation of helium-4 is delayed until the universe became cool\nenough for deuterium to survive (at about T = 0.1 MeV); after which there was\na sudden burst of element formation. However, very shortly thereafter, around\ntwenty minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and density became too low\nfor any significant fusion to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances\nwere nearly fixed, and the only changes were the result of the\n[radioactive](/wiki/Radioactive \"Radioactive\") decay of the two major unstable\nproducts of BBN, [tritium](/wiki/Tritium \"Tritium\") and\n[beryllium-7](/wiki/Beryllium-7 \"Beryllium-7\").[6]\n\n### History of\ntheory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: History of theory\")]\n\nThe history of Big Bang nucleosynthesis began with the calculations of [Ralph\nAlpher](/wiki/Ralph_Alpher \"Ralph Alpher\") in the 1940s. Alpher published the\n[Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper](/wiki/Alpher%E2%80%93Bethe%E2%80%93Gamow_paper\n\"Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper\") that outlined the theory of light-element\nproduction in the early universe.\n\nDuring the 1970s, there was a major puzzle in that the density of baryons as\ncalculated by Big Bang nucleosynthesis was much less than the observed mass of\nthe universe based on measurements of galaxy rotation curves and galaxy\ncluster dynamics. This puzzle was resolved in large part by postulating the\nexistence of [dark matter](/wiki/Dark_matter \"Dark matter\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n### Heavy\nelements[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Heavy elements\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg/250px-\nNucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA version of the [periodic table](/wiki/Periodic_table \"Periodic table\")\nindicating the origins – including big bang nucleosynthesis – of the elements.\nAll elements above 103 ([lawrencium](/wiki/Lawrencium \"Lawrencium\")) are also\nmanmade and are not included.\n\nBig Bang nucleosynthesis produced very few nuclei of elements heavier than\n[lithium](/wiki/Lithium \"Lithium\") due to a bottleneck: the absence of a\nstable nucleus with 8 or 5 [nucleons](/wiki/Nucleon \"Nucleon\"). This deficit\nof larger atoms also limited the amounts of lithium-7 produced during BBN. In\n[stars](/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis \"Stellar nucleosynthesis\"), the\nbottleneck is passed by triple collisions of helium-4 nuclei, producing\n[carbon](/wiki/Carbon \"Carbon\") (the [triple-alpha process](/wiki/Triple-\nalpha_process \"Triple-alpha process\")). However, this process is very slow and\nrequires much higher densities, taking tens of thousands of years to convert a\nsignificant amount of helium to carbon in stars, and therefore it made a\nnegligible contribution in the minutes following the Big Bang.\n\nThe predicted abundance of CNO isotopes produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis\nis expected to be on the order of 10−15 that of H, making them essentially\nundetectable and negligible.[7] Indeed, none of these primordial isotopes of\nthe elements from lithium to oxygen have yet been detected, although those of\nberyllium and boron may be able to be detected in the future. So far, the only\nstable nuclides known experimentally to have been made before or during Big\nBang nucleosynthesis are protium, deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and\nlithium-7.[8]\n\n###\nHelium-4[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Helium-4\")]\n\nMain article: [Helium-4](/wiki/Helium-4 \"Helium-4\")\n\nBig Bang nucleosynthesis predicts a primordial abundance of about 25% helium-4\nby mass, irrespective of the initial conditions of the universe. As long as\nthe universe was hot enough for protons and neutrons to transform into each\nother easily, their ratio, determined solely by their relative masses, was\nabout 1 neutron to 7 protons (allowing for some decay of neutrons into\nprotons). Once it was cool enough, the neutrons quickly bound with an equal\nnumber of protons to form first deuterium, then helium-4. Helium-4 is very\nstable and is nearly the end of this chain if it runs for only a short time,\nsince helium neither decays nor combines easily to form heavier nuclei (since\nthere are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of 5 or 8, helium does not\ncombine easily with either protons, or with itself). Once temperatures are\nlowered, out of every 16 nucleons (2 neutrons and 14 protons), 4 of these (25%\nof the total particles and total mass) combine quickly into one helium-4\nnucleus. This produces one helium for every 12 hydrogens, resulting in a\nuniverse that is a little over 8% helium by number of atoms, and 25% helium by\nmass.\n\nOne analogy is to think of helium-4 as ash, and the amount of ash that one\nforms when one completely burns a piece of wood is insensitive to how one\nburns it. The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary\nas there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by\n[stellar nucleosynthesis](/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis \"Stellar\nnucleosynthesis\"). In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang\ntheory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%,\nthen this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would\nparticularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than\n25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the\nmid-1990s, observations suggested that this might be the case, causing\nastrophysicists to talk about a Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further\nobservations were consistent with the Big Bang theory.[9]\n\n###\nDeuterium[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Deuterium\")]\n\nMain article: [Deuterium](/wiki/Deuterium \"Deuterium\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-\nnew.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg)|\nThis section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

The temperatures, time, and densities were sufficient to\ncombine a substantial fraction of the deuterium nuclei to form helium-4 but\ninsufficient to carry the process further using helium-4 in the next fusion\nstep. BBN did not convert all of the deuterium in the universe to helium-4 due\nto the expansion that cooled the universe and reduced the density, and so cut\nthat conversion short before it could proceed any further. One consequence of\nthis is that, unlike helium-4, the amount of deuterium is very sensitive to\ninitial conditions. The denser the initial universe was, the more deuterium\nwould be converted to helium-4 before time ran out, and the less deuterium\nwould remain.\n\nThere are no known post-Big Bang processes which can produce significant\namounts of deuterium. Hence observations about deuterium abundance suggest\nthat the universe is not infinitely old, which is in accordance with the Big\nBang theory.\n\nDuring the 1970s, there were major efforts to find processes that could\nproduce deuterium, but those revealed ways of producing isotopes other than\ndeuterium. The problem was that while the concentration of deuterium in the\nuniverse is consistent with the Big Bang model as a whole, it is too high to\nbe consistent with a model that presumes that most of the universe is composed\nof [protons](/wiki/Proton \"Proton\") and [neutrons](/wiki/Neutron \"Neutron\").\nIf one assumes that all of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, the\ndensity of the universe is such that much of the currently observed deuterium\nwould have been burned into helium-4.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nstandard explanation now used for the abundance of deuterium is that the\nuniverse does not consist mostly of baryons, but that non-baryonic matter\n(also known as [dark matter](/wiki/Dark_matter \"Dark matter\")) makes up most\nof the mass of the universe.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] This\nexplanation is also consistent with calculations that show that a universe\nmade mostly of protons and neutrons would be far more _clumpy_ than is\nobserved.[10]\n\nIt is very hard to come up with another process that would produce deuterium\nother than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the\ntemperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce\nhelium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear\ntemperatures after no more than a few minutes. It would also be necessary for\nthe deuterium to be swept away before it reoccurs.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nProducing deuterium by fission is also difficult. The problem here again is\nthat deuterium is very unlikely due to nuclear processes, and that collisions\nbetween atomic nuclei are likely to result either in the fusion of the nuclei,\nor in the release of free neutrons or [alpha particles](/wiki/Alpha_particles\n\"Alpha particles\"). During the 1970s, [cosmic ray\nspallation](/wiki/Cosmic_ray_spallation \"Cosmic ray spallation\") was proposed\nas a source of deuterium. That theory failed to account for the abundance of\ndeuterium, but led to explanations of the source of other light elements.\n\n###\nLithium[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Lithium\")]\n\nMain article: [Lithium](/wiki/Lithium \"Lithium\")\n\nLithium-7 and lithium-6 produced in the Big Bang are in the order of:\nlithium-7 to be 10−9 of all primordial nuclides; and lithium-6 around\n10−13.[11]\n\n## Measurements and status of\ntheory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Measurements and status of theory\")]\n\nThe theory of BBN gives a detailed mathematical description of the production\nof the light \"elements\" deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.\nSpecifically, the theory yields precise quantitative predictions for the\nmixture of these elements, that is, the primordial abundances at the end of\nthe big-bang.\n\nIn order to test these predictions, it is necessary to reconstruct the\nprimordial abundances as faithfully as possible, for instance by observing\nastronomical objects in which very little [stellar\nnucleosynthesis](/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis \"Stellar nucleosynthesis\") has\ntaken place (such as certain [dwarf galaxies](/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy \"Dwarf\ngalaxy\")) or by observing objects that are very far away, and thus can be seen\nin a very early stage of their evolution (such as distant\n[quasars](/wiki/Quasar \"Quasar\")).\n\nAs noted above, in the standard picture of BBN, all of the light element\nabundances depend on the amount of ordinary matter ([baryons](/wiki/Baryon\n\"Baryon\")) relative to radiation ([photons](/wiki/Photons \"Photons\")). Since\nthe [universe is presumed to be homogeneous](/wiki/Cosmological_Principle\n\"Cosmological Principle\"), it has one unique value of the baryon-to-photon\nratio. For a long time, this meant that to test BBN theory against\nobservations one had to ask: can _all_ of the light element observations be\nexplained with a _single value_ of the baryon-to-photon ratio? Or more\nprecisely, allowing for the finite precision of both the predictions and the\nobservations, one asks: is there some _range_ of baryon-to-photon values which\ncan account for all of the observations?\n\nMore recently, the question has changed: Precision observations of the [cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation](/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation\n\"Cosmic microwave background radiation\")[12][13] with the [Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe](/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe \"Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe\") (WMAP) and [Planck](/wiki/Planck_\\(spacecraft\\)\n\"Planck \\(spacecraft\\)\") give an independent value for the baryon-to-photon\nratio. Using this value, are the BBN predictions for the abundances of light\nelements in agreement with the observations?\n\nThe present measurement of helium-4 indicates good agreement, and yet better\nagreement for helium-3. But for lithium-7, there is a significant discrepancy\nbetween BBN and WMAP/Planck, and the abundance derived from [Population II\nstars](/wiki/Population_II_stars \"Population II stars\"). The discrepancy is a\nfactor of 2.4―4.3 below the theoretically predicted value and is considered a\nproblem for the original models,[14] that have resulted in revised\ncalculations of the standard BBN based on new nuclear data, and to various\nreevaluation proposals for primordial [proton-proton nuclear\nreactions](/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction \"Proton–proton chain\nreaction\"), especially the abundances of 7Be + n → 7Li + p, versus 7Be + 2H →\n8Be + p.[15]\n\n## Non-standard\nscenarios[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Non-standard scenarios\")]\n\nIn addition to the standard BBN scenario there are numerous non-standard BBN\nscenarios. These should not be confused with [non-standard\ncosmology](/wiki/Non-standard_cosmology \"Non-standard cosmology\"): a non-\nstandard BBN scenario assumes that the Big Bang occurred, but inserts\nadditional physics in order to see how this affects elemental abundances.\nThese pieces of additional physics include relaxing or removing the assumption\nof homogeneity, or inserting new particles such as massive\n[neutrinos](/wiki/Neutrino \"Neutrino\").[16]\n\nThere have been, and continue to be, various reasons for researching non-\nstandard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to\nresolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This has\nproved to be of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved\nby better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in\nabundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. The\nsecond reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-\nstandard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on\nunknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no\nexotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a\nhypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see what has to happen\nbefore BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This\nhas been done to put limits on the mass of a stable [tau\nneutrino](/wiki/Tau_neutrino \"Tau neutrino\").[17]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png/32px-Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png)[Cosmology portal](/wiki/Portal:Cosmology \"Portal:Cosmology\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Crab_Nebula.jpg/28px-Crab_Nebula.jpg)[Astronomy portal](/wiki/Portal:Astronomy \"Portal:Astronomy\")\n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png) | \n\n  * [Book: Nucleosynthesis](/wiki/Book:Nucleosynthesis \"Book:Nucleosynthesis\")\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \n  * [Big Bang](/wiki/Big_Bang \"Big Bang\")\n  * [Chronology of the universe](/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe \"Chronology of the universe\")\n  * [Nucleosynthesis](/wiki/Nucleosynthesis \"Nucleosynthesis\")\n  * [Stellar nucleosynthesis](/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis \"Stellar nucleosynthesis\")\n  * [Ultimate fate of the universe](/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe \"Ultimate fate of the universe\")\n  * [Relic abundance](/wiki/Relic_abundance \"Relic abundance\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** <http://www-pdg.lbl.gov/2017/mobile/reviews/pdf/rpp2016-rev-bbang-nucleosynthesis-m.pdf>\n  2. **Jump up ^** Coc, Alain; Vangioni, Elisabeth (2017). \"Primordial nucleosynthesis\". _International Journal of Modern Physics E_. **26** (8): 1741002.
