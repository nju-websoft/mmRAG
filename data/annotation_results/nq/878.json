It moved to [FXX](/wiki/FXX \"FXX\")\nbeginning with the ninth season and has remained there since. It was created\nby [Rob McElhenney](/wiki/Rob_McElhenney \"Rob McElhenney\") who developed it\nwith [Glenn Howerton](/wiki/Glenn_Howerton \"Glenn Howerton\"). It is executive\nproduced and primarily written by McElhenney, Howerton, and [Charlie\nDay](/wiki/Charlie_Day \"Charlie Day\"), all of whom star alongside [Kaitlin\nOlson](/wiki/Kaitlin_Olson \"Kaitlin Olson\") and [Danny\nDeVito](/wiki/Danny_DeVito \"Danny DeVito\"). The series follows the exploits of\n\"The Gang\", a group of debauched, self-centered friends who run the [Irish\nbar](/wiki/Irish_pub \"Irish pub\") Paddy's Pub in [South\nPhiladelphia](/wiki/South_Philadelphia \"South Philadelphia\").\n\nThe series was renewed for a twelfth season that premiered on January 4,\n2017.[2][3] On April 1, 2017, the series was renewed for a thirteenth and\nfourteenth season, which will tie it with _[The Adventures of Ozzie and\nHarriet](/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet \"The Adventures of Ozzie\nand Harriet\")_ as the longest running (number of seasons) live-action sitcom\nin American TV history.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Premise\n  * 2 Cast and characters\n  * 3 Episodes\n  * 4 Production\n  * 5 Broadcast and syndication\n  * 6 Music\n    * 6.1 Soundtrack track listing\n  * 7 Reception\n  * 8 Other media\n    * 8.1 _The Nightman Cometh_ live\n    * 8.2 Russian adaptation\n    * 8.3 Book\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nPremise[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Premise\")]\n\nThe series follows \"The Gang\", a group of five depraved underachievers: twins\n[Dennis Reynolds](/wiki/Dennis_Reynolds \"Dennis Reynolds\") ([Glenn\nHowerton](/wiki/Glenn_Howerton \"Glenn Howerton\")) and [Deandra \"Sweet Dee\"\nReynolds](/wiki/Deandra_Reynolds \"Deandra Reynolds\") ([Kaitlin\nOlson](/wiki/Kaitlin_Olson \"Kaitlin Olson\")), their friends [Charlie\nKelly](/wiki/Charlie_Kelly_\\(It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia\\) \"Charlie\nKelly \\(It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\)\") ([Charlie Day](/wiki/Charlie_Day\n\"Charlie Day\")) and [Ronald \"Mac\"\nMcDonald](/wiki/Mac_\\(It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia\\) \"Mac \\(It's Always\nSunny in Philadelphia\\)\") ([Rob McElhenney](/wiki/Rob_McElhenney \"Rob\nMcElhenney\")), and (from season 2 onward) [Frank\nReynolds](/wiki/Frank_Reynolds_\\(TV_character\\) \"Frank Reynolds \\(TV\ncharacter\\)\") ([Danny DeVito](/wiki/Danny_DeVito \"Danny DeVito\")), Dennis' and\nDee's legal father. The Gang runs the dilapidated Paddy's Pub, an [Irish\nbar](/wiki/Irish_pub \"Irish pub\") in [South\nPhiladelphia](/wiki/South_Philadelphia \"South Philadelphia\").\n\nEach member of the gang shows varying degrees of dishonesty, egotism,\nselfishness, greed, pettiness, ignorance, laziness, and unethical behavior;\nthey are often engaged in controversial activities. Episodes usually find them\nhatching elaborate schemes and often conspiring against one another and others\nfor personal gain, vengeance, or simply the entertainment of watching\nanother's downfall. They habitually inflict mental, emotional, and physical\npain on each other and anyone who crosses their path. They also regularly use\n[blackmail](/wiki/Blackmail \"Blackmail\") to manipulate one another and others\noutside of the group.\n\nThe Gang's unity is never solid, and any of them would quickly dump any of the\nothers for quick profit or personal gain, regardless of the consequences.\nEverything they do results in contention among themselves, and much of the\nshow's dialogue involves the characters arguing or yelling at one another.\nDespite their lack of success or achievements, they maintain high opinions of\nthemselves and display an obsessive interest in their own reputations and\npublic images.\n\nThe Gang has no sense of shame when attempting to get what they want and often\nengage in activities that others would find humiliating, disgusting, or\nshocking. Some of these situations include smoking [crack\ncocaine](/wiki/Crack_cocaine \"Crack cocaine\") and pretending to be [mentally\nchallenged](/wiki/Mentally_challenged \"Mentally challenged\") in order to\nqualify for [welfare](/wiki/Social_security \"Social security\"), attempted\n[cannibalism](/wiki/Cannibalism \"Cannibalism\"), [kidnapping](/wiki/Kidnapping\n\"Kidnapping\"), [blackface](/wiki/Blackface \"Blackface\"), hiding naked inside a\ncouch in order to [eavesdrop](/wiki/Eavesdrop \"Eavesdrop\") on people, tricking\na man into giving his daughter a [lap dance](/wiki/Lap_dance \"Lap dance\"),\nforcing each other to eat inedible items, [huffing\npaint](/wiki/Substance_abuse \"Substance abuse\"), foraging in the sewers for\nvaluables, sleeping with each other's romantic interests, seducing a priest,\nsecretly feeding someone their dead pet, plugging their open wounds with\ntrash, setting a room full of people on fire and locking the door to avoid an\nuncomfortable [Thanksgiving](/wiki/Thanksgiving \"Thanksgiving\") meal,\nfantasizing about killing each other, pretending to have [AIDS](/wiki/HIV/AIDS\n\"HIV/AIDS\") in order to get priority access to amusement park rides, taking\nout [life insurance](/wiki/Life_insurance \"Life insurance\") on a [suicidal\nperson](/wiki/Suicidal_person \"Suicidal person\"), orally siphoning gasoline,\nand [stalking](/wiki/Stalking \"Stalking\") their crushes.\n\nDuring the [Season 7](/wiki/It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_\\(season_7\\)\n\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia \\(season 7\\)\") episode \"The Gang Gets\nTrapped\", in which The Gang breaks into a family's home and has to hide from\nthem when they return, an angry monologue by Dennis captures the essence of\nThe Gang's _[modus operandi](/wiki/Modus_operandi \"Modus operandi\")_ :\n\n“ | We immediately escalate everything to a ten... somebody comes in with some preposterous plan or idea, then all of a sudden everyone's on the gas, nobody's on the brakes, nobody's thinking, everyone's just talking over each other with one idiotic idea after another!

He is a childhood friend of Mac, and high school friend of Dennis and Dee. He is also the roommate of Frank, who may be his biological father. Charlie does most of the actual work and maintenance (referred to as \"Charlie Work\") at the pub. He is [unable to properly read or write](/wiki/Illiteracy \"Illiteracy\"), and is an [alcoholic](/wiki/Alcoholic \"Alcoholic\") [substance abuser](/wiki/Substance_abuse \"Substance abuse\") who is often seen huffing glue or paint. He lives in squalor with Frank in a run-down, vermin-infested apartment and suffers from deep-seated psychological problems, believing his dreams to be haunted by a figure known as \"The Nightman\", who breaks into his home and rapes him. Charlie has unresolved anger issues, often screaming as a means of getting his point across. He also has an [unhealthy obsession](/wiki/Stalking \"Stalking\") with \"The Waitress\", a recurring character who finds Charlie repulsive and shows no interest in him. Despite his character flaws, he is typically the most compassionate and moral member of the gang.\n  * [Glenn Howerton](/wiki/Glenn_Howerton \"Glenn Howerton\") as [Dennis Reynolds](/wiki/Dennis_Reynolds \"Dennis Reynolds\") – Dennis is a co-owner of Paddy's Pub and is Dee's twin brother. Easily the most [sociopathic](/wiki/Sociopathic \"Sociopathic\") of the characters, Dennis is abrasive, narcissistic, selfish, histrionic, and vain. Dennis graduated from the [University of Pennsylvania](/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania \"University of Pennsylvania\"). It is at times hinted that Dennis may be a psychopathic [serial killer](/wiki/Serial_killer \"Serial killer\"), but this remains ambiguous. After the season 12 finale it is unclear whether or not Dennis will be returning for the show's 13th and 14th seasons[5].\n  * [Rob McElhenney](/wiki/Rob_McElhenney \"Rob McElhenney\") as [Ronald \"Mac\" McDonald](/wiki/Mac_\\(It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia\\) \"Mac \\(It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\)\") – Mac is a co-owner of Paddy's Pub. He is Charlie Kelly's childhood friend and Dennis's high school friend and later roommate. The son of a convicted felon who has been in prison for much of Mac's life, he frequently attempts to demonstrate his toughness and refers to himself as the \"sheriff of Paddy's\". He also often brags about his hand-to-hand combat skills, although he typically flees from physical confrontation. Mac is a [Roman Catholic](/wiki/Catholic_Church \"Catholic Church\"), though he often espouses strong [Christian fundamentalist](/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism \"Christian fundamentalism\") opinions, despite his often amoral behavior, such as engaging in casual sex with numerous women, including Dennis' mother. Though it is frequently insinuated Mac harbors [homosexual](/wiki/Homosexual \"Homosexual\") feelings, he maintained an adamant denial of any such proclivity, much to the annoyance of the gang, until the season 12 episode \"Hero or Hate Crime?\", when he finally [comes out](/wiki/Comes_out \"Comes out\").\n  * [Kaitlin Olson](/wiki/Kaitlin_Olson \"Kaitlin Olson\") as [Deandra \"Sweet Dee\" Reynolds](/wiki/Deandra_Reynolds \"Deandra Reynolds\") – Dee is Dennis's twin sister and is the bartender at Paddy's Pub. Dee dreams of becoming an actress, although she lacks any apparent talent and suffers from debilitating stage fright. She wore a back brace in high school, leaving her with the nickname of \"The Aluminum Monster\", and she is constantly referred to by the gang as a bird, due to their perception of her as a giant, awkward, avian-like creature. She majored in psychology at the [University of Pennsylvania](/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania \"University of Pennsylvania\"), but did not graduate. Dee lives alone in an apartment. Her comments and ideas are usually disregarded by the others, though they will often repeat what she has said word-for-word and pretend it was their idea, at which point it will be hailed as a great idea. She is often left to deal with the negative consequences of the gang's activities. Though often the butt of the gang's jokes, she is frequently involved in their schemes. She is portrayed as the angriest and most physically violent of the group and has a history of assault, including setting her roommate on fire in college.\n  * [Danny DeVito](/wiki/Danny_DeVito \"Danny DeVito\") as [Frank Reynolds](/wiki/Frank_Reynolds_\\(It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia\\) \"Frank Reynolds \\(It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\)\") – Frank is the legal father of twins Dennis and Dee, and may be the biological father of his roommate Charlie. He used to be a successful businessman with a long history of illegal operations and dealings with sordid characters, but chose to abandon that life and redeem himself after leaving his \"whore wife\". He has since embraced his \"feral\" nature and describes himself as \"fringe class\". Despite having substantial financial resources, he chooses to share a decrepit studio apartment with Charlie, where they live in squalor and sleep together on a pullout couch. The two also share similar interests, such as playing the inexplicable game of 'Night Crawlers' and foraging naked in sewers for valuables. He is also a severe compulsive gambler, seen betting on everything from grade school basketball to Russian roulette, usually with his chain smoking, and high-stakes betting ring of Vietnamese friends. He styles himself a master manipulator and frequently takes the lead in the group's schemes. He is frequently armed with a handgun and often snorts [cocaine](/wiki/Cocaine \"Cocaine\") as part of his daily routine.\n\n##\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\nMain article: [List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\nepisodes](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes \"List of\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\")\n\nSeason | Episodes | Originally aired  \n---|---|---  \nFirst aired | Last aired | Network  \n| [1](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_1_\\(2005\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 7 | August 4, 2005 (2005-08-04) | September 15, 2005 (2005-09-15) | [FX](/wiki/FX_\\(TV_channel\\) \"FX \\(TV channel\\)\")  \n| [2](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_2_\\(2006\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 10 | June 29, 2006 (2006-06-29) | August 17, 2006 (2006-08-17)  \n| [3](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_3_\\(2007\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 15 | September 13, 2007 (2007-09-13) | November 15, 2007 (2007-11-15)  \n| [4](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_4_\\(2008\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 13 | September 18, 2008 (2008-09-18) | November 20, 2008 (2008-11-20)  \n| [5](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_5_\\(2009\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 12 | September 17, 2009 (2009-09-17) | December 10, 2009 (2009-12-10)  \n| [6](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_6_\\(2010\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 14 | September 16, 2010 (2010-09-16) | December 16, 2010 (2010-12-16)  \n| [7](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_7_\\(2011\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 13 | September 15, 2011 (2011-09-15) | December 15, 2011 (2011-12-15)  \n| [8](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_8_\\(2012\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 10 | October 11, 2012 (2012-10-11) | December 20, 2012 (2012-12-20)  \n| [9](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_9_\\(2013\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 10 | September 4, 2013 (2013-09-04) | November 6, 2013 (2013-11-06) | [FXX](/wiki/FXX \"FXX\")  \n| [10](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_10_\\(2015\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 10 | January 14, 2015 (2015-01-14) | March 18, 2015 (2015-03-18)  \n| [11](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_11_\\(2016\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 10 | January 6, 2016 (2016-01-06) | March 9, 2016 (2016-03-09)  \n| [12](/wiki/List_of_It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_episodes#Season_12_\\(2017\\) \"List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes\") | 10 | January 4, 2017 (2017-01-04) | March 8, 2017 (2017-03-08)  \n  \n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nThe show began as a short film idea written by [Rob\nMcElhenney](/wiki/Rob_McElhenney \"Rob McElhenney\") and [Glenn\nHowerton](/wiki/Glenn_Howerton \"Glenn Howerton\") about a man telling his\nfriend he might have [cancer](/wiki/Cancer \"Cancer\"), while the friend is only\nintent on trying to borrow a cup of sugar for the \"shitload of coffee\" he has\nmade. This was then developed into a pilot called _It 's Always Sunny on TV_\nand was shot on a [digital camcorder](/wiki/Camcorder \"Camcorder\") by [Charlie\nDay](/wiki/Charlie_Day \"Charlie Day\"), [Glenn Howerton](/wiki/Glenn_Howerton\n\"Glenn Howerton\"), and [Rob McElhenney](/wiki/Rob_McElhenney \"Rob\nMcElhenney\"). It was believed the pilot was shot with a budget of just $200,\nbut Day would later comment, \"We shot it for nothing...I don't know where this\n$200 came from...We were a bunch of kids with cameras running around shooting\neach other and [the] next thing you know, we're eleven years in and we're\nstill doing the show.\"[6] This pilot was shopped by the actors around various\nstudios, their [pitch](/wiki/Pitch_\\(filmmaking\\) \"Pitch \\(filmmaking\\)\")\nbeing simply showing the DVD of the pilot to executives. After viewing the\npilot, [FX Network](/wiki/FX_\\(TV_channel\\) \"FX \\(TV channel\\)\") ordered the\nfirst season. Although it is often stated publicly that _It 's Always Sunny in\nPhiladelphia_ was one of the first shows to be shot in [24p](/wiki/24p \"24p\")\nstandard-definition video, using [Panasonic](/wiki/Panasonic \"Panasonic\")'s\n[DVX100](/wiki/DVX100 \"DVX100\") [MiniDV](/wiki/MiniDV \"MiniDV\") prosumer video\ncamera, from the sixth season forward, the show was shot in 24p using high-\ndefinition video cameras.\n\n[Danny DeVito](/wiki/Danny_DeVito \"Danny DeVito\") joined the cast in the first\nepisode of the second season, playing the father of Dennis (played by [Glenn\nHowerton](/wiki/Glenn_Howerton \"Glenn Howerton\")) and Dee (played by [Kaitlin\nOlson](/wiki/Kaitlin_Olson \"Kaitlin Olson\")).\n\nIn March 2017, after the conclusion of the twelfth season, Glenn Howerton\nrevealed he might not return to the series, due to working on other\nprojects.[7] In an August 2017 interview, Charlie Day said that he believes\nHowerton will be back, and that he would not feel right continuing without\nhim.[8]\n\n## Broadcast and\nsyndication[[edit](/w/index.php?title=It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Broadcast and syndication\")]\n\nThe first season ran for seven episodes with the finale airing September 13,\n2005. According to McElhenney,[9] word of mouth on the show was good enough\nfor FX to renew it for a second season, which ran from June 29 to August 17,\n2006. Reruns of edited first-season episodes began airing on FX's parent\nnetwork, [Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting \"Fox Broadcasting\"), in June 2006, for a\nplanned three-episode run—\"The Gang Finds a Dead Guy\",[10] \"Gun Fever\" (which\nwas renamed as \"Gun Control\")[11] and \"Charlie Gets Molested\"[12] were shown.\nThe show would not be shown on broadcast television again until 2011, when FX\nbegan offering the show for syndication.\n\nThe third season ran from September 13, 2007 to November 15, 2007. On March 5,\n2008, [FX](/wiki/FX_\\(TV_channel\\) \"FX \\(TV channel\\)\") renewed _It 's Always\nSunny in Philadelphia_ for a fourth season.[13] On July 15, 2008, it was\nreported that FX had ordered 39 additional episodes of the series, consisting\nof the fifth and sixth seasons. All five main cast members were secured for\nthe entire scheduled run.[14] The fifth season ran from September 17, 2009 to\nDecember 10, 2009.[15] On May 31, 2010, [Comedy Central](/wiki/Comedy_Central\n\"Comedy Central\") began airing reruns of _It 's Always Sunny in\nPhiladelphia_.[16] [WGN America](/wiki/WGN_America \"WGN America\") also began\nbroadcasting the show as part of its fall 2011 schedule.[17]\n\nThe sixth season ran from September 16, 2010 until December 9, 2010, running\ntwelve episodes, plus the Christmas special. The seventh season ran from\nSeptember 15, 2011 until December 15, 2011, running 13 episodes.
