I needed it like I needed air, it was just\nsomething I had to do.\"[11] Miller's first TV appearance was as student-\nturned-sea monster Gage Petronzi on _[Buffy the Vampire\nSlayer](/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\")_ (\"[Go\nFish](/wiki/Go_Fish_\\(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_episode\\) \"Go Fish \\(Buffy the\nVampire Slayer episode\\)\")\", 1998).\n\nMiller's first starring role was in 2002 as the sensitive, introverted David\nScott in [ABC's](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting\nCompany\") [mini-series](/wiki/Mini-series \"Mini-series\")\n_[Dinotopia](/wiki/Dinotopia_\\(miniseries\\) \"Dinotopia \\(miniseries\\)\")_.\nAfter appearing in a few minor television roles, he moved on to co-star in the\n2003 film _[The Human Stain](/wiki/The_Human_Stain_\\(film\\) \"The Human Stain\n\\(film\\)\")_ , playing the younger version of the [Anthony\nHopkins](/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins \"Anthony Hopkins\") character, Coleman Silk. He\nidentified strongly with the core dilemma of the movie, about a black man who\nchooses to \"pass\" as white. Miller worked extensively on the role, not only in\nresearching Anthony Hopkins, but by embarking on a four-month regimen to\naccurately portray Silk as a boxer. Also in 2003, he had a minor role in the\nfilm _[Underworld](/wiki/Underworld_\\(2003_film\\) \"Underworld \\(2003 film\\)\")_\n, playing a doctor and friend of the character [Michael\nCorvin](/wiki/Michael_Corvin \"Michael Corvin\").\n\nIn 2005, Miller was cast as Michael Scofield in [Fox\nNetwork's](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting Company\")\n[television](/wiki/Television \"Television\") drama _[Prison\nBreak](/wiki/Prison_Break \"Prison Break\")_. He played the role of a caring\nbrother who created an elaborate scheme to help his brother, [Lincoln\nBurrows](/wiki/Lincoln_Burrows \"Lincoln Burrows\") ([Dominic\nPurcell](/wiki/Dominic_Purcell \"Dominic Purcell\")) escape death row after\nbeing found guilty of a crime he did not commit. His character had a full\nupper body (front and back) [tattoo](/wiki/Tattoo \"Tattoo\"). Covering both the\nfront of Miller's torso and his back, along with both arms from shoulders to\nwrists, the special effects for the tattoo took over four hours to apply. His\nperformance in the show earned him a 2005 [Golden Globe\nAward](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award \"Golden Globe Award\") nomination for [Best\nActor in a Dramatic\nSeries](/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_%E2%80%93_Television_Series_Drama\n\"Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama\").[12] The show\nwas finished in 2009 after four seasons, but a new nine-episode [fifth\nseason](/wiki/Prison_Break_\\(season_5\\) \"Prison Break \\(season 5\\)\") was\nreleased April 4, 2017 with Miller reprising his role.\n\nMiller appeared in two [Mariah Carey](/wiki/Mariah_Carey \"Mariah Carey\")\n[music videos](/wiki/Music_video \"Music video\"), \"[It's Like\nThat](/wiki/It%27s_Like_That_\\(Mariah_Carey_song\\) \"It's Like That \\(Mariah\nCarey song\\)\")\" as a party guest and \"[We Belong\nTogether](/wiki/We_Belong_Together_\\(Mariah_Carey_song\\) \"We Belong Together\n\\(Mariah Carey song\\)\")\" as her love interest. Director [Brett\nRatner](/wiki/Brett_Ratner \"Brett Ratner\"), who directed the pilot episode of\n_Prison Break_ , was also signed on to direct the two Carey videos. Ratner\ndecided to use Miller in the videos as well.[13]\n\nIn addition, Miller guest-starred in the Season 11 premiere of _[Law& Order:\nSpecial Victims Unit](/wiki/Law_%26_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit \"Law & Order:\nSpecial Victims Unit\")_ as Detective Nate Kendall, a detective from Precinct\n24 of the [New York City Police\nDepartment](/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department \"New York City Police\nDepartment\").[14][15] He also featured in _[Resident Evil:\nAfterlife](/wiki/Resident_Evil:_Afterlife \"Resident Evil: Afterlife\")_ , the\nfourth film in the commercially successful [_Resident Evil_ film\nseries](/wiki/Resident_Evil_\\(film_series\\) \"Resident Evil \\(film series\\)\")\nbased on the [video game series of the same name](/wiki/Resident_Evil\n\"Resident Evil\"); Miller plays [Chris Redfield](/wiki/Chris_Redfield \"Chris\nRedfield\"), one of the protagonists of the video game series.\n\nMiller wrote the screenplay for the film _[Stoker](/wiki/Stoker_\\(film\\)\n\"Stoker \\(film\\)\")_ , as well as a [prequel](/wiki/Prequel \"Prequel\") to\n_Stoker_ , _Uncle Charlie_.[16] He used the [pseudonym](/wiki/Pseudonym\n\"Pseudonym\") Ted Foulke, later explaining, \"I just wanted the scripts to sink\nor swim on their own.\"[17] Miller's script was voted to the 2010 \"Black List\"\nof the 10 best unproduced screenplays then making the rounds in Hollywood.[18]\nThe film is about a teenage girl who must deal with a mysterious uncle\nfollowing the death of her father. Miller described it as a \"horror film, a\nfamily drama and a psychological thriller\".[19] Although influenced by [Bram\nStoker](/wiki/Bram_Stoker \"Bram Stoker\")'s _[Dracula](/wiki/Dracula\n\"Dracula\")_ , Miller has clarified that _Stoker_ is not a vampire\nstory.[19][20] Hitchcock's _[Shadow of a Doubt](/wiki/Shadow_of_a_Doubt\n\"Shadow of a Doubt\")_ also influenced the film but only as a jumping-off\npoint, from which the story takes a different direction.[19] [Park Chan-\nwook](/wiki/Park_Chan-wook \"Park Chan-wook\") directed, with stars [Mia\nWasikowska](/wiki/Mia_Wasikowska \"Mia Wasikowska\") as the teenager, [Nicole\nKidman](/wiki/Nicole_Kidman \"Nicole Kidman\") as the mother, and [Matthew\nGoode](/wiki/Matthew_Goode \"Matthew Goode\") as the uncle.[21] The film was\nreleased in 2013, and received generally positive reviews from critics.[22]\n\nIn July 2014, it was announced that Miller had joined the cast of [The\nCW](/wiki/The_CW \"The CW\") [superhero](/wiki/Superhero_\\(genre\\) \"Superhero\n\\(genre\\)\") series _[The Flash](/wiki/The_Flash_\\(2014_TV_series\\) \"The Flash\n\\(2014 TV series\\)\")_ in a recurring role as [Leonard Snart / Captain\nCold](/wiki/Captain_Cold \"Captain Cold\").[23] He made his first appearance in\nthe fourth episode of the first season, and reprised his role on _[Legends of\nTomorrow](/wiki/Legends_of_Tomorrow \"Legends of Tomorrow\")_.[24] These shows\nreunited him with his _Prison Break_ co-star [Dominic\nPurcell](/wiki/Dominic_Purcell \"Dominic Purcell\"), who portrayed [Mick Rory /\nHeat Wave](/wiki/Heat_Wave_\\(comics\\) \"Heat Wave \\(comics\\)\"). Miller exited\n_Legends of Tomorrow_ as a series regular at the end of season one, but signed\na contract with [Warner Bros. TV](/wiki/Warner_Bros._TV \"Warner Bros.

You only cry for help if\nyou believe there's help to cry for.\"[32] He discussed struggling in Hollywood\nas a closeted actor, and talked about how his involvement in the [ManKind\nProject](/wiki/ManKind_Project \"ManKind Project\") helped him learn about\nbrotherhood, sisterhood, and being part of a community.[33]\n\nIn a 2016 Facebook post, he revealed that he \"[had] struggled with depression\nsince childhood.
