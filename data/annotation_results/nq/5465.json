Selznick](/wiki/David_O._Selznick \"David O.\nSelznick\") of [Selznick International\nPictures](/wiki/Selznick_International_Pictures \"Selznick International\nPictures\") and directed by [Victor Fleming](/wiki/Victor_Fleming \"Victor\nFleming\"). Set in the [American South](/wiki/American_South \"American South\")\nagainst the backdrop of the [American Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War\n\"American Civil War\") and the [Reconstruction\nera](/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States \"Reconstruction Era of the\nUnited States\"), the film tells the story of [Scarlett\nO'Hara](/wiki/Scarlett_O%27Hara \"Scarlett O'Hara\"), the strong-willed daughter\nof a Georgia plantation owner, from her romantic pursuit of [Ashley\nWilkes](/wiki/Ashley_Wilkes \"Ashley Wilkes\"), who is married to his cousin,\n[Melanie Hamilton](/wiki/Melanie_Hamilton \"Melanie Hamilton\"), to her marriage\nto [Rhett Butler](/wiki/Rhett_Butler \"Rhett Butler\"). The leading roles are\nplayed by [Vivien Leigh](/wiki/Vivien_Leigh \"Vivien Leigh\") (Scarlett), [Clark\nGable](/wiki/Clark_Gable \"Clark Gable\") (Rhett), [Leslie\nHoward](/wiki/Leslie_Howard_\\(actor\\) \"Leslie Howard \\(actor\\)\") (Ashley), and\n[Olivia de Havilland](/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland \"Olivia de Havilland\")\n(Melanie).\n\nProduction was difficult from the start. Filming was delayed for two years\nbecause of Selznick's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett\nButler, and the \"search for Scarlett\" led to 1,400 women being interviewed for\nthe part. The original screenplay was written by [Sidney\nHoward](/wiki/Sidney_Howard \"Sidney Howard\") and underwent many revisions by\nseveral writers in an attempt to get it down to a suitable length. The\noriginal director, [George Cukor](/wiki/George_Cukor \"George Cukor\"), was\nfired shortly after filming began and was replaced by Fleming, who in turn was\nbriefly replaced by [Sam Wood](/wiki/Sam_Wood \"Sam Wood\") while Fleming took\nsome time off because he was exhausted.\n\nThe film received positive reviews upon its release, in December 1939,\nalthough some reviewers found it overlong. The casting was widely praised, and\nmany reviewers found Leigh especially suited to her role as Scarlett. At the\n[12th Academy Awards](/wiki/12th_Academy_Awards \"12th Academy Awards\"), it\nreceived ten [Academy Awards](/wiki/Academy_Awards \"Academy Awards\") (eight\ncompetitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for [Best\nPicture](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture \"Academy Award for Best\nPicture\"), [Best Director](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director \"Academy\nAward for Best Director\") (Fleming), [Best Adapted\nScreenplay](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay \"Academy Award for\nBest Adapted Screenplay\") (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), [Best\nActress](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress \"Academy Award for Best\nActress\") (Leigh), and [Best Supporting\nActress](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress \"Academy Award for\nBest Supporting Actress\") ([Hattie McDaniel](/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel \"Hattie\nMcDaniel\"), becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award). It\nset records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time. The film\nwas immensely popular, becoming the [highest-earning film made up to that\npoint](/wiki/Timeline_of_highest-grossing_films \"Timeline of highest-grossing\nfilms\"), and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When [adjusted\nfor monetary inflation](/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_\\(economics\\) \"Real\nversus nominal value \\(economics\\)\"), it is still the [most successful film in\nbox-office history](/wiki/List_of_highest-\ngrossing_films_adjusted_for_inflation \"List of highest-grossing films adjusted\nfor inflation\").\n\n_Gone with the Wind_ has been criticized as historical revisionism glorifying\nslavery, and it has been credited with triggering changes in the way in which\nAfrican Americans are depicted cinematically. It was re-released periodically\nthroughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film\nis regarded as one of [the greatest films of all\ntime](/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_best \"List of films considered the\nbest\"); it has placed in the top ten of the [American Film\nInstitute](/wiki/American_Film_Institute \"American Film Institute\")'s list of\nthe [top 100 American\nfilms](/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies_\\(10th_Anniversary_Edition\\)\n\"AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies \\(10th Anniversary Edition\\)\") since the list's\n[inception, in 1998](/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies \"AFI's 100\nYears...100 Movies\"); and, in 1989, the United States [Library of\nCongress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library of Congress\") selected it for\npreservation in the [National Film Registry](/wiki/National_Film_Registry\n\"National Film Registry\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Plot\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Casting\n    * 3.2 Screenplay\n    * 3.3 Filming\n    * 3.4 Music\n  * 4 Release\n    * 4.1 Preview, premiere and initial release\n    * 4.2 Later releases\n    * 4.3 Television and home video\n  * 5 Reception\n    * 5.1 Critical response\n    * 5.2 Academy Awards\n    * 5.3 Reactions from African-Americans\n    * 5.4 Audience response\n    * 5.5 Critical re-evaluation\n    * 5.6 Industry recognition\n  * 6 Analysis\n    * 6.1 Racial criticism\n    * 6.2 Depiction of marital rape\n  * 7 Legacy\n    * 7.1 In popular culture\n    * 7.2 Sequel\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nPlot[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Plot\")]\n\nPart 1\n\nOn the eve of the [American Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American\nCivil War\") in 1861, [Scarlett O'Hara](/wiki/Scarlett_O%27Hara \"Scarlett\nO'Hara\") lives at [Tara](/wiki/Tara_\\(plantation\\) \"Tara \\(plantation\\)\"), her\nfamily's [cotton plantation](/wiki/Cotton_plantation \"Cotton plantation\") in\n[Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._state\\) \"Georgia \\(U.S. state\\)\"), with her\nparents and two sisters.

As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger\nbrother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett\nconsents and they are married before he leaves to fight.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Gone_With_the_Wind_Poster_1939.jpg/220px-\nGone_With_the_Wind_Poster_1939.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gone_With_the_Wind_Poster_1939.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gone_With_the_Wind_Poster_1939.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nScarlett and Rhett at the charity dance\n\nScarlett is widowed when Charles dies from a bout of\n[pneumonia](/wiki/Pneumonia \"Pneumonia\") and [measles](/wiki/Measles\n\"Measles\") while serving in the [Confederate Army](/wiki/Confederate_Army\n\"Confederate Army\"). Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in\n[Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta \"Atlanta\") to cheer her up, although the O'Haras'\noutspoken housemaid Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to\nwait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in\nmourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets\nRhett again, now a [blockade runner](/wiki/Blockade_runner \"Blockade runner\")\nfor the [Confederacy](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States\nof America\"). Celebrating a Confederate victory and to raise money for the\nConfederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with\nthem. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the\ndisapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.\n\nThe tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the [Battle of\nGettysburg](/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg \"Battle of Gettysburg\") in which many\nof the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful\nappeal to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas [furlough](/wiki/Furlough\n\"Furlough\"), although they do share a private and passionate kiss in the\nparlor on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.\n\nEight months later, as the city is besieged by the [Union\nArmy](/wiki/Union_Army \"Union Army\") in the [Atlanta\nCampaign](/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign \"Atlanta Campaign\"), Scarlett and her young\nhouse slave Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical assistance\nafter she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to\ntake her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in\na horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight,\nleaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her\nreturn home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters,\nand two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has\njust died of [typhoid fever](/wiki/Typhoid_fever \"Typhoid fever\") and her\nfather has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the\nfields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her\nfamily and herself.\n\nPart 2\n\nAs the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father is killed after he\nis thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase away a\n[scalawag](/wiki/Scalawag \"Scalawag\") from his land. With the defeat of the\nConfederacy Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When\nScarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and\nkisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the\ntaxes on Tara implemented by [Reconstructionists](/wiki/Reconstruction_Era\n\"Reconstruction Era\"), Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fiancé, the\nmiddle-aged and wealthy mill owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying\nSuellen got tired of waiting and married another\n[beau](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beau \"wikt:beau\").\n\nFrank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a\n[shanty town](/wiki/Shanty_town \"Shanty town\") after Scarlett is attacked\nwhile driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's\nfuneral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a\ndaughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley\nand chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she\nwants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.\n\nOne day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's\nsister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly\nspreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces\nScarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley; incapable of believing\nanything bad of her beloved sister-in-law, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side\nso that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning\nhome from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue\nabout Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to\nhave sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the\nbedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a\ndivorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett\nreturns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is\npregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of\nstairs and suffering a [miscarriage](/wiki/Miscarriage \"Miscarriage\"). As she\nis recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a\nfence with her pony.\n\nScarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from\na new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett returns\nto their home in Atlanta; realizing that Ashley only ever truly loved Melanie,\nScarlett dashes after Rhett to find him preparing to leave for good. She\npleads with him, telling him she realizes now that it was him she loved all\nalong and never really Ashley, but Rhett says they lost any chance at\nreconciliation after Bonnie’s death. Scarlett begs him to stay but Rhett\nrebuffs her and walks out the door and into the early morning fog, leaving her\nweeping on the staircase and vowing to one day win back his love.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\nDespite receiving top-[billing](/wiki/Billing_\\(filmmaking\\) \"Billing\n\\(filmmaking\\)\") in the [opening credits](/wiki/Opening_credits \"Opening\ncredits\"), Gable—along with Leigh, Howard, and de Havilland who receive\nsecond, third and fourth billing respectively—has a relatively low placing in\nthe [cast list](/wiki/Cast_list \"Cast list\"), due to its unusual structure.\nRather than ordered by conventional billing, the cast is broken down into\nthree sections: the Tara plantation, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta. The cast's\nnames are ordered according to the social rank of the characters; therefore\nThomas Mitchell, who plays Gerald O'Hara, leads the cast list as the head of\nthe O'Hara family, while Barbara O'Neil as his wife receives the second credit\nand Vivien Leigh as the eldest daughter the third credit, despite having the\nmost screen time. Similarly, Howard C. Hickman as John Wilkes is credited over\nLeslie Howard who plays his son, and Clark Gable, who plays only a visitor at\nTwelve Oaks, receives a relatively low credit in the cast list, despite being\npresented as the \"[star](/wiki/Movie_star \"Movie star\")\" of the film in all\nthe promotional literature.[1] Following the death of Mary Anderson—who played\nMaybelle Merriwether—in April 2014, there are only two surviving credited cast\nmembers from the film: Olivia de Havilland who played Melanie Wilkes and\nMickey Kuhn, who played her son Beau Wilkes.[3]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Clark_Gable_as_Rhett_Butler_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg/100px-\nClark_Gable_as_Rhett_Butler_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg)](/wiki/File:Clark_Gable_as_Rhett_Butler_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg)\n\nClark Gable\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Vivien_Leigh_as_Scarlett_OHara_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg/100px-\nVivien_Leigh_as_Scarlett_OHara_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg)](/wiki/File:Vivien_Leigh_as_Scarlett_OHara_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg)\n\nVivien Leigh\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Leslie_Howard_as_Ashley_Wilkes_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg/100px-\nLeslie_Howard_as_Ashley_Wilkes_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg)](/wiki/File:Leslie_Howard_as_Ashley_Wilkes_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg)\n\nLeslie Howard\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Olivia_de_Havilland_as_Melanie_Hamilton_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg/100px-\nOlivia_de_Havilland_as_Melanie_Hamilton_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg)](/wiki/File:Olivia_de_Havilland_as_Melanie_Hamilton_in_Gone_With_the_Wind_trailer.jpg)\n\nOlivia de Havilland\n\nTara plantation\n\n  * [Thomas Mitchell](/wiki/Thomas_Mitchell_\\(actor\\) \"Thomas Mitchell \\(actor\\)\") as Gerald O'Hara\n  * [Barbara O'Neil](/wiki/Barbara_O%27Neil \"Barbara O'Neil\") as Ellen O'Hara (his wife)\n  * [Vivien Leigh](/wiki/Vivien_Leigh \"Vivien Leigh\") as [Scarlett O'Hara](/wiki/Scarlett_O%27Hara \"Scarlett O'Hara\") (daughter)\n  * [Evelyn Keyes](/wiki/Evelyn_Keyes \"Evelyn Keyes\") as Suellen O'Hara (daughter)\n  * [Ann Rutherford](/wiki/Ann_Rutherford \"Ann Rutherford\") as Carreen O'Hara (daughter)\n  * [George Reeves](/wiki/George_Reeves \"George Reeves\") as Brent Tarleton (actually as Stuart)[nb 2]\n  * [Fred Crane](/wiki/Fred_Crane_\\(actor\\) \"Fred Crane \\(actor\\)\") as Stuart Tarleton (actually as Brent)[nb 2]\n  * [Hattie McDaniel](/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel \"Hattie McDaniel\") as Mammy (house servant)\n  * [Oscar Polk](/wiki/Oscar_Polk \"Oscar Polk\") as Pork (house servant)\n  * [Butterfly McQueen](/wiki/Butterfly_McQueen \"Butterfly McQueen\") as Prissy (house servant)\n  * [Victor Jory](/wiki/Victor_Jory \"Victor Jory\") as Jonas Wilkerson (field overseer)\n  * [Everett Brown](/wiki/Everett_Brown \"Everett Brown\") as Big Sam (field foreman)\n\nAt Twelve Oaks\n\n  * [Howard Hickman](/wiki/Howard_Hickman \"Howard Hickman\") as John Wilkes\n  * [Alicia Rhett](/wiki/Alicia_Rhett \"Alicia Rhett\") as [India Wilkes](/wiki/India_Wilkes \"India Wilkes\") (his daughter)\n  * [Leslie Howard](/wiki/Leslie_Howard_\\(actor\\) \"Leslie Howard \\(actor\\)\") as [Ashley Wilkes](/wiki/Ashley_Wilkes \"Ashley Wilkes\") (his son)\n  * [Olivia de Havilland](/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland \"Olivia de Havilland\") as [Melanie Hamilton](/wiki/Melanie_Hamilton \"Melanie Hamilton\") (their cousin)\n  * [Rand Brooks](/wiki/Rand_Brooks \"Rand Brooks\") as [Charles Hamilton](/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(novel\\)#Other_characters \"Gone with the Wind \\(novel\\)\") (Melanie's brother)\n  * [Carroll Nye](/wiki/Carroll_Nye \"Carroll Nye\") as Frank Kennedy (a guest)\n  * [Clark Gable](/wiki/Clark_Gable \"Clark Gable\") as [Rhett Butler](/wiki/Rhett_Butler \"Rhett Butler\") (a visitor from Charleston)\n\nIn Atlanta\n\n  * [Laura Hope Crews](/wiki/Laura_Hope_Crews \"Laura Hope Crews\") as Aunt Pittypat Hamilton\n  * [Eddie Anderson](/wiki/Eddie_%22Rochester%22_Anderson \"Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson\") as Uncle Peter (her coachman)\n  * [Harry Davenport](/wiki/Harry_Davenport_\\(actor\\) \"Harry Davenport \\(actor\\)\") as Doctor Meade\n  * [Leona Roberts](/wiki/Leona_Roberts \"Leona Roberts\") as Mrs. Meade\n  * [Jane Darwell](/wiki/Jane_Darwell \"Jane Darwell\") as Mrs. Merriwether\n  * [Ona Munson](/wiki/Ona_Munson \"Ona Munson\") as Belle Watling\n\nMinor supporting roles\n\n  * [Paul Hurst](/wiki/Paul_Hurst_\\(actor\\) \"Paul Hurst \\(actor\\)\") as the Yankee deserter\n  * [Cammie King Conlon](/wiki/Cammie_King \"Cammie King\") as Bonnie Blue Butler\n  * [J.

Mayer, offered in August 1938 to provide\nGable and $1,250,000 for half of the film's budget but for a high price:\nSelznick would have to pay Gable's weekly salary, and half the profits would\ngo to MGM while [Loew's, Inc](/wiki/Loews_Cineplex_Entertainment \"Loews\nCineplex Entertainment\")—MGM's parent company—would release the film.[4][7]\n\nThe arrangement to release through MGM meant delaying the start of production\nuntil the end of 1938, when Selznick's distribution deal with [United\nArtists](/wiki/United_Artists \"United Artists\") concluded.[7] Selznick used\nthe delay to continue to revise the script and, more importantly, build\npublicity for the film by [searching for the role of\nScarlett](/wiki/Scarlett_O%27Hara#Searching_for_Scarlett \"Scarlett O'Hara\").\nSelznick began a nationwide [casting call](/wiki/Casting_call \"Casting call\")\nthat interviewed 1,400 unknowns. The effort cost $100,000 and was useless for\nthe film, but created \"priceless\" publicity.[4] Early frontrunners included\n[Miriam Hopkins](/wiki/Miriam_Hopkins \"Miriam Hopkins\") and [Tallulah\nBankhead](/wiki/Tallulah_Bankhead \"Tallulah Bankhead\"), who were regarded as\npossibilities by Selznick prior to the purchase of the film rights; [Joan\nCrawford](/wiki/Joan_Crawford \"Joan Crawford\"), who was signed to MGM, was\nalso considered as a potential pairing with Gable. After a deal was struck\nwith MGM, Selznick held discussions with [Norma Shearer](/wiki/Norma_Shearer\n\"Norma Shearer\")—who was MGM's top female star at the time—but she withdrew\nherself from consideration. [Katharine Hepburn](/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn\n\"Katharine Hepburn\") lobbied hard for the role with the support of her friend,\nGeorge Cukor, who had been hired to direct, but she was vetoed by Selznick who\nfelt she was not right for the part.[7][8][9]\n\nMany famous—or soon-to-be-famous—actresses were considered, but only thirty-\none women were actually screen-tested for Scarlett including [Ardis\nAnkerson](/wiki/Ardis_Ankerson \"Ardis Ankerson\"), [Jean\nArthur](/wiki/Jean_Arthur \"Jean Arthur\"), [Tallulah\nBankhead](/wiki/Tallulah_Bankhead \"Tallulah Bankhead\"), [Diana\nBarrymore](/wiki/Diana_Barrymore \"Diana Barrymore\"), [Joan\nBennett](/wiki/Joan_Bennett \"Joan Bennett\"), [Nancy\nColeman](/wiki/Nancy_Coleman \"Nancy Coleman\"), [Frances Dee](/wiki/Frances_Dee\n\"Frances Dee\"), [Ellen Drew](/wiki/Ellen_Drew \"Ellen Drew\") (as Terry Ray),\n[Paulette Goddard](/wiki/Paulette_Goddard \"Paulette Goddard\"), [Susan\nHayward](/wiki/Susan_Hayward \"Susan Hayward\") (under her real name of Edythe\nMarrenner), [Vivien Leigh](/wiki/Vivien_Leigh \"Vivien Leigh\"), [Anita\nLouise](/wiki/Anita_Louise \"Anita Louise\"), [Haila\nStoddard](/wiki/Haila_Stoddard \"Haila Stoddard\"), [Margaret\nTallichet](/wiki/Margaret_Tallichet \"Margaret Tallichet\"), [Lana\nTurner](/wiki/Lana_Turner \"Lana Turner\") and [Linda\nWatkins](/wiki/Linda_Watkins \"Linda Watkins\").[10] Although Margaret Mitchell\nrefused to publicly name her choice, the actress who came closest to winning\nher approval was Miriam Hopkins, who Mitchell felt was just the right type of\nactress to play Scarlett as written in the book. However, Hopkins was in her\nmid-thirties at the time and was considered too old for the part.[7][8][9]\nFour actresses, including Jean Arthur and Joan Bennett, were still under\nconsideration by December 1938; however, only two finalists, Paulette Goddard\nand Vivien Leigh, were tested in [Technicolor](/wiki/Technicolor\n\"Technicolor\"), both on December 20.[11] Goddard almost won the role, but\ncontroversy over her marriage with [Charlie Chaplin](/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin\n\"Charlie Chaplin\") caused Selznick to change his mind.[4]\n\nSelznick had been quietly considering Vivien Leigh, a young English actress\nwho was still little known in America, for the role of Scarlett since February\n1938 when Selznick saw her in _[Fire Over England](/wiki/Fire_Over_England\n\"Fire Over England\")_ and _[A Yank at Oxford](/wiki/A_Yank_at_Oxford \"A Yank\nat Oxford\")_. Leigh's American agent was the London representative of the\n[Myron Selznick](/wiki/Myron_Selznick \"Myron Selznick\") talent agency (headed\nby David Selznick's brother, one of the owners of Selznick International), and\nshe had requested in February that her name be submitted for consideration as\nScarlett. By the summer of 1938 the Selznicks were negotiating with [Alexander\nKorda](/wiki/Alexander_Korda \"Alexander Korda\"), to whom Leigh was under\ncontract, for her services later that year.[12] Selznick's brother arranged\nfor them to meet for the first time on the night of December 10, 1938, when\nthe burning of Atlanta was filmed. In a letter to his wife two days later,\nSelznick admitted that Leigh was \"the Scarlett dark horse\", and after a series\nof screen tests, her casting was announced on January 13, 1939.[13] Just\nbefore the shooting of the film, Selznick informed newspaper columnist [Ed\nSullivan](/wiki/Ed_Sullivan \"Ed Sullivan\"): \"Scarlett O'Hara's parents were\nFrench and Irish. Identically, Miss Leigh's parents are French and Irish.\"[14]\n\n###\nScreenplay[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Screenplay\")]\n\nOf original screenplay writer [Sidney Howard](/wiki/Sidney_Howard \"Sidney\nHoward\"), film historian Joanne Yeck writes, \"reducing the intricacies of\n_Gone with the Wind '_s epic dimensions was a herculean task ... and Howard's\nfirst submission was far too long, and would have required at least six hours\nof film; ... [producer] Selznick wanted Howard to remain on the set to make\nrevisions ... but Howard refused to leave New England [and] as a result,\nrevisions were handled by a host of local writers\".[15] Selznick dismissed\ndirector George Cukor three weeks into filming and sought out Victor Fleming,\nwho was directing _[The Wizard of Oz](/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_\\(1939_film\\)\n\"The Wizard of Oz \\(1939 film\\)\")_ at the time. Fleming was dissatisfied with\nthe script, so Selznick brought in famed writer [Ben Hecht](/wiki/Ben_Hecht\n\"Ben Hecht\") to rewrite the entire screenplay within five days. Hecht returned\nto Howard's original draft and by the end of the week had succeeded in\nrevising the entire first half of the script. Selznick undertook rewriting the\nsecond half himself but fell behind schedule, so Howard returned to work on\nthe script for one week, reworking several key scenes in part two.[16]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/DavidOSelznick.jpg/170px-\nDavidOSelznick.jpg)](/wiki/File:DavidOSelznick.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:DavidOSelznick.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDavid O. Selznick in 1940\n\n\"By the time of the film's release in 1939, there was some question as to who\nshould receive screen credit,\" writes Yeck. \"But despite the number of writers\nand changes, the final script was remarkably close to Howard's version. The\nfact that Howard's name alone appears on the credits may have been as much a\ngesture to his memory as to his writing, for in 1939 Sidney Howard died at age\n48 in a farm-tractor accident, and before the movie's premiere.\"[15] Selznick,\nin a memo written in October 1939, discussed the film's writing credits:\n\"[Y]ou can say frankly that of the comparatively small amount of material in\nthe picture which is not from the book, most is my own personally, and the\nonly original lines of dialog which are not my own are a few from Sidney\nHoward and a few from Ben Hecht and a couple more from [John Van\nDruten](/wiki/John_Van_Druten \"John Van Druten\"). Offhand I doubt that there\nare ten original words of [Oliver] Garrett's in the whole script. As to\nconstruction, this is about eighty per cent my own, and the rest divided\nbetween [Jo Swerling](/wiki/Jo_Swerling \"Jo Swerling\") and Sidney Howard, with\nHecht having contributed materially to the construction of one sequence.\"[17]\n\nAccording to Hecht biographer, William MacAdams, \"At dawn on Sunday, February\n20, 1939, David Selznick ... and director Victor Fleming shook Hecht awake to\ninform him he was on loan from MGM and must come with them immediately and go\nto work on _Gone with the Wind_ , which Selznick had begun shooting five weeks\nbefore. It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting\nfor a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht was in the\nmiddle of working on the film _[At the Circus](/wiki/At_the_Circus \"At the\nCircus\")_ for the [Marx Brothers](/wiki/Marx_Brothers \"Marx Brothers\").\nRecalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend [Gene\nFowler](/wiki/Gene_Fowler \"Gene Fowler\"), he said he hadn't read the novel but\nSelznick and director Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They would\nact out scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be\nrewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, \"After each scene had been performed and\ndiscussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and\nFleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in\nthis fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day.\nSelznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He\nprovided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had\ncompleted, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic.\"\n\nMacAdams writes, \"It is impossible to determine exactly how much Hecht\nscripted ... In the official credits filed with the [Screen Writers\nGuild](/wiki/Screen_Writers_Guild \"Screen Writers Guild\"), Sidney Howard was\nof course awarded the sole screen credit, but four other writers were appended\n... Jo Swerling for contributing to the treatment, Oliver H. P.

Director [George Cukor](/wiki/George_Cukor\n\"George Cukor\"), with whom Selznick had a long working relationship, and who\nhad spent almost two years in pre-production on _Gone with the Wind_ , was\nreplaced after less than three weeks of shooting.[8][nb 3] Selznick and Cukor\nhad already disagreed over the pace of filming and the script,[8][19] but\nother explanations put Cukor's departure down to Gable's discomfort at working\nwith him. [Emanuel Levy](/wiki/Emanuel_Levy \"Emanuel Levy\"), Cukor's\nbiographer, claimed that Clark Gable had worked Hollywood's gay circuit as a\n[hustler](/wiki/Gigolo \"Gigolo\") and that Cukor knew of his past, so Gable\nused his influence to have him discharged.[21] Vivien Leigh and Olivia de\nHavilland learned of Cukor's firing on the day the Atlanta bazaar scene was\nfilmed, and the pair went to Selznick's office in full costume and implored\nhim to change his mind. [Victor Fleming](/wiki/Victor_Fleming \"Victor\nFleming\"), who was directing _The Wizard of Oz_ , was called in from MGM to\ncomplete the picture, although Cukor continued privately to coach Leigh and De\nHavilland.[16] Another MGM director, [Sam Wood](/wiki/Sam_Wood \"Sam Wood\"),\nworked for two weeks in May when Fleming temporarily left the production due\nto exhaustion. Although some of Cukor's scenes were later reshot, Selznick\nestimated that \"three solid reels\" of his work remained in the picture. As of\nthe end of principal photography, Cukor had undertaken eighteen days of\nfilming, Fleming ninety-three, and Wood twenty-four.[8]\n\nCinematographer [Lee Garmes](/wiki/Lee_Garmes \"Lee Garmes\") began the\nproduction, but on March 11, 1939—after a month of shooting footage that\nSelznick and his associates regarded as \"too dark\"—was replaced with [Ernest\nHaller](/wiki/Ernest_Haller \"Ernest Haller\"), working with Technicolor\ncinematographer [Ray Rennahan](/wiki/Ray_Rennahan \"Ray Rennahan\"). Garmes\ncompleted the first third of the film—mostly everything prior to Melanie\nhaving the baby—but did not receive a credit.[22] Most of the filming was done\non \"[the back forty](/wiki/RKO_Forty_Acres \"RKO Forty Acres\")\" of Selznick\nInternational with all the location scenes being photographed in California,\nmostly in [Los Angeles County](/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California \"Los\nAngeles County, California\") or neighboring [Ventura\nCounty](/wiki/Ventura_County,_California \"Ventura County, California\").[23]\nTara, the fictional Southern plantation house, existed only as a plywood and\npapier-mâché facade built on the Selznick studio lot.[24] For the burning of\nAtlanta, new false facades were built in front of the Selznick backlot's many\nold abandoned sets, and Selznick himself operated the controls for the\nexplosives that burned them down.[4] Sources at the time put the estimated\nproduction costs at $3.85 million, making it the second most expensive film\nmade up to that point, with only _[Ben-Hur](/wiki/Ben-Hur_\\(1925_film\\) \"Ben-\nHur \\(1925 film\\)\")_ (1925) having cost more.[25][nb 4]\n\nAlthough legend persists that the [Hays Office](/wiki/Production_Code\n\"Production Code\") fined Selznick $5,000 for using the word \"damn\" in Butler's\nexit line, in fact the [Motion Picture\nAssociation](/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America \"Motion Picture\nAssociation of America\") board passed an amendment to the Production Code on\nNovember 1, 1939, that forbade use of the words \"hell\" or \"damn\" except when\ntheir use \"shall be essential and required for portrayal, in proper historical\ncontext, of any scene or dialogue based upon historical fact or folklore ...\nor a quotation from a literary work, provided that no such use shall be\npermitted which is intrinsically objectionable or offends good taste.\" With\nthat amendment, the [Production Code\nAdministration](/wiki/Production_Code_Administration \"Production Code\nAdministration\") had no further objection to Rhett's closing line.[27]\n\n###\nMusic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Music\")]\n\n![](data:image/png,%89PNG%0D%0A%1A%0A%00%00%00%0DIHDR%00%00%00%01%00%00%00%01%08%02%00%00%00%90wS%DE%00%00%00%01sRGB%00%AE%CE%1C%E9%00%00%00%09pHYs%00%00%0B%13%00%00%0B%13%01%00%9A%9C%18%00%00%00%07tIME%07%DB%0B%0A%17%041%80%9B%E7%F2%00%00%00%19tEXtComment%00Created%20with%20GIMPW%81%0E%17%00%00%00%0CIDAT%08%D7c%60%60%60%00%00%00%04%00%01'4'%0A%00%00%00%00IEND%AEB%60%82)\n\n[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Tara%27s_Theme.ogg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tara%27s_Theme.ogg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Tara's Theme\" from the film trailer\n\nTo compose the score, Selznick chose [Max Steiner](/wiki/Max_Steiner \"Max\nSteiner\"), with whom he had worked at RKO Pictures in the early 1930s. Warner\nBros.—who had contracted Steiner in 1936—agreed to lend him to Selznick.\nSteiner spent twelve weeks working on the score, the longest period that he\nhad ever spent writing one, and at two hours and thirty-six minutes long it\nwas also the longest that he had ever written. Five orchestrators were hired,\nincluding [Hugo Friedhofer](/wiki/Hugo_Friedhofer \"Hugo Friedhofer\"), Maurice\nde Packh, Bernard Kaun, [Adolph Deutsch](/wiki/Adolph_Deutsch \"Adolph\nDeutsch\") and Reginald Bassett. The score is characterized by two love themes,\none for Ashley's and Melanie's sweet love and another that evokes Scarlett's\npassion for Ashley, though notably there is no Scarlett and Rhett love theme.\nSteiner drew considerably on folk and patriotic music, which included [Stephen\nFoster](/wiki/Stephen_Foster \"Stephen Foster\") tunes such as \"Louisiana\nBelle,\" \"Dolly Day,\" \"Ringo De Banjo,\" \"[Beautiful\nDreamer](/wiki/Beautiful_Dreamer \"Beautiful Dreamer\"),\" \"[Old Folks at\nHome](/wiki/Old_Folks_at_Home \"Old Folks at Home\"),\" and \"Katie Belle,\" which\nformed the basis of Scarlett's theme; other tunes that feature prominently\nare: \"Marching through Georgia\" by [Henry Clay Work](/wiki/Henry_Clay_Work\n\"Henry Clay Work\"), \"[Dixie](/wiki/Dixie_\\(song\\) \"Dixie \\(song\\)\"),\"\n\"[Garryowen](/wiki/Garryowen_\\(air\\) \"Garryowen \\(air\\)\")\" and \"[The Bonnie\nBlue Flag](/wiki/The_Bonnie_Blue_Flag \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\").\" The theme that\nis most associated with the film today is the melody that accompanies Tara,\nthe O'Hara plantation; in the early 1940s, \"Tara's Theme\" formed the musical\nbasis of the song \"My Own True Love\" by [Mack David](/wiki/Mack_David \"Mack\nDavid\"). In all, there are ninety-nine separate pieces of music featured in\nthe score. Due to the pressure of completing on time, Steiner received some\nassistance in composing from Friedhofer, Deutsch and [Heinz\nRoemheld](/wiki/Heinz_Roemheld \"Heinz Roemheld\"), and in addition, two short\ncues—by [Franz Waxman](/wiki/Franz_Waxman \"Franz Waxman\") and [William\nAxt](/wiki/William_Axt \"William Axt\")—were taken from scores in the MGM\nlibrary.[28]\n\n##\nRelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Release\")]\n\n### Preview, premiere and initial\nrelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Preview, premiere and initial release\")]\n\nOn September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, [Irene](/wiki/Irene_Mayer_Selznick\n\"Irene Mayer Selznick\"), investor [John \"Jock\" Whitney](/wiki/Jock_Whitney\n\"Jock Whitney\") and film editor Hal Kern drove out to [Riverside,\nCalifornia](/wiki/Riverside,_California \"Riverside, California\") to preview it\nat the [Fox Theatre](/wiki/Riverside_Fox_Theater \"Riverside Fox Theater\").

An estimated three hundred\nthousand residents and visitors to Atlanta lined the streets for up to seven\nmiles to watch a procession of limousines bring the stars from the airport.\nOnly Leslie Howard and Victor Fleming chose not to attend: Howard had returned\nto England due to the outbreak of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War\nII\"), and Fleming had fallen out with Selznick and declined to attend any of\nthe premieres.[25][31] Hattie McDaniel was also absent, as she and the other\nblack cast members were prevented from attending the premiere due to Georgia's\n[Jim Crow](/wiki/Jim_Crow \"Jim Crow\") laws, which would have kept them from\nsitting with their white colleagues. Upon learning that McDaniel had been\nbarred from the premiere, Clark Gable threatened to boycott the event, but\nMcDaniel convinced him to attend.[32] President [Jimmy\nCarter](/wiki/Jimmy_Carter \"Jimmy Carter\") would later recall it as \"the\nbiggest event to happen in the South in my lifetime.\"[33] Premieres in New\nYork and Los Angeles followed, the latter attended by some of the actresses\nthat had been considered for the part of Scarlett, among them Paulette\nGoddard, Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford.[31]\n\nFrom December 1939 to July 1940, the film played only advance-ticket [road\nshow](/wiki/Roadshow_theatrical_release \"Roadshow theatrical release\")\nengagements at a limited number of theaters at prices upwards of $1—more than\ndouble the price of a regular first-run feature—with MGM collecting an\nunprecedented 70 percent of the box office receipts (as opposed to the typical\n30–35 percent of the period). After reaching saturation as a roadshow, MGM\nrevised its terms to a 50 percent cut and halved the prices, before it finally\nentered general release in 1941 at \"popular\" prices.[34] Along with its\ndistribution and advertising costs, total expenditure on the film was as high\nas $7 million.[31][35]\n\n[![Poster shows Rhett Butler carrying Scarlett O'Hara against a backdrop of\nthe Burning of\nAtlanta](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Gone_With_The_Wind_1967_re-\nrelease.jpg/170px-Gone_With_The_Wind_1967_re-\nrelease.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gone_With_The_Wind_1967_re-release.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gone_With_The_Wind_1967_re-release.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1967 re-release poster\n\n### Later\nreleases[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Later releases\")]\n\nIn 1942, Selznick liquidated his company for tax reasons, and sold his share\nin _Gone with the Wind_ to his business partner, John Whitney, for $500,000.\nIn turn, Whitney sold it on to MGM for $2.8 million, so that the studio owned\nthe film outright.[35] MGM immediately re-released the film in spring\n1942,[16] and again in 1947 and 1954;[8] the 1954 reissue was the first time\nthe film was shown in [widescreen](/wiki/Widescreen \"Widescreen\"),\ncompromising the original [Academy ratio](/wiki/Academy_ratio \"Academy ratio\")\nand cropping the top and bottom to an aspect ratio of 1.75:1.

In 1978,\n[CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") signed a deal worth $35 million to broadcast the film\ntwenty times over as many years.[16][40] [Turner\nEntertainment](/wiki/Turner_Entertainment \"Turner Entertainment\") acquired the\nMGM film library in 1986, but the deal did not include the television rights\nto _Gone with the Wind_ , which were still held by CBS. A deal was struck in\nwhich the rights were returned to Turner Entertainment and CBS's broadcast\nrights to _The Wizard of Oz_ were extended.[16] It was used to launch two\ncable channels owned by [Turner Broadcasting\nSystem](/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System \"Turner Broadcasting System\"):\n[Turner Network Television](/wiki/TNT_\\(U.S._TV_network\\) \"TNT \\(U.S. TV\nnetwork\\)\") (1988) and [Turner Classic Movies](/wiki/Turner_Classic_Movies\n\"Turner Classic Movies\") (1994).[43][44] It debuted on\n[videocassette](/wiki/Videocassette \"Videocassette\") in March 1985, where it\nplaced second in the sales charts,[16] and has since been released on\n[DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\") and [Blu-ray Disc](/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc \"Blu-ray Disc\")\nformats.[37]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\n### Critical\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Critical response\")]\n\nUpon its release, consumer magazines and newspapers generally gave _Gone with\nthe Wind_ excellent reviews.[8] However, while its production values,\ntechnical achievements, and scale of ambition were universally recognized,\nsome reviewers of the time found the film to be too long and dramatically\nunconvincing. [Frank S. Nugent](/wiki/Frank_S._Nugent \"Frank S. Nugent\") for\n_[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ best\nsummed up the general sentiment by acknowledging that while it was the most\nambitious film production made up to that point, it probably was not the\ngreatest film ever made, but he nevertheless found it to be an \"interesting\nstory beautifully told\".[45] Franz Hoellering of _[The\nNation](/wiki/The_Nation \"The Nation\")_ was of the same opinion: \"The result\nis a film which is a major event in the history of the industry but only a\nminor achievement in motion-picture art. There are moments when the two\ncategories meet on good terms, but the long stretches between are filled with\nmere spectacular efficiency.\"[46]\n\n“ | The result is a film which is a major event in the history of the industry but only a minor achievement in motion-picture art. | ”  \n---|---|---  \n— Franz Hoellering, reviewer for _The Nation_  \n  \nWhile the film was praised for its fidelity to the novel,[45] this aspect was\nalso singled out as the main factor in contributing to the lengthy running\ntime.[47] John C. Flinn wrote for _[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_ that Selznick had \"left too much in\", and that as\nentertainment, the film would have benefited if repetitious scenes and dialog\nfrom the latter part of the story had been trimmed.[47] _[The Manchester\nGuardian](/wiki/The_Manchester_Guardian \"The Manchester Guardian\")_ felt that\nthe film's one serious drawback was that the story lacked the epic quality to\njustify the outlay of time and found the second half, which focuses on\nScarlett's \"irrelevant marriages\" and \"domestic squabbles,\" mostly\nsuperfluous, and the sole reason for their inclusion had been \"simply because\nMargaret Mitchell wrote it that way\". _The Guardian_ believed that if \"the\nstory had been cut short and tidied up at the point marked by the interval,\nand if the personal drama had been made subservient to a cinematic treatment\nof the central theme—the collapse and devastation of the Old South—then _Gone\nWith the Wind_ might have been a really great film.\"[48] Likewise, Hoellering\nalso found the second half of the film to be weaker than the first half:\nidentifying the Civil War to be the driving force of the first part while the\ncharacters dominate in the second part, he concluded this is where the main\nfault of the picture lay, commenting that \"the characters alone do not\nsuffice\". Despite many excellent scenes, he considered the drama to be\nunconvincing and that the \"psychological development\" had been neglected.[46]\n\nMuch of the praise was reserved for the casting, with Vivien Leigh in\nparticular being singled out for her performance as Scarlett. Nugent described\nher as the \"pivot of the picture\" and believed her to be \"so perfectly\ndesigned for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role\nwould be inconceivable\".[45] Similarly, Hoellering found her \"perfect\" in\n\"appearance and movements\"; he felt her acting best when she was allowed to\n\"accentuate the split personality she portrays\" and thought she was\nparticularly effective in such moments of characterization like the morning\nafter the marital rape scene.[46] Flinn also found Leigh suited to the role\nphysically and felt she was best in the scenes where she displays courage and\ndetermination, such as the escape from Atlanta and when Scarlett kills a\nYankee deserter.[47] Leigh won in the Best Actress category for her\nperformance at the [1939 New York Film Critics Circle\nAwards](/wiki/1939_New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Awards \"1939 New York Film\nCritics Circle Awards\").[49] Of Clark Gable's performance as Rhett Butler,\nFlinn felt the characterization was \"as close to Miss Mitchell's\nconception—and the audience's—as might be imagined\",[47] a view which Nugent\nconcurred with,[45] although Hoellering felt that Gable didn't quite convince\nin the closing scenes, as Rhett walks out on Scarlett in disgust.[46] Of the\nother principal cast members, both Hoellering and Flinn found Leslie Howard to\nbe \"convincing\" as the weak-willed Ashley, with Flinn identifying Olivia de\nHavilland as a \"standout\" as Melanie;[46][47] Nugent was also especially taken\nwith de Havilland's performance, describing it as a \"gracious, dignified,\ntender gem of characterization\".[45] Hattie McDaniel's performance as Mammy\nwas singled out for praise by many critics: Nugent believed she gave the best\nperformance in the film after Vivien Leigh,[45] with Flinn placing it third\nafter Leigh's and Gable's performances.[47]\n\n### Academy\nAwards[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Academy Awards\")]\n\nAt the [12th Academy Awards](/wiki/12th_Academy_Awards \"12th Academy Awards\"),\n_Gone with the Wind_ set a record for [Academy Award](/wiki/Academy_Award\n\"Academy Award\") wins and nominations, winning in eight of the competitive\ncategories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations.

[Carlton Moss](/wiki/Carlton_Moss \"Carlton\nMoss\"), a black dramatist, complained in an open letter that whereas _[The\nBirth of a Nation](/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation \"The Birth of a Nation\")_ was a\n\"frontal attack on American history and the Negro people\", _Gone with the\nWind_ was a \"rear attack on the same\". He went on to dismiss it as a\n\"nostalgic plea for sympathy for a still living cause of Southern reaction\".\nMoss further criticized the stereotypical black characterizations, such as the\n\"shiftless and dull-witted Pork\", the \"indolent and thoroughly irresponsible\nPrissy\", Big Sam's \"radiant acceptance of slavery\", and Mammy with her\n\"constant haranguing and doting on every wish of Scarlett\".[57] Following\nHattie McDaniel's Oscar win, [Walter Francis White](/wiki/Walter_Francis_White\n\"Walter Francis White\"), leader of the [National Association for the\nAdvancement of Colored\nPeople](/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People\n\"National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\"), accused her of\nbeing an [Uncle Tom](/wiki/Uncle_Tom \"Uncle Tom\"). McDaniel responded that she\nwould \"rather make seven hundred dollars a week playing a maid than seven\ndollars being one\"; she further questioned White's qualification to speak on\nbehalf of blacks, since he was light-skinned and only one-eighth black.[56]\n\nOpinion in the black community was generally divided upon release, with the\nfilm being called by some a \"weapon of terror against black America\" and an\ninsult to black audiences, and demonstrations were held in various cities.[56]\nEven so, some sections of the black community recognized McDaniel's\nachievements to be representative of progression: some African-Americans\ncrossed picket lines and praised McDaniel's warm and witty characterization,\nwhile others hoped that the industry's recognition of her work would lead to\nincreased visibility on screen for other black actors. In its editorial\ncongratulation to McDaniel on winning her Academy Award, _[Opportunity: A\nJournal of Negro Life](/wiki/Opportunity:_A_Journal_of_Negro_Life\n\"Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life\")_ used the film as reminder of the\n\"limit\" put on black aspiration by old prejudices.[56][57] [Malcolm\nX](/wiki/Malcolm_X \"Malcolm X\") would later recall that \"when Butterfly\nMcQueen went into her act, I felt like crawling under the rug\".[58]\n\n### Audience\nresponse[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Audience response\")]\n\nUpon its release, _Gone with the Wind_ broke attendance records everywhere.

It generated a box-office gross of $68 million,\nmaking it MGM's most lucrative picture after _[Doctor\nZhivago](/wiki/Doctor_Zhivago_\\(film\\) \"Doctor Zhivago \\(film\\)\")_ from the\nlatter half of the decade.[68] MGM earned a rental of $41 million from the\nrelease,[69] with the U.S. and Canadian share amounting to over $30 million,\nplacing it second only to _[The Graduate](/wiki/The_Graduate \"The Graduate\")_\nfor that year.[62][69] Including its $6.7 million rental from the 1961\nreissue,[70] it was the fourth highest-earner of the decade in the North\nAmerican market, with only _The Sound of Music_ , _The Graduate_ and _Doctor\nZhivago_ making more for their distributors.[62] A further re-release in 1971\nallowed it to briefly recapture the record from _The Sound of Music_ ,\nbringing its total worldwide gross rental to about $116 million by the end of\n1971—more than trebling its earnings from its initial release—before losing\nthe record again the following year to _[The Godfather](/wiki/The_Godfather\n\"The Godfather\")_.[40][71]\n\nAcross all releases, it is estimated that _Gone with the Wind_ has sold over\n[200 million tickets in the United States and Canada](/wiki/List_of_highest-\ngrossing_films_in_Canada_and_the_United_States_adjusted_for_inflation \"List of\nhighest-grossing films in Canada and the United States adjusted for\ninflation\"),[59] generating more theater admissions in that territory than any\nother film.[72] The film was phenomenally successful in [Western\nEurope](/wiki/Western_Europe \"Western Europe\") too, generating approximately\n[35 million tickets in the United Kingdom](/wiki/List_of_highest-\ngrossing_films_in_the_United_Kingdom_by_box-office_admissions \"List of\nhighest-grossing films in the United Kingdom by box-office admissions\") and\nover [16 million in France](/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_France\n\"List of highest-grossing films in France\"), respectively becoming the biggest\nand sixth-biggest ticket-sellers in those markets.[73][74][75] In total, _Gone\nwith the Wind_ has grossed over $390 million globally at the box office;[76]\nin 2007 Turner Entertainment estimated the gross to be equivalent to\napproximately $3.3 billion when adjusted for [inflation](/wiki/Inflation\n\"Inflation\") to current prices,[9] while _[Guinness World\nRecords](/wiki/Guinness_World_Records \"Guinness World Records\")_ arrived at a\nfigure of $3.44 billion in 2014, making it the [most successful film in cinema\nhistory](/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_adjusted_for_inflation \"List of\nhighest-grossing films adjusted for inflation\").[77]\n\nThe film remains immensely popular with audiences into the 21st century,\nhaving been [voted the most popular\nfilm](/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_best#Audience_polls \"List of films\nconsidered the best\") in two nationwide polls of Americans undertaken by\n[Harris Interactive](/wiki/Harris_Interactive \"Harris Interactive\") in 2008,\nand again in 2014.

Schlesinger, Jr.\")\nnoted that Hollywood films generally age well, revealing an unexpected depth\nor integrity, but in the case of _Gone with the Wind_ time has not treated it\nkindly.[81] [Richard Schickel](/wiki/Richard_Schickel \"Richard Schickel\")\nposits that one measure of a film's quality is to ask what you can remember of\nit, and the film falls down in this regard: unforgettable imagery and dialogue\nare simply not present.[82] [Stanley Kauffmann](/wiki/Stanley_Kauffmann\n\"Stanley Kauffmann\"), likewise, also found the film to be a largely\nforgettable experience, claiming he could only remember two scenes\nvividly.[83] Both Schickel and Schlesinger put this down to it being \"badly\nwritten\", in turn describing the dialogue as \"flowery\" and possessing a\n\"picture postcard\" sensibility.[81][82] Schickel also believes the film fails\nas popular art, in that it has limited rewatch value—a sentiment that\nKauffmann also concurs with, stating that having watched it twice he hopes\n\"never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs\".[82][83]\nBoth Schickel and [Andrew Sarris](/wiki/Andrew_Sarris \"Andrew Sarris\")\nidentify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility\nrather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers\nthe film does not carry a sense of being \"created\" or \"directed\", but rather\nhaving emerged \"steaming from the crowded kitchen\", where the main creative\nforce was a producer's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to\nthe novel as possible.[82][84]\n\nSarris concedes that despite its artistic failings, the film does hold a\nmandate around the world as the \"single most beloved entertainment ever\nproduced\".[84] [Judith Crist](/wiki/Judith_Crist \"Judith Crist\") observes\nthat, kitsch aside, the film is \"undoubtedly still the best and most durable\npiece of popular entertainment to have come off the Hollywood assembly lines\",\nthe product of a showman with \"taste and intelligence\".[85] Schlesinger notes\nthat the first half of the film does have a \"sweep and vigor\" that aspire to\nits epic theme, but—finding agreement with the film's contemporary\ncriticisms—the personal lives take over in the second half, and it ends up\nlosing its theme in unconvincing sentimentality.[81] Kauffmann also finds\ninteresting parallels with _The Godfather_ , which had just replaced _Gone\nwith the Wind_ as the highest-grosser at the time: both were produced from\n\"ultra-American\" best-selling novels, both live within codes of honor that are\nromanticized, and both in essence offer cultural fabrication or\nrevisionism.[83]\n\nThe critical perception of the film has shifted in the intervening years,\nwhich resulted in it being ranked 235th in _[Sight&\nSound](/wiki/Sight_%26_Sound \"Sight & Sound\")_'s prestigious\n[decennial](/wiki/Decennial \"Decennial\") critics poll in 2012,[86] and in 2015\nsixty-two international film critics polled by the [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\")\nvoted it the 97th best American film.[87]\n\n### Industry\nrecognition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Industry recognition\")]\n\nThe film has featured in several high-profile industry polls: in 1977 it was\nvoted the most popular film by the [American Film\nInstitute](/wiki/American_Film_Institute \"American Film Institute\") (AFI), in\na poll of the organization's membership;[8] the AFI also ranked the film\nfourth on its \"[100 Greatest Movies](/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies\n\"AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies\")\" list in 1998,[88] with it slipping down to\nsixth place in

ranked it 322nd in the 2012 edition of the decennial _[Sight&\nSound](/wiki/Sight_%26_Sound \"Sight & Sound\")_ poll,[86] and in 2016 it was\nselected as the ninth best \"directorial achievement\" in

Racial\ncriticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Racial criticism\")]\n\n_Gone with the Wind_ has been criticized as having perpetuated Civil War myths\nand black stereotypes.[94] [David\nReynolds](/wiki/David_Reynolds_\\(English_historian\\) \"David Reynolds \\(English\nhistorian\\)\") writes that \"The white women are elegant, their menfolk noble or\nat least dashing. And, in the background, the black slaves are mostly dutiful\nand content, clearly incapable of an independent existence.\" Reynolds likened\n_Gone with the Wind_ to _The Birth of a Nation_ and other re-imaginings of the\nSouth during the era of segregation, in which white Southerners are portrayed\nas defending traditional values and the issue of slavery is largely\nignored.[58] The film has been described as a \"regression\" that promotes the\nmyth of the black rapist and the honourable and defensive role of the [Ku Klux\nKlan](/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan \"Ku Klux Klan\") during Reconstruction,[95] and as a\n\"social propaganda\" film offering a \"[white\nsupremacist](/wiki/White_supremacist \"White supremacist\")\" view of the\npast.[94] From 1972 to 1996, the [Atlanta Historical\nSociety](/wiki/Atlanta_Historical_Society \"Atlanta Historical Society\") held a\nnumber of _Gone with the Wind_ exhibits, among them a 1994 exhibit titled,\n\"Disputed Territories: _Gone with the Wind_ and Southern Myths\". One of the\nquestions explored by the exhibit was \"How True to Life Were the Slaves in\nGWTW?\" This section showed slave experiences were diverse and concluded that\nthe \"happy darky\" was a myth, as was the belief that all slaves experienced\nviolence and brutality.[96]\n\nW. Bryan Rommel Ruiz has argued that despite factual inaccuracies in its\ndepiction of the Reconstruction period, _Gone with the Wind_ nevertheless\nreflects contemporary interpretations that were common in the early 20th\ncentury. One such viewpoint is reflected in a brief scene in which Mammy fends\noff a leering [freedman](/wiki/Freedman \"Freedman\"): a government official can\nbe heard offering bribes to the emancipated slaves for their votes. The\ninference is taken to be that freedmen are ignorant about politics and\nunprepared for freedom, unwittingly becoming the tools of corrupt\nReconstruction officials. While perpetuating some [Lost\nCause](/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy \"Lost Cause of the Confederacy\")\nmyths, the film makes concessions in regard to others. After the attack on\nScarlett in the shanty town, a group of men including Scarlett's husband\nFrank, Rhett Butler and Ashley raid the town; in the novel they belong to the\nKu Klux Klan, representing the common trope of protecting the white woman's\nvirtue, but the filmmakers consciously neutralize the presence of the Klan in\nthe film by referring to it only as a \"political meeting\".[97]\n\nThomas Cripps reasons that the film in some respects undercuts racial\nstereotypes;[98] in particular, the film created greater engagement between\nHollywood and black audiences,[98] with dozens of movies making small gestures\nin recognition of the emerging trend.[57] Only a few weeks after its initial\nrun, a story editor at Warner wrote a memorandum to [Walter\nWanger](/wiki/Walter_Wanger \"Walter Wanger\") about _Mississippi Belle_ , a\nscript that contained the worst excesses of plantation films, suggesting that\n_Gone with the Wind_ had made the film \"unproducible\". More than any film\nsince _The Birth of a Nation_ , it unleashed a variety of social forces that\nforeshadowed an alliance of white liberals and blacks who encouraged the\nexpectation that blacks would one day achieve equality. According to Cripps,\nthe film eventually became a template for measuring social change.[57]\n\nIn 2017, _Gone with the Wind_ was pulled from the schedule at the [Orpheum\nTheatre](/wiki/Orpheum_Theatre_\\(Memphis\\) \"Orpheum Theatre \\(Memphis\\)\") in\nMemphis, Tennessee after a 34-year run of annual showings due to its perceived\nracially insensitive content.[99][100]\n\n### Depiction of marital\nrape[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Depiction of marital rape\")]\n\nOne of the most notorious and widely condemned scenes in _Gone with the Wind_\ndepicts what is now legally defined as \"[marital rape](/wiki/Marital_rape\n\"Marital rape\")\".[101][102] The scene begins with Scarlett and Rhett at the\nbottom of the staircase, where he begins to kiss her, refusing to be told 'no'\nby the struggling and frightened Scarlett;[103][104] Rhett overcomes her\nresistance and carries her up the stairs to the bedroom,[103][104] where the\naudience is left in no doubt that she will \"get what's coming to her\".[105]\nThe next scene, the following morning, shows Scarlett glowing with barely\nsuppressed sexual satisfaction;[103][104][105] Rhett apologizes for his\nbehavior, blaming it on his drinking.[103] The scene has been accused of\ncombining romance and rape by making them indistinguishable from each\nother,[103] and of reinforcing a notion about [forced\nsex](/wiki/Forced_seduction \"Forced seduction\"): that women secretly enjoy it,\nand it is an acceptable way for a man to treat his wife.[105]\n\n[Molly Haskell](/wiki/Molly_Haskell \"Molly Haskell\") has argued that\nnevertheless, women are mostly uncritical of the scene, and that by and large\nit is consistent with what women have in mind if they [fantasize about being\nraped](/wiki/Rape_fantasy \"Rape fantasy\"). Their fantasies revolve around love\nand romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an\nunwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett to take the initiative and insist on\nhaving sexual intercourse.[106]\n\n##\nLegacy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Legacy\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Photograph_of_First_Archivist_of_the_United_States_R._D._W._Connor_Receiving_Film_%22Gone_With_The_Wind%22_from_Senator_George_of_Georgia_and_Loew%27s_Eastern_Division_Manager_Carter_Barron%2C_1941.tif/lossy-\npage1-220px-\nthumbnail.tif.jpg)](/wiki/File:Photograph_of_First_Archivist_of_the_United_States_R._D._W._Connor_Receiving_Film_%22Gone_With_The_Wind%22_from_Senator_George_of_Georgia_and_Loew%27s_Eastern_Division_Manager_Carter_Barron,_1941.tif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Photograph_of_First_Archivist_of_the_United_States_R._D._W._Connor_Receiving_Film_%22Gone_With_The_Wind%22_from_Senator_George_of_Georgia_and_Loew%27s_Eastern_Division_Manager_Carter_Barron,_1941.tif\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nFirst Archivist of the United States R.

In 1975, her brother, Stephens Mitchell (who assumed\ncontrol of her estate), authorized a sequel to be jointly produced by MGM and\n[Universal Studios](/wiki/Universal_Studios \"Universal Studios\") on a budget\nof $12 million. [Anne Edwards](/wiki/Anne_Edwards \"Anne Edwards\") was\ncommissioned to write the sequel as a novel which would then be adapted into a\nscreenplay, and published in conjunction with the film's release. Edwards\nsubmitted a 775-page manuscript entitled _Tara, The Continuation of Gone with\nthe Wind_ , set between 1872 and 1882 focusing on Scarlett's divorce from\nRhett; MGM was not satisfied with the story and the deal collapsed.[16]\n\nThe idea was revived in the 1990s, when a sequel was finally produced in 1994,\nin the form of a television [miniseries](/wiki/Miniseries \"Miniseries\").\n_[Scarlett](/wiki/Scarlett_\\(TV_miniseries\\) \"Scarlett \\(TV miniseries\\)\")_\nwas based upon [the novel](/wiki/Scarlett_\\(Ripley_novel\\) \"Scarlett \\(Ripley\nnovel\\)\") by [Alexandra Ripley](/wiki/Alexandra_Ripley \"Alexandra Ripley\"),\nitself a sequel to Mitchell's book.
