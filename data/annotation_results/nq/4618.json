Originating in the 17th\ncentury, it is a contraction of _[mistress](/wiki/Mistress_\\(form_of_address\\)\n\"Mistress \\(form of address\\)\")_ , which was used for all women. A period is\nnot used to signify the contraction. Its counterparts are [Mrs.](/wiki/Mrs.\n\"Mrs.\"), usually used only for married women, and [Ms.](/wiki/Ms. \"Ms.\"),\nwhich can be used for married or unmarried women.\n\nThe plural _**Misses**_ may be used, such as in _The Misses Doe_. The\ntraditional French \"**Mesdemoiselles** \" (abbreviation \"**Mlles** \") may also\nbe used as the plural in English language conversation or correspondence. In\nAustralian schools the term miss is used interchangeably with female teacher.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Use as a title (honorific) in the United States\n  * 2 Use alone as a form of address\n  * 3 Other uses\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n## Use as a title (honorific) in the United\nStates[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miss&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Use\nas a title \\(honorific\\) in the United States\")]\n\nThe usage of \"Miss\" as a title in the United States is most frequently seen\nwhen referring to young women, or women whose marital status is unknown.\nThough _Miss_ is less commonly used as a title by unmarried adult\n[women](/wiki/Women \"Women\") in the United States than in the past, some still\nprefer to be referred to as such. Twenty-first century\n[etiquette](/wiki/Etiquette \"Etiquette\") honors an adult woman's personal\npreference of title. However, if the preference is not known, \"Ms.\" is used.\n\"Ms.\" is the preferred choice as the female title in business. It is the\nequivalent to the male title \"Mr.\" as neither is marital status specific.\n\n_Miss_ was formerly the default title for businesswomen, but has largely been\nreplaced by [Ms.](/wiki/Ms. \"Ms.\") in this context. It was a default title for\nactresses _(Miss[Helen Hayes](/wiki/Helen_Hayes \"Helen Hayes\"), Miss [Barbara\nStanwyck](/wiki/Barbara_Stanwyck \"Barbara Stanwyck\"))_ or other celebrities\n_(Miss[Amelia Earhart](/wiki/Amelia_Earhart \"Amelia Earhart\"))_. Such default\nusage has also proved problematic; the poet [Dorothy\nParker](/wiki/Dorothy_Parker \"Dorothy Parker\") was often referred to as _Miss\nParker_ , even though _Parker_ was the name of her first husband and she\nherself preferred _Mrs. Parker_. Later in the century, the use of \"Miss\" or\n\"Mrs.\" became a problem for _The New York Times_ in referring to political\ncandidate [Geraldine Ferraro](/wiki/Geraldine_Ferraro \"Geraldine\nFerraro\")[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_], a married woman who did not use her husband's\nsurname, since _Mrs._ has been used with a woman's maiden name only in limited\ncircumstances in public life before the 1980s.

It is sometimes\nused when addressing a younger adult woman, for example, \"May I help you,\nMiss?\" In the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), the titles\nof \"Ma'am\" or \"Madam\" are sometimes used instead of \"Miss.\" Use of any of\nthese terms implies marital\nstatus.[_[dubious](/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement\n\"Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute\") – [discuss](/wiki/Talk:Miss#Dubious\n\"Talk:Miss\")_] Some take offense to the use of \"Ma'am\" or \"Madam\" because it\nindicates that the speaker thinks the woman being addressed must certainly be\nmarried due to her apparent age, and some take offense to the use of the terms\n\"Ma'am\" or \"Madam\" because of their association with houses of ill repute. On\nthe other hand, addressing a woman as \"Miss\" may be taken as patronizing.\n\n## Other uses[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miss&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Other uses\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-\nnew.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg)|\nThis section **does not[cite](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing\nsources\") any [sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.

This\nform was also used in [upper class](/wiki/Upper_class \"Upper class\")\nhouseholds in some English-speaking countries by [servants](/wiki/Servant\n\"Servant\") to address or refer to the unmarried ladies of the household, and\noccasionally in family-run businesses in the same manner, though more commonly\nit was used to address servants if they were addressed by title at all. This\nis also common with female child-care givers; small children will refer to\ntheir preschool teacher or nanny as \"Miss\" and their first name, regardless of\nmarital status. In some school districts in the United States, this custom\nextends through the early primary school grades.\n\nIn some styles of [etiquette](/wiki/Etiquette\n\"Etiquette\")[_[which?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words \"Wikipedia:Avoid\nweasel words\")_], the eldest daughter of a family was addressed on paper\nsimply as _Miss[Doe](/wiki/John_Doe \"John Doe\")_, with the younger daughters\nbeing addressed as _Miss Jane Doe_ and _Miss Rebecca Doe_. In person, as in\nwhen making introductions, the styling would have been extended to unmarried\ncousins with the same surname.\n\nAnother notable use of _Miss_ is as the title of a [beauty\nqueen](/wiki/Beauty_queen \"Beauty queen\") (given that in most pageants it is a\nrequirement that contestants be unmarried), such as _[Miss\nAmerica](/wiki/Miss_America \"Miss America\")_ , _[Miss World](/wiki/Miss_World\n\"Miss World\")_ , and _[Miss Universe](/wiki/Miss_Universe \"Miss Universe\")_.\nOther languages, such as [French](/wiki/French_language \"French language\"),\n[Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_language \"Spanish language\"),\n[German](/wiki/German_language \"German language\"), and\n[Portuguese](/wiki/Portuguese_language \"Portuguese language\"), have borrowed\nthe English _Miss_ to refer to the winner of a beauty pageant.\n\nIn some Mexican schools (particularly, but not exclusively, in bilingual\nschools), the term _Miss_ and _female teacher_ are used interchangeably;\nstudents often address their female teachers simply as _Miss_.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Miss&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  *
