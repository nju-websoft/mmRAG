An army invading\nfrom [Quebec](/wiki/Quebec \"Quebec\") under [John Burgoyne](/wiki/John_Burgoyne\n\"John Burgoyne\") had surrendered to the Americans under [Horatio\nGates](/wiki/Horatio_Gates \"Horatio Gates\") at the [Battles of\nSaratoga](/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga \"Battles of Saratoga\"), compelling the\n[Kingdom of France](/wiki/Kingdom_of_France \"Kingdom of France\") and\n[Spain](/wiki/Spain \"Spain\") to declare war on [Great\nBritain](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great Britain\") in support\nof the Americans. Meanwhile, a strategic effort led by [Sir William\nHowe](/wiki/William_Howe,_5th_Viscount_Howe \"William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe\")\nto capture the Revolutionary capital of [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia\n\"Philadelphia\") had met with limited success. Having replaced his superior as\nCommander-in-Chief of the American Station, [Sir Henry\nClinton](/wiki/Henry_Clinton_\\(American_War_of_Independence\\) \"Henry Clinton\n\\(American War of Independence\\)\") withdrew all his forces back to [New York\nCity](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") to reinforce the city against a\npossible Franco-American attack.[3]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/CharlestownSC1780.jpg/300px-\nCharlestownSC1780.jpg)](/wiki/File:CharlestownSC1780.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:CharlestownSC1780.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDetail of a 1780 map drawn by a British engineer showing the Charleston\ndefenses\n\nStymied by the [Fabian strategy](/wiki/Fabian_strategy \"Fabian strategy\")\nadopted by [George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\"),\nand, under increasing political pressure to deliver victory, the British\nturned to launching their [\"Southern\nStrategy\"](/wiki/Southern_theatre_of_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Southern\ntheatre of the American Revolutionary War\") for forcing a capitulation of the\nAmericans. The British were persuaded that there was a strong\n[Loyalist](/wiki/Loyalist_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Loyalist \\(American\nRevolution\\)\") sentiment in the south. It was expected that these Loyalists\nwould rise against the American\n[Patriots](/wiki/Patriot_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Patriot \\(American\nRevolution\\)\") in large numbers. The opening British move was the [Capture of\nSavannah](/wiki/Capture_of_Savannah \"Capture of Savannah\"),\n[Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._state\\) \"Georgia \\(U.S. state\\)\") in December\n1778. After repulsing an [assault on Savannah](/wiki/Siege_of_Savannah \"Siege\nof Savannah\") by a combined Franco-American force in October 1779, the British\nplanned to capture [Charleston, South\nCarolina](/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina \"Charleston, South Carolina\"),\nintending to use the city as a base for further operations in the southern\ncolonies.[3]\n\n[Sir Henry Clinton](/wiki/Henry_Clinton_\\(American_War_of_Independence\\)\n\"Henry Clinton \\(American War of Independence\\)\") evacuated [Newport, Rhode\nIsland](/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island \"Newport, Rhode Island\") in Oct. 1779, and\nleft the substantial garrison of [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York\nCity\") under the command of [Wilhelm von\nKnyphausen](/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Knyphausen \"Wilhelm von Knyphausen\"). In\nDecember, the day after Christmas 1779, Clinton and his second in command\n[Charles Cornwallis](/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis\n\"Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis\"), sailed southward with 8,500\ntroops and 5,000 sailors on 90 troopships and 14 warships. After a very stormy\nvoyage, the fleet anchored in Savannah River on 1 Feb. 1780. By 12 Feb.,\nClinton had landed his army 30 miles south of Charleston on [Simmons\nIsland](/wiki/Seabrook_Island,_South_Carolina \"Seabrook Island, South\nCarolina\"). By 24 Feb., the British had crossed the [Stono\nRiver](/wiki/Stono_River \"Stono River\") onto [James\nIsland](/wiki/James_Island,_South_Carolina \"James Island, South Carolina\"),\nand by 10 March, Lord Cornwallis had made it to the mainland. By 22 March,\nthey had advanced to [Middleton Place](/wiki/Middleton_Place \"Middleton\nPlace\") and [Drayton Hall](/wiki/Drayton_Hall \"Drayton Hall\"), and on 29 March\n1780, crossed the [Ashley River](/wiki/Ashley_River_\\(South_Carolina\\) \"Ashley\nRiver \\(South Carolina\\)\").[3]:39–40,42,44\n\n## Siege[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Charleston&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Siege\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Charlestownmap.jpeg/300px-\nCharlestownmap.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Charlestownmap.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charlestownmap.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCharleston map showing the distribution of British forces during the siege\n\nCutting the city off from relief, Clinton began a siege of the city on April\n1, 800 yards from the American fortifications located at today's [Marion\nSquare](/wiki/Marion_Square \"Marion Square\"). Whipple, deciding the\n[bar](/wiki/Mouth_bar \"Mouth bar\") was undefendable, ended up\n[scuttling](/wiki/Scuttling \"Scuttling\") his fleet at the mouth of the [Cooper\nRiver](/wiki/Cooper_River_\\(South_Carolina\\) \"Cooper River \\(South\nCarolina\\)\"). Then Arbuthnot, on 8 April, brought his 14 vessels safely into\nthe harbor, past the roaring guns of [Fort Moultrie](/wiki/Fort_Moultrie \"Fort\nMoultrie\"), the same day Woodford arrived with 750 [Virginia\nContinentals](/wiki/Virginia_Line \"Virginia Line\").[3]:46,52–53,55–57\n\nIn order to consolidate British control of the immediate area, Clinton\ndispatched [Banastre Tarleton](/wiki/Banastre_Tarleton \"Banastre Tarleton\")\nand [Patrick Ferguson](/wiki/Patrick_Ferguson \"Patrick Ferguson\") to capture\n[Monck's Corner](/wiki/Battle_of_Monck%27s_Corner \"Battle of Monck's Corner\")\non 14 April. On 18 April, [Lt. Col. Lord Rawdon](/wiki/Francis_Rawdon-\nHastings,_1st_Marquess_of_Hastings \"Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of\nHastings\") arrived with 2,500 men, including the 42nd Highlanders, the Hessian\nvon Ditfurth Regiment, the Queen's Rangers, Prince of Wales American\nVolunteers, and the Volunteers of Ireland. Charleston was then completely\nsurrounded.[3]:60–64\n\nGovernor [John Rutledge](/wiki/John_Rutledge \"John Rutledge\") escaped on 13\nApril, before Cornwallis crossed the Cooper River, and joined Webster in\nblocking escape from the left bank. On 21 April, Lincoln requested a surrender\nwith \"[Honours of war](/wiki/Honours_of_war \"Honours of war\")\", which was\nrejected by Clinton. On 25 April, civilians led by [Christopher\nGadsden](/wiki/Christopher_Gadsden \"Christopher Gadsden\") prevented any action\non Lincoln's part in withdrawing the Continental regiments. On 6 May, Tarleton\nwon another engagement in the [Battle of Lenud's\nFerry](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenud%27s_Ferry \"Battle of Lenud's Ferry\"), while the\nBritish siege works had advanced far enough towards the Charleston\nfortifications to drain the canal in front.[3]:66–67[4][5][6][7]\n\nOn 7 May, Fort Moultrie surrendered without a fight. On May 8, Clinton called\nfor Lincoln's unconditional surrender, but Lincoln again attempted to\nnegotiate for the honours of war. On May 11, Gadsden and other citizens asked\nLincoln to surrender. While on the same day, the British fired [heated\nshot](/wiki/Heated_shot \"Heated shot\") into the city, burning several homes,\ncompelling Lincoln to call for a parlay to negotiate terms for surrender. On\nMay 12, Lincoln formally surrendered 3,371 men to the British.[3][3]:69–70\n\nWhen word reached the back-country, the American troops holding Ninety-Six and\nCamden also surrendered to the British.[2]\n\n##\nAftermath[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Charleston&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Aftermath\")]\n\n[Prison hulks](/wiki/Prison_hulks \"Prison hulks\") awaited the majority of the\n2,571 Continental prisoners, while [parole](/wiki/Parole \"Parole\") was granted\nto the militia and civilians who promised not to take up arms. However, this\nalso meant there no longer existed an American army in the South.[3]:70\n\nThe British captured some 5,266 prisoners, 311 artillery pieces, 9,178\nartillery rounds, 5,916 muskets, 33,000 rounds of ammunition, 15 Regimental\ncolours, 49 ships and 120 boats, plus 376 barrels of flour, and large\nmagazines of rum, rice and indigo.[2] Following the surrender, the captured\nordnance was brought to a powder magazine. A Hessian officer warned that some\nof the guns might still be loaded, but he was ignored. One prematurely fired,\ndetonating 180 barrels of powder, further discharging 5,000 muskets in the\nmagazine. The accident killed approximately 200 people and destroyed six\nhouses.[2] The prisoners of the siege were diverted to multiple locations,\nincluding prison shops, the old barracks where the [College of\nCharleston](/wiki/College_of_Charleston \"College of Charleston\") is today, and\nthe [Old Exchange and Provost](/wiki/Exchange_and_Provost \"Exchange and\nProvost\") \"Dungeon\".\n\nThe defeat was a serious blow to the American cause.
