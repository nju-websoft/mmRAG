It will be the first\nWorld Cup since [South Korea/Japan in 2002](/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup \"2002\nFIFA World Cup\") that will be hosted by more than one nation. With its past\nhosting of the [1970](/wiki/1970_FIFA_World_Cup \"1970 FIFA World Cup\") and\n[1986](/wiki/1986_FIFA_World_Cup \"1986 FIFA World Cup\") tournaments, Mexico\nwill also become the first country to host all or part of three men's World\nCups.\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will also see the tournament expanded from 32 to 48\nteams.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Format\n    * 1.1 Slot allocation\n      * 1.1.1 Playoff tournament\n    * 1.2 Host selection\n      * 1.2.1 Voting\n  * 2 Qualification\n  * 3 Candidate cities and venues\n    * 3.1 Canada\n    * 3.2 Mexico\n    * 3.3 United States\n  * 4 Controversies\n  * 5 Broadcasting rights\n  * 6 References\n\n## Format[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2026_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Format\")]\n\n[Michel Platini](/wiki/Michel_Platini \"Michel Platini\"), who was then the\n[UEFA](/wiki/UEFA \"UEFA\") [president](/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_UEFA \"List\nof Presidents of UEFA\"), had suggested in October 2013 an expansion of the\ntournament to 40 teams,[4][5] an idea that FIFA president [Gianni\nInfantino](/wiki/Gianni_Infantino \"Gianni Infantino\") also suggested in March\n2016.[6] A desire to increase the number of participants in the tournament\nfrom the previous 32 team format was announced on October 4, 2016. Four\nexpansion options were considered:[7][8][9][10]\n\n  * Expand to 40 teams (8 groups of 5 teams) – 88 matches\n  * Expand to 40 teams (10 groups of 4 teams) – 76 matches\n  * Expand to 48 teams (opening 32-team playoff round) – 80 matches\n  * **Expand to 48 teams (16 groups of 3 teams) – 80 matches**\n\nOn January 10, 2017, the [FIFA Council](/wiki/FIFA_Council \"FIFA Council\")\nvoted unanimously to expand to a 48-team tournament.[3]\n\nThe tournament will open with a group stage consisting of 16 groups of three\nteams, with the top two teams progressing from each group to a [knockout\ntournament](/wiki/Elimination_tournament \"Elimination tournament\") starting\nwith a round of 32 teams.[11] The number of games played overall will increase\nfrom 64 to 80, but the number of games played by finalists remains at seven,\nthe same as with 32 teams, but one group match will be replaced by a knockout\nmatch. The tournament will also be completed within 32 days, the same as\nprevious 32-team tournaments.[12]\n\nThe [European Club Association](/wiki/European_Club_Association \"European Club\nAssociation\") and its member clubs opposed the proposal for expansion, saying\nthat the number of games was already at an \"unacceptable\" level and they urged\nthe governing body to reconsider its idea of increasing the number of teams\nthat qualify.[13] They contended that it was a decision taken for political\nreasons because Infantino would thus satisfy his electorate, rather than for\nsporting reasons.[14] [Liga de Fútbol\nProfesional](/wiki/Liga_de_F%C3%BAtbol_Profesional \"Liga de Fútbol\nProfesional\") president [Javier Tebas](/wiki/Javier_Tebas \"Javier Tebas\")\nagreed, affirming the unacceptability of the new format. He told\n_[Marca](/wiki/Marca_\\(newspaper\\) \"Marca \\(newspaper\\)\")_ that the football\nindustry is maintained thanks to clubs and leagues, not FIFA, and that\nInfantino did politics because to be elected he promised more countries in the\nWorld Cup; he wanted to keep the electoral promises.[15] German national team\ncoach [Joachim Löw](/wiki/Joachim_L%C3%B6w \"Joachim Löw\") warned that\nexpansion, as had occurred for [Euro 2016](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2016 \"UEFA Euro\n2016\"), would dilute the value of the world tournament because players have\nalready reached their physical and mental limit.[16] Another criticism of the\nnew format is that with three-team groups, the risk of collusion between the\ntwo teams playing in the last round of the group stage will increase compared\nwith four-team groups (where simultaneous kick-offs have been employed). One\nsuggestion by president Infantino is that group matches that end in draws will\nbe decided by penalty shootouts.[17]\n\n### Slot\nallocation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2026_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Slot allocation\")]\n\nOn March 30, 2017, the Bureau of the [FIFA Council](/wiki/FIFA_Council \"FIFA\nCouncil\") (composed of the FIFA president and the presidents of each of the\nsix confederations) proposed a slot allocation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nThe recommendation was submitted for the ratification by the [FIFA\nCouncil](/wiki/FIFA_Council \"FIFA Council\").[18][19]\n\nOn May 9, 2017, two days before the 67th [FIFA Congress](/wiki/FIFA_Congress\n\"FIFA Congress\"), the FIFA Council approved the slot allocation in a meeting\nin [Manama](/wiki/Manama \"Manama\"), Bahrain. It includes an intercontinental\nplayoff tournament involving six teams to decide the last two FIFA World Cup\nberths.[20]\n\nConfederation  | FIFA eligible members  | Places in finals  \n(including hosts)  | Percentage of members   \nwith places in finals  | Places before 2026  \n(excluding hosts,  \nincluding half-places)  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[AFC](/wiki/Asian_Football_Confederation \"Asian Football Confederation\") | 46  | 8 | 17% | 4.5   \n[CAF](/wiki/Confederation_of_African_Football \"Confederation of African Football\") | 54  | 9 | 17% | 5   \n[CONCACAF](/wiki/CONCACAF \"CONCACAF\") | 35  | 6 | 17% | 3.5   \n[CONMEBOL](/wiki/CONMEBOL \"CONMEBOL\") | 10  | 6 | 60% | 4.5   \n[OFC](/wiki/Oceania_Football_Confederation \"Oceania Football Confederation\") | 11  | 1 | 9% | 0.5   \n[UEFA](/wiki/UEFA \"UEFA\") | 55  | 16 | 29% | 13   \nPlayoff  | –  | 2 | 33% | –   \nTotal  | 211  | 48 | 23% | 31 (+ hosts)   \n  \nThe issue of how to allocate automatic host country qualification given that\nthere are multiple host countries has not yet been resolved and will be\ndecided by the FIFA council.[18][20][21] The United bid anticipated all three\nhost countries being awarded automatic places.[22]\n\nThe ratification of slot allocation gives\n[OFC](/wiki/Oceania_Football_Confederation \"Oceania Football Confederation\") a\nguaranteed berth in the final tournament for the first time in FIFA World Cup\nhistory. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the first tournament in which all six\nconfederations have guaranteed berths.\n\n#### Playoff\ntournament[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2026_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Playoff tournament\")]\n\nA playoff tournament involving six teams will be held to decide the last two\nFIFA World Cup berths,[18] consisting of one team per confederation (except\nfor [UEFA](/wiki/UEFA \"UEFA\")) and one additional team from the confederation\nof the host country (i.e. [CONCACAF](/wiki/CONCACAF \"CONCACAF\")).\n\nTwo of the teams will be seeded based on the [FIFA World\nRankings](/wiki/FIFA_World_Rankings \"FIFA World Rankings\"), and the seeded\nteams will play for a [FIFA World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup \"FIFA World Cup\")\nberth against the winners of the first two knockout games involving the four\nunseeded teams.\n\nThe tournament is to be played in the host country(ies) and to be used as a\ntest event for the FIFA World Cup. The existing playoff window of November\n2025 has been suggested as a tentative date for the 2026 edition.\n\n### Host\nselection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2026_FIFA_World_Cup&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Host selection\")]\n\nMain articles: [Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup\nbid](/wiki/Morocco_2026_FIFA_World_Cup_bid \"Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid\")\nand [United 2026 FIFA World Cup bid](/wiki/United_2026_FIFA_World_Cup_bid\n\"United 2026 FIFA World Cup bid\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/World_Map_FIFA2.svg/400px-\nWorld_Map_FIFA2.svg.png)](/wiki/File:World_Map_FIFA2.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:World_Map_FIFA2.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMap of the World with the six confederations\n\nThe FIFA Council went back and forth between 2013 and 2017 on limitations\nwithin hosting rotation based on the continental confederations. Originally,\nit was set that bids to be host would not be allowed from countries belonging\nto confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments. It was\ntemporarily changed to only prohibit countries belonging to the confederation\nthat hosted the previous World Cup from bidding to host the following\ntournament,[23] before the rule was changed back to its prior state of two\nWorld Cups. However, the FIFA Council did make an exception to potentially\ngrant eligibility to member associations of the confederation of the second-\nto-last host of the FIFA World Cup in the event that none of the received bids\nfulfill the strict technical and financial requirements.[24][25] In March\n2017, FIFA president [Gianni Infantino](/wiki/Gianni_Infantino \"Gianni\nInfantino\") confirmed that \"Europe ([UEFA](/wiki/UEFA \"UEFA\")) and Asia\n([AFC](/wiki/Asian_Football_Confederation \"Asian Football Confederation\")) are\nexcluded from the bidding following the selection of\n[Russia](/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup \"2018 FIFA World Cup\") and\n[Qatar](/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup \"2022 FIFA World Cup\") in 2018 and 2022\nrespectively.\"[26] Therefore, the 2026 World Cup could be hosted by one of the\nremaining four confederations: [CONCACAF](/wiki/CONCACAF \"CONCACAF\") (North\nAmerica; last hosted in [1994](/wiki/1994_FIFA_World_Cup \"1994 FIFA World\nCup\")), [CAF](/wiki/Confederation_of_African_Football \"Confederation of\nAfrican Football\") (Africa; last hosted in [2010](/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup\n\"2010 FIFA World Cup\")), [CONMEBOL](/wiki/CONMEBOL \"CONMEBOL\") (South America;\nlast hosted in [2014](/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup \"2014 FIFA World Cup\")), or\n[OFC](/wiki/Oceania_Football_Confederation \"Oceania Football Confederation\")\n(Oceania, never hosted before), or potentially by UEFA in case no bid from\nthose four met the requirements.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/World_cup_hosts2.png/220px-\nWorld_cup_hosts2.png)](/wiki/File:World_cup_hosts2.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:World_cup_hosts2.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nAfter the selection, the map of world cup hosts stayed like this.

Also by 2026,\nthe FIFA general secretariat, after consultation with the Competitions\nCommittee, will have the power to exclude bidders who do not meet the minimum\ntechnical requirements to host the competition.[24]\n\nCanada, Mexico and the United States had all publicly considered bidding for\nthe tournament separately, but the United joint bid was announced on April 10,\n2017. The United bid contacted 48 venues in 43 cities (3 venues in 3 cities in\nMexico, 8 venues in 6 cities in Canada and 37 venues in 34 cities in the\nUnited States). This bid was ultimately cut down to 23 venues in 23 cities (3\nin Canada, 3 in Mexico and 17 in the United States; the American venues will\nbe cut down to 10 for a total of 16 venues for the tournament).
