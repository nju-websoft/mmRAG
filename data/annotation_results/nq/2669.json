This may result in coastal upwelling.\n\n**Upwelling** is an [oceanographic](/wiki/Physical_oceanography \"Physical\noceanography\") phenomenon that involves [wind](/wiki/Wind \"Wind\")-driven\nmotion of dense, cooler, and usually [nutrient](/wiki/Nutrient\n\"Nutrient\")-rich water towards the [ocean](/wiki/Ocean \"Ocean\") surface,\nreplacing the warmer, usually nutrient-depleted [surface\nwater](/wiki/Surface_water \"Surface water\"). The nutrient-rich upwelled water\nstimulates the growth and reproduction of [primary\nproducers](/wiki/Primary_producers \"Primary producers\") such as\n[phytoplankton](/wiki/Phytoplankton \"Phytoplankton\"). Due to the\n[biomass](/wiki/Biomass \"Biomass\") of phytoplankton and presence of cool water\nin these regions, upwelling zones can be identified by cool [sea surface\ntemperatures](/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature \"Sea surface temperature\") (SST)\nand high concentrations of [chlorophyll-a](/wiki/Chlorophyll-a\n\"Chlorophyll-a\").[1][2]\n\nThe increased availability of nutrients in upwelling regions results in high\nlevels of [primary production](/wiki/Primary_production \"Primary production\")\nand thus [fishery](/wiki/Fishery \"Fishery\") production. Approximately 25% of\nthe total global [marine fish](/wiki/Marine_fish \"Marine fish\") catches come\nfrom five upwellings that occupy only 5% of the total ocean area.[3]\nUpwellings that are driven by coastal [currents](/wiki/Ocean_current \"Ocean\ncurrent\") or diverging open ocean have the greatest impact on nutrient-\nenriched waters and global fishery yields.[3][4]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Mechanisms\n  * 2 Types\n    * 2.1 Coastal\n      * 2.1.1 Equatorial\n      * 2.1.2 Southern Ocean\n      * 2.1.3 Other sources\n  * 3 Variations\n  * 4 High productivity\n  * 5 Threats to upwelling ecosystems\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Mechanisms[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Mechanisms\")]\n\nThe three main drivers that work together to cause upwelling are\n[wind](/wiki/Wind \"Wind\"), [Coriolis effect](/wiki/Coriolis_effect \"Coriolis\neffect\"), and [Ekman transport](/wiki/Ekman_transport \"Ekman transport\"). They\noperate differently for different types of upwelling, but the general effects\nare the same.[5] In the overall process of upwelling, winds blow across the\nsea surface at a particular direction, which causes a wind-water interaction.\nAs a result of the wind, the water is transported a net of 90 degrees from the\ndirection of the wind due to Coriolis forces and Ekman transport. Ekman\ntransport causes the surface layer of water to move at about a 45 degree angle\nfrom the direction of the wind, and the friction between that layer and the\nlayer beneath it causes the successive layers to move in the same direction.\nThis results in a spiral of water movement down the water column. Then, it is\nthe Coriolis forces that dictate which way the water will move; in the\nNorthern hemisphere, the water is transported to the right of the direction of\nthe wind. In the Southern Hemisphere, the water is transported to the left of\nthe wind.[6] If this net movement of water is divergent, then upwelling of\ndeep water occurs to replace the water that was lost.[1][5]\n\n## Types[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Types\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Upwelling_image1.jpg/220px-\nUpwelling_image1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Upwelling_image1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Upwelling_image1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAreas of upwelling in red\n\nThe major upwellings in the ocean are associated with the divergence of\ncurrents that bring deeper, colder, nutrient rich waters to the surface. There\nare at least five types of upwelling: coastal upwelling, large-scale wind-\ndriven upwelling in the ocean interior, upwelling associated with eddies,\ntopographically-associated upwelling, and broad-diffusive upwelling in the\nocean interior.\n\n### Coastal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Coastal\")]\n\nCoastal upwelling is the best known type of upwelling, and the most closely\nrelated to human activities as it supports some of the most productive\n[fisheries](/wiki/Fisheries \"Fisheries\") in the world. Wind-driven currents\nare diverted to the right of the winds in the Northern Hemisphere and to the\nleft in the Southern Hemisphere due to the [Coriolis\neffect](/wiki/Coriolis_effect \"Coriolis effect\"). The result is a net movement\nof surface water at right angles to the direction of the wind, known as the\n[Ekman transport](/wiki/Ekman_transport \"Ekman transport\") (See also [Ekman\nSpiral](/wiki/Ekman_Spiral \"Ekman Spiral\")). When Ekman transport is occurring\naway from the coast, surface waters moving away are replaced by deeper,\ncolder, and denser water.[4] Normally, this upwelling process occurs at a rate\nof about 5–10 meters per day, but the rate and proximity of upwelling to the\ncoast can be changed due to the strength and distance of the wind.[1][7]\n\nDeep waters are rich in nutrients, including [nitrate](/wiki/Nitrate\n\"Nitrate\"), [phosphate](/wiki/Phosphate \"Phosphate\") and [silicic\nacid](/wiki/Silicic_acid \"Silicic acid\"), themselves the result of\n[decomposition](/wiki/Decomposition \"Decomposition\") of sinking [organic\nmatter](/wiki/Organic_matter \"Organic matter\") (dead/detrital plankton) from\nsurface waters. When brought to the surface, these nutrients are utilized by\n[phytoplankton](/wiki/Phytoplankton \"Phytoplankton\"), along with dissolved CO2\n([carbon dioxide](/wiki/Carbon_dioxide \"Carbon dioxide\")) and light energy\nfrom the [sun](/wiki/Sun \"Sun\"), to produce [organic\ncompounds](/wiki/Organic_compound \"Organic compound\"), through the process of\n[photosynthesis](/wiki/Photosynthesis \"Photosynthesis\"). Upwelling regions\ntherefore result in very high levels of primary production (the amount of\ncarbon fixed by [phytoplankton](/wiki/Phytoplankton \"Phytoplankton\")) in\ncomparison to other areas of the ocean. They account for about 50% of global\nmarine productivity.[8] High primary production propagates up the [food\nchain](/wiki/Food_chain \"Food chain\") because\n[phytoplankton](/wiki/Phytoplankton \"Phytoplankton\") are at the base of the\noceanic food chain.[9]\n\nThe food chain follows the course of:\n\n  * Phytoplankton → [Zooplankton](/wiki/Zooplankton \"Zooplankton\") → Predatory zooplankton → [Filter feeders](/wiki/Filter_feeders \"Filter feeders\") → Predatory fish [4] → Marine birds, marine mammals [10]\n\nWorldwide, there are five major coastal currents associated with upwelling\nareas: the [Canary Current](/wiki/Canary_Current \"Canary Current\") (off\n[Northwest Africa](/wiki/Northwest_Africa \"Northwest Africa\")), the [Benguela\nCurrent](/wiki/Benguela_Current \"Benguela Current\") (off [southern\nAfrica](/wiki/Southern_Africa \"Southern Africa\")), the [California\nCurrent](/wiki/California_Current \"California Current\") (off\n[California](/wiki/California \"California\") and [Oregon](/wiki/Oregon\n\"Oregon\")), the [Humboldt Current](/wiki/Humboldt_Current \"Humboldt Current\")\n(off [Peru](/wiki/Peru \"Peru\") and [Chile](/wiki/Chile \"Chile\")), and the\n[Somali Current](/wiki/Somali_Current \"Somali Current\") (off\n[Somalia](/wiki/Somalia \"Somalia\") and [Oman](/wiki/Oman \"Oman\")). All of\nthese currents support major fisheries. The four major eastern boundary\ncurrents in which coastal upwelling primarily occurs are the Canary Current,\nBenguela Current, California Current, and Humboldt Current.[11] The [Benguela\nCurrent](/wiki/Benguela_Current \"Benguela Current\") is the eastern boundary of\nthe [South Atlantic subtropical gyre](/wiki/South_Atlantic_Gyre \"South\nAtlantic Gyre\") and can be divided into a northern and southern sub-system\nwith upwelling occurring in both areas. The subsystems are divided by an area\nof permanent upwelling off of [Luderitz](/wiki/Luderitz \"Luderitz\"), which is\nthe strongest upwelling zone in the world. The [California Current\nSystem](/wiki/California_Current \"California Current\") (CCS) is an eastern\nboundary current of the North Pacific that is also characterized by a north\nand south split. The split in this system occurs at [Point\nConception](/wiki/Point_Conception \"Point Conception\"), California due to weak\nupwelling in the South and strong upwelling in the north. The [Canary\nCurrent](/wiki/Canary_Current \"Canary Current\") is an eastern boundary current\nof the [North Atlantic Gyre](/wiki/North_Atlantic_Gyre \"North Atlantic Gyre\")\nand is also separated due to the presence of the [Canary\nIslands](/wiki/Canary_Islands \"Canary Islands\"). Finally, the [Humboldt\nCurrent](/wiki/Humboldt_Current \"Humboldt Current\") or the Peru Current flows\nwest along the coast of [South America](/wiki/South_America \"South America\")\nfrom [Peru](/wiki/Peru \"Peru\") to [Chile](/wiki/Chile \"Chile\") and extends up\nto 1,000 kilometers offshore.[8] These four eastern boundary currents comprise\nthe majority of coastal upwelling zones in the oceans.\n\n#### Equatorial[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Equatorial\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Equatorial_upwelling_zone_in_the_Pacific_ocean.gif/300px-\nEquatorial_upwelling_zone_in_the_Pacific_ocean.gif)](/wiki/File:Equatorial_upwelling_zone_in_the_Pacific_ocean.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Equatorial_upwelling_zone_in_the_Pacific_ocean.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nEffects of equatorial upwelling on surface chlorophyll concentrations in the\n[Pacific ocean](/wiki/Pacific_ocean \"Pacific ocean\")\n\nUpwelling at the [equator](/wiki/Equator \"Equator\") is associated with the\n[Intertropical Convergence Zone](/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone\n\"Intertropical Convergence Zone\") (ITCZ) which actually moves, and\nconsequently, is often located just north or south of the equator. Easterly\n(westward) trade winds blow from the Northeast and Southeast and converge\nalong the equator blowing West to form the ITCZ. Although there are no\nCoriolis forces present along the equator, upwelling still occurs just north\nand south of the equator. This results in a divergence, with denser, nutrient-\nrich water being upwelled from below, and results in the remarkable fact that\nthe equatorial region in the [Pacific](/wiki/Pacific \"Pacific\") can be\ndetected from space as a broad line of high\n[phytoplankton](/wiki/Phytoplankton \"Phytoplankton\") concentration.[3]\n\n#### Southern Ocean[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Southern Ocean\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Antarctic_bottom_water.svg/300px-\nAntarctic_bottom_water.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Antarctic_bottom_water.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Antarctic_bottom_water.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUpwelling in the [Southern Ocean](/wiki/Southern_Ocean \"Southern Ocean\")\n\nLarge-scale upwelling is also found in the [Southern\nOcean](/wiki/Southern_Ocean \"Southern Ocean\"). Here, strong westerly\n(eastward) winds blow around [Antarctica](/wiki/Antarctica \"Antarctica\"),\ndriving a significant flow of water northwards. This is actually a type of\ncoastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes\nbetween [South America](/wiki/South_America \"South America\") and the tip of\nthe Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In\nmany numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean\nupwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to\nthe surface. In some regions of Antarctica, wind-driven upwelling near the\ncoast pulls relatively warm [Circumpolar deep\nwater](/wiki/Circumpolar_deep_water \"Circumpolar deep water\") onto the\ncontinental shelf, where it can enhance ice shelf melt and influence ice sheet\nstability.[12] Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found in off the west\ncoasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and\nsouthwest and [south\nAustralia](/wiki/Great_South_Australian_Coastal_Upwelling_System \"Great South\nAustralian Coastal Upwelling System\"), all associated with oceanic subtropical\nhigh pressure circulations (see coastal upwelling above).\n\nSome models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs\nin the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low\nlatitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion\ncoefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real\nocean. Nonetheless, some diffusive upwelling does probably occur.\n\n#### Other sources[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Other sources\")]\n\n  * Local and intermittent upwellings may occur when offshore islands, [ridges](/wiki/Ridges \"Ridges\"), or [seamounts](/wiki/Seamounts \"Seamounts\") cause a deflection of deep currents, providing a nutrient rich area in otherwise low productivity ocean areas. Examples include upwellings around the [Galapagos Islands](/wiki/Galapagos_Islands \"Galapagos Islands\") and the [Seychelles Islands](/wiki/Seychelles_Islands \"Seychelles Islands\"), which have major [pelagic](/wiki/Pelagic \"Pelagic\") fisheries.[3]\n  * Upwelling can also occur when a [tropical cyclone](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone \"Tropical cyclone\") transits an area, usually when moving at speeds of less than 5 mph (8 km/h). The churning of a cyclone eventually draws up cooler water from lower layers of the ocean. This causes the cyclone to weaken.\n  * Artificial upwelling is produced by devices that use ocean wave energy or ocean thermal energy conversion to pump water to the surface. Ocean wind turbines are also known to produce upwellings.[13] Ocean wave devices have been shown to produce plankton blooms.[14]\n\n## Variations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Variations\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Sstanom_199711_krig.jpg/300px-\nSstanom_199711_krig.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sstanom_199711_krig.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sstanom_199711_krig.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUnusually strong winds from the east push warm (red) surface water towards\nAfrica, allowing cold (blue) water to upwell along the Sumatran coast\n\nUpwelling intensity depends on wind strength and seasonal variability, as well\nas the vertical structure of the [water](/wiki/Water \"Water\"), variations in\nthe bottom [bathymetry](/wiki/Bathymetry \"Bathymetry\"), and instabilities in\nthe [currents](/wiki/Current_\\(fluid\\) \"Current \\(fluid\\)\").\n\nIn some areas, upwelling is a [seasonal](/wiki/Seasonal \"Seasonal\") event\nleading to periodic bursts of productivity similar to spring\n[blooms](/wiki/Phytoplankton_bloom \"Phytoplankton bloom\") in coastal waters.\nWind-induced upwelling is generated by temperature differences between the\nwarm, light air above the land and the cooler denser air over the sea. In\n[temperate](/wiki/Temperate \"Temperate\") [latitudes](/wiki/Latitudes\n\"Latitudes\"), the temperature contrast is greatly seasonably variable,\ncreating periods of strong upwelling in the spring and summer, to weak or no\nupwelling in the winter. For example, off the coast of Oregon, there are four\nor five strong upwelling events separated by periods of little to no upwelling\nduring the six-month season of upwelling. In contrast,\n[tropical](/wiki/Tropical \"Tropical\") [latitudes](/wiki/Latitudes \"Latitudes\")\nhave a more constant temperature contrast, creating constant upwelling\nthroughout the year. The Peruvian upwelling, for instance, occurs throughout\nmost of the year, resulting in one of the world's largest marine fisheries for\n[sardines](/wiki/Sardines \"Sardines\") and [anchovies](/wiki/Anchovies\n\"Anchovies\").[4]\n\nIn anomalous years when the [trade winds](/wiki/Trade_winds \"Trade winds\")\nweaken or reverse, the water that is upwelled is much warmer and low in\nnutrients, resulting in a sharp reduction in the biomass and\n[phytoplankton](/wiki/Phytoplankton \"Phytoplankton\") productivity. This event\nis known as the [El Nino-Southern Oscillation](/wiki/El_Nino-\nSouthern_Oscillation \"El Nino-Southern Oscillation\") (ENSO) event. The\nPeruvian upwelling system is particularly vulnerable to ENSO events, and can\ncause extreme interannual variability in productivity.[4]\n\nChanges in bathymetry can affect the strength of an upwelling. For example, a\nsubmarine [ridge](/wiki/Ridge \"Ridge\") that extends out from the coast will\nproduce more favorable upwelling conditions than neighboring regions.\nUpwelling typically begins at such ridges and remains strongest at the ridge\neven after developing in other locations.[4]\n\n## High productivity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: High productivity\")]\n\nSince upwelling regions are important sources of marine productivity, and they\nattract hundreds of species throughout the trophic levels, the diversity of\nthese systems has been a focal point for [marine\nresearch](/wiki/Marine_research \"Marine research\"). While studying the trophic\nlevels and patterns typical of upwelling regions, researchers have discovered\nthat upwelling systems exhibit a wasp-waist richness pattern. In this type of\npattern, the high and low [trophic levels](/wiki/Trophic_level \"Trophic\nlevel\") are well-represented by high species diversity. However, the\nintermediate trophic level is only represented by one or two species. This\ntrophic layer, which consists of small, [pelagic fish](/wiki/Pelagic_fish\n\"Pelagic fish\") usually makes up about only three to four percent of the\nspecies diversity of all fish species present. The lower trophic layers are\nvery well-represented with about 500 species of [copepods](/wiki/Copepods\n\"Copepods\"), 2500 species of [gastropods](/wiki/Gastropods \"Gastropods\"), and\n2500 species of [crustaceans](/wiki/Crustaceans \"Crustaceans\") on average. At\nthe apex and near-apex trophic levels, there are usually about 100 species of\nmarine mammals and about 50 species of marine birds. The vital intermediate\ntrophic species however are small pelagic fish that usually feed on\n[phytoplankton](/wiki/Phytoplankton \"Phytoplankton\"). In most upwelling\nsystems, these species are either anchovies or sardines, and usually only one\nis present, although two or three species may be present occasionally. These\nfish are an important food source for predators, such as large pelagic fish,\nmarine mammals, and marine birds. Although they are not at the base of the\ntrophic pyramid, they are the vital species that connect the entire marine\necosystem and keep the productivity of upwelling zones so high[11]\n\n## Threats to upwelling\necosystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Threats to upwelling ecosystems\")]\n\nA major threat to both this crucial intermediate [trophic\nlevel](/wiki/Trophic_level \"Trophic level\") and the entire upwelling trophic\n[ecosystem](/wiki/Ecosystem \"Ecosystem\") is the problem of [commercial\nfishing](/wiki/Commercial_fishing \"Commercial fishing\"). Since upwelling\nregions are the most productive and species rich areas in the world, they\nattract a high number of commercial fishers and fisheries. On one hand, this\nis another benefit of the upwelling process as it serves as a viable source of\nfood and income for so many people and nations besides marine animals.\nHowever, just as in any ecosystem, the consequences of over-fishing from a\npopulation could be detrimental to that population and the ecosystem as a\nwhole. In upwelling ecosystems, every species present plays a vital role in\nthe functioning of that ecosystem. If one species is significantly depleted,\nthat will have an effect throughout the rest of the trophic levels. For\nexample, if a popular prey species is targeted by fisheries, fishermen may\ncollect hundreds of thousands of individuals of this species just by casting\ntheir nets into the upwelling waters. As these fish are depleted, the food\nsource for those who preyed on these fish is depleted. Therefore, the\npredators of the targeted fish will begin to die off, and there will not be as\nmany of them to feed the predators above them. This system continues\nthroughout the entire [food chain](/wiki/Food_chain \"Food chain\"), resulting\nin a possible collapse of the ecosystem. It is possible that the ecosystem may\nbe restored over time, but not all species can recover from events such as\nthese. Even if the species can adapt, there may be a delay in the\nreconstruction of this upwelling community.[11]\n\nThe possibility of such an ecosystem collapse is the very danger of\n[fisheries](/wiki/Fisheries \"Fisheries\") in upwelling regions. Fisheries may\ntarget a variety of different species, and therefore they are a direct threat\nto many species in the ecosystem, however they pose the highest threat to the\nintermediate [pelagic fish](/wiki/Pelagic_fish \"Pelagic fish\"). Since these\nfish form the crux of the entire trophic process of upwelling ecosystems, they\nare highly represented throughout the ecosystem (even if there is only one\nspecies present). Unfortunately, these fish tend to be the most popular\ntargets of fisheries as about 64 percent of their entire catch consists of\npelagic fish. Among those, the six main species that usually form the\nintermediate trophic layer represent over half of the catch.[11]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/El_Ni%C3%B1o_Conditions.jpg/300px-\nEl_Ni%C3%B1o_Conditions.jpg)](/wiki/File:El_Ni%C3%B1o_Conditions.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:El_Ni%C3%B1o_Conditions.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDuring an [El Niño](/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o \"El Niño\"), wind indirectly drives warm\nwater to the South American coast, reducing the effects of cold upwelling\n\nBesides directly causing the collapse of the ecosystem due to their absence,\nthis can create problems in the ecosystem through a variety of other methods\nas well. The animals higher in the [trophic levels](/wiki/Trophic_levels\n\"Trophic levels\") may not completely starve to death and die off, but the\ndecreased food supply could still hurt the populations. If animals do not get\nenough food, it will decrease their reproductive viability meaning that they\nwill not breed as often or as successfully as usual. This can lead to a\ndecreasing population, especially in species that do not breed often under\nnormal circumstances or become reproductively mature late in life. Another\nproblem is that the decrease in the population of a species due to fisheries\ncan lead to a decrease in genetic diversity, resulting in a decrease in [bio-\ndiversity](/wiki/Bio-diversity \"Bio-diversity\") of a species. If the species\ndiversity is decreased significantly, this could cause problems for the\nspecies in an environment that is so variable and quick-changing; they may not\nbe able to adapt, which could result in a collapse of the population or\necosystem.[11]\n\nAnother threat to the productivity and ecosystems of upwelling regions is [El\nNiño-Southern Oscillation](/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o-Southern_Oscillation \"El Niño-\nSouthern Oscillation\") (ENSO) system, or more specifically El Niño events.\nDuring the normal period and [La Niña](/wiki/La_Ni%C3%B1a \"La Niña\") events,\nthe easterly trade winds are still strong, which continues to drive the\nprocess of upwelling. However, during El Niño events, trade winds are weaker,\ncausing decreased upwelling in the [equatorial](/wiki/Equator \"Equator\")\nregions as the divergence of water north and south of the equator is not as\nstrong or as prevalent. The coastal upwelling zones diminish as well since\nthey are wind driven systems, and the wind is no longer a very strong driving\nforce in these areas. As a result, global upwelling drastically decreases,\ncausing a decrease in productivity as the waters are no longer receiving\nnutrient-rich water. Without these nutrients, the rest of the [trophic\npyramid](/wiki/Trophic_pyramid \"Trophic pyramid\") cannot be sustained, and the\nrich upwelling ecosystem will collapse.[15]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Upwelling&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Anderson DM, Prell WL.
