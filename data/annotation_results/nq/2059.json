        "# Database schema\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nThe **database schema** of a [database system](/wiki/Database_system \"Database\nsystem\") is its structure described in a [formal\nlanguage](/wiki/Formal_language \"Formal language\") supported by the [database\nmanagement system](/wiki/Database_management_system \"Database management\nsystem\") (DBMS). The term \"[schema](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schema\n\"wikt:schema\")\" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the\ndatabase is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of\n[relational databases](/wiki/Relational_databases \"Relational databases\")).\nThe formal definition of a [database](/wiki/Database \"Database\") schema is a\nset of formulas (sentences) called [integrity\nconstraints](/wiki/Integrity_constraints \"Integrity constraints\") imposed on a\ndatabase.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] These integrity constraints ensure\ncompatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in\nthe same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of\nthe [database language](/wiki/Database_language \"Database language\").[1] The\nstates of a created [conceptual schema](/wiki/Conceptual_schema \"Conceptual\nschema\") are transformed into an [explicit\nmapping](/wiki/Explicit_and_implicit_methods \"Explicit and implicit methods\"),\nthe database schema. This describes how real-world entities are\n[modeled](/wiki/Data_modeling \"Data modeling\") in the database.\n\n\"A database schema specifies, based on the [database\nadministrator](/wiki/Database_administrator \"Database administrator\")'s\nknowledge of possible applications, the facts that can enter the database, or\nthose of interest to the possible [end-users](/wiki/End-user \"End-user\").\"[2]\nThe notion of a database schema plays the same role as the notion of theory in\n[predicate calculus](/wiki/Predicate_calculus \"Predicate calculus\"). A model\nof this \"theory\" closely corresponds to a database, which can be seen at any\ninstant of time as a [mathematical object](/wiki/Mathematical_object\n\"Mathematical object\"). Thus a schema can contain formulas representing\n[integrity constraints](/wiki/Data_integrity#Types_of_integrity_constraints\n\"Data integrity\") specifically for an application and the constraints\nspecifically for a type of database, all expressed in the same database\nlanguage.[1] In a [relational database](/wiki/Relational_database \"Relational\ndatabase\"), the schema defines the [tables](/wiki/Table_\\(database\\) \"Table\n\\(database\\)\"), [fields](/wiki/Field_\\(computer_science\\) \"Field \\(computer\nscience\\)\"), [relationships](/wiki/Relational_model \"Relational model\"),\n[views](/wiki/View_\\(database\\) \"View \\(database\\)\"),\n[indexes](/wiki/Index_\\(database\\) \"Index \\(database\\)\"),\n[packages](/wiki/Software_package_\\(installation\\) \"Software package\n\\(installation\\)\"), [procedures](/wiki/Stored_procedure \"Stored procedure\"),\n[functions](/wiki/Subroutine \"Subroutine\"),\n[queues](/wiki/Queue_\\(data_structure\\) \"Queue \\(data structure\\)\"),\n[triggers](/wiki/Database_trigger \"Database trigger\"), [types](/wiki/Data_type\n\"Data type\"), [sequences](/wiki/Sequence \"Sequence\"), [materialized\nviews](/wiki/Materialized_view \"Materialized view\"),\n[synonyms](/wiki/Synonym_\\(database\\) \"Synonym \\(database\\)\"), database links,\n[directories](/wiki/Directory_\\(file_systems\\) \"Directory \\(file systems\\)\"),\n[XML schemas](/wiki/XML_schema \"XML schema\"), and other elements.\n\nA database generally stores its schema in a [data\ndictionary](/wiki/Data_dictionary \"Data dictionary\"). Although a schema is\ndefined in text database language, the term is often used to refer to a\ngraphical depiction of the database structure. In other words, schema is the\nstructure of the database that defines the objects in the database.\n\nIn an [Oracle Database](/wiki/Oracle_Database \"Oracle Database\") system, the\nterm \"schema\" has a slightly different connotation.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Ideal requirements for schema integration\n  * 2 Example of two schema integrations\n  * 3 Oracle database specificity\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n## Ideal requirements for schema\nintegration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Database_schema&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Ideal requirements for schema integration\")]\n\nSee also: [Database normalization](/wiki/Database_normalization \"Database\nnormalization\")\n\nThe requirements listed below influence the detailed structure of schemas that\nare produced. Certain applications will not require that all of these\nconditions are met, but these four requirements are the most ideal.\n\nOverlap preservation\n\n    Each of the overlapping elements specified in the input mapping is also in a database schema relation.[3]\n\nExtended overlap preservation\n\n    Source-specific elements that are associated with a source’s overlapping elements are passed through to the database schema.[3]\n\nNormalization\n\n    Independent entities and relationships in the source data should not be grouped together in the same relation in the database schema. In particular, source specific schema elements should not be grouped with overlapping schema elements, if the grouping co-locates independent entities or relationships.[3]\n\nMinimality\n\n    If any elements of the database schema are dropped then the database schema is not ideal.[3]\n\n## Example of two schema\nintegrations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Database_schema&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Example of two schema integrations\")]\n\nSuppose we want a mediated (database) schema to integrate two travel\ndatabases, Go-travel and Ok-travel.\n\n**`Go-travel`** has two relations:\n\n    \n    \n    Go-flight(f-num, time, meal(yes/no))\n    Go-price(f-num, date, price)\n    \n\n(`f-num` being the flight number)\n\n**`Ok-travel`** has just one relation:\n\n    \n    \n    Ok-flight(f-num, date, time, price, nonstop(yes/no))\n    \n\nThe overlapping information in Ok-travel’s and Go-travel’s schemas could be\nrepresented in a mediated schema:[3]\n\n    \n    \n    Flight(f-num, date, time, price)\n    \n\n## Oracle database\nspecificity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Database_schema&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Oracle database specificity\")]\n\nIn the context of [Oracle Databases](/wiki/Oracle_Database \"Oracle Database\"),\na **schema object** is a logical [data storage\nstructure](/wiki/Database_storage_structures \"Database storage\nstructures\").[4]\n\nAn Oracle database associates a separate schema with each database\n**user**.[5] A schema comprises a collection of schema objects. Examples of\nschema objects include:\n\n  * [tables](/wiki/Table_\\(database\\) \"Table \\(database\\)\")\n  * [views](/wiki/View_\\(database\\) \"View \\(database\\)\")\n  * [sequences](/wiki/Sequence \"Sequence\")\n  * [synonyms](/wiki/Synonym_\\(database\\) \"Synonym \\(database\\)\")\n  * [indexes](/wiki/Index_\\(database\\) \"Index \\(database\\)\")\n  * clusters\n  * database links\n  * [snapshots](/wiki/Snapshot_\\(computer_storage\\) \"Snapshot \\(computer storage\\)\")\n  * [procedures](/wiki/Stored_procedure \"Stored procedure\")\n  * functions\n  * packages\n\nOn the other hand, non-schema objects may include:[6]\n\n  * users\n  * roles\n  * contexts\n  * directory objects\n\nSchema objects do not have a one-to-one correspondence to physical files on\ndisk that store their information. However, [Oracle\ndatabases](/wiki/Oracle_database \"Oracle database\") store schema objects\nlogically within a [tablespace](/wiki/Tablespace \"Tablespace\") of the\ndatabase. The data of each object is physically contained in one or more of\nthe tablespace's [datafiles](/wiki/Datafile \"Datafile\"). For some objects\n(such as tables, indexes, and clusters) a [database\nadministrator](/wiki/Database_administrator \"Database administrator\") can\nspecify how much disk space the Oracle [RDBMS](/wiki/RDBMS \"RDBMS\") allocates\nfor the object within the tablespace's datafiles.\n\nThere is no necessary relationship between schemas and tablespaces: a\ntablespace can contain objects from different schemas, and the objects for a\nsingle schema can reside in different tablespaces.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Database_schema&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Data element](/wiki/Data_element \"Data element\")\n  * [Data mapping](/wiki/Data_mapping \"Data mapping\")\n  * [Database design](/wiki/Database_design \"Database design\")\n  * [Entity–relationship model](/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model \"Entity–relationship model\")\n  * [Knowledge representation and reasoning](/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning \"Knowledge representation and reasoning\")\n  * [Object-role modeling](/wiki/Object-role_modeling \"Object-role modeling\")\n  * [Schema matching](/wiki/Schema_matching \"Schema matching\")\n  * [Three-schema approach](/wiki/Three-schema_approach \"Three-schema approach\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Database_schema&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Rybinski, H.
