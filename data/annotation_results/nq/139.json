Out of the over 160\nacts that passed through the preliminary auditions, 48 went on to perform in\nthe live shows. This season, the callbacks were renamed \"The Vegas Verdicts\".\nUnlike previous seasons, the acts were not given a chance to perform a second\ntime, unless prompted by the judges to as a challenge. The judges re-watched\naudition tapes and created a Top 40 based on the acts' preliminary\nperformances, similar to the format used on sister show _[Britain's Got\nTalent](/wiki/Britain%27s_Got_Talent \"Britain's Got Talent\")_. However, it was\nrevealed during the first performance show that the judges, when prompted by\nexecutive producer [Simon Cowell](/wiki/Simon_Cowell \"Simon Cowell\"), called\nback eight acts that they previously had cut. This brought the total number of\nacts up to 48. Last season, the acts who passed through were divided into four\ngroups, who performed over the course of two weeks with the acts who passed\nthrough from the previous night being announced before the next group of acts'\nperformances. This year, each group in the Top 48 was divided into four groups\nof 12, but only one group performed per week, as a separate results show for\nthe group aired the next day. This season was the first to feature results\nepisodes lasting one hour on a weekly basis since season one.\n\nDuring the performances episodes, if all three judges buzzed an act, the act\nwas forced to end, unlike the previous season, where it could continue on for\na short time. In the results episodes, five best acts from each group of\ntwelve proceeded to the semi-finals - four acts were determined solely by\nviewers' votes, the judges decided between acts with the fifth and sixth\nhighest viewers' vote totals. The twelve acts were presented to the audience\nin groups of two or three (usually similar acts - e.g. dancers, children - are\nput together) and then the host announced which of them moved forward and\nwhich of them had been eliminated. When three acts are presented as a group,\nthe host would first announce an act from the three as the first act\neliminated, then would announce which act from the remaining two remained in\nthe competition. The final group were acts in the fifth and sixth places and\nthe judges pick one of them by majority voting. At no time was the audience\nmade aware of how many viewers' votes each act received.\n\nIn the semifinals, the twenty acts who passed through the quarterfinals were\ndivided into groups of 10. One of these groups performed each week, with a\nperformance episode followed by the results the following day. Only four acts\nwere supposed to pass through to the finals each week. Three are determined\nsolely by viewers' votes, but the fourth and fifth place acts must face the\njudges' decision. However, in one case, the judges passed through both\nperformers, as they could not make a decision. In the other case, the top five\nacts were passed through. Instead of previous seasons, where the finals\ncontain four or five acts, this season the finale contained ten acts.\n\n## Preliminary\nauditions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=America%27s_Got_Talent_\\(season_4\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Preliminary auditions\")]\n\nThis year, auditions were held in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New\nYork City\"), [Houston](/wiki/Houston \"Houston\"), [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\"), [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\"),\n[Miami](/wiki/Miami \"Miami\"), and [Seattle](/wiki/Seattle\n\"Seattle\")/[Tacoma](/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington \"Tacoma, Washington\"). Auditions\nwere also held in [Boston](/wiki/Boston \"Boston\"), [Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta\n\"Atlanta\"), and [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\")\nbut not televised. A total of 160 acts advanced to the [Las\nVegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley \"Las Vegas Valley\") Round.[4] [5] [6] [7] [8]\n[9] [10] [11] [12] [13]\n\n## Second\nround[[edit](/w/index.php?title=America%27s_Got_Talent_\\(season_4\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Second round\")]\n\n### Vegas\nVerdicts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=America%27s_Got_Talent_\\(season_4\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Vegas Verdicts\")]\n\nVegas Verdicts aired on July 28, 2009 and July 29, 2009. Over the course of\nthe two episodes, the over 160 acts that made it through the preliminary\nrounds were narrowed down to a Top 40 that made it through to the live\nperformance rounds.\n\nIn the first episode of the \"Vegas Verdicts\", as Cannon referred to it, the\nepisode started off with 25 of the 160 acts being eliminated right at the Las\nVegas Airport. The remaining acts were then briefly shown enjoying the sights\nof Vegas, before the eliminations resumed. Acts were brought before the judges\nand informed of their fate. The judges selected three dance groups: Destined 2\nBe, BreakSk8, and U4ria Dance Crew for a challenge. They were asked to prepare\na dance routine for 12 hours plus they'll have the same piece of music. After\nthey perform, the judges will decide which dance groups will advance to the\nTop 40 Quarterfinals.[14][15]\n\nIn the second episode, the remainder of the Top 40 was revealed, and many more\nacts were eliminated. The three dance crews challenged in the previous episode\nwere shown in a montage performing their challenge performance.[16][17]\n\nAt the end of the second episode, [Simon Cowell](/wiki/Simon_Cowell \"Simon\nCowell\"), executive producer of the show, called the judges on their flight\nback to [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\"), stating that he was\nunhappy with some of the eliminations the judges made. Cowell revealed that\nthere was just \"too much talent\" eliminated, and that he felt that a number of\nthese acts should be given another chance. As a result, two acts were brought\nback as wildcards during each quarterfinal round.\n\n#### First\ncut[[edit](/w/index.php?title=America%27s_Got_Talent_\\(season_4\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: First cut\")]\n\nActs that were eliminated at the Las Vegas Airport include:\n\n  * Circus R Us \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 4\": [Contortion](/wiki/Contortion \"Contortion\"), [hula hoops](/wiki/Hula_hoop \"Hula hoop\") on [unicycles](/wiki/Unicycle \"Unicycle\")[7]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * [Tallan Noble Latz](/wiki/Tallan_Latz \"Tallan Latz\")\n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 7\": 9-year-old electric guitarist[10]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * Nathan Burton \n    * _Preliminaries, Episode 7 \": Magician, he also appeared in [season one](/wiki/America%27s_Got_Talent_\\(season_1\\) \"America's Got Talent \\(season 1\\)\")[10]_\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * Kari Callin \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 8\": Singer, sang \"[Somewhere](/wiki/Somewhere_\\(song\\) \"Somewhere \\(song\\)\")\" from [West Side Story](/wiki/West_Side_Story_\\(musical\\) \"West Side Story \\(musical\\)\")[11]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * Ciana Pelekai \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 10\": 8-year-old singer, sang \"[At Last](/wiki/At_Last \"At Last\")\".[13]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * Alex Wesley \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 10\": 53-year-old dancer.\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n\n#### Part One\ncuts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=America%27s_Got_Talent_\\(season_4\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Part One cuts\")]\n\nActs that were cut in the first episode of the Vegas Verdict included:\n\n  * Keith Johnson \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 8\": Singer and guitarist, performed \"[Walking in Memphis](/wiki/Walking_in_Memphis \"Walking in Memphis\")\" by [Marc Cohn](/wiki/Marc_Cohn \"Marc Cohn\").[11]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * Tony Ferrante \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 7\": 74-year-old dancer, performed to \"[You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)](/wiki/You_Make_Me_Feel_\\(Mighty_Real\\) \"You Make Me Feel \\(Mighty Real\\)\")\" by [Sylvester James](/wiki/Sylvester_\\(singer\\) \"Sylvester \\(singer\\)\").[10]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * Joseph Constantine \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 4\": Magician[7]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * [The Spiritual Harmonizers](/wiki/The_Spiritual_Harmonizers \"The Spiritual Harmonizers\")\n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 7\": Close harmony singing group of [Post Office](/wiki/Post_Office \"Post Office\") workers.[10]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * Fuchsia FoXXX \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 4\": [Belly dancer](/wiki/Belly_dance \"Belly dance\")[7]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n  * The Hurricane Tricksters \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 4\": Trickers[7]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 1)\": Eliminated\n\n#### Part Two\ncuts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=America%27s_Got_Talent_\\(season_4\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Part Two cuts\")]\n\nActs that were cut in the second episode of the Vegas Verdict included:\n\n  * [Rashida Jolley](/wiki/Rashida_Jolley \"Rashida Jolley\")\n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 8\": Performed and sang \"[Killing Me Softly](/wiki/Killing_Me_Softly_with_His_Song \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\")\" on the harp.[11]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 2)\": Eliminated.[16]\n  * Christopher & Laura Camp \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 8\": Whip act[11]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 2)\": Eliminated.[16]\n  * Duo Design \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 9\": [Hand balancers](/wiki/Adagio_\\(circus_skill\\) \"Adagio \\(circus skill\\)\").[12]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 2)\": Eliminated.[16]\n  * The Flash \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 9\": Jugglers and [acrobats](/wiki/Acrobatics \"Acrobatics\").[12]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 2)\": Eliminated.[16]\n  * The Kalinins \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 8\": Father and son acrobats.[11]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 2)\": Eliminated.[16]\n  * Arthur Gulkarov \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 7\": [Contortionist](/wiki/Contortionist \"Contortionist\") and dancer[10]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 2)\": Eliminated.[16]\n  * Kara & Corey Britz \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 9\": Sibling guitarist/singer duo, performed \"[Every Breath You Take](/wiki/Every_Breath_You_Take \"Every Breath You Take\")\" by [The Police](/wiki/The_Police \"The Police\").[12]\n    * \"Las Vegas Week (Part 2)\": Eliminated.[16]\n  * The Serenades \n    * \"Preliminaries, Episode 9\": Singers.
