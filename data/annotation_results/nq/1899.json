In the\nepisode, six doctors from Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital who are victims of\nan [aviation accident](/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents \"Aviation\naccidents and incidents\") fight to stay alive, but [Dr. Lexie\nGrey](/wiki/Lexie_Grey \"Lexie Grey\") ([Chyler Leigh](/wiki/Chyler_Leigh\n\"Chyler Leigh\")) ultimately dies.

Robbins' femur is broken and\nsticking through the skin, Sloan has serious internal injuries; though\ninitially adrenaline keeps him on his feet. Shepherd is sucked out the side of\nthe plane and awakens alone in the wood; his mangled hand having been pushed\nthrough the door of the plane. However, none are in as bad shape as Lexie, who\nis crushed under a piece of the plane. While Meredith searches for Shepherd,\nYang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie. Eventually, the two realize\nthat they cannot save her, so Sloan holds her hand while she dies, telling her\nthat he loves her. As Sloan tells her of the life the two were meant to have\ntogether, Lexie dies with a smile on her face just as Meredith and Yang are\napproaching.\n\nLexie's death devastates Meredith, who is still desperately trying to find her\nhusband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as\nthey can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is\naware of what has happened to the other doctors.

As the episode ends,\nHunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to\n[Boise](/wiki/Boise,_Idaho \"Boise, Idaho\"). The residents, finally excited to\ncelebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The\nremaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last\nmatch goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the\nspeech that Webber gave in the [pilot\nepisode](/wiki/A_Hard_Day%27s_Night_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\) \"A Hard Day's Night\n\\(Grey's Anatomy\\)\") of the series.\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\n\"It was so hard. It was physically and emotionally challenging because you're\nconstantly at extremely high stakes. The physicality for Cristina, she had to\ndo a lot of things with one arm, and I had to do a lot of things with one\nshoe. You're running around the mountain with one shoe and one arm basically\nand doing things that way. And it's like we've had this cushy time on stages\nand in the hospital. But being out in the open on the side of a mountain was\nexhilarating; you cannot beat location work. I've done very little greenscreen\nwork, but it's just a pooper. I don't care how much you blow that fan on my\nface, there's not a helicopter coming at me. It's really hard to manufacture\nthe clear reality of what that is, but when you are on a mountain and you are\nfreezing, you're freezing.\"\n\n— Oh's impressions on shooting in the mountains[1]\n\nThe episode was written by [Shonda Rhimes](/wiki/Shonda_Rhimes \"Shonda\nRhimes\"), and directed by [Rob Corn](/wiki/Rob_Corn \"Rob Corn\").[2] Featured\nmusic included The Paper Kites' \"Featherstone\" and Feist's 'Graveyard\".[3]\nFilming took place in [Big Bear Lake](/wiki/Big_Bear_Lake,_California \"Big\nBear Lake, California\"), [California](/wiki/California \"California\"), a\nlocation previously used in the [seventh\nseason](/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_\\(season_7\\) \"Grey's Anatomy \\(season 7\\)\") for\nYang and Shepherd's fishing trip.[4] Commenting on the filming conditions,\nLeigh said: \"It would rain and be sunny and hot. I never died before [on\ncamera]. That sounds funny saying that. I think everyone has an emotional\nwellspring and that happened to be a moment where I was sprung. Everybody was\nvery accommodating — the crew, cast. And I opted to stay underneath [the\nwreckage] for the most part over two days rather than trying to get in and\nout.\"[5]\n\nIn regard to the episode, Rhimes commented before it originally aired that it\nwas difficult to write, largely because of the death of a main character. She\ncompared it to writing the [season six\nfinale](/wiki/Sanctuary_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\) \"Sanctuary \\(Grey's Anatomy\\)\"),\nby explaining that the former was \"more painful\" to write.[6] After the\nepisode aired, Rhimes repeated in a tweet that it was hard for her to write\nthe finale, adding: \"I did not enjoy it. It made me sick and it made me\nsad.\"[7] Rhimes also explained the departure of Leigh, whose character died\nafter the plane crash, by saying that the two came to an agreement on the\ndecision to kill Lexie, after extensive discussion. Speaking of Raver's\ndeparture whose character left Seattle Grace for MEDCOM, Rhimes elaborated\nthat Raver was offered a contract renewal, but declined.[7]\n\n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Chyler_leigh_in_2006.jpg/170px-\nChyler_leigh_in_2006.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chyler_leigh_in_2006.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chyler_leigh_in_2006.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Chyler Leigh](/wiki/Chyler_Leigh \"Chyler Leigh\")'s performance was deemed\n\"phenomenal\".\n\nThe episode received mixed reviews among television critics, and it\noutperformed the previous episode in terms of both viewership and ratings.\n\"Flight\" was originally broadcast on May 17, 2012 in the United States on the\n[American Broadcasting Company](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American\nBroadcasting Company\") (ABC). The episode was watched in the United States by\na total of 11.44 million people,[8] a 16.5% (1.62 million) increase from the\nprevious episode \"Migration\", which garnered 9.82 million viewers.[9] In terms\nof viewership, \"Flight\" ranked fourth for the night, behind the season finales\nof [Fox](/wiki/Fox_Network \"Fox Network\")'s _[American\nIdol](/wiki/American_Idol \"American Idol\")_ , and [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\")'s\n_[Person of Interest](/wiki/Person_of_Interest_\\(TV_series\\) \"Person of\nInterest \\(TV series\\)\")_ and _[The Mentalist](/wiki/The_Mentalist \"The\nMentalist\")_.[8] In terms of _Grey 's Anatomy_'s other season finales, the\nepisode was the show's second least-viewed finale, just behind the seventh\nseason's, which garnered 9.89 million viewers.[10] The episode did not rank in\nthe top three for viewership, but its 4.1/11 [Nielsen\nrating](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings \"Nielsen ratings\") ranked first in its 9:00\nEastern time-slot and second for the night, registering the show as Thursday's\nNo. 1 drama, for both the [rating and\nshare](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings#Ratings.2Fshare_and_total_viewers \"Nielsen\nratings\") percentages of the key 18–49 demographic. Its rating lost to\n_American Idol_ , but beat out CBS's _[The Big Bang\nTheory](/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory \"The Big Bang Theory\")_ , _Person of\nInterest_ , and _The Mentalist_.[8] In addition to its rating being in the top\nrankings for the night, it was an increase from the previous episode, which\nnetted a 3.5/10 rating/share in the 18–49 demographic.[9] The episode also\nshowed an increase in ratings in comparison to the previous year's finale,\nwhich attained a 3.6/9 rating/share in the 18–49 demographic.[10]\n\n_[Poptimal](/wiki/Poptimal \"Poptimal\")_ 's Tanya Lane wrote, \"Wow…just wow.\n_Grey 's Anatomy_ has once again managed to shock with its season finale.\"\nWhile she appreciated the \"realism and authenticity that _Grey 's_ is known\nfor\", she found the episode was \"almost too much\" as it was \"extremely gory\nand difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds\" but later\nbecause of the \"heavy and emotional things that transpired\". She thought\nPompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her\nsister was dead.[11] _[Digital Spy](/wiki/Digital_Spy \"Digital Spy\")_ 's Ben\nLee found Leigh's and Dane's performances \"phenomenal\" and added that he had\nprobably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment\nthe two actors shared as \"truly poignant\". To him, Lexie's death felt like a\nfinale, which was thus too early. As for what was happening in Seattle Grace,\nhe thought it was \"a bit pointless\" and \"uninteresting\" except Altman's\ndeparture, which he deemed \"the most significant moment at the hospital\".[12]\n_[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\")_ 's\nTanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: \"It was an intense death. I mean,\nhow awful was it to watch one of _Grey’s_ longest-running characters pass away\nso quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what\nshe had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I\ndon't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less\nimportant somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And\nyou probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?\" Stransky\nalso complained about Robbins' screams at the beginning of the episode, but\nenjoyed Bailey's story.[13]\n\nIn an _Entertainment Weekly_ poll that judged all the television season\nfinales of the year, Lexie's death was voted the \"Top Tissue Moment\",[14]\nwhile Robbins' injured leg and Shepherd's mangled hand were voted the \"Most\nDisturbing Image\".[15] The ending of the episode was also considered as the\n\"Best Ending to an Otherwise So-So Season\".[16] Lexie's death was also\nnominated under the \"Best (Presumed) Death\" category,[17] while the plane\ncrash's aftermath was nominated as the \"Best Non-romantic Cliffhanger\",[18]\nand the episode in entirety was nominated for the special award for \"Biggest\nRegret That I Didn't See It, I Just Heard or Read About It\".[19]\n_Entertainment Weekly_ later named the scene where Meredith is crying one of\nthe best crying scenes of 2012.[20] In [TVLine](/wiki/TVLine \"TVLine\")'s\nreview of 2012, Lexie's death was runner-up for \"Biggest Tearjerker\".[21] The\nepisode is nominated at the [NAACP Image Awards](/wiki/NAACP_Image_Award\n\"NAACP Image Award\") under the Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series\ncategory for Rhimes.[22]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Flight_\\(Grey%27s_Anatomy\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Goldberg, Lesley (June 25, 2012).
