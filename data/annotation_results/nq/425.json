The tournament was first held in 1987, when the tournament was co-\nhosted by New Zealand and Australia. [New\nZealand](/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team \"New Zealand national\nrugby union team\") are the current champions, having defeated\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia_national_rugby_union_team \"Australia national\nrugby union team\") in the final of the [2015\ntournament](/wiki/2015_Rugby_World_Cup \"2015 Rugby World Cup\") in\n[England](/wiki/England \"England\").\n\nThe winners are awarded the [William Webb Ellis\nCup](/wiki/William_Webb_Ellis_Cup \"William Webb Ellis Cup\"), named after\n[William Webb Ellis](/wiki/William_Webb_Ellis \"William Webb Ellis\"), the\n[Rugby School](/wiki/Rugby_School \"Rugby School\") pupil who — according to a\npopular legend — invented rugby by picking up the ball during a football game.\nFour countries have won the trophy; New Zealand have won it three times, two\nteams have won twice, [Australia](/wiki/Australia_national_rugby_union_team\n\"Australia national rugby union team\") and [South\nAfrica](/wiki/South_Africa_national_rugby_union_team \"South Africa national\nrugby union team\"), while [England](/wiki/England_national_rugby_union_team\n\"England national rugby union team\") have won it once.\n\nThe tournament is administered by [World Rugby](/wiki/World_Rugby \"World\nRugby\"), the sport's international governing body. Sixteen teams were invited\nto participate in the inaugural tournament in 1987, however since 1999 twenty\nteams have taken part. Japan will host the [next event in\n2019](/wiki/2019_Rugby_World_Cup \"2019 Rugby World Cup\") and France will host\n[in 2023](/wiki/2023_Rugby_World_Cup \"2023 Rugby World Cup\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Format\n    * 1.1 Qualification\n    * 1.2 Tournament\n  * 2 History\n  * 3 Trophy\n  * 4 Selection of hosts\n  * 5 Tournament growth\n    * 5.1 Media coverage\n    * 5.2 Attendance\n    * 5.3 Revenue\n  * 6 Results\n    * 6.1 Tournaments\n    * 6.2 Performance of nations\n    * 6.3 Team records\n  * 7 Records and statistics\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n    * 9.1 Printed sources\n    * 9.2 Notes\n    * 9.3 Citations\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Format\n\n### Qualification\n\nMain article: [Rugby World Cup\nqualification](/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup_qualification \"Rugby World Cup\nqualification\")\n\nQualifying tournaments were introduced for the [second\ntournament](/wiki/1991_Rugby_World_Cup \"1991 Rugby World Cup\"), where eight of\nthe sixteen places were contested in a twenty-four-nation tournament.[1] The\n[inaugural World Cup](/wiki/1987_Rugby_World_Cup \"1987 Rugby World Cup\") in\n1987, did not involve any qualifying process; instead, the 16 places were\nautomatically filled by seven eligible [International Rugby Football\nBoard](/wiki/World_Rugby \"World Rugby\") (IRFB, now World Rugby) member\nnations, and the rest by invitation.[2]\n\nIn 2003 and 2007, the qualifying format allowed for eight of the twenty\navailable positions to be filled by automatic qualification, as the eight\nquarter finalists of the previous tournament enter its successor. The\nremaining twelve positions were filled by [continental](/wiki/Continent\n\"Continent\") qualifying tournaments.[3] Positions were filled by three teams\nfrom the Americas, one from Asia, one from Africa, three from Europe and two\nfrom Oceania.[3] Another two places were allocated for\n[repechage](/wiki/Repechage \"Repechage\"). The first repechage place was\ndetermined by a match between the runners-up from the Africa and Europe\nqualifying tournaments, with that winner then playing the Americas runner-up\nto determine the place.[4] The second repechage position was determined\nbetween the runners-up from the Asia and Oceania qualifiers.[4]\n\nThe current format allows for 12 of the 20 available positions to be filled by\nautomatic qualification, as the teams who finish third or better in the group\n(pool) stages of the previous tournament enter its successor (where they will\nbe [seeded](/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament#Seeding \"Single-elimination\ntournament\")).[5][6] The qualification system for the remaining eight places\nis region-based, with a total eight teams allocated for Europe, five for\nOceania, three for the Americas, two for Africa, and one for Asia. The last\nplace is determined by an intercontinental play-off.[7]\n\n### Tournament\n\nThe 2015 tournament involved twenty nations competing over six weeks.[6][8]\nThere were two stages, a pool and a knockout. Nations were divided into four\npools, A through to D, of five nations each.[8][9] The teams were\n[seeded](/wiki/Seed_\\(sports\\) \"Seed \\(sports\\)\") before the start of the\ntournament, with the seedings taken from the [World\nRankings](/wiki/World_Rugby_Rankings \"World Rugby Rankings\") in December 2012.\nThe four highest-ranked teams were drawn into pools A to D. The next four\nhighest-ranked teams were then drawn into pools A to D, followed by the next\nfour. The remaining positions in each pool were filled by the\nqualifiers.[6][10]\n\nNations play four pool games, playing their respective pool members once\neach.[9] A [bonus points system](/wiki/Rugby_union_bonus_points_system \"Rugby\nunion bonus points system\") is used during pool play. If two or more teams are\nlevel on points, a system of criteria is used to determine the higher ranked;\nthe sixth and final criterion decides the higher rank through the official\nWorld Rankings.[9]\n\nThe winner and runner-up of each pool enter the knockout stage. The knockout\nstage consists of quarter- and semi-finals, and then the final. The winner of\neach pool is placed against a runner-up of a different pool in a quarter-\nfinal. The winner of each quarter-final goes on to the semi-finals, and the\nrespective winners proceed to the final. Losers of the semi-finals contest for\nthird place, called the 'Bronze Final'. If a match in the knockout stages ends\nin a draw, the winner is determined through [extra time](/wiki/Extra_time\n\"Extra time\"). If that fails, the match goes into [sudden\ndeath](/wiki/Sudden_death_\\(sport\\) \"Sudden death \\(sport\\)\") and the next\nteam to score any points is the winner. As a last resort, a kicking\ncompetition is used.[9]\n\n## History\n\nMain article: [History of the Rugby World\nCup](/wiki/History_of_the_Rugby_World_Cup \"History of the Rugby World Cup\")\n\n[![A player holds a ball in front of two opposing groups of eight players.\nEach group is crouched and working together to push against the other\nteam.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/2011_Rugby_World_Cup_Wales_vs_Samoa_%286168183024%29.jpg/300px-2011_Rugby_World_Cup_Wales_vs_Samoa_%286168183024%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:2011_Rugby_World_Cup_Wales_vs_Samoa_\\(6168183024\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2011_Rugby_World_Cup_Wales_vs_Samoa_\\(6168183024\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nA scrum between [Samoa](/wiki/Samoa_national_rugby_union_team \"Samoa national\nrugby union team\") (in blue) and [Wales](/wiki/Wales_national_rugby_union_team\n\"Wales national rugby union team\") (in red) during the 2011 World Cup\n\nPrior to the Rugby World Cup, there was no truly global rugby union\ncompetition, but there were a number of other tournaments. One of the oldest\nis the annual [Six Nations Championship](/wiki/Six_Nations_Championship \"Six\nNations Championship\"), which started in 1883 as the [Home\nNations](/wiki/Home_Nations \"Home Nations\") Championship, a tournament between\n[England](/wiki/England_national_rugby_union_team \"England national rugby\nunion team\"), [Ireland](/wiki/Ireland_national_rugby_union_team \"Ireland\nnational rugby union team\"),\n[Scotland](/wiki/Scotland_national_rugby_union_team \"Scotland national rugby\nunion team\") and [Wales](/wiki/Wales_national_rugby_union_team \"Wales national\nrugby union team\"). It expanded to the Five Nations in 1910, when\n[France](/wiki/France_national_rugby_union_team \"France national rugby union\nteam\") joined the tournament. France did not participate from 1931 to 1939,\nduring which period it reverted to a Home Nations championship. In 2000,\n[Italy](/wiki/Italy_national_rugby_union_team \"Italy national rugby union\nteam\") joined the competition, which became the Six Nations.[11]\n\nRugby union was also played at the [Summer Olympic\nGames](/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games \"Summer Olympic Games\"), first appearing at\nthe [1900 Paris games](/wiki/1900_Summer_Olympics \"1900 Summer Olympics\") and\nsubsequently at [London in 1908](/wiki/1908_Summer_Olympics \"1908 Summer\nOlympics\"), [Antwerp in 1920](/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics \"1920 Summer\nOlympics\"), and [Paris again in 1924](/wiki/1924_Summer_Olympics \"1924 Summer\nOlympics\"). France won the first gold medal, then Australasia, with the last\ntwo being won by the United States. However rugby union ceased to be on\nOlympic program after 1924.[12][13][a]\n\nThe idea of a Rugby World Cup had been suggested on numerous occasions going\nback to the 1950s, but met with opposition from most unions in the IRFB.[14]\nThe idea resurfaced several times in the early 1980s, with the [Australian\nRugby Union](/wiki/Australian_Rugby_Union \"Australian Rugby Union\") (ARU) in\n1983, and the [New Zealand Rugby Union](/wiki/New_Zealand_Rugby_Union \"New\nZealand Rugby Union\") (NZRU) in 1984 independently proposing the establishment\nof a world cup.[15] A proposal was again put to the IRFB in 1985 and this time\nsuccessfully passed 10–6. The delegates from Australia, France, New Zealand\nand South Africa all voted for the proposal, and the delegates from Ireland\nand Scotland against; the English and Welsh delegates were split, with one\nfrom each country for and one against.[14][15]\n\nThe inaugural tournament, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand, was\nheld in May and June 1987, with sixteen nations taking part.[16] [New\nZealand](/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team \"New Zealand national\nrugby union team\") became the first ever champions, defeating\n[France](/wiki/France_national_rugby_union_team \"France national rugby union\nteam\") 29–9 in the final.[17] The subsequent [1991\ntournament](/wiki/1991_Rugby_World_Cup \"1991 Rugby World Cup\") was hosted by\nEngland, with matches played throughout Britain, Ireland and France. This\ntournament saw the introduction of a qualifying tournament; eight places were\nallocated to the quarter-finalists from 1987, and the remaining eight decided\nby a thirty-five nation qualifying tournament.[1]\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia_national_rugby_union_team \"Australia national\nrugby union team\") won the second tournament, defeating\n[England](/wiki/England_national_rugby_union_team \"England national rugby\nunion team\") 12–6 in the final.[18]\n\nIn 1992, eight years after their last official series,[b] [South\nAfrica](/wiki/South_Africa_national_rugby_union_team \"South Africa national\nrugby union team\") hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption\nof international rugby in South Africa came after the dismantling of the\n[apartheid](/wiki/Apartheid \"Apartheid\") system, and was only done with\npermission of the [African National Congress](/wiki/African_National_Congress\n\"African National Congress\").[19][20] With their return to test rugby, South\nAfrica were selected to host the [1995 Rugby World\nCup](/wiki/1995_Rugby_World_Cup \"1995 Rugby World Cup\").[21] After upsetting\nAustralia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the\ntournament until they met New Zealand in the final.[22][23] After a tense\nfinal that went into [extra time](/wiki/Overtime_\\(sports\\) \"Overtime\n\\(sports\\)\"), South Africa emerged 15–12 winners,[24] with then President\n[Nelson Mandela](/wiki/Nelson_Mandela \"Nelson Mandela\"), wearing a Springbok\n[jersey](/wiki/Rugby_shirt \"Rugby shirt\"),[23] presenting the trophy to South\nAfrica's captain, [Francois Pienaar](/wiki/Francois_Pienaar \"Francois\nPienaar\").[25]\n\nThe tournament in [1999](/wiki/1999_Rugby_World_Cup \"1999 Rugby World Cup\")\nwas hosted by Wales with matches also being held throughout the rest of the\nUnited Kingdom, Ireland and France. The tournament included a\n[repechage](/wiki/Repechage \"Repechage\") system, alongside specific regional\nqualifying places, and an increase from sixteen to twenty participating\nnations. Australia claimed their second title, defeating France in the final.\n\nThe [2003 event](/wiki/2003_Rugby_World_Cup \"2003 Rugby World Cup\") was hosted\nby Australia, although it was originally intended to be held jointly with New\nZealand. England emerged as champions defeating Australia in extra time.\nEngland's win was unique in that it broke the [southern\nhemisphere](/wiki/SANZAAR \"SANZAAR\")'s dominance in the event. Such was the\ncelebration of England's victory, that an estimated 750,000 people gathered in\ncentral [London](/wiki/London \"London\") to greet the team, making the day the\nlargest sporting celebration of its kind ever in the United Kingdom.[26]\n\nThe [2007 competition](/wiki/2007_Rugby_World_Cup \"2007 Rugby World Cup\") was\nhosted by France, with matches also being held in Wales and Scotland. South\nAfrica claimed their second title by defeating defending champions England\n15–6. The [2011 tournament](/wiki/2011_Rugby_World_Cup \"2011 Rugby World Cup\")\nwas awarded to New Zealand in November 2005, ahead of bids from\n[Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") and South Africa. The All Blacks reclaimed their\nplace atop the rugby world with a narrow 8–7 win over France in the 2011\nfinal.\n\nIn the [2015 edition of tournament](/wiki/2015_Rugby_World_Cup \"2015 Rugby\nWorld Cup\"), hosted by England, New Zealand once again won the final, this\ntime against established rivals, Australia. In doing so, they became the first\nteam in World Cup history to win three titles, as well as the first to\nsuccessfully defend a title. It was also New Zealand's first title victory on\nforeign soil.\n\n## Trophy\n\nMain article: [Webb Ellis Cup](/wiki/Webb_Ellis_Cup \"Webb Ellis Cup\")\n\nThe Webb Ellis Cup is the prize presented to winners of the Rugby World Cup,\nnamed after [William Webb Ellis](/wiki/William_Webb_Ellis \"William Webb\nEllis\"). The trophy is also referred to simply as the _Rugby World Cup_. The\ntrophy was chosen in 1987 as an appropriate cup for use in the competition,\nand was created in 1906 by Garrard's Crown Jewellers.[27][28] The trophy is\nrestored after each game by fellow Royal Warrant holder [Thomas\nLyte](/wiki/Thomas_Lyte \"Thomas Lyte\").[29][30] The words 'The International\nRugby Football Board' and 'The Webb Ellis Cup' are engraved on the face of the\ncup. It stands thirty-eight centimetres high and is silver gilded in gold, and\nsupported by two cast scroll handles, one with the head of a\n[satyr](/wiki/Satyr \"Satyr\"), and the other a head of a [nymph](/wiki/Nymph\n\"Nymph\").[31] In Australia the trophy is colloquially known as \"Bill\" — a\nreference to William Webb Ellis.\n\n## Selection of hosts\n\nMain article: [Rugby World Cup hosts](/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup_hosts \"Rugby World\nCup hosts\")\n\nTournaments are organised by Rugby World Cup Ltd (RWCL), which is itself owned\nby World Rugby. The selection of host is decided by a vote of World Rugby\nCouncil members.[32][33] The voting procedure is managed by a team of\nindependent auditors, and the voting kept secret. The allocation of a\ntournament to a host nation is now made five or six years prior to the\ncommencement of the event, for example New Zealand were awarded the 2011 event\nin late 2005.\n\nThe tournament has been hosted by multiple nations. For example, the 1987\ntournament was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. World Rugby requires\nthat the hosts must have a venue with a capacity of at least 60,000 spectators\nfor the final.[34] Host nations sometimes construct or upgrade stadia in\npreparation for the World Cup, such as [Millennium\nStadium](/wiki/Millennium_Stadium \"Millennium Stadium\") – purpose built for\nthe 1999 tournament – and [Eden Park](/wiki/Eden_Park \"Eden Park\"), upgraded\nfor 2011.[34][35] The first country outside of the traditional rugby nations\nof [SANZAAR](/wiki/SANZAAR \"SANZAAR\") or the Six Nations to be awarded the\nhosting rights was Japan, who will host the [2019\ntournament](/wiki/2019_Rugby_World_Cup \"2019 Rugby World Cup\"). France will\nhost the [2023 tournament](/wiki/2023_Rugby_World_Cup \"2023 Rugby World Cup\").\n\n## Tournament growth\n\n### Media coverage\n\nOrganizers of the Rugby World Cup, as well as the Global Sports Impact, state\nthat the Rugby World Cup is the third largest sporting event in the World,\nbehind only the [FIFA World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup \"FIFA World Cup\") and\nthe [Olympics](/wiki/Olympics \"Olympics\"),[36][37] although other sources\nquestion whether this is accurate.[38]\n\nReports emanating from World Rugby and its business partners have frequently\ntouted the tournament's media growth, with cumulative worldwide television\naudiences of 300 million for the inaugural 1987 tournament, 1.75 billion in\n1991, 2.67 billion in 1995, 3 billion in 1999,[39] 3.5 billion in 2003,[40]\nand 4 billion in 2007.[41] The 4 billion figure was widely dismissed as the\nglobal audience for television is estimated to be about 4.2 billion.[42]\n\nHowever, independent reviews have called into question the methodology of\nthose growth estimates, pointing to factual inconsistencies.[43] The event's\nsupposed drawing power outside of a handful of rugby strongholds was also\ndownplayed significantly, with an estimated 97 percent of the 33 million\naverage audience produced by the 2007 final coming from\n[Australasia](/wiki/Australasia \"Australasia\"), South Africa, the [British\nIsles](/wiki/British_Isles \"British Isles\") and France.[44] Other sports have\nbeen accused of exaggerating their television reach over the years; such\nclaims are not exclusive to the Rugby World Cup.\n\nWhile the event's global popularity remains a matter of dispute, high interest\nin traditional rugby nations is well documented. The 2003 final, between\nAustralia and England, became the most watched [rugby union](/wiki/Rugby_union\n\"Rugby union\") match in the history of Australian television.[45]\n\n### Attendance\n\nSee also: [List of sports attendance\nfigures](/wiki/List_of_sports_attendance_figures \"List of sports attendance\nfigures\")\n\nAttendance figures[46] Year | Host(s) | Total attendance | Matches | Avg attendance | % change  \nin avg att. | Stadium capacity | Attendance as  \n% of capacity  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n[1987](/wiki/1987_Rugby_World_Cup \"1987 Rugby World Cup\") | [![Australia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/23px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png)](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\")  \n[![New Zealand](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg/23px-Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg.png)](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\") [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\") | 604,500 | 32 | 20,156 | — | 1,006,350 | 60%  \n[1991](/wiki/1991_Rugby_World_Cup \"1991 Rugby World Cup\") | [![England](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/23px-Flag_of_England.svg.png)](/wiki/England \"England\") [England](/wiki/England \"England\")  \n[![Wales](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Flag_of_Wales_2.svg/23px-\nFlag_of_Wales_2.svg.png)](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\") [Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\")  \n[![France](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/23px-\nFlag_of_France.svg.png)](/wiki/France \"France\") [France](/wiki/France\n\"France\")  \n[![Republic of\nIreland](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/23px-\nFlag_of_Ireland.svg.png)](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\")\n[Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\")  \n[![Scotland](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg/23px-Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png)](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\") [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\") | 1,007,760 | 32 | 31,493 | +56% | 1,212,800 | 79%  \n[1995](/wiki/1995_Rugby_World_Cup \"1995 Rugby World Cup\") | [![South Africa](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Flag_of_South_Africa.svg/23px-Flag_of_South_Africa.svg.png)](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\") [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\") | 1,100,000 | 32 | 34,375 | +9% | 1,423,850 | 77%  \n[1999](/wiki/1999_Rugby_World_Cup \"1999 Rugby World Cup\") | [![Wales](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Flag_of_Wales_2.svg/23px-Flag_of_Wales_2.svg.png)](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\") [Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\") | 1,750,000 | 41 | 42,683 | +24% | 2,104,500 | 83%  \n[2003](/wiki/2003_Rugby_World_Cup \"2003 Rugby World Cup\") | [![Australia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/23px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png)](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") | 1,837,547 | 48 | 38,282 | –10% | 2,208,529 | 83%  \n[2007](/wiki/2007_Rugby_World_Cup \"2007 Rugby World Cup\") | [![France](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/23px-Flag_of_France.svg.png)](/wiki/France \"France\") [France](/wiki/France \"France\") | 2,263,223 | 48 | 47,150 | +23% | 2,470,660 | 92%  \n[2011](/wiki/2011_Rugby_World_Cup \"2011 Rugby World Cup\") | [![New Zealand](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg/23px-Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg.png)](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\") [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\") | 1,477,294 | 48 | 30,777 | –35% | 1,732,000 | 85%  \n[2015](/wiki/2015_Rugby_World_Cup \"2015 Rugby World Cup\") | [![England](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/23px-Flag_of_England.svg.png)](/wiki/England \"England\") [England](/wiki/England \"England\") | 2,477,805 | 48 | 51,621 | +68% | 2,600,741 | 95%  \n[2019](/wiki/2019_Rugby_World_Cup \"2019 Rugby World Cup\") | [![Japan](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg/23px-Flag_of_Japan.svg.png)](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") [Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\") | _To be determined_ | 48 | _To be determined_  \n  \n### Revenue\n\nRevenue for Rugby World Cup tournaments[46] Source | [1987](/wiki/1987_Rugby_World_Cup \"1987 Rugby World Cup\") | [1991](/wiki/1991_Rugby_World_Cup \"1991 Rugby World Cup\") | [1995](/wiki/1995_Rugby_World_Cup \"1995 Rugby World Cup\") | [1999](/wiki/1999_Rugby_World_Cup \"1999 Rugby World Cup\") | [2003](/wiki/2003_Rugby_World_Cup \"2003 Rugby World Cup\") | [2007](/wiki/2007_Rugby_World_Cup \"2007 Rugby World Cup\") | [2011](/wiki/2011_Rugby_World_Cup \"2011 Rugby World Cup\") | [2015](/wiki/2015_Rugby_World_Cup \"2015 Rugby World Cup\")  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nGate receipts (M [£](/wiki/Pound_sterling \"Pound sterling\")) | \\-- | \\-- | 15 | 55 | 81 | 147 | 131 | -
