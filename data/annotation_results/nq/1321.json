Sri\nLanka](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Sri_Lanka \"Prime Minister of Sri Lanka\") since\nthe creation of the position in 1947, prior to the formation of the [Dominion\nof Ceylon](/wiki/Dominion_of_Ceylon \"Dominion of Ceylon\"). The Prime Minister\nof Ceylon was the head of the government until 1978. In 1972, the country was\nnamed as the _Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka_ and the\nposition was known as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from then onwards. The\nPrime Minister also held the unified [Ministry of External Affairs and\nDefence](/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_and_Defence \"Ministry of External\nAffairs and Defence\") until 1977, when [J.R.\nJayewardene](/wiki/Junius_Richard_Jayewardene \"Junius Richard Jayewardene\")'s\ngovernment adapted two separate ministries, forming the [Ministry of\nDefence](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_\\(Sri_Lanka\\) \"Ministry of Defence \\(Sri\nLanka\\)\") and the [Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_\\(Sri_Lanka\\) \"Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs \\(Sri Lanka\\)\").\n\nIn 1978, Prime Minister [J.R. Jayewardene](/wiki/Junius_Richard_Jayewardene\n\"Junius Richard Jayewardene\") introduced new constitutional changes. The\nposition of the [Executive President](/wiki/President_of_Sri_Lanka \"President\nof Sri Lanka\") was introduced, resulting in the powers of the Prime Minister\nbeing reduced. The President became the [head of state](/wiki/Head_of_state\n\"Head of state\") and [head of government](/wiki/Head_of_government \"Head of\ngovernment\"),[1] and the Prime Minister became a nominal position.[2]\n\nUnder the current [constitution of Sri Lanka](/wiki/Constitution_of_Sri_Lanka\n\"Constitution of Sri Lanka\"), the Prime Minister is the leader of the\n[Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Sri_Lanka \"Cabinet of Sri Lanka\") business and also\nfunctions as a deputy to the President. In the event a president dies in\noffice, the Prime Minister becomes the acting president until the Parliament\nconvens to elect a successor or new elections can be held to elect a new\npresident. This was the case in 1993, when President [Ranasinghe\nPremadasa](/wiki/Ranasinghe_Premadasa \"Ranasinghe Premadasa\") was assassinated\nand Prime Minister [Dingiri Banda Wijetunge](/wiki/Dingiri_Banda_Wijetunge\n\"Dingiri Banda Wijetunge\") took office as President.[3]\n\nOn 28 April 2015, the Parliament approved the [Nineteenth Amendment to the\nConstitution of Sri\nLanka](/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_Constitution_of_Sri_Lanka \"Nineteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka\") which gives the power of the\n[Government](/wiki/Government_of_Sri_Lanka \"Government of Sri Lanka\") to the\nPrime Minister, while the [President](/wiki/President_of_Sri_Lanka \"President\nof Sri Lanka\") remains the [head of state](/wiki/Head_of_state \"Head of\nstate\"), head of the [cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Sri_Lanka \"Cabinet of Sri\nLanka\"), and [Commander-in-chief](/wiki/Commander-in-chief \"Commander-in-\nchief\").[4]\n\nOf the fourteen prime ministers who have held office since the introduction of\nthe position in 1947, three have held office thrice, and one has held office\ntwice. Five prime ministers have gone on to become president of the country.\nThe current Prime Minister of Sri Lanka is [Ranil\nWickremesinghe](/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe \"Ranil Wickremesinghe\"), since 9\nJanuary 2015.[5]\n\n[Ranil Wickramasinghe](/wiki/Ranil_Wickramasinghe \"Ranil Wickramasinghe\") has\nbeen sworn in as prime minister the most times in the country's history, on\nfour separate occasions (May 1993, December 2001, January 2015 and August\n2015), [6] whilst [Dudley Shelton Senanayaka](/wiki/Dudley_Shelton_Senanayaka\n\"Dudley Shelton Senanayaka\") and [Sirimavo\nBandaranayake](/wiki/Sirimavo_Bandaranayake \"Sirimavo Bandaranayake\") were\nappointed three times.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 List of Prime Ministers\n  * 2 Living former Prime Ministers\n  * 3 Timeline\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 Notes\n  * 6 References\n\n## List of Prime\nMinisters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Sri_Lanka&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: List of Prime Ministers\")]\n\nParties\n\n[United National Party](/wiki/United_National_Party \"United National Party\")\n[Sri Lanka Freedom Party](/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Freedom_Party \"Sri Lanka Freedom\nParty\")\n\nâ | Portrait | Name  \n(BirthâDeath)  \nConstituency/Title | Term of office  \nâ  \nElectoral mandates | Other ministerial offices  \nheld while Prime Minister | Political party  \nof PM  \n(Alliance) | Government | Refs | Governor-General/President  \n(1.
