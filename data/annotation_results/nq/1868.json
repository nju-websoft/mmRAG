The terminology is\noften a source of confusion, partly owing to the similarity between some of\nthe actual words used, but also because they are often used loosely. In\naddition, many of the words carry both geographical and political connotations\nwhich are affected by the history of the islands.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to explain the meanings of and relationships\namong the terms in use; however many of these classifications are contentious\nand are the subject of disagreement (See the [British Isles naming\ndispute](/wiki/British_Isles_naming_dispute \"British Isles naming dispute\")).\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Summary\n    * 1.1 Visual guide\n  * 2 Terminology in detail\n  * 3 Geographical distinctions\n    * 3.1 The British Isles\n      * 3.1.1 Great Britain\n      * 3.1.2 Ireland\n      * 3.1.3 Isle of Man\n      * 3.1.4 Channel Islands\n  * 4 Political terms in more detail\n    * 4.1 The United Kingdom\n    * 4.2 Ireland\n    * 4.3 British Islands\n  * 5 Historical aspects\n    * 5.1 Romans\n    * 5.2 Mediaeval period\n    * 5.3 Renaissance mapmakers\n    * 5.4 18th and 19th centuries\n    * 5.5 Evolution of kingdoms and states\n  * 6 Adjectives\n  * 7 Problems with use of terms\n    * 7.1 British Isles\n    * 7.2 England\n    * 7.3 Europe\n    * 7.4 Great Britain\n    * 7.5 Ireland\n    * 7.6 Ulster\n  * 8 Further information\n    * 8.1 Isle of Man and Channel Islands\n    * 8.2 Celtic names\n    * 8.3 Terms for the British Isles in the Irish language\n  * 9 Slang\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 External links\n\n##\nSummary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Terminology_of_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Summary\")]\n\nThe use of terminology depends on context; words and phrases can generally be\ngrouped into four main areas: geographical, political, linguistic and sporting\nterms. In brief, the main terms and their simple explanations are as follows:\n\n  * Geographical terms: \n    * The [British Isles](/wiki/British_Isles \"British Isles\") is a group of islands in the [Atlantic Ocean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean \"Atlantic Ocean\") off the coast of [Continental Europe](/wiki/Continental_Europe \"Continental Europe\"). It includes [Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\"), [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\"), the [Isle of Man](/wiki/Isle_of_Man \"Isle of Man\"), [Shetland](/wiki/Shetland \"Shetland\"), [Orkney](/wiki/Orkney \"Orkney\"), and [thousands of smaller islands](/wiki/List_of_islands_of_the_British_Isles \"List of islands of the British Isles\"). Traditionally the [Channel Islands](/wiki/Channel_Islands \"Channel Islands\") are included, though these specific islands are geographically closer to mainland continental Europe, being positioned off the French coast of [Normandy](/wiki/Normandy \"Normandy\"). This, in part, has resulted in the term being [disputed](/wiki/British_Isles_naming_dispute \"British Isles naming dispute\").[1][2]\n      * **[Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\")** is the largest island of the [archipelago](/wiki/Archipelago \"Archipelago\").[3][4][5]\n      * **[Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\")** is the second largest island of the archipelago and lies directly to the west of Great Britain. The island of Ireland itself has its own **[list of Irish Isles](/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Ireland \"List of islands of Ireland\")**.\n      * The full **[list of islands of the British Isles](/wiki/List_of_islands_of_the_British_Isles \"List of islands of the British Isles\")** includes over 6,000 islands,[6] of which 51 have an area larger than 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi).\n  * Political terms: \n    * The **[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\")** is the [constitutional monarchy](/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy \"Constitutional monarchy\") occupying the island of Great Britain, the small nearby islands (but not the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands), and the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland. Usually, it is shortened to _United Kingdom_ or _the UK_ , though _Britain_ is also an officially recognised short form. \"Great Britain\" is sometimes used as a short form, and is the name used by the UK in some international organisations.[7] The abbreviation _GB_ is frequently used for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in international agreements, e.g. [Universal Postal Union](/wiki/Universal_Postal_Union \"Universal Postal Union\") and [Road Traffic Convention](/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Traffic \"Vienna Convention on Road Traffic\"), as well as in the [ISO 3166](/wiki/ISO_3166 \"ISO 3166\") country codes (GB and GBR). \"England\" was also formerly used [synecdochically](/wiki/Synecdoche \"Synecdoche\") to refer to the whole United Kingdom, but this usage became rare early in the 20th century.\n    * **[Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\")** is the sovereign republic occupying the larger portion of the island of Ireland. However, to distinguish the state from the island, or to distinguish either of these from [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\"), it is also called \"the Republic of Ireland\" or simply \"the Republic\". Occasionally, its [Irish-language](/wiki/Irish_language \"Irish language\") name, _[Éire](/wiki/%C3%89ire \"Éire\")_ (or _Eire_ without the diacritic), will be used in an English-language context to distinguish it from \"Northern Ireland\", even though the word _Éire_ directly translates as \"Ireland\".\n    * [England](/wiki/England \"England\"), [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\"), [Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\") and [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\") are the four [countries of the United Kingdom](/wiki/Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Countries of the United Kingdom\"), though they are also referred to, especially in sporting contexts, as the [home nations](/wiki/Home_nations \"Home nations\") of the United Kingdom.\n    * [England and Wales](/wiki/England_and_Wales \"England and Wales\"), Scotland, and Northern Ireland are legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom.[8]\n    * [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain#Political_definition \"Great Britain\") means the countries of England, Wales and Scotland considered as a unit.[9][10]\n    * [British Islands](/wiki/British_Islands \"British Islands\") consists of the United Kingdom, the [Channel Islands](/wiki/Channel_Islands \"Channel Islands\") and the [Isle of Man](/wiki/Isle_of_Man \"Isle of Man\"). These are the [polities](/wiki/Polity \"Polity\") within the British Isles that have the [British monarch](/wiki/British_monarch \"British monarch\") as head of state.\n  * Linguistic terms: \n    * The two [sovereign states](/wiki/Sovereign_states \"Sovereign states\") in the region, the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\") and [Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\"), are frequently referred to as _countries_. So too are [England](/wiki/England \"England\"), [Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\"), [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\") and, to a lesser extent, [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\") (as is the whole [island of Ireland](/wiki/Island_of_Ireland \"Island of Ireland\")).\n    * British is an adjective pertaining to the United Kingdom; for example, a [citizen](/wiki/Citizen \"Citizen\") of the UK is called a [British citizen](/wiki/British_citizen \"British citizen\")—but for citizenship purposes \"British\" includes the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.\n    * [Anglo-](/wiki/Anglo- \"Anglo-\") is often used as an adjectival prefix referring to the United Kingdom (notwithstanding that its original meaning is \"English\") particularly in the field of diplomatic relations. It can also refer to the English language, to anglophone peoples and can have a variety of other shades of meaning.\n    * Wales is sometimes called the _[Principality of Wales](/wiki/Principality_of_Wales \"Principality of Wales\")_ , although this has no modern constitutional basis.\n    * Northern Ireland is often referred to as a _province_ or called _Ulster_ , after the [traditional Irish province](/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland \"Provinces of Ireland\") of [Ulster](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\") within which it is located.\n  * Sport \n    * Forms of national representation vary from sport to sport. England, Scotland and Wales often compete separately as _nations_.[11] In some sports—such as [rugby](/wiki/Rugby_football \"Rugby football\") and [cricket](/wiki/Cricket \"Cricket\")—the island of Ireland competes as a nation; in others, most notably [association football](/wiki/Association_football \"Association football\"), Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland field separate teams. In these contexts England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland/Northern Ireland are sometimes described as _the[home nations](/wiki/Home_nations \"Home nations\")_.\n    * [Rugby union](/wiki/Rugby_union \"Rugby union\") players from both Ireland and Great Britain play for [British and Irish Lions](/wiki/British_and_Irish_Lions \"British and Irish Lions\") representing the four \"Home Unions\" of [England](/wiki/Rugby_Football_Union \"Rugby Football Union\"), [Ireland](/wiki/Irish_Rugby_Football_Union \"Irish Rugby Football Union\"), [Scotland](/wiki/Scottish_Rugby_Union \"Scottish Rugby Union\") and [Wales](/wiki/Welsh_Rugby_Union \"Welsh Rugby Union\").\n    * [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\") is sometimes used to mean [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\"). For example, at the [Olympic Games](/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\"), the team called \"Great Britain\" represents Great Britain and Northern Ireland.[12][13] However, athletes from Northern Ireland have, by virtue of their entitlement to dual nationality, the choice of participating in either the Great Britain team or the Republic of Ireland team.[13]\n    * In the majority of individual sports (e.g. [tennis](/wiki/Tennis \"Tennis\") and [athletics](/wiki/Athletics_\\(sport\\) \"Athletics \\(sport\\)\")), at international level competitors are identified as GB if they are from Great Britain or Northern Ireland. A small number of sports (e.g. [golf](/wiki/Golf \"Golf\"), [darts](/wiki/Darts \"Darts\"), [snooker](/wiki/Snooker \"Snooker\")) identify participants as representing their constituent country. In the [Commonwealth Games](/wiki/Commonwealth_Games \"Commonwealth Games\"), England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each compete as separate nations, as do each of the three Crown Dependencies (Ireland is not part of the [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations \"Commonwealth of Nations\") and is not eligible to participate).\n\n### Visual\nguide[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Terminology_of_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Visual guide\")]\n\nBelow is a visual reference guide to some of the main concepts and territories\ndescribed in this article:\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/British_Isles_all.svg/68px-British_Isles_all.svg.png)](/wiki/File:British_Isles_all.svg)\n\nThe [British Isles](/wiki/British_Isles \"British Isles\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/British_Islands.svg/68px-British_Islands.svg.png)](/wiki/File:British_Islands.svg)\n\nThe [British Islands](/wiki/British_Islands \"British Islands\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/British_Isles_United_Kingdom.svg/68px-British_Isles_United_Kingdom.svg.png)](/wiki/File:British_Isles_United_Kingdom.svg)\n\nThe [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United Kingdom\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Great_Britain.svg/68px-Great_Britain.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Great_Britain.svg)\n\n[Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\") (island)\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Island_of_Ireland.svg/68px-Island_of_Ireland.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Island_of_Ireland.svg)\n\n[Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\") (island)\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/British_Isles_England.svg/68px-British_Isles_England.svg.png)](/wiki/File:British_Isles_England.svg)\n\n[England](/wiki/England \"England\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/British_Isles_Scotland.svg/68px-British_Isles_Scotland.svg.png)](/wiki/File:British_Isles_Scotland.svg)\n\n[Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/British_Isles_Wales.svg/68px-British_Isles_Wales.svg.png)](/wiki/File:British_Isles_Wales.svg)\n\n[Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Republic_of_Ireland.svg/68px-Republic_of_Ireland.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Republic_of_Ireland.svg)\n\n[Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/British_Isles_Northern_Ireland.svg/68px-British_Isles_Northern_Ireland.svg.png)](/wiki/File:British_Isles_Northern_Ireland.svg)\n\n[Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/British_Isles_Isle_of_Man.svg/68px-British_Isles_Isle_of_Man.svg.png)](/wiki/File:British_Isles_Isle_of_Man.svg)\n\nThe [Isle of Man](/wiki/Isle_of_Man \"Isle of Man\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/British_Isles_Channel_Islands.svg/68px-British_Isles_Channel_Islands.svg.png)](/wiki/File:British_Isles_Channel_Islands.svg)\n\nThe [Channel Islands](/wiki/Channel_Islands \"Channel Islands\")\n([Jersey](/wiki/Jersey \"Jersey\"), [Guernsey](/wiki/Guernsey \"Guernsey\"))\n\n## Terminology in\ndetail[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Terminology_of_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Terminology in detail\")]\n\n  * **[Britain](/wiki/Britain_\\(name\\) \"Britain \\(name\\)\")** is a political and geographic term which can refer to the [United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\"),[14] or the island of [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\").\n  * **[Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\")** is the [largest island](/wiki/List_of_islands_by_area \"List of islands by area\") in Europe and the [political union](/wiki/Political_union \"Political union\") of three nations, these being:\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  * **[England and Wales](/wiki/England_and_Wales \"England and Wales\")** is a political and administrative term referring to the two [home countries](/wiki/Home_countries \"Home countries\") of England and Wales, which share the same legal system. Between [1746](/wiki/Wales_and_Berwick_Act_1746 \"Wales and Berwick Act 1746\") and [1967](/wiki/Welsh_Language_Act_1967 \"Welsh Language Act 1967\") the term \"England\" did legally include Wales.\n\n    \n\n  * **[England](/wiki/England \"England\")** (see also the historical [Kingdom of England](/wiki/Kingdom_of_England \"Kingdom of England\")).\n  * **[Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\")** (see also the historical [Principality of Wales](/wiki/Principality_of_Wales \"Principality of Wales\")).\n\n  * **[Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\")** (see also the historical [Kingdom of Scotland](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland \"Kingdom of Scotland\"))\n\n    \n\n  * The historical **[Kingdom of Great Britain](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great Britain\")** is Britain for the period 1707–1801.\n  * **Britannia** is the [Roman province of Britain](/wiki/Roman_Britain \"Roman Britain\"), or a poetic reference to later Britain, or a [personification of Britain](/wiki/Britannia \"Britannia\").\n\n  * The **[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\")** , usually shortened to the **United Kingdom** (abbreviation **UK**), is the [sovereign state](/wiki/Sovereign_state \"Sovereign state\") comprising [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain#Political_definition \"Great Britain\") plus **Northern Ireland** since 1927. (The Partition of Ireland took place in 1922, but the consequent change in the official title of the UK was only made by Act of Parliament five years later.) The [United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\") is often shortened to **Britain** , even on official websites.[15][16] A proposal to rename the political entity as the \"[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ulster](/wiki/Alternative_names_for_Northern_Ireland \"Alternative names for Northern Ireland\")\" was formally recommended by civil servants to the Cabinet in 1949 but ultimately rejected.[17]\n\n    \n\n  * The historical **[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\")** was [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain#Political_definition \"Great Britain\") plus [Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\"), for the period 1801 to 1922, although the name change after the secession of the Irish Free State only took place in 1927.\n\n    N.B.: While \"United Kingdom\" is normally abbreviated **UK** , the official [ISO 3166](/wiki/ISO_3166 \"ISO 3166\") two-letter country code is **GB** and the three letter code is **GBR** ([Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine \"Ukraine\") has the two letter code UA and the three letter code UKR). Due to a pre-existing convention originating in the UK's [JANET](/wiki/JANET \"JANET\") academic computer network,[18] the UK's [Internet top-level domain](/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain \"Country code top-level domain\") is **[.uk](/wiki/.uk \".uk\")** , a break from the [TCP/IP](/wiki/TCP/IP \"TCP/IP\") practice of following ISO 3166 (a **[.gb](/wiki/.gb \".gb\")** domain has also been used to a limited extent in the past but is now defunct). **GB** is also used on car number plates to indicate the United Kingdom.\n\n  * **[Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\")** (in [Irish](/wiki/Irish_language \"Irish language\"), _**Éire**_) refers, geographically, to the island of Ireland, or to any of the following:\n\n    _Historically:_\n\n  * The **[Kingdom of Ireland](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland \"Kingdom of Ireland\")** was Ireland for the period 1541–1801. (The [King of Ireland](/wiki/King_of_Ireland \"King of Ireland\") remained Head of State in the Irish Free State and Ireland/Éire until the [Republic of Ireland Act 1948](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948 \"Republic of Ireland Act 1948\") abolished that status).\n  * The **[Irish Republic](/wiki/Irish_Republic \"Irish Republic\")** , established by the [Irish Declaration of Independence](/wiki/Irish_Declaration_of_Independence \"Irish Declaration of Independence\"), was a 32-county republic encompassing the entire island, during the period 1919–22—though its _de facto_ rule did not encompass all of the island. During this period, according to British law, Ireland remained part of the UK though its independence was recognised by [Russia](/wiki/Russia \"Russia\").\n  * **[Southern Ireland](/wiki/Southern_Ireland_\\(1921%E2%80%9322\\) \"Southern Ireland \\(1921–22\\)\")** was a proposed [Home Rule](/wiki/Home_Rule \"Home Rule\") 26-county state under the [Government of Ireland Act 1920](/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920 \"Government of Ireland Act 1920\"). It never came into practical existence, being superseded by:\n  * The **[Irish Free State](/wiki/Irish_Free_State \"Irish Free State\")** is Ireland excepting Northern Ireland during the period 1922–37.\n\n    _Present_ : \n\n  * **Ireland** (in [Irish](/wiki/Irish_language \"Irish language\"), _[Éire](/wiki/%C3%89ire \"Éire\")_) is the political entity consisting of the island of Ireland excepting Northern Ireland, 1937–present. This is the name of the state according to the [Irish Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland \"Constitution of Ireland\") and the United Nations.\n  * The **[Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\")** is a commonly used description of Ireland excepting Northern Ireland, 1949–present. It is also the name used by the international [Association Football](/wiki/Association_Football \"Association Football\") team.\n\n    The terms _Irish Republic_ , _Southern Ireland_ , the _Irish Free State_ , the _Free State_ , the _26 Counties_ and _Éire_ (in English-language texts) have been used synonymously with the _Republic of Ireland_. Of these, _Southern Ireland_ and _Irish Free State_ , in particular, are seen as outdated. \"Eire\" (spelt without the Irish _[fada](/wiki/Acute_accent \"Acute accent\")_) was the British legal spelling from the [Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938](/wiki/Eire_\\(Confirmation_of_Agreements\\)_Act_1938 \"Eire \\(Confirmation of Agreements\\) Act 1938\") until the [Ireland Act 1949](/wiki/Ireland_Act_1949 \"Ireland Act 1949\"), and informally for some years after.\n\n  * **[Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\")** 1922–present. That part of the island of Ireland northeast of the line of partition of 1922, and which is still part of the United Kingdom. [Various alternative names](/wiki/Alternative_names_for_Northern_Ireland \"Alternative names for Northern Ireland\") have been used or proposed for Northern Ireland. It is sometimes referred to as \"the North of Ireland\", \"the Six Counties\" or (in extremist usage) the \"occupied six counties\", especially by [Irish Nationalists](/wiki/Irish_Nationalism \"Irish Nationalism\").\n  * **[Ulster](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\")**. The name of one of Ireland's four traditional [provinces](/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland \"Provinces of Ireland\"). The area contains nine northern counties, six of which make up [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\"), and three of which are part of the [Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\"). It is also often used by [Unionists](/wiki/Unionism_in_Ireland \"Unionism in Ireland\") to refer to the smaller [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\"). Though [Ulster](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\") has not been a political entity since the ancient Gaelic provincial kingdoms, it remains associated with a geographical area and is used in sporting and cultural contexts. See [Ulster (disambiguation)](/wiki/Ulster_\\(disambiguation\\) \"Ulster \\(disambiguation\\)\").\n\n    _In sport_\n\n  * In [Gaelic games](/wiki/Gaelic_games \"Gaelic games\"), no distinction is recognised between the [GAA counties](/wiki/GAA_county \"GAA county\") of the Republic and those of Northern Ireland. County teams play in their provincial championships (where the six counties of Ulster within Northern Ireland and three within the Republic all play in the Ulster championship) and the winners of these play in the All-Ireland championship. Even within Northern Ireland, a tricolour, the [flag of the Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Flag_of_Ireland \"Flag of Ireland\"), is flown at all games. At bigger games, where an anthem is played, it is always [the national anthem of the Republic](/wiki/Amhr%C3%A1n_na_bhFiann \"Amhrán na bhFiann\"). In the case of the [International Rules](/wiki/International_rules_football \"International rules football\") series against [Australia](/wiki/Australia_international_rules_football_team \"Australia international rules football team\"), an Irish national team is chosen from all 32 counties.\n  * In Association Football, the teams correspond to political entities: Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In accordance with [UEFA](/wiki/UEFA \"UEFA\") and [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA \"FIFA\")'s rules, each of these countries has its own football league: the [Irish League](/wiki/Irish_Football_League \"Irish Football League\") and the [League of Ireland](/wiki/League_of_Ireland \"League of Ireland\") respectively.\n  * In [rugby union](/wiki/Rugby_union \"Rugby union\"), [rugby league](/wiki/Rugby_league \"Rugby league\"), [field hockey](/wiki/Field_hockey \"Field hockey\"), [cricket](/wiki/Cricket \"Cricket\"), [boxing](/wiki/Boxing \"Boxing\"), [golf](/wiki/Golf \"Golf\"), [athletics](/wiki/Athletics_\\(sport\\) \"Athletics \\(sport\\)\") and others the _Ireland_ team is drawn from the whole island (i.e. both the Republic and Northern Ireland). Many sports organisations are subdivided along provincial lines e.g. [Gaelic Athletic Association](/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association \"Gaelic Athletic Association\"), [golf](/wiki/Golf \"Golf\").\n\n  * The **[British Isles](/wiki/British_Isles \"British Isles\")** is a term used to mean the island of Great Britain plus the island of Ireland and many smaller surrounding islands, including the [Isle of Man](/wiki/Isle_of_Man \"Isle of Man\") and, in some contexts, the [Channel Islands](/wiki/Channel_Islands \"Channel Islands\") ([Guernsey](/wiki/Guernsey \"Guernsey\") and [Jersey](/wiki/Jersey \"Jersey\")). See [British Isles naming dispute](/wiki/British_Isles_naming_dispute \"British Isles naming dispute\") for details of the conflict over use of this term.\n  * _Great Britain and Ireland_ , or variants like \"Britain and Ireland\" or \"The UK and Ireland\" are sometimes used as alternatives to the term [British Isles](/wiki/British_Isles \"British Isles\").\n  * **Anglo-Celtic Isles** is an alternative term (in limited use) for the geographic region comprising Britain & Ireland, more commonly referred to as the 'British Isles'. 'Anglo-Celtic Islands' is a derivative of this. It is intended as a geographic term free of any political implication and uses the macro-cultural grouping term [Anglo-Celtic](/wiki/Anglo-Celtic \"Anglo-Celtic\"), referring to the peoples from which the majority of the island group's population are descended—the [Anglo-Saxons](/wiki/Anglo-Saxons \"Anglo-Saxons\") and the [Celts](/wiki/Celt \"Celt\") (it can also be inclusive of the [Anglo-Normans](/wiki/Anglo-Normans \"Anglo-Normans\")).\n  * **[Islands of the North Atlantic](/wiki/Islands_of_the_North_Atlantic \"Islands of the North Atlantic\")** is another suggested replacement term for 'British Isles', without the same political connotations.

Geographically,\nit is one island, but [as a political\nentity](/wiki/Great_Britain#Political_definition \"Great Britain\") it also\nincludes the smaller offshore islands that are administered as part of its\nconstituent nations – England, Wales and Scotland – such as England's [Isle of\nWight](/wiki/Isle_of_Wight \"Isle of Wight\"), Wales' [Anglesey](/wiki/Anglesey\n\"Anglesey\") and Scotland's [Inner Hebrides](/wiki/Inner_Hebrides \"Inner\nHebrides\"), [Outer Hebrides](/wiki/Outer_Hebrides \"Outer Hebrides\"), [Orkney\nIslands](/wiki/Orkney_Islands \"Orkney Islands\") and [Shetland\nIslands](/wiki/Shetland_Islands \"Shetland Islands\").\n\nThe abbreviation _GB_ is sometimes officially used for the United Kingdom, for\nexample in the [Olympics](/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\"), or as the\n[vehicle registration\nplate](/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate#International_codes \"Vehicle\nregistration plate\") [country identification\ncode](/wiki/List_of_international_license_plate_codes \"List of international\nlicense plate codes\") for UK-registered cars _(see also[British car number\nplates](/wiki/British_car_number_plates \"British car number plates\"))_. _SCO_\nin Scotland, _CYM_ for Wales (Cymru), _NI_ for Northern Ireland, or _ENG_ for\nEngland can also be used.[21]\n\nThe [internet code](/wiki/Internet_code \"Internet code\") _[.gb](/wiki/.gb\n\".gb\"),_ although allocated to the UK, is virtually unused and UK web domains\nuse _[.uk](/wiki/.uk \".uk\")_.\n\nThe four constituent parts of the UK are also known, particularly in sporting\ncontexts, as _[Home Nations](/wiki/Home_Nations \"Home Nations\")_ or the \"Four\nNations\". The BBC refers to its UK-wide broadcasting operation as _Nations and\nRegions_ [22] (\"regions\" referring to geographic regions of England. Thus the\nUK naming conventions tend towards describing distinct _regions_ or _nations_\nwhich exist within a single sovereign _state_.\n\nIn sport, the UK Nations mostly have their own separate national teams –\nEngland, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, for example in\n[football](/wiki/Football_\\(soccer\\) \"Football \\(soccer\\)\").

The [Northern Ireland national\nteam](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_national_football_team \"Northern Ireland national\nfootball team\") retained the name \"Ireland\" for some fifty years after\npartition. Since around 1970 the two teams have been consistently referred to\nas \"Northern Ireland\" and \"[Republic of\nIreland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team \"Republic of Ireland\nnational football team\")\" respectively. The UK competes as Great Britain at\nthe Olympic Games. According to the Olympic Charter the Olympic Council of\nIreland represents the entire island of Ireland.[23] Olympic athletes from\nNorthern Ireland may choose whether to represent the UK or the [Republic of\nIreland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\").\n\nSince the [Good Friday Agreement](/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement \"Good Friday\nAgreement\") and the subsequent implementation legislation, sporting\norganisation (and several other organisations, e.g.\n[tourism](/wiki/Tourism_in_Ireland \"Tourism in Ireland\"), [Irish\nGaelic](/wiki/Irish_Gaelic \"Irish Gaelic\") and [Ulster\nScots](/wiki/Ulster_Scots_dialects \"Ulster Scots dialects\") language boards)\non the island of Ireland has increasingly been cross-border.\n\nCitizens of the UK are called _British_ , _Brits_ , _Britons_ or _Britisher_\n(archaic).

Some older slang names\nfor Britons are _Tommy_ (for British soldiers) and _Anglo_.\n[Anglo](/wiki/Anglo \"Anglo\") properly refers only to England, but it is\nsometimes used as a broader reference as an element in compound adjectives:\nfor example, \"Anglo-French relations\" may be used in newspaper articles when\nreferring to relations between the political entities [France](/wiki/France\n\"France\") and the United Kingdom. _Anglo-Saxon_ may be used (particularly in\nContinental European languages) when referring to the whole [English-speaking\nworld](/wiki/English-speaking_world \"English-speaking world\").\n\n###\nIreland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Terminology_of_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Ireland\")]\n\nMain article: [Names of the Irish state](/wiki/Names_of_the_Irish_state \"Names\nof the Irish state\")\n\n[![Republic of\nIreland.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Republic_of_Ireland.svg/80px-\nRepublic_of_Ireland.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Republic_of_Ireland.svg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Eirepas.JPG/130px-\nEirepas.JPG)](/wiki/File:Eirepas.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Eirepas.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nAn Irish passport\n\nSince the adoption of the [Constitution of\nIreland](/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland \"Constitution of Ireland\") in 1937,\n**[Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\")** has been the\n[English](/wiki/English_\\(language\\) \"English \\(language\\)\") name of the state\nwhich covers approximately five-sixths of the island of\n[Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\"). The name **[Éire](/wiki/%C3%89ire\n\"Éire\")** is used when writing in [Irish](/wiki/Irish_\\(language\\) \"Irish\n\\(language\\)\").\n\nSince the [Republic of Ireland Act 1948](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948\n\"Republic of Ireland Act 1948\"), the term \"Republic of Ireland\" is the term\nused as the additional _description_ of the state. This term is useful in\navoiding ambiguity between the name of the island and the name of the state.\nHowever, the term \"Ireland\" is always used in formal diplomatic contexts such\nas the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\") or the [United\nNations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\"). The passport of the Republic\nof Ireland bears the name _Éire – Ireland_.\n\nBefore the introduction of the 1937 constitution and the new name, the [Irish\nFree State](/wiki/Irish_Free_State \"Irish Free State\") occupied the same\nterritory as the modern state of Ireland. The Irish Free State became an\nautonomous [dominion](/wiki/Dominion \"Dominion\") of the [British\nEmpire](/wiki/British_Empire \"British Empire\") in 1922 when it seceded from\nthe United Kingdom through the [Anglo-Irish Treaty](/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty\n\"Anglo-Irish Treaty\"). The King ceased to be its Head of State [in\n1936](/wiki/Executive_Authority_\\(External_Relations\\)_Act_1936 \"Executive\nAuthority \\(External Relations\\) Act 1936\") and the state ceased to be a\nDominion and left the Commonwealth [in\n1948](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948 \"Republic of Ireland Act 1948\").\n\nTraditionally, the island of Ireland is divided into four\n[provinces](/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland \"Provinces of Ireland\") –\n[Leinster](/wiki/Leinster \"Leinster\"), [Connacht](/wiki/Connacht \"Connacht\"),\n[Munster](/wiki/Munster \"Munster\") and [Ulster](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\"), with\neach of the provinces further divided into counties. The Republic of Ireland\ntakes up 83% of the island, twenty-six of the thirty-two traditional counties\nof Ireland. Northern Ireland takes up the remaining area, six of the\ntraditional nine counties of Ulster.\n\nOn the island of Ireland the naming of places often raises political issues.\nThe usage of \"Ireland\" as the [official name](/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland\n\"Constitution of Ireland\") of the state causes offence to some\n[Unionists](/wiki/Unionists_\\(Ireland\\) \"Unionists \\(Ireland\\)\") in [Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\"), who believe it implies\nthat the state\n[still](/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland \"Nineteenth\nAmendment of the Constitution of Ireland\") has a territorial claim to the\nwhole island – the terminology of \"Republic of Ireland\" or\n\"[Éire](/wiki/%C3%89ire \"Éire\")\" is much preferred by Northern Irish unionists\nwhen referring to that political state. Similarly, some\n[Nationalists](/wiki/Nationalists_\\(Ireland\\) \"Nationalists \\(Ireland\\)\") in\nNorthern Ireland also prefer to reserve the usage of \"Ireland\" to refer to the\nwhole island.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Irishness is a highly contested identity, with\nfundamentally different perceptions of national identity between unionists\n(who generally perceive themselves as being British) and nationalists (who\ngenerally consider both communities to be part of the Irish nation).[24]\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is often referred to by the\n[Nationalist](/wiki/Irish_nationalists \"Irish nationalists\") and\n[Republican](/wiki/Irish_Republicans \"Irish Republicans\") communities by the\nterm \"the Twenty-six Counties\", with the connotation that the state\nconstituted as such forms only a portion of the ideal political unit of the\n[Irish Republic](/wiki/Irish_Republic \"Irish Republic\"), which would consist\nof all of the [thirty-two counties](/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland \"Counties of\nIreland\") into which the island is divided. The term \"the Six Counties\" (of\nNorthern Ireland) is also used. Other Nationalist terms in use include \"the\nNorth of Ireland\" and \"the North\". These latter are terms also used by the\nIrish national broadcaster [RTÉ](/wiki/Raidi%C3%B3_Teilif%C3%ADs_%C3%89ireann\n\"Raidió Teilifís Éireann\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] More extreme terms for Northern Ireland include\n\"the occupied six counties\" or \"occupied Ireland\", which are often used by\npeople who reject the idea of Northern Ireland as a separate entity from the\nRepublic of Ireland.\n\nThe [Irish passport](/wiki/Irish_passport \"Irish passport\") is available to\nIrish citizens and can also be applied for abroad through Irish Consular\nservices and the local Irish Embassy.

Parts of the [Massaliote Periplus](/wiki/Massaliote_Periplus\n\"Massaliote Periplus\"), a merchants' handbook describing searoutes of the\nsixth century BC, were used in translation in the writings of\n[Avienus](/wiki/Avienus \"Avienus\") around AD 400. Ireland was referred to as\n_Ierne_ (_Insula sacra_ , the _sacred island_ , as the Greeks interpreted it)\n\"inhabited by the race of _Hiberni_ \" (_gens hiernorum_), and Britain as\n_insula Albionum_ , \"island of the [Albions](/wiki/Albion \"Albion\")\".[27]\nSeveral sources from around 150 BC to AD 70 include fragments of the travel\nwritings of the ancient Greek [Pytheas](/wiki/Pytheas \"Pytheas\") around 320\nBC, use the terms _Albion_ and _Ierne_[28][29] and have been described as\nreferring to the British Isles, including Ireland, as the _Prettanic_ or\n_Brettanic Islands_ (Βρεττανικαὶ νῆσοι) or as αἱ Βρεττανιαι, literally \"the\nBritains\".[27][29][30] Greek writers called the peoples of these islands the\nΠρεττανοί, later Bρεττανοί (alternative spellings of this and of all relative\nwords have a single [tau](/wiki/Tau \"Tau\") or a double\n[nu](/wiki/Nu_\\(letter\\) \"Nu \\(letter\\)\")), a name that possibly corresponds\nto the _[Priteni](/wiki/Priteni \"Priteni\")_.[27] These names may have derived\nfrom a \"[Celtic language](/wiki/Celtic_languages \"Celtic languages\")\" term\nwhich may have reached Pytheas from the [Gauls](/wiki/Gaul \"Gaul\")[30] who may\nhave used it as their term for the inhabitants of the islands.\n\nThe Romans called the inhabitants of Gaul (modern [France](/wiki/France\n\"France\")) _Galli_ or _Celtae_ , the latter term deriving from the Greek name\nΚελτοί for a central European people. Antiquarians of the seventeenth century\nwho found language connections developed the idea of a race of\n[Celts](/wiki/Celt \"Celt\") inhabiting the islands, but this term was not used\nby the Greeks or Romans for the inhabitants of Britain or Ireland,[31] nor is\nthere any record of the inhabitants of the British Isles referring to\nthemselves as such. Nevertheless, Roman administration later incorporated the\nprovince of Britannia into the [praetorian prefecture of\nGaul](/wiki/Praetorian_prefecture_of_Gaul \"Praetorian prefecture of Gaul\"), in\ncommon with Hispania, which had Celtiberians.

[Pliny the Elder](/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder \"Pliny the Elder\")\nwriting around AD 70 uses a Latin version of the same terminology in section\n4.102 of his _[Naturalis Historia](/wiki/Pliny%27s_Natural_History \"Pliny's\nNatural History\")_. He writes of Great Britain: _Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum\nBritanniae vocarentur omnes de quibus mox paulo dicemus._ (\"Albion was its own\nname, when all [the islands] were called the Britannias; I will speak of them\nin a moment\"). In the following section, 4.103, Pliny enumerates the islands\nhe considers to make up the Britannias, listing Great Britain, Ireland, and\nmany smaller islands. In his _Geography_ written in the mid 2nd century and\nprobably describing the position around AD 100,[30] [Ptolemy](/wiki/Ptolemy\n\"Ptolemy\") includes both Great Britain (Albion) and Ireland\n([Iwernia](/wiki/Hibernia \"Hibernia\")) in the so called _Bretanic_ island\ngroup. He entitles Book II, Chapter 1 of as _[Iwernia](/wiki/Hibernia\n\"Hibernia\"), Bretanic Island_, and Chapter 2 as _Alwion [sic], Bretanic\nIsland_.[33]\n\nThe name _Albion_ for [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\")\nfell from favour, and the island was described in Greek as Πρεττανία or\nΒρεττανία, in [Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") _Britannia_ , an inhabitant as\nΒρεττανός, _Britannus_ , with the adjective Βρεττανικός, _Britannicus_ ,\nequating to \"British\".[27] With the [Roman conquest of\nBritain](/wiki/Roman_conquest_of_Britain \"Roman conquest of Britain\") the name\n[Britannia](/wiki/Britannia \"Britannia\") was used for the province of [Roman\nBritain](/wiki/Roman_Britain \"Roman Britain\"). The Emperor\n[Claudius](/wiki/Claudius \"Claudius\") was honoured with the\n[agnomen](/wiki/Roman_naming_convention \"Roman naming convention\")\n_Britannicus_ as if he were the conqueror, and coins were struck from AD 46\ninscribed DE BRITAN, DE BRITANN, DE BRITANNI, or DE BRITANNIS. With the visit\nof [Hadrian](/wiki/Hadrian \"Hadrian\") in AD 121 coins introduced a female\nfigure with the label BRITANNIA as a personification or goddess of the place.\nThese and later Roman coins introduced the seated figure of Britannia which\nwould be reintroduced in the 17th century.[34]\n\nIn the later years of Roman rule Britons who left Latin inscriptions, both at\nhome and elsewhere in the Empire, often described themselves as _Brittanus_ or\n_Britto_ , and where describing their citizenship gave it as _cives_ of a\nBritish tribe or of a _patria_ (homeland) of _Britannia_ , not _Roma_.[27]\nFrom the 4th century, many Britons migrated from Roman Britain across the\n[English Channel](/wiki/English_Channel \"English Channel\") and founded\n[Brittany](/wiki/Brittany \"Brittany\").\n\n### Mediaeval\nperiod[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Terminology_of_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Mediaeval period\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Britain_802.jpg/220px-\nBritain_802.jpg)](/wiki/File:Britain_802.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Britain_802.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMap of Britain with part of Ireland in 802\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Hereford_Mappa_Mundi_1300.jpg/220px-\nHereford_Mappa_Mundi_1300.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hereford_Mappa_Mundi_1300.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hereford_Mappa_Mundi_1300.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nHereford Mappa Mundi with the isles in the lower left hand corner.\n\nWhile Latin remained the language of learning, from the early\n[mediaeval](/wiki/Mediaeval \"Mediaeval\") period records begin to appear in\nnative languages.

However, in a specifically physical geographical sense, _British_ is\nused to refer to the island of [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great\nBritain\").[40] The adjectival phrase _Great British_ is very rarely used to\nrefer to [Great Britain](/wiki/Great_Britain \"Great Britain\"), other than to\ncontrive a [pun](/wiki/Pun \"Pun\") on the word _great_ , as in \"Great British\nFood\".\n\n_Irish_ , refers to people or a characteristic \"of Ireland\".[41] As such, its\nmeaning is contextual on the meaning of \"Ireland\" being used: it can relate\nboth to the [Irish state](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\"),\nand to the [island of Ireland](/wiki/Ireland_\\(island\\) \"Ireland \\(island\\)\").\n[Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\"), as a\nconstituent part of the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom \"United\nKingdom\"), can thus be both _British_ or _Irish_ , reflected in the ability\nfor residents of Northern Ireland to take either British or Irish\ncitizenship.[42] In order to be more specific, _Northern Irish_ is therefore\nin common usage. Members of the [Nationalist](/wiki/Irish_Nationalism \"Irish\nNationalism\") communities would not describe themselves as _British_ and would\nonly use the terms _Irish_ , or specifically _Northern Irish_ where needed.\n\nThe term _Ulster_ can also be used as an adjective (e.g. \"[Royal Ulster\nConstabulary](/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary \"Royal Ulster Constabulary\")\"),\nbut this is more likely to be used by [Unionists](/wiki/Unionists_\\(Ireland\\)\n\"Unionists \\(Ireland\\)\") and has political connotations in the same fashion as\nits use as a proper noun (because only six of the traditional nine counties of\n[Ulster](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\"), namely [Antrim](/wiki/County_Antrim \"County\nAntrim\"), [Armagh](/wiki/County_Armagh \"County Armagh\"),\n[Down](/wiki/County_Down \"County Down\"), [Fermanagh](/wiki/County_Fermanagh\n\"County Fermanagh\"), [Londonderry](/wiki/County_Londonderry \"County\nLondonderry\") and [Tyrone](/wiki/County_Tyrone \"County Tyrone\"), are included\nin Northern Ireland with the remaining three counties\n[Cavan](/wiki/County_Cavan \"County Cavan\"), [Donegal](/wiki/County_Donegal\n\"County Donegal\") and [Monaghan](/wiki/County_Monaghan \"County Monaghan\")\nforming part of the Republic).

Likewise,\n[Nationalists](/wiki/Irish_Nationalism \"Irish Nationalism\") might describe,\nsay, a lake in Northern Ireland as _Irish_.\n\nNote that the geographical term [Irish Sea](/wiki/Irish_Sea \"Irish Sea\") thus\nfar appears to have escaped political connotations, even though territorial\ncontrol of the waters of the Irish Sea is divided between both the Republic of\nIreland and the UK, and also includes a British [Crown\ndependency](/wiki/Crown_dependency \"Crown dependency\"), the [Isle of\nMan](/wiki/Isle_of_Man \"Isle of Man\")—as yet there appears to be no\ncontroversy with the term’s usage to mirror that of \"British Isles\".

In a similar way, references\nto England as an island,[56] to an \"English passport\",[57] or to Scottish or\nWelsh places as being in England[57][58] are examples of this usage of the\nterm \"England\".\n\nBecause of the offence likely to be taken by Scots, Welsh and Irish at this\nusage, most politicians and official figures have avoided this usage since the\nearly 20th century. However, there are frequent examples of this usage from\nearlier times.[59][60][61] For a long time it was common for fans of the\n[England football team](/wiki/England_national_football_team \"England national\nfootball team\") to wave the British [Union Flag](/wiki/Union_Flag \"Union\nFlag\")—with the use of the specifically English [St George's\nCross](/wiki/St_George%27s_Cross \"St George's Cross\") flag only gaining\npopularity at the [Euro 96](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_96 \"UEFA Euro 96\") tournament.[57]\n\nThe colloquial usage of \"England\" as a synonym for \"Britain\" is still\nwidespread outside the UK.

The [French](/wiki/French_language \"French\nlanguage\") term \"Bretagne\" now refers to the French \"Little Britain\", not to\nthe British \"Great Britain\", which in French is called _Grande-Bretagne_. In\nclassical times, the [Graeco-Roman](/wiki/Greco-Roman_world \"Greco-Roman\nworld\") geographer [Ptolemy](/wiki/Geography_\\(Ptolemy\\) \"Geography\n\\(Ptolemy\\)\") in his _[Almagest](/wiki/Almagest \"Almagest\")_ also called the\nlarger island _megale Brettania_ (great Britain). At that time, it was in\ncontrast to the smaller island of [Ireland](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\"), which he\ncalled _mikra Brettania_ (little Britain).[62] In his later work\n_[Geography](/wiki/Geography_\\(Ptolemy\\) \"Geography \\(Ptolemy\\)\")_ , Ptolemy\nrefers to Great Britain as _Albion_ and to Ireland as\n_[Iwernia](/wiki/Hibernia \"Hibernia\")_.

The earlier names, [in\ncontrast](/wiki/Exonym_and_endonym \"Exonym and endonym\"), were likely to have\nbeen coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.[63]\n\n###\nIreland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Terminology_of_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=26\n\"Edit section: Ireland\")]\n\nThe word _Ireland_ has two meanings.\n\n  1. It is the official name of [the state](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\") that occupies five sixths of the island, formally named the Republic of Ireland.\n  2. It is a geographical term for [the whole island](/wiki/Ireland \"Ireland\"), which may be referred to as \"the island of Ireland\" to avoid ambiguity.\n\n###\nUlster[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Terminology_of_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=27\n\"Edit section: Ulster\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/IrelandUlster.svg/220px-\nIrelandUlster.svg.png)](/wiki/File:IrelandUlster.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:IrelandUlster.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe traditional province of Ulster on the island of Ireland, showing the\nmodern-day border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland\n\nThe terminology and usage of the name _Ulster_ in Irish and British culture\nvaries. Many within the [unionist](/wiki/Unionist_\\(Ireland\\) \"Unionist\n\\(Ireland\\)\") community[64] and much of the UK press refer to [Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\") as _Ulster_ – whereas the\n[nationalist](/wiki/Irish_nationalism \"Irish nationalism\") community refer to\nthe traditional [Irish province](/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland \"Provinces of\nIreland\") of [Ulster](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\"), which is a nine-county entity\nthat incorporates the three counties of [Donegal](/wiki/County_Donegal \"County\nDonegal\"), [Cavan](/wiki/County_Cavan \"County Cavan\") and\n[Monaghan](/wiki/County_Monaghan \"County Monaghan\") (which are in the\nRepublic) along with the counties of [Armagh](/wiki/County_Armagh \"County\nArmagh\"), [Antrim](/wiki/County_Antrim \"County Antrim\"),\n[Down](/wiki/County_Down \"County Down\"), [Fermanagh](/wiki/County_Fermanagh\n\"County Fermanagh\"), [Londonderry](/wiki/County_Londonderry \"County\nLondonderry\") and [Tyrone](/wiki/Tyrone \"Tyrone\") in Northern Ireland.\n\nThus, the word _Ulster_ has two usages:\n\n  1. It is the name of [one](/wiki/Ulster \"Ulster\") of the four [Provinces of Ireland](/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland \"Provinces of Ireland\"), consisting of the nine northern counties of the island, that was partitioned between the United Kingdom (six counties) and the Republic of Ireland (three counties).\n  2. It is an alternative name for [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\"), used by many in the [Unionist](/wiki/Irish_Unionism \"Irish Unionism\") community. It consists of the six north-eastern counties of the island that remain part of the United Kingdom.\n\n## Further\ninformation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Terminology_of_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Further information\")]\n\n### Isle of Man and Channel\nIslands[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Terminology_of_the_British_Isles&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Isle of Man and Channel Islands\")]\n\nThe Isle of Man and the two [bailiwicks](/wiki/Bailiwick \"Bailiwick\") of the\nChannel Islands are [Crown dependencies](/wiki/Crown_dependencies \"Crown\ndependencies\"); that is, non-sovereign [nations](/wiki/Nation \"Nation\"), self-\ngoverning but whose sovereignty is held by the British [Crown](/wiki/The_Crown\n\"The Crown\").
