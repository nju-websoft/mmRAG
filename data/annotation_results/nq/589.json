The verse is based\non the second movement (_Adagio sostenuto_) of [Sergei\nRachmaninoff](/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff \"Sergei Rachmaninoff\")'s _[Piano\nConcerto No. 2 in C minor](/wiki/Piano_Concerto_No._2_\\(Rachmaninoff\\) \"Piano\nConcerto No. 2 \\(Rachmaninoff\\)\")_ , Opus 18. The chorus is borrowed from the\nsong \"[Let's Pretend](/wiki/Let%27s_Pretend_\\(Raspberries_song\\) \"Let's\nPretend \\(Raspberries song\\)\")\", which Carmen wrote and recorded with the\n[Raspberries](/wiki/Raspberries_\\(band\\) \"Raspberries \\(band\\)\") in 1972.[5]\n\nThe song was the first released on Carmen's [first solo\nLP](/wiki/Eric_Carmen_\\(1975_album\\) \"Eric Carmen \\(1975 album\\)\") after\nleaving the [power pop](/wiki/Power_pop \"Power pop\") group the\n[Raspberries](/wiki/Raspberries_\\(band\\) \"Raspberries \\(band\\)\") and was\nreleased as the first single in December 1975, to great acclaim. It reached\nnumber 2 on the [_Billboard_ Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot\n100\") behind [The Miracles](/wiki/The_Miracles \"The Miracles\")' \"[Love\nMachine](/wiki/Love_Machine_\\(The_Miracles_song\\) \"Love Machine \\(The Miracles\nsong\\)\")\" and [The Four Seasons](/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_\\(band\\) \"The Four\nSeasons \\(band\\)\")' \"[December, 1963 (Oh What a\nNight)](/wiki/December,_1963_\\(Oh,_What_a_Night\\) \"December, 1963 \\(Oh, What a\nNight\\)\")\", number 1 on _[Cash Box](/wiki/Cash_Box \"Cash Box\")_ Top 100\nSingles and number 3 in Canada. The single sold more than one million copies\nin the United States and was certified gold by the\n[RIAA](/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America \"Recording Industry\nAssociation of America\") in April 1976.[6] \"All By Myself\" was Carmen's first\nof eight US Top 40 hits. In the UK, however, this was his only Top 40 success,\npeaking at number 12. In a 2006 poll for UK's [Five](/wiki/Channel_5_\\(UK\\)\n\"Channel 5 \\(UK\\)\") programme _Britain 's Favourite Break-up Songs_, Eric\nCarmen's version of this song was voted seventeenth.\n\nRachmaninoff's music was in the [public domain](/wiki/Public_domain \"Public\ndomain\") in the United States and Carmen thought no copyright existed on it,\nbut it was still protected outside the U.S. Subsequent to the release of the\nalbum, he was contacted by the Rachmaninoff estate and informed otherwise.[7]\nAn agreement was reached in which the estate would receive 12 percent of the\nroyalties from \"All by Myself\" as well as from \"[Never Gonna Fall in Love\nAgain](/wiki/Never_Gonna_Fall_in_Love_Again \"Never Gonna Fall in Love\nAgain\")\", which was based on the third movement from Rachmaninoff's _[Symphony\nNo. 2](/wiki/Symphony_No._2_\\(Rachmaninoff\\) \"Symphony No. 2\n\\(Rachmaninoff\\)\")_.[8][9]\n\nCarmen has stated that he also incorporated part of another melody into this\nsong. The melody was taken from his previous hit with the\n[Raspberries](/wiki/Raspberries_\\(band\\) \"Raspberries \\(band\\)\"), \"[Let's\nPretend](/wiki/Let%27s_Pretend_\\(Raspberries_song\\) \"Let's Pretend\n\\(Raspberries song\\)\").\"[10]\n\nCarmen's original version has spawned numerous cover versions by such artists\nas [Rico J.

It contains fragments from Dion's photo session for the _Falling into\nYou_ album cover and some scenes from her _[Live à\nParis](/wiki/Live_%C3%A0_Paris \"Live à Paris\")_ concert. It was made for the\nsingle version and it was directed by Nigel Dick. The second version was made\nfor the UK market with the same white T-shirt scenes but adding footage of a\nyoung couple in love at Christmas time, instead of scenes from Dion's concert.\nThis was made for the album version. Finally, a live music video was released\nin March 1997 in North America (from the 1996 concert in Montreal).\n\nDion performed this song many times during world tours, TV shows and music\nevents such as the [Grammy Awards](/wiki/Grammy_Award \"Grammy Award\") (1997),\n[Billboard Music Awards](/wiki/Billboard_Music_Award \"Billboard Music Award\")\n(1997) and [Bambi Awards](/wiki/Bambi_\\(prize\\) \"Bambi \\(prize\\)\") (1996).

It\nwas added to the _Falling into You_ Latin American/Spanish edition, and as a\nB-side to other singles from that album. This version became available\nworldwide on Dion's later compilation _[The Collector's Series, Volume\nOne](/wiki/The_Collector%27s_Series,_Volume_One \"The Collector's Series,\nVolume One\")_. The CD single was released in 1996 in Brazil only. Dion's \"Sola\notra vez\" was selected the number one Spanish language cover of an English pop\nsong by TheSpanishVersion.Org.[31]\n\nThe \"All by Myself\" single became one of Dion's biggest hits in the United\nStates, reaching number 1 on the [Hot Adult Contemporary\nTracks](/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_\\(chart\\) \"Adult Contemporary \\(chart\\)\")\n(for three weeks) and the [Latin Pop Airplay](/wiki/Latin_Pop_Airplay \"Latin\nPop Airplay\") (two weeks). It peaked at number 4 on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") (number 7 on the [Billboard\nHot 100 Airplay](/wiki/Hot_100_Airplay_\\(Radio_Songs\\) \"Hot 100 Airplay\n\\(Radio Songs\\)\") and number 5 on the [Hot 100 Singles\nSales](/wiki/Hot_100_Singles_Sales \"Hot 100 Singles Sales\")). It was also a\ntop 10 hit in France, United Kingdom, Wallonia in Belgium and the Republic of\nIreland. In Canada, \"All by Myself\" was released as a promotional single only,\nhitting number 1 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. \"All by Myself\" was\ncertified gold in the US (500,000), and silver in the UK (200,000) and France\n(165,000).\n\nThe track was included on some editions of Dion's greatest hits _[All the\nWay... A Decade of Song](/wiki/All_the_Way..._A_Decade_of_Song \"All the Way...\nA Decade of Song\")_ in 1999 and on _[My Love: Essential\nCollection](/wiki/My_Love:_Essential_Collection \"My Love:

Critical reception\")]\n\nDion's cover received positive reviews. _New York Times_ editor Stephen Holden\nwrote that the remake, along with \"Because You Loved Me,\" \"are the strongest\ncuts on an album crammed with formulaic romantic bombast.\"[32] Dave Sholin\nfrom the _[Gavin Report](/wiki/Gavin_Report \"Gavin Report\")_ commented:\n\"Demand by both programmers and the public for this rendition of Eric Carmen's\n1976 smash made it the obvious choice to be the third single lifted off\nCeline's multi-platinum and Grammy-nominated album, Falling Into You.\"[33]\nMusic.uk.launch.yahoo.com editor Dan Leroy wrote: \"Trying to out-emote Eric\nCarmen was almost crazy enough to work.\"[34] _Entertainment Weekly_ editor\nChuck Eddy said:\" ...But only in her desolate cover of Eric Carmen's _All by\nMyself_ does she truly crash through the glass ceiling of passion.\"[35]\n\n### Charts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=All_by_Myself&action=edit&section=7
