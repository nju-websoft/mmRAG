The Louisiana territory included land\nfrom fifteen present [U.S. states](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S. state\") and two\n[Canadian provinces](/wiki/Canadian_provinces \"Canadian provinces\"). The\nterritory contained land that forms [Arkansas](/wiki/Arkansas \"Arkansas\"),\n[Missouri](/wiki/Missouri \"Missouri\"), [Iowa](/wiki/Iowa \"Iowa\"),\n[Oklahoma](/wiki/Oklahoma \"Oklahoma\"), [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\"), and\n[Nebraska](/wiki/Nebraska \"Nebraska\"); the portion of\n[Minnesota](/wiki/Minnesota \"Minnesota\") west of the [Mississippi\nRiver](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\"); a large portion of [North\nDakota](/wiki/North_Dakota \"North Dakota\"); a large portion of [South\nDakota](/wiki/South_Dakota \"South Dakota\"); the northeastern section of [New\nMexico](/wiki/New_Mexico \"New Mexico\"); the northern portion of\n[Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\"); the area of [Montana](/wiki/Montana \"Montana\"),\n[Wyoming](/wiki/Wyoming \"Wyoming\"), and [Colorado](/wiki/Colorado \"Colorado\")\neast of the [Continental Divide](/wiki/Continental_Divide_of_the_Americas\n\"Continental Divide of the Americas\"); [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana\n\"Louisiana\") west of the Mississippi River (plus [New\nOrleans](/wiki/%C3%8Ele_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans,_Louisiana \"Île d'Orléans,\nLouisiana\")); and small portions of land within the present Canadian provinces\nof [Alberta](/wiki/Alberta \"Alberta\") and [Saskatchewan](/wiki/Saskatchewan\n\"Saskatchewan\"). Its non-native population was around 60,000 inhabitants, of\nwhom half were [African slaves](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States \"Slavery in\nthe United States\").[1]\n\nThe [Kingdom of France](/wiki/Early_modern_France \"Early modern France\")\ncontrolled the Louisiana territory from 1699 until it was\n[ceded](/wiki/Treaty_of_Fontainebleau_\\(1762\\) \"Treaty of Fontainebleau\n\\(1762\\)\") to [Spain](/wiki/Spanish_Empire \"Spanish Empire\") in 1762. In 1800,\n[Napoleon](/wiki/Napoleon \"Napoleon\"), then the First Consul of the French\nRepublic, hoping to re-establish an empire in North America, regained\nownership of Louisiana. However, France's failure to put down the [revolt in\nSaint-Domingue](/wiki/Haitian_Revolution \"Haitian Revolution\"), coupled with\nthe prospect of renewed warfare with the United Kingdom, prompted Napoleon to\nsell Louisiana to the United States to fund his military. The Americans\noriginally sought to purchase only the port city of [New\nOrleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\") and its adjacent coastal lands, but\nquickly accepted the bargain. The Louisiana Purchase occurred during the term\nof the third [President of the United\nStates](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\"), [Thomas Jefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\").\nBefore the purchase was finalized, the decision faced [Federalist\nParty](/wiki/Federalist_Party \"Federalist Party\") opposition; they argued that\nit was unconstitutional to acquire any territory. Jefferson agreed that the\n[U.S. Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States\nConstitution\") did not contain explicit provisions for acquiring territory,\nbut he asserted that his constitutional power to negotiate treaties was\nsufficient.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Negotiation\n  * 3 Domestic opposition and constitutionality\n  * 4 Treaty signing\n  * 5 Formal transfers and initial organization\n  * 6 Boundaries\n  * 7 Slavery\n  * 8 Asserting U.S. possession\n  * 9 Financing\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n    * 11.1 Footnotes\n    * 11.2 Works cited\n  * 12 Further reading\n  * 13 External links\n\n## Background\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Louisiana1804a.jpg/220px-\nLouisiana1804a.jpg)](/wiki/File:Louisiana1804a.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Louisiana1804a.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1804 map of \"[Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana_\\(New_France\\) \"Louisiana \\(New\nFrance\\)\")\", edged on the west by the [Rocky Mountains](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains\n\"Rocky Mountains\")\n\nThroughout the second half of the 18th century, Louisiana was a pawn on the\nchessboard of European politics.[2] It was controlled by the French, who had a\nfew small settlements along the Mississippi and other main rivers. France\nceded the territory to Spain in the secret [Treaty of Fontainebleau\n(1762)](/wiki/Treaty_of_Fontainebleau_\\(1762\\) \"Treaty of Fontainebleau\n\\(1762\\)\"). Following French defeat in the [Seven Years'\nWar](/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War \"Seven Years' War\"), Spain gained control of\n[the territory](/wiki/Louisiana_\\(New_France\\) \"Louisiana \\(New France\\)\")\nwest of the Mississippi and the British the territory to the east of the\nriver.[3]\n\nFollowing the establishment of the United States, the Americans controlled the\narea east of the Mississippi and north of New Orleans. The main issue for the\nAmericans was free transit of the Mississippi to the sea. As the lands were\nbeing gradually settled by a few American migrants, many Americans, including\nJefferson, assumed that [the territory](/wiki/Louisiana_\\(New_Spain\\)\n\"Louisiana \\(New Spain\\)\") would be acquired \"piece by piece.\" The risk of\nanother power taking it from a weakened Spain made a \"profound\nreconsideration\" of this policy necessary.[2] New Orleans was already\nimportant for shipping agricultural goods to and from the areas of the United\nStates west of the [Appalachian Mountains](/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains\n\"Appalachian Mountains\"). [Pinckney's Treaty](/wiki/Pinckney%27s_Treaty\n\"Pinckney's Treaty\"), signed with Spain on October 27, 1795, gave American\nmerchants \"right of deposit\" in New Orleans, granting them use of the port to\nstore goods for export. Americans used this right to transport products such\nas flour, tobacco, pork, bacon, lard, feathers, cider, butter, and cheese. The\ntreaty also recognized American rights to navigate the entire Mississippi,\nwhich had become vital to the growing trade of the western territories.[3]\n\nIn 1798, Spain revoked the treaty allowing American use of New Orleans,\ngreatly upsetting Americans. In 1801, Spanish Governor Don [Juan Manuel de\nSalcedo](/wiki/Juan_Manuel_de_Salcedo \"Juan Manuel de Salcedo\") took over from\nthe [Marquess of Casa\nCalvo](/wiki/List_of_colonial_governors_of_Louisiana#Spanish_period \"List of\ncolonial governors of Louisiana\"), and restored the American right to deposit\ngoods. However, in 1800 Spain had ceded the Louisiana territory back to France\nas part of [Napoleon](/wiki/Napoleon \"Napoleon\")'s secret [Third Treaty of San\nIldefonso](/wiki/Third_Treaty_of_San_Ildefonso \"Third Treaty of San\nIldefonso\").[4] The territory nominally remained under Spanish control, until\na transfer of power to [France](/wiki/French_First_Republic \"French First\nRepublic\") on 30 November 1803, just three weeks before the formal cession of\nthe territory to the United States on 20 December 1803.[5] A further ceremony\nwas held in [St. Louis](/wiki/St._Louis \"St. Louis\"), [Upper\nLouisiana](/wiki/Illinois_Country \"Illinois Country\") regarding the [New\nOrleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\") formalities. The 9–10 March 1804\nevent is remembered as [Three Flags Day](/wiki/Three_Flags_Day \"Three Flags\nDay\").[6][7]\n\n[James Monroe](/wiki/James_Monroe \"James Monroe\") and [Robert R.\nLivingston](/wiki/Robert_R._Livingston_\\(chancellor\\) \"Robert R. Livingston\n\\(chancellor\\)\") had traveled to [Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\") to negotiate the\npurchase of New Orleans in January 1803. Their instructions were to negotiate\nor purchase control of New Orleans and its environs; they did not anticipate\nthe much larger acquisition which would follow.[8]\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase was by far the largest territorial gain in U.S.\nhistory. Stretching from the [Mississippi River](/wiki/Mississippi_River\n\"Mississippi River\") to the [Rocky Mountains](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains \"Rocky\nMountains\"), the purchase doubled the size of the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"). Before 1803, Louisiana had been\nunder [Spanish control](/wiki/Louisiana_\\(New_Spain\\) \"Louisiana \\(New\nSpain\\)\") for forty years. Although Spain aided the\n[rebels](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies \"Thirteen Colonies\") in the [American\nRevolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary\nWar\"), the Spanish didn't want the Americans to settle in their territory.[9]\n\nAlthough the purchase was thought of by some as unjust and unconstitutional,\nJefferson determined that his constitutional power to negotiate treaties\nallowed the purchase of what became fifteen states. In hindsight, the\nLouisiana Purchase could be considered one of his greatest contributions to\nthe United States.[10] On April 18, 1802, Jefferson penned a letter to United\nStates Ambassador to France Robert Livingston. It was an intentional\nexhortation to make this supposedly mild diplomat strongly warn the French of\ntheir perilous course. The letter began:\n\n> The cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France works most\n> sorely on the U.S. On this subject the Secretary of State has written to you\n> fully. Yet I cannot forbear recurring to it personally, so deep is the\n> impression it makes in my mind. It completely reverses all the political\n> relations of the U.S. and will form a new epoch in our political course. Of\n> all nations of any consideration France is the one which hitherto has\n> offered the fewest points on which we could have any conflict of right, and\n> the most points of a communion of interests. From these causes we have ever\n> looked to her as our natural friend, as one with which we never could have\n> an occasion of difference. Her growth therefore we viewed as our own, her\n> misfortunes ours. There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of\n> which is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans, through which\n> the produce of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market, and from\n> its fertility it will ere long yield more than half of our whole produce and\n> contain more than half our inhabitants. France placing herself in that door\n> assumes to us the attitude of defiance. Spain might have retained it quietly\n> for years. Her pacific dispositions, her feeble state, would induce her to\n> increase our facilities there, so that her possession of the place would be\n> hardly felt by us, and it would not perhaps be very long before some\n> circumstance might arise which might make the cession of it to us the price\n> of something of more worth to her. Not so can it ever be in the hands of\n> France. The impetuosity of her temper, the energy and restlessness of her\n> character, placed in a point of eternal friction with us...\n\nJefferson's letter went on with the same heat to a much quoted passage about\n\"the day that France takes possession of New Orleans.\" Not only did he say\nthat day would be a low point in France's history, for it would seal America's\nmarriage with the British fleet and nation, but he added, astonishingly, that\nit would start a massive shipbuilding program.[11]\n\n## Negotiation\n\nWhile the transfer of the territory by Spain back to France in 1800 went\nlargely unnoticed, fear of an eventual French invasion spread nationwide when,\nin 1801, Napoleon sent a military force to secure New Orleans. Southerners\nfeared that Napoleon would free all the slaves in Louisiana, which could\ntrigger slave uprisings elsewhere.[12] Though Jefferson urged moderation,\nFederalists sought to use this against Jefferson and called for hostilities\nagainst France. Undercutting them, Jefferson took up the banner and threatened\nan alliance with the [United\nKingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Ireland\"), although relations were uneasy in that\ndirection.[12] In 1801 Jefferson supported France in its plan to take back\n[Saint-Domingue](/wiki/Saint-Domingue \"Saint-Domingue\") (present-day\n[Haiti](/wiki/Haiti \"Haiti\")), which was then under control of [Toussaint\nLouverture](/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture \"Toussaint Louverture\") after a [slave\nrebellion](/wiki/Slave_rebellion \"Slave rebellion\").\n\nJefferson sent Livingston to Paris in 1801[13] after discovering the transfer\nof Louisiana from Spain to France under the [Third Treaty of San\nIldefonso](/wiki/Third_Treaty_of_San_Ildefonso \"Third Treaty of San\nIldefonso\"). Livingston was authorized to purchase New Orleans.\n\nIn January 1802, France sent [General Charles Leclerc](/wiki/Charles_Leclerc\n\"Charles Leclerc\") to [Saint-Domingue](/wiki/Saint-Domingue \"Saint-Domingue\")\n(present-day [Haiti](/wiki/Haiti \"Haiti\")) to [re-establish\nslavery](/wiki/Saint-Domingue_expedition \"Saint-Domingue expedition\"), which\nhad been abolished by the [constitution of the French Republic of\n1795](/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Year_III \"Constitution of the Year III\"), as\nwell as to reduce the rights of [free people of\ncolor](/wiki/Free_people_of_color \"Free people of color\") and take back\ncontrol of the island from [Toussaint Louverture](/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture\n\"Toussaint Louverture\"). Louverture had fended off invasions of St. Domingue\nby the Spanish and British empires, but had also begun to consolidate power\nfor himself on the island. Before the Revolution, France had derived enormous\nwealth from St. Domingue at the cost of the lives and freedom of the slaves.\nNapoleon wanted its revenues and productivity for France restored. Alarmed\nover the French actions and its intention to re-establish an empire in North\nAmerica, Jefferson declared neutrality in relation to the\n[Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean \"Caribbean\"), refusing credit and other assistance\nto the French, but allowing war contraband to get through to the rebels to\nprevent France from regaining a foothold.[14]\n\nIn November 1803, France withdrew its 7,000 surviving troops from [Saint-\nDomingue](/wiki/Saint-Domingue \"Saint-Domingue\") (more than two-thirds of its\ntroops died there) and gave up its ambitions in the [Western\nHemisphere](/wiki/Western_Hemisphere \"Western Hemisphere\").[15] In 1804 Haiti\ndeclared its independence; but, fearing a slave revolt at home, Jefferson and\nCongress refused to recognize the new republic, the second in the Western\nHemisphere, and imposed a trade [embargo](/wiki/Embargo \"Embargo\") against it.\nThis, together with later claims by France to reconquer Haiti, encouraged by\nthe United Kingdom, made it more difficult for Haiti to recover after ten\nyears of wars.[16]\n\nIn 1803, [Pierre Samuel du Pont de\nNemours](/wiki/Pierre_Samuel_du_Pont_de_Nemours \"Pierre Samuel du Pont de\nNemours\"), a French nobleman, began to help negotiate with France at the\nrequest of Jefferson. Du Pont was living in the United States at the time and\nhad close ties to Jefferson as well as the prominent politicians in France. He\nengaged in back-channel diplomacy with Napoleon on Jefferson's behalf during a\nvisit to France and originated the idea of the much larger Louisiana Purchase\nas a way to defuse potential conflict between the United States and Napoleon\nover North America.[17]\n\nJefferson disliked the idea of purchasing Louisiana from France, as that could\nimply that France had a right to be in Louisiana. Jefferson had concerns that\na U.S. president did not have the constitutional authority to make such a\ndeal. He also thought that to do so would erode [states'\nrights](/wiki/States%27_rights \"States' rights\") by increasing federal\nexecutive power. On the other hand, he was aware of the potential threat that\nFrance could be in that region and was prepared to go to war to prevent a\nstrong French presence there.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThroughout this time, Jefferson had up-to-date intelligence on Napoleon's\nmilitary activities and intentions in North America. Part of his evolving\nstrategy involved giving du Pont some information that was withheld from\nLivingston. He also gave intentionally conflicting instructions to the\ntwo.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] Desperate to avoid possible war with France, Jefferson sent [James\nMonroe](/wiki/James_Monroe \"James Monroe\") to [Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\") in\n1803 to negotiate a settlement, with instructions to go to\n[London](/wiki/London \"London\") to negotiate an alliance if the talks in Paris\nfailed. Spain procrastinated until late 1802 in executing the treaty to\ntransfer [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana_\\(New_Spain\\) \"Louisiana \\(New Spain\\)\")\nto [France](/wiki/French_First_Republic \"French First Republic\"), which\nallowed American hostility to build. Also, Spain's refusal to cede\n[Florida](/wiki/Spanish_Florida \"Spanish Florida\") to France meant that\nLouisiana would be indefensible. Monroe had been formally expelled from France\non his last diplomatic mission, and the choice to send him again conveyed a\nsense of seriousness.\n\nNapoleon needed peace with the United Kingdom to implement the [Treaty of San\nIldefonso](/wiki/Third_Treaty_of_San_Ildefonso \"Third Treaty of San\nIldefonso\") and take possession of Louisiana. Otherwise, Louisiana would be an\neasy prey for the UK or even for the United States. But in early 1803,\ncontinuing war between France and the UK seemed unavoidable. On March 11,\n1803, Napoleon began preparing to invade the UK.\n\nAs Napoleon had failed to re-enslave the emancipated population of Haiti, he\nabandoned his plans to rebuild France's [New World](/wiki/New_World \"New\nWorld\") empire. Without sufficient revenues from [sugar](/wiki/Sugar_cane\n\"Sugar cane\") colonies in the [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean \"Caribbean\"),\nLouisiana had little value to him. Spain had not yet completed the transfer of\nLouisiana to France, and war between France and the UK was imminent. Out of\nanger towards Spain and the unique opportunity to sell something that was\nuseless and not truly his yet, Napoleon decided to sell the entire\nterritory.[18]\n\nAlthough the [foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_\\(France\\)\n\"Ministry of Foreign Affairs \\(France\\)\")\n[Talleyrand](/wiki/Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand \"Charles Maurice de\nTalleyrand\") opposed the plan, on April 10, 1803, Napoleon told the Treasury\nMinister [François de Barbé-Marbois](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Barb%C3%A9-Marbois\n\"François de Barbé-Marbois\") that he was considering selling the entire\nLouisiana Territory to the United States. On April 11, 1803, just days before\nMonroe's arrival, Barbé-Marbois offered Livingston all of Louisiana for $15\nmillion,[19] (equivalent to about $300 million in 2016 dollars,[20]) which\naverages to less than three cents per acre (7 ¢/ha).[21][22]\n\nThe American representatives were prepared to pay up to $10 million for New\nOrleans and its environs, but were dumbfounded when the vastly larger\nterritory was offered for $15 million. Jefferson had authorized Livingston\nonly to purchase New Orleans. However, Livingston was certain that the United\nStates would accept the offer.[23]\n\nThe Americans thought that Napoleon might withdraw the offer at any time,\npreventing the United States from acquiring New Orleans, so they agreed and\nsigned the Louisiana Purchase Treaty on April 30, 1803. On July 4, 1803, the\ntreaty reached [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\").\nThe Louisiana Territory was vast, stretching from the [Gulf of\nMexico](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of Mexico\") in the south to [Rupert's\nLand](/wiki/Rupert%27s_Land \"Rupert's Land\") in the north, and from the\nMississippi River in the east to the [Rocky Mountains](/wiki/Rocky_Mountains\n\"Rocky Mountains\") in the west. Acquiring the territory would double the size\nof the United States, at a sum of less than 3 cents per acre.\n\n## Domestic opposition and constitutionality\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Louisiana_purchase_treaty.jpg/220px-\nLouisiana_purchase_treaty.jpg)](/wiki/File:Louisiana_purchase_treaty.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Louisiana_purchase_treaty.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe original treaty of the Louisiana Purchase\n\n[Henry Adams](/wiki/Henry_Adams \"Henry Adams\") and other historians have\nargued that Jefferson acted hypocritically with the Louisiana Purchase, due to\nhis position as a [strict constructionist](/wiki/Strict_constructionism\n\"Strict constructionism\") regarding the Constitution since he stretched the\nintent of that document to justify his purchase.[24] This argument goes as\nfollows:\n\nThe American purchase of the Louisiana territory was not accomplished without\ndomestic opposition. Jefferson's philosophical consistency was in question\nbecause of his strict interpretation of the Constitution. Many people believed\nthat he and others, including [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James\nMadison\"), were doing something they surely would have argued against with\n[Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\"). The\n[Federalists](/wiki/Federalist_Party \"Federalist Party\") strongly opposed the\npurchase, favoring close relations with Britain over closer ties to Napoleon,\nand were concerned that the United States had paid a large sum of money just\nto declare war on Spain.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nBoth Federalists and Jeffersonians were concerned over the purchase's\nconstitutionality. Many members of the House of Representatives opposed the\npurchase. Majority Leader [John Randolph](/wiki/John_Randolph_of_Roanoke \"John\nRandolph of Roanoke\") led the opposition. The House called for a vote to deny\nthe request for the purchase, but it failed by two votes, 59–57. The\nFederalists even tried to prove the land belonged to Spain, not France, but\navailable records proved otherwise.[25]\n\nThe Federalists also feared that the power of the [Atlantic\nseaboard](/wiki/Atlantic_seaboard \"Atlantic seaboard\") states would be\nthreatened by the new citizens in the West, whose political and economic\npriorities were bound to conflict with those of the merchants and bankers of\n[New England](/wiki/New_England \"New England\"). There was also concern that an\nincrease in the number of slave-holding states created out of the new\nterritory would exacerbate divisions between North and South as well. A group\nof Northern Federalists led by Senator [Timothy\nPickering](/wiki/Timothy_Pickering \"Timothy Pickering\") of Massachusetts went\nso far as to explore the idea of a separate northern confederacy.\n\nAnother concern was whether it was proper to grant citizenship to the French,\nSpanish, and free black people living in New Orleans, as the treaty would\ndictate. Critics in Congress worried whether these \"foreigners\", unacquainted\nwith democracy, could or should become citizens.[26]\n\nSpain protested the transfer on two grounds: First, France had previously\npromised in a note not to alienate Louisiana to a third party and second,\nFrance had not fulfilled the [Third Treaty of San\nIldefonso](/wiki/Third_Treaty_of_San_Ildefonso \"Third Treaty of San\nIldefonso\") by having the King of [Etruria](/wiki/Etruria \"Etruria\")\nrecognized by all European powers. The French government replied that these\nobjections were baseless since the promise not to alienate Louisiana was not\nin the treaty of San Ildefonso itself and therefore had no legal force, and\nthe Spanish government had ordered Louisiana to be transferred in October 1802\ndespite knowing for months that Britain had not recognized the King of Etruria\nin the [Treaty of Amiens](/wiki/Treaty_of_Amiens \"Treaty of Amiens\").[27]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Louisianatransfer_exposition1904_vc180.jpg/220px-\nLouisianatransfer_exposition1904_vc180.jpg)](/wiki/File:Louisianatransfer_exposition1904_vc180.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Louisianatransfer_exposition1904_vc180.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Transfer of Louisiana_ by Ford P. Kaiser for the [Louisiana Purchase\nExposition](/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase_Exposition \"Louisiana Purchase\nExposition\") (1904)\n\n[Henry Adams](/wiki/Henry_Adams \"Henry Adams\") claimed \"The sale of Louisiana\nto the United States was trebly invalid; if it were French property, Bonaparte\ncould not constitutionally alienate it without the consent of the French\n[Chambers](/wiki/S%C3%A9nat_conservateur \"Sénat conservateur\"); if it were\nSpanish property, he could not alienate it at all; if Spain had a right of\nreclamation, his sale was worthless.\"[28] The sale of course was not\n\"worthless\"—the U.S. actually did take possession. Furthermore, the Spanish\nprime minister had authorized the U.S. to negotiate with the French government\n\"the acquisition of territories which may suit their interests.\" Spain turned\nthe territory over to France in a ceremony in New Orleans on November 30, a\nmonth before France turned it over to American officials.[29]\n\nOther historians counter the above arguments regarding Jefferson's alleged\nhypocrisy by asserting that countries change their borders in two ways: (1)\nconquest, or (2) an agreement between nations, otherwise known as a treaty.\nThe Louisiana Purchase was the latter, a treaty. The Constitution specifically\ngrants the president the power to negotiate treaties (Art. II, Sec. 2), which\nis just what Jefferson did.[30]\n\nJefferson's [Secretary of State](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State\n\"United States Secretary of State\"), [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison\n\"James Madison\") (the \"Father of the Constitution\"), assured Jefferson that\nthe Louisiana Purchase was well within even the strictest interpretation of\nthe Constitution. Treasury Secretary [Albert Gallatin](/wiki/Albert_Gallatin\n\"Albert Gallatin\") added that since the power to negotiate treaties was\nspecifically granted to the president, the only way extending the country's\nterritory by treaty could _not_ be a presidential power would be if it were\nspecifically excluded by the Constitution (which it was not). Jefferson, as a\nstrict constructionist, was right to be concerned about staying within the\nbounds of the Constitution, but felt the power of these arguments and was\nwilling to \"acquiesce with satisfaction\" if the Congress approved the\ntreaty.[31]\n\nThe [Senate](/wiki/U.S._Senate \"U.S. Senate\") quickly ratified the treaty, and\nthe [House](/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives \"U.S. House of\nRepresentatives\"), with equal alacrity, authorized the required funding, as\nthe Constitution specifies.[32][33]\n\nThe opposition of New England Federalists to the Louisiana Purchase was\nprimarily economic self-interest, not any legitimate concern over\nconstitutionality or whether France indeed owned Louisiana or was required to\nsell it back to Spain should it desire to dispose of the territory. The\nNortherners were not enthusiastic about Western farmers gaining another outlet\nfor their crops that did not require the use of New England ports. Also, many\nFederalists were speculators in lands in upstate New York and New England and\nwere hoping to sell these lands to farmers, who might go west instead, if the\nLouisiana Purchase went through. They also feared that this would lead to\nWestern states being formed, which would likely be Republican, and dilute the\npolitical power of New England Federalists.[32][34]\n\nWhen Spain later objected to the United States purchasing Louisiana from\nFrance, Madison responded that America had first approached Spain about\npurchasing the property, but had been told by Spain itself that America would\nhave to treat with France for the territory.[35]\n\n## Treaty signing\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Louisiana_Purchase_1953_Issue-3c.jpg/220px-\nLouisiana_Purchase_1953_Issue-3c.jpg)](/wiki/File:Louisiana_Purchase_1953_Issue-3c.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Louisiana_Purchase_1953_Issue-3c.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIssue of 1953, commemorating the 150th Anniversary of signing\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase Treaty was signed on 30 April by [Robert\nLivingston](/wiki/Robert_R._Livingston_\\(chancellor\\) \"Robert R.

Jefferson announced the treaty to the American people on\nJuly 4. After the signing of the Louisiana Purchase agreement in 1803,\nLivingston made this famous statement, \"We have lived long, but this is the\nnoblest work of our whole lives... From this day the United States take their\nplace among the powers of the first rank.\"[36]\n\nThe [United States Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\")\nadvised and consented to ratification of the treaty with a vote of twenty-four\nto seven on October 20. The Senators who voted against the treaty were:\n[Simeon Olcott](/wiki/Simeon_Olcott \"Simeon Olcott\") and [William\nPlumer](/wiki/William_Plumer \"William Plumer\") of New Hampshire, [William\nWells](/wiki/William_H._Wells \"William H.

In legislation enacted on October 31, Congress made temporary\nprovisions for local civil government to continue as it had under French and\nSpanish rule and authorized the President to use military forces to maintain\norder. Plans were also set forth for several missions to explore and chart the\nterritory, the most famous being the [Lewis and Clark\nExpedition](/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition \"Lewis and Clark\nExpedition\").[37]\n\nA timeline of legislation can be found at the Library of Congress: American\nMemory:The Louisiana Purchase Legislative Timeline--1803-1804.[38]\n\n## Formal transfers and initial organization\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Louisiana_Purchase_New_Orleans_Thure_de_Thulstrup.jpg/220px-\nLouisiana_Purchase_New_Orleans_Thure_de_Thulstrup.jpg)](/wiki/File:Louisiana_Purchase_New_Orleans_Thure_de_Thulstrup.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Louisiana_Purchase_New_Orleans_Thure_de_Thulstrup.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFlag raising in the [Place d'Armes](/wiki/Jackson_Square_\\(New_Orleans\\)\n\"Jackson Square \\(New Orleans\\)\") of [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New\nOrleans\"), marking the transfer of sovereignty over French Louisiana to the\nUnited States, December 20, 1803, as depicted by [Thure de\nThulstrup](/wiki/Thure_de_Thulstrup \"Thure de Thulstrup\")\n\n[France](/wiki/French_First_Republic \"French First Republic\") turned over [New\nOrleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New Orleans\"), the historic colonial\n[capital](/wiki/Capital_city \"Capital city\"), on December 20, 1803, at [the\nCabildo](/wiki/The_Cabildo \"The Cabildo\"), with a [flag-\nraising](/wiki/Flag#Hoisting_the_flag \"Flag\") ceremony in the Plaza de Armas,\nnow [Jackson Square](/wiki/Jackson_Square_\\(New_Orleans\\) \"Jackson Square\n\\(New Orleans\\)\"). Just three weeks earlier, on November 30, 1803, Spanish\nofficials had formally conveyed the colonial lands and their administration to\nFrance.\n\nOn March 9 and 10, 1804, another ceremony, commemorated as [Three Flags\nDay](/wiki/Three_Flags_Day \"Three Flags Day\"), was conducted in [St.\nLouis](/wiki/St._Louis \"St. Louis\"), to transfer ownership of [Upper\nLouisiana](/wiki/Illinois_Country \"Illinois Country\") from\n[Spain](/wiki/New_Spain \"New Spain\") to the [French First\nRepublic](/wiki/French_First_Republic \"French First Republic\"), and then from\nFrance to the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"). From March\n10 to September 30, 1804, Upper Louisiana was supervised as a military\ndistrict, under [Commandant](/wiki/Commandant \"Commandant\") [Amos\nStoddard](/wiki/Amos_Stoddard \"Amos Stoddard\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nEffective October 1, 1804, the purchased territory was\n[organized](/wiki/Organized_territory \"Organized territory\") into the\n[Territory of Orleans](/wiki/Territory_of_Orleans \"Territory of Orleans\")\n(most of which would become the [state](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S. state\") of\nLouisiana) and the [District of Louisiana](/wiki/District_of_Louisiana\n\"District of Louisiana\"), which was temporarily under control of the governor\nand judicial system of the [Indiana Territory](/wiki/Indiana_Territory\n\"Indiana Territory\"). The following year, the District of Louisiana was\nrenamed the [Territory of Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana_Territory \"Louisiana\nTerritory\"), aka Louisiana Territory (1805–1812).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nNew Orleans was the administrative capital of the Orleans Territory, and St.\nLouis was the capital of the Louisiana Territory.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Boundaries\n\nA dispute soon arose between Spain and the United States regarding the extent\nof Louisiana. The territory's boundaries had not been defined in the 1762\n[Treaty of Fontainebleau](/wiki/Treaty_of_Fontainebleau_\\(1762\\) \"Treaty of\nFontainebleau \\(1762\\)\") that ceded it from France to Spain, nor in the 1801\nThird Treaty of San Ildefonso ceding it back to France, nor the 1803 Louisiana\nPurchase agreement ceding it to the United States.[39]\n\nThe United States claimed Louisiana included the entire western portion of the\nMississippi River drainage basin to the crest of the Rocky Mountains and land\nextending southeast to the [Rio Grande](/wiki/Rio_Grande \"Rio Grande\") and\n[West Florida](/wiki/West_Florida \"West Florida\").[40] Spain insisted that\nLouisiana comprised no more than the western bank of the Mississippi River and\nthe cities of New Orleans and St. Louis.[41] The dispute was ultimately\nresolved by the [Adams–Onís Treaty](/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty\n\"Adams–Onís Treaty\") of 1819, with the United States gaining most of what it\nhad claimed in the west.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/UnitedStatesExpansion.png/350px-\nUnitedStatesExpansion.png)](/wiki/File:UnitedStatesExpansion.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:UnitedStatesExpansion.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Purchase was one of several territorial additions to the U.S.\n\nThe relatively narrow [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana_\\(New_Spain\\) \"Louisiana\n\\(New Spain\\)\") of [New Spain](/wiki/New_Spain \"New Spain\") had been a special\nprovince under the jurisdiction of the [Captaincy General of\nCuba](/wiki/Captaincy_General_of_Cuba \"Captaincy General of Cuba\") while the\nvast region to the west was in 1803 still considered part of the Commandancy\nGeneral of the [Provincias Internas](/wiki/Provincias_Internas \"Provincias\nInternas\"). Louisiana had never been considered one of New Spain's internal\nprovinces.[42]\n\nIf the territory included all the tributaries of the Mississippi on its\nwestern bank, the northern reaches of the Purchase extended into the equally\nill-defined British possession—[Rupert's Land](/wiki/Rupert%27s_Land \"Rupert's\nLand\") of [British North America](/wiki/British_North_America \"British North\nAmerica\"), now part of Canada. The Purchase originally extended just beyond\nthe [50th parallel](/wiki/50th_parallel_north \"50th parallel north\"). However,\nthe territory north of the [49th parallel](/wiki/49th_parallel_north \"49th\nparallel north\") (including the [Milk\nRiver](/wiki/Milk_River_\\(Alberta%E2%80%93Montana\\) \"Milk River\n\\(Alberta–Montana\\)\") and [Poplar\nRiver](/wiki/Poplar_River_\\(Montana%E2%80%93Saskatchewan\\) \"Poplar River\n\\(Montana–Saskatchewan\\)\") watersheds) was ceded to the UK in exchange for\nparts of the [Red River Basin](/wiki/Red_River_Basin \"Red River Basin\") south\nof [49th parallel](/wiki/49th_parallel_north \"49th parallel north\") in the\n[Anglo-American Convention of 1818](/wiki/Treaty_of_1818 \"Treaty of\n1818\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nThe eastern boundary of the Louisiana purchase was the Mississippi River, from\nits source to the [31st parallel](/wiki/31st_parallel_north \"31st parallel\nnorth\"), though [the source of the Mississippi](/wiki/Lake_Itasca \"Lake\nItasca\") was, at the time, unknown. The eastern boundary below the 31st\nparallel was unclear. The U.S. claimed the land as far as the [Perdido\nRiver](/wiki/Perdido_River \"Perdido River\"), and Spain claimed that the border\nof its Florida Colony remained the [Mississippi River](/wiki/Mississippi_River\n\"Mississippi River\"). In early 1804, Congress passed the Mobile Act, which\nrecognized [West Florida](/wiki/West_Florida \"West Florida\") as part of the\nUnited States. The Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain (1819) resolved the issue upon\nratification in 1821. Today, the 31st parallel is the northern boundary of the\nwestern half of the [Florida Panhandle](/wiki/Florida_Panhandle \"Florida\nPanhandle\"), and the Perdido is the western boundary of Florida.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nBecause the western boundary was contested at the time of the Purchase,\nPresident Jefferson immediately began to organize three missions to explore\nand map the new territory. All three started from the Mississippi River. The\n[Lewis and Clark Expedition](/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition \"Lewis and Clark\nExpedition\") (1804) traveled up the [Missouri River](/wiki/Missouri_River\n\"Missouri River\"); the [Red River Expedition\n(1806)](/wiki/Red_River_Expedition_\\(1806\\) \"Red River Expedition \\(1806\\)\")\nexplored the Red River basin; the [Pike Expedition](/wiki/Pike_Expedition\n\"Pike Expedition\") (1806) also started up the Missouri, but turned south to\nexplore the [Arkansas River](/wiki/Arkansas_River \"Arkansas River\") watershed.\nThe maps and journals of the explorers helped to define the boundaries during\nthe negotiations leading to the Adams–Onís Treaty, which set the western\nboundary as follows: north up the [Sabine\nRiver](/wiki/Sabine_River_\\(Texas%E2%80%93Louisiana\\) \"Sabine River\n\\(Texas–Louisiana\\)\") from the [Gulf of Mexico](/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico \"Gulf of\nMexico\") to its intersection with the [32nd\nparallel](/wiki/32nd_parallel_north \"32nd parallel north\"), due north to the\n[Red River](/wiki/Red_River_of_the_South \"Red River of the South\"), up the Red\nRiver to the [100th meridian](/wiki/100th_meridian_west \"100th meridian\nwest\"), north to the [Arkansas River](/wiki/Arkansas_River \"Arkansas River\"),\nup the Arkansas River to its headwaters, due north to the [42nd\nparallel](/wiki/42nd_parallel_north \"42nd parallel north\") and due west to its\nprevious boundary.\n\n## Slavery\n\nSee also: [History of slavery in\nLouisiana](/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_Louisiana \"History of slavery in\nLouisiana\"), [History of slavery in\nMissouri](/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_Missouri \"History of slavery in\nMissouri\"), and [Slavery in the United\nStates](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States \"Slavery in the United States\")\n\nGoverning the Louisiana Territory was more difficult than acquiring it. Its\nEuropean peoples, of ethnic French, Spanish and Mexican descent, were largely\n[Catholic](/wiki/Catholic_Church \"Catholic Church\"); in addition, there was a\nlarge population of [enslaved Africans](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States\n\"Slavery in the United States\") made up of a high proportion of recent\narrivals, as [Spain](/wiki/Louisiana_\\(New_Spain\\) \"Louisiana \\(New Spain\\)\")\nhad continued the international [slave trade](/wiki/Slave_trade \"Slave\ntrade\"). This was particularly true in the area of the present-day state of\nLouisiana, which also contained a large number of [free people of\ncolor](/wiki/Free_people_of_color \"Free people of color\"). Both present-day\nArkansas and Missouri already had some [slaveholders](/wiki/Slaveholder\n\"Slaveholder\") in the early 19th century.\n\nDuring this period, south Louisiana received an influx of French-speaking\nrefugee [planters](/wiki/Planter_\\(American_South\\) \"Planter \\(American\nSouth\\)\"), who were permitted to bring their slaves with them, and other\nrefugees fleeing the large [slave revolt](/wiki/Haitian_Revolution \"Haitian\nRevolution\") in [Saint-Domingue](/wiki/Saint-Domingue \"Saint-Domingue\"),\ntoday's [Haiti](/wiki/Haiti \"Haiti\"). Many Southern slaveholders feared that\nacquisition of the new territory might inspire American-held slaves to follow\nthe example of those in Saint-Domingue and revolt. They wanted the US\ngovernment to establish laws allowing slavery in the newly acquired territory\nso they could be supported in taking their slaves there to undertake new\nagricultural enterprises, as well as to reduce the threat of future [slave\nrebellions](/wiki/Slave_rebellion \"Slave rebellion\").[43]\n\nThe Louisiana Territory was broken into smaller portions for administration,\nand the territories passed slavery laws similar to those in the southern\nstates but incorporating provisions from the preceding French and Spanish rule\n(for instance, Spain had prohibited slavery of Native Americans in 1769, but\nsome slaves of mixed [African](/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Africa \"Ethnic groups of\nAfrica\")-[Native American](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native\nAmericans in the United States\") descent were still being held in [St.\nLouis](/wiki/St._Louis \"St. Louis\") in [Upper\nLouisiana](/wiki/Illinois_Country \"Illinois Country\") when the U.S. took\nover).[44] In a [freedom suit](/wiki/Freedom_suit \"Freedom suit\") that went\nfrom Missouri to the [US Supreme Court](/wiki/US_Supreme_Court \"US Supreme\nCourt\"), slavery of Native Americans was finally ended in 1836.[44] The\ninstitutionalization of slavery under U.S. law in the Louisiana Territory\ncontributed to the [American Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American\nCivil War\") a half century later.[43] As states organized within the\nterritory, the status of slavery in each state became a matter of contention\nin Congress, as southern states wanted slavery extended to the west, and\nnorthern states just as strongly opposed new states being admitted as \"[slave\nstates](/wiki/Free_and_slave_states \"Free and slave states\").\"\n\nThe [Missouri Compromise](/wiki/Missouri_Compromise \"Missouri Compromise\") of\n1820 was a temporary solution.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Asserting U.S. possession\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Fort_Madison_1810.jpg/170px-\nFort_Madison_1810.jpg)](/wiki/File:Fort_Madison_1810.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Fort_Madison_1810.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPlan of [Fort Madison](/wiki/Fort_Madison \"Fort Madison\"), built in 1808 to\nestablish U.S. control over the northern part of the Louisiana Purchase, drawn\n1810\n\nAfter the early explorations, the U.S. government sought to establish control\nof the region, since trade along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers was still\ndominated by British and French traders from Canada and allied\n[Indians](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native Americans in the\nUnited States\"), especially the [Sauk](/wiki/Sauk_people \"Sauk people\") and\n[Fox](/wiki/Fox_\\(tribe\\) \"Fox \\(tribe\\)\"). The U.S. adapted the former\nSpanish facility at [Fort Bellefontaine](/wiki/Fort_Bellefontaine \"Fort\nBellefontaine\") as a fur trading post near St. Louis in 1804 for business with\nthe Sauk and Fox.[45] In 1808 two military forts with trading factories were\nbuilt, [Fort Osage](/wiki/Fort_Osage \"Fort Osage\") along the [Missouri\nRiver](/wiki/Missouri_River \"Missouri River\") in western present-day Missouri\nand [Fort Madison](/wiki/Fort_Madison \"Fort Madison\") along the [Upper\nMississippi River](/wiki/Upper_Mississippi_River \"Upper Mississippi River\") in\neastern present-day Iowa.[46] With tensions increasing with Great Britain, in\n1809 Fort Bellefontaine was converted to a U.S. military fort, and was used\nfor that purpose until 1826.\n\nDuring the [War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\"), Great Britain and\nallied Indians defeated U.S. forces in the Upper Mississippi; the U.S.\nabandoned Forts Osage and Madison, as well as several other U.S. forts built\nduring the war, including [Fort Johnson](/wiki/Fort_Johnson \"Fort Johnson\")\nand [Fort Shelby](/wiki/Fort_Shelby_\\(Wisconsin\\) \"Fort Shelby\n\\(Wisconsin\\)\"). After U.S. ownership of the region was confirmed in the\n[Treaty of Ghent](/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent \"Treaty of Ghent\") (1814), the U.S.\nbuilt or expanded forts along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, including\nadding to Fort Bellefontaine, and constructing [Fort\nArmstrong](/wiki/Fort_Armstrong,_Illinois \"Fort Armstrong, Illinois\") (1816)\nand [Fort Edwards](/wiki/Warsaw,_Illinois \"Warsaw, Illinois\") (1816) in\nIllinois, [Fort Crawford](/wiki/Fort_Crawford \"Fort Crawford\") (1816) in\n[Prairie du Chien](/wiki/Prairie_du_Chien \"Prairie du Chien\") Wisconsin, [Fort\nSnelling](/wiki/Fort_Snelling \"Fort Snelling\") (1819) in Minnesota, and [Fort\nAtkinson](/wiki/Fort_Atkinson_\\(Nebraska\\) \"Fort Atkinson \\(Nebraska\\)\")\n(1819) in Nebraska.[46]\n\n## Financing\n\nThe American government used $3 million in gold as a down payment, and issued\nbonds for the balance to pay France for the purchase. Earlier that year,\n[Francis Baring and Company](/wiki/Barings_Bank \"Barings Bank\") of London had\nbecome the U.S. government's official banking agent in London. Because of this\nfavored position, the U.S. asked the Baring firm to handle the transaction.\nFrancis Baring's son [Alexander](/wiki/Alexander_Baring,_1st_Baron_Ashburton\n\"Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton\") was in Paris at the time and helped\nin the negotiations.[47] Another Baring advantage was a close relationship\nwith [Hope and Company](/wiki/Hope_%26_Co. \"Hope & Co.\") of Amsterdam. The two\nbanking houses worked together to facilitate and underwrite the Purchase.\n\nBecause Napoleon wanted to receive his money as quickly as possible, the two\nfirms received the American bonds and shipped the gold to France.[47] Napoleon\nused the money to finance his [planned invasion of\nEngland](/wiki/Napoleon%27s_planned_invasion_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Napoleon's\nplanned invasion of the United Kingdom\"), which never took place.[48]\n\n## See also\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Flag_of_Louisiana.svg/32px-Flag_of_Louisiana.svg.png)[Louisiana portal](/wiki/Portal:Louisiana \"Portal:Louisiana\")\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/P_history.svg/31px-P_history.svg.png)[History portal](/wiki/Portal:History \"Portal:History\")\n\n  * [Alaska Purchase](/wiki/Alaska_Purchase \"Alaska Purchase\")\n  * [Florida Purchase](/wiki/Florida_Purchase \"Florida Purchase\")\n  * [Corps of Discovery](/wiki/Corps_of_Discovery \"Corps of Discovery\")\n  * [Franco-American alliance](/wiki/Franco-American_alliance \"Franco-American alliance\")\n  * [List of French possessions and colonies](/wiki/List_of_French_possessions_and_colonies \"List of French possessions and colonies\")\n    * [New France](/wiki/New_France \"New France\")\n  * [Historic regions of the United States](/wiki/Historic_regions_of_the_United_States \"Historic regions of the United States\")\n  * [Louisiana Purchase Historic State Park](/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase_State_Park \"Louisiana Purchase State Park\")\n  * [Territorial evolution of the United States](/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States \"Territorial evolution of the United States\")\n  * [Territories of the United States on stamps](/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States_on_stamps \"Territories of the United States on stamps\")\n\n## References\n\n### Footnotes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Congressional series of United States public documents\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=PHhHAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA5-PA56).
