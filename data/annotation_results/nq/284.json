The show\npremiered in 2002 on [Comedy Central](/wiki/Comedy_Central \"Comedy Central\")\nand returned to [MTV2](/wiki/MTV2 \"MTV2\") on February 9, 2007, running again\nuntil March 30, 2007.

Using\nthe basic premises, the performers improvise most of their lines, playing off\nof the responses of their marks, with the intention to keep them on the phone\nas long as possible.\n\nWith the exception of a few outside sources (including previous material from\nJim Florentine and the [Touch-Tone Terrorists](/wiki/Touch-Tone_Terrorists\n\"Touch-Tone Terrorists\")), all the calls are made from [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada\n\"Nevada\"). The [Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of\n1968](/wiki/Omnibus_Crime_Control_and_Safe_Streets_Act_of_1968 \"Omnibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968\") makes it illegal in most states to\nrecord telephone calls without both parties' consent. Under Nevada law, only\none of the parties has to give consent (i.e., the caller), so prank calls can\nbe recorded without the consent of the prank victims. One result of this was\nthe series' schedule of creating and airing new episodes was fairly sporadic\ndue to most of the celebrities living in Los Angeles, having Los Angeles-based\njobs, and so were only periodically able to go to Las Vegas to make calls.\nAdam Carolla, for example, took [his radio\nprogram](/wiki/The_Adam_Carolla_Show_\\(terrestrial_radio\\) \"The Adam Carolla\nShow \\(terrestrial radio\\)\") to Las Vegas once or twice a year, and while\nthere would record new calls for the program.\n\nThe puppets are then constructed based on the various marks' voices, and,\nalong with a series of stock characters (such as \"Niles Standish\", \"Bobby\nFletcher\", and \"Special Ed\") based on the performers' character voices, the\ncalls are re-enacted for the skits.\n\nThe main character puppets for the first season were constructed by Bob\nFlanagan's company [Den\nDesign](/w/index.php?title=Den_Design&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Den Design \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") with additional puppets built by BJ Guyer, Carol Binion,\nRick Lyon, Ron Binion, Jim Kroupa, and Artie Esposito. An in-house puppet shop\nwas set up for the following seasons to accommodate the fast-paced schedule of\nthe show and the sheer volume of puppet characters required for each episode.\n\nThe puppets are puppeteered by Ronald Binion, Rick Lyon, BJ Guyer, Victor\nYerrid, Paul McGinnis, Alice Dinean Vernon, and Artie Esposito.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOriginally, the show was titled _Prank Puppets_ ; it was renamed after Comedy\nCentral lawyers deemed that it implied [malice](/wiki/Malice_\\(law\\) \"Malice\n\\(law\\)\").[2]\n\n## Regular\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Crank_Yankers&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Regular characters\")]\n\n  * **Karl Malone** : Jimmy Kimmel's impression of then-[NBA](/wiki/NBA \"NBA\") star [Karl Malone](/wiki/Karl_Malone \"Karl Malone\").
