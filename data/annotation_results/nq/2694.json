There are two main\ntypes of atmospheric entry: uncontrolled entry, such as the entry of\n[astronomical objects](/wiki/Astronomical_object \"Astronomical object\"),\n[space debris](/wiki/Space_debris \"Space debris\") or [bolides](/wiki/Bolide\n\"Bolide\"); and controlled entry (or reentry) of a spacecraft capable of being\nnavigated or following a predetermined course. Technologies and procedures\nallowing the controlled atmospheric **e** ntry, **d** escent and **l** anding\nof spacecraft are collectively abbreviated as **EDL**.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Meteoroid_meteor_meteorite.gif/220px-\nMeteoroid_meteor_meteorite.gif)](/wiki/File:Meteoroid_meteor_meteorite.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Meteoroid_meteor_meteorite.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nAnimated illustration of different phases as a meteoroid enters the Earth's\natmosphere to become visible as a meteor and land as a meteorite\n\n[Atmospheric drag](/wiki/Drag_\\(physics\\) \"Drag \\(physics\\)\") and [aerodynamic\nheating](/wiki/Aerodynamic_heating \"Aerodynamic heating\") can cause\natmospheric breakup capable of completely disintegrating smaller objects.\nThese forces may cause objects with lower [compressive\nstrength](/wiki/Compressive_strength \"Compressive strength\") to explode.\n\nManned space vehicles must be slowed to subsonic speeds before parachutes or\nair brakes may be deployed. Such vehicles have kinetic energies typically\nbetween 50 and 1800 MJoules, and atmospheric dissipation is the only way of\nexpending the kinetic energy. The amount of rocket fuel required to slow the\nvehicle would be nearly equal to the amount used to accelerate it initially,\nand it is thus highly impractical to use retro rockets for the entire Earth\nre-entry procedure. While the high temperature generated at the surface of the\nheat shield is due to adiabatic compression, the vehicle's kinetic energy is\nultimately lost to gas friction (viscosity) after the vehicle has passed by.\nOther smaller energy losses include black body radiation directly from the hot\ngasses and chemical reactions between ionized gasses.\n\nBallistic warheads and expendable vehicles do not require slowing at re-entry,\nand in fact, are made streamlined so as to maintain their speed.\n\nFor [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\"), atmospheric entry occurs above the [Kármán\nline](/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line \"Kármán line\") at an\n[altitude](/wiki/Altitude \"Altitude\") of more than 100 km (62 mi.) above the\nsurface, while at [Venus atmospheric entry](/wiki/Venus#Atmospheric_entry\n\"Venus\") occurs at 250 km (155 mi.) and at [Mars atmospheric\nentry](/wiki/Mars_atmospheric_entry \"Mars atmospheric entry\") at about 80 km\n(50 mi.). Uncontrolled, objects accelerate through the atmosphere at extreme\nvelocities under the influence of Earth's [gravity](/wiki/Gravity \"Gravity\").\nMost controlled objects enter at [hypersonic](/wiki/Hypersonic \"Hypersonic\")\nspeeds due to their [suborbital](/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight \"Sub-orbital\nspaceflight\") (e.g., [intercontinental ballistic\nmissile](/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile \"Intercontinental ballistic\nmissile\") reentry vehicles), orbital (e.g., the [Space\nShuttle](/wiki/Space_Shuttle \"Space Shuttle\")), or\n[unbounded](/wiki/Hyperbolic_trajectory \"Hyperbolic trajectory\") (e.g.,\n[meteors](/wiki/Meteor \"Meteor\")) trajectories. Various advanced technologies\nhave been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme\nvelocities. An alternative low velocity method of controlled atmospheric entry\nis [buoyancy](/wiki/Buoyancy \"Buoyancy\")[1] which is suitable for planetary\nentry where thick atmospheres, strong gravity or both factors complicate high-\nvelocity hyperbolic entry, such as the atmospheres of [Venus](/wiki/Venus\n\"Venus\"), [Titan](/wiki/Titan_\\(moon\\) \"Titan \\(moon\\)\") and the [gas\ngiants](/wiki/Gas_giant \"Gas giant\").[2]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Terminology, definitions and jargon\n  * 3 Blunt body entry vehicles\n  * 4 Entry vehicle shapes\n    * 4.1 Sphere or spherical section\n    * 4.2 Sphere-cone\n    * 4.3 Biconic\n    * 4.4 Non-axisymmetric shapes\n  * 5 Shock layer gas physics\n    * 5.1 Perfect gas model\n    * 5.2 Real (equilibrium) gas model\n    * 5.3 Real (non-equilibrium) gas model\n    * 5.4 Frozen gas model\n  * 6 Thermal protection systems\n    * 6.1 Ablative\n      * 6.1.1 SLA-561V\n      * 6.1.2 Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator\n        * 6.1.2.1 PICA-X\n      * 6.1.3 SIRCA\n      * 6.1.4 AVCOAT\n    * 6.2 Thermal soak\n    * 6.3 Passively cooled\n    * 6.4 Actively cooled\n  * 7 Feathered reentry\n  * 8 Inflatable heat shield reentry\n    * 8.1 NASA IRVE\n    * 8.2 NASA HIAD\n  * 9 Entry vehicle design considerations\n  * 10 Notable atmospheric entry accidents\n  * 11 Uncontrolled and unprotected reentries\n    * 11.1 Deorbit disposal\n  * 12 Successful atmospheric re-entries from orbital velocities\n  * 13 Selected atmospheric re-entries\n  * 14 See also\n  * 15 Further reading\n  * 16 Notes and references\n  * 17 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Apollo_cm.jpg/220px-\nApollo_cm.jpg)](/wiki/File:Apollo_cm.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Apollo_cm.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nApollo Command Module flying at a high [angle of attack](/wiki/Angle_of_attack\n\"Angle of attack\") for lifting entry, artistic rendition.\n\nThe concept of the ablative [heat shield](/wiki/Heat_shield \"Heat shield\") was\ndescribed as early as 1920 by [Robert Goddard](/wiki/Robert_Goddard \"Robert\nGoddard\"): \"In the case of meteors, which enter the atmosphere with speeds as\nhigh as 30 miles per second (48 km/s), the interior of the meteors remains\ncold, and the erosion is due, to a large extent, to chipping or cracking of\nthe suddenly heated surface. For this reason, if the outer surface of the\napparatus were to consist of layers of a very infusible hard substance with\nlayers of a poor heat conductor between, the surface would not be eroded to\nany considerable extent, especially as the velocity of the apparatus would not\nbe nearly so great as that of the average meteor.\"[3]\n\nPractical development of reentry systems began as the range and reentry\nvelocity of [ballistic missiles](/wiki/Ballistic_missiles \"Ballistic\nmissiles\") increased. For early short-range missiles, like the\n[V-2](/wiki/V-2_rocket \"V-2 rocket\"), stabilization and aerodynamic stress\nwere important issues (many V-2s broke apart during reentry), but heating was\nnot a serious problem. Medium-range missiles like the Soviet\n[R-5](/wiki/R-5_Pobeda \"R-5 Pobeda\"), with a 1200 km range, required ceramic\ncomposite heat shielding on separable reentry vehicles (it was no longer\npossible for the entire rocket structure to survive re-entry). The first\n[ICBMs](/wiki/ICBM \"ICBM\"), with ranges of 8000 to 12,000 km, were only\npossible with the development of modern ablative heat shields and blunt-shaped\nvehicles. In the U.S., this technology was pioneered by [H. Julian\nAllen](/wiki/H._Julian_Allen \"H. Julian Allen\") at [Ames Research\nCenter](/wiki/Ames_Research_Center \"Ames Research Center\").[4]\n\n## Terminology, definitions and\njargon[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Terminology, definitions and jargon\")]\n\nOver the decades since the 1950s, a rich technical jargon has grown around the\nengineering of vehicles designed to enter planetary atmospheres. It is\nrecommended that the reader review the [jargon\nglossary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_atmospheric_reentry)\nbefore continuing with this article on atmospheric reentry.\n\nWhen atmospheric entry is part of a spacecraft landing or recovery,\nparticularly on a planetary body other than Earth, entry is part of a phase\nreferred to as \"entry, descent, and landing\", or EDL.[5] When the atmospheric\nentry returns to the same body that the vehicle had launched from, the event\nis referred to as **reentry** (almost always referring to Earth entry).\n\n## Blunt body entry\nvehicles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Blunt body entry vehicles\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Blunt_body_reentry_shapes.png/220px-\nBlunt_body_reentry_shapes.png)](/wiki/File:Blunt_body_reentry_shapes.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Blunt_body_reentry_shapes.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nVarious reentry shapes (NASA) using [shadowgraphs](/wiki/Schlieren_photography\n\"Schlieren photography\") to show high-velocity flow\n\nThese four [shadowgraph](/wiki/Schlieren_photography \"Schlieren photography\")\nimages represent early reentry-vehicle concepts. A shadowgraph is a process\nthat makes visible the disturbances that occur in a fluid flow at high\nvelocity, in which light passing through a flowing fluid is refracted by the\n[density gradients](/wiki/Density_Gradient \"Density Gradient\") in the fluid\nresulting in bright and dark areas on a screen placed behind the fluid.\n\nIn the United States, [H. Julian Allen](/wiki/H._Julian_Allen \"H. Julian\nAllen\") and [A. J. Eggers, Jr.](/wiki/Alfred_J._Eggers \"Alfred J. Eggers\") of\nthe [National Advisory Committee for\nAeronautics](/wiki/National_Advisory_Committee_for_Aeronautics \"National\nAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics\") (NACA) made the counterintuitive\ndiscovery in 1951[6] that a blunt shape (high drag) made the most effective\nheat shield. From simple engineering principles, Allen and Eggers showed that\nthe heat load experienced by an entry vehicle was inversely proportional to\nthe [drag coefficient](/wiki/Drag_coefficient \"Drag coefficient\"), i.e. the\ngreater the drag, the less the heat load. If the reentry vehicle is made\nblunt, air cannot \"get out of the way\" quickly enough, and acts as an air\ncushion to push the shock wave and heated shock layer forward (away from the\nvehicle). Since most of the hot gases are no longer in direct contact with the\nvehicle, the heat energy would stay in the shocked gas and simply move around\nthe vehicle to later dissipate into the atmosphere.\n\nThe Allen and Eggers discovery, though initially treated as a military secret,\nwas eventually published in 1958.[7]\n\n## Entry vehicle\nshapes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Entry vehicle shapes\")]\n\nMain article: [Nose cone design](/wiki/Nose_cone_design \"Nose cone design\")\n\nThere are several basic shapes used in designing entry vehicles:\n\n### Sphere or spherical\nsection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Sphere or spherical section\")]\n\nThe simplest axisymmetric shape is the sphere or spherical section.[8] This\ncan either be a complete sphere or a spherical section forebody with a\nconverging conical afterbody. The aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical\nsection are easy to model analytically using Newtonian impact theory.\nLikewise, the spherical section's heat flux can be accurately modeled with the\nFay-Riddell equation.[9] The static stability of a spherical section is\nassured if the vehicle's center of mass is upstream from the center of\ncurvature (dynamic stability is more problematic). Pure spheres have no lift.\nHowever, by flying at an [angle of attack](/wiki/Angle_of_attack \"Angle of\nattack\"), a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some\ncross-range capability and widening its entry corridor. In the late 1950s and\nearly 1960s, high-speed computers were not yet available and [computational\nfluid dynamics](/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics \"Computational fluid\ndynamics\") was still embryonic. Because the spherical section was amenable to\nclosed-form analysis, that geometry became the default for conservative\ndesign. Consequently, manned capsules of that era were based upon the\nspherical section.\n\nPure spherical entry vehicles were used in the early Soviet\n[Vostok](/wiki/Vostok_programme \"Vostok programme\") and\n[Voskhod](/wiki/Voskhod_programme \"Voskhod programme\") and in Soviet Mars and\n[Venera](/wiki/Venera \"Venera\") descent vehicles. The [Apollo Command/Service\nModule](/wiki/Apollo_Command/Service_Module \"Apollo Command/Service Module\")\nused a spherical section forebody heat shield with a converging conical\nafterbody. It flew a lifting entry with a hypersonic trim angle of attack of\n−27° (0° is blunt-end first) to yield an average L/D (lift-to-drag ratio) of\n0.368.[10] This angle of attack was achieved by precisely offsetting the\nvehicle's center of mass from its axis of symmetry. Other examples of the\nspherical section geometry in manned capsules are\n[Soyuz](/wiki/Soyuz_programme \"Soyuz programme\")/[Zond](/wiki/Zond_program\n\"Zond program\"), [Gemini](/wiki/Project_Gemini \"Project Gemini\") and\n[Mercury](/wiki/Project_Mercury \"Project Mercury\"). Even these small amounts\nof lift allow trajectories that have very significant effects on peak g-force\n(reducing g-force from 8-9g for a purely ballistic (slowed only by drag)\ntrajectory to 4-5g) as well as greatly reducing the peak reentry heat.[11]\n\n### Sphere-\ncone[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Sphere-cone\")]\n\nThe sphere-cone is a spherical section with a [frustum](/wiki/Frustum\n\"Frustum\") or blunted cone attached. The sphere-cone's dynamic stability is\ntypically better than that of a spherical section. The vehicle enters sphere-\nfirst. With a sufficiently small half-angle and properly placed center of\nmass, a sphere-cone can provide aerodynamic stability from Keplerian entry to\nsurface impact. (The \"half-angle\" is the angle between the cone's axis of\nrotational symmetry and its outer surface, and thus half the angle made by the\ncone's surface edges.)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Mk_2.jpg/220px-\nMk_2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mk_2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mk_2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPrototype of the Mk-2 Reentry Vehicle (RV), based on blunt body theory\n\nThe original American sphere-cone aeroshell was the Mk-2 RV (reentry vehicle),\nwhich was developed in 1955 by the [General Electric\nCorp.](/wiki/General_Electric \"General Electric\") The Mk-2's design was\nderived from blunt-body theory and used a radiatively cooled thermal\nprotection system (TPS) based upon a metallic heat shield (the different TPS\ntypes are later described in this article). The Mk-2 had significant defects\nas a weapon delivery system, i.e., it loitered too long in the upper\natmosphere due to its lower [ballistic\ncoefficient](/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient \"Ballistic coefficient\") and also\ntrailed a stream of vaporized metal making it very visible to\n[radar](/wiki/Radar \"Radar\"). These defects made the Mk-2 overly susceptible\nto anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems. Consequently, an alternative sphere-\ncone RV to the Mk-2 was developed by General Electric.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Mk_6_reentry_vehicle_on_display_at_National_Atomic_Museum.jpg/170px-\nMk_6_reentry_vehicle_on_display_at_National_Atomic_Museum.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mk_6_reentry_vehicle_on_display_at_National_Atomic_Museum.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mk_6_reentry_vehicle_on_display_at_National_Atomic_Museum.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nMk-6 RV, Cold War weapon and ancestor to most of the U.S. missile entry\nvehicles\n\nThis new RV was the Mk-6 which used a non-metallic ablative TPS (nylon\nphenolic). This new TPS was so effective as a reentry heat shield that\nsignificantly reduced bluntness was possible.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nHowever, the Mk-6 was a huge RV with an entry mass of 3360 kg, a length of 3.1\nmeters and a half-angle of 12.5°. Subsequent advances in nuclear weapon and\nablative TPS design allowed RVs to become significantly smaller with a further\nreduced bluntness ratio compared to the Mk-6. Since the 1960s, the sphere-cone\nhas become the preferred geometry for modern ICBM RVs with typical half-angles\nbeing between 10° to 11°.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Rv_film_pod.jpg/170px-\nRv_film_pod.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rv_film_pod.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rv_film_pod.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Discoverer\" type reconnaissance satellite film Recovery Vehicle (RV)\n\n[Reconnaissance satellite](/wiki/Reconnaissance_satellite \"Reconnaissance\nsatellite\") RVs (recovery vehicles) also used a sphere-cone shape and were the\nfirst American example of a non-munition entry vehicle\n([Discoverer-I](/wiki/Corona_\\(satellite\\) \"Corona \\(satellite\\)\"), launched\non 28 February 1959). The sphere-cone was later used for space exploration\nmissions to other celestial bodies or for return from open space; e.g.,\n[Stardust probe](/wiki/Stardust_probe \"Stardust probe\"). Unlike with military\nRVs, the advantage of the blunt body's lower TPS mass remained with space\nexploration entry vehicles like the [Galileo Probe](/wiki/Galileo_Probe\n\"Galileo Probe\") with a half angle of 45° or the [Viking\naeroshell](/wiki/Viking_program \"Viking program\") with a half angle of 70°.\nSpace exploration sphere-cone entry vehicles have landed on the surface or\nentered the atmospheres of [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\"), [Venus](/wiki/Venus\n\"Venus\"), [Jupiter](/wiki/Jupiter \"Jupiter\") and [Titan](/wiki/Titan_\\(moon\\)\n\"Titan \\(moon\\)\").\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Galileo_probe.jpg/220px-\nGalileo_probe.jpg)](/wiki/File:Galileo_probe.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Galileo_probe.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Galileo Probe](/wiki/Galileo_Probe \"Galileo Probe\") during final assembly\n\n### Biconic[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Biconic\")]\n\nThe [biconic](/wiki/Biconic \"Biconic\") is a sphere-cone with an additional\nfrustum attached. The biconic offers a significantly improved L/D ratio. A\nbiconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately\n1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM. The higher L/D makes a\nbiconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower\npeak deceleration. Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the\n_Advanced[Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle](/wiki/Maneuverable_reentry_vehicle\n\"Maneuverable reentry vehicle\")_ (AMaRV). Four AMaRVs were made by the\n[McDonnell-Douglas Corp.](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas \"McDonnell Douglas\") and\nrepresented a significant leap in RV sophistication. Three AMaRVs were\nlaunched by [Minuteman-1 ICBMs](/wiki/LGM-30_Minuteman \"LGM-30 Minuteman\") on\n20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981. AMaRV had an entry mass\nof approximately 470 kg, a nose radius of 2.34 cm, a forward frustum half-\nangle of 10.4°, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6 cm, aft frustum half angle of\n6°, and an axial length of 2.079 meters. No accurate diagram or picture of\nAMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature. However, a schematic sketch of\nan AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has\nbeen published.[12]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Delta_Clipper_DC-\nX_first_flight.jpg/220px-Delta_Clipper_DC-\nX_first_flight.jpg)](/wiki/File:Delta_Clipper_DC-X_first_flight.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Delta_Clipper_DC-X_first_flight.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe DC-X, shown during its first flight, was a prototype [single stage to\norbit](/wiki/Single_stage_to_orbit \"Single stage to orbit\") vehicle, and used\na biconic shape similar to AMaRV.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Opportunity_Heat_Shield.jpg/300px-\nOpportunity_Heat_Shield.jpg)](/wiki/File:Opportunity_Heat_Shield.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Opportunity_Heat_Shield.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOpportunity rover's heat shield lying inverted on the surface of Mars.\n\nAMaRV's attitude was controlled through a split body flap (also called a\n\"split-windward flap\") along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicle's\nsides. [Hydraulic actuation](/wiki/Hydraulic_machinery \"Hydraulic machinery\")\nwas used for controlling the flaps. AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous\nnavigation system designed for evading [anti-ballistic missile](/wiki/Anti-\nballistic_missile \"Anti-ballistic missile\") (ABM) interception. The [McDonnell\nDouglas DC-X](/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X \"McDonnell Douglas DC-X\") (also a\nbiconic) was essentially a scaled-up version of AMaRV. AMaRV and the DC-X also\nserved as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became\nthe [Lockheed Martin X-33](/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_X-33 \"Lockheed Martin X-33\").\n\n### Non-axisymmetric\nshapes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Non-axisymmetric shapes\")]\n\nNon-axisymmetric shapes have been used for manned entry vehicles. One example\nis the winged orbit vehicle that uses a [delta wing](/wiki/Delta_wing \"Delta\nwing\") for maneuvering during descent much like a conventional glider. This\napproach has been used by the American [Space Shuttle](/wiki/Space_Shuttle\n\"Space Shuttle\") and the Soviet [Buran](/wiki/Shuttle_Buran \"Shuttle Buran\").\nThe [lifting body](/wiki/Lifting_body \"Lifting body\") is another entry vehicle\ngeometry and was used with the [X-23 PRIME](/wiki/X-23_PRIME \"X-23 PRIME\")\n(Precision Recovery Including Maneuvering Entry) vehicle.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe FIRST (Fabrication of Inflatable Re-entry Structures for Test) system was\nan [Aerojet](/wiki/Aerojet \"Aerojet\") proposal for an inflated-spar [Rogallo\nwing](/wiki/Rogallo_wing \"Rogallo wing\") made up from [Inconel](/wiki/Inconel\n\"Inconel\") wire cloth impregnated with silicone rubber and silicon carbide\ndust. FIRST was proposed in both one-man and six man versions, used for\nemergency escape and reentry of stranded space station crews, and was based on\nan earlier unmanned test program that resulted in a partially successful\nreentry flight from space (the launcher nose cone fairing hung up on the\nmaterial, dragging it too low and fast for the thermal protection system\n(TPS), but otherwise it appears the concept would have worked; even with the\nfairing dragging it, the test article flew stably on reentry until burn-\nthrough).[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe proposed [MOOSE](/wiki/MOOSE \"MOOSE\") system would have used a one-man\ninflatable ballistic capsule as an emergency astronaut entry vehicle. This\nconcept was carried further by the Douglas [Paracone](/wiki/Paracone\n\"Paracone\") project. While these concepts were unusual, the inflated shape on\nreentry was in fact axisymmetric.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Shock layer gas\nphysics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Shock layer gas physics\")]\n\nAt typical reentry temperatures, the air in the shock layer is both\n[ionized](/wiki/Ionized \"Ionized\") and\n[dissociated](/wiki/Dissociation_\\(chemistry\\) \"Dissociation\n\\(chemistry\\)\").[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] This chemical dissociation necessitates various\nphysical models to describe the shock layer's thermal and chemical properties.\nThere are four basic physical models of a gas that are important to\naeronautical engineers who design heat shields:\n\n### Perfect gas\nmodel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Perfect gas model\")]\n\nAlmost all aeronautical engineers are taught the [perfect (ideal) gas\nmodel](/wiki/Ideal_gas \"Ideal gas\") during their undergraduate education. Most\nof the important perfect gas equations along with their corresponding tables\nand graphs are shown in NACA Report 1135.[13] Excerpts from NACA Report 1135\noften appear in the appendices of thermodynamics textbooks and are familiar to\nmost aeronautical engineers who design supersonic aircraft.\n\nThe perfect gas theory is elegant and extremely useful for designing aircraft\nbut assumes that the gas is chemically inert. From the standpoint of aircraft\ndesign, air can be assumed to be inert for temperatures less than 550 K at one\natmosphere pressure. The perfect gas theory begins to break down at 550 K and\nis not usable at temperatures greater than 2,000 K. For temperatures greater\nthan 2,000 K, a heat shield designer must use a _real gas model_.\n\n### Real (equilibrium) gas\nmodel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Real \\(equilibrium\\) gas model\")]\n\nAn entry vehicle's pitching moment can be significantly influenced by real-gas\neffects. Both the Apollo-CM and the Space Shuttle were designed using\nincorrect pitching moments determined through inaccurate real-gas modelling.\nThe Apollo-CM's trim-angle angle of attack was higher than originally\nestimated, resulting in a narrower lunar return entry corridor. The actual\naerodynamic centre of the [_Columbia_](/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia \"Space\nShuttle Columbia\") was upstream from the calculated value due to real-gas\neffects. On _Columbia_ ’s maiden flight ([STS-1](/wiki/STS-1 \"STS-1\")),\nastronauts [John W. Young](/wiki/John_Young_\\(astronaut\\) \"John Young\n\\(astronaut\\)\") and [Robert Crippen](/wiki/Robert_Crippen \"Robert Crippen\")\nhad some anxious moments during reentry when there was concern about losing\ncontrol of the vehicle.[14]\n\nAn equilibrium real-gas model assumes that a gas is chemically reactive, but\nalso assumes all chemical reactions have had time to complete and all\ncomponents of the gas have the same temperature (this is called\n_[thermodynamic equilibrium](/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium \"Thermodynamic\nequilibrium\")_). When air is processed by a shock wave, it is superheated by\ncompression and chemically dissociates through many different reactions.\nDirect friction upon the reentry object is not the main cause of shock-layer\nheating. It is caused mainly from [isentropic](/wiki/Isentropic_process\n\"Isentropic process\") heating of the air molecules within the compression\nwave. Friction based entropy increases of the molecules within the wave also\naccount for some heating.[_[original\nresearch?](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research \"Wikipedia:No original\nresearch\")_] The distance from the shock wave to the [stagnation\npoint](/wiki/Stagnation_point \"Stagnation point\") on the entry vehicle's\nleading edge is called _shock wave stand off_. An approximate rule of thumb\nfor shock wave standoff distance is 0.14 times the nose radius. One can\nestimate the time of travel for a gas molecule from the shock wave to the\nstagnation point by assuming a free stream velocity of 7.8 km/s and a nose\nradius of 1 meter, i.e., time of travel is about 18 microseconds. This is\nroughly the time required for shock-wave-initiated chemical dissociation to\napproach [chemical equilibrium](/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium \"Chemical\nequilibrium\") in a shock layer for a 7.8 km/s entry into air during peak heat\nflux. Consequently, as air approaches the entry vehicle's stagnation point,\nthe air effectively reaches chemical equilibrium thus enabling an equilibrium\nmodel to be usable. For this case, most of the shock layer between the shock\nwave and leading edge of an entry vehicle is chemically reacting and _not_ in\na state of equilibrium. The [Fay-Riddell\nequation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_atmospheric_reentry#F\n\"wikt:Appendix:Glossary of atmospheric reentry\"),[9] which is of extreme\nimportance towards modeling heat flux, owes its validity to the stagnation\npoint being in chemical equilibrium. The time required for the shock layer gas\nto reach equilibrium is strongly dependent upon the shock layer's pressure.\nFor example, in the case of the [Galileo Probe](/wiki/Galileo_\\(spacecraft\\)\n\"Galileo \\(spacecraft\\)\")'s entry into Jupiter's atmosphere, the shock layer\nwas mostly in equilibrium during peak heat flux due to the very high pressures\nexperienced (this is counterintuitive given the free stream velocity was 39\nkm/s during peak heat flux).\n\nDetermining the thermodynamic state of the stagnation point is more difficult\nunder an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model. Under a perfect gas\nmodel, the _ratio of specific heats_ (also called \"isentropic exponent\",\n[adiabatic index](/wiki/Adiabatic_index \"Adiabatic index\"), \"gamma\" or\n\"kappa\") is assumed to be constant along with the [gas\nconstant](/wiki/Gas_constant \"Gas constant\"). For a real gas, the ratio of\nspecific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature. Under a\nperfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining\nthermodynamic state along a constant entropy stream line called the\n_isentropic chain_. For a real gas, the isentropic chain is unusable and a\n_Mollier diagram_ would be used instead for manual calculation. However,\ngraphical solution with a Mollier diagram is now considered obsolete with\nmodern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital\nlookup table (another form of Mollier diagram) or a chemistry based\nthermodynamics program. The chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with\nfixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the _Gibbs free\nenergy method_. [Gibbs free energy](/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy \"Gibbs free\nenergy\") is simply the total [enthalpy](/wiki/Enthalpy \"Enthalpy\") of the gas\nminus its total [entropy](/wiki/Entropy \"Entropy\") times temperature. A\nchemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or\nreaction-rate equations. The program works by preserving the original\nelemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular\ncombinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest\npossible Gibbs free energy is calculated (a [Newton-Raphson\nmethod](/wiki/Newton%27s_method \"Newton's method\") is the usual numerical\nscheme). The data base for a Gibbs free energy program comes from\nspectroscopic data used in defining [partition\nfunctions](/wiki/Partition_function_\\(statistical_mechanics\\) \"Partition\nfunction \\(statistical mechanics\\)\"). Among the best equilibrium codes in\nexistence is the program _Chemical Equilibrium with Applications_ (CEA) which\nwas written by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon at NASA Lewis (now renamed\n\"NASA Glenn Research Center\"). Other names for CEA are the \"Gordon and McBride\nCode\" and the \"Lewis Code\". CEA is quite accurate up to 10,000 K for planetary\natmospheric gases, but unusable beyond 20,000 K ([double\nionization](/wiki/Double_ionization \"Double ionization\") is not modelled).\n[CEA can be downloaded from the Internet](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/)\nalong with full documentation and will compile on Linux under the [G77\nFortran](/wiki/GNU_Fortran \"GNU Fortran\") compiler.\n\n### Real (non-equilibrium) gas\nmodel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Real \\(non-equilibrium\\) gas model\")]\n\nA non-equilibrium real gas model is the most accurate model of a shock layer's\ngas physics, but is more difficult to solve than an equilibrium model. The\nsimplest non-equilibrium model is the _Lighthill-Freeman model_.[15][16] The\nLighthill-Freeman model initially assumes a gas made up of a single diatomic\nspecies susceptible to only one chemical formula and its reverse; e.g., N2 → N\n+ N and N + N → N2 (dissociation and recombination). Because of its\nsimplicity, the Lighthill-Freeman model is a useful pedagogical tool, but is\nunfortunately too simple for modelling non-equilibrium air. Air is typically\nassumed to have a mole fraction composition of 0.7812 molecular nitrogen,\n0.2095 molecular oxygen and 0.0093 argon. The simplest real gas model for air\nis the _five species model_ , which is based upon N2, O2, NO, N, and O. The\nfive species model assumes no ionization and ignores trace species like carbon\ndioxide.\n\nWhen running a Gibbs free energy equilibrium program, the iterative process\nfrom the originally specified molecular composition to the final calculated\nequilibrium composition is essentially random and not time accurate. With a\nnon-equilibrium program, the computation process is time accurate and follows\na solution path dictated by chemical and reaction rate formulas. The five\nspecies model has 17 chemical formulas (34 when counting reverse formulas).\nThe Lighthill-Freeman model is based upon a single ordinary differential\nequation and one algebraic equation. The five species model is based upon 5\nordinary differential equations and 17 algebraic equations. Because the 5\nordinary differential equations are loosely coupled, the system is numerically\n\"stiff\" and difficult to solve. The five species model is only usable for\nentry from [low Earth orbit](/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit \"Low Earth orbit\") where\nentry velocity is approximately 7.8 km/s. For lunar return entry of 11 km/s,\nthe shock layer contains a significant amount of ionized nitrogen and oxygen.\nThe five species model is no longer accurate and a twelve species model must\nbe used instead. High speed Mars entry which involves a carbon dioxide,\nnitrogen and argon atmosphere is even more complex requiring a 19 species\nmodel.\n\nAn important aspect of modelling non-equilibrium real gas effects is radiative\nheat flux. If a vehicle is entering an atmosphere at very high speed\n(hyperbolic trajectory, lunar return) and has a large nose radius then\nradiative heat flux can dominate TPS heating. Radiative heat flux during entry\ninto an air or carbon dioxide atmosphere typically comes from asymmetric\ndiatomic molecules; e.g., [cyanogen](/wiki/Cyanogen \"Cyanogen\") (CN), [carbon\nmonoxide](/wiki/Carbon_monoxide \"Carbon monoxide\"), [nitric\noxide](/wiki/Nitric_oxide \"Nitric oxide\") (NO), single ionized molecular\nnitrogen etc. These molecules are formed by the shock wave dissociating\nambient atmospheric gas followed by recombination within the shock layer into\nnew molecular species. The newly formed [diatomic](/wiki/Diatomic \"Diatomic\")\nmolecules initially have a very high vibrational temperature that efficiently\ntransforms the [vibrational energy](/wiki/Quantum_vibration \"Quantum\nvibration\") into radiant energy; i.e., radiative heat flux. The whole process\ntakes place in less than a millisecond which makes modelling a challenge. The\nexperimental measurement of radiative heat flux (typically done with shock\ntubes) along with theoretical calculation through the unsteady [Schrödinger\nequation](/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation \"Schrödinger equation\") are among\nthe more esoteric aspects of aerospace engineering. Most of the aerospace\nresearch work related to understanding radiative heat flux was done in the\n1960s, but largely discontinued after conclusion of the Apollo Program.\nRadiative heat flux in air was just sufficiently understood to ensure Apollo's\nsuccess. However, radiative heat flux in carbon dioxide (Mars entry) is still\nbarely understood and will require major research.\n\n### Frozen gas\nmodel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Frozen gas model\")]\n\nThe frozen gas model describes a special case of a gas that is not in\nequilibrium. The name \"frozen gas\" can be misleading. A frozen gas is not\n\"frozen\" like ice is frozen water. Rather a frozen gas is \"frozen\" in time\n(all chemical reactions are assumed to have stopped). Chemical reactions are\nnormally driven by collisions between molecules. If gas pressure is slowly\nreduced such that chemical reactions can continue then the gas can remain in\nequilibrium. However, it is possible for gas pressure to be so suddenly\nreduced that almost all chemical reactions stop. For that situation the gas is\nconsidered frozen.\n\nThe distinction between equilibrium and frozen is important because it is\npossible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties\n(speed-of-sound, [viscosity](/wiki/Viscosity \"Viscosity\") etc.) for the same\nthermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature. Frozen gas can be a\nsignificant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle. During reentry, free\nstream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry\nvehicle's shock wave. Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then\ntransported past the entry vehicle's leading side into a region of rapidly\nexpanding flow that causes freezing. The frozen air can then be entrained into\na trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle. Correctly modelling the flow in\nthe wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult. [Thermal protection\nshield](/wiki/Space_Shuttle_thermal_protection_system \"Space Shuttle thermal\nprotection system\") (TPS) heating in the vehicle's afterbody is usually not\nvery high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle's wake can\nsignificantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly\ndynamic stability.\n\n## Thermal protection\nsystems[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Thermal protection systems\")]\n\nA **thermal protection system** or TPS is the barrier that protects a\n[spacecraft](/wiki/Spacecraft \"Spacecraft\") during the searing heat of\natmospheric reentry. A secondary goal may be to protect the spacecraft from\nthe [heat](/wiki/Solar_constant \"Solar constant\")\n[and](/wiki/Radiative_heat_transfer \"Radiative heat transfer\")\n[cold](/wiki/Outer_space#Environment \"Outer space\") of space while in orbit.\nMultiple approaches for the thermal protection of spacecraft are in use, among\nthem ablative heat shields, passive cooling and active cooling of spacecraft\nsurfaces.\n\n###\nAblative[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Ablative\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Apollo_12_heat_shield.JPG/220px-\nApollo_12_heat_shield.JPG)](/wiki/File:Apollo_12_heat_shield.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Apollo_12_heat_shield.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nAblative heat shield (after use) on [Apollo 12](/wiki/Apollo_12 \"Apollo 12\")\ncapsule\n\nThe [ablative](/wiki/Ablation \"Ablation\") heat shield functions by lifting the\nhot shock layer gas away from the heat shield's outer wall (creating a cooler\n[boundary layer](/wiki/Boundary_layer \"Boundary layer\")). The boundary layer\ncomes from _blowing_ of gaseous reaction products from the heat shield\nmaterial and provides protection against all forms of heat flux. The overall\nprocess of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield's outer wall\nby way of a boundary layer is called _blockage_. Ablation occurs at two levels\nin an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and\n[sublimes](/wiki/Sublimation_\\(physics\\) \"Sublimation \\(physics\\)\"), while the\nbulk of the TPS material undergoes [pyrolysis](/wiki/Pyrolysis \"Pyrolysis\")\nand expels product gases. The gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing\nand causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux.\n[Pyrolysis](/wiki/Pyrolysis \"Pyrolysis\") can be measured in real time using\n[thermogravimetric analysis](/wiki/Thermogravimetric_analysis\n\"Thermogravimetric analysis\"), so that the ablative performance can be\nevaluated.[17] Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux\nby introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque.\nRadiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of\nthe Galileo Probe TPS material (carbon phenolic). Carbon phenolic was\noriginally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material (used in the [Space\nShuttle Solid Rocket Booster](/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster \"Space\nShuttle Solid Rocket Booster\")) and for re-entry vehicle nose tips.\n\nEarly research on ablation technology in the USA was centered at\n[NASA](/wiki/NASA \"NASA\")'s [Ames Research Center](/wiki/Ames_Research_Center\n\"Ames Research Center\") located at [Moffett Field](/wiki/Moffett_Field\n\"Moffett Field\"), California. [Ames Research\nCenter](/wiki/Ames_Research_Center \"Ames Research Center\") was ideal, since it\nhad numerous [wind tunnels](/wiki/Wind_tunnels \"Wind tunnels\") capable of\ngenerating varying wind velocities. Initial experiments typically mounted a\nmock-up of the ablative material to be analyzed within a\n[hypersonic](/wiki/Hypersonic \"Hypersonic\") wind tunnel.[18] Testing of\nablative materials occurs at the Ames Arc Jet Complex. Many spacecraft thermal\nprotection systems have been tested in this facility, including the Apollo,\nspace shuttle, and Orion heat shield materials.[19]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Mars_Pathfinder.jpg/170px-\nMars_Pathfinder.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mars_Pathfinder.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mars_Pathfinder.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMars Pathfinder during final assembly showing the aeroshell, cruise ring and\nsolid rocket motor\n\nThe [thermal conductivity](/wiki/Thermal_conductivity \"Thermal conductivity\")\nof a particular TPS material is usually proportional to the material's\ndensity.[20] Carbon phenolic is a very effective ablative material, but also\nhas high density which is undesirable. If the heat flux experienced by an\nentry vehicle is insufficient to cause pyrolysis then the TPS material's\nconductivity could allow heat flux conduction into the TPS bondline material\nthus leading to TPS failure. Consequently, for entry trajectories causing\nlower heat flux, carbon phenolic is sometimes inappropriate and lower density\nTPS materials such as the following examples can be better design choices:\n\n####\nSLA-561V[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: SLA-561V\")]\n\n_SLA_ in _SLA-561V_ stands for _super light-weight ablator_. SLA-561V is a\nproprietary ablative made by [Lockheed Martin](/wiki/Lockheed_Martin \"Lockheed\nMartin\") that has been used as the primary TPS material on all of the 70°\nsphere-cone entry vehicles sent by NASA to Mars other than the [Mars Science\nLaboratory](/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory \"Mars Science Laboratory\") (MSL).\nSLA-561V begins significant ablation at a heat flux of approximately 110\nW/cm², but will fail for heat fluxes greater than 300 W/cm². The MSL aeroshell\nTPS is currently designed to withstand a peak heat flux of 234 W/cm². The peak\nheat flux experienced by the [Viking-1](/wiki/Viking_1 \"Viking 1\") aeroshell\nwhich landed on Mars was 21 W/cm². For Viking-1, the TPS acted as a charred\nthermal insulator and never experienced significant ablation. Viking-1 was the\nfirst Mars lander and based upon a very conservative design. The Viking\naeroshell had a base diameter of 3.54 meters (the largest used on Mars until\nMars Science Laboratory). SLA-561V is applied by packing the ablative material\ninto a honeycomb core that is pre-bonded to the aeroshell's structure thus\nenabling construction of a large heat shield.[21]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Stardust_Capsule_on_Ground.jpg/170px-\nStardust_Capsule_on_Ground.jpg)](/wiki/File:Stardust_Capsule_on_Ground.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Stardust_Capsule_on_Ground.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNASA's Stardust sample return capsule successfully landed at the USAF Utah\nRange.\n\n#### Phenolic impregnated carbon\nablator[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator\")]\n\n_Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator_ (PICA), a [carbon\nfiber](/wiki/Carbon_fiber \"Carbon fiber\") preform impregnated in [phenolic\nresin](/wiki/Phenolic_resin \"Phenolic resin\"),[22] is a modern TPS material\nand has the advantages of low density (much lighter than carbon phenolic)\ncoupled with efficient ablative ability at high heat flux. It is a good choice\nfor ablative applications such as high-peak-heating conditions found on\nsample-return missions or lunar-return missions.

This was faster than the Apollo mission capsules and 70% faster\nthan the Shuttle.[24] PICA was critical for the viability of the Stardust\nmission, which returned to Earth in 2006. Stardust's heat shield (0.81 m base\ndiameter) was made of one monolithic piece sized to withstand a nominal peak\nheating rate of 1.2 kW/cm2.

SHARP TPS have suggested\nperformance improvements allowing for sustained Mach 7 flight at sea level,\nMach 11 flight at 100,000 ft (30,000 m) altitudes, and significant\nimprovements for vehicles designed for continuous hypersonic flight. SHARP TPS\nmaterials enable sharp leading edges and nose cones to greatly reduce drag for\nairbreathing combined-cycle-propelled spaceplanes and lifting bodies. SHARP\nmaterials have exhibited effective TPS characteristics from zero to more than\n2,000 °C, with melting points over 3,500 °C. They are structurally stronger\nthan RCC, and, thus, do not require structural reinforcement with materials\nsuch as Inconel. SHARP materials are extremely efficient at reradiating\nabsorbed heat, thus eliminating the need for additional TPS behind and between\nthe SHARP materials and conventional vehicle structure. NASA initially funded\n(and discontinued) a multi-phase R&D program through the [University of\nMontana](/wiki/University_of_Montana \"University of Montana\") in 2001 to test\nSHARP materials on test vehicles.[37][38]\n\n### Actively\ncooled[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Actively cooled\")]\n\nVarious advanced reusable spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft designs have been\nproposed to employ heat shields made from temperature-resistant metal\n[alloys](/wiki/Alloy \"Alloy\") that incorporated a refrigerant or cryogenic\nfuel circulating through them. Such a TPS concept was proposed for the [X-30\nNational Aerospace Plane](/wiki/Rockwell_X-30 \"Rockwell X-30\") (NASP). The\nNASP was supposed to have been a [scramjet](/wiki/Scramjet \"Scramjet\") powered\nhypersonic aircraft, but failed in development.\n\nIn the early 1960s various TPS systems were proposed to use water or other\ncooling liquid sprayed into the shock layer, or passed through channels in the\nheat shield. Advantages included the possibility of more all-metal designs\nwhich would be cheaper to develop, be more rugged, and eliminate the need for\nclassified technology. The disadvantages are increased weight and complexity,\nand lower reliability. The concept has never been flown, but a similar\ntechnology (the plug nozzle[39]) did undergo extensive ground testing.\n\n## Feathered\nreentry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Feathered reentry\")]\n\nIn 2004, aircraft designer [Burt Rutan](/wiki/Burt_Rutan \"Burt Rutan\")\ndemonstrated the feasibility of a shape-changing airfoil for reentry with the\nsuborbital [SpaceShipOne](/wiki/SpaceShipOne \"SpaceShipOne\"). The wings on\nthis craft rotate upward into the _feather configuration_ that provides a\n[shuttlecock](/wiki/Shuttlecock \"Shuttlecock\") effect. Thus SpaceShipOne\nachieves much more aerodynamic drag on reentry while not experiencing\nsignificant thermal loads.\n\nThe configuration increases drag, as the craft is now less streamlined and\nresults in more atmospheric gas particles hitting the spacecraft at higher\naltitudes than otherwise. The aircraft thus slows down more in higher\natmospheric layers which is the key to efficient reentry. Secondly the\naircraft will _automatically_ orient itself in this state to a high drag\nattitude.[40]\n\nHowever, the velocity attained by SpaceShipOne prior to reentry is much lower\nthan that of an orbital spacecraft, and engineers, including Rutan, recognize\nthat a feathered reentry technique is not suitable for return from orbit.\n\nOn 4 May 2011, the first test on the [SpaceShipTwo](/wiki/SpaceShipTwo\n\"SpaceShipTwo\") of the feathering mechanism was made during a glideflight\nafter release from the White Knight Two.\n\nThe feathered reentry was first described by [Dean\nChapman](/wiki/Dean_R._Chapman \"Dean R. Chapman\") of [NACA](/wiki/NACA \"NACA\")\nin 1958.[41] In the section of his report on _Composite Entry_ , Chapman\ndescribed a solution to the problem using a high-drag device:\n\n> It may be desirable to combine lifting and nonlifting entry in order to\n> achieve some advantages... For landing maneuverability it obviously is\n> advantageous to employ a lifting vehicle. The total heat absorbed by a\n> lifting vehicle, however, is much higher than for a nonlifting vehicle...\n> Nonlifting vehicles can more easily be constructed... by employing, for\n> example, a large, light drag device... The larger the device, the smaller is\n> the heating rate.\n>\n> Nonlifting vehicles with shuttlecock stability are advantageous also from\n> the viewpoint of minimum control requirements during entry.\n>\n> ... an evident composite type of entry, which combines some of the desirable\n> features of lifting and nonlifting trajectories, would be to enter first\n> without lift but with a... drag device; then, when the velocity is reduced\n> to a certain value... the device is jettisoned or retracted, leaving a\n> lifting vehicle... for the remainder of the descent.\n\n## Inflatable heat shield\nreentry[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=25\n\"Edit section: Inflatable heat shield reentry\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Inflatable_Re-\nentry_Vehicle_Experiment.jpg/220px-Inflatable_Re-\nentry_Vehicle_Experiment.jpg)](/wiki/File:Inflatable_Re-\nentry_Vehicle_Experiment.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Inflatable_Re-entry_Vehicle_Experiment.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNASA engineers check IRVE\n\nDeceleration for atmospheric reentry, especially for higher-speed Mars-return\nmissions, benefits from maximizing \"the drag area of the entry system. The\nlarger the diameter of the aeroshell, the bigger the payload can be.\"[42] An\ninflatable aeroshell provides one alternative for enlarging the drag area with\na low-mass design.\n\nSuch an inflatable shield/aerobrake was designed for the penetrators of [Mars\n96](/wiki/Mars_96 \"Mars 96\") mission. Since the mission failed due to the\nlauncher malfunction, the NPO Lavochkin and DASA/ESA have designed a mission\nfor Earth orbit. The Inflatable Reentry and Descent Technology (IRDT)\ndemonstrator was launched on Soyuz-Fregat on 8 February 2000. The inflatable\nshield was designed as a cone with two stages of inflation. Although the\nsecond stage of the shield failed to inflate, the demonstrator survived the\norbital reentry and was recovered.[43][44] The subsequent missions flown on\nthe [Volna](/wiki/Volna \"Volna\") rocket failed due to launcher failure.[45]\n\n### NASA\nIRVE[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit\nsection: NASA IRVE\")]\n\nNASA launched an inflatable heat shield experimental spacecraft on 17 August\n2009 with the successful first test flight of the Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle\nExperiment (IRVE). The heat shield had been [vacuum-\npacked](/wiki/Vacuum_packing \"Vacuum packing\") into a 15-inch (380 mm)\ndiameter payload shroud and launched on a [Black Brant\n9](/wiki/Black_Brant_\\(rocket\\) \"Black Brant \\(rocket\\)\") [sounding\nrocket](/wiki/Sounding_rocket \"Sounding rocket\") from NASA's Wallops Flight\nFacility on Wallops Island, Virginia. \"Nitrogen inflated the 10-foot (3.0 m)\ndiameter heat shield, made of several layers of [silicone](/wiki/Silicone\n\"Silicone\")-coated [[Kevlar](/wiki/Kevlar \"Kevlar\")] fabric, to a mushroom\nshape in space several minutes after liftoff.\"[42] The rocket apogee was at an\naltitude of 131 miles (211 km) where it began its descent to supersonic speed.\nLess than a minute later the shield was released from its cover to inflate at\nan altitude of 124 miles (200 km). The inflation of the shield took less than\n90 seconds.[42]\n\n### NASA\nHIAD[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=27 \"Edit\nsection: NASA HIAD\")]\n\nFollowing the success of the initial IRVE experiments, NASA developed the\nconcept into the more ambitious Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator\n(HIAD). The current design is shaped like a shallow cone, with the structure\nbuilt up as a stack of circular inflated tubes of gradually increasing major\ndiameter. The forward (convex) face of the cone is covered with a flexible\nthermal protection system robust enough to withstand the stresses of\natmospheric entry (or re-entry).[46] [47]\n\n## Entry vehicle design\nconsiderations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: Entry vehicle design considerations\")]\n\nThere are four critical parameters considered when designing a vehicle for\natmospheric entry:\n\n  1. Peak heat flux\n  2. Heat load\n  3. Peak deceleration\n  4. Peak dynamic pressure\n\nPeak heat flux and [dynamic pressure](/wiki/Dynamic_pressure \"Dynamic\npressure\") selects the TPS material. Heat load selects the thickness of the\nTPS material stack. Peak deceleration is of major importance for manned\nmissions. The upper limit for manned return to Earth from Low Earth Orbit\n(LEO) or lunar return is 10 Gs.[48] For Martian atmospheric entry after long\nexposure to zero gravity, the upper limit is 4 Gs.[48] Peak dynamic pressure\ncan also influence the selection of the outermost TPS material if spallation\nis an issue.\n\nStarting from the principle of _conservative design_ , the engineer typically\nconsiders two [worst case](/wiki/Worst_case \"Worst case\") trajectories, the\nundershoot and overshoot trajectories. The overshoot trajectory is typically\ndefined as the shallowest allowable entry velocity angle prior to atmospheric\n[skip-off](/wiki/Skip_reentry \"Skip reentry\"). The overshoot trajectory has\nthe highest heat load and sets the TPS thickness. The undershoot trajectory is\ndefined by the steepest allowable trajectory. For manned missions the steepest\nentry angle is limited by the peak deceleration. The undershoot trajectory\nalso has the highest peak heat flux and dynamic pressure. Consequently, the\nundershoot trajectory is the basis for selecting the TPS material. There is no\n\"one size fits all\" TPS material. A TPS material that is ideal for high heat\nflux may be too conductive (too dense) for a long duration heat load. A low\ndensity TPS material might lack the tensile strength to resist spallation if\nthe dynamic pressure is too high. A TPS material can perform well for a\nspecific peak heat flux, but fail catastrophically for the same peak heat flux\nif the wall pressure is significantly increased (this happened with NASA's R-4\ntest spacecraft).[48] Older TPS materials tend to be more labor-intensive and\nexpensive to manufacture compared to modern materials. However, modern TPS\nmaterials often lack the flight history of the older materials (an important\nconsideration for a risk-averse designer).\n\nBased upon Allen and Eggers discovery, maximum aeroshell bluntness (maximum\ndrag) yields minimum TPS mass. Maximum bluntness (minimum ballistic\ncoefficient) also yields a minimal [terminal velocity](/wiki/Terminal_velocity\n\"Terminal velocity\") at maximum altitude (very important for Mars EDL, but\ndetrimental for military RVs). However, there is an upper limit to bluntness\nimposed by aerodynamic stability considerations based upon _shock wave\ndetachment_. A shock wave will remain attached to the tip of a sharp cone if\nthe cone's half-angle is below a critical value. This critical half-angle can\nbe estimated using perfect gas theory (this specific aerodynamic instability\noccurs below hypersonic speeds). For a nitrogen atmosphere (Earth or Titan),\nthe maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 60°. For a carbon dioxide\natmosphere (Mars or Venus), the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately\n70°. After shock wave detachment, an entry vehicle must carry significantly\nmore shocklayer gas around the leading edge stagnation point (the subsonic\ncap). Consequently, the aerodynamic center moves upstream thus causing\naerodynamic instability. It is incorrect to reapply an aeroshell design\nintended for Titan entry ([Huygens probe](/wiki/Huygens_probe \"Huygens probe\")\nin a nitrogen atmosphere) for Mars entry ([Beagle-2](/wiki/Beagle_2 \"Beagle\n2\") in a carbon dioxide atmosphere).[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_][_[original research?](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research\n\"Wikipedia:No original research\")_] Prior to being abandoned, the [Soviet Mars\nlander program](/wiki/Mars_probe_program \"Mars probe program\") achieved one\nsuccessful landing ([Mars 3](/wiki/Mars_3 \"Mars 3\")), on the second of three\nentry attempts (the others were [Mars 2](/wiki/Mars_2 \"Mars 2\") and [Mars\n6](/wiki/Mars_6 \"Mars 6\")). The Soviet Mars landers were based upon a 60°\nhalf-angle aeroshell design.\n\nA 45 degree half-angle sphere-cone is typically used for atmospheric probes\n(surface landing not intended) even though TPS mass is not minimized. The\nrationale for a 45° half-angle is to have either aerodynamic stability from\nentry-to-impact (the heat shield is not jettisoned) or a short-and-sharp heat\npulse followed by prompt heat shield jettison. A 45° sphere-cone design was\nused with the DS/2 Mars [impactor](/wiki/Impactor_\\(spacecraft\\) \"Impactor\n\\(spacecraft\\)\") and [Pioneer Venus Probes](/wiki/Pioneer_Venus_project\n\"Pioneer Venus project\").\n\n## Notable atmospheric entry\naccidents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_entry&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Notable atmospheric entry accidents\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Ingreso_reentrada.svg/800px-\nIngreso_reentrada.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Ingreso_reentrada.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ingreso_reentrada.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRe-entry window A- Friction with air, B- In air flight.

                "Query Analysis": "The query asks for the speed at which the space shuttle re-enters Earth.",
                "Query Keywords Extraction": "speed, space shuttle, re-enter Earth",
                "Answer Analysis": "The provided answer suggests '100 km', presumably indicating a speed measurement.",
                "Document Content Analysis": "The document discusses the history and incidents involving the space shuttle program, including details about shuttle launches, missions, the Challenger disaster, and Columbia disaster. It touches on how the shuttle re-enters Earth's atmosphere by firing engines to reduce speed and land like a glider.",
                "Document and Query Keywords Matching": "The document mentions 'space shuttle' and indirectly covers the concept of re-entry through the description of shuttle missions.",
                "Document and Answer Keywords Matching": "While the document discusses re-entry, it does not contain specific speed measurements or the '100 km' figure mentioned in the answer.",
                "Key Information Matching": "The document provides context about the space shuttle's method of re-entry but lacks specific details about the speed at re-entry.",
                "Can the Document Answer the Query": "No, the document does not provide explicit information regarding the speed of re-entry for the space shuttle.",
                "Can the Document Help Infer Additional Information Required by the Query": "Yes, the document provides relevant context on how the space shuttle re-enters Earth's atmosphere, which can assist with understanding the process, though not the speed itself.",
                "Relevance Judgement": "1",
                "Explanation": "The document contains background information about the space shuttle and its re-entry process but does not directly address the speed of re-entry. Hence, while it is partially relevant by providing context, it does not provide the complete answer."
