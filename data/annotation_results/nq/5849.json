Since 1990, the\nprize is awarded on 10 December in [Oslo City Hall](/wiki/Oslo_City_Hall \"Oslo\nCity Hall\") each year.

As he was a trained chemical\nengineer, the categories for [chemistry](/wiki/Chemistry \"Chemistry\") and\n[physics](/wiki/Physics \"Physics\") were obvious choices. The reasoning behind\nthe peace prize is less clear. According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, his\nfriendship with [Bertha von Suttner](/wiki/Bertha_von_Suttner \"Bertha von\nSuttner\"), a peace activist and later recipient of the prize, profoundly\ninfluenced his decision to include peace as a category.[6] Some Nobel scholars\nsuggest it was Nobel's way to compensate for developing destructive forces.\nHis inventions included [dynamite](/wiki/Dynamite \"Dynamite\") and\n[ballistite](/wiki/Ballistite \"Ballistite\"), both of which were used violently\nduring his lifetime. Ballistite was used in war[7] and the [Irish Republican\nBrotherhood](/wiki/Irish_Republican_Brotherhood \"Irish Republican\nBrotherhood\"), an Irish nationalist organization, carried out dynamite attacks\nin the 1880s.[8] Nobel was also instrumental in turning [Bofors](/wiki/Bofors\n\"Bofors\") from an iron and steel producer into an armaments company.\n\nIt is unclear why Nobel wished the Peace Prize to be administered in Norway,\nwhich was [ruled](/wiki/Personal_union \"Personal union\") in [union with\nSweden](/wiki/Union_between_Sweden_and_Norway \"Union between Sweden and\nNorway\") at the time of Nobel's death. The Norwegian Nobel Committee\nspeculates that Nobel may have considered Norway better suited to awarding the\nprize, as it did not have the same militaristic traditions as\n[Sweden](/wiki/Sweden \"Sweden\"). It also notes that at the end of the 19th\ncentury, the [Norwegian parliament](/wiki/Norwegian_parliament \"Norwegian\nparliament\") had become closely involved in the [Inter-Parliamentary\nUnion](/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Union \"Inter-Parliamentary Union\")'s efforts\nto resolve conflicts through mediation and arbitration.[6]\n\n## Nomination and\nselection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nobel_Peace_Prize&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Nomination and selection\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Norske_nobelinstiutt_1.jpg/220px-\nNorske_nobelinstiutt_1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Norske_nobelinstiutt_1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Norske_nobelinstiutt_1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Norwegian Nobel Institute](/wiki/Norwegian_Nobel_Institute \"Norwegian\nNobel Institute\") in [Oslo, Norway](/wiki/Oslo \"Oslo\")\n\nThe [Norwegian Parliament](/wiki/Stortinget \"Stortinget\") appoints the\n[Norwegian Nobel Committee](/wiki/Norwegian_Nobel_Committee \"Norwegian Nobel\nCommittee\"), which selects the [Nobel Peace Prize\nlaureate](/wiki/List_of_Nobel_Peace_Prize_laureates \"List of Nobel Peace Prize\nlaureates\").\n\n###\nNomination[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nobel_Peace_Prize&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Nomination\")]\n\nEach year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee specifically invites qualified people\nto submit nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize.[9] The statutes of the Nobel\nFoundation specify categories of individuals who are eligible to make\nnominations for the Nobel Peace Prize.[10] These nominators are:\n\n  * Members of national assemblies and governments and members of the [Inter-Parliamentary Union](/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Union \"Inter-Parliamentary Union\")\n  * Members of the [Permanent Court of Arbitration](/wiki/Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration \"Permanent Court of Arbitration\") and the [International Court of Justice](/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice \"International Court of Justice\") at the Hague\n  * Members of [Institut de Droit International](/wiki/Institut_de_Droit_International \"Institut de Droit International\")\n  * University professors of history, [social sciences](/wiki/Social_science \"Social science\"), philosophy, law, and theology, university presidents, and directors of peace research and international affairs institutes\n  * [Former recipients](/wiki/List_of_Nobel_Peace_Prize_laureates \"List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates\"), including board members of organizations that have previously received the prize\n  * Present and past members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n  * Former permanent advisers to the [Norwegian Nobel Institute](/wiki/Norwegian_Nobel_Institute \"Norwegian Nobel Institute\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Dalai_Lama_and_Bishop_Tutu._Carey_Linde.jpg/220px-\nDalai_Lama_and_Bishop_Tutu._Carey_Linde.jpg)](/wiki/File:Dalai_Lama_and_Bishop_Tutu._Carey_Linde.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Dalai_Lama_and_Bishop_Tutu._Carey_Linde.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [14th Dalai Lama](/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama \"14th Dalai Lama\") and [Archbishop\nDesmond Tutu](/wiki/Desmond_Tutu \"Desmond Tutu\"), Nobel Peace Prize laureates\n\nNominations must usually be submitted to the Committee by the beginning of\nFebruary in the award year. Nominations by committee members can be submitted\nup to the date of the first Committee meeting after this deadline.[10]\n\nIn 2009, a record 205 nominations were received,[11] but the record was broken\nagain in 2010 with 237 nominations; in 2011, the record was broken once again\nwith 241 nominations.[12] The statutes of the Nobel Foundation do not allow\ninformation about nominations, considerations, or investigations relating to\nawarding the prize to be made public for at least 50 years after a prize has\nbeen awarded.[13] Over time, many individuals have become known as \"Nobel\nPeace Prize Nominees\", but this designation has no official standing, and\nmeans only that one of the thousands of eligible nominators suggested the\nperson's name for consideration.[14] Indeed, in 1939, [Adolf\nHitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler \"Adolf Hitler\") received a satirical nomination\nfrom a member of the Swedish parliament, mocking the (serious but\nunsuccessful) nomination of [Neville Chamberlain](/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain\n\"Neville Chamberlain\").[15] Nominations from 1901 to 1956, however, have been\nreleased in a database.[16]\n\n###\nSelection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nobel_Peace_Prize&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Selection\")]\n\nNominations are considered by the Nobel Committee at a meeting where a short\nlist of candidates for further review is created. This short list is then\nconsidered by permanent advisers to the Nobel institute, which consists of the\nInstitute's Director and the Research Director and a small number of Norwegian\nacademics with expertise in subject areas relating to the prize. Advisers\nusually have some months to complete reports, which are then considered by the\nCommittee to select the laureate. The Committee seeks to achieve a unanimous\ndecision, but this is not always possible. The Nobel Committee typically comes\nto a conclusion in mid-September, but occasionally the final decision has not\nbeen made until the last meeting before the official announcement at the\nbeginning of October.[17]\n\n## Awarding the\nprize[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nobel_Peace_Prize&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Awarding the prize\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/1933_Nobel_Peace_Prize_awarded_to_Norman_Angell.JPG/150px-1933_Nobel_Peace_Prize_awarded_to_Norman_Angell.JPG)](/wiki/File:1933_Nobel_Peace_Prize_awarded_to_Norman_Angell.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1933_Nobel_Peace_Prize_awarded_to_Norman_Angell.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nObverse of the Nobel Peace Prize Medal presented to [Sir Ralph Norman\nAngell](/wiki/Norman_Angell \"Norman Angell\") in 1933; the [Imperial War\nMuseum](/wiki/Imperial_War_Museum \"Imperial War Museum\"), London\n\nThe [Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel\nCommittee](/wiki/Norwegian_Nobel_Committee \"Norwegian Nobel Committee\")\npresents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the [King of\nNorway](/wiki/Monarchy_of_Norway \"Monarchy of Norway\") on 10 December each\nyear (the anniversary of Nobel's death). The Peace Prize is the only Nobel\nPrize not presented in [Stockholm](/wiki/Stockholm \"Stockholm\"). The Nobel\nlaureate receives a diploma, a medal, and a document confirming the prize\namount.[18] As of\n2013[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nobel_Peace_Prize&action=edit),\nthe prize was worth 10 million [SEK](/wiki/Swedish_krona \"Swedish krona\")\n(about US$1.5 million). Since 1990, the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony is held at\n[Oslo City Hall](/wiki/Oslo_City_Hall \"Oslo City Hall\").\n\nFrom 1947 to 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held in the Atrium of\nthe [University of Oslo Faculty of\nLaw](/wiki/Faculty_of_Law,_University_of_Oslo \"Faculty of Law, University of\nOslo\"), a few hundred metres from Oslo City Hall. Between 1905 and 1946, the\nceremony took place at the [Norwegian Nobel\nInstitute](/wiki/Norwegian_Nobel_Institute \"Norwegian Nobel Institute\"). From\n1901 to 1904, the ceremony took place in the\n_[Storting](/wiki/Parliament_of_Norway_Building \"Parliament of Norway\nBuilding\")_ (Parliament).[19]\n\n## Criticism[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nobel_Peace_Prize&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Criticism\")]\n\nIt has been expressed that the Peace Prize has been awarded in politically\nmotivated ways for more recent or immediate achievements,[20] or with the\nintention of encouraging future achievements.[20][21] Some commentators have\nsuggested that to award a peace prize on the basis of unquantifiable\ncontemporary opinion is unjust or possibly erroneous, especially as many of\nthe judges cannot themselves be said to be impartial observers.[22]\n\nIn 2011, a feature story in the Norwegian newspaper\n_[Aftenposten](/wiki/Aftenposten \"Aftenposten\")_ contended that major\ncriticisms of the award were that the [Norwegian Nobel\nCommittee](/wiki/Norwegian_Nobel_Committee \"Norwegian Nobel Committee\") ought\nto recruit members from professional and international backgrounds, rather\nthan retired members of parliament; that there is too little openness about\nthe criteria that the committee uses when they choose a recipient of the\nprize; and that the adherence to Nobel's will should be more strict. In the\narticle, Norwegian historian [Øivind\nStenersen](/w/index.php?title=%C3%98ivind_Stenersen&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Øivind Stenersen \\(page does not exist\\)\") argues that Norway has been able\nto use the prize as an instrument for nation building and furthering Norway's\nforeign policy and economic interests.[23]\n\nIn another 2011 _Aftenposten_ opinion article, the grandson of one of Nobel's\ntwo brothers, Michael Nobel, also criticised what he believed to be the\npoliticisation of the award, claiming that the Nobel Committee has not always\nacted in accordance with Nobel's will.[24] Norwegian lawyer [Fredrik S.\nHeffermehl](/wiki/Fredrik_S._Heffermehl \"Fredrik S. Heffermehl\") has\ncriticized the management of the Peace Prize.[25]\n\n### Criticism of individual\nconferments[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nobel_Peace_Prize&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Criticism of individual conferments\")]\n\nMain article: [Nobel Prize controversies](/wiki/Nobel_Prize_controversies\n\"Nobel Prize controversies\")\n\n[![Barack Obama with Thorbjørn\nJagland](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Jagland_and_Obama.jpg/220px-\nJagland_and_Obama.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jagland_and_Obama.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Jagland_and_Obama.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBarack Obama with [Thorbjørn Jagland](/wiki/Thorbj%C3%B8rn_Jagland \"Thorbjørn\nJagland\") at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Flickr_-\n_Government_Press_Office_%28GPO%29_-_THE_NOBEL_PEACE_PRIZE_LAUREATES_FOR_1994_IN_OSLO..jpg/220px-\nFlickr_-\n_Government_Press_Office_%28GPO%29_-_THE_NOBEL_PEACE_PRIZE_LAUREATES_FOR_1994_IN_OSLO..jpg)](/wiki/File:Flickr_-\n_Government_Press_Office_\\(GPO\\)_-_THE_NOBEL_PEACE_PRIZE_LAUREATES_FOR_1994_IN_OSLO..jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Flickr_-\n_Government_Press_Office_\\(GPO\\)_-_THE_NOBEL_PEACE_PRIZE_LAUREATES_FOR_1994_IN_OSLO..jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nFrom left-to-right, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin receiving\nthe 1994 Nobel Peace Prize following the Oslo Accords\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Friedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg/220px-\nFriedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg)](/wiki/File:Friedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Friedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nNobel Peace Prize 2001 [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\")\n\\- diploma in the lobby of the [United Nations\nHeadquarters](/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters \"United Nations Headquarters\")\nin [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\")\n\nThe awards given to [Mikhail Gorbachev](/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev \"Mikhail\nGorbachev\"),[26] [Yitzhak Rabin](/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin \"Yitzhak Rabin\"), [Shimon\nPeres](/wiki/Shimon_Peres \"Shimon Peres\"), [Menachem\nBegin](/wiki/Menachem_Begin \"Menachem Begin\") and [Yasser\nArafat](/wiki/Yasser_Arafat \"Yasser Arafat\"),[27][28] [Lê Đức\nThọ](/wiki/L%C3%AA_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_Th%E1%BB%8D \"Lê Đức Thọ\"), [Henry\nKissinger](/wiki/Henry_Kissinger \"Henry Kissinger\"),[29] [Jimmy\nCarter](/wiki/Jimmy_Carter \"Jimmy Carter\"),[30] [Al Gore](/wiki/Al_Gore \"Al\nGore\"),[31] [IPCC](/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change\n\"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\"),[32] [Liu\nXiaobo](/wiki/Liu_Xiaobo \"Liu Xiaobo\"),[33][34][35] [Aung San Suu\nKyi](/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi \"Aung San Suu Kyi\")[36][37][38] [Barack\nObama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\"),[39][40][41][42] and the [European\nUnion](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\")[43] have all been the subject of\ncontroversy.\n\nThe awards given to [Lê Đức Thọ](/wiki/L%C3%AA_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_Th%E1%BB%8D\n\"Lê Đức Thọ\") and [Henry Kissinger](/wiki/Henry_Kissinger \"Henry Kissinger\")\nprompted two dissenting Committee members to resign.[44] Thọ refused to accept\nthe prize, on the grounds that such \"bourgeois sentimentalities\" were not for\nhim[45] and that peace had not actually been achieved in Vietnam.

Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace\nprize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question\".[55] In\n1948, following Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize\non the ground that \"there was no suitable living candidate\" that year.
