He goes to drink alone\nat a bar, where a young, beautiful woman walks in. She sees that Danny has a\nwedding ring on his hand, and asks him about his wife, to which he explains\nhow she recently left him for someone else, and the woman from the bar ends up\nsleeping with him.\n\nTwenty-three years later, Danny (now 45-years old) is now a successful\n[plastic surgeon](/wiki/Plastic_surgeon \"Plastic surgeon\") in [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\") who feigns unhappy marriages to get\nwomen, and to avoid romantic commitment that may lead to heartbreak. The only\nwoman aware of his schemes is his office manager and best friend Katherine\nMurphy ([Jennifer Aniston](/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston \"Jennifer Aniston\")), a\ndivorced mother of two. At a party, Danny meets Palmer ([Brooklyn\nDecker](/wiki/Brooklyn_Decker \"Brooklyn Decker\")), a sixth grade math teacher,\nwithout his wedding ring on, and they have a connection together. The next\nmorning, she finds the ring and assumes he is married. She refuses to date him\nbecause her parents divorced due to [adultery](/wiki/Adultery \"Adultery\").\n\nInstead of telling her the truth, Danny tells her that he is getting divorced\nfrom a woman named Devlin. Danny tells Palmer that they are getting divorced\nbecause she cheated on him with a man named \"Dolph Lundgren\" (not [the\nactor](/wiki/Dolph_Lundgren \"Dolph Lundgren\")). Palmer then insists on meeting\nDevlin. Danny asks Katherine to pose as \"Devlin\" and they go shopping for new\nclothes to dress like a [trophy wife](/wiki/Trophy_wife \"Trophy wife\").\n\nA made-over Katherine/\"Devlin\" then meets with Danny and Palmer and gives them\nher blessing. However, after hearing Katherine talking on the phone with her\nkids, Palmer assumes that her kids are Danny's as well. Danny then privately\nmeets with Katherine's kids, Maggie ([Bailee Madison](/wiki/Bailee_Madison\n\"Bailee Madison\")) and Michael ([Griffin Gluck](/wiki/Griffin_Gluck \"Griffin\nGluck\")), to get them to play along and gives them the aliases of \"Kiki Dee\"\nand \"Bart\" respectively. Danny accepts their demands for being his fake\nchildren.\n\nPalmer meets the kids at a play center where Maggie has adopted a fake british\naccent, and Michael acts very morose. They [blackmail](/wiki/Blackmail\n\"Blackmail\") Danny in front of Palmer to take them all to\n[Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\"). At the airport, they are all surprised by\nDanny's goofball cousin Eddie ([Nick Swardson](/wiki/Nick_Swardson \"Nick\nSwardson\")), who has adopted an Austrian disguise as the \"Dolph Lundgren\" that\nDanny had made up earlier. To maintain the lies, Danny and Katherine are\nforced to bring him along.\n\nAt the resort in Hawaii, Danny tells Eddie that he is considering asking\nPalmer to marry him. Katherine and Danny also run into the real-life Devlin\nAdams ([Nicole Kidman](/wiki/Nicole_Kidman \"Nicole Kidman\")) and her husband\nIan Maxtone-Jones ([Dave Matthews](/wiki/Dave_Matthews \"Dave Matthews\")).\nBecause of Katherine and Devlin's long-time rivalry, Katherine introduces\nDanny as her husband rather than admit she is a [single\nmother](/wiki/Single_mother \"Single mother\"). Over time, Katherine is\nimpressed by Danny and his way of fun with her kids.\n\nKatherine again runs into Devlin, who invites her and Danny out to dinner.\nEddie agrees to take Palmer out to dinner so that Danny can go with Katherine.\nSince he is supposed to be a sheep salesman, Eddie's cover is nearly blown\nwhen he is forced to save the life of an actual sheep who choked on a toy\nwhistle. At dinner, Devlin asks Danny and Katherine to tell each other what\nthey admire most about each other, and, as Danny and Katherine talk, they\nstart to feel a connection. Later, when Palmer and Eddie return from their\ndinner date, Palmer suggests that she and Danny get married now, since a\ndrunken Eddie told her about Danny's plans of engagement. Danny and Katherine\nare both surprised by her proposition, but Danny ultimately agrees. Danny\nlater calls Katherine regarding his confusion, but Katherine says that she\nwill be taking a job in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\")\nto get a fresh start to her life.\n\nThe next day, Palmer confronts Katherine about Danny's feelings for her, which\nKatherine dismisses. Katherine then runs into Devlin at a bar and admits that\nshe pretended to be married to Danny to avoid embarrassment. Devlin confesses\nthat she is divorcing Ian because he is [gay](/wiki/Gay \"Gay\") and also that\nhe did not invent the iPod, but made his money by suing the [Los Angeles\nDodgers](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers \"Los Angeles Dodgers\") after getting hit by\na foul ball. Katherine confides in Devlin about being in love with Danny, but\nthen Danny shows up behind her, saying that he is not marrying Palmer and that\nhe is in love with Katherine. Meanwhile, on the plane ride back to the\nmainland, Palmer meets a professional tennis player ([Andy\nRoddick](/wiki/Andy_Roddick \"Andy Roddick\")) who shares her interests.\nSometime later, Danny and Katherine get married.\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Just_Go_with_It&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Adam Sandler](/wiki/Adam_Sandler \"Adam Sandler\") as Dr. Daniel \"Danny\" Maccabee\n  * [Jennifer Aniston](/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston \"Jennifer Aniston\") as Katherine Murphy, later Maccabee / Devlin Maccabee\n  * [Bailee Madison](/wiki/Bailee_Madison \"Bailee Madison\") as Maggie Murphy / Kiki Dee Maccabee\n  * [Griffin Gluck](/wiki/Griffin_Gluck \"Griffin Gluck\") as Michael Murphy / Bart Maccabee\n  * [Nick Swardson](/wiki/Nick_Swardson \"Nick Swardson\") as Eddie Simms / Dolph Lundgren\n  * [Brooklyn Decker](/wiki/Brooklyn_Decker \"Brooklyn Decker\") as Palmer Dodge\n  * [Nicole Kidman](/wiki/Nicole_Kidman \"Nicole Kidman\") as Devlin Adams\n  * [Dave Matthews](/wiki/Dave_Matthews \"Dave Matthews\") as Ian Maxtone-Jones\n  * [Rachel Dratch](/wiki/Rachel_Dratch \"Rachel Dratch\") as Kirsten Brant\n  * [Kevin Nealon](/wiki/Kevin_Nealon \"Kevin Nealon\") as Adon\n  * [Heidi Montag](/wiki/Heidi_Montag \"Heidi Montag\") as Kimberly\n  * [Minka Kelly](/wiki/Minka_Kelly \"Minka Kelly\") as Joanna Damon\n  * Rakefet Abergel as Patricia\n  * [Dan Patrick](/wiki/Dan_Patrick \"Dan Patrick\") as Tanner Patrick\n  * [Mario Joyner](/wiki/Mario_Joyner \"Mario Joyner\") as Henderson\n  * [Keegan-Michael Key](/wiki/Keegan-Michael_Key \"Keegan-Michael Key\") as Ernesto\n  * [Allen Covert](/wiki/Allen_Covert \"Allen Covert\") as Brian (Soul Patch)\n  * [Andy Roddick](/wiki/Andy_Roddick \"Andy Roddick\") as Himself\n  * [Jake Shimabukuro](/wiki/Jake_Shimabukuro \"Jake Shimabukuro\") as ukulele player\n  * Unknown as the Kangaroo\n\n## Production[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Just_Go_with_It&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nOriginally titled \"Holiday in Hawaii\", and then \"Pretend Wife\",[3] it was\nreleased as \"Just Go with It\".\n\nThe film was shot in [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\") and the\n[Hawaiian](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\") islands of [Maui](/wiki/Maui \"Maui\") and\n[Kauai](/wiki/Kauai \"Kauai\") between March 2, 2010 and May 25,\n2010.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_] The film is deliberately vague about which Hawaiian island its\nlatter portion depicts; thus, the characters hike across a rope bridge on Maui\nand arrive in the next scene at a spectacular waterfall on Kauai, rather than\nthe ordinary irrigation dam and pond on Maui where the actual trail\nterminates.\n\nThe characters stay at a Hawaiian hotel called the [Waldorf\nAstoria](/wiki/Waldorf_Astoria \"Waldorf Astoria\").
