It is\nproduced by the specialised ependymal cells in the [choroid\nplexuses](/wiki/Choroid_plexus \"Choroid plexus\") of the\n[ventricles](/wiki/Ventricular_system \"Ventricular system\") of the brain, and\nabsorbed in the [arachnoid granulations](/wiki/Arachnoid_granulation\n\"Arachnoid granulation\"). There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and\nabout 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the\nbrain, providing basic mechanical and [immunological](/wiki/Immunological\n\"Immunological\") protection to the brain inside the [skull](/wiki/Human_skull\n\"Human skull\"). CSF also serves a vital function in [cerebral\nautoregulation](/wiki/Cerebral_autoregulation \"Cerebral autoregulation\") of\n[cerebral blood flow](/wiki/Cerebral_blood_flow \"Cerebral blood flow\").\n\nCSF occupies the [subarachnoid space](/wiki/Subarachnoid_space \"Subarachnoid\nspace\") (between the [arachnoid mater](/wiki/Arachnoid_mater \"Arachnoid\nmater\") and the [pia mater](/wiki/Pia_mater \"Pia mater\")) and the [ventricular\nsystem](/wiki/Ventricular_system \"Ventricular system\") around and inside the\nbrain and spinal cord. It fills the [ventricles](/wiki/Ventricular_system\n\"Ventricular system\") of the brain, [cisterns](/wiki/Subarachnoid_cisterns\n\"Subarachnoid cisterns\"), and [sulci](/wiki/Sulcus_\\(neuroanatomy\\) \"Sulcus\n\\(neuroanatomy\\)\"), as well as the [central canal](/wiki/Central_canal\n\"Central canal\") of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the\nsubarachnoid space to the [bony labyrinth](/wiki/Bony_labyrinth \"Bony\nlabyrinth\") of the [inner ear](/wiki/Inner_ear \"Inner ear\") via the\n[perilymphatic duct](/wiki/Perilymphatic_duct \"Perilymphatic duct\") where the\n[perilymph](/wiki/Perilymph \"Perilymph\") is continuous with the cerebrospinal\nfluid.\n\nA sample of CSF can be taken via [lumbar puncture](/wiki/Lumbar_puncture\n\"Lumbar puncture\").

The ventricles are a series of cavities filled with CSF. The\nmajority of CSF is produced from within the two [lateral\nventricles](/wiki/Lateral_ventricles \"Lateral ventricles\"). From here, CSF\npasses through the [interventricular\nforamina](/wiki/Interventricular_foramina_\\(neuroanatomy\\) \"Interventricular\nforamina \\(neuroanatomy\\)\") to the [third ventricle](/wiki/Third_ventricle\n\"Third ventricle\"), then the [cerebral aqueduct](/wiki/Cerebral_aqueduct\n\"Cerebral aqueduct\") to the [fourth ventricle](/wiki/Fourth_ventricle \"Fourth\nventricle\"). From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the\n[subarachnoid space](/wiki/Subarachnoid_space \"Subarachnoid space\") through\nfour openings – the [central canal](/wiki/Central_canal \"Central canal\") of\nthe spinal cord, the [median aperture](/wiki/Median_aperture \"Median\naperture\"), and the two [lateral apertures](/wiki/Lateral_aperture \"Lateral\naperture\").[1] CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the\nbrain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the\n[sacrum](/wiki/Sacrum \"Sacrum\").[1][2] There is a connection from the\nsubarachnoid space to the [bony labyrinth](/wiki/Bony_labyrinth \"Bony\nlabyrinth\") of the [inner ear](/wiki/Inner_ear \"Inner ear\") making the\ncerebrospinal fluid continuous with the [perilymph](/wiki/Perilymph\n\"Perilymph\") in 93% of people.[3]\n\nCSF moves in a single outward direction from the ventricles, but\nmultidirectionally in the subarachnoid space.[3] Fluid movement is pulsatile,\nmatching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the\nheart.[3] Some authors dispute this, posing that there is no unidirectional\nCSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic\nto-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.[4]\n\n###\nContents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Contents\")]\n\nCSF is derived from [blood plasma](/wiki/Blood_plasma \"Blood plasma\") and is\nlargely similar to it, except that CSF is nearly protein-free compared with\nplasma and has some different [electrolyte](/wiki/Electrolyte \"Electrolyte\")\nlevels. Due to the way it is produced, CSF has a higher\n[chloride](/wiki/Chloride \"Chloride\") level than plasma, and an equivalent\n[sodium](/wiki/Sodium \"Sodium\") level.[2][5]\n\nCSF contains approximately 0.3% plasma proteins, or approximately 15 to 40\nmg/dL, depending on sampling site.[6] In general, globular proteins and\nalbumin are in lower concentration in ventricular CSF compared to lumbar or\ncisternal fluid.[7] This continuous flow into the [venous\nsystem](/wiki/Venous_system \"Venous system\") dilutes the concentration of\nlarger, lipid-insoluble molecules penetrating the brain and CSF.[8] CSF is\nnormally free of [red blood cells](/wiki/Red_blood_cell \"Red blood cell\"), and\nat most contains only a few [white blood cells](/wiki/White_blood_cell \"White\nblood cell\"). Any white blood [cell count](/wiki/Cell_counting \"Cell\ncounting\") higher than this constitutes [pleocytosis](/wiki/Pleocytosis\n\"Pleocytosis\").[9]\n\n##\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nAt around the third week of [development](/wiki/Human_embryogenesis \"Human\nembryogenesis\"), the [embryo](/wiki/Embryo \"Embryo\") is a three-layered disc,\ncovered with [ectoderm](/wiki/Ectoderm \"Ectoderm\"), [mesoderm](/wiki/Mesoderm\n\"Mesoderm\") and [endoderm](/wiki/Endoderm \"Endoderm\"). A tube-like formation\ndevelops in the midline, called the [notochord](/wiki/Notochord \"Notochord\").\nThe notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation\nof the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue.[10] The [neural\ntube](/wiki/Neural_tube \"Neural tube\"), forming from the ectoderm, contains\nCSF prior to the development of the choroid plexuses.[3] The open\n[neuropores](/wiki/Neuropore \"Neuropore\") of the neural tube close after the\nfirst month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.[3]\n\nAs the [brain develops](/wiki/Brain#Development \"Brain\"), by the fourth week\nof embryological development three swellings have formed within the embryo\naround the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent\ndifferent components of the [central nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Central_nervous_system \"Central nervous system\"): the\n[prosencephalon](/wiki/Prosencephalon \"Prosencephalon\"),\n[mesencephalon](/wiki/Mesencephalon \"Mesencephalon\") and\n[rhombencephalon](/wiki/Rhombencephalon \"Rhombencephalon\").[10] Subarachnoid\nspaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the\nrhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day.[3] At this time,\nthe first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although\nthe time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.[3]\n\nThe developing forebrain surrounds the neural cord. As the forebrain develops,\nthe neural cord within it becomes a ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral\nventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall\nremains thin, and a [choroid plexus](/wiki/Choroid_plexus \"Choroid plexus\")\ndevelops, producing and releasing CSF.[10] CSF quickly fills the neural\ncanal.[10] Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development,\nwith aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing\nuntil 18 months of age.[3]\n\nThe [subcommissural organ](/wiki/Subcommissural_organ \"Subcommissural organ\")\nsecretes [SCO-spondin](/wiki/SCO-spondin \"SCO-spondin\"), which forms\n[Reissner's fiber](/wiki/Reissner%27s_fiber \"Reissner's fiber\") within CSF\nassisting movement through the cerebral aqueduct. It is present in early\nintra-uterine life but disappears during early development.[3]\n\n##\nPhysiology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Physiology\")]\n\n###\nFunction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Function\")]\n\nCSF serves several purposes:\n\n  1. **Buoyancy:** The actual [mass](/wiki/Mass \"Mass\") of the [human brain](/wiki/Human_brain \"Human brain\") is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net [weight](/wiki/Weight \"Weight\") of the brain suspended in CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams.[11][1] The brain therefore exists in [neutral buoyancy](/wiki/Neutral_buoyancy \"Neutral buoyancy\"), which allows the brain to maintain its [density](/wiki/Density \"Density\") without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill [neurons](/wiki/Neuron \"Neuron\") in the lower sections without CSF.[5]\n  2. **Protection:** CSF protects the brain tissue from injury when jolted or hit, by providing a fluid buffer that acts as a [shock absorber](/wiki/Shock_absorber \"Shock absorber\") from some forms of mechanical injury.[1][5]\n  3. **Prevention of brain[ischemia](/wiki/Ischemia \"Ischemia\"):** The prevention of brain ischemia is made by decreasing the amount of CSF in the limited space inside the skull. This decreases total [intracranial pressure](/wiki/Intracranial_pressure \"Intracranial pressure\") and facilitates blood [perfusion](/wiki/Perfusion \"Perfusion\").[1]\n  4. **[Homeostasis](/wiki/Homeostasis \"Homeostasis\"):** CSF allows for regulation of the distribution of substances between cells of the brain,[3] and [neuroendocrine](/wiki/Neuroendocrine \"Neuroendocrine\") factors, to which slight changes can cause problems or damage to the nervous system. For example, high [glycine](/wiki/Glycine \"Glycine\") [concentration](/wiki/Concentration \"Concentration\") disrupts [temperature](/wiki/Temperature \"Temperature\") and [blood pressure](/wiki/Blood_pressure \"Blood pressure\") control, and high CSF [pH](/wiki/PH \"PH\") causes [dizziness](/wiki/Dizziness \"Dizziness\") and [syncope](/wiki/Syncope_\\(medicine\\) \"Syncope \\(medicine\\)\").[5]\n  5. **Clearing waste:** CSF allows for the removal of waste products from the brain,[1] and is critical in the brain's [lymphatic system](/wiki/Lymphatic_system \"Lymphatic system\").[12] Metabolic waste products [diffuse](/wiki/Diffusion \"Diffusion\") rapidly into CSF and are removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.[13]\n\n###\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nComparison of Average Serum and Cerebrospinal Fluid  Substance | CSF | Serum   \n---|---|---  \nWater Content (%) | 99 | 93   \nProtein (mg/dL) | 35 | 7000   \nGlucose (mg/dL) | 60 | 90   \nOsmolarity (mOsm/L) | 295 | 295   \n[Sodium](/wiki/Sodium \"Sodium\") (mEq/L) | 138 | 138   \n[Potassium](/wiki/Potassium \"Potassium\") (mEq/L) | 2.8 | 4.5   \n[Calcium](/wiki/Calcium \"Calcium\") (mEq/L) | 2.1 | 4.8   \n[Magnesium](/wiki/Magnesium \"Magnesium\") (mEq/L) | 2.0–2.5[14] | 1.7   \n[Chloride](/wiki/Chloride \"Chloride\") (mEq/L) | 119 | 102   \npH | 7.33 | 7.41   \n  \nThe brain produces roughly 500 mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day,[2] at a rate\nof about 25 mL an hour.[1] This [transcellular\nfluid](/wiki/Transcellular_fluid \"Transcellular fluid\") is constantly\nreabsorbed, so that only 125–150 mL is present at any one time.[1]\n\nCSF volume is higher on a mL/kg basis in children compared to adults. Infants\nhave a CSF volume of 4 mL/kg, children have a CSF volume of 3 mL/kg, and\nadults have a CSF volume of 1.5-2 mL/kg. A high CSF volume is why a larger\ndose of local anesthetic, on a mL/kg basis, is needed in infants.\nAdditionally, the larger CSF volume may be one reason as to why children have\nlower rates of postdural puncture headache.[15]\n\nMost (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is produced by the [choroid\nplexus](/wiki/Choroid_plexus \"Choroid plexus\").[1][2] The choroid plexus is a\nnetwork of blood vessels present within sections of the [four\nventricles](/wiki/Ventricular_system \"Ventricular system\") of the brain. It is\npresent throughout the [ventricular system](/wiki/Ventricular_system\n\"Ventricular system\") except for the [cerebral\naqueduct](/wiki/Cerebral_aqueduct \"Cerebral aqueduct\"), frontal horn of the\nlateral ventricle, and occipital horn of the lateral ventricle.[16] CSF is\nalso produced by the [single layer of column-\nshaped](/wiki/Simple_columnar_epithelium \"Simple columnar epithelium\")\n[ependymal cells](/wiki/Ependymal_cell \"Ependymal cell\") which line the\nventricles; by the lining surrounding the [subarachnoid\nspace](/wiki/Subarachnoid_space \"Subarachnoid space\"); and a small amount\ndirectly from the [tiny spaces surrounding blood\nvessels](/wiki/Perivascular_space \"Perivascular space\") around the brain.[2]\n\nCSF is produced by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form\nof [plasma](/wiki/Blood_plasma \"Blood plasma\") moves from [fenestrated\ncapillaries](/wiki/Capillary#Fenestrated \"Capillary\") in the choroid plexus\ninto an interstitial space,[1] with movement guided by a difference in\npressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid.[3]\nThis fluid then needs to pass through the [epithelium](/wiki/Epithelium\n\"Epithelium\") cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active\nprocess requiring the transport of [sodium](/wiki/Sodium \"Sodium\"),\n[potassium](/wiki/Potassium \"Potassium\") and [chloride](/wiki/Chloride\n\"Chloride\") that draws water into CSF by creating [osmotic\npressure](/wiki/Osmotic_pressure \"Osmotic pressure\").[3] Unlike blood passing\nfrom the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the\nchoroid plexus contain [tight junctions](/wiki/Tight_junctions \"Tight\njunctions\") between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely\ninto CSF.[17]\n\n[Water](/wiki/Water \"Water\") and [carbon dioxide](/wiki/Carbon_dioxide \"Carbon\ndioxide\") from the interstitial fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells.\nWithin these cells, [carbonic anhydrase](/wiki/Carbonic_anhydrase \"Carbonic\nanhydrase\") converts the substances into [bicarbonate](/wiki/Bicarbonate\n\"Bicarbonate\") and [hydrogen ions](/wiki/Hydrogen_ions \"Hydrogen ions\"). These\nare exchanged for [sodium](/wiki/Sodium \"Sodium\") and\n[chloride](/wiki/Chloride \"Chloride\") on the cell surface facing the\ninterstitium.[3] Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively\nsecreted into the ventricular lumen.[2][3] This creates [osmotic\npressure](/wiki/Osmotic_pressure \"Osmotic pressure\") and draws water into\nCSF,[2] facilitated by [aquaporins](/wiki/Aquaporin \"Aquaporin\").[3]\n[Chloride](/wiki/Chloride \"Chloride\"), with a negative charge, moves with the\npositively charged sodium, to maintain\n[electroneutrality](/wiki/Pauling%27s_principle_of_electroneutrality\n\"Pauling's principle of electroneutrality\").[2] Potassium and bicarbonate are\nalso transported out of CSF.[2] As a result, CSF contains a higher\nconcentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium,\ncalcium and glucose and protein.[5] Choroid plexuses also secrete growth\nfactors, [vitamins B1](/wiki/Vitamin_B1 \"Vitamin B1\"), [12](/wiki/Vitamin_B12\n\"Vitamin B12\") [C](/wiki/Vitamin_C \"Vitamin C\"), [folate](/wiki/Folate\n\"Folate\"), [beta-2 microglobulin](/wiki/Beta-2_microglobulin \"Beta-2\nmicroglobulin\"), [arginine vasopressin](/wiki/Arginine_vasopressin \"Arginine\nvasopressin\") and [nitrous oxide](/wiki/Nitrous_oxide \"Nitrous oxide\") into\nCSF.[3] A [Na-K-Cl cotransporter](/wiki/Na-K-Cl_cotransporter \"Na-K-Cl\ncotransporter\") and [Na/K ATPase](/wiki/Na/K_ATPase \"Na/K ATPase\") found on\nthe surface of the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating\nCSF secretion and composition.[3][1]\n\nOrešković and Klarica hypothesise that CSF is not primarily produced by the\nchoroid plexus, but is being permanently produced inside the entire CSF\nsystem, as a consequence of water filtration through the capillary walls into\nthe interstitial fluid of the surrounding brain tissue, regulated by\n[AQP-4](/wiki/Aquaporin_4 \"Aquaporin 4\").[4]\n\nThere are circadian variations in CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully\nunderstood, but potentially relating to differences in the activation of the\n[autonomic nervous system](/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system \"Autonomic nervous\nsystem\") over the course of the day.[3]\n\nChoroid plexus of the lateral ventricle produces CSF from the arterial blood\nprovided by the [choroidal arteries](/wiki/Choroidal_artery_\\(disambiguation\\)\n\"Choroidal artery \\(disambiguation\\)\").[18] In the fourth ventricle, CSF is\nproduced from the artierial blood from the [anterior inferior cerebellar\nartery](/wiki/Anterior_inferior_cerebellar_artery \"Anterior inferior\ncerebellar artery\") (cerebellopontine angle and the adjacent part of the\nlateral recess), the [posterior inferior cerebellar\nartery](/wiki/Posterior_inferior_cerebellar_artery \"Posterior inferior\ncerebellar artery\") (roof and median opening), and the [superior cerebellar\nartery](/wiki/Superior_cerebellar_artery \"Superior cerebellar artery\").[19]\n\n###\nReabsorption[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Reabsorption\")]\n\nCSF returns to the vascular system by entering the [dural venous\nsinuses](/wiki/Dural_venous_sinuses \"Dural venous sinuses\") via [arachnoid\ngranulations](/wiki/Arachnoid_granulation \"Arachnoid granulation\").[2] These\nare outpouchings of the [arachnoid mater](/wiki/Arachnoid_mater \"Arachnoid\nmater\") into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-\nway drainage.[2] This occurs because of a pressure difference between the\narachnoid mater and venous sinuses.[3] CSF has also been seen to drain into\n[lymphatic](/wiki/Lymph \"Lymph\") vessels,[20] particularly those surrounding\nthe nose via drainage along the [olfactory nerve](/wiki/Olfactory_nerve\n\"Olfactory nerve\") through the [cribriform plate](/wiki/Cribriform_plate\n\"Cribriform plate\"). The pathway and extent are currently not known,[1] but\nmay involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the\n[neonate](/wiki/Neonate \"Neonate\").[3] CSF turns over at a rate of three to\nfour times a day.[2] CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the\nsheathes of [cranial](/wiki/Cranial_nerves \"Cranial nerves\") and [spinal\nnerve](/wiki/Spinal_nerve \"Spinal nerve\") sheathes, and through the\nependyma.[3]\n\n###\nRegulation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Regulation\")]\n\nThe composition and rate of CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the\ncontent and pressure of blood and CSF.[3] For example, when CSF pressure is\nhigher, there is less of a pressure difference between the capillary blood in\nchoroid plexuses and CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the\nchoroid plexus and CSF generation.[3] The [autonomic nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system \"Autonomic nervous system\") influences\nchoroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the [sympathetic nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system \"Sympathetic nervous system\")\nincreasing secretion and the [parasympathetic nervous\nsystem](/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system \"Parasympathetic nervous system\")\ndecreasing it.[3] Changes in the [pH](/wiki/PH \"PH\") of the blood can affect\nthe activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as\n[frusemide](/wiki/Frusemide \"Frusemide\"), acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter)\nhave the potential to impact membrane channels.[3]\n\n## Clinical\nsignificance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Clinical significance\")]\n\n###\nPressure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Pressure\")]\n\nCSF pressure, as measured by [lumbar puncture](/wiki/Lumbar_puncture \"Lumbar\npuncture\"), is 10–18 [cmH2O](/wiki/Centimetre_of_water \"Centimetre of water\")\n(8–15 [mmHg](/wiki/MmHg \"MmHg\") or 1.1–2 [kPa](/wiki/Kilopascal \"Kilopascal\"))\nwith the patient lying on the side and 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa)\nwith the patient sitting up.[21] In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10\n[cmH2O](/wiki/Centimetre_of_water \"Centimetre of water\") (4.4–7.3 mmHg or\n0.78–0.98 kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of\n[jugular veins](/wiki/Jugular_vein \"Jugular vein\") in the neck. When lying\ndown, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the\n[intracranial pressure](/wiki/Intracranial_pressure \"Intracranial pressure\").\n\n[Hydrocephalus](/wiki/Hydrocephalus \"Hydrocephalus\") is an abnormal\naccumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain.[22] Hydrocephalus can\noccur because of [obstruction](/wiki/Obstructive_hydrocephalus \"Obstructive\nhydrocephalus\") of the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury,\nmass, or congenital abnormality.[22][23] Hydrocephalus without obstruction\nassociated with [normal CSF pressure](/wiki/Normal_pressure_hydrocephalus\n\"Normal pressure hydrocephalus\") may also occur.[22] Symptoms can include\nproblems with [gait](/wiki/Gait \"Gait\") and\n[coordination](/wiki/Motor_coordination \"Motor coordination\"), [urinary\nincontinence](/wiki/Urinary_incontinence \"Urinary incontinence\"),\n[nausea](/wiki/Nausea \"Nausea\") and vomiting, and progressively impaired\nthinking.[23] In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as the\nbones of the skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and\ndrowsiness.[23] A [CT scan](/wiki/CT_scan \"CT scan\") or [MRI\nscan](/wiki/MRI_scan \"MRI scan\") may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral\nventricles, or causative masses or lesions,[22][23] and lumbar puncture may be\nused to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial\npressure.[24] Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a\nshunt, which diverts fluid to another part of the body, such as a [ventriculo-\nperitoneal shunt](/wiki/Ventriculo-peritoneal_shunt \"Ventriculo-peritoneal\nshunt\").[22][23]\n\n[Idiopathic intracranial\nhypertension](/wiki/Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension \"Idiopathic\nintracranial hypertension\") is a condition of unknown cause characterised by a\nrise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, [double\nvision](/wiki/Double_vision \"Double vision\"), difficulties seeing, and a\n[swollen optic disc](/wiki/Papilledema \"Papilledema\").[22] It can occur in\nassociation with the use of Vitamin A and [tetracycline](/wiki/Tetracycline\n\"Tetracycline\") antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all,\nparticularly in younger [obese](/wiki/Obese \"Obese\") women.[22] Management may\ninclude ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as\n[acetazolamide](/wiki/Acetazolamide \"Acetazolamide\"), repeated drainage via\nlumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal\nshunt.[22]\n\n### CSF\nleak[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: CSF leak\")]\n\n[CSF can leak](/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid_leak \"Cerebrospinal fluid leak\") from\nthe [dura](/wiki/Dura_mater \"Dura mater\") as a result of different causes such\nas physical trauma or a lumbar puncture, or from [no known\ncause](/wiki/Idiopathy \"Idiopathy\") when it is termed a [spontaneous\ncerebrospinal fluid leak](/wiki/Spontaneous_cerebrospinal_fluid_leak\n\"Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak\").[25] It is usually associated with\n[intracranial hypotension](/wiki/Intracranial_hypotension \"Intracranial\nhypotension\"): low CSF pressure.[24] It can cause headaches, made worse by\nstanding, moving and coughing,[24] as the low CSF pressure causes the brain to\n\"sag\" downwards and put pressure on its lower structures.[24] If a leak is\nidentified, a [beta-2 transferrin](/wiki/Beta-2_transferrin \"Beta-2\ntransferrin\") test of the leaking fluid, when positive, is highly specific and\nsensitive for the detection for CSF leakage.[25] [Medical\nimaging](/wiki/Medical_imaging \"Medical imaging\") such as CT scans and MRI\nscans can be used to investigate for a presumed CSF leak when no obvious leak\nis found but low CSF pressure is identified.[26] [Caffeine](/wiki/Caffeine\n\"Caffeine\"), given either orally or [intravenously](/wiki/Intravenous\n\"Intravenous\"), often offers symptomatic relief.[26] Treatment of an\nidentified leak may include injection of a person's blood into the epidural\nspace (an [epidural blood patch](/wiki/Epidural_blood_patch \"Epidural blood\npatch\")), [spinal surgery](/wiki/Spinal_surgery \"Spinal surgery\"), or [fibrin\nglue](/wiki/Fibrin_glue \"Fibrin glue\").[26]\n\n### Lumbar\npuncture[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Lumbar puncture\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/4_vials_of_human_cerebrospinal_fluid.jpg/220px-4_vials_of_human_cerebrospinal_fluid.jpg)](/wiki/File:4_vials_of_human_cerebrospinal_fluid.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:4_vials_of_human_cerebrospinal_fluid.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nVials containing human cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nMain article: [Lumbar puncture](/wiki/Lumbar_puncture \"Lumbar puncture\")\n\nCSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of [neurological\ndiseases](/wiki/Neurological_disease \"Neurological disease\"), usually obtained\nby a procedure called [lumbar puncture](/wiki/Lumbar_puncture \"Lumbar\npuncture\").[27] Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by\ninserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and\nfourth [lumbar vertebrae](/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae \"Lumbar vertebrae\"). CSF is\nextracted through the needle, and tested.[25] About one third of people\nexperience a headache after lumbar puncture,[25] and pain or discomfort at the\nneedle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising,\n[meningitis](/wiki/Meningitis \"Meningitis\") or ongoing post lumbar-puncture\nleakage of CSF.[1]\n\nTesting often including observing the colour of the fluid, measuring CSF\npressure, and counting and identifying [white](/wiki/White_blood_cell \"White\nblood cell\") and [red blood cells](/wiki/Red_blood_cell \"Red blood cell\")\nwithin the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and\n[culturing](/wiki/Microbiological_culture \"Microbiological culture\") the\nfluid.[25][27] The presence of red blood cells and\n[xanthochromia](/wiki/Xanthochromia \"Xanthochromia\") may indicate\n[subarachnoid hemorrhage](/wiki/Subarachnoid_hemorrhage \"Subarachnoid\nhemorrhage\"); whereas [central nervous system](/wiki/Central_nervous_system\n\"Central nervous system\") infections such as [meningitis](/wiki/Meningitis\n\"Meningitis\"), may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels.[27] A CSF\nculture may yield the [microorganism](/wiki/Microorganism \"Microorganism\")\nthat has caused the infection,[25] or [PCR](/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction\n\"Polymerase chain reaction\") may be used to identify a viral cause.[27]\nInvestigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to\nspecific diseases, including [multiple sclerosis](/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis\n\"Multiple sclerosis\"), [paraneoplastic\nsyndromes](/wiki/Paraneoplastic_syndrome \"Paraneoplastic syndrome\"), [systemic\nlupus erythematosus](/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus \"Systemic lupus\nerythematosus\"), [neurosarcoidosis](/wiki/Neurosarcoidosis\n\"Neurosarcoidosis\"), [cerebral angiitis](/wiki/Cerebral_angiitis \"Cerebral\nangiitis\");[1] and specific [antibodies](/wiki/Antibodies \"Antibodies\") such\nas [Aquaporin 4](/wiki/Aquaporin_4 \"Aquaporin 4\") may be tested for to assist\nin the diagnosis of [autoimmune](/wiki/Autoimmune \"Autoimmune\") conditions.[1]\nA lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for\nsome conditions, including [idiopathic intracranial\nhypertension](/wiki/Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension \"Idiopathic\nintracranial hypertension\") and [normal pressure\nhydrocephalus](/wiki/Normal_pressure_hydrocephalus \"Normal pressure\nhydrocephalus\").[1]\n\nLumbar puncture can also be performed to measure the [intracranial\npressure](/wiki/Intracranial_pressure \"Intracranial pressure\"), which might be\nincreased in certain types of [hydrocephalus](/wiki/Hydrocephalus\n\"Hydrocephalus\"). However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if\nincreased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as\na tumour, because it can lead to fatal [brain\nherniation](/wiki/Brain_herniation \"Brain herniation\").[25]\n\n### Anaesthesia and\nchemotherapy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Anaesthesia and chemotherapy\")]\n\nSee also: [Blood–cerebrospinal fluid\nbarrier](/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93cerebrospinal_fluid_barrier \"Blood–cerebrospinal\nfluid barrier\")\n\nSome [anaesthetics](/wiki/Anesthetic \"Anesthetic\") and\n[chemotherapy](/wiki/Chemotherapy \"Chemotherapy\") are injected\n[intrathecally](/wiki/Intrathecal \"Intrathecal\") into the subarachnoid space,\nwhere they spread around CSF, meaning substances that cannot cross the [blood-\nbrain barrier](/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier \"Blood-brain barrier\") can still be\nactive throughout the central nervous system.[28][29]\n[Baricity](/wiki/Baricity \"Baricity\") refers to the density of a substance\ncompared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid and is used in [general\nanesthesia](/wiki/General_anesthesia \"General anesthesia\") to determine the\nmanner in which a particular drug will spread in the\n[intrathecal](/wiki/Intrathecal \"Intrathecal\") space.[28]\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nVarious comments by ancient physicians have been read as referring to CSF.\n[Hippocrates](/wiki/Hippocrates \"Hippocrates\") discussed \"water\" surrounding\nthe brain when describing congenital [hydrocephalus](/wiki/Hydrocephalus\n\"Hydrocephalus\"), and [Galen](/wiki/Galen \"Galen\") referred to \"excremental\nliquid\" in the ventricles of the brain, which he believed was purged into the\nnose. But for some 16 intervening centuries of ongoing anatomical study, CSF\nremained unmentioned in the literature. This is perhaps because of the\nprevailing autopsy technique, which involved cutting off the head, thereby\nremoving evidence of CSF before the brain was examined.[30]\n\nThe modern rediscovery of CSF is now credited to [Emanuel\nSwedenborg](/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg \"Emanuel Swedenborg\"). In a manuscript\nwritten between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg\nreferred to CSF as \"spirituous lymph\" secreted from the roof of the fourth\nventricle down to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. This manuscript was\neventually published in translation in 1887.[30]\n\n[Albrecht von Haller](/wiki/Albrecht_von_Haller \"Albrecht von Haller\"), a\nSwiss physician and physiologist, made note in his 1747 book on physiology\nthat the \"water\" in the brain was secreted into the ventricles and absorbed in\nthe veins, and when secreted in excess, could lead to hydrocephalus.[30]\n[Francois Magendie](/wiki/Francois_Magendie \"Francois Magendie\") studied the\nproperties of CSF by vivisection. He discovered the foramen Magendie, the\nopening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, but mistakenly believed that CSF\nwas secreted by the [pia mater](/wiki/Pia_mater \"Pia mater\").[30]\n\n[Thomas Willis](/wiki/Thomas_Willis \"Thomas Willis\") (noted as the discoverer\nof the [circle of Willis](/wiki/Circle_of_Willis \"Circle of Willis\")) made\nnote of the fact that the consistency of CSF is altered in meningitis.[30] In\n1869 [Gustav Schwalbe](/wiki/Gustav_Schwalbe \"Gustav Schwalbe\") proposed that\nCSF drainage could occur via lymphatic vessels.[1]\n\nIn 1891, [W. Essex Wynter](/wiki/W._Essex_Wynter \"W. Essex Wynter\") began\ntreating tubercular meningitis by tapping the subarachnoid space, and\n[Heinrich Quincke](/wiki/Heinrich_Quincke \"Heinrich Quincke\") began to\npopularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and\ntherapeutic purposes.[30] In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the\nfirst accurate description of the chemical composition of CSF.[30] In 1914,\n[Harvey W. Cushing](/wiki/Harvey_W._Cushing \"Harvey W. Cushing\") published\nconclusive evidence that CSF is secreted by the [choroid\nplexus](/wiki/Choroid_plexus \"Choroid plexus\").[30]\n\n## Other\nanimals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Other animals\")]\n\nDuring [phylogenesis](/wiki/Phylogenesis \"Phylogenesis\"), CSF is present\nwithin the [neuraxis](/wiki/Neuraxis \"Neuraxis\") before it circulates.[3] The\nCSF of [Teleostei](/wiki/Teleostei \"Teleostei\") fish is contained within the\nventricles of the brains, but not in a nonexistent subarachnoid space.[3] In\nmammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, CSF is present in it.[3]\nAbsorption of CSF is seen in [amniotes](/wiki/Amniote \"Amniote\") and more\ncomplex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system\nof absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal\nepidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller\nrole.[3]\n\nThe amount of cerebrospinal fluid varies by size and species.[31] In humans\nand other [mammals](/wiki/Mammal \"Mammal\"), cerebrospinal fluid, produced,\ncirculating, and reabsorbed in a similar manner to humans, and with a similar\nfunction, turns over at a rate of 3–5 times a day.[31] Problems with CSF\ncirculation leading to hydrocephalus occur in other animals.[31]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Craniosacral therapy](/wiki/Craniosacral_therapy \"Craniosacral therapy\")\n  * [Neuroglobin](/wiki/Neuroglobin \"Neuroglobin\")\n  * [Pandy's test](/wiki/Pandy%27s_test \"Pandy's test\")\n  * [Reissner's fiber](/wiki/Reissner%27s_fiber \"Reissner's fiber\")\n  * [Syrinx (medicine)](/wiki/Syrinx_\\(medicine\\) \"Syrinx \\(medicine\\)\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cerebrospinal_fluid&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ _**h**_ _**i**_ _**j**_ _**k**_ _**l**_ _**m**_ _**n**_ _**o**_ _**p**_ _**q**_ _**r**_ Wright, Ben L.
