The brothers' history and the town's mythology are\nrevealed through flashbacks as the series goes on.\n\nAdditional storylines revolve around the other inhabitants of the town, most\nnotably Elena's younger brother [Jeremy Gilbert](/wiki/Jeremy_Gilbert \"Jeremy\nGilbert\") ([Steven R.

He marries Caroline in Season 8 and is killed afterwards in the series finale as he sacrifices himself for Mystic Falls.

They begin dating in season 4, and continue to date (with some breakups along the way) until Elena is put into her deep sleep at the end of season 6.

However, at the urging\nof [Julie Plec](/wiki/Julie_Plec \"Julie Plec\"), he began to read the novels\nand started to become intrigued by the story: \"I began to realize that it was\na story about a small town, about that town's underbelly and about what lurks\nunder the surface.\"[23] Williamson has stated the town's story will be the\nmain focus of the series rather than high school.[24]\n\nOn February 6, 2009, _Variety_ announced that The CW had green-lit the pilot\nfor _The Vampire Diaries_ with Williamson and Julie Plec set as the head\nwriters and executive producers.[25] On May 19, 2009, the series was\nofficially ordered for the 2009–2010 season.[26]\n\nThe pilot episode was filmed in [Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver \"Vancouver\"),\n[British Columbia](/wiki/British_Columbia \"British Columbia\"), but the rest of\nthe episodes have been filmed in [Covington, Georgia](/wiki/Covington,_Georgia\n\"Covington, Georgia\") (which doubles as the show's fictional small town of\nMystic Falls, [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\")) and various other\ncommunities around [Greater Atlanta](/wiki/Atlanta_metropolitan_area \"Atlanta\nmetropolitan area\")[27] to take advantage of local tax incentives. On the\nmorning of May 10, 2012, a fire broke out in the building on Clark Street in\nCovington that was used as the setting for Mystic Grill on the show.[28]\n\nThe series was given a full 22-episode order on October 21, 2009, after strong\nratings for the first half of the season. Now there is a spin-off called _[The\nOriginals](/wiki/The_Originals_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Originals \\(TV series\\)\")_ ,\nthat goes into depth about the original vampire family from _The Vampire\nDiaries_.[29] On February 16, 2010, The CW announced that it had renewed the\nshow for a second season,[30] which premiered on September 9, 2010.[31] On\nApril 26, 2011, The CW renewed the show for a third season.[32] The third\nseason premiered on September 15, 2011.[33] The fourth season premiered\nOctober 11, 2012.
