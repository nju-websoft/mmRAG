        "# Philistine captivity of the Ark\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/DuraSyn-\nWB4-Ark_and_Temple_of_Dagon.jpg/300px-DuraSyn-\nWB4-Ark_and_Temple_of_Dagon.jpg)](/wiki/File:DuraSyn-\nWB4-Ark_and_Temple_of_Dagon.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:DuraSyn-WB4-Ark_and_Temple_of_Dagon.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Fresco](/wiki/Fresco \"Fresco\") of the Philistine captivity of the ark, in the\n[Dura-Europos synagogue](/wiki/Dura-Europos_synagogue \"Dura-Europos\nsynagogue\").\n\nThe **Philistine captivity of the Ark** was an episode described in the\nbiblical history of the [Israelites](/wiki/Israelite \"Israelite\"), in which\nthe [Ark of the covenant](/wiki/Ark_of_the_covenant \"Ark of the covenant\") was\nin the possession of the [Philistines](/wiki/Philistines \"Philistines\"), who\nhad captured it after defeating the Israelites in a battle at a location\nbetween [Eben-ezer](/wiki/Eben-ezer \"Eben-ezer\"), where the Israelites\nencamped, and [Aphek](/wiki/Aphek_\\(biblical\\) \"Aphek \\(biblical\\)\") (probably\n[Antipatris](/wiki/Antipatris \"Antipatris\")), where the Philistines encamped.\n\nThe ark narrative does not include any mention of\n[Samuel](/wiki/Samuel_\\(Biblical_figure\\) \"Samuel \\(Biblical figure\\)\"); Bill\nArnold suggests that it is \"in order to celebrate the power of Yahweh's\nark.\"[1] Many scholars put 1 Samuel 4 - 6 together with 2 Samuel 6 and believe\nthat it reflects an old source that was eventually incorporated into the\nHistory of David's Rise or into the later [Deuteronomistic\nHistory](/wiki/Deuteronomist \"Deuteronomist\").[2]\n\nAccording to [1 Samuel](/wiki/Books_of_Samuel \"Books of Samuel\") 4, prior to\nthe battle the Ark had been residing at the ancient sanctuary of\n[Shiloh](/wiki/Shiloh_\\(Biblical_city\\) \"Shiloh \\(Biblical city\\)\"), but was\nbrought out by the Israelites in hope of victory in the war. The Israelites\nsuffered a significant defeat; [Hophni and Phinehas](/wiki/Hophni_and_Phinehas\n\"Hophni and Phinehas\"), sons of the [High Priest](/wiki/Kohen_Gadol \"Kohen\nGadol\") [Eli](/wiki/Eli_\\(Bible\\) \"Eli \\(Bible\\)\"), were killed and the ark\nwas captured. The news of the ark's capture was such a shock to Eli that he\nfell off his chair and died, while [Phinehas' wife](/wiki/Wife_of_Phinehas\n\"Wife of Phinehas\") died in childbirth as she heard the news, giving birth to\n[Ichabod](/wiki/Ichabod \"Ichabod\"), whose name means \"Where is the glory?\"\n[Robert Alter](/wiki/Robert_Alter \"Robert Alter\") argues that 1 Samuel 4:22\nshould be translated as \"Glory is _exiled_ from Israel,\" and that the story of\nthe Philistine captivity of the ark is one of [exile](/wiki/Exile \"Exile\").[3]\n[Peter Leithart](/wiki/Peter_Leithart \"Peter Leithart\") suggests that Israel\ndeserved to go into exile, but the ark did so instead: \"Yahweh went into\nexile, taking on the curse of the covenant for His people, and while in exile\nHe fought for them and defeated the gods of Philistia.\"[4]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/The_plague_of_ashdod_1630.jpg/300px-\nThe_plague_of_ashdod_1630.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_plague_of_ashdod_1630.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_plague_of_ashdod_1630.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Nicolas Poussin](/wiki/Nicolas_Poussin \"Nicolas Poussin\"), _The Plague of\nAshdod_.\n\n1 Samuel 5 and 6 describe the Philistines as having to move the Ark to several\nparts of their territory, as tumours or [hemorrhoids](/wiki/Hemorrhoids\n\"Hemorrhoids\") (\"emerods\") afflicted the people in each town to which it was\ntaken: [Ashdod](/wiki/Ashdod \"Ashdod\"), then [Gath](/wiki/Gath_\\(city\\) \"Gath\n\\(city\\)\"), then [Ekron](/wiki/Ekron \"Ekron\"). The\n[Septuagint](/wiki/Septuagint \"Septuagint\") adds that \"[mice](/wiki/Mouse\n\"Mouse\") sprang up in the midst of their country\".[5] Stirrup points out that\nthe \"severity of the punishments increases through the passage\": tumours in\nAshdod (vv. 6-8), extensive tumours and panic in Gath, which had volunteered\nto take on the Ark (vv. 9,10a), and tumours on those who did not die and\ndeathly panic in Ekron, which was 'volunteered' to take the Ark (vv.\n10b-12).[6] The text explicitly ascribes the plague to \"[Yahweh](/wiki/Yahweh\n\"Yahweh\")'s hand\" (1 Samuel 5:6).\n\nIn Ashdod, when the Ark was placed in the temple of [Dagon](/wiki/Dagon\n\"Dagon\"), the statue of Dagon was found [prostrate](/wiki/Prostration\n\"Prostration\") in front of the Ark the next morning; after the statue of Dagon\nwas restored to its place, it was again found prostrate the next morning, and\nthis time its head and hands had also been broken off.\n\nLeithart provides a number of parallels between the Philistine captivity of\nthe Ark and the [Plagues of Egypt](/wiki/Plagues_of_Egypt \"Plagues of Egypt\")\nin the [Book of Exodus](/wiki/Book_of_Exodus \"Book of Exodus\"). The ark brings\nabout plagues, humbles the gods of the Philistines and returns full of\ntreasure.[7] In fact, the Philistine diviners refer to the events of the\n[Exodus](/wiki/The_Exodus \"The Exodus\") in 1 Samuel 6:6. On the advice of\nthese [diviners](/wiki/Divination \"Divination\") about how to end the plagues,\nthe Philistines made a guilt offering of five golden tumors and five gold mice\n(representing the five Philistine rulers). They then placed the gold along\nwith the ark on a cart drawn by two milch cows, who head straight for Israel\nand do not waver. The ark stops at [Beth Shemesh](/wiki/Beit_Shemesh \"Beit\nShemesh\") before finding a more permanent home at [Kiriath-\nJearim](/wiki/Kiriath-Jearim \"Kiriath-Jearim\").\n\n  \n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Philistine_captivity_of_the_Ark&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Bill T.
