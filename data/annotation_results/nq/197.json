Sepinwall stated: \"I'd like to say that season 2 of _The\nKilling_ was an improvement on season 1, and in some ways, it probably was.\nThe second season certainly did a better job of doing what Veena Sud claimed\nto be doing last year, in that it took advantage of the extra time to sketch\nin some of the characters... I honestly feel like any kinder feelings I have\nfor the second season came from the complete lack of investment I had in\nit.\"[46] Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the finale 4.7 out of 5 stars, but,\nupon first viewing, \"wasn't sure what to feel. I wasn't elated. I wasn't\nexcited\" but after watching it again was \"sucked into the world, mesmerized\nnot by the victory of our hero cops... but by the gut-wrenching moments that\nunfolded.\"[47] [CraveOnline](/wiki/CraveOnline \"CraveOnline\")'s William\nBibbiani called the finale \"an odd duck.\" After citing Jamie's early\nrevelation as \"melodramatic silliness,\" Bibbiani added: \"The rest of the\nepisode gets its job done, with one major, glaring flaw. The characters end up\nmore or less where they need to be, but some nearly ridiculous loose ends\nremain.\"[48] Brandon Nowalk of _[The A.V. Club](/wiki/The_A.V._Club \"The A.V.\nClub\")_ rated this finale a C-, calling it \"so unconvincing,\" adding \"I\ncouldn't believe how little all this resolution affected me after _The\nKilling_ so thrillingly took my grudging engagement for a ride a few weeks\nago. This is the same show that delivered Richmond’s hospital nightmare, the\nhunt for Holder, the anti-Western standoff \"[Sayonara,\nHiawatha](/wiki/Sayonara,_Hiawatha \"Sayonara, Hiawatha\"),\" and the crazy train\nof the last two weeks? No, this is the full-circle episode, the one that takes\nthe show back to its roots.
