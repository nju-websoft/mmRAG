It\nwas a new denomination with [mauve](/wiki/Mauve \"Mauve\") colouration – the\npound system had no £2½ note.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Series\n  * 2 Statistics\n  * 3 Design\n  * 4 Security features\n  * 5 Other issues\n  * 6 References\n\n## Series[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Australian_five-\ndollar_note&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Series\")]\n\nThere have been a number of different issues of this denomination, including:\n\n  * The first issue was a paper note which had a gradient of mauve, with a distinct black overprint. It was designed by Gordon Andrews, with [Russell Drysdale](/wiki/Russell_Drysdale \"Russell Drysdale\") as the [Reserve Bank of Australia](/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia \"Reserve Bank of Australia\")’s artistic advisor. It featured portraits of [Sir Joseph Banks](/wiki/Sir_Joseph_Banks \"Sir Joseph Banks\") and [Caroline Chisholm](/wiki/Caroline_Chisholm \"Caroline Chisholm\"), as well as elevations of Sydney streets from [Joseph Fowles](/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Fowles&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Joseph Fowles \\(page does not exist\\)\")’ \"Sydney in 1848\", the cover of the Shipping Gazette, a watercolour of the Waverley, and a handbill of a meeting of the Family Colonization Loan Society. All of these images were sourced from the [State Library of New South Wales](/wiki/State_Library_of_New_South_Wales \"State Library of New South Wales\").\n  * The first [Polymer banknote](/wiki/Polymer_banknote \"Polymer banknote\") issue, which can be recognised for its distinct mauve colouration and numeral font, was first issued in pale mauve in 1992. A number of people found it difficult to distinguish it from the $10 banknote, especially in poor lighting conditions.\n  * In 1995, a second polymer issue was issues, distinguishable by its deeper shade of mauve and a different font for the numeral.\n  * A federation commemorative was issued in 2001 for that year only. Notes featured Sir Henry Parkes on the obverse and Catherine Helen Spence on the reverse.\n  * On 1 September 2016 the Next Generation Banknote (NGB) $5 was issued. The NGB series banknotes contain more security features than the previous series, including a clear top-to-bottom window and a 3D tactile feature to assist the vision impaired.\n\n## Statistics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Australian_five-\ndollar_note&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Statistics\")]\n\nAccording to Reserve Bank statistics, at the end of June 2017 there were 211\nmillion $5 banknotes in circulation, 14% of the total banknotes in\ncirculation; worth $1,055 million, or 1% of the total value for all\ndenominations.[2]\n\nLeek has the greatest value, issued for two years only; and the 1990\nFraser/Higgens being issued for less than a year.[_[clarification\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_]\n\nFrom 1967 to 1974, the title identifying the country was \"[Commonwealth of\nAustralia](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia \"Commonwealth of Australia\")\" and\nthere were 195,504,000 of these notes issued. The title identifying the\ncountry was then changed to \"Australia\" and from 1974 until the end of the\nissuance of paper currency for this denomination (in 1992), 978,068,318 of\nthese notes were issued.\n\n## Design[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Australian_five-\ndollar_note&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Design\")]\n\nOn the 1995 design, Queen Elizabeth II is on the obverse, along with\neucalyptus leaves. There is a number 5 in the right hand corner of both sides.\nThe word \"Australia\" is written to the left of the Queen. Parliament house\nappears on the reverse. On the 2001 commemorative design, Sir Henry Parkes\nappears on the obverse and Catherine Helen Spence on the reverse.\n\nOn 12 April 2016, the Reserve Bank of Australia announced a new design for the\n5-dollar banknote would be introduced into circulation on 1 September 2016. It\nis the first of a new series of banknotes that will feature a different\nspecies of Australian wattle and a native bird. The 5-dollar banknote has the\nPrickly Moses wattle and the Eastern Spinebill.[3][4][5]\n\n## Security features[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Australian_five-\ndollar_note&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Security features\")]\n\nThe paper design included a watermark of Captain James Cook in the white\nfield. The same watermark was also used in the last issue of pound banknotes.\nA new feature of the decimal currency was metallic strip embedded within the\npaper of the note, first near the centre of the note, then from 1976 moved to\nthe left side on the obverse of the note.\n\nThe [polymer](/wiki/Polymer \"Polymer\") issue includes: a shadow image of the\n[Australian coat of arms](/wiki/Australian_coat_of_arms \"Australian coat of\narms\") which is visible under other printing when the note is held up to\nlight; a pointed star with four points on the obverse and three on the reverse\nthat come together under light; a clear window that has a stylised gum flower\nshowing; and raised print and micro printing of the denomination value.[6]\n\nSome features of the banknote glow under UV light. These features include the\nserial number and a square patch on the reverse of the note. There is also\nraised printing around the portraits and major design elements of the note\nwhich can be felt by rubbing the finger or fingernail against them.[7]\n\n## Other issues[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Australian_five-\ndollar_note&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Other issues\")]\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Australian_%245_note_paper_front.jpg/120px-Australian_%245_note_paper_front.jpg)](/wiki/File:Australian_$5_note_paper_front.jpg)\n\n1967 paper note obverse featuring [Joseph Banks](/wiki/Joseph_Banks \"Joseph\nBanks\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Australian_%245_note_paper_back.jpg/120px-Australian_%245_note_paper_back.jpg)](/wiki/File:Australian_$5_note_paper_back.jpg)\n\n1967 paper note reverse featuring [Caroline Chisholm](/wiki/Caroline_Chisholm\n\"Caroline Chisholm\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e8/Australian_5note_front_%28new%29.jpg/120px-Australian_5note_front_%28new%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Australian_5note_front_\\(new\\).jpg)\n\n2001 commemorative \"Federation\" note obverse featuring [Henry\nParkes](/wiki/Henry_Parkes \"Henry Parkes\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bd/Australian_5note_back_%28new%29.jpg/120px-Australian_5note_back_%28new%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Australian_5note_back_\\(new\\).jpg)\n\n2001 commemorative \"Federation\" note featuring [Catherine Helen\nSpence](/wiki/Catherine_Helen_Spence \"Catherine Helen Spence\")\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Australian_%245_polymer_front.jpg/120px-Australian_%245_polymer_front.jpg)](/wiki/File:Australian_$5_polymer_front.jpg)\n\nObverse design from 1992 to 2016\n\n  * [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/36/Australian_%245_polymer_back.jpg/120px-Australian_%245_polymer_back.jpg)](/wiki/File:Australian_$5_polymer_back.jpg)\n\nReverse design from 1992 to 2016\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Australian_five-\ndollar_note&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** <http://banknotes.rba.gov.au/resources/for-collectors/serial-numbers/>\n  2. **Jump up ^** [DISTRIBUTION-CIRCULATION AND PRODUCTION STATISTICS, AS AT END JUNE 2017\". banknotes.rba.gov.au.
