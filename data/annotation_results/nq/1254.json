In many English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon\nused for serving,[1] however, in some regions, including parts of Canada, it\nis the largest type of spoon used for eating. By extension, the term is used\nas a [measure](/wiki/Unit_of_measurement \"Unit of measurement\") of\n[volume](/wiki/Volume \"Volume\") in\n[cooking](/wiki/Cooking_weights_and_measures \"Cooking weights and measures\").\nIn this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated _tbsp_ or _T,_ and\noccasionally referred to as a _tablespoonful_ to distinguish it from the\nutensil. The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States tablespoon\nis approximately 14.8 [ml](/wiki/Millilitre \"Millilitre\") (0.50 [US fl\noz](/wiki/US_fluid_ounce \"US fluid ounce\")), a United Kingdom and Canadian\ntablespoon is exactly 15 ml (0.51 US fl oz),[2] and an Australian tablespoon\nis 20 ml (0.68 US fl oz).[3] The capacity of the utensil (as opposed to the\nmeasurement) is not defined by law or custom and bears no particular relation\nto the measurement.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Variants\n    * 2.1 Relationship to teaspoon and fluid ounce\n    * 2.2 Traditional definitions\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tablespoon&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nBefore about 1700, it was customary for Europeans to bring their own spoons to\nthe table. Spoons were carried as personal property in much the same way as\npeople today carry wallets, key rings, etc. From about 1700 the [place\nsetting](/wiki/Place_setting \"Place setting\") became popular, and with it the\n\"table-spoon\", \"table-fork\" and \"table-knife\". Around the same time the [tea-\nspoon](/wiki/Teaspoon \"Teaspoon\") and [dessert-spoon](/wiki/Dessert_spoon\n\"Dessert spoon\") first appeared, and the table-spoon was reserved for eating\n[soup](/wiki/Soup \"Soup\").[4] The 18th century witnessed a proliferation of\ndifferent sorts of spoons, including the mustard-spoon, salt-spoon, coffee-\nspoon, and soup-spoon. In the late 19th century UK, the dessert-spoon and\nsoup-spoon began to displace the table-spoon as the primary implement for\neating from a bowl, at which point the name \"table-spoon\" took on a secondary\nmeaning as a much larger [serving spoon](/wiki/Serving_spoon \"Serving\nspoon\").[5] At the time the first edition of the [Oxford English\nDictionary](/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary \"Oxford English Dictionary\") was\npublished in 1928, \"tablespoon\" (which by then was no longer hyphenated) still\nhad two definitions in the UK: the original definition (eating spoon) and the\nnew definition (serving spoon).\n\nIn the 18th century, the table-spoon became an unofficial unit of the\n[Apothecaries' system](/wiki/Apothecaries%27_system \"Apothecaries' system\") of\nmeasures, equal to 4 drams or ​1⁄2 fl oz. It was more commonly known by the\nLatin **cochleare majus** (abbreviated **cochl. maj.**) or, in Apothecaries'\nnotation, **f℥ss** or **f℥ß**.[6][7][8]\n\n## Variants[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tablespoon&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Variants\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/MeasuringSpoons.jpg/220px-\nMeasuringSpoons.jpg)](/wiki/File:MeasuringSpoons.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MeasuringSpoons.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMeasuring spoons\n\nMain article: [Dry measure](/wiki/Dry_measure \"Dry measure\")\n\nA _level tablespoon_ , the usual meaning without further qualification, is\nmeasured by filling the spoon and scraping it level. In contrast, a _heaped_ ,\n_heaping_ , or _rounded_ spoonful is not leveled off, and includes a heap\nabove the spoon. The exact volume of a heaped tablespoon depends somewhat on\nthe shape and curvature of the measuring spoon being used, and so is not a\nprecise unit of measurement.\n\nCommon tablespoons intended for use as [cutlery](/wiki/Cutlery \"Cutlery\")\n(called [dessert spoons](/wiki/Dessert_spoon \"Dessert spoon\") in the UK, where\na tablespoon is always a serving spoon) usually hold 7–14 ml (0.24–0.47 US fl\noz),[9] considerably less than some tablespoons used for serving.\n\n### Relationship to teaspoon and fluid\nounce[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tablespoon&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Relationship to teaspoon and fluid ounce\")]\n\nIn most regions (including the US, UK, most [Commonwealth\ncountries](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations \"Commonwealth of Nations\"), East Asia\nand the Philippines), one tablespoon equals three [teaspoons](/wiki/Teaspoon\n\"Teaspoon\"). In many of these regions, one tablespoon is 14.8 ml (0.50 US fl\noz). In South Africa, one tablespoon is 15 ml. In some places like the US, the\ntablespoon was historically defined as ​1⁄2 US fl oz (2 tbsp. = 1 US fl oz).\nIn Australia, a tablespoon is defined as four teaspoons, equaling to 20 ml\n(0.68 US fl oz). Victorian and Edwardian era tablespoons used in the UK are\noften 25 ml (0.85 US fl oz) or sometimes larger. They are used only for\npreparing and serving food, not as part of a place-setting.\n\nIn writing volume-based recipes, an abbreviation like **tbsp.** is usually\nused to refer to a tablespoon, to differentiate it from the smaller teaspoon\n(**tsp.**). Some authors additionally capitalize the abbreviation, as\n**Tbsp.** , while leaving **tsp.** in lower case, to emphasize that the larger\ntablespoon, rather than the smaller teaspoon, is wanted. The tablespoon\nabbreviation is sometimes further abbreviated to \"Tb.\" or **T**.\n\n### Traditional\ndefinitions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tablespoon&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Traditional definitions\")]\n\nThe traditional US interpretation of the tablespoon as a unit of volume\nis:[10]\n\n    \n\n     1 US tablespoon | = 4 [fluid drams](/wiki/Dram_\\(unit\\) \"Dram \\(unit\\)\")  \n---|---  \n| = 3 [teaspoons](/wiki/Teaspoon \"Teaspoon\")  \n| = ​1⁄2 US fluid ounce  \n| = ​1⁄3 US [shot](/wiki/Shot_glass#Sizes \"Shot glass\")  \n| = ​1⁄8 [US gill](/wiki/Gill_\\(unit\\) \"Gill \\(unit\\)\")  \n| = ​1⁄16 [US cup](/wiki/Cup_\\(unit\\)#United_States \"Cup \\(unit\\)\")  \n| ≈ 14.8 ml[11]  \n  \nIn nutrition labeling in the US and the UK, a tablespoon is defined as 15 ml\n(0.51 US fl oz).[12] A metric tablespoon is exactly equal to 15\n[cm3](/wiki/Cubic_centimetre \"Cubic centimetre\") (0.92 [cu\nin](/wiki/Cubic_inch \"Cubic inch\")).[13]\n\nThe Australian definition of the tablespoon as a unit of volume is:\n\n    \n\n     1 Australian tablespoon | = 20 ml   \n---|---  \n| ≈ ​2⁄3 fl. oz.  \n| = 2 [dessertspoons](/wiki/Dessertspoon \"Dessertspoon\")  \n| = 4 [teaspoons](/wiki/Teaspoon \"Teaspoon\")  \n  \n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tablespoon&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Dessert spoon](/wiki/Dessert_spoon \"Dessert spoon\")\n  * [Teaspoon](/wiki/Teaspoon \"Teaspoon\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tablespoon&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [The Oxford English Dictionary Third edition, December 2008, entry at tablespoon](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/196806)(subscription required)\n  2. **Jump up ^** [\"How Many Tablespoons in a Cup - Easy Conversions\"](http://www.firsthealthmag.com/how-many-tablespoons-in-a-cup-easy-conversions/). _First Health Mag_.
