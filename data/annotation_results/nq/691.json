The\ncause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element\n[earth](/wiki/Earth_\\(classical_element\\) \"Earth \\(classical element\\)\"), was\nrelated to their [nature](/wiki/Nature_\\(philosophy\\) \"Nature\n\\(philosophy\\)\"), which caused them to move downward toward the center of the\nuniverse, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the\nelement [fire](/wiki/Fire_\\(classical_element\\) \"Fire \\(classical element\\)\"),\nmove by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the\n[sphere](/wiki/Celestial_spheres \"Celestial spheres\") of the Moon. Thus in\nAristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the Earth by an external\nforce of gravity, but tend toward the center of the universe because of an\ninner _gravitas_ or heaviness.[1][2]\n\nIn Book VII of his _[De Architectura](/wiki/De_Architectura \"De\nArchitectura\")_ , the Roman engineer and architect [Vitruvius](/wiki/Vitruvius\n\"Vitruvius\") contends that gravity is not dependent on a substance's \"weight\"\nbut rather on its \"nature\" (cf. [specific gravity](/wiki/Specific_gravity\n\"Specific gravity\")).\n\n> If the [quicksilver](/wiki/Mercury_\\(element\\) \"Mercury \\(element\\)\") is\n> poured into a vessel, and a stone weighing one hundred pounds is laid upon\n> it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot depress the liquid, nor break\n> through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, and put on\n> a scruple of gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own\n> accord. Hence, it is undeniable that the gravity of a substance depends not\n> on the amount of its weight, but on its nature.[3]\n\n###\nIndia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_gravitational_theory&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: India\")]\n\n[Aryabhata](/wiki/Aryabhata \"Aryabhata\") first identified the force to explain\nwhy objects do not fall when the Earth rotates, and developed a\n[geocentric](/wiki/Geocentric \"Geocentric\") solar system of\n[gravitation](/wiki/Gravitation \"Gravitation\"), with an eccentric elliptical\nmodel of the planets, where the planets spin on their axes and follow\nelliptical orbits, the Sun and the Moon revolving around the Earth in\n[epicycles](/wiki/Epicycles \"Epicycles\").

They also made a calculation of the [gravitational\nconstant](/wiki/Gravitational_constant \"Gravitational constant\") by recording\nthe oscillations of a pendulum.[9]\n\nIn the late 17th century, as a result of [Robert Hooke](/wiki/Robert_Hooke\n\"Robert Hooke\")'s suggestion that there is a gravitational force which depends\non the [inverse square](/wiki/Inverse-square_law \"Inverse-square law\") of the\n[distance](/wiki/Distance \"Distance\"),[10] [Isaac Newton](/wiki/Isaac_Newton\n\"Isaac Newton\") was able to [mathematically](/wiki/Mathematical_model\n\"Mathematical model\") derive [Kepler's](/wiki/Johannes_Kepler#Scientific_work\n\"Johannes Kepler\") three [kinematic](/wiki/Kinematics \"Kinematics\") [laws of\nplanetary motion](/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion \"Kepler's laws of\nplanetary motion\"), including the [elliptical](/wiki/Ellipse \"Ellipse\")\n[orbits](/wiki/Orbits \"Orbits\") for the six then known [planets](/wiki/Planet\n\"Planet\") and the Moon:\n\n> \"I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be\n> reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which\n> they revolve, and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in\n> her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth and found them\n> to answer pretty nearly.\"\n>\n> — Isaac Newton, 1666\n\nSo Newton's original formula was:\n\n     F o r c e o f g r a v i t y ∝ m a s s o f o b j e c t 1 × m a s s o f o b j e c t 2 d i s t a n c e f r o m c e n t e r s 2 {\\displaystyle {\\rm {Force\\,of\\,gravity}}\\propto {\\frac {\\rm {mass\\,of\\,object\\,1\\,\\times \\,mass\\,of\\,object\\,2}}{\\rm {distance\\,from\\,centers^{2}}}}} ![{{\\\\rm {Force\\\\,of\\\\,gravity}}}\\\\propto {\\\\frac  {{\\\\rm {mass\\\\,of\\\\,object\\\\,1\\\\,\\\\times \\\\,mass\\\\,of\\\\,object\\\\,2}}}{{\\\\rm {distance\\\\,from\\\\,centers^{2}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0aab6501a8e9379b68a05b789c758f6126e0cab1)\n\nwhere the symbol  ∝ {\\displaystyle \\propto } ![\\\\propto\n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0e3a55007ba2f092d6cafe6d33598e0608b81150)\nmeans \"is proportional to\".\n\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a\nmultiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no\nmatter the value of the masses or distance between them. This [gravitational\nconstant](/wiki/Gravitational_constant \"Gravitational constant\") was first\nmeasured in 1797 by [Henry Cavendish](/wiki/Henry_Cavendish \"Henry\nCavendish\").\n\nIn 1907 [Albert Einstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein \"Albert Einstein\"), in what\nwas described by him as \"_the happiest thought of my life_ \", realized that an\nobserver who is falling from the roof of a house experiences no gravitational\nfield. In other words, gravitation was exactly equivalent to\n[acceleration](/wiki/Acceleration \"Acceleration\"). Between 1911 and 1915 this\nidea, initially stated as the [equivalence\nprinciple](/wiki/Equivalence_principle \"Equivalence principle\"), was formally\ndeveloped into Einstein's theory of [general\nrelativity](/wiki/General_relativity \"General relativity\").\n\n### Newton's theory of\ngravitation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_gravitational_theory&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Newton's theory of gravitation\")]\n\nMain article: [Law of universal\ngravitation](/wiki/Law_of_universal_gravitation \"Law of universal\ngravitation\")\n\nIn 1687, English mathematician [Sir Isaac Newton](/wiki/Sir_Isaac_Newton \"Sir\nIsaac Newton\") published\n_[Principia](/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica\n\"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\")_ , which hypothesizes the\n[inverse-square law](/wiki/Inverse-square_law \"Inverse-square law\") of\nuniversal gravitation. In his own words, \"I deduced that the forces which keep\nthe planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their\ndistances from the centers about which they revolve; and thereby compared the\nforce requisite to keep the Moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the\nsurface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly.\"\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the\nexistence of [Neptune](/wiki/Neptune \"Neptune\") based on motions of\n[Uranus](/wiki/Uranus \"Uranus\") that could not be accounted by the actions of\nthe other planets. Calculations by [John Couch Adams](/wiki/John_Couch_Adams\n\"John Couch Adams\") and [Urbain Le Verrier](/wiki/Urbain_Le_Verrier \"Urbain Le\nVerrier\") both predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's\ncalculations are what led [Johann Gottfried\nGalle](/wiki/Johann_Gottfried_Galle \"Johann Gottfried Galle\") to the discovery\nof Neptune.\n\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed\nNewton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known\nthat the orbit of [Mercury](/wiki/Mercury_\\(planet\\) \"Mercury \\(planet\\)\")\ncould not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches\nfor another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the [Sun](/wiki/Sun\n\"Sun\") even closer than Mercury) have been fruitless. This issue was resolved\nin 1915 by [Albert Einstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein \"Albert Einstein\")'s new\ngeneral theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's\norbit.\n\n[Paul Dirac](/wiki/Paul_Dirac \"Paul Dirac\") developed the hypothesis that\ngravitation should have slowly and steadily decreased over the course of the\nhistory of the universe.[11]\n\nAlthough Newton's theory has been superseded, most modern non-relativistic\ngravitational calculations still use it because it is much easier to work with\nand is sufficiently accurate for most applications.\n\n### Mechanical explanations of\ngravitation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_gravitational_theory&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Mechanical explanations of gravitation\")]\n\nMain article: [Mechanical explanations of\ngravitation](/wiki/Mechanical_explanations_of_gravitation \"Mechanical\nexplanations of gravitation\")\n\nThe mechanical theories or explanations of the gravitation are attempts to\nexplain the law of gravity by aid of basic mechanical processes, such as\npushes, and without the use of any [action at a\ndistance](/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_\\(physics\\) \"Action at a distance\n\\(physics\\)\"). These theories were developed from the 16th until the 19th\ncentury in connection with the [aether theories](/wiki/Aether_theories \"Aether\ntheories\").[12]\n\n[René Descartes](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes \"René Descartes\") (1644) and\n[Christiaan Huygens](/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens \"Christiaan Huygens\") (1690)\nused [vortices](/wiki/Vortices \"Vortices\") to explain gravitation. [Robert\nHooke](/wiki/Robert_Hooke \"Robert Hooke\") (1671) and [James\nChallis](/wiki/James_Challis \"James Challis\") (1869) assumed, that every body\nemits waves which lead to an attraction of other bodies. [Nicolas Fatio de\nDuillier](/wiki/Nicolas_Fatio_de_Duillier \"Nicolas Fatio de Duillier\") (1690)\nand [Georges-Louis Le Sage](/wiki/Georges-Louis_Le_Sage \"Georges-Louis Le\nSage\") (1748) proposed a [corpuscular\nmodel](/wiki/Le_Sage%27s_theory_of_gravitation \"Le Sage's theory of\ngravitation\"), using some sort of screening or shadowing mechanism. Later a\nsimilar model was created by [Hendrik Lorentz](/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz \"Hendrik\nLorentz\"), who used [electromagnetic\nradiation](/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation \"Electromagnetic radiation\")\ninstead of the corpuscles. [Isaac Newton](/wiki/Isaac_Newton \"Isaac Newton\")\n(1675) and [Bernhard Riemann](/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann \"Bernhard Riemann\")\n(1853) argued that aether streams carry all bodies to each other. Newton\n(1717) and [Leonhard Euler](/wiki/Leonhard_Euler \"Leonhard Euler\") (1760)\nproposed a model, in which the aether loses density near the masses, leading\nto a net force directing to the bodies. [Lord Kelvin](/wiki/Lord_Kelvin \"Lord\nKelvin\") (1871) proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an\nexplanation of gravitation and the [electric charges](/wiki/Electric_charges\n\"Electric charges\").\n\nHowever, those models were overthrown because most of them lead to an\nunacceptable amount of [drag](/wiki/Drag_\\(physics\\) \"Drag \\(physics\\)\"),\nwhich is not observed. Other models are violating the [energy conservation\nlaw](/wiki/Energy_conservation_law \"Energy conservation law\") and are\nincompatible with modern [thermodynamics](/wiki/Thermodynamics\n\"Thermodynamics\").[13]\n\n### General\nrelativity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_gravitational_theory&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: General relativity\")]\n\nMain article: [Introduction to general\nrelativity](/wiki/Introduction_to_general_relativity \"Introduction to general\nrelativity\")\n\nIn **[general relativity](/wiki/General_relativity \"General relativity\")** ,\nthe effects of gravitation are ascribed to [spacetime](/wiki/Spacetime\n\"Spacetime\") [curvature](/wiki/Curvature \"Curvature\") instead of to a force.\nThe starting point for general relativity is the [equivalence\nprinciple](/wiki/Equivalence_principle \"Equivalence principle\"), which equates\nfree fall with inertial motion. The issue that this creates is that free-\nfalling objects can accelerate with respect to each other. In [Newtonian\nphysics](/wiki/Newtonian_physics \"Newtonian physics\"), no such acceleration\ncan occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force\n(and therefore is not moving inertially).\n\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by\nmatter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths\nin curved spacetime. (This type of path is called a\n[geodesic](/wiki/Geodesic_\\(general_relativity\\) \"Geodesic \\(general\nrelativity\\)\")). More specifically, Einstein and Hilbert discovered the [field\nequations](/wiki/Field_equation \"Field equation\") of general relativity, which\nrelate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named\nafter Einstein. The [Einstein field equations](/wiki/Einstein_field_equations\n\"Einstein field equations\") are a set of 10\n[simultaneous](/wiki/Simultaneous_equation \"Simultaneous equation\"), [non-\nlinear](/wiki/Nonlinearity \"Nonlinearity\"), [differential\nequations](/wiki/Differential_equation \"Differential equation\"). The solutions\nof the field equations are the components of the [metric\ntensor](/wiki/Metric_tensor_\\(general_relativity\\) \"Metric tensor \\(general\nrelativity\\)\") of spacetime. A metric tensor describes the geometry of\nspacetime. The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric\ntensor.\n\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n\n  * The [Schwarzschild solution](/wiki/Schwarzschild_solution \"Schwarzschild solution\"), which describes spacetime surrounding a [spherically symmetric](/wiki/Spherical_symmetry \"Spherical symmetry\") non-[rotating](/wiki/Rotation \"Rotation\") uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated a [black hole](/wiki/Black_hole \"Black hole\") with a central [singularity](/wiki/Gravitational_singularity \"Gravitational singularity\"). For radial distances from the center which are much greater than the [Schwarzschild radius](/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius \"Schwarzschild radius\"), the accelerations predicted by the Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by Newton's theory of gravity.\n  * The [Reissner–Nordström solution](/wiki/Reissner%E2%80%93Nordstr%C3%B6m_black_hole \"Reissner–Nordström black hole\"), in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [geometrized](/wiki/Geometrized \"Geometrized\") length which are less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [event horizon](/wiki/Event_horizon \"Event horizon\") surrounding a [Cauchy horizon](/wiki/Cauchy_horizon \"Cauchy horizon\").\n  * The [Kerr solution](/wiki/Kerr_solution \"Kerr solution\") for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.\n  * The [cosmological](/wiki/Physical_cosmology \"Physical cosmology\") [Robertson–Walker solution](/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_coordinates \"Robertson–Walker coordinates\"), which predicts the expansion of the [universe](/wiki/Universe \"Universe\").\n\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because of the way its predictions\nof phenomena which are not called for by the older theory of gravity have been\nregularly confirmed. For example:\n\n  * General relativity accounts for the anomalous [perihelion](/wiki/Apsis \"Apsis\") [precession](/wiki/Precession \"Precession\") of the planet [Mercury](/wiki/Mercury_\\(planet\\) \"Mercury \\(planet\\)\").\n  * The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the [Pound–Rebka experiment](/wiki/Pound%E2%80%93Rebka_experiment \"Pound–Rebka experiment\"), the [Hafele–Keating experiment](/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment \"Hafele–Keating experiment\"), and the [GPS](/wiki/GPS \"GPS\").\n  * The prediction of the deflection of light was first confirmed by [Arthur Eddington](/wiki/Arthur_Eddington \"Arthur Eddington\") in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a [quasar](/wiki/Quasar \"Quasar\") which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth. See also [gravitational lensing](/wiki/Gravitational_lensing \"Gravitational lensing\").\n  * The [time delay of light](/wiki/Time_delay_of_light \"Time delay of light\") passing close to a massive object was first identified by [Irwin Shapiro](/wiki/Irwin_Shapiro \"Irwin Shapiro\") in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.\n  * [Gravitational radiation](/wiki/Gravitational_radiation \"Gravitational radiation\") has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [pulsars](/wiki/Pulsar \"Pulsar\"). In 2016, the [LIGO](/wiki/LIGO \"LIGO\") experiments directly detected gravitational radiation from two colliding black holes, making this the first direct observation of both the gravitational radiation as well as black holes.\n  * The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [Robertson–Walker metric](/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric \"Robertson–Walker metric\")) was confirmed by [Edwin Hubble](/wiki/Edwin_Hubble \"Edwin Hubble\") in 1929.\n\n### Gravity and quantum\nmechanics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_gravitational_theory&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Gravity and quantum mechanics\")]\n\nMain articles: [Graviton](/wiki/Graviton \"Graviton\") and [Quantum\ngravity](/wiki/Quantum_gravity \"Quantum gravity\")\n\nSeveral decades after the discovery of general relativity it was realized that\nit cannot be the complete theory of gravity because it is incompatible with\n[quantum mechanics](/wiki/Quantum_mechanics \"Quantum mechanics\").[14] Later it\nwas understood that it is possible to describe gravity in the framework of\n[quantum field theory](/wiki/Quantum_field_theory \"Quantum field theory\") like\nthe other [fundamental forces](/wiki/Fundamental_forces \"Fundamental forces\").\nIn this framework the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of\n[virtual](/wiki/Virtual_particle \"Virtual particle\")\n[gravitons](/wiki/Gravitons \"Gravitons\"), in the same way as the\nelectromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual [photons](/wiki/Photons\n\"Photons\").[15][16] This reproduces general relativity in the [classical\nlimit](/wiki/Classical_limit \"Classical limit\"), but only at the linearized\nlevel and postulating that the conditions for the applicability of Ehrenfest\ntheorem holds, which is not always the case. Besides, this approach fails at\nshort distances of the order of the [Planck length](/wiki/Planck_length\n\"Planck length\").[14]\n\nIt is notable that in general relativity, gravitational radiation, which under\nthe rules of quantum mechanics must be composed of gravitons, is created only\nin situations where the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such as is the\ncase with co-orbiting objects. The amount of gravitational radiation emitted\nby the [solar system](/wiki/Solar_system \"Solar system\") is far too small to\nmeasure.\n\nHowever, gravitational radiation has been observed both indirectly, as an\nenergy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as [PSR\n1913+16](/wiki/PSR_1913%2B16 \"PSR 1913+16\"), and directly by the\n[LIGO](/wiki/LIGO \"LIGO\") gravitational wave observatory, whose [first\ndetection](/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves \"First observation\nof gravitational waves\") (named GW150914) occurred on 14 September 2015[17]\nand matched theoretical predictions of signals due to the inward spiral and\nmerger of a pair of black holes. It is believed that [neutron\nstar](/wiki/Neutron_star \"Neutron star\") mergers (since detected in 2017)[18]\nand [black hole](/wiki/Black_hole \"Black hole\") formation may also create\ndetectable amounts of gravitational radiation.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_gravitational_theory&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [![A Swarm of Ancient Stars - GPN-2000-000930.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/A_Swarm_of_Ancient_Stars_-_GPN-2000-000930.jpg/27px-A_Swarm_of_Ancient_Stars_-_GPN-2000-000930.jpg)](/wiki/File:A_Swarm_of_Ancient_Stars_-_GPN-2000-000930.jpg) [Gravitation portal](/wiki/Portal:Gravitation \"Portal:Gravitation\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_gravitational_theory&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Edward Grant, _The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages_ , (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.
