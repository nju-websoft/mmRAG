He is portrayed by [Kevin Spacey](/wiki/Kevin_Spacey \"Kevin\nSpacey\"). He is based on [Francis Urquhart](/wiki/Francis_Urquhart \"Francis\nUrquhart\"), the protagonist of the British novel and television series _[House\nof Cards](/wiki/House_of_Cards_\\(UK_TV_series\\) \"House of Cards \\(UK TV\nseries\\)\")_ , from which the American [Netflix](/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\")\nseries is drawn. He is married to [Claire Underwood](/wiki/Claire_Underwood\n\"Claire Underwood\") ([Robin Wright](/wiki/Robin_Wright \"Robin Wright\")), but\nalso had a sexual relationship with Zoe Barnes ([Kate Mara](/wiki/Kate_Mara\n\"Kate Mara\")) in [season 1](/wiki/House_of_Cards_\\(season_1\\) \"House of Cards\n\\(season 1\\)\"). He made his first appearance in the series' [pilot\nepisode](/wiki/Pilot_episode \"Pilot episode\"), \"[Chapter\n1](/wiki/Chapter_1_\\(House_of_Cards\\) \"Chapter 1 \\(House of Cards\\)\")\".\n\nUnderwood is from [Gaffney, South Carolina](/wiki/Gaffney,_South_Carolina\n\"Gaffney, South Carolina\"). He graduated from The Sentinel (a fictionalized\nversion of [The Citadel, The Military College of South\nCarolina](/wiki/The_Citadel,_The_Military_College_of_South_Carolina \"The\nCitadel, The Military College of South Carolina\")) in 1981 and, subsequently,\n[Harvard Law School](/wiki/Harvard_Law_School \"Harvard Law School\") in 1984.\nSome of Underwood's dialogue throughout the series is presented in a direct\naddress to the audience, a narrative technique that breaks the [fourth\nwall](/wiki/Fourth_wall \"Fourth wall\"). The character speaks with a [Southern\naccent](/wiki/Southern_American_English \"Southern American English\"). During\nseason 1, he is the [Democratic](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Democratic Party \\(United States\\)\") [Majority\nWhip](/wiki/House_Majority_Whip \"House Majority Whip\") in the [United States\nHouse of Representatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United\nStates House of Representatives\").

Throughout the\nseries, he manipulates and destroys several people, including those he calls\nfriends, for his own ends. Among other crimes, he personally commits murder\ntwice, signs off on another murder committed by a subordinate, orders the\ndeaths of two former employees, critically injures a member of his cabinet to\nprevent her testifying against him, and [indirectly allows for murder of a\ncivilian for political ends](/wiki/False_flag \"False flag\").\n\nSpacey has received positive reviews for his portrayal of Frank Underwood, but\nthe character itself has been criticized for its repetitive nature[1][2] and\none-dimensionality.[3][4] Spacey shared the distinction of being among the\nfirst three leading web-television roles to be nominated for [Primetime Emmy\nAwards](/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award \"Primetime Emmy Award\") at the [65th\nPrimetime Emmy Awards](/wiki/65th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards \"65th Primetime Emmy\nAwards\").

Underwood was born on November 5, 1959, to Catherine and Calvin T.\nUnderwood in [Gaffney, South Carolina](/wiki/Gaffney,_South_Carolina \"Gaffney,\nSouth Carolina\"). He is an only child.[5] He was raised in impoverished\ncircumstances, with the threat of bank foreclosure on the farm they lived on.\nHe entered The Sentinel, a military school in [Charleston, South\nCarolina](/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina \"Charleston, South Carolina\"),\nloosely based on [The Citadel, The Military College of South\nCarolina](/wiki/The_Citadel,_The_Military_College_of_South_Carolina \"The\nCitadel, The Military College of South Carolina\"), in the fall of 1976. He\ngraduated in 1981 and, despite having made poor grades, gained admittance into\n[Harvard Law School](/wiki/Harvard_Law_School \"Harvard Law School\"). He\ngraduated from there in 1984.[5][6][7] While at the Sentinel, he had a\n[homosexual](/wiki/Homosexual \"Homosexual\") relationship with his roommate,\nTim Corbet, which lasted until his first year of law school. Underwood was\nraised Christian but holds God in complete contempt.[8]\n\n###\nFamily[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Frank_Underwood_\\(House_of_Cards\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Family\")]\n\nUnderwood's great-great-great-grandfather, Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood,\nwas a [Confederate](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of\nAmerica\") soldier who served in the 12th [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina\n\"South Carolina\") [Infantry](/wiki/Infantry \"Infantry\")\n[Regiment](/wiki/Regiment \"Regiment\") of McGowan's Brigade at the [Battle of\nSpotsylvania](/wiki/Battle_of_Spotsylvania_Court_House \"Battle of Spotsylvania\nCourt House\"). He served at the Bloody Angle on May 12, 1864, during the\n[Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") and was killed by a\nbludgeon to the back of the head from his own regiment during the middle of\nthe night. Underwood is fascinated by his ancestry. When Underwood falls into\na coma following an assassination attempt, Augustus appears in several of his\nhallucinations. However, he dismisses the Confederacy as weak and calls their\ncause of preserving the institution of slavery \"asinine\". His great-great\ngrandfather was two when Augustus was killed.[9]\n\nHis father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach farmer in his home town of\nGaffney who died at the age of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in\npoverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan\nand avoid foreclosure, his father attended a meeting of the [Ku Klux\nKlan](/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan \"Ku Klux Klan\"), of which the bank manager was a\nmember. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public,[10] but this is a\npolitical ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father\nas a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life.[11] He even urinates on\nhis father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however,\nUnderwood was influenced by him.[12] Calvin was an abusive\n[alcoholic](/wiki/Alcoholic \"Alcoholic\") and caused his wife and son years of\nmisery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father\nputting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he\nrefused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father\nwhen he had the chance.[13]\n\n### Political\ncareer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Frank_Underwood_\\(House_of_Cards\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Political career\")]\n\n#### South Carolina\nLegislature[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Frank_Underwood_\\(House_of_Cards\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: South Carolina Legislature\")]\n\nUnderwood was elected at the age of 25 to the [South Carolina State\nSenate](/wiki/South_Carolina_Senate \"South Carolina Senate\") as one of the\nyoungest members in the state's legislative history after graduating from\n[Harvard](/wiki/Harvard_University \"Harvard University\") in 1984. He was re-\nelected to the state senate at 29 in 1988 for his second, and last, term as a\nState [Senator](/wiki/Senate \"Senate\").\n\n#### Congressional\nElection[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Frank_Underwood_\\(House_of_Cards\\)&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Congressional Election\")]\n\nUnderwood was elected to the [U.S. House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") in 1990 as a\n[Democratic](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party\n\\(United States\\)\") representative for the [5th Congressional District of\nSouth Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina%27s_5th_congressional_district \"South\nCarolina's 5th congressional district\"), being sworn in during January 1991.\nHe won another 11 consecutive elections, winning his final term in 2012. He\nwas elected [Whip](/wiki/Whip_\\(politics\\) \"Whip \\(politics\\)\") for the\nDemocratic Party in 2005, serving as [House Majority\nWhip](/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives \"Party\nleaders of the United States House of Representatives\") between 2005 and 2013.\n\nOften, Underwood's thoughts throughout the series are presented in a direct\naddress to the audience, a narrative technique known as breaking the [fourth\nwall](/wiki/Fourth_wall \"Fourth wall\").[14] Immediately prior to starring in\n_House of Cards_ , Spacey had starred in a production of [William\nShakespeare](/wiki/William_Shakespeare \"William Shakespeare\")'s _[Richard\nIII](/wiki/Richard_III_\\(play\\) \"Richard III \\(play\\)\")_ as [Richard III of\nEngland](/wiki/Richard_III_of_England \"Richard III of England\"),[14][15] a\ncharacter that serves as a partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood.[16]\nHis last name is derived from [Oscar Underwood](/wiki/Oscar_Underwood \"Oscar\nUnderwood\"), who served as the first Democratic [House Minority\nWhip](/wiki/House_Minority_Whip \"House Minority Whip\") from about 1900 to\n1901.[17] His few vices include smoking cigarettes and playing [video\ngames](/wiki/Video_games \"Video games\");[18] when the Secret Service cuts off\nhis online gaming service after he becomes Vice President, he takes up\ncreating model figurines.\n\nSpacey viewed portraying Underwood for a second season as a continuing\nlearning process. \"There is so much I don’t know about Francis, so much that\nI'm learning... I've always thought that the profession closest to that of an\nactor is being a detective... We are given clues by writers... Then you lay\nthem all out and try to make them come alive as a character who’s complex and\nsurprising, maybe even to yourself.\"[19]\n\nUnderwood's sexuality is ambiguous throughout much of the first two seasons;\nhe has sexual liaisons with both men and women, but he is never explicitly\nidentified by any sexual label. Before Season 2, various sources speculated\nabout his homosexuality. It is revealed in \"Chapter 8\" he had an experience\nwith homosexuality in college.[20] Underwood and Claire are never depicted\nhaving sex in season 1.[20] _[Slate](/wiki/Slate_\\(magazine\\) \"Slate\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ journalist [Hanna Rosin](/wiki/Hanna_Rosin \"Hanna Rosin\")\nnoted: if Frank and Claire Underwood were a real-life Washington couple and\nthey were found each to be having an affair, he would be accused of being\n\"secretly gay, turned on by women only when he can use them for a pure power\nplay\".[21] Other sources make no definite stance on Underwood's sexuality, but\nhypothesize that he is not sexually attracted to Claire.[22] In season 2,\nUnderwood is involved in a [threesome](/wiki/Threesome \"Threesome\") with\nClaire and Secret Service agent Edward Meechum ([Nathan\nDarrow](/wiki/Nathan_Darrow \"Nathan Darrow\")),[23] while in season 3, there is\na moment of sexual tension between Underwood and his biographer, Tom Yates\n([Paul Sparks](/wiki/Paul_Sparks \"Paul Sparks\")). The same season, however,\nalso features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have\nsex exclusively with each other. In season five, he has sex with Eric Rawlings\n([Malcolm Madera](/w/index.php?title=Malcolm_Madera&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Malcolm Madera \\(page does not exist\\)\")), his male personal trainer.\n\nAccording to _[Time](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\")_ television\ncritic [James Poniewozik](/wiki/James_Poniewozik \"James Poniewozik\"), by the\nend of the first episode, it becomes clear that Underwood both literally and\nfiguratively uses meat as his metaphor of choice. He may begin a day with a\ncelebratory rack of ribs, because \"I'm feelin' hungry today!\", and he depicts\nhis life with meat metaphors. For example, he describes the White House Chief\nof Staff with grudging admiration: \"She’s as tough as a two-dollar steak\" and\nplans to destroy an enemy the way \"you devour a whale. One bite at a time\". He\nalso endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, as he tells the\naudience, by \"[imagining] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet.\"[24]\n\nTim Goodman of _[The Hollywood Reporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The\nHollywood Reporter\")_ notes that, in Season 2, with Underwood's new position\nas Vice President, \"He's got more power now and that means he instills more\nfear in his enemies\".[25] At one point during the season, he states \"The road\nto power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties. I need to prove what the vice\npresident is capable of.\"[26] Underwood and Claire \"continue their ruthless\nrise to power as threats mount on all fronts.\"[27]\n\n### Underwood vs.\nUrquhart[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Frank_Underwood_\\(House_of_Cards\\)&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Underwood vs. Urquhart\")]\n\nUnderwood is an Americanized version of the original BBC series lead character\n[Francis Urquhart](/wiki/Francis_Urquhart \"Francis Urquhart\"), a\n[Machiavellian](/wiki/Machiavellianism \"Machiavellianism\") post-[Margaret\nThatcher](/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher \"Margaret Thatcher\") [Chief Whip of the\nConservative Party](/wiki/Chief_Whip_of_the_Conservative_Party \"Chief Whip of\nthe Conservative Party\"). Urquhart employs deceit, cunning, murder, and\nblackmail to influence and pursue the office of [Prime Minister of the United\nKingdom](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Prime Minister of the\nUnited Kingdom\"). According to series producer [Beau\nWillimon](/wiki/Beau_Willimon \"Beau Willimon\"), the change in last name\nstemmed from the \"[Dickensian](/wiki/Dickensian \"Dickensian\")\" feeling and\n\"more legitimately American\" sounding resonance of the name 'Underwood'.\nWhereas Urquhart is an aristocrat by birth, Underwood is a [self-made\nman](/wiki/Self-made_man \"Self-made man\"), having been born into a poor\nSouthern family with an alcoholic father.[28] Urquhart was one of television's\nfirst [antiheroes](/wiki/Antihero \"Antihero\"),[16] whereas Underwood follows\nthe more recent rash of antiheroes that includes [Tony\nSoprano](/wiki/Tony_Soprano \"Tony Soprano\") of _[The\nSopranos](/wiki/The_Sopranos \"The Sopranos\")_ , [Walter\nWhite](/wiki/Walter_White_\\(Breaking_Bad\\) \"Walter White \\(Breaking Bad\\)\") of\n_[Breaking Bad](/wiki/Breaking_Bad \"Breaking Bad\")_ , and [Dexter\nMorgan](/wiki/Dexter_Morgan \"Dexter Morgan\") of\n_[Dexter](/wiki/Dexter_\\(TV_series\\) \"Dexter \\(TV series\\)\")_.[15] However,\nunlike most other antiheroes, Underwood is not forced into immorality either\nby circumstance (White), birth (Soprano) or upbringing (Morgan). In his review\nof Season 2, _[Slant Magazine](/wiki/Slant_Magazine \"Slant Magazine\")_ 's Alan\nJones writes that Underwood is evil by choice.[29] Although the character is\nbased on the BBC show's lead character, in interviews during the writing and\nfilming of [season 2](/wiki/House_of_Cards_\\(season_2\\) \"House of Cards\n\\(season 2\\)\"), creator and showrunner Willimon said that he used [Lyndon B.\nJohnson](/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson \"Lyndon B. Johnson\") as a source of themes\nand issues addressed in _House of Cards_.[30] Unlike the [right-\nwing](/wiki/Political_right \"Political right\") Urquhart, who leads the\n[Conservative Party](/wiki/Conservative_Party_\\(UK\\) \"Conservative Party\n\\(UK\\)\"), the [center-left](/wiki/Center-left \"Center-left\") Underwood is a\nmember of the Democratic Party, but cares little for ideology in favor of\n\"ruthless pragmatism\" in furthering his own political influence and power.[5]\n\n### Relationship with Claire\nUnderwood[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Frank_Underwood_\\(House_of_Cards\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Relationship with Claire Underwood\")]\n\nStelter described Frank and Claire Underwood as a \"scheming\" couple.[31]\n[Michael Dobbs](/wiki/Michael_Dobbs \"Michael Dobbs\"), the author of the\ntrilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the\ncompelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the\noriginal miniseries, and likens them to [Macbeth](/wiki/Macbeth_\\(character\\)\n\"Macbeth \\(character\\)\") and [Lady Macbeth](/wiki/Lady_Macbeth \"Lady\nMacbeth\").[16] Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots\nwith her at night. He says, \"I love that woman. I love her more than sharks\nlove blood.\"[32] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like [Lady\nMacbeth](/wiki/Lady_Macbeth \"Lady Macbeth\"), encourages her husband to do\nwhatever is necessary to seize power.[33][34] [Hank\nStuever](/wiki/Hank_Stuever \"Hank Stuever\") of _[The Washington\nPost](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_ describes her as an\nice-queen wife.[35] She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of\nhis weakness, saying, \"My husband doesn’t apologize... even to me.\"[34] Her\novert encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis.[24] Smith says\n\"The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in\ntheir pursuit and lust of power.\"[36] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of\nseason 2, Goodman says the series \"...sells husband and wife power-at-all-\ncosts couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good.\"[25]\nWillimon notes that \"What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is\ndeep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on\na completely different set of rules than the rest of us typically do.\"[37]\n_[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles Times\")_ critic Mary\nMcNamara makes the case that _House of Cards_ is a love story on many levels,\nbut most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man\nwho will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political\nwife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.[38]\n\nUnderwood and Claire engage in a threesome with their Secret Service bodyguard\nEdward Meechum at one point in season 2, but have otherwise largely given up\nintramarital and extramarital sex in favor of their pursuit of power.\n_[International Business Times](/wiki/International_Business_Times\n\"International Business Times\")_ critic Ellen Killoran notes that this may\nrelate back to Underwood's quotation of [Oscar Wilde](/wiki/Oscar_Wilde \"Oscar\nWilde\") to Zoe Barnes in Season 1: \"A great man once said, 'everything is\nabout sex _except_ sex. Sex is about _power_.'\" Avoiding sex may retain the\nbalance of power in their relationship.[39] His relationship with Claire is\nthe epicenter of season 2.[40]\n\n### Relationship with Zoe\nBarnes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Frank_Underwood_\\(House_of_Cards\\)&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Relationship with Zoe Barnes\")]\n\nUnderwood develops an intimate relationship with _Washington Herald_ and\n_Slugline_ reporter Zoe Barnes ([Kate Mara](/wiki/Kate_Mara \"Kate Mara\")),\nwith Claire's knowledge.[28] As the show begins, Barnes is desperate to rise\nfrom covering the Fairfax County Council beat to covering what's going on\n\"behind the veil of power in the Capitol hallways.\"[35] By the end of the\nfirst episode, Barnes is among the cadre of Underwood's accomplices. They\nbegin a relationship, with Barnes promising to earn his trust and not \"ask any\nquestions\" in return for his supplying her with sensitive political\ninformation.[34] Toward the end of Season 1, she ends their personal\nrelationship and begins investigating his connection to Congressman Peter\nRusso's apparent suicide (Underwood had in fact killed him by locking him in\nhis car in a closed garage).[36] Underwood ultimately kills Barnes in the\nseason 2 premiere, by pushing her in front of an oncoming [Washington\nMetro](/wiki/Washington_Metro \"Washington Metro\") train after she begins to\nfollow clues related to the murder.[41]\n\n### Relationship with Edward\nMeechum[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Frank_Underwood_\\(House_of_Cards\\)&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Relationship with Edward Meechum\")]\n\nUnderwood is fond of the head of his Secret Service detail, Edward Meechum\n([Nathan Darrow](/wiki/Nathan_Darrow \"Nathan Darrow\")), and it is hinted\nseveral times that they harbor unacknowledged sexual feelings for each other.\nWhen Meechum stumbles upon Underwood watching pornography, Underwood and\nClaire joke about there being sexual chemistry between the two men. Shortly\nafter Underwood becomes vice president, he, Claire and Meechum have a\n[threesome](/wiki/Threesome \"Threesome\").\n\nMeechum remains Underwood's bodyguard once he becomes the president, and there\ndoes not appear to be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains\nfiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates ([Paul\nSparks](/wiki/Paul_Sparks \"Paul Sparks\")) not to write anything that would\ndamage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand\nwith a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace\na Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.\n\nWhen Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood during a campaign event, Meechum trades\nfire with the assassin, and both are killed instantly. Meechum's death is one\nof the tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill\nshe is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in [Arlington National\nCemetery](/wiki/Arlington_National_Cemetery \"Arlington National Cemetery\"), a\nrare privilege for a Secret Service agent, though Meechum may have been\neligible, in his own right, as a former member of the US Military who served\nin Afghanistan.
