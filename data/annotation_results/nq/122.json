Normally the right atrium depolarizes slightly earlier\nthan left atrium since the depolarization wave originates in the [sinoatrial\nnode](/wiki/Sinoatrial_node \"Sinoatrial node\"), in the high right atrium and\nthen travels to and through the left atrium. The depolarization front is\ncarried through the atria along semi-specialized conduction pathways including\n[Bachmann's bundle](/wiki/Bachmann%27s_bundle \"Bachmann's bundle\") resulting\nin uniform shaped waves. Depolarization originating elsewhere in the atria\n(atrial ectopics) result in P waves with a different morphology from normal.\n\n##\nPathology[[edit](/w/index.php?title=P_wave_\\(electrocardiography\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Pathology\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/P_pulmonale.svg/220px-\nP_pulmonale.svg.png)](/wiki/File:P_pulmonale.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:P_pulmonale.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCharacteristic peaked P wave of cor pulmonale\n\nPeaked P waves (> 0.25 mV) suggest right atrial enlargement, [cor\npulmonale](/wiki/Cor_pulmonale \"Cor pulmonale\"), (_P pulmonale_ rhythm),[1]\nbut have a low predictive value (~20%).[2]\n\nA P wave with increased amplitude can indicate [hypokalemia](/wiki/Hypokalemia\n\"Hypokalemia\").[3] It can also indicate [right atrial\nenlargement](/wiki/Right_atrial_enlargement \"Right atrial enlargement\").[4]\n\nA P wave with decreased amplitude can indicate\n[hyperkalemia](/wiki/Hyperkalemia \"Hyperkalemia\").\n\nBifid P waves (known as _P mitrale_) indicate left-atrial abnormality - e.g.\ndilatation [5] or hypertrophy.[1]\n\nIf at least three different shaped P waves can be seen in a given ECG lead\ntracing, this implies that even if one of them arises from the SA node, at\nleast two others are arising elsewhere. This is taken as evidence of multiple\n(i.e. at least two) ectopic foci, and is called multifocal (or more correctly,\nmultiform) atrial rhythm if the rate is ≤100) or [multifocal atrial\ntachycardia](/wiki/Multifocal_atrial_tachycardia \"Multifocal atrial\ntachycardia\") if the rate is over 100.[6] This appears particularly commonly\nin exacerbations of [chronic obstructive lung\ndisease](/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease#Exacerbation \"Chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease\").[7]\n\nIf the baseline has a totally irregular form, this suggests fibrillatory waves\nof [atrial fibrillation](/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation#Electrophysiology \"Atrial\nfibrillation\") or possibly artefact; a saw tooth shaped baseline suggests the\nflutter waves of [atrial flutter](/wiki/Atrial_flutter \"Atrial flutter\"). With\neither of these rhythms, if the ventricular rate is fast, the fibrillatory or\nflutter waves can easily be misinterpreted as P waves.\n\nAbsence of the **P wave** with a flat\n[baseline](/wiki/Electrocardiography#Waves_and_intervals\n\"Electrocardiography\") may indicate:\n\n  * Fine [atrial fibrillation](/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation \"Atrial fibrillation\")[1]\n  * [Sinoatrial arrest](/wiki/Sinoatrial_arrest \"Sinoatrial arrest\") (with a secondary [escape rhythm](/wiki/Ventricular_escape_beat \"Ventricular escape beat\"))\n\nIf P waves are not clearly delineated in the surface ECG, a [Lewis\nlead](/wiki/Lewis_lead \"Lewis lead\") may be used to better visualize P waves.\n\n## Atrial\nrepolarization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=P_wave_\\(electrocardiography\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Atrial repolarization\")]\n\nThis occurs a mean of 320 ms after the end of the P wave, with a duration of\n2-3 times that of the P wave and a polarity always opposite to that of the P\nwave. It is represented on the surface ECG by a so-called Ta wave. The\nclinical relevance of this is that, although a normal phenomenon, the nadir of\nthe Ta wave can occur just after the QRS complex and cause ST depression\nsimilar to (and easily mistaken with) that occurring with disease states such\nas cardiac ischaemia.[8]\n\n## Related\npages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=P_wave_\\(electrocardiography\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Related pages\")]\n\n  * [Electrocardiography](/wiki/Electrocardiography \"Electrocardiography\")\n  * [PR interval](/wiki/PR_interval \"PR interval\")\n  * [QRS complex](/wiki/QRS_complex \"QRS complex\")\n  * [QT interval](/wiki/QT_interval \"QT interval\")\n  * [ST segment](/wiki/ST_segment \"ST segment\")\n  * [T wave](/wiki/T_wave \"T wave\")\n  * [U wave](/wiki/U_wave \"U wave\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=P_wave_\\(electrocardiography\\)&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Longmore, Murray (2004). _Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 8th edition page 90_.
