Such [medical\ndegrees](/wiki/Medical_degree \"Medical degree\") include the [Bachelor of\nMedicine, Bachelor of Surgery](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Medicine,_Bachelor_of_Surgery\n\"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\") (MBBS, MBChB, BMBS), [Doctor of\nMedicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine \"Doctor of Medicine\") (MD), or [Doctor of\nOsteopathic Medicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine \"Doctor of\nOsteopathic Medicine\") (DO). Many medical schools offer additional degrees,\nsuch as a [Doctor of Philosophy](/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy \"Doctor of\nPhilosophy\"), [Master's degree](/wiki/Master%27s_degree \"Master's degree\"), a\n[physician assistant](/wiki/Physician_assistant \"Physician assistant\")\nprogram, or other post-secondary education.\n\nMedical schools can also carry out [medical research](/wiki/Medical_research\n\"Medical research\") and operate [teaching hospitals](/wiki/Teaching_hospital\n\"Teaching hospital\"). Around the world, criteria, structure, teaching\nmethodology, and nature of medical programs offered at medical schools vary\nconsiderably. Medical schools are often highly competitive, using standardized\n[entrance examinations](/wiki/Entrance_examination \"Entrance examination\"), as\nwell as grade point average and leadership roles, to narrow the selection\ncriteria for candidates. In most countries, the study of medicine is completed\nas an undergraduate degree not requiring prerequisite undergraduate\ncoursework. However, an increasing number of places are emerging for graduate\nentrants who have completed an undergraduate degree including some required\ncourses. In the United States and Canada, almost all medical degrees are\n[second entry degrees](/wiki/Second_entry_degree \"Second entry degree\"), and\nrequire several years of previous study at the university level.\n\nMedical degrees are awarded to medical students after the completion of their\ndegree program, which typically lasts five or more years for the undergraduate\nmodel and four years for the graduate model. Many modern medical schools\nintegrate clinical education with basic sciences from the beginning of the\ncurriculum (e.g.[1][2]). More traditional curricula are usually divided into\npreclinical and clinical blocks. In preclinical sciences, students study\nsubjects such as [biochemistry](/wiki/Biochemistry \"Biochemistry\"),\n[genetics](/wiki/Genetics \"Genetics\"), [pharmacology](/wiki/Pharmacology\n\"Pharmacology\"), [pathology](/wiki/Pathology \"Pathology\"),\n[anatomy](/wiki/Anatomy \"Anatomy\"), [physiology](/wiki/Physiology\n\"Physiology\") and [medical microbiology](/wiki/Medical_microbiology \"Medical\nmicrobiology\"), among others. Subsequent clinical rotations usually include\n[internal medicine](/wiki/Internal_medicine \"Internal medicine\"), [general\nsurgery](/wiki/General_surgery \"General surgery\"),\n[pediatrics](/wiki/Pediatrics \"Pediatrics\"), [psychiatry](/wiki/Psychiatry\n\"Psychiatry\"), and [obstetrics and gynecology](/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynecology\n\"Obstetrics and gynecology\"), among others.\n\nAlthough medical schools confer upon graduates a medical degree, a physician\ntypically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local\ngovernment authority.[3] Licensing may also require passing a test, undergoing\na criminal background check, checking references, paying a fee, and undergoing\nseveral years of [postgraduate training](/wiki/Residency_\\(medicine\\)\n\"Residency \\(medicine\\)\"). Medical schools are regulated by each country and\nappear in the [World Directory of Medical\nSchools](/wiki/World_Directory_of_Medical_Schools \"World Directory of Medical\nSchools\") which was formed by the merger of the [AVICENNA Directory for\nmedicine](/wiki/WHO_Directory_of_Medical_Schools \"WHO Directory of Medical\nSchools\") and the [FAIMER](/wiki/FAIMER \"FAIMER\") [International Medical\nEducation Directory](/wiki/International_Medical_Education_Directory\n\"International Medical Education Directory\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Africa\n    * 1.1 Ghana\n    * 1.2 Kenya\n    * 1.3 Nigeria\n    * 1.4 South Africa\n    * 1.5 Sudan\n    * 1.6 Tunisia\n    * 1.7 Uganda\n    * 1.8 Zimbabwe\n  * 2 Americas\n    * 2.1 Argentina\n    * 2.2 Bolivia\n    * 2.3 Brazil\n    * 2.4 Canada\n    * 2.5 Caribbean\n    * 2.6 Curaçao\n    * 2.7 Chile\n    * 2.8 Colombia\n    * 2.9 El Salvador\n    * 2.10 Guyana\n    * 2.11 Haiti\n    * 2.12 Panama\n    * 2.13 United States\n    * 2.14 Uruguay\n    * 2.15 Venezuela\n  * 3 Asia and Oceania\n    * 3.1 Australia\n    * 3.2 Bangladesh\n    * 3.3 Cambodia\n    * 3.4 Hong Kong\n    * 3.5 India\n    * 3.6 Indonesia\n    * 3.7 Iran\n    * 3.8 Israel\n    * 3.9 Japan\n    * 3.10 Jordan\n    * 3.11 Kyrgyzstan\n    * 3.12 Lebanon\n    * 3.13 Malaysia\n    * 3.14 Myanmar\n    * 3.15 Nepal\n    * 3.16 New Zealand\n    * 3.17 Pakistan\n    * 3.18 People's Republic of China\n    * 3.19 Philippines\n    * 3.20 Republic of China (Taiwan)\n    * 3.21 Saudi Arabia\n    * 3.22 Singapore\n    * 3.23 South Korea\n    * 3.24 Sri Lanka\n    * 3.25 Thailand\n  * 4 Europe\n    * 4.1 Albania\n    * 4.2 Austria\n    * 4.3 Belarus\n    * 4.4 Bosnia and Herzegovina\n    * 4.5 Bulgaria\n    * 4.6 Croatia\n    * 4.7 Czech Republic\n    * 4.8 Denmark\n    * 4.9 Finland\n    * 4.10 France\n    * 4.11 Germany\n    * 4.12 Greece\n    * 4.13 Hungary\n    * 4.14 Iceland\n    * 4.15 Ireland\n    * 4.16 Italy\n    * 4.17 Lithuania\n    * 4.18 Netherlands and Belgium\n    * 4.19 Norway\n    * 4.20 Poland\n    * 4.21 Portugal\n    * 4.22 Romania\n    * 4.23 Russia\n    * 4.24 Sweden\n    * 4.25 Switzerland\n    * 4.26 Turkey\n    * 4.27 Ukraine\n    * 4.28 United Kingdom\n  * 5 Medical students\n    * 5.1 Bullying\n    * 5.2 Burnout and depression\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 Notes and references\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Africa[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Africa\")]\n\nSee also: [List of medical schools in\nAfrica](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_Africa \"List of medical schools in\nAfrica\")\n\nBy 2005 there were more than 100 medical schools across Africa, most of which\nhad been established after 1970.[4]\n\n### Ghana[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Ghana\")]\n\nThere are seven medical schools in Ghana: The University of Ghana Medical\nSchool in Accra, the KNUST School of Medical Sciences in Kumasi, University\nfor Development Studies School of Medicine in Tamale, University of Cape Coast\nMedical School and the University of Allied Health Sciences in Ho, Volta\nRegion, the leading private medical school in Ghana - the Accra College of\nMedicine,[5] and Family Health Medical School another private medical school.\n\nBasic Medical education lasts 6 years in all the medical schools. Entry into\nthese medical schools are highly competitive and it is usually based on\nsuccessful completion of the Senior High School Examinations. The University\nof Ghana Medical School has however introduced a graduate entry medical\nprogram to admit students with mainly science-related degrees into a 4-year\nmedical school program.\n\nStudents graduating from any of these medical schools get the MBChB degree and\nthe title \"Dr\". For the First 3 years Students are awarded BSc in the field of\nMedical science for University of Ghana medical school; and Human biology for\nKNUST and UDS medical schools. The University of Ghana Medical School and\nKNUST School of Medical Sciences in Kumasi use the Tradition medical education\nmodel whiles University for Development Studies School of Medicine uses the\n**Problem-based learning model**.\n\nMedical graduates are then registered provisionally with the Medical and\nDental Council (MDC) of Ghana as House Officers (Interns). Upon completion of\nthe mandatory 2-year housemanship, these medical doctors are permanently\nregistered with the MDC and can practice as medical officers (General\nPractitioners) anywhere in the country. The housemanship training is done only\nin hospitals accredited for such purposes by the Medical and Dental Council of\nGhana\n\nFollowing the permanent registration with the medical and dental council,\ndoctors can specialize in any of the various fields that is organized by\neither the West African college of Physicians and Surgeons or the Ghana\nCollege of Physician and Surgeons.\n\nMedical officers are also sometimes hired by the [Ghana Health\nService](/wiki/Ghana_Health_Service \"Ghana Health Service\") to work in the\nDistricts/Rural areas as Primary Care Physicians.\n\n### Kenya[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Kenya\")]\n\nIn Kenya, medical school is a faculty of a university. Medical education lasts\nfor 5 years after which the student graduates with an undergraduate\n([MBChB](/wiki/MBChB \"MBChB\")) degree. This is followed by a mandatory\n12-month full-time internship at an approved hospital after which one applies\nfor registration with the [Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists\nBoard](/wiki/Kenya_Medical_Practitioners_and_Dentists_Board \"Kenya Medical\nPractitioners and Dentists Board\") if they intend to practice medicine in the\ncountry. The first two years of medical school cover the basic medical\n(preclinical) sciences while the last four years are focused on the clinical\nsciences and internship.\n\nThere are no medical school entry examinations or interviews and admission is\nbased on students' performance in the high school exit examination ([Kenya\nCertificate of Secondary\nEducation](/wiki/Kenya_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education \"Kenya Certificate\nof Secondary Education\") \\- KCSE). Students who took the [AS\nLevel](/wiki/Advanced_Subsidiary_level \"Advanced Subsidiary level\") or the\n[SAT](/wiki/SAT \"SAT\") can also apply but there is a very strict quota\nlimiting the number of students that get accepted into public universities.\nThis quota does not apply to private universities.\n\nThere are four established public medical schools:\n\n  * [University of Nairobi](/wiki/University_of_Nairobi \"University of Nairobi\") (oldest, established 1967)\n  * [Moi University](/wiki/Moi_University \"Moi University\") in Eldoret (established in the 1980s with major support from the Indiana University School of Medicine - USA, and with whom there remain significant ties)\n  * [Kenyatta University](/wiki/Kenyatta_University \"Kenyatta University\") at Kahawa (established 2004)\n  * [Egerton University](/wiki/Egerton_University \"Egerton University\") in Nakuru (established in 2007)\n  * [Jomo Kanyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](/wiki/Jomo_Kenyatta_University_of_Agriculture_and_Technology \"Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology\")\n  * [Maseno University](/wiki/Maseno_University \"Maseno University\")\n\nBoth Nairobi and Moi Universities run post graduate medical training programs\nthat run over 3 years and lead to the award of master of medicine,\n[MMed](/wiki/MMed \"MMed\"), in the respective specialty.\n\nThere has been progress made by the [Aga Khan\nUniversity](/wiki/Aga_Khan_University \"Aga Khan University\") in\n[Karachi](/wiki/Karachi \"Karachi\"), [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan \"Pakistan\") and\nthe [Aga Khan University Hospital](/wiki/Aga_Khan_University_Hospital,_Nairobi\n\"Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi\") (AKUH) in [Nairobi](/wiki/Nairobi\n\"Nairobi\") towards the establishment of a Health Sciences University in Kenya\nwith an associated medical school. AKUH in Nairobi, already offers post\ngraduate [MMed](/wiki/MMed \"MMed\") programmes. These are run over 4 years.\n\nCompletion of formal specialty training in Kenya is followed by two years of\nsupervised clinical work before one can apply for recognition as a specialist,\nin their respective field, by the medical board.\n\n### Nigeria[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Nigeria\")]\n\nThere are several medical schools in Nigeria. Entrance into these schools is\nhighly competitive. Candidates graduating from high school must attain high\nscores on the West African Examination Council's (WAEC) Senior School\nCertificate Exam (SSCE/GCE) and high scores in four subjects (Physics,\nEnglish, Chemistry, and Biology) in the University Matriculation Examination\n(UME). Students undergo rigorous training for 6 years and culminate with a\nBachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS/MBChB). The undergraduate\nprogram is six years and one year of work experience in government hospitals.\nAfter medical school, graduates are mandated to spend one year of housemanship\n(internship) and one year of community service before they are eligible to be\nfully licensed by the Medical and Dental Council.\n\n### South\nAfrica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: South Africa\")]\n\n    _See also:[List of medical schools in South Africa](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_South_Africa \"List of medical schools in South Africa\"); [Healthcare in South Africa](/wiki/Healthcare_in_South_Africa \"Healthcare in South Africa\"); [Category:Teaching hospitals in South Africa](/wiki/Category:Teaching_hospitals_in_South_Africa \"Category:Teaching hospitals in South Africa\")_\n    _Related:[Dental degree#South Africa](/wiki/Dental_degree#South_Africa \"Dental degree\")_\n\nThere are eight medical schools in [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa \"South\nAfrica\"), each under the auspices of a [public\nuniversity](/wiki/Public_university \"Public university\"). As the country is a\nformer [British colony](/wiki/British_colony \"British colony\"), most of the\ninstitutions follow the British-based undergraduate method of instruction,\nadmitting students directly from high school into a 6 or occasionally five-\nyear program. Some universities such as the [University of the\nWitwatersrand](/wiki/University_of_the_Witwatersrand \"University of the\nWitwatersrand\") in [Johannesburg](/wiki/Johannesburg \"Johannesburg\") and the\n[University of Cape Town](/wiki/University_of_Cape_Town \"University of Cape\nTown\") have started offering [post-graduate medical\ndegrees](/wiki/Graduate_Medical_Program \"Graduate Medical Program\") that run\nconcurrently with their undergraduate programs. In this instance, a student\nhaving completed an appropriate undergraduate degree with basic sciences can\nenter into a four-year postgraduate program.\n\nSouth African medical schools award the\n[MBChB](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Medicine,_Bachelor_of_Surgery#South_Africa \"Bachelor\nof Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\") degree, except the University of the\nWitwatersrand, which styles its degree MBBCh. Some universities allow students\nto earn an intercalated degree, completing a [BSc\n(Medical)](/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree#Medical_and_Health_Sciences \"Bachelor's\ndegree\") with an additional year of study after the second or third year of\nthe MBChB. The University of Cape Town, in particular, has spearheaded a\nrecent effort to increase the level of medical research training and exposure\nof medical students through an Intercalated Honours Programme, with the option\nto extend this to a PhD.[6]\n\nFollowing successful completion of study, all South African medical graduates\nmust complete a two-year internship as well as a further year of community\nservice in order to register with the Health Professions Council and practice\nas a doctor in the country.\n\nSpecialisation is usually a five- to seven-year training process (depending on\nthe specialty) requiring registering as a medical registrar attached to an\nacademic clinical department in a large teaching hospital with appropriate\nexaminations. The specialist qualification may be conferred as a Fellowship by\nthe independent [Colleges of Medicine of South\nAfrica](/wiki/Colleges_of_Medicine_of_South_Africa \"Colleges of Medicine of\nSouth Africa\") (CMSA), following British tradition, or as a [Magisterial\ndegree](/wiki/Master_degree \"Master degree\") by the university (usually the M\nMed, [Master of Medicine](/wiki/Master_of_Medicine \"Master of Medicine\"),\ndegree). The Medical schools and the CMSA also offer [Higher\nDiplomas](/wiki/Higher_Diploma \"Higher Diploma\") in many fields. Research\ndegrees are the M.Med and [Ph.D.](/wiki/Ph.D. \"Ph.D.\") or\n[M.D.](/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine#UK,_Ireland_and_some_Commonwealth_countries\n\"Doctor of Medicine\"), depending on university.\n\nMedical students from all over the world come to South Africa to gain\npractical experience in the country's many teaching hospitals and rural\nclinics. The language of instruction is English but a few indigenous languages\nare studied briefly. The [University of the Free\nState](/wiki/University_of_the_Free_State \"University of the Free State\") has\na parallel medium policy, meaning all English classes are also presented in\nAfrikaans, therefore students who choose to study in Afrikaans, do so\nseparately from the English class.\n\n### Sudan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Sudan\")]\n\nIn Sudan, medical school is a faculty of a university.

Post graduating there is a\nmandatory one-year full-time internship at one of the university or Government\nTeaching hospitals, then a license is issued.\n\nDuring the first three years the curriculum is completed, and throughout the\nnext three years it is repeated with practical training. Students with high\ngrades are accepted for free in Government Universities. Students who score a\ngrade less than the required would have to pay and must also acquire a still\nhigh grade. Students who take foreign examinations other than the Sudanese\nHigh School Examination are also accepted in Universities, students taking\nIGCSE/SATs and other Arabian countries.

Medical school curriculum consists of five\nyears. The first two years are medical theory, containing all basic sciences\nrelated to medicine, and the last three years consists of clinical issues\nrelated to all medical specialties. During these last three years, the student\ngets the status of \"Externe\". The student has to attend at the university\nhospital every day, rotating around all wards. Every period is followed by a\nclinical exam regarding the student's knowledge in that particular specialty.\nAfter those five years, there are two years on internship, in which the\nstudent is a physician but under the supervision of the chief doctor; the\nstudent rotates over the major and most essential specialties during period of\nfour months each. After that, student has the choice of either passing the\nresidency national exam or extending his internship for another year, after\nwhich he gains the status of family physician. The residency program consists\nof four to five years in the specialty he qualifies, depending on his score in\nthe national residency examination under the rule of highest score chooses\nfirst. Whether the student chooses to be a family doctor or a specialist, he\nhas to make a doctorate thesis, which he will be defending in front of a jury,\nafter which he gains his degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD).\n\n### Uganda[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Uganda\")]\n\nMain article: [Medical school in Uganda](/wiki/Medical_school_in_Uganda\n\"Medical school in Uganda\")\n\nAs of April\n2017[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit),\nthere are nine accredited medical schools in [Uganda](/wiki/Uganda\n\"Uganda\").[7] Training leading to the award of the degree of [Bachelor of\nMedicine and Bachelor of\nSurgery](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Medicine_and_Bachelor_of_Surgery \"Bachelor of\nMedicine and Bachelor of Surgery\") ([MBChB](/wiki/MBChB \"MBChB\")) lasts five\nyears, if there are no re-takes.

Each one of the 3000 medical students\nwho graduate each year in Argentina are required before graduation to dedicate\na minimum of 8 months to community service without pay; although in some\nprovinces (especially round the more developed south) there are government-\nfunded hospitals who pay for this work. Some universities have cultural\nexchange programmes that allow a medical student in their final year to serve\ntheir community time overseas.\n\nUpon graduation, one of the following degrees is obtained, according to the\nuniversity: Doctor of Medicine, or both Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of\nSurgery. Public universities usually confer both degrees, and private\nuniversities bestow only Doctor of Medicine. In daily practice, however, there\nis no substantial difference between what a Doctor of Medicine or a Doctor of\nMedicine and Doctor of Surgery are allowed to do. When the degree is obtained,\na record is created for that new doctor in the index of the National Ministry\nof Education (Ministerio Nacional de Educación) and the physician is given\ntheir corresponding medical practitioner's ID, which is a number that\nidentifies him and his academic achievements. In addition, there is a\nprovincial ID, i. e. a number to identify doctors in the province they\npractise medicine in.\n\nDoctors wishing to pursue a [speciality](/wiki/Specialty_\\(medicine\\)\n\"Specialty \\(medicine\\)\") must take entrance exams at the public/private\ninstitution of their choice that offers them. It is easier for students in\nprivate Medical Schools to obtain a residency in a Private Hospital,\nespecially when the university has its own hospital, as the university holds\npositions specifically for its graduates. Speciality courses last about two to\nfive years, depending on the branch of medicine the physician has chosen.\nThere is no legal limit for the number of specialities a doctor can learn,\nalthough most doctors choose to do one and then they sub-specialise for\nfurther job opportunities and less overall competition, along with higher\nwages.\n\nIn Argentina there are public and private medical schools, however the\nprestige of the public institutions is undeniable and the private institutions\ndo not normally appear in international rankings. A person who can afford to\nattend a private university, quite expensive for the average Argentinian, will\nchoose that option over public education because of the smaller groups of\nstudents in each class and because of the lack of strictness in course\nevaluation. By law entrance into public institutions is open and tuition-free\nto all who have a high school diploma, and universities are expressly\nforbidden[9] from restricting access with difficult entrance exams. Point in\ncase, in 2016 La Universidad Nacional de la Plata was obligated by the\ngoverning bodies to stop forcing its students to write an entrance exam. As a\nresult, that university experienced a major increase in the size of its\nstudent population. When it comes to educational quality, la Universidad de\nBuenos Aires, a public university, is widely recognised as the top medical\nschool in the country.[10]\n\n### Bolivia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Bolivia\")]\n\nIn [Bolivia](/wiki/Bolivia \"Bolivia\"), all medical schools are faculties\nwithin a university and offer a five-year M.D. equivalent. To acquire a\nlicense to exercise medical science from the government, all students must\nalso complete 1 year and 3 months of internship. This consists of 3 months\neach of [surgery](/wiki/Surgery \"Surgery\"), [internal\nmedicine](/wiki/Internal_medicine \"Internal medicine\"),\n[gynecology](/wiki/Gynecology \"Gynecology\"), [pediatrics](/wiki/Pediatrics\n\"Pediatrics\") and [public health](/wiki/Public_health \"Public health\"). At\nleast one of the internships must be done in a [rural](/wiki/Rural \"Rural\")\narea of the country. After getting the degree and license, a doctor may take a\npost-graduate residency in order to acquire a specialty.\n\n### Brazil[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Brazil\")]\n\nThe Brazilian medical schools follow the European model of a six-year\ncurriculum, divided into three cycles of two years each.[11] The first two\nyears are called basic cycle (_ciclo básico_). During this time students are\ninstructed in the basic sciences ([anatomy](/wiki/Anatomy \"Anatomy\"),\n[physiology](/wiki/Physiology \"Physiology\"), [pharmacology](/wiki/Pharmacology\n\"Pharmacology\"), [immunology](/wiki/Immunology \"Immunology\") etc.) with\nactivities integrated with the medical specialties, allowing the student an\noverview of the practical application of such content. After its completion,\nthe students advance to the clinical cycle (_ciclo clinico_). At this stage\ncontacts with patients intensify and work with tests and diagnostics, putting\ninto practice what was learned in the first two years. The last two are called\ncycle internship _(ciclo do internato_). In this last step the students focus\non clinical practice, through training in teaching hospitals and clinics. The\nteaching of this last step respecting an axis of increasing complexity,\nenabling students to make decisions and participate effectively in form and\noperative care under the direct supervision of faculty and qualified to act as\nteaching aids physicians. The performance of the internal develops redemption\nof ethical and humanistic dimensions of care, causing the student to recognize\nthe values and principles that guide the physician-patient relationship.\n\nAfter six years of training, students graduate and are awarded the title of\n[physician](/wiki/Physician \"Physician\") (_Médico_) allowing them to register\nwith the Regional Council of Medicine (_Conselho Regional de Medicina_). The\nrecent graduate will be able to exercise the medical profession as a [general\npractitioner](/wiki/General_practitioner \"General practitioner\") and may apply\nto undertake postgraduate training. In 2012, the Regional Council of Medicine\nof São Paulo (_Conselho Regional de Medicina do Estado de São Paulo_)\nestablished that physicians who graduate from this year must pass a test to\nobtain professional registration. Passing the exam, however, is not linked to\nobtaining registration. It required only the presence of the candidate and the\ntest performance. Already at the national level, pending in the Senate a bill\ncreating the National Proficiency Examination in Medicine (_Exame Nacional de\nProficiência em Medicina_), which would make the race a prerequisite for the\nexercise of profession.\n\nPhysicians who want to join a specialization program must undergo a new\nselection examination considered as competitive as that required to join a\nmedical school. Works in health institutions under the guidance of medical\nprofessionals with high ethical and professional qualification. The\nspecialization programs are divided into two categories: direct access and\nprerequisite. The specialties with direct access are those in which the doctor\ncan enroll without having any prior expertise. Any physicians can apply to\nexaminations for these specialties, regardless of time of training or prior\nexperience. To apply to proprietary pre-requisite, the doctor should have\nalready completed a specialty prior. The programs may range from 2 to 6. In\nBrazil are currently recognized by the Federal Council of Medicine, the\nBrazilian Medical Association and the National Commission of Medical Residency\n53 residency programs.

Generally, medical students begin their studies after receiving a\n[bachelor's degree](/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree \"Bachelor's degree\") in another\nfield, often one of the biological sciences. However, admittance can still be\ngranted during third and fourth year. Minimum requirements for admission vary\nby region from two to four years of post-secondary study.

McMaster requires that the MCAT be written, though\nthey only look for particular scores (6 or better) on the verbal reasoning\nportion of the test.\n\nThe first half of the medical curriculum is dedicated mostly to teaching the\nbasic sciences relevant to medicine. Teaching methods can include traditional\n[lectures](/wiki/Lecture \"Lecture\"), [problem-based learning](/wiki/Problem-\nbased_learning \"Problem-based learning\"), laboratory sessions, [simulated\npatient](/wiki/Simulated_patient \"Simulated patient\") sessions, and limited\nclinical experiences. The remainder of medical school is spent in\n[clerkship](/wiki/Medical_clerkship \"Medical clerkship\"). Clinical clerks\nparticipate in the day-to-day management of patients. They are supervised and\ntaught during this clinical experience by residents and fully licensed [staff\nphysicians](/wiki/Attending_physician \"Attending physician\").\n\nStudents enter into the _[Canadian Resident Matching\nService](/wiki/Canadian_Resident_Matching_Service \"Canadian Resident Matching\nService\")_ , commonly abbreviated as _CaRMS_ in the fall of their final year.\nStudents rank their preferences of hospitals and specialties. A computerized\nmatching system determines placement for [residency\npositions](/wiki/Residency_\\(medicine\\) \"Residency \\(medicine\\)\"). 'Match Day'\nusually occurs in March, a few months before graduation.[12] The length of\npost-graduate training varies with choice of specialty.\n\nDuring the final year of medical school, students complete part 1 of the\n[Medical Council of Canada Qualifying\nExamination](https://web.archive.org/web/20070703031148/http://www.mcc.ca/english/examinations/qualifying_e1.html)\n(MCCQE). Upon completion of the final year of medical school, students are\nawarded the degree of M.D. Students then begin training in the residency\nprogram designated to them by CaRMS. Part 2 of the MCCQE, an [Objective\nStructured Clinical\nExamination](/wiki/Objective_Structured_Clinical_Examination \"Objective\nStructured Clinical Examination\"), is taken following completion of twelve\nmonths of residency training. After both parts of the MCCQE are successfully\ncompleted, the resident becomes a _[Licentiate of the Medical Council of\nCanada](https://web.archive.org/web/20070701223129/http://www.mcc.ca/english/registration/index.html)_.\nHowever, in order to practice independently, the resident must complete the\nresidency program and take a board examination pertinent to his or her\nintended scope of practice. In the final year of residency training, residents\ntake an exam administered by either the [College of Family Physicians of\nCanada](/wiki/College_of_Family_Physicians_Canada \"College of Family\nPhysicians Canada\") or the [Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of\nCanada](/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians_and_Surgeons_of_Canada \"Royal\nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada\"), depending on whether they are\nseeking certification in family medicine or another specialty.\n\n### Caribbean[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Caribbean\")]\n\nSee also: [List of medical schools in the\nCaribbean](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_the_Caribbean \"List of medical\nschools in the Caribbean\")\n\nIn 2011, the [International Medical Education\nDirectory](/wiki/International_Medical_Education_Directory \"International\nMedical Education Directory\") listed 59 current medical schools in the\nCaribbean. 54 grant the MD degree, 3 grant the MBBS degree, and 2 grant either\nthe MD or MBBS degree.\n\n30 of the medical schools in the Caribbean are regional, which train students\nto practice in the country or region where the school is located.

The main\nmedical programs are offered by the [Universidad Nacional de\nColombia](/wiki/National_University_of_Colombia \"National University of\nColombia\"), [Pontificia Universidad\nJaveriana](/wiki/Pontifical_Xavierian_University \"Pontifical Xavierian\nUniversity\"), [Universidad del Rosario](/wiki/Del_Rosario_University \"Del\nRosario University\"), [Universidad El Bosque](/wiki/El_Bosque_University \"El\nBosque University\"), [Universidad de los\nAndes](/wiki/University_of_Los_Andes_\\(Colombia\\) \"University of Los Andes\n\\(Colombia\\)\"), [Universidad del\nValle](/wiki/Universidad_del_Valle_\\(Colombia\\) \"Universidad del Valle\n\\(Colombia\\)\"), [Universidad de Antioquia](/wiki/Universidad_de_Antioquia\n\"Universidad de Antioquia\"), and [Universidad de la\nSabana](/wiki/University_of_La_Sabana \"University of La Sabana\"). Most\nprograms require between 6–7 years of study, and all offer a [Doctor of\nMedicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine \"Doctor of Medicine\") (MD) degree. In some\ncases the school also allows for a second degree to be studied for at the same\ntime (this is chosen by the student, though most students end up needing to do\nalternate semesters between their degrees, and mostly in careers like\n[microbiology](/wiki/Microbiology \"Microbiology\") or [biomedical\nengineering](/wiki/Biomedical_engineering \"Biomedical engineering\")). For\nexample, the [Universidad de los\nAndes](/wiki/University_of_Los_Andes_\\(Colombia\\) \"University of Los Andes\n\\(Colombia\\)\") has a program whereby the medical student could graduate with\nboth an MD and a [Master of Business\nAdministration](/wiki/Master_of_Business_Administration \"Master of Business\nAdministration\") (MBA) degree, or an MD and a master's degree in [public\nhealth](/wiki/Public_health \"Public health\"). Admission to medical school\nvaries with the school, but is usually dependent on a combination of a general\napplication to the university, an entrance exam, a personal statement or\ninterview, and secondary (high) school performance mostly as reflected on the\n[ICFES](/wiki/ICFES_Examination \"ICFES Examination\") score (the grade received\non the state exam in the final year of secondary/high school).\n\nIn most medical programs, the first two years deal with basic scientific\ncourses (cellular and molecular biology, chemistry, organic chemistry,\nmathematics, and physics), and the core medical sciences (anatomy, embryology,\nhistology, physiology, and biochemistry). The following year may change in how\nit is organized in different schools, but is usually organ system-based\npathophysiology and therapeutics (general and systems pathology, pharmacology,\nmicrobiology, parasitology, immunology, and medical genetics are also taught\nin this block). In the first two years, the programs also usually begin the\ncourses in the epidemiology track (which may or may not include\nbiostatistics), a clinical skills track (semiology and the clinical\nexamination), a social medicine/public health track, and a medical ethics and\ncommunication skills track. Modes of training vary, but are usually based on\nlectures, simulations, standardized-patient sessions, problem-based learning\nsessions, seminars, and observational clinical experiences. By year three,\nmost schools have begun the non-elective, clinical-rotation block with\naccompanying academic courses (these include but are not limited to [internal\nmedicine](/wiki/Internal_medicine \"Internal medicine\"),\n[pediatrics](/wiki/Pediatrics \"Pediatrics\"), [general\nsurgery](/wiki/General_surgery \"General surgery\"),\n[anaesthesiology,](/wiki/Anesthesia \"Anesthesia\")\n[orthopaedics](/wiki/Orthopaedics \"Orthopaedics\"), [gynaecology and\nobstetrics](/wiki/Gynaecology \"Gynaecology\"), [emergency\nmedicine](/wiki/Emergency_medicine \"Emergency medicine\"),\n[neurology](/wiki/Neurology \"Neurology\"), [psychiatry](/wiki/Psychiatry\n\"Psychiatry\"), [oncology](/wiki/Oncology \"Oncology\"), [urology](/wiki/Urology\n\"Urology\"), [physical medicine and\nrehabilitation](/wiki/Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation \"Physical medicine\nand rehabilitation\"), [ophthalmology](/wiki/Ophthalmology \"Ophthalmology\"),\nand [otorhinolaryngology](/wiki/Otorhinolaryngology \"Otorhinolaryngology\")).\nElective rotations are usually introduced in the fourth or fifth year, though\nas in the case of the non-elective rotations, _the hospitals the medical\nstudents may be placed in or apply to for a given rotation depend entirely on\nthe medical schools_. This is important in terms of the medical training,\ngiven the particular distinction of patients, pathologies, procedures, and\nskills seen and learned in private vs. public hospitals in Colombia. Most\nschools, however, have placements in both types of hospitals for many\nspecialties.\n\nThe final year of medical school in Colombia is referred to as the internship\nyear (\"internado\"). The internship year is usually divided into two semesters.\nThe first semester is made up of obligatory rotations that every student does\nthough in different orders, and the [medical\nintern](/wiki/Internship_\\(medicine\\) \"Internship \\(medicine\\)\") serves in 5-7\ndifferent specialties, typically including internal medicine, paediatrics,\ngeneral surgery, anaesthesiology, orthopaedics, gynaecology and obstetrics,\nand emergency medicine. The extent of the responsibilities of the intern\nvaries with the hospital, as does the level of supervision and teaching, but\ngenerally, medical interns in Colombia extensively take, write, and review\nclinical histories, answer and discuss referrals with their seniors, do daily\nprogress notes for the patients under their charge, participate in the service\nrounds, present and discuss patients at rounds, serve shifts, assist in\nsurgical procedures, and assist in general administrative tasks. Sometimes,\nthey are charged with ordering diagnostic testing, but, under Colombian law\nthey cannot prescribe medication as they are not graduate physicians. This, of\ncourse, are to be completed in addition to their academic responsibilities.\nThe second semester is made up of elective rotations, which can be at home or\nabroad, in the form of clerkships or observerships. A final graduation\nrequirement is to sit a standardized exam, the [State Exam for Quality in\nHigher Education](http://www.icfesinteractivo.gov.co/resultadosSaberPro/)\n(\"Examen de Estado de Calidad de la Educación Superior\" or ECAES, also known\nas SABER PRO) specific to medicine, which tests, for example, knowledge in\npublic health and primary care.\n\nAfter graduation, the physician is required to register with the [Colombian\nMinistry of Health](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/Paginas/default.aspx), in\norder to complete a year of [obligatory social\nservice](https://www.minsalud.gov.co/sites/rid/Lists/BibliotecaDigital/RIDE/VS/TH/abc-\nsso.pdf) (\"servicio social obligatorio\"), after which they qualify for a\nprofessional license to practice general medicine and apply for a medical\nresidency within Colombia. If, however, the student wishes to practice general\nmedicine abroad or continue onto their postgraduate studies, for example, they\ncan independently begin the appropriate application/equivalency process,\n_without_ doing their obligatory social service. In this case they would not\nbe licensed to practise medicine in Colombia and if they wish to do so, will\nhave to register with the Ministry of Health. N.B. If the graduate physician\ngets accepted immediately into a residency within Colombia in internal\nmedicine, paediatrics, family medicine, gynecology and obstetrics, general\nsurgery or anaesthesiology, they are allowed to complete a 6-month-long social\nservice _after_ their residency.\n\nIn contrast with most countries, residencies in Colombia are NOT paid\npositions, since one applies for the program through the university offering\nthe post, which requires a tuition. However, on [9th May,\n2017](http://www.eltiempo.com/vida/salud/pago-a-residentes-medicos-proyecto-\nde-ley-86294), legislation was formally introduced in Congress that would seek\nto regulate payment for medical residents, regulate their tuitions, and\nadvocate for their vacation time and working hours. As in other countries,\nlength of residency training depends upon the specialty chosen, and, following\nits completion, the physician may choose to apply for a fellowship\n(subspecialty) at home or abroad depending on the availability of their\ndesired training programs, or practice in their specialty.\n\n### El\nSalvador[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: El Salvador\")]\n\nThe Universidad de El Salvador (University of El Salvador) has a program of 8\nyears for students who want to study medicine. The first six years are\norganized in a two semesters fashion, the seventh year is used for a rotating\ninternship through the mayor specialty areas in a 10-week periods fashion\n(psychiatry and public health share a period) and the eighth year is\ndesignated for Social service in locations approved by the Ministry of Health\n(usually as attending physician in Community Health Centers or non-profit\norganizations). The graduates receive the degree of MD and must register in\nthe Public Health Superior Council(CSSP) to get the medical license and a\nregistered national number that allows them to prescribe barbiturates and\nother controlled drugs. In order to attend further studies (Surgery, Internal\nmedicine, G/OB, Pediatrics, Psychiatry), the students in the year of Social\nservice or graduates of any Salvadorian university must apply independently\nfor the residency to the hospital of choice; the preliminary selection process\nis based on the results of clinical knowledge tests, followed by psychiatric\nevaluations and interviews with the hospital medical and administrative staff.\nThe basic residencies mentioned above commonly last 3 years; at the last\ntrimester of the third year, the residents can apply to the position of Chief\nof residents (1 year) or follow further studies as resident (3 years) of a\nspecialty (for example:orthopedic surgery, urology, neurology,\nendocrinology...). No further studies are offered to the date; therefore,\nspecialist looking for training or practice in a specific area (For example: a\nneurosurgeon looking for specialty in endovascular neurosurgery, spine surgery\nor pediatric neurosurgery) must attend studies in other countries and apply\nfor such positions independently.\n\n### Guyana[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Guyana\")]\n\nIn Guyana the medical school is accredited by the National Accreditation\nCouncil of Guyana.

Many medical\nschools have additional requirements including [calculus](/wiki/Calculus\n\"Calculus\"), [genetics](/wiki/Genetics \"Genetics\"),\n[statistics](/wiki/Statistics \"Statistics\"), [biochemistry](/wiki/Biochemistry\n\"Biochemistry\"), [English](/wiki/English_studies \"English studies\"), and/or\n[humanities](/wiki/Humanities \"Humanities\") classes. In addition to meeting\nthe [pre-medical](/wiki/Pre-medical \"Pre-medical\") requirements, medical\nschool applicants must take and report their scores on the [MCAT](/wiki/MCAT\n\"MCAT\"), a [standardized test](/wiki/Standardized_test \"Standardized test\")\nthat measures a student's knowledge of the sciences and the English language.\nSome students apply for medical school following their third year of\nundergraduate education while others pursue advanced degrees or other careers\nprior to applying to medical school.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were over four hundred medical schools in the\nUnited States. By 1910, the number was reduced to one hundred and forty-eight\nmedical schools and by 1930 the number totaled only seventy-six. Many early\nmedical schools were criticized for not sufficiently preparing their students\nfor medical professions, leading to the creation of the [American Medical\nAssociation](/wiki/American_Medical_Association \"American Medical\nAssociation\") in 1847 for the purpose of self-regulation of the profession.\nAbraham Flexner (who in 1910 released the [Flexner\nreport](/wiki/Flexner_report \"Flexner report\") with the Carnegie Foundation),\nthe [Rockefeller Foundation](/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation \"Rockefeller\nFoundation\"), and the AMA are credited with laying the groundwork for what is\nnow known as the modern medical curriculum.[20] The restriction of the supply\nof physicians that resulted from the Flexner Report has been criticized by\nclassical economists as one of the principal factors in the increased prices\nrelative to quality observed in medicine over the past 100 years.[21]\n\nThe standard U.S. medical school curriculum is four years long. Traditionally,\nthe first two years are composed mainly of classroom basic science education,\nwhile the final two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings\nwhere students learn patient care firsthand. Today, clinical education is\nspread across all four years with the final year containing the most clinical\nrotation time. The [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices](/wiki/Centers_for_Medicare_and_Medicaid_Services \"Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services\") (CMS) of the [U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services](/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services \"U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\") (HHS) has published mandatory rules,\nobliging on all inpatient and outpatient teaching settings, laying down the\nguidelines for what medical students in the United States may do, if they have\nnot completed a clerkship or sub-internship. These rules apply to when they\nare in the clinical setting in school, not when they are, for example, helping\nstaff events or in other non-formal educational settings, even if they are\nhelping provide certain clinical services along with nurses and the\nsupervising physicians- for example, certain basic screening procedures. In\nthe formal clinical setting in school, they can only assist with certain\n[patient\nevaluation](/w/index.php?title=Patient_evaluation&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Patient evaluation \\(page does not exist\\)\") and management tasks, after the\n[vital signs](/wiki/Vital_signs \"Vital signs\"), [chief\ncomplaint](/wiki/Chief_complaint \"Chief complaint\") and the history of present\nillness have been discerned, but prior to the [physical\nexamination](/wiki/Physical_examination \"Physical examination\"): reviewing the\npatient's signs and symptoms in each body system, and then reviewing the\npatient's personal medical, genetic, family, educational/occupational, and\npsychosocial history. The student's supervising physician (or another\nphysician with supervisory privileges if the original doctor is no longer\navailable, for some reason) must be in the room during the student's work, and\nmust conduct this same assessment of the patient before performing the actual\nphysical examination, and after finishing and conferring with the student,\nwill review his or her notes and opinion, editing or correcting them if\nnecessary, and will also have his or her own professional notes; both must\nthen sign and date and I.D. the student's notes and the medical record. They\nmay observe, but not perform, physical examinations, surgeries, endoscopic or\nlaparoscopic procedures, radiological or nuclear medicine procedures, oncology\nsessions, and obstetrics. The patient must give consent for their presence and\nparticipation in his or her care, even at a teaching facility. Depending on\nthe time they have completed in school, their familiarity with the area of\nmedicine and the procedure, and the presence of their supervisor, and any\nothers needed, in the room or nearby, they may be allowed to conduct certain\nvery minor tests associated with the physical examination, such as simple\nvenipuncture blood draws, and electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms,\nfor learning and experience purposes, especially when there is no intern or\nresident available.\n\nUpon successful completion of medical school, students are granted the title\nof [Doctor of Medicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine \"Doctor of Medicine\") (M.D.)\nor [Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine\n\"Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine\") (D.O.).\n[Residency](/wiki/Residency_\\(medicine\\) \"Residency \\(medicine\\)\") training,\nwhich is a supervised training period of three to seven years (usually\nincorporating the 1st year internship)typically completed for specific areas\nof specialty. Physicians who sub-specialize or who desire more supervised\nexperience may complete a [fellowship](/wiki/Fellowship_\\(medicine\\)\n\"Fellowship \\(medicine\\)\"), which is an additional one to four years of\nsupervised training in their area of expertise.\n\nUpon completion of medical school in the United States, students transition\ninto residency programs through the National Resident Match Program (NRMP).\nEach year, approximately 16,000 US medical school students participate in the\nresidency match. An additional 18,000 independent applicants—former graduates\nof U.S. medical schools, U.S. osteopathic medical schools, U.S. podiatry\nstudents, Canadian students, and graduates of foreign medical schools—compete\nfor the approximately 25,000 available residency positions.[22]\n\nUnlike those in many other countries, US medical students typically finance\ntheir education with personal debt. In 1992, the average debt of a medical\ndoctor after residency was $25,000. For the class of 2009, the average debt of\na medical student is $157,990 and 25.1% of students had debt in excess of\n$200,000 (prior to residency).[23] For the past decade the cost of attendance\nhas increased 5-6% each year (roughly 1.6 to 2.1 times inflation).[24]\n\nLicensing of medical doctors in the United States is coordinated at the state\nlevel. Most states require that prospective licensees complete the following\nrequirements:\n\n  * Graduation from an accredited medical school granting the degree of D.O. or M.D. \n    * United States and Canada schools must be accredited by the [American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine](/wiki/American_Association_of_Colleges_of_Osteopathic_Medicine \"American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine\") or the [Liaison Committee on Medical Education](/wiki/Liaison_Committee_on_Medical_Education \"Liaison Committee on Medical Education\").\n    * Foreign medical school graduates generally must complete some training within the United States.\n  * Satisfactory completion of at least one year of an [AOA](/wiki/American_Osteopathic_Association \"American Osteopathic Association\")\\- or [ACGME](/wiki/Accreditation_Council_for_Graduate_Medical_Education \"Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education\")-approved residency.\n  * Passing the [United States Medical Licensing Examination](/wiki/United_States_Medical_Licensing_Examination \"United States Medical Licensing Examination\") or the [Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination](/wiki/Comprehensive_Osteopathic_Medical_Licensing_Examination \"Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination\") (USMLE, COMLEX, or simply \"the boards\"). USMLE and COMLEX both consist of four similar parts: \n    * Step or Level I is taken at the end of the second year of medical school and tests students' mastery of the basic sciences as they apply to clinical medicine.\n    * Step II Clinical Knowledge (CK) or Level II Cognitive Evaluation (CE) is taken during the fourth year of medical school and tests students' mastery of the management of ill patients.\n    * Step II Clinical Skills (CS) or Level II Performance Evaluation (PE) is taken during the fourth year of medical school and tests students' mastery of clinical skills using a series of standardized patient encounters.\n    * Step or Level III is taken after the first year of a residency program and tests physicians' ability to independently manage the care of patients.\n\n### Uruguay[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=24\n\"Edit section: Uruguay\")]\n\nThe [University of Montevideo](/wiki/University_of_Montevideo \"University of\nMontevideo\") in Uruguay is the oldest in Latin America, being public and free,\nco-governed by students, graduates and teachers.

As a result, various\nAustralian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with the MD to\nresolve the previous anomalous nomenclature.[25] With the introduction of the\nMaster's level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical\nresearch doctorates.

The following two years are spent\nstudying human organ systems and pathological processes in more detail as well\nas professional and communication development. Toward the end of the third\nyear, students begin direct contact with patients in hospital settings.\n\nThe clinical years begin fully at the beginning of year 4, where students\nrotate through various areas of general clinical medicine with rotation times\nvarying from between two and six weeks. Year 5 continues this pattern,\nfocusing more on specialized areas of medicine and surgery. Final medical\nschool exams (exit exams) are actually held at the end of year 5, which is\ndifferent from most other countries, where final exams are held near the very\nend of the medical degree. Final exams must be passed before the student is\nallowed to enter year 6[39].\n\nThe final year (Year 6) of medical school is known as the \"Trainee Intern\"\nyear, wherein a student is known as a \"Trainee Intern\" (commonly referred to\nin the hospitals as a \"T.I.\"). Trainee interns repeat most rotations\nundertaken in years 4 and 5 but at a higher level of involvement and\nresponsibility for patient care[40]. Trainee interns receive a stipend grant\nfrom the New Zealand government (not applicable for international students).\nAt the current time, this is $NZ 26,756/year (about $US 18,500)[41]. Trainee\ninterns have responsibility under supervision for the care of about one-third\nthe patient workload of a junior doctor. However, all prescriptions and most\nother orders (e.g., radiology requests and charting of IV fluids) made by\ntrainee interns must be countersigned by a registered doctor.\n\nNew Zealand medical schools currently award the degrees of [Bachelor of\nMedicine and Bachelor of Surgery](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Medicine \"Bachelor of\nMedicine\") (MBChB)[42].\n\nUpon completion of the 6th year, students go on to become \"House Officers,\"\nalso known as \"House Surgeons\" for 1–2 years where they rotate through\nspecialities in the first year and then begin to narrow down to what they'd\nlike to do for speciality training in the second year. After 2 years of house\nofficer work they apply to get into a training scheme and start to train\ntowards the speciality[43].\n\n### Pakistan[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: Pakistan\")]\n\nMain article: [Medical school in Pakistan](/wiki/Medical_school_in_Pakistan\n\"Medical school in Pakistan\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/%27Pakistan%27-KE_Med_Univ-\nSep_2016_%288%29.jpg/220px-%27Pakistan%27-KE_Med_Univ-\nSep_2016_%288%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:%27Pakistan%27-KE_Med_Univ-\nSep_2016_\\(8\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:%27Pakistan%27-KE_Med_Univ-Sep_2016_\\(8\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[King Edward Medical University](/wiki/King_Edward_Medical_University \"King\nEdward Medical University\"), fourth oldest medical school in South Asia\n\nIn [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan \"Pakistan\") a medical school is more often\nreferred to as a medical college.

The duration of\nbasic medical education is six years and the course leads to the degree of\nLicentiate of Medicine.\n\n### France[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=62\n\"Edit section: France\")]\n\nMain article: [Medical school in France](/wiki/Medical_school_in_France\n\"Medical school in France\")\n\nMedical studies in France are organized as follow:\n\nRight after graduating from High School with a\n[Baccalaureat](/wiki/Baccalaureat \"Baccalaureat\"), any student can register at\na university of medicine (there are about 30 of them throughout the country).\nAt the end of first year, an internal ranking examination takes place in each\nof these universities in order to implement the [numerus\nclausus](/wiki/Numerus_clausus \"Numerus clausus\"). First year consists mainly\nof theoretical classes such as [biophysics](/wiki/Biophysics \"Biophysics\") and\n[biochemistry](/wiki/Biochemistry \"Biochemistry\"), [anatomy](/wiki/Anatomy\n\"Anatomy\"), [ethics](/wiki/Ethics \"Ethics\") or [histology](/wiki/Histology\n\"Histology\"). Passing first year is commonly considered as challenging and\nrequires hard and continuous work. Each student can only try twice. For\nexample, the [Université René\nDescartes](/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes \"Université René\nDescartes\") welcomes about 2000 students in first year and only 300 after\nnumerus clausus.\n\nThe second and third year are usually mainly quite theoretical although the\nteachings are often accompanied by placements in the field (e.g. internships\nas nurses or in the emergency room, depending on the university).\n\nDuring 4th, 5th and 6th years, medical students get a special status called\n'Externe' (In some universities, such as Pierre et Marie Curie, the 'Externe'\nstatus is given starting in the 3rd year). They work as interns every morning\nat the hospital plus a few night shifts a month and study in the afternoon.\nEach internship lasts between 3 and 4 months and takes place in a different\ndepartment. Med students get 5 weeks off a year.\n\nAt the end of sixth year, they need to pass a national ranking exam, which\nwill determine their specialty. Indeed, the first student gets to choose\nfirst, then the second, etcetera. Usually students work pretty hard during 5th\nand 6th years in order to train properly for the national ranking exam. During\nthese years, actual practice at the hospital and some theoretical courses are\nmeant to balance the training. Such externs' average wage stands between 100\nand 300 euros a month.\n\nAfter that ranking exams, students can start as residents in the specialty\nthey have been able to pick. That is the point from which they also start\ngetting paid.\n\nTowards the end of the medical program, French [medical\nstudents](/wiki/Medical_students \"Medical students\") are provided with more\nresponsibilities and are required to defend a [thesis](/wiki/Thesis \"Thesis\").\nAt the conclusion of the thesis defense, French medical students receive a\nState Diploma of [Doctor of Medicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine \"Doctor of\nMedicine\") (MD) or \"Diplôme d'Etat de Doctorat en Medecine _for general\nmedicine. For those who are in speciality training will also receive_ a\nDiploma of Specialized Studies (DES= Diplôme d'Etudes Specialisees) _to mark\ntheir specialties. Some students may also receive a_ Diploma of Specialized\nComplementary Studies (DESC)= Diplôme d'Etudes Specialisees Complementaires\n_.[53]_\n\n### Germany[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=63\n\"Edit section: Germany\")]\n\nSee also: [List of medical schools in\nGermany](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_Europe#Germany \"List of medical\nschools in Europe\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/UniKlinik_%28Freiburg%29_4.jpg/220px-\nUniKlinik_%28Freiburg%29_4.jpg)](/wiki/File:UniKlinik_\\(Freiburg\\)_4.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:UniKlinik_\\(Freiburg\\)_4.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [University of Freiburg Faculty of\nMedicine](/wiki/University_of_Freiburg_Faculty_of_Medicine \"University of\nFreiburg Faculty of Medicine\")\n\nIn [Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\"), admission to medical schools is\ncurrently administered jointly by the _Stiftung für Hochschulzulassung_ (SfH),\na centralized federal organization, and the universities themselves. The most\nimportant criterion for admission is the [Numerus\nclausus](/wiki/Numerus_clausus \"Numerus clausus\"), the final [GPA](/wiki/GPA\n\"GPA\") scored by the applicant on the [Abitur](/wiki/Abitur \"Abitur\") (highest\nsecondary school diploma). However, in light of the recent gain in influence\nof medical schools in regards to applicant selection, additional criteria are\nbeing used to select students for admission. These criteria vary among medical\nfaculties and the final Abitur GPA is always a core indicator and strongly\ninfluences admission. Admission remains highly competitive. A very small\nnumber of slots per semester are reserved for selected applicants which\nalready hold a university degree (Zweitstudium) and for medical officer\ncandidates (Sanitätsoffizieranwärter).\n\nThe first two years of medical school consist of the so-called pre-clinical\nclasses. During this time, the students are instructed in the basic sciences\n(e.g. [physics](/wiki/Physics \"Physics\"), [chemistry](/wiki/Chemistry\n\"Chemistry\"), [biology](/wiki/Biology \"Biology\"), [anatomy](/wiki/Anatomy\n\"Anatomy\"), [physiology](/wiki/Physiology \"Physiology\"),\n[biochemistry](/wiki/Biochemistry \"Biochemistry\"), etc.) and must pass a\nfederal medical exam (_Erster Abschnitt der ärztlichen Prüfung_), administered\nnationally. Upon completion, the students advance to the clinical stage, where\nthey receive three years of training and education in the clinical subjects\n(e.g., [internal medicine](/wiki/Internal_medicine \"Internal medicine\"),\n[surgery](/wiki/Surgery \"Surgery\"), [obstetrics](/wiki/Obstetrics\n\"Obstetrics\") and [gynecology](/wiki/Gynecology \"Gynecology\"),\n[pediatrics](/wiki/Pediatrics \"Pediatrics\"), [pharmacology](/wiki/Pharmacology\n\"Pharmacology\"), [pathology](/wiki/Pathology \"Pathology\"), etc.). After these\nthree years, they have to pass the second federal medical exam (_Zweiter\nAbschnitt der ärztlichen Prüfung_) before continuing with the sixth and final\nyear. The last year of medical school consists of the so-called \"practical\nyear\" (_Praktisches Jahr, PJ)_. Students are required to spend three four-\nmonth clerkships, two of them in a hospital (internal medicine and surgery) as\nwell as one elective, which can be one of the other clinical subjects (e. g.\nfamily medicine, anesthesiology, neurology, pediatrics, radiology etc.).\n\nAfter at least six years of medical school, the students graduate with a final\nfederal medical exam (_Dritter Abschnitt der ärztlichen Prüfung_). Graduates\nreceive the license to practice medicine or dentistry and the professional\ntitle of [physician](/wiki/Physician \"Physician\") (_Arzt_) or\n[dentist](/wiki/Dentist \"Dentist\") (_Zahnarzt_). The academic degrees [Doctor\nof Medicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine \"Doctor of Medicine\") ([Dr.\nmed.](/wiki/Dr._med. \"Dr. med.\")) and [Doctor of dental\nMedicine](/wiki/Dental_degree \"Dental degree\") (Dr. med. dent.) are awarded if\nthe graduate has, in addition, successfully completed a scientific study and\ndissertation. It is a doctoral degree and therefore different from the MD or\nDDS degrees in the U.S., which as professional degrees are awarded after\npassing the final exams and do not require additional scientific work. Many\nmedical students opt to perform their thesis during their studies at medical\nschool, but only a fraction of them is able to finish the dissertation-process\nduring their studies. The requirements for getting a Dr. med. degree across\nthe board are not as hard as for the doctor in natural science (Dr. rer.\nnat.). Therefore, many critics advocate to adopt a system similar to that of\nthe Anglo-Saxon countries with an MD as a professional degree and a PhD\nshowing additional scientific qualification. If physicians wish to open up a\ndoctor's office, they are required to further complete\n[residency](/w/index.php?title=Residency_s_\\(medicine\\)&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Residency s \\(medicine\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\") in order to fulfill the\nfederal requirements of becoming\n[Facharzt](/w/index.php?title=Facharzt&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Facharzt \\(page\ndoes not exist\\)\") (specialized in a certain field of medicine like internal\nmedicine, surgery, pediatrics etc.). Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must\ncomplete both studies, medicine and dentistry, then afterwards specializing\nanother 5 years.\n\nThere are 36 medical faculties in Germany.\n\n### Greece[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=64\n\"Edit section: Greece\")]\n\nThere are seven medical schools in Greece. The most prominent one of them is\nthe [University of Athens](/wiki/University_of_Athens \"University of Athens\")\nMedical School.

Only the top 48 scores on the exam are granted admission each year.\nMedical school in Iceland takes 6 years to complete. Students receive a\n[cand.med.](/wiki/Cand.med. \"Cand.med.\") degree upon graduation. Following\nthis, Icelandic regulations require 12 months of clinical internship before\ngranting a full medical license.[54] This internship consists of internal\nmedicine (4 months), surgery (2 months), family medicine (3 months) and a\nthree-month elective period. Upon receiving a license to practice, a physician\ncan start specialist training, in Iceland or abroad.[55][56]\n\n### Ireland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=67\n\"Edit section: Ireland\")]\n\nSee also: [List of medical schools in\nIreland](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_Europe#Ireland \"List of medical\nschools in Europe\")\n\nThere are six medical schools in [Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic\nof Ireland\"). They are at [Trinity College\nDublin](/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin \"Trinity College Dublin\"), the [Royal\nCollege of Surgeons in Ireland](/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_in_Ireland\n\"Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\"), [University College\nDublin](/wiki/University_College_Dublin \"University College Dublin\"),\n[University College Cork](/wiki/University_College_Cork \"University College\nCork\"), [University of Limerick](/wiki/University_of_Limerick \"University of\nLimerick\") and the [National University of Ireland,\nGalway](/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland,_Galway \"National University of\nIreland, Galway\") (the [National University of\nIreland](/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland \"National University of\nIreland\") is the degree-awarding institution for all except the University of\nLimerick and Trinity College). Training lasts four, five or six years, with\nthe last two years in the affiliated teaching hospitals (UCD - St. Vincents\nUniversity Hospital, [Mater Misericordiae University\nHospital](/wiki/Mater_Misericordiae_University_Hospital \"Mater Misericordiae\nUniversity Hospital\")) (Trinity - [St. James's\nHospital](/wiki/St._James%27s_Hospital \"St. James's Hospital\"), [Adelaide and\nMeath Hospital](/wiki/Adelaide_and_Meath_Hospital \"Adelaide and Meath\nHospital\") incorporating the National Children's Hospital) (UCC - [Cork\nUniversity Hospital](/wiki/Cork_University_Hospital \"Cork University\nHospital\")) (RCSI - [Beaumont Hospital](/wiki/Beaumont_Hospital,_Dublin\n\"Beaumont Hospital, Dublin\"), [Connolly Hospital](/wiki/Connolly_Hospital\n\"Connolly Hospital\"), [Waterford Regional\nHospital](/wiki/Waterford_Regional_Hospital \"Waterford Regional Hospital\")).\n\nFor Programmes that are six years in length, entry is based on secondary\nschool qualifications[57]. Programmes that are four years in length require\nprevious university degrees[58]. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and\nthe University of Limerick were the first medical institutions to offer\n[Graduate Entry Medicine](/wiki/Graduate_Entry_Medicine \"Graduate Entry\nMedicine\") of four years in duration in the\n[Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\")[59]. This is now\nalso offered in University College Dublin and University College Cork. The\nNational University of Ireland, Galway also launched a graduate entry\nprogramme in 2010.\n\nMedical education is regulated by the Irish Medical Council, the statutory\nbody that is also responsible for maintaining a register of medical\npractitioners[60]. After graduation with the degrees of BM BS (Bachelor of\nMedicine and Bachelor of Surgery) or MB BCh BAO (Medicinae Baccalaureus,\nBaccalaureus in Chirurgia, Baccalaureus in Arte Obstetricia), a doctor is\nrequired to spend one year as an\n[intern](/wiki/Internship_\\(medicine\\)#Republic_of_Ireland \"Internship\n\\(medicine\\)\") under supervision before full registration is permitted.\nGraduates of the [Royal College of Surgeons in\nIreland](/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_in_Ireland \"Royal College of Surgeons\nin Ireland\") also receive the traditional \"Licenciate of the Royal Colleges of\nSurgeons and Physicians in Ireland\" (LRCP&SI), which was awarded before the\nRoyal College of Surgeons in Ireland became an Affiliate of the [National\nUniversity of Ireland](/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland \"National\nUniversity of Ireland\") and thus was allowed grant degrees, under the Medical\nPractitioners Act (1978).\n\n### Italy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=68\n\"Edit section: Italy\")]\n\nIn [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\"), the contents of the medical school admission\ntest is decided each year by the [Ministry of Education, Universities and\nResearch](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education,_Universities_and_Research \"Ministry of\nEducation, Universities and Research\") (MIUR) and consists of eighty questions\ndivided in five categories: [logics](/wiki/Logics \"Logics\") and \"general\neducation\" (\"_cultura generale_ \"), [mathematics](/wiki/Mathematics\n\"Mathematics\"), [physics](/wiki/Physics \"Physics\"),\n[chemistry](/wiki/Chemistry \"Chemistry\"), and [biology](/wiki/Biology\n\"Biology\"). Results are expressed in a national ranking.\n\nAs a general rule, all state-run medical schools in the country administer it\non the same day, whereas all privately run medical schools administer it on\nanother day, so that a candidate may take the test once for state-run schools\nand once for a private school of his or her choice, but no more.\n\nSome universities in Italy provide an international degree course in medicine\ntaught entirely in English for both Italian and non-Italian students. A number\nof these medical schools are at public universities, and have relatively low\ntuition fees compared to the English-speaking world, because the cost of the\nmedical education is subsidized by the state for both Italian and non-Italian\nstudents. These public medical schools include the [International Medical\nSchool](/wiki/International_Medical_School,_University_of_Milan \"International\nMedical School, University of Milan\") at the [University of\nMilan](/wiki/University_of_Milan \"University of Milan\"), the [University of\nPavia](/wiki/University_of_Pavia \"University of Pavia\"), [Rome \"La\nSapienza\"](/wiki/Sapienza_University_of_Rome \"Sapienza University of Rome\"),\n[Rome \"Tor Vergata\"](/wiki/University_of_Rome_Tor_Vergata \"University of Rome\nTor Vergata\"), [Naples Federico II](/wiki/University_of_Naples_Federico_II\n\"University of Naples Federico II\"), the [Second University of\nNaples](/wiki/Seconda_Universit%C3%A0_degli_Studi_di_Napoli \"Seconda\nUniversità degli Studi di Napoli\"), and the [University of\nBari](/wiki/University_of_Bari \"University of Bari\"). These universities\nrequire applicants to rank highly on the [International Medical Admissions\nTest](/wiki/International_Medical_Admissions_Test \"International Medical\nAdmissions Test\"). Italy also has private or parochial, more expensive\nEnglish-language medical schools such as [Vita-Salute San Raffaele\nUniversity](/wiki/Vita-Salute_San_Raffaele_University \"Vita-Salute San\nRaffaele University\") and [Humanitas University](/wiki/Humanitas_University\n\"Humanitas University\") in Milan, and at the [Università Cattolica del Sacro\nCuore](/wiki/Universit%C3%A0_Cattolica_del_Sacro_Cuore \"Università Cattolica\ndel Sacro Cuore\") [Rome](/wiki/Rome \"Rome\") campus.\n\nMedicine is one of the university faculties implementing [numerus\nclausus](/wiki/Numerus_clausus \"Numerus clausus\") (\"_numero chiuso_ \"): the\noverall number of medical students admitted every year is constant, as each\nmedical school is assigned a maximum number of new admission per year by MIUR.\n\nMedical school lasts 6 years (12 semesters). Traditionally, the first three\nyears are devoted to \"biological\" subjects (physics, chemistry, biology,\nbiochemistry, genetics, anatomy, physiology, immunology, pathophysiology,\nmicrobiology, and usually English language courses), whereas the later three\nyears are devoted to \"clinical\" subjects. However, most schools are\nincreasingly devoting the second semester of the third year to clinical\nsubjects and earlier patient contact. In most schools, there are about 36\nexams over the 6-year cycle, as well as a number of compulsory rotations and\nelective activities.\n\nAt the end of the cycle, students have to discuss a final thesis before a\nboard of professors; the subject of this thesis may be a review of academic\nliterature or an experimental work, and usually takes more than a year to\ncomplete, with most students beginning an _internato_ (internship) in the\nsubject of their choice in their fifth or sixth year. The title awarded at the\nend of the discussion ceremony is that of \"_Dottore Magistrale_ \", styled in\nEnglish as a [Doctor of Medicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine \"Doctor of\nMedicine\"), which in accordance with the [Bologna\nprocess](/wiki/Bologna_process \"Bologna process\") is comparable with a\n[master's degree](/wiki/Master%27s_degree \"Master's degree\") qualification or\na US MD.\n\nAfter graduating, new doctors must complete a three-month, unpaid, supervised\n_tirocinio post-lauream_ (\"post-degree placement\") consisting of two months in\ntheir university hospital (one month in a medical service and one in a\nsurgical service) as well as one month shadowing a [general\npractitioner](/wiki/General_practitioner \"General practitioner\"). After\ngetting a statement of successful completion of each month from their\nsupervisors, new doctors take the _esame di stato_ (\"state exame\") to obtain\nfull license to practise medicine. They will then have to register with one of\nthe branches of the _Ordine dei Medici_ (\"Order of Physicians\"), which are\nbased in each of the [Provinces of Italy](/wiki/Provinces_of_Italy \"Provinces\nof Italy\").\n\nRegistration makes new doctors legally able to practice medicine without\nsupervision. They will then have to choose between various career paths, each\nusually requiring a specific admission exam: most either choose to train as\ngeneral practitioner (a 3-year course run by each\n[Region](/wiki/Regions_of_Italy \"Regions of Italy\"), including both general\npractice and rotation at non-university hospitals), or to enter a _Scuola di\nSpecializzazione_ (\"specialty school\") at a university hospital 4-year or\n5-year course.\n\n### Lithuania[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=69\n\"Edit section: Lithuania\")]\n\n[Lithuania](/wiki/Lithuania \"Lithuania\") has two medical schools, in [Kaunas -\nLSMU](http://lsmuni.lt/en/) <http://lsmuni.lt/> and [Vilnius](/wiki/Vilnius\n\"Vilnius\"). Studies are of six years, of which the last year is a practical\nyear. All Lithuanian medical schools have ams in English. Since 1990, LSMU has\nbeen the Alma Mater of many international students and 550 full-time foreign\nstudents from 42 countries (mainly Israel, Germany, Finland, Norway, Spain,\nSweden, Lebanon, Poland, India, South Korea, Ireland and the United Kingdom)\nare currently enrolled here.\n\nThe Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) is the largest university-\ntype school in Lithuania preparing the health specialists. It unites the\nVeterinary Academy and the Medical Academy. LSMU traditions of studies and\nscientific work go back to the times of the Faculty of Medicine at Vytautas\nMagnus Universitythat was later turned into Kaunas Institute of Medicine.\n\nLSMU collaborates with more than 140 European, American and Asian universities\nfor study and research purposes.\n\nThe university is a member of numerous international organizations, such as\nthe European University Association (EUA), Association of Schools of Public\nHealth in The European Region (ASPHER), Association of Medical Schools in\nEurope (AMSE), Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE),\nOrganisation for PhD Education in Biomedicine and Health Sciences in the\nEuropean System (ORPHEUS), European Association of Establishments for\nVeterinary Education (EAEVE), World Veterinary Association, and more.\n\nLSMU is also a member of the World Health Organization (WHO), where it fulfils\nthe role of a collaboration centre for research and training in epidemiology,\nas well as for the prevention of cardiovascular and other chronic non-\ncommunicable diseases.\n\nThe study programmes at LSMU meet university education standards applied in EU\ncountries.\n\n### Netherlands and\nBelgium[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=70 \"Edit\nsection: Netherlands and Belgium\")]\n\nSee also: [List of medical schools in\nNetherlands](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools#Netherlands \"List of medical\nschools\") and [List of medical schools in\nBelgium](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_Europe#Belgium \"List of medical\nschools in Europe\")\n\nIn the [Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands \"Netherlands\") and\n[Belgium](/wiki/Belgium \"Belgium\"), medical students receive 6 years of\nuniversity education prior to their graduation.\n\nIn the Netherlands, students used to receive four years of preclinical\ntraining, followed by two years of clinical training (_co-assistentschappen_ ,\nor _co-schappen_ for short) in hospitals. However, for a number of medical\nschools this has recently changed to three years of preclinical training,\nfollowed by three years of clinical training. At least one medical faculty,\nthat of the [Utrecht University](/wiki/Utrecht_University \"Utrecht\nUniversity\"), clinical training already begins in the third year of medical\nschool. After 6 years, students graduate as _basisartsen_ (comparable to\n[Doctors of Medicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine \"Doctor of Medicine\")). As a\nresult of the [Bologna process](/wiki/Bologna_process \"Bologna process\"),\nmedical students in the Netherlands now receive a [bachelor's\ndegree](/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree \"Bachelor's degree\") after three years in\nmedical school and a [master's degree](/wiki/Master%27s_degree \"Master's\ndegree\") upon graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education\ndirectly after finishing the highest level of secondary school,\n[vwo](/wiki/Voorbereidend_wetenschappelijk_onderwijs \"Voorbereidend\nwetenschappelijk onderwijs\"); previous undergraduate education is not a\nprecondition for admittance.\n\nThe Belgian medical education is much more based on theoretical knowledge than\nthe Dutch system. In the first 3 years, which are very theoretical and lead to\na university [bachelor degree](/wiki/Bachelor_degree \"Bachelor degree\"),\ngeneral scientific courses are taken such as chemistry, biophysics,\nphysiology, biostatistics, anatomy, virology, etc. To enter the bachelor\ncourse in [Flanders](/wiki/Flanders \"Flanders\"), prospective students have to\npass an exam, as a result of the [numerus clausus](/wiki/Numerus_clausus\n\"Numerus clausus\"). In the [French-speaking\npart](/wiki/French_Community_of_Belgium \"French Community of Belgium\") of\nBelgium, only the best students that pass the first year of the bachelor\ncourse in medicine are admitted to the second and third year.\n\nAfter the bachelor courses, students are allowed to enter the 'master in\nmedicine' courses, which consist of 4 years of theoretical and clinical study.\nIn general, the first 2 master years are very theoretical and teach the\nstudents in human pathology, diseases, pharmacology. The third year is a year\nfull of internships in a wide range of specialities in different clinics. The\nseventh, final year serves as a kind of 'pre-specialization' year in which the\nstudents are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after\nmedical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates are\nliterally 'basic doctors' (_basisartsen_) who have yet to decide on a\nspecialty.\n\n### Norway[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=71\n\"Edit section: Norway\")]\n\nSee also: [List of medical schools in\nNorway](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools#Norway \"List of medical schools\")\n\nMedical education in Norway begins with a six- to six-and-a-half-year\nundergraduate university program. Admission requires a very high GPA from\nsecondary school - medicine consistently ranks as the most difficult\nuniversity programme to be admitted to in Norway. Furthermore, certain high\nschool subjects are required for admission (chemistry, mathematics and\nphysics). Upon completion, students are awarded a candidatus/candidata\nmedicinae (cand. med.) degree (corresponding to e.g. and MD in the USA) and\nmedical license. Those completing a research programme (Forskerlinje) get this\nadded to their degree. Following this, it is required a minimum of 18 months\nof internship (turnustjeneste) before applying on a specialist training in\nNorway. The internship consist of 6 months of internal medicine, 6 months of\nsurgery and 6 months family medicine. There are currently 43 recognized\nmedical specialties in Norway.\n\n### Poland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=72\n\"Edit section: Poland\")]\n\nSee also: [Category:Medical schools in\nPoland](/wiki/Category:Medical_schools_in_Poland \"Category:Medical schools in\nPoland\").\n\n### Portugal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=73\n\"Edit section: Portugal\")]\n\n  * [Universidade do Minho](/wiki/Universidade_do_Minho \"Universidade do Minho\"), Braga\n  * [Universidade do Algarve](/wiki/Universidade_do_Algarve \"Universidade do Algarve\"), Faro\n  * [Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra](/w/index.php?title=Faculdade_de_Medicina_da_Universidade_de_Coimbra&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra \\(page does not exist\\)\"), Coimbra\n  * [Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde](/w/index.php?title=Faculdade_de_Ci%C3%AAncias_da_Sa%C3%BAde&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde \\(page does not exist\\)\"), Covilhã\n  * [Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa](/w/index.php?title=Faculdade_de_Medicina_da_Universidade_de_Lisboa&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa \\(page does not exist\\)\"), Lisboa\n  * [Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Universidade Nova de Lisboa](/w/index.php?title=Faculdade_de_Ci%C3%AAncias_M%C3%A9dicas_da_Universidade_Nova_de_Lisboa&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Universidade Nova de Lisboa \\(page does not exist\\)\"), Lisboa\n  * [Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto](/w/index.php?title=Faculdade_de_Medicina_da_Universidade_do_Porto&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto \\(page does not exist\\)\"), Porto\n  * [Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute](/wiki/Abel_Salazar_Biomedical_Sciences_Institute \"Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute\"), Porto\n\n### Romania[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=74\n\"Edit section: Romania\")]\n\nSee also: [List of medical schools in\nRomania](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools#Romania \"List of medical schools\")\n\nIn Romania, medical school is a department of a medical university, which\ntypically includes Dentistry and Pharmacy departments as well. The name\n_facultate_ is used for departments in their universities too, but the\nMedicine departments distinguish themselves by the length of studies (6\nyears), which grants to graduates a status equivalent to that of a Master in\nScience. The Medicine departments are also marked by reduced flexibility - in\ntheory, a student in a regular university can take courses from different\ndepartments, like Chemistry and Geography (although it usually does not\nhappen, majors being clearly defined), while the medical universities do not\nhave any extra offers for their students, due to their specialization.\nAdmission to medical faculty is usually awarded by passing a Human Biology,\nOrganic Chemistry and/or Physics test. The program lasts 6 years, with first 2\nyears being preclinical and last 4 years being mostly clinical. After these\nsix years, one has to take the national licence exam (which consists of mostly\nclinically oriented questions, but some questions also deal with basic\nsciences) and has to write a thesis in any field he/she studied. Final award\nis _Doctor-Medic (titlu onorific)_ (shortened Dr.), which is not an academic\ndegree (similar to Germany). All graduates have to go through residency and\nspecialization exams after that in order to practice, although older graduates\nhad different requirements and training (e.g., clinical rotations similar to\nsub-internship) and might still be able to practice Family Medicine / General\nMedicine.\n\n### Russia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=75\n\"Edit section: Russia\")]\n\nSee also: [List_of_medical_schools_in_Europe §\nRussia](/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_Europe#Russia \"List of medical\nschools in Europe\")\n\nMedical schools in Russia offer a 6-year curriculum leading to award **Doctor\nof Medicine (MD)** \"Physician\".

Upon\nreceiving a license to practice, a physician is able to apply for a post to\nstart specialist training. There are currently 52 recognized medical\nspecialties in Sweden. The specialist training has a duration of minimum five\nyears, which upon completion grants formal qualification as a specialist.\n\n###\nSwitzerland[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=77\n\"Edit section: Switzerland\")]\n\nSee also: [Healthcare in Switzerland](/wiki/Healthcare_in_Switzerland\n\"Healthcare in Switzerland\")\n\nThere are five universities granting medical degrees in\n[Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland \"Switzerland\") (plus the [University of\nFribourg](/wiki/University_of_Fribourg \"University of Fribourg\") and the [ETH\nZurich](/wiki/ETH_Zurich \"ETH Zurich\") that provide the bachelor but not the\nmaster in medicine) and five [university hospitals](/wiki/University_hospital\n\"University hospital\"):\n\n  * Faculty of Medicine of the [University of Basel](/wiki/University_of_Basel \"University of Basel\") (see also [University Hospital of Basel](/wiki/University_Hospital_of_Basel \"University Hospital of Basel\"))\n  * Faculty of Medicine of the [University of Bern](/wiki/University_of_Bern \"University of Bern\") (see also [University Hospital of Bern](/wiki/University_Hospital_of_Bern \"University Hospital of Bern\"))\n  * Faculty of Medicine of the [University of Geneva](/wiki/University_of_Geneva \"University of Geneva\") (see also [University Hospital of Geneva](/wiki/University_Hospital_of_Geneva \"University Hospital of Geneva\"))\n  * Faculty of Biology and Medicine of the [University of Lausanne](/wiki/University_of_Lausanne \"University of Lausanne\") (see also [University Hospital of Lausanne](/wiki/University_Hospital_of_Lausanne \"University Hospital of Lausanne\"))\n  * Faculty of Medicine of the [University of Zürich](/wiki/University_of_Z%C3%BCrich \"University of Zürich\") (see also [University Hospital of Zürich](/wiki/University_Hospital_of_Z%C3%BCrich \"University Hospital of Zürich\"))\n  * Faculty of Health Sciences and Technology of the [ETH Zurich](/wiki/ETH_Zurich \"ETH Zurich\")\n\n### Turkey[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=78\n\"Edit section: Turkey\")]\n\nAll high school graduates who wish to pursue further education are required to\ntake an MCQ exam. The exam covers most of the high school and secondary school\ncurricula.\n\nA student who scores high enough gets a place in a faculty of his/her desire.\nEntrance to medical schools is extremely competitive, only very top scoring\nstudents are accepted to medical schools.\n\nMedical education takes six years, first three years being Pre-clinical years\nand the latter three being Clinical years. Right after graduation, graduates\ncan either work as GPs or take another exam called TUS (Medical Specialization\nExamination) to do residency in a particular department of a particular\nhospital.\n\nMost of the medical schools in Turkey are state schools but the number of\nprivate schools is on the rise. MCQ exam (YGS and LYS) scores required to be\naccepted to private medical schools are lower compared to their public\ncounterparts. The language of instruction is, in general, Turkish, but few\nuniversities also offer schools with English as the language of instruction.\nThis makes Turkey a popular place to study medicine for students from nearby\nareas like the Balkans, the Middle East, and to a lesser extent North Africa.\n\n### Ukraine[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Medical_school&action=edit&section=79\n\"Edit section: Ukraine\")]\n\nMedical degrees in Ukraine were offered only in institutions called medical\nuniversities, which are separate from traditional universities.

While the final outcomes of the qualifications themselves typically\nmeet the Expectations of the descriptor for higher education qualification at\n**level 7 (the UK master 's degree)**. These degrees may retain, for\nhistorical reasons, \"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\" and are\nabbreviated to MBChB or MBBS.[63]\n\nThere are currently [32\ninstitutions](/wiki/Medical_school_\\(United_Kingdom\\)#List_of_medical_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom\n\"Medical school \\(United Kingdom\\)\") that offer medical degrees in the United\nKingdom.[64] Completion of a medical degree in the UK results in the award of\nthe degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. Admission\nrequirements to the schools varies; most insist on solid A-Levels/Highers, a\ngood performance in an aptitude test such as the [UKCAT](/wiki/UKCAT \"UKCAT\"),\nthe [BMAT](/wiki/BMAT \"BMAT\") or the [GAMSAT](/wiki/GAMSAT \"GAMSAT\"), and\nusually an interview. As of 2008 the UK has approximately 8000 places for\nmedical students.[65]\n\nMethods of education range from courses that offer a problem-based learning\napproach (alongside lectures etc.), and others having a more traditional pre-\nclinical/clinical structure. Others combine several approaches in an\nintegrated approach.\n\nFollowing qualification, UK doctors enter a generalised two-year, competency-\nbased \"[foundation programme](/wiki/Modernising_Medical_Careers \"Modernising\nMedical Careers\")\", gaining full GMC ([General Medical\nCouncil](/wiki/General_Medical_Council \"General Medical Council\"))\nregistration at the end of foundation year one, and applying for specialist\ntraining (in medicine, surgery, general practice etc.) after foundation year\ntwo.\n\nMany medical schools offer intercalated degree programmes to allow students to\nfocus on an area of research outside their medical degree for a year.\n\nSome medical schools offer graduate entry programmes, which are four years\nlong. The name refers to the fact that students on these courses already have\na degree in another subject (i.e. they are graduates). Due to the shorter\nlength of the course, the timetable of these degrees are more intense and the\nholidays are shorter, compared to students on the 5-year course. In terms of\nentrance requirements, the 4-year degree restricts entry to those who already\nhold a first degree, and have previously worked in an area of healthcare. The\nfirst degree doesn't necessarily have to be a BSc degree (this is the criteria\nfor some of the medical schools), whereas other medical schools specify that\nthe prior degree has to be in a science subject. Competition for this course\nis fierce, with students having to also sit an entrance exam prior to being\nconsidered for an interview.\n\nMedical schools typically admit more students into undergraduate programmes\nthan into graduate entry programmes.\n\nMedical career grades of the [National Health Service](/wiki/National_Health_Service \"National Health Service\") | Year | Current ([Modernising Medical Careers](/wiki/Modernising_Medical_Careers \"Modernising Medical Careers\")) | Previous  \n---|---|---  \n1 | [Foundation doctor](/wiki/Foundation_doctor \"Foundation doctor\") (FY1 and FY2), 2 years | [Pre-registration house officer](/wiki/Pre-registration_house_officer \"Pre-registration house officer\") (PRHO), 1 year  \n2 | [Senior house officer](/wiki/Senior_house_officer \"Senior house officer\") (SHO),  \nminimum 2 years; often more  \n3 | [Specialty registrar](/wiki/Specialty_registrar \"Specialty registrar\"),  \ngeneral practice (GPST), 3 years | Specialty registrar,  \nhospital speciality (SpR), minimum 6 years  \n4 | [Specialist registrar](/wiki/Specialist_registrar \"Specialist registrar\"),  \n4–6 years | [GP](/wiki/General_Practitioner#United_Kingdom \"General Practitioner\") registrar, 1 year  \n5 | General practitioner,  \n4 years total time in training  \n6–8 | [General practitioner](/wiki/General_Practitioner#United_Kingdom \"General Practitioner\"),  \n5 years total time in training  \n9 | [Consultant](/wiki/Consultant_\\(medicine\\) \"Consultant \\(medicine\\)\"), minimum 8 years total time in training | Consultant, minimum 7–9 years total time in training  \nOptional | Training is competency based, times shown are a minimum.

Due to the limited intake a large number of students go abroad to study medicine, these include commonwealth countries, as well as in recent years Bangladesh, Russia and China. However private medical schools are in the process of being established at present with the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). Establishment of private medical schools have been opposed by the section of medical practitioners together with extremist student groups who does not willing to widening the access to medical education for the reasons best known to them. The total university undergraduate population in Sri Lanka is less than 27,000, of which few hundred students are admitted to the local medical faculties, annually. Thousands who qualifies for higher education have no other option, but to go abroad for higher studies, including for medicine. Annually Sri Lankan parents are spending over 1bn USD to provide education to their children overseas. A well established system to regulate both private and public universities including the medical faculties is required to ensure the quality and relevance of the higher education system and thereby to enable both the public and private institutions to compete for excellence, as in the case of many other countries. This would be \"the option\" available for the authorities to consider, if Sri Lanka is aspiring to become a regional hub for education and a knowledge exporting country. The Higher Education Minister and the University Grants Commission (UGC) were criticized by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) for offering degree awarding status to the South Asian Institute of Technology (SAITM), while turning blind eye to three other medical degree awarding institutions, recently established by the state; i.e. Rajarata, Eastern and the Defense university (Fee levying), whose quality and standers are certainly not above or in par with to that of SITAM. The dabble standards adopted by the relevant authorities are detrimental to the founding principles of the free education of this country to provide equal access to education to all. It should be noted the fact that \"education is not a privilege of a few, but a right of all\" who want to have access to education at all levels.\n  48. **Jump up ^** [\"GMOA Claims SAITM Is Sub-Standard | The Sunday Leader\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20130523094955/http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/09/18/gmoa-claims-saitm-is-sub-standard/).
