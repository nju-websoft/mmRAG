The result of\na long-standing [controversy](/wiki/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Origins\nof the American Civil War\") over [slavery](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States\n\"Slavery in the United States\"), war broke out in April 1861, when\n[Confederates](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of\nAmerica\") attacked [Fort Sumter](/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sumter \"Battle of Fort\nSumter\") in [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\"), shortly\nafter [Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\") was\n[inaugurated](/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Abraham_Lincoln \"First inauguration\nof Abraham Lincoln\"). The nationalists of the\n[Union](/wiki/Union_\\(American_Civil_War\\) \"Union \\(American Civil War\\)\")\nproclaimed loyalty to the U.S. Constitution. They faced\n[secessionists](/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States#Civil_War_era_political_and_legal_views_on_secession\n\"Secession in the United States\") of the [Confederate States of\nAmerica](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of America\"),\nwho advocated for states’ rights to perpetual slavery and its expansion in the\nAmericas.\n\nAmong the 34 [U.S. states](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S. state\") in February 1861,\nseven [Southern](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\") [slave\nstates](/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states \"Slave states and free states\")\nindividually declared their [secession](/wiki/Secession \"Secession\") from the\nU.S. to form the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy grew to\ninclude eleven states; it claimed two more [border\nstates](/wiki/Border_states_\\(American_Civil_War\\) \"Border states \\(American\nCivil War\\)\") ([Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky \"Kentucky\") and\n[Missouri](/wiki/Missouri \"Missouri\")), the [Indian\nTerritory](/wiki/Indian_Territory \"Indian Territory\"), and the southern\nportions of the Union's western territories of\n[Arizona](/wiki/Arizona_Territory \"Arizona Territory\") and [New\nMexico](/wiki/New_Mexico_Territory \"New Mexico Territory\"), which was\norganized and incorporated into the Confederacy as [Confederate\nArizona](/wiki/Confederate_Arizona \"Confederate Arizona\"). The Confederacy was\nnever diplomatically recognized by the [United States\ngovernment](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal government\nof the United States\"), nor was it recognized by any foreign country (although\nBritain and France granted it [belligerent status](/wiki/Belligerent\n\"Belligerent\")). The states that remained loyal, including the border states\nwhere slavery was legal, were known as the _Union_ or the _North_.\n\nThe North and South quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that\nfought mostly in the South over four years. During this time many innovations\nin warfare occurred, including the development and use of iron-clad ships,\nultimately changing naval strategy around the world. The Union finally won the\nwar when General [Robert E. Lee](/wiki/Robert_E._Lee \"Robert E. Lee\")\nsurrendered to General [Ulysses S. Grant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S.\nGrant\") at the [battle of Appomattox](/wiki/Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House\n\"Battle of Appomattox Court House\"), which triggered a series of\n[surrenders](/wiki/Surrender_\\(military\\) \"Surrender \\(military\\)\") by\nConfederate generals throughout the southern states. Four years of intense\ncombat left 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers dead, a higher number than the number\nof American military deaths in both World Wars, [Korea](/wiki/Korean_War\n\"Korean War\"), [Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\"),\n[Iraq](/wiki/Iraq_War \"Iraq War\") and\n[Afghanistan](/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_\\(2001%E2%80%93present\\) \"War in\nAfghanistan \\(2001–present\\)\") combined, and much of the South's\ninfrastructure was destroyed. The Confederacy\n[collapsed](/wiki/Conclusion_of_the_American_Civil_War#Capture_of_President_Davis_.28May_10.29\n\"Conclusion of the American Civil War\"), slavery [was\nabolished](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation Proclamation\"), and 4\nmillion slaves were freed. The [Reconstruction Era](/wiki/Reconstruction_Era\n\"Reconstruction Era\") (1863–1877) overlapped and followed the war, with the\nprocess of restoring national unity, strengthening the national government,\nand granting [civil rights](/wiki/Civil_rights \"Civil rights\") to freed slaves\nthroughout the country. The Civil War is arguably the most studied and\n[written about](/wiki/Bibliography_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Bibliography of\nthe American Civil War\") episode in [American\nhistory](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States \"History of the United States\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Prelude to war\n  * 2 Causes of secession\n    * 2.1 Slavery\n    * 2.2 Sectionalism\n    * 2.3 Protectionism\n    * 2.4 States' rights\n    * 2.5 Territorial crisis\n    * 2.6 National elections\n      * 2.6.1 Nationalism and honor\n      * 2.6.2 Lincoln's election\n  * 3 Outbreak of the war\n    * 3.1 Secession crisis\n    * 3.2 Battle of Fort Sumter\n    * 3.3 Attitude of the border states\n  * 4 War\n    * 4.1 Mobilization\n      * 4.1.1 Motivation\n      * 4.1.2 Prisoners\n    * 4.2 Naval war\n      * 4.2.1 Union blockade\n        * 4.2.1.1 Modern navy evolves\n        * 4.2.1.2 Blockade runners\n        * 4.2.1.3 Economic impact\n      * 4.2.2 Rivers\n    * 4.3 Eastern theater\n    * 4.4 Western theater\n    * 4.5 Trans-Mississippi\n    * 4.6 End of the war\n      * 4.6.1 Conquest of Virginia\n      * 4.6.2 Confederacy surrenders\n  * 5 Diplomacy\n  * 6 Union victory and aftermath\n    * 6.1 Results\n    * 6.2 Costs\n    * 6.3 Emancipation\n      * 6.3.1 Slavery as a war issue\n      * 6.3.2 Emancipation Proclamation\n    * 6.4 Texas v.

The Southern states viewed this as a violation of their\nconstitutional rights and as the first step in a plan to eventually abolish\nslavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82%\nmajority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in\nthe north, [Democrat](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic\nParty \\(United States\\)\") [Stephen A. Douglas](/wiki/Stephen_A._Douglas\n\"Stephen A. Douglas\")' votes were distributed nationally and [Constitutional\nUnionist](/wiki/Constitutional_Union_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Constitutional\nUnion Party \\(United States\\)\") [John\nBell](/wiki/John_Bell_\\(Tennessee_politician\\) \"John Bell \\(Tennessee\npolitician\\)\")'s votes centered in [Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee \"Tennessee\"),\n[Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky \"Kentucky\"), and [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia\n\"Virginia\"). The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a\n[plurality](/wiki/Plurality_\\(voting\\) \"Plurality \\(voting\\)\") of the popular\nvotes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally, so Lincoln was\nconstitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party\ncandidate to win the presidency. However, before [his\ninauguration](/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Abraham_Lincoln \"First inauguration\nof Abraham Lincoln\"), seven slave states with [cotton](/wiki/Cotton\n\"Cotton\")-based economies declared secession and formed the\n[Confederacy](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of\nAmerica\"). The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of\nslaves in their populations, a total of 49 percent.[16] The first seven with\nstate legislatures to resolve for secession included split majorities for\nunionists Douglas and Bell in [Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._state\\) \"Georgia\n\\(U.S. state\\)\") with 51% and [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\") with\n55%. [Alabama](/wiki/Alabama \"Alabama\") had voted 46% for those unionists,\n[Mississippi](/wiki/Mississippi \"Mississippi\") with 40%,\n[Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\") with 38%, [Texas](/wiki/Texas \"Texas\") with\n25%, and [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\") cast\n[Electoral College](/wiki/Electoral_College_\\(United_States\\) \"Electoral\nCollege \\(United States\\)\") votes without a popular vote for president.[17] Of\nthese, only Texas held a referendum on secession.\n\nEight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Outgoing\nDemocratic President [James Buchanan](/wiki/James_Buchanan \"James Buchanan\")\nand the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. [Lincoln's March\n4, 1861, inaugural address](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_first_inaugural_address\n\"Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address\") declared that his administration\nwould not initiate a [civil war](/wiki/Civil_war \"Civil war\"). Speaking\ndirectly to the \"Southern States\", he reaffirmed, \"I have no purpose, directly\nor indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the United\nStates where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have\nno inclination to do so.\"[18] After Confederate forces seized numerous federal\nforts within territory claimed by the Confederacy, efforts at compromise\nfailed and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that\n[European](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\") countries were so dependent on \"[King\nCotton](/wiki/King_Cotton \"King Cotton\")\" that they would intervene, but none\ndid, and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.\n\nHostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces [fired upon Fort\nSumter](/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sumter \"Battle of Fort Sumter\"). While in the\n[Western Theater](/wiki/Western_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Western\nTheater of the American Civil War\") the Union made significant permanent\ngains, in the [Eastern\nTheater](/wiki/Eastern_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Eastern Theater of\nthe American Civil War\"), the battle was inconclusive from 1861–1862. Lincoln\nissued the [Emancipation Proclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation\n\"Emancipation Proclamation\"), which made ending slavery a war goal.[19] To the\nwest, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much\nof their western armies, and seized [New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans \"New\nOrleans\"). The 1863 Union [Siege of Vicksburg](/wiki/Siege_of_Vicksburg \"Siege\nof Vicksburg\") split the Confederacy in two at the [Mississippi\nRiver](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\"). In 1863, [Robert E.\nLee](/wiki/Robert_E._Lee \"Robert E. Lee\")'s Confederate incursion north ended\nat the [Battle of Gettysburg](/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg \"Battle of\nGettysburg\"). Western successes led to [Ulysses S.\nGrant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S. Grant\")'s command of all Union\narmies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening [naval\nblockade](/wiki/Union_blockade \"Union blockade\") of Confederate ports, the\nUnion marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all\ndirections, leading to the [fall of Atlanta](/wiki/Fall_of_Atlanta \"Fall of\nAtlanta\") to [William T. Sherman](/wiki/William_T._Sherman \"William T.\nSherman\") and [his march to the sea](/wiki/Sherman%27s_march_to_the_sea\n\"Sherman's march to the sea\"). The last significant battles raged around the\n[Siege of Petersburg](/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg \"Siege of Petersburg\"). Lee's\nescape attempt ended with his [surrender at Appomattox Court\nHouse](/wiki/Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House \"Battle of Appomattox Court\nHouse\"), on April 9, 1865. While the military war was coming to an end, the\npolitical reintegration of the nation was to take another 12 years, known as\nthe [Reconstruction Era](/wiki/Reconstruction_Era \"Reconstruction Era\").\n\nThe American Civil War was one of the earliest true [industrial\nwars](/wiki/Industrial_warfare \"Industrial warfare\"). Railroads, the\n[telegraph](/wiki/Telegraph \"Telegraph\"), steamships and [iron-\nclad](/wiki/Ironclad_warship \"Ironclad warship\") ships, and mass-produced\nweapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories,\nmines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the\nimpact of industrialization in [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\"),\n[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") and subsequent conflicts. It\nremains the deadliest war in [American\nhistory](/wiki/History_of_the_United_States \"History of the United States\").\nFrom 1861 to 1865, it is estimated that 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers died[20],\nalong with an undetermined number of [civilians](/wiki/Civilian_casualties\n\"Civilian casualties\").[a] By one estimate, the war claimed the lives of 10\npercent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern\nwhite males aged 18–40.[22]\n\n## Causes of secession\n\nMain articles: [Origins of the American Civil\nWar](/wiki/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Origins of the American Civil\nWar\") and [Timeline of events leading to the American Civil\nWar](/wiki/Timeline_of_events_leading_to_the_American_Civil_War \"Timeline of\nevents leading to the American Civil War\")\n\nThe causes of the Civil War were complex and have been controversial since the\nwar began. James C. Bradford wrote that the issue has been further complicated\nby [historical revisionists](/wiki/Historical_revisionism \"Historical\nrevisionism\"), who have tried to offer a variety of reasons for the war.[23]\nSlavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the\n[1850s](/wiki/1850s_in_the_United_States \"1850s in the United States\"). The\n[Republican Party](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Republican Party\n\\(United States\\)\") was determined to prevent any spread of slavery, and many\nSouthern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate,\n[Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\"), won the [1860\nelection](/wiki/1860_U.S._Presidential_election \"1860 U.S. Presidential\nelection\"). After Lincoln won without carrying a single Southern state, many\n[Southern whites](/wiki/Definitions_of_whiteness_in_the_United_States\n\"Definitions of whiteness in the United States\") felt that disunion had become\ntheir only option, because they thought that they were losing representation,\nwhich would hamper their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and\npolicies.[24][25]\n\n### Slavery\n\n[![Map of U.S. showing two kinds of Union states, two phases of secession and\nterritories](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/US_Secession_map_1861.svg/250px-\nUS_Secession_map_1861.svg.png)](/wiki/File:US_Secession_map_1861.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:US_Secession_map_1861.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n**Status of the states, 1861**\n\nStates that seceded before April 15, 1861\n\nStates that seceded after April 15, 1861\n\nUnion states that permitted slavery\n\nUnion states that banned slavery\n\nTerritories\n\nSlavery was a major cause of disunion [26]. Although there were opposing views\neven in the Union States[27][28], most northern soldiers were largely\nindifferent on the subject of slavery [29], while Confederates fought the war,\nin large measure, to protect southern society, and slavery was an integral\npart of it.[30] From the anti-slavery perspective, the issue was primarily\nabout whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic evil that was\nincompatible with [republicanism](/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States\n\"Republicanism in the United States\"). The strategy of the anti-slavery forces\nwas containment—to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to\ngradual extinction.[31] The slave-holding interests in the South denounced\nthis strategy as infringing upon their Constitutional rights.[32] Southern\nwhites believed that the emancipation of slaves would destroy the South's\neconomy, due to the large amount of capital invested in slaves and fears of\nintegrating the ex-slave black population.[33]\n\nSlavery was illegal in much of the North, having been outlawed in the late\n18th and early 19th centuries. It was also fading in the border states and in\nSouthern cities, but it was expanding in the highly profitable cotton\ndistricts of the rural South and Southwest. Subsequent writers on the American\nCivil War looked to several factors explaining the geographic divide.\n\n### Sectionalism\n\n[Sectionalism](/wiki/Sectionalism \"Sectionalism\") refers to the different\neconomies, social structure, customs and political values of the North and\nSouth.[34][35] It increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which\nphased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built\nprosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture\nbased on slave labor, together with [subsistence\nfarming](/wiki/Subsistence_farming \"Subsistence farming\") for poor\n[freedmen](/wiki/Freedman \"Freedman\"). In the 1840s and 50s, the issue of\naccepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and\nmissionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the\nMethodist, Baptist and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and\nSouthern denominations.[36]\n\nHistorians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial\nNortheast and the agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now\ndisagree with the [economic determinism](/wiki/Economic_determinism \"Economic\ndeterminism\") of historian [Charles A. Beard](/wiki/Charles_A._Beard \"Charles\nA. Beard\") in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies\nwere largely complementary. While socially different, the sections\neconomically benefited each other.[37][38]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/NewOrleans1841AcrossRiver.jpg/300px-\nNewOrleans1841AcrossRiver.jpg)](/wiki/File:NewOrleans1841AcrossRiver.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NewOrleans1841AcrossRiver.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[New Orleans](/wiki/New_Orleans_in_the_American_Civil_War \"New Orleans in the\nAmerican Civil War\"), the largest cotton exporting port for New England and\nGreat Britain textile mills, shipping Mississippi River Valley goods from\nNorth, South and Border states\n\n### Protectionism\n\nHistorically, southern slave-holding states, because of their low cost manual\nlabor, had little perceived need for mechanization, and supported having the\nright to sell cotton and purchase manufactured goods from any nation. Northern\nstates, which had heavily invested in their still-nascent manufacturing, could\nnot compete with the full-fledged industries of Europe in offering high prices\nfor cotton imported from the South and low prices for manufactured exports in\nreturn. Thus, northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs and\nprotectionism while southern planters demanded free trade.[39]\n\nThe Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners, wrote the tariff laws in\nthe 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates so that the 1857 rates\nwere the lowest since 1816. The Whigs and Republicans complained because they\nfavored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth, and Republicans called\nfor an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were only\nenacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress.[40][41]\nThe tariff issue was and is sometimes cited–long after the war–by [Lost\nCause](/wiki/Lost_Cause \"Lost Cause\") historians and [neo-\nConfederate](/wiki/Neo-Confederate \"Neo-Confederate\") apologists. In 1860–61\nnone of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession raised the\ntariff issue.[42] Pamphleteers North and South rarely mentioned the\ntariff,[43] and when some did, for instance, [Matthew Fontaine\nMaury](/wiki/Matthew_Fontaine_Maury \"Matthew Fontaine Maury\")[44] and [John\nLothrop Motley](/wiki/John_Lothrop_Motley \"John Lothrop Motley\"),[45] they\nwere generally writing for a foreign audience.\n\n### States' rights\n\nThe South argued that each state had the right to secede—leave the Union—at\nany time, that the Constitution was a \"compact\" or agreement among the states.\nNortherners (including President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to\nthe will of the Founding Fathers who said they were setting up a perpetual\nunion.[46] Historian James McPherson writes concerning states' rights and\nother non-slavery explanations:\n\n> While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the [Sons of\n> Confederate Veterans](/wiki/Sons_of_Confederate_Veterans \"Sons of\n> Confederate Veterans\") and other Southern heritage groups, few professional\n> historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the\n> states'-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the\n> question, states' rights for what purpose? States' rights, or sovereignty,\n> was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal\n> more than a principle.[47]\n\n### Territorial crisis\n\nFurther information: [Slave and free states](/wiki/Slave_and_free_states\n\"Slave and free states\")\n\nBetween 1803 and 1854, the United States achieved a vast expansion of\nterritory through purchase, negotiation, and conquest. At first, the new\nstates carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned\nequally between slave and free states. It was over territories west of the\nMississippi that the proslavery and antislavery forces collided.[48]\n\nWith the conquest of northern [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\") west to\n[California](/wiki/Alta_California \"Alta California\") in 1848, slaveholding\ninterests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and\nCentral America as well.[49][50] Northern \"free soil\" interests vigorously\nsought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The [Compromise of\n1850](/wiki/Compromise_of_1850 \"Compromise of 1850\") over California balanced\na free soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement\nafter four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following\nCalifornia were all free: Minnesota (1858), Oregon (1859) and Kansas (1861).\nIn the southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery\nwestward again became explosive.[51] Both the South and the North drew the\nsame conclusion: \"The power to decide the question of slavery for the\nterritories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself.\"[52][53]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Stephen_Arnold_Douglas.jpg/150px-\nStephen_Arnold_Douglas.jpg)](/wiki/File:Stephen_Arnold_Douglas.jpg)\n\nSen.

John J. Crittenden, of the 1860 [Crittenden\nCompromise](/wiki/Crittenden_Compromise \"Crittenden Compromise\")\n\nBy 1860, four doctrines had emerged to answer the question of federal control\nin the territories, and they all claimed they were sanctioned by the\nConstitution, implicitly or explicitly.[54] The first of these \"conservative\"\ntheories, represented by the [Constitutional Union\nParty](/wiki/Constitutional_Union_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Constitutional\nUnion Party \\(United States\\)\"), argued that the [Missouri\nCompromise](/wiki/Missouri_Compromise \"Missouri Compromise\") apportionment of\nterritory north for free soil and south for slavery should become a\nConstitutional mandate. The [Crittenden\nCompromise](/wiki/Crittenden_Compromise \"Crittenden Compromise\") of 1860 was\nan expression of this view.[55]\n\nThe second doctrine of Congressional preeminence, championed by Abraham\nLincoln and the Republican Party, insisted that the Constitution did not bind\nlegislators to a policy of balance—that slavery could be excluded in a\nterritory as it was done in the [Northwest\nOrdinance](/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance \"Northwest Ordinance\") of 1787 at the\ndiscretion of Congress,[56] thus Congress could restrict human bondage, but\nnever establish it. The [Wilmot Proviso](/wiki/Wilmot_Proviso \"Wilmot\nProviso\") announced this position in 1846.[57]\n\nSenator [Stephen A. Douglas](/wiki/Stephen_A._Douglas \"Stephen A. Douglas\")\nproclaimed the doctrine of territorial or \"popular\" sovereignty—which asserted\nthat the settlers in a territory had the same rights as states in the Union to\nestablish or disestablish slavery as a purely local matter.[58] The\n[Kansas–Nebraska Act](/wiki/Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska_Act \"Kansas–Nebraska Act\")\nof 1854 legislated this doctrine.[59] In Kansas Territory, years of [pro and\nanti-slavery violence](/wiki/Bleeding_Kansas \"Bleeding Kansas\") and political\nconflict erupted; the congressional House of Representatives voted to admit\nKansas as a free state in early 1860, but its admission in the Senate was\ndelayed until January 1861, after the 1860 elections when southern senators\nbegan to leave.[60]\n\nThe fourth theory was advocated by Mississippi Senator [Jefferson\nDavis](/wiki/Jefferson_Davis \"Jefferson Davis\"),[61] one of state sovereignty\n(\"states' rights\"),[62] also known as the \"Calhoun doctrine\",[63] named after\nthe South Carolinian political theorist and statesman [John C.\nCalhoun](/wiki/John_Caldwell_Calhoun \"John Caldwell Calhoun\").[64] Rejecting\nthe arguments for federal authority or self-government, state sovereignty\nwould empower states to promote the expansion of slavery as part of the\nFederal Union under the U.S. Constitution.[65] \"States' rights\" was an\nideology formulated and applied as a means of advancing slave state interests\nthrough federal authority.[66] As historian Thomas L. Krannawitter points out,\nthe \"Southern demand for federal slave protection represented a demand for an\nunprecedented expansion of federal power.\"[67][68] These four doctrines\ncomprised the major ideologies presented to the American public on the matters\nof slavery, the territories and the U.S. Constitution prior to the 1860\npresidential election.[69]\n\n### National elections\n\nBeginning in the [American Revolution](/wiki/American_Revolution \"American\nRevolution\") and accelerating after the [War of 1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War\nof 1812\"), the people of the United States grew in the sense that their\ncountry was a national republic based on the belief that all people had\ninalienable political liberty and personal rights which could serve as an\nimportant example to the rest of the world. Previous regional independence\nmovements such as the [Greek revolt](/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence \"Greek\nWar of Independence\") in the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire \"Ottoman\nEmpire\"), the division and redivision of the Latin American political map, and\nthe British-French [Crimean triumph](/wiki/Crimean_War \"Crimean War\") leading\nto an interest in redrawing Europe along cultural differences, all conspired\nto make for a time of upheaval and uncertainty about the basis of the nation-\nstate.\n\nIn the world of 19th century self-made Americans, growing in prosperity,\npopulation and expanding westward, \"freedom\" could mean personal liberty or\nproperty rights. The unresolved difference would cause failure—first in their\npolitical institutions, then in their civil life together.\n\n#### Nationalism and honor\n\n[![Middle-aged man in a beard posed sitting in a suit, vest and\nbowtie](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Abraham_Lincoln_seated%2C_Feb_9%2C_1864.jpg/220px-\nAbraham_Lincoln_seated%2C_Feb_9%2C_1864.jpg)](/wiki/File:Abraham_Lincoln_seated,_Feb_9,_1864.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Abraham_Lincoln_seated,_Feb_9,_1864.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\")  \n16th U.S. President (1861–1865)\n\nNationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century, with famous\nspokesmen such as [Andrew Jackson](/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\") and\n[Daniel Webster](/wiki/Daniel_Webster \"Daniel Webster\"). While practically all\nNortherners supported the Union, Southerners were split between those loyal to\nthe entire United States (called \"unionists\") and those loyal primarily to the\nsouthern region and then the Confederacy.[70] [C. Vann\nWoodward](/wiki/C._Vann_Woodward \"C. Vann Woodward\") said of the latter group,\n\n> A great slave society ... had grown up and miraculously flourished in the\n> heart of a thoroughly bourgeois and partly puritanical republic. It had\n> renounced its bourgeois origins and elaborated and painfully rationalized\n> its institutional, legal, metaphysical, and religious defenses ... When the\n> crisis came it chose to fight. It proved to be the death struggle of a\n> society, which went down in ruins.[71]\n\nPerceived insults to Southern collective honor included the enormous\npopularity of _[Uncle Tom's Cabin](/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin \"Uncle Tom's\nCabin\")_ (1852)[72] and the actions of abolitionist [John\nBrown](/wiki/John_Brown_\\(abolitionist\\) \"John Brown \\(abolitionist\\)\") in\ntrying to incite a [slave\nrebellion](/wiki/John_Brown%27s_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry \"John Brown's raid on\nHarpers Ferry\") in 1859.[73]\n\nWhile the South moved towards a Southern nationalism, leaders in the North\nwere also becoming more nationally minded, and they rejected any notion of\nsplitting the Union. The Republican national electoral platform of 1860 warned\nthat Republicans regarded disunion as [treason](/wiki/Treason \"Treason\") and\nwould not tolerate it: \"We denounce those threats of disunion ... as denying\nthe vital principles of a free government, and as an avowal of contemplated\ntreason, which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to\nrebuke and forever silence.\"[74] The South ignored the warnings: Southerners\ndid not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union\ntogether.[75]\n\n#### Lincoln's election\n\nMain article: [United States presidential election,\n1860](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1860 \"United States\npresidential election, 1860\")\n\nThe election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for\nsecession.[76] Efforts at compromise, including the \"[Corwin\nAmendment](/wiki/Corwin_Amendment \"Corwin Amendment\")\" and the \"[Crittenden\nCompromise](/wiki/Crittenden_Compromise \"Crittenden Compromise\")\", failed.\nSouthern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and\nput it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already\nbecome a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as\na perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an\nincreasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven\nslave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.\n\nAccording to Lincoln, the people of the United States had shown that they can\nbe successful in _establishing_ and _administering_ a republic, but a third\nchallenge faced the nation, _maintaining_ the republic, based on the people's\nvote. The people must now show: \". . . successful maintenance [of the\nRepublic] against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it. It is now for\nthem to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election\ncan also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are the rightful and peaceful\nsuccessors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly and constitutionally\ndecided, there can be no successful appeal back to bullets; that there can be\nno successful appeal, except to ballots themselves, at succeeding elections.\nSuch will be a great lesson of peace; teaching men that what they cannot take\nby an election, neither can they take it by a war . . ..\" [77]\n\n## Outbreak of the war\n\n### Secession crisis\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Charleston_Mercury_Secession_Broadside%2C_1860.jpg/170px-\nCharleston_Mercury_Secession_Broadside%2C_1860.jpg)](/wiki/File:Charleston_Mercury_Secession_Broadside,_1860.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Charleston_Mercury_Secession_Broadside,_1860.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe first published imprint of secession\n\nThe election of Lincoln caused the legislature of South Carolina to call a\nstate convention to consider secession. Prior to the war, South Carolina did\nmore than any other Southern state to advance the notion that a state had the\nright to [nullify](/wiki/Nullification_\\(U.S._Constitution\\) \"Nullification\n\\(U.S. Constitution\\)\") federal laws and, even, secede from the United States.\nThe convention summoned unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and\nadopted the \"[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the\nSecession of South Carolina from the Federal\nUnion](/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Immediate_Causes_Which_Induce_and_Justify_the_Secession_of_South_Carolina_from_the_Federal_Union\n\"Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of\nSouth Carolina from the Federal Union\")\". It argued for states' rights for\nslave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in\nthe North in the form of opposition to the [Fugitive Slave\nAct](/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Law_of_1850 \"Fugitive Slave Law of 1850\"), claiming\nthat Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the\nConstitution. The \"cotton states\" of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia,\nLouisiana, and Texas followed suit, seceding in January and February 1861.\n\nAmong the ordinances of secession passed by the individual states, those of\nthree—Texas, Alabama, and Virginia—specifically mentioned the plight of the\n'slaveholding states' at the hands of northern abolitionists. The rest make no\nmention of the slavery issue, and are often brief announcements of the\ndissolution of ties by the legislatures.[78] However, at least four\nstates—South Carolina,[79] Mississippi,[80] Georgia,[81] and Texas[82] also\npassed lengthy and detailed explanations of their causes for secession, all of\nwhich laid the blame squarely on the movement to abolish slavery and that\nmovement's influence over the politics of the northern states. The southern\nstates believed slaveholding was a constitutional right because of the\n[Fugitive slave clause](/wiki/Fugitive_slave_clause \"Fugitive slave clause\")\nof the Constitution.\n\nThese states agreed to form a new federal government, the [Confederate States\nof America](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of\nAmerica\"), on February 4, 1861.[83] They took control of federal forts and\nother properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing\nPresident [James Buchanan](/wiki/James_Buchanan \"James Buchanan\"), whose term\nended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the [Dred Scott\ndecision](/wiki/Dred_Scott_decision \"Dred Scott decision\") was proof that the\nSouth had no reason for secession, and that the Union \"... was intended to be\nperpetual,\" but that, \"The power by force of arms to compel a State to remain\nin the Union,\" was not among the \"... enumerated powers granted to\nCongress.\"[84] One quarter of the U.S. Army—the entire garrison in Texas—was\nsurrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general, [David\nE. Twiggs](/wiki/David_E._Twiggs \"David E. Twiggs\"), who then joined the\nConfederacy.\n\nAs Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, Republicans\nwere able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern\nSenators before the war, including the [Morrill Tariff](/wiki/Morrill_Tariff\n\"Morrill Tariff\"), land grant colleges (the [Morrill Act](/wiki/Morrill_Land-\nGrant_Colleges_Act \"Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act\")), a [Homestead\nAct](/wiki/Homestead_Act \"Homestead Act\"), a transcontinental railroad (the\n[Pacific Railway Acts](/wiki/Pacific_Railway_Acts \"Pacific Railway\nActs\")),[85] the [National Banking Act](/wiki/National_Banking_Act \"National\nBanking Act\") and the authorization of [United States\nNotes](/wiki/United_States_Note \"United States Note\") by the Legal Tender Act\nof 1862. The [Revenue Act of 1861](/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1861 \"Revenue Act of\n1861\") introduced the [income tax](/wiki/Income_tax \"Income tax\") to help\nfinance the war.\n\nOn December 18, 1860, the [Crittenden Compromise](/wiki/Crittenden_Compromise\n\"Crittenden Compromise\") was proposed to re-establish the [Missouri\nCompromise](/wiki/Missouri_Compromise \"Missouri Compromise\") line by\nconstitutionally banning slavery in territories to the north of the line while\nguaranteeing it to the south. The adoption of this compromise likely would\nhave prevented the secession of every southern state apart from South\nCarolina, but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected it.[86] It was then\nproposed to hold a national referendum on the compromise. The Republicans\nagain rejected the idea, although a majority of both Northerners and\nSoutherners would have voted in favor of it.[87] A pre-war February [Peace\nConference of 1861](/wiki/Peace_Conference_of_1861 \"Peace Conference of 1861\")\nmet in Washington, proposing a solution similar to that of the Crittenden\ncompromise, it was rejected by Congress. The Republicans proposed an\n[alternative compromise](/wiki/Corwin_amendment \"Corwin amendment\") to not\ninterfere with slavery where it existed but the South regarded it as\ninsufficient. Nonetheless, the remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to\njoin the Confederacy following a two-to-one no-vote in Virginia's First\nSecessionist Convention on April 4, 1861.[88]\n\n[![Middle-aged man in a goatee posed standing in a suit, vest and\nbowtie](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/President-\nJefferson-Davis.jpg/170px-President-Jefferson-\nDavis.jpg)](/wiki/File:President-Jefferson-Davis.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:President-Jefferson-Davis.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Jefferson Davis](/wiki/Jefferson_Davis \"Jefferson Davis\"), [President of the\nConfederate States of\nAmerica](/wiki/President_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America \"President of\nthe Confederate States of America\") (1861–1865)\n\nOn March 4, 1861, [Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\")\nwas sworn in as President. In his [inaugural address](/wiki/Inauguration\n\"Inauguration\"), he argued that the Constitution was a _[more perfect\nunion](/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Preamble to the\nUnited States Constitution\")_ than the earlier [Articles of Confederation and\nPerpetual Union](/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation \"Articles of Confederation\"),\nthat it was a binding contract, and called any secession \"legally void\".[89]\nHe had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery\nwhere it existed, but said that he would use force to maintain possession of\nFederal property. The government would make no move to recover post offices,\nand if resisted, mail delivery would end at state lines. Where popular\nconditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law, U.S. Marshals\nand Judges would be withdrawn. No mention was made of bullion lost from U.S.\nmints in Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. In Lincoln's inaugural\naddress, he stated that it would be U.S. policy to only collect import duties\nat its ports; there could be no serious injury to the South to justify armed\nrevolution during his administration. His speech closed with a plea for\nrestoration of the bonds of union, famously calling on \"the mystic chords of\nmemory\" binding the two regions.[90]\n\nThe South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal\nproperties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln\nrejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the\nConfederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with\nit would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government.[91]\nSecretary of State [William Seward](/wiki/William_H._Seward \"William H.\nSeward\") who at that time saw himself as the real governor or \"prime minister\"\nbehind the throne of the inexperienced Lincoln, engaged in unauthorized and\nindirect negotiations that failed.[91] President Lincoln was determined to\nhold all remaining Union-occupied forts in the Confederacy, [Fort\nMonroe](/wiki/Fort_Monroe \"Fort Monroe\") in Virginia, in Florida, [Fort\nPickens](/wiki/Fort_Pickens \"Fort Pickens\"), [Fort\nJefferson](/wiki/Fort_Jefferson,_Florida \"Fort Jefferson, Florida\"), and [Fort\nTaylor](/wiki/Fort_Zachary_Taylor \"Fort Zachary Taylor\"), and in the cockpit\nof secession, Charleston, South Carolina's [Fort Sumter](/wiki/Fort_Sumter\n\"Fort Sumter\").\n\n### Battle of Fort Sumter\n\nMain article: [Battle of Fort Sumter](/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sumter \"Battle of\nFort Sumter\")\n\n[![Crowd surrounding an equestrian statue topped by a huge U.S.\nflag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Great_Meeting_Union_Square.jpg/300px-\nGreat_Meeting_Union_Square.jpg)](/wiki/File:Great_Meeting_Union_Square.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Great_Meeting_Union_Square.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMass meeting April 20, 1861, to support the Government at Washington's\nequestrian statue in [Union Square](/wiki/Union_Square_\\(New_York_City\\)\n\"Union Square \\(New York City\\)\") NYC\n\nFort Sumter was located in the middle of the harbor of\n[Charleston](/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina_in_the_American_Civil_War\n\"Charleston, South Carolina in the American Civil War\"), South Carolina, where\nthe U.S. fort's garrison had withdrawn to avoid incidents with local militias\nin the streets of the city. Unlike Buchanan, who allowed commanders to\nrelinquish possession to avoid bloodshed, Lincoln required Maj. Anderson to\nhold on until fired upon. Jefferson Davis ordered the surrender of the fort.\nAnderson gave a conditional reply that the Confederate government rejected,\nand Davis ordered [P. G. T. Beauregard](/wiki/P._G._T._Beauregard \"P. G.

Historian [Allan Nevins](/wiki/Allan_Nevins \"Allan Nevins\") said:\n\n    The thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment. ... Anger swept the land. From every side came news of mass meetings, speeches, resolutions, tenders of business support, the muster of companies and regiments, the determined action of governors and legislatures.\"[92][93]\n\nHowever, much of the North's attitude was based on the false belief that only\na minority of Southerners were actually in favor of secession and that there\nwere large numbers of southern Unionists that could be counted on. Had\nNortherners realized that most Southerners really did favor secession, they\nmight have hesitated at attempting the enormous task of conquering a united\nSouth.[94]\n\nLincoln called on all the states to send forces to recapture the fort and\nother federal properties. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so\nfar, Lincoln called for only [75,000 volunteers](/wiki/75,000_volunteers\n\"75,000 volunteers\") for 90 days.[95] The governor of Massachusetts had state\nregiments on trains headed south the next day.

Maryland's legislature voted\noverwhelmingly (53–13) to stay in the Union, but also rejected hostilities\nwith its southern neighbors, voting to close Maryland's rail lines to prevent\nthem from being used for war.[100] Lincoln responded by establishing [martial\nlaw](/wiki/Martial_law \"Martial law\"), and unilaterally suspending [habeas\ncorpus](/wiki/Habeas_corpus \"Habeas corpus\"), in Maryland, along with sending\nin militia units from the North.[101] Lincoln rapidly took control of Maryland\nand the District of Columbia, by seizing many prominent figures, including\narresting 1/3 of the members of the [Maryland General\nAssembly](/wiki/Maryland_General_Assembly \"Maryland General Assembly\") on the\nday it reconvened.[100][102] All were held without trial, ignoring a ruling by\nthe Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court [Roger Taney](/wiki/Roger_Taney\n\"Roger Taney\"), a Maryland native, that only Congress (and not the president)\ncould suspend habeas corpus ([Ex parte Merryman](/wiki/Ex_parte_Merryman \"Ex\nparte Merryman\")). Indeed, federal troops imprisoned a prominent Baltimore\nnewspaper editor, [Frank Key Howard](/wiki/Frank_Key_Howard \"Frank Key\nHoward\"), Francis Scott Key's grandson, after he criticized Lincoln in an\neditorial for ignoring the Supreme Court Chief Justice's ruling.[103]\n\nIn Missouri, an [elected\nconvention](/wiki/Missouri_Constitutional_Convention_\\(1861%E2%80%9363\\)\n\"Missouri Constitutional Convention \\(1861–63\\)\") on secession voted\ndecisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor\n[Claiborne F. Jackson](/wiki/Claiborne_Fox_Jackson \"Claiborne Fox Jackson\")\ncalled out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General\n[Nathaniel Lyon](/wiki/Nathaniel_Lyon \"Nathaniel Lyon\"), who chased the\ngovernor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the\nstate. (_See also:[Missouri secession](/wiki/Missouri_secession \"Missouri\nsecession\")_). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened\nand took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri.[104]\n\nKentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When\nConfederate forces entered the state in September 1861, neutrality ended and\nthe state reaffirmed its Union status, while trying to maintain slavery.\nDuring a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers\norganized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained\nrecognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile\nand never controlled Kentucky.[105]\n\nAfter Virginia's secession, a [Unionist\ngovernment](/wiki/Restored_Government_of_Virginia \"Restored Government of\nVirginia\") in [Wheeling](/wiki/Wheeling,_West_Virginia \"Wheeling, West\nVirginia\") asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on\nOctober 24, 1861.

In his book _The American Civil War_ , John\nKeegan writes that \"The American Civil War was to prove one of the most\nferocious wars ever fought\". Without geographic objectives, the only target\nfor each side was the enemy's soldier.[112]\n\n### Mobilization\n\nAs the first seven states began organizing a Confederacy in Montgomery, the\nentire U.S. army numbered 16,000. However, Northern governors had begun to\nmobilize their militias.[113] The Confederate Congress authorized the new\nnation up to 100,000 troops sent by governors as early as February. By May,\nJefferson Davis was pushing for 100,000 men under arms for one year or the\nduration, and that was answered in kind by the U.S. Congress.[114]\n\nIn the first year of the war, both sides had far more volunteers than they\ncould effectively train and equip. After the initial enthusiasm faded,\nreliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to\njoin was not enough. Both sides used a draft\nlaw—[conscription](/wiki/Conscription \"Conscription\")—as a device to encourage\nor force volunteering; relatively few were actually drafted and served. The\nConfederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35;\noverseers of slaves, government officials, and clergymen were exempt.[115] The\nU.S. Congress followed in July, authorizing a militia draft within a state\nwhen it could not meet its quota with volunteers. European\n[immigrants](/wiki/History_of_Immigration_to_the_United_States#Immigration_1790_to_1849\n\"History of Immigration to the United States\") joined the [Union\nArmy](/wiki/Union_Army \"Union Army\") in large numbers, including 177,000 born\nin Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland.[116]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Union_soldiers_entrenched_along_the_west_bank_of_the_Rappahannock_River_at_Fredericksburg%2C_Virginia_%28111-B-157%29.jpg/235px-\nUnion_soldiers_entrenched_along_the_west_bank_of_the_Rappahannock_River_at_Fredericksburg%2C_Virginia_%28111-B-157%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Union_soldiers_entrenched_along_the_west_bank_of_the_Rappahannock_River_at_Fredericksburg,_Virginia_\\(111-B-157\\).jpg)\n\nUnion soldiers before Marye's Heights, [Second\nFredericksburg](/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Fredericksburg \"Second Battle of\nFredericksburg\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Conf_dead_chancellorsville_edit1.jpg/180px-\nConf_dead_chancellorsville_edit1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Conf_dead_chancellorsville_edit1.jpg)\n\nConfederate dead overrun at Marye's Heights, reoccupied next day May 4, 1863\n\nWhen the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in January 1863, ex-slaves\nwere energetically recruited by the states, and used to meet the state quotas.\nStates and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white\nvolunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863. Men selected in the\ndraft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money.\nMany eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted.\nFamilies used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the\narmy and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance\nto the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great [draft riot in New York\nCity in July 1863](/wiki/New_York_Draft_Riots \"New York Draft Riots\") involved\nIrish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the vote of the\n[city's Democratic political machine](/wiki/Tammany_Hall \"Tammany Hall\"), not\nrealizing it made them liable for the draft.[117] Of the 168,649 men procured\nfor the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663\nwho had their personal services conscripted.[118]\n\nIn both the North and South, the draft laws were highly unpopular. In the\nNorth, some 120,000 men evaded conscription, many of them fleeing to Canada,\nand another 280,000 soldiers deserted during the war.[119] At least 100,000\nSoutherners deserted, or about 10 percent. In the South, many men deserted\ntemporarily to take care of their distressed families, then returned to their\nunits.[120] In the North, \"bounty jumpers\" enlisted to get the generous bonus,\ndeserted, then went back to a second recruiting station under a different name\nto sign up again for a second bonus; 141 were caught and executed.[121]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/NYRiot.jpg/170px-\nNYRiot.jpg)](/wiki/File:NYRiot.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NYRiot.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nRioters attacking a building during the [New York anti-draft\nriots](/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots \"New York City draft riots\") of 1863\n\nFrom a tiny frontier force in 1860, the Union and Confederate armies had grown\ninto the \"largest and most efficient armies in the world\" within a few years.\nEuropean observers at the time dismissed them as amateur and unprofessional,\nbut British historian [John Keegan](/wiki/John_Keegan \"John Keegan\")'s\nassessment is that each outmatched the French, Prussian and Russian armies of\nthe time, and but for the Atlantic, would have threatened any of them with\ndefeat.[122]\n\n#### Motivation\n\nPerman and Taylor (2010) say that historians are of two minds on why millions\nof men seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years:\n\n> Some historians emphasize that Civil War soldiers were driven by political\n> ideology, holding firm beliefs about the importance of liberty, Union, or\n> state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others\n> point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of\n> one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when\n> fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that no matter what a\n> soldier thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat\n> affected him profoundly and sometimes altered his reasons for continuing the\n> fight.[123]\n\n#### Prisoners\n\nMain article: [American Civil War prison\ncamps](/wiki/American_Civil_War_prison_camps \"American Civil War prison\ncamps\")\n\nAt the start of the civil war, a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed\nnot to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held\nin camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed to perform\nany military duties.[124] The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the\nConfederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. After that, about 56,000 of\nthe 409,000 POWs died in prisons during the war, accounting for nearly 10\npercent of the conflict's fatalities.[125]\n\n### Naval war\n\nThe small [U.S. Navy](/wiki/Union_Navy \"Union Navy\") of 1861 was rapidly\nenlarged to 6,000 officers and 45,000 men in 1865, with 671 vessels, having a\ntonnage of 510,396.[126][127] Its mission was to blockade Confederate ports,\ntake control of the river system, defend against Confederate raiders on the\nhigh seas, and be ready for a possible war with the British [Royal\nNavy](/wiki/Royal_Navy \"Royal Navy\").[128] Meanwhile, the main riverine war\nwas fought in the West, where a series of major rivers gave access to the\nConfederate heartland, if the U.S. Navy could take control. In the East, the\nNavy supplied and moved army forces about, and occasionally shelled\nConfederate installations.\n\n#### Union blockade\n\nMain article: [Union blockade](/wiki/Union_blockade \"Union blockade\")\n\n[![A cartoon map of the South surrounded by a\nsnake.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Scott-\nanaconda.jpg/330px-Scott-anaconda.jpg)](/wiki/File:Scott-anaconda.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Scott-anaconda.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGeneral Scott's \"[Anaconda Plan](/wiki/Anaconda_Plan \"Anaconda Plan\")\" 1861\\.\nTightening naval blockade, forcing rebels out of Missouri along the\nMississippi River, Kentucky Unionists sit on the fence, idled cotton industry\nillustrated in Georgia.\n\nBy early 1861, General [Winfield Scott](/wiki/Winfield_Scott \"Winfield Scott\")\nhad devised the [Anaconda Plan](/wiki/Anaconda_Plan \"Anaconda Plan\") to win\nthe war with as little bloodshed as possible.[129] Scott argued that a Union\nblockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy. Lincoln\nadopted parts of the plan, but he overruled Scott's caution about 90-day\nvolunteers. Public opinion, however, demanded an immediate attack by the army\nto capture Richmond.[130]\n\nIn April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports;\ncommercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended. The South\nblundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was\neffective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. \"King\nCotton\" was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its\ncotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads\nthat moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and\nCharleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern\nports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.[131]\n\n##### Modern navy evolves\n\nThe Civil War occurred during the early stages of the industrial revolution\nand subsequently many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably\nthe advent of the [ironclad warship](/wiki/Ironclad_warship \"Ironclad\nwarship\"). It began when the Confederacy, knowing they had to meet or match\nthe Union's naval superiority, responded to the Union blockade by building or\nconverting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating\nbatteries.[132] Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with\nram bows, creating \"ram fever\" among Union squadrons wherever they threatened.\nBut in the face of overwhelming Union superiority and the Union's own ironclad\nwarships, they were unsuccessful.[133]\n\nThe Confederacy experimented with a [submarine](/wiki/CSS_Hunley \"CSS\nHunley\"), which did not work well,[134] and with building an ironclad ship,\nthe [CSS _Virginia_](/wiki/CSS_Virginia \"CSS Virginia\"), which was based on\nrebuilding a sunken Union ship, the [_Merrimack_](/wiki/USS_Merrimack_\\(1855\\)\n\"USS Merrimack \\(1855\\)\"). On its first foray on March 8, 1862, the _Virginia_\ninflicted significant damage to the Union's wooden fleet, but the next day the\nfirst Union ironclad, the [USS _Monitor_](/wiki/USS_Monitor \"USS Monitor\"),\narrived to challenge it in the [Chesapeake Bay](/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay\n\"Chesapeake Bay\"). The resulting three hour [battle between the\nIronclads](/wiki/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads \"Battle of Hampton Roads\") was a\ndraw, but it marked the worldwide transition to ironclad warships.[135] Not\nlong after the battle the Confederacy was forced to scuttle the _Virginia_ to\nprevent its capture, while the Union built many copies of the _Monitor_.\nLacking the technology and infrastructure to build effective warships, the\nConfederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain.[136]\n\n##### Blockade runners\n\nMain article: [Blockade runners of the American Civil\nWar](/wiki/Blockade_runners_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Blockade runners of the\nAmerican Civil War\")\n\nBritish investors built small, fast, steam-driven [blockade\nrunners](/wiki/Blockade_runners_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Blockade runners of\nthe American Civil War\") that traded arms and luxuries brought in from Britain\nthrough Bermuda, Cuba, and the Bahamas in return for high-priced cotton. Many\nof the ships were designed for speed and were so small that only a small\namount of cotton went out.[137] When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner,\nthe ship and cargo were condemned as a [Prize of war](/wiki/Prize_of_war\n\"Prize of war\") and sold, with the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the\ncaptured crewmen were mostly British and they were simply released.[138] The\nSouthern economy nearly collapsed during the war. There were multiple reasons\nfor this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the\nfailure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers,\nforaging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by\nConfederate armies. Most historians agree that the blockade was a major factor\nin ruining the Confederate economy, however, Wise argues that the blockade\nrunners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting\nfor additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead,\nblankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.[139]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/First_Charleston_Harbor.jpg/260px-\nFirst_Charleston_Harbor.jpg)](/wiki/File:First_Charleston_Harbor.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:First_Charleston_Harbor.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGunline of nine Union ironclads. [South Atlantic Blockading\nSquadron](/wiki/Union_blockade#South_Atlantic_Blockading_Squadron \"Union\nblockade\") off Charleston. Continuous blockade of all major ports was\nsustained by North's overwhelming war production.\n\n##### Economic impact\n\nSurdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined\nthe Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the\nentire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union\ntraders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports\nwere scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.[140] The measure\nof the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the\nthousands that never tried it. Merchant ships owned in Europe could not get\ninsurance and were too slow to evade the blockade; they simply stopped calling\nat Confederate ports.[141]\n\nTo fight an offensive war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain,\nconverted them to warships, and raided American merchant ships in the Atlantic\nand Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag\nvirtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were\nreflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.[133] After the war,\nthe U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the\nU.S. $15 million in 1871.[142]\n\n#### Rivers\n\nThe 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:[143]\n\n  1. McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.\n  2. Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.\n  3. The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.\n  4. The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg/320px-\nNavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg)](/wiki/File:NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nClashes on the rivers were melees of [ironclads](/wiki/Ironclads \"Ironclads\"),\n[cottonclads](/wiki/Cottonclad_warship \"Cottonclad warship\"),\n[gunboats](/wiki/Gunboats \"Gunboats\") and rams, complicated by torpedoes and\nby [fire rafts](/wiki/Fire_ship \"Fire ship\").\n\n[Ulysses Grant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S.

The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat\nand the Union took control of western Kentucky in March 1862.[144]\n\nIn addition to ocean-going warships coming up the Mississippi, the Union Navy\nused timberclads, tinclads, and armored gunboats. Shipyards at Cairo,\nIllinois, and St. Louis built new boats or modified steamboats for\naction.[145] They took control of the Red, Tennessee, Cumberland, Mississippi,\nand Ohio rivers after victories at [Fort Henry](/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Henry\n\"Battle of Fort Henry\") (February 6, 1862) and [Fort\nDonelson](/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Donelson \"Battle of Fort Donelson\") (February\n11 to 16, 1862), and supplied Grant's forces as he moved into Tennessee. At\n[Shiloh](/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh \"Battle of Shiloh\") (Pittsburg Landing), in\nTennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed\nUnion forces against the river as night fell. Overnight, the Navy landed\nadditional reinforcements, and Grant counter-attacked. Grant and the Union won\na decisive victory—the first battle with the high casualty rates that would\nrepeat over and over.[146] [Memphis fell to Union\nforces](/wiki/Battle_of_Memphis \"Battle of Memphis\") on June 6, 1862, and\nbecame a key base for further advances south along the Mississippi River. On\nApril 24, 1862, U.S. Naval forces under [Farragut](/wiki/David_Farragut \"David\nFarragut\") ran past Confederate defenses south of New Orleans. Confederate\nforces abandoned the city, giving the Union a critical anchor in the deep\nSouth.[147]\n\nNaval forces assisted Grant in the long, complex [Vicksburg\nCampaign](/wiki/Vicksburg_Campaign \"Vicksburg Campaign\") that resulted in the\nConfederates surrendering at [Vicksburg,\nMississippi](/wiki/Vicksburg,_Mississippi \"Vicksburg, Mississippi\") in July\n1863, and in the Union fully controlling the Mississippi River soon\nafter.[148]\n\n### Eastern theater\n\nFor more details on this topic, see [Eastern Theater of the American Civil\nWar](/wiki/Eastern_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Eastern Theater of the\nAmerican Civil War\").\n\nIn one of the first highly visible battles, a march by Union troops under the\ncommand of [Maj.

Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's\n23,000).[160] However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's\nretreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the\nWestern Theater for new leadership.

The\nUnion army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles,\nnotably at the [Wilderness](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Wilderness \"Battle of the\nWilderness\"), [Spotsylvania](/wiki/Battle_of_Spotsylvania_Court_House \"Battle\nof Spotsylvania Court House\"), and [Cold Harbor](/wiki/Battle_of_Cold_Harbor\n\"Battle of Cold Harbor\"). These battles resulted in heavy losses on both\nsides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. An attempt to\noutflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the\n[Bermuda Hundred](/wiki/Bermuda_Hundred_Campaign \"Bermuda Hundred Campaign\")\nriver bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what\nthey had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals,\nGrant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing\nLee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for\nan attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [James\nRiver](/wiki/James_River \"James River\") and began the protracted [Siege of\nPetersburg](/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg \"Siege of Petersburg\"), where the two\narmies engaged in [trench warfare](/wiki/Trench_warfare \"Trench warfare\") for\nover nine months.[178]\n\nGrant finally found a commander, General [Philip\nSheridan](/wiki/Philip_Sheridan \"Philip Sheridan\"), aggressive enough to\nprevail in the [Valley Campaigns of 1864](/wiki/Valley_Campaigns_of_1864\n\"Valley Campaigns of 1864\"). Sheridan was initially repelled at the [Battle of\nNew Market](/wiki/Battle_of_New_Market \"Battle of New Market\") by former U.S.\nVice President and Confederate Gen. [John C.\nBreckinridge](/wiki/John_C._Breckinridge \"John C. Breckinridge\"). The Battle\nof New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war. After\nredoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [Jubal A.\nEarly](/wiki/Jubal_Early \"Jubal Early\") in a series of battles, including a\nfinal decisive defeat at the [Battle of Cedar\nCreek](/wiki/Battle_of_Cedar_Creek \"Battle of Cedar Creek\"). Sheridan then\nproceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [Shenandoah\nValley](/wiki/Shenandoah_Valley \"Shenandoah Valley\"), a strategy similar to\nthe tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.[179]\n\nMeanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating\nConfederate Generals [Joseph E. Johnston](/wiki/Joseph_E._Johnston \"Joseph E.\nJohnston\") and [John Bell Hood](/wiki/John_Bell_Hood \"John Bell Hood\") along\nthe way. The [fall of Atlanta](/wiki/Battle_of_Atlanta \"Battle of Atlanta\") on\nSeptember 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.[180]\nHood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines\nand invade Tennessee in the [Franklin-Nashville Campaign](/wiki/Franklin-\nNashville_Campaign \"Franklin-Nashville Campaign\"). Union Maj. Gen. [John\nSchofield](/wiki/John_Schofield \"John Schofield\") defeated Hood at the [Battle\nof Franklin](/wiki/Battle_of_Franklin_\\(1864\\) \"Battle of Franklin \\(1864\\)\"),\nand [George H. Thomas](/wiki/George_Henry_Thomas \"George Henry Thomas\") dealt\nHood a massive defeat at the [Battle of Nashville](/wiki/Battle_of_Nashville\n\"Battle of Nashville\"), effectively destroying Hood's army.[181]\n\nLeaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an\nunknown destination, laying waste to about 20 percent of the farms in Georgia\nin his \"[March to the Sea](/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea \"Sherman's March\nto the Sea\")\". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at\n[Savannah](/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia \"Savannah, Georgia\"), Georgia in December\n1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no\nmajor battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and\nNorth Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south,\nincreasing the pressure on Lee's army.[182]\n\nLee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than\nGrant's. One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg\nfailed at the decisive [Battle of Five Forks](/wiki/Battle_of_Five_Forks\n\"Battle of Five Forks\") (sometimes called \"the\n[Waterloo](/wiki/Waterloo_in_popular_culture#Other \"Waterloo in popular\nculture\") of the Confederacy\") on April 1. This meant that the Union now\ncontrolled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely\ncutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost,\nLee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the [Union\nXXV Corps](/wiki/XXV_Corps_\\(Union_Army\\) \"XXV Corps \\(Union Army\\)\"),\ncomposed of black troops.

In 1861, Southerners\nvoluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression\nin Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this\ndid not work.

It also helped to turn\nEuropean opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that \"King\nCorn was more powerful than King Cotton\", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of\nthe British import trade to almost half.[190] When Britain did face a cotton\nshortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt\nand India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers,\nand British ships to transport weapons.[191]\n\nLincoln's foreign policy was deficient in 1861 in terms of appealing to\nEuropean public opinion. Diplomats had to explain that United States was not\ncommitted to the ending of slavery, but instead they repeated legalistic\narguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate spokesman,\non the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead\nfocusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and\nthe essential role of cotton in the European economy. In addition, the\nEuropean aristocracy (the dominant factor in every major country) was\n\"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the\nentire experiment in popular government had failed.

In 1862, the British considered\nmediation between North and South– though even such an offer would have risked\nwar with the U.S. British Prime Minister [Lord\nPalmerston](/wiki/Henry_John_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston \"Henry John\nTemple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston\") reportedly read _[Uncle Tom's\nCabin](/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\")_ three times when\ndeciding on this.[194]\n\nThe Union victory in the [Battle of Antietam](/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam \"Battle\nof Antietam\") caused them to delay this decision. The [Emancipation\nProclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation Proclamation\")\nover time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the\nConfederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own [seizure of\nMexico](/wiki/French_intervention_in_Mexico \"French intervention in Mexico\")\nultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in\nthe war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously\nconsidered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [Polish revolt against\nRussia](/wiki/January_Uprising \"January Uprising\") further distracted the\nEuropean powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral.[195]\n\n## Union victory and aftermath\n\n### Results\n\nThe [causes of the war](/wiki/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Origins of\nthe American Civil War\"), the reasons for its outcome, and even [the name of\nthe war itself](/wiki/Naming_the_American_Civil_War \"Naming the American Civil\nWar\") are subjects of lingering contention today. The North and West grew rich\nwhile the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political\npower of the slaveowners and rich southerners ended. Historians are less sure\nabout the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the\nsecond class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.[196]\n\nHistorians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most\nscholars, such as [James McPherson](/wiki/James_M._McPherson \"James M.\nMcPherson\"), argue that Confederate victory was at least possible.[197]\nMcPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made\nNorthern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the\nConfederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more\neasily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.[198]\n\nComparison of Union and Confederacy, 1860–1864[199] | Year | Union | Confederacy  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Population** | 1860 | 22,100,000 (71%) | 9,100,000 (29%)  \n1864 | 28,800,000 (90%)[b] | 3,000,000 (10%)[200]  \n**Free** | 1860 | 21,700,000 (81%) | 5,600,000 (19%)  \n**Slave** | 1860 | 400,000 (11%) | 3,500,000 (89%)  \n1864 | _negligible_ | 1,900,000[c]  \n**Soldiers** | 1860–64 | 2,100,000 (67%) | 1,064,000 (33%)  \n**Railroad miles** | 1860 | 21,800 (71%) | 8,800 (29%)  \n1864 | 29,100 (98%)[201] | _negligible_  \n**Manufactures** | 1860 | 90% | 10%  \n1864 | 98% | _negligible_  \n**Arms production** | 1860 | 97% | 3%  \n1864 | 98% | _negligible_  \n**Cotton bales** | 1860 | _negligible_ | 4,500,000  \n1864 | 300,000 | _negligible_  \n**Exports** | 1860 | 30% | 70%  \n1864 | 98% | _negligible_  \n  \nConfederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only\nneeded to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning\nwas too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy\nterritory and defeat Confederate armies to win.[198] Lincoln was not a\nmilitary dictator, and could only continue to fight the war as long as the\nAmerican public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to\nwin independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and\nLincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political\nvictory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of\nthe Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the\nneutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he\nalso defeated the [Copperheads](/wiki/Copperheads_\\(politics\\) \"Copperheads\n\\(politics\\)\") and their peace platform.[202]\n\nMany scholars argue that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage\nover the Confederacy in industrial strength and population. Confederate\nactions, they argue, only delayed defeat.[203][204] Civil War historian\n[Shelby Foote](/wiki/Shelby_Foote \"Shelby Foote\") expressed this view\nsuccinctly: \"I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its\nback ... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North\nsimply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't\nthink the South ever had a chance to win that War.\"[205]\n\nA minority view among historians is that the Confederacy lost because, as [E.\nMerton Coulter](/wiki/E._Merton_Coulter \"E. Merton Coulter\") put it, \"people\ndid not will hard enough and long enough to win.\"[206][207] Marxist historian\nArmstead Robinson agrees, pointing to a class conflict in the Confederates\narmy between the slave owners and the larger number of non-owners. He argues\nthat the non-owner soldiers grew embittered about fighting to preserve\nslavery, and fought less enthusiastically. He attributes the major Confederate\ndefeats in 1863 at Vicksburg and Missionary Ridge to this class conflict.[208]\nHowever, most historians reject the argument.[209] [James M.\nMcPherson](/wiki/James_M._McPherson \"James M. McPherson\"), after reading\nthousands of letters written by Confederate soldiers, found strong patriotism\nthat continued to the end; they truly believed they were fighting for freedom\nand liberty. Even as the Confederacy was visibly collapsing in 1864–65, he\nsays most Confederate soldiers were fighting hard.[210] Historian Gary\nGallagher cites General Sherman who in early 1864 commented, \"The devils seem\nto have a determination that cannot but be admired.\" Despite their loss of\nslaves and wealth, with starvation looming, Sherman continued, \"yet I see no\nsign of let up—some few deserters—plenty tired of war, but the masses\ndetermined to fight it out.\"[211]\n\nAlso important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose\nand his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. The\nEmancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war\npowers.[212] The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe\ninvolved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern\nleaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union\nhad created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was\n95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports\nto the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and\nBritain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's\nAtlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance\nthat either Britain or France would enter the war.[213]\n\nHistorian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on\nthe course of world history.[214] The Union victory energized popular\ndemocratic forces. A Confederate victory, on the other hand, would have meant\na new birth of slavery, not freedom. Historian Fergus Bordewich, following\nDoyle, argues that:\n\n> The North's victory decisively proved the durability of democratic\n> government. Confederate independence, on the other hand, would have\n> established an American model for reactionary politics and race-based\n> repression that would likely have cast an international shadow into the\n> twentieth century and perhaps beyond.\"[215]\n\n### Costs\n\nThe war resulted in at least 1,030,000 casualties (3 percent of the\npopulation), including about 620,000 soldier deaths—two-thirds by disease, and\n50,000 civilians.[12] Binghamton University historian J. David Hacker believes\nthe number of soldier deaths was approximately 750,000, 20 percent higher than\ntraditionally estimated, and possibly as high as 850,000.[20][216] The war\naccounted for more American deaths than in all other U.S. wars combined.[217]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Alfred_A._Stratton.jpg/110px-\nAlfred_A._Stratton.jpg)](/wiki/File:Alfred_A._Stratton.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Cold_Harbor%2C_Va._African_Americans_collecting_bones.jpg/150px-\nCold_Harbor%2C_Va._African_Americans_collecting_bones.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cold_Harbor,_Va._African_Americans_collecting_bones.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Andersonville_National_Cemetery.jpg/185px-\nAndersonville_National_Cemetery.jpg)](/wiki/File:Andersonville_National_Cemetery.jpg)\n\nOne in thirteen veterans were amputees.\n\nRemains of both sides were reinterred.\n\nNational cemetery in [Andersonville,\nGA.](/wiki/Andersonville_National_Cemetery \"Andersonville National Cemetery\")\n\nBased on 1860 census figures, 8 percent of all white males aged 13 to 43 died\nin the war, including 6 percent in the North and 18 percent in the\nSouth.[218][219] About 56,000 soldiers [died in prison\ncamps](/wiki/American_Civil_War_prison_camps \"American Civil War prison\ncamps\") during the War.[220] An estimated 60,000 men lost limbs in the\nwar.[221]\n\nUnion army dead, amounting to 15 percent of the over two million who served,\nwas broken down as follows:[7]\n\n  * 110,070 killed in action (67,000) or died of wounds (43,000).\n  * 199,790 died of disease (75 percent was due to the war, the remainder would have occurred in civilian life anyway)\n  * 24,866 died in Confederate prison camps\n  * 9,058 killed by accidents or drowning\n  * 15,741 other/unknown deaths\n  * 359,528 total dead\n\nIn addition there were 4,523 deaths in the Navy (2,112 in battle) and 460 in\nthe Marines (148 in battle).[8]\n\nBlack troops made up 10 percent of the Union death toll, they amounted to 15\npercent of disease deaths but less than 3 percent of those killed in\nbattle.[7] Losses among [African Americans](/wiki/African_American \"African\nAmerican\") were high, in the last year and a half and from all reported\ncasualties, approximately 20 percent of all African Americans enrolled in the\nmilitary lost their lives during the Civil War.[222]:16 Notably, their\nmortality rate was significantly higher than white soldiers:\n\n> [We] find, according to the revised official data, that of the slightly over\n> two millions troops in the United States Volunteers, over 316,000 died (from\n> all causes), or 15.2 percent.

Fox list 74,524 killed\nand died of wounds and 59,292 died of disease. Including Confederate estimates\nof battle losses where no records exist would bring the Confederate death toll\nto 94,000 killed and died of wounds. Fox complained, however, that records\nwere incomplete, especially during the last year of the war, and that\nbattlefield reports likely under-counted deaths (many men counted as wounded\nin battlefield reports subsequently died of their wounds). Thomas L.\nLivermore, using Fox's data, put the number of Confederate non-combat deaths\nat 166,000, using the official estimate of Union deaths from disease and\naccidents and a comparison of Union and Confederate enlistment records, for a\ntotal of 260,000 deaths.[7] However, this excludes the 30,000 deaths of\nConfederate troops in prisons, which would raise the minimum number of deaths\nto 290,000.\n\nThe United States National Park Service uses the following figures in its\nofficial tally of war losses:[3]\n\n**Union: 853,838**\n\n  * 110,100 killed in action\n  * 224,580 disease deaths\n  * 275,154 wounded in action\n  * 211,411 captured (including 30,192 who died as POWs)\n\n**Confederate: 914,660**\n\n  * 94,000 killed in action\n  * 164,000 disease deaths\n  * 194,026 wounded in action\n  * 462,634 captured (including 31,000 who died as POWs)\n\nWhile the figures of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the\nConfederacy remained commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many\nConfederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows\nnot reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only\ncounted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands\nwho died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened\nonly a few days or weeks later. [Francis Amasa\nWalker](/wiki/Francis_Amasa_Walker \"Francis Amasa Walker\"), Superintendent of\nthe 1870 Census, used census and Surgeon General data to estimate a minimum of\n500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a\ntotal death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally\ndismissed because of the 1870 Census's undercounting, it was later found that\nthe census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be\nroughly accurate.[216]\n\nAnalyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation\nof the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least\n627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the\nwar.[21] This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and\n411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate\nbattle losses.\n\nDeaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack\nof reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be\nconsiderable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in\nan area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food\nfor them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to\nhundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation,\nexposure, or execution at the hands of the Confederates, and that if these\ndeaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1\nmillion.[223]\n\nLosses were far higher than during the recent [defeat of\nMexico](/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War \"Mexican–American War\"), which saw\nroughly thirteen thousand American deaths, including fewer than two thousand\nkilled in battle, between 1846 and 1848. One reason for the high number of\nbattle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those\nof the [Napoleonic Wars](/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars \"Napoleonic Wars\") at the turn\nof the century, such as [charging](/wiki/Charge_\\(warfare\\) \"Charge\n\\(warfare\\)\"). With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [Minié\nballs](/wiki/Mini%C3%A9_ball \"Minié ball\") and (near the end of the war for\nthe [Union army](/wiki/Union_army \"Union army\")) repeating firearms such as\nthe [Spencer Repeating Rifle](/wiki/Spencer_repeating_rifle \"Spencer repeating\nrifle\") and the [Henry Repeating Rifle](/wiki/Henry_rifle \"Henry rifle\"),\nsoldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the\nadoption of [trench warfare](/wiki/Trench_warfare \"Trench warfare\"), a style\nof fighting that defined much of World War I.[224]\n\nThe wealth amassed in slaves and slavery for the Confederacy's 3.5 million\nblacks effectively ended when Union armies arrived; they were nearly all freed\nby the Emancipation Proclamation. Slaves in the border states and those\nlocated in some former Confederate territory occupied before the Emancipation\nProclamation were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the\n[Thirteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\").[225]\n\nThe war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the South. All\naccumulated investment Confederate bonds was forfeit; most banks and railroads\nwere bankrupt. Income per person in the South dropped to less than 40 percent\nof that of the North, a condition that lasted until well into the 20th\ncentury. Southern influence in the U.S. federal government, previously\nconsiderable, was greatly diminished until the latter half of the 20th\ncentury.[226] The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly\ncontentious postwar era known as\n[Reconstruction](/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States \"Reconstruction\nEra of the United States\").\n\n### Emancipation\n\n#### Slavery as a war issue\n\nWhile not all Southerners saw themselves as fighting to preserve slavery, most\nof the officers and over a third of the rank and file in\n[Lee](/wiki/Robert_E._Lee \"Robert E. Lee\")'s army had close family ties to\nslavery. To Northerners, in contrast, the motivation was primarily to preserve\nthe [Union](/wiki/Union_\\(American_Civil_War\\) \"Union \\(American Civil\nWar\\)\"), not to abolish slavery.[227] Abraham Lincoln consistently made\npreserving the Union the central goal of the war, though he increasingly saw\nslavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal.[228]\nLincoln's decision to issue the [Emancipation\nProclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation Proclamation\")\nangered both [Peace Democrats](/wiki/Peace_Democrats \"Peace Democrats\")\n(\"Copperheads\") and [War Democrats](/wiki/War_Democrats \"War Democrats\"), but\nenergized most Republicans.[229] By warning that free blacks would flood the\nNorth, Democrats made gains in the [1862\nelections](/wiki/1862_congressional_elections \"1862 congressional elections\"),\nbut they did not gain control of Congress. The Republicans' counterargument\nthat slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support, with the\nDemocrats losing decisively in the 1863 elections in the northern state of\nOhio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment.[230]\n\n#### Emancipation Proclamation\n\nMain article: [Emancipation Proclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation\n\"Emancipation Proclamation\")\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and\nescaped slaves, to join the Union Army.[d] About 190,000 volunteered, further\nenhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the\nConfederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear\nof fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.[e]\n\nDuring the Civil War, sentiment concerning slaves, enslavement and\nemancipation in the United States was divided. In 1861, Lincoln worried that\npremature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states,\nand that \"to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.\"[236]\n[Copperheads](/wiki/Copperheads_\\(politics\\) \"Copperheads \\(politics\\)\") and\nsome [War Democrats](/wiki/War_Democrats \"War Democrats\") opposed\nemancipation, although the latter eventually accepted it as part of [total\nwar](/wiki/Total_war \"Total war\") needed to save the Union.[237]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Contrabands_at_Headquarters_of_General_Lafayette_by_Mathew_Brady.jpg/300px-\nContrabands_at_Headquarters_of_General_Lafayette_by_Mathew_Brady.jpg)](/wiki/File:Contrabands_at_Headquarters_of_General_Lafayette_by_Mathew_Brady.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Soldiers_White_Black_1861.jpg/140px-\nSoldiers_White_Black_1861.jpg)](/wiki/File:Soldiers_White_Black_1861.jpg)\n\nLeft: [Contrabands](/wiki/Contraband_\\(American_Civil_War\\) \"Contraband\n\\(American Civil War\\)\")—fugitive slaves—cooks, laundresses, laborers,\nteamsters, railroad repair crews—fled to the Union Army, but were not\nofficially freed until 1863.

Frémont\") (in Missouri) and\n[David Hunter](/wiki/David_Hunter \"David Hunter\") (in South Carolina, Georgia\nand Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.\nLincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation\nwould happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and\nvoluntary colonization was rejected.[238] But only the District of Columbia\naccepted Lincoln's gradual plan, which was enacted by Congress. When Lincoln\ntold his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation, Seward advised\nLincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it, as to do otherwise would seem\nlike \"our last shriek on the retreat\".[239] Lincoln laid the groundwork for\npublic support in an open letter published in abolitionist Horace Greeley's\nnewspaper.[240]\n\nIn September 1862, the [Battle of Antietam](/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam \"Battle\nof Antietam\") provided this opportunity, and the subsequent [War Governors'\nConference](/wiki/War_Governors%27_Conference \"War Governors' Conference\")\nadded support for the proclamation.[241] Lincoln issued his preliminary\n[Emancipation Proclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation\nProclamation\") on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation\non January 1, 1863. In his letter to [Albert G.\nHodges](/w/index.php?title=Albert_G._Hodges&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Albert G.\nHodges \\(page does not exist\\)\"), Lincoln explained his belief that \"If\nslavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood\nthat the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially\nupon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but\nconfess plainly that events have controlled me.\"[242]\n\nLincoln's moderate approach succeeded in inducing border states, War Democrats\nand emancipated slaves to fight for the Union. The Union-controlled border\nstates (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) and Union-\ncontrolled regions around New Orleans, Norfolk and elsewhere, were not covered\nby the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except\nKentucky and Delaware.[243]\n\nSince the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers,\nit only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the\nProclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add\nemancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.[244] The Emancipation\nProclamation greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from\nBritain or France.[245] By late 1864, Lincoln was playing a leading role in\ngetting Congress to vote for the [Thirteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), which made\nemancipation universal and permanent.[246]\n\n### Texas v.

[Radical\nRepublicans](/wiki/Radical_Republicans \"Radical Republicans\") demanded proof\nthat Confederate nationalism was dead and that the slaves were truly free.\nThey came to the fore after the 1866 elections and undid much of Johnson's\nwork.

The [Compromise\nof 1877](/wiki/Compromise_of_1877 \"Compromise of 1877\") closed with a national\nconsensus that the Civil War had finally ended.[250] With the withdrawal of\nfederal troops, however, whites retook control of every Southern legislature;\nthe [Jim Crow](/wiki/Jim_Crow \"Jim Crow\") period of disenfranchisement and\nlegal segregation was about to begin.\n\n## Memory and historiography\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_by_Swatjester.jpg/200px-\nGrand_Army_of_the_Republic_by_Swatjester.jpg)](/wiki/File:Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_by_Swatjester.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Cherokee_Confederates_Reunion.gif/226px-\nCherokee_Confederates_Reunion.gif)](/wiki/File:Cherokee_Confederates_Reunion.gif)\n\nLeft: Monument to the [Grand Army of the\nRepublic](/wiki/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic \"Grand Army of the Republic\"), a\nUnion veteran organization\n\nRight: [Cherokee Confederates](/wiki/Cherokee_in_the_American_Civil_War\n\"Cherokee in the American Civil War\") reunion in New Orleans, 1903\n\nThe Civil War is one of the central events in American collective memory.\nThere are innumerable statues, commemorations, books and archival collections.\nThe memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of\nsoldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war\nin literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations\nof the moral and political lessons of the war.[251] The last theme includes\nmoral evaluations of [racism](/wiki/Racism \"Racism\") and slavery, heroism in\ncombat and heroism behind the lines, and the issues of democracy and minority\nrights, as well as the notion of an \"[Empire of\nLiberty](/wiki/Empire_of_Liberty \"Empire of Liberty\")\" influencing the\nworld.[252]\n\nProfessional historians have paid much more attention to the causes of the\nwar, than to the war itself. Military history has largely developed outside\nacademe, leading to a proliferation of solid studies by non-scholars who are\nthoroughly familiar with the primary sources, pay close attention to battles\nand campaigns, and write for the large public readership, rather than the\nsmall scholarly community. [Bruce Catton](/wiki/Bruce_Catton \"Bruce Catton\")\nand [Shelby Foote](/wiki/Shelby_Foote \"Shelby Foote\") are among the best-known\nwriters.[253][254] Practically every major figure in the war, both North and\nSouth, has had a serious biographical study.[255] Deeply religious Southerners\nsaw the hand of God in history, which demonstrated His wrath at their\nsinfulness, or His rewards for their suffering. Historian Wilson Fallin has\nexamined the sermons of white and black [Baptist](/wiki/Baptists \"Baptists\")\npreachers after the War. Southern white preachers said:\n\n> God had chastised them and given them a special mission—to maintain\n> orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations.\n> Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a\n> historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's\n> favor.[256]\n\nIn sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:\n\n> God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their\n> independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and\n> dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.\n> Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and\n> conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and\n> provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a\n> result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help\n> him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.[257]\n\n### Lost Cause\n\nMain article: [Lost Cause of the\nConfederacy](/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy \"Lost Cause of the\nConfederacy\")\n\nMemory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [\"Lost\nCause\"](/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy \"Lost Cause of the Confederacy\"),\nshaping regional identity and race relations for generations.[258] Alan T.\nNolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly \"a rationalization, a cover-up\nto vindicate the name and fame\" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve\naround the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural\ndifferences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate\nactors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.[259] Nolan\nargues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the\nreunification of the North and the South while excusing the \"virulent racism\"\nof the 19th century, sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's\nreunification. He also deems the Lost Cause \"a caricature of the truth. This\ncaricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter\" in every\ninstance.[260]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Civil_War_centennial_issues.jpg/300px-\nCivil_War_centennial_issues.jpg)](/wiki/File:Civil_War_centennial_issues.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Civil_War_centennial_issues.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBeginning in 1961 the U.S. Post Office released [Commemorative\nstamps](/wiki/Commemorative_stamp \"Commemorative stamp\") for five famous\nbattles, each issued on the 100th anniversary of the respective battle.\n\n### Beardian historiography\n\nThe interpretation of the Civil War presented by [Charles A.\nBeard](/wiki/Charles_A._Beard \"Charles A. Beard\") and Mary R. Beard in _The\nRise of American Civilization_ (1927) was highly influential among historians\nand the general public until the [Civil Rights\nMovement](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement \"Civil Rights Movement\") of the 1950s\nand 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of\nmorality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even\nignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the\nwar. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an\nephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The\nBeards announced that the Civil War was really:\n\n> [A] social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the\n> North and West drove from power in the national government the planting\n> aristocracy of the South.[261]\n\nThe Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it\nbecame defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an\nemphasis on slavery. However, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause\nwriters.[262]\n\n### Civil War commemoration\n\nMain article: [Commemoration of the American Civil\nWar](/wiki/Commemoration_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Commemoration of the\nAmerican Civil War\")\n\nSee also: [Commemoration of the American Civil War on postage\nstamps](/wiki/Commemoration_of_the_American_Civil_War_on_postage_stamps\n\"Commemoration of the American Civil War on postage stamps\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_issue_1948_3c.JPG/220px-\nGrand_Army_of_the_Republic_issue_1948_3c.JPG)](/wiki/File:Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_issue_1948_3c.JPG)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/United_Confederate_Veterans_1951_3c.JPG/220px-\nUnited_Confederate_Veterans_1951_3c.JPG)](/wiki/File:United_Confederate_Veterans_1951_3c.JPG)\n\nLeft: Grand Army of the Republic (Union)\n\nRight: United Confederate Veterans\n\nThe American Civil War has been commemorated in many capacities ranging from\nthe reenactment of battles, to statues and memorial halls erected, to films\nbeing produced, to stamps and coins with Civil War themes being issued, all of\nwhich helped to shape public memory. This varied advent occurred in greater\nproportions on the 100th and 150th anniversary. [263]\n[Hollywood](/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States \"Cinema of the United States\")'s\ntake on the war has been especially influential in shaping public memory, as\nseen in such film classics as _[Birth of a Nation](/wiki/Birth_of_a_Nation\n\"Birth of a Nation\")_ (1915), _[Gone with the\nWind](/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_\\(film\\) \"Gone with the Wind \\(film\\)\")_\n(1939), and more recently _[Lincoln](/wiki/Lincoln_\\(2012_film\\) \"Lincoln\n\\(2012 film\\)\")_ (2012). [Ken Burns](/wiki/Ken_Burns \"Ken Burns\") produced a\nnotable PBS series on television titled _[The Civil\nWar](/wiki/The_Civil_War_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Civil War \\(TV series\\)\")_ (1990).\nIt was digitally remastered and re-released in 2015.\n\n### Technological significance\n\nThere were numerous technological innovations during the Civil War that had a\ngreat impact on 19th century science. The Civil War was one of the earliest\nexamples of an \"[industrial war](/wiki/Industrial_warfare \"Industrial\nwarfare\")\", in which technological might is used to achieve military supremacy\nin a war.[264] New inventions, such as the [train](/wiki/Military_railways\n\"Military railways\") and [telegraph](/wiki/Telegraphy \"Telegraphy\"), delivered\nsoldiers, supplies and messages at a time when horses were considered to be\nthe fastest way to travel.[265][266] It was also in this war when countries\nfirst used aerial warfare, in the form of reconnaissance\n[balloons](/wiki/History_of_aerial_warfare#American_Civil_War \"History of\naerial warfare\"), to a significant effect.[267] It saw the first action\ninvolving steam-powered [ironclad

and\nsingle-shot firearms in warfare, as well as the first appearances of rapid-\nfiring weapons and [machine guns](/wiki/Machine_gun \"Machine gun\") such as the\n[Agar gun](/wiki/Agar_gun \"Agar

casualties by looking at the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm through analysis of census data found that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000 people, but most likely 761,000 people, died through the war.[21]\n  2. **Jump up ^** \"Union population 1864\" aggregates 1860 population, average annual immigration 1855–1864, and population governed formerly by CSA per Kenneth Martis source. Contrabands and after the Emancipation Proclamation freedmen, migrating into Union control on the coasts and to the advancing armies, and natural increase are excluded.\n  3. **Jump up ^** \"Slave 1864, CSA\" aggregates 1860 slave census of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Texas. It omits losses from contraband and after the Emancipation Proclamation, freedmen migrating to the Union controlled coastal ports and those joining advancing Union armies, especially in the Mississippi Valley.\n  4. **Jump up ^** At the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves \"... cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.\"[231] The same Congressman—and his fellow Radical Republicans—put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization.[232] Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. See Catton, Bruce. _Never Call Retreat_ , p. 335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry](/wiki/54th_Massachusetts_Volunteer_Infantry \"54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry\").\n  5. **Jump up ^** In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders—until 1865—opposed enlisting slaves. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As [Howell Cobb](/wiki/Howell_Cobb \"Howell Cobb\") said, \"If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\" Confederate generals [Patrick Cleburne](/wiki/Patrick_Cleburne \"Patrick Cleburne\") and [Robert E. Lee](/wiki/Robert_E._Lee \"Robert E. Lee\") argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and [Jefferson Davis](/wiki/Jefferson_Davis \"Jefferson Davis\") was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at [Appomattox](/wiki/Appomattox,_Virginia \"Appomattox, Virginia\") before this plan could be implemented.[233] The great majority of the 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved south. Historian [John D. Winters](/wiki/John_D._Winters \"John D. Winters\") referred to the exhilaration of the slaves when the Union Army came through [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana \"Louisiana\"): \"As the troops moved up to [Alexandria](/wiki/Alexandria,_Louisiana \"Alexandria, Louisiana\"), the Negroes crowded the roadsides to watch the passing army.
