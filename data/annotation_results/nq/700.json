Delivered to over\n250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the [Lincoln\nMemorial](/wiki/Lincoln_Memorial \"Lincoln Memorial\") in [Washington,\nD.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\"), the speech was a defining\nmoment of the [Civil Rights Movement](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement \"Civil\nRights Movement\").[2]\n\nBeginning with a reference to the [Emancipation\nProclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation Proclamation\"),\nwhich freed millions of slaves in 1863,[3] King observes that: \"one hundred\nyears later, the Negro still is not free\".[4] Toward the end of the speech,\nKing departed from his prepared text for a partly improvised\n[peroration](/wiki/Peroration \"Peroration\") on the theme \"I have a dream\",\nprompted by [Mahalia Jackson](/wiki/Mahalia_Jackson \"Mahalia Jackson\")'s cry:\n\"Tell them about the dream, Martin!\"[5] In this part of the speech, which most\nexcited the listeners and has now become its most famous, King described his\ndreams of freedom and equality arising from a land of slavery and hatred.[6]\n[Jon Meacham](/wiki/Jon_Meacham \"Jon Meacham\") writes that, \"With a single\nphrase, Martin Luther King Jr. joined [Jefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson\n\"Thomas Jefferson\") and [Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\") in\nthe ranks of men who've shaped modern America\".[7] The speech was ranked the\ntop American speech of the 20th century in a 1999 poll of scholars of public\naddress.[8]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n    * 1.1 Speech title and the writing process\n  * 2 Speech\n    * 2.1 Similarities and allusions\n  * 3 Rhetoric\n  * 4 Responses\n  * 5 Legacy\n  * 6 Copyright dispute\n  * 7 Original copy of the speech\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Background\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/IhaveadreamMarines.jpg/220px-\nIhaveadreamMarines.jpg)](/wiki/File:IhaveadreamMarines.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:IhaveadreamMarines.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nView from the [Lincoln Memorial](/wiki/Lincoln_Memorial \"Lincoln Memorial\")\ntoward the [Washington Monument](/wiki/Washington_Monument \"Washington\nMonument\") on August 28, 1963\n\nThe [March on Washington for Jobs and\nFreedom](/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom \"March on Washington\nfor Jobs and Freedom\") was partly intended to demonstrate mass support for the\n[civil rights legislation](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964 \"Civil Rights Act of\n1964\") proposed by [President Kennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F.\nKennedy\") in June. Martin Luther King and other leaders therefore agreed to\nkeep their speeches calm, also, to avoid provoking the [civil\ndisobedience](/wiki/Civil_disobedience \"Civil disobedience\") which had become\nthe hallmark of the Civil Rights Movement. King originally designed his speech\nas a homage to [Abraham Lincoln's](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\")\n[Gettysburg Address](/wiki/Gettysburg_Address \"Gettysburg Address\"), timed to\ncorrespond with the 100-year centennial of the [Emancipation\nProclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation Proclamation\").[6]\n\n### Speech title and the writing process\n\nKing had been preaching about dreams since 1960, when he gave a speech to the\n[National Association for the Advancement of Colored\nPeople](/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People\n\"National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\") (NAACP) called\n\"The Negro and the American Dream\". This speech discusses the gap between the\nAmerican dream and reality, saying that overt [white\nsupremacists](/wiki/White_supremacy \"White supremacy\") have violated the\ndream, and that \"our federal government has also scarred the dream through its\napathy and hypocrisy, its betrayal of the cause of justice\". King suggests\nthat \"It may well be that the Negro is God's instrument to save the soul of\nAmerica.\"[9][10] In 1961, he spoke of the Civil Rights Movement and student\nactivists' \"dream\" of equality—\"the American Dream ... a dream as yet\nunfulfilled\"—in several national speeches and statements, and took \"the dream\"\nas the centerpiece for these speeches.[11]\n\nOn November 27, 1962, King gave a speech at Booker T. Washington High School\nin [Rocky Mount, North Carolina](/wiki/Rocky_Mount,_North_Carolina \"Rocky\nMount, North Carolina\"). That speech was longer than the version which he\nwould eventually deliver from the Lincoln Memorial. And while parts of the\ntext had been moved around, large portions were identical, including the \"I\nhave a dream\" refrain.[12][13] After being rediscovered,[14] the restored and\ndigitized recording of the 1962 speech was presented to the public by the\nEnglish department of [North Carolina State\nUniversity](/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University \"North Carolina State\nUniversity\").[12]\n\nMartin Luther King had also delivered a \"dream\" speech in\n[Detroit](/wiki/Detroit \"Detroit\"), in June 1963, when he marched on [Woodward\nAvenue](/wiki/M-1_\\(Michigan_highway\\) \"M-1 \\(Michigan highway\\)\") with\n[Walter Reuther](/wiki/Walter_Reuther \"Walter Reuther\") and the Reverend [C.\nL. Franklin](/wiki/C._L._Franklin \"C. L. Franklin\"), and had rehearsed other\nparts.[15]\n\nThe March on Washington Speech, known as \"I Have a Dream Speech\", has been\nshown to have had several versions, written at several different times.[16] It\nhas no single version draft, but is an amalgamation of several drafts, and was\noriginally called \"Normalcy, Never Again\". Little of this, and another\n\"Normalcy Speech\", ended up in the final draft. A draft of \"Normalcy, Never\nAgain\" is housed in the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. Collection of\nthe [Robert W. Woodruff Library, Atlanta University\nCenter](/wiki/Robert_W._Woodruff_Library,_Atlanta_University_Center \"Robert W.\nWoodruff Library, Atlanta University Center\") and Morehouse College.[17] The\nfocus on \"I have a dream\" comes through the speech's delivery. Toward the end\nof its delivery, noted African American [gospel](/wiki/Gospel_music \"Gospel\nmusic\") singer [Mahalia Jackson](/wiki/Mahalia_Jackson \"Mahalia Jackson\")\nshouted to King from the crowd, \"Tell them about the dream, Martin.\"[18] King\ndeparted from his prepared remarks and started \"preaching\" improvisationally,\npunctuating his points with \"I have a dream.\"\n\nThe speech was drafted with the assistance of [Stanley\nLevison](/wiki/Stanley_Levison \"Stanley Levison\") and [Clarence Benjamin\nJones](/wiki/Clarence_Benjamin_Jones \"Clarence Benjamin Jones\")[19] in\n[Riverdale](/wiki/Riverdale,_Bronx \"Riverdale, Bronx\"), New York City. Jones\nhas said that \"the logistical preparations for the march were so burdensome\nthat the speech was not a priority for us\" and that, \"on the evening of\nTuesday, Aug. 27, [12 hours before the march] Martin still didn't know what he\nwas going to say\".[20]\n\nLeading up to the speech's rendition at the Great March on Washington, King\nhad delivered its \"I have a dream\" refrains in his speech before 25,000 people\nin Detroit's [Cobo Hall](/wiki/Cobo_Hall \"Cobo Hall\") immediately after the\n125,000-strong [Great Walk to Freedom in\nDetroit](/wiki/Great_Walk_to_Freedom_in_Detroit \"Great Walk to Freedom in\nDetroit\"), June 23, 1963.[21][22] After the Washington, D.C. March, a\nrecording of King's Cobo Hall speech was released by Detroit's Gordy Records\nas an LP entitled \"The Great March To Freedom\".[23]\n\n## Speech\n\nWidely hailed as a masterpiece of [rhetoric](/wiki/Rhetoric \"Rhetoric\"),\nKing's speech invokes pivotal documents in American history, including the\n[Declaration of Independence](/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence\n\"United States Declaration of Independence\"), the [Emancipation\nProclamation](/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation \"Emancipation Proclamation\"),\nand the [United States Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United\nStates Constitution\"). Early in his speech, King [alludes](/wiki/Allusion\n\"Allusion\") to [Abraham Lincoln's](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\")\n[Gettysburg Address](/wiki/Gettysburg_Address \"Gettysburg Address\") by saying\n\"Five score years ago...\" In reference to the [abolition of\nslavery](/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States \"Abolitionism in the United\nStates\") articulated in the Emancipation Proclamation, King says: \"It came as\na joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\"\n[Anaphora](/wiki/Anaphora_\\(rhetoric\\) \"Anaphora \\(rhetoric\\)\") (i.e., the\nrepetition of a phrase at the beginning of sentences) is employed throughout\nthe speech. Early in his speech, King urges his audience to seize the moment;\n\"Now is the time\" is repeated three times in the sixth paragraph. The most\nwidely cited example of anaphora is found in the often quoted phrase \"I have a\ndream\", which is repeated eight times as King paints a picture of an\nintegrated and unified America for his audience. Other occasions include \"One\nhundred years later\", \"We can never be satisfied\", \"With this faith\", \"Let\nfreedom ring\", and \"free at last\". King was the sixteenth out of eighteen\npeople to speak that day, according to the official program.[24]\n\nI still have a dream, a dream deeply rooted in the American dream – one day\nthis nation will rise up and live up to its creed, \"We hold these truths to be\nself evident: that all men are created equal.\" I have a dream...\n\n“\n\n”\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. (1963)[25]\n\nAmong the most quoted lines of the speech include \"I have a dream that my four\nlittle children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by\nthe color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream\ntoday!\"[26]\n\nAccording to [U.S.\nRepresentative](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\") [John\nLewis](/wiki/John_Lewis_\\(Georgia_politician\\) \"John Lewis \\(Georgia\npolitician\\)\"), who also spoke that day as the president of the [Student\nNonviolent Coordinating\nCommittee](/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee \"Student Nonviolent\nCoordinating Committee\"), \"Dr. King had the power, the ability, and the\ncapacity to transform those steps on the Lincoln Memorial into a monumental\narea that will forever be recognized. By speaking the way he did, he educated,\nhe inspired, he informed not just the people there, but people throughout\nAmerica and unborn generations.\"[27]\n\nThe ideas in the speech reflect King's social experiences of ethnocentric\nabuse, the mistreatment and exploitation of blacks.[28] The speech draws upon\nappeals to America's myths as a nation founded to provide freedom and justice\nto all people, and then reinforces and transcends those secular mythologies by\nplacing them within a spiritual context by arguing that racial justice is also\nin accord with God's will. Thus, the rhetoric of the speech provides\nredemption to America for its racial sins.[29] King describes the promises\nmade by America as a \"[promissory note](/wiki/Promissory_note \"Promissory\nnote\")\" on which America has defaulted. He says that \"America has given the\nNegro people a bad check\", but that \"we've come to cash this check\" by\nmarching in Washington, D.C.\n\n### Similarities and allusions\n\nFurther information: [Martin Luther King Jr. authorship\nissues](/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._authorship_issues \"Martin Luther King Jr.\nauthorship issues\")\n\nKing's speech used words and ideas from his own speeches and other texts. For\nyears, he had spoken about dreams, quoted from [Samuel Francis\nSmith's](/wiki/Samuel_Francis_Smith \"Samuel Francis Smith\") popular patriotic\nhymn \"[America](/wiki/My_Country,_%27Tis_of_Thee \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\")\"\n(\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\"), and of course referred extensively to the Bible.\nThe idea of [constitutional rights](/wiki/Constitutional_rights\n\"Constitutional rights\") as an \"unfulfilled promise\" was suggested by\n[Clarence Jones](/wiki/Clarence_Benjamin_Jones \"Clarence Benjamin Jones\").[9]\n\nThe final passage from King's speech closely resembles [Archibald Carey\nJr.'s](/wiki/Archibald_Carey_Jr. \"Archibald Carey Jr.\") address to the [1952\nRepublican National Convention](/wiki/1952_Republican_National_Convention\n\"1952 Republican National Convention\"): both speeches end with a recitation of\nthe first verse of \"America\", and the speeches share the name of one of\nseveral mountains from which both exhort \"let freedom ring\".[9][30]\n\nKing also is said to have used portions of [Prathia Hall's](/wiki/Prathia_Hall\n\"Prathia Hall\") speech at the site of a burned-down African American church in\n[Terrell County, Georgia](/wiki/Terrell_County,_Georgia \"Terrell County,\nGeorgia\"), in September 1962, in which she used the repeated phrase \"I have a\ndream\".[31] The church burned down after it was used for voter registration\nmeetings.[32]\n\nThe speech also alludes to [Psalm\n30:5](http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Psalms+30:5–30:5&version=nrsv)[33] in\nthe second stanza of the speech. Additionally, King quotes from [Isaiah\n40:4–5](http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Isaiah+40:4–5:4&version=nrsv) (\"I\nhave a dream that every valley shall be exalted...\"[34]) and [Amos\n5:24](/wiki/Amos_5:24 \"Amos 5:24\") (\"But let justice roll down like\nwater...\"[35]). He also alludes to the opening lines of\n[Shakespeare](/wiki/Shakespeare \"Shakespeare\")'s _[Richard\nIII](/wiki/Richard_III_\\(play\\) \"Richard III \\(play\\)\")_ (\"Now is the winter\nof our discontent / Made glorious summer...\") when he remarks that \"this\nsweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until\nthere is an invigorating autumn...\"\n\n## Rhetoric\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Civil_Rights_March_on_Washington%2C_D.C._%28Dr._Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._and_Mathew_Ahmann_in_a_crowd.%29_-_NARA_-_542015_-_Restoration.jpg/220px-\nCivil_Rights_March_on_Washington%2C_D.C._%28Dr._Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._and_Mathew_Ahmann_in_a_crowd.%29_-_NARA_-_542015_-_Restoration.jpg)](/wiki/File:Civil_Rights_March_on_Washington,_D.C._\\(Dr._Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._and_Mathew_Ahmann_in_a_crowd.\\)_-_NARA_-_542015_-_Restoration.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Civil_Rights_March_on_Washington,_D.C._\\(Dr._Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._and_Mathew_Ahmann_in_a_crowd.\\)_-_NARA_-_542015_-_Restoration.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nKing at the Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C\n\nThe \"I Have a Dream\" speech can be dissected by using three\n[rhetorical](/wiki/Rhetoric \"Rhetoric\") lenses: voice merging, prophetic\nvoice, and dynamic spectacle.[36] Voice merging is the combining of one's own\nvoice with religious predecessors. Prophetic voice is using rhetoric to speak\nfor a population. A dynamic spectacle has origins from the\n[Aristotelian](/wiki/Aristotelianism \"Aristotelianism\") definition as \"a weak\nhybrid form of drama, a theatrical concoction that relied upon external\nfactors (shock, sensation, and passionate release) such as televised rituals\nof conflict and social control.\"[37]\n\nVoice merging is a common technique used amongst African American preachers.\nIt combines the voices of previous preachers and excerpts from scriptures\nalong with their own unique thoughts to create a unique voice. King uses voice\nmerging in his [peroration](/wiki/Peroration \"Peroration\") when he references\nthe secular hymn \"America\".\n\nThe rhetoric of King's speech can be compared to the rhetoric of [Old\nTestament](/wiki/Old_Testament \"Old Testament\") prophets. During King's\nspeech, he speaks with urgency and crisis giving him a prophetic voice. The\nprophetic voice must \"restore a sense of duty and virtue amidst the decay of\nvenality.\"[38] An evident example is when King declares that, \"now is the time\nto make justice a reality for all of God's children.\"\n\nWhy King's speech was powerful is debated, but essentially, it came at a point\nof many factors combining at a key cultural turning point. Executive\nspeechwriter Anthony Trendl writes, \"The right man delivered the right words\nto the right people in the right place at the right time.\"[39]\n\n\"Given the context of drama and tension in which it was situated\", King's\nspeech can be classified as a dynamic spectacle.[40] A dynamic spectacle is\ndependent on the situation in which it is used. It can be considered a dynamic\nspectacle because it happened at the correct time and place: during the Civil\nRights Movement and the March on Washington.\n\n## Responses\n\nThe speech was lauded in the days after the event, and was widely considered\nthe high point of the March by contemporary observers.[41] [James\nReston](/wiki/James_Reston \"James Reston\"), writing for _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ , said that \"Dr. King\ntouched all the themes of the day, only better than anybody else. He was full\nof the symbolism of Lincoln and Gandhi, and the cadences of the Bible. He was\nboth militant and sad, and he sent the crowd away feeling that the long\njourney had been worthwhile.\"[9] Reston also noted that the event \"was better\ncovered by television and the press than any event here since President\nKennedy's inauguration\", and opined that \"it will be a long time before\n[Washington] forgets the melodious and melancholy voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin\nLuther King Jr. crying out his dreams to the multitude.\"[42] An article in\n_[The Boston Globe](/wiki/The_Boston_Globe \"The Boston Globe\")_ by [Mary\nMcGrory](/wiki/Mary_McGrory \"Mary McGrory\") reported that King's speech\n\"caught the mood\" and \"moved the crowd\" of the day \"as no other\" speaker in\nthe event.[43] [Marquis Childs](/wiki/Marquis_Childs \"Marquis Childs\") of\n_[The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_ wrote\nthat King's speech \"rose above mere oratory\".[44] An article in the _[Los\nAngeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles Times\")_ commented that\nthe \"matchless eloquence\" displayed by King—\"a supreme orator\" of \"a type so\nrare as almost to be forgotten in our age\"—put to shame the advocates of\n[segregation](/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States \"Racial\nsegregation in the United States\") by inspiring the \"conscience of America\"\nwith the justice of the civil-rights cause.[45]\n\nThe [Federal Bureau of Investigation](/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation\n\"Federal Bureau of Investigation\") (FBI), which viewed King and his allies for\nracial justice as subversive, also noticed the speech. This provoked the\norganization to expand their [COINTELPRO](/wiki/COINTELPRO \"COINTELPRO\")\noperation against the [Southern Christian Leadership\nConference](/wiki/Southern_Christian_Leadership_Conference \"Southern Christian\nLeadership Conference\") (SCLC), and to target King specifically as a major\nenemy of the United States.[46] Two days after King delivered \"I Have a\nDream\", Agent [William C. Sullivan](/wiki/William_C._Sullivan \"William C.\nSullivan\"), the head of COINTELPRO, wrote a memo about King's growing\ninfluence:\n\n> In the light of King's powerful demagogic speech yesterday he stands head\n> and shoulders above all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to\n> influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not\n> done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation\n> from the standpoint of communism, the Negro and national security.[47]\n\nThe speech was a success for the [Kennedy\nadministration](/wiki/Presidency_of_John_F._Kennedy \"Presidency of John F.\nKennedy\") and for the liberal civil rights coalition that had planned it. It\nwas considered a \"triumph of managed protest\", and not one arrest relating to\nthe demonstration occurred. Kennedy had watched King's speech on television\nand been very impressed. Afterwards, March leaders accepted an invitation to\nthe White House to meet with President Kennedy. Kennedy felt the March\nbolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.[48]\n\nMeanwhile, some of the more radical Black leaders who were present condemned\nthe speech (along with the rest of the march)[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] as too\ncompromising. [Malcolm X](/wiki/Malcolm_X \"Malcolm X\") later wrote in [his\nautobiography](/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X \"The Autobiography of\nMalcolm X\"): \"Who ever heard of angry revolutionaries swinging their bare feet\ntogether with their oppressor in lily pad pools, with gospels and guitars and\n'I have a dream' speeches?\"[6]\n\n## Legacy\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/I-have-a-dream-\nsite.jpg/300px-I-have-a-dream-site.jpg)](/wiki/File:I-have-a-dream-site.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:I-have-a-dream-site.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe location on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial from which King delivered\nthe speech is commemorated with this inscription\n\nThe March on Washington put pressure on the Kennedy administration to advance\n[its civil rights legislation](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964 \"Civil Rights\nAct of 1964\") in Congress.[49] The diaries of [Arthur M. Schlesinger\nJr.](/wiki/Arthur_M._Schlesinger_Jr. \"Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.\"), published\nposthumously in 2007, suggest that President Kennedy was concerned that if the\nmarch failed to attract large numbers of demonstrators, it might undermine his\ncivil rights efforts.\n\nIn the wake of the speech and march, King was named [Man of the\nYear](/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year \"Time Person of the Year\") by [_TIME_\nmagazine](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\) \"Time \\(magazine\\)\") for 1963, and in 1964,\nhe was the youngest person ever awarded the [Nobel Peace\nPrize](/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize \"Nobel Peace Prize\").[50] The full speech did\nnot appear in writing until August 1983, some 15 years after King's death,\nwhen a transcript was published in _[The Washington\nPost](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_.[4]\n\nIn 1990, the Australian [alternative comedy](/wiki/Alternative_comedy\n\"Alternative comedy\") rock band [Doug Anthony All\nStars](/wiki/Doug_Anthony_All_Stars \"Doug Anthony All Stars\") released an\nalbum called _[Icon](/wiki/DAAS_Icon \"DAAS Icon\")_. One song from _Icon_ ,\n\"Shang-a-lang\", sampled the end of the speech.\n\nIn 1992, the band [Moodswings](/wiki/Moodswings_\\(band\\) \"Moodswings\n\\(band\\)\"), incorporated excerpts from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a\nDream\" speech in their song \"Spiritual High, Part III. on the album\n[Moodfood](/wiki/Moodfood \"Moodfood\")\".\n\nIn 2002, the [Library of Congress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library of\nCongress\") honored the speech by adding it to the [United States National\nRecording\nRegistry](/wiki/List_of_recordings_preserved_in_the_United_States_National_Recording_Registry\n\"List of recordings preserved in the United States National Recording\nRegistry\").[51] In 2003, the [National Park\nService](/wiki/National_Park_Service \"National Park Service\") dedicated an\ninscribed marble pedestal to commemorate the location of King's speech at the\nLincoln Memorial.[52]\n\nThe [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial](/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Memorial\n\"Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial\") was dedicated in 2011. The centerpiece for\nthe memorial is based on a line from King's \"I Have A Dream\" speech: \"Out of a\nmountain of despair, a stone of hope.\"[53] A 30 feet (9.1 m)-high relief of\nKing named the \"Stone of Hope\" stands past two other pieces of granite that\nsymbolize the \"mountain of despair.\"[53]\n\nOn August 26, 2013, UK's [BBC Radio 4](/wiki/BBC_Radio_4 \"BBC Radio 4\")\nbroadcast \"God's Trombone\", in which [Gary Younge](/wiki/Gary_Younge \"Gary\nYounge\") looked behind the scenes of the speech and explored \"what made it\nboth timely and timeless\".[54]\n\nOn August 28, 2013, thousands gathered on the mall in Washington D.C. where\nKing made his historic speech to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the\noccasion. In attendance were former U.S. Presidents [Bill\nClinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\") and [Jimmy\nCarter](/wiki/Jimmy_Carter \"Jimmy Carter\"), and incumbent President [Barack\nObama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\"), who addressed the crowd and spoke\non the significance of the event. Many of King's family were in\nattendance.[55]\n\nOn October 11, 2015, _The Atlanta Journal-Constitution_ published an exclusive\nreport about [Stone Mountain](/wiki/Stone_Mountain \"Stone Mountain\") officials\nconsidering installation of a new \"Freedom Bell\" honoring King and citing the\nspeech's reference to the mountain \"Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of\nGeorgia.\"[56] Design details and a timeline for its installation remain to be\ndetermined. The article mentioned inspiration for the proposed monument came\nfrom a bell-ringing ceremony held in 2013 in celebration of the 50th\nanniversary of King's speech.\n\nOn April 20, 2016, [Treasury Secretary](/wiki/Treasury_Secretary \"Treasury\nSecretary\") [Jacob Lew](/wiki/Jacob_Lew \"Jacob Lew\") announced that the [U.S.\n$5 bill](/wiki/United_States_five-dollar_bill \"United States five-dollar\nbill\"), which has featured the Lincoln Memorial on its back, would undergo a\nredesign prior to 2020. Lew said that a portrait of Lincoln would remain on\nthe front of the bill, but the back would be redesigned to depict various\nhistorical events that have occurred at the memorial, including an image from\nKing's speech.[57]\n\nIn October 2016 [Science Friday](/wiki/Science_Friday \"Science Friday\") in a\nsegment on its [crowd sourced](/wiki/Crowd_sourced \"Crowd sourced\") update to\nthe [Voyager Golden Record](/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record \"Voyager Golden\nRecord\") included the speech.[58]\n\n## Copyright dispute\n\nBecause King's speech was broadcast to a large radio and television audience,\nthere was controversy about its copyright status. If the performance of the\nspeech constituted \"general publication\", it would have entered the [public\ndomain](/wiki/Public_domain \"Public domain\") due to King's failure to register\nthe speech with the [Register of Copyrights](/wiki/Register_of_Copyrights\n\"Register of Copyrights\"). However, if the performance only constituted\n\"limited publication\", King retained [common law\ncopyright](/wiki/Common_law_copyright \"Common law copyright\"). This led to a\nlawsuit, _[Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS,\nInc.](/wiki/Estate_of_Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.,_Inc._v._CBS,_Inc. \"Estate of\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc.\")_ , which established that the\nKing estate does hold copyright over the speech and had [standing to\nsue](/wiki/Standing_\\(law\\) \"Standing \\(law\\)\"); the parties then settled.\nUnlicensed use of the speech or a part of it can still be lawful in some\ncircumstances, especially in jurisdictions under doctrines such as [fair\nuse](/wiki/Fair_use \"Fair use\") or [fair dealing](/wiki/Fair_dealing \"Fair\ndealing\"). Under the applicable copyright laws, the speech will remain under\n[copyright in the United States](/wiki/Copyright_in_the_United_States\n\"Copyright in the United States\") until 70 years after King's death, therefore\nuntil 2038.[59]\n\n## Original copy of the speech\n\nAs King waved goodbye to the audience, he handed [George\nRaveling](/wiki/George_Raveling \"George Raveling\") the original typewritten \"I\nHave a Dream\" speech.[60] Raveling, an [All-American](/wiki/All-American \"All-\nAmerican\") [Villanova Wildcats](/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men%27s_basketball\n\"Villanova Wildcats men's basketball\") [college\nbasketball](/wiki/College_basketball \"College basketball\") player, had\nvolunteered as a security guard for the event and was on the podium with King\nat that moment.[61] In 2013, Raveling still had custody of the original copy,\nfor which he had been offered $3,000,000, but he has said he does not intend\nto sell it.[62][63]\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Special Collections, March on Washington, Part 17\"](http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/A_76C3B93B557D4976A032C27C72ACED18#at_89.00_s). _Open Vault_. at [WGBH](/wiki/WGBH_Educational_Foundation \"WGBH Educational Foundation\").
