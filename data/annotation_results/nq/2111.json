A stagehand named Joseph Buquet is found hanged and the rope around his\nneck goes missing. At a gala performance for the retirement of the opera\nhouse's two managers, a young little-known Swedish soprano, [Christine\nDaaé](/wiki/Christine_Daa%C3%A9 \"Christine Daaé\"), is called upon to sing in\nthe place of the Opera's leading soprano, Carlotta, who is ill, and her\nperformance is an astonishing success. The Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who was\npresent at the performance, recognises her as his childhood playmate, and\nrecalls his love for her. He attempts to visit her backstage, where he hears a\nman complimenting her from inside her dressing room. He investigates the room\nonce Christine leaves, only to find it empty.\n\nAt [Perros-Guirec](/wiki/Perros-Guirec \"Perros-Guirec\"), Christine meets with\nRaoul, who confronts her about the voice he heard in her room. Christine tells\nhim she has been tutored by the Angel of Music, whom her father used to tell\nthem about. When Raoul suggests that she might be the victim of a prank, she\nstorms off. Christine visits her father's grave one night, where a mysterious\nfigure appears and plays the violin for her. Raoul attempts to confront it but\nis attacked and knocked out in the process.\n\nBack at the Palais Garnier, the new managers receive a letter from the Phantom\ndemanding that they allow Christine to perform the lead role of Marguerite in\n_[Faust](/wiki/Faust_\\(opera\\) \"Faust \\(opera\\)\")_ , and that box 5 be left\nempty for his use, lest they perform in a house with a curse on it. The\nmanagers ignore his demands as a prank, resulting in disastrous consequences:\nCarlotta ends up croaking like a toad, and the chandelier suddenly drops into\nthe audience, killing a spectator. The Phantom, having abducted Christine from\nher dressing room, reveals himself as a deformed man called\n[Erik](/wiki/Erik_\\(The_Phantom_of_the_Opera\\) \"Erik \\(The Phantom of the\nOpera\\)\"). Erik intends to keep her in his lair with him for a few days, but\nshe causes him to change his plans when she unmasks him and, to the horror of\nboth, beholds his noseless, lipless, sunken-eyed face, which resembles a skull\ndried up by the centuries, covered in yellowed dead flesh.\n\nFearing that she will leave him, he decides to keep her with him forever, but\nwhen Christine requests release after two weeks, he agrees on condition that\nshe wear his ring and be faithful to him. On the roof of the opera house,\nChristine tells Raoul about her abduction, and makes Raoul promise to take her\naway to a place where Erik can never find her, even if she resists. Raoul\ntells Christine he will act on his promise the next day, to which she agrees.\nHowever, Christine sympathises with Erik, and decides to sing for him one last\ntime as a means of saying good-bye. Unbeknownst to Christine and Raoul, Erik\nhas been watching them and overheard their whole conversation.\n\nThe following night, the enraged and jealous Erik abducts Christine during a\nproduction of _Faust_ , and tries to force her to marry him. Raoul is led by a\nmysterious opera regular known as \"The Persian\" into Erik's secret lair deep\nin the bowels of the opera house, but they end up trapped into a mirrored room\nby Erik, who threatens that unless Christine agrees to marry him, he will kill\nthem and everyone in the Opera House by using explosives. Christine agrees to\nmarry Erik. Erik initially tries to drown Raoul and the Persian, using the\nwater which would have been used to douse the explosives, but Christine begs\nand offers to be his \"living bride\", promising him not to kill herself after\nbecoming his bride, as she had both contemplated and attempted earlier in the\nnovel. Erik eventually releases Raoul and the Persian from his torture\nchamber.\n\nWhen Erik is alone with Christine, he lifts his mask to kiss her on her\nforehead, and is given a kiss back. Erik reveals that he has never received a\nkiss, not even from his own mother, nor has been allowed to give one and is\novercome with emotion. He and Christine then cry together and their tears\n\"mingle\". Erik later says that he has never felt so close to another human\nbeing. He allows the Persian and Raoul to escape, though not before making\nChristine promise that she will visit him on his death day, and return the\ngold ring he gave her. He also makes the Persian promise that afterwards he\nwill go to the newspaper and report his death, as he will die soon and will\ndie \"of love\". Indeed, some time later Christine returns to Erik's lair,\nburies him somewhere he will never be found (by Erik's request) and returns\nthe gold ring. Afterwards, a local newspaper runs the simple note: \"Erik is\ndead\". Christine and Raoul (who finds out that Erik has killed his older\nbrother) elope together, never to return.\n\nPassages narrated directly by the Persian and the final chapter piece together\nErik's life: the son of a construction business owner deformed from birth, he\nran away from his native Normandy to work in fairs and in caravans, schooling\nhimself in the arts of the circus across Europe and Asia, and eventually\nbuilding trick palaces in Persia and Turkey. Eventually, he returned to France\nand, wearing a mask, started his own construction business. After being\nsubcontracted to work on the foundations of the Palais Garnier, Erik had\ndiscreetly built himself a lair to disappear in, complete with hidden passages\nand other tricks that allowed him to spy on the managers.\n\n##\nCharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Characters\")]\n\n  * [Erik](/wiki/Erik_\\(The_Phantom_of_the_Opera\\) \"Erik \\(The Phantom of the Opera\\)\"): The Phantom of the Opera, a deformed former conjuror also referred to as the Angel of Music and the Opera Ghost.
