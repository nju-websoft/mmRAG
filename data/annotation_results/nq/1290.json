 \n  \n_**Quantum of Solace: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack**_ is the soundtrack\nalbum for the [James Bond](/wiki/James_Bond \"James Bond\") film [of the same\nname](/wiki/Quantum_of_Solace \"Quantum of Solace\"). Released on 17 October\n2008. The album contains the score composed by [David\nArnold](/wiki/David_Arnold \"David Arnold\"). It is Arnold's fifth soundtrack\nfor the James Bond franchise. His frequent collaborator Nicholas Dodd\norchestrated and conducted the score.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Development\n  * 2 Track listing\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n\n##\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quantum_of_Solace_\\(soundtrack\\)&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n[David Arnold](/wiki/David_Arnold \"David Arnold\"), who composed the scores for\nthe previous four Bond films, said that _Quantum of Solace_ director [Marc\nForster](/wiki/Marc_Forster \"Marc Forster\") likes to work very closely with\nhis composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied\nto on _Casino Royale_ , the intention was to spend a long time scoring the\nfilm to \"really work it out\". He also said he would be \"taking a different\napproach\" with the score.[1] Arnold composed the music based on impressions\nfrom reading the script, and Forster edited those into the film.[2]\n\n[Mark Ronson](/wiki/Mark_Ronson \"Mark Ronson\") and [Amy\nWinehouse](/wiki/Amy_Winehouse \"Amy Winehouse\") recorded a\n[demo](/wiki/Demo_\\(music\\) \"Demo \\(music\\)\") track for the film,[3] but\nRonson explained that she was \"not ready to record any music\" at that time.[4]\nIt was announced [Jack White](/wiki/Jack_White_\\(musician\\) \"Jack White\n\\(musician\\)\") of [The White Stripes](/wiki/The_White_Stripes \"The White\nStripes\") and [Alicia Keys](/wiki/Alicia_Keys \"Alicia Keys\") would collaborate\non \"[Another Way to Die](/wiki/Another_Way_to_Die \"Another Way to Die\")\",\nwhich is the first duet in Bond music history, on 29 July 2008.[5][6] They had\nwanted to work together for two years beforehand.[7] The song was recorded in\n[Nashville, Tennessee](/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee \"Nashville, Tennessee\");\nWhite played the drums while Keys performed on the piano.[8] [The Memphis\nHorns](/wiki/The_Memphis_Horns \"The Memphis Horns\") also contributed to the\ntrack.[7] White's favourite Bond theme is [John\nBarry](/wiki/John_Barry_\\(composer\\) \"John Barry \\(composer\\)\")'s instrumental\npiece for _[On Her Majesty's Secret\nService](/wiki/On_Her_Majesty%27s_Secret_Service_\\(soundtrack\\) \"On Her\nMajesty's Secret Service \\(soundtrack\\)\")_, and he watched various opening\ncredit sequences from the series for inspiration while mixing the track.[8]\n\nThe soundtrack was released by [J Records](/wiki/J_Records \"J Records\"), Keys'\nrecord label, though Keys appears on only one track. The track listing follows\nthe order of the music's use within the film, with the exception of the title\nsong being moved to the end of the album (in the film, it appears immediately\nafter track 1). It is presented in the full-length single-release version,\nrather than the shorter mix heard over the film's opening titles. One notable\nomission is the fully orchestrated [James Bond Theme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme\n\"James Bond Theme\"), which features, as it did in _[Casino\nRoyale](/wiki/Casino_Royale_\\(2006_film\\) \"Casino Royale \\(2006 film\\)\")_ ,\nonly at the film's conclusion, but this time over the traditional [gunbarrel\nwalk-on-and-shoot](/wiki/James_Bond_gun_barrel_sequence \"James Bond gun barrel\nsequence\") as well as the start of the end titles. Another omission is [Four\nTet](/wiki/Four_Tet \"Four Tet\")'s instrumental closing theme that follows it,\nplaying over the remainder of the credits and entitled _Crawl, End Crawl_\nwithin them. This track was later made available on iTunes. Other tracks\nlisted are heard in the film (but not on the album) during scenes such as\n[Dominic Greene](/wiki/Dominic_Greene \"Dominic Greene\")'s charity fundraising\nparty _[Jaime Cuadra](/wiki/Jaime_Cuadra \"Jaime Cuadra\") \\- Cholo Soy_,\n_[Jaime Cuadra](/wiki/Jaime_Cuadra \"Jaime Cuadra\") \\- Regresa_, _[Jaime\nCuadra](/wiki/Jaime_Cuadra \"Jaime Cuadra\") \\- El Provinciano_; and\n[Puccini](/wiki/Puccini \"Puccini\")'s [opera](/wiki/Opera \"Opera\")\n_[Tosca](/wiki/Tosca \"Tosca\")_ forms the backdrop to a key sequence. _Vesper\n's Theme_ from Arnold's [_Casino Royale_\nsoundtrack](/wiki/Casino_Royale_\\(2006_soundtrack\\) \"Casino Royale \\(2006\nsoundtrack\\)\") reappears at key moments in the film; it may be heard on the\nalbum in tracks 12, 15, 18 and 23.\n\n## Track\nlisting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quantum_of_Solace_\\(soundtrack\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Track listing\")]\n\nAll music composed by [David Arnold](/wiki/David_Arnold \"David Arnold\") unless\nstated otherwise.\n\nNo.| Title| Length  \n---|---|---  \n1.| \"Time to Get Out\" (Contains the [James Bond Theme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme\n\"James Bond Theme\"), originally composed for the [Dr. No\nsoundtrack](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Dr. No \\(soundtrack\\)\"))| 3:28  \n2.| \"The Palio\"| 4:59  \n3.| \"Inside Man\" (Contains the [James Bond Theme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme\n\"James Bond Theme\"), originally composed for the [Dr. No\nsoundtrack](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Dr. No \\(soundtrack\\)\"))| 0:38  \n4.| \"Bond in Haiti\" (Contains the [James Bond Theme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme\n\"James Bond Theme\"), originally composed for the [Dr. No\nsoundtrack](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Dr. No \\(soundtrack\\)\"))| 0:35  \n5.| \"Somebody Wants to Kill You\"| 2:17  \n6.| \"Greene & Camille\"| 2:13  \n7.| \"Pursuit at Port au Prince\" (Contains the [James Bond\nTheme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme \"James Bond Theme\"), originally composed for the\n[Dr. No soundtrack](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Dr. No \\(soundtrack\\)\"))|\n5:58  \n8.| \"No Interest in Dominic Greene\"| 2:44  \n9.| \"Night at the Opera\"| 3:02  \n10.| \"Restrict Bond's Movements\"| 1:31  \n11.| \"Talamone\"| 0:35  \n12.| \"What's Keeping You Awake\"| 1:41  \n13.| \"Bolivian Taxi Ride\"| 0:49  \n14.| \"Field Trip\" (Contains the [James Bond Theme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme\n\"James Bond Theme\"), originally composed for the [Dr. No\nsoundtrack](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Dr. No \\(soundtrack\\)\"))| 0:41  \n15.| \"Forgive Yourself\"| 2:26  \n16.| \"DC3\"| 1:15  \n17.| \"Target Terminated\"| 3:54  \n18.| \"Camille's Story\"| 3:59  \n19.| \"Oil Fields\" (Contains the [James Bond Theme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme\n\"James Bond Theme\"), originally composed for the [Dr. No\nsoundtrack](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Dr. No \\(soundtrack\\)\"))| 2:29  \n20.| \"Have You Ever Killed Someone?\"| 1:33  \n21.| \"Perla de las Dunas\"| 8:08  \n22.| \"The Dead Don't Care About Vengeance\"| 1:14  \n23.| \"I Never Left\" (Contains the [James Bond Theme](/wiki/James_Bond_Theme\n\"James Bond Theme\"), originally composed for the [Dr. No\nsoundtrack](/wiki/Dr._No_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Dr. No \\(soundtrack\\)\"))| 0:40  \n24.| \"[Another Way to Die](/wiki/Another_Way_to_Die \"Another Way to Die\")\"\n(Performed by [Jack White](/wiki/Jack_White_\\(musician\\) \"Jack White\n\\(musician\\)\") and [Alicia Keys](/wiki/Alicia_Keys \"Alicia Keys\"))| 4:24  \n  \n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quantum_of_Solace_\\(soundtrack\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Outline of James Bond](/wiki/Outline_of_James_Bond \"Outline of James Bond\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Quantum_of_Solace_\\(soundtrack\\)&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Tommy Pearson, [David Arnold](/wiki/David_Arnold \"David Arnold\") (November 2007).
