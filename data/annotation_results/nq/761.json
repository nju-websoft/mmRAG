The series, which was produced with [20th Century Fox\nTelevision](/wiki/20th_Century_Fox_Television \"20th Century Fox Television\")\nfor CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the \"4077th\n[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital](/wiki/Mobile_Army_Surgical_Hospital \"Mobile\nArmy Surgical Hospital\")\" in [Uijeongbu](/wiki/Uijeongbu \"Uijeongbu\"), [South\nKorea](/wiki/South_Korea \"South Korea\"), during the [Korean\nWar](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\") (1950–53).

The series is usually categorized as a [situation\ncomedy](/wiki/Situation_comedy \"Situation comedy\"), though it has also been\ndescribed as a \"[dark comedy](/wiki/Black_comedy \"Black comedy\")\" or a\n\"[dramedy](/wiki/Comedy-drama \"Comedy-drama\")\" because of the often dramatic\nsubject matter.[a]\n\nThe show is an ensemble piece revolving around key personnel in a [United\nStates Army](/wiki/United_States_Army \"United States Army\") _[Mobile Army\nSurgical Hospital](/wiki/Mobile_Army_Surgical_Hospital \"Mobile Army Surgical\nHospital\")_ (MASH) in the Korean War (1950–53). (The\n[asterisks](/wiki/Asterisk \"Asterisk\") in the name are not part of military\nnomenclature and were creatively introduced in the novel and used in only the\nposters for the movie version, not the actual movie.)[_[clarification\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_] The\n\"4077th MASH\" was one of several surgical units in Korea.\n\nWhile the show is traditionally viewed as a comedy, many episodes had a more\nserious tone. Airing on network prime time while the [Vietnam\nWar](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\") was still going on, the show was forced\nto walk the fine line of commenting on that war while at the same time not\nseeming to protest it. For this reason, the show's discourse, under the cover\nof comedy, often questioned, mocked, and grappled with America's role in the\nCold War.\n\nEpisodes were both plot- and character-driven, with several narrated by one of\nthe show's characters as the contents of a letter home. The show's tone could\nmove from silly to sobering from one episode to the next, with dramatic\ntension often occurring between the civilian draftees of 4077th – Hawkeye,\nTrapper John, and B.J. Hunnicutt, for example – who are forced to leave their\nhomes to tend the wounded and dying of the war, and the \"regular Army\"\ncharacters, such as Margaret Houlihan and Colonel Potter, who tend to\nrepresent patriotism and duty (though Houlihan and Potter could also represent\nthe other perspective at times). Other characters, such as Col. Blake, Maj.\nWinchester, and Cpl. Klinger, help demonstrate various American civilian\nattitudes toward army life, while guest characters played by such actors as\n[Eldon Quick](/wiki/Eldon_Quick \"Eldon Quick\"), [Herb\nVoland](/wiki/Herb_Voland \"Herb Voland\"), [Mary Wickes](/wiki/Mary_Wickes\n\"Mary Wickes\"), and [Tim O'Connor](/wiki/Tim_O%27Connor_\\(actor\\) \"Tim\nO'Connor \\(actor\\)\") also help further the show's discussion of America's\nplace as Cold War warmaker and peacemaker.\n\n##\nCharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=M*A*S*H_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Characters\")]\n\n### Main\ncast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=M*A*S*H_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Main cast\")]\n\nMain article: [List of M*A*S*H characters](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_characters\n\"List of M*A*S*H characters\")\n\nSee also: [List of M*A*S*H cast members](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_cast_members\n\"List of M*A*S*H cast members\")\n\n_M*A*S*H_ maintained a relatively constant [ensemble cast](/wiki/Ensemble_cast\n\"Ensemble cast\"), with four characters – [Hawkeye](/wiki/Hawkeye_Pierce\n\"Hawkeye Pierce\"), [Father Mulcahy](/wiki/Father_Mulcahy \"Father Mulcahy\"),\n[Margaret Houlihan](/wiki/Margaret_Houlihan \"Margaret Houlihan\"), and [Maxwell\nKlinger](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_characters#Maxwell_Klinger \"List of M*A*S*H\ncharacters\") – on the show for all 11 seasons. Several other main characters\ndeparted or joined the program during its run, and numerous guest actors and\nrecurring characters were used. The writers found creating so many names\ndifficult, and used names from elsewhere; for example, characters on [the\nseventh season](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes_\\(season_7\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes \\(season 7\\)\") were named after the [1978 Los Angeles\nDodgers](/wiki/1978_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_season \"1978 Los Angeles Dodgers\nseason\").[1]\n\n  * Note: Character appearances include double-length episodes as two appearances, making 260 in total.\n\nCharacter  | Actor/actress  | Rank  | Role  | Appearances   \n---|---|---|---|---  \nHawkeye Pierce  | [Alan Alda](/wiki/Alan_Alda \"Alan Alda\") | [Captain](/wiki/Captain_\\(United_States_O-3\\) \"Captain \\(United States O-3\\)\") | [Chief surgeon](/wiki/Surgery \"Surgery\") | 251   \nMargaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan Penopscott  | [Loretta Swit](/wiki/Loretta_Swit \"Loretta Swit\") | [Major](/wiki/Major_\\(United_States\\) \"Major \\(United States\\)\") | Head [nurse](/wiki/Nurse \"Nurse\"),  \ntemporary [adjutant](/wiki/Adjutant \"Adjutant\") | 243   \nMax Klinger  \n(Recurring seasons 1–3, regular 4–11)  | [Jamie Farr](/wiki/Jamie_Farr \"Jamie Farr\") | [Corporal](/wiki/Corporal \"Corporal\"),  \nlater [sergeant](/wiki/Sergeant \"Sergeant\") | [Corpsman](/wiki/Corpsman \"Corpsman\"),  \nlater company clerk  | 219   \nFather John Patrick Francis Mulcahy  \n(recurring seasons 1–4, regular 5–11)  | [George Morgan](/w/index.php?title=George_Morgan_\\(actor\\)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"George Morgan \\(actor\\) \\(page does not exist\\)\") (pilot episode), replaced by [William Christopher](/wiki/William_Christopher \"William Christopher\") | [First lieutenant](/wiki/First_lieutenant \"First lieutenant\"),  \nlater [captain](/wiki/Captain_\\(United_States_O-3\\) \"Captain \\(United States O-3\\)\") | [Chaplain](/wiki/Chaplain \"Chaplain\") | 218   \nTrapper John McIntyre  \n(seasons 1–3)  | [Wayne Rogers](/wiki/Wayne_Rogers \"Wayne Rogers\") | Captain  | Surgeon  | 72 + 1 uncredited voiceover (\"[Welcome to Korea](/wiki/Welcome_to_Korea \"Welcome to Korea\")\")   \nHenry Blake  \n(seasons 1–3)  | [McLean Stevenson](/wiki/McLean_Stevenson \"McLean Stevenson\") | [Lieutenant colonel](/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel_\\(United_States\\) \"Lieutenant colonel \\(United States\\)\") | [Commanding officer](/wiki/Commanding_officer \"Commanding officer\"),  \nsurgeon  | 70   \nFrank Burns  \n(seasons 1–5)  | [Larry Linville](/wiki/Larry_Linville \"Larry Linville\") | Major,  \nlater lieutenant colonel (off-screen)  | Surgeon, [executive officer](/wiki/Executive_officer \"Executive officer\")   \ntemporary commanding officer (following the discharge of Henry Blake)  | 118   \nRadar O'Reilly  \n(seasons 1–8)  | [Gary Burghoff](/wiki/Gary_Burghoff \"Gary Burghoff\") | Corporal   \n(one episode as [second lieutenant](/wiki/Second_lieutenant \"Second lieutenant\") due to falsified promotion)  | Company clerk,  \n[bugler](/wiki/Bugler \"Bugler\") | 156   \nB.

This was a\nresult of changes in writing and production staff, rather than the cast\ndefections of McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville, Wayne Rogers and Gary\nBurghoff. Series co-creator and joke writer [Larry\nGelbart](/wiki/Larry_Gelbart \"Larry Gelbart\") departed after Season 4, the\nfirst featuring Mike Farrell and Harry Morgan. This resulted in Farrell and\nMorgan having only a single season reading scripts featuring Gelbart's\nmasterful comic timing, which defined the feel and rhythm of Seasons 1–4\nfeaturing predecessors Rogers and Stevenson, respectively. [Larry\nLinville](/wiki/Larry_Linville \"Larry Linville\") (the show's [comic\nfoil](/wiki/Comic_foil \"Comic foil\")) and Executive Producer [Gene\nReynolds](/wiki/Gene_Reynolds \"Gene Reynolds\") both departed at the conclusion\nof Season 5 in 1977, resulting in _M*A*S*H_ being fully stripped of its\noriginal tight comedic foundation by the beginning of Season 6 — the debut of\nthe Charles Winchester era.[2]\n\nWhereas Gelbart and Reynolds were the comedic voice of _M*A*S*H_ for the\nshow's first five seasons (1972–1977), [Alan Alda](/wiki/Alan_Alda \"Alan\nAlda\") and newly promoted Executive Producer [Burt\nMetcalfe](/wiki/Burt_Metcalfe \"Burt Metcalfe\") became the new dramatic voice\nof _M*A*S*H_ for Seasons 6–11. By the start of Season 8 (1979–1980), the\nwriting staff had been completely overhauled, and with the departure of Gary\nBurghoff, _M*A*S*H_ displayed a distinctively different feel, consciously\nmoving between comedy and drama, unlike the seamless integration of its first\nfive years.\n\nThe end of the Vietnam War in 1975 was a significant factor as to why\nstorylines become less political in nature and more character driven. Several\nepisodes also experimented with the sitcom format:\n\n  * \"Point of View\" – shown from the perspective of a soldier with a throat wound\n  * \"Dreams\" – an idea of Alda's, where during a deluge of casualties, members of the 4077 take naps on a rotation basis, allowing the viewer to see the simultaneously lyrical and disturbing dreams\n  * \"A War For All Seasons\" – features a storyline that takes place over the course of 1951\n  * \"Life Time\" – a precursor to the American television series _[24](/wiki/24_\\(TV_series\\) \"24 \\(TV series\\)\")_ , it utilizes the [real time](/wiki/Real_time_\\(media\\) \"Real time \\(media\\)\") method of narration[2]\n\nAnother change was the infusion of story lines based on actual events and\nmedical developments that materialized during the Korean War. Considerable\nresearch was done by the producers, including interviews with actual MASH\nsurgeons and personnel to develop story lines rooted in the war itself. Such\nearly 1950s events as [the McCarthy era](/wiki/McCarthyism \"McCarthyism\"),\nvarious sporting events, and the stardom of [Marilyn\nMonroe](/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe \"Marilyn Monroe\") were all incorporated into\nvarious episodes, a trend that continued until the end of the series.[2]\n\nWhile the series remained popular through these changes, it eventually began\nto run out of creative steam. Korean War doctors regularly contacted producers\nwith experiences that they thought might make for a good storyline, only to\nlearn the idea had previously been used. Harry Morgan admitted that he felt\n\"the cracks were starting to show\" by season 9 (1980–1981).[2] Alda wished to\nmake season 10 (1981-1982) _M*A*S*H_ 's last, but was persuaded by CBS to\nproduce a slightly shortened 11th season, coupled with a farewell movie\nfinale, because CBS refused to let the show go away so easily. In the end,\nseason 11 had 15 episodes (although six had been filmed during season 10 and\nheld over) and a 2-1/2 hour movie, which was treated as five episodes and was\nfilmed before the nine remaining episodes. The final episode ever produced was\nthe penultimate episode \"As Time Goes By\". The series finale movie, titled\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", became the most-watched television broadcast in\nhistory, tallying a total of 125 million viewers.[2]\n\n### Set\nlocation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=M*A*S*H_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Set location\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/MASH_site_-\n_Malibu_Creek_State_Park_-_2_January_2010.jpg/220px-MASH_site_-\n_Malibu_Creek_State_Park_-_2_January_2010.jpg)](/wiki/File:MASH_site_-\n_Malibu_Creek_State_Park_-_2_January_2010.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:MASH_site_-_Malibu_Creek_State_Park_-_2_January_2010.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nM*A*S*H site in Malibu Creek State Park. Hulk of a Dodge WC54 ambulance. Copy\nof the original M*A*S*H signpost was installed on the site in 2008.\n\nThe 4077th consisted of two separate sets. An outdoor set in the mountains\nnear [Malibu, California](/wiki/Malibu,_California \"Malibu, California\")\n(Calabasas, Los Angeles County, California) was used for most exterior and\ntent scenes for every season. This was the same set used to shoot the movie.\nThe indoor set, on a sound stage at Fox Studios in [Century\nCity](/wiki/Century_City,_California \"Century City, California\"), was used for\nthe indoor scenes for the run of the series. Later, after the indoor set was\nrenovated to permit many of the \"outdoor\" scenes to be filmed there, both sets\nwere used for exterior shooting as script requirements dictated (e.g., night\nscenes were far easier to film on the sound stage, but scenes at the chopper\npad required using the ranch).\n\nJust as the series was wrapping production, a brush fire destroyed most of the\noutdoor set on October 9, 1982. The fire was written into the final episode as\na forest fire caused by enemy [incendiary bombs](/wiki/Incendiary_bomb\n\"Incendiary bomb\") that forced the 4077th to bug out.\n\nThe Malibu location is today known as [Malibu Creek State\nPark](/wiki/Malibu_Creek_State_Park \"Malibu Creek State Park\"). Formerly\ncalled the Century Ranch and owned by 20th Century Fox Studios until the\n1980s, the site today is returning to a natural state, and is marked by a\nrusted Jeep and an ambulance used in the show. Through the 1990s, the area was\noccasionally used for television commercial production.\n\nOn February 23, 2008, series stars Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit and William\nChristopher (along with producers Gene Reynolds and Burt Metcalfe and\n_M*A*S*H_ director Charles S.

The exhibit\nwas extremely popular drawing more than 17,000 in a single week, a record for\nany Smithsonian display.[3]\n\nOn exhibit were The Swamp and Operating Room sets, one of the show's 14 Emmy\nAwards, early drafts of the pilot script, costumes from the show and other\nmemorabilia. Sets were decorated with props from the show including the iconic\nsignpost, Hawkeye's still and Major Winchester's [Webcor](/wiki/Webcor\n\"Webcor\") tape recorder and phonograph. The exhibit also encouraged visitors\nto compare the show to real Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals of the Korean and\nthe Vietnam Wars.

A different innovation was the show's producers' desire\nnot to have a [laugh track](/wiki/Laugh_track \"Laugh track\"), contrary to the\nnetwork's desire to have one. They compromised by omitting laughter in the\nscenes set in the operating room. The DVD releases of the series allow viewers\nto select an audio version with no laugh track.\n\nIn his blog, writer Ken Levine revealed that on one occasion, when the cast\noffered too many nitpicking \"notes\" on a script, his writing partner and he\nchanged the script to a \"cold show\" – one set during the frigid Korean winter.\nThe cast then had to stand around barrel fires in parkas at the Malibu ranch\nwhen the temperatures neared 100 °F (38 °C). Levine says, \"This happened maybe\ntwice, and we never got a ticky-tack note again.\"[8]\n\n[Jackie Cooper](/wiki/Jackie_Cooper \"Jackie Cooper\") wrote that Alan Alda,\nwhom Cooper directed in several episodes during the first two seasons,\nconcealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and the two of them barely\nspoke to each other by the time Cooper's tenure on the show ended.[9]\n\n###\nVehicles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=M*A*S*H_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Vehicles\")]\n\nThe helicopters used on the series were model [H-13 Sioux](/wiki/H-13_Sioux\n\"H-13 Sioux\") (military designation and nickname of the [Bell\n47](/wiki/Bell_47 \"Bell 47\") civilian model). As in the film, some care seems\nto have been taken to use the correct model of the long-lived\n[Bell](/wiki/Bell_Helicopter \"Bell Helicopter\") 47 series. In the opening\ncredits and many of the episodes, Korean War-vintage H-13Ds and Es (Bell\n47D-1s) were used complete with period-correct external\n[litters](/wiki/Litter_\\(rescue_basket\\) \"Litter \\(rescue basket\\)\"). A later\n(1954–73) 47G occasionally made an appearance. The helicopters are similar in\nappearance (with the later \"G\" models having larger two-piece fuel tanks, a\nslightly revised cabin, and other changes) with differences noticeable only to\na serious helicopter fan. In the pilot episode, a later Bell 47J (production\nbegan in 1957) was shown flying Henry Blake to Seoul, en route to a meeting\nwith General Hammond in Tokyo.[10] A [Sud Aviation Allouette\nII](/wiki/A%C3%A9rospatiale_Alouette_II \"Aérospatiale Alouette II\") helicopter\nwas also shown transporting Henry Blake to the 4077th in the episode \"Henry,\nPlease Come Home\".\n\nThe [Jeeps](/wiki/Jeep \"Jeep\") used were 1953 military M38 or civil CJ2A\n[Willys](/wiki/Willys \"Willys\") Jeeps and also World War II Ford GPWs and\nWillys MB's. Two episodes featured the M38A1 Jeep, one of which was stolen\nfrom a General by Radar and Hawkeye after their Jeep was stolen. Two of the\nambulances were [WC-54](/wiki/WC-54 \"WC-54\") Dodges and one was a\n[WC-27](/wiki/Dodge_WC_series \"Dodge WC series\"). A WC-54 ambulance remains at\nthe site and was burned in the Malibu fires on October 9, 1982, while a second\nWC-27 survives at a South El Monte museum without any markings. The bus used\nto transport the wounded was a 1954 [Ford](/wiki/Ford \"Ford\") model.

Though CBS initially\nrejected the idea, a compromise was reached that allowed for omitting the\nlaughter during operating room scenes if desired. \"We told the network that\nunder no circumstances would we ever can laughter during an OR scene when the\ndoctors were working,\" said Gelbart in 1998. \"It’s hard to imagine that 300\npeople were in there laughing at somebody’s guts being sewn up.\"[11]\n\nSeasons 1–5 utilized a more invasive laugh track; a more subdued audience was\nemployed for Seasons 6–11 when the series shifted from sitcom to comedy-drama\nwith the departure of Gelbart and Reynolds. Several episodes (\"O.R.\", \"The\nBus\", \"Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?\", \"The Interview\", \"Point of View\" and\n\"Dreams\" among them) omitted the laugh track altogether; as did almost all of\nSeason 11, including the 135-minute series finale, \"[Goodbye, Farewell and\nAmen](/wiki/Goodbye,_Farewell_and_Amen \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\")\".[12] The\nlaugh track is also omitted from some international and syndicated airings of\nthe show; on one occasion during an airing on [BBC2](/wiki/BBC_Two \"BBC Two\"),\nthe laugh track was accidentally left on, and viewers expressed their\ndispleasure, an apology from the network for the \"technical difficulty\" was\nlater released, as during its original run on BBC2 in the UK, it was shown\nwithout the laugh track. UK DVD critics speak poorly of the laugh track,\nstating \"canned laughter is intrusive at the best of times, but with a\nprogramme like _M*A*S*H_ , it's downright unbearable.\"[13]\n\nOn all released DVDs, both in Region 1 (including the US and Canada) and\nRegion 2 (Europe, including the UK), an option is given to watch the show with\nor without the laugh track.[14][15]\n\n\"They're a lie,\" said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. \"You're telling an engineer\nwhen to push a button to produce a laugh from people who don't exist. It's\njust so dishonest. The biggest shows when we were on the air were _[All in the\nFamily](/wiki/All_in_the_Family \"All in the Family\")_ and _[The Mary Tyler\nMoore Show](/wiki/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\")_ both\nof which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense,\"\ncontinued Gelbart. \"But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the\nmiddle of [Korea](/wiki/Korea \"Korea\"). So the question I always asked the\nnetwork was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'\"\nGelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without\nthe laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's\nenjoyment. \"So you know what they said?\" Gelbart said. \"'Since there's no\ndifference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no\nsense of humor.\"[12] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, \"I always\nthought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for\ndinner.\"[16]\n\n##\nEpisodes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=M*A*S*H_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Episodes\")]\n\n### Episode\nlist[[edit](/w/index.php?title=M*A*S*H_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Episode list\")]\n\nMain article: [List of M*A*S*H episodes](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes \"List\nof M*A*S*H episodes\")\n\nSeason| Episodes| Originally aired| [Nielsen ratings](/wiki/Nielsen_ratings\n\"Nielsen ratings\")[17]  \n---|---|---|---  \nFirst aired| Last aired| Rank| Rating  \n| [1](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_1_\\(1972–73\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 24| September 17, 1972 (1972-09-17)| March 25, 1973 (1973-03-25)|\nN/A| N/A  \n| [2](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_2_\\(1973–74\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 24| September 15, 1973 (1973-09-15)| March 2, 1974 (1974-03-02)|\n4| 25.7  \n| [3](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_3_\\(1974–75\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 24| September 10, 1974 (1974-09-10)| March 18, 1975 (1975-03-18)|\n5| 27.4  \n| [4](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_4_\\(1975–76\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 25| September 12, 1975 (1975-09-12)| February 24, 1976\n(1976-02-24)| 14| 22.9[b]  \n| [5](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_5_\\(1976–77\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 25| September 21, 1976 (1976-09-21)| March 15, 1977 (1977-03-15)|\n4| 25.9  \n| [6](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_6_\\(1977–78\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 25| September 20, 1977 (1977-09-20)| March 27, 1978 (1978-03-27)|\n8| 23.2[c]  \n| [7](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_7_\\(1978–79\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 26| September 18, 1978 (1978-09-18)| March 12, 1979 (1979-03-12)|\n7| 25.4  \n| [8](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_8_\\(1979–80\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 25| September 17, 1979 (1979-09-17)| March 24, 1980 (1980-03-24)|\n4| 25.3[c]  \n| [9](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_9_\\(1980–81\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 20| November 17, 1980 (1980-11-17)| May 4, 1981 (1981-05-04)| 4|\n25.7  \n| [10](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_10_\\(1981–82\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 22| October 26, 1981 (1981-10-26)| April 12, 1982 (1982-04-12)| 9|\n22.3  \n| [11](/wiki/List_of_M*A*S*H_episodes#Season_11_\\(1982–83\\) \"List of M*A*S*H\nepisodes\")| 16| October 25, 1982 (1982-10-25)| February 28, 1983 (1983-02-28)|\n3| 22.6[d]  \n  \n  1. **Jump up ^** The term \"dramedy\" (drama + comedy), although coined in 1978, was not in common usage until after _M*A*S*H_ had gone off the air.\n  2. **Jump up ^** Tied with _[The Waltons](/wiki/The_Waltons \"The Waltons\")_\n  3. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Tied with _[Alice](/wiki/Alice_\\(TV_series\\) \"Alice \\(TV series\\)\")_\n  4. **Jump up ^** Tied with _[Magnum, P.I.](/wiki/Magnum,_P.I. \"Magnum, P.I.\")_\n\n### Final episode: \"Goodbye, Farewell and\nAmen\"[[edit](/w/index.php?title=M*A*S*H_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Final episode: \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\"\")]\n\nMain article: [Goodbye, Farewell and Amen](/wiki/Goodbye,_Farewell_and_Amen\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\")\n\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" was the final episode of _M*A*S*H_.

Stories persist that\nthe episode was seen by so many people that the New York City\nSanitation/Public Works Department reported the plumbing systems broke down in\nsome parts of the city from so many New Yorkers waiting until the end to use\nthe toilet. Articles copied into Alan Alda's book _The Last Days of M*A*S*H_\ninclude interviews with New York City Sanitation workers citing the spike in\nwater use on that night. According to the interviews at 11:03 pm, EST New York\nCity public works noted the highest water usage at one given time in the\nCity's history.
