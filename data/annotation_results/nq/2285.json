It followed the [Bank of North\nAmerica](/wiki/Bank_of_North_America \"Bank of North America\"), the nation's\nfirst _de facto_ [central bank](/wiki/Central_bank \"Central bank\").\n\nEstablishment of the Bank of the United States was part of a three-part\nexpansion of federal fiscal and monetary power, along with a federal mint and\nexcise taxes, championed by [Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton\n\"Alexander Hamilton\"), first [Secretary of the\nTreasury](/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury \"Secretary of the Treasury\").\nHamilton believed a national bank was necessary to stabilize and improve the\nnation's credit, and to improve handling of the financial business of the\nUnited States government under the newly enacted\n[Constitution](/wiki/US_Constitution \"US Constitution\").\n\nThe First Bank building, located in [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia\n\"Philadelphia\"), [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"), within\n[Independence National Historical\nPark](/wiki/Independence_National_Historical_Park \"Independence National\nHistorical Park\"), was completed in 1797, and is a [National Historic\nLandmark](/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark \"National Historic Landmark\") for\nits historic and architectural significance.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Proposal\n  * 3 Opposition\n  * 4 Presidential approval\n  * 5 Expiration of charter\n  * 6 Purchase by Girard\n  * 7 Bank building\n  * 8 See also\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 Further reading\n  * 11 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Bank_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\nIn 1791, The First Bank of the United States was one of the four major\nfinancial innovations proposed and supported by Hamilton, first Secretary of\nthe Treasury. In addition to the national bank, the other measures were\nassumption of the state war debts by the U.S. Government, establishment of a\nmint and imposition of a federal excise tax. The goals of Hamilton's three\nmeasures were to:[2]\n\n  * Establish financial order, clarity and precedence in and of the newly formed United States.\n  * Establish credit—both in country and overseas—for the new nation.\n  * Resolve the issue of the [fiat currency](/wiki/Fiat_money \"Fiat money\"), issued by the Continental Congress immediately prior to and during the [American Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary War\")—the \"[Continental](/wiki/Continental_\\(currency\\) \"Continental \\(currency\\)\")\".\n\nIn simpler words, Hamilton's four goals were to\n\n  * Have the Federal Government assume the Revolutionary War debts of the several states\n  * Pay off the war debts\n  * Raise money for the new government[3]\n  * Establish a national bank and create a common currency[4]\n\n\"The tendency of a national bank is to increase public and private credit. The\nformer gives power to the state for the protection of its rights and\ninterests, and the latter facilitates and extends the operations of commerce\namongst individuals.\"\n\nAlexander Hamilton, December, 1790 report to George Washington[5]\n\n##\nProposal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Bank_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Proposal\")]\n\nAccording to the plan put before the first session of the [First\nCongress](/wiki/First_Congress \"First Congress\") in 1790, Hamilton proposed\nestablishing the initial funding for the First Bank of the United States\nthrough the sale of $10 million in stock of which the United States government\nwould purchase the first $2 million in shares. Hamilton, foreseeing the\nobjection that this could not be done since the U.S. government did not have\n$2 million, proposed that the government make the stock purchase using money\nlent to it by the bank; the loan to be paid back in ten equal annual\ninstallments. The remaining $8 million of stock would be available to the\npublic, both in the United States and overseas. The chief requirement of these\nnon-government purchases was that one-quarter of the purchase price had to be\npaid in gold or silver; the remaining balance could be paid in bonds,\nacceptable scrip, etc.[6]\n\nBy continuously insisting on these conditions, the First Bank of the United\nStates might technically possess $500,000 in \"real\" money that it could, and\nwould, use as security to make loans up to its capitalized limit of $10\nmillion.[7] However, unlike the [Bank of England](/wiki/Bank_of_England \"Bank\nof England\"), the primary function of the bank would be credit issued to\ngovernment and private interests, for [internal\nimprovements](/wiki/Internal_improvements \"Internal improvements\") and other\neconomic development, per Hamilton's system of [Public\nCredit](/wiki/First_Report_on_the_Public_Credit \"First Report on the Public\nCredit\"). The business it would be involved in on behalf of the federal\ngovernment—a depository for collected taxes, making short term loans to the\ngovernment to cover real or potential temporary income gaps, serving as a\nholding site for both incoming and outgoing monies—was considered highly\nimportant but still secondary in nature.[8]\n\nThere were other, nonnegotiable conditions for the establishment of the First\nBank of the United States. Among these were:[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n  * That the bank would have a twenty-year charter running from 1791 to 1811, after which time it would be up to the Congress to approve or deny renewal of the bank and its charter; however, during that time no other federal bank would be authorized; states, for their part, would be free to charter however many intrastate banks they wished.\n  * That the bank, to avoid any appearance of impropriety, would: \n    1. be forbidden to buy government bonds.\n    2. have a mandatory rotation of directors.\n    3. neither issue notes nor incur debts beyond its actual capitalization.\n  * That foreigners, whether overseas or residing in the United States, would be allowed to be First Bank of the United States stockholders, but would not be allowed to vote.\n  * That the Secretary of the Treasury would be free to remove government deposits, inspect the books, and require statements regarding the bank's condition as frequently as once a week.[9]\n\nTo ensure that the government could meet both the current and future demands\nof its governmental accounts, an additional source of funding was required,\n\"for interest payments on the assumed state debts would begin to fall due at\nthe end of 1791...those payments would require $788,333 annually, and... an\nadditional $38,291 was needed to cover deficiencies in the funds that had been\nappropriated for existing commitments.\"[10] To achieve this, Hamilton repeated\na suggestion he had made nearly a year before—increase the duty on imported\nspirits, plus raise the excise tax on domestically distilled whiskey and other\nliquors. Local opposition to the tax led to the [Whiskey\nRebellion](/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion \"Whiskey Rebellion\").\n\n##\nOpposition[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Bank_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Opposition\")]\n\n\"Hamilton’s financial system had then passed. It had two objects; 1st, as a\npuzzle, to exclude popular understanding and inquiry; 2nd, as a machine for\nthe corruption of the legislature; for he avowed the opinion, that man could\nbe governed by one of two motives only, force or interest; force, he observed,\nin this country was out of the question, and the interests, therefore, of the\nmembers must be laid hold of, to keep the legislative in unison with the\nexecutive. And with grief and shame it must be acknowledged that his machine\nwas not without effect; that even in this, the birth of our government, some\nmembers were found sordid enough to bend their duty to their interests, and to\nlook after personal rather than public good. \"It is well known that during the\nwar the greatest difficulty we encountered was the want of money or means to\npay our soldiers who fought, or our farmers, manufacturers and merchants, who\nfurnished the necessary supplies of food and clothing for them. After the\nexpedient of paper money had exhausted itself, certificates of debt were given\nto the individual creditors, with assurance of payment so soon as the United\nStates should be able. But the distresses of [p. 272] these people often\nobliged them to part with these for the half, the fifth, and even a tenth of\ntheir value; and speculators had made a trade of cozening them from the\nholders by the most fraudulent practices, and persuasions that they would\nnever be paid. In the bill for funding and paying these, Hamilton made no\ndifference between the original holders and the fraudulent purchasers of this\npaper.\"\n\n[Thomas Jefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\"), February 4\nentry in _The Anas_[11]\n\n\"Let the American people go into their debt-funding schemes and banking\nsystems, and from that hour their [boasted\nindependence](/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence \"United States\nDeclaration of Independence\") will be a mere phantom.\"\n\n[William Pitt](/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger \"William Pitt the Younger\"),\nPrime Minister of Great Britain[12]\n\nHamilton's bank proposal faced widespread resistance from opponents of\nincreased federal power. [Secretary of State](/wiki/US_Secretary_of_State \"US\nSecretary of State\") [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson#Secretary_of_State \"Thomas Jefferson\") and\n[James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison#Founding_the_Democratic-Republican_party\n\"James Madison\") led the opposition, which claimed that the bank was\nunconstitutional, and that it benefited merchants and investors at the expense\nof the majority of the population.\n\nLike most of the Southern members of Congress,[13] Jefferson and Madison also\nopposed a second of the three proposals of Hamilton: establishing an official\ngovernment Mint. They believed this centralization of power away from local\nbanks was dangerous to a sound monetary system and was mostly to the benefit\nof business interests in the commercial north, not southern agricultural\ninterests, arguing that the right to own property would be infringed by these\nproposals. Furthermore, they contended that the creation of such a bank\nviolated the Constitution, which specifically stated that congress was to\nregulate weights and measures and issue coined money (rather than mint and\nbills of credit).[14]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/ASTOR%2C_John_Jacob_%28signed_check%29.jpg/238px-\nASTOR%2C_John_Jacob_%28signed_check%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:ASTOR,_John_Jacob_\\(signed_check\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:ASTOR,_John_Jacob_\\(signed_check\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBank of the United States check signed by [John Jacob\nAstor](/wiki/John_Jacob_Astor \"John Jacob Astor\") in 1792\n\nThe first part of the bill, the concept and establishment of a national mint,\nmet with no real objection, and sailed through; it was assumed the second and\nthird part (the bank and an excise tax to finance it) would likewise glide\nthrough, and in their own way they did: The House version of the bill, despite\nsome heated objections, easily passed. The Senate version of the bill did\nlikewise, with considerably fewer, and milder, objections. It was when \"the\ntwo bills changed houses, complications set in. In the Senate, Hamilton's\nsupporters objected to the House's alteration of the plans for the excise\ntax.\"[7]\n\nThe establishment of the bank also raised early questions of constitutionality\nin the new government. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, argued that\nthe bank was an effective means to utilize the authorized powers of the\ngovernment implied under the law of the Constitution. Secretary of State\nThomas Jefferson argued that the bank violated traditional property laws and\nthat its relevance to constitutionally authorized powers was weak. Another\nargument came from James Madison, who believed Congress had not received the\npower to incorporate a bank, or any other governmental agency. His argument\nrested primarily on the Tenth Amendment: that all powers not endowed to\nCongress are retained by the States (or the people). Additionally, his belief\nwas that if the Constitution's writers had wanted Congress to have such power,\nthey would have made it explicit. The decision would ultimately fall on\nPresident [George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\"),\nfollowing his deliberate investigation of the cabinet members' opinions.[15]\n\n## Presidential\napproval[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Bank_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Presidential approval\")]\n\nGeorge Washington initially declared that he was hesitant to sign the \"bank\nbill\" into law. Washington asked for the written advice and supporting reasons\nfrom all his cabinet members—most particularly from Hamilton. Attorney General\n[Edmund Randolph](/wiki/Edmund_Randolph \"Edmund Randolph\") from Virginia felt\nthat the bill was unconstitutional. Jefferson, also from Virginia, agreed that\nHamilton's proposal was against both the spirit and letter of the\nConstitution. Hamilton, who, unlike his fellow cabinet members, came from New\nYork, quickly responded to those who claimed incorporation of the bank\nunconstitutional. While Hamilton's rebuttals were many and varied, chief among\nthem were these two:\n\n  * What the government could do for a person (incorporate), it could not refuse to do for an \"artificial person\", a business. And the First Bank of the United States, being privately owned and not a government agency, was a business. \"Thus...unquestionably incident to sovereign power to erect corporations to _that_ of the United States, in _relation to the objects_ entrusted to the management of the government.\"\n  * Any government by its very nature was sovereign \"and includes by _force_ of the _term_ a right to attainment of the _ends...which are not precluded by restrictions & exceptions specified in the constitution..._[16]\n\nOn February 25, 1791, convinced that the constitution authorized the\nmeasure,[15] Washington signed the \"bank bill\" into law.\n\nOn March 19, 1791 Washington appointed three Commissioners for the taking of\nsubscriptions for this new bank: [Thomas Willing](/wiki/Thomas_Willing \"Thomas\nWilling\"), [David Rittenhouse](/wiki/David_Rittenhouse \"David Rittenhouse\"),\nand [Samuel Howell](/wiki/Samuel_Howell \"Samuel Howell\").[17]\n\n## Expiration of\ncharter[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Bank_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Expiration of charter\")]\n\nAfter Hamilton [left office](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton#Affair \"Alexander\nHamilton\") in 1795, the new Secretary of the Treasury [Oliver Wolcott,\nJr.](/wiki/Oliver_Wolcott,_Jr. \"Oliver Wolcott, Jr.\") informed Congress that,\ndue to the existing state of government finances, more money was needed. This\ncould be achieved either by selling the government's shares of stock in the\nbank, or by raising taxes. Wolcott advised the first choice. Congress quickly\nagreed. Hamilton objected, believing that the dividends on that stock had been\ninviolably pledged for the support of the sinking fund to retire the debt.\nHamilton tried to organize opposition to the measure, but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1811, the U.S. Senate tied on a vote to renew the bank's charter. Vice\nPresident [George Clinton](/wiki/George_Clinton_\\(vice_president\\) \"George\nClinton \\(vice president\\)\") broke the tie and voted against renewal. The\nbank's charter thus expired in 1811.\n\nIn 1816, the bank was succeeded by the [Second Bank of the United\nStates](/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States \"Second Bank of the United\nStates\").\n\n## Purchase by\nGirard[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Bank_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Purchase by Girard\")]\n\nAfter the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired in 1811,\n[Stephen Girard](/wiki/Stephen_Girard \"Stephen Girard\") purchased most of its\nstock as well as the building and its furnishings on South Third Street in\nPhiladelphia and opened his own bank, later known as [Girard\nBank](/wiki/Girard_Bank \"Girard Bank\"). Girard hired George Simpson, the\ncashier of the First Bank of the United States, as cashier of the new bank,\nand with seven other employees, opened for business on May 18, 1812. He\nallowed the Trustees of the First Bank of the United States to use some\noffices and space in the vaults to continue the process of winding down the\naffairs of the closed bank at a very nominal rent.[18]\n\nOver its early history the bank was known as “Girard’s Bank,”[19] or as\n“Girard Bank” [20] or also as “Stephen Girard’s Bank” or even the “Bank of\nStephen Girard.” [19] Girard was the sole proprietor of his bank, and thus\navoided the Pennsylvania state law which prohibited an unincorporated\nassociation of persons from establishing a bank, and which required a charter\nfrom the legislature for a banking corporation.[21]\n\n## Bank\nbuilding[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Bank_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Bank building\")]\n\n[![Refer to\ncaption.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/First_Bank_of_the_United_States%2C_120_South_Third_Street%2C_Philadelphia%2C_Philadelphia_County%2C_PA_HABS_PA%2C51-PHILA%2C235-_%28sheet_1_of_1%29.png/220px-\nFirst_Bank_of_the_United_States%2C_120_South_Third_Street%2C_Philadelphia%2C_Philadelphia_County%2C_PA_HABS_PA%2C51-PHILA%2C235-_%28sheet_1_of_1%29.png)](/wiki/File:First_Bank_of_the_United_States,_120_South_Third_Street,_Philadelphia,_Philadelphia_County,_PA_HABS_PA,51-PHILA,235-_\\(sheet_1_of_1\\).png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:First_Bank_of_the_United_States,_120_South_Third_Street,_Philadelphia,_Philadelphia_County,_PA_HABS_PA,51-PHILA,235-_\\(sheet_1_of_1\\).png\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nMeasured drawing of the First Bank from the Historic American Buildings\nSurvey.[22]\n\nThe First Bank of the United States was established in\n[Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\"),\n[Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"), while the city served as\nthe national capital, from 1790 to 1800. In the eighteenth century,\nPhiladelphia was one of the largest cities in the English-speaking world. The\nbank began operations in [Carpenters' Hall](/wiki/Carpenters%27_Hall\n\"Carpenters' Hall\") in 1791, some 200 feet from its permanent home.\n\nDesign of the bank building is credited to Samuel Blodgett, Superintendent of\nBuildings for the new capital in Washington, DC.,[23] although it has also\nbeen attributed to [James Hoban](/wiki/James_Hoban \"James Hoban\").[24][25] It\nwas completed in 1795.[26]\n\nThe First Bank of the United States has received various designations as a\nhistoric building. It was included in [Independence National Historical\nPark](/wiki/Independence_National_Historical_Park \"Independence National\nHistorical Park\") when the park was formed in 1956. The building's\narchitecture was studied by the [Historic American Buildings\nSurvey](/wiki/Historic_American_Buildings_Survey \"Historic American Buildings\nSurvey\") in 1958.[24] With the rest of Independence National Historical Park,\nit was listed on the [National Register of Historic\nPlaces](/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places \"National Register of\nHistoric Places\") on October 15, 1966, and the bank was then declared a\n[National Historic Landmark](/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark \"National\nHistoric Landmark\") on May 4, 1987. It is described in the landmark\ndesignation as an early masterpiece of monumental Classical Revival\ndesign.[27]\n\nUntil about 2000, the building housed offices for Independence National\nHistorical Park. A proposal to have it house the collection of the\nPhiladelphia Civil War Museum was abandoned when funding from the state of\nPennsylvania was not forthcoming.[28] Future plans are for it to house the\nNational Park Service archaeology lab, currently across the street in the old\nVisitor Center.\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Bank_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Libertybell_alone_small.jpg/22px-Libertybell_alone_small.jpg)[Philadelphia portal](/wiki/Portal:Philadelphia \"Portal:Philadelphia\")\n\n  * [Bank Bill of 1791](/wiki/Bank_Bill_of_1791 \"Bank Bill of 1791\")\n  * [Federal Reserve Act](/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act \"Federal Reserve Act\")\n  * [History of central banking in the United States](/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States \"History of central banking in the United States\")\n  * [United States Department of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury \"United States Department of the Treasury\")\n  * [Stephen Simpson (writer)](/wiki/Stephen_Simpson_\\(writer\\) \"Stephen Simpson \\(writer\\)\") Outspoken journalist and fierce critic of the 1st Natl Bank and its practices.\n  * [List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia](/wiki/List_of_National_Historic_Landmarks_in_Philadelphia \"List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia\")\n  * [National Register of Historic Places listings in Center City, Philadelphia](/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Center_City,_Philadelphia \"National Register of Historic Places listings in Center City, Philadelphia\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=First_Bank_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [National Park Service](/wiki/National_Park_Service \"National Park Service\") (2006-03-15).
