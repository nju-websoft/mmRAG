The series, initially\nbroadcast by [The WB](/wiki/The_WB \"The WB\"), premiered on October 16, 2001.\nAfter _Smallville_ 's [fifth season](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_5\\) \"Smallville\n\\(season 5\\)\"), The WB and [UPN](/wiki/UPN \"UPN\") merged to form [The\nCW](/wiki/The_CW \"The CW\"), the series' later United States broadcaster.\n_Smallville_ , which ended its [tenth and final\nseason](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_10\\) \"Smallville \\(season 10\\)\") on May 13,\n2011, follows [Clark Kent](/wiki/Clark_Kent_\\(Smallville\\) \"Clark Kent\n\\(Smallville\\)\") ([Tom Welling](/wiki/Tom_Welling \"Tom Welling\")) in the\nfictional town of [Smallville](/wiki/Smallville_\\(comics\\) \"Smallville\n\\(comics\\)\"), [Kansas](/wiki/Kansas \"Kansas\"), before he becomes known as\nSuperman. The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends in high\nschool. After season five _Smallville_ ventures into adult settings,\neventually focusing on his career at the _[Daily Planet](/wiki/Daily_Planet\n\"Daily Planet\")_ and introducing other DC comic-book\n[superheroes](/wiki/Superhero \"Superhero\") and [villains](/wiki/Supervillain\n\"Supervillain\").\n\nBefore the series' production, [_Bruce Wayne_](/wiki/Bruce_Wayne_\\(TV_series\\)\n\"Bruce Wayne \\(TV series\\)\"), chronicling the young protagonist's journey\ntoward [Batman](/wiki/Batman \"Batman\"), was proposed first. Although that\nseries failed to generate interest, it inspired _Smallville_. Series\ndevelopers Gough and Millar pitched their \"no tights, no flights\" rule to the\npresident of [Warner Bros. Television](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television \"Warner\nBros. Television\"), reducing Superman to the bare essentials and examining\nwhat led Clark Kent to become the Man of Steel. After seven seasons with the\nshow, Gough and Millar departed with little explanation. _Smallville_ was\nprimarily filmed in and around [Vancouver, British\nColumbia](/wiki/Vancouver,_British_Columbia \"Vancouver, British Columbia\"),\nwith local businesses and buildings substituting for Smallville locations.\nMost of the music for the first six seasons was composed by [Mark\nSnow](/wiki/Mark_Snow \"Mark Snow\"), who incorporated elements of [John\nWilliams](/wiki/John_Williams \"John Williams\")' musical score from the\n[_Superman_ film series](/wiki/Superman_in_film \"Superman in film\"). In\n[season seven](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_7\\) \"Smallville \\(season 7\\)\"), Louis\nFebre (who worked with Snow from the beginning) became the series' primary\ncomposer.\n\n_Smallville_ was generally positively received when it began. Former\n_Superman_ star [Christopher Reeve](/wiki/Christopher_Reeve \"Christopher\nReeve\") expressed approval for the series, making two guest appearances before\nhis death. The [pilot episode](/wiki/Pilot_\\(Smallville\\) \"Pilot\n\\(Smallville\\)\") set a ratings record for a WB debut, with 8.4 million\nviewers. Over ten seasons the series averaged about 4.34 million viewers per\nepisode, with [season two](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_2\\) \"Smallville \\(season\n2\\)\") the highest-rated at 6.3 million. By the end of its run, _Smallville_\npassed _[Stargate SG-1](/wiki/Stargate_SG-1 \"Stargate SG-1\")_ as the longest-\nrunning North American science-fiction series.[2] Since its [first\nseason](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_1\\) \"Smallville \\(season 1\\)\"), the series\nreceived accolades ranging from [Emmys](/wiki/Emmy_Award \"Emmy Award\") to\n[Teen Choice Awards](/wiki/Teen_Choice_Awards \"Teen Choice Awards\").\n_Smallville_ spawned a series of young-adult novels, a DC Comics bimonthly\ncomic book, soundtrack recordings and series-related merchandise. All ten\nseasons are available on DVD in [regions 1, 2 and 4](/wiki/DVD_region_code\n\"DVD region code\"). In April 2012, it continued in comic-book form with a\nstoryline resuming shortly after the [series\nfinale](/wiki/Finale_\\(Smallville\\) \"Finale \\(Smallville\\)\"), and ended in\nNovember 2014.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Series overview\n  * 2 Cast\n  * 3 Production\n    * 3.1 Development\n    * 3.2 Crew changes\n    * 3.3 Filming\n    * 3.4 Music\n  * 4 Broadcasting\n    * 4.1 Reception\n    * 4.2 Nielsen rankings\n    * 4.3 Accolades\n  * 5 Other media\n    * 5.1 Literature\n      * 5.1.1 Young adult novels\n      * 5.1.2 Comic books\n      * 5.1.3 _Smallville Season Eleven_\n        * 5.1.3.1 Main series\n        * 5.1.3.2 Interlude series\n    * 5.2 _Chloe Chronicles_\n    * 5.3 Promotional tie-ins\n    * 5.4 Spin-offs\n  * 6 Home video\n  * 7 Merchandise\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Series overview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Series overview\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Smallville episodes](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes\n\"List of Smallville episodes\")\n\nSeason | Episodes | Originally aired  \n---|---|---  \nFirst aired | Last aired | Network  \n| [1](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_1_.282001.E2.80.9302.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 21 | October 16, 2001 (2001-10-16) | May 21, 2002 (2002-05-21) | [The WB](/wiki/The_WB \"The WB\")  \n| [2](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_2_.282002.E2.80.9303.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 23 | September 24, 2002 (2002-09-24) | May 20, 2003 (2003-05-20)  \n| [3](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_3_.282003.E2.80.9304.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 22 | October 1, 2003 (2003-10-01) | May 19, 2004 (2004-05-19)  \n| [4](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_4_.282004.E2.80.9305.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 22 | September 22, 2004 (2004-09-22) | May 18, 2005 (2005-05-18)  \n| [5](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_5_.282005.E2.80.9306.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 22 | September 29, 2005 (2005-09-29) | May 11, 2006 (2006-05-11)  \n| [6](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_6_.282006.E2.80.9307.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 22 | September 28, 2006 (2006-09-28) | May 17, 2007 (2007-05-17) | [The CW](/wiki/The_CW \"The CW\")  \n| [7](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_7_.282007.E2.80.9308.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 20 | September 27, 2007 (2007-09-27) | May 15, 2008 (2008-05-15)  \n| [8](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_8_.282008.E2.80.9309.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 22 | September 18, 2008 (2008-09-18) | May 14, 2009 (2009-05-14)  \n| [9](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_9_.282009.E2.80.9310.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 21 | September 25, 2009 (2009-09-25) | May 14, 2010 (2010-05-14)  \n| [10](/wiki/List_of_Smallville_episodes#Season_10_.282010.E2.80.9311.29 \"List of Smallville episodes\") | 22 | September 24, 2010 (2010-09-24) | May 13, 2011 (2011-05-13)  \n  \nThe regular cast is introduced in [season one](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_1\\)\n\"Smallville \\(season 1\\)\"), with storylines involving a villain deriving power\nfrom [kryptonite](/wiki/Kryptonite_in_Smallville \"Kryptonite in Smallville\")\nexposure. The one-episode villains were a plot device developed by Gough and\nMillar.[3] _Smallville_ 's first season primarily dealt with [Clark\nKent](/wiki/Clark_Kent_\\(Smallville\\) \"Clark Kent \\(Smallville\\)\")'s coming to\nterms with his alien origin and the revelation that his arrival on Earth was\nconnected to the death of [Lana Lang](/wiki/Lana_Lang_\\(Smallville\\) \"Lana\nLang \\(Smallville\\)\")'s parents.[4] After the first season the series had\nfewer villain-of-the-week episodes, focusing instead on individual-character\nstory arcs and exploring Clark's origins.[5] Major storylines include Clark's\ndiscovery of his [Kryptonian](/wiki/Kryptonian \"Kryptonian\") heritage and [Lex\nLuthor](/wiki/Lex_Luthor \"Lex Luthor\")'s escalating conflict with his father,\nLionel.[6] The disembodied voice of Clark's father, [Jor-El](/wiki/Jor-El\n\"Jor-El\"), is introduced; he communicates to Clark through his spaceship,\nsetting the stage for plots involving his role in fulfilling Clark's earthly\ndestiny.[7] In a [fourth-season](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_4\\) \"Smallville\n\\(season 4\\)\") arc Clark, instructed by Jor-El, searches for three Kryptonian\nstones which contain the knowledge of the universe and form his [Fortress of\nSolitude](/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude \"Fortress of Solitude\").[8][9] Clark\nbattles [Brainiac](/wiki/Brainiac_\\(comics\\) \"Brainiac \\(comics\\)\") in his\nattempts to release the Kryptonian criminal [General Zod](/wiki/General_Zod\n\"General Zod\"),[10] and must capture (or destroy) other escaped [Phantom\nZone](/wiki/Phantom_Zone \"Phantom Zone\") criminals.[11] His cousin\n[Kara](/wiki/Supergirl_\\(Kara_Zor-El\\) \"Supergirl \\(Kara Zor-El\\)\")\narrives,[12] and Lex Luthor discovers Clark's secret.[13] The [eighth\nseason](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_8\\) \"Smallville \\(season 8\\)\") introduces\nDavis Bloome (_Smallville_ 's version of [Doomsday](/wiki/Doomsday_\\(comics\\)\n\"Doomsday \\(comics\\)\")), and Tess Mercer replaces the departing Lex Luthor.\n[Justin Hartley](/wiki/Justin_Hartley \"Justin Hartley\") becomes a series\nregular as [Oliver Queen (Green Arrow)](/wiki/Justice_League_\\(Smallville\\)\n\"Justice League \\(Smallville\\)\") after being a recurring guest in [season\nsix](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_6\\) \"Smallville \\(season 6\\)\").[14] In the\n[ninth season](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_9\\) \"Smallville \\(season 9\\)\") Major\nZod ([Callum Blue](/wiki/Callum_Blue \"Callum Blue\")) and other members of\nZod's military group are revived (without their Kryptonian powers) by Tess\nMercer,[15] and their efforts to regain their powers are the season's central\nconflict. The final season revolves around Clark's attempts to lose his doubts\nand fears and become the hero he is meant to be, while confronting his biggest\nchallenges: the coming of [Darkseid](/wiki/Darkseid \"Darkseid\") and the return\nof Lex Luthor.[16]\n\n## Cast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Cast\")]\n\nMain article: [Characters of Smallville](/wiki/Characters_of_Smallville\n\"Characters of Smallville\")\n\n[![Young, casually-dressed man looking\nleft](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Tom_Welling_Comic_Con_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-\nTom_Welling_Comic_Con_%28cropped%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tom_Welling_Comic_Con_\\(cropped\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tom_Welling_Comic_Con_\\(cropped\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nAlthough Welling initially refused to audition for the role of Clark Kent, he\nchanged his mind after reading the script for the pilot episode.\n\n  * [Tom Welling](/wiki/Tom_Welling \"Tom Welling\") plays [Clark Kent](/wiki/Clark_Kent_\\(Smallville\\) \"Clark Kent \\(Smallville\\)\"), a young man with [superhuman](/wiki/Superhuman \"Superhuman\") abilities who tries to find his place in life after discovering that he is an alien and uses his powers to help those in danger. Clark's season-one problems include his inability to share his secret and his desire for a normal life. After months of scouting, Welling was cast as Clark.[17] Although David Nutter had to convince his manager that the role would not hurt the actor's film career to persuade Welling to read the pilot script, after reading the script Welling agreed to audition.[3]\n  * [Kristin Kreuk](/wiki/Kristin_Kreuk \"Kristin Kreuk\") plays [Lana Lang](/wiki/Lana_Lang_\\(Smallville\\) \"Lana Lang \\(Smallville\\)\"), the girl next door. Grieving the loss of her parents, she has empathy for everyone and feels connected to Clark.[18] Kreuk was the first to be cast, after Nutter saw an audition tape the actress had sent.[3] Although she left the series after the seventh season,[19] she returned for five episodes in season eight as a guest star.[20]\n  * [Michael Rosenbaum](/wiki/Michael_Rosenbaum \"Michael Rosenbaum\") plays [Lex Luthor](/wiki/Lex_Luthor_\\(Smallville\\) \"Lex Luthor \\(Smallville\\)\"), a billionaire's son sent to Smallville to run the local fertilizer plant. After Clark saves his life, they become fast friends.[21] As the series progresses, Lex's friendship with Clark crumbles until they consider themselves enemies. The role was difficult to cast;[4] Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and, feeling that he did not take his first audition seriously enough, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where to be funny, charismatic or menacing.[22] His second audition went so well that he was hired.[4] Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons,[19][23] reprising his role for the [series finale](/wiki/Finale_\\(Smallville\\) \"Finale \\(Smallville\\)\").[24]\n  * [Allison Mack](/wiki/Allison_Mack \"Allison Mack\") plays [Chloe Sullivan](/wiki/Chloe_Sullivan \"Chloe Sullivan\"), one of Clark's best friends, who is in love with him (although her feelings are not reciprocated).[25] Editor of the school newspaper, her journalistic curiosity and desire to \"expose falsehoods\" and \"know the truth\"[26] create tension with her friends (especially when she investigates Clark's past).[27] After learning about _Smallville_ from casting director Dee Dee Bradley, Mack considered auditioning for Lana Lang but auditioned twice for Chloe Sullivan.[26] The character was created just for the series,[4] and was intended to have an \"[ethnic background](/wiki/Ethnic#United_States \"Ethnic\")\" before Mack was hired.[26] She has since appeared in the comic book.[28]\n  * [Sam Jones III](/wiki/Sam_Jones_III \"Sam Jones III\") plays [Pete Ross](/wiki/Characters_of_Smallville#Pete_Ross \"Characters of Smallville\"), another best friend of Clark's and the first person to whom Clark voluntarily tells his secret.[29] Although he is in love with Chloe,[30] he does not admit it because of the Clark-Lana-Chloe love triangle already in place.[31] Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three, but made a guest appearance in season seven. Jones was the last of the series regulars to be cast, with Gough and Millar seeing him four days before they began filming the pilot.[31] In the comics Ross is [Caucasian](/wiki/Caucasian_race \"Caucasian race\"), but the producers chose to cast Jones (who is African-American).[31]\n  * [Annette O'Toole](/wiki/Annette_O%27Toole \"Annette O'Toole\") plays [Martha Kent](/wiki/Characters_of_Smallville#Martha_Kent \"Characters of Smallville\"), Clark's adoptive mother. She and her husband, Jonathan, give Clark wise advice about coping with his increasing abilities. In season five Martha takes a [state-senate](/wiki/State_Senator \"State Senator\") seat,[32] and in season six she leaves the show.[33] Although [Cynthia Ettinger](/wiki/Cynthia_Ettinger \"Cynthia Ettinger\") was originally cast as Martha Kent, during filming everyone (including Ettinger) realized that she was not right for the part.[4] O'Toole was committed to the television series _[The Huntress](/wiki/The_Huntress_\\(TV_series\\) \"The Huntress \\(TV series\\)\")_ when Ettinger filmed the original pilot. Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent when _The Huntress_ was canceled, allowing O'Toole to join the cast.[34] The actress had played Lana Lang in _[Superman III](/wiki/Superman_III \"Superman III\")_.[35]\n  * [John Schneider](/wiki/John_Schneider_\\(screen_actor\\) \"John Schneider \\(screen actor\\)\") plays [Jonathan Kent](/wiki/Characters_of_Smallville#Jonathan_Kent \"Characters of Smallville\"), Clark's adoptive father, who goes to great lengths to protect his son's secret; according to Schneider, Jonathan is \"perfectly willing to go to jail, or worse, to protect his son.\"[36] Schneider was written out of the show in the series' 100th episode, with Jonathan dying of a heart attack on the night of his election victory.[37] Millar and Gough wanted a recognizable face for _Smallville_ ; they were happy to cast Schneider as Jonathan because he was known as [Bo Duke](/wiki/Bo_Duke \"Bo Duke\") from _[The Dukes of Hazzard](/wiki/The_Dukes_of_Hazzard \"The Dukes of Hazzard\")_ , which Gough saw as adding to the belief that Schneider could have grown up running a farm.[4]\n  * [Eric Johnson](/wiki/Eric_Johnson_\\(actor\\) \"Eric Johnson \\(actor\\)\") plays [Whitney Fordman](/wiki/Whitney_Fordman \"Whitney Fordman\"), Lana's boyfriend in season one, who becomes jealous of Clark and Lana's budding friendship and [hazes](/wiki/Hazing \"Hazing\") him.[21] He reconciles with Clark before joining the [Marines](/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps \"United States Marine Corps\") and [going to Afghanistan](/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_\\(2001%E2%80%93present\\) \"War in Afghanistan \\(2001–present\\)\").[38] Although Whitney was written out of the show in the first-season finale, he made [cameo appearances](/wiki/Cameo_appearance \"Cameo appearance\") in the season-two episode \"Visage\" (where it is disclosed that he was [killed in action](/wiki/Coalition_casualties_in_Afghanistan \"Coalition casualties in Afghanistan\")) and the season-four episode \"Façade\" (during a flashback to Clark's freshman year of high school). Johnson, who auditioned for Lex and Clark before he was cast as Whitney,[39] was pleased that the writers gave his character a hero's exit.[40]\n  * [John Glover](/wiki/John_Glover_\\(actor\\) \"John Glover \\(actor\\)\") plays [Lionel Luthor](/wiki/Lionel_Luthor \"Lionel Luthor\"), Lex's father. Lionel is responsible for the Kents' adoption of Clark without legal ramifications or questions about his origins.[27] Glover tried to make Lionel seem to try to \"toughen [Lex] up\", and saw the character as a rich, powerful businessman who was disappointed in his son.[41] Lionel was created for _Smallville_ to parallel [the Kents](/wiki/Characters_of_Smallville#Jonathan_Kent \"Characters of Smallville\") and as an \"experiment in extreme parenting.\"[4] A recurring first-season guest, Glover became a series regular from seasons two to seven until Lionel was murdered by Lex near the end of the seventh season.[42] Lionel returns in a parallel-universe version, also portrayed by Glover, during the final season in a recurring role.[43]\n  * [Jensen Ackles](/wiki/Jensen_Ackles \"Jensen Ackles\") plays [Jason Teague](/wiki/Jason_Teague_\\(Smallville\\) \"Jason Teague \\(Smallville\\)\"), Lana's [love interest](/wiki/Love_interest \"Love interest\"), in season four. He follows Lana to Smallville from Paris, taking a job as the school's assistant football coach,[44] but is fired when their relationship comes to light. By the end of the season, it is disclosed that he was working with his mother to track the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge.[45] Before he was cast as Jason, Ackles was second in line for the role of Clark Kent.[46] Although he received top billing for season four and was contracted for season five, he was written out of the show in the season-four finale because of his commitment to _[Supernatural](/wiki/Supernatural_\\(U.S._TV_series\\) \"Supernatural \\(U.S. TV series\\)\")_.[47]\n\n[![Smiling young woman with long, light-brown\nhair](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Ericadurance2.jpg/170px-\nEricadurance2.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ericadurance2.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ericadurance2.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nErica Durance was cast as Lois Lane days before fourth-season filming began,\nand her appearance was initially restricted by the film division of [Warner\nBros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") Studios.\n\n  * [Erica Durance](/wiki/Erica_Durance \"Erica Durance\") plays [Lois Lane](/wiki/Lois_Lane_\\(Smallville\\) \"Lois Lane \\(Smallville\\)\"), Chloe's cousin who comes to Smallville to investigate Chloe's supposed death[8] and stays with the Kents. Durance, a recurring guest in season four, became a series regular. The producers wanted to bring Lois Lane to the series, and Chloe's supposed death in the season-three finale provided the opportunity. Durance was cast three days before filming began; although she could initially appear in only four episodes, according to the film division of [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\"), after negotiations her character was cleared for more appearances.[48]\n  * [Aaron Ashmore](/wiki/Aaron_Ashmore \"Aaron Ashmore\") plays [Jimmy Olsen](/wiki/Jimmy_Olsen_\\(Smallville\\) \"Jimmy Olsen \\(Smallville\\)\"), Chloe's photographer boyfriend who works at the _Daily Planet_. Ashmore, a recurring guest in season six, became a regular cast member in season seven. He called his casting a welcome surprise: \"I auditioned for [the role] and I put myself on tape. I hadn't heard anything, and a couple of weeks later, all of the sudden (sic), I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really.\"[49] After three seasons on the series (two as a regular), Ashmore's character was killed off. Although Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen was murdered, he said his character was not the \"real\" Jimmy Olsen, his real name revealed to be Henry James Olsen. Jimmy's younger brother, who appears briefly in the season-eight finale, is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois.[50] Ashmore returns as the younger Jimmy in the series finale.\n  * [Laura Vandervoort](/wiki/Laura_Vandervoort \"Laura Vandervoort\") plays [Kara](/wiki/Kara_\\(Smallville\\) \"Kara \\(Smallville\\)\"), Clark's Kryptonian cousin.

She has Clark's abilities, including flight.[51] At the end of the seventh season, Kara was trapped in the [Phantom Zone](/wiki/Phantom_Zone \"Phantom Zone\"). Although Vandervoort did not return regularly for the eighth season,[52] she had guest appearances to wrap up her storyline in season eight's \"Bloodline\" and season ten's \"Supergirl\" and \"Prophecy\".[53]\n  * [Justin Hartley](/wiki/Justin_Hartley \"Justin Hartley\") plays [Oliver Queen (Green Arrow)](/wiki/Justice_League_\\(Smallville\\) \"Justice League \\(Smallville\\)\"), the CEO of Queen Industries and leader of a small group of superheroes. Hartley, a recurring guest in the sixth and seventh seasons, became a series regular in season eight[14] and was the producers' first choice to play Oliver Queen. He was designed to shake up Clark and Lois in season six and to give Clark an alternate view of how to fight crime.[54]\n  * [Samuel Witwer](/wiki/Samuel_Witwer \"Samuel Witwer\") plays [Davis Bloome](/wiki/Davis_Bloome \"Davis Bloome\") in season eight.

Davis would come to resemble his comic-book counterpart over the course of the season.[56] [Brian Peterson](/wiki/Brian_Wayne_Peterson \"Brian Wayne Peterson\") said that with Michael Rosenbaum's departure, the new executive producers were looking for a villain \"as great as Lex\" and Doomsday fit the bill.[57]\n  * [Cassidy Freeman](/wiki/Cassidy_Freeman \"Cassidy Freeman\") plays [Tess Mercer](/wiki/Tess_Mercer \"Tess Mercer\"), Lex's handpicked successor as LuthorCorp CEO in season eight.[55] Her name is an homage to two _Superman_ characters, [Eve Teschmacher](/wiki/Eve_Teschmacher \"Eve Teschmacher\") and [Mercy Graves](/wiki/Mercy_Graves \"Mercy Graves\").[58] Freeman described her character as \"fierce\", \"fun\", and \"intelligent\", with finding Lex her primary season-eight goal. Tess believes that Clark will be able to help her.[59] In the season-ten episode \"Abandoned\", it is disclosed that her birth name is [Lutessa Lena Luthor](/wiki/Lena_Luthor \"Lena Luthor\") and she is Lionel's illegitimate daughter.[60]\n  * [Callum Blue](/wiki/Callum_Blue \"Callum Blue\") plays [Zod](/wiki/Characters_of_Smallville#Zod \"Characters of Smallville\"), an early version of the criminal from Krypton who was sent to the Phantom Zone prison. His character is first mentioned in season five, when [Brainiac](/wiki/Brainiac_\\(Smallville\\) \"Brainiac \\(Smallville\\)\") uses Lex's body as a vessel for Zod's spirit, and he appears in a Kryptonian sphere in the season-eight finale.[61] _Smallville_ 's executive producers called this incarnation \"Major Zod\" (as opposed to the typical \"General Zod\"), and in season nine \"the venomous side of Zod rises because he experiences a few key betrayals with our beloved characters\".[62]\n\n## Production[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Production\")]\n\n### Development[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\n[Tollin/Robbins Productions](/wiki/Tollin/Robbins_Productions \"Tollin/Robbins\nProductions\") originally wanted to do a series about a young Bruce Wayne, but\nthe feature-film division of Warner Bros. decided to develop an [origin\nmovie](/wiki/Batman_Begins \"Batman Begins\") for [Batman](/wiki/Batman\n\"Batman\") and did not want to compete with a television series.[4] In 2000\nTollin/Robbins approached Peter Roth, president of [Warner Bros.\nTelevision](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television \"Warner Bros. Television\"), about\ndeveloping a series on a young Superman. That year, [Alfred\nGough](/wiki/Alfred_Gough \"Alfred Gough\") and [Miles\nMillar](/wiki/Miles_Millar \"Miles Millar\") developed a pilot based on the film\n_[Eraser](/wiki/Eraser_\\(film\\) \"Eraser \\(film\\)\")_. After watching the pilot,\nRoth approached Gough and Millar about developing a pilot about a young\nSuperman;[4] the two made a \"no tights, no flights\" rule that Clark would not\nfly or wear the Superman suit during the series.[63]\n\n[![Young, blonde woman with arms folded at a\ntable](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Allison_Mack_at_ComicCon_2009_NN.jpg/170px-\nAllison_Mack_at_ComicCon_2009_NN.jpg)](/wiki/File:Allison_Mack_at_ComicCon_2009_NN.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Allison_Mack_at_ComicCon_2009_NN.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nChloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) was created for the series.\n\nGough and Millar wanted to strip Superman to his \"bare essence\", exploring why\nClark Kent became the Man of Steel.[4] They felt that because they were not\ncomic-book fans or familiar with the universe, they would have an unbiased\napproach to the series. Gough and Millar learned about the characters,\nresearching the comics and choosing what they liked.[4] They pitched their\nidea to The WB and [Fox](/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company \"Fox Broadcasting\nCompany\") on the same day.[64] A bidding war between the networks followed,\nwith The WB committing to thirteen episodes.[64]\n\nAlthough Roth, Gough and Millar knew the show would be action-oriented, they\nwanted to reach _[7th Heaven](/wiki/7th_Heaven_\\(TV_series\\) \"7th Heaven \\(TV\nseries\\)\")_ 's \"middle America iconography\". To create atmosphere, the team\ndecided the [meteor shower](/wiki/Meteor_shower \"Meteor shower\") bringing\nClark to Earth would be the ironic foundation of the show. The primary source\nof his life on Earth and the super-powered beings Clark must fight, it would\ntake away the parents of the girl he loves and start Lex Luthor down a dark\npath. Roth appreciated Clark's conflict in dealing with the fact that his\narrival caused so much pain.[4]\n\nThe creators also had to address why Lex Luthor would socialize with young\npeople. They created a loneliness in the character which they felt would drive\nhim to reach out to the teenagers,[4] a loneliness echoed in Clark and\nLana.[3] Gough and Millar wanted a parallel to the Kents and created Lionel\nLuthor, Lex's father, whom they saw as conducting an \"experiment in extreme\nparenting.\"[4] They wanted a younger Kent couple, to be involved in Clark's\nlife and help him on his journey.[3] [Chloe Sullivan](/wiki/Chloe_Sullivan\n\"Chloe Sullivan\") (another character created for the series) was considered\nthe \"outsider\" the show needed to ensure that someone would notice the strange\nhappenings in Smallville[4] rather than a \"precursor to [Lois\nLane](/wiki/Lois_Lane \"Lois Lane\")\".[3]\n\n_Smallville_ has been described by Warner Bros. as a from-the-roots\nreinterpretation of Superman mythology. Since the November 2004 reacquisition\nof [Superboy](/wiki/Superboy \"Superboy\") by [the Siegel\nfamily](/wiki/Jerry_Siegel \"Jerry Siegel\"), a [copyright\ninfringement](/wiki/Copyright_infringement \"Copyright infringement\") dispute\nhas arisen over [ownership of the fictional town of\nSmallville](/wiki/Superman#Copyright_battles \"Superman\") and a claimed\nsimilarity between Superboy and _Smallville_ 's Clark Kent.

The developers thanked the cast\nand crew for their work, acknowledging that they never stopped fighting for\nwhat they saw as \"their vision\" of the show. A reason for their departure was\nnot provided.[66] Gough and Millar were replaced as\n[showrunners](/wiki/Showrunner \"Showrunner\") by [Todd\nSlavkin](/wiki/Todd_Slavkin \"Todd Slavkin\"), [Darren\nSwimmer](/wiki/Darren_Swimmer \"Darren Swimmer\"), Kelly Souders and Brian\nPeterson. All began writing for the series at the start of the second season,\nand were executive producers by the seventh season. On February 6, 2009, after\none season, the _L.A. Times_ confirmed that Swimmer and Slavkin would take\nover the new CW series _[Melrose Place](/wiki/Melrose_Place_\\(2009_TV_series\\)\n\"Melrose Place \\(2009 TV series\\)\")_ and not return for _Smallville_ 's ninth\nseason; Souders and Peterson would continue as showrunners.[67] On July 24,\n2009, it was reported Tom Welling was a co-executive producer of the\nseries.[68] On March 26, 2010, _[The Hollywood\nReporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_ disclosed\nthat Millar, Gough and co-producer Tollin/Robins Productions filed a lawsuit\nagainst Warner Bros. and The CW charging that Hollywood's \"[vertical\nintegration](/wiki/Vertical_integration \"Vertical integration\")\" cost Millar\nand Gough millions of dollars. The suit claimed that Warner Bros. failed to\n\"maximize profits\" in marketing _Smallville_ , misrepresented production costs\nand sold the show to foreign markets at \"well below the value of the series\",\nnot specifying the amount of compensation sought by the plaintiffs.[69] In a\nMay 20, 2010 press release from [The CW](/wiki/The_CW \"The CW\"), Tom Welling\nwas appointed an executive producer for _Smallville_ 's tenth season.[70]\n\n### Filming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Filming\")]\n\nThe series was produced at BB Studios in [Burnaby](/wiki/Burnaby \"Burnaby\"),\nBritish Columbia. Although production was initially planned for Australia,\n[Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver \"Vancouver\") had more of a \"Middle America\nlandscape\". The city provided a site for the Kent farm, doubled for\nMetropolis, provided a cheaper shooting location and was in the Los Angeles\ntime zone.[4] Smallville's Main Street is a combination of two locations in\nthe town of [Merritt](/wiki/Merritt,_British_Columbia \"Merritt, British\nColumbia\") and [Cloverdale](/wiki/Cloverdale,_British_Columbia \"Cloverdale,\nBritish Columbia\").[3]\n\n[![A white billboard with a blue ribbon around the edges.

The students\nbecame accustomed to the film crew (which had to shoot when school was in\nsession), and when a class was dismissed the crew stepped aside so the\nstudents could move the equipment to get to their lockers for the next\nclass.[72]\n\nThe Kent farm is a working farm in\n[Aldergrove](/wiki/Aldergrove,_British_Columbia \"Aldergrove, British\nColumbia\"). Owned by the Anderlinis, the crew painted their home yellow for\nthe show.[64] Exterior shots of Luthor Mansion were filmed at [Hatley\nCastle](/wiki/Hatley_Castle \"Hatley Castle\") in\n[Victoria](/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia \"Victoria, British Columbia\").[3]\nThe interiors were filmed at Shannon Mews in Vancouver, also the set for the\n_[Dark Angel](/wiki/Dark_Angel_\\(TV_series\\) \"Dark Angel \\(TV series\\)\")_\npilot and the film _[Along Came a Spider](/wiki/Along_Came_a_Spider_\\(film\\)\n\"Along Came a Spider \\(film\\)\")_.[3] Clova Cinema, in Cloverdale was used for\nexteriors of the Talon, _Smallville_ 's coffeehouse.[73]\n\nThe story is told from Clark's point of view, so color schemes and camera\nselection illustrate how he interprets his environment. When he is safe at\nhome, the colors are \"warm and gentle\" earth tones and the camera movement is\n\"very gentle\". When Clark is keeping his secret and not in danger, the\nlighting is more neutral and the camera more mobile. When danger is present,\nthe lighting becomes colder and the camera is [handheld](/wiki/Hand-\nheld_camera \"Hand-held camera\") to allow for more \"extreme angles\". In\nMetropolis \"clean, hard-lined architecture\" predominates, with blues, purples\nand reflective metals the dominant scheme. The same concept is used for the\ncharacters; Lex usually has a \"glass, steel background\", and Lionel has a\nwhite or \"clinical blue\" background. Lex typically wears black, grey and \"cool\ntones\" (purples and blues). Clark is represented by red, yellow and blue,\nsimilar to the traditional Superman costume, and \"All-American\" red, white and\nblue.[74] From season two onward, [Entity FX](/wiki/Entity_FX \"Entity FX\")\nproduced all of the visual effects for _Smallville_ , including the view of\nthe Metropolis skyline.[75]\n\n### Music[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Music\")]\n\nComposer [Mark Snow](/wiki/Mark_Snow \"Mark Snow\") worked with producer Ken\nHorton to create _Smallville_ 's score. Snow composed music as he watched the\npicture, and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings.\nHe then sent the music to the producers, who sent it back for recomposition if\nneeded. Individual episodes have their own soundtrack, comprising one (or\nmore) songs. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for\nsongs for the soundtrack. Their choices were discussed by the producers, who\ndecided which songs they wanted and secured their rights. Although Snow said\nit initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a \"typical action-\nadventure\" television show, \"the producers seem to like the contrast of the\nmodern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score\".[76]\n\nI get a locked picture on a videotape which syncs up with all my gear in the\nstudio. I write the music, finish it up, mix it up, send it through the\nairwaves on the internet, and the music editor puts it in. They call up\nusually and say, 'Thank you, well done.' Sometimes they call and say, \"Thank\nyou, not so well done—can you change this or that?\" I say \"Sure,\" make the\nchanges and send it back.[76]\n\n—Mark Snow, on composing music for each episode\n\nThe main _Smallville_ theme was not composed by Snow, although he composed\nopening themes for other shows (including _[The X-Files](/wiki/The_X-Files\n\"The X-Files\")_). The series' opening music is \"[Save\nMe](/wiki/Save_Me_\\(Remy_Zero_song\\) \"Save Me \\(Remy Zero song\\)\")\" by [Remy\nZero](/wiki/Remy_Zero \"Remy Zero\"). Snow composed the closing-credits music,\nwhich was intended as _Smallville_ 's theme. During the first two seasons, the\nclosing-credits music was a potential theme for the series (before \"Save Me\"\nwas selected); it was more \"heroic\" and \"in-your-face\". Snow was told during\nseason two that the closing credits needed new music, since the show had\nevolved and the existing music was no longer suitable, and he created a new,\ntoned-down score with a more \"melodic\" sound.[72] Snow has also reworked music\nfrom the previous [_Superman_ films](/wiki/Superman_in_film \"Superman in\nfilm\"). [John Williams](/wiki/John_Williams \"John Williams\")' musical score\nfor the Krypton sequence in the opening credits of\n_[Superman](/wiki/Superman_\\(1978_film\\) \"Superman \\(1978 film\\)\")_ was used\nin season two's \"Rosetta\" (which featured a guest appearance by [Christopher\nReeve](/wiki/Christopher_Reeve \"Christopher Reeve\")) and several times in the\nseason-two finale. To save money Snow recorded his version of Williams' score,\nsince using the original version would have required the team to pay Williams'\norchestra.[77]\n\nIn an interview with Randall Larson on May 23, 2008 Snow said that he would\nnot be returning to _Smallville_ , citing the joint workload of _Smallville_\nand _[Ghost Whisperer](/wiki/Ghost_Whisperer \"Ghost Whisperer\")_ , but would\nreturn for _Ghost Whisperer_. Reminiscing about his work on the show, Snow\nsaid that much of the music had not changed during the series and agreed with\nLarson that it was \"more [about] maintaining the heroic concept and the\nmythology than progressing through specific changes\".[78] Louis Febre, who\nworked closely with Snow from the beginning, became the sole composer for\n_Smallville_ in season seven. Febre said that since he began composing for\n_Smallville_ there was a shift to \"thematic development\" in the score,\nparalleling the characters' growth: \"As Clark grew emotionally and\nintellectually more complex, I found a need to comment musically on his\ngrowth, and as he drew closer to his Superman persona, it became obvious that\na 'Superman' theme would be required.\"[79]\n\nThe creative team had a number of opportunities to try different music to\nenhance an episode's storyline. Pyken and Wade-Reed chose and coordinated\nmusic on the show when Snow and Febre's scores were not used.[80] In season\nthree's \"Slumber\", producer Ken Horton wondered if they could get a band to\nprovide music for the entire episode. During a breakfast meeting with the\nmusic department of Warner Bros. [R.E.M.](/wiki/R.E.M. \"R.E.M.\") was\nsuggested, and Pyken and Wade-Reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect\nthe episode's featured band with its story (which revolved around [REM\nsleep](/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_\\(sleep\\) \"Rapid eye movement\n\\(sleep\\)\")).[81] That season, Al Gough wanted to use [Johnny\nCash](/wiki/Johnny_Cash \"Johnny Cash\")'s cover of the [Nine Inch\nNails](/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails \"Nine Inch Nails\") song\n\"[Hurt](/wiki/Hurt_\\(Nine_Inch_Nails_song\\) \"Hurt \\(Nine Inch Nails song\\)\")\"\nfor the final scene of \"Shattered\" (when Lionel Luthor looks at Lex through a\none-way mirror at [Belle Reve](/wiki/Belle_Reve \"Belle Reve\") sanitarium) as\nsoon as he read the episode's script. Cash died while Wade-Reed was trying to\nobtain the rights for the song and his heirs, believing that the song's use in\nthe episode would honor his memory, gave _Smallville_ the rights.[82]\n\nFor season three's \"Resurrection\" and \"Memoria\", songs were chosen as\nsymbolism for the characters. In \"Resurrection\", [The\nRapture](/wiki/The_Rapture_\\(band\\) \"The Rapture \\(band\\)\")'s\n\"[Infatuation](/wiki/Echoes_\\(The_Rapture_album\\) \"Echoes \\(The Rapture\nalbum\\)\")\" was used during a scene with Lex and Lana to symbolize the\nquestion, \"Are we ever going to figure out what these two people think of each\nother?\"[83] For \"Memoria\" Gough wanted to use [Evanescence](/wiki/Evanescence\n\"Evanescence\")'s \"[My Immortal](/wiki/My_Immortal \"My Immortal\")\" for the\nepisode's final scene, telling Wade-Reed that he saw the song as being about\nmothers. In that scene Clark tells Martha that his first childhood memory was\nof his mother, [Lara](/wiki/Lara_\\(comics\\) \"Lara \\(comics\\)\").[84]\n\nSeason three's \"Velocity\" provided the music editors with the opportunity to\nuse [hip-hop](/wiki/Hip_hop_music \"Hip hop music\"), rarely used in the series.\nThe episode, similar to _[The Fast and the\nFurious](/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious_\\(2001_film\\) \"The Fast and the\nFurious \\(2001 film\\)\")_ , focused on Pete. Wade-Reed heard of British hip-hop\nartist [Dizzee Rascal](/wiki/Dizzee_Rascal \"Dizzee Rascal\"), and was the first\nperson in the United States to secure the rights to Rascal's album.[85] Greg\nBeeman directs episodes, and sometimes scenes, with particular songs in mind.\nFor \"Vortex\" in season two, he used [Coldplay](/wiki/Coldplay \"Coldplay\")'s\n\"[In My Place](/wiki/In_My_Place \"In My Place\")\" for the final scene.[86] In\nthe season-two finale \"Exodus\", Beeman directed the scene where Lana shows up\nat the Kent barn before Lex's wedding to [Matthew Good](/wiki/Matthew_Good\n\"Matthew Good\")'s \"Weapon\". The lyrics speak of an angel and devil \"by my\nside\", and Beeman timed specific shots to the song's lyrics.[77]\n\n## Broadcasting[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Broadcasting\")]\n\n_Smallville_ premiered at 9:00 pm on Tuesday,[87] October 16, 2001 on The\nWB.[88] For the next five seasons the series aired on The WB, moving from\nTuesday at 9:00 pm to Wednesday at 8:00 pm and eventually to Thursday at 8:00\npm. In 2006, before the start of _Smallville_ 's sixth season, it was\nannounced The WB and [UPN](/wiki/UPN \"UPN\") would merge into [The\nCW](/wiki/The_CW \"The CW\") and the network reported that the series would\ncontinue in its lineup.[89] During its seventh season, the series aired in\nCanada a day earlier than it did in the United States.[90] On May 21, 2009 it\nwas announced that _Smallville_ 's ninth season would move to Friday at 8:00\npm, considered the \"[death slot](/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot \"Friday night\ndeath slot\")\" for television programs.[91][92] By the end of its tenth season\nit was the longest-running [science-fiction TV\nshow](/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television \"Science fiction on television\") in\nthe United States, breaking the record held by _[Stargate\nSG-1](/wiki/Stargate_SG-1 \"Stargate SG-1\")_.[93] Syndication rights became\navailable in 2011, and [TNT](/wiki/TNT_\\(TV_channel\\) \"TNT \\(TV channel\\)\")\nbegan airing episodes on October 3, 2011.[94] _Smallville_ began streaming on\n[Hulu](/wiki/Hulu \"Hulu\") on October 1, 2016.[95]\n\n### Reception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Reception\")]\n\n_Smallville_ set a WB record as its highest-rated series debut, with 8.4\nmillion viewers tuned in for the pilot.[96] Its premiere set a WB record for\nadults aged 18–34 and finished first among viewers aged 12–34, with Warner\nBros. president Jordan Levin crediting the series with invigorating the\nnetwork's Tuesday-night lineup. _Smallville_ appeared on the cover of\n_[Entertainment Weekly](/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly \"Entertainment Weekly\")_ as\none of five new shows to watch.[97] After its first season, the series was\nsixth on the [Parents Television Council](/wiki/Parents_Television_Council\n\"Parents Television Council\")'s 10-best list of broadcast programs.[98] Levin,\nacknowledging early concerns that _Smallville_ had become a [villain of the\nweek](/wiki/Villain_of_the_week \"Villain of the week\") series, said that\nseason two would introduce \"smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes\" and\nbecome less of a \"serialized show\".[99] According to Gough, although each\nsucceeding season relied more on season-long story arcs, an occasional\nvillain-of-the-week story was necessary. The villain-of-the-week stories were\nmore harshly criticized by fans of the Superman mythology, but Gough wanted to\nplease them and The WB's general audience (teenagers who preferred villain-of-\nthe-week stories over episodes focusing on the Superman mythology).[100]\n\n[Christopher Reeve](/wiki/Christopher_Reeve \"Christopher Reeve\"), star of the\n[_Superman_ films](/wiki/Superman_in_film \"Superman in film\"), expressed his\napproval of the show:\n\n> I was a little bit skeptical when I heard about [_Smallville_] at first, but\n> I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite\n> remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to\n> film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and\n> effects technology today on a weekly TV show.

However, Heitmueller wrote that the series would have a\ndifficult time addressing why no one in Smallville (including Lex Luthor)\nrecognized Clark when he put on the suit.[102] TV Guide's Michael Schneider\ncalled it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for\ntelevision,[103] but Christopher Hooton of\n_[Metro](/wiki/Metro_\\(British_newspaper\\) \"Metro \\(British newspaper\\)\")_\nwrote that _Smallville_ was a story which did not need to be told: \"No-one\nbothered to follow Bruce Wayne's tedious years spent manufacturing microchips\nbefore he became Batman, so why must we endure a decade of flannel shirt-\nwearing Clark Kent bucking hay?\"[104]\n\n### Nielsen\nrankings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Nielsen rankings\")]\n\nA table of season rankings, based on average total estimated viewers per\nepisode, of _Smallville_ on The WB and The CW follows. \"Rank\" is the series'\nratings compared to other [prime time](/wiki/Prime_time \"Prime time\") TV\nseries.\n\nSeason | Timeslot ([ET](/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone_\\(North_America\\) \"Eastern Time Zone \\(North America\\)\")/[PT](/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone \"Pacific Time Zone\")) | Network | Premiered | Ended | Rank | Viewers  \n(in millions)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nDate | Premiere  \nViewers  \n(in millions) | Date | Finale  \nviewers  \n(in millions)  \n[1](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_1\\) \"Smallville \\(season 1\\)\") ([2001–02](/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2001–02 United States network television schedule\")) | Tuesday 9/8C | [The WB](/wiki/The_WB_Television_Network \"The WB Television Network\") | October 16, 2001 | 8.40[105] | May 21, 2002 | 6.00[106] | 115[107] | 5.90[107]  \n[2](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_2\\) \"Smallville \\(season 2\\)\") ([2002–03](/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2002–03 United States network television schedule\")) | September 24, 2002 | 8.70[108] | May 20, 2003 | 7.50[109] | 113[110] | 6.30[110]  \n[3](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_3\\) \"Smallville \\(season 3\\)\") ([2003–04](/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2003–04 United States network television schedule\")) | Wednesday 8/7C | October 1, 2003 | 6.80[111] | May 19, 2004 | 5.92[112] | 141[113] | 4.96[113]  \n[4](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_4\\) \"Smallville \\(season 4\\)\") ([2004–05](/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2004–05 United States network television schedule\")) | September 22, 2004 | 6.07[114] | May 18, 2005 | 5.47[115] | 124[116] | 4.40[116]  \n[5](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_5\\) \"Smallville \\(season 5\\)\") ([2005–06](/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2005–06 United States network television schedule\")) | Thursday 8/7C | September 29, 2005 | 5.90[117] | May 11, 2006 | 4.85[118] | 117[119] | 4.70[119]  \n[6](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_6\\) \"Smallville \\(season 6\\)\") ([2006–07](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2006–07 United States network television schedule\")) | [The CW](/wiki/The_CW_Television_Network \"The CW Television Network\") | September 28, 2006 | 4.96[120] | May 17, 2007 | 4.14[121] | 125[122] | 4.10[122]  \n[7](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_7\\) \"Smallville \\(season 7\\)\") ([2007–08](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2007–08 United States network television schedule\")) | September 27, 2007 | 5.18[123] | May 15, 2008 | 3.85[124] | 175[125] | 3.77[125]  \n[8](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_8\\) \"Smallville \\(season 8\\)\") ([2008–09](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2008–09 United States network television schedule\")) | September 18, 2008 | 4.34[126] | May 14, 2009 | 3.13[127] | 152[128] | 3.74[128]  \n[9](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_9\\) \"Smallville \\(season 9\\)\") ([2009–10](/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2009–10 United States network television schedule\")) | Friday 8/7C | September 25, 2009[129] | 2.58[130] | May 14, 2010 | 2.45[131] | 129[132] | 2.38[132]  \n[10](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_10\\) \"Smallville \\(season 10\\)\") ([2010–11](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_United_States_network_television_schedule \"2010–11 United States network television schedule\")) | September 24, 2010[133] | 2.98[134] | May 13, 2011[135] | 3.02[136] | 131[137] | 3.19[138]  \n  \n### Accolades[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Accolades\")]\n\nDuring its ten seasons, _Smallville_ won awards ranging from\n[Emmys](/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award \"Primetime Emmy Award\") to [Teen Choice\nAwards](/wiki/Teen_Choice_Awards \"Teen Choice Awards\").

A bimonthly\ncomic-book series, which often tied into the series, was also published.\n\n#### Young adult\nnovels[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Young adult novels\")]\n\nThree novels were published on October 1, 2002: one by Aspect and two by\nLittle, Brown Young Readers. The Aspect novel (_Smallville: Strange Visitors_)\nwas written by [Roger Stern](/wiki/Roger_Stern \"Roger Stern\"), with Clark and\nhis friends trying to uncover the truth about two religious con men who set up\nshop in Smallville and use kryptonite in their spiritual seminars to rob the\ntownspeople.[157] Little, Brown Young Readers first published _Arrival_ by\nMichael Teitelbaum, chronicling the [series' pilot](/wiki/Pilot_\\(Smallville\\)\n\"Pilot \\(Smallville\\)\").[158] The second novel (_See No Evil_ , by series\nwriters [Cherie Bennett](/wiki/Cherie_Bennett \"Cherie Bennett\") and [Jeff\nGottesfeld](/wiki/Jeff_Gottesfeld \"Jeff Gottesfeld\")) follows Dawn Mills, a\nyoung actress who wants to attend [Juilliard](/wiki/Juilliard \"Juilliard\").\nDawn, who can become invisible, wants to get revenge on the people who have\nbeen talking behind her back but is stopped by Clark.[159] _See No Evil_ was\none of the original storylines for season one's \"Shimmer\".[160]\n\nOn November 1, 2002 Aspect published [Alan\nGrant's](/wiki/Alan_Grant_\\(writer\\) \"Alan Grant \\(writer\\)\") _Smallville:\nDragon_ , about an ex-convict who assumes the abilities and appearance of a\ndragon after he is exposed to kryptonite in a cave; the mutation drives him to\ntry to kill everyone who testified against him. In the novel, Clark is\nhypnotized into believing that he is a normal teenager with no special\nabilities.[161] A month after the publication of Grant's novel Bennett and\nGottesfeld wrote Little, Brown Young Readers' _Flight_ , about a young girl\n(Tia) who Clark discovers has wings. He and his friends believe that Tia is\nbeing abused by her father, and teach her to overcome her fear of flying so\nshe can find her mother.[162] _Flight_ (like _See No Evil_) was a planned\nepisode, but the crew was uncertain that they could get the flying effects\nright and the idea was scrapped.[163] Nancy Holder wrote the third novel in\nthe Aspect series. Published on January 1, 2003, _Hauntings_ follows Clark and\nhis friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in a Smallville house.[164]\nLittle, Brown Young Readers then published _Animal Rage_ by David and Bobby\nWeiss, about animal-rights activist Heather Fox (who can change into any\nanimal she touches). Heather uses this ability to harm people who hurt animals\nuntil Clark discovers it and stops her.[165] Aspect published [Dean Wesley\nSmith](/wiki/Dean_Wesley_Smith \"Dean Wesley Smith\")'s _Whodunit_ , in which\nClark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigate the murder of a boy and his sister\nwhile Lex tries to decide whether to ransom his kidnapped father or try\nrescuing Lionel himself.[166]\n\nLittle, Brown Young Readers published the next two books in April and June\n2003. The first, _Speed_ , was written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld.\nThe second, _Buried Secrets_ , was written by Suzan Colon. In _Speed_ , a boy\nuses an hourglass his father gave him for his birthday to stop time and commit\n[hate crimes](/wiki/Hate_crime \"Hate crime\") without being caught. Clark stops\nhim before he disrupts a local multicultural festival.[167] In _Buried\nSecrets_ Clark and Lex fall in love with a mind-reading substitute Spanish\nteacher, jeopardizing their friendship.[168]\n\nOn September 9, 2004 Aspect published [Diana G.\nGallagher](/wiki/Diana_G._Gallagher \"Diana G. Gallagher\")'s _Shadows_ , about\na girl and her father who move to Smallville; the father creates murderous\nmonsters. Jonathan Kent assumes that the deaths are related to LuthorCorp,\ncreating tension with his son. Clark discovers the truth to prove Lex's\ninnocence, stopping the creatures before they can kill again.[169] Colon\nreturned to write _Runaway_ , in which Clark runs away to the city and lives\nwith other homeless teenagers; he falls in love with one of the girls before\nreturning home.[170] In _Smallville: Silence_ by Nancy Holder, the characters\ninvestigate zombies in town.[171] Little, Brown Young Readers published its\neighth book, _Greed_ , by Bennett and Gottesfeld in which Clark and his\nfriends take summer jobs as counselors at a camp for disadvantaged youths.\nWhen a boy falls into Crater Lake, he develops the ability to foretell the\nfuture and Lionel tries to exploit this. Pete also tries to exploit Clark's\nabilities by tricking him into playing in a basketball game and betting on the\noutcome.[172]\n\nAlan Grant returned to write _Curse_ , about a gravedigger who unleashes a\n150-year-old curse onto Smallville and Clark's attempts to put things\nright.[173] On February 1, 2004 Little, Brown Young Readers published Suzan\nColon's _Temptation_ , where Clark uses red kryptonite in an attempt to\nimpress Lana and Chloe when they are infatuated with a French exchange\nstudent.[174] Aspect published its final novel on March 1, 2004. Written by\n[Devin K. Grayson](/wiki/Devin_K._Grayson \"Devin K. Grayson\"), _City_ follows\nClark and Lex on a trip to Metropolis. In the city, they are caught between\nthe [Japanese mafia](/wiki/Yakuza \"Yakuza\") and a secret agent who thinks he\nhas found an alien.[175] In Little, Brown Young Readers' final novel, \"Sparks\"\nby Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld, Chloe is hit by kryptonite sparks from\na fireworks display. The sparks make Chloe the desire of every man, but when\nthey wear off an admirer kidnaps her and she is rescued by Clark.[176]\n\n#### Comic books[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Comic books\")]\n\n_Smallville_ 's first venture into comics was \"Elemental\", a one-off story by\nGough and Millar which appeared in _[TV Guide](/wiki/TV_Guide \"TV Guide\")_\nduring the series' first season and set in that period.[177] Before the start\nof season two, [DC Comics](/wiki/DC_Comics \"DC Comics\") published a one-off\ncomic based on the series. Entitled _Smallville: The Comic_ , it has two\nstories. The first, \"Raptor\" by [Mark Verheiden](/wiki/Mark_Verheiden \"Mark\nVerheiden\") and Roy Martinez, is about an abused boy who mutates into a\n[raptor](/wiki/Velociraptor \"Velociraptor\") (thanks to kryptonite) and tries\nto get revenge on the Luthor family. [Michael\nGreen](/wiki/Michael_Green_\\(writer\\) \"Michael Green \\(writer\\)\") and [John\nPaul Leon](/wiki/John_Paul_Leon \"John Paul Leon\") wrote \"Exile and The\nKingdom\", with insight into why Lex remains in Smallville after his father\noffers him a position in Metropolis at the end of season one.[178] DC Comics\nthen began publishing a bimonthly comic with stories about _Smallville_\ncharacters. Writer and script coordinator Clint Carpenter called the comic-\nbook line a companion to the series rather than a non-canonical version.\nAccording to Carpenter, the comic-book line expands on events in the series\n(such as season-ending cliffhangers) and gives \"additional depth\" to\ncharacters with limited screen time on the series or whose storylines needed\nadditional explanation.[179]\n\nCarpenter was not the first person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden,\nwho co-wrote the one-off comic, was originally intended to be in charge of the\nbimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from\nworking on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on.\nAlthough the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there\nwas an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production\nschedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book\nshowed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing\nmultiple ATMs.[179] The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the _Chloe\nChronicles_ webisodes[180] and _Smallville_ -related webpages,[179] with cast\nand crew interviews and information on the episodes' production.[178][181] The\ncomic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the\nSeason Eleven series debut.\n\n# | Title | Publisher | Year | ISBN | Reprints  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**1** | _**Smallville**_ | [DC Comics](/wiki/DC_Comics \"DC Comics\") | 2004 | [ISBN](/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number_\\(identifier\\) \"International Standard Book Number \\(identifier\\)\") [9781401202040](/wiki/Special:BookSources/9781401202040 \"Special:BookSources/9781401202040\") |  Collects [show] The reprinted material is, in whole or in part, from:  \n\n  * _Smallville: The Comics_ #1 (November 2002) and _Smallville #1–4_ (March – November 2003)\n\n  \nCredits and full notes [show] | Writer(s) | \n\n  * Clint Carpenter\n  * [Michael Green](/wiki/Michael_Green_\\(writer\\) \"Michael Green \\(writer\\)\")\n  * [Mark Verheiden](/wiki/Mark_Verheiden \"Mark Verheiden\")\n\n  \n---|---  \nPenciller(s) | \n\n  * Thomas Denrenick\n  * Tom Derenick\n  * Renato Guedes\n  * [John Paul Leon](/wiki/John_Paul_Leon \"John Paul Leon\")\n  * Kilian Plunkett\n  * John Van Fleet\n\n  \n  \n**Note:** The full title of all volumes listed here start with \"_Smallville:_\n\".\n\n  \n\n#### _Smallville Season\nEleven_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: Smallville Season Eleven\")]\n\nThe first digital issue of a _Smallville Season Eleven_ comic book was\nreleased on April 13, 2012; the first print issue was published on May 2,\n2012.[182] In the comic book (written by _Smallville_ executive story editor\n[Bryan Q.

Two\nvolumes of _Chloe Chronicles_ totaled eleven mini-episodes. In the first\nvolume Chloe investigated events leading to the death of Earl Jenkins, who\nheld Chloe and her friends hostage at the LuthorCorp plant in the first-season\nepisode \"[Jitters](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_1\\)#ep8 \"Smallville \\(season\n1\\)\")\". It aired from April 29 to May 20, 2003 to AOL subscribers.[189] After\nthe first volume received positive responses from viewers, the second volume\nwas created as a continuation with Sam Jones III as Pete Ross. This volume\nused the _Smallville_ comic books as a secondary tie-in to the series. Viewers\ncould watch _Smallville_ , _Chloe 's Chronicles_ and finish with the\n_Smallville_ comic book, which would provide an \"enhanced backstory to the\nonline segments\".[190] The later series, _Vengeance Chronicles_ , is a spinoff\nof the fifth-season episode \"[Vengeance](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_5\\)#ep101\n\"Smallville \\(season 5\\)\")\". In this series Chloe joins a costumed vigilante,\nwhom she calls the \"[Angel of Vengeance](/wiki/Acrata#In_other_media\n\"Acrata\")\", to expose Lex Luthor's Level 33.1 experiments on meteor-infected\npeople.[191]\n\nThe idea for an online show about Chloe originated with Mark Warshaw, who ran\nthe show's website and was in charge of the DVDs. The series intended to wrap\nup \"unfinished business\" from the television show.[192] Although _Smallville:\nChloe Chronicles_ began on AOL, it made its way to the United Kingdom's\nChannel 4 website.[192] According to Lisa Gregorian, senior vice president for\ntelevision of Warner Bros. Marketing Services, \"Our goal is to create\ncompanion programming that offers new and exciting ways to engage the\naudience, just as music videos did for record promotion.\"[189] Allison Mack\ndescribed the show as \"very [Nancy Drew](/wiki/Nancy_Drew \"Nancy Drew\") and\nmysterious\": \"I think it's a bit more like _[The X-Files](/wiki/The_X-Files\n\"The X-Files\")_ or _[NYPD Blue](/wiki/NYPD_Blue \"NYPD Blue\")_. The Chronicles\nare like a detective story, with Chloe following clues and interviewing\npeople, going from spot to spot, figuring things out.\"[192] The scripts were\nwritten by Brice Tidwell; Mack was given script approval for the series,\nallowing her to review and make changes to the script. Warshaw communicated\nwith Gough and Millar to expand _Smallville_ stories in _Chloe 's\nChronicles_.[192]\n\n### Promotional tie-\nins[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section:\nPromotional tie-ins\")]\n\nFor the [season-three premiere](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_3\\)#ep45 \"Smallville\n\\(season 3\\)\"), the _Smallville_ producers teamed up with\n[Verizon](/wiki/Verizon_Communications \"Verizon Communications\") to enable its\nregistered users to view plot updates (as _Daily Planet_ press releases),\nquizzes and games related to the show with Verizon [product\nplacement](/wiki/Product_placement \"Product placement\").[193] _Smallville\nLegends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles_ , a six-episode [CGI](/wiki/Computer-\ngenerated_imagery \"Computer-generated imagery\") series chronicling the early\nlife of [Oliver Queen](/wiki/Green_Arrow \"Green Arrow\"), was released in a\npromotional tie-in with [Sprint](/wiki/Sprint_Nextel \"Sprint Nextel\").\nAccording to Warner Bros. Television Group executive vice-president of\nworldwide marketing Lisa Gregorian, the promotional tie-ins got fans more\nconnected to the show.[194] On April 19, 2007 a tie-in with\n[Toyota](/wiki/Toyota \"Toyota\") promoting the\n[Yaris](/wiki/Toyota_Motor_Corporation \"Toyota Motor Corporation\") featured an\nonline comic strip, _Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom_, as an [interstitial\nprogram](/wiki/Interstitial_program \"Interstitial program\") during new\n_Smallville_ episodes.[195] The interactive comic was based on the\n\"[Justice](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_6\\)#ep121 \"Smallville \\(season 6\\)\")\"\nepisode, which follows Oliver Queen, Bart Allen, Victor Stone and Arthur Curry\n(the initial members of the [\"Justice\nLeague\"](/wiki/Justice_League_\\(Smallville\\) \"Justice League \\(Smallville\\)\")\nin _Smallville_) as they seek to destroy LuthorCorp's secret experimental\nlabs. The online series allowed viewers to investigate with the fictional team\nto win prizes. Stephan Nilson wrote all five episodes, working with a team of\nartists on the illustrations. Nilson received the plot for each comic episode\nas _Smallville_ 's production crew was filming its current television episode.\nArtist Steve Scott drew comic-book panels which were sent to Motherland, a\nconsulting group. Motherland reviewed the drawings, telling Scott which images\nto draw on a separate overlay; this allowed objects to be moved in and out of\na frame.[196]\n\nIn 2008 The CW joined the manufacturers of [Stride](/wiki/Stride_\\(gum\\)\n\"Stride \\(gum\\)\") gum to give viewers an opportunity to create their own\n_Smallville_ digital comic, _Smallville: Visions_.[197] The writers and\nproducers developed the comic's beginning and end, allowing viewers to provide\nthe middle. The CW began its tie-in campaign with the March 13, 2008 episode\n\"[Hero](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_7\\)#ep145 \"Smallville \\(season 7\\)\")\", where\nPete develops superhuman elasticity after chewing kryptonite-infused Stride\ngum. On The CW's website, viewers voted on one of two options (each adding\nfour pages to the comic) every Tuesday and Thursday until the campaign ended\non April 7.[198] In [season seven](/wiki/Smallville_\\(season_7\\) \"Smallville\n\\(season 7\\)\") _Smallville_ again worked with Sprint, bringing its customers\n\"mobisodes\" entitled _Smallville Legends: Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton_\nwith Clark's cousin Kara.[199][200]\n\n### Spin-offs[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Spin-offs\")]\n\nGough and Millar developed an [_Aquaman_ pilot](/wiki/Aquaman_\\(TV_program\\)\n\"Aquaman \\(TV program\\)\") for The WB, with [Justin\nHartley](/wiki/Justin_Hartley \"Justin Hartley\") as [Aquaman (Arthur\nCurry)](/wiki/Aquaman \"Aquaman\").[201] As work progressed on the _Smallville_\nseason-five episode \"Aqua\", although the episode was not intended as a\n[backdoor pilot](/wiki/Backdoor_pilot \"Backdoor pilot\") for an\n[Aquaman](/wiki/Aquaman \"Aquaman\") spin-off[202] the character was seen as\nhaving potential for his own series.[203] Alan Ritchson was not considered for\nthe role in the new series, because Gough and Millar did not consider it a\n_Smallville_ spin-off. Gough said in November 2005, \"[The series] is going to\nbe a different version of the 'Aquaman' legend\"[203] and suggested a crossover\nwith _Smallville_ at some point.[204] Although the pilot was given a good\nchance of being picked up, when The WB and [UPN](/wiki/UPN \"UPN\") merged into\nThe CW the new network passed on the show.[205][206][207]\n\nDuring the sixth season there was talk of spinning off the [Green\nArrow](/wiki/Green_Arrow \"Green Arrow\") into his own series, but Hartley\nrefused to talk about the possibility of a spin-off because of his role on\n_Smallville_. The actor felt it his duty to respect what the show had\naccomplished in five seasons, and not \"steal the spotlight\" because there was\n\"talk\" of a spin-off after his two appearances. According to Hartley,\n\"talking\" was as far as the spin-off idea ever got.[208]\n\n## Home video[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Smallville&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Home video\")]\n\nSeasons one through ten have been released on DVD in [Regions 1, 2 and\n4](/wiki/DVD_region_code \"DVD region code\").
