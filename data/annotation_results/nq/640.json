It later reached No. 8 on the UK singles chart in 1971.\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Diamond stated the inspiration for his song was [John F.\nKennedy](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy \"John F. Kennedy\")'s daughter,\n[Caroline](/wiki/Caroline_Kennedy \"Caroline Kennedy\"), who was eleven years\nold at the time it was released.[5][6] Diamond sang the song to her at her\n50th birthday celebration in 2007.[7] On December 21, 2011, in an interview on\nCBS's _[The Early Show](/wiki/The_Early_Show \"The Early Show\")_ , Diamond said\nthat a magazine cover photo of Caroline Kennedy as a young child on a horse\nwith her parents in the background created an image in his mind, and the rest\nof the song came together about five years after seeing the picture.[8]\nHowever, in 2014 Diamond said the song was about his then-wife Marsha, but he\nneeded a three-syllable name to fit the melody.[8]\n\nThe song has proven to be enduringly popular and, as of November 2014, has\nsold over two million [digital downloads](/wiki/Music_download \"Music\ndownload\") in the United States.[9]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Chart history\n    * 1.1 Weekly charts\n    * 1.2 Year-end charts\n  * 2 Versions\n  * 3 Use at sporting events\n  * 4 Personnel\n  * 5 Cover versions\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Chart\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sweet_Caroline&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Chart history\")]\n\n### Weekly\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sweet_Caroline&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Weekly charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1969) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nAustralia [KMR](/wiki/Kent_Music_Report \"Kent Music Report\") | 3  \nCanada _[RPM](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\")_ Top Singles[10] | 3  \nCanada _[RPM](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\")_ Adult Contemporary[11] | 2  \nUS _[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_ [Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\")[12] | 4  \nUS _Billboard_ [Adult Contemporary](/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_\\(chart\\) \"Adult Contemporary \\(chart\\)\")[13] | 3  \nUS [_Cash Box_](/wiki/Cash_Box_\\(magazine\\) \"Cash Box \\(magazine\\)\") Top 100[14] | 3  \nChart (1971) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nGermany | 37  \nIreland ([IRMA](/wiki/Irish_Singles_Chart \"Irish Singles Chart\"))[15] | 9  \n[Netherlands](/wiki/Single_Top_100 \"Single Top 100\") | 16  \n[UK](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\") ([OCC](/wiki/The_Official_Charts_Company \"The Official Charts Company\")) | 8  \n  \n### Year-end\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sweet_Caroline&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Year-end charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1969) | Rank  \n---|---  \nCanada _RPM_ Top Singles[16] | 37  \nUS _Billboard_ Hot 100[17] | 22  \nUS _Cash Box_ [18] | 26  \n  \n## Versions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sweet_Caroline&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Versions\")]\n\nThere are three distinct mixes of this song.
