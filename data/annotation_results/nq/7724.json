In the North Atlantic it separates the\n[Eurasian](/wiki/Eurasian_Plate \"Eurasian Plate\") and [North American\nPlates](/wiki/North_American_Plate \"North American Plate\"), and in the South\nAtlantic it separates the [African](/wiki/African_Plate \"African Plate\") and\n[South American Plates](/wiki/South_American_Plate \"South American Plate\").\nThe ridge extends from a junction with the [Gakkel Ridge](/wiki/Gakkel_Ridge\n\"Gakkel Ridge\") (Mid-Arctic Ridge) northeast of [Greenland](/wiki/Greenland\n\"Greenland\") southward to the [Bouvet Triple\nJunction](/wiki/Bouvet_Triple_Junction \"Bouvet Triple Junction\") in the South\nAtlantic. Although the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is mostly an underwater feature,\nportions of it have enough elevation to extend above sea level. The section of\nthe ridge that includes [Iceland](/wiki/Iceland \"Iceland\") is known as the\n**Reykjanes Ridge**. The ridge has an average spreading rate of about 2.5\ncentimetres (0.98 in) per year.[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Discovery\n  * 2 Notable features\n  * 3 Islands\n  * 4 Geology\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Bibliography\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Discovery[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mid-\nAtlantic_Ridge&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Discovery\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Pangea_animation_03.gif)](/wiki/File:Pangea_animation_03.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pangea_animation_03.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nPangaea's separation animated\n\nA ridge under the Atlantic Ocean was first inferred by [Matthew Fontaine\nMaury](/wiki/Matthew_Fontaine_Maury \"Matthew Fontaine Maury\") in 1850. The\nexistence of the ridge was discovered during the [expedition of HMS\n_Challenger_](/wiki/Challenger_expedition \"Challenger expedition\") in 1872.[2]\nA team of scientists on board, led by [Charles Wyville\nThomson](/wiki/Charles_Wyville_Thomson \"Charles Wyville Thomson\"), discovered\na large rise in the middle of the Atlantic while investigating the future\nlocation for a [transatlantic telegraph\ncable](/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable \"Transatlantic telegraph\ncable\").[3] The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925[4]\nand was found to extend around the [Cape of Good Hope](/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope\n\"Cape of Good Hope\") into the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean \"Indian\nOcean\") by the [German Meteor expedition](/wiki/German_Meteor_expedition\n\"German Meteor expedition\").[5]\n\nIn the 1950s, mapping of the [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\")'s ocean floors by\n[Bruce Heezen](/wiki/Bruce_C._Heezen \"Bruce C. Heezen\"), [Maurice\nEwing](/wiki/Maurice_Ewing \"Maurice Ewing\"), [Marie Tharp](/wiki/Marie_Tharp\n\"Marie Tharp\") and others revealed that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge had a strange\n[bathymetry](/wiki/Bathymetry \"Bathymetry\") of valleys and ridges,[6] with its\ncentral valley being [seismologically](/wiki/Seismology \"Seismology\") active\nand the [epicenter](/wiki/Epicenter \"Epicenter\") of many\n[earthquakes](/wiki/Earthquake \"Earthquake\").[7][8] Ewing, Heezen and Tharp\ndiscovered that the ridge is part of a 40,000-km-long essentially continuous\nsystem of [mid-ocean ridges](/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge \"Mid-ocean ridge\") on the\nfloors of all the Earth’s oceans.[9] The discovery of this worldwide ridge\nsystem led to the theory of [seafloor spreading](/wiki/Seafloor_spreading\n\"Seafloor spreading\") and general acceptance of [Wegener](/wiki/Alfred_Wegener\n\"Alfred Wegener\")'s theory of [continental drift](/wiki/Continental_drift\n\"Continental drift\") and expansion in the modified form of [plate\ntectonics](/wiki/Plate_tectonics \"Plate tectonics\"). The ridge is central to\nthe breakup of the hypothetical [supercontinent](/wiki/Supercontinent\n\"Supercontinent\") of [Pangaea](/wiki/Pangaea \"Pangaea\") that began some 180\nmillion years ago.\n\n## Notable features[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mid-\nAtlantic_Ridge&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Notable features\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Iceland_Mid-\nAtlantic_Ridge_Fig16.gif/150px-Iceland_Mid-\nAtlantic_Ridge_Fig16.gif)](/wiki/File:Iceland_Mid-Atlantic_Ridge_Fig16.gif)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Iceland_mid_atlantic_ridge.JPG/205px-\nIceland_mid_atlantic_ridge.JPG)](/wiki/File:Iceland_mid_atlantic_ridge.JPG)\n\nIn Iceland the Mid-Atlantic Ridge passes across the\n[Þingvellir](/wiki/%C3%9Eingvellir \"Þingvellir\") National Park, a popular\ndestination for tourists\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep [rift valley](/wiki/Rift_valley \"Rift\nvalley\") that runs along the axis of the ridge along nearly its entire length.\nThis rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where\n[magma](/wiki/Magma \"Magma\") from the [mantle](/wiki/Mantle_\\(geology\\)\n\"Mantle \\(geology\\)\") reaches the seafloor, erupting as [lava](/wiki/Lava\n\"Lava\") and producing new [crustal](/wiki/Oceanic_crust \"Oceanic crust\")\nmaterial for the plates.\n\nNear the [equator](/wiki/Equator \"Equator\"), the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is divided\ninto the North Atlantic Ridge and the South Atlantic Ridge by the [Romanche\nTrench](/wiki/Romanche_Trench \"Romanche Trench\"), a narrow submarine trench\nwith a maximum depth of 7,758 m (25,453 ft), one of the deepest locations of\nthe Atlantic Ocean. This trench, however, is not regarded as the boundary\nbetween the North and South American Plates, nor the Eurasian and African\nPlates.\n\n## Islands[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Mid-Atlantic_Ridge&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Islands\")]\n\nThe islands on or near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, from north to south, with their\nrespective highest peaks and location, are:\n\n**Northern Hemisphere (North Atlantic Ridge)** :\n\n  1.

This bulge is\nthought to be caused by upward convective forces in the\n[asthenosphere](/wiki/Asthenosphere \"Asthenosphere\") pushing the [oceanic\ncrust](/wiki/Oceanic_crust \"Oceanic crust\") and\n[lithosphere](/wiki/Lithosphere \"Lithosphere\"). This divergent boundary first\nformed in the [Triassic](/wiki/Triassic \"Triassic\") period, when a series of\n[three-armed](/wiki/Triple_junction \"Triple junction\") [grabens](/wiki/Graben\n\"Graben\") coalesced on the supercontinent [Pangaea](/wiki/Pangaea \"Pangaea\")\nto form the ridge. Usually, only two arms of any given three-armed graben\nbecome part of a divergent plate boundary. The failed arms are called\n_[aulacogens](/wiki/Aulacogen \"Aulacogen\")_ , and the aulacogens of the Mid-\nAtlantic Ridge eventually became many of the large river valleys seen along\nthe [Americas](/wiki/Americas \"Americas\") and [Africa](/wiki/Africa \"Africa\")\n(including the [Mississippi River](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi\nRiver\"), [Amazon River](/wiki/Amazon_River \"Amazon River\") and [Niger\nRiver](/wiki/Niger_River \"Niger River\")).
