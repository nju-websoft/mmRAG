[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"),\nthe United States dropped [nuclear weapons](/wiki/Nuclear_weapon \"Nuclear\nweapon\") on the Japanese cities of [Hiroshima](/wiki/Hiroshima \"Hiroshima\")\nand [Nagasaki](/wiki/Nagasaki \"Nagasaki\") on August 6 and 9, 1945,\nrespectively. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the\nUnited Kingdom as outlined in the [Quebec Agreement](/wiki/Quebec_Agreement\n\"Quebec Agreement\"). The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (most of\nwhom were civilians) and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in the history\nof warfare.\n\nIn the final year of the war, the [Allies](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II\n\"Allies of World War II\") prepared for what was anticipated to be a very\ncostly [invasion of the Japanese mainland](/wiki/Operation_Downfall \"Operation\nDownfall\"). This undertaking was preceded by a U.S. [conventional and\nfirebombing campaign](/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan \"Air raids on Japan\") that\ndestroyed 67 Japanese cities. The [war in\nEurope](/wiki/European_theatre_of_World_War_II \"European theatre of World War\nII\") had concluded when [Germany](/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi Germany\") signed\nits [instrument of surrender](/wiki/German_Instrument_of_Surrender \"German\nInstrument of Surrender\") on May 8, 1945, which was eight days after [Adolf\nHitler committed suicide](/wiki/Death_of_Adolf_Hitler \"Death of Adolf\nHitler\"). The Japanese were facing the same fate but refused to accept the\nAllies' demands for [unconditional surrender](/wiki/Unconditional_surrender\n\"Unconditional surrender\"), and the war in the [Pacific\nTheatre](/wiki/Pacific_War \"Pacific War\") continued. The Allies called for the\nunconditional surrender of the [Imperial Japanese armed\nforces](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_armed_forces \"Imperial Japanese armed forces\")\nin the [Potsdam Declaration](/wiki/Potsdam_Declaration \"Potsdam Declaration\")\non July 26, 1945—the alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\". The\nJapanese [ignored](/wiki/Mokusatsu \"Mokusatsu\") the ultimatum and the war\ncontinued.\n\nBy August 1945, the Allies' [Manhattan Project](/wiki/Manhattan_Project\n\"Manhattan Project\") had produced two types of atomic bomb, and the [509th\nComposite Group](/wiki/509th_Composite_Group \"509th Composite Group\") of the\n[United States Army Air Forces](/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces \"United\nStates Army Air Forces\") (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized\n[Silverplate](/wiki/Silverplate \"Silverplate\") version of the [Boeing B-29\nSuperfortress](/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress \"Boeing B-29 Superfortress\")\nthat could deliver them from [Tinian](/wiki/Tinian \"Tinian\") in the [Mariana\nIslands](/wiki/Mariana_Islands \"Mariana Islands\"). Orders for atomic bombs to\nbe used on four Japanese cities were issued on July 25. On August 6, the U.S.\ndropped a [uranium](/wiki/Uranium \"Uranium\") [gun-type](/wiki/Gun-\ntype_fission_weapon \"Gun-type fission weapon\") ([Little Boy](/wiki/Little_Boy\n\"Little Boy\")) bomb on Hiroshima, and American President [Harry S.\nTruman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S. Truman\") called for Japan's surrender,\nwarning it to \"expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never\nbeen seen on this earth.\" Three days later, on August 9, a\n[plutonium](/wiki/Plutonium \"Plutonium\") [implosion-type](/wiki/Implosion-\ntype_nuclear_weapon \"Implosion-type nuclear weapon\") ([Fat Man](/wiki/Fat_Man\n\"Fat Man\")) bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Within the first two to four months\nfollowing the bombings, the acute effects of the atomic bombings had killed\n90,000–146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000–80,000 in Nagasaki; roughly half\nof the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. During the following\nmonths, large numbers died from the effect of burns, [radiation\nsickness](/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome \"Acute radiation syndrome\"), and\nother injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most\nof the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military\ngarrison.\n\nJapan announced [its surrender](/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan \"Surrender of Japan\")\nto the Allies on August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the\n[Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\")'s [declaration of\nwar](/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_War_\\(1945\\) \"Soviet–Japanese War\n\\(1945\\)\"). On September 2, the Japanese government signed the [instrument of\nsurrender](/wiki/Japanese_Instrument_of_Surrender \"Japanese Instrument of\nSurrender\"), effectively [ending World War\nII](/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Asia \"End of World War II in Asia\").

Japan still had control of all\nof [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria \"Manchuria\"), [Korea](/wiki/Korea \"Korea\"),\n[Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\") and [Indochina](/wiki/Indochina \"Indochina\"),\na large part of China, including most of the main Chinese cities, and much of\nthe [Dutch East Indies](/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies \"Dutch East Indies\").\n\nIn 1945, the [Pacific War](/wiki/Pacific_War \"Pacific War\") between the\n[Empire of Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan \"Empire of Japan\") and the\n[Allies](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II \"Allies of World War II\") entered its\nfourth year. The Japanese fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory\nwould come at an enormous cost. The 1.25 million battle casualties that were\nincurred by the United States in [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War\nII\") included both [military personnel](/wiki/Military_personnel \"Military\npersonnel\") [killed in action](/wiki/Killed_in_action \"Killed in action\") and\n[wounded in action](/wiki/Wounded_in_action \"Wounded in action\"). Nearly one\nmillion of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June\n1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-\ntime monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German [Ardennes\nOffensive](/wiki/Ardennes_Offensive \"Ardennes Offensive\").[1] In the Pacific,\nthe Allies [returned to the\nPhilippines](/wiki/Philippines_Campaign_\\(1944%E2%80%931945\\) \"Philippines\nCampaign \\(1944–1945\\)\"),[2] [recaptured\nBurma](/wiki/Burma_Campaign_1944%E2%80%931945 \"Burma Campaign 1944–1945\"),[3]\nand [invaded Borneo](/wiki/Borneo_campaign_\\(1945\\) \"Borneo campaign\n\\(1945\\)\").[4] Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces\nremaining in [Bougainville](/wiki/Bougainville_Campaign \"Bougainville\nCampaign\"), [New Guinea](/wiki/Aitape%E2%80%93Wewak_campaign \"Aitape–Wewak\ncampaign\") and the Philippines.[5] In April 1945, American forces [landed on\nOkinawa](/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa \"Battle of Okinawa\"), where heavy fighting\ncontinued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American\ncasualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa.[1]\n\nAlthough some Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner, most fought until they\nwere killed or committed [suicide](/wiki/Suicide \"Suicide\"). Nearly 99% of the\n21,000 defenders of [Iwo Jima](/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima \"Battle of Iwo Jima\")\nwere killed. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending\n[Okinawa](/wiki/Okinawa_Island \"Okinawa Island\") in April–June 1945, 94% were\nkilled. American military leaders used these figures to estimate high\ncasualties among American soldiers in the planned invasion of Japan.[6]\n\nAs the Allies advanced towards Japan, conditions became steadily worse for the\nJapanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 [gross\ntons](/wiki/Gross_register_tonnage \"Gross register tonnage\") in 1941 to\n1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw\nmaterials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the\nmiddle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout\nthe war, reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945. The loss of shipping\nalso affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in\n1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and\nmalnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly\nsuperior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a\nyear, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war.

Air bases were developed,[27] and\nB-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944.[28] These bases\nwere easily resupplied by cargo ships.[29] The [XXI Bomber\nCommand](/wiki/XXI_Bomber_Command \"XXI Bomber Command\") began missions against\nJapan on November 18, 1944.[30]\n\nThe early attempts to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective\nas the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued the practice of\nconducting so-called high-altitude [precision bombing](/wiki/Precision_bombing\n\"Precision bombing\"), aimed at key industries and transportation networks,\neven after these tactics had not produced acceptable results.[31] These\nefforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote\nlocation, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable\nweather conditions, and enemy action.[32][33]\n\n[![A vast devastated area with only a few burned out buildings\nstanding](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Tokyo_1945-3-10-1.jpg/220px-\nTokyo_1945-3-10-1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tokyo_1945-3-10-1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tokyo_1945-3-10-1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe _Operation Meetinghouse_ [firebombing of Tokyo](/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo\n\"Bombing of Tokyo\") on the night of March 9–10, 1945, was the single deadliest\nair raid in history;[34] with a greater area of fire damage and loss of life\nthan either of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima or Nagasaki.[35][36]\n\nHansell's successor, [Major General](/wiki/Major_General_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Major General \\(United States\\)\") [Curtis LeMay](/wiki/Curtis_LeMay \"Curtis\nLeMay\"), assumed command in January 1945 and initially continued to use the\nsame precision bombing tactics, with equally unsatisfactory results. The\nattacks initially targeted key industrial facilities but much of the Japanese\nmanufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private\nhomes.[37] Under pressure from USAAF headquarters in Washington, LeMay changed\ntactics and decided that low-level [incendiary raids](/wiki/Firebombing\n\"Firebombing\") against Japanese cities were the only way to destroy their\nproduction capabilities, shifting from precision bombing to [area\nbombardment](/wiki/Area_bombardment \"Area bombardment\") with incendiaries.[38]\n\nLike most [strategic bombing during World War\nII](/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II \"Strategic bombing during\nWorld War II\"), the aim of the USAAF offensive against Japan was to destroy\nthe enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these\nindustries, and [undermine civilian morale](/wiki/Demoralization_\\(warfare\\)\n\"Demoralization \\(warfare\\)\"). Civilians who took part in the [war\neffort](/wiki/War_effort \"War effort\") through such activities as building\n[fortifications](/wiki/Fortification \"Fortification\") and manufacturing\nmunitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered\n[combatants](/wiki/Combatants \"Combatants\") in a legal sense and therefore\nliable to be attacked.[39][40]\n\nOver the next six months, the XXI Bomber Command under LeMay firebombed 67\nJapanese cities. The [firebombing of Tokyo](/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo \"Bombing of\nTokyo\"), codenamed _Operation Meetinghouse_ , on March 9–10 killed an\nestimated 100,000 people and destroyed 16 square miles (41 km2) of the city\nand 267,000 buildings in a single night. It was the deadliest bombing raid of\nthe war, at a cost of 20 B-29s shot down by flak and fighters.[41] By May, 75%\nof bombs dropped were incendiaries designed to burn down Japan's \"paper\ncities\". By mid-June, Japan's six largest cities had been devastated.[42] The\nend of the [fighting on Okinawa](/wiki/Fighting_on_Okinawa \"Fighting on\nOkinawa\") that month provided airfields even closer to the Japanese mainland,\nallowing the bombing campaign to be further escalated. Aircraft flying from\nAllied [aircraft carriers](/wiki/Aircraft_carrier \"Aircraft carrier\") and the\n[Ryukyu Islands](/wiki/Ryukyu_Islands \"Ryukyu Islands\") also regularly struck\ntargets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for Operation Downfall.[43]\nFirebombing switched to smaller cities, with populations ranging from 60,000\nto 350,000. According to [Yuki Tanaka](/wiki/Yuki_Tanaka_\\(historian\\) \"Yuki\nTanaka \\(historian\\)\"), the U.S. fire-bombed over a hundred Japanese towns and\ncities.[44] These raids were also devastating.[45]\n\nThe Japanese military was unable to stop the Allied attacks and the country's\n[civil defense](/wiki/Civil_defense \"Civil defense\") preparations proved\ninadequate. Japanese fighters and antiaircraft guns had difficulty engaging\nbombers flying at high altitude.[46] From April 1945, the Japanese\ninterceptors also had to face American fighter escorts based on [Iwo\nJima](/wiki/Iwo_Jima \"Iwo Jima\") and Okinawa.[47] That month, the [Imperial\nJapanese Army Air Service](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army_Air_Service \"Imperial\nJapanese Army Air Service\") and [Imperial Japanese Navy Air\nService](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy_Air_Service \"Imperial Japanese Navy Air\nService\") stopped attempting to intercept the air raids in order to preserve\nfighter aircraft to counter the expected invasion.[48] By mid-1945 the\nJapanese only occasionally scrambled aircraft to intercept individual B-29s\nconducting reconnaissance sorties over the country, in order to conserve\nsupplies of fuel.[49] By July 1945, the Japanese had stockpiled 1,156,000 US\nbarrels (137,800,000 l; 36,400,000 US gal; 30,300,000 imp gal) of\n[avgas](/wiki/Avgas \"Avgas\") for the invasion of Japan.[50] While the Japanese\nmilitary decided to resume attacks on Allied bombers from late June, by this\ntime there were too few operational fighters available for this change of\ntactics to hinder the Allied air raids.[51]\n\n### Atomic bomb development\n\nMain article: [Manhattan Project](/wiki/Manhattan_Project \"Manhattan Project\")\n\nThe discovery of [nuclear fission](/wiki/Nuclear_fission \"Nuclear fission\") by\nGerman chemists [Otto Hahn](/wiki/Otto_Hahn \"Otto Hahn\") and [Fritz\nStrassmann](/wiki/Fritz_Strassmann \"Fritz Strassmann\") in 1938, and its\ntheoretical explanation by [Lise Meitner](/wiki/Lise_Meitner \"Lise Meitner\")\nand [Otto Frisch](/wiki/Otto_Frisch \"Otto Frisch\"), made the development of an\natomic bomb a theoretical possibility.[52] Fears that a [German atomic bomb\nproject](/wiki/German_atomic_bomb_project \"German atomic bomb project\") would\ndevelop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees\nfrom Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the\n[Einstein-Szilard letter](/wiki/Einstein-Szilard_letter \"Einstein-Szilard\nletter\"). This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late\n1939.[53] Progress was slow until the arrival of the British [MAUD\nCommittee](/wiki/MAUD_Committee \"MAUD Committee\") report in late 1941, which\nindicated that only 5–10 kilograms of isotopically enriched\n[uranium-235](/wiki/Uranium-235 \"Uranium-235\") was needed for a bomb instead\nof tons of un-enriched uranium and a neutron moderator (e.g. [heavy\nwater](/wiki/Heavy_water \"Heavy water\")).[54]\n\nWorking in collaboration with the United Kingdom and Canada, with their\nrespective projects [Tube Alloys](/wiki/Tube_Alloys \"Tube Alloys\") and [Chalk\nRiver Laboratories](/wiki/Chalk_River_Laboratories \"Chalk River\nLaboratories\"),[55][56] the [Manhattan Project](/wiki/Manhattan_Project\n\"Manhattan Project\"), under the direction of Major General [Leslie R.

The target selection\nwas subject to the following criteria:\n\n  * The target was larger than 3 mi (4.8 km) in diameter and was an important target in a large city.\n  * The blast would create effective damage.\n  * The target was unlikely to be attacked by August 1945.[73]\n\nThese cities were largely untouched during the nightly bombing raids and the\nArmy Air Forces agreed to leave them off the target list so accurate\nassessment of the weapon could be made. Hiroshima was described as \"an\nimportant army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban\nindustrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large\npart of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which\nare likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the\nblast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good\n[incendiary](/wiki/Incendiary_device \"Incendiary device\") target.\"[73]\n\nThe Target Committee stated that \"It was agreed that psychological factors in\nthe target selection were of great importance. Two aspects of this are (1)\nobtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan and (2) making the\ninitial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be\ninternationally recognized when publicity on it is released. Kyoto had the\nadvantage of being an important center for military industry, as well an\nintellectual center and hence a population better able to appreciate the\nsignificance of the weapon. The [Emperor's palace](/wiki/Tokyo_Imperial_Palace\n\"Tokyo Imperial Palace\") in Tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but\nis of least strategic value.\"[73]\n\n[Edwin O. Reischauer](/wiki/Edwin_O._Reischauer \"Edwin O. Reischauer\"), a\nJapan expert for the [U.S. Army Intelligence\nService](/wiki/Military_Intelligence_Corps_\\(United_States_Army\\) \"Military\nIntelligence Corps \\(United States Army\\)\"), was incorrectly said to have\nprevented the bombing of Kyoto.[73] In his autobiography, Reischauer\nspecifically refuted this claim:\n\n> ... the only person deserving credit for saving Kyoto from destruction is\n> Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, who had known and\n> admired Kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades\n> earlier.[74][75]\n\nOn May 30, Stimson asked Groves to remove Kyoto from the target list due to\nits historical, religious and cultural significance, but Groves pointed to its\nmilitary and industrial significance.[76] Stimson then approached\n[President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\") [Harry S. Truman](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S. Truman\") about the\nmatter. Truman agreed with Stimson, and Kyoto was temporarily removed from the\ntarget list.[77] Groves attempted to restore Kyoto to the target list in July,\nbut Stimson remained adamant.[78][79] On July 25, [Nagasaki](/wiki/Nagasaki\n\"Nagasaki\") was put on the target list in place of Kyoto.[79]\n\n### Proposed demonstration\n\nIn early May 1945, the [Interim Committee](/wiki/Interim_Committee \"Interim\nCommittee\") was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan\nProject and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to\n[nuclear energy](/wiki/Nuclear_technology \"Nuclear technology\").[80] During\nthe meetings on May 31 and June 1, scientist [Ernest\nLawrence](/wiki/Ernest_Lawrence \"Ernest Lawrence\") had suggested giving the\nJapanese a non-combat demonstration.[81] [Arthur Compton](/wiki/Arthur_Compton\n\"Arthur Compton\") later recalled that:\n\n> It was evident that everyone would suspect trickery. If a bomb were exploded\n> in Japan with previous notice, the Japanese air power was still adequate to\n> give serious interference. An atomic bomb was an intricate device, still in\n> the developmental stage. Its operation would be far from routine. If during\n> the final adjustments of the bomb the Japanese defenders should attack, a\n> faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure. Such an end to an\n> advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt\n> had not been made. It was now evident that when the time came for the bombs\n> to be used we should have only one of them available, followed afterwards by\n> others at all-too-long intervals. We could not afford the chance that one of\n> them might be a dud. If the test were made on some neutral territory, it was\n> hard to believe that Japan's determined and fanatical military men would be\n> impressed. If such an open test were made first and failed to bring\n> surrender, the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that\n> proved so effective. On the contrary, it would make the Japanese ready to\n> interfere with an atomic attack if they could. Though the possibility of a\n> demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive, no one\n> could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be\n> likely to stop the war.[82]\n\nThe possibility of a demonstration was raised again in the [Franck\nReport](/wiki/Franck_Report \"Franck Report\") issued by physicist [James\nFranck](/wiki/James_Franck \"James Franck\") on June 11 and the Scientific\nAdvisory Panel rejected his report on June 16, saying that \"we can propose no\ntechnical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no\nacceptable alternative to direct military use.\" Franck then took the report to\nWashington, D.C., where the Interim Committee met on June 21 to re-examine its\nearlier conclusions; but it reaffirmed that there was no alternative to the\nuse of the bomb on a military target.[83]\n\nLike Compton, many U.S. officials and scientists argued that a demonstration\nwould sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could\ndeny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce\nsurrender. Allied [prisoners of war](/wiki/Prisoners_of_war \"Prisoners of\nwar\") might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They\nalso worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a\nstationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, only two bombs would\nbe available at the start of August, although more were in production, and\nthey cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be\nexpensive.[84][85]\n\n### Leaflets\n\n[![Leaflet showing B-29s dropping bombs. There are 12 circles with 12 Japanese\ncities named in Japanese\nwriting.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Firebombing_leaflet.jpg/220px-\nFirebombing_leaflet.jpg)](/wiki/File:Firebombing_leaflet.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Firebombing_leaflet.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nVarious leaflets were dropped on Japan, three versions showing the names of 11\nor 12 Japanese cities targeted for destruction by firebombing. The other side\ncontained text stating \"...we cannot promise that only these cities will be\namong those attacked ...\"[86]\n\nFor several months, the U.S. had warned civilians of potential air raids by\ndropping more than 63 million leaflets across Japan. Many Japanese cities\nsuffered terrible damage from aerial bombings; some were as much as 97%\ndestroyed. LeMay thought that leaflets would increase the psychological impact\nof bombing, and reduce the international stigma of area-bombing cities. Even\nwith the warnings, [Japanese opposition to the\nwar](/wiki/Japanese_resistance_to_the_Empire_of_Japan_in_World_War_II\n\"Japanese resistance to the Empire of Japan in World War II\") remained\nineffective. In general, the Japanese regarded the leaflet messages as\ntruthful, with many Japanese choosing to leave major cities. The leaflets\ncaused such concern amongst the Empire of Japan that they ordered the arrest\nof anyone caught in possession of a leaflet.[86][87] Leaflet texts were\nprepared by recent Japanese prisoners of war because they were thought to be\nthe best choice \"to appeal to their compatriots\".[88]\n\nIn preparation for dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Oppenheimer-led\n[Scientific Panel of the Interim Committee](/wiki/Interim_Committee \"Interim\nCommittee\") decided against a demonstration bomb and against a special leaflet\nwarning. Those decisions were implemented because of the uncertainty of a\nsuccessful detonation and also because of the wish to maximize [shock in the\nleadership](/wiki/Psychological_warfare \"Psychological warfare\").[89] No\nwarning was given to Hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was\ngoing to be dropped.[90] Various sources gave conflicting information about\nwhen the last leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb.\n[Robert Jay Lifton](/wiki/Robert_Jay_Lifton \"Robert Jay Lifton\") wrote that it\nwas July 27,[90] and Theodore H. McNelly wrote that it was July 3.[89] The\nUSAAF history noted that eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on July 27,\nbut Hiroshima was not one of them, and there were no leaflet sorties on July\n30.[87] Leaflet sorties were undertaken on August 1 and August 4. Hiroshima\nmay have been leafleted in late July or early August, as survivor accounts\ntalk about a delivery of leaflets a few days before the atomic bomb was\ndropped.[90] Three versions were printed of a leaflet listing 11 or 12 cities\ntargeted for firebombing; a total of 33 cities listed. With the text of this\nleaflet reading in Japanese \"...we cannot promise that only these cities will\nbe among those attacked...\"[86] Hiroshima is not listed.[91][92][93][94]\n\n### Consultation with Britain and Canada\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Handy_to_spaatz_1945.gif/170px-\nHandy_to_spaatz_1945.gif)](/wiki/File:Handy_to_spaatz_1945.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Handy_to_spaatz_1945.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nGeneral [Thomas Handy](/wiki/Thomas_Handy \"Thomas Handy\")'s order to General\n[Carl Spaatz](/wiki/Carl_Spaatz \"Carl Spaatz\") authorizing the dropping of the\natomic bombs\n\nUnder the 1943 [Quebec Agreement](/wiki/Quebec_Agreement \"Quebec Agreement\")\nwith the United Kingdom, nuclear weapons would not be used against another\ncountry without mutual consent. Stimson therefore had to obtain British\npermission. A meeting of the [Combined Policy\nCommittee](/wiki/Combined_Policy_Committee \"Combined Policy Committee\") was\nheld at [the Pentagon](/wiki/The_Pentagon \"The Pentagon\") on July 4, 1945.\nStimson and [Vannevar Bush](/wiki/Vannevar_Bush \"Vannevar Bush\") represented\nthe United States; Britain was represented by the head of the [British Joint\nStaff Mission](/wiki/British_Defence_Staff_%E2%80%93_US \"British Defence Staff\n– US\"), [Field Marshal](/wiki/Field_Marshal_\\(United_Kingdom\\) \"Field Marshal\n\\(United Kingdom\\)\") Sir [Henry Maitland\nWilson](/wiki/Henry_Maitland_Wilson,_1st_Baron_Wilson \"Henry Maitland Wilson,\n1st Baron Wilson\"); and Canada by [Clarence D. Howe](/wiki/Clarence_D._Howe\n\"Clarence D. Howe\"). In addition, [Harvey Bundy](/wiki/Harvey_Bundy \"Harvey\nBundy\"), Sir [James Chadwick](/wiki/James_Chadwick \"James Chadwick\"), Groves,\n[Lord Halifax](/wiki/Lord_Halifax \"Lord Halifax\"), [George L.\nHarrison](/wiki/George_L._Harrison \"George L. Harrison\"), and [Roger\nMakins](/wiki/Roger_Makins \"Roger Makins\") were all present at the meeting by\ninvitation.[95]\n\nWilson announced that the British government concurred with the use of nuclear\nweapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the\nCombined Policy Committee.[95][96][97] As the release of information to third\nparties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to\nwhat scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the\nbombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to [Joseph\nStalin](/wiki/Joseph_Stalin \"Joseph Stalin\"), the leader of the [Soviet\nUnion](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\"), at the upcoming [Potsdam\nConference](/wiki/Potsdam_Conference \"Potsdam Conference\").[95]\n\nOrders for the attack were issued to General [Carl Spaatz](/wiki/Carl_Spaatz\n\"Carl Spaatz\") on July 25 under the signature of General [Thomas T.\nHandy](/wiki/Thomas_T._Handy \"Thomas T. Handy\"), the acting Chief of Staff,\nsince Marshall was at the Potsdam Conference with Truman.[98] That day, Truman\nnoted in his diary that:\n\n> This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10th. I have\n> told the Sec. of War, Mr. Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and\n> soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the\n> Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the\n> world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old\n> capital [Kyoto] or the new [Tokyo]. He and I are in accord. The target will\n> be a purely military one.[99]\n\n### Potsdam Declaration\n\nMain article: [Potsdam Declaration](/wiki/Potsdam_Declaration \"Potsdam\nDeclaration\")\n\nThe July 16 success of the [Trinity Test](/wiki/Trinity_Test \"Trinity Test\")\nin the [New Mexico](/wiki/New_Mexico \"New Mexico\") desert exceeded\nexpectations.[100] On July 26, Allied leaders issued the [Potsdam\nDeclaration](/wiki/Potsdam_Declaration \"Potsdam Declaration\"), which outlined\nthe terms of surrender for Japan. The declaration was presented as an\n[ultimatum](/wiki/Ultimatum \"Ultimatum\") and stated that without a surrender,\nthe Allies would attack Japan, resulting in \"the inevitable and complete\ndestruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter\ndevastation of the Japanese homeland\". The atomic bomb was not mentioned in\nthe communiqué.[101]\n\nOn July 28, Japanese papers reported that the declaration had been rejected by\nthe Japanese government. That afternoon, [Prime\nMinister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan \"Prime Minister of Japan\") [Suzuki\nKantarō](/wiki/Suzuki_Kantar%C5%8D \"Suzuki Kantarō\") declared at a press\nconference that the Potsdam Declaration was no more than a rehash\n(_yakinaoshi_) of the [Cairo Declaration](/wiki/1943_Cairo_Declaration \"1943\nCairo Declaration\") and that the government intended to ignore it\n(_[mokusatsu](/wiki/Mokusatsu \"Mokusatsu\")_ , \"kill by silence\").[102] The\nstatement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection\nof the declaration. Emperor Hirohito, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to\nnon-committal Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government\nposition.[103] Japan's willingness to surrender remained conditional on the\npreservation of the imperial institution; that Japan not be occupied; that the\nJapanese armed forces be disbanded voluntarily; and that war criminals be\nprosecuted by Japanese courts.[104]\n\nAt Potsdam, Truman agreed to a request from [Winston\nChurchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill \"Winston Churchill\") that Britain be\nrepresented when the atomic bomb was dropped. [William\nPenney](/wiki/William_Penney \"William Penney\") and [Group\nCaptain](/wiki/Group_Captain \"Group Captain\") [Leonard\nCheshire](/wiki/Leonard_Cheshire \"Leonard Cheshire\") were sent to Tinian, but\nfound that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do\nwas send a strongly worded signal back to Wilson.[105]\n\n### Bombs\n\nThe Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the\nbeginning of May 1945.[106] The uranium-235 projectile was completed on June\n15, and the target insert on July 24.[107] The target and bomb pre-assemblies\n(partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left [Hunters Point\nNaval Shipyard](/wiki/Hunters_Point_Naval_Shipyard \"Hunters Point Naval\nShipyard\"), California, on July 16 aboard the [cruiser](/wiki/Cruiser\n\"Cruiser\") [USS  _Indianapolis_](/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_\\(CA-35\\) \"USS\nIndianapolis \\(CA-35\\)\"), and arrived on Tinian on July 26.[108] The target\ninserts followed by air on July 30.[107]\n\nThe first [plutonium core](/wiki/Plutonium_core \"Plutonium core\"), along with\nits [polonium](/wiki/Polonium \"Polonium\")-[beryllium](/wiki/Beryllium\n\"Beryllium\") [urchin initiator](/wiki/Urchin_\\(detonator\\) \"Urchin\n\\(detonator\\)\"), was transported in the custody of Project Alberta courier\n[Raemer Schreiber](/wiki/Raemer_Schreiber \"Raemer Schreiber\") in a magnesium\nfield carrying case designed for the purpose by [Philip\nMorrison](/wiki/Philip_Morrison \"Philip Morrison\"). Magnesium was chosen\nbecause it does not act as a [tamper](/wiki/Neutron_reflector \"Neutron\nreflector\").[109] The core departed from [Kirtland Army Air\nField](/wiki/Kirtland_Air_Force_Base \"Kirtland Air Force Base\") on a\n[C-54](/wiki/C-54 \"C-54\") transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's\n[320th Troop Carrier Squadron](/wiki/320th_Troop_Carrier_Squadron \"320th Troop\nCarrier Squadron\") on July 26, and arrived at North Field July 28. Three Fat\nMan high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked\nup at Kirtland on July 28 by three B-29s, two from the 393d Bombardment\nSquadron plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to\nNorth Field, arriving on August 2.[110]\n\n## Hiroshima\n\n### Hiroshima during World War II\n\n[![A Silver aircraft with \"Enola Gay\" and \"82\" painted on the nose.

In this\nphotograph are five of the aircraft's ground crew with mission commander [Paul\nTibbets](/wiki/Paul_Tibbets \"Paul Tibbets\") in the center.\n\nAt the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of both industrial and\nmilitary significance. A number of military units were located nearby, the\nmost important of which was the headquarters of [Field\nMarshal](/wiki/Gensui_\\(Imperial_Japanese_Army\\) \"Gensui \\(Imperial Japanese\nArmy\\)\") [Shunroku Hata](/wiki/Shunroku_Hata \"Shunroku Hata\")'s [Second\nGeneral Army](/wiki/Second_General_Army_\\(Japan\\) \"Second General Army\n\\(Japan\\)\"), which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan,[111] and\nwas located in [Hiroshima Castle](/wiki/Hiroshima_Castle \"Hiroshima Castle\").\nHata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu\nwhere an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated.[112] Also present in\nHiroshima were the headquarters of the [59th Army](/wiki/Fifty-\nNinth_Army_\\(Japan\\) \"Fifty-Ninth Army \\(Japan\\)\"), the [5th\nDivision](/wiki/5th_Division_\\(Imperial_Japanese_Army\\) \"5th Division\n\\(Imperial Japanese Army\\)\") and the [224th\nDivision](/wiki/224th_Division_\\(Imperial_Japanese_Army\\) \"224th Division\n\\(Imperial Japanese Army\\)\"), a recently formed mobile unit.[113] The city was\ndefended by five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) [anti-aircraft\nguns](/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare \"Anti-aircraft warfare\") of the 3rd Anti-\nAircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft\nRegiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In total,\nan estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the\ncity.[114]\n\nHiroshima was a minor supply and logistics base for the Japanese military, but\nit also had large stockpiles of military supplies.[115] The city was also a\ncommunications center, a key port for shipping and an assembly area for\ntroops.[76] It was a beehive of war industry, manufacturing parts for planes\nand boats, for bombs, rifles, and handguns; children were shown how to\nconstruct and hurl gasoline bombs and the wheelchair-bound and bedridden were\nassembling booby traps to be planted in the beaches of Kyushu. A new slogan\nappeared on the walls of Hiroshima: \"FORGET SELF! ALL OUT FOR YOUR\nCOUNTRY!\"[116] It was also the second largest city in Japan after Kyoto that\nwas still undamaged by air raids,[117] due to the fact that it lacked the\naircraft manufacturing industry that was the XXI Bomber Command's priority\ntarget. On July 3, the Joint Chiefs of Staff placed it off limits to bombers,\nalong with Kokura, Niigata and Kyoto.[118]\n\nThe center of the city contained several [reinforced\nconcrete](/wiki/Reinforced_concrete \"Reinforced concrete\") buildings and\nlighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense\ncollection of small timber-made workshops set among Japanese houses. A few\nlarger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were\nconstructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings\nwere also built around timber frames. The city as a whole was highly\nsusceptible to fire damage.[119]\n\nThe population of Hiroshima had reached a peak of over 381,000 earlier in the\nwar but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased\nbecause of a [systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese\ngovernment](/wiki/Evacuations_of_civilians_in_Japan_during_World_War_II\n\"Evacuations of civilians in Japan during World War II\"). At the time of the\nattack, the population was approximately 340,000–350,000.[120] Residents\nwondered why Hiroshima had been spared destruction by firebombing.[121] Some\nspeculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters,\nothers thought perhaps their relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned\nthe U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima.[122] More realistic city\nofficials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight\n[firebreaks](/wiki/Firebreak \"Firebreak\"), beginning in 1944.[123] Firebreaks\ncontinued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6,\n1945.[124]\n\n### Bombing of Hiroshima\n\n[![A mushroom cloud\nforming.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/Hirgrnd1.jpg/170px-\nHirgrnd1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hirgrnd1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hirgrnd1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSeizo Yamada's ground level photo taken approximately 7 km (4.3 mi) northeast\nof Hiroshima\n\n[![Another view of the mushroom cloud forming, from further\naway.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Hiroshima_10km.jpg/170px-\nHiroshima_10km.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hiroshima_10km.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hiroshima_10km.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPicture found in Honkawa Elementary School in 2013 of the Hiroshima atom bomb\ncloud, stated by some books and the [Hiroshima Peace\nMuseum](/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Museum \"Hiroshima Peace Museum\") as having been\ntaken about 30 minutes after detonation from about 10 km (6.2 mi) east of the\nhypocenter. However, experience on how quickly such clouds dissipate and\ncomparisons to other photos puts this frame at 2-3 minutes after detonation,\nnot 30 minutes.[125]\n\nHiroshima was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on\nAugust 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets.

The aircraft arrived over the target in clear\nvisibility at 31,060 feet (9,470 m).[129] Parsons, who was in command of the\nmission, armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during\ntakeoff. He had witnessed four B-29s crash and burn at takeoff, and feared\nthat a nuclear explosion would occur if a B-29 crashed with an armed Little\nBoy on board.[130] His assistant, [Second Lieutenant](/wiki/Second_Lieutenant\n\"Second Lieutenant\") [Morris R.

Without knowledge of the photo the output of energy from\nthe fuel in the city, necessary to [loft](/wiki/Cloud_formation \"Cloud\nformation\") a [stratospheric](/wiki/Stratospheric \"Stratospheric\") firestorm-\ncloud, had been estimated as 1000 times the energy of the bomb.[141] Post\nMarch estimates using the height of this Hiroshima-cloud also point at the\nunderlying [firestorm](/wiki/Firestorm \"Firestorm\") releasing approximately\n1000 times the energy of the bomb.[140] Twenty minutes after detonation,\nduring the formation of this firestorm, soot filled [black\nrain](/wiki/Black_Rain_\\(novel\\) \"Black Rain \\(novel\\)\") began to fall on\nsurvivors.[142] Scientist [Alan Robock](/wiki/Alan_Robock \"Alan Robock\")\nsuggests that 100 of these firestorm-clouds would create a _small_ \"[nuclear\nwinter](/wiki/Nuclear_winter \"Nuclear winter\")\", 1-2 C of global cooling.[143]\n\nDue to [crosswind](/wiki/Crosswind \"Crosswind\"), the bomb missed the [aiming\npoint](/wiki/Aiming_point \"Aiming point\"), the [Aioi Bridge](/wiki/Aioi_Bridge\n\"Aioi Bridge\"), by approximately 800 ft (240 m) and detonated directly over\n[Shima Surgical Clinic](/wiki/Shima_Hospital \"Shima Hospital\")[144] at\n[34°23′41″N 132°27′17″E﻿ / ﻿34.39468°N 132.45462°E﻿ / 34.39468;\n132.45462](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki&params=34.39468_N_132.45462_E_).\nIt released the equivalent energy of 16 [kilotons of TNT](/wiki/TNT_equivalent\n\"TNT equivalent\") (67 TJ), ± 2 kt.[136] The weapon was [considered very\ninefficient](/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_design#Gun-type_assembly_weapon \"Nuclear\nweapon design\"), with only 1.7% of its material fissioning.[145] The radius of\ntotal destruction was about 1 mile (1.6 km), with resulting fires across 4.4\nsquare miles (11 km2).[146]\n\nPeople on the ground reported seeing a _pika_ (ピカ)—a brilliant flash of\nlight—followed by a _don_ (ドン)—a loud booming sound.[147] Some 70,000–80,000\npeople, or around 30% of the population of Hiroshima, were killed by the blast\nand resultant firestorm,[148][149] and another 70,000 injured.[150] Perhaps as\nmany as 20,000 Japanese military personnel were killed.[151]\n\n_Enola Gay_ stayed over the target area for two minutes and was ten miles away\nwhen the bomb detonated. Only Tibbets, Parsons, and Ferebee knew of the nature\nof the weapon; the others on the bomber were only told to expect a blinding\nflash and given black goggles. \"It was hard to believe what we saw\", Tibbets\ntold reporters, while Parsons said \"the whole thing was tremendous and awe-\ninspiring ... the men aboard with me gasped 'My God'\". He and Tibbets compared\nthe shockwave to \"a close burst of [ack-ack](/wiki/Ack-ack \"Ack-ack\")\nfire\".[152]\n\n### Events on the ground\n\nSome of the reinforced concrete buildings in Hiroshima had been very strongly\nconstructed because of the earthquake danger in Japan, and their framework did\nnot collapse even though they were fairly close to the blast center. Since the\nbomb detonated in the air, the blast was directed more downward than sideways,\nwhich was largely responsible for the survival of the _[Prefectural Industrial\nPromotional Hall](/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial \"Hiroshima Peace Memorial\")_\n, now commonly known as the _Genbaku_ (A-bomb) dome. This building was\ndesigned and built by the Czech architect [Jan Letzel](/wiki/Jan_Letzel \"Jan\nLetzel\"), and was only 150 m (490 ft) from ground zero. The ruin was named\n_Hiroshima Peace Memorial_ and was made a UNESCO [World Heritage\nSite](/wiki/World_Heritage_Site \"World Heritage Site\") in 1996 over the\nobjections of the United States and China, which expressed reservations on the\ngrounds that other Asian nations were the ones who suffered the greatest loss\nof life and property, and a focus on Japan lacked historical perspective.[153]\n\nThe US surveys estimated that 4.7 square miles (12 km2) of the city were\ndestroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings\nwere destroyed and another 6–7% damaged.[154] The bombing started fires that\nspread rapidly through timber and paper homes. As in other Japanese cities,\nthe firebreaks proved ineffective.[155]\n\nHiroshima bombing  \n---  \n|  [![A devastated area very similar to the one of Tokyo\nabove](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Hiroshima_aftermath.jpg/150px-\nHiroshima_aftermath.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hiroshima_aftermath.jpg \"Hiroshima in the\naftermath of the bombing\")  \n---  \nHiroshima in the aftermath of the bombing  \n[![A typed page of\ninstructions](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Agnew_StrikeOrderHiroshima.jpg/128px-\nAgnew_StrikeOrderHiroshima.jpg)](/wiki/File:Agnew_StrikeOrderHiroshima.jpg\n\"Strike order for the Hiroshima bombing as posted on August 5, 1945\")  \n---  \n[Strike order](/wiki/Operations_Order_No._35 \"Operations Order No. 35\") for\nthe Hiroshima bombing as posted on August 5, 1945  \n[![People sitting and lying on the\nground](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Hiroshima_Street_Scene_with_injured_Civilians.jpg/150px-\nHiroshima_Street_Scene_with_injured_Civilians.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hiroshima_Street_Scene_with_injured_Civilians.jpg\n\"Injured civilian casualties\")  \n---  \nInjured civilian casualties  \n[![A burned out domed building surrounded by\nrubble](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Hiroshima_Dome_1945.gif/127px-\nHiroshima_Dome_1945.gif)](/wiki/File:Hiroshima_Dome_1945.gif \"The Hiroshima\nGenbaku Dome after the bombing\")  \n---  \nThe [Hiroshima Genbaku Dome](/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial \"Hiroshima Peace\nMemorial\") after the bombing  \n[![A woman's back, with chequered-shaped\nburns](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/The_patient%27s_skin_is_burned_in_a_pattern_corresponding_to_the_dark_portions_of_a_kimono_-\n_NARA_-_519686.jpg/150px-\nThe_patient%27s_skin_is_burned_in_a_pattern_corresponding_to_the_dark_portions_of_a_kimono_-\n_NARA_-_519686.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_patient%27s_skin_is_burned_in_a_pattern_corresponding_to_the_dark_portions_of_a_kimono_-\n_NARA_-_519686.jpg \"The greater absorption of thermal energy by dark colors\nresulted in the clothes pattern, in the tight-fitting areas on this survivor,\nbeing burnt into the skin.\")  \n---  \nThe [greater absorption of thermal energy by dark colors](/wiki/Albedo\n\"Albedo\") resulted in the [clothes pattern](/wiki/Kimono \"Kimono\"), in the\ntight-fitting areas on this survivor, being burnt into the skin.  \n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/4866937274_e3e7aff26e_b_Br%C3%BBluresRadiations.jpg/150px-4866937274_e3e7aff26e_b_Br%C3%BBluresRadiations.jpg)](/wiki/File:4866937274_e3e7aff26e_b_Br%C3%BBluresRadiations.jpg\n\"Direct, thermal flash burns.

Nagasaki had\nbeen permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city\nzoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each\nother almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley.\nOn the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki,\nincluding 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500\nconscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese\nworkers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of\nNagasaki.[191][192]\n\n### Bombing of Nagasaki\n\nResponsibility for the timing of the second bombing was delegated to Tibbets.\nScheduled for August 11 against Kokura, the raid was moved earlier by two days\nto avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on August 10.[193]\nThree bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32,\nand F-33 on their exteriors. On August 8, a dress rehearsal was conducted off\nTinian by Sweeney using _[Bockscar](/wiki/Bockscar \"Bockscar\")_ as the drop\nairplane. Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was\ndesignated for the August 9 mission.[194]\n\n**Special Mission 16, Secondary target Nagasaki, August 9, 1945**[195] **Aircraft** | **Pilot** | **Call Sign** | **Mission role**  \n---|---|---|---  \n_[Enola Gay](/wiki/Enola_Gay \"Enola Gay\")_ | Captain George W.

The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical\nto that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as\nweather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for\ninstrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with\nhis weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still\nengaged.[196]\n\n[![A page of typed\ninstructions](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Agnew_StrikeOrderNagasaki.jpg/170px-\nAgnew_StrikeOrderNagasaki.jpg)](/wiki/File:Agnew_StrikeOrderNagasaki.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Agnew_StrikeOrderNagasaki.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nStrike order for the Nagasaki bombing as posted August 8, 1945\n\nDuring pre-flight inspection of _Bockscar_ , the flight engineer notified\nSweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use 640\nUS gallons (2,400 l; 530 imp gal) of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel\nwould still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still\nmore fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another\naircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was\nlive. Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have _Bockscar_ continue the\nmission.[197][198]\n\nThis time Penney and Cheshire were allowed to accompany the mission, flying as\nobservers on the third plane, _[Big Stink](/wiki/Big_Stink_\\(B-29\\) \"Big Stink\n\\(B-29\\)\")_ , flown by the group's operations officer, Major James I. Hopkins,\nJr. Observers aboard the weather planes reported both targets clear. When\nSweeney's aircraft arrived at the assembly point for his flight off the coast\nof Japan, _Big Stink_ failed to make the rendezvous.[196] According to\nCheshire, Hopkins was at varying heights including 9,000 feet (2,700 m) higher\nthan he should have been, and was not flying tight circles over\n[Yakushima](/wiki/Yakushima \"Yakushima\") as previously agreed with Sweeney and\nCaptain [Frederick C. Bock](/wiki/Frederick_C._Bock \"Frederick C. Bock\"), who\nwas piloting the support B-29 _The Great Artiste_. Instead, Hopkins was flying\n40-mile (64 km) dogleg patterns.[199] Though ordered not to circle longer than\nfifteen minutes, Sweeney continued to wait for _Big Stink_ , at the urging of\nAshworth, the plane's weaponeer, who was in command of the mission.[200]\n\nAfter exceeding the original departure time limit by a half-hour, _Bockscar_ ,\naccompanied by _The Great Artiste_ , proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away.\nThe delay at the rendezvous had resulted in clouds and drifting smoke over\nKokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby\n[Yahata](/wiki/Yahata,_Fukuoka \"Yahata, Fukuoka\") the previous day.\nAdditionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned [coal\ntar](/wiki/Coal_tar \"Coal tar\"), to produce black smoke.[201] The clouds and\nsmoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the\naiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel\nand exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the\nbombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run,\nJapanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant [Jacob\nBeser](/wiki/Jacob_Beser \"Jacob Beser\"), who was monitoring Japanese\ncommunications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio\nbands.[202]\n\nAfter three runs over the city, and with fuel running low because of the\nfailed fuel pump, they headed for their secondary target, Nagasaki.[196] Fuel\nconsumption calculations made en route indicated that _Bockscar_ had\ninsufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and would be forced to divert to\n[Okinawa](/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture \"Okinawa Prefecture\"), which had become\nentirely Allied-occupied territory [only six weeks\nearlier](/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa#Southern_Okinawa \"Battle of Okinawa\"). After\ninitially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew\nwould carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary,\nAshworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was\nobscured.[203]\n\nAt about 07:50 Japanese time, an air raid alert was sounded in Nagasaki, but\nthe \"all clear\" signal was given at 08:30. When only two B-29 Superfortresses\nwere sighted at 10:53, the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were\nonly on reconnaissance and no further alarm was given.[204]\n\n[![The before image looks like a city.

These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to\nProfessor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the [University of\nTokyo](/wiki/University_of_Tokyo \"University of Tokyo\") who studied with three\nof the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the [University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley](/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley \"University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley\"), urging him to tell the public about the danger\ninvolved with these [weapons of mass\ndestruction](/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction \"Weapons of mass destruction\").\nThe messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane\nuntil a month later.[205] In 1949, one of the authors of the letter, [Luis\nAlvarez](/wiki/Luis_Walter_Alvarez \"Luis Walter Alvarez\"), met with Sagane and\nsigned the document.[206]\n\nAt 11:01, a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed _Bockscar_\n's bombardier, Captain [Kermit Beahan](/wiki/Kermit_Beahan \"Kermit Beahan\"),\nto visually sight the target as ordered. The Fat Man weapon, containing a core\nof about 6.4 kg (14 lb) of [plutonium](/wiki/Plutonium \"Plutonium\"), was\ndropped over the city's industrial valley at [32°46′25″N 129°51′48″E﻿ /\n﻿32.77372°N 129.86325°E﻿ / 32.77372;\n129.86325](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki&params=32.77372_N_129.86325_E_).\nIt exploded 47 seconds later at 1,650 ± 33 ft (503 ± 10 m), above a tennis\ncourt[207] halfway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south\nand the Nagasaki Arsenal in the north. This was nearly 3 km (1.9 mi) northwest\nof the planned hypocenter; the blast was confined to the [Urakami\nValley](/wiki/Urakami \"Urakami\") and a major portion of the city was protected\nby the intervening hills.[208] The resulting explosion released the equivalent\nenergy of 21 ± 2 kt (87.9 ± 8.4 TJ).[136] The explosion generated temperatures\ninside the fireball estimated at 3,900 °C (7,050\n°F)[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_] and winds that were estimated\nat over 1,000 km/h (620\nmph).[209][210][_[where?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_\\(geographic_names\\)\n\"Wikipedia:Naming conventions \\(geographic names\\)\")_]\n\n_Big Stink_ spotted the explosion from a hundred miles away, and flew over to\nobserve.[211] Because of the delays in the mission and the inoperative fuel\ntransfer pump, _Bockscar_ did not have sufficient fuel to reach the emergency\nlanding field at Iwo Jima, so Sweeney and Bock flew to [Okinawa](/wiki/Okinawa\n\"Okinawa\"). Arriving there, Sweeney circled for 20 minutes trying to contact\nthe control tower for landing clearance, finally concluding that his radio was\nfaulty. Critically low on fuel, _Bockscar_ barely made it to the runway on\nOkinawa's [Yontan Airfield](/wiki/Yontan_Airfield \"Yontan Airfield\"). With\nenough fuel for only one landing attempt, Sweeney and Albury brought\n_Bockscar_ in at 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) instead of the normal 120 miles\nper hour (190 km/h), firing distress flares to alert the field of the\nuncleared landing. The number two engine died from fuel starvation as\n_Bockscar_ began its final approach. Touching the runway hard, the heavy B-29\nslewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed\nto regain control. The B-29's reversible propellers were insufficient to slow\nthe aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes,\n_Bockscar_ made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid\nrunning off it. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion by the time the\nplane came to a stop. The flight engineer later measured fuel in the tanks and\nconcluded that less than five minutes total remained.[212]\n\nFollowing the mission, there was confusion over the identification of the\nplane. The first eyewitness account by war correspondent [William L.\nLaurence](/wiki/William_L._Laurence \"William L. Laurence\") of _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ , who accompanied the\nmission aboard the aircraft piloted by Bock, reported that Sweeney was leading\nthe mission in _The Great Artiste_. He also noted its \"Victor\" number as 77,\nwhich was that of _Bockscar_.[213] Laurence had interviewed Sweeney and his\ncrew, and was aware that they referred to their airplane as _The Great\nArtiste_. Except for _Enola Gay_ , none of the 393d's B-29s had yet had names\npainted on the noses, a fact which Laurence himself noted in his account.\nUnaware of the switch in aircraft, Laurence assumed Victor 77 was _The Great\nArtiste_ ,[214] which was in fact, Victor 89.[215]\n\n### Events on the ground\n\n[![A boy lying down.

Some 17,000–22,000 others who worked in\nother war plants and factories in the city died as well.[217] Casualty\nestimates for immediate deaths vary widely, ranging from 22,000 to 75,000[217]\nAt least 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 others\ninjured.[218][219][220][221] In the days and months following the explosion,\nmore people died from bomb effects. Because of the presence of undocumented\nforeign workers, and a number of military personnel in transit, there are\ngreat discrepancies in the estimates of total deaths by the end of 1945; a\nrange of 39,000 to 80,000 can be found in various studies.[120][221]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/UrakamiTenshudoJan1946.jpg/220px-\nUrakamiTenshudoJan1946.jpg)](/wiki/File:UrakamiTenshudoJan1946.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:UrakamiTenshudoJan1946.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Urakami](/wiki/Urakami \"Urakami\") Tenshudo (Catholic Church in Nagasaki)\ndestroyed by the bomb, the dome/bell of the church, at right, having toppled\noff\n\nUnlike Hiroshima's military death toll, only 150 Japanese soldiers were killed\ninstantly, including thirty-six from the 134th AAA Regiment of the 4th AAA\nDivision.[114][222] At least eight known [POWs](/wiki/Prisoner_of_war\n\"Prisoner of war\") died from the bombing and as many as 13 may have died,\nincluding a British prisoner of war, Royal Air Force Corporal [Ronald\nShaw](/wiki/Ronald_Shaw \"Ronald Shaw\"),[223] and seven Dutch POWs.[224] One\nAmerican POW, [Joe Kieyoomia](/wiki/Joe_Kieyoomia \"Joe Kieyoomia\"), was in\nNagasaki at the time of the bombing but survived, reportedly having been\nshielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell.[225]\nThere were 24 Australian POWs in Nagasaki, all of whom survived.[226]\n\nThe radius of total destruction was about 1 mi (1.6 km), followed by fires\nacross the northern portion of the city to 2 mi (3.2 km) south of the\nbomb.[146][227] About 58% of the Mitsubishi Arms Plant was damaged, and about\n78% of the Mitsubishi Steel Works. The Mitsubishi Electric Works suffered only\n10% structural damage as it was on the border of the main destruction zone.\nThe Nagasaki Arsenal was destroyed in the blast.[228]\n\nAlthough many fires likewise burnt following the bombing, in contrast to\nHiroshima where sufficient [fuel density](/wiki/Firestorm \"Firestorm\") was\navailable, no [firestorm](/wiki/Firestorm \"Firestorm\") developed in Nagasaki\nas the damaged areas did not furnish enough fuel to generate the phenomenon.\nInstead, the ambient wind at the time pushed the fire spread along the\nvalley.[229]\n\n## Plans for more atomic attacks on Japan\n\n[![A pile of rubble surmounted by a statue of\nBuddha](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Nagasaki_temple_destroyed.jpg/220px-\nNagasaki_temple_destroyed.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nagasaki_temple_destroyed.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Nagasaki_temple_destroyed.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Nagasaki Prefecture Report on the bombing characterized Nagasaki as \"like\na graveyard with not a tombstone standing\".[230]\n\nGroves expected to have another atomic bomb ready for use on August 19, with\nthree more in September and a further three in October.[85] On August 10, he\nsent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that \"the next bomb ... should\nbe ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August.\" On\nthe same day, Marshall endorsed the memo with the comment, \"It is not to be\nreleased over Japan without express authority from the President.\"[85] Truman\nhad secretly requested this on August 10. This modified the previous order\nthat the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs \"as made\nready\".[231]\n\nThere was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs\nthen in production for [Operation Downfall](/wiki/Operation_Downfall\n\"Operation Downfall\"). \"The problem now [August 13] is whether or not,\nassuming the Japanese do not capitulate, to continue dropping them every time\none is made and shipped out there or whether to hold them ... and then pour\nthem all on in a reasonably short time. Not all in one day, but over a short\nperiod. And that also takes into consideration the target that we are after.\nIn other words, should we not concentrate on targets that will be of the\ngreatest assistance to an invasion rather than industry, morale, psychology,\nand the like? Nearer the tactical use rather than other use.\"[85]\n\nTwo more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave [Kirtland\nField](/wiki/Kirtland_Air_Force_Base \"Kirtland Air Force Base\") for Tinian on\nAugust 11 and 14,[232] and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay to return to\n[Albuquerque, New Mexico](/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico \"Albuquerque, New\nMexico\"), to collect them.[233] At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours\nstraight to cast [another plutonium core](/wiki/Demon_core \"Demon core\").[234]\nAlthough cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take\nuntil August 16.[235] Therefore, it could have been ready for use on August\n19. Unable to reach Marshall, Groves ordered on his own authority on August 13\nthat the core should not be shipped.[231]\n\n## Surrender of Japan and subsequent occupation\n\nMain articles: [Surrender of Japan](/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan \"Surrender of\nJapan\") and [Occupation of Japan](/wiki/Occupation_of_Japan \"Occupation of\nJapan\")\n\nUntil August 9, Japan's war council still insisted on its four conditions for\nsurrender. On that day Hirohito ordered [Kōichi Kido](/wiki/K%C5%8Dichi_Kido\n\"Kōichi Kido\") to \"quickly control the situation ... because the Soviet Union\nhas declared war against us.\" He then held an Imperial conference during which\nhe authorized minister [Shigenori Tōgō](/wiki/Shigenori_T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D\n\"Shigenori Tōgō\") to notify the Allies that Japan would accept their terms on\none condition, that the declaration \"does not comprise any demand which\nprejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign ruler.\"[236]\n\nOn August 12, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to\nsurrender. One of his uncles, [Prince Asaka](/wiki/Prince_Yasuhiko_Asaka\n\"Prince Yasuhiko Asaka\"), then asked whether the war would be continued if the\n_kokutai_ could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied, \"Of course.\"[237]\nAs the Allied terms seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation\nof the Throne, Hirohito recorded on August 14 his [capitulation\nannouncement](/wiki/Gyokuon-h%C5%8Ds%C5%8D \"Gyokuon-hōsō\") which was broadcast\nto the Japanese nation the next day despite a short\n[rebellion](/wiki/Ky%C5%ABj%C5%8D_Incident \"Kyūjō Incident\") by militarists\nopposed to the surrender.[238]\n\nIn his declaration, Hirohito referred to the atomic bombings:\n\n> Moreover, the enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power\n> to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage. Should we\n> continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and\n> obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total\n> extinction of human civilization.\n>\n> Such being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, or to\n> atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? This\n> is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the\n> joint declaration of the powers.[239]\n\nIn his \"Rescript to the Soldiers and Sailors\" delivered on August 17, he\nstressed the impact of the Soviet invasion on his decision to surrender.[240]\nHirohito met with General MacArthur on September 27, saying to him that \"the\npeace party did not prevail until the bombing of Hiroshima created a situation\nwhich could be dramatized\". Furthermore, the \"Rescript to the Soldiers and\nSailors\" speech he told MacArthur about was just personal, not political, and\nnever stated that the Soviet intervention in Manchuria was the main reason for\nsurrender. In fact, a day after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet\ninvasion of Manchuria, Hirohito ordered his advisers, primarily [Chief Cabinet\nSecretary](/wiki/Chief_Cabinet_Secretary \"Chief Cabinet Secretary\") [Hisatsune\nSakomizu](/wiki/Hisatsune_Sakomizu \"Hisatsune Sakomizu\"), Kawada Mizuho, and\n[Masahiro Yasuoka](/wiki/Masahiro_Yasuoka \"Masahiro Yasuoka\"), to write up a\nsurrender speech. In Hirohito's speech, days before announcing it on radio on\nAugust 15, he gave three major reasons for surrender: Tokyo's defenses would\nnot be complete before the American invasion of Japan, [Ise\nShrine](/wiki/Ise_Shrine \"Ise Shrine\") would be lost to the Americans, and\natomic weapons deployed by the Americans would lead to the death of the entire\nJapanese race. Despite the Soviet intervention, Hirohito did not mention the\nSoviets as the main factor for surrender.[241]\n\n## Depiction, public response, and censorship\n\n![File:Hiroshima Aftermath 1946 USAF\nFilm.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Hiroshima_Aftermath_1946_USAF_Film.ogv/220px-\nseek%3D330-Hiroshima_Aftermath_1946_USAF_Film.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Hiroshima_Aftermath_1946_USAF_Film.ogv\n\"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hiroshima_Aftermath_1946_USAF_Film.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\nLife among the rubble in Hiroshima in March and April 1946.

Hahn stated that he had not believed an atomic weapon\n\"would be possible for another twenty years\"; [Werner\nHeisenberg](/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg \"Werner Heisenberg\") did not believe the\nnews at first. [Carl Friedrich von\nWeizsäcker](/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_von_Weizs%C3%A4cker \"Carl Friedrich von\nWeizsäcker\") said \"I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it. I\nthink it is madness on their part\", but Heisenberg replied, \"One could equally\nwell say 'That's the quickest way of ending the war'\".

His [Morse code](/wiki/Morse_code \"Morse code\")\ndispatch was printed by the _[Daily Express](/wiki/Daily_Express \"Daily\nExpress\")_ newspaper in London on September 5, 1945, entitled \"The Atomic\nPlague\", the first public report to mention the effects of\n[radiation](/wiki/Radiation \"Radiation\") and [nuclear\nfallout](/wiki/Nuclear_fallout \"Nuclear fallout\").[254] Burchett's reporting\nwas unpopular with the U.S. military. The U.S. censors suppressed a supporting\nstory submitted by [George Weller](/wiki/George_Weller \"George Weller\") of the\n_[Chicago Daily News](/wiki/Chicago_Daily_News \"Chicago Daily News\")_ , and\naccused Burchett of being under the sway of Japanese propaganda.

McGovern and Harry\nMimura\n\nA member of the U.S. [Strategic Bombing Survey](/wiki/Strategic_Bombing_Survey\n\"Strategic Bombing Survey\"), Lieutenant Daniel McGovern, used a film crew to\ndocument the results in early 1946.[256] The film crew's work resulted in a\nthree-hour documentary entitled _The Effects of the Atomic Bombs Against\nHiroshima and Nagasaki_. The documentary included images from hospitals\nshowing the human effects of the bomb; it showed burned out buildings and\ncars, and rows of skulls and bones on the ground. It was classified \"secret\"\nfor the next 22 years.[257] During this time in America, it was a common\npractice for editors to keep graphic images of death out of films, magazines,\nand newspapers.[252] The total of 90,000 ft (27,000 m) of film shot by\nMcGovern's cameramen had not been fully aired as of 2009. According to [Greg\nMitchell](/wiki/Greg_Mitchell \"Greg Mitchell\"), with the 2004 documentary film\n_[Original Child Bomb](/wiki/Original_Child_Bomb \"Original Child Bomb\")_ , a\nsmall part of that footage managed to reach part of the American public \"in\nthe unflinching and powerful form its creators intended\".[256]\n\nMotion picture company Nippon Eigasha started sending cameramen to Nagasaki\nand Hiroshima in September 1945. On October 24, 1945, a [U.S. military\npoliceman](/wiki/Military_Police_Corps_\\(United_States\\) \"Military Police\nCorps \\(United States\\)\") stopped a Nippon Eigasha cameraman from continuing\nto film in Nagasaki. All Nippon Eigasha's reels were then confiscated by the\nAmerican authorities. These reels were in turn requested by the Japanese\ngovernment, declassified, and saved from oblivion. Some black-and-white motion\npictures were released and shown for the first time to Japanese and American\naudiences in the years from 1968 to 1970.[256] The public release of film\nfootage of the city post-attack, and some research about the human effects of\nthe attack, was restricted during the [occupation of\nJapan](/wiki/Occupied_Japan \"Occupied Japan\"), and much of this information\nwas censored until the signing of the [San Francisco Peace\nTreaty](/wiki/San_Francisco_Peace_Treaty \"San Francisco Peace Treaty\") in\n1951, restoring control to the Japanese.[258]\n\nOnly the most politically charged and detailed [weapons effects\ninformation](/wiki/Effects_of_nuclear_weapons \"Effects of nuclear weapons\")\nwas censored during this period. The Hiroshima-based magazine, _Chugoku Bunka_\nfor example, in its first issue published March 10, 1946, devotes itself to\ndetailing the damage from the bombing.[259] Similarly, there was no censorship\nof the factually written witness accounts, the book\n_[Hiroshima](/wiki/Hiroshima_\\(book\\) \"Hiroshima \\(book\\)\")_ written by\n[Pulitzer Prize](/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize \"Pulitzer Prize\") winner [John\nHersey](/wiki/John_Hersey \"John Hersey\"), which was originally published in\narticle form in the popular magazine _[The New Yorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker\n\"The New Yorker\")_ ,[260] on August 31, 1946, is reported to have reached\nTokyo in English by January 1947, and the translated version was released in\nJapan in 1949.[261][262][263] The book narrates the stories of the lives of\nsix bomb survivors from immediately prior to, and months after, the dropping\nof the Little Boy bomb.[260] Beginning in 1974 a compilation of drawings and\nartwork made by the survivors of the bombings began to be compiled, with\ncompletion in 1977 and under both book and exhibition format, it was titled\n_The Unforgettable Fire_.[264]\n\n## Post-attack casualties\n\nSee also: [Epidemiology data for low-linear energy transfer\nradiation](/wiki/Epidemiology_data_for_low-linear_energy_transfer_radiation\n\"Epidemiology data for low-linear energy transfer radiation\")\n\n![File:Medical aspect, Hiroshima, Japan, 1946-03-23,\n342-USAF-11034.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Medical_aspect%2C_Hiroshima%2C_Japan%2C_1946-03-23%2C_342-USAF-11034.ogv/220px-\nseek%3D152-Medical_aspect%2C_Hiroshima%2C_Japan%2C_1946-03-23%2C_342-USAF-11034.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Medical_aspect%2C_Hiroshima%2C_Japan%2C_1946-03-23%2C_342-USAF-11034.ogv\n\"Play media\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Medical_aspect,_Hiroshima,_Japan,_1946-03-23,_342-USAF-11034.ogv\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nSilent film footage taken in Hiroshima in March 1946 showing survivors with\nsevere burns and [keloid](/wiki/Keloid \"Keloid\") scars.

Neel](/wiki/James_V._Neel \"James V.\nNeel\") led the study which found that the number of [birth\ndefects](/wiki/Birth_defects \"Birth defects\") was not significantly higher\namong the children of survivors who were pregnant at the time of the\nbombings.[267] Neel also studied the longevity of the children who survived\nthe bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, reporting that between 90 and 95\npercent were still living 50 years later.[268]\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences questioned Neel's procedure which did not\nfilter the Kure population for possible radiation exposure.[269] Overall,\nwhile a [statistically insignificant](/wiki/Statistical_significance\n\"Statistical significance\") increase in birth defects occurred directly after\nthe bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Neel and others noted that in\napproximately 50 humans who were of an early [gestational\nage](/wiki/Gestational_age \"Gestational age\") at the time of the bombing and\nwho were all within about 1 km from the hypocenter, an increase in\n[microencephaly](/wiki/Microencephaly \"Microencephaly\") and\n[anencephaly](/wiki/Anencephaly \"Anencephaly\") was observed upon birth, with\nthe incidence of these two particular malformations being nearly 3 times what\nwas to be expected when compared to the [control group](/wiki/Control_group\n\"Control group\") in Kure.[270][271]\n\nIn 1985, [Johns Hopkins University](/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University \"Johns\nHopkins University\") human geneticist [James F. Crow](/wiki/James_F._Crow\n\"James F. Crow\") examined Neel's research and confirmed that the number of\nbirth defects was not significantly higher in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[272]\nMany members of the ABCC and its successor [Radiation Effects Research\nFoundation](/wiki/Radiation_Effects_Research_Foundation \"Radiation Effects\nResearch Foundation\") (RERF) were still looking for possible birth defects or\nother causes among the survivors decades later, but found no evidence that\nthey were more common among the survivors.[268][273] Despite the\ninsignificance of birth defects found in Neel's study and the detailed medical\nliterature, up to 1987, historians such as [Ronald E.\nPowaski](/wiki/Ronald_E._Powaski \"Ronald E. Powaski\") frequently wrote that\nHiroshima experienced \"an increase in stillbirths, birth defects, and infant\nmortality\" following the atomic bomb.[274]\n\nAs [cancers do not immediately emerge after exposure to\nradiation](/wiki/Radiation-induced_cancer \"Radiation-induced cancer\") instead\nradiation-induced cancer has a minimum [latency period](/wiki/Radiation-\ninduced_cancer \"Radiation-induced cancer\") of some 5+ years. An\n[epidemiology](/wiki/Epidemiology \"Epidemiology\") study by the RERF estimates\nthat from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers of\nunspecificed lethality, could be due to radiation from the bombs, with the\nstatistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of\nundeclared lethality. Both of these statistics being derived from the\nobservation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those who\ntook part in the study.[275]\n\n## _Hibakusha_\n\nMain article: [Hibakusha](/wiki/Hibakusha \"Hibakusha\")\n\nSee also: [Hibakujumoku](/wiki/Hibakujumoku \"Hibakujumoku\")\n\nThe survivors of the bombings are called _[hibakusha](/wiki/Hibakusha\n\"Hibakusha\")_ (被爆者, Japanese pronunciation:\n[[çibakɯ̥ɕa]](/wiki/Help:IPA/Japanese \"Help:IPA/Japanese\")), a Japanese word\nthat literally translates to \"explosion-affected people\". The Japanese\ngovernment has recognized about 650,000 people as _hibakusha_. As of March 31,\n2017[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki&action=edit),\n164,621 are still alive, mostly in Japan.[276] The government of Japan\nrecognizes about 1% of these as having illnesses caused by radiation.[277] The\nmemorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain lists of the names of the\n_hibakusha_ who are known to have died since the bombings. Updated annually on\nthe anniversaries of the bombings, as of August\n2017[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki&action=edit)\nthe memorials record the names of almost 485,000 _hibakusha_ ; 308,725 in\nHiroshima[278] and 175,743 in Nagasaki.[279]\n\n[![A rectangular column rises above a dark stone base with Japanese writing on\nit.

He was confirmed to be 3 km (1.9 mi) from ground zero in\nHiroshima on a business trip when Little Boy was detonated. He was seriously\nburnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He arrived at his\nhome city of Nagasaki on August 8, the day before Fat Man was dropped, and he\nwas exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was\nthe first officially recognized survivor of both bombings.[283] He died on\nJanuary 4, 2010, at the age of 93, after a battle with stomach cancer.[284]\n\nThe 2006 documentary _Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki_ documented 165 _nijū hibakusha (lit. double explosion-affected\npeople)_ , and was screened at the United Nations.[285]\n\n### Korean survivors\n\nSee also: [Anti-Korean sentiment § Japan](/wiki/Anti-Korean_sentiment#Japan\n\"Anti-Korean sentiment\")\n\nDuring the war, Japan brought as many as 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to\nwork as [forced labor](/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#Forced_labor \"Japanese war\ncrimes\").[286] About 5,000–8,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and another\n1,500–2,000 died in Nagasaki.[287] For many years, Korean survivors had a\ndifficult time fighting for the same recognition as _Hibakusha_ as afforded to\nall Japanese survivors, a situation which resulted in the denial of the free\nhealth benefits to them. Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through\nlawsuits.[288]\n\n## Debate over bombings\n\nMain article: [Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and\nNagasaki](/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki\n\"Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\")\n\n[![A shot along a river.

J. Samuel Walker\nwrote in an April 2005 overview of recent historiography on the issue, \"the\ncontroversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue.\" He wrote that\n\"The fundamental issue that has divided scholars over a period of nearly four\ndecades is whether the use of the bomb was necessary to achieve victory in the\nwar in the Pacific on terms satisfactory to the United States.\"[289]\n\nSupporters of the bombings generally assert that they caused the Japanese\nsurrender, preventing casualties on both sides during Operation Downfall. One\nfigure of speech, \"One hundred million [subjects of the Japanese Empire] will\ndie for the Emperor and Nation\",[290] served as a unifying slogan, although\nthat phrase was intended as a figure of speech along the lines of the \"[ten\nthousand years](/wiki/Ten_thousand_years \"Ten thousand years\")\" phrase.[6] In\nTruman's 1955 _Memoirs_ , \"he states that the atomic bomb probably saved half\na million U.S. lives—anticipated casualties in an Allied invasion of Japan\nplanned for November. Stimson subsequently talked of saving one million U.S.\ncasualties, and Churchill of saving one million American and half that number\nof British lives.\"[291] Scholars have pointed out various alternatives that\ncould have ended the war without an invasion, but these alternatives could\nhave resulted in the deaths of many more Japanese.[292] Supporters also point\nto an order given by the Japanese War Ministry on August 1, 1944, ordering the\nexecution of Allied prisoners of war when the POW camp was in the combat\nzone.[293]\n\nThose who oppose the bombings cite a number of reasons for their view, among\nthem: a belief that atomic bombing is fundamentally immoral, that the bombings\ncounted as [war crimes](/wiki/War_crime \"War crime\"), that they were\nmilitarily unnecessary, that they constituted state terrorism,[294] and that\nthey involved racism against and the dehumanization of the Japanese\npeople.[295] The bombings were part of an already fierce conventional bombing\ncampaign. This, together with the naval blockade, could also have eventually\nled to a Japanese surrender. At the time the United States dropped its atomic\nbomb on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, the [Soviet Union launched a surprise\nattack](/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria \"Soviet invasion of Manchuria\")\nwith 1.6 million troops against the Kwantung Army in\n[Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria \"Manchuria\"). \"The Soviet entry into the war\",\nargued Japanese historian [Tsuyoshi Hasegawa](/wiki/Tsuyoshi_Hasegawa\n\"Tsuyoshi Hasegawa\"), \"played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in\ninducing Japan to surrender because it dashed any hope that Japan could\nterminate the war through Moscow's mediation\".[296]\n\nAnother popular view among critics of the bombings, originating with [Gar\nAlperovitz](/wiki/Gar_Alperovitz \"Gar Alperovitz\") in 1965 and becoming the\ndefault position in Japanese school history textbooks, is the idea of atomic\ndiplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons in order to intimidate\nthe Soviet Union in the early stages of the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold\nWar\").[297]\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Giangreco 2009, pp. 2–3, 49–51.\n  2. **Jump up ^** Williams 1960, p. 307.\n  3. **Jump up ^** Williams 1960, p. 532.\n  4. **Jump up ^** Williams 1960, p. 527.\n  5. **Jump up ^** Long 1963, pp. 48–49.\n  6. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Brooks & Stanley 2007, pp. 41–44.\n  7. **Jump up ^** Coox 1969, pp. 2540–2544.\n  8. **Jump up ^** Giangreco 2009, pp. 32–34.\n  9. **Jump up ^** Giangreco 2009, pp. 125–130.\n  10. **Jump up ^** Giangreco 2009, pp. 169–171.\n  11. **Jump up ^** Giangreco 2009, pp. 45–48.\n  12. **Jump up ^** Giangreco 2009, p. 21.\n  13. **Jump up ^** Giangreco 2009, pp. 70–72.\n  14. **Jump up ^** Giangreco 2009, pp. 121–124.\n  15. **Jump up ^** [\"The Final Months of the War With Japan.

Retrieved March 9, 2014. describes how various values were recorded for the B-29's altitude at the moment of bomb release over Hiroshima. The strike report said 30,200 ft, the official history said 31,600 ft, Commander Parson's log entry was 32,700 ft, and the navigator's log was 31,060 ft—the latter possibly an error transposing two digits. A later calculation using the indicated atmospheric pressure arrived at the figure of 32,200 ft.  \nSimilarly, several values have been reported as the altitude of the Little Boy\nbomb at the moment of detonation. Published sources vary in the range of 1,800\nto 2,000 ft (550 to 610 m) above the city. The device was set to explode at\n1,885 ft (575 m), but this was approximate. Malik uses the figure of 1,903 ft\n(580 m) plus or minus 50 ft (15 m), determined after data review by Hubbell et\nal 1969. Radar returns from the tops of multistory buildings near the\nhypocenter may have triggered the detonation at a somewhat higher altitude\nthan planned. Kerr et al. (2005) found that a detonation altitude of 600 m\n(1,968.5 ft), plus or minus 20 m (65.6 ft), gave the best fit for all the\nmeasurement discrepancies.\n\n  138. **Jump up ^** [\"The Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima, Aug 6, 1945\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20100624065430/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/hiroshima.htm).
