The so-called \"whiskey tax\" was the first tax imposed on a\ndomestic product by the newly formed federal government. It became law in\n1791, and was intended to generate revenue for the war debt incurred during\nthe [Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American\nRevolutionary War\"). The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but [American\nwhiskey](/wiki/American_whiskey \"American whiskey\") was by far the country's\nmost popular distilled beverage in the 18th century, so the excise became\nwidely known as a \"whiskey tax\". Farmers of the western frontier were\naccustomed to distilling their surplus [rye](/wiki/Rye \"Rye\"),\n[barley](/wiki/Barley \"Barley\"), [wheat](/wiki/Wheat \"Wheat\"),\n[corn](/wiki/Maize \"Maize\"), or fermented [grain\nmixtures](/wiki/Mash_ingredients \"Mash ingredients\") into whiskey. These\nfarmers resisted the tax. In these regions, whiskey often served as a [medium\nof exchange](/wiki/Medium_of_exchange \"Medium of exchange\"). Many of the\nresisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the\nprinciples of the [American Revolution](/wiki/American_Revolution \"American\nRevolution\"), in particular against [taxation without local\nrepresentation](/wiki/Taxation_without_representation \"Taxation without\nrepresentation\"), while the [federal\ngovernment](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States \"Federal government\nof the United States\") maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of\n[Congressional](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\")\ntaxation powers.\n\nThroughout [Western Pennsylvania](/wiki/Western_Pennsylvania \"Western\nPennsylvania\") counties, protesters used violence and intimidation to prevent\nfederal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance came to a climax in July\n1794, when a [U.S. marshal](/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service \"United\nStates Marshals Service\") arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve\n[writs](/wiki/Writs \"Writs\") to distillers who had not paid the excise. The\nalarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of\ntax inspector [General John Neville](/wiki/John_Neville_\\(general\\) \"John\nNeville \\(general\\)\"). Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to\nwestern Pennsylvania to negotiate with the rebels, while at the same time\ncalling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington\nhimself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000\nmilitiamen provided by the [governors](/wiki/Governor_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Governor \\(United States\\)\") of [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\"),\n[Maryland](/wiki/Maryland \"Maryland\"), [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey \"New\nJersey\"), and [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"). The rebels\nall went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation.\nAbout 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned. Most\ndistillers in nearby Kentucky were found to be all but impossible to tax—in\nthe next six years, over 175 distillers from Kentucky were convicted of\nviolating the tax law.[3] Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in\ncourt documents and newspaper accounts.[4]\n\nThe Whiskey Rebellion demonstrated that the new national government had the\nwill and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws, though the\nwhiskey excise remained difficult to collect. The events contributed to the\nformation of political parties in the United States, a process already\nunderway. The whiskey tax was repealed in the early 1800s during the\n[Jefferson administration](/wiki/Presidency_of_Thomas_Jefferson \"Presidency of\nThomas Jefferson\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Whiskey tax\n  * 2 Western grievances\n  * 3 Resistance\n  * 4 Insurrection\n    * 4.1 Battle of Bower Hill\n    * 4.2 March on Pittsburgh\n    * 4.3 Meeting at Whiskey Point\n    * 4.4 Federal response\n      * 4.4.1 Negotiations\n      * 4.4.2 Militia expedition\n    * 4.5 Aftermath\n  * 5 Legacy\n    * 5.1 In popular culture\n  * 6 Research materials\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 Notes\n  * 9 Bibliography\n  * 10 Further reading\n  * 11 External links\n\n## Whiskey tax\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Alexander_Hamilton.jpg/220px-\nAlexander_Hamilton.jpg)](/wiki/File:Alexander_Hamilton.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Alexander_Hamilton.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\") in a 1792\nportrait by [John Trumbull](/wiki/John_Trumbull \"John Trumbull\")\n\nA new [U.S. federal government](/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States\n\"Federal government of the United States\") began operating in 1789, following\nthe ratification of the [United States\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\").\nThe previous central government under the [Articles of\nConfederation](/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation \"Articles of Confederation\")\nhad been unable to levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund\nthe [Revolution](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary\nWar\"), accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an\nadditional $25 million in debt.[5] [Secretary of the\nTreasury](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury \"United States\nSecretary of the Treasury\") [Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton\n\"Alexander Hamilton\") sought to use this debt to create a financial system\nthat would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his _[Report on\nPublic Credit](/wiki/Report_on_Public_Credit \"Report on Public Credit\")_ , he\nurged [Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") to\nconsolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be\nfunded by the federal government. Congress approved these measures in June and\nJuly 1790.[6]\n\nA source of government revenue was needed to pay the respectable amount due to\nthe previous [bondholders](/wiki/Bond_\\(finance\\) \"Bond \\(finance\\)\") to whom\nthe debt was owed. By December 1790, Hamilton believed that import duties,\nwhich were the government's primary source of revenue, had been raised as high\nas feasible.[7] He therefore promoted passage of an [excise](/wiki/Excise\n\"Excise\") tax on domestically produced [distilled\nspirits](/wiki/Distilled_beverage \"Distilled beverage\"). This was to be the\nfirst tax levied by the national government on a domestic product.[8] Whiskey\nwas by far the most popular distilled beverage in late 18th-century America,\nso the excise became known as the \"whiskey tax.\" Taxes were politically\nunpopular, and Hamilton believed that the whiskey excise was a [luxury\ntax](/wiki/Luxury_tax \"Luxury tax\") and would be the least objectionable tax\nthat the government could levy.[9] In this, he had the support of some social\nreformers, who hoped that a \"[sin tax](/wiki/Sin_tax \"Sin tax\")\" would raise\npublic awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol.[10] The whiskey excise\nact, sometimes known as the \"Whiskey Act\", became law in March 1791.[11]\nGeorge Washington defined the revenue districts, appointed the revenue\nsupervisors and inspectors, and set their pay in November 1791.[12]\n\n## Western grievances\n\nThe population of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790.[13] Among the\nfarmers in the region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with\nmany people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners.[14]\nWhiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by\noperating small [stills](/wiki/Still \"Still\").[15] Farmers living west of the\n[Appalachian Mountains](/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains \"Appalachian Mountains\")\ndistilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more\nprofitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A\nwhiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain\nproducers.[16] Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier,\nso whiskey often served as a [medium of exchange](/wiki/Medium_of_exchange\n\"Medium of exchange\"). For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the excise\nwas essentially an [income tax](/wiki/Income_tax \"Income tax\") that wealthier\neasterners did not pay.[17]\n\nSmall-scale farmers also protested that Hamilton's excise effectively gave\nunfair tax breaks to large distillers, most of whom were based in the east.\nThere were two methods of paying the whiskey excise: paying a flat fee or\npaying by the gallon. Large distillers produced whiskey in volume and could\nafford the flat fee. The more efficient they became, the less tax per gallon\nthey would pay (as low as 6 [cents](/wiki/Cent_\\(currency\\) \"Cent\n\\(currency\\)\"), according to Hamilton). Western farmers who owned small stills\ndid not usually operate them year-round at full capacity, so they ended up\npaying a higher tax per gallon (9 cents), which made them less\ncompetitive.[18] The [regressive](/wiki/Regressive_taxation \"Regressive\ntaxation\") nature of the tax was further compounded by an additional factor:\nwhiskey sold for considerably less on the cash-poor Western frontier than in\nthe wealthier and more populous East. This meant that, even if all distillers\nhad been required to pay the same amount of tax per gallon, the small-scale\nfrontier distillers would still have to remit a considerably larger proportion\nof their product's value than larger Eastern distillers. Small-scale\ndistillers believed that Hamilton deliberately designed the tax to ruin them\nand promote big business, a view endorsed by some historians.[19] However,\nhistorian Thomas Slaughter argued that a \"conspiracy of this sort is difficult\nto document\".[20] Whether by design or not, large distillers recognized the\nadvantage that the excise gave them and they supported it.[21]\n\nOther aspects of the excise law also caused concern. The law required all\nstills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to\nappear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal\ncourthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 miles away from the small frontier\nsettlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had\nlittle success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small\nwestern distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and\nlocal residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax\nrebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those\nwho offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties\nnever had a resident Federal tax official.[22]\n\nIn addition to the whiskey tax, westerners had a number of other grievances\nwith the national government, chief among which was the perception that the\ngovernment was not adequately protecting the residents living in western\nfrontier.[22] The [Northwest Indian War](/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War \"Northwest\nIndian War\") was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791.\nFurthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned\n[Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana_\\(New_Spain\\) \"Louisiana \\(New Spain\\)\")) from\nusing the [Mississippi River](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\") for\ncommercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that\nthe government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the\nwhiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the\nfrontier.[23]\n\n## Resistance\n\nMany residents of the western frontier petitioned against passage of the\nwhiskey excise. When that failed, some [western\nPennsylvanians](/wiki/Western_Pennsylvania \"Western Pennsylvania\") organized\nextralegal conventions to advocate repeal of the law.[24] Opposition to the\ntax was particularly prevalent in four southwestern counties:\n[Allegheny](/wiki/Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania \"Allegheny County,\nPennsylvania\"), [Fayette](/wiki/Fayette_County,_Pennsylvania \"Fayette County,\nPennsylvania\"), [Washington](/wiki/Washington_County,_Pennsylvania \"Washington\nCounty, Pennsylvania\"), and\n[Westmoreland](/wiki/Westmoreland_County,_Pennsylvania \"Westmoreland County,\nPennsylvania\").[25] A preliminary meeting held on July 27, 1791 at [Redstone\nOld Fort](/wiki/Redstone_Old_Fort \"Redstone Old Fort\") in Fayette County\ncalled for the selection of delegates to a more formal assembly, which\nconvened in Pittsburgh in early September 1791. The Pittsburgh convention was\ndominated by moderates such as [Hugh Henry\nBrackenridge](/wiki/Hugh_Henry_Brackenridge \"Hugh Henry Brackenridge\"), who\nhoped to prevent the outbreak of violence.[26] The convention sent a petition\nfor redress of grievances to the [Pennsylvania\nAssembly](/wiki/Pennsylvania_Assembly \"Pennsylvania Assembly\") and the [U.S\nHouse of Representatives](/wiki/U.S_House_of_Representatives \"U.S House of\nRepresentatives\"), both located in [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia\n\"Philadelphia\").[27] As a result of this and other petitions, the excise law\nwas modified in May 1792. Changes included a 1-cent reduction in the tax that\nwas advocated by [William Findley](/wiki/William_Findley \"William Findley\"), a\ncongressman from western Pennsylvania, but the new excise law was still\nunsatisfactory to many westerners.[28]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Whiskey_Insurrection.JPG/300px-\nWhiskey_Insurrection.JPG)](/wiki/File:Whiskey_Insurrection.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Whiskey_Insurrection.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Famous Whiskey Insurrection in Pennsylvania\", an 1880 illustration of a\n[tarred and feathered](/wiki/Tarring_and_feathering \"Tarring and feathering\")\ntax collector being made to [ride the rail](/wiki/Riding_a_rail \"Riding a\nrail\")\n\nAppeals to nonviolent resistance were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, a\nrecently appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was [tarred and\nfeathered](/wiki/Tarring_and_feathering \"Tarring and feathering\") by a\ndisguised gang in Washington County.[29] A man sent by officials to serve\ncourt warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered.[30]\nBecause of these and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791\nand early 1792.[31] The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the\n[American Revolution](/wiki/American_Revolution \"American Revolution\").\nSupporters of the excise argued that there was a difference between [taxation\nwithout representation](/wiki/Taxation_without_representation \"Taxation\nwithout representation\") in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected\nrepresentatives of the American people.[32]\n\nOlder accounts of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to\nwestern Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the\nwestern counties of every other state in [Appalachia](/wiki/Appalachia\n\"Appalachia\") (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and\nGeorgia).[33] The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state\nof Kentucky, where no one could be convinced to enforce the law or prosecute\nevaders.[34][35] In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress\nviolent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General [Edmund\nRandolph](/wiki/Edmund_Randolph \"Edmund Randolph\") argued that there was\ninsufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.[36]\n\nIn August 1792, a second convention was held in Pittsburgh to discuss\nresistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first\nconvention; moderates such as Brackenridge and Findley were not in attendance.\nFuture [Secretary of the Treasury](/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury \"Secretary\nof the Treasury\") [Albert Gallatin](/wiki/Albert_Gallatin \"Albert Gallatin\")\nwas one moderate who did attend, to his later regret.[37] A militant group\nknown as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued\nradical demands. As some of them had done in the American Revolution, they\nraised [liberty poles](/wiki/Liberty_pole \"Liberty pole\"), formed [committees\nof correspondence](/wiki/Committee_of_correspondence \"Committee of\ncorrespondence\"), and took control of the local militia. They created an\nextralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and\nforeclosures.[38]\n\nHamilton regarded the second Pittsburgh convention as a serious threat to the\noperation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent\nPennsylvania tax official [George Clymer](/wiki/George_Clymer \"George Clymer\")\nto western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a\nclumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local\nofficials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions\nmade by the Washington administration.[39] Washington and Hamilton viewed\nresistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since\nthe national capital was then located in the same state. On his own\ninitiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance\nto the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned\ndown some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15,\n1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.[40]\n\nFederal tax inspector for western Pennsylvania [General John\nNeville](/wiki/John_Neville_\\(general\\) \"John Neville \\(general\\)\") was\ndetermined to enforce the excise law.[41] He was a prominent politician and\nwealthy planter—and also a large-scale distiller. He had initially opposed the\nwhiskey tax, but subsequently changed his mind, a reversal that angered some\nwestern Pennsylvanians.[42] In August 1792, Neville rented a room in\nPittsburgh for his tax office, but the landlord turned him out after being\nthreatened with violence by the Mingo Creek Association.[43] From this point\non, tax collectors were not the only people targeted in Pennsylvania; those\nwho cooperated with federal tax officials also faced harassment. Anonymous\nnotes and newspaper articles signed by \"Tom the\n[Tinker](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tinker \"wikt:tinker\")\" threatened\nthose who complied with the whiskey tax.[44] Those who failed to heed the\nwarnings might have their barns burned or their stills destroyed.[45]\n\nResistance to the excise tax continued through 1793 in the frontier counties\nof Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western\nPennsylvania.[46] In June, Neville was [burned in\neffigy](/wiki/Burned_in_effigy \"Burned in effigy\") by a crowd of about 100\npeople in Washington County.[47] On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke\ninto the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was,\nlike Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region.[48] At gunpoint, the\nintruders forced him to surrender his commission.[46] President Washington\noffered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.[49]\n\n## Insurrection\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/William_Findley.jpg/220px-\nWilliam_Findley.jpg)](/wiki/File:William_Findley.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:William_Findley.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nIn his 1796 book, Congressman [William Findley](/wiki/William_Findley \"William\nFindley\") argued that Alexander Hamilton had deliberately provoked the Whiskey\nRebellion.\n\nThe resistance came to a climax in 1794. In May of that year, federal district\nattorney [William Rawle](/wiki/William_Rawle \"William Rawle\") issued\n[subpoenas](/wiki/Subpoena \"Subpoena\") for more than 60 distillers in\nPennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax.[50] Under the law then in\neffect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to\nPhiladelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier,\nsuch a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means.[51] At\nthe urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794,\nallowing excise trials to be held in local state courts.[52] But by that time,\n[U.S. marshal](/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service \"United States Marshals\nService\") David Lenox had already been sent to\n[serve](/wiki/Service_of_process \"Service of process\") the writs summoning\ndelinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General [William\nBradford](/wiki/William_Bradford_\\(Attorney_General\\) \"William Bradford\n\\(Attorney General\\)\") later maintained that the writs were meant to compel\ncompliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to\nhold trials in Philadelphia.[53]\n\nThe timing of these events later proved to be controversial. Findley was a\nbitter political foe of Hamilton, and he maintained in his book on the\ninsurrection that the treasury secretary had deliberately provoked the\nuprising by issuing the subpoenas just before the law was made less\nonerous.[54] In 1963, historian Jacob Cooke, an editor of Hamilton's papers,\nregarded this charge as \"preposterous\", calling it a \"[conspiracy\nthesis](/wiki/Conspiracy_theory \"Conspiracy theory\")\" that overstated\nHamilton's control of the federal government.[55] In 1986, historian Thomas\nSlaughter argued that the outbreak of the insurrection at this moment was due\nto \"a string of ironic coincidences\", although \"the question about motives\nmust always remain\".[56] In 2006, William Hogeland argued that Hamilton,\nBradford, and Rawle intentionally pursued a course of action that would\nprovoke \"the kind of violence that would justify federal military\nsuppression\".[57] According to Hogeland, Hamilton had been working towards\nthis moment since the [Newburgh Crisis](/wiki/Newburgh_Crisis \"Newburgh\nCrisis\") in 1783, where he conceived of using military force to crush popular\nresistance to direct taxation for the purpose of promoting national unity and\nenriching the creditor class at the expense of common taxpayers.[58] Historian\n[S. E. Morison](/wiki/Samuel_Eliot_Morison \"Samuel Eliot Morison\") believed\nthat Hamilton, in general, wished to enforce the excise law \"more as a measure\nof social discipline than as a source of revenue\".[59]\n\n### Battle of Bower Hill\n\nFederal Marshal Lenox delivered most of the writs without incident. On July\n15, he was joined on his rounds by General Neville, who had offered to act as\nhis guide in Allegheny County.[60] That evening, warning shots were fired at\nthe men at the [Miller farm](/wiki/Oliver_Miller_Homestead \"Oliver Miller\nHomestead\"), about 10 mi (16 km) south of Pittsburgh. Neville returned home\nwhile Lenox retreated to Pittsburgh.[61]\n\nOn July 16, at least 30 Mingo Creek militiamen surrounded Neville's fortified\nhome of Bower Hill.[62] They demanded the surrender of the federal marshal,\nwhom they believed to be inside. Neville responded by firing a gunshot that\nmortally wounded Oliver Miller, one of the \"rebels\".[63] The rebels opened\nfire but were unable to dislodge Neville, who had his slaves' help to defend\nthe house.[64] The rebels retreated to nearby Couch's Fort to gather\nreinforcements.[65]\n\nThe next day, the rebels returned to Bower Hill. Their force had swelled to\nnearly 600 men, now commanded by Major James McFarlane, a veteran of the\nRevolutionary War.[66] Neville had also received reinforcements: 10 U.S. Army\nsoldiers from Pittsburgh under the command of Major Abraham Kirkpatrick,\nNeville's brother-in-law.[67] Before the rebel force arrived, Kirkpatrick had\nNeville leave the house and hide in a nearby ravine. David Lenox and General\nNeville's son [Presley Neville](/wiki/Presley_Neville \"Presley Neville\") also\nreturned to the area, though they could not get into the house and were\ncaptured by the rebels.[68]\n\nFollowing some fruitless negotiations, the women and children were allowed to\nleave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour,\nMcFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved\nin the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the\nhouse, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the\nhouse, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered.[69] The\nnumber of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other\nmilitiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in\nthe fight.[70] The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and\nPresley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.[71]\n\n### March on Pittsburgh\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Hugh_Henry_Brackenridge.jpg/222px-\nHugh_Henry_Brackenridge.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hugh_Henry_Brackenridge.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hugh_Henry_Brackenridge.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPortrait of [Hugh Henry Brackenridge](/wiki/Hugh_Henry_Brackenridge \"Hugh\nHenry Brackenridge\"), a western opponent of the whiskey tax who tried to\nprevent violent resistance\n\nMcFarlane was given a hero's funeral on July 18. His \"murder\", as the rebels\nsaw it, further radicalized the countryside.[72] Moderates such as\nBrackenridge were hard-pressed to restrain the populace. Radical leaders\nemerged, such as [David Bradford](/wiki/David_Bradford_\\(lawyer\\) \"David\nBradford \\(lawyer\\)\"), urging violent resistance. On July 26, a group headed\nby Bradford robbed the [U.S. mail](/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service \"United\nStates Postal Service\") as it left Pittsburgh, hoping to discover who in that\ntown opposed them and finding several letters that condemned the rebels.\nBradford and his band called for a military assembly to meet at [Braddock's\nField](/wiki/Braddock%27s_Field \"Braddock's Field\"), about 8 mi (13 km) east\nof Pittsburgh.[73]\n\nOn August 1, about 7,000 people gathered at Braddock's Field.[74] The crowd\nconsisted primarily of poor people who owned no land, and most did not own\nwhiskey stills. The furor over the whiskey excise had unleashed anger about\nother economic grievances. By this time, the victims of violence were often\nwealthy property owners who had no connection to the whiskey tax.[75] Some of\nthe most radical protesters wanted to march on Pittsburgh, which they called\n\"[Sodom](/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah \"Sodom and Gomorrah\")\", loot the homes of\nthe wealthy, and then burn the town to the ground.[76] Others wanted to attack\n[Fort Fayette](/wiki/Fort_Fayette \"Fort Fayette\"). There was praise for the\n[French Revolution](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French Revolution\") and calls for\nbringing the [guillotine](/wiki/Guillotine \"Guillotine\") to America. David\nBradford, it was said, was comparing himself to\n[Robespierre](/wiki/Maximilien_Robespierre \"Maximilien Robespierre\"), a leader\nof the French [Reign of Terror](/wiki/Reign_of_Terror \"Reign of Terror\").[77]\n\nAt Braddock's Field, there was talk of declaring independence from the United\nStates and of joining with Spain or Great Britain. Radicals flew a specially\ndesigned flag that proclaimed their independence. The flag had six stripes,\none for each county represented at the gathering: the Pennsylvania counties of\nAllegheny, [Bedford](/wiki/Bedford_County,_Pennsylvania \"Bedford County,\nPennsylvania\"), Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland, and Virginia's [Ohio\nCounty](/wiki/Ohio_County,_West_Virginia \"Ohio County, West Virginia\").[78]\n\nPittsburgh citizens helped to defuse the threat by banishing three men whose\nintercepted letters had given offense to the rebels, and by sending a\ndelegation to Braddock's Field that expressed support for the gathering.[79]\nBrackenridge prevailed upon the crowd to limit the protest to a defiant march\nthrough the town. In Pittsburgh, Major Kirkpatrick's barns were burned, but\nnothing else.[80]\n\n### Meeting at Whiskey Point\n\nWhiskey Point [Pennsylvania Historical Marker\nsignification](/wiki/List_of_Pennsylvania_state_historical_markers \"List of\nPennsylvania state historical markers\")  \n---  \nLocation | Main Street between First Street & Park Avenue  \n[Monongahela](/wiki/Monongahela,_Pennsylvania \"Monongahela, Pennsylvania\")  \nCoordinates | [40°12′01″N 79°55′21″W﻿ / ﻿40.2002°N 79.9226°W﻿ / 40.2002; -79.9226](//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Whiskey_Rebellion&params=40.2002_N_-79.9226_E_type:landmark_region:US-PA)  \n[PA marker](/wiki/List_of_Pennsylvania_state_historical_markers \"List of Pennsylvania state historical markers\") dedicated | May 26, 1949[81]  \n  \nA convention was held on August 14 of 226 whiskey rebels from the six\ncounties, held at Parkison's Ferry (now known as Whiskey Point) in present-day\n[Monongahela](/wiki/Monongahela,_Pennsylvania \"Monongahela, Pennsylvania\").\nThe convention considered resolutions which were drafted by Brackenridge,\nGallatin, David Bradford, and an eccentric preacher named [Herman\nHusband](/wiki/Herman_Husband \"Herman Husband\"), a delegate from Bedford\nCounty. Husband was a well-known local figure and a radical champion of\ndemocracy who had taken part in the [Regulator\nmovement](/wiki/Regulator_movement \"Regulator movement\") in North Carolina 25\nyears earlier.[82] The Parkison's Ferry convention also appointed a committee\nto meet with the peace commissioners who had been sent west by President\nWashington.[83] There, Gallatin presented an eloquent speech in favor of peace\nand against proposals from Bradford to further revolt.[81]\n\n### Federal response\n\nPresident Washington was confronted with what appeared to be an armed\ninsurrection in western Pennsylvania, and he proceeded cautiously while\ndetermined to maintain governmental authority. He did not want to alienate\npublic opinion, so he asked his cabinet for written opinions about how to deal\nwith the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for\nSecretary of State [Edmund Randolph](/wiki/Edmund_Randolph \"Edmund Randolph\")\nwho urged reconciliation.[84] Washington did both: he sent commissioners to\nmeet with the rebels while raising a militia army. Washington privately\ndoubted that the commissioners could accomplish anything, and believed that a\nmilitary expedition would be needed to suppress further violence.[85] For this\nreason, historians have sometimes charged that the peace commission was sent\nonly for the sake of appearances, and that the use of force was never in\ndoubt.[86] Historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick argued that the\nmilitary expedition was \"itself a part of the reconciliation process\", since a\nshow of overwhelming force would make further violence less likely.[87]\n\nMeanwhile, Hamilton began publishing essays under the name of \"Tully\" in\nPhiladelphia newspapers, denouncing mob violence in western Pennsylvania and\nadvocating military action. [Democratic-Republican\nSocieties](/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Societies \"Democratic-Republican\nSocieties\") had been formed throughout the country, and Washington and\nHamilton believed that they were the source of civic unrest. \"Historians are\nnot yet agreed on the exact role of the societies\" in the Whiskey Rebellion,\nwrote historian Mark Spencer in 2003, \"but there was a degree of overlap\nbetween society membership and the Whiskey Rebels\".[88]\n\nBefore troops could be raised, the [Militia Act of\n1792](/wiki/Militia_Act_of_1792 \"Militia Act of 1792\") required a justice of\nthe [United States Supreme Court](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court \"United\nStates Supreme Court\") to certify that law enforcement was beyond the control\nof local authorities. On August 4, 1794, Justice [James\nWilson](/wiki/James_Wilson \"James Wilson\") delivered his opinion that western\nPennsylvania was in a state of rebellion.[89] On August 7, Washington issued a\npresidential proclamation announcing, with \"the deepest regret\", that the\nmilitia would be called out to suppress the rebellion. He commanded insurgents\nin western Pennsylvania to disperse by September 1.[90]\n\n#### Negotiations\n\nIn early August 1794, Washington dispatched three commissioners to the west,\nall of them Pennsylvanians: Attorney General [William\nBradford](/wiki/William_Bradford_\\(Attorney_General\\) \"William Bradford\n\\(Attorney General\\)\"), Justice [Jasper Yeates](/wiki/Jasper_Yeates \"Jasper\nYeates\") of the [Pennsylvania Supreme Court](/wiki/Pennsylvania_Supreme_Court\n\"Pennsylvania Supreme Court\"), and Senator [James\nRoss](/wiki/James_Ross_\\(Pennsylvania_congressman\\) \"James Ross \\(Pennsylvania\ncongressman\\)\"). Beginning on August 21, the commissioners met with a\ncommittee of westerners that included Brackenridge and Gallatin. The\ngovernment commissioners told the committee that it must unanimously agree to\nrenounce violence and submit to U.S. laws, and that a popular referendum must\nbe held to determine if the local people supported the decision. Those who\nagreed to these terms would be given amnesty from further prosecution.[91]\n\nThe committee was divided between radicals and moderates, and narrowly passed\na resolution agreeing to submit to the government's terms. The popular\nreferendum was held on September 11 and also produced mixed results. Some\ntownships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to\nthe government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people\npredominated.[92] The final report of the commissioners recommended the use of\nthe military to enforce the laws.[93] The trend was towards submission,\nhowever, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and [David\nRedick](/wiki/David_Redick \"David Redick\") to meet with Washington and to halt\nthe progress of the oncoming army. Washington and Hamilton declined, arguing\nthat violence was likely to re-emerge if the army turned back.[92]\n\n#### Militia expedition\n\nUnder the authority of the recently passed federal militia law, the state\nmilitias were called up by the governors of New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia,\nand Pennsylvania. The federalized militia force of 12,950 men was a large army\nby American standards of the time, comparable to Washington's armies during\nthe Revolution.[94] Relatively few men volunteered for militia service, so a\n[draft](/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States \"Conscription in the United\nStates\") was used to fill out the ranks. Draft evasion was widespread, and\nconscription efforts resulted in protests and riots, even in eastern areas.\nThree counties in eastern Virginia were the scenes of armed draft resistance.\nIn Maryland, Governor [Thomas Sim Lee](/wiki/Thomas_Sim_Lee \"Thomas Sim Lee\")\nsent 800 men to quash an antidraft riot in\n[Hagerstown](/wiki/Hagerstown,_Maryland \"Hagerstown, Maryland\"); about 150\npeople were arrested.[95]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/AlbertGallatin.jpeg/220px-\nAlbertGallatin.jpeg)](/wiki/File:AlbertGallatin.jpeg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:AlbertGallatin.jpeg \"Enlarge\")\n\nPhoto of [Albert Gallatin](/wiki/Albert_Gallatin \"Albert Gallatin\"), who spoke\npublicly to rebel groups about the need for moderation\n\n[Liberty poles](/wiki/Liberty_pole \"Liberty pole\") were raised in various\nplaces as the militia was recruited, worrying federal officials. A liberty\npole was raised in [Carlisle, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Carlisle,_Pennsylvania\n\"Carlisle, Pennsylvania\") on September 11, 1794.[96] The federalized militia\narrived in that town later that month and rounded up suspected pole-raisers.\nTwo civilians were killed in these operations. On September 29, an unarmed boy\nwas shot by an officer whose pistol accidentally fired. Two days later, an\n\"Itinerant Person\" was \"Bayoneted\" to death by a soldier while resisting\narrest (the man had tried to wrest the rifle from the soldier he confronted;\nit is possible he had been a member of a 500-strong Irish work crew nearby who\nwere \"digging, a canal into the Sculkill\" [sic]; at least one of that work\ngang's members protested the killing so vigorously that he was \"put under\nguard\").[97] President Washington ordered the arrest of the two soldiers and\nhad them turned over to civilian authorities. A state judge determined that\nthe deaths had been accidental, and the soldiers were released.[98]\n\nIn October 1794, Washington traveled west to review the progress of the\nmilitary expedition. According to historian [Joseph Ellis](/wiki/Joseph_Ellis\n\"Joseph Ellis\"), this was \"the first and only time a sitting American\npresident led troops in the field\".[99] [Jonathan\nForman](/w/index.php?title=Jonathan_Forman&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Jonathan\nForman \\(page does not exist\\)\") led the Third Infantry Regiment of New Jersey\ntroops against the Whiskey Rebellion, he wrote about his encounter with\nWashington:[100]\n\n> October 3d Marched early in the morning for Harrisburgh, where we arrived\n> about 12 O'clock. About 1 O'Clock recd. information of the Presidents\n> approach on which, I had the regiment paraded, timely for his reception, &\n> considerably to my satisfaction. Being afterwards invited to his quarters he\n> made enquiry into the circumstances of the man [an incident between an\n> \"Itinerant Person\" and \"an Old Soldier\" mentioned earlier in the journal (p.\n> 3)] & seemed satisfied with the information.[97]\n\nWashington met with the western representatives in [Bedford,\nPennsylvania](/wiki/Bedford,_Pennsylvania \"Bedford, Pennsylvania\") on October\n9 before going to [Fort Cumberland](/wiki/Fort_Cumberland_\\(Maryland\\) \"Fort\nCumberland \\(Maryland\\)\") in Maryland to review the southern wing of the\narmy.[101] He was convinced that the federalized militia would meet little\nresistance, and he placed the army under the command of the Virginia Governor\n[Henry \"Lighthorse Harry\" Lee](/wiki/Henry_Lee_III \"Henry Lee III\"), a hero of\nthe Revolutionary War. Washington returned to Philadelphia; Hamilton remained\nwith the army as civilian adviser.[102]\n\n[Daniel Morgan](/wiki/Daniel_Morgan \"Daniel Morgan\"), a general key to the\nwinning of the American Revolution, was called up to lead a force to suppress\nthe protest. It was at this time (1794) that Morgan was promoted to Major\nGeneral. Serving under General [\"Light-Horse Harry\" Lee](/wiki/Henry_Lee_III\n\"Henry Lee III\"), Morgan led one wing of the militia army into [Western\nPennsylvania](/wiki/Western_Pennsylvania \"Western Pennsylvania\").[103] The\nmassive show of force brought an end to the protests without a shot being\nfired. After the uprising had been suppressed, Morgan commanded the remnant of\nthe army that remained until 1795 in Pennsylvania, some 1,200 militiamen, one\nof whom was [Meriwether Lewis](/wiki/Meriwether_Lewis \"Meriwether\nLewis\").[104]\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe insurrection collapsed as the federal army marched west into western\nPennsylvania in October 1794. Some of the most prominent leaders of the\ninsurrection, such as David Bradford, fled westward to safety. It took six\nmonths for those who were charged to be tried. Most were acquitted due to\nmistaken identity, unreliable testimony and lack of witnesses. The only two\nconvicted of treason and sentenced to hang were John Mitchell and Philip\nWigle. They were later [pardoned by\nWashington](/wiki/List_of_people_pardoned_or_granted_clemency_by_the_President_of_the_United_States#George_Washington\n\"List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United\nStates\").[105][106]\n\nImmediately before the arrests \"... as many as 2,000 of [the rebels] – had\nfled into the mountains, beyond the reach of the militia. It was a great\ndisappointment to Hamilton, who had hoped to bring rebel leaders such as David\nBradford to trial in Philadelphia – and possibly see them hanged for\n[treason](/wiki/Treason \"Treason\"). Instead, when the militia at last turned\nback, out of all the suspects they had seized a mere twenty were selected to\nserve as examples, They were at worst bit players in the uprising, but they\nwere better than nothing.\"[105]\n\nThe captured participants and the Federal militia arrived in Philadelphia on\nChristmas Day. Some artillery was fired and church bells were heard as \"... a\nhuge throng lined Broad Street to cheer the troops and mock the rebels ...\n[Presley] Neville said he 'could not help feeling sorry for them. The captured\nrebels were paraded down Broad Street being 'humiliated, bedragged, [and]\nhalf-starved ...' \"[105]\n\nOther accounts describe the indictment of 24 men for high\n[treason](/wiki/Treason \"Treason\").[107] Most of the accused had eluded\ncapture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court.[108] Of\nthese, only Philip Wigle[111] and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had\nbeaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who\nhad been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were\nsentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President\nWashington.[112] Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting\nlawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting.[113] While\nviolent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax\ncontinued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") and helped him defeat\nPresident [John Adams](/wiki/John_Adams \"John Adams\") in the [election of\n1800](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800 \"United States\npresidential election, 1800\"). By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled\nspirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the [War of\n1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\"), the Federal government would rely\nsolely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation's\nexpanding foreign trade.[22]\n\n## Legacy\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/JamesMillerHouse.jpg/220px-\nJamesMillerHouse.jpg)](/wiki/File:JamesMillerHouse.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:JamesMillerHouse.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe James Miller House on the Oliver Miller Homestead located in South Park\nTownship, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. In 1794, the first fired gunshots of\nthe Whiskey Rebellion occurred on the property when revenue officers served a\nwrit on William Miller. Shots were fired but the officers were not injured.\nLater, William was pardoned.\n\nThe Washington administration's suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion met with\nwidespread popular approval.[114] The episode demonstrated that the new\nnational government had the willingness and ability to suppress violent\nresistance to its laws. It was, therefore, viewed by the Washington\nadministration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by\nhistorians.[115] The Washington administration and its supporters usually did\nnot mention, however, that the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect,\nand that many westerners continued to refuse to pay the tax.[33] The events\ncontributed to the formation of political parties in the United States, a\nprocess already underway.[116] The whiskey tax was repealed after [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\")'s [Republican\nParty](/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party \"Democratic-Republican Party\") came\nto power in 1801, which opposed the [Federalist Party](/wiki/Federalist_Party\n\"Federalist Party\") of Hamilton and Washington.[117]\n\nThe Rebellion raised the question of what kinds of protests were permissible\nunder the new Constitution. Legal historian [Christian G.\nFritz](/wiki/Christian_G._Fritz \"Christian G. Fritz\") argued that there was\nnot yet a consensus about\n[sovereignty](/wiki/Popular_sovereignty_in_the_United_States \"Popular\nsovereignty in the United States\") in the United States, even after\nratification of the Constitution. Federalists believed that the government was\nsovereign because it had been established by the people; radical protest\nactions were permissible during the American Revolution but were no longer\nlegitimate, in their thinking. But the Whiskey Rebels and their defenders\nbelieved that the Revolution had established the people as a \"collective\nsovereign\", and the people had the collective right to change or challenge the\ngovernment through extra-constitutional means.[118]\n\nHistorian Steven Boyd argued that the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion\nprompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution and to\nseek change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government.\nFederalists, for their part, came to accept the public's role in governance\nand no longer challenged the [freedom of assembly](/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly\n\"Freedom of assembly\") and the [right to petition](/wiki/Right_to_petition\n\"Right to petition\").[119]\n\n### In popular culture\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Susanna_Rowson_crop.jpg/100px-\nSusanna_Rowson_crop.jpg)](/wiki/File:Susanna_Rowson_crop.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Susanna_Rowson_crop.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSusanna Rowson\n\nSoon after the Whiskey Rebellion, actress-playwright [Susanna\nRowson](/wiki/Susanna_Rowson \"Susanna Rowson\") wrote a stage musical about the\ninsurrection entitled _The Volunteers_ , with music by composer [Alexander\nReinagle](/wiki/Alexander_Reinagle \"Alexander Reinagle\"). The play is now\nlost, but the songs survive and suggest that Rowson's interpretation was pro-\nFederalist. The musical celebrates as American heroes the militiamen who put\ndown the rebellion, the \"volunteers\" of the title.[120] President Washington\nand [Martha Washington](/wiki/Martha_Washington \"Martha Washington\") attended\na performance of the play in Philadelphia in January 1795.[121] [W. C.\nFields](/wiki/W._C._Fields \"W. C.

His Only\nRecording Plus 8 Songs by Mae West_. The bit discussed Washington and his role\nin putting down the Whiskey Rebellion, and Fields wondered aloud whether\n\"George put down a little of the vile stuff too.\"[122]\n\n[L.

In it,\n[Albert Gallatin](/wiki/Albert_Gallatin \"Albert Gallatin\") joins the rebellion\nin 1794 to benefit the farmers, rather than the fledgling US Government as he\ndid in reality. This results in the rebellion becoming a [Second American\nRevolution](/wiki/Second_American_Revolution \"Second American Revolution\").\nThis eventually leads to George Washington being overthrown and executed for\ntreason, the abrogation of the [Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution\n\"United States Constitution\"), and Gallatin being proclaimed the second\npresident and serving as president until 1812.[123][124]\n\n[David Liss](/wiki/David_Liss \"David Liss\")' 2008 novel _[The Whiskey\nRebels](/wiki/The_Whiskey_Rebels \"The Whiskey Rebels\")_ covers many of the\ncircumstances during 1788-92 that led to the 1794 Rebellion.
