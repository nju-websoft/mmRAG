It is one of several\n[Lunar New Years](/wiki/Lunar_New_Year \"Lunar New Year\") in Asia. Celebrations\ntraditionally run from the evening preceding the first day, to the [Lantern\nFestival](/wiki/Lantern_Festival \"Lantern Festival\") on the 15th day of the\nfirst calendar month. The first day of the New Year falls on the new moon\nbetween January 21 and February 20[2] In 2018, the first day of the Lunar New\nYear was on Friday, 16 February, initiating the [year of the\nDog](/wiki/Dog_\\(zodiac\\) \"Dog \\(zodiac\\)\").\n\nIt is one of the world's most prominent and celebrated festivals, and involves\nthe largest annual mass human migration in the world. It is a major holiday in\n[Greater China](/wiki/Greater_China \"Greater China\") and has strongly\ninfluenced the lunar new year celebrations of China's neighbouring cultures,\nincluding the [Korean New Year](/wiki/Korean_New_Year \"Korean New Year\")\n(seol), the [Tết](/wiki/T%E1%BA%BFt \"Tết\") of Vietnam, and the\n[Losar](/wiki/Losar \"Losar\") of Tibet.[3] It is also celebrated worldwide in\ncountries with significant [Overseas Chinese](/wiki/Overseas_Chinese \"Overseas\nChinese\") populations, including [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore \"Singapore\"),[4]\n[Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia \"Indonesia\"), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia\n\"Malaysia\"), [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand \"Thailand\"), [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia\n\"Cambodia\"), [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\"), the\n[Philippines](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\")[5][6] and\n[Mauritius](/wiki/Mauritius \"Mauritius\"),[7] as well as many countries in\nNorth America and Europe.[8][9][10]\n\nThe New Year festival is centuries old and associated with several myths and\ncustoms. Traditionally, the festival was a time to honour\n[deities](/wiki/Deities \"Deities\") as well as ancestors.[11] Within China,\nregional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the Lunar New\nYear vary widely. Often, the evening preceding Lunar New Year's Day is an\noccasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual [reunion\ndinner](/wiki/Reunion_dinner \"Reunion dinner\"). It is also traditional for\nevery family to thoroughly clean the house, in order to sweep away any ill-\nfortune and to make way for incoming good luck. Windows and doors are\ndecorated with red colour [paper-cuts](/wiki/Chinese_paper_cutting \"Chinese\npaper cutting\") and [couplets](/wiki/Couplet_\\(Chinese_poetry\\) \"Couplet\n\\(Chinese poetry\\)\") with popular themes of [\"good fortune\" or\n\"happiness\"](/wiki/Fu_character \"Fu character\"), \"wealth\", and \"longevity\".\nOther activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in [red paper\nenvelopes](/wiki/Red_envelopes \"Red envelopes\"). In about one third of the\nMainland population, or 500 million Northerners, dumplings (especially those\nof vegetarian fillings) feature prominently in the meals celebrating the\nfestival.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Offerings_to_the_Gods.jpg/220px-\nOfferings_to_the_Gods.jpg)](/wiki/File:Offerings_to_the_Gods.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Offerings_to_the_Gods.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nOfferings to the gods.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Dates in Chinese lunisolar calendar\n  * 2 Mythology\n  * 3 Public holiday\n  * 4 Festivities\n    * 4.1 Preceding days\n    * 4.2 New Year's Eve\n    * 4.3 First day\n    * 4.4 Second day\n    * 4.5 Third day\n    * 4.6 Fourth day\n    * 4.7 Fifth day\n    * 4.8 Seventh day\n    * 4.9 Eighth day\n    * 4.10 Ninth day\n    * 4.11 Tenth day\n    * 4.12 Fifteenth day\n  * 5 Traditional food\n  * 6 Practices\n    * 6.1 History\n    * 6.2 Red envelopes\n    * 6.3 Gift exchange\n    * 6.4 Markets\n    * 6.5 Fireworks\n      * 6.5.1 Firecracker ban\n    * 6.6 Music\n    * 6.7 Clothing\n    * 6.8 Family portrait\n    * 6.9 Symbolism\n    * 6.10 Nianhua\n    * 6.11 Flowers\n    * 6.12 Icons and ornaments\n    * 6.13 Spring travel\n  * 7 Festivities outside Greater China\n    * 7.1 Southeast Asia\n      * 7.1.1 Indonesia\n    * 7.2 Australia and New Zealand\n    * 7.3 North America\n      * 7.3.1 New York\n      * 7.3.2 California\n    * 7.4 Europe\n    * 7.5 India and Pakistan\n  * 8 Greetings\n  * 9 See also\n  * 10 Notes\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 Further reading\n  * 13 External links\n\n## Dates in Chinese lunisolar\ncalendar[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Dates in Chinese lunisolar calendar\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Chinese_New_Year_decorations_along_New_Bridge_Road%2C_Singapore_-_20150215.jpg/220px-\nChinese_New_Year_decorations_along_New_Bridge_Road%2C_Singapore_-_20150215.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chinese_New_Year_decorations_along_New_Bridge_Road,_Singapore_-_20150215.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chinese_New_Year_decorations_along_New_Bridge_Road,_Singapore_-_20150215.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nChinese New Year in Singapore Chinatown.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/New_Year_Scene.jpg/220px-\nNew_Year_Scene.jpg)](/wiki/File:New_Year_Scene.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:New_Year_Scene.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nChinese New Year eve in Meizhou on 8 February 2005.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/140201_Chinese_New_Year_2014_Kobe_Chinatown_Japan05s5.jpg/220px-140201_Chinese_New_Year_2014_Kobe_Chinatown_Japan05s5.jpg)](/wiki/File:140201_Chinese_New_Year_2014_Kobe_Chinatown_Japan05s5.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:140201_Chinese_New_Year_2014_Kobe_Chinatown_Japan05s5.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nChinese New Year in [Kobe](/wiki/Kobe \"Kobe\"), Japan\n\n[![Temple at night illuminated with light from\ndecorations](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Ke_Lok_Si_Illuminations_01.JPG/220px-\nKe_Lok_Si_Illuminations_01.JPG)](/wiki/File:Ke_Lok_Si_Illuminations_01.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Ke_Lok_Si_Illuminations_01.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nSoutheast Asia's largest temple – [Kek Lok Si](/wiki/Kek_Lok_Si \"Kek Lok Si\")\nnear [George Town](/wiki/George_Town,_Penang \"George Town, Penang\") in\n[Penang](/wiki/Penang \"Penang\"), Malaysia – illuminated in preparation for the\nLunar New Year.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Chinese_new_year_dates_SMIL.svg/220px-\nChinese_new_year_dates_SMIL.svg.png)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Chinese_new_year_dates_SMIL.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chinese_new_year_dates_SMIL.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nInteractive chart of the dates of Chinese New Year from 1912 to 2101.[12] In\n[the SVG\ngraphic,](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Chinese_new_year_dates_SMIL.svg)\nhover over or click a year on the left to highlight an almost-repeating block\nof 19 years starting with that year.\n\nMain article: [Chinese calendar](/wiki/Chinese_calendar \"Chinese calendar\")\n\nThe [lunisolar](/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar \"Lunisolar calendar\") Chinese\ncalendar determines the date of Lunar New Year. The calendar is also used in\ncountries that have been influenced by, or have relations with, China – such\nas Korea, Japan and Vietnam, though occasionally the date celebrated may\ndiffer by one day or even one moon cycle due to using a meridian based on a\ndifferent capital city in a different time zone or different placements of\nintercalary months.[13]\n\n[Chinese calendar](/wiki/Chinese_calendar \"Chinese calendar\") defines the\n[lunar month](/wiki/Lunar_month \"Lunar month\") with [winter\nsolstice](/wiki/Solstice \"Solstice\") as the 11th month, which means that\nChinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter\nsolstice (rarely the third if an [intercalary\nmonth](/wiki/Intercalation_\\(timekeeping\\) \"Intercalation \\(timekeeping\\)\")\nintervenes).[14] In more than 96% of the years, the Chinese New Year's Day is\nthe closest [new moon](/wiki/New_moon \"New moon\") to [lichun](/wiki/Lichun\n\"Lichun\") ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language \"Chinese language\"): 立春; \"_start\nof spring_ \") on 4 or 5 February, and the first new moon after\n[Dahan](/wiki/Dahan_\\(solar_term\\) \"Dahan \\(solar term\\)\")\n([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language \"Chinese language\"): 大寒; \"_major cold_ \").\nIn the [Gregorian calendar](/wiki/Gregorian_calendar \"Gregorian calendar\"),\nthe Lunar New Year begins at the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20\nFebruary.[12][_[verification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\n\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")_]\n\nThe Gregorian Calendar dates for Chinese New Year from 1912 to 2101 are below,\nalong with the year's presiding animal [zodiac](/wiki/Chinese_zodiac \"Chinese\nzodiac\") and its Stem-branch. The traditional [Chinese\ncalendar](/wiki/Chinese_calendar \"Chinese calendar\") follows a Metonic cycle\n(like the modern [Jewish Calendar](/wiki/Jewish_Calendar \"Jewish Calendar\")),\nand returns to the same date in Gregorian calendar roughly. The names of the\n[Earthly Branches](/wiki/Earthly_Branches \"Earthly Branches\") have no English\ncounterparts and are _not_ the Chinese translations of the animals. Alongside\nthe 12-year cycle of the animal zodiac there is a 10-year cycle of [heavenly\nstems](/wiki/Heavenly_stem \"Heavenly stem\"). Each of the ten heavenly stems is\nassociated with one of the [five elements](/wiki/Wu_Xing \"Wu Xing\") of\n[Chinese astrology](/wiki/Chinese_astrology \"Chinese astrology\"), namely:\n[Wood](/wiki/Tree_\\(Wu_Xing\\) \"Tree \\(Wu Xing\\)\"),\n[Fire](/wiki/Fire_\\(Wu_Xing\\) \"Fire \\(Wu Xing\\)\"),\n[Earth](/wiki/Earth_\\(Wu_Xing\\) \"Earth \\(Wu Xing\\)\"),\n[Metal](/wiki/Metal_\\(Wu_Xing\\) \"Metal \\(Wu Xing\\)\"), and\n[Water](/wiki/Water_\\(Wu_Xing\\) \"Water \\(Wu Xing\\)\"). The elements are rotated\nevery two years while a [yin and yang](/wiki/Yin_and_yang \"Yin and yang\")\nassociation alternates every year. The elements are thus distinguished: Yang\nWood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire, etc. These produce a combined cycle that\nrepeats every 60 years. For example, the year of the Yang Fire\n[Rat](/wiki/Rat_\\(zodiac\\) \"Rat \\(zodiac\\)\") occurred in 1936 and in 1996, 60\nyears apart.\n\nMany people inaccurately calculate their Chinese birth-year by converting it\nfrom their Gregorian birth-year. As the Chinese New Year starts in late\nJanuary to mid-February, the previous Chinese year dates through 1 January\nuntil that day in the new Gregorian year, remaining unchanged from the\nprevious Gregorian year. For example, the 1989 year of the\n[Snake](/wiki/Snake_\\(zodiac\\) \"Snake \\(zodiac\\)\") began on 6 February 1989.\nThe year 1989 is generally aligned with the year of the\n[Snake](/wiki/Snake_\\(zodiac\\) \"Snake \\(zodiac\\)\"). However, the 1988 year of\nthe [Dragon](/wiki/Dragon_\\(zodiac\\) \"Dragon \\(zodiac\\)\") officially ended on\n5 February 1989. This means that anyone born from 1 January to 5 February 1989\nwas actually born in the year of the [Dragon](/wiki/Dragon_\\(zodiac\\) \"Dragon\n\\(zodiac\\)\") rather than the year of the [Snake](/wiki/Snake_\\(zodiac\\) \"Snake\n\\(zodiac\\)\"). Many online Chinese Sign calculators do not account for the non-\nalignment of the two calendars, using Gregorian-calendar years rather than\nofficial Chinese New Year dates.[15]\n\nOne scheme of [continuously numbered Chinese-calendar\nyears](/wiki/Chinese_calendar#Continuously_numbered_years \"Chinese calendar\")\nassigns 4709 to the year beginning, 2011, but this is not universally\naccepted; the calendar is traditionally cyclical, not continuously numbered.\n\nAlthough the Chinese calendar traditionally does not use continuously numbered\nyears, outside China its years are sometimes numbered from the purported reign\nof the mythical [Yellow Emperor](/wiki/Yellow_Emperor \"Yellow Emperor\") in the\n[3rd millennium BCE](/wiki/3rd_millennium_BCE \"3rd millennium BCE\"). But at\nleast three different years numbered 1 are now used by various scholars,\nmaking the year beginning [CE](/wiki/Common_Era \"Common Era\") 2015 the\n\"Chinese year\" 4712, 4713, or 4652.[16]\n\nGregorian | Date | Animal | Day of the week |  | Gregorian | Date | Animal | Day of the week  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n2001 | 24 Jan | [Snake](/wiki/Snake_\\(zodiac\\)

Nian would eat\nvillagers, especially children. One year, all the villagers decided to go hide\nfrom the beast. An old man appeared before the villagers went into hiding and\nsaid that he's going to stay the night, and decided to get revenge on the\nNian. All the villagers thought he was insane. The old man put red papers up\nand set off firecrackers. The day after, the villagers came back to their town\nto see that nothing was destroyed. They assumed that the old man was a deity\nwho came to save them. The villagers then understood that the Nian was afraid\nof the color red and loud noises. When the New Year was about to come, the\nvillagers would wear red clothes, hang red lanterns, and red spring scrolls on\nwindows and doors. People also used firecrackers to frighten away the Nian.\nFrom then on, Nian never came to the village again. The Nian was eventually\ncaptured by [Hongjun Laozu](/wiki/Hongjun_Laozu \"Hongjun Laozu\"), an ancient\nTaoist monk. After that, Nian retreated to a nearby mountain. The name of the\nmountain has long been lost over the years.[17]\n\n## Public\nholiday[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Public holiday\")]\n\nChinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in a number of countries and\nterritories where there is a sizable Chinese population. Since Chinese New\nYear falls on different dates on the Gregorian calendar every year on\ndifferent days of the week, some of these governments opt to shift working\ndays in order to accommodate a longer public holiday. In some countries, a\nstatutory holiday is added on the following work day when the New Year falls\non a weekend, as in the case of 2013, where the New Year's Eve (9 February)\nfalls on Saturday and the New Year's Day (10 February) on Sunday. Depending on\nthe country, the holiday may be termed differently; common names are \"Chinese\nNew Year\", \"Lunar New Year\", \"New Year Festival\", and \"Spring Festival\".\n\nFor New Year celebrations that are lunar but not based on the Chinese New Year\n(such as Korea's [_Seollal_](/wiki/Korean_New_Year \"Korean New Year\") and\nVietnam's _[Tết](/wiki/T%E1%BA%BFt \"Tết\")_), see the article on [Lunar New\nYear](/wiki/Lunar_New_Year \"Lunar New Year\").\n\nFor other countries where Chinese New Year is celebrated but not an official\nholiday, see the section below on Festivities outside China.\n\nCountry and region | Official name | Description | Number of days  \n---|---|---|---  \nBrunei | Tahun Baru Cina | New Year's Eve (half-day) and New Year's Day.[18] | 1  \nHong Kong | Lunar New Year | The first three days.[19] | 3  \nIndonesia | Tahun Baru Imlek (Sin Cia) | New Year's Day.[20][21] | 1  \nMacau | Chinese New Year | The first three days.[22] | 3  \n[Mainland China](/wiki/Mainland_China \"Mainland China\") | Spring Festival (Chūn Jié) | The first 3 days.

Influenced by the flourished cultures, foods from\ndifferent places look and taste totally different. Among them, the most well-\nknown ones are dumplings from northern China and Tangyuan from southern China.\n\n### Preceding\ndays[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Preceding days\")]\n\nOn the eighth day of the lunar month prior to Chinese New Year, the [_Laba_\nholiday](/wiki/Laba_Festival \"Laba Festival\") (simplified Chinese: 腊八;\ntraditional Chinese: 臘八; pinyin: _làbā_), a traditional porridge, [Laba\nporridge](/wiki/Laba_porridge \"Laba porridge\") (simplified Chinese: 腊八粥;\ntraditional Chinese: 臘八粥; pinyin: _làbā zhōu_), is served in remembrance of an\nancient festival, called _La_ , that occurred shortly after the winter\nsolstice.[35] Pickles such as Laba garlic, which turns green from vinegar, are\nalso made on this day. For those that believe in Buddhism, the Laba holiday is\nalso considered [Bodhi Day](/wiki/Bodhi_Day \"Bodhi Day\"). _Layue_ (simplified\nChinese: 腊月; traditional Chinese: 臘月; pinyin: _Làyuè_) is a term often\nassociated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honor\nof the gods in the twelfth lunar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New\nYear are known as _larou_ (simplified Chinese: 腊肉; traditional Chinese: 臘肉;\npinyin: _làròu_). The porridge was prepared by the women of the household at\nfirst light, with the first bowl offered to the family's ancestors and the\nhousehold deities. Every member of the family was then served a bowl, with\nleftovers distributed to relatives and friends.[36] It's still served as a\nspecial breakfast on this day in some Chinese homes. The concept of the \"La\nmonth\" is similar to [Advent](/wiki/Advent \"Advent\") in Christianity. Many\nfamilies eat vegetarian on Chinese New Year eve, the garlic and preserved meat\nare eaten on Chinese New Year day.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Receive_the_gods_in_chinese_new_year_1.jpg/220px-\nReceive_the_gods_in_chinese_new_year_1.jpg)](/wiki/File:Receive_the_gods_in_chinese_new_year_1.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Receive_the_gods_in_chinese_new_year_1.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nReceive the Gods in Chinese New Year, (1900s)\n\nOn the days immediately before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give\ntheir homes a thorough cleaning. There is a Cantonese saying \"Wash away the\ndirt on _nin ya baat_ \" (Chinese: 年廿八，洗邋遢; pinyin: _nián niàn bā, xǐ lātà_ ;\nJyutping: _nin4 jaa6 baat3, sai2 laap6 taap3 (laat6 taat3)_), but the practice\nis not restricted to _nin ya baat_ (the 28th day of month 12). It is believed\nthe cleaning sweeps away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their\nhomes ready for good luck. Brooms and dust pans are put away on the first day\nso that the newly arrived good luck cannot be swept away. Some people give\ntheir homes, doors and window-frames a new coat of red paint; decorators and\npaper-hangers do a year-end rush of business prior to Chinese New Year.[37]\nHomes are often decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and\n[couplets](/wiki/Couplet_\\(Chinese_poetry\\) \"Couplet \\(Chinese poetry\\)\").\nPurchasing new clothing and shoes also symbolize a new start. Any hair cuts\nneed to be completed before the New Year, as cutting hair on New Year is\nconsidered bad luck due to the homonymic nature of the word \"hair\" (fa) and\nthe word for \"prosperity\". Businesses are expected to pay off all the debts\noutstanding for the year before the new year eve, extending to debts of\ngratitude. Thus it is a common practice to send gifts and rice to close\nbusiness associates, and extended family members.\n\nIn many households where Buddhism or Taoism is prevalent, home altars and\nstatues are cleaned thoroughly, and decorations used to adorn altars over the\npast year are taken down and burned a week before the new year starts, to be\nreplaced with new decorations. Taoists (and Buddhists to a lesser extent) will\nalso \"send gods back to heaven\" (Chinese: 送神; pinyin: _sòngshén_), an example\nwould be burning a paper effigy of [Zao Jun the Kitchen God](/wiki/Kitchen_God\n\"Kitchen God\"), the recorder of family functions. This is done so that the\nKitchen God can report to the [Jade Emperor](/wiki/Jade_Emperor \"Jade\nEmperor\") of the family household's transgressions and good deeds. Families\noften offer sweet foods (such as candy) in order to \"bribe\" the deities into\nreporting good things about the family.\n\nPrior to the Reunion Dinner, a prayer of thanksgiving is held to mark the safe\npassage of the previous year. Confucianists take the opportunity to remember\ntheir ancestors, and those who had lived before them are revered. Some people\ndo not give a Buddhist prayer due to the influence of Christianity, with a\nChristian prayer offered instead.\n\n### New Year's\nEve[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: New Year's Eve\")]\n\nThe biggest event of any Chinese New Year's Eve is the annual [reunion\ndinner](/wiki/Reunion_dinner \"Reunion dinner\"). Dishes consisting of special\nmeats are served at the tables, as a main course for the dinner and offering\nfor the New Year. This meal is comparable to Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S.\nand remotely similar to Christmas dinner in other countries with a high\npercentage of Christians.\n\nIn northern China, it is customary to make dumplings ([jiaozi](/wiki/Jiaozi\n\"Jiaozi\")) after dinner to eat around midnight. Dumplings symbolize wealth\nbecause their shape resembles a Chinese [sycee](/wiki/Sycee \"Sycee\"). In\ncontrast, in the South, it is customary to make a glutinous new year cake\n([niangao](/wiki/Niangao \"Niangao\")) and send pieces of it as gifts to\nrelatives and friends in the coming days. Niángāo [Pinyin] literally means\n\"new year cake\" with a homophonous meaning of \"increasingly prosperous year in\nyear out\".[38]\n\nAfter dinner, some families go to local temples hours before the new year\nbegins to pray for a prosperous new year by lighting the first incense of the\nyear; however in modern practice, many households hold parties and even hold a\ncountdown to the new year. Traditionally, firecrackers were lit to scare away\nevil spirits with the household doors sealed, not to be reopened until the new\nmorning in a ritual called \"opening the door of fortune\" (simplified Chinese:\n开财门; traditional Chinese: 開財門; pinyin: _kāicáimén_).[39]\n\nBeginning in 1982, the _[CCTV New Year's Gala](/wiki/CCTV_New_Year%27s_Gala\n\"CCTV New Year's Gala\")_ is broadcast in China four hours before the start of\nthe New Year and lasts until the succeeding early morning. A tradition of\ngoing to bed late on New Year's Eve, or even keeping awake the whole night and\nmorning, known as _shousui_ (守岁), is still practised as it is thought to add\non to one's parents' longevity.\n\n### First day[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: First day\")]\n\nThe first day is for the welcoming of the deities of the heavens and earth,\nofficially beginning at midnight. It is a traditional practice to light\nfireworks, burn bamboo sticks and firecrackers and to make as much of a din as\npossible to chase off the evil spirits as encapsulated by _nian_ of which the\nterm _Guo Nian_ was derived. Many [Buddhists](/wiki/Buddhist \"Buddhist\")\nabstain from meat consumption on the first day because it is believed to\nensure [longevity](/wiki/Longevity \"Longevity\") for them. Some consider\nlighting fires and using knives to be bad luck on New Year's Day, so all food\nto be consumed is cooked the days before. On this day, it is considered bad\nluck to use the broom, as good fortune is not to be \"swept away\" symbolically.\n\nMost importantly, the first day of Chinese New Year is a time to honor one's\nelders and families visit the oldest and most senior members of their extended\nfamilies, usually their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.\n\nFor Buddhists, the first day is also the birthday of [Maitreya](/wiki/Maitreya\n\"Maitreya\") [Bodhisattva](/wiki/Bodhisattva \"Bodhisattva\") (better known as\nthe more familiar [Budai Luohan](/wiki/Budai \"Budai\")), the Buddha-to-be.\nPeople also abstain from killing animals.\n\nSome families may invite a [lion dance](/wiki/Lion_dance \"Lion dance\") troupe\nas a symbolic ritual to usher in the Chinese New Year as well as to evict bad\nspirits from the premises. Members of the family who are married also give\n[red envelopes](/wiki/Red_envelopes \"Red envelopes\") containing cash known as\n_lai see_ (Cantonese dialect) or _angpow_ (Hokkien dialect/Fujian), or\n_hongbao_ (Mandarin), a form of blessings and to suppress the aging and\nchallenges associated with the coming year, to junior members of the family,\nmostly children and teenagers. Business managers also give bonuses through red\npackets to employees for good luck, smooth-sailing, good health and wealth.\n\nWhile fireworks and firecrackers are traditionally very popular, some regions\nhave banned them due to concerns over fire hazards. For this reason, various\ncity governments (e.g., Kowloon, Beijing, Shanghai for a number of years)\nissued bans over fireworks and firecrackers in certain precincts of the city.\nAs a substitute, large-scale fireworks display have been launched by\ngovernments in such city-states as Hong Kong and Singapore. However, it is a\ntradition that the indigenous peoples of the [walled\nvillages](/wiki/Walled_village \"Walled village\") of [New\nTerritories](/wiki/New_Territories \"New Territories\"), Hong Kong are permitted\nto light [firecrackers](/wiki/Firecrackers \"Firecrackers\") and launch\n[fireworks](/wiki/Fireworks \"Fireworks\") in a limited scale.\n\n### Second\nday[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Second day\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Incence_at_grave.JPG/170px-\nIncence_at_grave.JPG)](/wiki/File:Incence_at_grave.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Incence_at_grave.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Incense](/wiki/Incense \"Incense\") is burned at the graves of ancestors as\npart of the offering and prayer rituals.\n\nThe second day of the Chinese New Year, known as \"beginning of the year\"\n(simplified Chinese: 开年; traditional Chinese: 開年; pinyin: _kāinián_),[40] was\nwhen married daughters visited their birth parents, relatives and close\nfriends. (Traditionally, married daughters didn't have the opportunity to\nvisit their birth families frequently.)\n\nDuring the days of imperial China, \"beggars and other unemployed people\ncirculate[d] from family to family, carrying a picture [of the God of Wealth]\nshouting, \"_Cai Shen dao_!\" [The God of Wealth has come!].\"[41] Householders\nwould respond with \"lucky money\" to reward the messengers. Business people of\nthe Cantonese dialect group will hold a 'Hoi Nin' prayer to start their\nbusiness on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year so they will be blessed with good\nluck and prosperity in their business for the year.\n\nAs this day is believed to be [The Birthday of Che\nKung](/wiki/The_Birthday_of_Che_Kung \"The Birthday of Che Kung\"), a deity\nworshipped in Hong Kong, worshippers go to [Che Kung\nTemples](/wiki/Che_Kung_Temple \"Che Kung Temple\") to pray for his blessing. A\nrepresentative from the government asks [Che Kung](/wiki/Che_Kung \"Che Kung\")\nabout the city's fortune through [kau\ncim](/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government_Lunar_New_year_kau_cim_tradition \"Hong Kong\nGovernment Lunar New year kau cim tradition\").\n\n### Third day[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Third day\")]\n\nThe third day is known as \"red mouth\" (Chinese: 赤口; pinyin: _Chìkǒu_).\n_Chikou_ is also called \"Chigou's Day\" (Chinese: 赤狗日; pinyin: _Chìgǒurì_).\n_Chigou_ , literally \"red dog\", is an epithet of \"the God of Blazing Wrath\"\n(Chinese: 熛怒之神; pinyin: _Biāo nù zhī shén_). Rural villagers continue the\ntradition of burning paper offerings over trash fires. It is considered an\nunlucky day to have guests or go visiting.[42][43] Hakka villagers in rural\nHong Kong in the 1960s called it the Day of the Poor Devil and believed\neveryone should stay at home.[44] This is also considered a propitious day to\nvisit the temple of the God of Wealth and have one's future told.\n\n### Fourth\nday[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Fourth day\")]\n\nIn those communities that celebrate Chinese New Year for 15 days, the fourth\nday is when corporate \"spring dinners\" kick off and business returns to\nnormal. Other areas that have a longer Chinese New Year holiday will celebrate\nand welcome the gods that were previously sent on this day.\n\n### Fifth\nday[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit\nsection: Fifth day\")]\n\nThis day is the god of Wealth's birthday. In northern China, people eat\n[jiaozi](/wiki/Jiaozi \"Jiaozi\"), or dumplings, on the morning of _powu_\n(Chinese: 破五; pinyin: _pòwǔ_). In Taiwan, businesses traditionally re-open on\nthe next day (the sixth day), accompanied by firecrackers.\n\nIt is also common in China that on the 5th day people will shoot off\nfirecrackers to get [Guan Yu](/wiki/Guan_Yu \"Guan Yu\")'s attention, thus\nensuring his favor and good fortune for the new year.[45]\n\n### Seventh\nday[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Seventh day\")]\n\nMain article: [Renri](/wiki/Renri \"Renri\")\n\nThe seventh day, traditionally known as _[Renri](/wiki/Renri \"Renri\")_ (the\ncommon person's birthday), is the day when everyone grows one year older.

People normally return to work by the eighth\nday, therefore the Store owners will host a lunch/dinner with their employees,\nthanking their employees for the work they have done for the whole year.\n\nApproaching 12 midnight on this day, Hokkien people prepare for the \"Jade\nEmperor ritual\" ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien_dialect \"Hokkien dialect\"): _拜天公 Pài\nThiⁿ-kong_) during which incense is burnt and food offerings made to the Jade\nEmperor and also to Zao Jun, the Kitchen god who reports on each family to the\nJade Emperor.\n\nSome people will hold a ritual prayer after midnight on the eighth day. In\nMalaysia, especially, people light fireworks, often more than on the first\nday.\n\nThis practice of Bai Ti Gong can also be seen in Singapore and Indonesia,\nespecially in Hokkien-speaking Chinese areas like [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra\n\"Sumatra\").\n\n### Ninth\nday[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Ninth day\")]\n\nThe ninth day of the New Year is a day for Chinese to offer prayers to the\n[Jade Emperor](/wiki/Jade_Emperor \"Jade Emperor\") of Heaven in the\n[Daoist](/wiki/Taoist \"Taoist\") Pantheon.[46] The ninth day is traditionally\nthe birthday of the Jade Emperor. This day, called _Ti Kong Dan_\n([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien_dialect \"Hokkien dialect\"): _天公诞 Thiⁿ-kong Tan_), _Ti\nKong Si_ ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien_dialect \"Hokkien dialect\"): _天公生 Thiⁿ-kong\nSiⁿ_) or _Pai Ti Kong_ ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien_dialect \"Hokkien dialect\"):\n_拜天公 Pài Thiⁿ-kong_), is especially important to [Hokkiens](/wiki/Hoklo_people\n\"Hoklo people\"), even more important than the first day of the Chinese New\nYear.[47]\n\nCome midnight of the eighth day of the new year, Hokkiens will offer thanks to\nthe Emperor of Heaven. A prominent requisite offering is\n[sugarcane](/wiki/Sugarcane \"Sugarcane\").[47] Legend holds that the Hokkien\nwere spared from a massacre by Japanese pirates by hiding in a sugarcane\nplantation during the eighth and ninth days of the Chinese New Year,\ncoinciding with the Jade Emperor's birthday.[47] Since \"sugarcane\"\n([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien_dialect \"Hokkien dialect\"): _甘蔗 kam-chià_) is a near\nhomonym to \"thank you\" ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien_dialect \"Hokkien dialect\"):\n_感謝 kám-siā_) in the Hokkien dialect, Hokkiens offer sugarcane on the eve of\nhis birthday, symbolic of their gratitude.[47]\n\nIn the morning of this birthday (traditionally anytime from midnight to 7 am),\nTaiwanese households set up an altar table with 3 layers: one top (containing\noffertories of six vegetables (Chinese: 六齋; pinyin: _liù zhāi_), noodles,\nfruits, cakes, [tangyuan](/wiki/Tangyuan_\\(food\\) \"Tangyuan \\(food\\)\"),\nvegetable bowls, and unripe [betel](/wiki/Betel \"Betel\"), all decorated with\npaper lanterns) and two lower levels (containing the five sacrifices and\nwines) to honor the deities below the Jade Emperor.[46] The household then\nkneels three times and [kowtows](/wiki/Kowtow \"Kowtow\") nine times to pay\nobeisance and wish him a long life.[46]\n\nIncense, tea, fruit, vegetarian food or roast pig, and gold paper is served as\na customary protocol for paying respect to an honored person.\n\n### Tenth\nday[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Tenth day\")]\n\nThe Jade Emperor's party is celebrated on this day.\n\n### Fifteenth\nday[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit\nsection: Fifteenth day\")]\n\nThe fifteenth day of the new year is celebrated as \"_Yuanxiao_ Festival\"\n(simplified Chinese: 元宵节; traditional Chinese: 元宵節; pinyin: _Yuán xiāo jié_),\nalso known as \"_Shangyuan_ Festival\" (simplified Chinese: 上元节; traditional\nChinese: 上元節; pinyin: _Shàng yuán jié_) or the **[Lantern\nFestival](/wiki/Lantern_Festival \"Lantern Festival\")** (otherwise known as\n**Chap Goh Mei** Chinese: 十五暝; pinyin: _Shíwǔmíng_ ; literally: \"the fifteen\nnight\" in [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian \"Fujian\") dialect).

Most reunion dinners (particularly in the Southern regions) also\nprominently feature specialty meats (e.g. wax-cured meats like duck and\n[Chinese sausage](/wiki/Chinese_sausage \"Chinese sausage\")) and seafood (e.g.\nlobster and [abalone](/wiki/Abalone \"Abalone\")) that are usually reserved for\nthis and other special occasions during the remainder of the year. In most\nareas, fish (traditional Chinese: 魚; simplified Chinese: 鱼; pinyin: _yú_) is\nincluded, but not eaten completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as\nthe Chinese phrase \"may there be _surpluses_ every year\" (traditional Chinese:\n年年有餘; simplified Chinese: 年年有余; pinyin: _niánnián yǒu yú_) sounds the same as\n\"let there be _fish_ every year.\" Eight individual dishes are served to\nreflect the belief of good fortune associated with the number. If in the\nprevious year a death was experienced in the family, seven dishes are served.\n\n[Red packets](/wiki/Red_packet \"Red packet\") for the immediate family are\nsometimes distributed during the reunion dinner. These packets often contain\nmoney in certain numbers that reflect good luck and honorability. Several\nfoods are consumed to usher in wealth, happiness, and good fortune. Several of\nthe [Chinese food](/wiki/Chinese_cuisine \"Chinese cuisine\") names are\nhomophones for words that also mean good things.\n\nLike many other New Year dishes, certain ingredients also take special\nprecedence over others as these ingredients also have similar-sounding names\nwith prosperity, good luck, or even counting money.\n\nFood item | Description  \n---|---  \n[Buddha's delight](/wiki/Buddha%27s_delight \"Buddha's delight\") | An elaborate [vegetarian dish](/wiki/Buddhist_cuisine \"Buddhist cuisine\") served by Chinese families on the eve and the first day of the New Year. A type of black hair-like [algae](/wiki/Algae \"Algae\"), pronounced \"[fat choy](/wiki/Fat_choy_\\(vegetable\\) \"Fat choy \\(vegetable\\)\")\" in Cantonese, is also featured in the dish for its name, which sounds like \"prosperity\". [Hakkas](/wiki/Hakka_\\(language\\) \"Hakka \\(language\\)\") usually serve _kiu nyuk_ (Chinese: 扣肉; pinyin: _kòuròu_) and _[ngiong teu fu](/wiki/Yong_tau_foo \"Yong tau foo\")_.  \nChicken | Boiled chicken is served because it is figured that any family, no matter how humble their circumstances, can afford a chicken for Chinese New Year.  \nFish | Is usually eaten or merely displayed on the eve of Chinese New Year. The pronunciation of fish (魚yú) makes it a homophone for \"surpluses\"(餘yú).  \n[Leek](/wiki/Leek \"Leek\") | Is usually served in a dish with rondelles of Chinese sausage or Chinese cured meat during Chinese New Year. The pronunciation of leek (蒜苗/大蒜Suàn miáo/Dà suàn) makes it a homophone for \"calculating (money)\" (算Suàn). The Chinese cured meat is so chosen because it is traditionally the primary method for storing meat over the winter and the meat rondelles resemble coins.  \n[Jau gok](/wiki/Jau_gok \"Jau gok\") | The main Chinese new year dumpling for Cantonese families. It is believed to resemble a [sycee](/wiki/Sycee \"Sycee\") or _yuánbǎo_ , the old Chinese gold and silver [ingots](/wiki/Ingot \"Ingot\"), and to represent prosperity for the coming year.  \n[Jiaozi](/wiki/Jiaozi \"Jiaozi\") | The common dumpling eaten in [northern China](/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China \"Northern and southern China\"), also believed to resemble [sycee](/wiki/Sycee \"Sycee\").  \n[Mandarin oranges](/wiki/Mandarin_orange \"Mandarin orange\") | Oranges, particularly [mandarin oranges](/wiki/Mandarin_orange \"Mandarin orange\"), are a common fruit during Chinese New Year.

It symbolizes fertility and having many children.  \n[Niangao](/wiki/Nian_gao \"Nian gao\") | Most popular in eastern China ([Jiangsu](/wiki/Jiangsu \"Jiangsu\"), Zhejiang and Shanghai) because its pronunciation is a homophone for \"a more prosperous year (年高 lit. year high)\". Niangao is also popular in the Philippines because of its large Chinese population and is known as _tikoy_ (Chinese: 甜粿, from [Min Nan](/wiki/Min_Nan \"Min Nan\")) there. Known as Chinese New Year pudding, niangao is made up of glutinous rice flour, wheat starch, salt, water, and sugar. The color of the sugar used determines the color of the pudding (white or brown).  \n[Noodles](/wiki/Chinese_noodles \"Chinese noodles\") | Families may serve uncut noodles (making them as long as they can[50]), which represent longevity and long life, though this practice is not limited to the new year.  \nSweets | Sweets and similar dried fruit goods are stored in a red or black [Chinese candy box](/wiki/Chinese_candy_box \"Chinese candy box\").  \n[Rougan](/wiki/Rougan \"Rougan\") (Yok Gon) | Chinese salty-sweet dried meat, akin to jerky, which is trimmed of the fat, sliced, marinated and then smoked for later consumption or as a gift.  \n[Taro cakes](/wiki/Taro_cake \"Taro cake\") (Chinese: 芋頭糕, yùtougāo) | Made from the vegetable [taro](/wiki/Taro \"Taro\"), the cakes are cut into squares and often fried.  \n[Turnip cakes](/wiki/Turnip_cake \"Turnip cake\") (Chinese: 蘿蔔糕, luóbogāo) | A dish made of shredded radish and rice flour, usually fried and cut into small squares.  \n[Yusheng](/wiki/Yusheng \"Yusheng\") or Yee sang (traditional Chinese: 魚生; simplified Chinese: 鱼生; pinyin: _yúshēng_) | Raw fish salad. Eating this salad is said to bring good luck. This dish is usually eaten on the seventh day of the New Year, but may also be eaten throughout the period.  \n  \n## Practices[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Practices\")]\n\n### History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nIn 1928, the ruling [Kuomintang](/wiki/Kuomintang \"Kuomintang\") party in China\ndecreed that Chinese New Year will fall on 1 Jan of the Gregorian Calendar,\nbut this was abandoned due to overwhelming opposition from the populace. In\n1967 during the [Cultural Revolution](/wiki/Cultural_Revolution \"Cultural\nRevolution\"), official Chinese New Year celebrations were banned in China. The\nState Council of the People's Republic of China announced that the public\nshould \"Change Customs\", have a \"revolutionized and fighting Spring Festival\",\nand since people needed to work on Chinese New Year Eve, they didn't have\nholidays during Spring Festival day.

It is also common for adults or young couples to\ngive red packets to children.\n\nDuring this period, red packets are also known as 壓歲錢/压岁钱 (yàsuìqián, which\nwas evolved from 壓祟錢/压祟钱, literally, \"the money used to suppress or put down\nthe evil spirit\").[52]\n\nRed packets almost always contain money, usually varying from a couple of\ndollars to several hundred. Per custom, the amount of money in the red packets\nshould be of [even numbers](/wiki/Even_number \"Even number\"), as odd numbers\nare associated with cash given during funerals (帛金: báijīn). The number 8 is\nconsidered lucky (for its homophone for \"wealth\"), and $8 is commonly found in\nthe red envelopes in the US. The number six (六, liù) is also very lucky as it\nsounds like \"smooth\" (流, liú), in the sense of having a smooth year. The\nnumber four (四) is the worst because its homophone is \"death\" (死). Sometimes\nchocolate coins are found in the red packets.\n\nOdd and even numbers are determined by the first digit, rather than the last.\nThirty and fifty, for example, are odd numbers and are thus appropriate as\nfuneral cash gifts. However, it is common and quite acceptable to have cash\ngifts in a red packet using a single bank note – with ten or fifty\n[yuan](/wiki/Chinese_yuan \"Chinese yuan\") bills used frequently. It is\ncustomary for the bills to be brand new printed money. Everything regarding\nthe New Year has to be new in order to have good luck and fortune.\n\nThe act of asking for red packets is normally called (Mandarin): 讨紅包 tǎo-\nhóngbāo, 要利是 or (Cantonese): 逗利是. A married person would not turn down such a\nrequest as it would mean that he or she would be \"out of luck\" in the new\nyear. Red packets are generally given by established married couples to the\nyounger non-married children of the family. It is custom and polite for\nchildren to wish elders a happy new year and a year of happiness, health and\ngood fortune before accepting the red envelope. Red envelopes are then kept\nunder the pillow and slept on for seven nights after Chinese New Year before\nopening because that symbolizes good luck and fortune.\n\nIn Taiwan in the 2000s, some employers also gave red packets as a bonus to\n[maids](/wiki/Maid \"Maid\"), nurses or [domestic workers](/wiki/Domestic_worker\n\"Domestic worker\") from Southeast Asian countries, although whether this is\nappropriate is controversial.[53][54]\n\nThe Japanese have a similar tradition of giving money during the New Year,\ncalled [Otoshidama](/wiki/Otoshidama \"Otoshidama\").\n\n### Gift\nexchange[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Gift exchange\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Candy_Box.jpg/220px-\nCandy_Box.jpg)](/wiki/File:Candy_Box.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Candy_Box.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Chinese candy box](/wiki/Chinese_candy_box \"Chinese candy box\")\n\nIn addition to red envelopes, which are usually given from older people to\nyounger people, small gifts (usually food or sweets) are also exchanged\nbetween friends or relatives (of different households) during Chinese New\nYear. Gifts are usually brought when visiting friends or relatives at their\nhomes. Common gifts include fruits (typically oranges, but never trade pears),\ncakes, biscuits, chocolates, and candies.\n\nCertain items should not be given, as they are considered [taboo](/wiki/Taboo\n\"Taboo\"). Taboo gifts include:[55][56][57]\n\n  * items associated with [funerals](/wiki/Funerals \"Funerals\") (i.e. handkerchiefs, towels, [chrysanthemums](/wiki/Chrysanthemums \"Chrysanthemums\"), items colored white and black)\n  * items that show that time is running out (i.e. clocks and watches)\n  * sharp objects that symbolize cutting a tie (i.e. scissors and knives)\n  * items that symbolize that you want to walk away from a relationship (examples: shoes and sandals)\n  * mirrors\n  * [homonyms](/wiki/Homonyms \"Homonyms\") for unpleasant topics (examples: \"clock\" sounds like \"the funeral ritual\", green hats because \"wear a green hat\" sounds like \"[cuckold](/wiki/Cuckold \"Cuckold\")\", \"handkerchief\" sounds like \"goodbye\", \"pear\" sounds like \"separate\", and \"umbrella\" sounds like \"disperse\").\n\n### Markets[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: Markets\")]\n\nMarkets or village fairs are set up as the New Year is approaching. These\nusually open-air markets feature new year related products such as flowers,\ntoys, clothing, and even fireworks and firecrackers. It is convenient for\npeople to buy gifts for their new year visits as well as their home\ndecorations. In some places, the practice of shopping for the perfect [plum\ntree](/wiki/Prunus_mume \"Prunus mume\") is not dissimilar to the Western\ntradition of buying a [Christmas tree](/wiki/Christmas_tree \"Christmas tree\").\n\n[Hong Kong filmmakers](/wiki/Cinema_of_Hong_Kong \"Cinema of Hong Kong\") also\nrelease \"New Year celebration films\" (賀歲片), mostly comedies, at this time of\nyear.\n\n###\nFireworks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=23\n\"Edit section: Fireworks\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Chinesenewyearfireworkman.jpg/220px-\nChinesenewyearfireworkman.jpg)](/wiki/File:Chinesenewyearfireworkman.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Chinesenewyearfireworkman.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA Chinese man setting off fireworks during Chinese New Year in Shanghai.\n\nBamboo stems filled with gunpowder that was burnt to create small explosions\nwere once used in ancient China to drive away evil spirits. In modern times,\nthis method has eventually evolved into the use of\n[firecrackers](/wiki/Firecrackers \"Firecrackers\") during the festive season.\nFirecrackers are usually strung on a long fused string so it can be hung down.\nEach firecracker is rolled up in red papers, as red is auspicious, with\ngunpowder in its core. Once ignited, the firecracker lets out a loud popping\nnoise and, as they are usually strung together by the hundreds, the\nfirecrackers are known for their deafening explosions that are thought to\nscare away evil spirits. The burning of firecrackers also signifies a joyful\ntime of year and has become an integral aspect of Chinese New Year\ncelebrations.[58]\n\n#### Firecracker\nban[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit\nsection: Firecracker ban\")]\n\nThe use of [firecrackers](/wiki/Firecracker \"Firecracker\"), although a\ntraditional part of the celebration, has over the years led to many\nunfortunate outcomes. There have been reported incidents every year of users\nof fireworks being blinded, losing body parts, or suffering other grievous\ninjuries, especially during the Chinese New Year season. But, many governments\nand authorities eventually enacted laws completely banning the use of\nfirecrackers privately, primarily because of safety issues.\n\n  * Taiwan – Beginning 2008, firecrackers are banned in urban areas, but still allowed in rural areas.\n  * [Mainland China](/wiki/Mainland_China \"Mainland China\") – As of 2008, most urban areas in mainland China permit firecrackers. In the first three days of the traditional New Year, it is a tradition that people compete with each other by playing with firecrackers. However, many urban areas banned them in the 1990s. For example, they were banned in Beijing's [urban districts](/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_of_Beijing \"List of administrative divisions of Beijing\") from 1993 to 2005.[59] In 2004, 37 people were killed in a stampede when four million[60] people gathered for a rumoured [Lantern Festival](/wiki/Lantern_Festival \"Lantern Festival\") firework display in nearby [Miyun](/wiki/Miyun \"Miyun\").[61] Since the ban was lifted, the firecracker barrage has been tremendous. In Beijing, firecrackers are typically not allowed inside the 5th ring road. But this is overlooked by authorities for the holiday, provided there are no government buildings nearby; some residents in major cities look down on street-level fireworks from their tower blocks. Bans are rare in rural areas.\n  * Vietnam – 1996, fireworks were banned across the country because of its dangers.\n  * Hong Kong – [Fireworks](/wiki/Fireworks \"Fireworks\") are banned for security reasons – some speculate a connection between firework use and the [1967 Leftist Riot](/wiki/Hong_Kong_1967_Leftist_Riots \"Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots\"). However, the government would put on a fireworks display in [Victoria Harbour](/wiki/Victoria_Harbour \"Victoria Harbour\") on the second day of the Chinese New Year for the public. Similar displays are also held in many other cities in and outside China.\n  * Singapore – a partial ban on firecrackers was imposed in March 1970 after a fire killed six people and injured 68.[62] This was extended to a total ban in August 1972, after an explosion that killed two people[63] and an attack on two police officers attempting to stop a group from letting off firecrackers in February 1972.[64] As a result of this ban, the [Chingay Parade](/wiki/Chingay_Parade_\\(South_East_Asia\\)#Chingay_in_Singapore \"Chingay Parade \\(South East Asia\\)\") was set up to preserve the spirit and culture. However, in 2003, the [government](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore \"Government of Singapore\") allowed firecrackers to be set off during the festive season. At the Chinese New Year light-up in [Chinatown](/wiki/Chinatown,_Singapore \"Chinatown, Singapore\"), at the stroke of midnight on the first day of the Chinese New Year, firecrackers are set off under controlled conditions by the [Singapore Tourism Board](/wiki/Singapore_Tourism_Board \"Singapore Tourism Board\") with assistance from demolition experts from the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Army \"Singapore Army\"). Other occasions where firecrackers are allowed to be set off are determined by the [tourism board](/wiki/Singapore_Tourism_Board \"Singapore Tourism Board\") or other government organizations. However, they are not allowed to be commercially sold.\n  * Malaysia – firecrackers are banned for the similar reasons as in Singapore. However, many Malaysians manage to smuggle them from Thailand and the Philippines to meet their private needs.\n  * Indonesia – Firecrackers and fireworks are forbidden in public during the Chinese New Year, especially in areas with a significant non-Chinese population in order to avoid any conflict between the two. However, there were some exceptions. The usage of firecrackers is legal in some metropolitan areas such as [Jakarta](/wiki/Jakarta \"Jakarta\") and [Medan](/wiki/Medan \"Medan\"), where the degree of racial and cultural tolerance is higher.\n  * United States – In 2007, New York City lifted its decades-old ban on firecrackers, allowing a display of 300,000 firecrackers to be set off in [Chinatown](/wiki/Chinatown,_Manhattan \"Chinatown, Manhattan\")'s [Chatham Square](/wiki/Chatham_Square_\\(Manhattan\\) \"Chatham Square \\(Manhattan\\)\").[65] Under the supervision of the [fire](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Fire_Department \"Los Angeles Fire Department\") and [police](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department \"Los Angeles Police Department\") departments, [Chinatown, Los Angeles](/wiki/Chinatown,_Los_Angeles \"Chinatown, Los Angeles\") regularly lights firecrackers every New Year's Eve, mostly at temples and the shrines of benevolent associations. The San Francisco Chinese New Year Parade, the largest outside China, is accompanied by numerous firecrackers, both officially sanctioned and illicit.\n  * Australia – Australia, except the [Northern Territory](/wiki/Northern_Territory \"Northern Territory\"), does not allow use of fireworks at all, except when used by a licensed [pyrotechnician](/wiki/Pyrotechnician \"Pyrotechnician\"). These rules also need a permit from local government, and from any relevant local bodies such as maritime or aviation authorities (as relevant to the types of fireworks being used) and hospitals, schools, etc., within a certain range.\n  * Philippines – Despite the rise in firecracker-related injuries in 2009, the Department of Health has acknowledged that a total ban on firecrackers in the country will be hard to implement. [Davao City](/wiki/Davao_City \"Davao City\"), the first city in the country to impose a firecracker ban, has enjoyed injury-free celebrations for at least the last 15 years.

One common example of Chinese New Year\nsymbolism is the red diamond-shaped _[fu characters](/wiki/Fu_character \"Fu\ncharacter\")_ (Chinese: 福; pinyin: _fú_ ; Cantonese Yale: _fuk1_ ; literally:\n\"blessings, happiness\"), which are displayed on the entrances of Chinese\nhomes. This sign is usually seen hanging upside down, since the Chinese word\n_dao_ (Chinese: 倒; pinyin: _dào_ ; literally: \"upside down\"), is\n[homophonous](/wiki/Homophone \"Homophone\") or nearly homophonous with\n(Chinese: 到; pinyin: _dào_ ; literally: \"arrive\") in all [varieties of\nChinese](/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese \"Varieties of Chinese\"). Therefore, it\nsymbolizes the arrival of luck, happiness, and prosperity.\n\nFor the [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese \"Cantonese\")-speaking people, if the _fu_\nsign is hung upside down, the implied _dao_ (upside down) sounds like the\nCantonese word for \"pour\", producing \"pour the luck [away]\", which would\nusually symbolize bad luck; this is why the _fu_ character is not usually hung\nupside-down in Cantonese communities.\n\nRed is the predominant color used in New Year celebrations. Red is the emblem\nof joy, and this color also symbolizes virtue, truth and sincerity. On the\nChinese opera stage, a painted red face usually denotes a sacred or loyal\npersonage and sometimes a great emperor. Candies, cakes, decorations and many\nthings associated with the New Year and its ceremonies are colored red. The\nsound of the Chinese word for \"red\" (simplified Chinese: 红; traditional\nChinese: 紅; pinyin: _hóng_ ; Cantonese Yale: _hung4_) is in\n[Mandarin](/wiki/Standard_Chinese \"Standard Chinese\") homophonous with the\nword for \"prosperous\".

This\nrestriction is made by Indonesian government through a Presidential\nInstruction, _Instruksi Presiden No.14 Tahun 1967_ , signed by President\n[Suharto](/wiki/Suharto \"Suharto\"). This restriction is ended when the regime\nhas changed and the President [Suharto](/wiki/Suharto \"Suharto\") was\noverthrown.[85] The celebration is conducted unofficially by Chinese community\nfrom 1999 to 2000. On 17 January 2000, the President [Abdurrahman\nWahid](/wiki/Abdurrahman_Wahid \"Abdurrahman Wahid\") issued a Presidential\nDecree through _Keputusan Presiden RI No 6 Tahun 2000_ to annul _Instruksi\nPresiden No.14 Tahun 1967._[86] On 19 January 2001, the Ministry of Religious\nAffairs (_Kementerian Agama Republik Indonesia_) issued a Decree through\n_Keputusan Menteri Agama RI No 13 Tahun 2001 tentang Imlek sebagai Hari Libur\nNasional_ to set of _Hari Tahun Baru Imlek_ as a Facultative Holiday for\nChinese Community _._[77][87] Through the Presidential Decree it was\nofficially declared as a 1 (one) day public religious holiday as of 9 April\n2002 by President [Megawati](/wiki/Megawati_Sukarnoputri \"Megawati\nSukarnoputri\").[79] The Indonesian government authorize only the first day of\nthe Chinese New Year as a public religious holiday and it is specifically\ndesignated only for Chinese people.[77][78][79][81][82][88][89] In Indonesia,\nthe first day of the Chinese New Year is recognized as a part of the\ncelebration of the Chinese religion and tradition of Chinese\ncommunity.[78][79][81][82][87] There are no other official or unofficial of\nthe Chinese New Year as a public holiday. The remaining 14 days are celebrated\nonly by ethnic Chinese families.[77][90] In Indonesia, the Chinese Year is\nnamed as a year of _Kǒngzǐ_ (孔子) or _Kongzili_ in Bahasa Indonesia. Every\nyear, the Ministry of Religious Affairs (_Kementerian Agama Republik\nIndonesia_) set the specific date of religious holiday based on input from\nreligious leaders.[90] The Chinese New Year is the only national religious\nholiday in Indonesia that was enacted specifically with the Presidential\nDecree, in this case with the _Keputusan Presiden Republik Indonesia (Keppres\nRI) No 19 Tahun 2002_ dated on 9 April 2002.[78][79] The celebration of the\nChinese New Year as a religious holiday is specifically intended only for\nChinese People in Indonesia (_tradisi masyarakat Cina yang dirayakan secara\nturun temurun di berbagai wilayah di Indonesia,_[79] _dan umat Agama\nTionghoa_[81]) and it is not intended to be celebrated by Indonesian\nIndigenous Peoples or _Masyarakat Pribumi Indonesia_.[78][79][81][82][83][87]\n\nOddly and funny, most [Chinese-Indonesian](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesians \"Chinese\nIndonesians\") who are not adhere to [Chinese\nreligion](/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion \"Chinese folk religion\") thinks and\nbelieves that the Chinese New Year is only for one day, in this case is on the\nfirst day, and the remaining day especially on the fifteenth day is not\nconsidered as a part of Chinese New Year. The same things is happening to\nIndonesian Indigenous peoples who insists that the fifteenth day of the\nChinese New Year is a kind of [jamboree](/wiki/Jamboree_\\(Scouting\\) \"Jamboree\n\\(Scouting\\)\") or [carnival](/wiki/Carnival \"Carnival\") and thinks it has not\nrelated with Chinese New Year at all. It is believed that this behaviour\noccurs because of the religion dilemma where mostly a majority of Indigenous\npeoples in Indonesia are religious thus by denying that the Chinese New Year\nactivities are not related with any of religion then they can make a\njustification to participate and celebrate the Chinese New Year especially on\nthe fifteenth day of the celebration. Their primary motives to participate the\nChinese New Year festival and Chinese religion activities are money from\ncarrying the Chinese gods statues, playing the lion and dragon dance and free\nfoods, and the opportunity to meet and seeking a Chinese partner for\nmarriages. Some are even trying to find a mate to have a sexual intercourse\nduring the festival. A large number of Non-Chinese men are even continue to\ncome to the Chinese temple on a regular basis to pray to the [Chinese\ndeities](/wiki/Chinese_deities \"Chinese deities\") and wishing to get for an\nethnic Chinese woman as a wife. Some have succeed in marrying with ethnic\nChinese. Sadly, all of the descendant of this mix-marriages claim that they\nhave a pure blood of Chinese descendant. By marrying a Chinese, and actively\nparticipate as a follower of Chinese religion and thus to get into the deep of\nthe inside environment of ethnic Chinese family inner-circle, the Non-Chinese\npeople believed that they can upgrade their social and financial status\ninstantly. To disguise their identity many changed their Indonesian name into\nChinese look-alike name and falsified their ancestral history family tree. A\nlot of Non-Chinese people who have married also put in their children to\nChinese temple[91] and Chinese school with the hope that as they grow-up they\nhave the first opportunity to marry with the Chinese. After marrying with\nChinese people, most of the Non-Chinese people, if not all, including their\nchildren are always claiming and insists that they have a pure blood of a\nChinese descendant, consequently, mostly, if not all, the Chinese people\nitself in Indonesia, because of lack of comparisons, can not differentiate who\nis a Chinese and who is not.[92][93] Furthermore, because of this ignorance,\nmore and more of Chinese people in Indonesia thinks they are already marrying\nwith a Chinese because they have met at the Chinese temple. They assume that\nonly Chinese people goes to the Chinese temple, but the truth is not. No\nwonder that at least 90%, if not all, of [Chinese-\nIndonesian](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesians \"Chinese Indonesians\") who claimed that\nthey have a pure blood of Chinese have a very different skin complexion, and a\ndifferent physical characteristics with an odd facial features compares with\nthe other Chinese people in the world. Everyone even want to claim that they\nare a Chinese descendant even though their [DNA](/wiki/DNA \"DNA\") is not a\nChinese at all. This phenomenon explains why there are crowds on every Chinese\nNew Year events and roughly 90% of Chinese temple visitors in some places are\nIndonesian Indigenous peoples and a descendant of a mix-marriages even though\nthe Chinese community only accounted for 1,2 %,[94] of Indonesian population.\nSome of Non-Chinese and Chinese people are also celebrated Chinese New Year\ninside a Church with dragon dance, incense for praying and food offerings to\n[Mary, Mother of Jesus](/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus \"Mary, mother of Jesus\")\nand [Jesus Christ](/wiki/Jesus \"Jesus\").[95][96][97] Because of the majority\nof Chinese temple congregation are Non-Chinese people, consequently they are\nalso bringing their own culture, customs, beliefs and ritual of worship of\ntheir gods to be practiced inside the Chinese temple,[98][99] thus in some\nparts of Indonesia the practice of Chinese religion and Chinese New Year would\nbe totally different with the other Chinese community in the other parts of\nthe world.[91][100][101][102][103][104][105] Some of Non-Chinese people who\nhave a deep knowledge of Chinese religion is becoming the Chinese religious\nleaders and routinely gives preaching to Chinese community. Some are even\nbecoming the chairman and the leaders of the Chinese religious\nassociation.[106][107] There are tons of evidence supporting the above\nstatements, anyone who want to pursue further about this matter is encouraged\nto go to Facebook.com and do research using the keywords, such as: kelenteng\nindonesia, klenteng indonesia, bio indonesia, vihara indonesia and to study\ncarefully in detail about the social changes of the Chinese community in\nIndonesia especially in relation with the identity as a Chinese, the practice\nof Chinese religion and the practice of Chinese New Year celebration.\n\nBig Chinese population cities and towns like [Jakarta](/wiki/Jakarta\n\"Jakarta\"), [Medan](/wiki/Medan \"Medan\"), [Singkawang](/wiki/Singkawang\n\"Singkawang\"), [Pangkal Pinang](/wiki/Pangkal_Pinang \"Pangkal Pinang\"),\n[Binjai](/wiki/Binjai \"Binjai\"), [Bagansiapiapi](/wiki/Bagansiapiapi\n\"Bagansiapiapi\"), [Tanjungbalai](/wiki/Tanjungbalai_\\(Town\\) \"Tanjungbalai\n\\(Town\\)\"), [Pematangsiantar](/wiki/Pematangsiantar \"Pematangsiantar\"), [Selat\nPanjang](/wiki/Selat_Panjang \"Selat Panjang\"), [Tanjung\nPinang](/wiki/Tanjung_Pinang \"Tanjung Pinang\"), [Batam](/wiki/Batam \"Batam\"),\n[Ketapang](/wiki/Ketapang \"Ketapang\") and\n[Pontianak](/wiki/Pontianak,_Indonesia \"Pontianak, Indonesia\") always have its\nown New Year's celebration every years with parade and fireworks.

In [Kolkata](/wiki/Kolkata \"Kolkata\"), Chinese New Year is\ncelebrated with lion and dragon dance.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Chinese New Year is also celebrated among the sizable\n[Chinese expatriate community](/wiki/Chinese_people_in_Pakistan \"Chinese\npeople in Pakistan\") that lives in the country. During the festival, the\nChinese embassy in Islamabad arranges various cultural events in which\nPakistani arts and cultural organizations and members of the civil society\nalso participate.[132][133][134][135]\n\n## Greetings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=42\n\"Edit section: Greetings\")]\n\nThe Chinese New Year is often accompanied by loud, enthusiastic greetings,\noften referred to as 吉祥話 (_jíxiánghuà_) in Mandarin or 吉利說話 (Kat Lei Seut Wa)\nin Cantonese, loosely translated as _auspicious words or phrases_. New Year\ncouplets printed in gold letters on bright red paper, referred to as\n_chunlian_ (春聯) or _[fai chun](/wiki/Fai_chun \"Fai chun\")_ (揮春), is another\nway of expressing auspicious new year wishes. They probably predate the [Ming\ndynasty](/wiki/Ming_dynasty \"Ming dynasty\") (1368–1644), but did not become\nwidespread until then.[136] Today, they are ubiquitous with Chinese New Year.\n\nSome of the most common greetings include:\n\n  * [simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters \"Simplified Chinese characters\"): 新年快乐; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters \"Traditional Chinese characters\"): 新年快樂; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin \"Pinyin\"): _Xīnniánkuàilè_ ; [Jyutping](/wiki/Jyutping \"Jyutping\"): _san1 nin4 faai3 lok6_ ; [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB \"Pe̍h-ōe-jī\"): _Sin-nî khòai-lo̍k_ ; [Hakka](/wiki/Hakka \"Hakka\"): Sin Ngen Kai Lok; [Taishanese](/wiki/Taishanese \"Taishanese\"): Slin Nen Fai Lok. A more contemporary greeting reflective of Western influences, it literally translates from the greeting \"Happy new year\" more common in the west. But in northern parts of China, traditionally people say simplified Chinese: 过年好; traditional Chinese: 過年好; pinyin: _Guònián Hǎo_ instead of simplified Chinese: 新年快乐; traditional Chinese: 新年快樂 (Xīnniánkuàile), to differentiate it from the international new year. And 過年好 (Guònián Hǎo) can be used from the first day to the fifth day of Chinese New Year. However, 過年好 (Guònián Hǎo) is considered very short and therefore somewhat discourteous.  \n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Kung_Hei_Fat_Choi_at_Lee_Theatre_Plaza.jpg/220px-\nKung_Hei_Fat_Choi_at_Lee_Theatre_Plaza.jpg)](/wiki/File:Kung_Hei_Fat_Choi_at_Lee_Theatre_Plaza.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Kung_Hei_Fat_Choi_at_Lee_Theatre_Plaza.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n_Gong Hei Fat Choi_ at Lee Theatre Plaza, Hong Kong\n\n  * simplified Chinese: 恭喜发财; traditional Chinese: 恭喜發財; pinyin: _Gōngxǐfācái_ ; [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien \"Hokkien\"): Kiong hee huat chai ([POJ](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB \"Pe̍h-ōe-jī\"): Kiong-hí hoat-châi); [Cantonese](/wiki/Jyutping \"Jyutping\"): Gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4; [Hakka](/wiki/Hakka_\\(language\\) \"Hakka \\(language\\)\"): Gung hee fatt choi, which _loosely_ translates to \"Congratulations and be prosperous\". Often mistakenly assumed to be synonymous with \"Happy New Year\", its usage dates back several centuries. While the first two words of this phrase had a much longer historical significance (legend has it that the congratulatory messages were traded for surviving the ravaging beast of _[Nian](/wiki/Nian \"Nian\")_ , in practical terms it may also have meant surviving the harsh winter conditions), the last two words were added later as ideas of capitalism and [consumerism](/wiki/Consumerism \"Consumerism\") became more significant in Chinese societies around the world.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The saying is now commonly heard in English speaking communities for greetings during Chinese New Year in parts of the world where there is a sizable Chinese-speaking community, including [overseas Chinese](/wiki/Overseas_Chinese \"Overseas Chinese\") communities that have been resident for several generations, relatively recent immigrants from [Greater China](/wiki/Greater_China \"Greater China\"), and those who are transit migrants (particularly students).\n\nNumerous other greetings exist, some of which may be exclaimed out loud to no\none in particular in specific situations. For example, as breaking objects\nduring the new year is considered inauspicious, one may then say 歲歲平安\n(_Suìsuì-píng 'ān_) immediately, which means \"everlasting peace year after\nyear\". _Suì_ (歲), meaning \"age\" is homophonous with 碎 (suì) (meaning\n\"shatter\"), in the demonstration of the Chinese love for wordplay in\nauspicious phrases. Similarly, 年年有餘 (_niánnián yǒu yú_), a wish for surpluses\nand bountiful harvests every year, plays on the word _yú_ that can also refer\nto 魚 (yú meaning fish), making it a catch phrase for fish-based Chinese new\nyear dishes and for paintings or graphics of fish that are hung on walls or\npresented as gifts.\n\nThe most common auspicious greetings and sayings consist of four characters,\nsuch as the following:\n\n  * 金玉滿堂 _Jīnyùmǎntáng_ – \"May your wealth [gold and jade] come to fill a hall\"\n  * 大展鴻圖 _Dàzhǎnhóngtú_ – \"May you realize your ambitions\"\n  * 迎春接福 _Yíngchúnjiēfú_ – \"Greet the New Year and encounter happiness\"\n  * 萬事如意 _Wànshìrúyì_ – \"May all your wishes be fulfilled\"\n  * 吉慶有餘 _Jíqìngyǒuyú_ – \"May your happiness be without limit\"\n  * 竹報平安 _Zhúbàopíng 'ān_ – \"May you hear [in a letter] that all is well\"\n  * 一本萬利 _Yīběnwànlì_ – \"May a small investment bring ten-thousandfold profits\"\n  * 福壽雙全 _Fúshòushuāngquán_ – \"May your happiness and longevity be complete\"\n  * 招財進寶 _Zhāocáijìnbǎo_ – \"When wealth is acquired, precious objects follow\"[137]\n\nThese greetings or phrases may also be used just before children receive their\nred packets, when gifts are exchanged, when visiting temples, or even when\ntossing the shredded ingredients of [yusheng](/wiki/Yusheng \"Yusheng\")\nparticularly popular in Malaysia and Singapore. Children and their parents can\nalso pray in the temple, in hopes of getting good blessings for the new year\nto come.\n\nChildren and teenagers sometimes jokingly use the phrase 恭喜發財,紅包拿來 (in\nTraditional Chinese; Simplified Chinese: 恭喜发财，红包拿来; [Pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin\n\"Pinyin\"): gōngxǐfācái, hóngbāo nálái; Cantonese: 恭喜發財,利是逗來; Jyutping: gung1\nhei2 faat3 coi4, lei6 si6 dau6 loi4), roughly translated as \"Congratulations\nand be prosperous, now give me a red envelope!\". In [Hakka](/wiki/Hakka\n\"Hakka\") the saying is more commonly said as 'Gung hee fatt choi, hung bao diu\nloi' which would be written as 恭喜發財,紅包逗來 – a mixture of the Cantonese and\nMandarin variants of the saying.\n\nBack in the 1960s, children in Hong Kong used to say 恭喜發財,利是逗來,斗零唔愛\n(Cantonese, Gung Hei Fat Choy, Lai Si Tau Loi, Tau Ling M Ngoi), which was\nrecorded in the pop song [Kowloon Hong\nKong](/w/index.php?title=Kowloon_Hong_Kong&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Kowloon Hong\nKong \\(page does not exist\\)\") by\n[Reynettes](/w/index.php?title=Reynettes&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Reynettes\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") in 1966. Later in the 1970s, children in Hong Kong\nused the saying: 恭喜發財,利是逗來,伍毫嫌少,壹蚊唔愛 (Cantonese), roughly translated as,\n\"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope, fifty cents is\ntoo little, don't want a dollar either.\" It basically meant that they disliked\nsmall change – coins which were called \"hard substance\" (Cantonese: 硬嘢).\nInstead, they wanted \"soft substance\" (Cantonese: 軟嘢), which was either a ten\ndollar or a twenty dollar note.\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=43\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Overseas Chinese](/wiki/Overseas_Chinese \"Overseas Chinese\")\n  * [Lunar New Year fireworks display in Hong Kong](/wiki/Lunar_New_Year_fireworks_display_in_Hong_Kong \"Lunar New Year fireworks display in Hong Kong\")\n  * [The Birthday of Che Kung](/wiki/The_Birthday_of_Che_Kung \"The Birthday of Che Kung\")\n  * Celebrations of Lunar New Year in other parts of Asia: \n    * [Korean New Year](/wiki/Korean_New_Year \"Korean New Year\") _(Seollal)_\n    * [Japanese New Year](/wiki/Japanese_New_Year \"Japanese New Year\") _(Shōgatsu)_\n    * [Mongolian New Year](/wiki/Tsagaan_Sar \"Tsagaan Sar\") _(Tsagaan Sar)_\n    * [Tibetan New Year](/wiki/Losar \"Losar\") _(Losar)_\n    * [Vietnamese New Year](/wiki/T%E1%BA%BFt \"Tết\") _(Tết)_\n  * Similar Asian Lunisolar New Year celebrations that occur in April: \n    * [Burmese New Year](/wiki/Thingyan \"Thingyan\") _(Thingyan)_\n    * [Cambodian New Year](/wiki/Cambodian_New_Year \"Cambodian New Year\") _(Chaul Chnam Thmey)_\n    * [Lao New Year](/wiki/Songkran_\\(Lao\\) \"Songkran \\(Lao\\)\") _(Pii Mai)_\n    * [Sri Lankan New Year](/wiki/Sinhalese_New_Year \"Sinhalese New Year\") _(Aluth Avuruddu)_\n    * [Thai New Year](/wiki/Songkran_\\(Thailand\\) \"Songkran \\(Thailand\\)\") _(Songkran)_\n  * Chinese New Year Gregorian Holiday in Malaysia \n    * Malaysia Chinese New Year\n\n## Notes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=44\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters \"Simplified Chinese characters\"): 农历新年; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters \"Traditional Chinese characters\"): 農曆新年; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin \"Pinyin\"): _nóng lì xīn nián_\n  2. **Jump up ^** [simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters \"Simplified Chinese characters\"): 春节; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters \"Traditional Chinese characters\"): 春節; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin \"Pinyin\"): _Chūn Jié_\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Chinese_New_Year&action=edit&section=45\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"Asia welcomes lunar New Year\"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2712567.stm).
