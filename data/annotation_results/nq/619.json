It is the [third highest-\ngrossing film of 2018](/wiki/2018_in_film#Highest-grossing_films \"2018 in\nfilm\") and the [12th highest-grossing film of all time](/wiki/List_of_highest-\ngrossing_films \"List of highest-grossing films\").

After successfully collecting a bone\nfragment, the team's survivors barely escape the island following attacks by\nthe _[Mosasaurus](/wiki/Mosasaurus \"Mosasaurus\")_ and _[Tyrannosaurus\nrex](/wiki/Tyrannosaurus \"Tyrannosaurus\")_.\n\nThree years later in 2018, a [U.S. Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United\nStates Senate\") hearing in [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C.\n\"Washington, D.C.\") debates whether Isla Nublar's dinosaurs should be saved\nfrom an impending volcanic eruption. Mathematician [Dr. Ian\nMalcolm](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Ian_Malcolm \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") testifies that the dinosaurs should be allowed to\nperish to correct [John\nHammond's](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#John_Hammond \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") mistake of [cloning](/wiki/Cloning \"Cloning\") them.\nMeanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager Claire Dearing has\nestablished the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the\nSenate rules against rescuing the dinosaurs, Hammond's former partner,\n[Benjamin\nLockwood](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Sir_Benjamin_Lockwood \"List\nof Jurassic Park characters\"), summons Claire Dearing to his [Northern\nCalifornia](/wiki/Northern_California \"Northern California\") estate. Lockwood\nand his aide, [Eli Mills](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Eli_Mills\n\"List of Jurassic Park characters\"), reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs\nto a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to help reactivate the park's\ndinosaur [tracking system](/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking \"GPS wildlife\ntracking\") to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last living\n_[Velociraptor](/wiki/Velociraptor \"Velociraptor\")_. Although they are\nestranged, Claire recruits Jurassic World's former _Velociraptor_ trainer and\nBlue's alpha, Owen Grady, to help capture her.\n\nOn Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician [Franklin\nWebb](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Franklin_Webb \"List of Jurassic\nPark characters\") get the [tracking system](/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking \"GPS\nwildlife tracking\") online. Owen, paleo-veterinarian [Zia\nRodriguez](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Zia_Rodriguez \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\"), and a mercenary team led by [Ken\nWheatley](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Ken_Wheatley \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") search for Blue. On finding her, the encounter\nescalates, resulting in a mercenary shooting Blue and Wheatley\n[tranquilizing](/wiki/Sedative \"Sedative\") Owen. The mercenaries take Zia so\nshe can treat Blue's injury. Their ship departs for the [U.S.\nmainland](/wiki/Contiguous_United_States \"Contiguous United States\") as the\nanimals left behind die in the eruption. Claire, Franklin, and Owen sneak\naboard in time and assist Zia in [transfusing](/wiki/Blood_transfusion \"Blood\ntransfusion\") Blue with _Tyrannosaurus_ blood. The group now realize the\ncaptured dinosaurs were never being transported to a new island and are for\nanother purpose.\n\nBack at the estate, Lockwood's orphaned pre-teen granddaughter\n[Maisie](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Maisie_Lockwood \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") overhears Mills and auctioneer [Gunnar\nEversol](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Gunnar_Eversol \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\") secretly planning to auction the captured dinosaurs\non the [black market](/wiki/Black_market \"Black market\"). They will also\nunveil the\n_[Indoraptor](/wiki/List_of_cloned_animals_in_the_Jurassic_Park_series#Indoraptor\n\"List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park series\")_ , a new [genetically-\nengineered](/wiki/Genetic_engineering \"Genetic engineering\") dinosaur created\nby geneticist [Dr. Henry\nWu](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Henry_Wu \"List of Jurassic Park\ncharacters\") using _Indominus rex_ and _Velociraptor_ DNA. Wu wants Blue's DNA\nto create an enhanced _Indoraptor_ , unaware that Blue's blood is\ncontaminated. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts\nMills, who murders him. Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from\nLockwood's deceased daughter and is the reason John Hammond, who opposed\n[human cloning](/wiki/Human_cloning \"Human cloning\"), ended their partnership.\n\nThe dinosaurs are transported to Lockwood's estate and caged. Zia and Franklin\nevade capture, but Owen and Claire are apprehended and confined. Owen incites\na _[Stygimoloch](/wiki/Stygimoloch \"Stygimoloch\")_ into breaking open their\ncell. They find Maisie who leads them to the auction where the _Indoraptor_ is\nbeing sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the\nproceedings by luring the _Stygimoloch_ into the room. In the ensuing chaos,\nWheatley tranquilizes the _Indoraptor_ to extract a tooth as a trophy, but it\nfeigns sedation and escapes, killing him, Eversol, and others. The\n_Indoraptor_ hunts Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion. Zia\nreleases Blue, who attacks the _Indoraptor_ , causing it to fall through a\nglass roof to its death.\n\nWhen a [hydrogen cyanide](/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide \"Hydrogen cyanide\") gas leak\nthreatens the caged animals, Maisie is unable to let them die and frees them\ndespite Owen's warning. Mills is killed and the _Indominus_ bone is destroyed\nby the _Tyrannosaurus_. Owen, Claire, Maisie, Zia, and Franklin get away\nsafely, while Blue and the other dinosaurs escape.\n\nIn a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning of a Neo-\nJurassic Age where humans and dinosaurs must learn to coexist. The closing\nscenes show the freed dinosaurs roaming wilderness and outer urban areas.\n\n## Cast\n\nMain article: [List of Jurassic Park\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters \"List of Jurassic Park\ncharacters\")\n\n  * [Chris Pratt](/wiki/Chris_Pratt \"Chris Pratt\") as Owen Grady: A [Navy](/wiki/United_States_Navy \"United States Navy\") veteran and former _Velociraptor_ handler for Jurassic World.[11]\n  * [Bryce Dallas Howard](/wiki/Bryce_Dallas_Howard \"Bryce Dallas Howard\") as Claire Dearing: Jurassic World's former [operations manager](/wiki/Operations_management \"Operations management\"), now a dinosaur-rights [activist](/wiki/Activism \"Activism\"), who has founded the Dinosaur Protection Group in [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\") to save Isla Nublar's surviving dinosaurs.[11][12]\n  * [Rafe Spall](/wiki/Rafe_Spall \"Rafe Spall\") as Eli Mills:   \nLockwood's ambitious assistant who recruits Owen and Claire to rescue the\ndinosaurs. Speaking of his character’s actions over the course of the film,\nSpall noted that, \"Ambition is such a powerful emotion, you can get wrapped up\nin it and end up doing things in order to succeed. This character believes he\nis doing right. He has been entrusted with pushing Lockwood’s fortune into the\nfuture and making it survive after he dies. Mills feels he is simply doing\nwhat he was asked to do.\"[13][3]\n\n  * [Justice Smith](/wiki/Justice_Smith \"Justice Smith\") as Franklin Webb: A former [IT technician](/wiki/Information_systems_technician \"Information systems technician\") for Jurassic World who is now the Dinosaur Protection Group's [systems analyst](/wiki/Systems_analyst \"Systems analyst\") and [hacker](/wiki/Hacking_\\(computer_security\\) \"Hacking \\(computer security\\)\").[14][12]\n  * [Daniella Pineda](/wiki/Daniella_Pineda \"Daniella Pineda\") as Zia Rodriguez: A former [Marine](/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps \"United States Marine Corps\") who is now the Dinosaur Protection Group's paleoveterinarian.[14][12][3]\n  * [James Cromwell](/wiki/James_Cromwell \"James Cromwell\") as Sir Benjamin Lockwood: [John Hammond](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#John_Hammond \"List of Jurassic Park characters\")'s former partner in developing the technology to clone dinosaurs.[15][16]\n  * [Toby Jones](/wiki/Toby_Jones \"Toby Jones\") as Gunnar Eversol:   \nAn auctioneer host at Lockwood Estate who sells the Isla Nublar dinosaurs for\nprofit.[17][3] In an interview, Jones likened his character to that of \"a\nrogue arms dealer; he sees profits in selling these creatures as weapons. He\nis totally morally neutral about whatever he is selling. He is only interested\nin whether or not it will make him a profit.\"[3]\n\n  * [Ted Levine](/wiki/Ted_Levine \"Ted Levine\") as Ken Wheatley: A seasoned mercenary who commands the rescue operation on Isla Nublar.[3]\n  * [B.

Speaking of his character’s actions,\nWong stated: \"I do think he’s motivated by his love for science and his own\nego, which is well supported by his massive achievements ... I think he turns\na blind eye to the human suffering that comes as a result because he thinks\nhe’s looking at some bigger picture.\"[18][19]\n\n  * Isabella Sermon as Maisie Lockwood: Lockwood's juvenile granddaughter and legal ward following her parents' deaths.[20][21][22][23]\n  * [Geraldine Chaplin](/wiki/Geraldine_Chaplin \"Geraldine Chaplin\") as Iris: The Lockwood Estate housekeeper, Maisie's nanny, and protector of the Lockwood family secrets.[24][3]\n  * [Jeff Goldblum](/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum \"Jeff Goldblum\") as [Ian Malcolm](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Ian_Malcolm \"List of Jurassic Park characters\"):   \nAn expert in [chaos theory](/wiki/Chaos_theory \"Chaos theory\") who once\nconsulted for [InGen](/wiki/InGen \"InGen\")'s Jurassic Park.[25] In a podcast\ninterview, Goldblum spoke of his role \"It's small… who knows, they may cut me\nout entirely! But if I stay in, I'll be a sprig of parsley or a little\ngarnish, hopefully with some impact!\"[26][27] Director Bayona confirmed that\nGoldblum's role is simply a [cameo](/wiki/Cameo_appearance \"Cameo\nappearance\"), stating, \"He doesn't have a major role in the action but it's\ndefinitely a very meaningful one in terms of the story.\"[28]\n\n  * [Peter Jason](/wiki/Peter_Jason \"Peter Jason\") as Senator Sherwood: A Senator who is among those who debate about saving the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDuring early conversations about the 2015 film _[Jurassic\nWorld](/wiki/Jurassic_World \"Jurassic World\")_ , executive producer [Steven\nSpielberg](/wiki/Steven_Spielberg \"Steven Spielberg\") told director [Colin\nTrevorrow](/wiki/Colin_Trevorrow \"Colin Trevorrow\") that he was interested in\nhaving several more films made.[29] In April 2014, Trevorrow announced that\nsequels had been discussed: \"We wanted to create something that would be a\nlittle bit less arbitrary and episodic, and something that could potentially\narc into a series that would feel like a complete story.\"[30] Trevorrow said\n[Chris Pratt](/wiki/Chris_Pratt \"Chris Pratt\") and [Omar Sy](/wiki/Omar_Sy\n\"Omar Sy\") might reprise their roles for the next few films and that he would\ndirect the film if asked.[30] He later told Spielberg he would only focus on\ndirecting one film in the series,[29] but in May 2015, Trevorrow announced\nthat he would not direct another film: \"I would be involved in some way, but\nnot as director.\" He felt different directors could bring different qualities\nto future films.[31] Pratt had been signed for future films in the series,[32]\nas was [Ty Simpkins](/wiki/Ty_Simpkins \"Ty Simpkins\"), who portrayed Gray in\n_Jurassic World_.[33]\n\nOn June 3, 2015, Trevorrow said that _Jurassic World_ left many story\npossibilities open: \"I really like the idea that this group of geneticists\naren't the only people who can make a dinosaur […] when you think of the\ndifferences between [Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\") and\n[PC](/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal computer\")—the minute something goes\n[open-source](/wiki/Open_source \"Open source\"), there are all kinds of\nentities and interests that may be able to utilize that technology.\"[34] On\nJune 8, 2015, _Jurassic World_ producer [Frank\nMarshall](/wiki/Frank_Marshall_\\(producer\\) \"Frank Marshall \\(producer\\)\") met\nwith Trevorrow and [Universal Pictures](/wiki/Universal_Pictures \"Universal\nPictures\") to discuss a sequel.[35] Later that month, he did not deny the film\ncould involve \"dinosaur soldiers\"[36] and said the series is \"not always gonna\nbe about a Jurassic Park\". He felt future films could explore the idea of\ndinosaurs and humans co-existing.[29] Trevorrow also hinted the next film\nmight not involve the Jurassic World theme park,[37] and said he would be\ninterested in seeing a _Jurassic Park_ film made by one of several unnamed\nSpanish horror film directors.[38]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nOn July 23, 2015, Universal announced a fifth film had been scheduled for a\nJune 22, 2018, release date in the U.S. It was also announced that Trevorrow\nwould write the script with his writing partner [Derek\nConnolly](/wiki/Derek_Connolly \"Derek Connolly\"), as they had for _Jurassic\nWorld_ ; that the film would be produced by Frank Marshall; and that Spielberg\nand Trevorrow would act as executive producers. Universal also said that Chris\nPratt and [Bryce Dallas Howard](/wiki/Bryce_Dallas_Howard \"Bryce Dallas\nHoward\") would reprise their roles from the previous film.[11] At the time of\nthe film's announcement, Trevorrow said the series \"isn't always going to be\nlimited to theme parks\". He confirmed the film would not involve \"a bunch of\ndinosaurs chasing people on an island\" stating, \"That'll get old real\nfast.\"[39] Trevorrow also spoke of the film's possible open-source storyline:\n\"It's almost like [InGen](/wiki/InGen \"InGen\") is [Mac](/wiki/Mac_OS \"Mac\nOS\"), but what if PC gets their hands on it? What if there are 15 different\nentities around the world who can make a dinosaur?\"[39]\n\nIn August 2015, Howard said the script was being written,[40] and it was\nannounced the film would be released in the UK two weeks early, on June 7,\n2018.[41] Later that year, [B. D. Wong](/wiki/B._D._Wong \"B. D. Wong\") said he\n\"would be happy to return\" as [Dr. Henry\nWu](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Henry_Wu \"List of Jurassic Park\ncharacters\"),[42] while Howard announced that filming would begin in 2017.[43]\nHoward also said she would be interested in seeing characters from earlier\n_Jurassic Park_ films return for the fifth film, saying, \"I could see versions\nof the film where a lot of the characters come back.\"[44] By October 2015,\ndirector [J. A. Bayona](/wiki/J._A._Bayona \"J. A. Bayona\") was being\nconsidered to direct the film. He chose instead to direct the [_World War Z_\nsequel](/wiki/World_War_Z_\\(film\\)#Sequel \"World War Z \\(film\\)\"), a project\nfor which he had already signed on.[45] In January 2016, it was reported that\nBayona could still be a candidate to direct the film after he dropped out of\nthe _World War Z_ sequel due to other commitments.[46]\n\nIn March 2016, [London](/wiki/London \"London\") was being\n[scouted](/wiki/Location_scouting \"Location scouting\") as a possible filming\nlocation and setting for the film;[47] it was subsequently announced that\nfilming would take place at a UK studio.[48] On April 14, 2016, actor [Jeff\nGoldblum](/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum \"Jeff Goldblum\") said he had no plans to appear\nin the film as his character [Ian\nMalcolm](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Ian_Malcolm \"List of\nJurassic Park characters\"), although he said he was open to the\npossibility.[49] On April 18, 2016, Bayona was announced as the film's\ndirector, with Belén Atienza and Patrick Crowley joining Marshall as\nproducers.[50] Spielberg, Marshall, and [Kathleen\nKennedy](/wiki/Kathleen_Kennedy_\\(producer\\) \"Kathleen Kennedy \\(producer\\)\")\nhad been impressed by his 2012 film, _[The\nImpossible](/wiki/The_Impossible_\\(2012_film\\) \"The Impossible \\(2012\nfilm\\)\")_ , and initially considered having him direct _Jurassic World_. He\ndeclined as he felt there was not enough time for production.[51][52]\nTrevorrow wanted Bayona to direct the film after seeing his 2007 horror film,\n_[The Orphanage](/wiki/The_Orphanage_\\(film\\) \"The Orphanage\n\\(film\\)\")_.[53][54] Before he was hired, Bayona had met with Trevorrow and\nbecame enthused with the project after being shown the script's second half,\nwhich would play out like a haunted house film.[55] After Bayona was hired,\nTrevorrow said of the film, \"We're moving it into new territory. J. A. Bayona\nis an incredible director and I know he'll push the boundaries of what a\n'Jurassic' movie is. I think it's important that we take risks. A franchise\nmust evolve or perish.\"[56] Trevorrow and Bayona worked closely throughout the\nfilm's production.[3] In June 2016, actor [Sam Neill](/wiki/Sam_Neill \"Sam\nNeill\") was asked if he would return to the series as Dr. Alan Grant and\nresponded, \"You never say never, but I think it's moved on. It's different\ntimes.\"[57]\n\nThe film, under the [working title](/wiki/Working_title \"Working title\") of\n_Ancient Futures_ ,[58] was in full pre-production as of July 2016, with\n[storyboards](/wiki/Storyboard \"Storyboard\") being designed.[59] [Andy\nNicholson](/wiki/Andy_Nicholson_\\(production_designer\\) \"Andy Nicholson\n\\(production designer\\)\") was hired as the film's [production\ndesigner](/wiki/Production_designer \"Production designer\"). He spent four\nweeks with Bayona in [Barcelona](/wiki/Barcelona \"Barcelona\"), discussing\nreference pictures and background details, as well as Bayona's ideas for the\nLockwood mansion.[3] Production was scheduled to begin in Hawaii in February\n2017.[60][61] [Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\") was also confirmed as a filming\nlocation,[62] including [Brecon Beacons](/wiki/Brecon_Beacons \"Brecon\nBeacons\") and [Penbryn](/wiki/Penbryn \"Penbryn\").[63] Trevorrow said that\nHawaii would be used as a primary filming location, while U.K. shooting would\nbe limited to studios, without the story taking place there. Trevorrow also\nsaid the film would feature many dinosaurs that were not seen in previous\nfilms and denied that the film's story would involve militarized dinosaurs,\nwhich would only be mentioned in the film.[64]\n\nFor the film's second half where dinosaurs are transported by boat to the\nmainland, [Ecuador](/wiki/Ecuador \"Ecuador\") and [Peru](/wiki/Peru \"Peru\") had\nboth been scouted as possible filming locations and settings. Marshall thought\nthat [Cabo San Lucas](/wiki/Cabo_San_Lucas \"Cabo San Lucas\") would be ideal,\nbut these locations ultimately did not work for the film's story. Although the\nfilm was shot partly in England, Spielberg felt the country was too far from\nthe fictional Isla Nublar to be used as the in-film setting for the second\nhalf. He and the producers did not want the film to spend too much time on a\nboat. Crowley stated, \"Rather than making it a movie about traveling on a\nboat, which is not very exciting, you needed to get to the place.\"[65]\n\nIn September 2016, Bayona confirmed the film would be the second chapter in a\nplanned _Jurassic World_ trilogy.[66] Later that year, Marshall said that Wong\nwas \"probably going to come back\".[67] _Jurassic World_ composer [Michael\nGiacchino](/wiki/Michael_Giacchino \"Michael Giacchino\") confirmed that he\nwould return as composer for the fifth film.[68] [Óscar\nFaura](/wiki/%C3%93scar_Faura \"Óscar Faura\") was announced as the film's\ncinematographer at the end of the year.[69]\n\n### Writing\n\nAlthough Spielberg was heavily involved in the development of ideas for\n_Jurassic World_ , he had Trevorrow and Connolly devise their own ideas for\nthe sequel. He retained final approval on the project.[70] In June 2015, about\ntwo weeks after the theatrical release of _Jurassic World_ , Trevorrow\nembarked on a road trip from Los Angeles to his home state of Vermont.\nConnolly agreed to accompany Trevorrow so they could discuss a basic set of\nideas Trevorrow had for the film.[3] During their eight-day trip,[71] they\nbegan work on the script and devised the basic story.[72][73] Trevorrow said\nthe film's story was inspired by a quote from [Dr. Alan\nGrant](/wiki/Dr._Alan_Grant \"Dr. Alan Grant\") in [the first\nfilm](/wiki/Jurassic_Park_\\(film\\) \"Jurassic Park \\(film\\)\"): \"Dinosaurs and\nman, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution, have suddenly\nbeen thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest\nidea of what to expect?\"[74] Trevorrow said that the story was heavily\ninfluenced by the idea that, \"A mistake made a long time ago just can't be\nundone.\"[64]\n\nThe film is also based on concepts from [Michael\nCrichton](/wiki/Michael_Crichton \"Michael Crichton\")'s novel _[Jurassic\nPark](/wiki/Jurassic_Park_\\(novel\\) \"Jurassic Park \\(novel\\)\")_ (1990) and its\nsequel _[The Lost World](/wiki/The_Lost_World_\\(Crichton_novel\\) \"The Lost\nWorld \\(Crichton novel\\)\")_ (1995), and includes dialogue from the first\nnovel.[64] Isla Nublar's volcano was in the first novel, and the writers chose\nto incorporate it into the film's plot.[75] Trevorrow compared the destruction\nof Isla Nublar to \"the burning down of a church or a temple,\" saying, \"I\nhonestly think it's like killing off a character in a way, and if you're going\nto do that, as long as you approach it with the proper respect and\nacknowledgement that you understand how indelible and permanent what you're\ndoing is, then hopefully people will have an emotional response but they won't\nhate you for it.\"[76] The idea to include a \"silent partner\" for John Hammond\nwas also inspired by the _Jurassic Park_ novel. Although the character of\nBenjamin Lockwood was not featured in the novel, the book depicts the early\nyears leading up to the cloning of dinosaurs. This made Trevorrow realize\nthere would have been many people involved in such a project, convincing him\nthat someone like Lockwood would be among those people.[77]\n\nIn his initial [film treatment](/wiki/Film_treatment \"Film treatment\"),\nTrevorrow had included story elements that Marshall and Crowley considered\nexcessive for a single film. The producers felt it was important to include\ndetails about Owen and Claire's lives after the events of _Jurassic\nWorld_.[65] Although the original ending was the same as the final film,\nTrevorrow had wanted to include more details about the integration of\ndinosaurs into the world. He chose to remove them to keep the story\nfocused.[78] The script's structure, Trevorrow said, was inspired by\nSpielberg's 2015 film _[Bridge of Spies](/wiki/Bridge_of_Spies_\\(film\\)\n\"Bridge of Spies \\(film\\)\")_ , in which two seemingly unrelated stories\n\"collide in the middle, and move on together.\"[70] Trevorrow was also inspired\nby the 1975 film _[Three Days of the Condor](/wiki/Three_Days_of_the_Condor\n\"Three Days of the Condor\")_ , saying, \"It's one of those places where you\nthink you know what the score is, and then everything changes, and then\nsuddenly you don't know who to trust.\"[70] Having directed _Jurassic World_ ,\nTrevorrow was familiar with how [animatronics](/wiki/Animatronics\n\"Animatronics\") worked and wrote scenes for the sequel that would allow for\ntheir use. For example, animatronics are incapable of certain actions such as\nrunning.[79]\n\nRegarding the idea of [human cloning](/wiki/Human_cloning \"Human cloning\"),\nTrevorrow said that \"we're so much closer to cloning humans than we are to\ncloning dinosaurs. It felt like far less of a leap to me than dinosaurs do.\n[...] To have a character who has such deep love and has felt such loss and\nthe inability to go on, I think is something we all feel. So the idea that you\nmight be able to bring someone back in that way is emotionally grounded in a\nvery universal idea.\"[80] Trevorrow also said he was interested in \"the larger\nimpact\" of genetic power, including its emotional impact and its potential\nhuman impact. He added, \"we knew that we didn't want to continue to make\nmovies about the dangers of messing with science. We want to tell a story\nabout where we are now, which is that we _have_ messed with science, we _have_\nfundamentally altered our world and now we're dealing with the\nconsequences.\"[77] Trevorrow was nervous about how audiences would react to\nthe story's human cloning aspect, an idea supported by Spielberg, who was\nexcited about the questions that such an idea could raise in the film's\nsequel.[76] Because of criticism of the death of\n[Zara](/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Zara_Young \"List of Jurassic\nPark characters\") in the previous film, Trevorrow said for _Jurassic World:\nFallen Kingdom_ , \"We made sure that every death was earned. Everybody\ndeserves their death in this movie, a lesson learned. In 2018 everyone earns\nit. Horrible people.\"[76]\n\nAfter Bayona was hired, he began reading Crichton's novels—including _Jurassic\nPark_ and _The Lost World_ —for inspiration and \"to try to immerse myself in\nCrichton's mind.\"[81][82] Trevorrow and Connolly began working with Bayona in\nJuly 2016, to perfect the script to the director's liking.[64] Trevorrow said\nthe film would be more \"suspenseful and scary\" than its predecessor: \"It's\njust the way it's designed; it's the way the story plays out. I knew I wanted\nBayona to direct it long before anyone ever heard that it was a possibility,\nso the whole thing was just built around his skillset.\"[64] Trevorrow later\ndescribed the film as \"_The Impossible_ meets _The Orphanage_ with\ndinosaurs.\"[54] Bayona said that with the first half of the film set on an\nisland, \"you have what you expect from a _Jurassic_ movie,\" while the second\nhalf \"moves to a totally different environment that feels more suspenseful,\ndarker, claustrophobic, and even has this kind of gothic element, which I\nlove.\"[83] The \"gothic element\" of suspense was influenced by [Alfred\nHitchcock](/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock \"Alfred Hitchcock\") films.[84] He compared\nit to _[The Empire Strikes Back](/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back \"The Empire\nStrikes Back\")_ and _[Star Trek II: The Wrath of\nKhan](/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of\nKhan\")_ , which were both considered darker than their predecessors.[85]\n\nTrevorrow said the film's dinosaurs would be \"a parable of the treatment\nanimals receive today: the abuse, medical experimentation, pets, having wild\nanimals in zoos like prisons, the use the military has made of them, animals\nas weapons.\"[86] The idea of weaponized dinosaurs came from Spielberg.[71][87]\nTrevorrow said that with the film's dinosaur auction, \"The worst instincts of\nmankind are revealed. The first film was very clearly about corporate greed.\nThis is just about human greed.\"[88] The film includes ideas previously\nfeatured in a rejected 2004 draft for _Jurassic Park IV_ (later _Jurassic\nWorld_), presented in the same structure: a return to Isla Nublar followed by\na second half set in a large [Gothic](/wiki/Gothic_architecture \"Gothic\narchitecture\") building on the mainland. The idea of a dinosaur auction was\nalso in the rejected draft, which Trevorrow had read while writing the first\n_Jurassic World_ film.[89][90]\n\nBayona had his own ideas incorporated into the script while essentially\nretaining the original story devised by Trevorrow and Connolly.[59] The film's\nunderwater opening sequence was already in their script. Bayona asked\nTrevorrow to push for it to become a bigger scene with a larger set.[55] One\nof Trevorrow's ideas was to include [Jeff Goldblum](/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum \"Jeff\nGoldblum\")'s character of Ian Malcolm, who appeared in the franchise's earlier\nfilms.[91] Trevorrow and Goldblum discussed dialogue ideas for Malcolm, and\nTrevorrow said he used a lot of dialogue from Crichton's _Jurassic Park_ novel\nfor the character.[3][92] Marshall said that Trevorrow wrote Malcolm as \"the\n'Uh oh, danger, I told you so' kind of character\".[52] Trevorrow said of\nMalcolm, \"I saw him as kind of [Al Gore](/wiki/Al_Gore \"Al Gore\"). He's got a\nbeard now, and he's like, 'I told all of you this was going to be a disaster,\nand sure enough it is.'\"[93] Bayona and Trevorrow ultimately removed certain\nmoments from the script they felt would be better for the sequel, which was\nexpected to depict dinosaurs having spread around the world.[76]\n\n### Casting\n\nIn October 2016, casting was underway for the role of a nine-year-old\ngirl.[94] Approximately 2,500 girls were interviewed for the part, which\nultimately went to Isabella Sermon, marking her film debut.[3] By November\n2016, [Tom Holland](/wiki/Tom_Holland_\\(actor\\) \"Tom Holland \\(actor\\)\")—who\npreviously starred in _The Impossible_ —had discussed a role in the film with\nBayona, but did not believe he would be available because of scheduling\nconflicts.[95] [Toby Jones](/wiki/Toby_Jones \"Toby Jones\"), [Rafe\nSpall](/wiki/Rafe_Spall \"Rafe Spall\"), and [Justice Smith](/wiki/Justice_Smith\n\"Justice Smith\") were cast at the end of the year.[96][97][98]\n\n[Daniella Pineda](/wiki/Daniella_Pineda \"Daniella Pineda\"), [Ted\nLevine](/wiki/Ted_Levine \"Ted Levine\") and [James\nCromwell](/wiki/James_Cromwell \"James Cromwell\") were cast in early\n2017,[99][100][16] while Wong confirmed his return as Dr. Henry Wu.[18] To\nmaintain secrecy, the _Ancient Futures_ title was used in the casting phase.\nDuring auditions, references to dinosaurs were replaced with animals such as\nlions and grizzly bears.[101][102] To convince the studio that Pineda was\nright for the role of Zia, Bayona had her demonstrate she could perform comedy\nand drama scenes, as well as [improvise](/wiki/Improvisation \"Improvisation\").\nPineda auditioned seven times before being given the role. She auditioned for\nBayona, Atienza, and Crowley but did not meet the cast until she arrived in\nEngland for filming.[103]\n\nIn March 2017, Bayona announced that [Geraldine\nChaplin](/wiki/Geraldine_Chaplin \"Geraldine Chaplin\"), who had appeared in\neach of his previous films, had joined the cast.[24] The next month, it was\nannounced that [Jeff Goldblum](/wiki/Jeff_Goldblum \"Jeff Goldblum\") would be\nreprising his role from the first two films as Dr. Ian Malcolm.[25] Bayona\nconsidered Malcolm a \"great character!\"[82] Marshall said, \"The world has\nchanged a lot since Ian Malcolm went to Jurassic Park and we need his point of\nview now more than ever. He told us about chaos theory, he was right.\"[104]\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming began at Langley Business Centre in [Slough](/wiki/Slough \"Slough\"),\nEngland, on February 23, 2017.[105][106] Scenes shot at the business center\nincluded Claire's Dinosaur Protection Group office, Owen training his baby\nraptors, and Owen and Claire attempting to retrieve blood from the sedated _T.\nrex_.[3] Most of the filming in England took place at [Pinewood\nStudios](/wiki/Pinewood_Studios \"Pinewood Studios\").[107] Because of its large\n[sound stages](/wiki/Sound_stage \"Sound stage\"), it was considered perfect for\nthe film's many interior scenes.[65] After filming concluded in England,\nproduction moved to [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii \"Hawaii\"),[108] which was used as a\nprimary filming location.[64] Scenes shot in Hawaii were set on [Isla\nNublar](/wiki/Isla_Nublar \"Isla Nublar\"), the fictional island featured in the\nfirst and fourth films.[109] Scenes were also expected to be shot at [Brecon\nBeacons National Park](/wiki/Brecon_Beacons_National_Park \"Brecon Beacons\nNational Park\") in Wales.[110] The film was shot in\n[CinemaScope](/wiki/CinemaScope \"CinemaScope\"), and is the first entry in the\n_Jurassic Park_ series presented in a 2.40:1 [aspect\nratio](/wiki/Aspect_ratio_\\(image\\) \"Aspect ratio \\(image\\)\"). The film crew\nused [Arri Alexa 65](/wiki/Arri_Alexa#Alexa_65 \"Arri Alexa\") exclusively.[91]\nSeveral scenes were shot to reference various films including _[From Here to\nEternity](/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity \"From Here to Eternity\")_ (1953) and\n_[Dracula](/wiki/Dracula_\\(1979_film\\) \"Dracula \\(1979 film\\)\")_ (1979), as\nwell as Spielberg's films _[Raiders of the Lost\nArk](/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\")_ (1981) and\n_[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial](/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial \"E.T. the\nExtra-Terrestrial\")_ (1982).[76][111] Spielberg was shown scenes from the film\nduring production and offered Bayona his opinions.[53]\n\nDuring filming, and in between [takes](/wiki/Take \"Take\"), Bayona used an\n[iPod](/wiki/IPod \"IPod\") to play different types of music on set to inspire\nthe actors, as he had done with his previous films.[112][113] He also played\nsound effects from other films in the series,[114] including a _T. rex_ roar\nthat he sometimes used to get a natural reaction from the actors.[115] In\nparticular, Bayona played unexpected sounds and loud music to scare Smith for\ncertain scenes, as his character is portrayed as easily frightened.[101][112]\nBayona and Pratt discussed each scene involving Owen's character before it was\nshot. Many of Pratt's ideas were used in the film. Discussing Levine's\ncharacter, Bayona said, \"He came with this idea of creating this kind of\nmilitary man. He just wanted to portray the most hateable character possible.\n[…] And he was so creative on set, trying to give ideas, bringing story notes\nto make this character more and more hateable.\"[55] The film includes several\nindirect references to U.S. President [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump\n\"Donald Trump\"), including an idea from Trevorrow where a [news\nticker](/wiki/News_ticker \"News ticker\") says the \"U.S. president\" has\nquestioned the \"existence of dinosaurs in the first place.\"[116][117][76][118]\nJones was allowed to decide his character's appearance, which included a wig\nsimilar to [Trump's hairstyle](/wiki/Donald_Trump%27s_hair \"Donald Trump's\nhair\").[76][117] An unscripted moment left in the film involves Levine's\ncharacter referring to Pineda's character Zia as a \"[nasty\nwoman](/wiki/Nasty_woman \"Nasty woman\")\", a comment that was previously made\nfamous by Trump.[117][119][118]\n\nIn April 2017, scenes were filmed at [East Berkshire\nCollege](/wiki/East_Berkshire_College \"East Berkshire College\") in\n[Berkshire](/wiki/Berkshire \"Berkshire\"), England,[120] and at [Loch\nLong](/wiki/Loch_Long \"Loch Long\") in [Argyll and Bute](/wiki/Argyll_and_Bute\n\"Argyll and Bute\"), Scotland.[121] Also that month, filming took place at\nHartland Park—formerly the [Pyestock jet engine test\nsite](/wiki/National_Gas_Turbine_Establishment \"National Gas Turbine\nEstablishment\")—in [Fleet, Hampshire](/wiki/Fleet,_Hampshire \"Fleet,\nHampshire\"), England,[122][123] where the film's opening sequence was shot. It\nwas filmed through the night and involved helicopters, rain machines, and\nlightning simulators to depict a thunderstorm.[3] Bayona described the opening\nscene as a \"massive action piece\" that resembled the\n[prologues](/wiki/Prologue \"Prologue\") used in [James Bond\nfilms](/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_films \"List of James Bond films\").[124] Scenes\nwere filmed on sets at [Hawley Common](/wiki/Hawley,_Hampshire \"Hawley,\nHampshire\"), also in Hampshire,[123] where the exterior of Lockwood's mansion\nwas built, as well as a mainland loading dock where the dinosaurs are\nbrought.[3] The exterior of the ship that transports Isla Nublar's dinosaurs\nto the mainland was created entirely through computer-generated effects by\n[Industrial Light & Magic](/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic \"Industrial Light\n& Magic\") (ILM), which worked on the previous films. The ship's interior was\nconstructed by Nicholson and his team as a large set at Pinewood Studios, and\nafter filming, it was rebuilt to depict the large rooftop of the Lockwood\nEstate.[3] The exterior of the [Cragside](/wiki/Cragside \"Cragside\") country\nhouse in [Northumberland](/wiki/Northumberland \"Northumberland\"), England,\nalong with its [coniferous](/wiki/Conifer \"Conifer\") surroundings, was used to\ndepict the Lockwood Estate exterior. The film crew took [plate\nshots](/wiki/Motion_control_photography \"Motion control photography\") of\nCragside and used a computer to combine the shots with footage filmed on set\nto create the exterior of the Lockwood Estate. No actors were involved in the\nCragside shoot.[125][126]\n\nNicholson [previsualized](/wiki/Previsualization \"Previsualization\") each of\nthe sets he and his team built to ensure they would be large enough for the\nintended scenes. He noted, \"Someone can tell you a Velociraptor is X-feet\nlong, but until you see it in the space, you can't appreciate what that means\nin terms of your set and the action that needs to take place within it.\"[3]\nThe interior of the multi-floor Lockwood Estate was built entirely on sound\nstages at Pinewood Studios. The estate set included Eli Mills' office, Dr.\nWu's large underground laboratory, an underground dinosaur containment\nfacility, separate bedrooms belonging to Benjamin and Maisie Lockwood, and a\nlarge library with dinosaur skeletons and artifacts. When filming was\ncompleted in the Lockwood library, the set was redecorated and converted into\nthe estate's underground garage, where the dinosaur auction takes place.[3]\nPratt said the film involved significantly more stunts than its\npredecessor.[3] An improvised fist fight scene, between Owen and several men\nduring the dinosaur auction, was added late in filming. It was the first such\nscene to be featured in the film series, and was filmed in a single continuous\nshot with the use of a [dolly track](/wiki/Tracking_shot \"Tracking shot\").[76]\n\nOn May 10, 2017, it was reported that scenes were being filmed at [Rock\nBarracks](/wiki/Rock_Barracks \"Rock Barracks\") military base, near\n[Woodbridge, Suffolk](/wiki/Woodbridge,_Suffolk \"Woodbridge, Suffolk\").[127]\nOn May 24, 2017, scenes were shot at Hampshire's [Blackbushe\nAirport](/wiki/Blackbushe_Airport \"Blackbushe Airport\"), which stood in as an\nAmerican airfield.[128] Filming in the United Kingdom concluded on June 10,\n2017.[108] Up to that point, Trevorrow was present as an on-set writer for\neach day of production so he could aid Bayona with any possible script\nchanges.[129][130] Goldblum shot his scenes in a single day at Pinewood\nStudios,[131] during the last day of filming in the United Kingdom.[132] Jones\nalso filmed his scenes on large sets at Pinewood Studios.[3]\n\nFilming in Hawaii was underway as of June 13, 2017,[133][134] and lasted more\nthan 25 days, with locations that included [Dillingham\nAirfield](/wiki/Dillingham_Airfield \"Dillingham Airfield\") and Pua'ena\nPoint.[135] On June 21, 2017, filming began at [Heʻeia Kea Small Boat\nHarbor](/wiki/He%CA%BBeia,_Hawaii \"Heʻeia, Hawaii\"),[136] which served as Isla\nNublar's shipping dock.[3] More than half the harbor was closed for filming,\nwhich required the use of [smoke machines](/wiki/Smoke_machine \"Smoke\nmachine\"). Scenes were scheduled to be shot there until the end of the\nmonth.[136][137] Filming also took place in a nearby Heʻeia jungle for scenes\nwhere Owen searches for and locates Blue.[3] As a reference to the first\n_Jurassic Park_ film, the scene between Owen and Blue includes an overturned\n[Ford Explorer](/wiki/Ford_Explorer \"Ford Explorer\"), previously featured in\nthe original film as a Jurassic Park tour vehicle. Trevorrow had initially\nconsidered including the vehicle in a scene in _Jurassic World_ , before\nsettling on the original Jurassic Park visitor center instead.[138] On June\n22, 2017, the film's official title was announced as _Jurassic World: Fallen\nKingdom_.[139] At the time, filming was underway at [Kualoa\nRanch](/wiki/Kualoa_Ranch \"Kualoa Ranch\") on the Hawaiian island of\n[Oahu](/wiki/Oahu \"Oahu\").[140] Filming at Kualoa Ranch included the exterior\nset for a radio tower bunker.[3]\n\nIn Hawaii, scenes where characters are running were filmed with the use of the\nEdge Arm, a [stabilized camera](/wiki/Camera_stabilizer \"Camera stabilizer\")\nthat was attached to a crane, which was mounted to a truck that drove\nalongside the actors. This specialized camera allowed for scenes to be shot\nsteadily despite the truck being driven over rough terrain.[141] The film\nincludes a scene on Isla Nublar where Claire and Franklin are riding in a\nball-shaped Jurassic World Gyrosphere ride to evade dinosaurs.[142] It was\nshot at Kualoa Ranch[3] and in England. Bayona described it as one of the\nfilm's biggest challenges.[142] In Hawaii, the Edge Arm was used to film the\nactors riding in the Gyrosphere as it was hauled on a trailer to simulate its\nmovement.[142][141] In England, an outdoor roller coaster track with a 40-foot\ndrop was constructed for the Gyrosphere, which Howard and Smith rode in to\nshoot a scene where the ride plummets off a cliff and into the water\nsurrounding Isla Nublar.[142][143] Although this portion of the scene could\nhave been shot with the use of a [green screen](/wiki/Chroma_key \"Chroma\nkey\"), Bayona wanted the actors to express genuine fear for the scene.[143]\nThe last part of the scene was shot at Pinewood Studios, where a large indoor\ntank was constructed and filled with water to depict the submerged ride as\nOwen tries to break it open and rescue Claire and Franklin.[142][144] This\nportion of the scene was filmed in five different takes that were merged to\nmake it seem like a single continuous shot.[145] Pratt was aided by a diving\ninstructor while he shot the scene, which also involved Howard and Smith being\nunderwater.[142][144] Filming in the tank lasted five days,[3] and required a\ncrew of 85.[146] It was shot primarily by a [second unit](/wiki/Second_unit\n\"Second unit\") crew, as Bayona was busy directing scenes on other\nsoundstages.[145]\n\n[David Vickery](/wiki/David_Vickery \"David Vickery\") and his team at ILM\ncreated the volcanic special effects and consulted\n[volcanologists](/wiki/Volcanologist \"Volcanologist\") for research. According\nto Vickery, the team asked \"how a volcano of this type might erupt\" and also\nrequested information about \"the various stages of lava and [pyroclastic\nflow](/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow \"Pyroclastic flow\"). We are speeding it up a bit\nfor the sake of our film, but it is definitely all based on real science.\"[3]\nThe lava was created through digital effects, although one scene used [cat\nlitter](/wiki/Cat_litter \"Cat litter\") set on fire as a stand-in on set, so\nthe actors would know where to react. The scene was set in an Isla Nublar\nbunker as lava begins dripping from the roof. The litter had been soaked in\nflammable liquid, and was dropped from 12 different nozzles above the\nset.[143][147]\n\nThe Main Street section of the Jurassic World theme park was rebuilt on\n[Police Beach](/wiki/Papailoa_Beach \"Papailoa Beach\") in Hawaii for a scene\nwhere Owen and Claire return to the island.[3] The set had been built\npreviously in Louisiana for filming of the previous _Jurassic World_ , but was\ndismantled after filming concluded.[138] For the sequel, Nicholson had part of\nthe Main Street practically built, although the park's visitor center could\nnot be constructed in its entirety because of its large size. Unbuilt portions\nof the park were created by ILM using digital set extensions. Main Street was\nthe largest set built in Hawaii, and required more than three months to\ncomplete.[3] Many of the same prop makers returned to recreate the Main Street\nset, which then had to be aged to give the appearance of abandonment.[138]\n\nOn July 7, 2017, filming took place at Oahu's [Hālona\nBlowhole](/wiki/H%C4%81lona_Blowhole \"Hālona Blowhole\"),[148][149] where\nPratt, Howard and Smith shot scenes on a beach.[3] Filming concluded on July\n8, 2017,[150] after shooting was completed at Hālona Blowhole.[151] Bayona\nsaid that making the film was the biggest challenge of his life.[54] The\n[original cut](/wiki/Rough_cut \"Rough cut\") of the film was approximately two\nhours and 45 minutes,[152] which the filmmakers considered too long.[153] It\nwas trimmed to two hours and eight minutes for the final cut.[152] One scene\nremoved from the film for runtime reasons revealed the character of Zia to be\na lesbian, an idea that came from Bayona and Trevorrow.[153]\n\n### Creatures on screen\n\nSee also: [List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park\nseries](/wiki/List_of_cloned_animals_in_the_Jurassic_Park_series \"List of\ncloned animals in the Jurassic Park series\")\n\nThe film's dinosaurs were created using a combination of animatronics and\n[computer-generated imagery](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-\ngenerated imagery\") (CGI).[3] Special effects artist [Neal\nScanlan](/wiki/Neal_Scanlan \"Neal Scanlan\") served as the film's creature\neffects supervisor,[154] while Vickery and Alex Wuttke were [visual effects\nsupervisors](/wiki/Visual_effects_supervisor \"Visual effects\nsupervisor\").[155] Scanlan worked on the animatronic dinosaurs, while Vickery\nand his ILM team created versions of the dinosaurs through CGI.[154] ILM\nanimators in Vancouver worked on dinosaur stampede scenes, while ILM's London\nstudio created the remaining creature scenes. Approximately 52 ILM animators\nworked on the film.[156] Scanlan worked closely with Bayona and Vickery to\ncreate the creatures.[154] Vickery and ILM did extensive research to\naccurately create and depict the dinosaurs, which included consulting with\n[paleontologists](/wiki/Paleontologist \"Paleontologist\"). The ILM team also\nreferred to elephants and rhinos to determine how the dinosaurs should move\nand behave.[3] Dinosaur expert John Hankla, of the [Denver Museum of Nature\nand Science](/wiki/Denver_Museum_of_Nature_and_Science \"Denver Museum of\nNature and Science\"), served as an advisor on the film.[157] After reading fan\nthoughts on dinosaurs and speaking with children, Bayona realized that\ndinosaur textures and colors were often brought up and said, \"I thought that\nwas the area where I could play with. They feel somehow a little bit more\nexotic and richer in this movie.\"[154] New research had also suggested that\nreal dinosaurs were more colorful and brighter than previously thought.[3]\n\nThe film features more dinosaurs than any previous film in the series.[54]\nBayona wanted to include several new dinosaurs not seen in earlier films,[154]\nincluding _[Allosaurus](/wiki/Allosaurus \"Allosaurus\")_ ,\n_[Baryonyx](/wiki/Baryonyx \"Baryonyx\")_ , _[Carnotaurus](/wiki/Carnotaurus\n\"Carnotaurus\")_ , _[Sinoceratops](/wiki/Sinoceratops \"Sinoceratops\")_ ,\n_[Stygimoloch](/wiki/Stygimoloch \"Stygimoloch\")_ , and the fictional\n_Indoraptor_.[158] _Baryonyx_ and _Carnotaurus_ were among the creatures\ncreated through CGI.[156] _[Dilophosaurus](/wiki/Dilophosaurus\n\"Dilophosaurus\")_ was in the film's original cut, but was removed.[152] The\nfilm features more animatronic dinosaurs than any previous sequel,[159][160]\nand the animatronics used were more technologically advanced than in the\nearlier films.[159] Five animatronic dinosaurs were created for the film,\nwhereas the previous film featured only one.[3] More animatronics were used\nbecause the film features closer interaction between humans and dinosaurs than\nits predecessor, including a scene where Howard rides atop the sedated _T.\nrex_.[3][161] Bayona said that animatronics \"are very helpful on set,\nespecially for the actors so they have something to perform against. There's\nan extra excitement if they can act in front of something real.\"[154] Scanlan\nfelt animatronics were not best for every scene: \"In some ways it will have an\nimpact on your shooting schedule; you have to take time to film with an\nanimatronic. In the balance, we ask ourselves if it is economically and\nartistically more valuable to do it that way, or as a post-production effect.\nOnce we have looked at each particular case, with the director and the VFX\nsupervisor we decide whether—because of the environment or the\ncircumstances—it is the right way to go practically.\"[3]\n\nScanlan spent more than eight months at Pinewood Studios working on the\ncreatures before and during filming, with a crew of approximately 35\npeople.[162] Scanlan's team created functional animatronic models of the _T.\nrex_ , the _Indoraptor_ and Blue, while ILM worked on CGI versions of the\ncreatures.[154][156]\n\n  * The _T. rex_ was one of the first animatronic creatures needed for filming, in the form of a full-scale head and shoulders. ILM sent Scanlan a model of the _T. rex_ from its appearance in _Jurassic World_. Scanlan used it to create a full-scale [3D print](/wiki/3D_printing \"3D printing\") of the _T. rex_ head and shoulders.[3] The life-sized _T. rex_ animatronic, which had the ability to breathe and move its head, was controlled with joysticks.[159] It was used for a scene where the sedated creature is inside a cage while Owen and Claire attempt to retrieve blood from it. The beginning shots of the scene were created using only the animatronic, while the ending shots solely used CGI. The middle portion of the scene used a combination of the two methods.[156] Within the film's story, the _T. rex_ is portrayed as the same individual featured in previous films.[163] Trevorrow said, \"We've been following this same character since the beginning; she's the same _T. rex_ that was in _Jurassic Park_ and in _Jurassic World_. She is iconic—not just because she's a _T. rex_ , but because she's _this T. rex_.\"[3]\n  * The Blue animatronic was created to lay down on an operating table, depicting the animal in an injured state while the character of Zia operates on the creature. Up to 12 [puppeteers](/wiki/Puppeteer \"Puppeteer\"), hidden under the operating table, were needed to control the animatronic during filming.[3] The scene was shot twice, with and without the Blue animatronic, and the two versions were later combined for a seamless effect.[76] In creating Blue through CGI, the animators referred to the animal's appearance in the previous film.[156] According to Vickery, Blue's movements were designed to resemble a dog: \"You look at the way Blue cocks her head and looks up at you. It's exactly like a dog. You're trying to sort of connect the dinosaur with things that you understand as a human.\"[155]\n  * The _Indoraptor_ was primarily created through CGI, while a practical head, neck, shoulders, foot and arm were created for close-up shots.[157] For some scenes, an inflatable _Indoraptor_ stand-in was operated by two puppeteers on set, to be later replaced by a CGI version of the creature.[143] The _Indoraptor_ was designed to have long human-like arms.[76] The creature is depicted as a [quadruped](/wiki/Quadruped \"Quadruped\") and [biped](/wiki/Biped \"Biped\"),[156] with a height of approximately 10 ft (3.0 m) tall while standing on two legs.[3] Bayona chose black for the _Indoraptor_ 's color because he wanted the creature to have the appearance of a black shadow, saying \"it's very terrifying when you see the Indoraptor in the dark because you can only see the eyes and the teeth.\"[76]\n\nScanlan's team also made puppeteering aids, [rod puppets](/wiki/Rod_puppet\n\"Rod puppet\"), and several prop dinosaurs, all created by coordinating with\nVickery to ensure a consistent result between the practical effects and\nCGI.[154] Animal motions that could not be perfected with puppetry, such as\nblinking, were created with computer technology.[3] Among the puppeteer\ndinosaurs were baby velociraptors used for a scene with Pratt.[162] The\nscene's final, wider shots used two-wheeled, remote-controlled toys to stand-\nin for the baby raptors on set. The toys included a spring which gave them the\nability to jump. The feature was used to get a genuinely startled reaction\nfrom Pratt.[143] Although [motion capture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion\ncapture\") was used in the previous film to depict velociraptors, ILM\ndetermined after several tests the technology would not be adequate for\ndepicting dinosaurs in _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_. They chose instead to\nuse [key frame](/wiki/Key_frame \"Key frame\") animation done for the previous\nfilms. However, some motion capture was done as a form of\n[previsualization](/wiki/Previsualization \"Previsualization\") to aid\nBayona.[156] ILM used key framing to create scenes involving a large number of\ndinosaurs and referred to [high-speed photography](/wiki/High-\nspeed_photography \"High-speed photography\") of horses racing for aid in\ncreating such scenes.[156] The fight scene between Blue and the _Indoraptor_ ,\nset in Maisie's bedroom, was designed in London and key framed by ILM. Jance\nRubinchik, animation supervisor for ILM, said the fight was the \"trickiest\nsequence\" because of the lack of previsualization.[156] According to Bayona, a\n_[Brachiosaurus](/wiki/Brachiosaurus \"Brachiosaurus\")_ shown dying in the\nvolcanic eruption is meant to be the same individual that is first seen in the\noriginal _Jurassic Park_. The _Brachiosaurus_ in the new film was created\nusing the same animations from the 1993 film. The dinosaur's death was the\nlast shot on the entire film to be finished; Bayona and the post-production\nteam worked through the night to perfect the scene's colors and composition,\nshortly before the film's release.[76]\n\nFor advice on veterinary procedures and animatronic movements, the filmmakers\nsought a veterinary surgeon who had experience with [African\nwildlife](/wiki/Fauna_of_Africa \"Fauna of Africa\"). Jonathan Cranston, a\n[Gloucestershire](/wiki/Gloucestershire \"Gloucestershire\") veterinary surgeon,\nwas recommended for the position because of his experience with wildlife in\n[South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\"). He advised Bayona and the\nproducers on how to choreograph several scenes to accurately depict complex\nveterinarian procedures that involved the dinosaurs. Cranston also worked\nclosely with Pratt, Howard, Pineda and Smith to teach them how to perform such\nprocedures. He also advised the puppeteers on creating subtle and authentic\nanimal movements and worked with Bayona on two scenes. Cranston was on set for\n12 days, primarily at Pinewood Studios.[164]\n\n## Marketing\n\nA six-second clip from the film was released on November 22, 2017.[165][166]\nThe first trailer was teased for release on November 30, 2017. This was later\nconfirmed to be incorrect.[167] Several [teaser trailers](/wiki/Teaser_trailer\n\"Teaser trailer\") and a behind-the-scenes [featurette](/wiki/Featurette\n\"Featurette\") of the film were released in early December\n2017,[168][169][170][171] before the release of a full-length trailer on\nDecember 7.[23][168] That month,[172] Universal launched a website for the\nDinosaur Protection Group. It included miscellaneous information about the\ngroup and its effort to save the island's dinosaurs,[14] as well as a video\nfeaturing Howard, Pineda and Smith as their characters.[173] The website was\ncreated by Timothy Glover and Jack Anthony Ewins, who created the [Masrani\nGlobal website](/wiki/Jurassic_World#Marketing_and_promotion \"Jurassic World\")\nfor _Jurassic World_.[174] A second trailer aired during [Super Bowl\nLII](/wiki/Super_Bowl_LII \"Super Bowl LII\") on February 4, 2018.[175][176] A\n30-second teaser trailer was released on April 13, 2018, announcing the\nrelease of a third full trailer on April 18.[177][178] Several of the trailers\nand commercials for the film included scenes from the ending that depict the\n_Tyrannosaurus rex_ and the _Mosasaurus_ now loose in the world. This\nfrustrated Trevorrow, who preferred not to show such scenes before the film's\nrelease.[77][179]\n\nUniversal had the benefit of a global marketing campaign by its partners\nvalued at $185 million, more than double the value of the previous film's\npartner program.[180] The campaign included nine partners—[Dairy\nQueen](/wiki/Dairy_Queen \"Dairy Queen\"), [Doritos](/wiki/Doritos \"Doritos\"),\n[Dr Pepper](/wiki/Dr_Pepper \"Dr Pepper\"), [Ferrero SpA](/wiki/Ferrero_SpA\n\"Ferrero SpA\"), [Jeep](/wiki/Jeep \"Jeep\"), [Juicy Fruit](/wiki/Juicy_Fruit\n\"Juicy Fruit\"), [Kellogg's](/wiki/Kellogg%27s \"Kellogg's\"),\n[M&M's](/wiki/M%26M%27s \"M&M's\"), and\n[Skittles](/wiki/Skittles_\\(confectionery\\) \"Skittles \\(confectionery\\)\")—who\naired television commercials and sold products to promote the film.[180] The\nglobal marketing campaign consisted of 1.3 billion promotional items including\n100 million boxes of Kellogg's products and 15 million packages of [Kinder\nJoy](/wiki/Kinder_Joy \"Kinder Joy\") candy by Ferrero.[180] Dairy Queen, a\nreturning partner from the previous film, sold \"Jurassic Chomp\" ice cream\ndesserts in collectable cups, while Doritos and Dr Pepper marketed versions of\ntheir products that featured images of the film's dinosaurs.[180][181] For\nSuper Bowl LII, Trevorrow directed a Jeep commercial starring Goldblum\nfeaturing a _T. rex_. Within 24 hours of its release, the commercial received\n39.7 million online views, more than any film trailer watched online following\nits Super Bowl television debut.[180] Universal also teamed up with\n[Amazon](/wiki/Amazon_\\(company\\) \"Amazon \\(company\\)\") for a marketing stunt\nwhere a dinosaur-sized box was driven around Los Angeles on a truck to promote\nthe film.[182][183]\n\nLicensing partners [Mattel](/wiki/Mattel \"Mattel\"), [Lego](/wiki/Lego \"Lego\"),\nand [Funko](/wiki/Funko \"Funko\") created toys based on the\nfilm.[184][185][186][187] Mattel produced a variety of toys,[188] including\ndinosaurs and action figures,[189][190] as well as [Barbie](/wiki/Barbie\n\"Barbie\") dolls featuring the likeness of Pratt and Howard as their\ncharacters.[185] Mattel released a [mobile app](/wiki/Mobile_app \"Mobile app\")\ntitled _Jurassic World Facts_ as a [tie-in](/wiki/Tie-in \"Tie-in\") to its\ndinosaur toys, which included symbols that could be scanned to collect facts\nabout each creature.[191] Lego released a number of Lego sets and characters\nbased on the film.[192] A video game, _[Jurassic World\nEvolution](/wiki/Jurassic_World_Evolution \"Jurassic World Evolution\")_ , was\nreleased simultaneously with the film.[193] A two-part [virtual\nreality](/wiki/Virtual_reality \"Virtual reality\") miniseries titled _Jurassic\nWorld: Blue_ , created by Felix & Paul Studios and Industrial Light and Magic,\nwas released for [Oculus VR headsets](/wiki/Oculus_VR#Products \"Oculus VR\") as\na film tie-in, featuring Blue on Isla Nublar at the time of the volcanic\neruption.[194][195][196][197] Trevorrow, Glover and Ewins created a website\nand campaign for \"Extinction Now!\" (the antithesis to the Dinosaur Protection\nGroup), which was launched shortly before the film's release.[174] The\ncampaign included a [found-footage](/wiki/Found_footage_\\(film_technique\\)\n\"Found footage \\(film technique\\)\") clip of a _Tyrannosaurus_ loose in San\nDiego, a reference to _[The Lost World: Jurassic\nPark](/wiki/The_Lost_World:_Jurassic_Park \"The Lost World: Jurassic\nPark\")_.[174][198]\n\n## Release\n\n_Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ had its premiere at the [WiZink\nCenter](/wiki/WiZink_Center \"WiZink Center\") in [Madrid](/wiki/Madrid\n\"Madrid\"), Spain, on May 21, 2018.[199][200] The film's international\ntheatrical release began in Singapore and Malaysia on June 7,[201][202] the\nUnited Kingdom, India, Italy, South Korea and Angola on June 8,[203] and\nPakistan on June 16, 2018. The film was released in the United States on June\n22, 2018.[11][84]\n\n### Home media\n\n_Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ is scheduled for digital release on September\n4, 2018, and [Blu-ray](/wiki/Blu-ray \"Blu-ray\"), [DVD](/wiki/DVD \"DVD\"), [Blu-\nray 3D](/wiki/Blu-ray_3D \"Blu-ray 3D\") and [4K Blu-ray](/wiki/4K_Blu-ray \"4K\nBlu-ray\") on September 18, 2018.[204]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nAs of August 28,\n2018[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jurassic_World:_Fallen_Kingdom&action=edit),\n_Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ has grossed $413.2 million in the United\nStates and Canada and $881.5 million in other territories for a total\nworldwide gross of $1.295 billion. The production budget was in the range of\n$170–187 million.[7]\n\nThe film crossed the $1 billion mark on July 5, 2018, becoming the 35th film\nof all-time to reach this milestone, and the seventh film for Universal. It\nalso made Universal the second studio (after Disney) to have at least two\nfilms in three different franchises make $1 billion worldwide, alongside _[The\nFast and the Furious](/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious \"The Fast and the\nFurious\")_ and _[Despicable Me](/wiki/Despicable_Me_\\(franchise\\) \"Despicable\nMe \\(franchise\\)\")_.[205]\n\n#### United States and Canada\n\nIn December 2017, a survey from [Fandango](/wiki/Fandango_\\(company\\)\n\"Fandango \\(company\\)\") indicated that _Fallen Kingdom_ was one of the most\nanticipated films of 2018.[206] Initial projections three weeks before its\nrelease had the film grossing between $130–150 million in its opening weekend\nin the United States and Canada, with [_BoxOffice_\nmagazine](/wiki/BoxOffice_\\(magazine\\) \"BoxOffice \\(magazine\\)\") estimating a\ntotal of $325–380 million for its final domestic gross.[207][208] By the week\nof its release, the low-end projections had reached $135 million.[6] It was\nreleased on June 22, 2018, in 4,475 theaters (the second-widest release ever\nbehind _[Despicable Me 3](/wiki/Despicable_Me_3 \"Despicable Me 3\")_) grossing\n$58.7 million on its opening day, the second-highest of the franchise and\n28th-best on record.[209] The film grossed $15.3 million from Thursday night\npreviews at 3,600 theaters, down from the $18.5 million grossed by _Jurassic\nWorld_. It ended up debuting at $148 million, the 20th-best opening weekend of\nall-time and second highest for Universal. It also marked the second time two\nfilms opened to over $100 million on back-to-back weekends, following\n_[Incredibles 2](/wiki/Incredibles_2 \"Incredibles 2\")_ 's $182.7 million debut\nthe week before, since May 2007 when _[Shrek the Third](/wiki/Shrek_the_Third\n\"Shrek the Third\")_ and _[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's\nEnd](/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_At_World%27s_End \"Pirates of the\nCaribbean: At World's End\")_ opened to $121.6 million and $114.7 million,\nrespectively.[209][210][211] In its second weekend the film made $60 million,\na drop of 59% and less than the $105.8 million made by _Jurassic World_ in its\nsophomore weekend. In its third weekend made $28.3 million.[212][213]\n\n#### Outside North America\n\nOverseas, the film was released in 48 countries between June 6 and June 8,\n2018, including France, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Italy,\nRussia, and Spain. It was projected to gross $130–145 million on its opening\nweekend.[214] It made $20.2 million on its first day, including $1.4 million\nin France and $1 million in Indonesia. In South Korea, it grossed $9.7 million\n([₩](/wiki/South_Korean_won \"South Korean won\")10.3 billion) and sold over 1\nmillion tickets, setting opening day records for both (beating _[The\nMummy](/wiki/The_Mummy_\\(2017_film\\) \"The Mummy \\(2017 film\\)\")_ 's ₩7.4\nbillion and _[Avengers: Infinity War](/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War \"Avengers:\nInfinity War\")_ 's 980,000).[215] It went on to have an international debut of\n$151.1 million, including $8 million from IMAX screenings. Its largest opening\nmarkets were South Korea ($27.2 million), the UK ($19.9 million), France ($10\nmillion), Spain ($9.5 million) and Germany ($9.1 million).[216] In China, the\nfilm was released on June 15 and made $34.4 million ([¥](/wiki/Renminbi\n\"Renminbi\")220 million) on its opening day, nearly double the first day total\nof its predecessor ($17.5 million).[217] The film went on to open to $111.9\nmillion (¥715 million), the fourth best-ever in the country for a Hollywood\nrelease (behind _[The Fate of the Furious](/wiki/The_Fate_of_the_Furious \"The\nFate of the Furious\")_ , _Avengers: Infinity War_ and _[Transformers: The Last\nKnight](/wiki/Transformers:_The_Last_Knight \"Transformers: The Last\nKnight\")_), and bringing its two week international total to $372.1 million,\nmore than the entire lifetime gross of _[Jurassic Park\nIII](/wiki/Jurassic_Park_III \"Jurassic Park III\")_ ($368 million).[218] In its\nthird week of international release the film made $106.7 million, bringing its\ntotal to $561.5 million. China remained one of the top markets with $32.4\nmillion (a standard 71% drop for Hollywood films in the country), while it was\nalso released in Mexico ($12.3 million), Brazil ($9.2 million) and Australia\n$7.9 million).[219] As of July 5, 2018, the film has grossed $245.5 million in\nChina, making it the 5th highest grossing Hollywood film of all-time in the\ncountry.[205]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregation website [Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten\nTomatoes\"), _Fallen Kingdom_ holds an approval rating of 50% based on 331\nreviews, and an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's critical consensus\nreads, \"_Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ adds another set piece-packed entry\nto the blockbuster franchise, although genuinely thrilling moments are in\nincreasingly short supply.\"[220] On [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic\n\"Metacritic\"), which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a\nweighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating\n\"mixed or average reviews\".[221] Audiences polled by\n[CinemaScore](/wiki/CinemaScore \"CinemaScore\") gave the film an average grade\nof \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while [PostTrak](/wiki/PostTrak \"PostTrak\")\nreported filmgoers gave it an 82% overall positive score.[209]\n\n_[Variety](/wiki/Variety_\\(magazine\\) \"Variety \\(magazine\\)\")_ 's [Owen\nGleiberman](/wiki/Owen_Gleiberman \"Owen Gleiberman\") called the film better\nthan the first _Jurassic World_ but wrote \"...

The film’s a rush for an audience that only wants the high.\"\n[224]\n\nIn a more critical assessment, [Peter Travers](/wiki/Peter_Travers \"Peter\nTravers\") of _[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone_\\(magazine\\) \"Rolling Stone\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ said \"...this sequel has the perfunctory vibe that comes from\nfilmmakers who cynically believe the public will buy anything _T. rex_\n-related, no matter how shoddy the goods or warmed-over the plot.\" [225]\nSenior Editor Matt Goldberg of [Collider](/wiki/Collider_\\(website\\) \"Collider\n\\(website\\)\") also criticized the screenplay stating, \"The film is too lazy to\neven bother with the modest housekeeping of explaining its characters’\nmotives.\"[226] _[The Verge](/wiki/The_Verge \"The Verge\")_ 's Bryan Bishop was\nequally critical, writing, \"Like its predecessor, _Fallen Kingdom_ is\noverstuffed with ethical conundrums, and not sophisticated enough to fully\nengage with them ... the movie's villains become such cartoony caricatures\nthat it's impossible to take _Fallen Kingdom_ 's attempted philosophical\nmusings seriously.\"[227] Sam Machkovech of _[Ars Technica](/wiki/Ars_Technica\n\"Ars Technica\")_ called the film a [B movie](/wiki/B_movie \"B movie\")\nconsisting of \"a sixth-grade sketchbook mash of dino-murder, cartoonish\nvillains, and plot holes\",[228] while Travis M. Andrews of _[The Washington\nPost](/wiki/The_Washington_Post \"The Washington Post\")_ said the film had\n\"achieved the impossible: it makes dinosaurs boring.\"[229]\n\nIn a positive review, Scott Mendelson of _[Forbes](/wiki/Forbes \"Forbes\")_\nwrote, \"_Fallen Kingdom_ is a gorgeous, mostly enjoyable blockbuster that\nlooked great in IMAX. That it doesn't cash all the checks it tries to write is\nwhy it's merely a good movie instead of a great one.\"[230] Writing for _[The\nHollywood Reporter](/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter \"The Hollywood Reporter\")_ ,\nJohn DeFore also praised the film saying, \"Finally making good on its name,\nJ.A. Bayona's _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ says goodbye to the park for\ngood, not just carrying the de-extincted dinos off the island but freeing\nitself from the genre trappings of the previous four films.\"[231]\n_[Exclaim!](/wiki/Exclaim! \"Exclaim!\")_ 's Alex Hudson said the film is \"a\nstraight-ahead monster movie: it's dumb, occasionally gory, and mostly plenty\nof fun ...
