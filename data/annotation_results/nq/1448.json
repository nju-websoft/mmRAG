United\nStates](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United\nStates\") other than the [Chief Justice of the United\nStates](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States \"Chief Justice of the United\nStates\"). The number of associate justices is determined by the [United States\nCongress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\") and is\ncurrently set at eight by the [Judiciary Act of\n1869](/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869 \"Judiciary Act of 1869\").\n\nLike the chief justice, associate justices are nominated by the [President of\nthe United States](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the\nUnited States\") and are confirmed by the [United States\nSenate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\") by majority vote.\nThis is provided for in [Article\nII](/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article Two of the\nUnited States Constitution\") of the\n[Constitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\"),\nwhich states that the president \"shall nominate, and by and with the [Advice\nand Consent](/wiki/Advice_and_consent \"Advice and consent\") of the Senate,\nshall appoint... Judges of the supreme Court.\" Although the Constitution\nrefers to them as \"Judges of the Supreme Court\", the title actually used is\n\"Associate Justice\", introduced in the [Judiciary Act of\n1789](/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789 \"Judiciary Act of 1789\").[1] Associate\njustices were traditionally styled \"Mr. Justice\" in court opinions, but the\ntitle was shortened to \"Justice\" in 1980, a year before [Sandra Day\nO'Connor](/wiki/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor \"Sandra Day O'Connor\") became the first\nfemale justice.[2]\n\n[Article III](/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article\nThree of the United States Constitution\") of the Constitution specifies that\nassociate justices, and all other [United States federal\njudges](/wiki/United_States_federal_judge \"United States federal judge\")\n\"shall hold their Offices during good Behavior\". This language means that the\nappointments are effectively [for life](/wiki/Life_tenure \"Life tenure\"), and\nthat, once\n[confirmed](/wiki/Appointment_and_confirmation_to_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#Confirmation\n\"Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States\"), a\njustice's tenure of office ends only when they [die](/wiki/Death \"Death\"),\n[retire](/wiki/Retirement \"Retirement\"), resign, or are removed from office\nthrough the [impeachment process](/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States\n\"Impeachment in the United States\").\n\nEach Supreme Court justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued\nbefore it; the chief justice's vote counts no more than that of any other\njustice. However, in drafting opinions, the chief justice enjoys additional\ninfluence in case disposition if in the majority through his power to assign\nwho writes the opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns\nthe writing of a decision. Furthermore, the chief justice leads the discussion\nof the case among the justices. The chief justice has certain administrative\nresponsibilities that the other justices do not and is paid slightly more\n($255,500 per year, as opposed to $244,400 per year for each associate\njustice[3]).\n\nAssociate justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the chief\njustice is always considered to be the most senior. If two justices are\nappointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior justice of the\ntwo. Currently, the senior associate justice is [Anthony\nKennedy](/wiki/Anthony_Kennedy \"Anthony Kennedy\"). By tradition, when the\njustices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Court,\nthe justices state their views in order of seniority. The senior associate\njustice is also tasked with carrying out the chief justices's duties when he\nis unable to, or if that office is vacant.[4]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Current associate justices\n  * 2 Retired associate justices\n  * 3 List of associate justices\n    * 3.1 Notes\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 Further reading\n  * 7 External links\n\n## Current associate\njustices[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Current associate justices\")]\n\nCurrently, there are eight associate justices on the Court.

After retirement, they keep their title, and by custom may also keep a\nset of chambers in the Supreme Court building, and employ law clerks. The\nnames of retired associate justices continue to appear alongside those of the\nactive justices in the bound volumes of Supreme Court decisions. Federal\nstatute ([28 U.S.C.](/wiki/Title_28_of_the_United_States_Code \"Title 28 of the\nUnited States Code\") [§ 294](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/294))\nprovides that retired Supreme Court justices may serve—if designated and\nassigned by the chief justice—on panels of the U.S. courts of appeals, or on\nthe U.S. district courts. Retired justices are not, however, authorized to\ntake part in the consideration or decision of any cases before the Supreme\nCourt (unlike other retired federal judges who may be permitted do so in their\nformer courts); neither are they known or designated as a \"senior judge\".\nWhen, after his retirement, [William O. Douglas](/wiki/William_O._Douglas\n\"William O. Douglas\") attempted to take a more active role than was customary,\nmaintaining that it was his prerogative to do so because of his senior status,\nhe was rebuffed by Chief Justice [Warren Burger](/wiki/Warren_Burger \"Warren\nBurger\") and admonished by the whole Court.[5]\n\nCurrently, there are three living retired associate justices: [Sandra Day\nO'Connor](/wiki/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor \"Sandra Day O'Connor\"), retired January\n31, 2006; [David Souter](/wiki/David_Souter \"David Souter\"), retired June 29,\n2009; and [John Paul Stevens](/wiki/John_Paul_Stevens \"John Paul Stevens\"),\nretired June 29, 2010. Both O'Connor and Souter occasionally serve on panels\nof the Courts of Appeals of various circuits.
