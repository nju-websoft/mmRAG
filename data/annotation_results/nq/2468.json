Her counterpart in the\noriginal UK series of _[The Office](/wiki/The_Office_\\(UK\\) \"The Office\n\\(UK\\)\")_ is [Dawn Tinsley](/wiki/Dawn_Tinsley \"Dawn Tinsley\"). Her character\nis initially the receptionist at the paper distribution company [Dunder\nMifflin](/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin \"Dunder Mifflin\"), before becoming a saleswoman\nand eventually office administrator until her termination in the [series\nfinale](/wiki/Finale_\\(The_Office\\) \"Finale \\(The Office\\)\"). Her character is\nshy, growing assertive but amiable, and artistically inclined, and shares\nromantic interest with [Jim Halpert](/wiki/Jim_Halpert \"Jim Halpert\"), whom\nshe begins dating in the fourth season and marries and starts a family with as\nthe series continues.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Casting and character development\n  * 2 Character history\n    * 2.1 Seasons 1–3\n    * 2.2 Seasons 4–6\n    * 2.3 Season 7\n    * 2.4 Season 8\n    * 2.5 Season 9\n  * 3 Coworker relations\n    * 3.1 Jim Halpert\n    * 3.2 Roy Anderson\n    * 3.3 Michael Scott\n    * 3.4 Toby Flenderson\n  * 4 Appearances\n  * 5 References\n\n## Casting and character\ndevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Casting and character development\")]\n\nThe character was originally created to be very similar to the British\ncounterpart, Dawn Tinsley. Even minute details, such as how Pam wore her hair\neach day, were considered by executive producer, [Greg\nDaniels](/wiki/Greg_Daniels \"Greg Daniels\").[2]\n\n\"When I went in for _The Office_ , the casting director said to me, 'Please\nlook normal',\" recalls Jenna Fischer. \"Don't make yourself all pretty, and\ndare to bore me with your audition. Those were her words. Dare to bore me.\"[3]\n\nHeeding the advice, Fischer said little during the auditions, during which she\nwas interviewed in character by show producers, in an improvisational format,\nto imitate the show's documentary premise. \"My take on the character of Pam\nwas that she didn't have any media training, so she didn't know how to be a\ngood interview. And also, she didn't care about this interview,\" she told\n[NPR](/wiki/NPR \"NPR\"). \"So, I gave very short one-word answers and I tried\nvery hard not to be funny or clever, because I thought that the comedy would\ncome out of just, you know, the real human reactions to the situation...and\nthey liked that take on it.\"[3]\n\n\"When I went in to the audition, the first question that they asked me in the\ncharacter of Pam — they said, 'Do you like working as a receptionist?' I said,\n'No.' And that was it. I didn't speak any more than that. And they started\nlaughing.\"[3]\n\nFischer found herself creating a very elaborate [backstory](/wiki/Backstory\n\"Backstory\") for the character. For the first few seasons, she kept a list of\nthe character history revealed on-screen by the creators, as well as her own\nimaginative thoughts on Pam's history.[4] She created a rule with the set's\nhair and make-up department that it couldn't look as though it took Pam more\nthan 30 minutes to do her hair,[5] and she formulated ideas as to who gave Pam\neach piece of jewelry she wore [6] or where she went to college.[6] Fischer\nalso carefully crafted Pam's quiet persona. \"Well, my character of Pam is\nreally stuck,\" she explained to [NPR](/wiki/NPR \"NPR\"). \"I mean, she's a\nsubordinate in this office. And so, I think that for her, the only way she can\nexpress herself is in the silences, but you can say so much by not saying\nanything.\"[3]\n\nOriginally meek and passive, the character grew more assertive as the seasons\npassed, prompting Fischer to reassess her portrayal. \"I have to approach Pam\ndifferently [now],\" she explained in Season 4, a defining season in which her\ncharacter finally begins a long-awaited relationship with Jim and is accepted\ninto the [Pratt Institute](/wiki/Pratt_Institute \"Pratt Institute\"). \"She is\nin a loving relationship, she has found her voice, she has started taking art\nclasses. All of these things must inform the character and we need to see\nchanges in the way she moves, speaks, dresses, etc.\"[4]\n\n## Character\nhistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Character history\")]\n\n### Seasons 1–3[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Seasons 1–3\")]\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Pam and Roy have been dating for eight years\nand engaged for three years. Their open-ended engagement has become one of\nMichael's [running gags](/wiki/Running_gag \"Running gag\") and a sore spot for\nPam.\n\nPam does not want her current job to become permanent, remarking that \"I don't\nthink it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist.\" Pam is apathetic\ntoward her work, evidenced by her frequent games of [FreeCell](/wiki/FreeCell\n\"FreeCell\") on her office computer. However, in the pilot episode, she breaks\ndown crying when Michael pulls an ill-advised prank by telling her that she\nwill be fired.\n\nMichael has criticized Pam for simply forwarding calls to voice mail without\nanswering and (in a deleted scene) for not sounding enthusiastic enough when\nspeaking on the telephone. Pam is usually happy to abandon her work if asked\nto do something else by Jim. She will do extra, unnecessary work (such as\nmaking a casket for a dead bird or paper doves for the Office Olympics) to\nmake other people happy.\n\nDespite the abuse she takes from Michael, she never goes any further than\ncalling him a jerk in [the pilot](/wiki/Pilot_\\(The_Office\\) \"Pilot \\(The\nOffice\\)\"). In later seasons, however, she becomes more honest and forward\nwith Michael and will often make sarcastic comments toward him.\n\nWhile engaged to Roy, Pam denies, or is in denial about, having any romantic\nfeelings for Jim. When Jim confesses his love for her at the Dunder Mifflin\n\"[Casino Night](/wiki/Casino_Night \"Casino Night\")\" she turns him down. She\nlater talks to her mom on the phone and says Jim is her best friend (though\nshe doesn't say his name), and says \"Yeah, I think I am\" to an unheard\nquestion. She is interrupted by Jim, who enters and kisses her; she responds\nby kissing back.\n\nSeason three marks a turning point for Pam's character: she gains self-\nconfidence and appears less passive and more self-assured as the season\nprogresses. In \"[Gay Witch Hunt](/wiki/Gay_Witch_Hunt \"Gay Witch Hunt\"),\" the\nseason's opener, it is revealed that Pam got [cold\nfeet](/wiki/Cold_feet_\\(metaphor\\) \"Cold feet \\(metaphor\\)\") before her\nwedding and did not marry Roy after all, and that Jim transferred to a\ndifferent Dunder Mifflin branch, in Stamford, shortly after Pam rejected him a\nsecond time, after their kiss. Pam moves into her own apartment, begins taking\nart classes, a pursuit that Roy had previously dismissed as a waste of time,\nand buys a new car, a blue [Toyota Yaris](/wiki/Toyota_Yaris \"Toyota Yaris\").\nJim returns to Scranton later on as a result of \"[The\nMerger](/wiki/The_Merger_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Merger \\(The Office\\)\")\", and\nbrings along a female co-worker, [Karen Filippelli](/wiki/Karen_Filippelli\n\"Karen Filippelli\"), whom he begins dating. Jim and Pam appeared to have ended\nall communication after Jim transfers to the Stamford branch (aside from an\nepisode in which Jim accidentally calls Pam at the end of the work day), and\ntheir episodes together following the branch merge are tense, despite both\nadmitting to still harboring feelings for the other during the presence of the\ndocumentary cameras.\n\nMeanwhile, Roy vows to win Pam back. Roy's efforts to improve his relationship\nwith Pam are quite successful, but once Pam and Roy are back together, he\nfalls back into old habits almost immediately. When Roy and Pam attend an\nafter work get-together at a local bar with their co-workers, Pam, feeling\nthat she should be more honest with Roy, tells him about Jim kissing her at,\n\"[Casino Night](/wiki/Casino_Night \"Casino Night\").\" Roy yells, smashes a\nmirror, and trashes the bar. Pam, frightened and embarrassed by his reaction,\nbreaks up with Roy immediately. Roy vows to kill Jim and in, \"[The\nNegotiation](/wiki/The_Negotiation \"The Negotiation\")\", Roy unsuccessfully\ntries to attack Jim at work (Jim is saved by Dwight's intervention), and is\nsubsequently fired. Pam later reluctantly agrees to meet Roy for coffee at his\nrequest, and after the polite but brief meeting, it appears that their\nrelationship has ended amicably with Roy encouraging Pam to pursue Jim.\n\nPam participates in an art show, but few people attend. Her co-worker, Oscar,\nbrings his partner along who, not knowing that Pam is standing behind him,\ncriticizes her work by proclaiming that \"real art requires courage.\" Oscar\nthen goes on to say that courage isn't one of Pam's strong points. Affected by\nthis statement, Pam tells the documentary crew that she is going to be more\nhonest, culminating in a dramatic coal walk during the next-to-last episode of\nthe season, \"[Beach Games](/wiki/Beach_Games \"Beach Games\")\", and a seemingly\nsincere speech to Jim in front of the entire office about their relationship.\nMichael also comes to the art show and reveals his erratically kind heart and\nloyalty by buying, framing and hanging Pam's drawing of the Dunder Mifflin\nbuilding in the office. In the season finale, \"[The\nJob](/wiki/The_Job_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Job \\(The Office\\)\"),\" she leaves a\nfriendly note in Jim's briefcase and an old memento depicting the 'gold medal'\nyogurt lid from the Office Olympics, which he sees during an interview for a\njob at Corporate in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\").\nWhile he is asked how he \"would function here in New York\", Jim is shown to\nhave his mind back in Scranton, still distracted by the thought of Pam. Jim\nwithdraws his name from consideration and drives back to the office, where he\ninterrupts a talking head Pam is doing for the documentary crew by asking her\nout for dinner. She happily accepts, visibly moved, abandoning a train of\nthought about how she would be fine if Jim got the job and never came back to\nScranton. Karen quits soon after, becoming the regional manager at Dunder\nMifflin's Utica branch.\n\n### Seasons 4–6[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Seasons 4–6\")]\n\nIn Season 4, Pam retains the assertiveness she developed in the third season.\nShe wears her hair down and has updated her old dowdy wardrobe.\n\nIn the season 4 premiere, \"[Fun Run](/wiki/Fun_Run \"Fun Run\")\", Jim and Pam\nconfess that they have started dating after the camera crew catches them\nkissing. The office ultimately learns of their relationship in \"[Dunder\nMifflin Infinity](/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin_Infinity \"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\")\".\nIn \"[Chair Model](/wiki/Chair_Model_\\(The_Office_episode\\) \"Chair Model \\(The\nOffice episode\\)\")\", after teasing Pam about his impending proposal, Jim tells\nthe documentary crew he is not kidding around about an engagement and shows\nthem a ring he bought a week after he and Pam started dating. In the next few\nepisodes, Jim fake-proposes to Pam multiple times. In \"[Goodbye,\nToby](/wiki/Goodbye,_Toby \"Goodbye, Toby\")\", Pam discovers she's been accepted\nat [Pratt Institute](/wiki/Pratt_Institute \"Pratt Institute\"), an art and\ndesign school in Brooklyn . In an interview later in the episode, Jim\nannounces that he will propose to Pam that evening. Just as Jim is preparing\nto propose, however, [Andy Bernard](/wiki/Andy_Bernard \"Andy Bernard\") stands\nup and makes his own impromptu proposal to Angela. Having had his thunder\nstolen by Andy, Jim reluctantly puts the ring back in his jacket pocket,\nleaving Pam visibly disappointed as she was expecting Jim to propose that\nnight.\n\nIn the Season 5 premiere, \"[Weight Loss](/wiki/Weight_Loss_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"Weight Loss \\(The Office\\)\")\", Pam begins her three-month course at the\n[Pratt Institute](/wiki/Pratt_Institute \"Pratt Institute\"). In this episode,\nJim proposes in the pouring rain at a rest stop, saying that he \"can't wait\".\nIn \"[Business Trip](/wiki/Business_Trip \"Business Trip\")\", Pam learns that she\nis failing one of her classes and will have to remain in New York another\nthree months to retake it. Although Jim is supportive and tells her he will\nwait for her to come back \"the right way\", she ultimately makes the decision\nto return home, saying that she realized she hated graphic design and missed\nScranton. A deleted scene for the episode shows Jim looking through Pam's\ngraphic design projects, which he thinks are \"cool\", as well as a notebook\nfilled with pencil sketches, which he finds a lot more impressive than her\ngraphic design projects, implying her talents lie in hand-drawn works. In\n\"[Two Weeks](/wiki/Two_Weeks_\\(The_Office\\) \"Two Weeks \\(The Office\\)\")\", Pam\nagrees to become Michael's first saleswoman in his not-yet-established\ncompany, The Michael Scott Paper Co., as a supportive Jim looks on. When David\nWallace makes an offer to buy the company Michael negotiates in order to get\ntheir jobs at Dunder Mifflin back instead, including adding Pam to the sales\nteam. In \"[Company Picnic](/wiki/Company_Picnic \"Company Picnic\")\", Pam, after\ndominating the company volleyball tournament, injures her ankle during a game\nand is taken to the hospital against her wishes. At the hospital, the camera\ncrew is stationed outside an exam room while a doctor updates Jim and Pam on\nher condition. There is no audio as the camera shows Jim and Pam embrace,\nlooking shocked and ecstatic. It is implied that she is pregnant and is\nconfirmed in the Season 6 premiere, \"[Gossip](/wiki/Gossip_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"Gossip \\(The Office\\)\")\".\n\nJim and Pam marry early in the season, at [Niagara Falls](/wiki/Niagara_Falls\n\"Niagara Falls\"), during the highly anticipated, hour long episode,\n\"[Niagara](/wiki/Niagara_\\(The_Office\\) \"Niagara \\(The Office\\)\")\". The ending\nof the episode, in which their co-workers dance down the aisle, is an\nimitation of a viral YouTube video — [JK Wedding Entrance\nDance](/wiki/JK_Wedding_Entrance_Dance \"JK Wedding Entrance Dance\").[7]\nFollowing the wedding, a multi-episode story arc begins in which it is\nrevealed that Michael hooked up with Pam's mother the night of the wedding.\nThe two break up during \"[Double Date](/wiki/Double_Date_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"Double Date \\(The Office\\)\")\", an episode that ends with Pam slapping Michael\nin response to his actions.\n\nIn \"[The Delivery](/wiki/The_Delivery_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Delivery \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\" of Season 6, Pam and Jim have their first child, a daughter named\nCecelia Marie Halpert. Jenna Fischer was granted naming rights by show\nproducers, and chose to name her after her own niece.[8]\n\n### Season 7[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Season 7\")]\n\nIn \"[Counseling](/wiki/Counseling_\\(The_Office\\) \"Counseling \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", Pam feels inadequate about her poor performance in sales and\ntricks Gabe into promoting her to a phony new [salaried](/wiki/Salary\n\"Salary\") position called office administrator. In\n\"[China](/wiki/China_\\(The_Office\\) \"China \\(The Office\\)\")\", Pam tries to use\nher authority as office administrator to force building manager Dwight to stop\nhis annoying cost-cutting measures. Pam threatens to move the office to a new\nbuilding, which Dwight discovers doesn't exist. Pam [saves\nface](/wiki/Face_\\(sociological_concept\\) \"Face \\(sociological concept\\)\"),\nhowever, when Dwight secretly has his assistant provide her with a book on\nbuilding regulations that proves Dwight's measures were not allowed. The\nepisode is another example of Dwight's [covert](/wiki/Covert \"Covert\")\nprotectiveness and fondness for Pam (as previously demonstrated in \"[The\nInjury](/wiki/The_Injury \"The Injury\")\", \"[Back from\nVacation](/wiki/Back_from_Vacation \"Back from Vacation\")\", \"[The\nJob](/wiki/The_Job_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Job \\(The Office\\)\")\" and\n\"[Diwali](/wiki/Diwali_\\(The_Office\\) \"Diwali \\(The Office\\)\")\"); Mindy Kaling\nsaid during an online Q&A session that Dwight has a soft spot for her that he\ndoes not extend to anyone else at the office. She also uses her position to\nbuy [Erin Hannon](/wiki/Erin_Hannon \"Erin Hannon\") an expensive desk top\ncomputer to replace the terrible one she had to use for years, as well as\ndiscreetly giving Andy a new computer, and giving Darell three sick days. At\nthe end of the episode she proudly says that she is, \"Full on corrupt.\"\n\nIn \"[Goodbye, Michael](/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael \"Goodbye, Michael\")\", Pam almost\nmisses saying good-bye to Michael, as she spends most of the day out of the\noffice trying to price shredders. Jim figures out Michael's plan to leave\nearly and tells her by text. Pam reaches the airport in time and is the last\nperson to see Michael before he leaves.\n\n### Season 8[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Season 8\")]\n\nAt the beginning of Season 8, Pam is revealed to be pregnant with her and\nJim's second child, Philip Halpert. The child coincided with [Jenna\nFischer](/wiki/Jenna_Fischer \"Jenna Fischer\")'s actual pregnancy. She begins\nher maternity leave after \"[Pam's Replacement](/wiki/Pam%27s_Replacement\n\"Pam's Replacement\")\". Pam returns in \"[Jury\nDuty](/wiki/Jury_Duty_\\(The_Office\\) \"Jury Duty \\(The Office\\)\")\", where she\nand Jim bring Cece and Phillip into the office. In both\n\"[Tallahassee](/wiki/Tallahassee_\\(The_Office\\) \"Tallahassee \\(The Office\\)\")\"\nand \"[Test the Store](/wiki/Test_the_Store \"Test the Store\")\" Pam is shown\nhelping, and developing her friendship with Andy.\n\n### Season 9[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Season 9\")]\n\nEarly in season 9, Jim is restless about his life in Scranton and helps a\nfriend start a Sports Marketing business, Athlead, in\n[Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\") but he keeps it a secret\nfrom Pam until the third episode \"[Andy's Ancestry](/wiki/Andy%27s_Ancestry\n\"Andy's Ancestry\")\". Although Pam is happy for his decision, she is concerned\nabout the fact that he had kept it a secret from her and she is later\ndisturbed to hear about just how much of their money he had invested. Jim\nbegins spending part of each work week in Philadelphia, but in \"[Customer\nLoyalty](/wiki/Customer_Loyalty_\\(The_Office\\) \"Customer Loyalty \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", the strain of this on Pam is evident when she breaks down in\ntears, and is comforted by Brian, the [boom mic](/wiki/Boom_mic \"Boom mic\")\noperator of the film crew.\n\nIn \"[Moving On](/wiki/Moving_On_\\(The_Office\\) \"Moving On \\(The Office\\)\")\",\nPam interviews for a job in Philadelphia to be closer to Jim, but she is\nturned off by the idea when her prospective new boss bears a striking\nresemblance in behavior to Michael Scott. Over dinner, Pam reveals to Jim that\nshe doesn't really want to move to Philadelphia after all. However, in\n\"[Livin' the Dream](/wiki/Livin%27_the_Dream \"Livin' the Dream\")\", when\nAthlead is bought out and Jim is offered a large sum of money for 3 months to\npitch the company across the country, Pam overhears Jim refuse the opportunity\nbecause of her and appears to have mixed feelings about this decision. In\n\"[A.A.R.M.](/wiki/A.A.R.M. \"A.A.R.M.\")\", Pam tells Jim that she's afraid that\nhe will resent her for making him stay and that she might not be enough for\nhim. Jim asks the camera crew to compile documentary footage of the two of\nthem to show her. When she finishes the montage, which shows Jim taking back a\nletter he intended to give her with his [teapot gift during\nChristmas](/wiki/Christmas_Party_\\(The_Office\\)#Plot \"Christmas Party \\(The\nOffice\\)\"); Jim finally gives her that letter, and she reads it, visibly\nmoved. In the [series finale](/wiki/Finale_\\(The_Office\\) \"Finale \\(The\nOffice\\)\"), which takes place a year later, she reveals to Jim that she\nsecretly put the house on the market, so that they can move to Austin, Texas,\nand take his job back at Athlead (now Athleap).\n\n## Coworker\nrelations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Coworker relations\")]\n\nFrom her years working the front desk, Pam has become well-acquainted with the\nDunder-Mifflin staff and is consistently shown to have a thorough\nunderstanding of her coworkers' personalities, including the more eccentric\nindividuals Dwight Schrute and Michael Scott. She uses this familiarity to\nmanipulate them, often for their and the company's best interests (such as her\ngiving the staff elaborate instructions on how to handle a heartbroken Michael\nin \"[The Chump](/wiki/The_Chump \"The Chump\")\") but also occasionally for her\nown. This familiarity plays a large part in her efficiency as office\nadministrator and was crucial to her being promoted to the previously non-\nexistent position.\n\n### Jim Halpert[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Jim Halpert\")]\n\nMain article: [Jim Halpert](/wiki/Jim_Halpert \"Jim Halpert\")\n\nThe \"will they or won't they\" tension between Jim and Pam is a strong\nstoryline in the early episodes of _The Office_ , encompassing much of Seasons\n1 to 3. In the opener of Season 4, the two characters are revealed to be\ndating, and as such, other character romances, such as the romance between\nfellow co-workers Dwight Schrute and [Angela Martin](/wiki/Angela_Martin\n\"Angela Martin\"), begin to move more toward the forefront of episodes. In\nSeason 6, Jim and Pam are married in the season's 4th and 5th episodes (hour\nlong), a feat considered noteworthy by many television critics, as bringing\ntogether the two lead love interests in a television series is often thought\nto be a risky venture.[9] Their child is born in the second half of the\nseason, during another hour long, \"[The\nDelivery](/wiki/The_Delivery_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Delivery \\(The Office\\)\")\".\nPam and Jim's second child is born during season 8. In season 9, their\nmarriage becomes strained when Jim takes up a second job in Philadelphia. They\nultimately decide to leave Dunder Mifflin together so Jim can pursue his dream\njob.\n\n### Roy Anderson[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Roy Anderson\")]\n\nMain article: [Roy Anderson (The Office)](/wiki/Roy_Anderson_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"Roy Anderson \\(The Office\\)\")\n\nWhen the series begins, Pam is engaged to her high school sweetheart Roy\nAnderson; this engagement is revealed to be three years old and running. They\nfinally set a date, but Pam calls off the wedding at the last minute. They get\nback together once, briefly, but Pam is much more assertive, and finally\nbreaks up with him after he has a violent outburst. Roy is deeply flawed - he\nis overbearing, neglectful, dismissive of her desire to be an artist, and\noffers her sex as a gift on Valentine's Day. Jim comments in Season 2 that Pam\ndoes not like to \"bother\" Roy with her \"thoughts or feelings\". He tells the\ncamera crew that the only two problems in Pam's life seemed to be Roy and her\njob at Dunder Mifflin.\n\nIn the early seasons, there is a great deal of tension between Jim and Roy,\nwith Roy often acting threateningly towards Jim. In\n\"[Basketball](/wiki/Basketball_\\(The_Office\\) \"Basketball \\(The Office\\)\")\",\nwhen Jim starts to impress Pam with his basketball skills, Roy elbows Jim in\nthe nose. In season 2, when Jim encourages Pam to pursue a graphic arts\ninternship offered by Dunder Mifflin, Roy objects to the opportunity and\neventually convinces her that the idea is foolish. Pam ultimately calls off\nher wedding to Roy, but they remain friendly and he is determined to win her\nback by being less of a jerk. She reconciles with Roy at Phyllis's wedding as\na response to watching Jim date Karen. In an attempt at a fresh start with\nRoy, Pam comes clean about Jim kissing her during \"[Casino\nNight](/wiki/Casino_Night \"Casino Night\")\". Roy flies into a violent rage and\nPam ends the relationship on the spot. The next day, Roy attempts to attack\nJim in the office but is stopped by Dwight's pepper spray and is summarily\nfired. After losing his job, Roy meets Pam for coffee and says that even\nthough Jim is dating Karen, she should at least make an effort to date him\n(inasmuch as she called off the wedding because of him).\n\nIn season 5, Jim and Roy run into each other at a bar and Roy learns that Jim\nand Pam are engaged. The mood is somewhat awkward, but Roy is congratulatory,\nbut then makes a somewhat passive-aggressive comment, seemingly meant to make\nJim feel insecure about his current role in Pam's life, which tempts him to\ndrive to Pratt, where she is attending art classes. Jim gets on the freeway,\nbut changes his mind and remembers that he trusts Pam. Jim didn't want to\ntreat Pam the same way Roy treated her.\n\n### Michael Scott[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Michael Scott\")]\n\nMain article: [Michael Scott (The Office)](/wiki/Michael_Scott_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"Michael Scott \\(The Office\\)\")\n\nIn the series pilot, Michael is overtly rude to Pam and at one point fakes her\nfiring, leaving her in tears. He often makes suggestive if harmless remarks\nabout her beauty and general appearance, and at one point lies to the camera\nthat they used to date (inspiring a horrified \"WHAT???\" from Pam when an\ninterviewer relays the message to her). However, his impulsive attempt to kiss\nher during [Diwali](/wiki/Diwali \"Diwali\") is shot down and marked the end of\nany romantic dreams for Michael with Pam. Over time, the combination of\nMichael being supportive of her goals, her transition from a bad relationship\nwith Roy to a great one with Jim as well as her finding a job she not only\nenjoys but is effective at in the office administrator position and Michael\nfinding his own soulmate in [Holly Flax](/wiki/Holly_Flax \"Holly Flax\") made\nPam soften her stance towards Michael, and the experience at the Michael Scott\nPaper Company further bonded them (as did Michael's decision to choose Pam\ninstead of [Ryan Howard](/wiki/Ryan_Howard_\\(The_Office\\) \"Ryan Howard \\(The\nOffice\\)\") as the only MSPC salesman to keep that job when Michael returned as\nBranch Manager). Pam was furious at Michael for dating her mom Helene, and\nexcoriated him at length during \"[The Lover](/wiki/The_Lover_\\(The_Office\\)\n\"The Lover \\(The Office\\)\")\" before eventually slapping him in \"[Double\nDate](/wiki/Double_Date \"Double Date\")\", but they once again were able to be\ncivil to each other afterward. Pam does set up boundaries around her personal\nlife that Michael can't cross, like telling him that he wasn't Cece's\ngodfather. By Season 7, Pam acts as something of a [guardian\nangel](/wiki/Guardian_angel \"Guardian angel\") for Michael, steering him away\nfrom (numerous) bad ideas and towards his (fewer but real) good ones, such as\nhis successful efforts to propose to Holly. In Michael's finale \"[Goodbye,\nMichael](/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael \"Goodbye, Michael\")\", Pam spends the whole day\nlooking for a shredder, believing that the next day Michael was leaving. As\nMichael takes off his microphone and heads down the airport concourse, Pam\nruns to him with no shoes and hugs him as he kisses her cheek. The two have a\nnice moment and he walks off, leaving her holding her shoes. She then tells\nthe camera that he was happy, wanting to be an advanced rewards member, and\nwas glad to be going home to see Holly. She then is there to watch Michael's\nplane take off. In a deleted scene from \"[The Inner\nCircle](/wiki/The_Inner_Circle_\\(The_Office\\) \"The Inner Circle \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", we learn Pam is flattered that Michael named his new puppy\n\"Pamela Beagsley\", and in \"The List\" she playfully teases Jim by calling their\nsecond child \"Little Michael Scott\", further proving that the two have\ndeveloped a genuine friendship.\n\n### Toby\nFlenderson[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Toby Flenderson\")]\n\nMain article: [Toby Flenderson](/wiki/Toby_Flenderson \"Toby Flenderson\")\n\nToby, the [Human Resources](/wiki/Human_Resources \"Human Resources\")\nRepresentative for Dunder Mifflin in the Scranton branch, has a secret crush\non Pam. In \"[A Benihana Christmas](/wiki/A_Benihana_Christmas \"A Benihana\nChristmas\")\" she gives him her Dunder-Mifflin bathrobe, a display of friendly\naffection, after he spent the day feeling bad that Dwight took his. In \"[Night\nOut](/wiki/Night_Out_\\(The_Office\\) \"Night Out \\(The Office\\)\")\", Toby\nawkwardly rubs her knee while they share a laugh (and while Jim sits just on\nher other side), and the rest of the office watches in horror. In his\nmortification, Toby immediately announces that he is moving to [Costa\nRica](/wiki/Costa_Rica \"Costa Rica\") before jumping over the locked gate and\nfleeing. In \"[Goodbye, Toby](/wiki/Goodbye,_Toby \"Goodbye, Toby\")\", he\npurchases a [DSLR camera](/wiki/DSLR_camera \"DSLR camera\") just to get a\npicture with Pam. On the eve of his departure, she confesses to the cameras\nthat she always thought he was \"kind of cute\". The crush receives less\nattention after Toby's return. However, in\n\"[Niagara](/wiki/Niagara_\\(The_Office\\) \"Niagara \\(The Office\\)\")\", Pam and\nJim are late for their wedding and he is visibly excited at the prospect that\nthe wedding might not happen. In \"[Finale](/wiki/Finale_\\(The_Office\\) \"Finale\n\\(The Office\\)\")\", Pam and Toby dance with each other at Dwight's wedding,\nwith Toby beginning to cry as Pam comforts him. When she asks, \"is it me?\", he\nreplies that \"it's everything!\".\n\n## Appearances[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Appearances\")]\n\nPam Halpert has appeared in every episode with the exceptions of \"[Business\nEthics](/wiki/Business_Ethics_\\(The_Office\\) \"Business Ethics \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\" (except for the deleted scenes), \"[St. Patrick's\nDay](/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_Day_\\(The_Office\\) \"St. Patrick's Day \\(The\nOffice\\)\")\", and \"[New Leads](/wiki/New_Leads \"New Leads\")\" in which only her\nvoice is heard, and several season 8 episodes from \"[Mrs.\nCalifornia](/wiki/Mrs._California \"Mrs. California\")\" to \"[Pool\nParty](/wiki/Pool_Party_\\(The_Office\\) \"Pool Party \\(The Office\\)\")\", where\nshe did not appear at all as Fischer was on maternity leave.[10]\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pam_Beesly&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [\"Halpert Baby Blog\"](http://www.halpertbeesly.com/baby).
