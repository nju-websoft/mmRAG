Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the\n[tallest man-made\nstructure](/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_the_world#History\n\"List of tallest buildings and structures in the world\") in the world for more\nthan 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones\nthat formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core\nstructure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still\nbe seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative\ntheories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted\nconstruction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge\nstones from a [quarry](/wiki/Quarry \"Quarry\") and dragging and lifting them\ninto place.\n\nThere are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is\ncut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was unfinished. The\nso-called[2] Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber are higher up within the\npyramid structure. The main part of the Giza complex is a setting of buildings\nthat included two [mortuary temples](/wiki/Mortuary_temples \"Mortuary\ntemples\") in honour of Khufu (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile),\nthree smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller \"satellite\" pyramid,\na raised causeway connecting the two temples, and small\n[mastaba](/wiki/Mastaba \"Mastaba\") tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/007_Khufu.jpg/220px-007_Khufu.jpg)](/wiki/File:007_Khufu.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:007_Khufu.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nTransparent view of Khufu's pyramid from SE.

Khufu's [vizier](/wiki/Vizier_\\(Ancient_Egypt\\) \"Vizier \\(Ancient\nEgypt\\)\"), [Hemiunu](/wiki/Hemiunu \"Hemiunu\") (also called Hemon), is believed\nby some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid.[3] It is thought that, at\nconstruction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian\n[cubits](/wiki/Cubit \"Cubit\") tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with\n[erosion](/wiki/Erosion \"Erosion\") and absence of its\n[pyramidion](/wiki/Pyramidion \"Pyramidion\"), its present height is 138.8\nmetres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 [cubits](/wiki/Cubit \"Cubit\"), 230.4\nmetres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million\n[tonnes](/wiki/Tonne \"Tonne\"). The volume, including an internal hillock, is\nroughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft).[4]\n\nBased on these estimates, building the pyramid in 20 years would involve\ninstalling approximately 800 tonnes of stone every day. Additionally, since it\nconsists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks, completing the building in 20\nyears would involve moving an average of more than 12 of the blocks into place\neach hour, day and night. The first precision measurements of the pyramid were\nmade by [Egyptologist](/wiki/Egyptology \"Egyptology\") [Sir Flinders\nPetrie](/wiki/Flinders_Petrie \"Flinders Petrie\") in 1880–82 and published as\n_The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh_.[5] Almost all reports are based on his\nmeasurements. Many of the casing stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great\nPyramid fit together with extremely high precision. Based on measurements\ntaken on the northeastern casing stones, the mean opening of the joints is\nonly 0.5 millimetre wide (1/50 of an inch).[6]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/PyramidDatePalms.jpg/220px-\nPyramidDatePalms.jpg)](/wiki/File:PyramidDatePalms.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PyramidDatePalms.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGreat Pyramid of Giza from a 19th-century [stereopticon](/wiki/Stereopticon\n\"Stereopticon\") card [photo](/wiki/Photo \"Photo\")\n\nThe pyramid remained the [tallest man-made\nstructure](/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_the_world#History\n\"List of tallest buildings and structures in the world\") in the world for over\n3,800 years,[7] unsurpassed until the 160-metre-tall (520 ft) spire of\n[Lincoln Cathedral](/wiki/Lincoln_Cathedral \"Lincoln Cathedral\") was completed\nc. 1300. The accuracy of the pyramid's workmanship is such that the four sides\nof the base have an average error of only 58 millimetres in length.[8] The\nbase is horizontal and flat to within ±15 mm (0.6 in).[9] The sides of the\nsquare base are closely aligned to the four cardinal compass points (within\nfour [minutes of arc](/wiki/Minute_of_arc \"Minute of arc\"))[10] based on [true\nnorth](/wiki/True_north \"True north\"), not [magnetic\nnorth](/wiki/Magnetic_north \"Magnetic north\"),[11] and the finished base was\nsquared to a mean corner error of only 12 [seconds of arc](/wiki/Second_of_arc\n\"Second of arc\").[12]\n\nThe completed design dimensions, as suggested by Petrie's survey and\nsubsequent studies, are estimated to have originally been 280 royal\n[cubits](/wiki/Cubit \"Cubit\") high by 440 cubits long at each of the four\nsides of its base. The ratio of the perimeter to height of 1760/280 royal\ncubits equates to 2[π](/wiki/Pi \"Pi\") to an accuracy of better than 0.05%\n(corresponding to the well-known approximation of π as 22/7). Some\nEgyptologists consider this to have been the result of deliberate design\nproportion. Verner wrote, \"We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians\ncould not precisely define the value of π, in practice they used it\".[13]\nPetrie, author of _Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh_ concluded: \"but these\nrelations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should\ngrant that they were in the builder's design\".[14] Others have argued that the\nAncient Egyptians had no concept of [pi](/wiki/Pi \"Pi\") and would not have\nthought to encode it in their monuments. They believe that the observed\npyramid slope may be based on a simple [seked](/wiki/Seked \"Seked\") slope\nchoice alone, with no regard to the overall size and proportions of the\nfinished building.[15] In 2013 rolls of papyrus called [The diary of\nMerer](/wiki/The_diary_of_Merer \"The diary of Merer\") were discovered written\nby some of those who delivered stone and other construction materials to\nKhufu's brother at Giza.[16]\n\n## Materials\n\nThe Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks which most\nbelieve to have been transported from nearby [quarries](/wiki/Quarry\n\"Quarry\"). The Tura [limestone](/wiki/Limestone \"Limestone\") used for the\ncasing was quarried across the river. The largest [granite](/wiki/Granite\n\"Granite\") stones in the pyramid, found in the \"King's\" chamber, weigh 25 to\n80 [tonnes](/wiki/Tonne \"Tonne\") and were transported from [Aswan](/wiki/Aswan\n\"Aswan\"), more than 800 km (500 mi) away. Traditionally, ancient Egyptians cut\nstone blocks by hammering into them some wooden wedges, which were then soaked\nwith water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, causing the rock\nto crack. Once they were cut, they were carried by boat either up or down the\n[Nile River](/wiki/Nile_River \"Nile River\") to the pyramid.[17] It is\nestimated that 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite\n(imported from Aswan), and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the\nconstruction of the Great Pyramid.[18]\n\n### Casing stones\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/KhufuPyramidCasingStone-\nBritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg/220px-KhufuPyramidCasingStone-BritishMuseum-\nAugust19-08.jpg)](/wiki/File:KhufuPyramidCasingStone-BritishMuseum-\nAugust19-08.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:KhufuPyramidCasingStone-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nCasing stone in the [British Museum](/wiki/British_Museum \"British\nMuseum\").[19]\n\nAt completion, the Great Pyramid was surfaced by white \"casing stones\" –\nslant-faced, but flat-topped, blocks of highly polished white\n[limestone](/wiki/Limestone \"Limestone\"). These were carefully cut to what is\napproximately a face slope with a [seked](/wiki/Seked \"Seked\") of 5½ palms to\ngive the required dimensions. Visibly, all that remains is the underlying\nstepped core structure seen today. In AD 1303, a [massive\nearthquake](/wiki/1303_Crete_earthquake \"1303 Crete earthquake\") loosened many\nof the outer casing stones, which were then carted away by [Bahri\nSultan](/wiki/Bahri_dynasty \"Bahri dynasty\") An-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan in\n1356 to build mosques and fortresses in nearby [Cairo](/wiki/Cairo \"Cairo\").\nMany more casing stones were removed from the great pyramids by Muhammad Ali\nPasha in the early 19th century to build the upper portion of his [Alabaster\nMosque](/wiki/Alabaster_Mosque \"Alabaster Mosque\") in Cairo not far from Giza.\nThese limestone casings can still be seen as parts of these structures. Later\nexplorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left\nover from the continuing collapse of the casing stones, which were\nsubsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site.\n\nNevertheless, a few of the casing stones from the lowest course can be seen to\nthis day _[in situ](/wiki/In_situ_conservation_\\(archaeology\\) \"In situ\nconservation \\(archaeology\\)\")_ around the base of the Great Pyramid, and\ndisplay the same workmanship and precision that has been reported for\ncenturies. [Petrie](/wiki/Sir_Flinders_Petrie \"Sir Flinders Petrie\") also\nfound a different orientation in the core and in the casing measuring 193\ncentimetres ± 25 centimetres. He suggested a redetermination of north was made\nafter the construction of the core, but a mistake was made, and the casing was\nbuilt with a different orientation.[5] Petrie related the precision of the\ncasing stones as to being \"equal to opticians' work of the present day, but on\na scale of acres\" and \"to place such stones in exact contact would be careful\nwork; but to do so with cement in the joints seems almost impossible\".[20] It\nhas been suggested it was the mortar (Petrie's \"cement\") that made this\nseemingly impossible task possible, providing a level bed, which enabled the\nmasons to set the stones exactly.[21][22]\n\n### Construction theories\n\nMain article: [Egyptian pyramid construction\ntechniques](/wiki/Egyptian_pyramid_construction_techniques \"Egyptian pyramid\nconstruction techniques\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Khufu_seal.jpg/220px-\nKhufu_seal.jpg)](/wiki/File:Khufu_seal.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Khufu_seal.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nClay seal bearing the name of Khufu from the great pyramid. On display at the\n[Musée du Louvre](/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_du_Louvre \"Musée du Louvre\").\n\nMany alternative, often contradictory, theories have been proposed regarding\nthe pyramid's construction techniques.[23] Many disagree on whether the blocks\nwere dragged, lifted, or even rolled into place. The\n[Greeks](/wiki/Ancient_Greece \"Ancient Greece\") believed that slave labour was\nused, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers' camps associated with\nconstruction at Giza suggest that it was built instead by tens of thousands of\nskilled workers. Verner posited that the labour was organized into a\n[hierarchy](/wiki/Hierarchy \"Hierarchy\"), consisting of two _gangs_ of 100,000\nmen, divided into five _zaa_ or _[phyle](/wiki/Phyle \"Phyle\")_ of 20,000 men\neach, which may have been further divided according to the skills of the\nworkers.[24]\n\nOne mystery of the pyramid's construction is its planning. [John\nRomer](/wiki/John_Romer_\\(Egyptologist\\) \"John Romer \\(Egyptologist\\)\")\nsuggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and\nlater constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1\nscale. He writes that \"such a working diagram would also serve to generate the\narchitecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means\".[25]\nHe also argues for a 14-year time span for its construction.[26] A modern\nconstruction management study, in association with [Mark\nLehner](/wiki/Mark_Lehner \"Mark Lehner\") and other Egyptologists, estimated\nthat the total project required an average workforce of 14,567 people and a\npeak workforce of roughly 40,000. Without the use of pulleys, wheels, or iron\ntools, they used [critical path analysis](/wiki/Critical_path_analysis\n\"Critical path analysis\") methods, which suggest that the Great Pyramid was\ncompleted from start to finish in approximately 10 years.[27]\n\n## Interior\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Great_Pyramid_Diagram.svg/220px-\nGreat_Pyramid_Diagram.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Great_Pyramid_Diagram.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Great_Pyramid_Diagram.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDiagram of the interior structures of the Great Pyramid. The inner line\nindicates the pyramid's present profile; the outer line indicates the original\nprofile.\n\nThe original entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north, 17 metres (56 ft)\nvertically above ground level and 7.29 metres (23.9 ft) east of the centre\nline of the pyramid. From this original entrance, there is a Descending\nPassage 0.96 metres (3.1 ft) high and 1.04 metres (3.4 ft) wide, which goes\ndown at an angle of 26° 31'23\" through the masonry of the pyramid and then\ninto the bedrock beneath it. After 105.23 metres (345.2 ft), the passage\nbecomes level and continues for an additional 8.84 metres (29.0 ft) to the\nlower Chamber, which appears not to have been finished. There is a\ncontinuation of the horizontal passage in the south wall of the lower chamber;\nthere is also a pit dug in the floor of the chamber. Some Egyptologists\nsuggest that this Lower Chamber was intended to be the original burial\nchamber, but Pharaoh Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher\nup in the pyramid.[28]\n\n28.2 metres (93 ft) from the entrance is a square hole in the roof of the\nDescending Passage. Originally concealed with a slab of stone, this is the\nbeginning of the Ascending Passage. The Ascending Passage is 39.3 metres (129\nft) long, as wide and high as the Descending Passage and slopes up at almost\nprecisely the same angle to reach the Grand Gallery. The lower end of the\nAscending Passage is closed by three huge blocks of granite, each about 1.5\nmetres (4.9 ft) long. One must use the Robbers' Tunnel (see below) to access\nthe Ascending Passage. At the start of the Grand Gallery on the right-hand\nside there is a hole cut in the wall. This is the start of a vertical shaft\nwhich follows an irregular path through the masonry of the pyramid to join the\nDescending Passage. Also at the start of the Grand Gallery there is the\nHorizontal Passage leading to the \"Queen's Chamber\". The passage is 1.1m\n(3'8\") high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in\nthe floor, after which the passage is 1.73 metres (5.7 ft) high.\n\n### Queen's Chamber\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Richard_Pococke_Cheopspyramiden.JPG/220px-\nRichard_Pococke_Cheopspyramiden.JPG)](/wiki/File:Richard_Pococke_Cheopspyramiden.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Richard_Pococke_Cheopspyramiden.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Richard Pococke](/wiki/Richard_Pococke \"Richard Pococke\")'s sketch of Pyramid\nof Cheops from 1754.\n\nThe \"Queen's Chamber\"[2] is exactly halfway between the north and south faces\nof the pyramid and measures 5.75 metres (18.9 ft) north to south, 5.23 metres\n(17.2 ft) east to west, and has a pointed roof with an apex 6.23 metres (20.4\nft) above the floor. At the eastern end of the chamber there is a\n[niche](/wiki/Niche_\\(architecture\\) \"Niche \\(architecture\\)\") 4.67 metres\n(15.3 ft) high. The original depth of the niche was 1.04 metres (3.4 ft), but\nhas since been deepened by treasure hunters.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn the north and south walls of the Queen's Chamber there are shafts, which\nunlike those in the King's Chamber that immediately slope upwards (see below),\nare horizontal for around 2 m (6.6 ft) before sloping upwards. The horizontal\ndistance was cut in 1872 by a British engineer, Waynman Dixon, who believed a\nshaft similar to those in the King's Chamber must also exist. He was proved\nright, but because the shafts are not connected to the outer faces of the\npyramid or the Queen's Chamber, their purpose is unknown. At the end of one of\nhis shafts, Dixon discovered a ball of black [diorite](/wiki/Diorite\n\"Diorite\") (a type of rock) and a bronze implement of unknown purpose. Both\nobjects are currently in the British Museum.[29]\n\nThe shafts in the Queen's Chamber were explored in 1993 by the German engineer\nRudolf Gantenbrink using a crawler robot he designed, _[Upuaut\n2](/wiki/Upuaut_2 \"Upuaut 2\")_. After a climb of 65 m (213 ft),[30] he\ndiscovered that one of the shafts was blocked by limestone \"doors\" with two\neroded copper \"handles\". Some years later the [National Geographic\nSociety](/wiki/National_Geographic_Society \"National Geographic Society\")\ncreated a similar robot which, in September 2002, drilled a small hole in the\nsouthern door, only to find another door behind it.[31] The northern passage,\nwhich was difficult to navigate because of twists and turns, was also found to\nbe blocked by a door.[32]\n\nResearch continued in 2011 with the [Djedi Project](/wiki/Djedi_Project \"Djedi\nProject\"). Realizing the problem was that the [National Geographic\nSociety](/wiki/National_Geographic_Society \"National Geographic Society\")'s\ncamera was only able to see straight ahead of it, they instead used a fiber-\noptic \"[micro snake camera](/wiki/Fiberscope \"Fiberscope\")\" that could see\naround corners. With this they were able to penetrate the first door of the\nsouthern shaft through the hole drilled in 2002, and view all the sides of the\nsmall chamber behind it. They discovered hieroglyphs written in red paint.\nThey were also able to scrutinize the inside of the two copper \"handles\"\nembedded in the door, and they now believe them to be for decorative purposes.\nThey also found the reverse side of the \"door\" to be finished and polished,\nwhich suggests that it was not put there just to block the shaft from debris,\nbut rather for a more specific reason.[33]\n\n### Grand Gallery\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Cheops_grote_galerij.jpg/170px-\nCheops_grote_galerij.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cheops_grote_galerij.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cheops_grote_galerij.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid of Giza\n\nThe Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage, but is 8.6\nmetres (28 ft) high and 46.68 metres (153.1 ft) long. At the base it is 2.06\nmetres (6.8 ft) wide, but after 2.29 metres (7.5 ft) the blocks of stone in\nthe walls are [corbelled](/wiki/Corbelled \"Corbelled\") inwards by 7.6\ncentimetres (3.0 in) on each side. There are seven of these steps, so, at the\ntop, the Grand Gallery is only 1.04 metres (3.4 ft) wide. It is roofed by\nslabs of stone laid at a slightly steeper angle than the floor of the gallery,\nso that each stone fits into a slot cut in the top of the gallery like the\nteeth of a [ratchet](/wiki/Ratchet_\\(device\\) \"Ratchet \\(device\\)\"). The\npurpose was to have each block supported by the wall of the Gallery rather\nthan resting on the block beneath it, which would have resulted in an\nunacceptable cumulative pressure at the lower end of the Gallery.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAt the upper end of the Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole near\nthe roof that opens into a short tunnel by which access can be gained to the\nlowest of the Relieving Chambers. The other Relieving Chambers were discovered\nin 1837-1838 by [Colonel Howard Vyse](/wiki/Richard_William_Howard_Vyse\n\"Richard William Howard Vyse\") and [J. S. Perring](/wiki/John_Shae_Perring\n\"John Shae Perring\"), who dug tunnels upwards using blasting powder.\n\nThe floor of the Grand Gallery consists of a shelf or step on either side, 51\ncentimetres (20 in) wide, leaving a lower ramp 1.04 metres (3.4 ft) wide\nbetween them. In the shelves there are 54 slots, 27 on each side matched by\nvertical and horizontal slots in the walls of the Gallery. These form a cross\nshape that rises out of the slot in the shelf. The purpose of these slots is\nnot known, but the central gutter in the floor of the Gallery, which is the\nsame width as the Ascending Passage, has led to speculation that the blocking\nstones were stored in the Grand Gallery and the slots held wooden beams to\nrestrain them from sliding down the passage.[34] This, in turn, has led to the\nproposal that originally many more than 3 blocking stones were intended, to\ncompletely fill the Ascending Passage.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nAt the top of the Grand Gallery, there is a step giving onto a horizontal\npassage some metres long and approximately 1.02 metres (3.3 ft) in height and\nwidth, in which can be detected four slots, three of which were probably\nintended to hold granite [portcullises](/wiki/Portcullises \"Portcullises\").\nFragments of granite found by [Petrie](/wiki/Sir_Flinders_Petrie \"Sir Flinders\nPetrie\") in the Descending Passage may have come from these now-vanished\ndoors.\n\n### King's Chamber\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/S10.08_Gizeh%2C_image_9620.jpg/220px-S10.08_Gizeh%2C_image_9620.jpg)](/wiki/File:S10.08_Gizeh,_image_9620.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:S10.08_Gizeh,_image_9620.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nSarcophagus in the King's chamber\n\nThe \"King's Chamber\"[2] is 20 cubits or 10.47 metres (34.4 ft) from east to\nwest and 10 cubits or 5.234 metres (17.17 ft) north to south. It has a flat\nroof 11 cubits and 5 digits or 5.852 metres (19 feet 2 inch) above the floor.\n0.91 m (3.0 ft) above the floor there are two narrow shafts in the north and\nsouth walls (one is now filled by an extractor fan in an attempt to circulate\nair inside the pyramid). The purpose of these shafts is not clear: they appear\nto be aligned towards stars or areas of the northern and southern skies, yet\none of them follows a [dog-leg course](/wiki/Dog-leg_\\(stairs\\) \"Dog-leg\n\\(stairs\\)\") through the masonry, indicating no intention to directly sight\nstars through them. They were long believed by Egyptologists to be \"air\nshafts\" for ventilation, but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour\nof the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of\nthe king’s spirit to the heavens.[35]\n\nThe King's Chamber is entirely faced with granite. Above the roof, which is\nformed of nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons, are five\ncompartments known as Relieving Chambers. The first four, like the King's\nChamber, have flat roofs formed by the floor of the chamber above, but the\nfinal chamber has a pointed roof. Vyse suspected the presence of upper\nchambers when he found that he could push a long reed through a crack in the\nceiling of the first chamber. From lower to upper, the chambers are known as\n\"[Davison](/wiki/Nathaniel_Davison \"Nathaniel Davison\")'s Chamber\",\n\"[Wellington](/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington \"Arthur\nWellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington\")'s Chamber\",\n\"[Nelson](/wiki/Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson \"Horatio Nelson, 1st\nViscount Nelson\")'s Chamber\", \"[Lady Arbuthnot](/wiki/Arbuthnot_baronets\n\"Arbuthnot baronets\")'s Chamber\", and\n\"[Campbell](/wiki/Patrick_Campbell_\\(1779%E2%80%931857\\) \"Patrick Campbell\n\\(1779–1857\\)\")'s Chamber\". It is believed that the compartments were intended\nto safeguard the King's Chamber from the possibility of a roof collapsing\nunder the weight of stone above the Chamber. As the chambers were not intended\nto be seen, they were not finished in any way and a few of the stones still\nretain masons' marks painted on them. One of the stones in Campbell's Chamber\nbears a mark, apparently the name of a work gang.[36][37]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Pyramid_of_Khufu_-\n_Entrance.jpg/220px-Pyramid_of_Khufu_-\n_Entrance.jpg)](/wiki/File:Pyramid_of_Khufu_-_Entrance.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Pyramid_of_Khufu_-_Entrance.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe entrance of the Pyramid\n\nThe only object in the King's Chamber is a rectangular granite\n_[sarcophagus](/wiki/Sarcophagus \"Sarcophagus\")_ , one corner of which is\nbroken. The sarcophagus is slightly larger than the Ascending Passage, which\nindicates that it must have been placed in the Chamber before the roof was put\nin place. Unlike the fine masonry of the walls of the Chamber, the sarcophagus\nis roughly finished, with saw marks visible in several places. This is in\ncontrast with the finely finished and decorated sarcophagi found in other\npyramids of the same period. [Petrie](/wiki/Flinders_Petrie \"Flinders Petrie\")\nsuggested that such a sarcophagus was intended but was lost in the river on\nthe way north from [Aswan](/wiki/Aswan \"Aswan\") and a hurriedly made\nreplacement was used instead.\n\n### Modern entrance\n\nToday tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, a tunnel\npurportedly created around AD 820 by Caliph [al-Ma'mun](/wiki/Al-Ma%27mun \"Al-\nMa'mun\")'s workmen using a battering ram.[38] The tunnel is cut straight\nthrough the masonry of the pyramid for approximately 27 metres (89 ft), then\nturns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage.\nIt is believed that their efforts dislodged the stone fitted in the ceiling of\nthe Descending Passage to hide the entrance to the Ascending Passage and it\nwas the noise of that stone falling and then sliding down the Descending\nPassage, which alerted them to the need to turn left. Unable to remove these\nstones, however, the workmen tunnelled up beside them through the softer\nlimestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage. It is\npossible to enter the Descending Passage from this point, but access is\nusually forbidden.[39]\n\n## Pyramid complex\n\nMain article: [Giza pyramid complex](/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex \"Giza pyramid\ncomplex\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Giza_pyramid_complex_%28map%29.svg/220px-\nGiza_pyramid_complex_%28map%29.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Giza_pyramid_complex_\\(map\\).svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Giza_pyramid_complex_\\(map\\).svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nMap of Giza pyramid complex – \"Pyramid of Khufu\" refers to the Great Pyramid.\n\nThe Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings including\nsmall pyramids. The Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the\npyramid and measured 52.2 metres (171 ft) north to south and 40 metres (130\nft) east to west, has almost entirely disappeared apart from the black basalt\npaving. There are only a few remnants of the causeway which linked the pyramid\nwith the valley and the Valley Temple. The Valley Temple is buried beneath the\nvillage of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found\nbut the site has not been excavated.[40][41] The basalt blocks show \"clear\nevidence\" of having been cut with some kind of saw with an estimated cutting\nblade of 15 feet (4.6 m) in length, capable of cutting at a rate of 1.5 inches\n(38 mm) per minute. [John Romer](/wiki/John_Romer_\\(Egyptologist\\) \"John Romer\n\\(Egyptologist\\)\") suggests that this \"super saw\" may have had copper teeth\nand weighed up to 300 pounds (140 kg). He theorizes that such a saw could have\nbeen attached to a wooden [trestle](/wiki/Trestle \"Trestle\") and possibly used\nin conjunction with vegetable oil, cutting sand, emery or pounded quartz to\ncut the blocks, which would have required the labour of at least a dozen men\nto operate it.[42]\n\nOn the south side are the subsidiary pyramids, popularly known as Queens'\nPyramids. Three remain standing to nearly full height but the fourth was so\nruined that its existence was not suspected until the recent discovery of the\nfirst course of stones and the remains of the capstone. Hidden beneath the\npaving around the pyramid was the tomb of [Queen Hetepheres\nI](/wiki/Hetepheres_I \"Hetepheres I\"), sister-wife of [Sneferu](/wiki/Sneferu\n\"Sneferu\") and mother of [Khufu](/wiki/Khufu \"Khufu\"). Discovered by accident\nby the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, though the carefully sealed\ncoffin proved to be empty.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Australian_11th_Battalion_group_photo.jpg/220px-\nAustralian_11th_Battalion_group_photo.jpg)](/wiki/File:Australian_11th_Battalion_group_photo.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Australian_11th_Battalion_group_photo.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGroup photo of [Australian 11th Battalion](/wiki/Australian_11th_Battalion\n\"Australian 11th Battalion\") soldiers on the Great Pyramid in 1915.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Spelterini_Pyramids.jpg/220px-\nSpelterini_Pyramids.jpg)](/wiki/File:Spelterini_Pyramids.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Spelterini_Pyramids.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Aerial photography](/wiki/Aerial_photography \"Aerial photography\"), taken\nfrom [Eduard Spelterini](/wiki/Eduard_Spelterini \"Eduard Spelterini\")'s\nballoon on 21 November 1904\n\nThe Giza pyramid complex, which includes among other structures the pyramids\nof Khufu, [Khafre](/wiki/Pyramid_of_Khafre \"Pyramid of Khafre\") and\n[Menkaure](/wiki/Pyramid_of_Menkaure \"Pyramid of Menkaure\"), is surrounded by\na [cyclopean](/wiki/Cyclopean_masonry \"Cyclopean masonry\") stone wall, the\nWall of the Crow. [Mark Lehner](/wiki/Mark_Lehner \"Mark Lehner\") has\ndiscovered a worker's town outside of the wall, otherwise known as \"The Lost\nCity\", dated by pottery styles, seal impressions, and\n[stratigraphy](/wiki/Stratigraphy \"Stratigraphy\") to have been constructed and\noccupied sometime during the reigns of Khafre (2520–2494 BC) and Menkaure\n(2490–2472 BC).[43][44] Recent discoveries by Mark Lehner and his team at the\ntown and nearby, including what appears to have been a thriving port, suggest\nthe town and associated living quarters consisting of barracks called\n\"galleries\" may not have been for the pyramid workers after all, but rather\nfor the soldiers and sailors who utilized the port. In light of this new\ndiscovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived Lehner now\nsuggests the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he\nbelieves were used to construct the pyramids or possibly at nearby\nquarries.[45]\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Australian archaeologist [Karl\nKromer](/w/index.php?title=Karl_Kromer&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Karl Kromer\n\\(page does not exist\\)\") excavated a mound in the South Field of the plateau.\nThis mound contained artefacts including mudbrick seals of Khufu, which he\nidentified with an artisans' settlement.[46] Mudbrick buildings just south of\nKhufu's Valley Temple contained mud sealings of Khufu and have been suggested\nto be a settlement serving the cult of Khufu after his death.[47] A worker's\ncemetery used at least between Khufu's reign and the end of the [Fifth\nDynasty](/wiki/Fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt \"Fifth Dynasty of Egypt\") was discovered\nsouth of the Wall of the Crow by [Zahi Hawass](/wiki/Zahi_Hawass \"Zahi\nHawass\") in 1990.[48]\n\n## Boats\n\nMain article: [Khufu ship](/wiki/Khufu_ship \"Khufu ship\")\n\nThere are three boat-shaped pits around the pyramid, of a size and shape to\nhave held complete boats, though so shallow that any superstructure, if there\never was one, must have been removed or disassembled. In May 1954, the\nEgyptian archaeologist [Kamal el-Mallakh](/wiki/Kamal_el-Mallakh \"Kamal el-\nMallakh\") discovered a fourth pit, a long, narrow rectangle, still covered\nwith slabs of stone weighing up to 15 tons. Inside were 1,224 pieces of wood,\nthe longest 23 metres (75 ft) long, the shortest 10 centimetres (0.33 ft).\nThese were entrusted to a boat builder, Haj Ahmed Yusuf, who worked out how\nthe pieces fit together. The entire process, including conservation and\nstraightening of the warped wood, took fourteen years.\n\nThe result is a cedar-wood boat 43.6 metres (143 ft) long, its timbers held\ntogether by ropes, which is currently housed in a special boat-shaped, air-\nconditioned museum beside the pyramid. During construction of this museum,\nwhich stands above the boat pit, a second sealed boat pit was discovered. It\nwas deliberately left unopened until 2011 when excavation began on the\nboat.[49]\n\n## Looting\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Comparison_of_pyramids.svg/langku-250px-\nComparison_of_pyramids.svg.png)](/w/index.php?title=File:Comparison_of_pyramids.svg&lang=ku)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Comparison_of_pyramids.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nComparison of approximate profiles of the Great Pyramid of Giza with some\nnotable pyramidal or near-pyramidal buildings.

However, as authors Briar and Hobbs claim, \"all\nthe pyramids were robbed\" by the [New Kingdom](/wiki/New_Kingdom \"New\nKingdom\"), when the construction of royal tombs in a desert valley, now known\nas the [Valley of the Kings](/wiki/Valley_of_the_Kings \"Valley of the Kings\"),\nbegan.[50][51] [Joyce Tyldesley](/wiki/Joyce_Tyldesley \"Joyce Tyldesley\")\nstates that the Great Pyramid itself \"is known to have been opened and emptied\nby the Middle Kingdom\", before the Arab [caliph](/wiki/Caliph \"Caliph\")\n[Abdullah al-Mamun](/wiki/Al-Ma%27mun \"Al-Ma'mun\") entered the pyramid around\nAD 820.[38]\n\n[I. E. S. Edwards](/wiki/I._E._S._Edwards \"I. E. S. Edwards\") discusses\n[Strabo](/wiki/Strabo \"Strabo\")'s mention that the pyramid \"a little way up\none side has a stone that may be taken out, which being raised up there is a\nsloping passage to the foundations\". Edwards suggested that the pyramid was\nentered by robbers after the end of the Old Kingdom and sealed and then\nreopened more than once until Strabo's door was added. He adds: \"If this\nhighly speculative surmise be correct, it is also necessary to assume either\nthat the existence of the door was forgotten or that the entrance was again\nblocked with facing stones\", in order to explain why al-Ma'mun could not find\nthe entrance.[52]\n\nHe also discusses a story told by [Herodotus](/wiki/Herodotus \"Herodotus\").\nHerodotus visited Egypt in the 5th century BC and recounts a story that he was\ntold concerning vaults under the pyramid built on an island where the body of\nCheops lies. Edwards notes that the pyramid had \"almost certainly been opened\nand its contents plundered long before the time of Herodotus\" and that it\nmight have been closed again during the [Twenty-sixth Dynasty of\nEgypt](/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Dynasty_of_Egypt \"Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt\")\nwhen other monuments were restored. He suggests that the story told to\nHerodotus could have been the result of almost two centuries of telling and\nretelling by Pyramid guides.[53]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Djedi Project](/wiki/Djedi_Project \"Djedi Project\")\n  * [Golden Ratio dimensions in Egyptian pyramids](/wiki/Golden_ratio#Egyptian_pyramids \"Golden ratio\")\n  * [Index of Egypt-related articles](/wiki/Index_of_Egypt-related_articles \"Index of Egypt-related articles\")\n  * [List of archaeoastronomical sites by country](/wiki/List_of_archaeoastronomical_sites_by_country \"List of archaeoastronomical sites by country\")\n  * [List of Egyptian pyramids](/wiki/List_of_Egyptian_pyramids \"List of Egyptian pyramids\")\n  * [List of largest monoliths in the world](/wiki/List_of_largest_monoliths_in_the_world \"List of largest monoliths in the world\") including a section on calculating the weight of megaliths\n  * [List of tallest freestanding structures](/wiki/List_of_tallest_freestanding_structures \"List of tallest freestanding structures\")\n  * [Pyramid inch](/wiki/Pyramid_inch \"Pyramid inch\")\n  * [Pyramidion](/wiki/Pyramidion \"Pyramidion\")\n  * [Pyramidology](/wiki/Pyramidology \"Pyramidology\")\n  * [The Upuaut Project](/wiki/The_Upuaut_Project \"The Upuaut Project\")\n\n## References\n\nNotes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiunu>.\n  2. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ \"By themselves, of course, none of these modern labels define the ancient purposes of the architecture they describe.\" —Romer (2007), p. 8\n  3. **Jump up ^** Shaw (2003), p. 89\n  4. **Jump up ^** Levy (2005), p. 17\n  5. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Petrie (1883)\n  6. **Jump up ^** [I.
