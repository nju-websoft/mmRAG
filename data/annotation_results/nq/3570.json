        "# Exploratory committee\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nIn the [election](/wiki/Election \"Election\") politics of the United States, an\n**exploratory committee** is an organization established to help determine\nwhether a potential candidate should run for an elected office. They are most\noften cited in reference to [United States\nPresidential](/wiki/United_States_President \"United States President\")\nhopefuls, prior to the [primaries](/wiki/United_States_presidential_primary\n\"United States presidential primary\").\n\nExploratory committees may be governed by law. For example, the [District of\nColumbia](/wiki/District_of_Columbia \"District of Columbia\") legally defines\n_Exploratory Committees_ as (in DC Official Code § 1-1101.01(6)(B)(vi)):\n\n> Exploratory, draft or \"testing the waters\" committees are formed solely for\n> the purpose of determining the feasibility of an individual’s candidacy for\n> office. The activities of exploratory committees may include polling,\n> travel, and telephone calls to determine whether the individual should\n> become a candidate.\n\n[Ron Elving](/wiki/Ron_Elving \"Ron Elving\") described the use of exploratory\ncommittees in his article, _Declaring for President is a[Dance of Seven\nVeils](/wiki/Dance_of_the_seven_veils \"Dance of the seven veils\")_, which\naired on [National Public Radio](/wiki/National_Public_Radio \"National Public\nRadio\") on December 5, 2006. He wrote:\n\n> The exploratory committee has been around for decades, and technically it\n> creates a legal shell for a candidate who expects to spend more than $5,000\n> while contemplating an actual run. Under the rules, exploratory money may be\n> raised without the full disclosure of sources required of true candidates.\n> Only when the candidate drops the exploratory label does the full\n> responsibility of transparency apply.\n>\n> Candidates use an exploratory committee as not only a transitional phase for\n> their bookkeeping but as an extra claim on media attention. Some of the most\n> skillful handlers like to leak word that their candidate is testing the\n> waters, then leak word that he or she is thinking about forming an\n> exploratory committee. Additional \"news\" can be made when the same candidate\n> actually forms such a committee and registers with the Federal Election\n> Commission. Yet a fourth round of attention may be generated when the word\n> exploratory gets dropped from the committee filing.[1]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Exploratory_committee&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [NPR: Declaring for President is a Dance of Seven Veils](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6581302)\n\n## External\nlinks[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Exploratory_committee&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: External links\")]\n\n  * [Testing the Waters and Campaign Committees](http://www.fec.gov/press/bkgnd/pres_cf/exploratory.html) (Press Release) _Federal Election Commission_ (no date)\n  * [Candidate Registration Brochure](http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/candidate_registration_brochure.pdf) _Federal Election Commission,_ March 2005, revised June 2008.\n  * [District of Columbia Campaign Finance Guide](http://ocf.dc.gov/cfg/cfg_sec6.shtm)\n\n  \n\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png) | _This article related to the[politics of the United States](/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States \"Politics of the United States\") is a [stub](/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub \"Wikipedia:Stub\").
