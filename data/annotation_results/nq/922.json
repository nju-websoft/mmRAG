With the\nincrease in technological and global advancement, the size of the White House\nstaff has increased to include an array of policy experts to effectively\naddress various fields of the modern day.\n\nThe Executive Office is overseen by the [White House Chief of\nStaff](/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff \"White House Chief of Staff\").[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Organization\n    * 2.1 White House Offices\n  * 3 Budget history\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n  * 6 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nIn 1939, during [Franklin D. Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin\nD. Roosevelt\")'s second term in office, the foundations of the modern [White\nHouse](/wiki/White_House \"White House\") staff were created. Based on the\nrecommendations of a presidentially commissioned panel of [political\nscience](/wiki/Political_science \"Political science\") and [public\nadministration](/wiki/Public_administration \"Public administration\") experts\nthat was known as the [Brownlow Committee](/wiki/Brownlow_Committee \"Brownlow\nCommittee\"), Roosevelt was able to get Congress to approve the [Reorganization\nAct of 1939](/wiki/Reorganization_Act_of_1939 \"Reorganization Act of 1939\").\nThe Act led to Reorganization Plan No. 1,[2] which created the EOP,[3] which\nreported directly to the president. The EOP encompassed two subunits at its\noutset: the [White House Office](/wiki/White_House_Office \"White House\nOffice\") (WHO) and the Bureau of the Budget, the predecessor to today's\n[Office of Management and Budget](/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget\n\"Office of Management and Budget\"), which had been created in 1921 and\noriginally located in the [Treasury\nDepartment](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury \"United States\nDepartment of the Treasury\"). It absorbed most of the functions of the\nNational Emergency Council.[4] Initially, the new staff system appeared more\nambitious on paper than in practice; the increase in the size of the staff was\nquite modest at the start. But it laid the groundwork for the large and\norganizationally complex White House staff that would emerge during the\npresidencies of Roosevelt's successors.[5]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Exec_bldg.JPG/270px-\nExec_bldg.JPG)](/wiki/File:Exec_bldg.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Exec_bldg.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Eisenhower Executive Office\nBuilding](/wiki/Eisenhower_Executive_Office_Building \"Eisenhower Executive\nOffice Building\") at night.\n\nRoosevelt's efforts are also notable in contrast to those of his predecessors\nin office. During the nineteenth century, presidents had few staff resources.\n[Thomas Jefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") had one\nmessenger and one secretary at his disposal, both of whose salaries were paid\nby the president personally. It was not until 1857 that Congress appropriated\nmoney ($2,500) for the hiring of one clerk. By [Ulysses S.\nGrant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S. Grant\")'s presidency (1869–1877),\nthe staff had grown to three. By 1900, the White House staff included one\n\"secretary to the president\" (then the title of the president's chief aide),\ntwo assistant secretaries, two executive clerks, a\n[stenographer](/wiki/Stenography \"Stenography\"), and seven other office\npersonnel. Under [Warren G. Harding](/wiki/Warren_G._Harding \"Warren G.\nHarding\"), the size of the staff expanded to thirty-one, although most were\nclerical positions. During [Herbert Hoover](/wiki/Herbert_Hoover \"Herbert\nHoover\")'s presidency, two additional secretaries to the president were added\nby Congress, one of whom Hoover designated as his [Press\nSecretary](/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary \"White House Press Secretary\").\nFrom 1933 to 1939, even as he greatly expanded the scope of the federal\ngovernment's policies and powers in response to the [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\"), Roosevelt muddled\nthrough: his \"brains trust\" of top advisers were often appointed to vacant\npositions in agencies and departments, whence they drew their salaries since\nthe White House lacked statutory or budgetary authority to create new staff\npositions. Ballpark estimates indicate some 2,000 to 2,500 persons serve in\nEOP staff positions with policy-making responsibilities, with a budget of $300\nto $400 million (George W. Bush's budget request for Fiscal Year 2005 was for\n$341 million in support of 1,850 personnel).[6]\n\n##\nOrganization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Organization\")]\n\nSenior staff within the Executive Office of the President have the title\nAssistant to the President, second-level staff have the title Deputy Assistant\nto the President, and third-level staff have the title Special Assistant to\nthe President.\n\nThe core White House staff appointments, and most EOP officials generally, are\nnot required to be [confirmed](/wiki/Advice_and_consent \"Advice and consent\")\nby the [U.S. Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate \"United States Senate\"),\nalthough there are a handful of exceptions (e.g., the Director of the [Office\nof Management and Budget](/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget \"Office of\nManagement and Budget\"), the Chair and members of the [Council of Economic\nAdvisers](/wiki/Council_of_Economic_Advisers \"Council of Economic Advisers\"),\nand the [United States Trade\nRepresentative](/wiki/United_States_Trade_Representative \"United States Trade\nRepresentative\")).\n\nThe information in the following table is current as of July 31, 2017.
