        "# Cancer survivor\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nA **cancer survivor** is a person with [cancer](/wiki/Cancer \"Cancer\") of any\ntype who is still living. Whether a person becomes a survivor at the time of\ndiagnosis or after completing treatment, whether people who are actively dying\nare considered survivors, and whether healthy friends and family members of\nthe cancer patient are also considered survivors, varies from group to group.\nSome people who have been diagnosed with cancer reject the term _survivor_ or\ndisagree with some definitions of it.\n\nHow many people are cancer survivors depends on the definition used. Currently\nnearly 65% of adults diagnosed with cancer in the developed world are expected\nto live at least five years after the cancer is discovered.[1] In the U.S. for\nexample, about 11 million Americans alive today—one in 30 people–are either\ncurrently undergoing treatment for cancer or have done so in the past.[2]\n\nMany cancer survivors describe the process of living with and beating cancer\nas a life-changing experience.[3] It is not uncommon for survivors to use the\nexperience as opportunities for creative self-transformation into a \"better\nperson\" or as motivation to meet goals of great personal importance, such as\nclimbing a mountain or reconciling with an estranged family member. This\nprocess of posttraumatic growth is called _[benefit\nfinding](/wiki/Benefit_finding \"Benefit finding\")_.[4] Cancer survivors often\nhave specific medical and non-medical needs related to their cancer\nexperience.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Definitions and alternatives\n  * 2 Needs of cancer survivors\n    * 2.1 Psychosocial\n      * 2.1.1 Returning to Life\n      * 2.1.2 Ongoing effects\n      * 2.1.3 Fear of cancer recurrence\n      * 2.1.4 Survivorship\n    * 2.2 Physical\n  * 3 Adolescent and young adult survivors\n    * 3.1 Barriers to quality long-term follow-up care\n    * 3.2 Impact of Affordable Care Act on the AYA survivor population\n  * 4 Care\n  * 5 Family members\n  * 6 Notable cancer survivors\n  * 7 See also\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 External links\n\n## Definitions and\nalternatives[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Definitions and alternatives\")]\n\n[Macmillan Cancer Support](/wiki/Macmillan_Cancer_Support \"Macmillan Cancer\nSupport\") in the UK defines a cancer survivor as someone who is \"living with\nor beyond cancer\", namely someone who:\n\n  * has completed initial cancer management and has no apparent evidence of active disease;\n  * is living with progressive disease and may be receiving cancer treatment, but is not in the terminal phases of illness; or\n  * has had cancer in the past.[5]\n\nThe [National Coalition for Cancer\nSurvivorship](/wiki/National_Coalition_for_Cancer_Survivorship \"National\nCoalition for Cancer Survivorship\") (NCCS) pioneered the definition of\nsurvivor as being any person diagnosed with cancer, from the time of initial\ndiagnosis until his or her death. This expansive definition of \"survivor\"\nincludes people who are dying from untreatable cancer. NCCS later expanded the\ndefinition of survivor even further to include family, friends and [voluntary\ncaregivers](/wiki/Voluntary_caregiver \"Voluntary caregiver\") who are affected\nby the diagnosis in any way.[6] The US [National Cancer\nInstitute](/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute \"National Cancer Institute\")'s\nOffice of Cancer Survivorship uses a variant of this expanded definition.[6]\n\nThe word _survivor_ is a [loaded term](/wiki/Loaded_language \"Loaded\nlanguage\").[3] Within the [breast cancer culture](/wiki/Breast_cancer_culture\n\"Breast cancer culture\"), survivorship is conferred upon women (and men) who\nare perceived as having suffered emotional or physical trauma, even if their\n[breast cancer](/wiki/Breast_cancer \"Breast cancer\") was a non-life-\nthreatening pre-cancerous condition like [LCIS](/wiki/LCIS \"LCIS\") or\n[DCIS](/wiki/Ductal_carcinoma_in_situ \"Ductal carcinoma in situ\"). The term\ntends to erase and degrade people who are dying of incurable cancer. This idea\nof survivorship emphasizes and values longevity of life after diagnosis, while\noverlooking issues of [quality of life](/wiki/Quality_of_life \"Quality of\nlife\").[3]\n\nSome people reject the term _survivor_ as being a narrow conceptualization of\nhighly variable human experiences. Alternatives include **alivers** and\n**thrivers** , which put emphasis on living as well as possible, despite\nlimitations and disability.[3] A third term, the **diers** , is used by some\nterminally ill patients who reject the claim that dying is part of\nsurvivorship or should be covered up with inappropriately optimistic\nlanguage.[3]\n\nThe term **previvor** has been used to describe [unaffected\ncarriers](/wiki/Genetic_carrier \"Genetic carrier\"). Unaffected carriers, or\nprevivors, are those who have not diagnosed with [cancer](/wiki/Cancer\n\"Cancer\"), but who know that they are likely to develop cancer due to certain\n[genetic mutations](/wiki/Genetic_mutation \"Genetic mutation\") that form a\nknown [cancer syndrome](/wiki/Cancer_syndrome \"Cancer syndrome\"). They have a\nsur**vived** the **pre** disposition, or higher risk, of cancer.[7][8] As\nsuch, this is the first generation in human history who, armed with\ninformation about a predisposition to a cancer after opting into\n[DNA](/wiki/DNA \"DNA\") testing, can make informed choices prior to cancer\ndiagnosis. The typical previvor has tested positive for a [BRCA\nmutation](/wiki/BRCA_mutation \"BRCA mutation\") and learned that she is at high\nrisk for developing [breast cancer](/wiki/Breast_cancer \"Breast cancer\") and\n[ovarian cancer](/wiki/Ovarian_cancer \"Ovarian cancer\"), and is attempting to\nmanage that risk through a combination of increased surveillance through\nmammograms, breast MRIs, [pelvic ultrasounds](/wiki/Pelvic_ultrasound \"Pelvic\nultrasound\"), [oophorectomy](/wiki/Oophorectomy \"Oophorectomy\"), [bilateral\nmastectomy](/wiki/Bilateral_mastectomy \"Bilateral mastectomy\"), and other\nmedical procedures. There has been much controversy over the term _previvor_ ,\ndue to the fact that the name compares these healthy women to people have\nactually been diagnosed with invasive cancer.\n\n## Needs of cancer\nsurvivors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Needs of cancer survivors\")]\n\nPeople who have finished cancer treatment often have psychological and\nphysical medical challenges.[9] These effects can vary from person to person,\nchange over time, and range in intensity from mild and intermittent to fully\n[disabling](/wiki/Disabling \"Disabling\"). They commonly include\n[fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_\\(medical\\) \"Fatigue \\(medical\\)\"),[10]\n[pain](/wiki/Pain \"Pain\"),[11] [sleep problems](/wiki/Sleep_problems \"Sleep\nproblems\"),[12] physical side effects like [lymphoedema](/wiki/Lymphoedema\n\"Lymphoedema\"),[13] weight gain,[14] anxiety and depression,[15] fear of\ncancer recurrence,[16] and impaired [quality of life](/wiki/Quality_of_life\n\"Quality of life\").[17]\n\n###\nPsychosocial[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Psychosocial\")]\n\n#### Returning to\nLife[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Returning to Life\")]\n\nIf the treatment is lengthy and disruptive, many patients experience some\ndifficulty in returning to normal daily life.[18] The energy needed to cope\nwith a rigorous treatment program may have caused them to disconnect from\nprevious daily patterns, such as working, normal self-care, and housekeeping.\nA small number of patients become dependent on the attention and sympathy that\nthey received during their treatment and feel neglected when life returns to\nnormal. There are tremendous implications that cancer has on the relationships\nthat survivors have with their loved ones (particularly their partners) once\ntheir cancer has been treated,[19] and social support plays a critical role in\ntheir long-term emotional adjustment.[20]\n\n#### Ongoing\neffects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Ongoing effects\")]\n\nSome survivors, even if the cancer has been permanently cured, struggle\nemotionally from the trauma of having experienced a life-threatening\ndisease.[21] Cancer survivors suffer from more psychological distress than\nthose who have never experienced cancer (5.6% compared to 3.0%)[22] Serious\npsychosocial distress was seen 40% more among cancer survivors of five years\nor more than in those who have never had cancer.[22] About 10% develop [major\ndepressive disorder](/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder \"Major depressive\ndisorder\"); others experience an [adjustment\ndisorder](/wiki/Adjustment_disorder \"Adjustment disorder\").[21] In young adult\ncancer survivors, one small study found that 20% of participants met the full\nclinical diagnosis of [post-traumatic stress disorder](/wiki/Post-\ntraumatic_stress_disorder \"Post-traumatic stress disorder\") (PTSD), and 45% to\n95% displayed at least one symptom of PTSD.[23] Survivors of adult cancer are\nat an increased risk of [suicidal ideology](/wiki/Suicidal_ideology \"Suicidal\nideology\") (having thoughts about suicide),[24] while as many as 13% of\nchildhood cancer survivors experience suicidal ideology.[25] Issues of pain\nand physical ailments have been hypothesized as major contributing factors in\ncancer survivors experiencing this suicidal ideology.\n\n#### Fear of cancer\nrecurrence[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Fear of cancer recurrence\")]\n\nPatients whose cancer is in remission may still have to cope with the\nuncertainty that at any time their cancer could return without warning. After\nthe initial treatment has ended, [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety \"Anxiety\") is more\ncommon among cancer survivors than among other people.[26] This anxiety\nregarding the cancer's return is referred to as fear of cancer recurrence.[27]\nMany patients are anxious that any minor [symptom](/wiki/Symptom \"Symptom\")\nindicates that the cancer has returned, with as many as 9 in 10 patients\nfearful that their cancer will recur or spread.[2] In addition to the\nappearance of any new aches and pains, common triggers for a fear that the\ncancer may return include hearing that someone else has been diagnosed with\ncancer, annual medical exams to determine whether the cancer recurred and news\nstories about cancer.[28] This anxiety leads to more medical check ups, which\ncan be measured even after a period of up to ten years.[29] This fear can have\na significant impact on individual's lives, resulting in difficulties in their\ndaily life such as work and socialising, and difficulties planning for the\nfuture.[30] Overall, fear of cancer recurrence is related to a reduced quality\nof life in cancer survivors[30]\n\nWhile Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR) can be adaptive at low levels, high\nlevels of FCR require psychological treatment. At present, there are no\npsychometrically sound measures of FCR, which makes research into the\neffectiveness of treatment protocols difficult to interpret.[31] Treatments\nthat are being investigated include: [cognitive-behavioural\ntherapy](/wiki/Cognitive-behavioural_therapy \"Cognitive-behavioural\ntherapy\"),[32] Meta-cognitive therapy[33] and Cognitive-existential group\ntherapy[34] and exercise.[35]\n\n####\nSurvivorship[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Survivorship\")]\n\nThe cultural ideal of a survivor may add to individual patients' distress if\nthe patient is unable or unwilling to live up to the ideal.[3] The ideal\nsurvivor is bravely committed to mainstream medicine and optimistic or even\ncertain of a physical cure. He or she is open about diagnosis and treatment\nand becomes an educated, empowered [medical\nconsumer](/w/index.php?title=Medical_consumerism&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Medical consumerism \\(page does not exist\\)\"). The ideal survivor, like a\n[superwoman](/wiki/Superwoman_\\(sociology\\) \"Superwoman \\(sociology\\)\") who\nsimultaneously manages her home, family, and career, struggles valiantly to\nprevent cancer from affecting loved ones by appearing, behaving, and working\nas much as possible. Once the immediate crisis is past, the person may feel\nstrongly pressured to donate time, money, and energy to cancer-related\norganizations. Above all, the ideal survivor does not die of cancer. People\nwho publicly conform to this ideal are given social status and respect.[3]\n\n### Physical[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Physical\")]\n\nIn terms of medical challenges, some survivors experience [cancer-related\nfatigue](/wiki/Cancer-related_fatigue \"Cancer-related fatigue\"), may have\nlong-term side effects from cancer and its treatment, and may need extensive\nrehabilitation for mobility and function if aggressive surgery was required to\nremove the cancer. They may experience temporary or persistent [post-\nchemotherapy cognitive impairment](/wiki/Post-\nchemotherapy_cognitive_impairment \"Post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment\").\nSome young survivors [lose their ability to have children](/wiki/Infertility\n\"Infertility\").\n\nCancer survivors frequently need medical monitoring, and some treatments for\nunrelated diseases in the future may be contraindicated. For example, a\npatient who has had a significant amount of [radiation\ntherapy](/wiki/Radiation_therapy \"Radiation therapy\") may not be a good\ncandidate for more radiation treatments in the future. To assist with these\nneeds, \"survivor care plans\" have been promoted. These are personalized\ndocuments that describe the person's diagnosis and treatment in detail, list\ncommon known side effects, and specifically outline the steps that the\nsurvivor should take in the future, ranging from maintaining a healthy weight\nto receiving specific medical tests on a stated schedule.[36]\n\nMedical tests to determine whether the cancer has returned commonly provoke\nfears. Informally, this is called _scanxiety_ , a portmanteau of _scan_ and\n_anxiety_. A desire to avoid feeling this fear can prompt survivors to\npostpone or refuse tests.[37][38]\n\nSurvivors of childhood cancer have a [life expectancy](/wiki/Life_expectancy\n\"Life expectancy\") up to 28% shorter than people in the general\npopulation.[39] Therefore, there is a need to closely monitor these patients\nfor much longer than usual. The [Children's Oncology\nGroup](/wiki/Children%27s_Oncology_Group \"Children's Oncology Group\")\nrecommends that monitoring should include periodic follow up and screening by\na clinician familiar with these patients' risks. Improving these patients'\n[longevity](/wiki/Longevity \"Longevity\") requires recognition and treatment of\nillnesses associated with late effects in the decades after therapy for\nchildhood cancer. For example, survivors of childhood cancer may have more\ndifficulty than typical with [breastfeeding](/wiki/Breastfeeding\n\"Breastfeeding\") and require more support to undertake this health-promoting\nactivity.[40] Others experience various forms of heart disease. One challenge\nto achieving this goal is that childhood cancer survivors are both very\nadaptable and accustomed to denying difficulties; as a result, they tend to\nminimize their [symptoms](/wiki/Symptoms \"Symptoms\"). Therefore,\n[internists](/wiki/Internists \"Internists\") may not give them all the\nattention they need and thus the actual help they may need. Symptom\nmanagement, health promotion, specific attention to psychosocial needs, and\nsurveillance for recurrence and specific late effects of treatment are\nhelpful.[39]\n\n## Adolescent and young adult\nsurvivors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Adolescent and young adult survivors\")]\n\nAdolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors, often defined as being between the\nages of 15 and 39, have seen advancements in technology and modern medicine\ncausing a dramatic increase in the number of AYA survivors. Prior to 1970,\nbeing diagnosed with cancer during childhood was considered a universally\nfatal disease. From 1995 to 2000, however, the 5-year survival rate for\nchildren diagnosed with cancer was 80%.[41] Significant progress has been\nbuilt in the last 25 years as there are now approximately 270,000 survivors of\npediatric cancer in the U.S., which translates to approximately 1 in every 640\nyoung adults being a survivor of childhood cancer.[42][43] However, as studies\nhave shown, as patient needs increase, the likelihood of having an unmet need\nalso increases.[44] For the AYA population, 2 out of 3 childhood cancer\nsurvivors will develop 1 complication due to the therapy they received and 1\nout of 3 will develop serious or life-threatening complications, meaning they\nwill most likely need treatment and follow-up care.[45] In addition, AYAs may\nexperience greater difficulties adhering to treatment, which may negatively\nimpact future outcomes.[46]\n\nAn AYA survivor faces a variety of issues as a result of their cancer\ndiagnosis and treatment that are unique to their particular age group which\ndifferentiate their survivor population from the adult survivor population.\nFor example, AYA survivors report that their education, employment, sexual\nfunctioning,[47] marriage, fertility, and other life values are impacted by\ntheir cancer.[48][49] Data show that AYA survivors have a much greater risk of\ngetting a second primary malignancy as a side effect of the treatment for\ntheir original diagnosis. It is believed that AYAs have a much higher relative\nrisk of developing a second primary cancer because the intensity of the\ntreatment for their original diagnosis, typically including any combination of\nchemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, is much higher than the level of\nintensity given to patients over 40.[50] Furthermore, since AYA survivors are\ndiagnosed and treated at such a young age, their length of time as a survivor\nis much longer than their adult counterparts, making it more likely they will\nface a second primary cancer in their lifetime.[50]\n\n### Barriers to quality long-term follow-up\ncare[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Barriers to quality long-term follow-up care\")]\n\nChildhood cancer survivors, in particular, need comprehensive long-term\nfollow-up care to thrive. One way this can be accomplished is through\ncontinuous follow-up care with a primary care physician who is trained to\nidentify possible late effects from previous treatments and therapies.[51]\n\nThe [Children's Oncology Group](/wiki/Children%27s_Oncology_Group \"Children's\nOncology Group\") (COG) has designed a set of survivorship guidelines that hope\nto aid both health care professionals and survivors themselves, in both the\nintricacies and basics of long-term follow-up care. The COG has guidelines for\nhow a patient should put together their own “treatment summary”, so they can\nhave their treatment history with them when they visit any health care\nprovider. The COG suggests that a survivor include the following in his/her\ntreatment summary:\n\n  * Name of disease, date of diagnosis, stage of disease, contact information of the clinics/hospitals where you received your care\n  * Names and doses of the chemotherapy and radiation you have received and the area of the body that was radiated\n  * Names and dates of any surgeries you have had\n  * If you have received a transplant, the type of transplant and where it was received and whether you developed any chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease\n  * Names and dates of any significant complications and treatment received for those complications[52]\n\nWith the treatment summary, experts hope that survivors will be better\nequipped to face the significant burden of maintaining quality follow-up care\nlong after their original treatment. This is especially important for the AYA\npopulation, in particular, because they are typically facing major social\nchanges regarding their relationship status, employment or education status,\ntheir insurance coverage, and even their place of residence, etc. Typically,\nmost of these factors are pretty constant for the adult population and if they\nexperience any changes, it would occur in one or two aspects of their life.\nHowever, with the AYA population, the period of time until they are 40 is when\nthey are going to, for the majority of the population, undergo the most\nchange. This reality underscores the importance of a smooth transition from\nchild-centered to adult-focused health care services through which they are\nconsistently managed.[53]\n\n### Impact of Affordable Care Act on the AYA survivor\npopulation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Impact of Affordable Care Act on the AYA survivor population\")]\n\nThe US [Affordable Care Act](/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act \"Affordable Care Act\")\n(ACA) in 2010 makes it illegal for health insurance providers to deny coverage\nfor a [pre-existing condition](/wiki/Pre-existing_condition \"Pre-existing\ncondition\"), such as previously having survived cancer.[54] Young adults will\nnow be required to have insurance coverage and, with a few exceptions, will be\nable to be covered under their parent's coverage until the age of 26 as a\ndependent in their parent's plan.[54]\n\n## Care[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Care\")]\n\nStudies among endometrial cancer survivors show that satisfaction with\ninformation provided about the disease and treatment increases the quality of\nlife, lowers depression and results in less anxiety.[55] People who receive\ninformation on paper, compared to oral, indicate that they receive more\ninformation and are more satisfied about the information provided.[56] The\nAmerican Institute of Medicine and the [Dutch Health\nCouncil](/wiki/Dutch_Health_Council \"Dutch Health Council\") recommend the use\nof a Survivorship Care Plan; which is a summary of a patient's course of\ntreatment, with recommendations for subsequent surveillance, management of\nlate effects, and strategies for health promotion.[57]\n\nCancer survivors are encouraged to meet the same guidelines for physical\nactivity as the rest of the population.[58][59] Increased physical activity\nreduces both all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in breast[60] and colo-\nrectal cancer survivors.[61] Physical activity improves quality of life among\na range of cancer survivors[62] and may also assist with cancer-related\nfatigue and common co-morbidities.[63][64]\n\nDiet can also impact long-term mortality, with evidence across various cancer\ntypes.[65][66][67][68]\n\nHowever, adherence to diet and exercise recommendations among cancer survivors\nis often poor.[69][70][71] Digital [behaviour\nchange](/wiki/Behavior_change_\\(individual\\) \"Behavior change \\(individual\\)\")\ninterventions can be successful at increasing physical activity and may also\nhelp with diet in cancer survivors.[72]\n\n## Family\nmembers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit\nsection: Family members\")]\n\nFamily members can be significantly affected by the cancer experience of their\nloved ones.[73][74] For parents of children with cancer, finishing treatment\ncan be a particularly vulnerable time. In the post-treatment period, some\nparents may experience increases in anxiety, depression and feelings of\nhelplessness.[75] Evidence-based psychological interventions tailored to the\nneeds of parents of childhood cancer survivors may assist parents in resuming\ntheir normal lives after their child has finished treatment.[76]\n\nSpouses of cancer survivors are more likely than other people to experience\nanxiety in the years after their partner's successful treatment.[26]\n\n## Notable cancer\nsurvivors[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Notable cancer survivors\")]\n\n    _See[Category:Cancer survivors](/wiki/Category:Cancer_survivors \"Category:Cancer survivors\")_\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Learning problems in childhood cancer](/wiki/Learning_problems_in_childhood_cancer \"Learning problems in childhood cancer\")\n  * [Psycho-oncology](/wiki/Psycho-oncology \"Psycho-oncology\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Cancer_survivor&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Hart, Jane (August 2007).
