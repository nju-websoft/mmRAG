For the English law, see [Bill of Rights\n1689](/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689 \"Bill of Rights 1689\"). For the United States\nconstitutional amendments, see [United States Bill of\nRights](/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights \"United States Bill of Rights\").\n\n\"Charter of rights\" redirects here.

The purpose is to protect those rights\nagainst [infringement from public officials and private\ncitizens](/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights \"Civil and political rights\"). The\nterm \"bill of rights\" originates from [England](/wiki/England \"England\"),\nwhere it refers to the [Bill of Rights 1689](/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689 \"Bill\nof Rights 1689\") enacted by Parliament following the [Glorious\nRevolution](/wiki/Glorious_Revolution \"Glorious Revolution\"), asserting the\nsupremacy of Parliament over the monarch, and listing a number of fundamental\nrights and liberties.\n\nBills of rights may be _[entrenched](/wiki/Entrenched_clause \"Entrenched\nclause\")_ or _unentrenched_. An entrenched bill of rights cannot be modified\nor repealed by a country's legislature through normal procedure, instead\nrequiring a supermajority or referendum; often it is part of a country's\nconstitution and therefore subject to special procedures applicable to\nconstitutional amendments. A _not entrenched_ bill of rights is a normal\n[statute law](/wiki/Statute_law \"Statute law\") and as such can be modified or\nrepealed by the legislature at will.\n\nIn practice, not every jurisdiction enforces the protection of the rights\narticulated in its bill of rights.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 List of bills of rights\n    * 1.1 General\n    * 1.2 Specifically targeted documents\n  * 2 Exceptions in Western democracies\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n\n## List of bills of\nrights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bill_of_rights&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: List of bills of rights\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/English_Bill_of_Rights_of_1689.jpg/220px-\nEnglish_Bill_of_Rights_of_1689.jpg)](/wiki/File:English_Bill_of_Rights_of_1689.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:English_Bill_of_Rights_of_1689.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Bill of Rights 1689](/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689 \"Bill of Rights 1689\") is\nan Act of the [Parliament of England](/wiki/Parliament_of_England \"Parliament\nof England\") asserting certain rights\n\n### General[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bill_of_rights&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: General\")]\n\n  * [Magna Carta](/wiki/Magna_Carta \"Magna Carta\") (1215;
