Initially a track of Melanie's\nalbum _[Gather Me](/wiki/Gather_Me \"Gather Me\")_ , produced by Melanie's\nhusband, Peter Schekeryk, it was known also as \"The Rollerskate Song\" due to\nits chorus. It was her greatest success, scoring No. 1 on the [_Billboard_ Hot\n100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") singles chart during\nDecember 1971 and January 1972. [Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_charts \"Billboard\ncharts\") ranked it as the [No. 9 song of 1972](/wiki/Billboard_Year-\nEnd_Hot_100_singles_of_1972 \"Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1972\"). It\nalso scored No. 1 in [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") and\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") and No. 4 on the [UK Singles\nChart](/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart \"UK Singles Chart\"). The song was featured in\nthe 1997 movie _[Boogie Nights](/wiki/Boogie_Nights \"Boogie Nights\")_ as well\nas the 2010 movie _[Jackass 3D](/wiki/Jackass_3D \"Jackass 3D\")_ and an episode\nof _[Helix](/wiki/Helix_\\(TV_series\\) \"Helix \\(TV series\\)\")_.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Overview\n  * 2 Controversy\n  * 3 Chart performance\n    * 3.1 Weekly charts\n    * 3.2 Year-end charts\n  * 4 Selected list of recorded versions\n  * 5 Parodies and other versions\n  * 6 References in popular culture\n  * 7 References\n\n## Overview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Brand_New_Key&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Overview\")]\n\nThe song is sung from the viewpoint of a girl with [roller\nskates](/wiki/Roller_skates \"Roller skates\") trying to attract the attention\nof a boy.\n\nIn an interview with [Examiner.com](/wiki/Examiner.com \"Examiner.com\"),\nMelanie described what she claimed was the inspiration for the song: \"I was\nfasting with a 27-day fast on water. I broke the fast and went back to my life\nliving in [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey \"New Jersey\") and we were going to a\n[flea market](/wiki/Flea_market \"Flea market\") around six in the morning. On\nthe way back… and I had just broken the fast, from the flea market, we passed\na [McDonald's](/wiki/McDonald%27s \"McDonald's\") and the aroma hit me, and I\nhad been a vegetarian before the fast. So we pulled into the McDonald's and I\ngot the whole works... the burger, the shake, and the fries… and no sooner\nafter I finished that last bite of my burger… that song was in my head. The\naroma brought back memories of roller skating and learning to ride a bike and\nthe vision of my dad holding the back fender of the tire. And me saying to my\ndad... 'You’re holding, you’re holding, you’re holding, right?' Then I’d look\nback and he wasn’t holding and I’d fall. So that whole thing came back to me\nand came out in this song.\"[1]\n\n## Controversy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Brand_New_Key&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Controversy\")]\n\nMany listeners[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] detect sexual [innuendo](/wiki/Innuendo\n\"Innuendo\") in the lyrics, with the key in its lock thought to symbolize\n[sexual intercourse](/wiki/Sexual_intercourse \"Sexual intercourse\"), or in\nphrases such as \"I go pretty far\" and \"I've been all around the world\".\nAnother common viewpoint on the song, is that the song is clearly an innocent\nreflection upon the typical workings of a child's mind regarding their\npossessions (In this case, quad skates and the associated key essential for\ntightening/loosening a locking clamp on the skates).\n\nMelanie has acknowledged the possibility of detecting sexual innuendo in the\nsong, without confirming or denying the intent:\n\n> [The song], \"Brand New Key\", I wrote in about fifteen minutes one night. I\n> thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties tune. I guess a key and a lock\n> have always been [Freudian](/wiki/Sigmund_Freud \"Sigmund Freud\") symbols,\n> and pretty obvious ones at that. There was no deep serious expression behind\n> the song, but people read things into it. They made up incredible stories as\n> to what the lyrics said and what the song meant. In some places, it was even\n> banned from the radio.\n>\n> My idea about songs is that once you write them, you have very little say in\n> their life afterward. It's a lot like having a baby. You conceive a song,\n> deliver it, and then give it as good a start as you can. After that, it's on\n> its own. People will take it any way they want to take it.[2]\n\n## Chart\nperformance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Brand_New_Key&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Chart performance\")]\n\n### Weekly\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Brand_New_Key&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Weekly charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1971–72) | Peak  \nposition  \n---|---  \nAustralia ([Kent Music Report](/wiki/Kent_Music_Report \"Kent Music Report\"))[3] | 1  \nCanada ([_RPM_](/wiki/RPM_\\(magazine\\) \"RPM \\(magazine\\)\"))[4] | 1  \nNew Zealand (_[Listener](/wiki/New_Zealand_Listener \"New Zealand Listener\")_)[5] | 1  \nUK Singles Chart[6] | 4  \nUS _[Billboard](/wiki/Billboard_\\(magazine\\) \"Billboard \\(magazine\\)\")_ [Hot 100](/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 \"Billboard Hot 100\") | 1  \nUS _Billboard_ [Adult Contemporary](/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_\\(chart\\) \"Adult Contemporary \\(chart\\)\")[7] | 5  \nUS _[Cash Box](/wiki/Cashbox_\\(magazine\\) \"Cashbox \\(magazine\\)\")_ Top 100 [8] | 1  \n  \n### Year-end\ncharts[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Brand_New_Key&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Year-end charts\")]\n\n| Chart (1972) | Rank  \n---|---  \nAustralia [3] | 11  \nCanada [9] | 27  \nUK [10] | 46  \nU.S. _Billboard_ Hot 100 [11] | 9  \nU.S. _Cash Box_ [12] | 3  \n  \n## Selected list of recorded\nversions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Brand_New_Key&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Selected list of recorded versions\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg) |  This article **needs additional citations for[verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability \"Wikipedia:Verifiability\")**.
