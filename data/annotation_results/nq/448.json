\"**Tiger** \" **Woods** (born December 30, 1975) is an\nAmerican [professional golfer](/wiki/Professional_golfer \"Professional\ngolfer\") who is among the most successful golfers of all time, and one of the\nmost popular athletes of the 21st century. He has been one of the [highest-\npaid athletes](/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_world%27s_highest-paid_athletes\n\"Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes\") in the world for several\nyears.[5][6][7] Woods is generally considered one of the greatest golfers of\nall time.[8][9][10]\n\nFollowing an outstanding junior, college, and amateur career, Woods was 20\nyears old when he turned professional at the end of summer in 1996. By the end\nof April 1997, he had won three [PGA Tour](/wiki/PGA_Tour \"PGA Tour\") events\nin addition to his first major, the [1997\nMasters](/wiki/1997_Masters_Tournament \"1997 Masters Tournament\"). Woods won\nthis tournament by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance and earned\n$486,000. He first reached the [number one\nposition](/wiki/List_of_World_Number_One_male_golfers \"List of World Number\nOne male golfers\") in the [world rankings](/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking\n\"Official World Golf Ranking\") in June 1997, less than a year after turning\npro. Throughout the 2000s, Woods was the dominant force in golf—he won the\n[2000 U.S. Open](/wiki/2000_U.S._Open_\\(golf\\) \"2000 U.S. Open \\(golf\\)\") by a\nrecord 15-shot margin. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August\n1999 to September 2004 (264 weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010\n(281 weeks).\n\nWoods took a self-imposed hiatus from professional golf from December 2009 to\nearly April 2010 to resolve marital issues. Woods and his estranged wife\n[Elin](/wiki/Elin_Nordegren \"Elin Nordegren\") eventually divorced. His many\nalleged extramarital indiscretions were revealed by several women, through\nmany worldwide media sources.[11] This coincided with a series of injuries,\ntreatments by the controversial doctor Anthony Galea, who had been linked to\nHGH,[12] and a loss of golf form. His placement in the Official World Golf\nRankings gradually fell to a low of No. 58 in November 2011.[13][14] He ended\na career-high winless streak of 107 weeks when he triumphed in the [Chevron\nWorld Challenge](/wiki/Chevron_World_Challenge \"Chevron World Challenge\") in\nDecember 2011.[14] After winning the [Arnold Palmer\nInvitational](/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational \"Arnold Palmer Invitational\")\non March 25, 2013, he ascended to the No.1 ranking once again, holding the top\nspot until May 2014, by which time he had been ranked number one for a record\ntotal of 683 weeks. From 2014–2017, Woods had been unable to recapture his\ndominant form, undergoing four [back surgeries](/wiki/Discectomy \"Discectomy\")\nin 2014, 2015 and 2017.[15] In May 2016, Woods dropped out of the world top\n500 for the first time in his professional career.[16] After falling to #1199\nin the World Golf Ranking in December 2017, Woods rose over 1000 places by\nmid-2018.[17][18] In September 2018, he won his first tournament in five years\nwith a victory at the [Tour Championship](/wiki/Tour_Championship \"Tour\nChampionship\") and moved to #13 in the [Official World Golf\nRankings](/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Rankings \"Official World Golf Rankings\").\n\nWoods has broken numerous golf records. He has been World Number One for the\nmost consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any\ngolfer. He has been awarded [PGA Player of the\nYear](/wiki/PGA_Player_of_the_Year \"PGA Player of the Year\") a record eleven\ntimes,[19] the [Byron Nelson Award](/wiki/Vardon_Trophy \"Vardon Trophy\") for\nlowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times, and has the record of\nleading the [money list](/wiki/PGA_Tour#Money_winners_and_most_wins_leaders\n\"PGA Tour\") in ten different seasons. He has won 14 professional [major golf\nchampionships](/wiki/Men%27s_major_golf_championships \"Men's major golf\nchampionships\"), where he trails only [Jack Nicklaus](/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus\n\"Jack Nicklaus\") who leads with 18, and 80 [PGA Tour](/wiki/PGA_Tour \"PGA\nTour\") events, second all-time behind [Sam Snead](/wiki/Sam_Snead \"Sam Snead\")\n(82).[20] Woods leads all active golfers in [career major\nwins](/wiki/List_of_men%27s_major_championships_winning_golfers \"List of men's\nmajor championships winning golfers\") and [career PGA Tour\nwins](/wiki/List_of_golfers_with_most_PGA_Tour_wins \"List of golfers with most\nPGA Tour wins\"). He is the youngest player to achieve the career [Grand\nSlam](/wiki/Grand_Slam_\\(golf\\) \"Grand Slam \\(golf\\)\"), and the youngest and\nfastest to win 50 tournaments on tour. Additionally, Woods is only the second\ngolfer (after Nicklaus) to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times.\nWoods has won 18 [World Golf Championships](/wiki/World_Golf_Championships\n\"World Golf Championships\"), and won at least one of those events in each of\nthe first 11 years after they began in 1999. Woods and [Rory\nMcIlroy](/wiki/Rory_McIlroy \"Rory McIlroy\") are the only golfers to win both\n[The Silver Medal](/wiki/The_Open_Championship#Silver_Medal_winners \"The Open\nChampionship\") and The Gold Medal at The Open Championship.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Background and family\n  * 2 Early life and amateur golf career\n  * 3 College golf career\n  * 4 Professional career\n    * 4.1 Honors\n    * 4.2 Endorsements\n    * 4.3 Accumulated wealth\n    * 4.4 Tiger-proofing\n  * 5 Career achievements\n    * 5.1 Major championships\n      * 5.1.1 Wins (14)\n      * 5.1.2 Results timeline\n      * 5.1.3 Summary\n    * 5.2 World Golf Championships\n      * 5.2.1 Wins (18)\n      * 5.2.2 Results timeline\n    * 5.3 PGA Tour career summary\n    * 5.4 _Guinness Book of Records_\n  * 6 Playing style\n  * 7 Equipment\n  * 8 Other ventures\n    * 8.1 Tiger Woods Foundation\n    * 8.2 Tiger Woods Design\n    * 8.3 Writings\n  * 9 Personal life\n    * 9.1 Marriage and children\n    * 9.2 Infidelity scandal and fallout\n    * 9.3 2017 arrest\n    * 9.4 Other pursuits\n  * 10 See also\n  * 11 References\n  * 12 Further reading\n  * 13 External links\n\n## Background and family\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Tiger_and_Earl_Woods_Fort_Bragg_2004.jpg/220px-\nTiger_and_Earl_Woods_Fort_Bragg_2004.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tiger_and_Earl_Woods_Fort_Bragg_2004.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tiger_and_Earl_Woods_Fort_Bragg_2004.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWoods and his father [Earl](/wiki/Earl_Woods \"Earl Woods\") at [Fort\nBragg](/wiki/Fort_Bragg \"Fort Bragg\"), [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina\n\"North Carolina\") in 2004\n\nWoods was born in 1975 in [Cypress, California](/wiki/Cypress,_California\n\"Cypress, California\"),[21] to [Earl](/wiki/Earl_Woods \"Earl Woods\")[22] and\nKultida \"Tida\" Woods.[23] He is the only child of their marriage, and has two\nhalf-brothers, Earl Jr. and Kevin, as well as a half-sister named Royce from\nhis father's first marriage.[24]\n\nKultida (née Punsawad) is originally from [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand\n\"Thailand\"), where Earl had met her on a tour of duty in 1968. She is of mixed\n[Thai](/wiki/Thai_people \"Thai people\"), [Chinese](/wiki/Han_Chinese \"Han\nChinese\"), and [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_people \"Dutch people\") ancestry.[25] Earl\nwas a retired [lieutenant colonel](/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel \"Lieutenant\ncolonel\") and [Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\") veteran who was\nmostly [African American](/wiki/African_American \"African American\") with\ntraces of European descent. Earl's mother Maude Carter was light skinned. Some\npeople suggested that she had [Native\nAmerican](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas \"Indigenous peoples of the\nAmericas\") and Chinese ancestry.[26] Tiger refers to his ethnic make-up as\n_\"[Cablinasian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cablinasian\n\"wikt:Cablinasian\")\"_ (a [syllabic abbreviation](/wiki/Syllabic_abbreviation\n\"Syllabic abbreviation\") he coined from [**Ca** ucasian](/wiki/Caucasian_race\n\"Caucasian race\"), [**Bl** ack](/wiki/Black_people \"Black people\"), [American\n**In** dian](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native Americans in\nthe United States\"), and **[Asian](/wiki/Asian_people \"Asian people\")**).[27]\n\nWoods' first name—Eldrick—was coined by his mother because it began with \"E\"\n(for Earl) and ended with \"K\" (for Kultida). His middle name Tont is a\ntraditional Thai name. He was nicknamed Tiger in honor of his father's friend\nCol. Vuong Dang Phong, who had also been known as Tiger.[28]\n\nWoods' niece, [Cheyenne Woods](/wiki/Cheyenne_Woods \"Cheyenne Woods\"), played\nfor the [Wake Forest University](/wiki/Wake_Forest_Demon_Deacons \"Wake Forest\nDemon Deacons\") golf team and turned professional in 2012, when she made her\npro debut in the [LPGA Championship](/wiki/LPGA_Championship \"LPGA\nChampionship\").[29]\n\n## Early life and amateur golf career\n\nWoods grew up in [Orange County](/wiki/Orange_County,_California \"Orange\nCounty, California\"), California. He was a child prodigy who was introduced to\ngolf before the age of two by his athletic father, Earl Woods. Earl was a\nsingle-digit handicap amateur golfer who also was one of the earliest African-\nAmerican college [baseball](/wiki/Baseball \"Baseball\") players at [Kansas\nState University](/wiki/Kansas_State_University \"Kansas State\nUniversity\").[30] Tiger's father was a member of the military and had playing\nprivileges at the Navy golf course beside the [Joint Forces Training\nBase](/wiki/Joint_Forces_Training_Base_-_Los_Alamitos \"Joint Forces Training\nBase - Los Alamitos\") in [Los Alamitos](/wiki/Los_Alamitos,_California \"Los\nAlamitos, California\"), which allowed Tiger to play there. Tiger also played\nat the par 3 Heartwell golf course in [Long\nBeach](/wiki/Long_Beach,_California \"Long Beach, California\"), as well as some\nof the [municipals](/wiki/Golf_course#Municipal \"Golf course\") in Long\nBeach.[31]\n\nIn 1978, Tiger putted against comedian [Bob Hope](/wiki/Bob_Hope \"Bob Hope\")\nin a television appearance on _[The Mike Douglas\nShow](/wiki/The_Mike_Douglas_Show \"The Mike Douglas Show\")_. At age three, he\nshot a 48 over nine holes at the Navy course. At age five, he appeared in\n_[Golf Digest](/wiki/Golf_Digest \"Golf Digest\")_ and on\n[ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\")'s\n_[That's Incredible!](/wiki/That%27s_Incredible! \"That's Incredible!\")_[32]\nBefore turning seven, Tiger won the Under Age 10 section of the Drive, Pitch,\nand Putt competition, held at the Navy Golf Course in Cypress, California.[33]\nIn 1984 at the age of eight, he won the 9–10 boys' event, the youngest age\ngroup available, at the [Junior World Golf\nChampionships](/wiki/Junior_World_Golf_Championships \"Junior World Golf\nChampionships\").[34] He first broke 80 at age eight.[35] He went on to win the\nJunior World Championships six times, including four consecutive wins from\n1988 to 1991.[36][37][38][39][40]\n\nWoods' father Earl wrote that Tiger first defeated him at the age of 11 years,\nwith Earl trying his best. Earl lost to Tiger every time from then on.[41][42]\nWoods first broke 70 on a regulation golf course at age 12.[43]\n\nWhen Woods was 13 years old, he played in the 1989 Big I, which was his first\nmajor national junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro\n[John Daly](/wiki/John_Daly_\\(golfer\\) \"John Daly \\(golfer\\)\"), who was then\nrelatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group\nof juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to\nbeat Woods by only one stroke.[44] As a young teenager, Woods first met [Jack\nNicklaus](/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus \"Jack Nicklaus\") in Los Angeles at the [Bel-Air\nCountry Club](/wiki/Bel-Air_Country_Club \"Bel-Air Country Club\"), when\nNicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the\nshow, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and\npotential.[45] Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments\nof Nicklaus and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.[43]\n\nWoods was 15-years-old and a student at [Western High\nSchool](/wiki/Western_High_School_\\(Anaheim,_California\\) \"Western High School\n\\(Anaheim, California\\)\") in Anaheim when he became the youngest [U.S. Junior\nAmateur](/wiki/U.S._Junior_Amateur \"U.S. Junior Amateur\") champion; this was a\nrecord that stood until it was broken by Jim Liu in 2010.[46] He was named\n1991's [Southern California Amateur Player of the\nYear](/w/index.php?title=Southern_California_Amateur_Player_of_the_Year&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Southern California Amateur Player of the Year \\(page does not exist\\)\") (for\nthe second consecutive year) and Golf Digest Junior Amateur Player of the\nYear. In 1992, he defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship,\nbecoming the tournament's first two-time winner. He also competed in his first\nPGA Tour event, the [Nissan Los Angeles Open](/wiki/Nissan_Los_Angeles_Open\n\"Nissan Los Angeles Open\") (he missed the 36-hole cut), and was named Golf\nDigest Amateur Player of the Year, Golf World Player of the Year, and Golfweek\nNational Amateur of the Year.[47][48]\n\nThe following year, Woods won his third consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur\nChampionship; he remains the event's only three-time winner.[49] In 1994, at\nthe [TPC at Sawgrass](/wiki/TPC_at_Sawgrass \"TPC at Sawgrass\") in Florida, he\nbecame the youngest winner of the [U.S. Amateur\nChampionship](/wiki/United_States_Amateur_Championship_\\(golf\\) \"United States\nAmateur Championship \\(golf\\)\"), a record he held until 2008 when it was\nbroken by [Danny Lee](/wiki/Danny_Lee_\\(golfer\\) \"Danny Lee \\(golfer\\)\").[50]\nHe was a member of the American team at the 1994 [Eisenhower\nTrophy](/wiki/Eisenhower_Trophy \"Eisenhower Trophy\") [World Amateur Golf Team\nChampionships](/wiki/World_Amateur_Golf_Team_Championships \"World Amateur Golf\nTeam Championships\") (winning), and the 1995 [Walker Cup](/wiki/Walker_Cup\n\"Walker Cup\") (losing).[51][52]\n\nWoods graduated from Western High School at age 18 in 1994 and was voted \"Most\nLikely to Succeed\" among the graduating class. He had starred for the high\nschool's golf team under coach Don Crosby.[53]\n\nWoods overcame difficulties with [stuttering](/wiki/Stuttering \"Stuttering\")\nas a boy.[54][55][56] This was not known until he wrote a letter to a boy who\ncontemplated suicide. Woods wrote, \"I know what it's like to be different and\nto sometimes not fit in. I also stuttered as a child and I would talk to my\ndog and he would sit there and listen until he fell asleep. I also took a\nclass for two years to help me, and I finally learned to stop.\"[57]\n\n## College golf career\n\nWoods was heavily recruited by college golf powers. He chose [Stanford\nUniversity](/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal \"Stanford Cardinal\"), the 1994\n[NCAA](/wiki/NCAA \"NCAA\") champions.

Some sources have credited him for dramatically increasing\nprize money in golf, generating interest in new PGA tournament audiences, and\nfor drawing the largest TV ratings in golf\nhistory.[69][145][146][147][148][149]\n\n### Endorsements\n\nDuring the first decade of his professional career, Woods was the world's most\nmarketable athlete.[150] Shortly after his 21st birthday in 1996, he signed\nendorsement deals with numerous companies, including [General\nMotors](/wiki/General_Motors \"General Motors\"), [Titleist](/wiki/Titleist\n\"Titleist\"), [General Mills](/wiki/General_Mills \"General Mills\"), [American\nExpress](/wiki/American_Express \"American Express\"),\n[Accenture](/wiki/Accenture \"Accenture\"), and [Nike, Inc.](/wiki/Nike,_Inc.\n\"Nike, Inc.\") In 2000, he signed a 5-year, $105 million contract extension\nwith Nike, which was the largest endorsement package signed by a professional\nathlete at that time.[151] Woods' endorsement has been credited with playing a\nsignificant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a \"start-up\" golf company\nearlier in the previous decade to becoming the leading golf apparel company in\nthe world and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market.[150][152]\nNike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport, with an estimated\n$600 million in sales.[153] Woods has been described as the \"ultimate\nendorser\" for Nike Golf,[153] frequently seen wearing Nike gear during\ntournaments, and even in advertisements for other products.[151] Woods\nreceives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel, footwear, golf\nequipment, golf balls,[150] and has a building named after him at Nike's\nheadquarters campus in [Beaverton](/wiki/Beaverton,_Oregon \"Beaverton,\nOregon\"), Oregon.[154]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/US_Navy_040303-N-5319A-001_Tiger_Woods_meets_Commander_Carrier_Group_Eight_%28CCG-8%29_Rear_Adm._Denby_H._Starling_II%2C_on_the_flag_bridge_aboard_the_aircraft_carrier_USS_George_Washington_%28CVN_73%29.jpg/220px-\nthumbnail.jpg)](/wiki/File:US_Navy_040303-N-5319A-001_Tiger_Woods_meets_Commander_Carrier_Group_Eight_\\(CCG-8\\)_Rear_Adm._Denby_H._Starling_II,_on_the_flag_bridge_aboard_the_aircraft_carrier_USS_George_Washington_\\(CVN_73\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:US_Navy_040303-N-5319A-001_Tiger_Woods_meets_Commander_Carrier_Group_Eight_\\(CCG-8\\)_Rear_Adm._Denby_H._Starling_II,_on_the_flag_bridge_aboard_the_aircraft_carrier_USS_George_Washington_\\(CVN_73\\).jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nWoods visiting aircraft carrier [USS  _George Washington_\n(CVN-73)](/wiki/USS_George_Washington_\\(CVN-73\\) \"USS George Washington\n\\(CVN-73\\)\") in the [Persian Gulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf \"Persian Gulf\") before\nparticipating in the 2004 [Dubai Desert Classic](/wiki/Dubai_Desert_Classic\n\"Dubai Desert Classic\")\n\nIn 2002, Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of\n[Buick](/wiki/Buick \"Buick\")'s [Rendezvous](/wiki/Buick_Rendezvous \"Buick\nRendezvous\") [SUV](/wiki/SUV \"SUV\"). A company spokesman stated that Buick was\nhappy with the value of Woods' endorsement, pointing out that more than\n130,000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003. \"That exceeded our\nforecasts,\" he was quoted as saying, \"It has to be in recognition of Tiger.\"\nIn February 2004, Buick renewed Woods' endorsement contract for another five\nyears, in a deal reportedly worth $40 million.[151]\n\nWoods collaborated closely with [TAG Heuer](/wiki/TAG_Heuer \"TAG Heuer\") to\ndevelop the world's first professional golf watch, which was released in April\n2005.[155] The lightweight, [titanium](/wiki/Titanium \"Titanium\")-construction\nwatch, designed to be worn while playing the game, incorporates numerous\ninnovative design features to accommodate golf play. It is capable of\nabsorbing up to 5,000 [Gs](/wiki/G-force \"G-force\") of shock, far in excess of\nthe forces generated by a normal golf swing.[155] In 2006, the TAG Heuer\n_Professional Golf Watch_ won the prestigious _[iF product design\naward](/wiki/IF_product_design_award \"IF product design award\")_ in the\nLeisure/Lifestyle category.[156]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Woods_photo_shoot.jpg/170px-\nWoods_photo_shoot.jpg)](/wiki/File:Woods_photo_shoot.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Woods_photo_shoot.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWoods preparing for a photo shoot in 2006\n\nWoods also endorsed the [Tiger Woods PGA Tour](/wiki/Tiger_Woods_PGA_Tour\n\"Tiger Woods PGA Tour\") series of video games; he has done so since 1999.[157]\nIn 2006, he signed a six-year contract with [Electronic\nArts](/wiki/Electronic_Arts \"Electronic Arts\"), the series' publisher.[158]\n\nIn February 2007, Woods, [Roger Federer](/wiki/Roger_Federer \"Roger Federer\")\nand [Thierry Henry](/wiki/Thierry_Henry \"Thierry Henry\") became ambassadors\nfor the \"[Gillette](/wiki/Global_Gillette \"Global Gillette\") Champions\"\nmarketing campaign. Gillette did not disclose financial terms, though an\nexpert estimated the deal could total between $10 million and $20\nmillion.[159]\n\nIn October 2007, [Gatorade](/wiki/Gatorade \"Gatorade\") announced that Woods\nwould have his own brand of sports drink starting in March 2008. \"Gatorade\nTiger\" was his first U.S. deal with a beverage company and his first licensing\nagreement. Although no figures were officially disclosed, _Golfweek_ magazine\nreported that it was for five years and could pay him as much as $100\nmillion.[160] The company decided in early fall 2009 to discontinue the drink\ndue to weak sales.[161]\n\nIn October 2012, it was announced that Woods had signed an exclusive\nendorsement deal with Fuse Science, Inc, a [sports\nnutrition](/wiki/Sports_nutrition \"Sports nutrition\") firm.[162]\n\nIn 1997, Woods and golfer [Arnold Palmer](/wiki/Arnold_Palmer \"Arnold Palmer\")\ninitiated a case against Bruce Matthews (the owner of Gotta Have It Golf,\nInc.) and others in the effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images\nand alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated\nparties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed\nseveral acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good\nfaith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices\nAct.[163] Palmer also was named in the counter-suit, accused of violating the\nsame licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer\nEnterprises.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, a Florida jury ruled in favor of Gotta Have It on its\nbreach of contract and other related claims, rejected ETW's counterclaims, and\nawarded Gotta Have It $668,346 in damages.[164][165] The award may end up\nexceeding $1 million once interest has been factored in, though the ruling may\nbe appealed.\n\nIn August 2016, Woods announced that he would be seeking a new golf equipment\npartner[166] after the news of Nike's exit from the equipment industry.[167]\nIt was announced on January 25, 2017, that he would be signing a new club deal\nwith [TaylorMade](/wiki/TaylorMade-Adidas \"TaylorMade-Adidas\").[168] He added\nthe 2016 M2 driver along with the 2017 M1 fairway woods, with irons to be\ncustom made at a later date. He also added his [Scotty\nCameron](/wiki/Scotty_Cameron \"Scotty Cameron\") Newport 2 GSS, a club he used\nto win 13 of his 14 majors.[169] Also, in late 2016, he would add [Monster\nEnergy](/wiki/Monster_Energy \"Monster Energy\") as his primary bag sponsor,\nreplacing MusclePharm.[170]\n\n### Accumulated wealth\n\nAccording to _Golf Digest_ , Woods made $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007,[171]\nand the magazine predicted that Woods would pass one billion dollars in\nearnings by 2010.[172] In 2009, _[Forbes](/wiki/Forbes \"Forbes\")_ confirmed\nthat Woods was indeed the world's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars\nin his career, after accounting for the $10 million bonus Woods received for\nthe [FedEx Cup](/wiki/FedEx_Cup \"FedEx Cup\") title.[173][174] The same year,\nForbes estimated his net worth to be $600 million, making him the second\nrichest [person of color](/wiki/Person_of_color \"Person of color\") in the\nUnited States, behind only [Oprah Winfrey](/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey \"Oprah\nWinfrey\").[175] In 2015, Woods ranked ninth in [Forbes' list of world's\nhighest-paid athletes](/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_world%27s_highest-paid_athletes\n\"Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes\"), being the top among Asian\nAmericans or the fourth among African Americans.[176] Woods is currently\nconsidered to be the highest-paid golfer.[177]\n\n### Tiger-proofing\n\nEarly in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about\nhis impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of\nprofessional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of [Knight\nRidder](/wiki/Knight_Ridder \"Knight Ridder\") asked in a column, \"Isn't Tiger\nWoods actually bad for golf?\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was\nnot).[178] At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of\ncompetition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and\nrelegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.\n\nA related effect was measured by [University of\nCalifornia](/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley \"University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley\") economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers\nscored higher when competing against Woods than when he was not in the\ntournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one\nstroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was\non winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in\n2003–04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar\nskill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when\nfacing a \"superstar\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise\none's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading\nto reduced effort.[179]\n\nMany courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like\n[Augusta National](/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club \"Augusta National Golf\nClub\")) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage\nof long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as \"Tiger-Proofing\".\nWoods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not\naffect his ability to win.[180]\n\n## Career achievements\n\nMain article: [List of career achievements by Tiger\nWoods](/wiki/List_of_career_achievements_by_Tiger_Woods \"List of career\nachievements by Tiger Woods\")\n\nWoods has won 80 official [PGA Tour](/wiki/PGA_Tour \"PGA Tour\") events,\nincluding 14 [majors](/wiki/Men%27s_major_golf_championships \"Men's major golf\nchampionships\"). He is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at\nleast a share of the lead. Multiple golf experts have heralded Woods as \"the\ngreatest closer in history\".[181][182][183] He owns the lowest career scoring\naverage and the most career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history.\n\nWoods' victory at the [2013 Players\nChampionship](/wiki/2013_Players_Championship \"2013 Players Championship\")\nalso marked a win in his 300th [PGA Tour](/wiki/PGA_Tour \"PGA Tour\")\nstart.[184] He also won golf tournaments in his [100th](/wiki/WGC-\nBridgestone_Invitational#Winners \"WGC-Bridgestone Invitational\") (in 2000) and\n[200th](/wiki/Farmers_Insurance_Open#Winners \"Farmers Insurance Open\") (in\n2006) tour starts.[185][186]\n\nWoods has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world\nrankings. He is one of five players (along with [Gene\nSarazen](/wiki/Gene_Sarazen \"Gene Sarazen\"), [Ben Hogan](/wiki/Ben_Hogan \"Ben\nHogan\"), [Gary Player](/wiki/Gary_Player \"Gary Player\"), and [Jack\nNicklaus](/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus \"Jack Nicklaus\")) to have won all four\nprofessional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand\nSlam, and was the youngest to do so.[187] Woods is the only player to have won\nall four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in\nthe 2000–2001 seasons.\n\n  * **[PGA Tour wins

Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using \"inferior\nequipment\", which did not sit well with [Nike](/wiki/Nike,_Inc. \"Nike, Inc.\"),\n[Titleist](/wiki/Titleist \"Titleist\") or Woods.[193][194] During 2004, Woods\nfinally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and\n[graphite](/wiki/Graphite \"Graphite\") shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead\nspeed, made him one of the Tour's lengthiest players off the\n[tee](/wiki/Golf_tee \"Golf tee\") once again.\n\nDespite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an\nexcellent all-around game. Although in recent\nyears[_[when?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers\")_] he has typically been near\nthe bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is\ngenerally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his\nputting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is\nlargely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst\nprofessional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than\nmost.[195][196][197]\n\nFrom mid-1993 (while he was still an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost\nexclusively with leading swing coach [Butch Harmon](/wiki/Butch_Harmon \"Butch\nHarmon\"). From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of\nWoods' full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and\nbetter [kinesiology](/wiki/Kinesiology \"Kinesiology\"). The changes began to\npay off in 1999.[198] From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by [Hank\nHaney](/wiki/Hank_Haney \"Hank Haney\"), who worked on flattening his swing\nplane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy\ndropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 and was replaced by [Sean\nFoley](/wiki/Sean_Foley_\\(golf_instructor\\) \"Sean Foley \\(golf\ninstructor\\)\").[199]\n\n[Fluff Cowan](/wiki/Mike_Cowan \"Mike Cowan\") served as Woods'\n[caddie](/wiki/Caddie \"Caddie\") from the start of his professional career\nuntil Woods dismissed him in March 1999.[200] He was replaced by [Steve\nWilliams](/wiki/Steve_Williams_\\(caddy\\) \"Steve Williams \\(caddy\\)\"), who\nbecame a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key\nshots and putts.[201] In June 2011, Woods dismissed Williams and replaced him\nwith friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of\nboth [Fred Couples](/wiki/Fred_Couples \"Fred Couples\") and [Dustin\nJohnson](/wiki/Dustin_Johnson \"Dustin Johnson\"), was hired by Woods shortly\nafter[202] and has remained Woods' caddie since then, but he has seen limited\nwork.\n\n## Equipment\n\n**As of\n2018[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tiger_Woods&action=edit)\nTour Championship[203]:**\n\n  * [Driver](/wiki/Wood_\\(golf\\) \"Wood \\(golf\\)\"): [TaylorMade](/wiki/TaylorMade-Adidas \"TaylorMade-Adidas\") M3 460 (Mitsubishi Chemical Diamana D+ White Board 73TX shaft), 9.5 degrees\n  * [Fairway woods](/wiki/Wood_\\(golf\\) \"Wood \\(golf\\)\"): [TaylorMade](/wiki/TaylorMade-Adidas \"TaylorMade-Adidas\") M3 13 & 19 Degree (Mitsubishi Chemical Diamana D+ White Board 83TX shaft)\n  * [Irons](/wiki/Iron_\\(golf\\) \"Iron \\(golf\\)\"): [TaylorMade](/wiki/TaylorMade-Adidas \"TaylorMade-Adidas\") TW Phase1 Prototype (3-PW;

one in [Philadelphia](/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\");\nand one in [Stuart, Florida](/wiki/Stuart,_Florida \"Stuart, Florida\").[214]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Tiger_Woods_speaks_at_We_Are_One.JPG/220px-\nTiger_Woods_speaks_at_We_Are_One.JPG)](/wiki/File:Tiger_Woods_speaks_at_We_Are_One.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tiger_Woods_speaks_at_We_Are_One.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nWoods giving a speech at [We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the\nLincoln\nMemorial](/wiki/We_Are_One:_The_Obama_Inaugural_Celebration_at_the_Lincoln_Memorial\n\"We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial\")\n(January 2009)\n\nThe foundation benefits from the annual [Chevron World\nChallenge](/wiki/Chevron_World_Challenge \"Chevron World Challenge\") and [AT&T\nNational](/wiki/AT%26T_National \"AT&T National\") golf tournaments hosted by\nWoods.[212] In October 2011, the foundation hosted the first Tiger Woods\nInvitational at Pebble Beach.[215] Other annual fundraisers have included the\nconcert events Block Party, last held in 2009 in Anaheim, and Tiger Jam, last\nheld in 2011 in [Las Vegas](/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley \"Las Vegas Valley\") after a\none-year hiatus.[212][216][217][218]\n\n### Tiger Woods Design\n\nIn November 2006, Woods announced his intention to begin designing golf\ncourses around the world through a new company, [Tiger Woods\nDesign](/wiki/Tiger_Woods_Design \"Tiger Woods Design\").[219] A month later, he\nannounced that the company's first course would be in [Dubai](/wiki/Dubai\n\"Dubai\") as part of a 25.3 million-square-foot development, [The Tiger Woods\nDubai](/wiki/The_Tiger_Woods_Dubai \"The Tiger Woods Dubai\").[220] The Al\nRuwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009.[220]\nAs of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, _The\nNew York Times_ reported that the project had been shelved\npermanently.[221][222] In 2013, the partnership between Tiger Woods Design and\nDubai Holding was dissolved.[223]\n\nTiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses, neither of which has\nmaterialized. In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a\nprivate course in the [Blue Ridge Mountains](/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Mountains \"Blue\nRidge Mountains\") near [Asheville, North\nCarolina](/wiki/Asheville,_North_Carolina \"Asheville, North Carolina\").[224]\nAfter a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow\nproblems and suspended construction.[222] A third course, in [Punta\nBrava](/wiki/Punta_Brava_Golf_Club \"Punta Brava Golf Club\"),\n[Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\"), was announced in October 2008, but incurred\ndelays due to issues with permits and an [environmental impact\nstudy](/wiki/Environmental_impact_study \"Environmental impact\nstudy\").[222][225] Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet\nbegun.[222]\n\nThese projects have encountered problems that have been attributed to factors\nthat include overly optimistic estimates of their value, declines throughout\nthe global economy (particularly the [U.S. crash in home\nprices](/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble \"United States housing bubble\")),\nand the decreased appeal and marketability of Woods following his 2009\ninfidelity scandal.[222]\n\n### Writings\n\nWoods wrote a golf instruction column for _[Golf Digest](/wiki/Golf_Digest\n\"Golf Digest\")_ magazine from 1997 to February 2011.[226] In 2001 he wrote a\nbest-selling golf instruction book, _How I Play Golf_ , which had the largest\nprint run of any golf book for its first edition, 1.5 million copies.[227] In\nMarch 2017, he published a memoir, _The 1997 Masters: My Story_ , co-authored\nby [Lorne Rubenstein](/wiki/Lorne_Rubenstein \"Lorne Rubenstein\"), which\nfocuses on his first Masters win.[228]\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Marriage and children\n\nIn November 2003, Woods became engaged to [Elin\nNordegren](/wiki/Elin_Nordegren \"Elin Nordegren\"), a Swedish former model and\ndaughter of former minister of migration [Barbro\nHolmberg](/wiki/Barbro_Holmberg \"Barbro Holmberg\") and radio journalist\n[Thomas Nordegren](/wiki/Thomas_Nordegren \"Thomas Nordegren\").[229] They were\nintroduced during The Open Championship in 2001 by Swedish golfer [Jesper\nParnevik](/wiki/Jesper_Parnevik \"Jesper Parnevik\"), who had employed her as an\n[au pair](/wiki/Au_pair \"Au pair\"). They married on October 5, 2004, at the\n[Sandy Lane resort](/wiki/Sandy_Lane_\\(resort\\) \"Sandy Lane \\(resort\\)\") in\n[Barbados](/wiki/Barbados \"Barbados\"), and lived at\n[Isleworth](/wiki/Isleworth,_Windermere,_Florida \"Isleworth, Windermere,\nFlorida\"), a community in [Windermere](/wiki/Windermere,_Florida \"Windermere,\nFlorida\"), a suburb of [Orlando, Florida](/wiki/Orlando,_Florida \"Orlando,\nFlorida\").[230][231] In 2006, they purchased a $39-million estate in [Jupiter\nIsland, Florida](/wiki/Jupiter_Island,_Florida \"Jupiter Island, Florida\"), and\nbegan constructing a 10,000-square-foot home; Woods moved there in 2010\nfollowing the couple's divorce.[5][231]\n\nWoods and Nordegren's first child was a girl born in 2007, whom they named Sam\nAlexis Woods. Woods chose the name because his own father had always called\nhim Sam.[232] Their son, Charlie Axel Woods, was born in 2009.[233]\n\n### Infidelity scandal and fallout\n\nIn November 2009, the _[National Enquirer](/wiki/National_Enquirer \"National\nEnquirer\")_ published a story claiming that Woods had had an [extramarital\naffair](/wiki/Extramarital_sex \"Extramarital sex\") with New York City\nnightclub manager [Rachel Uchitel](/wiki/Rachel_Uchitel \"Rachel Uchitel\"), who\ndenied the claim.[234][235] Two days later, around 2:30 a.m. on November 27,\nWoods was driving from his Florida mansion in his [Cadillac\nEscalade](/wiki/Cadillac_Escalade \"Cadillac Escalade\") SUV when he collided\nwith a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges near his home.[236] He was\ntreated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless\ndriving.[236][237] Following intense media speculation about the cause of the\naccident, Woods released a statement on his website and took sole\nresponsibility for the accident, calling it a \"private matter\" and crediting\nhis wife for helping him from the car.[238][239] On November 30, Woods\nannounced that he would not be appearing at his own charity golf tournament,\nthe [Chevron World Challenge](/wiki/Chevron_World_Challenge \"Chevron World\nChallenge\"), nor any other tournaments in 2009, due to his injuries.[240]\n\nOn December 2, following _[Us Weekly](/wiki/Us_Weekly \"Us Weekly\")_ 's\nprevious day reporting of a purported mistress and subsequent release of a\nvoicemail message allegedly left by Woods for the woman,[241] Woods released a\nfurther statement. He admitted \"transgressions\" and apologized to \"all of\nthose who have supported [him] over the years\", while reiterating his and his\nfamily's right to privacy.[235][242] Over the next few days, more than a dozen\nwomen claimed in various media outlets to have had affairs with Woods.[11] On\nDecember 11, he released a third statement admitting to infidelity and\napologizing again, as well as announcing that he would be taking \"an\nindefinite break from professional golf.\"[11]\n\nIn the days and months following Woods's admission of multiple infidelities,\nseveral companies re-evaluated their relationships with him.\n[Accenture](/wiki/Accenture \"Accenture\"), [AT&T](/wiki/AT%26T_Inc. \"AT&T\nInc.\"), [Gatorade](/wiki/Gatorade \"Gatorade\") and [General\nMotors](/wiki/General_Motors \"General Motors\") completely ended their\nsponsorship deals, while [Gillette](/wiki/Gillette_\\(brand\\) \"Gillette\n\\(brand\\)\") suspended advertising featuring Woods.[98][243][244] [TAG\nHeuer](/wiki/TAG_Heuer \"TAG Heuer\") dropped Woods from advertising in December\n2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August\n2011.[98] _[Golf Digest](/wiki/Golf_Digest \"Golf Digest\")_ suspended Woods's\nmonthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue.[245] In contrast,\n[Nike](/wiki/Nike,_Inc. \"Nike, Inc.\") continued to support Woods, as did\n[Electronic Arts](/wiki/Electronic_Arts \"Electronic Arts\"), which was working\nwith Woods on the game _[Tiger Woods PGA Tour\nOnline](/wiki/Tiger_Woods_PGA_Tour_Online \"Tiger Woods PGA Tour\nOnline\")_.[246] A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by\nWoods's affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.[247]\n\nOn February 19, 2010, Woods gave a televised statement in which he said he had\nundertaken a 45-day therapy program beginning at the end of December. He again\napologized for his actions. \"I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted\nto,\" he said. \"I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to\nenjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money\nand fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish.\"\nHe said he did not know yet when he would be returning to golf.[97][248] He\nannounced a few weeks later on March 16 that he would play in the [2010\nMasters Tournament](/wiki/2010_Masters_Tournament \"2010 Masters Tournament\")\non April 8.[249]\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, Woods and his wife Elin divorced on August 23,\n2010.[250]\n\n### 2017 arrest\n\nOn May 29, 2017, Woods was arrested near his [Jupiter Island,\nFlorida](/wiki/Jupiter_Island,_Florida \"Jupiter Island, Florida\"), home by the\nPalm Beach County Sheriff's Office at about 3:00 a.m. EDT for driving under\nthe influence of alcohol or drugs. He was asleep in his car, which was\nstationary in a traffic lane with its engine running. He later stated that he\nwas taking prescription drugs and did not realize how they might interact\ntogether.[251][252][253] On July 3, 2017, Woods tweeted that he had completed\nan out-of-state intensive program to tackle an unspecified issue.[254] On\nAugust 9, 2017, Woods, who skipped his arraignment,[255] entered a not guilty\nplea through his attorney Douglas Duncan and agreed to take part in a first-\ntime DUI offender program and attend another arraignment on October 25.[256]\n\nAt a hearing on October 27, 2017, Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving. He\nreceived a year of probation, was fined $250, and ordered to undergo 50 hours\nof [community service](/wiki/Community_service \"Community service\") along with\nregular drug tests. He was not allowed to drink alcohol during the probation,\nand if he violates the probation he will be sentenced to 90 days in jail with\nan additional $500 fine.[257]\n\n### Other pursuits\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Barack_Obama_meets_Tiger_Woods_4-20-09.jpg/220px-\nBarack_Obama_meets_Tiger_Woods_4-20-09.jpg)](/wiki/File:Barack_Obama_meets_Tiger_Woods_4-20-09.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Barack_Obama_meets_Tiger_Woods_4-20-09.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nUnited States President [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\") and\nWoods meet in the [Oval Office](/wiki/Oval_Office \"Oval Office\"), April 2009\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Tiger_Woods_at_Naval_Base_Coronado_2006-05-31.jpg/220px-\nTiger_Woods_at_Naval_Base_Coronado_2006-05-31.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tiger_Woods_at_Naval_Base_Coronado_2006-05-31.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Tiger_Woods_at_Naval_Base_Coronado_2006-05-31.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWoods shoots a handgun at a shooting range outside San Diego.\n\nWoods was raised as a [Buddhist](/wiki/Buddhism \"Buddhism\"), and he actively\npracticed his faith from childhood until well into his adult, professional\ngolf career.[258] In a 2000 article, Woods was quoted as saying that he\n\"believes in Buddhism... not every aspect, but most of it.\"[259] He has\nattributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He\nsaid, \"Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn\nrestraint. Obviously I lost track of what I was taught.\"[260]\n\nWoods is registered as an [independent](/wiki/Independent_\\(voter\\)\n\"Independent \\(voter\\)\") voter.[261] In January 2009, Woods delivered a speech\ncommemorating the military at the [We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration\nat the Lincoln\nMemorial](/wiki/We_Are_One:_The_Obama_Inaugural_Celebration_at_the_Lincoln_Memorial\n\"We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln\nMemorial\").[262][263] In April 2009, Woods visited the [White\nHouse](/wiki/White_House \"White House\") while promoting the golf tournament he\nhosts, the [AT&T National](/wiki/AT%26T_National \"AT&T National\").[264] In\nDecember 2016 and again in November 2017, Woods played golf with President\n[Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") at the [Trump International\nGolf Club](/wiki/Trump_International_Golf_Club_\\(West_Palm_Beach\\) \"Trump\nInternational Golf Club \\(West Palm Beach\\)\") in [West Palm\nBeach](/wiki/West_Palm_Beach \"West Palm Beach\").[265]\n\nWoods underwent [laser eye surgery](/wiki/Refractive_surgery \"Refractive\nsurgery\") in 1999. Before this surgery, he was severely myopic, his eyesight\nhaving a rating of 11 [diopters](/wiki/Dioptre \"Dioptre\"). The surgery was\nsuccessful (it has meant that he does not need to wear glasses or use contact\nlenses)[266], as he immediately started winning tour events. He received money\nfrom TLC Laser Eye Centers to endorse them.[267] In 2007, he had further laser\neye surgery when his vision began to deteriorate again.[268]\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Woods announced that he and Olympic gold medal skier\n[Lindsey Vonn](/wiki/Lindsey_Vonn \"Lindsey Vonn\") were dating.[269] They split\nup in May 2015.[270]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Career Grand Slam Champions](/wiki/Grand_Slam_\\(golf\\)#Career_Grand_Slam \"Grand Slam \\(golf\\)\")\n  * [List of golfers with most European Tour wins](/wiki/List_of_golfers_with_most_European_Tour_wins \"List of golfers with most European Tour wins\")\n  * [List of golfers with most PGA Tour wins](/wiki/List_of_golfers_with_most_PGA_Tour_wins \"List of golfers with most PGA Tour wins\")\n  * [List of golfers with most wins in one PGA Tour event](/wiki/List_of_golfers_with_most_wins_in_one_PGA_Tour_event \"List of golfers with most wins in one PGA Tour event\")\n  * [List of longest PGA Tour win streaks](/wiki/List_of_longest_PGA_Tour_win_streaks \"List of longest PGA Tour win streaks\")\n  * [List of men's major championships winning golfers](/wiki/List_of_men%27s_major_championships_winning_golfers \"List of men's major championships winning golfers\")\n  * [List of World Number One male golfers](/wiki/List_of_World_Number_One_male_golfers \"List of World Number One male golfers\")\n  * [Most PGA Tour wins in a year](/wiki/Most_PGA_Tour_wins_in_a_year \"Most PGA Tour wins in a year\")\n\n  * [![P vip.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/21px-P_vip.svg.png)](/wiki/File:P_vip.svg)[Biography portal](/wiki/Portal:Biography \"Portal:Biography\")\n  * [![Golf ball.jpg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Golf_ball.jpg/21px-Golf_ball.jpg)](/wiki/File:Golf_ball.jpg)[Golf portal](/wiki/Portal:Golf \"Portal:Golf\")\n  * [![Flag of the United States.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/24px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_States.svg)[United States portal](/wiki/Portal:United_States \"Portal:United States\")\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ [\"Tiger Woods – Profile\"](http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.08793.html).
