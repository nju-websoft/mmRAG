One\nnight at 12:07 a.m., Conor is visited by the tree-like Monster, who tells\nConor it has come to tell him three true stories, after which Conor must tell\nthe Monster his own story: the truth behind his nightmare, which Conor refuses\nto do.\n\nFirst story\n\nAn old king who has lost his entire family (his sons being killed in fierce\nbattles and his wife committing suicide because of this), save a young\ngrandson, remarries a beautiful young woman. He dies before the prince comes\nof age, and many believe the queen poisoned the king. Not wanting to hand the\nkingdom over to the prince in a year, she plots to marry the prince and remain\nqueen. The prince runs away with a farm girl he loves. They stop and sleep\nunder a yew tree (the Monster), but in the morning he finds the young woman\nmurdered. The prince tells the villagers that the queen, a witch, must have\ndone it, and they rally to overthrow her. Before the commoners can reach the\nqueen, the Monster carries her away to a far-off land where she lives out the\nrest of her life in peace. Though she was indeed a witch, she did not kill the\nfarm girl or the king, who actually died of old age. The prince had murdered\nthe farm girl himself in order to inspire his people to back him into\noverthrowing the queen. After the queen was taken to safety by the Monster,\nthe prince continued to rule the kingdom in the grandfather's place.\n\nSecond story\n\nAn [apothecary](/wiki/Apothecary \"Apothecary\") follows old traditions and\nbeliefs, using herbs and brews to cure ailments. His business becomes less\npopular as a local [parson](/wiki/Parson \"Parson\") tells his congregation not\nto accept the apothecary's old ways. When the parson's two daughters become\nsick, the parson asks the apothecary to save their lives after all other\nresources are exhausted. When the apothecary asks why he should help a man who\nhas turned people away from his skills and denied him the yew tree, his best\nsource of healing ingredients, the parson promises to give him the tree and\ndeliver the parishioners to him as customers. Yet the apothecary says that he\ncannot help, and the girls die. The Monster awakens from the yew tree to\ndestroy the parson's house and raze it to the ground as punishment.\n\nWhile the apothecary was a greedy man, he was a healer and would have saved\nlives, including the girls', if the parson had allowed him his way of life.\nThe parson was a man of belief, but was willing to discard his beliefs when\nthey were in the way. The healing traditions followed by the apothecary\nrequire belief in order to work; without the parson's, the apothecary was\nunable to treat the two girls. Belief is half the cure.\n\nThird story\n\nA man was invisible because no one ever saw him. Tired of this, he summoned\nthe Monster to ensure people would notice him. After people do notice him\nhowever, the man finds himself more alone than before.\n\nFourth story\n\nConor must confront his nightmare to tell the fourth story. His mother has\nbeen pulled to the edge of a cliff by a sudden collapse of the ground, and\nConor must hold her hand to save her from falling. Eventually, his grip fails\nand his mother falls. The Monster forces Conor to confess the truth: Conor\nloosened his grip on purpose. While he could have held on longer, he let go in\norder to stop the pain of having to hold on.\n\nThrough the Monster, Conor ultimately understands that although he does not\nwant his mother to die, it is something he must accept, and he must not feel\nguilty for wanting it to be over so he does not have to feel pain anymore.\nAfter this, Conor returns, with the Monster by his side, to comfort his mother\none last time, and she dies at 12:07. He returns home with his grandmother,\nwith whom he has reached an understanding, and she gives Conor the room that\nused to be his mother's. In the room, he finds his mother's old art book,\nwhich depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing\nof his mother as a child with the Monster.\n\n##\nCast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Monster_Calls_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Cast\")]\n\n  * [Lewis MacDougall](/wiki/Lewis_MacDougall \"Lewis MacDougall\") as Conor O'Malley \n    * Max Golds as 5-year-old Conor\n  * [Sigourney Weaver](/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver \"Sigourney Weaver\") as Mrs. Clayton, Conor's strict grandmother who has a tense relationship with him.\n  * [Felicity Jones](/wiki/Felicity_Jones \"Felicity Jones\") as Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Clayton, Conor's mother who is diagnosed with an unspecified [terminal illness](/wiki/Terminal_illness \"Terminal illness\").\n  * [Toby Kebbell](/wiki/Toby_Kebbell \"Toby Kebbell\") as Liam O'Malley, Conor's father who is divorced from Lizzie and now lives in the United States.\n  * [Liam Neeson](/wiki/Liam_Neeson \"Liam Neeson\") as the \"Monster\" (voice and motion capture), a giant humanoid yew tree. \n    * Neeson also appears uncredited in a photograph as Conor's grandfather.\n    * [Tom Holland](/wiki/Tom_Holland_\\(actor\\) \"Tom Holland \\(actor\\)\"), who worked with Bayona on _[The Impossible](/wiki/The_Impossible_\\(2012_film\\) \"The Impossible \\(2012 film\\)\")_ , served as the stand-in for the Monster during one week of production.[5]\n  * James Melville as Harry, a school bully who frequently targets Conor.\n  * [Geraldine Chaplin](/wiki/Geraldine_Chaplin \"Geraldine Chaplin\") as the head teacher of Conor's school.\n\n##\nProduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=A_Monster_Calls_\\(film\\)&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Production\")]\n\nFocus Features bought the rights to the book in March 2014.[6] Patrick Ness,\nthe book's author, served as the film's screenwriter, with [J.
