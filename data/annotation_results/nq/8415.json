It was written and produced by [Lin-Manuel\nMiranda](/wiki/Lin-Manuel_Miranda \"Lin-Manuel Miranda\").[1] The song was\nperformed in the film by American actress and singer [Auliʻi\nCravalho](/wiki/Auli%CA%BBi_Cravalho \"Auliʻi Cravalho\") in her role as\n[Moana](/wiki/Moana_\\(Disney_character\\) \"Moana \\(Disney character\\)\").

Although Miranda has stressed that\nhe is still \"very proud of\" the song as a first draft, \"More\" was not good\nenough in retrospect because it merely expressed Moana's vague desire to see\nmore since she had already figured out everything about the island.[2][3] In\ncontrast, \"How Far I'll Go\" expresses a deeper, richer message: Moana's\nstruggle with the irresistible impulse to explore beyond the reef\nnotwithstanding her genuine love for her island, her family, and her\npeople.[2][3] As Miranda explained to _[People](/wiki/People_\\(magazine\\)\n\"People \\(magazine\\)\")_ : \"To me that's much more complicated than, 'I hate it\nhere and I want to get out,' ... To say, ‘I love it here, I love my parents,\nbut why can't I stop walking to the ocean and fantasizing about getting out of\nhere?' And questioning that instinct? It's even more confusing. And that's a\nvalid story too.\"[3]\n\nTo make himself write a song more compelling than \"More\", Miranda \"[went\nmethod](/wiki/Method_acting \"Method acting\")\".[2] According to Miranda, he\nlocked himself in his childhood bedroom at his parents' residence for an\nentire weekend in order to force his mind back to age 16 (the same age as\nMoana in the film), a time when he was facing what seemed like an \"impossible\ndistance\" between the reality of his pleasant middle-class childhood which had\nno connection to show business whatsoever, and his dreams of a career in show\nbusiness.[2] He was well aware that he was composing the next Disney \"I Want\"\nsong after \"[Let It Go](/wiki/Let_It_Go_\\(Disney_song\\) \"Let It Go \\(Disney\nsong\\)\")\" and that whatever he wrote had to be different from \"Let It Go\".[2]\n\n## Music\nvideo[[edit](/w/index.php?title=How_Far_I%27ll_Go&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Music video\")]\n\nA music video for the song was released on December 12, 2016.[4]\n\n## Other\nlanguages[[edit](/w/index.php?title=How_Far_I%27ll_Go&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Other languages\")]\n\nWhen the movie had its first theater release worldwide, the song numbered 44\nversions, including a special [Tahitian](/wiki/Tahitian_language \"Tahitian\nlanguage\")-language adaptation created specifically for the movie.[5] For\npromotional purposes, [South African](/wiki/South_Africa \"South Africa\")\nsinger [Lira](/wiki/Lira_\\(singer\\) \"Lira \\(singer\\)\")[6] and\n[Filipino](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\") singer and actress [Janella\nSalvador](/wiki/Janella_Salvador \"Janella Salvador\")[7] recorded their own\nEnglish-language versions of the song in order to play them over the end\ncredits on the South African and Filipino release of the film, while\n[Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesia \"Indonesia\") singer [Maudy\nAyunda](/wiki/Maudy_Ayunda \"Maudy Ayunda\") and [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysia\n\"Malaysia\") singer Ayda Jebat recorded their own versions of the song\nrespectively in [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language \"Indonesian\nlanguage\")[8] and [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysian_language \"Malaysian\nlanguage\")[9] language.\n\nOn December 15, a 5-languages mash-up was released online, featuring singers\nfrom [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia \"Southeast Asia\") countries:\n[Janella Salvador](/wiki/Janella_Salvador \"Janella Salvador\") from the\n[Philippines](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\"), [Maudy\nAyunda](/wiki/Maudy_Ayunda \"Maudy Ayunda\") from [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia\n\"Indonesia\"), [Myra Molloy](/wiki/Myra_Molloy \"Myra Molloy\") from\n[Thailand](/wiki/Thailand \"Thailand\"), Ayda Jebat from\n[Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia \"Malaysia\") and Trần Minh Như from\n[Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam \"Vietnam\").[10] Shortly thereafter, a 24-languages\nvideo was released on Disney's Vevo channel.[11]\n\nIn June 2017, a [Māori-language](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language \"Māori language\")\nversion of the movie, featuring four voice-actors from the original English\ncast, was announced.[12] Three weeks later, [New Zealander](/wiki/New_Zealand\n\"New Zealand\") Jaedyn Randell was introduced as Moana's singing voice. The\nmovie was released in September 2017.[13] In the same year, Shruti Rane\n([Hindi](/wiki/Hindi \"Hindi\")) reprised her role in the [Bengali-\nlanguage](/wiki/Bengali_language \"Bengali language\") version of the movie.\n\nIn November 2017, a [Hawaiian-language](/wiki/Hawaiian_language \"Hawaiian\nlanguage\") dubbing was announced to be under way, with Auliʻi Cravalho\nreprising her role as Moana.[14]\n\nshow\"How Far I'll Go\" worldwide  \n---  \nLanguage  | Performer[15] | Title  | Translation   \n[Arabic](/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic \"Modern Standard Arabic\") | [كارمن عصام
