The term gained popularity\nin the U.S. in the 1980s.[1]\n\nThe Rust Belt begins in western [New York](/wiki/New_York_\\(state\\) \"New York\n\\(state\\)\") and traverses west through [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania\n\"Pennsylvania\"), [West Virginia](/wiki/West_Virginia \"West Virginia\"),\n[Ohio](/wiki/Ohio \"Ohio\"), [Indiana](/wiki/Indiana \"Indiana\"), and the Lower\nPeninsula of [Michigan](/wiki/Michigan \"Michigan\"), ending in northern\n[Illinois](/wiki/Illinois \"Illinois\"), eastern [Iowa](/wiki/Iowa \"Iowa\"), and\nsoutheastern [Wisconsin](/wiki/Wisconsin \"Wisconsin\"). New England was also\nhard hit by industrial decline during the same era. Previously known as the\nindustrial heartland of America, industry has been declining in the region\nsince the mid-20th century due to a variety of economic factors, such as the\ntransfer of manufacturing further [West](/wiki/Western_United_States \"Western\nUnited States\"), increased [automation](/wiki/Automation \"Automation\"), and\nthe decline of the US steel and coal industries.[2] While some cities and\ntowns have managed to adapt by shifting focus towards\n[services](/wiki/Service_economy \"Service economy\") and high-tech industries,\nothers have not fared as well, witnessing rising poverty and declining\npopulations.[3]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n  * 2 Geography\n  * 3 History\n    * 3.1 Outcomes\n    * 3.2 Transformation\n  * 4 International equivalents\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 Further reading\n  * 8 External links\n\n## Background[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rust_Belt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Background\")]\n\nIn the 20th century, local economies in these states specialized in large-\nscale manufacturing of finished medium to heavy industrial and consumer\nproducts, as well as the transportation and processing of the raw materials\nrequired for heavy industry.[4] The area was referred to as the\n**Manufacturing Belt** ,[5] **Factory Belt** , or **Steel Belt** as distinct\nfrom the agricultural Midwestern states forming the so-called [Corn\nBelt](/wiki/Corn_Belt \"Corn Belt\") and [Great Plains](/wiki/Great_Plains\n\"Great Plains\") states that are often called the \"bread-basket of America\".[6]\n\nThe flourishing of industrial manufacturing in the region was caused in part\nby the close proximity to the [Great Lakes](/wiki/Great_Lakes \"Great Lakes\")\nwaterways, and abundance of paved roads, water canals and railroads. After the\ntransportation infrastructure linked the iron ore found in northern\n[Minnesota](/wiki/Minnesota \"Minnesota\"), [Wisconsin](/wiki/Wisconsin\n\"Wisconsin\") and [Upper Michigan](/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan \"Upper\nPeninsula of Michigan\") with the coal mined from [Appalachian\nMountains](/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains \"Appalachian Mountains\"), the Steel\nBelt was born. Soon it developed into the Factory Belt with its great American\nmanufacturing cities: [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago \"Chicago\"),\n[Buffalo](/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York \"Buffalo, New York\"),\n[Detroit](/wiki/Detroit \"Detroit\"), [Milwaukee](/wiki/Milwaukee \"Milwaukee\"),\n[Cincinnati](/wiki/Cincinnati \"Cincinnati\"), [Toledo](/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio\n\"Toledo, Ohio\"), [Cleveland](/wiki/Cleveland \"Cleveland\"), [St.\nLouis](/wiki/St._Louis \"St. Louis\"), and [Pittsburgh](/wiki/Pittsburgh\n\"Pittsburgh\") among others. This region for decades served as a magnet for\nimmigrants from Austria-Hungary, Poland and Russia who provided the industrial\nfacilities with inexpensive labor.[7]\n\nFollowing several \"boom\" periods [from the late-19th](/wiki/Gilded_Age \"Gilded\nAge\") to the [mid-20th century](/wiki/Postwar_economic_boom \"Postwar economic\nboom\"), cities in this area struggled to adapt to a variety of adverse\neconomic and social conditions. From 1979 to 1982, the US Federal Reserve\ndecided to raise the base interest rate in the United States to 19%. High\ninterest rates attracted wealthy foreign \"hot money\" into US banks and caused\nthe US dollar to appreciate. This made US products more expensive for\nforeigners to buy and also made imports much cheaper for Americans to\npurchase. The misaligned exchange rate was not rectified until 1986, by which\ntime Japanese imports in particular had made rapid inroads into US markets.[8]\nFrom 1987 to 1999, the US stock market went into stratospheric rise, and this\ncontinued to pull wealthy foreign money into US banks, which biased the\nexchange rate against manufactured goods. Related issues include the decline\nof the [iron and steel\nindustry](/wiki/Iron_and_steel_industry_in_the_United_States \"Iron and steel\nindustry in the United States\"), the movement of manufacturing to the\n[southeastern states](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\")\nwith their lower labor costs,[9] the layoffs due to the rise of\n[automation](/wiki/Automation \"Automation\") in industrial processes, the\n[decreased need for labor in making steel\nproducts](/wiki/History_of_Pittsburgh#Collapse_of_steel \"History of\nPittsburgh\"), the internationalization of American business, and the\n[liberalization](/wiki/Liberalization \"Liberalization\") of foreign trade\npolicies due to [globalization](/wiki/Globalization \"Globalization\").[10]\nCities struggling with these conditions shared several difficulties, including\n[population loss](/wiki/Shrinking_cities \"Shrinking cities\"), lack of\neducation, declining tax revenues, high unemployment and crime, drugs,\nswelling welfare rolls, deficit spending, and poor municipal credit\nratings.[11][12][13][14][15]\n\n## Geography[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rust_Belt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Geography\")]\n\nSee also: [Regional economics](/wiki/Regional_economics \"Regional economics\")\nand [Shrinking cities in the United\nStates](/wiki/Shrinking_cities_in_the_United_States \"Shrinking cities in the\nUnited States\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Rust-belt-\nmap.jpg/220px-Rust-belt-map.jpg)](/wiki/File:Rust-belt-map.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Rust-belt-map.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Rust Belt of the United States (red)\n\nAs people migrate, they often coin new names for their destinations.[16] Since\nthe term \"Rust Belt\" pertains to a set of economic and social conditions\nrather than to an overall geographical region of the United States _per se_ ,\nthe Rust Belt has no precise boundaries. The extent to which a community may\nhave been described as a \"Rust Belt city\" depends at least as much on how\ngreat a role industrial manufacturing played in its local economy in the past\nand how it does now, as on perceptions of the economic viability and living\nstandards of the present day.\n\nNews media occasionally refer to a patchwork of defunct centres of heavy\nindustry and manufacturing across the Great Lakes and mid-western United\nStates as the _snow belt_ ,[17] the _manufacturing belt_ , or the _factory\nbelt_ \\- because of their vibrant industrial economies in the past. This\nincludes most of the cities of the Midwest as far west as the [Mississippi\nRiver](/wiki/Mississippi_River \"Mississippi River\"), including St. Louis, and\nmany of those in the Great Lakes and Northern New York.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]. At the\ncentre of this expanse lies an area stretching from northern\n[Indiana](/wiki/Indiana \"Indiana\") and southern [Michigan](/wiki/Michigan\n\"Michigan\") in the west to [Upstate New York](/wiki/Upstate_New_York \"Upstate\nNew York\") in the east, where local tax revenues as of\n2004[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rust_Belt&action=edit)\nrelied more heavily on manufacturing than on any other sector.[18][19]\n\nBefore [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the cities in the\nRust Belt region were among the largest in the United States. However, by the\ntwentieth century's end their population had fallen the most in the\ncountry.[20]\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rust_Belt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nThe linking of the former [Northwest Territory](/wiki/Northwest_Territory\n\"Northwest Territory\") with the once-rapidly industrializing East Coast was\naffected through several large-scale [infrastructural\nprojects](/wiki/Infrastructure \"Infrastructure\"), most notably the [Erie\nCanal](/wiki/Erie_Canal \"Erie Canal\") in 1825, the [Baltimore and Ohio\nRailroad](/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad \"Baltimore and Ohio Railroad\") in\n1830, the [Allegheny Portage Railroad](/wiki/Allegheny_Portage_Railroad\n\"Allegheny Portage Railroad\") in 1834, and the consolidation of the [New York\nCentral](/wiki/New_York_Central_Railroad \"New York Central Railroad\") after\nthe [American Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\"). A\ngate was thereby opened between a variety of burgeoning industries on the\ninterior [North American](/wiki/North_America \"North America\") continent and\nthe markets not only of the large Eastern cities, but of [Western\nEurope](/wiki/Western_Europe \"Western Europe\") as well.[21]\n\nCoal, iron ore and other raw materials were shipped in from surrounding\nregions which emerged as major ports on the Great Lakes and served as\ntransportation hubs for the region with a proximity to railroad lines. Coming\nin the other direction were millions of European immigrants, who populated the\ncities along the Great Lakes shores with then-unprecedented speed. Chicago,\nfamously, was a rural trading post in the 1840s but grew to be as big as\n[Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\") by the time of the [1893 Columbian\nExposition](/wiki/1893_Columbian_Exposition \"1893 Columbian Exposition\").[21]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Sectors_of_US_Economy_as_Percent_of_GDP_1947-2009.png/550px-\nSectors_of_US_Economy_as_Percent_of_GDP_1947-2009.png)](/wiki/File:Sectors_of_US_Economy_as_Percent_of_GDP_1947-2009.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Sectors_of_US_Economy_as_Percent_of_GDP_1947-2009.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nSectors of the US Economy as percent of GDP 1947–2009.[22]\n\nEarly signs of the difficulty in the northern states were evident early in the\n20th century, before the \"boom years\" were even over. [Lowell,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts \"Lowell, Massachusetts\"), once the\ncentre of textile production in the United States, was described in the\nmagazine _Harper 's_ as a \"depressed industrial desert\" as early as 1931,[23]\nas its textile concerns were being uprooted and sent southward, primarily to\nthe Carolinas.

One source has been [globalization](/wiki/Globalization\n\"Globalization\") and the expansion of worldwide [free trade](/wiki/Free_trade\n\"Free trade\") agreements. Anti-globalization groups argue that trade with\ndeveloping countries has resulted in stiff competition from countries such as\n[China](/wiki/China \"China\") which pegs its currency to the dollar and has\nmuch lower prevailing wages, forcing domestic wages to drift downward. Some\neconomists are concerned that long-run effects of high [trade\ndeficits](/wiki/Balance_of_trade \"Balance of trade\") and outsourcing are a\ncause of economic problems in the U.S.[26][27] with high [external\ndebt](/wiki/External_debt \"External debt\") (amount owed to foreign lenders)\nand a serious deterioration in the United States [net international investment\nposition](/wiki/Net_international_investment_position \"Net international\ninvestment position\") (NIIP) (−24% of GDP).[25][28][29]\n\nSome economists contend that the U.S. is borrowing to fund consumption of\nimports while accumulating unsustainable amounts of debt.[25][29] On June 26,\n2009, Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, called for the United States\nto increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce,\ncommenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much in some areas and can no\nlonger rely on the financial sector and consumer spending to drive demand.[30]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Cargill_S_Superior_elevator.jpg/220px-\nCargill_S_Superior_elevator.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cargill_S_Superior_elevator.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Cargill_S_Superior_elevator.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA disused [grain elevator](/wiki/Grain_elevator \"Grain elevator\") in Buffalo\n\nSince the 1960s, the expansion of worldwide [free trade](/wiki/Free_trade\n\"Free trade\") agreements have been less favorable to U.S. workers. Imported\ngoods such as [steel](/wiki/Steel \"Steel\") cost much less to produce in [Third\nWorld](/wiki/Third_World \"Third World\") countries with cheap foreign labor\n(see [steel crisis](/wiki/Steel_crisis \"Steel crisis\")). Beginning with the\nrecession of 1970–71, a new pattern of deindustrializing economy emerged.\nCompetitive devaluation combined with each successive downturn saw traditional\nU.S. [manufacturing](/wiki/Manufacturing \"Manufacturing\") workers experiencing\nlay-offs. In general, in the Factory Belt employment in the manufacturing\nsector declined by 32.9% between 1969 and 1996.[31]\n\nWealth-producing primary and secondary sector jobs such as those in\nmanufacturing and computer software were often replaced by much-lower-paying\nwealth-consuming jobs such as those in retail and government in the\n[service](/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy \"Tertiary sector of the\neconomy\") sector when the economy recovered.[32]\n\nA gradual expansion of the U.S. trade deficit with China began in 1985. In the\nensuing years the U.S. developed a massive trade deficit with the East Asian\nnations of China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. As a result, the traditional\nmanufacturing workers in the region have experienced economic upheaval. This\neffect has devastated government budgets across the U.S. and increased\ncorporate borrowing to fund retiree benefits.[28][29] Some economists believe\nthat GDP and employment can be dragged down by large long-run trade\ndeficits.[32]\n\nA March 3, 2008 _[Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal \"The Wall\nStreet Journal\")_ editorial claimed that, while Ohio lost 10,000 jobs in the\npast decade, Texas created 1.6 million new jobs.

That includes growing new industrial base\nwith a pool of skilled labor, rebuilding the infrastructure and infrasystems,\ncreating R&D university-business partnerships, and close cooperation between\ncentral, state and local government and business.[47]\n\nNew types of R&D-intensive nontraditional manufacturing have emerged recently\nin Rust Belt, such as [biotechnology](/wiki/Biotechnology \"Biotechnology\"),\nthe [polymer](/wiki/Polymer_science \"Polymer science\") industry,\n[infotech](/wiki/Information_technology \"Information technology\"), and\n[nanotech](/wiki/Nanotechnology \"Nanotechnology\").\n[Infotech](/wiki/Information_technology \"Information technology\") in\nparticular creates a promising venue for the Rust Belt's revitalization.[48]\nAmong the successful recent examples is the Detroit Aircraft Corporation,\nwhich specializes in unmanned aerial systems integration, testing and aerial\ncinematography services.[49]\n\nIn Pittsburgh, robotics research centres and companies such as [National\nRobotics Engineering Center](/wiki/National_Robotics_Engineering_Center\n\"National Robotics Engineering Center\") and Robotics Institute, Aethon Inc.,\nAmerican Robot Corporation, Automatika, Quantapoint, Blue Belt Technologies\nand Seegrid are creating state-of-the-art robotic technology applications.\n[Akron](/wiki/Akron,_Ohio \"Akron, Ohio\"), a former \"Rubber Capital of the\nWorld\" that lost 35,000 jobs after major tire and rubber manufacturers\n[Goodrich](/wiki/Goodrich_Corporation \"Goodrich Corporation\"),\n[Firestone](/wiki/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company \"Firestone Tire and Rubber\nCompany\") and [General Tire](/wiki/General_Tire \"General Tire\") closed their\nproduction lines, is now again well known around the world as a centre of\npolymer research with four hundred polymer-related manufacturing and\ndistribution companies operating in the area. The turnaround was accomplished\nin part due to a partnership between [Goodyear Tire &\nRubber](/wiki/Goodyear_Tire_%26_Rubber \"Goodyear Tire & Rubber\"), which chose\nto stay, the [University of Akron](/wiki/University_of_Akron \"University of\nAkron\") and the city mayor's office. The Akron Global Business Accelerator\nthat jump-started a score of successful business ventures in Akron resides in\nthe refurbished B.F. Goodrich tire factory.[50]\n\n[Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing](/wiki/3D_printing \"3D printing\"),\ncreates another promising venue for the manufacturing resurgence. Such\ninnovative companies, as MakerGear from [Beachwood,\nOhio](/wiki/Beachwood,_Ohio \"Beachwood, Ohio\"), or ExOne Company from [North\nHuntingdon,\nPA](/wiki/North_Huntingdon_Township,_Westmoreland_County,_Pennsylvania \"North\nHuntingdon Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania\"), are designing and\nmanufacturing industrial and consumer products using 3-D imaging systems.[51]\nNot long ago, the London-based [Economist](/wiki/The_Economist \"The\nEconomist\") pointed towards a growing trend of\n[reshoring](/wiki/Insourcing#Terminology \"Insourcing\"), or\n[inshoring](/wiki/Inshoring \"Inshoring\"), of manufacture when a growing number\nof American companies are moving their production facilities from overseas\nback home.[52] Rustbelt states can ultimately benefit from this process of an\ninternational [insourcing](/wiki/Insourcing \"Insourcing\").\n\nHowever, automation has led to the types of manufacturing that requires fewer\nworkers even with advanced skills. That is why job gains in manufacture in\nRust Belt have not been nearly enough to keep pace with lay-offs.[53] As a\nresult, middle class incomes and savings in the Rustbelt states continue to be\nnegatively impacted.\n\nDelving into the past and musing on the future of Rustbelt states, the\n[Brookings Institution](/wiki/Brookings_Institution \"Brookings Institution\")\nreport suggests that the Great Lakes region has a sizable potential for\ntransformation, citing already existing global trade networks, clean\nenergy/low carbon capacity, developed innovation infrastructure and higher\neducational network.[54]\n\n## International\nequivalents[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rust_Belt&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: International equivalents\")]\n\nThe following regions, areas, and city are known to have some similarities to\nthe rust belt in the United States:\n\n  * [Northern England](/wiki/Northern_England \"Northern England\") – another former industrial centre which began declining in the 1980s\n  * [Southern Ontario](/wiki/Southern_Ontario \"Southern Ontario\") \\- [Canadian](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") counterpart, the Canadian Rust belt does not include [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\") and [Ottawa](/wiki/Ottawa \"Ottawa\")\n  * [Ruhr Area](/wiki/Ruhr_Area \"Ruhr Area\"), [Germany](/wiki/Germany \"Germany\")\n  * [Bergslagen](/wiki/Bergslagen \"Bergslagen\"), [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden \"Sweden\")\n  * [Nord-Pas-de-Calais](/wiki/Nord-Pas-de-Calais \"Nord-Pas-de-Calais\"), [France](/wiki/France \"France\")\n  * [Northeast China](/wiki/Northeast_China \"Northeast China\") – a former centre of heavy industry that declined for other reasons\n  * [Steel crisis](/wiki/Steel_crisis \"Steel crisis\")\n  * [Mindanao](/wiki/Mindanao \"Mindanao\"), [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines \"Philippines\")\n  * [Donbass](/wiki/Donbass \"Donbass\") \\- region in Eastern [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine \"Ukraine\")\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rust_Belt&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * ![flag](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png)[United States portal](/wiki/Portal:United_States \"Portal:United States\")\n  * [![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Emblem-money.svg)[Economy portal](/wiki/Portal:Economy \"Portal:Economy\")\n  * ![icon](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Terra.png/28px-Terra.png)[Geography portal](/wiki/Portal:Geography \"Portal:Geography\")\n\n  * [Dutch disease](/wiki/Dutch_disease \"Dutch disease\")\n  * [Outsourcing](/wiki/Outsourcing \"Outsourcing\")\n  * [Early 1980s recession in the United States](/wiki/Early_1980s_recession_in_the_United_States \"Early 1980s recession in the United States\")\n  * [Decline of Detroit](/wiki/Decline_of_Detroit \"Decline of Detroit\")\n  * [Economy of Youngstown, Ohio](/wiki/Economy_of_Youngstown,_Ohio \"Economy of Youngstown, Ohio\")\n  * [Shrinking cities in the United States](/wiki/Shrinking_cities_in_the_United_States \"Shrinking cities in the United States\")\n  * [Economy of the United States](/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States \"Economy of the United States\")\n  * [List of belt regions of the United States](/wiki/List_of_belt_regions_of_the_United_States \"List of belt regions of the United States\")\n  * [Deindustrialization](/wiki/Deindustrialization \"Deindustrialization\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Rust_Belt&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Crandall, Robert W. _The Continuing Decline of Manufacturing in the Rust Belt_.
