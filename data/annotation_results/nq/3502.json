In the upper left quadrant is\nthe famous intersection of [Hollywood and Highland\nCenter](/wiki/Hollywood_and_Highland_Center \"Hollywood and Highland Center\").\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce credits E.M. Stuart, its volunteer president\nin 1953, with the original idea for creating a Walk of Fame. Stuart reportedly\nproposed the Walk as a means to \"maintain the glory of a community whose name\nmeans glamour and excitement in the four corners of the world.\"[14] Harry\nSugarman, another Chamber member and president of the Hollywood Improvement\nAssociation, receives credit in an independent account.[15] A committee was\nformed to flesh out the idea, and an architectural firm was retained to\ndevelop specific proposals. By 1955 the basic concept and general design had\nbeen agreed upon, and plans were submitted to the [Los Angeles City\nCouncil](/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Council \"Los Angeles City Council\").\n\nMultiple accounts exist for the origin of the star concept. According to one,\nthe historic [Hollywood Hotel](/wiki/Hollywood_Hotel \"Hollywood Hotel\")—which\nstood for more than 50 years on Hollywood Boulevard at the site now occupied\nby the [Hollywood and Highland complex](/wiki/Hollywood_and_Highland\n\"Hollywood and Highland\") and the [Dolby (formerly Kodak)\nTheatre](/wiki/Dolby_Theatre \"Dolby Theatre\")[16]—displayed stars on its\ndining room ceiling above the tables favored by its most famous celebrity\npatrons, and that may have served as an early inspiration.[17] By another\naccount, the stars were \"inspired ... by Sugarman's [Tropics Restaurant]\ndrinks menu, which featured celebrity photos framed in gold stars.\"[15][18]\n\nIn February 1956 a prototype was unveiled featuring a\n[caricature](/wiki/Caricature \"Caricature\") of an example honoree ([John\nWayne](/wiki/John_Wayne \"John Wayne\"), by some accounts[19]) inside a blue\nstar on a brown background.[14] However, caricatures proved too expensive and\ndifficult to execute in brass with the technology available at the time; and\nthe brown and blue motif was vetoed by [Charles E.\nToberman](/wiki/Charles_E._Toberman \"Charles E. Toberman\"), the legendary real\nestate developer known as \"Mr. Hollywood\", because the colors clashed with a\nnew building he was erecting on Hollywood Boulevard.[14][20]\n\n### Selection and\nconstruction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Selection and construction\")]\n\nBy March 1956 the final design and coral-and-charcoal color scheme had been\napproved, and between the spring of 1956 and the fall of 1957, 1,558 honorees\nwere selected by committees representing the four major branches of the\nentertainment industry at that time: motion pictures, television, audio\nrecording, and radio. The committees met at the [Brown\nDerby](/wiki/Brown_Derby \"Brown Derby\") restaurant,[21] and included such\nprominent names as [Cecil B. DeMille](/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille \"Cecil B.\nDeMille\"), [Samuel Goldwyn](/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn \"Samuel Goldwyn\"), [Jesse L.\nLasky](/wiki/Jesse_L._Lasky \"Jesse L. Lasky\"), [Walt Disney](/wiki/Walt_Disney\n\"Walt Disney\"), [Hal Roach](/wiki/Hal_Roach \"Hal Roach\"), [Mack\nSennett](/wiki/Mack_Sennett \"Mack Sennett\"), and [Walter\nLantz](/wiki/Walter_Lantz \"Walter Lantz\").[14]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Hwof_joanne_woodward.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hwof_joanne_woodward.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hwof_joanne_woodward.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWoodward's star, contrary to popular belief, was not the first.\n\nA requirement stipulated by the original audio recording committee (and later\nrescinded) specified minimum sales of one million records or 250,000 albums\nfor all music category nominees. The committee soon realized that many\nimportant recording artists would be excluded from the Walk by that\nrequirement. As a result, the [National Academy of Recording Arts and\nSciences](/wiki/National_Academy_of_Recording_Arts_and_Sciences \"National\nAcademy of Recording Arts and Sciences\") was formed for the purpose of\ncreating a separate award system for the music business. The first [Grammy\nAwards](/wiki/Grammy_Award \"Grammy Award\") were presented in Beverly Hills in\n1959.[22]\n\nConstruction of the Walk began in 1958 but two lawsuits delayed completion.\nThe first was filed by local property owners challenging the legality of the\n[$](/wiki/United_States_dollar \"United States dollar\")1.25 million tax\nassessment levied upon them to pay for the Walk, along with new street\nlighting and trees. In October 1959 the assessment was ruled legal.[14] The\nsecond lawsuit, filed by [Charles Chaplin, Jr.](/wiki/Charles_Chaplin,_Jr.\n\"Charles Chaplin, Jr.\"), sought damages for the exclusion of his father, whose\nnomination had been withdrawn due to pressure from multiple quarters (see\n[Controversial additions](/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame#Controversial_additions\n\"Hollywood Walk of Fame\")). Chaplin's suit was dismissed in 1960, paving the\nway for completion of the project.[14][23][24]\n\nWhile [Joanne Woodward](/wiki/Joanne_Woodward \"Joanne Woodward\") is often\nsingled out as the first to receive a star on the Walk of Fame,[25] in fact\nthere was no \"first\" recipient; the original stars were installed as a\ncontinuous project, with no individual ceremonies. Woodward's name was one of\neight drawn at random from the original 1,558 and inscribed on eight prototype\nstars that were built while litigation was still holding up permanent\nconstruction.[26][27][28] The eight prototypes were installed temporarily on\nthe northwest corner of Hollywood Boulevard and [Highland\nAvenue](/wiki/Highland_Avenue_\\(Los_Angeles\\) \"Highland Avenue \\(Los\nAngeles\\)\") in August 1958 to generate publicity and to demonstrate how the\nWalk would eventually look.[14] The other seven names were [Olive\nBorden](/wiki/Olive_Borden \"Olive Borden\"), [Ronald\nColman](/wiki/Ronald_Colman \"Ronald Colman\"), [Louise\nFazenda](/wiki/Louise_Fazenda \"Louise Fazenda\"), [Preston\nFoster](/wiki/Preston_Foster \"Preston Foster\"), [Burt\nLancaster](/wiki/Burt_Lancaster \"Burt Lancaster\"), [Edward\nSedgwick](/wiki/Edward_Sedgwick \"Edward Sedgwick\"), and [Ernest\nTorrence](/wiki/Ernest_Torrence \"Ernest Torrence\").[14][29] Official\ngroundbreaking took place on February 8, 1960.[17] On March 28, 1960, the\nfirst permanent star, director [Stanley Kramer](/wiki/Stanley_Kramer \"Stanley\nKramer\")'s, was completed on the easternmost end of the new Walk near the\nintersection of Hollywood and Gower.[14][30] The Joanne Woodward legend may\nhave originated, according to one source, because she was the first to pose\nwith her star for photographers.[25]\n\n### Stagnation and\nrevitalization[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Stagnation and revitalization\")]\n\nThough the Walk was originally conceived in part to encourage redevelopment of\nHollywood Boulevard, the 1960s and 1970s were periods of protracted urban\ndecay in the Hollywood area as residents moved to suburbs.[31][32] After the\ninitial installation of approximately 1,500 stars in 1960 and 1961, eight\nyears passed without the addition of a new star. In 1962 the Los Angeles City\nCouncil passed an ordinance naming the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce \"the\nagent to advise the City\" about adding names to the Walk, and the Chamber,\nover the following six years, devised rules, procedures, and financing methods\nto do so.[14] In December 1968, [Richard D. Zanuck](/wiki/Richard_D._Zanuck\n\"Richard D. Zanuck\") was awarded the first star in eight years in a\npresentation ceremony hosted by [Danny Thomas](/wiki/Danny_Thomas \"Danny\nThomas\").[14][21][33] In July 1978 the [City of Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles\n\"Los Angeles\") designated the Hollywood Walk of Fame a [Los Angeles Historic-\nCultural Monument](/wiki/List_of_Los_Angeles_Historic-\nCultural_Monuments_in_Hollywood \"List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural\nMonuments in Hollywood\").[34]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Joe_Pasternak_Allan_Warren.jpg/220px-\nJoe_Pasternak_Allan_Warren.jpg)](/wiki/File:Joe_Pasternak_Allan_Warren.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Joe_Pasternak_Allan_Warren.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJohnny Grant, center, at producer [Joe Pasternak](/wiki/Joe_Pasternak \"Joe\nPasternak\")'s presentation ceremony in 1991.

His\nunique special-category star, with its emblem depicting a stylized \"Great Seal\nof the City of Hollywood\",[41] is located at the entrance to the Dolby Theatre\nadjacent to Johnny Grant Way.[42]\n\n###\nExpansion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Expansion\")]\n\nIn 1984 a fifth category, Live Theatre, was added to permit acknowledgment of\ncontributions from the live performance branch of the entertainment industry,\nand a second row of stars was created on each sidewalk to alternate with the\nexisting stars.[14]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Hollywood-walk-of-\nfame.jpg/170px-Hollywood-walk-of-fame.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hollywood-walk-of-\nfame.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hollywood-walk-of-fame.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nHollywood Boulevard, 7000 block, north side, looking westward\n\nIn 1994 the Walk of Fame was extended one block to the west on Hollywood\nBoulevard, from Sycamore Avenue to North LaBrea Avenue (plus the short segment\nof Marshfield Way that connects Hollywood and La Brea), where it now ends at\nthe silver \"Four Ladies of Hollywood\" gazebo and the special \"Walk of Fame\"\nstar.[43] At the same time, [Sophia Loren](/wiki/Sophia_Loren \"Sophia Loren\")\nwas honored with the 2,000th star on the Walk.[14]\n\nDuring construction of tunnels for the [Los Angeles subway\nsystem](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Metro_Rail \"Los Angeles Metro Rail\") in 1996, the\n[Metropolitan Transportation\nAuthority](/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority \"Los\nAngeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority\") removed and stored more\nthan 300 stars.[44] Controversy arose when the MTA proposed a money-saving\nmeasure of [jackhammering](/wiki/Jackhammer \"Jackhammer\") the 3-by-3-foot\nterrazzo pads, preserving only the brass lettering, surrounds, and medallions,\nthen pouring new terrazzo after the tunnels were completed;[45] but the\n[Cultural Heritage Commission](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Historic-Cultural_Monument\n\"Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument\") ruled that the star pads were to be\nremoved intact.[46]\n\n###\nRestoration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Restoration\")]\n\nIn 2008 a long-term restoration project began with an evaluation of all 2,365\nstars on the Walk at the time, each receiving a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or\nF. Honorees whose stars received F grades, indicating the most severe damage,\nwere [Joan Collins](/wiki/Joan_Collins \"Joan Collins\"), [Peter\nFrampton](/wiki/Peter_Frampton \"Peter Frampton\"), [Dick Van\nPatten](/wiki/Dick_Van_Patten \"Dick Van Patten\"), [Paul\nDouglas](/wiki/Paul_Douglas_\\(actor\\) \"Paul Douglas \\(actor\\)\"), [Andrew L.\nStone](/wiki/Andrew_L._Stone \"Andrew L.

The theater manager fired\nher on the spot for \"insubordination\" and humiliated her by stripping the\nepaulets from her uniform in the theater lobby. Twenty-six years later, at her\nrequest, Burnett's star was placed at the corner of Hollywood and Wilcox—in\nfront of the theater.[91]\n\n### Errors and\nmysteries[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Errors and mysteries\")]\n\nIn 2010, [Julia Louis-Dreyfus](/wiki/Julia_Louis-Dreyfus \"Julia Louis-\nDreyfus\")'s star was constructed with the name \"Julia Luis Dreyfus\".[92] The\nactress was reportedly amused, and the error was corrected.[93] A similar\nmistake was made on [Dick Van Dyke](/wiki/Dick_Van_Dyke \"Dick Van Dyke\")'s\nstar in 1993 (\"Vandyke\"), and rectified.[94]\n\n[![Monty Woolley's star, showing a \"TV\" emblem, even though his category is\n\"Motion\nPictures\"](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Monty_Woolley_star_HWF.JPG/220px-\nMonty_Woolley_star_HWF.JPG)](/wiki/File:Monty_Woolley_star_HWF.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Monty_Woolley_star_HWF.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\n\"Motion Picture\" category, \"TV\" emblem\n\nFilm and television actor [Don Haggerty](/wiki/Don_Haggerty \"Don Haggerty\")'s\nstar originally displayed the first name \"Dan\".

In 2000, [James Stewart](/wiki/James_Stewart\n\"James Stewart\")'s and [Kirk Douglas](/wiki/Kirk_Douglas \"Kirk Douglas\")'s\nstars disappeared from their locations near the intersection of Hollywood and\nVine, where they had been temporarily removed for a construction project.\nPolice recovered them in the suburban community of [South\nGate](/wiki/South_Gate,_California \"South Gate, California\") when they\narrested a man involved in an incident there and searched his house. The\nsuspect was a construction worker employed on the Hollywood and Vine project.\nThe stars had been badly damaged, and had to be remade. One of [Gene\nAutry](/wiki/Gene_Autry \"Gene Autry\")'s five stars (it is not clear which one)\nwas also stolen from a construction area. Johnny Grant later received an\nanonymous phone tip that the missing star was in Iowa, but it was never found.\n\"Someday, it will end up on eBay,\" Grant once joked. The most brazen and\nambitious theft occurred in 2005 when thieves used a [concrete\nsaw](/wiki/Concrete_saw \"Concrete saw\") to remove [Gregory\nPeck](/wiki/Gregory_Peck \"Gregory Peck\")'s star from its Hollywood Boulevard\nsite at the intersection of North El Centro Avenue, near North Gower. The star\nwas replaced almost immediately, but the original was never recovered and the\nperpetrators never caught.[117]\n\nIn late 2009, rumors circulated widely on media outlets and the Internet that\nJohn Lennon's star had been stolen, but it was merely being relocated farther\nsouth on Vine Street to an area near the circular [Capitol Records\nBuilding](/wiki/Capitol_Records_Building \"Capitol Records Building\"), adjacent\nto the stars of bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr.[118] Paul\nMcCartney's star was installed in the same location in 2012.[119]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Donald_Trump%27s_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_Star_being_repaired.jpg/220px-\nDonald_Trump%27s_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_Star_being_repaired.jpg)](/wiki/File:Donald_Trump%27s_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_Star_being_repaired.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Donald_Trump%27s_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_Star_being_repaired.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\")'s star was repaired soon\nafter it was destroyed on July 25, 2018.\n\n[Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\")'s star—received as host of\n_[The Apprentice](/wiki/The_Apprentice_\\(U.S._TV_series\\) \"The Apprentice\n\\(U.S. TV series\\)\")_ television series—was repeatedly defaced during the 2016\npresidential campaign.[120][121][122] In late October, near the end of the\nrace, a man named Jamie Otis (who claimed to be an heir to the [Otis\nElevator](/wiki/Otis_Elevator \"Otis Elevator\") fortune) used a sledge hammer\nand a pickaxe to destroy all of the star's brass inlays. He readily admitted\nto the vandalism, which he described as \"civil disobedience\" and \"freedom of\nexpression\", and told reporters that he originally planned to remove the\nentire star and auction it to raise money for the women who accused Trump of\nsexually assaulting them.[123] Otis was arrested three weeks after the\nincident, charged with one count of felony vandalism,[124] and sentenced to\nthree years' probation plus $3,400 in restitution payments.[125] The star\nitself was repaired, serving as the site of pro-Trump demonstrations[126]\nuntil it was destroyed a second time in July 2018 by a man named Austin\nClay.[127] Clay later surrendered himself to the police and was bailed out by\nJamie Otis.[128][129]\n\n### Four Ladies of\nHollywood[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Four Ladies of Hollywood\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/Four_Ladies_of_Hollywood_2008.jpg/170px-\nFour_Ladies_of_Hollywood_2008.jpg)](/wiki/File:Four_Ladies_of_Hollywood_2008.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Four_Ladies_of_Hollywood_2008.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe Four Ladies of Hollywood gazebo at the Walk of Fame's west end\n\nThe Four Ladies of Hollywood [gazebo](/wiki/Gazebo \"Gazebo\")[130]—known\nofficially as the Hollywood and La Brea Gateway[131]—stands upon a small\ntriangular island formed by the confluence of Hollywood Boulevard, Marshfield\nWay, and North La Brea Avenue at the westernmost extension of the Walk of\nFame. It was commissioned in 1993 by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment\nAgency Art Program and created by the architect, production designer, and film\ndirector [Catherine Hardwicke](/wiki/Catherine_Hardwicke \"Catherine\nHardwicke\") as a tribute to the multi-ethnic women of Hollywood.[131] The\ngazebo is a stainless steel stylized [Art Deco](/wiki/Art_Deco \"Art Deco\")\nlattice structure. The roof is an arched square supporting a circular dome,\nwhich is topped by a central [obelisk](/wiki/Obelisk \"Obelisk\") with\ndescending [neon](/wiki/Neon_sign \"Neon sign\") block letters spelling\n\"Hollywood\" on each of its four sides.

Never in\nmy wildest dreams did I believe I'd ever see [women of\ncolor](/wiki/Women_of_color \"Women of color\") immortalized in such a creative\nand wonderful fashion.\"[134] Hardwicke contended that critics had missed the\n\"humor and symbolism\" of the structure, which \"embraces and pokes fun at the\nglamour, the polished metallic male form of the [Oscar](/wiki/Academy_Award\n\"Academy Award\"), and the pastiche of styles and dreams that pervades\n[Tinseltown](/wiki/Tinseltown \"Tinseltown\").\"[135]\n\n## Nomination\nprocess[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: Nomination process\")]\n\n[![Director James Cameron squats by his new star, left hand propping up his\nplaque](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/JamesCameronStarDec09.jpg/170px-\nJamesCameronStarDec09.jpg)](/wiki/File:JamesCameronStarDec09.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:JamesCameronStarDec09.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nDirector [James Cameron](/wiki/James_Cameron \"James Cameron\") unveiling his\nstar, 2009\n\nEach year an average of 200 nominations are submitted to the Hollywood Chamber\nof Commerce Walk of Fame selection committee. Anyone, including fans, can\nnominate anyone active in the field of entertainment as long as the nominee or\nhis or her management approves the nomination (a letter of agreement from the\nnominated celebrity or representative must accompany the application).\nNominees must have a minimum of five years' experience in the category for\nwhich they are nominated and a history of \"charitable contributions.\"[74]\nPosthumous nominees must have been deceased at least five years. At a meeting\neach June, the committee selects approximately 20 to 24 celebrities to receive\nstars on the Walk of Fame. One posthumous award is given each year as well.\nThe nominations of those not selected are rolled over to the following year\nfor reconsideration; those not selected two years in a row are dropped, and\nmust be renominated to receive further consideration. Living recipients must\nagree to personally attend a presentation ceremony within two years of\nselection. If the ceremony is not scheduled within two years, a new\napplication must be submitted.
