Unlike a traditional [shopping mall](/wiki/Shopping_mall \"Shopping\nmall\"), all the stores at Wall Drug operate under a single entity instead of\nbeing individually run stores. _[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times\n\"The New York Times\")_ has described Wall Drug as \"a sprawling tourist\nattraction of international renown [that] draws some two million annual\nvisitors to a remote town.\"[1]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Marketing campaign\n  * 3 Today\n    * 3.1 Media references\n  * 4 Gallery\n  * 5 See also\n  * 6 References\n  * 7 External links\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wall_Drug&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/OldWallDrugs.jpg/220px-\nOldWallDrugs.jpg)](/wiki/File:OldWallDrugs.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:OldWallDrugs.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nWall Drug historic display, including items from Hustead's early practice\n\nThe small town drugstore made its first step towards fame when it was\npurchased by Ted Hustead in 1931. Hustead was a Nebraska native and pharmacist\nwho was looking for a small town with a [Catholic\nchurch](/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_the_United_States \"Catholic Church in the\nUnited States\") in which to establish his business. He bought Wall Drug,\nlocated in a 231-person town in what he referred to as \"the middle of\nnowhere,\" and strove to make a living. Business was very slow until his wife,\nDorothy, thought of advertising free ice water to parched travelers heading to\nthe newly opened [Mount Rushmore](/wiki/Mount_Rushmore \"Mount Rushmore\")\nmonument 60 miles (97 km) to the west. From that time on business was brisk.\nWall Drug grew into a [cowboy](/wiki/Cowboy \"Cowboy\")-themed shopping\nmall/[department store](/wiki/Department_store \"Department store\"). Wall Drug\nincludes a western art museum, a chapel based on the one found at [New\nMelleray Abbey](/wiki/New_Melleray_Abbey \"New Melleray Abbey\") near [Dubuque,\nIowa](/wiki/Dubuque,_Iowa \"Dubuque, Iowa\"), and an 80-foot (24 m)\n[apatosaurus](/wiki/Apatosaurus \"Apatosaurus\") (formerly\n[brontosaurus](/wiki/Brontosaurus \"Brontosaurus\")) that can be seen right off\n[Interstate 90](/wiki/Interstate_90 \"Interstate 90\"). It was designed by\n[Emmet Sullivan](/wiki/Emmet_Sullivan \"Emmet Sullivan\") who also created the\ndinosaurs at [Dinosaur Park](/wiki/Dinosaur_Park \"Dinosaur Park\") in [Rapid\nCity](/wiki/Rapid_City,_South_Dakota \"Rapid City, South Dakota\") and [Dinosaur\nWorld](/wiki/Dinosaur_World_\\(Arkansas\\) \"Dinosaur World \\(Arkansas\\)\") in\n[Arkansas](/wiki/Arkansas \"Arkansas\").\n\n## Marketing\ncampaign[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wall_Drug&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Marketing campaign\")]\n\nWall Drug earns much of its fame from its self-promotion.\n[Billboards](/wiki/Billboard_\\(advertising\\) \"Billboard \\(advertising\\)\")\nadvertising the establishment can be seen for hundreds of miles throughout\nSouth Dakota and the neighboring states. In addition, many visitors of Wall\nDrug have erected signs throughout the world announcing the miles to Wall Drug\nfrom famous locations. By 1981 Wall Drug was claiming it was giving away\n20,000 [cups](/wiki/Cup \"Cup\") of water per day during the peak tourist\nseason, lasting from [Memorial Day](/wiki/Memorial_Day \"Memorial Day\") until\n[Labor Day](/wiki/Labor_Day \"Labor Day\"), and during the hottest days of the\n[summer](/wiki/Summer \"Summer\").\n\nMost of Wall Drug's advertisement billboards can be found on an approximately\n650-mile-long (1,050 km) stretch of [Interstate 90](/wiki/Interstate_90\n\"Interstate 90\") from [Minnesota](/wiki/Minnesota \"Minnesota\") to [Billings,\nMontana](/wiki/Billings,_Montana \"Billings, Montana\").

Some popular free bumper stickers read \"Where the heck is\nWall Drug?\", \"How many miles to Wall Drug?\", and \"Where in the world is Wall\nDrug?\".\n\nWhen the [United States Air Force](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force \"United\nStates Air Force\") was still operating [Minuteman\nmissile](/wiki/LGM-30_Minuteman \"LGM-30 Minuteman\") silos in the western South\nDakota plains, Wall Drug used to offer free coffee and doughnuts to service\npersonnel if they stopped in on their way to or from [Ellsworth Air Force\nBase](/wiki/Ellsworth_Air_Force_Base \"Ellsworth Air Force Base\") (50 miles (80\nkm) west on Interstate 90).\n\nTed Hustead died in 1999. The following day, South Dakota Governor [Bill\nJanklow](/wiki/Bill_Janklow \"Bill Janklow\") began his annual [State of the\nState address](/wiki/State_of_the_State_address \"State of the State address\")\nby commemorating Hustead as \"a guy that figured out that free ice water could\nturn you into a phenomenal success in the middle of a semi-arid desert way out\nin the middle of someplace.\"[1]\n\n### Media references[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wall_Drug&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Media references\")]\n\nIn 1981, Wall Drug was featured in [_Time_ magazine](/wiki/Time_\\(magazine\\)\n\"Time \\(magazine\\)\") as one of the largest tourist attractions in the\nnorth.[3] In his 1989 book _[The Lost\nContinent](/wiki/The_Lost_Continent:_Travels_in_Small-Town_America \"The Lost\nContinent: Travels in Small-Town America\")_ , [Bill Bryson](/wiki/Bill_Bryson\n\"Bill Bryson\") wrote, \"It's an awful place, one of the world's worst [tourist\ntraps](/wiki/Tourist_trap \"Tourist trap\"), but I loved it and I won't have a\nword said against it.\"[4] The history of Wall Drug was told in a two-episode\nstory arc of the podcast _[The Radio Adventures of Dr.\nFloyd](/wiki/The_Radio_Adventures_of_Dr._Floyd \"The Radio Adventures of Dr.\nFloyd\")_.
