[e](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Culture_of_the_United_States&action=edit)\n\n  \n  \nThe **history of the United States** began with the\n[settlement](/wiki/Prehistoric_migration_and_settlement_of_the_Americas_from_Asia\n\"Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia\") of\n[Indigenous people](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native\nAmericans in the United States\") before 10,000 BC. [Numerous\ncultures](/wiki/Native_American_cultures_in_the_United_States \"Native American\ncultures in the United States\") formed. The [arrival of Christopher\nColumbus](/wiki/Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus \"Voyages of Christopher\nColumbus\") in 1492 started the [European colonization of the\nAmericas](/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas \"European colonization\nof the Americas\"). Most colonies formed after 1600. By the 1770s, [thirteen\nBritish colonies](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies \"Thirteen Colonies\") contained 2.5\nmillion people along the [Atlantic\ncoast](/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States \"East Coast of the United\nStates\") east of the [Appalachian Mountains](/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains\n\"Appalachian Mountains\"). After [defeating\nFrance](/wiki/French_and_Indian_Wars \"French and Indian Wars\"), the British\ngovernment imposed a series of new taxes after 1765, rejecting the colonists'\nargument that new taxes needed their approval (see [Stamp Act\n1765](/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765 \"Stamp Act 1765\")). Tax resistance, especially the\n[Boston Tea Party](/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party \"Boston Tea Party\") (1773), led to\n[punitive laws](/wiki/Intolerable_Acts \"Intolerable Acts\") by Parliament\ndesigned to end self-government in Massachusetts.\n\nArmed conflict began in 1775. In 1776, the [Second Continental\nCongress](/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress \"Second Continental Congress\")\ndeclared a new, independent nation: the [United States of\nAmerica](/wiki/United_States_of_America \"United States of America\"). Led by\nGeneral [George Washington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\"), it\nwon the [Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American\nRevolutionary War\") with large support from France. The [peace treaty of\n1783](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\\(1783\\) \"Treaty of Paris \\(1783\\)\") gave the new\nnation the land east of the Mississippi River (except [Canada](/wiki/Canada\n\"Canada\") and [Florida](/wiki/Florida \"Florida\")). The [Articles of\nConfederation](/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation \"Articles of Confederation\")\nestablished a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing\nstability, as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A\n[convention](/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_\\(United_States\\) \"Constitutional\nConvention \\(United States\\)\") in 1787 wrote [a new\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\")\nthat was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a [Bill of\nRights](/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights \"United States Bill of Rights\") was\nadded to guarantee [inalienable rights](/wiki/Inalienable_rights \"Inalienable\nrights\"). With Washington as the first president and [Alexander\nHamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\") his chief adviser, a\nstrong central government was created. [Purchase](/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase\n\"Louisiana Purchase\") of the [Louisiana Territory](/wiki/Louisiana_Territory\n\"Louisiana Territory\") from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United\nStates. A second and final war with Britain was [fought in\n1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\"), which solidified national pride.\n\nEncouraged by the notion of [manifest destiny](/wiki/Manifest_destiny\n\"Manifest destiny\"), U.S. territory expanded all the way to the [Pacific\ncoast](/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States \"West Coast of the United\nStates\"). While the United States was large in terms of area, [its\npopulation](/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States \"Demography of the United\nStates\") in 1790 was only 4 million. However this grew rapidly, reaching 7.2\nmillion in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940,\nand 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall [GDP](/wiki/GDP\n\"GDP\") was even greater. However compared to European powers, the nation's\nmilitary strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. The\nexpansion was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for [yeoman](/wiki/Yeoman\n\"Yeoman\") farmers and slave owners. The expansion of\n[slavery](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States \"Slavery in the United States\")\nwas increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional\nbattles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all\nstates [north](/wiki/Northern_United_States \"Northern United States\") of the\n[Mason–Dixon line](/wiki/Mason%E2%80%93Dixon_line \"Mason–Dixon line\") by 1804,\nbut the [South](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\")\ncontinued to profit off of the institution, mostly from [production of\ncotton](/wiki/Cotton_production_in_the_United_States \"Cotton production in the\nUnited States\"). [Republican](/wiki/Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Republican Party \\(United States\\)\") [Abraham Lincoln](/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\n\"Abraham Lincoln\") was [elected in\n1860](/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1860 \"United States\npresidential election, 1860\") on a platform of halting the expansion of\nslavery.\n\nSeven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the\n[Confederacy](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of\nAmerica\"). Its [attack of Fort Sumter](/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sumter \"Battle of\nFort Sumter\") against the [Union forces](/wiki/Union_\\(American_Civil_War\\)\n\"Union \\(American Civil War\\)\") started the [Civil\nWar](/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") (1861–1865). Confederate\ndefeat led to the impoverishment of the South and the abolition of slavery. In\nthe [Reconstruction Era](/wiki/Reconstruction_Era \"Reconstruction Era\")\n(1863–1877), legal and voting rights were extended to [freed\nslaves](/wiki/Freedmen \"Freedmen\"). The national government emerged much\nstronger, and because of the [Fourteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") in 1868, it gained\nthe explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white\n[Democrats](/wiki/Democratic_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"Democratic Party\n\\(United States\\)\") regained their power in the South in 1877, often by\n[paramilitary](/wiki/Paramilitary \"Paramilitary\") suppression of voting, they\npassed [Jim Crow laws](/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws \"Jim Crow laws\") to maintain [white\nsupremacy](/wiki/White_supremacy \"White supremacy\"), and new\n[disfranchising](/wiki/Disenfranchisement_after_the_Reconstruction_Era\n\"Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era\") constitutions that\nprevented most [African Americans](/wiki/African_Americans \"African\nAmericans\") and many poor whites from voting. This continued until gains of\nthe [Civil Rights Movement](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement \"Civil Rights\nMovement\") in the 1960s and passage of federal legislation to enforce\nconstitutional rights were made.\n\nThe United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of\nthe 20th century due to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the\n[Northeast](/wiki/Northeastern_United_States \"Northeastern United States\") and\n[Midwest](/wiki/Midwestern_United_States \"Midwestern United States\") and the\narrival of millions of immigrant workers and farmers from\n[Europe](/wiki/Europe \"Europe\"). The national railroad network was completed\nand large-scale mining and factories industrialized the Northeast and Midwest.\nMass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency and traditional politics\nstimulated the [Progressive movement](/wiki/Progressive_Era \"Progressive\nEra\"), from the 1890s to 1920s, which led to many reforms including the 16th\nto 19th constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax,\ndirect election of Senators,\n[prohibition](/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States \"Prohibition in the\nUnited States\"), and [women's\nsuffrage](/wiki/Women%27s_Suffrage_in_the_United_States \"Women's Suffrage in\nthe United States\"). Initially neutral during [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I\n\"World War I\"), the United States [declared war on\nGermany](/wiki/American_entry_into_World_War_I \"American entry into World War\nI\") in 1917 and funded the Allied victory the following year.\n\nAfter [a prosperous decade](/wiki/Roaring_Twenties \"Roaring Twenties\") in the\n1920s, the [Wall Street Crash of 1929](/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929 \"Wall\nStreet Crash of 1929\") marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States \"Great Depression in\nthe United States\"). Democratic President [Franklin D.\nRoosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\") ended the\nRepublican dominance of the [White House](/wiki/White_House \"White House\") and\nimplemented his [New Deal](/wiki/New_Deal \"New Deal\") programs, which included\nrelief for the unemployed, support for farmers, [Social\nSecurity](/wiki/Social_Security_\\(United_States\\) \"Social Security \\(United\nStates\\)\") and a [minimum wage](/wiki/Minimum_wage \"Minimum wage\"). The New\nDeal defined [modern American liberalism](/wiki/Modern_American_liberalism\n\"Modern American liberalism\"). After the [Japanese attack on Pearl\nHarbor](/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor \"Attack on Pearl Harbor\") in 1941, the\nUnited States entered [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") and\nfinanced the [Allied](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II \"Allies of World War II\")\nwar effort and helped defeat [Nazi Germany](/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi Germany\")\nin the [European theater](/wiki/European_Theatre_of_World_War_II \"European\nTheatre of World War II\"). Its involvement culminated in using newly invented\n[nuclear weapons on two Japanese\ncities](/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki \"Atomic bombings of\nHiroshima and Nagasaki\") to defeat [Imperial Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan\n\"Empire of Japan\") in the [Pacific theater](/wiki/Pacific_War \"Pacific War\").\n\nThe United States and the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\")\nemerged as rival superpowers in the [aftermath of World War\nII](/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_II \"Aftermath of World War II\"). During the\n[Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\"), the two countries confronted each other\nindirectly in the [arms race](/wiki/Arms_race \"Arms race\"), the [Space\nRace](/wiki/Space_Race \"Space Race\"), [proxy wars](/wiki/Proxy_war \"Proxy\nwar\"), and propaganda campaigns. The purpose of this was to stop the spread of\ncommunism. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the Civil Rights\nMovement, another wave of social reforms was enacted by enforcing the\nconstitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African-Americans\nand other racial minorities.

People did not live there year-round, but for the\nsummer to hunt and fish, and to gather food supplies for the winter.[7] The\n[Oshara Tradition](/wiki/Oshara_Tradition \"Oshara Tradition\") people lived\nfrom 5500 BCE to 600 CE.

The prime example is [Watson\nBrake](/wiki/Watson_Brake \"Watson Brake\") in northern Louisiana, whose\n11-mound complex is dated to 3500 BCE, making it the oldest, dated site in the\nAmericas for such complex construction. It is nearly 2,000 years older than\nthe [Poverty Point](/wiki/Poverty_Point \"Poverty Point\") site.

It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies.[19][20][21]\n    * Leadership was restricted to a group of 50 [sachem](/wiki/Sachem \"Sachem\") [chiefs](/wiki/Tribal_chief \"Tribal chief\"), each representing one [clan](/wiki/Clan \"Clan\") within a tribe. The [Oneida](/wiki/Oneida_people \"Oneida people\") and [Mohawk people](/wiki/Mohawk_people \"Mohawk people\") had nine seats each; the [Onondagas](/wiki/Onondaga_people \"Onondaga people\") held fourteen; the [Cayuga](/wiki/Cayuga_nation \"Cayuga nation\") had ten seats; and the [Seneca](/wiki/Seneca_nation \"Seneca nation\") had eight. Representation was not based on population numbers, as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others. When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed [matrilineally](/wiki/Matrilineality \"Matrilineality\"). Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical [veto power](/wiki/Veto \"Veto\"). The Onondaga were the \"[firekeepers](/wiki/Firekeeper \"Firekeeper\")\", responsible for raising topics to be discussed. They occupied one side of a three-sided fire (the Mohawk and Seneca sat on one side of the fire, the Oneida and Cayuga sat on the third side.)[21]\n    * Elizabeth Tooker, an [anthropologist](/wiki/Anthropologist \"Anthropologist\"), has said that it was unlikely theU.S.founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.[21]\n    * Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th century, or in the 17th century [Beaver Wars](/wiki/Beaver_Wars \"Beaver Wars\").[22]\n  * Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the [Osage](/wiki/Osage_Nation \"Osage Nation\"), [Kaw](/wiki/Kaw_people \"Kaw people\"), [Ponca](/wiki/Ponca \"Ponca\") and [Omaha people](/wiki/Omaha_people \"Omaha people\").

Many royal\nofficials and merchants were Anglicans.[40]\n\nReligiosity expanded greatly after the [First Great\nAwakening](/wiki/First_Great_Awakening \"First Great Awakening\"), a religious\nrevival in the 1740s led by preachers such as [Jonathan\nEdwards](/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_\\(theologian\\) \"Jonathan Edwards\n\\(theologian\\)\") and [George Whitefield](/wiki/George_Whitefield \"George\nWhitefield\").

Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London\nwho controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected\nlegislature to vote taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American\ncolonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with\nample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of\nBritain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who\narrived as indentured servants.[42]\n\nThe tobacco and rice plantations imported African\n[slaves](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States \"Slavery in the United States\")\nfor labor from the British colonies in the West Indies, and by the 1770s\nAfrican slaves comprised a fifth of the American population. The question of\nindependence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British\nmilitary support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were\ngone by 1765. London regarded the American colonies as existing for the\nbenefit of the mother country.

The other colonies\nwere more equalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the\nmid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited\ndeference to its small upper-class.

America thus became a member of the international community, which meant becoming a maker of treaties and alliances, a military ally in diplomacy, and a partner in foreign trade on a more equal basis.[52]\n\nThe new nation was founded on [Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment \"Age\nof Enlightenment\") ideals of liberalism in what [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") called the unalienable\nrights to \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\", and dedicated strongly\nto [republican](/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States \"Republicanism in the\nUnited States\") principles.

(The Catholic, Episcopal and Lutheran\ndenominations largely ignored the slavery issue.)[102]\n\nThe issue of slavery in the new territories was seemingly settled by the\n[Compromise of 1850](/wiki/Compromise_of_1850 \"Compromise of 1850\"), brokered\nby Whig [Henry Clay](/wiki/Henry_Clay \"Henry Clay\") and Democrat [Stephen\nDouglas](/wiki/Stephen_Douglas \"Stephen Douglas\"); the Compromise included the\nadmission of California as a [free state](/wiki/Free_state_\\(United_States\\)\n\"Free state \\(United States\\)\") in exchange for no federal restrictions on\nslavery placed on Utah or New Mexico.[103] The point of contention was the\n[Fugitive Slave Act](/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act \"Fugitive Slave Act\"), which\nincreased federal enforcement and required even free states to cooperate in\nturning over fugitive slaves to their owners. Abolitionists pounced on the Act\nto attack slavery, as in the best-selling anti-slavery [novel](/wiki/Novel\n\"Novel\") _[Uncle Tom's Cabin](/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\")_\nby [Harriet Beecher Stowe](/wiki/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe \"Harriet Beecher\nStowe\").[104]\n\nThe [Compromise of 1820](/wiki/Compromise_of_1820 \"Compromise of 1820\") was\nrepealed in 1854 with the [Kansas–Nebraska\nAct](/wiki/Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska_Act \"Kansas–Nebraska Act\"), promoted by\nSenator Douglas in the name of \"[popular\nsovereignty](/wiki/Popular_sovereignty_in_the_United_States \"Popular\nsovereignty in the United States\")\" and democracy. It permitted voters to\ndecide on the legality slavery in each territory, and allowed Douglas to adopt\nneutrality on the issue of slavery. Anti-slavery forces rose in anger and\nalarm, forming the new [Republican\nParty](/wiki/History_of_the_Republican_Party_\\(United_States\\) \"History of the\nRepublican Party \\(United States\\)\"). Pro- and anti- contingents rushed to\nKansas to vote slavery up or down, resulting in a miniature civil war called\n[Bleeding Kansas](/wiki/Bleeding_Kansas \"Bleeding Kansas\"). By the late 1850s,\nthe young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the\nelectoral college. It insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand\n(and thus would slowly die out).[105]\n\nThe Southern slavery-based societies had become wealthy based on their\n[cotton](/wiki/Cotton \"Cotton\") and other agricultural\n[commodity](/wiki/Commodity \"Commodity\") production, and some particularly\nprofited from the internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New\nYork, and regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking,\nshipping, and manufacturing, including [textile mills](/wiki/Textile_mills\n\"Textile mills\"). By 1860, there were four million slaves in [the\nSouth](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\"), nearly eight\ntimes as many as there were nationwide in 1790. The\n[plantations](/wiki/Plantations_in_the_American_South \"Plantations in the\nAmerican South\") were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for\nraw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing\nmore slaves (largely drawn from the declining [tobacco](/wiki/Tobacco\n\"Tobacco\") regions).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/National-\natlas-1970-1860.png/300px-National-atlas-1970-1860.png)](/wiki/File:National-\natlas-1970-1860.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:National-atlas-1970-1860.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe United States, immediately before the Civil War.

The Fugitive Slave\nAct of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting\nto recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped\nslave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary\nand freedom under the [Missouri Compromise](/wiki/Missouri_Compromise\n\"Missouri Compromise\"). The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in _[Dred Scott v.\nSandford](/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford \"Dred Scott v.

It attacked [Fort\nSumter](/wiki/Fort_Sumter \"Fort Sumter\"), a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina,\nthus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the\nConfederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the\nConfederacy.

The two armies had their first major clash at the [First\nBattle of Bull Run](/wiki/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run \"First Battle of Bull Run\")\n(Battle of Manassas), ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved\nto both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and\nbloodier than originally anticipated.[108]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg/250px-\nPinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg)](/wiki/File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nLincoln with [Allan Pinkerton](/wiki/Allan_Pinkerton \"Allan Pinkerton\") and\nMajor General [John Alexander McClernand](/wiki/John_Alexander_McClernand\n\"John Alexander McClernand\") at the [Battle of\nAntietam](/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam \"Battle of Antietam\").\n\nThe war soon divided into two theaters:\n[Eastern](/wiki/Eastern_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Eastern Theater of\nthe American Civil War\") and\n[Western](/wiki/Western_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Western Theater of\nthe American Civil War\").

Major General\n[George B. McClellan](/wiki/George_B._McClellan \"George B. McClellan\") was put\nin charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new [Army of the\nPotomac](/wiki/Army_of_the_Potomac \"Army of the Potomac\"), McClellan failed to\ncapture the Confederate capital of [Richmond,\nVirginia](/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia \"Richmond, Virginia\") in his [Peninsula\nCampaign](/wiki/Peninsula_Campaign \"Peninsula Campaign\") and [retreated after\nattacks](/wiki/Seven_Days_Battle \"Seven Days Battle\") from newly appointed\nConfederate General [Robert E. Lee](/wiki/Robert_E._Lee \"Robert E. Lee\").[110]\nMeanwhile, both sides concentrated in 1861–62 on raising and training new\narmies. The main action was Union success in controlling the border states,\nwith Confederates largely driven out of Maryland, West Virginia (a new state),\nKentucky and Missouri. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland was\ndesigned to hurt Union morale and win European support. It ended with\nConfederate retreat at the [Battle of Antietam](/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam\n\"Battle of Antietam\"), and Lincoln's warning he would issue an Emancipation\nProclamation in January 1863 if the states did not return. Making slavery a\ncentral war goal Energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies,\nthe anti-war Copperhead Democrats. It ended the risk of British and French\nintervention.\n\nLee's smaller army won at the [Battle of\nFredericksburg](/wiki/Battle_of_Fredericksburg \"Battle of Fredericksburg\")\nlate in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the\n[Battle of Chancellorsville](/wiki/Battle_of_Chancellorsville \"Battle of\nChancellorsville\") in May 1863, while losing his top aide, [Stonewall\nJackson](/wiki/Stonewall_Jackson \"Stonewall Jackson\"). But Lee pushed too hard\nand ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search\nof supplies and to cause [war-weariness](/wiki/War-weariness \"War-weariness\")\nin the North. In perhaps the [turning point of the\nwar](/wiki/Turning_point_of_the_American_Civil_War \"Turning point of the\nAmerican Civil War\"), Lee's army was badly beaten at the [Battle of\nGettysburg](/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg \"Battle of Gettysburg\"), July 1–3,\n1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.[111] On the homefront, industrial\nexpansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad\nservice, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories. Foreign trade\nincreased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain,\nAnd Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for\nthe Union Army (plus a few to the Confederates). The British operated blockade\nrunners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy,\nbringing out tobacco and cotton.

Grant](/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant \"Ulysses S.

Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies.\nGrant put General William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the Western armies. In\n1864, Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive\nvictory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North who feared they\nmight fail to reelect Lincoln in 1864. Lincoln won a landslide. The last two\nyears of the war were bloody for both sides, With Sherman marching almost\nunopposed through central and eastern Georgia, then moving up through South\nCarolina and North Carolina, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining\nrailroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties. Sherman demonstrated\nthat the South line the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion. Much\nof the heartland of the Confederacy was physically destroyed, and could no\nlonger provide desperately needed food, horses, mules, wagons, boots or\nmunitions to its combat armies. In spring 1864 Grant, realizing that Lee was\nunable to replenishes casualties, while Lincoln would provide replacements for\nUnion losses, launched a [war of attrition](/wiki/Attrition_warfare \"Attrition\nwarfare\") against Lee's [Army of Northern\nVirginia](/wiki/Army_of_Northern_Virginia \"Army of Northern Virginia\"). This\nwar of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these,\nthe [Overland Campaign](/wiki/Overland_Campaign \"Overland Campaign\") forced\nLee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second\nmajor offensive, the [Richmond-Petersburg Campaign](/wiki/Richmond-\nPetersburg_Campaign \"Richmond-Petersburg Campaign\") in which he [besieged\nPetersburg](/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg \"Siege of Petersburg\"). After a near\nten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the [defense of Fort\nGregg](/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Petersburg \"Third Battle of Petersburg\") allowed\nLee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final,\n[Appomattox Campaign](/wiki/Appomattox_Campaign \"Appomattox Campaign\") which\nresulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia numbering 28,000 on\nApril 9, 1865, at [Appomattox Court\nHouse](/wiki/Appomattox_Court_House_National_Historical_Park \"Appomattox Court\nHouse National Historical Park\"). Other Confederate armies followed suit and\nthe war ended with no postwar insurgency.\n\nThe American Civil War was the world's earliest [industrial\nwar](/wiki/Industrial_warfare \"Industrial warfare\"). Railroads, the telegraph,\nsteamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The\nmobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation\nand food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in [World\nWar I](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\"). It remains the deadliest war in\nAmerican history, resulting in the deaths of about 750,000 soldiers and an\nundetermined number of [civilian casualties](/wiki/Civilian_casualties\n\"Civilian casualties\").[112] About ten percent of all Northern males 20–45\nyears old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 died.[113]\nIts legacy includes ending slavery in the United States, restoring the Union,\nand strengthening the role of the federal government.\n\nAccording to historian [Allan Nevins](/wiki/Allan_Nevins \"Allan Nevins\") the\nCivil War had a major long-term impact on the United States in terms of\ndeveloping its leadership potential and moving the entire nation beyond the\nadolescent stage:\n\n    The fighting and its attendant demands upon industry, finance, medicine, and law also helped train a host of leaders who during the next 35 years, to 1900, made their influence powerfully felt on most of the social, economic, and cultural fronts. It broke down barriers of parochialism; it ended distrust of large-scale effort; it hardened and matured the whole people emotionally. The adolescent land of the 1850s…rose under the blows of battle to adult estate.

From\n1880 to 1914, peak years of immigration, more than 22 million people migrated\nto the United States.[133] Most were unskilled workers who quickly found jobs\nin mines, mills, factories.

The overall result was a dramatic increase\nin GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to\nAmerican forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian\nconsumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort.
