Unlike its predecessor, the game does not include [time\ntravel](/wiki/Time_travel \"Time travel\"). Instead, _Before the Storm_ features\nthe ability \"Backtalk\", with which the player can call upon Chloe to get out\nof certain precarious situations; \"Backtalk\" may also make a situation worse.\nA [dialogue tree](/wiki/Dialog_tree \"Dialog tree\") is used when a conversation\nor commentary is prompted.

Conflict arises with two men inside, whom she\nevades when schoolmate Rachel Amber causes a distraction. The next day, Chloe\nand Rachel reunite at Blackwell Academy and decide to ditch class, stowing\naway on a cargo train and ending up at a [lookout\npoint](/wiki/Scenic_viewpoint \"Scenic viewpoint\"). They people-watch through a\nviewfinder and see a man and woman kiss in the park, which upsets Rachel. They\nsteal wine from local campers and take a walk to a scrapyard. Chloe confronts\nRachel about her change in mood, but is refused an answer. After Rachel\nleaves, Chloe discovers the wrecked car in which her father was killed. She\nmeets up with Rachel again, who discloses that she witnessed her father,\nJames, cheating on her mother through the viewfinder. Rachel destroys a family\nphoto in a burning trash bin, and in a fit of rage kicks it over, igniting a\n[wildfire](/wiki/Wildfire \"Wildfire\").[4]\n\nThe next day, Chloe and Rachel are reprimanded by Principal Wells for ditching\nschool. Chloe hides out at the scrapyard where she finds an old truck in need\nof repairing. She then receives a call from local drug dealer Frank Bowers,\nwho arranges a meeting to discuss settling her debt with him. Chloe agrees to\nrepay him by helping him steal money from her classmate Drew, who owes Frank a\nlarge sum. However, Chloe finds out that Drew is being violently extorted by\nanother drug dealer, Damon Merrick, and she must decide whether to pay off the\ndealer with the stolen money to protect Drew or keep it. When later a student\nis unable to participate in the school's theater production of _[The\nTempest](/wiki/The_Tempest \"The Tempest\")_ due to road closures from the\nwildfire, Chloe reluctantly takes on the role opposite Rachel. After the play,\nthey decide to leave Arcadia Bay with the newly repaired truck and return to\nRachel's house to pack. There, following a confrontation, James reveals that\nthe woman they saw him kissing was not a mistress, but in fact Rachel's\nbiological mother.[5]\n\nRachel is told that her mother, Sera, is a drug addict, and that on the day\nher father kissed her, he had rejected Sera's plea to see Rachel. Chloe vows\nto find Rachel's mother, against James' wishes. Chloe contacts Frank, who\nagrees to meet her at the scrapyard. She repairs the truck there before Rachel\narrives. They are ambushed by Frank and Damon, who stabs Rachel after he\nrealises she is the district attorney's daughter. Surviving the wound, Rachel\nrecovers at the hospital. Chloe continues the search by investigating James'\noffice for clues about Sera, instead revealing that James has been in contact\nwith Damon; Chloe uses James' phone to convince Damon to disclose where Sera\nis located, and finds out that Damon has kidnapped her for ransom. She races\nto Damon to pay him off, but learns when she reaches him that James wanted him\nto kill Sera. Frank appears and fights Damon, after which Sera entreats that\nChloe never tell Rachel about James' actions. Back at the hospital, Chloe is\nfaced with a choice: tell Rachel everything or protect her from the truth.[6]\n\n##\nDevelopment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Life_Is_Strange:_Before_the_Storm&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Development\")]\n\nPublisher [Square Enix](/wiki/Square_Enix \"Square Enix\") chose [Deck\nNine](/wiki/Deck_Nine \"Deck Nine\") to develop the prequel to _Life Is Strange_\nafter the developer's proprietary StoryForge tools had made an impression.[7]\nDevelopment started in 2016 with the [Unity](/wiki/Unity_\\(game_engine\\)\n\"Unity \\(game engine\\)\") game engine. Rhianna DeVries, who initially did the\ngame's [motion capture](/wiki/Motion_capture \"Motion capture\") for Chloe\nPrice, voices the character, while the original voice actress [Ashly\nBurch](/wiki/Ashly_Burch \"Ashly Burch\") serves as writing consultant.[2][8][9]\nBurch did not reprise her role due to the [SAG-AFTRA\nstrike](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_video_game_voice_actor_strike \"2016–17 video\ngame voice actor strike\").[10] With the strike over, Burch and Hannah Telle,\nwho voiced Max Caulfield in _Life Is Strange_ , will return for a bonus\nepisode.[11] The game went under different [working\ntitles](/wiki/Working_title \"Working title\") during casting,[12] according to\nKylie Brown, who was cast as Rachel Amber (then codenamed Rebecca) in February\n2017.[13] The music was written and performed by the British [indie\nfolk](/wiki/Indie_folk \"Indie folk\") band [Daughter](/wiki/Daughter_\\(band\\)\n\"Daughter \\(band\\)\"), and released as an official soundtrack by [Glassnote\nRecords](/wiki/Glassnote_Records \"Glassnote Records\") on 1 September 2017.[14]\nInstrumentation was employed to represent different sides of the lead\ncharacter: [piano](/wiki/Piano \"Piano\") for isolation, [electric\nguitar](/wiki/Electric_guitar \"Electric guitar\") for rebelliousness, and\nlayered [vocals](/wiki/Vocals \"Vocals\") for friendship.[15] Daughter took the\nscript and concept artwork as inspiration.[16] The writers researched memoirs\nand psychology to understand the grieving process of the main character.[17]\n\n##\nRelease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Life_Is_Strange:_Before_the_Storm&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Release\")]\n\nPrior to its official announcement, images had leaked online indicating that a\nprequel to _Life Is Strange_ was in development.[18] Square Enix revealed\n_Life Is Strange: Before the Storm_ on 11 June during [E3 2017](/wiki/E3_2017\n\"E3 2017\"), stating that it would be released over three chapters starting on\n31 August for [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft\nWindows\"), [PlayStation 4](/wiki/PlayStation_4 \"PlayStation 4\") and [Xbox\nOne](/wiki/Xbox_One \"Xbox One\").[2] The Deluxe Edition includes the bonus\nchapter \"Farewell\"—featuring Max Caulfield of the original game as a playable\ncharacter—three additional outfits, and Mixtape Mode, allowing players to\ncustomise playlists with the game's soundtrack.[3]\n\nEpisode | Release date  \n---|---  \n\"Episode 1: Awake\"[19] | 31 August 2017  \n\"Episode 2: Brave New World\"[20] | 19 October 2017[21]  \n\"Episode 3: Hell Is Empty\"[20] | 20 December 2017[22]  \n  \n##\nReception[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Life_Is_Strange:_Before_the_Storm&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Reception\")]\n\nAggregate review scores Game | [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\")  \n---|---  \n_Episode 1: Awake_ | (PC) 77/100[23]  \n(PS4) 78/100[24]  \n(XONE) 80/100[25]  \n_Episode 2: Brave New World_ | (PC) 78/100[26]  \n(PS4) 79/100[27]  \n(XONE) 76/100[28]  \n  \nCritics appraised _Episode 1: Awake_ the most on its character development of\nChloe Price and Rachel Amber.[29][30][31][32] Jeremy Peeples of [Hardcore\nGamer](/wiki/Hardcore_Gamer \"Hardcore Gamer\") found Chloe's behaviour\n\"endearing\" and noted that her personality was portrayed with multiple layers.\nSam Loveridge at [GamesRadar](/wiki/GamesRadar \"GamesRadar\") wrote that Rachel\nwas the more authentic character on account of her more \"grounded\" dialogue.\nDespite disparaging Chloe for being \"her same tiresomely combative self\" early\non, _[Metro](/wiki/Metro_\\(British_newspaper\\) \"Metro \\(British newspaper\\)\")_\nsaw her fleshed out by enduring the loss of her father. _[Game\nInformer](/wiki/Game_Informer \"Game Informer\")_ 's Kimberley Wallace thought\nthe younger version of Chloe brought a \"naivety and vulnerability\" worthy of\nsympathy. Conversely, the relationship between the leads was said to have\nformed \"at unnatural speed\". Peeples and Loveridge favoured the \"Backtalk\"\ngameplay feature, while _Metro_ and Wallace cared little for it. Otherwise\nlauded were the story, graphics, voice acting, and soundtrack.[33][34][35][36]\n\nReviewers found _Episode 2: Brave New World_ to either be better than the\nfirst installment or one of the series' greatest.[37][38] _Metro_ praised how\nchoices made a difference with a \"profound effect\" on character arc, while\nOzzie Mejia of [Shacknews](/wiki/Shacknews \"Shacknews\") relished in Chloe's\n\"genuine growth\" contrasting her \"fiery spirit\". Similarly, _Game Informer_ 's\nJoe Juba appreciated the continued comprehension of the character, declaring\nthis \"its biggest strength\". However, Juba's biggest complaint echoed that of\nWallace, in reference to the \"forced\" manner with which Chloe and Rachel are\nmade friends. Brett Makedonski, writing for [Destructoid](/wiki/Destructoid\n\"Destructoid\"), thought that the character exposition was done \"to great\neffect\". Most noted was _The Tempest_ school play sequence, which _Metro_\nstated as their favorite; Mejia called \"one of the funniest\" in _Before the\nStorm_ ; and Juba observed as the culmination of all past choices. _Metro_\ncriticized the script for being \"uneven\" and disapproved of the voice acting.\nMejia felt the ending could have been done away with, saying it was \"a bit\ndrawn out\", though he was impressed with the progression of the Backtalk\nfeature.[37][38][39][40]\n\n###\nAwards[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Life_Is_Strange:_Before_the_Storm&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Awards\")]\n\nFollowing E3 2017, _Life Is Strange: Before the Storm_ received one of\nGamesRadar's Best of E3 awards[41] and was nominated for Hardcore Gamer's\nAdventure Game award.[42] It was nominated in the Games for Impact category at\n[The Game Awards 2017](/wiki/The_Game_Awards_2017 \"The Game Awards 2017\").[43]\nAt the 2017 [Golden Joystick Awards](/wiki/Golden_Joystick_Awards \"Golden\nJoystick Awards\"), it was nominated for Best Audio.[44]\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Life_Is_Strange:_Before_the_Storm&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Additional work by Square Enix London Studios[1]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Life_Is_Strange:_Before_the_Storm&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Robertson, John (12 July 2017).
