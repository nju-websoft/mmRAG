To score a field goal\nthe team in possession of the ball must place kick, or drop kick, the ball\nthrough the goal, i.e., between the uprights and over the crossbar. American\nfootball requires that a field goal must only come during a [play from\nscrimmage](/wiki/Play_from_scrimmage \"Play from scrimmage\"), while Canadian\nfootball retains open field kicks and thus field goals may be scored at any\ntime from anywhere on the field and by any player. The vast majority of field\ngoals, in both codes, are placed kicked. [Drop\nkicked](/wiki/Drop_kick#American_and_Canadian_football \"Drop kick\") field\ngoals were common in the early days of Gridiron football but are almost never\ndone in modern times. In most leagues, a successful field goal awards three\npoints (a notable exception is in [six-man football](/wiki/Six-man_football\n\"Six-man football\") where, due to the difficulty of making a successful field\ngoal because of the small number of players available to stop the opposing\nteam from attempting a block, a field goal is worth four points).\n\nA field goal may also be scored through a [fair catch\nkick](/wiki/Fair_catch_kick \"Fair catch kick\"), but this is extremely rare.\nSince a field goal is worth only three points, as opposed to a\n[touchdown](/wiki/Touchdown \"Touchdown\"), which is worth six points, it is\nusually only attempted in specific situations (see Strategy).\n\nThe goal structure consists of a horizontal crossbar suspended 10 feet (3.0 m)\nabove the ground, with two vertical goalposts 18 feet 6 inches (5.64 m) apart\nextending vertically from each end of the crossbar.[1] In American football\nthe goals are centered on each end line; in Canadian football the goals are\ncentered on each goal line.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Strategy\n  * 2 How field goals are kicked\n  * 3 Successful field goals\n  * 4 Missed field goals\n  * 5 Blocked field goals\n  * 6 History\n  * 7 Longest field goal records\n    * 7.1 NFL\n    * 7.2 CFL\n    * 7.3 College football\n    * 7.4 U Sports\n    * 7.5 High school\n    * 7.6 Independent amateur\n    * 7.7 Independent Women's Football League\n  * 8 Longest missed field goal return records\n    * 8.1 NFL\n    * 8.2 CFL\n    * 8.3 NCAA\n    * 8.4 U Sports\n  * 9 References\n  * 10 External links\n\n## Strategy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Field_goal&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit\nsection: Strategy\")]\n\nAs a field goal is worth only three points, while a touchdown scores at least\nsix (which usually becomes seven with a successful\n[conversion](/wiki/Conversion_\\(gridiron_football\\) \"Conversion \\(gridiron\nfootball\\)\"), and potentially 8 with a [two-point conversion](/wiki/Two-\npoint_conversion \"Two-point conversion\")), teams will generally attempt a\nfield goal only in the following situations:\n\n  * It is fourth down (third down in Canadian rules), especially if the offense is more than a yard or two from a new first down, and within about 45 yards of the goal posts.\n  * In the first half, there is enough time remaining to execute only one more play.\n  * In the second half, there is enough time remaining to execute only one more play, and the team on offense needs three points to win or tie (four points in a few leagues given special circumstances).\n  * The game is in [overtime](/wiki/Overtime_\\(sport\\) \"Overtime \\(sport\\)\"), and a FG is the quickest, easiest, and least risky way to end the match.\n\nExcept in desperate situations, a team will generally attempt field goals only\nwhen keeping a drive alive is unlikely, and its [kicker](/wiki/Placekicker\n\"Placekicker\") has a significant chance of success, as a missed field goal\nresults in a turnover at the spot of the kick (in the NFL) or at the line of\nscrimmage (in the NCAA). In American high school rules and Canadian football,\nwhere a missed field goal is treated the same as a punt, most teams still opt\nnot to attempt field goals from very long range since field goal formations\nare not conducive to covering kick returns. Even under ideal conditions, the\nbest professional kickers historically had difficulty making kicks longer than\n50 yards consistently (the NFL record is 64 yards and the CFL record, 62\nyards).[2] If a team chooses not to attempt a field goal on their last down,\nthey can [punt](/wiki/Punt_\\(gridiron_football\\) \"Punt \\(gridiron football\\)\")\nto the other team. A punt cannot score any points in American football unless\nthe receiving team touches the ball first and the kicking team recovers it\n(though it can result in a [single](/wiki/Single_\\(football\\) \"Single\n\\(football\\)\") in Canadian football), but it may push the other team back\ntoward its own end.\n\nThe longest field goal kick in NFL history is 64 yards, a record set by [Matt\nPrater](/wiki/Matt_Prater \"Matt Prater\") on December 8, 2013. The previous\nrecord was 63, originally set by [Tom Dempsey](/wiki/Tom_Dempsey \"Tom\nDempsey\") and then matched by [Jason Elam](/wiki/Jason_Elam \"Jason Elam\"),\n[Sebastian Janikowski](/wiki/Sebastian_Janikowski \"Sebastian Janikowski\"), and\n[David Akers](/wiki/David_Akers \"David Akers\"). High school, college and most\nprofessional football leagues offer only a three-point field goal; however,\nsome professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through _four-point\nfield goals_. [NFL Europe](/wiki/NFL_Europe \"NFL Europe\") encouraged long\nfield goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of\nthree (much like Australian rules' [Super Goal](/wiki/Super_Goal \"Super Goal\")\nor basketball's [three-point line](/wiki/Three-point_field_goal \"Three-point\nfield goal\")), a rule since adopted by the [Stars Football\nLeague](/wiki/Stars_Football_League \"Stars Football League\"). Similarly, the\nsport of [arena football](/wiki/Arena_football \"Arena football\") sought\n(unsuccessfully) to repopularize the [drop kick](/wiki/Drop_kick \"Drop kick\")\nby making that worth four points; it failed, since only one kicker ([Brian\nMitchell](/wiki/Brian_Mitchell_\\(kicker\\) \"Brian Mitchell \\(kicker\\)\")) was\nable to do it with any semblance of proficiency. (In [six-man\nfootball](/wiki/Six-man_football \"Six-man football\"), where there is no\noffensive line, all field goals are worth four points instead of the usual\nthree.)\n\nThe overall field goal percentage during the [2010 NFL\nseason](/wiki/2010_NFL_season \"2010 NFL season\") was 82.3. In comparison, [Jan\nStenerud](/wiki/Jan_Stenerud \"Jan Stenerud\"), one of only two pure kickers in\nthe [Pro Football Hall of Fame](/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame \"Pro Football\nHall of Fame\") (along with [Ray Guy](/wiki/Ray_Guy \"Ray Guy\")), had a career\nfield goal percentage of 66.8 from 1967 to 1985.[2]\n\n## How field goals are\nkicked[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Field_goal&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: How field goals are kicked\")]\n\n![File:Field\nGoal.ogv](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Field_Goal.ogv/220px\n--Field_Goal.ogv.jpg)[Play\nmedia](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Field_Goal.ogv \"Play\nmedia\")\n\n[](/wiki/File:Field_Goal.ogv \"Enlarge\")\n\nVideo of a successful field goal try.\n\nWhen a team decides to attempt a field goal, it will generally line up in a\nvery tight formation, with all but two players lined up along or near the line\nof scrimmage: the [placekicker](/wiki/Placekicker \"Placekicker\") and the\nholder. The holder is usually the team's\n[punter](/wiki/Punter_\\(football_position\\) \"Punter \\(football position\\)\") or\nbackup [quarterback](/wiki/Quarterback \"Quarterback\").[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Instead\nof the regular [center](/wiki/Center_\\(American_football\\) \"Center \\(American\nfootball\\)\"), a team may have a dedicated [long snapper](/wiki/Long_snapper\n\"Long snapper\") trained especially to snap the ball on placekick attempts and\npunts.\n\nThe holder usually lines up seven to eight yards behind the line of scrimmage,\nwith the kicker a few yards behind him. Upon receiving the snap, the holder\nholds the ball against the ground vertically, with the stitches away from the\nkicker. The kicker begins his approach during the snap, so the snapper and\nholder have little margin for error. A split-second mistake can disrupt the\nentire attempt.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/2006TexasA%26MvsCitadel_fieldgoal.jpg/213px-2006TexasA%26MvsCitadel_fieldgoal.jpg)](/wiki/File:2006TexasA%26MvsCitadel_fieldgoal.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:2006TexasA%26MvsCitadel_fieldgoal.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Texas A&M](/wiki/Texas_A%26M_University \"Texas A&M University\") attempts to\nkick a field goal against [the Citadel](/wiki/The_Citadel_\\(military_college\\)\n\"The Citadel \\(military college\\)\") in 2006.\n\nThe measurement of a field goal's distance is from the goalpost to the point\nwhere the ball was positioned for the kick by the holder. In American\nfootball, where the goalpost is located at the back of the end zone (above the\nend line), the ten yards of the end zone are added to the yard line distance\nat the spot of the hold.\n\nIn the early days of the sport, placekickers approached the ball straight on,\nwith the toe making first contact with the ball. The technique of kicking the\nball \"[soccer-style](/wiki/Association_football_tactics_and_skills\n\"Association football tactics and skills\")\", by approaching the ball at an\nangle and kicking it with the instep, was introduced by kicker [Pete\nGogolak](/wiki/Pete_Gogolak \"Pete Gogolak\") in the 1960s.[3] The\n[Hungarian](/wiki/Hungary \"Hungary\")-born Gogolak, reflecting his roots in\nEuropean soccer, observed that kicking the ball at an angle could cover more\ndistance than kicking straight on.\n\n## Successful field\ngoals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Field_goal&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Successful field goals\")]\n\nIf there is any time left in the half, the method of resuming play after a\nsuccessful field goal varies between leagues.\n\nNational Football League\n\n    The scored-against team receives a kickoff.[4]\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association\n\n    The scored-against team receives a kickoff.[5]\nNational Federation of High Schools\n\n    The scored-against team can choose to either receive a kickoff or kick off themselves. (In practice, almost all choose to receive.)\nCanadian Football League\n\n    The scored-against team may elect to either kick off, receive a kickoff, or scrimmage from the 35-yard line. The option of scrimmaging from the 35 yard line was eliminated for the [2009 CFL season](/wiki/2009_CFL_season \"2009 CFL season\"), but the change proved unpopular and was reversed the following year.\nFootball Canada\n\n    The scored-against team may elect to scrimmage the ball at its own 35-yard line, kick off from its own 35-yard line, or require the scoring team to kick off from its 45-yard line.[6]\n\n## Missed field\ngoals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Field_goal&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Missed field goals\")]\n\nA missed field goal is said to be \"no good\" if the kicked ball does not cross\nbetween the uprights and/or over the crossbar of the goal posts. If it misses\nto the posts' left it may be called \"wide left\" and \"wide right\" if it misses\nto the posts' right. A field goal attempt may be described as \"short\" if it\ndoes not have sufficient distance to go over the cross bar. Some commentators\nwill only describe a field goal attempt as being short if it appears to have\nbeen aimed correctly while others will describe an attempt appearing to lack\nboth accuracy and distance as being both wide and short.\n\nIf a field goal attempt is missed and does not go out of bounds, a defensive\nplayer may catch the ball and return it, like a punt or kickoff. This type of\nplay usually occurs during an extremely long field goal attempt due to the\ndistance the defense must travel to reach the returner. If there is a\nsignificant likelihood of a miss and the strategic game situation warrants it,\nthe defense places a player downfield, in or near their end zone, to catch the\nball. The risk in this is that the return man may be tackled deep in his own\nterritory, at a considerably worse position than he could have gotten by\nletting the ball go dead (see below); furthermore, should the returner fumble\nthe ball, the kicking team can recover it and gain a new set of downs (the\nadvantage is that the kicking team is lined up very close together to stop\nkick blockers, and not spread across the field like a kickoff or punt team,\nand is therefore in poor position to defend the return). Thus, teams will\nusually return a kick only towards the end of a half (when the kick will be\nthe final play) or in a particularly desperate situation.\n\nIf a ball caroms off one of the goal posts or the crossbar, but lands in the\nfield of play, the ball is considered dead and cannot be returned. (This is\nnot the case in [arena football](/wiki/Arena_football \"Arena football\"), where\nlarge \"rebound nets\" surround the goal posts for the explicit purpose of\nkeeping the ball in play.) However, if the ball caroms off one of the goal\nposts or the crossbar and continues into the goal, the score counts.\n\nSituations where the defense does not return a missed field goal vary between\nleagues and levels of play:\n\nNational Football League\n\n    Missed field goals attempted from the defending team's 20-yard line or closer result in the defense taking possession at their 20-yard line. Missed field goals attempted from behind the 20-yard line result in the opposing team taking possession at the **spot of the kick**. (Until 1994, the opposing team would take possession at the line of scrimmage, unless the kick was attempted from inside the 20-yard line, in which case the opposing team would take possession at the 20-yard line.)\nNCAA\n\n    The opposing team takes possession at the line of scrimmage rather than at the spot of the kick. If the line of scrimmage is inside the 20-yard line, the opposing team takes possession at the 20.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nHigh school\n\n    Under NFHS (high school) rules, a field goal attempt is no different from any other scrimmage kick (punt, drop kick). If the field goal attempt is no good and enters the end zone it is a [touchback](/wiki/Touchback \"Touchback\"). If the ball becomes dead on the field the defensive team will next put the ball in play from that point. If a field goal is blocked behind the line of scrimmage either team may pick it up and return it (see below).\nCanadian football\n\n    If the defense does not return a missed field goal out of the end zone, or if a missed field goal attempt goes out the back of end zone, then the kicking team scores a [single point](/wiki/Single_\\(football\\) \"Single \\(football\\)\"). This sometimes results in the team on defense stationing their punter behind the goal posts to punt the ball out of the end zone, in case of a missed field-goal attempt, to preserve a victory or tie. Also, a missed field goal may be played by any onside player on the kicking team, (onside players being the kicker and anyone behind him at the time of the kick). It is risky to have anyone positioned behind the kicker when the ball is being kicked since those player(s) would be unable to help prevent the defending players from blocking the kick; however, on occasion teams might intentionally miss a field goal in hope of recovering the ball in the end zone for a touchdown. Returning a missed field goal is much more likely in Canadian football than in American rules for a few reasons. First, since the goal posts are on the goal line in front of a 20-yard end zone (rather than at the back of a 10-yard end zone), a missed field goal is much less likely to go out of bounds while in the air. Also, not returning the ball out of the end zone results in the defense conceding a single point, which may be crucial in a close game. Moreover, the wider field of the Canadian game makes the average return longer (in terms of yardage). However, many Canadian football coaches judge that conceding a single and taking possession at the 35-yard line is preferable to returning a missed field goal and avoiding a single at the cost of poor field position.\n\n## Blocked field\ngoals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Field_goal&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Blocked field goals\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/David_Akers_field_goal_blocked_at_Eagles_at_49ers_10-12-08.JPG/220px-\nDavid_Akers_field_goal_blocked_at_Eagles_at_49ers_10-12-08.JPG)](/wiki/File:David_Akers_field_goal_blocked_at_Eagles_at_49ers_10-12-08.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:David_Akers_field_goal_blocked_at_Eagles_at_49ers_10-12-08.JPG\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [San Francisco 49ers](/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers \"San Francisco 49ers\")\nblock a field goal attempt by [Philadelphia Eagles](/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles\n\"Philadelphia Eagles\") kicker [David Akers](/wiki/David_Akers \"David Akers\")\non October 12, 2008, and return it for a touchdown.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Fresno_State_Texas_Aggies_Blocked_Kick.jpg/220px-\nFresno_State_Texas_Aggies_Blocked_Kick.jpg)](/wiki/File:Fresno_State_Texas_Aggies_Blocked_Kick.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Fresno_State_Texas_Aggies_Blocked_Kick.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [Fresno State Bulldogs](/wiki/Fresno_State_Bulldogs_football \"Fresno State\nBulldogs football\") block a [Texas A&M](/wiki/Texas_A%26M_Aggies_football\n\"Texas A&M Aggies football\") field goal attempt.\n\nOccasionally, the defense will succeed in blocking a field goal. If a blocked\nfield goal is in or behind the neutral zone, it is treated like a\n[fumble](/wiki/Fumble \"Fumble\") and can be advanced by either team. Beyond the\nneutral zone, a blocked kick is treated like a punt and can be advanced only\nby the defense, unless a defensive player fumbles the ball, after which an\noffensive player can advance it.\n\n## History[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Field_goal&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: History\")]\n\nIn the early days of football, kicking was highly emphasized. In\n[1883](/wiki/1883_college_football_season \"1883 college football season\"), the\nscoring system was devised, with field goals counting for 5 points, and\ntouchdowns and conversions worth 4 apiece. In\n[1897](/wiki/1897_college_football_season \"1897 college football season\"), the\ntouchdown was raised to 5 points while the conversion was lowered to 1 point.\nField goals were devalued to 4 points in\n[1904](/wiki/1904_college_football_season \"1904 college football season\"), and\nthen to the modern 3 points in [1909](/wiki/1909_college_football_season \"1909\ncollege football season\"). The touchdown was changed to 6 points in\n[1912](/wiki/1912_college_football_season \"1912 college football season\") in\nAmerican football; the Canadian game followed suit in 1956.\n\nThe spot of the conversion has also changed through the years. In\n[1924](/wiki/1924_college_football_season \"1924 college football season\"),\nNCAA rules spotted the conversion at the 3-yard line, before moving it back to\nthe 5-yard line in [1925](/wiki/1925_college_football_season \"1925 college\nfootball season\"). In [1929](/wiki/1929_college_football_season \"1929 college\nfootball season\"), the spot was moved up to the 2-yard line, which the NFL had\ndone until [2014](/wiki/2014_NFL_season \"2014 NFL season\"). In\n[1968](/wiki/1968_college_football_season \"1968 college football season\"), the\nNCAA diverged from the NFL rules in moving the spot back to the original\n3-yard line. Canadian rules originally spotted the conversion at the 5-yard\nline, which remains closer than in the American code as the goalposts are at\nthe front of the end zone. In [2015](/wiki/2015_NFL_season \"2015 NFL season\"),\nto make conversion kicks harder, the NFL and CFL moved the spot of the kick to\nthe 15 and 25-yard lines, respectively. In addition, the CFL moved the spot\nfor a two-point conversion up to the 3-yard line to entice more teams to go\nfor 2 points as opposed to one.\n\nThe goalposts were originally located on the goal line; this led to many\ninjuries and sometimes interfered with play, and the NCAA moved the goal posts\nto the rear of the end zone 90 years ago in\n[1927](/wiki/1927_college_football_season \"1927 college football season\"). The\nNFL (still following NCAA rules at the time) followed suit, but moved the\nposts back to the goal line starting in the [1932 NFL Playoff\nGame](/wiki/1932_NFL_Playoff_Game \"1932 NFL Playoff Game\"), a change made\nnecessary by the size of the indoor [Chicago Stadium](/wiki/Chicago_Stadium\n\"Chicago Stadium\") and kept when the NFL rules stopped mirroring the NCAA\nrules in [1933](/wiki/1933_NFL_season \"1933 NFL season\"). The NFL kept the\npost at the goal line until 43 years ago, when they were moved back to the\nrear of the end zone for the [1974](/wiki/1974_NFL_season \"1974 NFL season\")\nseason. This was partly a result of the narrowed hashmark distance of\n[1972](/wiki/1972_NFL_season \"1972 NFL season\"), which had made for easier\nfield-goal angles. The Canadian game still has posts on the goal line.\n\nThe width of the goalposts and the hashmarks have also varied throughout the\nyears. In [1959](/wiki/1959_college_football_season \"1959 college football\nseason\"), the NCAA goalposts were widened to 23 feet 4 inches (7.11 m), the\nstandard width for high school posts today. In\n[1991](/wiki/1991_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season \"1991 NCAA Division I-A\nfootball season\"), the college goalposts were reduced in width to 18 ft 6 in\n(5.64 m), matching the NFL. For the 1991 and\n[1992](/wiki/1992_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season \"1992 NCAA Division I-A\nfootball season\") seasons, this meant potentially severe angles for short\nfield goal attempts, since the hashmark width remained at 53 ft 4 in (16.26\nm). In [1993](/wiki/1993_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season \"1993 NCAA Division\nI-A football season\"), the NCAA narrowed the distance between the hashmarks to\n40 ft (12.19 m), matching what was the width of hashmarks in the NFL from\n[1945](/wiki/1945_NFL_season \"1945 NFL season\") through\n[1971](/wiki/1971_NFL_season \"1971 NFL season\"); the NFL narrowed the\nhashmarks in 1972 to goalpost width at 18.5 feet (5.64 m). In the\n[CFL](/wiki/Canadian_Football_League \"Canadian Football League\"), the\nhashmarks are 51 feet (16 m), but the field is 195 feet (59 m) in width, 35\nfeet (11 m) wider than the American field.\n\nThe NFL increased the height of the uprights above the crossbar to 20 feet\n(6.10 m) in [1966](/wiki/1966_NFL_season \"1966 NFL season\") and 30 feet (9.14\nm) in 1974. In [2014](/wiki/2014_NFL_season \"2014 NFL season\"), they were\nraised five feet to 35 feet (10.67 m) after the adoption of a proposal by [New\nEngland Patriots](/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\") head\ncoach [Bill Belichick](/wiki/Bill_Belichick \"Bill Belichick\").[7]\n\nThe \"slingshot\" goalpost, with a single post curving to support the crossbar,\nwas invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman in [Montreal,\nQuebec](/wiki/Montreal \"Montreal\"), [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\").[8] The\nfirst were built by [Alcan](/wiki/Alcan \"Alcan\") and displayed at [Expo\n67](/wiki/Expo_67 \"Expo 67\"),[8][9] the [World's fair](/wiki/World%27s_fair\n\"World's fair\") in Montreal. The NFL had standardized the goalposts in 1966\nand adopted the slingshot for the [1967](/wiki/1967_NFL_season \"1967 NFL\nseason\") season;[8] the NCAA later adopted the same rule, but later allowed\nthe use of \"offset\" goalposts, with two posts rather than one. Three schools\nin [Division I FBS](/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision \"NCAA\nDivision I Football Bowl Subdivision\") currently use dual-support posts:\n[Florida State](/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football \"Florida State\nSeminoles football\"), [LSU](/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football \"LSU Tigers football\"),\nand [Washington State](/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_football \"Washington\nState Cougars football\"). A special exemption was allowed by the NFL for the\n[New Orleans Saints](/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints \"New Orleans Saints\") to use the\noffset goalposts during the [2005](/wiki/2005_New_Orleans_Saints_season \"2005\nNew Orleans Saints season\") season, when they used [LSU's\nstadium](/wiki/Tiger_Stadium_\\(LSU\\) \"Tiger Stadium \\(LSU\\)\") for home games\n[after](/wiki/Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_the_New_Orleans_Saints \"Effect of\nHurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Saints\") [Hurricane\nKatrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina \"Hurricane Katrina\").\n\nGoalposts at the professional level today are sometimes equipped with a camera\nmounted to the stanchion immediately behind the center of the crossbar.
