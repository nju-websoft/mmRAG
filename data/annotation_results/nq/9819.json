The concept arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by\nEastman during a casual evening of [brainstorming](/wiki/Brainstorming\n\"Brainstorming\") and bad television with Laird.[3] Using money from a [tax\nrefund](/wiki/Tax_refund \"Tax refund\"), together with a loan from Eastman’s\nuncle, the young artists [self-published](/wiki/Self-publishing \"Self-\npublishing\") a single-issue comic intended to [parody](/wiki/Parody \"Parody\")\nfour of the most popular comics of the early 1980s: [Marvel\nComics](/wiki/Marvel_Comics \"Marvel Comics\")’\n_[Daredevil](/wiki/Daredevil_\\(Marvel_Comics_character\\) \"Daredevil \\(Marvel\nComics character\\)\")_ and _[New Mutants](/wiki/New_Mutants \"New Mutants\")_ ,\n[Dave Sim](/wiki/Dave_Sim \"Dave Sim\")’s _[Cerebus](/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark\n\"Cerebus the Aardvark\")_ , and [Frank Miller](/wiki/Frank_Miller_\\(comics\\)\n\"Frank Miller \\(comics\\)\")’s _[Ronin](/wiki/Ronin_\\(DC_Comics\\) \"Ronin \\(DC\nComics\\)\")_.[4] The [_TMNT_ comic book\nseries](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(Mirage_Studios\\) \"Teenage Mutant\nNinja Turtles \\(Mirage Studios\\)\") has been published in various incarnations\nby various comic book companies since 1984.\n\nThe Turtles started their rise to mainstream success when a licensing agent,\nMark Freedman, sought out Eastman and Laird to propose wider merchandising\nopportunities for the franchise. In 1986, Dark Horse Miniatures produced a set\nof 15-mm (approximately 0.6 inch) lead figurines. In January 1987, Eastman and\nLaird visited the offices of [Playmates Toys](/wiki/Playmates_Toys \"Playmates\nToys\"), a small California toy company that wanted to expand into the action-\nfigure market. Development was undertaken by a creative team of companies and\nindividuals: Jerry Sachs, advertising agent of Sachs-Finley Agency, brought\ntogether the animators at [Murakami-Wolf-Swenson](/wiki/Fred_Wolf_Films \"Fred\nWolf Films\") headed by Fred Wolf. Wolf and his team combined concepts and\nideas with the Playmates marketing crew, headed by Karl Aaronian, vice\npresident (VP) of sales Richard Sallis, and VP of Playmates Bill Carlson.[5]\n\nAaronian brought on several designers and concepteur and writer [John C.\nSchulte](/wiki/John_C._Schulte \"John C. Schulte\"), and worked out the simple\nbackstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product\nand show.[5] Sachs called the [high concept](/wiki/High_concept \"High\nconcept\") pitch \"Green Against Brick\". The sense of humor was honed with the\ncollaboration of the Murakami-Wolf-Swenson animation firm's writers. Playmates\nand their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing\nwriters to the miniseries that was first launched to sell-in the toy action\nfigures. Phrases like \"Heroes in a half shell\" and many of the comical catch\nphrases and battle cries (\"Turtle power!\") came from the writing and\nconceptualization of this creative team. As the series developed, veteran\nwriter [Jack Mendelsohn](/wiki/Jack_Mendelsohn \"Jack Mendelsohn\") came on\nboard as both a story editor and scriptwriter. David Wise, Michael Charles\nHill, and [Michael Reaves](/wiki/Michael_Reaves \"Michael Reaves\") wrote most\nof the scripts.\n\nThe miniseries was repeated three times before it found an\naudience.[_[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify\n\"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_] Once the product started selling, the show got\nsyndicated and picked up and backed by [Group\nW](/wiki/Westinghouse_Broadcasting \"Westinghouse Broadcasting\"), which funded\nthe next round of animation. The show then went network, on [CBS](/wiki/CBS\n\"CBS\"). Accompanied by the popular [_Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ 1987 TV\nseries](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(1987_TV_series\\) \"Teenage Mutant\nNinja Turtles \\(1987 TV series\\)\"), and the subsequent [action figure\nline](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_action_figures \"Teenage Mutant Ninja\nTurtles action figures\"), _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ became a mainstream\nsuccess. At the height of the frenzy, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the\nTurtles' likenesses could be found on a wide range of children's merchandise,\nfrom [Pez dispensers](/wiki/Pez_dispenser \"Pez dispenser\") to skateboards,\nbreakfast cereal, video games, school supplies, linens, towels, cameras, and\ntoy shaving kits.\n\nWhile the animated TV series, which lasted for 10 seasons until 1996, was more\nlight-hearted, the comic-book series continued in a much darker and grittier\ntone. In 1990, a [live-action feature\nfilm](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(1990_film\\) \"Teenage Mutant Ninja\nTurtles \\(1990 film\\)\") was released, with the Turtles and\n[Splinter](/wiki/Splinter_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Splinter \\(Teenage\nMutant Ninja Turtles\\)\") being portrayed by actors in partially animatronic\nsuits created by [Jim Henson's Creature\nShop](/wiki/Jim_Henson%27s_Creature_Shop \"Jim Henson's Creature Shop\"). The\nfilm became one of the most successful independent films and spawned [two\nsequels](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(film_series\\) \"Teenage Mutant\nNinja Turtles \\(film series\\)\"), as well as inspiring a three-dimensional\nanimated film set in the same continuity, which was released in 2007 under the\ntitle _[TMNT](/wiki/TMNT_\\(film\\) \"TMNT \\(film\\)\")_. After the end of the\ncartoon series, a live-action series in the vein of the films was created in\n1997 in conjunction with [Saban Entertainment](/wiki/Saban_Entertainment\n\"Saban Entertainment\"). The series was called _[Ninja Turtles: The Next\nMutation](/wiki/Ninja_Turtles:_The_Next_Mutation \"Ninja Turtles: The Next\nMutation\")_ and introduced a fifth, female turtle called [Venus de\nMilo](/wiki/Venus_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Venus \\(Teenage Mutant\nNinja Turtles\\)\"). However, the series was largely unsuccessful and was\ncanceled after one season.\n\nThe property lay dormant until 2003, when a new animated TV series also\nentitled _[Teenage Mutant Ninja\nTurtles](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(2003_TV_series\\) \"Teenage Mutant\nNinja Turtles \\(2003 TV series\\)\")_ began to air on Fox Box ([4Kids\nTV](/wiki/4Kids_TV \"4Kids TV\")). The series storyline stuck much closer to the\noriginal Mirage comic book series, but was still less violent. It lasted for\nseven seasons and 156 episodes, ending in February 2009.\n\nOn October 21, 2009, it was announced that cable channel\n[Nickelodeon](/wiki/Nickelodeon \"Nickelodeon\") (a subsidiary of\n[Viacom](/wiki/Viacom \"Viacom\")) had purchased all of Mirage's rights to the\n_Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ property. Mirage retains the rights to publish\n18 issues a year, though the future involvement of Mirage with the Turtles and\nthe future of Mirage Studios itself is unknown.[6] Nickelodeon has developed a\nnew CGI-animated TMNT television series and partnered with fellow Viacom\ncompany [Paramount Pictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount Pictures\") to\nbring a new TMNT movie to theaters. The TV show premiered on Nickelodeon on\nSeptember 29, 2012.[7] The [live-action\nfilm](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(2014_film\\) \"Teenage Mutant Ninja\nTurtles \\(2014 film\\)\"), produced by [Platinum Dunes](/wiki/Platinum_Dunes\n\"Platinum Dunes\"), [Nickelodeon Movies](/wiki/Nickelodeon_Movies \"Nickelodeon\nMovies\"), and [Paramount Pictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures \"Paramount\nPictures\"), directed by [Jonathan Liebesman](/wiki/Jonathan_Liebesman\n\"Jonathan Liebesman\"), and produced by [Michael Bay](/wiki/Michael_Bay\n\"Michael Bay\"), was released on August 8, 2014.[8]\n\n## Main\ncharacters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Main characters\")]\n\nMain article: [List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\ncharacters](/wiki/List_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_characters \"List of\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters\")\n\n  * [Leonardo](/wiki/Leonardo_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Leonardo \\(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\)\") (Leo) – The tactical, courageous leader and devoted student of his _sensei_ , Leonardo wears a blue mask and wields two _[katana](/wiki/Katana \"Katana\")_. As the most conscientious of the four, he often bears the burden of responsibility for his brothers, which commonly leads to conflict with Raphael. Leonardo was named after the Italian polymath, painter, engineer, inventor, writer, anatomist, and sculptor, [Leonardo da Vinci](/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci \"Leonardo da Vinci\").\n  * [Michelangelo](/wiki/Michelangelo_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Michelangelo \\(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\)\") (Mikey) – The most stereotypical teenager of the team, Michelangelo is a free-spirited, relaxed, and often goofy jokester, and known for his love of pizza. Michelangelo wears an orange mask and wields a pair of [nunchucks](/wiki/Nunchuck \"Nunchuck\"). He provides the [comic relief](/wiki/Comic_relief \"Comic relief\"), though he still has an adventurous side. The least mature of the four Turtles, he shows characteristics of a \"[surfer](/wiki/Surfer \"Surfer\")\" type and is often depicted with a [Southern Californian](/wiki/California_English \"California English\") accent. He is named after the Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, poet, and engineer, [Michelangelo](/wiki/Michelangelo \"Michelangelo\"). His name was originally misspelled \"Michaelangelo\" by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman.[9]\n  * [Donatello](/wiki/Donatello_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Donatello \\(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\)\") (Donnie or Don) – The scientist, inventor, engineer, and technological genius, Donatello wears a purple mask and wields a [bo staff](/wiki/Bo_staff \"Bo staff\"). Donatello is perhaps the least violent turtle, preferring to use his knowledge to solve conflicts, but never hesitates to defend his brothers. He is named after the early Renaissance Italian artist and sculptor from Florence, [Donatello](/wiki/Donatello \"Donatello\").\n  * [Raphael](/wiki/Raphael_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Raphael \\(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\)\") (Raph) – The team's bad boy, Raphael wears a red mask and wields a pair of [_sai_](/wiki/Sai_\\(weapon\\) \"Sai \\(weapon\\)\"). He has an aggressive nature, and seldom hesitates to throw the first punch. He is often depicted with a very pronounced [New York](/wiki/New_York_City_English \"New York City English\") accent. His personality can be fierce and sarcastic, and oftentimes delivers [deadpan](/wiki/Deadpan \"Deadpan\") humor. He is intensely loyal to his brothers and _sensei_. He is named after the Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance, [Raphael](/wiki/Raphael \"Raphael\").[9]\n  * [Splinter](/wiki/Splinter_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Splinter \\(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\)\") – The Turtles' _[sensei](/wiki/Sensei \"Sensei\")_ and adoptive father, Splinter is a Japanese mutant rat that learned the ways of _ninjutsu_ from his owner and master, [Hamato Yoshi](/wiki/Hamato_Yoshi \"Hamato Yoshi\"). In the [1987 TV series](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(1987_TV_series\\) \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles \\(1987 TV series\\)\"), [Archie Comics series](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Adventures \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures\"), and the [2012 TV series](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(2012_TV_series\\) \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles \\(2012 TV series\\)\"), Splinter was Hamato Yoshi mutated into a humanoid rat. In the [2003 TV series,](/wiki/TMNT_2003 \"TMNT 2003\") he was Hamato Yoshi's pet rat. He was mutated from a mysterious ooze from the TCRI building. In the [IDW comics](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(IDW_Publishing\\) \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles \\(IDW Publishing\\)\"), he is Hamato Yoshi reincarnated as a mutated rat.\n  * [April O'Neil](/wiki/April_O%27Neil \"April O'Neil\") – A former lab assistant to the [mad scientist](/wiki/Mad_scientist \"Mad scientist\") [Baxter Stockman](/wiki/Baxter_Stockman \"Baxter Stockman\"), April is the plucky human companion of the Turtles. April first met the Turtles when they saved her from Baxter's Mouser robots. She embarks on many of the Turtles' adventures and aids them by doing the work in public that the Turtles cannot. In the 1987 TV series, Archie Comics series, the subsequent three films, and [the 2014 film reboot](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(2014_film\\) \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles \\(2014 film\\)\"), April was a television news reporter. In the [2007 CGI film](/wiki/TMNT_\\(2007_film\\) \"TMNT \\(2007 film\\)\") (following the continuity from the original three films), Casey Jones and she work for a shipping firm. In the 2012 series, April is a teenager who is rescued by the TMNTs and later given some \"crash courses\" in being a _ninja_ by Splinter.\n  * [Casey Jones](/wiki/Casey_Jones_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Casey Jones \\(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\)\") – A [vigilante](/wiki/Vigilante \"Vigilante\") who wears a [hockey mask](/wiki/Hockey_mask \"Hockey mask\") to protect his identity, Casey Jones has become one of the Turtles' closest allies, as well as a love interest to April. Casey first encountered the Turtles after having a fight with Raphael. He fights crime with an assortment of sporting goods he carries in a golf bag, such as baseball bats, golf clubs, and hockey sticks.\n  * [The Shredder](/wiki/Shredder_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Shredder \\(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\)\") – A villainous _[ninjutsu](/wiki/Ninjutsu \"Ninjutsu\")_ master called Oroku Saki, he is the leader of the [Foot Clan](/wiki/Foot_Clan \"Foot Clan\"), an evil ninja clan. In every incarnation of the TMNT franchise, he has been the archenemy of Splinter and the Turtles. The Shredder prefers to use his armor instead of weapons in some versions.\n  * [Foot Soldiers/Ninjas](/wiki/Foot_Ninja \"Foot Ninja\") – The ninjas of the [Foot Clan](/wiki/Foot_Clan \"Foot Clan\"), working for the Shredder.\n  * [Karai](/wiki/Karai_\\(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\\) \"Karai \\(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\)\") – A female high-rank member of the Foot Clan, she has appeared in several different TMNT comics, cartoons, and films, as well as in multiple video games. In some incarnations of the character, she is closely related to Shredder as his adopted daughter or biological granddaughter. In most works, she shares an ambiguous rivalry with Leonardo, which occasionally even borders on romantic interest.\n\n##\nComics[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Comics\")]\n\n###\nMirage[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Mirage\")]\n\nMain article: [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage\nStudios)](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(Mirage_Studios\\) \"Teenage\nMutant Ninja Turtles \\(Mirage Studios\\)\")\n\nEastman and Laird's _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ premiered in May 1984, at a\ncomic book convention held at a local Sheraton Hotel in [Portsmouth, New\nHampshire](/wiki/Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire \"Portsmouth, New Hampshire\"). It\nwas published by [Mirage Studios](/wiki/Mirage_Studios \"Mirage Studios\") in an\noversized magazine-style format using black and white artwork on cheap\nnewsprint, limited to a print run of only 3,250 copies.[10] Through a clever\nmedia kit that included a press release in Comic Buyer's Guide #542 and a\nfull-page ad placed in _Comic Buyer 's Guide #547_, the public's interest was\npiqued and thus began the Turtle phenomenon. The small print runs made these\nearly comics and trade magazines instant collector items, and within months,\nthey were trading for over 50 times their cover price. The name \"Mirage\nStudios\" was chosen because of Eastman and Laird's lack of a professional art\nstudio at the start of their career, before their creation made them both\nmultimillionaires.\n\nMirage also published a bimonthly companion book entitled _[Tales of the\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](/wiki/Tales_of_the_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\n\"Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\")_ , featuring art by [Ryan\nBrown](/wiki/Ryan_Brown_\\(comics\\) \"Ryan Brown \\(comics\\)\") and [Jim\nLawson](/wiki/Jim_Lawson_\\(comic_book_writer\\) \"Jim Lawson \\(comic book\nwriter\\)\"), which was designed to fill in the gaps of continuity in the TMNT\nuniverse. This put the original series and _Tales_ in the same mainstream\ncontinuity, and the two are thus [canon](/wiki/Canon_\\(fiction\\) \"Canon\n\\(fiction\\)\") to each other. The title's first volume was from 1987–1989,\nreleased in alternating months with the regular Eastman and Laird book. All\nseven issues of volume one have been collected in trade paperback form twice,\nand 25 issues of volume two have been collected in trades of five issues each.\n\nAs the TMNT phenomenon proliferated to other media, Eastman and Laird found\nthemselves administrating an international merchandising juggernaut. However,\nthis prevented the two creators from participating in the day-to-day work of\nwriting and illustrating a monthly comic book. So, many guest artists were\ninvited to showcase their unique talents in the TMNT universe. The breadth of\ndiversity found in the various short stories gave the series a disjointed,\n[anthology-like](/wiki/Anthology \"Anthology\") feel. Fans stuck with the\nseries, and what was originally intended as a one-shot became a continuing\nseries that lasted for 129 issues, spanning four separate volumes (having 62,\n13, 23, and 32 issues in the four distinct volumes).\n\nIn June 1996, [Image Comics](/wiki/Image_Comics \"Image Comics\") took over\npublishing the title in what is considered \"volume 3\" of the series. It was a\nslightly more action-oriented TMNT series and although notable for inflicting\nmajor physical changes on the main characters, Peter Laird, co-creator of the\nTMNT, has said this volume is no longer in canon as he began publishing volume\n4 at Mirage Publishing. As an explanation, he offered in the pages of the\nvolume 4 (issue #8) letter column: \"It just didn't feel right.\" [11]\n\nAfter taking back the series from Image Comics, Mirage Studios resumed\npublication of a fourth volume in December 2001, under the simple title\n_TMNT_. After the publication of issue number 28, writer Peter Laird placed\nthe series on an eight-month hiatus to devote himself to production of the\n2007 _TMNT_ movie. However, after that eight months had passed, Mirage's\nofficial website went on to list the series as in \"indefinite hiatus\". In\nJanuary 2008, Mirage had finally confirmed that the series would return in May\n2008. Issues 29 and 30 had a limited printing of 1,000 copies each, and were\navailable through the official TMNT website. Although the purchase agreement\nwith Nickelodeon allows Laird to produce up to 18 comics a year set in the\noriginal Mirage continuity, no new material was released in the next few\nyears. The latest issue of TMNT volume 4 was issue #32 which came out in print\nMay 4, 2014, and online on May 9, 2014, almost 4 years after issue #31 was\nlast released.\n\n### _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nAdventures_[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures\")]\n\nMain article: [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nAdventures](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Adventures \"Teenage Mutant\nNinja Turtles Adventures\")\n\n_[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nAdventures](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Adventures \"Teenage Mutant\nNinja Turtles Adventures\")_ was a comic-book series published from August 1988\nto October 1995 by [Archie Comics](/wiki/Archie_Comics \"Archie Comics\").

The series was produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson Film Productions,\nInc. (later [Fred Wolf Films](/wiki/Fred_Wolf_Films_Dublin \"Fred Wolf Films\nDublin\")). Mirage Studios does not own the rights to this cartoon series. The\nshow places a much stronger emphasis on humor than the comics do. Here, the\nNinja Turtles are portrayed as four wise-cracking, [pizza](/wiki/Pizza\n\"Pizza\")-obsessed superheroes that fight the forces of evil from their sewer\nhideout, and they make their first appearance in masks color-coded to each\nturtle, where previously they had all worn red.[15]\n\nThe cast included new and different characters, such as [Bebop and\nRocksteady](/wiki/Bebop_and_Rocksteady \"Bebop and Rocksteady\") and the\nNeutrinos. Original characters such as [Splinter](/wiki/Splinter_\\(TMNT\\)\n\"Splinter \\(TMNT\\)\"), [Shredder](/wiki/Shredder_\\(TMNT\\) \"Shredder \\(TMNT\\)\"),\nand the [Foot Soldiers](/wiki/Foot_Clan \"Foot Clan\") stayed true to the comics\nin appearance and alignment only. Instead of being Hamato Yoshi's mutated pet\nrat, Splinter was a mutated Hamato himself. The Foot Soldiers changed from\nhuman ninjas to an endless supply of robotic grunts, allowing large numbers of\nthem to be destroyed without anyone dying (this was a very important decision\nin terms of the show's child audience; excessive violence would have alienated\nparents of children, the show's target demographic). [Krang](/wiki/Krang\n\"Krang\"), one of the series' most memorable villains, was inspired by the\ndesign of the Utrom, a benign alien race from the Mirage comics. The animated\nKrang, however, was instead an evil warlord from [Dimension\nX](/wiki/Dimension_X_\\(TMNT\\) \"Dimension X \\(TMNT\\)\"). [Baxter\nStockman](/wiki/Baxter_Stockman \"Baxter Stockman\"), whose race was changed\nfrom [black](/wiki/Black_people \"Black people\") to [white](/wiki/White_people\n\"White people\") either due to apprehension toward depicting a villainous\n[African American](/wiki/African_American \"African American\") character in a\nchildren's cartoon or that for Shredder to boss around a black Stockman would\nbe perceived as [racist](/wiki/Racist \"Racist\"). Either way, Stockman was\nrewritten as a shy and meek lackey to Shredder, later mutating into an\nanthropomorphic [housefly](/wiki/Housefly \"Housefly\"). During the final two\nseasons of the show, to combat the rising popularity of _[Mighty Morphin Power\nRangers](/wiki/Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\")_ ,\nthe lead villain switched to Lord Dregg, an evil alien overlord bent on world\nconquest by trying to distract the public into believing that the Turtles were\nthe enemy instead of himself.\n\nStarting on September 25, 1989, the series was expanded to weekdays and it had\n47 more episodes for the new season. There were 28 new syndicated episodes for\nseason 4 and only 13 of those episodes aired in 1990. The \"European Vacation\"\nepisodes were not seen in the United States until [USA\nNetwork](/wiki/USA_Network \"USA Network\") started showing reruns in late 1993\nand the \"Awesome Easter\" episodes were not seen until 1991. These episodes\nwere delayed because of animation or scheduling problems.[16] The turtles are\nalso well known for their use of idiomatic expressions characteristic of the\nsurfer lingo of the time, especially by Michelangelo. Words and phrases\nincluded \"bummer\", \"dude\", \"bogus\", \"radical\", \"far-out\", \"tubuloso\",\n\"bodacious\", and possibly the most recognized, \"cowabunga\".[17] On April 21,\n1990, a drug-prevention television special was broadcast on\n[ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\"),\n[NBC](/wiki/NBC \"NBC\"), and [CBS](/wiki/CBS \"CBS\") named _[Cartoon All-Stars\nto the Rescue](/wiki/Cartoon_All-Stars_to_the_Rescue \"Cartoon All-Stars to the\nRescue\")_ that featured some of the most popular cartoons at the time;\nrepresenting TMNT was Michelangelo, voiced by Townsend Coleman.\n\nStarting on September 8, 1990 (with a different opening sequence), the show\nbegan its run on CBS. The CBS weekend edition ran for a full hour until 1994,\ninitially airing a few Saturday-exclusive episodes back-to-back. Also, a brief\n\"Turtle Tips\" segment aired between the two episodes, which served as public-\nservice announcement about the environment or other issues. After 1994, the\nshow was reduced to just a half-hour and only eight episodes per season were\nproduced, grouped into a \"CBS Action Zone\" block that also featured\n_[WildC.A.T.s.](/wiki/Wildcats_\\(comics\\) \"Wildcats \\(comics\\)\")_ and\n_[Skeleton Warriors](/wiki/Skeleton_Warriors \"Skeleton Warriors\")_ , both of\nwhich were canceled after one season; though TMNTs retained their \"Action\nZone\" introduction. The two shows in the block were also produced by Fred Wolf\nFilms. The series ran until November 2, 1996, when it aired its final episode.\nIts enormous popularity gave rise to its numerous imitators, including the\n_[Battletoads](/wiki/Battletoads \"Battletoads\")_ ,\n_[Cheetahmen](/wiki/Cheetahmen \"Cheetahmen\")_ , _[Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo\nMesa](/wiki/Wild_West_C.O.W.-Boys_of_Moo_Mesa \"Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo\nMesa\")_ , _[Road Rovers](/wiki/Road_Rovers \"Road Rovers\")_ , _[Street\nSharks](/wiki/Street_Sharks \"Street Sharks\")_ , _[Extreme\nDinosaurs](/wiki/Extreme_Dinosaurs \"Extreme Dinosaurs\")_ , and _[Biker Mice\nfrom Mars](/wiki/Biker_Mice_from_Mars \"Biker Mice from Mars\")_.

The\nOVA is similar in tone to the 1987 TV series and uses the same voices from [TV\nTokyo](/wiki/TV_Tokyo \"TV Tokyo\")'s Japanese dub of the 1987 TV series. The\nfirst episode was made to advertise the _TMNT Supermutants_ toys. It featured\nthe Turtles as [superheroes](/wiki/Superhero \"Superhero\"), that gained\ncostumes and superpowers with the use of Mutastones, while Shredder, Bebop and\nRocksteady gained supervillain powers with the use of a Dark Mutastone. As\nwith the _[Super Sentai](/wiki/Super_Sentai \"Super Sentai\")_ and _[Power\nRangers](/wiki/Power_Rangers \"Power Rangers\")_ franchises, the four Turtles\ncould combine to form the giant Turtle Saint.

A pay-per-view special highlighting the concert was\nshown, and a studio album was also released.[41] The track listing is as\nfollows:\n\n[show]\n\nConcert tour track list\n\n  1. \"Coming Out of Our Shells!\"\n  2. \"Sing About It\"\n  3. \"Tubin'\"\n  4. \"Skipping Stones\"\n  5. \"Pizza Power\"\n  6. \"Walk Straight\"\n  7. \"No Treaties\"\n  8. \"Cowabunga\"\n  9. \"April Ballad\"\n  10. \"Count on Us\"\n\n  \n---  \n  \nSince the tour was sponsored by [Pizza Hut](/wiki/Pizza_Hut \"Pizza Hut\") in\nreal life, many references are made to their pizza.

Dark Horse Comics' _[Boris the\nBear](/wiki/Boris_the_Bear \"Boris the Bear\")_ was launched in response to\nthese TMNT clones; its first issue was titled \"Boris the Bear Slaughters the\nTeenage Radioactive Black Belt Mutant Ninja Critters\". Once the Turtles broke\ninto the mainstream, parodies also proliferated in other media, such as in\nsatire magazines _[Cracked](/wiki/Cracked_\\(magazine\\) \"Cracked\n\\(magazine\\)\")_ and _[Mad](/wiki/Mad_\\(magazine\\) \"Mad \\(magazine\\)\")_\nmagazine and numerous TV series of the period.

As the TMNT were\nintroduced into the mainstream, they were radically redesigned. In issue #19\nof _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ , the creators published an editorial\naddressing any possible concerns of readers as a result of this. It stated, in\npart: \"We've allowed the wacky side to happen, and enjoy it very much. All the\nwhile, though, we've kept the originals very much ours – forty pages of what\nwe enjoy and want to see in our books, whether it comes from our own hands or\nfrom those of the talented people we work with.\"[43] In the film _[Turtles\nForever](/wiki/Turtles_Forever \"Turtles Forever\")_ , the original Mirage\nTurtles refer to their descendants as \"sell-outs\", in reference to their\ncolorful accessories (the originals are conveyed in black and white).\n\n### Teenage Mutant \"Hero\" Turtles\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: Teenage Mutant \"Hero\" Turtles\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/TMNTCensoredTitle.jpg)](/wiki/File:TMNTCensoredTitle.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:TMNTCensoredTitle.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe title screen from the _TMHT_ version, altered due to censorship.\n\nUpon TMNT's first arrival in the United Kingdom and Ireland the name was\nchanged to \"Teenage Mutant _Hero_ Turtles\" (or TMHT, for short), since local\ncensorship policies deemed the word _ninja_ to have excessively violent\nconnotations for a children's program (in Ireland, however, the first season\naired as \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" before the change to \"Teenage Mutant\nHero Turtles\").[44] Consequently, everything related to the Turtles (comic\nbooks, video games, toys, etc.) had to be renamed before being released in\nthese nations, as well as in the German-speaking countries.\n\nThe lyrics were also changed, such as changing \"Splinter taught them to be\n_ninja_ teens\" to \"Splinter taught them to be _fighting_ teens\". The policies\nalso had other effects, such as editing out use of Michelangelo's nunchaku\n(which were at the time banned by [James Ferman](/wiki/James_Ferman \"James\nFerman\"), chairman of the [BBFC](/wiki/BBFC \"BBFC\"), from appearing in films\nand generally toning down the usage of all the turtles' weapons.[45] To head\nthis problem off, the showrunners elected to remove Michelangelo's nunchaku\nentirely during season three, replacing them with a [grappling\nhook](/wiki/Grappling_hook \"Grappling hook\") called the \"Turtle Line\" that\nserved as Mikey's signature weapon for the rest of the show's run.[3]\n\nIn Italy, Spain and Portugal, they kept Michelangelo's nunchaku but the \"TMHT\"\nlogo could be seen in the intro, as it was not edited to reflect the title in\neach of those translations. In Spain the cartoon was originally aired in\nregional TV channels and thus had different dubs in addition to\n[Castillian](/wiki/Spanish_language \"Spanish language\"):\n[Galician](/wiki/Galician_language \"Galician language\") and\n[Catalan](/wiki/Catalan_language \"Catalan language\");[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] in the\nGalician version, the title _As Tartarugas Mutantes_ (\"The Mutant Turtles\")\nwas used. The Italian and [European Portuguese](/wiki/European_Portuguese\n\"European Portuguese\") dubs also had few edits.\n\nHowever, when the [live-action\nmovie](/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_\\(1990_film\\) \"Teenage Mutant Ninja\nTurtles \\(1990 film\\)\") came out in 1990, the _Ninja_ of the title was kept\neven in the UK. In time, nunchaku scenes were retained in previously-censored\nmovies such as those of [Bruce Lee](/wiki/Bruce_Lee \"Bruce Lee\"). The same\nwent for the PAL releases of the early video games, which had Michelangelo's\nweapon of choice fully visible and usable. By the time of the 2003 TV series,\nthese censorship policies had been abolished, and no changes have occurred in\nthe content of the show. The name \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" remained\nunchanged for the 2003 TV series. As a result, in the UK, the 1987 TV series\nis still called _Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles_ and the 2003 TV series is called\n_Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_. In 2009,\n[Lionsgate](/wiki/Lionsgate_Home_Entertainment \"Lionsgate Home Entertainment\")\nHome Entertainment released the 25th Anniversary Collectors Edition on Region\n2 DVD in the UK. This 3-Disc set contains all the episodes of Seasons 1 and 2\nand 4 episodes from the final season, as well as a 1-Disc DVD with the first\nfew episodes of Season 1. This release features the original, unedited\nepisodes under the \"Ninja Turtles\" title, and also marks the first time the\nshow has been released and left uncensored in the UK.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## Ownership\nrights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles&action=edit&section=30\n\"Edit section: Ownership rights\")]\n\nDue to various movie and television deals, the various TMNT films and\ntelevision series have split between various companies, with [Mirage\nStudios](/wiki/Mirage_Studios \"Mirage Studios\") having retained copyright and\ntrademark until October 19, 2009, at which point the rights for the entire\nTMNT franchise were sold by co-creator Peter Laird to\n[Nickelodeon](/wiki/Nickelodeon \"Nickelodeon\").[46]\n\n###\nTelevision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles&action=edit&section=31\n\"Edit section: Television\")]\n\nThe original animated series (1987–1996) was produced by [Fred Wolf Films\nDublin](/wiki/Fred_Wolf_Films_Dublin \"Fred Wolf Films Dublin\") (as _Murakami\nWolf Swenson_ (_MWS_) and _Murakami Wolf Dublin_ (_MWD_) during earlier\nseasons), and syndicated by [Group W](/wiki/Westinghouse_Broadcasting\n\"Westinghouse Broadcasting\").
