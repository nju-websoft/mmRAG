The exception, a\nlarge knoll ranking 13th, is Harrow on the Hill. The lowest two of the six\nridges, with one peak over one hundred metres each, are Shooters Hill on the\nrelatively small [Blackheath ridge](/wiki/Blackheath,_London \"Blackheath,\nLondon\"), and Orange Tree Hill in the heart of the old village of [Havering-\natte-Bower](/wiki/Havering-atte-Bower \"Havering-atte-Bower\"), between\nBrentwood and Chigwell, one of several in the [North Weald](/wiki/North_Weald\n\"North Weald\") Ridges and Valleys landscape.
