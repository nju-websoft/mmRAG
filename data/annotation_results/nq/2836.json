The book, _[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's\nStone](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone \"Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher's Stone\")_, was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it\nwas discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a\npositive review. Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \"the\nrubbish title\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling's work, he\nbegan the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises\nof all time.[11]\n\nHeyman's enthusiasm led to Rowling's 1999 sale of the film rights for the\nfirst four _Harry Potter_ books to Warner Bros. for a reported\n[£](/wiki/British_pound \"British pound\")1 million (US$2,000,000).[12] A demand\nRowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, allowing\nnevertheless for the inclusion of many Irish actors, such as [Richard\nHarris](/wiki/Richard_Harris \"Richard Harris\") as Dumbledore, and for casting\nof French and Eastern European actors in _[Harry Potter and the Goblet of\nFire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire \"Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire\")_ where characters from the book are specified as such.[13] Rowling\nwas hesitant to sell the rights because she \"didn't want to give them control\nover the rest of the story\" by selling the rights to the characters, which\nwould have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.[14]\n\nAlthough [Steven Spielberg](/wiki/Steven_Spielberg \"Steven Spielberg\")\ninitially negotiated to direct the first film, he declined the offer.[15]\nSpielberg wanted the adaptation to be an [animated film](/wiki/Animated_film\n\"Animated film\"), with American actor [Haley Joel\nOsment](/wiki/Haley_Joel_Osment \"Haley Joel Osment\") providing Harry Potter's\nvoice.[16] Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, there was every\nexpectation of profit in making the film. He claims that making money would\nhave been like \"shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just\nlike withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank\naccounts. There's no challenge\".[17] In the \"Rubbish\" Bin section of her\nwebsite, Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the\nfilms, writing \"Anyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' him\n[Spielberg] needs their [Quick-Quotes Quill](/wiki/Quick-Quotes_Quill \"Quick-\nQuotes Quill\") serviced.\"[18]\n\nAfter Spielberg left, conversations began with other directors, including\n[Chris Columbus](/wiki/Chris_Columbus_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Chris Columbus\n\\(filmmaker\\)\"), [Jonathan Demme](/wiki/Jonathan_Demme \"Jonathan Demme\"),\n[Terry Gilliam](/wiki/Terry_Gilliam#Gilliam_and_Harry_Potter \"Terry Gilliam\"),\n[Mike Newell](/wiki/Mike_Newell_\\(director\\) \"Mike Newell \\(director\\)\"),\n[Alan Parker](/wiki/Alan_Parker \"Alan Parker\"), [Wolfgang\nPetersen](/wiki/Wolfgang_Petersen \"Wolfgang Petersen\"), [Rob\nReiner](/wiki/Rob_Reiner \"Rob Reiner\"), [Tim Robbins](/wiki/Tim_Robbins \"Tim\nRobbins\"), [Brad Silberling](/wiki/Brad_Silberling \"Brad Silberling\"), and\n[Peter Weir](/wiki/Peter_Weir \"Peter Weir\").[19] Petersen and Reiner both\npulled out of the running in March 2000.[20] It was then narrowed down to\nColumbus, Gilliam, Parker, and Silberling.[21] Rowling's first choice was\nTerry Gilliam.[22] However, on 28 March 2000 Columbus was appointed as\ndirector of the film, with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films\nsuch as _[Home Alone](/wiki/Home_Alone \"Home Alone\")_ and _[Mrs.\nDoubtfire](/wiki/Mrs._Doubtfire \"Mrs. Doubtfire\")_ as influences for their\ndecision.[23]\n\n> _Harry Potter_ is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes\n> around once in a lifetime. Since the books have generated such a passionate\n> following across the world, it was important to us to find a director that\n> has an affinity for both children and magic. I can't think of anyone more\n> ideally suited for this job than Chris [Columbus].\n>\n> — [Lorenzo di Bonaventura](/wiki/Lorenzo_di_Bonaventura \"Lorenzo di\n> Bonaventura\"), [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\")[23]\n\n[Steve Kloves](/wiki/Steve_Kloves \"Steve Kloves\") was selected to write the\nscreenplay for the first film. He described adapting the book as \"tough\" since\nit did not \"lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books\". Kloves\nwas sent a \"raft\" of synopses of books proposed as film adaptations, with\n_Harry Potter_ being the only one that jumped out at him. He went out and\nbought the book, becoming an instant fan. When speaking to Warner Bros. he\nstated that the film had to be British and true to the characters.[24] David\nHeyman was confirmed to produce the film.[23] Rowling received a large amount\nof creative control for the film, an arrangement that Columbus did not\nmind.[25]\n\nWarner Bros. had initially planned to release the first film over the 4 July\n2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several of the\noriginally proposed directors had withdrawn themselves from contention.\nEventually, due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November\n2001.[26]\n\n### Casting the roles of Harry, Ron, and Hermione\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Daniel_Radcliffe%2C_Emma_Watson_%26_Rupert_Grint_colour.jpg/220px-\nDaniel_Radcliffe%2C_Emma_Watson_%26_Rupert_Grint_colour.jpg)](/wiki/File:Daniel_Radcliffe,_Emma_Watson_%26_Rupert_Grint_colour.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Daniel_Radcliffe,_Emma_Watson_%26_Rupert_Grint_colour.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\n[Daniel Radcliffe](/wiki/Daniel_Radcliffe \"Daniel Radcliffe\"), [Emma\nWatson](/wiki/Emma_Watson \"Emma Watson\"), and [Rupert\nGrint](/wiki/Rupert_Grint \"Rupert Grint\") at the world premiere of _[Harry\nPotter and the Deathly Hallows – Part\n2](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_2 \"Harry Potter\nand the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\")_ in [Trafalgar\nSquare](/wiki/Trafalgar_Square \"Trafalgar Square\"), [London](/wiki/London\n\"London\") on 7 July 2011.\n\nIn 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor [Daniel\nRadcliffe](/wiki/Daniel_Radcliffe \"Daniel Radcliffe\") was discovered by\nproducer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a\ntheatre. In Heyman's own words, \"There sitting behind me was this boy with\nthese big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe. I remember my first impressions: He\nwas curious and funny and so energetic. There was real generosity too, and\nsweetness. But at the same time he was really voracious and with hunger for\nknowledge of whatever kind.\"[11]\n\nRadcliffe had already established himself as an actor in the 1999\n[BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\") television production of _[David\nCopperfield](/wiki/David_Copperfield_\\(novel\\) \"David Copperfield \\(novel\\)\")_\nin which he played the title role's childhood years. Heyman persuaded\nRadcliffe's parents to allow him to audition for the part of [Harry\nPotter](/wiki/Harry_Potter_\\(character\\) \"Harry Potter \\(character\\)\"), which\ninvolved Radcliffe being filmed.[11] (This [screen test](/wiki/Screen_test\n\"Screen test\") footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in\n2009.)[27] Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe's filmed test,\nsaying she didn't think there was a better choice for the part of Harry\nPotter.[11][28]\n\nAlso in 2000, the then unknown British actors [Emma Watson](/wiki/Emma_Watson\n\"Emma Watson\") and [Rupert Grint](/wiki/Rupert_Grint \"Rupert Grint\") were\nselected from thousands of auditioning children to play the roles of [Hermione\nGranger](/wiki/Hermione_Granger \"Hermione Granger\") and [Ron\nWeasley](/wiki/Ron_Weasley \"Ron Weasley\"), respectively. Their only previous\nacting experience was in school plays. Grint was eleven years old and Watson\nten at the time they were cast.[29]\n\n_[Los Angeles Times](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles Times\")_ writer\nGeoff Boucher, who conducted the above-mentioned interview with Heyman, added\nthat the casting of the three major roles \"is especially impressive in\nhindsight. The trio's selection was arguably one of the best show-business\ndecisions over the past decade... they have shown admirable grace and\nsteadiness in the face of teen superstardom.\"[11][28]\n\n## Production\n\nFilming of the series began at [Leavesden\nStudios](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Studios,_Leavesden \"Warner Bros. Studios,\nLeavesden\"), Hertfordshire, England, in September 2000 and ended in December\n2010, with post-production on the final film lasting until summer 2011.[6]\nLeavesden Studios was the main base for filming _Harry Potter_ , and it opened\nto the public as a studio tour in 2012 (renamed as Warner Bros.

Barron was later appointed producer on the last four films. Chris\nColumbus was an executive producer on the first two films alongside Mark\nRadcliffe and [Michael Barnathan](/wiki/Michael_Barnathan \"Michael\nBarnathan\"), but he became a producer on the third film alongside Heyman and\nRadcliffe. Other executive producers include [Tanya\nSeghatchian](/wiki/Tanya_Seghatchian \"Tanya Seghatchian\") and [Lionel\nWigram](/wiki/Lionel_Wigram_\\(cinema\\) \"Lionel Wigram \\(cinema\\)\"). J. K.\nRowling, author of the series, was asked to become a producer on _Goblet of\nFire_ but declined. She subsequently accepted the role on the two-part\n_Deathly Hallows_.[31]\n\nHeyday Films and Columbus' company [1492 Pictures](/wiki/1492_Pictures \"1492\nPictures\") collaborated with Duncan Henderson Productions in 2001, Miracle\nProductions in 2002, and P of A Productions in 2004. Even though _Prisoner of\nAzkaban_ was the final film produced by 1492 Pictures, Heyday Films continued\nwith the franchise and collaborated with Patalex IV Productions in 2005. The\nsixth film in the series, _Half-Blood Prince_ , was the most expensive film to\nproduce as of\n2009[[update]](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_\\(film_series\\)&action=edit).\n\n[Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. \"Warner Bros.\") split the seventh and final\nnovel in the series, _Deathly Hallows_ , into two cinematic parts. The two\nparts were filmed back-to-back from early 2009 to summer 2010, with the\ncompletion of reshoots taking place on 21 December 2010; this marked the end\nof filming _Harry Potter_. Heyman stated that _Deathly Hallows_ was \"[shot as\none film](/wiki/Production_of_Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Production\nof Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\")\" but released in two feature-length\nparts.[32]\n\nTim Burke, the visual effects supervisor of the series, said of the production\non _Harry Potter_ , \"It was this huge family; I think there were over 700\npeople working at Leavesden, an industry in itself.\" David Heyman said, \"When\nthe first film opened, no way did I think we'd make eight films. That didn't\nseem feasible until after we'd done the fourth.\" Nisha Parti, the production\nconsultant on the first film, said that Heyman \"made the first film very much\nthe way he felt the studio Warner Bros. wanted to make it.\" After the film's\nsuccess, Heyman was given \"more freedom\".[33]\n\nOne of the aims of the filmmakers from the beginning of production was to\ndevelop the maturity of the films. Chris Columbus stated, \"We realised that\nthese movies would get progressively darker. Again, we didn't know _how_ dark\nbut we realised that as the kids get older, the movies get a little edgier and\ndarker.\"[34] This transpired with the succeeding three directors who would\nwork on the series in the following years, with the films beginning to deal\nwith issues such as death, betrayal, prejudice, and political corruption as\nthe series developed narratively and thematically.[5][35]\n\n### Directors\n\nAfter [Chris Columbus](/wiki/Chris_Columbus_\\(filmmaker\\) \"Chris Columbus\n\\(filmmaker\\)\") had finished working on _Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's\nStone_, he was hired to direct the second film, _Harry Potter and the Chamber\nof Secrets_. The production started within a week after the release of the\nfirst film. Columbus was set to direct all entries in the series,[36] but he\ndid not want to return for the third film, _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of\nAzkaban_ , claiming he was \"burned out\".[37] He moved to the position of\nproducer, while [Alfonso Cuarón](/wiki/Alfonso_Cuar%C3%B3n \"Alfonso Cuarón\")\nwas approached for the role of director.

But he expressed real passion.\"[33]\nProducer Tanya Seghatchian said they were \"more adventurous\" in choosing a\ndirector for the third film and went straight to Alfonso Cuarón.[33] Mike\nNewell became the first British director of the series when he was chosen for\nthe fourth film; Newell was considered to direct the first film before he\ndropped out.[33] David Yates directed the final films after David Heyman\nthought him capable of handling the edgy, emotional, and political material of\nthe later novels.[43]\n\nAll the directors have been supportive of each other.

Rowling asked Kloves to remain faithful to the spirit\nof the books; thus, the plot and tone of each film and its corresponding book\nare virtually the same, albeit with some changes and omissions for purposes of\ncinematic style, time, and budget constraints. Michael Goldenberg also\nreceived input from Rowling during his adaptation of the fifth novel;\nGoldenberg was originally considered to adapt the first novel before the\nstudio chose Kloves.[45]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Hogwarts_model_studio_tour.jpg/220px-\nHogwarts_model_studio_tour.jpg)](/wiki/File:Hogwarts_model_studio_tour.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Hogwarts_model_studio_tour.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA studio model of [Hogwarts](/wiki/Hogwarts \"Hogwarts\"). It is the main\nsetting in the series; the castle features in every novel and screen\nadaptation.\n\nIn a 2010 interview, David Heyman briefly explained the book-to-film\ntransition. He commented on Rowling's involvement in the series, stating that\nshe understood that \"books and films are different\" and was \"the best support\"\na producer could have. Rowling had overall approval on the scripts, which were\nviewed and discussed by the director and the producers. Heyman also said that\nKloves was the \"key voice\" in the process of adapting the novels and that\ncertain aspects from the books needed to have been excluded from the scripts\ndue to the filmmakers' decision to keep the main focus on Harry's journey as a\ncharacter, which would ultimately give the films a defined structure. Heyman\nmentioned that some fans \"don't necessarily understand the adaptation process\"\nand that the filmmakers would have loved to \"have everything\" from the books\nin the films but noted that it was not possible since they had \"neither time\nnor cinematic structure\" to do so. He finished by saying that adapting a novel\nto the screen is \"a really considered process.\"[46]\n\nBecause the films were being made as the novels were being published, the\nfilmmakers had no idea of the story's outcome until the release of the final\nnovel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his relationship with Rowling when adapting the\nnovels by saying, \"The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who\nhad no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a\nconversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies\ncan't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to\nfully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be\ntrue to the characters; that's all I care about.'\"[47] Kloves also said, \"I\ndon't know what compelled me to say this [to Rowling], but I said, 'I've just\ngot to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is\nHermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of\ntrusted me.\"[47]\n\n### Cast and crew\n\nSee also: [List of Harry Potter cast\nmembers](/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_cast_members \"List of Harry Potter cast\nmembers\")\n\nAside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include [Robbie\nColtrane](/wiki/Robbie_Coltrane \"Robbie Coltrane\") as [Rubeus\nHagrid](/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid \"Rubeus Hagrid\"), [Tom Felton](/wiki/Tom_Felton\n\"Tom Felton\") as [Draco Malfoy](/wiki/Draco_Malfoy \"Draco Malfoy\"), [Alan\nRickman](/wiki/Alan_Rickman \"Alan Rickman\") as [Severus\nSnape](/wiki/Severus_Snape \"Severus Snape\"), and [Dame Maggie\nSmith](/wiki/Maggie_Smith \"Maggie Smith\") as [Minerva\nMcGonagall](/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall \"Minerva McGonagall\").

Assisted by [Stephenie\nMcMillan](/wiki/Stephenie_McMillan \"Stephenie McMillan\"), Craig has created\niconic sets pieces including the [Ministry of Magic](/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic\n\"Ministry of Magic\"), the [Chamber of Secrets](/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets\n\"Chamber of Secrets\"), [Malfoy Manor](/wiki/Malfoy_Manor \"Malfoy Manor\"), and\nthe layout for the CGI [Horcrux\nCave](/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Horcruxes \"Magical objects in\nHarry Potter\"). Because the novels were being published as the films were\nbeing made, Craig was required to rebuild some sets for future films and alter\nthe design of Hogwarts.[50]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/The_Great_Hall%2C_Hogwarts.jpg/220px-\nThe_Great_Hall%2C_Hogwarts.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Great_Hall,_Hogwarts.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:The_Great_Hall,_Hogwarts.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe studio film set of The Great Hall of Hogwarts was one of the first sets\never created for the series.[51]\n\nHe said, \"In the early days, every time you saw the exterior of Hogwarts, it\nwas a physical miniature,\" which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large\nsound stage.[52][53] \"We ended up with a profile of how Hogwarts looked, a\nskyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and\nas all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements\n[for buildings]. The [Astronomy Tower] definitely wasn't there originally, and\nso we were able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed\nan arena for the battle for Hogwarts – the big courtyard outside doubled in\nsize, and if you look at the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were\nquite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts.\"[54] In the last\nfilm, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to \"embrace the latest\ntechnology\".[53]\n\nOn the method of creating the sets, Craig said he often started by sketching\nideas onto a blank sheet of paper.[55] Stephanie McMillan also said that \"each\nfilm always had plenty of new challenges,\" citing the changes in visual style\nbetween directors and cinematographers as an example, along with the\ndeveloping story in the novels. Due to J.K. Rowling's descriptions of various\nsettings in the novels, Craig noted his \"responsibility was to place it\ntogether\".[56]\n\nCraig commented on his experience working in the studio environment: \"I'm the\nproduction designer, but on a big movie like _Harry Potter_ I may be\nresponsible for 30 to 35 people; from the supervising art director, and a team\nof art directors and assistants, to draughtsmen and junior draughtsmen, and\nthen on to model makers, sculptors and scenic artists.\" He said, \"Ten years\nago, all the _Harry Potter_ drawings were done in pencil. I would take my\nroughs and plans and sections and give them to a professional architectural\nillustrator, who would create concept art using pencil and colour wash on\nwatercolour paper.\" He said the process changed slightly throughout the years\ndue to, what he called, the \"digital revolution\" of making films.[53]\n\nWhen filming of the series was completed, some of Craig's sets had to be\nrebuilt or transported for them to be displayed at the Warner Bros. studio\ntour.[52]\n\n### Cinematography\n\nSix [directors of photography](/wiki/Cinematographer \"Cinematographer\") worked\non the series: [John Seale](/wiki/John_Seale \"John Seale\") on the first film,\n[Roger Pratt](/wiki/Roger_Pratt_\\(cinematographer\\) \"Roger Pratt\n\\(cinematographer\\)\") on the second and fourth, [Michael\nSeresin](/wiki/Michael_Seresin \"Michael Seresin\") on the third, [Sławomir\nIdziak](/wiki/S%C5%82awomir_Idziak \"Sławomir Idziak\") on the fifth, [Bruno\nDelbonnel](/wiki/Bruno_Delbonnel \"Bruno Delbonnel\") on the sixth, and [Eduardo\nSerra](/wiki/Eduardo_Serra \"Eduardo Serra\") on the seventh and eighth.\nDelbonnel was considered to return for both parts of _Deathly Hallows_ , but\nhe declined, stating that he was \"scared of repeating\" himself.[57]\nDelbonnel's cinematography in _Half-Blood Prince_ gained the series its only\n[Academy Award](/wiki/Academy_Award \"Academy Award\") nomination for [Best\nCinematography](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography \"Academy Award for\nBest Cinematography\"). As the series progressed, each cinematographer faced\nthe challenge of shooting and lighting older sets (which had been around since\nthe first few films) in unique and different ways.[58] Chris Columbus said the\nseries' vivid colouring decreased as each film was made.[34][59]\n\nMichael Seresin commented on the change of visual style from the first two\nfilms to _Prisoner of Azkaban_ : \"The lighting is moodier, with more shadowing\nand cross-lighting.\" Seresin and Alfonso Cuarón moved away from the strongly\ncoloured and brightly lit cinematography of the first two films, with dimmer\nlighting and a more muted colour palette being utilised for the succeeding\nfive films.[60] After comparing a range of digital cameras with 35 mm film,\nBruno Delbonnel decided to shoot the sixth movie, _Half-Blood Prince_ , on\n[film](/wiki/Film_stock \"Film stock\") rather than the increasingly popular\n[digital](/wiki/Digital_cinematography \"Digital cinematography\") format. This\ndecision was kept for the two-part _Deathly Hallows_ with Eduardo Serra, who\nsaid that he preferred to work with film because it was \"more technically\naccurate and dependable\".[61]\n\nBecause the majority of _Deathly Hallows_ takes place in various settings away\nfrom Hogwarts, David Yates wanted to \"shake things up\" by using different\nphotographic techniques such as using hand-held cameras and very wide camera\nlenses.[62] Eduardo Serra said, \"Sometimes we are combining elements shot by\nthe main unit, a second unit, and the visual effects unit. You have to know\nwhat is being captured – colours, contrast, et cetera – with mathematical\nprecision.\" He noted that with Stuart Craig's \"amazing sets and the story\",\nthe filmmakers could not \"stray too far from the look of the previous _Harry\nPotter_ films.\"[61][63]\n\n### Editing\n\nAlong with continuous changes in cinematographers, there have been five [film\neditors](/wiki/Film_editing \"Film editing\") to work in post-production on the\nseries: [Richard Francis-Bruce](/wiki/Richard_Francis-Bruce \"Richard Francis-\nBruce\") edited the first instalment, [Peter Honess](/wiki/Peter_Honess \"Peter\nHoness\") the second, [Steven Weisberg](/wiki/Steven_Weisberg \"Steven\nWeisberg\") the third, [Mick Audsley](/wiki/Mick_Audsley \"Mick Audsley\") the\nfourth, and [Mark Day](/wiki/Mark_Day_\\(editor\\) \"Mark Day \\(editor\\)\") films\nfive through eight.\n\n### Music\n\nSee also: [Music of the Harry Potter\nfilms](/wiki/Music_of_the_Harry_Potter_films \"Music of the Harry Potter\nfilms\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/John_Williams_tux.jpg/170px-\nJohn_Williams_tux.jpg)](/wiki/File:John_Williams_tux.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:John_Williams_tux.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[John Williams](/wiki/John_Williams \"John Williams\") scored the first three\nfilms and received [Academy Award](/wiki/Academy_Awards \"Academy Awards\")\nnominations for the first and third films.\n\nThe _Harry Potter_ series has had four composers.

However, the second\nentry was adapted and conducted by [William\nRoss](/wiki/William_Ross_\\(composer\\) \"William Ross \\(composer\\)\") due to\nWilliams's conflicting commitments. Williams also created _Hedwig 's Theme_,\nwhich is used in every film in the series.\n\nAfter Williams left the series to pursue other projects, [Patrick\nDoyle](/wiki/Patrick_Doyle \"Patrick Doyle\") scored the fourth entry, _[Goblet\nof Fire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Harry\nPotter and the Goblet of Fire \\(soundtrack\\)\")_ , which was directed by [Mike\nNewell](/wiki/Mike_Newell_\\(director\\) \"Mike Newell \\(director\\)\"), with whom\nDoyle had worked previously. In 2006, [Nicholas Hooper](/wiki/Nicholas_Hooper\n\"Nicholas Hooper\") started work on the score to _[Order of the\nPhoenix](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Harry\nPotter and the Order of the Phoenix \\(soundtrack\\)\")_ by reuniting with\ndirector [David Yates](/wiki/David_Yates \"David Yates\"). Hooper also composed\nthe soundtrack to _[Half-Blood Prince](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-\nBlood_Prince_\\(soundtrack\\) \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\\(soundtrack\\)\")_ but decided not to return for the final films.\n\nIn January 2010, [Alexandre Desplat](/wiki/Alexandre_Desplat \"Alexandre\nDesplat\") was confirmed to compose the score for _[Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows – Part\n1](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_1_\\(soundtrack\\)\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 \\(soundtrack\\)\")_.[64] The\nfilm's orchestration started in the summer with [Conrad\nPope](/wiki/Conrad_Pope \"Conrad Pope\"), the orchestrator on the first three\n_Harry Potter_ films, collaborating with Desplat.

The latter three have worked on all the films in\nthe series, while Double Negative and Rising Sun Pictures began their\ncommitments with _Prisoner of Azkaban_ and _Goblet of Fire_ , respectively.\nFramestore contributed by developing many memorable creatures and sequences to\nthe series.[69] Cinesite was involved in producing both miniature and digital\neffects for the films.[70] Producer [David\nBarron](/wiki/David_Barron_\\(film_producer\\) \"David Barron \\(film producer\\)\")\nsaid that \"_Harry Potter_ created the UK effects industry as we know it. On\nthe first film, all the complicated visual effects were done on the [US] west\ncoast.

and influence\n\n\"_Harry Potter_ was in the vanguard of a new approach to big-budget film-\nmaking. Most modern blockbuster franchises have two things in common: they are\nbased on known properties such as books and comics, and they are steered by\nrespected but little-known directors.\"\n\n— _[The Economist](/wiki/The_Economist \"The Economist\")_[150]\n\nThe _Harry Potter_ films and their success have been retrospectively\nconsidered to have had a significant impact on the [film\nindustry](/wiki/Film_industry \"Film industry\"). They are cited as having\nhelped redefine the [Hollywood\nblockbuster](/wiki/Blockbuster_\\(entertainment\\) \"Blockbuster\n\\(entertainment\\)\") in the 21st century by initiating a shift toward\nestablished [media franchises](/wiki/Media_franchise \"Media franchise\")\nforming the basis of successful films. In the wake of the final film's\nrelease, Claudia Puig of _[USA Today](/wiki/USA_Today \"USA Today\")_ wrote that\nthe films \"inspired every major studio to try to capture [its] alchemic\nformula, spawning a range of copycats and wannabes\" and \"also have shown\nHollywood how to make a glossy blockbuster with an eye toward keeping costs\ndown.\"[151] A 2009 article from _[The Economist](/wiki/The_Economist \"The\nEconomist\")_ argued that the films were \"in the vanguard\" of adaptations of\nestablished properties being the modern film franchise model, citing _[The\nLord of the Rings](/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_\\(film_series\\) \"The Lord of\nthe Rings \\(film series\\)\")_ , _[Spider-Man](/wiki/Spider-\nMan_in_film#Sam_Raimi_films \"Spider-Man in film\")_ and _[The Dark Knight\nTrilogy](/wiki/Batman_in_film#Christopher_Nolan \"Batman in film\")_ as examples\nof successful film series that followed _Harry Potter_ 's suit.[150]\nFurthermore, the practice of splitting the finale of a film series into two\n[back-to-back films](/wiki/Back_to_back_film_production \"Back to back film\nproduction\") began with the success of _[Deathly\nHallows](/wiki/Production_of_Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows \"Production\nof Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\")_ , and it would soon be replicated\nby _[The Hobbit: The Desolation of\nSmaug](/wiki/The_Hobbit:_The_Desolation_of_Smaug \"The Hobbit: The Desolation\nof Smaug\")_ and _[The Battle of the Five\nArmies](/wiki/The_Hobbit:_The_Battle_of_the_Five_Armies \"The Hobbit: The\nBattle of the Five Armies\")_ , _[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Parts\n1](/wiki/The_Twilight_Saga:_Breaking_Dawn_%E2%80%93_Part_1 \"The Twilight Saga:\nBreaking Dawn – Part 1\")_ and\n_[2](/wiki/The_Twilight_Saga:_Breaking_Dawn_%E2%80%93_Part_2 \"The Twilight\nSaga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2\")_ , _[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Parts\n1](/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_Mockingjay_%E2%80%93_Part_1 \"The Hunger Games:\nMockingjay – Part 1\")_ and\n_[2](/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_Mockingjay_%E2%80%93_Part_2 \"The Hunger Games:\nMockingjay – Part 2\")_ , and _[Avengers: Infinity\nWar](/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War \"Avengers: Infinity War\")_ and its [untitled\nsequel](/wiki/Untitled_Avengers_film \"Untitled Avengers film\").[152]\n\nThe films are also widely credited with singlehandedly signalling the\npopularity of films based on [children's](/wiki/Children%27s_literature\n\"Children's literature\") and [young adult\nliterature](/wiki/Young_adult_fiction \"Young adult fiction\") in the 2000s and\n2010s, correlating with the book series' own literary influence. Costance\nGrady and Aja Romano, commenting on the whole _Harry Potter_ franchise's\nlegacy for _[Vox](/wiki/Vox_\\(website\\) \"Vox \\(website\\)\")_ in light of its\n20th anniversary, wrote that youth-targeted literature has since become \"a go-\nto well of ideas for Hollywood,\" pointing to the successes of _[The Twilight\nSaga](/wiki/The_Twilight_Saga_\\(film_series\\) \"The Twilight Saga \\(film\nseries\\)\")_ , _[The Hunger Games](/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_\\(film_series\\) \"The\nHunger Games \\(film series\\)\")_ and _[The Divergent\nSeries](/wiki/The_Divergent_Series \"The Divergent Series\")_.[153]\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Not including executive producers.\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Kois, Dan. \"[The Real Wizard Behind Harry Potter](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/07/the_real_wizard_behind_harry_potter.html)\" _[Slate (magazine)](/wiki/Slate_\\(magazine\\) \"Slate \\(magazine\\)\")_ , 13 July 2011.
