While\nexploring the ruins, Klaus finds a broken spyglass with an insignia of an eye\nembedded on the front. Shortly afterwards, they are sent to live with their\ndistant relative Count Olaf, a cruel and vain amateur actor, who forces them\ninto servitude.

While attempting to learn more about Montgomery, Klaus discovers\nthat the hedge maze in Montgomery's garden is exactly the same shape as the\ntattoo on Olaf's ankle. Olaf poses as Montgomery's new assistant Stephano and\nattempts to kidnap the Baudelaires, but Monty assures the Baudelaires that he\nrecognizes Stephano as a threat. The four arrive at a movie theatre, where\nMonty deciphers a code sent for him through the subtitles of the film, using a\nspyglass identical to Klaus'. The message instructs him to bring the children\nto Peru.

While searching for proof of the snake's innocence, Klaus\ndiscovers a statue in Monty's hedge maze, and a photograph of Monty, both of\nthem carrying spyglasses identical to Klaus'. Violet proves Olaf to be the\nmurderer; however, he escapes via the hedge maze with Klaus' spyglass. While\npursuing him, the Baudelaires meet Jacquelyn, who is posing as a statue.

She refuses to answer questions about their parents, so the\nsiblings pursue answers themselves around her house, and discover their\nparents were members of a secret organization, with spyglasses being used as\nuseful devices. They are also shocked to find out that Josephine was once\nfierce and formidable, and developed her phobias after the death of her\nhusband. Olaf, who has followed the Baudelaires, disguises himself as a sailor\nnamed Captain Sham before pretending to fall in love with Josephine. Despite\nthe siblings' warnings, Josephine accepts his invitation to take her out for a\nfried egg sandwich. Later that night, the siblings discover that Josephine has\njumped out the library's bay window and left a note informing them that\n\"Captain Sham\" is their new guardian.  \n6 | 6 | \"The Wide Window: Part Two\" | Barry Sonnenfeld | Daniel Handler | January 13, 2017 (2017-01-13)  \nAs Mr. Poe prepares to hand the Baudelaires over to \"Captain Sham,\" the\nsiblings discover the note has several grammatical errors, something Josephine\nwould never do since she was obsessed with proper grammar. Mr. Poe takes the\nchildren to a restaurant and prepares to complete the transfer, but allows the\nsiblings to leave after Larry, a waiter secretly a member of their parents'\norganization, triggers their allergy to peppermint. After returning to the\nhouse, the siblings decipher Josephine's suicide note and discover she is\nstill alive moments before a hurricane sends the house teetering over the\ncliff. Escaping with a photograph of their parents standing in front of a\nlumber mill, the siblings find Josephine at a nearby cave, only to be\nconfronted by Olaf, who abandons Josephine to be eaten alive by the leeches\nthat inhabit Lake Lachrymose.

The workers then storm the mill, causing Orwell to\nfall into the furnace and die. Sir, Olaf, and the Hook-Handed Man all escape\nin the chaos. Charles reveals the truth about the Baudelaires' role in the\ntown, where they actually helped to fight the fire. The three siblings are\nreunited with Mr. Poe, and Jacquelyn sends Klaus the broken spyglass that Olaf\nstole from him. Poe then sends the three siblings to a dreary boarding school,\nwhich two of the three Quagmire siblings are also sent to, due to their house\nbeing burnt down by an unknown woman.

The\nschool's only redeeming qualities are its friendly librarian, Olivia Caliban,\nand the surviving Quagmire triplets, Duncan and Isadora. During a lunch break,\nKlaus and Isadora discover that they are holding two halves of the same\nspyglass. The newfound friends quickly realize that they must track down a\nbook on secret organizations to find the answers they seek—a book Jacquelyn\nsent Larry to give them, but which he carelessly misplaced. Meanwhile, Count\nOlaf and his troupe lurk around the grounds of the school, unable to enter the\nfront doors due to an advanced computer system programmed by Nero to detect\nOlaf's presence. However, with Carmelita's help, Olaf finally gains entry and\nlocks Larry in the cafeteria's walk-in refrigerator. He then dons his latest\ndisguise: the school's new turban-wearing gym teacher.  \n10 | 2 | \"The Austere Academy: Part 2\" | Barry Sonnenfeld | Joe Tracz | March 30, 2018 (2018-03-30)  \nOlaf is able to convince Nero to put the Baudelaires under a grueling exercise\nprogram, making the siblings run endless laps at night to prevent them from\nscheming against him, while also causing them to perform poorly in class from\nlack of sleep. Due to their slumping grades, Nero threatens to expel the\nBaudelaires if they fail a comprehensive exam to be given in front of the\nentire school, but because they must still exercise under Olaf's program, they\nknow they will likely fail. The Quagmires offer to help, and that night take\ntheir place during exercises; however, their identity is discovered, and while\nhiding in the library, they find the copy of the book on secret organizations\nand read up on the purpose of the spyglass before they are caught by the Hook-\nHanded Man. The next day, with Mr. Poe in attendance, the Baudelaires readily\npass the exam, and through it reveal Olaf's identity. Olaf and his gang then\nescape with the Quagmires, who try to shout the initials \"V.F.D.\" from the\nbackseat of Olaf's car. Meanwhile, Larry is rescued from the refrigerator with\nthe help of Lemony's brother, Jacques, while Olivia walks off with the book on\nsecret organizations that the Quagmires left behind.  \n11 | 3 | \"The Ersatz Elevator: Part 1\" | [Bo Welch](/wiki/Bo_Welch \"Bo Welch\") | Daniel Handler | March 30, 2018 (2018-03-30)  \nWhile a citywide manhunt for Count Olaf is underway, Mr. Poe takes the\nBaudelaires to the penthouse of Jerome Squalor and his trendy financial\nadvisor wife Esmé. While being introduced to the Squalors, they find Olaf has\nalready arrived, posing as a foreign auctioneer named Gunther. The Baudelaires\ntheorize that Olaf is trying to kill Jerome so that he can marry Esmé and\nbecome their legal guardian again. They search the penthouse for the Quagmires\nto no avail, but Klaus becomes suspicious of an extra elevator that only seems\nto serve the penthouse. Meanwhile, Olivia tries to convince Mr. Poe about\nOlaf's scheme, which leads Jacquelyn to contact Jacques, who enlists her into\ntheir society. Esmé suggests they go out for lunch at a fashionable salmon-\nthemed restaurant, where Larry works to prolong their visit, giving Jacques\nand Olivia time to search the Squalor's building for the Quagmires. When the\nBaudelaires manage to sneak away and examine the second elevator, they learn\nthat it is merely an empty shaft. With a makeshift parachute, they descend it\nto find the Quagmires locked in a cage at its bottom.  \n12 | 4 | \"The Ersatz Elevator: Part 2\" | Bo Welch | Daniel Handler | March 30, 2018 (2018-03-30)  \n|  ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png) |  This episode's plot summary **may be[too long](/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary#What_to_cut \"Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary\") or [excessively detailed](/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_plot_summary \"Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary\").** Please [help improve it](//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events_\\(TV_series\\)&action=edit) by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. _(April 2018)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this template message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal \"Help:Maintenance template removal\"))_  \n---|---  \nThe Baudelaires do not have the tools to free the Quagmires, so they ascend\nthe shaft by turning the parachute into a hot-air balloon. Finding Esmé alone\nand Jerome drugged, the Baudelaires try to warn her of Olaf's scheme, but\nlearn too late that she is in cahoots with him and that they are planning to\nsmuggle the Quagmires out of the city as an item in an upcoming auction. Esmé\npushes them down the elevator shaft, where they are caught in a net midway\ndown. Sunny helps them to escape safely, and afterwards they find a secret\npassage that leads to the ashen ruins of their home. As Esmé and Olaf start\nthe auction, the Baudelaires, the Poes, and the secret society's volunteers\nconverge on Veblen Hall and start a bidding war on a box labeled \"V.F.D.\",\nwhich the Baudelaires believe contains the Quagmires. Though the Baudelaires\nwin the auction, they find the box contains only very fancy\n[doilies](/wiki/Doilies \"Doilies\"). In the aftermath, Olaf and his troupe\nescape with a [red herring](/wiki/Red_herring \"Red herring\") statue—the real\nauction item that holds the Quagmires. The Baudelaires ask Jerome to help\ntrack down Olaf, but he is far too timid to do so, and gives up his\nguardianship of them. Mr. Poe tells the children that a village with the\ninitials \"V.F.D.\" is willing to raise them.  \n13 | 5 | \"The Vile Village: Part 1\" | Barry Sonnenfeld | Sigrid Gilmer | March 30, 2018 (2018-03-30)  \nMr. Poe drops the Baudelaires off at the Village of Fowl Devotees, where the\nwhole community will care for them collectively (in reality, they just want\nthe children to do all their chores). The Baudelaires take up residence with\nHector, a kindly handyman prone to fainting spells who is secretly building a\nself-sustaining hot-air mobile home, and soon begin finding clues written by\nthe Quagmires themselves. Olaf, Esmé, and the troupe also arrive at the\nvillage, with Esmé disguising herself as the town's new chief of police.\nJacques and Olivia also arrive and detain Olaf at the local jailhouse; the\nnext day, the villagers learn of Olaf's capture and hold a town hall meeting,\nwhere Olaf appears in the disguise of Detective Dupin, tricking everyone into\nbelieving Jacques is Olaf. Jacques is sentenced to death, but Olivia convinces\nEsmé to free her and Jacques in exchange for the location of the Sugar Bowl,\nan object with ties to Esmé's past. Jacques stays behind to confront Olaf;\nhowever, the villain is unfazed by Jacques' offer of a truce, and he and Esmé\nincapacitate and kill him.

While in jail, the children instruct Hector to prepare\nhis hot-air mobile home to help them escape. While Violet creates a battering\nram to weaken the jail wall, Klaus deduces from their clues that the Quagmires\nare hidden inside a crow fountain in the village square. Larry and Jacquelyn\narrive on the scene to distract the villagers long enough for the children to\nescape via a fire truck and follow Hector. The Baudelaires cover for the\nQuagmires as they use the truck's ladder to climb aboard the mobile home. As\nthey do so, Olaf, Esmé, and the villagers arrive, and Esmé begins damaging\nHector's home with a harpoon gun. Realizing their danger, the Baudelaires tell\nHector to escape with the Quagmires. In thanks, the Quagmires try to throw\ntheir friends their notes about the secrets of V.F.D., but Esmé shoots them\nwith a harpoon, scattering the pages and harming a crow. While the villagers\naccost the villains over the injured bird, the Baudelaires collect as many of\nthe ruined pages as they can and make their escape.  \n15 | 7 | \"The Hostile Hospital: Part 1\" | Alan Arkush | Joshua Conkel | March 30, 2018 (2018-03-30)  \nThe Baudelaires hitch a ride with [volunteer singing candy\nstripers](/wiki/Hospital_volunteer \"Hospital volunteer\") heading to Heimlich\nHospital. They learn that there is a Library of Records that collects and\nstores esoterica. After sneaking past the hospital's administrator, they meet\nHal, the man who runs the library. He welcomes their help, but forbids them to\nread material in storage. While Hal shows them the ropes, a film reel labeled\n\"Snicket\" arrives and catches the children's attention. Meanwhile, believing\nthe Sugar Bowl to be in the hospital, Olaf and his troupe infiltrate the\nbuilding. Desperate for answers, the children are forced to steal Hal's keys\nto access the library, where they find the film. It contains a debriefing of\nJacques by a V.F.D. volunteer, with Jacques informing the interviewer that\nsomeone has survived a fire, which may or may not be the one that killed the\nBaudelaire's parents. However, before they can watch any further, they are\ninterrupted by Esmé; as they try to escape, the library is ruined.

To find\nViolet, Klaus disguises himself as \"Dr. Faustus,\" with Sunny hidden in a sling\nunderneath his coat. They eventually find the patient list and deduce which\nroom Violet is in, but this is a trap laid by Olaf, who forces Klaus to\noperate on Violet inside an operating theater. Esmé promises to call off the\nscheme if Klaus can give her what he stole from the Library of Records, and he\ndoes so—only, it's not the Sugar Bowl that she has been searching for. Olaf,\nhowever, is interested in the Snicket film, and dashes off to watch it to\nlearn its secret. Furious at its revelations, he burns the film, which also\nstarts a fire in the hospital. He then convinces everyone that the Baudelaires\nstarted it. The Baudelaires successfully escape the hospital during the mass\nevacuation, and as there are police around, they realize that their only\nchance to escape safely is in the trunk of Olaf's car.

In the present, Olaf and his troupe arrive at the\nCaligari Carnival to speak with Madame Lulu about the fire's survivor. Lulu,\nwho is really Olivia in disguise, tells them to wait for the answer in the\nmorning. The Baudelaires overhear this, and hoping to speak to Lulu as well,\nassume the identities of circus freaks, with Violet and Klaus as a two-headed\nperson and Sunny as a wolf child. After calling V.F.D., Olivia is able to tell\nOlaf the next day that one of the Baudelaire parents did indeed survive the\nfire. Olaf then presents a freak show that proves disastrous, so he sets off\nto find a pack of roaming lions to help attract a larger crowd.

As such, the Snicket books had been optioned to be filmed before they\nwere published.[37] This led to the development of a 2004 feature film,\n_[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate\nEvents](/wiki/Lemony_Snicket%27s_A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events \"Lemony\nSnicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\")_, which covered the narratives of\nthe first three novels in the series. [Barry\nSonnenfeld](/wiki/Barry_Sonnenfeld \"Barry Sonnenfeld\"), who has expressed his\nlove for the series, was originally slated to direct the feature film, and had\nhired Handler to write the screenplay.[38] About 10 months into production,\nshortly after the casting of [Jim Carrey](/wiki/Jim_Carrey \"Jim Carrey\") as\nOlaf, there was a \"big crisis\", according to Handler, which caused producer\n[Scott Rudin](/wiki/Scott_Rudin \"Scott Rudin\") to walk away and Sonnenfeld\nleft the production under unclear terms.[37] With the film's completion in\nflux, its producing studios [Paramount Pictures](/wiki/Paramount_Pictures\n\"Paramount Pictures\") and [DreamWorks](/wiki/DreamWorks \"DreamWorks\") fired\nHandler. While the film was eventually completed and released, sequels which\nwould adapt the other novels in the series became unlikely due to \"corporate\nshakeups\" within DreamWorks, according to Handler, and the child actors that\nportrayed the Baudelaire children grew too old to star in a sequel.[38]\n\nIn November 2014, [Netflix](/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\"), in association with\n[Paramount Television](/wiki/Paramount_Television \"Paramount Television\"),\nannounced its plans to adapt the novels into an original television series,\nwith the author of the series, Daniel Handler, serving as executive\nproducer.[39]\n\nIn September 2015, it was announced that Barry Sonnenfeld and [Mark\nHudis](/wiki/Mark_Hudis \"Mark Hudis\") had agreed to helm the series. Hudis\nwould serve as showrunner, Sonnenfeld as director, and both as executive\nproducers,[40] with Handler writing some of the scripts along with working\nwith the series' writing team.[30] However, in January 2016, Netflix announced\nthat Hudis had left the project, with a replacement showrunner not named at\nthe time.[4]\n\nThe first season consists of eight episodes,[5] with two episodes adapting\neach of the first four books of the series.[27] Handler considered this more\nin line with how he had written the books in the manner of a serialized\nmelodrama, citing _[The Perils of\nPauline](/wiki/The_Perils_of_Pauline_\\(1933_serial\\) \"The Perils of Pauline\n\\(1933 serial\\)\")_ as one of his influences in writing the book series.[41] In\nJanuary 2017, Handler revealed that he was writing the series' second season,\nto consist of ten episodes adapting the fifth through ninth books of the\nseries. A third season would adapt the remaining novels of the series, which\nHandler hoped \"to get the go-ahead to do\" since \"given how quickly young\nactors age and change, we're trying to film everything as quickly as\npossible.\"[30] In March 2017, Netflix revealed the series had been renewed for\na second season by releasing a video on their social media pointing to a viral\nmarketing website, where a letter written by Snicket revealed the\ndecision.[42] A month later, the series was \"quietly\" renewed for a third\nseason,[43] which Harris confirmed would be the final one for the series.[44]\n\n### Casting\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Neil_Patrick_Harris_%289449178210%29.jpg/170px-\nNeil_Patrick_Harris_%289449178210%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Neil_Patrick_Harris_\\(9449178210\\).jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Neil_Patrick_Harris_\\(9449178210\\).jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Neil Patrick Harris](/wiki/Neil_Patrick_Harris \"Neil Patrick Harris\")\nportrays [Count Olaf](/wiki/Count_Olaf \"Count Olaf\") in the series and serves\nas a producer.[4]\n\nOn December 3, 2015, an open casting call was announced for the roles of\nViolet and Klaus Baudelaire.[45] In January 2016, Netflix announced that [Neil\nPatrick Harris](/wiki/Neil_Patrick_Harris \"Neil Patrick Harris\") had been cast\nas [Count Olaf](/wiki/Count_Olaf \"Count Olaf\") and [Malina\nWeissman](/wiki/Malina_Weissman \"Malina Weissman\") and [Louis\nHynes](/wiki/Louis_Hynes \"Louis Hynes\") were cast as Violet and Klaus.[4][6]\nHandler had first considered Harris for the role of Olaf after seeing him\nperform the opening number \"It's Not Just for Gays Anymore\", at the [65th Tony\nAwards](/wiki/65th_Tony_Awards \"65th Tony Awards\") in 2011, noting \"I just\nimmediately saw someone who could pull off a million things at once\" as was\nnecessary for the character of Olaf, who utilizes various disguises and\naccents in his quest to steal the Baudelaire fortune.[46]\n\nIn March 2016, [K. Todd Freeman](/wiki/K._Todd_Freeman \"K. Todd Freeman\") was\ncast as Mr. Poe,[7] followed shortly after by the casting of [Patrick\nWarburton](/wiki/Patrick_Warburton \"Patrick Warburton\") as [Lemony\nSnicket](/wiki/Lemony_Snicket \"Lemony Snicket\"),[5] and [Aasif\nMandvi](/wiki/Aasif_Mandvi \"Aasif Mandvi\") as [Uncle\nMonty](/wiki/Montgomery_Montgomery \"Montgomery Montgomery\").[19] In September\n2016, it was revealed that Dylan Kingwell and Avi Lake were cast as the\n[Quagmire\nsiblings](/wiki/List_of_A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events_characters#Duncan_and_Isadora\n\"List of A Series of Unfortunate Events characters\"), Duncan and Isadora,\nrespectively.[11] In November 2016, Handler revealed [Catherine\nO'Hara](/wiki/Catherine_O%27Hara \"Catherine O'Hara\"), [Don\nJohnson](/wiki/Don_Johnson \"Don Johnson\"), and [Alfre\nWoodard](/wiki/Alfre_Woodard \"Alfre Woodard\") had been cast as Dr. Georgina\nOrwell,[22] Sir,[21] and Aunt Josephine, respectively;[20] O'Hara had\npreviously portrayed Justice Strauss in the 2004 film adaptation of _A Series\nof Unfortunate Events_.[22] It was also revealed that Presley Smith would play\n[Sunny Baudelaire](/wiki/Sunny_Baudelaire \"Sunny Baudelaire\"),[8] whose quasi-\nnonsensical lines are voiced by [Tara Strong](/wiki/Tara_Strong \"Tara\nStrong\"),[9] and [Rhys Darby](/wiki/Rhys_Darby \"Rhys Darby\") would play\nCharles, Sir's partner.[12]\n\n### Filming\n\nProduction began in May 2016 in [Vancouver](/wiki/Vancouver \"Vancouver\"),\n[British Columbia](/wiki/British_Columbia \"British Columbia\"),[47][48] and in\nAugust 2016 several cast members expressed through social media that filming\nhad finished.[49] Filming for the second season began in April 2017.[50] The\nthird season began filming on January 5, 2018.[51]\n\nOne aspect of the series of books that the production team wanted to be\ncaptured in the series was the notion of a lack of specific time period or\ngeography for the settings; Handler stated that he wrote enough for\nestablishing set pieces, but purposely left more specific details vague \"in\norder for young readers to fill in the blanks themselves.\" Sonnenfeld wanted\nto capture that same sense of ambiguous time and place, and he and his team\nworked to try to define a set of subjective rules of what elements could be\nincluded. Sonnenfeld brought on [Bo Welch](/wiki/Bo_Welch \"Bo Welch\"),\nproduction designer for _[Edward Scissorhands](/wiki/Edward_Scissorhands\n\"Edward Scissorhands\")_ , which Handler considered to capture the same sense\nof a \"familiar but completely imaginary\" suburban setting he had in mind for\nhis books. While the production team used [computer-generated\nimagery](/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery \"Computer-generated imagery\") where\nneeded, they attempted to avoid this use where possible, such as by using\nlarge painted backdrops, by key scenic artist John E. Wilcox, rather than\nemploying [green screen](/wiki/Chromakey \"Chromakey\") filming.[41]\n\n### Music\n\nIn April 2016, Nick Urata was initially reported to be composing music for the\nseries.[52] Once the first season was released, it was revealed that Urata\ncollaborated with Daniel Handler to compose the main title theme, as well as\nvarious original songs that appear throughout the series, with Handler\ncontributing the lyrics. The first season's original score was composed by\n[James Newton Howard](/wiki/James_Newton_Howard \"James Newton Howard\"), with\nhis frequent collaborators Sven Faulconer and [Chris\nBacon](/wiki/Chris_Bacon_\\(composer\\) \"Chris Bacon \\(composer\\)\") filling in\nto score certain episodes.[53] In season two, [Jim\nDooley](/wiki/James_Dooley_\\(composer\\) \"James Dooley \\(composer\\)\") joined\nthe production as composer and subsequently wrote the music for all ten\nepisodes.[54]\n\n### Visual effects\n\n[Zoic Studios](/wiki/Zoic_Studios \"Zoic Studios\") created visual effects for\nthe series, including the effects for many of Sunny Baudelaire's actions.[55]\n[Tippett Studio](/wiki/Tippett_Studio \"Tippett Studio\") also did work on the\nseries, including the effects for the destruction of Josephine's house,\nlandscape shots of Lake Lachrymose and some of the more movement heavy Sunny\nBaudelaire shots.[56]\n\n## Release\n\nAll eight episodes of the first season of _A Series of Unfortunate Events_\nwere released worldwide on Netflix on January 13, 2017,[18] in [Ultra\nHD](/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television \"Ultra-high-definition television\")\n[4K](/wiki/4K_resolution \"4K resolution\").[57] The second season was released\non March 30, 2018.[58]\n\n### Marketing\n\nOn July 5, 2015 a video titled \"An Unfortunate Teaser\" was uploaded to\n[YouTube](/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\") by a user named \"Eleanora Poe\". Netflix\nquickly released a statement saying \"This was not released from Netflix.\"\nMedia outlets were almost unanimous in agreement that the trailer was fan-\nmade.[59][60][61][62] However, Caitlin Petrakovitz of CNET argued that the\ntrailer may be real and that Netflix's carefully worded denial was a marketing\ncampaign, noting the user name \"Eleanora Poe\" being the same as a character\nfrom the series, and that a vinyl record seen in the trailer was of [The\nGothic Archies](/wiki/The_Gothic_Archies \"The Gothic Archies\"), a band who\nprovided the theme music for the audio books of _A Series of Unfortunate\nEvents_.[63] The trailer was later revealed to be a spec promo, similar to a\n[spec script](/wiki/Spec_script \"Spec script\"), by an independent commercial\ndirector, whom Netflix contracted to make a title sequence for the series\nafter the video's popularity, though they did not go ahead with the\nconcept.[64]\n\nIn October 2016, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for _A Series of\nUnfortunate Events_ , where Warburton narrates the events of the series as\nLemony Snicket.[18] A trailer, featuring footage from the series and Neil\nPatrick Harris's character, Count Olaf, was released by Netflix in November\n2016,[65] followed shortly by the first full trailer.[8] The second trailer\nwas released in December 2016,[66] followed by a \"holiday-themed\" trailer from\nCount Olaf leading fans to a [viral marketing](/wiki/Viral_marketing \"Viral\nmarketing\") website for the fictional Valorous Farms Dairy, which featured\nfour holiday e-cards for download.[67]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Audience viewership\n\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their\noriginal series, [Symphony Technology Group](/wiki/Symphony_Technology_Group\n\"Symphony Technology Group\") compiled data for the first season based on\npeople using software on their devices that measure television viewing by\ndetecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, 3.755 million viewers age\n18-49 were watching an episode of _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ over the\naverage minute in its first weekend of release.[68]\n\n### Critical response\n\n#### Season 1\n\nThe first season of _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ received critical\nacclaim. Review aggregator [Rotten Tomatoes](/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes \"Rotten\nTomatoes\") gives the season an approval rating of 94% based on 62 reviews,\nwith an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads,\n\"Enjoyably dark, _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ matches the source\nmaterial's narrative as well as its tone, leaving viewers with a wonderfully\nweird, dry, gothic comedy.\"[69] On [Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic \"Metacritic\")\nthe season has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating\n\"universal acclaim\".[70]\n\nErik Adams of _[The A.V. Club](/wiki/The_A.V._Club \"The A.V. Club\")_ awarded\nthe season a B and praised it for treating \"mature themes like grief, loss,\nand disappointment with sardonic honesty.\" Adams compared the program\npositively to the [Adam West](/wiki/Adam_West \"Adam West\")\n_[Batman](/wiki/Batman_\\(TV_series\\) \"Batman \\(TV series\\)\")_ series, calling\nit \"kids stuff with adult sophistication, driven by two-part stories,\noutrageous visuals, and the scenery-chewing of big-name guest stars\".[71] Ben\nTravers of _[Indiewire](/wiki/Indiewire \"Indiewire\")_ gave the series an A-,\nsaying that it \"proves as inspirational and endearing as it claims to be\nforlorn and heartbreaking\". Brian Lowry of [CNN](/wiki/CNN \"CNN\") praised the\nshowrunners for \"infusing the show with a lemony-fresh feel, conjuring a\nseries similar to the fantastical tone of _[Pushing\nDaisies](/wiki/Pushing_Daisies \"Pushing Daisies\")_ \". Lowry wrote that \"the\nshow proves a good deal of fun\" and that \"Harris dives into his over-the-top\ncharacter with considerable gusto.\" He also argued that the series improved\nupon the 2004 film.[72]\n\nSeveral critics praised the television series as a better adaptation of the\nbooks than the 2004 [feature\nfilm](/wiki/Lemony_Snicket%27s_A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events \"Lemony\nSnicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\"), which starred [Jim\nCarrey](/wiki/Jim_Carrey \"Jim Carrey\") as Count Olaf. Kelly Lawler of _[USA\nToday](/wiki/USA_Today \"USA Today\")_ felt the television format gave the\nstories more room to develop, the addition of Warburton as the [fourth\nwall](/wiki/Fourth_wall \"Fourth wall\")-breaking Snicket helped to convey some\nof the wordplay humor used in the books, and Harris's portrayal of Olaf was\n\"much more dynamic, and creepier\" than Carrey's version.[73] _[The\nVerge](/wiki/The_Verge \"The Verge\")_ 's Chaim Gartenburg said that the show\nfollows the books much more faithfully than the film, and \"nails down the tone\nthat made the stories so special\".[74] _[Los Angeles\nTimes](/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times \"Los Angeles Times\")_ writer Robert Lloyd felt\nthat the backgrounds of Sonnenfeld and Welch made them \"the right people for\nthis job, set in a milieu that is hard to fix in time, except to say it is not\nnow\", in capturing the tones of the book compared to the feature film.[75]\n\nNick Allen of [RogerEbert.com](/wiki/RogerEbert.com \"RogerEbert.com\"), on the\nother hand, gave the series a negative review, calling it \"an unfunny parody\nof sadness\" that is \"never as clever as it wants to be\" and would only appeal\nto fans of the books.[76] Caroline Framke of _[Vox Media](/wiki/Vox_Media \"Vox\nMedia\")_ praised the series for its unique and weird visuals, but found the\nshow's tone, pacing and performances to be haphazard and considered the show\nto be \"literally, a series of unfortunate events\".[77]\n\n#### Season 2\n\nAs with the first season, the second season of _A Series of Unfortunate\nEvents_ received critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the\nsecond season an approval rating of 100% based on 10 reviews, with an average\nrating of 7.8/10.[78] Clarisse Loughrey of _[The\nIndependent](/wiki/The_Independent \"The Independent\")_ praised the show as one\nthat \"essentially deals with thoughtful, intelligent young people battling to\nspeak up against an illogical world.\" While observing that the \"show may revel\nin the miserable\", she opined \"that the purpose of its own morbidity is to\noffer the assurance that hope lives in even the darkest of places.\" Loughrey\nalso credited the show's expanded storyline for the Baudelaire's adult allies\nfor \"plumping up\" the episodes' narrative arcs and deepening the show's\nemotional impact.[79]\n\nTristram Fane Saunders of _[The Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph \"The\nDaily Telegraph\")_ awarded the second season four out of five stars. He\ndescribed the show as a \"gothic treat [that] also offers a wicked line in\nabsurdist humour, and the most gorgeously toybox-like set designs you’ll find\nanywhere outside a [Wes Anderson](/wiki/Wes_Anderson \"Wes Anderson\")\nfilm.\"[80] _[Radio Times](/wiki/Radio_Times \"Radio Times\")_ reviewer Huw\nFullerton praised the series for its faithfulness to the original novels.\nWhile praising the improved CGI used to make Presley Smith's character Sunny\nBaudelaire react better to situations, he criticized the addition of\nsupporting \"good\" characters such as [Nathan Fillion](/wiki/Nathan_Fillion\n\"Nathan Fillion\")'s Jacques Snicket and [Sara Canning](/wiki/Sara_Canning\n\"Sara Canning\")'s Jacquelyn for \"undercutting the bleakness and loneliness\nthat characterized the novels.\"[81]\n\nRohan Naahar of the _[Hindustan Times](/wiki/Hindustan_Times \"Hindustan\nTimes\")_ described _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ as \"one of the most lavish\noriginals in Netflix's bottomless catalogue, created by fans, for fans.\" He\nalso praised Neil Patrick Harris' performance as Count Olaf.[82] The [Den of\nGeek](/wiki/Dennis_Publishing \"Dennis Publishing\") reviewer Michael Ahr\npraised tortoise-shell 'amphibiophones' and stone marimbas score for giving\nthe television series its primal sound.[83] [IGN](/wiki/IGN \"IGN\") reviewer\nJonathon Dornbush criticized the second season's formulaic plot structure and\nlack of the insightful observations compared to the first season. He also\npraised several of the second season's episodes particularly \"The Ersatz\nElevator\", \"The Hostile Hospital\", and \"The Carnivorous Carnival\" for smartly\ntwisting the story formula and deepening the novel series' mythology. Dornbush\nalso praised the performance of guest stars such as [Lucy\nPunch](/wiki/Lucy_Punch \"Lucy Punch\") and [Patrick\nWarburton](/wiki/Patrick_Warburton \"Patrick Warburton\") and awarded the second\nseason 7.2 stars.[84]\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\nYear | Award | Category | Nominee | Result | Ref  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n2017 | [Leo Awards](/wiki/Leo_Awards \"Leo Awards\") | Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series | Luis Alejandro Guevara, Bob Habros, Cale Jacox, Ron Simonson, Jeffrey De Guzman | Nominated | [85]  \nBest Make-Up in a Dramatic Series | Rita Ciccozzi, Krista Seller, Tanya Hudson, Gitte Axen | Won  \nBest Hairstyling in a Dramatic Series | Julie Mchaffie, Dianne Holme, Jenine Lehfeldt | Won  \nBest Guest Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series | [Sara Canning](/wiki/Sara_Canning \"Sara Canning\") | Nominated  \n[Saturn Awards](/wiki/Saturn_Awards \"Saturn Awards\") | Best New Media Television Series | _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ | Nominated | [86]  \n[Creative Arts Emmy Awards](/wiki/Creative_Arts_Emmy_Award \"Creative Arts Emmy Award\") | [Outstanding Music Composition for a Series](/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Music_Composition_for_a_Series \"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series\") | James Newton Howard | Nominated | [87]  \n[Gold Derby TV Awards](/wiki/Gold_Derby_Awards \"Gold Derby Awards\") | Comedy Actor | Neil Patrick Harris | Nominated | [88]  \n[Hollywood Music in Media Awards](/wiki/Hollywood_Music_in_Media_Awards \"Hollywood Music in Media Awards\") | Main Title Theme – TV Show/Limited Series | [Nick Urata](/wiki/Nick_Urata \"Nick Urata\") and [Daniel Handler](/wiki/Daniel_Handler \"Daniel Handler\") | Won | [89]  \n2018 | [Satellite Awards](/wiki/Satellite_Awards \"Satellite Awards\") | Best Actor in a Series - Comedy or Musical | Neil Patrick Harris | Nominated | [90]  \n  \n## Notes\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Netflix and critics name the first two episodes as \"The Bad Beginning\", following the title of the book, while the episode itself displays the name of \"A Bad Beginning\" after the opening credits.[28][29]\n  2. **Jump up ^** Netflix names the episodes of the second season as Part 1 and Part 2, while the episodes themselves display the names as Part One and Part Two after the opening credits, following the format of the first season.\n  3. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Netflix names the ninth and tenth episodes as \"Carnivorous Carnival\", while the episodes themselves display the name of \"The Carnivorous Carnival\" after the opening credits, following the title of the book.[31][32]\n\n## References\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Wollaston, Sam (January 13, 2017).
