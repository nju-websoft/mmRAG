First played\nduring the [1871–72 season](/wiki/1871%E2%80%9372_FA_Cup \"1871–72 FA Cup\"), it\nis the [oldest association football\ncompetition](/wiki/Oldest_football_competitions \"Oldest football\ncompetitions\") in the world.[1] It is organised by and named after [The\nFootball Association](/wiki/The_Football_Association \"The Football\nAssociation\") (The FA). For sponsorship reasons, from 2015 through to 2018 it\nis also known as **The Emirates FA Cup**.

The tournament\nconsists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by [the semi-\nfinals](/wiki/FA_Cup_semi-finals \"FA Cup semi-finals\") and [the\nfinal](/wiki/FA_Cup_Final \"FA Cup Final\").

The last entrants are\nthe Premier League and [Championship](/wiki/EFL_Championship \"EFL\nChampionship\") clubs, into the draw for the Third Round Proper.[2] In the\nmodern era, only one non-league team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and\nteams below Level 2 have never reached the final.[note 1] As a result, as well\nas who wins, significant focus is given to those\n\"[minnows](/wiki/Underdog_\\(competition\\) \"Underdog \\(competition\\)\")\"\n(smaller teams) who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely\n\"giant-killing\" victory.\n\nWinners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and\nfive actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design,\nintroduced in 1911.

On 20 July 1871, in the offices of [_The\nSportsman_ newspaper](/wiki/The_Sportsman_\\(1865_newspaper\\) \"The Sportsman\n\\(1865 newspaper\\)\"), the FA Secretary [C. W. Alcock](/wiki/C._W._Alcock \"C.\nW. Alcock\") proposed to the FA committee that \"it is desirable that a\nChallenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for\nwhich all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete\".\nThe [inaugural FA Cup tournament](/wiki/1871%E2%80%9372_FA_Cup \"1871–72 FA\nCup\") kicked off in November 1871. After thirteen games in all,\n[Wanderers](/wiki/Wanderers_F.C. \"Wanderers F.C.\") were crowned the winners in\nthe final, on 16 March 1872. Wanderers retained the trophy the following year.\nThe modern cup was beginning to be established by the 1888–89 season, when\nqualifying rounds were introduced.[3]\n\nFollowing the [1914–15](/wiki/1914%E2%80%9315_FA_Cup \"1914–15 FA Cup\")\nedition, the competition was suspended due to the [First World\nWar](/wiki/World_War_I \"World War I\"), and did not resume until\n[1919–20](/wiki/1919%E2%80%9320_FA_Cup \"1919–20 FA Cup\"). The\n[1922–23](/wiki/1922%E2%80%9323_FA_Cup \"1922–23 FA Cup\") competition saw the\nfirst final to be played in the newly opened [Wembley\nStadium](/wiki/Wembley_Stadium_\\(1923\\) \"Wembley Stadium \\(1923\\)\") (known at\nthe time as the Empire Stadium). Due to the outbreak of [World War\nII](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the competition was not played between\nthe [1938–39](/wiki/1938%E2%80%9339_FA_Cup \"1938–39 FA Cup\") and\n[1945–46](/wiki/1945%E2%80%9346_FA_Cup \"1945–46 FA Cup\") editions. Due to the\nwartime breaks, the competition did not celebrate its centenary year until\n[1980–81](/wiki/1980%E2%80%9381_FA_Cup \"1980–81 FA Cup\"); fittingly the final\nfeatured a goal by [Ricky Villa](/wiki/Ricky_Villa \"Ricky Villa\") which was\nlater voted the greatest goal ever scored at Wembley Stadium, but has since\nbeen replaced by [Steven Gerrard](/wiki/Steven_Gerrard \"Steven Gerrard\").[4]\n\nHaving previously featured replays, the modern day practice of ensuring the\nsemi-final and final matches finish on the day, was introduced from 2000\nonwards. Redevelopment of Wembley saw the final played outside of England for\nthe first time, the 2001–2006 finals being played at the [Millennium\nStadium](/wiki/Millennium_Stadium \"Millennium Stadium\") in\n[Cardiff](/wiki/Cardiff \"Cardiff\"). The final returned to Wembley in 2007,\nfollowed by the semi-finals from 2008.\n\n## Eligibility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Eligibility\")]\n\nThe competition is open to any club down to Level 10 of the [English football\nleague system](/wiki/English_football_league_system \"English football league\nsystem\") which meets the eligibility criteria. All clubs in the top four\nlevels (the [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League \"Premier League\") and the\nthree divisions of the [Football League](/wiki/The_Football_League \"The\nFootball League\")) are automatically eligible. Clubs in the next six levels\n([non-league football](/wiki/Non-league_football \"Non-league football\")) are\nalso eligible provided they have played in either the FA Cup, [FA\nTrophy](/wiki/FA_Trophy \"FA Trophy\") or [FA Vase](/wiki/FA_Vase \"FA Vase\")\ncompetitions in the previous season. Newly formed clubs, such as [F.C. United\nof Manchester](/wiki/F.C._United_of_Manchester \"F.C. United of Manchester\") in\n[2005–06](/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_FA_Cup \"2005–06 FA Cup\") and also\n[2006–07](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_FA_Cup \"2006–07 FA Cup\"), may not therefore\nplay in the FA Cup in their first season. All clubs entering the competition\nmust also have a suitable stadium.\n\nIt is very rare for top clubs to miss the competition, although it can happen\nin exceptional circumstances. [Manchester United](/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.\n\"Manchester United F.C.\") did not defend their title in\n[1999–2000](/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_FA_Cup \"1999–2000 FA Cup\"), as they were\nalready in the [inaugural](/wiki/2000_FIFA_Club_World_Championship \"2000 FIFA\nClub World Championship\") [Club World Championship](/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup\n\"FIFA Club World Cup\"). The club stated that entering both tournaments would\noverload their fixture schedule and make it more difficult to defend their\nChampions League and Premier League titles. The club claimed that they did not\nwant to devalue the FA Cup by fielding a weaker side. The move benefited\nUnited as they received a two-week break and won the 1999–2000 league title by\nan 18-point margin, although they did not progress past the group stage of the\nClub World Championship. The withdrawal from the FA Cup, however, drew\nconsiderable criticism as this weakened the tournament's prestige and [Sir\nAlex Ferguson](/wiki/Alex_Ferguson \"Alex Ferguson\") later admitted his regret\nregarding their handling of the situation.[5][6][7]\n\nWelsh sides that play in English leagues are eligible, although since the\ncreation of the [League of Wales](/wiki/Welsh_Premier_League \"Welsh Premier\nLeague\") there are only six clubs remaining: [Cardiff\nCity](/wiki/Cardiff_City_F.C. \"Cardiff City F.C.\") (the only non-English team\nto win the tournament, in [1927](/wiki/1927_FA_Cup_Final \"1927 FA Cup\nFinal\")), [Swansea City](/wiki/Swansea_City_A.F.C. \"Swansea City A.F.C.\"),\n[Newport County](/wiki/Newport_County_A.F.C. \"Newport County A.F.C.\"),\n[Wrexham](/wiki/Wrexham_F.C. \"Wrexham F.C.\"), [Merthyr\nTown](/wiki/Merthyr_Town_F.C. \"Merthyr Town F.C.\") and [Colwyn\nBay](/wiki/Colwyn_Bay_F.C. \"Colwyn Bay F.C.\"). In the early years other teams\nfrom Wales, Ireland and Scotland also took part in the competition, with\nGlasgow side [Queen's Park](/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_F.C. \"Queen's Park F.C.\")\nlosing the final to [Blackburn Rovers](/wiki/Blackburn_Rovers \"Blackburn\nRovers\") in [1884](/wiki/1884_FA_Cup_Final \"1884 FA Cup Final\") and\n[1885](/wiki/1885_FA_Cup_Final \"1885 FA Cup Final\") before being barred from\nentering by the [Scottish Football\nAssociation](/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association \"Scottish Football\nAssociation\"). In the 2013–14 season the first [Channel\nIsland](/wiki/Channel_Islands \"Channel Islands\") club entered the competition\nwhen [Guernsey F.C.](/wiki/Guernsey_F.C. \"Guernsey F.C.\") competed for the\nfirst time.[8]\n\nThe number of entrants has increased greatly in recent years. In the\n[2004–05](/wiki/FA_Cup_2004%E2%80%9305 \"FA Cup 2004–05\") season, 660 clubs\nentered the competition, beating the long-standing record of 656 from the\n1921–22 season. In [2005–06](/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_FA_Cup \"2005–06 FA Cup\")\nthis increased to 674 entrants, in [2006–07](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_FA_Cup\n\"2006–07 FA Cup\") to 687, in [2007–08](/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_FA_Cup \"2007–08\nFA Cup\") to 731 clubs, and for the [2008–09](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_FA_Cup\n\"2008–09 FA Cup\") and [2009–10](/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_FA_Cup \"2009–10 FA Cup\")\ncompetitions it reached 762.[9] The number has varied slightly but remained\nroughly stable since then, with 759 clubs participating in\n[2010–11](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_FA_Cup \"2010–11 FA Cup\"), a record 763 in\n[2011–12](/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_FA_Cup \"2011–12 FA Cup\"), 758 for\n[2012–13](/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_FA_Cup \"2012–13 FA Cup\"), 737 for\n[2013–14](/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_FA_Cup \"2013–14 FA Cup\") and 736 for\n[2014–15](/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_FA_Cup \"2014–15 FA Cup\"). By comparison, the\nother major English domestic cup, the [League Cup](/wiki/EFL_Cup \"EFL Cup\"),\ninvolves only the 92 members of the Premier League and Football League.\n\n## Competition format[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Competition format\")]\n\n### Overview[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Overview\")]\n\nBeginning in August, the competition proceeds as a [knockout\ntournament](/wiki/Knockout_tournament \"Knockout tournament\") throughout,\nconsisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May. A system\nof byes ensures clubs above Level 9 and 10 enter the competition at later\nstages. There is no [seeding](/wiki/Seed_\\(tennis\\) \"Seed \\(tennis\\)\"), the\nfixtures in each round being determined by a random draw. Prior to the\nquarter-finals, fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only.[10] The first\nsix rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis. The\nnext six rounds are the \"proper\" rounds where all clubs are in one draw.\n\n### Schedule[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Schedule\")]\n\nEntrants from the bottom two levels (9 and 10) begin the competition in the\nExtra Preliminary Round. Clubs from higher levels are then added in later\nrounds, as per the table below. The months in which rounds are played are\ntraditional, with exact dates subject to each year's calendar.\n\nRound[2] | New entrants at this round[2] | Month | No of matches  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Qualifying Competition**[2]  \nExtra-Preliminary Round | Level 9 and 10 clubs | August | 184  \nPreliminary Round | Level 8 clubs | 160  \nFirst Round | Level 7 clubs | September | 116  \nSecond Round | Level 6 clubs | 80  \nThird Round | none | October | 40  \nFourth Round | Level 5 clubs | 32  \n**Competition Proper**[2]  \nFirst Round | Level 3 and 4 clubs | November | 40  \nSecond Round | none | December | 20  \nThird Round | Level 1 and 2 clubs | January | 32  \nFourth Round | none | 16  \nFifth Round | February | 8  \nQuarter-finals | March | 4  \nSemi-Finals | April | 2  \nFinal | May | 1  \n  \nThe qualifying rounds are regionalised to reduce the travel costs for smaller\nnon-league sides. The first and second proper rounds were also previously\nsplit into Northern and Southern sections, but this practice was ended after\nthe 1997–98 competition.\n\nThe final is normally held the Saturday after the [Premier\nLeague](/wiki/Premier_League \"Premier League\") season finishes in May. The\nonly seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were\n[1999–2000](/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_in_English_football \"1999–2000 in English\nfootball\"), when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an\nexperiment, and [2010–11](/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_in_English_football \"2010–11\nin English football\") and [2012–13](/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_in_English_football\n\"2012–13 in English football\") when the FA Cup Final was played before the\nPremier League season had finished, to allow [Wembley\nStadium](/wiki/Wembley_Stadium \"Wembley Stadium\") to be ready for the [UEFA\nChampions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League \"UEFA Champions League\")\nfinal,[11] as well as in [2011–12](/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_in_English_football\n\"2011–12 in English football\") to allow England time to prepare for that\nsummer's [European Championships](/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012 \"UEFA Euro 2012\").[12]\n\n### The draw[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: The draw\")]\n\nThe draws for the Extra-Preliminary, Preliminary, and First Qualifying Rounds\nused to all occur at the same time. Thereafter, the draw for each subsequent\nround is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round,\nmeaning that in the case of replays, clubs will often know their future\nopponents in advance. This season 2016/17 the draw for the 1st qualifying\nround was drawn at a later date as per previous season's later rounds.\n\nThe draw for each of the proper rounds is broadcast live on television,\nusually taking place at the conclusion of live coverage of one of the games of\nthe previous round. Public interest is particularly high during the draw for\nthe third round, which is where the top-ranked teams are added to the draw.\n\n### Tiebreaking[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Tiebreaking\")]\n\nIn rounds up to and including the fifth round proper, fixtures resulting in a\ndraw (after normal time) go to a [replay](/wiki/Replay_\\(sports\\) \"Replay\n\\(sports\\)\"), played at the venue of the away team, at a later date; if that\nreplay is still tied, the winner is settled by a period of [extra\ntime](/wiki/Overtime_\\(sports\\) \"Overtime \\(sports\\)\"), and if still\nnecessary, a [penalty shootout](/wiki/Penalty_shoot-\nout_\\(association_football\\) \"Penalty shoot-out \\(association football\\)\").\nSince [2016–17](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_FA_Cup \"2016–17 FA Cup\"), ties are\nsettled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and\npenalties.\n\nUntil [1990–91](/wiki/1990%E2%80%9391_FA_Cup \"1990–91 FA Cup\"), further\nreplays would be played until one team was victorious. Some ties took as many\nas six matches to settle; in their 1975 campaign, [Fulham](/wiki/Fulham_F.C.\n\"Fulham F.C.\") played a total of 12 games over six rounds, which remains the\nmost games played by a team to reach a final.[13] Replays were traditionally\nplayed three or four days after the original game, but from\n[1991–92](/wiki/1991%E2%80%9392_FA_Cup \"1991–92 FA Cup\") they were staged at\nleast 10 days later on police advice for the rounds proper. This led to\n[penalty shoot-outs](/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_\\(association_football\\) \"Penalty\nshoot-out \\(association football\\)\") being introduced, the first of which came\non 26 November 1991 when [Rotherham United](/wiki/Rotherham_United_F.C.\n\"Rotherham United F.C.\") eliminated [Scunthorpe\nUnited](/wiki/Scunthorpe_United_F.C. \"Scunthorpe United F.C.\").[14]\n\nFrom [1980–81](/wiki/1980%E2%80%9381_FA_Cup \"1980–81 FA Cup\") to\n[1998–99](/wiki/1998%E2%80%9399_FA_Cup \"1998–99 FA Cup\"), the [semi-\nfinals](/wiki/FA_Cup_semi-finals \"FA Cup semi-finals\") went to extra time on\nthe day if the score after 90 minutes was a draw. If the score was still level\nafter extra time, the match would go to a replay. Replays for the semi-finals\nwere scrapped for [1999–2000](/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_FA_Cup \"1999–2000 FA\nCup\"), the last semi-final to go into a replay was in 1998–99 when Manchester\nUnited beat Arsenal 2–1 after extra time. The first game had ended in a 0–0\ndraw.\n\nThe first [FA Cup Final](/wiki/FA_Cup_Final \"FA Cup Final\") to go to extra\ntime and a replay was the [1875 final](/wiki/1875_FA_Cup_Final \"1875 FA Cup\nFinal\"), between the [Royal Engineers](/wiki/Royal_Engineers_A.F.C. \"Royal\nEngineers A.F.C.\") and the [Old Etonians](/wiki/Old_Etonians_F.C. \"Old\nEtonians F.C.\").

For the first decade\nof the competition, the [Kennington Oval](/wiki/The_Oval \"The Oval\") was used\nas the semi-final venue. In the period between this first decade and the\nreopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues\naround England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-\nfinal, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of\ntravel.

The [original Wembley Stadium](/wiki/Wembley_Stadium_\\(1923\\)\n\"Wembley Stadium \\(1923\\)\") was also used seven times for semi-final, between\n1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring\nLondon teams. In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium.\n\nIn 2003 the FA took the decision to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-\nfinals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium.[18] This was\ncontroversial, with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far\nfrom London, as well as taking some of the prestige away from a Wembley\nfinal.[19] In defending the move, the FA has also cited the extra capacity\nWembley offers, although the 2013 fixture between Millwall and Wigan led to\nthe unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after\nthe game failed to sell out.[20] A fan poll by _[The\nGuardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")_ in 2013 found 86% opposition to\nWembley semi-finals.[20]\n\n### Final[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Final\")]\n\nThe final has been played at the rebuilt [Wembley\nStadium](/wiki/Wembley_Stadium \"Wembley Stadium\") since it opened, in\n[2007.](/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_FA_Cup \"2006–07 FA Cup\")[21] The rebuilding\nprocess meant that between 2001 and 2006 they were hosted at the [Millennium\nStadium](/wiki/Millennium_Stadium \"Millennium Stadium\") in\n[Cardiff](/wiki/Cardiff \"Cardiff\") in Wales.

There\nhave been two designs of trophy in use, but five physical trophies have been\npresented. The original trophy, known as the \"little tin idol\", was 18 inches\nhigh and made by Martin, Hall & Co. It was stolen in 1895 and never recovered,\nand so was replaced by an exact replica, used until 1910. The FA decided to\nchange the design after the 1909 winners, Manchester United, made their own\nreplica, leading the FA to realise they did not own the copyright.[26] This\nnew, larger design was by [Fattorini and Sons](/wiki/Fattorini_and_Sons\n\"Fattorini and Sons\"), and was used from 1911.[26] In order to preserve this\noriginal, from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica, although this had to\nbe replaced after just over two decades, after showing wear and tear from\nbeing handled more than in previous eras. This third replica, first used in\n2014, was built heavier to withstand the increased handling.[25] Of the four\nsurviving trophies, only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership.[27]\n\nThe name of the winning team is engraved on the silver band around the base as\nsoon as the final has finished, in order to be ready in time for the\npresentation ceremony.[25] This means the engraver has just five minutes to\nperform a task which would take 20 under normal conditions, although time is\nsaved by engraving the year on during the match, and sketching the presumed\nwinner.[28] During the final, the trophy is decorated with ribbons in the\ncolours of both finalists, with the loser's ribbons being removed at the end\nof the game.[29] The tradition of tying ribbons started after [Tottenham\nHotspur](/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C. \"Tottenham Hotspur F.C.\") won the [1901\nFA Cup Final](/wiki/1901_FA_Cup_Final \"1901 FA Cup Final\") and the wife of a\nSpurs director decided to tie blue and white ribbons to the handles of the\ncup.[30] Traditionally, at Wembley finals, the presentation is made at the\nRoyal Box, with players, led by the captain, mounting a staircase to a gangway\nin front of the box and returning by a second staircase on the other side of\nthe box. At Cardiff the presentation was made on a podium on the pitch.\n\nThe tradition of presenting the trophy immediately after the game did not\nstart until the [1882 final](/wiki/1882_FA_Cup_Final \"1882 FA Cup Final\");\nafter the first final in 1872 the trophy was not presented to the winners,\nWanderers, until a reception held four weeks later in the Pall Mall Restaurant\nin London.[31] Under the original rules, the trophy was to be permanently\npresented to any club which won the competition three times, although when\ninaugural winners Wanderers achieved this feat by the [1876\nfinal](/wiki/1876_FA_Cup_Final \"1876 FA Cup Final\"), the rules were changed by\nFA Secretary CW Alcock (who was also captain of Wanderers in their first\nvictory).[32]\n\n### Original design[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Original design\")]\n\n#### 1871 original[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: 1871 original\")]\n\nThe first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall & Co at a\ncost of £20[33] It was stolen from a [Birmingham](/wiki/Birmingham\n\"Birmingham\") shoe shop window belonging to William Shillcock while held by\n[Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. \"Aston Villa F.C.\") on 11 September 1895\nand was never seen again. Despite a £10 reward for information, the crime was\nnever solved. As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa\n£25 to pay for a replacement.\n\nJust over 60 years later, 80 year old career criminal Henry (Harry) James\nBurge claimed to have committed the theft, confessing to a newspaper, with the\nstory being published in the _[Sunday Pictorial](/wiki/Sunday_Pictorial\n\"Sunday Pictorial\")_ newspaper on 23 February 1958.

Such upsets are\nconsidered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition,\nand the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for\nwinners of the cup.[54] Almost every club in the [League\nPyramid](/wiki/English_football_league_system \"English football league\nsystem\") has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history.[55][56] It\nis considered particularly newsworthy when a top [Premier\nLeague](/wiki/Premier_League \"Premier League\") team suffers an upset defeat,\nor where the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e. from outside the\nprofessional levels of [The Football League](/wiki/The_Football_League \"The\nFootball League\").\n\nOne analysis of four years of FA Cup results showed that it was 99.85 per cent\nlikely that at least one team would beat one from its next higher division in\na given year. The probability drops to 48.8 per cent for a two-division gap,\nand 39.28 per cent for a three-division gap.[55]\n\n### Early years[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit\nsection: Early years\")]\n\n[The Football League](/wiki/The_Football_League \"The Football League\") was\nfounded in 1888, 16 years after the first FA Cup competition.

Only two other\nactual non-League clubs have even reached the final since the founding of the\nLeague: Sheffield Wednesday in 1890 (champions of the Football Alliance, a\nrival league which was already effectively the Second Division, which it\nformally became in 1892 – Wednesday being let straight into the First\nDivision), and [Southampton](/wiki/Southampton_F.C. \"Southampton F.C.\") in\n1900 and 1902 (in which years they were also Southern League champions,\nproving the strength of that league: again, they were probably of equivalent\nstandard to a First Division club at the time, but Southampton's form\nsubsequently faded and they did not join the League till 1920 and the\nformation of the Third Division.)\n\n### Non-league giant\nkillings[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit\nsection: Non-league giant killings\")]\n\nThe most recent examples of a [non-league](/wiki/Non-league \"Non-league\") team\n([Levels 5 to 10](/wiki/English_football_league_system#The_System \"English\nfootball league system\")) beating a Level 1 opponent are [National\nLeague](/wiki/National_League_\\(division\\) \"National League \\(division\\)\")\nside [Lincoln City](/wiki/Lincoln_City_F.C. \"Lincoln City F.C.\")'s [away\nvictory](/wiki/Burnley_0%E2%80%931_Lincoln_City_\\(2017\\) \"Burnley 0–1 Lincoln\nCity \\(2017\\)\") over Premier League side [Burnley](/wiki/Burnley_F.C. \"Burnley\nF.C.\") in the [2016–17 FA Cup](/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_FA_Cup \"2016–17 FA Cup\")\nand [Conference Premier](/wiki/Conference_Premier \"Conference Premier\") side\n[Luton Town](/wiki/Luton_Town_F.C. \"Luton Town F.C.\")'s [away\nvictory](/wiki/Norwich_City_0%E2%80%931_Luton_Town_\\(2013\\) \"Norwich City 0–1\nLuton Town \\(2013\\)\") over Level 1 [Premier\nLeague](/wiki/English_Premier_League \"English Premier League\")'s [Norwich\nCity](/wiki/Norwich_City_F.C. \"Norwich City F.C.\") in the [2012–13 Fourth\nRound Proper](/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_FA_Cup#Fourth_Round_Proper \"2012–13 FA\nCup\").

From 2002 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC\nhaving two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two. From\n[2008–09](/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_FA_Cup \"2008–09 FA Cup\") to\n[2013–14](/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_FA_Cup \"2013–14 FA Cup\"), FA Cup matches are\nshown live by [ITV](/wiki/ITV_\\(TV_channel\\) \"ITV \\(TV channel\\)\") across\nEngland and [Wales](/wiki/Wales \"Wales\"), with [UTV](/wiki/UTV_\\(TV_channel\\)\n\"UTV \\(TV channel\\)\") broadcasting to [Northern\nIreland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland \"Northern Ireland\") but STV refusing to show\nthem. ITV shows 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live\nmatches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one\nsemi-final exclusively live. The final is also shown live on ITV. Under the\nsame 2008 contract, [Setanta Sports](/wiki/Setanta_Sports \"Setanta Sports\")\nshowed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two\nquarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The channel also broadcast ITV's\nmatches exclusively to [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland \"Scotland\"), after the ITV\nfranchise holder in Scotland, [STV](/wiki/STV_\\(TV_network\\) \"STV \\(TV\nnetwork\\)\"), decided not to broadcast FA Cup games. Setanta entered\nadministration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal\nto broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and [England\ninternationals](/wiki/England_national_football_team \"England national\nfootball team\").[67] As a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed\nthe competition exclusively in the 2009–10 season with between three and four\nmatches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA\ncould not find a pay TV broadcaster in time. ESPN bought the competition for\nthe 2010–11 to 2012–13 season and during this time Rebecca Lowe became the\nfirst woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK.\n\nIn October 2009, The FA announced that ITV would show an additional match in\nthe First and Second Rounds on ITV, with one replay match shown on\n[ITV4](/wiki/ITV4 \"ITV4\"). One match and one replay match from the first two\nrounds will broadcast on The FA website for free, in a similar situation to\nthe [2010 World Cup\nQualifier](/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_\\(UEFA\\) \"2010 FIFA World\nCup qualification \\(UEFA\\)\") between\n[Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine_national_football_team \"Ukraine national football\nteam\") and [England](/wiki/England_national_football_team \"England national\nfootball team\").[68] The 2009–10 First Round match between [Oldham\nAthletic](/wiki/Oldham_Athletic_A.F.C. \"Oldham Athletic A.F.C.\") and [Leeds\nUnited](/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C. \"Leeds United A.F.C.\") was the first FA Cup\nmatch to be streamed online live.[69]\n\nMany[_[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions\n\"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")_] expected [BSkyB](/wiki/BSkyB\n\"BSkyB\") to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the\nremainder of the 2009–10 season which would include a semi-final and shared\nrights to the final.[70] [ESPN](/wiki/ESPN_\\(UK\\) \"ESPN \\(UK\\)\") took over the\npackage Setanta held for the FA Cup from the 2010–11 season.[71] The 2011\nfinal was also shown live on [Sky 3D](/wiki/Sky_3D \"Sky 3D\") in addition to\nESPN (who provided the 3D coverage for Sky 3D) and ITV.[72] Following the sale\nof ESPN's UK and Ireland channels to [BT](/wiki/BT_Group \"BT Group\"), ESPN's\nrights package transferred to [BT Sport](/wiki/BT_Sport \"BT Sport\") from the\n2013–14 season.[73]\n\n[BBC Radio 5 Live](/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live \"BBC Radio 5 Live\") and\n[Talksport](/wiki/Talksport \"Talksport\") provides radio coverage including\nseveral full live commentaries per round, with additional commentaries\nbroadcast on [BBC Local Radio](/wiki/BBC_Local_Radio \"BBC Local Radio\").\n\nUntil the 2008–09 season, the [BBC](/wiki/BBC \"BBC\") and [Sky\nSports](/wiki/Sky_Sports \"Sky Sports\") shared television coverage, with the\nBBC showing three matches in the earlier rounds. Some analysts argued the\ndecision to move away from the Sky and, in particular, the BBC undermined the\nFA Cup in the eyes of the public.[74]\n\nThe early rounds of the 2008–09 competition were covered for the first time by\nITV's online service, [ITV Local](/wiki/ITV_Local \"ITV Local\"). The first\nmatch of the competition, between Wantage Town and Brading Town, was broadcast\nlive online. Highlights of eight games of each round were broadcast as catch\nup on ITV Local.[75][76] Since ITV Local closed, this coverage did not\ncontinue.\n\nITV lost the rights to the FA Cup beginning with the [2014–15 FA\nCup](/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_FA_Cup \"2014–15 FA Cup\"), terrestrial rights will\nreturn to [BBC Sport](/wiki/BBC_Sport \"BBC Sport\"), with the final being shown\non [BBC One](/wiki/BBC_One \"BBC One\") while BT Sport hold the pay TV rights.\nUnder this deal, the BBC will show around the same number of games as ITV and\nstill having the first pick for each round.[77]\n\nMatches involving Welsh clubs are sometimes exclusively broadcast on [Welsh\nlanguage](/wiki/Welsh_language \"Welsh language\") channel [S4C](/wiki/S4C\n\"S4C\"), which is also available to view across the rest of the United Kingdom\non satellite and cable television, and through the channel's website.[78] A\nsimilar arrangement is shared with [BBC Cymru Wales](/wiki/BBC_Cymru_Wales\n\"BBC Cymru Wales\") from 2014–15, potentially giving the BBC an extra match per\nround.[79]\n\n### Overseas\nbroadcasters[[edit](/w/index.php?title=FA_Cup&action=edit&section=44 \"Edit\nsection: Overseas broadcasters\")]\n\nSee also: [List of FA Cup broadcasters](/wiki/List_of_FA_Cup_broadcasters\n\"List of FA Cup broadcasters\")\n\nThe FA sells overseas rights separately from the domestic contract.\n\nTerritory | Current broadcaster(s) | Former broadcaster(s)  \n---|---|---  \nAustralia | First Round to the Semi-finals are broadcast exclusively by [ESPN Australia](/wiki/ESPN_Australia \"ESPN Australia\"); final co-broadcast with [SBS](/wiki/Special_Broadcasting_Service \"Special Broadcasting Service\").
