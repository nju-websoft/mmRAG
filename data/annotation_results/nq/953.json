Like all\nother [state constitutions](/wiki/State_constitution_\\(United_States\\) \"State\nconstitution \\(United States\\)\"), it is supreme over Virginia's laws and acts\nof government, though it may be superseded by the [United States\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States Constitution\")\nand U.S. [federal law](/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States \"Law of the United\nStates\") as per the [Supremacy Clause](/wiki/Supremacy_Clause \"Supremacy\nClause\").\n\nThe original Virginia Constitution of 1776 was enacted in conjunction with the\n[Declaration of Independence](/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence\n\"United States Declaration of Independence\") by the first [thirteen\nstates](/wiki/Thirteen_colonies \"Thirteen colonies\") of the United States of\nAmerica. Virginia was an early state to adopt its own Constitution on June 29,\n1776, and the document was widely influential both in the United States and\nabroad.[1] In addition to frequent [amendments](/wiki/Amendments\n\"Amendments\"), there have been six major subsequent revisions of the\nconstitution (by Conventions for the constitutions of 1830, 1851, 1864, 1870,\n1902, and by commission for 1971 amendments). These new constitutions have\nbeen part of, and in reaction to, periods of major regional or social upheaval\nin Virginia. For instance, the 1902 constitution included provisions to\n[disfranchise African\nAmericans](/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_Reconstruction_era \"Disfranchisement\nafter Reconstruction era\"), who in 1900 made up nearly 36% of the state's\npopulation.[2] They did not regain suffrage until after passage of federal\n[civil rights](/wiki/Civil_rights \"Civil rights\") legislation in the\nmid-1960s.\n\n## Contents\n\n  * 1 Historic constitutions\n    * 1.1 1776\n    * 1.2 1830\n    * 1.3 1851\n    * 1.4 1864\n    * 1.5 1870\n    * 1.6 1902\n  * 2 Current constitution (1971)\n    * 2.1 Article I – Bill of Rights\n    * 2.2 Article II – Franchise and Officers\n    * 2.3 Article III – Division of Powers\n    * 2.4 Article IV – Legislature\n    * 2.5 Article V – Executive\n    * 2.6 Article VI – Judiciary\n    * 2.7 Article VII – Local Government\n    * 2.8 Article VIII – Education\n    * 2.9 Article IX – Corporations\n    * 2.10 Article X – Taxation and Finance\n    * 2.11 Article XI – Conservation\n    * 2.12 Article XII – Future changes\n  * 3 See also\n  * 4 References\n  * 5 External links\n\n## Historic\nconstitutions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Historic constitutions\")]\n\nSee also: [Virginia Conventions](/wiki/Virginia_Conventions \"Virginia\nConventions\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/George_Mason.jpg/180px-\nGeorge_Mason.jpg)](/wiki/File:George_Mason.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:George_Mason.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[George Mason](/wiki/George_Mason \"George Mason\"), one of the principal\narchitects of the 1776 Virginia Constitution\n\n###\n1776[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: 1776\")]\n\nThe preparation of the first Virginia Constitution began in early 1776, in the\nmidst of the early events of the [American\nRevolution](/wiki/American_Revolution \"American Revolution\"). Among those who\ndrafted the 1776 Constitution were [George Mason](/wiki/George_Mason \"George\nMason\") and [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\"). [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") was Virginia's\nrepresentative to the [Second Continental\nCongress](/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress \"Second Continental Congress\") in\nPhiladelphia at the time, and his drafts of the Virginia constitution arrived\ntoo late to be incorporated into the final document.[3] James Madison's work\non the Virginia Constitution helped him develop the ideas and skills that he\nwould later use as one of the main architects of the [United States\nConstitution](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United States\nConstitution\").[4]\n\nThe 1776 Constitution declared the dissolution of the rule of Great Britain\nover Virginia and accused England's King [George III](/wiki/George_III \"George\nIII\") of establishing a \"detestable and insupportable tyranny\". It also\nestablished separation of governmental powers, with the creation of the\n[bicameral](/wiki/Bicameral \"Bicameral\") [Virginia General\nAssembly](/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly \"Virginia General Assembly\") as the\nlegislative body of the state and the [Governor of\nVirginia](/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia \"Governor of Virginia\") as the \"chief\nmagistrate\" or executive. The accompanying [Virginia Declaration of\nRights](/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights \"Virginia Declaration of\nRights\"), written primarily by Mason, focuses on guarantees of basic human\nrights and freedoms and the fundamental purpose of government. It, in turn,\nserved as a model for a number of other historic documents, including the\n[United States Bill of Rights](/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights \"United\nStates Bill of Rights\").\n\nCritically, the 1776 Constitution limited the right to vote primarily to\nproperty owners and men of wealth. This effectively concentrated power in the\nhands of the landowners and aristocracy of Southeastern Virginia.[1]\nDissatisfaction with this power structure would come to dominate Virginia's\nconstitutional debate for almost a century.[5]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/1830constitution01.jpg/180px-1830constitution01.jpg)](/wiki/File:1830constitution01.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:1830constitution01.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n1830 Virginia Constitution, page one\n\n###\n1830[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: 1830\")]\n\nBy the 1820s, Virginia was one of only two states that limited voting to\nlandowners. In addition, because representation was by county rather than\npopulation, the residents of increasingly populous Western Virginia (the area\nthat would become [West Virginia](/wiki/West_Virginia \"West Virginia\") in\n1863) had grown discontented at their limited representation in the\nlegislature.[5] Pressure increased until a [constitutional\nconvention](/wiki/Virginia_Constitutional_Convention_of_1829%E2%80%931830\n\"Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829–1830\") was convened in 1829–1830.\nThis convention became largely a contest between eastern Virginia\n[planters](/wiki/Planter_\\(American_South\\) \"Planter \\(American South\\)\") of\nthe slaveholding elite and the less affluent yeomen farmers of Western\nVirginia. Issues of representation and [suffrage](/wiki/Suffrage \"Suffrage\")\ndominated the debate.[6] Delegates to the convention included such prominent\nVirginians as [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\"), [James\nMonroe](/wiki/James_Monroe \"James Monroe\"), [John Tyler](/wiki/John_Tyler\n\"John Tyler\"), and [John Marshall](/wiki/John_Marshall \"John Marshall\").[7]\n\nThe convention ultimately compromised by loosening suffrage requirements. It\nalso reduced the number of delegates and senators to the [Virginia General\nAssembly](/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly \"Virginia General Assembly\"). The\nresulting constitution was ratified by a popular majority, though most of the\nvoters in the western part of the state ended up voting against it.[8] Thus,\nthe underlying intrastate tensions remained, and would have to be addressed\nlater.\n\n###\n1851[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: 1851\")]\n\nAs of the 1840 [census](/wiki/Census \"Census\"), the majority of the white\nresidents of the state lived in western Virginia, but they were\nunderrepresented in the legislature because of the continued property\nrequirement for voting; not all held sufficient property to vote. This\ncompounded their dissatisfaction with the apportionment scheme adopted in\n1830, which was based on counties rather than population, thus giving\ndisproportionate power to the fewer, but propertied whites who lived in the\neastern part of the state and kept a grip on the legislature. As the state\nlegislature also elected the governor and the United States senators, Western\nVirginians felt they had little influence on state leadership. Their attempts\nto win electoral reform in the Virginia legislature were defeated each time.\nSome began to openly discuss the\n[abolition](/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States \"Abolitionism in the\nUnited States\") of slavery or [secession](/wiki/Secession \"Secession\") from\nthe state.[9] Ultimately, the eastern planters could not continue to ignore\ntheir discontent, and a new constitutional convention was called to resolve\nthe continuing tensions.\n\nThe most significant change adopted in the 1851 Constitution was elimination\nof the property requirement for voting, resulting in extension of the suffrage\nto all white males of voting age. The 1851 Constitution established popular\nelection for the [governor](/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia \"Governor of\nVirginia\"), the newly created office of [lieutenant\ngovernor](/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Virginia \"Lieutenant Governor of\nVirginia\"), and all Virginia judges, rather than the election of the top two\nstate officers by the legislature, or political appointment for judges.\nBecause of these changes, the 1851 Virginia Constitution became known as the\n\"Reform Constitution\".[10]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Francis_Pierpont_portrait.gif/180px-\nFrancis_Pierpont_portrait.gif)](/wiki/File:Francis_Pierpont_portrait.gif)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Francis_Pierpont_portrait.gif \"Enlarge\")\n\nPortrait of [Francis H.

Pierpont\") as governor. During\nthe Civil War, this separate or \"restored\" government approved the creation of\n[West Virginia](/wiki/West_Virginia \"West Virginia\") as a separate state\n(which was admitted to the Union in 1863) and in 1864 it approved a new\nConstitution.[11] The constitution was the product of a divided state and\ngovernment; it was the first since the original 1776 Constitution to be\nadopted by the legislature without a popular vote.\n\nThe 1864 Constitution abolished [slavery](/wiki/Slavery \"Slavery\") in\nVirginia, [disfranchised](/wiki/Disfranchisement \"Disfranchisement\") men who\nhad served in the [Confederate](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America\n\"Confederate States of America\") government, recognized the creation of the\n[State of West Virginia](/wiki/West_Virginia \"West Virginia\"), and adjusted\nthe number and terms of office of the members of the [Virginia\nAssembly](/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly \"Virginia General Assembly\").[12]\n\nThe [foreword](/wiki/Foreword \"Foreword\") to the current Virginia Constitution\ndoes not include the 1864 Constitution in its list of previous constitutions.\nIt notes that the 1864 Constitution was drafted under wartime conditions and\nwas of uncertain legal status.[13]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/John_Curtiss_Underwood.jpg/150px-\nJohn_Curtiss_Underwood.jpg)](/wiki/File:John_Curtiss_Underwood.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:John_Curtiss_Underwood.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nJohn C. Underwood. He so dominated the 1867–1868 constitutional convention\nthat the resulting document became known as the \"Underwood Constitution\".\n\n###\n1870[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: 1870\")]\n\nAfter the end of the Civil War, Virginia came briefly under military rule\nduring Reconstruction, with the district commanded by [John M.\nSchofield](/wiki/John_M._Schofield \"John M. Schofield\"). Pursuant to federal\n[Reconstruction](/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States \"Reconstruction\nera of the United States\") legislation, Schofield called for a new\nconstitutional convention to meet in Richmond from December 1867 to April\n1868. In protest of [freedmen](/wiki/Freedmen \"Freedmen\")'s suffrage, many of\nVirginia's conservative whites refused to participate in voting for\ndelegates.[14] As a result, Republicans led by Judge [John Curtiss\nUnderwood](/wiki/John_Curtiss_Underwood \"John Curtiss Underwood\") dominated\nthe convention. Opponents called the result the \"Underwood Constitution\"[15]\nor the \"Negro Constitution\", as it gave freedmen suffrage.[14]\n\nSignificant provisions included expanding the suffrage to all male citizens\nover the age of 21, which included [freedmen](/wiki/Freedmen \"Freedmen\");\nestablishing a state public school system for the first time, with mandatory\nfunding and attendance; and providing for judges to be elected by the General\nAssembly rather than by popular vote.[16] Controversy over clauses that\ncontinued the temporary disfranchisement of former Confederate government\nmembers delayed the adoption of the Constitution. An eventual compromise\nprovided for separate voting on the disfranchisement clauses and the rest of\nthe Constitution; the former failed to win approval.[12] The remainder of the\nUnderwood Constitution was ratified by a popular vote of 210,585 to 9,136, and\nwent into effect in 1870.\n\n###\n1902[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: 1902\")]\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, white Democrats regained power in state\nlegislatures across the South. They passed [Jim Crow](/wiki/Jim_Crow \"Jim\nCrow\") laws establishing [racial segregation](/wiki/Racial_segregation \"Racial\nsegregation\") in public facilities and restricting the lives of blacks.\nBeginning with Mississippi in 1890, legislatures began to ratify new\nconstitutions, amendments or electoral laws that\n[disfranchised](/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_Reconstruction_era\n\"Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era\") [African-American](/wiki/African-\nAmerican \"African-American\") voters, devising means such as [poll\ntaxes](/wiki/Poll_tax_\\(United_States\\) \"Poll tax \\(United States\\)\"),\n[literacy tests](/wiki/Literacy_test \"Literacy test\") and residential\nrequirements that passed Supreme Court review but worked against poor blacks\nand many poor whites. By the turn of the 20th century, six\n[Southern](/wiki/Southern_United_States \"Southern United States\") states had\nessentially eliminated the black vote, and pressure mounted among whites in\nVirginia to do the same, ostensibly as a way to stop electoral fraud and\ncorruption.[17]\n\nThe [1901 constitutional\nconvention](/wiki/Virginia_Constitutional_Convention_of_1902 \"Virginia\nConstitutional Convention of 1902\") met in this climate. Members were focused\non restricting black voting rights without violating the [Fifteenth Amendment\nto the United States\nConstitution](/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") or disfranchising\npoor whites.[18] Led by the future [Senator](/wiki/United_States_Senate\n\"United States Senate\") [Carter Glass](/wiki/Carter_Glass \"Carter Glass\"), the\nconvention created requirements that all prospective voters had to pay [poll\ntaxes](/wiki/Poll_tax_\\(United_States\\) \"Poll tax \\(United States\\)\") or pass\na literacy test administered by white registrars. An exemption was granted, in\na kind of [grandfather clause](/wiki/Grandfather_clause \"Grandfather clause\"),\nfor military [veterans](/wiki/Veteran \"Veteran\") and sons of veterans, who\nwere virtually all white. The changes effectively disfranchised black voters,\nthough many [illiterate](/wiki/Literacy \"Literacy\") whites were also unable to\nmeet the new requirements. In 1900 blacks made up nearly 36 percent of the\npopulation.[2] In succeeding elections, the Virginia electorate was reduced by\nnearly half as a result of the changes.[19] When adjusted for [the Nineteenth\nAmendment](/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), voter turnout would\nnot return to 1900 levels until 1952 within a statewide population almost\ntwice the size. The small electorate was key to maintaining the dominant\nDemocratic Organization in power for sixty years.[20]\n\nOther significant provisions of the 1902 Constitution imposed [racial\nsegregation](/wiki/Racial_segregation \"Racial segregation\") in public schools\n(which already existed on a _[de facto](/wiki/De_facto \"De facto\")_ basis) and\nabolished the county court system. The Constitution provided for the creation\nof the [State Corporation Commission](/wiki/State_Corporation_Commission\n\"State Corporation Commission\") to regulate the growing power of the\nrailroads.[21] Because of concern over African-American opposition, the\nconvention did not honor its pledge to have the proposed constitution put to\npopular vote.[22] Like the 1864 Constitution by the Loyalist government during\nthe Civil War, the legislature adopted the 1902 Constitution without\nratification by the electorate. It was in effect far longer than any previous\nVirginia constitution.[23]\n\n## Current constitution\n(1971)[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Current constitution \\(1971\\)\")]\n\nAs a result of the [Civil Rights Movement](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement \"Civil\nRights Movement\") challenging the restrictions and discrimination practiced\nagainst blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of [US Supreme\nCourt](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United\nStates\") cases, beginning with _[Brown v. Board of\nEducation](/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education \"Brown v. Board of Education\")_\nin 1954, the [24th Amendment](/wiki/Twenty-\nfourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-fourth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution\"), and federal legislation: the [Civil Rights\nAct of 1964](/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964 \"Civil Rights Act of 1964\") and\nthe [Voting Rights Act of 1965](/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act \"Voting Rights Act\")\nhad overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the\nprovisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school\nsegregation. Combined with the election of\n[Governor](/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia \"Governor of Virginia\") [Mills\nGodwin](/wiki/Mills_E._Godwin,_Jr. \"Mills E. Godwin, Jr.\") in 1965, there was\nimpetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of\nthe strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing,\nand used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a\njoint resolution of the [Virginia General\nAssembly](/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly \"Virginia General Assembly\")\napproved a new commission, chaired by former Governor [Albertis\nHarrison](/wiki/Albertis_S._Harrison,_Jr. \"Albertis S. Harrison, Jr.\"), to\nrevise the constitution.[24]\n\nThe Commission on Constitutional Revision presented its report and\nrecommendations to Governor Godwin and the General Assembly in January 1969,\nand continued to work with them to draft a final consensus version.[25] The\nproposed Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of Virginia\n(who by then included African-American men and women, following passage of\nfederal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s) and took effect on July 1,\n1971.\n\nSince 1971, additional amendments have been passed by the General Assembly and\napproved by the voter to conform to provisions in the U.S. Constitution,\nrulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and Congressional statute. The voting age\nhas been reduced to eighteen, voting residency requirements have been removed,\nand voter registration conforms to the Motor Voter Act. Additionally, the\nVirginia Constitution now provides for a General Assembly session following a\ngovernor’s veto, and the right of the people to hunt, fish and harvest game is\nguaranteed.[26] In 2006, Virginians passed an amendment limiting marriage to\n“unions between one man and one woman”.[27] That has since been overturned by\n[Obergefell v. Hodges](/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges \"Obergefell v. Hodges\")\n(2015).\n\nThe current Constitution of Virginia consists of twelve Articles:[28]\n\n### Article I – Bill of\nRights[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Article I – Bill of Rights\")]\n\nArticle I contains the entire original [Virginia Declaration of\nRights](/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights \"Virginia Declaration of Rights\")\nfrom the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to\nincorporate concepts from the [United States Bill of\nRights](/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights \"United States Bill of Rights\"),\nincluding the right to [due process](/wiki/Due_process \"Due process\"), the\nprohibition against [double jeopardy](/wiki/Double_jeopardy \"Double\njeopardy\"), and the [right to bear arms](/wiki/Right_to_arms \"Right to arms\").\nLike the Federal Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, in §17, states\nthat the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other\nrights held by the people.\n\nIn 1997, a [Victims' Rights Amendment](/wiki/Victims%27_Rights_Amendment\n\"Victims' Rights Amendment\") was added to the Virginia Bill of Rights as §8-A.\nIn _Nobrega v. Commonwealth,_ the only case so far to interpret this\namendment, the [Virginia Supreme Court](/wiki/Virginia_Supreme_Court \"Virginia\nSupreme Court\") used the Victims’s Rights Amendment to support its ruling that\nan alleged rape victim could not be compelled to submit to a psychiatric\nevaluation.[29]\n\nOn November 7, 2006, Virginia voters ratified an amendment, previously\napproved by the General Assembly, prohibiting [same-sex marriage](/wiki/Same-\nsex_marriage_in_the_United_States \"Same-sex marriage in the United States\"),\nto be added to the Bill of Rights.[30] This amendment also prohibits the\nrecognition of any \"union, partnership, or other legal status\" between\nunmarried people that intends to approximate marriage or which confers the\n\"rights, benefits, obligations, qualities, or effects of marriage.\" The\n[Virginia Attorney General](/wiki/Virginia_Attorney_General \"Virginia Attorney\nGeneral\") issued an opinion stating that the amendment does not change the\nlegal status of documents such as contracts, wills, or [Advanced Medical\nDirectives](/wiki/Advanced_Medical_Directive \"Advanced Medical Directive\")\nbetween unmarried people.[31] The amendment was declared to be in violation\nthe United States Constitution by a U.S. District Court Judge on February 13,\n2014.[32] (In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in _[Obergefell v.\nHodges](/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges \"Obergefell v. Hodges\")_ that the failure\nto provide for same-sex marriage by any [U.S. state](/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S.\nstate\") had the effect of violating the rights of homosexuals to [equal\nprotection of law](/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause \"Equal Protection Clause\")\nrequired under the [Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution](/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\n\"Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\").)\n\n### Article II – Franchise and\nOfficers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Article II – Franchise and Officers\")]\n\nThe second Article of the Constitution sets out the procedures and mechanisms\nfor voting, elections and holding office. Pursuant to Section 1, any Virginia\nresident over age 18 may vote in state elections; the voting age was reduced\nfrom 21 by a 1972 amendment to the federal constitution.[33] However, § 1\ndenies the vote to people who have been determined to be mentally incompetent\n[or anyone convicted of a felony](/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement_in_Virginia\n\"Felony disenfranchisement in Virginia\"). Disfranchising convicted felons has\nbeen found to be consistent with the [Equal Protection\nClause](/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause \"Equal Protection Clause\") of the U.S.\nConstitution.[34] The General Assembly, pursuant to §4, is given wide power to\nregulate the time place and manner of all elections.[35]\n\nSection Five establishes that the only qualifications to hold office in\nVirginia are that a person must have been a Virginia resident for at least one\nyear and eligible to vote. Any statute or rule requiring other qualifications\nis constitutionally invalid under this section.[36] But, the General Assembly\ncan impose local residency requirements for election to local governmental\nbodies or for election to the Assembly in representation of particular\ndistricts.\n\n### Article III – Division of\nPowers[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Article III – Division of Powers\")]\n\nArticle III has one section, confirming the principle of [separation of\npowers](/wiki/Separation_of_powers \"Separation of powers\") between the\n[legislative](/wiki/Legislative \"Legislative\"),\n[executive](/wiki/Executive_\\(government\\) \"Executive \\(government\\)\") and\n[judicial](/wiki/Judicial \"Judicial\") branches of government. Unlike the U.S.\nfederal Constitution, the Virginia Constitution explicitly provides that no\nbranch may exercise powers that properly belong to the others.[37] Separation\nbetween the branches of government is also listed as a right of the people in\n§5 of Article I.\n\n### Article IV –\nLegislature[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=12\n\"Edit section: Article IV – Legislature\")]\n\nArticle IV establishes the basic structure and authority of the Virginia\nlegislature. The legislative power of the state is vested in the [Virginia\nGeneral Assembly](/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly \"Virginia General\nAssembly\"), which consists of the [Virginia Senate](/wiki/Virginia_Senate\n\"Virginia Senate\") and the [Virginia House of\nDelegates](/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates \"Virginia House of Delegates\").\n§17 of Article IV gives the legislature the power to [impeach](/wiki/Impeach\n\"Impeach\") members of the executive and judicial branches.\n\nThe original §14 of Article IV forbade the incorporation of churches, though\nthe Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had\nrecognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district\ncourt for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this\nprovision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because\nit violates the federal constitutional right to the free exercise of\nreligion.[38] The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the\noption to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate.[39]\nAn amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia\nvoters in November 2006.\n\n### Article V –\nExecutive[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Article V – Executive\")]\n\nThe fifth Article similarly defines the structure and powers of the executive\nbranch. The [Governor of Virginia](/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia \"Governor of\nVirginia\") is invested as the chief executive, though §1 of Article V,\nprovides that the governor may not run for successive terms. The offices of\n[lieutenant governor](/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Virginia \"Lieutenant\nGovernor of Virginia\") and [attorney\ngeneral](/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Virginia \"Attorney General of Virginia\")\nare established as supporting elected constitutional positions.\n\nThe constitutional powers of the governor include the ability to sign\nlegislation, [veto](/wiki/Veto \"Veto\") bills (which veto may then be\noverridden by a two-thirds majority of both houses of the assembly), and issue\n[pardons](/wiki/Pardons \"Pardons\").\n\n### Article VI –\nJudiciary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Article VI – Judiciary\")]\n\nArticle VI vests judicial power in the [Supreme Court of\nVirginia](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Virginia \"Supreme Court of Virginia\"), along\nwith the subordinate courts created by the General Assembly. Judges are\nappointed by a majority vote in the General Assembly to terms of 12 years for\nSupreme Court Justices and 8 years for other judges. The Supreme Court,\npursuant to §5, has the authority to make rules governing the practice of law\nand procedures in the courts of the commonwealth (see\n[rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20061005225811/http://leg1.state.va.us/000/scr/TOC.HTM)),\nand the [Chief Justice](/wiki/Chief_Justice \"Chief Justice\") of the Supreme\nCourt is established as the administrative head of the Virginia judicial\nsystem.\n\n### Article VII – Local\nGovernment[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: Article VII – Local Government\")]\n\nArticle VII of the Constitution sets up the basic framework for the structure\nand function of [local government in\nVirginia](/wiki/Political_subdivisions_of_Virginia \"Political subdivisions of\nVirginia\"). Local government may be established at the [town](/wiki/Town\n\"Town\") (population over 1000), [city](/wiki/City \"City\") (population over\n5000), [county](/wiki/County_\\(United_States\\) \"County \\(United States\\)\") or\n[regional government](/wiki/Regional_government \"Regional government\") level.\nArticle VII gives the General Assembly the power to create general laws for\nthe organization and governing of these political subdivisions, except that\nregional governments cannot be created without the consent of the majority of\nthe voters who vote on the issue in the region.\n\nSection 4 establishes the constitutional offices of\n[treasurer](/wiki/Treasurer \"Treasurer\"), [sheriff](/wiki/Sheriff \"Sheriff\"),\n[Commonwealth's Attorney](/wiki/Commonwealth%27s_Attorney \"Commonwealth's\nAttorney\"), [clerk of court](/wiki/Clerk_of_court \"Clerk of court\") and\n[Commissioner of the Revenue](/wiki/Commissioner_of_the_Revenue \"Commissioner\nof the Revenue\") to be elected within each city and county in Virginia.\n\n### Article VIII –\nEducation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=16\n\"Edit section: Article VIII – Education\")]\n\nA compulsory and free [primary](/wiki/Primary_education \"Primary education\")\nand [secondary](/wiki/High_school \"High school\") public education for every\nVirginia child is the focus of Article VIII. The General Assembly is empowered\nto determine the funding for the educational system and apportion the cost\nbetween state and local government. A state [Board of\nEducation](/wiki/Board_of_Education \"Board of Education\") is established to\ncreate school divisions and effectuate the overall educational policies.\nSupervision of the individual schools is delegated to local school boards,\nprovided for in §7.\n\n### Article IX –\nCorporations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=17\n\"Edit section: Article IX – Corporations\")]\n\nThe primary purpose of Article IX is to create the Virginia [State Corporation\nCommission](/wiki/State_Corporation_Commission \"State Corporation\nCommission\"), which is charged with administering the laws that regulate\n[corporations](/wiki/Corporations \"Corporations\"). The State Corporation\nCommission also issues charters for Virginia corporations and licenses to do\nbusiness for “foreign” (non-Virginia) corporations. Section 5 of Article IX\nprohibits such foreign corporations from doing anything in Virginia that a\nVirginia corporation could not do.\n\n### Article X – Taxation and\nFinance[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Article X – Taxation and Finance\")]\n\nArticle X establishes the basic structure for taxation of [personal\nproperty](/wiki/Personal_property \"Personal property\") in Virginia. Pursuant\nto this Article, all non-exempt real and personal property is subject to\ntaxation at its fair market value. Section 6 sets out a lengthy list of exempt\nproperty, which includes church property, cemeteries, and [non-\nprofit](/wiki/Non-profit \"Non-profit\") school property.\n\nSignificant additions to Article X include §7, a budget amendment, which\nbecame effective in 1986, and §7-A, which establishes the \"Lottery Proceeds\nFund\", requiring that all proceeds from the\n[lottery](/wiki/Virginia_State_Lottery \"Virginia State Lottery\") be set aside\nfor educational purposes.\n\n### Article XI –\nConservation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=19\n\"Edit section: Article XI – Conservation\")]\n\nArticle XI states that it is the general policy of the Commonwealth to\npreserve, protect and conserve the state’s [natural](/wiki/Natural_resources\n\"Natural resources\") and historic resources. The General Assembly is permitted\nto further these policies by entering into [public-private\npartnerships](/wiki/Public-private_partnerships \"Public-private partnerships\")\nor partnerships with federal agencies.\n\nA 2001 amendment added §4, which establishes [hunting](/wiki/Hunting\n\"Hunting\") and [fishing](/wiki/Fishing \"Fishing\") as constitutional rights of\nVirginians, though the legislature may enact appropriate regulations and\nrestrictions on these rights.\n\n### Article XII – Future\nchanges[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=20\n\"Edit section: Article XII – Future changes\")]\n\nThe last Article creates the mechanism for future changes to the Constitution.\nAny amendment to the Constitution must first be passed by a majority in each\nof the two legislative houses. The proposed amendment must then be held over\nfor consideration by the succeeding elected legislature, where it must again\nbe passed by a majority in each house. The amendment then goes on the general\n[ballot](/wiki/Ballot \"Ballot\") and becomes enacted into the Constitution if\napproved by a majority of the voters.\n\nAlternatively, a two-thirds majority of both Virginia houses may call for the\ncreation of a [constitutional\nconvention](/wiki/Constitutional_convention_\\(political_meeting\\)\n\"Constitutional convention \\(political meeting\\)\"). Any revisions or\namendments proposed by the constitutional convention are presented to the\ncitizens of Virginia and become law upon approval by a majority of voters.\n\nThere is a perennial discussion over Virginia’s unique Constitutional status\nrestricting its governor to one consecutive term, and its distinctive method\nof selecting both trial and appellate judges by state legislature, shared only\nwith South Carolina.[40]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=21\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [Law of Virginia](/wiki/Law_of_Virginia \"Law of Virginia\")\n  * [Virginia Conventions](/wiki/Virginia_Conventions \"Virginia Conventions\")\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Constitution_of_Virginia&action=edit&section=22\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\nNotes\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Lieberman, Jethro (1987). _The Enduring Constitution: A Bicentennial Perspective_.
