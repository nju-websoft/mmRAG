Thirty-nine years\nearlier, the Yogen-gyo (予言魚) foretold that a mighty opponent would appear\nbefore Beerus, the Super Saiyan [God](/wiki/Deity \"Deity\"). Beerus, with Whis,\nthen tracks down the Saiyan warrior [Goku](/wiki/Goku \"Goku\"), who defeated\nFreeza. On [Kaiō-sama](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Kai.C5.8D-sama\n\"List of Dragon Ball characters\")'s planet, Goku proceeds to challenge Beerus.\nDespite having powered up to Super Saiyan 3, Goku is ultimately overwhelmed\nand defeated in two strikes. Disappointed by the subsequent lack of challenge,\nBeerus departs in order to seek out more powerful adversaries on Earth.\n\nBeerus' arrival interrupts [Bulma](/wiki/Bulma \"Bulma\")'s birthday party.\n[Vegeta](/wiki/Vegeta \"Vegeta\"), who already knew about Beerus, because of a\nwarning from Kaiō-sama, casts his pride aside in order to put Beerus in a good\nmood. Meanwhile, [Pilaf](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Pilaf \"List of\nDragon Ball characters\"), [Mai](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Pilaf\n\"List of Dragon Ball characters\"), and\n[Shu](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Pilaf \"List of Dragon Ball\ncharacters\") sneak into the party in order to steal the Dragon Balls, but are\nnot recognized as they have been turned into children; before the events of\nthe film, they gathered all the Dragon Balls themselves and wished for youth,\nbut [Shenlong](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Shenlong \"List of Dragon\nBall characters\") made them a little too young. Discovering the three of them,\n[Trunks](/wiki/Trunks_\\(Dragon_Ball\\) \"Trunks \\(Dragon Ball\\)\") mistakes Pilaf\nfor a monkey and fibs to Goten that Mai is his girlfriend, which leads to the\ntrio being brought in front of the party-goers. When Mai accidentally drops\nthe Dragon Ball she stole, she takes Trunks hostage, but no one seems\nconcerned. A drunk [Gohan](/wiki/Gohan_\\(Dragon_Ball\\) \"Gohan \\(Dragon\nBall\\)\") dares Mai to shoot him; he deflects the bullets with one finger, but\none of them hits [Videl](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Videl \"List of\nDragon Ball characters\")'s leg and another one hits Beerus' forehead.\n[Dende](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Dende \"List of Dragon Ball\ncharacters\") heals Videl and discovers that she is pregnant with Gohan's\nchild. Videl has been hiding the fact to surprise Gohan later and they do not\nreveal it to the others yet. When Beerus asks [Mr. Boo](/wiki/Majin_Boo \"Majin\nBoo\") for one or two of the puddings he has, Boo eats all of them, angering\nthe God of Destruction who decides to destroy the Earth. Boo, [Android\n18](/wiki/Android_18 \"Android 18\"), [Tenshinhan](/wiki/Tenshinhan\n\"Tenshinhan\") and [Piccolo](/wiki/Piccolo_\\(Dragon_Ball\\) \"Piccolo \\(Dragon\nBall\\)\") attempt to fight Beerus, but are easily defeated. Gohan powers up and\nattacks Beerus only to be taken down by a heavy kick. Vegeta tries his hand at\ndefeating Beerus, but he is also taken down.\n[Goten](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Son_Goten \"List of Dragon Ball\ncharacters\") and Trunks fuse into Gotenks and attempt to fight Beerus but are\nquickly defeated as well.\n\nBulma becomes annoyed at the fighting ruining her birthday party and yells at\nBeerus before slapping him. When Beerus slaps her back, it sends Vegeta into a\nfit of rage, becoming even stronger than Goku, however, he is still defeated.\nGoku appears, having been watching Vegeta's fight and summons Shenlong to ask\nwhat a Super Saiyan God is. A Super Saiyan God once appeared on planet Vegeta\nto stop evil Saiyans, but failed because of the form's time limit. The dragon\nalso reveals that they need the power of six pure-hearted Saiyans for one of\nthem to reach the Super Saiyan God form. Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan\nGod, a form far stronger than even the Super Saiyan 3, thanks to the power of\nhimself, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks, Goten, and\n[Pan](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Pan \"List of Dragon Ball\ncharacters\") (from inside her mother Videl), fulfilling the prophecy once\nstated by the Oracle Fish. Goku confronts Beerus again and they wage an\nintense battle in space, right above planet Earth. The form gives Goku the\npower to resist Beerus, but he reverts to his regular Super Saiyan form due to\nits time limit. However, he learns the form's godlike feeling, which allows\nhim to use some amount of Super Saiyan God power against Beerus. The two seem\nto be equally strong, but Beerus eventually decides to use his strongest\nattack. Goku stops the energy sphere, barely holding it back, but after [Chi-\nChi](/wiki/List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Chi-Chi \"List of Dragon Ball\ncharacters\") and Goku's friends appear in Goku's mind he is able to absorb the\nenergy sphere and briefly transform into a Super Saiyan God once again.\nHowever, Goku is overwhelmed with exhaustion, and at Beerus' suggestion,\nfinally admits defeat. Beerus recognizes Goku's effort and reveals that he was\nthe second strongest person he had ever fought, after Whis, who is also his\nmartial arts master and is even stronger than he is. Goku also learns from\nBeerus and Whis that there are actually other universes with other Gods of\nDestruction. Back on Earth, Beerus decides to spare the planet and takes his\nleave with Whis after bidding farewell to Goku and his friends, who return to\nBulma's birthday party. It is revealed by Whis that Beerus used only 70% of\nhis power while fighting Goku.\n\n## Voice\ncast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dragon_Ball_Z:_Battle_of_Gods&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Voice cast\")]\n\nCharacter | Japanese voice actor | English voice actor  \n---|---|---  \n[Goku](/wiki/Goku \"Goku\") | [Masako Nozawa](/wiki/Masako_Nozawa \"Masako Nozawa\") | [Sean Schemmel](/wiki/Sean_Schemmel \"Sean Schemmel\")  \n[Vegeta](/wiki/Vegeta \"Vegeta\") | [Ryō Horikawa](/wiki/Ry%C5%8D_Horikawa \"Ryō Horikawa\") | [Christopher R.

The _Dragon\nBall_ series creator notes that the adaptation will mark the first time he has\nbeen so deeply involved in the production of an anime, in this case as early\nas the screenwriting stages. Toriyama also said that the film will retain the\natmosphere of the original while adding small amounts of modern flavor.[5]\n[Toei Animation](/wiki/Toei_Animation \"Toei Animation\") released a press\nstatement on July 17, 2012, saying it would be set \"between the animation\nseries _Z_ and _GT_ , or in other words from the blank decade between the end\nof the battle with Majin Boo in chapter 517 of the manga and chapter 518\" and\ncalling it part of \"the official history of _Dragon Ball_.\"[6]\n\nIn September, it was announced that the film was one of four that year, and\nthe only animated one, to receive money from the Japanese government as part\nof the non-profit organization UNIJAPAN's \"Co-production Certification\nProgram\".[7][8] Toei received 50 million yen (roughly US$636,000) from the\n[Agency for Cultural Affairs](/wiki/Agency_for_Cultural_Affairs \"Agency for\nCultural Affairs\"), whose aim is to promote Japanese arts and culture, with\nthe United States named as the film's partner country.[7][8]\n\n> This time in particular, we had a request from sensei to leave in not only\n> the action, but also some truly enjoyable... the truly enjoyable aspects of\n> Dragon Ball; Dragon Ball's chaotic feeling, and the action of Gohan's\n> battles and of the Z Fighters are mixed together very well, so I believe\n> that has also helped make it an enjoyable movie.\n>\n> — Gyarmath Bogdan, _MAG Net_ , NHK, March 1, 2013[_[citation\n> needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nThe December issue of _Ultra Jump_ elaborated on Toriyama's involvement in the\nmovie, stating he came up with the movie's story and character designs.[9] On\nDecember 2, the official website was updated with the movies' cast and entire\nstaff.[4] The following day, a brief introduction to the film's story was\nleaked from accessing an unlinked section of the website.[4]\n\nIn January 2013, it was announced that [Olympic](/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic\nGames\") gold medalist in [judo](/wiki/Judo \"Judo\") [Kaori\nMatsumoto](/wiki/Kaori_Matsumoto \"Kaori Matsumoto\") and\nsinger/[tarento](/wiki/Tarento \"Tarento\") [Shoko\nNakagawa](/wiki/Shoko_Nakagawa \"Shoko Nakagawa\") will have roles in the\nfilm.[10] Nakagawa is a well-known [otaku](/wiki/Otaku \"Otaku\") and Matsumoto\nis a fan of the series as well.[10] Matsumoto voices a policewoman modeled\nafter herself, while Nakagawa plays the Yogen-gyo (予言魚) who first leads Beerus\nto Goku.[10] The [Fuji TV](/wiki/Fuji_TV \"Fuji TV\") announcer [Shin-ichi\nKarube](/wiki/Mezamashi_TV#Karube_Shinichi \"Mezamashi TV\") also has a small\npart in the movie.\n\nThe April issue of _V Jump_ teased about a new Super Saiyan transformation\nbeing in the film, titled \"Super Saiyan God\" (超サイヤ人ゴッド, _Sūpā Saiya-jin\nGoddo_), saying: 39 years ago, the Oracle Fish told Beerus that the Super\nSaiyan God would appear before him.
