[Long-distance\ncalls](/wiki/Long_line_\\(telecommunications\\) \"Long line\n\\(telecommunications\\)\") are typically charged a higher billing rate than\nlocal calls. The term is not necessarily synonymous with placing calls to\nanother telephone [area code](/wiki/Area_code \"Area code\").\n\nLong-distance calls are classified into two categories: national or domestic\ncalls which connect two points within the same country, and international\ncalls which connect two points in different countries. Within the United\nStates there is a further division into long distance calls within a single\nstate (intrastate) and interstate calls, which are subject to different\nregulations (counter-intuitively, calls within states are usually more\nexpensive than interstate calls). Not all interstate calls are long distance\ncalls. Since 1984 there has also been a distinction between intra-[local\naccess and transport area](/wiki/Local_access_and_transport_area \"Local access\nand transport area\") (LATA) calls and those between different LATAs, whose\nboundaries are not necessarily state boundaries.\n\nBefore [direct distance dialing](/wiki/Direct_distance_dialing \"Direct\ndistance dialing\") (DDD), all long distance calls were established by special\n[switchboard operators](/wiki/Switchboard_operator \"Switchboard operator\")\n([long distance operators](/wiki/Long_distance_operator \"Long distance\noperator\")) even in exchanges where calls within the local exchange were\ndialed directly. Completion of long distance calls was time-consuming and\ncostly as each call was handled by multiple operators in multiple cities.\nRecordkeeping was also more complex, as the duration of every toll call had to\nbe manually recorded for billing purposes.\n\nIn many less-developed countries, such as Spain, Mexico, Brazil, and Egypt,\ncalls were placed at a central office the caller went to, filled out a paper\nslip, sometimes paid in advance for the call, and then waited for it to be\nconnected.[1] In Spain these were known as _locutorios_ , literally \"a place\nto talk\". In towns too small to support a phone office, placing long distance\ncalls was a sideline for some businesses with telephones, such as pharmacies.\n\nIn some countries, such as [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") and the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States \"United States\"), long-distance rates were\nhistorically kept artificially high to subsidize unprofitable flat-rate local\nresidential services.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Intense competition between long-distance\n[telephone companies](/wiki/Phone_company \"Phone company\") narrowed these gaps\nsignificantly in most developed nations in the late 20th century.\n\nThe cost of [international calls](/wiki/International_call \"International\ncall\") varies dramatically among countries. The receiving country has total\ndiscretion in specifying what the caller should be charged (by the originating\ncompany, who in a separate transaction transfers these funds to the\ndestination country) for the cost of connecting the incoming international\ncall with the destination customer anywhere in the receiving country. This has\nonly a loose, and in some cases no, relation to the actual cost. Some less-\ndeveloped countries, or their telephone company(s), use these fees as a\nrevenue source.

Another early call between cities had been made in\nCanada by telephone inventor [Alexander Graham\nBell](/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell \"Alexander Graham Bell\").[2]\n\nIn 1892, [AT&T](/wiki/American_Telephone_%26_Telegraph \"American Telephone &\nTelegraph\") built an interconnected long-distance telephone network, which\nreached from New York to Chicago, the technological limit for [non-amplified\nwiring](/wiki/Amplifier \"Amplifier\"). Users often did not use their own phone\nfor such connections, but made an appointment to use a special long-distance\n[telephone booth](/wiki/Telephone_booth \"Telephone booth\") or \"silence\ncabinet\" equipped with [4-wire telephones](/wiki/Four-wire_circuit \"Four-wire\ncircuit\") and other advanced technology. The invention of [loading\ncoils](/wiki/Loading_coil \"Loading coil\") extended the range to Denver in\n1911, again reaching a technological limit. A major research venture and\ncontest led to the development of the [audion](/wiki/Audion_tube \"Audion\ntube\")—originally invented by [Lee De Forest](/wiki/Lee_De_Forest \"Lee De\nForest\") and greatly improved by others in the years between 1907 and\n1914—which provided the means for telephone signals to reach from coast to\ncoast. Such transcontinental calling was made possible in 1914 but was not\nshowcased until early 1915, as a promotion for the upcoming [Panama–Pacific\nInternational\nExposition](/wiki/Panama%E2%80%93Pacific_International_Exposition\n\"Panama–Pacific International Exposition\") in San Francisco in the spring of\nthe same year.[3]\n\nOn January 25, 1915, [Alexander Graham Bell](/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell\n\"Alexander Graham Bell\") ceremonially sent the [first transcontinental\ntelephone call](/wiki/First_transcontinental_telephone_call \"First\ntranscontinental telephone call\") from 15 Dey Street in New York City, which\nwas received by his former assistant [Thomas A. Watson](/wiki/Thomas_A._Watson\n\"Thomas A. Watson\") at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco. This process,\nnevertheless, involved five intermediary [telephone operators](/wiki/Long-\ndistance_operator \"Long-distance operator\") and took 23 minutes to connect by\nmanually _patching in_ the route of the call.\n\n> \"On October 9, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A.

Leslie Denning](/wiki/M._Leslie_Denning \"M. Leslie\nDenning\") of [Englewood, New Jersey](/wiki/Englewood,_New_Jersey \"Englewood,\nNew Jersey\") to Mayor [Frank\nOsborne](/wiki/Frank_Osborne_\\(California_politician\\) \"Frank Osborne\n\\(California politician\\)\") of [Alameda, California](/wiki/Alameda,_California\n\"Alameda, California\") via AT&T's [Bell System](/wiki/Bell_System \"Bell\nSystem\").[5] The [ten digit call](/wiki/10-digit_dialing \"10-digit dialing\")\n(seven digits plus a three-digit [area code](/wiki/Area_code \"Area code\")) was\nconnected automatically within 18 seconds.[6]\n\nThe first [subscriber trunk dialling](/wiki/Subscriber_trunk_dialling\n\"Subscriber trunk dialling\") in the United Kingdom was deployed December 5,\n1958 with [Elizabeth II](/wiki/Elizabeth_II \"Elizabeth II\") placing a call\nfrom [Bristol](/wiki/Bristol \"Bristol\") to [Edinburgh](/wiki/Edinburgh\n\"Edinburgh\").[7]\n\n**International calling**\n\nAfter [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), priority was given by\n[AT&T](/wiki/AT%26T \"AT&T\") in the USA and the various\n[PTT](/wiki/Postal_Telephone_and_Telegraph \"Postal Telephone and Telegraph\")\nentities in Europe to automating switching on the\n[toll](/wiki/Toll_\\(telecommunications\\) \"Toll \\(telecommunications\\)\")\nnetworks in their respective countries (initially for [Operator Toll\nDialing](/wiki/Operator_Toll_Dialing \"Operator Toll Dialing\")). Thus, when\n[TAT-1](/wiki/TAT-1 \"TAT-1\") was opened for service, it was connected to\ninternational gateway offices at [White Plains, NY](/wiki/White_Plains,_NY\n\"White Plains, NY\") and [London](/wiki/London \"London\") that were already\nautomated for _domestic_ calls. These were designed to be able to\nautomatically switch outward and inward international circuits as soon as\ncommon signalling standards (and political considerations) could be\nnegotiated. However, at the outset, to set up an international call, multiple\noperators were required: one to originate the call and one at each national\ngateway to complete a call via either [ringdown](/wiki/Ringdown \"Ringdown\") to\na local operator or [operator toll dialing](/wiki/Operator_Toll_Dialing\n\"Operator Toll Dialing\").\n\n[International Direct Dialling](/wiki/International_Direct_Dialling\n\"International Direct Dialling\") from [London](/wiki/London \"London\") to\n[Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\") was first offered in March 1963, with\n[Amsterdam](/wiki/Amsterdam \"Amsterdam\") following by the end of 1963.\nSimultaneously, operator-dialed transatlantic calling began March 30, 1963\nwith the originating international operator in Western Europe or the USA able\nto complete calls to the terminal station without further operator assistance\nvia the gateway exchanges at [White Plains, NY](/wiki/White_Plains,_NY \"White\nPlains, NY\") and [London](/wiki/London \"London\").[8] Operator-dialed\ntranspacific calling to Hawaii, Japan, and Australia began with the completion\nof the [COMPAC](/wiki/COMPAC \"COMPAC\") cable, also in 1963.[8]\n\nBy mid-1968, transatlantic cable capacity had increased to the point where\nscheduling calls between Western Europe, the UK, and USA was no longer\nnecessary and calls were completed on demand. Transatlantic [International\nDirect Dialing](/wiki/International_Direct_Dialing \"International Direct\nDialing\") between [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") (212\n[area code](/wiki/Area_code \"Area code\")) and [London](/wiki/London \"London\")\n(01 [STD code](/wiki/STD_code \"STD code\")) was introduced in 1970,[9] with\nservice extended to the whole of the USA and the 6 largest UK cities in\n1971.[10]\n\n**Collect/Reverse Charge calling**\n\nVarious schemes were devised to allow large organisations to automatically\naccept [collect calls](/wiki/Collect_call \"Collect call\"), where the recipient\npays long-distance charges for any call from a predefined area. A [Zenith\nnumber](/wiki/Zenith_number \"Zenith number\") in the late 1950s required an\noperator manually determine the destination number from a printed list; the\n1967 [Wide Area Telephone Service](/wiki/Wide_Area_Telephone_Service \"Wide\nArea Telephone Service\") introduced the first automated [toll-free telephone\nnumbers](/wiki/Toll-free_telephone_number \"Toll-free telephone number\"),\nterminated on special fixed-rate trunks. By the 1980s, computerisation of the\nsystem allowed [British Telecom](/wiki/British_Telecom \"British Telecom\")\n\"Linkline\" 0800 freephone numbers and [AT&T](/wiki/AT%26T \"AT&T\") +1-800-\ntoll-free numbers to be controlled by a database and terminated virtually\nanywhere with each inbound call itemised and billed individually. This smart\nnetwork was further refined to provide [toll-free number\nportability](/wiki/Toll-free_number_portability \"Toll-free number\nportability\") in the 1990s.\n\n**Technical Issues**\n\nUntil the early 1980s a called party could instantly recognize an incoming\nlong-distance call by its hiss or low level, due to the inherent signal loss\nand introduction of noise. The deployment of digital technologies such as\n[pulse-code modulation](/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation \"Pulse-code modulation\")\nand [T-carrier](/wiki/T-carrier \"T-carrier\") circuits in the 1970s and 1980s\nlet long-distance calls match the high voice quality of local\ncalls.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nImprovements in switching technology, the deployment of high-capacity [optical\nfibre](/wiki/Optical_fibre \"Optical fibre\") and an increase in competition\nsubstantially lowered long-distance rates at the end of the 20th century.\nUsing the [Internet](/wiki/Voice_over_IP \"Voice over IP\"), the distinction\nbetween local and long-distance communication is fading to the point where an\nInternet call from the United States to [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing \"Beijing\")\ncarries a [lower wholesale cost](/wiki/Traffic_pumping \"Traffic pumping\") than\na domestic landline call to a rural\n[independent](/wiki/Independent_telephone_company \"Independent telephone\ncompany\") in small-town [Iowa](/wiki/Iowa \"Iowa\").\n\n## In media[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Long-\ndistance_calling&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: In media\")]\n\n**Dramatization of a long distance call circa 1949**\n\n    \n\n![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkqAcAAIUAgUW0RjgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)\n\n[](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4b/Long_distance_call_Dragnet_1954.ogg)\n\nIn this excerpt from the radio series [Dragnet](/wiki/Dragnet_\\(series\\)\n\"Dragnet \\(series\\)\"), Sgt. Joe Friday ([Jack Webb](/wiki/Jack_Webb \"Jack\nWebb\")) places a [person-to-person](/wiki/Operator_assistance \"Operator\nassistance\") long-distance call to a number reached via a manual switchboard\nin [Fountain Green](/wiki/Fountain_Green,_Utah \"Fountain Green, Utah\"),\n[Utah](/wiki/Utah \"Utah\") — a town of several hundred people served by an\n[independent telephone company](/wiki/Independent_telephone_company\n\"Independent telephone company\"). In the call, Friday calls a long-distance\noperator in [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\") and gives the name\nand number of the called party. The operator then calls a rate & route\noperator, who responds that the call should be routed through [Salt Lake\nCity](/wiki/Salt_Lake_City \"Salt Lake City\") and [Mount\nPleasant](/wiki/Mount_Pleasant,_Utah \"Mount Pleasant, Utah\"), Utah and the\nrate-step for the call is 140 (the long distance operator would mark her\nticket with that rate-step, and could use it to quote the rate from her rate\ntable, in terms of the first three minutes and each additional minute, if the\ncaller requested the toll).\n\nThe Los Angeles long distance operator then plugs into a direct trunk to the\nSalt Lake City inward operator and asks her for Mount Pleasant; the Salt Lake\noperator rings Mount Pleasant inward, and the Los Angeles operator asks the\nMount Pleasant inward operator for Fountain Green. The Mount Pleasant operator\nnext rings Fountain Green, and the Los Angeles operator gives the Fountain\nGreen operator the number and name of the called party in Fountain Green. The\nFountain Green operator rings the number, \"14R2\", a [party\nline](/wiki/Party_line_\\(telephony\\) \"Party line \\(telephony\\)\") where a\nspecific [ringing pattern](/wiki/Distinctive_ring \"Distinctive ring\") summons\nthe second subscriber on the shared line. A man answers; the Los Angeles\noperator asks for the called party and states that Los Angeles is calling.\n\nThis dramatization (and others like it) illustrates the cumbersome, costly and\ntime-consuming process needed for long-distance calling before direct distance\ndialing was available. Local calls within the Los Angeles area had long been\ndirect dial, but a long distance call to a tiny town in a distant state was a\ncomplex manual effort. The caller would dial the [long-distance\noperator](/wiki/Long-distance_operator \"Long-distance operator\") (typically\n‘112’ in large Bell System cities of that era; \"0\" was for local assistance)\nand provide the destination city name and called number as well as their own\nnumber for billing purposes (there was no [automatic number\nidentification](/wiki/Automatic_number_identification \"Automatic number\nidentification\")). Before the era of operator assisted dialing, which began in\nthe late 1940s, an operator would first set up the route, then ring back the\noriginal caller several minutes later to announce the call was ready, rather\nthan having him or her remain on the line.\n\nOnce operator distance dialing was implemented, the operator would have\nreceived a numerical routing from the rate and route operator, such as \"Mark:\nOther Place. Route: A ring-down. Numbers: 801 plus 073 plus 181. Operators 801\nplus 073 plus.\" This routing would allow the Los Angeles operator to dial via\nthe tandem switch (_i.e._ , [class-4 telephone\nswitch](/wiki/Class-4_telephone_switch \"Class-4 telephone switch\")) to the\nMount Pleasant operator’s switchboard, and have the call come in on a special\nspecial trunk (designated by the 181 code) used for incoming calls to ring-\ndown points (places with manual service whose connection to the national\nnetwork was via a larger point).\n\nRoutings were important during the 1950s and 1960s, when many medium-sized and\nsmaller cities had automatic service, but were not yet reachable by the\ngrowing numbers of people in cities with direct dialing. For example, if by\nthe late 1950s, our fictional \"Fountain Green\" had upgraded its manual service\nwith an automatic (dial enabled four-digit number) one, an operator could\noften dial the call after obtaining the Rate and Route would quote (\"Numbers\n801 plus 833 plus 4D. Operators 801 plus 073 plus.\"). The operator could add\n833, to the local four digit number, which in a few years, would become the\nseven digit number for the residents.\n\n## Regional variations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Long-\ndistance_calling&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Regional variations\")]\n\nThe definition of \"local\" or \"long distance\" calling (and the corresponding\npricing) is largely a regulatory construct, by which every point outside an\narbitrary group of exchange boundaries is charged at a higher \"trunk call\" or\n\"toll call\" rate. The charges often do not correlate directly to either\nstraight-line distance or network topology; two exchanges 75 km apart may be\nlocal in some cases, while in other cases an adjacent pair of exchanges (or\neven two different exchange prefixes on the same physical switch) may\narbitrarily be long-distance.\n\n### Canada[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Long-\ndistance_calling&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Canada\")]\n\nIn [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\"), local calls from landline telephones are\nflat-rated even in the largest cities (unlike the [United\nStates](/wiki/United_States_of_America \"United States of America\"), which has\nmetered service in a few of the largest markets). Local telephone numbers were\nlengthened to a standard seven digits in all of the largest markets in 1958 to\naccommodate US-style direct-dial equipment ([Montréal](/wiki/Montr%C3%A9al\n\"Montréal\") and [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\") previously had 2L+4N six-\ndigit local calling, smaller communities had four or five digits).\n\nLong distance calling from landlines was opened to competition in the early\n1990s and the use of long distance revenue to subsidise local service phased\nout a few years later. It is not possible for [mobile\ntelephone](/wiki/Mobile_telephone \"Mobile telephone\") subscribers or [coin-\npaid](/wiki/Coin_phone \"Coin phone\") telephone users to select a default\ncarrier, so long distance calls are often priced higher from these services.\nThe use of prepaid telephone calling cards is a possible workaround.\n\n### United Kingdom[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Long-\ndistance_calling&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: United Kingdom\")]\n\nThe regulatory structure in [British Telecom](/wiki/British_Telecom \"British\nTelecom\") exchanges differs from the [North\nAmerican](/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan \"North American Numbering Plan\")\nsystem as there are no free local calls. A long-distance call is therefore\nknown not as a \"toll call\" but as a [trunk call](/wiki/Trunk_call \"Trunk\ncall\"). It traditionally carried a higher rate (\"national rate\" instead of\n\"local rate\") and requires a [trunk prefix](/wiki/Trunk_prefix \"Trunk prefix\")\nand [area code](/wiki/Area_code \"Area code\") be dialled before the number. A\ntrunk call is prefixed with '0' for national calls and '00' for international\ncalls, the [European](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\") standard. It is\nnow normal for local calls to cost the same as long distance UK calls, and is\nnow common, for a small extra monthly charge, to allow free calls to landlines\nwithin the UK. This free call allowance does not normally cover calls to the\n[Isle of Man](/wiki/Isle_of_Man \"Isle of Man\") or the [Channel\nIslands](/wiki/Channel_Islands \"Channel Islands\"), which whilst confusingly\nhaving UK national dialling codes, are separate telephone administrations.\n\nInternational calling from the UK is deregulated in that many alternative\nproviders allow very cheap international calling by the caller dialling an\naccess code, usually beginning with the digit 1, followed by the full\ninternational code. These services generally use internet-based connections in\nthe same way as computer-based services such as [Skype](/wiki/Skype \"Skype\"),\nFriend Caller and many others, but with the added convenience of there being\nno need to use a computer. It is this use of the internet for the calls which\nallows such low prices. Often these same services are available from a mobile\nphone by the use of a special access number, though in this case there may be\na charge equivalent to that of a standard landline call.\n\n### United States[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Long-\ndistance_calling&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: United States\")]\n\nThe US regulatory structure splits long-distance calls into two major\ncategories. An intrastate call is regulated under state law. Federal\nregulation applies to interstate calls (being [interstate\ncommerce](/wiki/Commerce_clause \"Commerce clause\")).\n\nIn 1968, the [Federal Communications\nCommission](/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission \"Federal Communications\nCommission\") forced AT&T to allow [MCI](/wiki/MCI_Communications \"MCI\nCommunications\") to connect their own long distance lines into the Bell\nsystem.[11]\n\nDuring the 1984 [breakup of the Bell System](/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System\n\"Breakup of the Bell System\"), the _local access and transport area_ or\n[LATA](/wiki/LATA \"LATA\") concept was created to distinguish between in-region\ncalls (which were handled by [local telephone companies](/wiki/ILEC \"ILEC\")\nsuch as the Baby Bells) and out-of-region calls (handled by [interexchange\ncarriers](/wiki/Interexchange_carrier \"Interexchange carrier\") such as AT&T,\n[MCI](/wiki/MCI_Communications \"MCI Communications\") and\n[Sprint](/wiki/Sprint_Corporation \"Sprint Corporation\")).\n\nThe breakup of the Bell system in 1984 came with federally imposed rules to\nallow the Baby Bells and other long-distance providers to compete via \"equal\naccess.\" Equal access allows telephone subscribers to choose an authorized\ntelephone company or companies to handle their local toll and long-distance\ntoll (including international) calls from their traditional, wireline\ntelephones.\n\nVarious [feature groups](/wiki/Feature_group \"Feature group\") were used where\nequal access is available to allow callers to select a long-distance carrier\nfor each call. In feature group 'D', the current system, subscribers may dial\nthe prefix \"101\" and a four-digit code identifying a long-distance carrier to\nhandle the InterLATA call. For instance, 1010288 sends a call via AT&T,\n1010333 is Sprint, 1010550 goes to CenturyLink. [Area code\n700](/wiki/Area_code_700 \"Area code 700\"), rarely used, is reserved for\ncarrier-specific services; each carrier places a recorded self-identification\nmessage on 1-700-555-4141 to allow a subscriber to identify the default\nInterLATA carrier for their line.\n\nIn the United States, long-distance is either of two different classes of\ncalls that are not local calls. The most common class of long-distance is\noften called _interstate long-distance_ , though the more accurate term is\n_inter-LATA interstate long-distance_. This is the form of long-distance most\ncommonly meant by the term, and the one for which [long-distance\ncarriers](/wiki/Long-distance_carrier \"Long-distance carrier\") are usually\nchosen by telephone customers.\n\nAnother form of long-distance, increasingly relevant to more U.S. states, is\nknown as _inter-LATA**intra** state long-distance_. This refers to a calling\narea outside of the customer’s LATA but within the customer's state. While\ntechnically and legally long-distance, this calling area is not necessarily\nserved by the same carrier used for \"regular\" long-distance, or may be\nprovided at different rates. In some cases, customer confusion occurs as, due\nto rate or carrier distinctions, a local long-distance call can be billed at a\nhigher per-minute rate than interstate long-distance calls, despite being a\nshorter distance.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nOften, in large LATAs, there is also a class known by the\n[oxymoronic](/wiki/Oxymoron \"Oxymoron\") name _local long-distance_ , which\nrefers to calls within the customer's LATA but outside their local calling\narea. This area is normally served by the customer's local telephone provider,\nwhich is usually one of the [Baby Bells](/wiki/RBOC \"RBOC\"), despite attempts\nby some [CLECs](/wiki/Competitive_local_exchange_carrier \"Competitive local\nexchange carrier\") to compete in the local telephone market.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn California, in addition to intra-LATA and inter-LATA calling, there are ZUM\n([Zone Usage Measurement](/wiki/Zone_Usage_Measurement \"Zone Usage\nMeasurement\")) areas within the local Service Areas.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nCallers are usually offered a variety of rate \"plans\" depending on usage,\nalthough which plan is cheapest for a given amount of usage is often not\nobvious. Plans may be \"unlimited\" or may package an initial number of minutes\nand charge additional minutes at a flat rate, and further varieties abound.\nSome plans can be compared easily if the number of minutes of usage will be\nestimated in advance, but others are not as clearly comparable. Some of these\nplans can be found on websites that compare a variety of long-distance phone\nand phone card options, giving consumers useful and timely\ninformation.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Long-\ndistance_calling&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * [AT&T Long Lines](/wiki/AT%26T_Communications#AT.26T_Long_Lines \"AT&T Communications\")\n  * [Long-haul communications](/wiki/Long-haul_communications \"Long-haul communications\")\n  * [Toll restriction](/wiki/Toll_restriction \"Toll restriction\")\n  * [Trunk vs Toll](/wiki/Trunk_vs_Toll \"Trunk vs Toll\")\n  * [Voice over Internet Protocol](/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_Protocol \"Voice over Internet Protocol\") is often used to reduce the costs of long-distance services\n  * [Interexchange carrier](/wiki/Interexchange_carrier \"Interexchange carrier\")\n    * [Carrier access code](/wiki/Carrier_access_code \"Carrier access code\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Long-\ndistance_calling&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** Eisenberg, Daniel (1989).
