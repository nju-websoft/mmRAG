It was the first time that these two teams had met\nat this stage of a World Cup. For defending champions Australia it was their\nfifth World Cup final, while for India it was the second after their [1983\nvictory](/wiki/1983_Cricket_World_Cup_Final \"1983 Cricket World Cup Final\").\nAustralia won the match by 125 [runs](/wiki/Run_\\(cricket\\) \"Run \\(cricket\\)\")\nto claim the title for the third time.\n\nBoth teams had progressed through three stages to reach the final. Australia\nwas unbeaten thus far, while India had lost one game—against Australia in the\nfirst stage. Australia—led by [Ricky Ponting](/wiki/Ricky_Ponting \"Ricky\nPonting\")—entered the game as firm favourites. After winning the\n[toss](/wiki/Toss_\\(cricket\\) \"Toss \\(cricket\\)\"), India captain [Sourav\nGanguly](/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly \"Sourav Ganguly\") decided to field first before\na crowd of nearly 32,000. The Australian opening pair, [Adam\nGilchrist](/wiki/Adam_Gilchrist \"Adam Gilchrist\") and [Matthew\nHayden](/wiki/Matthew_Hayden \"Matthew Hayden\"), added 105 runs in 14\n[overs](/wiki/Over_\\(cricket\\) \"Over \\(cricket\\)\").

[Harbhajan Singh](/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh\n\"Harbhajan Singh\") took both of the Australian [wickets](/wiki/Wickets\n\"Wickets\"), conceding 49 runs.\n\nIn response, India lost their key batsman, [Sachin\nTendulkar](/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar \"Sachin Tendulkar\"), at the start of the\ninnings. Despite a brief interruption by rain after the 17th over, no time was\nlost from the game. Once play resumed, India lost wickets at regular\nintervals. [Virender Sehwag](/wiki/Virender_Sehwag \"Virender Sehwag\") top-\nscored for India with 82 runs, before the team were bowled out for 234 runs in\nthe 40th over. For Australia, [Glenn McGrath](/wiki/Glenn_McGrath \"Glenn\nMcGrath\") took three wickets for 52 runs, while [Brett Lee](/wiki/Brett_Lee\n\"Brett Lee\") and [Andrew Symonds](/wiki/Andrew_Symonds \"Andrew Symonds\")\nclaimed two wickets each. Ponting was named [man of the\nmatch](/wiki/Man_of_the_match \"Man of the match\") for his 140, and Tendulkar,\nthe tournament's leading run-scorer (673 runs), was awarded the man of the\nseries. The final was Australia's seventeenth successive ODI win, a record,\nand they were the first team to win three World Cups. Ganguly's decision to\nbowl first in the match was criticised by journalists and former cricketers.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Background\n    * 1.1 Format\n    * 1.2 Squads\n  * 2 Route to the final\n    * 2.1 Group stage\n    * 2.2 Super Sixes\n    * 2.3 Semi-finals\n  * 3 Build up\n  * 4 Final\n    * 4.1 Summary\n    * 4.2 Scorecard\n  * 5 Aftermath\n  * 6 See also\n  * 7 Notes\n  * 8 References\n  * 9 Sources\n  * 10 External links\n\n##\nBackground[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: Background\")]\n\n###\nFormat[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Format\")]\n\nSee also: [History of the Cricket World\nCup](/wiki/History_of_the_Cricket_World_Cup \"History of the Cricket World\nCup\")\n\nThe [2003 Cricket World Cup](/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup \"2003 Cricket World\nCup\") was the eighth [World Cup](/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup \"Cricket World Cup\"),\norganised by the [International Cricket\nCouncil](/wiki/International_Cricket_Council \"International Cricket Council\")\n(ICC). The competition took place between 9 February and 23 March 2003,\nlasting 43 days. Co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, the tournament\nwas the first World Cup to be played in Africa.[3] There were 14 participating\nteams, the largest number in a World Cup until then. As well as the 10 Test-\nplaying nations, four associate teams took part.\n[Kenya](/wiki/Kenya_national_cricket_team \"Kenya national cricket team\"), by\nvirtue of its ODI status, automatically qualified for the tournament;\n[Canada](/wiki/Canada_national_cricket_team \"Canada national cricket team\"),\n[Namibia](/wiki/Namibia_national_cricket_team \"Namibia national cricket team\")\nand [Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands_national_cricket_team \"Netherlands\nnational cricket team\")—the top three teams of the [2001 ICC\nTrophy](/wiki/2001_ICC_Trophy \"2001 ICC Trophy\")—formed the rest.[4]\n\nThe structure of the tournament was similar to that of the [1999 World\nCup](/wiki/1999_Cricket_World_Cup \"1999 Cricket World Cup\"). The 14 countries\nwere separated into two groups of seven; each team played the others in its\ngroup once. The most successful three from each group qualified for the Super\nSixes stage,[4] a format which was introduced in the 1999 tournament.[3] Each\nqualifier carried forward their points from the first stage and played one\ngame against each of the three teams from the other group. The top four teams\nfrom the Super Sixes qualified for the semi-finals, and the winners of those\nmatches contested the final. A total of 54 matches were played in the\ntournament.[5]\n\nThe matches were played according to the standard rules of a [One Day\nInternational](/wiki/One_Day_International \"One Day International\") (ODI).\nEach side batted for a maximum of 50 overs,[b][7] and fielding restrictions\napplied for the bowling side. For the first 15 overs only two fielders were\nallowed outside the\n[infield](/wiki/Fielding_restrictions_\\(cricket\\)#Men.27s_Fielding_Restriction_Circles\n\"Fielding restrictions \\(cricket\\)\"), and for the rest of the innings four\nfielders (including a bowler and the [wicket-keeper](/wiki/Wicket-keeper\n\"Wicket-keeper\")) had to be deployed in the infield. No player was allowed to\nbowl more than 10 overs in an innings.[8]\n\n###\nSquads[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Squads\")]\n\nMain article: [2003 Cricket World Cup\nsquads](/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup_squads \"2003 Cricket World Cup squads\")\n\nThe [Australian Cricket Board](/wiki/Australian_Cricket_Board \"Australian\nCricket Board\") announced their squad for the World Cup on 31 December 2002,\nbut several changes were made to the team before the tournament was completed.\nIn January 2003, [Shane Watson](/wiki/Shane_Watson \"Shane Watson\") was ruled\nout following a [stress fracture](/wiki/Stress_fracture \"Stress fracture\") and\nwas replaced by [Ian Harvey](/wiki/Ian_Harvey \"Ian Harvey\").[9] A day before\nthe tournament started, Australia's key [spinner](/wiki/Spin_bowling \"Spin\nbowling\") [Shane Warne](/wiki/Shane_Warne \"Shane Warne\") was found guilty of\nusing a prohibited [diuretic](/wiki/Diuretic \"Diuretic\") drug during an ODI\nseries held in Australia before the World Cup. He was sent home after he\ntested positive, and banned from playing for one year.[10][11] Later,\nAustralia's fast bowler [Jason Gillespie](/wiki/Jason_Gillespie \"Jason\nGillespie\") was ruled out from the tournament following a tendon injury.[12]\nWarne and Gillespie were replaced by [Nathan Hauritz](/wiki/Nathan_Hauritz\n\"Nathan Hauritz\") (on 24 February 2003) and [Nathan\nBracken](/wiki/Nathan_Bracken \"Nathan Bracken\") (on 5 March 2003),\nrespectively.[13][14] An ongoing dispute between the [Board for Control of\nCricket in India](/wiki/Board_for_Control_of_Cricket_in_India \"Board for\nControl of Cricket in India\") (BCCI) and the Indian players over product\nendorsements ensured a delay in the announcement of a provisional squad for\nthe World Cup.[15] The BCCI announced the final selection of 15 members on 31\nDecember 2002.[16] [Sachin Tendulkar](/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar \"Sachin\nTendulkar\") made into the final squad despite three ongoing injuries,\nincluding a major one on the ankle.[17]\n\nHaving won 15 out of their 18 ODIs leading up the start of the tournament, the\ndefending champions Australia were deemed one of the favourites to reach the\nsemi-finals.[18] They had previously won the\n[1987](/wiki/1987_Cricket_World_Cup \"1987 Cricket World Cup\") and 1999\ntournaments. In contrast, some commentators considered it doubtful whether\nIndia would qualify for the Super Sixes stage.

Australia won all\ntheir matches in the group stage. Except for their win against England, when\nthey recovered from 135 for 8 to reach the target of 205\n[runs](/wiki/Run_\\(cricket\\) \"Run \\(cricket\\)\"), they won all their matches\ncomfortably.[12]\n\nIndia had a shaky start to the tournament.[12] In their opening match against\nthe [Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands_cricket_team \"Netherlands cricket team\"),\nthey were bowled out for 204 runs. Although they won the game by 79 runs, the\nteam was criticised for failing to bat out their 50 overs.[21] After they were\ndismissed for 125 runs against Australia and lost the match by nine wickets,\nangry fans in India burned effigies of the players; [Mohammad\nKaif](/wiki/Mohammad_Kaif \"Mohammad Kaif\")'s house and [Rahul\nDravid](/wiki/Rahul_Dravid \"Rahul Dravid\")'s car were vandalised.[22][23]\nIndia won all the remaining games of the stage—against Zimbabwe, Pakistan,\nNamibia and England.[17]\n\nAustralia, India and Zimbabwe finished the group as the top three teams and\nqualified for the Super Sixes from Pool A,[19] while Pool B had Sri Lanka,\nKenya and New Zealand progress for the next stage.[12]\n\n### Super\nSixes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Super Sixes\")]\n\nIn the first match of the Super Sixes against Sri Lanka, Australia made 319\nruns for five wickets.

[Aravinda\nde Silva](/wiki/Aravinda_de_Silva \"Aravinda de Silva\") top-scored with 92\nwhile [Brett Lee](/wiki/Brett_Lee \"Brett Lee\") captured three wickets for\nAustralia.[25] In the next match against New Zealand, [Shane\nBond](/wiki/Shane_Bond \"Shane Bond\")'s six wickets for 23 runs reduced\nAustralia to 84 runs for seven wickets in 27 overs before [Michael\nBevan](/wiki/Michael_Bevan \"Michael Bevan\") and [Andrew\nBichel](/wiki/Andrew_Bichel \"Andrew Bichel\") took the total to 208 runs.[26]\nLee's five wickets for 42 runs helped to bowl New Zealand out for 112 runs,\ntheir lowest total in World Cup.[27] Australia won their final game by five\nwickets after bowling out Kenya for 174 runs.[28]\n\nAfter losing the toss against Kenya in their first match, India were set a\ntarget of 226 runs. Despite an initial collapse, their captain [Sourav\nGanguly](/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly \"Sourav Ganguly\") (107 not out) and [Yuvraj\nSingh](/wiki/Yuvraj_Singh \"Yuvraj Singh\") (58 not out) ensured India's\nvictory.[29] In the next game against Sri Lanka, India made 292 runs;\nTendulkar (97) and Sehwag (66) top-scored for the team. Srinath took four\nwickets as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 109, and India won the match by a\nmargin of 183 runs.[30] In their final match of the stage, India played New\nZealand. [Zaheer Khan](/wiki/Zaheer_Khan \"Zaheer Khan\") returned career-best\n[figures](/wiki/Bowling_analysis \"Bowling analysis\") of four wickets for 42\nruns, and New Zealand were dismissed for 146 runs. India lost three wickets\nfor 21 runs, before Dravid, their vice-captain,[16] and Kaif added 129 runs\nfor the fourth wicket and ensured a seven-wicket win. The match marked the\nseventh consecutive victory for India in the tournament.[31]\n\n### Semi-\nfinals[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=7\n\"Edit section: Semi-finals\")]\n\nThe first semi-final was played between Australia and Sri Lanka on 18 March at\n[St. George's Park](/wiki/St_George%27s_Park,_Port_Elizabeth \"St George's\nPark, Port Elizabeth\"), [Port Elizabeth](/wiki/Port_Elizabeth \"Port\nElizabeth\"). Australia won the toss and opted to bat first. They managed 212\nruns for the loss of 7 wickets at the end of 50 overs. Symonds top-scored for\nthe team with 91 [not out](/wiki/Not_out_\\(cricket\\) \"Not out \\(cricket\\)\"),\nwhile [Chaminda Vaas](/wiki/Chaminda_Vaas \"Chaminda Vaas\") picked up three\nwickets for Sri Lanka.[32] With 213 runs needed for victory, Sri Lanka lost\nboth the openers after which the play was interrupted by rain. The target was\nrevised to 172 runs from 38.1 overs using the [Duckworth–Lewis\nmethod](/wiki/Duckworth%E2%80%93Lewis_method \"Duckworth–Lewis method\"), a\nmathematical formulation used to calculate revised targets for teams batting\nsecond in case of matches being interrupted by bad weather or rain.[33] [Kumar\nSangakkara](/wiki/Kumar_Sangakkara \"Kumar Sangakkara\") and Vaas made 47 runs\ntogether for the eighth wicket, the highest partnership of the innings, but\nthe team managed to score only 123 runs in the allotted overs. Australia\nprogressed into the final as Sri Lanka fell 48 runs short of the target.[34]\n\nThe second semi-final was played between India and Kenya on 20 March 2003 at\n[Kingsmead](/wiki/Kingsmead_Cricket_Ground \"Kingsmead Cricket Ground\"),\n[Durban](/wiki/Durban \"Durban\"). Kenya became the first non-Test team to play\na World Cup semi-final.[35][36] India won the toss and made 270 runs for four\nwickets. Ganguly and Tendulkar made 111 not out and 83 respectively.[37] In\nreply, Kenya were bowled out for 179 in 46.2 overs. Their captain Steve Tikolo\ntop-scored with 56 runs, while Zaheer Khan took three wickets for 14 runs.\nGanguly was adjudged the [Man of the match](/wiki/Man_of_the_match \"Man of the\nmatch\").[38]\n\n## Build\nup[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=8\n\"Edit section: Build up\")]\n\nMany journalists considered Australia, undefeated throughout the tournament,\nto be favourites in the final.[39][40] The Indian industrialist [Vijay\nMallya](/wiki/Vijay_Mallya \"Vijay Mallya\") organised special flights,\nincluding a few [chartered ones](/wiki/Air_charter \"Air charter\"), to\ntransport film actors, politicians and businessmen to\n[Johannesburg](/wiki/Johannesburg \"Johannesburg\");[41] most of these people\nsupported India. Some South African airlines also extended their support to\nIndia.[42] The air tickets from Mumbai to Johannesburg were completely sold\nout immediately after India entered the Super Sixes stage.[43] Although most\njournalists and analysts favoured Australia, former [Pakistan\ncaptain](/wiki/List_of_Pakistan_national_cricket_captains \"List of Pakistan\nnational cricket captains\") [Imran Khan](/wiki/Imran_Khan \"Imran Khan\")\nbelieved India were favourites. Former Australia cricketer [Greg\nChappell](/wiki/Greg_Chappell \"Greg Chappell\") complimented Brett Lee: he\nsaid, except for Lee, no Australian bowler was a serious threat to the Indian\nbatsmen, and also remarked that the \"duel\" between Lee and Tendulkar would be\ncrucial.[44]\n\nOn the eve of the match, which would be his 100th ODI as India's captain,\nGanguly issued a statement saying that his team were honoured to play the\nWorld Cup final. He cited India's victories at the 1983 World Cup and the 1985\nWorld Championship of Cricket as his inspirations.[45] Although acknowledging\nAustralia as the best side in the world, he stated that they were not\n\"unbeatable\".[46] Australia's main concern was Tendulkar, the tournament's\ntop-scorer, of whom the Indian fans had high expectations.[12] Ponting hinted\nabout the possibility that his bowlers, Lee and [Glenn\nMcGrath](/wiki/Glenn_McGrath \"Glenn McGrath\"), had \"special\" plans to restrict\nhim.[46] He also said that in crucial matches his team \"tries to reach another\nlevel\".[47]\n\nBefore the match, the two teams had faced each other eight times in World\nCups; Australia had won six of them.[48] In the 2003 tournament, Australia won\nall their matches to that point; India's only defeat came in the group stage\nagainst Australia.[c][47] For all the Indian players it was their first World\nCup final, whereas six of the Australians had appeared in at least one\nprevious final.[49]\n\n|  [![Sachin\nTendulkar](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Sachin_Tendulkar.jpg/180px-\nSachin_Tendulkar.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sachin_Tendulkar.jpg \"India's Sachin\nTendulkar was the tournament's top-scorer with 673 runs.\")  \n---  \nIndia's [Sachin Tendulkar](/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar \"Sachin Tendulkar\") was the\ntournament's top-scorer with 673 runs.  \n[![Sourav\nGanguly](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Sourav_Ganguly_crop.jpg/142px-\nSourav_Ganguly_crop.jpg)](/wiki/File:Sourav_Ganguly_crop.jpg \"India captain\nSourav Ganguly was the second-highest run scorer in the tournament.\")  \n---  \nIndia captain [Sourav Ganguly](/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly \"Sourav Ganguly\") was the\nsecond-highest run scorer in the tournament.  \n[![Ricky\nPonting](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Ricky_Ponting_helmet.jpg/155px-\nRicky_Ponting_helmet.jpg)](/wiki/File:Ricky_Ponting_helmet.jpg \"Australia\ncaptain Ricky Ponting scored 415 runs in the tournament.\")  \n---  \nAustralia captain [Ricky Ponting](/wiki/Ricky_Ponting \"Ricky Ponting\") scored\n415 runs in the tournament.  \n[![Brett\nLee](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Australia_bowler_Brett_Lee.jpg/176px-\nAustralia_bowler_Brett_Lee.jpg)](/wiki/File:Australia_bowler_Brett_Lee.jpg\n\"Australia's Brett Lee was the tournament's second-highest wicket taker.\")  \n---  \nAustralia's Brett Lee was the tournament's second-highest wicket taker.  \n[![Andrew\nSymonds](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Andrew_symonds_closeup.jpg/180px-\nAndrew_symonds_closeup.jpg)](/wiki/File:Andrew_symonds_closeup.jpg \"Andrew\nSymonds played two important innings, each against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, to\nlead Australia to victory.\")  \n---  \n[Andrew Symonds](/wiki/Andrew_Symonds \"Andrew Symonds\") played two important\ninnings, each against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, to lead Australia to victory.  \n  \n##\nFinal[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=9\n\"Edit section: Final\")]\n\n###\nSummary[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=10\n\"Edit section: Summary\")]\n\nThe final was played on 23 March 2003 at the [Wanderers\nStadium](/wiki/Wanderers_Stadium \"Wanderers Stadium\"), Johannesburg. This was\nthe fifth match to be played at the ground in the tournament.[50] The match,\nwatched by a crowd of 31,779,[a] began at 10:00\n[SAST](/wiki/South_African_Standard_Time \"South African Standard Time\").[51]\n[Simon Wilde](/wiki/Simon_Wilde \"Simon Wilde\"), writing for the _[Wisden\nCricketers' Almanack](/wiki/Wisden_Cricketers%27_Almanack \"Wisden Cricketers'\nAlmanack\")_, said the venue was one of the \"most bountiful\" grounds for\nbatsmen.[12] However, on that day the [pitch](/wiki/Pitch_\\(cricket\\) \"Pitch\n\\(cricket\\)\") was moist and the outfield was damp as a result of the\nthunderstorms the previous evening. A short shower that morning forced the\nground staff to blow dry air over the pitch. The sky was overcast with a\nchance of further rainfall.[52] For the umpires—[David\nShepherd](/wiki/David_Shepherd_\\(umpire\\) \"David Shepherd \\(umpire\\)\") and\n[Steve Bucknor](/wiki/Steve_Bucknor \"Steve Bucknor\")—it was their third World\nCup Final.[53] [Rudi Koertzen](/wiki/Rudi_Koertzen \"Rudi Koertzen\") and [Billy\nBowden](/wiki/Billy_Bowden \"Billy Bowden\") were appointed as the\n[third](/wiki/Third_umpire \"Third umpire\") and [fourth](/wiki/Fourth_umpire\n\"Fourth umpire\") umpires, respectively.

Ganguly won the\ntoss and elected to field first.[52] Zaheer Khan opened the bowling for India\nalong with [Javagal Srinath](/wiki/Javagal_Srinath \"Javagal Srinath\"). The\nAustralian openers scored aggressively from the beginning of the innings as\nKhan conceded 15 runs in the first over.[54] Gilchrist in particular hit both\nKhan and Srinath for many runs and reached his 50 from 40 balls. When Ganguly\nturned to his spin bowlers as early as the tenth over, Gilchrist slowed his\nscoring rate. In the fourteenth over, when [Harbhajan\nSingh](/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh \"Harbhajan Singh\") was brought back to bowl,\nGilchrist (57 off 48 balls) tried to hit him over the [mid-\nwicket](/wiki/Fielding_\\(cricket\\)#midwicket \"Fielding \\(cricket\\)\"), but was\nbeaten by the ball's extra bounce and caught in the deep by [Virender\nSehwag](/wiki/Virender_Sehwag \"Virender Sehwag\").[54] The pair had added 105\nruns for the first wicket.[55] Harbhajan struck again in the twentieth over\nwhen he dismissed Hayden (37 runs off 54 balls), leaving the score at 125\nruns.[54]\n\nAfter Hayden's departure, Ponting was joined by Martyn, who completed his\nhalf-century in 46 balls.[55] Ponting scored at a slower rate, reaching his 50\noff 74 balls with one four. After completing his half century, he accelerated;\nhe hit two [sixes](/wiki/Six_\\(cricket\\) \"Six \\(cricket\\)\") off Harbhajan and\none off [Ashish Nehra](/wiki/Ashish_Nehra \"Ashish Nehra\").[55] The pair added\n100 runs off 109 balls for the third wicket. Ponting reached his century\nquickly—his second fifty came off 29 balls.[55] At the end of the innings,\nAustralia had scored 359 runs for two wickets;[d] Ponting had scored 140 not\nout (off 121 balls; four [fours](/wiki/Four_\\(cricket\\) \"Four \\(cricket\\)\")\nand eight sixes)[e] and Martyn hit 88 not out (off 84 balls; seven fours and\none six) respectively. As of the [2015\ncompetition](/wiki/2015_Cricket_World_Cup \"2015 Cricket World Cup\"), Ponting's\ninnings remains the highest individual score by a captain in a World Cup\nfinal,[56] and Australia's total remains the highest by a team in a World Cup\nfinal. The 234-run stand between Ponting and Marytn was a record partnership\nfor Australia in ODIs at that point in time.[f] The Indian bowlers conceded 37\n[extras](/wiki/Extra_\\(cricket\\) \"Extra \\(cricket\\)\"). Srinath conceded 87\nruns without taking a wicket—the most expensive figures in his career—in what\nwas his last international game.[54]\n\nIndia came out to bat with Tendulkar and Sehwag. McGrath opened the bowling\nfor Australia. Tendulkar hit a boundary off the fourth ball of the over but\nwas dismissed off the next delivery.[54] Ganguly joined Sehwag and the pair\nscored at a run-a-ball before the former was dismissed by Lee in the tenth\nover. Kaif, the next man, was dismissed in the same over with the score 59\nruns for 3 wickets. Dravid and Sehwag scored steadily from then on until the\nseventeenth over,[21] when rain interrupted play with the score at 103\nruns.[54] After play resumed, Ponting brought in Australia's spinners, [Brad\nHogg](/wiki/Brad_Hogg \"Brad Hogg\") and [Darren Lehmann](/wiki/Darren_Lehmann\n\"Darren Lehmann\"). Sehwag was more aggressive against both, hitting Lehmann\nfor three consecutive fours and Hogg for a four and six; Dravid played a\nsecondary role to Sehwag, pushing often for singles. They were dismissed in\nquick succession after making 82 (off 81 balls) and 47 (off 57 balls)\nrespectively.[54] Following that, India began to lose wickets at regular\nintervals. Except for Yuvraj Singh (24) and Dinesh Mongia (12), the rest of\nthe players were out for single-digit scores.[54] India were bowled out for\n234 runs in 39.2 overs when Zaheer Khan was dismissed by McGrath.[58]\nAustralia won the match by 125 runs, the largest margin of victory by runs in\na World Cup final.[59] It was their second successive World Cup trophy and\ntheir third overall.[60] Ponting was declared the Man of the match for his 140\nnot out.[2]\n\n###\nScorecard[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=11\n\"Edit section: Scorecard\")]\n\n1st innings\n\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team \"Australia national cricket\nteam\") batting[1]  \n---  \nPlayer | Status | Runs | Balls | 4s | 6s | Strike rate  \n[Adam Gilchrist](/wiki/Adam_Gilchrist \"Adam Gilchrist\") ![dagger](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Dagger-14-plain.png) | c Sehwag b Harbhajan Singh | 57 | 48 | 8 | 1 | 118.75  \n[Matthew Hayden](/wiki/Matthew_Hayden \"Matthew Hayden\") | c Dravid b Harbhajan Singh | 37 | 54 | 5 | 0 | 68.51  \n[Ricky Ponting](/wiki/Ricky_Ponting \"Ricky Ponting\") * | not out | 140 | 121 | 4 | 8 | 115.70  \n[Damien Martyn](/wiki/Damien_Martyn \"Damien Martyn\") | not out | 88 | 84 | 7 | 1 | 104.76  \n[Darren Lehmann](/wiki/Darren_Lehmann \"Darren Lehmann\") |  |  |  |  |  |   \n[Michael Bevan](/wiki/Michael_Bevan \"Michael Bevan\") |  |  |  |  |  |   \n[Andrew Symonds](/wiki/Andrew_Symonds \"Andrew Symonds\") |  |  |  |  |  |   \n[Brad Hogg](/wiki/Brad_Hogg \"Brad Hogg\") |  |  |  |  |  |   \n[Andy Bichel](/wiki/Andy_Bichel \"Andy Bichel\") |  |  |  |  |  |   \n[Brett Lee](/wiki/Brett_Lee \"Brett Lee\") |  |  |  |  |  |   \n[Glenn McGrath](/wiki/Glenn_McGrath \"Glenn McGrath\") |  |  |  |  |  |   \nExtras | (b 2, lb 12, w 16, nb 7) | 37 |  |  |  |   \n**Total** | (2 wickets;

On Australia's win he said,\n\"It's not that we think we are ahead of the others. It's just the way we\nplay.\"[47] Nevertheless, he complimented both teams by saying that India and\nAustralia were the two best teams in the tournament, and said that the Indian\nplayers deserved to be in the final.[47] Ganguly praised the Australian\nbatsmen and said that they played like \"real champions\".[63]\n\nGanguly's decision to bowl first was criticised by the media: _[The New York\nTimes](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\")_ , for instance, said it\n\"backfired horribly\".[60][64] Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan, while\ndenouncing Ganguly's decision, also criticised his idea of going into the\nmatch with an unchanged side. He stated that India should have played their\n[leg spinner](/wiki/Leg_spin \"Leg spin\") [Anil Kumble](/wiki/Anil_Kumble \"Anil\nKumble\") as the ball was \"gripping [in] the surface\".[65] The journalist and\nformer England cricketer [Mike Selvey](/wiki/Mike_Selvey \"Mike Selvey\")\nbelieved that Ganguly may have been influenced by the possibility of the\nDuckworth–Lewis method affecting the result.[66] Indian journalist [Boria\nMajumdar](/wiki/Boria_Majumdar \"Boria Majumdar\") in his book, _Cricketing\nCultures in Conflict_ (2004), remarked about the possibility of Australia\nlosing the rain-interrupted final, if the result were to be decided by this\nmethod.[67] Ganguly defended his decision saying that the overcast conditions\nand moisture in the pitch meant it was favourable to the bowlers, but they\nfailed to use it properly.[52] Ponting said that he would have opted to bat\nfirst had they won the toss.[68] His teammate Symonds, in an interview later,\nrecalled that India's decision to bowl first gave them an impression that they\nwere not \"confident enough to take the fight\".[69]\n\nAustralia were rewarded with prize money totaling US$2,000,000, while India\nreceived $800,000.[35][70] Tendulkar's aggregate of 673 runs in the tournament\nfetched him the Man of the series accolade.[g][12] Ponting's innings of 140\nnot out was placed among the best innings of the tournament by\n[Rediff](/wiki/Rediff \"Rediff\"),[72] and among the top 10 performances in a\nWorld Cup final by the ICC.[73] Tendulkar and Hayden were included among the\n\"Highest impact World XI\", a World Cup team released by the _Wisden_ India\nowned website Impact Index, in February 2015.[74] Srinath, who was then\nIndia's leading wicket-taker in ODIs, retired a few months after the\ncompetition.[75] The match also marked the end of India coach [John\nWright](/wiki/John_Wright_\\(cricketer\\) \"John Wright \\(cricketer\\)\")'s\ncontract.[76] On his request the [Board of Control for Cricket in\nIndia](/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India \"Board of Control for\nCricket in India\") retained his position in which he continued to serve until\n2005.[77][78]\n\n## See\nalso[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cricketball.png/28px-Cricketball.png)[Cricket portal](/wiki/Portal:Cricket \"Portal:Cricket\")\n\n  * [India at the Cricket World Cup](/wiki/India_at_the_Cricket_World_Cup \"India at the Cricket World Cup\")\n  * [List of Cricket World Cup finals](/wiki/List_of_Cricket_World_Cup_finals \"List of Cricket World Cup finals\")\n\n##\nNotes[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=14\n\"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ This figure is according to [ESPNcricinfo](/wiki/ESPNcricinfo \"ESPNcricinfo\").[1] The _[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack](/wiki/Wisden_Cricketers%27_Almanack \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\")_ puts the number at 31,827.[2]\n  2. **Jump up ^** The maximum overs per side was reduced from 60 to 50 overs during the [1987 World Cup](/wiki/1987_Cricket_World_Cup \"1987 Cricket World Cup\").[6]\n  3. **Jump up ^** India's winning streak included eight consecutive victories.[21]\n  4. **Jump up ^** This was Australia's highest total in ODIs at the time.[47]\n  5. **Jump up ^** Ponting's eight sixes in the innings were the most at the time by a batsman in a World Cup match.[1]\n  6. **Jump up ^** As of January 2017, this is the sixth-highest partnership for any wicket for Australia in ODIs.[57]\n  7. **Jump up ^** Tendulkar's aggregate is a record for any player in a single World Cup as of the [2015 tournament](/wiki/2015_Cricket_World_Cup \"2015 Cricket World Cup\").[71]\n\n##\nReferences[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2003_Cricket_World_Cup_Final&action=edit&section=15\n\"Edit section: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ [\"ICC World Cup, Final: Australia v India at Johannesburg, Mar 23, 2003\"](http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65286.html).
