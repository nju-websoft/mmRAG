On 30 January 1969, the band, with\nkeyboardist [Billy Preston](/wiki/Billy_Preston \"Billy Preston\"), surprised a\ncentral London office and fashion district with an impromptu concert from the\nroof of the headquarters of the band's multimedia corporation [Apple\nCorps](/wiki/Apple_Corps \"Apple Corps\") at 3 [Savile Row](/wiki/Savile_Row\n\"Savile Row\"). In a 42-minute set, the Beatles were heard playing nine takes\nof five songs before the [Metropolitan Police\nService](/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Service \"Metropolitan Police Service\")\nasked them to reduce the volume. Footage from the performance was later used\nin the 1970 documentary film _[Let It Be](/wiki/Let_It_Be_\\(film\\) \"Let It Be\n\\(film\\)\")_.\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Set list\n  * 3 Legacy\n  * 4 Personnel\n  * 5 Citations\n  * 6 Sources\n  * 7 External links\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles%27_rooftop_concert&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nAlthough the concert was unannounced, [the Beatles](/wiki/The_Beatles \"The\nBeatles\") had planned on performing live during their _Get Back_ sessions\nearlier in January.[2] It is uncertain who had the idea for a rooftop concert,\nbut the suggestion was conceived just days before the actual event.[3] [George\nHarrison](/wiki/George_Harrison \"George Harrison\") brought in keyboardist\nBilly Preston as an additional musician, in the hope that a talented outside\nobserver would encourage the band to be tight and focused.[3] [Ringo\nStarr](/wiki/Ringo_Starr \"Ringo Starr\") remembered:\n\n> \"There was a plan to play live somewhere. We were wondering where we could\n> go—'Oh, the Palladium or the Sahara'. But we would have had to take all the\n> stuff, so we decided, 'Let's get up on the roof'\".[4]\n\nThe audio was recorded onto two [eight-track\nrecorders](/wiki/Multitrack_recording \"Multitrack recording\") in the basement\nof Apple[5] by engineer [Alan Parsons](/wiki/Alan_Parsons \"Alan Parsons\"),[6]\nand film director [Michael Lindsay-Hogg](/wiki/Michael_Lindsay-Hogg \"Michael\nLindsay-Hogg\")[7] brought in a camera crew to capture several angles of the\nperformance—including reactions from people on the street.[6]\n\nWhen the Beatles first started playing, there was some confusion from\nspectators watching five stories below, many of whom were on their lunch\nbreak. As the news of the event spread, crowds of onlookers began to\ncongregate in the streets and on the roofs of local buildings. While most\nresponded positively to the concert, the [Metropolitan Police\nService](/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Service \"Metropolitan Police Service\") grew\nconcerned about noise and traffic issues.[8] [Apple](/wiki/Apple_Corps_Ltd\n\"Apple Corps Ltd\") employees initially refused to let police inside,\nultimately reconsidering when threatened with arrest.[8]\n\nAs police ascended to the roof, the Beatles realised that the concert would\neventually be shut down, but continued to play for several more minutes.[9]\n[Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\") improvised the lyrics\nof his song \"[Get Back](/wiki/Get_Back \"Get Back\")\" to reflect the situation,\n\"You've been playing on the roofs again, and you know your Momma doesn't like\nit, she's gonna have you arrested!\"[10] The concert came to an end with the\nconclusion of \"Get Back\", with [John Lennon](/wiki/John_Lennon \"John Lennon\")\nsaying, \"I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I\nhope we've passed the audition\".[11]\n\n## Set\nlist[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles%27_rooftop_concert&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Set list\")]\n\nThe rooftop concert consisted of nine takes of five Beatles songs, including:\n\n  * \"[Get Back](/wiki/Get_Back \"Get Back\")\" (three takes)\n  * \"[Don't Let Me Down](/wiki/Don%27t_Let_Me_Down_\\(Beatles_song\\) \"Don't Let Me Down \\(Beatles song\\)\")\" (two takes)\n  * \"[I've Got a Feeling](/wiki/I%27ve_Got_a_Feeling \"I've Got a Feeling\")\" (two takes)\n  * \"[One After 909](/wiki/One_After_909 \"One After 909\")\" (one take)\n  * \"[Dig a Pony](/wiki/Dig_a_Pony \"Dig a Pony\")\" (one take)\n\nThe first performance of \"I've Got a Feeling\", and the recordings of \"One\nAfter 909\", and \"Dig a Pony\" were later used for the album _Let It Be_.[12] In\n1996, a \"rooftop\" version of \"Get Back\", which was the last song of the\nBeatles' final live performance, was included in _[Anthology\n3](/wiki/Anthology_3 \"Anthology 3\")_.[13] An edit of the two takes of \"Don't\nLet Me Down\" was included on _[Let It Be... Naked](/wiki/Let_It_Be..._Naked\n\"Let It Be...

They did\nrecord one more album, _[Abbey Road](/wiki/Abbey_Road \"Abbey Road\")_ , but by\nSeptember 1969 the Beatles had unofficially disbanded.[15] Several of the\nrooftop performances, particularly that of \"Dig a Pony\", showed the Beatles\nonce again in top form, if only temporarily.[16] Fans believed the rooftop\nconcert might have been a try-out for a return to live performances and\ntouring.[17]\n\n[The Rutles](/wiki/The_Rutles \"The Rutles\")' \"Get Up and Go\" sequence in the\nfilm _[All You Need Is Cash](/wiki/All_You_Need_Is_Cash \"All You Need Is\nCash\")_ mimics the footage of the rooftop concert, and uses similar camera\nangles.[18] In January 2009, tribute band [the Bootleg\nBeatles](/wiki/The_Bootleg_Beatles \"The Bootleg Beatles\") attempted to stage a\n40th anniversary concert in the same location, but were refused permission by\n[Westminster City Council](/wiki/Westminster_City_Council \"Westminster City\nCouncil\") due to licensing problems.[19]\n\nIn _[The Simpsons](/wiki/The_Simpsons \"The Simpsons\")_ [fifth\nseason](/wiki/The_Simpsons_\\(season_5\\) \"The Simpsons \\(season 5\\)\") episode\n\"[Homer's Barbershop Quartet](/wiki/Homer%27s_Barbershop_Quartet \"Homer's\nBarbershop Quartet\")\", the Be Sharps ([Homer](/wiki/Homer_Simpson \"Homer\nSimpson\"), [Apu](/wiki/Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon \"Apu Nahasapeemapetilon\"),\n[Barney](/wiki/Barney_Gumble \"Barney Gumble\") and [Principal\nSkinner](/wiki/Seymour_Skinner \"Seymour Skinner\")) perform a rendition of one\nof their previous hits on a rooftop. [George Harrison](/wiki/George_Harrison\n\"George Harrison\"), who guest-starred in the episode, is shown saying\ndismissively \"It's been done!\" As the song ends and the credits begin, Homer\nrepeats John Lennon's phrase about passing the audition and everyone laughs,\nincluding Barney until he says, \"I don't get it.\"[20]\n\nIn the 2007 film _[Across The Universe](/wiki/Across_the_Universe_\\(film\\)\n\"Across the Universe \\(film\\)\")_ , a musical made up entirely of Beatles'\nmusic, Sadie's band performs a rooftop concert in New York City which mimics\nthe original. It is interrupted and closed down by the New York Police\nDepartment.[21]\n\n[U2](/wiki/U2 \"U2\") also referenced the concert in their video for \"[Where the\nStreets Have No Name](/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name \"Where the Streets\nHave No Name\")\", which featured a similar rooftop concert in [Los\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \"Los Angeles\").\n\nMcCartney played a surprise mini-concert in midtown Manhattan on 15 July 2009\nfrom the top of the marquee of the [Ed Sullivan\nTheater](/wiki/Ed_Sullivan_Theater \"Ed Sullivan Theater\"), where he was\nrecording a performance for _[Late Show with David\nLetterman](/wiki/Late_Show_with_David_Letterman \"Late Show with David\nLetterman\")_. News of the event spread via [Twitter](/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\")\nand word of mouth, and nearby street corners were closed off to accommodate\nfans for the set, which duplicated the original Beatles gig.\n\n##\nPersonnel[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles%27_rooftop_concert&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Personnel\")]\n\n  * [John Lennon](/wiki/John_Lennon \"John Lennon\") – vocals, guitar\n  * [Paul McCartney](/wiki/Paul_McCartney \"Paul McCartney\") – vocals, bass guitar\n  * [George Harrison](/wiki/George_Harrison \"George Harrison\") – vocals, guitar\n  * [Ringo Starr](/wiki/Ringo_Starr \"Ringo Starr\") – drums\n  * [Billy Preston](/wiki/Billy_Preston \"Billy Preston\") – electric piano\n\n##\nCitations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=The_Beatles%27_rooftop_concert&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: Citations\")]\n\n  1. **Jump up ^** [\"20 Things You Need To Know About The Beatles' Rooftop Concert\"](http://www.mojo4music.com/11595/20-things-need-know-beatles-rooftop-concert/). _mojo4music.com_. 30 January 2014.
