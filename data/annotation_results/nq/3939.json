1765\nand 1783. The American Patriots in the [Thirteen\nColonies](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies \"Thirteen Colonies\") won independence from\nGreat Britain, becoming the [United States of America](/wiki/United_States\n\"United States\"). They defeated the British in the [American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary War\") in\nalliance with France and others.\n\nMembers of [American colonial\nsociety](/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States \"Colonial history of the\nUnited States\") argued the position of \"[no taxation without\nrepresentation](/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation \"No taxation without\nrepresentation\")\", starting with the [Stamp Act\nCongress](/wiki/Stamp_Act_Congress \"Stamp Act Congress\") in 1765. They\nrejected the authority of [the British\nParliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain \"Parliament of Great Britain\")\nto tax them because they lacked representation in Parliament. Protests\nsteadily escalated to the [burning of the _Gaspee_](/wiki/Gaspee_Affair\n\"Gaspee Affair\") in [Rhode\nIsland](/wiki/Colony_of_Rhode_Island_and_Providence_Plantations \"Colony of\nRhode Island and Providence Plantations\") in 1772, followed by the [Boston Tea\nParty](/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party \"Boston Tea Party\") in 1773, during which\npatriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by\nclosing Boston Harbor, then followed with a [series of legislative\nacts](/wiki/Intolerable_Acts \"Intolerable Acts\") which effectively rescinded\n[Massachusetts Bay Colony](/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony \"Massachusetts Bay\nColony\")'s rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally\nbehind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up [their own alternative\ngovernment](/wiki/First_Continental_Congress \"First Continental Congress\") to\nbetter coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other\ncolonists preferred to remain aligned to the British Crown and were known as\n[_Loyalists_](/wiki/Loyalist_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Loyalist \\(American\nRevolution\\)\") or _Tories_.\n\nTensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when\nthe British attempted to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies at\n[Lexington and Concord](/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord \"Battles of\nLexington and Concord\") in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a\nglobal war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and\nDutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the\n[American Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American\nRevolutionary War\") (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a\n[Provincial Congress](/wiki/Provincial_Congress \"Provincial Congress\") that\nassumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and\nfrom there they built a [Continental Army](/wiki/Continental_Army \"Continental\nArmy\") under the leadership of General [George\nWashington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\"). The Continental\nCongress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the\ncolonists' [rights as Englishmen](/wiki/Rights_of_Englishmen \"Rights of\nEnglishmen\"), and they declared the colonies [free and independent\nstates](/wiki/Lee_Resolution \"Lee Resolution\") on July 2, 1776. The Patriot\nleadership professed the political philosophies of\n[liberalism](/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States \"Liberalism in the United\nStates\") and [republicanism](/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States\n\"Republicanism in the United States\") to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and\nthey proclaimed that all men are created equal.\n\nThe Continental Army forced the British out of Boston in 1776, but the British\ncaptured and held New York City for the duration of the war. The British\nblockaded ports and captured other cities for brief periods, but they failed\nto defeat Washington's forces. The Patriots unsuccessfully attempted to invade\nCanada during the winter of 1775–76, but they captured a British army at the\n[Battle of Saratoga](/wiki/Battle_of_Saratoga \"Battle of Saratoga\") in late\n1777, and the French entered the war as allies of the United States as a\nresult. The war later turned to the American South where the British under the\nleadership of [Charles\nCornwallis](/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis \"Charles\nCornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis\") captured an army at [South\nCarolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\") but failed to enlist enough\nvolunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory.\nA combined American–French force captured a second British army [at\nYorktown](/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown \"Siege of Yorktown\") in 1781, effectively\nending the war in the United States. The [Treaty of\nParis](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\\(1783\\) \"Treaty of Paris \\(1783\\)\") in 1783\nformally ended the conflict, confirming the new nation's complete separation\nfrom the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the\nterritory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the\nBritish retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida.\n\nAmong the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a new\n[Constitution of the United States](/wiki/United_States_Constitution \"United\nStates Constitution\"). The new Constitution established a relatively strong\nfederal national government that included an\n[executive](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States \"President of the United\nStates\"), a [national judiciary](/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court \"United\nStates Supreme Court\"), and a bicameral\n[Congress](/wiki/Congress_of_the_United_States \"Congress of the United\nStates\") that represented states in the [Senate](/wiki/United_States_Senate\n\"United States Senate\") and the population in the [House of\nRepresentatives](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives \"United States\nHouse of Representatives\").[1][2] The Revolution also resulted in the\nmigration of around 60,000 Loyalists to other British territories, especially\nBritish North America (Canada).\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Origin\n    * 1.1 1651–1748: Early seeds\n    * 1.2 1764–1766: Taxes imposed and withdrawn\n    * 1.3 1767–1773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act\n    * 1.4 1774–1775: Intolerable Acts and the Quebec Act\n  * 2 Military hostilities begin\n  * 3 Creating new state constitutions\n  * 4 Independence and Union\n  * 5 Defending the Revolution\n    * 5.1 British return: 1776–1777\n    * 5.2 Prisoners\n    * 5.3 American alliances after 1778\n    * 5.4 The British move South, 1778–1783\n      * 5.4.1 Surrender at Yorktown (1781)\n    * 5.5 The end of the war\n  * 6 Peace treaty\n    * 6.1 Impact on Britain\n  * 7 Finance\n  * 8 Concluding the Revolution\n    * 8.1 Creating a \"more perfect union\" and guaranteeing rights\n    * 8.2 National debt\n  * 9 Ideology and factions\n    * 9.1 Ideology behind the Revolution\n      * 9.1.1 Liberalism\n      * 9.1.2 Republicanism\n        * 9.1.2.1 Fusing republicanism and liberalism\n      * 9.1.3 Impact of Great Awakening\n    * 9.2 Class and psychology of the factions\n    * 9.3 King George III\n    * 9.4 Patriots\n    * 9.5 Loyalists\n    * 9.6 Neutrals\n    * 9.7 Role of women\n  * 10 Other participants\n    * 10.1 France\n    * 10.2 Spain\n    * 10.3 American Indians\n    * 10.4 Black Americans\n  * 11 Effects of the Revolution\n    * 11.1 Loyalist expatriation\n    * 11.2 Interpretations\n    * 11.3 Inspiring all colonies\n    * 11.4 Status of American women\n    * 11.5 Status of African Americans\n    * 11.6 Memory\n  * 12 See also\n  * 13 Notes\n  * 14 References\n  * 15 Bibliography\n    * 15.1 Reference works\n    * 15.2 Surveys of the era\n    * 15.3 Specialized studies\n    * 15.4 Historiography\n    * 15.5 Primary sources\n    * 15.6 Contemporary sources: Annual Register\n  * 16 External links\n\n## Origin\n\nSee also: [Thirteen Colonies](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies \"Thirteen Colonies\")\n\n[![Eastern North America in 1775.

The North American theater of the Seven Years'\nWar, commonly known as the [French and Indian War](/wiki/French_and_Indian_War\n\"French and Indian War\") in the United States, removed France as a major\nplayer in North American affairs and led to the cession of the territory of\n[New France](/wiki/New_France \"New France\") to Great Britain. [Lawrence Henry\nGipson](/wiki/Lawrence_Henry_Gipson \"Lawrence Henry Gipson\"), the historian of\nthe British Empire, states:\n\n    It may be said as truly that the American Revolution was an aftermath of the Anglo-French conflict in the New World carried on between 1754 and 1763.[3]\n\nThe [Royal Proclamation of 1763](/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763 \"Royal\nProclamation of 1763\") may have played a role in the separation of the United\nStates from Great Britain, as colonists at the time wanted to continue in the\neconomically beneficial cultural practice of taking land for one's own\nlivelihood as part of the drive west. The lands west of Quebec and west of a\nline running along the crest of the [Allegheny\nmountains](/wiki/Allegheny_Mountains \"Allegheny Mountains\") became Indian\nterritory, temporarily barred to settlement.\n\n### 1651–1748: Early seeds\n\nMain articles: [Navigation Acts](/wiki/Navigation_Acts \"Navigation Acts\"),\n[Dominion of New England](/wiki/Dominion_of_New_England \"Dominion of New\nEngland\"), [King Philip's War](/wiki/King_Philip%27s_War \"King Philip's War\"),\nand [War of the Austrian Succession](/wiki/War_of_the_Austrian_Succession \"War\nof the Austrian Succession\")\n\nAs early as 1651, the [English government](/wiki/Parliament_of_England\n\"Parliament of England\") had sought to regulate trade in the [American\ncolonies](/wiki/British_America \"British America\"). On October 9, the\n[Navigation Acts](/wiki/Navigation_Acts#Navigation_Act_1651 \"Navigation Acts\")\nwere passed to ensure that trade [enriched only Britain](/wiki/Mercantilism\n\"Mercantilism\"), barring trade with other nations.[4][5] Some argue that the\neconomic impact was minimal on the colonists,[6][7] but the political friction\nwhich the acts triggered was more serious, as the merchants most directly\naffected were most politically active.[8] [King Philip's\nWar](/wiki/King_Philip%27s_War \"King Philip's War\") ended in 1678, and much of\nit was fought without significant assistance from England. This contributed to\nthe development of a unique identity, separate from that of\n[Britain](/wiki/Britishness \"Britishness\").[9]\n\nIn the 1680s, [King Charles II](/wiki/Charles_II_of_England \"Charles II of\nEngland\") determined to bring the [New England\ncolonies](/wiki/New_England_colonies \"New England colonies\") under a more\ncentralized administration in order to regulate trade more effectively.[10]\nHis efforts were fiercely opposed by the colonists, resulting in the\nabrogation of their colonial charter by the Crown.[11] Charles' successor\n[James II](/wiki/James_II_of_England \"James II of England\") finalized these\nefforts in 1686, establishing the [Dominion of New\nEngland](/wiki/Dominion_of_New_England \"Dominion of New England\"). Dominion\nrule triggered bitter resentment throughout New England; the enforcement of\nthe unpopular Navigation Acts and the curtailing of local democracy angered\nthe colonists.[12] New Englanders were encouraged, however, by a [change of\ngovernment in England](/wiki/Glorious_Revolution \"Glorious Revolution\") that\nsaw James II effectively [abdicate](/wiki/Abdicate \"Abdicate\"), and a\n[populist uprising](/wiki/1689_Boston_revolt \"1689 Boston revolt\") overthrew\nDominion rule on April 18, 1689.[13][14] Colonial governments reasserted their\ncontrol in the wake of the revolt, and successive governments made no more\nattempts to restore the Dominion.[15][16]\n\nSubsequent English governments continued in their efforts to tax certain\ngoods, passing acts regulating the trade of [wool](/wiki/Wool_Act_1699 \"Wool\nAct 1699\"),[17] [hats](/wiki/Hat_Act \"Hat Act\"),[18] and\n[molasses](/wiki/Molasses_Act \"Molasses Act\").[19] The Molasses Act of 1733 in\nparticular was egregious to the colonists, as a significant part of colonial\ntrade relied on the product. The taxes severely damaged the New England\neconomy, and the taxes were rarely paid as a result, resulting in a surge of\nsmuggling, bribery, and intimidation of customs officials.[20] Colonial wars\nfought in America were often the source of considerable tension.

That same year, Prime Minister [George\nGrenville](/wiki/George_Grenville \"George Grenville\") proposed direct taxes on\nthe colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to see whether the\ncolonies would propose some way to raise the revenue themselves.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\nParliament finally passed the Stamp Act in March 1765 which imposed direct\ntaxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers,\nalmanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps—even decks of playing\ncards.\n\nThe colonists did not object that the taxes were high; they were actually\nlow.[23] They objected to the fact that they had no representation in the\nParliament, and thus no voice concerning legislation that affected them.\n[Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\") testified in\nParliament in 1766 that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense\nof the Empire. He said that local governments had raised, outfitted, and paid\n25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many\nmillions from American treasuries doing so in the [French and Indian\nWar](/wiki/French_and_Indian_War \"French and Indian War\") alone.[24][25]\nLondon had to deal with 1,500 politically well-connected British Army\nsoldiers. The decision was to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they\nhad to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a [standing\narmy](/wiki/Standing_army \"Standing army\") in Great Britain during peacetime\nwas politically unacceptable, so the decision was made to station them in\nAmerica and have the Americans pay them. The soldiers had no military mission;\nthey were not there to defend the colonies because there was no threat to the\ncolonies.[26]\n\nThe [Sons of Liberty](/wiki/Sons_of_Liberty \"Sons of Liberty\") were formed in\n1765. They used public demonstrations, [boycott](/wiki/Boycott \"Boycott\"),\nviolence, and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were\nunenforceable. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the [vice\nadmiralty court](/wiki/Vice_admiralty_court \"Vice admiralty court\") and looted\nthe home of chief justice [Thomas\nHutchinson](/wiki/Thomas_Hutchinson_\\(governor\\) \"Thomas Hutchinson\n\\(governor\\)\"). Several legislatures called for united action, and nine\ncolonies sent delegates to the [Stamp Act Congress](/wiki/Stamp_Act_Congress\n\"Stamp Act Congress\") in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\")\nin October 1765. Moderates led by [John\nDickinson](/wiki/John_Dickinson_\\(delegate\\) \"John Dickinson \\(delegate\\)\")\ndrew up a \"[Declaration of Rights and\nGrievances](/wiki/Declaration_of_Rights_and_Grievances \"Declaration of Rights\nand Grievances\")\" stating that taxes passed without representation violated\ntheir [rights as Englishmen](/wiki/Rights_of_Englishmen \"Rights of\nEnglishmen\"). Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports\nof British merchandise.[27]\n\nThe Parliament at Westminster saw itself as the supreme lawmaking authority\nthroughout all British possessions and thus entitled to levy any tax without\ncolonial approval.[28] They argued that the colonies were legally British\ncorporations that were completely subordinate to the British parliament and\npointed to numerous instances where Parliament had made laws binding on the\ncolonies in the past.[29] They did not see anything in the unwritten British\nconstitution that made taxes special[30] and noted that they had taxed\nAmerican trade for decades. Parliament insisted that the colonies effectively\nenjoyed a \"[virtual representation](/wiki/Virtual_representation \"Virtual\nrepresentation\")\" as most British people did, as only a small minority of the\nBritish population elected representatives to Parliament.[31] Americans such\nas [James Otis](/wiki/James_Otis,_Jr. \"James Otis, Jr.\") maintained that the\nAmericans were not in fact virtually represented.[32]\n\nIn London, the [Rockingham](/wiki/Charles_Watson-\nWentworth,_2nd_Marquess_of_Rockingham \"Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess\nof Rockingham\") government came to power (July 1765) and Parliament debated\nwhether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it. Benjamin\nFranklin made the case for repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent\nheavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of\nwars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those\nwars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and\nrepealed the tax (February 21, 1766), but insisted in the [Declaratory\nAct](/wiki/Declaratory_Act \"Declaratory Act\") of March 1766 that they retained\nfull power to make laws for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\".[33] The\nrepeal nonetheless caused widespread celebrations in the colonies.\n\n### 1767–1773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act\n\nMain articles: [Townshend Acts](/wiki/Townshend_Acts \"Townshend Acts\") and\n[Tea Act](/wiki/Tea_Act \"Tea Act\")\n\nFurther information: [Massachusetts Circular\nLetter](/wiki/Massachusetts_Circular_Letter \"Massachusetts Circular Letter\"),\n[Boston Massacre](/wiki/Boston_Massacre \"Boston Massacre\"), and [Boston Tea\nParty](/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party \"Boston Tea Party\")\n\n[![Burning of the\nGaspee](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Gaspee_Affair.jpg/220px-\nGaspee_Affair.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gaspee_Affair.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Gaspee_Affair.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nBurning of the _[Gaspee](/wiki/Gaspee_Affair \"Gaspee Affair\")_\n\nIn 1767, the Parliament passed the [Townshend Acts](/wiki/Townshend_Acts\n\"Townshend Acts\") which placed duties on a number of essential goods,\nincluding paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston\nto more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on\nthe belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external\ntaxes such as custom duties. The Americans, however, argued against the\nconstitutionality of the act because its purpose was to raise revenue and not\nregulate trade. Colonists responded by organizing new boycotts of British\ngoods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the Townshend goods\nwere widely used.\n\nIn February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay [issued a circular\nletter](/wiki/Massachusetts_Circular_Letter \"Massachusetts Circular Letter\")\nto the other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance. The governor\ndissolved the assembly when it refused to rescind the letter. Meanwhile, a\nriot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop _Liberty_\n, owned by [John Hancock](/wiki/John_Hancock \"John Hancock\"), for alleged\nsmuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to\ndeploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was\ndue to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A\nconvention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself.\nIn January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the\n[Treason Act 1543](/wiki/Treason_Act_1543 \"Treason Act 1543\") which called for\nsubjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England. The governor\nof Massachusetts was instructed to collect evidence of said treason, and the\nthreat caused widespread outrage, though it was not carried out.\n\nOn March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around a group of British soldiers.\nThe crowd grew threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One\nsoldier was clubbed and fell.[34] There was no order to fire, but the soldiers\nfired into the crowd anyway. They hit 11 people; three civilians died at the\nscene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came\nto be called the [Boston Massacre](/wiki/Boston_Massacre \"Boston Massacre\").\nThe soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by [John\nAdams](/wiki/John_Adams \"John Adams\")), but the widespread descriptions soon\nbegan to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This, in turn, began a\ndownward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of\nMassachusetts.[34]\n\nA new ministry under [Lord North](/wiki/Lord_North \"Lord North\") came to power\nin 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up\nits efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the right to tax. This\ntemporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely\nceased, with only the more radical patriots such as [Samuel\nAdams](/wiki/Samuel_Adams \"Samuel Adams\") continuing to agitate.\n\n[![Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance.

The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no\naction was taken.\n\nIn 1772, it became known that the Crown intended to pay fixed salaries to the\ngovernors and judges in Massachusetts. Samuel Adams in Boston set about\ncreating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13\ncolonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government.\nVirginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence in early\n1773, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.[36]\n\nA total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on \"Committees of\nCorrespondence\" at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the\nleadership in their communities. Loyalists were excluded. The committees\nbecame the [leaders](/wiki/Leadership \"Leadership\") of the American resistance\nto British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and\nlocal level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British\nproducts, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant\nrecords and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the\nboycott by importing British goods.[37]\n\nIn 1773, [private letters were published](/wiki/Hutchinson_Letters_Affair\n\"Hutchinson Letters Affair\") in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson\nclaimed that the colonists could not enjoy all English liberties, and\nLieutenant Governor [Andrew Oliver](/wiki/Andrew_Oliver \"Andrew Oliver\")\ncalled for the direct payment of colonial officials. The letters' contents\nwere used as evidence of a systematic plot against American rights, and\ndiscredited Hutchinson in the eyes of the people; the Assembly petitioned for\nhis recall. [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin Franklin\"),\npostmaster general for the colonies, acknowledged that he leaked the letters,\nwhich led to him being berated by British officials and fired from his job.\n\nMeanwhile, Parliament passed the [Tea Act](/wiki/Tea_Act \"Tea Act\") to lower\nthe price of taxed tea exported to the colonies in order to help the [East\nIndia Company](/wiki/East_India_Company \"East India Company\") undersell\nsmuggled Dutch tea. Special consignees were appointed to sell the tea in order\nto bypass colonial merchants. The act was opposed by those who resisted the\ntaxes and also by smugglers who stood to lose business.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In most\ninstances, the consignees were forced to resign and the tea was turned back,\nbut Massachusetts governor Hutchinson refused to allow Boston merchants to\ngive in to pressure. A town meeting in Boston determined that the tea would\nnot be landed, and ignored a demand from the governor to disperse. On December\n16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke the\nappearance of American Indians, boarded the ships of the [British East India\nCompany](/wiki/East_India_Company \"East India Company\") and dumped £10,000\nworth of tea from their holds (approximately £636,000 in 2008) into Boston\nHarbor.

They consisted of\nfour laws enacted by the British parliament.[39] The first was the\n[Massachusetts Government Act](/wiki/Massachusetts_Government_Act\n\"Massachusetts Government Act\") which altered the Massachusetts charter and\nrestricted town meetings. The second act was the [Administration of Justice\nAct](/wiki/Administration_of_Justice_Act_1774 \"Administration of Justice Act\n1774\") which ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be\narraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the [Boston Port\nAct](/wiki/Boston_Port_Act \"Boston Port Act\"), which closed the port of Boston\nuntil the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea\nParty. The fourth Act was the [Quartering Act of 1774](/wiki/Quartering_Acts\n\"Quartering Acts\"), which allowed royal governors to house British troops in\nthe homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner.[40]\n\nIn response, Massachusetts patriots issued the [Suffolk\nResolves](/wiki/Suffolk_Resolves \"Suffolk Resolves\") and formed an alternative\nshadow government known as the \"Provincial Congress\" which began training\nmilitia outside British-occupied Boston.[41] In September 1774, the [First\nContinental Congress](/wiki/First_Continental_Congress \"First Continental\nCongress\") convened, consisting of representatives from each of the colonies,\nto serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. During secret\ndebates, conservative [Joseph Galloway](/wiki/Joseph_Galloway \"Joseph\nGalloway\") proposed the creation of a colonial Parliament that would be able\nto approve or disapprove of acts of the British Parliament, but his idea was\nnot accepted. The Congress instead endorsed the proposal of John Adams that\nAmericans would obey Parliament voluntarily but would resist all taxes in\ndisguise. Congress called for a boycott beginning on 1 December 1774 of all\nBritish goods; it was enforced by new committees authorized by the\nCongress.[42]\n\n## Military hostilities begin\n\n[![\"Join, or Die\" by Benjamin Franklin was recycled to encourage the former\ncolonies to unite against British\nrule](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Benjamin_Franklin_-\n_Join_or_Die.jpg/250px-Benjamin_Franklin_-\n_Join_or_Die.jpg)](/wiki/File:Benjamin_Franklin_-_Join_or_Die.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Benjamin_Franklin_-_Join_or_Die.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Join, or Die](/wiki/Join,_or_Die \"Join, or Die\") by Benjamin Franklin was\nrecycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule.\n\nFurther information: [Shot heard 'round the\nworld](/wiki/Shot_heard_%27round_the_world \"Shot heard 'round the world\"),\n[Boston campaign](/wiki/Boston_campaign \"Boston campaign\"), [Invasion of\nCanada (1775)](/wiki/Invasion_of_Canada_\\(1775\\) \"Invasion of Canada\n\\(1775\\)\"), and [American Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War\n\"American Revolutionary War\")\n\nMassachusetts was declared in a state of rebellion in February 1775 and the\nBritish garrison received orders to disarm the rebels and arrest their\nleaders, leading to the [Battles of Lexington and\nConcord](/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord \"Battles of Lexington and\nConcord\") on 19 April 1775. The Patriots laid siege to Boston, expelled royal\nofficials from all the colonies, and took control through the establishment of\n[Provincial Congresses](/wiki/Provincial_Congress \"Provincial Congress\"). The\n[Battle of Bunker Hill](/wiki/Battle_of_Bunker_Hill \"Battle of Bunker Hill\")\nfollowed on June 17, 1775. It was a British victory—but at a great cost: about\n1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500\nAmerican casualties from a much larger force.[43][44] The Second Continental\nCongress was divided on the best course of action, but eventually produced the\n[Olive Branch Petition](/wiki/Olive_Branch_Petition \"Olive Branch Petition\"),\nin which they attempted to come to an accord with [King\nGeorge](/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom \"George III of the United\nKingdom\").

There still were many Loyalists, but they were no\nlonger in control anywhere by July 1776, and all of the Royal officials had\nfled.[45]\n\n## Creating new state constitutions\n\nFollowing the [Battle of Bunker Hill](/wiki/Battle_of_Bunker_Hill \"Battle of\nBunker Hill\") in June 1775, the Patriots had control of Massachusetts outside\nthe Boston city limits, and the Loyalists suddenly found themselves on the\ndefensive with no protection from the British army. In all 13 colonies,\nPatriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving\naway British officials. They had elected conventions and \"legislatures\" that\nexisted outside any legal framework; new constitutions were drawn up in each\nstate to supersede royal charters. They declared that they were states now,\nnot colonies.[46]\n\nOn January 5, 1776, [New Hampshire](/wiki/Province_of_New_Hampshire \"Province\nof New Hampshire\") ratified the first state constitution. In May 1776,\nCongress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by\nlocally created authority. Virginia, [South\nCarolina](/wiki/Province_of_South_Carolina \"Province of South Carolina\"), and\nNew Jersey created their constitutions before July 4. [Rhode\nIsland](/wiki/Colony_of_Rhode_Island_and_Providence_Plantations \"Colony of\nRhode Island and Providence Plantations\") and\n[Connecticut](/wiki/Connecticut_Colony \"Connecticut Colony\") simply took their\nexisting [royal charters](/wiki/Royal_charter \"Royal charter\") and deleted all\nreferences to the crown.[47] The new states were all committed to\nrepublicanism, with no inherited offices. They decided what form of government\nto create, and also how to select those who would craft the constitutions and\nhow the resulting document would be ratified. On 26 May 1776, [John\nAdams](/wiki/John_Adams \"John Adams\") wrote James Sullivan from Philadelphia:\n\n\"Depend upon it, sir, it is dangerous to open so fruitful a source of\ncontroversy and altercation, as would be opened by attempting to alter the\nqualifications of voters.

In\n1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new\nconstitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution\nsubstantially reduced universal male suffrage, gave the governor veto power\nand patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial\nwealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature.

[Richard Henry\nLee](/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee \"Richard Henry Lee\") was instructed by the\nVirginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776.\nOn the 11th, a committee was created to draft a document explaining the\njustifications for separation from Britain. After securing enough votes for\npassage, independence was voted for on July 2. The [Declaration of\nIndependence](/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence \"United States\nDeclaration of Independence\") was drafted largely by [Thomas\nJefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") and presented by the\ncommittee; it unanimously adopted by the entire Congress on July 4.[52]\nHistorian George Billias says:\n\n    Independence amounted to a new status of interdependence: the United States was now a sovereign nation entitled to the privileges and responsibilities that came with that status. America thus became a member of the international community, which meant becoming a maker of treaties and alliances, a military ally in diplomacy, and a partner in foreign trade on a more equal basis.[53]\n\nThe Second Continental Congress approved a new constitution, the \"Articles of\nConfederation,\" for ratification by the states on November 15, 1777, and\nimmediately began operating under their terms. The Articles were formally\nratified on March 1, 1781. At that point, the Continental Congress was\ndissolved and a new government of the [United States in Congress\nAssembled](/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation \"Congress of the\nConfederation\") took its place on the following day, with [Samuel\nHuntington](/wiki/Samuel_Huntington_\\(statesman\\) \"Samuel Huntington\n\\(statesman\\)\") as presiding officer.[54][55]\n\n## Defending the Revolution\n\nMain article: [American Revolutionary War](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War\n\"American Revolutionary War\")\n\n### British return: 1776–1777\n\nFurther information: [New York and New Jersey\ncampaign](/wiki/New_York_and_New_Jersey_campaign \"New York and New Jersey\ncampaign\"), [Staten Island Peace\nConference](/wiki/Staten_Island_Peace_Conference \"Staten Island Peace\nConference\"), [Saratoga campaign](/wiki/Saratoga_campaign \"Saratoga\ncampaign\"), and [Philadelphia campaign](/wiki/Philadelphia_campaign\n\"Philadelphia campaign\")\n\nAccording to British historian [Jeremy Black](/wiki/Jeremy_Black_\\(historian\\)\n\"Jeremy Black \\(historian\\)\"), the British had significant advantages,\nincluding a highly trained army, the world's largest navy, and a highly\nefficient system of public finance that could easily fund the war. However,\nthe British were seriously handicapped by their misunderstanding of the depth\nof support for the Patriot position. Ignoring the advice of General Gage, they\nmisinterpreted the situation as merely a large-scale riot. London decided that\nthey could overawe the Americans by sending a large military and naval force,\nforcing them to be loyal again:\n\n> Convinced that the Revolution was the work of a full few miscreants who had\n> rallied an armed rabble to their cause, they expected that the\n> revolutionaries would be intimidated…. Then the vast majority of Americans,\n> who were loyal but cowed by the terroristic tactics… would rise up, kick out\n> the rebels, and restore loyal government in each colony.[56]\n\nWashington forced the British out of Boston in the spring of 1776, and neither\nthe British nor the Loyalists controlled any significant areas. The British,\nhowever, were massing forces at their naval base at [Halifax, Nova\nScotia](/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality \"Halifax Regional Municipality\").\nThey returned in force in July 1776, landing in New York and defeating\nWashington's Continental Army in August at the [Battle of\nBrooklyn](/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Island \"Battle of Long Island\"). Following that\nvictory, the British requested a meeting with representatives from Congress to\nnegotiate an end to hostilities.[57][58]\n\nA delegation including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin met\n[Howe](/wiki/Richard_Howe,_1st_Earl_Howe \"Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe\") on\n[Staten Island](/wiki/Staten_Island \"Staten Island\") in New York Harbor on\nSeptember 11, in what became known as the [Staten Island Peace\nConference](/wiki/Staten_Island_Peace_Conference \"Staten Island Peace\nConference\"). Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence,\nwhich was refused, and negotiations ended. The British then [quickly seized\nNew York City](/wiki/Battle_of_Kip%27s_Bay \"Battle of Kip's Bay\") and nearly\ncaptured Washington's army. They made New York their main political and\nmilitary base of operations in North America, [holding it until November\n1783](/wiki/Evacuation_Day_\\(New_York\\) \"Evacuation Day \\(New York\\)\"). The\ncity became the destination for Loyalist refugees and a focal point of\nWashington's [intelligence\nnetwork](/wiki/Intelligence_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Intelligence in\nthe American Revolutionary War\").[57][58]\n\nThe British also took New Jersey, pushing the Continental Army into\nPennsylvania. Washington [crossed the Delaware\nRiver](/wiki/Washington%27s_crossing_of_the_Delaware \"Washington's crossing of\nthe Delaware\") back into New Jersey in a surprise attack in late December 1776\nand defeated Hessian and British armies at [Trenton](/wiki/Battle_of_Trenton\n\"Battle of Trenton\") and [Princeton](/wiki/Battle_of_Princeton \"Battle of\nPrinceton\"), thereby regaining control of most of New Jersey. The victories\ngave an important boost to Patriots at a time when morale was flagging, and\nhave become iconic events of the war.\n\nIn 1777, the British sent Burgoyne's invasion force from Canada south to New\nYork to seal off New England. Their aim was to neutralize the Yankees, whom\nthe British perceived as the primary source of agitators. The British army in\nNew York City went to Philadelphia in a major case of mis-coordination,\ncapturing it from Washington. The invasion army under\n[Burgoyne](/wiki/John_Burgoyne \"John Burgoyne\") was much too slow and became\ntrapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the [Battles of\nSaratoga](/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga \"Battles of Saratoga\") in October 1777.\nFrom early October 1777 until November 15, a siege distracted British troops\nat [Fort Mifflin](/wiki/Fort_Mifflin \"Fort Mifflin\"), Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by\nsafely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at [Valley\nForge](/wiki/Valley_Forge \"Valley Forge\").\n\n### Prisoners\n\nMain article: [Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/Prisoners_of_war_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Prisoners of\nwar in the American Revolutionary War\")\n\nIn August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority\nto be traitors to the Crown. Following their surrender at the [Battles of\nSaratoga](/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga \"Battles of Saratoga\") in October 1777,\nthere were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands.\nAlthough Lord Germain took a hard line, the British generals on the scene\nnever held treason trials; they treated captured enemy soldiers as [prisoners\nof war](/wiki/Prisoners_of_war \"Prisoners of war\").[59] The dilemma was that\ntens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American\nretaliation would have been easy. The British built much of their strategy\naround using these Loyalists,[60] and therefore, no Americans were put on\ntrial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners whom they held,\nresulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than from combat\noperations.[60] At the end of the war, both sides released their surviving\nprisoners.[61]\n\n### American alliances after 1778\n\nFurther information: [France in the American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/France_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"France in the American\nRevolutionary War\") and [Spain in the American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/Spain_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Spain in the American\nRevolutionary War\")\n\nThe capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally\nenter the war in support of Congress. Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent\nmilitary alliance in early 1778, significantly becoming the first country to\nofficially recognize the Declaration of Independence. On February 6, 1778, a\n[Treaty of Amity and\nCommerce](/wiki/Treaty_of_Amity_and_Commerce_\\(USA%E2%80%93France\\) \"Treaty of\nAmity and Commerce \\(USA–France\\)\") and a [Treaty of\nAlliance](/wiki/Treaty_of_Alliance_\\(1778\\) \"Treaty of Alliance \\(1778\\)\")\nwere signed between the United States and France.[62] [William\nPitt](/wiki/William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham \"William Pitt, 1st Earl of\nChatham\") spoke out in parliament urging Britain to make peace in America and\nto unite with America against France, while other British politicians who had\npreviously sympathized with colonial grievances now turned against the\nAmericans for allying with Britain's international rival and enemy.[63]\n\nLater, Spain (in 1779) and the [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_Republic \"Dutch Republic\")\n(1780) became allies of the French, leaving the British Empire to fight a\nglobal war alone without major allies, and requiring it to slip through a\ncombined blockade of the Atlantic. The American theater thus became only one\nfront in Britain's war.[64] The British were forced to withdraw troops from\ncontinental America to reinforce the valuable sugar-producing Caribbean\ncolonies, which were more lucrative to British investors.\n\nBritish commander [Sir Henry\nClinton](/wiki/Henry_Clinton_\\(American_War_of_Independence\\) \"Henry Clinton\n\\(American War of Independence\\)\") evacuated Philadelphia and returned to New\nYork City. General Washington intercepted Clinton in the [Battle of Monmouth\nCourt House](/wiki/Battle_of_Monmouth \"Battle of Monmouth\"), the last major\nbattle fought in the north. After an inconclusive engagement, the British\nsuccessfully retreated to New York City. The northern war subsequently became\na stalemate, as the focus of attention shifted to the smaller southern\ntheater.[65]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Us_unabhaengigkeitskrieg.jpg/250px-\nUs_unabhaengigkeitskrieg.jpg)](/wiki/File:Us_unabhaengigkeitskrieg.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Us_unabhaengigkeitskrieg.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Hessian](/wiki/Hessian_\\(soldiers\\) \"Hessian \\(soldiers\\)\") troops hired out\nto the British by their German sovereigns\n\n### The British move South, 1778–1783\n\nFurther information: [Southern theater of the American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/Southern_theater_of_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Southern\ntheater of the American Revolutionary War\") and [Naval operations in the\nAmerican Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/Naval_operations_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Naval\noperations in the American Revolutionary War\")\n\nThe British strategy in America now concentrated on a campaign in the southern\nstates. With fewer regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders\nsaw the \"southern strategy\" as a more viable plan, as the south was perceived\nas being more strongly Loyalist, with a large population of recent immigrants\nas well as large numbers of slaves who might be captured or run away to join\nthe British.[66]\n\nBeginning in late December 1778, the British captured\n[Savannah](/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia \"Savannah, Georgia\") and controlled the\n[Georgia](/wiki/Province_of_Georgia \"Province of Georgia\") coastline. In 1780,\nthey launched a fresh invasion and [took Charleston](/wiki/Siege_of_Charleston\n\"Siege of Charleston\"), as well. A significant victory at the [Battle of\nCamden](/wiki/Battle_of_Camden \"Battle of Camden\") meant that royal forces\nsoon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina. The British set up a\nnetwork of forts inland, hoping that the Loyalists would rally to the\nflag.[67]\n\nNot enough Loyalists turned out, however, and the British had to fight their\nway north into North Carolina and Virginia, with a severely weakened army.\nBehind them, much of the territory that they had already captured dissolved\ninto a chaotic [guerrilla war](/wiki/Guerrilla_war \"Guerrilla war\"), fought\npredominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia, which negated\nmany of the gains that the British had previously made.[67]\n\n#### Surrender at Yorktown (1781)\n\nMain article: [Siege of Yorktown](/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown \"Siege of Yorktown\")\n\n[![The Siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army,\npaving the way for the end of the American Revolutionary\nWar](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Yorktown80.JPG/250px-\nYorktown80.JPG)](/wiki/File:Yorktown80.JPG)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Yorktown80.JPG \"Enlarge\")\n\nThe [siege of Yorktown](/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown \"Siege of Yorktown\") ended\nwith the surrender of a second British army, marking effective British defeat.\n\nThe British army under Cornwallis marched to [Yorktown,\nVirginia](/wiki/Yorktown,_Virginia \"Yorktown, Virginia\") where they expected\nto be rescued by a British fleet.[68] The fleet showed up, but so did a larger\nFrench fleet, so the British fleet returned to New York for reinforcements\nafter the [Battle of the Chesapeake](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Chesapeake \"Battle of\nthe Chesapeake\"), leaving Cornwallis trapped. In October 1781, the British\nsurrendered their second invading army of the war, under a siege by the\ncombined French and Continental armies commanded by Washington.[69]\n\n### The end of the war\n\nHistorians continue to debate whether the odds for American victory were long\nor short. [John E. Ferling](/wiki/John_E._Ferling \"John E. Ferling\") says that\nthe odds were so long that the American victory was \"almost a miracle\".[70] On\nthe other hand, [Joseph Ellis](/wiki/Joseph_Ellis \"Joseph Ellis\") says that\nthe odds favored the Americans, and asks whether there ever was any realistic\nchance for the British to win. He argues that this opportunity came only once,\nin the summer of 1776, and the British failed that test. Admiral Howe and his\nbrother General Howe \"missed several opportunities to destroy the Continental\nArmy.... Chance, luck, and even the vagaries of the weather played crucial\nroles.\" Ellis's point is that the strategic and tactical decisions of the\nHowes were fatally flawed because they underestimated the challenges posed by\nthe Patriots. Ellis concludes that, once the Howe brothers failed, the\nopportunity for a British victory \"would never come again.\"[71]\n\nSupport for the conflict had never been strong in Britain, where many\nsympathized with the Americans, but now it reached a new low.[72] King George\nIII personally wanted to fight on, but his supporters lost control of\nParliament and no further major land offensives were launched in the American\nTheater.[65][73]\n\nWashington could not know that the British would not reopen hostilities after\nYorktown. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston,\nand Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy\ndeparted, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83.[74] The treasury was\nempty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of\nmutiny or possible _coup d 'état_. The unrest among officers of the [Newburgh\nConspiracy](/wiki/Newburgh_Conspiracy \"Newburgh Conspiracy\") was personally\ndispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise\nof a five years bonus for all officers.[75]\n\n## Peace treaty\n\nMain article: [Treaty of Paris (1783)](/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_\\(1783\\) \"Treaty\nof Paris \\(1783\\)\")\n\nDuring negotiations in Paris, the American delegation discovered that France\nwould support independence, but no territorial gains. The new nation would be\nconfined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. The American\ndelegation opened direct secret negotiations with London, cutting the French\nout. British Prime Minister [Lord\nShelburne](/wiki/William_Petty,_2nd_Earl_of_Shelburne \"William Petty, 2nd Earl\nof Shelburne\") was in full charge of the British negotiations. He now saw a\nchance to make the United States a valuable economic partner.[76] The US\nobtained all the land east of the Mississippi River, south of Canada, and\nnorth of Florida. It gained fishing rights off Canadian coasts, and agreed to\nallow British merchants and Loyalists to try to recover their property. It was\na highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the\nBritish point of view. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-\nway trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, as indeed\ncame to pass. Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions\nwere gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in\nthe world, and their businesses flourished.[77]\n\nThe British largely abandoned the Indian allies living in the new nation. They\nwere not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were\ndefeated militarily by the United States. However, the British did promise to\nsupport the Indians. They sold them munitions and maintained forts in American\nterritory until the [Jay Treaty](/wiki/Jay_Treaty \"Jay Treaty\") of 1795.[78]\n\n### Impact on Britain\n\nLosing the war and the 13 colonies was a shock to Britain. The war revealed\nthe limitations of Britain's [fiscal-military state](/wiki/Fiscal-\nmilitary_state \"Fiscal-military state\") when they discovered that they\nsuddenly faced powerful enemies with no allies, and they were dependent on\nextended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat\nheightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's\nministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an\nover-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and\ngovernment retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as\nwidespread institutional corruption.[79][80]\n\nThe result was a powerful crisis from 1776 to 1783. The peace in 1783 left\nFrance financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed thanks to the\nreturn of American business. The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King's\nshrewdness in outwitting [Charles James Fox](/wiki/Charles_James_Fox \"Charles\nJames Fox\") (the leader of the [Fox-North Coalition](/wiki/Fox-North_Coalition\n\"Fox-North Coalition\")), and renewed confidence in the system engendered by\nthe leadership of the new Prime Minister [William\nPitt](/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger \"William Pitt the Younger\"). Historians\nconclude that loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the\n[French Revolution](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French Revolution\") with more\nunity and better organization than would otherwise have been the case.[79][80]\nBritain turned towards Asia, the Pacific and later Africa with subsequent\nexploration leading to the rise of the [Second British\nEmpire](/wiki/Second_British_Empire \"Second British Empire\").[81]\n\n## Finance\n\nBritain's war against the Americans, French, and Spanish cost about £100\nmillion. The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money that it needed.[82] Heavy\nspending brought France to the [verge of bankruptcy and\nrevolution](/wiki/Causes_of_the_French_Revolution#Economics_and_finances\n\"Causes of the French Revolution\"), while the British had relatively little\ndifficulty financing their war, keeping their suppliers and soldiers paid, and\nhiring tens of thousands of German soldiers.[83]\n\nBritain had a sophisticated financial system based on the wealth of thousands\nof landowners, who supported the government, together with banks and\nfinanciers in London. The British tax system collected about 12 percent of the\nGDP in taxes during the 1770s.[83]\n\nIn sharp contrast, Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty\nfinancing the war.[84] In 1775, there was at most 12 million dollars in gold\nin the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone\nfinance a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a\ntight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and\nexports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen\nand donations from patriotic citizens.[85][86] Another was to delay actual\npayments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise that\nit would be made good after the war. Indeed, the soldiers and officers were\ngiven land grants in 1783 to cover the wages that they had earned but had not\nbeen paid during the war. Not until 1781 did the national government have a\nstrong leader in financial matters, when [Robert\nMorris](/wiki/Robert_Morris_\\(financier\\) \"Robert Morris \\(financier\\)\") was\nnamed [Superintendent of Finance of the United\nStates](/wiki/Superintendent_of_Finance_of_the_United_States \"Superintendent\nof Finance of the United States\").[85]\n\nMorris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private [Bank of North\nAmerica](/wiki/Bank_of_North_America \"Bank of North America\") to finance the\nwar. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by\nusing competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and\ndemanded the national government's full share of money and supplies from the\nconfederated states.[85]\n\nCongress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about\n66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).[87] Congress made two issues\nof paper money—in 1775–1780 and in 1780–81. The first issue amounted to 242\nmillion dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state\ntaxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one\ncent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was \"not worth a Continental\", as\npeople said.[88]\n\nThe skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed\nincomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly\naffected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with\ndepreciated paper. The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the\nContinental Army, whose wages were usually in arrears and declined in value\nevery month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships of their\nfamilies.[89]\n\nBeginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But\nthe states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780,\nCongress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork,\nand other necessities—an inefficient system that kept the army barely\nalive.[90][91]\n\nStarting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy\nindividuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in\nfact redeemed in 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money\nbecause Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were\nsupporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the\nAmericans with money, gunpowder, and munitions in order to weaken its arch\nenemy Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the\nsubsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris\nand Amsterdam, lent large sums to the American war effort. These loans were\nrepaid in full in the 1790s.[92]\n\n## Concluding the Revolution\n\nMain articles: [Philadelphia Convention](/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention\n\"Philadelphia Convention\") and [United States Bill of\nRights](/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights \"United States Bill of Rights\")\n\nSee also: [Annapolis Convention (1786)](/wiki/Annapolis_Convention_\\(1786\\)\n\"Annapolis Convention \\(1786\\)\") and [The Federalist\nPapers](/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers \"The Federalist Papers\")\n\n### Creating a \"more perfect union\" and guaranteeing rights\n\nSee also: [Federalist Party](/wiki/Federalist_Party \"Federalist Party\"),\n[Annapolis Convention (1786)](/wiki/Annapolis_Convention_\\(1786\\) \"Annapolis\nConvention \\(1786\\)\"), and [United States Bill of\nRights](/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights \"United States Bill of Rights\")\n\nThe war finally ended in 1783 and was followed by a period of prosperity. The\nnational government was still operating under the Articles of Confederation\nand was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded\nby the states to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into those areas,\nwith Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee becoming states in the 1790s.[93]\n\nHowever, the national government had no money to pay either the war debts owed\nto European nations and the private banks, or to pay Americans who had been\ngiven millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war.\nNationalists led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and other veterans feared\nthat the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even\ninternal revolts such as the [Shays' Rebellion](/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion\n\"Shays' Rebellion\") of 1786 in Massachusetts.\n\nCalling themselves \"Federalists,\" the nationalists convinced Congress to call\nthe [Philadelphia Convention](/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention \"Philadelphia\nConvention\") in 1787.[94] It adopted a new\n[Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States \"Constitution of the\nUnited States\") that provided for a much stronger federal government,\nincluding an effective executive in a [check-and-\nbalance](/wiki/Separation_of_powers \"Separation of powers\") system with the\njudiciary and legislature.[95] The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a\nfierce debate in the states over the nature of the proposed new government.\nThe new government under President George Washington took office in New York\nin March 1789.[96] Amendments to the Constitution were spearheaded in Congress\nby [James Madison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\") as assurances to those\nwho were cautious about federal power, guaranteeing many of the [inalienable\nrights](/wiki/Inalienable_rights \"Inalienable rights\") that formed a\nfoundation for the revolution. The amendments were ratified by the states in\n1791.\n\n### National debt\n\nFurther information: [United States public\ndebt](/wiki/United_States_public_debt \"United States public debt\") and\n[Alexander Hamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\")\n\nThe national debt fell into three categories after the American Revolution.\nThe first was the $12 million owed to foreigners, mostly money borrowed from\nFrance. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value.\nThe national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25\nmillion to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the\nrevolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of\n[promissory notes](/wiki/Promissory_note \"Promissory note\") issued during the\nRevolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these\npayments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government\nthat would pay these debts eventually.\n\nThe war expenses of the individual states added up to $114 million compared to\n$37 million by the central government.[97] In 1790, Congress combined the\nremaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts into one national\ndebt totaling $80 million at the recommendation of first Secretary of the\nTreasury Alexander Hamilton. Everyone received face value for wartime\ncertificates, so that the national honor would be sustained and the national\ncredit established.[98]\n\n## Ideology and factions\n\nThe population of the 13 Colonies was not homogeneous in their political views\nand attitudes. Loyalties and allegiances varied widely within regions and\ncommunities and even within families, and sometimes shifted during the course\nof the Revolution.\n\n### Ideology behind the Revolution\n\nMain articles: [Age of Enlightenment](/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment \"Age of\nEnlightenment\"), [American Enlightenment](/wiki/American_Enlightenment\n\"American Enlightenment\"), [Liberalism in the United\nStates](/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States \"Liberalism in the United\nStates\"), and [Republicanism in the United\nStates](/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States \"Republicanism in the United\nStates\")\n\nThe American Enlightenment was a critical precursor of the American\nRevolution. Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the\nconcepts of Natural Law, Natural Rights, Consent of the Governed,\nIndividualism, Property Rights, Self-Ownership, Self-Determination,\nliberalism, republicanism and fear of corruption. Collectively, the acceptance\nof these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an\nintellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and\nsocial identity.[99]\n\n#### Liberalism\n\nMain article: [Liberalism in the United\nStates](/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States \"Liberalism in the United\nStates\")\n\nPart of [a

He\nargued that all humans were created equally free, and governments therefore\nneeded the \"consent of the governed.\"[103] In late eighteenth-century America,\nbelief was still widespread in \"equality by creation\" and \"rights by\ncreation\".[104]\n\nThe theory of the \"[social contract](/wiki/Social_contract \"Social contract\")\"\ninfluenced the belief among many of the Founders that among the \"natural\nrights\" of man was the [right of the people to overthrow their\nleaders](/wiki/Right_of_revolution \"Right of revolution\"), should those\nleaders betray the historic [rights of Englishmen](/wiki/Rights_of_Englishmen\n\"Rights of Englishmen\").[105][106] In terms of writing state and national\nconstitutions, the Americans heavily

 \nA central motivating force behind the overthrow of monarchy and aristocracy\nwas the American embrace of a political ideology called\n\"republicanism\",[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] which was dominant in the colonies by 1775 but\nof minor importance back in Great Britain.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] The\nrepublicanism was inspired by the \"[country\nparty](/wiki/Whig_\\(British_political_party\\) \"Whig \\(British political\nparty\\)\")\" in Great Britain, whose critique of British government emphasized\nthat [corruption](/wiki/Political_corruption \"Political corruption\") was a\nterrible reality in Great Britain.[107] Americans feared that the corruption\nwas crossing the Atlantic; the commitment of most Americans to republican\nvalues and to their rights energized the revolution, as Britain was\nincreasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests.\nBritain seemed to threaten the established liberties that Americans\nenjoyed.[108] The greatest threat to liberty was depicted as corruption—not\njust in [London](/wiki/London \"London\") but at home, as well. The colonists\nassociated it with luxury, and especially with inherited aristocracy, which\nthey condemned.[109]\n\nThe Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly\n[Samuel Adams](/wiki/Samuel_Adams \"Samuel Adams\"), [Patrick\nHenry](/wiki/Patrick_Henry \"Patrick Henry\"), [John Adams](/wiki/John_Adams\n\"John Adams\"), [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin \"Benjamin\nFranklin\"), [Thomas Jefferson](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\"),\n[Thomas Paine](/wiki/Thomas_Paine \"Thomas Paine\"), [George\nWashington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\"), [James\nMadison](/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\"), and [Alexander\nHamilton](/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\"),[110] which required\nmen to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires. Men had a civic duty to\nbe prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their\ncountrymen. John Adams wrote to [Mercy Otis Warren](/wiki/Mercy_Otis_Warren\n\"Mercy Otis Warren\") in 1776, agreeing with some\n[classical](/wiki/Classical_antiquity \"Classical antiquity\") Greek and Roman\nthinkers in that \"Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public\nVirtue is the only Foundation of Republics.\" He continued:\n\n> There must be a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest,\n> Honour, Power, and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there\n> can be no Republican Government, nor any real Liberty. And this public\n> Passion must be Superior to all private Passions. Men must be ready, they\n> must pride themselves, and be happy to sacrifice their private Pleasures,\n> Passions, and Interests, nay their private Friendships and dearest\n> connections, when they Stand in Competition with the Rights of society.[111]\n\nFor women, \"[republican motherhood](/wiki/Republican_motherhood \"Republican\nmotherhood\")\" became the ideal, exemplified by [Abigail\nAdams](/wiki/Abigail_Adams \"Abigail Adams\") and [Mercy Otis\nWarren](/wiki/Mercy_Otis_Warren \"Mercy Otis Warren\"); the first duty of the\nrepublican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid\nluxury and ostentation.[112]\n\n##### Fusing republicanism and liberalism\n\n[![Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, published in\n1776](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Commonsense.jpg/220px-\nCommonsense.jpg)](/wiki/File:Commonsense.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Commonsense.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Thomas Paine](/wiki/Thomas_Paine \"Thomas Paine\")'s pamphlet _[Common\nSense](/wiki/Common_Sense_\\(pamphlet\\) \"Common Sense \\(pamphlet\\)\")_ ,\npublished in 1776\n\nSome republics had emerged throughout history, such as the [Roman\nRepublic](/wiki/Roman_Republic \"Roman Republic\") of the ancient world, but\nnone ever existed that was based on liberal principles. Thomas Paine's\npamphlet _[Common Sense](/wiki/Common_Sense_\\(pamphlet\\) \"Common Sense\n\\(pamphlet\\)\")_ appeared in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It\nwas widely distributed and loaned, and often read aloud in\n[taverns](/wiki/Tavern#North_America \"Tavern\"), contributing significantly to\nspreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism together, bolstering\nenthusiasm for separation from Great Britain, and encouraging recruitment for\nthe Continental Army.[113]\n\nPaine provided a new and widely accepted argument for independence by\nadvocating a complete break with history. _Common Sense_ is oriented to the\nfuture in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It\noffered a solution for Americans disgusted and alarmed at the threat of\ntyranny.[113]\n\n#### Impact of Great Awakening\n\nMain article: [First Great Awakening](/wiki/First_Great_Awakening \"First Great\nAwakening\")\n\n[Dissenting](/wiki/Dissenter \"Dissenter\") churches of the day (i.e.,\nProtestant, non-[Church of England](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of\nEngland\")) were, in the words of Patricia Bonomi, the \"school of\n[democracy](/wiki/Democracy \"Democracy\").\"[114] President [John\nWitherspoon](/wiki/John_Witherspoon \"John Witherspoon\") of the College of New\nJersey (now [Princeton University](/wiki/Princeton_University \"Princeton\nUniversity\")) wrote widely circulated sermons linking the American Revolution\nto the teachings of the Bible. Throughout the colonies, dissenting Protestant\nministers ([Congregationalist](/wiki/Congregationalism_in_the_United_States\n\"Congregationalism in the United States\"), [Baptist](/wiki/Baptists\n\"Baptists\"), and [Presbyterian](/wiki/Presbyterianism \"Presbyterianism\"))\npreached Revolutionary themes in their sermons, while most Church of England\nclergymen preached loyalty to the king, the [titular\nhead](/wiki/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England \"Supreme Governor of the\nChurch of England\") of the English state church.[115] Religious motivation for\nfighting tyranny transcended socioeconomic lines to encompass rich and poor,\nmen and women, frontiersmen and townsmen, farmers and merchants.[114]\n\nThe Declaration also referred to the \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" as\njustification for the Americans' separation from the British monarchy. Most\neighteenth-century Americans believed that nature, the entire universe, was\nGod's creation.[116] Therefore, he was \"Nature's God.\" Everything, including\nman, was part of the \"universal order of things\", which began with God and was\npervaded and directed by his providence.[117] Accordingly, the signers of the\nDeclaration professed their \"firm reliance on the Protection of divine\nProvidence.\" And they appealed to \"the Supreme Judge [God] for the rectitude\nof [their] intentions.\"[118] Like most of his countrymen, [George\nWashington](/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\") was firmly convinced\nthat he was an instrument of providence, to the benefit of the American people\nand of all humanity.[119]\n\nHistorian [Bernard Bailyn](/wiki/Bernard_Bailyn \"Bernard Bailyn\") argues that\nthe evangelicalism of the era challenged traditional notions of natural\nhierarchy by preaching that the Bible teaches that all men are equal, so that\nthe true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not in his class.[120]\nKidd argues that religious [disestablishment](/wiki/The_Establishment \"The\nEstablishment\"), belief in a God as the source of [human\nrights](/wiki/Human_rights \"Human rights\"), and shared convictions about sin,\nvirtue, and [divine providence](/wiki/Divine_providence \"Divine providence\")\nworked together to unite rationalists and evangelicals and thus encouraged\nAmerican defiance of the Empire. Bailyn, on the other hand, denies that\nreligion played such a critical role.[121] Alan Heimert argues that New Light\nantiauthoritarianism was essential to furthering democracy in colonial\nAmerican society and set the stage for a confrontation with British\nmonarchical and aristocratic rule.[122]\n\nSee also: [List of clergy in the American\nRevolution](/wiki/List_of_clergy_in_the_American_Revolution \"List of clergy in\nthe American Revolution\")\n\n### Class and psychology of the factions\n\nLooking back, John Adams concluded in 1818:\n\n> The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in\n> the minds and hearts of the people ... This radical change in the\n> principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people was the real\n> American Revolution.[123]\n\nIn terms of class, Loyalists tended to have longstanding social and economic\nconnections to British merchants and government; for instance, prominent\nmerchants in major port cities such as New York, Boston and Charleston tended\nto be Loyalists, as did men involved with the [fur trade](/wiki/Fur_trade \"Fur\ntrade\") along the northern frontier.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] In\naddition, officials of colonial government and their staffs, those who had\nestablished positions and status to maintain, favored maintaining relations\nwith Great Britain. They often were linked to British families in England by\nmarriage as well.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nBy contrast, Patriots by number tended to be [yeomen\nfarmers](/wiki/Yeoman#United_States \"Yeoman\"), especially in the frontier\nareas of New York and the backcountry of Pennsylvania, Virginia and down the\nAppalachian mountains.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] They were craftsmen and small merchants.\nLeaders of both the Patriots and the Loyalists were men of educated,\npropertied classes. The Patriots included many prominent men of the [planter\nclass](/wiki/Planter_\\(American_South\\) \"Planter \\(American South\\)\") from\nVirginia and South Carolina, for instance, who became leaders during the\nRevolution, and formed the new government at the national and state\nlevels.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation\nneeded\")_]\n\nTo understand the opposing groups, historians have assessed evidence of their\nhearts and minds. In the mid-20th century, historian [Leonard Woods\nLabaree](/wiki/Leonard_Woods_Labaree \"Leonard Woods Labaree\") identified eight\ncharacteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative;\nopposite traits to those characteristic of the Patriots.[124] Older and better\nestablished men, Loyalists tended to resist innovation. They thought\nresistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate\ngovernment—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their\nside.[125][126]\n\nLoyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as\nburning houses and [tarring and feathering](/wiki/Tarring_and_feathering\n\"Tarring and feathering\"). Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and\nresisted the Patriots' demand to declare their opposition to the Crown. Many\nLoyalists, especially merchants in the port cities, had maintained strong and\nlong-standing relations with Britain (often with business and family links to\nother parts of the British Empire).[125][126]\n\nMany Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually, but\nthey were fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule.\nIn contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic\nefforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner, was a desire to seize the\ninitiative.[125][126] Labaree also wrote that Loyalists were pessimists who\nlacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.[124]\n\nHistorians in the early 20th century, such as [J. Franklin\nJameson](/wiki/J._Franklin_Jameson \"J. Franklin Jameson\"), examined the class\ncomposition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence of a class war inside\nthe revolution.[127] In the last 50 years, historians have largely abandoned\nthat interpretation, emphasizing instead the high level of ideological\nunity.[128] Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a\n'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated more likely to become\nofficers in the Army.[129][130]\n\nIdeological demands always came first: the Patriots viewed independence as a\nmeans to gain freedom from British oppression and taxation and, above all, to\nreassert what they considered to be their rights as English subjects. Most\nyeomen farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants joined the Patriot cause to\ndemand more political equality. They were especially successful in\nPennsylvania but less so in New England, where John Adams attacked Thomas\nPaine's _Common Sense_ for the \"absurd democratical notions\" it\nproposed.[129][130]\n\n### King George III\n\nMain article: [George III of Great Britain](/wiki/George_III_of_Great_Britain\n\"George III of Great Britain\")\n\nThe war became a personal issue for [the\nking](/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom \"George III of the United\nKingdom\"), fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken\nas weakness by the Americans. The king also sincerely believed he was\ndefending Britain's constitution against usurpers, rather than opposing\npatriots fighting for their natural rights.[131]\n\n### Patriots\n\nMain article: [Patriot (American\nRevolution)](/wiki/Patriot_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Patriot \\(American\nRevolution\\)\")\n\nFurther information: [Sons of Liberty](/wiki/Sons_of_Liberty \"Sons of\nLiberty\")\n\nAt the time, revolutionaries were called \"Patriots\", \"Whigs\", \"Congress-men\",\nor \"Americans\". They included a full range of social and economic classes, but\nwere unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold\nthe principles of [republicanism](/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States\n\"Republicanism in the United States\") in terms of rejecting monarchy and\naristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens.\nNewspapers were strongholds of patriotism (although there were a few Loyalist\npapers), and printed many pamphlets, announcements, patriotic letters and\npronouncements.[132]\n\nAccording to historian Robert Calhoon, the consensus of historians is that\n40–45% of the white population in the Thirteen Colonies supported the\nPatriots' cause, 15–20% supported the Loyalists, and the remainder were\nneutral or kept a low profile.[133] Mark Lender explores why ordinary folk\nbecame insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with\nthe ideological rationales being offered. They held very strongly a sense of\n\"rights\" that they felt the British were violating – rights that stressed\nlocal autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly\nsensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the British\nresponse to the Boston Tea Party. The arrival in Boston of the British Army\nheightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for\nrevenge. They had faith that God was on their side.[134]\n\n### Loyalists\n\nMain article: [Loyalist (American\nRevolution)](/wiki/Loyalist_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Loyalist \\(American\nRevolution\\)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Mobbing_the_Tories_-\n_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16960.jpg/250px-Mobbing_the_Tories_-\n_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16960.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mobbing_the_Tories_-\n_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16960.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Mobbing_the_Tories_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16960.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nMobbing of a Loyalist by American Patriots in 1775–76\n\nThe consensus of scholars is that about 15–20% of the white population\nremained loyal to the British Crown.[135] Those who actively supported the\nking were known at the time as \"Loyalists\", \"Tories\", or \"King's men\". The\nLoyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it.\nLoyalists were typically older, less willing to break with old loyalties,\noften connected to the [Church of England](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of\nEngland\"), and included many established merchants with strong business\nconnections across the Empire, as well as royal officials such as Thomas\nHutchinson of Boston.[136] There were 500 to 1000 [black\nloyalists](/wiki/Black_Loyalist \"Black Loyalist\") who were held as slaves by\npatriots, escaped to British lines and joined the British army. Most died of\ndisease but Britain took the survivors to Canada as free men.\n\nThe revolution could divide families. The most dramatic example was when\n[William Franklin](/wiki/William_Franklin \"William Franklin\"), son of Benjamin\nFranklin and royal governor of the [Province of New\nJersey](/wiki/Province_of_New_Jersey \"Province of New Jersey\"), remained loyal\nto the Crown throughout the war; they never spoke again.[137] Recent\nimmigrants who had not been fully Americanized were also inclined to support\nthe King, such as recent Scottish settlers in the back country; among the more\nstriking examples of this, see [Flora\nMacDonald](/wiki/Flora_MacDonald_\\(Scottish_Jacobite\\) \"Flora MacDonald\n\\(Scottish Jacobite\\)\").[138]\n\nAfter the war, the great majority of the 450,000–500,000 Loyalists remained in\nAmerica and resumed normal lives. Some, such as [Samuel\nSeabury](/wiki/Samuel_Seabury_\\(1729%E2%80%931796\\) \"Samuel Seabury\n\\(1729–1796\\)\"), became prominent American leaders. Estimates vary, but about\n62,000 Loyalists relocated to Canada, and others to Britain (7,000) or to\nFlorida or the [West Indies](/wiki/West_Indies \"West Indies\") (9,000). The\nexiles represented approximately 2% of the total population of the\ncolonies.[139] Nearly all [black loyalists](/wiki/Black_Loyalist \"Black\nLoyalist\") left for Nova Scotia, Florida, or England, where they could remain\nfree.[140] When Loyalists left the [South](/wiki/Southern_United_States\n\"Southern United States\") in 1783, they took thousands of their slaves with\nthem to be slaves in the British West Indies.[139]\n\n### Neutrals\n\nA minority of uncertain size tried to stay neutral in the war. Most kept a low\nprofile, but the [Quakers](/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends \"Religious\nSociety of Friends\"), especially in Pennsylvania, were the most important\ngroup to speak out for neutrality. As Patriots declared independence, the\nQuakers, who continued to do business with the British, were attacked as\nsupporters of British rule, \"contrivers and authors of seditious publications\"\ncritical of the revolutionary cause.[141] Though the majority of Quakers\nattempted to remain neutral, a sizable number of [Quakers in the American\nRevolution](/wiki/Quakers_in_the_American_Revolution \"Quakers in the American\nRevolution\") nevertheless participated to some degree.\n\n### Role of women\n\n[![Abigail\nAdams](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Abigail_Adams.jpg/220px-\nAbigail_Adams.jpg)](/wiki/File:Abigail_Adams.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Abigail_Adams.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[Abigail Adams](/wiki/Abigail_Adams \"Abigail Adams\")\n\nMain article: [Women in the American\nRevolution](/wiki/Women_in_the_American_Revolution \"Women in the American\nRevolution\")\n\nWomen contributed to the American Revolution in many ways, and were involved\non both sides. While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women,\nordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as\nPatriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil,\nand domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on\nthe British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending\nfor soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like [Deborah\nSamson](/wiki/Deborah_Samson \"Deborah Samson\"), fighting disguised as men.\nAlso, [Mercy Otis Warren](/wiki/Mercy_Otis_Warren \"Mercy Otis Warren\") held\nmeetings in her house and cleverly attacked Loyalists with her creative plays\nand histories.[142] Above all, they continued the agricultural work at home to\nfeed their families and the armies. They maintained their families during\ntheir husbands' absences and sometimes after their deaths.[143]\n\nAmerican women were integral to the success of the boycott of British\ngoods,[144] as the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea\nand cloth. Women had to return to knitting goods, and to spinning and weaving\ntheir own cloth — skills that had fallen into disuse. In 1769, the women of\nBoston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in [Middletown,\nMassachusetts](/wiki/Middleton,_Massachusetts \"Middleton, Massachusetts\") wove\n20,522 yards (18,765 m) of cloth.[143]\n\nA crisis of political loyalties could disrupt the fabric of colonial America\nwomen's social worlds: whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to\nthe King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women\nfrom former connections. A woman's loyalty to her husband, once a private\ncommitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America\ncommitted to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare,\nwas granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.[145][146]\n\n## Other participants\n\nFurther information: [Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/Diplomacy_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Diplomacy in the\nAmerican Revolutionary War\")\n\n### France\n\nMain article: [France in the American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/France_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"France in the American\nRevolutionary War\")\n\nIn early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the\nSpanish secretly added funds. Each country spent one million \"livres\ntournaises\" to buy munitions. A [dummy corporation](/wiki/Dummy_corporation\n\"Dummy corporation\") run by [Pierre Beaumarchais](/wiki/Pierre_Beaumarchais\n\"Pierre Beaumarchais\") concealed their activities. American rebels obtained\nsome munitions through the [Dutch Republic](/wiki/Dutch_Republic \"Dutch\nRepublic\") as well as French and Spanish ports in the [West\nIndies](/wiki/West_Indies \"West Indies\").[147]\n\n### Spain\n\nMain article: [Spain in the American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/Spain_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Spain in the American\nRevolutionary War\")\n\nSpain did not officially recognize the U.S. but became an informal ally when\nit declared war on Britain on June 21, 1779. [Bernardo de Gálvez y\nMadrid](/wiki/Bernardo_de_G%C3%A1lvez_y_Madrid \"Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid\"),\ngeneral of the Spanish forces in [New Spain](/wiki/New_Spain \"New Spain\"),\nalso served as governor of Louisiana. He led an expedition of colonial troops\nto force the British out of Florida and keep open a vital conduit for\nsupplies.[148]\n\n### American Indians\n\nMain article: [Native Americans in the United\nStates](/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States \"Native Americans in the\nUnited States\")\n\nFurther information: [Western theater of the American Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/Western_theater_of_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Western theater\nof the American Revolutionary War\")\n\nMost American Indians rejected pleas that they remain neutral and supported\nthe British Crown, both because of trading relationships and Britain's effort\nto establish an Indian reserve and prohibit Colonial settlement west of the\nAppalachian Mountains. The great majority of the 200,000 Indians east of the\nMississippi distrusted the Colonists and supported the British cause, hoping\nto forestall continued colonial encroachment on their territories.[149] Those\ntribes that were more closely involved in Colonial trade tended to side with\nthe Colonists, although political factors were important, as well.\n\nMost Indians did not participate directly in the war, except for warriors and\nbands associated with four of the [Iroquois](/wiki/Iroquois \"Iroquois\")\nnations in New York and Pennsylvania which allied with the British. The\nBritish did have other allies, especially in the upper Midwest. They provided\nIndians with funding and weapons to attack American outposts. Some Indians\ntried to remain neutral, seeing little value in joining what they perceived to\nbe a European conflict, and fearing reprisals from whichever side they\nopposed. The [Oneida](/wiki/Oneida_tribe \"Oneida tribe\") and\n[Tuscarora](/wiki/Tuscarora_people \"Tuscarora people\") among the Iroquois of\ncentral and western New York supported the American cause.[150]\n\nThe British provided arms to Indians who were led by\n[Loyalists](/wiki/Loyalists \"Loyalists\") in war parties to raid frontier\nsettlements from the [Carolinas](/wiki/Province_of_Carolina \"Province of\nCarolina\") to New York. They killed many settlers on the frontier, especially\nin Pennsylvania and New York's Mohawk Valley.\n\nIn 1776, [Cherokee](/wiki/Cherokee \"Cherokee\") war parties attacked American\nColonists all along the southern frontier of the uplands throughout the\n[Washington District, North\nCarolina](/wiki/Washington_District,_North_Carolina \"Washington District,\nNorth Carolina\") (now Tennessee) and the Kentucky wilderness area.[151] They\nwould launch raids with roughly 200 warriors, as seen in the\n[Cherokee–American wars](/wiki/Cherokee%E2%80%93American_wars\n\"Cherokee–American wars\"); they could not mobilize enough forces to invade\nColonial areas without the help of allies, most often the\n[Creek](/wiki/Muscogee_\\(Creek\\) \"Muscogee \\(Creek\\)\"). The [Chickamauga\nCherokee](/wiki/Chickamauga_Cherokee \"Chickamauga Cherokee\") under [Dragging\nCanoe](/wiki/Dragging_Canoe \"Dragging Canoe\") allied themselves closely with\nthe British, and fought on for an additional decade after the signing of the\nTreaty of Paris.\n\n[Joseph Brant](/wiki/Joseph_Brant \"Joseph Brant\") of the powerful [Mohawk\nnation](/wiki/Mohawk_nation \"Mohawk nation\"), part of the Iroquois Confederacy\nbased in New York, was the most prominent Indian leader against the Colonial\nforces. In 1778 and 1780, he led 300 Iroquois warriors and 100 white Loyalists\nin multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and\nPennsylvania, killing many settlers and destroying villages, crops, and\nstores.[152] The Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga of the Iroquois Confederacy also\nallied with the British against the Americans.[153]\n\nIn 1779, the Colonists retaliated with an American army under [John\nSullivan](/wiki/John_Sullivan_\\(general\\) \"John Sullivan \\(general\\)\") which\nraided and destroyed 40 empty Iroquois villages in central and western New\nYork.[153] Sullivan's forces systematically burned the villages and destroyed\nabout 160,000 bushels of corn that composed the winter food supply. Facing\nstarvation and homeless for the winter, the Iroquois fled to the Niagara Falls\narea and to Canada, mostly to what became Ontario. The British resettled them\nthere after the war, providing land grants as compensation for some of their\nlosses.[154]\n\nAt the peace conference following the war, the British ceded lands which they\ndid not really control, and did not consult their Indian allies. They\ntransferred control to the United States of all the land east of the\nMississippi and north of Florida. Calloway concludes:\n\n> Burned villages and crops, murdered chiefs, divided councils and civil wars,\n> migrations, towns and forts choked with refugees, economic disruption,\n> breaking of ancient traditions, losses in battle and to disease and hunger,\n> betrayal to their enemies, all made the American Revolution one of the\n> darkest periods in American Indian history.[155]\n\nThe British did not give up their forts in the West until 1796 in what is now\nthe eastern Midwest, stretching from Ohio to Wisconsin; they kept alive the\ndream of forming a satellite Indian nation there, which they called a Neutral\nIndian Zone. That goal was one of the causes of the [War of\n1812](/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\").[156][157]\n\n### Black Americans\n\nMain article: [African Americans in the Revolutionary\nWar](/wiki/African_Americans_in_the_Revolutionary_War \"African Americans in\nthe Revolutionary War\")\n\nFree blacks in the North and South fought on both sides of the Revolution, but\n[most fought for the\nPatriots](/wiki/Military_history_of_African_Americans#Revolutionary_War\n\"Military history of African Americans\"). Gary Nash reports that there were\nabout 9,000 black Patriots, counting the Continental Army and Navy, state\nmilitia units, privateers, wagoneers in the Army, servants to officers, and\nspies.[158] Ray Raphael notes that thousands did join the Loyalist cause, but\n\"a far larger number, free as well as slave, tried to further their interests\nby siding with the patriots.\" [159] [Crispus Attucks](/wiki/Crispus_Attucks\n\"Crispus Attucks\") was shot dead by British soldiers in the [Boston\nMassacre](/wiki/Boston_Massacre \"Boston Massacre\") in 1770 and is an iconic\nmartyr to Patriots.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Both sides offered freedom and re-settlement to\nslaves who were willing to fight for them, recruiting slaves whose owners\nsupported the opposing cause.[_[citation\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nMany black slaves sided with the Loyalists. Tens of thousands in the South\nused the turmoil of war to escape, and the southern plantation economies of\nSouth Carolina and Georgia especially were disrupted. During the Revolution,\nthe British tried to turn slavery against the Americans.[160] Historian [David\nBrion Davis](/wiki/David_Brion_Davis \"David Brion Davis\") explains the\ndifficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves:\n\n> But England greatly feared the effects of any such move on its own [West\n> Indies](/wiki/West_Indies \"West Indies\"), where Americans had already\n> aroused alarm over a possible threat to incite slave\n> [insurrections](/wiki/Insurrection \"Insurrection\"). The British elites also\n> understood that an all-out attack on one form of property could easily lead\n> to an assault on all boundaries of privilege and social order, as envisioned\n> by radical religious sects in Britain's seventeenth-century civil wars.[161]\n\nDavis underscored the British dilemma: \"Britain, when confronted by the\nrebellious American colonists, hoped to exploit their fear of [slave\nrevolts](/wiki/Slave_rebellion \"Slave rebellion\") while also reassuring the\nlarge number of slave-holding Loyalists and wealthy Caribbean planters and\nmerchants that their slave property would be secure\".[162] The Colonists,\nhowever, accused the British of encouraging slave revolts.[163]\n\nAmerican advocates of independence were commonly lampooned in Britain for what\nwas termed their hypocritical calls for freedom, at the same time that many of\ntheir leaders were planters who held hundreds of slaves. [Samuel\nJohnson](/wiki/Samuel_Johnson \"Samuel Johnson\") snapped, \"how is it we hear\nthe loudest yelps for liberty among the [slave] drivers of the Negroes?\"[164]\nBenjamin Franklin countered by criticizing the British self-congratulation\nabout \"the freeing of one Negro\" ([Somersett](/wiki/Somersett%27s_Case\n\"Somersett's Case\")) while they continued to permit the [Slave\nTrade](/wiki/Slave_Trade \"Slave Trade\").[165]\n\n[Phyllis Wheatley](/wiki/Phyllis_Wheatley \"Phyllis Wheatley\") was a black poet\nwho popularized the image of [Columbia](/wiki/Columbia_\\(name\\) \"Columbia\n\\(name\\)\") to represent America. She came to public attention when her _Poems\non Various Subjects, Religious and Moral_ appeared in 1773.[166]\n\nDuring the war, slaves escaped from New England and the mid-Atlantic area to\nBritish-occupied cities such as New York. The effects of the war were more\ndramatic in the South. In Virginia, royal governor Lord\n[Dunmore](/wiki/John_Murray,_4th_Earl_of_Dunmore \"John Murray, 4th Earl of\nDunmore\") recruited black men into the British forces with the promise of\nfreedom, protection for their families, and land grants. Tens of thousands of\nslaves escaped to British lines throughout the South, causing dramatic losses\nto slaveholders and disrupting cultivation and harvesting of crops. For\ninstance, [South Carolina](/wiki/South_Carolina \"South Carolina\") was\nestimated to have lost about 25,000 slaves to flight, migration, or\ndeath—amounting to one third of its slave population. From 1770 to 1790, the\nblack proportion of the population (mostly slaves) in South Carolina dropped\nfrom 60.5 percent to 43.8 percent, and from 45.2 percent to 36.1 percent in\n[Georgia](/wiki/Georgia_\\(U.S._state\\) \"Georgia \\(U.S. state\\)\").[167]\n\nBritish forces gave transportation to 10,000 slaves when they evacuated\n[Savannah](/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia \"Savannah, Georgia\") and\n[Charleston](/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina \"Charleston, South Carolina\"),\ncarrying through on their promise.[168] They evacuated and resettled more than\n3,000 [Black Loyalists](/wiki/Black_Loyalist \"Black Loyalist\") from New York\nto [Nova Scotia](/wiki/Nova_Scotia \"Nova Scotia\"), [Upper\nCanada](/wiki/Upper_Canada \"Upper Canada\"), and [Lower\nCanada](/wiki/Lower_Canada \"Lower Canada\"). Others sailed with the British to\nEngland or were resettled as freedmen in the [West Indies](/wiki/West_Indies\n\"West Indies\") of the Caribbean. But slaves who were carried to the Caribbean\nunder control of Loyalist masters generally remained slaves until British\nabolition in its colonies in 1834. More than 1,200 of the Black Loyalists of\nNova Scotia later resettled in the British colony of [Sierra\nLeone](/wiki/History_of_Sierra_Leone \"History of Sierra Leone\"), where they\nbecame leaders of the [Krio](/wiki/Sierra_Leone_Creole_people \"Sierra Leone\nCreole people\") ethnic group of Freetown and the later national government.\nMany of their descendants still live in Sierra Leone, as well as other African\ncountries.[169]\n\n## Effects of the Revolution\n\n### Loyalist expatriation\n\nAbout 60,000 to 70,000 Loyalists left the newly founded republic; some\nmigrated to Britain. The remainder, known as [United Empire\nLoyalists](/wiki/United_Empire_Loyalists \"United Empire Loyalists\"), received\nland and subsidies for resettlement in British colonies in North America,\nespecially [Quebec](/wiki/Province_of_Quebec_\\(1763-1791\\) \"Province of Quebec\n\\(1763-1791\\)\") (concentrating in the [Eastern\nTownships](/wiki/Eastern_Townships \"Eastern Townships\")), [Prince Edward\nIsland](/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island \"Prince Edward Island\"), and [Nova\nScotia](/wiki/Nova_Scotia \"Nova Scotia\").[170] The new colonies of Upper\nCanada (now [Ontario](/wiki/Ontario \"Ontario\")) and [New\nBrunswick](/wiki/New_Brunswick \"New Brunswick\") were expressly created by\nBritain for their benefit, where the Crown awarded land to Loyalists as\ncompensation for losses in the United States. Britain wanted to develop the\nfrontier of Upper Canada on a British colonial model. But about 80% of the\nLoyalists stayed in the United States and became full, loyal citizens; some of\nthe exiles later returned to the U.S.[171]\n\n### Interpretations\n\nInterpretations about the effect of the Revolution vary. Contemporary\nparticipants referred to the events as \"the revolution\".[172] Greene argues\nthat the events were not \"revolutionary\", as the relationships and property\nrights of colonial society were not transformed: a distant government was\nsimply replaced with a local one; the Revolution is still sometimes known\noutside the United States as the American War of Independence.[173]\n\nHistorians such as [Bernard Bailyn](/wiki/Bernard_Bailyn \"Bernard Bailyn\"),\n[Gordon Wood](/wiki/Gordon_S._Wood \"Gordon S. Wood\"), and [Edmund\nMorgan](/wiki/Edmund_Morgan_\\(historian\\) \"Edmund Morgan \\(historian\\)\")\naccept the contemporary view of the participants that the American Revolution\nwas a unique and radical event that produced deep changes and had a profound\neffect on world affairs, based on an increasing belief in the principles of\nthe Enlightenment, as reflected in how liberalism was understood during the\nperiod, and republicanism. These were demonstrated by a leadership and\ngovernment that espoused protection of natural rights, and a system of laws\nchosen by the people.[174] However, what was then considered \"the people\" was\nstill mostly restricted to free white males who were able to pass a property-\nqualification.[175][176] Such a restriction made a significant gain of the\nrevolution in the short term irrelevant to women, African Americans and\nslaves, poor white men, youth, and Native Americans.[177][178] Only with the\ndevelopment of the American system over the following centuries would \"a\ngovernment by the people\", promised by the revolution, be won for a greater\nproportion of the population.[176]\n\nMorgan has argued that in terms of long-term impact on American society and\nvalues:\n\n    The Revolution did revolutionize social relations. It did displace the deference, the patronage, the social divisions that had determined the way people viewed one another for centuries and still view one another in much of the world. It did give to ordinary people a pride and power, not to say an arrogance, that have continued to shock visitors from less favored lands. It may have left standing a host of inequalities that have troubled us ever since. But it generated the egalitarian view of human society that makes them troubling and makes our world so different from the own in which the revolutionists had grown up.[179]\n\n### Inspiring all colonies\n\nFurther information: [Atlantic Revolutions](/wiki/Atlantic_Revolutions\n\"Atlantic Revolutions\")\n\nAfter the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics became possible in the\nformer colonies.[180] The rights of the people were incorporated into state\nconstitutions. Concepts of liberty, individual rights, equality among men and\nhostility toward corruption became incorporated as core values of liberal\nrepublicanism. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the\nchallenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government\nrests on the [consent of the governed](/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed \"Consent\nof the governed\"). The example of the first successful revolution against a\nEuropean empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form\nof democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial\npeoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing\nnations with directly elected representative government.[181]\n\nThe Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain, was the next country to sign a\ntreaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782.[62] On April 3, 1783,\nAmbassador Extraordinary [Gustaf Philip Creutz](/wiki/Gustaf_Philip_Creutz\n\"Gustaf Philip Creutz\"), representing King [Gustav III of\nSweden](/wiki/Gustav_III_of_Sweden \"Gustav III of Sweden\"), and Benjamin\nFranklin, signed a [Treaty of Amity and\nCommerce](/wiki/Treaty_of_Amity_and_Commerce_\\(USA%E2%80%93Sweden\\) \"Treaty of\nAmity and Commerce \\(USA–Sweden\\)\") with the U.S.[62]\n\nThe American Revolution was the first wave of the [Atlantic\nRevolutions](/wiki/Atlantic_Revolutions \"Atlantic Revolutions\"): the [French\nRevolution](/wiki/French_Revolution \"French Revolution\"), the [Haitian\nRevolution](/wiki/Haitian_Revolution \"Haitian Revolution\"), and the [Latin\nAmerican wars of independence](/wiki/Latin_American_wars_of_independence\n\"Latin American wars of independence\"). Aftershocks reached Ireland in the\n[Irish Rebellion of 1798](/wiki/Irish_Rebellion_of_1798 \"Irish Rebellion of\n1798\"), in the [Polish–Lithuanian\nCommonwealth](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth \"Polish–Lithuanian\nCommonwealth\"), and in the Netherlands.[182][183]\n\nThe Revolution had a strong, immediate influence in Great Britain, Ireland,\nthe Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish\n[Whigs](/wiki/British_Whig_Party \"British Whig Party\") spoke in favor of the\nAmerican cause. In Ireland, there was a profound impact; the Protestants who\ncontrolled Ireland were demanding more and more self-rule. Under the\nleadership of [Henry Grattan](/wiki/Henry_Grattan \"Henry Grattan\"), the so-\ncalled \"[Patriots](/wiki/Irish_Patriot_Party#Grattan.27s_Patriots \"Irish\nPatriot Party\")\" forced the reversal of mercantilist prohibitions against\ntrade with other British colonies. The King and his cabinet in London could\nnot risk another rebellion on the American model, and made a series of\nconcessions to the Patriot faction in Dublin. Armed Protestant volunteer units\nwere set up to protect against an invasion from France. As in America, so too\nin Ireland the King no longer had a monopoly of lethal force.[184]\n\nThe Revolution, along with the [Dutch Revolt](/wiki/Dutch_Revolt \"Dutch\nRevolt\") (end of the 16th century) and the 17th century [English Civil\nWar](/wiki/English_Civil_War \"English Civil War\"), was among the examples of\noverthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the\nera of the French Revolution, such as [Marquis de\nLafayette](/wiki/Marquis_de_Lafayette \"Marquis de Lafayette\"). The American\nDeclaration of Independence influenced the French [Declaration of the Rights\nof Man and the Citizen](/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_the_Citizen\n\"Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen\") of 1789.[185][186] The\nspirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all\nthe Northern states and the Northwest Territory, with New Jersey the last in\n1804. States such as New Jersey and New York adopted gradual emancipation,\nwhich kept some people as slaves for more than two decades longer.[187]\n\n### Status of American women\n\nThe democratic ideals of the Revolution inspired changes in the roles of\nwomen.[188]\n\nThe concept of [republican motherhood](/wiki/Republican_motherhood \"Republican\nmotherhood\") was inspired by this period and reflects the importance of\n[Republicanism as the dominant American\nideology](/wiki/Revolutionary_republicanism \"Revolutionary republicanism\"). It\nassumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens.\nWomen were considered to have the essential role of instilling their children\nwith values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife's\nrelationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection\ninstead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital\nrelationship. In addition, many women contributed to the war effort through\nfundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.\n\nThe traditional constraints gave way to more liberal conditions for women.\nPatriarchy faded as an ideal; young people had more freedom to choose their\nspouses and more often used birth control to regulate the size of their\nfamilies. Society emphasized the role of mothers in child rearing, especially\nthe patriotic goal of raising republican children rather than those locked\ninto aristocratic value systems. There was more permissiveness in child-\nrearing. Patriot women married to Loyalists who left the state could get a\ndivorce and obtain control of the ex-husband's property.[189] Whatever gains\nthey had made, however, women still found themselves subordinated, legally and\nsocially, to their husbands, disfranchised and usually with only the role of\nmother open to them. But, some women earned livelihoods as midwives and in\nother roles in the community, which were not originally recognized as\nsignificant by men.\n\n[Abigail Adams](/wiki/Abigail_Adams \"Abigail Adams\") expressed to her husband,\nthe president, the desire of women to have a place in the new republic:\n\n> I desire you would remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable\n> to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands\n> of the Husbands.[190]\n\nZagarri in 2007 argued that the American Revolution created a continuing\ndebate on the rights of woman and an environment favorable to women's\nparticipation in U.S. politics. She asserts that for a brief decade, a\n\"comprehensive transformation in women's rights, roles, and responsibilities\nseemed not only possible but perhaps inevitable.\" But, the changes also\nengendered a backlash that set back the cause of women's rights and led to a\ngreater rigidity that marginalized women from political life.[191]\n\nFor more than thirty years, however, the 1776 [New Jersey State\nConstitution](/wiki/New_Jersey_State_Constitution \"New Jersey State\nConstitution\") gave the vote to \"all inhabitants\" who had a certain level of\nwealth, including unmarried women and blacks (not married women because they\ncould not own property separately from their husbands), until in 1807, when\nthat state legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean\nuniversal _white male_ [suffrage](/wiki/Suffrage \"Suffrage\"), excluding\npaupers.[192]\n\n### Status of African Americans\n\nIn the first two decades after the American Revolution, state legislatures and\nindividuals took actions to free numerous slaves, in part based on\nrevolutionary ideals. Northern states passed new constitutions that contained\nlanguage about equal rights or specifically abolished slavery; some states,\nsuch as New York and New Jersey, where slavery was more widespread, passed\nlaws by the end of the 18th century to abolish slavery by a gradual method; in\nNew York, the last slaves were freed in 1827.\n\nWhile no southern state abolished slavery, for a period individual owners\ncould free their slaves by personal decision, often providing for manumission\nin wills but sometimes filing deeds or court papers to free individuals.\nNumerous slaveholders who freed their slaves cited revolutionary ideals in\ntheir documents; others freed slaves as a reward for service. Records also\nsuggest that some slaveholders were freeing their own [mixed-\nrace](/wiki/Mixed-race \"Mixed-race\") children, born into slavery to slave\nmothers.\n\n### Memory\n\nSee also: [United States Bicentennial](/wiki/United_States_Bicentennial\n\"United States Bicentennial\")\n\n[![American revolution\nbicentennial.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/American_revolution_bicentennial.svg/250px-\nAmerican_revolution_bicentennial.svg.png)](/wiki/File:American_revolution_bicentennial.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:American_revolution_bicentennial.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Colonial_Williamsburg_Governors_Palace_Front_Dscn7232.jpg/220px-\nColonial_Williamsburg_Governors_Palace_Front_Dscn7232.jpg)](/wiki/File:Colonial_Williamsburg_Governors_Palace_Front_Dscn7232.jpg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Colonial_Williamsburg_Governors_Palace_Front_Dscn7232.jpg\n\"Enlarge\")\n\nGovernor's Palace, [Colonial Williamsburg](/wiki/Colonial_Williamsburg\n\"Colonial Williamsburg\"), a restored colonial city, Williamburg, Virginia\n\nThe American Revolution has a central place in the American memory.[193] As\nthe founding story, it is covered in the schools, memorialized by a national\nholiday, and commemorated in innumerable monuments. Thus [Independence\nDay](/wiki/Independence_Day_\\(United_States\\) \"Independence Day \\(United\nStates\\)\") (the \"Fourth of July\") is a major national holiday celebrated\nannually. Besides local sites such as Bunker Hill, one of the first national\npilgrimages for memorial tourists was [Mount Vernon](/wiki/Mount_Vernon \"Mount\nVernon\"), George Washington's estate (near [Washington\nCity](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\")), which attracted ten\nthousand visitors a year by the 1850s.[194]\n\nCrider points out that in the 1850s, editors and orators both North and South\nclaimed their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776, as they\nused the Revolution symbolically in their rhetoric.[195] Ryan, noting that the\nBicentennial was celebrated a year after the United States' humiliating 1975\nwithdrawal from Vietnam, says the Ford administration stressed the themes of\nrenewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values, and\npresented a nostalgic approach to 1776 that made it seem eternally young and\nfresh.[196]\n\nAlbanese argues that the Revolution became the main source of the non-\ndenominational \"[American civil religion](/wiki/American_civil_religion\n\"American civil religion\")\" that has shaped patriotism, and the memory and\nmeaning of the nation's birth ever since.[197] She says that specific battles\nare not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and\npeople have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). Thus she\npoints out the Revolution produced a [Moses](/wiki/Moses \"Moses\")-like leader\n(George Washington),[198] prophets (Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine), disciples\n(Alexander Hamilton, James Madison) and martyrs (Boston Massacre, Nathan\nHale), as well as devils (Benedict Arnold), sacred places (Valley Forge,\nBunker Hill), rituals (Boston Tea Party), emblems (the new flag), sacred\nholidays (Independence Day), and a holy scripture whose every sentence is\ncarefully studied and applied in current law cases (The Declaration of\nIndependence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights).[197]\n\n## See also\n\n  * [Bibliography of the American Revolutionary War](/wiki/Bibliography_of_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Bibliography of the American Revolutionary War\")\n  * [Timeline of the American Revolution](/wiki/Timeline_of_the_American_Revolution \"Timeline of the American Revolution\")\n  * [Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary War](/wiki/Diplomacy_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War \"Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary War\")\n  * [Founding Fathers of the United States](/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States \"Founding Fathers of the United States\")\n  * [Patriot (American Revolution)](/wiki/Patriot_\\(American_Revolution\\) \"Patriot \\(American Revolution\\)\")\n  * [Sons of Liberty](/wiki/Sons_of_Liberty \"Sons of Liberty\")\n  * [List of plays and films about the American Revolution](/wiki/List_of_plays_and_films_about_the_American_Revolution \"List of plays and films about the American Revolution\")\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Wood, _The Radicalism of the American Revolution_ (1992)\n  2. **Jump up ^** Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70\n  3. **Jump up ^** Lawrence Henry Gipson, \"The American revolution as an aftermath of the Great War for the Empire, 1754-1763.\" _Political Science Quarterly_ (1950): 86-104.[in JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2144276)\n  4. **Jump up ^** Pestana, Carla Gardina (2004).
