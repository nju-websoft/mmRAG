recommended\ndaily intake of folate in the US is 400 [micrograms](/wiki/Microgram\n\"Microgram\") from foods or [dietary supplements](/wiki/Dietary_supplement\n\"Dietary supplement\").[6] Folic acid is the form of folate used to treat\n[anemia](/wiki/Anemia \"Anemia\") caused by [folic acid\ndeficiency](/wiki/Folic_acid_deficiency \"Folic acid deficiency\").[4] Folic\nacid is also used as a [supplement](/wiki/Dietary_supplement \"Dietary\nsupplement\") by women during [pregnancy](/wiki/Pregnancy \"Pregnancy\") to\nprevent [neural tube defects](/wiki/Neural_tube_defect \"Neural tube defect\")\nin the baby.[4][7] Low levels in early [pregnancy](/wiki/Pregnancy\n\"Pregnancy\") are believed to be the cause of more than half of babies born\nwith [neural tube defects](/wiki/Neural_tube_defects \"Neural tube\ndefects\").[8] More than 50 countries use [fortification of certain\nfoods](/wiki/Food_fortification \"Food fortification\") with folic acid as a\nmeasure to decrease the rate of NTDs in the population.[9][10] Long term\nsupplementation is also associated with small reductions in the risk of\n[stroke](/wiki/Stroke \"Stroke\") and [cardiovascular\ndisease](/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease \"Cardiovascular disease\").[11] It may be\ntaken by mouth or by injection.[4]\n\nThere are no common side effects.[4] It is not known whether high doses over a\nlong period of time are of concern.[4] There are concerns that large amounts\nof folic acid might hide [vitamin B12 deficiency](/wiki/Vitamin_B12_deficiency\n\"Vitamin B12 deficiency\").[8] Folic acid is\n[essential](/wiki/Essential_nutrient \"Essential nutrient\") for the body to\nmake [DNA](/wiki/DNA \"DNA\"), [RNA](/wiki/RNA \"RNA\"), and metabolise [amino\nacids](/wiki/Amino_acids \"Amino acids\") which are required for [cell\ndivision](/wiki/Cell_division \"Cell division\").[8] As humans cannot make folic\nacid, it is required from the diet, making it an [essential\nvitamin](/wiki/Essential_vitamin \"Essential vitamin\").[12]\n\nNot consuming enough folate can lead to [folate\ndeficiency](/wiki/Folate_deficiency \"Folate deficiency\").[8] This may result\nin a type of anemia in which [low numbers of large red blood\ncells](/wiki/Megaloblastic_anemia \"Megaloblastic anemia\") occur.[8] Symptoms\nmay include [feeling tired](/wiki/Fatigue_\\(medical\\) \"Fatigue \\(medical\\)\"),\n[heart palpitations](/wiki/Heart_palpitations \"Heart palpitations\"),\n[shortness of breath](/wiki/Shortness_of_breath \"Shortness of breath\"), open\nsores on the tongue and changes in the color of the skin or hair.[8] Folate\ndeficiency in children may develop within a month of poor dietary intake.[13]\nIn adults normal total body folate is between 10,000–30,000 micrograms (µg)\nwith blood levels of greater than 7 nmol/L (3 ng/mL).[8]\n\nFolic acid was discovered between 1931 and 1943.[14] It is on the [World\nHealth Organization's List of Essential\nMedicines](/wiki/World_Health_Organization%27s_List_of_Essential_Medicines\n\"World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines\"), the most effective\nand safe medicines needed in a [health system](/wiki/Health_system \"Health\nsystem\").[15] The wholesale cost of supplements in the [developing\nworld](/wiki/Developing_world \"Developing world\") is between 0.001 and 0.005\nUSD per dose as of 2014.[16] The term \"folic\" is from the Latin word\n_[folium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/folium \"wiktionary:folium\")_ , which\nmeans leaf.[17] Folates occur naturally in many foods especially dark green\nleafy [vegetables](/wiki/Vegetable \"Vegetable\") and [liver](/wiki/Liver\n\"Liver\").[8]\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 Definition\n  * 2 Health

many forms of the vitamin—namely folic\nacid and its [congeners](/wiki/Congener_\\(chemistry\\) \"Congener\n\\(chemistry\\)\"), including tetrahydrofolic acid (the activated form of the\nvitamin), methyltetrahydrofolate, methenyltetrahydrofolate, and folinic\nacid.[18][19][20] People sometimes confuse this use of \"folate\" with the use\nof \"folate\" in the standard [way of naming acids](/wiki/Acid#Nomenclature\n\"Acid\") in organic chemistry, in which the complete compound is called \"X-ic\nacid\" but is called \"X-ate\" when it loses a proton; acids shift back and forth\nbetween these forms based on the acidity of the solution in which they are\nfound. In this usage, \"folate\" is just \"folic acid\" in a non-acidic\nsolution.[21]\n\nOther names include vitamin B9,[1] vitamin Bc,[2] vitamin M,[3] folacin, and\npteroyl-L-glutamate.\n\n## Health effects[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit\nsection: Health effects\")]\n\n### Pregnancy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit\nsection: Pregnancy\")]\n\nFolate intake during pregnancy has been linked to a lessened risk of [neural\ntube defects](/wiki/Neural_tube_defects \"Neural tube defects\").[22] Likewise a\nmeta-analysis of folate [supplementation](/wiki/Dietary_supplement \"Dietary\nsupplement\") during pregnancy reported a 28% lower risk of newborn [congenital\nheart defects](/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect \"Congenital heart defect\").[23]\nThe [United States Preventive Services Task\nForce](/wiki/United_States_Preventive_Services_Task_Force \"United States\nPreventive Services Task Force\") recommends the folic acid supplementation for\nall women able to become pregnant; forms of folate other than folic acid have\nnot been studied for this use and are not recommended.[19]\n\nPrenatal supplementation with folic acid did not appear to reduce the risk of\npreterm births.[24][25] One [systematic review](/wiki/Systematic_review\n\"Systematic review\") indicated no effect of folic acid on mortality, growth,\nbody composition, respiratory, or cognitive outcomes of children from birth to\n9 years old.[26] There was no correlation between maternal folic acid\nsupplementation and an increased risk for childhood asthma.[27]\n\n### Fertility[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit\nsection: Fertility\")]\n\nFolate is necessary for [fertility](/wiki/Fertility \"Fertility\") in both men\nand women. It contributes to [spermatogenesis](/wiki/Spermatogenesis\n\"Spermatogenesis\"). Therefore, it is necessary to receive sufficient amounts\nthrough the diet to avoid [subfertility](/wiki/Subfertility\n\"Subfertility\").[28] Also, polymorphisms in genes of enzymes involved in\nfolate metabolism could be one reason for fertility complications in some\nwomen with [unexplained infertility](/wiki/Unexplained_infertility\n\"Unexplained infertility\").[29]\n\n### Heart disease[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit\nsection: Heart disease\")]\n\nTaking folic acid over years reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by\n4%,[11] where another study found it did not affect cardiovascular disease,\neven while reducing [homocysteine](/wiki/Homocysteine \"Homocysteine\")\nlevels.[30]\n\n### Stroke[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\nsection: Stroke\")]\n\nLong-term supplementation with folic acid reduced the risk of stroke by 10%,\nwhich may be due to the role folate plays in regulating homocysteine\nconcentration.[11] The reviews indicate the risk of stroke appears to be\nreduced only in some individuals, but a definite recommendation regarding\nsupplementation beyond the current RDA has not been established for stroke\nprevention.[31] Asian populations had greater protection against stroke with\nfolate supplementation than did European or North American subjects.[11]\n\nObserved stroke reduction is consistent with the reduction in [pulse\npressure](/wiki/Pulse_pressure \"Pulse pressure\") produced by folate\nsupplementation of 5 mg per day, since hypertension is a key risk factor for\nstroke. Folic supplements are inexpensive and relatively safe to use, which is\nwhy people who have had strokes or who have\n[hyperhomocysteinemia](/wiki/Hyperhomocysteinemia \"Hyperhomocysteinemia\") are\nencouraged to consume daily B vitamins including folic acid.[32]\n\n### Cancer[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit\nsection: Cancer\")]\n\nStudies on folic acid intake from food and folate supplementation with regards\nto cancer risk are based on the adequacy of chronic intake. Chronically\ninsufficient intake of folic acid (below the recommended level of 400\nmicrograms per day[6]) may increase the risk of\n[colorectal](/wiki/Colorectal_cancer \"Colorectal cancer\"), breast, ovarian,\npancreas, brain, lung, [cervical](/wiki/Cervical_cancer \"Cervical cancer\"),\nand [prostate](/wiki/Prostate_cancer \"Prostate cancer\")\ncancers.[33][34][35][36] Other studies showed that excessive dietary\nsupplementation with synthetic folate may increase the risk of certain\ncancers, in particular [prostate](/wiki/Prostate_cancer \"Prostate\ncancer\").[37][38] A 2017 review found no relationship between taking folate\nsupplements and cancer risk.[39]\n\n#### Antifolate\nchemotherapy[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit\nsection: Antifolate chemotherapy\")]\n\nFolate is important for cells and tissues that divide rapidly.[40] Cancer\ncells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used\nto treat cancer. The [antifolate](/wiki/Antifolate \"Antifolate\")\n[methotrexate](/wiki/Methotrexate \"Methotrexate\") is a drug often used to\ntreat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form of THF from\nthe inactive dihydrofolate (DHF). However, methotrexate can be\ntoxic,[41][42][43] producing side effects, such as inflammation in the\ndigestive tract that make it difficult to eat normally. Also, bone marrow\ndepression (inducing leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), and acute kidney and\nliver failure have been reported.\n\n[Folinic acid](/wiki/Folinic_acid \"Folinic acid\"), under the drug name\n[leucovorin](/wiki/Leucovorin \"Leucovorin\"), a form of folate (formyl-THF),\ncan help \"rescue\" or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate.[44] Folinic\nacid is _not_ the same as folic acid. Folic acid supplements have little\nestablished role in cancer chemotherapy.[45][46] There have been cases of\nsevere adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic\nacid in people receiving [methotrexate](/wiki/Methotrexate \"Methotrexate\")\ncancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to\nfollow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements. The\nsupplement of folinic acid in people undergoing methotrexate treatment is to\ngive cells dividing less rapidly enough folate to maintain normal cell\nfunctions. The amount of folate given is depleted by rapidly dividing cells\n(cancer) quickly, and so does not negate the effects of methotrexate.\n\n### Psychological[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit\nsection: Psychological\")]\n\nSome evidence links a shortage of folate with\n[depression](/wiki/Clinical_depression \"Clinical depression\").[47] Limited\nevidence from [randomised controlled\ntrials](/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trials \"Randomized controlled trials\")\nshowed using folic acid in addition to\n[SSRIs](/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor \"Selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitor\") may have benefits.[48] Research at the University of York\nand Hull York Medical School has found a link between depression and low\nlevels of folate.[49] One study by the same team involved 15,315 subjects.[50]\nFolic acid supplementation affects [noradrenaline](/wiki/Noradrenaline\n\"Noradrenaline\") and [serotonin](/wiki/Serotonin \"Serotonin\") receptors within\nthe brain, which could be the cause of folic acid's possible ability to act as\nan antidepressant.[51][52] The exact mechanisms involved in the development of\nschizophrenia and depression are not entirely clear, but the bioactive folate,\n[methyltetrahydrofolate](/wiki/Levomefolic_acid \"Levomefolic acid\") (5-MTHF),\na direct target of methyl donors like [S-adenosyl\nmethionine](/wiki/S-adenosyl_methionine \"S-adenosyl methionine\") (SAMe),\nrecycles the inactive [dihydrobiopterin](/wiki/Dihydrobiopterin\n\"Dihydrobiopterin\") (BH2) into [tetrahydrobiopterin](/wiki/Tetrahydrobiopterin\n\"Tetrahydrobiopterin\") (BH4), the necessary\n[cofactor](/wiki/Cofactor_\\(biochemistry\\) \"Cofactor \\(biochemistry\\)\") in\nvarious steps of [monoamine](/wiki/Monoamine \"Monoamine\") synthesis, including\nthat of [dopamine](/wiki/Dopamine \"Dopamine\"). BH4 serves a regulatory role in\nmonoamine neurotransmission and is required to mediate the actions of most\n[antidepressants](/wiki/Antidepressants \"Antidepressants\"). 5-MTHF also plays\nboth direct & indirect roles in [DNA methylation](/wiki/DNA_methylation \"DNA\nmethylation\"), NO2 synthesis, and one-carbon metabolism.[53]\n\n### Age related macular\ndegeneration[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit\nsection: Age related macular degeneration\")]\n\nA sub study of the Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study\npublished in 2009 reported use of a nutritional supplement containing folic\nacid, [pyridoxine](/wiki/Pyridoxine \"Pyridoxine\"), and\n[cyanocobalamin](/wiki/Cyanocobalamin \"Cyanocobalamin\") decreased the risk of\ndeveloping [age-related macular degeneration](/wiki/Age-\nrelated_macular_degeneration \"Age-related macular degeneration\") by 34.7%.[54]\nThe amount of folic acid used in this clinical trial – 2500 μg – was higher\nthan the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 1000 μg.\n\n### Folic acid, B12 and\niron[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section:\nFolic acid, B12 and iron\")]\n\nThere is a complex interaction between folic acid, [vitamin\nB12](/wiki/Vitamin_B12 \"Vitamin B12\") and iron. A deficiency of one may be\n\"masked\" by excess of another so the three must always be in\nbalance.[55][56][57]\n\n### Toxicity[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit\nsection: Toxicity\")]\n\nThe risk of toxicity from folic acid is low, because folate is a water-soluble\nvitamin and is regularly removed from the body through urine.[58] One\npotential issue associated with high dosages of folic acid is that it has a\nmasking effect on the diagnosis of [pernicious\nanaemia](/wiki/Pernicious_anaemia \"Pernicious anaemia\") (vitamin B12\ndeficiency),[59] and a variety of concerns[_[clarification\nneeded](/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify \"Wikipedia:Please clarify\")_] of\npotential negative impacts on health.[60]\n\n### Folate deficiency[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=13\n\"Edit section: Folate deficiency\")]\n\nMain article: [Folate deficiency](/wiki/Folate_deficiency \"Folate deficiency\")\n\nFolate deficiency can be caused by unhealthy diets that do not include enough\nfruits and vegetables, diseases in which folates are not well absorbed in the\ndigestive system (such as [Crohn's disease](/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease \"Crohn's\ndisease\") or [celiac disease](/wiki/Celiac_disease \"Celiac disease\")), some\ngenetic disorders that affect levels of folate, and certain medicines (such as\nphenytoin, sulfasalazine, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).[61] Folate\ndeficiency is accelerated by alcohol consumption.[62]\n\nFolate deficiency may lead to [glossitis](/wiki/Glossitis \"Glossitis\"),\ndiarrhea, depression, confusion, anemia, and fetal [neural tube\ndefects](/wiki/Neural_tube_defect \"Neural tube defect\") and brain defects\n(during pregnancy).[63] Other symptoms include fatigue, gray hair, mouth\nsores, poor growth, and swollen tongue.[61] Folate deficiency is diagnosed by\nanalyzing [CBC](/wiki/Complete_blood_count \"Complete blood count\") and plasma\nvitamin B12 and folate levels.[63] CBC may indicate megaloblastic anemia but\nthis could also be a sign of vitamin B12 deficiency.[63] A serum folate of 3\nμg/L or lower indicates deficiency.[63] Serum folate level reflects folate\nstatus but erythrocyte folate level better reflects tissue stores after\nintake.[63] Serum folate reacts more rapidly to folate intake than erythrocyte\nfolate.[64] An erythrocyte folate level of 140 μg/L or lower indicates\ninadequate folate status.[63] Increased homocysteine level suggests tissue\nfolate deficiency but homocysteine is also affected by vitamin B12 and vitamin\nB6, renal function, and genetics.[63]\n\nOne way to differentiate between folate (vitamin B9) deficiency from vitamin\nB12 deficiency is by testing for methylmalonic acid levels.[63] Normal MMA\nlevels indicate folate deficiency and elevated MMA levels indicate vitamin B12\ndeficiency.[63] Folate deficiency is treated with supplemental oral folic acid\nof 400 to 1000 μg per day. This treatment is very successful in replenishing\ntissues, even if deficiency was caused by malabsorption.[63] People with\nmegaloblastic anemia need to be tested for vitamin B12 deficiency before\ntreatment with folic acid, because if the person has vitamin B12 deficiency,\nfolic acid supplementation can remove the anemia, but can also worsen\nneurologic problems.[63] People who are morbidly obese with BMIs of greater\nthan 50 are more likely to develop folate deficiency.[65] People with celiac\ndisease have a higher chance of developing folate deficiency.[65] Cobalamin\ndeficiency may lead to folate deficiency, which, in turn, increases\nhomocysteine levels and may result in the development of cardiovascular\ndisease or birth defects.[66]\n\n### Malaria[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit\nsection: Malaria\")]\n\nSome studies show iron–folic acid supplementation in children under 5 may\nresult in increased mortality due to [malaria](/wiki/Malaria \"Malaria\"); this\nhas prompted the World Health Organization to alter their iron–folic acid\nsupplementation policies for children in malaria-prone areas, such as\nIndia.[67]\n\n## Dietary\nrecommendations[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit\nsection: Dietary recommendations\")]\n\nBecause of the difference in bioavailability between supplemented folic acid\nand the different forms of folate found in food, the dietary folate equivalent\n(DFE) system was established. One DFE is defined as 1 μg of dietary folate.\nOne μg of folic acid supplement counts as 1.7 μg DFE. The reason for the\ndifference is that at least 85% of folic acid is estimated to be bioavailable\nwhen taken with food, whereas only about 50% of folate naturally present in\nfood is bioavailable.[68]\n\n[National Institutes of Health](/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health \"National Institutes of Health\") (US) nutritional recommendations[68] (µg DFE per day for RDA, µg folic acid for UL ) Age | Infants (AI) | Infants ([UL](/wiki/Tolerable_upper_intake_levels \"Tolerable upper intake levels\")) | Adults (RDA) | Adults (UL) | Pregnant women (RDA) | Pregnant women (UL) | Lactating women (RDA) | Lactating women (UL)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n0–6 months | 65 | None set | – | – | – | – | – | –  \n7–12 months | 80 | None set | – | – | – | – | – | –  \n1–3 years | – | – | 150 | 300 | – | – | – | –  \n4–8 years | – | – | 200 | 400 | – | – | – |  –  \n9–13 years | – | – | 300 | 600 | – | – | – | –  \n14–18 | – | – | 400 | 800 | 600 | 800 | 500 | 800  \n19+ | – | – | 400 | 1000 | 600 | 1000 | 500 | 1000  \n  \nThe U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated [Recommended Dietary\nAllowances](/wiki/Recommended_Dietary_Allowance \"Recommended Dietary\nAllowance\") (RDAs) for folate in 2001. As for safety, the IOM sets [Tolerable\nupper intake levels](/wiki/Tolerable_upper_intake_level \"Tolerable upper\nintake level\") (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient.\nThe UL for folate refers to only micrograms of synthetic folic acid, as no\nhealth risks have been associated with high intake of folate from food\nsources. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [Dietary\nReference Intakes](/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake \"Dietary Reference Intake\")\n(DRIs).[68][69]\n\nThe [European Food Safety Authority](/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority\n\"European Food Safety Authority\") (EFSA) refers to the collective set of\ninformation as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake\n(PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL\ndefined the same as in United States. For women and men over age 18 the PRI is\nset at 330 μg/day. PRI for pregnancy is 600 μg/day, for lactation 500 μg/day.\nFor children ages 1–17 years the PRIs increase with age from 120 to 270\nμg/day. These values differ somewhat from the U.S. RDAs.[70] The EFSA also\nreviewed the safety question and agreed with United States that the UL be set\nat 1000 μg.[71]\n\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving\nis expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For folate labeling purposes\n100% of the Daily Value was 400 μg. As of May 27, 2016 update it was kept\nunchanged at 400 μg.[72] A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is\nprovided at [Reference Daily Intake](/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake \"Reference\nDaily Intake\").

In the late 1930s, folate was\nidentified as the corrective substance in brewer's yeast.\n\nIt was first isolated via extraction from [spinach](/wiki/Spinach \"Spinach\")\nleaves by [Herschel K. Mitchell](/wiki/Herschel_K._Mitchell \"Herschel K.\nMitchell\"), [Esmond E. Snell](/wiki/Esmond_E._Snell \"Esmond E. Snell\"), and\n[Roger J. Williams](/wiki/Roger_J._Williams \"Roger J.

In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists began to discover\nthe biochemical mechanisms of action for folate.[78] In 1960, experts first\nlinked folate deficiency to neural tube defects.[78] In the late 1990s, US\nscientists realized, despite the availability of folate in foods and in\nsupplements, there was still a challenge for people to meet their daily folate\nrequirements, which is when the US implemented the folate fortification\nprogram.[78]\n\n## Biological roles[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=18\n\"Edit section: Biological roles\")]\n\n### DNA and cell\ndivision[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit\nsection: DNA and cell division\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Folat.svg/220px-\nFolat.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Folat.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Folat.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nA diagram of the chemical structure of folate\n\nFolate is necessary for the production and maintenance of new\n[cells](/wiki/Cell_\\(biology\\) \"Cell \\(biology\\)\"), for [DNA\nsynthesis](/wiki/DNA_replication \"DNA replication\") and [RNA\nsynthesis](/wiki/RNA_synthesis \"RNA synthesis\") through\n[methylation](/wiki/Methylation \"Methylation\"), and for preventing changes to\n[DNA](/wiki/DNA \"DNA\"), and, thus, for preventing [cancer](/wiki/Cancer\n\"Cancer\").[40] It is especially important during periods of frequent cell\ndivision and growth, such as infancy and pregnancy. Folate is needed to carry\none-carbon groups for methylation reactions and [nucleic\nacid](/wiki/Nucleic_acid \"Nucleic acid\") synthesis (the most notable one being\nthymine, but also [purine](/wiki/Purine \"Purine\") bases).[82] Thus, folate\ndeficiency hinders DNA synthesis and cell division, affecting hematopoietic\ncells and neoplasms the most because of their greater frequency of cell\ndivision. RNA transcription, and subsequent protein synthesis, are less\naffected by folate deficiency, as the mRNA can be recycled and used again (as\nopposed to DNA synthesis, where a new genomic copy must be created). Since\nfolate deficiency limits cell division, [erythropoiesis](/wiki/Erythropoiesis\n\"Erythropoiesis\"), production of [red blood cells](/wiki/Red_blood_cell \"Red\nblood cell\"), is hindered and leads to [megaloblastic\nanemia](/wiki/Megaloblastic_anemia \"Megaloblastic anemia\"), which is\ncharacterized by large immature red blood cells. This pathology results from\npersistently thwarted attempts at normal DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell\ndivision, and produces abnormally large red cells called megaloblasts (and\nhypersegmented neutrophils) with abundant cytoplasm capable of RNA and protein\nsynthesis, but with clumping and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin. Some of\nthese large cells, although immature (reticulocytes), are released early from\nthe marrow in an attempt to compensate for the [anemia](/wiki/Anemia\n\"Anemia\").[83] Both adults and children need folate to make normal red and\nwhite blood cells and prevent [anemia](/wiki/Anemia \"Anemia\").[84] Deficiency\nof folate in pregnant women has been implicated in [neural tube\ndefects](/wiki/Neural_tube_defects \"Neural tube defects\") (NTD); therefore,\nmany developed countries have implemented mandatory folic acid fortification\nin cereals, etc. NTDs occur early in pregnancy (first month), therefore women\nmust have abundant folate upon conception. Folate is required to make [red\nblood cells](/wiki/Red_blood_cells \"Red blood cells\") and [white blood\ncells](/wiki/White_blood_cells \"White blood cells\") and folate deficiency may\nlead to [anemia](/wiki/Anemia \"Anemia\"), which causes\n[fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_\\(medical\\) \"Fatigue \\(medical\\)\"), weakness and\ninability to concentrate.[85]\n\n### DNA and amino acid\nproduction[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit\nsection: DNA and amino acid production\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Folicacid-B12.png/220px-\nFolicacid-B12.png)](/wiki/File:Folicacid-B12.png)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Folicacid-B12.png \"Enlarge\")\n\nMetabolism of folic acid to recycle [homocysteine](/wiki/Homocysteine\n\"Homocysteine\") into [methionine](/wiki/Methionine \"Methionine\")\n\nIn the form of a series of [tetrahydrofolate](/wiki/Tetrahydrofolate\n\"Tetrahydrofolate\") (THF) compounds, folate derivatives are\n[substrates](/wiki/Substrate_\\(biochemistry\\) \"Substrate \\(biochemistry\\)\") in\na number of single-carbon-transfer reactions, and also are involved in the\nsynthesis of [dTMP](/wiki/DTMP \"DTMP\") (2′-deoxythymidine-5′-phosphate) from\n[dUMP](/wiki/DUMP \"DUMP\") (2′-deoxyuridine-5′-phosphate). It is a substrate\nfor an important reaction that involves [vitamin B12](/wiki/Vitamin_B12\n\"Vitamin B12\") and it is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, and so required\nfor all dividing cells.[86]\n\nThe pathway leading to the formation of\n[tetrahydrofolate](/wiki/Tetrahydrofolate \"Tetrahydrofolate\") (FH4) begins\nwhen folic acid (F) is [reduced](/wiki/Redox \"Redox\") to\n[dihydrofolate](/wiki/Dihydrofolate \"Dihydrofolate\") (DHF) (FH2), which is\nthen reduced to THF. [Dihydrofolate reductase](/wiki/Dihydrofolate_reductase\n\"Dihydrofolate reductase\") catalyses the last step.[87] Vitamin B3 in the form\nof [NADPH](/wiki/NADPH \"NADPH\") is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the\nsynthesis. Thus, hydride molecules are transferred from NADPH to the C6\nposition of the pteridine ring to reduce folic acid to THF.[88]\n\n[Methylene-THF](/wiki/Methylene-THF \"Methylene-THF\") (CH2FH4) is formed from\nTHF by the addition of a [methylene bridge](/wiki/Methylene_bridge \"Methylene\nbridge\") from one of three carbon donors: [formate](/wiki/Formate \"Formate\"),\n[serine](/wiki/Serine \"Serine\"), or [glycine](/wiki/Glycine \"Glycine\").\n[Methyl tetrahydrofolate](/wiki/Methyl_tetrahydrofolate \"Methyl\ntetrahydrofolate\") (CH3-THF, or methyl-THF) can be made from methylene-THF by\nreduction of the methylene group with NADPH.\n\nAnother form of THF, 10-formyl-THF, results from [oxidation](/wiki/Oxidation\n\"Oxidation\") of methylene-THF or is formed from formate donating formyl group\nto THF. Also, histidine can donate a single carbon to THF to form methenyl-\nTHF.\n\nVitamin B12 is the only acceptor of methyl-THF, and this reaction produces\nmethyl-B12 ([methylcobalamin](/wiki/Methylcobalamin \"Methylcobalamin\")). There\nis also only one acceptor for methyl-B12, homocysteine, in a reaction\ncatalyzed by [homocysteine\nmethyltransferase](/wiki/Homocysteine_methyltransferase \"Homocysteine\nmethyltransferase\"). These reactions are important because a defect in\nhomocysteine methyltransferase or a deficiency of B12 may lead to a so-called\n\"methyl-trap\" of THF, in which THF converts to a reservoir of methyl-THF.\nThereafter, this THF has no way of being metabolized, and serves as a sink of\nTHF that causes a subsequent deficiency in folate.[80] Thus, a deficiency in\nB12 can generate a large pool of methyl-THF that is unable to undergo\nreactions and mimics folate deficiency.\n\nThe reactions that lead to the methyl-THF reservoir can be shown in chain\nform:\n\n    folate → dihydrofolate → tetrahydrofolate ↔ methylene-THF → methyl-THF\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Folate_metabolism.svg/220px-\nFolate_metabolism.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Folate_metabolism.svg)\n\n[](/wiki/File:Folate_metabolism.svg \"Enlarge\")\n\nFolate metabolism\n\n### Conversion to biologically active\nderivatives[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit\nsection: Conversion to biologically active derivatives\")]\n\nAll the biological functions of folic acid are performed by\n[tetrahydrofolate](/wiki/Tetrahydrofolate \"Tetrahydrofolate\") and other\nderivatives. Their biological availability to the body depends upon\n[dihydrofolate reductase](/wiki/Dihydrofolate_reductase \"Dihydrofolate\nreductase\") action in the liver. This action is unusually slow in humans,\nbeing less than 2% of that in rats (and with an almost-5-fold variation in\nenzymatic activity), leading to the accumulation of unmetabolized folic\nacid.[89] It has been suggested this low activity limits the conversion of\nfolic acid into its biologically active forms \"when folic acid is consumed at\nlevels higher than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (1 mg/d for adults).\"[89]\n\n#### Overview of drugs that interfere with folate\nreactions[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit\nsection: Overview of drugs that interfere with folate reactions\")]\n\nA number of drugs interfere with the biosynthesis of folic acid and THF.

In the USA, food is fortified with folic acid, only\none of the many naturally occurring forms of folate, and a substance\ncontributing only a minor amount to the folates in natural foods.[60]\n\nSince the discovery of the link between insufficient folic acid and [neural\ntube defects](/wiki/Neural_tube_defects \"Neural tube defects\"), governments\nand health organizations worldwide have made recommendations concerning folic\nacid _[supplementation](/wiki/Dietary_supplement \"Dietary supplement\")_ for\nwomen intending to become [pregnant](/wiki/Pregnancy \"Pregnancy\").\n\nFortification is controversial, with issues having been raised concerning\nindividual liberty,[60] as well as the health concerns described in the\nToxicity section above. In the USA, there is concern that the federal\ngovernment mandates fortification, but does not provide monitoring of\npotential undesirable effects of fortification.[60]\n\n76 countries worldwide require mandatory folic acid fortification of at least\none major cereal grain, with nearly all fortifying at least wheat flour,\naccording to November 2013 data from the Food Fortification Initiative.[93]\nThese countries are:\n\n    Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine (Occupied Territory), Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Republic of Moldova, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Suriname, Tanzania (United Republic of), Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United States of America, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.[93]\n\nAs of November 2013, no [EU](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\") country\nhas mandated folic acid fortification.[93]\n\n### Australia[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit\nsection: Australia\")]\n\nThere has been previous debate in [Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\")\nregarding the inclusion of folic acid in products such as [bread](/wiki/Bread\n\"Bread\") and [flour](/wiki/Flour \"Flour\").[94]\n\n[Australia](/wiki/Australia \"Australia\") and [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand\n\"New Zealand\") have jointly agreed to fortification though the [Food Standards\nAustralia New Zealand](/wiki/Food_Standards_Australia_New_Zealand \"Food\nStandards Australia New Zealand\"). Australia will fortify all flour from 18\nSeptember 2009.[95] Although the food standard covers both Australia and New\nZealand, an Australian government official has stated it is up to New Zealand\nto decide whether to implement it there, and they will watch with\ninterest.[96]\n\nThe requirement is 0.135 mg of folate per 100g of bread.\n\n### Canada[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit\nsection: Canada\")]\n\nIn 2003, a [Hospital for Sick Children](/wiki/Hospital_for_Sick_Children\n\"Hospital for Sick Children\"), [University of\nToronto](/wiki/University_of_Toronto \"University of Toronto\") research group\npublished findings showing the fortification of flour with folic acid in\nCanada has resulted in a dramatic decrease in\n[neuroblastoma](/wiki/Neuroblastoma \"Neuroblastoma\"), an early and very\ndangerous cancer in young children.[97] In 2009, further evidence from [McGill\nUniversity](/wiki/McGill_University \"McGill University\") showed a 6.2%\ndecrease per year in the birth prevalence of severe congenital heart\ndefects.[98]\n\nFolic acid used in fortified [foods](/wiki/Food \"Food\") is a synthetic form\ncalled pteroylmonoglutamate.[99] It is in its [oxidized](/wiki/Oxidized\n\"Oxidized\") state and contains only one\n[conjugated](/wiki/Conjugation_\\(biochemistry\\) \"Conjugation\n\\(biochemistry\\)\") [glutamate](/wiki/Glutamate \"Glutamate\") residue.[99] Folic\nacid therefore enters via a different carrier system from naturally occurring\nfolate, and this may have different effects on folate binding proteins and its\ntransporters.[100] Folic acid has a higher bioavailability than natural\nfolates and are rapidly absorbed across the intestine;[99] therefore, it is\nimportant to consider the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) when calculating\none's intake. Natural occurring folate is equal to 1 DFE;, however, 0.6 µg of\nfolic acid is equal to 1 DFE.\n\nFolic acid [food fortification](/wiki/Food_fortification \"Food fortification\")\nbecame mandatory in [Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") in 1998, with the\nfortification of 150 µg of folic acid per 100 grams of [enriched\nflour](/wiki/Enriched_flour \"Enriched flour\") and uncooked\n[cereal](/wiki/Cereal \"Cereal\") grains.[101] The purpose of fortification was\nto decrease the risk of [neural tube defects](/wiki/Neural_tube_defects\n\"Neural tube defects\") in [newborns](/wiki/Newborns \"Newborns\").[101] It is\nimportant to fortify grains because it is a widely eaten food and the neural\ntube closes in the first four weeks of gestation, often before many women even\nknow they are pregnant. Canada's fortification program has been successful\nwith a decrease of neural tube defects by 19% since its introduction.[102] A\nseven-province study from 1993 to 2002 showed a reduction of 46% in the\noverall rate of neural tube defects after folic acid fortification was\nintroduced in Canada.[103] The fortification program was estimated to raise a\nperson’s folic acid intake level by 70–130 µg/day; however, an increase of\nalmost double that amount was actually observed.[102] This could be from the\nfact that many foods are over fortified by 160–175% the predicted value.[102]\nIn addition, much of the elder population take\n[supplements](/wiki/Dietary_supplement \"Dietary supplement\") that adds 400 µg\nto their daily folic acid intake. This is a concern because 70–80% of the\npopulation have detectable levels of unmetabolized folic acid in their\n[blood](/wiki/Blood \"Blood\") and high intakes can accelerate the growth of\n[preneoplastic\nlesions](/w/index.php?title=Preneoplastic_lesions&action=edit&redlink=1\n\"Preneoplastic lesions \\(page does not exist\\)\").[104] It is still unknown the\namount of folic acid supplementation that might cause harm.[101]\n\n#### Supplementation\npromotion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit\nsection: Supplementation promotion\")]\n\nAccording to a Canadian survey, 58% of women said they took a folic acid\ncontaining multivitamin or a folic acid supplement as early as three months\nbefore becoming pregnant. Women in higher income households and with more\nyears of school education are using more folic acid supplements before\npregnancy. Women with planned pregnancies and who are over the age of 25 are\nmore likely to use folic acid supplement. Canadian public health efforts are\nfocused on promoting awareness of the importance of folic acid supplementation\nfor all women of childbearing age and decreasing socio-economic inequalities\nby providing practical folic acid support to vulnerable groups of women.[103]\n\n### New Zealand[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=27 \"Edit\nsection: New Zealand\")]\n\nNew Zealand was planning to fortify bread (excluding organic and unleavened\nvarieties) from 18 September 2009, but has opted to wait until more research\nis done.[95]\n\nThe Association of Bakers [105] and the [Green\nParty](/wiki/Green_Party_of_Aotearoa_New_Zealand \"Green Party of Aotearoa New\nZealand\") [106] have opposed mandatory fortification, describing it as \"mass\nmedication\". Food Safety Minister [Kate\nWilkinson](/wiki/Kate_Wilkinson_\\(politician\\) \"Kate Wilkinson\n\\(politician\\)\") reviewed the decision to fortify in July 2009, citing links\nbetween overconsumption of folate with cancer .[107] The New Zealand\nGovernment is reviewing whether it will continue with the mandatory\nintroduction of folic acid to bread.[108]\n\n### United Kingdom[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=28\n\"Edit section: United Kingdom\")]\n\nThere has been previous debate in the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom\n\"United Kingdom\") regarding the inclusion of folic acid in products such as\n[bread](/wiki/Bread \"Bread\") and [flour](/wiki/Flour \"Flour\").[109] While the\n[Food Standards Agency](/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency \"Food Standards Agency\")\nhas recommended folic acid fortification,[110][111][112] and wheat flour is\nfortified with iron,[93] folic acid fortification of wheat flour is allowed\nvoluntarily rather than required.\n\n### United States[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=29\n\"Edit section: United States\")]\n\nThe [United States Public Health\nService](/wiki/United_States_Public_Health_Service \"United States Public\nHealth Service\") recommends an extra 0.4 mg/day for newly pregnant women,\nwhich they can take as a pill. However, many researchers believe this\nsupplementation can never work effectively enough, since about half of all\npregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned, and not all women comply with the\nrecommendation. Approximately 53% of the US population uses dietary\nsupplements and 35% uses dietary supplements that contain folic acid.[113]\n\nMen consume more folate (in dietary folate equivalents) than women, and non-\nHispanic whites have higher folate intakes than Mexican Americans and non-\nHispanic blacks.[113] Twenty-nine percent of black women have inadequate\nintakes of folate.[113] The age group consuming the most folate and folic acid\nis the >50 group.[113] 5% of the population exceeds the Tolerable Upper Intake\nLevel.[113]\n\nIn 1996, the United States [Food and Drug\nAdministration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration \"Food and Drug\nAdministration\") (FDA) published regulations requiring the addition of folic\nacid to enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pastas, rice, and other\ngrain products.[114][115] This ruling took effect on 1 January 1998, and was\nspecifically targeted to reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects in\nnewborns.[116] There are concerns that the amount of folate added is\ninsufficient .[117] In October 2006, the Australian press claimed that U.S.\nregulations requiring fortification of grain products were being interpreted\nas disallowing fortification in non-grain products, specifically\n[Vegemite](/wiki/Vegemite \"Vegemite\") (an Australian [yeast\nextract](/wiki/Yeast_extract \"Yeast extract\") containing folate). The FDA\nlater said the report was inaccurate, and no ban or other action was being\ntaken against Vegemite.[118]\n\nAs a result of the folic acid fortification program, fortified foods have\nbecome a major source of folic acid in the American diet.[8] The [Centers for\nDisease Control and\nPrevention](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention \"Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention\") in [Atlanta, Georgia](/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia\n\"Atlanta, Georgia\") used data from 23 birth defect registries covering about\nhalf of United States births, and extrapolated their findings to the rest of\nthe country. These data indicate that, since the addition of folic acid in\ngrain-based foods as mandated by the FDA, the rate of neural tube defects\ndropped by 25% in the United States.[119] Before folic acid fortification,\nabout 4,100 pregnancies were affected by a neural tube defect each year in the\nUnited States. After fortification, this number declined to around 3,000.[120]\nThe results of folic acid fortification on the rate of neural tube defects in\n[Canada](/wiki/Canada \"Canada\") have also been positive, showing a 46%\nreduction in prevalence of NTDs;[121] the magnitude of reduction was\nproportional to the prefortification rate of NTDs, essentially removing\ngeographical variations in rates of NTDs seen in [Canada](/wiki/Canada\n\"Canada\") before fortification.\n\nWhen the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the folic acid fortification\nregulation in 1996, the projected increase in folic acid intake was 100\nµg/d.[122] Data from a study with 1480 subjects showed that folic acid intake\nincreased by 190 µg/d and total folate intake increased by 323 µg dietary\nfolate equivalents (DFE)/d.[122] Folic acid intake above the upper tolerable\nintake level (1000 µg folic acid/d) increased only among those individuals\nconsuming folic acid supplements as well as folic acid found in fortified\ngrain products.[122] Taken together, folic acid fortification has led to a\nbigger increase in folic acid intake than first projected.[122]\n\n## See also[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=30 \"Edit\nsection: See also\")]\n\n  * [Levomefolic acid](/wiki/Levomefolic_acid \"Levomefolic acid\")\n  * [Pteridine](/wiki/Pteridine \"Pteridine\")\n\n## References[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Folate&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit\nsection: References\")]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: _**a**_ _**b**_ Fenech, Michael (May 2012). \"Folate (vitamin B9) and vitamin B12 and their function in the maintenance of nuclear and mitochondrial genome integrity\". _Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis_. **733** (1–2): 21–33.
