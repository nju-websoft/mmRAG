In the year 2013-14, mineral fuels\n(HS code 27) were the largest traded item with 181.383 billion US$ worth\nimports and 64.685 billion US$ worth re-exports after refining. In the year\n2013-14, [gold and its finished items](/wiki/Gold_Control_Act \"Gold Control\nAct\") (HS code 71) were the second largest traded items with 58.465 billion\nUS$ worth imports and 41.692 billion US$ worth re-exports after value\naddition. These two goods are constituting 53% total imports, 34% total\nexports and nearly 100% of total [trade deficit](/wiki/Balance_of_trade\n\"Balance of trade\") (136 billion US$) of India in the financial year\n2013-14.[2] The services trade (exports and imports) are not part of\ncommodities trade. The trade surplus in services trade is US$ 73 billions in\nthe year 2013-14.[3]\n\nCounting the European Union as one, the WTO ranks India fifth for commercial\nservices exports and sixth for
