Its powers and responsibilities vary greatly from\ncountry to country, but generally cover the setting of rules as well as\nenforcing them for financial intermediaries and [stock\nexchanges](/wiki/Stock_exchange \"Stock exchange\").\n\n## Contents\n\n[hide]\n\n  * 1 History\n  * 2 Structure\n    * 2.1 Naming\n    * 2.2 Common features\n    * 2.3 International cooperation\n  * 3 Agencies\n  * 4 See also\n  * 5 References\n\n##\nHistory[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Securities_commission&action=edit&section=1\n\"Edit section: History\")]\n\nAs long as there have been securities there have been regulations. However, in\nthe early days this consisted primarily of self-regulated groups or societies.\nExternal government regulation has primarily been driven by financial crises\nor scandals.\n\nAs early as the 13th century the king [Edward I of\nEngland](/wiki/Edward_I_of_England \"Edward I of England\") decreed that brokers\nshould be licensed after he was forced to go to local money brokers that give\nmuch less favorable terms then his Italian brokers after the start of the\nAnglo-French war.\n\nIn 1720 the British Parliament passed the [Bubble Act](/wiki/Bubble_Act\n\"Bubble Act\") which had specific regulations for securities. However the\nmotive of this act was more to support the ‘South Sea bubble’ than protect\nconsumers. However this was the first time that prospectuses and disclosure in\nthe modern sense were used. There was widespread distrust of brokers as the\nscams collapsed.\n\nIn the United States, although Massachusetts required the registration of\nrailroad securities as early as 1852, and other states passed laws relating to\nsecurities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the real push for\nsecurities regulation came from the Midwestern and far western states. After\ncommon feeling that investors in these areas of the country were being\nvictimized by capitalists in the east.\n\nHowever it was the failure of the [Blue sky law](/wiki/Blue_sky_law \"Blue sky\nlaw\") and the 1930 financial crisis and [Great\nDepression](/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\") that led the United\nStates government to pass legislation in 1934 to strengthen securities law and\nfor the first time create a separate agency the [Securities and Exchange\nCommission](/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission \"U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission\").\n\nIn the early 1980s as many countries deregulated their financial markets, they\ncreated specific government agencies to police the securities markets and\nstock exchanges so as to separate regulation from operation of financial\nmarkets. Some countries like the UK, created one large agency that covered all\nfinancial products. However, some countries use a different model where there\nare separate agencies for different financial products. Typically, securities,\nbanking and insurance are split, but there may also be separate agencies for\nfutures, options and commodities.\n\nWith the advent of derivatives and new financial products it has not always\nbeen easy to see who has jurisdiction and what their responsibilities are. A\nfact, that some unscrupulous financial companies have used to their advantage\nto skirt existing regulation.\n\nThe [Financial crisis of\n2007–2010](/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932010 \"Financial crisis of\n2007–2010\") has seen much criticism of the securities regulators for failing\nto stop abuses of markets and their slowness in responding to the crisis and\nhaving suffered [regulatory capture](/wiki/Regulatory_capture \"Regulatory\ncapture\").\n\n##\nStructure[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Securities_commission&action=edit&section=2\n\"Edit section: Structure\")]\n\nMost securities commissions are semi-independent government organisations that\nhave a board of commissioners, usually appointed by the government of the\ncountry. They are often fully or partially funded by the organisations that\nare regulated through charges such as registration and licensing fees.\n\n###\nNaming[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Securities_commission&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Naming\")]\n\nThere is no common name for securities commission or financial regulatory\nagency in each country. Naming has become more complicated as some governments\nhave consolidated or merged organisations and given them a wider remit. They\nsometimes contain the term securities and commission. Such as the [Securities\nand Exchange Commission](/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission \"Securities\nand Exchange Commission\") of the US or [Securities and Futures Commission\n(Hong Kong)](/wiki/Securities_and_Futures_Commission_\\(Hong_Kong\\) \"Securities\nand Futures Commission \\(Hong Kong\\)\"). A number also have names based on\nFinancial Authority, such as the [Financial Services\nAuthority](/wiki/Financial_Services_Authority \"Financial Services Authority\")\nof the UK or [Financial Supervisory Authority\n(Sweden)](/wiki/Financial_Supervisory_Authority_\\(Sweden\\) \"Financial\nSupervisory Authority \\(Sweden\\)\") or variations such as the [Financial\nServices Agency (Japan)](/wiki/Financial_Services_Agency_\\(Japan\\) \"Financial\nServices Agency \\(Japan\\)\").\n\n### Common\nfeatures[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Securities_commission&action=edit&section=4\n\"Edit section: Common features\")]\n\nMost securities commissions have a mandate to protect consumers, make sure\nthere is an orderly and stable financial market and that brokers and\nparticipants behave fairly with clients and each other. Often local stock\nexchanges as well as brokers are covered by the commission.\n\n### International\ncooperation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Securities_commission&action=edit&section=5\n\"Edit section: International cooperation\")]\n\nMost financial regulators are members of the [International Organization of\nSecurities\nCommissions](/wiki/International_Organization_of_Securities_Commissions\n\"International Organization of Securities Commissions\") (IOSCO), an\norganisation that helps securities commissions cooperate. The main way that\nsecurities commission cooperate is through the IOSCO Memorandum of\nUnderstanding, or through bilateral agreements between securities commissions.\n\nWithin the European Union there is the [European Securities and Markets\nAuthority](/wiki/European_Securities_and_Markets_Authority \"European\nSecurities and Markets Authority\") (ESMA) which is advisory body for the\nEuropean Commission [1] which attempts to coordinate rules between EU\nsecurities commissions.\n\n##\nAgencies[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Securities_commission&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section:
