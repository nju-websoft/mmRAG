[Piper\nKerman](/wiki/Piper_Kerman \"Piper Kerman\")'s memoir after a friend sent it to\nher. She then set up a meeting with Kerman to pitch her on a TV adaptation,\nwhich she notes she \"screwed up\" as she spent most of the time asking Kerman\nabout her experiences she described in the book rather than selling her on the\nshow. This appealed to Kerman as it let her know that she was a fan and she\nsigned off on the adaptation.[9] Kohan would later go on to describe the main\ncharacter, Piper Chapman, as a \"[trojan horse](/wiki/Trojan_horse \"Trojan\nhorse\")\" for the series, allowing it to focus on characters whose demographics\nwould not normally be represented on TV.[10]\n\nIn July 2011, it was revealed that Netflix was in negotiations with Lionsgate\nfor a 13-episode TV adaptation of Kerman's memoirs with Kohan as creator.[11]\nIn November 2011, negotiations were finalized and the series had been\n[greenlit](/wiki/Greenlit \"Greenlit\").[12] Casting announcements began in\nAugust 2012 with [Taylor Schilling](/wiki/Taylor_Schilling \"Taylor\nSchilling\"), the first to be cast, in the lead role as Piper Chapman,[13]\nfollowed by [Jason Biggs](/wiki/Jason_Biggs \"Jason Biggs\") as Piper's fiancé\nLarry Bloom.[14]\n\nLaura Prepon and [Yael Stone](/wiki/Yael_Stone \"Yael Stone\") were next to join\nthe series.[2] [Abigail Savage](/wiki/Abigail_Savage \"Abigail Savage\"), who\nplays Gina, and [Alysia Reiner](/wiki/Alysia_Reiner \"Alysia Reiner\"), who\nplays Fig, had auditioned for role of Alex Vause.[9][15] Prepon initially\nauditioned for Piper Chapman,[16] however Kohan felt she would not worry about\nher [in prison], noting a \"toughness and a presence to her that wasn’t right\nfor the character.\" Kohan instead gave her the role of Alex.[9] Stone had\noriginally auditioned for the role of Nicky Nichols, but she was not\nconsidered \"tough enough\" for the character;[17] she was asked to audition for\nLorna Morello instead.[18] Likability was important for Morello, whom casting\ndirector Jen Euston deemed \"a very helpful, nice, sweet Italian girl.\"[18]\n[Laverne Cox](/wiki/Laverne_Cox \"Laverne Cox\"), a black\n[transgender](/wiki/Transgender \"Transgender\") woman, was cast as Sophia\nBurset, a transgender character. _[The Advocate](/wiki/The_Advocate \"The\nAdvocate\")_ touted _Orange Is the New Black_ as possibly the first women-in-\nprison narrative to cast a transgender woman for this type of role.[19]\nNatasha Lyonne was to audition for Alex, but was asked to read for the\ncharacter Nicky Nichols; \"[Kohan knew] she could do Nicky with her eyes\nclosed. She was perfect,\" said Euston.[18] Uzo Aduba read for the part of\nJanae Watson but was offered the character Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\"\nWarren.[18][20] Taryn Manning was offered the role of Tiffany \"Pennsatucky\"\nDoggett.[18] _[This American Life](/wiki/This_American_Life \"This American\nLife\")_ host [Ira Glass](/wiki/Ira_Glass \"Ira Glass\") was offered a role as a\n[public radio](/wiki/Public_radio \"Public radio\") [host](/wiki/Radio_host\n\"Radio host\"), but he declined.
